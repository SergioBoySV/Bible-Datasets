Jeremiah,7,19,"Do they spite Me?” declares the L ord . “Is it not themselves they spite, to their own shame?”"
Jeremiah,7,20,"Therefore thus says the Lord G od , “Behold, My anger and My wrath will be poured out on this place, on man and on beast and on the trees of the field and on the fruit of the ground; and it will burn and not be quenched.”"
Jeremiah,7,21,"Thus says the L ord of hosts, the God of Israel, “Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices and eat flesh."
Jeremiah,7,22,"For I did not speak to your fathers, or command them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings and sacrifices."
Jeremiah,7,23,"But this is what I commanded them, saying, ‘Obey My voice, and I will be your God, and you will be My people; and you will walk in all the way which I command you, that it may be well with you.’"
Jeremiah,7,24,"Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but walked in their own counsels and in the stubbornness of their evil heart, and went backward and not forward."
Jeremiah,7,25,"Since the day that your fathers came out of the land of Egypt until this day, I have sent you all My servants the prophets, daily rising early and sending them."
Jeremiah,7,26,"Yet they did not listen to Me or incline their ear, but stiffened their neck; they did more evil than their fathers."
Jeremiah,7,27,"“You shall speak all these words to them, but they will not listen to you; and you shall call to them, but they will not answer you."
Jeremiah,7,28,"You shall say to them, ‘This is the nation that did not obey the voice of the L ord their God or accept correction; truth has perished and has been cut off from their mouth."
Jeremiah,7,29,"Cut off your hair and cast it away, And take up a lamentation on the bare heights; For the L ord has rejected and forsaken The generation of His wrath.’"
Jeremiah,7,30,"For the sons of Judah have done that which is evil in My sight,” declares the L ord , “they have set their detestable things in the house which is called by My name, to defile it."
Jeremiah,7,31,"They have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire, which I did not command, and it did not come into My mind."
Jeremiah,7,32,"“Therefore, behold, days are coming,” declares the L ord , “when it will no longer be called Topheth, or the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of the Slaughter; for they will bury in Topheth because there is no other place."
Jeremiah,7,33,The dead bodies of this people will be food for the birds of the sky and for the beasts of the earth; and no one will frighten them away.
Jeremiah,7,34,"Then I will make to cease from the cities of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride; for the land will become a ruin."
Jeremiah,8,1,"“At that time,” declares the L ord , “they will bring out the bones of the kings of Judah and the bones of its princes, and the bones of the priests and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem from their graves."
Jeremiah,8,2,"They will spread them out to the sun, the moon and to all the host of heaven, which they have loved and which they have served, and which they have gone after and which they have sought, and which they have worshiped. They will not be gathered or buried; they will be as dung on the face of the ground."
Jeremiah,8,3,"And death will be chosen rather than life by all the remnant that remains of this evil family, that remains in all the places to which I have driven them,” declares the L ord of hosts."
Jeremiah,8,4,"“You shall say to them, ‘Thus says the L ord, “Do men fall and not get up again? Does one turn away and not repent?"
Jeremiah,8,5,"Why then has this people, Jerusalem, Turned away in continual apostasy? They hold fast to deceit, They refuse to return."
Jeremiah,8,6,"I have listened and heard, They have spoken what is not right; No man repented of his wickedness, Saying, ‘What have I done?’ Everyone turned to his course, Like a horse charging into the battle."
Jeremiah,8,7,Even the stork in the sky Knows her seasons; And the turtledove and the swift and the thrush Observe the time of their migration; But My people do not know The ordinance of the L ord.
Jeremiah,8,8,"“How can you say, ‘We are wise, And the law of the L ord is with us’? But behold, the lying pen of the scribes Has made it into a lie."
Jeremiah,8,9,"The wise men are put to shame, They are dismayed and caught; Behold, they have rejected the word of the L ord, And what kind of wisdom do they have?"
Jeremiah,8,10,"Therefore I will give their wives to others, Their fields to new owners; Because from the least even to the greatest Everyone is greedy for gain; From the prophet even to the priest Everyone practices deceit."
Jeremiah,8,11,"They heal the brokenness of the daughter of My people superficially, Saying, ‘Peace, peace,’ But there is no peace."
Jeremiah,8,12,"Were they ashamed because of the abomination they had done? They certainly were not ashamed, And they did not know how to blush; Therefore they shall fall among those who fall; At the time of their punishment they shall be brought down,” Says the L ord."
Jeremiah,8,13,"“I will surely snatch them away,” declares the L ord; “There will be no grapes on the vine And no figs on the fig tree, And the leaf will wither; And what I have given them will pass away.” ’ ”"
Jeremiah,8,14,"Why are we sitting still? Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the fortified cities And let us perish there, Because the L ord our God has doomed us And given us poisoned water to drink, For we have sinned against the L ord."
Jeremiah,8,15," We waited for peace, but no good came; For a time of healing, but behold, terror!"
Jeremiah,8,16,"From Dan is heard the snorting of his horses; At the sound of the neighing of his stallions The whole land quakes; For they come and devour the land and its fullness, The city and its inhabitants."
Jeremiah,8,17,"“For behold, I am sending serpents against you, Adders, for which there is no charm, And they will bite you,” declares the L ord."
Jeremiah,8,18,"My sorrow is beyond healing, My heart is faint within me!"
Jeremiah,8,19,"Behold, listen! The cry of the daughter of my people from a distant land: “Is the L ord not in Zion? Is her King not within her?” “Why have they provoked Me with their graven images, with foreign idols?”"
Jeremiah,8,20,"“Harvest is past, summer is ended, And we are not saved.”"
Jeremiah,8,21,"For the brokenness of the daughter of my people I am broken; I mourn, dismay has taken hold of me."
Jeremiah,8,22,Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then has not the health of the daughter of my people been restored?
Jeremiah,9,1,"Oh that my head were waters And my eyes a fountain of tears, That I might weep day and night For the slain of the daughter of my people!"
Jeremiah,9,2,"Oh that I had in the desert A wayfarers’ lodging place; That I might leave my people And go from them! For all of them are adulterers, An assembly of treacherous men."
Jeremiah,9,3,"“They bend their tongue like their bow; Lies and not truth prevail in the land; For they proceed from evil to evil, And they do not know Me,” declares the L ord."
Jeremiah,9,4,"“Let everyone be on guard against his neighbor, And do not trust any brother; Because every brother deals craftily, And every neighbor goes about as a slanderer."
Jeremiah,9,5,"Everyone deceives his neighbor And does not speak the truth, They have taught their tongue to speak lies; They weary themselves committing iniquity."
Jeremiah,9,6,"Your dwelling is in the midst of deceit; Through deceit they refuse to know Me,” declares the L ord."
Jeremiah,9,7,"Therefore thus says the L ord of hosts, “Behold, I will refine them and assay them; For what else can I do, because of the daughter of My people?"
Jeremiah,9,8,"Their tongue is a deadly arrow; It speaks deceit; With his mouth one speaks peace to his neighbor, But inwardly he sets an ambush for him."
Jeremiah,9,9,Shall I not punish them for these things?” declares the L ord. “On a nation such as this Shall I not avenge Myself?
Jeremiah,9,10,"“For the mountains I will take up a weeping and wailing, And for the pastures of the wilderness a dirge, Because they are laid waste so that no one passes through, And the lowing of the cattle is not heard; Both the birds of the sky and the beasts have fled; they are gone."
Jeremiah,9,11,"I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins, A haunt of jackals; And I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.”"
Jeremiah,9,12,"Who is the wise man that may understand this? And who is he to whom the mouth of the L ord has spoken, that he may declare it? Why is the land ruined, laid waste like a desert, so that no one passes through?"
Jeremiah,9,13,"The L ord said, “Because they have forsaken My law which I set before them, and have not obeyed My voice nor walked according to it,"
Jeremiah,9,14,"but have walked after the stubbornness of their heart and after the Baals, as their fathers taught them,”"
Jeremiah,9,15,"therefore thus says the L ord of hosts, the God of Israel, “behold, I will feed them, this people, with wormwood and give them poisoned water to drink."
Jeremiah,9,16,"I will scatter them among the nations, whom neither they nor their fathers have known; and I will send the sword after them until I have annihilated them.”"
Jeremiah,9,17,"Thus says the L ord of hosts, “Consider and call for the mourning women, that they may come; And send for the wailing women, that they may come!"
Jeremiah,9,18,"Let them make haste and take up a wailing for us, That our eyes may shed tears And our eyelids flow with water."
Jeremiah,9,19,"For a voice of wailing is heard from Zion, ‘How are we ruined! We are put to great shame, For we have left the land, Because they have cast down our dwellings.’ ”"
Jeremiah,9,20,"Now hear the word of the L ord , O you women, And let your ear receive the word of His mouth; Teach your daughters wailing, And everyone her neighbor a dirge."
Jeremiah,9,21,"For death has come up through our windows; It has entered our palaces To cut off the children from the streets, The young men from the town squares."
Jeremiah,9,22,"Speak, “Thus says the L ord, ‘The corpses of men will fall like dung on the open field, And like the sheaf after the reaper, But no one will gather them. ’ ”"
Jeremiah,9,23,"Thus says the L ord , “Let not a wise man boast of his wisdom, and let not the mighty man boast of his might, let not a rich man boast of his riches;"
Jeremiah,9,24,"but let him who boasts boast of this, that he understands and knows Me, that I am the L ord who exercises lovingkindness, justice and righteousness on earth; for I delight in these things,” declares the L ord."
Jeremiah,9,25,"“Behold, the days are coming,” declares the L ord , “that I will punish all who are circumcised and yet uncircumcised—"
Jeremiah,9,26,"Egypt and Judah, and Edom and the sons of Ammon, and Moab and all those inhabiting the desert who clip the hair on their temples; for all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised of heart.”"
Jeremiah,10,1,"Hear the word which the L ord speaks to you, O house of Israel."
Jeremiah,10,2,"Thus says the L ord, “Do not learn the way of the nations, And do not be terrified by the signs of the heavens Although the nations are terrified by them;"
Jeremiah,10,3,"For the customs of the peoples are delusion; Because it is wood cut from the forest, The work of the hands of a craftsman with a cutting tool."
Jeremiah,10,4,They decorate it with silver and with gold; They fasten it with nails and with hammers So that it will not totter.
Jeremiah,10,5,"Like a scarecrow in a cucumber field are they, And they cannot speak; They must be carried, Because they cannot walk! Do not fear them, For they can do no harm, Nor can they do any good.”"
Jeremiah,10,6,"There is none like You, O L ord; You are great, and great is Your name in might."
Jeremiah,10,7,"Who would not fear You, O King of the nations? Indeed it is Your due! For among all the wise men of the nations And in all their kingdoms, There is none like You."
Jeremiah,10,8,But they are altogether stupid and foolish In their discipline of delusion—their idol is wood!
Jeremiah,10,9,"Beaten silver is brought from Tarshish, And gold from Uphaz, The work of a craftsman and of the hands of a goldsmith; Violet and purple are their clothing; They are all the work of skilled men."
Jeremiah,10,10,"But the L ord is the true God; He is the living God and the everlasting King. At His wrath the earth quakes, And the nations cannot endure His indignation."
Jeremiah,10,11,"Thus you shall say to them, “The gods that did not make the heavens and the earth will perish from the earth and from under the heavens.”"
Jeremiah,10,12," It is He who made the earth by His power, Who established the world by His wisdom; And by His understanding He has stretched out the heavens."
Jeremiah,10,13,"When He utters His voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, And He causes the clouds to ascend from the end of the earth; He makes lightning for the rain, And brings out the wind from His storehouses."
Jeremiah,10,14,"Every man is stupid, devoid of knowledge; Every goldsmith is put to shame by his idols; For his molten images are deceitful, And there is no breath in them."
Jeremiah,10,15,"They are worthless, a work of mockery; In the time of their punishment they will perish."
Jeremiah,10,16,"The portion of Jacob is not like these; For the Maker of all is He, And Israel is the tribe of His inheritance; The L ord of hosts is His name."
Jeremiah,10,17,"Pick up your bundle from the ground, You who dwell under siege!"
Jeremiah,10,18,"For thus says the L ord, “Behold, I am slinging out the inhabitants of the land At this time, And will cause them distress, That they may be found.”"
Jeremiah,10,19,"Woe is me, because of my injury! My wound is incurable. But I said, “Truly this is a sickness, And I must bear it.”"
Jeremiah,10,20,"My tent is destroyed, And all my ropes are broken; My sons have gone from me and are no more. There is no one to stretch out my tent again Or to set up my curtains."
Jeremiah,10,21,"For the shepherds have become stupid And have not sought the L ord; Therefore they have not prospered, And all their flock is scattered."
Jeremiah,10,22,"The sound of a report! Behold, it comes— A great commotion out of the land of the north— To make the cities of Judah A desolation, a haunt of jackals."
Jeremiah,10,23,"I know, O L ord , that a man’s way is not in himself, Nor is it in a man who walks to direct his steps."
Jeremiah,10,24,"Correct me, O L ord , but with justice; Not with Your anger, or You will bring me to nothing."
Jeremiah,10,25,Pour out Your wrath on the nations that do not know You And on the families that do not call Your name; For they have devoured Jacob; They have devoured him and consumed him And have laid waste his habitation.
Jeremiah,11,1,"The word which came to Jeremiah from the L ord , saying,"
Jeremiah,11,2,"“Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;"
Jeremiah,11,3,"and say to them, ‘Thus says the L ord , the God of Israel, “Cursed is the man who does not heed the words of this covenant"
Jeremiah,11,4,"which I commanded your forefathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, ‘Listen to My voice, and do according to all which I command you; so you shall be My people, and I will be your God,’"
Jeremiah,11,5,"in order to confirm the oath which I swore to your forefathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day.” ’ ” Then I said, “Amen, O L ord .”"
Jeremiah,11,6,"And the L ord said to me, “Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, ‘Hear the words of this covenant and do them."
Jeremiah,11,7,"For I solemnly warned your fathers in the day that I brought them up from the land of Egypt, even to this day, warning persistently, saying, “Listen to My voice.”"
Jeremiah,11,8,"Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but walked, each one, in the stubbornness of his evil heart; therefore I brought on them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did not.’ ”"
Jeremiah,11,9,"Then the L ord said to me, “A conspiracy has been found among the men of Judah and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,11,10,"They have turned back to the iniquities of their ancestors who refused to hear My words, and they have gone after other gods to serve them; the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken My covenant which I made with their fathers.”"
Jeremiah,11,11,"Therefore thus says the L ord , “Behold I am bringing disaster on them which they will not be able to escape; though they will cry to Me, yet I will not listen to them."
Jeremiah,11,12,"Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry to the gods to whom they burn incense, but they surely will not save them in the time of their disaster."
Jeremiah,11,13,"For your gods are as many as your cities, O Judah; and as many as the streets of Jerusalem are the altars you have set up to the shameful thing, altars to burn incense to Baal."
Jeremiah,11,14,"“Therefore do not pray for this people, nor lift up a cry or prayer for them; for I will not listen when they call to Me because of their disaster."
Jeremiah,11,15,"What right has My beloved in My house When she has done many vile deeds? Can the sacrificial flesh take away from you your disaster, So that you can rejoice?”"
Jeremiah,11,16,"The L ord called your name, “A green olive tree, beautiful in fruit and form”; With the noise of a great tumult He has kindled fire on it, And its branches are worthless."
Jeremiah,11,17,"The L ord of hosts, who planted you, has pronounced evil against you because of the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done to provoke Me by offering up sacrifices to Baal."
Jeremiah,11,18,"Moreover, the L ord made it known to me and I knew it; Then You showed me their deeds."
Jeremiah,11,19,"But I was like a gentle lamb led to the slaughter; And I did not know that they had devised plots against me, saying, “Let us destroy the tree with its fruit, And let us cut him off from the land of the living, That his name be remembered no more.”"
Jeremiah,11,20,"But, O L ord of hosts, who judges righteously, Who tries the feelings and the heart, Let me see Your vengeance on them, For to You have I committed my cause."
Jeremiah,11,21,"Therefore thus says the L ord concerning the men of Anathoth, who seek your life, saying, “Do not prophesy in the name of the L ord , so that you will not die at our hand”;"
Jeremiah,11,22,"therefore, thus says the L ord of hosts, “Behold, I am about to punish them! The young men will die by the sword, their sons and daughters will die by famine;"
Jeremiah,11,23,"and a remnant will not be left to them, for I will bring disaster on the men of Anathoth—the year of their punishment.”"
Jeremiah,12,1,"Righteous are You, O L ord , that I would plead my case with You; Indeed I would discuss matters of justice with You: Why has the way of the wicked prospered? Why are all those who deal in treachery at ease?"
Jeremiah,12,2,"You have planted them, they have also taken root; They grow, they have even produced fruit. You are near to their lips But far from their mind."
Jeremiah,12,3,"But You know me, O L ord; You see me; And You examine my heart’s attitude toward You. Drag them off like sheep for the slaughter And set them apart for a day of carnage!"
Jeremiah,12,4,"How long is the land to mourn And the vegetation of the countryside to wither? For the wickedness of those who dwell in it, Animals and birds have been snatched away, Because men have said, “He will not see our latter ending.”"
Jeremiah,12,5,"“If you have run with footmen and they have tired you out, Then how can you compete with horses? If you fall down in a land of peace, How will you do in the thicket of the Jordan?"
Jeremiah,12,6,"For even your brothers and the household of your father, Even they have dealt treacherously with you, Even they have cried aloud after you. Do not believe them, although they may say nice things to you.”"
Jeremiah,12,7,"“I have forsaken My house, I have abandoned My inheritance; I have given the beloved of My soul Into the hand of her enemies."
Jeremiah,12,8,My inheritance has become to Me Like a lion in the forest; She has roared against Me; Therefore I have come to hate her.
Jeremiah,12,9,"Is My inheritance like a speckled bird of prey to Me? Are the birds of prey against her on every side? Go, gather all the beasts of the field, Bring them to devour!"
Jeremiah,12,10,"Many shepherds have ruined My vineyard, They have trampled down My field; They have made My pleasant field A desolate wilderness."
Jeremiah,12,11,"It has been made a desolation, Desolate, it mourns before Me; The whole land has been made desolate, Because no man lays it to heart."
Jeremiah,12,12,"On all the bare heights in the wilderness Destroyers have come, For a sword of the L ord is devouring From one end of the land even to the other; There is no peace for anyone."
Jeremiah,12,13,"They have sown wheat and have reaped thorns, They have strained themselves to no profit. But be ashamed of your harvest Because of the fierce anger of the L ord .”"
Jeremiah,12,14,"Thus says the L ord concerning all My wicked neighbors who strike at the inheritance with which I have endowed My people Israel, “Behold I am about to uproot them from their land and will uproot the house of Judah from among them."
Jeremiah,12,15,"And it will come about that after I have uprooted them, I will again have compassion on them; and I will bring them back, each one to his inheritance and each one to his land."
Jeremiah,12,16,"Then if they will really learn the ways of My people, to swear by My name, ‘As the L ord lives,’ even as they taught My people to swear by Baal, they will be built up in the midst of My people."
Jeremiah,12,17,"But if they will not listen, then I will uproot that nation, uproot and destroy it,” declares the L ord."
Jeremiah,13,1,"Thus the L ord said to me, “Go and buy yourself a linen waistband and put it around your waist, but do not put it in water.”"
Jeremiah,13,2,So I bought the waistband in accordance with the word of the L ord and put it around my waist.
Jeremiah,13,3,"Then the word of the L ord came to me a second time, saying,"
Jeremiah,13,4,"“Take the waistband that you have bought, which is around your waist, and arise, go to the Euphrates and hide it there in a crevice of the rock.”"
Jeremiah,13,5,"So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as the L ord had commanded me."
Jeremiah,13,6,"After many days the L ord said to me, “Arise, go to the Euphrates and take from there the waistband which I commanded you to hide there.”"
Jeremiah,13,7,"Then I went to the Euphrates and dug, and I took the waistband from the place where I had hidden it; and lo, the waistband was ruined, it was totally worthless."
Jeremiah,13,8,"Then the word of the L ord came to me, saying,"
Jeremiah,13,9,"“Thus says the L ord , ‘Just so will I destroy the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,13,10,"This wicked people, who refuse to listen to My words, who walk in the stubbornness of their hearts and have gone after other gods to serve them and to bow down to them, let them be just like this waistband which is totally worthless."
Jeremiah,13,11,"For as the waistband clings to the waist of a man, so I made the whole household of Israel and the whole household of Judah cling to Me,’ declares the L ord , ‘that they might be for Me a people, for renown, for praise and for glory; but they did not listen.’"
Jeremiah,13,12,"“Therefore you are to speak this word to them, ‘Thus says the L ord , the God of Israel, “Every jug is to be filled with wine.” ’ And when they say to you, ‘Do we not very well know that every jug is to be filled with wine?’"
Jeremiah,13,13,"then say to them, ‘Thus says the L ord , “Behold I am about to fill all the inhabitants of this land—the kings that sit for David on his throne, the priests, the prophets and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem—with drunkenness!"
Jeremiah,13,14,"I will dash them against each other, both the fathers and the sons together,” declares the L ord . “I will not show pity nor be sorry nor have compassion so as not to destroy them.” ’ ”"
Jeremiah,13,15,"Listen and give heed, do not be haughty, For the L ord has spoken."
Jeremiah,13,16,"Give glory to the L ord your God, Before He brings darkness And before your feet stumble On the dusky mountains, And while you are hoping for light He makes it into deep darkness, And turns it into gloom."
Jeremiah,13,17,"But if you will not listen to it, My soul will sob in secret for such pride; And my eyes will bitterly weep And flow down with tears, Because the flock of the L ord has been taken captive."
Jeremiah,13,18,"Say to the king and the queen mother, “Take a lowly seat, For your beautiful crown Has come down from your head.”"
Jeremiah,13,19,"The cities of the Negev have been locked up, And there is no one to open them; All Judah has been carried into exile, Wholly carried into exile."
Jeremiah,13,20,"“Lift up your eyes and see Those coming from the north. Where is the flock that was given you, Your beautiful sheep?"
Jeremiah,13,21,What will you say when He appoints over you— And you yourself had taught them— Former companions to be head over you? Will not pangs take hold of you Like a woman in childbirth?
Jeremiah,13,22,"If you say in your heart, ‘Why have these things happened to me?’ Because of the magnitude of your iniquity Your skirts have been removed And your heels have been exposed."
Jeremiah,13,23,Can the Ethiopian change his skin Or the leopard his spots? Then you also can do good Who are accustomed to doing evil.
Jeremiah,13,24,Therefore I will scatter them like drifting straw To the desert wind.
Jeremiah,13,25,"This is your lot, the portion measured to you From Me,” declares the L ord, “Because you have forgotten Me And trusted in falsehood."
Jeremiah,13,26,"So I Myself have also stripped your skirts off over your face, That your shame may be seen."
Jeremiah,13,27,"As for your adulteries and your lustful neighings, The lewdness of your prostitution On the hills in the field, I have seen your abominations. Woe to you, O Jerusalem! How long will you remain unclean?”"
Jeremiah,14,1,That which came as the word of the L ord to Jeremiah in regard to the drought:
Jeremiah,14,2,"“Judah mourns And her gates languish; They sit on the ground in mourning, And the cry of Jerusalem has ascended."
Jeremiah,14,3,"Their nobles have sent their servants for water; They have come to the cisterns and found no water. They have returned with their vessels empty; They have been put to shame and humiliated, And they cover their heads."
Jeremiah,14,4,"Because the ground is cracked, For there has been no rain on the land; The farmers have been put to shame, They have covered their heads."
Jeremiah,14,5,"For even the doe in the field has given birth only to abandon her young, Because there is no grass."
Jeremiah,14,6,"The wild donkeys stand on the bare heights; They pant for air like jackals, Their eyes fail For there is no vegetation."
Jeremiah,14,7,"Although our iniquities testify against us, O L ord , act for Your name’s sake! Truly our apostasies have been many, We have sinned against You."
Jeremiah,14,8,"O Hope of Israel, Its Savior in time of distress, Why are You like a stranger in the land Or like a traveler who has pitched his tent for the night?"
Jeremiah,14,9,"Why are You like a man dismayed, Like a mighty man who cannot save? Yet You are in our midst, O L ord, And we are called by Your name; Do not forsake us!”"
Jeremiah,14,10,"Thus says the L ord to this people, “Even so they have loved to wander; they have not kept their feet in check. Therefore the L ord does not accept them; now He will remember their iniquity and call their sins to account.”"
Jeremiah,14,11,"So the L ord said to me, “Do not pray for the welfare of this people."
Jeremiah,14,12,"When they fast, I am not going to listen to their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and grain offering, I am not going to accept them. Rather I am going to make an end of them by the sword, famine and pestilence.”"
Jeremiah,14,13,"But, “Ah, Lord G od !” I said, “Look, the prophets are telling them, ‘You will not see the sword nor will you have famine, but I will give you lasting peace in this place.’ ”"
Jeremiah,14,14,"Then the L ord said to me, “The prophets are prophesying falsehood in My name. I have neither sent them nor commanded them nor spoken to them; they are prophesying to you a false vision, divination, futility and the deception of their own minds."
Jeremiah,14,15,"Therefore thus says the L ord concerning the prophets who are prophesying in My name, although it was not I who sent them—yet they keep saying, ‘There will be no sword or famine in this land’—by sword and famine those prophets shall meet their end!"
Jeremiah,14,16,"The people also to whom they are prophesying will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and there will be no one to bury them— neither them, nor their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters—for I will pour out their own wickedness on them."
Jeremiah,14,17,"You will say this word to them, ‘Let my eyes flow down with tears night and day, And let them not cease; For the virgin daughter of my people has been crushed with a mighty blow, With a sorely infected wound."
Jeremiah,14,18,"If I go out to the country, Behold, those slain with the sword! Or if I enter the city, Behold, diseases of famine! For both prophet and priest Have gone roving about in the land that they do not know.’ ”"
Jeremiah,14,19,"Have You completely rejected Judah? Or have You loathed Zion? Why have You stricken us so that we are beyond healing? We waited for peace, but nothing good came; And for a time of healing, but behold, terror!"
Jeremiah,14,20,"We know our wickedness, O L ord, The iniquity of our fathers, for we have sinned against You."

Jeremiah,18,10,"if it does evil in My sight by not obeying My voice, then I will think better of the good with which I had promised to bless it."
Jeremiah,18,11,"So now then, speak to the men of Judah and against the inhabitants of Jerusalem saying, ‘Thus says the L ord , “Behold, I am fashioning calamity against you and devising a plan against you. Oh turn back, each of you from his evil way, and reform your ways and your deeds.” ’"

Jeremiah,18,18,"Then they said, “Come and let us devise plans against Jeremiah. Surely the law is not going to be lost to the priest, nor counsel to the sage, nor the divine word to the prophet! Come on and let us strike at him with our tongue, and let us give no heed to any of his words.”"

Jeremiah,19,3,"and say, ‘Hear the word of the L ord , O kings of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: thus says the L ord of hosts, the God of Israel, “Behold I am about to bring a calamity upon this place, at which the ears of everyone that hears of it will tingle."
Jeremiah,19,4,"Because they have forsaken Me and have made this an alien place and have burned sacrifices in it to other gods, that neither they nor their forefathers nor the kings of Judah had ever known, and because they have filled this place with the blood of the innocent"
Jeremiah,19,5,"and have built the high places of Baal to burn their sons in the fire as burnt offerings to Baal, a thing which I never commanded or spoke of, nor did it ever enter My mind;"
Jeremiah,19,6,"therefore, behold, days are coming,” declares the L ord , “when this place will no longer be called Topheth or the valley of Ben-hinnom, but rather the valley of Slaughter."
Jeremiah,19,7,"I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place, and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies and by the hand of those who seek their life; and I will give over their carcasses as food for the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth."

Jeremiah,19,11,"and say to them, ‘Thus says the L ord of hosts, “Just so will I break this people and this city, even as one breaks a potter’s vessel, which cannot again be repaired; and they will bury in Topheth because there is no other place for burial."
Jeremiah,19,12,"This is how I will treat this place and its inhabitants,” declares the L ord , “so as to make this city like Topheth."
Jeremiah,19,13,"The houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah will be defiled like the place Topheth, because of all the houses on whose rooftops they burned sacrifices to all the heavenly host and poured out drink offerings to other gods.” ’ ”"
Jeremiah,19,14,"Then Jeremiah came from Topheth, where the L ord had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of the L ord ’ s house and said to all the people:"
Jeremiah,19,15,"“Thus says the L ord of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘Behold, I am about to bring on this city and all its towns the entire calamity that I have declared against it, because they have stiffened their necks so as not to heed My words.’ ”"
Jeremiah,20,1,"When Pashhur the priest, the son of Immer, who was chief officer in the house of the L ord , heard Jeremiah prophesying these things,"
Jeremiah,20,2,"Pashhur had Jeremiah the prophet beaten and put him in the stocks that were at the upper Benjamin Gate, which was by the house of the L ord."
Jeremiah,20,3,"On the next day, when Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks, Jeremiah said to him, “Pashhur is not the name the L ord has called you, but rather Magor-missabib."
Jeremiah,20,4,"For thus says the L ord , ‘Behold, I am going to make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends; and while your eyes look on, they will fall by the sword of their enemies. So I will give over all Judah to the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will carry them away as exiles to Babylon and will slay them with the sword."
Jeremiah,20,5,"I will also give over all the wealth of this city, all its produce and all its costly things; even all the treasures of the kings of Judah I will give over to the hand of their enemies, and they will plunder them, take them away and bring them to Babylon."
Jeremiah,20,6,"And you, Pashhur, and all who live in your house will go into captivity; and you will enter Babylon, and there you will die and there you will be buried, you and all your friends to whom you have falsely prophesied.’ ”"
Jeremiah,20,7,"O L ord , You have deceived me and I was deceived; You have overcome me and prevailed. I have become a laughingstock all day long; Everyone mocks me."
Jeremiah,20,8,"For each time I speak, I cry aloud; I proclaim violence and destruction, Because for me the word of the L ord has resulted In reproach and derision all day long."
Jeremiah,20,9,"But if I say, “I will not remember Him Or speak anymore in His name,” Then in my heart it becomes like a burning fire Shut up in my bones; And I am weary of holding it in, And I cannot endure it."
Jeremiah,20,10,"For I have heard the whispering of many, “Terror on every side! Denounce him; yes, let us denounce him!” All my trusted friends, Watching for my fall, say: “Perhaps he will be deceived, so that we may prevail against him And take our revenge on him.”"
Jeremiah,20,11,"But the L ord is with me like a dread champion; Therefore my persecutors will stumble and not prevail. They will be utterly ashamed, because they have failed, With an everlasting disgrace that will not be forgotten."
Jeremiah,20,12,"Yet, O L ord of hosts, You who test the righteous, Who see the mind and the heart; Let me see Your vengeance on them; For to You I have set forth my cause."
Jeremiah,20,13,"Sing to the L ord , praise the L ord! For He has delivered the soul of the needy one From the hand of evildoers."
Jeremiah,20,14,Cursed be the day when I was born; Let the day not be blessed when my mother bore me!
Jeremiah,20,15,"Cursed be the man who brought the news To my father, saying, “A baby boy has been born to you!” And made him very happy."
Jeremiah,20,16,"But let that man be like the cities Which the L ord overthrew without relenting, And let him hear an outcry in the morning And a shout of alarm at noon;"
Jeremiah,20,17,"Because he did not kill me before birth, So that my mother would have been my grave, And her womb ever pregnant."
Jeremiah,20,18,"Why did I ever come forth from the womb To look on trouble and sorrow, So that my days have been spent in shame?"
Jeremiah,21,1,"The word which came to Jeremiah from the L ord when King Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur the son of Malchijah, and Zephaniah the priest, the son of Maaseiah, saying,"
Jeremiah,21,2,"“Please inquire of the L ord on our behalf, for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is warring against us; perhaps the L ord will deal with us according to all His wonderful acts, so that the enemy will withdraw from us.”"
Jeremiah,21,3,"Then Jeremiah said to them, “You shall say to Zedekiah as follows:"
Jeremiah,21,4,"‘Thus says the L ord God of Israel, “Behold, I am about to turn back the weapons of war which are in your hands, with which you are warring against the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans who are besieging you outside the wall; and I will gather them into the center of this city."
Jeremiah,21,5,"I Myself will war against you with an outstretched hand and a mighty arm, even in anger and wrath and great indignation."
Jeremiah,21,6,"I will also strike down the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast; they will die of a great pestilence."
Jeremiah,21,7,"Then afterwards,” declares the L ord , “I will give over Zedekiah king of Judah and his servants and the people, even those who survive in this city from the pestilence, the sword and the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their foes and into the hand of those who seek their lives; and he will strike them down with the edge of the sword. He will not spare them nor have pity nor compassion.” ’"
Jeremiah,21,8,"“You shall also say to this people, ‘Thus says the L ord , “Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death."
Jeremiah,21,9,"He who dwells in this city will die by the sword and by famine and by pestilence; but he who goes out and falls away to the Chaldeans who are besieging you will live, and he will have his own life as booty."
Jeremiah,21,10,"For I have set My face against this city for harm and not for good,” declares the L ord . “It will be given into the hand of the king of Babylon and he will burn it with fire.” ’"
Jeremiah,21,11,"“Then say to the household of the king of Judah, ‘Hear the word of the L ord,"
Jeremiah,21,12,"O house of David, thus says the L ord: “Administer justice every morning; And deliver the person who has been robbed from the power of his oppressor, That My wrath may not go forth like fire And burn with none to extinguish it, Because of the evil of their deeds."
Jeremiah,21,13,"“Behold, I am against you, O valley dweller, O rocky plain,” declares the L ord, “You men who say, ‘Who will come down against us? Or who will enter into our habitations?’"
Jeremiah,21,14,"But I will punish you according to the results of your deeds,” declares the L ord, “And I will kindle a fire in its forest That it may devour all its environs.” ’ ”"
Jeremiah,22,1,"Thus says the L ord , “Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and there speak this word"
Jeremiah,22,2,"and say, ‘Hear the word of the L ord , O king of Judah, who sits on David’s throne, you and your servants and your people who enter these gates."
Jeremiah,22,3,"Thus says the L ord , “Do justice and righteousness, and deliver the one who has been robbed from the power of his oppressor. Also do not mistreat or do violence to the stranger, the orphan, or the widow; and do not shed innocent blood in this place."
Jeremiah,22,4,"For if you men will indeed perform this thing, then kings will enter the gates of this house, sitting in David’s place on his throne, riding in chariots and on horses, even the king himself and his servants and his people."
Jeremiah,22,5,"But if you will not obey these words, I swear by Myself,” declares the L ord , “that this house will become a desolation.” ’ ”"
Jeremiah,22,6,"For thus says the L ord concerning the house of the king of Judah: “You are like Gilead to Me, Like the summit of Lebanon; Yet most assuredly I will make you like a wilderness, Like cities which are not inhabited."
Jeremiah,22,7,"For I will set apart destroyers against you, Each with his weapons; And they will cut down your choicest cedars And throw them on the fire."
Jeremiah,22,8,"“Many nations will pass by this city; and they will say to one another, ‘Why has the L ord done thus to this great city?’"
Jeremiah,22,9,"Then they will answer, ‘Because they forsook the covenant of the L ord their God and bowed down to other gods and served them.’ ”"
Jeremiah,22,10,"Do not weep for the dead or mourn for him, But weep continually for the one who goes away; For he will never return Or see his native land."
Jeremiah,22,11,"For thus says the L ord in regard to Shallum the son of Josiah, king of Judah, who became king in the place of Josiah his father, who went forth from this place, “He will never return there;"
Jeremiah,22,12,"but in the place where they led him captive, there he will die and not see this land again."
Jeremiah,22,13,"“Woe to him who builds his house without righteousness And his upper rooms without justice, Who uses his neighbor’s services without pay And does not give him his wages,"
Jeremiah,22,14,"Who says, ‘I will build myself a roomy house With spacious upper rooms, And cut out its windows, Paneling it with cedar and painting it bright red.’"
Jeremiah,22,15,Do you become a king because you are competing in cedar? Did not your father eat and drink And do justice and righteousness? Then it was well with him.
Jeremiah,22,16,He pled the cause of the afflicted and needy; Then it was well. Is not that what it means to know Me?” Declares the L ord.
Jeremiah,22,17,"“But your eyes and your heart Are intent only upon your own dishonest gain, And on shedding innocent blood And on practicing oppression and extortion.”"
Jeremiah,22,18,"Therefore thus says the L ord in regard to Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, “They will not lament for him: ‘Alas, my brother!’ or, ‘Alas, sister!’ They will not lament for him: ‘Alas for the master!’ or, ‘Alas for his splendor!’"
Jeremiah,22,19,"He will be buried with a donkey’s burial, Dragged off and thrown out beyond the gates of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,22,20,"Go up to Lebanon and cry out, And lift up your voice in Bashan; Cry out also from Abarim, For all your lovers have been crushed."
Jeremiah,22,21,"I spoke to you in your prosperity; But you said, ‘I will not listen!’ This has been your practice from your youth, That you have not obeyed My voice."
Jeremiah,22,22,"The wind will sweep away all your shepherds, And your lovers will go into captivity; Then you will surely be ashamed and humiliated Because of all your wickedness."
Jeremiah,22,23,"You who dwell in Lebanon, Nested in the cedars, How you will groan when pangs come upon you, Pain like a woman in childbirth!"
Jeremiah,22,24,"“As I live,” declares the L ord , “even though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were a signet ring on My right hand, yet I would pull you off;"
Jeremiah,22,25,"and I will give you over into the hand of those who are seeking your life, yes, into the hand of those whom you dread, even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and into the hand of the Chaldeans."
Jeremiah,22,26,"I will hurl you and your mother who bore you into another country where you were not born, and there you will die."
Jeremiah,22,27,"But as for the land to which they desire to return, they will not return to it."
Jeremiah,22,28,"Is this man Coniah a despised, shattered jar? Or is he an undesirable vessel? Why have he and his descendants been hurled out And cast into a land that they had not known?"
Jeremiah,22,29,"O land, land, land, Hear the word of the L ord!"
Jeremiah,22,30,"Thus says the L ord, ‘Write this man down childless, A man who will not prosper in his days; For no man of his descendants will prosper Sitting on the throne of David Or ruling again in Judah.’ ”"
Jeremiah,23,1,“Woe to the shepherds who are destroying and scattering the sheep of My pasture!” declares the L ord.
Jeremiah,23,2,"Therefore thus says the L ord God of Israel concerning the shepherds who are tending My people: “You have scattered My flock and driven them away, and have not attended to them; behold, I am about to attend to you for the evil of your deeds,” declares the L ord."
Jeremiah,23,3,"“Then I Myself will gather the remnant of My flock out of all the countries where I have driven them and bring them back to their pasture, and they will be fruitful and multiply."
Jeremiah,23,4,"I will also raise up shepherds over them and they will tend them; and they will not be afraid any longer, nor be terrified, nor will any be missing,” declares the L ord."
Jeremiah,23,5,"“Behold, the days are coming,” declares the L ord, “When I will raise up for David a righteous Branch; And He will reign as king and act wisely And do justice and righteousness in the land."
Jeremiah,23,6,"In His days Judah will be saved, And Israel will dwell securely; And this is His name by which He will be called, ‘The L ord our righteousness.’"
Jeremiah,23,7,"“Therefore behold, the days are coming,” declares the L ord , “when they will no longer say, ‘As the L ord lives, who brought up the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt,’"
Jeremiah,23,8,"but, ‘As the L ord lives, who brought up and led back the descendants of the household of Israel from the north land and from all the countries where I had driven them.’ Then they will live on their own soil.”"
Jeremiah,23,9,"As for the prophets: My heart is broken within me, All my bones tremble; I have become like a drunken man, Even like a man overcome with wine, Because of the L ord And because of His holy words."
Jeremiah,23,10,For the land is full of adulterers; For the land mourns because of the curse. The pastures of the wilderness have dried up. Their course also is evil And their might is not right.
Jeremiah,23,11,"“For both prophet and priest are polluted; Even in My house I have found their wickedness,” declares the L ord."
Jeremiah,23,12,"“Therefore their way will be like slippery paths to them, They will be driven away into the gloom and fall down in it; For I will bring calamity upon them, The year of their punishment,” declares the L ord."
Jeremiah,23,13,"“Moreover, among the prophets of Samaria I saw an offensive thing: They prophesied by Baal and led My people Israel astray."
Jeremiah,23,14,"Also among the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a horrible thing: The committing of adultery and walking in falsehood; And they strengthen the hands of evildoers, So that no one has turned back from his wickedness. All of them have become to Me like Sodom, And her inhabitants like Gomorrah."
Jeremiah,23,15,"Therefore thus says the L ord of hosts concerning the prophets, ‘Behold, I am going to feed them wormwood And make them drink poisonous water, For from the prophets of Jerusalem Pollution has gone forth into all the land.’ ”"
Jeremiah,23,16,"Thus says the L ord of hosts, “Do not listen to the words of the prophets who are prophesying to you. They are leading you into futility; They speak a vision of their own imagination, Not from the mouth of the L ord."
Jeremiah,23,17,"They keep saying to those who despise Me, ‘The L ord has said, “You will have peace” ’; And as for everyone who walks in the stubbornness of his own heart, They say, ‘Calamity will not come upon you.’"
Jeremiah,23,18,"But who has stood in the council of the L ord, That he should see and hear His word? Who has given heed to His word and listened?"
Jeremiah,23,19,"Behold, the storm of the L ord has gone forth in wrath, Even a whirling tempest; It will swirl down on the head of the wicked."
Jeremiah,23,20,The anger of the L ord will not turn back Until He has performed and carried out the purposes of His heart; In the last days you will clearly understand it.
Jeremiah,23,21,"I did not send these prophets, But they ran. I did not speak to them, But they prophesied."
Jeremiah,23,22,"But if they had stood in My council, Then they would have announced My words to My people, And would have turned them back from their evil way And from the evil of their deeds."
Jeremiah,23,23,"“Am I a God who is near,” declares the L ord, “And not a God far off?"
Jeremiah,23,24,Can a man hide himself in hiding places So I do not see him?” declares the L ord. “Do I not fill the heavens and the earth?” declares the L ord.
Jeremiah,23,25,"“I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy falsely in My name, saying, ‘I had a dream, I had a dream!’"
Jeremiah,23,26,"How long? Is there anything in the hearts of the prophets who prophesy falsehood, even these prophets of the deception of their own heart,"
Jeremiah,23,27,"who intend to make My people forget My name by their dreams which they relate to one another, just as their fathers forgot My name because of Baal?"
Jeremiah,23,28,"The prophet who has a dream may relate his dream, but let him who has My word speak My word in truth. What does straw have in common with grain?” declares the L ord."
Jeremiah,23,29,"“Is not My word like fire?” declares the L ord , “and like a hammer which shatters a rock?"
Jeremiah,23,30,"Therefore behold, I am against the prophets,” declares the L ord , “who steal My words from each other."
Jeremiah,23,31,"Behold, I am against the prophets,” declares the L ord , “who use their tongues and declare, ‘ The Lord declares.’"
Jeremiah,23,32,"Behold, I am against those who have prophesied false dreams,” declares the L ord , “and related them and led My people astray by their falsehoods and reckless boasting; yet I did not send them or command them, nor do they furnish this people the slightest benefit,” declares the L ord."
Jeremiah,23,33,"“Now when this people or the prophet or a priest asks you saying, ‘What is the oracle of the L ord ?’ then you shall say to them, ‘What oracle?’ The L ord declares, ‘I will abandon you.’"
Jeremiah,23,34,"Then as for the prophet or the priest or the people who say, ‘The oracle of the L ord ,’ I will bring punishment upon that man and his household."
Jeremiah,23,35,"Thus will each of you say to his neighbor and to his brother, ‘What has the L ord answered?’ or, ‘What has the L ord spoken?’"
Jeremiah,23,36,"For you will no longer remember the oracle of the L ord , because every man’s own word will become the oracle, and you have perverted the words of the living God, the L ord of hosts, our God."
Jeremiah,23,37,"Thus you will say to that prophet, ‘What has the L ord answered you?’ and, ‘What has the L ord spoken?’"
Jeremiah,23,38,"For if you say, ‘The oracle of the L ord !’ surely thus says the L ord , ‘Because you said this word, “The oracle of the L ord !” I have also sent to you, saying, “You shall not say, ‘The oracle of the L ord !’ ” ’"
Jeremiah,23,39,"Therefore behold, I will surely forget you and cast you away from My presence, along with the city which I gave you and your fathers."
Jeremiah,23,40,I will put an everlasting reproach on you and an everlasting humiliation which will not be forgotten.”
Jeremiah,24,1,"After Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the officials of Judah with the craftsmen and smiths from Jerusalem and had brought them to Babylon, the L ord showed me: behold, two baskets of figs set before the temple of the L ord!"
Jeremiah,24,2,"One basket had very good figs, like first-ripe figs, and the other basket had very bad figs which could not be eaten due to rottenness."
Jeremiah,24,3,"Then the L ord said to me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?” And I said, “Figs, the good figs, very good; and the bad figs, very bad, which cannot be eaten due to rottenness.”"
Jeremiah,24,4,"Then the word of the L ord came to me, saying,"
Jeremiah,24,5,"“Thus says the L ord God of Israel, ‘Like these good figs, so I will regard as good the captives of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans."
Jeremiah,24,6,"For I will set My eyes on them for good, and I will bring them again to this land; and I will build them up and not overthrow them, and I will plant them and not pluck them up."
Jeremiah,24,7,"I will give them a heart to know Me, for I am the L ord ; and they will be My people, and I will be their God, for they will return to Me with their whole heart."
Jeremiah,24,8,"‘But like the bad figs which cannot be eaten due to rottenness—indeed, thus says the L ord —so I will abandon Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials, and the remnant of Jerusalem who remain in this land and the ones who dwell in the land of Egypt."
Jeremiah,24,9,"I will make them a terror and an evil for all the kingdoms of the earth, as a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse in all places where I will scatter them."
Jeremiah,24,10,"I will send the sword, the famine and the pestilence upon them until they are destroyed from the land which I gave to them and their forefathers.’ ”"
Jeremiah,25,1,"The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah (that was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon),"
Jeremiah,25,2,"which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying,"
Jeremiah,25,3,"“From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, even to this day, these twenty-three years the word of the L ord has come to me, and I have spoken to you again and again, but you have not listened."
Jeremiah,25,4,"And the L ord has sent to you all His servants the prophets again and again, but you have not listened nor inclined your ear to hear,"
Jeremiah,25,5,"saying, ‘Turn now everyone from his evil way and from the evil of your deeds, and dwell on the land which the L ord has given to you and your forefathers forever and ever;"
Jeremiah,25,6,"and do not go after other gods to serve them and to worship them, and do not provoke Me to anger with the work of your hands, and I will do you no harm.’"
Jeremiah,25,7,"Yet you have not listened to Me,” declares the L ord , “in order that you might provoke Me to anger with the work of your hands to your own harm."
Jeremiah,25,8,"“Therefore thus says the L ord of hosts, ‘Because you have not obeyed My words,"
Jeremiah,25,9,"behold, I will send and take all the families of the north,’ declares the L ord , ‘and I will send to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, My servant, and will bring them against this land and against its inhabitants and against all these nations round about; and I will utterly destroy them and make them a horror and a hissing, and an everlasting desolation."
Jeremiah,25,10,"Moreover, I will take from them the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones and the light of the lamp."
Jeremiah,25,11,"This whole land will be a desolation and a horror, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon seventy years."
Jeremiah,25,12,"‘Then it will be when seventy years are completed I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation,’ declares the L ord , ‘for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans; and I will make it an everlasting desolation."
Jeremiah,25,13,"I will bring upon that land all My words which I have pronounced against it, all that is written in this book which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations."
Jeremiah,25,14,"(For many nations and great kings will make slaves of them, even them; and I will recompense them according to their deeds and according to the work of their hands.)’ ”"
Jeremiah,25,15,"For thus the L ord , the God of Israel, says to me, “Take this cup of the wine of wrath from My hand and cause all the nations to whom I send you to drink it."
Jeremiah,25,16,They will drink and stagger and go mad because of the sword that I will send among them.”
Jeremiah,25,17,Then I took the cup from the L ord ’ s hand and made all the nations to whom the L ord sent me drink it:
Jeremiah,25,18,"Jerusalem and the cities of Judah and its kings and its princes, to make them a ruin, a horror, a hissing and a curse, as it is this day;"
Jeremiah,25,19,"Pharaoh king of Egypt, his servants, his princes and all his people;"
Jeremiah,25,20,"and all the foreign people, all the kings of the land of Uz, all the kings of the land of the Philistines (even Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron and the remnant of Ashdod);"
Jeremiah,25,21,"Edom, Moab and the sons of Ammon;"
Jeremiah,25,22,"and all the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon and the kings of the coastlands which are beyond the sea;"
Jeremiah,25,23,"and Dedan, Tema, Buz and all who cut the corners of their hair;"
Jeremiah,25,24,and all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the foreign people who dwell in the desert;
Jeremiah,25,25,"and all the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam and all the kings of Media;"
Jeremiah,25,26,"and all the kings of the north, near and far, one with another; and all the kingdoms of the earth which are upon the face of the ground, and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them."
Jeremiah,25,27,"“You shall say to them, ‘Thus says the L ord of hosts, the God of Israel, “Drink, be drunk, vomit, fall and rise no more because of the sword which I will send among you.” ’"
Jeremiah,25,28,"And it will be, if they refuse to take the cup from your hand to drink, then you will say to them, ‘Thus says the L ord of hosts: “You shall surely drink!"
Jeremiah,25,29,"For behold, I am beginning to work calamity in this city which is called by My name, and shall you be completely free from punishment? You will not be free from punishment; for I am summoning a sword against all the inhabitants of the earth,” declares the L ord of hosts.’"
Jeremiah,25,30,"“Therefore you shall prophesy against them all these words, and you shall say to them, ‘The L ord will roar from on high And utter His voice from His holy habitation; He will roar mightily against His fold. He will shout like those who tread the grapes, Against all the inhabitants of the earth."
Jeremiah,25,31,"A clamor has come to the end of the earth, Because the L ord has a controversy with the nations. He is entering into judgment with all flesh; As for the wicked, He has given them to the sword,’ declares the L ord .”"
Jeremiah,25,32,"Thus says the L ord of hosts, “Behold, evil is going forth From nation to nation, And a great storm is being stirred up From the remotest parts of the earth."
Jeremiah,25,33,"“Those slain by the L ord on that day will be from one end of the earth to the other. They will not be lamented, gathered or buried; they will be like dung on the face of the ground."
Jeremiah,25,34,"Wail, you shepherds, and cry; And wallow in ashes, you masters of the flock; For the days of your slaughter and your dispersions have come, And you will fall like a choice vessel."
Jeremiah,25,35,"Flight will perish from the shepherds, And escape from the masters of the flock."
Jeremiah,25,36," Hear the sound of the cry of the shepherds, And the wailing of the masters of the flock! For the L ord is destroying their pasture,"
Jeremiah,25,37,And the peaceful folds are made silent Because of the fierce anger of the L ord.
Jeremiah,25,38,He has left His hiding place like the lion; For their land has become a horror Because of the fierceness of the oppressing sword And because of His fierce anger.”
Jeremiah,26,1,"In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came from the L ord , saying,"
Jeremiah,26,2,"“Thus says the L ord , ‘Stand in the court of the L ord ’ s house, and speak to all the cities of Judah who have come to worship in the L ord ’ s house all the words that I have commanded you to speak to them. Do not omit a word!"
Jeremiah,26,3,"Perhaps they will listen and everyone will turn from his evil way, that I may repent of the calamity which I am planning to do to them because of the evil of their deeds.’"
Jeremiah,26,4,"And you will say to them, ‘Thus says the L ord , “If you will not listen to Me, to walk in My law which I have set before you,"
Jeremiah,26,5,"to listen to the words of My servants the prophets, whom I have been sending to you again and again, but you have not listened;"
Jeremiah,26,6,"then I will make this house like Shiloh, and this city I will make a curse to all the nations of the earth.” ’ ”"
Jeremiah,26,7,The priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the L ord.
Jeremiah,26,8,"When Jeremiah finished speaking all that the L ord had commanded him to speak to all the people, the priests and the prophets and all the people seized him, saying, “You must die!"
Jeremiah,26,9,"Why have you prophesied in the name of the L ord saying, ‘This house will be like Shiloh and this city will be desolate, without inhabitant’?” And all the people gathered about Jeremiah in the house of the L ord."
Jeremiah,26,10,"When the officials of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king’s house to the house of the L ord and sat in the entrance of the New Gate of the L ord ’ s house."
Jeremiah,26,11,"Then the priests and the prophets spoke to the officials and to all the people, saying, “A death sentence for this man! For he has prophesied against this city as you have heard in your hearing.”"
Jeremiah,26,12,"Then Jeremiah spoke to all the officials and to all the people, saying, “The L ord sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that you have heard."
Jeremiah,26,13,Now therefore amend your ways and your deeds and obey the voice of the L ord your God; and the L ord will change His mind about the misfortune which He has pronounced against you.
Jeremiah,26,14,"But as for me, behold, I am in your hands; do with me as is good and right in your sight."
Jeremiah,26,15,"Only know for certain that if you put me to death, you will bring innocent blood on yourselves, and on this city and on its inhabitants; for truly the L ord has sent me to you to speak all these words in your hearing.”"
Jeremiah,26,16,"Then the officials and all the people said to the priests and to the prophets, “No death sentence for this man! For he has spoken to us in the name of the L ord our God.”"
Jeremiah,26,17,"Then some of the elders of the land rose up and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying,"
Jeremiah,26,18,"“Micah of Moresheth prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah; and he spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, ‘Thus the L ord of hosts has said, “Zion will be plowed as a field, And Jerusalem will become ruins, And the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.” ’"
Jeremiah,26,19,"Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? Did he not fear the L ord and entreat the favor of the L ord , and the L ord changed His mind about the misfortune which He had pronounced against them? But we are committing a great evil against ourselves.”"
Jeremiah,26,20,"Indeed, there was also a man who prophesied in the name of the L ord , Uriah the son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-jearim; and he prophesied against this city and against this land words similar to all those of Jeremiah."
Jeremiah,26,21,"When King Jehoiakim and all his mighty men and all the officials heard his words, then the king sought to put him to death; but Uriah heard it, and he was afraid and fled and went to Egypt."
Jeremiah,26,22,Then King Jehoiakim sent men to Egypt: Elnathan the son of Achbor and certain men with him went into Egypt.
Jeremiah,26,23,"And they brought Uriah from Egypt and led him to King Jehoiakim, who slew him with a sword and cast his dead body into the burial place of the common people."
Jeremiah,26,24,"But the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, so that he was not given into the hands of the people to put him to death."
Jeremiah,27,1,"In the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the L ord , saying—"
Jeremiah,27,2,"thus says the L ord to me—“Make for yourself bonds and yokes and put them on your neck,"
Jeremiah,27,3,"and send word to the king of Edom, to the king of Moab, to the king of the sons of Ammon, to the king of Tyre and to the king of Sidon by the messengers who come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah."
Jeremiah,27,4,"Command them to go to their masters, saying, ‘Thus says the L ord of hosts, the God of Israel, thus you shall say to your masters,"
Jeremiah,27,5,"“I have made the earth, the men and the beasts which are on the face of the earth by My great power and by My outstretched arm, and I will give it to the one who is pleasing in My sight."
Jeremiah,27,6,"Now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, My servant, and I have given him also the wild animals of the field to serve him."
Jeremiah,27,7,All the nations shall serve him and his son and his grandson until the time of his own land comes; then many nations and great kings will make him their servant.
Jeremiah,27,8,"“It will be, that the nation or the kingdom which will not serve him, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and which will not put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, I will punish that nation with the sword, with famine and with pestilence,” declares the L ord , “until I have destroyed it by his hand."
Jeremiah,27,9,"But as for you, do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your dreamers, your soothsayers or your sorcerers who speak to you, saying, ‘You will not serve the king of Babylon.’"
Jeremiah,27,10,For they prophesy a lie to you in order to remove you far from your land; and I will drive you out and you will perish.
Jeremiah,27,11,"But the nation which will bring its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will let remain on its land,” declares the L ord , “and they will till it and dwell in it.” ’ ”"
Jeremiah,27,12,"I spoke words like all these to Zedekiah king of Judah, saying, “Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him and his people, and live!"
Jeremiah,27,13,"Why will you die, you and your people, by the sword, famine and pestilence, as the L ord has spoken to that nation which will not serve the king of Babylon?"
Jeremiah,27,14,"So do not listen to the words of the prophets who speak to you, saying, ‘You will not serve the king of Babylon,’ for they prophesy a lie to you;"
Jeremiah,27,15,"for I have not sent them,” declares the L ord , “but they prophesy falsely in My name, in order that I may drive you out and that you may perish, you and the prophets who prophesy to you.”"
Jeremiah,27,16," Then I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, “Thus says the L ord : Do not listen to the words of your prophets who prophesy to you, saying, ‘Behold, the vessels of the L ord ’ s house will now shortly be brought again from Babylon’; for they are prophesying a lie to you."
Jeremiah,27,17,"Do not listen to them; serve the king of Babylon, and live! Why should this city become a ruin?"
Jeremiah,27,18,"But if they are prophets, and if the word of the L ord is with them, let them now entreat the L ord of hosts that the vessels which are left in the house of the L ord , in the house of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem may not go to Babylon."
Jeremiah,27,19,"For thus says the L ord of hosts concerning the pillars, concerning the sea, concerning the stands and concerning the rest of the vessels that are left in this city,"
Jeremiah,27,20,"which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take when he carried into exile Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,27,21,"Yes, thus says the L ord of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that are left in the house of the L ord and in the house of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem,"
Jeremiah,27,22,"‘They will be carried to Babylon and they will be there until the day I visit them,’ declares the L ord . ‘Then I will bring them back and restore them to this place.’ ”"
Jeremiah,28,1,"Now in the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, Hananiah the son of Azzur, the prophet, who was from Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of the L ord in the presence of the priests and all the people, saying,"
Jeremiah,28,2,"“Thus says the L ord of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon."
Jeremiah,28,3,"Within two years I am going to bring back to this place all the vessels of the L ord ’ s house, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place and carried to Babylon."
Jeremiah,28,4,"I am also going to bring back to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and all the exiles of Judah who went to Babylon,’ declares the L ord , ‘for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.’ ”"
Jeremiah,28,5,"Then the prophet Jeremiah spoke to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests and in the presence of all the people who were standing in the house of the L ord,"
Jeremiah,28,6,"and the prophet Jeremiah said, “Amen! May the L ord do so; may the L ord confirm your words which you have prophesied to bring back the vessels of the L ord ’ s house and all the exiles, from Babylon to this place."
Jeremiah,28,7,Yet hear now this word which I am about to speak in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people!
Jeremiah,28,8,"The prophets who were before me and before you from ancient times prophesied against many lands and against great kingdoms, of war and of calamity and of pestilence."
Jeremiah,28,9,"The prophet who prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophet comes to pass, then that prophet will be known as one whom the L ord has truly sent.”"
Jeremiah,28,10,Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet and broke it.
Jeremiah,28,11,"Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, “Thus says the L ord , ‘Even so will I break within two full years the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all the nations.’ ” Then the prophet Jeremiah went his way."
Jeremiah,28,12,"The word of the L ord came to Jeremiah after Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah,28,13,"“Go and speak to Hananiah, saying, ‘Thus says the L ord , “You have broken the yokes of wood, but you have made instead of them yokes of iron.”"
Jeremiah,28,14,"For thus says the L ord of hosts, the God of Israel, “I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they will serve him. And I have also given him the beasts of the field.” ’ ”"
Jeremiah,28,15,"Then Jeremiah the prophet said to Hananiah the prophet, “Listen now, Hananiah, the L ord has not sent you, and you have made this people trust in a lie."
Jeremiah,28,16,"Therefore thus says the L ord , ‘Behold, I am about to remove you from the face of the earth. This year you are going to die, because you have counseled rebellion against the L ord .’ ”"
Jeremiah,28,17,So Hananiah the prophet died in the same year in the seventh month.
Jeremiah,29,1,"Now these are the words of the letter which Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the rest of the elders of the exile, the priests, the prophets and all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had taken into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon."
Jeremiah,29,2,"(This was after King Jeconiah and the queen mother, the court officials, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen and the smiths had departed from Jerusalem.)"
Jeremiah,29,3,"The letter was sent by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, saying,"
Jeremiah,29,4,"“Thus says the L ord of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the exiles whom I have sent into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon,"
Jeremiah,29,5,‘Build houses and live in them; and plant gardens and eat their produce.
Jeremiah,29,6,"Take wives and become the fathers of sons and daughters, and take wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; and multiply there and do not decrease."
Jeremiah,29,7,"Seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the L ord on its behalf; for in its welfare you will have welfare.’"
Jeremiah,29,8,"For thus says the L ord of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘Do not let your prophets who are in your midst and your diviners deceive you, and do not listen to the dreams which they dream."
Jeremiah,29,9,"For they prophesy falsely to you in My name; I have not sent them,’ declares the L ord."
Jeremiah,29,10,"“For thus says the L ord , ‘When seventy years have been completed for Babylon, I will visit you and fulfill My good word to you, to bring you back to this place."
Jeremiah,29,11,"For I know the plans that I have for you,’ declares the L ord , ‘plans for welfare and not for calamity to give you a future and a hope."
Jeremiah,29,12,"Then you will call upon Me and come and pray to Me, and I will listen to you."
Jeremiah,29,13,You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart.
Jeremiah,29,14,"I will be found by you,’ declares the L ord , ‘and I will restore your fortunes and will gather you from all the nations and from all the places where I have driven you,’ declares the L ord , ‘and I will bring you back to the place from where I sent you into exile.’"
Jeremiah,29,15,"“Because you have said, ‘The L ord has raised up prophets for us in Babylon’—"
Jeremiah,29,16,"for thus says the L ord concerning the king who sits on the throne of David, and concerning all the people who dwell in this city, your brothers who did not go with you into exile—"
Jeremiah,29,17,"thus says the L ord of hosts, ‘Behold, I am sending upon them the sword, famine and pestilence, and I will make them like split-open figs that cannot be eaten due to rottenness."
Jeremiah,29,18,"I will pursue them with the sword, with famine and with pestilence; and I will make them a terror to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse and a horror and a hissing, and a reproach among all the nations where I have driven them,"
Jeremiah,29,19,"because they have not listened to My words,’ declares the L ord , ‘which I sent to them again and again by My servants the prophets; but you did not listen,’ declares the L ord."
Jeremiah,29,20,"You, therefore, hear the word of the L ord , all you exiles, whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon."
Jeremiah,29,21,"“Thus says the L ord of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah and concerning Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who are prophesying to you falsely in My name, ‘Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will slay them before your eyes."
Jeremiah,29,22,"Because of them a curse will be used by all the exiles from Judah who are in Babylon, saying, “May the L ord make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire,"
Jeremiah,29,23,"because they have acted foolishly in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbors’ wives and have spoken words in My name falsely, which I did not command them; and I am He who knows and am a witness,” declares the L ord .’ ”"
Jeremiah,29,24,"To Shemaiah the Nehelamite you shall speak, saying,"
Jeremiah,29,25,"“Thus says the L ord of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘Because you have sent letters in your own name to all the people who are in Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, and to all the priests, saying,"
Jeremiah,29,26,"“The L ord has made you priest instead of Jehoiada the priest, to be the overseer in the house of the L ord over every madman who prophesies, to put him in the stocks and in the iron collar,"
Jeremiah,29,27,"now then, why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth who prophesies to you?"
Jeremiah,29,28,"For he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, ‘ The exile will be long; build houses and live in them and plant gardens and eat their produce.’ ” ’ ”"
Jeremiah,29,29,Zephaniah the priest read this letter to Jeremiah the prophet.
Jeremiah,29,30,"Then came the word of the L ord to Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah,29,31,"“Send to all the exiles, saying, ‘Thus says the L ord concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite, “Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, although I did not send him, and he has made you trust in a lie,”"
Jeremiah,29,32,"therefore thus says the L ord , “Behold, I am about to punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his descendants; he will not have anyone living among this people, and he will not see the good that I am about to do to My people,” declares the L ord , “because he has preached rebellion against the L ord .” ’ ”"
Jeremiah,30,1,"The word which came to Jeremiah from the L ord , saying,"
Jeremiah,30,2,"“Thus says the L ord , the God of Israel, ‘Write all the words which I have spoken to you in a book."
Jeremiah,30,3,"For behold, days are coming,’ declares the L ord , ‘when I will restore the fortunes of My people Israel and Judah.’ The L ord says, ‘I will also bring them back to the land that I gave to their forefathers and they shall possess it.’ ”"
Jeremiah,30,4,Now these are the words which the L ord spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah:
Jeremiah,30,5,"“For thus says the L ord, ‘I have heard a sound of terror, Of dread, and there is no peace."
Jeremiah,30,6,"Ask now, and see If a male can give birth. Why do I see every man With his hands on his loins, as a woman in childbirth? And why have all faces turned pale?"
Jeremiah,30,7,"Alas! for that day is great, There is none like it; And it is the time of Jacob’s distress, But he will be saved from it."
Jeremiah,30,8,"‘It shall come about on that day,’ declares the L ord of hosts, ‘that I will break his yoke from off their neck and will tear off their bonds; and strangers will no longer make them their slaves."
Jeremiah,30,9,"But they shall serve the L ord their God and David their king, whom I will raise up for them."
Jeremiah,30,10,"Fear not, O Jacob My servant,’ declares the L ord, ‘And do not be dismayed, O Israel; For behold, I will save you from afar And your offspring from the land of their captivity. And Jacob will return and will be quiet and at ease, And no one will make him afraid."
Jeremiah,30,11,"For I am with you,’ declares the L ord , ‘to save you; For I will destroy completely all the nations where I have scattered you, Only I will not destroy you completely. But I will chasten you justly And will by no means leave you unpunished.’"
Jeremiah,30,12,"“For thus says the L ord, ‘Your wound is incurable And your injury is serious."
Jeremiah,30,13,"There is no one to plead your cause; No healing for your sore, No recovery for you."
Jeremiah,30,14,"All your lovers have forgotten you, They do not seek you; For I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy, With the punishment of a cruel one, Because your iniquity is great And your sins are numerous."
Jeremiah,30,15,"Why do you cry out over your injury? Your pain is incurable. Because your iniquity is great And your sins are numerous, I have done these things to you."
Jeremiah,30,16,"Therefore all who devour you will be devoured; And all your adversaries, every one of them, will go into captivity; And those who plunder you will be for plunder, And all who prey upon you I will give for prey."
Jeremiah,30,17,"For I will restore you to health And I will heal you of your wounds,’ declares the L ord, ‘Because they have called you an outcast, saying: “It is Zion; no one cares for her.” ’"
Jeremiah,30,18,"“Thus says the L ord, ‘Behold, I will restore the fortunes of the tents of Jacob And have compassion on his dwelling places; And the city will be rebuilt on its ruin, And the palace will stand on its rightful place."
Jeremiah,30,19,From them will proceed thanksgiving And the voice of those who celebrate; And I will multiply them and they will not be diminished; I will also honor them and they will not be insignificant.
Jeremiah,30,20,"Their children also will be as formerly, And their congregation shall be established before Me; And I will punish all their oppressors."
Jeremiah,30,21,"Their leader shall be one of them, And their ruler shall come forth from their midst; And I will bring him near and he shall approach Me; For who would dare to risk his life to approach Me?’ declares the L ord."
Jeremiah,30,22,"‘You shall be My people, And I will be your God.’ ”"
Jeremiah,30,23,"Behold, the tempest of the L ord! Wrath has gone forth, A sweeping tempest; It will burst on the head of the wicked."
Jeremiah,30,24,The fierce anger of the L ord will not turn back Until He has performed and until He has accomplished The intent of His heart; In the latter days you will understand this.
Jeremiah,31,1,"“At that time,” declares the L ord , “I will be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be My people.”"
Jeremiah,31,2,"Thus says the L ord, “The people who survived the sword Found grace in the wilderness— Israel, when it went to find its rest.”"
Jeremiah,31,3,"The L ord appeared to him from afar, saying, “I have loved you with an everlasting love; Therefore I have drawn you with lovingkindness."
Jeremiah,31,4,"Again I will build you and you will be rebuilt, O virgin of Israel! Again you will take up your tambourines, And go forth to the dances of the merrymakers."
Jeremiah,31,5,Again you will plant vineyards On the hills of Samaria; The planters will plant And will enjoy them.
Jeremiah,31,6,"For there will be a day when watchmen On the hills of Ephraim call out, ‘Arise, and let us go up to Zion, To the L ord our God.’ ”"
Jeremiah,31,7,"For thus says the L ord, “Sing aloud with gladness for Jacob, And shout among the chief of the nations; Proclaim, give praise and say, ‘O L ord , save Your people, The remnant of Israel.’"
Jeremiah,31,8,"Behold, I am bringing them from the north country, And I will gather them from the remote parts of the earth, Among them the blind and the lame, The woman with child and she who is in labor with child, together; A great company, they will return here."
Jeremiah,31,9,"With weeping they will come, And by supplication I will lead them; I will make them walk by streams of waters, On a straight path in which they will not stumble; For I am a father to Israel, And Ephraim is My firstborn.”"
Jeremiah,31,10,"Hear the word of the L ord , O nations, And declare in the coastlands afar off, And say, “He who scattered Israel will gather him And keep him as a shepherd keeps his flock.”"
Jeremiah,31,11,For the L ord has ransomed Jacob And redeemed him from the hand of him who was stronger than he.
Jeremiah,31,12,"“They will come and shout for joy on the height of Zion, And they will be radiant over the bounty of the L ord — Over the grain and the new wine and the oil, And over the young of the flock and the herd; And their life will be like a watered garden, And they will never languish again."
Jeremiah,31,13,"Then the virgin will rejoice in the dance, And the young men and the old, together, For I will turn their mourning into joy And will comfort them and give them joy for their sorrow."
Jeremiah,31,14,"I will fill the soul of the priests with abundance, And My people will be satisfied with My goodness,” declares the L ord."
Jeremiah,31,15,"Thus says the L ord, “A voice is heard in Ramah, Lamentation and bitter weeping. Rachel is weeping for her children; She refuses to be comforted for her children, Because they are no more.”"
Jeremiah,31,16,"Thus says the L ord, “Restrain your voice from weeping And your eyes from tears; For your work will be rewarded,” declares the L ord, “And they will return from the land of the enemy."
Jeremiah,31,17,"There is hope for your future,” declares the L ord, “And your children will return to their own territory."
Jeremiah,31,18,"I have surely heard Ephraim grieving, ‘You have chastised me, and I was chastised, Like an untrained calf; Bring me back that I may be restored, For You are the L ord my God."
Jeremiah,31,19,"For after I turned back, I repented; And after I was instructed, I smote on my thigh; I was ashamed and also humiliated Because I bore the reproach of my youth.’"
Jeremiah,31,20,"Is Ephraim My dear son? Is he a delightful child? Indeed, as often as I have spoken against him, I certainly still remember him; Therefore My heart yearns for him; I will surely have mercy on him,” declares the L ord."
Jeremiah,31,21,"“Set up for yourself roadmarks, Place for yourself guideposts; Direct your mind to the highway, The way by which you went. Return, O virgin of Israel, Return to these your cities."
Jeremiah,31,22,"How long will you go here and there, O faithless daughter? For the L ord has created a new thing in the earth— A woman will encompass a man.”"
Jeremiah,31,23,"Thus says the L ord of hosts, the God of Israel, “Once again they will speak this word in the land of Judah and in its cities when I restore their fortunes, ‘The L ord bless you, O abode of righteousness, O holy hill!’"
Jeremiah,31,24,"Judah and all its cities will dwell together in it, the farmer and they who go about with flocks."
Jeremiah,31,25,For I satisfy the weary ones and refresh everyone who languishes.”
Jeremiah,31,26,"At this I awoke and looked, and my sleep was pleasant to me."
Jeremiah,31,27,"“Behold, days are coming,” declares the L ord , “when I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and with the seed of beast."
Jeremiah,31,28,"As I have watched over them to pluck up, to break down, to overthrow, to destroy and to bring disaster, so I will watch over them to build and to plant,” declares the L ord."
Jeremiah,31,29,"“In those days they will not say again, ‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes, And the children’s teeth are set on edge.’"
Jeremiah,31,30,"But everyone will die for his own iniquity; each man who eats the sour grapes, his teeth will be set on edge."
Jeremiah,31,31,"“Behold, days are coming,” declares the L ord , “when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah,"
Jeremiah,31,32,"not like the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, My covenant which they broke, although I was a husband to them,” declares the L ord."
Jeremiah,31,33,"“But this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days,” declares the L ord , “I will put My law within them and on their heart I will write it; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people."
Jeremiah,31,34,"They will not teach again, each man his neighbor and each man his brother, saying, ‘Know the L ord ,’ for they will all know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them,” declares the L ord , “for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more.”"
Jeremiah,31,35,"Thus says the L ord, Who gives the sun for light by day And the fixed order of the moon and the stars for light by night, Who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar; The L ord of hosts is His name:"
Jeremiah,31,36,"“If this fixed order departs From before Me,” declares the L ord, “Then the offspring of Israel also will cease From being a nation before Me forever.”"
Jeremiah,31,37,"Thus says the L ord, “If the heavens above can be measured And the foundations of the earth searched out below, Then I will also cast off all the offspring of Israel For all that they have done,” declares the L ord."
Jeremiah,31,38,"“Behold, days are coming,” declares the L ord , “when the city will be rebuilt for the L ord from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate."
Jeremiah,31,39,The measuring line will go out farther straight ahead to the hill Gareb; then it will turn to Goah.
Jeremiah,31,40,"And the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes, and all the fields as far as the brook Kidron, to the corner of the Horse Gate toward the east, shall be holy to the L ord ; it will not be plucked up or overthrown anymore forever.”"
Jeremiah,32,1,"The word that came to Jeremiah from the L ord in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar."
Jeremiah,32,2,"Now at that time the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the house of the king of Judah,"
Jeremiah,32,3,"because Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, “Why do you prophesy, saying, ‘Thus says the L ord , “Behold, I am about to give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will take it;"
Jeremiah,32,4,"and Zedekiah king of Judah will not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but he will surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will speak with him face to face and see him eye to eye;"
Jeremiah,32,5,"and he will take Zedekiah to Babylon, and he will be there until I visit him,” declares the L ord . “If you fight against the Chaldeans, you will not succeed” ’?”"
Jeremiah,32,6,"And Jeremiah said, “The word of the L ord came to me, saying,"
Jeremiah,32,7,"‘Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle is coming to you, saying, “Buy for yourself my field which is at Anathoth, for you have the right of redemption to buy it. ” ’"
Jeremiah,32,8,"Then Hanamel my uncle’s son came to me in the court of the guard according to the word of the L ord and said to me, ‘Buy my field, please, that is at Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin; for you have the right of possession and the redemption is yours; buy it for yourself.’ Then I knew that this was the word of the L ord."
Jeremiah,32,9,"“I bought the field which was at Anathoth from Hanamel my uncle’s son, and I weighed out the silver for him, seventeen shekels of silver."
Jeremiah,32,10,"I signed and sealed the deed, and called in witnesses, and weighed out the silver on the scales."
Jeremiah,32,11,"Then I took the deeds of purchase, both the sealed copy containing the terms and conditions and the open copy;"
Jeremiah,32,12,"and I gave the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the sight of Hanamel my uncle’s son and in the sight of the witnesses who signed the deed of purchase, before all the Jews who were sitting in the court of the guard."
Jeremiah,32,13,"And I commanded Baruch in their presence, saying,"
Jeremiah,32,14,"‘Thus says the L ord of hosts, the God of Israel, “Take these deeds, this sealed deed of purchase and this open deed, and put them in an earthenware jar, that they may last a long time.”"
Jeremiah,32,15,"For thus says the L ord of hosts, the God of Israel, “Houses and fields and vineyards will again be bought in this land.” ’"
Jeremiah,32,16,"“After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, then I prayed to the L ord , saying,"
Jeremiah,32,17,"‘Ah Lord G od ! Behold, You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and by Your outstretched arm! Nothing is too difficult for You,"
Jeremiah,32,18,"who shows lovingkindness to thousands, but repays the iniquity of fathers into the bosom of their children after them, O great and mighty God. The L ord of hosts is His name;"
Jeremiah,32,19,"great in counsel and mighty in deed, whose eyes are open to all the ways of the sons of men, giving to everyone according to his ways and according to the fruit of his deeds;"
Jeremiah,32,20,"who has set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, and even to this day both in Israel and among mankind; and You have made a name for Yourself, as at this day."
Jeremiah,32,21,"You brought Your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and with wonders, and with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm and with great terror;"
Jeremiah,32,22,"and gave them this land, which You swore to their forefathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey."
Jeremiah,32,23,"They came in and took possession of it, but they did not obey Your voice or walk in Your law; they have done nothing of all that You commanded them to do; therefore You have made all this calamity come upon them."
Jeremiah,32,24,"Behold, the siege ramps have reached the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans who fight against it, because of the sword, the famine and the pestilence; and what You have spoken has come to pass; and behold, You see it."
Jeremiah,32,25,"You have said to me, O Lord G od , “Buy for yourself the field with money and call in witnesses”—although the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.’ ”"
Jeremiah,32,26,"Then the word of the L ord came to Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah,32,27,"“Behold, I am the L ord , the God of all flesh; is anything too difficult for Me?”"
Jeremiah,32,28,"Therefore thus says the L ord , “Behold, I am about to give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will take it."
Jeremiah,32,29,"The Chaldeans who are fighting against this city will enter and set this city on fire and burn it, with the houses where people have offered incense to Baal on their roofs and poured out drink offerings to other gods to provoke Me to anger."
Jeremiah,32,30,"Indeed the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah have been doing only evil in My sight from their youth; for the sons of Israel have been only provoking Me to anger by the work of their hands,” declares the L ord."
Jeremiah,32,31,"“Indeed this city has been to Me a provocation of My anger and My wrath from the day that they built it, even to this day, so that it should be removed from before My face,"
Jeremiah,32,32,"because of all the evil of the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah which they have done to provoke Me to anger—they, their kings, their leaders, their priests, their prophets, the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,32,33,"They have turned their back to Me and not their face; though I taught them, teaching again and again, they would not listen and receive instruction."
Jeremiah,32,34,"But they put their detestable things in the house which is called by My name, to defile it."
Jeremiah,32,35,"They built the high places of Baal that are in the valley of Ben-hinnom to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire to Molech, which I had not commanded them nor had it entered My mind that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin."
Jeremiah,32,36,"“Now therefore thus says the L ord God of Israel concerning this city of which you say, ‘It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by sword, by famine and by pestilence.’"
Jeremiah,32,37,"Behold, I will gather them out of all the lands to which I have driven them in My anger, in My wrath and in great indignation; and I will bring them back to this place and make them dwell in safety."
Jeremiah,32,38,"They shall be My people, and I will be their God;"
Jeremiah,32,39,"and I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear Me always, for their own good and for the good of their children after them."
Jeremiah,32,40,"I will make an everlasting covenant with them that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; and I will put the fear of Me in their hearts so that they will not turn away from Me."
Jeremiah,32,41,I will rejoice over them to do them good and will faithfully plant them in this land with all My heart and with all My soul.
Jeremiah,32,42,"For thus says the L ord , ‘Just as I brought all this great disaster on this people, so I am going to bring on them all the good that I am promising them."
Jeremiah,32,43,"Fields will be bought in this land of which you say, “It is a desolation, without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.”"
Jeremiah,32,44,"Men will buy fields for money, sign and seal deeds, and call in witnesses in the land of Benjamin, in the environs of Jerusalem, in the cities of Judah, in the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland and in the cities of the Negev; for I will restore their fortunes,’ declares the L ord .”"
Jeremiah,33,1,"Then the word of the L ord came to Jeremiah the second time, while he was still confined in the court of the guard, saying,"
Jeremiah,33,2,"“Thus says the L ord who made the earth, the L ord who formed it to establish it, the L ord is His name,"
Jeremiah,33,3,"‘Call to Me and I will answer you, and I will tell you great and mighty things, which you do not know.’"
Jeremiah,33,4,"For thus says the L ord God of Israel concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah which are broken down to make a defense against the siege ramps and against the sword,"
Jeremiah,33,5,"‘While they are coming to fight with the Chaldeans and to fill them with the corpses of men whom I have slain in My anger and in My wrath, and I have hidden My face from this city because of all their wickedness:"
Jeremiah,33,6,"Behold, I will bring to it health and healing, and I will heal them; and I will reveal to them an abundance of peace and truth."
Jeremiah,33,7,I will restore the fortunes of Judah and the fortunes of Israel and will rebuild them as they were at first.
Jeremiah,33,8,"I will cleanse them from all their iniquity by which they have sinned against Me, and I will pardon all their iniquities by which they have sinned against Me and by which they have transgressed against Me."
Jeremiah,33,9,"It will be to Me a name of joy, praise and glory before all the nations of the earth which will hear of all the good that I do for them, and they will fear and tremble because of all the good and all the peace that I make for it.’"
Jeremiah,33,10,"“Thus says the L ord , ‘Yet again there will be heard in this place, of which you say, “It is a waste, without man and without beast,” that is, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate, without man and without inhabitant and without beast,"
Jeremiah,33,11,"the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those who say, “Give thanks to the L ord of hosts, For the L ord is good, For His lovingkindness is everlasting”; and of those who bring a thank offering into the house of the L ord . For I will restore the fortunes of the land as they were at first,’ says the L ord."
Jeremiah,33,12,"“Thus says the L ord of hosts, ‘There will again be in this place which is waste, without man or beast, and in all its cities, a habitation of shepherds who rest their flocks."
Jeremiah,33,13,"In the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland, in the cities of the Negev, in the land of Benjamin, in the environs of Jerusalem and in the cities of Judah, the flocks will again pass under the hands of the one who numbers them,’ says the L ord."
Jeremiah,33,14,"‘Behold, days are coming,’ declares the L ord , ‘when I will fulfill the good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and the house of Judah."
Jeremiah,33,15,In those days and at that time I will cause a righteous Branch of David to spring forth; and He shall execute justice and righteousness on the earth.
Jeremiah,33,16,In those days Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will dwell in safety; and this is the name by which she will be called: the L ord is our righteousness.’
Jeremiah,33,17,"For thus says the L ord , ‘David shall never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel;"
Jeremiah,33,18,"and the Levitical priests shall never lack a man before Me to offer burnt offerings, to burn grain offerings and to prepare sacrifices continually.’ ”"
Jeremiah,33,19,"The word of the L ord came to Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah,33,20,"“Thus says the L ord , ‘If you can break My covenant for the day and My covenant for the night, so that day and night will not be at their appointed time,"
Jeremiah,33,21,"then My covenant may also be broken with David My servant so that he will not have a son to reign on his throne, and with the Levitical priests, My ministers."
Jeremiah,33,22,"As the host of heaven cannot be counted and the sand of the sea cannot be measured, so I will multiply the descendants of David My servant and the Levites who minister to Me.’ ”"
Jeremiah,33,23,"And the word of the L ord came to Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah,33,24,"“Have you not observed what this people have spoken, saying, ‘The two families which the L ord chose, He has rejected them’? Thus they despise My people, no longer are they as a nation in their sight."
Jeremiah,33,25,"Thus says the L ord , ‘If My covenant for day and night stand not, and the fixed patterns of heaven and earth I have not established,"
Jeremiah,33,26,"then I would reject the descendants of Jacob and David My servant, not taking from his descendants rulers over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. But I will restore their fortunes and will have mercy on them.’ ”"
Jeremiah,34,1,"The word which came to Jeremiah from the L ord , when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army, with all the kingdoms of the earth that were under his dominion and all the peoples, were fighting against Jerusalem and against all its cities, saying,"
Jeremiah,34,2,"“Thus says the L ord God of Israel, ‘Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah and say to him: “Thus says the L ord , ‘Behold, I am giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will burn it with fire."
Jeremiah,34,3,"You will not escape from his hand, for you will surely be captured and delivered into his hand; and you will see the king of Babylon eye to eye, and he will speak with you face to face, and you will go to Babylon.’ ” ’"
Jeremiah,34,4,"Yet hear the word of the L ord , O Zedekiah king of Judah! Thus says the L ord concerning you, ‘You will not die by the sword."
Jeremiah,34,5,"You will die in peace; and as spices were burned for your fathers, the former kings who were before you, so they will burn spices for you; and they will lament for you, “Alas, lord!” ’ For I have spoken the word,” declares the L ord."
Jeremiah,34,6,Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem
Jeremiah,34,7,"when the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and against all the remaining cities of Judah, that is, Lachish and Azekah, for they alone remained as fortified cities among the cities of Judah."
Jeremiah,34,8,The word which came to Jeremiah from the L ord after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people who were in Jerusalem to proclaim release to them:
Jeremiah,34,9,"that each man should set free his male servant and each man his female servant, a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman; so that no one should keep them, a Jew his brother, in bondage."
Jeremiah,34,10,"And all the officials and all the people obeyed who had entered into the covenant that each man should set free his male servant and each man his female servant, so that no one should keep them any longer in bondage; they obeyed, and set them free."
Jeremiah,34,11,"But afterward they turned around and took back the male servants and the female servants whom they had set free, and brought them into subjection for male servants and for female servants."
Jeremiah,34,12,"Then the word of the L ord came to Jeremiah from the L ord , saying,"
Jeremiah,34,13,"“Thus says the L ord God of Israel, ‘I made a covenant with your forefathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, saying,"
Jeremiah,34,14,"“At the end of seven years each of you shall set free his Hebrew brother who has been sold to you and has served you six years, you shall send him out free from you; but your forefathers did not obey Me or incline their ear to Me."
Jeremiah,34,15,"Although recently you had turned and done what is right in My sight, each man proclaiming release to his neighbor, and you had made a covenant before Me in the house which is called by My name."
Jeremiah,34,16,"Yet you turned and profaned My name, and each man took back his male servant and each man his female servant whom you had set free according to their desire, and you brought them into subjection to be your male servants and female servants.” ’"
Jeremiah,34,17,"“Therefore thus says the L ord , ‘You have not obeyed Me in proclaiming release each man to his brother and each man to his neighbor. Behold, I am proclaiming a release to you,’ declares the L ord , ‘to the sword, to the pestilence and to the famine; and I will make you a terror to all the kingdoms of the earth."
Jeremiah,34,18,"I will give the men who have transgressed My covenant, who have not fulfilled the words of the covenant which they made before Me, when they cut the calf in two and passed between its parts—"
Jeremiah,34,19,"the officials of Judah and the officials of Jerusalem, the court officers and the priests and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf—"
Jeremiah,34,20,I will give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their life. And their dead bodies will be food for the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth.
Jeremiah,34,21,"Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials I will give into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their life, and into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon which has gone away from you."
Jeremiah,34,22,"Behold, I am going to command,’ declares the L ord , ‘and I will bring them back to this city; and they will fight against it and take it and burn it with fire; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without inhabitant.’ ”"
Jeremiah,35,1,"The word which came to Jeremiah from the L ord in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying,"
Jeremiah,35,2,"“Go to the house of the Rechabites and speak to them, and bring them into the house of the L ord , into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.”"
Jeremiah,35,3,"Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, son of Habazziniah, and his brothers and all his sons and the whole house of the Rechabites,"
Jeremiah,35,4,"and I brought them into the house of the L ord , into the chamber of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was near the chamber of the officials, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the doorkeeper."
Jeremiah,35,5,"Then I set before the men of the house of the Rechabites pitchers full of wine and cups; and I said to them, “Drink wine!”"
Jeremiah,35,6,"But they said, “We will not drink wine, for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying, ‘You shall not drink wine, you or your sons, forever."
Jeremiah,35,7,"You shall not build a house, and you shall not sow seed and you shall not plant a vineyard or own one; but in tents you shall dwell all your days, that you may live many days in the land where you sojourn.’"
Jeremiah,35,8,"We have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he commanded us, not to drink wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons or our daughters,"
Jeremiah,35,9,nor to build ourselves houses to dwell in; and we do not have vineyard or field or seed.
Jeremiah,35,10,"We have only dwelt in tents, and have obeyed and have done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us."
Jeremiah,35,11,"But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against the land, we said, ‘Come and let us go to Jerusalem before the army of the Chaldeans and before the army of the Arameans.’ So we have dwelt in Jerusalem.”"
Jeremiah,35,12,"Then the word of the L ord came to Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah,35,13,"“Thus says the L ord of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘Go and say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, “Will you not receive instruction by listening to My words?” declares the L ord."
Jeremiah,35,14,"“The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, which he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are observed. So they do not drink wine to this day, for they have obeyed their father’s command. But I have spoken to you again and again; yet you have not listened to Me."
Jeremiah,35,15,"Also I have sent to you all My servants the prophets, sending them again and again, saying: ‘Turn now every man from his evil way and amend your deeds, and do not go after other gods to worship them. Then you will dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your forefathers; but you have not inclined your ear or listened to Me."
Jeremiah,35,16,"Indeed, the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have observed the command of their father which he commanded them, but this people has not listened to Me.’ ” ’"
Jeremiah,35,17,"Therefore thus says the L ord , the God of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘Behold, I am bringing on Judah and on all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the disaster that I have pronounced against them; because I spoke to them but they did not listen, and I have called them but they did not answer.’ ”"
Jeremiah,35,18,"Then Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites, “Thus says the L ord of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘Because you have obeyed the command of Jonadab your father, kept all his commands and done according to all that he commanded you;"
Jeremiah,35,19,"therefore thus says the L ord of hosts, the God of Israel, “Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not lack a man to stand before Me always.” ’ ”"
Jeremiah,36,1,"In the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the L ord , saying,"
Jeremiah,36,2,"“Take a scroll and write on it all the words which I have spoken to you concerning Israel and concerning Judah, and concerning all the nations, from the day I first spoke to you, from the days of Josiah, even to this day."
Jeremiah,36,3,"Perhaps the house of Judah will hear all the calamity which I plan to bring on them, in order that every man will turn from his evil way; then I will forgive their iniquity and their sin.”"
Jeremiah,36,4,"Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah, and Baruch wrote on a scroll at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the L ord which He had spoken to him."
Jeremiah,36,5,"Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, “I am restricted; I cannot go into the house of the L ord."
Jeremiah,36,6,So you go and read from the scroll which you have written at my dictation the words of the L ord to the people in the L ord ’ s house on a fast day. And also you shall read them to all the people of Judah who come from their cities.
Jeremiah,36,7,"Perhaps their supplication will come before the L ord , and everyone will turn from his evil way, for great is the anger and the wrath that the L ord has pronounced against this people.”"
Jeremiah,36,8,"Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading from the book the words of the L ord in the L ord ’ s house."
Jeremiah,36,9,"Now in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem proclaimed a fast before the L ord."
Jeremiah,36,10,"Then Baruch read from the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the L ord in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the upper court, at the entry of the New Gate of the L ord ’ s house, to all the people."
Jeremiah,36,11,"Now when Micaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard all the words of the L ord from the book,"
Jeremiah,36,12,"he went down to the king’s house, into the scribe’s chamber. And behold, all the officials were sitting there—Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the other officials."
Jeremiah,36,13,Micaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard when Baruch read from the book to the people.
Jeremiah,36,14,"Then all the officials sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, “Take in your hand the scroll from which you have read to the people and come.” So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and went to them."
Jeremiah,36,15,"They said to him, “Sit down, please, and read it to us.” So Baruch read it to them."
Jeremiah,36,16,"When they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one to another and said to Baruch, “We will surely report all these words to the king.”"
Jeremiah,36,17,"And they asked Baruch, saying, “Tell us, please, how did you write all these words? Was it at his dictation?”"
Jeremiah,36,18,"Then Baruch said to them, “He dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them with ink on the book.”"
Jeremiah,36,19,"Then the officials said to Baruch, “Go, hide yourself, you and Jeremiah, and do not let anyone know where you are.”"
Jeremiah,36,20,"So they went to the king in the court, but they had deposited the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and they reported all the words to the king."
Jeremiah,36,21,"Then the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he took it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it to the king as well as to all the officials who stood beside the king."
Jeremiah,36,22,"Now the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month, with a fire burning in the brazier before him."
Jeremiah,36,23,"When Jehudi had read three or four columns, the king cut it with a scribe’s knife and threw it into the fire that was in the brazier, until all the scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier."
Jeremiah,36,24,"Yet the king and all his servants who heard all these words were not afraid, nor did they rend their garments."
Jeremiah,36,25,"Even though Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah pleaded with the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them."
Jeremiah,36,26,"And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king’s son, Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel to seize Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet, but the L ord hid them."
Jeremiah,36,27,"Then the word of the L ord came to Jeremiah after the king had burned the scroll and the words which Baruch had written at the dictation of Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah,36,28,“Take again another scroll and write on it all the former words that were on the first scroll which Jehoiakim the king of Judah burned.
Jeremiah,36,29,"And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, ‘Thus says the L ord , “You have burned this scroll, saying, ‘Why have you written on it that the king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land, and will make man and beast to cease from it?’ ”"
Jeremiah,36,30,"Therefore thus says the L ord concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah, “He shall have no one to sit on the throne of David, and his dead body shall be cast out to the heat of the day and the frost of the night."
Jeremiah,36,31,"I will also punish him and his descendants and his servants for their iniquity, and I will bring on them and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the men of Judah all the calamity that I have declared to them—but they did not listen.” ’ ”"
Jeremiah,36,32,"Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch the son of Neriah, the scribe, and he wrote on it at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and many similar words were added to them."
Jeremiah,37,1,"Now Zedekiah the son of Josiah whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had made king in the land of Judah, reigned as king in place of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim."
Jeremiah,37,2,But neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land listened to the words of the L ord which He spoke through Jeremiah the prophet.
Jeremiah,37,3,"Yet King Zedekiah sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, to Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “Please pray to the L ord our God on our behalf.”"
Jeremiah,37,4,"Now Jeremiah was still coming in and going out among the people, for they had not yet put him in the prison."
Jeremiah,37,5,"Meanwhile, Pharaoh’s army had set out from Egypt; and when the Chaldeans who had been besieging Jerusalem heard the report about them, they lifted the siege from Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,37,6,"Then the word of the L ord came to Jeremiah the prophet, saying,"
Jeremiah,37,7,"“Thus says the L ord God of Israel, ‘Thus you are to say to the king of Judah, who sent you to Me to inquire of Me: “Behold, Pharaoh’s army which has come out for your assistance is going to return to its own land of Egypt."
Jeremiah,37,8,"The Chaldeans will also return and fight against this city, and they will capture it and burn it with fire.” ’"
Jeremiah,37,9,"Thus says the L ord , ‘Do not deceive yourselves, saying, “The Chaldeans will surely go away from us,” for they will not go."
Jeremiah,37,10,"For even if you had defeated the entire army of Chaldeans who were fighting against you, and there were only wounded men left among them, each man in his tent, they would rise up and burn this city with fire.’ ”"
Jeremiah,37,11,"Now it happened when the army of the Chaldeans had lifted the siege from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh’s army,"
Jeremiah,37,12,that Jeremiah went out from Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin in order to take possession of some property there among the people.
Jeremiah,37,13,"While he was at the Gate of Benjamin, a captain of the guard whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah the son of Hananiah was there; and he arrested Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “You are going over to the Chaldeans!”"
Jeremiah,37,14,"But Jeremiah said, “A lie! I am not going over to the Chaldeans”; yet he would not listen to him. So Irijah arrested Jeremiah and brought him to the officials."
Jeremiah,37,15,"Then the officials were angry at Jeremiah and beat him, and they put him in jail in the house of Jonathan the scribe, which they had made into the prison."
Jeremiah,37,16,"For Jeremiah had come into the dungeon, that is, the vaulted cell; and Jeremiah stayed there many days."
Jeremiah,37,17,"Now King Zedekiah sent and took him out; and in his palace the king secretly asked him and said, “Is there a word from the L ord ?” And Jeremiah said, “There is!” Then he said, “You will be given into the hand of the king of Babylon!”"
Jeremiah,37,18,"Moreover Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, “ In what way have I sinned against you, or against your servants, or against this people, that you have put me in prison?"
Jeremiah,37,19,"Where then are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you or against this land’?"
Jeremiah,37,20,"But now, please listen, O my lord the king; please let my petition come before you and do not make me return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, that I may not die there.”"
Jeremiah,37,21,"Then King Zedekiah gave commandment, and they committed Jeremiah to the court of the guardhouse and gave him a loaf of bread daily from the bakers’ street, until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the court of the guardhouse."
Jeremiah,38,1,"Now Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchijah heard the words that Jeremiah was speaking to all the people, saying,"
Jeremiah,38,2,"“Thus says the L ord , ‘He who stays in this city will die by the sword and by famine and by pestilence, but he who goes out to the Chaldeans will live and have his own life as booty and stay alive.’"
Jeremiah,38,3,"Thus says the L ord , ‘This city will certainly be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon and he will capture it.’ ”"
Jeremiah,38,4,"Then the officials said to the king, “Now let this man be put to death, inasmuch as he is discouraging the men of war who are left in this city and all the people, by speaking such words to them; for this man is not seeking the well-being of this people but rather their harm.”"
Jeremiah,38,5,"So King Zedekiah said, “Behold, he is in your hands; for the king can do nothing against you.”"
Jeremiah,38,6,"Then they took Jeremiah and cast him into the cistern of Malchijah the king’s son, which was in the court of the guardhouse; and they let Jeremiah down with ropes. Now in the cistern there was no water but only mud, and Jeremiah sank into the mud."
Jeremiah,38,7,"But Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, while he was in the king’s palace, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern. Now the king was sitting in the Gate of Benjamin;"
Jeremiah,38,8,"and Ebed-melech went out from the king’s palace and spoke to the king, saying,"
Jeremiah,38,9,"“My lord the king, these men have acted wickedly in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet whom they have cast into the cistern; and he will die right where he is because of the famine, for there is no more bread in the city.”"
Jeremiah,38,10,"Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, “Take thirty men from here under your authority and bring up Jeremiah the prophet from the cistern before he dies.”"
Jeremiah,38,11,So Ebed-melech took the men under his authority and went into the king’s palace to a place beneath the storeroom and took from there worn-out clothes and worn-out rags and let them down by ropes into the cistern to Jeremiah.
Jeremiah,38,12,"Then Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, “Now put these worn-out clothes and rags under your armpits under the ropes”; and Jeremiah did so."
Jeremiah,38,13,"So they pulled Jeremiah up with the ropes and lifted him out of the cistern, and Jeremiah stayed in the court of the guardhouse."
Jeremiah,38,14,"Then King Zedekiah sent and had Jeremiah the prophet brought to him at the third entrance that is in the house of the L ord ; and the king said to Jeremiah, “I am going to ask you something; do not hide anything from me.”"
Jeremiah,38,15,"Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I tell you, will you not certainly put me to death? Besides, if I give you advice, you will not listen to me.”"
Jeremiah,38,16,"But King Zedekiah swore to Jeremiah in secret saying, “As the L ord lives, who made this life for us, surely I will not put you to death nor will I give you over to the hand of these men who are seeking your life.”"
Jeremiah,38,17,"Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “Thus says the L ord God of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘If you will indeed go out to the officers of the king of Babylon, then you will live, this city will not be burned with fire, and you and your household will survive."
Jeremiah,38,18,"But if you will not go out to the officers of the king of Babylon, then this city will be given over to the hand of the Chaldeans; and they will burn it with fire, and you yourself will not escape from their hand.’ ”"
Jeremiah,38,19,"Then King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “I dread the Jews who have gone over to the Chaldeans, for they may give me over into their hand and they will abuse me.”"
Jeremiah,38,20,"But Jeremiah said, “They will not give you over. Please obey the L ord in what I am saying to you, that it may go well with you and you may live."
Jeremiah,38,21,"But if you keep refusing to go out, this is the word which the L ord has shown me:"
Jeremiah,38,22,"‘Then behold, all of the women who have been left in the palace of the king of Judah are going to be brought out to the officers of the king of Babylon; and those women will say, “Your close friends Have misled and overpowered you; While your feet were sunk in the mire, They turned back.”"
Jeremiah,38,23,"They will also bring out all your wives and your sons to the Chaldeans, and you yourself will not escape from their hand, but will be seized by the hand of the king of Babylon, and this city will be burned with fire.’ ”"
Jeremiah,38,24,"Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Let no man know about these words and you will not die."
Jeremiah,38,25,"But if the officials hear that I have talked with you and come to you and say to you, ‘Tell us now what you said to the king and what the king said to you; do not hide it from us and we will not put you to death,’"
Jeremiah,38,26,"then you are to say to them, ‘I was presenting my petition before the king, not to make me return to the house of Jonathan to die there.’ ”"
Jeremiah,38,27,"Then all the officials came to Jeremiah and questioned him. So he reported to them in accordance with all these words which the king had commanded; and they ceased speaking with him, since the conversation had not been overheard."
Jeremiah,38,28,So Jeremiah stayed in the court of the guardhouse until the day that Jerusalem was captured.
Jeremiah,39,1,"Now when Jerusalem was captured in the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came to Jerusalem and laid siege to it;"
Jeremiah,39,2,"in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the city wall was breached."
Jeremiah,39,3,"Then all the officials of the king of Babylon came in and sat down at the Middle Gate: Nergal-sar-ezer, Samgar-nebu, Sar-sekim the Rab-saris, Nergal-sar-ezer the Rab-mag, and all the rest of the officials of the king of Babylon."
Jeremiah,39,4,"When Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, they fled and went out of the city at night by way of the king’s garden through the gate between the two walls; and he went out toward the Arabah."
Jeremiah,39,5,"But the army of the Chaldeans pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and they seized him and brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he passed sentence on him."
Jeremiah,39,6,Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes at Riblah; the king of Babylon also slew all the nobles of Judah.
Jeremiah,39,7,He then blinded Zedekiah’s eyes and bound him in fetters of bronze to bring him to Babylon.
Jeremiah,39,8,"The Chaldeans also burned with fire the king’s palace and the houses of the people, and they broke down the walls of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,39,9,"As for the rest of the people who were left in the city, the deserters who had gone over to him and the rest of the people who remained, Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard carried them into exile in Babylon."
Jeremiah,39,10,"But some of the poorest people who had nothing, Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard left behind in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at that time."
Jeremiah,39,11,"Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave orders about Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard, saying,"
Jeremiah,39,12,"“Take him and look after him, and do nothing harmful to him, but rather deal with him just as he tells you.”"
Jeremiah,39,13,"So Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard sent word, along with Nebushazban the Rab-saris, and Nergal-sar-ezer the Rab-mag, and all the leading officers of the king of Babylon;"
Jeremiah,39,14,"they even sent and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guardhouse and entrusted him to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, to take him home. So he stayed among the people."
Jeremiah,39,15,"Now the word of the L ord had come to Jeremiah while he was confined in the court of the guardhouse, saying,"
Jeremiah,39,16,"“Go and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, ‘Thus says the L ord of hosts, the God of Israel, “Behold, I am about to bring My words on this city for disaster and not for prosperity; and they will take place before you on that day."
Jeremiah,39,17,"But I will deliver you on that day,” declares the L ord , “and you will not be given into the hand of the men whom you dread."
Jeremiah,39,18,"For I will certainly rescue you, and you will not fall by the sword; but you will have your own life as booty, because you have trusted in Me,” declares the L ord .’ ”"
Jeremiah,40,1,"The word which came to Jeremiah from the L ord after Nebuzaradan captain of the bodyguard had released him from Ramah, when he had taken him bound in chains among all the exiles of Jerusalem and Judah who were being exiled to Babylon."
Jeremiah,40,2,"Now the captain of the bodyguard had taken Jeremiah and said to him, “The L ord your God promised this calamity against this place;"
Jeremiah,40,3,"and the L ord has brought it on and done just as He promised. Because you people sinned against the L ord and did not listen to His voice, therefore this thing has happened to you."
Jeremiah,40,4,"But now, behold, I am freeing you today from the chains which are on your hands. If you would prefer to come with me to Babylon, come along, and I will look after you; but if you would prefer not to come with me to Babylon, never mind. Look, the whole land is before you; go wherever it seems good and right for you to go.”"
Jeremiah,40,5,"As Jeremiah was still not going back, he said, “Go on back then to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed over the cities of Judah, and stay with him among the people; or else go anywhere it seems right for you to go.” So the captain of the bodyguard gave him a ration and a gift and let him go."
Jeremiah,40,6,Then Jeremiah went to Mizpah to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam and stayed with him among the people who were left in the land.
Jeremiah,40,7,"Now all the commanders of the forces that were in the field, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam over the land and that he had put him in charge of the men, women and children, those of the poorest of the land who had not been exiled to Babylon."
Jeremiah,40,8,"So they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah, along with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, both they and their men."
Jeremiah,40,9,"Then Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, swore to them and to their men, saying, “Do not be afraid of serving the Chaldeans; stay in the land and serve the king of Babylon, that it may go well with you."
Jeremiah,40,10,"Now as for me, behold, I am going to stay at Mizpah to stand for you before the Chaldeans who come to us; but as for you, gather in wine and summer fruit and oil and put them in your storage vessels, and live in your cities that you have taken over.”"
Jeremiah,40,11,"Likewise, also all the Jews who were in Moab and among the sons of Ammon and in Edom and who were in all the other countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant for Judah, and that he had appointed over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan."
Jeremiah,40,12,"Then all the Jews returned from all the places to which they had been driven away and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and gathered in wine and summer fruit in great abundance."
Jeremiah,40,13,Now Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were in the field came to Gedaliah at Mizpah
Jeremiah,40,14,"and said to him, “Are you well aware that Baalis the king of the sons of Ammon has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life?” But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam did not believe them."
Jeremiah,40,15,"Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke secretly to Gedaliah in Mizpah, saying, “Let me go and kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and not a man will know! Why should he take your life, so that all the Jews who are gathered to you would be scattered and the remnant of Judah would perish?”"
Jeremiah,40,16,"But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, “Do not do this thing, for you are telling a lie about Ishmael.”"
Jeremiah,41,1,"In the seventh month Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal family and one of the chief officers of the king, along with ten men, came to Mizpah to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. While they were eating bread together there in Mizpah,"
Jeremiah,41,2,"Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were with him arose and struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the sword and put to death the one whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land."
Jeremiah,41,3,"Ishmael also struck down all the Jews who were with him, that is with Gedaliah at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans who were found there, the men of war."
Jeremiah,41,4,"Now it happened on the next day after the killing of Gedaliah, when no one knew about it,"
Jeremiah,41,5,"that eighty men came from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria with their beards shaved off and their clothes torn and their bodies gashed, having grain offerings and incense in their hands to bring to the house of the L ord."
Jeremiah,41,6,"Then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he went; and as he met them, he said to them, “Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam!”"
Jeremiah,41,7,"Yet it turned out that as soon as they came inside the city, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the men that were with him slaughtered them and cast them into the cistern."
Jeremiah,41,8,"But ten men who were found among them said to Ishmael, “Do not put us to death; for we have stores of wheat, barley, oil and honey hidden in the field.” So he refrained and did not put them to death along with their companions."
Jeremiah,41,9,"Now as for the cistern where Ishmael had cast all the corpses of the men whom he had struck down because of Gedaliah, it was the one that King Asa had made on account of Baasha, king of Israel; Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain."
Jeremiah,41,10,"Then Ishmael took captive all the remnant of the people who were in Mizpah, the king’s daughters and all the people who were left in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard had put under the charge of Gedaliah the son of Ahikam; thus Ishmael the son of Nethaniah took them captive and proceeded to cross over to the sons of Ammon."
Jeremiah,41,11,But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were with him heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done.
Jeremiah,41,12,So they took all the men and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and they found him by the great pool that is in Gibeon.
Jeremiah,41,13,"Now as soon as all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah and the commanders of the forces that were with him, they were glad."
Jeremiah,41,14,"So all the people whom Ishmael had taken captive from Mizpah turned around and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah."
Jeremiah,41,15,But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men and went to the sons of Ammon.
Jeremiah,41,16,"Then Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were with him took from Mizpah all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, after he had struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, that is, the men who were soldiers, the women, the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gibeon."
Jeremiah,41,17,"And they went and stayed in Geruth Chimham, which is beside Bethlehem, in order to proceed into Egypt"
Jeremiah,41,18,"because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, since Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land."
Jeremiah,42,1,"Then all the commanders of the forces, Johanan the son of Kareah, Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people both small and great approached"
Jeremiah,42,2,"and said to Jeremiah the prophet, “Please let our petition come before you, and pray for us to the L ord your God, that is for all this remnant; because we are left but a few out of many, as your own eyes now see us,"
Jeremiah,42,3,that the L ord your God may tell us the way in which we should walk and the thing that we should do.”
Jeremiah,42,4,"Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them, “I have heard you. Behold, I am going to pray to the L ord your God in accordance with your words; and I will tell you the whole message which the L ord will answer you. I will not keep back a word from you.”"
Jeremiah,42,5,"Then they said to Jeremiah, “May the L ord be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not act in accordance with the whole message with which the L ord your God will send you to us."
Jeremiah,42,6,"Whether it is pleasant or unpleasant, we will listen to the voice of the L ord our God to whom we are sending you, so that it may go well with us when we listen to the voice of the L ord our God.”"
Jeremiah,42,7,Now at the end of ten days the word of the L ord came to Jeremiah.
Jeremiah,42,8,"Then he called for Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were with him, and for all the people both small and great,"
Jeremiah,42,9,"and said to them, “Thus says the L ord the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your petition before Him:"
Jeremiah,42,10,"‘If you will indeed stay in this land, then I will build you up and not tear you down, and I will plant you and not uproot you; for I will relent concerning the calamity that I have inflicted on you."
Jeremiah,42,11,"Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, whom you are now fearing; do not be afraid of him,’ declares the L ord , ‘for I am with you to save you and deliver you from his hand."
Jeremiah,42,12,"I will also show you compassion, so that he will have compassion on you and restore you to your own soil."
Jeremiah,42,13,"But if you are going to say, “We will not stay in this land,” so as not to listen to the voice of the L ord your God,"
Jeremiah,42,14,"saying, “No, but we will go to the land of Egypt, where we will not see war or hear the sound of a trumpet or hunger for bread, and we will stay there”;"
Jeremiah,42,15,"then in that case listen to the word of the L ord , O remnant of Judah. Thus says the L ord of hosts, the God of Israel, “If you really set your mind to enter Egypt and go in to reside there,"
Jeremiah,42,16,"then the sword, which you are afraid of, will overtake you there in the land of Egypt; and the famine, about which you are anxious, will follow closely after you there in Egypt, and you will die there."
Jeremiah,42,17,"So all the men who set their mind to go to Egypt to reside there will die by the sword, by famine and by pestilence; and they will have no survivors or refugees from the calamity that I am going to bring on them.” ’ ”"
Jeremiah,42,18,"For thus says the L ord of hosts, the God of Israel, “As My anger and wrath have been poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so My wrath will be poured out on you when you enter Egypt. And you will become a curse, an object of horror, an imprecation and a reproach; and you will see this place no more.”"
Jeremiah,42,19,"The L ord has spoken to you, O remnant of Judah, “Do not go into Egypt!” You should clearly understand that today I have testified against you."
Jeremiah,42,20,"For you have only deceived yourselves; for it is you who sent me to the L ord your God, saying, “Pray for us to the L ord our God; and whatever the L ord our God says, tell us so, and we will do it.”"
Jeremiah,42,21,"So I have told you today, but you have not obeyed the L ord your God, even in whatever He has sent me to tell you."
Jeremiah,42,22,"Therefore you should now clearly understand that you will die by the sword, by famine and by pestilence, in the place where you wish to go to reside."
Jeremiah,43,1,"But as soon as Jeremiah, whom the L ord their God had sent, had finished telling all the people all the words of the L ord their God—that is, all these words—"
Jeremiah,43,2,"Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the arrogant men said to Jeremiah, “You are telling a lie! The L ord our God has not sent you to say, ‘You are not to enter Egypt to reside there’;"
Jeremiah,43,3,"but Baruch the son of Neriah is inciting you against us to give us over into the hand of the Chaldeans, so they will put us to death or exile us to Babylon.”"
Jeremiah,43,4,"So Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces, and all the people, did not obey the voice of the L ord to stay in the land of Judah."
Jeremiah,43,5,"But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces took the entire remnant of Judah who had returned from all the nations to which they had been driven away, in order to reside in the land of Judah—"
Jeremiah,43,6,"the men, the women, the children, the king’s daughters and every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, together with Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch the son of Neriah—"
Jeremiah,43,7,and they entered the land of Egypt (for they did not obey the voice of the L ord ) and went in as far as Tahpanhes.
Jeremiah,43,8,"Then the word of the L ord came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,"
Jeremiah,43,9,"“Take some large stones in your hands and hide them in the mortar in the brick terrace which is at the entrance of Pharaoh’s palace in Tahpanhes, in the sight of some of the Jews;"
Jeremiah,43,10,"and say to them, ‘Thus says the L ord of hosts, the God of Israel, “Behold, I am going to send and get Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, My servant, and I am going to set his throne right over these stones that I have hidden; and he will spread his canopy over them."
Jeremiah,43,11,"He will also come and strike the land of Egypt; those who are meant for death will be given over to death, and those for captivity to captivity, and those for the sword to the sword."
Jeremiah,43,12,"And I shall set fire to the temples of the gods of Egypt, and he will burn them and take them captive. So he will wrap himself with the land of Egypt as a shepherd wraps himself with his garment, and he will depart from there safely."
Jeremiah,43,13,"He will also shatter the obelisks of Heliopolis, which is in the land of Egypt; and the temples of the gods of Egypt he will burn with fire.” ’ ”"
Jeremiah,44,1,"The word that came to Jeremiah for all the Jews living in the land of Egypt, those who were living in Migdol, Tahpanhes, Memphis, and the land of Pathros, saying,"
Jeremiah,44,2,"“Thus says the L ord of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘You yourselves have seen all the calamity that I have brought on Jerusalem and all the cities of Judah; and behold, this day they are in ruins and no one lives in them,"
Jeremiah,44,3,"because of their wickedness which they committed so as to provoke Me to anger by continuing to burn sacrifices and to serve other gods whom they had not known, neither they, you, nor your fathers."
Jeremiah,44,4,"Yet I sent you all My servants the prophets, again and again, saying, “Oh, do not do this abominable thing which I hate.”"
Jeremiah,44,5,"But they did not listen or incline their ears to turn from their wickedness, so as not to burn sacrifices to other gods."
Jeremiah,44,6,"Therefore My wrath and My anger were poured out and burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, so they have become a ruin and a desolation as it is this day."
Jeremiah,44,7,"Now then thus says the L ord God of hosts, the God of Israel, “Why are you doing great harm to yourselves, so as to cut off from you man and woman, child and infant, from among Judah, leaving yourselves without remnant,"
Jeremiah,44,8,"provoking Me to anger with the works of your hands, burning sacrifices to other gods in the land of Egypt, where you are entering to reside, so that you might be cut off and become a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?"
Jeremiah,44,9,"Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?"
Jeremiah,44,10,"But they have not become contrite even to this day, nor have they feared nor walked in My law or My statutes, which I have set before you and before your fathers.” ’"
Jeremiah,44,11,"“Therefore thus says the L ord of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘Behold, I am going to set My face against you for woe, even to cut off all Judah."
Jeremiah,44,12,"And I will take away the remnant of Judah who have set their mind on entering the land of Egypt to reside there, and they will all meet their end in the land of Egypt; they will fall by the sword and meet their end by famine. Both small and great will die by the sword and famine; and they will become a curse, an object of horror, an imprecation and a reproach."
Jeremiah,44,13,"And I will punish those who live in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, with the sword, with famine and with pestilence."
Jeremiah,44,14,"So there will be no refugees or survivors for the remnant of Judah who have entered the land of Egypt to reside there and then to return to the land of Judah, to which they are longing to return and live; for none will return except a few refugees.’ ”"
Jeremiah,44,15,"Then all the men who were aware that their wives were burning sacrifices to other gods, along with all the women who were standing by, as a large assembly, including all the people who were living in Pathros in the land of Egypt, responded to Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah,44,16,"“As for the message that you have spoken to us in the name of the L ord , we are not going to listen to you!"
Jeremiah,44,17,"But rather we will certainly carry out every word that has proceeded from our mouths, by burning sacrifices to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, just as we ourselves, our forefathers, our kings and our princes did in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then we had plenty of food and were well off and saw no misfortune."
Jeremiah,44,18,"But since we stopped burning sacrifices to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked everything and have met our end by the sword and by famine.”"
Jeremiah,44,19,"“And,” said the women, “when we were burning sacrifices to the queen of heaven and were pouring out drink offerings to her, was it without our husbands that we made for her sacrificial cakes in her image and poured out drink offerings to her?”"
Jeremiah,44,20,"Then Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men and women—even to all the people who were giving him such an answer—saying,"
Jeremiah,44,21,"“As for the smoking sacrifices that you burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your forefathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the L ord remember them and did not all this come into His mind?"
Jeremiah,44,22,"So the L ord was no longer able to endure it, because of the evil of your deeds, because of the abominations which you have committed; thus your land has become a ruin, an object of horror and a curse, without an inhabitant, as it is this day."
Jeremiah,44,23,"Because you have burned sacrifices and have sinned against the L ord and not obeyed the voice of the L ord or walked in His law, His statutes or His testimonies, therefore this calamity has befallen you, as it has this day.”"
Jeremiah,44,24,"Then Jeremiah said to all the people, including all the women, “Hear the word of the L ord , all Judah who are in the land of Egypt,"
Jeremiah,44,25,"thus says the L ord of hosts, the God of Israel, as follows: ‘As for you and your wives, you have spoken with your mouths and fulfilled it with your hands, saying, “We will certainly perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn sacrifices to the queen of heaven and pour out drink offerings to her.” Go ahead and confirm your vows, and certainly perform your vows!’"
Jeremiah,44,26,"Nevertheless hear the word of the L ord , all Judah who are living in the land of Egypt, ‘Behold, I have sworn by My great name,’ says the L ord , ‘never shall My name be invoked again by the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, “As the Lord G od lives.”"
Jeremiah,44,27,"Behold, I am watching over them for harm and not for good, and all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt will meet their end by the sword and by famine until they are completely gone."
Jeremiah,44,28,"Those who escape the sword will return out of the land of Egypt to the land of Judah few in number. Then all the remnant of Judah who have gone to the land of Egypt to reside there will know whose word will stand, Mine or theirs."
Jeremiah,44,29,"This will be the sign to you,’ declares the L ord , ‘that I am going to punish you in this place, so that you may know that My words will surely stand against you for harm.’"
Jeremiah,44,30,"Thus says the L ord , ‘Behold, I am going to give over Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt to the hand of his enemies, to the hand of those who seek his life, just as I gave over Zedekiah king of Judah to the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who was his enemy and was seeking his life.’ ”"
Jeremiah,45,1," This is the message which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah, when he had written down these words in a book at Jeremiah’s dictation, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying:"
Jeremiah,45,2,"“Thus says the L ord the God of Israel to you, O Baruch:"
Jeremiah,45,3,"‘You said, “Ah, woe is me! For the L ord has added sorrow to my pain; I am weary with my groaning and have found no rest.” ’"
Jeremiah,45,4,"Thus you are to say to him, ‘Thus says the L ord , “Behold, what I have built I am about to tear down, and what I have planted I am about to uproot, that is, the whole land.”"
Jeremiah,45,5,"But you, are you seeking great things for yourself? Do not seek them; for behold, I am going to bring disaster on all flesh,’ declares the L ord , ‘but I will give your life to you as booty in all the places where you may go.’ ”"
Jeremiah,46,1,That which came as the word of the L ord to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations.
Jeremiah,46,2,"To Egypt, concerning the army of Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt, which was by the Euphrates River at Carchemish, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon defeated in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah:"
Jeremiah,46,3,"“Line up the shield and buckler, And draw near for the battle!"
Jeremiah,46,4,"Harness the horses, And mount the steeds, And take your stand with helmets on! Polish the spears, Put on the scale-armor!"
Jeremiah,46,5,"Why have I seen it? They are terrified, They are drawing back, And their mighty men are defeated And have taken refuge in flight, Without facing back; Terror is on every side!” Declares the L ord."
Jeremiah,46,6,"Let not the swift man flee, Nor the mighty man escape; In the north beside the river Euphrates They have stumbled and fallen."
Jeremiah,46,7,"Who is this that rises like the Nile, Like the rivers whose waters surge about?"
Jeremiah,46,8,"Egypt rises like the Nile, Even like the rivers whose waters surge about; And He has said, “I will rise and cover that land; I will surely destroy the city and its inhabitants.”"
Jeremiah,46,9,"Go up, you horses, and drive madly, you chariots, That the mighty men may march forward: Ethiopia and Put, that handle the shield, And the Lydians, that handle and bend the bow."
Jeremiah,46,10,"For that day belongs to the Lord G od of hosts, A day of vengeance, so as to avenge Himself on His foes; And the sword will devour and be satiated And drink its fill of their blood; For there will be a slaughter for the Lord G od of hosts, In the land of the north by the river Euphrates."
Jeremiah,46,11,"Go up to Gilead and obtain balm, O virgin daughter of Egypt! In vain have you multiplied remedies; There is no healing for you."
Jeremiah,46,12,"The nations have heard of your shame, And the earth is full of your cry of distress; For one warrior has stumbled over another, And both of them have fallen down together."
Jeremiah,46,13, This is the message which the L ord spoke to Jeremiah the prophet about the coming of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to smite the land of Egypt:
Jeremiah,46,14,"“Declare in Egypt and proclaim in Migdol, Proclaim also in Memphis and Tahpanhes; Say, ‘Take your stand and get yourself ready, For the sword has devoured those around you.’"
Jeremiah,46,15,Why have your mighty ones become prostrate? They do not stand because the L ord has thrust them down.
Jeremiah,46,16,"They have repeatedly stumbled; Indeed, they have fallen one against another. Then they said, ‘Get up! And let us go back To our own people and our native land Away from the sword of the oppressor.’"
Jeremiah,46,17,"They cried there, ‘Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a big noise; He has let the appointed time pass by!’"
Jeremiah,46,18,"As I live,” declares the King Whose name is the L ord of hosts, “Surely one shall come who looms up like Tabor among the mountains, Or like Carmel by the sea."
Jeremiah,46,19,"Make your baggage ready for exile, O daughter dwelling in Egypt, For Memphis will become a desolation; It will even be burned down and bereft of inhabitants."
Jeremiah,46,20,"Egypt is a pretty heifer, But a horsefly is coming from the north—it is coming!"
Jeremiah,46,21,"Also her mercenaries in her midst Are like fattened calves, For even they too have turned back and have fled away together; They did not stand their ground. For the day of their calamity has come upon them, The time of their punishment."
Jeremiah,46,22,Its sound moves along like a serpent; For they move on like an army And come to her as woodcutters with axes.
Jeremiah,46,23,"They have cut down her forest,” declares the L ord; “Surely it will no more be found, Even though they are now more numerous than locusts And are without number."

Jeremiah,46,26,"I shall give them over to the power of those who are seeking their lives, even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and into the hand of his officers. Afterwards, however, it will be inhabited as in the days of old,” declares the L ord."
Jeremiah,46,27,"“But as for you, O Jacob My servant, do not fear, Nor be dismayed, O Israel! For, see, I am going to save you from afar, And your descendants from the land of their captivity; And Jacob will return and be undisturbed And secure, with no one making him tremble."
Jeremiah,46,28,"O Jacob My servant, do not fear,” declares the L ord, “For I am with you. For I will make a full end of all the nations Where I have driven you, Yet I will not make a full end of you; But I will correct you properly And by no means leave you unpunished.”"

Jeremiah,47,2,"Thus says the L ord: “Behold, waters are going to rise from the north And become an overflowing torrent, And overflow the land and all its fullness, The city and those who live in it; And the men will cry out, And every inhabitant of the land will wail."
Jeremiah,47,3,"Because of the noise of the galloping hoofs of his stallions, The tumult of his chariots, and the rumbling of his wheels, The fathers have not turned back for their children, Because of the limpness of their hands,"

Jeremiah,47,5,"Baldness has come upon Gaza; Ashkelon has been ruined. O remnant of their valley, How long will you gash yourself?"
Jeremiah,47,6,"Ah, sword of the L ord, How long will you not be quiet? Withdraw into your sheath; Be at rest and stay still."
Jeremiah,47,7,"How can it be quiet, When the L ord has given it an order? Against Ashkelon and against the seacoast— There He has assigned it.”"

Jeremiah,48,2,"There is praise for Moab no longer; In Heshbon they have devised calamity against her: ‘Come and let us cut her off from being a nation!’ You too, Madmen, will be silenced; The sword will follow after you."
Jeremiah,48,3,"The sound of an outcry from Horonaim, ‘Devastation and great destruction!’"
Jeremiah,48,4,"Moab is broken, Her little ones have sounded out a cry of distress."
Jeremiah,48,5,For by the ascent of Luhith They will ascend with continual weeping; For at the descent of Horonaim They have heard the anguished cry of destruction.
Jeremiah,48,6,"Flee, save your lives, That you may be like a juniper in the wilderness."

Jeremiah,48,11,"“Moab has been at ease since his youth; He has also been undisturbed, like wine on its dregs, And he has not been emptied from vessel to vessel, Nor has he gone into exile. Therefore he retains his flavor, And his aroma has not changed."
Jeremiah,48,12,"Therefore behold, the days are coming,” declares the L ord , “when I will send to him those who tip vessels, and they will tip him over, and they will empty his vessels and shatter his jars."
Jeremiah,48,13,"And Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel, their confidence."

Jeremiah,48,26,"“Make him drunk, for he has become arrogant toward the L ord ; so Moab will wallow in his vomit, and he also will become a laughingstock."

Jeremiah,51,54,"The sound of an outcry from Babylon, And of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans!"
Jeremiah,51,55,"For the L ord is going to destroy Babylon, And He will make her loud noise vanish from her. And their waves will roar like many waters; The tumult of their voices sounds forth."

Jeremiah,51,59,"The message which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the grandson of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. (Now Seraiah was quartermaster.)"
Jeremiah,51,60,"So Jeremiah wrote in a single scroll all the calamity which would come upon Babylon, that is, all these words which have been written concerning Babylon."
Jeremiah,51,61,"Then Jeremiah said to Seraiah, “As soon as you come to Babylon, then see that you read all these words aloud,"
Jeremiah,51,62,"and say, ‘You, O L ord , have promised concerning this place to cut it off, so that there will be nothing dwelling in it, whether man or beast, but it will be a perpetual desolation.’"
Jeremiah,51,63,"And as soon as you finish reading this scroll, you will tie a stone to it and throw it into the middle of the Euphrates,"
Jeremiah,51,64,"and say, ‘Just so shall Babylon sink down and not rise again because of the calamity that I am going to bring upon her; and they will become exhausted.’ ” Thus far are the words of Jeremiah."
Jeremiah,52,1,"Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah."
Jeremiah,52,2,He did evil in the sight of the L ord like all that Jehoiakim had done.
Jeremiah,52,3,For through the anger of the L ord this came about in Jerusalem and Judah until He cast them out from His presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
Jeremiah,52,4,"Now it came about in the ninth year of his reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, camped against it and built a siege wall all around it."
Jeremiah,52,5,So the city was under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
Jeremiah,52,6,On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land.
Jeremiah,52,7,"Then the city was broken into, and all the men of war fled and went forth from the city at night by way of the gate between the two walls which was by the king’s garden, though the Chaldeans were all around the city. And they went by way of the Arabah."
Jeremiah,52,8,"But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho, and all his army was scattered from him."
Jeremiah,52,9,"Then they captured the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he passed sentence on him."
Jeremiah,52,10,"The king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and he also slaughtered all the princes of Judah in Riblah."
Jeremiah,52,11,Then he blinded the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him with bronze fetters and brought him to Babylon and put him in prison until the day of his death.
Jeremiah,52,12,"Now on the tenth day of the fifth month, which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard, who was in the service of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,52,13,"He burned the house of the L ord , the king’s house and all the houses of Jerusalem; even every large house he burned with fire."
Jeremiah,52,14,So all the army of the Chaldeans who were with the captain of the guard broke down all the walls around Jerusalem.
Jeremiah,52,15,"Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away into exile some of the poorest of the people, the rest of the people who were left in the city, the deserters who had deserted to the king of Babylon and the rest of the artisans."
Jeremiah,52,16,But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and plowmen.
Jeremiah,52,17,"Now the bronze pillars which belonged to the house of the L ord and the stands and the bronze sea, which were in the house of the L ord , the Chaldeans broke in pieces and carried all their bronze to Babylon."
Jeremiah,52,18,"They also took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the basins, the pans and all the bronze vessels which were used in temple service."
Jeremiah,52,19,"The captain of the guard also took away the bowls, the firepans, the basins, the pots, the lampstands, the pans and the drink offering bowls, what was fine gold and what was fine silver."
Jeremiah,52,20,"The two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve bronze bulls that were under the sea, and the stands, which King Solomon had made for the house of the L ord —the bronze of all these vessels was beyond weight."
Jeremiah,52,21,"As for the pillars, the height of each pillar was eighteen cubits, and it was twelve cubits in circumference and four fingers in thickness, and hollow."
Jeremiah,52,22,"Now a capital of bronze was on it; and the height of each capital was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the capital all around, all of bronze. And the second pillar was like these, including pomegranates."
Jeremiah,52,23,There were ninety-six exposed pomegranates; all the pomegranates numbered a hundred on the network all around.
Jeremiah,52,24,"Then the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest and Zephaniah the second priest, with the three officers of the temple."
Jeremiah,52,25,"He also took from the city one official who was overseer of the men of war, and seven of the king’s advisers who were found in the city, and the scribe of the commander of the army who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the midst of the city."
Jeremiah,52,26,Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
Jeremiah,52,27,Then the king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was led away into exile from its land.
Jeremiah,52,28,"These are the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away into exile: in the seventh year 3,023 Jews;"
Jeremiah,52,29,in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar 832 persons from Jerusalem;
Jeremiah,52,30,"in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried into exile 745 Jewish people; there were 4,600 persons in all."
Jeremiah,52,31,"Now it came about in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, showed favor to Jehoiachin king of Judah and brought him out of prison."
Jeremiah,52,32,Then he spoke kindly to him and set his throne above the thrones of the kings who were with him in Babylon.
Jeremiah,52,33,"So Jehoiachin changed his prison clothes, and had his meals in the king’s presence regularly all the days of his life."
Jeremiah,52,34,"For his allowance, a regular allowance was given him by the king of Babylon, a daily portion all the days of his life until the day of his death."
