Nehemiah,1,1,"The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah. N ow it happened in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, while I was in Susa the capitol,"
Nehemiah,1,2,"that Hanani, one of my brothers, and some men from Judah came; and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped and had survived the captivity, and about Jerusalem."
Nehemiah,1,3,"They said to me, “The remnant there in the province who survived the captivity are in great distress and reproach, and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down and its gates are burned with fire.”"
Nehemiah,1,4,"When I heard these words, I sat down and wept and mourned for days; and I was fasting and praying before the God of heaven."
Nehemiah,1,5,"I said, “I beseech You, O L ord God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who preserves the covenant and lovingkindness for those who love Him and keep His commandments,"
Nehemiah,1,6,"let Your ear now be attentive and Your eyes open to hear the prayer of Your servant which I am praying before You now, day and night, on behalf of the sons of Israel Your servants, confessing the sins of the sons of Israel which we have sinned against You; I and my father’s house have sinned."
Nehemiah,1,7,"We have acted very corruptly against You and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances which You commanded Your servant Moses."
Nehemiah,1,8,"Remember the word which You commanded Your servant Moses, saying, ‘If you are unfaithful I will scatter you among the peoples;"
Nehemiah,1,9,"but if you return to Me and keep My commandments and do them, though those of you who have been scattered were in the most remote part of the heavens, I will gather them from there and will bring them to the place where I have chosen to cause My name to dwell.’"
Nehemiah,1,10,They are Your servants and Your people whom You redeemed by Your great power and by Your strong hand.
Nehemiah,1,11,"O Lord, I beseech You, may Your ear be attentive to the prayer of Your servant and the prayer of Your servants who delight to revere Your name, and make Your servant successful today and grant him compassion before this man.” N ow I was the cupbearer to the king."
Nehemiah,2,1,"And it came about in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, that wine was before him, and I took up the wine and gave it to the king. Now I had not been sad in his presence."
Nehemiah,2,2,"So the king said to me, “Why is your face sad though you are not sick? This is nothing but sadness of heart.” Then I was very much afraid."
Nehemiah,2,3,"I said to the king, “Let the king live forever. Why should my face not be sad when the city, the place of my fathers’ tombs, lies desolate and its gates have been consumed by fire?”"
Nehemiah,2,4,"Then the king said to me, “What would you request?” So I prayed to the God of heaven."
Nehemiah,2,5,"I said to the king, “If it please the king, and if your servant has found favor before you, send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers’ tombs, that I may rebuild it.”"
Nehemiah,2,6,"Then the king said to me, the queen sitting beside him, “How long will your journey be, and when will you return?” So it pleased the king to send me, and I gave him a definite time."
Nehemiah,2,7,"And I said to the king, “If it please the king, let letters be given me for the governors of the provinces beyond the River, that they may allow me to pass through until I come to Judah,"
Nehemiah,2,8,"and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king’s forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the fortress which is by the temple, for the wall of the city and for the house to which I will go.” And the king granted them to me because the good hand of my God was on me."
Nehemiah,2,9,Then I came to the governors of the provinces beyond the River and gave them the king’s letters. Now the king had sent with me officers of the army and horsemen.
Nehemiah,2,10,"When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about it, it was very displeasing to them that someone had come to seek the welfare of the sons of Israel."
Nehemiah,2,11,So I came to Jerusalem and was there three days.
Nehemiah,2,12,"And I arose in the night, I and a few men with me. I did not tell anyone what my God was putting into my mind to do for Jerusalem and there was no animal with me except the animal on which I was riding."
Nehemiah,2,13,"So I went out at night by the Valley Gate in the direction of the Dragon’s Well and on to the Refuse Gate, inspecting the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down and its gates which were consumed by fire."
Nehemiah,2,14,"Then I passed on to the Fountain Gate and the King’s Pool, but there was no place for my mount to pass."
Nehemiah,2,15,So I went up at night by the ravine and inspected the wall. Then I entered the Valley Gate again and returned.
Nehemiah,2,16,"The officials did not know where I had gone or what I had done; nor had I as yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the officials or the rest who did the work."
Nehemiah,2,17,"Then I said to them, “You see the bad situation we are in, that Jerusalem is desolate and its gates burned by fire. Come, let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem so that we will no longer be a reproach.”"
Nehemiah,2,18,"I told them how the hand of my God had been favorable to me and also about the king’s words which he had spoken to me. Then they said, “Let us arise and build.” So they put their hands to the good work."
Nehemiah,2,19,"But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab heard it, they mocked us and despised us and said, “What is this thing you are doing? Are you rebelling against the king?”"
Nehemiah,2,20,"So I answered them and said to them, “The God of heaven will give us success; therefore we His servants will arise and build, but you have no portion, right or memorial in Jerusalem.”"
Nehemiah,3,1,Then Eliashib the high priest arose with his brothers the priests and built the Sheep Gate; they consecrated it and hung its doors. They consecrated the wall to the Tower of the Hundred and the Tower of Hananel.
Nehemiah,3,2,"Next to him the men of Jericho built, and next to them Zaccur the son of Imri built."

Nehemiah,3,32,Between the upper room of the corner and the Sheep Gate the goldsmiths and the merchants carried out repairs.
Nehemiah,4,1,"Now it came about that when Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, he became furious and very angry and mocked the Jews."
Nehemiah,4,2,"He spoke in the presence of his brothers and the wealthy men of Samaria and said, “What are these feeble Jews doing? Are they going to restore it for themselves? Can they offer sacrifices? Can they finish in a day? Can they revive the stones from the dusty rubble even the burned ones?”"
Nehemiah,4,3,"Now Tobiah the Ammonite was near him and he said, “Even what they are building—if a fox should jump on it, he would break their stone wall down!”"
Nehemiah,4,4,"Hear, O our God, how we are despised! Return their reproach on their own heads and give them up for plunder in a land of captivity."
Nehemiah,4,5,"Do not forgive their iniquity and let not their sin be blotted out before You, for they have demoralized the builders."
Nehemiah,4,6,"So we built the wall and the whole wall was joined together to half its height, for the people had a mind to work."
Nehemiah,4,7,"Now when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites and the Ashdodites heard that the repair of the walls of Jerusalem went on, and that the breaches began to be closed, they were very angry."
Nehemiah,4,8,All of them conspired together to come and fight against Jerusalem and to cause a disturbance in it.
Nehemiah,4,9,"But we prayed to our God, and because of them we set up a guard against them day and night."
Nehemiah,4,10,"Thus in Judah it was said, “The strength of the burden bearers is failing, Yet there is much rubbish; And we ourselves are unable To rebuild the wall.”"
Nehemiah,4,11,"Our enemies said, “They will not know or see until we come among them, kill them and put a stop to the work.”"
Nehemiah,4,12,"When the Jews who lived near them came and told us ten times, “They will come up against us from every place where you may turn,”"
Nehemiah,4,13,"then I stationed men in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, the exposed places, and I stationed the people in families with their swords, spears and bows."
Nehemiah,4,14,"When I saw their fear, I rose and spoke to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people: “Do not be afraid of them; remember the Lord who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives and your houses.”"
Nehemiah,4,15,"When our enemies heard that it was known to us, and that God had frustrated their plan, then all of us returned to the wall, each one to his work."
Nehemiah,4,16,"From that day on, half of my servants carried on the work while half of them held the spears, the shields, the bows and the breastplates; and the captains were behind the whole house of Judah."
Nehemiah,4,17,Those who were rebuilding the wall and those who carried burdens took their load with one hand doing the work and the other holding a weapon.
Nehemiah,4,18,"As for the builders, each wore his sword girded at his side as he built, while the trumpeter stood near me."
Nehemiah,4,19,"I said to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, “The work is great and extensive, and we are separated on the wall far from one another."
Nehemiah,4,20,"At whatever place you hear the sound of the trumpet, rally to us there. Our God will fight for us.”"
Nehemiah,4,21,So we carried on the work with half of them holding spears from dawn until the stars appeared.
Nehemiah,4,22,"At that time I also said to the people, “Let each man with his servant spend the night within Jerusalem so that they may be a guard for us by night and a laborer by day.”"
Nehemiah,4,23,"So neither I, my brothers, my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us removed our clothes, each took his weapon even to the water."
Nehemiah,5,1,Now there was a great outcry of the people and of their wives against their Jewish brothers.
Nehemiah,5,2,"For there were those who said, “We, our sons and our daughters are many; therefore let us get grain that we may eat and live.”"
Nehemiah,5,3,"There were others who said, “We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards and our houses that we might get grain because of the famine.”"
Nehemiah,5,4,"Also there were those who said, “We have borrowed money for the king’s tax on our fields and our vineyards."
Nehemiah,5,5,"Now our flesh is like the flesh of our brothers, our children like their children. Yet behold, we are forcing our sons and our daughters to be slaves, and some of our daughters are forced into bondage already, and we are helpless because our fields and vineyards belong to others.”"
Nehemiah,5,6,Then I was very angry when I had heard their outcry and these words.
Nehemiah,5,7,"I consulted with myself and contended with the nobles and the rulers and said to them, “You are exacting usury, each from his brother!” Therefore, I held a great assembly against them."
Nehemiah,5,8,"I said to them, “We according to our ability have redeemed our Jewish brothers who were sold to the nations; now would you even sell your brothers that they may be sold to us?” Then they were silent and could not find a word to say."
Nehemiah,5,9,"Again I said, “The thing which you are doing is not good; should you not walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the nations, our enemies?"
Nehemiah,5,10,"And likewise I, my brothers and my servants are lending them money and grain. Please, let us leave off this usury."
Nehemiah,5,11,"Please, give back to them this very day their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money and of the grain, the new wine and the oil that you are exacting from them.”"
Nehemiah,5,12,"Then they said, “We will give it back and will require nothing from them; we will do exactly as you say.” So I called the priests and took an oath from them that they would do according to this promise."
Nehemiah,5,13,"I also shook out the front of my garment and said, “Thus may God shake out every man from his house and from his possessions who does not fulfill this promise; even thus may he be shaken out and emptied.” And all the assembly said, “Amen!” And they praised the L ord . Then the people did according to this promise."
Nehemiah,5,14,"Moreover, from the day that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year to the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes, for twelve years, neither I nor my kinsmen have eaten the governor’s food allowance."
Nehemiah,5,15,But the former governors who were before me laid burdens on the people and took from them bread and wine besides forty shekels of silver; even their servants domineered the people. But I did not do so because of the fear of God.
Nehemiah,5,16,"I also applied myself to the work on this wall; we did not buy any land, and all my servants were gathered there for the work."
Nehemiah,5,17,"Moreover, there were at my table one hundred and fifty Jews and officials, besides those who came to us from the nations that were around us."
Nehemiah,5,18,"Now that which was prepared for each day was one ox and six choice sheep, also birds were prepared for me; and once in ten days all sorts of wine were furnished in abundance. Yet for all this I did not demand the governor’s food allowance, because the servitude was heavy on this people."
Nehemiah,5,19,"Remember me, O my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people."
Nehemiah,6,1,"Now when it was reported to Sanballat, Tobiah, to Geshem the Arab and to the rest of our enemies that I had rebuilt the wall, and that no breach remained in it, although at that time I had not set up the doors in the gates,"
Nehemiah,6,2,"then Sanballat and Geshem sent a message to me, saying, “Come, let us meet together at Chephirim in the plain of Ono.” But they were planning to harm me."
Nehemiah,6,3,"So I sent messengers to them, saying, “I am doing a great work and I cannot come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and come down to you?”"
Nehemiah,6,4,"They sent messages to me four times in this manner, and I answered them in the same way."
Nehemiah,6,5,Then Sanballat sent his servant to me in the same manner a fifth time with an open letter in his hand.
Nehemiah,6,6,"In it was written, “It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu says, that you and the Jews are planning to rebel; therefore you are rebuilding the wall. And you are to be their king, according to these reports."
Nehemiah,6,7,"You have also appointed prophets to proclaim in Jerusalem concerning you, ‘A king is in Judah!’ And now it will be reported to the king according to these reports. So come now, let us take counsel together.”"
Nehemiah,6,8,"Then I sent a message to him saying, “Such things as you are saying have not been done, but you are inventing them in your own mind.”"
Nehemiah,6,9,"For all of them were trying to frighten us, thinking, “They will become discouraged with the work and it will not be done.” But now, O God, strengthen my hands."
Nehemiah,6,10,"When I entered the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabel, who was confined at home, he said, “Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple, for they are coming to kill you, and they are coming to kill you at night.”"
Nehemiah,6,11,"But I said, “Should a man like me flee? And could one such as I go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.”"
Nehemiah,6,12,"Then I perceived that surely God had not sent him, but he uttered his prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him."
Nehemiah,6,13,"He was hired for this reason, that I might become frightened and act accordingly and sin, so that they might have an evil report in order that they could reproach me."
Nehemiah,6,14,"Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these works of theirs, and also Noadiah the prophetess and the rest of the prophets who were trying to frighten me."
Nehemiah,6,15,"So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth of the month Elul, in fifty-two days."
Nehemiah,6,16,"When all our enemies heard of it, and all the nations surrounding us saw it, they lost their confidence; for they recognized that this work had been accomplished with the help of our God."
Nehemiah,6,17,"Also in those days many letters went from the nobles of Judah to Tobiah, and Tobiah’s letters came to them."
Nehemiah,6,18,"For many in Judah were bound by oath to him because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah."
Nehemiah,6,19,"Moreover, they were speaking about his good deeds in my presence and reported my words to him. Then Tobiah sent letters to frighten me."
Nehemiah,7,1,"Now when the wall was rebuilt and I had set up the doors, and the gatekeepers and the singers and the Levites were appointed,"
Nehemiah,7,2,"then I put Hanani my brother, and Hananiah the commander of the fortress, in charge of Jerusalem, for he was a faithful man and feared God more than many."
Nehemiah,7,3,"Then I said to them, “Do not let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot, and while they are standing guard, let them shut and bolt the doors. Also appoint guards from the inhabitants of Jerusalem, each at his post, and each in front of his own house.”"
Nehemiah,7,4,"Now the city was large and spacious, but the people in it were few and the houses were not built."
Nehemiah,7,5,"Then my God put it into my heart to assemble the nobles, the officials and the people to be enrolled by genealogies. Then I found the book of the genealogy of those who came up first in which I found the following record:"
Nehemiah,7,6,"These are the people of the province who came up from the captivity of the exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and who returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his city,"

Nehemiah,8,3,"He read from it before the square which was in front of the Water Gate from early morning until midday, in the presence of men and women, those who could understand; and all the people were attentive to the book of the law."
Nehemiah,8,4,"Ezra the scribe stood at a wooden podium which they had made for the purpose. And beside him stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah on his right hand; and Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah and Meshullam on his left hand."
Nehemiah,8,5,"Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people for he was standing above all the people; and when he opened it, all the people stood up."
Nehemiah,8,6,"Then Ezra blessed the L ord the great God. And all the people answered, “Amen, Amen!” while lifting up their hands; then they bowed low and worshiped the L ord with their faces to the ground."
Nehemiah,8,7,"Also Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, the Levites, explained the law to the people while the people remained in their place."
Nehemiah,8,8,"They read from the book, from the law of God, translating to give the sense so that they understood the reading."
Nehemiah,8,9,"Then Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who taught the people said to all the people, “This day is holy to the L ord your God; do not mourn or weep.” For all the people were weeping when they heard the words of the law."
Nehemiah,8,10,"Then he said to them, “Go, eat of the fat, drink of the sweet, and send portions to him who has nothing prepared; for this day is holy to our Lord. Do not be grieved, for the joy of the L ord is your strength.”"
Nehemiah,8,11,"So the Levites calmed all the people, saying, “Be still, for the day is holy; do not be grieved.”"
Nehemiah,8,12,"All the people went away to eat, to drink, to send portions and to celebrate a great festival, because they understood the words which had been made known to them."
Nehemiah,8,13,"Then on the second day the heads of fathers’ households of all the people, the priests and the Levites were gathered to Ezra the scribe that they might gain insight into the words of the law."
Nehemiah,8,14,They found written in the law how the L ord had commanded through Moses that the sons of Israel should live in booths during the feast of the seventh month.
Nehemiah,8,15,"So they proclaimed and circulated a proclamation in all their cities and in Jerusalem, saying, “Go out to the hills, and bring olive branches and wild olive branches, myrtle branches, palm branches and branches of other leafy trees, to make booths, as it is written.”"
Nehemiah,8,16,"So the people went out and brought them and made booths for themselves, each on his roof, and in their courts and in the courts of the house of God, and in the square at the Water Gate and in the square at the Gate of Ephraim."
Nehemiah,8,17,The entire assembly of those who had returned from the captivity made booths and lived in them. The sons of Israel had indeed not done so from the days of Joshua the son of Nun to that day. And there was great rejoicing.
Nehemiah,8,18,"He read from the book of the law of God daily, from the first day to the last day. And they celebrated the feast seven days, and on the eighth day there was a solemn assembly according to the ordinance."
Nehemiah,9,1,"Now on the twenty-fourth day of this month the sons of Israel assembled with fasting, in sackcloth and with dirt upon them."
Nehemiah,9,2,"The descendants of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners, and stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathers."
Nehemiah,9,3,"While they stood in their place, they read from the book of the law of the L ord their God for a fourth of the day; and for another fourth they confessed and worshiped the L ord their God."
Nehemiah,9,4,"Now on the Levites’ platform stood Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani and Chenani, and they cried with a loud voice to the L ord their God."
Nehemiah,9,5,"Then the Levites, Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah and Pethahiah, said, “Arise, bless the L ord your God forever and ever! O may Your glorious name be blessed And exalted above all blessing and praise!"
Nehemiah,9,6,"You alone are the L ord. You have made the heavens, The heaven of heavens with all their host, The earth and all that is on it, The seas and all that is in them. You give life to all of them And the heavenly host bows down before You."
Nehemiah,9,7,"You are the L ord God, Who chose Abram And brought him out from Ur of the Chaldees, And gave him the name Abraham."
Nehemiah,9,8,"You found his heart faithful before You, And made a covenant with him To give him the land of the Canaanite, Of the Hittite and the Amorite, Of the Perizzite, the Jebusite and the Girgashite— To give it to his descendants. And You have fulfilled Your promise, For You are righteous."
Nehemiah,9,9,"“You saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, And heard their cry by the Red Sea."
Nehemiah,9,10,"Then You performed signs and wonders against Pharaoh, Against all his servants and all the people of his land; For You knew that they acted arrogantly toward them, And made a name for Yourself as it is this day."
Nehemiah,9,11,"You divided the sea before them, So they passed through the midst of the sea on dry ground; And their pursuers You hurled into the depths, Like a stone into raging waters."
Nehemiah,9,12,"And with a pillar of cloud You led them by day, And with a pillar of fire by night To light for them the way In which they were to go."
Nehemiah,9,13,"Then You came down on Mount Sinai, And spoke with them from heaven; You gave them just ordinances and true laws, Good statutes and commandments."
Nehemiah,9,14,"So You made known to them Your holy sabbath, And laid down for them commandments, statutes and law, Through Your servant Moses."
Nehemiah,9,15,"You provided bread from heaven for them for their hunger, You brought forth water from a rock for them for their thirst, And You told them to enter in order to possess The land which You swore to give them."
Nehemiah,9,16,"“But they, our fathers, acted arrogantly; They became stubborn and would not listen to Your commandments."
Nehemiah,9,17,"They refused to listen, And did not remember Your wondrous deeds which You had performed among them; So they became stubborn and appointed a leader to return to their slavery in Egypt. But You are a God of forgiveness, Gracious and compassionate, Slow to anger and abounding in lovingkindness; And You did not forsake them."
Nehemiah,9,18,"Even when they made for themselves A calf of molten metal And said, ‘This is your God Who brought you up from Egypt,’ And committed great blasphemies,"
Nehemiah,9,19,"You, in Your great compassion, Did not forsake them in the wilderness; The pillar of cloud did not leave them by day, To guide them on their way, Nor the pillar of fire by night, to light for them the way in which they were to go."
Nehemiah,9,20,"You gave Your good Spirit to instruct them, Your manna You did not withhold from their mouth, And You gave them water for their thirst."
Nehemiah,9,21,"Indeed, forty years You provided for them in the wilderness and they were not in want; Their clothes did not wear out, nor did their feet swell."
Nehemiah,9,22,"You also gave them kingdoms and peoples, And allotted them to them as a boundary. They took possession of the land of Sihon the king of Heshbon And the land of Og the king of Bashan."
Nehemiah,9,23,"You made their sons numerous as the stars of heaven, And You brought them into the land Which You had told their fathers to enter and possess."
Nehemiah,9,24,"So their sons entered and possessed the land. And You subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, And You gave them into their hand, with their kings and the peoples of the land, To do with them as they desired."
Nehemiah,9,25,"They captured fortified cities and a fertile land. They took possession of houses full of every good thing, Hewn cisterns, vineyards, olive groves, Fruit trees in abundance. So they ate, were filled and grew fat, And reveled in Your great goodness."
Nehemiah,9,26,"“But they became disobedient and rebelled against You, And cast Your law behind their backs And killed Your prophets who had admonished them So that they might return to You, And they committed great blasphemies."
Nehemiah,9,27,"Therefore You delivered them into the hand of their oppressors who oppressed them, But when they cried to You in the time of their distress, You heard from heaven, and according to Your great compassion You gave them deliverers who delivered them from the hand of their oppressors."
Nehemiah,9,28,"But as soon as they had rest, they did evil again before You; Therefore You abandoned them to the hand of their enemies, so that they ruled over them. When they cried again to You, You heard from heaven, And many times You rescued them according to Your compassion,"
Nehemiah,9,29,"And admonished them in order to turn them back to Your law. Yet they acted arrogantly and did not listen to Your commandments but sinned against Your ordinances, By which if a man observes them he shall live. And they turned a stubborn shoulder and stiffened their neck, and would not listen."
Nehemiah,9,30,"However, You bore with them for many years, And admonished them by Your Spirit through Your prophets, Yet they would not give ear. Therefore You gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands."
Nehemiah,9,31,"Nevertheless, in Your great compassion You did not make an end of them or forsake them, For You are a gracious and compassionate God."
Nehemiah,9,32,"“Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who keeps covenant and lovingkindness, Do not let all the hardship seem insignificant before You, Which has come upon us, our kings, our princes, our priests, our prophets, our fathers and on all Your people, From the days of the kings of Assyria to this day."
Nehemiah,9,33,"However, You are just in all that has come upon us; For You have dealt faithfully, but we have acted wickedly."
Nehemiah,9,34,"For our kings, our leaders, our priests and our fathers have not kept Your law Or paid attention to Your commandments and Your admonitions with which You have admonished them."
Nehemiah,9,35,"But they, in their own kingdom, With Your great goodness which You gave them, With the broad and rich land which You set before them, Did not serve You or turn from their evil deeds."
Nehemiah,9,36,"Behold, we are slaves today, And as to the land which You gave to our fathers to eat of its fruit and its bounty, Behold, we are slaves in it."
Nehemiah,9,37,"Its abundant produce is for the kings Whom You have set over us because of our sins; They also rule over our bodies And over our cattle as they please, So we are in great distress."
Nehemiah,9,38,"“Now because of all this We are making an agreement in writing; And on the sealed document are the names of our leaders, our Levites and our priests.”"

Nehemiah,10,29,"are joining with their kinsmen, their nobles, and are taking on themselves a curse and an oath to walk in God’s law, which was given through Moses, God’s servant, and to keep and to observe all the commandments of G od our Lord, and His ordinances and His statutes;"
Nehemiah,10,30,and that we will not give our daughters to the peoples of the land or take their daughters for our sons.
Nehemiah,10,31,"As for the peoples of the land who bring wares or any grain on the sabbath day to sell, we will not buy from them on the sabbath or a holy day; and we will forego the crops the seventh year and the exaction of every debt."
Nehemiah,10,32,We also placed ourselves under obligation to contribute yearly one third of a shekel for the service of the house of our God:
Nehemiah,10,33,"for the showbread, for the continual grain offering, for the continual burnt offering, the sabbaths, the new moon, for the appointed times, for the holy things and for the sin offerings to make atonement for Israel, and all the work of the house of our God."
Nehemiah,10,34,"Likewise we cast lots for the supply of wood among the priests, the Levites and the people so that they might bring it to the house of our God, according to our fathers’ households, at fixed times annually, to burn on the altar of the L ord our God, as it is written in the law;"

Nehemiah,10,36,"and bring to the house of our God the firstborn of our sons and of our cattle, and the firstborn of our herds and our flocks as it is written in the law, for the priests who are ministering in the house of our God."
Nehemiah,10,37,"We will also bring the first of our dough, our contributions, the fruit of every tree, the new wine and the oil to the priests at the chambers of the house of our God, and the tithe of our ground to the Levites, for the Levites are they who receive the tithes in all the rural towns."

Nehemiah,10,39,"For the sons of Israel and the sons of Levi shall bring the contribution of the grain, the new wine and the oil to the chambers; there are the utensils of the sanctuary, the priests who are ministering, the gatekeepers and the singers. Thus we will not neglect the house of our God."
Nehemiah,11,1,"Now the leaders of the people lived in Jerusalem, but the rest of the people cast lots to bring one out of ten to live in Jerusalem, the holy city, while nine-tenths remained in the other cities."

Nehemiah,11,24,"Pethahiah the son of Meshezabel, of the sons of Zerah the son of Judah, was the king’s representative in all matters concerning the people."

Nehemiah,12,26,"These served in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and of Ezra the priest and scribe."
Nehemiah,12,27,"Now at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought out the Levites from all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem so that they might celebrate the dedication with gladness, with hymns of thanksgiving and with songs to the accompaniment of cymbals, harps and lyres."
Nehemiah,12,28,"So the sons of the singers were assembled from the district around Jerusalem, and from the villages of the Netophathites,"
Nehemiah,12,29,"from Beth-gilgal and from their fields in Geba and Azmaveth, for the singers had built themselves villages around Jerusalem."
Nehemiah,12,30,"The priests and the Levites purified themselves; they also purified the people, the gates and the wall."
Nehemiah,12,31,"Then I had the leaders of Judah come up on top of the wall, and I appointed two great choirs, the first proceeding to the right on top of the wall toward the Refuse Gate."
Nehemiah,12,32,"Hoshaiah and half of the leaders of Judah followed them,"
Nehemiah,12,33,"with Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam,"
Nehemiah,12,34,"Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah,"
Nehemiah,12,35,"and some of the sons of the priests with trumpets; and Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph,"
Nehemiah,12,36,"and his kinsmen, Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah and Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God. And Ezra the scribe went before them."
Nehemiah,12,37,At the Fountain Gate they went directly up the steps of the city of David by the stairway of the wall above the house of David to the Water Gate on the east.
Nehemiah,12,38,"The second choir proceeded to the left, while I followed them with half of the people on the wall, above the Tower of Furnaces, to the Broad Wall,"
Nehemiah,12,39,"and above the Gate of Ephraim, by the Old Gate, by the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel and the Tower of the Hundred, as far as the Sheep Gate; and they stopped at the Gate of the Guard."
Nehemiah,12,40,Then the two choirs took their stand in the house of God. So did I and half of the officials with me;
Nehemiah,12,41,"and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah and Hananiah, with the trumpets;"
Nehemiah,12,42,"and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam and Ezer. And the singers sang, with Jezrahiah their leader,"
Nehemiah,12,43,"and on that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced because God had given them great joy, even the women and children rejoiced, so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard from afar."
Nehemiah,12,44,"On that day men were also appointed over the chambers for the stores, the contributions, the first fruits and the tithes, to gather into them from the fields of the cities the portions required by the law for the priests and Levites; for Judah rejoiced over the priests and Levites who served."
Nehemiah,12,45,"For they performed the worship of their God and the service of purification, together with the singers and the gatekeepers in accordance with the command of David and of his son Solomon."
Nehemiah,12,46,"For in the days of David and Asaph, in ancient times, there were leaders of the singers, songs of praise and hymns of thanksgiving to God."
Nehemiah,12,47,"So all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah gave the portions due the singers and the gatekeepers as each day required, and set apart the consecrated portion for the Levites, and the Levites set apart the consecrated portion for the sons of Aaron."
Nehemiah,13,1,"On that day they read aloud from the book of Moses in the hearing of the people; and there was found written in it that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever enter the assembly of God,"
Nehemiah,13,2,"because they did not meet the sons of Israel with bread and water, but hired Balaam against them to curse them. However, our God turned the curse into a blessing."
Nehemiah,13,3,"So when they heard the law, they excluded all foreigners from Israel."
Nehemiah,13,4,"Now prior to this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God, being related to Tobiah,"
Nehemiah,13,5,"had prepared a large room for him, where formerly they put the grain offerings, the frankincense, the utensils and the tithes of grain, wine and oil prescribed for the Levites, the singers and the gatekeepers, and the contributions for the priests."
Nehemiah,13,6,"But during all this time I was not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I had gone to the king. After some time, however, I asked leave from the king,"
Nehemiah,13,7,"and I came to Jerusalem and learned about the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, by preparing a room for him in the courts of the house of God."
Nehemiah,13,8,"It was very displeasing to me, so I threw all of Tobiah’s household goods out of the room."
Nehemiah,13,9,Then I gave an order and they cleansed the rooms; and I returned there the utensils of the house of God with the grain offerings and the frankincense.
Nehemiah,13,10,"I also discovered that the portions of the Levites had not been given them, so that the Levites and the singers who performed the service had gone away, each to his own field."
