Daniel,1,1,"In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it."
Daniel,1,2,"The Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, along with some of the vessels of the house of God; and he brought them to the land of Shinar, to the house of his god, and he brought the vessels into the treasury of his god."
Daniel,1,3,"Then the king ordered Ashpenaz, the chief of his officials, to bring in some of the sons of Israel, including some of the royal family and of the nobles,"
Daniel,1,4,"youths in whom was no defect, who were good-looking, showing intelligence in every branch of wisdom, endowed with understanding and discerning knowledge, and who had ability for serving in the king’s court; and he ordered him to teach them the literature and language of the Chaldeans."
Daniel,1,5,"The king appointed for them a daily ration from the king’s choice food and from the wine which he drank, and appointed that they should be educated three years, at the end of which they were to enter the king’s personal service."
Daniel,1,6,"Now among them from the sons of Judah were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah."
Daniel,1,7,"Then the commander of the officials assigned new names to them; and to Daniel he assigned the name Belteshazzar, to Hananiah Shadrach, to Mishael Meshach and to Azariah Abed-nego."
Daniel,1,8,But Daniel made up his mind that he would not defile himself with the king’s choice food or with the wine which he drank; so he sought permission from the commander of the officials that he might not defile himself.
Daniel,1,9,"Now God granted Daniel favor and compassion in the sight of the commander of the officials,"
Daniel,1,10,"and the commander of the officials said to Daniel, “I am afraid of my lord the king, who has appointed your food and your drink; for why should he see your faces looking more haggard than the youths who are your own age? Then you would make me forfeit my head to the king.”"
Daniel,1,11,"But Daniel said to the overseer whom the commander of the officials had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah,"
Daniel,1,12,"“Please test your servants for ten days, and let us be given some vegetables to eat and water to drink."
Daniel,1,13,Then let our appearance be observed in your presence and the appearance of the youths who are eating the king’s choice food; and deal with your servants according to what you see.”
Daniel,1,14,So he listened to them in this matter and tested them for ten days.
Daniel,1,15,At the end of ten days their appearance seemed better and they were fatter than all the youths who had been eating the king’s choice food.
Daniel,1,16,"So the overseer continued to withhold their choice food and the wine they were to drink, and kept giving them vegetables."
Daniel,1,17,"As for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and intelligence in every branch of literature and wisdom; Daniel even understood all kinds of visions and dreams."
Daniel,1,18,"Then at the end of the days which the king had specified for presenting them, the commander of the officials presented them before Nebuchadnezzar."
Daniel,1,19,"The king talked with them, and out of them all not one was found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah; so they entered the king’s personal service."
Daniel,1,20,"As for every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king consulted them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and conjurers who were in all his realm."
Daniel,1,21,And Daniel continued until the first year of Cyrus the king.
Daniel,2,1,"Now in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; and his spirit was troubled and his sleep left him."
Daniel,2,2,"Then the king gave orders to call in the magicians, the conjurers, the sorcerers and the Chaldeans to tell the king his dreams. So they came in and stood before the king."
Daniel,2,3,"The king said to them, “I had a dream and my spirit is anxious to understand the dream.”"
Daniel,2,4,"Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic: “O king, live forever! Tell the dream to your servants, and we will declare the interpretation.”"
Daniel,2,5,"The king replied to the Chaldeans, “The command from me is firm: if you do not make known to me the dream and its interpretation, you will be torn limb from limb and your houses will be made a rubbish heap."
Daniel,2,6,"But if you declare the dream and its interpretation, you will receive from me gifts and a reward and great honor; therefore declare to me the dream and its interpretation.”"
Daniel,2,7,"They answered a second time and said, “Let the king tell the dream to his servants, and we will declare the interpretation.”"
Daniel,2,8,"The king replied, “I know for certain that you are bargaining for time, inasmuch as you have seen that the command from me is firm,"
Daniel,2,9,"that if you do not make the dream known to me, there is only one decree for you. For you have agreed together to speak lying and corrupt words before me until the situation is changed; therefore tell me the dream, that I may know that you can declare to me its interpretation.”"
Daniel,2,10,"The Chaldeans answered the king and said, “There is not a man on earth who could declare the matter for the king, inasmuch as no great king or ruler has ever asked anything like this of any magician, conjurer or Chaldean."
Daniel,2,11,"Moreover, the thing which the king demands is difficult, and there is no one else who could declare it to the king except gods, whose dwelling place is not with mortal flesh.”"
Daniel,2,12,Because of this the king became indignant and very furious and gave orders to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.
Daniel,2,13,So the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they looked for Daniel and his friends to kill them.
Daniel,2,14,"Then Daniel replied with discretion and discernment to Arioch, the captain of the king’s bodyguard, who had gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon;"
Daniel,2,15,"he said to Arioch, the king’s commander, “For what reason is the decree from the king so urgent?” Then Arioch informed Daniel about the matter."
Daniel,2,16,"So Daniel went in and requested of the king that he would give him time, in order that he might declare the interpretation to the king."
Daniel,2,17,"Then Daniel went to his house and informed his friends, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, about the matter,"
Daniel,2,18,"so that they might request compassion from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that Daniel and his friends would not be destroyed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon."
Daniel,2,19,Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven;
Daniel,2,20,"Daniel said, “Let the name of God be blessed forever and ever, For wisdom and power belong to Him."
Daniel,2,21,It is He who changes the times and the epochs; He removes kings and establishes kings; He gives wisdom to wise men And knowledge to men of understanding.
Daniel,2,22,"It is He who reveals the profound and hidden things; He knows what is in the darkness, And the light dwells with Him."
Daniel,2,23,"To You, O God of my fathers, I give thanks and praise, For You have given me wisdom and power; Even now You have made known to me what we requested of You, For You have made known to us the king’s matter.”"
Daniel,2,24,"Therefore, Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and spoke to him as follows: “Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon! Take me into the king’s presence, and I will declare the interpretation to the king.”"
Daniel,2,25,Then Arioch hurriedly brought Daniel into the king’s presence and spoke to him as follows: “I have found a man among the exiles from Judah who can make the interpretation known to the king!”
Daniel,2,26,"The king said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, “Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen and its interpretation?”"
Daniel,2,27,"Daniel answered before the king and said, “As for the mystery about which the king has inquired, neither wise men, conjurers, magicians nor diviners are able to declare it to the king."
Daniel,2,28,"However, there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and He has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will take place in the latter days. This was your dream and the visions in your mind while on your bed."
Daniel,2,29,"As for you, O king, while on your bed your thoughts turned to what would take place in the future; and He who reveals mysteries has made known to you what will take place."
Daniel,2,30,"But as for me, this mystery has not been revealed to me for any wisdom residing in me more than in any other living man, but for the purpose of making the interpretation known to the king, and that you may understand the thoughts of your mind."
Daniel,2,31,"“You, O king, were looking and behold, there was a single great statue; that statue, which was large and of extraordinary splendor, was standing in front of you, and its appearance was awesome."
Daniel,2,32,"The head of that statue was made of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of bronze,"
Daniel,2,33,"its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay."
Daniel,2,34,"You continued looking until a stone was cut out without hands, and it struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and crushed them."
Daniel,2,35,"Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were crushed all at the same time and became like chaff from the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away so that not a trace of them was found. But the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain and filled the whole earth."
Daniel,2,36,“This was the dream; now we will tell its interpretation before the king.
Daniel,2,37,"You, O king, are the king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, the strength and the glory;"
Daniel,2,38,"and wherever the sons of men dwell, or the beasts of the field, or the birds of the sky, He has given them into your hand and has caused you to rule over them all. You are the head of gold."
Daniel,2,39,"After you there will arise another kingdom inferior to you, then another third kingdom of bronze, which will rule over all the earth."
Daniel,2,40,"Then there will be a fourth kingdom as strong as iron; inasmuch as iron crushes and shatters all things, so, like iron that breaks in pieces, it will crush and break all these in pieces."
Daniel,2,41,"In that you saw the feet and toes, partly of potter’s clay and partly of iron, it will be a divided kingdom; but it will have in it the toughness of iron, inasmuch as you saw the iron mixed with common clay."
Daniel,2,42,"As the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of pottery, so some of the kingdom will be strong and part of it will be brittle."
Daniel,2,43,"And in that you saw the iron mixed with common clay, they will combine with one another in the seed of men; but they will not adhere to one another, even as iron does not combine with pottery."
Daniel,2,44,"In the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which will never be destroyed, and that kingdom will not be left for another people; it will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms, but it will itself endure forever."
Daniel,2,45,"Inasmuch as you saw that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that it crushed the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold, the great God has made known to the king what will take place in the future; so the dream is true and its interpretation is trustworthy.”"
Daniel,2,46,"Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face and did homage to Daniel, and gave orders to present to him an offering and fragrant incense."
Daniel,2,47,"The king answered Daniel and said, “Surely your God is a God of gods and a Lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries, since you have been able to reveal this mystery.”"
Daniel,2,48,"Then the king promoted Daniel and gave him many great gifts, and he made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon."
Daniel,2,49,"And Daniel made request of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego over the administration of the province of Babylon, while Daniel was at the king’s court."
Daniel,3,1,"Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, the height of which was sixty cubits and its width six cubits; he set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon."
Daniel,3,2,"Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent word to assemble the satraps, the prefects and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates and all the rulers of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up."
Daniel,3,3,"Then the satraps, the prefects and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates and all the rulers of the provinces were assembled for the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up."
Daniel,3,4,"Then the herald loudly proclaimed: “To you the command is given, O peoples, nations and men of every language,"
Daniel,3,5,"that at the moment you hear the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery, bagpipe and all kinds of music, you are to fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up."
Daniel,3,6,But whoever does not fall down and worship shall immediately be cast into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire.”
Daniel,3,7,"Therefore at that time, when all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery, bagpipe and all kinds of music, all the peoples, nations and men of every language fell down and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up."
Daniel,3,8,For this reason at that time certain Chaldeans came forward and brought charges against the Jews.
Daniel,3,9,"They responded and said to Nebuchadnezzar the king: “O king, live forever!"
Daniel,3,10,"You, O king, have made a decree that every man who hears the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery, and bagpipe and all kinds of music, is to fall down and worship the golden image."
Daniel,3,11,But whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire.
Daniel,3,12,"There are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the administration of the province of Babylon, namely Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego. These men, O king, have disregarded you; they do not serve your gods or worship the golden image which you have set up.”"
Daniel,3,13,"Then Nebuchadnezzar in rage and anger gave orders to bring Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego; then these men were brought before the king."
Daniel,3,14,"Nebuchadnezzar responded and said to them, “Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the golden image that I have set up?"
Daniel,3,15,"Now if you are ready, at the moment you hear the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery and bagpipe and all kinds of music, to fall down and worship the image that I have made, very well. But if you do not worship, you will immediately be cast into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire; and what god is there who can deliver you out of my hands?”"
Daniel,3,16,"Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego replied to the king, “O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to give you an answer concerning this matter."
Daniel,3,17,"If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the furnace of blazing fire; and He will deliver us out of your hand, O king."
Daniel,3,18,"But even if He does not, let it be known to you, O king, that we are not going to serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up.”"
Daniel,3,19,"Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with wrath, and his facial expression was altered toward Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego. He answered by giving orders to heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated."
Daniel,3,20,"He commanded certain valiant warriors who were in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego in order to cast them into the furnace of blazing fire."
Daniel,3,21,"Then these men were tied up in their trousers, their coats, their caps and their other clothes, and were cast into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire."
Daniel,3,22,"For this reason, because the king’s command was urgent and the furnace had been made extremely hot, the flame of the fire slew those men who carried up Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego."
Daniel,3,23,"But these three men, Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, fell into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire still tied up."
Daniel,3,24,"Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astounded and stood up in haste; he said to his high officials, “Was it not three men we cast bound into the midst of the fire?” They replied to the king, “Certainly, O king.”"
Daniel,3,25,"He said, “Look! I see four men loosed and walking about in the midst of the fire without harm, and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods!”"
Daniel,3,26,"Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the door of the furnace of blazing fire; he responded and said, “Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, come out, you servants of the Most High God, and come here!” Then Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego came out of the midst of the fire."
Daniel,3,27,"The satraps, the prefects, the governors and the king’s high officials gathered around and saw in regard to these men that the fire had no effect on the bodies of these men nor was the hair of their head singed, nor were their trousers damaged, nor had the smell of fire even come upon them."
Daniel,3,28,"Nebuchadnezzar responded and said, “Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, who has sent His angel and delivered His servants who put their trust in Him, violating the king’s command, and yielded up their bodies so as not to serve or worship any god except their own God."
Daniel,3,29,"Therefore I make a decree that any people, nation or tongue that speaks anything offensive against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego shall be torn limb from limb and their houses reduced to a rubbish heap, inasmuch as there is no other god who is able to deliver in this way.”"
Daniel,3,30,"Then the king caused Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego to prosper in the province of Babylon."
Daniel,4,1,"Nebuchadnezzar the king to all the peoples, nations, and men of every language that live in all the earth: “May your peace abound!"
Daniel,4,2,It has seemed good to me to declare the signs and wonders which the Most High God has done for me.
Daniel,4,3,How great are His signs And how mighty are His wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom And His dominion is from generation to generation.
Daniel,4,4,"“I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at ease in my house and flourishing in my palace."
Daniel,4,5,I saw a dream and it made me fearful; and these fantasies as I lay on my bed and the visions in my mind kept alarming me.
Daniel,4,6,"So I gave orders to bring into my presence all the wise men of Babylon, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream."
Daniel,4,7,"Then the magicians, the conjurers, the Chaldeans and the diviners came in and I related the dream to them, but they could not make its interpretation known to me."
Daniel,4,8,"But finally Daniel came in before me, whose name is Belteshazzar according to the name of my god, and in whom is a spirit of the holy gods; and I related the dream to him, saying,"
Daniel,4,9,"‘O Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, since I know that a spirit of the holy gods is in you and no mystery baffles you, tell me the visions of my dream which I have seen, along with its interpretation."
Daniel,4,10,"‘Now these were the visions in my mind as I lay on my bed: I was looking, and behold, there was a tree in the midst of the earth and its height was great."
Daniel,4,11,"The tree grew large and became strong And its height reached to the sky, And it was visible to the end of the whole earth."
Daniel,4,12,"Its foliage was beautiful and its fruit abundant, And in it was food for all. The beasts of the field found shade under it, And the birds of the sky dwelt in its branches, And all living creatures fed themselves from it."
Daniel,4,13,"‘I was looking in the visions in my mind as I lay on my bed, and behold, an angelic watcher, a holy one, descended from heaven."
Daniel,4,14,"He shouted out and spoke as follows: “Chop down the tree and cut off its branches, Strip off its foliage and scatter its fruit; Let the beasts flee from under it And the birds from its branches."
Daniel,4,15,"Yet leave the stump with its roots in the ground, But with a band of iron and bronze around it In the new grass of the field; And let him be drenched with the dew of heaven, And let him share with the beasts in the grass of the earth."
Daniel,4,16,"Let his mind be changed from that of a man And let a beast’s mind be given to him, And let seven periods of time pass over him."
Daniel,4,17,"This sentence is by the decree of the angelic watchers And the decision is a command of the holy ones, In order that the living may know That the Most High is ruler over the realm of mankind, And bestows it on whom He wishes And sets over it the lowliest of men.”"
Daniel,4,18,"This is the dream which I, King Nebuchadnezzar, have seen. Now you, Belteshazzar, tell me its interpretation, inasmuch as none of the wise men of my kingdom is able to make known to me the interpretation; but you are able, for a spirit of the holy gods is in you.’"
Daniel,4,19,"“Then Daniel, whose name is Belteshazzar, was appalled for a while as his thoughts alarmed him. The king responded and said, ‘Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or its interpretation alarm you.’ Belteshazzar replied, ‘My lord, if only the dream applied to those who hate you and its interpretation to your adversaries!"
Daniel,4,20,"The tree that you saw, which became large and grew strong, whose height reached to the sky and was visible to all the earth"
Daniel,4,21,"and whose foliage was beautiful and its fruit abundant, and in which was food for all, under which the beasts of the field dwelt and in whose branches the birds of the sky lodged—"
Daniel,4,22,"it is you, O king; for you have become great and grown strong, and your majesty has become great and reached to the sky and your dominion to the end of the earth."
Daniel,4,23,"In that the king saw an angelic watcher, a holy one, descending from heaven and saying, “Chop down the tree and destroy it; yet leave the stump with its roots in the ground, but with a band of iron and bronze around it in the new grass of the field, and let him be drenched with the dew of heaven, and let him share with the beasts of the field until seven periods of time pass over him,”"
Daniel,4,24,"this is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the Most High, which has come upon my lord the king:"
Daniel,4,25,"that you be driven away from mankind and your dwelling place be with the beasts of the field, and you be given grass to eat like cattle and be drenched with the dew of heaven; and seven periods of time will pass over you, until you recognize that the Most High is ruler over the realm of mankind and bestows it on whomever He wishes."
Daniel,4,26,"And in that it was commanded to leave the stump with the roots of the tree, your kingdom will be assured to you after you recognize that it is Heaven that rules."
Daniel,4,27,"Therefore, O king, may my advice be pleasing to you: break away now from your sins by doing righteousness and from your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor, in case there may be a prolonging of your prosperity.’"
Daniel,4,28,“All this happened to Nebuchadnezzar the king.
Daniel,4,29,Twelve months later he was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon.
Daniel,4,30,"The king reflected and said, ‘Is this not Babylon the great, which I myself have built as a royal residence by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?’"
Daniel,4,31,"While the word was in the king’s mouth, a voice came from heaven, saying, ‘King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is declared: sovereignty has been removed from you,"
Daniel,4,32,"and you will be driven away from mankind, and your dwelling place will be with the beasts of the field. You will be given grass to eat like cattle, and seven periods of time will pass over you until you recognize that the Most High is ruler over the realm of mankind and bestows it on whomever He wishes.’"
Daniel,4,33,"Immediately the word concerning Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled; and he was driven away from mankind and began eating grass like cattle, and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven until his hair had grown like eagles’ feathers and his nails like birds’ claws."
Daniel,4,34,"“But at the end of that period, I, Nebuchadnezzar, raised my eyes toward heaven and my reason returned to me, and I blessed the Most High and praised and honored Him who lives forever; For His dominion is an everlasting dominion, And His kingdom endures from generation to generation."
Daniel,4,35,"All the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing, But He does according to His will in the host of heaven And among the inhabitants of earth; And no one can ward off His hand Or say to Him, ‘What have You done?’"
Daniel,4,36,"At that time my reason returned to me. And my majesty and splendor were restored to me for the glory of my kingdom, and my counselors and my nobles began seeking me out; so I was reestablished in my sovereignty, and surpassing greatness was added to me."
Daniel,4,37,"Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise, exalt and honor the King of heaven, for all His works are true and His ways just, and He is able to humble those who walk in pride.”"
Daniel,5,1,"Belshazzar the king held a great feast for a thousand of his nobles, and he was drinking wine in the presence of the thousand."
Daniel,5,2,"When Belshazzar tasted the wine, he gave orders to bring the gold and silver vessels which Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem, so that the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines might drink from them."
Daniel,5,3,"Then they brought the gold vessels that had been taken out of the temple, the house of God which was in Jerusalem; and the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines drank from them."
Daniel,5,4,"They drank the wine and praised the gods of gold and silver, of bronze, iron, wood and stone."
Daniel,5,5,"Suddenly the fingers of a man’s hand emerged and began writing opposite the lampstand on the plaster of the wall of the king’s palace, and the king saw the back of the hand that did the writing."
Daniel,5,6,"Then the king’s face grew pale and his thoughts alarmed him, and his hip joints went slack and his knees began knocking together."
Daniel,5,7,"The king called aloud to bring in the conjurers, the Chaldeans and the diviners. The king spoke and said to the wise men of Babylon, “Any man who can read this inscription and explain its interpretation to me shall be clothed with purple and have a necklace of gold around his neck, and have authority as third ruler in the kingdom.”"
Daniel,5,8,"Then all the king’s wise men came in, but they could not read the inscription or make known its interpretation to the king."
Daniel,5,9,"Then King Belshazzar was greatly alarmed, his face grew even paler, and his nobles were perplexed."
Daniel,5,10,"The queen entered the banquet hall because of the words of the king and his nobles; the queen spoke and said, “O king, live forever! Do not let your thoughts alarm you or your face be pale."
Daniel,5,11,"There is a man in your kingdom in whom is a spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of your father, illumination, insight and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods were found in him. And King Nebuchadnezzar, your father, your father the king, appointed him chief of the magicians, conjurers, Chaldeans and diviners."
Daniel,5,12,"This was because an extraordinary spirit, knowledge and insight, interpretation of dreams, explanation of enigmas and solving of difficult problems were found in this Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Let Daniel now be summoned and he will declare the interpretation.”"
Daniel,5,13,"Then Daniel was brought in before the king. The king spoke and said to Daniel, “Are you that Daniel who is one of the exiles from Judah, whom my father the king brought from Judah?"
Daniel,5,14,"Now I have heard about you that a spirit of the gods is in you, and that illumination, insight and extraordinary wisdom have been found in you."
Daniel,5,15,"Just now the wise men and the conjurers were brought in before me that they might read this inscription and make its interpretation known to me, but they could not declare the interpretation of the message."
Daniel,5,16,"But I personally have heard about you, that you are able to give interpretations and solve difficult problems. Now if you are able to read the inscription and make its interpretation known to me, you will be clothed with purple and wear a necklace of gold around your neck, and you will have authority as the third ruler in the kingdom.”"
Daniel,5,17,"Then Daniel answered and said before the king, “Keep your gifts for yourself or give your rewards to someone else; however, I will read the inscription to the king and make the interpretation known to him."
Daniel,5,18,"O king, the Most High God granted sovereignty, grandeur, glory and majesty to Nebuchadnezzar your father."
Daniel,5,19,"Because of the grandeur which He bestowed on him, all the peoples, nations and men of every language feared and trembled before him; whomever he wished he killed and whomever he wished he spared alive; and whomever he wished he elevated and whomever he wished he humbled."
Daniel,5,20,"But when his heart was lifted up and his spirit became so proud that he behaved arrogantly, he was deposed from his royal throne and his glory was taken away from him."
Daniel,5,21,"He was also driven away from mankind, and his heart was made like that of beasts, and his dwelling place was with the wild donkeys. He was given grass to eat like cattle, and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven until he recognized that the Most High God is ruler over the realm of mankind and that He sets over it whomever He wishes."
Daniel,5,22,"Yet you, his son, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, even though you knew all this,"
Daniel,5,23,"but you have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of His house before you, and you and your nobles, your wives and your concubines have been drinking wine from them; and you have praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood and stone, which do not see, hear or understand. But the God in whose hand are your life-breath and all your ways, you have not glorified."
Daniel,5,24,Then the hand was sent from Him and this inscription was written out.
Daniel,5,25,"“Now this is the inscription that was written out: ‘MENĒ, MENĒ, TEKĒL, UPHARSIN.’"
Daniel,5,26,This is the interpretation of the message: ‘MENĒ’—God has numbered your kingdom and put an end to it.
Daniel,5,27,‘TEKĒL’—you have been weighed on the scales and found deficient.
Daniel,5,28,‘PERĒS’—your kingdom has been divided and given over to the Medes and Persians.”
Daniel,5,29,"Then Belshazzar gave orders, and they clothed Daniel with purple and put a necklace of gold around his neck, and issued a proclamation concerning him that he now had authority as the third ruler in the kingdom."
Daniel,5,30,That same night Belshazzar the Chaldean king was slain.
Daniel,5,31,So Darius the Mede received the kingdom at about the age of sixty-two.
Daniel,6,1,"It seemed good to Darius to appoint 120 satraps over the kingdom, that they would be in charge of the whole kingdom,"
Daniel,6,2,"and over them three commissioners (of whom Daniel was one), that these satraps might be accountable to them, and that the king might not suffer loss."
Daniel,6,3,"Then this Daniel began distinguishing himself among the commissioners and satraps because he possessed an extraordinary spirit, and the king planned to appoint him over the entire kingdom."
Daniel,6,4,"Then the commissioners and satraps began trying to find a ground of accusation against Daniel in regard to government affairs; but they could find no ground of accusation or evidence of corruption, inasmuch as he was faithful, and no negligence or corruption was to be found in him."
Daniel,6,5,"Then these men said, “We will not find any ground of accusation against this Daniel unless we find it against him with regard to the law of his God.”"
Daniel,6,6,"Then these commissioners and satraps came by agreement to the king and spoke to him as follows: “King Darius, live forever!"
Daniel,6,7,"All the commissioners of the kingdom, the prefects and the satraps, the high officials and the governors have consulted together that the king should establish a statute and enforce an injunction that anyone who makes a petition to any god or man besides you, O king, for thirty days, shall be cast into the lions’ den."
Daniel,6,8,"Now, O king, establish the injunction and sign the document so that it may not be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which may not be revoked.”"
Daniel,6,9,"Therefore King Darius signed the document, that is, the injunction."
Daniel,6,10,"Now when Daniel knew that the document was signed, he entered his house (now in his roof chamber he had windows open toward Jerusalem); and he continued kneeling on his knees three times a day, praying and giving thanks before his God, as he had been doing previously."
Daniel,6,11,Then these men came by agreement and found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God.
Daniel,6,12,"Then they approached and spoke before the king about the king’s injunction, “Did you not sign an injunction that any man who makes a petition to any god or man besides you, O king, for thirty days, is to be cast into the lions’ den?” The king replied, “The statement is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which may not be revoked.”"
Daniel,6,13,"Then they answered and spoke before the king, “Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, O king, or to the injunction which you signed, but keeps making his petition three times a day.”"
Daniel,6,14,"Then, as soon as the king heard this statement, he was deeply distressed and set his mind on delivering Daniel; and even until sunset he kept exerting himself to rescue him."
Daniel,6,15,"Then these men came by agreement to the king and said to the king, “Recognize, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no injunction or statute which the king establishes may be changed.”"
Daniel,6,16,"Then the king gave orders, and Daniel was brought in and cast into the lions’ den. The king spoke and said to Daniel, “Your God whom you constantly serve will Himself deliver you.”"
Daniel,6,17,"A stone was brought and laid over the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the signet rings of his nobles, so that nothing would be changed in regard to Daniel."
Daniel,6,18,"Then the king went off to his palace and spent the night fasting, and no entertainment was brought before him; and his sleep fled from him."
Daniel,6,19,"Then the king arose at dawn, at the break of day, and went in haste to the lions’ den."
Daniel,6,20,"When he had come near the den to Daniel, he cried out with a troubled voice. The king spoke and said to Daniel, “Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you constantly serve, been able to deliver you from the lions?”"
Daniel,6,21,"Then Daniel spoke to the king, “O king, live forever!"
Daniel,6,22,"My God sent His angel and shut the lions’ mouths and they have not harmed me, inasmuch as I was found innocent before Him; and also toward you, O king, I have committed no crime.”"
Daniel,6,23,"Then the king was very pleased and gave orders for Daniel to be taken up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den and no injury whatever was found on him, because he had trusted in his God."
Daniel,6,24,"The king then gave orders, and they brought those men who had maliciously accused Daniel, and they cast them, their children and their wives into the lions’ den; and they had not reached the bottom of the den before the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones."
Daniel,6,25,"Then Darius the king wrote to all the peoples, nations and men of every language who were living in all the land: “May your peace abound!"
Daniel,6,26,"I make a decree that in all the dominion of my kingdom men are to fear and tremble before the God of Daniel; For He is the living God and enduring forever, And His kingdom is one which will not be destroyed, And His dominion will be forever."
Daniel,6,27,"He delivers and rescues and performs signs and wonders In heaven and on earth, Who has also delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.”"
Daniel,6,28,So this Daniel enjoyed success in the reign of Darius and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
Daniel,7,1,In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel saw a dream and visions in his mind as he lay on his bed; then he wrote the dream down and related the following summary of it.
Daniel,7,2,"Daniel said, “I was looking in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea."
Daniel,7,3,"And four great beasts were coming up from the sea, different from one another."
Daniel,7,4,"The first was like a lion and had the wings of an eagle. I kept looking until its wings were plucked, and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a man; a human mind also was given to it."
Daniel,7,5,"And behold, another beast, a second one, resembling a bear. And it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth; and thus they said to it, ‘Arise, devour much meat!’"
Daniel,7,6,"After this I kept looking, and behold, another one, like a leopard, which had on its back four wings of a bird; the beast also had four heads, and dominion was given to it."
Daniel,7,7,"After this I kept looking in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, dreadful and terrifying and extremely strong; and it had large iron teeth. It devoured and crushed and trampled down the remainder with its feet; and it was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns."
Daniel,7,8,"While I was contemplating the horns, behold, another horn, a little one, came up among them, and three of the first horns were pulled out by the roots before it; and behold, this horn possessed eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth uttering great boasts."
Daniel,7,9,"“I kept looking Until thrones were set up, And the Ancient of Days took His seat; His vesture was like white snow And the hair of His head like pure wool. His throne was ablaze with flames, Its wheels were a burning fire."
Daniel,7,10,"A river of fire was flowing And coming out from before Him; Thousands upon thousands were attending Him, And myriads upon myriads were standing before Him; The court sat, And the books were opened."
Daniel,7,11,"Then I kept looking because of the sound of the boastful words which the horn was speaking; I kept looking until the beast was slain, and its body was destroyed and given to the burning fire."
Daniel,7,12,"As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but an extension of life was granted to them for an appointed period of time."
Daniel,7,13,"“I kept looking in the night visions, And behold, with the clouds of heaven One like a Son of Man was coming, And He came up to the Ancient of Days And was presented before Him."
Daniel,7,14,"And to Him was given dominion, Glory and a kingdom, That all the peoples, nations and men of every language Might serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion Which will not pass away; And His kingdom is one Which will not be destroyed."
Daniel,7,15,"“As for me, Daniel, my spirit was distressed within me, and the visions in my mind kept alarming me."
Daniel,7,16,I approached one of those who were standing by and began asking him the exact meaning of all this. So he told me and made known to me the interpretation of these things:
Daniel,7,17,"‘These great beasts, which are four in number, are four kings who will arise from the earth."
Daniel,7,18,"But the saints of the Highest One will receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever, for all ages to come.’"
Daniel,7,19,"“Then I desired to know the exact meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others, exceedingly dreadful, with its teeth of iron and its claws of bronze, and which devoured, crushed and trampled down the remainder with its feet,"
Daniel,7,20,"and the meaning of the ten horns that were on its head and the other horn which came up, and before which three of them fell, namely, that horn which had eyes and a mouth uttering great boasts and which was larger in appearance than its associates."
Daniel,7,21,"I kept looking, and that horn was waging war with the saints and overpowering them"
Daniel,7,22,"until the Ancient of Days came and judgment was passed in favor of the saints of the Highest One, and the time arrived when the saints took possession of the kingdom."
Daniel,7,23,"“Thus he said: ‘The fourth beast will be a fourth kingdom on the earth, which will be different from all the other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth and tread it down and crush it."
Daniel,7,24,"As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings will arise; and another will arise after them, and he will be different from the previous ones and will subdue three kings."
Daniel,7,25,"He will speak out against the Most High and wear down the saints of the Highest One, and he will intend to make alterations in times and in law; and they will be given into his hand for a time, times, and half a time."
Daniel,7,26,"But the court will sit for judgment, and his dominion will be taken away, annihilated and destroyed forever."
Daniel,7,27,"Then the sovereignty, the dominion and the greatness of all the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be given to the people of the saints of the Highest One; His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all the dominions will serve and obey Him.’"
Daniel,7,28,"“At this point the revelation ended. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts were greatly alarming me and my face grew pale, but I kept the matter to myself.”"
Daniel,8,1,"In the third year of the reign of Belshazzar the king a vision appeared to me, Daniel, subsequent to the one which appeared to me previously."
Daniel,8,2,"I looked in the vision, and while I was looking I was in the citadel of Susa, which is in the province of Elam; and I looked in the vision and I myself was beside the Ulai Canal."
Daniel,8,3,"Then I lifted my eyes and looked, and behold, a ram which had two horns was standing in front of the canal. Now the two horns were long, but one was longer than the other, with the longer one coming up last."
Daniel,8,4,"I saw the ram butting westward, northward, and southward, and no other beasts could stand before him nor was there anyone to rescue from his power, but he did as he pleased and magnified himself."
Daniel,8,5,"While I was observing, behold, a male goat was coming from the west over the surface of the whole earth without touching the ground; and the goat had a conspicuous horn between his eyes."
Daniel,8,6,"He came up to the ram that had the two horns, which I had seen standing in front of the canal, and rushed at him in his mighty wrath."
Daniel,8,7,"I saw him come beside the ram, and he was enraged at him; and he struck the ram and shattered his two horns, and the ram had no strength to withstand him. So he hurled him to the ground and trampled on him, and there was none to rescue the ram from his power."
Daniel,8,8,"Then the male goat magnified himself exceedingly. But as soon as he was mighty, the large horn was broken; and in its place there came up four conspicuous horns toward the four winds of heaven."
Daniel,8,9,"Out of one of them came forth a rather small horn which grew exceedingly great toward the south, toward the east, and toward the Beautiful Land."
Daniel,8,10,"It grew up to the host of heaven and caused some of the host and some of the stars to fall to the earth, and it trampled them down."
Daniel,8,11,"It even magnified itself to be equal with the Commander of the host; and it removed the regular sacrifice from Him, and the place of His sanctuary was thrown down."
Daniel,8,12,And on account of transgression the host will be given over to the horn along with the regular sacrifice; and it will fling truth to the ground and perform its will and prosper.
Daniel,8,13,"Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to that particular one who was speaking, “How long will the vision about the regular sacrifice apply, while the transgression causes horror, so as to allow both the holy place and the host to be trampled?”"
Daniel,8,14,"He said to me, “For 2,300 evenings and mornings; then the holy place will be properly restored.”"
Daniel,8,15,"When I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought to understand it; and behold, standing before me was one who looked like a man."
Daniel,8,16,"And I heard the voice of a man between the banks of Ulai, and he called out and said, “Gabriel, give this man an understanding of the vision.”"
Daniel,8,17,"So he came near to where I was standing, and when he came I was frightened and fell on my face; but he said to me, “Son of man, understand that the vision pertains to the time of the end.”"
Daniel,8,18,"Now while he was talking with me, I sank into a deep sleep with my face to the ground; but he touched me and made me stand upright."
Daniel,8,19,"He said, “Behold, I am going to let you know what will occur at the final period of the indignation, for it pertains to the appointed time of the end."
Daniel,8,20,The ram which you saw with the two horns represents the kings of Media and Persia.
Daniel,8,21,"The shaggy goat represents the kingdom of Greece, and the large horn that is between his eyes is the first king."
Daniel,8,22,"The broken horn and the four horns that arose in its place represent four kingdoms which will arise from his nation, although not with his power."
Daniel,8,23,"In the latter period of their rule, When the transgressors have run their course, A king will arise, Insolent and skilled in intrigue."
Daniel,8,24,"His power will be mighty, but not by his own power, And he will destroy to an extraordinary degree And prosper and perform his will; He will destroy mighty men and the holy people."
Daniel,8,25,"And through his shrewdness He will cause deceit to succeed by his influence; And he will magnify himself in his heart, And he will destroy many while they are at ease. He will even oppose the Prince of princes, But he will be broken without human agency."
Daniel,8,26,"The vision of the evenings and mornings Which has been told is true; But keep the vision secret, For it pertains to many days in the future. ”"
Daniel,8,27,"Then I, Daniel, was exhausted and sick for days. Then I got up again and carried on the king’s business; but I was astounded at the vision, and there was none to explain it."
Daniel,9,1,"In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of Median descent, who was made king over the kingdom of the Chaldeans—"
Daniel,9,2,"in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, observed in the books the number of the years which was revealed as the word of the L ord to Jeremiah the prophet for the completion of the desolations of Jerusalem, namely, seventy years."
Daniel,9,3,"So I gave my attention to the Lord God to seek Him by prayer and supplications, with fasting, sackcloth and ashes."
Daniel,9,4,"I prayed to the L ord my God and confessed and said, “Alas, O Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps His covenant and lovingkindness for those who love Him and keep His commandments,"
Daniel,9,5,"we have sinned, committed iniquity, acted wickedly and rebelled, even turning aside from Your commandments and ordinances."
Daniel,9,6,"Moreover, we have not listened to Your servants the prophets, who spoke in Your name to our kings, our princes, our fathers and all the people of the land."
Daniel,9,7,"“Righteousness belongs to You, O Lord, but to us open shame, as it is this day—to the men of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem and all Israel, those who are nearby and those who are far away in all the countries to which You have driven them, because of their unfaithful deeds which they have committed against You."
Daniel,9,8,"Open shame belongs to us, O Lord, to our kings, our princes and our fathers, because we have sinned against You."
Daniel,9,9,"To the Lord our God belong compassion and forgiveness, for we have rebelled against Him;"
Daniel,9,10,"nor have we obeyed the voice of the L ord our God, to walk in His teachings which He set before us through His servants the prophets."
Daniel,9,11,"Indeed all Israel has transgressed Your law and turned aside, not obeying Your voice; so the curse has been poured out on us, along with the oath which is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, for we have sinned against Him."
Daniel,9,12,"Thus He has confirmed His words which He had spoken against us and against our rulers who ruled us, to bring on us great calamity; for under the whole heaven there has not been done anything like what was done to Jerusalem."
Daniel,9,13,"As it is written in the law of Moses, all this calamity has come on us; yet we have not sought the favor of the L ord our God by turning from our iniquity and giving attention to Your truth."
Daniel,9,14,"Therefore the L ord has kept the calamity in store and brought it on us; for the L ord our God is righteous with respect to all His deeds which He has done, but we have not obeyed His voice."
Daniel,9,15,"“And now, O Lord our God, who have brought Your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and have made a name for Yourself, as it is this day—we have sinned, we have been wicked."
Daniel,9,16,"O Lord, in accordance with all Your righteous acts, let now Your anger and Your wrath turn away from Your city Jerusalem, Your holy mountain; for because of our sins and the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and Your people have become a reproach to all those around us."
Daniel,9,17,"So now, our God, listen to the prayer of Your servant and to his supplications, and for Your sake, O Lord, let Your face shine on Your desolate sanctuary."
Daniel,9,18,"O my God, incline Your ear and hear! Open Your eyes and see our desolations and the city which is called by Your name; for we are not presenting our supplications before You on account of any merits of our own, but on account of Your great compassion."
Daniel,9,19,"O Lord, hear! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, listen and take action! For Your own sake, O my God, do not delay, because Your city and Your people are called by Your name.”"
Daniel,9,20,"Now while I was speaking and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the L ord my God in behalf of the holy mountain of my God,"
Daniel,9,21,"while I was still speaking in prayer, then the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision previously, came to me in my extreme weariness about the time of the evening offering."
Daniel,9,22,"He gave me instruction and talked with me and said, “O Daniel, I have now come forth to give you insight with understanding."
Daniel,9,23,"At the beginning of your supplications the command was issued, and I have come to tell you, for you are highly esteemed; so give heed to the message and gain understanding of the vision."
Daniel,9,24,"“Seventy weeks have been decreed for your people and your holy city, to finish the transgression, to make an end of sin, to make atonement for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy place."
Daniel,9,25,"So you are to know and discern that from the issuing of a decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until Messiah the Prince there will be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks; it will be built again, with plaza and moat, even in times of distress."
Daniel,9,26,"Then after the sixty-two weeks the Messiah will be cut off and have nothing, and the people of the prince who is to come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. And its end will come with a flood; even to the end there will be war; desolations are determined."
Daniel,9,27,"And he will make a firm covenant with the many for one week, but in the middle of the week he will put a stop to sacrifice and grain offering; and on the wing of abominations will come one who makes desolate, even until a complete destruction, one that is decreed, is poured out on the one who makes desolate.”"
Daniel,10,1,"In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a message was revealed to Daniel, who was named Belteshazzar; and the message was true and one of great conflict, but he understood the message and had an understanding of the vision."
Daniel,10,2,"In those days, I, Daniel, had been mourning for three entire weeks."
Daniel,10,3,"I did not eat any tasty food, nor did meat or wine enter my mouth, nor did I use any ointment at all until the entire three weeks were completed."
Daniel,10,4,"On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, while I was by the bank of the great river, that is, the Tigris,"
Daniel,10,5,"I lifted my eyes and looked, and behold, there was a certain man dressed in linen, whose waist was girded with a belt of pure gold of Uphaz."
Daniel,10,6,"His body also was like beryl, his face had the appearance of lightning, his eyes were like flaming torches, his arms and feet like the gleam of polished bronze, and the sound of his words like the sound of a tumult."
Daniel,10,7,"Now I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, while the men who were with me did not see the vision; nevertheless, a great dread fell on them, and they ran away to hide themselves."
Daniel,10,8,"So I was left alone and saw this great vision; yet no strength was left in me, for my natural color turned to a deathly pallor, and I retained no strength."
Daniel,10,9,"But I heard the sound of his words; and as soon as I heard the sound of his words, I fell into a deep sleep on my face, with my face to the ground."
Daniel,10,10,"Then behold, a hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees."
Daniel,10,11,"He said to me, “O Daniel, man of high esteem, understand the words that I am about to tell you and stand upright, for I have now been sent to you.” And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood up trembling."
Daniel,10,12,"Then he said to me, “Do not be afraid, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart on understanding this and on humbling yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come in response to your words."
Daniel,10,13,"But the prince of the kingdom of Persia was withstanding me for twenty-one days; then behold, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, for I had been left there with the kings of Persia."
Daniel,10,14,"Now I have come to give you an understanding of what will happen to your people in the latter days, for the vision pertains to the days yet future. ”"
Daniel,10,15,"When he had spoken to me according to these words, I turned my face toward the ground and became speechless."
Daniel,10,16,"And behold, one who resembled a human being was touching my lips; then I opened my mouth and spoke and said to him who was standing before me, “O my lord, as a result of the vision anguish has come upon me, and I have retained no strength."
Daniel,10,17,"For how can such a servant of my lord talk with such as my lord? As for me, there remains just now no strength in me, nor has any breath been left in me.”"
Daniel,10,18,Then this one with human appearance touched me again and strengthened me.
Daniel,10,19,"He said, “O man of high esteem, do not be afraid. Peace be with you; take courage and be courageous!” Now as soon as he spoke to me, I received strength and said, “May my lord speak, for you have strengthened me.”"
Daniel,10,20,"Then he said, “Do you understand why I came to you? But I shall now return to fight against the prince of Persia; so I am going forth, and behold, the prince of Greece is about to come."
Daniel,10,21,"However, I will tell you what is inscribed in the writing of truth. Yet there is no one who stands firmly with me against these forces except Michael your prince."
Daniel,11,1,"“In the first year of Darius the Mede, I arose to be an encouragement and a protection for him."
Daniel,11,2,"And now I will tell you the truth. Behold, three more kings are going to arise in Persia. Then a fourth will gain far more riches than all of them; as soon as he becomes strong through his riches, he will arouse the whole empire against the realm of Greece."
Daniel,11,3,"And a mighty king will arise, and he will rule with great authority and do as he pleases."
Daniel,11,4,"But as soon as he has arisen, his kingdom will be broken up and parceled out toward the four points of the compass, though not to his own descendants, nor according to his authority which he wielded, for his sovereignty will be uprooted and given to others besides them."
Daniel,11,5,"“Then the king of the South will grow strong, along with one of his princes who will gain ascendancy over him and obtain dominion; his domain will be a great dominion indeed."
Daniel,11,6,"After some years they will form an alliance, and the daughter of the king of the South will come to the king of the North to carry out a peaceful arrangement. But she will not retain her position of power, nor will he remain with his power, but she will be given up, along with those who brought her in and the one who sired her as well as he who supported her in those times."
Daniel,11,7,"But one of the descendants of her line will arise in his place, and he will come against their army and enter the fortress of the king of the North, and he will deal with them and display great strength."
Daniel,11,8,"Also their gods with their metal images and their precious vessels of silver and gold he will take into captivity to Egypt, and he on his part will refrain from attacking the king of the North for some years."
Daniel,11,9,"Then the latter will enter the realm of the king of the South, but will return to his own land."
Daniel,11,10,"“His sons will mobilize and assemble a multitude of great forces; and one of them will keep on coming and overflow and pass through, that he may again wage war up to his very fortress."
Daniel,11,11,"The king of the South will be enraged and go forth and fight with the king of the North. Then the latter will raise a great multitude, but that multitude will be given into the hand of the former."
Daniel,11,12,"When the multitude is carried away, his heart will be lifted up, and he will cause tens of thousands to fall; yet he will not prevail."
Daniel,11,13,"For the king of the North will again raise a greater multitude than the former, and after an interval of some years he will press on with a great army and much equipment."
Daniel,11,14,"“Now in those times many will rise up against the king of the South; the violent ones among your people will also lift themselves up in order to fulfill the vision, but they will fall down."
Daniel,11,15,"Then the king of the North will come, cast up a siege ramp and capture a well-fortified city; and the forces of the South will not stand their ground, not even their choicest troops, for there will be no strength to make a stand."
Daniel,11,16,"But he who comes against him will do as he pleases, and no one will be able to withstand him; he will also stay for a time in the Beautiful Land, with destruction in his hand."
Daniel,11,17,"He will set his face to come with the power of his whole kingdom, bringing with him a proposal of peace which he will put into effect; he will also give him the daughter of women to ruin it. But she will not take a stand for him or be on his side."
Daniel,11,18,"Then he will turn his face to the coastlands and capture many. But a commander will put a stop to his scorn against him; moreover, he will repay him for his scorn."
Daniel,11,19,"So he will turn his face toward the fortresses of his own land, but he will stumble and fall and be found no more."
Daniel,11,20,"“Then in his place one will arise who will send an oppressor through the Jewel of his kingdom; yet within a few days he will be shattered, though not in anger nor in battle."
Daniel,11,21,"In his place a despicable person will arise, on whom the honor of kingship has not been conferred, but he will come in a time of tranquility and seize the kingdom by intrigue."
Daniel,11,22,"The overflowing forces will be flooded away before him and shattered, and also the prince of the covenant."
Daniel,11,23,"After an alliance is made with him he will practice deception, and he will go up and gain power with a small force of people."
Daniel,11,24,"In a time of tranquility he will enter the richest parts of the realm, and he will accomplish what his fathers never did, nor his ancestors; he will distribute plunder, booty and possessions among them, and he will devise his schemes against strongholds, but only for a time."
Daniel,11,25,"He will stir up his strength and courage against the king of the South with a large army; so the king of the South will mobilize an extremely large and mighty army for war; but he will not stand, for schemes will be devised against him."
Daniel,11,26,"Those who eat his choice food will destroy him, and his army will overflow, but many will fall down slain."
Daniel,11,27,"As for both kings, their hearts will be intent on evil, and they will speak lies to each other at the same table; but it will not succeed, for the end is still to come at the appointed time."
Daniel,11,28,"Then he will return to his land with much plunder; but his heart will be set against the holy covenant, and he will take action and then return to his own land."
Daniel,11,29,"“At the appointed time he will return and come into the South, but this last time it will not turn out the way it did before."
Daniel,11,30,For ships of Kittim will come against him; therefore he will be disheartened and will return and become enraged at the holy covenant and take action; so he will come back and show regard for those who forsake the holy covenant.
Daniel,11,31,"Forces from him will arise, desecrate the sanctuary fortress, and do away with the regular sacrifice. And they will set up the abomination of desolation."
Daniel,11,32,"By smooth words he will turn to godlessness those who act wickedly toward the covenant, but the people who know their God will display strength and take action."
Daniel,11,33,"Those who have insight among the people will give understanding to the many; yet they will fall by sword and by flame, by captivity and by plunder for many days."
Daniel,11,34,"Now when they fall they will be granted a little help, and many will join with them in hypocrisy."
Daniel,11,35,"Some of those who have insight will fall, in order to refine, purge and make them pure until the end time; because it is still to come at the appointed time."
Daniel,11,36,"“Then the king will do as he pleases, and he will exalt and magnify himself above every god and will speak monstrous things against the God of gods; and he will prosper until the indignation is finished, for that which is decreed will be done."
Daniel,11,37,"He will show no regard for the gods of his fathers or for the desire of women, nor will he show regard for any other god; for he will magnify himself above them all."
Daniel,11,38,"But instead he will honor a god of fortresses, a god whom his fathers did not know; he will honor him with gold, silver, costly stones and treasures."
Daniel,11,39,"He will take action against the strongest of fortresses with the help of a foreign god; he will give great honor to those who acknowledge him and will cause them to rule over the many, and will parcel out land for a price."
Daniel,11,40,"“At the end time the king of the South will collide with him, and the king of the North will storm against him with chariots, with horsemen and with many ships; and he will enter countries, overflow them and pass through."
Daniel,11,41,"He will also enter the Beautiful Land, and many countries will fall; but these will be rescued out of his hand: Edom, Moab and the foremost of the sons of Ammon."
Daniel,11,42,"Then he will stretch out his hand against other countries, and the land of Egypt will not escape."
Daniel,11,43,But he will gain control over the hidden treasures of gold and silver and over all the precious things of Egypt; and Libyans and Ethiopians will follow at his heels.
Daniel,11,44,"But rumors from the East and from the North will disturb him, and he will go forth with great wrath to destroy and annihilate many."
Daniel,11,45,"He will pitch the tents of his royal pavilion between the seas and the beautiful Holy Mountain; yet he will come to his end, and no one will help him."
Daniel,12,1,"“Now at that time Michael, the great prince who stands guard over the sons of your people, will arise. And there will be a time of distress such as never occurred since there was a nation until that time; and at that time your people, everyone who is found written in the book, will be rescued."
Daniel,12,2,"Many of those who sleep in the dust of the ground will awake, these to everlasting life, but the others to disgrace and everlasting contempt."
Daniel,12,3,"Those who have insight will shine brightly like the brightness of the expanse of heaven, and those who lead the many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever."
Daniel,12,4,"But as for you, Daniel, conceal these words and seal up the book until the end of time; many will go back and forth, and knowledge will increase.”"
Daniel,12,5,"Then I, Daniel, looked and behold, two others were standing, one on this bank of the river and the other on that bank of the river."
Daniel,12,6,"And one said to the man dressed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, “How long will it be until the end of these wonders?”"
Daniel,12,7,"I heard the man dressed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, as he raised his right hand and his left toward heaven, and swore by Him who lives forever that it would be for a time, times, and half a time; and as soon as they finish shattering the power of the holy people, all these events will be completed."
Daniel,12,8,"As for me, I heard but could not understand; so I said, “My lord, what will be the outcome of these events? ”"
Daniel,12,9,"He said, “Go your way, Daniel, for these words are concealed and sealed up until the end time."
Daniel,12,10,"Many will be purged, purified and refined, but the wicked will act wickedly; and none of the wicked will understand, but those who have insight will understand."
Daniel,12,11,"From the time that the regular sacrifice is abolished and the abomination of desolation is set up, there will be 1,290 days."
Daniel,12,12,"How blessed is he who keeps waiting and attains to the 1,335 days!"
Daniel,12,13,"But as for you, go your way to the end; then you will enter into rest and rise again for your allotted portion at the end of the age.”"
