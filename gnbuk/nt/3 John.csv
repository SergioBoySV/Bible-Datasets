3 John,1,1," From the Elder — To my dear Gaius, whom I truly love."
3 John,1,2,"My dear friend, I pray that everything may go well with you and that you may be in good health — as I know you are well in spirit."
3 John,1,3,I was so happy when some fellow-Christians arrived and told me how faithful you are to the truth — just as you always live in the truth.
3 John,1,4,Nothing makes me happier than to hear that my children live in the truth.
3 John,1,5,"My dear friend, you are so faithful in the work you do for your fellow-Christians, even when they are strangers."
3 John,1,6,They have spoken to the church here about your love. Please help them to continue their journey in a way that will please God.
3 John,1,7,For they set out on their journey in the service of Christ without accepting any help from unbelievers.
3 John,1,8,"We Christians, then, must help these people, so that we may share in their work for the truth."
3 John,1,9,"I wrote a short letter to the church; but Diotrephes, who likes to be their leader, will not pay any attention to what I say."
3 John,1,10,"When I come, then, I will call attention to everything he has done: the terrible things he says about us and the lies he tells! But that is not enough for him; he will not receive our fellow-Christians when they come, and even stops those who want to receive them and tries to drive them out of the church!"
3 John,1,11,"My dear friend, do not imitate what is bad, but imitate what is good. Whoever does good belongs to God; whoever does what is bad has not seen God."
3 John,1,12,"Everyone speaks well of Demetrius; truth itself speaks well of him. And we add our testimony, and you know that what we say is true."
3 John,1,13,"I have so much to tell you, but I do not want to do it with pen and ink."
3 John,1,14,"I hope to see you soon, and then we will talk personally."
3 John,1,15,Peace be with you. All your friends send greetings. Greet all our friends personally.
