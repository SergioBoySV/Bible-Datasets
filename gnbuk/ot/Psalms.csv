Psalms,78,22,because they had no faith in him and did not believe that he would save them.
Psalms,78,23,But he spoke to the sky above and commanded its doors to open;
Psalms,78,24," he gave them grain from heaven, by sending down manna for them to eat."
Psalms,78,25,"So they ate the food of angels, and God gave them all they wanted."
Psalms,78,26,"He also caused the east wind to blow, and by his power he stirred up the south wind;"

Psalms,78,37,They were not loyal to him; they were not faithful to their covenant with him.
Psalms,78,38,But God was merciful to his people. He forgave their sin and did not destroy them. Many times he held back his anger and restrained his fury.
Psalms,78,39,"He remembered that they were only mortal beings, like a wind that blows by and is gone."
