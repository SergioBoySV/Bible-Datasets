Song of Songs,1,1," The most beautiful of songs, by Solomon."
Song of Songs,1,2,Your lips cover me with kisses; your love is better than wine.
Song of Songs,1,3,There is a fragrance about you; the sound of your name recalls it. No woman could help loving you.
Song of Songs,1,4,"Take me with you, and we'll run away; be my king and take me to your room. We will be happy together, drink deep, and lose ourselves in love. No wonder all women love you!"
Song of Songs,1,5,"Women of Jerusalem, I am dark but beautiful, dark as the desert tents of Kedar, but beautiful as the curtains in Solomon's palace."
Song of Songs,1,6,"Don't look down on me because of my colour, because the sun has tanned me. My brothers were angry with me and made me work in the vineyard. I had no time to care for myself."
Song of Songs,1,7,"Tell me, my love, Where will you lead your flock to graze? Where will they rest from the noonday sun? Why should I need to look for you among the flocks of the other shepherds?"
Song of Songs,1,8,"Don't you know the place, loveliest of women? Go and follow the flock; find pasture for your goats near the tents of the shepherds."
Song of Songs,1,9,"You, my love, excite men as a mare excites the stallions of Pharaoh's chariots."
Song of Songs,1,10,Your hair is beautiful upon your cheeks and falls along your neck like jewels.
Song of Songs,1,11,But we will make for you a chain of gold with ornaments of silver.
Song of Songs,1,12,"My king was lying on his couch, and my perfume filled the air with fragrance."
Song of Songs,1,13,My lover has the scent of myrrh as he lies upon my breasts.
Song of Songs,1,14,My lover is like the wild flowers that bloom in the vineyards at Engedi.
Song of Songs,1,15,"How beautiful you are, my love; how your eyes shine with love!"
Song of Songs,1,16,"How handsome you are, my dearest; how you delight me! The green grass will be our bed;"
Song of Songs,1,17,"the cedars will be the beams of our house, and the cypress trees the ceiling."
Song of Songs,2,1,"I am only a wild flower in Sharon, a lily in a mountain valley."
Song of Songs,2,2,Like a lily among thorns is my darling among women.
Song of Songs,2,3,"Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest, so is my dearest compared with other men. I love to sit in its shadow, and its fruit is sweet to my taste."
Song of Songs,2,4,He brought me to his banqueting hall and raised the banner of love over me.
Song of Songs,2,5,Restore my strength with raisins and refresh me with apples! I am weak from passion.
Song of Songs,2,6,"His left hand is under my head, and his right hand caresses me."
Song of Songs,2,7,"Promise me, women of Jerusalem; swear by the swift deer and the gazelles that you will not interrupt our love."
Song of Songs,2,8,"I hear my lover's voice. He comes running over the mountains, racing across the hills to me."
Song of Songs,2,9,"My lover is like a gazelle, like a young stag. There he stands beside the wall. He looks in through the window and glances through the lattice."
Song of Songs,2,10,"My lover speaks to me. Come then, my love; my darling, come with me."
Song of Songs,2,11,The winter is over; the rains have stopped;
Song of Songs,2,12,in the countryside the flowers are in bloom. This is the time for singing; the song of doves is heard in the fields.
Song of Songs,2,13,"Figs are beginning to ripen; the air is fragrant with blossoming vines. Come then, my love; my darling, come with me."
Song of Songs,2,14,You are like a dove that hides in the crevice of a rock. Let me see your lovely face and hear your enchanting voice.
Song of Songs,2,15,"Catch the foxes, the little foxes, before they ruin our vineyard in bloom."
Song of Songs,2,16,"My lover is mine, and I am his. He feeds his flock among the lilies"
Song of Songs,2,17,"until the morning breezes blow and the darkness disappears. Return, my darling, like a gazelle, like a stag on the mountains of Bether."
Song of Songs,3,1,"Asleep on my bed, night after night I dreamt of the one I love; I was looking for him, but couldn't find him."
Song of Songs,3,2,"I went wandering through the city, through its streets and alleys. I looked for the one I love. I looked, but couldn't find him."
Song of Songs,3,3,"The watchmen patrolling the city saw me. I asked them, “Have you found my lover?”"
Song of Songs,3,4,"As soon as I left them, I found him. I held him and wouldn't let him go until I took him to my mother's house, to the room where I was born."
Song of Songs,3,5,"Promise me, women of Jerusalem; swear by the swift deer and the gazelles that you will not interrupt our love."
Song of Songs,3,6,"What is this coming from the desert like a column of smoke, fragrant with incense and myrrh, the incense sold by the traders?"
Song of Songs,3,7,"Solomon is coming, carried on his throne; sixty soldiers form the bodyguard, the finest soldiers in Israel."
Song of Songs,3,8,"All of them are skilful with the sword; they are battle-hardened veterans. Each of them is armed with a sword, on guard against a night attack."

Song of Songs,3,10,"Its posts are covered with silver; over it is cloth embroidered with gold. Its cushions are covered with purple cloth, lovingly woven by the women of Jerusalem."
Song of Songs,3,11,"Women of Zion, come and see King Solomon. He is wearing the crown that his mother placed on his head on his wedding day, on the day of his gladness and joy."
Song of Songs,4,1,"How beautiful you are, my love! How your eyes shine with love behind your veil. Your hair dances, like a flock of goats bounding down the hills of Gilead."
Song of Songs,4,2,Your teeth are as white as sheep that have just been shorn and washed. Not one of them is missing; they are all perfectly matched.
Song of Songs,4,3,Your lips are like a scarlet ribbon; how lovely they are when you speak. Your cheeks glow behind your veil.

Song of Songs,4,12,"My sweetheart, my bride, is a secret garden, a walled garden, a private spring;"
Song of Songs,4,13,"there the plants flourish. They grow like an orchard of pomegranate trees and bear the finest fruits. There is no lack of henna and nard,"
Song of Songs,4,14,"of saffron, calamus, and cinnamon, or incense of every kind. Myrrh and aloes grow there with all the most fragrant perfumes."
Song of Songs,4,15,"Fountains water the garden, streams of flowing water, brooks gushing down from the Lebanon Mountains."
Song of Songs,4,16,"Wake up, North Wind. South Wind, blow on my garden; fill the air with fragrance. Let my lover come to his garden and eat the best of its fruits."
Song of Songs,5,1,"I have entered my garden, my sweetheart, my bride. I am gathering my spices and myrrh; I am eating my honey and honeycomb; I am drinking my wine and milk. Eat, lovers, and drink until you are drunk with love!"
Song of Songs,5,2,"While I slept, my heart was awake. I dreamt my lover knocked at the door. Let me come in, my darling, my sweetheart, my dove. My head is wet with dew, and my hair is damp from the mist."
Song of Songs,5,3,I have already undressed; why should I get dressed again? I have washed my feet; why should I get them dirty again?
Song of Songs,5,4,"My lover put his hand to the door, and I was thrilled that he was near."

Song of Songs,6,4,"My love, you are as beautiful as Jerusalem, as lovely as the city of Tirzah, as breathtaking as these great cities."
Song of Songs,6,5,"Turn your eyes away from me; they are holding me captive. Your hair dances, like a flock of goats bounding down the hills of Gilead."

Song of Songs,6,11,"I have come down among the almond trees to see the young plants in the valley, to see the new leaves on the vines and the blossoms on the pomegranate trees."
Song of Songs,6,12,I am trembling; you have made me as eager for love as a chariot driver is for battle.
Song of Songs,6,13,"Dance, dance, girl of Shulam. Let us watch you as you dance. Why do you want to watch me as I dance between the rows of onlookers?"
Song of Songs,7,1,What a wonderful woman you are! How beautiful are your feet in sandals. The curve of your thighs is like the work of an artist.

Song of Songs,7,3,"Your breasts are like twin deer, like two gazelles."
Song of Songs,7,4,"Your neck is like a tower of ivory. Your eyes are like the pools in the city of Heshbon, near the gate of that great city. Your nose is as lovely as the tower of Lebanon that stands guard at Damascus."

Song of Songs,7,6,"How pretty you are, how beautiful; how complete the delights of your love."
Song of Songs,7,7,"You are as graceful as a palm tree, and your breasts are clusters of dates."
Song of Songs,7,8,"I will climb the palm tree and pick its fruit. To me your breasts are like bunches of grapes, your breath like the fragrance of apples,"

Song of Songs,8,4,"Promise me, women of Jerusalem, that you will not interrupt our love."
Song of Songs,8,5,"Who is this coming from the desert, arm in arm with her lover? Under the apple tree I woke you, in the place where you were born."
