Nehemiah,1,1,"This is the account of what Nehemiah son of Hacaliah accomplished. In the month of Kislev in the twentieth year that Artaxerxes was emperor of Persia, I, Nehemiah, was in Susa, the capital city."
Nehemiah,1,2,"Hanani, one of my brothers, arrived from Judah with another group, and I asked them about Jerusalem and about our fellow-Jews who had returned from exile in Babylonia."
Nehemiah,1,3,They told me that those who had survived and were back in the homeland were in great difficulty and that the foreigners who lived near by looked down on them. They also told me that the walls of Jerusalem were still broken down and that the gates had not been restored since the time they were burnt.
Nehemiah,1,4,"When I heard all this, I sat down and wept. For several days I mourned and did not eat. I prayed to God,"
Nehemiah,1,5,"“ LORD God of Heaven! You are great, and we stand in fear of you. You faithfully keep your covenant with those who love you and do what you command."
Nehemiah,1,6,"Look at me, LORD , and hear my prayer, as I pray day and night for your servants, the people of Israel. I confess that we, the people of Israel, have sinned. My ancestors and I have sinned."
Nehemiah,1,7,"We have acted wickedly against you and have not done what you commanded. We have not kept the laws which you gave us through Moses, your servant."
Nehemiah,1,8,"Remember now what you told Moses: ‘If you people of Israel are unfaithful to me, I will scatter you among the other nations."
Nehemiah,1,9,"But then if you turn back to me and do what I have commanded you, I will bring you back to the place where I have chosen to be worshipped, even though you are scattered to the ends of the earth.’"
Nehemiah,1,10,"“Lord, these are your servants, your own people. You rescued them by your great power and strength."
Nehemiah,1,11,Listen now to my prayer and to the prayers of all your other servants who want to honour you. Give me success today and make the emperor merciful to me.” In those days I was the emperor's wine steward.
Nehemiah,2,1,"One day four months later, when Emperor Artaxerxes was dining, I took the wine to him. He had never seen me look sad before,"
Nehemiah,2,2,"so he asked, “Why are you looking so sad? You aren't ill, so it must be that you're unhappy.” I was startled"
Nehemiah,2,3,"and answered, “May Your Majesty live for ever! How can I help looking sad when the city where my ancestors are buried is in ruins and its gates have been destroyed by fire?”"
Nehemiah,2,4,"The emperor asked, “What is it that you want?” I prayed to the God of Heaven,"
Nehemiah,2,5,"and then I said to the emperor, “If Your Majesty is pleased with me and is willing to grant my request, let me go to the land of Judah, to the city where my ancestors are buried, so that I can rebuild the city.”"
Nehemiah,2,6,"The emperor, with the empress sitting at his side, approved my request. He asked me how long I would be gone and when I would return, and I told him."
Nehemiah,2,7,"Then I asked him to grant me the favour of giving me letters to the governors of West Euphrates Province, instructing them to let me travel to Judah."
Nehemiah,2,8,"I asked also for a letter to Asaph, keeper of the royal forests, instructing him to supply me with timber for the gates of the fort that guards the Temple, for the city walls, and for the house I was to live in. The emperor gave me all I asked for, because God was with me."
Nehemiah,2,9,"The emperor sent some army officers and a troop of horsemen with me, and I made the journey to West Euphrates. There I gave the emperor's letters to the governors."
Nehemiah,2,10,"But Sanballat, from the town of Beth Horon, and Tobiah, an official in the province of Ammon, heard that someone had come to work for the good of the people of Israel, and they were highly indignant."
Nehemiah,2,11,"I went on to Jerusalem, and for three days"
Nehemiah,2,12,"I did not tell anyone what God had inspired me to do for Jerusalem. Then in the middle of the night I got up and went out, taking a few of my companions with me. The only animal we took was the donkey that I rode on."
Nehemiah,2,13,"It was still night as I left the city through the Valley Gate on the west and went south past Dragon's Fountain to the Rubbish Gate. As I went, I inspected the broken walls of the city and the gates that had been destroyed by fire."
Nehemiah,2,14,"Then on the east side of the city I went north to the Fountain Gate and the King's Pool. The donkey I was riding could not find any path through the rubble,"
Nehemiah,2,15,"so I went down into the valley of the Kidron and rode along, looking at the wall. Then I returned the way I had come and went back into the city through the Valley Gate."
Nehemiah,2,16,"None of the local officials knew where I had been or what I had been doing. So far I had not said anything to any of my fellow-Jews — the priests, the leaders, the officials, or anyone else who would be taking part in the work."
Nehemiah,2,17,"But now I said to them, “See what trouble we are in because Jerusalem is in ruins and its gates are destroyed! Let's rebuild the city walls and put an end to our disgrace.”"
Nehemiah,2,18,"And I told them how God had been with me and helped me, and what the emperor had said to me. They responded, “Let's start rebuilding!” And they got ready to start the work."
Nehemiah,2,19,"When Sanballat, Tobiah, and an Arab named Geshem heard what we were planning to do, they laughed at us and said, “What do you think you're doing? Are you going to rebel against the emperor?”"
Nehemiah,2,20,"I answered, “The God of Heaven will give us success. We are his servants, and we are going to start building. But you have no right to any property in Jerusalem, and you have no share in its traditions.”"
Nehemiah,3,1,"This is how the city wall was rebuilt. The High Priest Eliashib and his fellow-priests rebuilt the Sheep Gate, dedicated it, and put the gates in place. They dedicated the wall as far as the Tower of the Hundred and the Tower of Hananel."
Nehemiah,3,2,The men of Jericho built the next section. Zaccur son of Imri built the next section.
Nehemiah,3,3,"The clan of Hassenaah built the Fish Gate. They put the beams and the gates in place, and put in the bolts and bars for locking the gate."
Nehemiah,3,4,"Meremoth, the son of Uriah and grandson of Hakkoz, built the next section. Meshullam, the son of Berechiah and grandson of Meshezabel, built the next section. Zadok son of Baana built the next section."
Nehemiah,3,5,"The men of Tekoa built the next section, but the leading men of the town refused to do the manual labour assigned to them by the supervisors."
Nehemiah,3,6,"Joiada son of Paseah and Meshullam son of Besodeiah rebuilt Jeshanah Gate. They put the beams and the gates in place, and put in the bolts and bars for locking the gate."
Nehemiah,3,7,"Melatiah from Gibeon, Jadon from Meronoth, and the men of Gibeon and Mizpah built the next section, as far as the residence of the governor of West Euphrates."
Nehemiah,3,8,"Uzziel son of Harhaiah, a goldsmith, built the next section. Hananiah, a maker of perfumes, built the next section, as far as Broad Wall."
Nehemiah,3,9,"Rephaiah son of Hur, ruler of half the Jerusalem District, built the next section."
Nehemiah,3,10,"Jedaiah son of Harumaph built the next section, which was near his own house. Hattush son of Hashabneiah built the next section."
Nehemiah,3,11,Malchijah son of Harim and Hasshub son of Pahath Moab built both the next section and the Tower of the Ovens.
Nehemiah,3,12,"Shallum son of Hallohesh, ruler of the other half of the Jerusalem District, built the next section. (His daughters helped with the work.)"
Nehemiah,3,13,"Hanun and the inhabitants of the city of Zanoah rebuilt the Valley Gate. They put the gates in place, put in the bolts and the bars for locking the gate, and repaired the wall for 440 metres, as far as the Rubbish Gate."
Nehemiah,3,14,"Malchijah son of Rechab, ruler of the Beth Haccherem District, rebuilt the Rubbish Gate. He put the gates in place, and put in the bolts and the bars for locking the gate."
Nehemiah,3,15,"Shallum son of Colhozeh, ruler of the Mizpah District, rebuilt the Fountain Gate. He covered the gateway, put the gates in place, and put in the bolts and the bars. At the Pool of Shelah he built the wall next to the royal garden, as far as the steps leading down from David's City."
Nehemiah,3,16,"Nehemiah son of Azbuk, ruler of half the Bethzur District, built the next section, as far as David's tomb, the pool, and the barracks."
Nehemiah,3,17,"The following Levites rebuilt the next several sections of the wall: Rehum son of Bani built the next section; Hashabiah, ruler of half the Keilah District, built the next section on behalf of his district;"
Nehemiah,3,18,"Bavvai son of Henadad, ruler of the other half of the Keilah District, built the next section;"
Nehemiah,3,19,"Ezer son of Jeshua, ruler of Mizpah, built the next section in front of the armoury, as far as the place where the wall turns;"
Nehemiah,3,20,"Baruch son of Zabbai built the next section, as far as the entrance to the house of the High Priest Eliashib;"
Nehemiah,3,21,"Meremoth, the son of Uriah and grandson of Hakkoz, built the next section, up to the far end of Eliashib's house."
Nehemiah,3,22,The following priests rebuilt the next several sections of the wall: Priests from the area around Jerusalem built the next section;
Nehemiah,3,23,"Benjamin and Hasshub built the next section, which was in front of their houses; Azariah, the son of Maaseiah and grandson of Ananiah, built the next section, which was in front of his house;"
Nehemiah,3,24,"Binnui son of Henadad built the next section, from Azariah's house to the corner of the wall;"
Nehemiah,4,1,"When Sanballat heard that we Jews had begun rebuilding the wall, he was furious and began to ridicule us."
Nehemiah,4,2,"In front of his companions and the Samaritan troops he said, “What do these miserable Jews think they're doing? Do they intend to rebuild the city? Do they think that by offering sacrifices they can finish the work in one day? Can they make building stones out of heaps of burnt rubble?”"
Nehemiah,4,3,"Tobiah was standing there beside him, and he added, “What kind of wall could they ever build? Even a fox could knock it down!”"
Nehemiah,4,4,"I prayed, “Listen to them mocking us, O God! Let their ridicule fall on their own heads. Let them be robbed of everything they have, and let them be taken as prisoners to a foreign land."
Nehemiah,4,5,"Don't forgive the evil they do and don't forget their sins, for they have insulted us who are building.”"
Nehemiah,4,6,"So we went on rebuilding the wall, and soon it was half its full height, because the people were eager to work."
Nehemiah,4,7,"Sanballat, Tobiah, and the people of Arabia, Ammon, and Ashdod heard that we were making progress in rebuilding the wall of Jerusalem and that the gaps in the wall were being closed, and they were very angry."
Nehemiah,4,8,"So they all plotted together to come and attack Jerusalem and create confusion,"
Nehemiah,4,9,but we prayed to our God and kept men on guard against them day and night.
Nehemiah,4,10,The people of Judah had a song they sang: “We grow weak carrying burdens; There's so much rubble to take away. How can we build the wall today?”
Nehemiah,4,11,"Our enemies thought we would not see them or know what was happening until they were already upon us, killing us and putting an end to our work."
Nehemiah,4,12,But time after time Jews who were living among our enemies came to warn us of the plans our enemies were making against us.
Nehemiah,4,13,"So I armed the people with swords, spears, and bows, and stationed them by clans behind the wall, wherever it was still unfinished."
Nehemiah,4,14,"I saw that the people were worried, so I said to them and to their leaders and officials, “Don't be afraid of our enemies. Remember how great and terrifying the Lord is, and fight for your fellow-countrymen, your children, your wives, and your homes.”"
Nehemiah,4,15,"Our enemies heard that we had found out what they were plotting, and they realized that God had defeated their plans. Then all of us went back to rebuilding the wall."
Nehemiah,4,16,"From then on half my men worked and half stood guard, wearing coats of armour and armed with spears, shields, and bows. And our leaders gave their full support to the people"
Nehemiah,4,17,"who were rebuilding the wall. Even those who carried building materials worked with one hand and kept a weapon in the other,"
Nehemiah,4,18,and everyone who was building kept a sword strapped to his waist. The man who was to sound the alarm on the bugle stayed with me.
Nehemiah,4,19,"I told the people and their officials and leaders, “The work is spread out over such a distance that we are widely separated from one another on the wall."
Nehemiah,4,20,"If you hear the bugle, gather round me. Our God will fight for us.”"
Nehemiah,4,21,"So every day, from dawn until the stars came out at night, half of us worked on the wall, while the other half stood guard with spears."
Nehemiah,4,22,"During this time I told the men in charge that they and all their helpers had to stay in Jerusalem at night, so that we could guard the city at night as well as work in the daytime."
Nehemiah,4,23,"I didn't take off my clothes even at night, neither did any of my companions nor my servants nor my bodyguard. And we all kept our weapons to hand."
Nehemiah,5,1,"Some time later many of the people, both men and women, began to complain against their fellow-Jews."
Nehemiah,5,2,"Some said, “We have large families, we need corn to keep us alive.”"
Nehemiah,5,3,"Others said, “We have had to mortgage our fields and vineyards and houses to get enough corn to keep us from starving.”"
Nehemiah,5,4,"Still others said, “We had to borrow money to pay the royal tax on our fields and vineyards."
Nehemiah,5,5,We are of the same race as our fellow-Jews. Aren't our children just as good as theirs? But we have to make slaves of our children. Some of our daughters have already been sold as slaves. We are helpless because our fields and vineyards have been taken away from us.”
Nehemiah,5,6,"When I heard their complaints, I was angry"
Nehemiah,5,7,"and decided to act. I denounced the leaders and officials of the people and told them, “You are oppressing your fellow-Jews!” I called a public assembly to deal with the problem"
Nehemiah,5,8,"and said, “As far as we have been able, we have been buying back our Jewish relatives who had to sell themselves to foreigners. Now you are forcing your own relatives to sell themselves to you, their own people!” The leaders were silent and could find nothing to say."
Nehemiah,5,9,"Then I said, “What you are doing is wrong! You ought to obey God and do what's right. Then you would not give our enemies, the Gentiles, any reason to ridicule us."
Nehemiah,5,10,"I have let the people borrow money and corn from me, and so have my companions and the people who work for me. Now let's give up all our claims to repayment."
Nehemiah,5,11,"Cancel all the debts they owe you — money or corn or wine or olive oil. And give them back their fields, vineyards, olive groves, and houses at once!”"
Nehemiah,5,12,"The leaders replied, “We'll do as you say. We'll give the property back and not try to collect the debts.” I called in the priests and made the leaders swear in front of them to keep the promise they had just made."
Nehemiah,5,13,"Then I took off the sash I was wearing round my waist and shook it out. “This is how God will shake any of you who don't keep your promise,” I said. “God will take away your houses and everything you own, and will leave you with nothing.” Everyone who was present said, “Amen!” and praised the LORD . And the leaders kept their promise."
Nehemiah,5,14,"During all the twelve years that I was governor of the land of Judah, from the twentieth year that Artaxerxes was emperor until his 32nd year, neither my relatives nor I ate the food I was entitled to have as governor."
Nehemiah,5,15,"Every governor who had been in office before me had been a burden to the people and had demanded forty silver coins a day for food and wine. Even their servants had oppressed the people. But I acted differently, because I honoured God."
Nehemiah,5,16,I put all my energy into rebuilding the wall and did not acquire any property. Everyone who worked for me joined in the rebuilding.
Nehemiah,5,17,"I regularly fed at my table 150 of the Jewish people and their leaders, besides all the people who came to me from the surrounding nations."
Nehemiah,5,18,"Every day I served one ox, six of the best sheep, and many chickens, and every ten days I provided a fresh supply of wine. But I knew what heavy burdens the people had to bear, so I did not claim the allowance that the governor is entitled to."
Nehemiah,5,19,"I pray you, O God, remember to my credit everything that I have done for this people."
Nehemiah,6,1,"Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem, and the rest of our enemies heard that we had finished building the wall and that there were no gaps left in it, although we still had not set up the gates in the gateways."
Nehemiah,6,2,"So Sanballat and Geshem sent me a message, suggesting that I meet with them in one of the villages in the Plain of Ono. This was a trick of theirs to try to harm me."
Nehemiah,6,3,"I sent messengers to say to them, “I am doing important work and can't go down there. I am not going to let the work stop just to go and see you.”"
Nehemiah,6,4,"They sent me the same message four times, and each time I sent them the same reply."
Nehemiah,6,5,"Then Sanballat sent one of his servants to me with a fifth message, this one in the form of an unsealed letter."
Nehemiah,6,6,It read: “Geshem tells me that a rumour is going round among the neighbouring peoples that you and the Jewish people intend to revolt and that this is why you are rebuilding the wall. He also says you plan to make yourself king
Nehemiah,6,7,"and that you have arranged for some prophets to proclaim in Jerusalem that you are the king of Judah. His Majesty is certain to hear about this, so I suggest that you and I meet to talk the situation over.”"
Nehemiah,6,8,I sent a reply to him: “Nothing of what you are saying is true. You have made it all up yourself.”
Nehemiah,6,9,"They were trying to frighten us into stopping work. I prayed, “But now, God, make me strong!”"
Nehemiah,6,10,"About this time I went to visit Shemaiah, the son of Delaiah and grandson of Mehetabel, who was unable to leave his house. He said to me, “You and I must go and hide together in the Holy Place of the Temple and lock the doors, because they are coming to kill you. Any night now they will come to kill you.”"
Nehemiah,6,11,"I answered, “I'm not the kind of person that runs and hides. Do you think I would try to save my life by hiding in the Temple? I won't do it.”"
Nehemiah,6,12,"When I thought it over, I realized that God had not spoken to Shemaiah, but that Tobiah and Sanballat had bribed him to give me this warning."
Nehemiah,6,13,"They hired him to frighten me into sinning, so that they could ruin my reputation and humiliate me."
Nehemiah,6,14,"I prayed, “God, remember what Tobiah and Sanballat have done and punish them. Remember that woman Noadiah and all the other prophets who tried to frighten me.”"
Nehemiah,6,15,After 52 days of work the entire wall was finished on the 25th day of the month of Elul.
Nehemiah,6,16,"When our enemies in the surrounding nations heard this, they realized that they had lost face, since everyone knew that the work had been done with God's help."
Nehemiah,6,17,During all this time the Jewish leaders had been in correspondence with Tobiah.
Nehemiah,6,18,"Many people in Judah were on his side because of his Jewish father-in-law, Shecaniah son of Arah. In addition, his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berechiah."
Nehemiah,6,19,People would talk in front of me about all the good deeds Tobiah had done and would tell him everything I said. And he kept sending me letters to try to frighten me.
Nehemiah,7,1,"And now the wall had been rebuilt, the gates had all been put in place, and the temple guards, the members of the sacred choir, and the other Levites had been assigned their work."
Nehemiah,7,2,"I put two men in charge of governing the city of Jerusalem: my brother Hanani and Hananiah, commanding officer of the fortress. Hananiah was a reliable and God-fearing man without an equal."
Nehemiah,7,3,I told them not to have the gates of Jerusalem opened in the morning until well after sunrise and to have them closed and barred before the guards went off duty at sunset. I also told them to appoint guards from among the people who lived in Jerusalem and to assign some of them to specific posts and others to patrol the area round their own houses.
Nehemiah,7,4,"Jerusalem was a large city, but not many people were living in it, and not many houses had been built yet."
Nehemiah,7,5,"God inspired me to assemble the people and their leaders and officials and to check their family records. I located the records of those who had first returned from captivity, and this is the information I found:"
Nehemiah,7,6,"Many of the exiles left the province of Babylon and returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his own city. Their families had been living in exile in Babylonia ever since King Nebuchadnezzar had taken them there as prisoners."
Nehemiah,7,7,"Their leaders were Zerubbabel, Joshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, and Baanah."
Nehemiah,8,1,"By the seventh month the people of Israel were all settled in their towns. On the first day of that month they all assembled in Jerusalem, in the square just inside the Water Gate. They asked Ezra, the priest and scholar of the Law which the LORD had given Israel through Moses, to get the book of the Law."
Nehemiah,8,2,"So Ezra brought it to the place where the people had gathered — men, women, and the children who were old enough to understand."
Nehemiah,8,3,"There in the square by the gate he read the Law to them from dawn until noon, and they all listened attentively."
Nehemiah,8,4,"Ezra was standing on a wooden platform that had been built for the occasion. The following men stood at his right: Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah; and the following stood at his left: Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam."
Nehemiah,8,5,"As Ezra stood there on the platform high above the people, they all kept their eyes fixed on him. As soon as he opened the book, they all stood up."
Nehemiah,8,6,"Ezra said, “Praise the LORD , the great God!” All the people raised their arms in the air and answered, “Amen! Amen!” They knelt in worship, with their faces to the ground."
Nehemiah,8,7,"Then they rose and stood in their places, and the following Levites explained the Law to them: Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, and Pelaiah."
Nehemiah,8,8,They gave an oral translation of God's Law and explained it so that the people could understand it.
Nehemiah,8,9,"When the people heard what the Law required, they were so moved that they began to cry. So Nehemiah, who was the governor, Ezra, the priest and scholar of the Law, and the Levites who were explaining the Law told all the people, “This day is holy to the LORD your God, so you are not to mourn or cry."
Nehemiah,8,10,"Now go home and have a feast. Share your food and wine with those who haven't enough. Today is holy to our Lord, so don't be sad. The joy that the LORD gives you will make you strong.”"
Nehemiah,8,11,The Levites went about calming the people and telling them not to be sad on such a holy day.
Nehemiah,8,12,"So all the people went home and ate and drank joyfully and shared what they had with others, because they understood what had been read to them."
Nehemiah,8,13,"The next day the heads of the clans, together with the priests and the Levites, went to Ezra to study the teachings of the Law."
Nehemiah,8,14,"They discovered that the Law, which the LORD gave through Moses, ordered the people of Israel to live in temporary shelters during the Festival of Shelters."
Nehemiah,8,15,"So they gave the following instructions and sent them all through Jerusalem and the other cities and towns: “Go out to the hills and get branches from pines, olives, myrtles, palms, and other trees to make shelters according to the instructions written in the Law.”"
Nehemiah,8,16,"So the people got branches and built shelters on the flat roofs of their houses, in their yards, in the temple courtyard, and in the public squares by the Water Gate and by the Ephraim Gate."
Nehemiah,8,17,"All the people who had come back from captivity built shelters and lived in them. This was the first time it had been done since the days of Joshua son of Nun, and everybody was excited and happy."
Nehemiah,8,18,"From the first day of the festival to the last they read a part of God's Law every day. They celebrated for seven days, and on the eighth day there was a closing ceremony, as required in the Law."
Nehemiah,10,1,"The first to sign was the governor, Nehemiah son of Hacaliah, and then Zedekiah signed. The following also signed:"
Nehemiah,11,1,"The leaders settled in Jerusalem, and the rest of the people drew lots to choose one family out of every ten to go and live in the holy city of Jerusalem, while the rest were to live in the other cities and towns."
Nehemiah,11,2,The people praised anyone else who volunteered to live in Jerusalem.
Nehemiah,11,3,"In the other towns and cities the people of Israel, the priests, the Levites, the temple workmen, and the descendants of Solomon's servants lived on their own property in their own towns. The following is the list of the leading citizens of the province of Judah who lived in Jerusalem:"

Nehemiah,12,1,The following is a list of the priests and Levites who returned from exile with Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and with the High Priest Joshua:
Nehemiah,13,1," When the Law of Moses was being read aloud to the people, they came to the passage that said that no Ammonite or Moabite was ever to be permitted to join God's people."
Nehemiah,13,2,"This was because the people of Ammon and Moab did not give food and water to the Israelites on their way out of Egypt. Instead, they paid money to Balaam to curse Israel, but our God turned the curse into a blessing."
Nehemiah,13,3,"When the people of Israel heard this law read, they excluded all foreigners from the community."
Nehemiah,13,4,"The priest Eliashib, who was in charge of the temple storerooms, had for a long time been on good terms with Tobiah."
Nehemiah,13,5,"He allowed Tobiah to use a large room that was intended only for storing offerings of corn and incense, the equipment used in the Temple, the offerings for the priests, and the tithes of corn, wine, and olive oil given to the Levites, to the temple musicians, and to the temple guards."
Nehemiah,13,6,"While this was going on, I was not in Jerusalem, because in the 32nd year that Artaxerxes was king of Babylon I had gone back to report to him. After some time I received his permission"
Nehemiah,13,7,and returned to Jerusalem. There I was shocked to find that Eliashib had allowed Tobiah to use a room in the Temple.
Nehemiah,13,8,I was furious and threw out all Tobiah's belongings.
Nehemiah,13,9,"I gave orders for the rooms to be ritually purified and for the temple equipment, grain offerings, and incense to be put back."
Nehemiah,13,10," I also learnt that the temple musicians and other Levites had left Jerusalem and gone back to their farms, because the people had not been giving them enough to live on."
Nehemiah,13,11,I reprimanded the officials for letting the Temple be neglected. And I brought the Levites and musicians back to the Temple and put them to work again.
Nehemiah,13,12,"Then all the people of Israel again started bringing to the temple storerooms their tithes of corn, wine, and olive oil."
Nehemiah,13,13,"I put the following men in charge of the storerooms: Shelemiah, a priest; Zadok, a scholar of the Law; and Pedaiah, a Levite. Hanan, the son of Zaccur and grandson of Mattaniah, was to be their assistant. I knew I could trust these men to be honest in distributing the supplies to their fellow-workers."
Nehemiah,13,14,"Remember, my God, all these things that I have done for your Temple and its worship."
Nehemiah,13,15," At that time I saw people in Judah pressing juice from grapes on the Sabbath. Others were loading corn, wine, grapes, figs, and other things on their donkeys and taking them into Jerusalem; I warned them not to sell anything on the Sabbath."
Nehemiah,13,16,"Some people from the city of Tyre were living in Jerusalem, and they brought fish and all kinds of goods into the city to sell to our people on the Sabbath."
Nehemiah,13,17,"I reprimanded the Jewish leaders and said, “Look at the evil you're doing! You're making the Sabbath unholy."
Nehemiah,13,18,This is exactly why God punished your ancestors when he brought destruction on this city. And yet you insist on bringing more of God's anger down on Israel by profaning the Sabbath.”
Nehemiah,13,19,"So I gave orders for the city gates to be shut at the beginning of every Sabbath, as soon as evening began to fall, and not to be opened again until the Sabbath was over. I stationed some of my men at the gates to make sure that nothing was brought into the city on the Sabbath."
Nehemiah,13,20,Once or twice merchants who sold all kinds of goods spent Friday night outside the city walls.
Nehemiah,13,21,"I warned them, “It's no use waiting out there for morning to come. If you try this again, I'll use force against you.” From then on they did not come back on the Sabbath."
Nehemiah,13,22,"I ordered the Levites to purify themselves and to go and guard the gates to make sure that the Sabbath was kept holy. Remember me, O God, for this also, and spare me because of your great love."
Nehemiah,13,23," At that time I also discovered that many of the Jewish men had married women from Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab."
Nehemiah,13,24,Half their children spoke the language of Ashdod or some other language and didn't know how to speak our language.
Nehemiah,13,25,"I reprimanded the men, called down curses on them, beat them, and pulled out their hair. Then I made them take an oath in God's name that never again would they or their children intermarry with foreigners."
Nehemiah,13,26,"I said, “It was foreign women that made King Solomon sin. He was a man who was greater than any of the kings of other nations. God loved him and made him king over all Israel, and yet he fell into this sin."
Nehemiah,13,27,Are we then to follow your example and disobey our God by marrying foreign women?”
Nehemiah,13,28," Joiada was the son of Eliashib the High Priest, but one of Joiada's sons married the daughter of Sanballat, from the town of Beth Horon, so I made Joiada leave Jerusalem."
Nehemiah,13,29,"Remember, O God, how those people defiled both the office of priest and the covenant you made with the priests and the Levites."
Nehemiah,13,30,I purified the people from everything foreign; I prepared regulations for the priests and the Levites so that each one would know his duty;
Nehemiah,13,31,"I arranged for the wood used for burning the offerings to be brought at the proper times, and for the people to bring their offerings of the first corn and the first fruits that ripened. Remember all this, O God, and give me credit for it."
