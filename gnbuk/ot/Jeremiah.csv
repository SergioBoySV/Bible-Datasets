Jeremiah,1,1,"This book is the account of what was said by Jeremiah son of Hilkiah, one of the priests of the town of Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin."
Jeremiah,1,2,"The LORD spoke to Jeremiah in the thirteenth year that Josiah son of Amon was king of Judah,"
Jeremiah,1,3,"and he spoke to him again when Josiah's son Jehoiakim was king. After that, the LORD spoke to him many times, until the eleventh year of the reign of Zedekiah son of Josiah. In the fifth month of that year the people of Jerusalem were taken into exile."
Jeremiah,1,4,"The LORD said to me,"
Jeremiah,1,5,"“I chose you before I gave you life, and before you were born I selected you to be a prophet to the nations.”"
Jeremiah,1,6,"I answered, “Sovereign LORD , I don't know how to speak; I am too young.”"
Jeremiah,1,7,"But the LORD said to me, “Do not say that you are too young, but go to the people I send you to, and tell them everything I command you to say."
Jeremiah,1,8,"Do not be afraid of them, for I will be with you to protect you. I, the LORD , have spoken!”"
Jeremiah,1,9,"Then the LORD stretched out his hand, touched my lips, and said to me, “Listen, I am giving you the words you must speak."
Jeremiah,1,10,"Today I give you authority over nations and kingdoms to uproot and to pull down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant.”"
Jeremiah,1,11,"The LORD asked me, “Jeremiah, what do you see?” I answered, “A branch of an almond tree.”"
Jeremiah,1,12,"“You are right,” the LORD said, “and I am watching to see that my words come true.”"
Jeremiah,1,13,"Then the LORD spoke to me again. “What else do you see?” he asked. I answered, “I see a pot boiling in the north, and it is about to tip over this way.”"
Jeremiah,1,14,"He said to me, “Destruction will boil over from the north on all who live in this land,"
Jeremiah,1,15,"because I am calling all the nations in the north to come. Their kings will set up their thrones at the gates of Jerusalem and round its walls, and also round the other cities of Judah."
Jeremiah,1,16,"I will punish my people because they have sinned; they have abandoned me, have offered sacrifices to other gods, and have made idols and worshipped them."
Jeremiah,1,17,"Get ready, Jeremiah; go and tell them everything I command you to say. Do not be afraid of them now, or I will make you even more afraid when you are with them."
Jeremiah,2,1,The LORD told me
Jeremiah,2,2,"to proclaim this message to everyone in Jerusalem. “I remember how faithful you were when you were young, how you loved me when we were first married; you followed me through the desert, through a land that had not been sown."
Jeremiah,2,3,"Israel, you belonged to me alone; you were my sacred possession. I sent suffering and disaster on everyone who hurt you. I, the LORD , have spoken.”"
Jeremiah,2,4,"Listen to the LORD 's message, you descendants of Jacob, you tribes of Israel."
Jeremiah,2,5,The LORD says: “What accusation did your ancestors bring against me? What made them turn away from me? They worshipped worthless idols and became worthless themselves.
Jeremiah,2,6,"They did not care about me, even though I rescued them from Egypt and led them through the wilderness: a land of deserts and sand dunes, a dry and dangerous land where no one lives and no one will even travel."
Jeremiah,2,7,"I brought them into a fertile land, to enjoy its harvests and its other good things. But instead they ruined my land; they defiled the country I had given them."
Jeremiah,2,8,"The priests did not ask, ‘Where is the LORD ?’ My own priests did not know me. The rulers rebelled against me; the prophets spoke in the name of Baal and worshipped useless idols."
Jeremiah,2,9,"“And so I, the LORD , will state my case against my people again. I will bring charges against their descendants."
Jeremiah,2,10,"Go west to the island of Cyprus, and send someone eastwards to the land of Kedar. You will see that nothing like this has ever happened before."
Jeremiah,2,11,"No other nation has ever changed its gods, even though they were not real. But my people have exchanged me, the God who has brought them honour, for gods that can do nothing for them."
Jeremiah,2,12,"And so I command the sky to shake with horror, to be amazed and astonished,"
Jeremiah,2,13,"for my people have committed two sins: they have turned away from me, the spring of fresh water, and they have dug cisterns, cracked cisterns that can hold no water at all."
Jeremiah,2,14,“Israel is not a slave; he was not born into slavery. Why then do his enemies hunt him down?
Jeremiah,2,15,"They have roared at him like lions; they have made his land a desert, and his towns lie in ruins, completely abandoned."
Jeremiah,2,16,"Yes, those of Memphis and Tahpanhes have cracked his skull."
Jeremiah,2,17,"Israel, you brought this on yourself! You deserted me, the LORD your God, while I was leading you along the way."
Jeremiah,2,18,What do you think you will gain by going to Egypt to drink water from the Nile? What do you think you will gain by going to Assyria to drink water from the Euphrates?
Jeremiah,2,19,"Your own evil will punish you, and your turning from me will condemn you. You will learn how bitter and wrong it is to abandon me, the LORD your God, and no longer to remain faithful to me. I, the Sovereign LORD Almighty, have spoken.”"
Jeremiah,2,20,"The Sovereign LORD says, “Israel, long ago you rejected my authority; you refused to obey me and worship me. On every high hill and under every green tree you worshipped fertility gods."
Jeremiah,2,21,"I planted you like a choice vine from the very best seed. But look what you have become! You are like a rotten, worthless vine."
Jeremiah,2,22,"Even if you washed with the strongest soap, I would still see the stain of your guilt."
Jeremiah,2,23,"How can you say you have not defiled yourself, that you have never worshipped Baal? Look how you sinned in the valley; see what you have done. You are like a wild camel on heat, running about loose,"
Jeremiah,2,24,"rushing into the desert. When she is on heat, who can control her? No male that wants her has to trouble himself; she is always available at mating time."
Jeremiah,2,25,"Israel, don't wear your feet out, or let your throat become dry from chasing after other gods. But you say, ‘No! I can't turn back. I have loved foreign gods and will go after them.’ ”"
Jeremiah,2,26,"The LORD says, “Just as a thief is disgraced when caught, so all you people of Israel will be disgraced — your kings and officials, your priests and prophets."
Jeremiah,2,27,"You will all be disgraced — you that say that a tree is your father and that a rock is your mother. This will happen because you turned away from me instead of turning to me. But when you are in trouble, you ask me to come and save you."
Jeremiah,2,28,"“Where are the gods that you made for yourselves? When you are in trouble, let them save you — if they can! Judah, you have as many gods as you have cities."
Jeremiah,2,29,What is your complaint? Why have you rebelled against me?
Jeremiah,2,30,"I punished you, but it did no good; you would not let me correct you. Like a raging lion, you have murdered your prophets."
Jeremiah,2,31,"People of Israel, listen to what I am saying. Have I been like a desert to you, like a dark and dangerous land? Why, then, do you say that you will do as you please, that you will never come back to me?"
Jeremiah,2,32,"Does a young woman forget her jewellery, or a bride her wedding dress? But my people have forgotten me for more days than can be counted."
Jeremiah,2,33,You certainly know how to chase after lovers. Even the worst of women can learn from you.
Jeremiah,2,34,"Your clothes are stained with the blood of the poor and innocent, not with the blood of burglars. “But in spite of all this,"
Jeremiah,2,35,"you say, ‘I am innocent; surely the LORD is no longer angry with me.’ But I, the LORD , will punish you because you deny that you have sinned."
Jeremiah,2,36,"You have cheapened yourself by turning to the gods of other nations. You will be disappointed by Egypt, just as you were by Assyria."
Jeremiah,2,37,"You will turn away from Egypt, hanging your head in shame. I, the LORD , have rejected those you trust; you will not gain anything from them.”"
Jeremiah,3,1,"The LORD says, “If a man divorces his wife, and she leaves him and becomes another man's wife, he cannot take her back again. This would completely defile the land. But, Israel, you have had many lovers, and now you want to return to me!"
Jeremiah,3,2,"Look up at the hilltops. Is there any place where you have not acted like a prostitute? You waited for lovers along the roadside, as an Arab waits for victims in the desert. You have defiled the land with your prostitution."
Jeremiah,3,3,"That is why the rains were held back, and the spring showers did not come. You even look like a prostitute; you have no shame."
Jeremiah,3,4,"“And now you say to me, ‘You are my father, and you have loved me ever since I was a child."
Jeremiah,3,5,"You won't always be angry; you won't be cross with me for ever.’ Israel, that is what you said, but you did all the evil you could.”"
Jeremiah,3,6," When Josiah was king, the LORD said to me, “Have you seen what Israel, that unfaithful woman, has done? She has turned away from me, and on every high hill and under every green tree she has acted like a prostitute."
Jeremiah,3,7,"I thought that after she had done all this, she would surely return to me. But she did not return, and her unfaithful sister Judah saw it all."
Jeremiah,3,8,"Judah also saw that I divorced Israel and sent her away because she had turned from me and had become a prostitute. But Judah, Israel's unfaithful sister, was not afraid. She too became a prostitute"
Jeremiah,3,9,"and was not at all ashamed. She defiled the land, and she committed adultery by worshipping stones and trees."
Jeremiah,3,10,"And after all this, Judah, Israel's unfaithful sister, only pretended to return to me; she was not sincere. I, the LORD , have spoken.”"
Jeremiah,3,11,"Then the LORD told me that, even though Israel had turned away from him, she had proved to be better than unfaithful Judah."
Jeremiah,3,12,"He told me to go and say to Israel, “Unfaithful Israel, come back to me. I am merciful and will not be angry; I will not be angry with you for ever."
Jeremiah,3,13,"Only admit that you are guilty and that you have rebelled against the LORD , your God. Confess that under every green tree you have given your love to foreign gods and that you have not obeyed my commands. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Jeremiah,3,14,"“Unfaithful people, come back; you belong to me. I will take one of you from each town and two from each clan, and I will bring you back to Mount Zion."
Jeremiah,3,15,"I will give you rulers who obey me, and they will rule you with wisdom and understanding."
Jeremiah,3,16,"Then when you have become numerous in that land, people will no longer talk about my Covenant Box. They will no longer think about it or remember it; they will not even need it, nor will they make another one."
Jeremiah,3,17,"When that time comes, Jerusalem will be called ‘The Throne of the LORD ’, and all nations will gather there to worship me. They will no longer do what their stubborn and evil hearts tell them."
Jeremiah,3,18,"Israel will join with Judah, and together they will come from exile in the country in the north and will return to the land that I gave your ancestors as a permanent possession.”"
Jeremiah,3,19,"The LORD says, “Israel, I wanted to accept you as my child and give you a delightful land, the most beautiful land in all the world. I wanted you to call me father, and never again turn away from me."
Jeremiah,3,20,"But like an unfaithful wife, you have not been faithful to me. I, the LORD , have spoken.”"
Jeremiah,3,21,"A noise is heard on the hilltops: it is the people of Israel crying and pleading, because they have lived sinful lives and have forgotten the LORD their God."
Jeremiah,3,22,"Return, all of you who have turned away from the LORD; he will heal you and make you faithful. You say, “Yes, we are coming to the LORD , because he is our God."
Jeremiah,3,23,We were not helped at all by our pagan worship on the hilltops. Help for Israel comes only from the LORD our God.
Jeremiah,3,24,"But the worship of Baal, the god of shame, has made us lose flocks and herds, sons and daughters — everything that our ancestors have worked for since ancient times."
Jeremiah,3,25,We should lie down in shame and let our disgrace cover us. We and our ancestors have always sinned against the LORD our God; we have never obeyed his commands.”
Jeremiah,4,1,"The LORD says, “People of Israel, if you want to turn, then turn back to me. If you are faithful to me and remove the idols I hate,"
Jeremiah,4,2,"it will be right for you to swear by my name. Then all the nations will ask me to bless them, and they will praise me.”"
Jeremiah,4,3," The LORD says to the people of Judah and Jerusalem, “Plough up your unploughed fields; do not sow your seeds among thorns."
Jeremiah,4,4,"Keep your covenant with me, your LORD , and dedicate yourselves to me, you people of Judah and Jerusalem. If you don't, my anger will burn like fire because of the evil things you have done. It will burn, and there will be no one to put it out.”"
Jeremiah,4,5,Blow the trumpet throughout the land! Shout loud and clear! Tell the people of Judah and Jerusalem to run to the fortified cities.
Jeremiah,4,6,Point the way to Zion! Run for safety! Don't delay! The LORD is bringing disaster and great destruction from the north.
Jeremiah,4,7,"Like a lion coming from its hiding place, a destroyer of nations has set out. He is coming to destroy Judah. The cities of Judah will be left in ruins, and no one will live in them."
Jeremiah,4,8,"So put on sackcloth, and weep and wail because the fierce anger of the LORD has not turned away from Judah."
Jeremiah,4,9,"The LORD said, “On that day kings and officials will lose their courage; priests will be shocked and prophets will be astonished.”"
Jeremiah,4,10,"Then I said, “Sovereign LORD , you have completely deceived the people of Jerusalem! You have said there would be peace, but a sword is at their throats.”"
Jeremiah,4,11,The time is coming when the people of Jerusalem will be told that a scorching wind is blowing in from the desert towards them. It will not be a gentle wind that only blows away the chaff —
Jeremiah,4,12,the wind that comes at the LORD 's command will be much stronger than that! It is the LORD himself who is pronouncing judgement on his people.
Jeremiah,4,13,"Look, the enemy is coming like clouds. Their war chariots are like a whirlwind, and their horses are faster than eagles. We are lost! We are doomed!"
Jeremiah,4,14,"Jerusalem, wash the evil from your heart, so that you may be saved. How long will you go on thinking sinful thoughts?"
Jeremiah,4,15,Messengers from the city of Dan and from the hills of Ephraim announce the bad news.
Jeremiah,4,16,They have come to warn the nations and to tell Jerusalem that enemies are coming from a country far away. These enemies will shout against the cities of Judah
Jeremiah,4,17,"and will surround Jerusalem like men guarding a field, because her people have rebelled against the LORD . The LORD has spoken."
Jeremiah,4,18,"Judah, you have brought this on yourself by the way you have lived and by the things you have done. Your sin has caused this suffering; it has stabbed you through the heart."
Jeremiah,4,19,The pain! I can't bear the pain! My heart! My heart is beating wildly! I can't keep quiet; I hear the trumpets and the shouts of battle.
Jeremiah,4,20,One disaster follows another; the whole country is left in ruins. Suddenly our tents are destroyed; their curtains are torn to pieces.
Jeremiah,4,21,How long must I see the battle raging and hear the blasts of trumpets?
Jeremiah,4,22,"The LORD says, “My people are stupid; they don't know me. They are like foolish children; they have no understanding. They are experts at doing what is evil, but failures at doing what is good.”"
Jeremiah,4,23,I looked at the earth — it was a barren waste; at the sky — there was no light.
Jeremiah,4,24,"I looked at the mountains — they were shaking, and the hills were rocking to and fro."
Jeremiah,4,25,I saw that there were no people; even the birds had flown away.
Jeremiah,4,26,The fertile land had become a desert; its cities were in ruins because of the LORD 's fierce anger.
Jeremiah,4,27,"(The LORD has said that the whole earth will become a wilderness, but that he will not completely destroy it.)"
Jeremiah,4,28,The earth will mourn; the sky will grow dark. The LORD has spoken and will not change his mind. He has made his decision and will not turn back.
Jeremiah,4,29,"At the noise of the horsemen and bowmen everyone will run away. Some will run to the forest, others will climb up among the rocks. Every town will be left empty, and no one will live in them again."
Jeremiah,4,30,"Jerusalem, you are doomed! Why do you dress in scarlet? Why do you put on jewellery and paint your eyes? You are making yourself beautiful for nothing! Your lovers have rejected you and want to kill you."
Jeremiah,4,31,"I heard a cry, like a woman in labour, a scream like a woman bearing her first child. It was the cry of Jerusalem gasping for breath, stretching out her hand and saying, “I am doomed! They are coming to kill me!”"
Jeremiah,5,1,"People of Jerusalem, run through your streets! Look around! See for yourselves! Search the market places! Can you find one person who does what is right and tries to be faithful to God? If you can, the LORD will forgive Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,5,2,"Even though you claim to worship the LORD, you do not mean what you say."
Jeremiah,5,3,"Surely the LORD looks for faithfulness. He struck you, but you paid no attention; he crushed you, but you refused to learn. You were stubborn and would not turn from your sins."
Jeremiah,5,4,"Then I thought, “These are only the poor and ignorant. They behave foolishly; they don't know what their God requires, what the LORD wants them to do."
Jeremiah,5,5,"I will go to the people in power, and talk with them. Surely they know what their God requires, what the LORD wants them to do.” But all of them have rejected the LORD 's authority and refuse to obey him."
Jeremiah,5,6,"That is why lions from the forest will kill them; wolves from the desert will tear them to pieces, and leopards will prowl through their towns. If those people go out, they will be torn apart because their sins are numerous and time after time they have turned from God."
Jeremiah,5,7,"The LORD asked, “Why should I forgive the sins of my people? They have abandoned me and have worshipped gods that are not real. I fed my people until they were full, but they committed adultery and spent their time with prostitutes."
Jeremiah,5,8,"They were like well-fed stallions wild with desire, each lusting for his neighbour's wife."
Jeremiah,5,9,Shouldn't I punish them for these things and take revenge on a nation such as this?
Jeremiah,5,10,"I will send enemies to cut down my people's vineyards, but not to destroy them completely. I will tell them to strip away the branches, because those branches are not mine."
Jeremiah,5,11,"The people of Israel and Judah have betrayed me completely. I, the LORD , have spoken.”"
Jeremiah,5,12,"The LORD 's people have denied him and have said, “He won't really do anything. We won't have hard times; we won't have war or famine.”"
Jeremiah,6,1,"People of Benjamin, run for safety! Escape from Jerusalem! Sound the trumpet in Tekoa and build a signal fire in Beth Haccherem. Disaster and destruction are about to come from the north."
Jeremiah,6,2,"The city of Zion is beautiful, but it will be destroyed;"
Jeremiah,6,3,"kings will camp there with their armies. They will pitch their tents round the city, and they will each camp wherever they want."
Jeremiah,6,4,"They will say, “Prepare to attack Jerusalem! Get ready! We'll attack at noon!” But then they will say, “It's too late, the day is almost over, and the evening shadows are growing long."
Jeremiah,6,5,We'll attack by night; we'll destroy the city's fortresses.”
Jeremiah,6,6,"The LORD Almighty has ordered these kings to cut down trees and build mounds in order to besiege Jerusalem. He has said, “I will punish this city because it is full of oppression."
Jeremiah,6,7,"As a well keeps its water fresh, so Jerusalem keeps its evil fresh. I hear violence and destruction in the city; sickness and wounds are all I see."
Jeremiah,6,8,"People of Jerusalem, let these troubles be a warning to you, or else I will abandon you; I will turn your city into a desert, a place where no one lives.”"
Jeremiah,6,9,"The LORD Almighty said to me, “Israel will be stripped clean like a vineyard from which every grape has been picked. So you must rescue everyone you can while there is still time.”"
Jeremiah,6,10,"I answered, “Who would listen to me if I spoke to them and warned them? They are stubborn and refuse to listen to your message; they laugh at what you tell me to say."
Jeremiah,6,11,"Your anger against them burns in me too, LORD , and I can't hold it in any longer.” Then the LORD said to me, “Pour out my anger on the children in the streets and on the gatherings of the young people. Husbands and wives will be taken away, and even the very old will not be spared."
Jeremiah,6,12,"Their houses will be given to others, and so will their fields and their wives. I am going to punish the people of this land."
Jeremiah,6,13,"Everyone, great and small, tries to make money dishonestly; even prophets and priests cheat the people."
Jeremiah,6,14,"They act as if my people's wounds were only scratches. ‘All is well,’ they say, when all is not well."
Jeremiah,6,15,"Were they ashamed because they did these disgusting things? No, they were not at all ashamed; they don't even know how to blush. And so they will fall as others have fallen; when I punish them, that will be the end of them. I, the LORD , have spoken.”"
Jeremiah,6,16,"The LORD said to his people, “Stand at the crossroads and look. Ask for the ancient paths and where the best road is. Walk on it, and you will live in peace.” But they said, “No, we will not!”"
Jeremiah,6,17,"Then the LORD appointed watchmen to listen for the trumpet's warning. But they said, “We will not listen.”"
Jeremiah,6,18,"So the LORD said, “Listen, you nations, and learn what is going to happen to my people."
Jeremiah,6,19,"Listen, earth! As punishment for all their schemes I am bringing ruin on these people, because they have rejected my teaching and have not obeyed my words."
Jeremiah,6,20,"What do I care about the incense they bring me from Sheba, or the spices from a distant land? I will not accept their offerings or be pleased with their sacrifices."
Jeremiah,6,21,"And so I will make these people stumble and fall. Parents and children will die, and so will friends and neighbours.”"
Jeremiah,6,22,"The LORD says, “People are coming from a country in the north; a mighty nation far away is preparing for war."
Jeremiah,6,23,"They have taken up their bows and swords; they are cruel and merciless. They sound like the roaring sea, as they ride their horses. They are ready for battle against Jerusalem.”"
Jeremiah,6,24,"“We have heard the news,” say the people of Jerusalem, “and our hands hang limp; we are seized by anguish and pain like a woman in labour."
Jeremiah,6,25,"We dare not go to the countryside or walk on the roads, because our enemies are armed and terror is all round us.”"
Jeremiah,6,26,"The LORD says to his people, “Put on sackcloth and roll in ashes. Mourn with bitter tears as you would for an only son, because the one who comes to destroy you will suddenly attack."
Jeremiah,6,27,"Jeremiah, test my people, as you would test metal, and find out what they are like."
Jeremiah,6,28,"They are all stubborn rebels, hard as bronze and iron. They are all corrupt, going round and spreading gossip."
Jeremiah,6,29,"The furnace burns fiercely, but the waste metals do not melt and run off. It is useless to go on refining my people, because those who are evil are not taken away."
Jeremiah,6,30,"They will be called worthless dross, because I, the LORD , have rejected them.”"
Jeremiah,8,1,"“At that time the bones of the kings and of the officials of Judah, as well as the bones of the priests, of the prophets, and of the other people who lived in Jerusalem, will be taken out of their graves."
Jeremiah,8,2,"Instead of being gathered and buried, their bones will be like manure lying on the ground. They will be spread out before the sun, the moon, and the stars, which these people have loved and served, and which they have consulted and worshipped."
Jeremiah,8,3,"And the people of this evil nation who survive, who live in the places where I have scattered them, will prefer to die rather than to go on living. I, the LORD Almighty, have spoken.”"
Jeremiah,8,4,"The LORD told me to say to his people, “When someone falls down, doesn't he get back up? If someone misses the road, doesn't he turn back?"
Jeremiah,8,5,"Why then, my people, do you turn away from me without ever turning back? You cling to your idols and refuse to return to me."
Jeremiah,8,6,"I listened carefully, but you did not speak the truth. Not one of you has been sorry for his wickedness; not one of you has asked, ‘What have I done wrong?’ Everyone keeps on going his own way, like a horse rushing into battle."
Jeremiah,8,7,"Even storks know when it is time to return; doves, swallows, and thrushes know when it is time to migrate. But, my people, you do not know the laws by which I rule you."
Jeremiah,8,8,"How can you say that you are wise, and that you know my laws? Look, the laws have been changed by dishonest scribes."
Jeremiah,8,9,Your wise men are put to shame; they are confused and trapped. They have rejected my words; what wisdom have they got now?
Jeremiah,8,10,"So I will give their fields to new owners and their wives to other men. Everyone, great and small, tries to make money dishonestly. Even prophets and priests cheat the people."
Jeremiah,8,11,"They act as if my people's wounds were only scratches. ‘All is well,’ they say, when all is not well."
Jeremiah,8,12,"My people, were you ashamed because you did these disgusting things? No, you were not ashamed at all; you don't even know how to blush! And so you will fall as others have fallen; when I punish you, that will be the end of you. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Jeremiah,8,13,"“I wanted to gather my people, as a farmer gathers a harvest; but they are like a vine with no grapes, like a fig tree with no figs; even the leaves have withered. Therefore, I have allowed outsiders to take over the land.”"
Jeremiah,8,14,"“Why are we sitting still?” God's people ask. “Come on, we will run to the fortified cities, and die there. The LORD our God has condemned us to die; he has given us poison to drink, because we have sinned against him."
Jeremiah,8,15,"We hoped for peace and a time of healing, but it was no use; terror came instead."
Jeremiah,8,16,"Our enemies are already in the city of Dan; we hear the snorting of their horses. The whole land trembles when their horses neigh. Our enemies have come to destroy our land and everything in it, our city and all its people.”"
Jeremiah,8,17,"“Watch out!” the LORD says, “I am sending snakes among you, poisonous snakes that cannot be charmed, and they will bite you.”"
Jeremiah,8,18,My sorrow cannot be healed; I am sick at heart.
Jeremiah,8,19,"Listen! Throughout the land I hear my people crying out, “Is the LORD no longer in Zion? Is Zion's king no longer there?” The LORD , their king, replies, “Why have you made me angry by worshipping your idols and by bowing down to your useless foreign gods?”"
Jeremiah,8,20,"The people cry out, “The summer is gone, the harvest is over, but we have not been saved.”"
Jeremiah,8,21,My heart has been crushed because my people are crushed; I mourn; I am completely dismayed.
Jeremiah,8,22,"Is there no medicine in Gilead? Are there no doctors there? Why, then, have my people not been healed?"
Jeremiah,9,1,"I wish my head were a well of water, and my eyes a fountain of tears, so that I could cry day and night for my people who have been killed."
Jeremiah,9,2,"I wish I had a place to stay in the desert where I could get away from my people. They are all unfaithful, a mob of traitors."
Jeremiah,9,3,"They are always ready to tell lies; dishonesty instead of truth rules the land. The LORD says, “My people do one evil thing after another, and do not acknowledge me as their God.”"
Jeremiah,9,4,"Everyone must be on guard against his friend, and no one can trust his brother; for every brother is as deceitful as Jacob, and everyone slanders his friends."
Jeremiah,10,1,"People of Israel, listen to the message that the LORD has for you."
Jeremiah,10,2,"He says, “Do not follow the ways of other nations; do not be disturbed by unusual sights in the sky, even though other nations are terrified."
Jeremiah,10,3,"The religion of these people is worthless. A tree is cut down in the forest; it is carved by the tools of the woodcarver,"
Jeremiah,10,4,and decorated with silver and gold. It is fastened down with nails to keep it from falling over.
Jeremiah,10,5,"Such idols are like scarecrows in a field of melons; they cannot speak; they have to be carried because they cannot walk. Do not be afraid of them: they can cause you no harm, and they can do you no good.”"
Jeremiah,10,6," LORD , there is no one like you; you are mighty, and your name is great and powerful."
Jeremiah,10,7," Who would not honour you, the king of all nations? You deserve to be honoured. There is no one like you among all the wise men of the nations or among any of their kings."
Jeremiah,10,8,All of them are stupid and foolish. What can they learn from wooden idols?
Jeremiah,10,9,"Their idols are covered with silver from Spain and with gold from Uphaz, all the work of artists; they are dressed in violet and purple cloth woven by skilled weavers."
Jeremiah,10,10,"But you, LORD , are the true God, you are the living God and the eternal king. When you are angry, the world trembles; the nations cannot endure your anger."
Jeremiah,10,11,(You people must tell them that the gods who did not make the earth and the sky will be destroyed. They will no longer exist anywhere on earth.)
Jeremiah,10,12,The LORD made the earth by his power; by his wisdom he created the world and stretched out the heavens.
Jeremiah,10,13,At his command the waters above the sky roar; he brings clouds from the ends of the earth. He makes lightning flash in the rain and sends the wind from his storeroom.
Jeremiah,10,14,"At the sight of this, people feel stupid and senseless; those who make idols are disillusioned, because the gods they make are false and lifeless."
Jeremiah,10,15,They are worthless and should be despised; they will be destroyed when the LORD comes to deal with them.
Jeremiah,10,16,"The God of Jacob is not like them; he is the one who made everything, and he has chosen Israel to be his very own people. The LORD Almighty is his name."
Jeremiah,10,17,"People of Jerusalem, you are under siege! Gather up your belongings."
Jeremiah,10,18,The LORD is going to throw you out of this land; he is going to crush you until not one of you is left. The LORD has spoken.
Jeremiah,10,19,"The people of Jerusalem cried out, “How badly we are hurt! Our wounds will not heal. And we thought this was something we could endure!"
Jeremiah,10,20,Our tents are ruined; the ropes that held them have broken. Our children have all gone away; there is no one left to put up our tents again; there is no one to hang their curtains.”
Jeremiah,10,21,"I answered, “Our leaders are stupid; they do not ask the LORD for guidance. This is why they have failed, and our people have been scattered."
Jeremiah,10,22,"Listen! News has come! There is a great commotion in a nation to the north; its army will turn the cities of Judah into a desert, a place where jackals live.”"
Jeremiah,10,23," LORD , I know that no one is the master of his own destiny; no person has control over his own life."
Jeremiah,10,24,"Correct your people, LORD; but do not be too hard on us or punish us when you are angry; that would be the end of us."
Jeremiah,10,25,Turn your anger on the nations that do not worship you and on the people who reject you. They have killed your people; they have destroyed us completely and left our country in ruins.
Jeremiah,11,1,"The LORD said to me,"
Jeremiah,11,2,“Listen to the terms of the covenant. Tell the people of Judah and of Jerusalem
Jeremiah,11,3,"that I, the LORD God of Israel, have placed a curse on everyone who does not obey the terms of this covenant."
Jeremiah,11,4,"It is the covenant I made with their ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, the land that was like a blazing furnace to them. I told them to obey me and to do everything that I had commanded. I told them that if they obeyed, they would be my people and I would be their God."
Jeremiah,11,5,"Then I would keep the promise I made to their ancestors that I would give them the rich and fertile land which they now have.” I said, “Yes, LORD .”"
Jeremiah,11,6,"Then the LORD said to me, “Go to the cities of Judah and to the streets of Jerusalem. Proclaim my message there and tell the people to listen to the terms of the covenant and to obey them."
Jeremiah,11,7,"When I brought their ancestors out of Egypt, I solemnly warned them to obey me, and I have kept on warning the people until this day."
Jeremiah,11,8,"But they did not listen or obey. Instead, everyone continued to be as stubborn and evil as ever. I had commanded them to keep the covenant, but they refused. So I brought on them all the punishments described in it.”"
Jeremiah,11,9,"Then the LORD said to me, “The people of Judah and of Jerusalem are plotting against me."
Jeremiah,11,10,"They have gone back to the sins of their ancestors, who refused to do what I said; they have worshipped other gods. Both Israel and Judah have broken the covenant that I made with their ancestors."
Jeremiah,11,11,"So now, I, the LORD , warn them that I am going to bring destruction on them, and they will not escape. And when they cry out to me for help, I will not listen to them."
Jeremiah,11,12,Then the people of Judah and of Jerusalem will go to the gods to whom they offer sacrifices and will cry out to them for help. But those gods will not be able to save them when this destruction comes.
Jeremiah,11,13,"The people of Judah have as many gods as they have cities, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem have set up as many altars for sacrifices to that disgusting god Baal as there are streets in the city."
Jeremiah,11,14,"Jeremiah, don't pray to me or plead with me on behalf of these people. When they are in trouble and call to me for help, I will not listen to them.”"
Jeremiah,11,15,"The LORD says, “The people I love are doing evil things. What right have they to be in my Temple? Do they think they can prevent disaster by making promises and by offering animal sacrifices? Will that make them happy?"
Jeremiah,11,16,"I once called them a leafy olive tree, full of beautiful fruit; but now, with a roar like thunder I will set its leaves on fire and break its branches."
Jeremiah,11,17,"“I, the LORD Almighty, planted Israel and Judah; but now I threaten them with disaster. They have brought this on themselves because they have done wrong; they have made me angry by offering sacrifices to Baal.”"
Jeremiah,11,18,The LORD informed me of the plots that my enemies were making against me.
Jeremiah,11,19,"I was like a trusting lamb taken out to be killed, and I did not know that it was against me that they were planning evil things. They were saying, “Let's chop down the tree while it is still healthy; let's kill him so that no one will remember him any more.”"
Jeremiah,11,20,"Then I prayed, “Almighty LORD , you are a just judge; you test people's thoughts and feelings. I have placed my cause in your hands; so let me watch you take revenge on these people.”"
Jeremiah,11,21,"The people of Anathoth wanted me killed, and they told me that they would kill me if I kept on proclaiming the LORD 's message."
Jeremiah,11,22,"So the LORD Almighty said, “I will punish them! Their young men will be killed in war; their children will die of starvation."
Jeremiah,11,23,"I have set a time for bringing disaster on the people of Anathoth, and when that time comes, none of them will survive.”"
Jeremiah,12,1,"“ LORD , if I argued my case with you, you would prove to be right. Yet I must question you about matters of justice. Why are the wicked so prosperous? Why do dishonest people succeed?"
Jeremiah,12,2,"You plant them, and they take root; they grow and bear fruit. They always speak well of you, yet they do not really care about you."
Jeremiah,12,3,"But, LORD , you know me; you see what I do, and how I love you. Drag these evil people away like sheep to be butchered; guard them until it is time for them to be slaughtered."
Jeremiah,12,4,"How long will our land be dry, and the grass in every field be withered? Animals and birds are dying because of the wickedness of our people, people who say, ‘God doesn't see what we are doing.’ ”"
Jeremiah,12,5,"The LORD said, “Jeremiah, if you get tired racing against people, how can you race against horses? If you can't even stand up in open country, how will you manage in the jungle by the Jordan?"
Jeremiah,12,6,"Even your relatives, members of your own family, have betrayed you; they join in the attacks against you. Do not trust them, even though they speak friendly words.”"
Jeremiah,12,7,"The LORD says, “I have abandoned Israel; I have rejected my chosen nation. I have given the people I love into the power of their enemies."
Jeremiah,12,8,"My chosen people have turned against me; like a lion in the forest they have roared at me, and so I hate them."
Jeremiah,12,9,My chosen people are like a bird attacked from all sides by hawks. Call the wild animals to come and join in the feast!
Jeremiah,12,10,Many foreign rulers have destroyed my vineyard; they have trampled down my fields; they have turned my lovely land into a desert.
Jeremiah,12,11,"They have made it a wilderness; it lies desolate before me. The whole land has become a desert, and no one cares."
Jeremiah,12,12,Across all the desert highlands people have come to plunder. I have sent war to destroy the entire land; no one can live in peace.
Jeremiah,12,13,"My people sowed wheat, but gathered weeds; they have worked hard, but got nothing for it. Because of my fierce anger their crops have failed.”"
Jeremiah,12,14,"The LORD says, “I have something to say about Israel's neighbours who have ruined the land I gave to my people Israel. I will take those wicked people away from their countries like an uprooted plant, and I will rescue Judah from them."
Jeremiah,12,15,"But after I have taken them away, I will have mercy on them; I will bring each nation back to its own land and to its own country."
Jeremiah,12,16,"If with all their hearts they will accept the religion of my people and will swear, ‘As the LORD lives’ — as they once taught my people to swear by Baal — then they will also be a part of my people and will prosper."
Jeremiah,12,17,"But if any nation will not obey, then I will completely uproot it and destroy it. I, the LORD , have spoken.”"
Jeremiah,13,1,The LORD told me to go and buy myself some linen shorts and to put them on; but he told me not to put them in water.
Jeremiah,13,2,So I bought them and put them on.
Jeremiah,13,3,"Then the LORD spoke to me again, and said,"
Jeremiah,13,4,“Go to the River Euphrates and hide the shorts in a hole in the rocks.”
Jeremiah,13,5,So I went and hid them near the Euphrates.
Jeremiah,13,6,Some time later the LORD told me to go back to the Euphrates and get the shorts.
Jeremiah,13,7,"So I went back, and when I found the place where I had hidden them, I saw that they were ruined and were no longer any good."
Jeremiah,13,8,"Then the LORD spoke to me again. He said,"
Jeremiah,13,9,“This is how I will destroy the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah,13,10,"These evil people have refused to obey me. They have been as stubborn and wicked as ever, and have worshipped and served other gods. So then, they will become like these shorts that are no longer any good."
Jeremiah,13,11,"Just as shorts fit tightly round the waist, so I intended all the people of Israel and Judah to hold tightly to me. I did this so that they would be my people and would bring praise and honour to my name; but they would not obey me.”"
Jeremiah,13,12,"The LORD God said to me, “Jeremiah, tell the people of Israel that every wine jar should be filled with wine. They will answer that they know every wine jar should be filled with wine."
Jeremiah,13,13,"Then tell them that I, the LORD , am going to fill the people in this land with wine until they are drunk: the kings, who are David's descendants, the priests, the prophets, and all the people of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,13,14,"Then I will smash them like jars against one another, old and young alike. No pity, compassion, or mercy will stop me from killing them.”"
Jeremiah,13,15,"People of Israel, the LORD has spoken! Be humble and listen to him."
Jeremiah,13,16,"Honour the LORD , your God, before he brings darkness, and you stumble on the mountains; before he turns into deep darkness the light you hoped for."
Jeremiah,13,17,"If you will not listen, I will cry in secret because of your pride; I will cry bitterly, and my tears will flow because the LORD 's people have been taken away as captives."
Jeremiah,13,18,"The LORD said to me, “Tell the king and his mother to come down from their thrones, because their beautiful crowns have fallen from their heads."
Jeremiah,13,19,The towns of southern Judah are under siege; no one can get through to them. All the people of Judah have been taken away into exile.”
Jeremiah,13,20,"Jerusalem, look! Your enemies are coming down from the north! Where are the people entrusted to your care, your people you were so proud of?"
Jeremiah,13,21,What will you say when people you thought were your friends conquer you and rule over you? You will be in pain like a woman giving birth.
Jeremiah,13,22,If you ask why all this has happened to you — why your clothes have been torn off and you have been raped — it is because your sin is so terrible.
Jeremiah,13,23,"Can a Nubian change the colour of his skin, or a leopard remove its spots? If they could, then you that do nothing but evil could learn to do what is right."
Jeremiah,13,24,The LORD will scatter you like straw that is blown away by the desert wind.
Jeremiah,13,25,"He has said that this will be your fate. This is what he has decided to do with you, because you have forgotten him and have trusted in false gods."
Jeremiah,13,26,The LORD himself will strip off your clothes and expose you to shame.
Jeremiah,13,27,"He has seen you do the things he hates. He has seen you go after pagan gods on the hills and in the fields, like a man lusting after his neighbour's wife or like a stallion after a mare. People of Jerusalem, you are doomed! When will you ever be pure?"
Jeremiah,14,1,"The LORD said to me concerning the drought,"
Jeremiah,14,2,"“Judah is in mourning; its cities are dying, its people lie on the ground in sorrow, and Jerusalem cries out for help."
Jeremiah,14,3,"The rich people send their servants for water; they go to the cisterns, but find no water; they come back with their jars empty. Discouraged and confused, they hide their faces."
Jeremiah,14,4,"Because there is no rain and the ground is dried up, the farmers are sick at heart; they hide their faces."
Jeremiah,14,5,In the field the mother deer abandons her newborn fawn because there is no grass.
Jeremiah,14,6,The wild donkeys stand on the hilltops and pant for breath like jackals; their eyesight fails them because they have no food.
Jeremiah,14,7,"My people cry out to me, ‘Even though our sins accuse us, help us, LORD , as you have promised. We have turned away from you many times; we have sinned against you."
Jeremiah,14,8,"You are Israel's only hope; you are the one who saves us from disaster. Why are you like a stranger in our land, like a traveller who stays for only one night?"
Jeremiah,14,9,"Why are you like someone taken by surprise, like a soldier powerless to help? Surely, LORD , you are with us! We are your people; do not abandon us.’ ”"
Jeremiah,14,10,"The LORD says about these people, “They love to run away from me, and they will not control themselves. So I am not pleased with them. I will remember the wrongs they have done and punish them because of their sins.”"
Jeremiah,14,11,"The LORD said to me, “Do not ask me to help these people."
Jeremiah,14,12,"Even if they fast, I will not listen to their cry for help; and even if they offer me burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not be pleased with them. Instead, I will kill them in war and by starvation and disease.”"
Jeremiah,14,13,"Then I said, “Sovereign LORD , you know that the prophets are telling the people that there will be no war or starvation, because you have promised, they say, that there will be only peace in our land.”"
Jeremiah,14,14,"But the LORD replied, “The prophets are telling lies in my name; I did not send them, nor did I give them any orders or speak one word to them. The visions they talk about have not come from me; their predictions are worthless things that they have imagined."
Jeremiah,14,15,"I, the LORD , tell you what I am going to do to those prophets whom I did not send but who speak in my name and say war and starvation will not strike this land — I will kill them in war and by starvation."
Jeremiah,14,16,"The people to whom they have said these things will be killed in the same way. Their bodies will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem, and there will be no one to bury them. This will happen to all of them — including their wives, their sons, and their daughters. I will make them pay for their wickedness.”"
Jeremiah,14,17,"The LORD commanded me to tell the people about my sorrow and to say: “May my eyes flow with tears day and night, may I never stop weeping, for my people are deeply wounded and are badly hurt."
Jeremiah,14,18,"When I go out into the fields, I see the bodies of men killed in war; when I go into the towns, I see people starving to death. Prophets and priests carry on their work, but they don't know what they are doing.”"
Jeremiah,14,19," LORD , have you completely rejected Judah? Do you hate the people of Zion? Why have you hurt us so badly that we cannot be healed? We looked for peace, but nothing good happened; we hoped for healing, but terror came instead."
Jeremiah,14,20,"We have sinned against you, LORD; we confess our own sins and the sins of our ancestors."
Jeremiah,14,21,"Remember your promises and do not despise us; do not bring disgrace on Jerusalem, the place of your glorious throne. Do not break the covenant you made with us."
Jeremiah,14,22,"None of the idols of the nations can send rain; the sky by itself cannot make showers fall. We have put our hope in you, O LORD our God, because you are the one who does these things."
Jeremiah,15,1," Then the LORD said to me, “Even if Moses and Samuel were standing here pleading with me, I would not show these people any mercy. Make them go away; make them get out of my sight."
Jeremiah,15,2,"When they ask you where they should go, tell them that I have said: Some are doomed to die by disease — that's where they will go! Others are doomed to die in war — that's where they will go! Some are doomed to die of starvation — that's where they will go! Others are doomed to be taken away as prisoners — that's where they will go!"
Jeremiah,15,3,"I, the LORD , have decided that four terrible things will happen to them: they will be killed in war; their bodies will be dragged off by dogs; birds will eat them, and wild animals will devour what is left over."
Jeremiah,15,4,I will make all the people of the world horrified at them because of what Hezekiah's son Manasseh did in Jerusalem when he was king of Judah.”
Jeremiah,15,5,"The LORD says, “Who will pity you, people of Jerusalem, and who will grieve over you? Who will stop long enough to ask how you are?"
Jeremiah,15,6,You people have rejected me; you have turned your backs on me. So I stretched out my hand and crushed you because I was tired of controlling my anger.
Jeremiah,15,7,"In every town in the land I threw you to the wind like straw. I destroyed you, my people, I killed your children because you did not stop your evil ways."
Jeremiah,15,8,There are more widows in your land than grains of sand by the sea. I killed your young men in their prime and made their mothers suffer. I suddenly struck them with anguish and terror.
Jeremiah,15,9,"The mother who lost her seven children has fainted, gasping for breath. Her daylight has turned to darkness; she is disgraced and sick at heart. I will let your enemies kill those of you who are still alive. I, the LORD , have spoken.”"
Jeremiah,15,10,What an unhappy man I am! Why did my mother bring me into the world? I have to quarrel and argue with everyone in the land. I have not lent any money or borrowed any; yet everyone curses me.
Jeremiah,15,11,"LORD , may all their curses come true if I have not served you well, if I have not pleaded with you on behalf of my enemies when they were in trouble and distress."
Jeremiah,15,12,"(No one can break iron, especially the iron from the north that is mixed with bronze.)"

Jeremiah,15,14,"I will make them serve their enemies in a land they know nothing about, because my anger is like fire, and it will burn for ever.”"
Jeremiah,15,15,"Then I said, “ LORD , you understand. Remember me and help me. Let me have revenge on those who persecute me. Do not be so patient with them that they succeed in killing me. Remember that it is for your sake that I am insulted."
Jeremiah,15,16,"You spoke to me, and I listened to every word. I belong to you, LORD God Almighty, and so your words filled my heart with joy and happiness."
Jeremiah,15,17,"I did not spend my time with other people, laughing and having a good time. In obedience to your orders I stayed by myself and was filled with anger."
Jeremiah,15,18,Why do I keep on suffering? Why are my wounds incurable? Why won't they heal? Do you intend to disappoint me like a stream that goes dry in the summer?”
Jeremiah,15,19,"To this the LORD replied, “If you return, I will take you back, and you will be my servant again. If instead of talking nonsense you proclaim a worthwhile message, you will be my prophet again. The people will come back to you, and you will not need to go to them."
Jeremiah,15,20,"I will make you like a solid bronze wall as far as they are concerned. They will fight against you, but they will not defeat you. I will be with you to protect you and keep you safe."
Jeremiah,15,21,"I will rescue you from the power of wicked and violent people. I, the LORD , have spoken.”"
Jeremiah,16,1,"Again the LORD spoke to me and said,"
Jeremiah,16,2,“Do not marry or have children in a place like this.
Jeremiah,16,3,I will tell you what is going to happen to the children who are born here and to their parents.
Jeremiah,16,4,"They will die of terrible diseases, and no one will mourn for them or bury them. Their bodies will lie like piles of manure on the ground. They will be killed in war or die of starvation, and their bodies will be food for the birds and the wild animals."
Jeremiah,16,5,“You must not enter a house where there is mourning. Do not grieve for anyone. I will no longer bless my people with peace or show them love and mercy.
Jeremiah,16,6,"The rich and the poor will die in this land, but no one will bury them or mourn for them. No one will gash himself or shave his head to show his grief."
Jeremiah,16,7,"No one will eat or drink with anyone to comfort him when a loved one dies. No one will show sympathy, not even for someone who has lost his father or mother."
Jeremiah,16,8,“Do not enter a house where people are feasting. Do not sit down with them to eat and drink.
Jeremiah,16,9,"Listen to what I, the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, have to say. I will silence the sounds of joy and gladness and the happy sounds of wedding feasts. The people here will live to see this happen."
Jeremiah,16,10,"“When you tell them all this, they will ask you why I have decided to punish them so harshly. They will ask what crime they are guilty of and what sin they have committed against the LORD their God."
Jeremiah,16,11,"Then tell them that the LORD has said, ‘Your ancestors turned away from me and worshipped and served other gods. They abandoned me and did not obey my teachings."
Jeremiah,16,12,"But you have done even worse than your ancestors. All of you are stubborn and evil, and you do not obey me."
Jeremiah,16,13,"So then, I will throw you out of this land into a land that neither you nor your ancestors have ever known. And there you will serve other gods day and night, and I will show you no mercy.’ ”"
Jeremiah,16,14,"The LORD says, “The time is coming when people will no longer swear by me as the living God who brought the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt."
Jeremiah,16,15,"Instead, they will swear by me as the living God who brought the people of Israel out of a northern land and out of all the other countries where I had scattered them. I will bring them back to their own country, to the land that I gave their ancestors. I, the LORD , have spoken.”"
Jeremiah,16,16,"The LORD says, “I am sending for many fishermen to come and catch these people. Then I will send for many hunters to hunt them down on every mountain and hill and in the caves among the rocks."
Jeremiah,16,17,I see everything they do. Nothing is hidden from me; their sins do not escape my sight.
Jeremiah,16,18,"I will make them pay double for their sin and wickedness, because they have defiled my land with idols that are as lifeless as corpses, and have filled it with their false gods.”"
Jeremiah,16,19," LORD , you are the one who protects me and gives me strength; you help me in times of trouble. Nations will come to you from the ends of the earth and say, “Our ancestors had nothing but false gods, nothing but useless idols."
Jeremiah,16,20,"Can people make their own gods? No, if they did, those would not really be gods.”"
Jeremiah,16,21,"“So then,” says the LORD , “once and for all I will make the nations know my power and my might; they will know that I am the LORD .”"
Jeremiah,17,1,"The LORD says, “People of Judah, your sin is written with an iron pen; it is engraved on your hearts with a diamond point and carved on the corners of your altars."
Jeremiah,17,2,"Your people worship at the altars and the symbols that have been set up for the goddess Asherah by every green tree, on the hilltops"
Jeremiah,17,3,and on the mountains in the open country. I will make your enemies take away your wealth and your treasures because of all the sins you have committed throughout your land.

Jeremiah,17,11,"The person who gets money dishonestly is like a bird that hatches eggs it didn't lay. In the prime of life he will lose his riches, and in the end he is nothing but a fool."
Jeremiah,17,12,"Our Temple is like a glorious throne, standing on a high mountain from the beginning."
Jeremiah,17,13," LORD , you are Israel's hope; all who abandon you will be put to shame. They will disappear like names written in the dust, because they have abandoned you, the LORD, the spring of fresh water."
Jeremiah,17,14," LORD , heal me and I will be completely well; rescue me and I will be perfectly safe. You are the one I praise!"
Jeremiah,17,15,"The people say to me, “Where are those threats the LORD made against us? Let him carry them out now!”"
Jeremiah,17,16,"But, LORD , I never urged you to bring disaster on them; I did not wish a time of trouble for them. LORD , you know this; you know what I have said."
Jeremiah,17,17,Do not be a terror to me; you are my place of safety when trouble comes.
Jeremiah,17,18,"Bring disgrace on those who persecute me, but spare me, LORD . Fill them with terror, but do not terrify me. Bring disaster on them and break them to pieces."
Jeremiah,17,19,"The LORD said to me, “Jeremiah, go and announce my message at the People's Gate, through which the kings of Judah enter and leave the city; then go to all the other gates of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,17,20,"Tell the kings and all the people of Judah and everyone who lives in Jerusalem and enters these gates, to listen to what I say."
Jeremiah,17,21,"Tell them that if they love their lives, they must not carry any load on the Sabbath; they must not carry anything in through the gates of Jerusalem"
Jeremiah,17,22,"or carry anything out of their houses on the Sabbath. They must not work on the Sabbath; they must observe it as a sacred day, as I commanded their ancestors."
Jeremiah,17,23,"Their ancestors did not listen to me or pay any attention. Instead, they became stubborn; they would not obey me or learn from me."
Jeremiah,17,24,“Tell these people that they must obey all my commands. They must not carry any load in through the gates of this city on the Sabbath. They must observe the Sabbath as a sacred day and must not do any work at all.

Jeremiah,17,26,"People will come from the towns of Judah and from the villages round Jerusalem; they will come from the territory of Benjamin, from the foothills, from the mountains, and from southern Judah. They will bring to my Temple burnt offerings and sacrifices, grain offerings and incense, as well as thank-offerings."
Jeremiah,17,27,"But they must obey me and observe the Sabbath as a sacred day. They must not carry any load through the gates of Jerusalem on that day, for if they do, I will set the gates of Jerusalem on fire. Fire will burn down the palaces of Jerusalem, and no one will be able to put it out.”"
Jeremiah,18,1,"The LORD said to me,"
Jeremiah,18,2,"“Go down to the potter's house, where I will give you my message.”"
Jeremiah,18,3,So I went there and saw the potter working at his wheel.
Jeremiah,18,4,"Whenever a piece of pottery turned out imperfect, he would take the clay and make it into something else."
Jeremiah,18,5,"Then the LORD said to me,"
Jeremiah,18,6,“Haven't I the right to do with you people of Israel what the potter did with the clay? You are in my hands just like clay in the potter's hands.
Jeremiah,18,7,"If at any time I say that I am going to uproot, break down, or destroy any nation or kingdom,"
Jeremiah,18,8,"but then that nation turns from its evil, I will not do what I said I would."
Jeremiah,18,9,"On the other hand, if I say that I am going to plant or build up any nation or kingdom,"
Jeremiah,18,10,"but then that nation disobeys me and does evil, I will not do what I said I would."
Jeremiah,18,11,"Now then, tell the people of Judah and of Jerusalem that I am making plans against them and getting ready to punish them. Tell them to stop living sinful lives — to change their ways and the things they are doing."
Jeremiah,18,12,"They will answer, ‘No, why should we? We will all be just as stubborn and evil as we want to be.’ ”"
Jeremiah,18,13,"The LORD says, “Ask every nation if such a thing has ever happened before. The people of Israel have done a terrible thing!"
Jeremiah,18,14,Are Lebanon's rocky heights ever without snow? Do its cool mountain streams ever run dry?
Jeremiah,18,15,"Yet my people have forgotten me; they burn incense to idols. They have stumbled in the way they should go, they no longer follow the old ways; they walk on unmarked paths."
Jeremiah,18,16,"They have made this land a thing of horror, to be despised for ever. All who pass by will be shocked at what they see; they will shake their heads in amazement."
Jeremiah,18,17,"I will scatter my people before their enemies, like dust blown by the east wind. I will turn my back on them; I will not help them when the disaster comes.”"
Jeremiah,18,18,"Then the people said, “Let's do something about Jeremiah! There will always be priests to instruct us, the wise to give us counsel, and prophets to proclaim God's message. Let's bring charges against him, and stop listening to what he says.”"
Jeremiah,18,19,"So I prayed, “ LORD , hear what I am saying and listen to what my enemies are saying about me."
Jeremiah,18,20,"Is evil the payment for good? Yet they have dug a pit for me to fall in. Remember how I came to you and spoke on their behalf, so that you would not deal with them in anger."
Jeremiah,18,21,"But now, LORD , let their children starve to death; let them be killed in war. Let the women lose their husbands and children; let the men die of disease and the young men be killed in battle."
Jeremiah,18,22,Send a mob to plunder their homes without warning; make them cry out in terror. They have dug a pit for me to fall in and have set traps to catch me.
Jeremiah,18,23,"But, LORD , you know all their plots to kill me. Do not forgive their evil or pardon their sin. Throw them down in defeat and deal with them while you are angry.”"
Jeremiah,19,1,"The LORD told me to go and buy a clay jar. He also told me to take some of the elders of the people and some of the older priests,"
Jeremiah,19,2,and to go through Potsherd Gate out to the Valley of Hinnom. There I was to proclaim the message that he would give me.
Jeremiah,19,3,"The LORD told me to say, “Kings of Judah and people of Jerusalem, listen to what I, the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, have to say. I am going to bring such a disaster on this place that everyone who hears about it will be stunned."
Jeremiah,19,4,"I am going to do this because the people have abandoned me and defiled this place by offering sacrifices here to other gods — gods that neither they nor their ancestors nor the kings of Judah have known anything about. They have filled this place with the blood of innocent people,"
Jeremiah,19,5,and they have built altars for Baal in order to burn their children in the fire as sacrifices. I never commanded them to do this; it never even entered my mind.
Jeremiah,19,6,"So then, the time will come when this place will no longer be called Topheth or the Valley of Hinnom. Instead, it will be known as the Valley of Slaughter."
Jeremiah,19,7,In this place I will frustrate all the plans of the people of Judah and Jerusalem. I will let their enemies triumph over them and kill them in battle. I will give their corpses to the birds and the wild animals as food.
Jeremiah,19,8,I will bring such terrible destruction on this city that everyone who passes by will be shocked and amazed.
Jeremiah,19,9,The enemy will surround the city and try to kill its people. The siege will be so terrible that the people inside the city will eat one another and even their own children.”
Jeremiah,19,10,Then the LORD told me to break the jar in front of those who had gone with me
Jeremiah,19,11,"and to tell them that the LORD Almighty had said, “I will break this people and this city, and it will be like this broken clay jar that cannot be put together again. People will bury their dead even in Topheth because there will be nowhere else to bury them."
Jeremiah,19,12,I promise that I will make this city and its inhabitants like Topheth.
Jeremiah,19,13,"The houses of Jerusalem, the houses of the kings of Judah, and indeed all the houses on whose roofs incense has been burnt to the stars and where wine has been poured out as an offering to other gods — they will all be as unclean as Topheth.”"
Jeremiah,19,14,"Then I left Topheth, where the LORD had sent me to proclaim his message. I went and stood in the court of the Temple and told all the people"
Jeremiah,19,15,"that the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, had said, “I am going to bring on this city and on every nearby town all the punishment that I said I would, because you are stubborn and will not listen to what I say.”"
Jeremiah,20,1,"When the priest Pashhur son of Immer, who was the chief officer of the Temple, heard me proclaim these things,"
Jeremiah,20,2,he ordered me to be beaten and placed in chains near the upper Benjamin Gate in the Temple.
Jeremiah,20,3,"The next morning, after Pashhur had released me from the chains, I said to him, “The LORD did not name you Pashhur. The name he has given you is ‘Terror Everywhere’."
Jeremiah,20,4,"The LORD himself has said, ‘I am going to make you a terror to yourself and to your friends, and you will see them all killed by the swords of their enemies. I am going to put all the people of Judah under the power of the king of Babylonia; he will take some away as prisoners to his country and put others to death."
Jeremiah,20,5,"I will also let their enemies plunder all the wealth of this city and seize all its possessions and property, even the treasures of the kings of Judah, and carry everything off to Babylonia."
Jeremiah,20,6,"As for you, Pashhur, you and all your family will also be captured and taken off to Babylonia. There you will die and be buried, along with all your friends to whom you have told so many lies.’ ”"
Jeremiah,20,7," LORD , you have deceived me, and I was deceived. You are stronger than I am, and you have overpowered me. Everyone jeers at me; they mock me all day long."
Jeremiah,20,8,"Whenever I speak, I have to cry out and shout, “Violence! Destruction!” LORD , I am ridiculed and scorned all the time because I proclaim your message."
Jeremiah,20,9,"But when I say, “I will forget the LORD and no longer speak in his name,” then your message is like a fire burning deep within me. I try my best to hold it in, but can no longer keep it back."
Jeremiah,20,10,"I hear everybody whispering, “Terror is everywhere! So let's report him to the authorities!” Even my close friends wait for my downfall. “Perhaps he can be tricked,” they say; “then we can catch him and get revenge.”"
Jeremiah,20,11,"But you, LORD , are on my side, strong and mighty, and those who persecute me will fail. They will be disgraced for ever, because they cannot succeed. Their disgrace will never be forgotten."
Jeremiah,20,12,"But, Almighty LORD , you test people justly; you know what is in their hearts and minds. So let me see you take revenge on my enemies, for I have placed my cause in your hands."
Jeremiah,20,13,Sing to the LORD! Praise the LORD! He rescues the oppressed from the power of evil people.
Jeremiah,20,14, Curse the day I was born! Forget the day my mother gave me birth!
Jeremiah,20,15,"Curse the one who made my father glad by bringing him the news, “It's a boy! You have a son!”"
Jeremiah,20,16,"May he be like those cities that the LORD destroyed without mercy. May he hear cries of pain in the morning and the battle alarm at noon,"
Jeremiah,20,17,because he didn't kill me before I was born. Then my mother's womb would have been my grave.
Jeremiah,20,18,"Why was I born? Was it only to have trouble and sorrow, to end my life in disgrace?"
Jeremiah,21,1,King Zedekiah of Judah sent Pashhur son of Malchiah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah to me with this request:
Jeremiah,21,2,"“Please speak to the LORD for us, because King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia and his army are besieging the city. Maybe the LORD will perform one of his miracles for us and force Nebuchadnezzar to retreat.”"
Jeremiah,21,3,"Then the LORD spoke to me, and I told the men who had been sent to me"
Jeremiah,21,4,"to tell Zedekiah that the LORD , the God of Israel, had said, “Zedekiah, I am going to defeat your army that is fighting against the king of Babylonia and his army. I will pile up your soldiers' weapons in the centre of the city."
Jeremiah,21,5,"I will fight against you with all my might, my anger, my wrath, and my fury."
Jeremiah,21,6,I will kill everyone living in this city; people and animals alike will die of a terrible disease.
Jeremiah,21,7,"But as for you, your officials, and the people who survive the war, the famine, and the disease — I will let all of you be captured by King Nebuchadnezzar and by your enemies, who want to kill you. Nebuchadnezzar will put you to death. He will not spare any of you or show mercy or pity to any of you. I, the LORD , have spoken.”"
Jeremiah,21,8,"Then the LORD told me to say to the people, “Listen! I, the LORD , am giving you a choice between the way that leads to life and the way that leads to death."
Jeremiah,21,9,"Anyone who stays in the city will be killed in war or by starvation or disease. But those who go out and surrender to the Babylonians, who are now attacking the city, will not be killed; they will at least escape with their lives."
Jeremiah,21,10,"I have made up my mind not to spare this city, but to destroy it. It will be given over to the king of Babylonia and he will burn it to the ground. I, the LORD , have spoken.”"
Jeremiah,23,1,How terrible will be the LORD 's judgement on those rulers who destroy and scatter his people!
Jeremiah,23,2,"This is what the LORD , the God of Israel, says about the rulers who were supposed to take care of his people: “You have not taken care of my people; you have scattered them and driven them away. Now I am going to punish you for the evil you have done."
Jeremiah,23,3,"I will gather the rest of my people from the countries where I have scattered them, and I will bring them back to their homeland. They will have many children and increase in number."
Jeremiah,23,4,"I will appoint rulers to take care of them. My people will no longer be afraid or terrified, and I will not punish them again. I, the LORD , have spoken.”"
Jeremiah,23,5," The LORD says, “The time is coming when I will choose as king a righteous descendant of David. That king will rule wisely and do what is right and just throughout the land."
Jeremiah,23,6,"When he is king, the people of Judah will be safe, and the people of Israel will live in peace. He will be called ‘The LORD Our Salvation’."
Jeremiah,23,7,"“The time is coming,” says the LORD , “when people will no longer swear by me as the living God who brought the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt."
Jeremiah,23,8,"Instead, they will swear by me as the living God who brought the people of Israel out of a northern land and out of all the other countries where I had scattered them. Then they will live in their own land.”"
Jeremiah,23,9,"My heart is crushed, and I am trembling. Because of the LORD, because of his holy words, I am like a man who is drunk, a man who has had too much wine."
Jeremiah,23,10,The land is full of people unfaithful to the LORD; they live wicked lives and misuse their power. Because of the LORD 's curse the land mourns and the pastures are dry.
Jeremiah,23,11,"The LORD says, “The prophets and the priests are godless; I have caught them doing evil in the Temple itself."
Jeremiah,23,12,"The paths they follow will be slippery and dark; I will make them stumble and fall. I am going to bring disaster on them; the time of their punishment is coming. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Jeremiah,23,13,I have seen the sin of Samaria's prophets: they have spoken in the name of Baal and have led my people astray.
Jeremiah,23,14," But I have seen the prophets in Jerusalem do even worse: they commit adultery and tell lies; they help people to do wrong, so that no one stops doing what is evil. To me, they are all as bad as the people of Sodom and Gomorrah."
Jeremiah,23,15,"“So then, this is what I, the LORD Almighty, say about the prophets of Jerusalem: I will give them bitter plants to eat and poison to drink, because they have spread ungodliness throughout the land.”"
Jeremiah,23,16,"The LORD Almighty said to the people of Jerusalem, “Do not listen to what the prophets say; they are filling you with false hopes. They tell you what they have imagined and not what I have said."
Jeremiah,23,17,"To the people who refuse to listen to what I have said, they keep saying that all will go well with them. And they tell everyone who is stubborn that disaster will never touch him.”"
Jeremiah,23,18,"I said, “None of these prophets has ever known the LORD 's secret thoughts. None of them has ever heard or understood his message, or ever listened or paid attention to what he said."
Jeremiah,23,19,"His anger is a storm, a furious wind that will rage over the heads of the wicked,"
Jeremiah,23,20,and it will not end until he has done everything he intends to do. In days to come his people will understand this clearly.”
Jeremiah,23,21,"The LORD said, “I did not send these prophets, but even so they went. I did not give them any message, but still they spoke in my name."
Jeremiah,23,22,"If they had known my secret thoughts, then they could have proclaimed my message to my people and could have made them give up the evil lives they live and the wicked things they do."
Jeremiah,23,23,“I am a God who is everywhere and not in one place only.
Jeremiah,23,24,No one can hide where I cannot see him. Do you not know that I am everywhere in heaven and on earth?
Jeremiah,23,25,I know what those prophets have said who speak lies in my name and claim that I have given them my messages in their dreams.
Jeremiah,23,26,How much longer will those prophets mislead my people with the lies they have invented?
Jeremiah,23,27,"They think that the dreams they tell will make my people forget me, just as their ancestors forgot me and turned to Baal."
Jeremiah,23,28,"The prophet who has had a dream should say it is only a dream, but the prophet who has heard my message should proclaim that message faithfully. What good is straw compared with wheat?"
Jeremiah,23,29,"My message is like a fire, and like a hammer that breaks rocks in pieces."
Jeremiah,23,30,I am against those prophets who take each other's words and proclaim them as my message.
Jeremiah,23,31,I am also against those prophets who speak their own words and claim they came from me.
Jeremiah,23,32,"Listen to what I, the LORD , say! I am against the prophets who tell their dreams that are full of lies. They tell these dreams and lead my people astray with their lies and their boasting. I did not send them or order them to go, and they are of no help at all to the people. I, the LORD , have spoken.”"
Jeremiah,23,33,"The LORD said to me, “Jeremiah, when one of my people or a prophet or a priest asks you, ‘What is the LORD 's message?’ you are to tell him, ‘You are a burden to the LORD , and he is going to get rid of you.’"
Jeremiah,23,34,"If any of my people or a prophet or a priest even uses the words ‘the LORD 's burden’, I will punish them and their families."
Jeremiah,23,35,"Instead, they should each ask their friends and relatives, ‘What answer has the LORD given? What has the LORD said?’"
Jeremiah,23,36,"So they must no longer use the words ‘the LORD 's burden’, because if anyone does, I will make my message a real burden to him. The people have perverted the words of their God, the living God, the LORD Almighty."
Jeremiah,23,37,"Jeremiah, ask the prophets, ‘What answer did the LORD give you? What did the LORD say?’"
Jeremiah,23,38,"And if they disobey my command and use the words ‘the LORD 's burden’, then tell them that"
Jeremiah,23,39,"I will certainly pick them up and throw them far away from me, both them and the city that I gave to them and their ancestors."
Jeremiah,23,40,I will bring on them everlasting shame and disgrace that will never be forgotten.”
Jeremiah,24,1," The LORD showed me two baskets of figs placed in front of the Temple. (This was after King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia had taken away Jehoiakim's son, King Jehoiachin of Judah, as a prisoner from Jerusalem to Babylonia, together with the leaders of Judah, the craftsmen, and the skilled workers.)"
Jeremiah,24,2,"The first basket contained good figs, those that ripen early; the other one contained bad figs, too bad to eat."
Jeremiah,24,3,"Then the LORD said to me, “Jeremiah, what do you see?” I answered, “Figs. The good ones are very good, and the bad ones are very bad, too bad to eat.”"
Jeremiah,24,4,"So the LORD said to me,"
Jeremiah,24,5,"“I, the LORD , the God of Israel, consider that the people who were taken away to Babylonia are like these good figs, and I will treat them with kindness."
Jeremiah,24,6,I will watch over them and bring them back to this land. I will build them up and not tear them down; I will plant them and not pull them up.
Jeremiah,24,7,"I will give them the desire to know that I am the LORD . Then they will be my people, and I will be their God, because they will return to me with all their heart."
Jeremiah,24,8,"“As for King Zedekiah of Judah, the politicians round him, and the rest of the people of Jerusalem who have stayed in this land or moved to Egypt — I, the LORD , will treat them all like these figs that are too bad to be eaten."
Jeremiah,24,9,"I will bring such a disaster on them that all the nations of the world will be terrified. People will mock them, make jokes about them, ridicule them, and use their name as a curse everywhere I scatter them."
Jeremiah,24,10,"I will bring war, starvation, and disease on them until there is not one of them left in the land that I gave to them and their ancestors.”"
Jeremiah,25,1," In the fourth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was king of Judah, I received a message from the LORD concerning all the people of Judah. (This was the first year that Nebuchadnezzar was king of Babylonia.)"
Jeremiah,25,2,"I said to all the people of Judah and of Jerusalem,"
Jeremiah,25,3,"“For 23 years, from the thirteenth year that Josiah son of Amon was king of Judah until this very day, the LORD has spoken to me, and I have never failed to tell you what he said. But you have paid no attention."
Jeremiah,25,4,"You would not listen or pay attention, even though the LORD has continued to send you his servants the prophets."
Jeremiah,25,5,"They told you to turn from your wicked way of life and from the evil things you are doing, so that you could go on living in the land that the LORD gave you and your ancestors as a permanent possession."
Jeremiah,25,6,"They told you not to worship and serve other gods and not to make the LORD angry by worshipping the idols you had made. If you had obeyed the LORD , then he would not have punished you."
Jeremiah,25,7,"But the LORD himself says that you refused to listen to him. Instead, you made him angry with your idols and have brought his punishment on yourselves."
Jeremiah,25,8,"“So then, because you would not listen to him, the LORD Almighty says,"
Jeremiah,25,9,"‘I am going to send for all the peoples from the north and for my servant, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia. I am going to bring them to fight against Judah and its inhabitants and against all the neighbouring nations. I am going to destroy this nation and its neighbours and leave them in ruins for ever, a terrible and shocking sight. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Jeremiah,25,10,"I will silence their shouts of joy and gladness and the happy sounds of wedding feasts. They will have no oil for their lamps, and there will be no more corn."
Jeremiah,25,11,"This whole land will be left in ruins and will be a shocking sight, and the neighbouring nations will serve the king of Babylonia for seventy years."
Jeremiah,25,12,After that I will punish Babylonia and its king for their sin. I will destroy that country and leave it in ruins for ever.
Jeremiah,25,13,I will punish Babylonia with all the disasters that I threatened to bring on the nations when I spoke through Jeremiah — all the disasters recorded in this book.
Jeremiah,25,14,"I will pay the Babylonians back for what they have done, and many nations and great kings will make slaves of them.’ ”"
Jeremiah,25,15,"The LORD , the God of Israel, said to me, “Here is a wine cup filled with my anger. Take it to all the nations to whom I send you, and make them drink from it."
Jeremiah,25,16,"When they drink from it, they will stagger and go out of their minds because of the war I am sending against them.”"
Jeremiah,25,17,"So I took the cup from the LORD 's hand, gave it to all the nations to whom the LORD had sent me, and made them drink from it."
Jeremiah,25,18,"Jerusalem and all the towns of Judah, together with its kings and leaders, were made to drink from it, so that they would become a desert, a terrible and shocking sight, and so that people would use their name as a curse — as they still do."
Jeremiah,26,1," Soon after Jehoiakim son of Josiah became king of Judah,"
Jeremiah,26,2,"the LORD said to me, “Stand in the court of the Temple and proclaim all I have commanded you to say to the people who come from the towns of Judah to worship there. Do not leave out anything."
Jeremiah,26,3,"Perhaps the people will listen and give up their evil ways. If they do, then I will change my mind about the destruction I plan to bring on them for all their wicked deeds.”"
Jeremiah,26,4,"The LORD told me to say to the people, “I, the LORD , have said that you must obey me by following the teaching that I gave you,"
Jeremiah,26,5,"and by paying attention to the words of my servants, the prophets, whom I have kept on sending to you. You have never obeyed what they said."
Jeremiah,26,6,"If you continue to disobey, then I will do to this Temple what I did to Shiloh, and all the nations of the world will use the name of this city as a curse.”"
Jeremiah,26,7,"The priests, the prophets, and all the people heard me saying these things in the Temple,"
Jeremiah,26,8,"and as soon as I had finished all that the LORD had commanded me to speak, they seized me and shouted, “You ought to be killed for this!"
Jeremiah,26,9,Why have you said in the LORD 's name that this Temple will become like Shiloh and that this city will be destroyed and no one will live in it?” Then the people crowded round me.
Jeremiah,26,10,"When the leaders of Judah heard what had happened, they hurried from the royal palace to the Temple and took their places at the New Gate."
Jeremiah,26,11,"Then the priests and the prophets said to the leaders and to the people, “This man deserves to be sentenced to death because he has spoken against our city. You heard him with your own ears.”"
Jeremiah,26,12,"Then I said, “The LORD sent me to proclaim everything that you heard me say against this Temple and against this city."
Jeremiah,26,13,"You must change the way you are living and the things you are doing, and must obey the LORD your God. If you do, he will change his mind about the destruction that he said he would bring on you."
Jeremiah,26,14,"As for me, I am in your power! Do with me whatever you think is fair and right."
Jeremiah,26,15,"But be sure of this: if you kill me, you and the people of this city will be guilty of killing an innocent man, because it is the LORD who sent me to give you this warning.”"
Jeremiah,26,16,"Then the leaders and the people said to the priests and the prophets, “This man spoke to us in the name of the LORD our God; he should not be put to death.”"
Jeremiah,26,17,"After that, some of the elders stood up and said to the people who had assembled,"
Jeremiah,26,18,"“When Hezekiah was king of Judah, the prophet Micah of Moresheth told all the people that the LORD Almighty had said, ‘Zion will be ploughed like a field, Jerusalem will become a pile of ruins, and the Temple hill will become a forest.’"
Jeremiah,26,19,"King Hezekiah and the people of Judah did not put Micah to death. Instead, Hezekiah honoured the LORD and tried to win his favour. And the LORD changed his mind about the disaster that he said he would bring on them. Now we are about to bring a terrible disaster on ourselves.”"
Jeremiah,26,20,"(There was another man, Uriah son of Shemaiah from Kiriath Jearim, who spoke in the name of the LORD against this city and nation just as Jeremiah did."
Jeremiah,26,21,"When King Jehoiakim and his soldiers and officials heard what Uriah had said, the king tried to have him killed. But Uriah heard about it; so he fled in terror and escaped to Egypt."
Jeremiah,26,22,"King Jehoiakim, however, sent Elnathan son of Achbor and some other men to Egypt to get Uriah."
Jeremiah,26,23,"They brought him back to King Jehoiakim, who had him killed and his body thrown into the public burial ground.)"
Jeremiah,26,24,"But because I had the support of Ahikam son of Shaphan, I was not handed over to the people and killed."
Jeremiah,27,1," Soon after Josiah's son Zedekiah became king of Judah, the LORD told me"
Jeremiah,27,2,to make myself a yoke out of leather straps and wooden crossbars and to put it on my neck.
Jeremiah,27,3,"Then the LORD told me to send a message to the kings of Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Sidon through their ambassadors who had come to Jerusalem to see King Zedekiah."
Jeremiah,27,4,"The LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, told me to command them to tell their kings that the LORD had said:"
Jeremiah,27,5,"“By my great power and strength I created the world, the human race, and all the animals that live on the earth; and I give it to anyone I choose."
Jeremiah,27,6,"I am the one who has placed all these nations under the power of my servant, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia, and I have made even the wild animals serve him."
Jeremiah,27,7,"All nations will serve him, and they will serve his son and his grandson until the time comes for his own nation to fall. Then his nation will serve powerful nations and great kings."
Jeremiah,27,8,"“But if any nation or kingdom will not submit to his rule, then I will punish that nation by war, starvation, and disease until I have let Nebuchadnezzar destroy it completely."
Jeremiah,27,9,"Do not listen to your prophets or to anyone who claims he can predict the future, either by dreams or by calling up the spirits of the dead or by magic. They all tell you not to submit to the king of Babylonia."
Jeremiah,27,10,"They are deceiving you and will cause you to be taken far away from your country. I will drive you out, and you will be destroyed."
Jeremiah,27,11,"But if any nation submits to the king of Babylonia and serves him, then I will let it stay on in its own land, to farm it and live there. I, the LORD , have spoken.”"
Jeremiah,27,12,"I said the same thing to King Zedekiah of Judah, “Submit to the king of Babylonia. Serve him and his people, and you will live."
Jeremiah,27,13,Why should you and your people die in war or of starvation or disease? That is what the LORD has said will happen to any nation that does not submit to the king of Babylonia.
Jeremiah,27,14,Do not listen to the prophets who tell you not to surrender to him. They are deceiving you.
Jeremiah,27,15,"The LORD himself has said that he did not send them and that they are lying to you in his name. And so he will drive you out, and you will be killed, you and the prophets who are telling you these lies.”"
Jeremiah,27,16,Then I told the priests and the people that the LORD had said: “Do not listen to the prophets who say that the temple treasures will soon be brought back from Babylonia. They are lying to you.
Jeremiah,27,17,Don't listen to them! Submit to the king of Babylonia and you will live! Why should this city become a pile of ruins?
Jeremiah,27,18,"If they are really prophets and if they have my message, let them ask me, the LORD Almighty, not to allow the treasures that remain in the Temple and in the royal palace to be taken to Babylonia.”"
Jeremiah,28,1," That same year, in the fifth month of the fourth year that Zedekiah was king, Hananiah son of Azzur, a prophet from the town of Gibeon, spoke to me in the Temple. In the presence of the priests and of the people he told me"
Jeremiah,28,2,"that the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, had said: “I have broken the power of the king of Babylonia."
Jeremiah,28,3,Within two years I will bring back to this place all the temple treasures that King Nebuchadnezzar took to Babylonia.
Jeremiah,28,4,"I will also bring back the king of Judah, Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim, along with all the people of Judah who went into exile in Babylonia. Yes, I will break the power of the king of Babylonia. I, the LORD , have spoken.”"
Jeremiah,28,5,"Then in the presence of the priests and of all the people who were standing in the Temple, I said to Hananiah:"
Jeremiah,28,6,“Wonderful! I hope the LORD will do this! I certainly hope he will make your prophecy come true and will bring back from Babylonia all the temple treasures and all the people who were taken away as prisoners.
Jeremiah,28,7,But listen to what I say to you and to the people.
Jeremiah,28,8,"The prophets who spoke long ago, before my time and yours, predicted that war, starvation, and disease would come to many nations and powerful kingdoms."
Jeremiah,28,9,But a prophet who predicts peace can only be recognized as a prophet whom the LORD has truly sent when that prophet's predictions come true.”
Jeremiah,28,10,"Then Hananiah took the yoke off my neck, broke it in pieces,"
Jeremiah,28,11,and said in the presence of all the people: “The LORD has said that this is how he will break the yoke that King Nebuchadnezzar has put on the neck of all the nations; and he will do this within two years.” Then I left.
Jeremiah,28,12,Some time after this the LORD told me
Jeremiah,28,13,"to go and say to Hananiah: “The LORD has said that you may be able to break a wooden yoke, but he will replace it with an iron yoke."
Jeremiah,28,14,"The LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, has said that he will put an iron yoke on all these nations and that they will serve King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia. The LORD has said that he will make even the wild animals serve Nebuchadnezzar.”"
Jeremiah,28,15,"Then I told Hananiah this, and added, “Listen, Hananiah! The LORD did not send you, and you are making these people believe a lie."
Jeremiah,28,16,And so the LORD himself says that he is going to get rid of you. Before this year is over you will die because you have told the people to rebel against the LORD .”
Jeremiah,28,17,And Hananiah died in the seventh month of that same year.
Jeremiah,29,1," I wrote a letter to the priests, the prophets, the leaders of the people, and to all the others whom Nebuchadnezzar had taken away as prisoners from Jerusalem to Babylonia."
Jeremiah,29,2,"I wrote it after King Jehoiachin, his mother, the palace officials, the leaders of Judah and of Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the skilled workmen had been taken into exile."
Jeremiah,29,3,"I gave the letter to Elasah son of Shaphan and to Gemariah son of Hilkiah, whom King Zedekiah of Judah was sending to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia. It said:"
Jeremiah,29,4,"“The LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says to all those people whom he allowed Nebuchadnezzar to take away as prisoners from Jerusalem to Babylonia:"
Jeremiah,29,5,‘Build houses and settle down. Plant gardens and eat what you grow in them.
Jeremiah,29,6,"Marry and have children. Then let your children get married, so that they also may have children. You must increase in numbers and not decrease."
Jeremiah,29,7,"Work for the good of the cities where I have made you go as prisoners. Pray to me on their behalf, because if they are prosperous, you will be prosperous too."
Jeremiah,29,8,"I, the LORD , the God of Israel, warn you not to let yourselves be deceived by the prophets who live among you or by any others who claim they can predict the future. Do not pay any attention to their dreams."
Jeremiah,29,9,"They are telling you lies in my name. I did not send them. I, the LORD Almighty, have spoken.’"
Jeremiah,29,10," “The LORD says, ‘When Babylonia's seventy years are over, I will show my concern for you and keep my promise to bring you back home."
Jeremiah,29,11,"I alone know the plans I have for you, plans to bring you prosperity and not disaster, plans to bring about the future you hope for."
Jeremiah,29,12,"Then you will call to me. You will come and pray to me, and I will answer you."
Jeremiah,29,13,"You will seek me, and you will find me because you will seek me with all your heart."
Jeremiah,29,14,"Yes, I say, you will find me, and I will restore you to your land. I will gather you from every country and from every place to which I have scattered you, and I will bring you back to the land from which I had sent you away into exile. I, the LORD , have spoken.’"
Jeremiah,29,15,“You say that the LORD has given you prophets in Babylonia.
Jeremiah,29,16,"Listen to what the LORD says about the king who rules the kingdom that David ruled and about the people of this city, that is, your relatives who were not taken away as prisoners with you."
Jeremiah,29,17,"The LORD Almighty says, ‘I am bringing war, starvation, and disease on them, and I will make them like figs that are too rotten to be eaten."
Jeremiah,29,18,"I will pursue them with war, starvation, and disease, and all the nations of the world will be horrified at what they see. Everywhere I scatter them, people will be shocked and terrified at what has happened to them. People will mock them and use their name as a curse."
Jeremiah,29,19,This will happen to them because they did not obey the message that I kept on sending to them through my servants the prophets. They refused to listen.
Jeremiah,29,20,"All of you whom I sent into exile in Babylonia, listen to what I, the LORD , say.’"
Jeremiah,29,21,"“The LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, has spoken about Ahab son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah son of Maaseiah, who are telling you lies in his name. He has said that he will hand them over to the power of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia, who will put them to death before your eyes."
Jeremiah,29,22,"When the people who were taken away as prisoners from Jerusalem to Babylonia want to bring a curse on someone, they will say, ‘May the LORD treat you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylonia roasted alive!’"
Jeremiah,29,23,"This will be their fate because they are guilty of terrible sins — they have committed adultery and have told lies in the LORD 's name. This was against the LORD 's will; he knows what they have done, and he is a witness against them. The LORD has spoken.”"
Jeremiah,30,1,"The LORD , the God of Israel,"
Jeremiah,30,2,"said to me: “Write down in a book everything that I have told you,"
Jeremiah,30,3,"because the time is coming when I will restore my people, Israel and Judah. I will bring them back to the land that I gave their ancestors, and they will take possession of it again. I, the LORD , have spoken.”"
Jeremiah,30,4,The LORD says to the people of Israel and Judah:
Jeremiah,30,5,"“I heard a cry of terror, a cry of fear and not of peace."
Jeremiah,30,6,Now stop and think! Can a man give birth to a child? Why then do I see every man with his hands on his stomach like a woman in labour? Why is everyone so pale?
Jeremiah,30,7,"A terrible day is coming; no other day can compare with it — a time of distress for my people, but they will survive.”"
Jeremiah,30,8,"The LORD Almighty says: “When that day comes, I will break the yoke that is round their necks and remove their chains, and they will no longer be the slaves of foreigners."
Jeremiah,30,9,"Instead, they will serve me, the LORD their God, and a descendant of David, whom I will enthrone as king."
Jeremiah,30,10," “My people, do not be afraid; people of Israel, do not be terrified. I will rescue you from that distant land, from the land where you are prisoners. You will come back home and live in peace; you will be secure, and no one will make you afraid."
Jeremiah,30,11,"I will come to you and save you. I will destroy all the nations where I have scattered you, but I will not destroy you. I will not let you go unpunished; but when I punish you, I will be fair. I, the LORD , have spoken.”"
Jeremiah,30,12,"The LORD says to his people, “Your wounds are incurable, your injuries cannot be healed."
Jeremiah,30,13,"There is no one to take care of you, no remedy for your sores, no hope of healing for you."
Jeremiah,30,14,All your lovers have forgotten you; they no longer care about you. I have attacked you like an enemy; your punishment has been harsh because your sins are many and your wickedness is great.
Jeremiah,30,15,Complain no more about your injuries; there is no cure for you. I punished you like this because your sins are many and your wickedness is great.
Jeremiah,30,16,"But now, all who devour you will be devoured, and all your enemies will be taken away as prisoners. All who oppress you will be oppressed, and all who plunder you will be plundered."
Jeremiah,30,17,"I will make you well again; I will heal your wounds, though your enemies say, ‘Zion is an outcast; no one cares about her.’ I, the LORD , have spoken.”"
Jeremiah,30,18,"The LORD says, “I will restore my people to their land and have mercy on every family; Jerusalem will be rebuilt, and its palace restored."
Jeremiah,30,19,The people who live there will sing praise; they will shout for joy. By my blessing they will increase in numbers; my blessing will bring them honour.
Jeremiah,30,20,I will restore the nation's ancient power and establish it firmly again; I will punish all who oppress them.
Jeremiah,31,1,"The LORD says, “The time is coming when I will be the God of all the tribes of Israel, and they will be my people."
Jeremiah,31,2,"In the desert I showed mercy to those people who had escaped death. When the people of Israel longed for rest,"
Jeremiah,31,3,"I appeared to them from far away. People of Israel, I have always loved you, so I continue to show you my constant love."
Jeremiah,31,4,Once again I will rebuild you. Once again you will take up your tambourines and dance joyfully.
Jeremiah,31,5,"Once again you will plant vineyards on the hills of Samaria, and those who plant them will eat what the vineyards produce."
Jeremiah,31,6,"Yes, the time is coming when watchmen will call out on the hills of Ephraim, ‘Let's go up to Zion, to the LORD our God.’ ”"
Jeremiah,31,7,"The LORD says, “Sing with joy for Israel, the greatest of the nations. Sing your song of praise, ‘The LORD has saved his people; he has rescued all who are left.’"
Jeremiah,31,8,"I will bring them from the north and gather them from the ends of the earth. The blind and the lame will come with them, pregnant women and those about to give birth. They will come back a great nation."
Jeremiah,31,9,"My people will return weeping, praying as I lead them back. I will guide them to streams of water, on a smooth road where they will not stumble. I am like a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my eldest son.”"
Jeremiah,31,10,"The LORD says, “Nations, listen to me, and proclaim my words on the far-off shores. I scattered my people, but I will gather them and guard them as a shepherd guards his flock."
Jeremiah,31,11,I have set Israel's people free and have saved them from a mighty nation.
Jeremiah,31,12,"They will come and sing for joy on Mount Zion and be delighted with my gifts — gifts of corn and wine and olive oil, gifts of sheep and cattle. They will be like a well-watered garden; they will have everything they need."
Jeremiah,31,13,"Then the young women will dance and be happy, and men, young and old, will rejoice. I will comfort them and turn their mourning into joy, their sorrow into gladness."
Jeremiah,31,14,"I will fill the priests with the richest food and satisfy all the needs of my people. I, the LORD , have spoken.”"
Jeremiah,31,15," The LORD says, “A sound is heard in Ramah, the sound of bitter weeping. Rachel is crying for her children; they are gone, and she refuses to be comforted."
Jeremiah,31,16,Stop your crying and wipe away your tears. All that you have done for your children will not go unrewarded; they will return from the enemy's land.
Jeremiah,31,17,"There is hope for your future; your children will come back home. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Jeremiah,31,18,"“I hear the people of Israel say in grief, ‘ LORD , we were like an untamed animal, but you taught us to obey. Bring us back; we are ready to return to you, the LORD our God."
Jeremiah,31,19,"We turned away from you, but soon we wanted to return. After you had punished us, we hung our heads in grief. We were ashamed and disgraced, because we sinned when we were young.’"
Jeremiah,31,20,"“Israel, you are my dearest son, the child I love best. Whenever I mention your name, I think of you with love. My heart goes out to you; I will be merciful."
Jeremiah,31,21,"Set up signs and mark the road; find again the way by which you left. Come back, people of Israel, come home to the towns you left."
Jeremiah,31,22,"How long will you hesitate, faithless people? I have created something new and different, as different as a woman protecting a man.”"
Jeremiah,31,23,"The LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says, “When I restore the people to their land, they will once again say in the land of Judah and in its towns, ‘May the LORD bless the sacred hill of Jerusalem, the holy place where he lives.’"
Jeremiah,31,24,"People will live in Judah and in all its towns, and there will be farmers, and shepherds with their flocks."
Jeremiah,31,25,I will refresh those who are weary and will satisfy with food everyone who is weak from hunger.
Jeremiah,31,26,"So then, people will say, ‘I went to sleep and woke up refreshed.’"
Jeremiah,31,27,"“I, the LORD , say that the time is coming when I will fill the land of Israel and Judah with people and animals."
Jeremiah,31,28,"And just as I took care to uproot, to pull down, to overthrow, to destroy, and to demolish them, so I will take care to plant them and to build them up."
Jeremiah,31,29,"When that time comes, people will no longer say, ‘The parents ate the sour grapes, But the children got the sour taste.’"
Jeremiah,31,30,"Instead, all those who eat sour grapes will have their own teeth set on edge; and they will all die because of their own sin.”"
Jeremiah,31,31," The LORD says, “The time is coming when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah."
Jeremiah,31,32,"It will not be like the old covenant that I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand and led them out of Egypt. Although I was like a husband to them, they did not keep that covenant."
Jeremiah,31,33,"The new covenant that I will make with the people of Israel will be this: I will put my law within them and write it on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people."
Jeremiah,31,34,"None of them will have to teach his fellow-citizen to know the LORD , because all will know me, from the least to the greatest. I will forgive their sins and I will no longer remember their wrongs. I, the LORD , have spoken.”"
Jeremiah,31,35,"The LORD provides the sun for light by day, the moon and the stars to shine at night. He stirs up the sea and makes it roar; his name is the LORD Almighty."
Jeremiah,31,36,"He promises that as long as the natural order lasts, so long will Israel be a nation."
Jeremiah,31,37,"If one day the sky could be measured and the foundations of the earth explored, only then would he reject the people of Israel because of all they have done. The LORD has spoken."
Jeremiah,31,38,"“The time is coming,” says the LORD , “when all Jerusalem will be rebuilt as my city, from Hananel Tower west to the Corner Gate."
Jeremiah,31,39,And the boundary line will continue from there on the west to the hill of Gareb and then round to Goah.
Jeremiah,31,40,"The entire valley, where the dead are buried and refuse is thrown, and all the fields above the brook of Kidron as far as the Horse Gate to the east, will be sacred to me. The city will never again be torn down or destroyed.”"
Jeremiah,32,1," The LORD spoke to me in the tenth year that Zedekiah was king of Judah, which was also the eighteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia."
Jeremiah,32,2,"At that time the army of the king of Babylonia was attacking Jerusalem, and I was locked up in the courtyard of the royal palace."
Jeremiah,32,3,"King Zedekiah had imprisoned me there and had accused me of announcing that the LORD had said, “I am going to let the king of Babylonia capture this city,"
Jeremiah,32,4,and King Zedekiah will not escape. He will be handed over to the king of Babylonia; he will see him face to face and will speak to him in person.
Jeremiah,32,5,"Zedekiah will be taken to Babylonia, and he will remain there until I deal with him. Even if he fights the Babylonians, he will not be successful. I, the LORD , have spoken.”"
Jeremiah,32,6,The LORD told me
Jeremiah,32,7,"that Hanamel, my uncle Shallum's son, would come to me with the request to buy his field at Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin, because I was his nearest relative and had the right to buy it for myself."
Jeremiah,32,8,"Then, just as the LORD had said, Hanamel came to me there in the courtyard and asked me to buy the field. So I knew that the LORD had really spoken to me."
Jeremiah,32,9,I bought the field from Hanamel and weighed out the money to him; the price came to seventeen pieces of silver.
Jeremiah,32,10,"I signed and sealed the deed, had it witnessed, and weighed out the money on scales."
Jeremiah,32,11,"Then I took both copies of the deed of purchase — the sealed copy containing the contract and its conditions, and the open copy —"
Jeremiah,32,12,"and gave them to Baruch, the son of Neriah and grandson of Mahseiah. I gave them to him in the presence of Hanamel and of the witnesses who had signed the deed of purchase and of the people who were sitting in the courtyard."
Jeremiah,32,13,"Before them all I said to Baruch,"
Jeremiah,32,14,"“The LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, has ordered you to take these deeds, both the sealed deed of purchase and the open copy, and to place them in a clay jar, so that they may be preserved for years to come."
Jeremiah,32,15,"The LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, has said that houses, fields, and vineyards will again be bought in this land.”"
Jeremiah,32,16,"After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch, I prayed,"
Jeremiah,32,17,"“Sovereign LORD , you made the earth and the sky by your great power and might; nothing is too difficult for you."
Jeremiah,32,18,"You have shown constant love to thousands, but you also punish people for the sins of their parents. You are a great and powerful God; you are the LORD Almighty."
Jeremiah,32,19,"You make wise plans and do mighty things; you see everything that people do, and you reward them according to their actions."
Jeremiah,32,20,"Long ago, you performed miracles and wonders in Egypt, and you have continued to perform them to this day, both in Israel and among all the other nations, so that you are now known everywhere."
Jeremiah,32,21,"By means of miracles and wonders that terrified our enemies, you used your power and might to bring your people Israel out of Egypt."
Jeremiah,32,22,"You gave them this rich and fertile land, as you had promised their ancestors."
Jeremiah,32,23,"But when they came into this land and took possession of it, they did not obey your commands or live according to your teaching; they did nothing that you had ordered them to do. And so you brought all this destruction on them."
Jeremiah,32,24,"“The Babylonians have built siege mounds round the city to capture it, and they are attacking. War, starvation, and disease will make the city fall into their hands. You can see that all you have said has come true."
Jeremiah,32,25,"Yet, Sovereign LORD , you are the one who ordered me to buy the field in the presence of witnesses, even though the city is about to be captured by the Babylonians.”"
Jeremiah,32,26,"Then the LORD said to me,"
Jeremiah,32,27,"“I am the LORD , the God of the whole human race. Nothing is too difficult for me."
Jeremiah,32,28,I am going to give this city over to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia and his army; they will capture it
Jeremiah,32,29,"and set it on fire. They will burn it down, together with the houses where people have made me angry by burning incense to Baal on the rooftops and by pouring out wine offerings to other gods."
Jeremiah,32,30,From the very beginning of their history the people of Israel and the people of Judah have displeased me and made me angry by what they have done.
Jeremiah,32,31,The people of this city have made me angry and furious from the day it was built. I have decided to destroy it
Jeremiah,32,32,"because of all the evil that has been done by the people of Judah and Jerusalem, together with their kings and leaders, their priests and prophets."
Jeremiah,32,33,"They turned their backs on me; and though I kept on teaching them, they would not listen and learn."
Jeremiah,32,34,"They even placed their disgusting idols in the Temple built for my worship, and they have defiled it."
Jeremiah,32,35,"They have built altars to Baal in the Valley of Hinnom, to sacrifice their sons and daughters to the god Molech. I did not command them to do this, and it did not even enter my mind that they would do such a thing and make the people of Judah sin.”"
Jeremiah,32,36,"The LORD , the God of Israel, said to me, “Jeremiah, the people are saying that war, starvation, and disease will make this city fall into the hands of the king of Babylonia. Now listen to what else I have to say."
Jeremiah,32,37,"I am going to gather the people from all the countries where I have scattered them in my anger and fury, and I am going to bring them back to this place and let them live here in safety."
Jeremiah,32,38,"Then they will be my people, and I will be their God."
Jeremiah,32,39,"I will give them a single purpose in life: to honour me for all time, for their own good and the good of their descendants."
Jeremiah,32,40,"I will make an eternal covenant with them. I will never stop doing good things for them, and I will make them fear me with all their heart, so that they will never turn away from me."
Jeremiah,32,41,"I will take pleasure in doing good things for them, and I will establish them permanently in this land."
Jeremiah,32,42,"“Just as I have brought this disaster on these people, so I am going to give them all the good things that I have promised."
Jeremiah,32,43,"The people are saying that this land will be like a desert where neither people nor animals live, and that it will be given over to the Babylonians. But fields will once again be bought in this land."
Jeremiah,32,44,"People will buy them, and the deeds will be signed, sealed, and witnessed. This will take place in the territory of Benjamin, in the villages round Jerusalem, in the towns of Judah, and in the towns in the hill country, in the foothills, and in southern Judah. I will restore the people to their land. I, the LORD , have spoken.”"
Jeremiah,33,1,"While I was still in prison in the courtyard, the LORD 's message came to me again."
Jeremiah,33,2,"The LORD , who made the earth, who formed it and set it in place, spoke to me. He whose name is the LORD said,"
Jeremiah,33,3,"“Call to me, and I will answer you; I will tell you wonderful and marvellous things that you know nothing about."
Jeremiah,33,4,"I, the LORD , the God of Israel, say that the houses of Jerusalem and the royal palace of Judah will be torn down as a result of the siege and the attack."
Jeremiah,33,5,"Some will fight against the Babylonians, who will fill the houses with the corpses of those whom I am going to strike down in my anger and fury. I have turned away from this city because of the evil things that its people have done."
Jeremiah,33,6,But I will heal this city and its people and restore them to health. I will show them abundant peace and security.
Jeremiah,33,7,"I will make Judah and Israel prosperous, and I will rebuild them as they were before."
Jeremiah,33,8,"I will purify them from the sins that they have committed against me, and I will forgive their sins and their rebellion."
Jeremiah,33,9,"Jerusalem will be a source of joy, honour, and pride to me; and every nation in the world will fear and tremble when they hear about the good things that I do for the people of Jerusalem and about the prosperity that I bring to the city.”"
Jeremiah,33,10,"The LORD said, “People are saying that this place is like a desert, that it has no people or animals living in it. And they are right; the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem are empty; no people or animals live there. But in these places you will hear again"
Jeremiah,33,11,"the shouts of gladness and joy and the happy sounds of wedding feasts. You will hear people sing as they bring thank-offerings to my Temple; they will say, ‘Give thanks to the LORD Almighty, because he is good and his love is eternal.’ I will make this land as prosperous as it was before. I, the LORD , have spoken.”"
Jeremiah,33,12,"The LORD Almighty said, “In this land that is like a desert and where no people or animals live, there will once again be pastures where shepherds can take their sheep."
Jeremiah,33,13,"In the towns of the hill country, in the foothills, and in southern Judah, in the territory of Benjamin, in the villages round Jerusalem, and in the towns of Judah, shepherds will once again count their sheep. I, the LORD , have spoken.”"
Jeremiah,33,14," The LORD said, “The time is coming when I will fulfil the promise that I made to the people of Israel and Judah."
Jeremiah,33,15,At that time I will choose as king a righteous descendant of David. That king will do what is right and just throughout the land.
Jeremiah,33,16,The people of Judah and of Jerusalem will be rescued and will live in safety. The city will be called ‘The LORD Our Salvation’.
Jeremiah,33,17,"I, the LORD , promise that there will always be a descendant of David to be king of Israel"
Jeremiah,33,18,"and that there will always be priests from the tribe of Levi to serve me and to offer burnt offerings, grain offerings, and sacrifices.”"
Jeremiah,33,19,"The LORD said to me,"
Jeremiah,33,20,"“I have made a covenant with the day and with the night, so that they always come at their proper times; and that covenant can never be broken."
Jeremiah,33,21,"In the same way I have made a covenant with my servant David that he would always have a descendant to be king, and I have made a covenant with the priests from the tribe of Levi that they would always serve me; and those covenants can never be broken."
Jeremiah,33,22,"I will increase the number of descendants of my servant David and the number of priests from the tribe of Levi, so that it will be as impossible to count them as it is to count the stars in the sky or the grains of sand on the seashore.”"
Jeremiah,33,23,"The LORD said to me,"
Jeremiah,33,24,"“Have you noticed how people are saying that I have rejected Israel and Judah, the two families that I chose? And so they look with contempt on my people and no longer consider them a nation."
Jeremiah,33,25,"But I, the LORD , have a covenant with day and night, and I have made the laws that control earth and sky."
Jeremiah,33,26,"And just as surely as I have done this, so I will maintain my covenant with Jacob's descendants and with my servant David. I will choose one of David's descendants to rule over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I will be merciful to my people and make them prosperous again.”"
Jeremiah,34,1," The LORD spoke to me when King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia and his army, supported by troops from all the nations and races that were subject to him, were attacking Jerusalem and its nearby towns."
Jeremiah,34,2,"The LORD , the God of Israel, told me to go and say to King Zedekiah of Judah, “I, the LORD , will hand this city over to the king of Babylonia, and he will burn it down."
Jeremiah,34,3,You will not escape; you will be captured and handed over to him. You will see him face to face and talk to him in person; then you will go to Babylonia.
Jeremiah,34,4,"Zedekiah, listen to what I say about you. You will not be killed in battle."
Jeremiah,34,5,"You will die in peace, and as people burnt incense when they buried your ancestors, who were kings before you, in the same way they will burn incense for you. They will mourn over you and say, ‘Our king is dead!’ I, the LORD , have spoken.”"
Jeremiah,34,6,Then I gave this message to King Zedekiah in Jerusalem
Jeremiah,34,7,"while the army of the king of Babylonia was attacking the city. The army was also attacking Lachish and Azekah, the only other fortified cities left in Judah."
Jeremiah,34,8,King Zedekiah and the people of Jerusalem had made an agreement to set free
Jeremiah,34,9,"their Hebrew slaves, both male and female, so that no one would have a fellow-Israelite as a slave."
Jeremiah,34,10,"All the people and their leaders agreed to free their slaves and never to enslave them again. They did set them free,"
Jeremiah,34,11,"but later they changed their minds, took them back, and forced them to become slaves again."
Jeremiah,34,12,"Then the LORD,"
Jeremiah,34,13,"the God of Israel, told me to say to the people: “I made a covenant with your ancestors when I rescued them from Egypt and set them free from slavery. I told them that"
Jeremiah,34,14,every seven years they were to set free any Hebrew slave who had served them for six years. But your ancestors would not pay any attention to me or listen to what I said.
Jeremiah,34,15,"Just a few days ago you changed your minds and did what pleased me. All of you agreed to set your fellow-Israelites free, and you made a covenant in my presence, in the Temple where I am worshipped."
Jeremiah,34,16,"But then you changed your minds again and dishonoured me. All of you took back the slaves whom you had set free as they desired, and you forced them into slavery again."
Jeremiah,34,17,"So now, I, the LORD , say that you have disobeyed me: you have not given your fellow-Israelites their freedom. Very well, then, I will give you freedom: the freedom to die by war, disease, and starvation. I will make every nation in the world horrified at what I do to you."
Jeremiah,35,1," When Jehoiakim son of Josiah was king of Judah, the LORD said to me,"
Jeremiah,35,2,“Go to the members of the Rechabite clan and talk to them. Then bring them into one of the rooms in the Temple and offer them some wine.”
Jeremiah,35,3,"So I took the entire Rechabite clan — Jaazaniah (the son of another Jeremiah, who was Habazziniah's son) and all his brothers and sons —"
Jeremiah,35,4,"and brought them to the Temple. I took them into the room of the disciples of the prophet Hanan son of Igdaliah. This room was above the room of Maaseiah son of Shallum, an important official in the Temple, and near the rooms of the other officials."
Jeremiah,35,5,"Then I placed cups and bowls full of wine before the Rechabites, and I said to them, “Have some wine.”"
Jeremiah,35,6,"But they answered, “We do not drink wine. Our ancestor Jonadab son of Rechab told us that neither we nor our descendants were ever to drink any wine."
Jeremiah,35,7,"He also told us not to build houses or farm the land, and not to plant vineyards or buy them. He commanded us always to live in tents, so that we might remain in this land where we live like strangers."
Jeremiah,35,8,"We have obeyed all the instructions that Jonadab gave us. We ourselves never drink wine, and neither do our wives, our sons, or our daughters."
Jeremiah,36,1," In the fourth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was king of Judah, the LORD said to me,"
Jeremiah,36,2,"“Get a scroll and write on it everything that I have told you about Israel and Judah and all the nations. Write everything that I have told you from the time I first spoke to you, when Josiah was king, up to the present."
Jeremiah,36,3,"Perhaps when the people of Judah hear about all the destruction that I intend to bring on them, they will turn from their evil ways. Then I will forgive their wickedness and their sins.”"
Jeremiah,36,4,So I called Baruch son of Neriah and dictated to him everything that the LORD had said to me. And Baruch wrote it all down on a scroll.
Jeremiah,36,5,Then I gave Baruch the following instructions: “I am no longer allowed to go into the Temple.
Jeremiah,36,6,"But I want you to go there the next time the people are fasting. You are to read the scroll aloud, so that they will hear everything that the LORD has said to me and that I have dictated to you. Do this where everyone can hear you, including the people of Judah who have come in from their towns."
Jeremiah,36,7,"Perhaps they will pray to the LORD and turn from their evil ways, because the LORD has threatened this people with his terrible anger and fury.”"
Jeremiah,36,8,So Baruch read the LORD 's words in the Temple exactly as I had told him to do.
Jeremiah,36,9,"In the ninth month of the fifth year that Jehoiakim was king of Judah, the people fasted to gain the LORD 's favour. The fast was kept by all who lived in Jerusalem and by all who came there from the towns of Judah."
Jeremiah,36,10,"Then, while all the people were listening, Baruch read from the scroll everything that I had said. He did this in the Temple, from the room of Gemariah son of Shaphan, the court secretary. His room was in the upper court near the entrance of the New Gate of the Temple."
Jeremiah,36,11,"Micaiah, the son of Gemariah and grandson of Shaphan, heard Baruch read from the scroll what the LORD had said."
Jeremiah,36,12,"Then he went to the royal palace, to the room of the court secretary, where all the officials were in session. Elishama, the court secretary, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Achbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the other officials were there."
Jeremiah,36,13,Micaiah told them everything that he had heard Baruch read to the people.
Jeremiah,36,14,"Then the officials sent Jehudi (the son of Nethaniah, grandson of Shelemiah, and great-grandson of Cushi) to tell Baruch to bring the scroll that he had read to the people. Baruch brought them the scroll."
Jeremiah,36,15,"“Sit down,” they said, “and read the scroll to us.” So Baruch did."
Jeremiah,36,16,"After he had read it, they turned to one another in alarm, and said to Baruch, “We must report this to the king.”"
Jeremiah,36,17,"Then they asked him, “Tell us, now, how did you come to write all this? Did Jeremiah dictate it to you?”"
Jeremiah,36,18,"Baruch answered, “Jeremiah dictated every word of it to me, and I wrote it down in ink on this scroll.”"
Jeremiah,36,19,"Then they said to him, “You and Jeremiah must go and hide. Don't let anyone know where you are.”"
Jeremiah,36,20,"The officials put the scroll in the room of Elishama, the court secretary, and went to the king's court, where they reported everything to the king."
Jeremiah,36,21,Then the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll. He took it from the room of Elishama and read it to the king and all the officials who were standing round him.
Jeremiah,36,22,It was winter and the king was sitting in his winter palace in front of the fire.
Jeremiah,36,23,"As soon as Jehudi finished reading three or four columns, the king cut them off with a small knife and threw them into the fire. He kept doing this until the entire scroll was burnt up."
Jeremiah,36,24,But neither the king nor any of his officials who heard all this was afraid or showed any sign of sorrow.
Jeremiah,36,25,"Although Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah begged the king not to burn the scroll, he paid no attention to them."
Jeremiah,36,26,"Then he ordered Prince Jerahmeel, together with Seraiah son of Azriel and Shelemiah son of Abdeel, to arrest me and my secretary Baruch. But the LORD had hidden us."
Jeremiah,36,27,"After King Jehoiakim had burnt the scroll that I had dictated to Baruch, the LORD told me"
Jeremiah,36,28,to take another scroll and write on it everything that had been on the first one.
Jeremiah,36,29,"The LORD told me to say to the king, “You have burnt the scroll, and you have asked Jeremiah why he wrote that the king of Babylonia would come and destroy this land and kill its people and its animals."
Jeremiah,36,30,"So now, I, the LORD , say to you, King Jehoiakim, that no descendant of yours will ever rule over David's kingdom. Your corpse will be thrown out where it will be exposed to the sun during the day and to the frost at night."
Jeremiah,36,31,"I will punish you, your descendants, and your officials because of the sins all of you commit. Neither you nor the people of Jerusalem and of Judah have paid any attention to my warnings, and so I will bring on all of you the disaster that I have threatened.”"
Jeremiah,36,32,"Then I took another scroll and gave it to my secretary Baruch, and he wrote down everything that I dictated. He wrote everything that had been on the first scroll and similar messages that I dictated to him."
Jeremiah,37,1, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia made Zedekiah son of Josiah king of Judah in the place of Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim.
Jeremiah,37,2,But neither Zedekiah nor his officials nor the people obeyed the message which the LORD had given me.
Jeremiah,37,3,King Zedekiah sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah to ask me to pray to the LORD our God on behalf of our nation.
Jeremiah,37,4,I had not yet been put in prison and was still moving about freely among the people.
Jeremiah,37,5,"The Babylonian army had been besieging Jerusalem, but when they heard that the Egyptian army had crossed the Egyptian border, they retreated."
Jeremiah,37,6,"Then the LORD , the God of Israel, told me"
Jeremiah,37,7,"to say to Zedekiah, “The Egyptian army is on its way to help you, but it will return home."
Jeremiah,37,8,"Then the Babylonians will come back, attack the city, capture it, and burn it down."
Jeremiah,37,9,"I, the LORD , warn you not to deceive yourselves into thinking that the Babylonians will not come back, because they will."
Jeremiah,37,10,"Even if you defeat the whole Babylonian army, so that only wounded men are left, lying in their tents, those men would still get up and burn this city to the ground.”"
Jeremiah,37,11,The Babylonian army retreated from Jerusalem because the Egyptian army was approaching.
Jeremiah,37,12,So I started to leave Jerusalem and go to the territory of Benjamin to take possession of my share of the family property.
Jeremiah,37,13,"But when I reached the Benjamin Gate, the officer in charge of the soldiers on duty there, a man by the name of Irijah, the son of Shelemiah and grandson of Hananiah, stopped me and said, “You are deserting to the Babylonians!”"
Jeremiah,37,14,"I answered, “That's not so! I'm not deserting.” But Irijah would not listen to me. Instead, he arrested me and took me to the officials."
Jeremiah,37,15,"They were furious with me and ordered me to be beaten and locked up in the house of Jonathan, the court secretary, whose house had been made into a prison."
Jeremiah,37,16,I was put in an underground cell and kept there a long time.
Jeremiah,37,17,"Later on King Zedekiah sent for me, and there in the palace he asked me privately, “Is there any message from the LORD ?” “There is,” I answered, and added, “You will be handed over to the king of Babylonia.”"
Jeremiah,37,18,"Then I asked, “What crime have I committed against you or your officials or this people, to make you put me in prison?"
Jeremiah,37,19,What happened to your prophets who told you that the king of Babylonia would not attack you or the country?
Jeremiah,37,20,"And now, Your Majesty, I beg you to listen to me and do what I ask. Please do not send me back to the prison in Jonathan's house. If you do, I will surely die there.”"
Jeremiah,37,21,"So King Zedekiah ordered me to be locked up in the palace courtyard. I stayed there, and each day I was given a loaf of bread from the bakeries until all the bread in the city was gone."
Jeremiah,38,1,"Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jehucal son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur son of Malchiah heard that I was telling the people that"
Jeremiah,38,2,"the LORD had said, “Whoever stays on in the city will die in war or of starvation or disease. But those who go out and surrender to the Babylonians will not be killed; they will at least escape with their lives.”"
Jeremiah,38,3,"I was also telling them that the LORD had said, “I am going to give the city to the Babylonian army, and they will capture it.”"
Jeremiah,38,4,"Then the officials went to the king and said, “This man must be put to death. By talking like this he is making the soldiers in the city lose their courage, and he is doing the same thing to everyone else left in the city. He is not trying to help the people; he only wants to hurt them.”"
Jeremiah,38,5,"King Zedekiah answered, “Very well, then, do what you wish with him; I can't stop you.”"
Jeremiah,38,6,"So they took me and let me down by ropes into Prince Malchiah's well, which was in the palace courtyard. There was no water in the well, only mud, and I sank down in it."
Jeremiah,38,7,"However, Ebedmelech the Ethiopian , a eunuch who worked in the royal palace, heard that they had put me in the well. At that time the king was holding court at the Benjamin Gate."
Jeremiah,38,8,"So Ebedmelech went there and said to the king,"
Jeremiah,38,9,"“Your Majesty, what these men have done is wrong. They have put Jeremiah in the well, where he is sure to die of starvation, since there is no more food in the city.”"
Jeremiah,38,10,Then the king ordered Ebedmelech to take with him three men and to pull me out of the well before I died.
Jeremiah,38,11,So Ebedmelech went with the men to the palace storeroom and got some worn-out clothing which he let down to me by ropes.
Jeremiah,38,12,"He told me to put the rags under my arms, so that the ropes wouldn't hurt me. I did this,"
Jeremiah,38,13,and they pulled me up out of the well. After that I was kept in the courtyard.
Jeremiah,38,14,"On another occasion King Zedekiah had me brought to him at the third entrance to the Temple, and he said, “I am going to ask you a question, and I want you to tell me the whole truth.”"
Jeremiah,38,15,"I answered, “If I tell you the truth, you will put me to death, and if I give you advice, you won't pay any attention.”"
Jeremiah,38,16,"So King Zedekiah promised me in secret, “I swear by the living God, the God who gave us life, that I will not put you to death or hand you over to the men who want to kill you.”"
Jeremiah,38,17,"Then I told Zedekiah that the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, had said, “If you surrender to the king of Babylonia's officers, your life will be spared, and this city will not be burnt down. Both you and your family will be spared."
Jeremiah,38,18,"But if you do not surrender, then this city will be handed over to the Babylonians, who will burn it down, and you will not escape from them.”"
Jeremiah,38,19,"But the king answered, “I am afraid of our countrymen who have deserted to the Babylonians. I may be handed over to them and tortured.”"
Jeremiah,38,20,"I said, “You will not be handed over to them. I beg you to obey the LORD 's message; then all will go well with you, and your life will be spared."
Jeremiah,38,21,But the LORD has shown me in a vision what will happen if you refuse to surrender.
Jeremiah,38,22,"In it I saw all the women left in Judah's royal palace being led out to the king of Babylonia's officers. Listen to what they were saying as they went: ‘The king's best friends misled him, they overruled him. And now that his feet have sunk in the mud, his friends have left him.’ ”"
Jeremiah,38,23,"Then I added, “All your women and children will be taken out to the Babylonians, and you yourself will not escape from them. You will be taken prisoner by the king of Babylonia, and this city will be burnt to the ground.”"
Jeremiah,38,24,"Zedekiah replied, “Don't let anyone know about this conversation, and your life will not be in danger."
Jeremiah,38,25,"If the officials hear that I have talked with you, they will come and ask you what we said. They will promise not to put you to death if you tell them everything."
Jeremiah,38,26,Just tell them you were begging me not to send you back to prison to die there.”
Jeremiah,38,27,"Then all the officials came and questioned me, and I told them exactly what the king had told me to say. There was nothing else they could do, because no one had overheard the conversation."
Jeremiah,38,28,And I was kept in the palace courtyard until the day Jerusalem was captured.
Jeremiah,39,1,"In the tenth month of the ninth year that Zedekiah was king of Judah, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia came with his whole army and attacked Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,39,2,"On the ninth day of the fourth month of Zedekiah's eleventh year as king, the city walls were broken through."
Jeremiah,39,3,"(When Jerusalem was captured, all the high officials of the king of Babylonia came and took their places at the Middle Gate, including Nergal Sarezer, Samgar Nebo, Sarsechim, and another Nergal Sarezer.)"
Jeremiah,39,4,"When King Zedekiah and all his soldiers saw what was happening, they tried to escape from the city during the night. They left by way of the royal garden, went through the gateway connecting the two walls, and escaped in the direction of the Jordan Valley."
Jeremiah,39,5,"But the Babylonian army pursued them and captured Zedekiah in the plains near Jericho. Then they took him to King Nebuchadnezzar, who was in the city of Riblah in the territory of Hamath, and there Nebuchadnezzar passed sentence on him."
Jeremiah,39,6,"At Riblah he put Zedekiah's sons to death while Zedekiah was looking on, and he also executed the officials of Judah."
Jeremiah,39,7,"After that, he had Zedekiah's eyes put out and had him placed in chains to be taken to Babylonia."
Jeremiah,39,8,"Meanwhile, the Babylonians burnt down the royal palace and the houses of the people and tore down the walls of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,39,9,"Finally Nebuzaradan, the commanding officer, took away as prisoners to Babylonia the people who were left in the city, together with those who had deserted to him."
Jeremiah,39,10,"He left in the land of Judah some of the poorest people, who owned no property, and he gave them vineyards and fields."
Jeremiah,39,11,"But King Nebuchadnezzar commanded Nebuzaradan, the commanding officer, to give the following order:"
Jeremiah,39,12,"“Go and find Jeremiah and take good care of him. Do not harm him, but do for him whatever he wants.”"
Jeremiah,39,13,"So Nebuzaradan, together with the high officials Nebushazban and Nergal Sarezer and all the other officers of the king of Babylonia,"
Jeremiah,39,14,"brought me from the palace courtyard. They put me under the care of Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, who was to see that I got home safely. And so I stayed there among the people."
Jeremiah,39,15,"While I was still imprisoned in the palace courtyard, the LORD told me"
Jeremiah,39,16,"to tell Ebedmelech the Ethiopian that the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, had said, “Just as I said I would, I am going to bring upon this city destruction and not prosperity. And when this happens, you will be there to see it."
Jeremiah,39,17,"But I, the LORD , will protect you, and you will not be handed over to those you fear."
Jeremiah,39,18,"I will keep you safe, and you will not be put to death. You will escape with your life because you have put your trust in me. I, the LORD , have spoken.”"
Jeremiah,40,1,"The LORD spoke to me after Nebuzaradan, the commanding officer, had set me free at Ramah. I had been taken there in chains, along with all the other people from Jerusalem and Judah who were being taken away as prisoners to Babylonia."
Jeremiah,40,2,"The commanding officer took me aside and said, “The LORD your God threatened this land with destruction,"
Jeremiah,40,3,and now he has done what he said he would. All this happened because your people sinned against the LORD and disobeyed him.
Jeremiah,40,4,"Now, I am taking the chains off your wrists and setting you free. If you want to go to Babylonia with me, you may do so, and I will take care of you. But if you don't want to go, you don't have to. You have the whole country to choose from, and you may go wherever you wish.”"
Jeremiah,40,5,"When I did not answer, Nebuzaradan said, “Go back to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylonia has made governor of the towns of Judah. You may stay with him and live among the people, or you may go anywhere you think you should.” Then he gave me a present and some food to take with me, and let me go on my way."
Jeremiah,40,6,I went to stay with Gedaliah in Mizpah and lived among the people who were left in the land.
Jeremiah,40,7, Some of the Judean officers and soldiers had not surrendered. They heard that the king of Babylonia had made Gedaliah governor of the land and had placed him in charge of all those who had not been taken away to Babylonia — the poorest people in the land.
Jeremiah,40,8,"So Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan son of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai from Netophah, and Jezaniah from Maacah went with their men to Gedaliah at Mizpah."
Jeremiah,40,9,"Gedaliah said to them, “I give you my word that there is no need for you to be afraid to surrender to the Babylonians. Settle down in this land, serve the king of Babylonia, and all will go well with you."
Jeremiah,40,10,"I myself will stay in Mizpah and be your representative when the Babylonians come here. But you can gather and store up wine, fruit, and olive oil, and live in the villages you occupy.”"
Jeremiah,40,11,"Meanwhile, all the Israelites who were in Moab, Ammon, Edom, and other countries, heard that the king of Babylonia had allowed some Israelites to stay on in Judah and that he had made Gedaliah their governor."
Jeremiah,40,12,"So they left the places where they had been scattered, and returned to Judah. They came to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and there they gathered in large amounts of wine and fruit."
Jeremiah,40,13,"After this, Johanan and the leaders of the soldiers who had not surrendered came to Gedaliah at Mizpah"
Jeremiah,40,14,"and said to him, “Don't you know that King Baalis of Ammon has sent Ishmael to murder you?” But Gedaliah did not believe it."
Jeremiah,40,15,"Then Johanan said privately to him, “Let me go and kill Ishmael, and no one will know who did it. Why should he be allowed to murder you? That would cause all the Jews who have gathered round you to be scattered, and it would bring disaster on all the people who are left in Judah.”"
Jeremiah,40,16,"But Gedaliah answered, “Don't do it! What you are saying about Ishmael is not true!”"
Jeremiah,41,1," In the seventh month of that year, Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah and grandson of Elishama, a member of the royal family and one of the king's chief officers, went to Mizpah with ten men to see Gedaliah. While they were all eating a meal together,"
Jeremiah,41,2,Ishmael and the ten men with him pulled out their swords and killed Gedaliah.
Jeremiah,41,3,Ishmael also killed all the Israelites who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah and the Babylonian soldiers who happened to be there.
Jeremiah,41,4,"The next day, before anyone knew about Gedaliah's murder,"
Jeremiah,41,5,"eighty men arrived from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria. They had shaved off their beards, torn their clothes, and gashed themselves. They were taking corn and incense to offer in the Temple."
Jeremiah,41,6,"So Ishmael went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he went. When he came to them, he said, “Please come in to see Gedaliah.”"
Jeremiah,41,7,"As soon as they were inside the city, Ishmael and his men killed them and threw their bodies in a well."
Jeremiah,41,8,"But there were ten men in the group who said to Ishmael, “Please don't kill us! We have wheat, barley, olive oil, and honey hidden in the fields.” So he spared them."
Jeremiah,41,9,The well into which Ishmael threw the bodies of the men he had killed was the large one that King Asa had dug when he was being attacked by King Baasha of Israel. Ishmael filled the well with the bodies.
Jeremiah,41,10,"Then he made prisoners of the king's daughters and all the rest of the people in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the commanding officer had placed under the care of Gedaliah. Ishmael took them prisoner and started off in the direction of the territory of Ammon."
Jeremiah,41,11,Johanan and all the army leaders with him heard of the crime that Ishmael had committed.
Jeremiah,41,12,So they went after him with their men and overtook him near the large pool at Gibeon.
Jeremiah,41,13,"When Ishmael's prisoners saw Johanan and the leaders of the forces with him, they were glad,"
Jeremiah,41,14,and turned and ran to them.
Jeremiah,41,15,But Ishmael and eight of his men got away from Johanan and escaped to the land of Ammon.
Jeremiah,41,16,"Then Johanan and the leaders of the forces with him took charge of the people whom Ishmael had taken away as prisoners from Mizpah after murdering Gedaliah — soldiers, women, children, and eunuchs."
Jeremiah,42,1,"Then all the army leaders, including Johanan son of Kareah and Azariah son of Hoshaiah, came with people of every class"
Jeremiah,42,2,"and said to me, “Please do what we ask you! Pray to the LORD our God for us. Pray for all of us who have survived. Once there were many of us; but now only a few of us are left, as you can see."
Jeremiah,42,3,Pray that the LORD our God will show us the way we should go and what we should do.”
Jeremiah,42,4,"I answered, “Very well, then. I will pray to the LORD our God, just as you have asked, and whatever he says, I will tell you. I will not keep back anything from you.”"
Jeremiah,42,5,"Then they said to me, “May the LORD be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not obey all the commands that the LORD our God gives you for us."
Jeremiah,42,6,"Whether it pleases us or not, we will obey the LORD our God, to whom we are asking you to pray. All will go well with us if we obey him.”"
Jeremiah,42,7,Ten days later the LORD spoke to me;
Jeremiah,42,8,"so I called together Johanan, all the army leaders who were with him, and all the other people."
Jeremiah,42,9,"I said to them, “The LORD , the God of Israel, to whom you sent me with your request has said,"
Jeremiah,42,10,"‘If you are willing to go on living in this land, then I will build you up and not tear you down; I will plant you and not pull you up. The destruction I brought on you has caused me great sorrow."
Jeremiah,42,11,"Stop being afraid of the king of Babylonia. I am with you, and I will rescue you from his power."
Jeremiah,42,12,"Because I am merciful, I will make him have mercy on you and let you go back home. I, the LORD , have spoken.’"
Jeremiah,43,1,I finished telling the people everything that the LORD their God had sent me to tell them.
Jeremiah,43,2,"Then Azariah son of Hoshaiah and Johanan son of Kareah and all the other arrogant men said to me, “You are lying. The LORD our God did not send you to tell us not to go and live in Egypt."
Jeremiah,43,3,"Baruch son of Neriah has stirred you up against us, so that the Babylonians will gain power over us and can either kill us or take us away to Babylonia.”"
Jeremiah,43,4,So neither Johanan nor any of the army officers nor any of the people would obey the LORD 's command to remain in the land of Judah.
Jeremiah,43,5,"Then Johanan and all the army officers took everybody left in Judah away to Egypt, together with all the people who had returned from the nations where they had been scattered:"
Jeremiah,43,6,"the men, the women, the children, and the king's daughters. They took everyone whom Nebuzaradan the commanding officer had left under the care of Gedaliah, including Baruch and me."
Jeremiah,43,7,They disobeyed the LORD 's command and went into Egypt as far as the city of Tahpanhes.
Jeremiah,43,8,"There the LORD said to me,"
Jeremiah,43,9,"“Get some large stones and bury them in the mortar of the pavement in front of the entrance to the government building here in the city, and let some of the Israelites see you do it."
Jeremiah,43,10,"Then tell them that I, the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, am going to bring my servant King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia to this place, and he will put his throne over these stones that you buried, and will spread the royal tent over them."
Jeremiah,43,11,"Nebuchadnezzar will come and defeat Egypt. Those people who are doomed to die of disease will die of disease, those doomed to be taken away as prisoners will be taken away as prisoners, and those doomed to be killed in war will be killed in war."
Jeremiah,43,12,"I will set fire to the temples of Egypt's gods, and the king of Babylonia will either burn their gods or carry them off. As shepherds pick their clothes clean of lice, so the king of Babylonia will pick the land of Egypt clean and then leave victorious."
Jeremiah,43,13,He will destroy the sacred stone monuments at Heliopolis in Egypt and will burn down the temples of the Egyptian gods.”
Jeremiah,44,1,"The LORD spoke to me concerning all the Israelites living in Egypt, in the cities of Migdol, Tahpanhes, and Memphis, and in the southern part of the country."
Jeremiah,44,2,"The LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, said, “You yourselves have seen the destruction I brought on Jerusalem and all the other cities of Judah. Even now they are still in ruins, and no one lives in them"
Jeremiah,44,3,because their people had done evil and had made me angry. They offered sacrifices to other gods and served gods that neither they nor you nor your ancestors ever worshipped.
Jeremiah,44,4,"I kept sending you my servants the prophets, who told you not to do this terrible thing that I hate."
Jeremiah,44,5,But you would not listen or pay any attention. You would not give up your evil practice of sacrificing to other gods.
Jeremiah,44,6,"So I poured out my anger and fury on the towns of Judah and on the streets of Jerusalem, and I set them on fire. They were left in ruins and became a horrifying sight, as they are today."
Jeremiah,44,7,"“And so I, the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, now ask why you are doing such an evil thing to yourselves. Do you want to bring destruction on men and women, children and babies, so that none of your people will be left?"
Jeremiah,44,8,"Why do you make me angry by worshipping idols and by sacrificing to other gods here in Egypt, where you have come to live? Are you doing this just to destroy yourselves, so that every nation on earth will treat you with scorn and use your name as a curse?"
Jeremiah,44,9,"Have you forgotten all the wicked things that have been done in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem by your ancestors, by the kings of Judah and their wives, and by you and your wives?"
Jeremiah,44,10,But to this day you have not humbled yourselves. You have not honoured me or lived according to all the laws that I gave you and your ancestors.
Jeremiah,44,11,"“So then, I, the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, will turn against you and destroy all Judah."
Jeremiah,44,12,"As for the people of Judah who are left and are determined to go and live in Egypt, I will see to it that all of them are destroyed. All of them, great and small, will die in Egypt, either in war or of starvation. They will be a horrifying sight; people will treat them with scorn and use their name as a curse."
Jeremiah,44,13,"I will punish those who live in Egypt, just as I punished Jerusalem — with war, starvation, and disease."
Jeremiah,44,14,"None of the people of Judah who are left and have come to Egypt to live will escape or survive. Not one of them will return to Judah, where they long to live once again. No one will return except a few refugees.”"
Jeremiah,44,15,"Then all the men who knew that their wives offered sacrifices to other gods, and all the women who were standing there, including the Israelites who lived in southern Egypt — a large crowd in all — said to me,"
Jeremiah,44,16,“We refuse to listen to what you have told us in the name of the LORD.
Jeremiah,44,17,"We will do everything that we said we would. We will offer sacrifices to our goddess, the Queen of Heaven, and we will pour out wine offerings to her, just as we and our ancestors, our king and our leaders, used to do in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. Then we had plenty of food, we were prosperous, and had no troubles."
Jeremiah,44,18,"But ever since we stopped sacrificing to the Queen of Heaven and stopped pouring out wine offerings to her, we have had nothing, and our people have died in war and of starvation.”"
Jeremiah,44,19,"And the women added, “When we baked cakes shaped like the Queen of Heaven, offered sacrifices to her, and poured out wine offerings to her, our husbands approved of what we were doing.”"
Jeremiah,44,20,"Then I said to all the men and the women who had answered me in this way,"
Jeremiah,44,21,"“As for the sacrifices which you and your ancestors, your kings and your leaders, and the people of the land offered in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem — do you think that the LORD did not know about them or that he forgot them?"
Jeremiah,44,22,"This very day your land lies in ruins and no one lives in it. It has become a horrifying sight, and people use its name as a curse because the LORD could no longer endure your wicked and evil practices."
Jeremiah,44,23,This present disaster has come on you because you offered sacrifices to other gods and sinned against the LORD by not obeying all his commands.”
Jeremiah,45,1," In the fourth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was king of Judah, Baruch wrote down what I had dictated to him. Then I told him"
Jeremiah,45,2,"that the LORD , the God of Israel, had said, “Baruch,"
Jeremiah,45,3,"you are saying, ‘I give up! The LORD has added sorrow to my troubles. I am worn out from groaning, and I can't find any rest!’"
Jeremiah,45,4,"“But I, the LORD , am tearing down what I have built and pulling up what I have planted. I will do this to the entire earth."
Jeremiah,45,5,"Are you looking for special treatment for yourself? Don't do it. I am bringing disaster on the whole human race, but you will at least escape with your life wherever you go. I, the LORD , have spoken.”"
Jeremiah,46,1,"The LORD spoke to me about the nations,"
Jeremiah,46,2,"beginning with Egypt. This is what he said about the army of King Neco of Egypt, which King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia defeated at Carchemish near the River Euphrates in the fourth year that Jehoiakim was king of Judah:"
Jeremiah,46,3,"“The Egyptian officers shout, ‘Get your shields ready and march into battle!"
Jeremiah,46,4,Harness your horses and mount them! Fall in line and put on your helmets! Sharpen your spears! Put on your armour!’
Jeremiah,46,5,"“But what do I see?” asks the LORD. “They are turning back in terror. Their soldiers are beaten back; overcome with fear, they run as fast as they can and do not look back."
Jeremiah,46,6,"Those who run fast cannot get away; the soldiers cannot escape. In the north, by the Euphrates, they stumble and fall."
Jeremiah,46,7,"Who is this that rises like the Nile, like a river flooding its banks?"
Jeremiah,46,8,"It is Egypt, rising like the Nile, like a river flooding its banks. Egypt said, ‘I will rise and cover the world; I will destroy cities and the people who live there."
Jeremiah,46,9,"Command the horses to go and the chariots to roll! Send out the soldiers: men from Ethiopia and Libya, carrying shields, and skilled archers from Lydia.’ ”"
Jeremiah,46,10,"This is the day of the Sovereign LORD Almighty: today he will take revenge; today he will punish his enemies. His sword will eat them until it is full, and drink their blood until it is satisfied. Today the Almighty sacrifices his victims in the north, by the Euphrates."
Jeremiah,46,11,"People of Egypt, go to Gilead and look for medicine! All your medicine has proved useless; nothing can heal you."
Jeremiah,46,12,"Nations have heard of your shame; everyone has heard you cry. One soldier trips over another, and both of them fall to the ground."
Jeremiah,46,13," When King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia came to attack Egypt, the LORD spoke to me. He said,"
Jeremiah,46,14,"“Proclaim it in the towns of Egypt, in Migdol, Memphis, and Tahpanhes: ‘Get ready to defend yourselves; all you have will be destroyed in war!"
