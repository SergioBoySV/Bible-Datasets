Exodus,1,1," The sons of Jacob who went to Egypt with him, each with his family, were"
Exodus,1,2,"Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah,"
Exodus,1,3,"Issachar, Zebulun, Benjamin,"
Exodus,1,4,"Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher."
Exodus,1,5,The total number of these people directly descended from Jacob was seventy. His son Joseph was already in Egypt.
Exodus,1,6,"In the course of time Joseph, his brothers, and all the rest of that generation died,"
Exodus,1,7,"but their descendants, the Israelites, had many children and became so numerous and strong that Egypt was filled with them."
Exodus,1,8," Then, a new king, who knew nothing about Joseph, came to power in Egypt."
Exodus,1,9,"He said to his people, “These Israelites are so numerous and strong that they are a threat to us."
Exodus,1,10,"In case of war they might join our enemies in order to fight against us, and might escape from the country. We must find some way to keep them from becoming even more numerous.”"
Exodus,1,11,So the Egyptians put slave-drivers over them to crush their spirits with hard labour. The Israelites built the cities of Pithom and Rameses to serve as supply centres for the king.
Exodus,1,12,"But the more the Egyptians oppressed the Israelites, the more they increased in number and the further they spread through the land. The Egyptians came to fear the Israelites"
Exodus,2,1,"During this time a man from the tribe of Levi married a woman of his own tribe,"
Exodus,2,2,"and she bore him a son. When she saw what a fine baby he was, she hid him for three months."
Exodus,2,3,"But when she could not hide him any longer, she took a basket made of reeds and covered it with tar to make it watertight. She put the baby in it and then placed it in the tall grass at the edge of the river."
Exodus,2,4,The baby's sister stood some distance away to see what would happen to him.
Exodus,2,5,"The king's daughter came down to the river to bathe, while her servants walked along the bank. Suddenly she noticed the basket in the tall grass and sent a slave woman to get it."
Exodus,2,6,"The princess opened it and saw a baby boy. He was crying, and she felt sorry for him. “This is one of the Hebrew babies,” she said."
Exodus,2,7,"Then his sister asked her, “Shall I go and call a Hebrew woman to act as a wet nurse?”"
Exodus,2,8,"“Please do,” she answered. So the girl went and brought the baby's own mother."
Exodus,2,9,"The princess told the woman, “Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I will pay you.” So she took the baby and nursed him."
Exodus,2,10,"Later, when the child was old enough, she took him to the king's daughter, who adopted him as her own son. She said to herself, “I pulled him out of the water, and so I name him Moses.”"
Exodus,2,11," When Moses had grown up, he went out to visit his people, the Hebrews, and he saw how they were forced to do hard labour. He even saw an Egyptian kill a Hebrew, one of Moses' own people."
Exodus,2,12,"Moses looked all round, and when he saw that no one was watching, he killed the Egyptian and hid his body in the sand."
Exodus,2,13,"The next day he went back and saw two Hebrew men fighting. He said to the one who was in the wrong, “Why are you beating up a fellow-Hebrew?”"
Exodus,2,14,"The man answered, “Who made you our ruler and judge? Are you going to kill me just as you killed that Egyptian?” Then Moses was afraid and said to himself, “People have found out what I have done.”"
Exodus,3,1,"One day while Moses was taking care of the sheep and goats of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian, he led the flock across the desert and came to Sinai, the holy mountain."
Exodus,3,2,There the angel of the LORD appeared to him as a flame coming from the middle of a bush. Moses saw that the bush was on fire but that it was not burning up.
Exodus,3,3,"“This is strange,” he thought. “Why isn't the bush burning up? I will go closer and see.”"
Exodus,3,4,"When the LORD saw that Moses was coming closer, he called to him from the middle of the bush and said, “Moses! Moses!” He answered, “Yes, here I am.”"
Exodus,3,5,"God said, “Do not come any closer. Take off your sandals, because you are standing on holy ground."
Exodus,3,6,"I am the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.” So Moses covered his face, because he was afraid to look at God."
Exodus,3,7,"Then the LORD said, “I have seen how cruelly my people are being treated in Egypt; I have heard them cry out to be rescued from their slave-drivers. I know all about their sufferings,"
Exodus,3,8,"and so I have come down to rescue them from the Egyptians and to bring them out of Egypt to a spacious land, one which is rich and fertile and in which the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites now live."
Exodus,3,9,"I have indeed heard the cry of my people, and I see how the Egyptians are oppressing them."
Exodus,3,10,Now I am sending you to the king of Egypt so that you can lead my people out of his country.”
Exodus,3,11,"But Moses said to God, “I am nobody. How can I go to the king and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?”"
Exodus,3,12,"God answered, “I will be with you, and when you bring the people out of Egypt, you will worship me on this mountain. That will be the proof that I have sent you.”"
Exodus,3,13," But Moses replied, “When I go to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your ancestors sent me to you,’ they will ask me, ‘What is his name?’ So what can I tell them?”"
Exodus,3,14," God said, “I am who I am. This is what you must say to them: ‘The one who is called I AM has sent me to you.’"
Exodus,3,15,"Tell the Israelites that I, the LORD , the God of their ancestors, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, have sent you to them. This is my name for ever; this is what all future generations are to call me."
Exodus,3,16,"Go and gather the leaders of Israel together and tell them that I, the LORD , the God of their ancestors, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, appeared to you. Tell them that I have come to them and have seen what the Egyptians are doing to them."
Exodus,3,17,"I have decided that I will bring them out of Egypt, where they are being treated cruelly, and will take them to a rich and fertile land — the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites."
Exodus,3,18,"“My people will listen to what you say to them. Then you must go with the leaders of Israel to the king of Egypt and say to him, ‘The LORD , the God of the Hebrews, has revealed himself to us. Now allow us to travel for three days into the desert to offer sacrifices to the LORD , our God.’"
Exodus,3,19,I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless he is forced to do so.
Exodus,3,20,But I will use my power and will punish Egypt by doing terrifying things there. After that he will let you go.
Exodus,3,21," “I will make the Egyptians respect you so that when my people leave, they will not go empty-handed."
Exodus,3,22,Every Israelite woman will go to her Egyptian neighbours and to any Egyptian woman living in her house and will ask for clothing and for gold and silver jewellery. The Israelites will put these things on their sons and daughters and carry away the wealth of the Egyptians.”
Exodus,4,1,"Then Moses answered the LORD , “But suppose the Israelites do not believe me and will not listen to what I say. What shall I do if they say that you did not appear to me?”"
Exodus,4,2,"So the LORD asked him, “What are you holding?” “A stick,” he answered."
Exodus,4,3,"The LORD said, “Throw it on the ground.” When Moses threw it down, it turned into a snake, and he ran away from it."
Exodus,4,4,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Bend down and pick it up by the tail.” So Moses bent down and caught it, and it became a stick again."
Exodus,4,5,"The LORD said, “Do this to prove to the Israelites that the LORD , the God of their ancestors, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, has appeared to you.”"
Exodus,4,6,"The LORD spoke to Moses again, “Put your hand inside your robe.” Moses obeyed; and when he took his hand out, it was diseased, covered with white spots, like snow."
Exodus,4,7,"Then the LORD said, “Put your hand inside your robe again.” He did so, and when he took it out this time, it was healthy, just like the rest of his body."
Exodus,4,8,"The LORD said, “If they will not believe you or be convinced by the first miracle, then this one will convince them."
Exodus,4,9,"If in spite of these two miracles they still will not believe you, and if they refuse to listen to what you say, take some water from the Nile and pour it on the ground. The water will turn into blood.”"
Exodus,4,10,"But Moses said, “No, LORD , don't send me. I have never been a good speaker, and I haven't become one since you began to speak to me. I am a poor speaker, slow and hesitant.”"
Exodus,4,11,"The LORD said to him, “Who gives man his mouth? Who makes him deaf or dumb? Who gives him sight or makes him blind? It is I, the LORD."
Exodus,4,12,"Now, go! I will help you to speak, and I will tell you what to say.”"
Exodus,4,13,"But Moses answered, “No, Lord, please send someone else.”"
Exodus,4,14,"At this the LORD became angry with Moses and said, “What about your brother Aaron, the Levite? I know that he can speak well. In fact, he is now coming to meet you and will be glad to see you."
Exodus,4,15,"You can speak to him and tell him what to say. I will help both of you to speak, and I will tell you both what to do."
Exodus,4,16,"He will be your spokesman and speak to the people for you. Then you will be like God, telling him what to say."
Exodus,4,17,Take this stick with you; for with it you will perform miracles.”
Exodus,4,18,"Then Moses went back to Jethro, his father-in-law, and said to him, “Please let me go back to my relatives in Egypt to see if they are still alive.” Jethro agreed and said goodbye to him."
Exodus,4,19,"While Moses was still in Midian, the LORD said to him, “Go back to Egypt, for all those who wanted to kill you are dead.”"
Exodus,4,20,"So Moses took his wife and his sons, put them on a donkey, and set out with them for Egypt, carrying the stick that God had told him to take."
Exodus,4,21,"Again the LORD said to Moses, “Now that you are going back to Egypt, be sure to perform before the king all the miracles which I have given you the power to do. But I will make the king stubborn, and he will not let the people go."
Exodus,4,22,"Then you must tell him that I, the LORD , say, ‘Israel is my firstborn son."
Exodus,4,23,"I told you to let my son go, so that he might worship me, but you refused. Now I am going to kill your firstborn son.’ ”"
Exodus,4,24,"At a camping place on the way to Egypt, the LORD met Moses and tried to kill him."
Exodus,5,1,"Then Moses and Aaron went to the king of Egypt and said, “The LORD , the God of Israel, says, ‘Let my people go, so that they can hold a festival in the desert to honour me.’ ”"
Exodus,5,2,“Who is the LORD ?” the king demanded. “Why should I listen to him and let Israel go? I do not know the LORD ; and I will not let Israel go.”
Exodus,5,3,"Moses and Aaron replied, “The God of the Hebrews has revealed himself to us. Allow us to travel for three days into the desert to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God. If we don't do so, he will kill us with disease or by war.”"
Exodus,5,4,"The king said to Moses and Aaron, “What do you mean by making the people neglect their work? Get those slaves back to work!"
Exodus,5,5,You people have become more numerous than the Egyptians. And now you want to stop working!”
Exodus,5,6,That same day the king commanded the Egyptian slave-drivers and the Israelite foremen:
Exodus,5,7,“Stop giving the people straw for making bricks. Make them go and find it for themselves.
Exodus,5,8,"But still require them to make the same number of bricks as before, not one brick less. They haven't enough work to do, and that is why they keep asking me to let them go and offer sacrifices to their God!"
Exodus,5,9,"Make these people work harder and keep them busy, so that they won't have time to listen to a pack of lies.”"
Exodus,5,10,"The slave-drivers and the Israelite foremen went out and said to the Israelites, “The king has said that he will not supply you with any more straw."
Exodus,5,11,"He says that you must go and get it for yourselves wherever you can find it, but you must still make the same number of bricks.”"
Exodus,5,12,So the people went all over Egypt looking for straw.
Exodus,5,13,The slave-drivers kept trying to force them to make the same number of bricks every day as they had made when they were given straw.
Exodus,5,14,"The Egyptian slave-drivers beat the Israelite foremen, whom they had put in charge of the work. They demanded, “Why aren't you people making the same number of bricks as you made before?”"
Exodus,5,15,"Then the foremen went to the king and complained, “Why do you do this to us, Your Majesty?"
Exodus,5,16,"We are given no straw, but we are still ordered to make bricks! And now we are being beaten. It is your people that are at fault.”"
Exodus,5,17,"The king answered, “You are lazy and don't want to work, and that is why you ask me to let you go and offer sacrifices to the LORD."
Exodus,5,18,"Now get back to work! You will not be given any straw, but you must still make the same number of bricks.”"
Exodus,5,19,The foremen realized that they were in trouble when they were told that they had to make the same number of bricks every day as they had made before.
Exodus,5,20,"As they were leaving, they met Moses and Aaron, who were waiting for them."
Exodus,5,21,"They said to Moses and Aaron, “The LORD has seen what you have done and will punish you for making the king and his officers hate us. You have given them an excuse to kill us.”"
Exodus,5,22,"Then Moses turned to the LORD again and said, “Lord, why do you ill-treat your people? Why did you send me here?"
Exodus,5,23,"Ever since I went to the king to speak for you, he has treated them cruelly. And you have done nothing to help them!”"
Exodus,6,1,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Now you are going to see what I will do to the king. I will force him to let my people go. In fact, I will force him to drive them out of his land.”"
Exodus,6,2," God spoke to Moses and said, “I am the LORD."
Exodus,6,3,"I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as Almighty God, but I did not make myself known to them by my holy name, the LORD."
Exodus,6,4,"I also made my covenant with them, promising to give them the land of Canaan, the land in which they had lived as foreigners."
Exodus,6,5,"Now I have heard the groaning of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians have enslaved, and I have remembered my covenant."
Exodus,6,6,"So tell the Israelites that I say to them, ‘I am the LORD ; I will rescue you and set you free from your slavery to the Egyptians. I will raise my mighty arm to bring terrible punishment upon them, and I will save you."
Exodus,6,7,"I will make you my own people, and I will be your God. You will know that I am the LORD your God when I set you free from slavery in Egypt."
Exodus,6,8,"I will bring you to the land that I solemnly promised to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and I will give it to you as your own possession. I am the LORD .’ ”"
Exodus,6,9,"Moses told this to the Israelites, but they would not listen to him, because their spirit had been broken by their cruel slavery."
Exodus,6,10,"Then the LORD said to Moses,"
Exodus,6,11,“Go and tell the king of Egypt that he must let the Israelites leave his land.”
Exodus,6,12,"But Moses replied, “Even the Israelites will not listen to me, so why should the king? I am such a poor speaker.”"
Exodus,6,13,The LORD commanded Moses and Aaron: “Tell the Israelites and the king of Egypt that I have ordered you to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.”
Exodus,6,14,"Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, had four sons: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi; they were the ancestors of the clans that bear their names."
Exodus,6,15,"Simeon had six sons: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman; they were the ancestors of the clans that bear their names."
Exodus,6,16,"Levi had three sons: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari; they were the ancestors of the clans that bear their names. Levi lived 137 years."
Exodus,6,17,"Gershon had two sons: Libni and Shimei, and they had many descendants."
Exodus,6,18,"Kohath had four sons: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. Kohath lived 133 years."
Exodus,6,19,Merari had two sons: Mahli and Mushi. These are the clans of Levi with their descendants.
Exodus,6,20,"Amram married his father's sister Jochebed, who bore him Aaron and Moses. Amram lived 137 years."
Exodus,6,21,"Izhar had three sons: Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri."
Exodus,6,22,"Uzziel also had three sons: Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri."
Exodus,6,23,"Aaron married Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab and sister of Nahshon; she bore him Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar."
Exodus,6,24,"Korah had three sons: Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph; they were the ancestors of the divisions of the clan of Korah."
Exodus,6,25,"Eleazar, Aaron's son, married one of Putiel's daughters, who bore him Phinehas. These were the heads of the families and the clans of the tribe of Levi."
Exodus,6,26,"Aaron and Moses were the ones to whom the LORD said, “Lead the tribes of Israel out of Egypt.”"
Exodus,6,27,They were the men who told the king of Egypt to free the Israelites.
Exodus,6,28,"When the LORD spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,"
Exodus,6,29,"he said, “I am the LORD . Tell the king of Egypt everything I tell you.”"
Exodus,6,30,"But Moses answered, “You know that I am such a poor speaker; why should the king listen to me?”"
Exodus,7,1,"The LORD said, “I am going to make you like God to the king, and your brother Aaron will speak to him as your prophet."
Exodus,7,2,"Tell Aaron everything I command you, and he will tell the king to let the Israelites leave his country."
Exodus,8,1,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go to the king and tell him that the LORD says, ‘Let my people go, so that they can worship me."
Exodus,8,2,"If you refuse, I will punish your country by covering it with frogs."
Exodus,8,3,"The Nile will be so full of frogs that they will leave it and go into your palace, your bedroom, your bed, the houses of your officials and your people, and even into your ovens and baking pans."
Exodus,8,4,"They will jump up on you, your people, and all your officials.’ ”"
Exodus,8,5,"The LORD said to Moses, “Tell Aaron to hold out his stick over the rivers, the canals, and the pools, and make frogs come up and cover the land of Egypt.”"
Exodus,8,6,"So Aaron held it out over all the water, and the frogs came out and covered the land."
Exodus,8,7,"But the magicians used magic, and they too made frogs come up on the land."
Exodus,8,8,"The king called for Moses and Aaron and said, “Pray to the LORD to take away these frogs, and I will let your people go, so that they can offer sacrifices to the LORD .”"
Exodus,8,9,"Moses replied, “I will be glad to pray for you. Just set the time when I am to pray for you, your officers, and your people. Then you will be rid of the frogs, and there will be none left except in the Nile.”"
Exodus,8,10,"The king answered, “Pray for me tomorrow.” Moses said, “I will do as you ask, and then you will know that there is no other god like the LORD , our God."
Exodus,8,11,"You, your officials, and your people will be rid of the frogs, and there will be none left except in the Nile.”"
Exodus,8,12,"Then Moses and Aaron left the king, and Moses prayed to the LORD to take away the frogs which he had brought on the king."
Exodus,8,13,"The LORD did as Moses asked, and the frogs in the houses, the courtyards, and the fields died."
Exodus,8,14,"The Egyptians piled them up in great heaps, until the land stank with them."
Exodus,8,15,"When the king saw that the frogs were dead, he became stubborn again and, just as the LORD had said, the king would not listen to Moses and Aaron."
Exodus,8,16,"The LORD said to Moses, “Tell Aaron to strike the ground with his stick, and all over the land of Egypt the dust will change into gnats.”"
Exodus,8,17,"So Aaron struck the ground with his stick, and all the dust in Egypt was turned into gnats, which covered the people and the animals."
Exodus,8,18,"The magicians tried to use their magic to make gnats appear, but they failed. There were gnats everywhere,"
Exodus,8,19,"and the magicians said to the king, “God has done this!” But the king was stubborn and, just as the LORD had said, the king would not listen to Moses and Aaron."
Exodus,8,20,"The LORD said to Moses, “Early tomorrow morning go and meet the king as he goes to the river, and tell him that the LORD says, ‘Let my people go, so that they can worship me."
Exodus,8,21,"I warn you that if you refuse, I will punish you by sending flies on you, your officials, and your people. The houses of the Egyptians will be full of flies, and the ground will be covered with them."
Exodus,8,22,"But I will spare the region of Goshen, where my people live, so that there will be no flies there. I will do this so that you will know that I, the LORD , am at work in this land."
Exodus,8,23,I will make a distinction between my people and your people. This miracle will take place tomorrow.’ ”
Exodus,8,24,The LORD sent great swarms of flies into the king's palace and the houses of his officials. The whole land of Egypt was brought to ruin by the flies.
Exodus,8,25,"Then the king called for Moses and Aaron and said, “Go and offer sacrifices to your God here in this country.”"
Exodus,8,26,"“It would not be right to do that,” Moses answered, “because the Egyptians would be offended by our sacrificing the animals that we offer to the LORD our God. If we use these animals and offend the Egyptians by sacrificing them where they can see us, they will stone us to death."
Exodus,8,27,"We must travel three days into the desert to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God, just as he commanded us.”"
Exodus,8,28,"The king said, “I will let you go to sacrifice to the LORD , your God, in the desert, if you do not go very far. Pray for me.”"
Exodus,8,29,"Moses answered, “As soon as I leave, I will pray to the LORD that tomorrow the flies will leave you, your officials, and your people. But you must not deceive us again and prevent the people from going to sacrifice to the LORD .”"
Exodus,8,30,"Moses left the king and prayed to the LORD,"
Exodus,8,31,"and the LORD did as Moses asked. The flies left the king, his officials, and his people; not one fly remained."
Exodus,8,32,"But even this time the king became stubborn, and again he would not let the people go."
Exodus,9,1,"The LORD said to Moses, “Go to the king and tell him that the LORD , the God of the Hebrews, says, ‘Let my people go, so that they may worship me."
Exodus,9,2,"If you again refuse to let them go,"
Exodus,9,3,"I will punish you by sending a terrible disease on all your animals — your horses, donkeys, camels, cattle, sheep, and goats."
Exodus,9,4,"I will make a distinction between the animals of the Israelites and those of the Egyptians, and no animal that belongs to the Israelites will die."
Exodus,9,5,"I, the LORD , have set tomorrow as the time when I will do this.’ ”"
Exodus,9,6,"The next day the LORD did as he had said, and all the animals of the Egyptians died, but not one of the animals of the Israelites died."
Exodus,9,7,The king asked what had happened and was told that none of the animals of the Israelites had died. But he was stubborn and would not let the people go.
Exodus,9,8,"Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “Take a few handfuls of ashes from a furnace; Moses shall throw them into the air in front of the king."
Exodus,9,9,"They will spread out like fine dust over all the land of Egypt, and everywhere they will produce boils that become open sores on the people and the animals.”"
Exodus,9,10,"So they got some ashes and stood before the king; Moses threw them into the air, and they produced boils that became open sores on the people and the animals."
Exodus,9,11,"The magicians were not able to appear before Moses, because they were covered with boils, like all the other Egyptians."
Exodus,9,12,"But the LORD made the king stubborn and, just as the LORD had said, the king would not listen to Moses and Aaron."
Exodus,9,13,"The LORD then said to Moses, “Early tomorrow morning meet with the king and tell him that the LORD , the God of the Hebrews, says, ‘Let my people go, so that they may worship me."
Exodus,9,14,"This time I will punish not only your officials and your people, but I will punish you as well, so that you may know that there is no one like me in all the world."
Exodus,9,15,"If I had raised my hand to strike you and your people with disease, you would have been completely destroyed."
Exodus,9,16,But to show you my power I have let you live so that my fame might spread over the whole world.
Exodus,9,17,Yet you are still arrogant and refuse to let my people go.
Exodus,9,18,"This time tomorrow I will cause a heavy hailstorm, such as Egypt has never known in all its history."
Exodus,9,19,"Now give orders for your livestock and everything else you have in the open to be put under shelter. Hail will fall on the people and animals left outside unprotected, and they will all die.’ ”"
Exodus,9,20,"Some of the king's officials were afraid because of what the LORD had said, and they brought their slaves and animals indoors for shelter."
Exodus,9,21,"Others, however, paid no attention to the LORD 's warning and left their slaves and animals out in the open."
Exodus,9,22,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Raise your hand towards the sky, and hail will fall over the whole land of Egypt — on the people, the animals, and all the plants in the fields.”"
Exodus,9,23,"So Moses raised his stick towards the sky, and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and lightning struck the ground. The LORD sent"
Exodus,9,24,"a heavy hailstorm, with lightning flashing to and fro. It was the worst storm that Egypt had ever known in all its history."
Exodus,9,25,"All over Egypt the hail struck down everything in the open, including all the people and all the animals. It beat down all the plants in the fields and broke all the trees."
Exodus,9,26,"The region of Goshen, where the Israelites lived, was the only place where there was no hail."
Exodus,9,27,"The king sent for Moses and Aaron and said, “This time I have sinned; the LORD is in the right, and my people and I are in the wrong."
Exodus,9,28,Pray to the LORD ! We have had enough of this thunder and hail! I promise to let you go; you don't have to stay here any longer.”
Exodus,9,29,"Moses said to him, “As soon as I go out of the city, I will lift up my hands in prayer to the LORD . The thunder will stop, and there will be no more hail, so that you may know that the earth belongs to the LORD."
Exodus,9,30,But I know that you and your officials do not yet fear the LORD God.”
Exodus,9,31,"The flax and the barley were ruined, because the barley was ripe, and the flax was budding."
Exodus,9,32,"But none of the wheat was ruined, because it ripens later."
Exodus,9,33,"Moses left the king, went out of the city, and lifted up his hands in prayer to the LORD . The thunder, the hail, and the rain all stopped."
Exodus,9,34,"When the king saw what had happened, he sinned again. He and his officials remained as stubborn as ever"
Exodus,9,35,"and, just as the LORD had foretold through Moses, the king would not let the Israelites go."
Exodus,10,1,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go and see the king. I have made him and his officials stubborn, in order that I may perform these miracles among them"
Exodus,10,2,and in order that you may be able to tell your children and grandchildren how I made fools of the Egyptians when I performed the miracles. All of you will know that I am the LORD .”
Exodus,10,3,"So Moses and Aaron went to the king and said to him, “The LORD , the God of the Hebrews, says ‘How much longer will you refuse to submit to me? Let my people go, so that they may worship me."
Exodus,10,4,"If you keep on refusing, then I will bring locusts into your country tomorrow."
Exodus,10,5,"There will be so many that they will completely cover the ground. They will eat everything that the hail did not destroy, even the trees that are left."
Exodus,10,6,They will fill your palaces and the houses of all your officials and all your people. They will be worse than anything your ancestors ever saw.’ ” Then Moses turned and left.
Exodus,10,7,"The king's officials said to him, “How long is this man going to give us trouble? Let the Israelite men go, so that they can worship the LORD their God. Don't you realize that Egypt is ruined?”"
Exodus,10,8,"So Moses and Aaron were brought back to the king, and he said to them, “You may go and worship the LORD your God. But exactly who will go?”"
Exodus,10,9,"Moses answered, “We will all go, including our children and our old people. We will take our sons and daughters, our sheep and goats, and our cattle, because we must hold a festival to honour the LORD .”"
Exodus,10,10,"The king said, “I swear by the LORD that I will never let you take your women and children! It is clear that you are plotting to revolt."
Exodus,10,11,"No! Only the men may go and worship the LORD if that is what you want.” With that, Moses and Aaron were driven out of the king's presence."
Exodus,10,12,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Raise your hand over the land of Egypt to bring the locusts. They will come and eat everything that grows, everything that has survived the hail.”"
Exodus,10,13,"So Moses raised his stick, and the LORD caused a wind from the east to blow on the land all that day and all that night. By morning it had brought the locusts."
Exodus,10,14,They came in swarms and settled over the whole country. It was the largest swarm of locusts that had ever been seen or that ever would be seen again.
Exodus,10,15,"They covered the ground until it was black with them; they ate everything that the hail had left, including all the fruit on the trees. Not a green thing was left on any tree or plant in all the land of Egypt."
Exodus,10,16,"Then the king hurriedly called Moses and Aaron and said, “I have sinned against the LORD your God and against you."
Exodus,10,17,Now forgive my sin this once and pray to the LORD your God to take away this fatal punishment from me.”
Exodus,10,18,Moses left the king and prayed to the LORD.
Exodus,10,19,"And the LORD changed the east wind into a very strong west wind, which picked up the locusts and blew them into the Gulf of Suez. Not one locust was left in all Egypt."
Exodus,10,20,"But the LORD made the king stubborn, and he did not let the Israelites go."
Exodus,10,21,"The LORD then said to Moses, “Raise your hand towards the sky, and a darkness thick enough to be felt will cover the land of Egypt.”"
Exodus,10,22,"Moses raised his hand towards the sky, and there was total darkness throughout Egypt for three days."
Exodus,10,23,"The Egyptians could not see each other, and no one left his house during that time. But the Israelites had light where they were living."
Exodus,10,24,"The king called Moses and said, “You may go and worship the LORD ; even your women and children may go with you. But your sheep, goats, and cattle must stay here.”"
Exodus,10,25,"Moses answered, “Then you would have to provide us with animals for sacrifices and burnt offerings to offer to the LORD our God."
Exodus,10,26,"No, we will take our animals with us; not one will be left behind. We ourselves must select the animals with which to worship the LORD our God. And until we get there, we will not know what animals to sacrifice to him.”"
Exodus,10,27,"The LORD made the king stubborn, and he would not let them go."
Exodus,10,28,"He said to Moses, “Get out of my sight! Don't let me ever see you again! On the day I do, you will die!”"
Exodus,10,29,"“You are right,” Moses answered. “You will never see me again.”"
Exodus,11,1,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “I will send only one more punishment on the king of Egypt and his people. After that he will let you leave. In fact, he will drive all of you out of here."
Exodus,11,2,Now speak to the people of Israel and tell all of them to ask their neighbours for gold and silver jewellery.”
Exodus,11,3,"The LORD made the Egyptians respect the Israelites. Indeed, the officials and all the people considered Moses to be a very great man."
Exodus,11,4,"Moses then said to the king, “The LORD says, ‘At about midnight I will go through Egypt,"
Exodus,11,5,"and every firstborn son in Egypt will die, from the king's son, who is heir to the throne, to the son of the slave woman who grinds corn. The firstborn of all the cattle will die also."
Exodus,11,6,"There will be loud crying all over Egypt, such as there has never been before or ever will be again."
Exodus,11,7,"But not even a dog will bark at the Israelites or their animals. Then you will know that I, the LORD , make a distinction between the Egyptians and the Israelites.’ ”"
Exodus,11,8,"Moses concluded by saying, “All your officials will come to me and bow down before me, and they will beg me to take all my people and go away. After that, I will leave.” Then in great anger Moses left the king."
Exodus,11,9,"The LORD had said to Moses, “The king will continue to refuse to listen to you, in order that I may do more of my miracles in Egypt.”"
Exodus,11,10,"Moses and Aaron performed all these miracles before the king, but the LORD made him stubborn, and he would not let the Israelites leave his country."
Exodus,12,1, The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron in Egypt:
Exodus,12,2,“This month is to be the first month of the year for you.
Exodus,12,3,Give these instructions to the whole community of Israel: on the tenth day of this month each man must choose either a lamb or a young goat for his household.
Exodus,12,4,"If his family is too small to eat a whole animal, he and his next-door neighbour may share an animal, in proportion to the number of people and the amount that each person can eat."
Exodus,12,5,"You may choose either a sheep or a goat, but it must be a one-year-old male without any defects."
Exodus,12,6,"Then, on the evening of the fourteenth day of the month, the whole community of Israel will kill the animals."
Exodus,12,7,The people are to take some of the blood and put it on the doorposts and above the doors of the houses in which the animals are to be eaten.
Exodus,12,8,"That night the meat is to be roasted, and eaten with bitter herbs and with bread made without yeast."
Exodus,12,9,"Do not eat any of it raw or boiled, but eat it roasted whole, including the head, the legs, and the internal organs."
Exodus,12,10,"You must not leave any of it until morning; if any is left over, it must be burnt."
Exodus,12,11,"You are to eat it quickly, for you are to be dressed for travel, with your sandals on your feet and your stick in your hand. It is the Passover Festival to honour me, the LORD."
Exodus,12,12,"“On that night I will go through the land of Egypt, killing every firstborn male, both human and animal, and punishing all the gods of Egypt. I am the LORD."
Exodus,12,13,"The blood on the doorposts will be a sign to mark the houses in which you live. When I see the blood, I will pass over you and will not harm you when I punish the Egyptians."
Exodus,12,14,"You must celebrate this day as a religious festival to remind you of what I, the LORD , have done. Celebrate it for all time to come.”"
Exodus,12,15,"The LORD said, “For seven days you must not eat any bread made with yeast — eat only unleavened bread. On the first day you are to get rid of all the yeast in your houses, for if anyone during those seven days eats bread made with yeast, he shall no longer be considered one of my people."
Exodus,12,16,"On the first day and again on the seventh day you are to meet for worship. No work is to be done on those days, but you may prepare food."
Exodus,12,17,"Keep this festival, because it was on this day that I brought your tribes out of Egypt. For all time to come you must celebrate this day as a festival."
Exodus,12,18,"From the evening of the fourteenth day of the first month to the evening of the 21st day, you must not eat any bread made with yeast."
Exodus,13,1,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Exodus,13,2,"“Dedicate all the firstborn males to me, for every firstborn male Israelite and every firstborn male animal belongs to me.”"
Exodus,13,3,"Moses said to the people, “Remember this day — the day on which you left Egypt, the place where you were slaves. This is the day the LORD brought you out by his great power. No leavened bread is to be eaten."
Exodus,13,4,"You are leaving Egypt on this day in the first month, the month of Abib."
Exodus,13,5,"The LORD solemnly promised your ancestors to give you the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. When he brings you into that rich and fertile land, you must celebrate this festival in the first month of every year."
Exodus,13,6,For seven days you must eat unleavened bread and on the seventh day there is to be a festival to honour the LORD.
Exodus,13,7,For seven days you must not eat any bread made with yeast; there must be no yeast or leavened bread anywhere in your land.
Exodus,13,8,"When the festival begins, explain to your sons that you do all this because of what the LORD did for you when you left Egypt."
Exodus,13,9,"This observance will be a reminder, like something tied on your hand or on your forehead; it will remind you to continue to recite and study the Law of the LORD , because the LORD brought you out of Egypt by his great power."
Exodus,13,10,Celebrate this festival at the appointed time each year.
Exodus,13,11,"“The LORD will bring you into the land of the Canaanites, which he solemnly promised to you and your ancestors. When he gives it to you,"
Exodus,13,12,"you must offer every firstborn male to the LORD . Every firstborn male of your animals belongs to the LORD,"
Exodus,13,13,"but you must buy back from him every firstborn male donkey by offering a lamb in its place. If you do not want to buy back the donkey, break its neck. You must buy back every firstborn male child of yours."
Exodus,13,14,"In the future, when your son asks what this observance means, you will answer him, ‘By using great power the LORD brought us out of Egypt, the place where we were slaves."
Exodus,13,15,"When the king of Egypt was stubborn and refused to let us go, the LORD killed every firstborn male in the land of Egypt, both human and animal. That is why we sacrifice every firstborn male animal to the LORD , but buy back our firstborn sons."
Exodus,13,16,"This observance will be a reminder, like something tied on our hands or on our foreheads; it will remind us that the LORD brought us out of Egypt by his great power.’ ”"
Exodus,13,17,"When the king of Egypt let the people go, God did not take them by the road that goes up the coast to Philistia, although it was the shortest way. God thought, “I do not want the people to change their minds and return to Egypt when they see that they are going to have to fight.”"
Exodus,13,18,"Instead, he led them in a roundabout way through the desert towards the Red Sea. The Israelites were armed for battle."
Exodus,13,19," Moses took the body of Joseph with him, as Joseph had made the Israelites solemnly promise to do. Joseph had said, “When God rescues you, you must carry my body with you from this place.”"
Exodus,13,20,The Israelites left Sukkoth and camped at Etham on the edge of the desert.
Exodus,13,21,"During the day the LORD went in front of them in a pillar of cloud to show them the way, and during the night he went in front of them in a pillar of fire to give them light, so that they could travel night and day."
Exodus,13,22,"The pillar of cloud was always in front of the people during the day, and the pillar of fire at night."
Exodus,14,1,"Then the LORD said to Moses,"
Exodus,14,2,"“Tell the Israelites to turn back and camp in front of Pi Hahiroth, between Migdol and the Red Sea, near Baal Zephon."
Exodus,14,3,The king will think that the Israelites are wandering about in the country and are closed in by the desert.
Exodus,14,4,"I will make him stubborn, and he will pursue you, and my victory over the king and his army will bring me honour. Then the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD .” The Israelites did as they were told."
Exodus,14,5,"When the king of Egypt was told that the people had escaped, he and his officials changed their minds and said, “What have we done? We have let the Israelites escape, and we have lost them as our slaves!”"
Exodus,14,6,The king got his war chariot and his army ready.
Exodus,14,7,"He set out with all his chariots, including the 600 finest, commanded by their officers."
Exodus,14,8,"The LORD made the king stubborn, and he pursued the Israelites, who were leaving triumphantly."
Exodus,14,9,"The Egyptian army, with all the horses, chariots, and drivers, pursued them and caught up with them where they were camped by the Red Sea near Pi Hahiroth and Baal Zephon."
Exodus,14,10,"When the Israelites saw the king and his army marching against them, they were terrified and cried out to the LORD for help."
Exodus,14,11,"They said to Moses, “Weren't there any graves in Egypt? Did you have to bring us out here in the desert to die? Look what you have done by bringing us out of Egypt!"
Exodus,14,12,Didn't we tell you before we left that this would happen? We told you to leave us alone and let us go on being slaves of the Egyptians. It would be better to be slaves there than to die here in the desert.”
Exodus,14,13,"Moses answered, “Don't be afraid! Stand your ground, and you will see what the LORD will do to save you today; you will never see these Egyptians again."
Exodus,14,14,"The LORD will fight for you, and there is no need for you to do anything.”"
Exodus,14,15,"The LORD said to Moses, “Why are you crying out for help? Tell the people to move forward."
Exodus,14,16,"Lift up your stick and hold it out over the sea. The water will divide, and the Israelites will be able to walk through the sea on dry ground."
Exodus,14,17,"I will make the Egyptians so stubborn that they will go in after them, and I will gain honour by my victory over the king, his army, his chariots, and his drivers."
Exodus,14,18,"When I defeat them, the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD .”"
Exodus,14,19,"The angel of God, who had been in front of the army of Israel, moved and went to the rear. The pillar of cloud also moved until it was"
Exodus,14,20,"between the Egyptians and the Israelites. The cloud made it dark for the Egyptians, but gave light to the people of Israel, and so the armies could not come near each other all night."
Exodus,14,21," Moses held out his hand over the sea, and the LORD drove the sea back with a strong east wind. It blew all night and turned the sea into dry land. The water was divided,"
Exodus,14,22,"and the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with walls of water on both sides."
Exodus,14,23,"The Egyptians pursued them and went after them into the sea with all their horses, chariots, and drivers."
Exodus,14,24,Just before dawn the LORD looked down from the pillar of fire and cloud at the Egyptian army and threw them into a panic.
Exodus,14,25,"He made the wheels of their chariots get stuck, so that they moved with great difficulty. The Egyptians said, “The LORD is fighting for the Israelites against us. Let's get out of here!”"
Exodus,14,26,"The LORD said to Moses, “Hold out your hand over the sea, and the water will come back over the Egyptians and their chariots and drivers.”"
Exodus,14,27,"So Moses held out his hand over the sea, and at daybreak the water returned to its normal level. The Egyptians tried to escape from the water, but the LORD threw them into the sea."
Exodus,14,28,"The water returned and covered the chariots, the drivers, and all the Egyptian army that had followed the Israelites into the sea; not one of them was left."
Exodus,14,29,"But the Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground, with walls of water on both sides."
Exodus,14,30,"On that day the LORD saved the people of Israel from the Egyptians, and the Israelites saw them lying dead on the seashore."
Exodus,14,31,"When the Israelites saw the great power with which the LORD had defeated the Egyptians, they stood in awe of the LORD ; and they had faith in the LORD and in his servant Moses."
Exodus,15,1," Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the LORD: “I will sing to the LORD , because he has won a glorious victory; he has thrown the horses and their riders into the sea."
Exodus,15,2," The LORD is my strong defender; he is the one who has saved me. He is my God, and I will praise him, my father's God, and I will sing about his greatness."
Exodus,15,3,The LORD is a warrior; the LORD is his name.
Exodus,15,4,“He threw Egypt's army and its chariots into the sea; the best of its officers were drowned in the Red Sea.
Exodus,15,5,The deep sea covered them; they sank to the bottom like a stone.
Exodus,15,6,"“Your right hand, LORD , is awesome in power; it breaks the enemy in pieces."
Exodus,15,7,In majestic triumph you overthrow your foes; your anger blazes out and burns them up like straw.
Exodus,15,8,You blew on the sea and the water piled up high; it stood up straight like a wall; the deepest part of the sea became solid.
Exodus,15,9,"The enemy said, ‘I will pursue them and catch them; I will divide their wealth and take all I want; I will draw my sword and take all they have.’"
Exodus,15,10,"But one breath from you, LORD , and the Egyptians were drowned; they sank like lead in the terrible water."
Exodus,15,11,"“ LORD , who among the gods is like you? Who is like you, wonderful in holiness? Who can work miracles and mighty acts like yours?"
Exodus,15,12,"You stretched out your right hand, and the earth swallowed our enemies."
Exodus,15,13,"Faithful to your promise, you led the people you had rescued; by your strength you guided them to your sacred land."
Exodus,15,14,"The nations have heard, and they tremble with fear; the Philistines are seized with terror."
Exodus,15,15,The leaders of Edom are terrified; Moab's mighty men are trembling; the people of Canaan lose their courage.
Exodus,15,16,"Terror and dread fall upon them. They see your strength, O LORD, and stand helpless with fear until your people have marched past — the people you set free from slavery."
Exodus,15,17,"You bring them in and plant them on your mountain, the place that you, LORD , have chosen for your home, the Temple that you yourself have built."
Exodus,15,18,"You, LORD , will be king for ever and ever.”"
Exodus,15,19,"The Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground. But when the Egyptian chariots with their horses and drivers went into the sea, the LORD brought the water back, and it covered them."
Exodus,15,20,"The prophet Miriam, Aaron's sister, took her tambourine, and all the women followed her, playing tambourines and dancing."
Exodus,15,21,"Miriam sang for them: “Sing to the LORD , because he has won a glorious victory; he has thrown the horses and their riders into the sea.”"
Exodus,15,22,"Then Moses led the people of Israel away from the Red Sea into the desert of Shur. For three days they walked through the desert, but found no water."
Exodus,15,23,"Then they came to a place called Marah, but the water there was so bitter that they could not drink it. That is why it was named Marah."
Exodus,15,24,"The people complained to Moses and asked, “What are we going to drink?”"
Exodus,15,25,"Moses prayed earnestly to the LORD , and the LORD showed him a piece of wood, which he threw into the water; and the water became fit to drink. There the LORD gave them laws to live by, and there he also tested them."
Exodus,15,26,"He said, “If you will obey me completely by doing what I consider right and by keeping my commands, I will not punish you with any of the diseases that I brought on the Egyptians. I am the LORD , the one who heals you.”"
Exodus,15,27,"Next they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs and seventy palm trees; there they camped by the water."
Exodus,16,1,"The whole Israelite community set out from Elim, and on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had left Egypt, they came to the desert of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai."
Exodus,16,2,There in the desert they all complained to Moses and Aaron
Exodus,16,3,"and said to them, “We wish that the LORD had killed us in Egypt. There we could at least sit down and eat meat and as much other food as we wanted. But you have brought us out into this desert to starve us all to death.”"
Exodus,16,4," The LORD said to Moses, “Now I am going to make food rain down from the sky for all of you. The people must go out every day and gather enough for that day. In this way I can test them to find out if they will follow my instructions."
Exodus,16,5,On the sixth day they are to bring in twice as much as usual and prepare it.”
Exodus,16,6,"So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites, “This evening you will know that it was the LORD who brought you out of Egypt."
Exodus,16,7,"In the morning you will see the dazzling light of the LORD 's presence. He has heard your complaints against him — yes, against him, because we are only carrying out his instructions.”"
Exodus,16,8,"Then Moses said, “It is the LORD who will give you meat to eat in the evening and as much bread as you want in the morning, because he has heard how much you have complained against him. When you complain against us, you are really complaining against the LORD .”"
Exodus,16,9,"Moses said to Aaron, “Tell the whole community to come and stand before the LORD , because he has heard their complaints.”"
Exodus,16,10,"As Aaron spoke to the whole community, they turned towards the desert, and suddenly the dazzling light of the LORD appeared in a cloud."
Exodus,16,11,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Exodus,16,12,"“I have heard the complaints of the Israelites. Tell them that at twilight they will have meat to eat, and in the morning they will have all the bread they want. Then they will know that I, the LORD , am their God.”"
Exodus,16,13,"In the evening a large flock of quails flew in, enough to cover the camp, and in the morning there was dew all round the camp."
Exodus,16,14,"When the dew evaporated, there was something thin and flaky on the surface of the desert. It was as delicate as frost."
Exodus,16,15,"When the Israelites saw it, they didn't know what it was and asked each other, “What is it?” Moses said to them, “This is the food that the LORD has given you to eat."
Exodus,16,16,"The LORD has commanded that each of you is to gather as much of it as he needs, two litres for each member of his household.”"
Exodus,16,17,"The Israelites did this, some gathering more, others less."
Exodus,16,18,"When they measured it, those who gathered much did not have too much, and those who gathered less did not have too little. Each had gathered just what he needed."
Exodus,16,19,"Moses said to them, “No one is to keep any of it for tomorrow.”"
Exodus,16,20,"But some of them did not listen to Moses and saved part of it. The next morning it was full of worms and smelt rotten, and Moses was angry with them."
Exodus,16,21,"Every morning each one gathered as much as he needed; and when the sun grew hot, what was left on the ground melted."
Exodus,16,22,"On the sixth day they gathered twice as much food, four litres for each person. All the leaders of the community came and told Moses about it,"
Exodus,16,23,"and he said to them, “The LORD has commanded that tomorrow is a holy day of rest, dedicated to him. Bake today what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil. Whatever is left should be put aside and kept for tomorrow.”"
Exodus,16,24,"As Moses had commanded, they kept what was left until the next day; it did not spoil or get worms in it."
Exodus,16,25,"Moses said, “Eat this today, because today is the Sabbath, a day of rest dedicated to the LORD , and you will not find any food outside the camp."
Exodus,16,26,"You must gather food for six days, but on the seventh day, the day of rest, there will be none.”"
Exodus,16,27,"On the seventh day some of the people went out to gather food, but they did not find any."
Exodus,16,28,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “How much longer will you people refuse to obey my commands?"
Exodus,16,29,"Remember that I, the LORD , have given you a day of rest, and that is why on the sixth day I will always give you enough food for two days. Everyone is to stay where he is on the seventh day and not leave his home.”"
Exodus,16,30,So the people did no work on the seventh day.
Exodus,16,31," The people of Israel called the food manna. It was like a small white seed, and tasted like biscuits made with honey."
Exodus,16,32,"Moses said, “The LORD has commanded us to save some manna, to be kept for our descendants, so that they can see the food which he gave us to eat in the desert when he brought us out of Egypt.”"
Exodus,16,33,"Moses said to Aaron, “Take a jar, put two litres of manna in it, and place it in the LORD 's presence to be kept for our descendants.”"
Exodus,16,34,"As the LORD had commanded Moses, Aaron put it in front of the Covenant Box, so that it could be kept."
Exodus,16,35,"The Israelites ate manna for the next forty years, until they reached the land of Canaan, where they settled."
Exodus,16,36,(The standard dry measure then in use equalled twenty litres.)
Exodus,17,1,"The whole Israelite community left the desert of Sin, moving from one place to another at the command of the LORD . They made camp at Rephidim, but there was no water there to drink."
Exodus,17,2,"They complained to Moses and said, “Give us water to drink.” Moses answered, “Why are you complaining? Why are you putting the LORD to the test?”"
Exodus,17,3,"But the people were very thirsty and continued to complain to Moses. They said, “Why did you bring us out of Egypt? To kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?”"
Exodus,17,4,"Moses prayed earnestly to the LORD and said, “What can I do with these people? They are almost ready to stone me.”"
Exodus,17,5,"The LORD said to Moses, “Take some of the leaders of Israel with you, and go on ahead of the people. Take along the stick with which you struck the Nile."
Exodus,17,6,"I will stand before you on a rock at Mount Sinai. Strike the rock, and water will come out of it for the people to drink.” Moses did so in the presence of the leaders of Israel."
Exodus,17,7,"The place was named Massah and Meribah, because the Israelites complained and put the LORD to the test when they asked, “Is the LORD with us or not?”"
Exodus,17,8,The Amalekites came and attacked the Israelites at Rephidim.
Exodus,17,9,"Moses said to Joshua, “Pick out some men to go and fight the Amalekites tomorrow. I will stand on top of the hill holding the stick that God told me to carry.”"
Exodus,17,10,"Joshua did as Moses commanded him and went out to fight the Amalekites, while Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill."
Exodus,17,11,"As long as Moses held up his arms, the Israelites won, but when he put his arms down, the Amalekites started winning."
Exodus,17,12,"When Moses' arms grew tired, Aaron and Hur brought a stone for him to sit on, while they stood beside him and held up his arms, holding them steady until the sun went down."
Exodus,17,13,In this way Joshua totally defeated the Amalekites.
Exodus,17,14," Then the LORD said to Moses, “Write an account of this victory, so that it will be remembered. Tell Joshua that I will completely destroy the Amalekites.”"
Exodus,17,15,Moses built an altar and named it “The LORD is my Banner”.
Exodus,17,16,"He said, “Hold high the banner of the LORD! The LORD will continue to fight against the Amalekites for ever!”"
Exodus,18,1,"Moses' father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian, heard about everything that God had done for Moses and the people of Israel when he led them out of Egypt."
Exodus,18,2,"So he came to Moses, bringing with him Moses' wife Zipporah, who had been left behind,"
Exodus,18,3,"and Gershom and Eliezer, her two sons. (Moses had said, “I have been a foreigner in a strange land”; so he had named one son Gershom."
Exodus,18,4,"He had also said, “The God of my father helped me and saved me from being killed by the king of Egypt”; so he had named the other son Eliezer.)"
Exodus,18,5,Jethro came with Moses' wife and her two sons into the desert where Moses was camped at the holy mountain.
Exodus,18,6,"He had sent word to Moses that they were coming,"
Exodus,18,7,"so Moses went out to meet him, bowed before him, and kissed him. They asked about each other's health and then went into Moses' tent."
Exodus,18,8,Moses told Jethro everything that the LORD had done to the king and the people of Egypt in order to rescue the Israelites. He also told him about the hardships the people had faced on the way and how the LORD had saved them.
Exodus,18,9,"When Jethro heard all this, he was happy"
Exodus,18,10,"and said, “Praise the LORD , who saved you from the king and the people of Egypt! Praise the LORD , who saved his people from slavery!"
Exodus,18,11,"Now I know that the LORD is greater than all the gods, because he did this when the Egyptians treated the Israelites with such contempt.”"
Exodus,18,12,Then Jethro brought an offering to be burnt whole and other sacrifices to be offered to God; and Aaron and all the leaders of Israel went with him to eat the sacred meal as an act of worship.
Exodus,18,13,"The next day Moses was settling disputes among the people, and he was kept busy from morning till night."
Exodus,18,14,"When Jethro saw everything that Moses had to do, he asked, “What is all this that you are doing for the people? Why are you doing this all alone, with people standing here from morning till night to consult you?”"
Exodus,18,15,"Moses answered, “I must do this because the people come to me to learn God's will."
Exodus,18,16,"When two people have a dispute, they come to me, and I decide which one of them is right, and I tell them God's commands and laws.”"
Exodus,18,17,"Then Jethro said, “You are not doing it the right way."
Exodus,18,18,You will wear yourself out and these people as well. This is too much for you to do alone.
Exodus,18,19,"Now let me give you some good advice, and God will be with you. It is right for you to represent the people before God and bring their disputes to him."
Exodus,18,20,You should teach them God's commands and explain to them how they should live and what they should do.
Exodus,18,21,"But in addition, you should choose some capable men and appoint them as leaders of the people: leaders of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens. They must be God-fearing men who can be trusted and who cannot be bribed."
Exodus,18,22,"Let them serve as judges for the people on a permanent basis. They can bring all the difficult cases to you, but they themselves can decide all the smaller disputes. That will make it easier for you, as they share your burden."
Exodus,18,23,"If you do this, as God commands, you will not wear yourself out, and all these people can go home with their disputes settled.”"

Exodus,29,33,"They shall eat what was used in the ritual of forgiveness at their ordination. Only priests may eat this food, because it is sacred."
Exodus,29,34,"If some of the meat or some of the bread is not eaten by morning, it is to be burnt; it is not to be eaten, for it is sacred."
Exodus,29,35,“Perform the rites of ordination for Aaron and his sons for seven days exactly as I have commanded you.

Exodus,30,11,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Exodus,30,12,"“When you take a census of the people of Israel, each man is to pay me a price for his life, so that no disaster will come on him while the census is being taken."

Exodus,31,1,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Exodus,31,2,"“I have chosen Bezalel, the son of Uri and grandson of Hur, from the tribe of Judah,"
Exodus,31,3,"and I have filled him with my power. I have given him understanding, skill, and ability for every kind of artistic work —"
Exodus,31,4,"for planning skilful designs and working them in gold, silver, and bronze;"
Exodus,31,5,for cutting jewels to be set; for carving wood; and for every other kind of artistic work.
Exodus,31,6,"I have also selected Oholiab son of Ahisamach, from the tribe of Dan, to work with him. I have also given great ability to all the other skilled workers, so that they can make everything I have commanded to be made:"
Exodus,31,7,"the Tent of my presence, the Covenant Box and its lid, all the furnishings of the Tent,"
Exodus,31,8,"the table and its equipment, the lampstand of pure gold and all its equipment, the altar for burning incense,"
Exodus,31,9,"the altar for burnt offerings and all its equipment, the washbasin and its base,"
Exodus,31,10,"the magnificent priestly garments for Aaron and his sons to use when they serve as priests,"
Exodus,31,11,"the anointing oil, and the sweet-smelling incense for the Holy Place. In making all these things, they are to do exactly as I have commanded you.”"
Exodus,31,12,The LORD commanded Moses
Exodus,31,13,"to say to the people of Israel, “Keep the Sabbath, my day of rest, because it is a sign between you and me for all time to come, to show that I, the LORD , have made you my own people."
Exodus,31,14,"You must keep the day of rest, because it is sacred. Whoever does not keep it, but works on that day, is to be put to death."
Exodus,31,15,"You have six days in which to do your work, but the seventh day is a solemn day of rest dedicated to me. Whoever does any work on that day is to be put to death."
Exodus,31,16,The people of Israel are to keep this day as a sign of the covenant.
Exodus,31,17,"It is a permanent sign between the people of Israel and me, because I, the LORD , made heaven and earth in six days, and on the seventh day I stopped working and rested.”"
Exodus,31,18,"When God had finished speaking to Moses on Mount Sinai, he gave him the two stone tablets on which God himself had written the commandments."
Exodus,32,1," When the people saw that Moses had not come down from the mountain but was staying there a long time, they gathered round Aaron and said to him, “We do not know what has happened to this man Moses, who led us out of Egypt; so make us a god to lead us.”"
Exodus,32,2,"Aaron said to them, “Take off the gold earrings which your wives, your sons, and your daughters are wearing, and bring them to me.”"
Exodus,32,3,So all the people took off their gold earrings and brought them to Aaron.
Exodus,32,4,"He took the earrings, melted them, poured the gold into a mould, and made a gold bull calf. The people said, “Israel, this is our god, who led us out of Egypt!”"
Exodus,32,5,"Then Aaron built an altar in front of the gold bull calf and announced, “Tomorrow there will be a festival to honour the LORD .”"
Exodus,32,6,"Early the next morning they brought some animals to burn as sacrifices and others to eat as fellowship offerings. The people sat down to a feast, which turned into an orgy of drinking and sex."
Exodus,32,7,"The LORD said to Moses, “Go back down at once, because your people, whom you led out of Egypt, have sinned and rejected me."
Exodus,32,8,"They have already left the way that I commanded them to follow; they have made a bull calf out of melted gold and have worshipped it and offered sacrifices to it. They are saying that this is their god, who led them out of Egypt."
Exodus,32,9,I know how stubborn these people are.
Exodus,32,10,"Now, don't try to stop me. I am angry with them, and I am going to destroy them. Then I will make you and your descendants into a great nation.”"
Exodus,32,11," But Moses pleaded with the LORD his God and said, “ LORD , why should you be so angry with your people, whom you rescued from Egypt with great might and power?"
Exodus,32,12,"Why should the Egyptians be able to say that you led your people out of Egypt, planning to kill them in the mountains and destroy them completely? Stop being angry; change your mind and do not bring this disaster on your people."
Exodus,32,13,"Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Remember the solemn promise you made to them to give them as many descendants as there are stars in the sky and to give their descendants all that land you promised would be their possession for ever.”"
Exodus,32,14,So the LORD changed his mind and did not bring on his people the disaster he had threatened.
Exodus,32,15,"Moses went back down the mountain, carrying the two stone tablets with the commandments written on both sides."
Exodus,32,16,God himself had made the tablets and had engraved the commandments on them.
Exodus,32,17,"Joshua heard the people shouting and said to Moses, “I hear the sound of battle in the camp.”"
Exodus,32,18,"Moses said, “That doesn't sound like a shout of victory or a cry of defeat; it's the sound of singing.”"
Exodus,32,19,"When Moses came close enough to the camp to see the bull calf and to see the people dancing, he was furious. There at the foot of the mountain, he threw down the tablets he was carrying and broke them."
Exodus,32,20,"He took the bull calf which they had made, melted it, ground it into fine powder, and mixed it with water. Then he made the people of Israel drink it."
Exodus,32,21,"He said to Aaron, “What did these people do to you, that you have made them commit such a terrible sin?”"
Exodus,32,22,"Aaron answered, “Don't be angry with me; you know how determined these people are to do evil."
Exodus,32,23,"They said to me, ‘We don't know what has happened to this man Moses, who brought us out of Egypt; so make us a god to lead us.’"
Exodus,32,24,"I asked them to bring me their gold ornaments, and those who had any took them off and gave them to me. I threw the ornaments into the fire and out came this bull calf!”"
Exodus,32,25,Moses saw that Aaron had let the people get out of control and make fools of themselves in front of their enemies.
Exodus,32,26,"So he stood at the gate of the camp and shouted, “Everyone who is on the LORD 's side come over here!” So all the Levites gathered round him,"
Exodus,32,27,"and he said to them, “The LORD God of Israel commands every one of you to put on his sword and go through the camp from this gate to the other and kill his brothers, his friends, and his neighbours.”"
Exodus,32,28,"The Levites obeyed, and killed about 3,000 men that day."
Exodus,32,29,"Moses said to the Levites, “Today you have consecrated yourselves as priests in the service of the LORD by killing your sons and brothers, so the LORD has given you his blessing.”"
Exodus,32,30,"The next day Moses said to the people, “You have committed a terrible sin. But now I will again go up the mountain to the LORD ; perhaps I can obtain forgiveness for your sin.”"
Exodus,32,31,"Moses then returned to the LORD and said, “These people have committed a terrible sin. They have made a god out of gold and worshipped it."
Exodus,32,32,"Please forgive their sin; but if you won't, then remove my name from the book in which you have written the names of your people.”"
Exodus,32,33,"The LORD answered, “It is those who have sinned against me whose names I will remove from my book."
Exodus,32,34,"Now go, lead the people to the place I told you about. Remember that my angel will guide you, but the time is coming when I will punish these people for their sin.”"
Exodus,32,35,"So the LORD sent a disease on the people, because they had caused Aaron to make the gold bull calf."
Exodus,33,1," The LORD said to Moses, “Leave this place, you and the people you brought out of Egypt, and go to the land that I promised to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and to their descendants."
Exodus,33,2,"I will send an angel to guide you, and I will drive out the Canaanites, the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites."
Exodus,33,3,"You are going to a rich and fertile land. But I will not go with you myself, because you are a stubborn people, and I might destroy you on the way.”"
Exodus,33,4,"When the people heard this, they began to mourn and did not wear jewellery any more."
Exodus,33,5,"For the LORD had commanded Moses to say to them, “You are a stubborn people. If I were to go with you even for a moment, I would completely destroy you. Now take off your jewellery, and I will decide what to do with you.”"
Exodus,33,6,"So after they left Mount Sinai, the people of Israel no longer wore jewellery."
Exodus,33,7,"Whenever the people of Israel set up camp, Moses would take the sacred Tent and put it up some distance away from the camp. It was called the Tent of the LORD 's presence, and anyone who wanted to consult the LORD would go out to it."
Exodus,33,8,"Whenever Moses went out there, the people would stand at the door of their tents and watch Moses until he entered it."
Exodus,33,9,"After Moses had gone in, the pillar of cloud would come down and stay at the door of the Tent, and the LORD would speak to Moses from the cloud."
Exodus,33,10,"As soon as the people saw the pillar of cloud at the door of the Tent, they would bow down."
Exodus,33,11,"The LORD would speak with Moses face to face, just as someone speaks with a friend. Then Moses would return to the camp. But the young man who was his helper, Joshua son of Nun, stayed in the Tent."
Exodus,33,12,"Moses said to the LORD , “It is true that you have told me to lead these people to that land, but you did not tell me whom you would send with me. You have said that you know me well and are pleased with me."
Exodus,33,13,"Now if you are, tell me your plans, so that I may serve you and continue to please you. Remember also that you have chosen this nation to be your own.”"
Exodus,33,14,"The LORD said, “I will go with you, and I will give you victory.”"
Exodus,33,15,"Moses replied, “If you do not go with us, don't make us leave this place."
Exodus,33,16,How will anyone know that you are pleased with your people and with me if you do not go with us? Your presence with us will distinguish us from any other people on earth.”
Exodus,33,17,"The LORD said to Moses, “I will do just as you have asked, because I know you very well and I am pleased with you.”"
Exodus,33,18,"Then Moses requested, “Please, let me see the dazzling light of your presence.”"
Exodus,33,19," The LORD answered, “I will make all my splendour pass before you and in your presence I will pronounce my sacred name. I am the LORD , and I show compassion and pity on those I choose."
Exodus,33,20,"I will not let you see my face, because no one can see me and stay alive,"
Exodus,33,21,but here is a place beside me where you can stand on a rock.
Exodus,33,22,"When the dazzling light of my presence passes by, I will put you in an opening in the rock and cover you with my hand until I have passed by."
Exodus,33,23,"Then I will take my hand away, and you will see my back but not my face.”"
Exodus,34,1,"The LORD said to Moses, “Cut two stone tablets like the first ones, and I will write on them the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke."
Exodus,34,2,"Be ready tomorrow morning, and come up Mount Sinai to meet me there at the top."
Exodus,34,3,No one is to come up with you; no one is to be seen on any part of the mountain; and no sheep or cattle are to graze at the foot of the mountain.”
Exodus,34,4,"So Moses cut two more stone tablets, and early the next morning he carried them up Mount Sinai, just as the LORD had commanded."
Exodus,34,5,"The LORD came down in a cloud, stood with him there, and pronounced his holy name, the LORD."
Exodus,34,6,"The LORD then passed in front of him and called out, “I, the LORD , am a God who is full of compassion and pity, who is not easily angered and who shows great love and faithfulness."
Exodus,34,7,I keep my promise for thousands of generations and forgive evil and sin; but I will not fail to punish children and grandchildren to the third and fourth generation for the sins of their parents.”
Exodus,34,8,Moses quickly bowed down to the ground and worshipped.
Exodus,34,9,"He said, “Lord, if you really are pleased with me, I ask you to go with us. These people are stubborn, but forgive our evil and our sin, and accept us as your own people.”"
Exodus,34,10,"The LORD said to Moses, “I now make a covenant with the people of Israel. In their presence I will do great things such as have never been done anywhere on earth among any of the nations. All the people will see what great things I, the LORD , can do, because I am going to do an awesome thing for you."
Exodus,34,11,"Obey the laws that I am giving you today. I will drive out the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, as you advance."
Exodus,34,12,"Do not make any treaties with the people of the country into which you are going, because this could be a fatal trap for you."
Exodus,34,13,"Instead, tear down their altars, destroy their sacred pillars, and cut down the symbols of their goddess Asherah."
Exodus,34,14,"“Do not worship any other god, because I, the LORD , tolerate no rivals."
Exodus,34,15,"Do not make any treaties with the people of the country, because when they worship their pagan gods and sacrifice to them, they will invite you to join them, and you will be tempted to eat the food they offer to their gods."
Exodus,34,16,"Your sons might marry those foreign women, who would lead them to be unfaithful to me and to worship their pagan gods."
Exodus,34,17, “Do not make and worship gods of metal.
Exodus,34,18," “Keep the Festival of Unleavened Bread. As I have commanded you, eat unleavened bread for seven days in the month of Abib, because it was in that month that you left Egypt."
Exodus,34,19," “Every firstborn son and firstborn male domestic animal belongs to me,"
Exodus,34,20,"but you are to buy back every firstborn donkey by offering a lamb in its place. If you do not buy it back, break its neck. Buy back every firstborn son. “No one is to appear before me without an offering."
Exodus,34,21," “You have six days in which to do your work, but do not work on the seventh day, not even during ploughing time or harvest."
Exodus,34,22," “Keep the Harvest Festival when you begin to harvest the first crop of your wheat, and keep the Festival of Shelters in the autumn when you gather your fruit."
Exodus,34,23,"“Three times a year all your men must come to worship me, the LORD , the God of Israel."
Exodus,34,24,"After I have driven out the nations before you and extended your territory, no one will try to conquer your country during the three festivals."
Exodus,34,25, “Do not offer bread made with yeast when you sacrifice an animal to me. Do not keep until the following morning any part of the animal killed at the Passover Festival.
Exodus,34,26, “Each year bring to the house of the LORD the first corn that you harvest. “Do not cook a young sheep or goat in its mother's milk.”
Exodus,34,27,"The LORD said to Moses, “Write these words down, because it is on the basis of these words that I am making a covenant with you and with Israel.”"
Exodus,34,28,"Moses stayed there with the LORD forty days and nights, eating and drinking nothing. He wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant — the Ten Commandments."
Exodus,34,29," When Moses went down from Mount Sinai carrying the Ten Commandments, his face was shining because he had been speaking with the LORD ; but he did not know it."
Exodus,34,30,"Aaron and all the people looked at Moses and saw that his face was shining, and they were afraid to go near him."
Exodus,34,31,"But Moses called them, and Aaron and all the leaders of the community went to him, and Moses spoke to them."
Exodus,34,32,"After that, all the people of Israel gathered round him, and Moses gave them all the laws that the LORD had given him on Mount Sinai."
Exodus,34,33,"When Moses had finished speaking to them, he covered his face with a veil."
Exodus,34,34,"Whenever Moses went into the Tent of the LORD 's presence to speak to the LORD , he took the veil off. When he came out, he would tell the people of Israel everything that he had been commanded to say,"
Exodus,34,35,and they would see that his face was shining. Then he would put the veil back on until the next time he went to speak to the LORD.
Exodus,35,1,"Moses called together the whole community of the people of Israel and said to them, “This is what the LORD has commanded you to do:"
Exodus,35,2,"You have six days in which to do your work, but the seventh day is to be sacred, a solemn day of rest dedicated to me, the LORD . Anyone who does any work on that day is to be put to death."
Exodus,35,3,Do not even light a fire in your homes on the Sabbath.”
Exodus,35,4,"Moses said to all the people of Israel, “This is what the LORD has commanded:"
Exodus,35,5,"Make an offering to the LORD . Everyone who wishes to do so is to bring an offering of gold, silver, or bronze;"
Exodus,35,6,"fine linen; blue, purple, and red wool; cloth made of goats' hair;"
Exodus,35,7,rams' skin dyed red; fine leather; acacia wood;
Exodus,35,8,oil for the lamps; spices for the anointing oil and for the sweet-smelling incense;
Exodus,35,9,carnelians and other jewels to be set in the High Priest's ephod and in his breastpiece.
Exodus,35,10,“All the skilled workers among you are to come and make everything that the LORD commanded:
Exodus,35,11,"the Tent, its covering and its outer covering, its hooks and its frames, its crossbars, its posts, and its bases;"
Exodus,35,12,"the Covenant Box, its poles, its lid, and the curtain to screen it off;"
Exodus,35,13,"the table, its poles, and all its equipment; the bread offered to God;"
Exodus,35,14,the lampstand for the light and its equipment; the lamps with their oil;
Exodus,35,15,the altar for burning incense and its poles; the anointing oil; the sweet-smelling incense; the curtain for the entrance of the Tent;
Exodus,35,16,"the altar on which to burn offerings, with its bronze grating attached, its poles, and all its equipment; the washbasin and its base;"
Exodus,35,17,"the curtains for the enclosure, its posts and bases; the curtain for the entrance of the enclosure;"
Exodus,35,18,the pegs and ropes for the Tent and the enclosure;
Exodus,35,19,and the magnificent garments the priests are to wear when they serve in the Holy Place — the sacred clothes for Aaron the priest and for his sons.”
Exodus,35,20,"All the people of Israel left,"
Exodus,35,21,and everyone who wished to do so brought an offering to the LORD for making the Tent of the LORD 's presence. They brought everything needed for use in worship and for making the priestly garments.
Exodus,35,22,"All who wanted to, both men and women, brought decorative pins, earrings, rings, necklaces, and all kinds of gold jewellery and dedicated them to the LORD."
Exodus,35,23,"Everyone who had fine linen; blue, purple, or red wool; cloth of goats' hair; rams' skin dyed red; or fine leather, brought it."
Exodus,35,24,"All who were able to contribute silver or bronze brought their offering for the LORD , and all who had acacia wood which could be used for any of the work brought it."
Exodus,35,25,"All the skilled women brought fine linen thread and thread of blue, purple, and red wool, which they had made."
Exodus,35,26,They also made thread of goats' hair.
Exodus,35,27,The leaders brought carnelians and other jewels to be set in the ephod and the breastpiece
Exodus,35,28,"and spices and oil for the lamps, for the anointing oil, and for the sweet-smelling incense."
Exodus,35,29,All the people of Israel who wanted to brought their offering to the LORD for the work which he had commanded Moses to do.
Exodus,35,30,"Moses said to the Israelites, “The LORD has chosen Bezalel, the son of Uri and grandson of Hur, from the tribe of Judah."
Exodus,35,31,"God has filled him with his power and given him skill, ability, and understanding for every kind of artistic work,"
Exodus,35,32,"for planning skilful designs and working them in gold, silver and bronze;"
Exodus,35,33,for cutting jewels to be set; for carving wood; and for every other kind of artistic work.
Exodus,35,34,"The LORD has given to him and to Oholiab son of Ahisamach, from the tribe of Dan, the ability to teach their crafts to others."
Exodus,35,35,"He has given them skill in all kinds of work done by engravers, designers, and weavers of fine linen; blue, purple, and red wool; and other cloth. They are able to do all kinds of work and are skilful designers."
Exodus,36,1,"“Bezalel, Oholiab, and all the other workers to whom the LORD has given skill and understanding, who know how to make everything needed to build the sacred Tent, are to make everything just as the LORD has commanded.”"
Exodus,36,2,"Moses called Bezalel, Oholiab, and all the other skilled men to whom the LORD had given ability and who were willing to help, and Moses told them to start working."
Exodus,36,3,They received from him all the offerings which the Israelites had brought for constructing the sacred Tent. But the people of Israel continued to bring Moses their offerings every morning.
Exodus,36,4,Then the skilled men who were doing the work went
Exodus,36,5,"and reported to Moses, “The people are bringing more than is needed for the work which the LORD commanded to be done.”"
Exodus,36,6,So Moses sent a command throughout the camp that no one was to make any further contribution for the sacred Tent; so the people did not bring any more.
Exodus,36,7,What had already been brought was more than enough to finish all the work.
Exodus,36,8,"The most skilled men among those doing the work made the Tent of the LORD 's presence. They made it out of ten pieces of fine linen woven with blue, purple, and red wool and embroidered with figures of winged creatures."
Exodus,36,9,"Each piece was the same size, twelve metres long and two metres wide."
Exodus,36,10,They sewed five of them together in one set and did the same with the other five.
Exodus,36,11,They made loops of blue cloth on the edge of the outside piece in each set.
Exodus,36,12,They put fifty loops on the first piece of the first set and fifty loops matching them on the last piece of the second set.
Exodus,36,13,"They made fifty gold hooks, with which to join the two sets into one piece."

Exodus,36,20,They made upright frames of acacia wood for the Tent.
Exodus,36,21,"Each frame was four metres tall and 66 centimetres wide,"
Exodus,36,22,"with two matching projections, so that the frames could be joined together. All the frames had these projections."
Exodus,36,23,They made twenty frames for the south side
Exodus,36,24,"and forty silver bases to go under them, two bases under each frame to hold its two projections."
Exodus,36,25,They made twenty frames for the north side of the Tent
Exodus,36,26,"and forty silver bases, two under each frame."
Exodus,36,27,"For the back of the Tent, on the west, they made six frames"
Exodus,36,28,and two frames for the corners.
Exodus,36,29,These corner frames were joined at the bottom and connected all the way to the top. The two frames that formed the two corners were made in this way.
Exodus,36,30,"So there were eight frames and sixteen silver bases, two under each frame."
Exodus,36,31,"They made fifteen crossbars of acacia wood, five for the frames on one side of the Tent,"
Exodus,36,32,"five for the frames on the other side, and five for the frames on the west end, at the back."
