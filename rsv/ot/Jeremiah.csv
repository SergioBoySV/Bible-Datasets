Jeremiah,5,29,"Shall I not punish them for these things? says the Lord, and shall I not avenge myself on a nation such as this?”"

Jeremiah,6,19,"Hear, O earth; behold, I am bringing evil upon this people, the fruit of their devices, because they have not given heed to my words; and as for my law, they have rejected it."
Jeremiah,6,20,"To what purpose does frankincense come to me from Sheba, or sweet cane from a distant land? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices pleasing to me."

Jeremiah,7,4,"Do not trust in these deceptive words: ‘This is the temple of the Lord , the temple of the Lord , the temple of the Lord .’"
Jeremiah,7,5,"“For if you truly amend your ways and your doings, if you truly execute justice one with another,"
Jeremiah,7,6,"if you do not oppress the alien, the fatherless or the widow, or shed innocent blood in this place, and if you do not go after other gods to your own hurt,"
Jeremiah,7,7,"then I will let you dwell in this place, in the land that I gave of old to your fathers for ever."
Jeremiah,7,8,"“Behold, you trust in deceptive words to no avail."
Jeremiah,7,9,"Will you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, burn incense to Baal, and go after other gods that you have not known,"
Jeremiah,7,10,"and then come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, ‘We are delivered!’—only to go on doing all these abominations?"

Jeremiah,7,12,"Go now to my place that was in Shiloh, where I made my name dwell at first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel."
Jeremiah,7,13,"And now, because you have done all these things, says the Lord , and when I spoke to you persistently you did not listen, and when I called you, you did not answer,"
Jeremiah,7,14,"therefore I will do to the house which is called by my name, and in which you trust, and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I did to Shiloh."
Jeremiah,7,15,"And I will cast you out of my sight, as I cast out all your kinsmen, all the offspring of Ephraim."

Jeremiah,7,18,"The children gather wood, the fathers kindle fire, and the women knead dough, to make cakes for the queen of heaven; and they pour out drink offerings to other gods, to provoke me to anger."
Jeremiah,7,19,"Is it I whom they provoke? says the Lord . Is it not themselves, to their own confusion?"

Jeremiah,10,2,"Thus says the Lord: “Learn not the way of the nations, nor be dismayed at the signs of the heavens because the nations are dismayed at them,"

Jeremiah,11,1,The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord:
Jeremiah,11,2,"“Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,11,3,"You shall say to them, Thus says the Lord , the God of Israel: Cursed be the man who does not heed the words of this covenant"
Jeremiah,11,4,"which I commanded your fathers when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Listen to my voice, and do all that I command you. So shall you be my people, and I will be your God,"
Jeremiah,11,5,"that I may perform the oath which I swore to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as at this day.” Then I answered, “So be it, Lord .”"
Jeremiah,11,6,"And the Lord said to me, “Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: Hear the words of this covenant and do them."
Jeremiah,11,7,"For I solemnly warned your fathers when I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, warning them persistently, even to this day, saying, Obey my voice."
Jeremiah,11,8,"Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but every one walked in the stubbornness of his evil heart. Therefore I brought upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did not.”"
Jeremiah,11,9,"Again the Lord said to me, “There is revolt among the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,11,10,"They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words; they have gone after other gods to serve them; the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers."
Jeremiah,11,11,"Therefore, thus says the Lord , Behold, I am bringing evil upon them which they cannot escape; though they cry to me, I will not listen to them."
Jeremiah,11,12,"Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry to the gods to whom they burn incense, but they cannot save them in the time of their trouble."
Jeremiah,11,13,"For your gods have become as many as your cities, O Judah; and as many as the streets of Jerusalem are the altars you have set up to shame, altars to burn incense to Baal."
Jeremiah,11,14,"“Therefore do not pray for this people, or lift up a cry or prayer on their behalf, for I will not listen when they call to me in the time of their trouble."
Jeremiah,11,15,"What right has my beloved in my house, when she has done vile deeds? Can vows and sacrificial flesh avert your doom? Can you then exult?"

Jeremiah,11,17,"The Lord of hosts, who planted you, has pronounced evil against you, because of the evil which the house of Israel and the house of Judah have done, provoking me to anger by burning incense to Baal.”"
Jeremiah,11,18,The Lord made it known to me and I knew; then thou didst show me their evil deeds.
Jeremiah,11,19,"But I was like a gentle lamb led to the slaughter. I did not know it was against me they devised schemes, saying, “Let us destroy the tree with its fruit, let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name be remembered no more.”"
Jeremiah,11,20,"But, O Lord of hosts, who judgest righteously, who tries the heart and the mind, let me see thy vengeance upon them, for to thee have I committed my cause."
Jeremiah,11,21,"Therefore thus says the Lord concerning the men of Anathoth, who seek your life, and say, “Do not prophesy in the name of the Lord , or you will die by our hand” —"
Jeremiah,11,22,"therefore thus says the Lord of hosts: “Behold, I will punish them; the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine;"
Jeremiah,11,23,"and none of them shall be left. For I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, the year of their punishment.”"
Jeremiah,12,1,"Righteous art thou, O Lord, when I complain to thee; yet I would plead my case before thee. Why does the way of the wicked prosper? Why do all who are treacherous thrive?"
Jeremiah,12,2,"Thou plantest them, and they take root; they grow and bring forth fruit; thou art near in their mouth and far from their heart."
Jeremiah,12,3,"But thou, O Lord , knowest me; thou seest me, and triest my mind toward thee. Pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and set them apart for the day of slaughter."
Jeremiah,12,4,"How long will the land mourn, and the grass of every field wither? For the wickedness of those who dwell in it the beasts and the birds are swept away, because men said, “He will not see our latter end.”"
Jeremiah,12,5,"“If you have raced with men on foot, and they have wearied you, how will you compete with horses? And if in a safe land you fall down, how will you do in the jungle of the Jordan?"
Jeremiah,12,6,"For even your brothers and the house of your father, even they have dealt treacherously with you; they are in full cry after you; believe them not, though they speak fair words to you.”"
Jeremiah,12,7,"“I have forsaken my house, I have abandoned my heritage; I have given the beloved of my soul into the hands of her enemies."
Jeremiah,12,8,"My heritage has become to me like a lion in the forest, she has lifted up her voice against me; therefore I hate her."
Jeremiah,12,9,"Is my heritage to me like a speckled bird of prey? Are the birds of prey against her round about? Go, assemble all the wild beasts; bring them to devour."
Jeremiah,12,10,"Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard, they have trampled down my portion, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness."
Jeremiah,12,11,"They have made it a desolation; desolate, it mourns to me. The whole land is made desolate, but no man lays it to heart."
Jeremiah,12,12,Upon all the bare heights in the desert destroyers have come; for the sword of the Lord devours from one end of the land to the other; no flesh has peace.
Jeremiah,12,13,"They have sown wheat and have reaped thorns, they have tired themselves out but profit nothing. They shall be ashamed of their harvests because of the fierce anger of the Lord .”"
Jeremiah,12,14,"Thus says the Lord concerning all my evil neighbors who touch the heritage which I have given my people Israel to inherit: “Behold, I will pluck them up from their land, and I will pluck up the house of Judah from among them."
Jeremiah,12,15,"And after I have plucked them up, I will again have compassion on them, and I will bring them again each to his heritage and each to his land."
Jeremiah,12,16,"And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, ‘As the Lord lives,’ even as they taught my people to swear by Baal, then they shall be built up in the midst of my people."
Jeremiah,12,17,"But if any nation will not listen, then I will utterly pluck it up and destroy it, says the Lord .”"
Jeremiah,13,1,"Thus says the Lord to me, “Go and buy a linen waistcloth, and put it on your loins, and do not dip it in water.”"
Jeremiah,13,2,"So I bought a waistcloth according to the word of the Lord , and put it on my loins."
Jeremiah,13,3,"And the word of the Lord came to me a second time,"
Jeremiah,13,4,"“Take the waistcloth which you have bought, which is upon your loins, and arise, go to the Euphrates, and hide it there in a cleft of the rock.”"
Jeremiah,13,5,"So I went, and hid it by the Euphrates, as the Lord commanded me."
Jeremiah,13,6,"And after many days the Lord said to me, “Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take from there the waistcloth which I commanded you to hide there.”"
Jeremiah,13,7,"Then I went to the Euphrates, and dug, and I took the waistcloth from the place where I had hidden it. And behold, the waistcloth was spoiled; it was good for nothing."
Jeremiah,13,8,Then the word of the Lord came to me:
Jeremiah,13,9,“Thus says the Lord : Even so will I spoil the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah,13,10,"This evil people, who refuse to hear my words, who stubbornly follow their own heart and have gone after other gods to serve them and worship them, shall be like this waistcloth, which is good for nothing."
Jeremiah,13,11,"For as the waistcloth clings to the loins of a man, so I made the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah cling to me, says the Lord , that they might be for me a people, a name, a praise, and a glory, but they would not listen."
Jeremiah,13,12,"“You shall speak to them this word: ‘Thus says the Lord , the God of Israel, “Every jar shall be filled with wine.” ’ And they will say to you, ‘Do we not indeed know that every jar will be filled with wine?’"
Jeremiah,13,13,"Then you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord : Behold, I will fill with drunkenness all the inhabitants of this land: the kings who sit on David's throne, the priests, the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,13,14,"And I will dash them one against another, fathers and sons together, says the Lord . I will not pity or spare or have compassion, that I should not destroy them.’ ”"
Jeremiah,13,15,"Hear and give ear; be not proud, for the Lord has spoken."
Jeremiah,13,16,"Give glory to the Lord your God before he brings darkness, before your feet stumble on the twilight mountains, and while you look for light he turns it into gloom and makes it deep darkness."
Jeremiah,13,17,"But if you will not listen, my soul will weep in secret for your pride; my eyes will weep bitterly and run down with tears, because the Lord 's flock has been taken captive."
Jeremiah,13,18,"Say to the king and the queen mother: “Take a lowly seat, for your beautiful crown has come down from your head.”"
Jeremiah,13,19,"The cities of the Negeb are shut up, with none to open them; all Judah is taken into exile, wholly taken into exile."
Jeremiah,13,20,"“Lift up your eyes and see those who come from the north. Where is the flock that was given you, your beautiful flock?"
Jeremiah,13,21,"What will you say when they set as head over you those whom you yourself have taught to be friends to you? Will not pangs take hold of you, like those of a woman in travail?"
Jeremiah,13,22,"And if you say in your heart, ‘Why have these things come upon me?’ it is for the greatness of your iniquity that your skirts are lifted up, and you suffer violence."
Jeremiah,13,23,Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots? Then also you can do good who are accustomed to do evil.
Jeremiah,13,24,I will scatter you like chaff driven by the wind from the desert.
Jeremiah,13,25,"This is your lot, the portion I have measured out to you, says the Lord, because you have forgotten me and trusted in lies."
Jeremiah,13,26,"I myself will lift up your skirts over your face, and your shame will be seen."
Jeremiah,13,27,"I have seen your abominations, your adulteries and neighings, your lewd harlotries, on the hills in the field. Woe to you, O Jerusalem! How long will it be before you are made clean?”"

Jeremiah,14,2,"“Judah mourns and her gates languish; her people lament on the ground, and the cry of Jerusalem goes up."
Jeremiah,14,3,"Her nobles send their servants for water; they come to the cisterns, they find no water, they return with their vessels empty; they are ashamed and confounded and cover their heads."
Jeremiah,14,4,"Because of the ground which is dismayed, since there is no rain on the land, the farmers are ashamed, they cover their heads."
Jeremiah,14,5,Even the hind in the field forsakes her newborn calf because there is no grass.
Jeremiah,14,6,"The wild asses stand on the bare heights, they pant for air like jackals; their eyes fail because there is no herbage."

Jeremiah,14,8,"O thou hope of Israel, its savior in time of trouble, why shouldst thou be like a stranger in the land, like a wayfarer who turns aside to tarry for a night?"
Jeremiah,14,9,"Why shouldst thou be like a man confused, like a mighty man who cannot save? Yet thou, O Lord , art in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name; leave us not.”"
Jeremiah,14,10,"Thus says the Lord concerning this people: “They have loved to wander thus, they have not restrained their feet; therefore the Lord does not accept them now he will remember their iniquity and punish their sins.”"
Jeremiah,14,11,The Lord said to me: “Do not pray for the welfare of this people.
Jeremiah,14,12,"Though they fast, I will not hear their cry, and though they offer burnt offering and cereal offering, I will not accept them; but I will consume them by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence.”"
Jeremiah,14,13,"Then I said: “Ah, Lord God , behold, the prophets say to them, ‘You shall not see the sword, nor shall you have famine, but I will give you assured peace in this place.’ ”"
Jeremiah,14,14,"And the Lord said to me: “The prophets are prophesying lies in my name; I did not send them, nor did I command them or speak to them. They are prophesying to you a lying vision, worthless divination, and the deceit of their own minds."
Jeremiah,14,15,"Therefore thus says the Lord concerning the prophets who prophesy in my name although I did not send them, and who say, ‘Sword and famine shall not come on this land’: By sword and famine those prophets shall be consumed."
Jeremiah,14,16,"And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem, victims of famine and sword, with none to bury them—them, their wives, their sons, and their daughters. For I will pour out their wickedness upon them."
Jeremiah,14,17,"“You shall say to them this word: ‘Let my eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease, for the virgin daughter of my people is smitten with a great wound, with a very grievous blow."
Jeremiah,14,18,"If I go out into the field, behold, those slain by the sword! And if I enter the city, behold, the diseases of famine! For both prophet and priest ply their trade through the land, and have no knowledge.’ ”"
Jeremiah,14,19,"Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? Does thy soul loathe Zion? Why hast thou smitten us so that there is no healing for us? We looked for peace, but no good came; for a time of healing, but behold, terror."
Jeremiah,14,20,"We acknowledge our wickedness, O Lord, and the iniquity of our fathers, for we have sinned against thee."

Jeremiah,15,1,"Then the Lord said to me, “Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my heart would not turn toward this people. Send them out of my sight, and let them go!"
Jeremiah,15,2,"And when they ask you, ‘Where shall we go?’ you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord: “Those who are for pestilence, to pestilence, and those who are for the sword, to the sword; those who are for famine, to famine, and those who are for captivity, to captivity.” ’"

Jeremiah,16,3,"For thus says the Lord concerning the sons and daughters who are born in this place, and concerning the mothers who bore them and the fathers who begot them in this land:"
Jeremiah,16,4,"They shall die of deadly diseases. They shall not be lamented, nor shall they be buried; they shall be as dung on the surface of the ground. They shall perish by the sword and by famine, and their dead bodies shall be food for the birds of the air and for the beasts of the earth."

Jeremiah,16,10,"“And when you tell this people all these words, and they say to you, ‘Why has the Lord pronounced all this great evil against us? What is our iniquity? What is the sin that we have committed against the Lord our God?’"
Jeremiah,16,11,"then you shall say to them: ‘Because your fathers have forsaken me, says the Lord , and have gone after other gods and have served and worshiped them, and have forsaken me and have not kept my law,"
Jeremiah,16,12,"and because you have done worse than your fathers, for behold, every one of you follows his stubborn evil will, refusing to listen to me;"

Jeremiah,16,14,"“Therefore, behold, the days are coming, says the Lord , when it shall no longer be said, ‘As the Lord lives who brought up the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt,’"

Jeremiah,17,24,"“ ‘But if you listen to me, says the Lord , and bring in no burden by the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but keep the sabbath day holy and do no work on it,"

Jeremiah,18,1,The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord:
Jeremiah,18,2,"“Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will let you hear my words.”"
Jeremiah,18,3,"So I went down to the potter's house, and there he was working at his wheel."
Jeremiah,18,4,"And the vessel he was making of clay was spoiled in the potter's hand, and he reworked it into another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to do."
Jeremiah,18,5,Then the word of the Lord came to me:
Jeremiah,18,6,"“O house of Israel, can I not do with you as this potter has done? says the Lord . Behold, like the clay in the potter's hand, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel."
Jeremiah,18,7,"If at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom, that I will pluck up and break down and destroy it,"
Jeremiah,18,8,"and if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turns from its evil, I will repent of the evil that I intended to do to it."
Jeremiah,18,9,"And if at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom that I will build and plant it,"
Jeremiah,18,10,"and if it does evil in my sight, not listening to my voice, then I will repent of the good which I had intended to do to it."
Jeremiah,18,11,"Now, therefore, say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: ‘Thus says the Lord , Behold, I am shaping evil against you and devising a plan against you. Return, every one from his evil way, and amend your ways and your doings.’"
Jeremiah,18,12,"“But they say, ‘That is in vain! We will follow our own plans, and will every one act according to the stubbornness of his evil heart.’"
Jeremiah,18,13,"“Therefore thus says the Lord: Ask among the nations, who has heard the like of this? The virgin Israel has done a very horrible thing."
Jeremiah,18,14,"Does the snow of Lebanon leave the crags of Sirion? Do the mountain waters run dry, the cold flowing streams?"
Jeremiah,18,15,"But my people have forgotten me, they burn incense to false gods; they have stumbled in their ways, in the ancient roads, and have gone into bypaths, not the highway,"
Jeremiah,18,16,"making their land a horror, a thing to be hissed at for ever. Every one who passes by it is horrified and shakes his head."
Jeremiah,18,17,"Like the east wind I will scatter them before the enemy. I will show them my back, not my face, in the day of their calamity.”"
Jeremiah,18,18,"Then they said, “Come, let us make plots against Jeremiah, for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not heed any of his words.”"
Jeremiah,18,19,"Give heed to me, O Lord, and hearken to my plea."
Jeremiah,18,20,"Is evil a recompense for good? Yet they have dug a pit for my life. Remember how I stood before thee to speak good for them, to turn away thy wrath from them."
Jeremiah,18,21,"Therefore deliver up their children to famine; give them over to the power of the sword, let their wives become childless and widowed. May their men meet death by pestilence, their youths be slain by the sword in battle."
Jeremiah,18,22,"May a cry be heard from their houses, when thou bringest the marauder suddenly upon them! For they have dug a pit to take me, and laid snares for my feet."
Jeremiah,18,23,"Yet, thou, O Lord , knowest all their plotting to slay me. Forgive not their iniquity, nor blot out their sin from thy sight. Let them be overthrown before thee; deal with them in the time of thine anger."
Jeremiah,19,1,"Thus said the Lord , “Go, buy a potter's earthen flask, and take some of the elders of the people and some of the senior priests,"
Jeremiah,19,2,"and go out to the valley of the son of Hinnom at the entry of the Potsherd Gate, and proclaim there the words that I tell you."
Jeremiah,19,3,"You shall say, ‘Hear the word of the Lord , O kings of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem. Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I am bringing such evil upon this place that the ears of every one who hears of it will tingle."
Jeremiah,19,4,"Because the people have forsaken me, and have profaned this place by burning incense in it to other gods whom neither they nor their fathers nor the kings of Judah have known; and because they have filled this place with the blood of innocents,"
Jeremiah,19,5,"and have built the high places of Baal to burn their sons in the fire as burnt offerings to Baal, which I did not command or decree, nor did it come into my mind;"
Jeremiah,19,6,"therefore, behold, days are coming, says the Lord , when this place shall no more be called Topheth, or the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of Slaughter."
Jeremiah,19,7,"And in this place I will make void the plans of Judah and Jerusalem, and will cause their people to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hand of those who seek their life. I will give their dead bodies for food to the birds of the air and to the beasts of the earth."
Jeremiah,19,8,"And I will make this city a horror, a thing to be hissed at; every one who passes by it will be horrified and will hiss because of all its disasters."
Jeremiah,19,9,"And I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and their daughters, and every one shall eat the flesh of his neighbor in the siege and in the distress, with which their enemies and those who seek their life afflict them.’"
Jeremiah,19,10,"“Then you shall break the flask in the sight of the men who go with you,"
Jeremiah,19,11,"and shall say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts: So will I break this people and this city, as one breaks a potter's vessel, so that it can never be mended. Men shall bury in Topheth because there will be no place else to bury."
Jeremiah,19,12,"Thus will I do to this place, says the Lord , and to its inhabitants, making this city like Topheth."
Jeremiah,19,13,"The houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah—all the houses upon whose roofs incense has been burned to all the host of heaven, and drink offerings have been poured out to other gods—shall be defiled like the place of Topheth.’ ”"
Jeremiah,19,14,"Then Jeremiah came from Topheth, where the Lord had sent him to prophesy, and he stood in the court of the Lord 's house, and said to all the people:"
Jeremiah,19,15,"“Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I am bringing upon this city and upon all its towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it, because they have stiffened their neck, refusing to hear my words.”"
Jeremiah,20,1,"Now Pashhur the priest, the son of Immer, who was chief officer in the house of the Lord , heard Jeremiah prophesying these things."
Jeremiah,20,2,"Then Pashhur beat Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the upper Benjamin Gate of the house of the Lord."
Jeremiah,20,3,"On the morrow, when Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks, Jeremiah said to him, “The Lord does not call your name Pashhur, but Terror on every side."
Jeremiah,20,4,"For thus says the Lord : Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends. They shall fall by the sword of their enemies while you look on. And I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon; he shall carry them captive to Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword."
Jeremiah,20,5,"Moreover, I will give all the wealth of the city, all its gains, all its prized belongings, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah into the hand of their enemies, who shall plunder them, and seize them, and carry them to Babylon."
Jeremiah,20,6,"And you, Pashhur, and all who dwell in your house, shall go into captivity; to Babylon you shall go; and there you shall die, and there you shall be buried, you and all your friends, to whom you have prophesied falsely.”"
Jeremiah,20,7,"O Lord , thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived; thou art stronger than I, and thou hast prevailed. I have become a laughingstock all the day; every one mocks me."
Jeremiah,20,8,"For whenever I speak, I cry out, I shout, “Violence and destruction!” For the word of the Lord has become for me a reproach and derision all day long."
Jeremiah,20,9,"If I say, “I will not mention him, or speak any more in his name,” there is in my heart as it were a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I am weary with holding it in, and I cannot."
Jeremiah,20,10,"For I hear many whispering. Terror is on every side! “Denounce him! Let us denounce him!” say all my familiar friends, watching for my fall. “Perhaps he will be deceived, then we can overcome him, and take our revenge on him.”"
Jeremiah,20,11,"But the Lord is with me as a dread warrior; therefore my persecutors will stumble, they will not overcome me. They will be greatly shamed, for they will not succeed. Their eternal dishonor will never be forgotten."
Jeremiah,20,12,"O Lord of hosts, who triest the righteous, who seest the heart and the mind, let me see thy vengeance upon them, for to thee have I committed my cause."
Jeremiah,20,13,Sing to the Lord; praise the Lord! For he has delivered the life of the needy from the hand of evildoers.
Jeremiah,20,14," Cursed be the day on which I was born! The day when my mother bore me, let it not be blessed!"
Jeremiah,20,15,"Cursed be the man who brought the news to my father, “A son is born to you,” making him very glad."
Jeremiah,20,16,"Let that man be like the cities which the Lord overthrew without pity; let him hear a cry in the morning and an alarm at noon,"
Jeremiah,20,17,"because he did not kill me in the womb; so my mother would have been my grave, and her womb for ever great."
Jeremiah,20,18,"Why did I come forth from the womb to see toil and sorrow, and spend my days in shame?"
Jeremiah,21,1,"This is the word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord , when King Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur the son of Malchiah and Zephaniah the priest, the son of Ma-aseiah, saying,"
Jeremiah,21,2,"“Inquire of the Lord for us, for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon is making war against us; perhaps the Lord will deal with us according to all his wonderful deeds, and will make him withdraw from us.”"
Jeremiah,21,3,Then Jeremiah said to them:
Jeremiah,21,4,"“Thus you shall say to Zedekiah, ‘Thus says the Lord , the God of Israel: Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war which are in your hands and with which you are fighting against the king of Babylon and against the Chaldeans who are besieging you outside the walls; and I will bring them together into the midst of this city."
Jeremiah,21,5,"I myself will fight against you with outstretched hand and strong arm, in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath."
Jeremiah,21,6,"And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast; they shall die of a great pestilence."
Jeremiah,21,7,"Afterward, says the Lord , I will give Zedekiah king of Judah, and his servants, and the people in this city who survive the pestilence, sword, and famine, into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and into the hand of their enemies, into the hand of those who seek their lives. He shall smite them with the edge of the sword; he shall not pity them, or spare them, or have compassion.’"
Jeremiah,21,8,"“And to this people you shall say: ‘Thus says the Lord : Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death."
Jeremiah,21,9,"He who stays in this city shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence; but he who goes out and surrenders to the Chaldeans who are besieging you shall live and shall have his life as a prize of war."
Jeremiah,21,10,"For I have set my face against this city for evil and not for good, says the Lord : it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.’"
Jeremiah,21,11,"“And to the house of the king of Judah say, ‘Hear the word of the Lord,"
Jeremiah,21,12,"O house of David! Thus says the Lord: “ ‘Execute justice in the morning, and deliver from the hand of the oppressor him who has been robbed, lest my wrath go forth like fire, and burn with none to quench it, because of your evil doings.’ ”"
Jeremiah,21,13,"“Behold, I am against you, O inhabitant of the valley, O rock of the plain, says the Lord; you who say, ‘Who shall come down against us, or who shall enter our habitations?’"
Jeremiah,21,14,"I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, says the Lord; I will kindle a fire in her forest, and it shall devour all that is round about her.”"
Jeremiah,22,1,"Thus says the Lord : “Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word,"
Jeremiah,22,2,"and say, ‘Hear the word of the Lord , O King of Judah, who sit on the throne of David, you, and your servants, and your people who enter these gates."
Jeremiah,22,3,"Thus says the Lord : Do justice and righteousness, and deliver from the hand of the oppressor him who has been robbed. And do no wrong or violence to the alien, the fatherless, and the widow, nor shed innocent blood in this place."
Jeremiah,22,4,"For if you will indeed obey this word, then there shall enter the gates of this house kings who sit on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their servants, and their people."
Jeremiah,22,5,"But if you will not heed these words, I swear by myself, says the Lord , that this house shall become a desolation."
Jeremiah,22,6,"For thus says the Lord concerning the house of the king of Judah: “ ‘You are as Gilead to me, as the summit of Lebanon, yet surely I will make you a desert, an uninhabited city."
Jeremiah,22,7,"I will prepare destroyers against you, each with his weapons; and they shall cut down your choicest cedars, and cast them into the fire."
Jeremiah,22,8,"“ ‘And many nations will pass by this city, and every man will say to his neighbor, “Why has the Lord dealt thus with this great city?”"
Jeremiah,22,9,"And they will answer, “Because they forsook the covenant of the Lord their God, and worshiped other gods and served them.” ’ ”"
Jeremiah,22,10,"Weep not for him who is dead, nor bemoan him; but weep bitterly for him who goes away, for he shall return no more to see his native land."
Jeremiah,22,11,"For thus says the Lord concerning Shallum the son of Josiah, king of Judah, who reigned instead of Josiah his father, and who went away from this place: “He shall return here no more,"
Jeremiah,22,12,"but in the place where they have carried him captive, there shall he die, and he shall never see this land again.”"
Jeremiah,22,13,"“Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness, and his upper rooms by injustice; who makes his neighbor serve him for nothing, and does not give him his wages;"
Jeremiah,22,14,"who says, ‘I will build myself a great house with spacious upper rooms,’ and cuts out windows for it, paneling it with cedar, and painting it with vermilion."
Jeremiah,22,15,Do you think you are a king because you compete in cedar? Did not your father eat and drink and do justice and righteousness? Then it was well with him.
Jeremiah,22,16,He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well. Is not this to know me? says the Lord.
Jeremiah,22,17,"But you have eyes and heart only for your dishonest gain, for shedding innocent blood, and for practicing oppression and violence.”"
Jeremiah,22,18,"Therefore thus says the Lord concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah: “They shall not lament for him, saying, ‘Ah my brother!’ or ‘Ah sister!’ They shall not lament for him, saying, ‘Ah lord!’ or ‘Ah his majesty!’"
Jeremiah,22,19,"With the burial of an ass he shall be buried, dragged and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.”"
Jeremiah,22,20,"“Go up to Lebanon, and cry out, and lift up your voice in Bashan; cry from Abarim, for all your lovers are destroyed."
Jeremiah,22,21,"I spoke to you in your prosperity, but you said, ‘I will not listen.’ This has been your way from your youth, that you have not obeyed my voice."
Jeremiah,22,22,"The wind shall shepherd all your shepherds, and your lovers shall go into captivity; then you will be ashamed and confounded because of all your wickedness."
Jeremiah,22,23,"O inhabitant of Lebanon, nested among the cedars, how you will groan when pangs come upon you, pain as of a woman in travail!”"
Jeremiah,22,24,"“As I live, says the Lord , though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, were the signet ring on my right hand, yet I would tear you off"
Jeremiah,22,25,"and give you into the hand of those who seek your life, into the hand of those of whom you are afraid, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and into the hand of the Chaldeans."
Jeremiah,22,26,"I will hurl you and the mother who bore you into another country, where you were not born, and there you shall die."
Jeremiah,22,27,"But to the land to which they will long to return, there they shall not return.”"
Jeremiah,22,28,"Is this man Coniah a despised, broken pot, a vessel no one cares for? Why are he and his children hurled and cast into a land which they do not know?"
Jeremiah,22,29,"O land, land, land, hear the word of the Lord!"
Jeremiah,22,30,"Thus says the Lord: “Write this man down as childless, a man who shall not succeed in his days; for none of his offspring shall succeed in sitting on the throne of David, and ruling again in Judah.”"
Jeremiah,23,1,“Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture!” says the Lord.
Jeremiah,23,2,"Therefore thus says the Lord , the God of Israel, concerning the shepherds who care for my people: “You have scattered my flock, and have driven them away, and you have not attended to them. Behold, I will attend to you for your evil doings, says the Lord."
Jeremiah,23,3,"Then I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them, and I will bring them back to their fold, and they shall be fruitful and multiply."
Jeremiah,23,4,"I will set shepherds over them who will care for them, and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall any be missing, says the Lord."
Jeremiah,23,5," “Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord , when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land."
Jeremiah,23,6,"In his days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell securely. And this is the name by which he will be called: ‘The Lord is our righteousness.’"
Jeremiah,23,7,"“Therefore, behold, the days are coming, says the Lord , when men shall no longer say, ‘As the Lord lives who brought up the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt,’"
Jeremiah,23,8,but ‘As the Lord lives who brought up and led the descendants of the house of Israel out of the north country and out of all the countries where he had driven them.’ Then they shall dwell in their own land.”
Jeremiah,23,9,"Concerning the prophets: My heart is broken within me, all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, like a man overcome by wine, because of the Lord and because of his holy words."
Jeremiah,23,10,"For the land is full of adulterers; because of the curse the land mourns, and the pastures of the wilderness are dried up. Their course is evil, and their might is not right."
Jeremiah,23,11,"“Both prophet and priest are ungodly; even in my house I have found their wickedness, says the Lord."
Jeremiah,23,12,"Therefore their way shall be to them like slippery paths in the darkness, into which they shall be driven and fall; for I will bring evil upon them in the year of their punishment, says the Lord."
Jeremiah,23,13,In the prophets of Samaria I saw an unsavory thing: they prophesied by Baal and led my people Israel astray.
Jeremiah,23,14,"But in the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a horrible thing: they commit adultery and walk in lies; they strengthen the hands of evildoers, so that no one turns from his wickedness; all of them have become like Sodom to me, and its inhabitants like Gomorrah.”"
Jeremiah,23,15,"Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts concerning the prophets: “Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and give them poisoned water to drink; for from the prophets of Jerusalem ungodliness has gone forth into all the land.”"
Jeremiah,23,16,"Thus says the Lord of hosts: “Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you, filling you with vain hopes; they speak visions of their own minds, not from the mouth of the Lord."
Jeremiah,23,17,"They say continually to those who despise the word of the Lord , ‘It shall be well with you’; and to every one who stubbornly follows his own heart, they say, ‘No evil shall come upon you.’ ”"
Jeremiah,23,18,"For who among them has stood in the council of the Lord to perceive and to hear his word, or who has given heed to his word and listened?"
Jeremiah,23,19,"Behold, the storm of the Lord! Wrath has gone forth, a whirling tempest; it will burst upon the head of the wicked."
Jeremiah,23,20,The anger of the Lord will not turn back until he has executed and accomplished the intents of his mind. In the latter days you will understand it clearly.
Jeremiah,23,21,"“I did not send the prophets, yet they ran; I did not speak to them, yet they prophesied."
Jeremiah,23,22,"But if they had stood in my council, then they would have proclaimed my words to my people, and they would have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings."
Jeremiah,23,23,"“Am I a God at hand, says the Lord , and not a God afar off?"
Jeremiah,23,24,Can a man hide himself in secret places so that I cannot see him? says the Lord . Do I not fill heaven and earth? says the Lord.
Jeremiah,23,25,"I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy lies in my name, saying, ‘I have dreamed, I have dreamed!’"
Jeremiah,23,26,"How long shall there be lies in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies, and who prophesy the deceit of their own heart,"
Jeremiah,23,27,"who think to make my people forget my name by their dreams which they tell one another, even as their fathers forgot my name for Baal?"
Jeremiah,23,28,"Let the prophet who has a dream tell the dream, but let him who has my word speak my word faithfully. What has straw in common with wheat? says the Lord."
Jeremiah,23,29,"Is not my word like fire, says the Lord , and like a hammer which breaks the rock in pieces?"
Jeremiah,23,30,"Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, says the Lord , who steal my words from one another."
Jeremiah,23,31,"Behold, I am against the prophets, says the Lord , who use their tongues and say, ‘Says the Lord .’"
Jeremiah,23,32,"Behold, I am against those who prophesy lying dreams, says the Lord , and who tell them and lead my people astray by their lies and their recklessness, when I did not send them or charge them; so they do not profit this people at all, says the Lord."
Jeremiah,23,33,"“When one of this people, or a prophet, or a priest asks you, ‘What is the burden of the Lord ?’ you shall say to them, ‘You are the burden, and I will cast you off, says the Lord .’"
Jeremiah,23,34,"And as for the prophet, priest, or one of the people who says, ‘The burden of the Lord ,’ I will punish that man and his household."
Jeremiah,23,35,"Thus shall you say, every one to his neighbor and every one to his brother, ‘What has the Lord answered?’ or ‘What has the Lord spoken?’"
Jeremiah,23,36,"But ‘the burden of the Lord ’ you shall mention no more, for the burden is every man's own word, and you pervert the words of the living God, the Lord of hosts, our God."
Jeremiah,23,37,"Thus you shall say to the prophet, ‘What has the Lord answered you?’ or ‘What has the Lord spoken?’"
Jeremiah,23,38,"But if you say, ‘The burden of the Lord ,’ thus says the Lord , ‘Because you have said these words, “The burden of the Lord ,” when I sent to you, saying, “You shall not say, ‘The burden of the Lord ,’ ”"
Jeremiah,23,39,"therefore, behold, I will surely lift you up and cast you away from my presence, you and the city which I gave to you and your fathers."
Jeremiah,23,40,"And I will bring upon you everlasting reproach and perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.’ ”"
Jeremiah,24,1,"After Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had taken into exile from Jerusalem Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, together with the princes of Judah, the craftsmen, and the smiths, and had brought them to Babylon, the Lord showed me this vision: Behold, two baskets of figs placed before the temple of the Lord."
Jeremiah,24,2,"One basket had very good figs, like first-ripe figs, but the other basket had very bad figs, so bad that they could not be eaten."
Jeremiah,24,3,"And the Lord said to me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?” I said, “Figs, the good figs very good, and the bad figs very bad, so bad that they cannot be eaten.”"
Jeremiah,24,4,Then the word of the Lord came to me:
Jeremiah,24,5,"“Thus says the Lord , the God of Israel: Like these good figs, so I will regard as good the exiles from Judah, whom I have sent away from this place to the land of the Chaldeans."
Jeremiah,24,6,"I will set my eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them back to this land. I will build them up, and not tear them down; I will plant them, and not uproot them."
Jeremiah,24,7,"I will give them a heart to know that I am the Lord ; and they shall be my people and I will be their God, for they shall return to me with their whole heart."
Jeremiah,24,8,"“But thus says the Lord : Like the bad figs which are so bad they cannot be eaten, so will I treat Zedekiah the king of Judah, his princes, the remnant of Jerusalem who remain in this land, and those who dwell in the land of Egypt."
Jeremiah,24,9,"I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a reproach, a byword, a taunt, and a curse in all the places where I shall drive them."
Jeremiah,24,10,"And I will send sword, famine, and pestilence upon them, until they shall be utterly destroyed from the land which I gave to them and their fathers.”"
Jeremiah,25,1,"The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah (that was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon),"
Jeremiah,25,2,which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem:
Jeremiah,25,3,"“For twenty-three years, from the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, to this day, the word of the Lord has come to me, and I have spoken persistently to you, but you have not listened."
Jeremiah,25,4,"You have neither listened nor inclined your ears to hear, although the Lord persistently sent to you all his servants the prophets,"
Jeremiah,25,5,"saying, ‘Turn now, every one of you, from his evil way and wrong doings, and dwell upon the land which the Lord has given to you and your fathers from of old and for ever;"
Jeremiah,25,6,"do not go after other gods to serve and worship them, or provoke me to anger with the work of your hands. Then I will do you no harm.’"
Jeremiah,25,7,"Yet you have not listened to me, says the Lord , that you might provoke me to anger with the work of your hands to your own harm."
Jeremiah,25,8,"“Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts: Because you have not obeyed my words,"
Jeremiah,25,9,"behold, I will send for all the tribes of the north, says the Lord , and for Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and I will bring them against this land and its inhabitants, and against all these nations round about; I will utterly destroy them, and make them a horror, a hissing, and an everlasting reproach."
Jeremiah,25,10,"Moreover, I will banish from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the grinding of the millstones and the light of the lamp."
Jeremiah,25,11,"This whole land shall become a ruin and a waste, and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years."
Jeremiah,25,12,"Then after seventy years are completed, I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation, the land of the Chaldeans, for their iniquity, says the Lord , making the land an everlasting waste."
Jeremiah,25,13,"I will bring upon that land all the words which I have uttered against it, everything written in this book, which Jeremiah prophesied against all the nations."
Jeremiah,25,14,For many nations and great kings shall make slaves even of them; and I will recompense them according to their deeds and the work of their hands.”
Jeremiah,25,15," Thus the Lord , the God of Israel, said to me: “Take from my hand this cup of the wine of wrath, and make all the nations to whom I send you drink it."
Jeremiah,25,16,They shall drink and stagger and be crazed because of the sword which I am sending among them.”
Jeremiah,25,17,"So I took the cup from the Lord 's hand, and made all the nations to whom the Lord sent me drink it:"
Jeremiah,25,18,"Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, its kings and princes, to make them a desolation and a waste, a hissing and a curse, as at this day;"
Jeremiah,25,19,"Pharaoh king of Egypt, his servants, his princes, all his people,"
Jeremiah,25,20,"and all the foreign folk among them; all the kings of the land of Uz and all the kings of the land of the Philistines (Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod);"
Jeremiah,25,21,"Edom, Moab, and the sons of Ammon;"
Jeremiah,25,22,"all the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the coastland across the sea;"
Jeremiah,25,23,"Dedan, Tema, Buz, and all who cut the corners of their hair;"
Jeremiah,25,24,all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the mixed tribes that dwell in the desert;
Jeremiah,25,25,"all the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of Media;"
Jeremiah,25,26,"all the kings of the north, far and near, one after another, and all the kingdoms of the world which are on the face of the earth. And after them the king of Babylon shall drink."
Jeremiah,25,27,"“Then you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Drink, be drunk and vomit, fall and rise no more, because of the sword which I am sending among you.’"
Jeremiah,25,28,"“And if they refuse to accept the cup from your hand to drink, then you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts: You must drink!"
Jeremiah,25,29,"For behold, I begin to work evil at the city which is called by my name, and shall you go unpunished? You shall not go unpunished, for I am summoning a sword against all the inhabitants of the earth, says the Lord of hosts.’"
Jeremiah,25,30,"“You, therefore, shall prophesy against them all these words, and say to them: ‘The Lord will roar from on high, and from his holy habitation utter his voice; he will roar mightily against his fold, and shout, like those who tread grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth."
Jeremiah,25,31,"The clamor will resound to the ends of the earth, for the Lord has an indictment against the nations; he is entering into judgment with all flesh, and the wicked he will put to the sword, says the Lord .’"
Jeremiah,25,32,"“Thus says the Lord of hosts: Behold, evil is going forth from nation to nation, and a great tempest is stirring from the farthest parts of the earth!"
Jeremiah,25,33,"“And those slain by the Lord on that day shall extend from one end of the earth to the other. They shall not be lamented, or gathered, or buried; they shall be dung on the surface of the ground."
Jeremiah,25,34,"“Wail, you shepherds, and cry, and roll in ashes, you lords of the flock, for the days of your slaughter and dispersion have come, and you shall fall like choice rams."
Jeremiah,25,35,"No refuge will remain for the shepherds, nor escape for the lords of the flock."
Jeremiah,25,36,"Hark, the cry of the shepherds, and the wail of the lords of the flock! For the Lord is despoiling their pasture,"
Jeremiah,25,37,"and the peaceful folds are devastated, because of the fierce anger of the Lord."
Jeremiah,25,38,"Like a lion he has left his covert, for their land has become a waste because of the sword of the oppressor, and because of his fierce anger.”"
Jeremiah,26,1,"In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came from the Lord,"
Jeremiah,26,2,"“Thus says the Lord : Stand in the court of the Lord 's house, and speak to all the cities of Judah which come to worship in the house of the Lord all the words that I command you to speak to them; do not hold back a word."
Jeremiah,26,3,"It may be they will listen, and every one turn from his evil way, that I may repent of the evil which I intend to do to them because of their evil doings."
Jeremiah,26,4,"You shall say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord : If you will not listen to me, to walk in my law which I have set before you,"
Jeremiah,26,5,"and to heed the words of my servants the prophets whom I send to you urgently, though you have not heeded,"
Jeremiah,26,6,"then I will make this house like Shiloh, and I will make this city a curse for all the nations of the earth.’ ”"
Jeremiah,26,7,The priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the Lord.
Jeremiah,26,8,"And when Jeremiah had finished speaking all that the Lord had commanded him to speak to all the people, then the priests and the prophets and all the people laid hold of him, saying, “You shall die!"
Jeremiah,26,9,"Why have you prophesied in the name of the Lord , saying, ‘This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate, without inhabitant’?” And all the people gathered about Jeremiah in the house of the Lord."
Jeremiah,26,10,"When the princes of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king's house to the house of the Lord and took their seat in the entry of the New Gate of the house of the Lord."
Jeremiah,26,11,"Then the priests and the prophets said to the princes and to all the people, “This man deserves the sentence of death, because he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your own ears.”"
Jeremiah,26,12,"Then Jeremiah spoke to all the princes and all the people, saying, “The Lord sent me to prophesy against this house and this city all the words you have heard."
Jeremiah,26,13,"Now therefore amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the Lord your God, and the Lord will repent of the evil which he has pronounced against you."
Jeremiah,26,14,"But as for me, behold, I am in your hands. Do with me as seems good and right to you."
Jeremiah,26,15,"Only know for certain that if you put me to death, you will bring innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city and its inhabitants, for in truth the Lord sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears.”"
Jeremiah,26,16,"Then the princes and all the people said to the priests and the prophets, “This man does not deserve the sentence of death, for he has spoken to us in the name of the Lord our God.”"
Jeremiah,26,17,"And certain of the elders of the land arose and spoke to all the assembled people, saying,"
Jeremiah,26,18,"“Micah of Moresheth prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and said to all the people of Judah: ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts, Zion shall be plowed as a field; Jerusalem shall become a heap of ruins, and the mountain of the house a wooded height.’"
Jeremiah,26,19,"Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? Did he not fear the Lord and entreat the favor of the Lord , and did not the Lord repent of the evil which he had pronounced against them? But we are about to bring great evil upon ourselves.”"
Jeremiah,26,20,"There was another man who prophesied in the name of the Lord , Uriah the son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-jearim. He prophesied against this city and against this land in words like those of Jeremiah."
Jeremiah,26,21,"And when King Jehoiakim, with all his warriors and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death; but when Uriah heard of it, he was afraid and fled and escaped to Egypt."
Jeremiah,26,22,"Then King Jehoiakim sent to Egypt certain men, Elnathan the son of Achbor and others with him,"
Jeremiah,26,23,"and they fetched Uriah from Egypt and brought him to King Jehoiakim, who slew him with the sword and cast his dead body into the burial place of the common people."
Jeremiah,26,24,But the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah so that he was not given over to the people to be put to death.
Jeremiah,27,1,"In the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord."
Jeremiah,27,2,"Thus the Lord said to me: “Make yourself thongs and yoke-bars, and put them on your neck."
Jeremiah,27,3,"Send word to the king of Edom, the king of Moab, the king of the sons of Ammon, the king of Tyre, and the king of Sidon by the hand of the envoys who have come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah."
Jeremiah,27,4,"Give them this charge for their masters: ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: This is what you shall say to your masters:"
Jeremiah,27,5,"“It is I who by my great power and my outstretched arm have made the earth, with the men and animals that are on the earth, and I give it to whomever it seems right to me."
Jeremiah,27,6,"Now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, my servant, and I have given him also the beasts of the field to serve him."
Jeremiah,27,7,"All the nations shall serve him and his son and his grandson, until the time of his own land comes; then many nations and great kings shall make him their slave."
Jeremiah,27,8,"“ ‘ “But if any nation or kingdom will not serve this Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, I will punish that nation with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence, says the Lord , until I have consumed it by his hand."
Jeremiah,27,9,"So do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your dreamers, your soothsayers, or your sorcerers, who are saying to you, ‘You shall not serve the king of Babylon.’"
Jeremiah,27,10,"For it is a lie which they are prophesying to you, with the result that you will be removed far from your land, and I will drive you out, and you will perish."
Jeremiah,27,11,"But any nation which will bring its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will leave on its own land, to till it and dwell there, says the Lord .” ’ ”"
Jeremiah,27,12,"To Zedekiah king of Judah I spoke in like manner: “Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live."
Jeremiah,27,13,"Why will you and your people die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence, as the Lord has spoken concerning any nation which will not serve the king of Babylon?"
Jeremiah,27,14,"Do not listen to the words of the prophets who are saying to you, ‘You shall not serve the king of Babylon,’ for it is a lie which they are prophesying to you."
Jeremiah,27,15,"I have not sent them, says the Lord , but they are prophesying falsely in my name, with the result that I will drive you out and you will perish, you and the prophets who are prophesying to you.”"
Jeremiah,27,16,"Then I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, “Thus says the Lord : Do not listen to the words of your prophets who are prophesying to you, saying, ‘Behold, the vessels of the Lord 's house will now shortly be brought back from Babylon,’ for it is a lie which they are prophesying to you."
Jeremiah,27,17,Do not listen to them; serve the king of Babylon and live. Why should this city become a desolation?
Jeremiah,27,18,"If they are prophets, and if the word of the Lord is with them, then let them intercede with the Lord of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of the Lord , in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem may not go to Babylon."
Jeremiah,27,19,"For thus says the Lord of hosts concerning the pillars, the sea, the stands, and the rest of the vessels which are left in this city,"
Jeremiah,27,20,"which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take away, when he took into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem—"
Jeremiah,27,21,"thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels which are left in the house of the Lord , in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem:"
Jeremiah,27,22,"They shall be carried to Babylon and remain there until the day when I give attention to them, says the Lord . Then I will bring them back and restore them to this place.”"
Jeremiah,28,1,"In that same year, at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fifth month of the fourth year, Hananiah the son of Azzur, the prophet from Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of the Lord , in the presence of the priests and all the people, saying,"
Jeremiah,28,2,"“Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon."
Jeremiah,28,3,"Within two years I will bring back to this place all the vessels of the Lord 's house, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place and carried to Babylon."
Jeremiah,28,4,"I will also bring back to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and all the exiles from Judah who went to Babylon, says the Lord , for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.”"
Jeremiah,28,5,Then the prophet Jeremiah spoke to Hananiah the prophet in the presence of the priests and all the people who were standing in the house of the Lord;
Jeremiah,28,6,"and the prophet Jeremiah said, “Amen! May the Lord do so; may the Lord make the words which you have prophesied come true, and bring back to this place from Babylon the vessels of the house of the Lord , and all the exiles."
Jeremiah,28,7,Yet hear now this word which I speak in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people.
Jeremiah,28,8,"The prophets who preceded you and me from ancient times prophesied war, famine, and pestilence against many countries and great kingdoms."
Jeremiah,28,9,"As for the prophet who prophesies peace, when the word of that prophet comes to pass, then it will be known that the Lord has truly sent the prophet.”"
Jeremiah,28,10,"Then the prophet Hananiah took the yoke-bars from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, and broke them."
Jeremiah,28,11,"And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, “Thus says the Lord : Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all the nations within two years.” But Jeremiah the prophet went his way."
Jeremiah,28,12,"Sometime after the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke-bars from off the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah:"
Jeremiah,28,13,"“Go, tell Hananiah, ‘Thus says the Lord : You have broken wooden bars, but I will make in their place bars of iron."
Jeremiah,28,14,"For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: I have put upon the neck of all these nations an iron yoke of servitude to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and they shall serve him, for I have given to him even the beasts of the field.’ ”"
Jeremiah,28,15,"And Jeremiah the prophet said to the prophet Hananiah, “Listen, Hananiah, the Lord has not sent you, and you have made this people trust in a lie."
Jeremiah,28,16,"Therefore thus says the Lord : ‘Behold, I will remove you from the face of the earth. This very year you shall die, because you have uttered rebellion against the Lord .’ ”"
Jeremiah,28,17,"In that same year, in the seventh month, the prophet Hananiah died."
Jeremiah,29,1,"These are the words of the letter which Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the elders of the exiles, and to the priests, the prophets, and all the people, whom Nebuchadnezzar had taken into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon."
Jeremiah,29,2,"This was after King Jeconiah, and the queen mother, the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the smiths had departed from Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,29,3,"The letter was sent by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. It said:"
Jeremiah,29,4,"“Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the exiles whom I have sent into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon:"
Jeremiah,29,5,Build houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat their produce.
Jeremiah,29,6,"Take wives and have sons and daughters; take wives for your sons, and give your daughters in marriage, that they may bear sons and daughters; multiply there, and do not decrease."
Jeremiah,29,7,"But seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the Lord on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare."
Jeremiah,29,8,"For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Do not let your prophets and your diviners who are among you deceive you, and do not listen to the dreams which they dream,"
Jeremiah,29,9,"for it is a lie which they are prophesying to you in my name; I did not send them, says the Lord."
Jeremiah,29,10,"“For thus says the Lord : When seventy years are completed for Babylon, I will visit you, and I will fulfil to you my promise and bring you back to this place."
Jeremiah,29,11,"For I know the plans I have for you, says the Lord , plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope."
Jeremiah,29,12,"Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will hear you."
Jeremiah,29,13,"You will seek me and find me; when you seek me with all your heart,"
Jeremiah,29,14,"I will be found by you, says the Lord , and I will restore your fortunes and gather you from all the nations and all the places where I have driven you, says the Lord , and I will bring you back to the place from which I sent you into exile."
Jeremiah,29,15,"“Because you have said, ‘The Lord has raised up prophets for us in Babylon,’ —"
Jeremiah,29,16,"Thus says the Lord concerning the king who sits on the throne of David, and concerning all the people who dwell in this city, your kinsmen who did not go out with you into exile:"
Jeremiah,29,17,"‘Thus says the Lord of hosts, Behold, I am sending on them sword, famine, and pestilence, and I will make them like vile figs which are so bad they cannot be eaten."
Jeremiah,29,18,"I will pursue them with sword, famine, and pestilence, and will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, a terror, a hissing, and a reproach among all the nations where I have driven them,"
Jeremiah,29,19,"because they did not heed my words, says the Lord , which I persistently sent to you by my servants the prophets, but you would not listen, says the Lord .’ —"
Jeremiah,29,20,"Hear the word of the Lord , all you exiles whom I sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon:"
Jeremiah,29,21,"‘Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah the son of Ma-aseiah, who are prophesying a lie to you in my name: Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall slay them before your eyes."
Jeremiah,29,22,"Because of them this curse shall be used by all the exiles from Judah in Babylon: “The Lord make you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire,”"
Jeremiah,29,23,"because they have committed folly in Israel, they have committed adultery with their neighbors' wives, and they have spoken in my name lying words which I did not command them. I am the one who knows, and I am witness, says the Lord .’ ”"
Jeremiah,29,24,To Shemaiah of Nehelam you shall say:
Jeremiah,29,25,"“Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: You have sent letters in your name to all the people who are in Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Ma-aseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,"
Jeremiah,29,26,"‘The Lord has made you priest instead of Jehoiada the priest, to have charge in the house of the Lord over every madman who prophesies, to put him in the stocks and collar."
Jeremiah,29,27,Now why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth who is prophesying to you?
Jeremiah,29,28,"For he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, “Your exile will be long; build houses and live in them, and plant gardens and eat their produce.” ’ ”"
Jeremiah,29,29,Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet.
Jeremiah,29,30,Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah:
Jeremiah,29,31,"“Send to all the exiles, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord concerning Shemaiah of Nehelam: Because Shemaiah had prophesied to you when I did not send him, and has made you trust in a lie,"
Jeremiah,29,32,"therefore thus says the Lord : Behold, I will punish Shemaiah of Nehelam and his descendants; he shall not have any one living among this people to see the good that I will do to my people, says the Lord , for he has talked rebellion against the Lord .’ ”"
Jeremiah,30,1,The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord:
Jeremiah,30,2,"“Thus says the Lord , the God of Israel: Write in a book all the words that I have spoken to you."
Jeremiah,30,3,"For behold, days are coming, says the Lord , when I will restore the fortunes of my people, Israel and Judah, says the Lord , and I will bring them back to the land which I gave to their fathers, and they shall take possession of it.”"
Jeremiah,30,4,These are the words which the Lord spoke concerning Israel and Judah:
Jeremiah,30,5,"“Thus says the Lord: We have heard a cry of panic, of terror, and no peace."
Jeremiah,30,6,"Ask now, and see, can a man bear a child? Why then do I see every man with his hands on his loins like a woman in labor? Why has every face turned pale?"
Jeremiah,30,7,Alas! that day is so great there is none like it; it is a time of distress for Jacob; yet he shall be saved out of it.
Jeremiah,30,8,"“And it shall come to pass in that day, says the Lord of hosts, that I will break the yoke from off their neck, and I will burst their bonds, and strangers shall no more make servants of them."

Jeremiah,32,3,"For Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him, saying, “Why do you prophesy and say, ‘Thus says the Lord : Behold, I am giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;"
Jeremiah,32,4,"Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him face to face and see him eye to eye;"

Jeremiah,32,7,"Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle will come to you and say, ‘Buy my field which is at Anathoth, for the right of redemption by purchase is yours.’"
Jeremiah,32,8,"Then Hanamel my cousin came to me in the court of the guard, in accordance with the word of the Lord , and said to me, ‘Buy my field which is at Anathoth in the land of Benjamin, for the right of possession and redemption is yours; buy it for yourself.’ Then I knew that this was the word of the Lord."
Jeremiah,32,9,"“And I bought the field at Anathoth from Hanamel my cousin, and weighed out the money to him, seventeen shekels of silver."
Jeremiah,32,10,"I signed the deed, sealed it, got witnesses, and weighed the money on scales."
Jeremiah,32,11,"Then I took the sealed deed of purchase, containing the terms and conditions, and the open copy;"
Jeremiah,32,12,"and I gave the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel my cousin, in the presence of the witnesses who signed the deed of purchase, and in the presence of all the Jews who were sitting in the court of the guard."
Jeremiah,32,13,"I charged Baruch in their presence, saying,"
Jeremiah,32,14,"‘Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, both this sealed deed of purchase and this open deed, and put them in an earthenware vessel, that they may last for a long time."
Jeremiah,32,15,"For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall again be bought in this land.’"
Jeremiah,32,16,"“After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed to the Lord , saying:"
Jeremiah,32,17,"‘Ah Lord God ! It is thou who hast made the heavens and the earth by thy great power and by thy outstretched arm! Nothing is too hard for thee,"
Jeremiah,32,18,"who showest steadfast love to thousands, but dost requite the guilt of fathers to their children after them, O great and mighty God whose name is the Lord of hosts,"
Jeremiah,32,19,"great in counsel and mighty in deed; whose eyes are open to all the ways of men, rewarding every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings;"
Jeremiah,32,20,"who hast shown signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, and to this day in Israel and among all mankind, and hast made thee a name, as at this day."
Jeremiah,32,21,"Thou didst bring thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand and outstretched arm, and with great terror;"
Jeremiah,32,22,"and thou gavest them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;"
Jeremiah,32,23,and they entered and took possession of it. But they did not obey thy voice or walk in thy law; they did nothing of all thou didst command them to do. Therefore thou hast made all this evil come upon them.
Jeremiah,32,24,"Behold, the siege mounds have come up to the city to take it, and because of sword and famine and pestilence the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans who are fighting against it. What thou didst speak has come to pass, and behold, thou seest it."
Jeremiah,32,25,"Yet thou, O Lord God , hast said to me, “Buy the field for money and get witnesses”—though the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans.’ ”"
Jeremiah,32,26,The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah:
Jeremiah,32,27,"“Behold, I am the Lord , the God of all flesh; is anything too hard for me?"
Jeremiah,32,28,"Therefore, thus says the Lord : Behold, I am giving this city into the hands of the Chaldeans and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it."
Jeremiah,32,29,"The Chaldeans who are fighting against this city shall come and set this city on fire, and burn it, with the houses on whose roofs incense has been offered to Baal and drink offerings have been poured out to other gods, to provoke me to anger."
Jeremiah,32,30,"For the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah have done nothing but evil in my sight from their youth; the sons of Israel have done nothing but provoke me to anger by the work of their hands, says the Lord."
Jeremiah,32,31,"This city has aroused my anger and wrath, from the day it was built to this day, so that I will remove it from my sight"
Jeremiah,32,32,"because of all the evil of the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah which they did to provoke me to anger—their kings and their princes, their priests and their prophets, the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,32,33,They have turned to me their back and not their face; and though I have taught them persistently they have not listened to receive instruction.
Jeremiah,32,34,"They set up their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it."
Jeremiah,32,35,"They built the high places of Baal in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to offer up their sons and daughters to Molech, though I did not command them, nor did it enter into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin."
Jeremiah,32,36,"“Now therefore thus says the Lord , the God of Israel, concerning this city of which you say, ‘It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by sword, by famine, and by pestilence’:"
Jeremiah,32,37,"Behold, I will gather them from all the countries to which I drove them in my anger and my wrath and in great indignation; I will bring them back to this place, and I will make them dwell in safety."
Jeremiah,32,38,"And they shall be my people, and I will be their God."
Jeremiah,32,39,"I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for their own good and the good of their children after them."
Jeremiah,32,40,"I will make with them an everlasting covenant, that I will not turn away from doing good to them; and I will put the fear of me in their hearts, that they may not turn from me."
Jeremiah,32,41,"I will rejoice in doing them good, and I will plant them in this land in faithfulness, with all my heart and all my soul."
Jeremiah,32,42,"“For thus says the Lord : Just as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so I will bring upon them all the good that I promise them."
Jeremiah,32,43,"Fields shall be bought in this land of which you are saying, It is a desolation, without man or beast; it is given into the hands of the Chaldeans."
Jeremiah,32,44,"Fields shall be bought for money, and deeds shall be signed and sealed and witnessed, in the land of Benjamin, in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, in the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the Shephelah, and in the cities of the Negeb; for I will restore their fortunes, says the Lord .”"
Jeremiah,33,1,"The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah a second time, while he was still shut up in the court of the guard:"
Jeremiah,33,2,"“Thus says the Lord who made the earth, the Lord who formed it to establish it—the Lord is his name:"
Jeremiah,33,3,"Call to me and I will answer you, and will tell you great and hidden things which you have not known."
Jeremiah,33,4,"For thus says the Lord , the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city and the houses of the kings of Judah which were torn down to make a defense against the siege mounds and before the sword:"
Jeremiah,33,5,"The Chaldeans are coming in to fight and to fill them with the dead bodies of men whom I shall smite in my anger and my wrath, for I have hidden my face from this city because of all their wickedness."
Jeremiah,33,6,"Behold, I will bring to it health and healing, and I will heal them and reveal to them abundance of prosperity and security."
Jeremiah,33,7,"I will restore the fortunes of Judah and the fortunes of Israel, and rebuild them as they were at first."
Jeremiah,33,8,"I will cleanse them from all the guilt of their sin against me, and I will forgive all the guilt of their sin and rebellion against me."
Jeremiah,33,9,"And this city shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and a glory before all the nations of the earth who shall hear of all the good that I do for them; they shall fear and tremble because of all the good and all the prosperity I provide for it."
Jeremiah,33,10,"“Thus says the Lord : In this place of which you say, ‘It is a waste without man or beast,’ in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate, without man or inhabitant or beast, there shall be heard again"
Jeremiah,33,11,"the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voices of those who sing, as they bring thank offerings to the house of the Lord: ‘Give thanks to the Lord of hosts, for the Lord is good, for his steadfast love endures for ever!’ For I will restore the fortunes of the land as at first, says the Lord."
Jeremiah,33,12,"“Thus says the Lord of hosts: In this place which is waste, without man or beast, and in all of its cities, there shall again be habitations of shepherds resting their flocks."
Jeremiah,33,13,"In the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the Shephelah, and in the cities of the Negeb, in the land of Benjamin, the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, flocks shall again pass under the hands of the one who counts them, says the Lord."
Jeremiah,33,14,"“Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord , when I will fulfil the promise I made to the house of Israel and the house of Judah."
Jeremiah,33,15,In those days and at that time I will cause a righteous Branch to spring forth for David; and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.
Jeremiah,33,16,In those days Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will dwell securely. And this is the name by which it will be called: ‘The Lord is our righteousness.’
Jeremiah,33,17,"“For thus says the Lord : David shall never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel,"
Jeremiah,33,18,"and the Levitical priests shall never lack a man in my presence to offer burnt offerings, to burn cereal offerings, and to make sacrifices for ever.”"
Jeremiah,33,19,The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah:
Jeremiah,33,20,"“Thus says the Lord : If you can break my covenant with the day and my covenant with the night, so that day and night will not come at their appointed time,"
Jeremiah,33,21,"then also my covenant with David my servant may be broken, so that he shall not have a son to reign on his throne, and my covenant with the Levitical priests my ministers."
Jeremiah,33,22,"As the host of heaven cannot be numbered and the sands of the sea cannot be measured, so I will multiply the descendants of David my servant, and the Levitical priests who minister to me.”"
Jeremiah,33,23,The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah:
Jeremiah,33,24,"“Have you not observed what these people are saying, ‘The Lord has rejected the two families which he chose’? Thus they have despised my people so that they are no longer a nation in their sight."
Jeremiah,33,25,"Thus says the Lord : If I have not established my covenant with day and night and the ordinances of heaven and earth,"
Jeremiah,33,26,"then I will reject the descendants of Jacob and David my servant and will not choose one of his descendants to rule over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For I will restore their fortunes, and will have mercy upon them.”"
Jeremiah,34,1,"The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord , when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms of the earth under his dominion and all the peoples were fighting against Jerusalem and all of its cities:"
Jeremiah,34,2,"“Thus says the Lord , the God of Israel: Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah and say to him, ‘Thus says the Lord : Behold, I am giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire."
Jeremiah,34,3,"You shall not escape from his hand, but shall surely be captured and delivered into his hand; you shall see the king of Babylon eye to eye and speak with him face to face; and you shall go to Babylon.’"
Jeremiah,34,4,"Yet hear the word of the Lord , O Zedekiah king of Judah! Thus says the Lord concerning you: ‘You shall not die by the sword."
Jeremiah,34,5,"You shall die in peace. And as spices were burned for your fathers, the former kings who were before you, so men shall burn spices for you and lament for you, saying, “Alas, lord!” ’ For I have spoken the word, says the Lord .”"
Jeremiah,34,6,"Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah, in Jerusalem,"
Jeremiah,34,7,"when the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and against all the cities of Judah that were left, Lachish and Azekah; for these were the only fortified cities of Judah that remained."
Jeremiah,34,8,"The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord , after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to make a proclamation of liberty to them,"
Jeremiah,34,9,"that every one should set free his Hebrew slaves, male and female, so that no one should enslave a Jew, his brother."
Jeremiah,34,10,"And they obeyed, all the princes and all the people who had entered into the covenant that every one would set free his slave, male or female, so that they would not be enslaved again; they obeyed and set them free."
Jeremiah,34,11,"But afterward they turned around and took back the male and female slaves they had set free, and brought them into subjection as slaves."
Jeremiah,34,12,The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah from the Lord:
Jeremiah,34,13,"“Thus says the Lord , the God of Israel: I made a covenant with your fathers when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying,"
Jeremiah,34,14,‘At the end of six years each of you must set free the fellow Hebrew who has been sold to you and has served you six years; you must set him free from your service.’ But your fathers did not listen to me or incline their ears to me.
Jeremiah,34,15,"You recently repented and did what was right in my eyes by proclaiming liberty, each to his neighbor, and you made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name;"
Jeremiah,34,16,"but then you turned around and profaned my name when each of you took back his male and female slaves, whom you had set free according to their desire, and you brought them into subjection to be your slaves."
Jeremiah,34,17,"Therefore, thus says the Lord : You have not obeyed me by proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother and to his neighbor; behold, I proclaim to you liberty to the sword, to pestilence, and to famine, says the Lord . I will make you a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth."
Jeremiah,34,18,"And the men who transgressed my covenant and did not keep the terms of the covenant which they made before me, I will make like the calf which they cut in two and passed between its parts—"
Jeremiah,34,19,"the princes of Judah, the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf;"
Jeremiah,34,20,and I will give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their lives. Their dead bodies shall be food for the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth.
Jeremiah,34,21,"And Zedekiah king of Judah, and his princes I will give into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their lives, into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon which has withdrawn from you."
Jeremiah,34,22,"Behold, I will command, says the Lord , and will bring them back to this city; and they will fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire. I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without inhabitant.”"
Jeremiah,35,1,"The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah:"
Jeremiah,35,2,"“Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak with them, and bring them to the house of the Lord , into one of the chambers; then offer them wine to drink.”"
Jeremiah,35,3,"So I took Ja-azaniah the son of Jeremiah, son of Habazziniah, and his brothers, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites."
Jeremiah,35,4,"I brought them to the house of the Lord into the chamber of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was near the chamber of the princes, above the chamber of Ma-aseiah the son of Shallum, keeper of the threshold."
Jeremiah,35,5,"Then I set before the Rechabites pitchers full of wine, and cups; and I said to them, “Drink wine.”"
Jeremiah,35,6,"But they answered, “We will drink no wine, for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, ‘You shall not drink wine, neither you nor your sons for ever;"
Jeremiah,35,7,"you shall not build a house; you shall not sow seed; you shall not plant or have a vineyard; but you shall live in tents all your days, that you may live many days in the land where you sojourn.’"
Jeremiah,35,8,"We have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he commanded us, to drink no wine all our days, ourselves, our wives, our sons, or our daughters,"
Jeremiah,35,9,and not to build houses to dwell in. We have no vineyard or field or seed;
Jeremiah,35,10,"but we have lived in tents, and have obeyed and done all that Jonadab our father commanded us."
Jeremiah,35,11,"But when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up against the land, we said, ‘Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans and the army of the Syrians.’ So we are living in Jerusalem.”"
Jeremiah,35,12,Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah:
Jeremiah,35,13,"“Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Go and say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will you not receive instruction and listen to my words? says the Lord."
Jeremiah,35,14,"The command which Jonadab the son of Rechab gave to his sons, to drink no wine, has been kept; and they drink none to this day, for they have obeyed their father's command. I have spoken to you persistently, but you have not listened to me."
Jeremiah,35,15,"I have sent to you all my servants the prophets, sending them persistently, saying, ‘Turn now every one of you from his evil way, and amend your doings, and do not go after other gods to serve them, and then you shall dwell in the land which I gave to you and your fathers.’ But you did not incline your ear or listen to me."
Jeremiah,35,16,"The sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have kept the command which their father gave them, but this people has not obeyed me."
Jeremiah,35,17,"Therefore, thus says the Lord , the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I am bringing on Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them; because I have spoken to them and they have not listened, I have called to them and they have not answered.”"
Jeremiah,35,18,"But to the house of the Rechabites Jeremiah said, “Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Because you have obeyed the command of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done all that he commanded you,"
Jeremiah,35,19,"therefore thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Jonadab the son of Rechab shall never lack a man to stand before me.”"
Jeremiah,36,1,"In the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord:"
Jeremiah,36,2,"“Take a scroll and write on it all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel and Judah and all the nations, from the day I spoke to you, from the days of Josiah until today."
Jeremiah,36,3,"It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I intend to do to them, so that every one may turn from his evil way, and that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.”"
Jeremiah,36,4,"Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah, and Baruch wrote upon a scroll at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the Lord which he had spoken to him."
Jeremiah,36,5,"And Jeremiah ordered Baruch, saying, “I am debarred from going to the house of the Lord;"
Jeremiah,36,6,"so you are to go, and on a fast day in the hearing of all the people in the Lord 's house you shall read the words of the Lord from the scroll which you have written at my dictation. You shall read them also in the hearing of all the men of Judah who come out of their cities."
Jeremiah,36,7,"It may be that their supplication will come before the Lord , and that every one will turn from his evil way, for great is the anger and wrath that the Lord has pronounced against this people.”"
Jeremiah,36,8,And Baruch the son of Neriah did all that Jeremiah the prophet ordered him about reading from the scroll the words of the Lord in the Lord 's house.
Jeremiah,36,9,"In the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem proclaimed a fast before the Lord."
Jeremiah,36,10,"Then, in the hearing of all the people, Baruch read the words of Jeremiah from the scroll, in the house of the Lord , in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the secretary, which was in the upper court, at the entry of the New Gate of the Lord 's house."
Jeremiah,36,11,"When Micaiah the son of Gemariah, son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the Lord from the scroll,"
Jeremiah,36,12,"he went down to the king's house, into the secretary's chamber; and all the princes were sitting there: Elishama the secretary, Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, Elnathan the son of Achbor, Gemariah the son of Shaphan, Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes."
Jeremiah,36,13,"And Micaiah told them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the scroll in the hearing of the people."
Jeremiah,36,14,"Then all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, son of Shelemiah, son of Cushi, to say to Baruch, “Take in your hand the scroll that you read in the hearing of the people, and come.” So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and came to them."
Jeremiah,36,15,"And they said to him, “Sit down and read it.” So Baruch read it to them."
Jeremiah,36,16,"When they heard all the words, they turned one to another in fear; and they said to Baruch, “We must report all these words to the king.”"
Jeremiah,36,17,"Then they asked Baruch, “Tell us, how did you write all these words? Was it at his dictation?”"
Jeremiah,36,18,"Baruch answered them, “He dictated all these words to me, while I wrote them with ink on the scroll.”"
Jeremiah,36,19,"Then the princes said to Baruch, “Go and hide, you and Jeremiah, and let no one know where you are.”"
Jeremiah,36,20,"So they went into the court to the king, having put the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the secretary; and they reported all the words to the king."
Jeremiah,36,21,"Then the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he took it from the chamber of Elishama the secretary; and Jehudi read it to the king and all the princes who stood beside the king."
Jeremiah,36,22,"It was the ninth month, and the king was sitting in the winter house and there was a fire burning in the brazier before him."
Jeremiah,36,23,"As Jehudi read three or four columns, the king would cut them off with a penknife and throw them into the fire in the brazier, until the entire scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier."
Jeremiah,36,24,"Yet neither the king, nor any of his servants who heard all these words, was afraid, nor did they rend their garments."
Jeremiah,36,25,"Even when Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them."
Jeremiah,36,26,"And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king's son and Seraiah the son of Azri-el and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel to seize Baruch the secretary and Jeremiah the prophet, but the Lord hid them."
Jeremiah,36,27,"Now, after the king had burned the scroll with the words which Baruch wrote at Jeremiah's dictation, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah:"
Jeremiah,36,28,"“Take another scroll and write on it all the former words that were in the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned."
Jeremiah,36,29,"And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, ‘Thus says the Lord , You have burned this scroll, saying, “Why have you written in it that the king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land, and will cut off from it man and beast?”"
Jeremiah,36,30,"Therefore thus says the Lord concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah, He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David, and his dead body shall be cast out to the heat by day and the frost by night."
Jeremiah,36,31,"And I will punish him and his offspring and his servants for their iniquity; I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them, but they would not hear.’ ”"
Jeremiah,36,32,"Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote on it at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the scroll which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and many similar words were added to them."
Jeremiah,37,1,"Zedekiah the son of Josiah, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah, reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim."
Jeremiah,37,2,But neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land listened to the words of the Lord which he spoke through Jeremiah the prophet.
Jeremiah,37,3,"King Zedekiah sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the priest, the son of Ma-aseiah, to Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “Pray for us to the Lord our God.”"
Jeremiah,37,4,"Now Jeremiah was still going in and out among the people, for he had not yet been put in prison."
Jeremiah,37,5,"The army of Pharaoh had come out of Egypt; and when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news of them, they withdrew from Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,37,6,Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet:
Jeremiah,37,7,"“Thus says the Lord , God of Israel: Thus shall you say to the king of Judah who sent you to me to inquire of me, ‘Behold, Pharaoh's army which came to help you is about to return to Egypt, to its own land."
Jeremiah,37,8,And the Chaldeans shall come back and fight against this city; they shall take it and burn it with fire.
Jeremiah,37,9,"Thus says the Lord , Do not deceive yourselves, saying, “The Chaldeans will surely stay away from us,” for they will not stay away."
Jeremiah,37,10,"For even if you should defeat the whole army of Chaldeans who are fighting against you, and there remained of them only wounded men, every man in his tent, they would rise up and burn this city with fire.’ ”"
Jeremiah,37,11,"Now when the Chaldean army had withdrawn from Jerusalem at the approach of Pharaoh's army,"
Jeremiah,37,12,Jeremiah set out from Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin to receive his portion there among the people.
Jeremiah,37,13,"When he was at the Benjamin Gate, a sentry there named Irijah the son of Shelemiah, son of Hananiah, seized Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “You are deserting to the Chaldeans.”"
Jeremiah,37,14,"And Jeremiah said, “It is false; I am not deserting to the Chaldeans.” But Irijah would not listen to him, and seized Jeremiah and brought him to the princes."
Jeremiah,37,15,"And the princes were enraged at Jeremiah, and they beat him and imprisoned him in the house of Jonathan the secretary, for it had been made a prison."
Jeremiah,37,16,"When Jeremiah had come to the dungeon cells, and remained there many days,"
Jeremiah,37,17,"King Zedekiah sent for him, and received him. The king questioned him secretly in his house, and said, “Is there any word from the Lord ?” Jeremiah said, “There is.” Then he said, “You shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.”"
Jeremiah,37,18,"Jeremiah also said to King Zedekiah, “What wrong have I done to you or your servants or this people, that you have put me in prison?"
Jeremiah,37,19,"Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you and against this land’?"
Jeremiah,37,20,"Now hear, I pray you, O my lord the king: let my humble plea come before you, and do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the secretary, lest I die there.”"
Jeremiah,37,21,"So King Zedekiah gave orders, and they committed Jeremiah to the court of the guard; and a loaf of bread was given him daily from the bakers' street, until all the bread of the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard."
Jeremiah,38,1,"Now Shephatiah the son of Mattan, Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchiah heard the words that Jeremiah was saying to all the people,"
Jeremiah,38,2,"“Thus says the Lord , He who stays in this city shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence; but he who goes out to the Chaldeans shall live; he shall have his life as a prize of war, and live."
Jeremiah,38,3,"Thus says the Lord , This city shall surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon and be taken.”"
Jeremiah,38,4,"Then the princes said to the king, “Let this man be put to death, for he is weakening the hands of the soldiers who are left in this city, and the hands of all the people, by speaking such words to them. For this man is not seeking the welfare of this people, but their harm.”"
Jeremiah,38,5,"King Zedekiah said, “Behold, he is in your hands; for the king can do nothing against you.”"
Jeremiah,38,6,"So they took Jeremiah and cast him into the cistern of Malchiah, the king's son, which was in the court of the guard, letting Jeremiah down by ropes. And there was no water in the cistern, but only mire, and Jeremiah sank in the mire."
Jeremiah,38,7,"When Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, who was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern—the king was sitting in the Benjamin Gate—"
Jeremiah,38,8,"Ebed-melech went from the king's house and said to the king,"
Jeremiah,38,9,"“My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they did to Jeremiah the prophet by casting him into the cistern; and he will die there of hunger, for there is no bread left in the city.”"
Jeremiah,38,10,"Then the king commanded Ebed-melech, the Ethiopian, “Take three men with you from here, and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies.”"
Jeremiah,38,11,"So Ebed-melech took the men with him and went to the house of the king, to a wardrobe of the storehouse, and took from there old rags and worn-out clothes, which he let down to Jeremiah in the cistern by ropes."
Jeremiah,38,12,"Then Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, “Put the rags and clothes between your armpits and the ropes.” Jeremiah did so."
Jeremiah,38,13,Then they drew Jeremiah up with ropes and lifted him out of the cistern. And Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.
Jeremiah,38,14,"King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and received him at the third entrance of the temple of the Lord . The king said to Jeremiah, “I will ask you a question; hide nothing from me.”"
Jeremiah,38,15,"Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I tell you, will you not be sure to put me to death? And if I give you counsel, you will not listen to me.”"
Jeremiah,38,16,"Then King Zedekiah swore secretly to Jeremiah, “As the Lord lives, who made our souls, I will not put you to death or deliver you into the hand of these men who seek your life.”"
Jeremiah,38,17,"Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “Thus says the Lord , the God of hosts, the God of Israel, If you will surrender to the princes of the king of Babylon, then your life shall be spared, and this city shall not be burned with fire, and you and your house shall live."
Jeremiah,38,18,"But if you do not surrender to the princes of the king of Babylon, then this city shall be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and you shall not escape from their hand.”"
Jeremiah,38,19,"King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Jews who have deserted to the Chaldeans, lest I be handed over to them and they abuse me.”"
Jeremiah,38,20,"Jeremiah said, “You shall not be given to them. Obey now the voice of the Lord in what I say to you, and it shall be well with you, and your life shall be spared."
Jeremiah,38,21,"But if you refuse to surrender, this is the vision which the Lord has shown to me:"
Jeremiah,38,22,"Behold, all the women left in the house of the king of Judah were being led out to the princes of the king of Babylon and were saying, ‘Your trusted friends have deceived you and prevailed against you; now that your feet are sunk in the mire, they turn away from you.’"
Jeremiah,38,23,"All your wives and your sons shall be led out to the Chaldeans, and you yourself shall not escape from their hand, but shall be seized by the king of Babylon; and this city shall be burned with fire.”"
Jeremiah,38,24,"Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Let no one know of these words and you shall not die."
Jeremiah,38,25,"If the princes hear that I have spoken with you and come to you and say to you, ‘Tell us what you said to the king and what the king said to you; hide nothing from us and we will not put you to death,’"
Jeremiah,38,26,"then you shall say to them, ‘I made a humble plea to the king that he would not send me back to the house of Jonathan to die there.’ ”"
Jeremiah,38,27,"Then all the princes came to Jeremiah and asked him, and he answered them as the king had instructed him. So they left off speaking with him, for the conversation had not been overheard."
Jeremiah,38,28,And Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken.
Jeremiah,39,1,"In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem and besieged it;"
Jeremiah,39,2,"in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, a breach was made in the city."
Jeremiah,39,3,"When Jerusalem was taken, all the princes of the king of Babylon came and sat in the middle gate: Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim the Rabsaris, Nergal-sharezer the Rabmag, with all the rest of the officers of the king of Babylon."
Jeremiah,39,4,"When Zedekiah king of Judah and all the soldiers saw them, they fled, going out of the city at night by way of the king's garden through the gate between the two walls; and they went toward the Arabah."
Jeremiah,39,5,"But the army of the Chaldeans pursued them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, at Riblah, in the land of Hamath; and he passed sentence upon him."
Jeremiah,39,6,The king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah at Riblah before his eyes; and the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.
Jeremiah,39,7,"He put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him in fetters to take him to Babylon."
Jeremiah,39,8,"The Chaldeans burned the king's house and the house of the people, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,39,9,"Then Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, carried into exile to Babylon the rest of the people who were left in the city, those who had deserted to him, and the people who remained."
Jeremiah,39,10,"Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, left in the land of Judah some of the poor people who owned nothing, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time."
Jeremiah,39,11,"Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave command concerning Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, saying,"
Jeremiah,39,12,"“Take him, look after him well and do him no harm, but deal with him as he tells you.”"
Jeremiah,39,13,"So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, Nebushazban the Rabsaris, Nergal-sharezer the Rabmag, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon"
Jeremiah,39,14,"sent and took Jeremiah from the court of the guard. They entrusted him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, that he should take him home. So he dwelt among the people."
Jeremiah,39,15,The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah while he was shut up in the court of the guard:
Jeremiah,39,16,"“Go, and say to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will fulfil my words against this city for evil and not for good, and they shall be accomplished before you on that day."
Jeremiah,39,17,"But I will deliver you on that day, says the Lord , and you shall not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid."
Jeremiah,39,18,"For I will surely save you, and you shall not fall by the sword; but you shall have your life as a prize of war, because you have put your trust in me, says the Lord .’ ”"
Jeremiah,40,1,"The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord after Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he took him bound in chains along with all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah who were being exiled to Babylon."
Jeremiah,40,2,"The captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him, “The Lord your God pronounced this evil against this place;"
Jeremiah,40,3,"the Lord has brought it about, and has done as he said. Because you sinned against the Lord , and did not obey his voice, this thing has come upon you."
Jeremiah,40,4,"Now, behold, I release you today from the chains on your hands. If it seems good to you to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will look after you well; but if it seems wrong to you to come with me to Babylon, do not come. See, the whole land is before you; go wherever you think it good and right to go."
Jeremiah,40,5,"If you remain, then return to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon appointed governor of the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people; or go wherever you think it right to go.” So the captain of the guard gave him an allowance of food and a present, and let him go."
Jeremiah,40,6,"Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, at Mizpah, and dwelt with him among the people who were left in the land."
Jeremiah,40,7,"When all the captains of the forces in the open country and their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed to him men, women, and children, those of the poorest of the land who had not been taken into exile to Babylon,"
Jeremiah,40,8,"they went to Gedaliah at Mizpah—Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, Johanan the son of Kareah, Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, Jezaniah the son of the Ma-acathite, they and their men."
Jeremiah,40,9,"Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, swore to them and their men, saying, “Do not be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you."
Jeremiah,40,10,"As for me, I will dwell at Mizpah, to stand for you before the Chaldeans who will come to us; but as for you, gather wine and summer fruits and oil, and store them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that you have taken.”"
Jeremiah,40,11,"Likewise, when all the Jews who were in Moab and among the Ammonites and in Edom and in other lands heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, as governor over them,"
Jeremiah,40,12,"then all the Jews returned from all the places to which they had been driven and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah; and they gathered wine and summer fruits in great abundance."
Jeremiah,40,13,Now Johanan the son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah
Jeremiah,40,14,"and said to him, “Do you know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life?” But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam would not believe them."
Jeremiah,40,15,"Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke secretly to Gedaliah at Mizpah, “Let me go and slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no one will know it. Why should he take your life, so that all the Jews who are gathered about you would be scattered, and the remnant of Judah would perish?”"
Jeremiah,40,16,"But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, “You shall not do this thing, for you are speaking falsely of Ishmael.”"
Jeremiah,41,1,"In the seventh month, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, son of Elishama, of the royal family, one of the chief officers of the king, came with ten men to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, at Mizpah. As they ate bread together there at Mizpah,"
Jeremiah,41,2,"Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the ten men with him rose up and struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, with the sword, and killed him, whom the king of Babylon had appointed governor in the land."
Jeremiah,41,3,"Ishmael also slew all the Jews who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, and the Chaldean soldiers who happened to be there."
Jeremiah,41,4,"On the day after the murder of Gedaliah, before any one knew of it,"
Jeremiah,41,5,"eighty men arrived from Shechem and Shiloh and Samaria, with their beards shaved and their clothes torn, and their bodies gashed, bringing cereal offerings and incense to present at the temple of the Lord."
Jeremiah,41,6,"And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah came out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he came. As he met them, he said to them, “Come in to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.”"
Jeremiah,41,7,"When they came into the city, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the men with him slew them, and cast them into a cistern."
Jeremiah,41,8,"But there were ten men among them who said to Ishmael, “Do not kill us, for we have stores of wheat, barley, oil, and honey hidden in the fields.” So he refrained and did not kill them with their companions."
Jeremiah,41,9,Now the cistern into which Ishmael cast all the bodies of the men whom he had slain was the large cistern which King Asa had made for defense against Baasha king of Israel; Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain.
Jeremiah,41,10,"Then Ishmael took captive all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah, the king's daughters and all the people who were left at Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. Ishmael the son of Nethaniah took them captive and set out to cross over to the Ammonites."
Jeremiah,41,11,"But when Johanan the son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces with him heard of all the evil which Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,"
Jeremiah,41,12,they took all their men and went to fight against Ishmael the son of Nethaniah. They came upon him at the great pool which is in Gibeon.
Jeremiah,41,13,"And when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces with him, they rejoiced."
Jeremiah,41,14,"So all the people whom Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned about and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah."
Jeremiah,41,15,"But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites."
Jeremiah,41,16,"Then Johanan the son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces with him took all the rest of the people whom Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had carried away captive from Mizpah after he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam—soldiers, women, children, and eunuchs, whom Johanan brought back from Gibeon."
Jeremiah,41,17,"And they went and stayed at Geruth Chimham near Bethlehem, intending to go to Egypt"
Jeremiah,41,18,"because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land."
Jeremiah,42,1,"Then all the commanders of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah and Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least to the greatest, came near"
Jeremiah,42,2,"and said to Jeremiah the prophet, “Let our supplication come before you, and pray to the Lord your God for us, for all this remnant (for we are left but a few of many, as your eyes see us),"
Jeremiah,42,3,"that the Lord your God may show us the way we should go, and the thing that we should do.”"
Jeremiah,42,4,"Jeremiah the prophet said to them, “I have heard you; behold, I will pray to the Lord your God according to your request, and whatever the Lord answers you I will tell you; I will keep nothing back from you.”"
Jeremiah,42,5,"Then they said to Jeremiah, “May the Lord be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not act according to all the word with which the Lord your God sends you to us."
Jeremiah,42,6,"Whether it is good or evil, we will obey the voice of the Lord our God to whom we are sending you, that it may be well with us when we obey the voice of the Lord our God.”"
Jeremiah,42,7,At the end of ten days the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah.
Jeremiah,42,8,"Then he summoned Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces who were with him, and all the people from the least to the greatest,"
Jeremiah,42,9,"and said to them, “Thus says the Lord , the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your supplication before him:"
Jeremiah,42,10,"If you will remain in this land, then I will build you up and not pull you down; I will plant you, and not pluck you up; for I repent of the evil which I did to you."
Jeremiah,42,11,"Do not fear the king of Babylon, of whom you are afraid; do not fear him, says the Lord , for I am with you, to save you and to deliver you from his hand."
Jeremiah,42,12,"I will grant you mercy, that he may have mercy on you and let you remain in your own land."
Jeremiah,42,13,"But if you say, ‘We will not remain in this land,’ disobeying the voice of the Lord your God"
Jeremiah,42,14,"and saying, ‘No, we will go to the land of Egypt, where we shall not see war, or hear the sound of the trumpet, or be hungry for bread, and we will dwell there,’"
Jeremiah,42,15,"then hear the word of the Lord , O remnant of Judah. Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: If you set your faces to enter Egypt and go to live there,"
Jeremiah,42,16,then the sword which you fear shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt; and the famine of which you are afraid shall follow hard after you to Egypt; and there you shall die.
Jeremiah,42,17,"All the men who set their faces to go to Egypt to live there shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence; they shall have no remnant or survivor from the evil which I will bring upon them."
Jeremiah,42,18,"“For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: As my anger and my wrath were poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so my wrath will be poured out on you when you go to Egypt. You shall become an execration, a horror, a curse, and a taunt. You shall see this place no more."
Jeremiah,42,19,"The Lord has said to you, O remnant of Judah, ‘Do not go to Egypt.’ Know for a certainty that I have warned you this day"
Jeremiah,42,20,"that you have gone astray at the cost of your lives. For you sent me to the Lord your God, saying, ‘Pray for us to the Lord our God, and whatever the Lord our God says declare to us and we will do it.’"
Jeremiah,42,21,"And I have this day declared it to you, but you have not obeyed the voice of the Lord your God in anything that he sent me to tell you."
Jeremiah,42,22,"Now therefore know for a certainty that you shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence in the place where you desire to go to live.”"
Jeremiah,43,1,"When Jeremiah finished speaking to all the people all these words of the Lord their God, with which the Lord their God had sent him to them,"
Jeremiah,43,2,"Azariah the son of Hoshaiah and Johanan the son of Kareah and all the insolent men said to Jeremiah, “You are telling a lie. The Lord our God did not send you to say, ‘Do not go to Egypt to live there’;"
Jeremiah,43,3,"but Baruch the son of Neriah has set you against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may kill us or take us into exile in Babylon.”"
Jeremiah,43,4,"So Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces and all the people did not obey the voice of the Lord , to remain in the land of Judah."
Jeremiah,43,5,But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces took all the remnant of Judah who had returned to live in the land of Judah from all the nations to which they had been driven—
Jeremiah,43,6,"the men, the women, the children, the princesses, and every person whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan; also Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch the son of Neriah."
Jeremiah,43,7,"And they came into the land of Egypt, for they did not obey the voice of the Lord . And they arrived at Tahpanhes."
Jeremiah,43,8,Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes:
Jeremiah,43,9,"“Take in your hands large stones, and hide them in the mortar in the pavement which is at the entrance to Pharaoh's palace in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah,"
Jeremiah,43,10,"and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and he will set his throne above these stones which I have hid, and he will spread his royal canopy over them."
Jeremiah,43,11,"He shall come and smite the land of Egypt, giving to the pestilence those who are doomed to the pestilence, to captivity those who are doomed to captivity, and to the sword those who are doomed to the sword."
Jeremiah,43,12,"He shall kindle a fire in the temples of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them and carry them away captive; and he shall clean the land of Egypt, as a shepherd cleans his cloak of vermin; and he shall go away from there in peace."

Jeremiah,51,55,"For the Lord is laying Babylon waste, and stilling her mighty voice. Their waves roar like many waters, the noise of their voice is raised;"

Jeremiah,52,1,Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
Jeremiah,52,2,"And he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord , according to all that Jehoiakim had done."
Jeremiah,52,3,Surely because of the anger of the Lord things came to such a pass in Jerusalem and Judah that he cast them out from his presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
Jeremiah,52,4,"And in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came with all his army against Jerusalem, and they laid siege to it and built siegeworks against it round about."

Jeremiah,52,12,"In the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month—which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon—Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard who served the king of Babylon, entered Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,52,13,"And he burned the house of the Lord , and the king's house and all the houses of Jerusalem; every great house he burned down."
Jeremiah,52,14,"And all the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls round about Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,52,15,"And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive some of the poorest of the people and the rest of the people who were left in the city and the deserters who had deserted to the king of Babylon, together with the rest of the artisans."
Jeremiah,52,16,But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and plowmen.
Jeremiah,52,17,"And the pillars of bronze that were in the house of the Lord , and the stands and the bronze sea that were in the house of the Lord , the Chaldeans broke in pieces, and carried all the bronze to Babylon."
Jeremiah,52,18,"And they took away the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the dishes for incense, and all the vessels of bronze used in the temple service;"
Jeremiah,52,19,"also the small bowls, and the firepans, and the basins, and the pots, and the lampstands, and the dishes for incense, and the bowls for libation. What was of gold the captain of the guard took away as gold, and what was of silver, as silver."
Jeremiah,52,20,"As for the two pillars, the one sea, the twelve bronze bulls which were under the sea, and the stands, which Solomon the king had made for the house of the Lord , the bronze of all these things was beyond weight."
Jeremiah,52,21,"As for the pillars, the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, its circumference was twelve cubits, and its thickness was four fingers, and it was hollow."
Jeremiah,52,22,"Upon it was a capital of bronze; the height of the one capital was five cubits; a network and pomegranates, all of bronze, were upon the capital round about. And the second pillar had the like, with pomegranates."
Jeremiah,52,23,There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; all the pomegranates were a hundred upon the network round about.
Jeremiah,52,24,"And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold;"
Jeremiah,52,25,"and from the city he took an officer who had been in command of the men of war, and seven men of the king's council, who were found in the city; and the secretary of the commander of the army who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, who were found in the midst of the city."
Jeremiah,52,26,"And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah."
Jeremiah,52,27,"And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried captive out of its land."
Jeremiah,52,28,"This is the number of the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year, three thousand and twenty-three Jews;"
Jeremiah,52,29,in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred and thirty-two persons;
Jeremiah,52,30,"in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadrezzar, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred and forty-five persons; all the persons were four thousand and six hundred."
Jeremiah,52,31,"And in the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth day of the month, Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he became king, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah and brought him out of prison;"
Jeremiah,52,32,"and he spoke kindly to him, and gave him a seat above the seats of the kings who were with him in Babylon."
Jeremiah,52,33,So Jehoiachin put off his prison garments. And every day of his life he dined regularly at the king's table;
Jeremiah,52,34,"as for his allowance, a regular allowance was given him by the king according to his daily need, until the day of his death as long as he lived."
