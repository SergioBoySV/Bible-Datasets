Amos,2,5,"So I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the strongholds of Jerusalem.”"
Amos,2,6,"Thus says the Lord: “For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment; because they sell the righteous for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes—"
Amos,2,7,"they that trample the head of the poor into the dust of the earth, and turn aside the way of the afflicted; a man and his father go in to the same maiden, so that my holy name is profaned;"
Amos,2,8,they lay themselves down beside every altar upon garments taken in pledge; and in the house of their God they drink the wine of those who have been fined.
Amos,2,9,"“Yet I destroyed the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and who was as strong as the oaks; I destroyed his fruit above, and his roots beneath."

Amos,3,3,"“Do two walk together, unless they have made an appointment?"
Amos,3,4,"Does a lion roar in the forest, when he has no prey? Does a young lion cry out from his den, if he has taken nothing?"
Amos,3,5,"Does a bird fall in a snare on the earth, when there is no trap for it? Does a snare spring up from the ground, when it has taken nothing?"
Amos,3,6,"Is a trumpet blown in a city, and the people are not afraid? Does evil befall a city, unless the Lord has done it?"
Amos,3,7," Surely the Lord God does nothing, without revealing his secret to his servants the prophets."
Amos,3,8,The lion has roared; who will not fear? The Lord God has spoken; who can but prophesy?”
Amos,3,9,"Proclaim to the strongholds in Assyria, and to the strongholds in the land of Egypt, and say, “Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and see the great tumults within her, and the oppressions in her midst.”"
Amos,3,10,"“They do not know how to do right,” says the Lord, “those who store up violence and robbery in their strongholds.”"
Amos,3,11,"Therefore thus says the Lord God: “An adversary shall surround the land, and bring down your defenses from you, and your strongholds shall be plundered.”"
Amos,3,12,"Thus says the Lord : “As the shepherd rescues from the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear, so shall the people of Israel who dwell in Samaria be rescued, with the corner of a couch and part of a bed.”"
Amos,3,13,"“Hear, and testify against the house of Jacob,” says the Lord God , the God of hosts,"
Amos,3,14,"“that on the day I punish Israel for his transgressions, I will punish the altars of Bethel, and the horns of the altar shall be cut off and fall to the ground."

Amos,4,11,"“I overthrew some of you, as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and you were as a brand plucked out of the burning; yet you did not return to me,” says the Lord."
Amos,4,12,"“Therefore thus I will do to you, O Israel; because I will do this to you, prepare to meet your God, O Israel!”"
Amos,4,13,"For lo, he who forms the mountains, and creates the wind, and declares to man what is his thought; who makes the morning darkness, and treads on the heights of the earth— the Lord , the God of hosts, is his name!"
Amos,5,1,"Hear this word which I take up over you in lamentation, O house of Israel:"
Amos,5,2,"“Fallen, no more to rise, is the virgin Israel; forsaken on her land, with none to raise her up.”"
Amos,5,3,"For thus says the Lord God: “The city that went forth a thousand shall have a hundred left, and that which went forth a hundred shall have ten left to the house of Israel.”"
Amos,5,4,For thus says the Lord to the house of Israel: “Seek me and live;
Amos,5,5,"but do not seek Bethel, and do not enter into Gilgal or cross over to Beer-sheba; for Gilgal shall surely go into exile, and Bethel shall come to naught.”"

Amos,5,7,"O you who turn justice to wormwood, and cast down righteousness to the earth!"
Amos,5,8,"He who made the Pleiades and Orion, and turns deep darkness into the morning, and darkens the day into night, who calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out upon the surface of the earth, the Lord is his name,"
Amos,5,9,"who makes destruction flash forth against the strong, so that destruction comes upon the fortress."
Amos,5,10,"They hate him who reproves in the gate, and they abhor him who speaks the truth."
Amos,5,11,"Therefore because you trample upon the poor and take from him exactions of wheat, you have built houses of hewn stone, but you shall not dwell in them; you have planted pleasant vineyards, but you shall not drink their wine."
Amos,5,12,"For I know how many are your transgressions, and how great are your sins— you who afflict the righteous, who take a bribe, and turn aside the needy in the gate."
Amos,5,13,Therefore he who is prudent will keep silent in such a time; for it is an evil time.
Amos,5,14,"Seek good, and not evil, that you may live; and so the Lord , the God of hosts, will be with you, as you have said."
Amos,5,15,"Hate evil, and love good, and establish justice in the gate; it may be that the Lord , the God of hosts, will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph."
Amos,5,16,"Therefore thus says the Lord , the God of hosts, the Lord: “In all the squares there shall be wailing; and in all the streets they shall say, ‘Alas! alas!’ They shall call the farmers to mourning and to wailing those who are skilled in lamentation,"
Amos,5,17,"and in all vineyards there shall be wailing, for I will pass through the midst of you,” says the Lord."
Amos,5,18,"Woe to you who desire the day of the Lord! Why would you have the day of the Lord? It is darkness, and not light;"

Amos,5,22,"Even though you offer me your burnt offerings and cereal offerings, I will not accept them, and the peace offerings of your fatted beasts I will not look upon."

Amos,5,26,"You shall take up Sakkuth your king, and Kaiwan your star-god, your images, which you made for yourselves;"
Amos,5,27,"therefore I will take you into exile beyond Damascus,” says the Lord , whose name is the God of hosts."
Amos,6,1,"“Woe to those who are at ease in Zion, and to those who feel secure on the mountain of Samaria, the notable men of the first of the nations, to whom the house of Israel come!"
Amos,6,2,"Pass over to Calneh, and see; and thence go to Hamath the great; then go down to Gath of the Philistines. Are they better than these kingdoms? Or is their territory greater than your territory,"
Amos,6,3,"O you who put far away the evil day, and bring near the seat of violence?"
Amos,6,4,"“Woe to those who lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat lambs from the flock, and calves from the midst of the stall;"
Amos,6,5,"who sing idle songs to the sound of the harp, and like David invent for themselves instruments of music;"
Amos,6,6,"who drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the finest oils, but are not grieved over the ruin of Joseph!"
Amos,6,7,"Therefore they shall now be the first of those to go into exile, and the revelry of those who stretch themselves shall pass away.”"
Amos,6,8,"The Lord God has sworn by himself (says the Lord , the God of hosts): “I abhor the pride of Jacob, and hate his strongholds; and I will deliver up the city and all that is in it.”"
Amos,6,9,"And if ten men remain in one house, they shall die."
Amos,6,10,"And when a man's kinsman, he who burns him, shall take him up to bring the bones out of the house, and shall say to him who is in the innermost parts of the house, “Is there still any one with you?” he shall say, “No”; and he shall say, “Hush! We must not mention the name of the Lord .”"
Amos,6,11,"For behold, the Lord commands, and the great house shall be smitten into fragments, and the little house into bits."
Amos,6,12,Do horses run upon rocks? Does one plow the sea with oxen? But you have turned justice into poison and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood—
Amos,6,13,"you who rejoice in Lo-debar, who say, “Have we not by our own strength taken Karnaim for ourselves?”"
Amos,6,14,"“For behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel,” says the Lord , the God of hosts; “and they shall oppress you from the entrance of Hamath to the Brook of the Arabah.”"
Amos,7,1,"Thus the Lord God showed me: behold, he was forming locusts in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and lo, it was the latter growth after the king's mowings."
Amos,7,2,"When they had finished eating the grass of the land, I said, “O Lord God , forgive, I beseech thee! How can Jacob stand? He is so small!”"
Amos,7,3,"The Lord repented concerning this; “It shall not be,” said the Lord."
Amos,7,4,"Thus the Lord God showed me: behold, the Lord God was calling for a judgment by fire, and it devoured the great deep and was eating up the land."
Amos,7,5,"Then I said, “O Lord God , cease, I beseech thee! How can Jacob stand? He is so small!”"
Amos,7,6,"The Lord repented concerning this; “This also shall not be,” said the Lord God."
Amos,7,7,"He showed me: behold, the Lord was standing beside a wall built with a plumb line, with a plumb line in his hand."
Amos,7,8,"And the Lord said to me, “Amos, what do you see?” And I said, “A plumb line.” Then the Lord said, “Behold, I am setting a plumb line in the midst of my people Israel; I will never again pass by them;"
Amos,7,9,"the high places of Isaac shall be made desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste, and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.”"
Amos,7,10,"Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, “Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel; the land is not able to bear all his words."
Amos,7,11,"For thus Amos has said, ‘Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel must go into exile away from his land.’ ”"
Amos,7,12,"And Amaziah said to Amos, “O seer, go, flee away to the land of Judah, and eat bread there, and prophesy there;"
Amos,7,13,"but never again prophesy at Bethel, for it is the king's sanctuary, and it is a temple of the kingdom.”"
Amos,7,14,"Then Amos answered Amaziah, “I am no prophet, nor a prophet's son; but I am a herdsman, and a dresser of sycamore trees,"
Amos,7,15,"and the Lord took me from following the flock, and the Lord said to me, ‘Go, prophesy to my people Israel.’"
Amos,7,16,"“Now therefore hear the word of the Lord. You say, ‘Do not prophesy against Israel, and do not preach against the house of Isaac.’"
Amos,7,17,"Therefore thus says the Lord: ‘Your wife shall be a harlot in the city, and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the sword, and your land shall be parceled out by line; you yourself shall die in an unclean land, and Israel shall surely go into exile away from its land.’ ”"
Amos,8,1,"Thus the Lord God showed me: behold, a basket of summer fruit."
Amos,8,2,"And he said, “Amos, what do you see?” And I said, “A basket of summer fruit.” Then the Lord said to me, “The end has come upon my people Israel; I will never again pass by them."
Amos,8,3,"The songs of the temple shall become wailings in that day,” says the Lord God; “the dead bodies shall be many; in every place they shall be cast out in silence.”"
Amos,8,4,"Hear this, you who trample upon the needy, and bring the poor of the land to an end,"
Amos,8,5,"saying, “When will the new moon be over, that we may sell grain? And the sabbath, that we may offer wheat for sale, that we may make the ephah small and the shekel great, and deal deceitfully with false balances,"
Amos,8,6,"that we may buy the poor for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals, and sell the refuse of the wheat?”"
Amos,8,7,The Lord has sworn by the pride of Jacob: “Surely I will never forget any of their deeds.
Amos,8,8,"Shall not the land tremble on this account, and every one mourn who dwells in it, and all of it rise like the Nile, and be tossed about and sink again, like the Nile of Egypt?”"
Amos,8,9,"“And on that day,” says the Lord God, “I will make the sun go down at noon, and darken the earth in broad daylight."
Amos,8,10,"I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; I will bring sackcloth upon all loins, and baldness on every head; I will make it like the mourning for an only son, and the end of it like a bitter day."
Amos,8,11,"“Behold, the days are coming,” says the Lord God, “when I will send a famine on the land; not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord."
Amos,8,12,"They shall wander from sea to sea, and from north to east; they shall run to and fro, to seek the word of the Lord, but they shall not find it."
Amos,8,13,“In that day the fair virgins and the young men shall faint for thirst.
Amos,8,14,"Those who swear by Ashimah of Samaria, and say, ‘As thy god lives, O Dan,’ and, ‘As the way of Beer-sheba lives,’ they shall fall, and never rise again.”"
Amos,9,1,"I saw the Lord standing beside the altar, and he said: “Smite the capitals until the thresholds shake, and shatter them on the heads of all the people; and what are left of them I will slay with the sword; not one of them shall flee away, not one of them shall escape."
Amos,9,2,"“Though they dig into Sheol, from there shall my hand take them; though they climb up to heaven, from there I will bring them down."
Amos,9,3,"Though they hide themselves on the top of Carmel, from there I will search out and take them; and though they hide from my sight at the bottom of the sea, there I will command the serpent, and it shall bite them."
Amos,9,4,"And though they go into captivity before their enemies, there I will command the sword, and it shall slay them; and I will set my eyes upon them for evil and not for good.”"
Amos,9,5,"The Lord, God of hosts, he who touches the earth and it melts, and all who dwell in it mourn, and all of it rises like the Nile, and sinks again, like the Nile of Egypt;"
Amos,9,6,"who builds his upper chambers in the heavens, and founds his vault upon the earth; who calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out upon the surface of the earth— the Lord is his name."
Amos,9,7,"“Are you not like the Ethiopians to me, O people of Israel?” says the Lord. “Did I not bring up Israel from the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor and the Syrians from Kir?"
Amos,9,8,"Behold, the eyes of the Lord God are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from the surface of the ground; except that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob,” says the Lord."
Amos,9,9,"“For lo, I will command, and shake the house of Israel among all the nations as one shakes with a sieve, but no pebble shall fall upon the earth."
Amos,9,10,"All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, who say, ‘Evil shall not overtake or meet us.’"
Amos,9,11," “In that day I will raise up the booth of David that is fallen and repair its breaches, and raise up its ruins, and rebuild it as in the days of old;"
Amos,9,12,"that they may possess the remnant of Edom and all the nations who are called by my name,” says the Lord who does this."
Amos,9,13," “Behold, the days are coming,” says the Lord, “when the plowman shall overtake the reaper and the treader of grapes him who sows the seed; the mountains shall drip sweet wine, and all the hills shall flow with it."
Amos,9,14,"I will restore the fortunes of my people Israel, and they shall rebuild the ruined cities and inhabit them; they shall plant vineyards and drink their wine, and they shall make gardens and eat their fruit."
Amos,9,15,"I will plant them upon their land, and they shall never again be plucked up out of the land which I have given them,” says the Lord your God."
