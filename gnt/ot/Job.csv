Job,1,1,"There was a man named Job, living in the land of Uz, who worshiped God and was faithful to him. He was a good man, careful not to do anything evil."
Job,1,2,"He had seven sons and three daughters,"
Job,1,3,"and owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, one thousand head of cattle, and five hundred donkeys. He also had a large number of servants and was the richest man in the East."
Job,1,4,"Job's sons used to take turns giving a feast, to which all the others would come, and they always invited their three sisters to join them."
Job,1,5,"The morning after each feast, Job would get up early and offer sacrifices for each of his children in order to purify them. He always did this because he thought that one of them might have sinned by insulting God unintentionally."
Job,1,6," When the day came for the heavenly beings to appear before the Lord , Satan was there among them."
Job,1,7,"The Lord asked him, “What have you been doing?” Satan answered, “I have been walking here and there, roaming around the earth.”"
Job,1,8,“Did you notice my servant Job?” the Lord asked. “There is no one on earth as faithful and good as he is. He worships me and is careful not to do anything evil.”
Job,1,9," Satan replied, “Would Job worship you if he got nothing out of it?"
Job,1,10,"You have always protected him and his family and everything he owns. You bless everything he does, and you have given him enough cattle to fill the whole country."
Job,1,11,But now suppose you take away everything he has—he will curse you to your face!”
Job,1,12,"“All right,” the Lord said to Satan, “everything he has is in your power, but you must not hurt Job himself.” So Satan left."
Job,1,13,"One day when Job's children were having a feast at the home of their oldest brother,"
Job,1,14,"a messenger came running to Job. “We were plowing the fields with the oxen,” he said, “and the donkeys were in a nearby pasture."
Job,1,15,Suddenly the Sabeans attacked and stole them all. They killed every one of your servants except me. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”
Job,1,16,"Before he had finished speaking, another servant came and said, “Lightning struck the sheep and the shepherds and killed them all. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”"
Job,1,17,"Before he had finished speaking, another servant came and said, “Three bands of Chaldean raiders attacked us, took away the camels, and killed all your servants except me. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”"
Job,1,18,"Before he had finished speaking, another servant came and said, “Your children were having a feast at the home of your oldest son,"
Job,1,19,when a storm swept in from the desert. It blew the house down and killed them all. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”
Job,1,20,Then Job got up and tore his clothes in grief. He shaved his head and threw himself face downward on the ground.
Job,1,21,"He said, “I was born with nothing, and I will die with nothing. The Lord gave, and now he has taken away. May his name be praised!”"
Job,1,22,"In spite of everything that had happened, Job did not sin by blaming God."
Job,2,1,"When the day came for the heavenly beings to appear before the Lord again, Satan was there among them."
Job,2,2,"The Lord asked him, “Where have you been?” Satan answered, “I have been walking here and there, roaming around the earth.”"
Job,2,3,"“Did you notice my servant Job?” the Lord asked. “There is no one on earth as faithful and good as he is. He worships me and is careful not to do anything evil. You persuaded me to let you attack him for no reason at all, but Job is still as faithful as ever.”"
Job,2,4,"Satan replied, “A person will give up everything in order to stay alive."
Job,2,5,But now suppose you hurt his body—he will curse you to your face!”
Job,2,6,"So the Lord said to Satan, “All right, he is in your power, but you are not to kill him.”"
Job,2,7,Then Satan left the Lord 's presence and made sores break out all over Job's body.
Job,2,8,Job went and sat by the garbage dump and took a piece of broken pottery to scrape his sores.
Job,2,9,"His wife said to him, “You are still as faithful as ever, aren't you? Why don't you curse God and die?”"
Job,2,10,"Job answered, “You are talking nonsense! When God sends us something good, we welcome it. How can we complain when he sends us trouble?” Even in all this suffering Job said nothing against God."
Job,2,11,"Three of Job's friends were Eliphaz, from the city of Teman, Bildad, from the land of Shuah, and Zophar, from the land of Naamah. When they heard how much Job had been suffering, they decided to go and comfort him."
Job,2,12,"While they were still a long way off they saw Job, but did not recognize him. When they did, they began to weep and wail, tearing their clothes in grief and throwing dust into the air and on their heads."
Job,2,13,"Then they sat there on the ground with him for seven days and nights without saying a word, because they saw how much he was suffering."
Job,3,1, Finally Job broke the silence and cursed the day on which he had been born.
Job,5,1,"Call out, Job. See if anyone answers. Is there any angel to whom you can turn?"
Job,5,2,"To worry yourself to death with resentment would be a foolish, senseless thing to do."
Job,5,3,"I have seen fools who looked secure, but I called down a sudden curse on their homes."
Job,5,4,Their children can never find safety; no one stands up to defend them in court.
Job,5,5,Hungry people will eat the fool's crops— even the grain growing among thorns — and thirsty people will envy his wealth.
Job,5,6,"Evil does not grow in the soil, nor does trouble grow out of the ground."
Job,5,7,"No indeed! We bring trouble on ourselves, as surely as sparks fly up from a fire."
Job,5,8,"If I were you, I would turn to God and present my case to him."
Job,5,9," We cannot understand the great things he does, and to his miracles there is no end."
Job,5,10,He sends rain on the land and he waters the fields.
Job,5,11,"Yes, it is God who raises the humble and gives joy to all who mourn."
Job,7,1,"Human life is like forced army service, like a life of hard manual labor,"
Job,7,2,like a slave longing for cool shade; like a worker waiting to be paid.
Job,7,3,Month after month I have nothing to live for; night after night brings me grief.
Job,7,4,"When I lie down to sleep, the hours drag; I toss all night and long for dawn."
Job,7,5,My body is full of worms; it is covered with scabs; pus runs out of my sores.
Job,7,6,"My days pass by without hope, pass faster than a weaver's shuttle."
Job,7,7,"Remember, O God, my life is only a breath; my happiness has already ended."
Job,7,8,"You see me now, but never again. If you look for me, I'll be gone."
Job,10,1,I am tired of living. Listen to my bitter complaint.
Job,10,2,"Don't condemn me, God. Tell me! What is the charge against me?"
Job,10,3,Is it right for you to be so cruel? To despise what you yourself have made? And then to smile on the schemes of wicked people?
Job,10,4,Do you see things as we do?
Job,10,5,Is your life as short as ours?
Job,10,6,Then why do you track down all my sins and hunt down every fault I have?
Job,10,7," You know that I am not guilty, that no one can save me from you."
Job,10,8,"Your hands formed and shaped me, and now those same hands destroy me."
Job,10,9,Remember that you made me from clay; are you going to crush me back to dust?
Job,10,10, You gave my father strength to beget me; you made me grow in my mother's womb.
Job,10,11,You formed my body with bones and sinews and covered the bones with muscles and skin.
Job,10,12,"You have given me life and constant love, and your care has kept me alive."
Job,10,13,But now I know that all that time you were secretly planning to harm me.
Job,10,14,"You were watching to see if I would sin, so that you could refuse to forgive me."
Job,10,15,"As soon as I sin, I'm in trouble with you, but when I do right, I get no credit. I am miserable and covered with shame."
Job,10,16,"If I have any success at all, you hunt me down like a lion; to hurt me you even work miracles."
Job,10,17,You always have some witness against me; your anger toward me grows and grows; you always plan some new attack.
Job,10,18,"Why, God, did you let me be born? I should have died before anyone saw me."
Job,10,19,To go from the womb straight to the grave would have been as good as never existing.
Job,10,20,Isn't my life almost over? Leave me alone! Let me enjoy the time I have left.
Job,10,21,"I am going soon and will never come back— going to a land that is dark and gloomy,"
Job,10,22,"a land of darkness, shadows, and confusion, where the light itself is darkness."
Job,14,1," We are all born weak and helpless. All lead the same short, troubled life."
Job,14,2,We grow and wither as quickly as flowers; we disappear like shadows.
Job,14,3,"Will you even look at me, God, or put me on trial and judge me?"
Job,14,4,Nothing clean can ever come from anything as unclean as human beings.
Job,14,5,"The length of our lives is decided beforehand— the number of months we will live. You have settled it, and it can't be changed."
Job,14,6,Look away from us and leave us alone; let us enjoy our hard life—if we can.
Job,14,7,There is hope for a tree that has been cut down; it can come back to life and sprout.
Job,14,8,"Even though its roots grow old, and its stump dies in the ground,"
Job,14,9,with water it will sprout like a young plant.
Job,14,10,"But we die, and that is the end of us; we die, and where are we then?"
Job,14,11,"Like rivers that stop running, and lakes that go dry,"
Job,14,12,"people die, never to rise. They will never wake up while the sky endures; they will never stir from their sleep."
Job,14,13,"I wish you would hide me in the world of the dead; let me be hidden until your anger is over, and then set a time to remember me."
Job,14,14,"If a man dies, can he come back to life? But I will wait for better times, wait till this time of trouble is ended."
Job,14,15,"Then you will call, and I will answer, and you will be pleased with me, your creature."
Job,14,16,"Then you will watch every step I take, but you will not keep track of my sins."
Job,14,17,You will forgive them and put them away; you will wipe out all the wrongs I have done.
Job,14,18,There comes a time when mountains fall and solid cliffs are moved away.
Job,14,19,"Water will wear down rocks, and heavy rain will wash away the soil; so you destroy our hope for life."
Job,14,20,You overpower us and send us away forever; our faces are twisted in death.
Job,14,21,"Our children win honor, but we never know it, nor are we told when they are disgraced."
Job,14,22,We feel only the pain of our own bodies and the grief of our own minds.
Job,17,1,The end of my life is near. I can hardly breathe; there is nothing left for me but the grave.
Job,17,2,I watch how bitterly everyone mocks me.
Job,17,3,"I am being honest, God. Accept my word. There is no one else to support what I say."
Job,17,4,You have closed their minds to reason; don't let them triumph over me now.
Job,17,5,"In the old proverb someone betrays his friends for money, and his children suffer for it."
Job,17,6,And now people use this proverb against me; they come and spit in my face.
Job,17,7,My grief has almost made me blind; my arms and legs are as thin as shadows.
Job,17,8,"Those who claim to be honest are shocked, and they all condemn me as godless."
Job,17,9,Those who claim to be respectable are more and more convinced they are right.
Job,17,10,"But if all of them came and stood before me, I would not find even one of them wise."
Job,17,11,My days have passed; my plans have failed; my hope is gone.
Job,17,12,"But my friends say night is daylight; they say that light is near, but I know I remain in darkness."
Job,17,13,"My only hope is the world of the dead, where I will lie down to sleep in the dark."
Job,17,14,"I will call the grave my father, and the worms that eat me I will call my mother and my sisters."
Job,17,15,Where is there any hope for me? Who sees any?
Job,17,16,Hope will not go with me when I go down to the world of the dead.
Job,24,1,"Why doesn't God set a time for judging, a day of justice for those who serve him?"
Job,24,2,People move property lines to get more land; they steal sheep and put them with their own flocks.
Job,24,3,"They take donkeys that belong to orphans, and keep a widow's ox till she pays her debts."
Job,24,4,They prevent the poor from getting their rights and force the needy to run and hide.
Job,24,5,"So the poor, like wild donkeys, search for food in the dry wilderness; nowhere else can they find food for their children."
Job,24,6,"They have to harvest fields they don't own, and gather grapes in vineyards of the wicked."
Job,24,7,"At night they sleep with nothing to cover them, nothing to keep them from the cold."
Job,24,8,"They are drenched by the rain that falls on the mountains, and they huddle beside the rocks for shelter."
Job,24,9,Evil people make slaves of fatherless infants and take the children of the poor in payment for debts.
Job,24,10,But the poor must go out with no clothes to protect them; they must go hungry while harvesting wheat.
Job,24,11,"They press olives for oil, and grapes for wine, but they themselves are thirsty."
Job,24,12,"In the cities the wounded and dying cry out, but God ignores their prayers."
Job,24,13,There are those who reject the light; they don't understand it or go where it leads.
Job,24,14,"At dawn the murderer gets up and goes out to kill the poor, and at night he steals."
Job,24,15,The adulterer waits for twilight to come; he covers his face so that no one can see him.
Job,24,16,"At night thieves break into houses, but by day they hide and avoid the light."
Job,24,17,"They fear the light of day, but darkness holds no terror for them."
Job,24,18,"The wicked are swept away by floods, and the land they own is under God's curse; they no longer go to work in their vineyards."
Job,24,19,"As snow vanishes in heat and drought, so sinners vanish from the land of the living."
Job,24,20,Not even their mothers remember them now; they are eaten by worms and destroyed like fallen trees.
Job,24,21,That happens because they mistreated widows and showed no kindness to childless women.
Job,24,22,"God, in his strength, destroys the mighty; God acts—and the wicked die."
Job,24,23,"God may let them live secure, but keeps an eye on them all the time."
Job,24,24,"For a while the wicked prosper, but then they wither like weeds, like stalks of grain that have been cut down."
Job,24,25,Can anyone deny that this is so? Can anyone prove that my words are not true?
Job,28,1,There are mines where silver is dug; There are places where gold is refined.
Job,28,2,We dig iron out of the ground And melt copper out of the stones.
Job,28,3,Miners explore the deepest darkness. They search the depths of the earth And dig for rocks in the darkness.
Job,28,4,"Far from where anyone lives Or human feet ever travel, They dig the shafts of mines. There they work in loneliness, Clinging to ropes in the pits."
Job,28,5,"Food grows out of the earth, But underneath the same earth All is torn up and crushed."
Job,28,6,"The stones of the earth contain sapphires, And its dust contains gold."
Job,28,7,"No hawk sees the roads to the mines, And no vulture ever flies over them."
Job,28,8,No lion or other fierce beast Ever travels those lonely roads.
Job,28,9,"Miners dig the hardest rocks, Dig mountains away at their base."
Job,28,10,"As they tunnel through the rocks, They discover precious stones."
Job,28,11,They dig to the sources of rivers And bring to light what is hidden.
Job,28,12, But where can wisdom be found? Where can we learn to understand?
Job,28,13, Wisdom is not to be found among mortals; No one knows its true value.
Job,28,14,The depths of the oceans and seas Say that wisdom is not found there.
Job,28,15,It cannot be bought with silver or gold.
Job,28,16,The finest gold and jewels Cannot equal its value.
Job,28,17,"It is worth more than gold, Than a gold vase or finest glass."
Job,28,18,The value of wisdom is more Than coral or crystal or rubies.
Job,28,19,The finest topaz and the purest gold Cannot compare with the value of wisdom.
Job,28,20,"Where, then, is the source of wisdom? Where can we learn to understand?"
Job,28,21,"No living creature can see it, Not even a bird in flight."
Job,28,22,Even death and destruction Admit they have heard only rumors.
Job,28,23," God alone knows the way, Knows the place where wisdom is found,"
Job,28,24,"Because he sees the ends of the earth, Sees everything under the sky."
Job,28,25,When God gave the wind its power And determined the size of the sea;
Job,28,26,"When God decided where the rain would fall, And the path that the thunderclouds travel;"
Job,28,27, It was then he saw wisdom and tested its worth— He gave it his approval.
Job,28,28," God said to us humans, “To be wise, you must have reverence for the Lord. To understand, you must turn from evil.”"
Job,29,1,Job began speaking again.
Job,29,2,If only my life could once again be as it was when God watched over me.
Job,29,3,God was always with me then and gave me light as I walked through the darkness.
Job,29,4,"Those were the days when I was prosperous, and the friendship of God protected my home."
Job,29,5,"Almighty God was with me then, and I was surrounded by all my children."
Job,29,6,"My cows and goats gave plenty of milk, and my olive trees grew in the rockiest soil."
Job,29,7,"Whenever the city elders met and I took my place among them,"
Job,29,8,"young men stepped aside as soon as they saw me, and old men stood up to show me respect."
Job,29,9,The leaders of the people would stop talking;
Job,29,10,even the most important men kept silent.
Job,29,11,Everyone who saw me or heard of me had good things to say about what I had done.
Job,29,12,"When the poor cried out, I helped them; I gave help to orphans who had nowhere to turn."
Job,29,13,"People who were in deepest misery praised me, and I helped widows find security."
Job,29,14,I have always acted justly and fairly.
Job,29,15,"I was eyes for the blind, and feet for the lame."
Job,29,16,I was like a father to the poor and took the side of strangers in trouble.
Job,29,17,I destroyed the power of cruel men and rescued their victims.
Job,29,18,I always expected to live a long life and to die at home in comfort.
Job,29,19,I was like a tree whose roots always have water and whose branches are wet with dew.
Job,29,20,"Everyone was always praising me, and my strength never failed me."
Job,29,21,"When I gave advice, people were silent and listened carefully to what I said;"
Job,29,22,they had nothing to add when I had finished. My words sank in like drops of rain;
Job,29,23,everyone welcomed them just as farmers welcome rain in spring.
Job,29,24,I smiled on them when they had lost confidence; my cheerful face encouraged them.
Job,29,25,"I took charge and made the decisions; I led them as a king leads his troops, and gave them comfort in their despair."
Job,30,1,But men younger than I am make fun of me now! Their fathers have always been so worthless that I wouldn't let them help my dogs guard sheep.
Job,30,2,"They were a bunch of worn-out men, too weak to do any work for me."
Job,30,3,"They were so poor and hungry that they would gnaw dry roots— at night, in wild, desolate places."
Job,30,4,"They pulled up the plants of the desert and ate them, even the tasteless roots of the broom tree!"
Job,30,5,"Everyone drove them away with shouts, as if they were shouting at thieves."
Job,30,6,"They had to live in caves, in holes dug in the sides of cliffs."
Job,30,7,Out in the wilds they howled like animals and huddled together under the bushes.
Job,30,8,A worthless bunch of nameless nobodies! They were driven out of the land.
Job,30,9,Now they come and laugh at me; I am nothing but a joke to them.
Job,30,10,"They treat me with disgust; they think they are too good for me, and even come and spit in my face."
Job,30,11,"Because God has made me weak and helpless, they turn against me with all their fury."
Job,30,12,This mob attacks me head-on; they send me running; they prepare their final assault.
Job,30,13,They cut off my escape and try to destroy me; and there is no one to stop them.
Job,30,14,They pour through the holes in my defenses and come crashing down on top of me;
Job,30,15,"I am overcome with terror; my dignity is gone like a puff of wind, and my prosperity like a cloud."
Job,30,16,Now I am about to die; there is no relief for my suffering.
Job,30,17,At night my bones all ache; the pain that gnaws me never stops.
Job,30,18,God seizes me by my collar and twists my clothes out of shape.
Job,30,19,He throws me down in the mud; I am no better than dirt.
Job,30,20,"I call to you, O God, but you never answer; and when I pray, you pay no attention."
Job,30,21,You are treating me cruelly; you persecute me with all your power.
Job,30,22,You let the wind blow me away; you toss me about in a raging storm.
Job,30,23,"I know you are taking me off to my death, to the fate in store for everyone."
Job,30,24,"Why do you attack a ruined man, one who can do nothing but beg for pity?"
Job,30,25,Didn't I weep with people in trouble and feel sorry for those in need?
Job,30,26,"I hoped for happiness and light, but trouble and darkness came instead."
Job,30,27,I am torn apart by worry and pain; I have had day after day of suffering.
Job,30,28,"I go about in gloom, without any sunshine; I stand up in public and plead for help."
Job,30,29,My voice is as sad and lonely as the cries of a jackal or an ostrich.
Job,30,30,My skin has turned dark; I am burning with fever.
Job,30,31,"Where once I heard joyful music, now I hear only mourning and weeping."
Job,31,1,I have made a solemn promise never to look with lust at a woman.
Job,31,2,What does Almighty God do to us? How does he repay human deeds?
Job,31,3,He sends disaster and ruin to those who do wrong.
Job,31,4,God knows everything I do; he sees every step I take.
Job,31,5,I swear I have never acted wickedly and never tried to deceive others.
Job,31,6,"Let God weigh me on honest scales, and he will see how innocent I am."
Job,31,7,"If I have turned from the right path or let myself be attracted to evil, if my hands are stained with sin,"
Job,31,8,"then let my crops be destroyed, or let others eat the food I grow."
Job,31,9,"If I have been attracted to my neighbor's wife, and waited, hidden, outside her door,"
Job,31,10,then let my wife cook another man's food and sleep in another man's bed.
Job,31,11,Such wickedness should be punished by death.
Job,31,12,"It would be like a destructive, hellish fire, consuming everything I have."
Job,31,13,"When any of my servants complained against me, I would listen and treat them fairly."
Job,31,14,"If I did not, how could I then face God? What could I say when God came to judge me?"
Job,31,15,The same God who created me created my servants also.
Job,31,16, I have never refused to help the poor; never have I let widows live in despair
Job,31,17,or let orphans go hungry while I ate.
Job,31,18,All my life I have taken care of them.
Job,31,19,"When I found someone in need, too poor to buy clothes,"
Job,31,20,I would give him clothing made of wool that had come from my own flock of sheep. Then he would praise me with all his heart.
Job,31,21,"If I have ever cheated an orphan, knowing I could win in court,"
Job,31,22,then may my arms be broken; may they be torn from my shoulders.
Job,31,23,"Because I fear God's punishment, I could never do such a thing."
Job,31,24, I have never trusted in riches
Job,31,25,or taken pride in my wealth.
Job,31,26,I have never worshiped the sun in its brightness or the moon in all its beauty.
Job,31,27,I have not been led astray to honor them by kissing my hand in reverence to them.
Job,31,28,Such a sin should be punished by death; it denies Almighty God.
Job,31,29,"I have never been glad when my enemies suffered, or pleased when they met with disaster;"
Job,31,30,I never sinned by praying for their death.
Job,31,31,All those who work for me know that I have always welcomed strangers.
Job,31,32,I invited travelers into my home and never let them sleep in the streets.
Job,31,33,"Others try to hide their sins, but I have never concealed mine."
Job,31,34,I have never feared what people would say; I have never kept quiet or stayed indoors because I feared their scorn.
Job,31,35,"Will no one listen to what I am saying? I swear that every word is true. Let Almighty God answer me. If the charges my opponent brings against me were written down so that I could see them,"
Job,31,36,I would wear them proudly on my shoulder and place them on my head like a crown.
Job,31,37,"I would tell God everything I have done, and hold my head high in his presence."
Job,31,38,If I have stolen the land I farm and taken it from its rightful owners—
Job,31,39,if I have eaten the food that grew there but let the farmers that grew it starve—
Job,31,40,"then instead of wheat and barley, may weeds and thistles grow. The words of Job are ended."
Job,32,1,"Because Job was convinced of his own innocence, the three men gave up trying to answer him."
Job,32,2,"But a bystander named Elihu could not control his anger any longer, because Job was justifying himself and blaming God. (Elihu was the son of Barakel, a descendant of Buz, and belonged to the clan of Ram.)"
Job,32,3,"He was also angry with Job's three friends. They could not find any way to answer Job, and this made it appear that God was in the wrong."
Job,32,4,"Because Elihu was the youngest one there, he had waited until everyone finished speaking."
Job,32,5,"When he saw that the three men could not answer Job, he was angry"
Job,32,6,"and began to speak. I am young, and you are old, so I was afraid to tell you what I think."
Job,32,7,"I told myself that you ought to speak, that you older men should share your wisdom."
Job,32,8,But it is the spirit of Almighty God that comes to us and gives us wisdom.
Job,32,9,It is not growing old that makes us wise or helps us to know what is right.
Job,32,10,So now I want you to listen to me; let me tell you what I think.
Job,32,11,I listened patiently while you were speaking and waited while you searched for wise phrases.
Job,32,12,I paid close attention and heard you fail; you have not disproved what Job has said.
Job,32,13,"How can you claim you have discovered wisdom? God must answer Job, for you have failed."
Job,32,14,"Job was speaking to you, not to me, but I would never answer the way you did."
Job,32,15,"Words have failed them, Job; they have no answer for you."
Job,32,16,Shall I go on waiting when they are silent? They stand there with nothing more to say.
Job,32,17,"No, I will give my own answer now and tell you what I think."
Job,32,18,I can hardly wait to speak. I can't hold back the words.
Job,32,19,"If I don't get a chance to speak, I will burst like a wineskin full of new wine."
Job,32,20,I can't stand it; I have to speak.
Job,32,21,I will not take sides in this debate; I am not going to flatter anyone.
Job,32,22,"I don't know how to flatter, and God would quickly punish me if I did."
Job,33,1,"And now, Job, listen carefully to all that I have to say."
Job,33,2,I am ready to say what's on my mind.
Job,33,3,"All my words are sincere, and I am speaking the truth."
Job,33,4,God's spirit made me and gave me life.
Job,33,5,Answer me if you can. Prepare your arguments.
Job,33,6,"You and I are the same in God's sight, both of us were formed from clay."
Job,33,7,So you have no reason to fear me; I will not overpower you.
Job,33,8,Now this is what I heard you say:
Job,33,9,“I am not guilty; I have done nothing wrong. I am innocent and free from sin.
Job,33,10,But God finds excuses for attacking me and treats me like an enemy.
Job,33,11, He binds chains on my feet; he watches every move I make.”
Job,33,12,"But I tell you, Job, you are wrong. God is greater than any human being."
Job,33,13,Why do you accuse God of never answering our complaints?
Job,33,14,"Although God speaks again and again, no one pays attention to what he says."
Job,33,15," At night when people are asleep, God speaks in dreams and visions."
Job,33,16,"He makes them listen to what he says, and they are frightened at his warnings."
Job,33,17,God speaks to make them stop their sinning and to save them from becoming proud.
Job,33,18,He will not let them be destroyed; he saves them from death itself.
Job,33,19,God corrects us by sending sickness and filling our bodies with pain.
Job,33,20,"Those who are sick lose their appetites, and even the finest food looks revolting."
Job,33,21,Their bodies waste away to nothing; you can see all their bones;
Job,33,22,they are about to go to the world of the dead.
Job,33,23,"Perhaps an angel may come to their aid— one of God's thousands of angels, who remind us of our duty."
Job,33,24,"In mercy the angel will say, “Release them! They are not to go down to the world of the dead. Here is the ransom to set them free.”"
Job,33,25,Their bodies will grow young and strong again;
Job,33,26,"when they pray, God will answer; they will worship God with joy; God will set things right for them again."
Job,33,27,"Each one will say in public, “I have sinned. I have not done right, but God spared me."
Job,33,28,"He kept me from going to the world of the dead, and I am still alive.”"
Job,33,29,God does all this again and again;
Job,33,30,"each one saves a person's life, and gives him the joy of living."
Job,33,31,"Now, Job, listen to what I am saying; be quiet and let me speak."
Job,33,32,"But if you have something to say, let me hear it; I would gladly admit you are in the right."
Job,33,33,"But if not, be quiet and listen to me, and I will teach you how to be wise."
Job,37,1,The storm makes my heart beat wildly.
Job,37,2,"Listen, all of you, to the voice of God, to the thunder that comes from his mouth."
Job,37,3,"He sends the lightning across the sky, from one end of the earth to the other."
Job,37,4,"Then the roar of his voice is heard, the majestic sound of thunder, and all the while the lightning flashes."
Job,37,5,"At God's command amazing things happen, wonderful things that we can't understand."
Job,37,6,"He commands snow to fall on the earth, and sends torrents of drenching rain."
Job,37,7,He brings our work to a stop; he shows us what he can do.
Job,37,8,The wild animals go to their dens.
Job,37,9,"The storm winds come from the south, and the biting cold from the north."
Job,37,10,"The breath of God freezes the waters, and turns them to solid ice."
Job,37,11,"Lightning flashes from the clouds,"
Job,37,12,"as they move at God's will. They do all that God commands, everywhere throughout the world."
Job,37,13,"God sends rain to water the earth; he may send it to punish us, or to show us his favor."
Job,37,14,"Pause a moment, Job, and listen; consider the wonderful things God does."
Job,37,15,Do you know how God gives the command and makes lightning flash from the clouds?
Job,37,16,"Do you know how clouds float in the sky, the work of God's amazing skill?"
Job,37,17,"No, you can only suffer in the heat when the south wind oppresses the land."
Job,37,18,Can you help God stretch out the sky and make it as hard as polished metal?
Job,37,19,Teach us what to say to God; our minds are blank; we have nothing to say.
Job,37,20,I won't ask to speak with God; why should I give him a chance to destroy me?
Job,37,21,"And now the light in the sky is dazzling, too bright for us to look at it; and the sky has been swept clean by the wind."
Job,37,22,"A golden glow is seen in the north, and the glory of God fills us with awe."
Job,37,23,God's power is so great that we cannot come near him; he is righteous and just in his dealings with us.
Job,37,24,"No wonder, then, that everyone is awed by him, and that he ignores those who claim to be wise."
Job,38,1,Then out of the storm the Lord spoke to Job.
Job,38,2,"Who are you to question my wisdom with your ignorant, empty words?"
Job,38,3,Now stand up straight and answer the questions I ask you.
Job,38,4,"Were you there when I made the world? If you know so much, tell me about it."
Job,38,5,Who decided how large it would be? Who stretched the measuring line over it? Do you know all the answers?
Job,38,6,What holds up the pillars that support the earth? Who laid the cornerstone of the world?
Job,38,7," In the dawn of that day the stars sang together, and the heavenly beings shouted for joy."
Job,38,8, Who closed the gates to hold back the sea when it burst from the womb of the earth?
Job,38,9,It was I who covered the sea with clouds and wrapped it in darkness.
Job,38,10,I marked a boundary for the sea and kept it behind bolted gates.
Job,38,11,"I told it, “So far and no farther! Here your powerful waves must stop.”"
Job,38,12,"Job, have you ever in all your life commanded a day to dawn?"
Job,38,13,Have you ordered the dawn to seize the earth and shake the wicked from their hiding places?
Job,38,14,"Daylight makes the hills and valleys stand out like the folds of a garment, clear as the imprint of a seal on clay."
Job,38,15,The light of day is too bright for the wicked and restrains them from doing violence.
Job,38,16,Have you been to the springs in the depths of the sea? Have you walked on the floor of the ocean?
Job,38,17,Has anyone ever shown you the gates that guard the dark world of the dead?
Job,38,18,Have you any idea how big the world is? Answer me if you know.
Job,38,19,Do you know where the light comes from or what the source of darkness is?
Job,38,20,"Can you show them how far to go, or send them back again?"
Job,38,21,"I am sure you can, because you're so old and were there when the world was made!"
Job,38,22,"Have you ever visited the storerooms, where I keep the snow and the hail?"
Job,38,23,"I keep them ready for times of trouble, for days of battle and war."
Job,38,24,"Have you been to the place where the sun comes up, or the place from which the east wind blows?"
Job,38,25,Who dug a channel for the pouring rain and cleared the way for the thunderstorm?
Job,38,26,Who makes rain fall where no one lives?
Job,38,27,"Who waters the dry and thirsty land, so that grass springs up?"
Job,38,28,Does either the rain or the dew have a father?
Job,38,29,"Who is the mother of the ice and the frost,"
Job,38,30,which turn the waters to stone and freeze the face of the sea?
Job,38,31, Can you tie the Pleiades together or loosen the bonds that hold Orion?
Job,38,32,Can you guide the stars season by season and direct the Big and the Little Dipper?
Job,38,33,"Do you know the laws that govern the skies, and can you make them apply to the earth?"
Job,38,34,Can you shout orders to the clouds and make them drench you with rain?
Job,38,35,"And if you command the lightning to flash, will it come to you and say, “At your service”?"
Job,38,36,"Who tells the ibis when the Nile will flood, or who tells the rooster that rain will fall?"
Job,38,37,"Who is wise enough to count the clouds and tilt them over to pour out the rain,"
Job,38,38,rain that hardens the dust into lumps?
Job,38,39,"Do you find food for lions to eat, and satisfy hungry young lions"
Job,38,40,"when they hide in their caves, or lie in wait in their dens?"
Job,38,41,"Who is it that feeds the ravens when they wander about hungry, when their young cry to me for food?"
Job,39,1,Do you know when mountain goats are born? Have you watched wild deer give birth?
Job,39,2,Do you know how long they carry their young? Do you know the time for their birth?
Job,39,3,Do you know when they will crouch down and bring their young into the world?
Job,39,4,In the wilds their young grow strong; they go away and don't come back.
Job,39,5,Who gave the wild donkeys their freedom? Who turned them loose and let them roam?
Job,39,6,"I gave them the desert to be their home, and let them live on the salt plains."
Job,39,7,"They keep far away from the noisy cities, and no one can tame them and make them work."
Job,39,8,"The mountains are the pastures where they feed, where they search for anything green to eat."
Job,39,9,Will a wild ox work for you? Is he willing to spend the night in your stable?
Job,39,10,Can you hold one with a rope and make him plow? Or make him pull a harrow in your fields?
Job,39,11,Can you rely on his great strength and expect him to do your heavy work?
Job,39,12,Do you expect him to bring in your harvest and gather the grain from your threshing place?
Job,39,13,How fast the wings of an ostrich beat! But no ostrich can fly like a stork.
Job,39,14,The ostrich leaves her eggs on the ground for the heat in the soil to warm them.
Job,39,15,She is unaware that a foot may crush them or a wild animal break them.
Job,39,16,"She acts as if the eggs were not hers, and is unconcerned that her efforts were wasted."
Job,39,17,It was I who made her foolish and did not give her wisdom.
Job,39,18,"But when she begins to run, she can laugh at any horse and rider."
Job,39,19,"Was it you, Job, who made horses so strong and gave them their flowing manes?"
Job,39,20,Did you make them leap like locusts and frighten people with their snorting?
Job,39,21,They eagerly paw the ground in the valley; they rush into battle with all their strength.
Job,39,22,"They do not know the meaning of fear, and no sword can turn them back."
Job,39,23,The weapons which their riders carry rattle and flash in the sun.
Job,39,24,"Trembling with excitement, the horses race ahead; when the trumpet blows, they can't stand still."
Job,39,25,"At each blast of the trumpet they snort; they can smell a battle before they get near, and they hear the officers shouting commands."
Job,39,26,Does a hawk learn from you how to fly when it spreads its wings toward the south?
Job,39,27,Does an eagle wait for your command to build its nest high in the mountains?
Job,39,28,It makes its home on the highest rocks and makes the sharp peaks its fortress.
Job,39,29,From there it watches near and far for something to kill and eat.
Job,39,30," Around dead bodies the eagles gather, and the young eagles drink the blood."
Job,41,1, Can you catch Leviathan with a fishhook or tie his tongue down with a rope?
Job,41,2,Can you put a rope through his snout or put a hook through his jaws?
Job,41,3,Will he beg you to let him go? Will he plead with you for mercy?
Job,41,4,Will he make an agreement with you and promise to serve you forever?
Job,41,5,"Will you tie him like a pet bird, like something to amuse your servant women?"
Job,41,6,Will fishermen bargain over him? Will merchants cut him up to sell?
Job,41,7,Can you fill his hide with fishing spears or pierce his head with a harpoon?
Job,41,8,Touch him once and you'll never try it again; you'll never forget the fight!
Job,41,9,Anyone who sees Leviathan loses courage and falls to the ground.
Job,41,10,"When he is aroused, he is fierce; no one would dare to stand before him."
Job,41,11,Who can attack him and still be safe? No one in all the world can do it.
Job,41,12,Let me tell you about Leviathan's legs and describe how great and strong he is.
Job,41,13,No one can tear off his outer coat or pierce the armor he wears.
Job,41,14,"Who can make him open his jaws, ringed with those terrifying teeth?"
Job,41,15,"His back is made of rows of shields, fastened together and hard as stone."
Job,41,16,"Each one is joined so tight to the next, not even a breath can come between."
Job,41,17,They all are fastened so firmly together that nothing can ever pull them apart.
Job,41,18,"Light flashes when he sneezes, and his eyes glow like the rising sun."
Job,41,19,"Flames blaze from his mouth, and streams of sparks fly out."
Job,41,20,"Smoke comes pouring out of his nose, like smoke from weeds burning under a pot."
Job,41,21,His breath starts fires burning; flames leap out of his mouth.
Job,41,22,His neck is so powerful that all who meet him are terrified.
Job,41,23,There is not a weak spot in his skin; it is as hard and unyielding as iron.
Job,41,24,"His stony heart is without fear, as unyielding and hard as a millstone."
Job,41,25,"When he rises up, even the strongest are frightened; they are helpless with fear."
Job,41,26,There is no sword that can wound him; no spear or arrow or lance that can harm him.
Job,41,27,"For him iron is as flimsy as straw, and bronze as soft as rotten wood."
Job,41,28,There is no arrow that can make him run; rocks thrown at him are like bits of straw.
Job,41,29,"To him a club is a piece of straw, and he laughs when men throw spears."
Job,41,30,The scales on his belly are like jagged pieces of pottery; they tear up the muddy ground like a threshing sledge.
Job,41,31,He churns up the sea like boiling water and makes it bubble like a pot of oil.
Job,41,32,He leaves a shining path behind him and turns the sea to white foam.
Job,41,33,There is nothing on earth to compare with him; he is a creature that has no fear.
Job,41,34,He looks down on even the proudest animals; he is king of all wild beasts.
Job,42,1,Then Job answered the Lord.
Job,42,2,"I know, Lord , that you are all-powerful; that you can do everything you want."
Job,42,3," You ask how I dare question your wisdom when I am so very ignorant. I talked about things I did not understand, about marvels too great for me to know."
Job,42,4, You told me to listen while you spoke and to try to answer your questions.
Job,42,5,"In the past I knew only what others had told me, but now I have seen you with my own eyes."
Job,42,6,So I am ashamed of all I have said and repent in dust and ashes.
Job,42,7,"After the Lord had finished speaking to Job, he said to Eliphaz, “I am angry with you and your two friends, because you did not speak the truth about me, the way my servant Job did."
Job,42,8,"Now take seven bulls and seven rams to Job and offer them as a sacrifice for yourselves. Job will pray for you, and I will answer his prayer and not disgrace you the way you deserve. You did not speak the truth about me as he did.”"
Job,42,9,"Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar did what the Lord had told them to do, and the Lord answered Job's prayer."
Job,42,10," Then, after Job had prayed for his three friends, the Lord made him prosperous again and gave him twice as much as he had had before."
Job,42,11,All Job's brothers and sisters and former friends came to visit him and feasted with him in his house. They expressed their sympathy and comforted him for all the troubles the Lord had brought on him. Each of them gave him some money and a gold ring.
Job,42,12,"The Lord blessed the last part of Job's life even more than he had blessed the first. Job owned fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, two thousand head of cattle, and one thousand donkeys."
Job,42,13,He was the father of seven sons and three daughters.
Job,42,14,"He called the oldest daughter Jemimah, the second Keziah, and the youngest Keren Happuch."
Job,42,15,There were no other women in the whole world as beautiful as Job's daughters. Their father gave them a share of the inheritance along with their brothers.
Job,42,16,"Job lived a hundred and forty years after this, long enough to see his grandchildren and great-grandchildren."
Job,42,17,And then he died at a very great age.
