2 Chronicles,1,1,"Solomon, the son of King David, took firm control of the kingdom of Israel, and the Lord his God blessed him and made him very powerful."
2 Chronicles,1,2,"King Solomon gave an order to all the officers in charge of units of a thousand men and of a hundred men, all the government officials, all the heads of families, and all the rest of the people,"
2 Chronicles,1,3,"commanding them to go with him to the place of worship at Gibeon. They went there because that was where the Tent of the Lord 's presence was located, which Moses, the Lord 's servant, had made in the wilderness. ("
2 Chronicles,1,4,"The Covenant Box, however, was in Jerusalem, kept in a tent which King David had set up when he brought the Box from Kiriath Jearim.)"
2 Chronicles,1,5,"The bronze altar which had been made by Bezalel, the son of Uri and grandson of Hur, was also in Gibeon in front of the Tent of the Lord 's presence. King Solomon and all the people worshiped the Lord there."
2 Chronicles,1,6,In front of the Tent the king worshiped the Lord by offering sacrifices on the bronze altar; he had a thousand animals killed and burned whole on it.
2 Chronicles,1,7,"That night God appeared to Solomon and asked, “What would you like me to give you?”"
2 Chronicles,1,8,"Solomon answered, “You always showed great love for my father David, and now you have let me succeed him as king."
2 Chronicles,1,9,"O Lord God, fulfill the promise you made to my father. You have made me king over a people who are so many that they cannot be counted,"
2 Chronicles,1,10,"so give me the wisdom and knowledge I need to rule over them. Otherwise, how would I ever be able to rule this great people of yours?”"
2 Chronicles,1,11,"God replied to Solomon, “You have made the right choice. Instead of asking for wealth or treasure or fame or the death of your enemies or even for long life for yourself, you have asked for wisdom and knowledge so that you can rule my people, over whom I have made you king."
2 Chronicles,1,12,"I will give you wisdom and knowledge. And in addition, I will give you more wealth, treasure, and fame than any king has ever had before or will ever have again.”"
2 Chronicles,1,13,"So Solomon left the place of worship at Gibeon, where the Tent of the Lord 's presence was, and returned to Jerusalem. There he ruled over Israel."
2 Chronicles,1,14,"He built up a force of fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand cavalry horses. Some of them he kept in Jerusalem, and the rest he stationed in various other cities."
2 Chronicles,1,15,"During his reign silver and gold became as common in Jerusalem as stone, and cedar was as plentiful as ordinary sycamore in the foothills of Judah."
2 Chronicles,1,16,"The king's agents controlled the export of horses from Musri and Cilicia,"
2 Chronicles,1,17,"and the export of chariots from Egypt. They supplied the Hittite and Syrian kings with horses and chariots, selling chariots for 600 pieces of silver each and horses for 150 each."
2 Chronicles,2,1,"King Solomon decided to build a temple where the Lord would be worshiped, and also to build a palace for himself."
2 Chronicles,2,2,"He put 70,000 men to work transporting materials, and 80,000 to work cutting stone in the hill country. There were 3,600 others responsible for supervising the work."
2 Chronicles,2,3,"Solomon sent a message to King Hiram of Tyre: “Do business with me as you did with my father, King David, when you sold him cedar logs for building his palace."
2 Chronicles,2,4,"I am building a temple to honor the Lord my God. It will be a holy place where my people and I will worship him by burning incense of fragrant spices, where we will present offerings of sacred bread to him continuously, and where we will offer burnt offerings every morning and evening, as well as on Sabbaths, New Moon Festivals, and other holy days honoring the Lord our God. He has commanded Israel to do this forever."
2 Chronicles,2,5,"I intend to build a great temple, because our God is greater than any other god."
2 Chronicles,2,6,"Yet no one can really build a temple for God, because even all the vastness of heaven cannot contain him. How then can I build a temple that would be anything more than a place to burn incense to God?"
2 Chronicles,2,7,"Now send me a man with skill in engraving, in working gold, silver, bronze, and iron, and in making blue, purple, and red cloth. He will work with the craftsmen of Judah and Jerusalem whom my father David selected."
2 Chronicles,2,8,"I know how skillful your lumbermen are, so send me cedar, cypress, and juniper logs from Lebanon. I am ready to send my men to assist yours"
2 Chronicles,2,9,"in preparing large quantities of timber, because this temple I intend to build will be large and magnificent."
2 Chronicles,2,10,"As provisions for your lumbermen, I will send you 100,000 bushels of wheat, 100,000 bushels of barley, 110,000 gallons of wine, and 110,000 gallons of olive oil.”"
2 Chronicles,2,11,"King Hiram sent Solomon a letter in reply. He wrote, “Because the Lord loves his people, he has made you their king."
2 Chronicles,2,12,"Praise the Lord God of Israel, Creator of heaven and earth! He has given King David a wise son, full of understanding and skill, who now plans to build a temple for the Lord and a palace for himself."
2 Chronicles,2,13,I am sending you a wise and skillful master metalworker named Huram.
2 Chronicles,2,14,"His mother was a member of the tribe of Dan and his father was a native of Tyre. He knows how to make things out of gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone, and wood. He can work with blue, purple, and red cloth, and with linen. He can do all sorts of engraving and can follow any design suggested to him. Let him work with your skilled workers and with those who worked for your father, King David."
2 Chronicles,2,15,"So now send us the wheat, barley, wine, and olive oil that you promised."
2 Chronicles,2,16,"In the mountains of Lebanon we will cut down all the cedars you need, tie them together in rafts, and float them by sea as far as Joppa. From there you can take them to Jerusalem.”"
2 Chronicles,2,17,"King Solomon took a census of all the foreigners living in the land of Israel, similar to the census his father David had taken. There were 153,600 resident foreigners."
2 Chronicles,2,18,"He assigned 70,000 of them to transport materials and 80,000 to cut stones in the mountains, and appointed 3,600 supervisors to make sure the work was done."
2 Chronicles,3,1," King David, Solomon's father, had already prepared a place for the Temple. It was in Jerusalem, on Mount Moriah, where the Lord appeared to David, at the place which Araunah the Jebusite had used as a threshing place. King Solomon began the construction"
2 Chronicles,3,2,in the second month of the fourth year that he was king.
2 Chronicles,3,3,The Temple which King Solomon built was 90 feet long and 30 feet wide.
2 Chronicles,3,4,"The entrance room was the full width of the Temple, 30 feet, and was 180 feet high. The inside of the room was overlaid with pure gold."
2 Chronicles,3,5,"The main room was paneled with cedar and overlaid with fine gold, in which were worked designs of palm trees and chain patterns."
2 Chronicles,3,6,The king decorated the Temple with beautiful precious stones and with gold imported from the land of Parvaim.
2 Chronicles,3,7,"He used the gold to overlay the Temple walls, the rafters, the entryways, and the doors. On the walls the workers carved designs of winged creatures."
2 Chronicles,3,8,"The inner room, called the Most Holy Place, was 30 feet long and 30 feet wide, which was the full width of the Temple. Twenty-five tons of gold were used to cover the walls of the Most Holy Place;"
2 Chronicles,3,9,"twenty ounces of gold were used for making nails, and the walls of the upper rooms were also covered with gold."
2 Chronicles,3,10," The king also had his workers make two winged creatures out of metal, cover them with gold, and place them in the Most Holy Place,"
2 Chronicles,4,1," King Solomon had a bronze altar made, which was 30 feet square and 15 feet high."
2 Chronicles,4,2,"He also made a round tank of bronze, 7½ feet deep, 15 feet in diameter, and 45 feet in circumference."
2 Chronicles,4,3,"All around the outer edge of the rim of the tank were two rows of decorations, one above the other. The decorations were in the shape of bulls, which had been cast all in one piece with the rest of the tank."
2 Chronicles,4,4,"The tank rested on the backs of twelve bronze bulls that faced outward, three facing in each direction."
2 Chronicles,4,5,"The sides of the tank were 3 inches thick. Its rim was like the rim of a cup, curving outward like the petals of a flower. The tank held about 15,000 gallons."
2 Chronicles,4,6,"They also made ten basins, five to be placed on the south side of the Temple and five on the north side. They were to be used to rinse the parts of the animals that were burned as sacrifices. The water in the large tank was for the priests to use for washing."
2 Chronicles,5,1," When King Solomon finished all the work on the Temple, he placed in the Temple storerooms all the things that his father David had dedicated to the Lord —the silver, gold, and other articles."
2 Chronicles,5,2," Then King Solomon summoned all the leaders of the tribes and clans of Israel to assemble in Jerusalem, in order to take the Lord 's Covenant Box from Zion, David's City, to the Temple."
2 Chronicles,5,3,They all assembled at the time of the Festival of Shelters.
2 Chronicles,5,4,"When all the leaders had gathered, then the Levites lifted the Covenant Box"
2 Chronicles,5,5,and carried it to the Temple. The priests and the Levites also moved the Tent of the Lord 's presence and all its equipment to the Temple.
2 Chronicles,5,6,King Solomon and all the people of Israel assembled in front of the Covenant Box and sacrificed a large number of sheep and cattle—too many to count.
2 Chronicles,5,7,"Then the priests carried the Covenant Box of the Lord into the Temple and put it in the Most Holy Place, beneath the winged creatures."
2 Chronicles,5,8,Their outstretched wings covered the Box and the poles it was carried by.
2 Chronicles,5,9,"The ends of the poles could be seen by anyone standing directly in front of the Most Holy Place, but from nowhere else. (The poles are still there today.)"
2 Chronicles,5,10,"There was nothing inside the Covenant Box except the two stone tablets which Moses had placed there at Mount Sinai, when the Lord made a covenant with the people of Israel as they were coming from Egypt."
2 Chronicles,6,1,"Then King Solomon prayed, “ Lord , you have chosen to live in clouds and darkness."
2 Chronicles,6,2,"Now I have built a majestic temple for you, a place for you to live in forever.”"
2 Chronicles,6,3,All the people of Israel were standing there. The king turned to face them and asked God's blessing on them.
2 Chronicles,6,4,"He said, “Praise the Lord God of Israel! He has kept the promise he made to my father David when he said to him,"
2 Chronicles,6,5,"‘From the time I brought my people out of Egypt until now, I did not choose any city in the land of Israel as the place to build a temple where I would be worshiped, and I did not choose anyone to lead my people Israel."
2 Chronicles,6,6,"But now I have chosen Jerusalem as the place where I will be worshiped, and you, David, to rule my people.’”"
2 Chronicles,6,7,"And Solomon continued, “My father David planned to build a temple for the worship of the Lord God of Israel,"
2 Chronicles,6,8,"but the Lord said to him, ‘You were right in wanting to build a temple for me,"
2 Chronicles,6,9,"but you will never build it. It is your son, your own son, who will build my temple.’"
2 Chronicles,6,10,"“Now the Lord has kept his promise: I have succeeded my father as king of Israel, and I have built a temple for the worship of the Lord God of Israel."
2 Chronicles,6,11,"I have placed in the Temple the Covenant Box, which contains the stone tablets of the covenant which the Lord made with the people of Israel.”"
2 Chronicles,6,12,Then in the presence of the people Solomon went and stood in front of the altar and raised his arms in prayer. (
2 Chronicles,6,13,"Solomon had made a bronze platform and put it in the middle of the courtyard. It was eight feet square and five feet high. He mounted this platform, knelt down where everyone could see him, and raised his hands toward heaven.)"
2 Chronicles,6,14,"He prayed, “ Lord God of Israel, in all heaven and earth there is no god like you. You keep your covenant with your people and show them your love when they live in wholehearted obedience to you."
2 Chronicles,6,15,You have kept the promise you made to my father David; today every word has been fulfilled.
2 Chronicles,6,16,"Now, Lord God of Israel, keep the other promise you made to my father when you told him that there would always be one of his descendants ruling as king of Israel, provided that they carefully obeyed your Law just as he did."
2 Chronicles,6,17,"So now, Lord God of Israel, let everything come true that you promised to your servant David."
2 Chronicles,6,18," “But can you, O God, really live on earth among men and women? Not even all of heaven is large enough to hold you, so how can this Temple that I have built be large enough?"
2 Chronicles,6,19,"Lord my God, I am your servant. Listen to my prayer and grant the requests I make to you."
2 Chronicles,6,20,"Watch over this Temple day and night. You have promised that this is where you will be worshiped, so hear me when I face this Temple and pray."
2 Chronicles,6,21,Hear my prayers and the prayers of your people Israel when they face this place and pray. In your home in heaven hear us and forgive us.
2 Chronicles,6,22,"“When people are accused of wronging others and are brought to your altar in this Temple to take an oath that they are innocent,"
2 Chronicles,6,23,"O Lord , listen in heaven and judge your servants. Punish the guilty ones as they deserve and acquit the innocent."
2 Chronicles,6,24,"“When your people Israel are defeated by their enemies because they have sinned against you and then when they turn to you and come to this Temple, humbly praying to you for forgiveness,"
2 Chronicles,6,25,listen to them in heaven. Forgive the sins of your people and bring them back to the land which you gave to them and to their ancestors.
2 Chronicles,6,26,"“When you hold back the rain because your people have sinned against you and then when they repent and face this Temple, humbly praying to you,"
2 Chronicles,6,27,"O Lord , listen to them in heaven and forgive the sins of your servants, the people of Israel, and teach them to do what is right. Then, O Lord , send rain on this land of yours, which you gave to your people as a permanent possession."
2 Chronicles,6,28,"“When there is famine in the land or an epidemic or the crops are destroyed by scorching winds or swarms of locusts, or when your people are attacked by their enemies, or when there is disease or sickness among them,"
2 Chronicles,6,29,"listen to their prayers. If any of your people Israel, out of heartfelt sorrow, stretch out their hands in prayer toward this Temple,"
2 Chronicles,6,30,"hear their prayer. Listen to them in your home in heaven and forgive them. You alone know the thoughts of the human heart. Deal with each of us as we deserve,"
2 Chronicles,6,31,so that your people may honor you and obey you all the time they live in the land which you gave to our ancestors.
2 Chronicles,6,32,"“When foreigners who live in a distant land hear how great and powerful you are and how you are always ready to act, and then they come to pray at this Temple,"
2 Chronicles,6,33,"listen to their prayers. In heaven, where you live, hear them and do what they ask you to do, so that all the peoples of the world may know you and obey you, as your people Israel do. Then they will know that this Temple I have built is where you are to be worshiped."
2 Chronicles,6,34,"“When you command your people to go into battle against their enemies and they pray to you, wherever they are, facing this city which you have chosen and this Temple which I have built for you,"
2 Chronicles,6,35,listen to their prayers. Hear them in heaven and give them victory.
2 Chronicles,6,36,"“When your people sin against you—and there is no one who does not sin—and in your anger you let their enemies defeat them and take them as prisoners to some other land, even if that land is far away,"
2 Chronicles,6,37,"listen to your people's prayers. If there in that land they repent and pray to you, confessing how sinful and wicked they have been, hear their prayers, O Lord."
2 Chronicles,6,38,"If in that land they truly and sincerely repent and pray to you as they face toward this land which you gave to our ancestors, this city which you have chosen, and this Temple which I have built for you,"
2 Chronicles,6,39,then listen to their prayers. In your home in heaven hear them and be merciful to them and forgive all the sins of your people.
2 Chronicles,6,40,"“Now, O my God, look on us and listen to the prayers offered in this place."
2 Chronicles,6,41,"Rise up now, Lord God, and with the Covenant Box, the symbol of your power, enter the Temple and stay here forever. Bless your priests in all they do, and may all your people be happy because of your goodness to them."
2 Chronicles,6,42,"Lord God, do not reject the king you have chosen. Remember the love you had for your servant David.”"
2 Chronicles,7,1," When King Solomon finished his prayer, fire came down from heaven and burned up the sacrifices that had been offered, and the dazzling light of the Lord 's presence filled the Temple."
2 Chronicles,7,2,"Because the Temple was full of the dazzling light, the priests could not enter it."
2 Chronicles,7,3,"When the people of Israel saw the fire fall from heaven and the light fill the Temple, they fell face downward on the pavement, worshiping God and praising him for his goodness and his eternal love."
2 Chronicles,7,4,Then Solomon and all the people offered sacrifices to the Lord.
2 Chronicles,7,5,"He sacrificed 22,000 head of cattle and 120,000 sheep as fellowship offerings. And so he and all the people dedicated the Temple."
2 Chronicles,7,6,"The priests stood in the places that were assigned to them, and facing them stood the Levites, praising the Lord with the musical instruments that King David had provided and singing the hymn, “His Love Is Eternal!” as they had been commissioned by David. The priests blew trumpets while all the people stood."
2 Chronicles,7,7,"Solomon consecrated the central part of the courtyard, the area in front of the Temple, and then offered there the sacrifices burned whole, the grain offerings, and the fat from the fellowship offerings. He did this because the bronze altar which he had made was too small for all these offerings."
2 Chronicles,7,8,Solomon and all the people of Israel celebrated the Festival of Shelters for seven days. There was a huge crowd of people from as far away as Hamath Pass in the north and the Egyptian border in the south.
2 Chronicles,7,9,"They had spent seven days for the dedication of the altar and then seven more days for the festival. On the last day they had a closing celebration,"
2 Chronicles,7,10,"and on the following day, the twenty-third day of the seventh month, Solomon sent the people home. They were happy about all the blessings that the Lord had given to his people Israel, to David, and to Solomon."
2 Chronicles,7,11,"After King Solomon had finished the Temple and the palace, successfully completing all his plans for them,"
2 Chronicles,7,12,"the Lord appeared to him at night. He said to him, “I have heard your prayer, and I accept this Temple as the place where sacrifices are to be offered to me."
2 Chronicles,7,13,"Whenever I hold back the rain or send locusts to eat up the crops or send an epidemic on my people,"
2 Chronicles,7,14,"if they pray to me and repent and turn away from the evil they have been doing, then I will hear them in heaven, forgive their sins, and make their land prosperous again."
2 Chronicles,7,15,"I will watch over this Temple and be ready to hear all the prayers that are offered here,"
2 Chronicles,7,16,because I have chosen it and consecrated it as the place where I will be worshiped forever. I will watch over it and protect it for all time.
2 Chronicles,7,17,"If you serve me faithfully as your father David did, obeying my laws and doing everything I have commanded you,"
2 Chronicles,7,18,I will keep the promise I made to your father David when I told him that Israel would always be ruled by his descendants.
2 Chronicles,7,19,"But if you and your people ever disobey the laws and commands I have given you and worship other gods,"
2 Chronicles,7,20,"then I will remove you from the land that I gave you, and I will abandon this Temple that I have consecrated as the place where I am to be worshiped. People everywhere will ridicule it and treat it with contempt."
2 Chronicles,7,21,"“The Temple is now greatly honored, but then everyone who passes by it will be amazed and will ask, ‘Why did the Lord do this to this land and this Temple?’"
2 Chronicles,7,22,"People will answer, ‘It is because they abandoned the Lord their God, who brought their ancestors out of Egypt. They gave their allegiance to other gods and worshiped them. That is why the Lord has brought this disaster on them.’”"
2 Chronicles,8,1,It took Solomon twenty years to build the Temple and his palace.
2 Chronicles,8,2,"He also rebuilt the cities that King Hiram had given him, and sent Israelites to settle in them."
2 Chronicles,8,3,He captured the territory of Hamath and Zobah
2 Chronicles,8,4,and fortified the city of Palmyra in the desert. He rebuilt all the cities in Hamath that were centers for storing supplies.
2 Chronicles,8,5,"Solomon also rebuilt the following cities: Upper Beth Horon and Lower Beth Horon (fortified cities with gates that could be barred),"
2 Chronicles,8,6,"the city of Baalath, all the cities where he stored supplies, and the cities where his horses and chariots were stationed. He carried out all his plans for building in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and throughout the territory that he ruled over."
2 Chronicles,9,1," The queen of Sheba heard of King Solomon's fame, and she traveled to Jerusalem to test him with difficult questions. She brought with her a large group of attendants, as well as camels loaded with spices, jewels, and a large amount of gold. When she and Solomon met, she asked him all the questions that she could think of."
2 Chronicles,9,2,He answered them all; there was nothing too difficult for him to explain.
2 Chronicles,9,3,The queen of Sheba heard Solomon's wisdom and saw the palace he had built.
2 Chronicles,9,4,"She saw the food that was served at his table, the living quarters for his officials, the organization of his palace staff and the uniforms they wore, the clothing of the servants who waited on him at feasts, and the sacrifices he offered in the Temple. It left her breathless and amazed."
2 Chronicles,9,5,"She said to the king, “What I heard in my own country about you and your wisdom is true!"
2 Chronicles,9,6,I did not believe what they told me until I came and saw for myself. I had not heard of even half your wisdom. You are even wiser than people say.
2 Chronicles,9,7,"How fortunate are those who serve you, who are always in your presence and are privileged to hear your wise sayings!"
2 Chronicles,9,8,"Praise the Lord your God! He has shown how pleased he is with you by making you king, to rule in his name. Because he loves his people Israel and wants to preserve them forever, he has made you their king so that you can maintain law and justice.”"
2 Chronicles,9,9,She presented to King Solomon the gifts she had brought: almost five tons of gold and a very large amount of spices and jewels. There have never been any other spices as fine as those that the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.(
2 Chronicles,9,10,The sailors of King Hiram and of King Solomon who brought gold from Ophir also brought juniper wood and jewels.
2 Chronicles,9,11,"Solomon used the wood to make stairs for the Temple and for his palace, and to make harps and lyres for the musicians. Nothing like that had ever been seen before in the land of Judah.)"
2 Chronicles,9,12,King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba everything she asked for. This was in addition to what he gave her in exchange for the gifts she brought to him. Then she and her attendants returned to the land of Sheba.
2 Chronicles,9,13,"Every year King Solomon received over twenty-five tons of gold,"
2 Chronicles,9,14,in addition to the taxes paid by the traders and merchants. The kings of Arabia and the governors of the Israelite districts also brought him silver and gold.
2 Chronicles,9,15,"Solomon made two hundred large shields, each of which was covered with about fifteen pounds of beaten gold,"
2 Chronicles,9,16,"and three hundred smaller shields, each covered with about eight pounds of beaten gold. He had them all placed in the Hall of the Forest of Lebanon."
2 Chronicles,9,17,The king also had a large throne made. Part of it was covered with ivory and the rest of it was covered with pure gold.
2 Chronicles,9,18,"Six steps led up to the throne, and there was a footstool attached to it, covered with gold. There were arms on each side of the throne, and the figure of a lion stood at each side."
2 Chronicles,9,19,"Twelve figures of lions were on the steps, one at either end of each step. No throne like this had ever existed in any other kingdom."
2 Chronicles,9,20,"All of King Solomon's drinking cups were made of gold, and all the utensils in the Hall of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. Silver was not considered valuable in Solomon's day."
2 Chronicles,9,21,"He had a fleet of ocean-going ships sailing with King Hiram's fleet. Every three years his fleet would return, bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and monkeys."
2 Chronicles,9,22,King Solomon was richer and wiser than any other king in the world.
2 Chronicles,9,23,"They all consulted him, to hear the wisdom that God had given him."
2 Chronicles,9,24,"Each of them brought Solomon gifts—articles of silver and gold, robes, weapons, spices, horses, and mules. This continued year after year."
2 Chronicles,9,25," King Solomon also had four thousand stalls for his chariots and horses, and had twelve thousand cavalry horses. Some of them he kept in Jerusalem and the rest he stationed in various other cities."
2 Chronicles,9,26,He was supreme ruler of all the kings in the territory from the Euphrates River to Philistia and the Egyptian border.
2 Chronicles,9,27,"During his reign silver was as common in Jerusalem as stone, and cedar was as plentiful as ordinary sycamore in the foothills of Judah."
2 Chronicles,9,28,Solomon imported horses from Musri and from every other country.
2 Chronicles,9,29,"The rest of the history of Solomon from beginning to end is recorded in The History of Nathan the Prophet , in The Prophecy of Ahijah of Shiloh , and in The Visions of Iddo the Prophet , which also deal with the reign of King Jeroboam of Israel."
2 Chronicles,9,30,Solomon ruled in Jerusalem over all Israel for forty years.
2 Chronicles,9,31,"He died and was buried in David's City, and his son Rehoboam succeeded him as king."
2 Chronicles,10,1,"Rehoboam went to Shechem, where all the people of northern Israel had gathered to make him king."
2 Chronicles,10,2,"When Jeroboam son of Nebat, who had gone to Egypt to escape from King Solomon, heard this news, he returned home."
2 Chronicles,10,3,"The people of the northern tribes sent for him, and they all went together to Rehoboam and said to him,"
2 Chronicles,10,4,"“Your father placed heavy burdens on us. If you make these burdens lighter and make life easier for us, we will be your loyal subjects.”"
2 Chronicles,10,5,"Rehoboam replied, “Give me three days to consider the matter. Then come back.” So the people left."
2 Chronicles,10,6,King Rehoboam consulted the older men who had served as his father Solomon's advisers. “What answer do you advise me to give these people?” he asked.
2 Chronicles,10,7,"They replied, “If you are kind to these people and try to please them by giving a considerate answer, they will always serve you loyally.”"
2 Chronicles,10,8,But he ignored the advice of the older men and went instead to the young men who had grown up with him and who were now his advisers.
2 Chronicles,10,9,“What do you advise me to do?” he asked. “What shall I say to the people who are asking me to make their burdens lighter?”
2 Chronicles,10,10,"They replied, “This is what you should tell them: ‘My little finger is thicker than my father's waist.’"
2 Chronicles,10,11,"Tell them, ‘My father placed heavy burdens on you; I will make them even heavier. He beat you with whips; I'll flog you with bullwhips!’”"
2 Chronicles,10,12,"Three days later Jeroboam and all the people returned to King Rehoboam, as he had instructed them."
2 Chronicles,10,13,"The king ignored the advice of the older men and spoke harshly to the people,"
2 Chronicles,10,14,"as the younger men had advised. He said, “My father placed heavy burdens on you; I will make them even heavier. He beat you with whips; I'll flog you with bullwhips!”"
2 Chronicles,10,15,It was the will of the Lord God to bring about what he had spoken to Jeroboam son of Nebat through the prophet Ahijah from Shiloh. This is why the king did not pay any attention to the people.
2 Chronicles,10,16," When the people saw that the king would not listen to them, they shouted, “Down with David and his family! What have they ever done for us? People of Israel, let's go home! Let Rehoboam look out for himself!” So the people of Israel rebelled,"
2 Chronicles,10,17,leaving Rehoboam as king only of the people who lived in the territory of Judah.
2 Chronicles,10,18,"Then King Rehoboam sent Adoniram, who was in charge of the forced labor, to go to the Israelites, but they stoned him to death. At this, Rehoboam hurriedly got in his chariot and escaped to Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,10,19,Ever since that time the people of the northern kingdom of Israel have been in rebellion against the dynasty of David.
2 Chronicles,11,1,"When King Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he called together 180,000 of the best soldiers from the tribes of Benjamin and Judah. He intended to go to war and restore his control over the northern tribes of Israel."
2 Chronicles,11,2,But the Lord told the prophet Shemaiah
2 Chronicles,11,3,to give this message to King Rehoboam and to all the people of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin:
2 Chronicles,11,4,"“Do not attack your own relatives. Go home, all of you. What has happened is my will.” They obeyed the Lord 's command and did not go to fight Jeroboam."
2 Chronicles,11,5,Rehoboam remained in Jerusalem and had fortifications built for the following cities of Judah and Benjamin:
2 Chronicles,11,6,"Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa,"
2 Chronicles,11,7,"Bethzur, Soco, Adullam,"
2 Chronicles,11,8,"Gath, Mareshah, Ziph,"
2 Chronicles,11,9,"Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah,"
2 Chronicles,11,10,"Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron."
2 Chronicles,11,11,"He had them strongly fortified and appointed a commander for each of them, and in each one he placed supplies of food, olive oil, and wine,"
2 Chronicles,11,12,and also shields and spears. In this way he kept Judah and Benjamin under his control.
2 Chronicles,11,13,From all the territory of Israel priests and Levites came south to Judah.
2 Chronicles,11,14,"The Levites abandoned their pastures and other land and moved to Judah and Jerusalem, because King Jeroboam of Israel and his successors would not let them serve as priests of the Lord."
2 Chronicles,11,15,Jeroboam appointed priests of his own to serve at the pagan places of worship and to worship demons and the idols he made in the form of bull-calves.
2 Chronicles,11,16,"From all the tribes of Israel people who sincerely wanted to worship the Lord , the God of Israel, followed the Levites to Jerusalem, so that they could offer sacrifices to the Lord , the God of their ancestors."
2 Chronicles,11,17,"This strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and for three years they supported Rehoboam son of Solomon and lived as they had under the rule of King David and King Solomon."
2 Chronicles,11,18,"Rehoboam married Mahalath, whose father was Jerimoth son of David and whose mother was Abihail, the daughter of Eliab and granddaughter of Jesse."
2 Chronicles,11,19,"They had three sons, Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham."
2 Chronicles,11,20,"Later he married Maacah, the daughter of Absalom, and they had four sons: Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith."
2 Chronicles,11,21,"In all, Rehoboam had eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and he fathered twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters. Of all his wives and concubines he loved Maacah best,"
2 Chronicles,11,22,"and he favored her son Abijah over all his other children, choosing him as the one to succeed him as king."
2 Chronicles,11,23,Rehoboam wisely assigned responsibilities to his sons and stationed them throughout Judah and Benjamin in the fortified cities. He provided generously for them and also secured many wives for them.
2 Chronicles,12,1,"As soon as Rehoboam had established his authority as king, he and all his people abandoned the Law of the Lord."
2 Chronicles,12,2,In the fifth year of Rehoboam's reign their disloyalty to the Lord was punished. King Shishak of Egypt attacked Jerusalem
2 Chronicles,12,3,"with an army of twelve hundred chariots, sixty thousand cavalry, and more soldiers than could be counted, including Libyan, Sukkite, and Ethiopian troops."
2 Chronicles,12,4,He captured the fortified cities of Judah and advanced as far as Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,12,5,"Shemaiah the prophet went to King Rehoboam and the Judean leaders who had gathered in Jerusalem to escape Shishak. He said to them, “This is the Lord 's message to you: ‘You have abandoned me, so now I have abandoned you to Shishak.’”"
2 Chronicles,12,6,"The king and the leaders admitted that they had sinned, and they said, “What the Lord is doing is just.”"
2 Chronicles,12,7,"When the Lord saw this, he spoke again to Shemaiah and said to him, “Because they admit their sin, I will not destroy them. But when Shishak attacks, they will barely survive. Jerusalem will not feel the full force of my anger,"
2 Chronicles,12,8,"but Shishak will conquer them, and they will learn the difference between serving me and serving earthly rulers.”"
2 Chronicles,12,9," King Shishak came to Jerusalem and took the treasures from the Temple and from the palace. He took everything, including the gold shields that King Solomon had made."
2 Chronicles,12,10,"To replace them, Rehoboam made bronze shields and entrusted them to the officers responsible for guarding the palace gates."
2 Chronicles,12,11,"Every time the king went to the Temple, the guards carried the shields and then returned them to the guardroom."
2 Chronicles,12,12,"Because he submitted to the Lord , the Lord 's anger did not completely destroy him, and things went well for Judah."
2 Chronicles,12,13,"Rehoboam ruled in Jerusalem and increased his power as king. He was forty-one years old when he became king, and he ruled for seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the Lord had chosen from all the territory of Israel as the place where he was to be worshiped. Rehoboam's mother was Naamah, from the land of Ammon."
2 Chronicles,12,14,"He did what was evil, because he did not try to find the Lord 's will."
2 Chronicles,12,15,Rehoboam's acts from beginning to end and his family records are found in The History of Shemaiah the Prophet and The History of Iddo the Prophet . Rehoboam and Jeroboam were constantly at war with each other.
2 Chronicles,12,16,Rehoboam died and was buried in the royal tombs in David's City and his son Abijah succeeded him as king.
2 Chronicles,13,1,"In the eighteenth year of the reign of King Jeroboam of Israel, Abijah became king of Judah,"
2 Chronicles,13,2,"and he ruled three years in Jerusalem. His mother was Micaiah daughter of Uriel, from the city of Gibeah. War broke out between Abijah and Jeroboam."
2 Chronicles,13,3,"Abijah raised an army of 400,000 soldiers, and Jeroboam opposed him with an army of 800,000."
2 Chronicles,13,4,The armies met in the hill country of Ephraim. King Abijah went up Mount Zemaraim and called out to Jeroboam and the Israelites: “Listen to me!” he said.
2 Chronicles,13,5,"“Don't you know that the Lord , the God of Israel, made an unbreakable covenant with David, giving him and his descendants kingship over Israel forever?"
2 Chronicles,13,6,"Jeroboam son of Nebat rebelled against Solomon, his king."
2 Chronicles,13,7,"Later he gathered together a group of worthless scoundrels, and they forced their will on Rehoboam son of Solomon, who was too young and inexperienced to resist them."
2 Chronicles,13,8,Now you propose to fight against the royal authority that the Lord gave to David's descendants. You have a huge army and have with you the gold bull-calves that Jeroboam made to be your gods.
2 Chronicles,13,9,"You drove out the Lord 's priests, the descendants of Aaron, and you drove out the Levites. In their place you appointed priests in the same way that other nations do. Anybody who comes along with a bull or seven sheep can get himself consecrated as a priest of those so-called gods of yours."
2 Chronicles,13,10,"“But we still serve the Lord our God and have not abandoned him. Priests descended from Aaron perform their duties, and Levites assist them."
2 Chronicles,13,11,"Every morning and every evening they offer him incense and animal sacrifices burned whole. They present the offerings of bread on a table that is ritually clean, and every evening they light the lamps on the gold lampstand. We do what the Lord has commanded, but you have abandoned him."
2 Chronicles,13,12,"God himself is our leader and his priests are here with trumpets, ready to blow them and call us to battle against you. People of Israel, don't fight against the Lord , the God of your ancestors! You can't win!”"
2 Chronicles,13,13,"Meanwhile Jeroboam had sent some of his troops to ambush the Judean army from the rear, while the rest faced them from the front."
2 Chronicles,13,14,"The Judeans looked around and saw that they were surrounded. They cried to the Lord for help, and the priests blew the trumpets."
2 Chronicles,13,15,"The Judeans gave a loud shout, and led by Abijah, they attacked; God defeated Jeroboam and the Israelite army."
2 Chronicles,13,16,"The Israelites fled from the Judeans, and God let the Judeans overpower them."
2 Chronicles,13,17,Abijah and his army dealt the Israelites a crushing defeat—half a million of Israel's best soldiers were killed.
2 Chronicles,13,18,"And so the people of Judah were victorious over Israel, because they relied on the Lord , the God of their ancestors."
2 Chronicles,13,19,"Abijah pursued Jeroboam's army and occupied some of his cities: Bethel, Jeshanah, and Ephron, and the villages near each of these cities."
2 Chronicles,13,20,"Jeroboam never regained his power during Abijah's reign. Finally the Lord struck him down, and he died."
2 Chronicles,13,21,"Abijah, however, grew more powerful. He had fourteen wives and fathered twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters."
2 Chronicles,13,22,"The rest of the history of Abijah, what he said and what he did, is written in The History of Iddo the Prophet."
2 Chronicles,14,1,"King Abijah died and was buried in the royal tombs in David's City. His son Asa succeeded him as king, and under Asa the land enjoyed peace for ten years."
2 Chronicles,14,2,"Asa pleased the Lord , his God, by doing what was right and good."
2 Chronicles,14,3,"He removed the foreign altars and the pagan places of worship, broke down the sacred stone columns, and cut down the symbols of the goddess Asherah."
2 Chronicles,14,4,"He commanded the people of Judah to do the will of the Lord , the God of their ancestors, and to obey his teachings and commands."
2 Chronicles,14,5,"Because he abolished the pagan places of worship and the incense altars from all the cities of Judah, the kingdom was at peace under his rule."
2 Chronicles,14,6,"He built fortifications for the cities of Judah during this time, and for several years there was no war, because the Lord gave him peace."
2 Chronicles,14,7,"He told the people of Judah, “Let us fortify the cities by building walls and towers, and gates that can be shut and barred. We have control of the land because we have done the will of the Lord our God. He has protected us and given us security on every side.” And so they built and prospered."
2 Chronicles,14,8,"King Asa had an army of 300,000 men from Judah, armed with shields and spears, and 280,000 men from Benjamin, armed with shields and bows. All of them were brave, well-trained men."
2 Chronicles,14,9,An Ethiopian named Zerah invaded Judah with an army of a million men and three hundred chariots and advanced as far as Mareshah.
2 Chronicles,14,10,"Asa went out to fight him, and both sides took up their positions at Zephathah Valley near Mareshah."
2 Chronicles,14,11,"Asa prayed to the Lord his God, “O Lord , you can help a weak army as easily as a powerful one. Help us now, O Lord our God, because we are relying on you, and in your name we have come out to fight against this huge army. Lord , you are our God; no one can hope to defeat you.”"
2 Chronicles,14,12,"The Lord defeated the Ethiopian army when Asa and the Judean army attacked them. They fled,"
2 Chronicles,14,13,"and Asa and his troops pursued them as far as Gerar. So many of the Ethiopians were killed that the army was unable to rally and fight. They were overpowered by the Lord and his army, and the army took large amounts of loot."
2 Chronicles,14,14,"Then they were able to destroy the cities in the area around Gerar, because the people there were terrified of the Lord . The army plundered all those cities and captured large amounts of loot."
2 Chronicles,14,15,"They also attacked the camps of some shepherds, capturing large numbers of sheep and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,15,1,"The spirit of God came upon Azariah son of Oded,"
2 Chronicles,15,2,"and he went to meet King Asa. He called out, “Listen to me, King Asa, and all you people of Judah and Benjamin! The Lord is with you as long as you are with him. If you look for him, he will let you find him, but if you turn away, he will abandon you."
2 Chronicles,15,3,"For a long time Israel lived without the true God, without priests to teach them, and without a law."
2 Chronicles,15,4,"But when trouble came, they turned to the Lord , the God of Israel. They searched for him and found him."
2 Chronicles,15,5,"In those days no one could come and go in safety, because there was trouble and disorder in every land."
2 Chronicles,15,6,"One nation oppressed another nation, and one city oppressed another city, because God was bringing trouble and distress on them."
2 Chronicles,15,7,But you must be strong and not be discouraged. The work that you do will be rewarded.”
2 Chronicles,15,8,"When Asa heard the prophecy that Azariah son of Oded had spoken, he was encouraged. He did away with all the idols in the land of Judah and Benjamin and all the idols in the cities he had captured in the hill country of Ephraim. He also repaired the altar of the Lord that stood in the Temple courtyard."
2 Chronicles,15,9,"Many people had come over to Asa's side from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon, and were living in his kingdom, because they had seen that the Lord was with him. Asa summoned all of them and the people of Judah and Benjamin."
2 Chronicles,15,10,They assembled in Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year that Asa was king.
2 Chronicles,15,11,On that day they offered sacrifices to the Lord from the loot they had brought back: seven hundred head of cattle and seven thousand sheep.
2 Chronicles,15,12,"They made a covenant in which they agreed to worship the Lord , the God of their ancestors, with all their heart and soul."
2 Chronicles,15,13,"Anyone, young or old, male or female, who did not worship him was to be put to death."
2 Chronicles,15,14,"In a loud voice they took an oath in the Lord 's name that they would keep the covenant, and then they shouted and blew trumpets."
2 Chronicles,15,15,"All the people of Judah were happy because they had made this covenant with all their heart. They took delight in worshiping the Lord , and he accepted them and gave them peace on every side."
2 Chronicles,15,16,"King Asa removed his grandmother Maacah from her position as queen mother, because she had made an obscene idol of the fertility goddess Asherah. Asa cut down the idol, chopped it up, and burned the pieces in Kidron Valley."
2 Chronicles,15,17,"Even though Asa did not destroy all the pagan places of worship in the land, he remained faithful to the Lord all his life."
2 Chronicles,15,18,"He placed in the Temple all the objects his father Abijah had dedicated to God, as well as the gold and silver objects that he himself dedicated."
2 Chronicles,15,19,There was no more war until the thirty-fifth year of his reign.
2 Chronicles,16,1,"In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of King Asa of Judah, King Baasha of Israel invaded Judah and started to fortify Ramah in order to cut off all traffic in and out of Judah."
2 Chronicles,16,2,"So Asa took silver and gold from the treasuries of the Temple and the palace and sent it to Damascus, to King Benhadad of Syria, with this message:"
2 Chronicles,16,3,"“Let us be allies, as our fathers were. This silver and gold is a present for you. Now break your alliance with King Baasha of Israel so that he will have to pull his troops out of my territory.”"
2 Chronicles,16,4,"Benhadad agreed to Asa's proposal and sent his commanding officers and their armies to attack the cities of Israel. They captured Ijon, Dan, Abel Beth Maacah, and all the cities of Naphtali where supplies were stored."
2 Chronicles,16,5,"When King Baasha heard what was happening, he stopped fortifying Ramah and abandoned the work."
2 Chronicles,16,6,"Then King Asa gathered men from throughout Judah and had them carry off the stones and timbers that Baasha had been using at Ramah, and they used them to fortify the cities of Geba and Mizpah."
2 Chronicles,16,7,"At that time the prophet Hanani went to King Asa and said, “Because you relied on the king of Syria instead of relying on the Lord your God, the army of the king of Israel has escaped from you."
2 Chronicles,16,8,"Didn't the Ethiopians and the Libyans have large armies with many chariots and cavalry troops? But because you relied on the Lord , he gave you victory over them."
2 Chronicles,16,9,"The Lord keeps close watch over the whole world, to give strength to those whose hearts are loyal to him. You have acted foolishly, and so from now on you will always be at war.”"
2 Chronicles,16,10,This made Asa so angry with the prophet that he had him put in chains. It was at this same time that Asa began treating some of the people cruelly.
2 Chronicles,16,11,All the events of Asa's reign from beginning to end are recorded in The History of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
2 Chronicles,16,12,"In the thirty-ninth year that Asa was king, he was crippled by a severe foot disease; but even then he did not turn to the Lord for help, but to doctors."
2 Chronicles,16,13,Two years later he died
2 Chronicles,16,14,"and was buried in the rock tomb which he had carved out for himself in David's City. They used spices and perfumed oils to prepare his body for burial, and they built a huge bonfire to mourn his death."
2 Chronicles,17,1,Jehoshaphat succeeded his father Asa as king and strengthened his position against Israel.
2 Chronicles,17,2,"He stationed troops in the fortified cities of Judah, in the Judean countryside, and in the cities which Asa had captured in the territory of Ephraim."
2 Chronicles,17,3,The Lord blessed Jehoshaphat because he followed the example of his father's early life and did not worship Baal.
2 Chronicles,17,4,"He served his father's God, obeyed God's commands, and did not act the way the kings of Israel did."
2 Chronicles,17,5,"The Lord gave Jehoshaphat firm control over the kingdom of Judah, and all the people brought him gifts, so that he became wealthy and highly honored."
2 Chronicles,17,6,He took pride in serving the Lord and destroyed all the pagan places of worship and the symbols of the goddess Asherah in Judah.
2 Chronicles,17,7,"In the third year of his reign he sent out the following officials to teach in the cities of Judah: Benhail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah."
2 Chronicles,17,8,"They were accompanied by nine Levites and two priests. The Levites were Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah; and the priests were Elishama and Jehoram."
2 Chronicles,17,9,"They took the book of the Law of the Lord and went through all the towns of Judah, teaching it to the people."
2 Chronicles,17,10,The Lord made all the surrounding kingdoms afraid to go to war against King Jehoshaphat.
2 Chronicles,17,11,"Some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat a large amount of silver and other gifts, and some Arabs brought him 7,700 sheep and 7,700 goats."
2 Chronicles,17,12,"So Jehoshaphat continued to grow more and more powerful. Throughout Judah he built fortifications and cities,"
2 Chronicles,17,13,"where supplies were stored in huge amounts. In Jerusalem he stationed outstanding officers,"
2 Chronicles,17,14,"according to their clans. Adnah was the commander of the troops from the clans of Judah, and he had 300,000 soldiers under him."
2 Chronicles,17,15,"Second in rank was Jehohanan, with 280,000 soldiers,"
2 Chronicles,17,16,"and third was Amasiah son of Zichri, with 200,000. (Amasiah had volunteered to serve the Lord .)"
2 Chronicles,17,17,"The commander of the troops from the clans of Benjamin was Eliada, an outstanding soldier, in command of 200,000 men armed with shields and bows."
2 Chronicles,17,18,"His second in command was Jehozabad with 180,000 men, well-equipped for battle."
2 Chronicles,17,19,"These soldiers served the king in Jerusalem, and in addition he stationed others in the other fortified cities of Judah."
2 Chronicles,18,1,"When King Jehoshaphat of Judah became rich and famous, he arranged a marriage between a member of his family and the family of King Ahab of Israel."
2 Chronicles,18,2,"A number of years later Jehoshaphat went to the city of Samaria to visit Ahab. To honor Jehoshaphat and those with him, Ahab had a large number of sheep and cattle slaughtered for a feast. He tried to persuade Jehoshaphat to join him in attacking the city of Ramoth in Gilead."
2 Chronicles,18,3,"He asked, “Will you go with me to attack Ramoth?” Jehoshaphat replied, “I am ready when you are, and so is my army. We will join you.”"
2 Chronicles,18,4,"Then he added, “But first let's consult the Lord .”"
2 Chronicles,18,5,"So Ahab called in the prophets, about four hundred of them, and asked them, “Should I go and attack Ramoth, or not?” “Attack it,” they answered. “God will give you victory.”"
2 Chronicles,18,6,"But Jehoshaphat asked, “Isn't there another prophet through whom we can consult the Lord ?”"
2 Chronicles,18,7,"Ahab answered, “There is one more, Micaiah son of Imlah. But I hate him because he never prophesies anything good for me; it's always something bad.” “You shouldn't say that!” Jehoshaphat replied."
2 Chronicles,18,8,So King Ahab called in a court official and told him to go and get Micaiah at once.
2 Chronicles,18,9,"The two kings, dressed in their royal robes, were sitting on their thrones at the threshing place just outside the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets were prophesying in front of them."
2 Chronicles,18,10,"One of them, Zedekiah son of Chenaanah, made iron horns and said to Ahab, “This is what the Lord says, ‘With these you will fight the Syrians and totally defeat them.’”"
2 Chronicles,18,11,"All the other prophets said the same thing. “March against Ramoth and you will win,” they said. “The Lord will give you victory.”"
2 Chronicles,18,12,"Meanwhile, the official who had gone to get Micaiah said to him, “All the other prophets have prophesied success for the king, and you had better do the same.”"
2 Chronicles,18,13,"But Micaiah answered, “By the living Lord I will say what my God tells me to!”"
2 Chronicles,18,14,"When he appeared before King Ahab, the king asked him, “Micaiah, should King Jehoshaphat and I go and attack Ramoth, or not?” “Attack!” Micaiah answered. “Of course you'll win. The Lord will give you victory.”"
2 Chronicles,18,15,"But Ahab replied, “When you speak to me in the name of the Lord , tell the truth! How many times do I have to tell you that?”"
2 Chronicles,18,16," Micaiah answered, “I can see the army of Israel scattered over the hills like sheep without a shepherd. And the Lord said, ‘These men have no leader; let them go home in peace.’”"
2 Chronicles,18,17,"Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “I told you that he never prophesies anything good for me; it's always something bad!”"
2 Chronicles,18,18,"Micaiah went on: “Now listen to what the Lord says! I saw the Lord sitting on his throne in heaven, with all his angels standing beside him."
2 Chronicles,18,19,"The Lord asked, ‘Who will deceive Ahab so that he will go and get killed at Ramoth?’ Some of the angels said one thing, and others said something else,"
2 Chronicles,18,20,"until a spirit stepped forward, approached the Lord , and said, ‘I will deceive him.’ ‘How?’ the Lord asked."
2 Chronicles,18,21,"The spirit replied, ‘I will go and make all of Ahab's prophets tell lies.’ The Lord said, ‘Go and deceive him. You will succeed.’”"
2 Chronicles,18,22,And Micaiah concluded: “This is what has happened. The Lord has made these prophets of yours lie to you. But he himself has decreed that you will meet with disaster!”
2 Chronicles,18,23,"Then the prophet Zedekiah went up to Micaiah, slapped his face, and asked, “Since when did the Lord 's spirit leave me and speak to you?”"
2 Chronicles,18,24,"“You will find out when you go into some back room to hide,” Micaiah replied."
2 Chronicles,18,25,"Then King Ahab ordered one of his officers, “Arrest Micaiah and take him to Amon, the governor of the city, and to Prince Joash."
2 Chronicles,18,26,Tell them to throw him in prison and to put him on bread and water until I return safely.”
2 Chronicles,18,27,"“If you return safely,” Micaiah exclaimed, “then the Lord has not spoken through me!” And he added, “Listen, everyone, to what I have said!”"
2 Chronicles,18,28,Then King Ahab of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah went to attack the city of Ramoth in Gilead.
2 Chronicles,18,29,"Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “As we go into battle, I will disguise myself, but you wear your royal garments.” So the king of Israel went into battle in disguise."
2 Chronicles,18,30,The king of Syria had ordered his chariot commanders to attack no one else except the king of Israel.
2 Chronicles,18,31,"So when they saw King Jehoshaphat, they all thought that he was the king of Israel, and they turned to attack him. But Jehoshaphat gave a shout, and the Lord God rescued him and turned the attack away from him."
2 Chronicles,18,32,"The chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel, so they stopped pursuing him."
2 Chronicles,18,33,"By chance, however, a Syrian soldier shot an arrow which struck King Ahab between the joints of his armor. “I'm wounded!” he cried out to his chariot driver. “Turn around and pull out of the battle!”"
2 Chronicles,18,34,"While the battle raged on, King Ahab remained propped up in his chariot, facing the Syrians. At sunset he died."
2 Chronicles,19,1,King Jehoshaphat of Judah returned safely to his palace in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,19,2,"A prophet, Jehu son of Hanani, went to meet the king and said to him, “Do you think it is right to help those who are wicked and to take the side of those who hate the Lord ? What you have done has brought the Lord 's anger on you."
2 Chronicles,19,3,"But even so, there is some good in you. You have removed all the symbols of the goddess Asherah which people worshiped, and you have tried to follow God's will.”"
2 Chronicles,19,4,"Even though King Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem, he traveled regularly among the people, from Beersheba in the south to the edge of the hill country of Ephraim in the north, in order to call the people back to the Lord , the God of their ancestors."
2 Chronicles,19,5,He appointed judges in each of the fortified cities of Judah
2 Chronicles,19,6,"and instructed them: “Be careful in pronouncing judgment; you are not acting on human authority, but on the authority of the Lord , and he is with you when you pass sentence."
2 Chronicles,19,7,"Honor the Lord and act carefully, because the Lord our God does not tolerate fraud or partiality or the taking of bribes.”"
2 Chronicles,19,8,"In Jerusalem Jehoshaphat appointed Levites, priests, and some of the leading citizens as judges in cases involving a violation of the Law of the Lord or legal disputes between inhabitants of the city."
2 Chronicles,19,9,"He gave them the following instructions: “You must perform your duties in reverence for the Lord , faithfully obeying him in everything you do."
2 Chronicles,19,10,"Whenever your fellow citizens from any of the cities bring before you a case of homicide or any other violation of a law or commandment, you must instruct them carefully how to conduct themselves during the trial, so that they do not become guilty of sinning against the Lord . Unless you do, you and your fellow citizens will feel the force of the Lord 's anger. But if you do your duty, you will not be guilty."
2 Chronicles,19,11,"Amariah the High Priest will have final authority in all religious cases, and Zebadiah son of Ishmael, governor of Judah, will have final authority in all civil cases. The Levites have the responsibility of seeing that the decisions of the courts are carried out. Be courageous and carry out these instructions, and may the Lord be on the side of the right!”"
2 Chronicles,20,1,"Some time later the armies of Moab and Ammon, together with their allies, the Meunites, invaded Judah."
2 Chronicles,20,2,Some messengers came and announced to King Jehoshaphat: “A large army from Edom has come from the other side of the Dead Sea to attack you. They have already captured Hazazon Tamar.” (This is another name for Engedi.)
2 Chronicles,20,3,Jehoshaphat was frightened and prayed to the Lord for guidance. Then he gave orders for a fast to be observed throughout the country.
2 Chronicles,20,4,"From every city of Judah people hurried to Jerusalem to ask the Lord for guidance,"
2 Chronicles,20,5,and they and the people of Jerusalem gathered in the new courtyard of the Temple. King Jehoshaphat went and stood before them
2 Chronicles,20,6,"and prayed aloud, “O Lord God of our ancestors, you rule in heaven over all the nations of the world. You are powerful and mighty, and no one can oppose you."
2 Chronicles,20,7,"You are our God. When your people Israel moved into this land, you drove out the people who were living here and gave the land to the descendants of Abraham, your friend, to be theirs forever."
2 Chronicles,20,8,"They have lived here and have built a temple to honor you, knowing"
2 Chronicles,20,9,"that if any disaster struck them to punish them—a war, an epidemic, or a famine—then they could come and stand in front of this Temple where you are worshiped. They could pray to you in their trouble, and you would hear them and rescue them."
2 Chronicles,20,10," “Now the people of Ammon, Moab, and Edom have attacked us. When our ancestors came out of Egypt, you did not allow them to enter those lands, so our ancestors went around them and did not destroy them."
2 Chronicles,20,11,This is how they repay us—they come to drive us out of the land that you gave us.
2 Chronicles,20,12,"You are our God! Punish them, for we are helpless in the face of this large army that is attacking us. We do not know what to do, but we look to you for help.”"
2 Chronicles,20,13,"All the men of Judah, with their wives and children, were standing there at the Temple."
2 Chronicles,20,14,"The spirit of the Lord came upon a Levite who was present in the crowd. His name was Jahaziel son of Zechariah; he was a member of the clan of Asaph and was descended from Asaph through Mattaniah, Jeiel, and Benaiah."

2 Chronicles,24,11,"Every day the Levites would take the box to the royal official who was in charge of it. Whenever it was full, the royal secretary and the High Priest's representative would take the money out and return the box to its place. And so they collected a large sum of money."

2 Chronicles,33,14,"After this, Manasseh increased the height of the outer wall on the east side of David's City, from a point in the valley near Gihon Spring north to the Fish Gate and the area of the city called Ophel.

2 Chronicles,34,10,"This money was then handed over to the three men in charge of the Temple repairs, and they gave it to"
2 Chronicles,34,11,the carpenters and the builders to buy the stones and the timber used to repair the buildings that the kings of Judah had allowed to decay.
2 Chronicles,34,12,"The men who did the work were thoroughly honest. They were supervised by four Levites: Jahath and Obadiah of the clan of Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam of the clan of Kohath. (The Levites were all skillful musicians.)"

2 Chronicles,34,21,“Go and consult the Lord for me and for the people who still remain in Israel and Judah. Find out about the teachings of this book. The Lord is angry with us because our ancestors have not obeyed the word of the Lord and have not done what this book says must be done.”
2 Chronicles,34,22,"At the king's command, Hilkiah and the others went to consult a woman named Huldah, a prophet who lived in the newer part of Jerusalem. (Her husband Shallum, the son of Tikvah and grandson of Harhas, was in charge of the Temple robes.) They described to her what had happened,"
2 Chronicles,34,23,and she told them to go back to the king and give him
2 Chronicles,34,24,the following message from the Lord : “I am going to punish Jerusalem and all its people with the curses written in the book that was read to the king.
2 Chronicles,34,25,"They have rejected me and have offered sacrifices to other gods, and so have stirred up my anger by all they have done. My anger is aroused against Jerusalem, and it will not die down."

2 Chronicles,34,27,"and you repented and humbled yourself before me, tearing your clothes and weeping, when you heard how I threatened to punish Jerusalem and its people. I have heard your prayer,"
2 Chronicles,34,28,and the punishment which I am going to bring on Jerusalem will not come until after your death. I will let you die in peace.” The men returned to King Josiah with this message.
2 Chronicles,34,29,"King Josiah summoned all the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem,"
2 Chronicles,34,30,"and together they went to the Temple, accompanied by the priests and the Levites and all the rest of the people, rich and poor alike. Before them all the king read aloud the whole book of the covenant, which had been found in the Temple."
2 Chronicles,34,31,"He stood by the royal column and made a covenant with the Lord to obey him, to keep his laws and commands with all his heart and soul, and to put into practice the demands attached to the covenant, as written in the book."

You are no longer to carry it from place to place, but you are to serve the Lord your God and his people Israel."
2 Chronicles,35,4,"Take your places in the Temple by clans, according to the responsibilities assigned to you by King David and his son King Solomon,"

2 Chronicles,35,21,"but Neco sent Josiah this message: “This war I am fighting does not concern you, King of Judah. I have not come to fight you, but to fight my enemies, and God has told me to hurry. God is on my side, so don't oppose me, or he will destroy you.”"
