Numbers,1,1," On the first day of the second month in the second year after the people of Israel left Egypt, the Lord spoke to Moses there in the Tent of his presence in the Sinai Desert. He said,"
Numbers,1,2,“You and Aaron are to take a census of the people of Israel by clans and families. List the names of all the men
Numbers,1,3,twenty years old or older who are fit for military service.
Numbers,1,4,Ask one clan chief from each tribe to help you.”
Numbers,2,1,The Lord gave Moses and Aaron the following instructions.
Numbers,2,2,"When the Israelites set up camp, each man will camp under the banner of his division and the flag of his own clan. The camp is to be set up all around the Tent."
Numbers,3,1,This is the family of Aaron and Moses at the time the Lord spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai.
Numbers,3,2,"Aaron had four sons: Nadab, the oldest, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar."
Numbers,3,3,"They were anointed and ordained as priests,"
Numbers,3,4,"but Nadab and Abihu were killed when they offered unholy fire to the Lord in the Sinai Desert. They had no children, so Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests during Aaron's lifetime."
Numbers,3,5,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Numbers,3,6,“Bring forward the tribe of Levi and appoint them as servants of Aaron the priest.
Numbers,3,7,They shall do the work required for the Tent of my presence and perform duties for the priests and for the whole community.
Numbers,3,8,They shall take charge of all the equipment of the Tent and perform the duties for the rest of the Israelites.
Numbers,3,9,The only responsibility the Levites have is to serve Aaron and his sons.
Numbers,3,10,You shall appoint Aaron and his sons to carry out the duties of the priesthood; anyone else who tries to do so shall be put to death.”
Numbers,3,11,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Numbers,4,1,The Lord told Moses
Numbers,4,2,"to take a census of the Levite clan of Kohath by subclans and families,"
Numbers,4,3,and to register all the men between the ages of thirty and fifty who were qualified to work in the Tent of the Lord 's presence.
Numbers,4,4,Their service involves the most holy things.
Numbers,4,5,"The Lord gave Moses the following instructions. When it is time to break camp, Aaron and his sons shall enter the Tent, take down the curtain in front of the Covenant Box, and cover the Box with it."
Numbers,4,6,"They shall put a fine leather cover over it, spread a cloth of solid blue on top, and then insert the carrying poles."
Numbers,4,7,"They shall spread a blue cloth over the table for the bread offered to the Lord and put on it the dishes, the incense bowls, the offering bowls, and the jars for the wine offering. There shall always be bread on the table."
Numbers,4,8,"They shall spread a red cloth over all of this, put a fine leather cover over it, and then insert the carrying poles."
Numbers,4,9,"They shall take a blue cloth and cover the lampstand, with its lamps, tongs, trays, and all the olive oil containers."
Numbers,4,10,They shall wrap it and all its equipment in a fine leather cover and place it on a carrying frame.
Numbers,4,11,"Next they shall spread a blue cloth over the gold altar, put a fine leather cover over it, and then insert the carrying poles."
Numbers,4,12,"They shall take all the utensils used in the Holy Place, wrap them in a blue cloth, put a fine leather cover over them, and place them on a carrying frame."
Numbers,4,13,They shall remove the greasy ashes from the altar and spread a purple cloth over it.
Numbers,4,14,"They shall put on it all the equipment used in the service at the altar: fire pans, hooks, shovels, and basins. Then they shall put a fine leather cover over it and insert the carrying poles."
Numbers,4,15,"When it is time to break camp, the clan of Kohath shall come to carry the sacred objects only after Aaron and his sons have finished covering them and all their equipment. The Kohath clan must not touch the sacred objects, or they will die. These are the responsibilities of the Kohath clan whenever the Tent is moved."
Numbers,4,16,"Eleazar son of Aaron the priest shall be responsible for the whole Tent and for the oil for the lamps, the incense, the grain offerings, the anointing oil, and everything else in the Tent that has been consecrated to the Lord."
Numbers,4,17,"The Lord said to Moses and Aaron,"
Numbers,4,18,“Do not let the clan of Kohath
Numbers,4,19,"be killed by coming near these most sacred objects. To prevent this from happening, Aaron and his sons shall go in and assign each man his task and tell him what to carry."
Numbers,4,20,"But if the Kohathites enter the Tent and see the priests preparing the sacred objects for moving, they will die.”"
Numbers,4,21,The Lord told Moses
Numbers,4,22,"to take a census of the Levite clan of Gershon by subclans and families,"
Numbers,4,23,and to register all the men between the ages of thirty and fifty who were qualified to work in the Tent of the Lord 's presence.
Numbers,4,24,They shall be responsible for carrying the following objects:
Numbers,4,25,"the Tent, its inner cover, its outer cover, the fine leather cover on top of it, the curtain for the entrance,"
Numbers,4,26,"the curtains and ropes for the court that is around the Tent and the altar, the curtains for the entrance of the court, and all the fittings used in setting up these objects. They shall perform all the tasks required for these things."
Numbers,4,27,Moses and Aaron shall see to it that the Gershonites perform all the duties and carry everything that Aaron and his sons assign to them.
Numbers,4,28,These are the responsibilities of the Gershon clan in the Tent; they shall carry them out under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.
Numbers,4,29,"The Lord told Moses to take a census of the Levite clan of Merari by subclans and families,"
Numbers,4,30,and to register all the men between the ages of thirty and fifty who were qualified to work in the Tent of the Lord 's presence.
Numbers,4,31,"They shall be responsible for carrying the frames, bars, posts, and bases of the Tent,"
Numbers,4,32,"and the posts, bases, pegs, and ropes of the court around the Tent, with all the fittings used in setting them up. Each man will be responsible for carrying specific items."
Numbers,4,33,These are the responsibilities of the Merari clan in their service in the Tent; they shall carry them out under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.
Numbers,5,1,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Numbers,5,2,“Command the people of Israel to expel from the camp everyone with a dreaded skin disease or a bodily discharge and everyone who is unclean by contact with a corpse.
Numbers,5,3,"Send all these ritually unclean people out, so that they will not defile the camp, where I live among my people.”"
Numbers,5,4,The Israelites obeyed and expelled them all from the camp.
Numbers,5,5, The Lord gave Moses
Numbers,5,6,"the following instructions for the people of Israel. When any of you are unfaithful to the Lord and commit a wrong against someone,"
Numbers,5,7,"you must confess your sin and make full repayment, plus an additional 20 percent, to the person you have wronged."
Numbers,5,8,"But if that person has died and has no near relative to whom payment can be made, it shall be given to the Lord for the priest. This payment is in addition to the ram used to perform the ritual of purification for the guilty person."
Numbers,5,9,Also every special contribution which the Israelites offer to the Lord belongs to the priest to whom they present it.
Numbers,5,10,Each priest shall keep the offerings presented to him.
Numbers,5,11,The Lord commanded Moses
Numbers,6,1,The Lord commanded Moses
Numbers,6,2,"to give the following instructions to the people of Israel. Any of you, male or female, who make a special vow to become a nazirite and dedicate yourself to the Lord"
Numbers,6,3,shall abstain from wine and beer. You shall not drink any kind of drink made from grapes or eat any grapes or raisins.
Numbers,6,4,"As long as you are a nazirite, you shall not eat anything that comes from a grapevine, not even the seeds or skins of grapes."
Numbers,6,5,"As long as you are under the nazirite vow, you must not cut your hair or shave. You are bound by the vow for the full time that you are dedicated to the Lord , and you shall let your hair grow."
Numbers,7,1,"On the day Moses finished setting up the Tent of the Lord 's presence, he anointed and dedicated the Tent and all its equipment, and the altar and all its equipment."
Numbers,7,2,"Then the clan chiefs who were leaders in the tribes of Israel, the same men who were in charge of the census,"
Numbers,7,3,"brought their offerings to the Lord : six wagons and twelve oxen, a wagon for every two leaders and an ox for each leader. After they had presented them,"
Numbers,7,4,"the Lord said to Moses,"
Numbers,7,5,“Accept these gifts for use in the work to be done for the Tent; give them to the Levites according to the work they have to do.”
Numbers,7,6,So Moses gave the wagons and the oxen to the Levites.
Numbers,7,7,"He gave two wagons and four oxen to the Gershonites,"
Numbers,7,8,and four wagons and eight oxen to the Merarites. All their work was to be done under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron.
Numbers,7,9,"But Moses gave no wagons or oxen to the Kohathites, because the sacred objects they took care of had to be carried on their shoulders."
Numbers,7,10,"The leaders also brought offerings to celebrate the dedication of the altar. When they were ready to present their gifts at the altar,"
Numbers,7,11,"the Lord said to Moses, “Tell them that each day for a period of twelve days one of the leaders is to present his gifts for the dedication of the altar.”"
Numbers,8,1," The Lord said to Moses,"
Numbers,8,2,"“Tell Aaron that when he puts the seven lamps on the lampstand, he should place them so that the light shines toward the front.”"
Numbers,8,3,Aaron obeyed and placed the lamps facing the front of the lampstand.
Numbers,8,4,"From top to bottom the lampstand was made of hammered gold, according to the pattern that the Lord had shown Moses."
Numbers,8,5,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Numbers,8,6,“Separate the Levites from the rest of the people of Israel and purify them
Numbers,8,7,in the following way: sprinkle them with the water of purification and have them shave their whole bodies and have them wash their clothes. Then they will be ritually clean.
Numbers,8,8,Then they are to take a young bull and the required grain offering of flour mixed with olive oil; and you are to take another bull for the sin offering.
Numbers,8,9,Then assemble the whole community of Israel and have the Levites stand in front of the Tent of my presence.
Numbers,8,10,"The people of Israel are to place their hands on the heads of the Levites,"
Numbers,8,11,"and then Aaron shall dedicate the Levites to me as a special gift from the Israelites, so that they may do my work."
Numbers,8,12,"The Levites shall then put their hands on the heads of the two bulls; one is to be offered as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, in order to perform the ritual of purification for the Levites."
Numbers,8,13,"“Dedicate the Levites as a special gift to me, and put Aaron and his sons in charge of them."
Numbers,8,14,"Separate the Levites in this way from the rest of the Israelites, so that they will belong to me."
Numbers,8,15,"After you have purified and dedicated the Levites, they will be qualified to work in the Tent."
Numbers,8,16,"I have claimed them in the place of all the first-born sons of the Israelites, and they belong to me alone."
Numbers,8,17,"When I killed all the first-born in Egypt, I consecrated as my own the oldest son of each Israelite family and the first-born of every animal."
Numbers,8,18,"I am now taking the Levites instead of all the first-born of the Israelites,"
Numbers,8,19,"and I assign the Levites to Aaron and his sons, as a gift from the Israelites, to work in the Tent for the people of Israel and to protect the Israelites from the disaster that would strike them if they came too near the Holy Place.”"
Numbers,8,20,"So Moses, Aaron, and all the people of Israel dedicated the Levites, as the Lord commanded Moses."
Numbers,8,21,"The Levites purified themselves and washed their clothes, and Aaron dedicated them as a special gift to the Lord . He also performed the ritual of purification for them."
Numbers,8,22,The people did everything the Lord had commanded Moses concerning the Levites. And so the Levites were qualified to work in the Tent under Aaron and his sons.
Numbers,8,23,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Numbers,8,24,"“From the age of twenty-five each Levite shall perform his duties in the Tent of my presence,"
Numbers,8,25,and at the age of fifty he shall retire.
Numbers,8,26,"After that, he may help his fellow Levites in performing their duties in the Tent, but he must not perform any service by himself. This is how you are to regulate the duties of the Levites.”"
Numbers,9,1," The Lord spoke to Moses in the Sinai Desert in the first month of the second year after the people of Israel had left Egypt. He said,"
Numbers,10,1,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Numbers,10,2,“Make two trumpets of hammered silver to use for calling the people together and for breaking camp.
Numbers,10,3,"When long blasts are sounded on both trumpets, the whole community is to gather around you at the entrance to the Tent of my presence."
Numbers,10,4,"But when only one trumpet is sounded, then only the leaders of the clans are to gather around you."
Numbers,10,5,"When short blasts are sounded, the tribes camped on the east will move out."
Numbers,10,6,"When short blasts are sounded a second time, the tribes on the south will move out. So short blasts are to be sounded to break camp,"
Numbers,10,7,"but in order to call the community together, long blasts are to be sounded."
Numbers,10,8,"The trumpets are to be blown by Aaron's sons, the priests. “The following rule is to be observed for all time to come."
Numbers,10,9,"When you are at war in your land, defending yourselves against an enemy who has attacked you, sound the signal for battle on these trumpets. I, the Lord your God, will help you and save you from your enemies."
Numbers,10,10,Also on joyful occasions—at your New Moon Festivals and your other religious festivals—you are to blow the trumpets when you present your burnt offerings and your fellowship offerings. Then I will help you. I am the Lord your God.”
Numbers,10,11,"On the twentieth day of the second month in the second year after the people left Egypt, the cloud over the Tent of the Lord 's presence lifted,"
Numbers,10,12,and the Israelites started on their journey out of the Sinai Desert. The cloud came to rest in the wilderness of Paran.
Numbers,10,13,"They began to march at the command of the Lord through Moses,"
Numbers,10,14,"and each time they moved, they were in the same order. Those under the banner of the division led by the tribe of Judah started out first, company by company, with Nahshon son of Amminadab in command."
Numbers,10,15,"Nethanel son of Zuar was in command of the tribe of Issachar,"
Numbers,10,16,and Eliab son of Helon was in command of the tribe of Zebulun.
Numbers,10,17,"Then the Tent would be taken down, and the clans of Gershon and Merari, who carried it, would start out."
Numbers,10,18,"Next, those under the banner of the division led by the tribe of Reuben would start out, company by company, with Elizur son of Shedeur in command."
Numbers,10,19,"Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai was in command of the tribe of Simeon,"
Numbers,10,20,and Eliasaph son of Deuel was in command of the tribe of Gad.
Numbers,10,21,"Then the Levite clan of Kohath would start out, carrying the sacred objects. By the time they arrived at the next camp, the Tent had been set up again."
Numbers,10,22,"Next, those under the banner of the division led by the tribe of Ephraim would start out, company by company, with Elishama son of Ammihud in command."
Numbers,10,23,"Gamaliel son of Pedahzur was in command of the tribe of Manasseh,"
Numbers,10,24,and Abidan son of Gideoni was in command of the tribe of Benjamin.
Numbers,10,25,"Finally, those under the banner of the division led by the tribe of Dan, serving as the rear guard of all the divisions, would start out, company by company, with Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai in command."
Numbers,10,26,"Pagiel son of Ochran was in command of the tribe of Asher,"
Numbers,10,27,and Ahira son of Enan was in command of the tribe of Naphtali.
Numbers,10,28,"This, then, was the order of march, company by company, whenever the Israelites broke camp and set out."
Numbers,10,29,"Moses said to his brother-in-law Hobab son of Jethro the Midianite, “We are about to start out for the place which the Lord said he would give us. He has promised to make Israel prosperous, so come with us, and we will share our prosperity with you.”"
Numbers,10,30,"Hobab answered, “No, I am going back to my native land.”"
Numbers,10,31,"“Please don't leave us,” Moses said. “You know where we can camp in the wilderness, and you can be our guide."
Numbers,10,32,"If you come with us, we will share with you all the blessings that the Lord gives us.”"
Numbers,10,33,"When the people left Sinai, the holy mountain, they traveled three days. The Lord 's Covenant Box always went ahead of them to find a place for them to camp."
Numbers,10,34,"As they moved on from each camp, the cloud of the Lord was over them by day."
Numbers,10,35," Whenever the Covenant Box started out, Moses would say, “Arise, Lord ; scatter your enemies and put to flight those who hate you!”"
Numbers,10,36,"And whenever it stopped, he would say, “Return, Lord , to the thousands of families of Israel.”"
Numbers,11,1,"The people began to complain to the Lord about their troubles. When the Lord heard them, he became angry and sent fire on the people. It burned among them and destroyed one end of the camp."
Numbers,11,2,"The people cried out to Moses for help; he prayed to the Lord , and the fire died down."
Numbers,11,3,"So the place was named Taberah, because there the fire of the Lord burned among them."
Numbers,11,4,"There were foreigners traveling with the Israelites. They had a strong craving for meat, and even the Israelites themselves began to complain: “If only we could have some meat!"
Numbers,11,5,"In Egypt we used to eat all the fish we wanted, and it cost us nothing. Remember the cucumbers, the watermelons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic we had?"
Numbers,11,6,But now our strength is gone. There is nothing at all to eat—nothing but this manna day after day!”(
Numbers,11,7,"Manna was like small seeds, whitish yellow in color."
Numbers,12,1,"Moses had married a Cushite woman, and Miriam and Aaron criticized him for it."
Numbers,12,2,"They said, “Has the Lord spoken only through Moses? Hasn't he also spoken through us?” The Lord heard what they said. ("
Numbers,12,3,"Moses was a humble man, more humble than anyone else on earth.)"
Numbers,12,4,"Suddenly the Lord said to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, “I want the three of you to come out to the Tent of my presence.” They went,"
Numbers,12,5,"and the Lord came down in a pillar of cloud, stood at the entrance of the Tent, and called out, “Aaron! Miriam!” The two of them stepped forward,"
Numbers,12,6,"and the Lord said, “Now hear what I have to say! When there are prophets among you, I reveal myself to them in visions and speak to them in dreams."
Numbers,12,7,It is different when I speak with my servant Moses; I have put him in charge of all my people Israel.
Numbers,12,8,"So I speak to him face-to-face, clearly and not in riddles; he has even seen my form! How dare you speak against my servant Moses?”"
Numbers,12,9,The Lord was angry with them; and so as he departed
Numbers,12,10,"and the cloud left the Tent, Miriam's skin was suddenly covered with a dreaded disease and turned as white as snow. When Aaron looked at her and saw that she was covered with the disease,"
Numbers,12,11,"he said to Moses, “Please, sir, do not make us suffer this punishment for our foolish sin."
Numbers,12,12,Don't let her become like something born dead with half its flesh eaten away.”
Numbers,12,13,"So Moses cried out to the Lord , “O God, heal her!”"
Numbers,12,14," The Lord answered, “If her father had spit in her face, she would have to bear her disgrace for seven days. So let her be shut out of the camp for a week, and after that she can be brought back in.”"
Numbers,12,15,"Miriam was shut out of the camp for seven days, and the people did not move on until she was brought back in."
Numbers,12,16,Then they left Hazeroth and set up camp in the wilderness of Paran.
Numbers,13,1,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Numbers,13,2,"“Choose one of the leaders from each of the twelve tribes and send them as spies to explore the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the Israelites.”"
Numbers,14,1,All night long the people cried out in distress.
Numbers,14,2,"They complained against Moses and Aaron, and said, “It would have been better to die in Egypt or even here in the wilderness!"
Numbers,14,3,"Why is the Lord taking us into that land? We will be killed in battle, and our wives and children will be captured. Wouldn't it be better to go back to Egypt?”"
Numbers,14,4,"So they said to one another, “Let's choose a leader and go back to Egypt!”"
Numbers,14,5,Then Moses and Aaron bowed to the ground in front of all the people.
Numbers,14,6,"And Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, two of the spies, tore their clothes in sorrow"
Numbers,14,7,"and said to the people, “The land we explored is an excellent land."
Numbers,14,8,"If the Lord is pleased with us, he will take us there and give us that rich and fertile land."
Numbers,14,9,Do not rebel against the Lord and don't be afraid of the people who live there. We will conquer them easily. The Lord is with us and has defeated the gods who protected them; so don't be afraid.”
Numbers,14,10,"The whole community was threatening to stone them to death, but suddenly the people saw the dazzling light of the Lord 's presence appear over the Tent."
Numbers,14,11,"The Lord said to Moses, “How much longer will these people reject me? How much longer will they refuse to trust in me, even though I have performed so many miracles among them?"
Numbers,14,12,"I will send an epidemic and destroy them, but I will make you the father of a nation that is larger and more powerful than they are!”"
Numbers,14,13," But Moses said to the Lord , “You brought these people out of Egypt by your power. When the Egyptians hear what you have done to your people,"
Numbers,14,14,"they will tell it to the people who live in this land. These people have already heard that you, Lord , are with us, that you appear in plain sight when your cloud stops over us, and that you go before us in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night."
Numbers,14,15,"Now if you kill all your people, the nations who have heard of your fame will say"
Numbers,14,16,that you killed your people in the wilderness because you were not able to bring them into the land you promised to give them.
Numbers,14,17,"So now, Lord , I pray, show us your power and do what you promised when you said,"
Numbers,14,18,"‘I, the Lord , am not easily angered, and I show great love and faithfulness and forgive sin and rebellion. Yet I will not fail to punish children and grandchildren to the third and fourth generation for the sins of their parents.’"
Numbers,14,19,"And now, Lord , according to the greatness of your unchanging love, forgive, I pray, the sin of these people, just as you have forgiven them ever since they left Egypt.”"
Numbers,14,20,"The Lord answered, “I will forgive them, as you have asked."
Numbers,14,21,"But I promise that as surely as I live and as surely as my presence fills the earth,"
Numbers,14,22,"none of these people will live to enter that land. They have seen the dazzling light of my presence and the miracles that I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness, but they have tried my patience over and over again and have refused to obey me."
Numbers,14,23,They will never enter the land which I promised to their ancestors. None of those who have rejected me will ever enter it.
Numbers,14,24,"But because my servant Caleb has a different attitude and has remained loyal to me, I will bring him into the land which he explored, and his descendants will possess the land"
Numbers,14,25,in whose valleys the Amalekites and the Canaanites now live. Turn back tomorrow and go into the wilderness in the direction of the Gulf of Aqaba.”
Numbers,14,26,"The Lord said to Moses and Aaron,"
Numbers,14,27,“How much longer are these wicked people going to complain against me? I have heard enough of these complaints!
Numbers,14,28,"Now give them this answer: ‘I swear that as surely as I live, I will do to you just what you have asked. I, the Lord , have spoken."
Numbers,14,29,"You will die and your corpses will be scattered across this wilderness. Because you have complained against me, none of you over twenty years of age will enter that land."
Numbers,14,30,"I promised to let you live there, but not one of you will, except Caleb and Joshua."
Numbers,14,31,"You said that your children would be captured, but I will bring them into the land that you rejected, and it will be their home."
Numbers,14,32,You will die here in this wilderness.
Numbers,14,33,"Your children will wander in the wilderness for forty years, suffering for your unfaithfulness, until the last one of you dies."
Numbers,14,34,"You will suffer the consequences of your sin for forty years, one year for each of the forty days you spent exploring the land. You will know what it means to have me against you!"
Numbers,14,35,"I swear that I will do this to you wicked people who have gathered together against me. Here in the wilderness every one of you will die. I, the Lord , have spoken.’”"
Numbers,15,1,The Lord gave Moses
Numbers,15,2,the following regulations for the people of Israel to observe in the land that he was going to give them.
Numbers,15,3,"A bull, a ram, a sheep, or a goat may be presented to the Lord as a burnt offering or as a sacrifice in fulfillment of a vow or as a freewill offering or as an offering at your regular religious festivals; the odor of these food offerings is pleasing to the Lord."
Numbers,17,1,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Numbers,17,2,"“Tell the people of Israel to give you twelve walking sticks, one from the leader of each tribe. Write each man's name on his stick"
Numbers,17,3,and then write Aaron's name on the stick representing Levi. There will be one stick for each tribal leader.
Numbers,17,4,"Take them to the Tent of my presence and put them in front of the Covenant Box, where I meet you."
Numbers,17,5,Then the stick of the man I have chosen will sprout. In this way I will put a stop to the constant complaining of these Israelites against you.”
Numbers,17,6,"So Moses spoke to the Israelites, and each of their leaders gave him a stick, one for each tribe, twelve in all, and Aaron's stick was put with them."
Numbers,17,7,Moses then put all the sticks in the Tent in front of the Lord 's Covenant Box.
Numbers,17,8," The next day, when Moses went into the Tent, he saw that Aaron's stick, representing the tribe of Levi, had sprouted. It had budded, blossomed, and produced ripe almonds!"
Numbers,17,9,"Moses took all the sticks and showed them to the Israelites. They saw what had happened, and each leader took his own stick back."
Numbers,17,10,"The Lord said to Moses, “Put Aaron's stick back in front of the Covenant Box. It is to be kept as a warning to the rebel Israelites that they will die unless their complaining stops.”"
Numbers,17,11,Moses did as the Lord commanded.
Numbers,17,12,"The people of Israel said to Moses, “Then that's the end of us!"
Numbers,17,13,"If anyone who even comes near the Tent must die, then we are all as good as dead!”"
Numbers,18,1,"The Lord said to Aaron, “You, your sons, and the Levites must suffer the consequences of any guilt connected with serving in the Tent of my presence; but only you and your sons will suffer the consequences of service in the priesthood."
Numbers,18,2,"Bring in your relatives, the tribe of Levi, to work with you and help you while you and your sons are serving at the Tent."
Numbers,18,3,"They are to fulfill their duties to you and their responsibilities for the Tent, but they must not have any contact with sacred objects in the Holy Place or with the altar. If they do, both they and you will be put to death."
Numbers,18,4,"They are to work with you and fulfill their responsibilities for all the service in the Tent, but no unqualified person may work with you."
Numbers,18,5,"You and your sons alone must fulfill the responsibilities for the Holy Place and the altar, so that my anger will not again break out against the people of Israel."
Numbers,18,6,"I am the one who has chosen your relatives the Levites from among the Israelites as a gift to you. They are dedicated to me, so that they can carry out their duties in the Tent."
Numbers,18,7,"But you and your sons alone shall fulfill all the responsibilities of the priesthood that concern the altar and what is in the Most Holy Place. These things are your responsibility, because I have given you the gift of the priesthood. Any unqualified person who comes near the sacred objects shall be put to death.”"
Numbers,18,8,"The Lord said to Aaron, “Remember that I am giving you all the special contributions made to me that are not burned as sacrifices. I am giving them to you and to your descendants as the part assigned to you forever."
Numbers,18,9,"Of the most sacred offerings not burned on the altar, the following belong to you: the grain offerings, the sin offerings, and the repayment offerings. Everything that is presented to me as a sacred offering belongs to you and your sons."
Numbers,18,10,"You must eat these things in a holy place, and only males may eat them; consider them holy."
Numbers,18,11,"“In addition, any other special contributions that the Israelites present to me shall be yours. I am giving them to you, your sons, and your daughters for all time to come. Every member of your family who is ritually clean may eat them."
Numbers,18,12,"“I am giving you all the best of the first produce which the Israelites give me each year: olive oil, wine, and grain."
Numbers,18,13,It all belongs to you. Every member of your family who is ritually clean may eat it.
Numbers,18,14, “Everything in Israel that has been unconditionally dedicated to me belongs to you.
Numbers,18,15,"“Every first-born child or animal that the Israelites present to me belongs to you. But you must accept payment to buy back every first-born child, and must also accept payment for every first-born animal that is ritually unclean."
Numbers,18,16,"Children shall be bought back at the age of one month for the fixed price of five pieces of silver, according to the official standard."
Numbers,18,17,"But the first-born of cows, sheep, and goats are not to be bought back; they belong completely to me and are to be sacrificed. Throw their blood against the altar and burn their fat as a food offering, an odor pleasing to me."
Numbers,18,18,"The meat from them belongs to you, like the breast and the right hind leg of the special offering."
Numbers,18,19,"“I am giving to you, to your sons, and to your daughters, for all time to come, all the special contributions which the Israelites present to me. This is an unbreakable covenant that I have made with you and your descendants.”"
Numbers,18,20,"The Lord said to Aaron, “You will not receive any property that can be inherited, and no part of the land of Israel will be assigned to you. I, the Lord , am all you need.”"
Numbers,18,21," The Lord said, “I have given to the Levites every tithe that the people of Israel present to me. This is in payment for their service in taking care of the Tent of my presence."
Numbers,18,22,The other Israelites must no longer approach the Tent and in this way bring on themselves the penalty of death.
Numbers,18,23,"From now on only the Levites will take care of the Tent and bear the full responsibility for it. This is a permanent rule that applies also to your descendants. The Levites shall have no permanent property in Israel,"
Numbers,18,24,because I have given to them as their possession the tithe which the Israelites present to me as a special contribution. That is why I told them that they would have no permanent property in Israel.”
Numbers,18,25,The Lord commanded Moses
Numbers,18,26,"to say to the Levites: “When you receive from the Israelites the tithe that the Lord gives you as your possession, you must present a tenth of it as a special contribution to the Lord."
Numbers,18,27,This special contribution will be considered as the equivalent of the offering which the farmer makes of new grain and new wine.
Numbers,18,28,In this way you also will present the special contribution that belongs to the Lord from all the tithes which you receive from the Israelites. You are to give this special contribution for the Lord to Aaron the priest.
Numbers,18,29,Give it from the best that you receive.
Numbers,18,30,"When you have presented the best part, you may keep the rest, just as the farmer keeps what is left after he makes his offering."
Numbers,18,31,"You and your families may eat the rest anywhere, because it is your wages for your service in the Tent."
Numbers,18,32,"You will not become guilty when you eat it, as long as you have presented the best of it to the Lord . But be sure not to profane the sacred gifts of the Israelites by eating any of the gifts before the best part is offered; if you do, you will be put to death.”"
Numbers,19,1,The Lord commanded Moses and Aaron
Numbers,19,2,"to give the Israelites the following regulations. Bring to Moses and Aaron a red cow which has no defects and which has never been worked,"
Numbers,19,3,and they will give it to Eleazar the priest. It is to be taken outside the camp and killed in his presence.
Numbers,19,4,Then Eleazar is to take some of its blood and with his finger sprinkle it seven times in the direction of the Tent.
Numbers,19,5,"The whole animal, including skin, meat, blood, and intestines, is to be burned in the presence of the priest."
Numbers,19,6,"Then he is to take some cedar wood, a sprig of hyssop, and a red cord and throw them into the fire."
Numbers,19,7,"After that, he is to wash his clothes and pour water over himself, and then he may enter the camp; but he remains ritually unclean until evening."
Numbers,19,8,"The one who burned the cow must also wash his clothes and pour water over himself, but he also remains unclean until evening."
Numbers,19,9,"Then someone who is ritually clean is to collect the ashes of the cow and put them in a ritually clean place outside the camp, where they are to be kept for the Israelite community to use in preparing the water for removing ritual uncleanness. This ritual is performed to remove sin."
Numbers,19,10,"The one who collected the ashes must wash his clothes, but he remains unclean until evening. This regulation is valid for all time to come, both for the Israelites and for the foreigners living among them."
Numbers,19,11,Those who touch a corpse are ritually unclean for seven days.
Numbers,19,12,"They must purify themselves with the water for purification on the third day and on the seventh day, and then they will be clean. But if they do not purify themselves on both the third and the seventh day, they will not be clean."
Numbers,19,13,"Those who touch a corpse and do not purify themselves remain unclean, because the water for purification has not been thrown over them. They defile the Lord 's Tent, and they will no longer be considered God's people."
Numbers,19,14,"In the case of a person who dies in a tent, anyone who is in the tent at the time of death or who enters it becomes ritually unclean for seven days."
Numbers,19,15,Every jar and pot in the tent that has no lid on it also becomes unclean.
Numbers,19,16,"If any touch a person who has been killed or has died a natural death outdoors or if any touch a human bone or a grave, they become unclean for seven days."
Numbers,19,17,"To remove the uncleanness, some ashes from the red cow which was burned to remove sin shall be taken and put in a pot, and fresh water added."
Numbers,19,18,"In the first case, someone who is ritually clean is to take a sprig of hyssop, dip it in the water, and sprinkle the tent, everything in it, and the people who were there. In the second case, someone who is ritually clean is to sprinkle the water on those who had touched the human bone or the dead body or the grave."
Numbers,19,19,"On the third day and on the seventh the person who is ritually clean is to sprinkle the water on the unclean persons. On the seventh day he is to purify those, who, after washing their clothes and pouring water over themselves, become ritually clean at sunset."
Numbers,19,20,"Those who have become ritually unclean and do not purify themselves remain unclean, because the water for purification has not been thrown over them. They defile the Lord 's Tent and will no longer be considered God's people."
Numbers,19,21,You are to observe this rule for all time to come. The person who sprinkles the water for purification must also wash his clothes; anyone who touches the water remains ritually unclean until evening.
Numbers,19,22,"Whatever an unclean person touches is unclean, and anyone else who touches it remains unclean until evening."
Numbers,20,1,In the first month the whole community of Israel came to the wilderness of Zin and camped at Kadesh. There Miriam died and was buried.
Numbers,20,2," There was no water where they camped, so the people gathered around Moses and Aaron"
Numbers,20,3,and complained: “It would have been better if we had died in front of the Lord 's Tent along with the other Israelites.
Numbers,20,4,Why have you brought us out into this wilderness? Just so that we can die here with our animals?
Numbers,20,5,"Why did you bring us out of Egypt into this miserable place where nothing will grow? There's no grain, no figs, no grapes, no pomegranates. There is not even any water to drink!”"
Numbers,20,6,"Moses and Aaron moved away from the people and stood at the entrance of the Tent. They bowed down with their faces to the ground, and the dazzling light of the Lord 's presence appeared to them."
Numbers,20,7,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Numbers,20,8,"“Take the stick that is in front of the Covenant Box, and then you and Aaron assemble the whole community. There in front of them all speak to that rock over there, and water will gush out of it. In this way you will bring water out of the rock for the people, for them and their animals to drink.”"
Numbers,20,9,"Moses went and got the stick, as the Lord had commanded."
Numbers,20,10,"He and Aaron assembled the whole community in front of the rock, and Moses said, “Listen, you rebels! Do we have to get water out of this rock for you?”"
Numbers,20,11,"Then Moses raised the stick and struck the rock twice with it, and a great stream of water gushed out, and all the people and animals drank."
Numbers,20,12,"But the Lord reprimanded Moses and Aaron. He said, “Because you did not have enough faith to acknowledge my holy power before the people of Israel, you will not lead them into the land that I promised to give them.”"
Numbers,20,13,"This happened at Meribah, where the people of Israel complained against the Lord and where he showed them that he is holy."
Numbers,20,14,"Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom. They said, “This message is from your kinsmen, the tribes of Israel. You know the hardships we have suffered,"
Numbers,20,15,"how our ancestors went to Egypt, where we lived many years. The Egyptians mistreated our ancestors and us,"
Numbers,20,16,"and we cried to the Lord for help. He heard our cry and sent an angel, who led us out of Egypt. Now we are at Kadesh, a town at the border of your territory."
Numbers,20,17,"Please permit us to pass through your land. We and our cattle will not leave the road or go into your fields or vineyards, and we will not drink from your wells. We will stay on the main road until we are out of your territory.”"
Numbers,20,18,"But the Edomites answered, “We refuse to let you pass through our country! If you try, we will march out and attack you.”"
Numbers,20,19,"The people of Israel said, “We will stay on the main road, and if we or our animals drink any of your water, we will pay for it—all we want is to pass through.”"
Numbers,20,20,"The Edomites repeated, “We refuse!” and they marched out with a powerful army to attack the people of Israel."
Numbers,20,21,"Because the Edomites would not let the Israelites pass through their territory, the Israelites turned and went another way."
Numbers,20,22,"The whole community of Israel left Kadesh and arrived at Mount Hor,"
Numbers,20,23,"on the border of Edom. There the Lord said to Moses and Aaron,"
Numbers,20,24,"“Aaron is not going to enter the land which I promised to give to Israel; he is going to die, because the two of you rebelled against my command at Meribah."
Numbers,20,25,"Take Aaron and his son Eleazar up Mount Hor,"
Numbers,20,26,and there remove Aaron's priestly robes and put them on Eleazar. Aaron is going to die there.”
Numbers,20,27,"Moses did what the Lord had commanded. They went up Mount Hor in the sight of the whole community,"
Numbers,20,28,"and Moses removed Aaron's priestly robes and put them on Eleazar. There on the top of the mountain Aaron died, and Moses and Eleazar came back down."
Numbers,20,29,"The whole community learned that Aaron had died, and they all mourned for him for thirty days."
Numbers,21,1," When the Canaanite king of Arad in the southern part of Canaan heard that the Israelites were coming by way of Atharim, he attacked them and captured some of them."
Numbers,21,2,"Then the Israelites made a vow to the Lord : “If you will let us conquer these people, we will unconditionally dedicate them and their cities to you and will destroy them.”"
Numbers,21,3,"The Lord heard them and helped them conquer the Canaanites. So the Israelites completely destroyed them and their cities, and named the place Hormah."
Numbers,21,4," The Israelites left Mount Hor by the road that leads to the Gulf of Aqaba, in order to go around the territory of Edom. But on the way the people lost their patience"
Numbers,21,5,"and spoke against God and Moses. They complained, “Why did you bring us out of Egypt to die in this desert, where there is no food or water? We can't stand any more of this miserable food!”"
Numbers,21,6,"Then the Lord sent poisonous snakes among the people, and many Israelites were bitten and died."
Numbers,21,7,"The people came to Moses and said, “We sinned when we spoke against the Lord and against you. Now pray to the Lord to take these snakes away.” So Moses prayed for the people."
Numbers,21,8,"Then the Lord told Moses to make a metal snake and put it on a pole, so that anyone who was bitten could look at it and be healed."
Numbers,21,9,So Moses made a bronze snake and put it on a pole. Anyone who had been bitten would look at the bronze snake and be healed.
Numbers,21,10,The Israelites moved on and camped at Oboth.
Numbers,21,11,"After leaving that place, they camped at the ruins of Abarim in the wilderness east of Moabite territory."
Numbers,21,12,Then they camped in Zered Valley.
Numbers,21,13,"From there they moved again and camped on the north side of the Arnon River, in the wilderness which extends into Amorite territory. (The Arnon was the border between the Moabites and the Amorites.)"
Numbers,21,14,"That is why The Book of the Lord 's Battles speaks of “… the town of Waheb in the area of Suphah, and the valleys; the Arnon River,"
Numbers,21,15,and the slope of the valleys that extend to the town of Ar and toward the border of Moab.”
Numbers,21,16,"From there they went on to a place called Wells, where the Lord said to Moses, “Bring the people together, and I will give them water.”"
Numbers,21,17,"At that time the people of Israel sang this song: “Wells, produce your water; And we will greet it with a song—"
Numbers,21,18,"The well dug by princes And by leaders of the people, Dug with a royal scepter And with their walking sticks.” They moved from the wilderness to Mattanah,"
Numbers,21,19,"and from there they went on to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth,"
Numbers,21,20,"and from Bamoth to the valley in the territory of the Moabites, below the top of Mount Pisgah, looking out over the desert."
Numbers,21,21,Then the people of Israel sent messengers to the Amorite king Sihon to say:
Numbers,21,22,"“Let us pass through your land. We and our cattle will not leave the road and go into your fields or vineyards, and we will not drink water from your wells; we will stay on the main road until we are out of your territory.”"
Numbers,21,23,But Sihon would not permit the people of Israel to pass through his territory. He gathered his army and went out to Jahaz in the wilderness and attacked the Israelites.
Numbers,21,24,"But the Israelites killed many of the enemy in battle and occupied their land from the Arnon River north to the Jabbok, that is, to the Ammonites, because the Ammonite border was strongly defended."
Numbers,21,25,"So the people of Israel captured all the Amorite cities, including Heshbon and all the surrounding towns, and settled in them."
Numbers,21,26,"Heshbon was the capital city of the Amorite king Sihon, who had fought against the former king of Moab and had captured all his land as far as the Arnon River."
Numbers,21,27,"That is why the poets sing, “Come to Heshbon, to King Sihon's city! We want to see it rebuilt and restored."
Numbers,21,28, Once from this city of Heshbon Sihon's army went forth like a fire; It destroyed the city of Ar in Moab And devoured the hills of the upper Arnon.
Numbers,21,29,"How terrible for you, people of Moab! You worshipers of Chemosh are brought to ruin! Your god let the men become refugees, And the women became captives of the Amorite king."
Numbers,21,30,"But now their descendants are destroyed, All the way from Heshbon to Dibon, From Nashim to Nophah, near Medeba.”"
Numbers,21,31,"So the people of Israel settled in the territory of the Amorites,"
Numbers,21,32,and Moses sent men to find the best way to attack the city of Jazer. The Israelites captured it and its surrounding towns and drove out the Amorites living there.
Numbers,21,33,"Then the Israelites turned and took the road to Bashan, and King Og of Bashan marched out with his army to attack them at Edrei."
Numbers,21,34,"The Lord said to Moses, “Do not be afraid of him. I will give you victory over him, all his people, and his land. Do to him what you did to Sihon, the Amorite king who ruled at Heshbon.”"
Numbers,21,35,"So the Israelites killed Og, his sons, and all his people, leaving no survivors, and then they occupied his land."
Numbers,22,1,The Israelites moved on and set up camp in the plains of Moab east of the Jordan and opposite Jericho.
Numbers,22,2,"When the king of Moab, Balak son of Zippor, heard what the Israelites had done to the Amorites and how many Israelites there were,"
Numbers,22,3,he and all his people became terrified.
Numbers,22,4,"The Moabites said to the leaders of the Midianites, “This horde will soon destroy everything around us, like a bull eating the grass in a pasture.” So King Balak"
Numbers,22,5,"sent messengers to summon Balaam son of Beor, who was at Pethor near the Euphrates River in the land of Amaw. They brought him this message from Balak: “I want you to know that a whole nation has come from Egypt; its people are spreading out everywhere and threatening to take over our land."
Numbers,22,6,"They outnumber us, so please come and put a curse on them for me. Then perhaps we will be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land. I know that when you pronounce a blessing, people are blessed, and when you pronounce a curse, they are placed under a curse.”"
Numbers,22,7,"So the Moabite and Midianite leaders took with them the payment for the curse, went to Balaam, and gave him Balak's message."
Numbers,22,8,"Balaam said to them, “Spend the night here, and tomorrow I will report to you whatever the Lord tells me.” So the Moabite leaders stayed with Balaam."
Numbers,22,9,"God came to Balaam and asked, “Who are these people that are staying with you?”"
Numbers,22,10,"He answered, “King Balak of Moab has sent them to tell me"
Numbers,22,11,"that a people who came from Egypt has spread out over the whole land. He wants me to curse them for him, so that he can fight them and drive them out.”"
Numbers,22,12,"God said to Balaam, “Do not go with them, and do not put a curse on the people of Israel, because they have my blessing.”"
Numbers,22,13,"The next morning Balaam went to Balak's messengers and said, “Go back home; the Lord has refused to let me go with you.”"
Numbers,22,14,So they returned to Balak and told him that Balaam had refused to come with them.
Numbers,22,15,"Then Balak sent a larger number of leaders, who were more important than the first."
Numbers,22,16,They went to Balaam and gave him this message from Balak: “Please don't let anything prevent you from coming to me!
Numbers,22,17,I will reward you richly and do anything you say. Please come and curse these people for me.”
Numbers,22,18,"But Balaam answered, “Even if Balak gave me all the silver and gold in his palace, I could not disobey the command of the Lord my God in even the smallest matter."
Numbers,22,19,"But please spend the night, as the others did, so that I may learn whether or not the Lord has something else to tell me.”"
Numbers,22,20,"That night God came to Balaam and said, “If these men have come to ask you to go with them, get ready and go, but do only what I tell you.”"
Numbers,22,21,So the next morning Balaam saddled his donkey and went with the Moabite leaders.
Numbers,22,22,"God was angry that Balaam was going, and as Balaam was riding along on his donkey, accompanied by his two servants, the angel of the Lord stood in the road to bar his way."
Numbers,22,23,"When the donkey saw the angel standing there holding a sword, it left the road and turned into the fields. Balaam beat the donkey and brought it back onto the road."
Numbers,22,24,Then the angel stood where the road narrowed between two vineyards and had a stone wall on each side.
Numbers,22,25,"When the donkey saw the angel, it moved over against the wall and crushed Balaam's foot against it. Again Balaam beat the donkey."
Numbers,22,26,Once more the angel moved ahead; he stood in a narrow place where there was no room at all to pass on either side.
Numbers,22,27,"This time, when the donkey saw the angel, it lay down. Balaam lost his temper and began to beat the donkey with his stick."
Numbers,22,28,"Then the Lord gave the donkey the power of speech, and it said to Balaam, “What have I done to you? Why have you beaten me these three times?”"
Numbers,22,29,"Balaam answered, “Because you have made a fool of me! If I had a sword, I would kill you.”"
Numbers,22,30,"The donkey replied, “Am I not the same donkey on which you have ridden all your life? Have I ever treated you like this before?” “No,” he answered."
Numbers,22,31,Then the Lord let Balaam see the angel standing there with his sword; and Balaam threw himself face downward on the ground.
Numbers,22,32,"The angel demanded, “Why have you beaten your donkey three times like this? I have come to bar your way, because you should not be making this journey."
Numbers,22,33,"But your donkey saw me and turned aside three times. If it hadn't, I would have killed you and spared the donkey.”"
Numbers,22,34,"Balaam replied, “I have sinned. I did not know that you were standing in the road to oppose me; but now if you think it is wrong for me to go on, I will return home.”"
Numbers,22,35,"But the angel said, “Go on with these men, but say only what I tell you to say.” So Balaam went on with them."
Numbers,22,36,"When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went to meet him at Ar, a city on the Arnon River at the border of Moab."
Numbers,22,37,"Balak said to him, “Why didn't you come when I sent for you the first time? Did you think I wasn't able to reward you enough?”"
Numbers,22,38,"Balaam answered, “I came, didn't I? But now, what power do I have? I can say only what God tells me to say.”"
Numbers,22,39,"So Balaam went with Balak to the town of Huzoth,"
Numbers,22,40,where Balak slaughtered cattle and sheep and gave some of the meat to Balaam and the leaders who were with him.
Numbers,22,41,"The next morning Balak took Balaam up to Bamoth Baal, from where Balaam could see a part of the people of Israel."
Numbers,23,1,"He said to Balak, “Build seven altars here for me, and bring me seven bulls and seven rams.”"
Numbers,23,2,"Balak did as he was told, and he and Balaam offered a bull and a ram on each altar."
Numbers,23,3,"Then Balaam said to Balak, “Stand here by your burnt offering, while I go to see whether or not the Lord will meet me. I will tell you whatever he reveals to me.” So he went alone to the top of a hill,"
Numbers,23,4,"and God met him. Balaam said to him, “I have built the seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each.”"
Numbers,23,5,The Lord told Balaam what to say and sent him back to Balak to give him his message.
Numbers,23,6,So he went back and found Balak still standing by his burnt offering with all the leaders of Moab.
Numbers,23,7,"Balaam uttered this prophecy: “Balak king of Moab has brought me From Syria, from the eastern mountains. ‘Come speak for me,’ he said. ‘Put a curse on the people of Israel.’"
Numbers,23,8,"How can I curse what God has not cursed, Or speak of doom when the Lord has not?"
Numbers,23,9,From the high rocks I can see them; I can watch them from the hills. They are a nation that lives alone; They know they are blessed more than other nations.
Numbers,23,10,The descendants of Israel are like the dust— There are too many of them to be counted. Let me end my days like one of God's people; Let me die in peace like the righteous.”
Numbers,23,11,"Then Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I brought you here to curse my enemies, but all you have done is bless them.”"
Numbers,23,12,"He answered, “I can say only what the Lord tells me to say.”"
Numbers,23,13,"Then Balak said to Balaam, “Come with me to another place from which you can see only some of the Israelites. Curse them for me from there.”"
Numbers,23,14,He took him to the field of Zophim on the top of Mount Pisgah. There also he built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each of them.
Numbers,23,15,"Balaam said to Balak, “Stand here by your burnt offering, and I will meet God over there.”"
Numbers,23,16,"The Lord met Balaam, told him what to say, and sent him back to Balak to give him his message."
Numbers,23,17,"So he went back and found Balak still standing by his burnt offering, with the leaders of Moab. Balak asked what the Lord had said,"
Numbers,23,18,"and Balaam uttered this prophecy: “Come, Balak son of Zippor, And listen to what I have to say."
Numbers,23,19,"God is not like people, who lie; He is not a human who changes his mind. Whatever he promises, he does; He speaks, and it is done."
Numbers,23,20,"I have been instructed to bless, And when God blesses, I cannot call it back."
Numbers,23,21,I foresee that Israel's future Will bring her no misfortune or trouble. The Lord their God is with them; They proclaim that he is their king.
Numbers,23,22,God has brought them out of Egypt; He fights for them like a wild ox.
Numbers,23,23,"There is no magic charm, no witchcraft, That can be used against the nation of Israel. Now people will say about Israel, ‘Look what God has done!’"
Numbers,23,24,"The nation of Israel is like a mighty lion: It doesn't rest until it has torn and devoured, Until it has drunk the blood of those it has killed.”"
Numbers,23,25,"Then Balak said to Balaam, “You refuse to curse the people of Israel, but at least don't bless them!”"
Numbers,23,26,"Balaam answered, “Didn't I tell you that I had to do everything that the Lord told me?”"
Numbers,23,27,"Balak said, “Come with me, and I will take you to another place. Perhaps God will be willing to let you curse them for me from there.”"
Numbers,23,28,So he took Balaam to the top of Mount Peor overlooking the desert.
Numbers,23,29,"Balaam said to him, “Build seven altars for me here and bring me seven bulls and seven rams.”"
Numbers,23,30,"Balak did as he was told, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar."
Numbers,24,1,"By now Balaam knew that the Lord wanted him to bless the people of Israel, so he did not go to look for omens, as he had done before. He turned toward the desert"
Numbers,24,2,"and saw the people of Israel camped tribe by tribe. The spirit of God took control of him,"
Numbers,24,3,"and he uttered this prophecy: “The message of Balaam son of Beor, The words of the man who can see clearly,"
Numbers,24,4,Who can hear what God is saying. With staring eyes I see in a trance A vision from Almighty God.
Numbers,24,5,"The tents of Israel are beautiful,"
Numbers,24,6,"Like long rows of palms Or gardens beside a river, Like aloes planted by the Lord Or cedars beside the water."
Numbers,24,7,"They will have abundant rainfall And plant their seed in well-watered fields. Their king shall be greater than Agag, And his rule shall be extended far and wide."
Numbers,24,8,"God brought them out of Egypt; He fights for them like a wild ox. They devour their enemies, Crush their bones, smash their arrows."
Numbers,24,9," The nation is like a mighty lion; When it is sleeping, no one dares wake it. Whoever blesses Israel will be blessed, And whoever curses Israel will be cursed.”"
Numbers,24,10,"Balak clenched his fists in anger and said to Balaam, “I called you to curse my enemies, but three times now you have blessed them instead."
Numbers,24,11,"Now get on home! I promised to reward you, but the Lord has kept you from getting the reward.”"
Numbers,24,12,"Balaam answered, “I told the messengers you sent to me that"
Numbers,24,13,"even if you gave me all the silver and gold in your palace, I could not disobey the command of the Lord by doing anything of myself. I will say only what the Lord tells me to say.”"
Numbers,24,14,"Balaam said to Balak, “Now I am going back to my own people, but before I go, I am warning you what the people of Israel will do to your people in the future.”"
Numbers,24,15,"Then he uttered this prophecy: “The message of Balaam son of Beor, The words of the man who can see clearly,"
Numbers,24,16,Who can hear what God is saying And receive the knowledge that comes from the Most High. With staring eyes I see in a trance A vision from Almighty God.
Numbers,24,17,"I look into the future, And I see the nation of Israel. A king, like a bright star, will arise in that nation. Like a comet he will come from Israel. He will strike the leaders of Moab And beat down all the people of Seth."
Numbers,24,18,"He will conquer his enemies in Edom And make their land his property, While Israel continues victorious."
Numbers,24,19,The nation of Israel will trample them down And wipe out the last survivors.”
Numbers,24,20,"Then in his vision Balaam saw the Amalekites and uttered this prophecy: “Amalek was the most powerful nation of all, But at the end it will perish forever.”"
Numbers,24,21,"In his vision he saw the Kenites, and uttered this prophecy: “The place where you live is secure, Safe as a nest set high on a cliff,"
Numbers,24,22,But you Kenites will be destroyed When Assyria takes you captive.”
Numbers,24,23,Balaam uttered this prophecy: “Who are these people gathering in the north?
Numbers,24,24,"Invaders will sail from Cyprus; They will conquer Assyria and Eber, But they, in turn, will perish forever.”"
Numbers,24,25,"Then Balaam got ready and went back home, and Balak went on his way."
Numbers,25,1,"When the Israelites were camped at Acacia Valley, the men began to have sexual intercourse with the Moabite women who were there."
Numbers,25,2,"These women invited them to sacrificial feasts, where the god of Moab was worshiped. The Israelites ate the food and worshiped the god"
Numbers,25,3,Baal of Peor. So the Lord was angry with them
Numbers,25,4,"and said to Moses, “Take all the leaders of Israel and, in obedience to me, execute them in broad daylight, and then I will no longer be angry with the people.”"
Numbers,25,5,"Moses said to the officials, “Each of you is to kill every man in your tribe who has become a worshiper of Baal of Peor.”"
Numbers,25,6,"One of the Israelites took a Midianite woman into his tent in the sight of Moses and the whole community, while they were mourning at the entrance of the Tent of the Lord 's presence."
Numbers,25,7,"When Phinehas, the son of Eleazar and grandson of Aaron the priest, saw this, he got up and left the assembly. He took a spear,"
Numbers,25,8,"followed the man and the woman into the tent, and drove the spear through both of them. In this way the epidemic that was destroying Israel was stopped,"
Numbers,25,9,but it had already killed twenty-four thousand people.
Numbers,25,10,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Numbers,25,11,"“Because of what Phinehas has done, I am no longer angry with the people of Israel. He refused to tolerate the worship of any god but me, and that is why I did not destroy them in my anger."
Numbers,25,12,So tell him that I am making a covenant with him that is valid for all time to come.
Numbers,25,13,"He and his descendants are permanently established as priests, because he did not tolerate any rivals to me and brought about forgiveness for the people's sin.”"
Numbers,25,14,"The name of the Israelite who was killed with the Midianite woman was Zimri son of Salu, the head of a family in the tribe of Simeon."
Numbers,25,15,"The woman's name was Cozbi. Zur, her father, was chief of a group of Midianite clans."
Numbers,25,16,"The Lord commanded Moses,"
Numbers,25,17,"“Attack the Midianites and destroy them,"
Numbers,25,18,"because of the evil they did to you when they deceived you at Peor, and because of Cozbi, who was killed at the time of the epidemic at Peor.”"
Numbers,26,1," After the epidemic the Lord said to Moses and Eleazar son of Aaron,"
Numbers,26,2,"“Take a census by families of the whole community of Israel, of all men twenty years old or older who are fit for military service.”"
Numbers,27,1,"Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah were the daughters of Zelophehad son of Hepher, son of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, son of Joseph."
Numbers,27,2,"They went and stood before Moses, Eleazar the priest, the leaders, and the whole community at the entrance of the Tent of the Lord 's presence and said,"
Numbers,27,3,"“Our father died in the wilderness without leaving any sons. He was not among the followers of Korah, who rebelled against the Lord ; he died because of his own sin."
Numbers,27,4,"Just because he had no sons, why should our father's name disappear from Israel? Give us property among our father's relatives.”"
Numbers,27,5,"Moses presented their case to the Lord,"
Numbers,27,6,"and the Lord said to him,"
Numbers,27,7,“What the daughters of Zelophehad request is right; give them property among their father's relatives. Let his inheritance pass on to them.
Numbers,27,8,"Tell the people of Israel that whenever a man dies without leaving a son, his daughter is to inherit his property."
Numbers,27,9,"If he has no daughter, his brothers are to inherit it."
Numbers,27,10,"If he has no brothers, his father's brothers are to inherit it."
Numbers,27,11,"If he has no brothers or uncles, then his nearest relative is to inherit it and hold it as his own property. The people of Israel are to observe this as a legal requirement, just as I, the Lord , have commanded you.”"
Numbers,27,12," The Lord said to Moses, “Go up the Abarim Mountains and look out over the land that I am giving to the Israelites."
Numbers,27,13,"After you have seen it, you will die, as your brother Aaron did,"
Numbers,27,14,"because both of you rebelled against my command in the wilderness of Zin. When the whole community complained against me at Meribah, you refused to acknowledge my holy power before them.” (Meribah is the spring at Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.)"
Numbers,27,15,"Moses prayed,"
Numbers,27,16,"“ Lord God, source of all life, appoint, I pray, a man who can lead the people"
Numbers,27,17,"and can command them in battle, so that your community will not be like sheep without a shepherd.”"
Numbers,27,18," The Lord said to Moses, “Take Joshua son of Nun, a capable man, and place your hands on his head."
Numbers,27,19,"Have him stand in front of Eleazar the priest and the whole community, and there before them all proclaim him as your successor."
Numbers,27,20,"Give him some of your own authority, so that the whole community of Israel will obey him."
Numbers,27,21,"He will depend on Eleazar the priest, who will learn my will by using the Urim and Thummim. In this way Eleazar will direct Joshua and the whole community of Israel in all their affairs.”"
Numbers,27,22,Moses did as the Lord had commanded him. He had Joshua stand before Eleazar the priest and the whole community.
Numbers,27,23,"As the Lord had commanded, Moses put his hands on Joshua's head and proclaimed him as his successor."
Numbers,28,1,The Lord commanded Moses

Numbers,30,1,Moses gave the following instructions to the leaders of the tribes of Israel.
Numbers,30,2,"When a man makes a vow to give something to the Lord or takes an oath to abstain from something, he must not break his promise, but must do everything that he said he would."
Numbers,30,3,"When a young woman still living in her father's house makes a vow to give something to the Lord or promises to abstain from something,"
Numbers,30,4,she must do everything that she vowed or promised unless her father raises an objection when he hears about it.
Numbers,30,5,"But if her father forbids her to fulfill the vow when he hears about it, she is not required to keep it. The Lord will forgive her, because her father refused to let her keep it."
Numbers,30,6,"If an unmarried woman makes a vow, whether deliberately or carelessly, or promises to abstain from something, and then marries,"
Numbers,30,7,she must do everything that she vowed or promised unless her husband raises an objection when he hears about it.
Numbers,30,8,"But if her husband forbids her to fulfill the vow when he hears about it, she is not required to keep it. The Lord will forgive her."
Numbers,30,9,A widow or a divorced woman must keep every vow she makes and every promise to abstain from something.
Numbers,30,10,"If a married woman makes a vow or promises to abstain from something,"
Numbers,30,11,she must do everything that she vowed or promised unless her husband raises an objection when he hears about it.
Numbers,30,12,"But if her husband forbids her to fulfill the vow when he hears about it, she is not required to keep it. The Lord will forgive her, because her husband prevented her from keeping her vow."
Numbers,30,13,Her husband has the right to affirm or to annul any vow or promise that she has made.
Numbers,30,14,"But if, by the day after he hears of the vow, he has raised no objection, she must do everything that she has vowed or promised. He has affirmed the vow by not objecting on the day he heard of it."
Numbers,30,15,"But if he later annuls the vow, he must suffer the consequences for the failure to fulfill the vow."
Numbers,30,16,These are the rules that the Lord gave Moses concerning vows made by an unmarried woman living in her father's house or by a married woman.
Numbers,31,1,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Numbers,31,2,"“Punish the Midianites for what they did to the people of Israel. After you have done that, you will die.”"
Numbers,31,3,"So Moses said to the people, “Get ready for war, so that you can attack Midian and punish them for what they did to the Lord."
Numbers,31,4,From each tribe of Israel send a thousand men to war.”
Numbers,31,5,"So a thousand men were chosen from each tribe, a total of twelve thousand men ready for battle."
Numbers,31,6,"Moses sent them to war under the command of Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest, who took charge of the sacred objects and the trumpets for giving signals."
Numbers,31,7,"They attacked Midian, as the Lord had commanded Moses, and killed all the men,"
Numbers,31,8,"including the five kings of Midian: Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba. They also killed Balaam son of Beor."
Numbers,31,9,"The people of Israel captured the Midianite women and children, took their cattle and their flocks, plundered all their wealth,"
Numbers,31,10,and burned all their cities and camps.
Numbers,31,11,"They took all the loot that they had captured, including the prisoners and the animals,"
Numbers,31,12,"and brought them to Moses and Eleazar and to the community of the people of Israel, who were at the camp on the plains of Moab across the Jordan from Jericho."
Numbers,31,13,"Moses, Eleazar, and all the other leaders of the community went out of the camp to meet the army."
Numbers,31,14,"Moses became angry with the officers, the commanders of battalions and companies, who had returned from the war."
Numbers,31,15,"He asked them, “Why have you kept all the women alive?"
Numbers,31,16,Remember that it was the women who followed Balaam's instructions and at Peor led the people to be unfaithful to the Lord . That was what brought the epidemic on the Lord 's people.
Numbers,31,17,"So now kill every boy and kill every woman who has had sexual intercourse,"
Numbers,31,18,but keep alive for yourselves all the girls and all the women who are virgins.
Numbers,31,19,Now all of you who have killed anyone or have touched a corpse must stay outside the camp for seven days. On the third day and on the seventh day purify yourselves and the women you have captured.
Numbers,31,20,"You must also purify every piece of clothing and everything made of leather, goats' hair, or wood.”"
Numbers,31,21,"Eleazar the priest said to the men who had returned from battle, “These are the regulations that the Lord has given to Moses."
Numbers,32,1,"The tribes of Reuben and Gad had a lot of livestock. When they saw how suitable the land of Jazer and Gilead was for cattle,"
Numbers,32,2,"they went to Moses, Eleazar, and the other leaders of the community and said,"
Numbers,33,1,The following account gives the names of the places where the Israelites set up camp after they left Egypt in their tribes under the leadership of Moses and Aaron.
Numbers,33,2,"At the command of the Lord , Moses wrote down the name of the place each time they set up camp."
Numbers,33,3,"The people of Israel left Egypt on the fifteenth day of the first month of the year, the day after the first Passover. Under the Lord 's protection they left the city of Rameses in full view of the Egyptians,"
Numbers,33,4,"who were burying the first-born sons that the Lord had killed. By doing this, the Lord showed that he was more powerful than the gods of Egypt."
Numbers,33,5,The people of Israel left Rameses and set up camp at Sukkoth.
Numbers,33,6,Their next camp was at Etham on the edge of the desert.
Numbers,33,7,"From there they turned back to Pi Hahiroth, east of Baal Zephon, and camped near Migdol."
Numbers,33,8,They left Pi Hahiroth and passed through the Red Sea into the desert of Shur; after a three days' march they camped at Marah.
Numbers,33,9,"From there they went to Elim, where they camped, because there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees there."
Numbers,33,10,They left Elim and camped near the Gulf of Suez.
Numbers,33,11,Their next camp was in the desert of Sin.
Numbers,33,12,"Then they camped at Dophkah,"
Numbers,33,13,and after that at Alush.
Numbers,33,14,"Next was Rephidim, where there was no water for them to drink."
Numbers,34,1,The Lord gave Moses
Numbers,34,2,"the following instructions for the people of Israel: “When you enter Canaan, the land which I am giving you, the borders of your territory will be as follows."
Numbers,34,3,The southern border will extend from the wilderness of Zin along the border of Edom. It will begin on the east at the southern end of the Dead Sea.
Numbers,34,4,"Then it will turn southward toward Akrabbim Pass and continue on through Zin as far south as Kadesh Barnea. Then it will turn northwest to Hazar Addar and on to Azmon,"
Numbers,34,5,where it will turn toward the valley at the border of Egypt and end at the Mediterranean.
Numbers,34,6,“The western border will be the Mediterranean Sea.
Numbers,34,7,“The northern border will follow a line from the Mediterranean to Mount Hor
Numbers,34,8,and from there to Hamath Pass. It will continue to Zedad
Numbers,34,9,"and to Ziphron, and will end at Hazar Enan."
Numbers,34,10,“The eastern border will follow a line from Hazar Enan to Shepham.
Numbers,34,11,"It will then go south to Harbel, east of Ain, and on to the hills on the eastern shore of Lake Galilee,"
Numbers,34,12,then south along the Jordan River to the Dead Sea. “These will be the four borders of your land.”
Numbers,34,13," So Moses said to the Israelites, “This is the land that you will receive by drawing lots, the land that the Lord has assigned to the nine and one-half tribes."
Numbers,34,14,"The tribes of Reuben and Gad and the eastern half of Manasseh have received their property, divided according to their families,"
Numbers,34,15,"on the eastern side of the Jordan, opposite Jericho.”"
Numbers,34,16,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Numbers,34,17,“Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun will divide the land for the people.
Numbers,34,18,Take also one leader from each tribe to help them divide it.”
Numbers,35,1," In the plains of Moab across the Jordan from Jericho the Lord said to Moses,"
Numbers,35,2,“Tell the Israelites that from the property they receive they must give the Levites some cities to live in and pasture land around the cities.
Numbers,35,3,"These cities will belong to the Levites, and they will live there. The pasture land will be for their cattle and all their other animals."
Numbers,35,4,"The pasture land is to extend outward from the city walls five hundred yards in each direction,"
Numbers,35,5,"so that there is a square area measuring one thousand yards on each side, with the city in the middle."
Numbers,35,6,"You are to give the Levites six cities of refuge to which any of you can escape if you kill someone accidentally. In addition, give them forty-two other cities"
Numbers,35,7,"with their pasture land, making a total of forty-eight."
Numbers,35,8,The number of Levite cities in each tribe is to be determined according to the size of its territory.”
Numbers,35,9, The Lord told Moses
Numbers,35,10,"to say to the people of Israel: “When you cross the Jordan River and enter the land of Canaan,"
Numbers,35,11,you are to choose cities of refuge to which any of you can escape if you kill someone accidentally.
Numbers,35,12,There you will be safe from the dead person's relative who seeks revenge. No one accused of manslaughter is to be put to death without a public trial.
Numbers,35,13,"Choose six cities,"
Numbers,35,14,three east of the Jordan and three in the land of Canaan.
Numbers,35,15,These will serve as cities of refuge for Israelites and for foreigners who are temporary or permanent residents. Anyone who kills someone accidentally can escape to one of them.
Numbers,36,1,"The heads of the families in the clan of Gilead, the son of Machir and grandson of Manasseh son of Joseph, went to Moses and the other leaders."
Numbers,36,2,"They said, “The Lord commanded you to distribute the land to the people of Israel by drawing lots. He also commanded you to give the property of our relative Zelophehad to his daughters."
Numbers,36,3,"But remember, if they marry men of another tribe, their property will then belong to that tribe, and the total allotted to us will be reduced."
Numbers,36,4,"In the Year of Restoration, when all property that has been sold is restored to its original owners, the property of Zelophehad's daughters will be permanently added to the tribe into which they marry and will be lost to our tribe.”"
Numbers,36,5,"So Moses gave the people of Israel the following command from the Lord . He said, “What the tribe of Manasseh says is right,"
Numbers,36,6,and so the Lord says that the daughters of Zelophehad are free to marry anyone they wish but only within their own tribe.
Numbers,36,7,The property of every Israelite will remain attached to his tribe.
Numbers,36,8,"Every woman who inherits property in an Israelite tribe must marry a man belonging to that tribe. In this way all Israelites will inherit the property of their ancestors,"
Numbers,36,9,and the property will not pass from one tribe to another. Each tribe will continue to possess its own property.”
