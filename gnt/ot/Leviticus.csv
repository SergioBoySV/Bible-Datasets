Leviticus,1,1,The Lord called to Moses from the Tent of the Lord 's presence and gave him the following rules
Leviticus,1,2,"for the Israelites to observe when they offer their sacrifices. When you offer an animal sacrifice, it may be one of your cattle or one of your sheep or goats."
Leviticus,1,3,"If you are offering one of your cattle as a burnt offering, you must bring a bull without any defects. You must present it at the entrance of the Tent of the Lord 's presence so that the Lord will accept you."
Leviticus,1,4,"You shall put your hand on its head, and it will be accepted as a sacrifice to take away your sins."
Leviticus,1,5,"You shall kill the bull there, and the Aaronite priests shall present the blood to the Lord and then throw it against all four sides of the altar located at the entrance of the Tent."
Leviticus,1,6,"Then you shall skin the animal and cut it up,"
Leviticus,1,7,and the priests shall arrange firewood on the altar and light it.
Leviticus,1,8,"They shall put on the fire the pieces of the animal, including the head and the fat."
Leviticus,1,9,"You must wash the internal organs and the hind legs, and the officiating priest will burn the whole sacrifice on the altar. The odor of this food offering is pleasing to the Lord."
Leviticus,1,10,"If you are offering one of your sheep or goats, it must be a male without any defects."
Leviticus,1,11,"You shall kill it on the north side of the altar, and the priests shall throw its blood on all four sides of the altar."
Leviticus,1,12,"After you cut it up, the officiating priest shall put on the fire all the parts, including the head and the fat."
Leviticus,1,13,"You must wash the internal organs and the hind legs, and the priest will present the sacrifice to the Lord and burn all of it on the altar. The odor of this food offering is pleasing to the Lord."
Leviticus,1,14,"If you are offering a bird as a burnt offering, it must be a dove or a pigeon."
Leviticus,1,15,"The priest shall present it at the altar, wring its neck, and burn its head on the altar. Its blood shall be drained out against the side of the altar."
Leviticus,1,16,He shall remove the crop and its contents and throw them away on the east side of the altar where the ashes are put.
Leviticus,1,17,"He shall take hold of its wings and tear its body open, without tearing the wings off, and then burn it whole on the altar. The odor of this food offering is pleasing to the Lord."
Leviticus,2,1,"When any of you present an offering of grain to the Lord , you must first grind it into flour. You must put olive oil and incense on it"
Leviticus,2,2,and bring it to the Aaronite priests. The officiating priest shall take a handful of the flour and oil and all of the incense and burn it on the altar as a token that it has all been offered to the Lord . The odor of this food offering is pleasing to the Lord.
Leviticus,2,3,"The rest of the grain offering belongs to the priests; it is very holy, since it is taken from the food offered to the Lord."
Leviticus,2,4,"If the offering is bread baked in an oven, it must be made without yeast. It may be thick loaves made of flour mixed with olive oil or thin cakes brushed with olive oil."
Leviticus,2,5,"If the offering is bread cooked on a griddle, it is to be made of flour mixed with olive oil but without yeast."
Leviticus,2,6,Crumble it up and pour the oil on it when you present it as an offering.
Leviticus,2,7,"If the offering is bread cooked in a pan, it is to be made of flour and olive oil."
Leviticus,2,8,"Bring it as an offering to the Lord and present it to the priest, who will take it to the altar."
Leviticus,2,9,"The priest will take part of it as a token that it has all been offered to the Lord , and he will burn it on the altar. The odor of this food offering is pleasing to the Lord."
Leviticus,2,10,"The rest of the offering belongs to the priests; it is very holy, since it is taken from the food offered to the Lord."
Leviticus,2,11,None of the grain offerings which you present to the Lord may be made with yeast; you must never use yeast or honey in food offered to the Lord.
Leviticus,2,12,"An offering of the first grain that you harvest each year shall be brought to the Lord , but it is not to be burned on the altar."
Leviticus,2,13,"Put salt on every grain offering, because salt represents the covenant between you and God. (You must put salt on all your offerings.)"
Leviticus,2,14,"When you bring to the Lord an offering of the first grain harvested, offer roasted grain or ground meal."
Leviticus,2,15,Add olive oil and put incense on it.
Leviticus,2,16,"The priest will burn that part of the meal and oil that is to serve as a token, and also all the incense, as a food offering to the Lord."
Leviticus,3,1,"When any of you offer one of your cattle as a fellowship offering, it is to be a bull or a cow without any defects."
Leviticus,3,2,You shall put your hand on the head of the animal and kill it at the entrance of the Tent of the Lord 's presence. The Aaronite priests shall throw the blood against all four sides of the altar
Leviticus,3,3,"and present the following parts of the animal as a food offering to the Lord : all the fat on the internal organs,"
Leviticus,3,4,"the kidneys and the fat on them, and the best part of the liver."
Leviticus,3,5,The priests shall burn all this on the altar along with the burnt offerings. The odor of this food offering is pleasing to the Lord.
Leviticus,3,6,"If a sheep or goat is used as a fellowship offering, it may be male or female, but it must be without any defects."
Leviticus,3,7,"If you offer a sheep,"
Leviticus,3,8,you shall put your hand on its head and kill it in front of the Tent. The priests shall throw its blood against all four sides of the altar
Leviticus,3,9,"and present the following parts of the animal as a food offering to the Lord : the fat, the entire fat tail cut off near the backbone, all the fat covering the internal organs,"
Leviticus,3,10,"the kidneys and the fat on them, and the best part of the liver."
Leviticus,3,11,The officiating priest shall burn all this on the altar as a food offering to the Lord.
Leviticus,3,12,"If you offer a goat,"
Leviticus,3,13,you shall put your hand on its head and kill it in front of the Tent. The priests shall throw its blood against all four sides of the altar
Leviticus,3,14,"and present the following parts as a food offering to the Lord : all the fat on the internal organs,"
Leviticus,3,15,"the kidneys and the fat on them, and the best part of the liver."
Leviticus,3,16,The priest shall burn all this on the altar as a food offering pleasing to the Lord . All the fat belongs to the Lord.
Leviticus,3,17,No Israelite may eat any fat or any blood; this is a rule to be kept forever by all Israelites wherever they live.
Leviticus,4,1,The Lord commanded Moses
Leviticus,4,2,"to tell the people of Israel that anyone who sinned and broke any of the Lord 's commands without intending to, would have to observe the following rules."
Leviticus,4,3,"If it is the High Priest who sins and so brings guilt on the people, he shall present a young bull without any defects and sacrifice it to the Lord for his sin."
Leviticus,4,4,"He shall bring the bull to the entrance of the Tent, put his hand on its head, and kill it there in the Lord 's presence."
Leviticus,4,5,Then the High Priest shall take some of the bull's blood and carry it into the Tent.
Leviticus,4,6,He shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it in front of the sacred curtain seven times.
Leviticus,4,7,"Then he shall put some of the blood on the projections at the corners of the incense altar in the Tent. He shall pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar used for burning sacrifices, which is at the entrance of the Tent."
Leviticus,4,8,"From this bull he shall take all the fat, the fat on the internal organs,"
Leviticus,4,9,"the kidneys and the fat on them, and the best part of the liver."
Leviticus,4,10,"The priest shall take this fat and burn it on the altar used for the burnt offerings, just as he does with the fat from the animal killed for the fellowship offering."
Leviticus,4,11,"But he shall take its skin, all its flesh, its head, its legs, and its internal organs, including the intestines,"
Leviticus,4,12,"carry it all outside the camp to the ritually clean place where the ashes are poured out, and there he shall burn it on a wood fire."
Leviticus,4,13,"If it is the whole community of Israel that sins and becomes guilty of breaking one of the Lord 's commands without intending to,"
Leviticus,4,14,"then as soon as the sin becomes known, the community shall bring a young bull as a sin offering. They shall bring it to the Tent of the Lord 's presence;"
Leviticus,4,15,"the leaders of the community shall put their hands on its head, and it shall be killed there."
Leviticus,4,16,"The High Priest shall take some of the bull's blood into the Tent,"
Leviticus,4,17,"dip his finger in it, and sprinkle it in front of the curtain seven times."
Leviticus,4,18,"He shall put some of the blood on the projections at the corners of the incense altar inside the Tent and pour out the rest of it at the base of the altar used for burning sacrifices, which is at the entrance of the Tent."
Leviticus,4,19,Then he shall take all its fat and burn it on the altar.
Leviticus,4,20,"He shall do the same thing with this bull as he does with the bull for the sin offering, and in this way he shall make the sacrifice for the people's sin, and they will be forgiven."
Leviticus,4,21,"Then he shall take the bull outside the camp and burn it, just as he burns the bull offered for his own sin. This is an offering to take away the sin of the community."
Leviticus,4,22,"If it is a ruler who sins and becomes guilty of breaking one of the Lord 's commands without intending to,"
Leviticus,4,23,"then as soon as the sin is called to his attention, he shall bring as his offering a male goat without any defects."
Leviticus,4,24,"He shall put his hand on its head and kill it on the north side of the altar, where the animals for the burnt offerings are killed. This is an offering to take away sin."
Leviticus,4,25,"The priest shall dip his finger in the blood of the animal, put it on the projections at the corners of the altar, and pour out the rest of it at the base of the altar."
Leviticus,4,26,"Then he shall burn all of its fat on the altar, just as he burns the fat of the animals killed for the fellowship offerings. In this way the priest shall offer the sacrifice for the sin of the ruler, and he will be forgiven."
Leviticus,4,27," If any of you people sin and become guilty of breaking one of the Lord 's commands without intending to,"
Leviticus,4,28,"then as soon as the sin is called to your attention, you shall bring as your offering a female goat without any defects."
Leviticus,4,29,"You shall put your hand on its head and kill it on the north side of the altar, where the animals for the burnt offerings are killed."
Leviticus,4,30,"The priest shall dip his finger in the blood of the animal, put it on the projections at the corners of the altar, and pour out the rest of it at the base of the altar."
Leviticus,4,31,"Then he shall remove all its fat, just as the fat is removed from the animals killed for the fellowship offerings, and he shall burn it on the altar as an odor pleasing to the Lord . In this way the priest shall offer the sacrifice for the man's sin, and he will be forgiven."
Leviticus,4,32,"If you bring a sheep as a sin offering, it must be a female without any defects."
Leviticus,4,33,"You shall put your hand on its head and kill it on the north side of the altar, where the animals for the burnt offerings are killed."
Leviticus,4,34,"The priest shall dip his finger in the blood of the animal, put it on the projections at the corners of the altar, and pour out the rest of it at the base of the altar."
Leviticus,4,35,"Then he shall remove all its fat, just as the fat is removed from the sheep killed for the fellowship offerings, and he shall burn it on the altar along with the food offerings given to the Lord . In this way the priest shall offer the sacrifice for your sin, and you will be forgiven."
Leviticus,5,1,"Sin offerings are required in the following cases. If you are officially summoned to give evidence in court and do not give information about something you have seen or heard, you must suffer the consequences."
Leviticus,5,2,"If you unintentionally touch anything ritually unclean, such as a dead animal, you are unclean and guilty as soon as you realize what you have done."
Leviticus,5,3,"If you unintentionally touch anything of human origin that is unclean, whatever it may be, you are guilty as soon as you realize what you have done."
Leviticus,5,4,"If you make a careless vow, no matter what it is about, you are guilty as soon as you realize what you have done."
Leviticus,5,5,"When you are guilty, you must confess the sin,"
Leviticus,5,6,and as the penalty for your sin you must bring to the Lord a female sheep or goat as an offering. The priest shall offer the sacrifice for your sin.
Leviticus,5,7,"If you cannot afford a sheep or a goat, you shall bring to the Lord as the payment for your sin two doves or two pigeons, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering."
Leviticus,5,8,"You shall bring them to the priest, who will first offer the bird for the sin offering. He will break its neck without pulling off its head"
Leviticus,5,9,and sprinkle some of its blood against the side of the altar. The rest of the blood will be drained out at the base of the altar. This is an offering to take away sin.
Leviticus,5,10,"Then he shall offer the second bird as a burnt offering, according to the regulations. In this way the priest shall offer the sacrifice for your sin, and you will be forgiven."
Leviticus,5,11,"If you cannot afford two doves or two pigeons, you shall bring two pounds of flour as a sin offering. You shall not put any olive oil or any incense on it, because it is a sin offering, not a grain offering."
Leviticus,5,12,"You shall bring it to the priest, who will take a handful of it as a token that it has all been offered to the Lord , and he will burn it on the altar as a food offering. It is an offering to take away sin."
Leviticus,5,13,"In this way the priest shall offer the sacrifice for your sin, and you will be forgiven. The rest of the flour belongs to the priest, just as in the case of a grain offering."
Leviticus,5,14,The Lord gave the following regulations to Moses.
Leviticus,5,15,"If any of you sin unintentionally by failing to hand over the payments that are sacred to the Lord , you shall bring as your repayment offering to the Lord a male sheep or goat without any defects. Its value is to be determined according to the official standard."
Leviticus,5,16,"You must make the payments you have failed to hand over and must pay an additional 20 percent. You shall give it to the priest, and the priest shall offer the animal as a sacrifice for your sin, and you will be forgiven."
Leviticus,5,17,"If any of you sin unintentionally by breaking any of the Lord 's commands, you are guilty and must pay the penalty."
Leviticus,5,18,"You must bring to the priest as a repayment offering a male sheep or goat without any defects. Its value is to be determined according to the official standard. The priest shall offer the sacrifice for the sin which you committed unintentionally, and you will be forgiven."
Leviticus,5,19,It is a repayment offering for the sin you committed against the Lord.
Leviticus,6,1, The Lord gave the following regulations to Moses.
Leviticus,6,2,An offering is to be made if any of you sin against the Lord by refusing to return what another Israelite has left as a deposit or by stealing something from him or by cheating him
Leviticus,6,3,or by lying about something that has been lost and swearing that you did not find it.
Leviticus,7,1,"The following are the regulations for repayment offerings, which are very holy."
Leviticus,7,2,"The animal for this offering is to be killed on the north side of the altar, where the animals for the burnt offerings are killed, and its blood is to be thrown against all four sides of the altar."
Leviticus,7,3,"All of its fat shall be removed and offered on the altar: the fat tail, the fat covering the internal organs,"
Leviticus,7,4,"the kidneys and the fat on them, and the best part of the liver."
Leviticus,7,5,The priest shall burn all the fat on the altar as a food offering to the Lord . It is a repayment offering.
Leviticus,7,6,"Any male of the priestly families may eat it, but it must be eaten in a holy place, because it is very holy."
Leviticus,7,7,There is one regulation that applies to both the sin offering and the repayment offering: the meat belongs to the priest who offers the sacrifice.
Leviticus,7,8,The skin of an animal offered as a burnt offering belongs to the priest who offers the sacrifice.
Leviticus,7,9,Every grain offering that has been baked in an oven or prepared in a pan or on a griddle belongs to the priest who has offered it to God.
Leviticus,7,10,"But all uncooked grain offerings, whether mixed with oil or dry, belong to all the Aaronite priests and must be shared equally among them."
Leviticus,7,11,The following are the regulations for the fellowship offerings presented to the Lord.
Leviticus,7,12,"If you make this offering as a thanksgiving offering to God, you shall present, together with the animal to be sacrificed, an offering of bread made without yeast: either thick loaves made of flour mixed with olive oil or thin cakes brushed with olive oil or cakes made of flour mixed with olive oil."
Leviticus,7,13,"In addition, you shall offer loaves of bread baked with yeast."
Leviticus,7,14,You shall present one part of each kind of bread as a special contribution to the Lord ; it belongs to the priest who takes the blood of the animal and throws it against the altar.
Leviticus,7,15,The flesh of the animal must be eaten on the day it is sacrificed; none of it may be left until the next morning.
Leviticus,7,16,"If you bring a fellowship offering as fulfillment of a vow or as your own freewill offering, not all of it has to be eaten on the day it is offered, but any that is left over may be eaten on the following day."
Leviticus,7,17,Any meat that still remains on the third day must be burned.
Leviticus,7,18,"If any of it is eaten on the third day, God will not accept your offering. The offering will not be counted to your credit but will be considered unclean, and whoever eats it will suffer the consequences."
Leviticus,7,19,"If the meat comes into contact with anything ritually unclean, it must not be eaten, but must be burned. Any of you that are ritually clean may eat the meat,"
Leviticus,7,20,"but if any of you who are not clean eat it, you shall no longer be considered one of God's people."
Leviticus,7,21,"Also, if you eat the meat of this offering after you have touched anything ritually unclean, whether from a person or an animal, you shall no longer be considered one of God's people."
Leviticus,7,22,The Lord gave Moses the following regulations
Leviticus,7,23,"for the people of Israel. No fat of cattle, sheep, or goats shall be eaten."
Leviticus,7,24,"The fat of an animal that has died a natural death or has been killed by a wild animal must not be eaten, but it may be used for any other purpose."
Leviticus,7,25,Anyone who eats the fat of an animal that may be offered as a food offering to the Lord will no longer be considered one of God's people.
Leviticus,7,26,"No matter where the Israelites live, they must never use the blood of birds or animals for food."
Leviticus,7,27,Anyone who breaks this law will no longer be considered one of God's people.
Leviticus,7,28,The Lord gave Moses the following regulations
Leviticus,7,29,"for the people of Israel. When any of you offer a fellowship offering you must bring part of it as a special gift to the Lord,"
Leviticus,7,30,bringing it with your own hands as a food offering. You shall bring the fat of the animal with its breast and present it as a special gift to the Lord.
Leviticus,7,31,"The priest shall burn the fat on the altar, but the breast shall belong to the priests."
Leviticus,7,32,The right hind leg of the animal shall be given as a special contribution
Leviticus,7,33,to the priest who offers the blood and the fat of the fellowship offering.
Leviticus,7,34,"The breast of the animal is a special gift, and the right hind leg is a special contribution that the Lord has taken from the people of Israel and given to the priests. This is what the people of Israel must give to the priests for all time to come."
Leviticus,7,35,This is the part of the food offered to the Lord that was given to Aaron and his sons on the day they were ordained as priests.
Leviticus,7,36,On that day the Lord commanded the people of Israel to give them this part of the offering. It is a regulation that the people of Israel must obey for all time to come.
Leviticus,7,37,"These, then, are the regulations for the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, the sin offerings, the repayment offerings, the ordination offerings, and the fellowship offerings."
Leviticus,7,38,"There on Mount Sinai in the desert, the Lord gave these commands to Moses on the day he told the people of Israel to make their offerings."
Leviticus,8,1,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Leviticus,8,2,"“Take Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the Tent of my presence and bring the priestly garments, the anointing oil, the young bull for the sin offering, the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread."
Leviticus,8,3,Then call the whole community together there.”
Leviticus,8,4,"Moses did as the Lord had commanded, and when the community had assembled,"
Leviticus,8,5,"he said to them, “What I am now about to do is what the Lord has commanded.”"
Leviticus,8,6,Moses brought Aaron and his sons forward and had them take a ritual bath.
Leviticus,8,7,He put the shirt and the robe on Aaron and the sash around his waist. He put the ephod on him and fastened it by putting its finely woven belt around his waist.
Leviticus,8,8,He put the breastpiece on him and put the Urim and Thummim in it.
Leviticus,8,9,"He placed the turban on his head, and on the front of it he put the gold ornament, the sacred sign of dedication, just as the Lord had commanded him."
Leviticus,8,10,"Then Moses took the anointing oil and put it on the Tent of the Lord 's presence and everything that was in it, and in this way he dedicated it all to the Lord."
Leviticus,8,11,"He took some of the oil and sprinkled it seven times on the altar and its equipment and on the basin and its base, in order to dedicate them to the Lord."
Leviticus,8,12,He ordained Aaron by pouring some of the anointing oil on his head.
Leviticus,8,13,"Next, Moses brought the sons of Aaron forward and put shirts on them, put sashes around their waists, and tied caps on their heads, just as the Lord had commanded."
Leviticus,8,14,"Then Moses brought the young bull for the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons put their hands on its head."
Leviticus,8,15,"Moses killed it and took some of the blood, and with his finger put it on the projections at the corners of the altar, in order to dedicate it. He then poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar. In this way he dedicated it and purified it."
Leviticus,8,16,"Moses took all the fat on the internal organs, the best part of the liver, and the kidneys with the fat on them, and burned it all on the altar."
Leviticus,8,17,"He took the rest of the bull, including its skin, flesh, and intestines, and burned it outside the camp, just as the Lord had commanded."
Leviticus,8,18,"Next, Moses brought the ram for the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons put their hands on its head."
Leviticus,8,19,Moses killed it and threw the blood on all four sides of the altar.
Leviticus,9,1,"The day after the ordination rites were completed, Moses called Aaron and his sons and the leaders of Israel."
Leviticus,9,2,"He said to Aaron, “Take a young bull and a ram without any defects and offer them to the Lord , the bull for a sin offering and the ram for a burnt offering."
Leviticus,9,3,"Then tell the people of Israel to take a male goat for a sin offering, a one-year-old calf, and a one-year-old lamb without any defects for a burnt offering,"
Leviticus,9,4,and a bull and a ram for a fellowship offering. They are to sacrifice them to the Lord with the grain offering mixed with oil. They must do this because the Lord will appear to them today.”
Leviticus,9,5,"They brought to the front of the Tent everything that Moses had commanded, and the whole community assembled there to worship the Lord."
Leviticus,9,6,"Moses said, “The Lord has commanded you to do all this, so that the dazzling light of his presence can appear to you.”"
Leviticus,9,7,"Then he said to Aaron, “Go to the altar and offer the sin offering and the burnt offering to take away your sins and the sins of the people. Present this offering to take away the sins of the people, just as the Lord commanded.”"
Leviticus,9,8,Aaron went to the altar and killed the young bull which was for his own sin offering.
Leviticus,9,9,"His sons brought him the blood, and he dipped his finger in it, put some of it on the projections at the corners of the altar, and poured out the rest of it at the base of the altar."
Leviticus,9,10,"Then he burned on the altar the fat, the kidneys, and the best part of the liver, just as the Lord had commanded Moses."
Leviticus,9,11,But he burned the meat and the skin outside the camp.
Leviticus,9,12,"He killed the animal which was for his own burnt offering. His sons brought him the blood, and he threw it on all four sides of the altar."
Leviticus,9,13,"They handed him the head and the other pieces of the animal, and he burned them on the altar."
Leviticus,9,14,Then he washed the internal organs and the hind legs and burned them on the altar on top of the rest of the burnt offering.
Leviticus,9,15,"After that, he presented the people's offerings. He took the goat that was to be offered for the people's sins, killed it, and offered it, as he had done with his own sin offering."
Leviticus,9,16,He also brought the animal for the burnt offering and offered it according to the regulations.
Leviticus,9,17,He presented the grain offering and took a handful of flour and burned it on the altar. (This was in addition to the daily burnt offering.)
Leviticus,9,18,"He killed the bull and the ram as a fellowship offering for the people. His sons brought him the blood, and he threw it on all four sides of the altar."
Leviticus,9,19,Aaron put the fat parts of the bull and the ram
Leviticus,9,20,on top of the breasts of the animals and carried it all to the altar. He burned the fat on the altar
Leviticus,9,21,"and presented the breasts and the right hind legs as the special gift to the Lord for the priests, as Moses had commanded."
Leviticus,9,22," When Aaron had finished all the sacrifices, he raised his hands over the people and blessed them, and then stepped down."
Leviticus,9,23,"Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of the Lord 's presence, and when they came out, they blessed the people, and the dazzling light of the Lord 's presence appeared to all the people."
Leviticus,9,24,"Suddenly the Lord sent a fire, and it consumed the burnt offering and the fat parts on the altar. When the people saw it, they all shouted and bowed down with their faces to the ground."
Leviticus,10,1,"Aaron's sons, Nadab and Abihu, each took his fire pan, put live coals in it, added incense, and presented it to the Lord . But this fire was not holy, because the Lord had not commanded them to present it."
Leviticus,10,2,"Suddenly the Lord sent fire, and it burned them to death there in the presence of the Lord."
Leviticus,10,3,"Then Moses said to Aaron, “This is what the Lord was speaking about when he said, ‘All who serve me must respect my holiness; I will reveal my glory to my people.’” But Aaron remained silent."
Leviticus,10,4,"Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel, Aaron's uncle, and said to them, “Come here and carry your cousins' bodies away from the sacred Tent and put them outside the camp.”"
Leviticus,10,5,"So they came and took hold of the clothing on the corpses and carried them outside the camp, just as Moses had commanded."
Leviticus,10,6,"Then Moses said to Aaron and to his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, “Do not leave your hair uncombed or tear your clothes to show that you are in mourning. If you do, you will die, and the Lord will be angry with the whole community. But all other Israelites are allowed to mourn this death caused by the fire which the Lord sent."
Leviticus,10,7,"Do not leave the entrance of the Tent or you will die, because you have been consecrated by the anointing oil of the Lord .” So they did as Moses said."
Leviticus,10,8,"The Lord said to Aaron,"
Leviticus,10,9,"“You and your sons are not to enter the Tent of my presence after drinking wine or beer; if you do, you will die. This is a law to be kept by all your descendants."
Leviticus,10,10,"You must distinguish between what belongs to God and what is for general use, between what is ritually clean and what is unclean."
Leviticus,10,11,You must teach the people of Israel all the laws which I have given to you through Moses.”
Leviticus,10,12," Moses said to Aaron and his two remaining sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, “Take the grain offering that is left over from the food offered to the Lord , make unleavened bread with it and eat it beside the altar, because this offering is very holy."
Leviticus,10,13,Eat it in a holy place; it is the part that belongs to you and your sons from the food offered to the Lord . That is what the Lord commanded me.
Leviticus,10,14,But you and your families may eat the breast and the hind leg that are presented as the special gift and the special contribution to the Lord for the priests. You may eat them in any ritually clean place. These offerings have been given to you and your children as the part that belongs to you from the fellowship offerings of the people of Israel.
Leviticus,10,15,"They shall bring the hind leg and the breast at the time the fat is presented as a food offering to the Lord . These parts belong to you and your children forever, just as the Lord commanded.”"
Leviticus,10,16,"Moses asked about the goat for the sin offering and learned that it had already been burned. This made him angry at Eleazar and Ithamar, and he demanded,"
Leviticus,10,17,"“Why didn't you eat the sin offering in a sacred place? It is very holy, and the Lord has given it to you in order to take away the sin of the community."
Leviticus,10,18,"Since its blood was not brought into the sacred Tent, you should have eaten the sacrifice there, as I commanded.”"
Leviticus,10,19,"Aaron answered, “If I had eaten the sin offering today, would the Lord have approved? The people presented their sin offering to the Lord today, and they brought their burnt offering, but still these terrible things have happened to me.”"
Leviticus,10,20,"When Moses heard this, he was satisfied."
Leviticus,11,1,The Lord gave Moses and Aaron the following regulations
Leviticus,11,2,for the people of Israel. You may eat any land animal
Leviticus,11,3,"that has divided hoofs and that also chews the cud,"
Leviticus,12,1,The Lord gave Moses the following regulations
Leviticus,12,2,"for the people of Israel. For seven days after a woman gives birth to a son, she is ritually unclean, as she is during her monthly period."
Leviticus,12,3,"On the eighth day, the child shall be circumcised."
Leviticus,12,4,Then it will be thirty-three more days until she is ritually clean from her loss of blood; she must not touch anything that is holy or enter the sacred Tent until the time of her purification is completed.
Leviticus,12,5,"For fourteen days after a woman gives birth to a daughter, she is ritually unclean, as she is during her monthly period. Then it will be sixty-six more days until she is ritually clean from her loss of blood."
Leviticus,12,6,"When the time of her purification is completed, whether for a son or daughter, she shall bring to the priest at the entrance of the Tent of the Lord 's presence a one-year-old lamb for a burnt offering and a pigeon or a dove for a sin offering."
Leviticus,12,7,"The priest shall present her offering to the Lord and perform the ritual to take away her impurity, and she will be ritually clean. This, then, is what a woman must do after giving birth."
Leviticus,12,8," If the woman cannot afford a lamb, she shall bring two doves or two pigeons, one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering, and the priest shall perform the ritual to take away her impurity, and she will be ritually clean."
Leviticus,13,1,The Lord gave Moses and Aaron these regulations.
Leviticus,13,2,"If any of you have a sore on your skin or a boil or an inflammation which could develop into a dreaded skin disease, you shall be brought to the Aaronite priest."
Leviticus,13,3,"The priest shall examine the sore, and if the hairs in it have turned white and the sore appears to be deeper than the surrounding skin, it is a dreaded skin disease, and the priest shall pronounce you unclean."
Leviticus,13,4,"But if the sore is white and does not appear to be deeper than the skin around it and the hairs have not turned white, the priest shall isolate you for seven days."
Leviticus,13,5,"The priest shall examine you again on the seventh day, and if in his opinion the sore looks the same and has not spread, he shall isolate you for another seven days."
Leviticus,13,6,"The priest shall examine you again on the seventh day, and if the sore has faded and has not spread, he shall pronounce you ritually clean; it is only a sore. You shall wash your clothes and be ritually clean."
Leviticus,13,7,"But if the sore spreads after the priest has examined you and pronounced you clean, you must appear before the priest again."
Leviticus,13,8,"The priest will examine you again, and if it has spread, he shall pronounce you unclean; it is a dreaded skin disease."
Leviticus,13,9,"If any of you have a dreaded skin disease, you shall be brought to the priest,"
Leviticus,13,10,"who will examine you. If there is a white sore on your skin which turns the hairs white and is full of pus,"
Leviticus,13,11,"it is a chronic skin disease. The priest shall pronounce you unclean; there is no need to isolate you, because you are obviously unclean."
Leviticus,13,12,"If the skin disease spreads and covers you from head to foot,"
Leviticus,13,13,"the priest shall examine you again. If he finds that it actually has covered the whole body, he shall pronounce you ritually clean. If your whole skin has turned white, you are ritually clean."
Leviticus,13,14,"But from the moment an open sore appears, you are unclean."
Leviticus,13,15,"The priest shall examine you again, and if he sees an open sore, he shall pronounce you unclean. An open sore means a dreaded skin disease, and you are unclean."
Leviticus,13,16,"But when the sore heals and becomes white again, you shall go to the priest,"
Leviticus,13,17,"who will examine you again. If the sore has turned white, you are ritually clean, and the priest shall pronounce you clean."
Leviticus,13,18,If any of you have a boil that has healed
Leviticus,13,19,"and if afterward a white swelling or a reddish-white spot appears where the boil was, you shall go to the priest."
Leviticus,13,20,"The priest shall examine you, and if the spot seems to be deeper than the surrounding skin and the hairs in it have turned white, he shall pronounce you unclean. It is a dreaded skin disease that has started in the boil."
Leviticus,13,21,"But if the priest examines it and finds that the hairs in it have not turned white and that it is not deeper than the surrounding skin, but is light in color, the priest shall isolate you for seven days."
Leviticus,13,22,"If the spot spreads, the priest shall pronounce you unclean; you are diseased."
Leviticus,13,23,"But if it remains unchanged and does not spread, it is only the scar left from the boil, and the priest shall pronounce you ritually clean."
Leviticus,13,24,"In case any of you have been burned, if the raw flesh becomes white or reddish-white,"
Leviticus,13,25,"the priest shall examine you. If the hairs in the spot have turned white and it appears deeper than the surrounding skin, it is a dreaded skin disease that has started in the burn, and the priest shall pronounce you unclean."
Leviticus,13,26,"But if the hairs in it have not turned white and it is not deeper than the surrounding skin, but is light in color, the priest shall isolate you for seven days."
Leviticus,13,27,"The priest shall examine you again on the seventh day, and if it is spreading, it is a dreaded skin disease, and the priest shall pronounce you unclean."
Leviticus,13,28,"But if the spot remains unchanged and does not spread and is light in color, it is not a dreaded skin disease. The priest shall pronounce you ritually clean, because it is only a scar from the burn."
Leviticus,13,29,"When any of you, male or female, have a sore on your head or chin,"
Leviticus,13,30,"the priest shall examine it. If it seems to be deeper than the surrounding skin and the hairs in it are yellowish and thin, it is a dreaded skin disease, and he shall pronounce you unclean."
Leviticus,13,31,"If, when the priest examines you, the sore does not appear to be deeper than the surrounding skin, but there are still no healthy hairs in it, he shall isolate you for seven days."
Leviticus,13,32,"The priest shall examine the sore again on the seventh day, and if it has not spread and there are no yellowish hairs in it and it does not seem to be deeper than the surrounding skin,"
Leviticus,13,33,you shall shave the head except the area around the sore. The priest shall then isolate you for another seven days.
Leviticus,13,34,"On the seventh day the priest shall again examine the sore, and if it has not spread and does not seem to be deeper than the surrounding skin, he shall pronounce you ritually clean. You shall wash your clothes, and you will be clean."
Leviticus,13,35,"But if the sore spreads after you have been pronounced clean,"
Leviticus,13,36,"the priest shall examine you again. If the sore has spread, he need not look for yellowish hairs; you are obviously unclean."
Leviticus,13,37,"But if in the priest's opinion the sore has not spread and healthy hairs are growing in it, the sore has healed, and the priest shall pronounce you ritually clean."
Leviticus,13,38,"When any of you, male or female, have white spots on the skin,"
Leviticus,13,39,"the priest shall examine you. If the spots are dull white, it is only a blemish that has broken out on the skin; you are ritually clean."
Leviticus,14,1,The Lord gave Moses
Leviticus,14,2,"the following regulations about the ritual purification of those of you cured of a dreaded skin disease. On the day you are to be pronounced clean, you shall be brought to the priest,"
Leviticus,14,3,"and the priest shall take you outside the camp and examine you. If the disease is healed,"
Leviticus,14,4,"the priest shall order that two ritually clean birds be brought, along with a piece of cedar wood, a red cord, and a sprig of hyssop."
Leviticus,14,5,Then the priest shall order that one of the birds be killed over a clay bowl containing fresh spring water.
Leviticus,14,6,"He shall take the other bird and dip it, together with the cedar wood, the red cord, and the hyssop, in the blood of the bird that was killed."
Leviticus,14,7,"He shall sprinkle the blood seven times on the one of you who is to be purified from your skin disease, and then he shall pronounce you clean. He shall let the live bird fly away over the open fields."
Leviticus,14,8,"You shall wash your clothes, shave off all your hair, and take a bath; you will then be ritually clean. You may enter the camp, but you must live outside your tent for seven days."
Leviticus,14,9,"On the seventh day you shall again shave your head, your beard, your eyebrows, and all the rest of the hair on your body; you shall wash your clothes and take a bath, and then you will be ritually clean."
Leviticus,14,10,"On the eighth day you shall bring two male lambs and one female lamb a year old that are without any defects, five pounds of flour mixed with olive oil, and half a pint of olive oil."
Leviticus,14,11,The priest shall take you and these offerings to the entrance of the Tent of the Lord 's presence.
Leviticus,14,12,Then the priest shall take one of the male lambs and together with the half pint of oil he shall offer it as a repayment offering. He shall present them as a special gift to the Lord for the priest.
Leviticus,14,13,"He shall kill the lamb in the holy place where the animals for the sin offerings and the burnt offerings are killed. He must do this because the repayment offering, like the sin offering, belongs to the priest and is very holy."
Leviticus,14,14,"The priest shall take some of the blood of the lamb and put it on the lobe of the right ear, on the thumb of the right hand, and on the big toe of the right foot of the one of you to be declared ritually clean."
Leviticus,14,15,"The priest shall take some of the olive oil and pour it in the palm of his own left hand,"
Leviticus,14,16,"dip a finger of his right hand in it, and sprinkle some of it seven times there in the Lord 's presence."
Leviticus,14,17,"He shall take some of the oil that is in the palm of his hand and some of the blood of the lamb and put them on the lobe of the right ear, on the thumb of the right hand, and on the big toe of the right foot of the one of you to be declared ritually clean."
Leviticus,14,18,He shall put the rest of the oil that is in the palm of his hand on your head. In this way he shall perform the ritual of purification.
Leviticus,14,19,"Then the priest shall offer the sin offering and perform the ritual of purification. After that, he shall kill the animal for the burnt offering"
Leviticus,14,20,"and offer it with the grain offering on the altar. In this way the priest shall perform the ritual of purification, and you will be ritually clean."
Leviticus,14,21,"If you are poor and cannot afford any more, you shall bring for your purification only one male lamb as your repayment offering, a special gift to the Lord for the priest. You shall bring only two pounds of flour mixed with olive oil for a grain offering and half a pint of olive oil."
Leviticus,14,22,"You shall also bring two doves or two pigeons, one for the sin offering and one for the burnt offering."
Leviticus,14,23,On the eighth day of your purification you shall bring them to the priest at the entrance of the Tent.
Leviticus,14,24,The priest shall take the lamb and the olive oil and present them as a special gift to the Lord for the priest.
Leviticus,14,25,"He shall kill the lamb and take some of the blood and put it on the lobe of your right ear, on the thumb of your right hand, and on the big toe of your right foot."
Leviticus,14,26,The priest shall pour some of the oil into the palm of his own left hand
Leviticus,14,27,and with a finger of his right hand sprinkle some of it seven times there in the Lord 's presence.
Leviticus,14,28,"He shall put some of the oil on the same places he put the blood: on the lobe of your right ear, on the thumb of your right hand, and on the big toe of your right foot."
Leviticus,14,29,The rest of the oil that is in his palm he shall put on your head and in this way perform the ritual of purification.
Leviticus,14,30,Then he shall offer one of the doves or pigeons
Leviticus,14,31,as the sin offering and the other as the burnt offering with the grain offering. In this way the priest shall perform the ritual of purification.
Leviticus,14,32,This is the law for those who have a dreaded skin disease but who cannot afford the normal offerings required for his purification.
Leviticus,14,33,The Lord gave Moses and Aaron
Leviticus,15,1,The Lord gave Moses and Aaron the following regulations

Leviticus,15,12,"Any clay pot that the man touches must be broken, and any wooden bowl that he touches must be washed."
Leviticus,15,13,"After the man is cured of his discharge, he must wait seven days and then wash his clothes and take a bath in fresh spring water, and he will be ritually clean."
Leviticus,15,14,On the eighth day he shall take two doves or two pigeons to the entrance of the Tent of the Lord 's presence and give them to the priest.
Leviticus,15,15,The priest shall offer one of them as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering. In this way he will perform the ritual of purification for the man.
Leviticus,15,16,"When a man has an emission of semen, he must bathe his whole body, and he remains unclean until evening."

Leviticus,16,1,The Lord spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron who were killed when they offered unholy fire to the Lord.
Leviticus,16,2,"He said, “Tell your brother Aaron that only at the proper time is he to go behind the curtain into the Most Holy Place, because that is where I appear in a cloud above the lid on the Covenant Box. If he disobeys, he will be killed."
Leviticus,16,3,He may enter the Most Holy Place only after he has brought a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering.”
Leviticus,16,4,"Then the Lord gave the following instructions. Before Aaron goes into the Most Holy Place, he must take a bath and put on the priestly garments: the linen robe and shorts, the belt, and the turban."
Leviticus,16,5,The community of Israel shall give Aaron two male goats for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering.
Leviticus,16,6,He shall offer a bull as a sacrifice to take away his own sins and those of his family.
Leviticus,16,7,Then he shall take the two goats to the entrance of the Tent of the Lord 's presence.
Leviticus,16,8,"There he shall draw lots, using two stones, one marked “for the Lord ” and the other “for Azazel.”"
Leviticus,16,9,Aaron shall sacrifice the goat chosen by lot for the Lord and offer it as a sin offering.
Leviticus,16,10,"The goat chosen for Azazel shall be presented alive to the Lord and sent off into the desert to Azazel, in order to take away the sins of the people."
Leviticus,16,11,"When Aaron sacrifices the bull as the sin offering for himself and his family,"
Leviticus,16,12,he shall take a fire pan full of burning coals from the altar and two handfuls of fine incense and bring them into the Most Holy Place.
Leviticus,16,13,"There in the Lord 's presence he shall put the incense on the fire, and the smoke of the incense will hide the lid of the Covenant Box so that he will not see it and die."
Leviticus,16,14,He shall take some of the bull's blood and with his finger sprinkle it on the front of the lid and then sprinkle some of it seven times in front of the Covenant Box.
Leviticus,16,15," After that, he shall kill the goat for the sin offering for the people, bring its blood into the Most Holy Place, and sprinkle it on the lid and then in front of the Covenant Box, as he did with the bull's blood."
Leviticus,16,16,"In this way he will perform the ritual to purify the Most Holy Place from the uncleanness of the people of Israel and from all their sins. He must do this to the Tent, because it stands in the middle of the camp, which is ritually unclean."
Leviticus,16,17,"From the time Aaron enters the Most Holy Place to perform the ritual of purification until he comes out, there must be no one in the Tent. When he has performed the ritual for himself, his family, and the whole community,"
Leviticus,16,18,he must then go out to the altar for burnt offerings and purify it. He must take some of the bull's blood and some of the goat's blood and put it all over the projections at the corners of the altar.
Leviticus,16,19,With his finger he must sprinkle some of the blood on the altar seven times. In this way he is to purify it from the sins of the people of Israel and make it holy.
Leviticus,16,20,"When Aaron has finished performing the ritual to purify the Most Holy Place, the rest of the Tent of the Lord 's presence, and the altar, he shall present to the Lord the live goat chosen for Azazel."
Leviticus,16,21,"He shall put both of his hands on the goat's head and confess over it all the evils, sins, and rebellions of the people of Israel, and so transfer them to the goat's head. Then the goat is to be driven off into the desert by someone appointed to do it."
Leviticus,16,22,The goat will carry all their sins away with him into some uninhabited land.
Leviticus,16,23," Then Aaron shall go into the Tent, take off the priestly garments that he had put on before entering the Most Holy Place, and leave them there."
Leviticus,16,24,"He must take a bath in a holy place and put on his own clothes. After that, he shall go out and offer the burnt offering to remove his own sins and those of the people."
Leviticus,16,25,He shall burn on the altar the fat of the animal for the sin offering.
Leviticus,16,26,The man who drove the goat into the desert to Azazel must wash his clothes and take a bath before he comes back into camp.
Leviticus,16,27,"The bull and the goat used for the sin offering, whose blood was brought into the Most Holy Place to take away sin, shall be carried outside the camp and burned. Skin, meat, and intestines shall all be burned."
Leviticus,16,28,The one who burns them must wash his clothes and take a bath before he returns to camp.
Leviticus,16,29, The following regulations are to be observed for all time to come. On the tenth day of the seventh month the Israelites and the foreigners living among them must fast and must not do any work.

Leviticus,16,34,These regulations are to be observed for all time to come. This ritual must be performed once a year to purify the people of Israel from all their sins. So Moses did as the Lord had commanded.

Leviticus,20,24,"But I have promised you this rich and fertile land as your possession, and I will give it to you. I am the Lord your God, and I have set you apart from the other nations."
Leviticus,20,25,"So then, you must make a clear distinction between animals and birds that are ritually clean and those that are not. Do not eat unclean animals or birds. I have declared them unclean, and eating them would make you unclean."
Leviticus,20,26,"You shall be holy and belong only to me, because I am the Lord and I am holy. I have set you apart from the other nations so that you would belong to me alone."
Leviticus,20,27,“Any man or woman who consults the spirits of the dead shall be stoned to death; any of you that do this are responsible for your own death.”
Leviticus,21,1,"The Lord commanded Moses to tell the Aaronite priests, “No priest is to make himself ritually unclean by taking part in the funeral ceremonies when a relative dies,"
Leviticus,21,2,"unless it is his mother, father, son, daughter, brother,"
Leviticus,21,3,or unmarried sister living in his house.
Leviticus,21,4,He shall not make himself unclean at the death of those related to him by marriage.
Leviticus,21,5, “No priest shall shave any part of his head or trim his beard or cut gashes on his body to show that he is in mourning.
Leviticus,21,6,"He must be holy and must not disgrace my name. He offers food offerings to me, and he must be holy."
Leviticus,21,7,A priest shall not marry a woman who has been a prostitute or a woman who is not a virgin or who is divorced; he is holy.
Leviticus,21,8,"The people must consider the priest holy, because he presents the food offerings to me. I am the Lord ; I am holy and I make my people holy."
Leviticus,21,9,"If a priest's daughter becomes a prostitute, she disgraces her father; she shall be burned to death."
Leviticus,21,10,"“The High Priest has had the anointing oil poured on his head and has been consecrated to wear the priestly garments, so he must not leave his hair uncombed or tear his clothes to show that he is in mourning."
Leviticus,22,1,The Lord commanded Moses
Leviticus,22,2,"to tell Aaron and his sons, “You must not bring disgrace on my holy name, so treat with respect the sacred offerings that the people of Israel dedicate to me. I am the Lord."
Leviticus,22,3,"If any of your descendants, while he is ritually unclean, comes near the sacred offerings which the people of Israel have dedicated to me, he can never again serve at the altar. This applies for all time to come. I am the Lord."
Leviticus,22,4,“None of the descendants of Aaron who has a dreaded skin disease or a discharge may eat any of the sacred offerings until he is ritually clean. Any priest is unclean if he touches anything which is unclean through contact with a corpse or if he has an emission of semen
Leviticus,22,5,or if he has touched an unclean animal or person.
Leviticus,22,6,"Any priest who becomes unclean remains unclean until evening, and even then he may not eat any of the sacred offerings until he has taken a bath."
Leviticus,22,7,"After the sun sets he is clean, and then he may eat the sacred offerings, which are his food."
Leviticus,22,8,He shall not eat the meat of any animal that has died a natural death or has been killed by wild animals; it will make him unclean. I am the Lord.
Leviticus,22,9,"“All priests shall observe the regulations that I have given. Otherwise, they will become guilty and die, because they have disobeyed the sacred regulations. I am the Lord and I make them holy."
Leviticus,22,10,“Only a member of a priestly family may eat any of the sacred offerings; no one else may eat them—not even someone staying with a priest or hired by him.
Leviticus,22,11,"But a priest's slaves, bought with his own money or born in his home, may eat the food the priest receives."
Leviticus,22,12,A priest's daughter who marries someone who is not a priest may not eat any of the sacred offerings.
Leviticus,22,13,But a widowed or divorced daughter who has no children and who has returned to live in her father's house as a dependent may eat the food her father receives as a priest. Only a member of a priestly family may eat any of it.
Leviticus,22,14,"“If any people who are not members of a priestly family eat any of the sacred offerings without intending to, they must repay the priest its full value plus an additional 20 percent."
Leviticus,22,15,The priests shall not profane the sacred offerings
Leviticus,22,16,by letting any unauthorized people eat them; this would bring guilt and punishment on such people. I am the Lord and I make the offerings holy.”
Leviticus,22,17,The Lord commanded Moses
Leviticus,22,18,"to give Aaron and his sons and all the people of Israel the following regulations. When any Israelite or any foreigner living in Israel presents a burnt offering, whether as fulfillment of a vow or as a freewill offering, the animal must not have any defects."
Leviticus,22,19,"To be accepted, it must be a male without any defects."
Leviticus,22,20,"If you offer any animal that has any defects, the Lord will not accept it."
Leviticus,22,21,"When anyone presents a fellowship offering to the Lord , whether as fulfillment of a vow or as a freewill offering, the animal must be without any defects if it is to be accepted."
Leviticus,22,22,"Do not offer to the Lord any animal that is blind or crippled or mutilated, or that has a running sore or a skin eruption or scabs. Do not offer any such animals on the altar as a food offering."
Leviticus,22,23,"As a freewill offering you may offer an animal that is stunted or not perfectly formed, but it is not acceptable in fulfillment of a vow."
Leviticus,22,24,"Do not offer to the Lord any animal whose testicles have been crushed, cut, bruised, or torn off. This is not permitted in your land."
Leviticus,22,25,Do not offer as a food offering any animal obtained from a foreigner. Such animals are considered defective and are not acceptable.
Leviticus,23,1,The Lord gave Moses
Leviticus,23,2,"the following regulations for the religious festivals, when the people of Israel are to gather for worship."
Leviticus,23,3,"You have six days in which to do your work, but remember that the seventh day, the Sabbath, is a day of rest. On that day do not work, but gather for worship. The Sabbath belongs to the Lord , no matter where you live."
Leviticus,23,4,Proclaim the following festivals at the appointed times.
Leviticus,23,5," The Passover, celebrated to honor the Lord , begins at sunset on the fourteenth day of the first month."
Leviticus,23,6,"On the fifteenth day the Festival of Unleavened Bread begins, and for seven days you must not eat any bread made with yeast."
Leviticus,23,7,On the first of these days you shall gather for worship and do none of your daily work.
Leviticus,23,8,"Offer your food offerings to the Lord for seven days. On the seventh day you shall again gather for worship, but you shall do none of your daily work."
Leviticus,24,1,The Lord told Moses
Leviticus,24,2,"to give the following orders to the people of Israel: Bring pure olive oil of the finest quality for the lamps in the Tent, so that a light might be kept burning regularly."
Leviticus,24,3,"Each evening Aaron shall light them and keep them burning until morning, there in the Lord 's presence outside the curtain in front of the Covenant Box, which is in the Most Holy Place. This regulation is to be observed for all time to come."
Leviticus,24,4,Aaron shall take care of the lamps on the lampstand of pure gold and must see that they burn regularly in the Lord 's presence.
Leviticus,24,5, Take twenty-four pounds of flour and bake twelve loaves of bread.
Leviticus,24,6,"Put the loaves in two rows, six in each row, on the table covered with pure gold, which is in the Lord 's presence."
Leviticus,24,7,"Put some pure incense on each row, as a token food offering to the Lord to take the place of the bread."
Leviticus,24,8,"Every Sabbath, for all time to come, the bread must be placed in the presence of the Lord . This is Israel's duty forever."
Leviticus,24,9,"The bread belongs to Aaron and his descendants, and they shall eat it in a holy place, because this is a very holy part of the food offered to the Lord for the priests."
Leviticus,25,1, The Lord spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai and commanded him
Leviticus,25,2,"to give the following regulations to the people of Israel. When you enter the land that the Lord is giving you, you shall honor the Lord by not cultivating the land every seventh year."
Leviticus,25,3,"You shall plant your fields, prune your vineyards, and gather your crops for six years."
Leviticus,25,4,"But the seventh year is to be a year of complete rest for the land, a year dedicated to the Lord . Do not plant your fields or prune your vineyards."
Leviticus,25,5,"Do not even harvest the grain that grows by itself without being planted, and do not gather the grapes from your unpruned vines; it is a year of complete rest for the land."
Leviticus,25,6,"Although the land has not been cultivated during that year, it will provide food for you, your slaves, your hired men, the foreigners living with you,"
Leviticus,25,7,"your domestic animals, and the wild animals in your fields. Everything that it produces may be eaten."
Leviticus,25,8,"Count seven times seven years, a total of forty-nine years."
Leviticus,25,9,"Then, on the tenth day of the seventh month, the Day of Atonement, send someone to blow a trumpet throughout the whole land."
Leviticus,25,10,"In this way you shall set the fiftieth year apart and proclaim freedom to all the inhabitants of the land. During this year all property that has been sold shall be restored to the original owner or the descendants, and any who have been sold as slaves shall return to their families."
Leviticus,25,11,You shall not plant your fields or harvest the grain that grows by itself or gather the grapes in your unpruned vineyards.
Leviticus,25,12,The whole year shall be sacred for you; you shall eat only what the fields produce of themselves.
Leviticus,25,13,In this year all property that has been sold shall be restored to its original owner.
Leviticus,25,14,"So when you sell land to an Israelite or buy land, do not deal unfairly."
Leviticus,25,15,The price is to be set according to the number of years the land can produce crops before the next Year of Restoration.
Leviticus,25,16,"If there are many years, the price shall be higher, but if there are only a few years, the price shall be lower, because what is being sold is the number of crops the land can produce."
Leviticus,25,17,"Do not cheat an Israelite, but obey the Lord your God."
Leviticus,25,18,"Obey all the Lord 's laws and commands, so that you may live in safety in the land."
Leviticus,25,19,"The land will produce its crops, and you will have all you want to eat and will live in safety."
Leviticus,25,20,"But someone may ask what there will be to eat during the seventh year, when no fields are planted and no crops gathered."
Leviticus,25,21,The Lord will bless the land in the sixth year so that it will produce enough food for two years.
Leviticus,25,22,"When you plant your fields in the eighth year, you will still be eating what you harvested during the sixth year, and you will have enough to eat until the crops you plant that year are harvested."
Leviticus,25,23,"Your land must not be sold on a permanent basis, because you do not own it; it belongs to God, and you are like foreigners who are allowed to make use of it."
Leviticus,25,24,"When land is sold, the right of the original owner to buy it back must be recognized."
Leviticus,25,25,"If any of you Israelites become poor and are forced to sell your land, your closest relative is to buy it back."
Leviticus,25,26,"If you have no relative to buy it back, you may later become prosperous and have enough to buy it back yourself."
Leviticus,25,27,"In that case you must pay to the one who bought it a sum that will make up for the years remaining until the next Year of Restoration, when you would in any event recover your land."
Leviticus,25,28,"But if you do not have enough money to buy the land back, it remains under the control of the one who bought it until the next Year of Restoration. In that year it will be returned to its original owner."
Leviticus,25,29,"If you sell a house in a walled city, you have the right to buy it back during the first full year from the date of sale."
Leviticus,25,30,"But if you do not buy it back within the year, you lose the right of repurchase, and the house becomes the permanent property of the purchasers and their descendants; it will not be returned in the Year of Restoration."
Leviticus,25,31,"But houses in unwalled villages are to be treated like fields; the original owner has the right to buy them back, and they are to be returned in the Year of Restoration."
Leviticus,25,32,"However, Levites have the right to buy back at any time their property in the cities assigned to them."
Leviticus,25,33,"If a house in one of these cities is sold by a Levite and is not bought back, it must be returned in the Year of Restoration, because the houses which the Levites own in their cities are their permanent property among the people of Israel."
Leviticus,25,34,But the pasture land around the Levite cities shall never be sold; it is their property forever.
Leviticus,25,35," If any Israelites living near you become poor and cannot support themselves, you must provide for them as you would for a hired worker, so that they can continue to live near you."
Leviticus,25,36,"Do not charge Israelites any interest, but obey God and let them live near you."
Leviticus,25,37,"Do not make them pay interest on the money you lend them, and do not make a profit on the food you sell them."
Leviticus,25,38,"This is the command of the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt in order to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God."
Leviticus,25,39," If any Israelites living near you become so poor that they sell themselves to you as a slave, you shall not make them do the work of a slave."
Leviticus,25,40,They shall stay with you as hired workers and serve you until the next Year of Restoration.
Leviticus,25,41,At that time they and their children shall leave you and return to their family and to the property of their ancestors.
Leviticus,25,42,"The people of Israel are the Lord 's slaves, and he brought them out of Egypt; they must not be sold into slavery."
Leviticus,25,43,"Do not treat them harshly, but obey your God."
Leviticus,25,44,"If you need slaves, you may buy them from the nations around you."
Leviticus,25,45,"You may also buy the children of the foreigners who are living among you. Such children born in your land may become your property,"
Leviticus,25,46,"and you may leave them as an inheritance to your children, whom they must serve as long as they live. But you must not treat any Israelites harshly."
Leviticus,25,47,"Suppose a foreigner living with you becomes rich, while some Israelites become poor and sell themselves as slaves to that foreigner or to a member of that foreigner's family."
Leviticus,25,48,"After they are sold, they still have the right to be bought back. A brother"
Leviticus,25,49,"or an uncle or a cousin or another close relative may buy them back; or if they themselves earn enough, they may buy their own freedom."
Leviticus,25,50,"They must consult the one who bought them, and they must count the years from the time they sold themselves until the next Year of Restoration and must set the price for their release on the basis of the wages paid hired workers."
Leviticus,26,1," The Lord said, “Do not make idols or set up statues, stone pillars, or carved stones to worship. I am the Lord your God."
Leviticus,26,2,Keep the religious festivals and honor the place where I am worshiped. I am the Lord.
Leviticus,26,3," “If you live according to my laws and obey my commands,"
Leviticus,26,4,"I will send you rain at the right time, so that the land will produce crops and the trees will bear fruit."
Leviticus,26,5,"Your crops will be so plentiful that you will still be harvesting grain when it is time to pick grapes, and you will still be picking grapes when it is time to plant grain. You will have all that you want to eat, and you can live in safety in your land."
Leviticus,26,6,"“I will give you peace in your land, and you can sleep without being afraid of anyone. I will get rid of the dangerous animals in the land, and there will be no more war there."
Leviticus,26,7,You will be victorious over your enemies;
Leviticus,26,8,"five of you will be able to defeat a hundred, and a hundred will be able to defeat ten thousand."
Leviticus,26,9,I will bless you and give you many children; I will keep my part of the covenant that I made with you.
Leviticus,26,10,"Your harvests will be so plentiful that they will last for a year, and even then you will have to throw away what is left of the old harvest to make room for the new."
Leviticus,26,11,"I will live among you in my sacred Tent, and I will never turn away from you."
Leviticus,26,12,"I will be with you; I will be your God, and you will be my people."
Leviticus,26,13,"I, the Lord your God, brought you out of Egypt so that you would no longer be slaves. I broke the power that held you down and I let you walk with your head held high.”"
Leviticus,26,14," The Lord said, “If you will not obey my commands, you will be punished."
Leviticus,26,15,"If you refuse to obey my laws and commands and break the covenant I have made with you,"
Leviticus,26,16,"I will punish you. I will bring disaster on you—incurable diseases and fevers that will make you blind and cause your life to waste away. You will plant your crops, but it will do you no good, because your enemies will conquer you and eat what you have grown."
Leviticus,26,17,"I will turn against you, so that you will be defeated, and those who hate you will rule over you; you will be so terrified that you will run when no one is chasing you."
Leviticus,26,18,"“If even after all of this you still do not obey me, I will increase your punishment seven times."
Leviticus,26,19,"I will break your stubborn pride; there will be no rain, and your land will be dry and as hard as iron."
Leviticus,26,20,"All your hard work will do you no good, because your land will not produce crops and the trees will not bear fruit."
Leviticus,26,21,"“If you still continue to resist me and refuse to obey me, I will again increase your punishment seven times."
Leviticus,26,22,"I will send dangerous animals among you, and they will kill your children, destroy your livestock, and leave so few of you that your roads will be deserted."
Leviticus,26,23,"“If after all of this punishment you still do not listen to me, but continue to defy me,"
Leviticus,26,24,then I will turn on you and punish you seven times harder than before.
Leviticus,26,25,"I will bring war on you to punish you for breaking our covenant, and if you gather in your cities for safety, I will send incurable diseases among you, and you will be forced to surrender to your enemies."
Leviticus,26,26,"I will cut off your food supply, so that ten women will need only one oven to bake all the bread they have. They will ration it out, and when you have eaten it all, you will still be hungry."
Leviticus,26,27,"“If after all of this you still continue to defy me and refuse to obey me,"
Leviticus,26,28,then in my anger I will turn on you and again make your punishment seven times worse than before.
Leviticus,26,29,Your hunger will be so great that you will eat your own children.
Leviticus,26,30,"I will destroy your places of worship on the hills, tear down your incense altars, and throw your dead bodies on your fallen idols. In utter disgust"
Leviticus,26,31,"I will turn your cities into ruins, destroy your places of worship, and refuse to accept your sacrifices."
Leviticus,26,32,I will destroy your land so completely that the enemies who occupy it will be shocked at the destruction.
Leviticus,26,33,"I will bring war on you and scatter you in foreign lands. Your land will be deserted, and your cities left in ruins."
Leviticus,27,1,The Lord gave Moses
Leviticus,27,2,"the following regulations for the people of Israel. When any of you have been given to the Lord in fulfillment of a special vow, you may be set free by the payment of the following sums of money,"
