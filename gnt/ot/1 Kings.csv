1 Kings,1,1,"King David was now a very old man, and although his servants covered him with blankets, he could not keep warm."
1 Kings,1,2,"So his officials said to him, “Your Majesty, let us find a young woman to stay with you and take care of you. She will lie close to you and keep you warm.”"
1 Kings,1,3,"A search was made all over Israel for a beautiful young woman, and in Shunem they found such a woman named Abishag, and brought her to the king."
1 Kings,1,4,"She was very beautiful, and waited on the king and took care of him, but he did not have intercourse with her."
1 Kings,2,1,"When David was about to die, he called his son Solomon and gave him his last instructions:"
1 Kings,2,2,"“My time to die has come. Be confident and determined,"
1 Kings,2,3,"and do what the Lord your God orders you to do. Obey all his laws and commands, as written in the Law of Moses, so that wherever you go you may prosper in everything you do."
1 Kings,2,4,"If you obey him, the Lord will keep the promise he made when he told me that my descendants would rule Israel as long as they were careful to obey his commands faithfully with all their heart and soul."
1 Kings,2,5," “There is something else. You remember what Joab did to me by killing the two commanders of Israel's armies, Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether. You remember how he murdered them in time of peace as revenge for deaths they had caused in time of war. He killed innocent men, and now I bear the responsibility for what he did, and I suffer the consequences."
1 Kings,2,6,You know what to do; you must not let him die a natural death.
1 Kings,2,7," “But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai from Gilead and take care of them, because they were kind to me when I was fleeing from your brother Absalom."
1 Kings,2,8," “There is also Shimei son of Gera, from the town of Bahurim in Benjamin. He cursed me bitterly the day I went to Mahanaim, but when he met me at the Jordan River, I gave him my solemn promise in the name of the Lord that I would not have him killed."
1 Kings,2,9,"But you must not let him go unpunished. You know what to do, and you must see to it that he is put to death.”"
1 Kings,2,10,David died and was buried in David's City.
1 Kings,2,11,"He had been king of Israel for forty years, ruling seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem."
1 Kings,2,12,"Solomon succeeded his father David as king, and his royal power was firmly established."
1 Kings,2,13,"Then Adonijah, whose mother was Haggith, went to Bathsheba, who was Solomon's mother. “Is this a friendly visit?” she asked. “It is,” he answered,"
1 Kings,2,14,"and then he added, “I have something to ask of you.” “What is it?” she asked."
1 Kings,2,15,"He answered, “You know that I should have become king and that everyone in Israel expected it. But it happened differently, and my brother became king because it was the Lord 's will."
1 Kings,2,16,And now I have one request to make; please do not refuse me.” “What is it?” Bathsheba asked.
1 Kings,2,17," He answered, “Please ask King Solomon—I know he won't refuse you—to let me have Abishag, the young woman from Shunem, as my wife.”"
1 Kings,2,18,"“Very well,” she answered. “I will speak to the king for you.”"
1 Kings,2,19,So Bathsheba went to the king to speak to him on behalf of Adonijah. The king stood up to greet his mother and bowed to her. Then he sat on his throne and had another one brought in on which she sat at his right.
1 Kings,2,20,"She said, “I have a small favor to ask of you; please do not refuse me.” “What is it, mother?” he asked. “I will not refuse you.”"
1 Kings,2,21,"She answered, “Let your brother Adonijah have Abishag as his wife.”"
1 Kings,2,22,"“Why do you ask me to give Abishag to him?” the king asked. “You might as well ask me to give him the throne too. After all, he is my older brother, and Abiathar the priest and Joab are on his side!”"
1 Kings,2,23,"Then Solomon made a solemn promise in the Lord 's name, “May God strike me dead if I don't make Adonijah pay with his life for asking this!"
1 Kings,2,24,The Lord has firmly established me on the throne of my father David; he has kept his promise and given the kingdom to me and my descendants. I swear by the living Lord that Adonijah will die this very day!”
1 Kings,2,25,"So King Solomon gave orders to Benaiah, who went out and killed Adonijah."
1 Kings,2,26," Then King Solomon said to Abiathar the priest, “Go to your country home in Anathoth. You deserve to die, but I will not have you put to death now, for you were in charge of the Lord 's Covenant Box while you were with my father David, and you shared in all his troubles.”"
1 Kings,2,27,"Then Solomon dismissed Abiathar from serving as a priest of the Lord , and so made come true what the Lord had said in Shiloh about the priest Eli and his descendants."
1 Kings,2,28,"Joab heard what had happened. (He had supported Adonijah, but not Absalom.) So he fled to the Tent of the Lord 's presence and took hold of the corners of the altar."
1 Kings,2,29,"When the news reached King Solomon that Joab had fled to the Tent and was by the altar, Solomon sent a messenger to Joab to ask him why he had fled to the altar. Joab answered that he had fled to the Lord because he was afraid of Solomon. So King Solomon sent Benaiah to kill Joab."
1 Kings,2,30,"He went to the Tent of the Lord 's presence and said to Joab, “The king orders you to come out.” “No,” Joab answered. “I will die here.” Benaiah went back to the king and told him what Joab had said."
1 Kings,2,31,"“Do what Joab says,” Solomon answered. “Kill him and bury him. Then neither I nor any other of David's descendants will any longer be held responsible for what Joab did when he killed innocent men."
1 Kings,2,32,"The Lord will punish Joab for those murders, which he committed without my father David's knowledge. Joab killed two innocent men who were better men than he: Abner, commander of the army of Israel, and Amasa, commander of the army of Judah."
1 Kings,2,33,The punishment for their murders will fall on Joab and on his descendants forever. But the Lord will always give success to David's descendants who sit on his throne.”
1 Kings,2,34,"So Benaiah went to the Tent of the Lord 's presence and killed Joab, and he was buried at his home in the open country."
1 Kings,2,35,The king made Benaiah commander of the army in Joab's place and put Zadok the priest in Abiathar's place.
1 Kings,2,36,"Then the king sent for Shimei and said to him, “Build a house for yourself here in Jerusalem. Live in it and don't leave the city."
1 Kings,2,37,"If you ever leave and go beyond Kidron Brook, you will certainly die—and you yourself will be to blame.”"
1 Kings,2,38,"“Very well, Your Majesty,” Shimei answered. “I will do what you say.” So he lived in Jerusalem a long time."
1 Kings,2,39,"Three years later, however, two of Shimei's slaves ran away to the king of Gath, Achish son of Maacah. When Shimei heard that they were in Gath,"
1 Kings,2,40,"he saddled his donkey and went to King Achish in Gath, to find his slaves. He found them and brought them back home."
1 Kings,2,41,"When Solomon heard what Shimei had done,"
1 Kings,2,42,"he sent for him and said, “I made you promise in the Lord 's name not to leave Jerusalem. And I warned you that if you ever did, you would certainly die. Did you not agree to it and say that you would obey me?"
1 Kings,2,43,"Why, then, have you broken your promise and disobeyed my command?"
1 Kings,2,44,You know very well all the wrong that you did to my father David. The Lord will punish you for it.
1 Kings,2,45,"But he will bless me, and he will make David's kingdom secure forever.”"
1 Kings,2,46,"Then the king gave orders to Benaiah, who went out and killed Shimei. Solomon was now in complete control."
1 Kings,3,1,"Solomon made an alliance with the king of Egypt by marrying his daughter. He brought her to live in David's City until he had finished building his palace, the Temple, and the wall around Jerusalem."
1 Kings,3,2,"A temple had not yet been built for the Lord , and so the people were still offering sacrifices at many different altars."
1 Kings,3,3,"Solomon loved the Lord and followed the instructions of his father David, but he also slaughtered animals and offered them as sacrifices on various altars."
1 Kings,3,4, On one occasion he went to Gibeon to offer sacrifices because that was where the most famous altar was. He had offered hundreds of burnt offerings there in the past.
1 Kings,3,5,"That night the Lord appeared to him in a dream and asked him, “What would you like me to give you?”"
1 Kings,3,6,"Solomon answered, “You always showed great love for my father David, your servant, and he was good, loyal, and honest in his relation with you. And you have continued to show him your great and constant love by giving him a son who today rules in his place."
1 Kings,3,7,"O Lord God, you have let me succeed my father as king, even though I am very young and don't know how to rule."
1 Kings,3,8,"Here I am among the people you have chosen to be your own, a people who are so many that they cannot be counted."
1 Kings,3,9,"So give me the wisdom I need to rule your people with justice and to know the difference between good and evil. Otherwise, how would I ever be able to rule this great people of yours?”"
1 Kings,3,10,"The Lord was pleased that Solomon had asked for this,"
1 Kings,3,11,"and so he said to him, “Because you have asked for the wisdom to rule justly, instead of long life for yourself or riches or the death of your enemies,"
1 Kings,3,12,I will do what you have asked. I will give you more wisdom and understanding than anyone has ever had before or will ever have again.
1 Kings,3,13,"I will also give you what you have not asked for: all your life you will have wealth and honor, more than that of any other king."
1 Kings,3,14,"And if you obey me and keep my laws and commands, as your father David did, I will give you a long life.”"
1 Kings,3,15,Solomon woke up and realized that God had spoken to him in the dream. Then he went to Jerusalem and stood in front of the Lord 's Covenant Box and offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to the Lord . After that he gave a feast for all his officials.
1 Kings,3,16,One day two prostitutes came and presented themselves before King Solomon.
1 Kings,3,17,"One of them said, “Your Majesty, this woman and I live in the same house, and I gave birth to a baby boy at home while she was there."
1 Kings,3,18,"Two days after my child was born, she also gave birth to a baby boy. Only the two of us were there in the house—no one else was present."
1 Kings,3,19,Then one night she accidentally rolled over on her baby and smothered it.
1 Kings,3,20,"She got up during the night, took my son from my side while I was asleep, and carried him to her bed; then she put the dead child in my bed."
1 Kings,3,21,"The next morning, when I woke up and was going to nurse my baby, I saw that it was dead. I looked at it more closely and saw that it was not my child.”"
1 Kings,3,22,"But the other woman said, “No! The living child is mine, and the dead one is yours!” The first woman answered back, “No! The dead child is yours, and the living one is mine!” And so they argued before the king."
1 Kings,3,23,"Then King Solomon said, “Each of you claims that the living child is hers and that the dead child belongs to the other one.”"
1 Kings,3,24,"He sent for a sword, and when it was brought,"
1 Kings,3,25,"he said, “Cut the living child in two and give each woman half of it.”"
1 Kings,3,26,"The real mother, her heart full of love for her son, said to the king, “Please, Your Majesty, don't kill the child! Give it to her!” But the other woman said, “Don't give it to either of us; go on and cut it in two.”"
1 Kings,3,27,"Then Solomon said, “Don't kill the child! Give it to the first woman—she is its real mother.”"
1 Kings,3,28,"When the people of Israel heard of Solomon's decision, they were all filled with deep respect for him, because they knew then that God had given him the wisdom to settle disputes fairly."
1 Kings,4,1,"Solomon was king of all Israel,"
1 Kings,4,2,and these were his high officials: The priest: Azariah son of Zadok
1 Kings,4,3,"The court secretaries: Elihoreph and Ahijah, sons of Shisha In charge of the records: Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud"
1 Kings,4,4,Commander of the army: Benaiah son of Jehoiada Priests: Zadok and Abiathar
1 Kings,4,5,Chief of the district governors: Azariah son of Nathan Royal Adviser: the priest Zabud son of Nathan
1 Kings,4,6,In charge of the palace servants: Ahishar In charge of the forced labor: Adoniram son of Abda
1 Kings,4,7,"Solomon appointed twelve men as district governors in Israel. They were to provide food from their districts for the king and his household, each man being responsible for one month out of the year."
1 Kings,4,8,The following are the names of these twelve officers and the districts they were in charge of: Benhur: the hill country of Ephraim
1 Kings,4,9,"Bendeker: the cities of Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth Shemesh, Elon, and Beth Hanan"
1 Kings,4,10,Benhesed: the cities of Arubboth and Socoh and all the territory of Hepher
1 Kings,4,11,"Benabinadab, who was married to Solomon's daughter Taphath: the whole region of Dor"
1 Kings,4,12,"Baana son of Ahilud: the cities of Taanach, Megiddo, and all the region near Beth Shan, near the town of Zarethan, south of the town of Jezreel, as far as the city of Abel Meholah and the city of Jokmeam"
1 Kings,4,13,"Bengeber: the city of Ramoth in Gilead, and the villages in Gilead belonging to the clan of Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, and the region of Argob in Bashan, sixty large towns in all, fortified with walls and with bronze bars on the gates"
1 Kings,4,14,Ahinadab son of Iddo: the district of Mahanaim
1 Kings,4,15,"Ahimaaz, who was married to Basemath, another of Solomon's daughters: the territory of Naphtali"
1 Kings,4,16,Baana son of Hushai: the region of Asher and the town of Bealoth
1 Kings,4,17,Jehoshaphat son of Paruah: the territory of Issachar
1 Kings,4,18,Shimei son of Ela: the territory of Benjamin
1 Kings,4,19,"Geber son of Uri: the region of Gilead, which had been ruled by King Sihon of the Amorites and King Og of Bashan Besides these twelve, there was one governor over the whole land."
1 Kings,4,20,"The people of Judah and Israel were as numerous as the grains of sand on the seashore; they ate and drank, and were happy."
1 Kings,4,21,Solomon's kingdom included all the nations from the Euphrates River to Philistia and the Egyptian border. They paid him taxes and were subject to him all his life.
1 Kings,4,22,The supplies Solomon needed each day were 150 bushels of fine flour and 300 bushels of meal;
1 Kings,4,23,"10 stall-fed cattle, 20 pasture-fed cattle, and 100 sheep, besides deer, gazelles, roebucks, and poultry."
1 Kings,4,24,"Solomon ruled over all the land west of the Euphrates River, from Tiphsah on the Euphrates as far west as the city of Gaza. All the kings west of the Euphrates were subject to him, and he was at peace with all the neighboring countries."
1 Kings,4,25,"As long as he lived, the people throughout Judah and Israel lived in safety, each family with its own grapevines and fig trees."
1 Kings,4,26, Solomon had forty thousand stalls for his chariot horses and twelve thousand cavalry horses.
1 Kings,4,27,"His twelve governors, each one in the month assigned to him, supplied the food King Solomon needed for himself and for all who ate in the palace; they always supplied everything needed."
1 Kings,4,28,"Each governor also supplied his share of barley and straw, where it was needed, for the chariot horses and the work animals."
1 Kings,4,29,"God gave Solomon unusual wisdom and insight, and knowledge too great to be measured."
1 Kings,4,30,Solomon was wiser than the wise men of the East or the wise men of Egypt.
1 Kings,4,31,"He was the wisest of all men: wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol, and his fame spread throughout all the neighboring countries."
1 Kings,4,32,He composed three thousand proverbs and more than a thousand songs.
1 Kings,4,33,"He spoke of trees and plants, from the Lebanon cedars to the hyssop that grows on walls; he talked about animals, birds, reptiles, and fish."
1 Kings,4,34,Kings all over the world heard of his wisdom and sent people to listen to him.
1 Kings,5,1,"King Hiram of Tyre had always been a friend of David's, and when he heard that Solomon had succeeded his father David as king, he sent ambassadors to him."
1 Kings,5,2,Solomon sent back this message to Hiram:
1 Kings,5,3,"“You know that because of the constant wars my father David had to fight against the enemy countries all around him, he could not build a temple for the worship of the Lord his God until the Lord had given him victory over all his enemies."
1 Kings,5,4,"But now the Lord my God has given me peace on all my borders. I have no enemies, and there is no danger of attack."
1 Kings,5,5,"The Lord promised my father David, ‘Your son, whom I will make king after you, will build a temple for me.’ And I have now decided to build that temple for the worship of the Lord my God."
1 Kings,5,6,"So send your men to Lebanon to cut down cedars for me. My men will work with them, and I will pay your men whatever you decide. As you well know, my men don't know how to cut down trees as well as yours do.”"
1 Kings,5,7,"Hiram was extremely pleased when he received Solomon's message, and he said, “Praise the Lord today for giving David such a wise son to succeed him as king of that great nation!”"
1 Kings,5,8,"Then Hiram sent Solomon the following message: “I have received your message, and I am ready to do what you ask. I will provide the cedars and the pine trees."
1 Kings,5,9,"My men will bring the logs down from Lebanon to the sea and will tie them together in rafts to float them down the coast to the place you choose. There my men will untie them, and your men will take charge of them. On your part, I would like you to supply the food for my men.”"
1 Kings,5,10,"So Hiram supplied Solomon with all the cedar and pine logs that he wanted,"
1 Kings,5,11,"and Solomon provided Hiram with 100,000 bushels of wheat and 110,000 gallons of pure olive oil every year to feed his men."
1 Kings,5,12,"The Lord kept his promise and gave Solomon wisdom. There was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and they made a treaty with each other."
1 Kings,5,13,"King Solomon drafted 30,000 men as forced labor from all over Israel,"
1 Kings,5,14,"and put Adoniram in charge of them. He divided them into three groups of 10,000 men, and each group spent one month in Lebanon and two months back home."
1 Kings,5,15,"Solomon also had 80,000 stone cutters in the hill country, with 70,000 men to carry the stones,"
1 Kings,5,16,"and he placed 3,300 foremen in charge of them to supervise their work."
1 Kings,5,17,At King Solomon's command they cut fine large stones for the foundation of the Temple.
1 Kings,5,18,Solomon's and Hiram's workers and men from the city of Byblos prepared the stones and the timber to build the Temple.
1 Kings,6,1,"Four hundred and eighty years after the people of Israel left Egypt, during the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the second month, the month of Ziv, Solomon began work on the Temple."
1 Kings,6,2,"Inside it was 90 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 45 feet high."
1 Kings,6,3,"The entrance room was 15 feet deep and 30 feet wide, as wide as the sanctuary itself."
1 Kings,6,4,"The walls of the Temple had openings in them, narrower on the outside than on the inside."
1 Kings,6,5,"Against the outside walls, on the sides and the back of the Temple, a three-storied annex was built, each story 7½ feet high."
1 Kings,6,6,"Each room in the lowest story was 7½ feet wide, in the middle story 9 feet wide, and in the top story 10½ feet wide. The Temple wall on each floor was thinner than on the floor below, so that the rooms could rest on the wall without having their beams built into it."
1 Kings,6,7,"The stones with which the Temple was built had been prepared at the quarry, so that there was no noise made by hammers, axes, or any other iron tools as the Temple was being built."
1 Kings,6,8,"The entrance to the lowest story of the annex was on the south side of the Temple, with stairs leading up to the second and third stories."
1 Kings,6,9,So King Solomon finished building the Temple. He put in a ceiling made of beams and boards of cedar.
1 Kings,6,10,"The three-storied annex, each story 7½ feet high, was built against the outside walls of the Temple, and was joined to them by cedar beams."
1 Kings,6,11,"The Lord said to Solomon,"
1 Kings,6,12,"“If you obey all my laws and commands, I will do for you what I promised your father David."
1 Kings,6,13,"I will live among my people Israel in this Temple that you are building, and I will never abandon them.”"
1 Kings,6,14,So Solomon finished building the Temple.
1 Kings,6,15,"The inside walls were covered with cedar panels from the floor to the ceiling, and the floor was made of pine."
1 Kings,6,16,"An inner room, called the Most Holy Place, was built in the rear of the Temple. It was 30 feet long and was partitioned off by cedar boards reaching from the floor to the ceiling."
1 Kings,6,17,The room in front of the Most Holy Place was 60 feet long.
1 Kings,6,18,"The cedar panels were decorated with carvings of gourds and flowers; the whole interior was covered with cedar, so that the stones of the walls could not be seen."
1 Kings,6,19,"In the rear of the Temple an inner room was built, where the Lord 's Covenant Box was to be placed."
1 Kings,6,20,"This inner room was 30 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 30 feet high, all covered with pure gold. The altar was covered with cedar panels."
1 Kings,6,21,"The inside of the Temple was covered with gold, and gold chains were placed across the entrance of the inner room, which was also covered with gold."
1 Kings,6,22,"The whole interior of the Temple was covered with gold, as well as the altar in the Most Holy Place."
1 Kings,6,23," Two winged creatures were made of olive wood and placed in the Most Holy Place, each one 15 feet tall."
1 Kings,7,1,"Solomon also built a palace for himself, and it took him thirteen years."
1 Kings,8,1," Then King Solomon summoned all the leaders of the tribes and clans of Israel to come to him in Jerusalem in order to take the Lord 's Covenant Box from Zion, David's City, to the Temple."
1 Kings,8,2,"They all assembled during the Festival of Shelters in the seventh month, in the month of Ethanim."
1 Kings,8,3,"When all the leaders had gathered, the priests lifted the Covenant Box"
1 Kings,8,4,and carried it to the Temple. The Levites and the priests also moved the Tent of the Lord 's presence and all its equipment to the Temple.
1 Kings,8,5,King Solomon and all the people of Israel assembled in front of the Covenant Box and sacrificed a large number of sheep and cattle—too many to count.
1 Kings,8,6,"Then the priests carried the Covenant Box into the Temple and put it in the Most Holy Place, beneath the winged creatures."
1 Kings,8,7,Their outstretched wings covered the box and the poles it was carried by.
1 Kings,8,8,"The ends of the poles could be seen by anyone standing directly in front of the Most Holy Place, but from nowhere else. (The poles are still there today.)"
1 Kings,8,9,"There was nothing inside the Covenant Box except the two stone tablets which Moses had placed there at Mount Sinai, when the Lord made a covenant with the people of Israel as they were coming from Egypt."
1 Kings,8,10," As the priests were leaving the Temple, it was suddenly filled with a cloud"
1 Kings,8,11,"shining with the dazzling light of the Lord 's presence, and they could not go back in to perform their duties."
1 Kings,8,12,"Then Solomon prayed: “You, Lord , have placed the sun in the sky, yet you have chosen to live in clouds and darkness."
1 Kings,8,13,"Now I have built a majestic temple for you, a place for you to live in forever.”"
1 Kings,8,14,"As the people stood there, King Solomon turned to face them, and he asked God's blessing on them."
1 Kings,8,15,"He said, “Praise the Lord God of Israel! He has kept the promise he made to my father David, when he told him,"
1 Kings,8,16,"‘From the time I brought my people out of Egypt, I have not chosen any city in all the land of Israel in which a temple should be built where I would be worshiped. But I chose you, David, to rule my people.’”"
1 Kings,8,17," And Solomon continued, “My father David planned to build a temple for the worship of the Lord God of Israel,"
1 Kings,8,18,"but the Lord said to him, ‘You were right in wanting to build a temple for me,"
1 Kings,8,19,"but you will never build it. It is your son, your own son, who will build my temple.’"
1 Kings,8,20,"“And now the Lord has kept his promise. I have succeeded my father as king of Israel, and I have built the Temple for the worship of the Lord God of Israel."
1 Kings,8,21,I have also provided a place in the Temple for the Covenant Box containing the stone tablets of the covenant which the Lord made with our ancestors when he brought them out of Egypt.”
1 Kings,8,22,"Then in the presence of the people Solomon went and stood in front of the altar, where he raised his arms"
1 Kings,8,23,"and prayed, “ Lord God of Israel, there is no god like you in heaven above or on earth below! You keep your covenant with your people and show them your love when they live in wholehearted obedience to you."
1 Kings,8,24,You have kept the promise you made to my father David; today every word has been fulfilled.
1 Kings,8,25,"And now, Lord God of Israel, I pray that you will also keep the other promise you made to my father when you told him that there would always be one of his descendants ruling as king of Israel, provided they obeyed you as carefully as he did."
1 Kings,8,26,"So now, O God of Israel, let everything come true that you promised to my father David, your servant."
1 Kings,8,27," “But can you, O God, really live on earth? Not even all of heaven is large enough to hold you, so how can this Temple that I have built be large enough?"
1 Kings,8,28,"Lord my God, I am your servant. Listen to my prayer, and grant the requests I make to you today."
1 Kings,8,29,"Watch over this Temple day and night, this place where you have chosen to be worshiped. Hear me when I face this Temple and pray."
1 Kings,8,30,Hear my prayers and the prayers of your people when they face this place and pray. In your home in heaven hear us and forgive us.
1 Kings,8,31,"“When a person is accused of wronging another and is brought to your altar in this Temple to take an oath that he is innocent,"
1 Kings,8,32,"O Lord , listen in heaven and judge your servants. Punish the guilty one as he deserves, and acquit the one who is innocent."
1 Kings,8,33,"“When your people Israel are defeated by their enemies because they have sinned against you, and then when they turn to you and come to this Temple, humbly praying to you for forgiveness,"
1 Kings,8,34,listen to them in heaven. Forgive the sins of your people and bring them back to the land which you gave to their ancestors.
1 Kings,8,35,"“When you hold back the rain because your people have sinned against you, and then when they repent and face this Temple, humbly praying to you,"
1 Kings,8,36,"listen to them in heaven. Forgive the sins of the king and of the people of Israel, and teach them to do what is right. Then, O Lord , send rain on this land of yours, which you gave to your people as a permanent possession."
1 Kings,8,37,"“When there is famine in the land or an epidemic or the crops are destroyed by scorching winds or swarms of locusts, or when your people are attacked by their enemies, or when there is disease or sickness among them,"
1 Kings,8,38,"listen to their prayers. If any of your people Israel, out of heartfelt sorrow, stretch out their hands in prayer toward this Temple,"
1 Kings,8,39,"hear their prayer. Listen to them in your home in heaven, forgive them, and help them. You alone know the thoughts of the human heart. Deal with each person as he deserves,"
1 Kings,8,40,so that your people may obey you all the time they live in the land which you gave to our ancestors.
1 Kings,9,1,"After King Solomon had finished building the Temple and the palace and everything else he wanted to build,"
1 Kings,9,2,"the Lord appeared to him again, as he had in Gibeon."
1 Kings,9,3,"The Lord said to him, “I have heard your prayer. I consecrate this Temple which you have built as the place where I shall be worshiped forever. I will watch over it and protect it for all time."
1 Kings,9,4,"If you will serve me in honesty and integrity, as your father David did, and if you obey my laws and do everything I have commanded you,"
1 Kings,9,5,I will keep the promise I made to your father David when I told him that Israel would always be ruled by his descendants.
1 Kings,9,6,"But if you or your descendants stop following me, disobey the laws and commands I have given you, and worship other gods,"
1 Kings,9,7,then I will remove my people Israel from the land that I have given them. I will also abandon this Temple which I have consecrated as the place where I am to be worshiped. People everywhere will ridicule Israel and treat her with contempt.
1 Kings,9,8,"This Temple will become a pile of ruins, and everyone who passes by will be shocked and amazed. ‘Why did the Lord do this to this land and this Temple?’ they will ask."
1 Kings,9,9,"People will answer, ‘It is because they abandoned the Lord their God, who brought their ancestors out of Egypt. They gave their allegiance to other gods and worshiped them. That is why the Lord has brought this disaster on them.’”"
1 Kings,9,10,It took Solomon twenty years to build the Temple and his palace.
1 Kings,9,11,"King Hiram of Tyre had provided him with all the cedar and pine and with all the gold he wanted for this work. After it was finished, King Solomon gave Hiram twenty towns in the region of Galilee."
1 Kings,9,12,"Hiram went to see them, and he did not like them."
1 Kings,9,13,"So he said to Solomon, “So these, my brother, are the towns you have given me!” For this reason the area is still called Cabul."
1 Kings,9,14,Hiram had sent Solomon almost five tons of gold.
1 Kings,9,15,"King Solomon used forced labor to build the Temple and the palace, to fill in land on the east side of the city, and to build the city wall. He also used it to rebuild the cities of Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer. ("
1 Kings,9,16,"The king of Egypt had attacked Gezer and captured it, killing its inhabitants and setting fire to the city. Then he gave it as a wedding present to his daughter when she married Solomon,"
1 Kings,9,17,"and Solomon rebuilt it.) Using his forced labor, Solomon also rebuilt Lower Beth Horon,"
1 Kings,9,18,"Baalath, Tamar in the wilderness of Judah,"
1 Kings,9,19,"the cities where his supplies were kept, the cities for his horses and chariots, and everything else he wanted to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and elsewhere in his kingdom."
1 Kings,10,1," The queen of Sheba heard of Solomon's fame, and she traveled to Jerusalem to test him with difficult questions."
1 Kings,10,2,"She brought with her a large group of attendants, as well as camels loaded with spices, jewels, and a large amount of gold. When she and Solomon met, she asked him all the questions that she could think of."
1 Kings,10,3,He answered them all; there was nothing too difficult for him to explain.
1 Kings,10,4,The queen of Sheba heard Solomon's wisdom and saw the palace he had built.
1 Kings,10,5,"She saw the food that was served at his table, the living quarters for his officials, the organization of his palace staff and the uniforms they wore, the servants who waited on him at feasts, and the sacrifices he offered in the Temple. It left her breathless and amazed."
1 Kings,10,6,"She said to King Solomon, “What I heard in my own country about you and your wisdom is true!"
1 Kings,10,7,But I couldn't believe it until I had come and seen it all for myself. But I didn't hear even half of it; your wisdom and wealth are much greater than what I was told.
1 Kings,10,8,"How fortunate are your wives! And how fortunate your servants, who are always in your presence and are privileged to hear your wise sayings!"
1 Kings,10,9,"Praise the Lord your God! He has shown how pleased he is with you by making you king of Israel. Because his love for Israel is eternal, he has made you their king so that you can maintain law and justice.”"
1 Kings,10,10,She presented to King Solomon the gifts she had brought: almost five tons of gold and a very large amount of spices and jewels. The amount of spices she gave him was by far the greatest that he ever received at any time.(
1 Kings,10,11,"Hiram's fleet, which had brought gold from Ophir, also brought from there a large amount of juniper wood and jewels."
1 Kings,10,12,"Solomon used the wood to build railings in the Temple and the palace, and also to make harps and lyres for the musicians. It was the finest juniper wood ever imported into Israel; none like it has ever been seen again.)"
1 Kings,10,13,"King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba everything she asked for, besides all the other customary gifts that he had generously given her. Then she and her attendants returned to the land of Sheba."
1 Kings,10,14,"Every year King Solomon received over twenty-five tons of gold,"
1 Kings,10,15,"in addition to the taxes paid by merchants, the profits from trade, and tribute paid by the Arabian kings and the governors of the Israelite districts."
1 Kings,10,16,Solomon made two hundred large shields and had each one overlaid with almost fifteen pounds of gold.
1 Kings,10,17,"He also made three hundred smaller shields, overlaying each one of them with nearly four pounds of gold. He had all these shields placed in the Hall of the Forest of Lebanon."
1 Kings,10,18,He also had a large throne made. Part of it was covered with ivory and the rest of it was covered with the finest gold.
1 Kings,11,1," Solomon loved many foreign women. Besides the daughter of the king of Egypt he married Hittite women and women from Moab, Ammon, Edom, and Sidon."
1 Kings,11,2,"He married them even though the Lord had commanded the Israelites not to intermarry with these people, because they would cause the Israelites to give their loyalty to other gods."
1 Kings,11,3,"Solomon married seven hundred princesses and also had three hundred concubines. They made him turn away from God,"
1 Kings,11,4,"and by the time he was old they had led him into the worship of foreign gods. He was not faithful to the Lord his God, as his father David had been."
1 Kings,11,5,"He worshiped Astarte, the goddess of Sidon, and Molech, the disgusting god of Ammon."
1 Kings,11,6,He sinned against the Lord and was not true to him as his father David had been.
1 Kings,11,7,"On the mountain east of Jerusalem he built a place to worship Chemosh, the disgusting god of Moab, and a place to worship Molech, the disgusting god of Ammon."
1 Kings,11,8,He also built places of worship where all his foreign wives could burn incense and offer sacrifices to their own gods.
1 Kings,12,1,"Rehoboam went to Shechem, where all the people of northern Israel had gathered to make him king."
1 Kings,12,2,"When Jeroboam son of Nebat, who had gone to Egypt to escape from King Solomon, heard this news, he returned from Egypt."
1 Kings,12,3,"The people of the northern tribes sent for him, and then they all went together to Rehoboam and said to him,"
1 Kings,12,4,"“Your father Solomon treated us harshly and placed heavy burdens on us. If you make these burdens lighter and make life easier for us, we will be your loyal subjects.”"
1 Kings,12,5,"“Come back in three days and I will give you my answer,” he replied. So they left."
1 Kings,12,6,King Rehoboam consulted the older men who had served as his father Solomon's advisers. “What answer do you advise me to give these people?” he asked.
1 Kings,12,7,"They replied, “If you want to serve this people well, give a favorable answer to their request, and they will always serve you loyally.”"
1 Kings,12,8,But he ignored the advice of the older men and went instead to the young men who had grown up with him and who were now his advisers.
1 Kings,12,9,“What do you advise me to do?” he asked. “What shall I say to the people who are asking me to make their burdens lighter?”
1 Kings,12,10,"They replied, “This is what you should tell them: ‘My little finger is thicker than my father's waist!’"
1 Kings,12,11,"Tell them, ‘My father placed heavy burdens on you; I will make them even heavier. He beat you with whips; I'll flog you with bullwhips!’”"
1 Kings,12,12,"Three days later Jeroboam and all the people returned to King Rehoboam, as he had instructed them."
1 Kings,12,13,"The king ignored the advice of the older men and spoke harshly to the people,"
1 Kings,12,14,"as the younger men had advised. He said, “My father placed heavy burdens on you; I will make them even heavier. He beat you with whips; I'll flog you with bullwhips!”"
1 Kings,12,15,It was the will of the Lord to bring about what he had spoken to Jeroboam son of Nebat through the prophet Ahijah from Shiloh. This is why the king did not pay any attention to the people.
1 Kings,12,16," When the people saw that the king would not listen to them, they shouted, “Down with David and his family! What have they ever done for us? People of Israel, let's go home! Let Rehoboam look out for himself!” So the people of Israel rebelled,"
1 Kings,12,17,leaving Rehoboam as king only of the people who lived in the territory of Judah.
1 Kings,12,18,"Then King Rehoboam sent Adoniram, who was in charge of the forced labor, to go to the Israelites, but they stoned him to death. At this, Rehoboam hurriedly got in his chariot and escaped to Jerusalem."
1 Kings,12,19,Ever since that time the people of the northern kingdom of Israel have been in rebellion against the dynasty of David.
1 Kings,12,20,"When the people of Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned from Egypt, they invited him to a meeting of the people and made him king of Israel. Only the tribe of Judah remained loyal to David's descendants."
1 Kings,12,21,"When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he called together 180,000 of the best soldiers from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. He intended to go to war and restore his control over the northern tribes of Israel."
1 Kings,12,22,But God told the prophet Shemaiah
1 Kings,12,23,to give this message to Rehoboam and to all the people of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin:
1 Kings,12,24,"“Do not attack your own relatives, the people of Israel. Go home, all of you. What has happened is my will.” They all obeyed the Lord 's command and went back home."
1 Kings,12,25,King Jeroboam of Israel fortified the town of Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there for a while. Then he left and fortified the town of Penuel.
1 Kings,13,1,At the Lord 's command a prophet from Judah went to Bethel and arrived there as Jeroboam stood at the altar to offer the sacrifice.
1 Kings,13,2,"Following the Lord 's command, the prophet denounced the altar: “O altar, altar, this is what the Lord says: A child, whose name will be Josiah, will be born to the family of David. He will slaughter on you the priests serving at the pagan altars who offer sacrifices on you, and he will burn human bones on you.”"
1 Kings,13,3,"And the prophet went on to say, “This altar will fall apart, and the ashes on it will be scattered. Then you will know that the Lord has spoken through me.”"
1 Kings,13,4,"When King Jeroboam heard this, he pointed at him and ordered, “Seize that man!” At once the king's arm became paralyzed so that he couldn't pull it back."
1 Kings,13,5,"The altar suddenly fell apart and the ashes spilled to the ground, as the prophet had predicted in the name of the Lord."
1 Kings,13,6,"King Jeroboam said to the prophet, “Please pray for me to the Lord your God, and ask him to heal my arm!” The prophet prayed to the Lord , and the king's arm was healed."
1 Kings,13,7,"Then the king said to the prophet, “Come home with me and have something to eat. I will reward you for what you have done.”"
1 Kings,13,8,"The prophet answered, “Even if you gave me half of your wealth, I would not go with you or eat or drink anything with you."
1 Kings,13,9,"The Lord has commanded me not to eat or drink a thing, and not to return home the same way I came.”"
1 Kings,13,10,"So he did not go back the same way he had come, but by another road."
1 Kings,13,11,At that time there was an old prophet living in Bethel. His sons came and told him what the prophet from Judah had done in Bethel that day and what he had said to King Jeroboam.
1 Kings,13,12,“Which way did he go when he left?” the old prophet asked them. They showed him the road
1 Kings,13,13,"and he told them to saddle his donkey for him. They did so, and he rode off"
1 Kings,13,14,"down the road after the prophet from Judah and found him sitting under an oak tree. “Are you the prophet from Judah?” he asked. “I am,” the man answered."
1 Kings,13,15,"“Come home and have a meal with me,” he said."
1 Kings,13,16,"But the prophet from Judah answered, “I can't go home with you or accept your hospitality. And I won't eat or drink anything with you here,"
1 Kings,13,17,"because the Lord has commanded me not to eat or drink a thing, and not to return home the same way I came.”"
1 Kings,13,18,"Then the old prophet from Bethel said to him, “I, too, am a prophet just like you, and at the Lord 's command an angel told me to take you home with me and offer you my hospitality.” But the old prophet was lying."
1 Kings,13,19,So the prophet from Judah went home with the old prophet and had a meal with him.
1 Kings,13,20,"As they were sitting at the table, the word of the Lord came to the old prophet,"
1 Kings,13,21,"and he cried out to the prophet from Judah, “The Lord says that you disobeyed him and did not do what he commanded."
1 Kings,13,22,"Instead, you returned and ate a meal in a place he had ordered you not to eat in. Because of this you will be killed, and your body will not be buried in your family grave.”"
1 Kings,13,23,"After they had finished eating, the old prophet saddled the donkey for the prophet from Judah,"
1 Kings,13,24,"who rode off. On the way a lion met him and killed him. His body lay on the road, and the donkey and the lion stood beside it."
1 Kings,13,25,"Some men passed by and saw the body on the road, with the lion standing near by. They went on into Bethel and reported what they had seen."
1 Kings,13,26,"When the old prophet heard about it, he said, “That is the prophet who disobeyed the Lord 's command! And so the Lord sent the lion to attack and kill him, just as the Lord said he would.”"
1 Kings,13,27,"Then he said to his sons, “Saddle my donkey for me.” They did so,"
1 Kings,13,28,"and he rode off and found the prophet's body lying on the road, with the donkey and the lion still standing by it. The lion had not eaten the body or attacked the donkey."
1 Kings,13,29,"The old prophet picked up the body, put it on the donkey, and brought it back to Bethel to mourn over it and bury it."
1 Kings,13,30,"He buried it in his own family grave, and he and his sons mourned over it, saying, “Oh my brother, my brother!”"
1 Kings,13,31,"After the burial the prophet said to his sons, “When I die, bury me in this grave and lay my body next to his."
1 Kings,13,32,The words that he spoke at the Lord 's command against the altar in Bethel and against all the places of worship in the towns of Samaria will surely come true.”
1 Kings,13,33,King Jeroboam of Israel still did not turn from his evil ways but continued to choose priests from ordinary families to serve at the altars he had built. He ordained as priest anyone who wanted to be one.
1 Kings,13,34,This sin on his part brought about the ruin and total destruction of his dynasty.
1 Kings,14,1,At that time King Jeroboam's son Abijah got sick.
1 Kings,14,2,"Jeroboam said to his wife, “Disguise yourself so that no one will recognize you, and go to Shiloh, where the prophet Ahijah lives, the one who said I would be king of Israel."
1 Kings,14,3,"Take him ten loaves of bread, some cakes, and a jar of honey. Ask him what is going to happen to our son, and he will tell you.”"
1 Kings,14,4,So she went to Ahijah's home in Shiloh. Old age had made Ahijah blind.
1 Kings,14,5,"The Lord had told him that Jeroboam's wife was coming to ask him about her son, who was sick. And the Lord told Ahijah what to say. When Jeroboam's wife arrived, she pretended to be someone else."
1 Kings,14,6,"But when Ahijah heard her coming in the door, he said, “Come in. I know you are Jeroboam's wife. Why are you pretending to be someone else? I have bad news for you."
1 Kings,14,7,"Go and tell Jeroboam that this is what the Lord , the God of Israel, says to him: ‘I chose you from among the people and made you the ruler of my people Israel."
1 Kings,14,8,"I took the kingdom away from David's descendants and gave it to you. But you have not been like my servant David, who was completely loyal to me, obeyed my commands, and did only what I approve of."
1 Kings,14,9,You have committed far greater sins than those who ruled before you. You have rejected me and have aroused my anger by making idols and metal images to worship.
1 Kings,14,10,"Because of this I will bring disaster on your dynasty and will kill all your male descendants, young and old alike. I will get rid of your family; they will be swept away like dung."
1 Kings,14,11,"Any members of your family who die in the city will be eaten by dogs, and any who die in the open country will be eaten by vultures. I, the Lord , have spoken.’”"
1 Kings,14,12,"And Ahijah went on to say to Jeroboam's wife, “Now go back home. As soon as you enter the town, your son will die."
1 Kings,14,13,"All the people of Israel will mourn for him and bury him. He will be the only member of Jeroboam's family who will be properly buried, because he is the only one with whom the Lord , the God of Israel, is pleased."
1 Kings,14,14,The Lord is going to place a king over Israel who will put an end to Jeroboam's dynasty.
1 Kings,14,15,"The Lord will punish Israel, and she will shake like a reed shaking in a stream. He will uproot the people of Israel from this good land which he gave to their ancestors, and he will scatter them beyond the Euphrates River, because they have aroused his anger by making idols of the goddess Asherah."
1 Kings,14,16,The Lord will abandon Israel because Jeroboam sinned and led the people of Israel into sin.”
1 Kings,14,17,"Jeroboam's wife went back to Tirzah. Just as she entered her home, the child died."
1 Kings,14,18,"The people of Israel mourned for him and buried him, as the Lord had said through his servant, the prophet Ahijah."
1 Kings,14,19,"Everything else that King Jeroboam did, the wars he fought and how he ruled, are all recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel."
1 Kings,14,20,"Jeroboam ruled as king for twenty-two years. He died and was buried, and his son Nadab succeeded him as king."
1 Kings,14,21,"Solomon's son Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the Lord had chosen from all the territory of Israel as the place where he was to be worshiped. Rehoboam's mother was Naamah from Ammon."
1 Kings,14,22,The people of Judah sinned against the Lord and did more to arouse his anger against them than all their ancestors had done.
1 Kings,14,23,They built places of worship for false gods and put up stone pillars and symbols of Asherah to worship on the hills and under shady trees.
1 Kings,14,24,"Worst of all, there were men and women who served as prostitutes at those pagan places of worship. The people of Judah practiced all the shameful things done by the people whom the Lord had driven out of the land as the Israelites advanced into the country."
1 Kings,14,25, In the fifth year of Rehoboam's reign King Shishak of Egypt attacked Jerusalem.
1 Kings,14,26,"He took away all the treasures in the Temple and in the palace, including the gold shields Solomon had made."
1 Kings,14,27,"To replace them, King Rehoboam made bronze shields and entrusted them to the officers responsible for guarding the palace gates."
1 Kings,14,28,"Every time the king went to the Temple, the guards carried the shields and then returned them to the guardroom."
1 Kings,14,29,Everything else that King Rehoboam did is recorded in The History of the Kings of Judah.
1 Kings,14,30,During all this time Rehoboam and Jeroboam were constantly at war with each other.
1 Kings,14,31,Rehoboam died and was buried in the royal tombs in David's City and his son Abijah succeeded him as king.
1 Kings,15,1,"In the eighteenth year of the reign of King Jeroboam of Israel, Abijah became king of Judah,"
1 Kings,15,2,"and he ruled three years in Jerusalem. His mother was Maacah, the daughter of Absalom."
1 Kings,15,3,"He committed the same sins as his father and was not completely loyal to the Lord his God, as his great-grandfather David had been."
1 Kings,15,4,But for David's sake the Lord his God gave Abijah a son to rule after him in Jerusalem and to keep Jerusalem secure.
1 Kings,15,5,"The Lord did this because David had done what pleased him and had never disobeyed any of his commands, except in the case of Uriah the Hittite."
1 Kings,15,6,The war which had begun between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continued throughout Abijah's lifetime.
1 Kings,15,7,And everything else that Abijah did is recorded in The History of the Kings of Judah.
1 Kings,15,8,"Abijah died and was buried in David's City, and his son Asa succeeded him as king."
1 Kings,15,9,"In the twentieth year of the reign of King Jeroboam of Israel, Asa became king of Judah,"
1 Kings,15,10,"and he ruled forty-one years in Jerusalem. His grandmother was Maacah, the daughter of Absalom."
1 Kings,15,11,"Asa did what pleased the Lord , as his ancestor David had done."
1 Kings,15,12,"He expelled from the country all the male and female prostitutes serving at the pagan places of worship, and he removed all the idols his predecessors had made."
1 Kings,15,13,"He removed his grandmother Maacah from her position as queen mother, because she had made an obscene idol of the fertility goddess Asherah. Asa cut down the idol and burned it in Kidron Valley."
1 Kings,15,14,"Even though Asa did not destroy all the pagan places of worship, he remained faithful to the Lord all his life."
1 Kings,15,15,"He placed in the Temple all the objects his father had dedicated to God, as well as the gold and silver objects that he himself dedicated."
1 Kings,15,16,King Asa of Judah and King Baasha of Israel were constantly at war with each other as long as they were in power.
1 Kings,15,17,Baasha invaded Judah and started to fortify Ramah in order to cut off all traffic in and out of Judah.
1 Kings,15,18,"So King Asa took all the silver and gold that was left in the Temple and the palace, and sent it by some of his officials to Damascus, to King Benhadad of Syria, the son of Tabrimmon and grandson of Hezion, with this message:"
1 Kings,15,19,"“Let us be allies, as our fathers were. This silver and gold is a present for you. Now break your alliance with King Baasha of Israel, so that he will have to pull his troops out of my territory.”"
1 Kings,15,20,"King Benhadad agreed to Asa's proposal and sent his commanding officers and their armies to attack the cities of Israel. They captured Ijon, Dan, Abel Beth Maacah, the area near Lake Galilee, and the whole territory of Naphtali."
1 Kings,15,21,"When King Baasha heard what had happened, he stopped fortifying Ramah and went to Tirzah."
1 Kings,15,22,"Then King Asa sent out an order throughout all of Judah requiring everyone, without exception, to help carry away from Ramah the stones and timber that Baasha had been using to fortify it. With this material Asa fortified Mizpah and Geba, a city in the territory of Benjamin."
1 Kings,15,23,"Everything else that King Asa did, his brave deeds and the towns he fortified, are all recorded in The History of the Kings of Judah . But in his old age he was crippled by a foot disease."
1 Kings,15,24,"Asa died and was buried in the royal tombs in David's City, and his son Jehoshaphat succeeded him as king."
1 Kings,15,25,"In the second year of the reign of King Asa of Judah, King Jeroboam's son Nadab became king of Israel, and he ruled for two years."
1 Kings,15,26,"Like his father before him, he sinned against the Lord and led Israel into sin."
1 Kings,15,27,"Baasha son of Ahijah, of the tribe of Issachar, plotted against Nadab and killed him as Nadab and his army were besieging the city of Gibbethon in Philistia."
1 Kings,15,28,This happened during the third year of the reign of King Asa of Judah. And so Baasha succeeded Nadab as king of Israel.
1 Kings,15,29,"At once he began killing all the members of Jeroboam's family. In accordance with what the Lord had said through his servant, the prophet Ahijah from Shiloh, all of Jeroboam's family were killed; not one survived."
1 Kings,15,30,"This happened because Jeroboam aroused the anger of the Lord , the God of Israel, by the sins that he committed and that he caused Israel to commit."
1 Kings,15,31,Everything else that Nadab did is recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel.
1 Kings,15,32,King Asa of Judah and King Baasha of Israel were constantly at war with each other as long as they were in power.
1 Kings,15,33,"In the third year of the reign of King Asa of Judah, Baasha son of Ahijah became king of all Israel, and he ruled in Tirzah for twenty-four years."
1 Kings,15,34,"Like King Jeroboam before him, he sinned against the Lord and led Israel into sin."
1 Kings,16,1,The Lord spoke to the prophet Jehu son of Hanani and gave him this message for Baasha:
1 Kings,16,2,"“You were a nobody, but I made you the leader of my people Israel. And now you have sinned like Jeroboam and have led my people into sin. Their sins have aroused my anger,"
1 Kings,16,3,"and so I will do away with you and your family, just as I did with Jeroboam."
1 Kings,16,4,"Any members of your family who die in the city will be eaten by dogs, and any who die in the open country will be eaten by vultures.”"
1 Kings,16,5,Everything else that Baasha did and all his brave deeds are recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel.
1 Kings,16,6,"Baasha died and was buried in Tirzah, and his son Elah succeeded him as king."
1 Kings,16,7,"That message from the Lord against Baasha and his family was given by the prophet Jehu because of the sins that Baasha committed against the Lord . He aroused the Lord 's anger not only because of the evil he did, just as King Jeroboam had done before him, but also because he killed all of Jeroboam's family."
1 Kings,16,8,"In the twenty-sixth year of the reign of King Asa of Judah, Elah son of Baasha became king of Israel, and he ruled in Tirzah for two years."
1 Kings,16,9,"Zimri, one of his officers who was in charge of half of the king's chariots, plotted against him. One day in Tirzah, Elah was getting drunk in the home of Arza, who was in charge of the palace."
1 Kings,16,10,"Zimri entered the house, assassinated Elah, and succeeded him as king. This happened in the twenty-seventh year of the reign of King Asa of Judah."
1 Kings,16,11,As soon as Zimri became king he killed off all the members of Baasha's family. Every male relative and friend was put to death.
1 Kings,16,12,"And so, in accordance with what the Lord had said against Baasha through the prophet Jehu, Zimri killed all the family of Baasha."
1 Kings,16,13,"Because of their idolatry and because they led Israel into sin, Baasha and his son Elah had aroused the anger of the Lord , the God of Israel."
1 Kings,16,14,Everything else that Elah did is recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel.
1 Kings,16,15,"In the twenty-seventh year of the reign of King Asa of Judah, Zimri ruled in Tirzah over Israel for seven days. The Israelite troops were besieging the city of Gibbethon in Philistia,"
1 Kings,16,16,"and when they heard that Zimri had plotted against the king and assassinated him, then and there they all proclaimed their commander Omri king of Israel."
1 Kings,16,17,Omri and his troops left Gibbethon and went and besieged Tirzah.
1 Kings,16,18,"When Zimri saw that the city had fallen, he went into the palace's inner fortress, set the palace on fire, and died in the flames."
1 Kings,16,19,"This happened because of his sins against the Lord . Like his predecessor Jeroboam, he displeased the Lord by his own sins and by leading Israel into sin."
1 Kings,16,20,"Everything else that Zimri did, including the account of his conspiracy, is recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel."
1 Kings,16,21,"The people of Israel were divided: some of them wanted to make Tibni son of Ginath king, and the others were in favor of Omri."
1 Kings,16,22,"In the end, those in favor of Omri won out; Tibni died and Omri became king."
1 Kings,16,23,"So in the thirty-first year of the reign of King Asa of Judah, Omri became king of Israel, and he ruled for twelve years. The first six years he ruled in Tirzah,"
1 Kings,16,24,"and then he bought the hill of Samaria for six thousand pieces of silver from a man named Shemer. Omri fortified the hill, built a town there, and named it Samaria, after Shemer, the former owner of the hill."
1 Kings,16,25,Omri sinned against the Lord more than any of his predecessors.
1 Kings,16,26,"Like Jeroboam before him, he aroused the anger of the Lord , the God of Israel, by his sins and by leading the people into sin and idolatry."
1 Kings,16,27,Everything else that Omri did and all his accomplishments are recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel.
1 Kings,16,28,"Omri died and was buried in Samaria, and his son Ahab succeeded him as king."
1 Kings,16,29,"In the thirty-eighth year of the reign of King Asa of Judah, Ahab son of Omri became king of Israel, and he ruled in Samaria for twenty-two years."
1 Kings,16,30,He sinned against the Lord more than any of his predecessors.
1 Kings,16,31,"It was not enough for him to sin like King Jeroboam; he went further and married Jezebel, the daughter of King Ethbaal of Sidon, and worshiped Baal."
1 Kings,16,32,"He built a temple to Baal in Samaria, made an altar for him, and put it in the temple."
1 Kings,16,33,"He also put up an image of the goddess Asherah. He did more to arouse the anger of the Lord , the God of Israel, than all the kings of Israel before him."
1 Kings,16,34,"During his reign Hiel from Bethel rebuilt Jericho. As the Lord had foretold through Joshua son of Nun, Hiel lost his oldest son Abiram when he laid the foundation of Jericho, and his youngest son Segub when he built the gates."
1 Kings,17,1," A prophet named Elijah, from Tishbe in Gilead, said to King Ahab, “In the name of the Lord , the living God of Israel, whom I serve, I tell you that there will be no dew or rain for the next two or three years until I say so.”"
1 Kings,17,2,"Then the Lord said to Elijah,"
1 Kings,17,3,"“Leave this place and go east and hide yourself near Cherith Brook, east of the Jordan."
1 Kings,17,4,"The brook will supply you with water to drink, and I have commanded ravens to bring you food there.”"
1 Kings,17,5,"Elijah obeyed the Lord 's command, and went and stayed by Cherith Brook."
1 Kings,17,6,"He drank water from the brook, and ravens brought him bread and meat every morning and every evening."
1 Kings,17,7,After a while the brook dried up because of the lack of rain.
1 Kings,17,8,"Then the Lord said to Elijah,"
1 Kings,17,9,"“Now go to the town of Zarephath, near Sidon, and stay there. I have commanded a widow who lives there to feed you.”"
1 Kings,17,10,"So Elijah went to Zarephath, and as he came to the town gate, he saw a widow gathering firewood. “Please bring me a drink of water,” he said to her."
1 Kings,17,11,"And as she was going to get it, he called out, “And please bring me some bread, too.”"
1 Kings,17,12,"She answered, “By the living Lord your God I swear that I don't have any bread. All I have is a handful of flour in a bowl and a bit of olive oil in a jar. I came here to gather some firewood to take back home and prepare what little I have for my son and me. That will be our last meal, and then we will starve to death.”"
1 Kings,17,13,"“Don't worry,” Elijah said to her. “Go on and prepare your meal. But first make a small loaf from what you have and bring it to me, and then prepare the rest for you and your son."
1 Kings,17,14,"For this is what the Lord , the God of Israel, says: ‘The bowl will not run out of flour or the jar run out of oil before the day that I, the Lord , send rain.’”"
1 Kings,17,15,"The widow went and did as Elijah had told her, and all of them had enough food for many days."
1 Kings,17,16,"As the Lord had promised through Elijah, the bowl did not run out of flour nor did the jar run out of oil."
1 Kings,17,17,"Some time later the widow's son got sick; he got worse and worse, and finally he died."
1 Kings,17,18,"She said to Elijah, “Man of God, why did you do this to me? Did you come here to remind God of my sins and so cause my son's death?”"
1 Kings,17,19,"“Give the boy to me,” Elijah said. He took the boy from her arms, carried him upstairs to the room where he was staying, and laid him on the bed."
1 Kings,17,20,"Then he prayed aloud, “O Lord my God, why have you done such a terrible thing to this widow? She has been kind enough to take care of me, and now you kill her son!”"
1 Kings,17,21,"Then Elijah stretched himself out on the boy three times and prayed, “O Lord my God, restore this child to life!”"
1 Kings,17,22,The Lord answered Elijah's prayer; the child started breathing again and revived.
1 Kings,17,23,"Elijah took the boy back downstairs to his mother and said to her, “Look, your son is alive!”"
1 Kings,17,24,"She answered, “Now I know that you are a man of God and that the Lord really speaks through you!”"
1 Kings,18,1,"After some time, in the third year of the drought, the Lord said to Elijah, “Go and present yourself to King Ahab, and I will send rain.”"
1 Kings,18,2,"So Elijah started out. The famine in Samaria was at its worst,"
1 Kings,18,3,"so Ahab called in Obadiah, who was in charge of the palace. (Obadiah was a devout worshiper of the Lord,"
1 Kings,18,4,"and when Jezebel was killing the Lord 's prophets, Obadiah took a hundred of them, hid them in caves in two groups of fifty, and provided them with food and water.)"
1 Kings,18,5,"Ahab said to Obadiah, “Let us go and look at every spring and every stream bed in the land to see if we can find enough grass to keep the horses and mules alive. Maybe we won't have to kill any of our animals.”"
1 Kings,18,6,"They agreed on which part of the land each one would explore, and set off in different directions."
1 Kings,18,7,"As Obadiah was on his way, he suddenly met Elijah. He recognized him, bowed low before him, and asked, “Is it really you, sir?”"
1 Kings,18,8,"“Yes, I'm Elijah,” he answered. “Go and tell your master the king that I am here.”"
1 Kings,18,9,"Obadiah answered, “What have I done that you want to put me in danger of being killed by King Ahab?"
1 Kings,18,10,"By the living Lord , your God, I swear that the king has made a search for you in every country in the world. Whenever the ruler of a country reported that you were not in his country, Ahab would require that ruler to swear that you could not be found."
1 Kings,18,11,And now you want me to go and tell him that you are here?
1 Kings,18,12,"What if the spirit of the Lord carries you off to some unknown place as soon as I leave? Then, when I tell Ahab that you are here and he can't find you, he will put me to death. Remember that I have been a devout worshiper of the Lord ever since I was a boy."
1 Kings,18,13,"Haven't you heard that when Jezebel was killing the prophets of the Lord I hid a hundred of them in caves, in two groups of fifty, and supplied them with food and water?"
1 Kings,18,14,So how can you order me to go and tell the king that you are here? He will kill me!”
1 Kings,18,15,"Elijah answered, “By the living Lord Almighty, whom I serve, I promise that I will present myself to the king today.”"
1 Kings,18,16,"So Obadiah went to King Ahab and told him, and Ahab set off to meet Elijah."
1 Kings,18,17,"When Ahab saw him, he said, “So there you are—the worst troublemaker in Israel!”"
1 Kings,18,18,"“I'm not the troublemaker,” Elijah answered. “You are—you and your father. You are disobeying the Lord 's commands and worshiping the idols of Baal."
1 Kings,18,19,Now order all the people of Israel to meet me at Mount Carmel. Bring along the 450 prophets of Baal and the 400 prophets of the goddess Asherah who are supported by Queen Jezebel.”
1 Kings,18,20,So Ahab summoned all the Israelites and the prophets of Baal to meet at Mount Carmel.
1 Kings,18,21,"Elijah went up to the people and said, “How much longer will it take you to make up your minds? If the Lord is God, worship him; but if Baal is God, worship him!” But the people didn't say a word."
1 Kings,18,22,"Then Elijah said, “I am the only prophet of the Lord still left, but there are 450 prophets of Baal."
1 Kings,18,23,"Bring two bulls; let the prophets of Baal take one, kill it, cut it in pieces, and put it on the wood—but don't light the fire. I will do the same with the other bull."
1 Kings,18,24,"Then let the prophets of Baal pray to their god, and I will pray to the Lord , and the one who answers by sending fire—he is God.” The people shouted their approval."
1 Kings,18,25,"Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “Since there are so many of you, you take a bull and prepare it first. Pray to your god, but don't set fire to the wood.”"
1 Kings,18,26,"They took the bull that was brought to them, prepared it, and prayed to Baal until noon. They shouted, “Answer us, Baal!” and kept dancing around the altar they had built. But no answer came."
1 Kings,18,27,"At noon Elijah started making fun of them: “Pray louder! He is a god! Maybe he is day-dreaming or relieving himself, or perhaps he's gone off on a trip! Or maybe he's sleeping, and you've got to wake him up!”"
1 Kings,18,28,"So the prophets prayed louder and cut themselves with knives and daggers, according to their ritual, until blood flowed."
1 Kings,18,29,"They kept on ranting and raving until the middle of the afternoon; but no answer came, not a sound was heard."
1 Kings,18,30,"Then Elijah said to the people, “Come closer to me,” and they all gathered around him. He set about repairing the altar of the Lord which had been torn down."
1 Kings,18,31,"He took twelve stones, one for each of the twelve tribes named for the sons of Jacob, the man to whom the Lord had given the name Israel."
1 Kings,18,32,"With these stones he rebuilt the altar for the worship of the Lord . He dug a trench around it, large enough to hold about four gallons of water."
1 Kings,18,33,"Then he placed the wood on the altar, cut the bull in pieces, and laid it on the wood. He said, “Fill four jars with water and pour it on the offering and the wood.” They did so,"
1 Kings,18,34,"and he said, “Do it again”—and they did. “Do it once more,” he said—and they did."
1 Kings,18,35,The water ran down around the altar and filled the trench.
1 Kings,18,36,"At the hour of the afternoon sacrifice the prophet Elijah approached the altar and prayed, “O Lord , the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, prove now that you are the God of Israel and that I am your servant and have done all this at your command."
1 Kings,18,37,"Answer me, Lord , answer me, so that this people will know that you, the Lord , are God and that you are bringing them back to yourself.”"
1 Kings,18,38,"The Lord sent fire down, and it burned up the sacrifice, the wood, and the stones, scorched the earth and dried up the water in the trench."
1 Kings,18,39,"When the people saw this, they threw themselves on the ground and exclaimed, “The Lord is God; the Lord alone is God!”"
1 Kings,18,40,"Elijah ordered, “Seize the prophets of Baal; don't let any of them get away!” The people seized them all, and Elijah led them down to Kishon Brook and killed them."
1 Kings,18,41,"Then Elijah said to King Ahab, “Now, go and eat. I hear the roar of rain approaching.”"
1 Kings,18,42,"While Ahab went to eat, Elijah climbed to the top of Mount Carmel, where he bowed down to the ground, with his head between his knees."
1 Kings,18,43,"He said to his servant, “Go and look toward the sea.” The servant went and returned, saying, “I didn't see a thing.” Seven times in all Elijah told him to go and look."
1 Kings,18,44,"The seventh time he returned and said, “I saw a little cloud no bigger than a man's hand, coming up from the sea.” Elijah ordered his servant, “Go to King Ahab and tell him to get in his chariot and go back home before the rain stops him.”"
1 Kings,18,45,"In a little while the sky was covered with dark clouds, the wind began to blow, and a heavy rain began to fall. Ahab got in his chariot and started back to Jezreel."
1 Kings,18,46,The power of the Lord came on Elijah; he fastened his clothes tight around his waist and ran ahead of Ahab all the way to Jezreel.
1 Kings,19,1,King Ahab told his wife Jezebel everything that Elijah had done and how he had put all the prophets of Baal to death.
1 Kings,19,2,She sent a message to Elijah: “May the gods strike me dead if by this time tomorrow I don't do the same thing to you that you did to the prophets.”
1 Kings,19,3,"Elijah was afraid and fled for his life; he took his servant and went to Beersheba in Judah. Leaving the servant there,"
1 Kings,19,4,"Elijah walked a whole day into the wilderness. He stopped and sat down in the shade of a tree and wished he would die. “It's too much, Lord ,” he prayed. “Take away my life; I might as well be dead!”"
1 Kings,19,5,"He lay down under the tree and fell asleep. Suddenly an angel touched him and said, “Wake up and eat.”"
1 Kings,19,6,"He looked around and saw a loaf of bread and a jar of water near his head. He ate and drank, and lay down again."
1 Kings,19,7,"The Lord 's angel returned and woke him up a second time, saying, “Get up and eat, or the trip will be too much for you.”"
1 Kings,19,8,"Elijah got up, ate and drank, and the food gave him enough strength to walk forty days to Sinai, the holy mountain."
1 Kings,19,9,"There he went into a cave to spend the night. Suddenly the Lord spoke to him, “Elijah, what are you doing here?”"
1 Kings,19,10," He answered, “ Lord God Almighty, I have always served you—you alone. But the people of Israel have broken their covenant with you, torn down your altars, and killed all your prophets. I am the only one left—and they are trying to kill me!”"
1 Kings,19,11,"“Go out and stand before me on top of the mountain,” the Lord said to him. Then the Lord passed by and sent a furious wind that split the hills and shattered the rocks—but the Lord was not in the wind. The wind stopped blowing, and then there was an earthquake—but the Lord was not in the earthquake."
1 Kings,19,12,After the earthquake there was a fire—but the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire there was the soft whisper of a voice.
1 Kings,19,13,"When Elijah heard it, he covered his face with his cloak and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. A voice said to him, “Elijah, what are you doing here?”"
1 Kings,19,14,"He answered, “ Lord God Almighty, I have always served you—you alone. But the people of Israel have broken their covenant with you, torn down your altars, and killed all your prophets. I am the only one left—and they are trying to kill me.”"
1 Kings,19,15," The Lord said, “Return to the wilderness near Damascus, then enter the city and anoint Hazael as king of Syria;"
1 Kings,19,16,"anoint Jehu son of Nimshi as king of Israel, and anoint Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel Meholah to succeed you as prophet."
1 Kings,19,17,"Anyone who escapes being put to death by Hazael will be killed by Jehu, and anyone who escapes Jehu will be killed by Elisha."
1 Kings,19,18,Yet I will leave seven thousand people alive in Israel—all those who are loyal to me and have not bowed to Baal or kissed his idol.”
1 Kings,19,19,"Elijah left and found Elisha plowing with a team of oxen; there were eleven teams ahead of him, and he was plowing with the last one. Elijah took off his cloak and put it on Elisha."
1 Kings,19,20,"Elisha then left his oxen, ran after Elijah, and said, “Let me kiss my father and mother good-bye, and then I will go with you.” Elijah answered, “All right, go back. I'm not stopping you!”"
1 Kings,19,21,"Then Elisha went to his team of oxen, killed them, and cooked the meat, using the yoke as fuel for the fire. He gave the meat to the people, and they ate it. Then he went and followed Elijah as his helper."
1 Kings,20,1,"King Benhadad of Syria gathered all his troops, and supported by thirty-two other rulers with their horses and chariots, he marched up, laid siege to Samaria, and launched attacks against it."
1 Kings,20,2,"He sent messengers into the city to King Ahab of Israel to say, “King Benhadad demands that"
1 Kings,20,3,"you surrender to him your silver and gold, your women and the strongest of your children.”"
1 Kings,20,4,"“Tell my lord, King Benhadad, that I agree; he can have me and everything I own,” Ahab answered."
1 Kings,20,5,"Later the messengers came back to Ahab with another demand from Benhadad: “I sent you word that you were to hand over to me your silver and gold, your women and your children."
1 Kings,20,6,"Now, however, I will send my officers to search your palace and the homes of your officials, and to take everything they consider valuable. They will be there about this time tomorrow.”"
1 Kings,20,7,"King Ahab called in all the leaders of the country and said, “You see that this man wants to ruin us. He sent me a message demanding my wives and children, my silver and gold, and I agreed.”"
1 Kings,20,8,"The leaders and the people answered, “Don't pay any attention to him; don't give in.”"
1 Kings,20,9,"So Ahab replied to Benhadad's messengers, “Tell my lord the king that I agreed to his first demand, but I cannot agree to the second.” The messengers left and then returned with another message"
1 Kings,20,10,from Benhadad: “I will bring enough men to destroy this city of yours and carry off the rubble in their hands. May the gods strike me dead if I don't!”
1 Kings,20,11,"King Ahab answered, “Tell King Benhadad that a real soldier does his bragging after a battle, not before it.”"
1 Kings,20,12,"Benhadad received Ahab's answer as he and his allies, the other rulers, were drinking in their tents. He ordered his men to get ready to attack the city, and so they moved into position."
1 Kings,20,13,"Meanwhile, a prophet went to King Ahab and said, “The Lord says, ‘Don't be afraid of that huge army! I will give you victory over it today, and you will know that I am the Lord .’”"
1 Kings,20,14,"“Who will lead the attack?” Ahab asked. The prophet answered, “The Lord says that the young soldiers under the command of the district governors are to do it.” “Who will command the main force?” the king asked. “You,” the prophet answered."
1 Kings,20,15,"So the king called out the young soldiers who were under the district commanders, 232 in all. Then he called out the Israelite army, a total of seven thousand men."
1 Kings,20,16,"The attack began at noon, as Benhadad and his thirty-two allies were getting drunk in their tents."
1 Kings,20,17,The young soldiers advanced first. Scouts sent out by Benhadad reported to him that a group of soldiers was coming out of Samaria.
1 Kings,20,18,"He ordered, “Take them alive, no matter whether they are coming to fight or to ask for peace.”"
1 Kings,20,19,"The young soldiers led the attack, followed by the Israelite army,"
1 Kings,20,20,"and each one killed the man he fought. The Syrians fled, with the Israelites in hot pursuit, but Benhadad escaped on horseback, accompanied by some of the cavalry."
1 Kings,20,21,"King Ahab took to the field, captured the horses and chariots, and inflicted a severe defeat on the Syrians."
1 Kings,20,22,"Then the prophet went to King Ahab and said, “Go back and build up your forces and make careful plans, because the king of Syria will attack again next spring.”"
1 Kings,20,23,"King Benhadad's officials said to him, “The gods of Israel are mountain gods, and that is why the Israelites defeated us. But we will certainly defeat them if we fight them in the plains."
1 Kings,20,24,"Now, remove the thirty-two rulers from their commands and replace them with field commanders."
1 Kings,20,25,"Then call up an army as large as the one that deserted you, with the same number of horses and chariots. We will fight the Israelites in the plains, and this time we will defeat them.” King Benhadad agreed and followed their advice."
1 Kings,20,26,The following spring he called up his men and marched with them to the city of Aphek to attack the Israelites.
1 Kings,20,27,"The Israelites were called up and equipped; they marched out and camped in two groups facing the Syrians. The Israelites looked like two small flocks of goats compared to the Syrians, who spread out over the countryside."
1 Kings,20,28,"A prophet went to King Ahab and said, “This is what the Lord says: ‘Because the Syrians say that I am a god of the hills and not of the plains, I will give you victory over their huge army, and you and your people will know that I am the Lord .’”"
1 Kings,20,29,"For seven days the Syrians and the Israelites stayed in their camps, facing each other. On the seventh day they started fighting, and the Israelites killed a hundred thousand Syrians."
1 Kings,20,30,"The survivors fled into the city of Aphek, where the city walls fell on twenty-seven thousand of them. Benhadad also escaped into the city and took refuge in the back room of a house."
1 Kings,20,31,"His officials went to him and said, “We have heard that the Israelite kings are merciful. Give us permission to go to the king of Israel with sackcloth around our waists and ropes around our necks, and maybe he will spare your life.”"
1 Kings,20,32,"So they wrapped sackcloth around their waists and ropes around their necks, went to Ahab and said, “Your servant Benhadad pleads with you for his life.” Ahab answered, “Is he still alive? Good! He's like a brother to me!”"
1 Kings,20,33,"Benhadad's officials were watching for a good sign, and when Ahab said “brother,” they took it up at once, and said, “As you say, Benhadad is your brother!” “Bring him to me,” Ahab ordered. When Benhadad arrived, Ahab invited him to get in the chariot with him."
1 Kings,20,34,"Benhadad said to him, “I will restore to you the towns my father took from your father, and you may set up a commercial center for yourself in Damascus, just as my father did in Samaria.” Ahab replied, “On these terms, then, I will set you free.” He made a treaty with him and let him go."
1 Kings,20,35,"At the Lord 's command a member of a group of prophets ordered a fellow prophet to hit him. But he refused,"
1 Kings,20,36,"so he said to him, “Because you have disobeyed the Lord 's command, a lion will kill you as soon as you leave me.” And as soon as he left, a lion came along and killed him."
1 Kings,20,37,"Then this same prophet went to another man and said, “Hit me!” This man did so; he hit him a hard blow and hurt him."
1 Kings,20,38,"The prophet bandaged his face with a cloth, to disguise himself, and went and stood by the road, waiting for the king of Israel to pass."
1 Kings,20,39,"As the king was passing by, the prophet called out to him and said, “Your Majesty, I was fighting in the battle when a soldier brought a captured enemy to me and said, ‘Guard this man; if he escapes, you will pay for it with your life or else pay a fine of three thousand pieces of silver.’"
1 Kings,20,40,"But I got busy with other things, and the man escaped.” The king answered, “You have pronounced your own sentence, and you will have to pay the penalty.”"
1 Kings,20,41,"The prophet tore the cloth from his face, and at once the king recognized him as one of the prophets."
1 Kings,20,42,"The prophet then said to the king, “This is the word of the Lord : ‘Because you allowed the man to escape whom I had ordered to be killed, you will pay for it with your life, and your army will be destroyed for letting his army escape.’”"
1 Kings,20,43,"The king went back home to Samaria, worried and depressed."
1 Kings,21,1,Near King Ahab's palace in Jezreel there was a vineyard owned by a man named Naboth.
1 Kings,21,2,"One day Ahab said to Naboth, “Let me have your vineyard; it is close to my palace, and I want to use the land for a vegetable garden. I will give you a better vineyard for it or, if you prefer, I will pay you a fair price.”"
1 Kings,21,3,"“I inherited this vineyard from my ancestors,” Naboth replied. “The Lord forbid that I should let you have it!”"
1 Kings,21,4,"Ahab went home, depressed and angry over what Naboth had said to him. He lay down on his bed, facing the wall, and would not eat."
1 Kings,21,5,"His wife Jezebel went to him and asked, “Why are you so depressed? Why won't you eat?”"
1 Kings,21,6,"He answered, “Because of what Naboth said to me. I offered to buy his vineyard or, if he preferred, to give him another one for it, but he told me that I couldn't have it!”"
1 Kings,21,7,"“Well, are you the king or aren't you?” Jezebel replied. “Get out of bed, cheer up, and eat. I will get you Naboth's vineyard!”"
1 Kings,21,8,"Then she wrote some letters, signed Ahab's name to them, sealed them with his seal, and sent them to the officials and leading citizens of Jezreel."
1 Kings,21,9,"The letters said: “Proclaim a day of fasting, call the people together, and give Naboth the place of honor."
1 Kings,21,10,Get a couple of scoundrels to accuse him to his face of cursing God and the king. Then take him out of the city and stone him to death.”
1 Kings,21,11,The officials and leading citizens of Jezreel did what Jezebel had commanded.
1 Kings,21,12,"They proclaimed a day of fasting, called the people together, and gave Naboth the place of honor."
1 Kings,21,13,"The two scoundrels publicly accused him of cursing God and the king, and so he was taken outside the city and stoned to death."
1 Kings,21,14,The message was sent to Jezebel: “Naboth has been put to death.”
1 Kings,21,15,"As soon as Jezebel received the message, she said to Ahab, “Naboth is dead. Now go and take possession of the vineyard which he refused to sell to you.”"
1 Kings,21,16,At once Ahab went to the vineyard to take possession of it.
1 Kings,21,17,"Then the Lord said to Elijah, the prophet from Tishbe,"
1 Kings,21,18,"“Go to King Ahab of Samaria. You will find him in Naboth's vineyard, about to take possession of it."
1 Kings,21,19,"Tell him that I, the Lord , say to him, ‘After murdering the man, are you taking over his property as well?’ Tell him that this is what I say: ‘In the very place that the dogs licked up Naboth's blood they will lick up your blood!’”"
1 Kings,21,20,"When Ahab saw Elijah, he said, “Have you caught up with me, my enemy?” “Yes, I have,” Elijah answered. “You have devoted yourself completely to doing what is wrong in the Lord 's sight."
1 Kings,21,21,"So the Lord says to you, ‘I will bring disaster on you. I will do away with you and get rid of every male in your family, young and old alike."
1 Kings,21,22,"Your family will become like the family of King Jeroboam son of Nebat and like the family of King Baasha son of Ahijah, because you have stirred up my anger by leading Israel into sin.’"
1 Kings,21,23,"And concerning Jezebel, the Lord says that dogs will eat her body in the city of Jezreel."
1 Kings,21,24,"Any of your relatives who die in the city will be eaten by dogs, and any who die in the open country will be eaten by vultures.”("
1 Kings,21,25,There was no one else who had devoted himself so completely to doing wrong in the Lord 's sight as Ahab—all at the urging of his wife Jezebel.
1 Kings,21,26,"He committed the most shameful sins by worshiping idols, as the Amorites had done, whom the Lord had driven out of the land as the people of Israel advanced.)"
1 Kings,21,27,"When Elijah finished speaking, Ahab tore his clothes, took them off, and put on sackcloth. He refused food, slept in the sackcloth, and went about gloomy and depressed."
1 Kings,21,28,"The Lord said to the prophet Elijah,"
1 Kings,21,29,"“Have you noticed how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Since he has done this, I will not bring disaster on him during his lifetime; it will be during his son's lifetime that I will bring disaster on Ahab's family.”"
1 Kings,22,1,"There was peace between Israel and Syria for the next two years,"
1 Kings,22,2,but in the third year King Jehoshaphat of Judah went to see King Ahab of Israel.
1 Kings,22,3,"Ahab asked his officials, “Why is it that we have not done anything to get back Ramoth in Gilead from the king of Syria? It belongs to us!”"
1 Kings,22,4,"And Ahab asked Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me to attack Ramoth?” “I am ready when you are,” Jehoshaphat answered, “and so are my soldiers and my cavalry."
1 Kings,22,5,But first let's consult the Lord .”
1 Kings,22,6,"So Ahab called in the prophets, about four hundred of them, and asked them, “Should I go and attack Ramoth, or not?” “Attack it,” they answered. “The Lord will give you victory.”"
1 Kings,22,7,"But Jehoshaphat asked, “Isn't there another prophet through whom we can consult the Lord ?”"
1 Kings,22,8,"Ahab answered, “There is one more, Micaiah son of Imlah. But I hate him because he never prophesies anything good for me; it's always something bad.” “You shouldn't say that!” Jehoshaphat replied."
1 Kings,22,9,Then Ahab called in a court official and told him to go and get Micaiah at once.
1 Kings,22,10,"The two kings, dressed in their royal robes, were sitting on their thrones at the threshing place just outside the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets were prophesying in front of them."
1 Kings,22,11,"One of them, Zedekiah son of Chenaanah, made iron horns and said to Ahab, “This is what the Lord says: ‘With these you will fight the Syrians and totally defeat them.’”"
1 Kings,22,12,"All the other prophets said the same thing. “March against Ramoth and you will win,” they said. “The Lord will give you victory.”"
1 Kings,22,13,"Meanwhile, the official who had gone to get Micaiah said to him, “All the other prophets have prophesied success for the king, and you had better do the same.”"
1 Kings,22,14,"But Micaiah answered, “By the living Lord I promise that I will say what he tells me to!”"
1 Kings,22,15,"When he appeared before King Ahab, the king asked him, “Micaiah, should King Jehoshaphat and I go and attack Ramoth, or not?” “Attack!” Micaiah answered. “Of course you'll win. The Lord will give you victory.”"
1 Kings,22,16,"But Ahab replied, “When you speak to me in the name of the Lord , tell the truth! How many times do I have to tell you that?”"
1 Kings,22,17," Micaiah answered, “I can see the army of Israel scattered over the hills like sheep without a shepherd. And the Lord said, ‘These men have no leader; let them go home in peace.’”"
1 Kings,22,18,"Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “Didn't I tell you that he never prophesies anything good for me? It's always something bad!”"
1 Kings,22,19," Micaiah went on: “Now listen to what the Lord says! I saw the Lord sitting on his throne in heaven, with all his angels standing beside him."
1 Kings,22,20,"The Lord asked, ‘Who will deceive Ahab so that he will go and be killed at Ramoth?’ Some of the angels said one thing, and others said something else,"
1 Kings,22,21,"until a spirit stepped forward, approached the Lord , and said, ‘I will deceive him.’"
1 Kings,22,22,"‘How?’ the Lord asked. The spirit replied, ‘I will go and make all of Ahab's prophets tell lies.’ The Lord said, ‘Go and deceive him. You will succeed.’”"
1 Kings,22,23,And Micaiah concluded: “This is what has happened. The Lord has made these prophets of yours lie to you. But he himself has decreed that you will meet with disaster!”
1 Kings,22,24,"Then the prophet Zedekiah went up to Micaiah, slapped his face, and asked, “Since when did the Lord 's spirit leave me and speak to you?”"
1 Kings,22,25,"“You will find out when you go into some back room to hide,” Micaiah replied."
1 Kings,22,26,"Then King Ahab ordered one of his officers, “Arrest Micaiah and take him to Amon, the governor of the city, and to Prince Joash."
1 Kings,22,27,Tell them to throw him in prison and to put him on bread and water until I return safely.”
1 Kings,22,28,"“If you return safely,” Micaiah exclaimed, “then the Lord has not spoken through me!” And he added, “Listen, everyone, to what I have said!”"
1 Kings,22,29,Then King Ahab of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah went to attack the city of Ramoth in Gilead.
1 Kings,22,30,"Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “As we go into battle, I will disguise myself, but you wear your royal garments.” So the king of Israel went into battle in disguise."
1 Kings,22,31,The king of Syria had ordered his thirty-two chariot commanders to attack no one else except the king of Israel.
1 Kings,22,32,"So when they saw King Jehoshaphat, they all thought that he was the king of Israel, and they turned to attack him. But when he cried out,"
1 Kings,22,33,"they realized that he was not the king of Israel, and they stopped their attack."
1 Kings,22,34,"By chance, however, a Syrian soldier shot an arrow which struck King Ahab between the joints of his armor. “I'm wounded!” he cried out to his chariot driver. “Turn around and pull out of the battle!”"
1 Kings,22,35,"While the battle raged on, King Ahab remained propped up in his chariot, facing the Syrians. The blood from his wound ran down and covered the bottom of the chariot, and at evening he died."
1 Kings,22,36,Near sunset the order went out through the Israelite ranks: “Each of you go back to your own country and city!”
1 Kings,22,37,So died King Ahab. His body was taken to Samaria and buried.
1 Kings,22,38,"His chariot was cleaned up at the pool of Samaria, where dogs licked up his blood and prostitutes washed themselves, as the Lord had said would happen."
1 Kings,22,39,"Everything else that King Ahab did, including an account of his palace decorated with ivory and of all the cities he built, is recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel."
1 Kings,22,40,At his death his son Ahaziah succeeded him as king.
1 Kings,22,41,"In the fourth year of the reign of King Ahab of Israel, Jehoshaphat son of Asa became king of Judah"
1 Kings,22,42,"at the age of thirty-five, and he ruled in Jerusalem for twenty-five years. His mother was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi."
1 Kings,22,43,"Like his father Asa before him, he did what was right in the sight of the Lord ; but the places of worship were not destroyed, and the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there."
1 Kings,22,44,Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.
1 Kings,22,45,"Everything else that Jehoshaphat did, all his bravery and his battles, are recorded in The History of the Kings of Judah."
1 Kings,22,46,He got rid of all the male and female prostitutes serving at the pagan altars who were still left from the days of his father Asa.
1 Kings,22,47,The land of Edom had no king; it was ruled by a deputy appointed by the king of Judah.
1 Kings,22,48,King Jehoshaphat had ocean-going ships built to sail to the land of Ophir for gold; but they were wrecked at Eziongeber and never sailed.
1 Kings,22,49,"Then King Ahaziah of Israel offered to let his men sail with Jehoshaphat's men, but Jehoshaphat refused the offer."
1 Kings,22,50,"Jehoshaphat died and was buried in the royal tombs in David's City, and his son Jehoram succeeded him as king."
1 Kings,22,51,"In the seventeenth year of the reign of King Jehoshaphat of Judah, Ahaziah son of Ahab became king of Israel, and he ruled in Samaria for two years."
1 Kings,22,52,"He sinned against the Lord , following the wicked example of his father Ahab, his mother Jezebel, and King Jeroboam, who had led Israel into sin."
1 Kings,22,53,"He worshiped and served Baal, and like his father before him, he aroused the anger of the Lord , the God of Israel."
