1 Chronicles,14,8,"When the Philistines heard that David had now been made king over the whole country of Israel, their army went out to capture him. So David marched out to meet them."
1 Chronicles,14,9,The Philistines arrived at Rephaim Valley and began plundering.
1 Chronicles,14,10,"David asked God, “Shall I attack the Philistines? Will you give me the victory?” The Lord answered, “Yes, attack! I will give you the victory!”"
1 Chronicles,14,11,"So David attacked them at Baal Perazim and defeated them. He said, “God has used me to break through the enemy army like a flood.” So that place is called Baal Perazim."
1 Chronicles,14,12,"When the Philistines fled, they left their idols behind, and David gave orders for them to be burned."
1 Chronicles,14,13,Soon the Philistines returned to the valley and started plundering it again.
1 Chronicles,14,14,"Once more David consulted God, who answered, “Don't attack them from here, but go around and get ready to attack them from the other side, near the balsam trees."
1 Chronicles,14,15,"When you hear the sound of marching in the treetops, then attack, because I will be marching ahead of you to defeat the Philistine army.”"
1 Chronicles,14,16,"David did what God had commanded, and so he drove the Philistines back from Gibeon all the way to Gezer."
1 Chronicles,14,17,"David's fame spread everywhere, and the Lord made every nation afraid of him."
1 Chronicles,15,1,"For his own use, David built houses in David's City. He also prepared a place for God's Covenant Box and put up a tent for it."
1 Chronicles,15,2,"Then he said, “Only Levites should carry the Covenant Box, because they are the ones the Lord chose to carry it and to serve him forever.”"
1 Chronicles,15,3,So David summoned all the people of Israel to Jerusalem in order to bring the Covenant Box to the place he had prepared for it.
1 Chronicles,15,4,Next he sent for the descendants of Aaron and for the Levites.
1 Chronicles,15,5,"From the Levite clan of Kohath came Uriel, in charge of 120 members of his clan;"
1 Chronicles,15,6,"from the clan of Merari came Asaiah, in charge of 220;"
1 Chronicles,15,7,"from the clan of Gershon, Joel, in charge of 130;"
1 Chronicles,15,8,"from the clan of Elizaphan, Shemaiah, in charge of 200;"
1 Chronicles,15,9,"from the clan of Hebron, Eliel, in charge of 80;"
1 Chronicles,15,10,"and from the clan of Uzziel, Amminadab, in charge of 112."
1 Chronicles,15,11,"David called in the priests Zadok and Abiathar and the six Levites, Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab."
1 Chronicles,15,12,"He said to the Levites, “You are the leaders of the Levite clans. Purify yourselves and your fellow Levites, so that you can bring the Covenant Box of the Lord God of Israel to the place I have prepared for it."
1 Chronicles,15,13,"Because you were not there to carry it the first time, the Lord our God punished us for not worshiping him as we should have done.”"
1 Chronicles,15,14,Then the priests and the Levites purified themselves in order to move the Covenant Box of the Lord God of Israel.
1 Chronicles,15,15,"The Levites carried it on poles on their shoulders, as the Lord had commanded through Moses."
1 Chronicles,15,16,David commanded the leaders of the Levites to assign various Levites to sing and to play joyful music on harps and cymbals.
1 Chronicles,16,1,They took the Covenant Box to the tent which David had prepared for it and put it inside. Then they offered sacrifices and fellowship offerings to God.
1 Chronicles,16,2,"After David had finished offering the sacrifices, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord"
1 Chronicles,16,3,"and distributed food to them all. He gave each man and woman in Israel a loaf of bread, a piece of roasted meat, and some raisins."
1 Chronicles,16,4,"David appointed some of the Levites to lead the worship of the Lord , the God of Israel, in front of the Covenant Box, by singing and praising him."
1 Chronicles,16,5,"Asaph was appointed leader, with Zechariah as his assistant. Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed Edom, and Jeiel were to play harps. Asaph was to sound the cymbals,"
1 Chronicles,16,6,"and two priests, Benaiah and Jahaziel, were to blow trumpets regularly in front of the Covenant Box."
1 Chronicles,16,7,It was then that David first gave Asaph and the other Levites the responsibility for singing praises to the Lord.
1 Chronicles,16,8,"Give thanks to the Lord , proclaim his greatness; tell the nations what he has done."
1 Chronicles,16,9,Sing praise to the Lord; tell the wonderful things he has done.
1 Chronicles,16,10,Be glad that we belong to him; let all who worship him rejoice!
1 Chronicles,16,11,"Go to the Lord for help, and worship him continually."
1 Chronicles,17,1,"King David was now living in his palace. One day he sent for the prophet Nathan and said to him, “Here I am living in a house built of cedar, but the Lord 's Covenant Box is kept in a tent!”"
1 Chronicles,17,2,"Nathan answered, “Do whatever you have in mind, because God is with you.”"
1 Chronicles,17,3,"But that night God said to Nathan,"
1 Chronicles,17,4,"“Go and tell my servant David that I say to him, ‘You are not the one to build a temple for me to live in."
1 Chronicles,17,5,From the time I rescued the people of Israel from Egypt until now I have never lived in a temple; I have always lived in tents and moved from place to place.
1 Chronicles,17,6,In all my traveling with the people of Israel I never asked any of the leaders that I appointed why they had not built me a temple made of cedar.’
1 Chronicles,17,7,"“So tell my servant David that I, the Lord Almighty, say to him, ‘I took you from looking after sheep in the fields and made you the ruler of my people Israel."
1 Chronicles,17,8,"I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have defeated all your enemies as you advanced. I will make you as famous as the greatest leaders in the world."
1 Chronicles,18,1,Some time later King David attacked the Philistines again and defeated them. He took out of their control the city of Gath and its surrounding villages.
1 Chronicles,18,2,"He also defeated the Moabites, who became his subjects and paid taxes to him."
1 Chronicles,18,3,"Next, David attacked King Hadadezer of the Syrian state of Zobah, near the territory of Hamath, because Hadadezer was trying to gain control of the territory by the upper Euphrates River."
1 Chronicles,18,4,"David captured a thousand of his chariots, seven thousand cavalry troops, and twenty thousand foot soldiers. He kept enough horses for a hundred chariots and crippled all the rest."
1 Chronicles,18,5,"When the Syrians of Damascus sent an army to help King Hadadezer, David attacked it and killed twenty-two thousand men."
1 Chronicles,18,6,"Then he set up military camps in their territory, and they became his subjects and paid taxes to him. The Lord made David victorious everywhere."
1 Chronicles,18,7,David captured the gold shields carried by Hadadezer's officials and took them to Jerusalem.
1 Chronicles,18,8,"He also took a great quantity of bronze from Tibhath and Kun, cities ruled by Hadadezer. (Solomon later used this bronze to make the tank, the columns, and the bronze utensils for the Temple.)"
1 Chronicles,18,9,King Toi of Hamath heard that David had defeated Hadadezer's entire army.
1 Chronicles,18,10,"So he sent his son Joram to greet King David and congratulate him for his victory over Hadadezer, against whom Toi had fought many times. Joram brought David presents made of gold, silver, and bronze."
1 Chronicles,18,11,"King David dedicated them for use in worship, along with the silver and gold he took from the nations he conquered—Edom, Moab, Ammon, Philistia, and Amalek."
1 Chronicles,18,12," Abishai, whose mother was Zeruiah, defeated the Edomites in Salt Valley and killed eighteen thousand of them."
1 Chronicles,18,13,"He set up military camps throughout Edom, and the people there became King David's subjects. The Lord made David victorious everywhere."

1 Chronicles,18,17,Benaiah son of Jehoiada was in charge of David's bodyguards; and King David's sons held high positions in his service.
1 Chronicles,19,1,"Some time later King Nahash of Ammon died, and his son Hanun became king."
1 Chronicles,19,2,"King David said, “I must show loyal friendship to Hanun, as his father Nahash did to me.” So David sent messengers to express his sympathy. When they arrived in Ammon and called on King Hanun,"
1 Chronicles,19,3,"the Ammonite leaders said to the king, “Do you think that it is in your father's honor that David has sent these men to express sympathy to you? Of course not! He has sent them here as spies to explore the land, so that he can conquer it!”"
1 Chronicles,19,4,"Hanun seized David's messengers, shaved off their beards, cut off their clothes at the hips, and sent them away."
1 Chronicles,19,5,"They were too ashamed to return home. When David heard what had happened, he sent word for them to stay in Jericho and not return until their beards had grown again."
1 Chronicles,19,6,"King Hanun and the Ammonites realized that they had made David their enemy, so they paid nearly forty tons of silver to hire chariots and charioteers from Upper Mesopotamia and from the Syrian states of Maacah and Zobah."
1 Chronicles,19,7,The thirty-two thousand chariots they hired and the army of the king of Maacah came and camped near Medeba. The Ammonites too came out from all their cities and got ready to fight.
1 Chronicles,19,8,"When David heard what was happening, he sent out Joab and the whole army."
1 Chronicles,19,9,"The Ammonites marched out and took up their position at the entrance to Rabbah, their capital city, and the kings who had come to help took up their position in the open countryside."
1 Chronicles,19,10,"Joab saw that the enemy troops would attack him in front and from the rear, so he chose the best of Israel's soldiers and put them in position facing the Syrians."
1 Chronicles,19,11,"He placed the rest of his troops under the command of his brother Abishai, who put them in position facing the Ammonites."
1 Chronicles,19,12,"Joab said to him, “If you see that the Syrians are defeating me, come and help me, and if the Ammonites are defeating you, I will go and help you."
1 Chronicles,19,13,Be strong and courageous! Let's fight hard for our people and for the cities of our God. And may the Lord 's will be done.”
1 Chronicles,19,14,"Joab and his men advanced to attack, and the Syrians fled."
1 Chronicles,19,15,"When the Ammonites saw the Syrians running away, they fled from Abishai and retreated into the city. Then Joab went back to Jerusalem."
1 Chronicles,19,16,"The Syrians realized that they had been defeated by the Israelites, so they brought troops from the Syrian states on the east side of the Euphrates River and placed them under the command of Shobach, commander of the army of King Hadadezer of Zobah."
1 Chronicles,19,17,"When David heard of it, he gathered the Israelite troops, crossed the Jordan River, and put them in position facing the Syrians. The fighting began,"
1 Chronicles,19,18,"and the Israelites drove the Syrian army back. David and his men killed seven thousand Syrian chariot drivers and forty thousand foot soldiers. They also killed the Syrian commander, Shobach."
1 Chronicles,19,19,"When the kings who were subject to Hadadezer realized that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and became his subjects. The Syrians were never again willing to help the Ammonites."
1 Chronicles,20,1," The following spring, at the time of the year when kings usually go to war, Joab led out the army and invaded the land of Ammon; King David, however, stayed in Jerusalem. They besieged the city of Rabbah, attacked it, and destroyed it."
1 Chronicles,20,2,"The Ammonite idol Molech had a gold crown which weighed about seventy-five pounds. In it there was a jewel, which David took and put in his own crown. He also took a large amount of loot from the city."
1 Chronicles,20,3,"He took the people of the city and put them to work with saws, iron hoes, and axes. He did the same to the people of all the other towns of Ammon. Then he and his men returned to Jerusalem."
1 Chronicles,20,4,"Later on, war broke out again with the Philistines at Gezer. This was when Sibbecai from Hushah killed a giant named Sippai, and the Philistines were defeated."
1 Chronicles,20,5," There was another battle with the Philistines, and Elhanan son of Jair killed Lahmi, the brother of Goliath from Gath, whose spear had a shaft as thick as the bar on a weaver's loom."
1 Chronicles,20,6,"Another battle took place at Gath, where there was a giant with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot. He was a descendant of the ancient giants."
1 Chronicles,20,7,"He defied the Israelites, and Jonathan, the son of David's brother Shammah, killed him."
1 Chronicles,20,8,"These three, who were killed by David and his men, were descendants of the giants at Gath."
1 Chronicles,21,1,"Satan wanted to bring trouble on the people of Israel, so he made David decide to take a census."
1 Chronicles,21,2,"David gave orders to Joab and the other officers, “Go through Israel, from one end of the country to the other, and count the people. I want to know how many there are.”"
1 Chronicles,21,3,"Joab answered, “May the Lord make the people of Israel a hundred times more numerous than they are now! Your Majesty, they are all your servants. Why do you want to do this and make the whole nation guilty?”"
1 Chronicles,21,4,"But the king made Joab obey the order. Joab went out, traveled through the whole country of Israel, and then returned to Jerusalem."
1 Chronicles,21,5,"He reported to King David the total number of men capable of military service: 1,100,000 in Israel and 470,000 in Judah."
1 Chronicles,21,6,"Because Joab disapproved of the king's command, he did not take any census of the tribes of Levi and Benjamin."
1 Chronicles,21,7,"God was displeased with what had been done, so he punished Israel."
1 Chronicles,21,8,"David said to God, “I have committed a terrible sin in doing this! Please forgive me. I have acted foolishly.”"
1 Chronicles,21,9,"Then the Lord said to Gad, David's prophet,"
1 Chronicles,21,10,“Go and tell David that I am giving him three choices. I will do whichever he chooses.”
1 Chronicles,21,11,"Gad went to David, told him what the Lord had said, and asked, “Which is it to be?"
1 Chronicles,21,12,"Three years of famine? Or three months of running away from the armies of your enemies? Or three days during which the Lord attacks you with his sword and sends an epidemic on your land, using his angel to bring death throughout Israel? What answer shall I give the Lord ?”"
1 Chronicles,21,13,"David replied to Gad, “I am in a desperate situation! But I don't want to be punished by people. Let the Lord himself be the one to punish me, because he is merciful.”"
1 Chronicles,21,14,"So the Lord sent an epidemic on the people of Israel, and seventy thousand of them died."
1 Chronicles,21,15,"Then he sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem, but he changed his mind and said to the angel, “Stop! That's enough!” The angel was standing by the threshing place of Araunah, a Jebusite."
1 Chronicles,21,16,"David saw the angel standing in midair, holding his sword in his hand, ready to destroy Jerusalem. Then David and the leaders of the people—all of whom were wearing sackcloth—bowed low, with their faces touching the ground."
1 Chronicles,21,17,"David prayed, “O God, I am the one who did wrong. I am the one who ordered the census. What have these poor people done? Lord , my God, punish me and my family, and spare your people.”"
1 Chronicles,21,18,The angel of the Lord told Gad to command David to go and build an altar to the Lord at Araunah's threshing place.
1 Chronicles,21,19,"David obeyed the Lord 's command and went, as Gad had told him to."
1 Chronicles,21,20,"There at the threshing place Araunah and his four sons were threshing wheat, and when they saw the angel, the sons ran and hid."
1 Chronicles,21,21,"As soon as Araunah saw King David approaching, he left the threshing place and bowed low, with his face touching the ground."
1 Chronicles,21,22,"David said to him, “Sell me your threshing place, so that I can build an altar to the Lord , to stop the epidemic. I'll give you the full price.”"
1 Chronicles,21,23,"“Take it, Your Majesty,” Araunah said, “and do whatever you wish. Here are these oxen to burn as an offering on the altar, and here are the threshing boards to use as fuel, and wheat to give as an offering. I give it all to you.”"
1 Chronicles,21,24,"But the king answered, “No, I will pay you the full price. I will not give as an offering to the Lord something that belongs to you, something that costs me nothing.”"
1 Chronicles,21,25,And he paid Araunah six hundred gold coins for the threshing place.
1 Chronicles,21,26,"He built an altar to the Lord there and offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. He prayed, and the Lord answered him by sending fire from heaven to burn the sacrifices on the altar."
1 Chronicles,21,27,"The Lord told the angel to put his sword away, and the angel obeyed."
1 Chronicles,21,28,"David saw by this that the Lord had answered his prayer, so he offered sacrifices on the altar at Araunah's threshing place."
1 Chronicles,21,29,"The Tent of the Lord 's presence which Moses had made in the wilderness, and the altar on which sacrifices were burned were still at the place of worship at Gibeon at this time;"
1 Chronicles,21,30,"but David was not able to go there to worship God, because he was afraid of the sword of the Lord 's angel."
1 Chronicles,22,1,"So David said, “This is where the Temple of the Lord God will be. Here is the altar where the people of Israel are to offer burnt offerings.”"
1 Chronicles,22,2,"King David gave orders for all the foreigners living in the land of Israel to assemble, and he put them to work. Some of them prepared stone blocks for building the Temple."
1 Chronicles,22,3,"He supplied a large amount of iron for making nails and clamps for the wooden gates, and so much bronze that no one could weigh it."
1 Chronicles,22,4,He had the people of Tyre and Sidon bring him a large number of cedar logs.
1 Chronicles,22,5,"David thought, “The Temple that my son Solomon is to build must be splendid and world-famous. But he is young and inexperienced, so I must make preparations for it.” So David got large amounts of the materials ready before he died."
1 Chronicles,22,6,"He sent for his son Solomon and commanded him to build a temple for the Lord , the God of Israel."
1 Chronicles,22,7,"David said to him, “Son, I wanted to build a temple to honor the Lord my God."
1 Chronicles,22,8,"But the Lord told me that I had killed too many people and fought too many wars. And so, because of all the bloodshed I have caused, he would not let me build a temple for him."
1 Chronicles,22,9,"He did, however, make me a promise. He said, ‘You will have a son who will rule in peace, because I will give him peace from all his enemies. His name will be Solomon, because during his reign I will give Israel peace and security."
1 Chronicles,22,10,"He will build a temple for me. He will be my son, and I will be his father. His dynasty will rule Israel forever.’”"
1 Chronicles,22,11,"David continued, “Now, son, may the Lord your God be with you, and may he keep his promise to make you successful in building a temple for him."
1 Chronicles,22,12,And may the Lord your God give you insight and wisdom so that you may govern Israel according to his Law.
1 Chronicles,22,13,"If you obey all the laws which the Lord gave to Moses for Israel, you will be successful. Be determined and confident, and don't let anything make you afraid."
1 Chronicles,22,14,"As for the Temple, by my efforts I have accumulated almost four thousand tons of gold and nearly forty thousand tons of silver to be used in building it. Besides that, there is an unlimited supply of bronze and iron. I also have wood and stone ready, but you must get more."
1 Chronicles,22,15,"You have many workers. There are stonecutters to work in the quarries, and there are masons and carpenters, as well as a large number of skilled workers of every sort who can work"
1 Chronicles,22,16,"with gold, silver, bronze, and iron. Now begin the work, and may the Lord be with you.”"
1 Chronicles,22,17,David commanded all the leaders of Israel to help Solomon.
1 Chronicles,22,18,"He said, “The Lord your God has been with you and given you peace on all sides. He let me conquer all the people who used to live in this land, and they are now subject to you and to the Lord."
1 Chronicles,22,19,"Now serve the Lord your God with all your heart and soul. Start building the Temple, so that you can place in it the Covenant Box of the Lord and all the other sacred objects used in worshiping him.”"
1 Chronicles,23,1," When David was very old, he made his son Solomon king of Israel."
1 Chronicles,23,2,King David brought together all the Israelite leaders and all the priests and Levites.
1 Chronicles,23,3,He took a census of all the male Levites aged thirty or older. The total was thirty-eight thousand.
1 Chronicles,23,4,"The king assigned twenty-four thousand to administer the work of the Temple, six thousand to keep records and decide disputes,"
1 Chronicles,23,5,"four thousand to do guard duty, and four thousand to praise the Lord , using the musical instruments provided by the king for this purpose."
1 Chronicles,23,6,"David divided the Levites into three groups, according to their clans: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari."
1 Chronicles,23,7,Gershon had two sons: Ladan and Shimei.
1 Chronicles,23,8,"Ladan had three sons: Jehiel, Zetham, and Joel,"
1 Chronicles,23,9,"who were the heads of the clans descended from Ladan. (Shimei had three sons: Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran.)"
1 Chronicles,24,1,"These are the groups to which the descendants of Aaron belong. Aaron had four sons: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar."
1 Chronicles,24,2,"Nadab and Abihu died before their father did, and left no descendants, so their brothers Eleazar and Ithamar became priests."
1 Chronicles,24,3,"King David organized the descendants of Aaron into groups according to their duties. He was assisted in this by Zadok, a descendant of Eleazar, and by Ahimelech, a descendant of Ithamar."
1 Chronicles,24,4,"The descendants of Eleazar were organized into sixteen groups, while the descendants of Ithamar were organized into eight; this was done because there were more male heads of families among the descendants of Eleazar."
1 Chronicles,24,5,"Since there were Temple officials and spiritual leaders among the descendants of both Eleazar and Ithamar, assignments were made by drawing lots."
1 Chronicles,24,6,"The descendants of Eleazar and of Ithamar took turns drawing lots. Then they were registered by Shemaiah son of Nethanel, a Levite secretary. The king, his officials, the priest Zadok, Ahimelech son of Abiathar, and the heads of the priestly families and of the Levite families, were all witnesses."
1 Chronicles,25,1,"King David and the leaders of the Levites chose the following Levite clans to lead the worship services: Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun. They were to proclaim God's messages, accompanied by the music of harps and cymbals. This is the list of persons chosen to lead the worship, with the type of service that each group performed:"
1 Chronicles,25,2,"The four sons of Asaph: Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asharelah. They were under the direction of Asaph, who proclaimed God's messages whenever the king commanded."
1 Chronicles,25,3,"The six sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah. Under the direction of their father they proclaimed God's message, accompanied by the music of harps, and sang praise and thanks to the Lord."
1 Chronicles,25,4,"The fourteen sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, Romamti Ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth."
1 Chronicles,25,5,"God gave to Heman, the king's prophet, these fourteen sons and also three daughters, as he had promised, in order to give power to Heman."
1 Chronicles,25,6,"All of his sons played cymbals and harps under their father's direction, to accompany the Temple worship. And Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman were under orders from the king."
1 Chronicles,25,7,All these twenty-four men were experts; and their fellow Levites were trained musicians. There were 288 men in all.
1 Chronicles,25,8,"To determine the assignment of duties they all drew lots, whether they were young or old, experts or beginners."
1 Chronicles,26,1,"These are the assignments of work for the Levites who served as Temple guards. From the clan of Korah there was Meshelemiah son of Kore, of the family of Asaph."
1 Chronicles,26,2,"He had seven sons, listed in order of age: Zechariah, Jediael, Zebadiah, Jathniel,"
1 Chronicles,26,3,"Elam, Jehohanan, and Eliehoenai."
1 Chronicles,26,4," There was also Obed Edom, whom God blessed by giving him eight sons, listed in order of age: Shemaiah, Jehozabad, Joah, Sachar, Nethanel,"
1 Chronicles,26,5,"Ammiel, Issachar, and Peullethai."
1 Chronicles,27,1,This is the list of the Israelite heads of families and clan leaders and their officials who administered the work of the kingdom. Each month of the year a different group of twenty-four thousand men was on duty under the commander for that month.
1 Chronicles,28,1,"King David commanded all the officials of Israel to assemble in Jerusalem. So all the officials of the tribes, the officials who administered the work of the kingdom, the leaders of the clans, the supervisors of the property and livestock that belonged to the king and his sons—indeed all the palace officials, leading soldiers, and important men—gathered in Jerusalem."
1 Chronicles,28,2," David stood before them and addressed them: “My friends, listen to me. I wanted to build a permanent home for the Covenant Box, the footstool of the Lord our God. I have made preparations for building a temple to honor him,"
1 Chronicles,28,3,"but he has forbidden me to do it, because I am a soldier and have shed too much blood."
1 Chronicles,28,4,"The Lord , the God of Israel, chose me and my descendants to rule Israel forever. He chose the tribe of Judah to provide leadership, and out of Judah he chose my father's family. From all that family it was his pleasure to take me and make me king over all Israel."
1 Chronicles,28,5,"He gave me many sons, and out of them all he chose Solomon to rule over Israel, the Lord 's kingdom."
1 Chronicles,28,6,"“The Lord said to me, ‘Your son Solomon is the one who will build my Temple. I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father."
1 Chronicles,28,7,I will make his kingdom last forever if he continues to obey carefully all my laws and commands as he does now.’
1 Chronicles,28,8,"“So now, my people, in the presence of our God and of this assembly of all Israel, the Lord 's people, I charge you to obey carefully everything that the Lord our God has commanded us, so that you may continue to possess this good land and so that you may hand it on to succeeding generations forever.”"
1 Chronicles,28,9,"And to Solomon he said, “My son, I charge you to acknowledge your father's God and to serve him with an undivided heart and a willing mind. He knows all our thoughts and desires. If you go to him, he will accept you; but if you turn away from him, he will abandon you forever."
1 Chronicles,28,10,You must realize that the Lord has chosen you to build his holy Temple. Now do it—and do it with determination.”
1 Chronicles,28,11,"David gave Solomon the plans for all the Temple buildings, for the storerooms and all the other rooms, and for the Most Holy Place, where sins are forgiven."
1 Chronicles,28,12,"He also gave him the plans for all he had in mind for the courtyards and the rooms around them, and for the storerooms for the Temple equipment and the gifts dedicated to the Lord."
1 Chronicles,28,13,"David also gave him the plans for organizing the priests and Levites to perform their duties, to do the work of the Temple, and to take care of all the Temple utensils."
1 Chronicles,28,14,"He gave instructions as to how much silver and gold was to be used for making the utensils,"
1 Chronicles,28,15,"for each lamp and lampstand,"
1 Chronicles,28,16,"for the silver tables, and for each gold table on which were placed the loaves of bread offered to God."
1 Chronicles,28,17,"He also gave instructions as to how much pure gold was to be used in making forks, bowls, and jars, how much silver and gold in making dishes,"
1 Chronicles,28,18,and how much pure gold in making the altar on which incense was burned and in making the chariot for the winged creatures that spread their wings over the Lord 's Covenant Box.
