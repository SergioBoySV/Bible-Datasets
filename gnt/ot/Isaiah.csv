Isaiah,1,1," This book contains the messages about Judah and Jerusalem which God revealed to Isaiah son of Amoz during the time when Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah were kings of Judah."
Isaiah,1,2,"The Lord said, “Earth and sky, listen to what I am saying! The children I brought up have rebelled against me."
Isaiah,1,3,"Cattle know who owns them, and donkeys know where their master feeds them. But that is more than my people Israel know. They don't understand at all.”"
Isaiah,1,4,"You are doomed, you sinful nation, you corrupt and evil people! Your sins drag you down! You have rejected the Lord , the holy God of Israel, and have turned your backs on him."
Isaiah,1,5,"Why do you keep on rebelling? Do you want to be punished even more? Israel, your head is already covered with wounds, and your heart and mind are sick."
Isaiah,1,6,From head to foot there is not a healthy spot on your body. You are covered with bruises and sores and open wounds. Your wounds have not been cleaned or bandaged. No medicine has been put on them.
Isaiah,1,7,"Your country has been devastated, and your cities have been burned to the ground. While you look on, foreigners take over your land and bring everything to ruin."
Isaiah,1,8,"Jerusalem alone is left, a city under siege—as defenseless as a guard's hut in a vineyard or a shed in a cucumber field."
Isaiah,1,9,"If the Lord Almighty had not let some of the people survive, Jerusalem would have been totally destroyed, just as Sodom and Gomorrah were."
Isaiah,1,10,"Jerusalem, your rulers and your people are like those of Sodom and Gomorrah. Listen to what the Lord is saying to you. Pay attention to what our God is teaching you."
Isaiah,1,11,"He says, “Do you think I want all these sacrifices you keep offering to me? I have had more than enough of the sheep you burn as sacrifices and of the fat of your fine animals. I am tired of the blood of bulls and sheep and goats."
Isaiah,1,12,Who asked you to bring me all this when you come to worship me? Who asked you to do all this tramping around in my Temple?
Isaiah,1,13,"It's useless to bring your offerings. I am disgusted with the smell of the incense you burn. I cannot stand your New Moon Festivals, your Sabbaths, and your religious gatherings; they are all corrupted by your sins."
Isaiah,1,14,I hate your New Moon Festivals and holy days; they are a burden that I am tired of bearing.
Isaiah,1,15,"“When you lift your hands in prayer, I will not look at you. No matter how much you pray, I will not listen, for your hands are covered with blood."
Isaiah,1,16,"Wash yourselves clean. Stop all this evil that I see you doing. Yes, stop doing evil"
Isaiah,1,17,"and learn to do right. See that justice is done—help those who are oppressed, give orphans their rights, and defend widows.”"
Isaiah,1,18,"The Lord says, “Now, let's settle the matter. You are stained red with sin, but I will wash you as clean as snow. Although your stains are deep red, you will be as white as wool."
Isaiah,1,19,"If you will only obey me, you will eat the good things the land produces."
Isaiah,1,20,"But if you defy me, you are doomed to die. I, the Lord , have spoken.”"
Isaiah,1,21,"The city that once was faithful is behaving like a whore! At one time it was filled with righteous people, but now only murderers remain."
Isaiah,1,22,"Jerusalem, you were once like silver, but now you are worthless; you were like good wine, but now you are only water."
Isaiah,1,23,Your leaders are rebels and friends of thieves; they are always accepting gifts and bribes. They never defend orphans in court or listen when widows present their case.
Isaiah,1,24,"So now, listen to what the Lord Almighty, Israel's powerful God, is saying: “I will take revenge on you, my enemies, and you will cause me no more trouble."
Isaiah,1,25,"I will take action against you. I will purify you the way metal is refined, and will remove all your impurity."
Isaiah,1,26,"I will give you rulers and advisers like those you had long ago. Then Jerusalem will be called the righteous, faithful city.”"
Isaiah,1,27,"Because the Lord is righteous, he will save Jerusalem and everyone there who repents."
Isaiah,1,28,But he will crush everyone who sins and rebels against him; he will kill everyone who forsakes him.
Isaiah,1,29,You will be sorry that you ever worshiped trees and planted sacred gardens.
Isaiah,1,30,"You will wither like a dying oak, like a garden that no one waters."
Isaiah,1,31,"Just as straw is set on fire by a spark, so powerful people will be destroyed by their own evil deeds, and no one will be able to stop the destruction."
Isaiah,2,1,Here is the message which God gave to Isaiah son of Amoz about Judah and Jerusalem:
Isaiah,2,2,"In days to come the mountain where the Temple stands will be the highest one of all, towering above all the hills. Many nations will come streaming to it,"
Isaiah,2,3,"and their people will say, “Let us go up the hill of the Lord, to the Temple of Israel's God. He will teach us what he wants us to do; we will walk in the paths he has chosen. For the Lord 's teaching comes from Jerusalem; from Zion he speaks to his people.”"
Isaiah,2,4," He will settle disputes among great nations. They will hammer their swords into plows and their spears into pruning knives. Nations will never again go to war, never prepare for battle again."
Isaiah,2,5,"Now, descendants of Jacob, let us walk in the light which the Lord gives us!"
Isaiah,2,6,"O God, you have forsaken your people, the descendants of Jacob! The land is full of magic practices from the East and from Philistia. The people follow foreign customs."
Isaiah,2,7,"Their land is full of silver and gold, and there is no end to their treasures. Their land is full of horses, and there is no end to their chariots."
Isaiah,2,8,"Their land is full of idols, and they worship objects that they have made with their own hands."
Isaiah,2,9,"Everyone will be humiliated and disgraced. Do not forgive them, Lord!"
Isaiah,2,10, They will hide in caves in the rocky hills or dig holes in the ground to try to escape from the Lord 's anger and to hide from his power and glory!
Isaiah,2,11,A day is coming when human pride will be ended and human arrogance destroyed. Then the Lord alone will be exalted.
Isaiah,2,12,"On that day the Lord Almighty will humble everyone who is powerful, everyone who is proud and conceited."
Isaiah,2,13,He will destroy the tall cedars of Lebanon and all the oaks in the land of Bashan.
Isaiah,2,14,"He will level the high mountains and hills,"
Isaiah,2,15,"every high tower, and the walls of every fortress."
Isaiah,2,16,He will sink even the largest and most beautiful ships.
Isaiah,3,1,"Now the Lord, the Almighty Lord , is about to take away from Jerusalem and Judah everything and everyone that the people depend on. He is going to take away their food and their water,"
Isaiah,3,2,"their heroes and their soldiers, their judges and their prophets, their fortunetellers and their statesmen,"
Isaiah,3,3,"their military and civilian leaders, their politicians and everyone who uses magic to control events."
Isaiah,3,4,The Lord will let the people be governed by immature boys.
Isaiah,3,5,"Everyone will take advantage of everyone else. Young people will not respect their elders, and worthless people will not respect their superiors."
Isaiah,3,6,"A time will come when the members of a clan will choose one of their number and say to him, “You at least have something to wear, so be our leader in this time of trouble.”"
Isaiah,3,7,"But he will answer, “Not me! I can't help you. I don't have any food or clothes either. Don't make me your leader!”"
Isaiah,3,8,"Yes, Jerusalem is doomed! Judah is collapsing! Everything they say and do is against the Lord ; they openly insult God himself."
Isaiah,3,9,"Their prejudices will be held against them. They sin as openly as the people of Sodom did. They are doomed, and they have brought it on themselves."
Isaiah,3,10,"The righteous will be happy, and things will go well for them. They will get to enjoy what they have worked for."
Isaiah,3,11,But evil people are doomed; what they have done to others will now be done to them.
Isaiah,3,12,"Moneylenders oppress my people, and their creditors cheat them. My people, your leaders are misleading you, so that you do not know which way to turn."
Isaiah,3,13,The Lord is ready to state his case; he is ready to judge his people.
Isaiah,3,14,"The Lord is bringing the elders and leaders of his people to judgment. He makes this accusation: “You have plundered vineyards, and your houses are full of what you have taken from the poor."
Isaiah,3,15,"You have no right to crush my people and take advantage of the poor. I, the Sovereign Lord Almighty, have spoken.”"
Isaiah,3,16,"The Lord said, “Look how proud the women of Jerusalem are! They walk along with their noses in the air. They are always flirting. They take dainty little steps, and the bracelets on their ankles jingle."
Isaiah,3,17,But I will punish them—I will shave their heads and leave them bald.”
Isaiah,3,18,"A day is coming when the Lord will take away from the women of Jerusalem everything they are so proud of—the ornaments they wear on their ankles, on their heads, on their necks,"
Isaiah,3,19,and on their wrists. He will take away their veils
Isaiah,3,20,and their hats; the magic charms they wear on their arms and at their waists;
Isaiah,3,21,the rings they wear on their fingers and in their noses;
Isaiah,3,22,"all their fine robes, gowns, cloaks, and purses;"
Isaiah,3,23,"their revealing garments, their linen handkerchiefs, and the scarves and long veils they wear on their heads."
Isaiah,3,24,"Instead of using perfumes, they will stink; instead of fine belts, they will wear coarse ropes; instead of having beautiful hair, they will be bald; instead of fine clothes, they will be dressed in rags; their beauty will be turned to shame!"
Isaiah,3,25,"The men of the city, yes, even the strongest men, will be killed in war."
Isaiah,3,26,"The city gates will mourn and cry, and the city itself will be like a woman sitting on the ground, stripped naked."
Isaiah,4,1,"When that time comes, seven women will grab hold of one man and say, “We can feed and clothe ourselves, but please let us say you are our husband, so that we won't have to endure the shame of being unmarried.”"
Isaiah,4,2,The time is coming when the Lord will make every plant and tree in the land grow large and beautiful. All the people of Israel who survive will take delight and pride in the crops that the land produces.
Isaiah,4,3,"Everyone who is left in Jerusalem, whom God has chosen for survival, will be called holy."
Isaiah,4,4,By his power the Lord will judge and purify the nation and wash away the guilt of Jerusalem and the blood that has been shed there.
Isaiah,4,5,"Then over Mount Zion and over all who are gathered there, the Lord will send a cloud in the daytime and smoke and a bright flame at night. God's glory will cover and protect the whole city."
Isaiah,4,6,"His glory will shade the city from the heat of the day and make it a place of safety, sheltered from the rain and storm."
Isaiah,5,1," Listen while I sing you this song, a song of my friend and his vineyard: My friend had a vineyard on a very fertile hill."
Isaiah,5,2,"He dug the soil and cleared it of stones; he planted the finest vines. He built a tower to guard them, dug a pit for treading the grapes. He waited for the grapes to ripen, but every grape was sour."
Isaiah,5,3,"So now my friend says, “You people who live in Jerusalem and Judah, judge between my vineyard and me."
Isaiah,5,4,Is there anything I failed to do for it? Then why did it produce sour grapes and not the good grapes I expected?
Isaiah,5,5,"“Here is what I am going to do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge around it, break down the wall that protects it, and let wild animals eat it and trample it down."
Isaiah,5,6,"I will let it be overgrown with weeds. I will not trim the vines or hoe the ground; instead, I will let briers and thorns cover it. I will even forbid the clouds to let rain fall on it.”"
Isaiah,5,7,"Israel is the vineyard of the Lord Almighty; the people of Judah are the vines he planted. He expected them to do what was good, but instead they committed murder. He expected them to do what was right, but their victims cried out for justice."
Isaiah,5,8,"You are doomed! You buy more houses and fields to add to those you already have. Soon there will be no place for anyone else to live, and you alone will live in the land."
Isaiah,5,9,"I have heard the Lord Almighty say, “All these big, fine houses will be empty ruins."
Isaiah,5,10,The grapevines growing on five acres of land will yield only five gallons of wine. Ten bushels of seed will produce only one bushel of grain.”
Isaiah,5,11," You are doomed! You get up early in the morning to start drinking, and you spend long evenings getting drunk."
Isaiah,5,12,"At your feasts you have harps and tambourines and flutes—and wine. But you don't understand what the Lord is doing,"
Isaiah,5,13,"and so you will be carried away as prisoners. Your leaders will starve to death, and the common people will die of thirst."
Isaiah,5,14,"The world of the dead is hungry for them, and it opens its mouth wide. It gulps down the nobles of Jerusalem along with the noisy crowd of common people."
Isaiah,5,15,"Everyone will be disgraced, and all who are proud will be humbled."
Isaiah,5,16,"But the Lord Almighty shows his greatness by doing what is right, and he reveals his holiness by judging his people."
Isaiah,5,17,In the ruins of the cities lambs will eat grass and young goats will find pasture.
Isaiah,5,18,You are doomed! You are unable to break free from your sins.
Isaiah,5,19,"You say, “Let the Lord hurry up and do what he says he will, so that we can see it. Let Israel's holy God carry out his plans; let's see what he has in mind.”"
Isaiah,5,20,"You are doomed! You call evil good and call good evil. You turn darkness into light and light into darkness. You make what is bitter sweet, and what is sweet you make bitter."
Isaiah,5,21,"You are doomed! You think you are wise, so very clever."
Isaiah,5,22,You are doomed! Heroes of the wine bottle! Brave and fearless when it comes to mixing drinks!
Isaiah,5,23,"But for just a bribe you let the guilty go free, and you keep the innocent from getting justice."
Isaiah,5,24,"So now, just as straw and dry grass shrivel and burn in the fire, your roots will rot and your blossoms will dry up and blow away, because you have rejected what the Lord Almighty, Israel's holy God, has taught us."
Isaiah,5,25,"The Lord is angry with his people and has stretched out his hand to punish them. The mountains will shake, and the bodies of those who die will be left in the streets like rubbish. Yet even then the Lord 's anger will not be ended, but his hand will still be stretched out to punish."
Isaiah,5,26,"The Lord gives a signal to call for a distant nation. He whistles for them to come from the ends of the earth. And here they come, swiftly, quickly!"
Isaiah,5,27,None of them grow tired; none of them stumble. They never doze or sleep. Not a belt is loose; not a sandal strap is broken.
Isaiah,5,28,"Their arrows are sharp, and their bows are ready to shoot. Their horses' hoofs are as hard as flint, and their chariot wheels turn like a whirlwind."
Isaiah,5,29,The soldiers roar like lions that have killed an animal and are carrying it off where no one can take it away from them.
Isaiah,5,30,"When that day comes, they will roar over Israel as loudly as the sea. Look at this country! Darkness and distress! The light is swallowed by darkness."
Isaiah,6,1," In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord. He was sitting on his throne, high and exalted, and his robe filled the whole Temple."
Isaiah,6,2,"Around him flaming creatures were standing, each of which had six wings. Each creature covered its face with two wings, and its body with two, and used the other two for flying."
Isaiah,6,3,"They were calling out to each other: “Holy, holy, holy! The Lord Almighty is holy! His glory fills the world.”"
Isaiah,6,4," The sound of their voices made the foundation of the Temple shake, and the Temple itself became filled with smoke."
Isaiah,6,5,"I said, “There is no hope for me! I am doomed because every word that passes my lips is sinful, and I live among a people whose every word is sinful. And yet, with my own eyes I have seen the King, the Lord Almighty.”"
Isaiah,6,6,"Then one of the creatures flew down to me, carrying a burning coal that he had taken from the altar with a pair of tongs."
Isaiah,6,7,"He touched my lips with the burning coal and said, “This has touched your lips, and now your guilt is gone, and your sins are forgiven.”"
Isaiah,6,8,"Then I heard the Lord say, “Whom shall I send? Who will be our messenger?” I answered, “I will go! Send me!”"
Isaiah,6,9," So he told me to go and give the people this message: “No matter how much you listen, you will not understand. No matter how much you look, you will not know what is happening.”"
Isaiah,6,10,"Then he said to me, “Make the minds of these people dull, their ears deaf, and their eyes blind, so that they cannot see or hear or understand. If they did, they might turn to me and be healed.”"
Isaiah,6,11,"I asked, “How long will it be like this, Lord?” He answered, “Until the cities are ruined and empty—until the houses are uninhabited—until the land itself is a desolate wasteland."
Isaiah,6,12,I will send the people far away and make the whole land desolate.
Isaiah,6,13,"Even if one person out of ten remains in the land, he too will be destroyed; he will be like the stump of an oak tree that has been cut down.” (The stump represents a new beginning for God's people.)"
Isaiah,7,1," When King Ahaz, the son of Jotham and grandson of Uzziah, ruled Judah, war broke out. Rezin, king of Syria, and Pekah son of Remaliah, king of Israel, attacked Jerusalem, but were unable to capture it."
Isaiah,7,2,"When word reached the king of Judah that the armies of Syria were already in the territory of Israel, he and all his people were so terrified that they trembled like trees shaking in the wind."
Isaiah,7,3,"The Lord said to Isaiah, “Take your son Shear Jashub, and go to meet King Ahaz. You will find him on the road where the cloth makers work, at the end of the ditch that brings water from the upper pool."
Isaiah,7,4,"Tell him to keep alert, to stay calm, and not to be frightened or disturbed. The anger of King Rezin and his Syrians and of King Pekah is no more dangerous than the smoke from two smoldering sticks of wood."
Isaiah,7,5,"Syria, together with Israel and its king, has made a plot."
Isaiah,7,6,"They intend to invade Judah, terrify the people into joining their side, and then put Tabeel's son on the throne."
Isaiah,7,7,"“But I, the Lord , declare that this will never happen."
Isaiah,7,8,"Why? Because Syria is no stronger than Damascus, its capital city, and Damascus is no stronger than King Rezin. As for Israel, within sixty-five years it will be too shattered to survive as a nation."
Isaiah,7,9,"Israel is no stronger than Samaria, its capital city, and Samaria is no stronger than King Pekah. “If your faith is not enduring, you will not endure.”"
Isaiah,7,10,The Lord sent another message to Ahaz:
Isaiah,7,11,“Ask the Lord your God to give you a sign. It can be from deep in the world of the dead or from high up in heaven.”
Isaiah,7,12,"Ahaz answered, “I will not ask for a sign. I refuse to put the Lord to the test.”"
Isaiah,7,13,"To that Isaiah replied, “Listen, now, descendants of King David. It's bad enough for you to wear out the patience of people—do you have to wear out God's patience too?"
Isaiah,7,14,"Well then, the Lord himself will give you a sign: a young woman who is pregnant will have a son and will name him ‘Immanuel.’"
Isaiah,7,15,"By the time he is old enough to make his own decisions, people will be drinking milk and eating honey."
Isaiah,7,16,"Even before that time comes, the lands of those two kings who terrify you will be deserted."
Isaiah,7,17,"“The Lord is going to bring on you, on your people, and on the whole royal family, days of trouble worse than any that have come since the kingdom of Israel separated from Judah—he is going to bring the king of Assyria."
Isaiah,7,18,"“When that time comes, the Lord will whistle as a signal for the Egyptians to come like flies from the farthest branches of the Nile, and for the Assyrians to come from their land like bees."
Isaiah,7,19,"They will swarm in the rugged valleys and in the caves in the rocks, and they will cover every thorn bush and every pasture."
Isaiah,7,20,"“When that time comes, the Lord will hire a barber from across the Euphrates—the emperor of Assyria!—and he will shave off your beards and the hair on your heads and your bodies."
Isaiah,7,21,"“When that time comes, even if a farmer has been able to save only one young cow and two goats,"
Isaiah,7,22,"they will give so much milk that he will have all he needs. Yes, the few survivors left in the land will have milk and honey to eat."
Isaiah,7,23,"“When that time comes, the fine vineyards, each with a thousand vines and each worth a thousand pieces of silver, will be overgrown with thorn bushes and briers."
Isaiah,7,24,"People will go hunting there with bows and arrows. Yes, the whole country will be full of briers and thorn bushes."
Isaiah,7,25,All the hills where crops were once planted will be so overgrown with thorns that no one will go there. It will be a place where cattle and sheep graze.”
Isaiah,8,1,"The Lord said to me, “Take a large piece of writing material and write on it in large letters: ‘Quick Loot, Fast Plunder.’"
Isaiah,8,2,"Get two reliable men, the priest Uriah and Zechariah son of Jeberechiah, to serve as witnesses.”"
Isaiah,8,3,"Some time later my wife became pregnant. When our son was born, the Lord said to me, “Name him ‘Quick-Loot-Fast-Plunder.’"
Isaiah,8,4,"Before the boy is old enough to say ‘Mamma’ and ‘Daddy,’ all the wealth of Damascus and all the loot of Samaria will be carried off by the king of Assyria.”"
Isaiah,8,5,The Lord spoke to me again.
Isaiah,8,6,"He said, “Because these people have rejected the quiet waters of Shiloah Brook and tremble before King Rezin and King Pekah,"
Isaiah,8,7,"I, the Lord, will bring the emperor of Assyria and all his forces to attack Judah. They will advance like the flood waters of the Euphrates River, overflowing all its banks."
Isaiah,8,8,"They will sweep through Judah in a flood, rising shoulder high and covering everything.” God is with us! His outspread wings protect the land."
Isaiah,8,9,"Gather together in fear, you nations! Listen, you distant parts of the earth. Get ready to fight, but be afraid! Yes, get ready, but be afraid!"
Isaiah,8,10,"Make your plans! But they will never succeed. Talk all you want to! But it is all useless, because God is with us."
Isaiah,8,11,"With his great power the Lord warned me not to follow the road which the people were following. He said,"
Isaiah,8,12,“Do not join in the schemes of the people and do not be afraid of the things that they fear.
Isaiah,8,13,"Remember that I, the Lord Almighty, am holy; I am the one you must fear."
Isaiah,8,14,Because of my awesome holiness I am like a stone that people stumble over; I am like a trap that will catch the people of the kingdoms of Judah and Israel and the people of Jerusalem.
Isaiah,8,15,Many will stumble; they will fall and be crushed. They will be caught in a trap.”
Isaiah,8,16,"You, my disciples, are to guard and preserve the messages that God has given me."
Isaiah,8,17,"The Lord has hidden himself from his people, but I trust him and place my hope in him."
Isaiah,8,18," Here I am with the children the Lord has given me. The Lord Almighty, whose throne is on Mount Zion, has sent us as living messages to the people of Israel."
Isaiah,8,19,"But people will tell you to ask for messages from fortunetellers and mediums, who chirp and mutter. They will say, “After all, people should ask for messages from the spirits and consult the dead on behalf of the living.”"
Isaiah,8,20,"You are to answer them, “Listen to what the Lord is teaching you! Don't listen to mediums—what they tell you cannot keep trouble away.”"
Isaiah,8,21,"The people will wander through the land, discouraged and hungry. In their hunger and their anger they will curse their king and their God. They may look up to the sky"
Isaiah,8,22,"or stare at the ground, but they will see nothing but trouble and darkness, terrifying darkness into which they are being driven."
Isaiah,9,1," There will be no way for them to escape from this time of trouble. The land of the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali was once disgraced, but the future will bring honor to this region, from the Mediterranean eastward to the land on the other side of the Jordan, and even to Galilee itself, where the foreigners live."
Isaiah,9,2," The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light. They lived in a land of shadows, but now light is shining on them."
Isaiah,9,3,"You have given them great joy, Lord; you have made them happy. They rejoice in what you have done, as people rejoice when they harvest grain or when they divide captured wealth."
Isaiah,9,4,"For you have broken the yoke that burdened them and the rod that beat their shoulders. You have defeated the nation that oppressed and exploited your people, just as you defeated the army of Midian long ago."
Isaiah,9,5,The boots of the invading army and all their bloodstained clothing will be destroyed by fire.
Isaiah,9,6,"A child is born to us! A son is given to us! And he will be our ruler. He will be called, “Wonderful Counselor,” “Mighty God,” “Eternal Father,” “Prince of Peace.”"
Isaiah,9,7," His royal power will continue to grow; his kingdom will always be at peace. He will rule as King David's successor, basing his power on right and justice, from now until the end of time. The Lord Almighty is determined to do all this."
Isaiah,9,8,"The Lord has pronounced judgment on the kingdom of Israel, on the descendants of Jacob."
Isaiah,9,9,"All the people of Israel, everyone who lives in the city of Samaria, will know that he has done this. Now they are proud and arrogant. They say,"
Isaiah,9,10,"“The brick buildings have fallen down, but we will replace them with stone buildings. The beams of sycamore wood have been cut down, but we will replace them with the finest cedar.”"
Isaiah,9,11,The Lord has stirred up their enemies to attack them.
Isaiah,9,12,Syria on the east and Philistia on the west have opened their mouths to devour Israel. Yet even so the Lord 's anger is not ended; his hand is still stretched out to punish.
Isaiah,9,13,"The people of Israel have not repented; even though the Lord Almighty has punished them, they have not returned to him."
Isaiah,9,14,"In a single day the Lord will punish Israel's leaders and its people; he will cut them off, head and tail."
Isaiah,9,15,The old and honorable men are the head—and the tail is the prophets whose teachings are lies!
Isaiah,9,16,Those who lead these people have misled them and totally confused them.
Isaiah,9,17,"And so the Lord will not let any of the young men escape, and he will not show pity on any of the widows and orphans, because all the people are godless and wicked and everything they say is evil. Yet even so the Lord 's anger will not be ended, but his hand will still be stretched out to punish."
Isaiah,9,18,The wickedness of the people burns like a fire that destroys thorn bushes and thistles. It burns like a forest fire that sends up columns of smoke.
Isaiah,9,19,"Because the Lord Almighty is angry, his punishment burns like a fire throughout the land and destroys the people, and it is each of us for ourselves."
Isaiah,9,20,"Everywhere in the country people snatch and eat any bit of food they can find, but their hunger is never satisfied. They even eat their own children!"
Isaiah,9,21,"The people of Manasseh and the people of Ephraim attack each other, and together they attack Judah. Yet even so the Lord 's anger is not ended; his hand is still stretched out to punish."
Isaiah,10,1,You are doomed! You make unjust laws that oppress my people.
Isaiah,10,2,That is how you keep the poor from having their rights and from getting justice. That is how you take the property that belongs to widows and orphans.
Isaiah,10,3,What will you do when God punishes you? What will you do when he brings disaster on you from a distant country? Where will you run to find help? Where will you hide your wealth?
Isaiah,10,4,You will be killed in battle or dragged off as prisoners. Yet even so the Lord 's anger will not be ended; his hand will still be stretched out to punish.
Isaiah,10,5," The Lord said, “Assyria! I use Assyria like a club to punish those with whom I am angry."
Isaiah,10,6,"I sent Assyria to attack a godless nation, people who have made me angry. I sent them to loot and steal and trample the people like dirt in the streets.”"
Isaiah,10,7,But the Assyrian emperor has his own violent plans in mind. He is determined to destroy many nations.
Isaiah,10,8,"He boasts, “Every one of my commanders is a king!"
Isaiah,10,9,"I conquered the cities of Calno and Carchemish, the cities of Hamath and Arpad. I conquered Samaria and Damascus."
Isaiah,10,10,"I reached out to punish those kingdoms that worship idols, idols more numerous than those of Jerusalem and Samaria."
Isaiah,10,11,"I have destroyed Samaria and all its idols, and I will do the same to Jerusalem and the images that are worshiped there.”"
Isaiah,10,12,"But the Lord says, “When I finish what I am doing on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, I will punish the emperor of Assyria for all his boasting and all his pride.”"
Isaiah,10,13,"The emperor of Assyria boasts, “I have done it all myself. I am strong and wise and clever. I wiped out the boundaries between nations and took the supplies they had stored. Like a bull I have trampled the people who live there."
Isaiah,10,14,"The nations of the world were like a bird's nest, and I gathered their wealth as easily as gathering eggs. Not a wing fluttered to scare me off; no beak opened to scream at me!”"
Isaiah,10,15,"But the Lord says, “Can an ax claim to be greater than the one who uses it? Is a saw more important than the one who saws with it? A club doesn't lift up a person; a person lifts up a club.”"
Isaiah,10,16,The Lord Almighty is going to send disease to punish those who are now well-fed. In their bodies there will be a fire that burns and burns.
Isaiah,10,17,"God, the light of Israel, will become a fire. Israel's holy God will become a flame, which in a single day will burn up everything, even the thorns and thistles."

Isaiah,24,14,"Those who survive will sing for joy. Those in the West will tell how great the Lord is,"
Isaiah,24,15,"and those in the East will praise him. The people who live along the sea will praise the Lord , the God of Israel."
Isaiah,24,16,"From the most distant parts of the world we will hear songs in praise of Israel, the righteous nation. But there is no hope for me! I am wasting away! Traitors continue to betray, and their treachery grows worse and worse."

Isaiah,27,7,Israel has not been punished by the Lord as severely as its enemies nor lost as many people.
Isaiah,27,8,The Lord punished his people by sending them into exile. He took them away with a cruel wind from the east.
Isaiah,27,9,"But Israel's sins will be forgiven only when the stones of pagan altars are ground up like chalk, and no more incense altars or symbols of the goddess Asherah are left."
Isaiah,27,10,"The fortified city lies in ruins. It is deserted like an empty wilderness. It has become a pasture for cattle, where they can rest and graze."

Isaiah,28,8,"The tables where they sit are all covered with vomit, and not a clean spot is left."
Isaiah,28,9,"They complain about me. They say, “Who does that man think he's teaching? Who needs his message? It's only good for babies that have just stopped nursing!"
Isaiah,28,10,"He is trying to teach us letter by letter, line by line, lesson by lesson.”"
Isaiah,28,11," If you won't listen to me, then God will use foreigners speaking some strange-sounding language to teach you a lesson."
Isaiah,28,12,"He offered rest and comfort to all of you, but you refused to listen to him."
Isaiah,28,13,"That is why the Lord is going to teach you letter by letter, line by line, lesson by lesson. Then you will stumble with every step you take. You will be wounded, trapped, and taken prisoner."
Isaiah,28,14,"Now you arrogant leaders who rule here in Jerusalem over this people, listen to what the Lord is saying."
Isaiah,28,15,"You boast that you have made a treaty with death and reached an agreement with the world of the dead. You are certain that disaster will spare you when it comes, because you depend on lies and deceit to keep you safe."
Isaiah,28,16,"This, now, is what the Sovereign Lord says: “I am placing in Zion a foundation that is firm and strong. In it I am putting a solid cornerstone on which are written the words, ‘Faith that is firm is also patient.’"
Isaiah,28,17,"Justice will be the measuring line for the foundation, and honesty will be its plumb line.” Hailstorms will sweep away all the lies you depend on, and floods will destroy your security."

Isaiah,28,21,"The Lord will fight as he did at Mount Perazim and in the valley of Gibeon, in order to do what he intends to do—strange as his actions may seem. He will complete his work, his mysterious work."
Isaiah,28,22,"Don't laugh at the warning I am giving you! If you do, it will be even harder for you to escape. I have heard the Lord Almighty's decision to destroy the whole country."
Isaiah,28,23,Listen to what I am saying; pay attention to what I am telling you.
Isaiah,28,24,Farmers don't constantly plow their fields and keep getting them ready for planting.
Isaiah,28,25,"Once they have prepared the soil, they plant the seeds of herbs such as dill and cumin. They plant rows of wheat and barley, and at the edges of their fields they plant other grain."
Isaiah,28,26,"They know how to do their work, because God has taught them."
Isaiah,28,27,They never use a heavy club to beat out dill seeds or cumin seeds; instead they use light sticks of the proper size.
Isaiah,28,28,"They do not ruin the wheat by threshing it endlessly, and they know how to thresh it by driving a cart over it without bruising the grains."
Isaiah,28,29,"All this wisdom comes from the Lord Almighty. The plans God makes are wise, and they always succeed."
Isaiah,29,1,"God's altar, Jerusalem itself, is doomed! The city where David camped is doomed! Let another year or two come and go, with its feasts and festivals,"
Isaiah,29,2,"and then God will bring disaster on the city that is called “God's altar.” There will be weeping and wailing, and the whole city will be like an altar covered with blood."
Isaiah,29,3,"God will attack the city, surround it, and besiege it."
Isaiah,29,4,"Jerusalem will be like a ghost struggling to speak from under the ground, a muffled voice coming from the dust."
Isaiah,29,5,"Jerusalem, all the foreigners who attack you will be blown away like dust, and their terrifying armies will fly away like straw. Suddenly and unexpectedly"
Isaiah,29,6,the Lord Almighty will rescue you with violent thunderstorms and earthquakes. He will send windstorms and raging fire;
Isaiah,29,7,"then all the armies of the nations attacking the city of God's altar, all their weapons and equipment—everything—will vanish like a dream, like something imagined in the night."
Isaiah,29,8,"All the nations that assemble to attack Jerusalem will be like a starving person who dreams he is eating and wakes up hungry, or like someone dying of thirst who dreams he is drinking and wakes with a dry throat."
Isaiah,29,9,Go ahead and be stupid! Go ahead and be blind! Get drunk without any wine! Stagger without drinking a drop!
Isaiah,29,10,"The Lord has made you drowsy, ready to fall into a deep sleep. The prophets should be the eyes of the people, but God has blindfolded them."
Isaiah,29,11,"The meaning of every prophetic vision will be hidden from you; it will be like a sealed scroll. If you take it to someone who knows how to read and ask him to read it to you, he will say he can't because it is sealed."
Isaiah,29,12,"If you give it to someone who can't read and ask him to read it to you, he will answer that he doesn't know how."
Isaiah,29,13," The Lord said, “These people claim to worship me, but their words are meaningless, and their hearts are somewhere else. Their religion is nothing but human rules and traditions, which they have simply memorized."
Isaiah,29,14,"So I will startle them with one unexpected blow after another. Those who are wise will turn out to be fools, and all their cleverness will be useless.”"
Isaiah,29,15,Those who try to hide their plans from the Lord are doomed! They carry out their schemes in secret and think no one will see them or know what they are doing.
Isaiah,29,16,"They turn everything upside down. Which is more important, the potter or the clay? Can something you have made say, “You didn't make me”? Or can it say, “You don't know what you are doing”?"
Isaiah,29,17,"As the saying goes, before long the dense forest will become farmland, and the farmland will go back to forest."
Isaiah,29,18,"When that day comes, the deaf will be able to hear a book being read aloud, and the blind, who have been living in darkness, will open their eyes and see."
Isaiah,29,19,"Poor and humble people will once again find the happiness which the Lord , the holy God of Israel, gives."
Isaiah,29,20,It will be the end of those who oppress others and show contempt for God. Every sinner will be destroyed.
Isaiah,29,21,"God will destroy those who slander others, those who prevent the punishment of criminals, and those who tell lies to keep honest people from getting justice."
Isaiah,29,22,"So now the Lord , the God of Israel, who rescued Abraham from trouble, says, “My people, you will not be disgraced any longer, and your faces will no longer be pale with shame."
Isaiah,29,23,"When you see the children that I will give you, then you will acknowledge that I am the holy God of Israel. You will honor me and stand in awe of me."

Isaiah,30,1,"The Lord has spoken: “Those who rule Judah are doomed because they rebel against me. They follow plans that I did not make, and sign treaties against my will, piling one sin on another."
Isaiah,30,2,"They go to Egypt for help without asking for my advice. They want Egypt to protect them, so they put their trust in Egypt's king."
Isaiah,30,3,"But the king will be powerless to help them, and Egypt's protection will end in disaster."
Isaiah,30,4,"Although their ambassadors have already arrived at the Egyptian cities of Zoan and Hanes,"
Isaiah,30,5,"the people of Judah will regret that they ever trusted that unreliable nation, a nation that fails them when they expect help.”"
Isaiah,30,6,"This is God's message about the animals of the southern desert: “The ambassadors travel through dangerous country, where lions live and where there are poisonous snakes and flying dragons. They load their donkeys and camels with expensive gifts for a nation that cannot give them any help."
Isaiah,30,7,"The help that Egypt gives is useless. So I have nicknamed Egypt, ‘The Harmless Dragon.’”"
Isaiah,30,8,"God told me to write down in a book what the people are like, so that there would be a permanent record of how evil they are."
Isaiah,30,9,"They are always rebelling against God, always lying, always refusing to listen to the Lord 's teachings."
Isaiah,30,10,"They tell the prophets to keep quiet. They say, “Don't talk to us about what's right. Tell us what we want to hear. Let us keep our illusions."
Isaiah,30,11,Get out of our way and stop blocking our path. We don't want to hear about your holy God of Israel.”
Isaiah,30,12,But this is what the holy God of Israel says: “You ignore what I tell you and rely on violence and deceit.
Isaiah,30,13,You are guilty. You are like a high wall with a crack running down it; suddenly you will collapse.
Isaiah,30,14,"You will be shattered like a clay pot, so badly broken that there is no piece big enough to pick up hot coals with or to dip water from a cistern.”"
Isaiah,30,15,"The Sovereign Lord , the Holy One of Israel, says to the people, “Come back and quietly trust in me. Then you will be strong and secure.” But you refuse to do it."
Isaiah,30,16,"Instead, you plan to escape from your enemies by riding fast horses. And you are right—escape is what you will have to do! You think your horses are fast enough, but those who pursue you will be faster!"
Isaiah,30,17,"A thousand of you will run away when you see one enemy soldier, and five soldiers will be enough to make you all run away. Nothing will be left of your army except a lonely flagpole on the top of a hill."
Isaiah,30,18,And yet the Lord is waiting to be merciful to you. He is ready to take pity on you because he always does what is right. Happy are those who put their trust in the Lord.
Isaiah,30,19,"You people who live in Jerusalem will not weep any more. The Lord is compassionate, and when you cry to him for help, he will answer you."

Isaiah,31,1,"Those who go to Egypt for help are doomed! They are relying on Egypt's vast military strength—horses, chariots, and soldiers. But they do not rely on the Lord , the holy God of Israel, or ask him for help."
Isaiah,31,2,He knows what he is doing! He sends disaster. He carries out his threats to punish evil people and those who protect them.
Isaiah,31,3,"The Egyptians are not gods—they are only human. Their horses are not supernatural. When the Lord acts, the strong nation will crumble, and the weak nation it helped will fall. Both of them will be destroyed."
Isaiah,31,4,"The Lord said to me, “No matter how shepherds yell and shout, they can't scare away a lion from an animal that it has killed; in the same way, there is nothing that can keep me, the Lord Almighty, from protecting Mount Zion."

Isaiah,33,13,Let everyone near and far hear what I have done and acknowledge my power.”
Isaiah,33,14,"The sinful people of Zion are trembling with fright. They say, “God's judgment is like a fire that burns forever. Can any of us survive a fire like that?”"
Isaiah,33,15,You can survive if you say and do what is right. Don't use your power to cheat the poor and don't accept bribes. Don't join with those who plan to commit murder or to do other evil things.
Isaiah,33,16,Then you will be safe; you will be as secure as if in a strong fortress. You will have food to eat and water to drink.

Isaiah,33,21,"The Lord will show us his glory. We will live beside broad rivers and streams, but hostile ships will not sail on them."

Isaiah,34,7,"The people will fall like wild oxen and young bulls, and the earth will be red with blood and covered with fat."
Isaiah,34,8,This is the time when the Lord will rescue Zion and take vengeance on her enemies.
Isaiah,34,9,"The rivers of Edom will turn into tar, and the soil will turn into sulfur. The whole country will burn like tar."
Isaiah,34,10,"It will burn day and night, and smoke will rise from it forever. The land will lie waste age after age, and no one will ever travel through it again."
Isaiah,34,11,"Owls and ravens will take over the land. The Lord will make it a barren waste again, as it was before the creation."
Isaiah,34,12,"There will be no king to rule the country, and the leaders will all be gone."
Isaiah,34,13,"Thorns and thistles will grow up in all the palaces and walled towns, and jackals and owls will live in them."
Isaiah,34,14,"Wild animals will roam there, and demons will call to each other. The night monster will come there looking for a place to rest."
Isaiah,34,15,"Owls will build their nests, lay eggs, hatch their young, and care for them there. Vultures will gather there, one after another."
Isaiah,34,16,"Search in the Lord 's book of living creatures and read what it says. Not one of these creatures will be missing, and not one will be without its mate. The Lord has commanded it to be so; he himself will bring them together."
Isaiah,34,17,"It is the Lord who will divide the land among them and give each of them a share. They will live in the land age after age, and it will belong to them forever."

Isaiah,36,1,"In the fourteenth year that Hezekiah was king of Judah, Sennacherib, the emperor of Assyria, attacked the fortified cities of Judah and captured them."
Isaiah,36,2,"Then he ordered his chief official to go from Lachish to Jerusalem with a large military force to demand that King Hezekiah surrender. The official occupied the road where the cloth makers work, by the ditch that brings water from the upper pool."
Isaiah,36,3,"Three Judeans came out to meet him: the official in charge of the palace, Eliakim son of Hilkiah; the court secretary, Shebna; and the official in charge of the records, Joah son of Asaph."
Isaiah,36,4,The Assyrian official told them that the emperor wanted to know what made King Hezekiah so confident.
Isaiah,36,5,"He demanded, “Do you think that words can take the place of military skill and might? Who do you think will help you rebel against Assyria?"
Isaiah,36,6,"You are expecting Egypt to help you, but that would be like using a reed as a walking stick—it would break and would jab your hand. That is what the king of Egypt is like when anyone relies on him.”"
Isaiah,36,7,"The Assyrian official went on, “Or will you tell me that you are relying on the Lord your God? It was the Lord 's shrines and altars that Hezekiah destroyed when he told the people of Judah and Jerusalem to worship at one altar only."
Isaiah,36,8,I will make a bargain with you in the name of the emperor. I will give you two thousand horses if you can find that many riders.
Isaiah,36,9,"You are no match for even the lowest ranking Assyrian official, and yet you expect the Egyptians to send you chariots and horsemen."
Isaiah,36,10,Do you think I have attacked your country and destroyed it without the Lord 's help? The Lord himself told me to attack it and destroy it.”
Isaiah,36,11,"Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah told the official, “Speak Aramaic to us. We understand it. Don't speak Hebrew; all the people on the wall are listening.”"
Isaiah,36,12,"He replied, “Do you think you and the king are the only ones the emperor sent me to say all these things to? No, I am also talking to the people who are sitting on the wall, who will have to eat their excrement and drink their urine, just as you will.”"
Isaiah,36,13,"Then the official stood up and shouted in Hebrew, “Listen to what the emperor of Assyria is telling you."
Isaiah,36,14,He warns you not to let Hezekiah deceive you. Hezekiah can't save you.
Isaiah,36,15,And don't let him persuade you to rely on the Lord . Don't think that the Lord will save you and that he will stop our Assyrian army from capturing your city.
Isaiah,36,16,"Don't listen to Hezekiah! The emperor of Assyria commands you to come out of the city and surrender. You will all be allowed to eat grapes from your own vines and figs from your own trees, and to drink water from your own wells—"
Isaiah,36,17,"until the emperor resettles you in a country much like your own, where there are vineyards to give wine and there is grain for making bread."
Isaiah,36,18,Don't let Hezekiah fool you into thinking that the Lord will rescue you. Did the gods of any other nations save their countries from the emperor of Assyria?
Isaiah,36,19,"Where are they now, the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Did anyone save Samaria?"
Isaiah,36,20,When did any of the gods of all these countries ever save their country from our emperor? Then what makes you think the Lord can save Jerusalem?”
Isaiah,36,21,"The people kept quiet, just as King Hezekiah had told them to; they did not say a word."
Isaiah,36,22,"Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah tore their clothes in grief and went and reported to the king what the Assyrian official had said."
Isaiah,37,1,"As soon as King Hezekiah heard their report, he tore his clothes in grief, put on sackcloth, and went to the Temple of the Lord."
Isaiah,37,2,"He sent Eliakim, the official in charge of the palace, Shebna, the court secretary, and the senior priests to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz. They also were wearing sackcloth."
Isaiah,37,3,"This is the message which he told them to give to Isaiah: “Today is a day of suffering; we are being punished and are in disgrace. We are like a woman who is ready to give birth, but is too weak to do it."
Isaiah,37,4,The Assyrian emperor has sent his chief official to insult the living God. May the Lord your God hear these insults and punish those who spoke them. So pray to God for those of our people who survive.”
Isaiah,37,5,"When Isaiah received King Hezekiah's message,"
Isaiah,37,6,he sent back this answer: “The Lord tells you not to let the Assyrians frighten you by their claims that he cannot save you.
Isaiah,37,7,"The Lord will cause the emperor to hear a rumor that will make him go back to his own country, and the Lord will have him killed there.”"
Isaiah,37,8,The Assyrian official learned that the emperor had left Lachish and was fighting against the nearby city of Libnah; so he went there to consult him.
Isaiah,37,9,"Word reached the Assyrians that the Egyptian army, led by King Tirhakah of Ethiopia, was coming to attack them. When the emperor heard this, he sent a letter to King Hezekiah"
Isaiah,37,10,"of Judah to tell him: “The god you are trusting in has told you that you will not fall into my hands, but don't let that deceive you."
Isaiah,37,11,You have heard what an Assyrian emperor does to any country he decides to destroy. Do you think that you can escape?
Isaiah,37,12,"My ancestors destroyed the cities of Gozan, Haran, and Rezeph, and killed the people of Betheden who lived in Telassar, and none of their gods could save them."
Isaiah,37,13,"Where are the kings of the cities of Hamath, Arpad, Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?”"
Isaiah,37,14,"King Hezekiah took the letter from the messengers and read it. Then he went to the Temple, placed the letter there in the presence of the Lord,"
Isaiah,37,15,"and prayed,"
Isaiah,37,16,"“Almighty Lord , God of Israel, seated above the winged creatures, you alone are God, ruling all the kingdoms of the world. You created the earth and the sky."
Isaiah,37,17,"Now, Lord , hear us and look at what is happening to us. Listen to all the things that Sennacherib is saying to insult you, the living God."
Isaiah,37,18,"We all know, Lord , that the emperors of Assyria have destroyed many nations, made their lands desolate,"
Isaiah,37,19,"and burned up their gods—which were no gods at all, only images of wood and stone made by human hands."
Isaiah,37,20,"Now, Lord our God, rescue us from the Assyrians, so that all the nations of the world will know that you alone are God.”"
Isaiah,37,21,Then Isaiah sent a message telling King Hezekiah that in answer to the king's prayer
Isaiah,37,22,"the Lord had said, “The city of Jerusalem laughs at you, Sennacherib, and makes fun of you."
Isaiah,37,23,"Whom do you think you have been insulting and ridiculing? You have been disrespectful to me, the holy God of Israel."
Isaiah,37,24,"You sent your servants to boast to me that with all your chariots you had conquered the highest mountains of Lebanon. You boasted that there you cut down the tallest cedars and the finest cypress trees, and that you reached the deepest parts of the forests."
Isaiah,37,25,"You boasted that you dug wells and drank water in foreign lands, and that the feet of your soldiers tramped the Nile River dry."
Isaiah,37,26,“Have you never heard that I planned all this long ago? And now I have carried it out. I gave you the power to turn fortified cities into piles of rubble.
Isaiah,37,27,The people who lived there were powerless; they were frightened and stunned. They were like grass in a field or weeds growing on a roof when the hot east wind blasts them.
Isaiah,37,28,"“But I know everything about you, what you do and where you go. I know how you rage against me."
Isaiah,37,29,"I have received the report of that rage and that pride of yours, and now I will put a hook through your nose and a bit in your mouth and will take you back by the same road you came.”"
Isaiah,37,30,"Then Isaiah said to King Hezekiah, “Here is a sign of what will happen. This year and next you will have only wild grain to eat, but the following year you will be able to plant grain and harvest it, and plant vines and eat grapes."
Isaiah,37,31,Those in Judah who survive will flourish like plants that send roots deep into the ground and produce fruit.
Isaiah,37,32,"There will be people in Jerusalem and on Mount Zion who will survive, because the Lord Almighty is determined to make this happen."
Isaiah,37,33,"“And this is what the Lord has said about the Assyrian emperor: ‘He will not enter this city or shoot a single arrow against it. No soldiers with shields will come near the city, and no siege mounds will be built around it."
Isaiah,37,34,"He will go back by the same road he came, without entering this city. I, the Lord , have spoken."
Isaiah,37,35,"I will defend this city and protect it, for the sake of my own honor and because of the promise I made to my servant David.’”"
Isaiah,37,36,"An angel of the Lord went to the Assyrian camp and killed 185,000 soldiers. At dawn the next day there they lay, all dead!"
Isaiah,37,37,Then the Assyrian emperor Sennacherib withdrew and returned to Nineveh.
Isaiah,37,38,"One day when he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, two of his sons, Adrammelech and Sharezer, killed him with their swords and then escaped to the land of Ararat. Another of his sons, Esarhaddon, succeeded him as emperor."
Isaiah,38,1,"About this time King Hezekiah became sick and almost died. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to see him and said to him, “The Lord tells you that you are to put everything in order because you will not recover. Get ready to die.”"
Isaiah,38,2,Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed:
Isaiah,38,3,"“Remember, Lord , that I have served you faithfully and loyally, and that I have always tried to do what you wanted me to.” And he began to cry bitterly."
Isaiah,38,4,Then the Lord commanded Isaiah
Isaiah,38,5,"to go back to Hezekiah and say to him, “I, the Lord , the God of your ancestor David, have heard your prayer and seen your tears; I will let you live fifteen years longer."
Isaiah,38,6,"I will rescue you and this city of Jerusalem from the emperor of Assyria, and I will continue to protect the city.”"
Isaiah,38,7,"Isaiah replied, “The Lord will give you a sign to prove that he will keep his promise."
Isaiah,38,8,"On the stairway built by King Ahaz, the Lord will make the shadow go back ten steps.” And the shadow moved back ten steps."
Isaiah,38,9,"After Hezekiah recovered from his illness, he wrote this song of praise:"
Isaiah,38,10,"I thought that in the prime of life I was going to the world of the dead, Never to live out my life."
Isaiah,38,11,I thought that in this world of the living I would never again see the Lord Or any living person.
Isaiah,38,12,"My life was cut off and ended, Like a tent that is taken down, Like cloth that is cut from a loom. I thought that God was ending my life."
Isaiah,38,13,"All night I cried out with pain, As if a lion were breaking my bones. I thought that God was ending my life."
Isaiah,38,14,"My voice was thin and weak, And I moaned like a dove. My eyes grew tired from looking to heaven. Lord , rescue me from all this trouble."
Isaiah,38,15,"What can I say? The Lord has done this. My heart is bitter, and I cannot sleep."
Isaiah,38,16,"Lord, I will live for you, for you alone; Heal me and let me live."
Isaiah,38,17,My bitterness will turn into peace. You save my life from all danger; You forgive all my sins.
Isaiah,38,18, No one in the world of the dead can praise you; The dead cannot trust in your faithfulness.
Isaiah,38,19,"It is the living who praise you, As I praise you now. Parents tell their children how faithful you are."
Isaiah,38,20," Lord , you have healed me. We will play harps and sing your praise, Sing praise in your Temple as long as we live."
Isaiah,38,21,"Isaiah told the king to put a paste made of figs on his boil, and he would get well."
Isaiah,38,22,"Then King Hezekiah asked, “What is the sign to prove that I will be able to go to the Temple?”"
Isaiah,39,1,"About that same time the king of Babylonia, Merodach Baladan, son of Baladan, heard that King Hezekiah had been sick, so he sent him a letter and a present."
Isaiah,39,2,"Hezekiah welcomed the messengers and showed them his wealth—his silver and gold, his spices and perfumes, and all his military equipment. There was nothing in his storerooms or anywhere in his kingdom that he did not show them."
Isaiah,39,3,"Then the prophet Isaiah went to King Hezekiah and asked, “Where did these messengers come from and what did they say to you?” Hezekiah answered, “They came from a very distant country, from Babylonia.”"
Isaiah,39,4,“What did they see in the palace?” “They saw everything. There is nothing in the storerooms that I didn't show them.”
Isaiah,39,5,"Isaiah then told the king, “The Lord Almighty says that"
Isaiah,39,6,"a time is coming when everything in your palace, everything that your ancestors have stored up to this day, will be carried off to Babylonia. Nothing will be left."
Isaiah,39,7,Some of your own direct descendants will be taken away and made eunuchs to serve in the palace of the king of Babylonia.”
Isaiah,39,8,"King Hezekiah understood this to mean that there would be peace and security during his lifetime, so he replied, “The message you have given me from the Lord is good.”"
Isaiah,40,1,"“Comfort my people,” says our God. “Comfort them!"
Isaiah,40,2,Encourage the people of Jerusalem. Tell them they have suffered long enough and their sins are now forgiven. I have punished them in full for all their sins.”
Isaiah,40,3," A voice cries out, “Prepare in the wilderness a road for the Lord! Clear the way in the desert for our God!"
Isaiah,40,4,"Fill every valley; level every mountain. The hills will become a plain, and the rough country will be made smooth."
Isaiah,40,5,"Then the glory of the Lord will be revealed, and all people will see it. The Lord himself has promised this.”"
Isaiah,40,6," A voice cries out, “Proclaim a message!” “What message shall I proclaim?” I ask. “Proclaim that all human beings are like grass; they last no longer than wild flowers."
Isaiah,40,7,Grass withers and flowers fade when the Lord sends the wind blowing over them. People are no more enduring than grass.
Isaiah,40,8,"Yes, grass withers and flowers fade, but the word of our God endures forever.”"
Isaiah,40,9,"Jerusalem, go up on a high mountain and proclaim the good news! Call out with a loud voice, Zion; announce the good news! Speak out and do not be afraid. Tell the towns of Judah that their God is coming!"
Isaiah,40,10," The Sovereign Lord is coming to rule with power, bringing with him the people he has rescued."
Isaiah,40,11, He will take care of his flock like a shepherd; he will gather the lambs together and carry them in his arms; he will gently lead their mothers.
Isaiah,40,12,Can anyone measure the ocean by handfuls or measure the sky with his hands? Can anyone hold the soil of the earth in a cup or weigh the mountains and hills on scales?
Isaiah,40,13, Can anyone tell the Lord what to do? Who can teach him or give him advice?
Isaiah,40,14,With whom does God consult in order to know and understand and to learn how things should be done?
Isaiah,40,15," To the Lord the nations are nothing, no more than a drop of water; the distant islands are as light as dust."
Isaiah,40,16,"All the animals in the forests of Lebanon are not enough for a sacrifice to our God, and its trees are too few to kindle the fire."
Isaiah,40,17,The nations are nothing at all to him.
Isaiah,40,18, To whom can God be compared? How can you describe what he is like?
Isaiah,40,19,"He is not like an idol that workers make, that metalworkers cover with gold and set in a base of silver."
Isaiah,40,20, Anyone who cannot afford silver or gold chooses wood that will not rot. He finds a skillful worker to make an image that won't fall down.
Isaiah,40,21,Do you not know? Were you not told long ago? Have you not heard how the world began?
Isaiah,40,22,"It was made by the one who sits on his throne above the earth and beyond the sky; the people below look as tiny as ants. He stretched out the sky like a curtain, like a tent in which to live."
Isaiah,40,23,He brings down powerful rulers and reduces them to nothing.
Isaiah,40,24,"They are like young plants, just set out and barely rooted. When the Lord sends a wind, they dry up and blow away like straw."
Isaiah,40,25,To whom can the holy God be compared? Is there anyone else like him?
Isaiah,40,26," Look up at the sky! Who created the stars you see? The one who leads them out like an army, he knows how many there are and calls each one by name! His power is so great— not one of them is ever missing!"
Isaiah,40,27,"Israel, why then do you complain that the Lord doesn't know your troubles or care if you suffer injustice?"
Isaiah,40,28,Don't you know? Haven't you heard? The Lord is the everlasting God; he created all the world. He never grows tired or weary. No one understands his thoughts.
Isaiah,40,29,He strengthens those who are weak and tired.
Isaiah,40,30,Even those who are young grow weak; young people can fall exhausted.
Isaiah,40,31,But those who trust in the Lord for help will find their strength renewed. They will rise on wings like eagles; they will run and not get weary; they will walk and not grow weak.
Isaiah,41,1,"God says, “Be silent and listen to me, you distant lands! Get ready to present your case in court; you will have your chance to speak. Let us come together to decide who is right."
Isaiah,41,2,“Who was it that brought the conqueror from the east and makes him triumphant wherever he goes? Who gives him victory over kings and nations? His sword strikes them down as if they were dust. His arrows scatter them like straw before the wind.

Isaiah,41,24,You and all you do are nothing; those who worship you are disgusting!
Isaiah,41,25,"“I have chosen a man who lives in the east; I will bring him to attack from the north. He tramples on rulers as if they were mud, like a potter trampling clay."

Isaiah,43,8,"God says, “Summon my people to court. They have eyes, but they are blind; they have ears, but they are deaf!"

Isaiah,43,10,"“People of Israel, you are my witnesses; I chose you to be my servant, so that you would know me and believe in me and understand that I am the only God. Besides me there is no other god; there never was and never will be."
Isaiah,43,11,"“I alone am the Lord, the only one who can save you."
Isaiah,43,12,"I predicted what would happen, and then I came to your aid. No foreign god has ever done this; you are my witnesses."
Isaiah,43,13,I am God and always will be. No one can escape from my power; no one can change what I do.”

Isaiah,43,18,"But the Lord says, “Do not cling to events of the past or dwell on what happened long ago."

Isaiah,43,20,Even the wild animals will honor me; jackals and ostriches will praise me when I make rivers flow in the desert to give water to my chosen people.
Isaiah,43,21,"They are the people I made for myself, and they will sing my praises!”"
Isaiah,43,22,"The Lord says, “But you were tired of me, Israel; you did not worship me."
Isaiah,43,23,You did not bring me your burnt offerings of sheep; you did not honor me with your sacrifices. I did not burden you by demanding offerings or wear you out by asking for incense.
Isaiah,43,24,You didn't buy incense for me or satisfy me with the fat of your animals. Instead you burdened me with your sins; you wore me out with the wrongs you have committed.
Isaiah,43,25,"And yet, I am the God who forgives your sins, and I do this because of who I am. I will not hold your sins against you."
Isaiah,43,26,“Let us go to court; bring your accusation! Present your case to prove you are in the right!
Isaiah,43,27,"Your earliest ancestor sinned; your leaders sinned against me,"

Isaiah,44,6," The Lord , who rules and protects Israel, the Lord Almighty, has this to say: “I am the first, the last, the only God; there is no other god but me."

Isaiah,44,8,"Do not be afraid, my people! You know that from ancient times until now I have predicted all that would happen, and you are my witnesses. Is there any other god? Is there some powerful god I never heard of?”"
Isaiah,44,9,"All those who make idols are worthless, and the gods they prize so highly are useless. Those who worship these gods are blind and ignorant—and they will be disgraced."
Isaiah,44,10,It does no good to make a metal image to worship as a god!
Isaiah,44,11,Everyone who worships it will be humiliated. The people who make idols are human beings and nothing more. Let them come and stand trial—they will be terrified and will suffer disgrace.

Isaiah,44,15,A person uses part of a tree for fuel and part of it for making an idol. With one part he builds a fire to warm himself and bake bread; with the other part he makes a god and worships it.
Isaiah,44,16,"With some of the wood he makes a fire; he roasts meat, eats it, and is satisfied. He warms himself and says, “How nice and warm! What a beautiful fire!”"
Isaiah,44,17,"The rest of the wood he makes into an idol, and then he bows down and worships it. He prays to it and says, “You are my god—save me!”"
Isaiah,44,18,Such people are too stupid to know what they are doing. They close their eyes and their minds to the truth.
Isaiah,44,19,"The maker of idols hasn't the wit or the sense to say, “Some of the wood I burned up. I baked some bread on the coals, and I roasted meat and ate it. And the rest of the wood I made into an idol. Here I am bowing down to a block of wood!”"
Isaiah,44,20,It makes as much sense as eating ashes. His foolish ideas have so misled him that he is beyond help. He won't admit to himself that the idol he holds in his hand is not a god at all.
Isaiah,44,21,"The Lord says, “Israel, remember this; remember that you are my servant. I created you to be my servant, and I will never forget you."

Isaiah,44,26,"But when my servant makes a prediction, when I send a messenger to reveal my plans, I make those plans and predictions come true. I tell Jerusalem that people will live there again, and the cities of Judah that they will be rebuilt. Those cities will rise from the ruins."
Isaiah,44,27,With a word of command I dry up the ocean.
Isaiah,44,28," I say to Cyrus, ‘You are the one who will rule for me; you will do what I want you to do: you will order that Jerusalem be rebuilt and that the foundations of the Temple be laid.’”"
Isaiah,45,1,"The Lord has chosen Cyrus to be king. He has appointed him to conquer nations; he sends him to strip kings of their power; the Lord will open the gates of cities for him. To Cyrus the Lord says,"
Isaiah,45,2,"“I myself will prepare your way, leveling mountains and hills. I will break down bronze gates and smash their iron bars."

Isaiah,45,10,"Do we dare say to our parents, “Why did you make me like this?”"
Isaiah,45,11,"The Lord , the holy God of Israel, the one who shapes the future, says: “You have no right to question me about my children or to tell me what I ought to do!"
Isaiah,45,12,"I am the one who made the earth and created human beings to live there. By my power I stretched out the heavens; I control the sun, the moon, and the stars."
Isaiah,45,13,"I myself have stirred Cyrus to action to fulfill my purpose and put things right. I will straighten out every road that he travels. He will rebuild my city, Jerusalem, and set my captive people free. No one has hired him or bribed him to do this.” The Lord Almighty has spoken."
Isaiah,45,14,"The Lord says to Israel, “The wealth of Egypt and Ethiopia will be yours, and the tall men of Seba will be your slaves; they will follow you in chains. They will bow down to you and confess, ‘God is with you—he alone is God."

Isaiah,45,18,"The Lord created the heavens— he is the one who is God! He formed and made the earth— he made it firm and lasting. He did not make it a desolate waste, but a place for people to live. It is he who says, “I am the Lord, and there is no other god."
Isaiah,45,19,"I have not spoken in secret or kept my purpose hidden. I did not require the people of Israel to look for me in a desolate waste. I am the Lord , and I speak the truth; I make known what is right.”"
Isaiah,45,20,"The Lord says, “Come together, people of the nations, all who survive the fall of the empire; present yourselves for the trial! The people who parade with their idols of wood and pray to gods that cannot save them— those people know nothing at all!"
Isaiah,45,21,"Come and present your case in court; let the defendants consult one another. Who predicted long ago what would happen? Was it not I, the Lord , the God who saves his people? There is no other god."

Isaiah,45,23," My promise is true, and it will not be changed. I solemnly promise by all that I am: Everyone will come and kneel before me and vow to be loyal to me."

Isaiah,46,1,"“This is the end for Babylon's gods! Bel and Nebo once were worshiped, but now they are loaded on donkeys, a burden for the backs of tired animals."

Isaiah,46,5,“To whom will you compare me?” says the Lord. “Is there anyone else like me?
Isaiah,46,6,People open their purses and pour out gold; they weigh out silver on the scales. They hire a goldsmith to make a god; then they bow down and worship it.

Isaiah,47,1," The Lord says, “Babylon, come down from your throne, and sit in the dust on the ground. You were once like a virgin, a city unconquered, but you are soft and delicate no longer! You are now a slave!"

Isaiah,58,4,"Your fasting makes you violent, and you quarrel and fight. Do you think this kind of fasting will make me listen to your prayers?"
Isaiah,58,5,"When you fast, you make yourselves suffer; you bow your heads low like a blade of grass and spread out sackcloth and ashes to lie on. Is that what you call fasting? Do you think I will be pleased with that?"
Isaiah,58,6,"“The kind of fasting I want is this: Remove the chains of oppression and the yoke of injustice, and let the oppressed go free."

Isaiah,58,14,"then you will find the joy that comes from serving me. I will make you honored all over the world, and you will enjoy the land I gave to your ancestor, Jacob. I, the Lord , have spoken.”"
Isaiah,59,1,Don't think that the Lord is too weak to save you or too deaf to hear your call for help!
Isaiah,59,2,It is because of your sins that he doesn't hear you. It is your sins that separate you from God when you try to worship him.

Isaiah,65,1," The Lord said, “I was ready to answer my people's prayers, but they did not pray. I was ready for them to find me, but they did not even try. The nation did not pray to me, even though I was always ready to answer, ‘Here I am; I will help you.’"
Isaiah,65,2,"I have always been ready to welcome my people, who stubbornly do what is wrong and go their own way."
Isaiah,65,3,They shamelessly keep on making me angry. They offer pagan sacrifices at sacred gardens and burn incense on pagan altars.
Isaiah,65,4,At night they go to caves and tombs to consult the spirits of the dead. They eat pork and drink broth made from meat offered in pagan sacrifices.

Isaiah,65,16,Anyone in the land who asks for a blessing will ask to be blessed by the faithful God. Whoever takes an oath will swear by the name of the faithful God. The troubles of the past will be gone and forgotten.”
