B'midbar,1,1,"ADONAI spoke to Moshe in the Sinai Desert, in the tent of meeting, on the first day of the second month of the second year after they had left the land of Egypt. He said"
B'midbar,1,2,"“Take a census of the entire assembly of the people of Isra’el, by clans and families. Record the names of all the men"
B'midbar,1,3,twenty years old and over who are subject to military service in Isra’el. You and Aharon are to enumerate them company by company.
B'midbar,1,4,Take with you from each tribe someone who is head of a clan.
B'midbar,1,5,"These are the men to take with you:
From Re’uven, Elitzur the son of Sh’de’ur"
B'midbar,1,6,"From Shim‘on, Shlumi’el the son of Tzurishaddai"
B'midbar,1,7,"From Y’hudah, Nachshon the son of ‘Amminadav"
B'midbar,1,8,"From Yissakhar, N’tan’el the son of Tzu‘ar"
B'midbar,1,9,"From Z’vulun, Eli’av the son of Helon."
B'midbar,1,10,"Of the children of Yosef:
From Efrayim, Elishama the son of ‘Ammihud;
From M’nasheh, Gamli’el the son of P’dahtzur."
B'midbar,1,11,"From Binyamin, Avidan the son of Gid‘oni"
B'midbar,1,12,"From Dan, Achi‘ezer the son of ‘Ammishaddai"
B'midbar,1,13,"From Asher, Pag‘i’el the son of ‘Okhran"
B'midbar,1,14,"From Gad, Elyasaf the son of De‘u’el"
B'midbar,1,15,"From Naftali, Achira the son of ‘Enan.”"
B'midbar,1,16,"These were the ones called from the assembly, the chiefs of their fathers’ clans and heads of thousands in Isra’el."
B'midbar,1,17,So Moshe and Aharon took these men who had been designated by name
B'midbar,1,18,"and, on the first day of the second month, they gathered the whole assembly to state their genealogies by families and clans and recorded the names of all those twenty years old and over, as well as their total numbers."
B'midbar,1,19,"Moshe counted them in the Sinai Desert, just as ADONAI had ordered him.

B'midbar,1,20,"The men twenty years old and over who were subject to military service were recorded by name, family and clan, starting with the descendants of Re’uven, Isra’el’s firstborn. Here are the totals"
B'midbar,2,1,(iii) ADONAI said to Moshe and Aharon
B'midbar,2,2,"“The people of Isra’el are to set up camp by clans, each man with his own banner and under his clan’s symbol; they are to camp around the tent of meeting, but at a distance."

B'midbar,2,33,"But, as ADONAI ordered Moshe, the L’vi’im were not counted with the rest of Isra’el."
B'midbar,2,34,"The people of Isra’el did everything ADONAI had ordered Moshe: they set up camp under their banners, and they set out, each according to his family and clan."
B'midbar,3,1,(iv) These are the descendants of Aharon and Moshe as of the day when ADONAI spoke with Moshe on Mount Sinai.
B'midbar,3,2,"The names of the sons of Aharon are: Nadav the firstborn, Avihu, El‘azar and Itamar."
B'midbar,3,3,"These were the names of the sons of Aharon the cohen, whom he anointed and ordained as cohanim."
B'midbar,3,4,"But Nadav and Avihu died in the presence of ADONAI when they offered unauthorized fire before ADONAI in the Sinai Desert, and they had no children; El‘azar and Itamar served as cohanim in the presence of Aharon their father."
B'midbar,3,5,ADONAI said to Moshe
B'midbar,3,6,"“Summon the tribe of Levi, and assign them to Aharon the cohen, so that they can help him."
B'midbar,3,7,They are to carry out his duties and the duties of the whole community before the tent of meeting in performing the service of the tabernacle.
B'midbar,3,8,They are to be in charge of all the furnishings of the tent of meeting and to carry out all the duties of the people of Isra’el connected with the service of the tabernacle.
B'midbar,3,9,Assign the L’vi’im to Aharon and his sons; their one responsibility in regard to the people of Isra’el is to serve him.
B'midbar,3,10,You are to appoint Aharon and his sons to carry out the duties of cohanim; anyone else who involves himself is to be put to death.”
B'midbar,3,11,ADONAI said to Moshe
B'midbar,3,12,“I have taken the L’vi’im from among the people of Isra’el in lieu of every firstborn male that is first from the womb among the people of Isra’el; the L’vi’im are to be mine.
B'midbar,3,13,"All the firstborn males belong to me, because on the day that I killed all the firstborn males in the land of Egypt, I separated for myself all the firstborn males in Isra’el, both human and animal. They are mine; I am ADONAI.”
(v)"
B'midbar,3,14,ADONAI said to Moshe in the Sinai Desert
B'midbar,3,15,“Take a census of the tribe of Levi by clans and families. Count every male a month old or over.”
B'midbar,3,16,"Moshe counted them in the manner ADONAI had said, as he had been ordered."
B'midbar,3,17,"The names of the sons of Levi were Gershon, K’hat and M’rari."
B'midbar,3,18,The names of the sons of Gershon were Livni and Shim‘i; they fathered their respective clans
B'midbar,3,19,"likewise the sons of K’hat — ‘Amram,Yitz’har, Hevron and ‘Uzi’el "
B'midbar,3,20,and the sons of M’rari — Machli and Mushi. These fathered the clans of the L’vi’im.
B'midbar,3,21,Gershon fathered the clans of Livni and Shim‘i; these were the Gershon clans.
B'midbar,3,22,"Of them, 7,500 males a month old and over were counted."
B'midbar,3,23,"The Gershon clans were to camp behind the tabernacle, toward the west."
B'midbar,3,24,"The chief of the Gershon clan was Elyasaf, the son of La’el."
B'midbar,3,25,"In connection with the tent of meeting, the descendants of Gershon were to be in charge of the following: the tabernacle itself, its inner and outer coverings, the screen for the entrance of the tent of meeting"
B'midbar,3,26,"the curtains surrounding the courtyard, the screen for the entrance of the courtyard surrounding the tabernacle and the altar, all the fixtures and ropes for these items, and their maintenance."
B'midbar,3,27,"K’hat fathered the clans of ‘Amram, Yitz’har, Hevron and ‘Uzi’el; these were the K’hat clans."
B'midbar,3,28,"Of them, 8,600 males a month old and over were counted; they were in charge of the Holy Place."
B'midbar,3,29,"The K’hat clans were to camp next to the tabernacle, toward the south."
B'midbar,3,30,The chief of the K’hat clan was Elitzafan the son of ‘Uzi’el.
B'midbar,3,31,"They were responsible for the ark, the table, the menorah, the altars, the utensils the cohanim use when they serve in the Holy Place, the curtain, and everything involved with the maintenance of these things."
B'midbar,3,32,El‘azar the son of Aharon the cohen was first among the chiefs of the L’vi’im and supervised those in charge of the Holy Place.
B'midbar,3,33,M’rari fathered the clans of Machli and Mushi; these were the M’rari clans.
B'midbar,3,34,"Of them, 6,200 males a month old and over were counted."
B'midbar,3,35,"The chief of the M’rari clan was Tzuri’el the son of Avichayil. They were to camp next to the tabernacle, toward the north."
B'midbar,3,36,"The M’rari clans were assigned responsibility for the frames of the tabernacle, along with its crossbars, posts, sockets and fittings, together with their maintenance"
B'midbar,3,37,"also the posts of the surrounding courtyard, with their sockets, pegs and ropes."
B'midbar,3,38,"Those who were to camp in front of the tabernacle on the east, in front of the tent of meeting toward the sunrise, were Moshe, Aharon and his sons who were in charge of the Holy Place. They carried out their responsibility on behalf of the people of Isra’el, and anyone else who involved himself was to be put to death."
B'midbar,3,39,"The total number of L’vi’im whom Moshe and Aharon counted by their clans, all the males a month old and over, was 22,000.
(vi)"
B'midbar,3,40,"ADONAI said to Moshe, “Register all the firstborn males of the people of Isra’el a month old and over, and determine how many there are."
B'midbar,3,41,"Then you are to take the L’vi’im for me, ADONAI, in place of all the firstborn among the people of Isra’el, and the cattle of the L’vi’im in place of the firstborn of the cattle belonging to the people of Isra’el.”"
B'midbar,3,42,"Moshe counted, as ADONAI had ordered him, all the firstborn among the people of Isra’el."
B'midbar,3,43,"The total number of firstborn males registered, a month old and over, of those who were counted, was 22,273."
B'midbar,3,44,ADONAI said to Moshe
B'midbar,3,45,"“Take the L’vi’im in place of all the firstborn among the people of Isra’el, and the cattle of the L’vi’im in place of their cattle; the L’vi’im are to belong to me, ADONAI."
B'midbar,3,46,"Since there were 273 more firstborn males from Isra’el than male L’vi’im, in order to redeem them"
B'midbar,3,47,"you are to take five shekels [two ounces] for each of these (use the sanctuary shekel, which is equal to twenty gerahs)."
B'midbar,3,48,Give the redemption money for these extra people to Aharon and his sons.”
B'midbar,3,49,Moshe took the redemption money from those who were over and above those redeemed by the L’vi’im
B'midbar,3,50,"the amount of money he took from the firstborn of the people of Isra’el was 1,365 shekels, using the sanctuary shekel."
B'midbar,3,51,"Moshe gave the redemption-money to Aharon and his sons, in keeping with what ADONAI had said, as ADONAI had ordered Moshe."
B'midbar,4,1,(vii) ADONAI said to Moshe and Aharon
B'midbar,4,2,"“Take a census of the descendants of K’hat, who are among the descendants of Levi, by clans and families"
B'midbar,4,3,all those from thirty to fifty years old; these will enter the corps doing the work in the tent of meeting.
B'midbar,4,4,“Here is how the descendants of K’hat are to serve in the tent of meeting and deal with the especially holy things
B'midbar,4,5,"when the time comes to break camp, Aharon is to go in with his sons, take down the curtain which serves as a screen, and cover the ark of the testimony with it."
B'midbar,4,6,"On that they are to place a covering of fine leather, and on top of that spread an all-blue cloth. Then they are to insert the carrying-poles."
B'midbar,4,7,"On the table of showbread they are to spread a blue cloth and place on it the dishes, incense pans, offering bowls and pitchers. The perpetual bread is to remain on the table."
B'midbar,4,8,"They are to spread on these things a scarlet cloth, cover them with a covering of fine leather and insert the poles."
B'midbar,4,9,"They are to take a blue cloth and cover the menorah for the light, its lamps, its tongs, its trays and the jars used to add oil to it."
B'midbar,4,10,They are to wrap it and all its accessories in fine leather and place them on a carrying-frame.
B'midbar,4,11,"On the gold altar they are to spread a blue cloth, cover it with a covering of fine leather and insert its carrying-poles."
B'midbar,4,12,"They are to take all the utensils they use when serving in the sanctuary and put them in a blue cloth, cover them with fine leather and place them on a carrying-frame."
B'midbar,4,13,"After removing the greasy ashes from the altar, they are to spread a purple cloth over it"
B'midbar,4,14,"and place on it all the utensils required for their altar service — the fire pans, meat-hooks, shovels, basins and other utensils for the altar. Then they are to spread over it a fine leather covering and insert its carrying-poles."
B'midbar,4,15,"When Aharon and his sons have finished covering the holy furnishings and all the holy utensils, when the camp is about to move forward, then the descendants of K’hat are to come and carry them. But they are not to touch the holy things, so that they won’t die. These things are the responsibility of the descendants of K’hat in the tent of meeting."
B'midbar,4,16,"“El‘azar the son of Aharon the cohen is to be responsible for the oil for the light, the fragrant incense, the continuing grain offering and the anointing oil. He is to be in charge of the entire tabernacle and everything in it, including the sanctuary and its furnishings.”
(Maftir)"
B'midbar,4,17,ADONAI said to Moshe and Aharon
B'midbar,4,18,“Do not cut off the clan of K’hat from among the L’vi’im
B'midbar,4,19,"rather, do this for them, so that they will live and not die: when they approach the especially holy things, Aharon and his sons are to go in — and you are to assign each one his task"
B'midbar,4,20,"but the descendants of K’hat are not to go in and look at the holy things as they are being covered; if they do, they will die.”

B'midbar,4,26,"the tapestries for the courtyard, and the screen for the entrance to the courtyard by the tabernacle and around the altar, along with the ropes and all the utensils they need for their service; and they are to do the work connected with these things."
B'midbar,4,27,"Aharon and his sons are to supervise all the work of the Gershon clan in transporting loads and serving, and to assign them who is to carry what."
B'midbar,4,28,"This is how the Gershon families are to serve in the tent of meeting, and they are to be under the direction of Itamar the son of Aharon the cohen."
B'midbar,4,29,"“As for the descendants of M’rari, take a census by clans and families"

B'midbar,4,48,"yielded a total of 8,580 persons."
B'midbar,4,49,"According to ADONAI’s order they were appointed by Moshe, each one to his specific service or work. They were also enumerated, as ADONAI had ordered Moshe."
B'midbar,5,1,(iii) ADONAI said to Moshe
B'midbar,5,2,"“Order the people of Isra’el to expel from the camp everyone with tzara‘at, everyone with a discharge and whoever is unclean because of touching a corpse."
B'midbar,5,3,"Both male and female you must expel; put them outside the camp; so that they won’t defile their camp, where I live among you.”"
B'midbar,5,4,The people of Isra’el did this and put them outside the camp — the people of Isra’el did what ADONAI had said to Moshe.
B'midbar,5,5,ADONAI said to Moshe
B'midbar,5,6,"“Tell the people of Isra’el, ‘When a man or woman commits any kind of sin against another person and thus breaks faith with ADONAI, he incurs guilt."
B'midbar,5,7,"He must confess the sin which he has committed; and he must make full restitution for his guilt, add twenty percent and give it to the victim of his sin."
B'midbar,5,8,"But if the person has no relative to whom restitution can be made for the guilt, then what is given in restitution for guilt will belong to ADONAI, that is, to the cohen — in addition to the ram of atonement through which atonement is made for him."
B'midbar,5,9,“‘Every contribution which the people of Isra’el consecrate and present to the cohen will belong to him.
B'midbar,5,10,"Anything an individual consecrates will be his own [to allocate among the cohanim], but what a person gives to the cohen will belong to him.’”
(A: iv)"
B'midbar,5,11,ADONAI said to Moshe
B'midbar,5,12,"“Tell the people of Isra’el, ‘If a man’s wife goes astray and is unfaithful to him"
B'midbar,5,13,"that is, if another man goes to bed with her without her husband’s knowledge, so that she becomes impure secretly, and there is no witness against her, and she was not caught in the act"
B'midbar,5,14,"then, if a spirit of jealousy comes over him, and he is jealous of his wife, and she has become impure — or, for that matter, if the spirit of jealousy comes over him, and he is jealous of his wife, and she has not become impure "
B'midbar,5,15,"he is to bring his wife to the cohen, along with the offering for her, two quarts of barley flour on which he has not poured olive oil or put frankincense, because it is a grain offering for jealousy, a grain offering for remembering, for recalling guilt to mind."
B'midbar,5,16,The cohen will bring her forward and place her before ADONAI.
B'midbar,5,17,"The cohen will put holy water in a clay pot, and then the cohen will take some of the dust on the floor of the tabernacle and put it in the water."
B'midbar,5,18,"The cohen will place the woman before ADONAI, unbind the woman’s hair and put the grain offering for remembering in her hands, the grain offering for jealousy; while the cohen has in his hand the water of embitterment and cursing."
B'midbar,5,19,"The cohen will make her swear by saying to her, “If no man has gone to bed with you, if you have not gone astray to make yourself unclean while under your husband’s authority, then be free from this water of embitterment and cursing."
B'midbar,5,20,"But if you have in fact gone astray while under your husband’s authority and become unclean, because some man other than your husband has gone to bed with you . . .”"
B'midbar,5,21,"then the cohen is to make the woman swear with an oath that includes a curse; the cohen will say to the woman, “. . .may ADONAI make you an object of cursing and condemnation among your people by making your private parts shrivel and your abdomen swell up!"
B'midbar,5,22,"May this water that causes the curse go into your inner parts and make your abdomen swell and your private parts shrivel up!” — and the woman is to respond, “Amen! Amen!”"
B'midbar,5,23,"The cohen is to write these curses on a scroll, wash them off into the water of embitterment"
B'midbar,5,24,and make the woman drink the water of embitterment and cursing — the water of cursing will enter her and become bitter.
B'midbar,5,25,"Then the cohen is to remove the grain offering for jealousy from the woman’s hand, wave the grain offering before ADONAI and bring it to the altar."
B'midbar,5,26,"The cohen is to take a handful of the grain offering as its reminder portion and make it go up in smoke on the altar; afterwards, he is to make the woman drink the water."
B'midbar,5,27,"When he has made her drink the water, then, if she is unclean and has been unfaithful to her husband, the water that causes the curse will enter her and become bitter, so that her abdomen swells and her private parts shrivel up; and the woman will become an object of cursing among her people."
B'midbar,5,28,"But if the woman is not unclean but clean, then she will be innocent and will have children."
B'midbar,5,29,This is the law for jealousy: when either a wife under her husband’s authority goes astray and becomes unclean
B'midbar,5,30,"or the spirit of jealousy comes over a husband and he becomes jealous of his wife, then he is to place the woman before ADONAI, and the cohen is to deal with her in accordance with all of this law."
B'midbar,5,31,"The husband will be clear of guilt, but the wife will bear the consequences of her guilt.’”"
B'midbar,6,1,ADONAI said to Moshe
B'midbar,6,2,"“Tell the people of Isra’el, ‘When either a man or a woman makes a special kind of vow, the vow of a nazir, consecrating himself to ADONAI"
B'midbar,6,3,"he is to abstain from wine and other intoxicating liquor, he is not to drink vinegar from either source, he is not to drink grape juice, and he is not to eat grapes or raisins."
B'midbar,6,4,"As long as he remains a nazir he is to eat nothing derived from the grapevine, not even the grape-skins or the seeds."
B'midbar,6,5,"“‘Throughout the period of his vow as a nazir, he is not to shave his head. Until the end of the time for which he has consecrated himself to ADONAI he is to be holy: he is to let the hair on his head grow long."
B'midbar,6,6,"“‘Throughout the period for which he has consecrated himself to ADONAI, he is not to approach a corpse."
B'midbar,6,7,"He is not to make himself unclean for his father, mother, brother or sister when they die, since his consecration to God is on his head."
B'midbar,6,8,Throughout the time of his being a nazir he is holy for ADONAI.
B'midbar,6,9,"“‘If someone next to him dies very suddenly, so that he defiles his consecrated head, then he is to shave his head on the day of his purification; he is to shave it on the seventh day."
B'midbar,6,10,On the eighth day he is to bring two doves or two young pigeons to the cohen at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
B'midbar,6,11,"The cohen is to prepare one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering and thus make atonement for him, inasmuch as he sinned because of the dead person. That same day he is to re-consecrate his head"
B'midbar,6,12,"he is to consecrate to ADONAI the full period of his being a nazir by bringing a male lamb in its first year as a guilt offering. The previous days will not be counted, because his consecration became defiled."
B'midbar,6,13,“‘This is the law for the nazir when his period of consecration is over: he is to be brought to the entrance of the tent of meeting
B'midbar,6,14,"where he will present his offering to ADONAI — one male lamb in its first year without defect as a burnt offering, one female lamb in its first year without defect as a sin offering, one ram without defect as peace offerings"
B'midbar,6,15,"a basket of matzah, loaves made of fine flour mixed with olive oil, unleavened wafers spread with olive oil, their grain offering and their drink offerings."
B'midbar,6,16,"The cohen is to bring them before ADONAI, offer his sin offering, his burnt offering"
B'midbar,6,17,"and his ram as a sacrifice of peace offerings to ADONAI, with the basket of matzah. The cohen will also offer the grain offering and drink offering that go with the peace offering."
B'midbar,6,18,"The nazir will shave his consecrated head at the entrance to the tent of meeting, take the hair removed from his consecrated head and put it on the fire under the sacrifice of peace offerings."
B'midbar,6,19,"When the ram has been boiled, the cohen is to take its shoulder, one loaf of matzah from the basket and one unleavened wafer, and place them in the hands of the nazir, after he has shaved his consecrated head."
B'midbar,6,20,"The cohen is to wave them as a wave offering before ADONAI; this is set aside for the cohen, along with the breast for waving and the raised-up thigh. Following that, the nazir may drink wine."
B'midbar,6,21,"“‘This is the law for the nazir who makes a vow and for his offering to ADONAI for his being a nazir — in addition to anything more for which he has sufficient means. In keeping with whatever vow he makes, he must do it according to the law for the nazir.’”"
B'midbar,6,22,ADONAI said to Moshe
B'midbar,6,23,"“Speak to Aharon and his sons, and tell them that this is how you are to bless the people of Isra’el: you are to say to them"
B'midbar,6,24,"‘Y’varekh’kha ADONAI v’yishmerekha.
[May ADONAI bless you and keep you.]"
B'midbar,6,25,"Ya’er ADONAI panav eleikha vichunekka.
[May ADONAI make his face shine on you and show you his favor.]"
B'midbar,6,26,"Yissa ADONAI panav eleikha v’yasem l’kha shalom.
[May ADONAI lift up his face toward you and give you peace.]’"
B'midbar,6,27,"“In this way they are to put my name on the people of Isra’el, so that I will bless them.”"
B'midbar,7,1,"(A: v, S: iv) On the day Moshe finished putting up the tabernacle, he anointed and consecrated it, all its furnishings, and the altar with its utensils. After anointing and consecrating them"
B'midbar,7,2,"the leaders of Isra’el, who were heads of their father’s clans, made an offering. These were the tribal leaders in charge of those counted in the census."
B'midbar,7,3,"They brought their offering before ADONAI, six covered wagons and twelve oxen — a wagon for every two leaders and for each an ox — and presented them in front of the tabernacle."
B'midbar,7,4,ADONAI said to Moshe
B'midbar,7,5,"“Receive these from them; they are to be used for the service in the tent of meeting. Give them to the L’vi’im, to each as needed for his duties.”"
B'midbar,7,6,So Moshe took the wagons and oxen and gave them to the L’vi’im.
B'midbar,7,7,"He gave two wagons and four oxen to the descendants of Gershon, in keeping with the needs of their duties."
B'midbar,7,8,"Four wagons and eight oxen he gave to the descendants of M’rari, in keeping with the needs of their duties, directed by Itamar the son of Aharon the cohen."
B'midbar,7,9,"But to the descendants of K’hat he gave none, because their duties involved the holy articles, which they carried on their own shoulders."
B'midbar,7,10,The leaders brought the offering for dedicating the altar on the day it was anointed. The leaders brought their offering before the altar
B'midbar,7,11,"and ADONAI said to Moshe, “They are to present their offerings to dedicate the altar, each leader on his own day.”

Haftarah Naso: Shof’tim (Judges) 13:2–25
B’rit Hadashah suggested readings for Parashah Naso: Yochanan (John) 7:53–8:11; Acts 21:17–32"
B'midbar,8,1,ADONAI said to Moshe
B'midbar,8,2,"“Tell Aharon, ‘When you set up the lamps, the seven lamps are to cast their light forward, in front of the menorah.’”"
B'midbar,8,3,"Aharon did this: he lit its lamps so as to give light in front of the menorah, as ADONAI had ordered Moshe."
B'midbar,8,4,"Here is how the menorah was made: it was hammered gold from its base to its flowers, hammered work, following the pattern ADONAI had shown Moshe. This is how he made the menorah."
B'midbar,8,5,ADONAI said to Moshe
B'midbar,8,6,“Take the L’vi’im from among the people of Isra’el and cleanse them.
B'midbar,8,7,"Here is how you are to cleanse them: sprinkle the purification water on them, have them shave their whole body with a razor, and have them wash their clothes and cleanse themselves."
B'midbar,8,8,"Then they are to take a young bull with its grain offering, which is to be fine flour mixed with olive oil; while you take another bull for a sin offering."
B'midbar,8,9,"You are to present the L’vi’im in front of the tent of meeting, and assemble the entire community of the people of Isra’el."
B'midbar,8,10,"You will present the L’vi’im before ADONAI, the people of Isra’el will lay their hands on the L’vi’im"
B'midbar,8,11,"and Aharon will offer the L’vi’im before ADONAI as a wave offering from the people of Isra’el, so that they may do ADONAI’s service."
B'midbar,8,12,The L’vi’im will lay their hands on the heads of the bulls; the one you will offer as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to ADONAI to make atonement for the L’vi’im.
B'midbar,8,13,"You are to place the L’vi’im before Aharon and his sons, and offer them as a wave offering to ADONAI."
B'midbar,8,14,"In this way you will separate the L’vi’im from the people of Isra’el, and the L’vi’im will belong to me.
(ii)"
B'midbar,8,15,"“After that, the L’vi’im will enter and do the service of the tent of meeting. You will cleanse them and offer them as a wave offering"
B'midbar,8,16,"because they are entirely given to me from among the people of Isra’el; I have taken them for myself in place of all those who come first out of the womb, that is, the firstborn males of the people of Isra’el."
B'midbar,8,17,"For all the firstborn among the people of Isra’el are mine, both humans and animals; on the day I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I set them apart for myself."
B'midbar,8,18,But I have taken the L’vi’im in place of all the firstborn among the people of Isra’el
B'midbar,8,19,"and I have given the L’vi’im to Aharon and his sons from among the people of Isra’el to do the service of the people of Isra’el in the tent of meeting and to make atonement for the people of Isra’el, so that no plague will fall on the people of Isra’el in consequence of their coming too close to the sanctuary.”"
B'midbar,8,20,"This is what Moshe, Aharon and all the community of the people of Isra’el did to the L’vi’im. The people of Isra’el acted in accordance with everything that ADONAI had ordered Moshe in regard to the L’vi’im."
B'midbar,8,21,The L’vi’im purified themselves and washed their clothes. Then Aharon offered them as a holy gift before ADONAI and made atonement for them in order to cleanse them.
B'midbar,8,22,"After that, the L’vi’im came to do their service in the tent of meeting in front of Aharon and his sons; they acted in accordance with ADONAI’s orders to Moshe in regard to the L’vi’im."
B'midbar,8,23,ADONAI said to Moshe
B'midbar,8,24,"“Here are instructions concerning the L’vi’im: when they reach the age of twenty-five, they are to begin performing their duties serving in the tent of meeting"
B'midbar,8,25,"and when they reach the age of fifty, they are to stop performing this work and not serve any longer."
B'midbar,8,26,"They will assist their brothers who are performing their duties in the tent of meeting, but they themselves will not do any of the work. This is what you are to do with the L’vi’im in regard to their duties.”"
B'midbar,9,1,(iii) ADONAI spoke to Moshe in the Sinai Desert in the first month of the second year after they had left the land of Egypt; he said
B'midbar,9,2,“Let the people of Isra’el observe Pesach at its designated time.
B'midbar,9,3,"On the fourteenth day of this month, at dusk, you are to observe it — at its designated time. You are to observe it according to all its regulations and rules.”"
B'midbar,9,4,Moshe told the people of Isra’el to observe Pesach.
B'midbar,9,5,So they observed Pesach at dusk on the fourteenth day of the month in the Sinai Desert; the people of Isra’el acted in accordance with all that ADONAI had ordered Moshe.
B'midbar,9,6,"But there were certain people who had become unclean because of someone’s corpse, so that they could not observe Pesach on that day. So they came before Moshe and Aharon that day"
B'midbar,9,7,"and said to him, “We are unclean because of someone’s corpse; but why must we be kept from bringing the offering for ADONAI at the time designated for the people of Isra’el?”"
B'midbar,9,8,"Moshe answered them, “Wait, so that I can hear what ADONAI will order concerning you.”"
B'midbar,9,9,ADONAI said to Moshe
B'midbar,9,10,"“Tell the people of Isra’el, ‘If any of you now or in future generations is unclean because of a corpse, or if he is on a trip abroad, nevertheless he is to observe Pesach."
B'midbar,9,11,But he will observe it in the second month on the fourteenth day at dusk. They are to eat it with matzah and maror
B'midbar,9,12,"they are to leave none of it until morning, and they are not to break any of its bones — they are to observe it according to all the regulations of Pesach."
B'midbar,9,13,"But the person who is clean and not on a trip who fails to observe Pesach will be cut off from his people; because he did not bring the offering for ADONAI at its designated time, that person will bear the consequences of his sin."
B'midbar,9,14,"If a foreigner is staying with you and wants to observe Pesach for ADONAI, he is to do it according to the regulations and rules of Pesach — you are to have the same law for the foreigner as for the citizen of the land.’”

B'midbar,9,15,"On the day the tabernacle was put up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, that is, the tent of the testimony; and in the evening, over the tabernacle was what appeared to be fire, which remained until morning."
B'midbar,9,16,"So the cloud always covered it, and it looked like fire at night."
B'midbar,9,17,"Whenever the cloud was taken up from above the tent, the people of Isra’el continued their travels; and they camped wherever the cloud stopped."
B'midbar,9,18,"At the order of ADONAI, the people of Isra’el traveled; at the order of ADONAI, they camped; and as long as the cloud stayed over the tabernacle, they stayed in camp."
B'midbar,9,19,"Even when the cloud remained on the tabernacle for a long time, the people of Isra’el did what ADONAI had charged them to do and did not travel."
B'midbar,9,20,"Sometimes the cloud was a few days over the tabernacle; according to ADONAI’s order, they remained in camp; and according to ADONAI’s order, they traveled."
B'midbar,9,21,"Sometimes the cloud was there only from evening until morning; so that when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they traveled. Or even if it continued up both day and night, when the cloud was up, they traveled."
B'midbar,9,22,"Whether it was two days, a month or a year that the cloud remained over the tabernacle, staying on it, the people of Isra’el remained in camp and did not travel; but as soon as it was taken up, they traveled."
B'midbar,9,23,"At ADONAI’s order, they camped; and at ADONAI’s order, they traveled — they did what ADONAI had charged them to do through Moshe."
B'midbar,10,1,ADONAI said to Moshe
B'midbar,10,2,“Make two trumpets; make them of hammered silver. Use them for summoning the community and for sounding the call to break camp and move on.
B'midbar,10,3,"When they are sounded, the entire community is to assemble before you at the entrance to the tent of meeting."
B'midbar,10,4,"If only one is sounded, then just the leaders, the heads of the clans of Isra’el, are to assemble before you."
B'midbar,10,5,"“When you sound an alarm, the camps to the east will commence traveling."
B'midbar,10,6,"When you sound a second alarm, the camps to the south will set out; they will sound alarms to announce when to travel."
B'midbar,10,7,"However, when the community is to be assembled, you are to sound; but don’t sound an alarm."
B'midbar,10,8,"It will be the sons of Aharon, the cohanim, who are to sound the trumpets; this will be a permanent regulation for you through all your generations."
B'midbar,10,9,"“When you go to war in your land against an adversary who is oppressing you, you are to sound an alarm with the trumpets; then you will be remembered before ADONAI your God, and you will be saved from your enemies."
B'midbar,10,10,"“Also on your days of rejoicing, at your designated times and on Rosh-Hodesh, you are to sound the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; these will be your reminder before your God. I am ADONAI your God.”

B'midbar,10,11,"On the twentieth day of the second month of the second year, the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle of the testimony"
B'midbar,10,12,and the people of Isra’el moved out in stages from the Sinai Desert. The cloud stopped in the Pa’ran Desert.
B'midbar,10,13,"So they set out on their first journey, in keeping with ADONAI’s order through Moshe."
B'midbar,10,14,"In the lead was the banner of the camp of the descendants of Y’hudah, whose companies moved forward; over his company was Nachshon the son of ‘Amminadav."
B'midbar,10,15,Over the company of the tribe of the descendants of Yissakhar was N’tan’el the son of Tzu‘ar.
B'midbar,10,16,Over the company of the descendants of Z’vulun was Eli’av the son of Helon.
B'midbar,10,17,"Then the tabernacle was taken down; and the descendants of Gershon and the descendants of M’rari set out, carrying the tabernacle."
B'midbar,10,18,"Next, the banner of the camp of Re’uven moved forward by companies; over his company was Elitzur the son of Sh’de’ur."
B'midbar,10,19,Over the company of the tribe of the descendants of Shim‘on was Shlumi’el the son of Tzurishaddai.
B'midbar,10,20,Over the company of the descendants of Gad was Elyasaf the son of De‘u’el.
B'midbar,10,21,"Then the descendants of K’hat set out, carrying the sanctuary, so that [at the next camp] the tabernacle could be set up before they arrived."
B'midbar,10,22,The banner of the camp of the descendants of Efrayim moved forward by companies; over his company was Elishama the son of ‘Ammihud.
B'midbar,10,23,Over the company of the tribe of the descendants of M’nasheh was Gamli’el the son of P’dahtzur.
B'midbar,10,24,Over the company of the descendants of Binyamin was Avidan the son of Gid‘oni.
B'midbar,10,25,"The banner of the camp of the descendants of Dan, forming the rearguard for all the camps, moved forward by companies; over his company was Achi‘ezer the son of ‘Ammishaddai."
B'midbar,10,26,Over the company of the tribe of the descendants of Asher was Pag‘i’el the son of ‘Okhran.
B'midbar,10,27,Over the company of the descendants of Naftali was Achira the son of ‘Enan.
B'midbar,10,28,"This is how the people of Isra’el traveled by companies; thus they moved forward.
(S: vi)"
B'midbar,10,29,"Moshe said to Hovav the son of Re‘u’el the Midyani, Moshe’s father-in-law, “We are traveling to the place about which ADONAI said, ‘I will give it to you.’ Come with us, and we will treat you well, because ADONAI has promised good things to Isra’el.”"
B'midbar,10,30,"But he replied, “I will not go; I would rather go back to my own country and my own kinsmen.”"
B'midbar,10,31,"Moshe continued, “Please don’t leave us, because you know that we have to camp in the desert, and you can serve as our eyes."
B'midbar,10,32,"If you do go with us, then whatever good ADONAI does for us, we will do the same for you.”"
B'midbar,10,33,"So they set out from ADONAI’s mountain and traveled for three days. Ahead of them on this three-day journey went the ark of ADONAI’s covenant, searching for a new place to stop."
B'midbar,10,34,The cloud of ADONAI was over them during the day as they set out from the camp. (A: vi)
B'midbar,10,35,"When the ark moved forward, Moshe said,
“Arise, ADONAI! May your enemies be scattered!
Let those who hate you flee before you!”"
B'midbar,10,36,"When it stopped, he said,
“Return, ADONAI of the many, many
thousands of Isra’el!”"
B'midbar,11,1,"But the people began complaining about their hardships to ADONAI. When ADONAI heard it, his anger flared up, so that fire from ADONAI broke out against them and consumed the outskirts of the camp."
B'midbar,11,2,"Then the people cried to Moshe, Moshe prayed to ADONAI, and the fire abated."
B'midbar,11,3,That place was called Tav‘erah [burning] because ADONAI’s fire broke out against them.
B'midbar,11,4,"Next, the mixed crowd that was with them grew greedy for an easier life; while the people of Isra’el, for their part, also renewed their weeping and said, “If only we had meat to eat!"
B'midbar,11,5,"We remember the fish we used to eat in Egypt — it cost us nothing! — and the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, the garlic!"
B'midbar,11,6,"But now we’re withering away, we have nothing to look at but this man.”"
B'midbar,11,7,"The man, by the way, was like coriander seed and white like gum resin."
B'midbar,11,8,The people would go around gathering it and would grind it up in mills or pound it to paste with mortar and pestle. Then they would cook it in pots and make it into loaves that tasted like cakes baked with olive oil.
B'midbar,11,9,"When the dew settled on the camp during the night, the man came with it."
B'midbar,11,10,"Moshe heard the people crying, family after family, each person at the entrance to his tent; the anger of ADONAI flared up violently; and Moshe too was displeased."
B'midbar,11,11,"Moshe asked ADONAI, “Why are you treating your servant so badly? Why haven’t I found favor in your sight, so that you put the burden of this entire people on me?"
B'midbar,11,12,"Did I conceive this people? Was I their father, so that you tell me, ‘Carry them in your arms, like a nurse carrying a baby, to the land you swore to their ancestors?’"
B'midbar,11,13,"Where am I going to get meat to give to this entire people? — because they keep bothering me with their crying and saying, ‘Give us meat to eat!’"
B'midbar,11,14,I can’t carry this entire people by myself alone — it’s too much for me!
B'midbar,11,15,"If you are going to treat me this way, then just kill me outright! — please, if you have any mercy toward me! — and don’t let me go on being this miserable!”"
B'midbar,11,16,"ADONAI said to Moshe, “Bring me seventy of the leaders of Isra’el, people you recognize as leaders of the people and officers of theirs. Bring them to the tent of meeting, and have them stand there with you."
B'midbar,11,17,"I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take some of the Spirit which rests on you and put it on them. Then they will carry the burden of the people along with you, so that you won’t carry it yourself alone."
B'midbar,11,18,"“Tell the people, ‘Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, and you will eat meat; because you cried in the ears of ADONAI, “If only we had meat to eat! We had the good life in Egypt!” All right, ADONAI is going to give you meat, and you will eat it."
B'midbar,11,19,"You won’t eat it just one day, or two days, or five, or ten, or twenty days"
B'midbar,11,20,"but a whole month! — until it comes out of your nose and you hate it! — because you have rejected ADONAI, who is here with you, and distressed him with your crying and asking, “Why did we ever leave Egypt?”’”"
B'midbar,11,21,"But Moshe said, “Here I am with six hundred thousand men on foot, and yet you say, ‘I will give them meat to eat for a whole month!’"
B'midbar,11,22,"If whole flocks and herds were slaughtered for them, would it be enough? If all the fish in the sea were collected for them, would even that be enough?”"
B'midbar,11,23,"ADONAI answered Moshe, “Has ADONAI’s arm grown short? Now you will see whether what I said will happen or not!”"
B'midbar,11,24,Moshe went out and told the people what ADONAI had said. Then he collected seventy of the leaders of the people and placed them all around the tent.
B'midbar,11,25,"ADONAI came down in the cloud, spoke to him, took some of the Spirit that was on him and put it on the seventy leaders. When the Spirit came to rest on them, they prophesied — then but not afterwards."
B'midbar,11,26,"There were two men who stayed in the camp, one named Eldad and the other Medad, and the Spirit came to rest on them. They were among those listed to go out to the tent, but they hadn’t done so, and they prophesied in the camp."
B'midbar,11,27,"A young man ran and told Moshe, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp!”"
B'midbar,11,28,"Y’hoshua, the son of Nun, who from his youth up had been Moshe’s assistant, answered, “My lord, Moshe, stop them!”"
B'midbar,11,29,"But Moshe replied, “Are you so zealous to protect me? I wish all of ADONAI’s people were prophets! I wish ADONAI would put his Spirit on all of them!”
(vii)"
B'midbar,11,30,Moshe and the leaders of Isra’el went back into the camp
B'midbar,11,31,"and ADONAI sent out a wind which brought quails from across the sea and let them fall near the camp, about a day’s trip away on each side of the camp and all around it, covering the ground to a depth of three feet."
B'midbar,11,32,"The people stayed up all that day, all night and all the next day gathering the quails — the person gathering the least collected ten heaps; then they spread them out for themselves all around the camp."
B'midbar,11,33,"But while the meat was still in their mouth, before they had chewed it up, the anger of ADONAI flared up against the people, and ADONAI struck the people with a terrible plague."
B'midbar,11,34,"Therefore that place was named Kivrot-HaTa’avah [graves of greed], because there they buried the people who were so greedy."
B'midbar,11,35,"From Kivrot-HaTa’avah the people traveled to Hatzerot, and they stayed at Hatzerot."
B'midbar,12,1,"Miryam and Aharon began criticizing Moshe on account of the Ethiopian woman he had married, for he had in fact married an Ethiopian woman."
B'midbar,12,2,"They said, “Is it true that ADONAI has spoken only with Moshe? Hasn’t he spoken with us too?” ADONAI heard them."
B'midbar,12,3,"Now this man Moshe was very humble, more so than anyone on earth."
B'midbar,12,4,"Suddenly ADONAI told Moshe, Aharon and Miryam, “Come out, you three, to the tent of meeting.” The three of them went out."
B'midbar,12,5,"ADONAI came down in a column of cloud and stood at the entrance to the tent. He summoned Aharon and Miryam, and they both went forward."
B'midbar,12,6,"He said, “Listen to what I say: when there is a prophet among you, I, ADONAI, make myself known to him in a vision, I speak with him in a dream."
B'midbar,12,7,But it isn’t that way with my servant Moshe. He is the only one who is faithful in my entire household.
B'midbar,12,8,"With him I speak face to face and clearly, not in riddles; he sees the image of ADONAI. So why weren’t you afraid to criticize my servant Moshe?”"
B'midbar,12,9,"The anger of ADONAI flared up against them, and he left."
B'midbar,12,10,"But when the cloud was removed from above the tent, Miryam had tzara‘at, as white as snow. Aharon looked at Miryam, and she was as white as snow."
B'midbar,12,11,"Aharon said to Moshe, “Oh, my lord, please don’t punish us for this sin we committed so foolishly."
B'midbar,12,12,"Please don’t let her be like a stillborn baby, with its body half eaten away when it comes out of its mother’s womb!”"
B'midbar,12,13,"Moshe cried to ADONAI, “Oh God, I beg you, please, heal her!” (Maftir)"
B'midbar,12,14,"ADONAI answered Moshe, “If her father had merely spit in her face, wouldn’t she hide herself in shame for seven days? So let her be shut out of the camp for seven days; after that, she can be brought back in.”"
B'midbar,12,15,"Miryam was shut out of the camp seven days, and the people did not travel until she was brought back in."
B'midbar,12,16,"Afterwards, the people went on from Hatzerot and camped in the Pa’ran Desert.
Haftarah B’ha‘alotkha: Z’kharyah (Zechariah) 2:14 – 4:7
B’rit Hadashah suggested readings for Parashah B’ha‘alotkha: Yochanan (John) 19:31–37; Messianic Jews (Hebrews) 3:1–6"
B'midbar,13,1,ADONAI said to Moshe
B'midbar,13,2,"“Send men on your behalf to reconnoiter the land of Kena‘an, which I am giving to the people of Isra’el. From each ancestral tribe send someone who is a leader in his tribe.”"
B'midbar,13,3,Moshe dispatched them from the Pa’ran Desert as ADONAI had ordered; all of them were leading men among the people of Isra’el.
B'midbar,13,4,"Here are their names:
from the tribe of Re’uven, Shamua the son of Zakur"
B'midbar,13,5,"from the tribe of Shim‘on, Shafat the son of Hori"
B'midbar,13,6,"from the tribe of Y’hudah, Kalev the son of Y’funeh"
B'midbar,13,7,"from the tribe of Yissakhar, Yig’al the son of Yosef"
B'midbar,13,8,"from the tribe of Efrayim, Hoshea the son of Nun"
B'midbar,13,9,"from the tribe of Binyamin, Palti the son of Rafu"
B'midbar,13,10,"from the tribe of Z’vulun, Gadi’el the son of Sodi"
B'midbar,13,11,"from the tribe of Yosef, that is, from the tribe of M’nasheh, Gadi the son of Susi"
B'midbar,13,12,"from the tribe of Dan, ‘Ammi’el the son of G’malli"
B'midbar,13,13,"from the tribe of Asher, S’tur the son of Mikha’el"
B'midbar,13,14,"from the tribe of Naftali, Nachbi the son of Vofsi; and"
B'midbar,13,15,"from the tribe of Gad, Ge’u’el the son of Makhi."
B'midbar,13,16,These are the names of the men Moshe sent out to reconnoiter the land. Moshe gave to Hoshea the son of Nun the name Y’hoshua.
B'midbar,13,17,"Moshe sent them to reconnoiter the land of Kena‘an, instructing them, “Go on up to the Negev and into the hills"
B'midbar,13,18,"and see what the land is like. Notice the people living there, whether they are strong or weak, few or many"
B'midbar,13,19,"and what kind of country they live in, whether it is good or bad; and what kind of cities they live in, open or fortified."
B'midbar,13,20,"See whether the land is fertile or unproductive and whether there is wood in it or not. Finally, be bold enough to bring back some of the fruit of the land.”
When they left it was the season for the first grapes to ripen. (ii)"
B'midbar,13,21,They went up and reconnoitered the land from the Tzin Desert to Rechov near the entrance to Hamat.
B'midbar,13,22,"They went up into the Negev and arrived at Hevron; Achiman, Sheshai and Talmai, the ‘Anakim, lived there. (Hevron was built seven years before Tzo‘an in Egypt.)"
B'midbar,13,23,"They came to the Eshkol Valley; and there they cut off a branch bearing one cluster of grapes, which they carried on a pole between two of them; they also took pomegranates and figs."
B'midbar,13,24,"That place was called the Valley of Eshkol [cluster], because of the cluster which the people of Isra’el cut down there."
B'midbar,13,25,"Forty days later, they returned from reconnoitering the land"
B'midbar,13,26,"and went to Moshe, Aharon and the entire community of the people of Isra’el at Kadesh in the Pa’ran Desert, where they brought back word to them and to the entire community and showed them the fruit of the land."
B'midbar,13,27,"What they told him was this: “We entered the land where you sent us, and indeed it does flow with milk and honey — here is its fruit!"
B'midbar,13,28,"However the people living in the land are fierce, and the cities are fortified and very large. Moreover, we saw the ‘Anakim there."
B'midbar,13,29,"‘Amalek lives in the area of the Negev; the Hitti, the Y’vusi and the Emori live in the hills; and the Kena‘ani live by the sea and alongside the Yarden.”"
B'midbar,13,30,"Kalev silenced the people around Moshe and said, “We ought to go up immediately and take possession of it; there is no question that we can conquer it.”"
B'midbar,13,31,"But the men who had gone with him said, “We can’t attack those people, because they are stronger than we are”"
B'midbar,13,32,"and they spread a negative report about the land they had reconnoitered for the people of Isra’el by saying, “The land we passed through in order to spy it out is a land that devours its inhabitants. All the people we saw there were giant!"
B'midbar,13,33,"We saw the N’filim, the descendants of ‘Anak, who was from the N’filim; to ourselves we looked like grasshoppers by comparison, and we looked that way to them too!”"
B'midbar,14,1,At this all the people of Isra’el cried out in dismay and wept all night long.
B'midbar,14,2,"Moreover, all the people of Isra’el began grumbling against Moshe and Aharon; the whole community told them, “We wish we had died in the land of Egypt! or that we had died here in the desert!"
B'midbar,14,3,"Why is ADONAI bringing us to this land, where we will die by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will be taken as booty! Wouldn’t it be better for us to return to Egypt?”"
B'midbar,14,4,"And they said to each other, “Let’s appoint a leader and return to Egypt!”"
B'midbar,14,5,Moshe and Aharon fell on their faces before the entire assembled community of the people of Isra’el.
B'midbar,14,6,"Y’hoshua the son of Nun and Kalev the son of Y’funeh, from the detachment that had reconnoitered the land, tore their clothes"
B'midbar,14,7,"and said to the whole community of Isra’el, “The land we passed through in order to spy it out is an outstandingly good land! (iii)"
B'midbar,14,8,"If ADONAI is pleased with us, then he will bring us into this land and give it to us — a land flowing with milk and honey."
B'midbar,14,9,"Just don’t rebel against ADONAI. And don’t be afraid of the people living in the land — we’ll eat them up! Their defense has been taken away from them, and ADONAI is with us! Don’t be afraid of them!”"
B'midbar,14,10,"But just as the whole community were saying they should be stoned to death, the glory of ADONAI appeared in the tent of meeting to all the people of Isra’el."
B'midbar,14,11,"ADONAI said to Moshe, “How much longer is this people going to treat me with contempt? How much longer will they not trust me, especially considering all the signs I have performed among them?"
B'midbar,14,12,"I am going to strike them with sickness, destroy them and make from you a nation greater and stronger than they are!”"
B'midbar,14,13,"However, Moshe replied to ADONAI, “When the Egyptians hear about this — [and they will,] because it was from among them that you, by your strength, brought this people up "
B'midbar,14,14,"they will tell the people living in this land. They have heard that you, ADONAI, are with this people; that you, ADONAI, are seen face to face; that your cloud stands over them; that you go ahead of them in a column of cloud by day and a column of fire by night."
B'midbar,14,15,"If you kill off this people at a single stroke, then the nations that have heard of your reputation will say"
B'midbar,14,16,that the reason ADONAI slaughtered this people in the desert is that he wasn’t able to bring them into the land which he swore to give them.
B'midbar,14,17,"So now, please, let Adonai’s power be as great as when you said"
B'midbar,14,18,"‘ADONAI is slow to anger, rich in grace, forgiving offenses and crimes; yet not exonerating the guilty, but causing the negative effects of the parents’ offenses to be experienced by their children and even by the third and fourth generations.’"
B'midbar,14,19,"Please! Forgive the offense of this people according to the greatness of your grace, just as you have borne with this people from Egypt until now.”"
B'midbar,14,20,"ADONAI answered, “I have forgiven, as you have asked."
B'midbar,14,21,"But as sure as I live, and that the whole earth is filled with the glory of ADONAI"
B'midbar,14,22,"none of the people who saw my glory and the signs I did in Egypt and in the desert, yet tested me these ten times and did not listen to my voice"
B'midbar,14,23,will see the land I swore to their ancestors! None of those who treated me with contempt will see it.
B'midbar,14,24,"But my servant Kalev, because he had a different Spirit with him and has fully followed me — him I will bring into the land he entered, and it will belong to his descendants."
B'midbar,14,25,"“Now, since the ‘Amaleki and the Kena‘ani are living in the valley, tomorrow turn around and get yourselves into the desert along the way to the Sea of Suf.”
(iv)"
B'midbar,14,26,ADONAI said to Moshe and Aharon
B'midbar,14,27,"“How long am I to put up with this evil community who keep grumbling about me? I have heard the complaints of the people of Isra’el, which they continue to raise against me."
B'midbar,14,28,"Tell them this: ‘As surely as I live, ADONAI swears, as surely as you have spoken in my ears, I will do this to you"
B'midbar,14,29,"your carcasses will fall in this desert! Every single one of you who were included in the census over the age of twenty, you who have complained against me"
B'midbar,14,30,will certainly not enter the land about which I raised my hand to swear that I would have you live in it — except for Kalev the son of Y’funeh and Y’hoshua the son of Nun.
B'midbar,14,31,"But your little ones, who you said would be taken as booty — them I will bring in. They will know the land you have rejected."
B'midbar,14,32,"But you, your carcasses will fall in this desert"
B'midbar,14,33,and your children will wander about in the desert for forty years bearing the consequences of your prostitutions until the desert eats up your carcasses.
B'midbar,14,34,"It will be a year for every day you spent reconnoitering the land that you will bear the consequences of your offenses — forty days, forty years. Then you will know what it means to oppose me!"
B'midbar,14,35,"I, ADONAI, have spoken.’ I will certainly do this to this whole evil community who have assembled together against me — they will be destroyed in this desert and die there.”"
B'midbar,14,36,"The men whom Moshe had sent to reconnoiter the land and who, when they returned, made the entire community complain against him by giving an unfavorable report about the land "
B'midbar,14,37,those men who gave the unfavorable report about the land died by the plague in the presence of ADONAI.
B'midbar,14,38,"Of the men who went to reconnoiter the land, only Y’hoshua the son of Nun and Kalev the son of Y’funeh remained alive."
B'midbar,14,39,"When Moshe told these things to all the people of Isra’el, the people felt great remorse."
B'midbar,14,40,"They arose early the next morning, came up to the top of the mountain and said, “Here we are, and we did sin, but now we’ll go up to the place ADONAI promised.”"
B'midbar,14,41,"Moshe answered, “Why are you opposing what ADONAI said? You won’t succeed!"
B'midbar,14,42,"Don’t go up there, because ADONAI isn’t with you. If you do, your enemies will defeat you."
B'midbar,14,43,"The ‘Amalekim and the Kena‘anim are there ahead of you, and you will be struck down by the sword. The reason will be that you have turned away from following ADONAI, so that ADONAI won’t be with you.”"
B'midbar,14,44,"But they were presumptuous and went on up toward the high parts of the hill-country, even though the ark for the covenant of ADONAI — and Moshe — stayed in the camp."
B'midbar,14,45,"So the ‘Amalekim and the Kena‘anim living in that hill-country descended, struck them down and beat them back all the way to Hormah."
B'midbar,15,1,ADONAI said to Moshe
B'midbar,15,2,"“Tell the people of Isra’el, ‘When you have come into the land where you are going to live, which I am giving to you"
B'midbar,15,3,"and want to make an offering by fire to ADONAI — a burnt offering or sacrifice to fulfill a special vow, or to be a voluntary offering, or at your designated times, to make a fragrant aroma for ADONAI — then, whether it is comes from the herd or from the flock"
B'midbar,15,4,the person bringing the offering is to present ADONAI with a grain offering consisting of two quarts of fine flour mixed with one quart of olive oil
B'midbar,15,5,and one quart of wine for the drink offering. This is what you are to prepare with the burnt offering or for each lamb sacrificed.
B'midbar,15,6,"“‘For a ram, prepare one gallon of fine flour mixed with one-and-one-third quarts of olive oil"
B'midbar,15,7,"while for the drink offering, you are to present one-and-one-third quarts of wine as a fragrant aroma for ADONAI.
(v)"
B'midbar,15,8,"“‘When you prepare a bull as a burnt offering, as a sacrifice to fulfill a special vow or as peace offerings for ADONAI"
B'midbar,15,9,there is to be presented with the bull a grain offering of one-and-a-half gallons of fine flour mixed with two quarts of olive oil.
B'midbar,15,10,"For the drink offering, present two quarts of wine for an offering made by fire, a fragant aroma for ADONAI."
B'midbar,15,11,"“‘Do it this way for each bull, ram, male lamb or kid."
B'midbar,15,12,"For as many animals as you prepare, do this for each one, regardless of how many animals there are."
B'midbar,15,13,“‘Every citizen is to do these things in this way when presenting an offering made by fire as a fragrant aroma for ADONAI.
B'midbar,15,14,"If a foreigner stays with you — or whoever may be with you, through all your generations — and he wants to bring an offering made by fire as a fragrant aroma for ADONAI, he is to do the same as you."
B'midbar,15,15,For this community there will be the same law for you as for the foreigner living with you; this is a permanent regulation through all your generations; the foreigner is to be treated the same way before ADONAI as yourselves.
B'midbar,15,16,"The same Torah and standard of judgment will apply to both you and the foreigner living with you.’”
(vi)"
B'midbar,15,17,ADONAI said to Moshe
B'midbar,15,18,"“Speak to the people of Isra’el; tell them, ‘When you enter the land where I am bringing you"
B'midbar,15,19,"and eat bread produced in the land, you are to set aside a portion as a gift for ADONAI."
B'midbar,15,20,Set aside from your first dough a cake as a gift; set it aside as you would set aside a portion of the grain from the threshing-floor.
B'midbar,15,21,From your first dough you will give ADONAI a portion as a gift through all your generations.
B'midbar,15,22,“‘If by mistake you fail to observe all these mitzvot that ADONAI has spoken to Moshe
B'midbar,15,23,"yes, everything that ADONAI has ordered you to do through Moshe, from the day ADONAI gave the order and onward through all your generations"
B'midbar,15,24,"then, if it was done by mistake by the community and was not known to them, the whole community is to offer one young bull for a burnt offering as a fragrant aroma to ADONAI, with its grain and drink offerings, in keeping with the rule, and one male goat as a sin offering."
B'midbar,15,25,"The cohen is to make atonement for the whole community of the people of Isra’el; and they will be forgiven; because it was a mistake; and they have brought their offering, an offering made by fire, to ADONAI, and their sin offering before ADONAI for their mistake."
B'midbar,15,26,"The whole community of the people of Isra’el will be forgiven, likewise the foreigner staying with them; because for all the people it was a mistake.

B'midbar,15,27,"“‘If an individual sins by mistake, he is to offer a female goat in its first year as a sin offering."
B'midbar,15,28,"The cohen will make atonement before ADONAI for the person who makes a mistake by sinning inadvertently; he will make atonement for him, and he will be forgiven "
B'midbar,15,29,no matter whether he is a citizen of Isra’el or a foreigner living with them. You are to have one law for whoever it is that does something wrong by mistake.
B'midbar,15,30,"“‘But an individual who does something wrong intentionally, whether a citizen or a foreigner, is blaspheming ADONAI. That person will be cut off from his people."
B'midbar,15,31,"Because he has had contempt for the word of ADONAI and has disobeyed his command, that person will be cut off completely; his offense will remain with him.’”"
B'midbar,15,32,"While the people of Isra’el were in the desert, they found a man gathering wood on Shabbat."
B'midbar,15,33,"Those who found him gathering wood brought him to Moshe, Aharon and the whole congregation."
B'midbar,15,34,"They kept him in custody, because it had not yet been decided what to do to him."
B'midbar,15,35,"Then ADONAI said to Moshe, “This man must be put to death; the entire community is to stone him to death outside the camp.”"
B'midbar,15,36,"So the whole community brought him outside the camp and threw stones at him until he died, as ADONAI had ordered Moshe.
(Maftir)"
B'midbar,15,37,ADONAI said to Moshe
B'midbar,15,38,"“Speak to the people of Isra’el, instructing them to make, through all their generations, tzitziyot on the corners of their garments, and to put with the tzitzit on each corner a blue thread."
B'midbar,15,39,"It is to be a tzitzit for you to look at and thereby remember all of ADONAI’s mitzvot and obey them, so that you won’t go around wherever your own heart and eyes lead you to prostitute yourselves"
B'midbar,15,40,but it will help you remember and obey all my mitzvot and be holy for your God.
B'midbar,15,41,"I am ADONAI your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt in order to be your God. I am ADONAI your God.”

B’rit Hadashah suggested reading for Parashah Shlach L’kha: Messianic Jews (Hebrews) 3:7–19"
B'midbar,16,1,"Now Korach the son of Yitz’har, the son of K’hat, the son of Levi, along with Datan and Aviram, the sons of Eli’av, and On, the son of Pelet, descendants of Re’uven, took men and"
B'midbar,16,2,"rebelled against Moshe. Siding with them were 250 men of Isra’el, leaders of the community, key members of the council, men of reputation."
B'midbar,16,3,"They assembled themselves against Moshe and Aharon and said to them, “You take too much on yourselves! After all, the entire community is holy, every one of them, and ADONAI is among them. So why do you lift yourselves up above ADONAI’s assembly?”"
B'midbar,16,4,When Moshe heard this he fell on his face.
B'midbar,16,5,"Then he said to Korach and his whole group, “In the morning, ADONAI will show who are his and who is the holy person he will allow to approach him. Yes, he will bring whomever he chooses near to himself."
B'midbar,16,6,"Do this: take censers, Korach and all your group"
B'midbar,16,7,"put fire in them; and put incense in them before ADONAI tomorrow. The one whom ADONAI chooses will be the one who is holy! It is you, you sons of Levi, who are taking too much on yourselves!”"
B'midbar,16,8,"Then Moshe said to Korach, “Listen here, you sons of Levi!"
B'midbar,16,9,"Is it for you a mere trifle that the God of Isra’el has separated you from the community of Isra’el to bring you close to himself, so that you can do the work in the tabernacle of ADONAI and stand before the community serving them?"
B'midbar,16,10,He has brought you close and all your brothers the sons of Levi with you. Now you want the office of cohen too!
B'midbar,16,11,"That’s why you and your group have gathered together against ADONAI! After all, what is Aharon that you complain against him?”"
B'midbar,16,12,"Then Moshe sent to summon Datan and Aviram, the sons of Eli’av. But they replied, “We won’t come up!"
B'midbar,16,13,"Is it such a mere trifle, bringing us up from a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the desert, that now you arrogate to yourself the role of dictator over us? (ii)"
B'midbar,16,14,"You haven’t at all brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, and you haven’t put us in possession of fields and vineyards. Do you think you can gouge out these men’s eyes and blind them? We won’t come up!”"
B'midbar,16,15,"Moshe was very angry and said to ADONAI, “Don’t accept their grain offering! I haven’t taken one donkey from them, I’ve done nothing wrong to any of them.”"
B'midbar,16,16,"Moshe said to Korach, “You and your group, be there before ADONAI tomorrow — you, they and Aharon."
B'midbar,16,17,"Each of you take his fire pan and put incense in it; every one of you, bring before ADONAI his fire pan, 250 fire pans, you too, and Aharon — each one his fire pan.”"
B'midbar,16,18,"Each man took his fire pan, put fire in it, laid incense on it and stood at the entrance to the tent of meeting with Moshe and Aharon."
B'midbar,16,19,"Korach assembled all the group who were against them at the entrance to the tent of meeting. Then the glory of ADONAI appeared to the whole assembly.
(iii)"
B'midbar,16,20,ADONAI said to Moshe and Aharon
B'midbar,16,21,“Separate yourselves from this assembly; I’m going to destroy them right now!”
B'midbar,16,22,"They fell on their faces and said, “Oh God, God of the spirits of all humankind, if one person sins, are you going to be angry with the entire assembly?”"
B'midbar,16,23,ADONAI answered Moshe
B'midbar,16,24,"“Tell the assembly to move away from the homes of Korach, Datan and Aviram.”"
B'midbar,16,25,"Moshe got up and went to Datan and Aviram, and the leaders of Isra’el followed him."
B'midbar,16,26,"There he said to the assembly, “Leave the tents of these wicked men! Don’t touch anything that belongs to them, or you may be swept away in all their sins.”"
B'midbar,16,27,"So they moved away from all around the area where Korach, Datan and Aviram lived.
Then Datan and Aviram came out and stood at the entrance to their tents with their wives, sons and little ones."
B'midbar,16,28,"Moshe said, “Here is how you will know that ADONAI has sent me to do all these things and that I haven’t done them out of my own ambition"
B'midbar,16,29,"if these men die a natural death like other people, only sharing the fate common to all humanity, then ADONAI has not sent me."
B'midbar,16,30,"But if ADONAI does something new — if the ground opens up and swallows them with everything they own, and they go down alive to Sh’ol — then you will understand that these men have had contempt for ADONAI.”"
B'midbar,16,31,"The moment he finished speaking, the ground under them split apart "
B'midbar,16,32,"the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up with their households, all the people who had sided with Korach and everything they owned."
B'midbar,16,33,"So they and everything they owned went down alive into Sh’ol, the earth closed over them and their existence in the community ceased."
B'midbar,16,34,"All Isra’el around them fled at their shrieks, shouting, “The earth might swallow us too!”"
B'midbar,16,35,Then fire came out from ADONAI and destroyed the 250 men who had offered the incense.
B'midbar,17,1,ADONAI said to Moshe
B'midbar,17,2,"“Tell El‘azar the son of Aharon the cohen to remove the fire pans from the fire, and scatter the smoldering coals at a distance, because they have become holy."
B'midbar,17,3,"Also the fire pans of these men, whose sin cost them their lives, have become holy, because they were offered before ADONAI. Therefore, have them hammered into plates to cover the altar. This will be a sign for the people of Isra’el.”"
B'midbar,17,4,"El‘azar the cohen took the brass fire pans which the men who had been burned to death had offered, and they hammered them into a covering for the altar"
B'midbar,17,5,"to remind the people of Isra’el that an ordinary person, not descended from Aharon, is not to approach and burn incense before ADONAI, if he wants to avoid the fate of Korach and his group — as ADONAI had said to him through Moshe."
B'midbar,17,6,"But the very next day, the whole community of the people of Isra’el complained against Moshe and Aharon: “You have killed ADONAI’s people!”"
B'midbar,17,7,"However, as the community was assembling against Moshe and Aharon, they looked in the direction of the tent of meeting and saw the cloud cover it and the glory of ADONAI appear."
B'midbar,17,8,"Moshe and Aharon came to the front of the tent of meeting.
(iv)"
B'midbar,17,9,ADONAI said to Moshe
B'midbar,17,10,"“Get away from this assembly, and I will destroy them at once!” But they fell on their faces."
B'midbar,17,11,"Moshe said to Aharon, “Take your fire pan, put fire from the altar in it, lay incense on it, and hurry with it to the assembly to make atonement for them, because anger has gone out from ADONAI, and the plague has already begun!”"
B'midbar,17,12,"Aharon took it, as Moshe had said, and ran into the middle of the assembly. There the plague had already begun among the people, but he added the incense and made atonement for the people."
B'midbar,17,13,"He stood between the dead and the living, and the plague was stopped."
B'midbar,17,14,"Those dying from the plague numbered 14,700 — besides those who died in the Korach incident."
B'midbar,17,15,"Aharon returned to Moshe at the entrance to the tent of meeting, and the plague was stopped.
(v)"
B'midbar,17,16,ADONAI said to Moshe
B'midbar,17,17,"“Speak to the people of Isra’el, and take from them staffs, one for each ancestral tribe from each leader of a tribe, twelve staffs. Write each man’s name on his staff"
B'midbar,17,18,"and write Aharon’s name on the staff of Levi, for each tribe’s leader is to have one staff."
B'midbar,17,19,"Put them in the tent of meeting in front of the testimony, where I meet with you."
B'midbar,17,20,The staff of the man I am going to choose will sprout buds — in this way I will put a stop to the complaints the people of Isra’el keep making against you.”
B'midbar,17,21,"Moshe spoke to the people of Isra’el, and all their leaders gave him staffs, one for each leader, according to their ancestral tribes, twelve staffs. Aharon’s staff was among their staffs."
B'midbar,17,22,Moshe put the staffs before ADONAI in the tent of the testimony.
B'midbar,17,23,"The next day Moshe went into the tent of the testimony, and there he saw that Aharon’s staff for the house of Levi had budded — it had sprouted not only buds but flowers and ripe almonds as well."
B'midbar,17,24,"Moshe brought out all the staffs from before ADONAI to all the people of Isra’el, and they looked, and each man took back his staff.
(vi)"
B'midbar,17,25,"ADONAI said to Moshe, “Return Aharon’s staff to its place in front of the testimony. It is to be kept there as a sign to the rebels, so that they will stop grumbling against me and thus not die.”"
B'midbar,17,26,Moshe did this; he did as ADONAI had ordered him.
B'midbar,17,27,"But the people of Isra’el said to Moshe, “Oh no! We’re dead men! Lost! We’re all lost!"
B'midbar,17,28,"Whenever anyone approaches the tabernacle of ADONAI, he dies! Will we all perish?”"
B'midbar,18,1,"ADONAI said to Aharon, “You, your sons and your father’s family line will be responsible for anything that goes wrong in the sanctuary. You and your sons with you will be responsible for anything wrong in your service as cohanim."
B'midbar,18,2,"But you are to bring your kinsmen, the tribe of Levi, along with yourselves, to work together with you and help you — you and your sons with you — when you are there before the tent of meeting."
B'midbar,18,3,"They are to be at your disposal and perform all kinds of tasks related to the tent; only they are not to come near the holy furnishings or the altar, so that neither they nor you will die."
B'midbar,18,4,"They will work together with you in your duties related to the tent of meeting, whatever the service in the tent may be; but an unauthorized person is not to come near you."
B'midbar,18,5,"You will take charge of all the holy things and the altar, so that there will no longer be anger against the people of Isra’el."
B'midbar,18,6,"I myself have taken your kinsmen the L’vi’im from among the people of Isra’el; they have been given as a gift to ADONAI for you, so that you can perform the service in the tent of meeting."
B'midbar,18,7,You and your sons with you will exercise your prerogatives and duties as cohanim in regard to everything having to do with the altar and within the curtain. I entrust the service required of cohanim to you; the unauthorized person who tries to perform it is to be put to death.”
B'midbar,18,8,"ADONAI said to Aharon, “I myself have put you in charge of the contributions given to me. Everything consecrated by the people of Isra’el I have given and set aside for you and your sons; this is a perpetual law."
B'midbar,18,9,"Here is what is to be yours of the especially holy things taken from the fire: every offering they make — that is, every grain offering, sin offering and guilt offering of theirs that they turn over to me — will be especially holy for you and your sons."
B'midbar,18,10,You are to eat it in an especially holy place; every male may eat it; it will be set apart for you.
B'midbar,18,11,"“Also yours is the contribution the people of Isra’el give in the form of wave offerings. I have given these to you, your sons and your daughters with you; this is a perpetual law. Everyone in your family who is clean may eat it."
B'midbar,18,12,"All the best of the olive oil, wine and grain, the first portion of what they give to ADONAI, I have given to you."
B'midbar,18,13,"The first produce to turn ripe of all that is in their land, which they bring to ADONAI, is to be yours; every clean person in your family may eat it."
B'midbar,18,14,“Everything in Isra’el which has been consecrated unconditionally is to be yours.
B'midbar,18,15,"“Everything that comes first out of the womb, of all living things which they offer to ADONAI, whether human or animal, will be yours. However, the firstborn of a human being you must redeem, and the firstborn of an unclean beast you are to redeem."
B'midbar,18,16,"The sum to be paid for redeeming anyone a month old or over is to be five shekels of silver [two ounces], as you value it, using the sanctuary shekel (this is the same as twenty gerahs)."
B'midbar,18,17,"But the firstborn of an ox, sheep or goat you are not to redeem; they are holy — you are to splash their blood against the altar and make their fat go up in smoke as an offering made by fire, as a fragrant aroma for ADONAI."
B'midbar,18,18,"Their meat will be yours, like the breast that is waved and the right thigh — they will be yours."
B'midbar,18,19,"All the contributions of holy things which the people of Isra’el offer to ADONAI I have given to you, your sons and your daughters with you; this is a perpetual law, an eternal covenant of salt before ADONAI for you and your descendants with you.”"
B'midbar,18,20,"ADONAI said to Aharon, “You are not to have any inheritance or portion in their land; I am your portion and inheritance among the people of Isra’el.
(vii)"
B'midbar,18,21,“To the descendants of Levi I have given the entire tenth of the produce collected in Isra’el. It is their inheritance in payment for the service they render in the tent of meeting.
B'midbar,18,22,"From now on, the people of Isra’el are not to approach the tent of meeting, so that they will not bear the consequences of their sin and die."
B'midbar,18,23,"Only the L’vi’im are to perform the service in the tent of meeting, and they will be responsible for whatever they do wrong. This is to be a permanent regulation through all your generations. They are to have no inheritance among the people of Isra’el"
B'midbar,18,24,because I have given to the L’vi’im as their inheritance the tenths of the produce which the people of Isra’el set aside as a gift for ADONAI. This is why I have said to them that they are to have no inheritance among the people of Isra’el.”
B'midbar,18,25,ADONAI said to Moshe
B'midbar,18,26,"“Tell the L’vi’im, ‘When you take from the people of Isra’el the tenth of the produce which I have given you from them as your inheritance, you are to set aside from it a gift for ADONAI, one tenth of the tenth."
B'midbar,18,27,The gift you set aside will be accounted to you as if it were grain from the threshing-floor and grape juice from the wine vat.
B'midbar,18,28,"In this way you will set aside a gift for ADONAI from all your tenths that you receive from the people of Isra’el, and from these tenths you are to give to Aharon the cohen the gift set aside for ADONAI."
B'midbar,18,29,"From everything given to you, you are to set aside all that is due ADONAI, the best part of it, its holy portion.’
(Maftir)"
B'midbar,18,30,"“Therefore you are to tell them, ‘When you set aside from it its best part, it will be accounted to the L’vi’im as if it were grain from the threshing-floor and grape juice from the wine vat."
B'midbar,18,31,"You may eat it anywhere, you and your households; because it is your payment in return for your service in the tent of meeting."
B'midbar,18,32,"Moreover, because you will have set aside from it its best parts, you will not be committing any sin because of it; for you are not to profane the holy things of the people of Isra’el, or you will die.’”

B'midbar,19,1,ADONAI said to Moshe and Aharon
B'midbar,19,2,“This is the regulation from the Torah which ADONAI has commanded. Tell the people of Isra’el to bring you a young red female cow without fault or defect and which has never borne a yoke.
B'midbar,19,3,You are to give it to El‘azar the cohen; it is to be brought outside the camp and slaughtered in front of him.
B'midbar,19,4,El‘azar the cohen is to take some of its blood with his finger and sprinkle this blood toward the front of the tent of meeting seven times.
B'midbar,19,5,"The heifer is to be burned to ashes before his eyes — its skin, meat, blood and dung is to be burned to ashes."
B'midbar,19,6,"The cohen is to take cedar-wood, hyssop and scarlet yarn and throw them onto the heifer as it is burning up."
B'midbar,19,7,"Then the cohen is to wash his clothes and himself in water, after which he may re-enter the camp; but the cohen will remain unclean until evening."
B'midbar,19,8,"The person who burned up the heifer is to wash his clothes and himself in water, but he will remain unclean until evening."
B'midbar,19,9,A man who is clean is to collect the ashes of the heifer and store them outside the camp in a clean place. They are to be kept for the community of the people of Isra’el to prepare water for purification from sin.
B'midbar,19,10,The one who collected the ashes of the heifer is to wash his clothes and be unclean until evening. For the people of Isra’el and for the foreigner staying with them this will be a permanent regulation.
B'midbar,19,11,"“Anyone who touches a corpse, no matter whose dead body it is, will be unclean for seven days."
B'midbar,19,12,"He must purify himself with [these ashes] on the third and seventh days; then he will be clean. But if he does not purify himself the third and seventh days, he will not be clean."
B'midbar,19,13,"Anyone who touches a corpse, no matter whose dead body it is, and does not purify himself has defiled the tabernacle of ADONAI. That person will be cut off from Isra’el, because the water for purification was not sprinkled on him. He will be unclean; his uncleanness is still on him."
B'midbar,19,14,"“This is the law: when a person dies in a tent, everyone who enters the tent and everything in the tent will be unclean for seven days."
B'midbar,19,15,Every open container without a cover closely attached is unclean.
B'midbar,19,16,"Also whoever is in an open field and touches a corpse, whether of someone killed by a weapon or of someone who died naturally, or the bone of a person, or a grave, will be unclean for seven days."
B'midbar,19,17,“For the unclean person they are to take some of the ashes of the animal burned up as a purification from sin and add them to fresh water in a container. (LY: ii)
B'midbar,19,18,"A clean person is to take a bunch of hyssop leaves, dip it in the water and sprinkle it on the tent, on all the containers, on the people who were there, and on the person who touched the bone or the person killed or the one who died naturally or the grave."
B'midbar,19,19,The clean person will sprinkle the unclean person on the third and seventh days. On the seventh day he will purify him; then he will wash his clothes and himself in water; and he will be clean at evening.
B'midbar,19,20,The person who remains unclean and does not purify himself will be cut off from the community because he has defiled the sanctuary of ADONAI. The water for purification has not been sprinkled on him; he is unclean.
B'midbar,19,21,This is to be a permanent regulation for them. The person who sprinkles the water for purification is to wash his clothes. Whoever touches the water for purification will be unclean until evening.
B'midbar,19,22,"Anything the unclean person touches will be unclean, and anyone who touches him will be unclean until evening.”"
B'midbar,20,1,"The people of Isra’el, the whole community, entered the Tzin Desert in the first month, and they stayed in Kadesh. There Miryam died, and there she was buried."
B'midbar,20,2,"Because the community had no water, they assembled themselves against Moshe and Aharon."
B'midbar,20,3,"The people quarreled with Moshe and said, “We wish we had died when our brothers died before ADONAI."
B'midbar,20,4,"Why did you bring ADONAI’s community into this desert? To die there, we and our livestock?"
B'midbar,20,5,"Why did you make us leave Egypt? To bring us to this terrible place without seed, figs, grapevines, pomegranates or even water to drink?”"
B'midbar,20,6,"Moshe and Aharon left the assembly, went to the entrance of the tent of meeting and fell on their faces; and the glory of ADONAI appeared to them.

B'midbar,20,7,ADONAI said to Moshe
B'midbar,20,8,"“Take the staff, assemble the community, you and Aharon your brother; and before their eyes, tell the rock to produce its water. You will bring them water out of the rock and thus enable the community and their livestock to drink.”"
B'midbar,20,9,"Moshe took the staff from the presence of ADONAI, as he had ordered him."
B'midbar,20,10,"But after Moshe and Aharon had assembled the community in front of the rock, he said to them, “Listen here, you rebels! Are we supposed to bring you water from this rock?”"
B'midbar,20,11,"Then Moshe raised his hand and hit the rock twice with his staff. Water flowed out in abundance, and the community and their livestock drank."
B'midbar,20,12,"But ADONAI said to Moshe and Aharon, “Because you did not trust in me, so as to cause me to be regarded as holy by the people of Isra’el, you will not bring this community into the land I have given them.”"
B'midbar,20,13,"This is M’rivah Spring [Disputation Spring], where the people of Isra’el disputed with ADONAI, and he was caused to be regarded as holy by them.
(LY: iv)"
B'midbar,20,14,Moshe sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom: “This is what your brother Isra’el says: you know all the troubles we have gone through 
B'midbar,20,15,"that our ancestors went down into Egypt, we lived in Egypt a long time, and the Egyptians treated us and our ancestors badly."
B'midbar,20,16,"But when we cried out to ADONAI, he heard us, sent an angel and brought us out of Egypt. Now here we are in Kadesh, a city at the edge of your territory."
B'midbar,20,17,"Please let us pass through your land. We will not go through fields or vineyards, and we won’t drink any water from the wells. We will go along the King’s Highway, not turning aside either to the right or to the left until we have left your territory.”"
B'midbar,20,18,"But Edom answered, “You are not to pass through my land; if you do, I will come out against you with the sword.”"
B'midbar,20,19,"The people of Isra’el replied, “We will keep to the highway; if we do drink the water, either we or our livestock, we will pay for it. Just let us pass through on foot — it’s nothing.”"
B'midbar,20,20,"But he said, “You are not to pass through”; and Edom came out against them with many people and much force."
B'midbar,20,21,"Thus Edom refused to allow Isra’el passage through its territory, so Isra’el turned away.
(RY: iii, LY: v)"
B'midbar,20,22,"They traveled on from Kadesh; and the people of Isra’el, the whole community, arrived at Mount Hor."
B'midbar,20,23,"At Mount Hor, by the border of the land of Edom, ADONAI said to Moshe and Aharon"
B'midbar,20,24,"“Aharon is about to be gathered to his people, because he is not to enter the land I have given to the people of Isra’el, inasmuch as you rebelled against what I said at the M’rivah Spring."
B'midbar,20,25,"Take Aharon and El‘azar his son, bring them up to Mount Hor"
B'midbar,20,26,remove the garments from Aharon and put them on El‘azar his son. Aharon will be gathered to his people — he will die there.”
B'midbar,20,27,Moshe did as ADONAI had ordered. They went up onto Mount Hor before the eyes of the whole community.
B'midbar,20,28,"Moshe removed the garments from Aharon, and put them on El‘azar his son, and Aharon died there on the top of the mountain. Then Moshe and El‘azar came down the mountain."
B'midbar,20,29,"When the entire community saw that Aharon was dead, they mourned Aharon thirty days, the whole house of Isra’el."
B'midbar,21,1,"Then the king of ‘Arad, a Kena‘ani who lived in the Negev, heard that Isra’el was approaching by way of Atarim, so he attacked Isra’el and took some of them captive."
B'midbar,21,2,"Isra’el made a vow to ADONAI, “If you will hand this people over to me, I will completely destroy their cities.”"
B'midbar,21,3,"ADONAI listened to what Isra’el said and handed over the Kena‘anim, so they completely destroyed them and their cities and named the place Hormah [complete destruction]."
B'midbar,21,4,Then they traveled from Mount Hor on the road toward the Sea of Suf in order to go around the land of Edom; but the people’s tempers grew short because of the detour.
B'midbar,21,5,"The people spoke against God and against Moshe: “Why did you bring us up out of Egypt? To die in the desert? There’s no real food, there’s no water, and we’re sick of this miserable stuff we’re eating!”
(LY: vi)"
B'midbar,21,6,"In response, ADONAI sent poisonous snakes among the people; they bit the people, and many of Isra’el’s people died."
B'midbar,21,7,"The people came to Moshe and said, “We sinned by speaking against ADONAI and against you. Pray to ADONAI that he rid us of these snakes.” Moshe prayed for the people"
B'midbar,21,8,"and ADONAI answered Moshe: “Make a poisonous snake and put it on a pole. When anyone who has been bitten sees it, he will live.”"
B'midbar,21,9,"Moshe made a bronze snake and put it on the pole; if a snake had bitten someone, then, when he looked toward the bronze snake, he stayed alive."
B'midbar,21,10,The people of Isra’el traveled on and camped at Ovot.
B'midbar,21,11,"From Ovot they traveled and camped at ‘Iyei-Ha‘avarim, in the desert fronting Mo’av on the east."
B'midbar,21,12,From there they traveled and camped in Vadi Zered.
B'midbar,21,13,"From there they traveled and camped on the other side of the Arnon, in the desert; this river comes out of the territory of the Emori; for the Arnon is the boundary between Mo’av and the Emori."
B'midbar,21,14,"This is why it says, in the Book of the Wars of ADONAI, “. . . Vahev at Sufah, the vadis of Arnon"
B'midbar,21,15,"and the slope of the vadis extending as far as the site of ‘Ar, which lie next to the territory of Mo’av.”"
B'midbar,21,16,"From there they went on to Be’er [well]; that is the well about which ADONAI said to Moshe, “Assemble the people, and I will give them water.”"
B'midbar,21,17,"Then Isra’el sang this song:
“Spring up, oh well!
Sing to the well"
B'midbar,21,18,"sunk by the princes,
dug by the people’s leaders
with the scepter,
with their staffs!”
From the desert they went to Mattanah"
B'midbar,21,19,"from Mattanah to Nachali’el, from Nachali’el to Bamot"
B'midbar,21,20,"and from Bamot to the valley by the plain of Mo’av at the start of the Pisgah range, where it overlooks the desert.
(RY: iv, LY: vii)"
B'midbar,21,21,"Isra’el sent messengers to Sichon, king of the Emori, with this message"
B'midbar,21,22,"“Let me pass through your land. We won’t turn aside into fields or vineyards, and we won’t drink any water from the wells. We will go along the King’s Highway until we have left your territory.”"
B'midbar,21,23,"But Sichon would not allow Isra’el to pass through his territory. Instead, Sichon mustered all his people and went out into the desert to fight Isra’el. On reaching Yachatz, he fought Isra’el."
B'midbar,21,24,"Isra’el defeated him by force of arms and took control of his land from the Arnon to the Yabok River, but only as far as the people of ‘Amon, because the territory of the people of ‘Amon was well defended."
B'midbar,21,25,"Isra’el took all these cities — Isra’el lived in all the cities of the Emori, in Heshbon and all its surrounding towns."
B'midbar,21,26,"Heshbon was the city of Sichon, the king of the Emori, who had fought against the former king of Mo’av and conquered all his land up to the Arnon."
B'midbar,21,27,"This is why the storytellers say,
“Come to Heshbon! Let it be rebuilt!
Let Sichon’s city be restored!"
B'midbar,21,28,"“For fire burst out of Heshbon,
a flame from the city of Sichon.
It consumed ‘Ar of Mo’av,
the lords of Arnon’s high places."
B'midbar,21,29,"“Woe to you, Mo’av!
You are destroyed, people of K’mosh!
He let his sons be fugitives and his daughters captives
of Sichon, king of the Emori."
B'midbar,21,30,"“We shot them down; Heshbon is destroyed,
all the way to Divon.
We even laid waste to Nofach,
which extends as far as Meidva.”"
B'midbar,21,31,Thus Isra’el lived in the land of the Emori.
B'midbar,21,32,Moshe sent men to reconnoiter Ya‘zer; they captured its towns and drove out the Emori who were there.
B'midbar,21,33,"Then they turned and went up along the road to Bashan; and ‘Og, the king of Bashan, marched out against them, he with all his people, to fight at Edre‘i. (LY: Maftir)"
B'midbar,21,34,"ADONAI said to Moshe, “Don’t be afraid of him, for I have handed him over to you with all his people and his land. You will treat him just as you did Sichon, king of the Emori, who lived at Heshbon.”"
B'midbar,21,35,"So they struck him down, with his sons and all his people, until there was no one left alive; and then they took control of his land."
B'midbar,22,1,"Then the people of Isra’el traveled on and camped in the plains of Mo’av beyond the Yarden River, opposite Yericho.
Haftarah Hukkat: Shof’tim (Judges) 11:1–33
B’rit Hadashah suggested readings for Parashah Hukkat: Yochanan (John) 3:9–21; 4:3–30; 12:27–50
[In regular years read with Parashah 39, in leap years read separately]"
B'midbar,22,2,Now Balak the son of Tzippor saw all that Isra’el had done to the Emori.
B'midbar,22,3,"Mo’av was very afraid of the people, because there were so many of them; Mo’av was overcome with dread because of the people of Isra’el."
B'midbar,22,4,"So Mo’av said to the leaders of Midyan, “This horde will lick up everything around us, the way an ox licks up grass in the field.”
Balak the son of Tzippor was king of Mo’av at that time."
B'midbar,22,5,"He sent messengers to Bil‘am the son of B‘or, at P’tor by the [Euphrates] River in his native land, to tell him, “Listen, a people has come out of Egypt, spread over all the land and settled down next to me."
B'midbar,22,6,"Therefore, please come, and curse this people for me, because they are stronger than I am. Maybe I will be able to strike them down and drive them out of the land, for I know that whomever you bless is in fact blessed, and whomever you curse is in fact cursed.”"
B'midbar,22,7,"The leaders of Mo’av and Midyan left, taking with them the payment for divining, came to Bil‘am and spoke to him the words of Balak."
B'midbar,22,8,"He said to them, “Stay here tonight, and I will bring you back whatever answer ADONAI tells me.” So the princes of Mo’av stayed with Bil‘am."
B'midbar,22,9,"God came to Bil‘am and said, “Who are these men with you?”"
B'midbar,22,10,"Bil‘am said to God, “Balak the son of Tzippor, king of Mo’av, has sent me this message"
B'midbar,22,11,"‘The people who came out of Egypt have spread over the land; now, come and curse them for me; maybe I will be able to fight against them and drive them out.’”"
B'midbar,22,12,"God answered Bil‘am, “You are not to go with them; you are not to curse the people, because they are blessed.”
(RY: v; LY: ii)"
B'midbar,22,13,"Bil‘am got up in the morning and said to the princes of Balak, “Return to your own land, because ADONAI refuses to give me permission to go with you.”"
B'midbar,22,14,"The princes of Mo’av got up, returned to Balak and said, “Bil‘am refuses to come with us.”"
B'midbar,22,15,"Balak again sent princes, more of them and of higher status than the first group."
B'midbar,22,16,"They went to Bil‘am and said to him, “Here is what Balak the son of Tzippor says: ‘Please don’t let anything keep you from coming to me."
B'midbar,22,17,"I will reward you very well, and whatever you say to me I will do. So please come, and curse this people for me.’”"
B'midbar,22,18,"Bil‘am answered the servants of Balak, “Even if Balak were to give me his palace filled with silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of ADONAI my God to do anything, great or small."
B'midbar,22,19,"Now, please, you too, stay here tonight; so that I may find out what else ADONAI will say to me.”"
B'midbar,22,20,"God came to Bil‘am during the night and said to him, “If the men have come to summon you, get up and go with them; but do only what I tell you.”
(LY: iii)"
B'midbar,22,21,"So Bil‘am got up in the morning, saddled his donkey and went with the princes of Mo’av."
B'midbar,22,22,"But God’s anger flared up because he went, and the angel of ADONAI stationed himself on the path to bar his way. He was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him."
B'midbar,22,23,"The donkey saw the angel of ADONAI standing on the road, drawn sword in hand; so the donkey turned off the road into the field; and Bil‘am had to beat the donkey to get it back on the road."
B'midbar,22,24,Then the angel of ADONAI stood on the road where it became narrow as it passed among the vineyards and had stone walls on both sides.
B'midbar,22,25,"The donkey saw the angel of ADONAI and pushed up against the wall, crushing Bil‘am’s foot against the wall. So he beat it again."
B'midbar,22,26,The angel of ADONAI moved ahead and stood in a place so tight that there was no room to turn either right or left.
B'midbar,22,27,"Again the donkey saw the angel of ADONAI and lay down under Bil‘am, which made him so angry that he hit the donkey with his stick."
B'midbar,22,28,"But ADONAI enabled the donkey to speak, and it said to Bil‘am, “What have I done to you to make you beat me these three times?”"
B'midbar,22,29,"Bil‘am said to the donkey, “It’s because you’ve been making a fool of me! I wish I had a sword in my hand; I would kill you on the spot!”"
B'midbar,22,30,"The donkey said to Bil‘am, “I’m your donkey, right? You’ve ridden me all your life, right? Have I ever treated you like this before?” “No,” he admitted."
B'midbar,22,31,"Then ADONAI opened Bil‘am’s eyes, so that he could see the angel of ADONAI standing in the way with his drawn sword in his hand, and he bowed his head and fell on his face."
B'midbar,22,32,"The angel of ADONAI said to him, “Why did you hit your donkey three times like that? I have come out here to bar your way, because you are rushing to oppose me."
B'midbar,22,33,"The donkey saw me and turned aside these three times; and indeed, if she hadn’t turned away from me, I would have killed you by now and saved it alive!”"
B'midbar,22,34,"Bil‘am said to the angel of ADONAI, “I have sinned. I didn’t know that you were standing on the road to block me. Now, therefore, if what I am doing displeases you, I will go back.”"
B'midbar,22,35,"But the angel of ADONAI said to Bil‘am, “No, go on with the men; but you are to say only what I tell you to say.” So Bil‘am went along with the princes of Balak."
B'midbar,22,36,"When Balak heard that Bil‘am had come, he went out to meet him in the city of Mo’av at the Arnon border, in the farthest reaches of the territory."
B'midbar,22,37,"Balak said to Bil‘am, “I sent more than once to summon you! Why didn’t you come to me? Did you think I couldn’t pay you enough?”"
B'midbar,22,38,"Bil‘am replied to Balak, “Here, I’ve come to you! But I have no power of my own to say anything. The word that God puts in my mouth is what I will say.”
(RY: vi, LY: iv)"
B'midbar,22,39,Bil‘am went with Balak. When they arrived at Kiryat-Hutzot
B'midbar,22,40,"Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, then sent to Bil‘am and the princes with him."
B'midbar,22,41,In the morning Balak took Bil‘am and brought him up to the high places of Ba‘al; from there he could see a portion of the people.
B'midbar,23,1,"Bil‘am said to Balak, “Build me seven altars here, and prepare me seven bulls and seven rams here.”"
B'midbar,23,2,Balak did as Bil‘am said; then Balak and Bil‘am offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
B'midbar,23,3,"Bil‘am said to Balak, “Stand by your burnt offering while I go off; maybe ADONAI will come and meet me; and whatever he shows me I will tell you.” He went off to a bare hill."
B'midbar,23,4,"God met Bil‘am, who said to him, “I prepared the seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.”"
B'midbar,23,5,"Then ADONAI put a word in Bil‘am’s mouth and said, “Go on back to Balak, and speak as I tell you.”"
B'midbar,23,6,"He went back to him, and there, standing by his burnt offering, he with all the princes of Mo’av"
B'midbar,23,7,"he made his pronouncement:
“Balak, the king of Mo’av,
brings me from Aram, from the eastern hills, saying,
‘Come, curse Ya‘akov for me;
come and denounce Isra’el.’"
B'midbar,23,8,"“How am I to curse
those whom God has not cursed?
How am I to denounce
those whom ADONAI has not denounced?"
B'midbar,23,9,"“From the top of the rocks I see them,
from the hills I behold them —
yes, a people that will dwell alone
and not think itself one of the nations."
B'midbar,23,10,"“Who has counted the dust of Ya‘akov
or numbered the ashes of Isra’el?
May I die as the righteous die!
May my end be like theirs!”"
B'midbar,23,11,"Balak said to Bil‘am, “What have you done to me?! To curse my enemies is why I brought you; and, here, you have totally blessed them!”"
B'midbar,23,12,"He answered, “Mustn’t I take care to say just what ADONAI puts in my mouth?”
(LY: v)"
B'midbar,23,13,"Balak said to him, “All right, come with me to another place where you can see them. You will see only some of them, not all; but you can curse them for me from there.”"
B'midbar,23,14,"He took him through the field of Tzofim to the top of the Pisgah Range, built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar."
B'midbar,23,15,"Bil‘am said to Balak, “Stand here by your burnt offering, while I go over there for a meeting.”"
B'midbar,23,16,"ADONAI met Bil‘am, put a word in his mouth and said, “Go on back to Balak, and speak as I tell you.”"
B'midbar,23,17,"He came to him and stood by his burnt offering, with all the princes of Mo’av. Balak asked him, “What did ADONAI say?”"
B'midbar,23,18,"Then Bil‘am made his pronouncement:
“Get up, Balak, and listen!
Turn your ears to me, son of Tzippor!"
B'midbar,23,19,"“God is not a human who lies
or a mortal who changes his mind.
When he says something, he will do it;
when he makes a promise, he will fulfill it."
B'midbar,23,20,"Look, I am ordered to bless;
when he blesses, I can’t reverse it."
B'midbar,23,21,"“No one has seen guilt in Ya‘akov,
or perceived perversity in Isra’el;
ADONAI their God is with them
and acclaimed as king among them."
B'midbar,23,22,"“God, who brought them out of Egypt,
gives them the strength of a wild ox"
B'midbar,23,23,"thus one can’t put a spell on Ya‘akov,
no magic will work against Isra’el.
It can now be said of Ya‘akov and Isra’el,
‘What is this that God has done?!’"
B'midbar,23,24,"“Here is a people rising up like a lioness;
like a lion he rears himself up —
he will not lie down till he eats up the prey
and drinks the blood of the slain.”"
B'midbar,23,25,"Balak said to Bil‘am, “Obviously, you won’t curse them. But at least don’t bless them!”"
B'midbar,23,26,"However, Bil‘am answered Balak, “Didn’t I warn you that I must do everything ADONAI says?”
(RY: vii, LY: vi)"
B'midbar,23,27,"Balak said to Bil‘am, “Come, I will take you now to another place; maybe it will please God for you to curse them for me from there.”"
B'midbar,23,28,"Balak took Bil‘am to the top of P‘or, overlooking the desert."
B'midbar,23,29,"Bil‘am said to Balak, “Build me seven altars here, and prepare me seven bulls and seven rams.”"
B'midbar,23,30,Balak did as Bil‘am said and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
B'midbar,24,1,"When Bil‘am saw that it pleased ADONAI to bless Isra’el, he didn’t go, as at the other times, to make use of divination, but looked out toward the desert."
B'midbar,24,2,Bil‘am raised his eyes and saw Isra’el encamped tribe by tribe. Then the Spirit of God came upon him
B'midbar,24,3,"and he made his pronouncement:
“This is the speech of Bil‘am, son of B‘or;
the speech of the man whose eyes have been opened"
B'midbar,24,4,"the speech of him who hears God’s words;
who sees what Shaddai sees,
who has fallen, yet has open eyes"
B'midbar,24,5,"“How lovely are your tents, Ya‘akov;
your encampments, Isra’el!"
B'midbar,24,6,"They spread out like valleys,
like gardens by the riverside,
like succulent aloes planted by ADONAI,
like cedar trees next to the water."
B'midbar,24,7,"“Water will flow from their branches,
their seed will have water aplenty.
Their king will be higher than Agag
and his kingdom lifted high."
B'midbar,24,8,"God, who brought them out of Egypt,
gives them the strength of a wild ox.
They will devour the nations opposing them,
break their bones, pierce them with their arrows."
B'midbar,24,9,"“When they lie down they crouch like a lion,
or like a lioness — who dares to rouse it?
Blessed be all who bless you!
Cursed be all who curse you!”"
B'midbar,24,10,"Balak blazed with fury against Bil‘am. He struck his hands together and said to Bil‘am, “I summoned you to curse my enemies. But here, you have done nothing but bless them — three times already!"
B'midbar,24,11,"Now you had better escape to your own place! I had planned to reward you very well, but now ADONAI has deprived you of payment.”"
B'midbar,24,12,"Bil‘am answered Balak, “Didn’t I tell the messengers you sent me"
B'midbar,24,13,"that even if Balak would give me his palace full of silver and gold, I could not of my own accord go beyond the word of ADONAI to do either good or bad? that what ADONAI said is what I would say? (LY: vii)"
B'midbar,24,14,"But now that I am going back to my own people, come, I will warn you what this people will do to your people in the acharit-hayamim."
B'midbar,24,15,"So he made his pronouncement:
“This is the speech of Bil‘am, son of B‘or;
the speech of the man whose eyes have been opened"
B'midbar,24,16,"the speech of him who hears God’s words;
who knows what ‘Elyon knows,
who sees what Shaddai sees,
who has fallen, yet has open eyes"
B'midbar,24,17,"“I see him, but not now;
I behold him, but not soon —
a star will step forth from Ya‘akov,
a scepter will arise from Isra’el,
to crush the corners of Mo’av
and destroy all descendants of Shet."
B'midbar,24,18,"His enemies will be his possessions —
Edom and Se‘ir, possessions.
Isra’el will do valiantly"
B'midbar,24,19,"From Ya‘akov will come someone who will rule,
and he will destroy what is left of the city.”"
B'midbar,24,20,"He saw ‘Amalek and made this pronouncement:
“First among nations was ‘Amalek,
but destruction will be its end.”"
B'midbar,24,21,"He saw the Keini and made this pronouncement:
“Though your dwelling is firm,
your nest set on rock"
B'midbar,24,22,"Kayin will be wasted
while captive to Ashur.”"
B'midbar,24,23,"Finally, he made this pronouncement:
“Oh no! Who can live when God does this?"
B'midbar,24,24,"But ships will come from the coast of Kittim
to subdue Ashur and subdue ‘Ever,
but they too will come to destruction.”"
B'midbar,24,25,"Then Bil‘am got up, left and returned to his home; and Balak too went his way."
B'midbar,25,1,"Isra’el stayed at Sheetim, and there the people began whoring with the women of Mo’av."
B'midbar,25,2,"These women invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods, where the people ate and bowed down to their gods."
B'midbar,25,3,"With Isra’el thus joined to Ba‘al-P‘or, the anger of ADONAI blazed up against Isra’el."
B'midbar,25,4,"ADONAI said to Moshe, “Take all the chiefs of the people, and hang them facing the sun before ADONAI, so that the raging fury of ADONAI will turn away from Isra’el.”"
B'midbar,25,5,"Moshe said to the judges of Isra’el, “Each of you is to put to death those in his tribe who have joined themselves to Ba‘al-P‘or.”"
B'midbar,25,6,"Just then, in the sight of Moshe and the whole community of Isra’el, as they were weeping at the entrance to the tent of meeting, a man from Isra’el came by, bringing to his family a woman from Midyan. (Maftir)"
B'midbar,25,7,"When Pinchas the son of El‘azar, the son of Aharon the cohen, saw it, he got up from the middle of the crowd, took a spear in his hand"
B'midbar,25,8,"and pursued the man from Isra’el right into the inner part of the tent, where he thrust his spear through both of them — the man from Isra’el and the woman through her stomach. Thus was the plague among the people of Isra’el stopped"
B'midbar,25,9,"nevertheless, 24,000 died in the plague.
Haftarah Balak: Mikhah (Micah) 5:6(7)– 6:8
B’rit Hadashah suggested readings for Parashah Balak: 2 Kefa (2 Peter) 2:1–22; Y’hudah (Jude) 11; Revelation 2:14–15"
B'midbar,25,10,ADONAI said to Moshe
B'midbar,25,11,"“Pinchas the son of El‘azar, the son of Aharon the cohen, has deflected my anger from the people of Isra’el by being as zealous as I am, so that I didn’t destroy them in my own zeal."
B'midbar,25,12,"Therefore say, ‘I am giving him my covenant of shalom"
B'midbar,25,13,making a covenant with him and his descendants after him that the office of cohen will be theirs forever.’ This is because he was zealous on behalf of his God and made atonement for the people of Isra’el.”
B'midbar,25,14,"The name of the man from Isra’el who was killed, put to death with the woman from Midyan, was Zimri the son of Salu, leader of one of the clans from the tribe of Shim‘on."
B'midbar,25,15,"The name of the woman from Midyan who was killed was Kozbi the daughter of Tzur, and he was head of the people in one of the clans of Midyan."
B'midbar,25,16,ADONAI said to Moshe
B'midbar,25,17,“Treat the Midyanim as enemies and attack them
B'midbar,25,18,"because they are treating you as enemies by the trickery they used to deceive you in the P‘or incident and in the affair of their sister Kozbi, the daughter of the leader from Midyan, the woman who was killed on the day of the plague in the P‘or incident.”"
B'midbar,25,19,After the plague
B'midbar,26,1,"ADONAI said to Moshe and El‘azar, the son of Aharon the cohen"
B'midbar,26,2,"“Take a census of the entire assembly of the people of Isra’el twenty years old and over, by their ancestral clans, all who are subject to military service in Isra’el.”"
B'midbar,26,3,"Moshe and El‘azar the cohen spoke with them on the plains of Mo’av by the Yarden across from Yericho, explaining"
B'midbar,26,4,"“Those twenty years old and over who came out of the land of Egypt, as ADONAI ordered Moshe and the people of Isra’el.”
(ii)"
B'midbar,26,5,"[The census results begin with] Re’uven, the firstborn of Isra’el. The descendants of Re’uven were: of Hanokh, the family of the Hanokhi; of Pallu, the family of the Pallu’i"
B'midbar,26,6,"of Hetzron, the family of the Hetzroni; and of Karmi the family of the Karmi."
B'midbar,26,7,"These were the the families of the Re’uveni; of them were counted 43,730."
B'midbar,26,8,The sons of Pallu: Eli’av
B'midbar,26,9,"and the sons of Eli’av: N’mu’el, Datan and Aviram. These are the same Datan and Aviram, men of reputation in the community, who rebelled against Moshe and Aharon in Korach’s group, when they rebelled against ADONAI"
B'midbar,26,10,"and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up together with Korach when that group died, and the fire consumed 250 men, and they became a warning sign."
B'midbar,26,11,"(However, the sons of Korach did not die.)"
B'midbar,26,12,"The descendants of Shim‘on, by their families, were: of N’mu’el, the family of the N’mu’eli; of Yamin, the family of the Yamini; of Yakhin, the family of the Yakhini"
B'midbar,26,13,"of Zerach, the family of the Zarchi; and of Sha’ul, the family of the Sha’uli."
B'midbar,26,14,"These were the families of the Shim‘oni, 22,200."
B'midbar,26,15,"The descendants of Gad, by their families, were: of Tz’fon, the family of the Tz’foni; of Haggi, the family of the Haggi; of Shuni, the family of the Shuni"
B'midbar,26,16,"of Ozni, the family of the Ozni; of ‘Eri, the family of the ‘Eri"
B'midbar,26,17,"of Arod, the family of the Arodi; and of Ar’eli, the family of the Ar’eli."
B'midbar,26,18,"These were the families of the sons of Gad, according to those counted of them, 40,500."
B'midbar,26,19,"The sons of Y’hudah: First ‘Er and Onan, but ‘Er and Onan died in the land of Kena‘an."
B'midbar,26,20,"The sons of Y’hudah who had descendants were: of Shelah, the family of the Shelani; of Peretz, the family of the Partzi; and of Zerach, the family of the Zarchi."
B'midbar,26,21,"The sons of Peretz were: of Hetzron, the family of the Hetzroni; and of Hamul, the family of the Hamuli."

B'midbar,26,52,ADONAI said to Moshe
B'midbar,26,53,"“The land is to be parceled out among these as a possession to be inherited, according to the number of names."
B'midbar,26,54,"To those families with more persons you are to give a greater inheritance, and to those with fewer you are to give a smaller inheritance — each family’s inheritance is to be given according to the number counted in it."
B'midbar,26,55,"However, the land is to be awarded by lot. They will inherit according to the names of the tribes of their ancestors"
B'midbar,26,56,but the inheritance is to be parceled out by lot between the families with more and those with fewer.”
B'midbar,26,57,"Those counted among the Levi, by their families, were: of Gershon, the family of the Gershuni, of K’hat, the family of the K’hati; and of M’rari, the family of the M’rari."
B'midbar,26,58,"These are the families of Levi: the family of the Livni, the family of the Hevroni, the family of the Machli, the family of the Mushi and the family of the Korchi. K’hat was the father of ‘Amram."
B'midbar,26,59,"The name of ‘Amram’s wife was Yokheved the daughter of Levi, who was born to Levi in Egypt; and she bore to ‘Amram Aharon, Moshe and their sister Miryam."
B'midbar,26,60,"To Aharon were born Nadav, Avihu, El‘azar and Itamar"
B'midbar,26,61,but Nadav and Avihu died when they offered unauthorized fire before ADONAI.
B'midbar,26,62,"Those males one month old or more counted of the Levi were 23,000. These were not included in the census of the people of Isra’el, because no land for inheritance was given to them among the people of Isra’el."
B'midbar,26,63,"These are the ones counted by Moshe and El‘azar the cohen, who took a census of the people of Isra’el in the plains of Mo’av by the Yarden across from Yericho."
B'midbar,26,64,But there was not a man among them who had also been included in the census of Moshe and Aharon the cohen when they enumerated the people of Isra’el in the Sinai Desert
B'midbar,26,65,"because ADONAI had said of them, “They will surely die in the desert.” So there was not left even one of them, except Kalev the son of Y’funeh and Y’hoshua the son of Nun."
B'midbar,27,1,"Then the daughters of Tz’lof’chad the son of Hefer, the son of Gil‘ad, the son of Machir, the son of M’nasheh, of the families of M’nasheh, the son of Yosef, approached. These were the names of his daughters: Machlah, No‘ah, Hoglah, Milkah and Tirtzah."
B'midbar,27,2,"They stood in front of Moshe, El‘azar the cohen, the leaders and the whole community at the entrance to the tent of meeting and said"
B'midbar,27,3,"“Our father died in the desert. He wasn’t part of the group who assembled themselves to rebel against ADONAI in Korach’s group, but he died in his own sin, and he had no sons."
B'midbar,27,4,Why should the name of our father be eliminated from his family just because he didn’t have a son? Give us property to possess along with the brothers of our father.”
B'midbar,27,5,"Moshe brought their cause before ADONAI.
(iv)"
B'midbar,27,6,ADONAI answered Moshe
B'midbar,27,7,“The daughters of Tz’lof’chad are right in what they say. You must give them property to be inherited along with that of their father’s brothers; have what their father would have inherited pass to them.
B'midbar,27,8,"Moreover, say to the people of Isra’el, ‘If a man dies and does not have a son, you are to have his inheritance pass to his daughter."
B'midbar,27,9,"If he doesn’t have a daughter, give his inheritance to his brothers."
B'midbar,27,10,"If he has no brothers, give his inheritance to his father’s brothers."
B'midbar,27,11,"If his father doesn’t have brothers, give his inheritance to the closest relative in his family, and he will possess it. This will be the standard for judgment to be used by the people of Isra’el, as ADONAI ordered Moshe.’”"
B'midbar,27,12,"ADONAI said to Moshe, “Climb this mountain in the ‘Avarim Range, and look out at the land which I have given the people of Isra’el."
B'midbar,27,13,"After you have seen it, you too will be gathered to your people, just as Aharon your brother was gathered"
B'midbar,27,14,"because in the Tzin Desert, when the community was disputing with me, you rebelled against my order to uphold my holiness by means of the water, with them looking on.” (This was M’rivat-Kadesh Spring, in the Tzin Desert.)"
B'midbar,27,15,Moshe said to ADONAI
B'midbar,27,16,"“Let ADONAI, God of the spirits of all human beings, appoint a man to be over the community"
B'midbar,27,17,"to go out and come in ahead of them, to lead them out and bring them in, so that ADONAI’s community will not be like sheep without a shepherd.”"
B'midbar,27,18,"ADONAI said to Moshe, “Take Y’hoshua the son of Nun, a spiritual man, and lay your hand on him."
B'midbar,27,19,"Put him in front of El‘azar the cohen and the whole community, and commission him in their sight."
B'midbar,27,20,"Delegate to him some of your authority, so that the entire community of Isra’el will obey him."
B'midbar,27,21,"He is to present himself to El‘azar the cohen, who is to find out by means of the urim what ADONAI’s will is for Y’hoshua’s decisions. Then, at his word they will go out, and at his word they will come in, both he and all the people of Isra’el with him, the whole community.”"
B'midbar,27,22,"Moshe did as ADONAI had ordered him. He took Y’hoshua, put him before El‘azar the cohen and the whole community"
B'midbar,27,23,"laid his hands on him, and commissioned him, as ADONAI had said through Moshe."
B'midbar,28,1,(v) ADONAI said to Moshe
B'midbar,28,2,"“Give an order to the people of Isra’el. Tell them, ‘You are to take care to offer me at the proper time the food presented to me as offerings made by fire, providing a fragrant aroma for me.’"
B'midbar,28,3,"Tell them, ‘This is the offering made by fire that you are to bring to ADONAI: male lambs in their first year and without defect, two daily as a regular burnt offering."
B'midbar,28,4,Offer the one lamb in the morning and the other lamb at dusk
B'midbar,28,5,"along with two quarts of fine flour as a grain offering, mixed with one quart of oil from pressed olives."
B'midbar,28,6,"It is the regular burnt offering, the same as was offered on Mount Sinai to give a fragrant aroma, an offering made by fire for ADONAI."
B'midbar,28,7,Its drink offering is to be one-quarter hin for one lamb; in the Holy Place you are to pour out a drink offering of intoxicating liquor to ADONAI.

B'midbar,28,9,"“‘On Shabbat offer two male lambs in their first year and without defect, with one gallon of fine flour as a grain offering, mixed with olive oil, and its drink offering."

Haftarah Pinchas: M’lakhim Alef (1 Kings) 18:46–19:21
B’rit Hadashah suggested readings for Parashah Pinchas: Mattityahu (Matthew) 26:1–30; Mark 14:1–26; Luke 22:1–20; Yochanan (John) 2:13–22; 7:1–13, 37–39; 11:55–12:1; 13:1; 18:28, 39; 19:14; Acts 2:1–21; 12:3–4; 20:5–6, 16; 27:9–11; 1 Corinthians 5:6 – 8; 16:8; Messianic Jews (Hebrews) 11:28
[In regular years read with Parashah 43, in leap years read separately]"
B'midbar,30,2,"Then Moshe spoke to the heads of the tribes of the people of Isra’el. He said, “Here is what ADONAI has ordered"
B'midbar,30,3,"when a man makes a vow to ADONAI or formally obligates himself by swearing an oath, he is not to break his word but is to do everything he said he would do."
B'midbar,30,4,"“When a woman makes a vow to ADONAI, formally obligating herself, while she is a minor living in her father’s house"
B'midbar,30,5,"then, if her father has heard what she vowed or obligated herself to do and holds his peace, then all her vows remain binding — every obligation she has bound herself to will stand."
B'midbar,30,6,"But if on the day her father hears it, he expresses his disapproval, then none of her vows or obligations she has bound herself to will stand; and ADONAI will forgive her, because her father expressed his disapproval."
B'midbar,30,7,"“If, having made vows or rashly committed herself to an obligation, she gets married"
B'midbar,30,8,"and her husband hears but holds his peace with her on the day he learns of it, then her vows and obligations she has bound herself to will stand."
B'midbar,30,9,"But if her husband expresses his disapproval on the day he hears it, he will void the vow which is on her and the obligation to which she has bound herself; and ADONAI will forgive her."
B'midbar,30,10,"“The vow of a widow, however, or of a divorcee, including everything to which she has obligated herself, will stand against her."
B'midbar,30,11,“If a woman vowed in her husband’s house or obligated herself with an oath
B'midbar,30,12,"and her husband heard it but held his peace with her and did not express disapproval, then all her vows and obligations will stand."
B'midbar,30,13,"But if her husband makes them null and void on the day he hears them, then whatever she said, vows or binding obligation, will not stand; her husband has voided them; and ADONAI will forgive her."
B'midbar,30,14,"Her husband may let every vow and every binding obligation stand, or he may void it."
B'midbar,30,15,"But if her husband entirely holds his peace with her day after day, then he confirms all her vows and obligations; he must let them stand, because he held his peace with her on the day he heard them."
B'midbar,30,16,"If he makes them null and void after he has heard them, then he will bear the consequent guilt.”"
B'midbar,30,17,"These are the laws which ADONAI ordered Moshe between a man and his wife, and between a father and his daughter, if she is a minor living in her father’s house."
B'midbar,31,1,(LY: ii) ADONAI said to Moshe
B'midbar,31,2,"“On behalf of the people of Isra’el, take vengeance on the Midyanim. After that, you will be gathered to your people.”"
B'midbar,31,3,"Moshe said to the people, “Equip men from among yourselves for war. They are to go and fight Midyan, in order to carry out ADONAI’s vengeance on Midyan."
B'midbar,31,4,You are to send to the war a thousand men from every one of Isra’el’s tribes.”
B'midbar,31,5,"So out of the thousands of people in Isra’el, a thousand armed men from each tribe, 12,000 altogether, were mustered for war."
B'midbar,31,6,"Moshe sent them, a thousand from each tribe, to the war; he sent them and Pinchas the son of El‘azar the cohen to the war, with the holy utensils and the trumpets for sounding the alarm in his care."
B'midbar,31,7,"They fought against Midyan, as ADONAI had ordered Moshe, and killed every male."
B'midbar,31,8,"They killed the kings of Midyan along with the others who were slain — Evi, Rekem, Tzur, Hur and Reva, the five kings of Midyan. They also killed Bil‘am the son of B‘or with the sword."
B'midbar,31,9,"The people of Isra’el took captive the women of Midyan and their little ones, and they took as booty all their cattle, flocks and other goods."
B'midbar,31,10,They set fire to all their cities in the areas where they lived and all their camps.
B'midbar,31,11,"They took all the booty, all the people and animals they had captured"
B'midbar,31,12,"and brought the captives, booty and spoil to Moshe, El‘azar the cohen and the community of Isra’el in the camp on the plains of Mo’av by the Yarden across from Yericho.
(RY: ii, LY: iii)"
B'midbar,31,13,"Moshe, El‘azar the cohen and all the community leaders went to meet them outside the camp."
B'midbar,31,14,"But Moshe was angry with the army officers, the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds coming in from the battlefield."
B'midbar,31,15,"Moshe asked them, “You let the women live?"
B'midbar,31,16,"Why, these are the ones who — because of Bil‘am’s advice — caused the people of Isra’el to rebel, breaking faith with ADONAI in the P‘or incident, so that the plague broke out among ADONAI’s community!"
B'midbar,31,17,"Now kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has ever slept with a man."
B'midbar,31,18,"But the young girls who have never slept with a man, keep alive for yourselves."
B'midbar,31,19,"Pitch your tents outside the camp for seven days. Whoever has killed a person or touched the corpse of someone slain, purify yourselves on the third and seventh days, you and your captives."
B'midbar,31,20,"Also purify every garment, whether of skin or goat’s hair, and everything made of wood.”"
B'midbar,31,21,"El‘azar the cohen said to the soldiers who had gone to the front, “This is the regulation from the Torah which ADONAI has ordered Moshe."
B'midbar,31,22,"Even though gold, silver, brass, iron, tin and lead"
B'midbar,31,23,"can all withstand fire, so that you are indeed to purify everything made of these materials by having them pass through fire; nevertheless they must also be purified with the water for purification. Everything that can’t withstand fire you are to have go through the water."
B'midbar,31,24,"On the seventh day you are to wash your clothes, and you will be clean; after that you may enter the camp.”
(LY: iv)"
B'midbar,31,25,ADONAI said to Moshe
B'midbar,31,26,"“Take all the booty, both people and animals, you, El‘azar the cohen and the leaders of clans in the community"
B'midbar,31,27,"and divide the booty into two parts: half for the experienced soldiers who went out to battle, and half for the rest of the community."
B'midbar,31,28,"From the portion of the soldiers who went out to battle, levy a tax for ADONAI consisting of one-five-hundredth of the persons, cattle, donkeys and sheep"
B'midbar,31,29,take it from their half and give it to El‘azar the cohen as a portion set apart for ADONAI.
B'midbar,31,30,"From the half that goes to the people of Isra’el, you are to take one-fiftieth of the persons, and of the cattle, donkeys and sheep, that is, of all the livestock; and give them to the L’vi’im taking care of the tabernacle of ADONAI.”"
B'midbar,31,31,Moshe and El‘azar the cohen did as ADONAI had ordered Moshe.
B'midbar,31,32,"The booty, over and above the portion which the soldiers took, came to 675,000 sheep"
B'midbar,31,33,"72,000 cattle"

B'midbar,31,36,"The half which was the portion of the soldiers who went out to fight, numbered 337,500 sheep"
B'midbar,31,37,of which ADONAI’s tribute was 675
B'midbar,31,38,"36,000 cattle, of which ADONAI’s tribute was seventy-two"

B'midbar,31,41,"Moshe gave the tribute set apart for ADONAI to El‘azar the cohen, as ADONAI had ordered Moshe.
(LY: v)"
B'midbar,31,42,"From the half that went to people of Isra’el, which Moshe separated from that of the men who had gone to fight "

B'midbar,31,46,"and 16,000 persons "
B'midbar,31,47,"from the people of Isra’el’s half, Moshe took one-fiftieth of the persons and animals and gave them to the L’vi’im taking care of the tabernacle of ADONAI, as ADONAI had ordered Moshe."
B'midbar,31,48,"The officers in charge of the thousands who fought, the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds, approached Moshe"
B'midbar,31,49,"and said to him, “Your servants have counted all the soldiers under our command, and not one of us is missing."
B'midbar,31,50,"We have brought an offering for ADONAI, what every man has obtained in the way of gold jewelry — armlets, bracelets, signet rings, earrings and belts — to make atonement for ourselves before ADONAI.”"
B'midbar,31,51,"Moshe and El‘azar the cohen accepted their gold, all the jewelry."
B'midbar,31,52,All the gold in this gift which the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds set apart for ADONAI weighed 420 pounds.
B'midbar,31,53,"For the soldiers had taken booty, every man for himself."
B'midbar,31,54,Moshe and El‘azar the cohen took the gold from the commanders of thousands and of hundreds and brought it into the tent of meeting as a reminder for the people of Isra’el before ADONAI.
B'midbar,32,1,(RY: iii; LY: vi) The descendants of Re’uven and the descendants of Gad had vast quantities of livestock. When they saw that the land of Ya‘zer and the land of Gil‘ad were good for livestock
B'midbar,32,2,"the descendants of Gad and of Re’uven came and spoke to Moshe, El‘azar the cohen and the community leaders. They said"
B'midbar,32,3,"“‘Atarot, Divon, Ya‘zer, Nimrah, Heshbon, El‘aleh, S’vam, N’vo and Be‘on"
B'midbar,32,4,"the country that ADONAI conquered before the community of Isra’el, is livestock country; and your servants have livestock."
B'midbar,32,5,"If you regard us favorably,” they went on, “let this land be given to your servants as their possession; and don’t have us cross the Yarden.”"
B'midbar,32,6,Moshe answered the descendants of Gad and of Re’uven: “Are your brothers to go to war while you stay here?
B'midbar,32,7,"Besides, why are you trying to discourage the people of Isra’el from crossing into the land ADONAI gave them?"
B'midbar,32,8,This is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh-Barnea to see the land.
B'midbar,32,9,"For when they went up to the Eshkol Valley and saw the land, they disheartened the people of Isra’el, so that they wouldn’t enter the land ADONAI had given them."
B'midbar,32,10,ADONAI’s anger blazed up on that day; and he swore
B'midbar,32,11,"‘None of the people aged twenty or more who came out of Egypt will see the land I swore to Avraham, Yitz’chak and Ya‘akov; because they haven’t followed me unreservedly "
B'midbar,32,12,"except Kalev the son of Y’funeh the K’nizi and Y’hoshua the son of Nun, because they have followed ADONAI unreservedly.’"
B'midbar,32,13,"Thus ADONAI’s anger blazed against Isra’el, so that he made them wander here and there in the desert forty years, until all the generation that had done evil in the sight of ADONAI had died out."
B'midbar,32,14,"Now you, another brood of sinners, have arisen in your fathers’ place to increase still more the fierce anger of ADONAI toward Isra’el!"
B'midbar,32,15,"For if you turn away from him, he will leave them in the desert again, and thus you will cause the destruction of all these people!”"
B'midbar,32,16,"But they came up to him and said, “Here we will build enclosures for our livestock and cities for our little ones"
B'midbar,32,17,"but we ourselves will be armed and ready for action to march at the head of the people of Isra’el, until we have brought them to their place. Our little ones will stay in the fortified cities here because of the people now living in the land."
B'midbar,32,18,"However, we will not return to our own homes until every man in Isra’el has taken possession of his land for inheritance."
B'midbar,32,19,"We will not have an inheritance with them on the other side of the Yarden, westward; because our inheritance has fallen to us on this side of the Yarden, eastward.”
(RY: iv, LY: vii)"
B'midbar,32,20,"Moshe said to them, “If you will do this — if you will arm yourselves to go before ADONAI to the war"
B'midbar,32,21,"and if every one of your soldiers will cross the Yarden before ADONAI, until he has driven out his enemies ahead of him"
B'midbar,32,22,"and if the land has been conquered before ADONAI, and only after that do you return — then you will be clear before ADONAI and before Isra’el, and this land here will be yours to possess before ADONAI."
B'midbar,32,23,"But if you will not do this, then you have sinned against ADONAI, and you must understand that your sin will find you out."
B'midbar,32,24,Build cities for your little ones and enclosures for your sheep; then do what you said you would do.”
B'midbar,32,25,"The descendants of Gad and the descendants of Re’uven said to Moshe, “Your servants will do as my lord orders."
B'midbar,32,26,"Our little ones, wives, flocks and all our livestock will be there in the cities of Gil‘ad"
B'midbar,32,27,"but your servants will cross over, every man armed for war, before ADONAI to do battle, as my lord says.”"
B'midbar,32,28,"So Moshe gave orders concerning them to El‘azar the cohen, Y’hoshua the son of Nun and the clan leaders of the tribes of the people of Isra’el."
B'midbar,32,29,"Moshe said to them, “If the descendants of Gad and of Re’uven cross over the Yarden with you, every man armed for battle, before ADONAI; and if the land is conquered before you, then you are to give them the land of Gil‘ad as theirs to possess."
B'midbar,32,30,"But if they do not cross with you armed, they are to possess land along with you in Kena‘an.”"
B'midbar,32,31,"The descendants of Gad and of Re’uven answered, “We will do as ADONAI has said to your servants."
B'midbar,32,32,"We will cross over into the land of Kena‘an armed before ADONAI, and the land we will possess for inheritance will be on this side of the Yarden.”"
B'midbar,32,33,"So Moshe gave the descendants of Gad and of Re’uven, and also to the half-tribe of M’nasheh the son of Yosef, the kingdom of Sichon king of the Emori and the kingdom of ‘Og king of Bashan — the country and its cities within its borders, along with their surrounding towns."
B'midbar,32,34,"The descendants of Gad built Divon, ‘Atarot, ‘Aro‘er"
B'midbar,32,35,"‘Atrot-Shofan, Ya‘zer, Yogbehah"
B'midbar,32,36,Beit-Nimrah and Beit-Haran — fortified cities; and also enclosures for sheep.
B'midbar,32,37,"The descendants of Re’uven built Heshbon, El‘aleh, Kiryatayim"
B'midbar,32,38,"N’vo, Ba‘al-M‘on (these names have been changed) and Sivmah; they renamed the cities they built.
(LY: Maftir)"
B'midbar,32,39,"The descendants of Machir the son of M’nasheh went to Gil‘ad and conquered it, dispossessing the Emori who were there."
B'midbar,32,40,"Moshe gave Gil‘ad to Machir the son of M’nasheh, and he lived in it."
B'midbar,32,41,Ya’ir the son of M’nasheh went and captured its villages and called them Havot-Ya’ir [villages of Ya’ir].
B'midbar,32,42,"Novach went and captured K’nat with its villages and named it Novach after himself.

B'midbar,33,1,These are the stages in the journey of the people of Isra’el as they left the land of Egypt divided into groups under the leadership of Moshe and Aharon.
B'midbar,33,2,Moshe recorded each of the stages of their journey by order of ADONAI ; here are the starting-points of each stage
B'midbar,33,3,"They began their journey from Ram’ses in the first month. On the fifteenth day of the first month, the morning after the Pesach, the people of Isra’el left proudly in view of all the Egyptians"
B'midbar,33,4,"while the Egyptians were burying those among them whom ADONAI had killed, all their firstborn; ADONAI had also executed judgment on their gods."
B'midbar,33,5,The people of Isra’el moved on from Ram’ses and camped at Sukkot.
B'midbar,33,6,"They moved on from Sukkot and camped at Etam, by the edge of the desert."
B'midbar,33,7,"They moved on from Etam and turned back to Pi-Hachirot, in front of Ba‘al-Tz’fon, and camped before Migdol."
B'midbar,33,8,"They moved on from P’nei-Hachirot, passed through the sea to the desert, continued three days’ journey into the Etam Desert and camped at Marah."
B'midbar,33,9,"They moved on from Marah and came to Eilim; in Eilim were twelve springs and seventy palm trees, so they camped there."
B'midbar,33,10,"They moved on from Eilim and camped by the Sea of Suf.
(LY: ii)"
B'midbar,33,11,They moved on from the Sea of Suf and camped in the Seen Desert.
B'midbar,33,12,They moved on from the Seen Desert and camped at Dofkah.
B'midbar,33,13,They moved on from Dofkah and camped at Alush.

B'midbar,33,33,They moved on from Hor-HaGidgad and camped at Yotvatah.
B'midbar,33,34,They moved on from Yotvatah and camped at Avronah.
B'midbar,33,35,They moved on from Avronah and camped at ‘Etzyon-Gever.
B'midbar,33,36,"They moved on from ‘Etzyon-Gever and camped in the Tzin Desert, that is, Kadesh."
B'midbar,33,37,"They moved on from Kadesh and camped at Mount Hor, at the border of the land of Edom."
B'midbar,33,38,"At ADONAI’s order Aharon the cohen went up on Mount Hor, and he died there on the first day of the fifth month of the fortieth year after the people of Isra’el had left the land of Egypt."
B'midbar,33,39,Aharon was 123 years old when he died on Mount Hor.
B'midbar,33,40,"The Kena‘ani king of ‘Arad, who lived in the Negev in the land of Kena‘an, had heard that the people of Isra’el were coming"
B'midbar,33,41,so they moved on from Mount Hor and camped at Tzalmonah.
B'midbar,33,42,They moved on from Tzalmonah and camped at Punon.
B'midbar,33,43,They moved on from Punon and camped at Ovot.

B'midbar,33,45,They moved on from ‘Iyim and camped at Divon-Gad.
B'midbar,33,46,They moved on from Divon-Gad and camped at ‘Almon-Divlatayim.
B'midbar,33,47,"They moved on from Almon-Divlatayim and camped in the ‘Avarim Range, in front of N’vo."
B'midbar,33,48,"They moved on from the ‘Avarim Range and camped in the plains of Mo’av by the Yarden, across from Yericho."
B'midbar,33,49,"Their camp by the Yarden extended from Beit-HaYeshimot all the way to Avel-HaSheetim in the plains of Mo’av.
(RY: v; LY: iii)"
B'midbar,33,50,"ADONAI spoke to Moshe in the plains of Mo’av by the Yarden, across from Yericho. He said"
B'midbar,33,51,"to tell the people of Isra’el, “When you cross the Yarden into the land of Kena‘an"
B'midbar,33,52,"you are to expel all the people living in the land from in front of you. Destroy all their stone figures, destroy all their metal statues and demolish all their high places."
B'midbar,33,53,"Drive out the inhabitants of the land, and live in it, for I have given the land to you to possess."
B'midbar,33,54,"You will inherit the land by lot according to your families. You are to give more land to the larger families and less to the smaller ones. Wherever the lot falls to any particular person, that will be his property. You will inherit according to the tribes of your ancestors."
B'midbar,33,55,"But if you don’t drive out the inhabitants of the land from in front of you, then those you allow to remain will become like thorns in your eyes and stings in your sides — they will harass you in the land where you are living."
B'midbar,33,56,"And in this event, I will do to you what I intended to do to them.”"
B'midbar,34,1,ADONAI told Moshe
B'midbar,34,2,"to give this order to the people of Isra’el: “When you enter the land of Kena‘an, it will become your land to pass on as an inheritance, the land of Kena‘an as defined by these borders."
B'midbar,34,3,“Your southern portion will extend from the Tzin Desert close to the border of Edom. The eastern terminus of your southern border is at the end of the Dead Sea.
B'midbar,34,4,"From there your border turns, goes south of the ‘Akrabbim Ascent and passes on to Tzin. From there it goes south of Kadesh-Barnea, on to Hatzar-Adar, and on to ‘Atzmon."
B'midbar,34,5,Then the border turns and goes from ‘Atzmon to the Vadi of Egypt and along it to the Sea.
B'midbar,34,6,“Your western border will be the Great Sea.
B'midbar,34,7,“Your northern border will be as follows: from the Great Sea mark a line to Mount Hor
B'midbar,34,8,and from Mount Hor mark a line to the entrance of Hamat. The border goes out to Tz’dad.
B'midbar,34,9,Then the border goes to Zifron and finally to Hatzar-‘Einan; this is your northern border.
B'midbar,34,10,“For the eastern border mark your line from Hatzar-‘Enan to Sh’fam.
B'midbar,34,11,"Then the border goes down from Sh’fam to Rivlah, on the east side of ‘Ayin, then down until it hits the slope east of Lake Kinneret."
B'midbar,34,12,From there it goes down the Yarden River till it flows into the Dead Sea. These will be the borders of your land.”
B'midbar,34,13,"Moshe gave this order to the people of Isra’el: “This is the land in which you will receive inheritances by lot, which ADONAI has ordered to give to the nine tribes and the half-tribe."
B'midbar,34,14,"The tribe of the descendants of Re’uven have already received their land for inheritance according to their clans, and so have the descendants of Gad and the half-tribe of M’nasheh."
B'midbar,34,15,"These two-and-a-half tribes have received their inheritance on this side of the Yarden, across from Yericho and eastward, toward the sunrise.”
(RY: vi; LY: iv)"
B'midbar,34,16,ADONAI said to Moshe
B'midbar,34,17,“These are the names of the men who will take possession of the land for you: El‘azar the cohen and Y’hoshua the son of Nun.
B'midbar,34,18,Also appoint one leader from each tribe to take possession of the land.
B'midbar,34,19,"The names of these men are:
from the tribe of Y’hudah, Kalev the son of Y’funeh"
B'midbar,34,20,"from the tribe of the descendants of Shim‘on, Sh’mu’el the son of ‘Ammihud"
B'midbar,34,21,"from the tribe of Binyamin, Elidad the son of Kislon"
B'midbar,34,22,"from the tribe of the descendants of Dan, a leader, Buki the son of Yogli"
B'midbar,34,23,"from the descendants of Yosef:
from the tribe of the descendants of M’nasheh, a leader, Hani’el the son of Efod"
B'midbar,34,24,"from the tribe of the descendants of Efrayim, a leader, K’mu’el the son of Shiftan"
B'midbar,34,25,"from the tribe of the descendants of Z’vulun, a leader, Elitzafan the son of Parnakh"
B'midbar,34,26,"from the tribe of the descendants of Yissakhar, a leader, Palti’el the son of ‘Azan"
B'midbar,34,27,"from the tribe of the descendants of Asher, a leader, Achihud the son of Shlomi"
B'midbar,34,28,"from the tribe of the descendants of Naftali, a leader, P’dah’el the son of ‘Ammihud.”"
B'midbar,34,29,These are the ones whom ADONAI ordered to divide the inheritance among the people of Isra’el in the land of Kena‘an.
B'midbar,35,1,"(LY: v) In the plains of Mo’av by the Yarden, across from Yericho, ADONAI said to Moshe"
B'midbar,35,2,"“Order the people of Isra’el to give to the L’vi’im cities to live in from the heritage they will possess, and you are also to give the L’vi’im some of the open land surrounding the cities."
B'midbar,35,3,"They are to have the cities to live in, while their open land will be for their livestock, for growing crops and for all their animals."
B'midbar,35,4,"The open land around the cities you give to the L’vi’im is to commence at a line drawn around the city wall 1,500 feet outside it and is to extend outward from there."
B'midbar,35,5,"Measure 3,000 feet outward from the city wall to the east, south, west and north, with the city in the center. The space between the 1,500-foot line and the 3,000-foot line will be their open land around the cities."
B'midbar,35,6,The cities you give to the L’vi’im are to be the six cities of refuge to which you permit the person who kills someone to flee to; plus an additional forty-two cities.
B'midbar,35,7,"Thus you will give the L’vi’im forty-eight cities, with their surrounding open land."
B'midbar,35,8,"As to the cities you will give from those the people of Isra’el possess, from the many you will take many, and from the few you will take few — each tribe will contribute from its cities to the L’vi’im in accordance with the size of its inheritance.”
(RY: vii, LY: vi)"
B'midbar,35,9,ADONAI said to Moshe
B'midbar,35,10,"“Tell the people of Isra’el, ‘When you cross the Yarden into the land of Kena‘an"
B'midbar,35,11,"you are to designate for yourselves cities that will be cities of refuge for you, to which anyone who kills someone by mistake can flee."
B'midbar,35,12,"These cities are to be a refuge for you from the dead person’s next-of-kin, who might otherwise avenge his kinsman’s death by slaying the killer prior to his standing trial before the community."
B'midbar,35,13,"In regard to the cities you are to give, there are to be six cities of refuge for you."
B'midbar,35,14,You are to give three cities east of the Yarden and three cities in the land of Kena‘an; they will be cities of refuge.
B'midbar,35,15,"These six cities will serve as refuge for the people of Isra’el, as well as for the foreigner and resident alien with them; so that anyone who kills someone by mistake may flee there."
B'midbar,35,16,"“‘However, if he hits him with an iron implement and thus causes his death, he is a murderer; the murderer must be put to death."
B'midbar,35,17,"Or if he hits him with a stone in his hand big enough to kill someone, and he dies, he is a murderer; the murderer must be put to death."
B'midbar,35,18,"Or if he hits him with a wood utensil in his hand capable of killing someone, and he dies, he is a murderer; the murderer must be put to death."
B'midbar,35,19,"The next-of-kin avenger is to put the murderer to death himself — upon meeting him, he is to put him to death."
B'midbar,35,20,"Likewise, if he shoves him out of hatred; or intentionally throws something at him, causing his death"
B'midbar,35,21,"or out of hostility strikes him with his hand, so that he dies; then the one who struck him must be put to death; he is a murderer; and the next-of-kin avenger is to put the murderer to death upon meeting him."
B'midbar,35,22,"“‘But suppose he shoves him suddenly, but without hostility; or he throws something at him unintentionally"
B'midbar,35,23,"or, without seeing him, being his enemy or seeking to harm him, he throws a stone big enough to cause death; and the person dies."
B'midbar,35,24,Then the community is to judge between the one who struck him and the next-of-kin avenger in accordance with these rules
B'midbar,35,25,"and the community is to save the killer from the next-of-kin avenger. The community is to return him to the city of refuge to which he fled, and he is to live there until the cohen hagadol, who was anointed with the holy oil, dies."
B'midbar,35,26,But if the killer ever goes beyond the limits of the city of refuge he fled to
B'midbar,35,27,"and the next-of-kin avenger finds him outside the limits of his city of refuge, and the avenger kills the killer, he will not be guilty of the man’s blood"
B'midbar,35,28,because he must stay in his city of refuge until the death of the cohen hagadol. But after the death of the cohen hagadol the killer may return to the land he owns.
B'midbar,35,29,"These things shall constitute your standard for judgment through all your generations, wherever you live."
B'midbar,35,30,"“‘If anyone kills someone, the murderer is to be put to death upon the testimony of witnesses; but the testimony of only one witness will not suffice to cause a person to be put to death."
B'midbar,35,31,"Also, you are not to accept a ransom in lieu of the life of a murderer condemned to death; rather, he must be put to death."
B'midbar,35,32,"Likewise, you are not to accept for someone who has fled to his city of refuge a ransom that would allow him to return to his land before the death of the cohen."
B'midbar,35,33,"In this way you will not defile the land in which you are living. For blood defiles the land, and in this land no atonement can be made for the blood shed in it except the blood of him who shed it."
B'midbar,35,34,"No, you are not to defile the land in which you live and in which I live; for I, ADONAI, live among the people of Isra’el.’”"
B'midbar,36,1,"(LY: vii) The leaders of the clans of the family of the descendants of Gil‘ad, the son of Machir, the son of M’nasheh, of the families of the descendants of Yosef, approached and addressed Moshe and the leaders, the heads of the clans of the people of Isra’el."
B'midbar,36,2,"They said, “ADONAI ordered my lord to give by lot the land to be inherited by the people of Isra’el, and my lord was ordered by ADONAI to give the inheritance of our kinsman Tz’lof’chad to his daughters."
B'midbar,36,3,"But if they get married to anyone belonging to another of the tribes of the people of Isra’el, then their inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance of our ancestors and be added to the inheritance of the tribe they will then belong to; thus it will be taken away from the sum total of our inheritance."
B'midbar,36,4,"And when the yovel of the people of Isra’el comes, their inheritance will be added to the land possessed by the tribe they will then belong to and be subtracted from the inheritance belonging to the tribe of our ancestors.”"
B'midbar,36,5,"Moshe gave this order to the people of Isra’el, in keeping with the word of ADONAI : “The tribe of the descendants of Yosef is right in what it says."
B'midbar,36,6,"Here is what ADONAI has ordered concerning the daughters of Tz’lof’chad: ‘Let them be married to whomever they think best, but they must marry only into a family from their father’s tribe."
B'midbar,36,7,In this way no inheritance of the people of Isra’el will move from one tribe to another; for each of the people of Isra’el is to hold on to the land for inheritance belonging to his father’s tribe.
B'midbar,36,8,"Every daughter who possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the people of Isra’el is to become the wife of someone from the family of her father’s tribe, so that every one of the people of Isra’el will stay in possession of his ancestors’ inheritance."
B'midbar,36,9,"Thus no inheritance will move from one tribe to another, for each of the tribes of the people of Isra’el will hold on to its own inheritance.”
(Maftir)"
B'midbar,36,10,The daughters of Tz’lof’chad did as ADONAI had ordered Moshe.
B'midbar,36,11,"Machlah, Tirtzah, Hoglah, Milkah and No‘ah all got married to sons of their father’s brothers."
