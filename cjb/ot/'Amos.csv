'Amos,1,1,"The words of ‘Amos, one of the sheep owners in T’koa, which he saw concerning Isra’el in the days of ‘Uziyah king of Y’hudah and Yarov‘am the son of Yo’ash, king of Isra’el, two years before the earthquake"
'Amos,1,2,"he said:
ADONAI is roaring from Tziyon
thundering from Yerushalayim;
the shepherds’ pastures will mourn,
and Mount Karmel’s summit will wither."
'Amos,1,3,"Here is what ADONAI says:
“For Dammesek’s three crimes,
no, four — I will not reverse it —
because they threshed Gil‘ad
with an iron-spiked threshing-sledge"
'Amos,1,4,"I will send fire to the house of Haza’el,
and it will consume the palaces of Ben-Hadad."
'Amos,1,5,"I will break the bars of Dammesek’s gates.
I will cut off the inhabitants from Bik‘at-Aven,
and him who holds the scepter from Beit-‘Eden.
Then the people of Aram will go into exile
in Kir,” says ADONAI."
'Amos,1,6,"Here is what ADONAI says:
“For ‘Azah’s three crimes,
no, four — I will not reverse it —
because they exiled a whole population
and handed them over to Edom"
'Amos,1,7,"I will send fire to the wall of ‘Azah,
and it will consume its palaces."
'Amos,1,8,"I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod,
and him who holds the scepter from Ashkelon.
I will turn my hand against ‘Ekron,
and the rest of the P’lishtim will perish,”
says ADONAI, God."
'Amos,1,9,"Here is what ADONAI says:
“For Tzor’s three crimes,
no, four — I will not reverse it —
because they exiled a whole population to Edom
and did not remember the covenant with kinsmen"
'Amos,1,10,"I will send fire to the wall of Tzor,
and it will consume its palaces.”"
'Amos,1,11,"Here is what ADONAI says:
“For Edom’s three crimes,
no, four — I will not reverse it —
because with sword he pursued his kinsman
and threw aside all pity,
constantly nursing his anger,
forever fomenting his fury"
'Amos,1,12,"I will send fire on Teman,
and it will consume the palaces of Botzrah.”"
'Amos,1,13,"Here is what ADONAI says:
“For the people of ‘Amon’s three crimes,
no, four — I will not reverse it —
because they ripped apart pregnant women
just to expand their territory"
'Amos,1,14,"I will set fire to the wall of Rabbah,
and it will consume its palaces
amid shouts on the day of battle,
amid a storm on the day of the whirlwind."
'Amos,1,15,"Their king will go into exile,
he and his princes together,” says ADONAI."
'Amos,2,1,"Here is what ADONAI says:
“For Mo’av’s three crimes,
no, four — I will not reverse it —
because he burned the bones of the king of Edom,
turning them into lime"
'Amos,2,2,"I will send fire on Mo’av,
and it will consume the palaces of K’riot.
Mo’av will die with turmoil and shouting,
along with the sound of the shofar."
'Amos,2,3,"I will cut off the judge from among them
and kill all his princes with him,” says ADONAI."
'Amos,2,4,"Here is what ADONAI says:
“For Y’hudah’s three crimes,
no, four — I will not reverse it —
because they rejected ADONAI’s Torah
and haven’t observed his laws,
and their lies caused them to fall into error
and live the way their ancestors did"
'Amos,2,5,"I will send fire on Y’hudah,
and it will consume the palaces of Yerushalayim."
'Amos,2,6,"Here is what ADONAI says:
“For Isra’el’s three crimes,
no, four — I will not reverse it —
because they sell the upright for silver
and the poor for a pair of shoes"
'Amos,2,7,"grinding the heads of the poor in the dust
and pushing the lowly out of the way;
father and son sleep with the same girl,
profaning my holy name"
'Amos,2,8,"lying down beside any altar
on clothes taken in pledge;
drinking wine in the house of their God
bought with fines they imposed."
'Amos,2,9,"“I destroyed the Emori before them;
though tall as cedars and strong as oaks,
I destroyed their fruit above
and their root below."
'Amos,2,10,"More than that, I brought you up from Egypt,
led you forty years in the desert,
so that you could have the Emori’s land."
'Amos,2,11,"I raised up some of your sons to be prophets,
other young men of yours to be n’zirim.
People of Isra’el!
Isn’t that true?” asks ADONAI."
'Amos,2,12,"But you gave the n’zirim wine to drink
and ordered the prophets, ‘Don’t prophesy!’"
'Amos,2,13,"“Enough! I will make all this crush you,
just as a cart overloaded with grain
crushes what’s under it."
'Amos,2,14,"Even the swift won’t be able to flee;
the strong won’t be able to use their strength,
the warriors won’t save themselves."
'Amos,2,15,"Archers won’t be able to stand,
the fastest runners won’t save themselves,
those on horses won’t save themselves."
'Amos,2,16,"On that day even the bravest warriors
will throw off their weapons and flee,” says ADONAI."
'Amos,3,1,"“Listen to this word which ADONAI has spoken against you, people of Isra’el, against the entire family that I brought up from the land of Egypt"
'Amos,3,2,"“Of all the families on earth,
only you have I intimately known.
This is why I will punish you
for all your crimes.”"
'Amos,3,3,"Do two people travel together
without having so agreed?"
'Amos,3,4,"Does a lion roar in the forest
when it has no prey?
Does a young lion growl in his lair
if it has caught nothing?"
'Amos,3,5,"Does a bird get caught in a trap on the ground
if it hasn’t been baited?
Does a trap spring up from the ground
when it has taken nothing?"
'Amos,3,6,"When the shofar is blown in the city,
don’t the people tremble?
Can disaster befall a city
without ADONAI’s having done it?"
'Amos,3,7,"ADONAI, God, does nothing without
revealing his plan to his servants the prophets."
'Amos,3,8,"The lion has roared. Who will not fear?
ADONAI, God, has spoken. Who will not prophesy?"
'Amos,3,9,"“Proclaim it on the palaces in Ashdod
and on the palaces in the land of Egypt; say:
‘Assemble yourselves on the hills of Shomron!
See what great tumult is seething within it,
how much oppression is being done there.’"
'Amos,3,10,"For they don’t know how to do right,” says ADONAI.
“They store up violence and robbery in their palaces.”"
'Amos,3,11,"Therefore, here is what Adonai ELOHIM says:
“An enemy will surround the land.
He will strip you of your strength,
and plunder your palaces.”"
'Amos,3,12,This is what ADONAI says
'Amos,3,13,"“As a shepherd rescues from the mouth of a lion
a couple of leg bones or a piece of an ear;
so the people of Isra’el in Shomron will be rescued,
huddled under cushions in the corners of their beds.
“Hear, and testify against the house of Ya‘akov,”
says Adonai ELOHIM Elohei-Tzva’ot."
'Amos,3,14,"“For when I punish Isra’el’s crimes,
I will also punish the altars of Beit-El.
The horns of the altar will be cut off,
and they will fall to the ground."
'Amos,3,15,"I will tear down winter houses
as well as summer houses;
houses adorned with ivory will be destroyed;
the mansions will be no more,” says ADONAI."
'Amos,4,1,"“Listen, you [lovely] cows of Bashan,
who live on Mount Shomron,
who oppress the poor and grind down the needy,
who say to their husbands, ‘Bring something to drink’"
'Amos,4,2,"Adonai ELOHIM has sworn by his holiness
that your time is surely coming.
“You will be dragged away with hooks,
the last of you with fishhooks."
'Amos,4,3,"You will leave through breaks in the wall,
each woman right behind the next,
and be sent off to Harmonah,” says ADONAI."
'Amos,4,4,"“Come to Beit-El, and commit crimes;
to Gilgal, and commit more crimes!
Bring your sacrifices in the morning
and your tithes after three days"
'Amos,4,5,"burn leavened bread as a thank offering;
brag in public about your voluntary offerings;
because that’s what you love to do, Isra’el!”
says Adonai ELOHIM."
'Amos,4,6,"“I made your teeth clean of food in all your cities,
left you nothing to eat in all your villages;
still you haven’t returned to me,” says ADONAI."
'Amos,4,7,"“I withheld the rain from you
three months before the harvest.
I made it rain on one city
and not on another —
one field had rain,
while another with no rain dried up"
'Amos,4,8,"from two or three cities they would stagger to one city
for water to drink, but there wasn’t enough;
still you haven’t returned to me,” says ADONAI."
'Amos,4,9,"“I struck your crops with hot winds and blight,
your many gardens and vineyards;
the cutter-worms devoured
your fig and olive trees;
still you haven’t returned to me,” says ADONAI."
'Amos,4,10,"“I sent a plague on you like that of Egypt,
put your young men to death with the sword;
let your horses be captured;
and filled your nostrils with the stench of your camps;
still you haven’t returned to me,” says ADONAI."
'Amos,4,11,"“I overthrew some of you,
as when God overthrew S’dom and ‘Amora;
you were like a burning stick snatched from the fire;
still you haven’t returned to me,” says ADONAI."
'Amos,4,12,"“This is why I will deal with you in this way, Isra’el;
and because I will deal with you in this way,
prepare to meet your God, Isra’el "
'Amos,4,13,"him who forms mountains and creates wind,
who declares to humankind his thoughts,
who turns the morning to darkness
and strides on the heights of the earth —
Adonai ELOHEI-Tzva’ot is his name.”"
'Amos,5,1,"Hear this word that I take up against you
in lament, house of Isra’el"
'Amos,5,2,"The virgin of Isra’el has fallen;
she will not rise again.
She lies abandoned on her own soil
with no one to lift her up."
'Amos,5,3,"For thus says Adonai ELOHIM:
“The city from which a thousand marched
will be left with a hundred,
and the one from which a hundred marched
will be left with ten
from the house of Isra’el.”"
'Amos,5,4,"For here is what ADONAI says
to the house of Isra’el:
“If you seek me, you will survive"
'Amos,5,5,"but don’t seek Beit-El, or enter Gilgal
or pass on into Be’er-Sheva;
for Gilgal will certainly go into exile,
and Beit-El will come to nothing.”"
'Amos,5,6,"If you seek ADONAI, you will survive.
Otherwise, he will break out against
the house of Yosef like fire,
devouring Beit-El,
with no one to quench the flames."
'Amos,5,7,"You who turn justice to bitter wormwood
and throw righteousness to the ground!"
'Amos,5,8,"He who made the Pleiades and Orion,
who brings deathlike shadows over the morning,
who darkens the day into night,
who calls for the water in the sea
and with it floods the earth —
ADONAI is his name "
'Amos,5,9,"he flashes destruction on the strong,
so that destruction overcomes the fortress."
'Amos,5,10,"They hate anyone promoting justice
at the city gate,
they detest anyone who speaks the truth."
'Amos,5,11,"Therefore, because you trample on the poor
and extort from them levies of grain;
although you have built houses of cut stone,
you will not live in them;
and though you have planted pleasant vineyards,
you will not drink their wine."
'Amos,5,12,"For I know how numerous are your crimes
and how outrageous your sins —
bullying the innocent, extorting ransoms
pushing the poor aside at the gate."
'Amos,5,13,"At times like these a prudent person stays silent,
for it is an evil time."
'Amos,5,14,"Seek good and not evil, so that you will survive.
Then Adonai ELOHEI-Tzva’ot will be with you,
as you say he is."
'Amos,5,15,"Hate evil, love good, and uphold justice at the gate.
Maybe Adonai ELOHEI-Tzva’ot
will take pity on the survivors of Yosef."
'Amos,5,16,"Therefore thus says Adonai ELOHEI-Tzva’ot, Adonai:
“In all public squares there will be lamentation,
in all the streets they will cry, ‘Oh, no!’
They will summon farmers to mourn
and professional mourners to wail."
'Amos,5,17,"There will be wailing in every vineyard,
for I will pass through among you,” says ADONAI."
'Amos,5,18,"Woe to you who want the Day of ADONAI!
Why do you want it, this Day of ADONAI?
It is darkness, not light"
'Amos,5,19,"as if someone were to run from a lion,
just to be met by a bear;
as if he entered a house, put his hand on the wall,
just to be bitten by a snake."
'Amos,5,20,"Won’t the Day of ADONAI be darkness, not light,
completely dark, with no brightness at all?"
'Amos,5,21,"“I hate, I utterly loathe your festivals;
I take no pleasure in your solemn assemblies."
'Amos,5,22,"If you offer me burnt offerings and grain offerings,
I will not accept them;
nor will I consider the peace offerings
of your stall-fed cattle."
'Amos,5,23,"Spare me the noise of your songs!
I don’t want to hear the strumming of your lutes!"
'Amos,5,24,"Instead, let justice well up like water,
and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream."
'Amos,5,25,"Did you bring me sacrifices and offerings
in the desert forty years, house of Isra’el?"
'Amos,5,26,"No, but now you will bear Sikkut as your king
and Kiyun, your images,
the star of your god, which you made for yourselves"
'Amos,5,27,"as I exile you beyond Dammesek,”
says Adonai ELOHEI-Tzva’ot —
that is his name."
'Amos,6,1,"Woe to those living at ease in Tziyon
and to those who feel complacent on the hills of Shomron,
renowned men in this foremost of nations,
to whom the rest of Isra’el come."
'Amos,6,2,"Travel to Kalneh and see;
from there go on to Hamat the great;
then go down to Gat of the P’lishtim.
Are you better than these kingdoms?
Is their territory larger than yours?"
'Amos,6,3,"You put off all thought of the evil day
but hasten the reign of violence."
'Amos,6,4,"You lie on beds of ivory
and lounge sprawled out on your couches,
dining on meat from lambs in the flock
and from calves fattened in stalls."
'Amos,6,5,"You make up wild songs at your parties,
playing the lute and inventing other instruments —
[imagining that you’re] like David!"
'Amos,6,6,"You drink wine by the bowlful
and anoint yourselves with the finest oils,
but feel no grief at the ruin of Yosef."
'Amos,6,7,"Therefore now they will be the first
to go into exile with those being exiled,
and the revelry of those who lounged,
sprawling, will pass away."
'Amos,6,8,"“Adonai ELOHIM swears by himself,”
says Adonai ELOHEI-Tzva’ot,
“I detest that Ya‘akov is so proud,
and I hate his palaces.
I will hand over the city,
along with everything in it.”"
'Amos,6,9,"When that day comes, if ten men remain in one house, they will die."
'Amos,6,10,"And if a [dead] man’s uncle, coming to bring the corpse out of the house and burn it, finds a survivor hidden in the inmost recesses of the house and asks, “Is anyone else there with you?” — then, when he receives the answer, “No,” he will say, “Don’t say any more, because we mustn’t mention the name of ADONAI.”"
'Amos,6,11,"For when ADONAI gives the order,
great houses will be shattered
and small houses reduced to rubble."
'Amos,6,12,"Do horses run on rock?
Does one plow there with oxen?
Yet you have turned justice into poison
and the fruit of righteousness into bitter wormwood."
'Amos,6,13,"You take pleasure in worthless things.
You think your power comes from your own strength."
'Amos,6,14,"“But I will raise up a nation against you, house of Isra’el,” says Adonai ELOHEI-Tzva’ot, “and they will oppress you from the entrance of Hamat to the Vadi of the ‘Aravah.”"
'Amos,7,1,"Here is what Adonai ELOHIM showed me: he was forming a swarm of locusts as the late crop was starting to come up, the late crop after the hay had been cut to pay the king’s tribute."
'Amos,7,2,"While they were finishing up eating all the vegetation in the land, I said,
“Adonai ELOHIM, forgive — please!
How will tiny Ya‘akov survive?”"
'Amos,7,3,"So ADONAI changed his mind about this. “It won’t happen,” ADONAI said."
'Amos,7,4,"Next Adonai ELOHIM showed me this: Adonai ELOHIM was summoning a blazing fire to consume the great abyss, and it would have devoured the land too."
'Amos,7,5,"But I said,
“Adonai ELOHIM, stop — please!
How will tiny Ya‘akov survive?”"
'Amos,7,6,"ADONAI changed his mind about it. “This too won’t happen,” said Adonai ELOHIM."
'Amos,7,7,"Then he showed me this: Adonai was standing by a wall made with a plumbline, and he had a plumbline in his hand."
'Amos,7,8,"ADONAI asked me, “‘Amos, what do you see?” I answered, “A plumbline.” Then Adonai said,
“I am going to put a plumbline in
among my people Isra’el;
I will never again overlook their offenses."
'Amos,7,9,"The high places of Yitz’chak will be desolate,
Isra’el’s sanctuaries will be destroyed,
and I will attack the house
of Yarov‘am with the sword.”"
'Amos,7,10,"Then Amatzyah the priest of Beit-El sent this message to Yarov‘am king of Isra’el, “‘Amos is conspiring against you there among the people of Isra’el, and the land can’t bear all that he’s saying."
'Amos,7,11,"For ‘Amos says: ‘Yarov‘am will die by the sword, and Isra’el will be led away from their land into exile.’”"
'Amos,7,12,"Amatzyah also said to ‘Amos, “Go away, seer! Go back to the land of Y’hudah! Earn your living there; and prophesy there"
'Amos,7,13,"but don’t prophesy any more at Beit-El; for this is the king’s sanctuary, a royal temple.”"
'Amos,7,14,"‘Amos gave this answer to Amatzyah: “I am not trained as a prophet, and I’m not one of the guild prophets — I own sheep and grow figs."
'Amos,7,15,"But ADONAI took me away from following the flock, and ADONAI said to me, ‘Go, prophesy to my people Isra’el.’"
'Amos,7,16,"So now, hear what ADONAI says: ‘You say, “Don’t prophesy against Isra’el, don’t lecture the people of Yitz’chak.”’"
'Amos,7,17,"Therefore ADONAI says this:
‘Your wife will become a whore in the city,
your sons and daughters will die by the sword,
your land will be parcelled out with a measuring line,
you yourself will die in an unclean land,
and Isra’el will certainly be exiled from their land.’”"
'Amos,8,1,Here is what Adonai ELOHIM showed me: there in front of me was a basket of summer fruit.
'Amos,8,2,"He asked, “‘Amos, what do you see?” I answered, “A basket of summer fruit.” Then ADONAI said to me,
“The end has come for my people,
I will never again overlook their offenses."
'Amos,8,3,"When that time comes, the songs in the temple
will be wailings,” says Adonai ELOHIM.
“There will be many dead bodies;
everywhere silence will reign.”"
'Amos,8,4,"Listen, you who swallow the needy
and destroy the poor of the land!"
'Amos,8,5,"You say, “When will Rosh-Hodesh be over,
so we can market our grain?
and Shabbat, so we can sell wheat?”
You measure the grain in a small eifah,
but the silver in heavy shekels,
fixing the scales, so that you can cheat"
'Amos,8,6,"buying the needy for money
and the poor for a pair of shoes,
and sweeping up the refuse of the wheat to sell!”"
'Amos,8,7,"ADONAI swears by Ya‘akov’s pride,
“I will forget none of their deeds, ever."
'Amos,8,8,"Won’t the land tremble for this,
and everyone mourn, who lives in the land?
It will all rise, just like the Nile,
be in turmoil and subside, like the Nile in Egypt."
'Amos,8,9,"“When that time comes,” says Adonai ELOHIM,
“I will make the sun go down at noon
and darken the earth in broad daylight."
'Amos,8,10,"I will turn your festivals into mourning
and all your songs into wailing;
I will make you all put sackcloth around your waists
and shave your heads bald in grief.
I will make it like mourning for an only son
and its end like a bitter day."
'Amos,8,11,"“The time is coming,” says Adonai ELOHIM,
“when I will send famine over the land,
not a famine of bread or a thirst for water,
but of hearing the words of ADONAI."
'Amos,8,12,"People will stagger from sea to sea
and from north to east, running back and forth,
seeking the word of ADONAI;
but they will not find it."
'Amos,8,13,"When that time comes, young women and men
will faint from thirst."
'Amos,8,14,"Those who swear by the sin of Shomron,
who say, ‘As your god, Dan, lives,’
and, ‘As the way of Be’er-Sheva lives’ —
they will fall and never get up again.”"
'Amos,9,1,"I saw Adonai standing beside the altar, and he said,
“Strike the tops of the columns until the thresholds shake!
Smash them to pieces on the heads of all the people!
Those who remain I will kill with the sword;
not one of them will succeed in fleeing,
not one of them will escape."
'Amos,9,2,"If they dig down to Sh’ol,
my hand will haul them out;
if they climb up to heaven,
I will bring them down."
'Amos,9,3,"If they hide themselves on the top of the Karmel,
I will search them out and capture them there;
If they hide from me at the bottom of the sea,
I will order the serpent to bite them there."
'Amos,9,4,"If their enemies herd them into exile,
I will order the sword to kill them there.
I will fix my gaze on them
for harm and not for good.”"
'Amos,9,5,"For Adonai ELOHIM-Tzva’ot
is the one who can melt the earth with his touch,
and make all who live on it mourn.
It will all rise, just like the Nile,
and then subside, like the Nile in Egypt."
'Amos,9,6,"He builds his upper rooms in heaven
and establishes his sky-vault over the earth.
He summons the waters of the sea
and pours them out over the earth.
ADONAI is his name."
'Amos,9,7,"“People of Isra’el, are you any different
from the Ethiopians to me?” asks ADONAI.
“True, I brought Isra’el up from Egypt,
but I also brought the P’lishtim from Kaftor,
and Aram from Kir."
'Amos,9,8,"Look, the eyes of Adonai ELOHIM
are on the sinful kingdom.
I will wipe it off the face of the earth,
yet I will not completely destroy
the house of Ya‘akov,” says ADONAI."
'Amos,9,9,"“For when I give the order,
I will shake the house of Isra’el,
there among all the Goyim,
as one shakes with a sieve,
letting no grain fall to the ground."
'Amos,9,10,"All the sinners among my people
who say, ‘Disaster will never overtake us
or confront us,’ will die by the sword."
'Amos,9,11,"“When that day comes, I will raise up
the fallen sukkah of David.
I will close up its gaps, raise up its ruins
and rebuild it as it used to be"
'Amos,9,12,"so that Isra’el can possess
what is left of Edom
and of all the nations bearing my name,”
says ADONAI, who is doing this."
'Amos,9,13,"“The days will come,” says ADONAI,
“when the plowman will overtake the reaper
and the one treading grapes the one sowing seed.
Sweet wine will drip down the mountains,
and all the hills will flow with it."
'Amos,9,14,"I will restore the fortunes of my people Isra’el;
they will rebuild and inhabit the ruined cities;
they will plant vineyards and drink their wine,
cultivate gardens and eat their fruit."
'Amos,9,15,"I will plant them on their own soil,
no more to be uprooted
from their land, which I gave them,”
says ADONAI your God."
