Shir-HaShirim,1,1,"The Ultimate Song, by Shlomo"
Shir-HaShirim,1,2,"Let him smother me with kisses from his mouth,
for your love is better than wine."
Shir-HaShirim,1,3,"Your anointing oils have a wonderful fragrance;
your name is like anointing oil poured out.
This is why young women love you "
Shir-HaShirim,1,4,"“Take me with you. We will run after you.”
The king has brought me into his rooms.
We will be glad and rejoice for you.
We will praise your love more than wine.
How right it is for them to love you!"
Shir-HaShirim,1,5,"I am dark tan but beautiful,
you daughters of Yerushalayim,
like the tents of Kedar,
like the curtains of Shlomo."
Shir-HaShirim,1,6,"Don’t stare at me because I’m dark;
it’s the sun that tanned me.
My mother’s sons were angry with me
and made me look after the vineyards.
But I haven’t cared for my own vineyard."
Shir-HaShirim,1,7,"Tell me, my love, where you pasture your flock,
where you have them rest at noon;
for why should I veil myself [like a whore]
beside the flocks of your friends?"
Shir-HaShirim,1,8,"If you do not know,
you most beautiful of women,
then follow the footprints of the flock
and let your kids graze by the shepherds’ tents."
Shir-HaShirim,1,9,"My love, I compare you with my mare,
pulling one of Pharaoh’s chariots "
Shir-HaShirim,1,10,"your cheeks are lovely with ornaments,
your neck with its strings of beads"
Shir-HaShirim,1,11,"we will make you ornaments
of gold, studded with silver."
Shir-HaShirim,1,12,"As the king reclines at table,
my nard gives forth its perfume"
Shir-HaShirim,1,13,"to me the man I love is a sachet of myrrh
lodged between my breasts"
Shir-HaShirim,1,14,"to me the man I love is a spray of henna flowers
in the vineyards of ‘Ein-Gedi."
Shir-HaShirim,1,15,"Look at you, my love! How beautiful you are!
Your eyes are doves "
Shir-HaShirim,1,16,"— Look at you!
So handsome, so pleasing, my darling!
Our bed is the greenery"
Shir-HaShirim,1,17,"cedars are the beams of our houses,
cypresses the rafters."
Shir-HaShirim,2,1,"I am but a rose from the Sharon,
just a lily in the valleys."
Shir-HaShirim,2,2,"Like a lily among thorns
is my darling among the other women."
Shir-HaShirim,2,3,"Like an apple tree among the other trees in the forest
is my darling among the other men.
I love to sit in his shadow;
his fruit is sweet to my taste."
Shir-HaShirim,2,4,"He brings me to the banquet hall;
his banner over me is love."
Shir-HaShirim,2,5,"Sustain me with raisins, refresh me with apples,
for I am sick with love."
Shir-HaShirim,2,6,"[I wish] his left arm [were] under my head,
and his right arm around me."
Shir-HaShirim,2,7,"I warn you, daughters of Yerushalayim,
by the gazelles and deer in the wilds,
not to awaken or stir up love
until it wants to arise!"
Shir-HaShirim,2,8,"The voice of the man I love! Here he comes,
bounding over the mountains, skipping over the hills!"
Shir-HaShirim,2,9,"My darling is like a gazelle or young stag.
There he is, standing outside our wall,
looking in through the windows,
peering in through the lattice."
Shir-HaShirim,2,10,"My darling speaks; he is saying to me,
“Get up, my love! My beauty! Come away!"
Shir-HaShirim,2,11,"For you see that the winter has passed,
the rain is finished and gone"
Shir-HaShirim,2,12,"the flowers are appearing in the countryside,
the time has come for [the birds] to sing,
and the cooing of doves can be heard in the land."
Shir-HaShirim,2,13,"The fig trees are forming their unripe figs,
and the grapevines in bloom give out their perfume.
Get up, my love, my beauty!
Come away!”"
Shir-HaShirim,2,14,"My dove, hiding in holes in the rock,
in the secret recesses of the cliff,
let me see your face and hear your voice;
for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely."
Shir-HaShirim,2,15,"“Catch the foxes for us,
yes, the little foxes!
They are ruining the vineyards
when our vineyards are in bloom!”"
Shir-HaShirim,2,16,"My darling is mine, and I am his,
as he pastures his flock among the lilies."
Shir-HaShirim,2,17,"Before the daytime breeze rises
and the shadows flee,
return, my love, like a stag or gazelle
on the hills of Beter."
Shir-HaShirim,3,1,"Night after night on my bed
I looked for the man I love.
I looked for him, but I didn’t find him."
Shir-HaShirim,3,2,"“I will get up now and roam the city,
through the streets and the open places,
I will look for the man I love.”
I looked for him, but I didn’t find him."
Shir-HaShirim,3,3,"The guards roaming the city found me.
“Have you seen the man I love?”"
Shir-HaShirim,3,4,"Scarcely had I left them,
when I found the man I love.
I took hold of him
and would not let him go
until I had brought him to my mother’s house,
to the bedroom of the woman who conceived me."
Shir-HaShirim,3,5,"I warn you, daughters of Yerushalayim,
by the gazelles and deer in the wilds,
not to awaken or stir up love
until it wants to arise!"
Shir-HaShirim,3,6,"Who is this, coming up from the desert
like a column of smoke,
perfumed with myrrh and frankincense,
chosen from the merchant’s crushed spices?"
Shir-HaShirim,3,7,"It is Shlomo’s litter,
escorted by sixty valiant men
chosen from Isra’el’s finest"
Shir-HaShirim,3,8,"all of them wield the sword
and are expert fighters;
each one has his sword ready at his side
to combat the terrors of night."
Shir-HaShirim,3,9,"King Shlomo made himself a royal litter
of wood from the L’vanon."
Shir-HaShirim,3,10,"He made its columns of silver,
its roof of gold, its seat of purple cloth;
its inside was lovingly inlaid
by the daughters of Yerushalayim."
Shir-HaShirim,3,11,"Daughters of Tziyon, come out,
and gaze upon King Shlomo,
wearing the crown with which his mother crowned him
on his wedding day, his day of joy!"
Shir-HaShirim,4,1,"How beautiful you are, my love!
How beautiful you are!
Your eyes are doves behind your veil.
Your hair is like a flock of goats
streaming down Mount Gil‘ad."
Shir-HaShirim,4,2,"Your teeth are like a flock of shorn sheep
that have just come up from being washed;
each of them is matched,
and none of them is missing."
Shir-HaShirim,4,3,"Your lips are like a scarlet thread,
and your mouth is lovely.
Your cheeks are like a pomegranate
split open behind your veil."
Shir-HaShirim,4,4,"Your neck is like the tower of David,
built magnificently,
on which hang a thousand bucklers,
each one a brave warrior’s shield."
Shir-HaShirim,4,5,"Your two breasts are like two fawns,
twins of a gazelle grazing among lilies."
Shir-HaShirim,4,6,"When the day’s cool breeze comes up
and the shadows lengthen,
I will get myself to the mountain of myrrh
to the hill of frankincense."
Shir-HaShirim,4,7,"Everything about you is beautiful, my love;
you are without a flaw."
Shir-HaShirim,4,8,"Come with me from the L’vanon, my bride,
come with me from the L’vanon.
Come down from the heights of Amanah,
from the heights of S’nir and Hermon,
down from the lions’ lairs
and the leopard-haunted hills."
Shir-HaShirim,4,9,"My sister, my bride,
you have carried my heart away!
With just one glance, with one bead of your necklace
you have carried my heart away."
Shir-HaShirim,4,10,"My sister, my bride,
how sweet is your love!
How much better your love than wine,
more fragrant your perfumes than any spice!"
Shir-HaShirim,4,11,"Your lips, my bride, drip honey;
honey and milk are under your tongue;
and the scent of your garments is like
the scent of the L’vanon."
Shir-HaShirim,4,12,"My sister, my bride, is a garden locked up,
a pool covered over, a spring sealed shut."
Shir-HaShirim,4,13,"You are an orchard that puts forth pomegranates
and other precious fruits, henna and nard "
Shir-HaShirim,4,14,"nard, saffron and aromatic cane,
cinnamon and all kinds of frankincense trees,
myrrh, aloes, all the best spices."
Shir-HaShirim,4,15,"You are a garden fountain,
a spring of running water,
flowing down from the L’vanon."
Shir-HaShirim,4,16,"Awake, north wind! Come, south wind!
Blow on my garden to spread its fragrance.
Let my darling enter his garden
and eat its finest fruit."
Shir-HaShirim,5,1,"My sister, my bride, I have entered my garden;
I am gathering my myrrh and my spices;
I am eating my honeycomb along with my honey;
I am drinking my wine as well as my milk.
Eat, friends, and drink,
until you are drunk with love!"
Shir-HaShirim,5,2,"I am asleep, but my heart is awake.
Listen! I hear my darling knocking!
Open for me, my sister, my love,
my dove, my flawless one!
For my head is wet with dew,
my hair with the moisture of the night."
Shir-HaShirim,5,3,"I’ve removed my coat; must I put it back on?
I’ve washed my feet; must I dirty them again?"
Shir-HaShirim,5,4,"The man I love put his hand through the hole by the door-latch,
and my heart began pounding at the thought of him."
Shir-HaShirim,5,5,"I got up to open for the man I love.
My hands were dripping with myrrh —
pure myrrh ran off my fingers
onto the handle of the bolt."
Shir-HaShirim,5,6,"I opened for my darling,
but my darling had turned and gone.
My heart had failed me when he spoke —
I sought him, but I couldn’t find him;
I called him, but he didn’t answer."
Shir-HaShirim,5,7,"The watchmen roaming the city found me;
they beat me, they wounded me;
they took away my cloak,
those guardians of the walls!"
Shir-HaShirim,5,8,"I charge you, daughters of Yerushalayim,
that if you find the man I love,
what are you to tell him?
That I am sick with love."
Shir-HaShirim,5,9,"How does the man you love differ from any other,
you most beautiful of women?
How does the man you love differ from any other,
that you should give us this charge?"
Shir-HaShirim,5,10,"The man I love is radiant and ruddy;
he stands out among ten thousand."
Shir-HaShirim,5,11,"His head is like the finest gold;
his locks are wavy and black as a raven."
Shir-HaShirim,5,12,"His eyes are like doves by running streams,
bathed in milk and set just right."
Shir-HaShirim,5,13,"His cheeks are like beds of spices,
like banks of fragrant herbs.
His lips are like lilies
dripping with sweet myrrh."
Shir-HaShirim,5,14,"His arms are rods of gold set with beryl,
his body polished ivory adorned with sapphires."
Shir-HaShirim,5,15,"His legs are like pillars of marble
set on bases of pure gold.
His appearance is like the L’vanon,
as imposing as the cedars."
Shir-HaShirim,5,16,"His words are sweetness itself;
he is altogether desirable.
This is my darling, and this is my friend,
daughters of Yerushalayim."
Shir-HaShirim,6,1,"Where has your darling gone,
you most beautiful of women?
Which way did your darling turn,
so that we can help you find him?"
Shir-HaShirim,6,2,"My darling went down to his garden,
to the beds of spices,
to pasture his flock in the gardens
and to gather lilies."
Shir-HaShirim,6,3,"I belong to the man I love, and he belongs to me;
he pastures his flock among the lilies."
Shir-HaShirim,6,4,"You are as beautiful as Tirtzah, my love,
as lovely as Yerushalayim,
but formidable as an army
marching under banners."
Shir-HaShirim,6,5,"Turn your eyes away from me,
because they overwhelm me!
Your hair is like a flock of goats
streaming down Gil‘ad."
Shir-HaShirim,6,6,"Your teeth are like a flock of sheep
that have just come up from being washed;
each of them is matched,
and none of them is missing."
Shir-HaShirim,6,7,"Your cheeks are like a pomegranate
split open behind your veil."
Shir-HaShirim,6,8,"There are sixty queens and eighty concubines,
as well as young women beyond number"
Shir-HaShirim,6,9,"but my dove, my perfect one, is unique,
her mother’s only child,
the darling of the one who bore her.
The daughters see her and call her happy;
the queens and concubines praise her."
Shir-HaShirim,6,10,"“Who is this, shining forth like the dawn,
fair as the moon, bright as the sun” —
but formidable as an army
marching under banners?"
Shir-HaShirim,6,11,"I had gone down to the nut orchard
to see the fresh green plants in the valley,
to see if the vine had budded,
or if the pomegranate trees were in bloom."
Shir-HaShirim,6,12,"Before I knew it, I found myself
in a chariot, and with me was a prince."
Shir-HaShirim,7,1,"Come back, come back, girl from Shulam!
Come back, come back to where we can see you!
Why are you looking at the girl from Shulam
as if she were dancing for two army camps?"
Shir-HaShirim,7,2,"How beautiful are your feet in sandals,
you daughter of princes!
The curves of your thighs are like a necklace
made by a skilled craftsman."
Shir-HaShirim,7,3,"Your navel is like a round goblet
that never lacks spiced wine.
Your belly is a heap of wheat
encircled by lilies."
Shir-HaShirim,7,4,"Your two breasts are like two fawns,
twins of a gazelle."
Shir-HaShirim,7,5,"Your neck is like a tower of ivory,
your eyes like the pools in Heshbon
by the gate of Bat-Rabbim,
your nose like a tower in the L’vanon
overlooking Dammesek."
Shir-HaShirim,7,6,"You hold your head like the Karmel,
and the hair on your head is like purple cloth —
the king is held captive in its tresses."
Shir-HaShirim,7,7,"How beautiful you are, my love,
how charming, how delightful!"
Shir-HaShirim,7,8,"Your appearance is stately as a palm tree,
with its fruit clusters your breasts."
Shir-HaShirim,7,9,"I said, “I will climb up into the palm tree,
I will take hold of its branches.”
May your breasts be like clusters of grapes,
your breath as fragrant as apples"
Shir-HaShirim,7,10,"and your mouth like the finest wine.
May the wine go straight to the man I love
and gently move the lips of those who are asleep."
Shir-HaShirim,7,11,"I belong to my darling,
and his desire is for me."
Shir-HaShirim,7,12,"Come, my darling, let’s go out to the country
and spend the nights in the villages."
Shir-HaShirim,7,13,"We’ll get up early and go to the vineyards
to see if the vines have budded,
to see if their flowers have opened,
or if the pomegranate trees are in bloom.
There I will give you my love."
Shir-HaShirim,7,14,"The mandrakes are sending out their fragrance,
all kinds of choice fruits are at our doors,
fruits both new and old, my darling,
which I have kept in store for you."
Shir-HaShirim,8,1,"I wish you were my brother,
who nursed at my mother’s breast;
then, if I met you outdoors, I could kiss you,
and no one would look down on me."
Shir-HaShirim,8,2,"I would lead you and bring you to my mother’s house,
and she would instruct me.
I would give you spiced wine to drink,
fresh juice from my pomegranates."
Shir-HaShirim,8,3,"His left arm would be under my head
and his right arm around me."
Shir-HaShirim,8,4,"I warn you, daughters of Yerushalayim,
not to awaken or stir up love
until it wants to arise!"
Shir-HaShirim,8,5,"Who is this, coming up from the desert,
leaning on her darling?
I awakened you under the apple tree.
It was there that your mother conceived you;
there she who bore you conceived you."
Shir-HaShirim,8,6,"Set me like a seal on your heart,
like a seal on your arm;
for love is as strong as death,
passion as cruel as Sh’ol;
its flashes are flashes of fire,
[as fierce as the] flame of Yah."
Shir-HaShirim,8,7,"No amount of water can quench love,
torrents cannot drown it.
If someone gave all the wealth in his house for love,
he would gain only utter contempt."
Shir-HaShirim,8,8,"We have a little sister;
her breasts are still unformed.
What are we to do with our sister
when she is asked for in marriage?"
Shir-HaShirim,8,9,"If she is a wall,
we will build on her a palace of silver;
and if she is a door,
we will enclose her with panels of cedar."
Shir-HaShirim,8,10,"I am a wall, and my breasts are like towers;
so in his view I am like one who brings peace."
Shir-HaShirim,8,11,"Shlomo had a vineyard at Ba‘al-Hamon,
and he gave the vineyard to caretakers;
each of them would pay for its fruit
a thousand pieces of silver."
Shir-HaShirim,8,12,"My vineyard is mine; I tend it, myself.
You can have the thousand, Shlomo,
and the fruit-caretakers, two hundred!"
Shir-HaShirim,8,13,"You who live in the garden,
friends are listening for your voice.
Let me hear it! "
Shir-HaShirim,8,14,"— Flee, my darling!
Be like a gazelle or young stag
on the mountains of spices!"
