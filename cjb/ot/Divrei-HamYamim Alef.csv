Divrei-HamYamim Alef,9,13,"and their kinsmen, leaders of their fathers’ clans, 1,760 very competent men available for serving in the house of God."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,9,14,"Of the L’vi’im: Sh’ma‘yah the son of Hashuv the son of ‘Azrikam the son of Hashavyah, from the descendants of M’rari"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,9,15,Bakbakar; Heresh; Galal; Matanyah the son of Mikha the son of Zikhri the son of Asaf
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,9,16,"‘Ovadyah the son of Sh’ma‘yah the son of Galal the son of Y’dutun; and Berekhyah the son of Asa the son of Elkanah, who lived in the towns of the N’tofati."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,9,17,"The gatekeepers: Shalum, ‘Akuv, Talmon, Achiman and their kinsmen; Shalum was the chief."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,9,18,Previously they had guarded the king’s gate to the east; they were gatekeepers for the camp of the descendants of Levi.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,9,19,"Shalum the son of Kore the son of Evyasaf the son of Korach and his kinsmen from his father’s clan the Korchim were in charge of the work of the service, keepers of the gates of the tent. Their ancestors had been in charge of the camp of ADONAI, keepers of the entryway."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,9,20,Pinchas the son of El‘azar had been ruler over them long before; ADONAI had been with him.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,9,21,Z’kharyah the son of Meshelemyah guarded the entryway to the tent of meeting.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,9,22,All these chosen to be gatekeepers numbered 212. Their genealogies were recorded in their towns; they had been appointed to their positions by David and Sh’mu’el the seer.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,9,23,"They and their descendants supervised the gates of the house of ADONAI, that is, the house of the tent, by periods of duty."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,9,24,"The gatekeepers served on the four sides, east, west, north and south."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,9,25,From time to time their kinsmen had to come in from their towns to help them for seven days.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,9,26,For the four chief gatekeepers were on permanent duty; they were the L’vi’im in charge of accommodations and supplies in the house of God.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,9,27,"They spent their nights in the vicinity of the house of God, because they were in charge of it; they were responsible for opening it up each morning."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,9,28,Some of [the L’vi’im] were in charge of the articles used for the service; they had to keep records of them when bringing them in and out.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,9,29,"Others were in charge of the equipment, the holy utensils, the fine flour, the wine, the olive oil, the frankincense and the spices."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,9,30,Some of the sons of the cohanim mixed together the ingredients for the perfumes.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,9,31,"Mattityah, one of the L’vi’im, who was the firstborn of Shalum the Korchi, was permanently in charge of baking operations."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,9,32,"Some of their kinsmen, from the descendants of the K’hati, were in charge of preparing the showbread every Shabbat."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,9,33,"Also there were the singers, heads of fathers’ clans among the L’vi’im. They lived in the accommodations and were free from other kinds of service, for they were employed in their own work day and night."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,9,34,"These were heads of fathers’ clans among the L’vi’im, according to their generations, and they were leaders; they lived in Yerushalayim."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,9,35,"In Giv‘on lived the father of Giv‘on, Ye‘i’el, whose his wife’s name was Ma‘akhah"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,9,36,"and his firstborn son ‘Avdon, Tzur, Kish, Ba‘al, Ner, Nadav"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,9,37,"G’dor, Achyo, Z’kharyah and Miklot."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,9,38,"Miklot fathered Shim’am. In contrast with some of their kinsmen, they and their families lived in Yerushalayim."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,9,39,"Ner fathered Kish; Kish fathered Sha’ul; and Sha’ul fathered Y’honatan, Malkishua, Avinadav and Eshba‘al."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,9,40,"The son of Y’honatan was M’riv-Ba‘al, and M’riv-Ba‘al fathered Mikhah."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,9,41,"The sons of Mikhah were: Piton, Melekh and Ta’rea."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,9,42,"Achaz fathered Ya‘ra; Ya‘ra fathered ‘Alemet, ‘Azmavet and Zimri; Zimri fathered Motza"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,9,43,"and Motza fathered Bin‘a. His son was Rafah, his son El‘asah and his son Atzel."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,9,44,"Atzel had six sons, whose names were: ‘Azrikam, Bokhru, Yishma‘el, Sh‘aryah, ‘Ovadyah and Hanan; all these were sons of Atzel."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,10,1,"Now the P’lishtim pressed their attack on Isra’el; and the men of Isra’el fled before the P’lishtim, leaving their dead on Mount Gilboa."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,10,2,"The P’lishtim pursued Sha’ul; overtook him and his sons; and the P’lishtim killed Y’honatan, Avinadav and Malkishua, the sons of Sha’ul."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,10,3,"The fighting went hard against Sha’ul; then the archers overtook and wounded him, so that he was in agony."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,10,4,"Sha’ul said to his armor-bearer, “Draw your sword and run me through with it. Otherwise, these uncircumcised men will come and make sport of me.” But his armor-bearer refused; he was too frightened. So Sha’ul took his sword and fell on it."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,10,5,"When his armor-bearer saw that Sha’ul was dead, he too fell on his own sword and died."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,10,6,"Thus Sha’ul, his three sons and all his household died together."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,10,7,"When all the men of Isra’el who were in the valley saw them fleeing and that Sha’ul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities and fled; then the P’lishtim came and lived in them."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,10,8,"The following day, when the P’lishtim came to strip the dead, they found Sha’ul and his sons lying dead on Mount Gilboa."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,10,9,"They stripped him, then took his head and his armor and sent them all over the territory of the P’lishtim to carry the news to their idols and to the people."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,10,10,They put his armor in the temple of their gods and fastened his skull to the temple of Dagon.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,10,11,When everyone in Yavesh-Gil‘ad heard all that the P’lishtim had done to Sha’ul
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,10,12,"all their warriors set out, took away the body of Sha’ul and the bodies of his sons, brought them to Yavesh, buried their bones under the pistachio tree in Yavesh and fasted seven days."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,10,13,"So Sha’ul died for the transgression he committed against ADONAI, because of the word of ADONAI that he did not keep and because he sought the counsel of a spirit"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,10,14,instead of consulting ADONAI. Therefore ADONAI put him to death and turned the rulership over to David the son of Yishai.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,11,1,"Then all Isra’el gathered themselves to David in Hevron and said, “Here, we are your own flesh and bone."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,11,2,"In the past, even when Sha’ul was king, it was you who led Isra’el’s military campaigns; and ADONAI your God said to you, ‘You will shepherd my people Isra’el, and you will be chief over my people Isra’el.’”"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,11,3,"So all the leaders of Isra’el came to the king in Hevron; and David made a covenant with them in Hevron in the presence of ADONAI. Then they anointed David king over Isra’el, as ADONAI had said through Sh’mu’el."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,11,4,"David and all Isra’el went to Yerushalayim, also known as Y’vus; and the Y’vusi, the inhabitants of that region, were there."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,11,5,"The inhabitants of Y’vus taunted David by saying, “You won’t get in here!” Nevertheless, David captured the stronghold of Tziyon, also known now as the City of David."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,11,6,"David said, “Whoever attacks the Y’vusi first will be commander-in-chief.” Yo’av the son of Tz’ruyah attacked first and was made commander."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,11,7,David lived in the stronghold; therefore they called it the City of David.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,11,8,"David built up the city around it, starting at the Millo [earth rampart] and going on around; while Yo’av repaired the rest of the city."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,11,9,"David grew greater and greater, because ADONAI-Tzva’ot was with him."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,11,10,"These are David’s chief warriors, who, under his rulership, joined forces with him and with all Isra’el to make him king, as ADONAI had said concerning Isra’el"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,11,11,"here is the list of David’s warrior-heroes:
Yashov‘am son of a Hakhmoni, the chief officer; he is the one who raised his spear against 300 men and killed them in a single encounter."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,11,12,"After him was El‘azar the son of Dodo the Achochi, one of the three warriors."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,11,13,"He was with David at Pas-Damim, where the P’lishtim had assembled for battle. There was a plot of ground full of barley; and when the people fled from the P’lishtim"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,11,14,"they stood in the middle of the plot and defended it, killing the P’lishtim; and ADONAI saved them with a great victory."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,11,15,Three of the thirty leaders went down to the rock and came to David during harvest season at the cave of ‘Adulam when the army of the P’lishtim had set up camp in the Refa’im Valley.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,11,16,"At that time David was in the fortress, and the garrison of the P’lishtim was in Beit-Lechem."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,11,17,"David had a craving and said, “I wish someone could give me water to drink from the well by the gate of Beit-Lechem!”"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,11,18,"The three broke through the army of the P’lishtim, drew water from the well by the gate of Beit-Lechem, took it and brought it to David. But David would not drink it; instead, he poured it out to ADONAI"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,11,19,"and said, “My God forbid that I should do such a thing! Am I to drink the blood of these men who went and put their lives in jeopardy? They risked their lives to bring it!” — and he would not consent to drink it. These are the things the three warrior-heroes did."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,11,20,Avishai the brother of Yo’av was chief of these three. He raised his spear against 300 men and killed them; thus he had a reputation even among the three.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,11,21,"Of the three in the second rank he had the most honor and was therefore made their leader; however, he did not achieve the status of the first three."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,11,22,"B’nayah the son of Y’hoyada, the son of a valiant man of Kavtze’el, was a man of many exploits. He struck down two lion-hearted men of Mo’av. One day when it was snowing, he went down into a pit and killed a lion."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,11,23,"Here is how he killed an Egyptian, a man who was very tall, seven-and-a-half feet: the Egyptian had a spear in his hand the size of a weaver’s beam; he went down to him with only a stick, seized the spear from the Egyptian’s hand and killed him with his own spear."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,11,24,These are things that B’nayah the son of Y’hoyada did that earned him a name among the three warrior-heroes.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,11,25,"He had more honor than the thirty, but he did not achieve the status of the first three. David put him in command of his personal guard."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,11,26,"There were also these warrior-heroes:
‘Asah’el the brother of Yo’av,
Elchanan the son of Dodo, from Beit-Lechem"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,11,27,"Shammah the Harori,
Heletz the P’loni"

Zavad the son of Achlai"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,11,42,"‘Adina the son of Shiza the Re’uveni, a leader among the Re’uveni,
and thirty with him"

Yoshafat the Mitni"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,11,44,"‘Uziyah the ‘Asht’rati

Yocha his brother, the Titzi"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,11,46,"Eli’el from Machavim,
Yerivai and Yoshavyah the sons of Elna‘am,
Yitmah the Mo’avi"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,11,47,"Eli’el,
‘Oved,
and Ya‘asi’el from M’tzovayah."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,1,Following are the men who joined David at Ziklag while he was still being kept away from Sha’ul the son of Kish; they were among the warriors who helped him fight his battles.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,2,They were archers who could use either hand to sling stones or shoot arrows from a bow; they were Sha’ul’s kinsmen from Binyamin.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,3,"Their leader was Achi‘ezer, then Yo’ash, the sons of Sh’ma‘ah the Giv‘ati, Y’zi’el, Pelet, the sons of ‘Azmavet, B’rakhah, Yehu from ‘Anatot"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,4,"Yishma‘yah the Giv‘oni, one of the strongest of the thirty and commander of the thirty"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,5,"Yirmeyah, Yachzi’el, Yochanan, Yozavad from G’derah"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,6,"El‘uzai, Yerimot, B‘alyah, Sh’maryah, Sh’fatyah the Harufi"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,7,"Elkanah, Yishiyahu, ‘Azar’el, Yo‘ezer, Yashov‘am the Korchi"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,8,and Yo‘elah and Z’vadyah the sons of Yerocham from G’dor.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,9,"From the Gadi a number of strong, brave, trained fighting men defected to David at the fortress in the desert. They could handle shield and spear, they were as fierce as lions, and they were as fast as deer on the hills"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,10,"‘Ezer was the leader, ‘Ovadyah was second, Eli’av third"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,11,"Mishmanah fourth, Yirmeyah fifth"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,12,"‘Atai sixth, Eli’el seventh"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,13,"Yochanan eighth, Elzavad ninth"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,14,"Yirmeyah tenth, and Makhbanai eleventh."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,15,"These descendants of Gad were army commanders; the least of them was worth a hundred, and the greatest worth a thousand."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,16,"These are the men who crossed the Yarden during the first month, when it had overflowed all its banks, and drove out all those who lived in the valleys, both to the east and to the west."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,17,From the descendants of Binyamin and Y’hudah a number came to David at the fortress.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,18,"When David went out to meet them, he said, “If you are coming to me in peace to help me, my heart will be bonded to yours. But if you are coming to betray me to my enemies, then, since I have done nothing wrong, may the God of our fathers see it and judge.”"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,19,"Then the Spirit covered ‘Amasai the chief commander, and he said:
“We are yours, David;
on your side, son of Yishai!
Peace, peace to you,
and peace to your helpers;
for your God helps you.”
David welcomed them and made them senior officers."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,20,"From M’nasheh some defected to David when he was about to go with the P’lishtim to fight against Sha’ul; but they ended up not helping them; because the rulers of the P’lishtim, after consultation, sent David away, saying, “He will defect to his master Sha’ul at the cost of our heads.”"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,21,"As he was on his way to Ziklag, those who defected to him from M’nasheh included ‘Adnach, Yozavad, Y’dia‘el, Mikha’el, Yozavad, Elihu and Tziltai, commanders of thousands from M’nasheh."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,22,"They helped David against the raiding band, for they were all strong, brave men who were commanders in the army."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,23,"Indeed, reinforcements to assist David reached him daily, until there was a great army, like the army of God."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,24,"Following are the numbers of those who came armed for war to David in Hevron, in order to transfer to him the kingdom of Sha’ul, according to what ADONAI had said."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,25,"The descendants of Y’hudah bearing shields and spears numbered 6,800, armed for war."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,26,"Of the descendants of Shim‘on, strong, brave men for war, there were 7,100."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,27,"Of the descendants of Levi, there were 4,600."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,28,"Y’hoyada was the leader of the house of Aharon, and with him were 3,700"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,29,"also Tzadok, a young man, strong and brave, with twenty-two commanders from his father’s family."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,30,"Of the descendants of Binyamin the kinsmen of Sha’ul, there were 3,000; for up until then, the majority of them had remained loyal to the house of Sha’ul."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,31,"Of the descendants of Efrayim, there were 20,800 strong, brave men, well known in their fathers’ families."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,32,"Of the half-tribe of M’nasheh, 18,000 were designated by name to come and make David king."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,33,"Of the descendants of Yissakhar, men who understood the times and knew what Isra’el ought to do, there were 200 leaders, and all their kinsmen were under their command."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,34,"Of Z’vulun, 50,000 men were fit for military service, experienced in war and able to use all kinds of weapons; they were brave, and none was doubleminded."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,35,"Of Naftali, there were 1,000 officers, and with them 37,000 troops having shields and spears."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,36,"Of Dan, 28,600 were experienced in war."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,37,"Of Asher, 40,000 men were fit for military service and experienced in war."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,38,"On the other side of the Yarden, from the Re’uveni, the Gadi and the half-tribe of M’nasheh, there were 120,000 with all kinds of weapons for battle."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,39,"All these soldiers who were experienced in war came to Hevron wholeheartedly to make David king over all Isra’el, and all the rest from Isra’el were single-hearted in wanting to make David king."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,40,"They remained there with David for three days, eating and drinking, for their kinsmen had prepared for them."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,12,41,"Moreover, those who were near them — and even those as far as Yissakhar, Z’vulun and Naftali — brought food on donkeys, camels, mules and oxen: baked goods, fig cakes, clusters of raisins, wine, oil, and oxen and sheep in abundance; for there was joy in Isra’el."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,13,1,David consulted with the commanders of thousands and of hundreds — with every leader.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,13,2,"Then David said to the entire assembly of Isra’el, “If it seems good to you, and if it is the will of ADONAI our God, let’s send messengers to the rest of our kinsmen in the land of Isra’el, and also to the cohanim and L’vi’im in their cities with surrounding open land, asking them to join us"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,13,3,"and let’s bring back the ark of our God to ourselves, since we didn’t go after it when Sha’ul was king.”"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,13,4,"The whole assembly said they would do this, for in the view of all the people it seemed right."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,13,5,"So David summoned all Isra’el to come together, from Shichor in Egypt all the way to the entrance of Hamat, to bring the ark of God from Kiryat-Ye‘arim."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,13,6,"David went up with all Isra’el to Ba‘alah, that is, Kiryat-Ye‘arim, which belonged to Y’hudah, to bring up from there the ark of God, ADONAI, who is enthroned above the k’ruvim, bearing the Name."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,13,7,"They set the ark of God on a new cart from the house of Avinadav, with ‘Uza and Achyo, the sons of Avinadav, driving the cart."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,13,8,"David and all Isra’el celebrated in the presence of God with all their strength, with songs, lyres, lutes, tambourines, cymbals and trumpets."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,13,9,"When they arrived at Kidon’s threshing-floor, the oxen stumbled; and ‘Uza put out his hand to steady the ark."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,13,10,"But ADONAI’s anger blazed up against ‘Uza, and he struck him down, because he had put out his hand and touched the ark, so that he died there before God."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,13,11,It upset David that ADONAI had broken out against ‘Uza; that place has been called Peretz-‘Uza [breaking-out of ‘Uza] ever since.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,13,12,"That day, God frightened David; he asked, “How can I bring the ark of God to me?”"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,13,13,"So David didn’t bring the ark into the City of David; rather, David carried it aside into the house of ‘Oved-’Edom the Gitti."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,13,14,The ark of God stayed with the family of ‘Oved-’Edom the Gitti in his house for three months; and ADONAI blessed the household of ‘Oved-’Edom and all he had.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,14,1,"Huram king of Tzor sent envoys to David with cedar logs, and with them stonemasons and carpenters, to build him a palace."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,14,2,"David then knew that ADONAI had set him up as king over Isra’el; because, for the sake of his people Isra’el, his royal power had been greatly increased."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,14,3,"David took more concubines and wives in Yerushalayim, and David became father of more sons and daughters."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,14,4,"Here are the names of the children born to him in Yerushalayim: Shamua, Shovav, Natan, Shlomo"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,14,5,"Yivchar, Elishua, Elpelet"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,14,6,"Nogah, Nefeg, Yafia"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,14,7,"Elishama, Be‘elyada and Elifelet."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,14,8,"When the P’lishtim heard that David had been anointed king over all Isra’el, all the P’lishtim went up in search of David. On hearing of it, David went to attack them."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,14,9,Now the P’lishtim came and made a raid in the Refa’im Valley.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,14,10,"David consulted God, asking, “Should I attack the P’lishtim? Will you hand them over to me?” ADONAI answered David, “Attack; I will hand them over to you.”"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,14,11,"So they went up to Ba‘al-P’ratzim, and David defeated them there. David said, “God has broken through my enemies by my power like a river breaking through its banks.” This is why they called the place Ba‘al-P’ratzim [Lord of breaking through]."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,14,12,"The P’lishtim had left their gods there, so David gave an order, and they were burned up completely."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,14,13,The P’lishtim came up again and raided the valley.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,14,14,"David consulted God again, but God told him, “Don’t attack them! Turn away from them, and engage them opposite the balsam trees."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,14,15,"When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, move out, and attack; because God has gone out ahead of you to defeat the army of the P’lishtim.”"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,14,16,David did as God had ordered him to do and pursued his attack on the army of the P’lishtim from Giv‘on to Gezer.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,14,17,"So David’s reputation spread to all countries, and ADONAI brought the fear of him on all nations."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,15,1,"David erected buildings for himself in the City of David, prepared a place for the ark of God, and set up a tent for it."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,15,2,"Then David said, “No one but the L’vi’im should carry the ark of God, because ADONAI chose them to carry the ark of ADONAI and to serve him forever.”"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,15,3,"David assembled all Isra’el in Yerushalayim to bring the ark of ADONAI up to its place, which he had prepared for it."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,15,4,David gathered together the descendants of Aharon and the L’vi’im
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,15,5,"from the descendants of K’hat: Uri’el the chief, and 120 of his kinsmen"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,15,6,"from the descendants of M’rari: ‘Asayah the chief, and 220 of his kinsmen"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,15,7,"from the descendants of Gershom: Yo’el the chief, and 130 of his kinsmen"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,15,8,"from the descendants of Elitzafan: Sh’ma‘yah the chief, and 200 of his kinsmen"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,15,9,"from the descendants of Hevron: Eli’el the chief, and eighty of his kinsmen"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,15,10,"and from the descendants of ‘Uzi’el: ‘Amminadav the chief, and 112 of his kinsmen."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,15,11,"David called for Tzadok and Evyatar the cohanim and for the L’vi’im — Uri’el, ‘Asayah, Yo’el, Sh’ma‘yah, Eli’el and ‘Amminadav "
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,15,12,"and said to them, “You are the clan leaders of the L’vi’im. Consecrate yourselves, both you and your kinsmen, to bring the ark of ADONAI the God of Isra’el up to the place I have prepared for it."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,15,13,It’s because you weren’t there the first time that ADONAI our God broke out against us. We didn’t seek him out according to the rule.”
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,15,14,So the cohanim and L’vi’im consecrated themselves to bring up the ark of ADONAI the God of Isra’el
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,15,15,"and the L’vi’im carried the ark of God on their shoulders with the poles on it, as Moshe had ordered, according to what ADONAI had said."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,15,16,"David spoke to the chief of the L’vi’im to appoint their kinsmen to be singers making use of musical instruments — lutes, lyres and cymbals — to play loudly and raise sounds of joy."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,15,17,"So the L’vi’im appointed Heman the son of Yo’el; of his kinsmen, Asaf the son of Berekhyahu; of the descendants of M’rari their kinsmen, Eitan the son of Kushayahu"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,15,18,"and with them their second-degree kinsmen Z’kharyahu, Ben, Ya‘azi’el, Sh’miramot, Yechi’el, ‘Uni, Eli’av, B’nayahu, Ma‘aseiyahu, Mattityahu, Elif’lehu, Mikneyahu, with ‘Oved-Edom and Ye‘i’el the gatekeepers."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,15,19,"The singers Heman, Asaf and Eitan were appointed to sound the bronze cymbals."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,15,20,"Z’kharyahu, ‘Azi’el, Sh’miramot, Yechi’el, ‘Uni, Eli’av, Ma‘aseiyahu and B’nayahu were to play the lutes for ‘alamot [high-pitched music?]."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,15,21,"Mattityahu, Elif’lehu, Mikneyahu, ’Oved-Edom, Ye‘i’el and ‘Azazyahu were to play lyres to lead the sh’minit [low-pitched music?]."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,15,22,"K’nanyahu, chief of the L’vi’im, was in charge of the singing; he was put in charge of the singing because he was skillful at it."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,15,23,Berekhyahu and Elkanah were gatekeepers for the ark.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,15,24,"Sh’vanyahu, Yoshafat, N’tan’el, ‘Amasai, Z’kharyahu, B’nayahu and Eli‘ezer the cohanim blew the trumpets in front of the ark of God. ‘Oved-Edom and Yechiyah were gatekeepers for the ark."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,15,25,"So David, the leaders of Isra’el and the commanders over thousands went to bring up the ark for the covenant of ADONAI out from the house of ‘Oved-Edom with joy."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,15,26,"Since God was helping the L’vi’im who were carrying the ark for the covenant of ADONAI, they sacrificed seven young bulls and seven rams."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,15,27,"David, all the L’vi’im bearing the ark, the singers and K’nanyah the music leader for the singers were all wearing linen cloaks; and David was also wearing a linen ritual vest."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,15,28,So all Isra’el brought up the ark for the covenant of ADONAI with shouting; blowing on shofars and trumpets; and cymbals sounding with lutes and lyres.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,15,29,"As the ark for the covenant of ADONAI entered the City of David, Mikhal the daughter of Sha’ul, watching from the window, saw King David dancing and celebrating; and she was filled with contempt for him."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,1,They brought the ark of God in and put it in the tent that David had set up for it; and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,2,"When David had finished offering the burnt offering and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of ADONAI."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,3,"Then he distributed to everyone in Isra’el, to everyone there, both men and women, a loaf of bread, a portion of meat and a raisin cake."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,4,"He appointed certain L’vi’im to serve in front of the ark of ADONAI, to celebrate, and to thank and praise ADONAI the God of Isra’el"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,5,"Asaf, the leader; assisting him, Z’kharyah; then Ye‘i’el, Sh’miramot, Yechi’el, Mattityahu, Eli’av, B’nayahu, ‘Oved-Edom and Ye‘i’el playing lutes and lyres, while Asaf played cymbals."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,6,B’nayah and Yachzi’el the cohanim blew the trumpets continually before the ark for the covenant of God.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,7,It was on that same day that David first ordered that thanks be given to ADONAI through Asaf and his kinsmen
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,8,"Give thanks to ADONAI! Call on his name!
Make his deeds known among the peoples."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,9,"Sing to him, sing praises to him!
Talk about all his wonders."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,10,"Glory in his holy name;
let those seeking ADONAI have joyful hearts."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,11,"Seek ADONAI and his strength;
always seek his presence."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,12,"Remember the wonders he has done,
his signs and his spoken judgments."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,13,"You descendants of Isra’el his servant,
you offspring of Ya‘akov, his chosen ones"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,14,"he is ADONAI our God,
His judgments are everywhere on earth."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,15,"Remember his covenant forever,
the word he commanded to a thousand generations"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,16,"the covenant he made with Avraham;
the oath he swore to Yitz’chak"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,17,"and established as a law for Ya‘akov,
for Isra’el as an everlasting covenant"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,18,"“To you I will give the land of Kena‘an
as your allotted heritage.”"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,19,"When you were but few in number,
and not only few, but aliens there too"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,20,"wandering from nation to nation,
from this kingdom to that people"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,21,"he allowed no one to oppress them.
Yes, for their sakes he rebuked even kings"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,22,"“Don’t touch my anointed ones
or do my prophets harm!”"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,23,"Sing to ADONAI, all the earth!
Proclaim his victory day after day!"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,24,"Declare his glory among the nations,
his wonders among all peoples!"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,25,"For ADONAI is great, and greatly to be praised;
he is to be feared more than all gods."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,26,"For all the gods of the peoples are nothing,
but ADONAI made the heavens."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,27,"In his presence are honor and majesty;
in his place, strength and joy."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,28,"Give ADONAI his due, you families from the peoples,
give ADONAI his due of glory and strength"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,29,"give ADONAI the glory due to his name;
bring an offering, and come into his presence.
Worship ADONAI in splendid, holy attire."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,30,"Tremble before him, all the earth!
The world is firmly established, immovable."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,31,"Let the heavens rejoice; let the earth be glad;
let them say among the nations, “ADONAI is king!”"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,32,"Let the sea roar, and everything in it;
let the fields exult, and all that is in them."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,33,"Then the trees in the forest will sing before ADONAI,
because he has come to judge the earth."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,34,"Give thanks to ADONAI; for he is good,
for his grace continues forever."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,35,"Say: “Save us, God who can save us!
Gather and rescue us from the nations;
so that we can thank your holy name
and glory in praising you."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,36,"Blessed be ADONAI, the God of Isra’el,
from eternity past to eternity future!”
All the people said, “Amen!” and praised ADONAI."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,37,"So, there before the ark for the covenant of ADONAI, David left Asaf and his kinsmen to perform the service regularly before the ark, as each day’s work required"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,38,"also ‘Oved-Edom with their kinsmen, sixty-eight of them — ‘Oved-Edom the son of Y’dutun and Hosah were gatekeepers."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,39,He left Tzadok the cohen with his kinsmen before the tabernacle of ADONAI at the high place in Giv‘on
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,40,"to offer burnt offerings to ADONAI every morning and evening on the altar for burnt offerings, according to everything written in the Torah of ADONAI, which he gave to Isra’el."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,41,"With them were Heman and Y’dutun and the rest who were chosen and assigned by name to give thanks to ADONAI, because his grace continues forever."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,42,"With them were Heman and Y’dutun to play trumpets and cymbals, also instruments for the songs about God; while the sons of Y’dutun were assigned to the gate."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,16,43,"Then the people all left for their homes, and David returned to bless his household."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,17,1,"After David had been living in his palace awhile, he said to Natan the prophet, “Here, I’m living in a cedar-wood palace; but the ark for the covenant of ADONAI is kept under a tent!”"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,17,2,"Natan said to David, “Go, do everything that is in your heart, for God is with you.”"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,17,3,But that same night the word of God came to Natan
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,17,4,"“Go, and tell David my servant that this is what ADONAI says: ‘You are not to build me a house to live in"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,17,5,"because from the day I brought up Isra’el until today, I never lived in a house; rather, I’ve gone from tent to tent and from one tabernacle to another."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,17,6,"Everywhere I traveled with all Isra’el, did I ever speak a word to any of the judges of Isra’el, whom I ordered to shepherd my people Isra’el, asking, “Why haven’t you built me a cedar-wood house?”’"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,17,7,"“Therefore say to my servant David that this is what ADONAI-Tzva’ot says: ‘I took you from the sheep-yards, from following the sheep, to make you chief over my people Isra’el."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,17,8,"I have been with you wherever you went, I have destroyed all your enemies ahead of you; and I am making your reputation like the reputations of the greatest people on earth."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,17,9,"I will assign a place to my people Isra’el; I will plant them there, so that they can live in their own place without being disturbed any more. The wicked will no longer devastate them, as they did at the beginning"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,17,10,"and as they did from the time I ordered judges to be over my people Isra’el; instead, I will subdue all your enemies.
“‘Moreover, I tell you that ADONAI will make you a house."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,17,11,"When your days come to an end and you go to be with your ancestors, I will establish one of your descendants to succeed you, one of your own sons; and I will set up his rulership."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,17,12,"He will build me a house, and I will establish his throne forever."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,17,13,"I will be a father for him, and he will be a son for me; I will not take my grace away from him, as I took it away from your predecessor."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,17,14,"Rather, I will maintain him in my house and in my kingdom forever; and his throne will be set up forever.’”"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,17,15,Natan told David all of these words and described this entire vision.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,17,16,"Then David went in, sat before ADONAI and said, “Who am I, ADONAI, God, and what is my family, that has caused you to bring me this far?"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,17,17,"Yet in your view, God, even this was but a small thing; so you have said that your servant’s dynasty will continue on into the distant future. You have regarded me, ADONAI, God, as a man of high rank."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,17,18,What more can David say to you about the honor you are bestowing on your servant? For you know your servant intimately.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,17,19,"ADONAI, it is for your servant’s sake and in accordance with your own heart that you have done all this greatness and revealed all these great things."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,17,20,"ADONAI, there is no one like you, and there is no God besides you — everything we have heard confirms that."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,17,21,"Who can be compared with your people Isra’el? What other nation on earth did God set out to redeem and turn into a people for himself? You made yourself a reputation by doing great and terrifying things, as you drove out the nations from before your people, whom you redeemed from Egypt."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,17,22,"For you made your people Isra’el your people forever; and you, ADONAI, became their God."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,17,23,"So now, ADONAI, let the word that you spoke concerning your servant and his house be confirmed forever; do what you have promised."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,17,24,"May your name be confirmed and magnified forever; so that it will be said, ‘ADONAI-Tzva’ot is the God of Isra’el and the God for Isra’el, and the dynasty of David your servant will be set up in your presence.’"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,17,25,"For you, my God, have disclosed to your servant that you will build him a house. This is why your servant has the courage to pray to you."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,17,26,"Now, ADONAI, you are God; and you have made this wonderful promise to your servant"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,17,27,"and now it has pleased you to bless the family of your servant and thereby cause it to continue forever in your presence. For you, ADONAI, have blessed, and it is blessed forever.”"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,18,1,"Some time afterwards, David attacked the P’lishtim and subdued them; David took Gat and its villages out of the hands of the P’lishtim."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,18,2,"He also defeated Mo’av, so that the people of Mo’av became subjects of David and paid tribute."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,18,3,"David, on his way to establish his dominion as far as the Euphrates River, also defeated Hadar‘ezer king of Tzovah near Hamat."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,18,4,"David captured 1,000 chariots, 7,000 horsemen and 20,000 foot soldiers. He reserved enough horses for 100 chariots and disabled the rest."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,18,5,"When the people of Aram from Dammesek came to the aid of Hadar‘ezer king of Tzovah, David killed 22,000 men of Aram."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,18,6,Then David put [garrisons] among the people of Aram in Dammesek; Aram became subject to David and paid tribute. ADONAI gave victory to David wherever he went.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,18,7,David took the gold shields which Hadar‘ezer’s servants were wearing and brought them to Yerushalayim.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,18,8,"From Tivchat and Kun, cities of Hadar‘ezer, King David took a great quantity of bronze, which Shlomo used to make the bronze “Sea,” the columns and various bronze articles."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,18,9,When To‘u king of Hamat heard that David had defeated the entire army of Hadar‘ezer king of Tzovah
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,18,10,"he sent Hadoram his son to King David to greet and congratulate him on fighting and defeating Hadar‘ezer — for Hadar‘ezer had been at war with To‘u — and [he sent] all kinds of articles made of silver, gold and bronze"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,18,11,"which King David dedicated to ADONAI, along with the silver and gold that he had carried off from all the nations — from Edom, Mo’av, the people of ‘Amon, the P’lishtim and ‘Amalek."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,18,12,"Moreover, Avishai the son of Tz’ruyah killed 18,000 men from Edom in the Salt Valley."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,18,13,"David stationed garrisons in Edom, and all the people of Edom became subject to him. ADONAI gave victory to David wherever he went."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,18,14,David ruled over all Isra’el; he administered law and justice for all his people.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,18,15,"Yo’av the son of Tz’ruyah was commander of the army, Y’hoshafat the son of Achilud was chief adviser"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,18,16,"Tzadok the son of Achituv and Avimelekh the son of Evyatar were cohanim, Shavsha was secretary"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,18,17,"B’nayahu the son of Y’hoyada was in charge of the K’reti and P’leti [serving as the king’s bodyguards], and David’s sons were the king’s chief personal advisers."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,19,1,"Some time later, when Nachash the king of the people of ‘Amon died, his son became king in his place."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,19,2,"David said, “I will be kind to Hanun the son of Nachash, because his father showed grace to me.” So David sent messengers to comfort him about his father.
David’s servants entered the territory of the people of ‘Amon to go to Hanun and comfort him"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,19,3,"but the leaders of the people of ‘Amon said to Hanun, “Do you really think David is honoring your father by sending people to comfort you? Haven’t his servants come to you in order to look the city over, overthrow it and reconnoiter the land?”"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,19,4,"So Hanun took David’s servants, shaved them, cut off their clothes halfway up, at their hips, and then sent them away."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,19,5,"Some people reported to David how the men had been treated. He sent a delegation to meet them, because the men had been deeply humiliated. The king said, “Stay in Yericho until your beards have grown back, and then return.”"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,19,6,"Aware that they had made themselves utterly abhorrent to David, Hanun and the people of ‘Amon sent thirty-three tons of silver to hire chariots and horsemen from Aram-Naharayim, Aram-Ma‘akhah and Tzovah."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,19,7,"They hired 32,000 chariots, as well as the king of Ma‘akhah with his people, who came and pitched their camp in front of Meidva. Then the people of ‘Amon assembled themselves from their cities and went out to fight."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,19,8,"When David heard of it, he sent Yo’av with his entire army of trained soldiers."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,19,9,"The army of ‘Amon came out and went into battle formation at the city gate, while the kings who had come were alone in the countryside."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,19,10,"When Yo’av saw that he would be fighting on two fronts, ahead and behind, he chose the best troops of Isra’el to deploy against Aram"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,19,11,while the rest of the army he put under the command of Avishai his brother to deploy against the army of ‘Amon.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,19,12,"He said, “If Aram is too strong for me, you help me; but if the army of ‘Amon is too strong for you, then I will help you."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,19,13,"Take courage, and let’s be strong for the sake of our people and the cities of our God. May ADONAI do what seems good to him.”"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,19,14,"So Yo’av and the people with him went to engage Aram in battle, and they fled before him."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,19,15,"When the people of ‘Amon saw that Aram had fled, they likewise fled before Avishai his brother and retreated into the city. Then Yo’av went to Yerushalayim."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,19,16,"When Aram saw that Isra’el had gotten the better of them, they sent messengers and brought out the people of Aram who lived beyond the [Euphrates] River, with Shofakh the commander of Hadar‘ezer’s army at their head."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,19,17,"It was reported to David; so he gathered all Isra’el together and crossed the Yarden to engage them. David deployed his forces for battle against Aram; and after he had done so, fought them."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,19,18,"But Aram fled before Isra’el; David killed 7,000 chariot-drivers and 40,000 foot soldiers from Aram; and he killed Shofakh the commander of the army."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,19,19,"When all Hadar‘ezer’s servants saw that they had been defeated by Isra’el, they made peace with David and became his subjects; and Aram would no longer help the people of ‘Amon."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,20,1,"In the spring, at the time when kings go out to war, Yo’av led the army out in force and laid waste to the country of the people of ‘Amon; then he came and laid siege to Rabbah. But David stayed in Yerushalayim, while Yo’av attacked Rabbah and destroyed it."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,20,2,"David took the crown off Malkam’s head and found it to weigh sixty-six pounds, with its gold and precious stones; and it was placed on David’s head. He carried off great quantities of spoil from the city."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,20,3,"In addition, he brought out the people who were in it and set them to work with saws, iron harrows and axes. This is what he did to all the cities of the people of ‘Amon. Then David and all the people returned to Yerushalayim."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,20,4,"A while after this there was war at Gezer with the P’lishtim. Sibkhai the Hushati killed Sipai, one of the giants, and they were defeated."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,20,5,"There was more war with the P’lishtim; and Elchanan the son of Ya’ir killed Lachmi the brother of Golyat the Gitti, who had a spear with a shaft like a weaver’s beam."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,20,6,"There was again war at Gat, where there was a very tall man whose fingers and toes numbered twenty-four, six [fingers on each hand] and six [toes on each foot]; and he too was a son of the giant."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,20,7,"When he mocked Isra’el, Y’honatan the son of Shim‘a David’s brother killed him."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,20,8,These were sons of the giant in Gat; they fell at the hands of David and his servants.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,21,1,The Adversary now rose up against Isra’el and incited David to take a census of Isra’el.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,21,2,"David said to Yo’av and the leaders of the people, “Go, take a census of Isra’el from Be’er-Sheva to Dan; then report to me, so that I can know how many of them there are.”"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,21,3,"Yo’av said, “May ADONAI make his people a hundred times as many as they are now! But, my lord the king, aren’t they all my lord’s servants in any case? Why does my lord the king require this? Why should he bring guilt upon Isra’el?”"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,21,4,"Nevertheless, the king’s word prevailed against Yo’av. So Yo’av left and went through all Isra’el, after which he came to Yerushalayim."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,21,5,"Yo’av reported the results of the census to David: in Isra’el were 1,100,000 men who could handle a sword, while Y’hudah had 470,000 men who could handle a sword."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,21,6,"But he didn’t count Levi and Binyamin among them, because the king’s order was hateful to Yo’av."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,21,7,God was displeased with this and therefore punished Isra’el.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,21,8,"David said to God, “I have greatly sinned by doing this. But now, please! Put aside your servant’s sin, for I have done a very foolish thing.”"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,21,9,"ADONAI spoke to Gad, David’s seer"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,21,10,"“Go and tell David that ADONAI says, ‘I am offering you a choice of three punishments: choose one of them, and I will execute it against you.’”"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,21,11,"Gad came to David and said to him, “Take your choice"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,21,12,"three years of famine; or three months of being swept away by your enemies, while your enemies’ sword overwhelms you; or three days of ADONAI’s sword — plague in the land, with the angel of ADONAI destroying everywhere in Isra’el’s territory. Now think about what answer I should give to the one who sent me.”"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,21,13,"David said to Gad, “This is very hard for me. Let me fall into the hand of ADONAI, because his mercies are very great, rather than have me fall into the hand of man.”"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,21,14,"So ADONAI sent a plague on Isra’el; 70,000 of the people of Isra’el died."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,21,15,"God also sent an angel to destroy Yerushalayim, but when he was about to carry out the destruction, ADONAI saw it and changed his mind about causing such distress; so he said to the destroying angel, “Enough! Now withdraw your hand.” The angel of ADONAI was standing at the threshing-floor of Ornan the Y’vusi."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,21,16,"David raised his eyes and saw the angel of ADONAI standing between the earth and the sky, and in his hand was a drawn sword stretched out over Yerushalayim. Then David and the leaders, wearing sackcloth, fell on their faces."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,21,17,"David said to God, “Wasn’t it I who ordered the census of the people? Yes, I am the one who has sinned and done something very wicked. But these sheep, what have they done? Please! Let your hand be against me and my father’s family, but not against your people, striking them with this plague!”"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,21,18,Then the angel of ADONAI ordered Gad to tell David to go and set up an altar to ADONAI on the threshing-floor of Ornan the Y’vusi.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,21,19,"David went up at Gad’s word, spoken in ADONAI’s name."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,21,20,"Ornan turned back and saw the angel, and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. As Ornan was threshing wheat"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,21,21,"David approached Ornan. When Ornan looked and saw David, he went out from the threshing-floor and prostrated himself before David with his face to the ground."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,21,22,"Then David said to Ornan, “Let me have the parcel with this threshing-floor, so that I can build on it an altar to ADONAI — I will pay you its full value — so that the plague will be lifted from the people.”"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,21,23,"Ornan said to David, “Take it for yourself, and let my lord the king do what seems good to him. I’m giving you the oxen for the burnt offerings, the threshing-sledges for firewood and the wheat for the grain offering — I’m giving it all.”"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,21,24,"But King David said to Ornan, “No; I insist on buying it from you at the full price. I refuse to take what is yours for ADONAI or offer a burnt offering that costs me nothing.”"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,21,25,So David bought the place from Ornan for 600 shekels of gold by weight [fifteen pounds].
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,21,26,"Then David built an altar to ADONAI there and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. He called on ADONAI, who answered him from heaven by fire on the altar for burnt offerings."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,21,27,"ADONAI gave an order to the angel, and he put his sword back in its sheath."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,21,28,"When David saw that ADONAI had answered him at the threshing-floor of Ornan the Y’vusi, he sacrificed there."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,21,29,"For at that time the tabernacle of ADONAI, which Moshe had made in the desert, together with the altar for burnt offerings, were in the high place at Giv‘on."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,21,30,"But David could not go into its presence to consult God, because the sword of the angel of ADONAI had struck him with terror."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,22,1,"Then David said, “This is the house of ADONAI, God; and this is the altar Isra’el is to use for burnt offerings.”"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,22,2,"David ordered that the foreigners in the land of Isra’el should be assembled, and he appointed stone-workers to shape stones for building the house of God."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,22,3,"David prepared a large store of iron from which to make nails and clamps for the gateway doors and, a quantity of bronze too great to weigh"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,22,4,and cedar logs beyond numbering — because the Tzidonim and the people from Tzor brought cedar logs in abundance to David.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,22,5,"David said, “Shlomo my son is young and inexperienced, while the house to be built for ADONAI must be so magnificent and splendid that its fame and glory will be known in every country; so I will make preparations for him.” Therefore David made extensive preparations before his death."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,22,6,"Then he summoned Shlomo his son and charged him to build a house for ADONAI, the God of Isra’el."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,22,7,"“My son,” said David to Shlomo, “my heart was set on building a house for the name of ADONAI my God."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,22,8,"But a message from ADONAI came to me, ‘You have shed much blood and fought great wars. You are not to build a house for my name, because you have shed so much blood on the earth in my sight."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,22,9,"But you will have a son who will be a man of rest. I will give him rest from all his enemies that surround him; for his name is to be Shlomo, and during his reign I will give peace and quiet to Isra’el."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,22,10,"It is he who will build a house for my name. He will be my son and I will be his father, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Isra’el forever.’"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,22,11,"“Now, my son, may ADONAI be with you and give you success as you build the house of ADONAI your God, in keeping with what he said about you."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,22,12,"May ADONAI give you common sense and understanding, and may he give you his orders concerning Isra’el, so that you will observe the Torah of ADONAI your God."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,22,13,"Then you will succeed, if you take care to obey the laws and rulings that ADONAI ordered Moshe concerning Isra’el. Be strong, be bold; don’t be afraid or become discouraged!"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,22,14,"“Now look: despite my difficulties, I have prepared for the house of ADONAI 3,300 tons of gold, 33,000 tons of silver, and so much bronze and iron that it can’t be weighed. I’ve also prepared timber and stone, and you can add to it."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,22,15,"Moreover, you have plenty of workers — quarrymen, stone-workers, lumbermen, and all kinds of skilled craftsmen to do whatever has to be done with"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,22,16,"the gold, silver, bronze and iron — they’re beyond number. So get up, and get to work! And may ADONAI be with you.”"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,22,17,David also ordered all the leaders of Isra’el to help Shlomo his son
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,22,18,“Isn’t ADONAI your God with you? Hasn’t he given you rest on every side? For he has put the inhabitants of the land under my power — the land has been subdued before ADONAI and his people.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,22,19,"Now set your heart and being on seeking ADONAI your God. Get up, and build the sanctuary for ADONAI, God. Then you can bring the ark for the covenant of ADONAI and the holy articles of God into the house that will be built for the name of ADONAI.”"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,23,1,David had now grown old; he had lived many years; so he made Shlomo his son king over Isra’el.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,23,2,"Then he assembled all the leaders of Isra’el, with the cohanim and L’vi’im."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,23,3,"A census of L’vi’im thirty years old and over was taken, and their number came to 38,000."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,23,4,"Of these, 24,000 were to oversee the work on the house of ADONAI, while 6,000 were officials and judges"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,23,5,"4,000 were gatekeepers, and 4,000 sang praise to ADONAI “with the instruments I made for the purpose of singing praise.”"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,23,6,"David organized them into divisions named after the sons of Levi — Gershon, K’hat and M’rari."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,23,7,For the Gershuni: La‘dan and Shim‘i.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,23,8,"The sons of La‘dan: Yechi’el the chief, Zetam and Yo’el — three."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,23,9,"The sons of Shim‘i: Shlomit, Hazi’el and Haran — three. These were the heads of the clans of La‘dan."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,23,10,"The sons of Shim‘i: Yachat, Zina Ye‘ush and B’ri‘ah. These four were the sons of Shim‘i."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,23,11,"Yachat was the chief and Zizah the second, then Ye‘ush and B’ri‘ah, who did not have many descendants and were therefore counted as one clan."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,23,12,"The sons of K’hat: ‘Amram, Yitz’har, Hevron and ‘Uzi’el — four."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,23,13,"The sons of ‘Amram: Aharon and Moshe. Aharon was set apart to be consecrated as especially holy, he and his sons forever; so that they might bring offerings before ADONAI, perform the service for him and bless in his name forever."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,23,14,"But as for Moshe the man of God, his sons are included with the tribe of Levi."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,23,15,The sons of Moshe: Gershom and Eli‘ezer.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,23,16,The sons of Gershom: Sh’vu’el the chief.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,23,17,"The sons of Eli‘ezer were: Rechavyah the chief. Eli‘ezer had no other sons, but the sons of Rechavyah were very numerous."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,23,18,The sons of Yitz’har: Shlomit the chief.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,23,19,"The sons of Hevron: Yeriyahu the chief, Amaryah the second, Yachzi’el the third and Y’kam‘am the fourth."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,23,20,The sons of ‘Uzi’el: Mikhah the chief and Yishiyah the second.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,23,21,The sons of M’rari: Machli and Mushi. The sons of Machli: El‘azar and Kish.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,23,22,"El‘azar died without having sons, but daughters only; their cousins, the sons of Kish, married them."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,23,23,"Mushi had three sons — Machli, ‘Eder and Yeremot."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,23,24,"These were the descendants of Levi, according to their clans, the heads of clans according to their listing in the register, who did the work for the service of the house of ADONAI, those twenty years old and over."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,23,25,"For David said, “ADONAI the God of Isra’el has given rest to his people, and he lives in Yerushalayim forever."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,23,26,The L’vi’im will no longer have to carry the tabernacle and all the equipment that goes with it for its service.”
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,23,27,"For, according to David’s last instructions, the descendants of Levi twenty years old and over were to be counted."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,23,28,"Their role was to assist the descendants of Aharon with the service of the house of ADONAI in the courtyards and rooms, and with purification of all the holy articles — in other words, with the work needed to minister in the house of God."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,23,29,"They were to assist with the showbread and the finely ground flour needed for grain offerings, no matter whether of matzah, pan-baked bread or mixed with oil, and no matter what shape or size."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,23,30,"They were to stand every morning to sing thanks and praises to ADONAI, and likewise every evening."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,23,31,"They were to be present regularly before ADONAI whenever burnt offerings were offered to ADONAI on Shabbat, at Rosh-Hodesh, and at the other designated times, in the numbers required by the rules for sacrifices."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,23,32,"Finally, for the service in the house of ADONAI they were to perform their duties in relation to the tent of meeting, the Holy Place and their kinsmen the descendants of Aharon."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,24,1,"The divisions of the descendants of Aharon were as follows:
The sons of Aharon: Nadav, Avihu, El‘azar and Itamar."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,24,2,But Nadav and Avihu died before their father and had no children; therefore El‘azar and Itamar functioned as the cohanim.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,24,3,"David, together with Tzadok from the descendants of El‘azar, and Achimelekh from the descendants of Itamar, arranged them in divisions for service."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,24,4,"There were more men who were chiefs found among the descendants of El‘azar than among the descendants of Itamar; therefore there were sixteen divisions of the descendants of El‘azar, headed by clan leaders, and eight divisions of the descendants of Itamar, according to their clans."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,24,5,"They were assigned [periods of service] by lot, the one group equally with the other, since both the descendants of El‘azar and the descendants of Itamar had officers of the sanctuary and officers of God."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,24,6,"Sh’ma‘yah the son of N’tan’el the secretary, one of the L’vi’im, recorded them in the presence of the king, the officers, Tzadok the cohen, Achimelekh the son of Evyatar, and the clan leaders of the cohanim and of the L’vi’im — with two clan divisions taken from El‘azar for each one from Itamar."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,24,7,"The first lot drawn was for Y’hoyariv,
the second for Y’da‘yah"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,24,8,"the third for Harim,
the fourth for S‘orim"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,24,9,"the fifth for Malkiyah,
the sixth for Miyamin"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,24,10,"the seventh for Hakotz,
the eighth for Aviyah"

the tenth for Sh’khanyahu"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,24,12,"the eleventh for Elyashiv,
the twelfth for Yakim"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,24,13,"the thirteenth for Hupah,
the fourteenth for Yeshev’av"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,24,14,"the fifteenth for Bilgah,
the sixteenth for Immer"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,24,15,"the seventeenth for Hezir,
the eighteenth for HaPitzetz"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,24,16,"the nineteenth for P’tachyah,
the twentieth for Yechezk’el"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,24,17,"the twenty-first for Yakhin,
the twenty-second for Gamul"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,24,18,"the twenty-third for D’layahu, and
the twenty-fourth for Ma‘azyahu."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,24,19,"These are the divisions and the sequence in which they served in the house of ADONAI, in accordance with the rule they were given through Aharon their ancestor, as ADONAI the God of Isra’el had ordered him."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,24,20,"The rest of the descendants of Levi: of the descendants of ‘Amram, Shuva’el; of the descendants of Shuva’el, Yechd’yah."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,24,21,"Of Rechavyahu: of the descendants of Rechavyahu, Yishiyah the chief."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,24,22,"Of the Yitz’hari, Shlomot; of the descendants of Shlomot, Yachat."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,24,23,"Of the sons [of Hevron]: Yeriyahu, Amaryahu second, Yachzi’el third and Y’kam‘am fourth."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,24,24,"The descendants of ‘Uzi’el: Mikhah; of the descendants of Mikhah, Shamir."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,24,25,"The brother of Mikhah: Yishiyah; of the descendants of Yishiyah, Z’kharyahu."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,24,26,The sons of M’rari: Machli and Mushi. The descendants of his son Ya‘aziyahu
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,24,27,"that is, the descendants of M’rari through his descendant Ya‘aziyahu: Shoham, Zakur and ‘Ivri."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,24,28,"Of Machli: El‘azar, who had no sons."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,24,29,"Of Kish: the descendants of Kish, Yerachme’el."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,24,30,"And the sons of Mushi: Machli, ‘Eder and Yerimot.
These were the descendants of the L’vi’im according to their clans."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,24,31,"These likewise cast lots, as had their kinsmen the descendants of Aharon, in the presence of David the king, Tzadok, Achimelekh, and the clan leaders of the cohanim and of the L’vi’im; with the senior and junior clans casting lots equally."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,25,1,"For the service, David and the army commanders selected some of the descendants of Asaf, of Heman and of Y’dutun to prophesy with lyres, lutes and cymbals. The list of those doing this work, according to the type of work performed was"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,25,2,"Of the descendants of Asaf: Zakur, Yosef, N’tanyah and Asar’elah; the sons of Asaf were with Asaf, who prophesied according to the direction of the king."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,25,3,"Of Y’dutun, the descendants of Y’dutun: G’dalyahu, Tzeri, Yesha‘yahu, Hashavyahu, Mattityahu — six, with their father Y’dutun, who, accompanied by the lyre, prophesied thanks and praise to ADONAI."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,25,4,"Of Heman, the sons of Heman: Bukiyahu, Mattanyahu, ‘Uzi’el, Sh’vu’el, Yerimot, Hananyah, Hanani, Eli’atah, Gidalti, Romamti-‘ezer, Yoshb’kashah, Maloti, Hotir and Machzi’ot"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,25,5,"all these sons of Heman, the king’s seer in matters pertaining to God, were there to exalt [God]. God gave Heman fourteen sons and three daughters."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,25,6,"They were all with their fathers Asaf, Y’dutun and Heman to sing with cymbals, lutes and lyres in the house of ADONAI, serving in the house of God under the direction of the king."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,25,7,"Their number, together with their kinsmen who had been instructed in singing to ADONAI, was 288, all well trained."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,25,8,"Whether great or small, teacher or talmid, they cast lots for their term of duty."

These were the commanders of the tribes of Isra’el."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,27,23,"But David did not include in the registration those twenty years old or less, because ADONAI had said he would increase Isra’el’s numbers like the stars in the sky."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,27,24,"Yo’av the son of Tz’ruyah began a census of these, but he did not finish, and wrath came upon Isra’el because of this; moreover the number was not entered into the Annals of King David."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,27,25,"In charge of the king’s supplies was ‘Azmavet the son of ‘Adi’el. In charge of the supplies in the countryside, the cities, the villages and the fortresses was Y’honatan the son of ‘Uziyahu."

Divrei-HamYamim Alef,27,30,"Ovil the Yishma‘eli was put over the camels, Yechd’yahu the Meronoti over the donkeys"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,27,31,and Yaziz the Hagri over the flocks [of sheep and goats]. All of these were responsible for King David’s property.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,27,32,"Y’honatan David’s uncle was an adviser, a man of understanding and a secretary. Yechi’el the son of Hachmoni took care of the king’s sons."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,27,33,Achitofel was an adviser to the king. Hushai the Archi was the king’s confidant
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,27,34,and after Achitofel were Y’hoyada the son of B’nayah and Evyatar. Yo’av was commander of the king’s army.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,28,1,"David assembled in Yerushalayim all the leaders of Isra’el — the leaders of the tribes, the commanders of the divisions serving the king, the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and the supervisors over the property and livestock of the king, along with his sons, the officials, the warrior-heroes, and anyone else who was a leader."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,28,2,"Then David the king rose to his feet and said: “My kinsmen and my people! Listen to me! I set my heart on building a house where the ark for the covenant of ADONAI could remain at rest. It would have been God’s footstool, and I prepared to build it."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,28,3,"But God said to me, ‘You are not to build a house for my name, because you are a man of war, you have shed blood.’"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,28,4,"However, ADONAI the God of Isra’el chose me out of my father’s whole family to be king over Isra’el forever; for he chose Y’hudah to be the leader; and in the house of Y’hudah, in the house of my father, and among the sons of my father, it was his pleasure to make me king over all Isra’el"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,28,5,and of all my sons — for ADONAI has given me many sons — he has chosen Shlomo my son to sit on the throne of the kingdom of ADONAI over Isra’el.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,28,6,"“Moreover, he said to me, ‘Shlomo your son will build my house and courtyards, for I have chosen him to be a son to me, and I will be a father to him."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,28,7,"I will establish his kingdom forever, if he uses his strength to obey my mitzvot and abide by my rulings, as [he is doing] currently.’"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,28,8,"Now therefore, in the sight of all Isra’el, the community of ADONAI, and in the hearing of our God, observe and seek out all the mitzvot of ADONAI your God, so that you may continue to possess this good land and leave it as an inheritance to your descendants after you forever."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,28,9,"“As for you, Shlomo my son, know the God of your father. Serve him wholeheartedly and with desire in your being; for ADONAI searches all hearts and understands all the inclinations of people’s thoughts. If you seek him, he will let himself be found by you; but if you abandon him, he will reject you forever."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,28,10,"See now that ADONAI has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary; so be strong, and do it!”"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,28,11,"Then David gave Shlomo his son the designs for the hall [of the temple], its buildings, its supply areas, its upper rooms, its inside rooms, and the place for the ark-cover"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,28,12,"also the designs for everything he had been given by the Spirit — for the courtyards of the house of ADONAI, for all the rooms surrounding it, for the storehouses in the house of God, for the storehouses for the holy articles"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,28,13,and for the areas set aside for the cohanim and the L’vi’im; [arrangements] for the work involved in the service of the house of ADONAI and for all the articles needed for the service of the house of ADONAI
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,28,14,"[lists] of the weights of gold needed for the gold items to be used for various purposes, and the weights of silver needed for the silver items to be used for various purposes "
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,28,15,"the weight of the gold needed for the gold menorahs, the weight needed for each menorah and for its lamps; and for the menorahs of silver, the weight of silver needed for each menorah and for its lamps, according to the way each menorah was to be used"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,28,16,"also the gold by weight for the tables for the showbread, for each table; and silver for the tables made of silver"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,28,17,"the gold for the pure gold forks, basins and jars, and for the gold bowls by weight for each bowl; also for the silver bowls by weight for each bowl"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,28,18,"and for the incense altar, refined gold by weight; and gold for the design of the chariot and the k’ruvim with their wings spread out to cover the ark for the covenant of ADONAI."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,28,19,"“All this is in writing, as ADONAI, with his hand on me, has given me good sense in working out these detailed plans.”"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,28,20,"Then David said to Shlomo his son, “Be strong, be bold, and do it! Don’t be afraid or become discouraged! For ADONAI, God, my God, is with you. He will not fail you or abandon you until all the work for the service in the house of ADONAI has been finished."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,28,21,"See, there are the divisions of the cohanim and L’vi’im for all the service in the house of God. For every kind of work, you will have with you every man who is willing and skilled, for every kind of service. Also the captains and all the people will be completely at your disposal.”"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,29,1,"To the whole community, David the king said, “Shlomo my son is the only one God has chosen. But he is still young and inexperienced, whereas the work to be done is great; because the palace is not for anyone human, but for ADONAI, God."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,29,2,"Now I have used all my strength to prepare for the house of my God the gold needed for the articles of gold, the silver for the articles of silver, the bronze for the articles of bronze, the iron for the articles of iron, the wood for the articles of wood, onyx stones, gemstones to be set, brilliant stones of various colors, all kinds of precious stones, as well as marble in abundance."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,29,3,"In addition, because my desire is set on the house of my God, since I have my own supply of gold and silver, I herewith give it to the house of my God — over and above everything I have prepared for the holy house "
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,29,4,ninety-nine tons of gold from the gold of Ofir and 231 tons of refined silver to be used for overlaying the walls of the houses.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,29,5,"The gold is for whatever is to be made of gold, and the silver is for whatever is to be made of silver; and they may be used for anything to be made by craftsmen. Therefore, who offers willingly to consecrate himself today to ADONAI?”"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,29,6,"Then the clan leaders, the leaders of the tribes of Isra’el, the captains of thousands and of hundreds, along with the supervisors over the king’s work offered willingly."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,29,7,"They gave for the service of the house of God 165 tons of gold, 330 tons of silver, 594 tons of bronze and 3,300 tons of iron."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,29,8,"Those who had precious stones gave them to the storehouse of the house of ADONAI, supervised by Yechi’el the Gershuni."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,29,9,"The people were filled with joy, because they had given willingly — wholeheartedly they had given willingly to ADONAI; and David the king too was completely filled with joy"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,29,10,"as he blessed ADONAI before the entire community: “Blessed be you, ADONAI, the God of Isra’el our father, forever and ever."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,29,11,"Yours, ADONAI, is the greatness, the power, the glory, the victory and the majesty; for everything in heaven and on earth is yours. The kingdom is yours, ADONAI; and you are exalted as head over all."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,29,12,"Riches and honor come from you, you rule everything, in your hand is power and strength, you have the capacity to make great and to give strength to all."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,29,13,"Therefore, our God, we thank you and praise your glorious name."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,29,14,"“But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to give so willingly in this way? For all things come from you, so that we have given you what is already yours."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,29,15,"For in your presence we are temporary residents, just passing through, as all our ancestors were — our days on earth are like a shadow, without hope."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,29,16,"ADONAI our God, all these supplies that we have prepared in order to build you a house for your holy name come from your own hand, all of it is already yours."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,29,17,"I know also, my God, that you test the heart and take pleasure in integrity. As for myself, I have given all these things willingly, in the integrity of my heart; and now, with joy, I have seen your people who are present here give willingly to you."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,29,18,"ADONAI, God of Avraham, Yitz’chak and Isra’el our ancestors, guard forever the inclinations of the thoughts in the hearts of your people; direct their hearts to you"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,29,19,"and give to Shlomo my son wholeheartedness to obey your mitzvot, instructions and rules, to do all these things, and to build the palace for which I have made provision.”"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,29,20,"Then David said to all the community, “Now bless ADONAI your God.” All the community blessed ADONAI, the God of their ancestors, bowing their heads and prostrating themselves before ADONAI and before the king."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,29,21,"On the following day they presented sacrifices to ADONAI and offered burnt offerings to ADONAI — a thousand bulls, a thousand rams and a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings — and sacrifices in abundance for all Isra’el."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,29,22,"They ate and drank before ADONAI that day with great joy.
Then, for the second time, they made Shlomo the son of David king, anointing him before ADONAI to be king, and Tzadok to be cohen."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,29,23,"Shlomo sat on the throne of ADONAI as king in place of David his father and prospered, and all Isra’el obeyed him."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,29,24,"All the leaders, the warrior-heroes and likewise the sons of King David submitted themselves to Shlomo the king."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,29,25,"ADONAI gave Shlomo exceedingly great power, in full view of all Isra’el, and bestowed on him royal majesty such as had not been seen on any king before him in Isra’el."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,29,26,Now David the son of Yishai ruled over all Isra’el.
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,29,27,"The duration of his reign over Isra’el was forty years; he reigned seven years in Hevron, and he reigned thirty-three years in Yerushalayim."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,29,28,"Then he died, at a ripe old age, full of years, riches and honor; and Shlomo his son reigned in his place."
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,29,29,"The activities of David the king, from first to last, are written in the records of Sh’mu’el the seer, Natan the prophet and Gad the seer"
Divrei-HamYamim Alef,29,30,"with all his reign and his power, and the events that he, Isra’el and the kingdoms of other countries experienced."
