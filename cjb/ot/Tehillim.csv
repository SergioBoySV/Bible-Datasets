without turning back until they were destroyed."

and bent down my adversaries beneath me."

Tehillim,33,11,"But the counsel of ADONAI stands forever,
his heart’s plans are for all generations."
Tehillim,33,12,"How blessed is the nation whose God is ADONAI,
the people he chose as his heritage!"
Tehillim,33,13,"ADONAI looks out from heaven;
he sees every human being"
Tehillim,33,14,"from the place where he lives
he watches everyone living on earth"
Tehillim,33,15,"he who fashioned the hearts of them all
and understands all they do."
Tehillim,33,16,"A king is not saved by the size of his army,
a strong man not delivered by his great strength."
Tehillim,33,17,"To rely on a horse for safety is vain,
nor does its great power assure escape."
Tehillim,33,18,"But ADONAI’s eyes watch over those who fear him,
over those who wait for his grace"
Tehillim,33,19,"to rescue them from death
and keep them alive in famine."
Tehillim,33,20,"We are waiting for ADONAI;
he is our help and shield."
Tehillim,33,21,"For in him our hearts rejoice,
because we trust in his holy name."
Tehillim,33,22,"May your mercy, ADONAI, be over us,
because we put our hope in you."
Tehillim,34,1,"By David, when he pretended to be insane before Avimelekh, who then drove him away; so he left"
Tehillim,34,2,"I will bless ADONAI at all times;
his praise will always be in my mouth."
Tehillim,34,3,"When I boast, it will be about ADONAI;
the humble will hear of it and be glad."
Tehillim,34,4,"Proclaim with me the greatness of ADONAI;
let us exalt his name together."
Tehillim,34,5,"I sought ADONAI, and he answered me;
he rescued me from everything I feared."
Tehillim,34,6,"They looked to him and grew radiant;
their faces will never blush for shame."
Tehillim,34,7,"This poor man cried; ADONAI heard
and saved him from all his troubles."
Tehillim,34,8,"The angel of ADONAI, who encamps
around those who fear him, delivers them."
Tehillim,34,9,"Taste, and see that ADONAI is good.
How blessed are those who take refuge in him!"
Tehillim,34,10,"Fear ADONAI, you holy ones of his,
for those who fear him lack nothing."
Tehillim,34,11,"Young lions can be needy, they can go hungry,
but those who seek ADONAI lack nothing good."
Tehillim,34,12,"Come, children, listen to me;
I will teach you the fear of ADONAI."
Tehillim,34,13,"Which of you takes pleasure in living?
Who wants a long life to see good things?"
Tehillim,34,14,"[If you do,] keep your tongue from evil
and your lips from deceiving talk"
Tehillim,34,15,"turn from evil, and do good;
seek peace, go after it!"
Tehillim,34,16,"The eyes of ADONAI watch over the righteous,
and his ears are open to their cry."
Tehillim,34,17,"But the face of ADONAI opposes those who do evil,
to cut off all memory of them from the earth."
Tehillim,34,18,"[The righteous] cried out, and ADONAI heard,
and he saved them from all their troubles."
Tehillim,34,19,"ADONAI is near those with broken hearts;
he saves those whose spirit is crushed."
Tehillim,34,20,"The righteous person suffers many evils,
but ADONAI rescues him out of them all."
Tehillim,34,21,"He protects all his bones;
not one of them gets broken."
Tehillim,34,22,"Evil will kill the wicked,
and those who hate the righteous will be condemned."
Tehillim,34,23,"But ADONAI redeems his servants;
no one who takes refuge in him will be condemned."
Tehillim,35,1,"By David:
ADONAI, oppose those who oppose me;
fight against those who fight against me."
Tehillim,35,2,"Grasp your shield and protective gear,
and rise to my defense."
Tehillim,35,3,"Brandish spear and battle-axe
against my pursuers;
let me hear you say,
“I am your salvation.”"
Tehillim,35,4,"May those who seek my life
be disgraced and put to confusion;
may those who are plotting harm for me
be repulsed and put to shame."
Tehillim,35,5,"May they be like chaff before the wind,
with the angel of ADONAI to drive them on."
Tehillim,35,6,"May their way be dark and slippery,
with the angel of ADONAI to pursue them."
Tehillim,35,7,"For unprovoked, they hid their net over a pit;
unprovoked, they dug it for me."
Tehillim,35,8,"May destruction come over him unawares.
May the net he concealed catch himself;
may he fall into it and be destroyed."
Tehillim,35,9,"Then I will be joyful in ADONAI,
I will rejoice in his salvation."
Tehillim,35,10,"All my bones will say,
“Who is like you?
Who can rescue the weak
from those stronger than they,
the poor and needy
from those who exploit them?”"
Tehillim,35,11,"Malicious witnesses come forward,
asking me things about which I know nothing."
Tehillim,35,12,"They repay me evil for good;
it makes me feel desolate as a parent bereaved."
Tehillim,35,13,"But I, when they were ill, wore sackcloth;
I put myself out and fasted;
I can pray that what I prayed for them
might also happen to me."
Tehillim,35,14,"I behaved as I would for my friend or my brother;
I bent down in sorrow as if mourning my mother."
Tehillim,35,15,"But when I stumble, they gather in glee;
they gather against me and strike me unawares;
they tear me apart unceasingly."
Tehillim,35,16,"With ungodly mocking and grimacing,
they grind their teeth at me."
Tehillim,35,17,"Adonai, how much longer will you look on?
Rescue me from their assaults,
save the one life I have from the lions!"
Tehillim,35,18,"I will give you thanks in the great assembly,
I will give you praise among huge crowds of people."
Tehillim,35,19,"Don’t let those who are wrongfully my enemies
gloat over me;
and those who hate me unprovoked —
don’t let them smirk at me."
Tehillim,35,20,"For they don’t speak words of peace
but devise ways to deceive
the peaceful of the land."
Tehillim,35,21,"They shout to accuse me, “Aha! Aha!
we saw you with our own eyes!”"
Tehillim,35,22,"You saw them, ADONAI; don’t stay silent.
Adonai, don’t stay far away from me."
Tehillim,35,23,"Wake up! Get up, my God, my Lord!
Defend me and my cause!"
Tehillim,35,24,"Give judgment for me, ADONAI, my God,
as your righteousness demands.
Don’t let them gloat over me."
Tehillim,35,25,"Don’t let them say to themselves,
“Aha! We got what we wanted!”
or say, “We swallowed them up!”"
Tehillim,35,26,"May those who gloat over my distress
be disgraced and humiliated.
May those who aggrandize themselves at my expense
be covered with shame and confusion."
Tehillim,35,27,"But may those who delight in my righteousness
shout for joy and be glad!
Let them say always, “How great is ADONAI,
who delights in the peace of his servant!”"
Tehillim,35,28,"Then my tongue will tell of your righteousness
and praise you all day long."
Tehillim,36,1,"For the leader. By David, the servant of ADONAI"
Tehillim,36,2,"Crime speaks to the wicked.
I perceive this in my heart;
before his eyes there is no fear
of God."
Tehillim,36,3,"For, the way he sees it,
crime makes his life easy —
that is, until his wrongs are discovered;
then, he is hated."
Tehillim,36,4,"His words are wrong and deceitful;
he has stopped being wise and doing good."
Tehillim,36,5,"He devises trouble as he lies in bed;
so set is he on his own bad way
that he doesn’t hate evil."
Tehillim,36,6,"ADONAI, in the heavens is your grace;
your faithfulness reaches to the skies."
Tehillim,36,7,"Your righteousness is like the mountains of God,
your judgments are like the great deep.
You save man and beast, ADONAI."
Tehillim,36,8,"How precious, God, is your grace!
People take refuge in the shadow of your wings"
Tehillim,36,9,"they feast on the rich bounty of your house,
and you have them drink from the stream of your delights."
Tehillim,36,10,"For with you is the fountain of life;
in your light we see light."
Tehillim,36,11,"Continue your grace to those who know you
and your righteousness to the upright in heart."
Tehillim,36,12,"Don’t let the foot of the proud tread on me
or the hands of the wicked drive me away."
Tehillim,36,13,"There they lie fallen, those evildoers,
flung down and unable to rise."
Tehillim,37,1,"By David:
Don’t be upset by evildoers
or envious of those who do wrong"
Tehillim,37,2,"for soon they will wither like grass
and fade like the green in the fields."
Tehillim,37,3,"Trust in ADONAI, and do good;
settle in the land, and feed on faithfulness."
Tehillim,37,4,"Then you will delight yourself in ADONAI,
and he will give you your heart’s desire."
Tehillim,37,5,"Commit your way to ADONAI;
trust in him, and he will act."
Tehillim,37,6,"He will make your vindication shine forth like light,
the justice of your cause like the noonday sun."
Tehillim,37,7,"Be still before ADONAI;
wait patiently till he comes.
Don’t be upset by those whose way
succeeds because of their wicked plans."
Tehillim,37,8,"Stop being angry, put aside rage,
and don’t be upset — it leads to evil."
Tehillim,37,9,"For evildoers will be cut off,
but those hoping in ADONAI will inherit the land."
Tehillim,37,10,"Soon the wicked will be no more;
you will look for his place, and he won’t be there."
Tehillim,37,11,"But the meek will inherit the land
and delight themselves in abundant peace."
Tehillim,37,12,"The wicked plots against the righteous
and grinds his teeth at him"
Tehillim,37,13,"but Adonai laughs at the wicked,
knowing his day will come."
Tehillim,37,14,"The wicked have unsheathed their swords,
they have strung their bows
to bring down the poor and needy,
to slaughter those whose way is upright."
Tehillim,37,15,"But their swords will pierce their own hearts,
and their bows will be broken."
Tehillim,37,16,"Better the little that the righteous has
than the wealth of all the wicked."
Tehillim,37,17,"For the arms of the wicked will be broken,
but ADONAI upholds the righteous."
Tehillim,37,18,"ADONAI knows what the wholehearted suffer,
but their inheritance lasts forever."
Tehillim,37,19,"They will not be distressed when times are hard;
when famine comes, they will have plenty."
Tehillim,37,20,"For the wicked will perish;
ADONAI’s enemies will be like sheep fat,
ending up as smoke, finished."
Tehillim,37,21,"The wicked borrows and doesn’t repay,
but the righteous is generous and gives."
Tehillim,37,22,"For those blessed by [ADONAI] will inherit the land,
but those cursed by him will be cut off."
Tehillim,37,23,"ADONAI directs a person’s steps,
and he delights in his way."
Tehillim,37,24,"He may stumble, but he won’t fall headlong,
for ADONAI holds him by the hand."
Tehillim,37,25,"I have been young; now I am old;
yet not once have I seen the righteous abandoned
or his descendants begging for bread."
Tehillim,37,26,"All day long he is generous and lends,
and his descendants are blessed."
Tehillim,37,27,"If you turn from evil and do good,
you will live safely forever."
Tehillim,37,28,"For ADONAI loves justice
and will not abandon his faithful;
they are preserved forever.
But the descendants of the wicked will be cut off."
Tehillim,37,29,"The righteous will inherit the land
and live in it forever."
Tehillim,37,30,"The mouth of the righteous articulates wisdom,
his tongue speaks justice."
Tehillim,37,31,"The Torah of his God is in his heart;
his footsteps do not falter."
Tehillim,37,32,"The wicked keeps his eye on the righteous,
seeking a chance to kill him."
Tehillim,37,33,"But ADONAI will not leave him in his power
or let him be condemned when judged."
Tehillim,37,34,"Put your hope in ADONAI, keep to his way,
and he will raise you up to inherit the land.
When the wicked are cut off, you will see it."
Tehillim,37,35,"I have seen a wicked man wielding great power,
flourishing like a shade tree in its native soil."
Tehillim,37,36,"But I passed by again, and he was no longer there;
I looked for him, but he could not be found."
Tehillim,37,37,"Observe the pure person, consider the upright;
for the peaceful person will have posterity."
Tehillim,37,38,"But transgressors will all be destroyed;
the posterity of the wicked will be cut off."
Tehillim,37,39,"ADONAI is the one who saves the righteous;
he is their stronghold in time of trouble."
Tehillim,37,40,"ADONAI helps them and rescues them,
rescues them from the wicked and saves them;
because they take refuge in him."
Tehillim,38,1,"A psalm of David, serving as a reminder"
Tehillim,38,2,"ADONAI, don’t rebuke me when you are angry
or discipline me when you are enraged"
Tehillim,38,3,"for your arrows penetrate me deeply,
and your hand is pressing me down."
Tehillim,38,4,"Your indignation left no part of me intact;
my sin made my whole body sick"
Tehillim,38,5,"for my iniquities loom high over my head
as a heavy burden, too heavy for me."
Tehillim,38,6,"I have stinking, festering wounds
because of my foolishness."
Tehillim,38,7,"I am bent down, prostrate completely;
I go about mourning all day long."
Tehillim,38,8,"For my insides burn with fever,
and my whole body is sick."
Tehillim,38,9,"I am numb, completely crushed;
my anguished heart makes me groan aloud."
Tehillim,38,10,"Adonai, all my longing is known to you;
my sighing is not hidden from you."
Tehillim,38,11,"My heart is throbbing, my strength is gone,
and the light in my eyes has left me."
Tehillim,38,12,"My friends and companions shun my disease;
even the closest keep their distance."
Tehillim,38,13,"Those seeking my life lay snares for me,
those seeking to harm me speak of disaster
and think up deceptions all day long."
Tehillim,38,14,"But I’m like a deaf man — I don’t hear it;
and, like a mute, I don’t say a word."
Tehillim,38,15,"Yes, I’ve become like a man who doesn’t hear
and in whose mouth are no defenses."
Tehillim,38,16,"For it is in you, ADONAI, that I hope.
You will answer, Adonai my God."
Tehillim,38,17,"I said, “Don’t let them gloat over me
or boast against me when my foot slips.”"
Tehillim,38,18,"For I am about to fall,
and my pain is always with me."
Tehillim,38,19,"I acknowledge my guilt,
I am anxious because of my sin."
Tehillim,38,20,"But my enemies are alive and well,
those who wrongfully hate me increase their numbers"
Tehillim,38,21,"and, since they repay good with evil,
they oppose me because I pursue good."
Tehillim,38,22,"Don’t abandon me, ADONAI!
My God, don’t be far from me!"
Tehillim,38,23,"Come quickly to help me,
Adonai, my salvation!"
Tehillim,39,1,For the leader. Set in the style of Y’dutun. A psalm of David
Tehillim,39,2,"I said, “I will watch how I behave,
so that I won’t sin with my tongue;
I will put a muzzle on my mouth
whenever the wicked confront me.”"
Tehillim,39,3,"I was silent, said nothing, not even good;
but my pain kept being stirred up."
Tehillim,39,4,"My heart grew hot within me;
whenever I thought of it, the fire burned.
Then, [at last,] I let my tongue speak"
Tehillim,39,5,"“Make me grasp, ADONAI, what my end must be,
what it means that my days are numbered;
let me know what a transient creature I am."
Tehillim,39,6,"You have made my days like handbreadths;
for you, the length of my life is like nothing.”
Yes, everyone, no matter how firmly he stands,
is merely a puff of wind. (Selah)"
Tehillim,39,7,"Humans go about like shadows;
their turmoil is all for nothing.
They accumulate wealth, not knowing
who will enjoy its benefits."
Tehillim,39,8,"Now, Adonai, what am I waiting for?
You are my only hope."
Tehillim,39,9,"Rescue me from all my transgressions;
don’t make me the butt of fools."
Tehillim,39,10,"I am silent, I keep my mouth shut,
because it is you who have done it."
Tehillim,39,11,"Stop raining blows on me;
the pounding of your fist is wearing me down."
Tehillim,39,12,"With rebukes you discipline people for their guilt;
like a moth, you destroy what makes them attractive;
yes, everyone is merely a puff of wind. (Selah)"
Tehillim,39,13,"Hear my prayer, ADONAI, listen to my cry,
don’t be deaf to my weeping;
for with you, I am just a traveler
passing through, like all my ancestors."
Tehillim,39,14,"Turn your gaze from me, so I can smile again
before I depart and cease to exist."
Tehillim,40,1,For the leader. A psalm of David
Tehillim,40,2,"I waited patiently for ADONAI,
till he turned toward me and heard my cry."
Tehillim,40,3,"He brought me up from the roaring pit,
up from the muddy ooze,
and set my feet on a rock,
making my footing firm."
Tehillim,40,4,"He put a new song in my mouth,
a song of praise to our God.
Many will look on in awe
and put their trust in ADONAI."
Tehillim,40,5,"How blessed the man who trusts in ADONAI
and does not look to the arrogant
or to those who rely on things that are false."
Tehillim,40,6,"How much you have done, ADONAI my God!
Your wonders and your thoughts toward us —
none can compare with you!
I would proclaim them, I would speak about them;
but there’s too much to tell!"
Tehillim,40,7,"Sacrifices and grain offerings you don’t want;
burnt offerings and sin offerings you don’t demand.
Instead, you have given me open ears"
Tehillim,40,8,"so then I said, “Here I am! I’m coming!
In the scroll of a book it is written about me."
Tehillim,40,9,"Doing your will, my God, is my joy;
your Torah is in my inmost being."
Tehillim,40,10,"I have proclaimed what is right in the great assembly;
I did not restrain my lips, ADONAI, as you know."
Tehillim,40,11,"I did not hide your righteousness in my heart
but declared your faithfulness and salvation;
I did not conceal your grace and truth
from the great assembly.”"
Tehillim,40,12,"ADONAI, don’t withhold your mercy from me.
Let your grace and truth preserve me always."
Tehillim,40,13,"For numberless evils surround me;
my iniquities engulf me — I can’t even see;
there are more of them than hairs on my head,
so that my courage fails me."
Tehillim,40,14,"Be pleased, ADONAI, to rescue me!
ADONAI, hurry and help me!"
Tehillim,40,15,"May those who seek to sweep me away
be disgraced and humiliated together.
May those who take pleasure in doing me harm
be turned back and put to confusion."
Tehillim,40,16,"May those who jeer at me, “Aha! Aha!”
be aghast because of their shame."
Tehillim,40,17,"But may all those who seek you
be glad and take joy in you.
May those who love your salvation say always,
“ADONAI is great and glorious!”"
Tehillim,40,18,"But I am poor and needy;
may Adonai think of me.
You are my helper and rescuer;
my God, don’t delay!"
Tehillim,41,1,For the leader. A psalm of David
Tehillim,41,2,"How blessed are those who care for the poor!
When calamity comes, ADONAI will save them."
Tehillim,41,3,"ADONAI will preserve them, keep them alive,
and make them happy in the land.
You will not hand them over
to the whims of their enemies."
Tehillim,41,4,"ADONAI sustains them on their sickbed;
when they lie ill, you make them recover."
Tehillim,41,5,"I said, “ADONAI, have pity on me!
Heal me, for I have sinned against you!”"
Tehillim,41,6,"My enemies say the worst about me:
“When will he die and his name disappear?”"
Tehillim,41,7,"When they come to see me they speak insincerely,
their hearts meanwhile gathering falsehoods;
then they go out and spread bad reports."
Tehillim,41,8,"All who hate me whisper together against me,
imagining the worst about me."
Tehillim,41,9,"“A fatal disease has attached itself to him;
now that he lies ill, he will never get up.”"
Tehillim,41,10,"Even my close friend, on whom I relied,
who shared my table, has turned against me."
Tehillim,41,11,"But you, ADONAI, have pity on me,
put me on my feet, so I can pay them back."
Tehillim,41,12,"I will know you are pleased with me
if my enemy doesn’t defeat me."
Tehillim,41,13,"You uphold me because of my innocence
you establish me in your presence forever."
Tehillim,41,14,"Blessed be ADONAI the God of Isra’el
from eternity past to eternity future.
Amen. Amen."
Tehillim,42,1,For the leader. A maskil of the descendants of Korach
Tehillim,42,2,"Just as a deer longs for running streams,
God, I long for you."
Tehillim,42,3,"I am thirsty for God, for the living God!
When can I come and appear before God?"
Tehillim,42,4,"My tears are my food, day and night,
while all day people ask me, “Where is your God?”"
Tehillim,42,5,"I recall, as my feelings well up within me,
how I’d go with the crowd to the house of God,
with sounds of joy and praise from the throngs
observing the festival."
Tehillim,42,6,"My soul, why are you so downcast?
Why are you groaning inside me?
Hope in God, since I will praise him again
for the salvation that comes from his presence."
Tehillim,42,7,"My God, when I feel so downcast,
I remind myself of you
from the land of Yarden, from the peaks of Hermon,
from the hill Mizar."
Tehillim,42,8,"Deep is calling to deep
at the thunder of your waterfalls;
all your surging rapids and waves
are sweeping over me."
Tehillim,42,9,"By day ADONAI commands his grace,
and at night his song is with me
as a prayer to the God of my life."
Tehillim,42,10,"I say to God my Rock,
“Why have you forgotten me?
Why must I go about mourning,
under pressure by the enemy?"
Tehillim,42,11,"My adversaries’ taunts make me feel
as if my bones were crushed,
as they ask me all day long,
‘Where is your God?’ ”"
Tehillim,42,12,"My soul, why are you so downcast?
Why are you groaning inside me?
Hope in God, since I will praise him again
for being my Savior and God."
Tehillim,43,1,"Judge me, God, and plead my cause
against a faithless nation.
Rescue me from those who deceive
and from those who are unjust."
Tehillim,43,2,"For you are the God of my strength;
why have you thrust me aside?
Why must I go about mourning,
under pressure by the enemy?"
Tehillim,43,3,"Send out your light and your truth;
let them be my guide;
let them lead me to your holy mountain,
to the places where you live."
Tehillim,43,4,"Then I will go to the altar of God,
to God, my joy and delight;
I will praise you on the lyre,
God, my God."
Tehillim,43,5,"My soul, why are you so downcast?
Why are you groaning inside me?
Hope in God, since I will praise him again
for being my Savior and God."
Tehillim,44,1,For the leader. By the descendants of Korach. A maskil
Tehillim,44,2,"God, we heard it with our ears;
our fathers told us about it —
a deed which you did in their days,
back in days of old."
Tehillim,44,3,"With your hand you drove out nations
to plant them in [the land],
you crushed peoples
to make room for them."
Tehillim,44,4,"For not by their own swords
did they conquer the land,
nor did their own arm
give them victory;
rather, it was your right hand,
your arm and the light of your face;
because you favored them."
Tehillim,44,5,"God, you are my king;
command complete victory for Ya‘akov."
Tehillim,44,6,"Through you we pushed away our foes,
through your name we trampled down our assailants."
Tehillim,44,7,"For I don’t rely on my bow,
nor can my sword give me victory."
Tehillim,44,8,"No, you saved us from our adversaries;
you put to shame those who hate us."
Tehillim,44,9,"We will boast in our God all day
and give thanks to your name forever. (Selah)"
Tehillim,44,10,"Yet now you have thrust us aside and disgraced us;
you don’t march out with our armies."
Tehillim,44,11,"You make us retreat from the adversary,
and those who hate us plunder us at will."
Tehillim,44,12,"You have handed us over like sheep to be eaten
and scattered us among the nations."
Tehillim,44,13,"You sell your people for a pittance,
you don’t even profit on the sale."
Tehillim,44,14,"You make us an object for our neighbors to mock,
one of scorn and derision to those around us."
Tehillim,44,15,"You make us a byword among the nations;
the peoples jeer at us, shaking their heads."
Tehillim,44,16,"All day long my disgrace is on my mind,
and shame has covered my face"
Tehillim,44,17,"at the sound of those who revile and insult,
at the sight of the enemy bent on revenge."
Tehillim,44,18,"Though all this came on us, we did not forget you;
we have not been false to your covenant"
Tehillim,44,19,"Our hearts have not turned back,
and our steps did not turn away from your path"
Tehillim,44,20,"though you pressed us into a lair of jackals
and covered us with death-dark gloom."
Tehillim,44,21,"If we had forgotten the name of our God
or spread out our hands to a foreign god"
Tehillim,44,22,"wouldn’t God have discovered this,
since he knows the secrets of the heart?"

we are considered sheep to be slaughtered."
Tehillim,44,24,"Wake up, Adonai! Why are you asleep?
Rouse yourself! Don’t thrust us off forever."

forgetting our pain and misery?"

our bodies cling to the ground."

For the sake of your grace, redeem us!"

the joy of all the earth,
Mount Tziyon, in the far north,
the city of the great king."

has been revealed as a strong defense."
Tehillim,48,5,"For the kings met by agreement;
together they advanced."
Tehillim,48,6,"They saw and were filled with consternation;
terrified, they took to flight."
Tehillim,48,7,"Trembling took hold of them,
pains like those of a woman in labor"
Tehillim,48,8,"as when the wind out of the east
wrecks the “Tarshish” ships."

and boast how rich they are?"
Tehillim,49,8,"No one can ever redeem his brother
or give God a ransom for him "
Tehillim,49,9,"because the price for him is too high
(leave the idea completely alone!)"
Tehillim,49,10,"to have him live on eternally
and never see the pit."
Tehillim,49,11,"For he can see that wise men will die,
likewise the fool and the brute will perish
and leave their wealth to others."
Tehillim,49,12,"They think their homes will last forever,
their dwellings through all generations;
they give their own names to their estates."
Tehillim,49,13,"But people, even rich ones, will live only briefly;
then, like animals, they will die."

and those who come after, approving their words. (Selah)"

because he will receive me. (Selah)"

his wealth will not go down after him."

people praise you when you do well for yourself "
Tehillim,49,20,"but he will join his ancestors’ generations
and never again see light."

that, like animals, they will die."

your burnt offerings are always before me."

whatever moves in the fields is mine."
Tehillim,50,12,"If I were hungry, I would not tell you;
for the world is mine, and everything in it."

pay your vows to the Most High"
Tehillim,50,15,"and call on me when you are in trouble;
I will deliver you, and you will honor me.”"
Tehillim,50,16,"But to the wicked God says:
“What right do you have to proclaim my laws
or take my covenant on your lips"
Tehillim,50,17,"when you so hate to receive instruction
and fling my words behind you?"
Tehillim,50,18,"When you see a thief, you join up with him,
you throw in your lot with adulterers"
Tehillim,50,19,"you give your mouth free rein for evil
and harness your tongue to deceit"
Tehillim,50,20,"you sit and speak against your kinsman,
you slander your own mother’s son."
Tehillim,50,21,"When you do such things, should I stay silent?
You may have thought I was just like you;
but I will rebuke and indict you to your face."
Tehillim,50,22,"Consider this, you who forget God,
or I will tear you to pieces, with no one to save you."

as his sacrifice honors me;
and to him who goes the right way
I will show the salvation of God.”"

Tehillim,51,2,when Natan the prophet came to him after his affair with Bat-Sheva
Tehillim,51,3,"God, in your grace, have mercy on me;
in your great compassion, blot out my crimes."
Tehillim,51,4,"Wash me completely from my guilt,
and cleanse me from my sin."
Tehillim,51,5,"For I know my crimes,
my sin confronts me all the time."
Tehillim,51,6,"Against you, you only, have I sinned
and done what is evil from your perspective;
so that you are right in accusing me
and justified in passing sentence."
Tehillim,51,7,"True, I was born guilty,
was a sinner from the moment my mother conceived me."
Tehillim,51,8,"Still, you want truth in the inner person;
so make me know wisdom in my inmost heart."
Tehillim,51,9,"Sprinkle me with hyssop, and I will be clean;
wash me, and I will be whiter than snow."

Tehillim,51,15,"Then I will teach the wicked your ways,
and sinners will return to you."

God, God of my salvation!
Then my tongue will sing
about your righteousness "
Tehillim,51,17,"Adonai, open my lips;
then my mouth will praise you."
Tehillim,51,18,"For you don’t want sacrifices, or I would give them;
you don’t take pleasure in burnt offerings."
Tehillim,51,19,"My sacrifice to God is a broken spirit;
God, you won’t spurn a broken, chastened heart."
Tehillim,51,20,"In your good pleasure, make Tziyon prosper;
rebuild the walls of Yerushalayim."
Tehillim,51,21,"Then you will delight in righteous sacrifices,
in burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings;
then they will offer bulls on your altar."
Tehillim,52,1,For the leader. A maskil of David
Tehillim,52,2,"when Do’eg from Edom came and told Sha’ul, “David has arrived at the house of Achimelekh”"
Tehillim,52,3,"Why do you boast of your evil, you tyrant,
when God’s mercy is present every day?"
Tehillim,52,4,"Your tongue, as sharp as a razor,
plots destruction and works deception."
Tehillim,52,5,"You love evil more than good,
lies rather than speaking uprightly. (Selah)"
Tehillim,52,6,"You love all words that eat people up,
you deceitful tongue!"
Tehillim,52,7,"This is why God will strike you down,
seize you, pluck you from your tent
and uproot you from the land of the living. (Selah)"
Tehillim,52,8,"The righteous will see and be awestruck;
they will jeer at him, saying"
Tehillim,52,9,"“This fellow would not make God his refuge,
but trusted in his own great wealth,
relying on his evil plots.”"
Tehillim,52,10,"But I am like a leafy olive tree
in the house of God;
I put my trust in the grace of God
forever and ever."
Tehillim,52,11,"I will praise you forever for what you have done,
and I will put my hope in your name;
for this is what is good
in the presence of your faithful."
Tehillim,53,1,For the leader. On machalat. A maskil of David
Tehillim,53,2,"A brutish fool tells himself,
“There isn’t any God.”
Such people are depraved, all their deeds are vile,
not one of them does what is good."
Tehillim,53,3,"God looks out from heaven
upon the human race
to see if even one is wise,
if even one seeks God."
Tehillim,53,4,"Every one of them is unclean,
altogether corrupt;
not one of them does what is good,
not a single one."
Tehillim,53,5,"Won’t these evildoers ever learn?
They devour my people
as if they were eating bread,
and they never call on God!"
Tehillim,53,6,"They will be gripped with terror,
even though now they are not afraid;
for God will scatter the bones
of him who is besieging you.
You are putting them to shame,
because God has rejected them."
Tehillim,53,7,"If only salvation for Isra’el
would come out of Tziyon!
When God restores his people’s fortunes,
what joy for Ya‘akov! what gladness for Isra’el!"
Tehillim,54,1,For the leader. With stringed instruments. A maskil of David
Tehillim,54,2,"when the Zifim came and told Sha’ul, “David is hiding with us”"
Tehillim,54,3,"God, deliver me by your name;
in your power, vindicate me."
Tehillim,54,4,"God, hear my prayer;
listen to the words from my mouth."
Tehillim,54,5,"For foreigners are rising against me,
violent men are seeking my life;
they give no thought to God. (Selah)"
Tehillim,54,6,"But God is helping me;
Adonai is my support."
Tehillim,54,7,"May he repay the evil
to those who are lying in wait for me.
In your faithfulness, destroy them!"
Tehillim,54,8,"Then I will generously sacrifice to you;
I will praise your name, ADONAI,
because it is good"
Tehillim,54,9,"because he rescued me from all trouble,
and my eyes look with triumph at my enemies."
Tehillim,55,1,For the leader. With stringed instruments. A maskil of David
Tehillim,55,2,"Listen, God, to my prayer!
Don’t hide yourself from my plea!"
Tehillim,55,3,"Pay attention to me, and answer me!
I am panic-stricken as I make my complaint,
I shudder"
Tehillim,55,4,"at how the enemy shouts,
at how the wicked oppress;
for they keep heaping trouble on me
and angrily tormenting me."
Tehillim,55,5,"My heart within me is pounding in anguish,
the terrors of death press down on me"
Tehillim,55,6,"fear and trembling overwhelm me,
horror covers me."
Tehillim,55,7,"I said, “I wish I had wings like a dove!
Then I could fly away and be at rest."
Tehillim,55,8,"Yes, I would flee to a place far off,
I would stay in the desert. (Selah)"
Tehillim,55,9,"I would quickly find me a shelter
from the raging wind and storm.”"
Tehillim,55,10,"Confuse, Adonai, confound their speech!
For I see violence and fighting in the city."
Tehillim,55,11,"Day and night they go about its walls;
within are malice and mischief."
Tehillim,55,12,"Ruin is rife within it,
oppression and fraud never leave its streets."
Tehillim,55,13,"For it was not an enemy who insulted me;
if it had been, I could have borne it.
It was not my adversary who treated me with scorn;
if it had been, I could have hidden myself."
Tehillim,55,14,"But it was you, a man of my own kind,
my companion, whom I knew well."
Tehillim,55,15,"We used to share our hearts with each other;
in the house of God we walked with the crowd."
Tehillim,55,16,"May he put death on them;
let them go down alive to Sh’ol;
for evil is in their homes
and also in their hearts."
Tehillim,55,17,"But I will call on God,
and ADONAI will save me."
Tehillim,55,18,"Evening, morning and noon I complain
and moan; but he hears my voice."
Tehillim,55,19,"He redeems me and gives me peace,
so that no one can come near me.
For there were many who fought me."
Tehillim,55,20,"God will hear and will humble them,
yes, he who has sat on his throne from the start. (Selah)
For they never change,
and they don’t fear God."
Tehillim,55,21,"[My companion] attacked those
who were at peace with him;
he broke his solemn word."
Tehillim,55,22,"What he said sounded smoother than butter,
but his heart was at war.
His words seemed more soothing than oil,
but in fact they were sharp swords."
Tehillim,55,23,"Unload your burden on ADONAI,
and he will sustain you.
He will never permit
the righteous to be moved."
Tehillim,55,24,"But you will bring them down, God,
into the deepest pit.
Those men, so bloodthirsty and treacherous,
will not live out half their days.
But for my part, [ADONAI,]
I put my trust in you."
Tehillim,56,1,"For the leader. Set to “The Silent Dove in the Distance.” By David; a mikhtam, when the P’lishtim captured him in Gat"
Tehillim,56,2,"Show me favor, God;
for people are trampling me down —
all day they fight and press on me."
Tehillim,56,3,"Those who are lying in wait for me
would trample on me all day.
For those fighting against me are many.
Most High"
Tehillim,56,4,"when I am afraid,
I put my trust in you."
Tehillim,56,5,"In God — I praise his word —
in God I trust; I have no fear;
what can human power do to me?"
Tehillim,56,6,"All day long they twist my words;
their only thought is to harm me."
Tehillim,56,7,"They gather together and hide themselves,
spying on my movements, hoping to kill me."
Tehillim,56,8,"Because of their crime, they cannot escape;
in anger, God, strike down the peoples."
Tehillim,56,9,"You have kept count of my wanderings;
store my tears in your water-skin —
aren’t they already recorded in your book?"
Tehillim,56,10,"Then my enemies will turn back
on the day when I call;
this I know: that God is for me."
Tehillim,56,11,"In God — I praise his word —
in ADONAI — I praise his word "
Tehillim,56,12,"in God I trust; I have no fear;
what can mere humans do to me?"
Tehillim,56,13,"God, I have made vows to you;
I will fulfill them with thank offerings to you."
Tehillim,56,14,"For you rescued me from death,
you kept my feet from stumbling,
so that I can walk in God’s presence,
in the light of life."
Tehillim,57,1,"For the leader. Set to “Do Not Destroy.” By David, a mikhtam, when he fled from Sha’ul into the cave"
Tehillim,57,2,"Show me favor, God, show me favor;
for in you I have taken refuge.
Yes, I will find refuge in the shadow of your wings
until the storms have passed."
Tehillim,57,3,"I call to God, the Most High,
to God, who is accomplishing his purpose for me."
Tehillim,57,4,"He will send from heaven and save me
when those who would trample me down mock me. (Selah)
God will send his grace and his truth."
Tehillim,57,5,"I am surrounded by lions,
I am lying down among people breathing fire,
men whose teeth are spears and arrows
and their tongues sharp-edged swords."
Tehillim,57,6,"Be exalted, God, above heaven!
May your glory be over all the earth!"
Tehillim,57,7,"They prepared a snare for my feet,
but I am bending over [to avoid it].
They dug a pit ahead of me,
but they fell into it themselves. (Selah)"
Tehillim,57,8,"My heart is steadfast, God, steadfast.
I will sing and make music."
Tehillim,57,9,"Awake, my glory! Awake, lyre and lute!
I will awaken the dawn."
Tehillim,57,10,"I will thank you, Adonai, among the peoples;
I will make music to you among the nations."
Tehillim,57,11,"For your grace is great, all the way to heaven,
and your truth, all the way to the skies."
Tehillim,57,12,"Be exalted, God, above heaven!
May your glory be over all the earth!"
Tehillim,58,1,"For the leader. Set to “Do Not Destroy.” By David, a mikhtam"
Tehillim,58,2,"[Rulers,] does your silence really speak justice?
Are you judging people fairly?"
Tehillim,58,3,"[No!] In your hearts you devise wrongs,
your hands dispense violence in the land."
Tehillim,58,4,"From the womb, the wicked are estranged,
liars on the wrong path since birth."
Tehillim,58,5,"Their venom is like snake’s venom;
they are like a serpent that stops its ears"
Tehillim,58,6,"so as not to hear the voice of the charmer,
no matter how well he plays."
Tehillim,58,7,"God, break their teeth in their mouth!
Shatter the fangs of these lions, ADONAI!"
Tehillim,58,8,"May they vanish like water that drains away.
May their arrows be blunted when they aim their bows."
Tehillim,58,9,"May they be like a slug that melts as it moves,
like a stillborn baby that never sees the sun."
Tehillim,58,10,"Before your cook-pots feel the heat of the burning thorns,
may he blow them away, green and blazing alike."
Tehillim,58,11,"The righteous will rejoice to see vengeance done,
they will wash their feet in the blood of the wicked"
Tehillim,58,12,"and people will say, “Yes, the righteous are rewarded;
there is, after all, a God who judges the earth.”"
Tehillim,59,1,"For the leader. Set to “Do Not Destroy.” By David; a mikhtam, when Sha’ul sent men to keep watch on David’s house in order to kill him"
Tehillim,59,2,"My God, rescue me from my enemies!
Lift me up, out of reach of my foes!"
Tehillim,59,3,"Rescue me from evildoers,
save me from bloodthirsty men."
Tehillim,59,4,"For there they are, lying in wait to kill me.
Openly they gather themselves against me,
and not because I committed a crime
or sinned, ADONAI."
Tehillim,59,5,"For no fault of mine, they run and prepare.
Awaken to help me, and see!"
Tehillim,59,6,"You, ADONAI Elohei-Tzva’ot,
God of Isra’el,
arouse yourself to punish all the nations;
spare none of those wicked traitors. (Selah)"
Tehillim,59,7,"They return at nightfall, snarling like dogs
as they go around the city."
Tehillim,59,8,"Look what pours out of their mouth,
what swords are on their lips,
[as they say to themselves,]
“No one is listening, anyway.”"
Tehillim,59,9,"But you, ADONAI, laugh at them,
you mock all the nations."
Tehillim,59,10,"My Strength, I will watch for you,
for God is my fortress."
Tehillim,59,11,"God, who gives me grace, will come to me;
God will let me gaze in triumph at my foes."
Tehillim,59,12,"Don’t kill them, or my people will forget;
instead, by your power, make them wander to and fro;
but bring them down, Adonai our Shield"
Tehillim,59,13,"for the sins their mouths make with each word from their lips.
Let them be trapped by their pride
for the curses and falsehoods they utter."
Tehillim,59,14,"Finish them off in wrath,
finish them off, put an end to them,
and let them know to the ends of the earth
that God is Ruler in Ya‘akov. (Selah)"
Tehillim,59,15,"They return at nightfall, snarling like dogs

Tehillim,73,2,"But as for me, I lost my balance,
my feet nearly slipped"
Tehillim,73,3,"when I grew envious of the arrogant
and saw how the wicked prosper."
Tehillim,73,4,"For when their death comes, it is painless;
and meanwhile, their bodies are healthy"
Tehillim,73,5,"they don’t have ordinary people’s troubles,
they aren’t plagued like others."
Tehillim,73,6,"So for them, pride is a necklace;
and violence clothes them like a robe."
Tehillim,73,7,"Their eyes peep out through folds of fat;
evil thoughts overflow from their hearts."
Tehillim,73,8,"They scoff and speak with malice,
they loftily utter threats."
Tehillim,73,9,"They set their mouths against heaven;
their tongues swagger through the earth."
Tehillim,73,10,"Therefore his people return here
and [thoughtlessly] suck up that whole cup of water."
Tehillim,73,11,"Then they ask, “How does God know?
Does the Most High really have knowledge?”"
Tehillim,73,12,"Yes, this is what the wicked are like;
those free of misfortune keep increasing their wealth."
Tehillim,73,13,"It’s all for nothing that I’ve kept my heart clean
and washed my hands, staying free of guilt"
Tehillim,73,14,"for all day long I am plagued;
my punishment comes every morning."
Tehillim,73,15,"If I had said, “I will talk like them,”
I would have betrayed a generation of your children."
Tehillim,73,16,"When I tried to understand all this,
I found it too hard for me "
Tehillim,73,17,"until I went into the sanctuaries of God
and grasped what their destiny would be."
Tehillim,73,18,"Indeed, you place them on a slippery slope
and make them fall to their ruin."
Tehillim,73,19,"How suddenly they are destroyed,
swept away by terrors!"
Tehillim,73,20,"They are like a dream when one awakens;
Adonai, when you rouse yourself,
you will despise their phantoms."
Tehillim,73,21,"When I had a sour attitude
and felt stung by pained emotions"
Tehillim,73,22,"I was too stupid to understand;
I was like a brute beast with you."
Tehillim,73,23,"Nevertheless, I am always with you;
you hold my right hand."
Tehillim,73,24,"You will guide me with your advice;
and afterwards, you will receive me with honor."
Tehillim,73,25,"Whom do I have in heaven but you?
And with you, I lack nothing on earth."
Tehillim,73,26,"My mind and body may fail; but God
is the rock for my mind and my portion forever."
Tehillim,73,27,"Those who are far from you will perish;
you destroy all who adulterously leave you."
Tehillim,73,28,"But for me, the nearness of God is my good;
I have made Adonai ELOHIM my refuge,
so that I can tell of all your works."
Tehillim,74,1,"A maskil of Asaf:
Why have you rejected us forever, God,
with your anger smoking against the sheep you once pastured?"
Tehillim,74,2,"Remember your community, which you acquired long ago,
the tribe you redeemed to be your very own.
Remember Mount Tziyon, where you came to live."
Tehillim,74,3,"Hurry your steps to these endless ruins,
to the sanctuary devastated by the enemy."
Tehillim,74,4,"The roar of your foes filled your meeting-place;
they raised their own banners as a sign of their conquest."
Tehillim,74,5,"The place seemed like a thicket of trees
when lumbermen hack away with their axes."
Tehillim,74,6,"With hatchet and hammer they banged away,
smashing all the carved woodwork."
Tehillim,74,7,"They set your sanctuary on fire,
tore down and profaned the abode of your name."
Tehillim,74,8,"They said to themselves, “We will oppress them completely.”
They have burned down all God’s meeting-places in the land."
Tehillim,74,9,"We see no signs, there is no prophet any more;
none of us knows how long it will last."
Tehillim,74,10,"How much longer, God, will the foe jeer at us?
Will the enemy insult your name forever?"
Tehillim,74,11,"Why do you hold back your hand?
Draw your right hand from your coat, and finish them off!"
Tehillim,74,12,"God has been my king from earliest times,
acting to save throughout all the earth."
Tehillim,74,13,"By your strength you split the sea in two,
in the water you smashed sea monsters’ heads"
Tehillim,74,14,"you crushed the heads of Livyatan
and gave it as food to the creatures of the desert."
Tehillim,74,15,"You cut channels for springs and streams,
you dried up rivers that had never failed."
Tehillim,74,16,"The day is yours, and the night is yours;
it was you who established light and sun."
Tehillim,74,17,"It was you who fixed all the limits of the earth,
you made summer and winter."
Tehillim,74,18,"Remember how the enemy scoffs at ADONAI,
how a brutish people insults your name."
Tehillim,74,19,"Don’t hand over the soul of your dove to wild beasts,
don’t forget forever the life of your poor."
Tehillim,74,20,"Look to the covenant, for the land’s dark places
are full of the haunts of violence."
Tehillim,74,21,"Don’t let the oppressed retreat in confusion;
let the poor and needy praise your name."
Tehillim,74,22,"Arise, God, and defend your cause;

and to the wicked, “Don’t flaunt your strength!"
Tehillim,75,6,"Don’t flaunt your strength so proudly;
don’t speak arrogantly, with your nose in the air!"
Tehillim,75,7,"For you will not be raised to power
by those in the east, the west or the desert"
Tehillim,75,8,"since God is the judge; and it is he
who puts down one and lifts up another."
Tehillim,75,9,"In ADONAI’s hand there is a cup of wine,
foaming, richly spiced;

will drain it, drinking it to the dregs.”"

riders and horses lie stunned."
Tehillim,76,8,"You are fearsome! When once you are angry,
who can stand in your presence?"
Tehillim,76,9,"You pronounce sentence from heaven;
the earth grows silent with fear"

to save all the humble of the earth. (Selah)"
Tehillim,76,11,"Human wrath serves only to praise you;
what remains of this wrath you wear as an ornament."

Tehillim,77,1,For the leader. For Y’dutun. A psalm of Asaf
Tehillim,77,2,"I cry aloud to God,
aloud to God; and he hears me."

when I ponder, my spirit fails. (Selah)"

I am too troubled to speak."
Tehillim,77,6,"I think about the days of old,
the years of long ago"
Tehillim,77,7,"in the night I remember my song,
I commune with myself, my spirit inquires"
Tehillim,77,8,"“Will Adonai reject forever?
will he never show his favor again?"
Tehillim,77,9,"Has his grace permanently disappeared?
Is his word to all generations done away?"
Tehillim,77,10,"Has God forgotten to be compassionate?
Has he in anger withheld his mercy?” (Selah)"
Tehillim,77,11,"Then I add, “That’s my weakness —
[supposing] the Most High’s right hand could change.”"
Tehillim,77,12,"So I will remind myself of Yah’s doings;
yes, I will remember your wonders of old."
Tehillim,77,13,"I will meditate on your work
and think about what you have done."
Tehillim,77,14,"God, your way is in holiness.
What god is as great as God?"
Tehillim,77,15,"You are the God who does wonders,
you revealed your strength to the peoples."
Tehillim,77,16,"With your arm you redeemed your people,
the descendants of Ya‘akov and Yosef. (Selah)"
Tehillim,77,17,"The water saw you, God;
the water saw you and writhed in anguish,
agitated to its depths."
Tehillim,77,18,"The clouds poured water, the skies thundered,
and your arrows flashed here and there."
Tehillim,77,19,"The sound of your thunder was in the whirlwind,
the lightning flashes lit up the world,
the earth trembled and shook."
Tehillim,77,20,"Your way went through the sea,
your path through the turbulent waters;
but your footsteps could not be traced."
Tehillim,77,21,"You led your people like a flock
under the care of Moshe and Aharon."

Listen, my people, to my teaching;
turn your ears to the words from my mouth."

and explain mysteries from days of old."
Tehillim,78,3,"The things which we have heard and known,
and which our fathers told us"
Tehillim,78,4,"we will not hide from their descendants;
we will tell the generation to come
the praises of ADONAI and his strength,
the wonders that he has performed."
Tehillim,78,5,"He raised up a testimony in Ya‘akov
and established a Torah in Isra’el.
He commanded our ancestors
to make this known to their children"
Tehillim,78,6,"so that the next generation would know it,
the children not yet born,
who would themselves arise
and tell their own children"
Tehillim,78,7,"who could then put their confidence in God,
not forgetting God’s deeds,
but obeying his mitzvot."
Tehillim,78,8,"Then they would not be like their ancestors,
a stubborn, rebellious generation,
a generation with unprepared hearts,
with spirits unfaithful to God."
Tehillim,78,9,"The people of Efrayim, though armed with bows and arrows,
turned their backs on the day of battle."
Tehillim,78,10,"They did not keep the covenant of God
and refused to live by his Torah."
Tehillim,78,11,"They forgot what he had done,
his wonders which he had shown them."
Tehillim,78,12,"He had done wonderful things
in the presence of their ancestors
in the land of Egypt,
in the region of Tzo‘an."
Tehillim,78,13,"He split the sea and made them pass through,
he made the waters stand up like a wall."
Tehillim,78,14,"He also led them by day with a cloud
and all night long with light from a fire."
Tehillim,78,15,"He broke apart the rocks in the desert
and let them drink as if from boundless depths"
Tehillim,78,16,"yes, he brought streams out of the rock,
making the water flow down like rivers."
Tehillim,78,17,"Yet they sinned still more against him,
rebelling in the wilderness against the Most High"
Tehillim,78,18,"in their hearts they tested God
by demanding food that would satisfy their cravings."
Tehillim,78,19,"Yes, they spoke against God by asking,
“Can God spread a table in the desert?"
Tehillim,78,20,"True, he struck the rock, and water gushed out,
until the vadis overflowed;
but what about bread? Can he give that?
Can he provide meat for his people?”"
Tehillim,78,21,"Therefore, when ADONAI heard, he was angry;
fire blazed up against Ya‘akov;
his anger mounted against Isra’el"
Tehillim,78,22,"because they had no faith in God,
no trust in his power to save."
Tehillim,78,23,"So he commanded the skies above
and opened the doors of heaven."
Tehillim,78,24,"He rained down man on them as food;
he gave them grain from heaven "
Tehillim,78,25,"mortals ate the bread of angels;
he provided for them to the full."
Tehillim,78,26,"He stirred up the east wind in heaven,
brought on the south wind by his power"
Tehillim,78,27,"and rained down meat on them like dust,
birds flying thick as the sand on the seashore."
Tehillim,78,28,"He let them fall in the middle of their camp,
all around their tents."
Tehillim,78,29,"So they ate till they were satisfied;
he gave them what they craved."
Tehillim,78,30,"They were still fulfilling their craving,
the food was still in their mouths"
Tehillim,78,31,"when the anger of God rose up against them
and slaughtered their strongest men,
laying low the young men of Isra’el."
Tehillim,78,32,"Still, they kept on sinning
and put no faith in his wonders."
Tehillim,78,33,"Therefore, he ended their days in futility
and their years in terror."
Tehillim,78,34,"When he brought death among them, they would seek him;
they would repent and seek God eagerly"
Tehillim,78,35,"remembering that God was their Rock,
El ‘Elyon their Redeemer."
Tehillim,78,36,"But they tried to deceive him with their words,
they lied to him with their tongues"
Tehillim,78,37,"for their hearts were not right with him,
and they were unfaithful to his covenant."
Tehillim,78,38,"Yet he, because he is full of compassion,
forgave their sin and did not destroy;
many times he turned away his anger
and didn’t rouse all his wrath."
Tehillim,78,39,"So he remembered that they were but flesh,
a wind that blows past and does not return."
Tehillim,78,40,"How often they rebelled against him in the desert
and grieved him in the wastelands!"
Tehillim,78,41,"Repeatedly they challenged God
and pained the Holy One of Isra’el."
Tehillim,78,42,"They didn’t remember how he used his hand
on the day he redeemed them from their enemy"
Tehillim,78,43,"how he displayed his signs in Egypt,
his wonders in the region of Tzo‘an."
Tehillim,78,44,"He turned their rivers into blood,
so they couldn’t drink from their streams."
Tehillim,78,45,"He sent swarms of flies, which devoured them,
and frogs, which destroyed them."
Tehillim,78,46,"He gave their harvest to shearer-worms,
the fruit of their labor to locusts."
Tehillim,78,47,"He destroyed their vineyards with hail
and their sycamore-figs with frost."
Tehillim,78,48,"Their cattle too he gave over to the hail
and their flocks to lightning bolts."
Tehillim,78,49,"He sent over them his fierce anger,
fury, indignation and trouble,
with a company of destroying angels"
Tehillim,78,50,"to clear a path for his wrath.
He did not spare them from death,
but gave them over to the plague"
Tehillim,78,51,"striking all the firstborn in Egypt,
the firstfruits of their strength in the tents of Ham."
Tehillim,78,52,"But his own people he led out like sheep,
guiding them like a flock in the desert."
Tehillim,78,53,"He led them safely, and they weren’t afraid,
even when the sea overwhelmed their foes."
Tehillim,78,54,"He brought them to his holy land,
to the hill-country won by his right hand."
Tehillim,78,55,"He expelled nations before them,
apportioned them property to inherit
and made Isra’el’s tribes live in their tents."
Tehillim,78,56,"Yet they tested El ‘Elyon
and rebelled against him,
refusing to obey his instructions."
Tehillim,78,57,"They turned away and were faithless, like their fathers;
they were unreliable, like a bow without tension."
Tehillim,78,58,"They provoked him with their high places
and made him jealous with their idols."
Tehillim,78,59,"God heard, and he was angry;
he came to detest Isra’el completely."
Tehillim,78,60,"He abandoned the tabernacle at Shiloh,
the tent he had made where he could live among people."
Tehillim,78,61,"He gave his strength into exile,
his pride to the power of the foe."
Tehillim,78,62,"He gave his people over to the sword
and grew angry with his own heritage."
Tehillim,78,63,"Fire consumed their young men,
their virgins had no wedding-song"
Tehillim,78,64,"their cohanim fell by the sword,
and their widows could not weep."
Tehillim,78,65,"Then Adonai awoke, as if from sleep,
like a warrior shouting for joy from wine."
Tehillim,78,66,"He struck his foes, driving them back
and putting them to perpetual shame."
Tehillim,78,67,"Rejecting the tents of Yosef
and passing over the tribe of Efrayim"
Tehillim,78,68,"he chose the tribe of Y’hudah,
Mount Tziyon, which he loved."
Tehillim,78,69,"He built his sanctuary like the heights;
like the earth, he made it to last forever."
Tehillim,78,70,"He chose David to be his servant,
taking him from the sheep-yards"
Tehillim,78,71,"from tending nursing ewes he brought him
to shepherd Ya‘akov his people,
Isra’el his heritage."
Tehillim,78,72,"With upright heart he shepherded them
and guided them with skillful hands."
Tehillim,79,1,"A psalm of Asaf:
God, the pagans have entered your heritage.
They have defiled your holy temple
and turned Yerushalayim into rubble."
Tehillim,79,2,"They have given the corpses of your servants
as food for the birds in the air,
yes, the flesh of those faithful to you
for the wild animals of the earth."
Tehillim,79,3,"All around Yerushalayim
they have shed their blood like water,
and no one is left to bury them."
Tehillim,79,4,"We suffer the taunts of our neighbors,
we are mocked and scorned by those around us."
Tehillim,79,5,"How long, ADONAI?
Will you be angry forever?
How long will your jealousy burn like fire?"
Tehillim,79,6,"Pour out your wrath on the nations that don’t know you,
on the kingdoms that don’t call out your name"
Tehillim,79,7,"for they have devoured Ya‘akov
and left his home a waste."
Tehillim,79,8,"Don’t count past iniquities against us,
but let your compassion come quickly to meet us,
for we have been brought very low."
Tehillim,79,9,"Help us, God of our salvation,
for the sake of the glory of your name.
Deliver us, forgive our sins,
for your name’s sake."
Tehillim,79,10,"Why should the nations ask,
“Where is their God?”
Let the vengeance taken on your servants’ shed blood
be known among the nations before our eyes."
Tehillim,79,11,"Let the groaning of the captives come before you;
by your great strength save those condemned to death."

for the insults they inflicted on you, Adonai."

and our enemies mock us."

Make your face shine, and we will be saved."
Tehillim,80,9,"You brought a vine out of Egypt,
you expelled the nations and planted it"

then it took root firmly and filled the land."

the mighty cedars with its branches"
Tehillim,80,12,"It put out branches as far as the sea
and shoots to the [Euphrates] River."
Tehillim,80,13,"Why did you break down [the vineyard’s] wall,
so that all passing by can pluck [its fruit]?"

wild creatures from the fields feed on it."
Tehillim,80,15,"God of armies, please come back!
Look from heaven, see, and tend this vine!"

when he went out against the land of Egypt.
I heard an unfamiliar voice say"

his hands were freed from the [laborer’s] basket."

Open your mouth, and I will fill it.’"

Sing a new song to ADONAI,
because he has done wonders.
His right hand, his holy arm
have won him victory."
Tehillim,98,2,"ADONAI has made known his victory;
revealed his vindication in full view of the nations"
Tehillim,98,3,"remembered his grace and faithfulness
to the house of Isra’el.
All the ends of the earth have seen
the victory of our God."

Break forth, sing for joy, sing praises!"

shout for joy before the king, ADONAI!"

the world, and those living in it."
Tehillim,98,8,"Let the floods clap their hands;
let the mountains sing together for joy"
Tehillim,98,9,"before ADONAI, for he has come to judge the earth;
he will judge the world rightly and the peoples fairly."
Tehillim,99,1,"ADONAI is king; let the peoples tremble.
He sits enthroned on the k’ruvim; let the earth shake!"

he is high above all the peoples."

fairness, justice and righteousness in Ya‘akov.”"
Tehillim,99,5,"Exalt ADONAI our God!
Prostrate yourselves at his footstool (he is holy)."
Tehillim,99,6,"Moshe and Aharon among his cohanim
and Sh’mu’el among those who call on his name
called on ADONAI, and he answered them."
Tehillim,99,7,"He spoke to them in the column of cloud;
they kept his instructions and the law that he gave them."
Tehillim,99,8,"ADONAI our God, you answered them.
To them you were a forgiving God,
although you took vengeance on their wrongdoings."
Tehillim,99,9,"Exalt ADONAI our God,
bow down toward his holy mountain,
for ADONAI our God is holy!"

it is he who made us; and we are his,
his people, the flock in his pasture."
Tehillim,100,4,"Enter his gates with thanksgiving,
enter his courtyards with praise;
give thanks to him, and bless his name."
Tehillim,100,5,"For ADONAI is good, his grace continues forever,
and his faithfulness lasts through all generations."
Tehillim,101,1,"A psalm of David:
I am singing of grace and justice;
I am singing to you, ADONAI."
Tehillim,101,2,"I will follow the path of integrity;
when will you come to me?
I will run my life with a sincere heart
inside my own house."
Tehillim,101,3,"I will not allow before my eyes
any shameful thing.
I hate those who act crookedly;
what they do does not attract me."
Tehillim,101,4,"Deviousness will depart from me;
I will not tolerate evil."
Tehillim,101,5,"If someone slanders another in secret,
I will cut him off.
Haughty eyes and proud hearts
I cannot abide."

can be servants of mine."

no liar can be my advisor."
Tehillim,101,8,"Every morning I will destroy
all the wicked of the land,
cutting off all evildoers
from the city of ADONAI."
Tehillim,102,1,Prayer of a sufferer overcome by weakness and pouring out his complaint before ADONAI
Tehillim,102,2,"ADONAI, hear my prayer!
Let my cry for help reach you!"
Tehillim,102,3,"Don’t hide your face from me
when I am in such distress!
Turn your ear toward me;
when I call, be quick to reply!"
Tehillim,102,4,"For my days are vanishing like smoke,
my bones are burning like a furnace."
Tehillim,102,5,"I am stricken and withered like grass;
I forget to eat my food."
Tehillim,102,6,"Because of my loud groaning,
I am just skin and bones."
Tehillim,102,7,"I am like a great owl in the desert,
I’ve become like an owl in the ruins."
Tehillim,102,8,"I lie awake and become
like a bird alone on the roof."
Tehillim,102,9,"My enemies taunt me all day long;
mad with rage, they make my name a curse."
Tehillim,102,10,"For I have been eating ashes like bread
and mingling tears with my drink"
Tehillim,102,11,"because of your furious anger,
since you picked me up just to toss me aside."
Tehillim,102,12,"My days decline like an evening shadow;
I am drying up like grass."
Tehillim,102,13,"But you, ADONAI, are enthroned forever;
your renown will endure through all generations."
Tehillim,102,14,"You will arise and take pity on Tziyon,
for the time has come to have mercy on her;
the time determined has come."
Tehillim,102,15,"For your servants love her very stones;
they take pity even on her dust."
Tehillim,102,16,"The nations will fear the name of ADONAI
and all the kings on earth your glory"
Tehillim,102,17,"when ADONAI has rebuilt Tziyon,
and shows himself in his glory"
Tehillim,102,18,"when he has heeded the plea of the poor
and not despised their prayer."
Tehillim,102,19,"May this be put on record for a future generation;
may a people yet to be created praise ADONAI."
Tehillim,102,20,"For he has looked down from the height of his sanctuary;
from heaven ADONAI surveys the earth"
Tehillim,102,21,"to listen to the sighing of the prisoner,
to set free those who are sentenced to death"
Tehillim,102,22,"to proclaim the name of ADONAI in Tziyon
and his praise in Yerushalayim"
Tehillim,102,23,"when peoples and kingdoms have been gathered together
to serve ADONAI."
Tehillim,102,24,"He has broken my strength in midcourse,
he has cut short my days."
Tehillim,102,25,"I plead, “God, your years last through all generations;
so don’t take me away when my life is half over!"
Tehillim,102,26,"In the beginning, you laid the foundations of the earth;
heaven is the work of your hands."
Tehillim,102,27,"They will vanish, but you will remain;
like clothing, they will all grow old;
yes, you will change them like clothing,
and they will pass away."
Tehillim,102,28,"But you remain the same,
and your years will never end."
Tehillim,102,29,"The children of your servants will live securely
and their descendants be established in your presence.”"

Bless ADONAI, my soul!
Everything in me, bless his holy name!"

and forget none of his benefits!"
Tehillim,103,3,"He forgives all your offenses,
he heals all your diseases"
Tehillim,103,4,"he redeems your life from the pit,
he surrounds you with grace and compassion"
Tehillim,103,5,"he contents you with good as long as you live,
so that your youth is renewed like an eagle’s."
Tehillim,103,6,"ADONAI brings vindication and justice
to all who are oppressed."
Tehillim,103,7,"He made his ways known to Moshe,
his mighty deeds to the people of Isra’el."
Tehillim,103,8,"ADONAI is merciful and compassionate,
slow to anger and rich in grace."
Tehillim,103,9,"He will not always accuse,
he will not keep his anger forever."
Tehillim,103,10,"He has not treated us as our sins deserve
or paid us back for our offenses"
Tehillim,103,11,"because his mercy toward those who fear him
is as far above earth as heaven."
Tehillim,103,12,"He has removed our sins from us
as far as the east is from the west."
Tehillim,103,13,"Just as a father has compassion on his children,
ADONAI has compassion on those who fear him."
Tehillim,103,14,"For he understands how we are made,
he remembers that we are dust."
Tehillim,103,15,"Yes, a human being’s days are like grass,
he sprouts like a flower in the countryside "
Tehillim,103,16,"but when the wind sweeps over, it’s gone;
and its place knows it no more."
Tehillim,103,17,"But the mercy of ADONAI on those who fear him
is from eternity past to eternity future,
and his righteousness extends
to his children’s children"
Tehillim,103,18,"provided they keep his covenant
and remember to follow his precepts."
Tehillim,103,19,"ADONAI has established his throne in heaven;
his kingly power rules everything."
Tehillim,103,20,"Bless ADONAI, you angels of his,
you mighty warriors who obey his word,
who carry out his orders!"
Tehillim,103,21,"Bless ADONAI, all his troops,
who serve him and do what he wants!"
Tehillim,103,22,"Bless ADONAI, all his works,
in every place where he rules!
Bless ADONAI, my soul!"
Tehillim,104,1,"Bless ADONAI, my soul!
ADONAI, my God, you are very great;
you are clothed with glory and majesty"
Tehillim,104,2,"wrapped in light as with a robe.
You spread out the heavens like a curtain"
Tehillim,104,3,"you laid the beams of your palace on the water.
You make the clouds your chariot,
you ride on the wings of the wind."
Tehillim,104,4,"You make winds your messengers,
fiery flames your servants."
Tehillim,104,5,"You fixed the earth on its foundations,
never to be moved."
Tehillim,104,6,"You covered it with the deep like a garment;
the waters stood above the mountains."
Tehillim,104,7,"At your rebuke they fled;
at the sound of your thunder they rushed away"
Tehillim,104,8,"flowing over hills, pouring into valleys,
down to the place you had fixed for them."
Tehillim,104,9,"You determined a boundary they could not cross;
they were never to cover the earth again."
Tehillim,104,10,"You make springs gush forth in the vadis;
they flow between the hills"
Tehillim,104,11,"supplying water to all the wild animals;
the wild donkeys quench their thirst."
Tehillim,104,12,"On their banks the birds of the air build their nests;
among the branches they sing."
Tehillim,104,13,"You water the mountains from your palace;
the earth is satisfied with how you provide "
Tehillim,104,14,"You grow grass for the cattle;
and for people you grow the plants they need
to bring forth bread from the earth"
Tehillim,104,15,"wine that gladdens the human heart,
oil to make faces glow,
and food to sustain their strength."
Tehillim,104,16,"ADONAI’s trees are satisfied —
the cedars of the L’vanon, which he has planted."
Tehillim,104,17,"In them sparrows build their nests,
while storks live in the fir trees."
Tehillim,104,18,"For the wild goats there are the high mountains,
while the coneys find refuge in the rocks."
Tehillim,104,19,"You made the moon to mark the seasons,
and the sun knows when to set."
Tehillim,104,20,"You bring darkness, and it is night,
the time when all forest animals prowl."
Tehillim,104,21,"The young lions roar after their prey
and seek their food from God."
Tehillim,104,22,"The sun rises, they slink away
and lie down to rest in their dens"
Tehillim,104,23,"while people go out to their work,
laboring on till evening."
Tehillim,104,24,"What variety there is in your works, ADONAI!
How many [of them there are]!
In wisdom you have made them all;
the earth is full of your creations."
Tehillim,104,25,"Look at the sea, so great, so wide!
It teems with countless creatures,
living beings, both large and small."
Tehillim,104,26,"The ships are there, sailing to and fro;
Livyatan, which you formed to play there."
Tehillim,104,27,"All of them look to you
to give them their food when they need it."
Tehillim,104,28,"When you give it to them, they gather it;
when you open your hand, they are well satisfied."
Tehillim,104,29,"If you hide your face, they vanish;
if you hold back their breath, they perish
and return to their dust."
Tehillim,104,30,"If you send out your breath, they are created,
and you renew the face of the earth."
Tehillim,104,31,"May the glory of ADONAI last forever!
May ADONAI rejoice in his works!"
Tehillim,104,32,"When he looks at the earth, it trembles;
when he touches the mountains, they pour out smoke."
Tehillim,104,33,"I will sing to ADONAI as long as I live,
sing praise to my God all my life."
Tehillim,104,34,"May my musings be pleasing to him;
I will rejoice in ADONAI."
Tehillim,104,35,"May sinners vanish from the earth
and the wicked be no more!
Bless ADONAI, my soul!
Halleluyah!"
Tehillim,105,1,"Give thanks to ADONAI! Call on his name!
Make his deeds known among the peoples."
Tehillim,105,2,"Sing to him, sing praises to him,
talk about all his wonders."
Tehillim,105,3,"Glory in his holy name;
let those seeking ADONAI have joyful hearts."
Tehillim,105,4,"Seek ADONAI and his strength;
always seek his presence."
Tehillim,105,5,"Remember the wonders he has done,
his signs and his spoken rulings."
Tehillim,105,6,"You descendants of Avraham his servant,
you offspring of Ya‘akov, his chosen ones"
Tehillim,105,7,"he is ADONAI our God!
His rulings are everywhere on earth."
Tehillim,105,8,"He remembers his covenant forever,
the word he commanded to a thousand generations"
Tehillim,105,9,"the covenant he made with Avraham,
the oath he swore to Yitz’chak"
Tehillim,105,10,"and established as a law for Ya‘akov,
for Isra’el as an everlasting covenant"
Tehillim,105,11,"“To you I will give the land of Kena‘an
as your allotted heritage.”"
Tehillim,105,12,"When they were but few in number,
and not only few, but aliens there too"
Tehillim,105,13,"wandering from nation to nation,
from this kingdom to that people"
Tehillim,105,14,"he allowed no one to oppress them.
Yes, for their sakes he rebuked even kings"
Tehillim,105,15,"“Don’t touch my anointed ones
or do my prophets harm!”"
Tehillim,105,16,"He called down famine on the land,
broke off all their food supply"
Tehillim,105,17,"but sent a man ahead of them —
Yosef, who was sold as a slave."
Tehillim,105,18,"They shackled his feet with chains,
and they bound him in irons"
Tehillim,105,19,"until the time when his word proved true,
God’s utterance kept testing him."
Tehillim,105,20,"The king sent and had him released,
the ruler of peoples set him free"
Tehillim,105,21,"he made him lord of his household,
in charge of all he owned"
Tehillim,105,22,"correcting his officers as he saw fit
and teaching his counselors wisdom."
Tehillim,105,23,"Then Isra’el too came into Egypt,
Ya‘akov lived as an alien in the land of Ham."
Tehillim,105,24,"There God made his people very fruitful,
made them too numerous for their foes"
Tehillim,105,25,"whose hearts he turned to hate his people,
and treat his servants unfairly."
Tehillim,105,26,"He sent his servant Moshe
and Aharon, whom he had chosen."
Tehillim,105,27,"They worked his signs among them,
his wonders in the land of Ham."
Tehillim,105,28,"He sent darkness, and the land grew dark;
they did not defy his word."
Tehillim,105,29,"He turned their water into blood
and caused their fish to die."
Tehillim,105,30,"Their land swarmed with frogs,
even in the royal chambers."
Tehillim,105,31,"He spoke, and there came swarms of insects
and lice throughout their land."
Tehillim,105,32,"He gave them hail instead of rain,
with fiery [lightning] throughout their land."
Tehillim,105,33,"He struck their vines and fig trees,
shattering trees all over their country."
Tehillim,105,34,"He spoke, and locusts came,
also grasshoppers without number"
Tehillim,105,35,"they ate up everything green in their land,
devoured the fruit of their ground."
Tehillim,105,36,"He struck down all the firstborn in their land,
the firstfruits of all their strength."
Tehillim,105,37,"Then he led his people out,
laden with silver and gold;
among his tribes not one stumbled."
Tehillim,105,38,"Egypt was happy to have them leave,
because fear of [Isra’el] had seized them."
Tehillim,105,39,"He spread out a cloud to screen them off
and fire to give them light at night."
Tehillim,105,40,"When they asked, he brought them quails
and satisfied them with food from heaven."
Tehillim,105,41,"He split a rock, and water gushed out,
flowing as a river over the dry ground"
Tehillim,105,42,"for he remembered his holy promise
to his servant Avraham."
Tehillim,105,43,"He led out his people with joy,
his chosen ones with singing."
Tehillim,105,44,"Then he gave them the lands of the nations,
and they possessed what peoples had toiled to produce"
Tehillim,105,45,"in order to obey his laws
and follow his teachings.
Halleluyah!"
Tehillim,106,1,"Halleluyah!
Give thanks to ADONAI; for he is good,
for his grace continues forever."
Tehillim,106,2,"Who can express ADONAI’s mighty doings
or proclaim in full his praise?"
Tehillim,106,3,"How happy are those who act justly,
who always do what is right!"
Tehillim,106,4,"Remember me, ADONAI, when you show favor to your people,
keep me in mind when you save them"
Tehillim,106,5,"so I can see how well things are going
with those whom you have chosen,
so that I can rejoice in your nation’s joy,
and glory in your heritage."
Tehillim,106,6,"Together with our ancestors, we have sinned,
done wrong, acted wickedly."
Tehillim,106,7,"Our ancestors in Egypt failed to grasp
the meaning of your wonders.
They didn’t keep in mind your great deeds of grace
but rebelled at the sea, at the Sea of Suf."
Tehillim,106,8,"Yet he saved them for his own name’s sake,
to make known his mighty power."
Tehillim,106,9,"He rebuked the Sea of Suf, and it dried up;
he led them through its depths as through a desert."
Tehillim,106,10,"He saved them from hostile hands,
redeemed them from the power of the foe."
Tehillim,106,11,"The water closed over their adversaries;
not one of them was left."
Tehillim,106,12,"Then they believed his words,
and they sang his praise."
Tehillim,106,13,"But soon they forgot his deeds
and wouldn’t wait for his counsel."
Tehillim,106,14,"In the desert they gave way to insatiable greed;
in the wastelands they put God to the test."
Tehillim,106,15,"He gave them what they wanted
but sent meagerness into their souls."
Tehillim,106,16,"In the camp they were jealous of Moshe
and Aharon, ADONAI’s holy one."
Tehillim,106,17,"The earth opened up and swallowed Datan
and closed over Aviram’s allies."
Tehillim,106,18,"A fire blazed out against that group,
the flames consumed the wicked."
Tehillim,106,19,"In Horev they fashioned a calf,
they worshipped a cast metal image."
Tehillim,106,20,"Thus they exchanged their Glory
for the image of an ox that eats grass!"
Tehillim,106,21,"They forgot God, who had saved them,
who had done great things in Egypt"
Tehillim,106,22,"wonders in the land of Ham,
fearsome deeds by the Sea of Suf."
Tehillim,106,23,"Therefore he said that he would destroy them,
[and he would have,] had not Moshe his chosen one
stood before him in the breach
to turn back his destroying fury."
Tehillim,106,24,"Next, they rejected the beautiful land,
they didn’t trust his promise"
Tehillim,106,25,"and they complained in their tents,
they didn’t obey ADONAI."
Tehillim,106,26,"Therefore, raising his hand, he swore to them
that he would strike them down in the desert"
Tehillim,106,27,"and strike down their descendants among the nations,
dispersing them in foreign lands."
Tehillim,106,28,"Now they joined themselves to Ba‘al-P‘or
and ate meat sacrificed to dead things."
Tehillim,106,29,"Thus they provoked him to anger with their deeds,
so that a plague broke out among them."
Tehillim,106,30,"Then Pinchas stood up and executed judgment;
so the plague was checked."
Tehillim,106,31,"That was credited to him as righteousness,
through all generations forever."
Tehillim,106,32,"They angered him at the M’rivah Spring,
and Moshe suffered on their account"
Tehillim,106,33,"for when they embittered his spirit,
[Moshe] spoke up without thinking."
Tehillim,106,34,"They failed to destroy the peoples,
as ADONAI had ordered them to do"
Tehillim,106,35,"but mingled with the nations
and learned to follow their ways."
Tehillim,106,36,"They went on to serve their idols,
which became a snare for them."
Tehillim,106,37,"They even sacrificed their sons
and their daughters to demons."
Tehillim,106,38,"Yes, they shed innocent blood,
the blood of their own sons and daughters,
whom they sacrificed to Kena‘an’s false gods,
polluting the land with blood."
Tehillim,106,39,"Thus they were defiled by their deeds;
they prostituted themselves by their actions"
Tehillim,106,40,"For this ADONAI’s fury blazed up against his people,
and he detested his heritage."
Tehillim,106,41,"He handed them over to the power of the nations,
and those who hated them ruled over them."
Tehillim,106,42,"Their enemies oppressed them
and kept them in subjection to their power."
Tehillim,106,43,"Many times [God] rescued them,
but they kept making plans to rebel.
Thus they were brought low
by their own wrongdoing."
Tehillim,106,44,"Still he took pity on their distress
whenever he heard their cry."
Tehillim,106,45,"For their sakes he kept in mind his covenant
and in his limitless grace relented"
Tehillim,106,46,"causing them to be treated with compassion
by all who had taken them captive."
Tehillim,106,47,"Save us, ADONAI our God!
Gather us from among the nations,
so that we can thank your holy name
and glory in praising you."
Tehillim,106,48,"Blessed be ADONAI, the God of Isra’el,
from eternity past to eternity future.
Now let all the people say,
“Amen! Halleluyah!”"
Tehillim,107,1,"Give thanks to ADONAI; for he is good,
for his grace continues forever."
Tehillim,107,2,"Let those redeemed by ADONAI say it,
those he redeemed from the power of the foe."
Tehillim,107,3,"He gathered them from the lands,
from the east and from the west,
from the north and from the sea."
Tehillim,107,4,"They wandered in the desert, on paths through the wastes,
without finding any inhabited city."
Tehillim,107,5,"They were hungry and thirsty,
their life was ebbing away."
Tehillim,107,6,"In their trouble they cried to ADONAI,
and he rescued them from their distress."
Tehillim,107,7,"He led them by a direct path
to a city where they could live."
Tehillim,107,8,"Let them give thanks to ADONAI for his grace,
for his wonders bestowed on humanity!"
Tehillim,107,9,"For he has satisfied the hungry,
filled the starving with good."
Tehillim,107,10,"Some lived in darkness, in death-dark gloom,
bound in misery and iron chains"
Tehillim,107,11,"because they defied God’s word,
scorned the counsel of the Most High."
Tehillim,107,12,"So he humbled their hearts by hard labor;
when they stumbled, no one came to their aid."
Tehillim,107,13,"In their trouble they cried to ADONAI,
and he rescued them from their distress."
Tehillim,107,14,"He led them from darkness, from death-dark gloom,
shattering their chains."
Tehillim,107,15,"Let them give thanks to ADONAI for his grace,
for his wonders bestowed on humanity!"
Tehillim,107,16,"For he shattered bronze doors
and cut through iron bars."
Tehillim,107,17,"There were foolish people who suffered affliction
because of their crimes and sins"
Tehillim,107,18,"they couldn’t stand to eat anything;
they were near the gates of death."
Tehillim,107,19,"In their trouble they cried to ADONAI,
and he rescued them from their distress"
Tehillim,107,20,"he sent his word and healed them,
he delivered them from destruction."
Tehillim,107,21,"Let them give thanks to ADONAI for his grace,
for his wonders bestowed on humanity!"
Tehillim,107,22,"Let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving
and proclaim his great deeds with songs of joy."
Tehillim,107,23,"Those who go down to the sea in ships,
plying their trade on the great ocean"
Tehillim,107,24,"saw the works of ADONAI,
his wonders in the deep."
Tehillim,107,25,"For at his word the storm-wind arose,
lifting up towering waves."
Tehillim,107,26,"The sailors were raised up to the sky,
then plunged into the depths.
At the danger, their courage failed them"
Tehillim,107,27,"they reeled and staggered like drunk men,
and all their skill was swallowed up."
Tehillim,107,28,"In their trouble they cried to ADONAI,
and he rescued them from their distress."
Tehillim,107,29,He silenced the storm and stilled its waves
Tehillim,107,30,"and they rejoiced as the sea grew calm.
Then he brought them safely
to their desired port."
Tehillim,107,31,"Let them give thanks to ADONAI for his grace,
for his wonders bestowed on humanity!"

and praise him in the leaders’ council."
Tehillim,107,33,"He turns rivers into desert,
flowing springs into thirsty ground"
Tehillim,107,34,"productive land into salt flats,
because the people living there are so wicked."
Tehillim,107,35,"But he also turns desert into pools of water,
dry land into flowing springs"
Tehillim,107,36,"there he gives the hungry a home,
and they build a city to live in"
Tehillim,107,37,"there they sow fields and plant vineyards,
which yield an abundant harvest."
Tehillim,107,38,"He blesses them, their numbers grow,
and he doesn’t let their livestock decrease."
Tehillim,107,39,"When their numbers fall, and they grow weak,
because of oppression, disaster and sorrow"
Tehillim,107,40,"he pours contempt on princes
and leaves them to wander in trackless wastes."
Tehillim,107,41,"But the needy he raises up from their distress
and increases their families like sheep."
Tehillim,107,42,"When the upright see this, they rejoice;
while the wicked are reduced to silence."
Tehillim,107,43,"Let whoever is wise observe these things
and consider ADONAI’s loving deeds."

May your glory be over all the earth"
Tehillim,108,7,"in order that those you love can be rescued;
so save with your right hand, and answer me!"

and I took joy [in his promise]:
“I will divide Sh’khem
and determine the shares in the Sukkot Valley."
Tehillim,108,9,"Gil‘ad is mine and M’nasheh mine,
Efrayim my helmet, Y’hudah my scepter."
Tehillim,108,10,"Mo’av is my washpot; on Edom I throw my shoe;
Over P’leshet I shout in triumph.”"
Tehillim,108,11,"Who will bring me into the fortified city?
Who will lead me to Edom?"
Tehillim,108,12,"God, have you rejected us?
You don’t go out with our armies, God."
Tehillim,108,13,"Help us against our enemy,
for human help is worthless."
Tehillim,108,14,"With God’s help we will fight valiantly,
for he will trample our enemies."
Tehillim,109,1,"For the leader. A psalm of David:
God, whom I praise, don’t remain silent!"

spoken against me with lying tongues"
Tehillim,109,3,"surrounded me with hateful words,
and attacked me without cause."
Tehillim,109,4,"In return for my love they became my accusers,
even though I prayed for them."
Tehillim,109,5,"They repay me evil for good
and hatred for my love."
Tehillim,109,6,"[They say,] “Appoint a wicked man over him,
may an accuser stand at his right."

may his name be erased within a generation."
Tehillim,109,14,"May the wrongs of his ancestors be remembered by ADONAI,
and may the sin of his mother not be erased"
Tehillim,109,15,"may they always be before ADONAI,
so he can cut off all memory of them from the earth."
Tehillim,109,16,"For he did not remember to show kindness
but hounded the downtrodden, the poor
and the brokenhearted to death."
Tehillim,109,17,"He loved cursing; may it recoil on him!
He didn’t like blessing; may it stay far from him!"
Tehillim,109,18,"He clothed himself with cursing
as routinely as with his coat;
May it enter inside him as easily as water,
as easily as oil into his bones."
Tehillim,109,19,"May it cling to him like the coat he wears,
like the belt he wraps around himself.”"
Tehillim,109,20,"This is what my adversaries want ADONAI to do,
those who speak evil against me."
Tehillim,109,21,"But you, God, ADONAI,
treat me as your name demands;
rescue me, because your grace is good."
Tehillim,109,22,"For I am poor and needy,
and my heart within me is wounded."
Tehillim,109,23,"Like a lengthening evening shadow, I am gone;
I am shaken off like a locust."
Tehillim,109,24,"My knees are weak from lack of food,
my flesh wastes away for lack of nourishment."
Tehillim,109,25,"I have become the object of their taunts;
when they see me, they shake their heads."

Save me, in keeping with your grace"

but to your name give glory,
because of your grace and truth."

made by human hands."

in the lands of the living."
Tehillim,116,10,"I will keep on trusting even when I say,
“I am utterly miserable,”"

“Everything human is deceptive.”"
Tehillim,116,12,"How can I repay ADONAI
for all his generous dealings with me?"
Tehillim,116,13,"I will raise the cup of salvation
and call on the name of ADONAI."
Tehillim,116,14,"I will pay my vows to ADONAI
in the presence of all his people."
Tehillim,116,15,"From ADONAI’s point of view,
the death of those faithful to him is costly."
Tehillim,116,16,"Oh, ADONAI! I am your slave;
I am your slave, the son of your slave-girl;
you have removed my fetters."
Tehillim,116,17,"I will offer a sacrifice of thanks to you
and will call on the name of ADONAI."
Tehillim,116,18,"I will pay my vows to ADONAI
in the presence of all his people"

“His grace continues forever.”"
Tehillim,118,5,"From my being hemmed in I called on Yah;
he answered and gave me more room."
Tehillim,118,6,"With ADONAI on my side, I fear nothing —
what can human beings do to me?"
Tehillim,118,7,"With ADONAI on my side as my help,
I will look with triumph at those who hate me."
Tehillim,118,8,"It is better to take refuge in ADONAI
than to trust in human beings"
Tehillim,118,9,"better to take refuge in ADONAI
than to put one’s trust in princes."
Tehillim,118,10,"The nations all surrounded me;
in the name of ADONAI I cut them down."
Tehillim,118,11,"They surrounded me on every side
in the name of ADONAI I cut them down."
Tehillim,118,12,"They surrounded me like bees
but were extinguished [as quickly] as a fire in thorns;
in the name of ADONAI I cut them down."

is heard in the tents of the righteous:
“ADONAI’s right hand struck powerfully!"

ADONAI’s right hand struck powerfully!”"
Tehillim,118,17,"I will not die; no, I will live
and proclaim the great deeds of Yah!"
Tehillim,118,18,"Yah disciplined me severely,
but did not hand me over to death."
Tehillim,118,19,"Open the gates of righteousness for me;
I will enter them and thank Yah."
Tehillim,118,20,"This is the gate of ADONAI;
the righteous can enter it."
Tehillim,118,21,"I am thanking you because you answered me;
you became my salvation."
Tehillim,118,22,"The very rock that the builders rejected
has become the cornerstone!"
