Nechemyah,1,1,"The words of Nechemyah the son of Hakhalyah:
It was in the month of Kislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the capital"
Nechemyah,1,2,"that Hanani, one of my kinsmen, came out of Y’hudah with some men; and I asked them about the remnant of Judeans who had escaped the exile, and about Yerushalayim."
Nechemyah,1,3,"They answered me, “The remnant of the exile left there in the province are in great distress and are held in contempt, the wall of Yerushalayim is in ruins, and its gates have been completely burned up.”"
Nechemyah,1,4,"On hearing this answer, I sat down and wept; I mourned for several days, fasting and praying before the God of heaven."
Nechemyah,1,5,"I said, “Please, ADONAI! God of heaven! You great and fearsome God, who keeps his covenant and extends grace to those who love him and observe his mitzvot!"
Nechemyah,1,6,"Let your ear now be attentive and your eyes be open, so that you will listen to the prayer of your servant, which I am praying before you these days, day and night, for the people of Isra’el your servants — even as I confess the sins of the people of Isra’el that we have committed against you. Yes, I and my father’s house have sinned."
Nechemyah,1,7,"We have deeply offended you. We haven’t observed the mitzvot, laws or rulings you ordered your servant Moshe."
Nechemyah,1,8,"Remember, please, the word you gave through your servant Moshe, ‘If you break faith, I will scatter you among the peoples"
Nechemyah,1,9,"but if you return to me, observe my mitzvot and obey them, then, even if your scattered ones are in the most distant part of heaven, nevertheless, I will collect them from there and bring them to the place I have chosen for bearing my name.’"
Nechemyah,1,10,"Now these are your servants, your people, whom you have redeemed by your great power and strong hand."
Nechemyah,1,11,"Adonai, please, let your ear now be attentive to the prayer of your servant and to the prayer of your servants who take joy in fearing your name: please let your servant succeed today and win this man’s compassion” — for I was the king’s personal attendant."
Nechemyah,2,1,"In the month of Nisan in the twentieth year of Artach’shashta the king, it happened that I took the wine and brought it to the king. Prior to then I had never appeared sad in his presence."
Nechemyah,2,2,"The king asked, “Why do you look so sad? You’re not sick, so this must be some deep inner grief.” At this, I became very fearful"
Nechemyah,2,3,"as I said to the king, “May the king live forever! Why shouldn’t I look sad, when the city, the place where my ancestors’ tombs are, lies in ruins; and its gates are completely burned up?”"
Nechemyah,2,4,"The king asked me, “What is it that you want?” I prayed to the God of heaven"
Nechemyah,2,5,"then said to the king, “If it pleases the king, if your servant has won your favor, send me to Y’hudah, to the city of my ancestors’ tombs, so that I can rebuild it.”"
Nechemyah,2,6,"With the queen sitting next to him, the king asked me, “How long is your trip going to take? When will you return?” So it pleased the king to send me, and I gave him a time."
Nechemyah,2,7,"I then said to the king, “If it pleases the king, have letters given to me for the governors of the territory beyond the [Euphrates] River, so that they will let me pass through until I reach Y’hudah"
Nechemyah,2,8,"and also a letter for Asaf the supervisor of the royal forests, so that he will give me timber to make beams for the gates of the fortress belonging to the house, for the city wall and for the house I will be occupying.” The king gave me these, according to the good hand of my God on me."
Nechemyah,2,9,I went to the governors of the territory beyond the River and gave them the king’s letters. The king had sent with me an escort of army captains and cavalry.
Nechemyah,2,10,"When Sanvalat the Horoni and Toviyah the servant, the ‘Amoni, heard about this, they were very displeased that someone had come to promote the welfare of the people of Isra’el."
Nechemyah,2,11,So I reached Yerushalayim. After I had been there for three days
Nechemyah,2,12,"I got up during the night, I and a few men with me. I hadn’t told anyone what my God had put in my heart to do for Yerushalayim; and I didn’t take any animal with me except the animal on which I was riding."
Nechemyah,2,13,"I went out by night through the Valley Gate, to the Dragon’s Well and the Dung Gate, and inspected the places where the walls of Yerushalayim were broken down and where its gates had been burned down."
Nechemyah,2,14,"Then I went on to the Fountain Gate and the King’s Pool, but there was no room for the animal under me to pass."
Nechemyah,2,15,"So I went up the valley in the dark and went on inspecting the wall; then I turned back, entered through the Valley Gate and returned"
Nechemyah,2,16,"without the officials’ knowing where I had gone or what I had done. Till then, I hadn’t said anything about this to the Judeans, cohanim, nobles, officials or anyone who would be responsible for the work."
Nechemyah,2,17,"Afterwards, I said to them, “You see what a sad state we are in, how Yerushalayim lies in ruins, with it gates burned up. Come, let’s rebuild the wall of Yerushalayim, so that we won’t continue in disgrace.”"
Nechemyah,2,18,"I also told them of the gracious hand of my God that had been on me, also what the king had said to me. They said, “Let’s start building at once,” and energetically set out to do this good work."
Nechemyah,2,19,"When Sanvalat the Horoni, Toviyah the servant, the ‘Amoni, and Geshem the Arab heard about it, they began mocking us and jeering, “What is this you are doing? Are you going to rebel against the king?”"
Nechemyah,2,20,"But I answered them: “The God of heaven will enable us to succeed. Therefore we his servants will set about rebuilding. But you have no share, right or history to commemorate in Yerushalayim.”"
Nechemyah,3,1,"Then Elyashiv the cohen hagadol set out with his fellow cohanim, and they rebuilt the Sheep Gate. They consecrated it and set up its doors; they consecrated it as far as the Tower of the Hundred and on to the Tower of Hanan’el."
Nechemyah,3,2,Next to him the men from Yericho built. Next to him Zakur the son of Imri built.
Nechemyah,3,3,"The sons of Hasna’ah rebuilt the Fish Gate; they installed its timber framework and set up its doors, along with its bolts and bars."
Nechemyah,3,4,"Next to them M’remot the son of Uriyah, the son of Hakotz, made repairs. Next to them Meshulam the son of Berekhyah, the son of Mesheizav’el, made repairs. Next to them Tzadok the son of Ba‘ana made repairs."
Nechemyah,3,5,Next to them the men from T’koa made repairs; but their nobles would not put their shoulders to the work of their Lord.
Nechemyah,3,6,"Yoyada the son of Paseach and Meshulam the son of B’sodyah made repairs to the Old City Gate; they installed its timber framework and set up its doors, along with its bolts and bars."
Nechemyah,3,7,"Next to them M’latyah the Giv‘oni, Yadon the Meronoti and the men from Giv‘on and Mitzpah made repairs; they worked for the people associated with the governor of the territory beyond the [Euphrates] River."
Nechemyah,3,8,"Next to them ‘Uzi’el the son of Harhayah, goldsmiths, made repairs.
Next to him Hananyah, one of the perfume-makers, made repairs; they renovated Yerushalayim as far as the Broad Wall."
Nechemyah,3,9,"Next to them Refayah the son of Hur, leader of half the district of Yerushalayim, made repairs."
Nechemyah,3,10,Next to him Y’dayah the son of Harumaf made repairs opposite his own house. Next to him Hatush the son of Hashavn’yah made repairs.
Nechemyah,3,11,Malkiyah the son of Harim and Hashuv the son of Pachat-Mo’av made repairs on another section and on the Tower of the Ovens.
Nechemyah,3,12,"Next to him Shalum the son of HaLochesh, leader of half the district of Yerushalayim, he and his daughters, made repairs."
Nechemyah,3,13,"Hanun and the people living in Zanoach repaired the Valley Gate; they rebuilt it and set up its doors, along with its bolts and bars; and they rebuilt 1,500 feet of the wall, as far as the Dung Gate."
Nechemyah,3,14,"Malkiyah the son of Rechav, leader of the district of Beit-Hakerem, repaired the Dung Gate; he rebuilt it and set up its doors, along with its bolts and bars."
Nechemyah,3,15,"Shalun the son of Kol-Hozeh, leader of the district of Mitzpah, repaired the Fountain Gate; he rebuilt it, covered it and set up its doors, along with its bolts and bars; he also rebuilt the wall of the Pool of Shelach, by the royal garden, as far as the stairs that go down from the City of David."
Nechemyah,3,16,"After him Nechemyah the son of Azbuk, leader of half the district of Beit-Tzur, made repairs from the place opposite the tombs of David as far as the artificial pool and the soldiers’ barracks."
Nechemyah,3,17,"After him the L’vi’im made repairs: Rechum the son of Bani; next to him Hashavyah, leader of half the district of Ke‘ilah, made repairs for his district."
Nechemyah,3,18,"After him their colleagues, Bavai the son of Henadad, leader of half the district of Ke‘ilah, made repairs."
Nechemyah,3,19,"Next to him ‘Ezer the son of Yeshua, leader of Mitzpah, made repairs on another section, opposite the ascent to the armory at the Angle."
Nechemyah,3,20,"After him Barukh the son of Zakkai worked diligently making repairs on another section, from the Angle to the door of the house of Elyashiv the cohen hagadol."
Nechemyah,3,21,"After him M’remot the son of Uriyah made repairs on another section, from the door of the house of Elyashiv to the end of the house of Elyashiv."
Nechemyah,3,22,After him the cohanim from the plain made repairs.
Nechemyah,3,23,"After them Binyamin and Hashuv made repairs opposite their house. After them ‘Azaryah the son of Ma‘aseiyah, the son of ‘Ananyah, made repairs next to his house."
Nechemyah,3,24,"After him Binui the son of Henadad repaired another section, from the house of ‘Azaryah to the Angle and to the Corner."
Nechemyah,3,25,"Palal the son of Uzai made repairs opposite the Angle and the tower that projects out from the upper part of the royal palace near the Courtyard of the Guard.
After him P’dayah the son of Par‘osh made repairs"
Nechemyah,3,26,(since the temple servants were living in the ‘Ofel) as far as opposite the Water Gate to the east and the tower that projects out.
Nechemyah,3,27,"After him the men from T’koa repaired another section, opposite the great tower that projects out and on to the wall of the ‘Ofel."
Nechemyah,3,28,"Above the Horse Gate the cohanim made repairs, each one opposite his own house."
Nechemyah,3,29,"After them Tzadok the son of Immer made repairs opposite his house. After him Sh’ma‘yah the son of Sh’khanyah, the keeper of the East Gate, made repairs."
Nechemyah,3,30,After him Hananyah the son of Shelemyah and Hanun the sixth son of Tzalaf made repairs on another section. After him Meshulam the son of Berekhyah made repairs opposite his own room.
Nechemyah,3,31,"After him Malkiyah, one of the goldsmiths, made repairs as far as the house of the temple servants and the merchants, opposite the Mustering Gate and on to the upper room at the corner."
Nechemyah,3,32,"Finally, between the upper room at the corner and the Sheep Gate the goldsmiths and merchants made repairs."
Nechemyah,3,33,"But when Sanvalat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, he was furious. Greatly enraged, he ridiculed the Judeans"
Nechemyah,3,34,"before his kinsmen and the army of Shomron he said, “What are these pathetic Judeans doing? Are they going to rebuild anything they want? Are they going to sacrifice? Are they going to finish today? Are they going to recover useful stones from the piles of rubble, burned rubble at that?”"
Nechemyah,3,35,"Toviyah the ‘Amoni was with him, and he said, “Whatever they’re building, why, if even a fox went up it, he’d knock their stone wall down!”"
Nechemyah,3,36,"Our God, listen! We are being treated with contempt. Turn back their jeers on their own heads; give them over to be plundered in a land of exile."
Nechemyah,3,37,"Don’t cover their guilt, don’t let their sin be wiped out from before you; because they have insulted the builders to their face."
Nechemyah,3,38,"So we kept building the wall, which was soon joined together and completed to half its height all the way around; because the people worked with a will."
Nechemyah,4,1,"But when Sanvalat, Toviyah, the Arabs, the ‘Amonim and the Ashdodim heard that the repairs on the walls of Yerushalayim were going forward, and the breaks were being filled in, they became very angry."
Nechemyah,4,2,All of them together plotted to come and fight against Yerushalayim and thus throw us into confusion.
Nechemyah,4,3,"However, we prayed to our God and, because of them, organized a watch against them day and night."
Nechemyah,4,4,"Y’hudah was saying, “The strength of the people who carry loads away is starting to fail, and there is so much rubble that we can’t build the wall.”"
Nechemyah,4,5,"Our enemies were saying, “They won’t know or see anything, until we have already infiltrated them and begun killing them and stopping the work.”"
Nechemyah,4,6,"And even the Judeans living near them came and must have said to us ten times, “From every place you must come back to us.”"
Nechemyah,4,7,"So in the lower parts of the space behind the wall, I stationed men according to their families, with their swords, spears and bows."
Nechemyah,4,8,"After inspecting them, I stood up and addressed the nobles, leaders and the rest of the people: “Don’t be afraid of them! Remember Adonai, who is great and fearful; and fight for your brothers, sons, daughters, wives and homes.”"
Nechemyah,4,9,"When our enemies heard that the plot was known to us, and God had foiled their plans, we all returned to the wall, everyone to his work."
Nechemyah,4,10,"From then on, half of my men would do the work; and half of them held the spears, shields, bows and armor; while the leaders stood guard behind the entire house of Y’hudah"
Nechemyah,4,11,as they continued building the wall. Those who carried loads held their loads with one hand and carried a weapon in the other.
Nechemyah,4,12,"As for the construction-workers, each one had his sword sheathed at his side; that is how they built. The man to sound the alarm on the shofar stayed with me."
Nechemyah,4,13,"I said to the nobles, the leaders and the rest of the people, “This is a great work, and it is spread out; we are separated on the wall, one far from another."
Nechemyah,4,14,"But wherever you are, when you hear the sound of the shofar, come to that place, to us. Our God will fight for us!”"
Nechemyah,4,15,So we kept doing the work. Half of them held spears from daybreak until the stars appeared.
Nechemyah,4,16,"Also at that time I told the people, “Let everyone with a servant stay the night within Yerushalayim, so that at night they can be a guard for us, even as they work during the day.”"
Nechemyah,4,17,"I, my kinsmen, my servants and my bodyguards never took off our clothes, and everyone who went to get water took his weapon."
Nechemyah,5,1,Then there arose a great outcry from the common people and their wives against their brothers the [wealthier] Judeans.
Nechemyah,5,2,"Some of them said, “Counting our sons and daughters, there are a lot of us! Allow us to get grain for them, so that we can eat and stay alive.”"
Nechemyah,5,3,"There were also some who said, “We are mortgaging our fields, vineyards and homes in order to buy grain, because of the famine.”"
Nechemyah,5,4,"Yet others said, “We have borrowed money for the king’s taxes against our fields and vineyards."
Nechemyah,5,5,"Now our flesh is no different from the flesh of our kinsmen, and our children are the same as their children; yet we are bringing our sons and daughters into bondage as slaves. Some of our daughters have gone into slavery already, and it’s beyond our power to do anything about it, because other men have our fields and vineyards.”"
Nechemyah,5,6,"When I heard their outcry and the reasons for it, I became very angry."
Nechemyah,5,7,"I thought the matter over and then took issue with the nobles and rulers. I charged them, “You are lending against pledges, everyone to his brother”; and I summoned a great assembly to deal with them."
Nechemyah,5,8,"I said to them, “We, to the limit of our ability, have redeemed our brothers the Judeans who sold themselves to the pagans. Now you are selling your own brothers, and we will have to buy them back!” They stayed silent; they couldn’t think of anything to say."
Nechemyah,5,9,"I also said, “What you are doing is not good! You should be living in fear of our God, so that our pagan enemies won’t have grounds for deriding us."
Nechemyah,5,10,"Moreover, my brothers and my servants, I too have loaned them money and grain. Please, let’s stop making it so burdensome to go into debt."
Nechemyah,5,11,"Please! Today! Give them back their fields, vineyards, olive groves and homes; also the hundred pieces of silver and the grain, wine and olive oil you demand from them as interest.”"
Nechemyah,5,12,"They answered, “We will give it back. We will require nothing from them. Yes, we will do it, just as you say.” Then I called the cohanim and took an oath from them that they would do as they had promised."
Nechemyah,5,13,"Shaking out the fold in my garment, I said, “May God thus shake every man from his house and from his work who fails to live up to this promise — may he be shaken out like this and made empty.” The whole assembly said, “Amen!” and praised ADONAI; and the people did as they had promised."
Nechemyah,5,14,"Besides that, from the time I was appointed their governor in the land of Y’hudah, from the twentieth year until the thirty-second year of Artach’shashta the king — that is, for twelve years — neither I nor my colleagues drew on the governor’s living allowance."
Nechemyah,5,15,"The earlier governors, before me, had burdened the people, taxing them more than one-and-a-half pounds of silver shekels for food and wine; and even their servants lorded it over the people. But I didn’t, because I feared God."
Nechemyah,5,16,"Moreover, I put all my energy into working on this wall. We didn’t buy any land, and all my servants were gathered there for the work."
Nechemyah,5,17,"There were 150 leaders and other Judeans who ate at my table, besides those who came to us from the surrounding nations."
Nechemyah,5,18,"Every day one ox, six choice sheep, and fowl were prepared for me, and every ten days a supply of all kinds of wine. Yet in spite of all this, I never claimed the governor’s allowance, because the people were already bearing the heavy burden of their labor."
Nechemyah,5,19,"My God, remember favorably everything I have done for this people!"
Nechemyah,6,1,"When it was reported to Sanvalat, Toviyah, Geshem the Arab and the rest of our enemies that I had rebuilt the wall and that not a single gap was left in it — although up to that time I hadn’t yet set up the doors in the gateways "
Nechemyah,6,2,"Sanvalat and Geshem sent me a message which said, “Come, let’s meet together in one of the villages of the Ono Valley.” But they were planning to do me harm"
Nechemyah,6,3,so I sent them messengers with this message: “I’m too busy with important work to come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it to come down to you?”
Nechemyah,6,4,They kept sending this sort of message to me — four times — and I answered them the same way.
Nechemyah,6,5,"The fifth time, with the same purpose, Sanvalat sent his servant to me with an open letter in his hand"
Nechemyah,6,6,"in which was written: “It is reported among the nations, and Geshem says it too, that you and the Judeans are planning a revolt, that this is why you are rebuilding the wall, and that you intend to be their king,” and similar words"
Nechemyah,6,7,"“moreover, that you have also appointed prophets to proclaim about you in Yerushalayim, ‘There is a king in Y’hudah!’ A report along these lines is now going to be made to the king. Come now, therefore, and let’s discuss this.”"
Nechemyah,6,8,I sent him this answer; “Nothing like what you are saying is being done. You’re making it all up in your head.”
Nechemyah,6,9,"They were all just trying to scare us, thinking, “This will sap their strength and keep them from working.” But now, [God,] increase my strength!"
Nechemyah,6,10,"One day, when I went to the house of Sh’ma‘yah the son of D’layah, the son of M’heitav’el, where he was confined, he said, “Let’s meet together in the house of God, inside the temple, and let’s shut the doors of the temple. For they are going to come and try to assassinate you; yes, they will come at night to kill you.”"
Nechemyah,6,11,"I replied, “Should a man like me run away? Can a man like me go into the temple to save his life? I refuse to go in.”"
Nechemyah,6,12,"Then I realized that God had not sent him, that he was making this prophecy against me, and that Toviyah and Sanvalat had bribed him to say it."
Nechemyah,6,13,"He had been hired to frighten me into following his suggestion and thus sin, so that they would have material for their unfavorable report about me and could taunt me with it."
Nechemyah,6,14,"My God, remember Toviyah and Sanvalat according to their deeds, also the prophet No‘adyah and the other prophets trying to intimidate me."
Nechemyah,6,15,"So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty-two days."
Nechemyah,6,16,"When all our enemies heard about it and the surrounding nations became afraid, our enemies’ self-esteem fell severely; because they realized that this work had been accomplished by our God."
Nechemyah,6,17,"During this same period of time, the nobles of Y’hudah sent many letters to Toviyah, and Toviyah kept sending them replies."
Nechemyah,6,18,"For there were many in Y’hudah who had sworn allegiance to him, because he was the son-in-law of Sh’khanyah the son of Arach, and his son Y’hochanan had taken as his wife the daughter of Meshulam the son of Berekhyah."
Nechemyah,6,19,"They would even praise his good deeds in my presence, and they passed on my words to him. And Toviyah kept sending letters to intimidate me."
Nechemyah,7,1,"After the wall had been rebuilt, and I had set up its doors, and the gatekeepers, singers and L’vi’im had been appointed"
Nechemyah,7,2,"I put my kinsman Hanani in charge of Yerushalayim, along with Hananyah the commander of the citadel. For he was a faithful man, and he feared God more than most."
Nechemyah,7,3,"I said to them, “The gates of Yerushalayim are not to be opened until the sun is hot; and while the gatekeepers are still on duty, have them shut the doors; and you, put up the bars. Appoint watchmen from among those living in Yerushalayim; assign each one his time to guard, and have each one serving near his own house.”"
Nechemyah,7,4,"The city was large and spacious, but there were few people in it, and the houses had not been rebuilt."
Nechemyah,7,5,"My God put it in my heart to assemble the nobles, the leaders and the people, so that they could be registered according to their genealogies. I located the record of the genealogies of those who had come up at the beginning and found written in it"
Nechemyah,7,6,"“Here is a list of the people of the province who had been exiled, carried off to Bavel by N’vukhadnetzar king of Bavel, but who later returned from exile and went up to Yerushalayim and Y’hudah, each to his own city"
Nechemyah,7,7,"they went with Z’rubavel, Yeshua, Nechemyah, ‘Azaryah, Ra‘amyah, Nachmani, Mordekhai, Bilshan, Misperet, Bigvai, N’chum and Ba‘anah.
“The number of men from the people of Isra’el"
Nechemyah,8,1,"all the people gathered with one accord in the open space in front of the Water Gate and asked ‘Ezra the Torah-teacher to bring the scroll of the Torah of Moshe, which ADONAI had commanded Isra’el."
Nechemyah,8,2,"‘Ezra the cohen brought the Torah before the assembly, which consisted of men, women and all children old enough to understand. It was the first day of the seventh month."
Nechemyah,8,3,"Facing the open space in front of the Water Gate, he read from it to the men, the women and the children who could understand from early morning until noon; and all the people listened attentively to the scroll of the Torah."
Nechemyah,8,4,"‘Ezra the Torah-teacher stood on a wood platform which they had made for the purpose; beside him on his right stood Mattityah, Shema, ‘Anayah, Uriyah, Hilkiyah and Ma‘aseiyah; while on his left were P’dayah, Misha’el, Malkiyah, Hashum, Hashbadanah, Z’kharyah and Meshulam."
Nechemyah,8,5,"‘Ezra opened the scroll where all the people could see him, because he was higher than all the people; when he opened it, all the people rose to their feet."
Nechemyah,8,6,"‘Ezra blessed ADONAI, the great God; and all the people answered, “Amen! Amen!” as they lifted up their hands, bowed their heads and fell prostrate before ADONAI with their faces to the ground."
Nechemyah,8,7,"The L’vi’im Yeshua, Bani, Sherevyah, Yamin, ‘Akuv, Shabtai, Hodiyah, Ma‘aseiyah, K’lita, ‘Azaryah, Yozavad, Hanan and P’layah explained the Torah to the people, while the people remained in their places."
Nechemyah,8,8,"They read clearly from the scroll, in the Torah of God, translated it, and enabled them to understand the sense of what was being read."
Nechemyah,8,9,"Nechemyah the Tirshata, ‘Ezra the cohen and Torah-teacher and the L’vi’im who taught the people said to all the people, “Today is consecrated to ADONAI your God; don’t be mournful, don’t weep.” For all the people had been weeping when they heard the words of the Torah."
Nechemyah,8,10,"Then he said to them, “Go, eat rich food, drink sweet drinks, and send portions to those who can’t provide for themselves; for today is consecrated to our Lord. Don’t be sad, because the joy of ADONAI is your strength.”"
Nechemyah,8,11,"In this way the L’vi’im quieted the people, as they said, “Be quiet, for today is holy; don’t be sad.”"
Nechemyah,8,12,"Then the people went off to eat, drink, send portions and celebrate; because they had understood the words that had been proclaimed to them."
Nechemyah,8,13,"On the second day, the heads of fathers’ clans of all the people assembled with the cohanim and L’vi’im before ‘Ezra the Torah-teacher to study the words of the Torah."
Nechemyah,8,14,They found written in the Torah that ADONAI had ordered through Moshe that the people of Isra’el were to live in sukkot during the feast of the seventh month
Nechemyah,8,15,"and that they were to announce and pass the word in all their cities and in Yerushalayim, “Go out to the mountains, and collect branches of olives, wild olives, myrtles, palms, and other leafy trees to make sukkot, as prescribed.”"
Nechemyah,8,16,"So the people went out, brought them and made sukkot for themselves, each one on the roof of his house, also in their courtyards, in the courtyards of the house of God, in the open space by the Water Gate and in the open space by the Efrayim Gate."
Nechemyah,8,17,"The entire community of those who had returned from the exile made sukkot and lived in the sukkot, for the people of Isra’el had not done this since the days of Yeshua the son of Nun. So there was very great joy."
Nechemyah,8,18,"Also they read every day, from the first day until the last day, in the scroll of the Torah of God. They kept the feast for seven days; then on the eighth day there was a solemn assembly, according to the rule."
Nechemyah,9,1,"On the twenty-fourth day of this month the people of Isra’el, wearing sackcloth and with dirt on them, assembled for a fast."
Nechemyah,9,2,Those descended from Isra’el separated themselves from all foreigners; then they stood up and confessed their own sins and the iniquities of their ancestors.
Nechemyah,9,3,"Standing where they were, they read in the scroll of the Torah of ADONAI their God for one-quarter of the day. For another quarter they confessed and prostrated themselves before ADONAI their God."
Nechemyah,9,4,"On the platform of the L’vi’im stood Yeshua, Bani, Kadmi’el, Sh’vanyah, Buni, Sherevyah, Bani and K’nani; they cried out loudly to ADONAI their God."
Nechemyah,9,5,"Then the L’vi’im Yeshua, Kadmi’el, Bani, Hashavn’yah, Sherevyah, Hodiyah, Sh’vanyah and P’tachyah said, “Stand up, and bless ADONAI your God from everlasting to everlasting; let them say:
“‘Blessed be your glorious name,
exalted above all blessing and praise!"
Nechemyah,9,6,"“‘You are ADONAI, you alone.
You made heaven,
the heaven of heavens, with all their array,
the earth and all the things that are in it,
the seas and all that is in them;
and you preserve them all.
The army of heaven worships you."
Nechemyah,9,7,"“‘You are ADONAI, the God who chose Avram,
brought him out of Ur-Kasdim
and gave him the name of Avraham."
Nechemyah,9,8,"Finding that he was faithful to you,
you made a covenant with him
to give the land of the Kena‘ani,
the Hitti, Emori and P’rizi,
the Y’vusi and the Girgashi,
to give it to his descendants;
and you have done what you promised,
because you are just."
Nechemyah,9,9,"“‘You saw the distress of our ancestors in Egypt
and heard their cry by the Sea of Suf."
Nechemyah,9,10,"You performed signs and wonders against Pharaoh,
against all his servants and the people of the land;
for you knew how arrogantly they treated them;
and you won yourself a name which is yours to this day."
Nechemyah,9,11,"You divided the sea ahead of them,
so that they could pass through the sea on dry land;
then you hurled their pursuers into the depths,
like a stone into turbulent waters."
Nechemyah,9,12,"“‘In a column of cloud you led them by day,
and by night in a column of fire,
so that they would have light ahead of them
on the way that they were to go."
Nechemyah,9,13,"“‘You descended on Mount Sinai
and spoke with them from heaven.
You gave them right rulings and true teachings,
good laws and mitzvot."
Nechemyah,9,14,"You revealed to them your holy Shabbat
and gave them mitzvot, laws and the Torah
through Moshe your servant."
Nechemyah,9,15,"“‘For their hunger you gave them bread from heaven;
for their thirst you brought forth for them water from the rock.
You ordered them to enter and possess the land
you had sworn with your hand to give them."
Nechemyah,9,16,"“‘But they and our ancestors were arrogant;
they stiffened their necks and ignored your mitzvot"
Nechemyah,9,17,"they refused to listen and paid no attention
to the wonders you had done among them.
No, they stiffened their necks, and in their rebellion
appointed a leader to return them to their slavery.
But because you are a God of forgiveness,
merciful, full of compassion,
slow to grow angry and full of grace,
you did not abandon them."
Nechemyah,9,18,"Even when they cast themselves a metal calf,
saying of it, “This is your god
that brought you up from Egypt,”
and committing other gross provocations"
Nechemyah,9,19,"still, you, in your great compassion,
did not abandon them in the desert.
The column of cloud did not leave them by day;
it kept leading them along the way.
By night the column of fire
kept showing them light and the path to take."
Nechemyah,9,20,"You also gave your good Spirit to teach them,
did not withhold man from their mouths
and provided them water to quench their thirst."
Nechemyah,9,21,"Yes, forty years you sustained them in the desert;
they lacked nothing —
their clothes did not wear out;
their feet did not swell up."
Nechemyah,9,22,"“‘You gave them kingdoms and peoples;
you even gave them extra land,
so that they took possession of the land of Sichon,
also the land of the king of Heshbon
and the land of ‘Og king of Bashan."
Nechemyah,9,23,"You made their children as numerous
as the countless stars in the sky.
“‘Then you brought them into the land
about which you had said to their fathers
that they should go in and take possession of it."
Nechemyah,9,24,"So the children went in and possessed the land,
as you subdued ahead of them
the Kena‘ani living in the land,
and handed them over to them,
along with their kings and the peoples of the land,
for them to do with as they wished."
Nechemyah,9,25,"They took fortified cities and fertile land,
possessed houses full of all kinds of good things,
dug-out cisterns, vineyards, olive groves,
fruit trees in plenty;
so they ate their fill and grew robust,
luxuriating in your great goodness."
Nechemyah,9,26,"“‘Yet they disobeyed and rebelled against you,
throwing your Torah behind their backs.
They killed your prophets for warning them
that they should return to you
and committed other gross provocations."
Nechemyah,9,27,"So you handed them over to the power
of their adversaries, who oppressed them.
Yet in the time of their trouble,
when they cried out to you,
you heard from heaven, and in keeping
with your great compassion,
you gave them saviors to save them
from the power of their adversaries."
Nechemyah,9,28,"But as soon as they had gotten some relief,
they went back to do evil before you.
So you left them in the power of their enemies,
who came down hard on them.
Yet when they returned and cried out to you,
you heard from heaven many times
and saved them, according to your compassion."
Nechemyah,9,29,"You warned them, in order to bring them back
to your Torah; yet they were arrogant.
They paid no attention to your mitzvot,
but sinned against your rulings,
which, if a person does them,
he will have life through them.
However, they stubbornly turned their shoulders,
stiffened their necks and refused to hear."
Nechemyah,9,30,"Many years you extended them mercy
and warned them by your Spirit through your prophets;
yet they would not listen.
Therefore you handed them over
to the peoples of the lands."
Nechemyah,9,31,"Even so, in your great compassion,
you didn’t completely destroy them;
nor did you abandon them,
for you are a compassionate and merciful God."
Nechemyah,9,32,"“‘Now therefore, our God,
great, mighty, fearsome God,
who keeps both covenant and grace:
let not all this suffering seem little to you
that has come on us, our kings, our leaders,
our cohanim, our prophets, our ancestors,
and on all your people,
from the times of the kings of Ashur
until this very day."
Nechemyah,9,33,"There is no question that you are just
in all that has come upon us;
for you have treated us fairly.
It is we who have acted wickedly."
Nechemyah,9,34,"Our kings, our leaders, our cohanim and ancestors
did not keep your Torah,
pay attention to your mitzvot
or heed the warnings you gave them."
Nechemyah,9,35,"Even when they ruled their own kingdom,
even when you prospered them greatly,
in the great, rich land you gave them,
they did not serve you;
nor did they turn from their wicked deeds."
Nechemyah,9,36,"“‘So here we are today, slaves.
Yes, in the land you gave our ancestors,
so that they could eat what it produces
and enjoy its good —
here we are in it, slaves!"
Nechemyah,9,37,"Its rich yield now goes to the kings
you have set over us because of our sins;
they have power over our bodies,
they can do what they please to our livestock,
and we are in great distress!"
Nechemyah,10,1,"“‘In view of all this, we are making a binding covenant, putting it in writing and having it sealed by our leaders, our L’vi’im and our cohanim.’”"
Nechemyah,10,2,"On the sealed document were the names of: Nechemyah the Tirshata the son of Hakhalyah, Tzedekyah"

Nechemyah,10,30,"joined their kinsmen and their leaders in swearing an oath, accompanied by a curse [in case of noncompliance], as follows:
“We will live by God’s Torah, given by Moshe the servant of God, and will perform and obey all the mitzvot, rulings and laws of ADONAI our Lord."
Nechemyah,10,31,“We will not give our daughters as wives to the peoples of the land or take their daughters as wives for our sons.
Nechemyah,10,32,"“If the peoples of the lands bring merchandise or food to sell on Shabbat, we will not buy from them on Shabbat or on a holy day.
“We will forego [planting and harvesting our fields] during the seventh year and collecting debts then."

Nechemyah,10,34,"for the showbread, for the regular grain offering, for the regular burnt offering, for [the offerings] on Shabbat, on Rosh-Hodesh, at the designated times and at other holy times, for the sin offerings to make atonement for Isra’el, and for all the work connected with the house of our God."
Nechemyah,10,35,"“We, the cohanim, the L’vi’im and the people, will cast lots in connection with the wood offering, so that it will be brought to the house of our God according to our fathers’ clans, at specified times, year by year, and then be burned on the altar of ADONAI our God, as prescribed in the Torah."
Nechemyah,10,36,“Every year we will bring the firstfruits of our land and the firstfruits of all fruit from every kind of tree to the house of ADONAI.
Nechemyah,10,37,"“We will also bring the firstborn of our sons and of our livestock, as prescribed in the Torah, and the firstborn of our herds and flocks, to the house of our God, to the cohanim ministering in the house of our God."

Nechemyah,10,39,"The cohen the descendant of Aharon is to be with the L’vi’im when the L’vi’im take tenths. The L’vi’im will bring the tenth of the tenth to the house of our God, to the storerooms for supplies."
Nechemyah,10,40,"For the people of Isra’el and the descendants of Levi are to bring the contribution of grain, wine and olive oil to the rooms where the equipment for the sanctuary, the ministering cohanim, the gatekeepers and the singers are. We will not abandon the house of our God.”"
Nechemyah,11,1,"The leaders of the people took up residence in Yerushalayim; while the rest of the people cast lots to bring one-tenth of them to live in Yerushalayim the holy city, with the other nine-tenths in the other cities."
Nechemyah,11,2,The people blessed all those who volunteered to live in Yerushalayim.
Nechemyah,11,3,"In the cities of Y’hudah, everyone lived on his own property — the people of Isra’el, the cohanim, the L’vi’im, the temple servants and the descendants of Shlomo’s servants. But the leaders of the province lived in Yerushalayim."
Nechemyah,11,4,"Some of those living in Yerushalayim were from people of Y’hudah, and others were from people of Binyamin. Those from the people of Y’hudah were: ‘Atayah the son of ‘Uziyah, the son of Z’kharyah, the son of Amaryah, the son of Sh’fatyah, the son of Mahalal’el, from the descendants of Peretz"

Nechemyah,11,19,"The gatekeepers: ‘Akuv, Talmon and their kinsmen, who kept watch at the gates, numbered 172."
Nechemyah,11,20,"The rest of Isra’el, [the rest of] the cohanim and [the rest of] the L’vi’im were in all the cities of Y’hudah, each on his own property."
Nechemyah,11,21,The temple servants lived in the ‘Ofel; Tzicha and Gishpa were in charge of the temple servants.
Nechemyah,11,22,"The overseer of the L’vi’im in Yerushalayim was ‘Uzi the son of Bani, the son of Hashavyah, the son of Matanyah, the son of Mikha, from the descendants of Asaf the singers; [he was] in charge of the work of the house of God."
Nechemyah,11,23,"For they were subject to the king’s orders; and there was a fixed schedule for the singers, assigning them their daily duties."
Nechemyah,11,24,"P’tachyah the son of Mesheizav’el, from the descendants of Zerach the son of Y’hudah, was the king’s deputy in all affairs concerning the people."
Nechemyah,11,25,"As for the villages and their surrounding fields: some of the people of Y’hudah lived in Kiryat-Arba and its villages, in Divon and its villages, in Y’kabze’el and its villages"
Nechemyah,11,26,"in Yeshua, in Moladah, in Beit-Pelet"

Nechemyah,12,8,"The L’vi’im: Yeshua, Binui, Kadmi’el, Sherevyah, Y’hudah and Mattanyah, who was in charge of the songs of thanksgiving, he and his kinsmen"
Nechemyah,12,9,"with Bakbukyah and ‘Uni, their kinsmen, singing antiphonally with them in the service."
Nechemyah,12,10,"Yeshua was the father of Yoyakim, Yoyakim was the father of Elyashiv, Elyashiv was the father of Yoyada"
Nechemyah,12,11,"Yoyada was the father of Yonatan, and Yonatan was the father of Yadua."
Nechemyah,12,12,"In the days of Yoyakim these were the cohanim who were heads of fathers’ clans: of S’rayah, M’rayah; of Yirmeyah, Hananyah"

Nechemyah,12,22,"As for the L’vi’im, the heads of fathers’ clans in the days of Elyashiv, Yoyada, Yochanan and Yadua were recorded; also the cohanim, up to the reign of Daryavesh the Persian."
Nechemyah,12,23,The descendants of Levi who were heads of fathers’ clans were recorded in the annals until the days of Yochanan the [grand]son of Elyashiv.
Nechemyah,12,24,"The chiefs of the L’vi’im were Hashavyah, Sherevyah and Yeshua the son of Kadmi’el, with their kinsmen in an antiphonal choir, to praise and give thanks, in accordance with the order of David the man of God, choir opposite choir."
Nechemyah,12,25,"Mattanyah, Bakbukyah, ‘Ovadyah, Meshulam, Talmon and ‘Akuv were the gatekeepers who guarded the supplies kept at the gates."
Nechemyah,12,26,"This was in the days of Yoyakim the son of Yeshua, the son of Yotzadak, and in the days of Nechemyah the governor and of ‘Ezra the cohen and Torah-teacher."
Nechemyah,12,27,"At the dedication of the wall of Yerushalayim, they sought out the L’vi’im from wherever they had settled to bring them to Yerushalayim and celebrate the dedication with hymns of thanksgiving and with songs accompanied by cymbals, lutes and lyres."
Nechemyah,12,28,"The trained singers assembled together from the area around Yerushalayim, the villages of the N’tofati"
Nechemyah,12,29,Beit-Gilgal and the region of Geva and ‘Azmavet; for the singers had built villages for themselves all around Yerushalayim.
Nechemyah,12,30,"The cohanim and L’vi’im first purified themselves; then they purified the people, the gates and the wall"
Nechemyah,12,31,and after that I brought the leaders of Y’hudah up onto the wall and appointed two large choirs to give thanks and to walk in procession. One went to the right on the wall toward the Dung Gate.
Nechemyah,12,32,After them went Hosha‘yah and half of the leaders of Y’hudah
Nechemyah,12,33,"together with ‘Azaryah, ‘Ezra, Meshulam"
Nechemyah,12,34,"Y’hudah, Binyamin, Sh’ma‘yah and Yirmeyah."
Nechemyah,12,35,"With them were some of the sons of the cohanim carrying trumpets, namely, Z’kharyah the son of Yonatan the son of Sh’ma‘yah, the son of Mattanyah, the son of Mikhayah, the son of Zakur, the son of Asaf"
Nechemyah,12,36,"and his kinsmen, Sh’ma‘yah, ‘Azar’el, Milalai, Gilalai, Ma‘ai, N’tan’el, Y’hudah and Hanani, who had the musical instruments of David the man of God. ‘Ezra the Torah-teacher led them."
Nechemyah,12,37,"At the Fountain Gate they went straight ahead up the steps to the City of David, where the wall goes up, passed above the house of David, and went on to the Water Gate on the east."
Nechemyah,12,38,"The other thanksgiving choir, consisting of half the people, walked on the wall to meet them, with myself following. They went above the Tower of the Furnaces to the Broad Wall"
Nechemyah,12,39,"above the Efrayim Gate, by the gate to the Old City, to the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hanan’el and the Tower of the Hundred, as far as the Sheep Gate, and halted at the Prison Gate."
Nechemyah,12,40,"Thus stood the two choirs of those giving thanks in the house of God, with myself and half of the leaders with me."
Nechemyah,12,41,"The cohanim there included Elyakim, Ma‘aseiyah, Minyamin, Mikhayah, Elyo‘einai, Z’kharyah and Hananyah carrying trumpets"
Nechemyah,12,42,"also Ma‘aseiyah, Sh’ma‘yah, El‘azar, ‘Uzi, Y’hochanan, Malkiyah, ‘Eilam and ‘Ezer. The singers sang loudly, directed by Yizrachyah."
Nechemyah,12,43,"With joy they offered great sacrifices that day, for God had made them celebrate with great joy. The women and children too rejoiced, so that the celebrating in Yerushalayim could be heard far off."
Nechemyah,12,44,"At that time, men were appointed to be in charge of the storerooms for supplies, contributions, firstfruits and tenths, and to gather into them, from the fields belonging to the cities, the portions prescribed by the Torah for the cohanim and L’vi’im. For Y’hudah rejoiced over the cohanim and L’vi’im who took their position"
Nechemyah,12,45,"carrying out the duties of their God and the duties of purification, as also did the singers and gatekeepers, in accordance with the order of David and of Shlomo his son."
Nechemyah,12,46,"For back in the days of David and Asaf, there had been leaders for those singing the songs of praise and thanksgiving to God."
Nechemyah,12,47,"So in the days of Z’rubavel and in the days of Nechemyah, all Isra’el gave portions to the singers and gatekeepers as required daily. They set aside a portion for the L’vi’im, who, in turn set aside a portion for the descendants of Aharon."
Nechemyah,13,1,"It was also at that time, when they were reading in the scroll of Moshe, that it was found written that no ‘Amoni or Mo’avi may ever enter the assembly of God"
Nechemyah,13,2,"because they did not supply the people of Isra’el with food and water, but hired Bil‘am against them to put a curse on them — although our God turned the curse into a blessing."
Nechemyah,13,3,"On hearing the Torah, they separated from Isra’el everyone of mixed ancestry."
Nechemyah,13,4,"Also, prior to this, Elyashiv the cohen, who had been put in charge of the storage rooms in the house of our God, and who was related by marriage to Toviyah"
Nechemyah,13,5,"had prepared for him a large room where formerly they had stored the grain offerings, frankincense, equipment and the tenths of grain, wine and olive oil ordered to be given to the L’vi’im, singers and gatekeepers, and the contributions for the cohanim."
Nechemyah,13,6,"During all this time I wasn’t present in Yerushalayim; because in the thirty-second year of Artach’shashta king of Bavel, I went to see the king; then, after some time had passed, I asked permission from the king"
Nechemyah,13,7,"and returned to Yerushalayim, where I found out about the terrible thing Elyashiv had done for Toviyah by preparing a room for him in the courtyards of the house of our God."
Nechemyah,13,8,I was so furious that I threw all Toviyah’s household goods out of the room.
Nechemyah,13,9,"Then, at my order, they cleansed the rooms; and I brought back the equipment of the house of God, the grain offerings and frankincense."
Nechemyah,13,10,"I also learned that the portions for the L’vi’im had not been given to them, so that the L’vi’im and singers who were supposed to be doing the work had deserted, each one to his own farm."
Nechemyah,13,11,"I disputed with the leaders, demanding, “Why is the house of God abandoned?” I gathered the L’vi’im together and restored them to their stations"
Nechemyah,13,12,"and then all Y’hudah brought the tenth of grain, wine and olive oil to the storerooms."
Nechemyah,13,13,"To supervise the storerooms I appointed Shelemyah the cohen, Tzadok the Torah-teacher and, from the L’vi’im, P’dayah; assisting them was Hanan the son of Zakur, the son of Mattanyah; for these were considered reliable. Their duty was to make the distribution to their kinsmen."
Nechemyah,13,14,"My God, remember me for this; don’t wipe out my good deeds which I have done for the house of my God and for his service!"
Nechemyah,13,15,"During this time I saw in Y’hudah some people who were treading winepresses on Shabbat, also bringing in heaps of grain and loading donkeys with it, likewise wine, grapes, figs and all kinds of loads; and they were bringing them into Yerushalayim on the day of Shabbat. On the day when they were planning to sell the food, I warned them not to."
Nechemyah,13,16,"There were also living there people from Tzor who brought in fish and all kinds of goods, and sold them on Shabbat to the people in Y’hudah and even in Yerushalayim."
Nechemyah,13,17,"I disputed with the nobles of Y’hudah, demanding of them, “What is this terrible thing you are doing, profaning the day of Shabbat?"
Nechemyah,13,18,"Didn’t your ancestors do this, and didn’t our God bring all this disaster on us and on this city? Yet you are bringing still more fury against Isra’el by profaning Shabbat!”"
Nechemyah,13,19,"So when the gates of Yerushalayim began to grow dark before Shabbat, I ordered that the doors be shut; and I ordered that they not be reopened until after Shabbat. I put some of my servants in charge of the gates, to see to it that no loads be brought in on Shabbat."
Nechemyah,13,20,The merchants and sellers of all kinds of goods spent the night outside Yerushalayim once or twice
Nechemyah,13,21,"until I warned them, “Why are you spending the night by the wall? Do it again, and I’ll use force against you!” From then on they stopped coming on Shabbat."
Nechemyah,13,22,"Then I ordered the L’vi’im to purify themselves and come and guard the gates, in order to keep the day of Shabbat holy. My God, remember this too for me, and have mercy on me in keeping with the greatness of your grace!"
Nechemyah,13,23,"Also during this time I saw the Judeans who had married women from Ashdod, ‘Amon and Mo’av"
Nechemyah,13,24,"and their children, who spoke half in the language of Ashdod and couldn’t speak in the language the Judeans spoke but only in the language of each people."
Nechemyah,13,25,"I disputed with them and cursed them, and I beat some of them up and pulled out their hair. Then I made them swear by God, “You will not give your daughters as wives for their sons or take their daughters as wives for your sons or for yourselves."
Nechemyah,13,26,"Wasn’t it by doing these things that Shlomo king of Isra’el sinned? There was no king like him among many nations, and his God loved him, and God made him king over all Isra’el; nevertheless the foreign women caused even him to sin."
Nechemyah,13,27,"Are we to give in to you and let you continue in this very great evil, breaking faith with our God by marrying foreign women?”"
Nechemyah,13,28,"One of the sons of Yoyada the son of Elyashiv, the cohen hagadol, had become son-in-law to Sanvalat the Horoni; so I drove him out of my presence."
Nechemyah,13,29,"My God, remember them; because they have defiled the office of cohen and the covenant of the cohanim and L’vi’im."
Nechemyah,13,30,"Thus I cleansed them of everything foreign, and I had the cohanim and L’vi’im resume their duties, each one in his appointed task."
Nechemyah,13,31,"I also made provision for the delivery of wood at stated times, and for the firstfruits. My God, remember me favorably."
