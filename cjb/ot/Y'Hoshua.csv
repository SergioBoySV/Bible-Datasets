Y'Hoshua,1,1,"After the death of Moshe the servant of ADONAI, ADONAI said to Y’hoshua the son of Nun, Moshe’s assistant"
Y'Hoshua,1,2,"“Moshe my servant is dead. So now, get up and cross over this Yarden, you and all the people, to the land I am giving to them, the people of Isra’el."
Y'Hoshua,1,3,"I am giving you every place you will step on with the sole of your foot, as I said to Moshe."
Y'Hoshua,1,4,"All the land from the desert and the L’vanon to the great river, the Euphrates River — all the land of the Hitti — and on to the Great Sea in the west will be your territory."
Y'Hoshua,1,5,"No one will be able to withstand you as long as you live. Just as I was with Moshe, so I will be with you. I will neither fail you nor abandon you."
Y'Hoshua,1,6,"“Be strong, be bold; for you will cause this people to inherit the land I swore to their fathers I would give them."
Y'Hoshua,1,7,Only be strong and very bold in taking care to follow all the Torah which Moshe my servant ordered you to follow; do not turn from it either to the right or to the left; then you will succeed wherever you go.
Y'Hoshua,1,8,"Yes, keep this book of the Torah on your lips, and meditate on it day and night, so that you will take care to act according to everything written in it. Then your undertakings will prosper, and you will succeed."
Y'Hoshua,1,9,"Haven’t I ordered you, ‘Be strong, be bold’? So don’t be afraid or downhearted, because ADONAI your God is with you wherever you go.”"
Y'Hoshua,1,10,Y’hoshua instructed the officials of the people
Y'Hoshua,1,11,"to go through the camp and order the people, “Prepare provisions, because in three days you will cross this Yarden to go in and take possession of the land ADONAI your God is giving you.”"
Y'Hoshua,1,12,"To the Re’uveni, the Gadi and the half-tribe of M’nasheh Y’hoshua said"
Y'Hoshua,1,13,“Remember what Moshe the servant of ADONAI ordered you: ‘ADONAI your God has let you rest and will give you this land.’
Y'Hoshua,1,14,"Your wives, your little ones and your livestock will stay in the land Moshe gave you on the east side of the Yarden; but you are to cross over armed as a fighting force ahead of your brothers, to help them"
Y'Hoshua,1,15,"until ADONAI allows your brothers to rest, as he has allowed you; and they too have taken possession of the land ADONAI your God is giving them. At that point, you will return to the land which is yours and possess it, the land Moshe the servant of ADONAI gave you in ‘Ever-HaYarden to the east, toward the sunrise.”"
Y'Hoshua,1,16,"They answered Y’hoshua, “We will do everything you have ordered us to do, and we will go wherever you send us."
Y'Hoshua,1,17,"Just as we listened to everything Moshe said, so will we listen to you. Only may ADONAI your God be with you as he was with Moshe."
Y'Hoshua,1,18,"If anyone rebels against your order and doesn’t heed what you say in every detail of your order, he will be put to death. Just be strong, be bold!”"
Y'Hoshua,2,1,"Y’hoshua the son of Nun secretly sent two spies from Sheetim with these instructions: “Go, inspect the land and Yericho.” They left and came to the house of a prostitute named Rachav, where they spent the night."
Y'Hoshua,2,2,The king of Yericho was told about it — “Tonight some men from Isra’el came here to reconnoiter the land.”
Y'Hoshua,2,3,"The king of Yericho sent a message to Rachav, “Bring out the men who came to you and are staying in your house, because they have come to reconnoiter all the land.”"
Y'Hoshua,2,4,"However, the woman, after taking the two men and hiding them, replied, “Yes, the men did come to me; but I didn’t know where they had come from."
Y'Hoshua,2,5,"The men left around the time when they shut the gate, when it was dark. Where they went I don’t know; but if you chase after them quickly, you will overtake them.”"
Y'Hoshua,2,6,Actually she had brought them up to the roof and hidden them under some stalks of flax she had spread out there.
Y'Hoshua,2,7,"The men pursued them all the way to the fords at the Yarden; as soon as the pursuit party had left, the gate was shut."
Y'Hoshua,2,8,The two men had not yet lain down when she returned to the roof
Y'Hoshua,2,9,"and said to them, “I know that ADONAI has given you the land. Fear of you has fallen on us; everyone in the land is terrified at the thought of you."
Y'Hoshua,2,10,"We’ve heard how ADONAI dried up the water in the Sea of Suf ahead of you, when you left Egypt; and what you did to the two kings of the Emori on the other side of the Yarden, Sichon and ‘Og, that you completely destroyed them."
Y'Hoshua,2,11,"As soon as we heard it, our hearts failed us. Because of you, everyone is in a state of depression. For ADONAI your God — he is God in heaven above and on the earth below."
Y'Hoshua,2,12,"So, please, swear to me by ADONAI that, since I have been kind to you, you will also be kind to my father’s family. Give me some evidence of your good faith"
Y'Hoshua,2,13,"that you will spare the lives of my father, mother, brothers and sisters and all who are theirs, so that we won’t be killed.”"
Y'Hoshua,2,14,"The men replied to her, “Our lives are certainly worth yours, provided you don’t betray our mission. So when ADONAI gives us the land, we will treat you kindly and in good faith.”"
Y'Hoshua,2,15,"Then she lowered them by a rope through the window; since her house abutted the city wall, indeed was actually built into it."
Y'Hoshua,2,16,"She told them, “Head for the hills, so that the pursuit party won’t get their hands on you; and hide yourselves there for three days, until the pursuers have returned. After that, you can go on your way.”"
Y'Hoshua,2,17,"The men said to her, “We will not be guilty of violating the oath you made us swear, provided that"
Y'Hoshua,2,18,"when we enter the land, you tie this piece of scarlet cord in the window you let us down from; and you gather together in your house your father, mother, brothers, and your father’s entire household."
Y'Hoshua,2,19,"If anyone goes out the doors of your house into the street, he will be responsible for his own blood, and we will be guiltless. But everyone who stays with you in the house — we will be responsible for his blood if anyone lays a hand on him."
Y'Hoshua,2,20,"However, if you say a word about this business of ours, then we will be free of your oath that you made us swear.”"
Y'Hoshua,2,21,"“According to your words, so be it,” she said, and sent them away. As they departed, she tied the scarlet cord in the window."
Y'Hoshua,2,22,"They left, arrived in the hills, and stayed there three days, until the pursuers had returned. The pursuers had searched for them all the way but hadn’t found them."
Y'Hoshua,2,23,"Then the two men returned. Descending from the hills they crossed over and came to Y’hoshua the son of Nun, and reported everything that had happened to them."
Y'Hoshua,2,24,"“Truly ADONAI has handed over all the land to us,” they told Y’hoshua. “Everyone in the land is terrified that we’re coming.”"
Y'Hoshua,3,1,"Y’hoshua got up early in the morning, and they left Sheetim and came to the Yarden, he with all the people of Isra’el; they camped there before crossing."
Y'Hoshua,3,2,"After three days, the officials circulated through the camp"
Y'Hoshua,3,3,"and gave the people these orders: “When you see the ark for the covenant of ADONAI your God and the cohanim, who are L’vi’im, carrying it, you are to leave your position and follow it."
Y'Hoshua,3,4,"But keep a distance between yourelves and it of about a thousand yards — don’t come any closer, so that you will understand which way to go, because you haven’t gone this way before.”"
Y'Hoshua,3,5,"Y’hoshua said to the people, “Consecrate yourselves, because tomorrow ADONAI is going to work wonders among you.”"
Y'Hoshua,3,6,"Then Y’hoshua said to the cohanim, “Take the ark for the covenant, and go on ahead of the people.” They took the ark for the covenant and went ahead of the people."
Y'Hoshua,3,7,"ADONAI said to Y’hoshua, “Starting today, I will make you great in full view of all Isra’el; so that they will know that just as I was with Moshe, so I will be with you."
Y'Hoshua,3,8,"Now you are to order the cohanim carrying the ark for the covenant as follows: ‘When you come to the edge of the Yarden River, you are to stop in the Yarden itself.’”"
Y'Hoshua,3,9,"Y’hoshua said to the people of Isra’el, “Come here, and listen to the words of ADONAI your God.”"
Y'Hoshua,3,10,"Then Y’hoshua said, “Here is how you will know that the living God is here with you and that, without fail, he will drive out from before you the Kena‘ani, the Hitti, the Hivi, the P’rizi, the Girgashi, the Emori and the Y’vusi"
Y'Hoshua,3,11,the ark for the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is going on ahead of you across the Yarden.
Y'Hoshua,3,12,"Now choose yourselves twelve men out of the tribes of Isra’el, one man for each tribe."
Y'Hoshua,3,13,"As soon as the cohanim carrying the ark of ADONAI, the Lord of all the earth, put the soles of their feet in the water of the Yarden, the water of the Yarden will be cut off upstream and stand piled up like an embankment.”"
Y'Hoshua,3,14,"So the people left their tents to cross the Yarden, with the cohanim carrying the ark for the covenant ahead of the people."
Y'Hoshua,3,15,"When those carrying the ark had come to the Yarden, and the cohanim carrying the ark had waded into the water (for throughout harvest season the Yarden overflows its banks)"
Y'Hoshua,3,16,"the water upstream stood piled up like an embankment for a great distance at Adam, the city next to Tzartan; so that the water flowing downstream toward the Sea of the ‘Aravah, the Dead Sea, was completely cut off; and the people crossed over right by Yericho."
Y'Hoshua,3,17,"The cohanim carrying the ark for the covenant of ADONAI stood fast on dry ground in the middle of the Yarden, while all Isra’el crossed on dry ground, until the entire nation had finished crossing the Yarden."
Y'Hoshua,4,1,"After the whole nation had finished crossing the Yarden, ADONAI said to Y’hoshua"
Y'Hoshua,4,2,"“Take for yourselves from the people twelve men, a man from every tribe"
Y'Hoshua,4,3,"and give them this order: ‘Take twelve stones from the middle of the Yarden riverbed, where the cohanim are standing, carry them over with you and set them down in the place where you will camp tonight.’”"
Y'Hoshua,4,4,"Y’hoshua called the twelve men whom he had chosen from the people of Isra’el, a man from every tribe"
Y'Hoshua,4,5,"and said to them, “Go on ahead of the ark of ADONAI your God into the riverbed of the Yarden. Then, each of you take a stone on his shoulder, corresponding to the number of tribes of the people of Isra’el."
Y'Hoshua,4,6,"This will be a sign for you. In the future, when your children ask, ‘What do you mean by these stones?’"
Y'Hoshua,4,7,"you will answer them, ‘It’s because the water in the Yarden was cut off before the ark for the covenant of ADONAI; when it crossed the Yarden, the water in the Yarden was cut off; and these stones are to be a reminder for the people of Isra’el forever.’”"
Y'Hoshua,4,8,"The people of Isra’el did just as Y’hoshua had ordered. They took twelve stones out of the Yarden riverbed, as ADONAI had said to Y’hoshua, corresponding to the number of the tribes of the people of Isra’el, carried them over with them to the place where they were camping, and set them down there."
Y'Hoshua,4,9,"Y’hoshua also set up twelve stones in the Yarden River itself, in the place where the feet of the cohanim carrying the ark for the covenant had stood. They are there to this day."
Y'Hoshua,4,10,"The cohanim carrying the ark stood in the Yarden riverbed until Y’hoshua had finished saying to the people everything that ADONAI had ordered him to say, in keeping with everything that Moshe had ordered Y’hoshua; then the people hurried across."
Y'Hoshua,4,11,"When all the people had finished crossing, the ark of ADONAI passed on, and the cohanim, ahead of the people."
Y'Hoshua,4,12,"The descendants of Re’uven, the descendants of Gad and the half-tribe of M’nasheh went on, armed, ahead of the people of Isra’el, as Moshe had said to them"
Y'Hoshua,4,13,"some 40,000 armed soldiers ready for battle crossed in the presence of ADONAI to the plains of Yericho."
Y'Hoshua,4,14,"That day ADONAI made Y’hoshua great in full view of all Isra’el. They were in awe of him, just as they had been in awe of Moshe all his life."
Y'Hoshua,4,15,ADONAI said to Y’hoshua
Y'Hoshua,4,16,“Order the cohanim carrying the ark for the testimony to come up out of the Yarden.”
Y'Hoshua,4,17,"So Y’hoshua ordered the cohanim, “Come up out of the Yarden!”"
Y'Hoshua,4,18,"The cohanim carrying the ark for the covenant of ADONAI came up from the Yarden riverbed, and as soon as the soles of the feet of the cohanim touched dry ground, the water of the Yarden returned to its place and the river overflowed its banks as it had before."
Y'Hoshua,4,19,"The people came up out of the Yarden on the tenth day of the first month and camped at Gilgal, by the eastern boundary of Yericho."
Y'Hoshua,4,20,"Those twelve stones which they took out of the Yarden, Y’hoshua piled up at Gilgal."
Y'Hoshua,4,21,"Then he said to the people of Isra’el, “In the future, when your children ask their fathers what these stones mean"
Y'Hoshua,4,22,"you are to explain it to them by saying, ‘Isra’el came over this Yarden on dry land."
Y'Hoshua,4,23,"For ADONAI your God dried up the water in the Yarden from in front of you, until you had crossed, just as ADONAI your God did to the Sea of Suf, which he dried up from in front of us, until we had crossed."
Y'Hoshua,4,24,"From this all the peoples of the earth can know that the hand of ADONAI is strong, and you can fear ADONAI your God forever.’”"
Y'Hoshua,5,1,"When all the kings of the Emori on the west side of the Yarden and all the kings of the Kena‘ani near the sea heard how ADONAI had dried up the Yarden River ahead of the people of Isra’el until they had crossed it, their hearts failed them, and they fell into depression because of the people of Isra’el."
Y'Hoshua,5,2,"It was at that time that ADONAI said to Y’hoshua, “Make yourself knives of flint, and circumcise the people of Isra’el again, a second time."
Y'Hoshua,5,3,So Y’hoshua made himself knives of flint and circumcised the people of Isra’el at Giv‘at-Ha‘Aralot [the hill of foreskins].
Y'Hoshua,5,4,"The reason Y’hoshua circumcised was that all the people who had left Egypt who were males, all the fighting men, had died in the desert along the way after leaving Egypt."
Y'Hoshua,5,5,"For although all the people who left Egypt had been circumcised, all those who had been born in the desert on the way as they went on from Egypt had not been circumcised"
Y'Hoshua,5,6,"because the people of Isra’el walked forty years in the desert until the whole nation, that is, the fighting men who had left Egypt, had died out; because they had not heeded what ADONAI said. ADONAI had sworn that he would not allow them to see the land which ADONAI swore to their ancestors that he would give us, a land flowing with milk and honey."
Y'Hoshua,5,7,"So he raised up their children to take their place, and it was these whom Y’hoshua circumcised; till then they had been uncircumcised, because they had not been circumcised while traveling."
Y'Hoshua,5,8,"When all the nation had been circumcised, every one of them, they stayed where they were in camp until they had healed."
Y'Hoshua,5,9,"ADONAI said to Y’hoshua, “Today I have rolled off from you the stigma of Egypt.” This is why the place has been called Gilgal [rolling] ever since."
Y'Hoshua,5,10,"The people of Isra’el camped at Gilgal, and they observed Pesach on the fourteenth day of the month, there on the plains of Yericho."
Y'Hoshua,5,11,"The day after Pesach they ate what the land produced, matzah and roasted ears of grain that day."
Y'Hoshua,5,12,"The following day, after they had eaten food produced in the land, the man ended. From then on the people of Isra’el no longer had man; instead, that year, they ate the produce of the land of Kena‘an."
Y'Hoshua,5,13,"One day, when Y’hoshua was there by Yericho, he raised his eyes and looked; and in front of him stood a man with his drawn sword in his hand. Y’hoshua went over to him and asked him, “Are you on our side or on the side of our enemies?”"
Y'Hoshua,5,14,"“No,” he replied, “but I am the commander of ADONAI’s army; I have come just now.” Y’hoshua fell down with his face to the ground and worshipped him, then asked, “What does my lord have to say to his servant?”"
Y'Hoshua,5,15,"The commander of ADONAI’s army answered Y’hoshua, “Take your sandals off your feet, because the place where you are standing is holy.” And Y’hoshua did so."
Y'Hoshua,6,1,"Yericho had completely barricaded its gates against the people of Isra’el — no one left, and no one entered."
Y'Hoshua,6,2,"ADONAI said to Y’hoshua, “I have handed Yericho over to you, including its king and his warriors."
Y'Hoshua,6,3,You are to encircle the city with all your soldiers and march around it once. Do this for six days.
Y'Hoshua,6,4,"Seven cohanim are to carry seven shofars in front of the ark. On the seventh day you are to march around the city seven times, and the cohanim will blow the shofars."
Y'Hoshua,6,5,"Then they are to blow a long blast on the shofar. On hearing the sound of the shofar, all the people are to shout as loudly as they can; and the wall of the city will fall down flat. Then the people are to go up into the city, each one straight from where he stands.”"
Y'Hoshua,6,6,"Y’hoshua the son of Nun called the cohanim and told them, “Take up the ark for the covenant, and have seven cohanim carry seven shofars ahead of the ark of ADONAI.”"
Y'Hoshua,6,7,"To the people he said, “Move on, encircle the city, and have the army march ahead of the ark of ADONAI.”"
Y'Hoshua,6,8,"When Y’hoshua had spoken to the people, the seven cohanim carrying the seven shofars before ADONAI passed on and blew on the shofars, with the ark for the covenant of ADONAI following them."
Y'Hoshua,6,9,"The fighting men went ahead of the cohanim blowing the shofars, while the rearguard marched after the ark, with incessant blowing on the shofars."
Y'Hoshua,6,10,"Y’hoshua gave this order to the people: “Don’t shout, don’t let your voice be heard, don’t let a single word out of your mouth until the day I tell you to shout; then you will shout.”"
Y'Hoshua,6,11,"So he had the ark of ADONAI make a circle around the city, going around it once; then they returned to camp and stayed in the camp."
Y'Hoshua,6,12,"The next morning Y’hoshua got up early, and the cohanim took up the ark of ADONAI."
Y'Hoshua,6,13,"The seven cohanim carrying the seven shofars ahead of the ark of ADONAI went on, continually blowing on their shofars, with the fighting men marching ahead of them and the rearguard following after the ark of ADONAI; all the while the blowing on the shofars was incessant."
Y'Hoshua,6,14,"The second day, they went around the city once and returned to camp. They did the same for six days."
Y'Hoshua,6,15,"On the seventh day, they got up early, at sunrise, and went around the city in the same way seven times. That was the only day they encircled the city seven times."
Y'Hoshua,6,16,"The seventh time, when the cohanim blew on their shofars, Y’hoshua said to the people, “Shout! because ADONAI has given you the city!"
Y'Hoshua,6,17,"But the city and everything in it is to be set aside for ADONAI and therefore to be destroyed completely; only Rachav the prostitute is to be spared, she and everyone with her in her house, because she hid the messengers we sent."
Y'Hoshua,6,18,"So you, keep clear of everything reserved for destruction. If you bring a curse on yourselves by taking anything set aside to be destroyed, you will bring a curse on the whole camp of Isra’el and cause great distress there."
Y'Hoshua,6,19,"All the silver and gold, and all the brass and iron utensils are to be separated out for ADONAI and added to the treasury of ADONAI.”"
Y'Hoshua,6,20,"So the people shouted, with the shofars blowing. When the people heard the sound of the shofars, the people let out a great shout; and the wall fell down flat; so that the people went up into the city, each one straight ahead of him; and they captured the city."
Y'Hoshua,6,21,"They completely destroyed everything in the city with the sword — men and women, young and old, cattle, sheep and donkeys."
Y'Hoshua,6,22,"Y’hoshua said to the two men who had reconnoitered the land, “Go into the prostitute’s house and bring the woman out with all that she has, as you swore to her.”"
Y'Hoshua,6,23,"The young men, the spies, went in and brought out Rachav with her father, mother, brothers and all she had; they brought out all her relatives and put them safely outside the camp of Isra’el."
Y'Hoshua,6,24,"Then they burned the city to ashes with everything in it, except for the silver, the gold and the brass and iron utensils, which they put in the treasury of the house of ADONAI."
Y'Hoshua,6,25,"But Y’hoshua spared Rachav the prostitute, her father’s household and everything she had; and she has continued living with Isra’el from then until now; because she hid the messengers Y’hoshua had sent to reconnoiter Yericho."
Y'Hoshua,6,26,Y’hoshua then made the people take this oath: “A curse before ADONAI on anyone who rises up and rebuilds this city of Yericho: he will lay its foundation with the loss of his firstborn son and set up its gates with the loss of his youngest son.”
Y'Hoshua,6,27,"So ADONAI was with Y’hoshua, and people heard about him throughout the land."
Y'Hoshua,7,1,"But the people of Isra’el misappropriated some of the goods set aside to be destroyed; for ‘Akhan, the son of Karmi, the son of Zavdi, the son of Zerach, of the tribe of Y’hudah, took some of the things reserved for destruction. In consequence, the anger of ADONAI blazed up against the people of Isra’el."
Y'Hoshua,7,2,"Y’hoshua sent men from Yericho to ‘Ai, which is next to Beit-Aven, east of Beit-El, telling them to go up and spy out the land. So the men went up, reconnoitered ‘Ai"
Y'Hoshua,7,3,"returned to Y’hoshua and told him, “Don’t have all the people go up; but let perhaps two or three thousand men go up and attack ‘Ai. There’s no point in making all the people exert themselves to get there, because there are only a few of them.”"
Y'Hoshua,7,4,"So from the people about three thousand men went up there, but they were routed by the men of ‘Ai."
Y'Hoshua,7,5,"The men of ‘Ai killed some thirty-six of them and chased them from before their gate all the way to Sh’varim, attacking them on the descent. The hearts of the people melted and turned to water."
Y'Hoshua,7,6,"Y’hoshua tore his clothes and fell to his face on the ground before the ark of ADONAI until evening, he and the leaders of Isra’el, and they put dust on their heads."
Y'Hoshua,7,7,"Y’hoshua said, “Oh, Adonai ELOHIM! Why did you take the trouble to bring this people across the Yarden if you meant to hand us over to the Emori and have us perish? We should have been satisfied to live on the other side of the Yarden!"
Y'Hoshua,7,8,"Oh, ADONAI! What can I say, after Isra’el has turned their backs and retreated before their enemies?"
Y'Hoshua,7,9,"For when the Kena‘ani and the other people living in the land hear about it, they will surround us and wipe us off the face of the earth. What will you do then to save the honor of your great name?”"
Y'Hoshua,7,10,"ADONAI said to Y’hoshua, “Stand up! Why are you lying there face down?"
Y'Hoshua,7,11,"Isra’el has sinned. Yes, they have violated my covenant, which I commanded them. They have taken some of what was to have been set aside for destruction. They have stolen it, lied about it and put it with their own things."
Y'Hoshua,7,12,"This is why the people of Isra’el cannot stand before their enemies. They turn their backs on their enemies, because they have come under a curse. I won’t be with you any more unless you destroy the things meant for destruction that you have with you."
Y'Hoshua,7,13,"So get up, consecrate the people, and say, ‘Consecrate yourselves in preparation for tomorrow; for here is what ADONAI the God of Isra’el says: “Isra’el, you have things under the curse of destruction among you; and you will not be able to stand before your enemies until you remove the things that were to have been destroyed from among you.”"
Y'Hoshua,7,14,"Therefore, tomorrow morning you are to come forward, one tribe at a time; the tribe ADONAI takes is to come forward, one family at a time; the family ADONAI takes is to come forward, one household at a time; and the household ADONAI takes is to come forward, one person at a time."
Y'Hoshua,7,15,"The person who is caught with things in his possession that were reserved for destruction is to be burned to ashes, he and everything he has, because he has violated the covenant of ADONAI and has committed a shameful deed in Isra’el.’”"
Y'Hoshua,7,16,"So Y’hoshua got up early in the morning and had Isra’el come forward, one tribe at a time; and the tribe of Y’hudah was taken."
Y'Hoshua,7,17,"He had the families of Y’hudah come forward and took the family of the Zarchi. He had the Zarchi family come forward by household leaders, and Zavdi was taken."
Y'Hoshua,7,18,"He had his household come forward, one person at a time; and ‘Akhan the son of Karmi, the son of Zavdi, the son of Zerach, of the tribe of Y’hudah, was taken."
Y'Hoshua,7,19,"Y’hoshua said to ‘Akhan, “My son, swear to ADONAI, the God of Isra’el, that you will tell the truth and confess to him. Tell me, now, what did you do? Don’t hide anything from me.”"
Y'Hoshua,7,20,"‘Akhan answered Y’hoshua, “It is true: I have sinned against ADONAI, the God of Isra’el. Here is exactly what I did"
Y'Hoshua,7,21,"when I saw there with the spoil a beautiful robe from Shin‘ar, five pounds of silver shekels and a one-and-a-quarter-pound wedge of gold, I really wanted them. So I took them. You will find them hidden in the ground inside my tent, with the silver underneath.”"
Y'Hoshua,7,22,"Y’hoshua sent messengers, who ran to the tent. It was all there, hidden in his tent, including the silver underneath."
Y'Hoshua,7,23,"They took the things from inside the tent, brought them to Y’hoshua and all the people of Isra’el, and put them down before ADONAI."
Y'Hoshua,7,24,"Y’hoshua, together with all Isra’el, took ‘Akhan, the son of Zerach, with the silver, the robe, the gold wedge, his sons, his daughters, his cattle, his donkeys, his sheep, his tent, and everything he had, and brought them up to the Akhor Valley."
Y'Hoshua,7,25,"Y’hoshua said, “Why have you brought trouble on us? Today ADONAI will bring trouble on you!” Then all Isra’el stoned him to death; they burned them to ashes and stoned them."
Y'Hoshua,7,26,"Over him they piled a great mound of stones, which is there to this day. Finally ADONAI turned away from his fierce anger. And this is why that place is called the Valley of Akhor [trouble] to this day."
Y'Hoshua,8,1,"ADONAI said to Y’hoshua, “Don’t be afraid or fall into despair! Take all the people who can fight with you, set out, and go up to ‘Ai; because now I have handed over to you the king of ‘Ai, his people, his city and his land."
Y'Hoshua,8,2,"Do to ‘Ai and its king as you did to Yericho and its king; but this time, take its spoil and cattle as booty for yourselves. Ambush the city from behind.”"
Y'Hoshua,8,3,"So Y’hoshua set out for ‘Ai with all the people who could fight. Y’hoshua chose 30,000 men, the most courageous of his troops, and sent them out by night."
Y'Hoshua,8,4,"He instructed them, “You are to lie in wait to ambush the city from behind. Stay close to the city; and all of you, be ready."
Y'Hoshua,8,5,"I and all the troops with me will approach the city; and when they come out to attack us, as they did before, we will run away from them."
Y'Hoshua,8,6,"They will chase after us until we have drawn them away from the city; because they will say, ‘They’re running away from us, as they did before’; so we’ll run away from them."
Y'Hoshua,8,7,"Then you will jump up from your ambush position and take possession of the city, for ADONAI your God will hand it over to you."
Y'Hoshua,8,8,"When you have captured the city, you are to set it on fire; do according to what ADONAI has said. Those are your orders.”"
Y'Hoshua,8,9,"Y’hoshua sent them out; and they went to the place for the ambush, staying between Beit-El and ‘Ai, to the west of ‘Ai; while Y’hoshua camped that night with the people."
Y'Hoshua,8,10,"Y’hoshua got up early in the morning, mustered his men and went up to ‘Ai ahead of the people, he and the leaders of Isra’el ."
Y'Hoshua,8,11,"All the troops marching with him went up, advanced, arrived in front of the city and camped on the north side of ‘Ai, with a valley between him and ‘Ai."
Y'Hoshua,8,12,"Then he took about 5,000 men and set them in ambush between Beit-El and ‘Ai, to the west of ‘Ai."
Y'Hoshua,8,13,"Thus the people arrayed themselves, with all the army to the north of the city, and their rearguard lying in wait to the west of the city. Y’hoshua spent that night in the valley."
Y'Hoshua,8,14,"The king of ‘Ai saw this, so the men in the city hurried out early in the morning to battle against Isra’el, he and all his people, at a meeting-place facing the ‘Aravah. But he was unaware that behind the city an ambush had been laid against him."
Y'Hoshua,8,15,Y’hoshua and all Isra’el made as if they had been defeated before them and ran off on the road to the desert.
Y'Hoshua,8,16,"All the people in ‘Ai were summoned together to pursue them, so they chased Y’hoshua and were drawn away from the city."
Y'Hoshua,8,17,"Not a man was left in ‘Ai or Beit-El who had not gone after Isra’el; pursuing Isra’el, they left the city wide open."
Y'Hoshua,8,18,"Then ADONAI said to Y’hoshua, “Point the spear in your hand toward ‘Ai, because I will hand it over to you.” Y’hoshua pointed the spear in his hand toward the city."
Y'Hoshua,8,19,"The men in ambush jumped up quickly from their place; the moment he stretched out his hand, they ran, entered the city and captured it; and they hurried to set the city on fire."
Y'Hoshua,8,20,"When the men of ‘Ai looked behind them, they saw it — there was the smoke from the city, rising to the sky; and they had no power to flee this way or that — at which point the people who had run off toward the desert turned back on the pursuers."
Y'Hoshua,8,21,"When Y’hoshua and all Isra’el saw that the ambush had captured the city and that the smoke of the city was going up, they turned back and slaughtered the men of ‘Ai"
Y'Hoshua,8,22,"while the others came out of the city against them too; so that they were surrounded by Isra’el with some on this side and some on that side. They attacked them, allowing none to remain or escape."
Y'Hoshua,8,23,But they took the king of ‘Ai alive and brought him to Y’hoshua.
Y'Hoshua,8,24,"When Isra’el had finished slaughtering all the inhabitants of ‘Ai in the countryside, in the desert where they had pursued them, and they had all fallen, consumed by the sword, then all Isra’el returned to ‘Ai and defeated it with the sword."
Y'Hoshua,8,25,"Twelve thousand men and women fell that day, everyone in ‘Ai."
Y'Hoshua,8,26,"For Y’hoshua did not withdraw his hand, which he had used to point the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of ‘Ai."
Y'Hoshua,8,27,"Only the livestock and the spoil of that city did Isra’el take as booty for themselves, in keeping with the order ADONAI had given Y’hoshua."
Y'Hoshua,8,28,"So Y’hoshua burned down ‘Ai and turned it into a tel forever, so that it remains a ruin to this day."
Y'Hoshua,8,29,"The king of ‘Ai he hanged on a tree until evening; at sundown Y’hoshua gave an order, so they took his carcass down from the tree, threw it at the entrance of the city gate and piled on it a big heap of stones, which is there to this day."
Y'Hoshua,8,30,"Then Y’hoshua built an altar to ADONAI, the God of Isra’el, on Mount ‘Eival"
Y'Hoshua,8,31,"as Moshe the servant of ADONAI had ordered the people of Isra’el to do (this is written in the book of the Torah of Moshe), an altar of uncut stones that no one had touched with an iron tool. On it they offered burnt offerings to ADONAI and sacrificed peace offerings."
Y'Hoshua,8,32,"He wrote there on the stones a copy of the Torah of Moshe, inscribing it in the presence of the people of Isra’el."
Y'Hoshua,8,33,"Then all Isra’el, including their leaders, officials and judges, stood on either side of the ark in front of the cohanim, who were L’vi’im and who carried the ark for the covenant of ADONAI. The foreigners were there along with the citizens. Half of the people were in front of Mount G’rizim and half of them in front of Mount ‘Eival, as Moshe the servant of ADONAI had ordered them earlier in connection with blessing the people of Isra’el."
Y'Hoshua,8,34,"After this, he read all the words of the Torah, the blessing and the curse, according to everything written in the book of the Torah."
Y'Hoshua,8,35,"There was not a word of everything Moshe had ordered that Y’hoshua did not read before all Isra’el assembled, including the women, the little ones and the foreigners living with them."
Y'Hoshua,9,1,"When all the kings on the west side of the Yarden in the hills, in the Sh’felah and all along the shore of the Great Sea that fronts the L’vanon — the Hitti, Emori, Kena‘ani, P’rizi, Hivi and Y’vusi — heard what had happened"
Y'Hoshua,9,2,they joined forces to fight together against Y’hoshua and Isra’el.
Y'Hoshua,9,3,But when the inhabitants of Giv‘ah heard what Y’hoshua had done to Yericho and ‘Ai
Y'Hoshua,9,4,they developed a clever deception: they made themselves look as if they had been on a long journey by putting old sacks on their donkeys and taking used wineskins that had burst and been mended back together.
Y'Hoshua,9,5,"They put old, patched sandals on their feet and dressed in worn-out clothes; and took as provisions nothing but dried-up bread that was crumbling to pieces."
Y'Hoshua,9,6,"Then they went to Y’hoshua in the camp at Gilgal and said to him and the men of Isra’el, “We have come from a country far away. Now, make a covenant with us.”"
Y'Hoshua,9,7,"The men of Isra’el said to the Hivi, “How do we know that you don’t live here among us? If you do, we don’t want to make a covenant with you.”"
Y'Hoshua,9,8,"But they answered Y’hoshua, “We are your servants.” Y’hoshua asked, “Who are you, and where do you come from?”"
Y'Hoshua,9,9,"They answered him, “Your servants have come from a very distant country because of the reputation of ADONAI your God. We have heard reports about him — everything he did in Egypt"
Y'Hoshua,9,10,"and everything he did to the two kings of the Emori across the Yarden, Sichon king of Heshbon and ‘Og king of Bashan at ‘Ashtarot."
Y'Hoshua,9,11,"So our leaders and all the people living in our country said to us, “Take provisions with you for the journey, go to meet them, and say to them, ‘We are your servants, and now make a covenant with us.’"
Y'Hoshua,9,12,Here is the bread which we took for our provisions. It was still warm when we took it out of our homes the day we left to come to you. Now look at it! It’s dry and turned to crumbs!
Y'Hoshua,9,13,"And these wineskins were new when we filled them, but look, now they’re torn. Likewise these clothes of ours and our shoes are worn out because of the very long journey.”"
Y'Hoshua,9,14,The men sampled some of their food but didn’t seek the advice of ADONAI
Y'Hoshua,9,15,"so Y’hoshua made peace with them and made a covenant with them to spare their lives, and the leading officials of the community swore to them."
Y'Hoshua,9,16,"But three days later, after they had made the covenant with them, they heard that they were their neighbors, that they lived there with them."
Y'Hoshua,9,17,"The people of Isra’el traveled and arrived at their cities on the third day. Their cities were Giv‘on, K’firah, Be’erot and Kiryat-Ye‘arim."
Y'Hoshua,9,18,"The people of Isra’el did not attack them, because the leading officials of the community had sworn to them by ADONAI, the God of Isra’el; but all the community grumbled against the leaders."
Y'Hoshua,9,19,"However, the leaders replied to the whole community, “We have sworn to them by ADONAI, the God of Isra’el; so we can’t touch them."
Y'Hoshua,9,20,"Here is what we will do to them: we will let them live, so that God’s anger will not be on us because of the oath we swore to them."
Y'Hoshua,9,21,"Yes, let them live,” the leaders continued, “but let them chop wood and draw water for the whole community.” This is what the leaders said."
Y'Hoshua,9,22,"Y’hoshua summoned them and said this to them: “Why have you deceived us by saying, ‘We come from a place very far away,’ when in fact you are living right here with us?"
Y'Hoshua,9,23,"Now you have a curse on you: you will be slaves forever, supplying people to chop wood and draw water for the house of my God.”"
Y'Hoshua,9,24,"They answered Y’hoshua, “It is because we heard the reports that ADONAI your God had ordered his servant Moshe to give you all the land and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from ahead of you. So we were terrified for our lives on account of you; that’s why we did this."
Y'Hoshua,9,25,"Now, as you see, we are in your hands; do to us whatever seems good and right to you.”"
Y'Hoshua,9,26,"So Y’hoshua did exactly that: he saved them from the power of the people of Isra’el, so that they didn’t kill them."
Y'Hoshua,9,27,But he did that same day make them choppers of wood and drawers of water for the community and for the altar of ADONAI in the place which he would choose; and they remain so to this day.
Y'Hoshua,10,1,When Adoni-Tzedek king of Yerushalayim heard how Y’hoshua had taken ‘Ai and utterly destroyed it — he had done the same to ‘Ai and its king as he had done to Yericho and its king — and how the inhabitants of Giv‘on had made peace with Isra’el and were living among them
Y'Hoshua,10,2,"his people became greatly alarmed; because Giv‘on was as large as one of the royal cities, larger than ‘Ai, and all its men were courageous."
Y'Hoshua,10,3,"So Adoni-Tzedek king of Yerushalayim sent this message to Hoham king of Hevron, Pir’am king of Yarmut, Yafia king of Lakhish and D’vir king of ‘Eglon"
Y'Hoshua,10,4,"“Come up and help me, and we’ll attack Giv‘on, because it has made peace with Y’hoshua and the people of Isra’el.”"
Y'Hoshua,10,5,"So the five kings of the Emori — the kings of Yerushalayim, Hevron, Yarmut, Lakhish and ‘Eglon — got together, went up with all their armies, pitched camp against Giv‘on and made war against it."
Y'Hoshua,10,6,"The people of Giv‘on sent a message to Y’hoshua at their camp in Gilgal that said, “Don’t ignore your servants! Come up to us quickly, and save us! Help us, because all the kings of the Emori living in the hills have gotten together to fight us.”"
Y'Hoshua,10,7,"Y’hoshua went up from Gilgal, he and all the fighting men with him, including all the bravest ones."
Y'Hoshua,10,8,"ADONAI said to Y’hoshua, “Don’t be afraid of them, for I have handed them over to you; not one of their men will stand against you.”"
Y'Hoshua,10,9,"Having spent the entire night marching up from Gilgal, Y’hoshua fell upon them, taking them by surprise."
Y'Hoshua,10,10,"ADONAI threw them into confusion before Isra’el and defeated them in a great slaughter at Giv‘on, pursuing them along the road that goes up from Beit-Horon, and beating them back to ‘Azekah and all the way to Makkedah."
Y'Hoshua,10,11,"As they fled before Isra’el down the road to Beit-Horon, ADONAI threw huge hailstones down on them all the way to ‘Azekah, and they died; more died because of the hail than because Isra’el had killed them with the sword."
Y'Hoshua,10,12,"Then, on the day ADONAI handed over the Emori to the people of Isra’el, Y’hoshua spoke to ADONA I; in the sight of Isra’el he said,
“Sun, stand motionless over Giv‘on!
Moon, you too, over Ayalon Valley!”"
Y'Hoshua,10,13,"So the sun stood still and the moon stayed put,
till Isra’el took vengeance on their enemies.
This is written in the book of Yashar. The sun stood still in the sky and was in no rush to set for nearly a whole day."
Y'Hoshua,10,14,"There has never been a day like that before or since, when ADONAI listened to the voice of a man; it happened because ADONAI was fighting on Isra’el’s behalf."
Y'Hoshua,10,15,Y’hoshua returned with all Isra’el to the camp at Gilgal.
Y'Hoshua,10,16,But those five kings fled and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah
Y'Hoshua,10,17,and it was reported to Y’hoshua that the five kings had been found hiding in the cave at Makkedah.
Y'Hoshua,10,18,"Y’hoshua said, “Roll big stones to the mouth of the cave, and put men there to guard them."
Y'Hoshua,10,19,"However, you, don’t wait, but keep chasing your enemies, and attack those farthest in the rear. Don’t allow them to return to their cities, because ADONAI has handed them over to you.”"
Y'Hoshua,10,20,"After Y’hoshua and the people of Isra’el had finished killing them off in a very great slaughter, till they had been destroyed, and the remaining remnant had entered the fortified cities"
Y'Hoshua,10,21,all the people returned safely to Y’hoshua at the camp in Makkedah; and no one said a word against any of the people of Isra’el.
Y'Hoshua,10,22,"Then Y’hoshua said, “Open up the mouth of the cave, and bring those five kings out of the cave to me."
Y'Hoshua,10,23,"They did it; they brought the five kings out to him — the kings of Yerushalayim, Hevron, Yarmut, Lakhish and ‘Eglon."
Y'Hoshua,10,24,"After they had brought the five kings to Y’hoshua, he summoned all the men of Isra’el and said to the commanders of the soldiers who had gone with him, “Come here and put your feet on the necks of these kings.” They came and put their feet on their necks."
Y'Hoshua,10,25,"Y’hoshua said to them, “Don’t be afraid or confused, but be strong and bold, because this is what ADONAI will do to all your enemies that you fight against.”"
Y'Hoshua,10,26,"With that, Y’hoshua struck them and put them to death, hanging them on five trees, where they remained hanging until evening."
Y'Hoshua,10,27,"At sunset Y’hoshua gave an order, and they lowered them from the trees and threw them into the cave where they had hidden themselves, then laid big stones at the mouth of the cave; and there they remain to this day."
Y'Hoshua,10,28,"Y’hoshua captured Makkedah that day, defeating it and its king by the sword. He completely destroyed them, everyone there — he left no one; and he did to the king of Makkedah what he had done to the king of Yericho."
Y'Hoshua,10,29,"Y’hoshua went on from Makkedah, and all Isra’el with him, to Livnah; and he fought against Livnah."
Y'Hoshua,10,30,"ADONAI also handed it and its king over to Isra’el. He defeated it with the sword, everyone there — he left no one, and he did to its king what he had done to the king of Yericho."
Y'Hoshua,10,31,"Y’hoshua went on from Livnah, and all Isra’el with him, to Lakhish; and he pitched camp against it and fought against it."
Y'Hoshua,10,32,"ADONAI handed it over to Isra’el; he captured it the second day. He defeated it with the sword, everyone there, exactly as he had done to Livnah."
Y'Hoshua,10,33,"But then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lakhish; so Y’hoshua attacked him and his people, until he had no one left with him."
Y'Hoshua,10,34,"Y’hoshua went on from Lakhish, and all Isra’el with him, to ‘Eglon; and he pitched camp against it and fought against it."
Y'Hoshua,10,35,"They captured it that very day. He defeated it with the sword, completely destroying everyone there, exactly as he had done to Lakhish."
Y'Hoshua,10,36,"Y’hoshua went up from ‘Eglon, and all Isra’el with him, to Hevron; and they fought against it."
Y'Hoshua,10,37,"They captured it, defeating it with the sword, including its king, its villages and everyone there; he left no one, exactly as he had done to ‘Eglon; but he completely destroyed it and everyone there."
Y'Hoshua,10,38,"Y’hoshua turned back, and all Isra’el with him, to D’vir and fought against it."
Y'Hoshua,10,39,"They captured it, its king and all its villages, defeating them with the sword and utterly destroying everyone there; he left no one. He did to D’vir and it king as he had done to Hevron and as he had done to Livnah and its king."
Y'Hoshua,10,40,"So Y’hoshua attacked all the land — the hills, the Negev, the Sh’felah and the mountain slopes — and all their kings; he left none but completely destroyed everything that breathed, as ADONAI the God of Isra’el had ordered."
Y'Hoshua,10,41,"Y’hoshua attacked them from Kadesh-Barnea to ‘Azah and all the land of Goshen, as far as Giv‘on."
Y'Hoshua,10,42,"Y’hoshua captured all these kings and their land all at the same time, because ADONAI the God of Isra’el fought on Isra’el’s behalf."
Y'Hoshua,10,43,"Then Y’hoshua returned, and all Isra’el with him, to the camp at Gilgal."
Y'Hoshua,11,1,"When Yavin king of Hatzor heard of it, he informed Yovav king of Madon; the king of Shimron; the king of Akhshaf"
Y'Hoshua,11,2,"the kings to the north, in the hills, in the ‘Aravah south of Kinn’rot, in the Sh’felah and in the regions of Dor on the west"
Y'Hoshua,11,3,"the Kena‘ani to east and west; the Emori, Hitti, P’rizi and Y’vusi in the hills; and the Hivi at the foot of Hermon in the land of Mitzpah."
Y'Hoshua,11,4,"So they set out, they and all their armies, many people, in number like the sand at the seashore, with very many horses and chariots."
Y'Hoshua,11,5,"All these kings met together, then came and pitched camp together at the Merom Spring, to fight Isra’el."
Y'Hoshua,11,6,"ADONAI said to Y’hoshua, “Don’t be afraid on their account; because at this time tomorrow I will hand them over, all of them dead, before Isra’el. You are to hamstring their horses and burn up their chariots.”"
Y'Hoshua,11,7,So Y’hoshua came against them suddenly with all his fighting men and fell on them at the Merom Spring.
Y'Hoshua,11,8,"ADONAI handed them over to Isra’el — they attacked and chased them to Greater Tzidon, Misrefot-Mayim and eastward to the Mitzpeh Valley; they attacked them until none of them was left."
Y'Hoshua,11,9,Y’hoshua did to them what ADONAI had ordered — he hamstrung their horses and burned up their chariots.
Y'Hoshua,11,10,"Then Y’hoshua turned back and captured Hatzor, striking its king dead with the sword; for in time past Hatzor had been the head of all those kingdoms."
Y'Hoshua,11,11,"They put everyone there to death with the sword, completely destroying them; there was nothing left that breathed; and he burned Hatzor to the ground."
Y'Hoshua,11,12,"Y’hoshua captured all the cities of those kings and the kings as well; he defeated them with the sword and completely destroyed them, as Moshe the servant of ADONAI had ordered."
Y'Hoshua,11,13,"But as for the cities built on their tels, Isra’el burned none of them except Hatzor; Y’hoshua did burn that one."
Y'Hoshua,11,14,"All the spoil of these cities and the livestock the people of Isra’el took as booty for themselves; but every human being they put to death with the sword, until they had destroyed them — they left no one breathing."
Y'Hoshua,11,15,"Moshe had given orders to Y’hoshua, just as ADONAI had given orders to Moshe his servant, and Y’hoshua acted accordingly — he did everything ADONAI had ordered Moshe."
Y'Hoshua,11,16,"So Y’hoshua captured all that land, the hills, the Negev, all the land of Goshen, the Sh’felah, the ‘Aravah and the Isra’el hills and Sh’felah"
Y'Hoshua,11,17,"from the bare mountain that goes up to Se‘ir to Ba‘al-Gad in the L’vanon Valley under Mount Hermon; and he took all their kings, struck them and put them to death."
Y'Hoshua,11,18,Y’hoshua made war with all those kings for a long time.
Y'Hoshua,11,19,"Not one city made peace with the people of Isra’el, except for the Hivi living in Giv‘on; they took everything in battle."
Y'Hoshua,11,20,"For it was ADONAI who caused them to harden their hearts and come against Isra’el in battle, so that they would be utterly destroyed, so that they would not find favor but be destroyed, in keeping with the orders ADONAI had given Moshe."
Y'Hoshua,11,21,"Y’hoshua at that time came and cut off the ‘Anakim from the land — from Hevron, D’vir, ‘Anav and from all the hill-country of Y’hudah and Isra’el; Y’hoshua utterly destroyed them and their cities."
Y'Hoshua,11,22,"No ‘Anakim were left in the land of the people of Isra’el — only in ‘Azah, Gat and Ashdod did some remain."
Y'Hoshua,11,23,"Y’hoshua took the whole land, in keeping with all that ADONAI had said to Moshe and to Isra’el according to their divisions into tribes. Then the land rested from war."
Y'Hoshua,12,1,"These are the kings of the land whom the people of Isra’el defeated and of whose land they took possession, across the Yarden toward the east, from the Arnon Valley to Mount Hermon and all the ‘Aravah eastward"
Y'Hoshua,12,2,"Sichon king of the Emori, who lived in Heshbon and ruled the territory that includes ‘Aro‘er, at the edge of the Arnon Valley; the middle of the valley; half of Gil‘ad, to the Yabok River, which forms the border with the people of ‘Amon"
Y'Hoshua,12,3,"the ‘Aravah to Lake Kinneret eastward and to the sea of the ‘Aravah, the Dead Sea, eastward by way of Beit-Yeshimot and on the south under the slopes of Pisgah."
Y'Hoshua,12,4,"There was also the territory of ‘Og king of Bashan, who belonged to the remnant of the Refa’im. He lived at ‘Ashtarot and at Edre‘i"
Y'Hoshua,12,5,"and he ruled Mount Hermon; Salkhah; all Bashan, to the border with the G’shuri and the Ma‘akhati; and half of Gil‘ad, to its border with Sichon king of Heshbon."
Y'Hoshua,12,6,"Moshe the servant of ADONAI, with the people of Isra’el, defeated them; and Moshe the servant of ADONAI gave it to the Re’uveni, the Gadi and the half-tribe of M’nasheh as their possession."
Y'Hoshua,12,7,"Following are the kings of the land whom Y’hoshua, with the people of Isra’el, defeated in the area west of the Yarden, between Ba‘al-Gad in the L’vanon Valley and the bare mountain that goes up to Se‘ir. Y’hoshua gave this land, inhabited by the Hitti, Emori, Kena‘ani, P’rizi, Hivi and Y’vusi, to the tribes of Isra’el to possess, according to their divisions, in the hills, the Sh’felah, the ‘Aravah, the mountain slopes, the desert and the Negev"
Y'Hoshua,12,8,"Following are the kings of the land whom Y’hoshua, with the people of Isra’el, defeated in the area west of the Yarden, between Ba‘al-Gad in the L’vanon Valley and the bare mountain that goes up to Se‘ir. Y’hoshua gave this land, inhabited by the Hitti, Emori, Kena‘ani, P’rizi, Hivi and Y’vusi, to the tribes of Isra’el to possess, according to their divisions, in the hills, the Sh’felah, the ‘Aravah, the mountain slopes, the desert and the Negev"
Y'Hoshua,12,9,"the king of Yericho,
the king of ‘Ai, by Beit-El"
Y'Hoshua,12,10,"the king of Yerushalayim,
the king of Hevron"
Y'Hoshua,12,11,"the king of Yarmut,
the king of Lakhish"
Y'Hoshua,12,12,"the king of ‘Eglon,
the king of Gezer"
Y'Hoshua,12,13,"the king of D’vir,
the king of Geder"
Y'Hoshua,12,14,"the king of Hormah,
the king of ‘Arad"
Y'Hoshua,12,15,"the king of Livnah,
the king of ‘Adulam"
Y'Hoshua,12,16,"the king of Makkedah,
the king of Beit-El"
Y'Hoshua,12,17,"the king of Tapuach,
the king of Hefer"
Y'Hoshua,12,18,"the king of Afek,
the king of Sharon"
Y'Hoshua,12,19,"the king of Madon,
the king of Hatzor"

the king of Megiddo"
Y'Hoshua,12,22,"the king of Kedesh,
the king of Yokne‘am in Karmel"
Y'Hoshua,12,23,"the king of Dor in the region of Dor,
the king of Goyim in the Gilgal, and"
Y'Hoshua,12,24,"the king of Tirtzah —
making a total of thirty-one kings."
Y'Hoshua,13,1,"Now Y’hoshua was old; the years had taken their toll. ADONAI said to him, “You are old, and the years have taken their toll; but there is yet a great deal of land to be possessed."
Y'Hoshua,13,2,“This is the land that still remains: all the regions of the P’lishtim and all the G’shuri
Y'Hoshua,13,3,"from the Shichor which fronts Egypt, to the border of ‘Ekron (northward from there the land is considered as belonging to the Kena‘ani) — that is, the territory of the rulers of the P’lishtim in ‘Azah, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gat and ‘Ekron; also the ‘Avim"
Y'Hoshua,13,4,"to the south; all the land of the Kena‘ani; Me‘arah, which belongs to the Tzidonim, as far as Afek and on to the border with the Emori"
Y'Hoshua,13,5,"the land of the Givli; all the L’vanon eastward, from Ba‘al-Gad at the foot of Mount Hermon to the entrance of Hamat."
Y'Hoshua,13,6,"“As for the inhabitants of the hills between the L’vanon and Misrefot-Mayim, that is, all the Tzidonim, I myself will expel them ahead of the people of Isra’el; all you have to do is assign it to Isra’el as an inheritance, as I have ordered you."
Y'Hoshua,13,7,"So now, divide this land as an inheritance for the nine tribes and the half-tribe of M’nasheh.”"
Y'Hoshua,13,8,"With the half-tribe of M’nasheh, the Re’uveni and the Gadi received their inheritance, which Moshe had given them, beyond the Yarden eastward, just as Moshe the servant of ADONAI had given them "
Y'Hoshua,13,9,"from ‘Aro‘er on the edge of the Arnon Valley, the city in the middle of the valley, all the plateau between Meidva and Divon"
Y'Hoshua,13,10,and all the cities of Sichon king of the Emori who ruled in Heshbon to the border with the people of ‘Amon
Y'Hoshua,13,11,"and Gil‘ad, the territory of the G’shuri and Ma‘akhati, all Mount Hermon, all Bashan as far as Salkhah "
Y'Hoshua,13,12,"that is, all the kingdom of ‘Og in Bashan, who ruled in ‘Ashtarot and Edre‘i. ‘Og was one of those remaining from the Refa’im, whom Moshe defeated and expelled."
Y'Hoshua,13,13,"However, the people of Isra’el expelled neither the G’shuri nor the Ma‘akhati, with the consequence that G’shur and Ma‘akhat have lived among Isra’el to this day."
Y'Hoshua,13,14,Only to the tribe of Levi did Moshe give no inheritance; because the offerings made by fire for ADONAI the God of Isra’el are its inheritance; as [ADONAI] had said to Moshe.
Y'Hoshua,13,15,Moshe gave land to the tribe of the descendants of Re’uven by clans.
Y'Hoshua,13,16,"Their territory included ‘Aro‘er on the edge of the Arnon Valley, the city in the middle of the valley, all the plateau near Meidva"
Y'Hoshua,13,17,"Heshbon and its villages on the plateau, Divon, Bamot-Ba‘al, Beit-Ba‘al-M‘on"
Y'Hoshua,13,18,"Yahatz, K’demot, Mefa‘at"
Y'Hoshua,13,19,"Kiryatayim, Sivmah, Tzeret-Shachar at the top of the valley"
Y'Hoshua,13,20,"Beit-P‘or, the slopes of Pisgah, Beit-Yeshimot"
Y'Hoshua,13,21,"all the cities of the plateau — all the kingdom of Sichon king of the Emori, who ruled in Heshbon. Moshe defeated him with the chiefs of Midyan, along with Evi, Rekem, Tzur, Hur and Reva the princes of Sichon who lived in the land."
Y'Hoshua,13,22,"Along with the others the people of Isra’el killed with the sword, they also struck down Bil‘am the son of B‘or, who practiced divination."
Y'Hoshua,13,23,"The Yarden formed the border for the descendants of Re’uven. This was the inheritance of the descendants of Re’uven by clans, with its cities and villages."
Y'Hoshua,13,24,"Moshe gave land to the tribe of the Gad, to the descendants of Gad by clans."
Y'Hoshua,13,25,"Their territory included Ya‘zer; all the cities of Gil‘ad; half the land of the people of ‘Amon, as far as ‘Aro‘er fronting Rabbah "
Y'Hoshua,13,26,"that is, from Heshbon to Ramot-Mitzpeh and B’tonim; and from Machanayim to the border of Lidvir"
Y'Hoshua,13,27,"while in the valley it included Beit-Haram, Beit-Nimrah, Sukkot and Tzafon — in other words, the rest of the kingdom of Sichon king of Heshbon; with the Yarden to the far end of Lake Kinneret as its border, their territory extended eastward."
Y'Hoshua,13,28,"This is the inheritance of the descendants of Gad by clans, with its cities and villages."
Y'Hoshua,13,29,Moshe gave an inheritance to the half-tribe of the M’nasheh; it was for the half-tribe of the descendants of M’nasheh by clans.
Y'Hoshua,13,30,"Their territory included Machanayim and all of Bashan — that is, all the kingdom of ‘Og king of Bashan; all the villages of Ya’ir in Bashan, sixty cities"
Y'Hoshua,13,31,"half of Gil‘ad; and ‘Ashtarot and Edre‘i, the cities of the kingdom of ‘Og in Bashan. All this was for the descendants of Makhir the son of M’nasheh, or, rather, for half of the descendants of Makhir, by clans."
Y'Hoshua,13,32,"These are the inheritances which Moshe distributed in the plains of Mo’av, beyond the Yarden and Yericho, eastward."
Y'Hoshua,13,33,But to the tribe of Levi Moshe gave no inheritance; ADONAI the God of Isra’el is their inheritance — as he told them.
Y'Hoshua,14,1,"These are the inheritances which the people of Isra’el took in the land of Kena‘an, which El‘azar the cohen, Y’hoshua the son of Nun and the heads of the ancestral clans of the tribes of the people of Isra’el distributed to them"
Y'Hoshua,14,2,"by lot for them to inherit, as ADONAI ordered through Moshe, for the nine tribes and the half-tribe."
Y'Hoshua,14,3,Moshe had already given the inheritances to the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Yarden; to the L’vi’im he gave no inheritance among them.
Y'Hoshua,14,4,"The descendants of Yosef constituted two tribes, M’nasheh and Efrayim; and they gave no portion of the land to the L’vi’im except cities to live in, with the open land surrounding them for their livestock and crops."
Y'Hoshua,14,5,"As ADONAI had ordered Moshe, so the people of Isra’el did — they divided the land."
Y'Hoshua,14,6,"The descendants of Y’hudah approached Y’hoshua in Gilgal, and Kalev the son of Y’funeh the K’nizi said to him, “You know what ADONAI told Moshe the man of God about me and you in Kadesh-Barnea."
Y'Hoshua,14,7,"I was forty years old when Moshe the servant of ADONAI sent me from Kadesh-Barnea to reconnoiter the land, and I brought back to him an honest report."
Y'Hoshua,14,8,"My brothers who went up with me discouraged the people, but I followed ADONAI my God completely."
Y'Hoshua,14,9,"On that day Moshe swore, ‘Surely the land where your foot has been will be the inheritance for you and your descendants forever, because you have followed ADONAI my God completely.’"
Y'Hoshua,14,10,"Now, look: ADONAI has kept me alive these forty-five years, as he said he would, from the time ADONAI said this to Moshe, when Isra’el was going through the desert. Today I am eighty-five years old"
Y'Hoshua,14,11,"but I am as strong today as on the day Moshe sent me — I’m as strong now as I was then, whether for war or simply for going here and there."
Y'Hoshua,14,12,"Therefore, give me this hill, the one ADONAI spoke about on that day; for on that day you heard how the ‘Anakim were there with great, fortified cities; perhaps ADONAI will be with me, and I will drive them away, as ADONAI said.”"
Y'Hoshua,14,13,Y’hoshua blessed him and gave Hevron to Kalev the son of Y’funeh as his inheritance.
Y'Hoshua,14,14,"So Hevron became the inheritance of Kalev the son of Y’funeh the K’nizi, as it is to this day; because he followed ADONAI the God of Isra’el completely."
Y'Hoshua,14,15,(Hevron was formerly called Kiryat-Arba; this Arba was the greatest man among the ‘Anakim.) Then the land had rest from war.
Y'Hoshua,15,1,"The territory chosen by lot for the tribe of the descendants of Y’hudah according to their families extended to the border of Edom in the Tzin Desert, toward the Negev in the far south."
Y'Hoshua,15,2,"Their southern border began at the far shore of the Dead Sea, from the bay facing southward"
Y'Hoshua,15,3,"and went out south of the Scorpion Ascent, passed toward Tzin, went up south of Kadesh-Barnea, passed Hetzron, went up toward Adar, turned toward Karka"
Y'Hoshua,15,4,"passed toward ‘Atzmon, and went out at the Vadi of Egypt, with the border ending at the sea; this will be your southern border."
Y'Hoshua,15,5,"The eastern border was the Dead Sea to where the Yarden entered it.
The northern border began at the bay of the sea at the end of the Yarden"
Y'Hoshua,15,6,then the border went up to Beit-Hoglah and passed north of Beit-‘Aravah; next the border went up to the Stone of Bohan the son of Re’uven
Y'Hoshua,15,7,"then the border went up to D’vir from the Akhor Valley, then northward facing Gilgal (that is, across from Ma‘alei-Adumim, which is on the south side of the vadi); next the border passed to the ‘Ein-Shemesh Spring and went out at ‘Ein-Rogel."
Y'Hoshua,15,8,"Then the border went up the Ben-Hinnom Valley to the south side of the Y’vusi (that is, Yerushalayim), and the border continued up to the top of the hill in front of the Hinnom Valley on the west (which is also at the northernmost end of the Refa’im Valley)"
Y'Hoshua,15,9,"From this hilltop the border was drawn to the source of the Neftoach Spring and continued out to the cities of Mount ‘Efron; next the border was drawn to Ba‘alah (that is, Kiryat-Ye‘arim)."
Y'Hoshua,15,10,"Then the border turned from Ba‘al westward to Mount Se‘ir, passed the spur of Mount Ye‘arim (also called K’salon) on the north, went down to Beit-Shemesh and passed Timnah."
Y'Hoshua,15,11,"Next the border went out toward the side of ‘Ekron northward; and finally, the border was drawn to Shikron, passed Mount Ba‘alah, and went out at Yavne’el, with the border ending at the sea."
Y'Hoshua,15,12,"As for the west border, the Great Sea was its border. These were the borders of the territory of the descendants of Y’hudah, by clans."
Y'Hoshua,15,13,"To Kalev the son of Y’funeh he gave a portion with the descendants of Y’hudah, as ADONAI had ordered Y’hoshua, namely, Kiryat-Arba (Arba was the father of the ‘Anak), also called Hevron."
Y'Hoshua,15,14,"Kalev expelled from there three descendants of ‘Anak — Sheshai, Achiman and Talmai, children of ‘Anak."
Y'Hoshua,15,15,From there he went up to fight the inhabitants of D’vir (D’vir was formerly called Kiryat-Sefer).
Y'Hoshua,15,16,"Kalev said, “To whoever overpowers Kiryat-Sefer and captures it I will give my daughter Akhsah as his wife.”"
Y'Hoshua,15,17,"‘Otni’el the son of K’naz, Kalev’s brother, captured it; so he gave him ‘Akhsah his daughter as his wife."
Y'Hoshua,15,18,"After becoming his wife, she persuaded him to ask her father to give them a field; when she got off her donkey, Kalev asked her, “What do you want?”"
Y'Hoshua,15,19,"She said to him: “Give me a blessing: since you gave me land in the Negev, also give me sources of water.” So Kalev gave her the Upper Springs and the Lower Springs."
Y'Hoshua,15,20,"This is the inheritance of the tribe of the descendants of Y’hudah, by clans."
Y'Hoshua,15,21,"The cities at the outer part of the tribe of Y’hudah toward the border with Edom in the south were: Kavtze’el, ‘Eder, Yagur"
Y'Hoshua,15,22,"Kinah, Dimonah, ‘Ad‘adah"
Y'Hoshua,15,23,"Kedesh, Hatzor, Yitnan"

Y'Hoshua,15,46,"from ‘Ekron to the sea; all those near Ashdod, with their villages"

Y'Hoshua,15,54,"Humtah, Kiryat-Arba (that is, Hevron) and Tzi‘or — nine cities, together with their villages."

Y'Hoshua,15,59,"Ma‘arat, Beit-‘Anot, Elt’kon — six cities, together with their villages."
Y'Hoshua,15,60,"Kiryat-Ba‘al (that is, Kiryat-Ye‘arim) and Rabbah — two cities, together with their villages."
Y'Hoshua,15,61,"In the desert: Beit-‘Aravah, Middin, S’khakhah"
Y'Hoshua,15,62,"Nivshan, ‘Ir-Hamelach and ‘Ein-Gedi — six cities, together with their villages."
Y'Hoshua,15,63,"As for the Y’vusi, who lived in Yerushalayim, the descendants of Y’hudah could not drive them out; so the Y’vusi live with the descendants of Y’hudah in Yerushalayim to this day."
Y'Hoshua,16,1,"The border of the territory chosen by lot for the descendants of Yosef began from the Yarden at Yericho, at the spring of Yericho on the east, went up from Yericho through the hills and desert to Beit-El"
Y'Hoshua,16,2,"went out from Beit-El to Luz, passed on to the border with the Arki to ‘Atarot"
Y'Hoshua,16,3,"went down westward to the border with the Yafleti, to the border of Lower Beit-Horon, on to Gezer and ending at the sea."
Y'Hoshua,16,4,"So the descendants of Yosef, M’nasheh and Efrayim took the inheritance."
Y'Hoshua,16,5,The border of the descendants of Efrayim according to their families was as follows: the eastern border of their inheritance began at ‘Atrot-Adar and went to Upper Beit-Horon
Y'Hoshua,16,6,"then the border extended westward, with Mikhm’tat on the north; next the border turned eastward to Ta’anat-Shiloh and passed by it to the east of Yanochah"
Y'Hoshua,16,7,"then it went down from Yanochah to ‘Atarot, went to Na‘arah, extended to Yericho and ended at the Yarden."
Y'Hoshua,16,8,From Tapuach the border went westward to Vadi Kanah and ended at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the descendants of Efrayim according to their families
Y'Hoshua,16,9,"together with the cities set aside for the descendants of Efrayim inside the territory to be inherited by the descendants of M’nasheh, all the cities with their villages."
Y'Hoshua,16,10,"They did not drive out the Kena‘ani living in Gezer, so the Kena‘ani live together with Efrayim to this day, having become slaves to do the heavy work."
Y'Hoshua,17,1,"This was the territory chosen by lot for the tribe of M’nasheh, for he was the firstborn of Yosef. As for Makhir the firstborn of M’nasheh, the father of Gil‘ad, because he was a warrior he got Gil‘ad and Bashan."
Y'Hoshua,17,2,"So the lot was drawn for the other descendants of M’nasheh according to their families — for the descendants of Avi‘ezer, Helek, Asri’el, Sh’khem, Hefer and Sh’mida; these were the male descendants of M’nasheh according to their families."
Y'Hoshua,17,3,"But Tz’lof’chad the son of Hefer, the son of Gil‘ad, the son of Makhir, the son of M’nasheh, had no sons, only daughters; these are the names of his daughters: Machlah, No‘ah, Hoglah, Milkah and Tirtzah."
Y'Hoshua,17,4,"They approached El‘azar the cohen, Y’hoshua the son of Nun and the leaders and said, “ADONAI ordered Moshe to give us an inheritance together with our kinsmen.” Therefore, in keeping with ADONAI’s order, he gave them an inheritance together with the kinsmen of their father."
Y'Hoshua,17,5,"Thus ten parts fell to M’nasheh, in addition to the land of Gil‘ad and Bashan beyond the Yarden"
Y'Hoshua,17,6,because the daughters of M’nasheh had an inheritance along with his descendants; but the land of Gil‘ad belonged to the rest of the descendants of M’nasheh.
Y'Hoshua,17,7,"The border of M’nasheh began at Asher and went to Mikhm’tat, which is across from Sh’khem; next the border went along to the right, to the people of ‘Ein-Tapuach."
Y'Hoshua,17,8,"The land of Tapuach belonged to M’nasheh, but Tapuach on the border of M’nasheh belonged to the descendants of Efrayim."
Y'Hoshua,17,9,"The border descended to Vadi Kanah, south of the vadi, by cities which belonged to Efrayim among the cities of M’nasheh; but the border with M’nasheh was on the north side of the vadi, and it ended at the sea."
Y'Hoshua,17,10,"Southward it was Efrayim’s, northward it was M’nasheh’s, and the sea was its border; while to the north they extended to Asher, and on the east to Yissakhar."
Y'Hoshua,17,11,"In Asher and Yissakhar, M’nasheh had Beit-Sh’an and its villages; Yivle‘am and its villages; and the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, of ‘Ein-Dor and its villages, of Ta‘anakh and its villages, and of Megiddo and its villages — three districts in all."
Y'Hoshua,17,12,But the descendants of M’nasheh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities; the Kena‘ani wanted to stay in that land.
Y'Hoshua,17,13,"After the people of Isra’el had become strong, they made the Kena‘ani do heavy labor but didn’t completely drive them out."
Y'Hoshua,17,14,"Then the descendants of Yosef spoke to Y’hoshua; they said, “Why have you given me only one lot and only one portion to inherit? After all, I am a great people, since ADONAI has blessed me so.”"
Y'Hoshua,17,15,"Y’hoshua answered them, “If you are a great people, go up to the forest, and clear land for yourself there in the territory of the P’rizi and the Refa’im — since the hills of Efrayim don’t give you enough space.”"
Y'Hoshua,17,16,"The descendants of Yosef replied, “The hills won’t be enough for us; and all the Kena‘ani living in the valleys have iron chariots — both those in Beit-Sh’an and its villages and those in the Yizre‘el Valley.”"
Y'Hoshua,17,17,"Then Y’hoshua said to the house of Yosef, to both Efrayim and M’nasheh, “You are a great people with much power; you will not have only one lot"
Y'Hoshua,17,18,"but the hills too will be yours. Although it is a forest, you will clear it, and the resulting open land will be yours. You will drive out the Kena‘ani, even though they have iron chariots and are strong.”"
Y'Hoshua,18,1,"The entire community of the people of Isra’el assembled themselves together at Shiloh and set up the tent of meeting there, after the land had been subdued before them."
Y'Hoshua,18,2,There still remained among the people of Isra’el seven tribes that had not yet received their inheritance.
Y'Hoshua,18,3,"Y’hoshua said to the people of Isra’el, “How long will you delay going in to take possession of the land which ADONAI the God of your ancestors has given you?"
Y'Hoshua,18,4,"Appoint three men for each tribe; I will commission them; and they are to set out, go through the land and describe it according to their inheritance; then they are to come back to me."
Y'Hoshua,18,5,"They are to divide it into seven portions, with Y’hudah remaining in its territory to the south and the house of Yosef in their territory to the north."
Y'Hoshua,18,6,You will describe seven portions of land and bring the descriptions here to me; then I will cast lots for you here before ADONAI our God.
Y'Hoshua,18,7,"But the L’vi’im have no share with you, because the office of cohen to ADONAI is their inheritance; and Gad and Re’uven and the half-tribe of M’nasheh have received their inheritance beyond the Yarden to the east, which Moshe the servant of ADONAI gave them.”"
Y'Hoshua,18,8,"So the men got up and went. Y’hoshua gave them this commission as they left to describe the land: “Go; walk through the land; and describe it; then come back to me, and I will cast lots for you here before ADONAI in Shiloh.”"
Y'Hoshua,18,9,"The men went and passed through the land, surveying it by cities, dividing it into seven regions and writing the results on a scroll. Then they came to Y’hoshua in the camp at Shiloh."
Y'Hoshua,18,10,"Y’hoshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before ADONAI, and there Y’hoshua divided the land among the people of Isra’el according to their regions."
Y'Hoshua,18,11,The lot for the tribe of the descendants of Binyamin came up according to their families. The border of their territory chosen by lot was between the descendants of Y’hudah and the descendants of Yosef.
Y'Hoshua,18,12,"On the north side, their border began at the Yarden, went up alongside Yericho on the north, continued up through the hills westward and arrived at the Beit-Aven Desert."
Y'Hoshua,18,13,"From there the border passed on to Luz, to the south side of Luz (that is, Beit-El); then the border went down to ‘Atrot-Adar, by the hill on the south side of Lower Beit-Horon."
Y'Hoshua,18,14,"The border was delineated as turning at the western corner and heading southward, from the hill located in front of Beit-Horon on the south; and it ended at Kiryat-Ba‘al (that is, Kiryat-Ye‘arim), a city belonging to the descendants of Y’hudah; this was the west side."
Y'Hoshua,18,15,"On the south the border extended westward from the most distant part of Kiryat-Ye‘arim, going out to the source of the Neftoach Spring."
Y'Hoshua,18,16,"Then the border went down to the farthest part of the hill located in front of the Ben-Hinnom Valley, north of the Refa’im Valley, south of the Y’vusi; and continued down to ‘Ein-Rogel"
Y'Hoshua,18,17,"where it was drawn to the north; then it went on to ‘Ein-Shemesh; continued to G’lilot, which is across from Ma‘alei-Adumim; went down to the Stone of Bohan the son of Re’uven"
Y'Hoshua,18,18,"passed alongside the ‘Aravah, heading north; and went down to the ‘Aravah."
Y'Hoshua,18,19,"Then the border passed alongside Beit-Hoglah, heading north; and the border ended at the north bay of the Dead Sea, at the south end of the Yarden; this was the south border."
Y'Hoshua,18,20,"The Yarden was to be its border on the east side.
This was the inheritance of the descendants of Binyamin, defined by its surrounding borders, according to their families."
Y'Hoshua,18,21,"The cities of the tribe of the descendants of Binyamin according to their families were: Yericho, Beit-Hoglah, ‘Emek-K’tzitz"
Y'Hoshua,18,22,"Beit-‘Aravah, Tz’marayim, Beit-El"
Y'Hoshua,18,23,"‘Avim, Parah, ‘Ofrah"
Y'Hoshua,18,24,"K’far-Ha‘amonah, ‘Ofni and Geva — twelve cities, together with their villages."
Y'Hoshua,18,25,"Giv‘on, Ramah, Be’erot"
Y'Hoshua,18,26,"Mitzpeh, K’firah, Motzah"
Y'Hoshua,18,27,"Rekem, Yirpe’el, Tar’alah"
Y'Hoshua,18,28,"Tzela, Elef, Y’vusi (that is, Yerushalayim), Giv‘at and Kiryat — fourteen cities, together with their villages.
This is the inheritance of the descendants of Binyamin according to their families."
Y'Hoshua,19,1,"The second lot came out for Shim‘on, for the tribe of the descendants of Shim‘on according to their families. Their inheritance was inside the inheritance of the descendants of Y’hudah."
Y'Hoshua,19,2,"For their inheritance they had Be’er-Sheva, Sheva, Moladah"
Y'Hoshua,19,3,"Hatzar-Shu‘al, Balah, ‘Etzem"
Y'Hoshua,19,4,"El-Tolad, B’tul, Hormah"
Y'Hoshua,19,5,"Ziklag, Beit-Markavot, Hatzar-Susah"

Y'Hoshua,19,7,"‘Ayin, Rimmon, ‘Eter and ‘Ashan — four cities, together with their villages"
Y'Hoshua,19,8,"and all the villages surrounding these cities, as far as Ba‘alat-Be’er, Ramah of the Negev. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the descendants of Shim‘on according to their families."
Y'Hoshua,19,9,"The inheritance of the descendants of Shim‘on was taken out of the allotment for the descendants of Y’hudah, because the portion given to the descendants of Y’hudah was too much for them, so the descendants of Shim‘on had an inheritance inside the descendants of Y’hudah."
Y'Hoshua,19,10,The third lot came up for the descendants of Z’vulun according to their families. The border of their inheritance began at Sarid.
Y'Hoshua,19,11,"Then their border went up westward to Mar‘alah, extended to Dabeshet and on to the vadi fronting Yokne‘am."
Y'Hoshua,19,12,"Also from Sarid it turned toward the sunrise to the east to the border of Kislot-Tavor, went on to Dovrat and up to Yafia."
Y'Hoshua,19,13,"From there it passed eastward to Gat-Hefer, on to ‘Et-Katzin, went out at Rimmon and reached to Ne‘ah."
Y'Hoshua,19,14,"Then the border turned on the north side to Hanaton, ending in the Yiftach’el Valley."
Y'Hoshua,19,15,"Also Katat, Nahalal, Shimron, Yid’alah and Beit-Lechem — twelve cities, together with their villages."
Y'Hoshua,19,16,"This is the inheritance of the descendants of Z’vulun according to their families, these cities with their villages."
Y'Hoshua,19,17,"The fourth lot came out for Yissakhar, for the descendants of Yissakhar according to their families."
Y'Hoshua,19,18,"Their territory included Yizre‘el, K’sulot, Shunem"

Y'Hoshua,19,21,"Remet, ‘Ein-Ganim, ‘Ein-Hadah and Beit-Patzetz."
Y'Hoshua,19,22,"Their territory extended to Tavor, Shachatzimah and Beit-Shemesh; and their territory ended at the Yarden — sixteen cities, together with their villages."
Y'Hoshua,19,23,"This is the inheritance of the tribe of the descendants of Yissakhar according to their families, the cities, with their villages."
Y'Hoshua,19,24,The fifth lot came out for the tribe of the descendants of Asher according to their families.
Y'Hoshua,19,25,"Their territory included Helkat, Hali, Beten, Akhshaf"
Y'Hoshua,19,26,"Alamelekh, ‘Am‘ad and Mish’al. It extended to the Karmel on the west and to Shichor-Livnat."
Y'Hoshua,19,27,"The border turned eastward to Beit-Dagon, reached to Z’vulun and the Yiftach’el Valley on its north, then Beit-‘Emek and Ne‘i’el, went out to Kavul on the left"
Y'Hoshua,19,28,"then ‘Evron, Rechov, Hamon, Kanah and on to greater Tzidon."
Y'Hoshua,19,29,The border turned toward Ramah and the fortified city of Tzor; next the border turned to Hosah; and it ended at the sea from Hevel to Akhziv.
Y'Hoshua,19,30,"Also included were ‘Umah, Afek and Rechov — twenty cities, together with their villages."
Y'Hoshua,19,31,"This is the inheritance of the tribe of the descendants of Asher according to their families, these cities with their villages."
Y'Hoshua,19,32,"The sixth lot came out for the descendants of Naftali, for the descendants of Naftali according to their families."
Y'Hoshua,19,33,"Their border went from Helef and the oak in Tza‘ananim, included Adami-Nekev and Yavne’el, went on to Lakum and ended at the Yarden."
Y'Hoshua,19,34,"Westward the border turned to Aznot-Tavor and went out from there to Hukok, reaching to Z’vulun on the south, Asher on the west and Y’hudah at the Yarden toward the east."
Y'Hoshua,19,35,"The fortified cities were Tzidim, Tzer, Hamat, Rakat, Kinneret"

Y'Hoshua,19,37,"Kedesh, Edre‘i, ‘Ein-Hatzor"
Y'Hoshua,19,38,"Yir’on, Migdal-El, Horem, Beit-‘Anat and Beit-Shemesh — nineteen cities, together with their villages."

Y'Hoshua,19,45,"Y’hud, B’nei-Brak, Gat-Rimmon"
Y'Hoshua,19,46,"Yarkon Springs and Rakon, with the border fronting Yafo."
Y'Hoshua,19,47,"The territory of the descendants of Dan was too small for them, so the descendants of Dan went up and fought against Leshem, captured it, defeated it by the sword, took possession of it and lived there, calling Leshem “Dan” after Dan their ancestor."
Y'Hoshua,19,48,"This is the inheritance of the tribe of the descendants of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages."
Y'Hoshua,19,49,"When they had finished distributing the land for inheritance according to its borders, the people of Isra’el gave an inheritance within their territory to Y’hoshua the son of Nun."
Y'Hoshua,19,50,"According to ADONAI’s order they gave him the city he had asked for, Timnat-Serach in the hills of Efrayim; so he built up the city and lived in it."
Y'Hoshua,19,51,"These are the inheritances which El‘azar the cohen, Y’hoshua the son of Nun and the leaders of the ancestral clans of the tribes of the people of Isra’el distributed for inheritance by lot in Shiloh before ADONAI at the door of the tent of meeting. Thus they finished dividing up the land."
Y'Hoshua,20,1,ADONAI said to Y’hoshua
Y'Hoshua,20,2,"“Tell the people of Isra’el, ‘Select the cities of refuge about which I spoke to you through Moshe"
Y'Hoshua,20,3,so that anyone who kills someone by mistake and unknowingly may escape there; they will serve as refuges for you from the next-of-kin avenger.
Y'Hoshua,20,4,"He is to flee to one of those cities, stand at the entrance to the city gate and state his cause to the city leaders. Then they will bring him into the city with them and give him a place, so that he may live among them."
Y'Hoshua,20,5,"If the next-of-kin avenger pursues him, they are not to hand over the killer to him; because he struck his fellow community member unknowingly and had not hated him previously."
Y'Hoshua,20,6,"So he will live in that city until he stands trial before the community, until the death of the cohen hagadol who is in office at the time. When that time comes, the killer may return to his own city and his own house, to the city from which he fled.’”"
Y'Hoshua,20,7,"So they set apart Kedesh in the Galil, in the hills of Naftali; Sh’khem in the hills of Efrayim; and Kiryat-Arba (that is, Hevron) in the hills of Y’hudah."
Y'Hoshua,20,8,"Beyond the Yarden east of Yericho they selected Betzer in the desert, on the plateau, out of the tribe of Re’uven; Ramot in Gil‘ad out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of M’nasheh."
Y'Hoshua,20,9,"These were the cities selected for all the people of Isra’el and for the foreigner living among them, so that anyone who kills any person by mistake could flee there and not die at the hand of the next-of-kin avenger prior to standing trial before the community."
Y'Hoshua,21,1,"Then the leaders of the ancestral clans of the L’vi’im approached El‘azar the cohen, Y’hoshua the son of Nun and the leaders of the ancestral clans of the tribes of the people of Isra’el."
Y'Hoshua,21,2,"It was at Shiloh in the land of Kena‘an that they spoke to them; they said, “ADONAI ordered through Moshe that we be given cities to live in, with the surrounding open land for our livestock.”"
Y'Hoshua,21,3,So out of their inheritance the people of Isra’el gave the L’vi’im the following cities with the surrounding open land
Y'Hoshua,21,4,"The lot came out for the families of the K’hati. The descendants of Aharon the cohen, who were of the L’vi’im, received by lot thirteen cities from the tribes of Y’hudah, Shim‘on and Binyamin."
Y'Hoshua,21,5,The rest of the descendants of K’hat received by lot ten cities from the families of the tribes of Efrayim and Dan and the half-tribe of M’nasheh.
Y'Hoshua,21,6,"The descendants of Gershon received by lot thirteen cities from the families of the tribes of Yissakhar, Asher, Naftali and the half-tribe of M’nasheh in Bashan."
Y'Hoshua,21,7,"The descendants of M’rari according to their families received twelve cities from the tribes of Re’uven, Gad and Z’vulun."
Y'Hoshua,21,8,"The people of Isra’el gave by lot to the L’vi’im these cities with the surrounding open land, as ADONAI had ordered through Moshe."
Y'Hoshua,21,9,They gave from the tribe of the descendants of Y’hudah and from the tribe of the descendants of Shim‘on these cities here mentioned by name
Y'Hoshua,21,10,"they were for the descendants of Aharon, of the families of the K’hati, who were among the descendants of Levi; because theirs was the first lot."
Y'Hoshua,21,11,"They gave them: Kiryat-Arba — this Arba was the father of ‘Anak — (that is, Hevron), in the hills of Y’hudah, with the surrounding open land"
Y'Hoshua,21,12,but the fields and villages of the city they gave to Kalev the son of Y’funeh as his possession.
Y'Hoshua,21,13,"Thus to the descendants of Aharon the cohen they gave: Hevron with its surrounding open land, already a city of refuge for the killer; Livnah with its surrounding open land"
Y'Hoshua,21,14,Yatir with its surrounding open land; Esht’moa with its surrounding open land
Y'Hoshua,21,15,Holon with its surrounding open land; D’vir with its surrounding open land
Y'Hoshua,21,16,"‘Ayin with its surrounding open land, Yutah with its surrounding open land and Beit-Shemesh with its surrounding open land — nine cities out of these two tribes."
Y'Hoshua,21,17,"Out of the tribe of Binyamin: Giv‘on with its surrounding open land, Geva with its surrounding open land"
Y'Hoshua,21,18,‘Anatot with its surrounding open land and ‘Almon with its surrounding open land — four cities.
Y'Hoshua,21,19,"All the cities of the descendants of Aharon, the cohanim, numbered thirteen cities with their surrounding open land."
Y'Hoshua,21,20,"The families of the descendants of K’hat, who were L’vi’im, that is, the rest of the descendants of K’hat, received the cities of their lot. Out of the tribe of Efrayim"
Y'Hoshua,21,21,"they gave them: Sh’khem with its surrounding open land, in the hills of Efrayim, the city of refuge for the killer; Gezer with its surrounding open land"
Y'Hoshua,21,22,Kivtzayim with its surrounding open land and Beit-Horon with its surrounding open land — four cities.
Y'Hoshua,21,23,"Out of the tribe of Dan: Elt’ke with its surrounding open land, Gib’ton with its surrounding open land"
Y'Hoshua,21,24,Ayalon with its surrounding open land and Gat-Rimmon with its surrounding open land — four cities.
Y'Hoshua,21,25,Out of the half-tribe of M’nasheh: Ta‘nakh with its surrounding open land and Gat-Rimmon with its surrounding open land — two cities.
Y'Hoshua,21,26,All the cities of the families of the rest of the descendants of K’hat numbered ten with their surrounding open land.
Y'Hoshua,21,27,"To the descendants of Gershon, of the families of the L’vi’im, out of the half-tribe of M’nasheh they gave: Golan in Bashan with its surrounding open land, the city of refuge for the killer; and B’esht’rah with its surrounding open land — two cities."
Y'Hoshua,21,28,"Out of the tribe of Yissakhar: Kishyon with its surrounding open land, Dovrat with its surrounding open land"
Y'Hoshua,21,29,Yarmut with its surrounding open land and ‘Ein-Ganim with its surrounding open land — four cities.
Y'Hoshua,21,30,"Out of the tribe of Asher: Mishal with its surrounding open land, ‘Avdon with its surrounding open land"
Y'Hoshua,21,31,Helkat with its surrounding open land and Rechov with its surrounding open land — four cities.
Y'Hoshua,21,32,"Out of the tribe of Naftali: Kedesh in the Galil with its surrounding open land, the city of refuge for the killer; Hammot-Dor with its surrounding open land; and Kartan with its surrounding open land — three cities."
Y'Hoshua,21,33,All the cities of the Gershuni according to their families were thirteen cities with their surrounding open land.
Y'Hoshua,21,34,"To the families of the descendants of M’rari, the rest of the L’vi’im, out of the tribe of Z’vulun: Yokne‘am with its surrounding open land, Kartah with its surrounding open land"
Y'Hoshua,21,35,"Dimnah with its surrounding open land and Nahalal with its surrounding open land — four cities. {Out of the tribe of Re’uven: Betzer with its surrounding open land, Yachtzah with its surrounding open land, K’demot with its surrounding open land and Mefa‘at with its surrounding open land — four cities.}*"
Y'Hoshua,21,36,"Out of the tribe of Gad: Ramot in Gil‘ad with its surrounding open land, the city of refuge for the killer; Machanayim with its surrounding open land"
Y'Hoshua,21,37,Heshbon with its surrounding open land and Ya‘zer with its surrounding open land — four cities in all.
Y'Hoshua,21,38,"All these were the cities of the descendants of M’rari according to their families, the rest of the families of the L’vi’im; their lot totaled twelve cities."
Y'Hoshua,21,39,"All the cities of the L’vi’im, forty-eight cities with their surrounding open land, are to be in among the lands possessed by the people of Isra’el "
Y'Hoshua,21,40,"these cities, each with its surrounding open land; thus is it to be with all these cities."
Y'Hoshua,21,41,"So ADONAI gave Isra’el all the land which he swore to give to their ancestors, and they took possession of it and lived in it."
Y'Hoshua,21,42,"Then ADONAI gave them rest all around, according to everything he had sworn to their ancestors. Not a man from all their enemies stood against them; ADONAI handed all their enemies over to them."
Y'Hoshua,21,43,Not one good thing that ADONAI had spoken of to the household of Isra’el failed to happen; it all took place.
Y'Hoshua,22,1,"Then Y’hoshua called the Re’uveni, the Gadi and the half-tribe of M’nasheh"
Y'Hoshua,22,2,"and said to them, “You have done everything Moshe the servant of ADONAI ordered you to do and heeded what I said in all the orders I gave you."
Y'Hoshua,22,3,"All this time you have not abandoned your kinsmen but have obeyed your commission, as ADONAI your God ordered."
Y'Hoshua,22,4,"Now ADONAI your God has given rest to your kinsmen, as he told them he would. So you too, return to your tents in the land which is your possession, which Moshe the servant of ADONAI gave you beyond the Yarden."
Y'Hoshua,22,5,"Only take great care to obey the mitzvah and the Torah which Moshe the servant of ADONAI gave you — to love ADONAI your God, follow all his ways, observe his mitzvot, cling to him, and serve him with all your heart and being.”"
Y'Hoshua,22,6,"Then Y’hoshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went to their tents."
Y'Hoshua,22,7,"(To the one half-tribe of M’nasheh, Moshe had given an inheritance in Bashan; but to the other half, Y’hoshua gave one among their kinsmen on the west side of the Yarden.) When Y’hoshua sent them away to their tents he blessed them"
Y'Hoshua,22,8,"saying, “Return with great riches to your tents — with very much livestock, with silver, gold, bronze, iron and with great quantities of clothing; share the spoil of your enemies with your kinsmen.”"
Y'Hoshua,22,9,"So the descendants of Re’uven, the descendants of Gad and the half-tribe of M’nasheh returned; they left the people of Isra’el in Shiloh, in the land of Kena‘an, to go to the land of Gil‘ad, to the land they were to possess and which they already did possess — according to the order of ADONAI through Moshe."
Y'Hoshua,22,10,"When the descendants of Re’uven, the descendants of Gad and the half-tribe arrived in the area of the land of Kena‘an near the Yarden, they built an altar there by the Yarden, a large, impressive altar."
Y'Hoshua,22,11,"The people of Isra’el heard of it and said, “Look! The descendants of Re’uven, the descendants of Gad and the half-tribe of M’nasheh have built an altar by the frontier of the land of Kena‘an, in the area by the Yarden, on the side that belongs to the people of Isra’el.”"
Y'Hoshua,22,12,"When the people of Isra’el heard of it, the entire community of Isra’el gathered together in Shiloh to wage war against them."
Y'Hoshua,22,13,"The people of Isra’el sent Pinchas the son of El‘azar the cohen into the land of Gil‘ad to the descendants of Re’uven, the descendants of Gad and the half-tribe of M’nasheh."
Y'Hoshua,22,14,"With him were ten leaders, one leader of an ancestral clan for each of the tribes of Isra’el; each one was a head of his ancestral clan among the thousands of Isra’el."
Y'Hoshua,22,15,"They came to the descendants of Re’uven, the descendants of Gad and the half-tribe of M’nasheh in the land of Gil‘ad and spoke with them; they said"
Y'Hoshua,22,16,"“Here is what the whole community of ADONAI is saying: ‘What is this treachery that you have committed against the God of Isra’el, turning away today from following ADONAI, in that you have built yourselves an altar, thus rebelling today against ADONAI?"
Y'Hoshua,22,17,"Is the guilt we incurred at P‘or not enough for us? We haven’t cleansed ourselves from it to this day, even though a plague came on the community of ADONAI."
Y'Hoshua,22,18,"Is this why you have to turn away today from following ADONAI? If you rebel against ADONAI today, he will be angry tomorrow with the whole community of Isra’el."
Y'Hoshua,22,19,"If the land you have taken possession of is unclean, then cross back over into the land which belongs to ADONAI, where the tabernacle of ADONAI is located, and take a possession among us. But don’t rebel against ADONAI, and don’t rebel against us, by building yourselves an altar other than the altar of ADONAI our God."
Y'Hoshua,22,20,"Didn’t Achan the son of Zerach commit a sin in regard to things set aside for destruction, and God’s anger fell on the whole community of Isra’el? He was not the only one who died for his crime.’”"
Y'Hoshua,22,21,"Then the descendants of Re’uven, the descendants of Gad and the half-tribe of M’nasheh answered the leaders of the thousands of Isra’el"
Y'Hoshua,22,22,"“The Mighty One, God, is ADONAI! He knows, and Isra’el will know — if we acted in rebellion or treachery against ADONAI, don’t vindicate us today!"
Y'Hoshua,22,23,"We haven’t built an altar in order to turn away from following ADONAI or to offer on it burnt offerings, grain offerings or sacrifices as peace offerings. If we have, let ADONAI himself require us to atone for it."
Y'Hoshua,22,24,"Rather, we did this out of anxiety, because we thought, ‘Sometime in the future, your descendants might say to our descendants, “You don’t have anything to do with ADONAI, the God of Isra’el"
Y'Hoshua,22,25,"because ADONAI made the Yarden the border between us and you, so you descendants of Re’uven and Gad have no share in ADONAI.”’ In this way your descendants could make our descendants stop fearing ADONAI."
Y'Hoshua,22,26,"So we said, ‘Let us now make preparations and build ourselves an altar, not for burnt offerings or sacrifices"
Y'Hoshua,22,27,"but as a witness between us and you, and between our generations who will come after us, so that we may perform the service for ADONAI in his presence with our burnt offerings, sacrifices and peace offerings — so that your descendants will not say to our descendants at some future time, “You have no share in ADONAI.”’"
Y'Hoshua,22,28,"For this reason we said, ‘When they accuse us or future generations in this way, we will say, “Look! Here is a replica of the altar of ADONAI which our ancestors made, not for burnt offerings or sacrifices, but as a witness between us and you.”’"
Y'Hoshua,22,29,"Far be it from us that we should rebel against ADONAI and turn away today from following ADONAI by building an altar for burnt offerings, grain offerings or sacrifices other than the altar of ADONAI our God which stands in front of his tabernacle!”"
Y'Hoshua,22,30,"When Pinchas the cohen and the leaders of the community, the heads of the thousands of Isra’el who were with him, heard what the descendants of Re’uven, the descendants of Gad and the descendants of M’nasheh said, it satisfied them."
Y'Hoshua,22,31,"Pinchas the son of El‘azar the cohen said to the descendants of Re’uven, the descendants of Gad and the descendants of M’nasheh, “Today we know that ADONAI is here with us, because you have not committed this treasonous act against ADONAI. Now you have saved the people of Isra’el from the anger of ADONAI.”"
Y'Hoshua,22,32,"So Pinchas the son of El‘azar the cohen and the leaders returned from the descendants of Re’uven and Gad, from the land of Gil‘ad to the land of Kena‘an and the people of Isra’el, bringing word back to them."
Y'Hoshua,22,33,What they said satisfied the people of Isra’el. The people of Isra’el blessed God and said no more about going to wage war against the descendants of Re’uven and Gad and destroying the land where they lived.
Y'Hoshua,22,34,The descendants of Re’uven and Gad called the altar “‘Ed [a witness]” between us that ADONAI is God.
Y'Hoshua,23,1,"A long time afterwards, when ADONAI had given Isra’el rest from all their surrounding enemies, and Y’hoshua was old, with age taking its toll"
Y'Hoshua,23,2,"Y’hoshua summoned all Isra’el — their leaders, heads, judges and officials — and said to them, “I am old; age is taking its toll."
Y'Hoshua,23,3,"You have seen everything that ADONAI your God has done to all these nations because of you, for it is ADONAI your God who has fought on your behalf."
Y'Hoshua,23,4,"Here, I have allotted to you land for inheritance according to your tribes between the Yarden and the Great Sea to the west; it includes the land of the nations I have destroyed and the nations which remain."
Y'Hoshua,23,5,"ADONAI your God will thrust them out ahead of you and drive them out of your sight, so that you will possess their land, as ADONAI your God told you."
Y'Hoshua,23,6,“Therefore be very firm about keeping and doing everything written in the book of the Torah of Moshe and not turning aside from it either to the right or to the left.
Y'Hoshua,23,7,"Then you won’t become like those nations remaining among you. Don’t even mention the name of their gods, let alone have people swear by them, serve them or worship them"
Y'Hoshua,23,8,"but cling to ADONAI your God, as you have done to this day."
Y'Hoshua,23,9,"This is why ADONAI has driven out great, strong nations ahead of you; and it explains why no one has prevailed against you to this day"
Y'Hoshua,23,10,"why one man of you has chased a thousand — it is because ADONAI your God has fought on your behalf, as he said to you."
Y'Hoshua,23,11,“Therefore take great care to love ADONAI your God.
Y'Hoshua,23,12,"Otherwise, if you retreat and cling to the remnant of these other nations remaining among you, if you make marriages with them and have children with them and they with you"
Y'Hoshua,23,13,"know for certain that ADONAI your God will stop driving out these nations from your sight. Instead, they will become a snare and a trap for you, whipping your sides and pricking your eyes, until you perish from this good land which ADONAI your God has given you."
Y'Hoshua,23,14,“Today I am going the way of all the earth. Therefore consider in all your heart and being that not one of all the good things ADONAI your God said concerning you has failed to happen; it has all come to pass; nothing of it has failed.
Y'Hoshua,23,15,"Nevertheless, just as all the good things ADONAI your God promised you have come upon you, likewise ADONAI will bring upon you all the bad things too, until he has destroyed you from this good land which ADONAI your God has given you."
Y'Hoshua,23,16,"When you violate the covenant of ADONAI your God, which he ordered you to obey, and go and serve other gods and worship them, then the anger of ADONAI will blaze up against you; and you will perish quickly from the good land which he has given you!”"
Y'Hoshua,24,1,"Y’hoshua gathered all the tribes of Isra’el to Sh’khem; he summoned the leaders, heads, judges and officials of Isra’el; and they presented themselves before God."
Y'Hoshua,24,2,"Y’hoshua said to all the people, “This is what ADONAI the God of Isra’el says: ‘In antiquity your ancestors lived on the other side of the [Euphrates] River — Terach the father of Avraham and Nachor — and they served other gods."
Y'Hoshua,24,3,"I took your ancestor Avraham from beyond the River, led him through all the land of Kena‘an, increased his descendants and gave him Yitz’chak."
Y'Hoshua,24,4,"I gave to Yitz’chak Ya‘akov and ‘Esav. To ‘Esav I gave Mount Se‘ir as his possession, but Ya‘akov and his children went down into Egypt."
Y'Hoshua,24,5,"I sent Moshe and Aharon, I inflicted plagues on Egypt in accordance with what I did among them, and afterwards I brought you out."
Y'Hoshua,24,6,"Yes, I brought your fathers out of Egypt: you arrived at the sea, and the Egyptians were pursuing your ancestors with chariots and horsemen to the Sea of Suf."
Y'Hoshua,24,7,"But when they cried out to ADONAI, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, overwhelmed them with the sea and drowned them. Your eyes saw what I did in Egypt, and then you lived in the desert for a long time."
Y'Hoshua,24,8,"I brought you into the land of the Emori living beyond the Yarden; they fought against you, but I handed them over to you. You took possession of their land, and I destroyed them ahead of you."
Y'Hoshua,24,9,"Then Balak the son of Tzippor, king of Mo’av, rose up and fought against Isra’el. He sent and summoned Bil‘am the son of B‘or to put a curse on you."
Y'Hoshua,24,10,"But I refused to listen to Bil‘am, and he actually blessed you. In this way I rescued you from him."
Y'Hoshua,24,11,"Next you crossed the Yarden and came to Yericho. The men of Yericho fought against you — the Emori, P’rizi, Kena‘ani, Hitti, Girgashi, Hivi and Y’vusi — and I handed them over to you."
Y'Hoshua,24,12,"I sent the hornet ahead of you, driving them out from ahead of you, the two kings of the Emori — it wasn’t by your sword or your bow."
Y'Hoshua,24,13,"Then I gave you a land where you had not worked and cities you had not built, and you live there. You eat fruit from vineyards and olive groves which you did not plant.’"
Y'Hoshua,24,14,"“Therefore fear ADONAI, and serve him truly and sincerely. Put away the gods your ancestors served beyond the [Euphrates]River and in Egypt, and serve ADONAI!"
Y'Hoshua,24,15,"If it seems bad to you to serve ADONAI, then choose today whom you are going to serve! Will it be the gods your ancestors served beyond the River? or the gods of the Emori, in whose land you are living? As for me and my household, we will serve ADONAI!”"
Y'Hoshua,24,16,"The people answered, “Far be it from us that we would abandon ADONAI to serve other gods"
Y'Hoshua,24,17,"because it is ADONAI our God who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from a life of slavery, and did those great signs before our eyes, and preserved us all along the way we traveled and among all the peoples we passed through"
Y'Hoshua,24,18,"and it was ADONAI who drove out from ahead of us all the peoples, the Emori living in the land. Therefore we too will serve ADONAI, for he is our God.”"
Y'Hoshua,24,19,"Y’hoshua said to the people, “You can’t serve ADONAI; because he is a holy God, a jealous God, and he will not forgive your crimes and sins."
Y'Hoshua,24,20,"If you abandon ADONAI and serve foreign gods, he will turn, doing you harm and destroying you after he has done you good.”"
Y'Hoshua,24,21,"But the people said to Y’hoshua, “No, but we will serve ADONAI.”"
Y'Hoshua,24,22,"Y’hoshua said to the people, “You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen ADONAI, to serve him.”
They answered, “We are witnesses.”"
Y'Hoshua,24,23,"“Now,” Y’hoshua urged, “put away the foreign gods you have among you, and turn your hearts to ADONAI, the God of Isra’el.”"
Y'Hoshua,24,24,"The people answered Y’hoshua, “We will serve ADONAI our God; we will pay attention to what he says.”"
Y'Hoshua,24,25,"So Y’hoshua made a covenant with the people that day, laying down for them laws and rulings there in Sh’khem."
Y'Hoshua,24,26,Y’hoshua wrote these words in the book of the Torah of God. Then he took a big stone and set it up there under the oak next to the sanctuary of ADONAI.
Y'Hoshua,24,27,"Y’hoshua said to all the people, “See, this stone will be a witness against us; because it has heard all the words of ADONAI which he said to us; therefore it will be a witness against you, in case you deny your God.”"
Y'Hoshua,24,28,"Then Y’hoshua sent the people away, every man to his inheritance."
Y'Hoshua,24,29,"After this, Y’hoshua the son of Nun, the servant of ADONAI, died; he was 110 years old."
Y'Hoshua,24,30,"They buried him on his property in Timnat-Serach, which is in the hills of Efrayim, north of Mount Ga‘ash."
Y'Hoshua,24,31,Isra’el served ADONAI throughout Y’hoshua’s lifetime and throughout the lifetimes of the leaders who outlived Y’hoshua and had known all the deeds that ADONAI had done on behalf of Isra’el.
Y'Hoshua,24,32,"The bones of Yosef, which the people of Isra’el had brought up from Egypt, they buried in Sh’khem, in the parcel of ground which Ya‘akov had bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Sh’khem for a hundred pieces of silver; and they became a possession of the descendants of Yosef."
Y'Hoshua,24,33,"Finally, El‘azar the son of Aharon died; and they buried him on the hill belonging to Pinchas his son, which had been given to him in the hills of Efrayim."
