Vayikra,1,1,ADONAI called to Moshe and spoke to him from the tent of meeting. He said
Vayikra,1,2,"“Speak to the people of Isra’el; say to them, ‘When any of you brings an offering to ADONAI, you may bring your animal offering either from the herd or from the flock."
Vayikra,1,3,"If his offering is a burnt offering from the herd, he must offer a male without defect. He is to bring it to the entrance of the tent of meeting, so that it can be accepted by ADONAI."
Vayikra,1,4,"He is to lay his hand upon the head of the burnt offering, and it will be accepted on his behalf to make atonement for him."
Vayikra,1,5,"He is to slaughter the young bull before ADONAI ; and the sons of Aharon, the cohanim, are to present the blood. They are to splash the blood against all sides of the altar, which is by the entrance to the tent of meeting."
Vayikra,1,6,He is to skin the burnt offering and cut it in pieces.
Vayikra,1,7,The descendants of Aharon the cohen are to put fire on the altar and arrange wood on the fire.
Vayikra,1,8,"The sons of Aharon, the cohanim, are to arrange the pieces, the head and the fat on the wood which is on the fire on the altar."
Vayikra,1,9,"He is to wash the entrails and lower parts of the legs with water, and the cohen is to cause all of it to go up in smoke on the altar as a burnt offering; it is an offering made by fire, a fragrant aroma for ADONAI."
Vayikra,1,10,"“‘If his offering is from the flock, whether from the sheep or from the goats, for a burnt offering, he must offer a male without defect."
Vayikra,1,11,"He is to slaughter it on the north side of the altar before ADONAI; and the sons of Aharon, the cohanim, are to splash its blood against all sides of the altar."
Vayikra,1,12,"He is to cut it into pieces, and the cohen is to arrange them with the head and fat on the wood which is on the fire on the altar."
Vayikra,1,13,"He is to wash the entrails and lower parts of the legs with water; and the cohen is to offer it all and make it go up in smoke on the altar as a burnt offering; it is an offering made by fire, a fragrant aroma for ADONAI.
(ii)"
Vayikra,1,14,"“‘If his offering to ADONAI is a burnt offering of birds, he must offer a dove or a young pigeon."
Vayikra,1,15,"The cohen is to bring it to the altar, snap off its head and make it go up in smoke on the altar; its blood is to be drained out on the side of the altar."
Vayikra,1,16,He is to remove the food pouch and its feathers from its neck and discard it on the pile of ashes just east of the altar.
Vayikra,1,17,"He is to pull it open with a wing on each side, but without tearing it in half. The cohen is to make it go up in smoke on the altar, on the wood which is on the fire, as a burnt offering; it is an offering made by fire, a fragrant aroma for ADONAI."
Vayikra,2,1,“‘Anyone who brings a grain offering to ADONAI is to make his offering of fine flour; he is to pour olive oil on it and put frankincense on it.
Vayikra,2,2,"He is to bring it to the sons of Aharon, the cohanim. The cohen is to take a handful of fine flour from it, together with its olive oil and all its frankincense, and make this reminder portion go up in smoke on the altar as an offering made by fire, a fragrant aroma for ADONAI."
Vayikra,2,3,But the rest of the grain offering will belong to Aharon and his sons; it is an especially holy part of the offerings for ADONAI made by fire.
Vayikra,2,4,"“‘When you bring a grain offering which has been baked in the oven, it is to consist of either unleavened cakes made of fine flour mixed with olive oil or matzah spread with olive oil."
Vayikra,2,5,"If your offering is a grain offering cooked on a griddle, it is to consist of unleavened fine flour mixed with olive oil"
Vayikra,2,6,you are to break it in pieces and pour olive oil on it — it is a grain offering. (iii)
Vayikra,2,7,"If your offering is a grain offering cooked in a pot, it is to consist of fine flour with olive oil."
Vayikra,2,8,"“‘You are to bring the grain offering prepared in any of these ways to ADONAI ; it is to be presented to the cohen, and he is to bring it to the altar."
Vayikra,2,9,"The cohen is to remove the reminder portion of the grain offering and make it go up in smoke on the altar as an offering made by fire, a fragrant aroma for ADONAI."
Vayikra,2,10,But the rest of the grain offering will belong to Aharon and his sons; it is an especially holy part of the offerings for ADONAI made by fire.
Vayikra,2,11,"“‘No grain offering that you bring to ADONAI is to be made with leaven, because you are not to cause any leaven or honey to go up in smoke as an offering made by fire to ADONAI."
Vayikra,2,12,"As an offering of firstfruits you may bring these to ADONAI, but they are not to be brought up onto the altar to make a fragrant aroma."
Vayikra,2,13,"You are to season every grain offering of yours with salt — do not omit from your grain offering the salt of the covenant with your God, but offer salt with all your offerings."
Vayikra,2,14,"“‘If you bring a grain offering of firstfruits to ADONAI, you are to bring as the grain offering from your firstfruits kernels of grain from fresh ears, dry-roasted with fire."
Vayikra,2,15,"Put olive oil on it, and lay frankincense on it; it is a grain offering."
Vayikra,2,16,"The cohen is to cause the reminder portion of it, its grits and olive oil, with all its frankincense, to go up in smoke; it is an offering made by fire for ADONAI."
Vayikra,3,1,"(iv) “‘If his offering is a sacrifice of peace offerings, then, if he offers before ADONAI an animal from the herd, then, no matter whether it is male or female, it must be without defect."
Vayikra,3,2,"He is to lay his hand on the head of his offering and slaughter it at the entrance to the tent of meeting; and the sons of Aharon, the cohanim, are to splash the blood against all sides of the altar."
Vayikra,3,3,"He is to present the sacrifice of the peace offerings as an offering made by fire to ADONAI; it is to consist of the fat covering the inner organs, all the fat above the inner organs"
Vayikra,3,4,"the two kidneys, the fat on them near the flanks, and the covering of the liver, which he will remove with the kidneys."
Vayikra,3,5,"Aharon’s sons will make it go up in smoke on the altar on top of the burnt offering which is on the wood on the fire; it is an offering made by fire, a fragrant aroma for ADONAI."
Vayikra,3,6,"“‘If his offering for a sacrifice of peace offerings to ADONAI is from the flock, then, when he offers it, no matter whether it is male or female, it must be without defect."
Vayikra,3,7,"If he brings a lamb for his offering, then he is to present it before ADONAI."
Vayikra,3,8,"He is to lay his hand on the head of his offering and slaughter it at the entrance to the tent of meeting, and the sons of Aharon are to splash its blood against all sides of the altar."
Vayikra,3,9,"From the sacrifices made as peace offerings, he is to present ADONAI with an offering made by fire; it is to consist of its fat, the entire fat tail, which he will remove close to the lower backbone, the fat covering the inner organs, all the fat above the inner organs"
Vayikra,3,10,"the two kidneys, the fat on them near the flanks, and the covering of the liver, which he will remove with the kidneys."
Vayikra,3,11,"The cohen will make it go up in smoke on the altar; it is food, an offering made by fire to ADONAI."
Vayikra,3,12,"“‘If his offering is a goat, then he is to present it before ADONAI."
Vayikra,3,13,"He is to lay his hand on its head and slaughter it in front of the tent of meeting, and the sons of Aharon are to splash its blood against all sides of the altar."
Vayikra,3,14,"He is to present from it his offering, an offering made by fire to ADONAI ; it is to consist of the fat covering the inner organs, all the fat above the inner organs"
Vayikra,3,15,"the two kidneys, the fat on them near the flanks, and the covering of the liver, which he will remove with the kidneys."
Vayikra,3,16,"The cohen will make them go up in smoke on the altar; it is food, an offering made by fire to be a fragrant aroma; all the fat belongs to ADONAI."
Vayikra,3,17,It is to be a permanent regulation through all your generations wherever you live that you will eat neither fat nor blood.’”
Vayikra,4,1,(v) ADONAI said to Moshe
Vayikra,4,2,"“Tell the people of Isra’el: ‘If anyone sins inadvertently against any of the mitzvot of ADONAI concerning things which should not be done, if he does any one of them"
Vayikra,4,3,"then, if it is the anointed cohen who sinned and thus brought guilt on the people, he is to offer ADONAI a young bull without defect as a sin offering for the sin he committed."
Vayikra,4,4,"He must bring the bull to the entrance of the tent of meeting before ADONAI, lay his hand on the bull’s head and slaughter the bull in the presence of ADONAI."
Vayikra,4,5,The anointed cohen is to take some of the bull’s blood and bring it to the tent of meeting.
Vayikra,4,6,The cohen is to dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle some of the blood seven times in the presence of ADONAI in front of the curtain of the sanctuary.
Vayikra,4,7,"The cohen is to put some of the blood on the horns of the altar for fragrant incense before ADONAI there in the tent of meeting. All the remaining blood of the bull he is to pour out at the base of the altar for burnt offerings, which is at the entrance to the tent of meeting."
Vayikra,4,8,"He is to remove from the bull for the sin offering all of its fat — the fat covering the inner organs, all the fat above the inner organs"
Vayikra,4,9,"the two kidneys, the fat on them near the flanks, and the covering of the liver, which he will remove with the kidneys"
Vayikra,4,10,as it is removed from an ox sacrificed as a peace offering; and the cohen is to make these parts go up in smoke on the altar for burnt offerings.
Vayikra,4,11,"But the bull’s hide and all its flesh, with its head, the lower parts of its legs, its inner organs and dung "
Vayikra,4,12,"in other words, the entire bull — he is to bring outside the camp to a clean place, where the ashes are emptied out. There he is to burn it on wood with fire; there, where the ashes are emptied out, it is to be burned up."
Vayikra,4,13,"“‘If the entire community of Isra’el inadvertently makes a mistake, with the assembly being unaware of the matter, and they do something against any of the mitzvot of ADONAI concerning things which should not be done, they are guilty."
Vayikra,4,14,"When the sin they have committed becomes known, then the assembly is to offer a young bull as a sin offering and bring it before the tent of meeting."
Vayikra,4,15,The leaders of the community are to lay their hands on the bull’s head and slaughter the bull in the presence of ADONAI.
Vayikra,4,16,The anointed cohen is to bring some of the bull’s blood to the tent of meeting.
Vayikra,4,17,The cohen is to dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times in the presence of ADONAI in front of the curtain.
Vayikra,4,18,"He is to put some of the blood on the horns of the altar before ADONAI, there in the tent of meeting. All the remaining blood he is to pour out at the base of the altar for burnt offerings, which is at the entrance to the tent of meeting."
Vayikra,4,19,He is to remove all its fat and make it go up in smoke on the altar.
Vayikra,4,20,"This is what he is to do with the bull — he must do the same with this bull as he does with the one for the sin offering. Thus the cohen will make atonement for them, and they will be forgiven."
Vayikra,4,21,He is to bring the bull outside the camp and burn it as he burned the first bull; it is the sin offering for the assembly.
Vayikra,4,22,"“‘When a leader sins and inadvertently does something against any of the mitzvot of ADONAI concerning things which should not be done, he is guilty."
Vayikra,4,23,"If the sin which he committed becomes known to him, he is to bring as his offering a male goat without defect"
Vayikra,4,24,lay his hand on the goat’s head and slaughter it in the place where they slaughter the burnt offering in the presence of ADONAI ; it is a sin offering.
Vayikra,4,25,The cohen is to take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar for burnt offerings. Its remaining blood he is to pour out at the base of the altar for burnt offerings.
Vayikra,4,26,"All its fat he is to make go up in smoke on the altar, like the fat of the sacrifice for peace offerings; thus the cohen will make atonement for him in regard to his sin, and he will be forgiven.
(vi)"
Vayikra,4,27,"“‘If an individual among the people commits a sin inadvertently, doing something against any of the mitzvot of ADONAI concerning things which should not be done, he is guilty."
Vayikra,4,28,"If the sin he committed becomes known to him, he is to bring as his offering a female goat without defect for the sin he committed"
Vayikra,4,29,lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter the sin offering in the place of burnt offerings.
Vayikra,4,30,The cohen is to take some of its blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar for burnt offerings. All its remaining blood he is to pour out at the base of the altar.
Vayikra,4,31,"All its fat he is to remove, as the fat is removed from the sacrifice for peace offerings; and the cohen is to make it go up in smoke on the altar as a fragrant aroma for ADONAI. Thus the cohen will make atonement for him, and he will be forgiven."
Vayikra,4,32,"“‘If he brings a lamb as his sin offering, he is to bring a female without defect"
Vayikra,4,33,lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter it as a sin offering in the place where they slaughter burnt offerings.
Vayikra,4,34,The cohen is to take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar for burnt offerings. All its remaining blood he is to pour out at the base of the altar.
Vayikra,4,35,"All its fat he is to remove, as the fat of a lamb is removed from the sacrifice for peace offerings; and the cohen is to make it go up in smoke on the altar on top of the offerings for ADONAI made by fire. Thus the cohen will make atonement for him in regard to the sin he committed, and he will be forgiven."
Vayikra,5,1,"“‘If a person who is a witness, sworn to testify, sins by refusing to tell what he has seen or heard about the matter, he must bear the consequences."
Vayikra,5,2,"If a person touches something unclean, whether the carcass of an unclean wild animal, a domestic animal or a reptile, he is guilty, even though he may not be aware that he is unclean."
Vayikra,5,3,"If he touches some human uncleanness, no matter what the source of his uncleanness is, and is unaware of it, then, when he learns of it, he is guilty."
Vayikra,5,4,"If someone allows to slip from his mouth an oath to do evil or to do good, and he doesn’t remember that he clearly spoke this oath, then, no matter what it was about, when he learns of it, he is guilty."
Vayikra,5,5,A person guilty of any of these things is to confess in what manner he sinned
Vayikra,5,6,"and bring his guilt offering to ADONAI for the sin he committed; it is to be a female from the flock, either a lamb or a goat, as a sin offering; and the cohen will make atonement for him in regard to his sin."
Vayikra,5,7,"“‘If he can’t afford a lamb, he is to bring as his guilt offering for the sin he committed two doves or two young pigeons for ADONAI — the one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering."
Vayikra,5,8,"He is to bring them to the cohen, who will offer the one for a sin offering first. He is to wring its neck but not remove the head"
Vayikra,5,9,sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar and drain out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar; it is a sin offering.
Vayikra,5,10,"He is to prepare the second as a burnt offering in the manner prescribed. Thus the cohen will make atonement for him in regard to the sin which he committed, and he will be forgiven.
(vii)"
Vayikra,5,11,"“‘But if his means are insufficient even for two doves or two young pigeons, then he is to bring as his offering for the sin he committed two quarts of fine flour for a sin offering; he is not to put any olive oil or frankincense on it, because it is a sin offering."
Vayikra,5,12,"He is to bring it to the cohen, and the cohen is to take a handful of it as its reminder portion and make it go up in smoke on the altar on top of the offerings for ADONAI made by fire; it is a sin offering."
Vayikra,5,13,"Thus the cohen will make atonement for him in regard to the sin he committed concerning any of these things, and he will be forgiven. The rest will belong to the cohanim, as with a grain offering.’”"
Vayikra,5,14,ADONAI said to Moshe
Vayikra,5,15,"“If anyone acts improperly and inadvertently sins in regard to the holy things of ADONAI, he is to bring as his guilt offering for ADONAI a ram without defect from the flock or its equivalent in silver shekels (using the sanctuary shekel as the standard), according to your appraisal of its value; it is a guilt offering."
Vayikra,5,16,"In addition, he is to make restitution for whatever he did wrong in regard to the holy thing; moreover, he is to add to that one-fifth and give it to the cohen. Then the cohen will make atonement with the ram of the guilt offering, and he will be forgiven."
Vayikra,5,17,"“If someone sins by doing something against any of the mitzvot of ADONAI concerning things which should not be done, he is guilty, even if he is unaware of it; and he bears the consequences of his wrongdoing."
Vayikra,5,18,"He must bring a ram without defect from the flock, or its equivalent according to your appraisal, to the cohen for a guilt offering; the cohen will make atonement concerning the error which he committed, even though he was unaware of it; and he will be forgiven."
Vayikra,5,19,It is a guilt offering — he is certainly guilty before ADONAI.”
Vayikra,5,20,ADONAI said to Moshe
Vayikra,5,21,"“If someone sins and acts perversely against ADONAI by dealing falsely with his neighbor in regard to a deposit or security entrusted to him, by stealing from him, by extorting him"
Vayikra,5,22,"or by dealing falsely in regard to a lost object he has found, or by swearing to a lie — if a person commits any of these sins"
Vayikra,5,23,"then, if he sinned and is guilty, he is to restore whatever it was he stole or obtained by extortion, or whatever was deposited with him, or the lost object which he found, (Maftir)"
Vayikra,5,24,"or anything about which he has sworn falsely. He is to restore it in full plus an additional one-fifth; he must return it to the person who owns it, on the day when he presents his guilt offering."
Vayikra,5,25,"He is to bring as his guilt offering to ADONAI a ram without defect from the flock, or its equivalent according to your appraisal, to the cohen; it is a guilt offering."
Vayikra,5,26,"Thus the cohen will make atonement for him before ADONAI, and he will be forgiven in regard to whatever it was he did that made him guilty.

B’rit Hadashah suggested readings for Parashah Vayikra: Romans 8:1–13; Messianic Jews (Hebrews) 10:1–14; 13:10–16"
Vayikra,6,1,ADONAI said to Moshe
Vayikra,6,2,"“Give this order to Aharon and his sons: ‘This is the law for the burnt offering : it is what goes up on its firewood upon the altar all night long, until morning; in this way the fire of the altar will be kept burning."
Vayikra,6,3,"When the fire has consumed the burnt offering on the altar, the cohen, having put on his linen garment and covered himself with his linen shorts, is to remove the ashes and put them beside the altar."
Vayikra,6,4,"Then he is to remove those garments and put on others, before carrying the ashes outside the camp to a clean place."
Vayikra,6,5,"In this way, the fire on the altar will be kept burning and not be allowed to go out. Each morning, the cohen is to kindle wood on it, arrange the burnt offering and make the fat of the peace offerings go up in smoke."
Vayikra,6,6,Fire is to be kept burning on the altar continually; it is not to go out.
Vayikra,6,7,“‘This is the law for the grain offering: the sons of Aharon are to offer it before ADONAI in front of the altar.
Vayikra,6,8,"He is to take from the grain offering a handful of its fine flour, some of its olive oil and all of the frankincense which is on the grain offering; and he is to make this reminder portion of it go up in smoke on the altar as a fragrant aroma for ADONAI."
Vayikra,6,9,The rest of it Aharon and his sons are to eat; it is to be eaten without leaven in a holy place — they are to eat it in the courtyard of the tent of meeting.
Vayikra,6,10,"It is not to be baked with leaven. I have given it as their portion of my offerings made by fire; like the sin offering and the guilt offering, it is especially holy."
Vayikra,6,11,"Every male descendant of Aharon may eat from it; it is his share of the offerings for ADONAI made by fire forever through all your generations. Whatever touches those offerings will become holy.’”
(ii)"
Vayikra,6,12,ADONAI said to Moshe
Vayikra,6,13,"“This is the offering for ADONAI that Aharon and his sons are to offer on the day he is anointed: two quarts of fine flour, half of it in the morning and half in the evening, as a grain offering from then on."
Vayikra,6,14,"It is to be well mixed with olive oil and fried on a griddle; then bring it in, break it in pieces and offer the grain offering as a fragrant aroma for ADONAI."
Vayikra,6,15,The anointed cohen who will take Aharon’s place from among his descendants will offer it; it is a perpetual obligation. It must be entirely made to go up in smoke for ADONAI
Vayikra,6,16,every grain offering of the cohen is to be entirely made to go up in smoke — it is not to be eaten.”
Vayikra,6,17,ADONAI said to Moshe
Vayikra,6,18,"“Tell Aharon and his sons, ‘This is the law for the sin offering: the sin offering is to be slaughtered before ADONAI in the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered; it is especially holy."
Vayikra,6,19,"The cohen who offers it for sin is to eat it — it is to be eaten in a holy place, in the courtyard of the tent of meeting."
Vayikra,6,20,"Whatever touches its flesh will become holy; if any of its blood splashes on any item of clothing, you are to wash it in a holy place."
Vayikra,6,21,"The clay pot in which it is cooked must be broken; if it is cooked in a bronze pot, it must be scoured and rinsed in water."
Vayikra,6,22,Any male from a family of cohanim may eat the sin offering; it is especially holy.
Vayikra,6,23,But no sin offering which has had any of its blood brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the Holy Place is to be eaten; it is to be burned up completely.
Vayikra,7,1,“‘This is the law for the guilt offering: it is especially holy.
Vayikra,7,2,"They are to slaughter the guilt offering in the place where they slaughter the burnt offering, and its blood is to be splashed against all sides of the altar."
Vayikra,7,3,"He is to offer all its fat — the fat tail, the fat covering the inner organs"
Vayikra,7,4,"the two kidneys, the fat on them near the flanks, and the covering of the liver, which he will remove with the kidneys."
Vayikra,7,5,The cohen will make them go up in smoke on the altar as an offering made by fire to ADONAI ; it is a guilt offering.
Vayikra,7,6,Every male from a family of cohanim may eat it; it is to be eaten in a holy place; it is especially holy.
Vayikra,7,7,The guilt offering is like the sin offering; the same law governs them — it will belong to the cohen who uses it to make atonement.
Vayikra,7,8,“‘The cohen who offers someone’s burnt offering will possess the hide of the burnt offering which he has offered.
Vayikra,7,9,"“‘Every grain offering baked in the oven, cooked in a pot or fried on a griddle will belong to the cohen who offers it."
Vayikra,7,10,"But every grain offering which is mixed with olive oil or is dry will belong to all the sons of Aharon equally.
(iii)"
Vayikra,7,11,“‘This is the law for sacrificing peace offerings offered to ADONAI
Vayikra,7,12,"If a person offers it for giving thanks, he is to offer it with the thanksgiving sacrifice of unleavened cakes mixed with olive oil, matzah spread with olive oil, and cakes made of fine flour mixed with olive oil and fried."
Vayikra,7,13,With cakes of leavened bread he is to present his offering together with the sacrifice of his peace offerings for giving thanks.
Vayikra,7,14,From each kind of offering he is to present one as a gift for ADONAI; it will belong to the cohen who splashes the blood of the peace offerings against the altar.
Vayikra,7,15,The meat of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for giving thanks is to be eaten on the day of his offering; he is not to leave any of it until morning.
Vayikra,7,16,"But if the sacrifice connected with his offering is for a vow or is a voluntary offering, then, while it is to be eaten on the day he offers his sacrifice, what remains of it may be eaten the next day."
Vayikra,7,17,"However, what remains of the meat of the sacrifice on the third day is to be burned up completely."
Vayikra,7,18,"If any of the meat of the sacrifice of his peace offerings is eaten on the third day, the sacrifice will neither be accepted nor credited to the person offering it; rather, it will have become a disgusting thing, and whoever eats it will bear the consequences of his wrongdoing."
Vayikra,7,19,"Meat which touches something unclean is not to be eaten but burned up completely. As for the meat, everyone who is clean may eat it"
Vayikra,7,20,but a person in a state of uncleanness who eats any meat from the sacrifice of peace offerings made to ADONAI will be cut off from his people.
Vayikra,7,21,"Anyone who touches something unclean — whether the uncleanness be from a person, from an unclean animal or from some other unclean detestable thing — and then eats the meat from the sacrifice of peace offerings for ADONAI, that person will be cut off from his people.’”"
Vayikra,7,22,ADONAI said to Moshe
Vayikra,7,23,"“Say to the people of Isra’el, ‘You are not to eat the fat of bulls, sheep or goats."
Vayikra,7,24,"The fat of animals that die of themselves or are killed by wild animals may be used for any other purpose, but under no circumstances are you to eat it."
Vayikra,7,25,For whoever eats the fat of animals of the kind used in presenting an offering made by fire to ADONAI will be cut off from his people.
Vayikra,7,26,"You are not to eat any kind of blood, whether from birds or animals, in any of your homes."
Vayikra,7,27,Whoever eats any blood will be cut off from his people.’”
Vayikra,7,28,ADONAI said to Moshe
Vayikra,7,29,"“Say to the people of Isra’el, ‘A person who offers his sacrifice of peace offerings to ADONAI is to bring part of his sacrifice of peace offerings as his offering for ADONAI."
Vayikra,7,30,He is to bring with his own hands the offerings for ADONAI made by fire — he is to bring the breast with its fat. The breast is to be waved as a wave offering before ADONAI.
Vayikra,7,31,"The cohen is to make the fat go up in smoke on the altar, but the breast will belong to Aharon and his descendants."
Vayikra,7,32,You are to give the right thigh from your sacrifices of peace offerings to the cohen as a contribution.
Vayikra,7,33,The descendant of Aharon who offers the blood of the peace offerings is to have the right thigh as his share.
Vayikra,7,34,For the breast that has been waved and the thigh that has been contributed I have taken from the people of Isra’el out of their sacrifices of peace offerings and given them to Aharon the cohen and to his descendants as their share forever from the people of Isra’el.’”
Vayikra,7,35,"On the day when Aharon and his sons were presented to serve ADONAI in the office of cohen, this portion was set aside for him and his descendants from the offerings for ADONAI made by fire."
Vayikra,7,36,"On the day they were anointed, ADONAI ordered that this be given to them by the people of Isra’el. It is their share forever through all their generations."
Vayikra,7,37,"This is the law for the burnt offering, the grain offering, the sin offering, the guilt offering, the consecration offering and the sacrifice of peace offerings"
Vayikra,7,38,"which ADONAI ordered Moshe on Mount Sinai on the day he ordered the people of Isra’el to present their offerings to ADONAI, in the Sinai Desert."
Vayikra,8,1,(iv) ADONAI said to Moshe
Vayikra,8,2,"“Take Aharon and his sons with him, the garments, the anointing oil, the bull for the sin offering, the two rams and the basket of matzah"
Vayikra,8,3,and assemble the entire community at the entrance to the tent of meeting.”
Vayikra,8,4,"Moshe did as ADONAI ordered him, and the community was assembled at the entrance to the tent of meeting."
Vayikra,8,5,"Moshe said to the community, “This is what ADONAI has ordered to be done.”"
Vayikra,8,6,"Moshe brought Aharon and his sons, washed them with water"
Vayikra,8,7,"put the tunic on him, wrapped the sash around him, clothed him with the robe, put the ritual vest on him, wrapped around him the decorated belt and fastened the vest to him with it."
Vayikra,8,8,"He put the breastplate on him, and on the breastplate he put the urim and tumim."
Vayikra,8,9,"He set the turban on his head, and on the front of the turban he affixed the gold plate, the holy ornament, as ADONAI had ordered Moshe."
Vayikra,8,10,"Then Moshe took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and everything in it, thus consecrating them."
Vayikra,8,11,"He sprinkled some on the altar seven times, anointing the altar with all its utensils and the basin with its base, to consecrate them."
Vayikra,8,12,"He poured some of the anointing oil on Aharon’s head and anointed him, to consecrate him."
Vayikra,8,13,"Moshe brought Aharon’s sons, clothed them with tunics, wrapped sashes on them and put headgear on them, as ADONAI had ordered Moshe.
(v)"
Vayikra,8,14,"Then the young bull for the sin offering was brought, and Aharon and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull for the sin offering."
Vayikra,8,15,"After it had been slaughtered, Moshe took the blood and put it on the horns of the altar all the way around with his finger, thus purifying the altar. The remaining blood he poured out at the base of the altar and consecrated it, to make atonement for it."
Vayikra,8,16,"Moshe took all the fat on the inner organs, the covering of the liver, the two kidneys and their fat, and made it go up in smoke on the altar."
Vayikra,8,17,"But the bull, its hide, its flesh and its dung were taken outside the camp and burned up completely, as ADONAI had ordered Moshe."
Vayikra,8,18,"Next, the ram for the burnt offering was presented. Aharon and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram"
Vayikra,8,19,"and after it had been slaughtered, Moshe splashed the blood on all sides of the altar."
Vayikra,8,20,"When the ram had been cut in pieces, Moshe made the head, the pieces and the fat go up in smoke."
Vayikra,8,21,"When the inner organs and the lower parts of the legs had been washed with water, Moshe made the entire ram go up in smoke on the altar; it was a burnt offering giving a fragrant aroma, an offering made by fire to ADONAI — as ADONAI had ordered Moshe.
(vi)"
Vayikra,8,22,"Then the other ram was presented, the ram of consecration; Aharon and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram."
Vayikra,8,23,"After it had been slaughtered, Moshe took some of its blood and put it on the tip of Aharon’s right ear, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot."
Vayikra,8,24,"Next Aharon’s sons were brought, and Moshe put some of the blood on the tips of their right ears, on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet; then Moshe splashed the blood on all sides of the altar."
Vayikra,8,25,"He took the fat, the fat tail, all the fat covering the inner organs, the covering of the liver, the two kidneys with their fat, and the right thigh."
Vayikra,8,26,"From the basket of matzah that was before ADONAI he took one piece of matzah, one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and placed them on the fat and on the right thigh."
Vayikra,8,27,Then he put it all in Aharon’s hands and in the hands of his sons and waved them as a wave offering before ADONAI.
Vayikra,8,28,Moshe took them out of their hands and made them go up in smoke on the altar on top of the burnt offering; they were a consecration offering giving a fragrant aroma; an offering made by fire to ADONAI.
Vayikra,8,29,"Moshe took the breast and waved it as a wave offering before ADONAI; it was Moshe’s portion of the ram of consecration — as ADONAI had ordered Moshe.
(vii)"
Vayikra,8,30,"Moshe took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood which was on the altar and sprinkled it on Aharon and his clothing, and on his sons with him and their clothing, and consecrated Aharon and his clothing together with his sons and their clothing."
Vayikra,8,31,"Moshe said to Aharon and his sons, “Boil the meat at the door of the tent of meeting; and eat it there with the bread that is in the basket of consecration, as I ordered when I said that Aharon and his sons are to eat it."
Vayikra,8,32,Whatever is left over of the meat and bread you are to burn up completely. (Maftir)
Vayikra,8,33,"You are not to go out from the entrance to the tent of meeting for seven days, until the days of your consecration are over; since ADONAI will be consecrating you for seven days."
Vayikra,8,34,"He ordered done what has been done today, in order to make atonement for you."
Vayikra,8,35,"You are to remain at the entrance to the tent of meeting day and night for seven days, thereby obeying what ADONAI ordered done, so that you may not die. For this is what I was ordered.”"
Vayikra,8,36,"Aharon and his sons did all the things which ADONAI ordered through Moshe.

Vayikra,9,1,"On the eighth day, Moshe called Aharon, his sons and the leaders of Isra’el"
Vayikra,9,2,"and said to Aharon, “Take a male calf for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, both without defect, and offer them before ADONAI."
Vayikra,9,3,"Then tell the people of Isra’el, ‘Take a male goat for a sin offering and a calf and a lamb, both a year old and without defect, for a burnt offering"
Vayikra,9,4,"and an ox and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before ADONAI; also a grain offering mixed with olive oil — because today ADONAI is going to appear to you.’”"
Vayikra,9,5,"They brought what Moshe had ordered before the tent of meeting, and the whole community approached and stood before ADONAI."
Vayikra,9,6,"Moshe said, “This is what ADONAI has ordered you to do, so that the glory of ADONAI will appear to you.”"
Vayikra,9,7,"Moshe told Aharon, “Approach the altar, offer your sin offering and burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself and the people. Then present the offering of the people and make atonement for them, as ADONAI ordered.”"
Vayikra,9,8,So Aharon approached the altar and slaughtered the calf of the sin offering which was for himself.
Vayikra,9,9,The sons of Aharon presented the blood to him; and he dipped his finger in the blood and put it on the horns of the altar; then he poured out the blood at the base of the altar.
Vayikra,9,10,"But the fat, the kidneys and the covering of the liver of the sin offering he made go up in smoke on the altar, as ADONAI had ordered Moshe."
Vayikra,9,11,The meat and the skin were burned up completely outside the camp.
Vayikra,9,12,"Next he slaughtered the burnt offering; Aharon’s sons brought him the blood, and he splashed it against all sides of the altar."
Vayikra,9,13,"They brought him the burnt offering, piece by piece, and the head; and he made them go up in smoke on the altar."
Vayikra,9,14,He washed the inner organs and the lower parts of the legs and made them go up in smoke on top of the burnt offering on the altar.
Vayikra,9,15,"Then the people’s offering was presented. He took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people, slaughtered it and offered it for sin, like the earlier sin offering."
Vayikra,9,16,"The burnt offering was presented, and he offered it in the prescribed manner. (ii)"
Vayikra,9,17,"The grain offering was presented; he took a handful of it and made it go up in smoke on the altar, in addition to the morning’s burnt offering."
Vayikra,9,18,"He slaughtered the ox and the ram, the people’s sacrifice as peace offerings; Aharon’s sons brought him the blood, which he splashed against all sides of the altar"
Vayikra,9,19,"and the fat of the ox and of the ram — the fat tail, the fat which covers the inner organs, the kidneys and the covering of the liver."
Vayikra,9,20,"They put the fat on the breasts, and he made the fat go up in smoke on the altar."
Vayikra,9,21,"The breasts and right thigh Aharon waved as a wave offering before ADONAI, as Moshe had ordered."
Vayikra,9,22,"Aharon raised his hands toward the people, blessed them and came down from offering the sin offering, the burnt offering and the peace offerings."
Vayikra,9,23,"Moshe and Aharon entered the tent of meeting, came out and blessed the people. Then the glory of ADONAI appeared to all the people! (iii)"
Vayikra,9,24,"Fire came forth from the presence of ADONAI, consuming the burnt offering and the fat on the altar. When all the people saw it, they shouted and fell on their faces."
Vayikra,10,1,"But Nadav and Avihu, sons of Aharon, each took his censer, put fire in it, laid incense on it, and offered unauthorized fire before ADONAI, something he had not ordered them to do."
Vayikra,10,2,"At this, fire came forth from the presence of ADONAI and consumed them, so that they died in the presence of ADONAI."
Vayikra,10,3,"Moshe said to Aharon, “This is what ADONAI said:
‘Through those who are near me I will be consecrated,
and before all the people I will be glorified.’”
Aharon kept silent."
Vayikra,10,4,"Moshe called Misha’el and Eltzafan, sons of ‘Uzi’el Aharon’s uncle, and told them, “Come here, and carry your cousins away from in front of the sanctuary to a place outside the camp.”"
Vayikra,10,5,"They approached and carried them in their tunics out of the camp, as Moshe had said."
Vayikra,10,6,"Then Moshe told Aharon and his sons El‘azar and Itamar, “Don’t unbind your hair or tear your clothes in mourning, so that you won’t die and so that ADONAI won’t be angry with the entire community. Rather, let your kinsmen — the whole house of Isra’el — mourn, because of the destruction ADONAI brought about with his fire."
Vayikra,10,7,"Moreover, don’t leave the entrance to the tent of meeting, or you will die, because ADONAI’s anointing oil is on you.”"
Vayikra,10,8,ADONAI said to Aharon
Vayikra,10,9,"“Don’t drink any wine or other intoxicating liquor, neither you nor your sons with you, when you enter the tent of meeting, so that you will not die. This is to be a permanent regulation through all your generations"
Vayikra,10,10,"so that you will distinguish between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean"
Vayikra,10,11,"and so that you will teach the people of Isra’el all the laws ADONAI has told them through Moshe.”
(iv)"
Vayikra,10,12,"Moshe said to Aharon and to El‘azar and Itamar, his remaining sons, “Take the grain offering left from the offerings for ADONAI made by fire, and eat it without leaven next to the altar, because it is especially holy."
Vayikra,10,13,"Eat it in a holy place, because it is your and your sons’ share of the offerings for ADONAI made by fire; for this is what I have been ordered."
Vayikra,10,14,"The breast that was waved and the thigh that was raised you are to eat in a clean place — you, your sons and your daughters with you; for these are given as your and your children’s share of the sacrifices of the peace offerings presented by the people of Isra’el."
Vayikra,10,15,"They are to bring the raised thigh and the waved breast, along with the offerings of fat made by fire, and wave it as a wave offering before ADONAI; then it will belong to you and your descendants with you as your perpetual share, as ADONAI has ordered.”
(v)"
Vayikra,10,16,"Then Moshe carefully investigated what had happened to the goat of the sin offering and discovered that it had been burned up. He became angry with El‘azar and Itamar, the remaining sons of Aharon, and asked"
Vayikra,10,17,"“Why didn’t you eat the sin offering in the area of the sanctuary, since it is especially holy? He gave it to you to take away the guilt of the community, to make atonement for them before ADONAI."
Vayikra,10,18,"Look! Its blood wasn’t brought into the sanctuary! You should have eaten it there in the sanctuary, as I ordered.”"
Vayikra,10,19,"Aharon answered Moshe, “Even though they offered their sin offering and burnt offering today, things like these have happened to me! If I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have pleased ADONAI?”"
Vayikra,10,20,"On hearing this reply, Moshe was satisfied."
Vayikra,11,1,(vi) ADONAI said to Moshe and Aharon
Vayikra,11,2,"“Tell the people of Isra’el, ‘These are the living creatures which you may eat among all the land animals"
Vayikra,11,3,any that has a separate hoof which is completely divided and chews the cud — these animals you may eat.
Vayikra,11,4,"But you are not to eat those that only chew the cud or only have a separate hoof. For example, the camel, the coney and the hare are unclean for you, because they chew the cud but don’t have a separate hoof"
Vayikra,11,5,"But you are not to eat those that only chew the cud or only have a separate hoof. For example, the camel, the coney and the hare are unclean for you, because they chew the cud but don’t have a separate hoof"
Vayikra,11,6,"But you are not to eat those that only chew the cud or only have a separate hoof. For example, the camel, the coney and the hare are unclean for you, because they chew the cud but don’t have a separate hoof"
Vayikra,11,7,"while the pig is unclean for you, because, although it has a separate and completely divided hoof, it doesn’t chew the cud."
Vayikra,11,8,You are not to eat meat from these or touch their carcasses; they are unclean for you.
Vayikra,11,9,"“‘Of all the things that live in the water, you may eat these: anything in the water that has fins and scales, whether in seas or in rivers — these you may eat."
Vayikra,11,10,"But everything in the seas and rivers without both fins and scales, of all the small water-creatures and of all the living creatures in the water, is a detestable thing for you."
Vayikra,11,11,"Yes, these will be detestable for you — you are not to eat their meat, and you are to detest their carcasses."
Vayikra,11,12,Whatever lacks fins and scales in the water is a detestable thing for you.
Vayikra,11,13,"“‘The following creatures of the air are to be detestable for you — they are not to be eaten, they are a detestable thing: the eagle, the vulture, the osprey"

Vayikra,11,36,although a spring or cistern for collecting water remains clean. But anyone who touches one of their carcasses will become unclean.
Vayikra,11,37,"If any carcass-part of theirs falls on any kind of seed to be sown, it is clean"

Vayikra,12,3,"On the eighth day, the baby’s foreskin is to be circumcised."
Vayikra,12,4,She is to wait an additional thirty-three days to be purified from her blood; she is not to touch any holy thing or come into the sanctuary until the time of her purification is over.
Vayikra,12,5,"But if she gives birth to a girl, she will be unclean for two weeks, as in her niddah; and she is to wait another sixty-six days to be purified from her blood."
Vayikra,12,6,"“‘When the days of her purification are over, whether for a son or for a daughter, she is to bring a lamb in its first year for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or dove for a sin offering to the entrance of the tent of meeting, to the cohen."

Vayikra,13,1,ADONAI said to Moshe and Aharon
Vayikra,13,2,"“If someone develops on his skin a swelling, scab or bright spot which could develop into the disease tzara‘at, he is to be brought to Aharon the cohen or to one of his sons who are cohanim."
Vayikra,13,3,"The cohen is to examine the sore on his skin; if the hair in the sore has turned white, and the sore appears to go deep into the skin, it is tzara‘at, and after examining him the cohen is to declare him unclean."
Vayikra,13,4,"If the bright spot on his skin is white, but it does not appear to go deep into the skin, and its hair has not turned white, then the cohen is to isolate him for seven days."
Vayikra,13,5,"On the seventh day the cohen is to examine him again, and if the sore appears the same as before and has not spread on the skin, then the cohen is to isolate him for seven more days. (LY: ii)"
Vayikra,13,6,"On the seventh day the cohen is to examine him again, and if the sore has faded and hasn’t spread on the skin, then the cohen is to declare him clean — it is only a scab, so he is to wash his clothes and be clean."
Vayikra,13,7,"But if the scab spreads further on the skin after he has been examined by the cohen and declared clean, he is to let himself be examined yet again by the cohen."
Vayikra,13,8,"The cohen will examine him, and if he sees that the scab has spread on his skin, then the cohen will declare him unclean; it is tzara‘at."

Vayikra,13,11,"then it is chronic tzara‘at on his skin, and the cohen is to declare him unclean; he is not to isolate him, because it is already clear that he is unclean."
Vayikra,13,12,"If the tzara‘at breaks out all over the skin, so that, as far as the cohen can see, the person with tzara‘at has sores everywhere on his body, from his head to his feet"
Vayikra,13,13,"then the cohen is to examine him, and if he sees that the tzara‘at has covered his entire body, he is to pronounce the person with the sores clean — it has all turned white, and he is clean."
Vayikra,13,14,"But if one day inflamed flesh appears on him, he will be unclean."
Vayikra,13,15,The cohen will examine the inflamed flesh and declare him unclean; the inflamed flesh is unclean; it is tzara‘at.

Vayikra,13,31,"If the cohen examines the diseased crusted area and sees that it appears not to be deeper than the skin around it, and without any black hair in it, then the cohen is to isolate for seven days the person with the diseased crusted area."

Vayikra,13,50,The cohen is to examine the stain and isolate the article that has the infection for seven days.
Vayikra,13,51,"On the seventh day he is to examine the stain; if the stain has spread on the garment, threads, woven-in parts or leather, whatever its use, the infection is a contagious tzara‘at; the garment is unclean."

Vayikra,13,56,"If the cohen examines it and sees that the stain has faded after being washed, then he is to tear the stain out of the garment, leather, threads or woven-in parts. (LY: Maftir)"

Vayikra,14,1,ADONAI said to Moshe
Vayikra,14,2,“This is to be the law concerning the person afflicted with tzara‘at on the day of his purification. He is to be brought to the cohen
Vayikra,14,3,and the cohen is to go outside the camp and examine him there. If he sees that the tzara‘at sores have been healed in the afflicted person
Vayikra,14,4,"then the cohen will order that two living clean birds be taken for the one to be purified, along with cedar-wood, scarlet yarn and hyssop leaves."
Vayikra,14,5,The cohen is to order one of the birds slaughtered in a clay pot over running water.

Vayikra,14,38,he is to go out of the house to its door and seal up the house for seven days.
Vayikra,14,39,The cohen will come again on the seventh day and examine the house; if he sees that the infection has spread over its walls

Vayikra,24,3,"Outside the curtain of the testimony in the tent of meeting, Aharon is to arrange for the light to be kept burning always from evening until morning before ADONAI ; this is to be a permanent regulation through all your generations."
Vayikra,24,4,He is always to keep in order the lamps on the pure menorah before ADONAI.
Vayikra,24,5,"“You are to take fine flour and use it to bake twelve loaves, one gallon per loaf."
Vayikra,24,6,"Arrange them in two rows, six in a row, on the pure table before ADONAI."
Vayikra,24,7,Put frankincense with each row to be an offering made by fire to ADONAI in place of the bread and as a reminder of it.
Vayikra,24,8,"Regularly, every Shabbat, he is to arrange them before ADONAI ; they are from the people of Isra’el, as a covenant forever."
Vayikra,24,9,"They will belong to Aharon and his sons; and they are to eat them in a holy place; because for him they are, of the offerings for ADONAI made by fire, especially holy. This is a permanent law.”"
Vayikra,24,10,"There was a man who was the son of a woman of Isra’el and an Egyptian father. He went out among the people of Isra’el, and this son of a woman of Isra’el had a fight in the camp with a man of Isra’el"
Vayikra,24,11,"in the course of which the son of the woman of Isra’el uttered the Name [Yud-Heh-Vav-Heh] in a curse. So they brought him to Moshe. (His mother’s name was Shlomit the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.)"
Vayikra,24,12,They put him under guard until ADONAI would tell them what to do.
Vayikra,24,13,ADONAI said to Moshe
Vayikra,24,14,"“Take the man who cursed outside the camp, have everyone who heard him lay their hands on his head, and have the entire community stone him."
Vayikra,24,15,"Then tell the people of Isra’el, ‘Whoever curses his God will bear the consequences of his sin"
Vayikra,24,16,and whoever blasphemes the name of ADONAI must be put to death; the entire community must stone him. The foreigner as well as the citizen is to be put to death if he blasphemes the Name.
Vayikra,24,17,“‘Anyone who strikes another person and kills him must be put to death.
Vayikra,24,18,"Anyone who strikes an animal and kills it is to make restitution, life for life."
Vayikra,24,19,"If someone injures his neighbor, what he did is to be done to him "
Vayikra,24,20,"break for break, eye for eye, tooth for tooth — whatever injury he has caused the other person is to be rendered to him in return. (Maftir)"
Vayikra,24,21,"He who kills an animal is to make restitution, but he who kills another person is to be put to death."
Vayikra,24,22,"You are to apply the same standard of judgment to the foreigner as to the citizen, because I am ADONAI your God.”"
Vayikra,24,23,"So Moshe spoke to the people of Isra’el, and they took the man who had cursed outside the camp and stoned him to death. Thus the people of Isra’el did as ADONAI had ordered Moshe.

Vayikra,25,1,ADONAI spoke to Moshe on Mount Sinai; he said
Vayikra,25,2,"“Tell the people of Isra’el, ‘When you enter the land I am giving you, the land itself is to observe a Shabbat rest for ADONAI."
Vayikra,25,3,Six years you will sow your field; six years you will prune your grapevines and gather their produce.
Vayikra,25,4,"But in the seventh year is to be a Shabbat of complete rest for the land, a Shabbat for ADONAI; you will neither sow your field nor prune your grapevines."
Vayikra,25,5,"You are not to harvest what grows by itself from the seeds left by your previous harvest, and you are not to gather the grapes of your untended vine; it is to be a year of complete rest for the land."
Vayikra,25,6,"But what the land produces during the year of Shabbat will be food for all of you — you, your servant, your maid, your employee, anyone living near you"
Vayikra,25,7,your livestock and the wild animals on your land; everything the land produces may be used for food.
Vayikra,25,8,"“‘You are to count seven Shabbats of years, seven times seven years, that is, forty-nine years."
Vayikra,25,9,"Then, on the tenth day of the seventh month, on Yom-Kippur, you are to sound a blast on the shofar; you are to sound the shofar all through your land"
Vayikra,25,10,"and you are to consecrate the fiftieth year, proclaiming freedom throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It will be a yovel for you; you will return everyone to the land he owns, and everyone is to return to his family."
Vayikra,25,11,"That fiftieth year will be a yovel for you; in that year you are not to sow, harvest what grows by itself or gather the grapes of untended vines"
Vayikra,25,12,because it is a yovel. It will be holy for you; whatever the fields produce will be food for all of you.
Vayikra,25,13,"In this year of yovel, every one of you is to return to the land he owns.
(LY: ii)"
Vayikra,25,14,"“‘If you sell anything to your neighbor or buy anything from him, neither of you is to exploit the other."
Vayikra,25,15,"Rather, you are to take into account the number of years after the yovel when you buy land from your neighbor, and he is to sell to you according to the number of years crops will be raised."
Vayikra,25,16,"If the number of years remaining is large, you will raise the price; if few years remain, you will lower it; because what he is really selling you is the number of crops to be produced."
Vayikra,25,17,"Thus you are not to take advantage of each other, but you are to fear your God; for I am ADONAI your God."
Vayikra,25,18,"“‘Rather, you are to keep my regulations and rulings and act accordingly. If you do, you will live securely in the land. (RY: ii, LY: iii)"
Vayikra,25,19,"The land will yield its produce, you will eat until you have enough, and you will live there securely."
Vayikra,25,20,"“‘If you ask, “If we aren’t allowed to sow seed or harvest what our land produces, what are we going to eat the seventh year?”"
Vayikra,25,21,"then I will order my blessing on you during the sixth year, so that the land brings forth enough produce for all three years."
Vayikra,25,22,"The eighth year you will sow seed but eat the the old, stored produce until the ninth year; that is, until the produce of the eighth year comes in, you will eat the old, stored food."
Vayikra,25,23,"“‘The land is not to be sold in perpetuity, because the land belongs to me — you are only foreigners and temporary residents with me."
Vayikra,25,24,"Therefore, when you sell your property, you must include the right of redemption. (LY: iv)"
Vayikra,25,25,"That is, if one of you becomes poor and sells some of his property, his next-of-kin can come and buy back what his relative sold."
Vayikra,25,26,If the seller has no one to redeem it but becomes rich enough to redeem it himself
Vayikra,25,27,"he will calculate the number of years the land was sold for, refund the excess to its buyer, and return to his property."
Vayikra,25,28,"If he hasn’t sufficient means to get it back himself, then what he sold will remain in the hands of the buyer until the year of yovel; in the yovel the buyer will vacate it and the seller return to his property.
(RY: iii, LY: v)"
Vayikra,25,29,"“‘If someone sells a dwelling in a walled city, he has one year after the date of sale in which to redeem it. For a full year he will have the right of redemption"
Vayikra,25,30,"but if he has not redeemed the dwelling in the walled city within the year, then title in perpetuity passes to the buyer through all his generations; it will not revert in the yovel."
Vayikra,25,31,"However, houses in villages not surrounded by walls are to be dealt with like the fields in the countryside — they may be redeemed [before the yovel], and they revert in the yovel."
Vayikra,25,32,"“‘Concerning the cities of the L’vi’im and the houses in the cities they possess, the L’vi’im are to have a permanent right of redemption."
Vayikra,25,33,"If someone purchases a house from one of the L’vi’im, then the house he sold in the city where he owns property will still revert to him in the yovel; because the houses in the cities of the L’vi’im are their tribe’s possession among the people of Isra’el."
Vayikra,25,34,"The fields in the open land around their cities may not be sold, because that is their permanent possession."
Vayikra,25,35,"“‘If a member of your people has become poor, so that he can’t support himself among you, you are to assist him as you would a foreigner or a temporary resident, so that he can continue living with you."
Vayikra,25,36,"Do not charge him interest or otherwise profit from him, but fear your God, so that your brother can continue living with you."
Vayikra,25,37,Do not take interest when you loan him money or take a profit when you sell him food.
Vayikra,25,38,"I am ADONAI your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt in order to give you the land of Kena‘an and be your God.
(RY: iv, LY: vi)"
Vayikra,25,39,"“‘If a member of your people has become poor among you and sells himself to you, do not make him do the work of a slave."
Vayikra,25,40,"Rather, you are to treat him like an employee or a tenant; he will work for you until the year of yovel."
Vayikra,25,41,"Then he will leave you, he and his children with him, and return to his own family and regain possession of his ancestral land."
Vayikra,25,42,"For they are my slaves, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt; therefore they are not to be sold as slaves."
Vayikra,25,43,"Do not treat him harshly, but fear your God."
Vayikra,25,44,“‘Concerning the men and women you may have as slaves: you are to buy men- and women-slaves from the nations surrounding you.
Vayikra,25,45,You may also buy the children of foreigners living with you and members of their families born in your land; you may own these.
Vayikra,25,46,"You may also bequeath them to your children to own; from these groups you may take your slaves forever. But as far as your brothers the people of Isra’el are concerned, you are not to treat each other harshly.
(LY: vii)"
Vayikra,25,47,"“‘If a foreigner living with you has grown rich, and a member of your people has become poor and sells himself to this foreigner living with you or to a member of the foreigner’s family"
Vayikra,25,48,he may be redeemed after he has been sold. One of his brothers may redeem him
Vayikra,25,49,"or his uncle or his uncle’s son may redeem him; or any near relative of his may redeem him; or, if he becomes rich, he may redeem himself."
Vayikra,25,50,He will calculate with the person who bought him the time from the year he sold himself to him to the year of yovel; and the amount to be paid will be according to the number of years and his time at an employee’s wage.
Vayikra,25,51,"If many years remain, according to them will he refund the amount for his redemption from the amount he was bought for."
Vayikra,25,52,"If there remain only a few years until the year of yovel, then he will calculate with him; according to his years will he refund the amount for his redemption."
Vayikra,25,53,He will be like a worker hired year by year. You will see to it that he is not treated harshly.
Vayikra,25,54,"“‘If he has not been redeemed by any of these procedures, nevertheless he will go free in the year of yovel — he and his children with him. (LY: Maftir)"
Vayikra,25,55,For to me the people of Isra’el are slaves; they are my slaves whom I brought out of the land of Egypt; I am ADONAI your God.
Vayikra,26,1,"“‘You are not to make yourselves any idols, erect a carved statue or a standing-stone, or place any carved stone anywhere in your land in order to bow down to it. I am ADONAI your God."

Vayikra,26,4,"then I will provide the rain you need in its season, the land will yield its produce, and the trees in the field will yield their fruit."

Vayikra,26,6,“‘I will give shalom in the land — you will lie down to sleep unafraid of anyone. I will rid the land of wild animals. The sword will not go through your land.

Vayikra,26,8,"Five of you will chase a hundred, and a hundred of you will chase ten thousand — your enemies will fall before your sword."
Vayikra,26,9,"“‘I will turn toward you, make you productive, increase your numbers and uphold my covenant with you. (RY: v, LY: iii)"
Vayikra,26,10,You will eat all you want from last year’s harvest and throw out what remains of the old to make room for the new.

Vayikra,26,15,"if you loathe my regulations and reject my rulings, in order not to obey all my mitzvot but cancel my covenant"
Vayikra,26,16,"then I, for my part, will do this to you: I will bring terror upon you — wasting disease and chronic fever to dim your sight and sap your strength. You will sow your seed for nothing, because your enemies will eat the crops."
Vayikra,26,17,"I will set my face against you — your enemies will defeat you, those who hate you will hound you, and you will flee when no one is pursuing you."
Vayikra,26,18,"If these things don’t make you listen to me, then I will discipline you seven times over for your sins."
Vayikra,26,19,"I will break the pride you have in your own power. I will make your sky like iron, your soil like bronze "
Vayikra,26,20,"you will spend your strength in vain, because the land will not yield its produce or the trees in the field their fruit."
Vayikra,26,21,"“‘Yes, if you go against me and don’t listen to me, I will increase your calamities sevenfold, according to your sins."
Vayikra,26,22,"I will send wild animals among you; they will rob you of your children, destroy your livestock and reduce your numbers, until your roads are deserted."
Vayikra,26,23,"“‘If, in spite of all this, you refuse my correction and still go against me"
Vayikra,26,24,"then I too will go against you; and I, yes I, will strike you seven times over for your sins."
Vayikra,26,25,"I will bring a sword against you which will execute the vengeance of the covenant. You will be huddled inside your cities, I will send sickness among you, and you will be handed over to the power of the enemy."
Vayikra,26,26,"I will cut off your supply of bread, so that ten women will bake your bread in one oven and dole out your bread by weight, and you will eat but not be satisfied."
Vayikra,26,27,"“‘And if, for all this, you still will not listen to me, but go against me"
Vayikra,26,28,"then I will go against you furiously, and I also will chastise you yet seven times more for your sins."
Vayikra,26,29,"You will eat the flesh of your own sons, you will eat the flesh of your own daughters."
Vayikra,26,30,"I will destroy your high places, cut down your pillars for sun-worship, and throw your carcasses on the carcasses of your idols; and I will detest you."
Vayikra,26,31,"I will lay waste to your cities and make your sanctuaries desolate, so as not to smell your fragrant aromas."
Vayikra,26,32,"I will desolate the land, so that your enemies living in it will be astounded by it."
Vayikra,26,33,"You I will disperse among the nations, and I will draw out the sword in pursuit after you; your land will be a desolation and your cities a wasteland."
Vayikra,26,34,"Then, at last, the land will be paid its Shabbats. As long as it lies desolate and you are in the lands of your enemies, the land will rest and be repaid its Shabbats."
Vayikra,26,35,"Yes, as long as it lies desolate it will have rest, the rest it did not have during your Shabbats, when you lived there."
Vayikra,26,36,"As for those of you who are left, I will fill their hearts with anxiety in the lands of their enemies. The sound of a driven leaf will frighten them, so that they will flee as one flees from the sword and fall when no one is pursuing."
Vayikra,26,37,"Yes, with no one pursuing they will stumble over each other as if fleeing the sword — you will have no power to stand before your enemies."
Vayikra,26,38,And among the nations you will perish; the land of your enemies will devour you.
Vayikra,26,39,Those of you who remain will pine away in the lands of your enemies from guilt over your misdeeds and those of your ancestors.
Vayikra,26,40,Then they will confess their misdeeds and those of their ancestors which they committed against me in their rebellion; they will admit that they went against me.
Vayikra,26,41,"At that time I will be going against them, bringing them into the lands of their enemies. But if their uncircumcised hearts will grow humble, and they are paid the punishment for their misdeeds"
Vayikra,26,42,"then I will remember my covenant with Ya‘akov, also my covenant with Yitz’chak and my covenant with Avraham; and I will remember the land."
Vayikra,26,43,"For the land will lie abandoned without them, and it will be paid its Shabbats while it lies desolate without them; and they will be paid the punishment for their misdeeds, because they rejected my rulings and loathed my regulations."
Vayikra,26,44,"Yet, in spite of all that, I will not reject them when they are in the lands of their enemies, nor will I loathe them to the point of utterly destroying them and thus break my covenant with them, because I am ADONAI their God."
Vayikra,26,45,"Rather, for their sakes, I will remember the covenant of their ancestors whom I brought out of the land of Egypt — with the nations watching — so that I might be their God; I am ADONAI.’”"
Vayikra,26,46,"These are the laws, rulings and teachings that ADONAI himself gave to the people of Isra’el on Mount Sinai through Moshe."
Vayikra,27,1,(RY: vi; LY: iv) ADONAI said to Moshe
Vayikra,27,2,"“Tell the people of Isra’el, ‘If someone makes a clearly defined vow to ADONAI to give him an amount equal to the value of a human being"
Vayikra,27,3,"the value you are to assign to a man between the ages of twenty and sixty years is to be fifty shekels of silver [one-and-a-quarter pounds], with the sanctuary shekel being the standard"
Vayikra,27,4,"if a woman, thirty shekels."
Vayikra,27,5,"If it is a child five to twenty years old, assign a value of twenty shekels for a boy and ten for a girl"
Vayikra,27,6,"if a baby one month to five years of age, five shekels for a boy and three for a girl"
Vayikra,27,7,"if a person past sixty, fifteen shekels for a man and ten for a woman."
Vayikra,27,8,"If the person is too poor to be evaluated, set him before the cohen, who will assign him a value in keeping with the means of the person who made the vow."
Vayikra,27,9,"“‘If the vow is for the value of an animal of the kind used when people bring an offering to ADONAI, all that a person gives of such animals to ADONAI will be holy."
Vayikra,27,10,"He is not to exchange or replace it by substituting a good animal for a bad one or vice versa; if he does make such a substitution, both the original animal and the one replacing it will be holy."
Vayikra,27,11,"If the animal is an unclean one, such as may not be used in an offering to ADONAI, he must set it before the cohen"
Vayikra,27,12,and the cohen is to set a value on it in relation to its good and bad points; the value set by you the cohen will stand.
Vayikra,27,13,"But if the person making the vow wishes to redeem the animal, he must add one-fifth to your valuation."
Vayikra,27,14,"“‘When a person consecrates his house to be holy for ADONAI, the cohen is to set a value on it in relation to its good and bad points; the value set by the cohen will stand."
Vayikra,27,15,"If the consecrator wishes to redeem his house, he must add one-fifth to the value you have set on it; and it will revert to him.
(RY: vii, LY: v)"
Vayikra,27,16,"“‘If a person consecrates to ADONAI part of a field belonging to his tribe’s possession, you are to value it according to its production, with five bushels of barley being valued at fifty shekels of silver [one-and-a-quarter pounds]."
Vayikra,27,17,"If he consecrates his field during the year of yovel, this valuation will stand."
Vayikra,27,18,"But if he consecrates his field after the yovel, then the cohen is to calculate the price according to the years remaining till the next yovel, with a corresponding reduction from your valuation."
Vayikra,27,19,"If the one consecrating the field wishes to redeem it, he must add one-fifth to your valuation, and the field will be set aside to revert to him."
Vayikra,27,20,"If the seller does not wish to redeem the field, or if [the treasurer for the cohanim] has already sold the field to someone else, it can no longer be redeemed."
Vayikra,27,21,"But when the purchaser has to vacate the field in the yovel, it will become holy to ADONAI, like a field unconditionally consecrated; it will belong to the cohanim.
(LY: vi)"
Vayikra,27,22,"“‘If he consecrates to ADONAI a field which he has bought, a field which is not part of his tribe’s possession"
Vayikra,27,23,then the cohen is to calculate its value according to the years remaining until the year of yovel; and the man will on that same day pay this amount; since it is holy to ADONAI.
Vayikra,27,24,"In the year of yovel the field will revert to the person from whom it was bought, that is, to the person to whose tribal possession it belongs."
Vayikra,27,25,"“‘All your valuations are to be according to the sanctuary shekel [two-fifths of an ounce], twenty gerahs to the shekel."
Vayikra,27,26,"“‘However, the firstborn among animals, since it is already born as a firstborn for ADONAI, no one can consecrate — neither ox nor sheep — since it belongs to ADONAI already."
Vayikra,27,27,"But if it is an unclean animal, he may redeem it at the price at which you value it and add one-fifth; or if he does not redeem it, it is to be sold at the price at which you value it."
Vayikra,27,28,"However, nothing consecrated unconditionally which a person may consecrate to ADONAI out of all he owns — person, animal or field he possesses — is to be sold or redeemed; because everything consecrated unconditionally is especially holy to ADONAI. (LY: vii)"
Vayikra,27,29,"No person who has been sentenced to die, and thus unconditionally consecrated, can be redeemed; he must be put to death."
Vayikra,27,30,"“‘All the tenth given from the land, whether from planted seed or fruit from trees, belongs to ADONAI; it is holy to ADONAI."
Vayikra,27,31,"If someone wants to redeem any of his tenth, he must add to it one-fifth.
(Maftir)"
Vayikra,27,32,"“‘All the tenth from the herd or the flock, whatever passes under the shepherd’s crook, the tenth one will be holy to ADONAI."
Vayikra,27,33,"The owner is not to inquire whether the animal is good or bad, and he cannot exchange it; if he does exchange it, both it and the one he substituted for it will be holy; it cannot be redeemed.’”"
Vayikra,27,34,"These are the mitzvot which ADONAI gave to Moshe for the people of Isra’el on Mount Sinai.
