'Ezra,1,1,"In the first year of Koresh king of Persia, in order for the word of ADONAI prophesied by Yirmeyahu to be fulfilled, ADONAI stirred up the spirit of Koresh king of Persia to make a proclamation throughout his whole kingdom, which he also put in writing, as follows"
'Ezra,1,2,"“Here is what Koresh king of Persia says: ADONAI, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms on earth; and he has charged me to build him a house in Yerushalayim, in Y’hudah."
'Ezra,1,3,"Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God be with him! He may go up to Yerushalayim, in Y’hudah, and build the house of ADONAI the God of Isra’el, the God who is in Yerushalayim."
'Ezra,1,4,"Let every survivor, no matter where he lives, be helped by his neighbors with silver, gold, goods and animals, in addition to the voluntary offering for the house of God in Yerushalayim.”"
'Ezra,1,5,"The heads of fathers’ clans in Y’hudah and Binyamin, along with the cohanim, the L’vi’im, and indeed all whose spirit God had stirred, set out to go up and rebuild the house of ADONAI in Yerushalayim."
'Ezra,1,6,"All their neighbors supported them by giving them articles of silver, gold, goods, animals, and valuables, besides all their voluntary offerings."
'Ezra,1,7,"In addition, Koresh the king brought out the vessels from the house of ADONAI which N’vukhadnetzar had taken from Yerushalayim and put in the house of his god."
'Ezra,1,8,Koresh king of Persia had Mitr’dat the treasurer bring them out and make an inventory of them for Sheshbatzar the prince of Y’hudah.
'Ezra,1,9,The list was as follows
'Ezra,2,1,"Here is a list of the people of the province who had been exiled, carried off to Bavel by N’vukhadnetzar king of Bavel, but who later returned from exile and went up to Yerushalayim and Y’hudah, each to his own city"
'Ezra,2,2,"they went with Z’rubavel, Yeshua, Nechemyah, S’rayah, Re‘elyah, Mordekhai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rechum and Ba‘anah.

'Ezra,3,1,"When the seventh month arrived, after the people of Isra’el had resettled in the towns, the people gathered with one accord in Yerushalayim."
'Ezra,3,2,"Then Yeshua the son of Yotzadak with his fellow cohanim, and Z’rubavel the son of Sh’alti’el with his kinsmen, organized rebuilding the altar of the God of Isra’el; so that they could offer burnt offerings on it, as is written in the Torah of Moshe the man of God."
'Ezra,3,3,"They set up the altar on its former bases. Despite feeling threatened by the peoples of the [surrounding] countries; they offered on it burnt offerings to ADONAI, the morning and evening burnt offerings."
'Ezra,3,4,"They observed the festival of Sukkot as written, offering daily the number of burnt offerings prescribed for each day"
'Ezra,3,5,"and afterwards the regular burnt offering, the offerings for Rosh-Hodesh and those for all the designated times set apart for ADONAI, as well as those of everyone who volunteered a voluntary offering to ADONAI."
'Ezra,3,6,"From the first day of the seventh month, they began offering burnt offerings to ADONAI, even though the foundation of ADONAI’s temple had not yet been laid."
'Ezra,3,7,"They also gave money for the stone-workers and carpenters, as well as food, drink and olive oil for the people of Tzidon and Tzor bringing cedar logs from the L’vanon to the sea and on to Yafo, in accordance with the authorization granted by Koresh king of Persia."
'Ezra,3,8,"In the second year after their arrival at the house of God in Yerushalayim, in the second month, Z’rubavel the son of Sh’alti’el, Yeshua the son of Yotzadak, the rest of their kinsmen the cohanim and L’vi’im, and all who had come out of exile to Yerushalayim began the project. They appointed the L’vi’im aged twenty and up to direct work in the house of ADONAI."
'Ezra,3,9,"Yeshua and his sons and brothers, Kadmi’el and his sons, and Y’hudah’s sons together directed the workers in the house of God; also the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their kinsmen the L’vi’im."
'Ezra,3,10,"When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of ADONAI, the cohanim in their robes, with trumpets, and the L’vi’im the sons of Asaf, with cymbals, took their places to praise ADONAI, as David king of Isra’el had instructed."
'Ezra,3,11,"They sang antiphonally, praising and giving “thanks to ADONAI, for he is good, for his grace continues forever” toward Isra’el. All the people raised a great shout of praise to ADONAI, because the foundation of the house of ADONAI had been laid."
'Ezra,3,12,"But many of the cohanim, L’vi’im and heads of fathers’ clans, the old men who had seen the first house standing on its foundation, wept out loud when they saw this house; while others shouted out loud for joy "
'Ezra,3,13,so that the people couldn’t distinguish the noise of the joyful shouting from the noise of the people’s weeping; for the people were shouting so loudly that the noise could be heard at a great distance.
'Ezra,4,1,When the enemies of Y’hudah and Binyamin heard that the people from the exile were building a temple to ADONAI the God of Isra’el
'Ezra,4,2,"they approached Z’rubavel and the heads of fathers’ clans and said to them, “Let us build along with you; for we seek your God, just as you do; and we have been sacrificing to him since the time of Esar-Hadon king of Ashur, who brought us here.”"
'Ezra,4,3,"But Z’rubavel, Yeshua and the rest of the heads of fathers’ clans in Isra’el answered them, “You and we have nothing in common that you should join us in building a house for our God. We will build by ourselves for ADONAI the God of Isra’el, as Koresh king of Persia ordered us to do.”"
'Ezra,4,4,"Then the people of the land began discouraging the people of Y’hudah, in order to make them afraid to build."
'Ezra,4,5,They also bribed officials to frustrate their plan throughout the lifetime of Koresh king of Persia and on into the reign of Daryavesh king of Persia.
'Ezra,4,6,"During the reign of Achashverosh, at the beginning of his reign, they brought a charge in writing against the people living in Y’hudah and Yerushalayim."
'Ezra,4,7,"Then, during the time of Artach’shashta, Bishlam, Mitr’dat, Tav’el and their other colleagues wrote Artach’shashta; the letter was written in Aramaic, using Aramaic script."
'Ezra,4,8,Rechum the district governor and Shimshai the secretary wrote a letter against Yerushalayim to Artach’shashta the king as follows
'Ezra,4,9,"“From Rechum the district governor, Shimshai the secretary, their other colleagues, the judges, the officials, the Dina’im, the Afarsat’khim, the Tarp’lim, the Afarsim, the Ark’vim, the Bavlim, the Shushan’kayim, the Dehayim, the ‘Elma’im"
'Ezra,4,10,"the other nations whom the great and noble Asnapar deported and settled in Shomron, and the others who remain in the country beyond the [Euphrates] River.”"
'Ezra,4,11,"(This is the text of the letter they sent him.)
“To Artach’shashta the king from his servants the people beyond the River"
'Ezra,4,12,“Let the king know that the Judeans who left you to come to us in Yerushalayim are building this rebellious and wicked city. They have finished the walls and are now digging the foundations.
'Ezra,4,13,"So let the king know that if this city is rebuilt and the walls are finished, they will refuse to pay tribute, tax or toll; and this will reduce the royal revenue."
'Ezra,4,14,"Now, because we eat the king’s salt, and it is not right for us to see the king dishonored, we therefore are sending to inform the king"
'Ezra,4,15,"so that a search can be made in the archives of your ancestors; in these archives you will find and ascertain that this city is indeed a rebellious city, the bane of kings and provinces, and that sedition has been fostered there since ancient times — which is why this city was destroyed."
'Ezra,4,16,"We submit to the king that if this city is rebuilt and the walls are finished, you will soon lose possession of all territories beyond the River.”"
'Ezra,4,17,"The king sent this answer:
“To Rechum the district governor, Shimshai the secretary, their other colleagues living in Shomron, and the rest beyond the River:
“Shalom!"
'Ezra,4,18,“The letter you sent us has now been translated for me.
'Ezra,4,19,"I ordered a search made, and it was found that this city has a long history of revolt against kings, that rebellion and sedition have been fostered there"
'Ezra,4,20,"also that there have been powerful kings over Yerushalayim who ruled all the territory beyond the River; and tribute, taxes and tolls were paid to them."
'Ezra,4,21,"“So now, order that these men stop work and that this city not be rebuilt until I order it."
'Ezra,4,22,"Take care not to neglect your duty; otherwise the harm may increase, to the damage of the king.”"
'Ezra,4,23,"When the text of King Artach’shashta’s letter was read before Rechum, Shimshai the secretary and their colleagues, they hurried to Yerushalayim to the Judeans and stopped their work by force of arms."
'Ezra,4,24,So the work on the house of God in Yerushalayim ceased; it remained at a standstill until the second year of the reign of Daryavesh king of Persia.
'Ezra,5,1,The prophets Hagai and Z’kharyah the son of ‘Iddo prophesied to the Judeans in Yerushalayim and Y’hudah; they prophesied to them in the name of the God of Isra’el.
'Ezra,5,2,"Then Z’rubavel the son of Sh’alti’el and Yeshua the son of Yotzadak began rebuilding the house of God in Yerushalayim; with them were the prophets of God, helping them."
'Ezra,5,3,"No sooner had they begun, when Tatnai the governor of the territory beyond the [Euphrates] River, Sh’tar-Boznai and their colleagues came and asked them, “Who gave you permission to rebuild this house and finish this wall?"
'Ezra,5,4,What are the names of the men putting up this building?”
'Ezra,5,5,"But the eye of their God was on the leaders of the Judeans, so they didn’t stop them until the matter could come before Daryavesh and a reply in writing be received."
'Ezra,5,6,"Here is the text of the letter which Tatnai the governor of the territory beyond the River, Sh’tar-Boznai and their fellow officials beyond the River sent to Daryavesh the king"
'Ezra,5,7,"they sent him a letter in which it was written:
“To Daryavesh the king,
“Complete shalom!”"
'Ezra,5,8,"“Let the king know that we went to the province of Y’hudah, to the house of the great God. It is being rebuilt with large stones, and timber is being set in the walls. This work is being done energetically, and it is making good progress under the direction"
'Ezra,5,9,"of their leaders. We asked them, ‘Who gave you permission to rebuild this house and finish this wall?’"
'Ezra,5,10,"We also asked them their names, so that we could write you the names of the men in charge of them."
'Ezra,5,11,"“They gave us this answer: ‘We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth. We are rebuilding the house that was built many years ago, built and finished by a great king of Isra’el."
'Ezra,5,12,"But because our ancestors provoked the God of heaven, he handed them over to N’vukhadnetzar king of Bavel, the Kasdi; he destroyed this house and carried the people off to Bavel."
'Ezra,5,13,"But in the first year of Koresh king of Bavel, Koresh the king gave authorization to rebuild this house of God."
'Ezra,5,14,"Moreover, the gold and silver articles belonging to the house of God, which N’vukhadnetzar had removed from the temple in Yerushalayim and brought to the temple of Bavel, Koresh the king took out of the temple in Bavel; they were turned over to a man named Sheshbatzar, whom he had appointed governor."
'Ezra,5,15,"He said to him, “Take these articles, go, put them in the temple in Yerushalayim, and let the house of God be rebuilt on its original site.”"
'Ezra,5,16,"So this same Sheshbatzar came and laid the foundations of the house of God in Yerushalayim; it has been under construction ever since, and it isn’t finished yet."
'Ezra,5,17,"“‘Now therefore, if it seems good to the king, let a search be made in the royal treasury there in Bavel to determine whether a decree was issued by Koresh the king to rebuild this house of God in Yerushalayim; and let the king send us his decision concerning this matter.’”"
'Ezra,6,1,"Daryavesh the king issued an order; and search was made in the archives building, where treasures were stored in Bavel"
'Ezra,6,2,"and there was found at Achm’ta, in the palace which is in the province of Media, a scroll on which was written the following:
“Memorandum"
'Ezra,6,3,"“In the first year of Koresh the king, Koresh the king issued this decree: ‘Concerning the house of God in Yerushalayim, let the house be rebuilt, the place where they offer sacrifices; and let its foundations be firmly laid. Its height is to be ninety feet and its breadth ninety feet"
'Ezra,6,4,with three rows of large stones and one row of new timber. The expenses are to be charged to the king’s treasury.
'Ezra,6,5,"Also let the gold and silver articles belonging to the house of God, which N’vukhadnetzar removed from the temple at Yerushalayim and brought to Bavel, be restored and returned to the temple in Yerushalayim, each item to its place; and you are to put them in the house of God.’"
'Ezra,6,6,"“Therefore, Tatnai governor of the territory beyond the River, Sh’tar-Boznai and your colleagues the officials beyond the River, stay away from there!"
'Ezra,6,7,Let the work of this house of God alone. Let the governor of the Judeans and the leaders of the Judeans rebuild this house of God on its site.
'Ezra,6,8,"“Moreover, I herewith issue this order concerning how you are to assist these leaders of the Judeans in rebuilding this house of God: the expenses of these men are to be defrayed promptly from the royal funds, from the taxes collected beyond the River, so that the work can continue."
'Ezra,6,9,"Whatever they need — young bulls, rams and lambs — for burnt offerings to the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine and olive oil, according to what the cohanim in Yerushalayim say, is to be given them daily without fail"
'Ezra,6,10,so that they can offer sacrifices with a fragrant aroma to the God of heaven and pray for the life of the king and his sons.
'Ezra,6,11,"“I also order that if anyone defies this order, a beam is to be pulled from his house; and he is to be lifted up and impaled on it. His house is to be reduced to rubble."
'Ezra,6,12,"May the God who has caused his name to be there overthrow any king or people that tries to defy it and destroy this house of God in Yerushalayim.
“I, Daryavesh, have issued this order. Let it be carried out to the letter.”"
'Ezra,6,13,"Then Tatnai the governor of the territory beyond the [Euphrates] River, Sh’tar-Boznai and their colleagues obeyed strictly; because Daryavesh the king had given the order to do so."
'Ezra,6,14,"The leaders of the Judeans made good progress with the rebuilding, thanks to the prophesying of Hagai the prophet and Z’kharyah the son of ‘Iddo. They kept building until they were finished, in keeping with the command of the God of Isra’el and in accordance with the order of Koresh, Daryavesh and Artach’shashta king of Persia."
'Ezra,6,15,"This house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of Daryavesh the king."
'Ezra,6,16,"The people of Isra’el, the cohanim, the L’vi’im and the other people from the exile joyfully dedicated this house of God."
'Ezra,6,17,"At the dedication of this house of God they offered 100 young bulls, 200 rams, 400 lambs, and, as a sin offering for all Isra’el, twelve male goats, corresponding to the number of the tribes of Isra’el."
'Ezra,6,18,"Then they installed the cohanim in their divisions and the L’vi’im in their orders for the service of God in Yerushalayim, as written in the book of Moshe."
'Ezra,6,19,The people from the exile kept Pesach on the fourteenth day of the first month.
'Ezra,6,20,For the cohanim and L’vi’im had purified themselves together; all of them were pure. So they slaughtered the Pesach lambs for all the people from the exile and for their kinsmen the cohanim and for themselves.
'Ezra,6,21,"The people of Isra’el who had returned from the exile and all those who had renounced the filthy practices of the nations living in the land in order to seek ADONAI the God of Isra’el, ate [the Pesach lamb]"
'Ezra,6,22,"and joyfully kept the feast of matzah for seven days; for ADONAI had filled them with joy by turning the heart of the king of Ashur toward them, so that he assisted them in the work of the house of God, the God of Isra’el."
'Ezra,7,1,"After these events, during the reign of Artach’shashta king of Persia, ‘Ezra the son of S’rayah, the son of ‘Azaryah, the son of Hilkiyah"
'Ezra,7,2,"the son of Shalum, the son of Tzadok, the son of Achituv"
'Ezra,7,3,"the son of Amaryah, the son of ‘Azaryah, the son of M’rayot"
'Ezra,7,4,"the son of Z’rachyah, the son of ‘Uzi, the son of Buki"
'Ezra,7,5,"the son of Avishua, the son of Pinchas, the son of Eli‘ezer, the son of Aharon the cohen hagadol "
'Ezra,7,6,"this ‘Ezra went up from Bavel. He was a scribe, expert in the Torah of Moshe, which ADONAI the God of Isra’el had given; and the king granted him everything he asked for, since the hand of ADONAI his God was on him."
'Ezra,7,7,"In the seventh year of Artach’shashta the king, some of the people of Isra’el, and some of the cohanim, L’vi’im, singers, gatekeepers and temple servants went up to Yerushalayim."
'Ezra,7,8,[‘Ezra] arrived at Yerushalayim in the fifth month of the seventh year of the king.
'Ezra,7,9,"He began going up to Yerushalayim from Bavel on the first day of the first month and arrived on the first day of the fifth month, since the good hand of his God was on him."
'Ezra,7,10,For ‘Ezra had set his heart on studying and practicing the Torah of ADONAI and teaching Isra’el the laws and rulings.
'Ezra,7,11,"Here is the letter that King Artach’shashta gave ‘Ezra the cohen and Torah-teacher, the student of matters relating to ADONAI’s mitzvot and his laws for Isra’el"
'Ezra,7,12,"“From: Artach’shashta, king of kings
“To: ‘Ezra the cohen, scribe of the law of the God of heaven, etc.:
“Herewith"
'Ezra,7,13,"I decree that everyone in my realm who belongs to the people of Isra’el, including their cohanim and L’vi’im, who, of his own free will, chooses to go with you to Yerushalayim, should go."
'Ezra,7,14,"You are being sent by the king and his seven counselors to inquire how the law of your God, of which you have expert knowledge, is being applied in Y’hudah and Yerushalayim."
'Ezra,7,15,"You are also to bring with you the silver and gold which the king and his counselors have voluntarily offered to the God of Isra’el, whose dwelling is in Yerushalayim"
'Ezra,7,16,together with all the silver and gold you receive throughout the province of Bavel and the voluntary offerings of the people and the cohanim that have been offered willingly for the house of their God in Yerushalayim.
'Ezra,7,17,"“You are to spend this money carefully on young bulls, rams, and lambs, with their grain offerings and drink offerings; and offer them on the altar of the house of your God in Yerushalayim."
'Ezra,7,18,"Whatever seems good to you and your kinsmen to do with the rest of the silver and gold, do it according to the will of your God."
'Ezra,7,19,"“The articles given to you for the service of the house of your God, deliver to the God of Yerushalayim."
'Ezra,7,20,"“Whatever else may be needed for the house of your God that you have to supply, you may supply from the royal treasury."
'Ezra,7,21,"“I, Artach’shashta the king, herewith order all the treasurers in the territory beyond the [Euphrates] River to do carefully anything ‘Ezra the cohen, scribe of the law of the God of heaven, requires of you"
'Ezra,7,22,"up to three-and-a-third tons of silver, 500 bushels of wheat, 500 gallons of wine, 500 gallons of olive oil and unlimited amounts of salt."
'Ezra,7,23,Whatever is ordered by the God of heaven is to be performed exactly for the house of the God of heaven; for why should wrath come against the realm of the king and his sons?
'Ezra,7,24,"Moreover, we herewith proclaim to you that it will be illegal to impose tribute, taxes or tolls on any of the cohanim, L’vi’im, singers, gatekeepers, servants or laborers in this house of God."
'Ezra,7,25,"“And you, ‘Ezra, making use of the wisdom you have from your God, are to appoint magistrates and judges to judge all the people in the territory beyond the River, that is, all who know the laws of your God; and you are to teach those who don’t know them."
'Ezra,7,26,"Whoever refuses to obey the law of your God and the law of the king, let judgment be executed on him swiftly, whether it be death, banishment, confiscation of goods or imprisonment.”"
'Ezra,7,27,"Blessed be ADONAI, the God of our ancestors, who has put such a thing as this in the heart of the king, to restore the beauty of the house of ADONAI in Yerushalayim"
'Ezra,7,28,"and has extended mercy to me before the king and his counselors, and before all the king’s most powerful officials.
So I took courage, since the hand of ADONAI my God was on me, and I gathered together out of Isra’el key men to go up with me."
'Ezra,8,1,"These are the heads of their fathers’ clans, and this is the genealogy of those who went up with me from Bavel during the reign of Artach’shashta the king"

'Ezra,8,14,"of the descendants of Bigvai: ‘Utai and Zakur,
and with them 70 males."
'Ezra,8,15,"I assembled them by the river that runs to Ahava, and we camped there three days. I reviewed the people and the cohanim but found no L’vi’im there."
'Ezra,8,16,"So I sent for Eli‘ezer, Ari’el, Sh’ma‘yah, Elnatan, Yariv, Elnatan, Natan, Z’kharyah and Meshulam, who were leaders, and also for Yoyariv and Elnatan, who were men of discernment."
'Ezra,8,17,"I gave them instructions for Iddo, the leading man in a place called Kasifya, and told them what to say to Iddo and his brother, who were in charge of Kasifya, so that they would bring us men to minister in the house of our God."
'Ezra,8,18,"Since the good hand of our God was on us, they brought us Ish-Sekhel from the descendants of Machli the son of Levi, the son of Isra’el; Sherevyah with eighteen of his sons and kinsmen"
'Ezra,8,19,"Hashavyah, with Yesha‘yah, from the descendants of M’rari, and twenty of his kinsmen and their sons"
'Ezra,8,20,"and from the temple servants, whom David and the princes had assigned to serve the L’vi’im, two hundred temple servants, all recorded by name."
'Ezra,8,21,"Then, there at the Ahava River, I proclaimed a fast; so that we could humble ourselves before our God and ask a safe journey of him for ourselves, our little ones and all our possessions."
'Ezra,8,22,"For I would have been ashamed to ask the king for a detachment of soldiers and horsemen to protect us from enemies along the road, since we had said to the king, “The hand of our God is on all who seek him, for good; but his power and fury is against all who abandon him.”"
'Ezra,8,23,"So we fasted and asked our God for this, and he answered our prayer."
'Ezra,8,24,"Then I separated twelve of the chief cohanim, along with Sherevyah, Hashavyah and ten of their kinsmen."
'Ezra,8,25,"I weighed out to them the silver, the gold and the utensils for the house of our God contributed by the king, his counselors, his princes and all Isra’el present there."
'Ezra,8,26,"I weighed out and handed over to them twenty-one-and-a-half tons of silver, three-and-a-third tons of silver articles, three-and-a-third tons of gold"
'Ezra,8,27,"twenty gold bowls weighing twenty-one pounds, and two vessels of fine burnished bronze as precious as gold."
'Ezra,8,28,"Then I told them, “You are consecrated to ADONAI, the articles are holy, and the silver and gold are a voluntary offering for ADONAI the God of your ancestors."
'Ezra,8,29,"Guard them carefully, until you weigh them before the chief cohanim and L’vi’im and the leaders of the fathers’ clans in Yerushalayim, in the rooms of the house of ADONAI.”"
'Ezra,8,30,"So the cohanim and L’vi’im received the consignment of silver and gold and the articles to bring to Yerushalayim, to the house of our God."
'Ezra,8,31,"On the twelfth day of the first month, we left the Ahava River to go to Yerushalayim. The hand of our God was on us, and he protected us from enemies and surprise attacks along the road."
'Ezra,8,32,"In time, we arrived at Yerushalayim, where we rested for three days."
'Ezra,8,33,"On the fourth day, the silver, gold and articles were weighed in the house of our God and handed over to M’remot the son of Uriyah the cohen; with him was El‘azar the son of Pinchas; and with them were Yozavad the son of Yeshua and No‘adyah the son of Binui, who were L’vi’im."
'Ezra,8,34,"The entire consignment was numbered and weighed, and at the same time the total weight was recorded."
'Ezra,8,35,"The exiles who had returned from captivity offered burnt offerings to the God of Isra’el — twelve young bulls for all Isra’el, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and twelve male goats as a sin offering; all this was a burnt offering for ADONAI."
'Ezra,8,36,They also delivered the king’s orders to the king’s viceroys and governors beyond the [Euphrates] River; and these gave their support to the people and to the house of God.
'Ezra,9,1,"After these things had been done, the leaders approached me and said, “The people of Isra’el, the cohanim and the L’vi’im have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands and their disgusting practices — the Kena‘ani, Hitti, P’rizi, Y’vusi, ‘Amoni, Mo’avi, Egyptians and Emori."
'Ezra,9,2,"They have taken some of the women from these nations as wives for themselves and their sons, so that the holy seed has assimilated to the peoples of the lands; moreover, the officials and leaders have been the main offenders in this treachery.”"
'Ezra,9,3,"When I heard this, I tore my robe and tunic, pulled hair from my head and beard, and sat down in shock."
'Ezra,9,4,All who trembled at the words of the God of Isra’el assembled around me when confronted with the treachery of these exiles; and I sat there in shock until the evening offering.
'Ezra,9,5,"At the evening offering, with my cloak and tunic torn, I got up from afflicting myself, fell on my knees, spread out my hands to ADONAI my God"
'Ezra,9,6,"and said, “My God, I am ashamed. I blush to lift my face to you, my God! For our sins tower over our heads; our guilt reaches up to heaven."
'Ezra,9,7,"Since the times of our ancestors, we have been deeply guilty; and because of our sins, we, our kings and our cohanim have been handed over to the kings of the lands, to the sword, to exile, to pillage and to disgrace, as is the case today."
'Ezra,9,8,"Now, for a brief moment, ADONAI our God has shown us the favor of allowing a remnant to escape and giving us a secure foothold in his holy place, in order for God to make things look brighter to us and revive us a little in our slavery."
'Ezra,9,9,"For we are slaves. Yet our God has not abandoned us in our slavery, but has caused the kings of Persia to extend grace to us, reviving us, so that we can rebuild the house of our God, repair its ruins, and have a wall of defense in Y’hudah and Yerushalayim."
'Ezra,9,10,"“But now, our God, what are we to say after this? For we have abandoned your mitzvot"
'Ezra,9,11,"which you gave us through your servants the prophets when they said, ‘The land which you are going to in order to take possession of it is a land defiled by the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands, because of their disgusting practices, which have filled it with their filth from one end to the other."
'Ezra,9,12,"Therefore, you are not to give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons; and you are not to promote their peace or prosperity ever. Only in this way will you grow strong, enjoy the good things of the land and leave it as a lasting inheritance to your children.’"
'Ezra,9,13,"Now, after all that has come upon us because of our evil deeds and our deep guilt — and even so, you, our God, have punished us less than our sins deserve and have given us a surviving remnant "
'Ezra,9,14,"are we to break your mitzvot again by making marriages with the peoples who have these disgusting practices? Won’t you become so angry with us that you would destroy us completely, so that there would be no surviving remnant and no one who escapes?"
'Ezra,9,15,"ADONAI, God of Isra’el! You are just; yet we have been left a surviving remnant that has escaped, as is the case today. Look, we are before you in our guilt; because of it, no one can stand in your presence.”"
'Ezra,10,1,"While ‘Ezra was praying and making confession, weeping and prostrated before the house of God, a huge crowd of Isra’el’s men, women and children gathered around him; and the people were weeping bitterly."
'Ezra,10,2,"Sh’khanyah the son of Yechi’el, one of the descendants of ‘Eilam, spoke up and said to ‘Ezra, “We have acted treacherously toward our God by marrying foreign women from the peoples of the land. But in spite of this, there is still hope for Isra’el."
'Ezra,10,3,"We should make a covenant with our God to send away all these wives, along with their children, in obedience to the advice of Adonai and of those who tremble at the mitzvah of our God; let us act in accordance with the Torah."
'Ezra,10,4,"Stand up, and do your duty, for we are with you; take courage, and do it!”"
'Ezra,10,5,"‘Ezra stood up, and he made the chief cohanim, the L’vi’im and all Isra’el swear that they would act according to what had been said; and they took the oath."
'Ezra,10,6,"‘Ezra then left his place in front of the house of God and went to the room of Y’hochanan the son of Elyashiv. After going there, he neither ate food nor drank water; because he was mourning over the treachery of the exiles."
'Ezra,10,7,A proclamation was issued throughout Y’hudah and Yerushalayim that all the exiles were to assemble in Yerushalayim
'Ezra,10,8,"and that whoever didn’t come within three days, in answer to the summons from the officials and leaders, would forfeit all he owned and himself be banished from the community of the exiles."
'Ezra,10,9,"All the men of Y’hudah and Binyamin assembled in Yerushalayim within the three days. It was the twentieth day of the ninth month. All the people sat in the open place in front of the house of God, trembling because of this matter and because of the heavy rain."
'Ezra,10,10,‘Ezra the cohen stood up and addressed them: “You have acted treacherously by marrying foreign women and have thus increased Isra’el’s guilt.
'Ezra,10,11,"Now, therefore, make confession to ADONAI, the God of your ancestors; and do what will please him by separating yourselves from the peoples of the land and from the foreign women.”"
'Ezra,10,12,"In response, the whole assembly cried aloud, “Yes, our duty is to do as you have said."
'Ezra,10,13,"But there are many people, and it’s the rainy season — we can’t stay out here in the open. Also, it isn’t the work of a day or two; for there are many of us who have committed this crime."
'Ezra,10,14,"Let our leaders represent the whole community; and let all those in our cities who have married foreign women appear at prearranged times, accompanied by the elders and judges of each city; until our God’s fierce anger over this has been turned away from us.”"
'Ezra,10,15,"Only Yonatan the son of ‘Asah’el and Yachz’yah the son of Tikvah, supported by Meshulam and Shabtai the Levi, opposed this."
'Ezra,10,16,"The exiles did as agreed. ‘Ezra the cohen chose heads of fathers’ clans by name, and they began their sessions to look into the matter on the first day of the tenth month."
'Ezra,10,17,They finished dealing with all the men who had married foreign women by the first day of the first month.
'Ezra,10,18,"Among the cohanim were found these who had married foreign women: of the sons of Yeshua the son of Yotzadak and his brothers: Ma‘aseiyah, Eli‘ezer, Yariv and G’dalyah."
