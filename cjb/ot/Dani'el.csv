Dani'el,1,1,"In the third year of the reign of Y’hoyakim king of Y’hudah, N’vukhadnetzar king of Bavel came to Yerushalayim and laid siege to it"
Dani'el,1,2,"and Adonai handed Y’hoyakim king of Y’hudah over to him, along with some of the articles from the house of God. He took them to the land of Shin‘ar, to the house of his god and placed the articles in the storehouse of his god."
Dani'el,1,3,"The king ordered Ashp’naz, the eunuch serving as his chief officer, to bring into the palace from the people of Isra’el some of royal or noble descent."
Dani'el,1,4,"They were to be boys without physical defect, handsome in appearance, versed in all kinds of wisdom, quick to learn, discerning, and having the capacity to serve in the king’s palace; and he was to teach them the language and literature of the Kasdim."
Dani'el,1,5,"The king assigned them a daily portion of his own food and the wine he drank, and they were to be cared for in this way for three years. At the end of this time they were to become the king’s attendants."
Dani'el,1,6,"Among these, from the people of Y’hudah, were Dani’el, Hananyah, Misha’el and ‘Azaryah."
Dani'el,1,7,"The chief officer gave them other names — to Dani’el he gave the name Belt’shatzar; to Hananyah, Shadrakh; to Misha’el, Meishakh; and to ‘Azaryah, ‘Aved-N’go."
Dani'el,1,8,"But Dani’el resolved that he would not defile himself with the king’s food or the wine he drank, so he asked the chief officer to be excused from defiling himself."
Dani'el,1,9,God caused the chief officer to be kind and sympathetic toward Dani’el
Dani'el,1,10,"however, the chief officer said to Dani’el, “I’m afraid of my lord the king. After all, he has given you an allowance of food and drink; so if he were to see you boys looking worse than the others your age, you would be putting my own head in danger from the king.”"
Dani'el,1,11,"Then Dani’el said to the guard whom the chief officer had put in charge of Dani’el, Hananyah, Misha’el and ‘Azaryah"
Dani'el,1,12,“Please! Try an experiment on your servants — for ten days have them give us only vegetables to eat and water to drink.
Dani'el,1,13,"Then see how we look, and compare us with how the boys who eat the king’s food look; and deal with your servants according to what you see.”"
Dani'el,1,14,He agreed to do what they had asked and gave them a ten-day test.
Dani'el,1,15,At the end of ten days they looked better and more robust than all the boys who were eating the king’s food.
Dani'el,1,16,"So the guard took away their food and the wine they were supposed to drink, and gave them vegetables."
Dani'el,1,17,"To these four boys God had given knowledge and skill in every aspect of learning and wisdom; moreover, Dani’el could understand all kinds of visions and dreams."
Dani'el,1,18,"When the time the king had set for them to be presented came, the chief officer presented them to N’vukhadnetzar"
Dani'el,1,19,"and when the king spoke with them, none was found among all of them to compare with Dani’el, Hananyah, Misha’el and ‘Azaryah. So they entered the king’s service"
Dani'el,1,20,"and in all matters requiring wisdom and understanding, whenever the king consulted them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and exorcists in his entire kingdom."
Dani'el,1,21,So Dani’el remained there until the first year of King Koresh.
Dani'el,2,1,"In the second year of the reign of N’vukhadnetzar, N’vukhadnetzar became so troubled by a series of dreams he had that he couldn’t sleep."
Dani'el,2,2,"So the king ordered the magicians, exorcists, sorcerers and astrologers summoned to interpret the king’s dreams to him. They came and stood in his presence."
Dani'el,2,3,"The king said to them, “I had a dream which will keep troubling my spirit until I know what it means.”"
Dani'el,2,4,"The astrologers spoke to the king in Aramaic: “May the king live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will interpret it.”"
Dani'el,2,5,"The king answered the astrologers, “Here is what I have decided: if you don’t tell me both the dream and its interpretation, you will be torn limb from limb and your houses reduced to rubble."
Dani'el,2,6,"But if you do state the dream and its interpretation, I will give you presents, rewards and great honor. Just tell me the dream and its interpretation.”"
Dani'el,2,7,"A second time they said, “Let his majesty tell his servants the dream, and we will interpret it.”"
Dani'el,2,8,"The king replied, “I see you’re only trying to gain time, because you see that I’ve decided"
Dani'el,2,9,"that if you don’t tell me the dream, there is only one sentence passed on all of you. So you’ve conspired to mislead me with lies in the hope that time will change things. Now, just tell me the dream! That will convince me that you will also be able to give me its correct interpretation.”"
Dani'el,2,10,"The astrologers answered the king, “Your majesty, nobody in the world can do this! Never has a king, no matter how great and powerful, asked such a thing of any magician or exorcist or astrologer."
Dani'el,2,11,"The king is asking a difficult thing; nobody but the gods could tell this to your majesty, and they don’t live with mere mortals.”"
Dani'el,2,12,At this the king flew into a rage and ordered all the sages of Bavel put to death.
Dani'el,2,13,"When the decree was published that the sages were to be slain, they sought Dani’el and his companions in order to have them put to death."
Dani'el,2,14,"Then, choosing his words carefully, Dani’el consulted Aryokh, captain of the royal guard, who had already gone out to kill the sages of Bavel."
Dani'el,2,15,"He said to Aryokh, “Since you are the king’s official, let me ask: why has the king issued such a harsh decree?” Aryokh explained the matter to Dani’el."
Dani'el,2,16,Then Dani’el went in and asked the king to give him time to tell the king the interpretation.
Dani'el,2,17,"Dani’el went home and made the matter known to Hananyah, Misha’el and ‘Azaryah, his companions"
Dani'el,2,18,"so that they could ask the God of heaven for mercy concerning this secret, and thus save Dani’el and his companions from dying along with the other sages of Bavel."
Dani'el,2,19,"Then the secret was revealed to Dani’el in a vision at night, and Dani’el blessed the God of heaven"
Dani'el,2,20,"in these words:
“Blessed be the name of God
from eternity past to eternity future!
For wisdom and power are his alone"
Dani'el,2,21,"he brings the changes of seasons and times;
he installs and deposes kings;
he gives wisdom to the wise
and knowledge to those with discernment."
Dani'el,2,22,"He reveals deep and secret things;
he knows what lies in the darkness;
and light dwells with him."
Dani'el,2,23,"I thank and praise you, God of my ancestors,
for giving me wisdom and power,
and revealing to me what we wanted from you,
for giving us the answer for the king.”"
Dani'el,2,24,"So Dani’el went to see Aryokh, whom the king had charged with destroying the sages of Bavel, and said to him, “Don’t destroy the sages of Bavel! Bring me before the king, and I will give the king the interpretation.”"
Dani'el,2,25,"Quickly Aryokh brought Dani’el before the king and told him, “I have found one of the exiles of Y’hudah who will reveal the interpretation to his majesty.”"
Dani'el,2,26,"The king said to Dani’el (who had been renamed Belt’shatzar), “Can you tell me what I dreamt and what it means?”"
Dani'el,2,27,"Dani’el answered the king, “No sage, exorcist, magician or astrologer can tell his majesty the secret he has asked about."
Dani'el,2,28,"But there is a God in heaven who unlocks mysteries, and he has revealed to King N’vukhadnetzar what will happen in the acharit-hayamim. Here are your dream and the visions you had in your head when you were in bed."
Dani'el,2,29,"“Your majesty, when you were in bed, you began thinking about what would take place in the future; and he who reveals secrets has revealed to you what will happen."
Dani'el,2,30,"Yet this secret has not been revealed to me because I am wiser than anyone living, but so that the meaning can be made known to your majesty, and then you can understand the thoughts of your own mind."
Dani'el,2,31,"“Your majesty had a vision of a statue, very large and extremely bright; it stood in front of you and its appearance was terrifying."
Dani'el,2,32,"The head of the statue was of fine gold, its chest and arms of silver, its trunk and thighs of bronze"
Dani'el,2,33,"its legs of iron, and its feet partly of iron and partly of clay."
Dani'el,2,34,"As you watched, a stone separated itself without any human hand, struck the statue on its feet made of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces."
Dani'el,2,35,"Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were all broken into pieces which became like the chaff on a threshing-floor in summer; the wind blew them away without leaving a trace. But the stone which had struck the statue grew into a huge mountain that filled the whole earth."
Dani'el,2,36,"“That is what you dreamt, and now we will give the king its interpretation."
Dani'el,2,37,"Your majesty, king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, the strength and the glory"
Dani'el,2,38,"so that wherever people, wild animals or birds in the air live, he has handed them over to you and enabled you to rule them all — you are the head of gold."
Dani'el,2,39,"But after you another kingdom will rise, inferior to you; then a third kingdom, of bronze, which will rule the whole world."
Dani'el,2,40,"The fourth kingdom will be as strong as iron. Iron can break anything into pieces, pulverize it and crush it. So just as iron can crush anything, this kingdom will break the other kingdoms into pieces and crush them."
Dani'el,2,41,"Finally, you saw the feet and toes made partly of pottery clay and partly of iron; this will be a divided kingdom; yet it will have some of the firmness of iron, since you saw the iron mixed with clay from the ground."
Dani'el,2,42,"Just as the toes of the feet were part iron and part clay, this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle."
Dani'el,2,43,You saw the iron mixed with clay; that means that they will cement their alliances by intermarriages; but they won’t stick together any more than iron blends with clay.
Dani'el,2,44,"“In the days of those kings the God of heaven will establish a kingdom that will never be destroyed, and that kingdom will not pass into the hands of another people. It will break to pieces and consume all those kingdoms; but it, itself, will stand forever "
Dani'el,2,45,"like the stone you saw, which, without human hands, separated itself from the mountain and broke to pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold. The great God has revealed to the king what will come about in the future. The dream is true, and its interpretation is reliable.”"
Dani'el,2,46,Then King N’vukhadnetzar fell on his face and worshipped Dani’el; he ordered that a grain offering and incense be offered to him.
Dani'el,2,47,"To Dani’el the king said, “Your God is indeed the God of gods, the Lord of kings and a revealer of secrets, since you have been able to reveal this secret.”"
Dani'el,2,48,"The king promoted Dani’el to a high rank, gave him many rich gifts and made him governor of the entire province of Bavel and head of all the sages of Bavel."
Dani'el,2,49,"At Dani’el’s request, the king put Shadrakh, Meishakh and ‘Aved-N’go in charge of the affairs of the province of Bavel, while Dani’el remained in attendance on the king."
Dani'el,3,1,"N’vukhadnetzar the king had a gold statue made, ninety feet high and nine feet wide, which he set up on the plain of Dura, in the province of Bavel."
Dani'el,3,2,"Then N’vukhadnetzar the king summoned the viceroys, prefects, governors, judges, treasurers, counselors, sheriffs and all the provincial officials to assemble and come to the dedication of the statue which N’vukhadnetzar the king had set up."
Dani'el,3,3,"The viceroys, prefects, governors, judges, treasurers, counselors, sheriffs and all the provincial officials assembled for the dedication of the statue which N’vukhadnetzar the king had set up. They stood in front of the statue that N’vukhadnetzar had set up"
Dani'el,3,4,"and a herald proclaimed, “Peoples! Nations! Languages! You are ordered"
Dani'el,3,5,"that when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, harp, zither, lute, bagpipe and the rest of the musical instruments, you fall down and worship the gold statue that N’vukhadnetzar the king has set up."
Dani'el,3,6,Whoever does not fall down and worship is to be thrown immediately into a blazing hot furnace.”
Dani'el,3,7,"Therefore, when all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, pipe, harp, zither, lute and the rest of the musical instruments, all the peoples, nations and languages fell down and worshipped the gold statue that N’vukhadnetzar the king had set up."
Dani'el,3,8,But then some Kasdim approached and began denouncing the Jews.
Dani'el,3,9,"They said to N’vukhadnetzar the king, “May the king live forever!"
Dani'el,3,10,"Your majesty, you have ordered that everyone who hears sound of the horn, pipe, harp, zither, lute, bagpipe and the rest of the musical instruments is to fall down and worship the gold statue"
Dani'el,3,11,and that whoever does not fall down and worship is to be thrown into a blazing hot furnace.
Dani'el,3,12,"There are some Jews whom you have put in charge of the affairs of the province of Bavel, Shadrakh, Meishakh and ‘Aved-N’go; and these men, your majesty, have paid no attention to you. They do not serve your gods, and they do not worship the gold statue you set up.”"
Dani'el,3,13,"In a raging fury N’vukhadnetzar ordered that Shadrakh, Meishakh and ‘Aved-N’go be brought. When the men had been brought before the king"
Dani'el,3,14,"N’vukhadnetzar said to them, “Shadrakh! Meishakh! ‘Aved-N’go! Is it true that you neither serve my gods nor worship the gold statue I set up?"
Dani'el,3,15,"All right, then. If you are prepared, when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, harp, zither, lute, bagpipe and the rest of the musical instruments, to fall down and worship the gold statue, very well. But if you won’t worship, you will immediately be thrown into a blazing hot furnace — and what god will save you from my power then?”"
Dani'el,3,16,"Shadrakh, Meishakh and ‘Aved-N’go answered the king, “Your question doesn’t require an answer from us."
Dani'el,3,17,"Your majesty, if our God, whom we serve, is able to save us, he will save us from the blazing hot furnace and from your power."
Dani'el,3,18,"But even if he doesn’t, we want you to know, your majesty, that we will neither serve your gods nor worship the gold statue which you have set up.”"
Dani'el,3,19,"N’vukhadnetzar became so utterly enraged that his face was distorted with anger against Shadrakh, Meishakh and ‘Aved-N’go. He ordered the furnace made seven times hotter than usual."
Dani'el,3,20,"Then he ordered some of the strongest men in his army to tie up Shadrakh, Meishakh and ‘Aved-N’go and throw them into the blazing hot furnace."
Dani'el,3,21,"So these men were tied up in their cloaks, tunics, robes and other clothes, and thrown into the blazing hot furnace."
Dani'el,3,22,"The king’s order was so urgent and the furnace so overheated that the men carrying Shadrakh, Meishakh and ‘Aved-N’go were burned to death by the flames."
Dani'el,3,23,"These three men, Shadrakh, Meishakh and ‘Aved-N’go, fell, bound, into the blazing hot furnace."
Dani'el,3,24,"Suddenly N’vukhadnetzar sprang to his feet. Alarmed, he asked his advisers, “Didn’t we throw three men, bound, into the flames?” They answered the king, “Yes, of course, your majesty.”"
Dani'el,3,25,"But he exclaimed, “Look! I see four men, not tied up, walking around there in the flames, unhurt; and the fourth looks like one of the gods!”"
Dani'el,3,26,"N’vukhadnetzar approached the opening of the blazing hot furnace and said, “Shadrakh! Meishakh! ‘Aved-N’go! You servants of El ‘Elyon! Come out, and come here!” Shadrakh, Meishakh and ‘Aved-N’go emerged from the flames."
Dani'el,3,27,"The viceroys, prefects, governors and royal advisers who were there saw that the fire had had no power on the bodies of these men — not even their hair was singed, their clothes looked the same, and they didn’t smell of fire."
Dani'el,3,28,"N’vukhadnetzar said, “Blessed be the God of Shadrakh, Meishakh and ‘Aved-N’go! He sent his angel to deliver his servants who trusted in him. They defied the royal order to the point of being willing to give up their bodies, in order not to serve or worship any god but their own God."
Dani'el,3,29,"Therefore I herewith decree that anyone, no matter from which people, nation or language, who says anything to insult the God of Shadrakh, Meishakh and ‘Aved-N’go is to be torn limb from limb, and his house is to be reduced to rubble; because there is no other god who can save like this.”"
Dani'el,3,30,"Then the king gave Shadrakh, Meishakh and ‘Aved-N’go higher rank in the province of Bavel."
Dani'el,3,31,"[The following letter was sent out:]
“From: N’vukhadnetzar the king
“To: All the peoples, nations and languages living throughout the earth:
“Shalom rav! [Abundant peace!]"
Dani'el,3,32,“I am pleased to recount the signs and wonders which the Most High God has done for me.
Dani'el,3,33,"“How great are his signs!
How powerful his wonders!
His kingdom lasts forever,
and he rules all generations."
Dani'el,4,1,"“I, N’vukhadnetzar, was contentedly living at home, enjoying the luxury of my palace"
Dani'el,4,2,"but as I lay on my bed, I had a dream which frightened me, followed by fantasies and visions in my head which frightened me even more."
Dani'el,4,3,"So I ordered all the sages of Bavel to present themselves to me, so that they could tell me the interpretation of the dream."
Dani'el,4,4,"When the magicians, exorcists, astrologers and diviners came, I told them the dream; but they couldn’t interpret it for me."
Dani'el,4,5,"Finally, however, Dani’el (renamed Belt’shatzar, after the name of my god), in whom is the spirit of the holy gods, came before me; and I told him the dream"
Dani'el,4,6,"‘Belt’shatzar, chief of the magicians! Because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and no mystery is too difficult for you, tell me the meaning of the visions I saw in my dream."
Dani'el,4,7,"Here are the visions I had in my head as I lay on my bed: I looked, and there before me was a tree at the center of the earth; it was very tall."
Dani'el,4,8,"The tree grew and became strong until its crown reached the sky, and it could be seen from anywhere on earth."
Dani'el,4,9,"Its foliage was beautiful and its fruit abundant; it produced enough food for everyone. The wild animals enjoyed its shade, the birds in the air lived in its branches, and it gave food to every living creature."
Dani'el,4,10,"I looked in the visions of my head as I lay on my bed, and there appeared a holy watcher coming down from heaven."
Dani'el,4,11,"He cried out:
“‘“Cut down the tree, cut off its branches,
strip off its leaves, scatter its fruit!
Let the wild animals flee from its shelter!
Let the birds abandon its branches!"
Dani'el,4,12,"But leave the stump with its roots in the ground,
with a band of iron and bronze,
in the lush grass of the countryside;
let him be drenched with dew from the sky
and share the lot of animals in the pasture"
Dani'el,4,13,"let his heart and mind cease to be human
and become those of an animal;
and let seven seasons pass over him."
Dani'el,4,14,"“‘“This order is issued by the watchers,
the sentence is announced by the holy ones,
so that all who live may know
that the Most High rules the human kingdom,
that he gives it to whomever he wishes
and can raise up over it the lowliest of mortals.”"
Dani'el,4,15,"“‘This is the dream which I, King N’vukhadnetzar, saw. Now you, Belt’shatzar, tell me its interpretation. None of the sages of my kingdom can tell me the interpretation, but you can do it, because the spirit of the holy gods is in you.’"
Dani'el,4,16,"“Dani’el, whose name was Belt’shatzar, was in shock awhile, frightened by his thoughts. The king said, ‘Belt’shatzar, don’t let the dream or the interpretation frighten you.’ Belt’shatzar answered, ‘My lord, if only the dream were about those who hate you, and the interpretation about your enemies!"
Dani'el,4,17,"The tree you saw which grew and became strong until its crown reached the sky, and it could be seen throughout the whole earth"
Dani'el,4,18,"that had beautiful foliage and abundant fruit, enough to feed everyone, under which the wild animals lived, and on whose branches the birds in the air built their nests "
Dani'el,4,19,"it’s you, your majesty! You have grown and become strong — your greatness has grown and reaches to heaven, and your rule extends to the end of the earth."
Dani'el,4,20,"“‘Now the king saw a holy watcher coming down from heaven, who said,
“‘“Cut down the tree, and destroy it,
but leave the stump with its roots in the ground,
with a band of iron and bronze,
in the lush grass of the countryside;
let him be drenched with dew from the sky
and share the lot of the wild animals
until seven seasons pass over him.”"
Dani'el,4,21,"“‘This is the interpretation, your majesty; and it is the decree of the Most High that has come upon my lord the king"
Dani'el,4,22,"“‘You will be driven from human society
to live with the wild animals.
You will be made to eat grass like an ox
and be drenched with dew from the sky,
as seven seasons pass over you;
until you learn that the Most High
rules in the human kingdom
and gives it to whomever he pleases."
Dani'el,4,23,"“‘But since it was ordered to leave the stump of the tree with its roots, your kingdom will be kept for you until you have learned that Heaven rules everything."
Dani'el,4,24,"Therefore, your majesty, please take my advice: break with your sins by replacing them with acts of charity, and break with your crimes by showing mercy to the poor; this may extend the time of your prosperity.’"
Dani'el,4,25,“All this happened to King N’vukhadnetzar.
Dani'el,4,26,"Twelve months later, as he was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Bavel"
Dani'el,4,27,"the king said, ‘Bavel the great! I built it as a royal residence by my power and force to enhance the glory of my majesty!’"
Dani'el,4,28,"No sooner had the king spoken these words when a voice came down from heaven: ‘King N’vukhadnetzar! These words are for you:
‘“The kingdom has left you."
Dani'el,4,29,"You will be driven from human society
to live with the wild animals.
You will be made to eat grass like an ox
and be drenched with dew from the sky,
as seven seasons pass over you,
until you learn that the Most High
rules in the human kingdom
and gives it to whomever he pleases.’"
Dani'el,4,30,"“Within the hour the word was fulfilled. N’vukhadnetzar was driven from human society, he ate grass like an ox, and his body was drenched with dew from the sky, until his hair had grown like eagles’ feathers and his nails like birds’ claws."
Dani'el,4,31,"“When this period was over, I, N’vukhadnetzar, lifted my eyes toward heaven, and my understanding came back to me. I blessed the Most High, I praised and gave honor to him who lives forever.
“‘For his rulership is everlasting,
his kingdom endures through all generations."
Dani'el,4,32,"All who live on earth are counted as nothing.
He does what he wishes with the army of heaven
and with those living on earth.
No one can hold back his hand
or ask him, “What are you doing?”’"
Dani'el,4,33,"“It was at that moment that my understanding came back to me; and for the sake of the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and splendor also came back to me. My advisers and lords sought me out, I was re-established in my kingdom, and to my previous greatness even more was added."
Dani'el,4,34,"So now I, N’vukhadnetzar, praise, exalt and honor the King of heaven:
“‘For all his works are truth,
and his ways are just;
and he can humble those who walk in pride.’”"
Dani'el,5,1,"Belshatzar the king gave a great banquet for a thousand of his lords, and in the presence of the thousand he was drinking wine."
Dani'el,5,2,"While tasting the wine, Belshatzar ordered that the gold and silver vessels which his father N’vukhadnetzar had removed from the temple in Yerushalayim be brought; so that the king, his lords, his wives and his concubines could drink from them."
Dani'el,5,3,"So they brought the gold vessels which had been removed from the sanctuary of the house of God in Yerushalayim; and the king, his lords, his wives and his concubines drank from them."
Dani'el,5,4,"They drank their wine and praised their gods made of gold, silver, bronze, iron, wood and stone."
Dani'el,5,5,"Suddenly, the fingers of a human hand appeared and began writing on the plaster of the palace wall by the lampstand. When the king saw the palm of the hand that was writing"
Dani'el,5,6,"the king’s face took on a different look. As frightening thoughts rose up within him, his hip joints gave way and his knees started knocking together."
Dani'el,5,7,"The king cried out to bring in the exorcists, astrologers and diviners. The king said to the sages of Bavel, “Whoever can read this inscription and tell me what it means will be dressed in royal purple, wear a gold chain around his neck and be one of the three men ruling the kingdom.”"
Dani'el,5,8,"But although all the king’s sages came in, none could read the inscription or tell the king what it meant."
Dani'el,5,9,"Then King Belshatzar became terrified; his face turned pale, and his lords were thrown into confusion."
Dani'el,5,10,"At this point the queen mother, because of what the king and his lords were saying, entered the banquet hall. The queen mother said, “May the king live forever! Don’t be scared by your thoughts or let your face be so pale."
Dani'el,5,11,"There is a man in your kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy gods. In the days of your father, he was found to have light, discernment and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods. King N’vukhadnetzar your father — the king, your father — made him chief of the magicians, exorcists, astrologers and diviners"
Dani'el,5,12,"because he was found to have an extraordinary spirit, knowledge, discernment, and the ability to interpret dreams, unlock mysteries and solve knotty problems. He is called Dani’el, but the king gave him the name Belt’shatzar. Now have Dani’el summoned, and he will tell you what this means.”"
Dani'el,5,13,"Dani’el was brought into the king’s presence. The king said to Dani’el, “Are you Dani’el, one of the exiles from Y’hudah whom the king my father brought out of Y’hudah?"
Dani'el,5,14,"I’ve heard about you that the spirit of the gods is in you, and that you have been found to have light, discernment and extraordinary wisdom."
Dani'el,5,15,"Now the sages, the exorcists, were brought in to me so that they could read this inscription and tell me what it means, but they couldn’t interpret it for me."
Dani'el,5,16,"However, I’ve heard that you can give interpretations and solve knotty problems. Now if you can read the inscription and tell me what it means, you will be dressed in royal purple, wear a gold chain around your neck and be one of the three men ruling the kingdom.”"
Dani'el,5,17,"Dani’el answered the king, “Keep your gifts, and give your rewards to someone else. However, I will read the inscription to the king and tell him what it means."
Dani'el,5,18,"Your majesty, the Most High God gave N’vukhadnetzar your father the kingdom, as well as greatness, glory and majesty."
Dani'el,5,19,"Because of the greatness he gave him, all the peoples, nations and languages trembled with fear before him. Anyone he wanted to, he put to death; anyone he wanted to, he kept alive; anyone he wanted to, he advanced; and anyone he wanted to, he humbled."
Dani'el,5,20,"But when he grew proud and his spirit became hard, he began treating people arrogantly, so he was deposed from his royal throne, and his glory was taken away from him."
Dani'el,5,21,"He was driven from human society, his heart was made like that of an animal, he lived with the wild donkeys, he was fed with grass like an ox, and his body was drenched with dew from the sky; until he learned that the Most High God rules in the human kingdom and sets up over it whomever he pleases."
Dani'el,5,22,"But, Belshatzar, you, his son, have not humbled your heart, even though you knew all this."
Dani'el,5,23,"Instead, you have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven by having them bring you the vessels from his house; and you and your lords, your wives and your concubines drank wine from them; then you offered praise to your gods of silver, gold, bronze, iron, wood and stone, which can’t see, hear or know anything. Meanwhile, God, who holds your very breath in his hands, and to whom belongs everything you do, you have not glorified."
Dani'el,5,24,This is why he sent the hand to write this inscription
Dani'el,5,25,"and the inscription says, ‘M’ne! M’ne! T’kel ufarsin.’"
Dani'el,5,26,This is what it means: ‘M’ne!’ — God has counted up your kingdom and brought it to an end.
Dani'el,5,27,‘T’kel’ — you are weighed on the balance-scale and come up short.
Dani'el,5,28,‘P’res’ — your kingdom has been divided and given to the Medes and Persians.”
Dani'el,5,29,"Then Belshatzar gave the order; and they clothed Dani’el in royal purple, put a gold chain around his neck and proclaimed of him that he was to be one of the three men ruling the kingdom."
Dani'el,5,30,"That very night Belshatzar, the king of the Kasdim, was killed."
Dani'el,6,1,The kingdom passed to Daryavesh the Mede when he was about sixty-two years old.
Dani'el,6,2,Daryavesh decided to set over the kingdom 120 viceroys to rule throughout the entire kingdom
Dani'el,6,3,"with three chiefs over them, of whom Dani’el was one, so that these viceroys could be responsible to them and so that the king’s interests would be safeguarded."
Dani'el,6,4,"But because an extraordinary spirit was in this Dani’el, he so distinguished himself above the other chiefs and the viceroys that the king considered putting him in charge of the whole kingdom."
Dani'el,6,5,"The other chiefs and the viceroys tried to find a cause for complaint against Dani’el in regard to how he performed his governing duties, but they could find nothing to complain about, no fault; on the contrary, because he was so faithful, not a single instance of negligence or faulty administration could be found."
Dani'el,6,6,"Then these men said, “We’re not going to find any cause for complaint against this Dani’el unless we can find something against him in regard to the law of his god.”"
Dani'el,6,7,"So these chiefs and viceroys descended on the king and said to him, “King Daryavesh, live forever!"
Dani'el,6,8,"All the chiefs of the kingdom, along with the prefects, viceroys, advisers and governors, have met and agreed that the king should issue a decree putting in force the following law: ‘Whoever makes a request of any god or man during the next thirty days, except of you, your majesty, is to be thrown into the lion pit.’"
Dani'el,6,9,"Now, your majesty, issue this decree over your signature, so that it cannot be revoked, as required by the law of the Medes and Persians, which is itself irrevocable.”"
Dani'el,6,10,"So King Daryavesh signed the document, and the decree became law."
Dani'el,6,11,"On learning that the document had been signed, Dani’el went home. The windows of his upstairs room were open in the direction of Yerushalayim; and there he kneeled down three times a day and prayed, giving thanks before his God, just as he had been doing before."
Dani'el,6,12,Then these men descended on Dani’el and found him making requests and pleading before his God.
Dani'el,6,13,"So they went to remind the king of his royal decree: “Didn’t you sign a law prohibiting anyone from making requests of any god or man within thirty days, except yourself, your majesty, on pain of being thrown into the lion pit?” The king answered, “Yes, that is true, as required by the law of the Medes and Persians, which is itself irrevocable.”"
Dani'el,6,14,"They replied to the king, “That Dani’el, one of the exiles from Y’hudah, respects neither you, your majesty, nor the decree you signed; instead, he continues praying three times a day.”"
Dani'el,6,15,"When the king heard this report, he was very upset. He determined to save Dani’el and worked until sunset to find a way to rescue him."
Dani'el,6,16,"But these men descended on the king and said to him, “Remember, your majesty, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no decree or edict, once issued by the king, can be revoked.”"
Dani'el,6,17,"So the king gave the order, and they brought Dani’el and threw him into the lion pit. The king said to Dani’el, “Your God, whom you are always serving, will save you.”"
Dani'el,6,18,"A stone was brought to block the opening of the pit, and the king sealed it with his own signet and with the signet of his lords, so that nothing concerning Dani’el could be changed."
Dani'el,6,19,"Then the king returned to his palace. He spent the night fasting and refusing to be entertained, as sleep eluded him."
Dani'el,6,20,"Early in the morning, the king got up and hurried to the lion pit."
Dani'el,6,21,"On approaching the pit where Dani’el was, the king cried in a pained voice to Dani’el, “Dani’el, servant of the living God! Has your God, whom you are always serving, been able to save you from the lions?”"
Dani'el,6,22,"Then Dani’el answered the king, “May the king live forever!"
Dani'el,6,23,"My God sent his angel to shut the lions’ mouths, so they haven’t hurt me. This is because before him I was found innocent; and also I have done no harm to you, your majesty.”"
Dani'el,6,24,"The king was overjoyed and ordered Dani’el taken up from the pit. So Dani’el was taken up from the pit, and he was found to be completely unharmed, because he had trusted in his God."
Dani'el,6,25,"Then the king gave an order, and they brought those men who had accused Dani’el, and they threw them into the lion pit — them, their children and their wives — and before they even reached the bottom of the pit, the lions had them in their control and broke all their bones to pieces."
Dani'el,6,26,"King Daryavesh wrote all the peoples, nations and languages living anywhere on earth:
“Shalom rav! [Abundant peace!]"
Dani'el,6,27,"“I herewith issue a decree that everywhere in my kingdom, people are to tremble and be in awe of the God of Dani’el.
“For he is the living God;
he endures forever.
His kingdom will never be destroyed;
his rulership will last till the end."
Dani'el,6,28,"He saves, rescues, does signs and wonders
both in heaven and on earth.
He delivered Dani’el
from the power of the lions.”"
Dani'el,6,29,"So this Dani’el prospered during the reign of Daryavesh, and also during the reign of Koresh the Persian."
Dani'el,7,1,"In the first year of Belshatzar king of Bavel, Dani’el had a dream and visions in his head, as he was lying on his bed. He wrote the dream down, and this is his account"
Dani'el,7,2,“I had a vision at night; I saw there before me the four winds of the sky breaking out over the great sea
Dani'el,7,3,"and four huge animals came up out of the sea, each different from the others."
Dani'el,7,4,"The first was like a lion, but it had eagle’s wings. As I watched, its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted off the earth and made to stand on two feet like a man, and a human heart was given to it."
Dani'el,7,5,"Then there was another animal, a second one, like a bear. It raised itself up on one side, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. It was told, ‘Get up, and gorge yourself with flesh!’"
Dani'el,7,6,"After this, I looked; and there was another one, like a leopard with four bird’s wings on its sides. The animal also had four heads, and it was given power to rule."
Dani'el,7,7,"After this, I looked in the night visions; and there before me was a fourth animal, dreadful, horrible, extremely strong, and with great iron teeth. It devoured, crushed and stamped its feet on what was left. It was different from all the animals that had gone before it, and it had ten horns."
Dani'el,7,8,"“While I was considering the horns, another horn sprang up among them, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots. In this horn were eyes like human eyes and a mouth speaking arrogantly."
Dani'el,7,9,"“As I watched, thrones were set in place;
and the Ancient One took his seat.
His clothing was white as snow,
the hair on his head was like pure wool.
His throne was fiery flames,
with wheels of burning fire."
Dani'el,7,10,"A stream of fire flowed from his presence;
thousands and thousands ministered to him,
millions and millions stood before him.
Then the court was convened, and the books were opened."
Dani'el,7,11,"“I kept watching. Then, because of the arrogant words which the horn was speaking, I watched as the animal was killed; its body was destroyed; and it was given over to be burned up completely."
Dani'el,7,12,"As for the other animals, their rulership was taken away; but their lives were prolonged for a time and a season."
Dani'el,7,13,"“I kept watching the night visions,
when I saw, coming with the clouds of heaven,
someone like a son of man.
He approached the Ancient One
and was led into his presence."
Dani'el,7,14,"To him was given rulership,
glory and a kingdom,
so that all peoples, nations and languages
should serve him.
His rulership is an eternal rulership
that will not pass away;
and his kingdom is one
that will never be destroyed."
Dani'el,7,15,"“As for me, Dani’el, my spirit deep within me was troubled; the visions in my head frightened me."
Dani'el,7,16,I approached one of those standing by and asked him what all this really meant. He said that he would make me understand how to interpret these things.
Dani'el,7,17,‘These four huge animals are four kingdoms that will arise on earth.
Dani'el,7,18,"But the holy ones of the Most High will receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever, yes, forever and ever.’"
Dani'el,7,19,"“Then I wanted to know what the fourth beast meant, the one that was different from all the others, so very terrifying, with iron teeth and bronze nails, which devoured, crushed and stamped its feet on what was left"
Dani'el,7,20,"and what the ten horns on its head meant; and the other horn which sprang up and before which three fell, the horn that had eyes and a mouth speaking arrogantly and seemed greater than the others."
Dani'el,7,21,"I watched, and that horn made war with the holy ones and was winning"
Dani'el,7,22,"until the Ancient One came, judgment was given in favor of the holy ones of the Most High, and the time came for the holy ones to take over the kingdom."
Dani'el,7,23,"This is what he said: ‘The fourth animal will be a fourth kingdom on earth. It will be different from the other kingdoms; it will devour the whole earth, trample it down and crush it."
Dani'el,7,24,"As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings will arise; and yet another will arise after them. Now he will be different from the earlier ones, and he will put down three kings."
Dani'el,7,25,"He will speak words against the Most High and try to exhaust the holy ones of the Most High. He will attempt to alter the seasons and the law; and [the holy ones] will be handed over to him for a time, times and half a time."
Dani'el,7,26,"But when the court goes into session, he will be stripped of his rulership, which will be consumed and completely destroyed."
Dani'el,7,27,"Then the kingdom, the rulership and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be given to the holy people of the Most High. Their kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all rulers will serve and obey them.’”"
Dani'el,7,28,"This is the end of the account. As for me, Dani’el, my thoughts frightened me so much that I turned pale; but I kept the matter to myself."
Dani'el,8,1,"After that first vision, it was in the third year of the reign of King Belshatzar that another vision appeared to me, Dani’el."
Dani'el,8,2,"I looked into the vision; and as I looked, I found myself in Shushan the capital, in the province of ‘Eilam. I looked into the vision, and I was by the Ulai canal."
Dani'el,8,3,"I looked up; and as I watched, there in front of the stream stood a ram with two horns. The horns were long, but one was longer than the other, and the longer one came up later [than the other]."
Dani'el,8,4,"I saw the ram pushing to the west, north and south; and no animals could stand up against it; nor was there anyone that could rescue from its power. So it did as it pleased and became very strong."
Dani'el,8,5,"I was beginning to understand, when a male goat came from the west, passing over the whole earth without touching the ground. The goat had a prominent horn between its eyes."
Dani'el,8,6,"It approached the ram with the two horns, which I had seen standing in front of the river, and charged it with savage force."
Dani'el,8,7,"I watched as it advanced on the ram, filled with rage against it, and struck the ram, breaking its two horns. The ram was powerless to stand against it. It threw the ram to the ground and trampled it down, and there was no one that could rescue it from the goat’s power."
Dani'el,8,8,"The male goat then became extremely strong; but when it was strong, the big horn was broken; and in its place arose what appeared to be four horns in the directions of the four winds of heaven."
Dani'el,8,9,"Out of one of them came a little horn which grew extremely big in the directions of the south and east, and in the direction of the Glory."
Dani'el,8,10,It grew so great that it reached the army of heaven; it hurled some of the army and the stars to the ground and trampled on them.
Dani'el,8,11,"Yes, it even considered itself as great as the prince of the army; the regular burnt offering was taken away from him, and the place of his sanctuary was thrown down."
Dani'el,8,12,"Through sin, the army was put in its power, along with the regular burnt offering. It flung truth on the ground as it acted and prospered."
Dani'el,8,13,"Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to the speaker, “How long will the events of the vision last, this vision concerning the regular offering and the transgression which is so appalling, that allows the sanctuary and the army to be trampled underfoot?”"
Dani'el,8,14,"The first said to me, “Two thousand three hundred evenings and mornings, after which the sanctuary will be restored to its rightful state.”"
Dani'el,8,15,"After I, Dani’el, had seen the vision and was trying to understand it, suddenly there stood in front of me someone who appeared to be a man."
Dani'el,8,16,"I heard a human voice calling from between the banks of the Ulai, “Gavri’el, make this man understand the vision!”"
Dani'el,8,17,"He came up to where I was standing, and his approach so terrified me that I fell on my face. But he said to me, “Human being! Understand that the vision refers to the time of the end.”"
Dani'el,8,18,"As he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep, with my face toward the ground; but he touched me, set me on my feet"
Dani'el,8,19,"and said, “I am going to explain to you what will happen at the end of the period of fury, because [the vision] has to do with the time at the end."
Dani'el,8,20,You saw a ram with two horns which are the kings of Media and Persia.
Dani'el,8,21,"The shaggy male goat is the king of Greece, and the prominent horn between its eyes is the first king."
Dani'el,8,22,"As for the horn that broke and the four which rose up in its place, four kingdoms will arise out of this nation, but not with the power the first king had."
Dani'el,8,23,"In the latter part of their reign, when the evildoers have become as evil as possible, there will arise an arrogant king skilled in intrigue."
Dani'el,8,24,"His power will be great, but not with the power the first king had. He will be amazingly destructive, he will succeed in whatever he does, and he will destroy the mighty and the holy ones."
Dani'el,8,25,"He will succeed through craftiness and deceit, become swelled with pride, and destroy many people just when they feel the most secure. He will even challenge the prince of princes; but, without human intervention, he will be broken."
Dani'el,8,26,"The vision of the evenings and mornings which has been told is true; but you are to keep the vision secret, because it is about days in the distant future.”"
Dani'el,8,27,"I, Dani’el, grew weak and was ill for some days. Then I got up and took care of the king’s affairs; but I was appalled at the vision and still couldn’t understand it."
Dani'el,9,1,"In the first year of Daryavesh the son of Achashverosh, a Mede by birth who was made king over the kingdom of the Kasdim "
Dani'el,9,2,"in the first year of his reign, I, Dani’el, was reading the Scriptures and thinking about the number of years which ADONAI had told Yirmeyah the prophet would be the period of Yerushalayim’s desolation, seventy years."
Dani'el,9,3,"I turned to Adonai, God, to seek an answer, pleading with him in prayer, with fasting, sackcloth and ashes."
Dani'el,9,4,"I prayed to ADONAI my God and made this confession:
“Please, Adonai, great and fearsome God, who keeps his covenant and extends grace to those who love him and observe his mitzvot!"
Dani'el,9,5,"We have sinned, done wrong, acted wickedly, rebelled and turned away from your mitzvot and rulings."
Dani'el,9,6,"We have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our leaders, our ancestors and to all the people of the land."
Dani'el,9,7,"“To you, Adonai, belongs righteousness; but to us today belongs shame — to us, the men of Y’hudah, the inhabitants of Yerushalayim and all Isra’el, including those nearby and those far away, throughout all the countries where you have driven them; because they broke faith with you."
Dani'el,9,8,"Yes, ADONAI, shame falls on us, our kings, our leaders and our ancestors; because we sinned against you."
Dani'el,9,9,"It is for Adonai our God to show compassion and forgiveness, because we rebelled against him."
Dani'el,9,10,"We didn’t listen to the voice of ADONAI our God, so that we could live by his laws, which he presented to us through his servants the prophets."
Dani'el,9,11,"Yes, all Isra’el flouted your Torah and turned away, unwilling to listen to your voice. Therefore the curse and oath written in the Torah of Moshe the servant of God was poured out on us, because we sinned against him."
Dani'el,9,12,"He carried out the threats he spoke against us and against our judges who judged us, by bringing upon us disaster so great that under all of heaven, nothing has been done like what has been done to Yerushalayim."
Dani'el,9,13,"As written in the Torah of Moshe, this whole disaster came upon us. Yet we did not appease ADONAI our God by renouncing our wrongdoing and discerning your truth."
Dani'el,9,14,"So ADONAI watched for the right moment to bring this disaster upon us, for ADONAI our God was just in everything he did, yet we didn’t listen when he spoke."
Dani'el,9,15,"“Now, Adonai our God, who brought your people out of the land of Egypt with a strong hand, thereby winning renown for yourself, as is the case today — we sinned, we acted wickedly."
Dani'el,9,16,"Adonai, in keeping with all your justice, please allow your anger and fury to be turned away from your city Yerushalayim, your holy mountain; because it is due to our sins and the wrongdoings of our ancestors that Yerushalayim and your people have become objects of scorn among everyone around us."
Dani'el,9,17,"Therefore, our God, listen to the prayer and pleadings of your servant; and cause your face to shine on your desolated sanctuary, for your own sake."
Dani'el,9,18,"My God, turn your ear, and hear; open your eyes and see how desolated we are, as well as the city which bears your name. For we plead with you not because of our own righteousness, but because of your compassion."
Dani'el,9,19,"Adonai, hear! Adonai, forgive! Adonai, pay attention, and don’t delay action — for your own sake, my God, because your city and your people bear your name!”"
Dani'el,9,20,"While I was speaking, praying, confessing my own sin and the sin of my people Isra’el, and pleading before ADONAI my God for the holy mountain of my God "
Dani'el,9,21,"yes, while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gavri’el, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, swooped down on me in full flight at about the time of the evening sacrifice"
Dani'el,9,22,"and explained things to me. He said, “I have come now, Dani’el, to enable you to understand this vision clearly."
Dani'el,9,23,"At the beginning of your prayers, an answer was given; and I have come to say what it is; because you are greatly loved. Therefore look into this answer, and understand the vision."
Dani'el,9,24,"“Seventy weeks have been decreed for your people and for your holy city for putting an end to the transgression, for making an end of sin, for forgiving iniquity, for bringing in everlasting justice, for setting the seal on vision and prophet, and for anointing the Especially Holy Place."
Dani'el,9,25,"Know, therefore, and discern that seven weeks [of years] will elapse between the issuing of the decree to restore and rebuild Yerushalayim until an anointed prince comes. It will remain built for sixty-two weeks [of years], with open spaces and moats; but these will be troubled times."
Dani'el,9,26,"Then, after the sixty-two weeks, Mashiach will be cut off and have nothing. The people of a prince yet to come will destroy the city and the sanctuary, but his end will come with a flood, and desolations are decreed until the war is over."
Dani'el,9,27,He will make a strong covenant with leaders for one week [of years]. For half of the week he will put a stop to the sacrifice and the grain offering. On the wing of detestable things the desolator will come and continue until the already decreed destruction is poured out on the desolator.”
Dani'el,10,1,"In the third year of Koresh king of Persia, a word was revealed to Dani’el, also called Belt’shatzar. The word was certain: a great war. He understood the word, having gained understanding in the vision."
Dani'el,10,2,"At that time I, Dani’el, had been mourning for three whole weeks."
Dani'el,10,3,"I hadn’t eaten any food that satisfied me — neither meat nor wine had entered my mouth, and I didn’t anoint myself once, until three full weeks had passed."
Dani'el,10,4,"On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, I was on the bank of the great river, the Tigris"
Dani'el,10,5,"when I looked up, and there before me was a man dressed in linen wearing a belt made of fine Ufaz gold."
Dani'el,10,6,"His body was like beryl, his face looked like lightning and his eyes like fiery torches; his arms and feet were the color of burnished bronze; and when he spoke, it sounded like the roar of a crowd."
Dani'el,10,7,"Only I, Dani’el, saw the vision; the men who were with me did not see the vision; however, a great trembling fell over them; so that they rushed to hide themselves."
Dani'el,10,8,"Thus I was left alone; and when I saw this great vision, there was no strength left in me — my face, normally pleasant-looking, became disfigured; and I had no strength."
Dani'el,10,9,"I heard his voice speaking; and when I heard him speaking, I fell down in a faint, with my face to the ground."
Dani'el,10,10,"Then a hand touched me and raised me, tottering, to my hands and knees."
Dani'el,10,11,"He said to me, “Dani’el, you are a greatly loved man. Now pay attention to the words I am saying to you, and stand upright; for it is to you that I have been sent now.” After he had said this to me, I stood up, trembling."
Dani'el,10,12,"Then he said to me, “Don’t be afraid, Dani’el; because since the first day that you determined to understand and to humble yourself before your God, your words have been heard; and I have come because of what you said."
Dani'el,10,13,"The prince of the kingdom of Persia prevented me from coming for twenty-one days; but Mikha’el, one of the chief princes, came to assist me; so that I was no longer needed there with the kings of Persia."
Dani'el,10,14,So I have come to make you understand what will happen to your people in the acharit-hayamim; for there is still another vision which will relate to those days.”
Dani'el,10,15,"After he had said these things to me, I looked down at the ground and couldn’t speak."
Dani'el,10,16,"Then someone who looked like a human being touched my lips, after which I could open my mouth and speak; I said to the one standing in front of me, “My lord, it is because of the vision that I am seized with such anguish; I don’t have any strength."
Dani'el,10,17,"For how can this servant of my lord speak with my lord, when my strength and breath have failed me?”"
Dani'el,10,18,"Then, again someone who looked human touched me and revived me."
Dani'el,10,19,"He said, “You man so greatly loved, don’t be afraid. Shalom to you; and be strong, yes, truly strong.” His speaking to me strengthened me, and I said, “My lord, keep speaking; because you’ve given me strength.”"
Dani'el,10,20,"Then he said, “Do you know why I came to you? Although now I must return to fight the prince of Persia; and when I leave, the prince of Greece will come"
Dani'el,10,21,"nevertheless, I will tell you what is written in the Book of Truth. There is no one standing with me against them except Mikha’el your prince"
Dani'el,11,1,"however, I was already standing up to support and help Daryavesh the Mede in the first year of his reign."
Dani'el,11,2,"What I am going to tell you now is true.
“Three kings will arise in Persia, followed by a fourth, who will be far wealthier than all of them; and when he has grown strong by means of his wealth, he will stir up everyone against the kingdom of Greece."
Dani'el,11,3,“Then a powerful king will appear who will rule a vast kingdom and do whatever he pleases.
Dani'el,11,4,"But once he appears, his kingdom will be broken up and divided to the four winds of heaven. It won’t be inherited by his descendants, and it won’t be ruled with the power he had, because his kingship will be uprooted and will pass to others than his own posterity."
Dani'el,11,5,"“The king in the south will be strong, and one of his princes will gain power over him and have dominion; his domain will be a great dominion."
Dani'el,11,6,"After a number of years they will form an alliance. The daughter of the king of the south will approach the king of the north to make an agreement, but she won’t retain her power; and he and his power won’t last either. Rather, she will be surrendered, along with her attendants, her father and the one who supported her during those times."
Dani'el,11,7,"But another branch from the same roots as hers will appear in her father’s place. He will attack the army of the king of the north, enter his fortress and succeed in conquering them."
Dani'el,11,8,"He will also carry off as booty to Egypt their gods, their cast metal images and their valuable gold and silver vessels. Then for some years, he will refrain from attacking the king of the north."
Dani'el,11,9,"“Afterwards, the king of the north will invade the kingdom of the king of the south, but he will retire to his own land."
Dani'el,11,10,"His sons will rouse themselves to muster a large and powerful army, which will advance like a flood passing through. In another campaign, it will march on the enemy stronghold."
Dani'el,11,11,"The king of the south, enraged, will set out to do battle with the king of the north, who, in turn, will muster a large army; but this army will be defeated by his enemy"
Dani'el,11,12,"and carried off. The conqueror will grow proud as he slaughters tens of thousands, yet he will not prevail."
Dani'el,11,13,"Rather, the king of the north will again muster an army, larger than the first one, at the end of this period, after a number of years; it will be a large, well-supplied army."
Dani'el,11,14,Those will be times in which many will resist the king of the south; and the more violent ones among your own people will rebel in order to fulfill their vision; but they will fail.
Dani'el,11,15,"“Then the king of the north will come, set up siege-works and capture a fortified city; the forces of the south will be insufficient defense, even his elite troops will not be strong enough to resist."
Dani'el,11,16,"The invader will do as he pleases; no one will be able to withstand him. So he will establish himself in the Land of Glory, and he will have the power to destroy it."
Dani'el,11,17,"He will determinedly advance with the full force of his kingdom, but he will make an agreement with the king of the south and give him a daughter in marriage. His object will be to destroy him, but the agreement will not last or work out in his favor."
Dani'el,11,18,"Next, he will put his attention on the coastlands and islands and capture many, but an army commander will put a stop to his outrages and cause his outrages to come back upon him."
Dani'el,11,19,"After this, he will put his attention on the strongholds in his own land; but he will stumble, fall and not be seen again."
Dani'el,11,20,"“In his place will arise one who will send a tax collector through the Glorious Kingdom; but within a few days, he will be broken, though neither in anger nor in battle."
Dani'el,11,21,"“There will arise in his place a despicable man not entitled to inherit the majesty of the kingdom, but he will come without warning and gain the kingdom by intrigue."
Dani'el,11,22,"Large armies will be broken and swept away before him, as well as the prince of the covenant."
Dani'el,11,23,"Alliances will be made with him, but he will undermine them by deceit. Then, although he will have but a small following, he will emerge and become strong."
Dani'el,11,24,"Without warning, he will assail the most powerful men in each province and do things his predecessors never did, either recently or in the distant past; he will reward them with plunder, spoil and wealth while devising plots against their strongholds, but only for a time."
Dani'el,11,25,"“He will summon his power and courage against the king of the south with a great army, and the king of the south will fight back with a very large and powerful army; but he will not succeed, because of plots devised against him."
Dani'el,11,26,"Yes, those who shared his food will destroy him; his army will be swept away; and many will fall in the slaughter."
Dani'el,11,27,"These two kings, bent on mischief, will sit at the same table, speaking lies to each other; but none of this will succeed; because the appointed end will not have come yet."
Dani'el,11,28,"Then the king of the north will return to his own land with great wealth; with his heart set against the holy covenant, he will take action and then return home."
Dani'el,11,29,"“At the time designated, he will come back to the south. But this time, things will turn out differently than before"
Dani'el,11,30,"because ships from Kittim will come against him, so that his courage will fail him. Then, in retreat, he will take furious action against the holy covenant, again showing favor to those who abandon the holy covenant."
Dani'el,11,31,Armed forces will come at his order and profane the sanctuary and fortress. They will abolish the daily burnt offering and set up the abomination that causes desolation.
Dani'el,11,32,"Those who act wickedly against the covenant he will corrupt with his blandishments, but the people who know their God will stand firm and prevail."
Dani'el,11,33,"Those among the people who have discernment will cause the rest of the people to understand what is happening; nevertheless, for a while they will fall victim to sword, fire, exile and pillage."
Dani'el,11,34,"When they stumble, they will receive a little help, although many who join them will be insincere."
Dani'el,11,35,"Even some of those with discernment will stumble, so that some of them will be refined, purified and cleansed for an end yet to come at the designated time."
Dani'el,11,36,"“The king will do as he pleases. He will exalt himself and consider himself greater than any god, and he will utter monstrous blasphemies against the God of gods. He will prosper only until the period of wrath is over, for what has been determined must take place."
Dani'el,11,37,"He will show no respect for the gods his ancestors worshipped, or for the god women worship — he won’t show respect for any god, because he will consider himself greater than all of them."
Dani'el,11,38,"But instead, he will honor the god of strongholds; with gold, silver, precious stones and other costly things he will honor a god unknown to his ancestors."
Dani'el,11,39,"He will deal with the strongest fortresses with the help of a foreign god. He will confer honor on those he acknowledges, causing them to rule over many and distributing land as a reward."
Dani'el,11,40,"“When the time for the end comes, the king of the south will push at him; while the king of the north will attack him like a whirlwind, with chariots, cavalry and a large navy. He will invade countries, overrun them and move on."
Dani'el,11,41,"He will also enter the Land of Glory, and many [countries] will come to grief, but these will be saved from his power — Edom, Mo’av and the people of ‘Amon."
Dani'el,11,42,He will reach out his hand to seize other countries too. The land of Egypt will not escape 
Dani'el,11,43,"he will control the treasures of gold and silver, as well as everything else in Egypt of value. Put and Ethiopia will be subject to him."
Dani'el,11,44,"However, news from the east and north will frighten him, so that he moves out in great fury to ruin and completely do away with many."
Dani'el,11,45,"Finally, when he pitches the tents of his palace between the seas and the mountain of the holy Glory, he will come to his end, with no one to help him."
Dani'el,12,1,"“When that time comes, Mikha’el, the great prince who champions your people, will stand up; and there will be a time of distress unparalleled between the time they became a nation and that moment. At that time, your people will be delivered, everyone whose name is found written in the book."
Dani'el,12,2,"Many of those sleeping in the dust of the earth will awaken, some to everlasting life and some to everlasting shame and abhorrence."
Dani'el,12,3,"But those who can discern will shine like the brightness of heaven’s dome, and those who turn many to righteousness like the stars forever and ever."
Dani'el,12,4,"“But you, Dani’el, keep these words secret, and seal up the book until the time of the end. Many will rush here and there as knowledge increases.”"
Dani'el,12,5,"Then I, Dani’el, looked; and I saw in front of me two others, one on this bank of the river and the other on its other bank."
Dani'el,12,6,"One of them asked the man dressed in linen who was above the water of the river, “How long will these wonders last?”"
Dani'el,12,7,"The man dressed in linen who was above the water of the river raised his right and left hands toward heaven and swore by him who lives forever that it would be for a time, times and a half, and that it will be when the the power of the holy people is no longer being shattered that all these things will end."
Dani'el,12,8,"I heard this, but I couldn’t understand what it meant; so I asked, “Lord, what will be the outcome of all this?”"
Dani'el,12,9,"But he said, “Go your way, Dani’el; for these words are to remain secret and sealed until the time of the end."
Dani'el,12,10,"Many will purify, cleanse and refine themselves; but the wicked will keep on acting wickedly, and none of the wicked will understand. But those with discernment will understand."
Dani'el,12,11,"From the time the regular burnt offering is taken away and the abomination that causes desolation is set up, there will be 1,290 days."
Dani'el,12,12,"How blessed will be anyone who waits and arrives at the 1,335 days."
Dani'el,12,13,"But you, go your way until the end comes. Then you will rest and rise for your reward, at the end of days.”"
