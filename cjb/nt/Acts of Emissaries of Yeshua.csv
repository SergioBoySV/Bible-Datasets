Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,1,18,"(With the money Y’hudah received for his evil deed, he bought a field; and there he fell to his death. His body swelled up and burst open, and all his insides spilled out."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,1,19,"This became known to everyone in Yerushalayim, so they called that field Hakal-D’ma — which in their language means “Field of Blood”)."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,1,20,"“Now,” said Kefa, “it is written in the book of Psalms,
‘Let his estate become desolate,
let there be no one to live in it’;
and
‘Let someone else take his place as a supervisor.’"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,1,21,"Therefore, one of the men who have been with us continuously throughout the time the Lord Yeshua traveled around among us"

Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,2,12,"Amazed and confused, they all went on asking each other, “What can this mean?”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,2,13,"But others made fun of them and said, “They’ve just had too much wine!”"

Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,2,23,"This man was arrested in accordance with God’s predetermined plan and foreknowledge; and, through the agency of persons not bound by the Torah, you nailed him up on a stake and killed him!"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,2,24,“But God has raised him up and freed him from the suffering of death; it was impossible that death could keep its hold on him.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,2,25,"For David says this about him:
‘I saw ADONAI always before me,
for he is at my right hand,
so that I will not be shaken."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,2,26,"For this reason, my heart was glad;

or let your Holy One see decay."

Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,2,29,"“Brothers, I know I can say to you frankly that the patriarch David died and was buried — his tomb is with us to this day."

“Sit at my right hand
until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.”’"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,2,36,"Therefore, let the whole house of Isra’el know beyond doubt that God has made him both Lord and Messiah — this Yeshua, whom you executed on a stake!”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,2,37,"On hearing this, they were stung in their hearts; and they said to Kefa and the other emissaries, “Brothers, what should we do?”"

Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,3,3,"When he saw Kefa and Yochanan about to enter, he asked them for some money."

Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,3,7,"And taking hold of him by his right hand, Kefa pulled him up. Instantly his feet and ankles became strong"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,3,8,"so that he sprang up, stood a moment, and began walking. Then he entered the Temple court with them, walking and leaping and praising God!"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,3,9,Everyone saw him walking and praising God.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,3,10,"They recognized him as the same man who had formerly sat begging at the Beautiful Gate of the Temple, and they were utterly amazed and confounded at what had happened to him."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,3,11,"While he clung to Kefa and Yochanan, all the people came running in astonishment toward them in Shlomo’s Colonnade."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,3,12,"Seeing this, Kefa addressed the people: “Men of Isra’el! Why are you amazed at this? Or why do you stare at us as if we had made this man walk through some power or godliness of our own?"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,3,13,"The God of Avraham, Yitz’chak and Ya‘akov, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Yeshua — the same Yeshua you handed over and disowned before Pilate, even after he had decided to release him."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,3,14,"You denied the holy and innocent one, and instead asked for the reprieve of a murderer!"

Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,3,17,"“Now, brothers, I know that you did not understand the significance of what you were doing; neither did your leaders."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,3,18,"But this is how God fulfilled what he had announced in advance, when he spoke through all the prophets, namely, that his Messiah was to die."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,3,19,"“Therefore, repent and turn to God, so that your sins may be erased"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,3,20,"so that times of refreshing may come from the Lord’s presence; and he may send the Messiah appointed in advance for you, that is, Yeshua."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,3,21,"He has to remain in heaven until the time comes for restoring everything, as God said long ago, when he spoke through the holy prophets."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,3,22,"For Moshe himself said, ‘ADONAI will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brothers. You are to listen to everything he tells you."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,3,23,Everyone who fails to listen to that prophet will be removed from the people and destroyed.’

Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,4,5,"The next day, the people’s rulers, elders and Torah-teachers assembled in Yerushalayim"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,4,6,"along with ‘Anan the cohen hagadol, Kayafa, Yochanan, Alexander and the other men from the family of the cohen hagadol."

Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,4,14,"Moreover, since they could see the man who had been healed standing right there beside them, there was nothing they could say to discredit the healing."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,4,15,So they told them to step away from the Sanhedrin while they discussed the matter privately.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,4,16,"“What can we do with these men?” they asked each other. “Why, anyone in Yerushalayim can see that a remarkable miracle has come about through them — we can’t possibly deny that."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,4,17,"But to prevent it from spreading any further among the people, let’s warn them not to speak any more to anyone in this name.”"

Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,4,29,"“So now, Lord, take note of their threats; and enable your slaves to speak your message with boldness!"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,4,30,Stretch out your hand to heal and to do signs and miracles through the name of your holy servant Yeshua!”

Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,5,2,"and, with his wife’s knowledge, withheld some of the proceeds for himself; although he did bring the rest to the emissaries."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,5,3,"Then Kefa said, “Why has the Adversary so filled your heart that you lie to the Ruach HaKodesh and keep back some of the money you received for the land?"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,5,4,"Before you sold it, the property was yours; and after you sold it, the money was yours to use as you pleased. So what made you decide to do such a thing? You have lied not to human beings but to God!”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,5,5,"On hearing these words, Hananyah fell down dead; and everyone who heard about it was terrified."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,5,6,"The young men got up, wrapped his body in a shroud, carried him out and buried him."

Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,5,8,"Kefa challenged her: “Tell me, is it true that you sold the land for such-and-such a price?” “Yes,” she answered, “that is what we were paid for it.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,5,9,"But Kefa came back at her, “Then why did you people plot to test the Spirit of the Lord? Listen! The men who buried your husband are at the door. They will carry you out too!”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,5,10,"Instantly she collapsed at his feet and died. The young men entered, found her there dead, carried her out and buried her beside her husband."

Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,5,12,"Meanwhile, through the emissaries many signs and miracles continued to be done among the people. United in mind and purpose, the believers met in Shlomo’s Colonnade"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,5,13,"and no one else dared to join them. Nevertheless, the people continued to regard them highly"

Now the cohen hagadol and his associates came and called a meeting of the Sanhedrin (that is, of Isra’el’s whole assembly of elders) and sent to the jail to have them brought."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,5,22,But the officers who went did not find them in the prison. So they returned and reported
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,5,23,"“We found the jail securely locked and the guards standing at the doors; but when we opened it, we found no one inside!”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,5,24,"When the captain of the Temple police and the head cohanim heard these things, they were puzzled and wondered what would happen next."

Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,6,4,but we ourselves will give our full attention to praying and to serving the Word.”
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,6,5,"What they said was agreeable to the whole gathering. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Ruach HaKodesh, Philip, Prochoros, Nikanor, Timon, Parmenas and Nicholas, who was a proselyte from Antioch."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,6,6,"They presented these men to the emissaries, who prayed and laid their hands on them."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,6,7,"So the word of God continued to spread. The number of talmidim in Yerushalayim increased rapidly, and a large crowd of cohanim were becoming obedient to the faith."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,6,8,"Now Stephen, full of grace and power, performed great miracles and signs among the people."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,6,9,"But opposition arose from members of the Synagogue of the Freed Slaves (as it was called), composed of Cyrenians, Alexandrians and people from Cilicia and the province of Asia. They argued with Stephen"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,6,10,but they could not stand up against his wisdom or the Spirit by which he spoke.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,6,11,"So they secretly persuaded some men to allege, “We heard him speak blasphemously against Moshe and against God.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,6,12,"They stirred up the people, as well as the elders and the Torah-teachers; so they came and arrested him and led him before the Sanhedrin."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,6,13,"There they set up false witnesses who said, “This man never stops speaking against this holy place and against the Torah"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,6,14,for we have heard him say that Yeshua from Natzeret will destroy this place and will change the customs Moshe handed down to us.”
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,6,15,Everyone sitting in the Sanhedrin stared at Stephen and saw that his face looked like the face of an angel.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,1,"The cohen hagadol asked, “Are these accusations true?”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,2,"and Stephen said:
“Brothers and fathers, listen to me! The God of glory appeared to Avraham avinu in Mesopotamia before he lived in Haran"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,3,"and said to him, ‘Leave your land and your family, and go into the land that I will show you.’"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,4,"So he left the land of the Kasdim and lived in Haran. After his father died, God made him move to this land where you are living now."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,5,"He gave him no inheritance in it, not even space for one foot; yet he promised to give it to him as a possession and to his descendants after him, even though at the time he was childless."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,6,"What God said to him was, ‘Your descendants will be aliens in a foreign land, where they will be in slavery and oppressed for four hundred years."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,7,"But I will judge the nation that enslaves them,’ God said, ‘and afterwards they will leave and worship me in this place.’"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,8,"And he gave him b’rit-milah. So he became the father of Yitz’chak and did his b’rit-milah on the eighth day, and Yitz’chak became the father of Ya‘akov, and Ya‘akov became the father of the Twelve Patriarchs."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,9,“Now the Patriarchs grew jealous of Yosef and sold him into slavery in Egypt. But ADONAI was with him
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,10,"he rescued him from all his troubles and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who appointed him chief administrator over Egypt and over all his household."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,11,Now there came a famine that caused much suffering throughout Egypt and Kena‘an
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,12,"But when Ya‘akov heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our fathers there the first time."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,13,"The second time, Yosef revealed his identity to his brothers, and Yosef’s family became known to Pharaoh."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,14,"Yosef then sent for his father Ya‘akov and all his relatives, seventy-five people."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,15,"And Ya‘akov went down to Egypt; there he died, as did our other ancestors."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,16,Their bodies were removed to Sh’khem and buried in the tomb Avraham had bought from the family of Hamor in Sh’khem for a certain sum of money.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,17,"“As the time drew near for the fulfillment of the promise God had made to Avraham, the number of our people in Egypt increased greatly"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,18,until there arose another king over Egypt who had no knowledge of Yosef.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,19,"With cruel cunning this man forced our fathers to put their newborn babies outside their homes, so that they would not survive."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,20,"“It was then that Moshe was born, and he was beautiful in God’s sight. For three months he was reared in his father’s house"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,21,"and when he was put out of his home, Pharaoh’s daughter took him and brought him up as her own son."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,22,So Moshe was trained in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and became both a powerful speaker and a man of action.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,23,"“But when he was forty years old, the thought came to him to visit his brothers, the people of Isra’el."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,24,"On seeing one of them being mistreated, he went to his defense and took revenge by striking down the Egyptian."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,25,"He supposed his brothers would understand that God was using him to rescue them, but they didn’t understand."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,26,"When he appeared the next day, as they were fighting, and tried to make peace between them by saying, ‘Men, you are brothers! Why do you want to hurt each other?’"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,27,"the one who was mistreating his fellow pushed Moshe away and said, ‘Who made you a ruler and judge over us?"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,28,"Do you want to kill me, the way you killed that Egyptian yesterday?’"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,29,"On hearing this, Moshe fled the country and became an exile in the land of Midyan, where he had two sons."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,30,"“After forty more years, an angel appeared to him in the desert near Mount Sinai in the flames of a burning thorn bush."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,31,"When Moshe saw this, he was amazed at the sight; and as he approached to get a better look, there came the voice of ADONAI"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,32,"‘I am the God of your fathers, the God of Avraham, Yitz’chak and Ya‘akov.’ But Moshe trembled with fear and didn’t dare to look."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,33,"ADONAI said to him, ‘Take off your sandals, because the place where you are standing is holy ground."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,34,"I have clearly seen how My people are being oppressed in Egypt, I have heard their cry, and I have come down to rescue them, and now I will send you to Egypt.’"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,35,"“This Moshe, whom they rejected, saying, ‘Who made you a ruler and judge?’ is the very one whom God sent as both ruler and ransomer by means of the angel that appeared to him in the thorn bush."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,36,"This man led them out, performing miracles and signs in Egypt, at the Red Sea and in the wilderness for forty years."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,37,"This is the Moshe who said to the people of Isra’el, ‘God will raise up a prophet like me from among your brothers’"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,38,"This is the man who was in the assembly in the wilderness, accompanied by the angel that had spoken to him at Mount Sinai and by our fathers, the man who was given living words to pass on to us."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,39,"“But our fathers did not want to obey him. On the contrary, they rejected him and in their hearts turned to Egypt"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,40,"saying to Aharon, ‘Make us some gods to lead us; because this Moshe, who led us out of Egypt — we don’t know what has become of him.’"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,41,That was when they made an idol in the shape of a calf and offered a sacrifice to it and held a celebration in honor of what they had made with their own hands.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,42,"So God turned away from them and gave them over to worship the stars — as has been written in the book of the prophets,
‘People of Isra’el, it was not to me
that you offered slaughtered animals
and sacrifices for forty years in the wilderness!"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,43,"No, you carried the tent of Molekh
and the star of your god Reifan,
the idols you made so that you could worship them.
Therefore, I will send you into exile beyond Bavel.’"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,44,"“Our fathers had the Tent of Witness in the wilderness. It had been made just as God, who spoke to Moshe, had ordered it made, according to the pattern Moshe had seen."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,45,"Later on, our fathers who had received it brought it in with Y’hoshua when they took the Land away from the nations that God drove out before them.
“So it was until the days of David."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,46,He enjoyed God’s favor and asked if he might provide a dwelling place for the God of Ya‘akov
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,47,and Shlomo did build him a house.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,48,But Ha‘Elyon does not live in places made by hand! As the prophet says
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,49,"‘Heaven is my throne,’ says ADONAI,
‘and the earth is my footstool.
What kind of house could you build for me?
What kind of place could you devise for my rest?"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,50,Didn’t I myself make all these things?’
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,51,"“Stiffnecked people, with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You continually oppose the Ruach HaKodesh! You do the same things your fathers did!"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,52,"Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? They killed those who told in advance about the coming of the Tzaddik, and now you have become his betrayers and murderers! "
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,53,you! — who receive the Torah as having been delivered by angels — but do not keep it!”
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,54,"On hearing these things, they were cut to their hearts and ground their teeth at him."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,55,"But he, full of the Ruach HaKodesh, looked up to heaven and saw God’s Sh’khinah, with Yeshua standing at the right hand of God."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,56,"“Look!” he exclaimed, “I see heaven opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,57,"At this, they began yelling at the top of their voices, so that they wouldn’t have to hear him; and with one accord, they rushed at him"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,58,threw him outside the city and began stoning him. And the witnesses laid down their coats at the feet of a young man named Sha’ul.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,59,"As they were stoning him, Stephen called out to God, “Lord Yeshua! Receive my spirit!”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,7,60,"Then he kneeled down and shouted out, “Lord! Don’t hold this sin against them!” With that, he died"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,8,1,"and Sha’ul gave his approval to his murder.
Starting with that day, there arose intense persecution against the Messianic Community in Yerushalayim; all but the emissaries were scattered throughout the regions of Y’hudah and Shomron."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,8,2,Some godly men buried Stephen and mourned him deeply.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,8,3,"But Sha’ul set out to destroy the Messianic Community — entering house after house, he dragged off both men and women and handed them over to be put in prison."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,8,4,"However, those who were scattered announced the Good News of the Word wherever they went."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,8,5,Now Philip went down to a city in Shomron and was proclaiming the Messiah to them
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,8,6,"and the crowds were paying close attention to what Philip said, as they heard and saw the miraculous signs he was doing."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,8,7,"For many people were having unclean spirits driven out of them, shrieking; also many paralytics and crippled persons were being healed"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,8,8,so that there was great joy in that city.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,8,9,"But there was a man named Shim‘on in the city who for some time had been practicing magic and astonishing the nation of Shomron, claiming to be somebody great."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,8,10,"Everyone gave heed to him, from the lowest to the highest, saying, “This man is the power of God called ‘The Great Power’.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,8,11,They followed him because for a considerable time he had amazed them with his magic.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,8,12,"But when they came to believe Philip, as he announced the Good News concerning the Kingdom of God and the name of Yeshua the Messiah, they were immersed, both men and women."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,8,13,"Moreover, Shim‘on himself came to believe; and after being immersed, he attached himself closely to Philip; and he was amazed as he saw the miraculous signs and great works of power that kept taking place."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,8,14,"When the emissaries in Yerushalayim heard that Shomron had received the Word of God, they sent them Kefa and Yochanan"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,8,15,"who came down and prayed for them, that they might receive the Ruach HaKodesh."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,8,16,For until then he had not come upon any of them; they had only been immersed into the name of the Lord Yeshua.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,8,17,"Then, as Kefa and Yochanan placed their hands on them, they received the Ruach HaKodesh."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,8,18,"Shim‘on saw that the Spirit was given when the emissaries placed their hands on them, and he offered them money."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,8,19,"“Give this power to me, too,” he said, “so that whoever I place my hands on will receive the Ruach HaKodesh.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,8,20,"But Kefa said to him, “Your silver go to ruin — and you with it, for thinking the free gift of God can be bought!"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,8,21,"You have no part at all in this matter; because in the eyes of God, your heart is crooked."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,8,22,"So repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord. Perhaps you will yet be forgiven for holding such a thought in your heart."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,8,23,For I see that you are extremely bitter and completely under the control of sin!”
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,8,24,"Shim‘on answered, “Pray to the Lord for me, so that none of the things you have spoken about will happen to me.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,8,25,"Then, after giving a thorough witness and speaking the Word of the Lord, Kefa and Yochanan started back to Yerushalayim, announcing the Good News to many villages in Shomron."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,8,26,"An angel of ADONAI said to Philip, “Get up, and go southward on the road that goes down from Yerushalayim to ‘Azah, the desert road.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,8,27,"So he got up and went. On his way, he caught sight of an Ethiopian, a eunuch who was minister in charge of all the treasure of the Kandake, or queen, of Ethiopia. He had been to Yerushalayim to worship"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,8,28,"and now, as he was returning home, he was sitting in his chariot, reading the prophet Yesha‘yahu."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,8,29,"The Spirit said to Philip, “Go over to this chariot, and stay close to it.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,8,30,"As Philip ran up, he heard the Ethiopian reading from Yesha‘yahu the prophet. “Do you understand what you’re reading?” he asked."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,8,31,"“How can I,” he said, “unless someone explains it to me?” And he invited Philip to climb up and sit with him."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,8,32,"Now the portion of the Tanakh that he was reading was this:
“He was like a sheep led to be slaughtered;
like a lamb silent before the shearer, he does not open his mouth."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,8,33,"He was humiliated and denied justice.
Who will tell about his descendants,
since his life has been taken from the earth?”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,8,34,"The eunuch said to Philip, “Here’s my question to you — is the prophet talking about himself or someone else?”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,8,35,"Then Philip started to speak — beginning with that passage, he went on to tell him the Good News about Yeshua."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,8,36,"As they were going down the road, they came to some water; and the eunuch said, “Look! Here’s some water! Is there any reason why I shouldn’t be immersed?”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,8,37,
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,8,38,"He ordered the chariot to stop; then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and Philip immersed him."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,8,39,"When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away. The eunuch saw no more of him, because he continued on his way — full of joy."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,8,40,But Philip showed up at Ashdod and continued proclaiming the Good News as he went through all the towns until he came to Caesarea.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,1,"Meanwhile, Sha’ul, still breathing murderous threats against the Lord’s talmidim, went to the cohen hagadol"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,2,"and asked him for letters to the synagogues in Dammesek, authorizing him to arrest any people he might find, whether men or women, who belonged to “the Way,” and bring them back to Yerushalayim."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,3,"He was on the road and nearing Dammesek, when suddenly a light from heaven flashed all around him."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,4,"Falling to the ground, he heard a voice saying to him, “Sha’ul! Sha’ul! Why do you keep persecuting me?”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,5,"“Sir, who are you?” he asked. “I am Yeshua, and you are persecuting me."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,6,"But get up, and go into the city, and you will be told what you have to do.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,7,"The men traveling with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,8,"They helped Sha’ul get up off the ground; but when he opened his eyes, he could see nothing. So, leading him by the hand, they brought him into Dammesek."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,9,"For three days he remained unable to see, and he neither ate nor drank."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,10,"There was a talmid in Dammesek, Hananyah by name; and in a vision the Lord said to him, “Hananyah!” He said, “Here I am, Lord.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,11,"The Lord said to him, “Get up and go to Straight Street, to Y’hudah’s house; and ask for a man from Tarsus named Sha’ul; for he is praying"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,12,and in a vision he has seen a man named Hananyah coming in and placing his hands on him to restore his sight.”
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,13,"But Hananyah answered, “Lord, many have told me about this man, how much harm he has done to your people in Yerushalayim"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,14,and here he has a warrant from the head cohanim to arrest everyone who calls on your name.”
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,15,"But the Lord said to him, “Go, because this man is my chosen instrument to carry my name to the Goyim, even to their kings, and to the sons of Isra’el as well."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,16,For I myself will show him how much he will have to suffer on account of my name.”
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,17,"So Hananyah left and went into the house. Placing his hands on him, he said, “Brother Sha’ul, the Lord — Yeshua, the one who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here — has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Ruach HaKodesh.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,18,"In that moment, something like scales fell away from Sha’ul’s eyes; and he could see again. He got up and was immersed"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,19,"then he ate some food and regained his strength.
Sha’ul spent some days with the talmidim in Dammesek"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,20,and immediately he began proclaiming in the synagogues that Yeshua is the Son of God.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,21,"All who heard him were amazed. They asked, “Isn’t he the man who in Yerushalayim was trying to destroy the people who call on this name? In fact, isn’t that why he came here, to arrest them and bring them back to the head cohanim?”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,22,But Sha’ul was being filled with more and more power and was creating an uproar among the Jews living in Dammesek with his proofs that Yeshua is the Messiah.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,23,"Quite some time later, the non-believing Jews gathered together and made plans to kill him"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,24,but their plot became known to Sha’ul. They were watching the gates day and night in order to do away with him
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,25,"but under cover of night, his talmidim took him and let him down over the city wall, lowering him in a large basket."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,26,"On reaching Yerushalayim, he tried to join the talmidim; but they were all afraid of him — they didn’t believe he was a talmid."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,27,"However, Bar-Nabba got hold of him and took him to the emissaries. He told them how Sha’ul had seen the Lord while traveling, that the Lord had spoken to him, and how in Dammesek Sha’ul had spoken out boldly in the name of Yeshua."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,28,So he remained with them and went all over Yerushalayim continuing to speak out boldly in the name of the Lord.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,29,"He talked and debated with the Greek-speaking Jews, but they began making attempts to kill him."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,30,"When the brothers learned of it, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,31,"Then the Messianic community throughout Y’hudah, the Galil and Shomron enjoyed peace and was built up. They lived in the fear of the Lord, with the counsel of the Ruach HaKodesh; and their numbers kept multiplying."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,32,"As Kefa traveled around the countryside, he came down to the believers in Lud."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,33,"There he found a man named Aeneas who had lain bedridden for eight years, because he was paralyzed."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,34,"Kefa said to him, “Aeneas! Yeshua the Messiah is healing you! Get up, and make your bed!”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,35,"Everyone living in Lud and the Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.
Now in Yafo there was a talmidah named Tavita"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,36,(which means “gazelle”); she was always doing tzedakah and other good deeds.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,37,"It happened that just at that time, she took sick and died. After washing her, they laid her in a room upstairs."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,38,"Lud is near Yafo, and the talmidim had heard that Kefa was there, so they sent two men to him and urged him, “Please come to us without delay.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,39,"Kefa got up and went with them.
When he arrived, they led him into the upstairs room. All the widows stood by him, sobbing and showing all the dresses and coats Tavita had made them while she was still with them."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,40,"But Kefa put them all outside, kneeled down and prayed. Then, turning to the body, he said, “Tavita! Get up!” She opened her eyes; and on seeing Kefa, she sat up."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,41,"He offered her his hand and helped her to her feet; then, calling the believers and the widows, he presented her to them alive."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,42,"This became known all over Yafo, and many people put their trust in the Lord."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,9,43,"Kefa stayed on in Yafo for some time with a man named Shim‘on, a leather-tanner."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,1,"There was a man in Caesarea named Cornelius, a Roman army officer in what was called the Italian Regiment."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,2,"He was a devout man, a “God-fearer,” as was his whole household; he gave generously to help the Jewish poor and prayed regularly to God."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,3,"One afternoon around three o’clock he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God coming in and saying to him, “Cornelius!”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,4,"Cornelius stared at the angel, terrified. “What is it, sir?” he asked. “Your prayers,” replied the angel, “and your acts of charity have gone up into God’s presence, so that he has you on his mind."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,5,"Now send some men to Yafo to bring back a man named Shim‘on, also called Kefa."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,6,"He’s staying with Shim‘on the leather-tanner, who has a house by the sea.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,7,"As the angel that had spoken to him went away, Cornelius called two of his household slaves and one of his military aides, who was a godly man"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,8,he explained everything to them and sent them to Yafo.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,9,"The next day about noon, while they were still on their way and approaching the city, Kefa went up onto the roof of the house to pray."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,10,"He began to feel hungry and wanted something to eat; but while they were preparing the meal, he fell into a trance"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,11,"in which he saw heaven opened, and something that looked like a large sheet being lowered to the ground by its four corners."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,12,"In it were all kinds of four-footed animals, crawling creatures and wild birds."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,13,"Then a voice came to him, “Get up, Kefa, slaughter and eat!”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,14,"But Kefa said, “No, sir! Absolutely not! I have never eaten food that was unclean or treif.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,15,The voice spoke to him a second time: “Stop treating as unclean what God has made clean.”
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,16,"This happened three times, and then the sheet was immediately taken back up into heaven."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,17,"Kefa was still puzzling over the meaning of the vision he had seen, when the men Cornelius had sent, having inquired for Shim‘on’s house, stood at the gate"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,18,and called out to ask if the Shim‘on known as Kefa was staying there.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,19,"While Kefa’s mind was still on the vision, the Spirit said, “Three men are looking for you."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,20,"Get up, go downstairs, and have no misgivings about going with them, because I myself have sent them.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,21,"So Kefa went down and said to the men, “You were looking for me? Here I am. What brings you here?”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,22,"They answered, “Cornelius. He’s a Roman army officer, an upright man and a God-fearer, a man highly regarded by the whole Jewish nation; and he was told by a holy angel to have you come to his house and listen to what you have to say.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,23,"So Kefa invited them to be his guests.
The next day, he got up and went with them, accompanied by some of the brothers from Yafo"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,24,and he arrived at Caesarea the day after that. Cornelius was expecting them — he had already called together his relatives and close friends.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,25,"As Kefa entered the house, Cornelius met him and fell prostrate at his feet."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,26,"But Kefa pulled him to his feet and said, “Stand up! I myself am just a man.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,27,"As he talked with him, Kefa went inside and found many people gathered."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,28,"He said to them, “You are well aware that for a man who is a Jew to have close association with someone who belongs to another people, or to come and visit him, is something that just isn’t done. But God has shown me not to call any person common or unclean"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,29,"so when I was summoned, I came without raising any questions. Tell me, then, why did you send for me?”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,30,"Cornelius answered, “Three days ago around this time, I was at minchah prayers in my house, when suddenly a man in shining clothes stood in front of me"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,31,"and said, ‘God has heard your prayer and remembered your acts of charity."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,32,"Now send to Yafo and ask for Shim‘on, known as Kefa; he is staying in the house of Shim‘on, a leather-tanner, by the sea.’"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,33,"So I sent for you immediately, and you have been kind enough to come. Now all of us are here in the presence of God to hear everything the Lord has ordered you to say.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,34,Then Kefa addressed them: “I now understand that God does not play favorites
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,35,"but that whoever fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him, no matter what people he belongs to."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,36,"“Here is the message that he sent to the sons of Isra’el announcing shalom through Yeshua the Messiah, who is Lord of everything."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,37,"You know what has been going on throughout Y’hudah, starting from the Galil after the immersion that Yochanan proclaimed"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,38,"how God anointed Yeshua from Natzeret with the Ruach HaKodesh and with power; how Yeshua went about doing good and healing all the people oppressed by the Adversary, because God was with him."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,39,"“As for us, we are witnesses of everything he did, both in the Judean countryside and in Yerushalayim. They did away with him by hanging him on a stake"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,40,but God raised him up on the third day and let him be seen
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,41,"not by all the people, but by witnesses God had previously chosen, that is, by us, who ate and drank with him after he had risen again from the dead."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,42,“Then he commanded us to proclaim and attest to the Jewish people that this man has been appointed by God to judge the living and the dead.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,43,"All the prophets bear witness to him, that everyone who puts his trust in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,44,Kefa was still saying these things when the Ruach HaKodesh fell on all who were hearing the message.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,45,All the believers from the Circumcision faction who had accompanied Kefa were amazed that the gift of the Ruach HaKodesh was also being poured out
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,46,"on the Goyim, for they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God. Kefa’s response was"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,47,"“Is anyone prepared to prohibit these people from being immersed in water? After all, they have received the Ruach HaKodesh, just as we did.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,10,48,And he ordered that they be immersed in the name of Yeshua the Messiah. Then they asked Kefa to stay on with them for a few days.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,11,1,The emissaries and the brothers throughout Y’hudah heard that the Goyim had received the word of God
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,11,2,"but when Kefa went up to Yerushalayim, the members of the Circumcision faction criticized him"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,11,3,"saying, “You went into the homes of uncircumcised men and even ate with them!”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,11,4,"In reply, Kefa began explaining in detail what had actually happened"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,11,5,"“I was in the city of Yafo, praying; and in a trance I had a vision. I saw something like a large sheet being lowered by its four corners from heaven, and it came down to me."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,11,6,"I looked inside and saw four-footed animals, beasts of prey, crawling creatures and wild birds."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,11,7,"Then I heard a voice telling me, ‘Get up, Kefa, slaughter and eat!’"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,11,8,"I said, ‘No, sir! Absolutely not! Nothing unclean or treif has ever entered my mouth!’"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,11,9,But the voice spoke again from heaven: ‘Stop treating as unclean what God has made clean.’
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,11,10,"This happened three times, and then everything was pulled back up into heaven."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,11,11,"“At that very moment, three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea arrived at the house where I was staying"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,11,12,"and the Spirit told me to have no misgivings about going back with them. These six brothers also came with me, and we went into the man’s house."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,11,13,"He told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying, ‘Send to Yafo and bring back Shim‘on, known as Kefa."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,11,14,He has a message for you which will enable you and your whole household to be saved.’
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,11,15,"“But I had hardly begun speaking when the Ruach HaKodesh fell on them, just as on us at the beginning!"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,11,16,"And I remembered that the Lord had said, ‘Yochanan used to immerse people in water, but you will be immersed in the Ruach HaKodesh.’"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,11,17,"Therefore, if God gave them the same gift as he gave us after we had come to put our trust in the Lord Yeshua the Messiah, who was I to stand in God’s way?”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,11,18,"On hearing these things, they stopped objecting and began to praise God, saying, “This means that God has enabled the Goyim as well to do t’shuvah and have life!”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,11,19,"Now those who had been scattered because of the persecution which had arisen over Stephen went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus and Antioch; they spoke God’s word, but only to Jews."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,11,20,"However, some of these, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, when they arrived at Antioch, began speaking to the Greeks too, proclaiming the Good News of the Lord Yeshua."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,11,21,"The hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number of people trusted and turned to the Lord."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,11,22,"News of this reached the ears of the Messianic community in Yerushalayim, and they sent Bar-Nabba to Antioch."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,11,23,"On arriving and seeing for himself the grace of God at work, he was glad; and he encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with their whole hearts"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,11,24,"for he was a good man, full of the Ruach HaKodesh and trust."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,11,25,Then Bar-Nabba went off to Tarsus to look for Sha’ul
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,11,26,"and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. They met with the congregation there for a whole year and taught a sizeable crowd. Also it was in Antioch that the talmidim for the first time were called “Messianic.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,11,27,"During this time, some prophets came down from Yerushalayim to Antioch"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,11,28,and one of them named Agav stood up and through the Spirit predicted that there was going to be a severe famine throughout the Roman Empire. (It took place while Claudius was Emperor.)
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,11,29,"So the talmidim decided to provide relief to the brothers living in Y’hudah, each according to his means"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,11,30,"and they did it, sending their contribution to the elders in the care of Bar-Nabba and Sha’ul."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,12,1,It was around this time that King Herod began arresting and persecuting certain members of the Messianic community
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,12,2,"and he had Ya‘akov, Yochanan’s brother, put to death by the sword."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,12,3,"When Herod saw how much this pleased the Judeans, he went on to arrest Kefa as well. It was during the Days of Matzah"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,12,4,"so when Herod seized him, he threw him in prison, handing him over to be guarded by four squads of four soldiers each, with the intention of bringing him to public trial after Pesach."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,12,5,"So Kefa was being held under watch in prison, but intense prayer was being made to God on his behalf by the Messianic community."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,12,6,"The night before Herod was going to bring him to trial, Kefa was sleeping between two soldiers. He was bound with two chains; and guards were at the door, keeping watch over the prison."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,12,7,"Suddenly an angel of ADONAI stood there, and a light shone in the cell. He tapped Kefa’s side and woke him. “Hurry! Get up!” he said; and the chains fell off his hands."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,12,8,"The angel said to him, “Put on your clothes and sandals,” and he did. “Throw on your robe,” he said, “and follow me!”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,12,9,"Going out, Kefa followed him but did not realize that what was happening through the angel was real — he thought he was seeing a vision."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,12,10,"Having passed a first guard and a second, they arrived at the iron gate leading to the city. This opened to them by itself, and they made their exit. They went down the length of one street, and suddenly the angel left him."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,12,11,"Then Kefa came to himself and said, “Now I know for sure that the Lord sent his angel to rescue me from Herod’s power and from everything the Judean people were hoping for.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,12,12,"Realizing what had happened, he went to the house of Miryam the mother of Yochanan (surnamed Mark), where many people had gathered to pray."

Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,12,14,"She recognized Kefa’s voice and was so happy that she ran back in without opening the door, and announced that Kefa was standing outside."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,12,15,"“You’re out of your mind!” they said to her. But she insisted it was true. So they said, “It is his angel.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,12,16,"Meanwhile, Kefa kept knocking; and when they opened the door and saw him, they were amazed."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,12,17,"Motioning to them with his hand to be quiet, he told them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison and said, “Tell all this to Ya‘akov and the brothers.” Then he left and went elsewhere."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,12,18,"When daylight came, there was no small commotion among the soldiers over what had become of Kefa."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,12,19,"Herod had a thorough search made for him, but they failed to find him, so he cross-examined the guards and ordered them put to death. Then Herod went down from Y’hudah to Caesarea and spent some time there."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,12,20,"Now Herod was very angry with the people of Tzor and Tzidon, so they joined together and sought an audience with him. After securing the support of Blastus, the king’s chief personal servant, they asked for peace; because they depended on the king’s lands for their food supply."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,12,21,"A day was set, and Herod in his royal robes sat on the throne and made a speech to them."

They ended up in Paphos, where they found a Jewish sorcerer and pseudo-prophet named Bar-Yeshua."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,13,7,"He had attached himself to the governor, Sergius Paulus, who was an intelligent man. Now the governor had called for Bar-Nabba and Sha’ul and was anxious to hear the message about God"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,13,8,"but the sorcerer Elymas (for that is how his name is translated) opposed them, doing his best to turn the governor away from the faith."

Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,13,10,"“You son of Satan, full of fraud and evil! You enemy of everything good! Won’t you ever stop making crooked the straight paths of the Lord?"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,13,11,"So now, look! The hand of the Lord is upon you; and for a while you will be blind, unable to see the sun.” Immediately mist and darkness came over Elymas; and he groped about, trying to find someone to lead him by the hand."

Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,13,26,“Brothers! — sons of Avraham and those among you who are ‘God-fearers’! It is to us that the message of this deliverance has been sent!

Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,14,16,"In times past, he allowed all peoples to walk in their own ways"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,14,17,"yet he did not leave himself without evidence of his nature; because he does good things, giving you rain from heaven and crops in their seasons, filling you with food and your hearts with happiness!”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,14,18,Even saying this barely kept the crowds from sacrificing to them.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,14,19,"Then some unbelieving Jews came from Antioch and Iconium. They won over the crowds, stoned Sha’ul and dragged him outside the city, thinking he was dead."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,14,20,"But as the talmidim gathered around him, he got up and went back into the town. The next day, he left with Bar-Nabba for Derbe."

Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,15,1,"But some men came down from Y’hudah to Antioch and began teaching the brothers, “You can’t be saved unless you undergo b’rit-milah in the manner prescribed by Moshe.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,15,2,"This brought them into no small measure of discord and dispute with Sha’ul and Bar-Nabba. So the congregation assigned Sha’ul, Bar-Nabba and some of themselves to go and put this sh’eilah before the emissaries and the elders up in Yerushalayim."

Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,15,8,"And God, who knows the heart, bore them witness by giving the Ruach HaKodesh to them, just as he did to us"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,15,9,"that is, he made no distinction between us and them, but cleansed their heart by trust."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,15,10,So why are you putting God to the test now by placing a yoke on the neck of the talmidim which neither our fathers nor we have had the strength to bear?
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,15,11,"No, it is through the love and kindness of the Lord Yeshua that we trust and are delivered — and it’s the same with them.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,15,12,Then the whole assembly kept still as they listened to Bar-Nabba and Sha’ul tell what signs and miracles God had done through them among the Gentiles.

Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,17,4,"Some of the Jews were persuaded and threw in their lot with Sha’ul and Sila, as did a great many of the Greek men who were “God-fearers,” and not a few of the leading women."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,17,5,"But the unbelieving Jews grew jealous; so they got together some vicious men from the riffraff hanging around in the market square, collected a crowd and started a riot in the city. They attacked Jason’s house, hoping to bring Sha’ul and Sila out to the mob."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,17,6,"But when they didn’t find them, they dragged Jason and some other brothers before the city authorities and shouted, “These men who have turned the whole world upside down have come here too!"

Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,17,12,"Many of them came to trust, as did a number of prominent Greek women and not a few Greek men."

Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,17,17,"So he began holding discussions in the synagogue with the Jews and the “God-fearers,” and in the market square every day with the people who happened to be there."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,17,18,"Also a group of Epicurean and Stoic philosophers started meeting with him. Some asked, “What is this babbler trying to say?” Others, because he proclaimed the Good News about Yeshua and the resurrection, said, “He sounds like a propagandist for foreign gods.”"

Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,17,23,"For as I was walking around, looking at your shrines, I even found an altar which had been inscribed, ‘To An Unknown God.’ So, the one whom you are already worshipping in ignorance — this is the one I proclaim to you."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,17,24,"“The God who made the universe and everything in it, and who is Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in man-made temples"

Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,18,2,"where he met a Jewish man named Aquila, originally from Pontus but having recently come with his wife Priscilla from Italy, because Claudius had issued a decree expelling all the Jews from Rome. Sha’ul went to see them"

Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,18,12,"But when Gallio became the Roman governor of Achaia, the unbelieving Jews made a concerted attack on Sha’ul and took him to court"

Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,18,14,"Sha’ul was just about to open his mouth, when Gallio said to the Jews, “Listen, you Jews, if this were a case of inflicted injury or a serious crime, I could reasonably be expected to hear you out patiently."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,18,15,"But since it involves questions about words and names and your own law, then you must deal with it yourselves. I flatly refuse to judge such matters.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,18,16,And he had them ejected from the court.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,18,17,"They all grabbed Sosthenes, the president of the synagogue, and gave him a beating in full view of the bench; but Gallio showed no concern whatever."

Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,18,20,"When they asked him to stay with them longer, he declined"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,18,21,"however, in his farewell he said, “God willing, I will come back to you.” Then he set sail from Ephesus."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,18,22,"After landing at Caesarea, he went up to Yerushalayim and greeted the Messianic community. Then he came down to Antioch"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,18,23,"spent some time there, and afterwards set out and passed systematically through the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the talmidim."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,18,24,"Meanwhile, a Jewish man named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was an eloquent speaker with a thorough knowledge of the Tanakh."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,18,25,"This man had been informed about the Way of the Lord, and with great spiritual fervor he spoke and taught accurately the facts about Yeshua, but he knew only the immersion of Yochanan."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,18,26,"He began to speak out boldly in the synagogue; but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the Way of God in fuller detail."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,18,27,"When he made plans to cross over into Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote the talmidim there to welcome him. On arrival, he greatly helped those who through grace had come to trust"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,18,28,"for he powerfully and conclusively refuted the unbelieving Jews in public, demonstrating by the Tanakh that Yeshua is the Messiah."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,19,1,"While Apollos was in Corinth, Sha’ul completed his travels through the inland country and arrived at Ephesus, where he found a few talmidim."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,19,2,"He asked them, “Did you receive the Ruach HaKodesh when you came to trust?” “No,” they said to him, “we have never even heard that there is such a thing as the Ruach HaKodesh.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,19,3,"“In that case,” he said, “into what were you immersed?” “The immersion of Yochanan,” they answered."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,19,4,"Sha’ul said, “Yochanan practiced an immersion in connection with turning from sin to God; but he told the people to put their trust in the one who would come after him, that is, in Yeshua.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,19,5,"On hearing this, they were immersed into the name of the Lord Yeshua"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,19,6,"and when Sha’ul placed his hands on them, the Ruach HaKodesh came upon them; so that they began speaking in tongues and prophesying."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,19,7,"In all, there were about twelve of these men."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,19,8,"Sha’ul went into the synagogue; and for three months he spoke out boldly, engaging in dialogue and trying to persuade people about the Kingdom of God."

Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,19,10,"This went on for two years; so that everyone, both Jews and Greeks, living in the province of Asia heard the message about the Lord."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,19,11,God did extraordinary miracles through Sha’ul.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,19,12,"For instance, handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were brought to sick people; they would recover from their ailments; and the evil spirits would leave them."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,19,13,"Then some of the Jewish exorcists who traveled from place to place tried to make use of the name of the Lord Yeshua in connection with people who had evil spirits. They would say, “I exorcise you by the Yeshua that Sha’ul is proclaiming!”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,19,14,"One time, seven sons of a Jewish cohen gadol named Skeva were doing this"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,19,15,"and the evil spirit answered them. It said, “Yeshua I know. And Sha’ul I recognize. But you? Who are you?”"

Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,19,17,"When all this became known to the residents of Ephesus, fear fell on all of them, Jews and Greeks alike; and the name of the Lord Yeshua came to be held in high regard."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,19,18,Many of those who had earlier made professions of faith now came and admitted publicly their evil deeds
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,19,19,"and a considerable number of those who had engaged in occult practices threw their scrolls in a pile and burned them in public. When they calculated the value of the scrolls, it came to fifty thousand drachmas."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,19,20,Thus the message about the Lord continued in a powerful way to grow in influence.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,19,21,"Some time later, Sha’ul decided by the Spirit to pass through Macedonia and Achaia and then go to Yerushalayim. “After I have been there,” he said, “I must visit Rome.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,19,22,"So he dispatched two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia; but he himself remained in the province of Asia for awhile."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,19,23,It was at this time that a major furor arose concerning the Way.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,19,24,"There was a silversmith named Demetrius who manufactured from silver, objects connected with the worship of the goddess Artemis; and he provided no small amount of work for the craftsmen."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,19,25,"He called a meeting of them and of those engaged in similar trades, and said, “Men, you understand that this line of business provides us our living."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,19,26,"And you can see and hear for yourselves that not only here in Ephesus, but in practically the whole province of Asia, this Sha’ul has convinced and turned away a considerable crowd by saying that man-made gods aren’t gods at all."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,19,27,"Now the danger is not only that the reputation of our trade will suffer, but that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will come to be taken lightly. It could end up with the goddess herself, who is worshipped throughout the province of Asia and indeed throughout the whole world, being ignominiously brought down from her divine majesty!”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,19,28,"Hearing this, they were filled with rage and began bellowing, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,19,29,"Soon the whole city was in an uproar. As one man, the mob rushed into the theater, dragging along Gaius and Aristarchus, Sha’ul’s traveling companions from Macedonia."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,19,30,"Sha’ul himself wanted to appear before the crowd, but the talmidim wouldn’t let him."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,19,31,"Even some of the officials of the province, friends of his, sent a message begging him not to risk entering the theater."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,19,32,"Meanwhile, some were shouting one thing and others something else, because the assembly was in complete confusion, and the great majority didn’t even know why they were there."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,19,33,"Some of the crowd explained the situation to Alexander, whom the Jews had pushed to the front. So Alexander motioned for silence, hoping to make a defense speech to the people."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,19,34,"But as soon as they recognized that he was a Jew, they began bellowing in unison, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!” and they kept it up for about two hours."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,19,35,"At last, the city clerk was able to quiet the crowd. “Men of Ephesus!” he said, “Is there anyone who doesn’t know that the city of Ephesus is the guardian of the temple of the great Artemis, and of the sacred stone which fell from the sky?"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,19,36,"Since this is beyond dispute, you had better calm down and not do anything rash."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,19,37,For you have brought these men here who have neither robbed the temple nor insulted your goddess.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,19,38,"So if Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen have a complaint against anyone, the courts are open and the judges are there — let them bring charges and counter-charges."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,19,39,"But if there is something more you want, it will have to be settled in a lawful assembly."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,19,40,"For we are in danger of being accused of rioting on account of what has happened today. There is no justification for it; and if we are asked, we will be unable to give any reasonable explanation for this disorderly gathering.”"

Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,22,14,"He said, ‘The God of our fathers determined in advance that you should know his will, see the Tzaddik and hear his voice"

Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,22,22,"They had been listening to him up to this point; but now they shouted at the top of their lungs, “Rid the earth of such a man! He’s not fit to live!”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,22,23,"They were screaming, waving their clothes and throwing dust into the air"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,22,24,"so the commander ordered him brought into the barracks and directed that he be interrogated and whipped, in order to find out why they were yelling at him like this."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,22,25,"But as they were stretching him out with thongs to be flogged, Sha’ul said to the captain standing by, “Is it legal for you to whip a man who is a Roman citizen and hasn’t even had a trial?”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,22,26,"When the captain heard that, he went and reported it to the commander, “Do you realize what you’re doing? This man is a Roman citizen!”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,22,27,"The commander came and said to Sha’ul, “Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?” “Yes,” he said."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,22,28,"The commander replied, “I bought this citizenship for a sizeable sum of money.” “But I was born to it,” Sha’ul said."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,22,29,"At once the men who had been about to interrogate him drew back from him; and the commander was afraid too, because he realized that he had put this man who was a Roman citizen in chains."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,22,30,"However, the next day, since he wanted to know the specific charge the Judeans were bringing against him, he released him and ordered the head cohanim and the whole Sanhedrin to meet. Then he brought Sha’ul down and put him in front of them."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,23,1,"Sha’ul looked straight at them and said, “Brothers, I have been discharging my obligations to God with a perfectly clear conscience, right up until today.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,23,2,"But the cohen hagadol, Hananyah, ordered those standing near him to strike him on the mouth."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,23,3,"Then Sha’ul said to him, “God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! Will you sit there judging me according to the Torah, yet in violation of the Torah order me to be struck?”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,23,4,"The men nearby said, “This is the cohen hagadol of God that you’re insulting!”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,23,5,"Sha’ul said, “I didn’t know, brothers, that he was the cohen hagadol; for it says in the Torah, ‘You are not to speak disparagingly of a ruler of your people.’”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,23,6,"But knowing that one part of the Sanhedrin consisted of Tz’dukim and the other of P’rushim, Sha’ul shouted, “Brothers, I myself am a Parush and the son of P’rushim; and it is concerning the hope of the resurrection of the dead that I am being tried!”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,23,7,"When he said this, an argument arose between the P’rushim and the Tz’dukim, and the crowd was divided."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,23,8,For the Tz’dukim deny the resurrection and the existence of angels and spirits; whereas the P’rushim acknowledge both.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,23,9,"So there was a great uproar, with some of the Torah-teachers who were on the side of the P’rushim standing up and joining in — “We don’t find anything wrong with this man; and if a spirit or an angel spoke to him, what of it?”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,23,10,"The dispute became so violent that the commander, fearing that Sha’ul would be torn apart by them, ordered the soldiers to go down, take him by force and bring him back into the barracks."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,23,11,"The following night, the Lord stood by him and said, “Take courage! For just as you have borne a faithful witness to me in Yerushalayim, so now you must bear witness in Rome.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,23,12,"The next day, some of the Judeans formed a conspiracy. They took an oath, saying they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Sha’ul"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,23,13,more than forty were involved in this plot.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,23,14,"They went to the head cohanim and the elders and said, “We have bound ourselves by an oath to taste no food until we have killed Sha’ul."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,23,15,"What you are to do is make it appear to the commander that you and the Sanhedrin want to get more accurate information about Sha’ul’s case, so that he will bring him down to you; while we, for our part, are prepared to kill him before he ever gets here.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,23,16,"But the son of Sha’ul’s sister got wind of the planned ambush, and he went into the barracks and told Sha’ul."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,23,17,"Sha’ul called one of the officers and said, “Take this man up to the commander; he has something to tell him.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,23,18,"So he took him and brought him to the commander and said, “The prisoner Sha’ul called me and asked me to bring this young man to you, because he has something to tell you.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,23,19,"The commander took him by the hand, led him aside privately and asked, “What is it you have to tell me?”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,23,20,"He said, “The Judeans have agreed to ask you tomorrow to bring Sha’ul down to the Sanhedrin on the pretext that they want to investigate his case more thoroughly."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,23,21,"But don’t let yourself be talked into it, because more than forty men are lying in wait for him. They have taken an oath neither to eat nor to drink until they kill him; and they are ready now, only waiting for you to give your consent to their request.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,23,22,"The commander let the young man go, cautioning him, “Don’t tell anyone that you have reported this to me.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,23,23,"Then he summoned two of the captains and said, “Get two hundred infantry soldiers ready to leave for Caesarea at nine o’clock tonight, and seventy mounted cavalry and two hundred spearmen"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,23,24,also provide replacements for Sha’ul’s horse when it gets tired; and bring him through safely to Felix the governor.”
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,23,25,And the commander wrote the following letter
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,23,26,"From: Claudius Lysias
To: His Excellency, Governor Felix:
Greetings!"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,23,27,"This man was seized by the Judeans and was about to be killed by them, when I came on the scene with my troops and rescued him. After learning that he was a Roman citizen"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,23,28,I wanted to understand exactly what they were charging him with; so I brought him down to their “Sanhedrin.”
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,23,29,I found that he was charged in connection with questions of their “Torah” but that there was no charge deserving death or prison.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,23,30,"But when I was informed of a plot against the man, I immediately sent him to you and also ordered his accusers to state their case against him before you."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,23,31,"So the soldiers, following their orders, took Sha’ul during the night and brought him to Antipatris"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,23,32,then returned to the barracks after leaving the cavalry to go on with him.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,23,33,"The cavalry took him to Caesarea, delivered the letter to the governor, and handed Sha’ul over to him."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,23,34,The governor read the letter and asked what province he was from. On learning he was from Cilicia
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,23,35,"he said, “I will give you a full hearing after your accusers have also arrived,” and ordered him to be kept under guard in Herod’s headquarters."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,24,1,"After five days, the cohen hagadol Hananyah came down with some elders and a lawyer named Tertullus, and they presented their case against Sha’ul to the governor."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,24,2,"Sha’ul was called, and Tertullus began to make the charges: “Felix, your Excellency, it is because of you that we enjoy unbroken peace, and it is your foresight that has brought to this nation"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,24,3,so many reforms in so many areas. It is with the utmost gratitude that we receive this.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,24,4,"But, in order not to take up too much of your time, I beg your indulgence to give us a brief hearing."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,24,5,“We have found this man a pest. He is an agitator among all the Jews throughout the world and a ringleader of the sect of the Natzratim.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,24,6,"He even tried to profane the Temple, but we arrested him."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,24,7,
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,24,8,"By questioning this man yourself, you will be able to learn all about the things of which we are accusing him.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,24,9,The Judeans also joined in the accusation and alleged that these were the facts.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,24,10,"When the governor motioned for Sha’ul to speak, he replied, “I know that you have been judge over this nation for a number of years, so I am glad to make my defense."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,24,11,"As you can verify for yourself, it has not been more than twelve days since I went up to worship in Yerushalayim"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,24,12,and neither in the Temple nor in the synagogues nor anywhere else in the city did they find me either arguing with anyone or collecting a crowd.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,24,13,Nor can they give any proof of the things of which they are accusing me.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,24,14,“But this I do admit to you: I worship the God of our fathers in accordance with the Way (which they call a sect). I continue to believe everything that accords with the Torah and everything written in the Prophets.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,24,15,And I continue to have a hope in God — which they too accept — that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,24,16,"Indeed, it is because of this that I make a point of always having a clear conscience in the sight of both God and man."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,24,17,"“After an absence of several years, I came to Yerushalayim to bring a charitable gift to my nation and to offer sacrifices."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,24,18,"It was in connection with the latter that they found me in the Temple. I had been ceremonially purified, I was not with a crowd, and I was not causing a disturbance."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,24,19,But some Jews from the province of Asia — they ought to be here before you to make a charge if they have anything against me!
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,24,20,"Or else, let these men themselves say what crime they found me guilty of when I stood in front of the Sanhedrin"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,24,21,other than this one thing which I shouted out when I was standing among them: ‘I am on trial before you today because I believe in the resurrection of the dead!’”

Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,24,23,"He ordered the captain to keep Sha’ul in custody, but to let him have considerable liberty and not prevent any of his friends from taking care of his needs."

Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,24,25,"But when Sha’ul began to discuss righteousness, self-control and the coming Judgment, Felix became frightened and said, “For the time being, go away! I will send for you when I get a chance.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,24,26,"At the same time, he hoped that Sha’ul would offer him a bribe; so he sent for him rather often and kept talking with him."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,24,27,"After two years, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; but because Felix wanted to grant the Judeans a favor, he left Sha’ul still a prisoner."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,25,1,"Three days after Festus had entered the province, he went up from Caesarea to Yerushalayim."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,25,2,"There the head cohanim and the Judean leaders informed him of the case against Sha’ul, and they asked him"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,25,3,to do them the favor of having the man sent to Yerushalayim. (They had plotted to have him ambushed and killed en route.)
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,25,4,"Festus replied that Sha’ul was being kept under guard in Caesarea, and that he was about to go there shortly himself."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,25,5,"“So,” he said, “let competent men among you come down with me and press charges against the man, if he has done something wrong.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,25,6,"After staying with them at most eight or ten days, Festus went down to Caesarea; and on the following day, he took his seat in court and ordered Sha’ul to be brought in."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,25,7,"When he arrived, the Judeans who had come down from Yerushalayim stood around him, bringing many serious charges against him which they could not prove."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,25,8,"In reply, Sha’ul said, “I have committed no offense — not against the Torah to which the Jews hold, not against the Temple, and not against the Emperor.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,25,9,"But Festus, wanting to do the Judeans a favor, asked Sha’ul, “Would you be willing to go up to Yerushalayim and be tried before me there on these charges?”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,25,10,"Sha’ul replied, “I am standing right now in the court of the Emperor, and this is where I should be tried. I have done no wrong to the Judeans, as you very well know."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,25,11,"If I am a wrongdoer, if I have done something for which I deserve to die, then I am ready to die. But if there is nothing to these charges which they are bringing against me, no one can give me to them just to grant a favor! I appeal to the Emperor!”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,25,12,"Then Festus, after talking with his advisers, answered, “You have appealed to the Emperor; you will go to the Emperor!”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,25,13,"After some days, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,25,14,"Since they were staying on there for some time, Festus had the opportunity to acquaint the king with Sha’ul’s situation. “There is a man here,” he said, “who was left behind in custody by Felix."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,25,15,"When I was in Yerushalayim, the head cohanim and the elders of the Judeans informed me about him and asked me to pronounce judgment against him."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,25,16,"My answer to them was that it is not the custom with Romans to give up an accused man just to grant a favor, before he has met his accusers face to face and had the opportunity to defend himself against the charge."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,25,17,"So when they arrived here with me, I did not delay, but took my seat in court the next day and ordered the man brought in."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,25,18,"“When the accusers stood up, instead of charging him with some serious crime as I had expected"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,25,19,"they disputed with him about certain points of their own religion, and particularly about somebody called Yeshua, who had died, but who Sha’ul claimed was alive."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,25,20,"Being at a loss as to how to investigate such questions, I asked him if he would be willing to go to Yerushalayim and be tried on these matters there."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,25,21,"But since Sha’ul appealed to be kept in custody and have his case decided by His Imperial Majesty, I ordered him held until I could send him to the Emperor.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,25,22,"Agrippa said to Festus, “I myself have been wanting to hear the man.” “Tomorrow,” he replied, “You will hear him.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,25,23,"So the next day, Agrippa and Bernice came with much pageantry; they entered the audience room accompanied by military commanders and the prominent men of the city. Then, at the command of Festus, Sha’ul was brought in."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,25,24,"Festus said, “King Agrippa and all of you here with us, do you see this man? The whole Judean community has complained to me about him both in Yerushalayim and here, crying that he shouldn’t be allowed to remain alive."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,25,25,"But I discovered that he had done nothing that deserves a death sentence. Now when he himself appealed to the Emperor, I decided to send him."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,25,26,"However, I have nothing specific to write to His Majesty about him. This is why I have brought him before all of you, and especially before you, King Agrippa — so that after we have examined him, I might have something to write."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,25,27,It seems irrational to me to send a prisoner without also indicating what the charges against him are.”
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,26,1,"Agrippa said to Sha’ul, “You have permission to speak on your own behalf.” Then Sha’ul motioned with his hand and began his defense"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,26,2,"“King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate that it is before you today that I am defending myself against all the charges made against me by Jews"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,26,3,"because you are so well informed about all the Jewish customs and controversies. Therefore, I beg you to listen to me patiently."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,26,4,"“So then! All Jews know how I lived my life from my youth on, both in my own country and in Yerushalayim."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,26,5,"They have known me for a long time; and if they are willing, they can testify that I have followed the strictest party in our religion — that is, I have lived as a Parush."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,26,6,How ironic it is that I stand on trial here because of my hope in the promise made to our fathers!
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,26,7,"It is the fulfillment of this very promise that our twelve tribes hope to attain, as they resolutely carry on their acts of worship night and day; yet it is in connection with this hope, your Majesty, that I am being accused by Jews!"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,26,8,Why do you people consider it incredible that God raises the dead?
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,26,9,“I used to think it was my duty to do all I could to combat the name of Yeshua from Natzeret
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,26,10,"and in Yerushalayim I did so. After receiving authority from the head cohanim, I myself threw many of God’s people in prison; when they were put to death, I cast my vote against them."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,26,11,"Often I went from one synagogue to another, punishing them and trying to make them blaspheme; and in my wild fury against them, I even went so far as to persecute them in cities outside the country."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,26,12,"“On one such occasion, I was traveling to Dammesek with the full authority and power of the head cohanim."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,26,13,"I was on the road, and it was noon, your Majesty, when I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining around me and my traveling companions."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,26,14,"We all fell to the ground; and then I heard a voice saying to me, in Hebrew, ‘Sha’ul! Sha’ul! Why do you keep persecuting me? It’s hard on you to be kicking against the ox-goads!’"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,26,15,"I said, ‘Who are you, sir?’ and the Lord answered, ‘I am Yeshua, and you are persecuting me!"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,26,16,"But get up, and stand on your feet! I have appeared to you to appoint you to serve and bear witness to what you have already seen of me, and to what you will see when I appear to you in the future."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,26,17,I will deliver you from the People and from the Goyim. I am sending you
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,26,18,"to open their eyes; so that they will turn from darkness to light, from the power of the Adversary to God, and thus receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who have been separated for holiness by putting their trust in me.’"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,26,19,"“So, King Agrippa, I did not disobey the vision from heaven!"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,26,20,"On the contrary, I announced first in Dammesek, then in Yerushalayim and throughout Y’hudah, and also to the Goyim, that they should turn from their sins to God and then do deeds consistent with that repentance."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,26,21,It was because of these things that Jews seized me in the Temple and tried to kill me.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,26,22,"However, I have had God’s help; so to this day, I stand testifying to both small and great, saying nothing but what both the prophets and Moshe said would happen "
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,26,23,"that the Messiah would die, and that he, as the first to rise from the dead, would proclaim light to both the People and the Goyim.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,26,24,"But just as he reached this point in his defense, Festus shouted at the top of his voice, “Sha’ul, you’re out of your mind! So much learning is driving you crazy!”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,26,25,"But Sha’ul said, “No, I am not ‘crazy,’ Festus, your Excellency; on the contrary, I am speaking words of truth and sanity."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,26,26,"For the king understands these matters, so to him I express myself freely, because I am sure that none of these things have been hidden from him. After all, they didn’t happen in some back alley."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,26,27,"King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you believe!”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,26,28,"Agrippa said to Sha’ul, “In this short time, you’re trying to convince me to become Messianic?”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,26,29,"Sha’ul replied, “Whether it takes a short time or a long time, I wish to God that not only you, but also everyone hearing me today, might become just like me except for these chains!”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,26,30,"Then the king got up, and with him the governor and Bernice and the others sitting with them."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,26,31,"After they had left, they said to one another, “This man is doing nothing that deserves either death or prison.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,26,32,"And Agrippa said to Festus, “If he hadn’t appealed to the Emperor, he could have been released.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,1,"Once it had been decided that we should set sail for Italy, they handed Sha’ul and some other prisoners over to an officer of the Emperor’s Regiment named Julius."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,2,"We embarked in a ship from Adramyttium which was about to sail to the ports along the coast of the province of Asia, and put out to sea, accompanied by Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,3,"The next day, we landed at Tzidon; and Julius considerately allowed Sha’ul to go visit his friends and receive what he needed."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,4,"Putting to sea from there, we sailed close to the sheltered side of Cyprus because the winds were against us"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,5,then across the open sea along the coasts of Cilicia and Pamphylia; and so we reached Myra in Lycia.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,6,There the Roman officer found an Alexandrian vessel sailing to Italy and put us aboard.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,7,"For a number of days we made little headway, and we arrived off Cnidus only with difficulty. The wind would not let us continue any farther along the direct route; so we ran down along the sheltered side of Crete from Cape Salmone"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,8,"and, continuing to struggle on, hugging the coast, we reached a place called Pleasant Harbor, near the town of Lasea."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,9,"Since much time had been lost, and continuing the voyage was risky, because it was already past Yom-Kippur, Sha’ul advised them"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,10,"“Men, I can see that our voyage is going to be a catastrophe, not only with huge losses to the cargo and the ship but with loss of our lives as well.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,11,"However, the officer paid more attention to the pilot and the ship’s owner than to what Sha’ul said."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,12,"Moreover, since the harbor was not well suited to sitting out the winter, the majority reached the decision to sail on from there in the hope of reaching Phoenix, another harbor in Crete, and wintering there, where it is protected from the southwest and northwest winds."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,13,"When a gentle southerly breeze began to blow, they thought that they had their goal within grasp; so they raised the anchor and started coasting by Crete close to shore."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,14,"But before long there struck us from land a full gale from the northeast, the kind they call an Evrakilon."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,15,"The ship was caught up and unable to face the wind, so we gave way to it and were driven along."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,16,"As we passed into the lee of a small island called Cauda, we managed with strenuous effort to get control of the lifeboat."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,17,"They hoisted it aboard, then fastened cables tightly around the ship itself to reinforce it. Fearing they might run aground on the Syrtis sandbars, they lowered the topsails and thus continued drifting."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,18,"But because we were fighting such heavy weather, the next day they began to jettison non-essentials"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,19,"and the third day, they threw the ship’s sailing equipment overboard with their own hands."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,20,"For many days neither the sun nor the stars appeared, while the storm continued to rage, until gradually all hope of survival vanished."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,21,"It was then, when they had gone a long time without eating, that Sha’ul stood up in front of them and said, “You should have listened to me and not set out from Crete; if you had, you would have escaped this disastrous loss."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,22,"But now, my advice to you is to take heart; because not one of you will lose his life — only the ship will be lost."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,23,"For this very night, there stood next to me an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,24,"He said, ‘Don’t be afraid, Sha’ul! you have to stand before the Emperor. Look! God has granted you all those who are sailing with you.’"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,25,"So, men, take heart! For I trust God and believe that what I have been told will come true."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,26,"Nevertheless, we have to run aground on some island.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,27,"It was the fourteenth night, and we were still being driven about in the Adriatic Sea, when around midnight the sailors sensed that we were nearing land."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,28,"So they dropped a plumbline and found the water one hundred and twenty feet deep. A little farther on, they took another sounding and found it ninety feet."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,29,"Fearing we might run on the rocks, they let out four anchors from the stern and prayed for daylight to come."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,30,"At this point, the crew made an attempt to abandon ship — they lowered the lifeboat into the sea, pretending that they were about to let out some anchors from the bow."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,31,"Sha’ul said to the officer and the soldiers, “Unless these men remain aboard the ship, you yourselves cannot be saved.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,32,Then the soldiers cut the ropes holding the lifeboat and let it go.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,33,"Just before daybreak, Sha’ul urged them all to eat, saying, “Today is the fourteenth day you have been in suspense, going hungry, eating nothing."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,34,Therefore I advise you to take some food; you need it for your own survival. For not one of you will lose so much as a hair from his head.”
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,35,"When he had said this, he took bread, said the b’rakhah to God in front of everyone, broke it and began to eat."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,36,"With courage restored, they all ate some food themselves."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,37,Altogether there were 276 of us on board the ship.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,38,"After they had eaten all they wanted, they lightened the ship by dumping the grain into the sea."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,39,"When day broke, they didn’t recognize the land; but they noticed a bay with a sand beach, where they decided to run the ship aground if they could."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,40,"So they cut away the anchors and left them in the sea; at the same time, they loosened the ropes that held the rudders out of the water. Then they hoisted the foresail to the wind and headed for the beach."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,41,"But they encountered a place where two currents meet, and ran the vessel aground on the sandbar there. The bow stuck and would not move, while the pounding of the surf began to break up the stern."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,42,"At this point the soldiers’ thought was to kill the prisoners, so that none of them would swim off and escape."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,43,"But the officer, wanting to save Sha’ul, kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to throw themselves overboard first and head for shore"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,27,44,and the rest to use planks or whatever they could find from the ship. Thus it was that everyone reached land safely.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,28,1,"After our escape, we learned that the island was called Malta."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,28,2,"Its people showed extraordinary kindness — it was cold and it had started to rain, so they lit a bonfire and welcomed us all."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,28,3,"Sha’ul had gathered a bundle of sticks and was adding them to the fire, when a poisonous snake, driven out by the heat, fastened itself to his hand."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,28,4,"The islanders saw the creature hanging from Sha’ul’s hand and said to one another, “This man must be a murderer. Even though he escaped the sea, justice has not allowed him to live.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,28,5,But he shook the snake off into the fire and suffered no harm.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,28,6,"They waited, expecting him to swell up or suddenly fall down dead; but after waiting a long time and seeing that nothing amiss was happening to him, they reversed their opinion and said he was a god."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,28,7,"Nearby were lands belonging to the governor of the island, whose name was Publius. He received us in a friendly manner and put us up for three days."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,28,8,"Now it so happened that Publius’ father was lying in bed, sick with fever attacks and dysentery. Sha’ul went in to him, prayed, placed his hands on him and healed him."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,28,9,"After this happened, the rest of those on the island who had ailments came and were healed."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,28,10,"They heaped honors on us; and when the time came for us to sail, they provided the supplies we needed."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,28,11,"After three months, we sailed away on a ship from Alexandria called “Twin Gods,” which had passed the winter at the island."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,28,12,We landed at Syracuse and stayed three days.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,28,13,"From there, we arrived at Rhegium by tacking; but after one day, a south wind sprang up; so we made it to Puteoli the second day."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,28,14,There we found brothers who invited us to spend a week with them. And so we went on toward Rome.
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,28,15,"The brothers there had heard about us and came as far as Appian Market and Three Inns to meet us. When Sha’ul saw them, he thanked God and took courage."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,28,16,"And when we arrived at Rome, the officer allowed Sha’ul to stay by himself, though guarded by a soldier."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,28,17,"After three days Sha’ul called a meeting of the local Jewish leaders. When they had gathered, he said to them: “Brothers, although I have done nothing against either our people or the traditions of our fathers, I was made a prisoner in Yerushalayim and handed over to the Romans."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,28,18,"They examined me and were ready to release me, because I had done nothing to justify a death sentence."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,28,19,"But when the Judeans objected, I was forced to appeal to the Emperor — not that I had any charge to make against my own people."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,28,20,"This is why I have asked to see you and speak with you, for it is because of the hope of Isra’el that I have this chain around me.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,28,21,"They said to him, “We have not received any letters about you from Y’hudah, and none of the brothers who have come from there has reported or said anything bad about you."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,28,22,"But we do think it would be appropriate to hear your views from you, yourself; for all we know about this sect is that people everywhere speak against it.”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,28,23,"So they arranged a day with him and came to his quarters in large numbers. From morning until evening he explained the matter to them, giving a thorough witness about the Kingdom of God and making use of both the Torah of Moshe and the Prophets to persuade them about Yeshua."
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,28,24,Some were convinced by what he said
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,28,25,"while others refused to believe.
So they left, disagreeing among themselves, after Sha’ul had made one final statement: “The Ruach HaKodesh spoke well in saying to your fathers through Yesha‘yahu the prophet"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,28,26,"‘Go to this people and say,
“You will keep on hearing but never understand,
and you will keep on seeing but never perceive"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,28,27,"because the heart of this people has grown thick —
with their ears they barely hear,
and their eyes they have closed,
for fear that they should see with their eyes,
hear with their ears,
understand with their heart,
and do t’shuvah,
so that I could heal them.”’"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,28,28,"Therefore, let it be known to you that this salvation of God has been sent to the Goyim, and they will listen!”"
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,28,29,
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,28,30,Sha’ul remained two whole years in a place he rented for himself; and he continued receiving all who came to see him
Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua,28,31,openly and without hindrance proclaiming the Kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Yeshua the Messiah.
