3 Yochanan,1,4,Nothing gives me greater joy than hearing that my children are living in the truth.
3 Yochanan,1,5,"Dear friend, you are faithful in all the work you are doing for the brothers, even when they are strangers to you."

3 Yochanan,1,9,"I wrote something to the congregation; but Diotrephes, who likes to be the macher among them, doesn’t recognize our authority."
3 Yochanan,1,10,"So if I come, I will bring up everything he is doing, including his spiteful and groundless gossip about us. And as if that weren’t enough for him, he refuses to recognize the brothers’ authority either; moreover, he stops those who want to do so and tries to drive them out of the congregation!"
3 Yochanan,1,11,"Dear friend, don’t imitate the bad, but the good. Those who do what is good are from God; those who do what is bad are not from God."
