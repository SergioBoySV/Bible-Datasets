Messianic Jews,1,1,"In days gone by, God spoke in many and varied ways to the Fathers through the prophets."
Messianic Jews,1,2,"But now, in the acharit-hayamim, he has spoken to us through his Son, to whom he has given ownership of everything and through whom he created the universe."
Messianic Jews,1,3,"This Son is the radiance of the Sh’khinah, the very expression of God’s essence, upholding all that exists by his powerful word; and after he had, through himself, made purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of HaG’dulah BaM’romim."
Messianic Jews,1,4,"So he has become much better than angels, and the name God has given him is superior to theirs."
Messianic Jews,1,5,"For to which of the angels did God ever say,
“You are my Son;
today I have become your Father”?
Also, God never said of any angel,
“I will be his Father,
and he will be my Son.”"
Messianic Jews,1,6,"And again, when God brings his Firstborn into the world, he says,
“Let all God’s angels worship him.”"
Messianic Jews,1,7,"Indeed, when speaking of angels, he says,
“. . . who makes his angels winds
and his servants fiery flames”"
Messianic Jews,1,8,"but to the Son, he says,
“Your throne, O God, will last forever and ever;
you rule your Kingdom with a scepter of equity"
Messianic Jews,1,9,"you have loved righteousness and hated wickedness.
Therefore, O God, your God has anointed you
with the oil of joy in preference to your companions”"
Messianic Jews,1,10,"and,
“In the beginning, Lord, you laid the foundations of the earth;
heaven is the work of your hands."
Messianic Jews,1,11,"They will vanish, but you will remain;
like clothing, they will all grow old"
Messianic Jews,1,12,"and you will fold them up like a coat.
Yes, they will be changed like clothing,
but you remain the same,
your years will never end.”"
Messianic Jews,1,13,"Moreover, to which of the angels has he ever said,
“Sit at my right hand
until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet”?"
Messianic Jews,1,14,"Aren’t they all merely spirits who serve, sent out to help those whom God will deliver?"
Messianic Jews,2,1,"Therefore, we must pay much more careful heed to the things we have heard, so that we will not drift away."
Messianic Jews,2,2,"For if the word God spoke through angels became binding, so that every violation and act of disobedience received its just deserts in full measure"
Messianic Jews,2,3,"then how will we escape if we ignore such a great deliverance? This deliverance, which was first declared by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard him"
Messianic Jews,2,4,"while God also bore witness to it with various signs, wonders and miracles, and with gifts of the Ruach HaKodesh which he distributed as he chose."
Messianic Jews,2,5,For it was not to angels that God subjected the ‘olam haba — which is what we are talking about.
Messianic Jews,2,6,"And there is a place where someone has given this solemn testimony:
“What is mere man, that you concern yourself with him?
or the son of man, that you watch over him with such care?"
Messianic Jews,2,7,"You made him a little lower than the angels,
you crowned him with glory and honor"
Messianic Jews,2,8,"you put everything in subjection under his feet.”
In subjecting everything to him, he left nothing unsubjected to him. However, at present, we don’t see everything subjected to him — at least, not yet."
Messianic Jews,2,9,"But we do see Yeshua — who indeed was made for a little while lower than the angels — now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by God’s grace he might taste death for all humanity."
Messianic Jews,2,10,"For in bringing many sons to glory, it was only fitting that God, the Creator and Preserver of everything, should bring the Initiator of their deliverance to the goal through sufferings."
Messianic Jews,2,11,"For both Yeshua, who sets people apart for God, and the ones being set apart have a common origin — this is why he is not ashamed to call them brothers"
Messianic Jews,2,12,"when he says,
“I will proclaim your name to my brothers;
in the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise.”"
Messianic Jews,2,13,"Also,
“I will put my trust in him, . . .”
and then it goes on,
“Here I am, along with the children God has given me.”"
Messianic Jews,2,14,"Therefore, since the children share a common physical nature as human beings, he became like them and shared that same human nature; so that by his death he might render ineffective the one who had power over death (that is, the Adversary)"
Messianic Jews,2,15,and thus set free those who had been in bondage all their lives because of their fear of death.
Messianic Jews,2,16,"Indeed, it is obvious that he does not take hold of angels to help them; on the contrary,
“He takes hold of the seed of Avraham.”"
Messianic Jews,2,17,"This is why he had to become like his brothers in every respect — so that he might become a merciful and faithful cohen gadol in the service of God, making a kapparah for the sins of the people."
Messianic Jews,2,18,"For since he himself suffered death when he was put to the test, he is able to help those who are being tested now."
Messianic Jews,3,1,"Therefore, brothers whom God has set apart, who share in the call from heaven, think carefully about Yeshua, whom we acknowledge publicly as God’s emissary and as cohen gadol."
Messianic Jews,3,2,"He was faithful to God, who appointed him; just as
“Moshe was faithful in all God’s house.”"
Messianic Jews,3,3,"But Yeshua deserves more honor than Moshe, just as the builder of the house deserves more honor than the house."
Messianic Jews,3,4,"For every house is built by someone, but the one who built everything is God."
Messianic Jews,3,5,"Also, Moshe was faithful in all God’s house, as a servant giving witness to things God would divulge later."
Messianic Jews,3,6,"But the Messiah, as Son, was faithful over God’s house. And we are that house of his, provided we hold firmly to the courage and confidence inspired by what we hope for."
Messianic Jews,3,7,"Therefore, as the Ruach HaKodesh says,
“Today, if you hear God’s voice"
Messianic Jews,3,8,"don’t harden your hearts, as you did in the Bitter Quarrel
on that day in the Wilderness when you put God to the test."
Messianic Jews,3,9,"Yes, your fathers put me to the test;
they challenged me, and they saw my work for forty years!"
Messianic Jews,3,10,"Therefore, I was disgusted with that generation —
I said, ‘Their hearts are always going astray,
they have not understood how I do things’"
Messianic Jews,3,11,"in my anger, I swore
that they would not enter my rest.”"
Messianic Jews,3,12,"Watch out, brothers, so that there will not be in any one of you an evil heart lacking trust, which could lead you to apostatize from the living God!"
Messianic Jews,3,13,"Instead, keep exhorting each other every day, as long as it is called Today, so that none of you will become hardened by the deceit of sin."
Messianic Jews,3,14,"For we have become sharers in the Messiah, provided, however, that we hold firmly to the conviction we began with, right through until the goal is reached."
Messianic Jews,3,15,"Now where it says,
“Today, if you hear God’s voice,
don’t harden your hearts, as you did in the Bitter Quarrel,”"
Messianic Jews,3,16,"who were the people who, after they heard, quarreled so bitterly? All those whom Moshe brought out of Egypt."
Messianic Jews,3,17,"And with whom was God disgusted for forty years? Those who sinned — yes, they fell dead in the Wilderness!"
Messianic Jews,3,18,And to whom was it that he swore that they would not enter his rest? Those who were disobedient.
Messianic Jews,3,19,So we see that they were unable to enter because of lack of trust.
Messianic Jews,4,1,"Therefore, let us be terrified of the possibility that, even though the promise of entering his rest remains, any one of you might be judged to have fallen short of it"
Messianic Jews,4,2,"for Good News has also been proclaimed to us, just as it was to them. But the message they heard didn’t do them any good, because those who heard it did not combine it with trust."
Messianic Jews,4,3,"For it is we who have trusted who enter the rest.
It is just as he said,
“And in my anger, I swore
that they would not enter my rest.”
He swore this even though his works have been in existence since the founding of the universe."
Messianic Jews,4,4,"For there is a place where it is said, concerning the seventh day,
“And God rested on the seventh day from all his works.”"
Messianic Jews,4,5,"And once more, our present text says,
“They will not enter my rest.”"
Messianic Jews,4,6,"Therefore, since it still remains for some to enter it, and those who received the Good News earlier did not enter"
Messianic Jews,4,7,"he again fixes a certain day, “Today,” saying through David, so long afterwards, in the text already given,
“Today, if you hear God’s voice, don’t harden your hearts.”"
Messianic Jews,4,8,"For if Y’hoshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later of another “day.”"
Messianic Jews,4,9,So there remains a Shabbat-keeping for God’s people.
Messianic Jews,4,10,"For the one who has entered God’s rest has also rested from his own works, as God did from his."
Messianic Jews,4,11,"Therefore, let us do our best to enter that rest; so that no one will fall short because of the same kind of disobedience."
Messianic Jews,4,12,"See, the Word of God is alive! It is at work and is sharper than any double-edged sword — it cuts right through to where soul meets spirit and joints meet marrow, and it is quick to judge the inner reflections and attitudes of the heart."
Messianic Jews,4,13,"Before God, nothing created is hidden, but all things are naked and open to the eyes of him to whom we must render an account."
Messianic Jews,4,14,"Therefore, since we have a great cohen gadol who has passed through to the highest heaven, Yeshua, the Son of God, let us hold firmly to what we acknowledge as true."
Messianic Jews,4,15,"For we do not have a cohen gadol unable to empathize with our weaknesses; since in every respect he was tempted just as we are, the only difference being that he did not sin."
Messianic Jews,4,16,"Therefore, let us confidently approach the throne from which God gives grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace in our time of need."
Messianic Jews,5,1,"For every cohen gadol taken from among men is appointed to act on people’s behalf with regard to things concerning God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins."
Messianic Jews,5,2,"He can deal gently with the ignorant and with those who go astray, since he too is subject to weakness."
Messianic Jews,5,3,"Also, because of this weakness, he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins, as well as those of the people."
Messianic Jews,5,4,"And no one takes this honor upon himself, rather, he is called by God, just as Aharon was."
Messianic Jews,5,5,"So neither did the Messiah glorify himself to become cohen gadol; rather, it was the One who said to him,
“You are my Son;
today I have become your Father.”"
Messianic Jews,5,6,"Also, as he says in another place,
“You are a cohen forever,
to be compared with Malki-Tzedek.”"
Messianic Jews,5,7,"During Yeshua’s life on earth, he offered up prayers and petitions, crying aloud and shedding tears, to the One who had the power to deliver him from death; and he was heard because of his godliness."
Messianic Jews,5,8,"Even though he was the Son, he learned obedience through his sufferings."
Messianic Jews,5,9,"And after he had been brought to the goal, he became the source of eternal deliverance to all who obey him"
Messianic Jews,5,10,since he had been proclaimed by God as a cohen gadol to be compared with Malki-Tzedek.
Messianic Jews,5,11,"We have much to say about this subject, but it is hard to explain, because you have become sluggish in understanding."
Messianic Jews,5,12,"For although by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the very first principles of God’s Word all over again! You need milk, not solid food!"
Messianic Jews,5,13,"Anyone who has to drink milk is still a baby, without experience in applying the Word about righteousness."
Messianic Jews,5,14,"But solid food is for the mature, for those whose faculties have been trained by continuous exercise to distinguish good from evil."
Messianic Jews,6,1,"Therefore, leaving behind the initial lessons about the Messiah, let us go on to maturity, not laying again the foundation of turning from works that lead to death, trusting God"
Messianic Jews,6,2,"and instruction about washings, s’mikhah, the resurrection of the dead and eternal punishment."
Messianic Jews,6,3,"And, God willing, this is what we will do."
Messianic Jews,6,4,"For when people have once been enlightened, tasted the heavenly gift, become sharers in the Ruach HaKodesh"
Messianic Jews,6,5,and tasted the goodness of God’s Word and the powers of the ‘olam haba 
Messianic Jews,6,6,"and then have fallen away — it is impossible to renew them so that they turn from their sin, as long as for themselves they keep executing the Son of God on the stake all over again and keep holding him up to public contempt."
Messianic Jews,6,7,For the land that soaks up frequent rains and then brings forth a crop useful to its owners receives a blessing from God
Messianic Jews,6,8,"but if it keeps producing thorns and thistles, it fails the test and is close to being cursed; in the end, it will be burned."
Messianic Jews,6,9,"Now even though we speak this way, dear friends, we are confident that you have the better things that come with being delivered."
Messianic Jews,6,10,For God is not so unfair as to forget your work and the love you showed for him in your past service to his people — and in your present service too.
Messianic Jews,6,11,"However, we want each one of you to keep showing the same diligence right up to the end, when your hope will be realized"
Messianic Jews,6,12,"so that you will not become sluggish, but will be imitators of those who by their trust and patience are receiving what has been promised."
Messianic Jews,6,13,"For when God made his promise to Avraham, he swore an oath to do what he had promised; and since there was no one greater than himself for him to swear by, he swore by himself"
Messianic Jews,6,14,"and said,
“I will certainly bless you,
and I will certainly give you many descendants”"
Messianic Jews,6,15,"and so, after waiting patiently, Avraham saw the promise fulfilled."
Messianic Jews,6,16,"Now people swear oaths by someone greater than themselves, and confirmation by an oath puts an end to all dispute."
Messianic Jews,6,17,"Therefore, when God wanted to demonstrate still more convincingly the unchangeable character of his intentions to those who were to receive what he had promised, he added an oath to the promise"
Messianic Jews,6,18,"so that through two unchangeable things, in neither of which God could lie, we, who have fled to take a firm hold on the hope set before us, would be strongly encouraged."
Messianic Jews,6,19,"We have this hope as a sure and safe anchor for ourselves, a hope that goes right on through to what is inside the parokhet"
Messianic Jews,6,20,"where a forerunner has entered on our behalf, namely, Yeshua, who has become a cohen gadol forever, to be compared with Malki-Tzedek."
Messianic Jews,7,1,"This Malki-Tzedek, king of Shalem, a cohen of God Ha‘Elyon, met Avraham on his way back from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him"
Messianic Jews,7,2,"also Avraham gave him a tenth of everything.
Now first of all, by translation of his name, he is “king of righteousness”; and then he is also king of Shalem, which means “king of peace.”"
Messianic Jews,7,3,"There is no record of his father, mother, ancestry, birth or death; rather, like the Son of God, he continues as a cohen for all time."
Messianic Jews,7,4,Just think how great he was! Even the Patriarch Avraham gave him a tenth of the choicest spoils.
Messianic Jews,7,5,"Now the descendants of Levi who became cohanim have a commandment in the Torah to take a tenth of the income of the people, that is, from their own brothers, despite the fact that they too are descended from Avraham."
Messianic Jews,7,6,"But Malki-Tzedek, even though he was not descended from Levi, took a tenth from Avraham.
Also, he blessed Avraham, the man who received God’s promises"
Messianic Jews,7,7,and it is beyond all dispute that the one who blesses has higher status than the one who receives the blessing.
Messianic Jews,7,8,"Moreover, in the case of the cohanim, the tenth is received by men who die; while in the case of Malki-Tzedek, it is received by someone who is testified to be still alive."
Messianic Jews,7,9,"One might go even further and say that Levi, who himself receives tenths, paid a tenth through Avraham"
Messianic Jews,7,10,inasmuch as he was still in his ancestor Avraham’s body when Malki-Tzedek met him.
Messianic Jews,7,11,"Therefore, if it had been possible to reach the goal through the system of cohanim derived from Levi (since in connection with it, the people were given the Torah), what need would there have been for another, different kind of cohen, the one spoken of as to be compared with Malki-Tzedek and not to be compared with Aharon?"
Messianic Jews,7,12,"For if the system of cohanim is transformed, there must of necessity occur a transformation of Torah."
Messianic Jews,7,13,"The one about whom these things are said belongs to another tribe, from which no one has ever served at the altar"
Messianic Jews,7,14,"for everyone knows that our Lord arose out of Y’hudah, and that Moshe said nothing about this tribe when he spoke about cohanim."
Messianic Jews,7,15,"It becomes even clearer if a “different kind of cohen,” one like Malki-Tzedek, arises"
Messianic Jews,7,16,"one who became a cohen not by virtue of a rule in the Torah concerning physical descent, but by virtue of the power of an indestructible life."
Messianic Jews,7,17,"For it is stated,
“You are a cohen FOREVER,
to be compared with Malki-Tzedek.”"
Messianic Jews,7,18,"Thus, on the one hand, the earlier rule is set aside because of its weakness and inefficacy"
Messianic Jews,7,19,"(for the Torah did not bring anything to the goal); and, on the other hand, a hope of something better is introduced, through which we are drawing near to God."
Messianic Jews,7,20,"What is more, God swore an oath. For no oath was sworn in connection with those who become cohanim now"
Messianic Jews,7,21,"but Yeshua became a cohen by the oath which God swore when he said to him,
“ADONAI has sworn and will not change his mind,
‘You are a cohen forever.’”"
Messianic Jews,7,22,Also this shows how much better is the covenant of which Yeshua has become guarantor.
Messianic Jews,7,23,"Moreover, the present cohanim are many in number, because they are prevented by death from continuing in office."
Messianic Jews,7,24,"But because he lives forever, his position as cohen does not pass on to someone else"
Messianic Jews,7,25,"and consequently, he is totally able to deliver those who approach God through him; since he is alive forever and thus forever able to intercede on their behalf."
Messianic Jews,7,26,"This is the kind of cohen gadol that meets our need — holy, without evil, without stain, set apart from sinners and raised higher than the heavens"
Messianic Jews,7,27,"one who does not have the daily necessity, like the other cohanim g’dolim, of offering up sacrifices first for their own sins and only then for those of the people; because he offered one sacrifice, once and for all, by offering up himself."
Messianic Jews,7,28,"For the Torah appoints as cohanim g’dolim men who have weakness; but the text which speaks about the swearing of the oath, a text written later than the Torah, appoints a Son who has been brought to the goal forever."
Messianic Jews,8,1,Here is the whole point of what we have been saying: we do have just such a cohen gadol as has been described. And he does sit at the right hand of HaG’dulah in heaven.
Messianic Jews,8,2,"There he serves in the Holy Place, that is, in the true Tent of Meeting, the one erected not by human beings but by ADONAI."
Messianic Jews,8,3,For every cohen gadol is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; so this cohen gadol too has to have something he can offer.
Messianic Jews,8,4,"Now if he were on earth, he wouldn’t be a cohen at all, since there already are cohanim offering the gifts required by the Torah."
Messianic Jews,8,5,"But what they are serving is only a copy and shadow of the heavenly original; for when Moshe was about to erect the Tent, God warned him, “See to it that you make everything according to the pattern you were shown on the mountain.”"
Messianic Jews,8,6,"But now the work Yeshua has been given to do is far superior to theirs, just as the covenant he mediates is better. For this covenant has been given as Torah on the basis of better promises."
Messianic Jews,8,7,"Indeed, if the first covenant had not given ground for faultfinding, there would have been no need for a second one."
Messianic Jews,8,8,"For God does find fault with the people when he says,
“‘See! The days are coming,’ says ADONAI,
‘when I will establish
over the house of Isra’el and over the house of Y’hudah
a new covenant."
Messianic Jews,8,9,"“‘It will not be like the covenant
which I made with their fathers
on the day when I took them by their hand
and led them forth out of the land of Egypt;
because they, for their part,
did not remain faithful to my covenant;
so I, for my part,
stopped concerning myself with them,’
says ADONAI."
Messianic Jews,8,10,"“‘For this is the covenant which I will make
with the house of Isra’el after those days,’
says ADONAI:
‘I will put my Torah in their minds
and write it on their hearts;
I will be their God,
and they will be my people."
Messianic Jews,8,11,"“‘None of them will teach his fellow-citizen
or his brother, saying, “Know ADONAI!”
For all will know me,
from the least of them to the greatest"
Messianic Jews,8,12,"because I will be merciful toward their wickednesses
and remember their sins no more.’”"
Messianic Jews,8,13,"By using the term, “new,” he has made the first covenant “old”; and something being made old, something in the process of aging, is on its way to vanishing altogether."
Messianic Jews,9,1,Now the first covenant had both regulations for worship and a Holy Place here on earth.
Messianic Jews,9,2,"A tent was set up, the outer one, which was called the Holy Place; in it were the menorah, the table and the Bread of the Presence."
Messianic Jews,9,3,Behind the second parokhet was a tent called the Holiest Place
Messianic Jews,9,4,"which had the golden altar for burning incense and the Ark of the Covenant, entirely covered with gold. In the Ark were the gold jar containing the man, Aharon’s rod that sprouted and the stone Tablets of the Covenant"
Messianic Jews,9,5,"and above it were the k’ruvim representing the Sh’khinah, casting their shadow on the lid of the Ark — but now is not the time to discuss these things in detail."
Messianic Jews,9,6,"With things so arranged, the cohanim go into the outer tent all the time to discharge their duties"
Messianic Jews,9,7,"but only the cohen hagadol enters the inner one; and he goes in only once a year, and he must always bring blood, which he offers both for himself and for the sins committed in ignorance by the people."
Messianic Jews,9,8,"By this arrangement, the Ruach HaKodesh showed that so long as the first Tent had standing, the way into the Holiest Place was still closed."
Messianic Jews,9,9,This symbolizes the present age and indicates that the conscience of the person performing the service cannot be brought to the goal by the gifts and sacrifices he offers.
Messianic Jews,9,10,"For they involve only food and drink and various ceremonial washings — regulations concerning the outward life, imposed until the time for God to reshape the whole structure."
Messianic Jews,9,11,"But when the Messiah appeared as cohen gadol of the good things that are happening already, then, through the greater and more perfect Tent which is not man-made (that is, it is not of this created world)"
Messianic Jews,9,12,"he entered the Holiest Place once and for all.
And he entered not by means of the blood of goats and calves, but by means of his own blood, thus setting people free forever."
Messianic Jews,9,13,For if sprinkling ceremonially unclean persons with the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer restores their outward purity
Messianic Jews,9,14,"then how much more the blood of the Messiah, who, through the eternal Spirit, offered himself to God as a sacrifice without blemish, will purify our conscience from works that lead to death, so that we can serve the living God!"
Messianic Jews,9,15,"It is because of this death that he is mediator of a new covenant [or will]. Because a death has occurred which sets people free from the transgressions committed under the first covenant, those who have been called may receive the promised eternal inheritance."
Messianic Jews,9,16,"For where there is a will, there must necessarily be produced evidence of its maker’s death"
Messianic Jews,9,17,since a will goes into effect only upon death; it never has force while its maker is still alive.
Messianic Jews,9,18,This is why the first covenant too was inaugurated with blood.
Messianic Jews,9,19,"After Moshe had proclaimed every command of the Torah to all the people, he took the blood of the calves with some water and used scarlet wool and hyssop to sprinkle both the scroll itself and all the people"
Messianic Jews,9,20,"and he said, “This is the blood of the covenant which God has ordained for you.”"
Messianic Jews,9,21,"Likewise, he sprinkled with the blood both the Tent and all the things used in its ceremonies."
Messianic Jews,9,22,"In fact, according to the Torah, almost everything is purified with blood; indeed, without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins."
Messianic Jews,9,23,"Now this is how the copies of the heavenly things had to be purified, but the heavenly things themselves require better sacrifices than these."
Messianic Jews,9,24,"For the Messiah has entered a Holiest Place which is not man-made and merely a copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, in order to appear now on our behalf in the very presence of God."
Messianic Jews,9,25,"Further, he did not enter heaven to offer himself over and over again, like the cohen hagadol who enters the Holiest Place year after year with blood that is not his own"
Messianic Jews,9,26,"for then he would have had to suffer death many times — from the founding of the universe on. But as it is, he has appeared once at the end of the ages in order to do away with sin through the sacrifice of himself."
Messianic Jews,9,27,"Just as human beings have to die once, but after this comes judgment"
Messianic Jews,9,28,"so also the Messiah, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to deal with sin, but to deliver those who are eagerly waiting for him."
Messianic Jews,10,1,"For the Torah has in it a shadow of the good things to come, but not the actual manifestation of the originals. Therefore, it can never, by means of the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, bring to the goal those who approach the Holy Place to offer them."
Messianic Jews,10,2,"Otherwise, wouldn’t the offering of those sacrifices have ceased? For if the people performing the service had been cleansed once and for all, they would no longer have sins on their conscience."
Messianic Jews,10,3,"No, it is quite the contrary — in these sacrifices is a reminder of sins, year after year."
Messianic Jews,10,4,For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins.
Messianic Jews,10,5,"This is why, on coming into the world, he says,
“It has not been your will
to have an animal sacrifice and a meal offering;
rather, you have prepared for me a body."
Messianic Jews,10,6,"No, you have not been pleased
with burnt offerings and sin offerings."
Messianic Jews,10,7,"Then I said, ‘Look!
In the scroll of the book
it is written about me.
I have come to do your will.’”"
Messianic Jews,10,8,"In saying first, “You neither willed nor were pleased with animal sacrifices, meal offerings, burnt offerings and sin offerings,” things which are offered in accordance with the Torah"
Messianic Jews,10,9,"and then, “Look, I have come to do your will”; he takes away the first system in order to set up the second."
Messianic Jews,10,10,"It is in connection with this will that we have been separated for God and made holy, once and for all, through the offering of Yeshua the Messiah’s body."
Messianic Jews,10,11,"Now every cohen stands every day doing his service, offering over and over the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins."
Messianic Jews,10,12,"But this one, after he had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, sat down at the right hand of God"
Messianic Jews,10,13,from then on to wait until his enemies be made a footstool for his feet.
Messianic Jews,10,14,For by a single offering he has brought to the goal for all time those who are being set apart for God and made holy.
Messianic Jews,10,15,And the Ruach HaKodesh too bears witness to us; for after saying
Messianic Jews,10,16,"“ ‘This is the covenant which I will make
with them after those days,’ says ADONAI:
‘I will put my Torah on their hearts,
and write it on their minds . . . ,’ ”"
Messianic Jews,10,17,"he then adds,
“ ‘And their sins and their wickednesses
I will remember no more.’ ”"
Messianic Jews,10,18,"Now where there is forgiveness for these, an offering for sins is no longer needed."
Messianic Jews,10,19,"So, brothers, we have confidence to use the way into the Holiest Place opened by the blood of Yeshua."
Messianic Jews,10,20,"He inaugurated it for us as a new and living way through the parokhet, by means of his flesh."
Messianic Jews,10,21,We also have a great cohen over God’s household.
Messianic Jews,10,22,"Therefore, let us approach the Holiest Place with a sincere heart, in the full assurance that comes from trusting — with our hearts sprinkled clean from a bad conscience and our bodies washed with pure water."
Messianic Jews,10,23,"Let us continue holding fast to the hope we acknowledge, without wavering; for the One who made the promise is trustworthy."
Messianic Jews,10,24,"And let us keep paying attention to one another, in order to spur each other on to love and good deeds"
Messianic Jews,10,25,"not neglecting our own congregational meetings, as some have made a practice of doing, but, rather, encouraging each other.
And let us do this all the more as you see the Day approaching."
Messianic Jews,10,26,"For if we deliberately continue to sin after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins"
Messianic Jews,10,27,"but only the terrifying prospect of Judgment, of raging fire that will consume the enemies."
Messianic Jews,10,28,Someone who disregards the Torah of Moshe is put to death without mercy on the word of two or three witnesses.
Messianic Jews,10,29,"Think how much worse will be the punishment deserved by someone who has trampled underfoot the Son of God; who has treated as something common the blood of the covenant which made him holy; and who has insulted the Spirit, giver of God’s grace!"
Messianic Jews,10,30,"For the One we know is the One who said,
“Vengeance is my responsibility;
I will repay,”
and then said,
“ADONAI will judge his people.”"
Messianic Jews,10,31,It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God!
Messianic Jews,10,32,"But remember the earlier days, when, after you had received the light, you endured a hard struggle with sufferings."
Messianic Jews,10,33,"Sometimes you were publicly disgraced and persecuted, while at other times you stood loyally by those who were treated this way."
Messianic Jews,10,34,"For you shared the sufferings of those who had been put in prison. Also when your possessions were seized, you accepted it gladly; since you knew that what you possessed was better and would last forever."
Messianic Jews,10,35,"So don’t throw away that courage of yours, which carries with it such a great reward."
Messianic Jews,10,36,"For you need to hold out; so that, by having done what God wills, you may receive what he has promised."
Messianic Jews,10,37,"For
“There is so, so little time!
The One coming will indeed come,
he will not delay."
Messianic Jews,10,38,"But the person who is righteous
will live his life by trusting,
and if he shrinks back,
I will not be pleased with him.”"
Messianic Jews,10,39,"However, we are not the kind who shrink back and are destroyed; on the contrary, we keep trusting and thus preserve our lives!"
Messianic Jews,11,1,"Trusting is being confident of what we hope for, convinced about things we do not see."
Messianic Jews,11,2,It was for this that Scripture attested the merit of the people of old.
Messianic Jews,11,3,"By trusting, we understand that the universe was created through a spoken word of God, so that what is seen did not come into being out of existing phenomena."
Messianic Jews,11,4,"By trusting, Hevel offered a greater sacrifice than Kayin; because of this, he was attested as righteous, with God giving him this testimony on the ground of his gifts. Through having trusted, he still continues to speak, even though he is dead."
Messianic Jews,11,5,"By trusting, Hanokh was taken away from this life without seeing death — “He was not to be found, because God took him away” — for he has been attested as having been, prior to being taken away, well pleasing to God."
Messianic Jews,11,6,"And without trusting, it is impossible to be well pleasing to God, because whoever approaches him must trust that he does exist and that he becomes a Rewarder to those who seek him out."
Messianic Jews,11,7,"By trusting, Noach, after receiving divine warning about things as yet unseen, was filled with holy fear and built an ark to save his household. Through this trusting, he put the world under condemnation and received the righteousness that comes from trusting."
Messianic Jews,11,8,"By trusting, Avraham obeyed, after being called to go out to a place which God would give him as a possession; indeed, he went out without knowing where he was going."
Messianic Jews,11,9,"By trusting, he lived as a temporary resident in the Land of the promise, as if it were not his, staying in tents with Yitz’chak and Ya‘akov, who were to receive what was promised along with him."
Messianic Jews,11,10,"For he was looking forward to the city with permanent foundations, of which the architect and builder is God."
Messianic Jews,11,11,"By trusting, he received potency to father a child, even when he was past the age for it, as was Sarah herself; because he regarded the One who had made the promise as trustworthy."
Messianic Jews,11,12,"Therefore this one man, who was virtually dead, fathered descendants
as numerous as the stars in the sky,
and as countless as the grains of the sand on the seashore."
Messianic Jews,11,13,"All these people kept on trusting until they died, without receiving what had been promised. They had only seen it and welcomed it from a distance, while acknowledging that they were aliens and temporary residents on the earth."
Messianic Jews,11,14,For people who speak this way make it clear that they are looking for a fatherland.
Messianic Jews,11,15,"Now if they were to keep recalling the one they left, they would have an opportunity to return"
Messianic Jews,11,16,"but as it is, they aspire to a better fatherland, a heavenly one. This is why God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared for them a city."
Messianic Jews,11,17,"By trusting, Avraham, when he was put to the test, offered up Yitz’chak as a sacrifice. Yes, he offered up his only son, he who had received the promises"
Messianic Jews,11,18,"to whom it had been said, “What is called your ‘seed’ will be in Yitz’chak.”"
Messianic Jews,11,19,"For he had concluded that God could even raise people from the dead! And, figuratively speaking, he did so receive him."
Messianic Jews,11,20,"By trusting, Yitz’chak in his blessings over Ya‘akov and Esav made reference to events yet to come."
Messianic Jews,11,21,"By trusting, Ya‘akov, when he was dying, blessed each of Yosef’s sons, leaning on his walking-stick as he bowed in prayer."
Messianic Jews,11,22,"By trusting, Yosef, near the end of his life, remembered about the Exodus of the people of Isra’el and gave instructions about what to do with his bones."
Messianic Jews,11,23,"By trusting, the parents of Moshe hid him for three months after he was born, because they saw that he was a beautiful child, and they weren’t afraid of the king’s decree."
Messianic Jews,11,24,"By trusting, Moshe, after he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter."
Messianic Jews,11,25,He chose being mistreated along with God’s people rather than enjoying the passing pleasures of sin.
Messianic Jews,11,26,"He had come to regard abuse suffered on behalf of the Messiah as greater riches than the treasures of Egypt, for he kept his eyes fixed on the reward."
Messianic Jews,11,27,"By trusting, he left Egypt, not fearing the king’s anger; he persevered as one who sees the unseen."
Messianic Jews,11,28,"By trusting, he obeyed the requirements for the Pesach, including the smearing of the blood, so that the Destroyer of the firstborn would not touch the firstborn of Isra’el."
Messianic Jews,11,29,"By trusting, they walked through the Red Sea as through dry land; when the Egyptians tried to do it, the sea swallowed them up."
Messianic Jews,11,30,"By trusting, the walls of Yericho fell down — after the people had marched around them for seven days."
Messianic Jews,11,31,"By trusting, Rachav the prostitute welcomed the spies and therefore did not die along with those who were disobedient."
Messianic Jews,11,32,"What more should I say? There isn’t time to tell about Gid‘on, Barak, Shimshon, Yiftach, David, Sh’mu’el and the prophets"
Messianic Jews,11,33,"who, through trusting, conquered kingdoms, worked righteousness, received what was promised, shut the mouths of lions"
Messianic Jews,11,34,"quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, had their weakness turned to strength, grew mighty in battle and routed foreign armies."
Messianic Jews,11,35,"Women received back their dead resurrected; other people were stretched on the rack and beaten to death, refusing to be ransomed, so that they would gain a better resurrection."
Messianic Jews,11,36,"Others underwent the trials of being mocked and whipped, then chained and imprisoned."
Messianic Jews,11,37,"They were stoned, sawed in two, murdered by the sword; they went about clothed in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted, mistreated"
Messianic Jews,11,38,"wandering about in deserts and mountains, living in caves and holes in the ground! The world was not worthy of them!"
Messianic Jews,11,39,"All of these had their merit attested because of their trusting. Nevertheless, they did not receive what had been promised"
Messianic Jews,11,40,"because God had planned something better that would involve us, so that only with us would they be brought to the goal."
Messianic Jews,12,1,"So then, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us, too, put aside every impediment — that is, the sin which easily hampers our forward movement — and keep running with endurance in the contest set before us"
Messianic Jews,12,2,"looking away to the Initiator and Completer of that trusting, Yeshua — who, in exchange for obtaining the joy set before him, endured execution on a stake as a criminal, scorning the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God."
Messianic Jews,12,3,"Yes, think about him who endured such hostility against himself from sinners, so that you won’t grow tired or become despondent."
Messianic Jews,12,4,You have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood in the contest against sin.
Messianic Jews,12,5,"Also you have forgotten the counsel which speaks with you as sons:
“My son, don’t despise the discipline of ADONAI
or become despondent when he corrects you."
Messianic Jews,12,6,"For ADONAI disciplines those he loves
and whips everyone he accepts as a son.”"
Messianic Jews,12,7,Regard your endurance as discipline; God is dealing with you as sons. For what son goes undisciplined by his father?
Messianic Jews,12,8,"All legitimate sons undergo discipline; so if you don’t, you’re a mamzer and not a son!"
Messianic Jews,12,9,"Furthermore, we had physical fathers who disciplined us, and we respected them; how much more should we submit to our spiritual Father and live!"
Messianic Jews,12,10,For they disciplined us only for a short time and only as best they could; but he disciplines us in a way that provides genuine benefit to us and enables us to share in his holiness.
Messianic Jews,12,11,"Now, all discipline, while it is happening, does indeed seem painful, not enjoyable; but for those who have been trained by it, it later produces its peaceful fruit, which is righteousness."
Messianic Jews,12,12,"So,
strengthen your drooping arms,
and steady your tottering knees"
Messianic Jews,12,13,"and
make a level path for your feet;
so that what has been injured will not get wrenched out of joint but rather will be healed."
Messianic Jews,12,14,Keep pursuing shalom with everyone and the holiness without which no one will see the Lord.
Messianic Jews,12,15,"See to it that no one misses out on God’s grace, that no root of bitterness springing up causes trouble and thus contaminates many"
Messianic Jews,12,16,"and that no one is sexually immoral, or godless like Esav, who in exchange for a single meal gave up his rights as the firstborn."
Messianic Jews,12,17,"For you know that afterwards, when he wanted to obtain his father’s blessing, he was rejected; indeed, even though he sought it with tears, his change of heart was to no avail."
Messianic Jews,12,18,"For you have not come to a tangible mountain, to an ignited fire, to darkness, to murk, to a whirlwind"
Messianic Jews,12,19,"to the sound of a shofar, and to a voice whose words made the hearers beg that no further message be given to them "
Messianic Jews,12,20,"for they couldn’t bear what was being commanded them, “If even an animal touches the mountain, it is to be stoned to death”"
Messianic Jews,12,21,"and so terrifying was the sight that Moshe said, “I am quaking with dread.”"
Messianic Jews,12,22,"On the contrary, you have come to Mount Tziyon, that is, the city of the living God, heavenly Yerushalayim; to myriads of angels in festive assembly"
Messianic Jews,12,23,to a community of the firstborn whose names have been recorded in heaven; to a Judge who is God of everyone; to spirits of righteous people who have been brought to the goal
Messianic Jews,12,24,"to the mediator of a new covenant, Yeshua; and to the sprinkled blood that speaks better things than that of Hevel."
Messianic Jews,12,25,"See that you don’t reject the One speaking! For if those did not escape who rejected him when he gave divine warning on earth, think how much less we will escape if we turn away from him when he warns from heaven."
Messianic Jews,12,26,"Even then, his voice shook the earth; but now, he has made this promise:
“One more time I will shake
not only the earth, but heaven too!”"
Messianic Jews,12,27,"And this phrase, “one more time,” makes clear that the things shaken are removed, since they are created things, so that the things not shaken may remain."
Messianic Jews,12,28,"Therefore, since we have received an unshakeable Kingdom, let us have grace, through which we may offer service that will please God, with reverence and fear."
Messianic Jews,12,29,"For indeed,
“Our God is a consuming fire!”"
Messianic Jews,13,1,Let brotherly friendship continue
Messianic Jews,13,2,"but don’t forget to be friendly to outsiders; for in so doing, some people, without knowing it, have entertained angels."
Messianic Jews,13,3,"Remember those in prison and being mistreated, as if you were in prison with them and undergoing their torture yourselves."
Messianic Jews,13,4,"Marriage is honorable in every respect; and, in particular, sex within marriage is pure. But God will indeed punish fornicators and adulterers."
Messianic Jews,13,5,"Keep your lives free from the love of money; and be satisfied with what you have; for God himself has said, “I will never fail you or abandon you.”"
Messianic Jews,13,6,"Therefore, we say with confidence,
“ADONAI is my helper; I will not be afraid —
what can a human being do to me?”"
Messianic Jews,13,7,"Remember your leaders, those who spoke God’s message to you. Reflect on the results of their way of life, and imitate their trust "
Messianic Jews,13,8,"Yeshua the Messiah is the same yesterday, today and forever."
Messianic Jews,13,9,"Do not be carried away by various strange teachings; for what is good is for the heart to be strengthened by grace, not by foods. People who have made these the focus of their lives have not benefited thereby."
Messianic Jews,13,10,We have an altar from which those who serve in the Tent are not permitted to eat.
Messianic Jews,13,11,"For the cohen hagadol brings the blood of animals into the Holiest Place as a sin offering, but their bodies are burned outside the camp."
Messianic Jews,13,12,"So too Yeshua suffered death outside the gate, in order to make the people holy through his own blood."
Messianic Jews,13,13,"Therefore, let us go out to him who is outside the camp and share his disgrace."
Messianic Jews,13,14,"For we have no permanent city here; on the contrary, we seek the one to come."
Messianic Jews,13,15,"Through him, therefore, let us offer God a sacrifice of praise continually. For this is the natural product of lips that acknowledge his name."
Messianic Jews,13,16,"But don’t forget doing good and sharing with others, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased."
Messianic Jews,13,17,"Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch over your lives, as people who will have to render an account. So make it a task of joy for them, not one of groaning; for that is of no advantage to you."
Messianic Jews,13,18,"Keep praying for us, for we are certain that we have a clear conscience and want to conduct ourselves properly in everything we do."
Messianic Jews,13,19,"And all the more I beg you to do this, so that I may be restored to you that much sooner."
Messianic Jews,13,20,"The God of shalom brought up from the dead the great Shepherd of the sheep, our Lord Yeshua, by the blood of an eternal covenant."
Messianic Jews,13,21,"May that God equip you with every good thing you need to do his will; and may he do in us whatever pleases him, through Yeshua the Messiah. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen."
Messianic Jews,13,22,"Now I urge you, brothers, to bear with my message of exhortation; for I have written you only briefly."
Messianic Jews,13,23,"Know that our brother Timothy has been released. If he comes soon enough, I will bring him with me when I come to see you."
Messianic Jews,13,24,Greet all your leaders and all God’s people. The people from Italy send greetings to you.
Messianic Jews,13,25,Grace be with you all.
