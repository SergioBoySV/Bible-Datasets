Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,4,2,"Instantly I was in the Spirit, and there before me in heaven stood a throne, and on the throne Someone was sitting."

In the center, around the throne, were four living beings covered with eyes in front and behind."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,4,7,"The first living being was like a lion, the second living being was like an ox, the third living being had a face that looked human, and the fourth living being was like a flying eagle."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,4,8,"Each of the four living beings had six wings and was covered with eyes inside and out; and day and night they never stop saying,
“Holy, holy, holy is ADONAI, God of heaven’s armies
the One who was, who is and who is coming!”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,4,9,"And whenever the living beings give glory, honor and thanks to the One sitting on the throne, to the One who lives forever and ever"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,4,10,"the twenty-four elders fall down before the One sitting on the throne, who lives forever and ever, and worship him. They throw their crowns in front of the throne and say"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,4,11,"“You are worthy, ADONAI Eloheinu,
to have glory, honor and power,
because you created all things —
yes, because of your will they were created
and came into being!”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,5,1,Next I saw in the right hand of the One sitting on the throne a scroll with writing on both sides and sealed with seven seals
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,5,2,"and I saw a mighty angel proclaiming in a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,5,3,"But no one in heaven, on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or look inside it."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,5,4,"I cried and cried, because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or look inside it."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,5,5,"One of the elders said to me, “Don’t cry. Look, the Lion of the tribe of Y’hudah, the Root of David, has won the right to open the scroll and its seven seals.”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,5,6,"Then I saw standing there with the throne and the four living beings, in the circle of the elders, a Lamb that appeared to have been slaughtered. He had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the sevenfold Spirit of God sent out into all the earth."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,5,7,He came and took the scroll out of the right hand of the One sitting on the throne.
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,5,8,"When he took the scroll, the four living beings and the twenty-four elders fell down in front of the Lamb. Each one held a harp and gold bowls filled with pieces of incense, which are the prayers of God’s people"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,5,9,"and they sang a new song,
“You are worthy to take the scroll and break its seals;
because you were slaughtered;
at the cost of blood you ransomed for God
persons from every tribe, language, people and nation."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,5,10,"You made them into a kingdom for God to rule,
cohanim to serve him;
and they will rule over the earth.”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,5,11,"Then I looked, and I heard the sound of a vast number of angels — thousands and thousands, millions and millions! They were all around the throne, the living beings and the elders"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,5,12,"and they shouted out,
“Worthy is the slaughtered Lamb to receive
power, riches, wisdom, strength,
honor, glory and praise!”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,5,13,"And I heard every creature in heaven, on earth, under the earth and on the sea — yes, everything in them — saying,
“To the One sitting on the throne
and to the Lamb
belong praise, honor, glory and power
forever and ever!”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,5,14,"The four living beings said, “Amen!” and the elders fell down and worshipped."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,6,1,"Next I watched as the Lamb broke the first of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living beings say in a thundering voice, “Go!”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,6,2,"I looked, and there in front of me was a white horse; its rider had a bow and was given a crown; and he rode off as a conqueror to conquer."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,6,3,"When he broke the second seal, I heard the second living being say, “Go!”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,6,4,"Another horse went out, a red one; and its rider was given the power to take peace away from the earth and make people slaughter each other. He was given a great sword."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,6,5,"When he broke the third seal, I heard the third living being say, “Go!” I looked, and there in front of me was a black horse, and its rider held in his hand a pair of scales."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,6,6,"Then I heard what sounded like a voice from among the four living beings say, “Two pounds of wheat for a day’s wages! Six pounds of barley for the same price! But don’t damage the oil or the wine!”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,6,7,"When he broke the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living being say, “Go!”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,6,8,"I looked, and there in front of me was a pallid, sickly-looking horse. Its rider’s name was Death, and Sh’ol followed behind him. They were given authority to kill one-quarter of the world by war, by famine, by plagues and with the wild animals of the earth."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,6,9,"When the Lamb broke the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been put to death for proclaiming the Word of God, that is, for bearing witness."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,6,10,"They cried out in a loud voice, “Sovereign Ruler, HaKadosh, the True One, how long will it be before you judge the people living on earth and avenge our blood?”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,6,11,"Each of them was given a white robe; and they were told to wait a little longer, until the full number of their fellow-servants should be reached, of their brothers who would be killed, just as they had been."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,6,12,"Then I watched as he broke the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake, the sun turned black as sackcloth worn in mourning, and the full moon became blood-red."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,6,13,The stars fell from heaven to earth just as a fig tree drops its figs when shaken by a strong wind.
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,6,14,"The sky receded like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved from its place."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,6,15,"Then the earth’s kings, the rulers, the generals, the rich and the mighty — indeed, everyone, slave and free — hid himself in caves and among the rocks in the mountains"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,6,16,"and said to the mountains and rocks, “Fall on us, and hide us from the face of the One sitting on the throne and from the fury of the Lamb!"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,6,17,"For the Great Day of their fury has come, and who can stand?”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,7,1,"After this, I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth, so that no wind would blow on the land, on the sea or on any tree."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,7,2,"I saw another angel coming up from the east with a seal from the living God, and he shouted to the four angels who had been given power to harm the land and the sea"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,7,3,“Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads!”
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,7,4,"I heard how many were sealed — 144,000 from every tribe of the people of Isra’el"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,8,1,"When the Lamb broke the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for what seemed like half an hour."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,8,2,"Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and they were given seven shofars."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,8,3,"Another angel came and stood at the altar with a gold incense-bowl, and he was given a large quantity of incense to add to the prayers of all God’s people"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,8,4,on the gold altar in front of the throne. The smoke of the incense went up with the prayers of God’s people from the hand of the angel before God.
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,8,5,"Then the angel took the incense-bowl, filled it with fire from the altar and threw it down onto the earth; and there followed peals of thunder, voices, flashes of lightning and an earthquake."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,8,6,Now the seven angels with the seven shofars prepared to sound them.
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,8,7,"The first one sounded his shofar; and there came hail and fire mingled with blood, and it was thrown down upon the earth. A third of the earth was burned up, a third of the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned up."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,8,8,"The second angel sounded his shofar, and what looked like an enormous blazing mountain was hurled into the sea. A third of the sea turned to blood"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,8,9,"a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,8,10,"The third angel sounded his shofar; and a great star, blazing like a torch, fell from the sky onto a third of the rivers and onto the springs of water."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,8,11,"The name of the star was “Bitterness,” and a third of the water became bitter, and many people died from the water that had been turned bitter."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,8,12,"The fourth angel sounded his shofar; and a third of the sun was struck, also a third of the moon and a third of the stars; so that a third of them were darkened, the day had a third less light, and the night likewise."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,8,13,"Then I looked, and I heard a lone eagle give a loud cry, as it flew in mid-heaven, “Woe! Woe! Woe to the people living on earth, because of the remaining blasts from the three angels who have yet to sound their shofars!”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,9,1,"The fifth angel sounded his shofar; and I saw a star that had fallen out of heaven onto the earth, and he was given the key to the shaft leading down to the Abyss."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,9,2,"He opened the shaft of the Abyss, and there went up smoke from the shaft like the smoke of a huge furnace; the sun was darkened, and the sky too, by the smoke from the shaft."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,9,3,"Then out of the smoke onto the earth came locusts, and they were given power like the power scorpions have on earth."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,9,4,"They were instructed not to harm the grass on the earth, any green plant or any tree, but only the people who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,9,5,"The locusts were not allowed to kill them, only to inflict pain on them for five months; and the pain they caused was like the pain of a scorpion sting."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,9,6,"In those days people will seek death but will not find it; they will long to die, but death will elude them."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,9,7,"Now these locusts looked like horses outfitted for battle. On their heads were what looked like crowns of gold, and their faces were like human faces."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,9,8,"They had hair like women’s hair, and their teeth were like those of lions."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,9,9,"Their chests were like iron breastplates, and the sound their wings made was like the roar of many horses and chariots rushing into battle."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,9,10,"They had tails like those of scorpions, with stings; and in their tails was their power to hurt people for five months."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,9,11,"They had as king over them the angel of the Abyss, whose name in Hebrew is “Abaddon” and in our language, “Destroyer.”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,9,12,"The first woe has passed, but there are still two woes to come."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,9,13,"The sixth angel sounded his shofar, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the gold altar before God"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,9,14,"saying to the sixth angel, the one with the shofar, “Release the four angels that are bound at the great river Euphrates!”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,9,15,"And they were released. These four angels had been kept ready for this moment, for this day and month and year, to kill a third of mankind"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,9,16,and the number of cavalry soldiers was two hundred million! — I heard the number.
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,9,17,"Here is how the horses looked in the vision: the riders had breastplates that were fire-red, iris-blue and sulfur-yellow; the horses’ heads were like lions’ heads; and from their mouths issued fire, smoke and sulfur."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,9,18,"It was these three plagues that killed a third of mankind — the fire, smoke and sulfur issuing from the horses’ mouths."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,9,19,"For the power of the horses was in their mouths — and also in their tails, for their tails were like snakes with heads, and with them they could cause injury."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,9,20,"The rest of mankind, those who were not killed by these plagues, even then did not turn from what they had made with their own hands — they did not stop worshipping demons and idols made of gold, silver, bronze, stone and wood, which cannot see or hear or walk."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,9,21,"Nor did they turn from their murdering, their involvement with the occult and with drugs, their sexual immorality or their stealing."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,10,1,"Next I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven. He was dressed in a cloud, with a rainbow over his head; his face was like the sun, his legs like columns of fire"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,10,2,and he had a little scroll lying open in his hand. He planted his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,10,3,"and shouted in a voice as loud as the roar of a lion; and when he shouted, seven thunderclaps sounded with voices that spoke."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,10,4,"When the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from heaven say,
“Seal up the things the seven thunders said,
do not write them down!”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,10,5,Then the angel I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted his right hand toward heaven
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,10,6,"and swore by the One who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and what is in it, earth and what is in it, and the sea and what is in it: “There will be no more delay"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,10,7,"on the contrary, in the days of the sound from the seventh angel when he sounds his shofar, the hidden plan of God will be brought to completion, the Good News as he proclaimed it to his servants the prophets.”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,10,8,"Next the voice which I had heard from heaven spoke to me again and said, “Go, take the scroll lying open in the hand of the angel standing on the sea and on the land!”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,10,9,"So I went over to the angel and asked him to give me the little scroll; and he said to me, “Take it and eat it. It will turn your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey.”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,10,10,"I took the little scroll from the angel’s hand and ate it; and in my mouth it was sweet as honey; but after I had swallowed it, my stomach turned bitter."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,10,11,"Then I was told, “You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, languages and kings.”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,11,1,"I was given a measuring rod like a stick and told, “Get up, and measure the Temple of God and the altar, and count how many people are worshipping there!"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,11,2,"But the court outside the Temple, leave that out; don’t measure it; because it has been given to the Goyim, and they will trample over the holy city for forty-two months."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,11,3,"“Also I will give power to my two witnesses; and they will prophesy for 1,260 days, dressed in sackcloth.”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,11,4,These are the two olive trees and the two menorahs standing before the Lord of the earth.
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,11,5,"If anyone tries to do them harm, fire comes out of their mouth and consumes their enemies — yes, if anyone tries to harm them, that is how he must die."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,11,6,"They have the authority to shut up the sky, so that no rain falls during the period of their prophesying; also they have the authority to turn the waters into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they want."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,11,7,"When they finish their witnessing, the beast coming up out of the Abyss will fight against them, overcome them and kill them"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,11,8,"and their dead bodies will lie in the main street of the great city whose name, to reflect its spiritual condition, is “S’dom” and “Egypt” — the city where their Lord was executed on a stake."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,11,9,"Some from the nations, tribes, languages and peoples see their bodies for three-and-a-half days and do not permit the corpses to be placed in a tomb."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,11,10,"The people living in the Land rejoice over them, they celebrate and send each other gifts, because these two prophets tormented them so."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,11,11,"But after the three-and-a-half days a breath of life from God entered them, they stood up on their feet, and great fear fell on those who saw them."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,11,12,"Then the two heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, “Come up here!” And they went up into heaven in a cloud, while their enemies watched them."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,11,13,"In that hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city collapsed. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were awestruck and gave glory to the God of heaven."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,11,14,"The second woe has passed; see, the third woe is coming quickly"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,11,15,"The seventh angel sounded his shofar; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying,
“The kingdom of the world
has become the Kingdom
of our Lord and his Messiah,
and he will rule forever and ever!”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,11,16,The twenty-four elders sitting on their thrones in God’s presence fell on their faces and worshipped God
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,11,17,"saying,
“We thank you, ADONAI,
God of heaven’s armies,
the One who is and was,
that you have taken your power
and have begun to rule."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,11,18,"“The Goyim raged.
But now your rage has come,
the time for the dead to be judged,
the time for rewarding your servants the prophets
and your holy people,
those who stand in awe of your name,
both small and great.
It is also the time for destroying
those who destroy the earth.”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,11,19,"Then the Temple of God in heaven was opened, and the Ark of the Covenant was seen in his Temple; and there were flashes of lightning, voices, peals of thunder, an earthquake and violent hail."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,12,1,"Now a great sign was seen in heaven — a woman clothed with the sun, under her feet the moon, and on her head a crown of twelve stars."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,12,2,"She was pregnant and about to give birth, and she screamed in the agony of labor."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,12,3,"Another sign was seen in heaven there was a great red dragon with seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads were seven royal crowns."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,12,4,"Its tail swept a third of the stars out of heaven and threw them down to the earth. It stood in front of the woman about to give birth, so that it might devour the child the moment it was born."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,12,5,"She gave birth to a son, a male child, the one who will rule all the nations with a staff of iron. But her child was snatched up to God and his throne"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,12,6,"and she fled into the desert, where she has a place prepared by God so that she can be taken care of for 1,260 days."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,12,7,"Next there was a battle in heaven — Mikha’el and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,12,8,"But it was not strong enough to win, so that there was no longer any place for them in heaven."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,12,9,"The great dragon was thrown out, that ancient serpent, also known as the Devil and Satan [the Adversary], the deceiver of the whole world. He was hurled down to the earth, and his angels were hurled down with him."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,12,10,"Then I heard a loud voice in heaven saying,
“Now have come God’s victory, power and kingship,
and the authority of his Messiah;
because the Accuser of our brothers,
who accuses them day and night before God,
has been thrown out!"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,12,11,"“They defeated him because of the Lamb’s blood
and because of the message of their witness.
Even when facing death
they did not cling to life."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,12,12,"“Therefore, rejoice, heaven and you who live there!
But woe to you, land and sea,
for the Adversary has come down to you,
and he is very angry, because he knows that his time is short!”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,12,13,"When the dragon saw that he had been hurled down to the earth, he went in pursuit of the woman who had given birth to the male child."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,12,14,"But the woman was given the two wings of the great eagle, so that she could fly to her place in the desert, where she is taken care of for a season and two seasons and half a season, away from the serpent’s presence."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,12,15,"The serpent spewed water like a river out of its mouth after the woman, in order to sweep her away in the flood"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,12,16,but the land came to her rescue — it opened its mouth and swallowed up the river which the dragon had spewed out of its mouth.
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,12,17,"The dragon was infuriated over the woman and went off to fight the rest of her children, those who obey God’s commands and bear witness to Yeshua."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,12,18,Then the dragon stood on the seashore
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,13,1,"and I saw a beast come up out of the sea, with ten horns and seven heads. On its horns were ten royal crowns and on its heads blasphemous names."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,13,2,"The beast which I saw was like a leopard, but with feet like those of a bear and a mouth like the mouth of a lion. To it the dragon gave its power, its throne and great authority."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,13,3,"One of the heads of the beast appeared to have received a fatal wound, but its fatal wound was healed, and the whole earth followed after the beast in amazement."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,13,4,"They worshipped the dragon, because he had given his authority to the beast; and they worshipped the beast, saying,
“Who is like the beast?
Who can fight against it?”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,13,5,It was given a mouth speaking arrogant blasphemies; and it was given authority to act for forty-two months.
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,13,6,"So it opened its mouth in blasphemies against God to insult his name and his Sh’khinah, and those living in heaven"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,13,7,"it was allowed to make war on God’s holy people and to defeat them; and it was given authority over every tribe, people, language and nation."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,13,8,Everyone living on earth will worship it except those whose names are written in the Book of Life belonging to the Lamb slaughtered before the world was founded.
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,13,9,"Those who have ears, let them hear!"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,13,10,"“If anyone is meant for captivity,
into captivity he goes!
If anyone is to be killed with the sword,
with the sword he is to be killed!”
This is when God’s holy people must persevere and trust!"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,13,11,"Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth. It had two horns like those of a lamb, but it spoke like a dragon."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,13,12,"It exercises all the authority of the first beast in its presence; and it makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, the one whose fatal wound had been healed."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,13,13,"It performs great miracles, even causing fire to come down from heaven onto the earth as people watch."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,13,14,"It deceives the people living on earth by the miracles it is allowed to perform in the presence of the beast, and it tells them to make an image honoring the beast that was struck by the sword but came alive again."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,13,15,"It was allowed to put breath into the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast could even speak; and it was allowed to cause anyone who would not worship the image of the beast to be put to death."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,13,16,"Also it forces everyone — great and small, rich and poor, free and slave — to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,13,17,"preventing anyone from buying or selling unless he has the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number of its name."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,13,18,"This is where wisdom is needed; those who understand should count the number of the beast, for it is the number of a person, and its number is 666."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,14,1,"Then I looked, and there was the Lamb standing on Mount Tziyon; and with him were 144,000 who had his name and his Father’s name written on their foreheads."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,14,2,I heard a sound from heaven like the sound of rushing waters and like the sound of pealing thunder; the sound I heard was also like that of harpists playing on their harps.
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,14,3,"They were singing a new song before the throne and before the four living beings and the elders, and no one could learn the song except the 144,000 who have been ransomed from the world."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,14,4,"These are the ones who have not defiled themselves with women, for they are virgins; they follow the Lamb wherever he goes; they have been ransomed from among humanity as firstfruits for God and the Lamb"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,14,5,on their lips no lie was found — they are without defect.
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,14,6,"Next I saw another angel flying in mid-heaven with everlasting Good News to proclaim to those living on the earth — to every nation, tribe, language and people."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,14,7,"In a loud voice he said,
“Fear God, give him glory,
for the hour has come when he will pass judgment!
Worship the One who made heaven and earth,
the sea and the springs of water!”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,14,8,"Another angel, a second one, followed, saying,
“She has fallen! She has fallen!
Bavel the Great!
She made all the nations drink the wine
of God’s fury caused by her whoring!”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,14,9,"Another angel, a third one, followed them and said in a loud voice, “If anyone worships the beast and its image and receives the mark on his forehead or on his hand"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,14,10,he will indeed drink the wine of God’s fury poured undiluted into the cup of his rage. He will be tormented by fire and sulfur before the holy angels and before the Lamb
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,14,11,"and the smoke from their tormenting goes up forever and ever. They have no rest, day or night, those who worship the beast and its image and those who receive the mark of its name.”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,14,12,"This is when perseverance is needed on the part of God’s people, those who observe his commands and exercise Yeshua’s faithfulness."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,14,13,"Next I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Write: ‘How blessed are the dead who die united with the Lord, from now on!’ ‘Yes,’ says the Spirit, ‘now they may rest from their efforts, for the things they have accomplished follow along with them.’”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,14,14,"Then I looked, and there before me was a white cloud. Sitting on the cloud was someone like a Son of Man with a gold crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,14,15,"Another angel came out of the Temple and shouted to the one sitting on the cloud, “Start using your sickle to reap, because the time to reap has come — the earth’s harvest is ripe!”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,14,16,"The one sitting on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth was harvested."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,14,17,"Another angel came out of the Temple in heaven, and he too had a sharp sickle."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,14,18,"Then out from the altar went yet another angel, who was in charge of the fire; and he called in a loud voice to the one with the sharp sickle, “Use your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of grapes from the earth’s vine, because they are ripe!”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,14,19,"The angel swung his sickle down onto the earth, gathered the earth’s grapes and threw them into the great winepress of God’s fury."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,14,20,"The winepress was trodden outside the city, and blood flowed from the winepress as high as the horses’ bridles for two hundred miles!"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,15,1,"Then I saw another sign in heaven, a great and wonderful one — seven angels with the seven plagues that are the final ones; because with them, God’s fury is finished."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,15,2,"I saw what looked like a sea of glass mixed with fire. Those defeating the beast, its image and the number of its name were standing by the sea of glass, holding harps which God had given them."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,15,3,"They were singing the song of Moshe, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb:
“Great and wonderful are the things you have done,
ADONAI, God of heaven’s armies!
Just and true are your ways,
king of the nations!"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,15,4,"ADONAI, who will not fear and glorify your name?
because you alone are holy.
All nations will come and worship before you,
for your righteous deeds have been revealed.”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,15,5,"After this I looked, and the sanctuary (that is, the Tent of Witness in heaven) was opened"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,15,6,and out of the sanctuary came the seven angels with the seven plagues. They were dressed in clean bright linen and had gold belts around their chests.
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,15,7,"One of the four living beings gave to the seven angels seven gold bowls filled with the fury of God, who lives forever and ever."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,15,8,"Then the sanctuary was filled with smoke from God’s Sh’khinah, that is, from his power; and no one could enter the sanctuary until the seven plagues of the seven angels had accomplished their purpose."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,16,1,"I heard a loud voice from the sanctuary say to the seven angels, “Go, and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of God’s fury!”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,16,2,"So the first one went and poured his bowl onto the earth, and disgusting and painful sores appeared on all the people who had the mark of the beast and worshipped its image."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,16,3,"The second one poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became like the blood of a dead person, and every living thing in the sea died."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,16,4,"The third one poured out his bowl into the rivers and springs of water, and they turned to blood."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,16,5,"Then I heard the angel of the waters say,
“O HaKadosh, the One who is and was,
you are just in these judgments of yours."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,16,6,"They poured out the blood of your people and your prophets,
so you have made them drink blood. They deserve it!”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,16,7,"Then I heard the altar say,
“Yes, ADONAI, God of heaven’s armies,
your judgments are true and just!”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,16,8,"The fourth one poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was permitted to burn people with fire."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,16,9,"People were burned by the intense heat; yet they cursed the name of God, who had the authority over these plagues, instead of turning from their sins to give him glory."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,16,10,"The fifth one poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and its kingdom grew dark. People gnawed on their tongues from the pain"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,16,11,"yet they cursed the God of heaven because of their pains and sores, and did not turn from their sinful deeds."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,16,12,"The sixth one poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water dried up, in order to prepare the way for the kings from the east."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,16,13,"And I saw three unclean spirits that looked like frogs; they came from the mouth of the dragon, from the mouth of the beast and from the mouth of the false prophet."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,16,14,They are miracle-working demonic spirits which go out to the kings of the whole inhabited world to assemble them for the War of the Great Day of ADONAI-Tzva’ot.
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,16,15,"(“Look! I am coming like a thief! How blessed are those who stay alert and keep their clothes clean, so that they won’t be walking naked and be publicly put to shame!”)"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,16,16,And they gathered the kings to the place which in Hebrew is called Har Megiddo.
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,16,17,"The seventh one poured out his bowl on the air, and a loud voice came out of the Temple from the throne, saying, “It is done!”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,16,18,"There were flashes of lightning, voices and peals of thunder; and there was a massive earthquake, such as has never occurred since mankind has been on earth, so violent was the earthquake."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,16,19,"The great city was split into three parts, the cities of the nations fell, and God remembered Bavel the Great and made her drink the wine from the cup of his raging fury."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,16,20,"Every island fled, and no mountains were to be found."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,16,21,"And huge seventy-pound hailstones fell on people from the sky. But the people cursed God for the plague of hail, that it was such a terrible plague."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,17,1,"Then came one of the angels with the seven bowls; and he said to me, “Come, I will show you the judgment of the great whore who is sitting by many waters."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,17,2,"The kings of the earth went whoring with her, and the people living on earth have become drunk from the wine of her whoring.”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,17,3,"He carried me off in the Spirit to a desert, and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast filled with blasphemous names and having seven heads and ten horns."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,17,4,"The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet and glittered with gold, precious stones and pearls. In her hand was a gold cup filled with the obscene and filthy things produced by her whoring."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,17,5,"On her forehead was written a name with a hidden meaning,
BAVEL THE GREAT
MOTHER OF WHORES AND OF
THE EARTH’S OBSCENITIES"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,17,6,"I saw the woman drunk from the blood of God’s people, that is, from the blood of the people who testify about Yeshua.
On seeing her, I was altogether astounded."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,17,7,"Then the angel said to me, “Why are you astounded? I will tell you the hidden meaning of the woman and of the beast with seven heads and ten horns that was carrying her."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,17,8,"The beast you saw once was, now is not, and will come up from the Abyss; but it is on its way to destruction. The people living on earth whose names have not been written in the Book of Life since the founding of the world will be astounded to see the beast that once was, now is not, but is to appear."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,17,9,This calls for a mind with wisdom: the seven heads are seven hills on which the woman is sitting; also they are seven kings 
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,17,10,"five have fallen, one is living now and the other is yet to come; and when he does come, he must remain only a little while."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,17,11,The beast which once was and now is not is an eighth king; it comes from the seven and is on its way to destruction.
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,17,12,"The ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet begun to rule, but they receive power as kings for one hour, along with the beast."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,17,13,"They have one mind, and they hand over their power and authority to the beast."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,17,14,"They will go to war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will defeat them, because he is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those who are called, chosen and faithful will overcome along with him.”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,17,15,"Then he said to me, “The waters that you saw, where the whore is sitting, are peoples, crowds, nations and languages."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,17,16,"As for the ten horns that you saw and the beast, they will hate the whore, bring her to ruin, leave her naked, eat her flesh and consume her with fire."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,17,17,"For God put it in their hearts to do what will fulfill his purpose, that is, to be of one mind and give their kingdom to the beast until God’s words have accomplished their intent."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,17,18,And the woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth.”
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,18,1,"After these things, I saw another angel coming down from heaven. He had great authority, the earth was lit up by his splendor."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,18,2,"He cried out in a strong voice,
“She has fallen! She has fallen!
Bavel the Great!
She has become a home for demons,
a prison for every unclean spirit,
a prison for every unclean, hated bird."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,18,3,"“For all the nations have drunk of the wine
of God’s fury caused by her whoring —
yes, the kings of the earth went whoring with her,
and from her unrestrained love of luxury
the world’s businessmen have grown rich.”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,18,4,"Then I heard another voice out of heaven say:
“My people, come out of her!
so that you will not share in her sins,
so that you will not be infected by her plagues"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,18,5,"for her sins are a sticky mass piled up to heaven,
and God has remembered her crimes."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,18,6,"“Render to her as she rendered to others!
Pay her back double for what she has done!
Use the cup in which she has brewed
to brew her a double-sized drink!"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,18,7,"“Give her as much torment and sorrow
as the glory and luxury she gave herself!
For in her heart she says, ‘I sit a queen —
I am not a widow, I will never see sorrow.’"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,18,8,"“Therefore, her plagues will come in a single day —
death, sorrow and famine;
and she will be burned with fire,
because ADONAI, God, her Judge, is mighty”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,18,9,The kings of the earth who went whoring with her and shared her luxury will sob and wail over her when they see the smoke as she burns.
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,18,10,"Standing at a distance, for fear of her torment, they will say,
“Oh no! The great city!
Bavel, the mighty city!
In a single hour
your judgment has come!”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,18,11,"The world’s businessmen weep and mourn over her, because no one is buying their merchandise any more "
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,18,12,"stocks of gold and silver, gems and pearls, fine linen and purple, silk and scarlet, all rare woods, all ivory goods, all kinds of things made of scented wood, brass, iron and marble"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,18,13,"cinnamon, cardamom, incense, myrrh, frankincense, wine, oil, flour, grain, cattle, sheep, horses, chariots — and bodies — and people’s souls."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,18,14,"The fruits you lusted for with all your heart have gone!
All the luxury and flashiness have been destroyed, never to return!"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,18,15,"The sellers of these things, who got rich from her, will stand at a distance, for fear of her torment, weeping and mourning"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,18,16,"and saying,
“Oh no! The great city used to wear fine linen, purple and scarlet!
She glittered with gold, precious stones and pearls!"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,18,17,"Such great wealth —
in a single hour, ruined!”
All the ship masters, passengers, sailors and everyone making his living from the sea stood at a distance"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,18,18,"and cried out when they saw the smoke as she burned, “What city was like the great city?”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,18,19,"And they threw dust on their heads as they wept and mourned, saying,
“Oh no! The great city!
The abundance of her wealth
made all the ship owners rich!
In a single hour she is ruined!”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,18,20,"Rejoice over her, heaven!
Rejoice, people of God,
emissaries and prophets!
For in judging her, God has vindicated you."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,18,21,"Then a mighty angel picked up a boulder the size of a great millstone, and hurled it into the sea, saying,
“With violence like this
will the great city Bavel
be hurled down,
never to be found again!"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,18,22,"“The sound of harpists and musicians,
flute-players and trumpeters
will never again be heard in you.
No worker of any trade
will ever again be found in you,
the sound of a mill
will never again be heard in you"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,18,23,"the light of a lamp
will never again shine in you,
the voice of bridegroom and bride
will never again be heard in you.
“For your businessmen were the most powerful on earth,
all the nations were deceived by your magic spell."
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,18,24,"“In her was found the blood of prophets and of God’s people,
indeed, of all who have ever been slaughtered on earth!”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,19,1,"After these things, I heard what sounded like the roar of a huge crowd in heaven, shouting,
“Halleluyah!
The victory, the glory, the power of our God!"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,19,2,"For his judgments are true and just.
He has judged the great whore
who corrupted the earth with her whoring.
He has taken vengeance on her
who has the blood of his servants on her hands.”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,19,3,"And a second time they said,
“Halleluyah!
Her smoke goes up forever and ever!”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,19,4,"The twenty-four elders and the four living beings fell down and worshipped God, sitting on the throne, and said,
“Amen!
Halleluyah!”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,19,5,"A voice went out from the throne, saying,
“Praise our God, all you his servants,
you who fear him, small and great!”"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,19,6,"Then I heard what sounded like the roar of a huge crowd, like the sound of rushing waters, like loud peals of thunder, saying,
“Halleluyah!
ADONAI, God of heaven’s armies,
has begun his reign!"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,19,7,"“Let us rejoice and be glad!
Let us give him the glory!
For the time has come for the
wedding of the Lamb,
and his Bride has prepared herself "
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,19,8,"fine linen, bright and clean
has been given her to wear.”
(“Fine linen” means the righteous deeds of God’s people.)"
Revelation of Yeshua to Yochanan,19,9,"The angel said to me, “Write: ‘How blessed are those who have been invited to the wedding feast of the Lamb!’” Then he added, “These are God’s very words.”"
