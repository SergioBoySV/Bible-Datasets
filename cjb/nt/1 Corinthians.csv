1 Corinthians,1,1,"From: Sha’ul, called by God’s will to be an emissary of the Messiah Yeshua; and from brother Sosthenes"
1 Corinthians,1,2,"To: God’s Messianic community in Corinth, consisting of those who have been set apart by Yeshua the Messiah and called to be God’s holy people — along with everyone everywhere who calls on the name of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah, their Lord as well as ours"
1 Corinthians,1,3,Grace to you and shalom from God our Father and the Lord Yeshua the Messiah.
1 Corinthians,1,4,I thank my God always for you because of God’s love and kindness given to you through the Messiah Yeshua
1 Corinthians,1,5,"in that you have been enriched by him in so many ways, particularly in power of speech and depth of knowledge."
1 Corinthians,1,6,"Indeed, the testimony about the Messiah has become firmly established in you"
1 Corinthians,1,7,so that you are not lacking any spiritual gift and are eagerly awaiting the revealing of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah.
1 Corinthians,1,8,He will enable you to hold out until the end and thus be blameless on the Day of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah 
1 Corinthians,1,9,"God is trustworthy: it was he who called you into fellowship with his Son, Yeshua the Messiah, our Lord."
1 Corinthians,1,10,"Nevertheless, brothers, I call on you in the name of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah to agree, all of you, in what you say, and not to let yourselves remain split into factions but be restored to having a common mind and a common purpose."
1 Corinthians,1,11,"For some of Chloe’s people have made it known to me, my brothers, that there are quarrels among you."
1 Corinthians,1,12,"I say this because one of you says, “I follow Sha’ul”; another says, “I follow Apollos”; another, “I follow Kefa”; while still another says, “I follow the Messiah!”"
1 Corinthians,1,13,Has the Messiah been split in pieces? Was it Sha’ul who was put to death on a stake for you? Were you immersed into the name of Sha’ul?
1 Corinthians,1,14,I thank God that I didn’t immerse any of you except Crispus and Gaius 
1 Corinthians,1,15,otherwise someone might say that you were indeed immersed into my name.
1 Corinthians,1,16,"(Oh yes, I did also immerse Stephanas and his household; beyond that, I can’t remember whether I immersed anyone else.)"
1 Corinthians,1,17,"For the Messiah did not send me to immerse but to proclaim the Good News — and to do it without relying on “wisdom” that consists of mere rhetoric, so as not to rob the Messiah’s execution-stake of its power."
1 Corinthians,1,18,"For the message about the execution-stake is nonsense to those in the process of being destroyed, but to us in the process of being saved it is the power of God."
1 Corinthians,1,19,"Indeed, the Tanakh says,
“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise
and frustrate the intelligence of the intelligent.”"
1 Corinthians,1,20,"Where does that leave the philosopher, the Torah-teacher, or any of today’s thinkers? Hasn’t God made this world’s wisdom look pretty foolish?"
1 Corinthians,1,21,"For God’s wisdom ordained that the world, using its own wisdom, would not come to know him. Therefore God decided to use the “nonsense” of what we proclaim as his means of saving those who come to trust in it."
1 Corinthians,1,22,Precisely because Jews ask for signs and Greeks try to find wisdom
1 Corinthians,1,23,"we go on proclaiming a Messiah executed on a stake as a criminal! To Jews this is an obstacle, and to Greeks it is nonsense"
1 Corinthians,1,24,"but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, this same Messiah is God’s power and God’s wisdom!"
1 Corinthians,1,25,"For God’s “nonsense” is wiser than humanity’s “wisdom.”
And God’s “weakness” is stronger than humanity’s “strength.”"
1 Corinthians,1,26,"Just look at yourselves, brothers — look at those whom God has called! Not many of you are wise by the world’s standards, not many wield power or boast noble birth."
1 Corinthians,1,27,But God chose what the world considers nonsense in order to shame the wise; God chose what the world considers weak in order to shame the strong
1 Corinthians,1,28,and God chose what the world looks down on as common or regards as nothing in order to bring to nothing what the world considers important
1 Corinthians,1,29,so that no one should boast before God.
1 Corinthians,1,30,"It is his doing that you are united with the Messiah Yeshua. He has become wisdom for us from God, and righteousness and holiness and redemption as well!"
1 Corinthians,1,31,"Therefore — as the Tanakh says — “Let anyone who wants to boast, boast about ADONAI.”"
1 Corinthians,2,1,"As for me, brothers, when I arrived among you, it was not with surpassing eloquence or wisdom that I came announcing to you the previously concealed truth about God"
1 Corinthians,2,2,"for I had decided that while I was with you I would forget everything except Yeshua the Messiah, and even him only as someone who had been executed on a stake as a criminal."
1 Corinthians,2,3,"Also I myself was with you as somebody weak, nervous and shaking all over from fear"
1 Corinthians,2,4,and neither the delivery nor the content of my message relied on compelling words of “wisdom” but on a demonstration of the power of the Spirit
1 Corinthians,2,5,so that your trust might not rest on human wisdom but on God’s power.
1 Corinthians,2,6,"Yet there is a wisdom that we are speaking to those who are mature enough for it. But it is not the wisdom of this world or of this world’s leaders, who are in the process of passing away."
1 Corinthians,2,7,"On the contrary, we are communicating a secret wisdom from God which has been hidden until now but which, before history began, God had decreed would bring us glory."
1 Corinthians,2,8,"Not one of this world’s leaders has understood it; because if they had, they would not have executed the Lord from whom this glory flows."
1 Corinthians,2,9,"But, as the Tanakh says,
“No eye has seen, no ear has heard
and no one’s heart has imagined
all the things that God has prepared
for those who love him.”"
1 Corinthians,2,10,"It is to us, however, that God has revealed these things. How? Through the Spirit. For the Spirit probes all things, even the profoundest depths of God."
1 Corinthians,2,11,For who knows the inner workings of a person except the person’s own spirit inside him? So too no one knows the inner workings of God except God’s Spirit.
1 Corinthians,2,12,"Now we have not received the spirit of the world but the Spirit of God, so that we might understand the things God has so freely given us."
1 Corinthians,2,13,"These are the things we are talking about when we avoid the manner of speaking that human wisdom would dictate and instead use a manner of speaking taught by the Spirit, by which we explain things of the Spirit to people who have the Spirit."
1 Corinthians,2,14,"Now the natural man does not receive the things from the Spirit of God — to him they are nonsense! Moreover, he is unable to grasp them, because they are evaluated through the Spirit."
1 Corinthians,2,15,"But the person who has the Spirit can evaluate everything, while no one is in a position to evaluate him."
1 Corinthians,2,16,"For who has known the mind of ADONAI?
Who will counsel him?
But we have the mind of the Messiah!"
1 Corinthians,3,1,"As for me, brothers, I couldn’t talk to you as spiritual people but as worldly people, as babies, so far as experience with the Messiah is concerned."
1 Corinthians,3,2,"I gave you milk, not solid food, because you were not yet ready for it. But you aren’t ready for it now either!"
1 Corinthians,3,3,For you are still worldly! Isn’t it obvious from all the jealousy and quarrelling among you that you are worldly and living by merely human standards?
1 Corinthians,3,4,"For when one says, “I follow Sha’ul” and another, “I follow Apollos,” aren’t you being merely human?"
1 Corinthians,3,5,"After all, what is Apollos? What is Sha’ul? Only servants through whom you came to trust. Indeed, it was the Lord who brought you to trust through one of us or through another."
1 Corinthians,3,6,"I planted the seed, and Apollos watered it, but it was God who made it grow."
1 Corinthians,3,7,"So neither the planter nor the waterer is anything, only God who makes things grow "
1 Corinthians,3,8,"planter and waterer are the same.
However, each will be rewarded according to his work."
1 Corinthians,3,9,"For we are God’s co-workers; you are God’s field, God’s building."
1 Corinthians,3,10,"Using the grace God gave me, I laid a foundation, like a skilled master-builder; and another man is building on it. But let each one be careful how he builds."
1 Corinthians,3,11,"For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Yeshua the Messiah."
1 Corinthians,3,12,"Some will use gold, silver or precious stones in building on this foundation; while others will use wood, grass or straw."
1 Corinthians,3,13,"But each one’s work will be shown for what it is; the Day will disclose it, because it will be revealed by fire — the fire will test the quality of each one’s work."
1 Corinthians,3,14,"If the work someone has built on the foundation survives, he will receive a reward"
1 Corinthians,3,15,"if it is burned up, he will have to bear the loss: he will still escape with his life, but it will be like escaping through a fire."
1 Corinthians,3,16,Don’t you know that you people are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit lives in you?
1 Corinthians,3,17,"So if anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him. For God’s temple is holy, and you yourselves are that temple."
1 Corinthians,3,18,"Let no one fool himself. If someone among you thinks he is wise (by this world’s standards), let him become “foolish,” so that he may become really wise."
1 Corinthians,3,19,"For the wisdom of this world is nonsense, as far as God is concerned; inasmuch as the Tanakh says, “He traps the wise in their own cleverness,”"
1 Corinthians,3,20,"and again, “ADONAI knows that the thoughts of the wise are worthless.”"
1 Corinthians,3,21,"So let no one boast about human beings, for all things are yours "
1 Corinthians,3,22,whether Sha’ul or Apollos or Kefa or the world or life or death or the present or the future: they all belong to you
1 Corinthians,3,23,"and you belong to the Messiah, and the Messiah belongs to God."
1 Corinthians,4,1,"So, you should regard us as the Messiah’s servants, as trustees of God’s secret truths."
1 Corinthians,4,2,Now the one thing that is asked of a trustee is that he be found trustworthy.
1 Corinthians,4,3,"And it matters very little to me how I am evaluated by you or by any human court; in fact, I don’t even evaluate myself."
1 Corinthians,4,4,"I am not aware of anything against me, but this does not make me innocent. The one who is evaluating me is the Lord."
1 Corinthians,4,5,"So don’t pronounce judgment prematurely, before the Lord comes; for he will bring to light what is now hidden in darkness; he will expose the motives of people’s hearts; and then each will receive from God whatever praise he deserves."
1 Corinthians,4,6,"Now in what I have said here, brothers, I have used myself and Apollos as examples to teach you not to go beyond what the Tanakh says, proudly taking the side of one leader against another."
1 Corinthians,4,7,"After all, what makes you so special? What do you have that you didn’t receive as a gift? And if in fact it was a gift, why do you boast as if it weren’t?"
1 Corinthians,4,8,"You are glutted already? You are rich already? You have become kings, even though we are not? Well, I wish you really were kings, so that we might share the kingship with you!"
1 Corinthians,4,9,"For I think God has been placing us emissaries on display at the tail of the parade, like men condemned to die in the public arena: we have become a spectacle before the whole universe, angels as well as men."
1 Corinthians,4,10,"For the Messiah’s sake we are fools, but united with the Messiah you are wise! We are weak, but you are strong; you are honored, but we are dishonored."
1 Corinthians,4,11,"Till this very moment we go hungry and thirsty, we are dressed in rags, we are treated roughly, we wander from place to place"
1 Corinthians,4,12,"we exhaust ourselves working with our own hands for our living. When we are cursed, we keep on blessing; when we are persecuted, we go on putting up with it"
1 Corinthians,4,13,"when we are slandered, we continue making our appeal. We are the world’s garbage, the scum of the earth — yes, to this moment!"
1 Corinthians,4,14,"I am not writing you this to make you feel ashamed, but, as my dear children, to confront you and get you to change."
1 Corinthians,4,15,"For even if you have ten thousand trainers in connection with the Messiah, you do not have many fathers; for in connection with the Messiah Yeshua it was I who became your father by means of the Good News."
1 Corinthians,4,16,Therefore I urge you to imitate me.
1 Corinthians,4,17,"This is why I have sent you Timothy, my beloved and trustworthy child in the Lord. He will remind you of the way of life I follow in union with the Messiah Yeshua and teach everywhere in every congregation."
1 Corinthians,4,18,"When I didn’t come to visit you, some of you became arrogant."
1 Corinthians,4,19,"But I am coming to you soon, if the Lord wills; and I will take cognizance not of the talk of these arrogant people but of their power."
1 Corinthians,4,20,For the Kingdom of God is not a matter of words but of power.
1 Corinthians,4,21,Which do you prefer — should I come to you with a stick? or with love in a spirit of gentleness?
1 Corinthians,5,1,"It is actually being reported that there is sexual sin among you, and it is sexual sin of a kind that is condemned even by pagans — a man is living with his stepmother!"
1 Corinthians,5,2,And you stay proud? Shouldn’t you rather have felt some sadness that would have led you to remove from your company the man who has done this thing?
1 Corinthians,5,3,"For I myself, even though I am absent physically, am with you spiritually; and I have already judged the man who has done this as if I were present."
1 Corinthians,5,4,"In the name of the Lord Yeshua, when you are assembled, with me present spiritually and the power of our Lord Yeshua among us"
1 Corinthians,5,5,"hand over such a person to the Adversary for his old nature to be destroyed, so that his spirit may be saved in the Day of the Lord."
1 Corinthians,5,6,"Your boasting is not good. Don’t you know the saying, “It takes only a little hametz to leaven a whole batch of dough?”"
1 Corinthians,5,7,"Get rid of the old hametz, so that you can be a new batch of dough, because in reality you are unleavened. For our Pesach lamb, the Messiah, has been sacrificed."
1 Corinthians,5,8,"So let us celebrate the Seder not with leftover hametz, the hametz of wickedness and evil, but with the matzah of purity and truth."
1 Corinthians,5,9,In my earlier letter I wrote you not to associate with people who engage in sexual immorality.
1 Corinthians,5,10,"I didn’t mean the sexually immoral people outside your community, or the greedy, or the thieves or the idol-worshippers — for then you would have to leave the world altogether!"
1 Corinthians,5,11,"No, what I wrote you was not to associate with anyone who is supposedly a brother but who also engages in sexual immorality, is greedy, worships idols, is abusive, gets drunk or steals. With such a person you shouldn’t even eat!"
1 Corinthians,5,12,For what business is it of mine to judge outsiders? Isn’t it those who are part of the community that you should be judging?
1 Corinthians,5,13,God will judge those who are outside. Just expel the evildoer from among yourselves.
1 Corinthians,6,1,How dare one of you with a complaint against another go to court before pagan judges and not before God’s people?
1 Corinthians,6,2,"Don’t you know that God’s people are going to judge the universe? If you are going to judge the universe, are you incompetent to judge these minor matters?"
1 Corinthians,6,3,"Don’t you know that we will judge angels, not to mention affairs of everyday life?"
1 Corinthians,6,4,"So if you require judgments about matters of everyday life, why do you put them in front of men who have no standing in the Messianic Community?"
1 Corinthians,6,5,"I say, shame on you! Can it be that there isn’t one person among you wise enough to be able to settle a dispute between brothers?"
1 Corinthians,6,6,"Instead, a brother brings a lawsuit against another brother, and that before unbelievers!"
1 Corinthians,6,7,"Actually, if you are bringing lawsuits against each other, it is already a defeat for you. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated?"
1 Corinthians,6,8,"Instead, you yourselves wrong and cheat; and you do it to your own brothers!"
1 Corinthians,6,9,"Don’t you know that unrighteous people will have no share in the Kingdom of God? Don’t delude yourselves — people who engage in sex before marriage, who worship idols, who engage in sex after marriage with someone other than their spouse, who engage in active or passive homosexuality"
1 Corinthians,6,10,"who steal, who are greedy, who get drunk, who assail people with contemptuous language, who rob — none of them will share in the Kingdom of God."
1 Corinthians,6,11,"Some of you used to do these things. But you have cleansed yourselves, you have been set apart for God, you have come to be counted righteous through the power of the Lord Yeshua the Messiah and the Spirit of our God."
1 Corinthians,6,12,"You say, “For me, everything is permitted”? Maybe, but not everything is helpful. “For me, everything is permitted”? Maybe, but as far as I am concerned, I am not going to let anything gain control over me."
1 Corinthians,6,13,"“Food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for food”? Maybe, but God will put an end to both of them. Anyhow, the body is not meant for sexual immorality but for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body."
1 Corinthians,6,14,"God raised up the Lord, and he will raise us up too by his power."
1 Corinthians,6,15,"Don’t you know that your bodies are parts of the Messiah? So, am I to take parts of the Messiah and make them parts of a prostitute? Heaven forbid!"
1 Corinthians,6,16,"Don’t you know that a man who joins himself to a prostitute becomes physically one with her? For the Tanakh says, “The two will become one flesh”"
1 Corinthians,6,17,but the person who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.
1 Corinthians,6,18,"Run from sexual immorality! Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the fornicator sins against his own body."
1 Corinthians,6,19,"Or don’t you know that your body is a temple for the Ruach HaKodesh who lives inside you, whom you received from God? The fact is, you don’t belong to yourselves"
1 Corinthians,6,20,for you were bought at a price. So use your bodies to glorify God.
1 Corinthians,7,1,Now to deal with the questions you wrote about: “Is it good for a man to keep away from women?”
1 Corinthians,7,2,"Well, because of the danger of sexual immorality, let each man have his own wife and each woman her own husband."
1 Corinthians,7,3,"The husband should give his wife what she is entitled to in the marriage relationship, and the wife should do the same for her husband."
1 Corinthians,7,4,"The wife is not in charge of her own body, but her husband is; likewise, the husband is not in charge of his own body, but his wife is."
1 Corinthians,7,5,"Do not deprive each other, except for a limited time, by mutual agreement, and then only so as to have extra time for prayer; but afterwards, come together again. Otherwise, because of your lack of self-control, you may succumb to the Adversary’s temptation."
1 Corinthians,7,6,"I am giving you this as a suggestion, not as a command."
1 Corinthians,7,7,"Actually, I wish everyone were like me; but each has his own gift from God, one this, another that."
1 Corinthians,7,8,Now to the single people and the widows I say that it is fine if they remain unmarried like me
1 Corinthians,7,9,"but if they can’t exercise self-control, they should get married; because it is better to get married than to keep burning with sexual desire."
1 Corinthians,7,10,"To those who are married I have a command, and it is not from me but from the Lord: a woman is not to separate herself from her husband"
1 Corinthians,7,11,"But if she does separate herself, she is to remain single or be reconciled with her husband. Also, a husband is not to leave his wife."
1 Corinthians,7,12,"To the rest I say — I, not the Lord: if any brother has a wife who is not a believer, and she is satisfied to go on living with him, he should not leave her."
1 Corinthians,7,13,"Also, if any woman has an unbelieving husband who is satisfied to go on living with her, she is not to leave him."
1 Corinthians,7,14,"For the unbelieving husband has been set aside for God by the wife, and the unbelieving wife has been set aside for God by the brother — otherwise your children would be “unclean,” but as it is, they are set aside for God."
1 Corinthians,7,15,"But if the unbelieving spouse separates himself, let him be separated. In circumstances like these, the brother or sister is not enslaved — God has called you to a life of peace."
1 Corinthians,7,16,"For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?"
1 Corinthians,7,17,Only let each person live the life the Lord has assigned him and live it in the condition he was in when God called him. This is the rule I lay down in all the congregations.
1 Corinthians,7,18,Was someone already circumcised when he was called? Then he should not try to remove the marks of his circumcision. Was someone uncircumcised when he was called? He shouldn’t undergo b’rit-milah.
1 Corinthians,7,19,"Being circumcised means nothing, and being uncircumcised means nothing; what does mean something is keeping God’s commandments."
1 Corinthians,7,20,Each person should remain in the condition he was in when he was called.
1 Corinthians,7,21,"Were you a slave when you were called? Well, don’t let it bother you; although if you can gain your freedom, take advantage of the opportunity."
1 Corinthians,7,22,"For a person who was a slave when he was called is the Lord’s freedman; likewise, someone who was a free man when he was called is a slave of the Messiah."
1 Corinthians,7,23,"You were bought at a price, so do not become slaves of other human beings."
1 Corinthians,7,24,"Brothers, let each one remain with God in the condition in which he was called."
1 Corinthians,7,25,"Now the question about the unmarried: I do not have a command from the Lord, but I offer an opinion as one who by the Lord’s mercy is worthy to be trusted."
1 Corinthians,7,26,I suppose that in a time of stress like the present it is good for a person to stay as he is.
1 Corinthians,7,27,"That means that if a man has a wife, he should not seek to be free of her; and if he is unmarried, he should not look for a wife."
1 Corinthians,7,28,"But if you marry you do not sin, and if a girl marries she does not sin. It is just that those who get married will have the normal problems of married life, and I would rather spare you."
1 Corinthians,7,29,"What I am saying, brothers, is that there is not much time left: from now on a man with a wife should live as if he had none "
1 Corinthians,7,30,"and those who are sad should live as if they weren’t, those who are happy as if they weren’t"
1 Corinthians,7,31,and those who deal in worldly affairs as if not engrossed in them — because the present scheme of things in this world won’t last much longer.
1 Corinthians,7,32,What I want is for you to be free of concern. An unmarried man concerns himself with the Lord’s affairs
1 Corinthians,7,33,"with how to please the Lord; but the married man concerns himself with the world’s affairs, with how to please his wife"
1 Corinthians,7,34,"and he finds himself split. Likewise the woman who is no longer married or the girl who has never been married concerns herself with the Lord’s affairs, with how to be holy both physically and spiritually; but the married woman concerns herself with the world’s affairs, with how to please her husband."
1 Corinthians,7,35,"I am telling you this for your own benefit, not to put restrictions on you — I am simply concerned that you live in a proper manner and serve the Lord with undivided devotion."
1 Corinthians,7,36,"Now if a man thinks he is behaving dishonorably by treating his fiancée this way, and if there is strong sexual desire, so that marriage is what ought to happen; then let him do what he wants — he is not sinning: let them get married."
1 Corinthians,7,37,"But if a man has firmly made up his mind, being under no compulsion but having complete control over his will, if he has decided within himself to keep his fiancée a virgin, he will be doing well."
1 Corinthians,7,38,"So the man who marries his fiancée will do well, and the man who doesn’t marry will do better."
1 Corinthians,7,39,"A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives, but if the husband dies she is free to marry anyone she wishes, provided he is a believer in the Lord."
1 Corinthians,7,40,"However, in my opinion, she will be happier if she remains unmarried, and in saying this I think I have God’s Spirit."
1 Corinthians,8,1,"Now about food sacrificed to idols: we know that, as you say, “We all have knowledge.” Yes, that is so, but “knowledge” puffs a person up with pride; whereas love builds up."
1 Corinthians,8,2,The person who thinks he “knows” something doesn’t yet know in the way he ought to know.
1 Corinthians,8,3,"However, if someone loves God, God knows him."
1 Corinthians,8,4,"So, as for eating food sacrificed to idols, we “know” that, as you say, “An idol has no real existence in the world, and there is only one God.”"
1 Corinthians,8,5,"For even if there are so-called “gods,” either in heaven or on earth — as in fact there are “gods” and “lords” galore "
1 Corinthians,8,6,"yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom all things come and for whom we exist; and one Lord, Yeshua the Messiah, through whom were created all things and through whom we have our being."
1 Corinthians,8,7,"But not everyone has this knowledge. Moreover, some people are still so accustomed to idols that when they eat food which has been sacrificed to them, they think of it as really affected by the idol; and their consciences, being weak, are thus defiled."
1 Corinthians,8,8,Now food will not improve our relationship with God — we will be neither poorer if we abstain nor richer if we eat.
1 Corinthians,8,9,However watch out that your mastery of the situation does not become a stumbling block to the weak.
1 Corinthians,8,10,"You have this “knowledge”; but suppose someone with a weak conscience sees you sitting, eating a meal in the temple of an idol. Won’t he be built up wrongly to eat this food which has been sacrificed to idols?"
1 Corinthians,8,11,"Thus by your “knowledge” this weak person is destroyed, this brother for whom the Messiah died"
1 Corinthians,8,12,"and so, when you sin against the brothers by wounding their conscience when it is weak, you are sinning against the Messiah!"
1 Corinthians,8,13,"To sum up, if food will be a snare for my brother, I will never eat meat again, lest I cause my brother to sin."
1 Corinthians,9,1,Am I not a free man? Am I not an emissary of the Messiah? Haven’t I seen Yeshua our Lord? And aren’t you yourselves the result of my work for the Lord?
1 Corinthians,9,2,"Even if to others I am not an emissary, at least I am to you; for you are living proof that I am the Lord’s emissary."
1 Corinthians,9,3,That is my defense when people put me under examination.
1 Corinthians,9,4,Don’t we have the right to be given food and drink?
1 Corinthians,9,5,"Don’t we have the right to take along with us a believing wife, as do the other emissaries, also the Lord’s brothers and Kefa?"
1 Corinthians,9,6,Or are Bar-Nabba and I the only ones required to go on working for our living?
1 Corinthians,9,7,Did you ever hear of a soldier paying his own expenses? or of a farmer planting a vineyard without eating its grapes? Who shepherds a flock without drinking some of the milk?
1 Corinthians,9,8,"What I am saying is not based merely on human authority, because the Torah says the same thing "
1 Corinthians,9,9,"for in the Torah of Moshe it is written, “You are not to put a muzzle on an ox when it is treading out the grain.” If God is concerned about cattle"
1 Corinthians,9,10,"all the more does he say this for our sakes. Yes, it was written for us, meaning that he who plows and he who threshes should work expecting to get a share of the crop."
1 Corinthians,9,11,"If we have sown spiritual seed among you, is it too much if we reap a material harvest from you?"
1 Corinthians,9,12,"If others are sharing in this right to be supported by you, don’t we have a greater claim to it?
But we don’t make use of this right. Rather, we put up with all kinds of things so as not to impede in any way the Good News about the Messiah."
1 Corinthians,9,13,"Don’t you know that those who work in the Temple get their food from the Temple, and those who serve at the altar get a share of the sacrifices offered there?"
1 Corinthians,9,14,"In the same way, the Lord directed that those who proclaim the Good News should get their living from the Good News."
1 Corinthians,9,15,"But I have not made use of any of these rights. Nor am I writing now to secure them for myself, for I would rather die than be deprived of my ground for boasting!"
1 Corinthians,9,16,For I can’t boast merely because I proclaim the Good News — this I do from inner compulsion: woe is me if I don’t proclaim the Good News!
1 Corinthians,9,17,"For if I do this willingly, I have a reward; but if I do it unwillingly, I still do it, simply because I’ve been entrusted with a job."
1 Corinthians,9,18,"So then, what is my reward? Just this: that in proclaiming the Good News I can make it available free of charge, without making use of the rights to which it entitles me."
1 Corinthians,9,19,"For although I am a free man, not bound to do anyone’s bidding, I have made myself a slave to all in order to win as many people as possible."
1 Corinthians,9,20,"That is, with Jews, what I did was put myself in the position of a Jew, in order to win Jews. With people in subjection to a legalistic perversion of the Torah, I put myself in the position of someone under such legalism, in order to win those under this legalism, even though I myself am not in subjection to a legalistic perversion of the Torah."
1 Corinthians,9,21,"With those who live outside the framework of Torah, I put myself in the position of someone outside the Torah in order to win those outside the Torah — although I myself am not outside the framework of God’s Torah but within the framework of Torah as upheld by the Messiah."
1 Corinthians,9,22,"With the “weak” I became “weak,” in order to win the “weak.” With all kinds of people I have become all kinds of things, so that in all kinds of circumstances I might save at least some of them."
1 Corinthians,9,23,"But I do it all because of the rewards promised by the Good News, so that I may share in them along with the others who come to trust."
1 Corinthians,9,24,"Don’t you know that in a race all the runners compete, but only one wins the prize? So then, run to win!"
1 Corinthians,9,25,"Now every athlete in training submits himself to strict discipline, and he does it just to win a laurel wreath that will soon wither away. But we do it to win a crown that will last forever."
1 Corinthians,9,26,"Accordingly, I don’t run aimlessly but straight for the finish line; I don’t shadow-box but try to make every punch count."
1 Corinthians,9,27,"I treat my body hard and make it my slave so that, after proclaiming the Good News to others, I myself will not be disqualified."
1 Corinthians,10,1,"For, brothers, I don’t want you to miss the significance of what happened to our fathers. All of them were guided by the pillar of cloud, and they all passed through the sea"
1 Corinthians,10,2,and in connection with the cloud and with the sea they all immersed themselves into Moshe
1 Corinthians,10,3,also they all ate the same food from the Spirit
1 Corinthians,10,4,"and they all drank the same drink from the Spirit — for they drank from a Spirit-sent Rock which followed them, and that Rock was the Messiah."
1 Corinthians,10,5,"Yet with the majority of them God was not pleased, so their bodies were strewn across the desert."
1 Corinthians,10,6,"Now these things took place as prefigurative historical events, warning us not to set our hearts on evil things as they did."
1 Corinthians,10,7,"Don’t be idolaters, as some of them were — as the Tanakh puts it, “The people sat down to eat and drink, then got up to indulge in revelry.”"
1 Corinthians,10,8,"And let us not engage in sexual immorality, as some of them did, with the consequence that 23,000 died in a single day."
1 Corinthians,10,9,"And let us not put the Messiah to the test, as some of them did, and were destroyed by snakes."
1 Corinthians,10,10,"And don’t grumble, as some of them did, and were destroyed by the Destroying Angel."
1 Corinthians,10,11,"These things happened to them as prefigurative historical events, and they were written down as a warning to us who are living in the acharit-hayamim."
1 Corinthians,10,12,"Therefore, let anyone who thinks he is standing up be careful not to fall!"
1 Corinthians,10,13,"No temptation has seized you beyond what people normally experience, and God can be trusted not to allow you to be tempted beyond what you can bear. On the contrary, along with the temptation he will also provide the way out, so that you will be able to endure."
1 Corinthians,10,14,"Therefore, my dear friends, run from idolatry!"
1 Corinthians,10,15,I speak to you as sensible people; judge for yourselves what I am saying.
1 Corinthians,10,16,"The “cup of blessing” over which we make the b’rakhah — isn’t it a sharing in the bloody sacrificial death of the Messiah? The bread we break, isn’t it a sharing in the body of the Messiah?"
1 Corinthians,10,17,"Because there is one loaf of bread, we who are many constitute one body, since we all partake of the one loaf of bread."
1 Corinthians,10,18,Look at physical Isra’el: don’t those who eat the sacrifices participate in the altar?
1 Corinthians,10,19,"So, what am I saying? That food sacrificed to idols has any significance in itself? or that an idol has significance in itself?"
1 Corinthians,10,20,"No, what I am saying is that the things which pagans sacrifice, they sacrifice not to God but to demons; and I don’t want you to become sharers of the demons!"
1 Corinthians,10,21,"You can’t drink both a cup of the Lord and a cup of demons, you can’t partake in both a meal of the Lord and a meal of demons."
1 Corinthians,10,22,"Or are we trying to make the Lord jealous? We aren’t stronger than he is, are we?"
1 Corinthians,10,23,"“Everything is permitted,” you say? Maybe, but not everything is helpful. “Everything is permitted?” Maybe, but not everything is edifying."
1 Corinthians,10,24,"No one should be looking out for his own interests, but for those of his fellow."
1 Corinthians,10,25,Eat whatever is sold in the meat market without raising questions of conscience
1 Corinthians,10,26,for the earth and everything in it belong to the Lord.
1 Corinthians,10,27,"If some unbeliever invites you to a meal, and you want to go, eat whatever is put in front of you without raising questions of conscience."
1 Corinthians,10,28,"But if someone says to you, “This meat was offered as a sacrifice,” then don’t eat it, out of consideration for the person who pointed it out and also for conscience’s sake "
1 Corinthians,10,29,"however, I don’t mean your conscience but that of the other person. You say, “Why should my freedom be determined by someone else’s conscience?"
1 Corinthians,10,30,"If I participate with thankfulness, why am I criticized over something for which I myself bless God?”"
1 Corinthians,10,31,"Well, whatever you do, whether it’s eating or drinking or anything else, do it all so as to bring glory to God."
1 Corinthians,10,32,"Do not be an obstacle to anyone — not to Jews, not to Gentiles, and not to God’s Messianic Community."
1 Corinthians,10,33,"Just as I try to please everyone in everything I do, not looking out for my own interests but for those of the many, so that they may be saved"
1 Corinthians,11,1,"try to imitate me, even as I myself try to imitate the Messiah."
1 Corinthians,11,2,Now I praise you because you have remembered everything I told you and observe the traditions just the way I passed them on to you.
1 Corinthians,11,3,"But I want you to understand that the head of every man is the Messiah, and the head of a wife is her husband, and the head of the Messiah is God."
1 Corinthians,11,4,Every man who prays or prophesies wearing something down over his head brings shame to his head
1 Corinthians,11,5,but every woman who prays or prophesies with her head unveiled brings shame to her head — there is no difference between her and a woman who has had her head shaved.
1 Corinthians,11,6,"For if a woman is not veiled, let her also have her hair cut short; but if it is shameful for a woman to wear her hair cut short or to have her head shaved, then let her be veiled."
1 Corinthians,11,7,"For a man indeed should not have his head veiled, because he is the image and glory of God, and the woman is the glory of man."
1 Corinthians,11,8,"For man was not made from woman, but woman from man"
1 Corinthians,11,9,and indeed man was not created for the sake of the woman but woman for the sake of the man.
1 Corinthians,11,10,The reason a woman should show by veiling her head that she is under authority has to do with the angels.
1 Corinthians,11,11,"Nevertheless, in union with the Lord neither is woman independent of man nor is man independent of woman"
1 Corinthians,11,12,"for as the woman was made from the man, so also the man is now born through the woman. But everything is from God."
1 Corinthians,11,13,Decide for yourselves: is it appropriate for a woman to pray to God when she is unveiled?
1 Corinthians,11,14,Doesn’t the nature of things itself teach you that a man who wears his hair long degrades himself?
1 Corinthians,11,15,"But a woman who wears her hair long enhances her appearance, because her hair has been given to her as a covering."
1 Corinthians,11,16,"However, if anyone wants to argue about it, the fact remains that we have no such custom, nor do the Messianic communities of God."
1 Corinthians,11,17,"But in giving you this next instruction I do not praise you, because when you meet together it does more harm than good!"
1 Corinthians,11,18,"For, in the first place, I hear that when you gather together as a congregation you divide up into cliques; and to a degree I believe it"
1 Corinthians,11,19,(granted that there must be some divisions among you in order to show who are the ones in the right).
1 Corinthians,11,20,"Thus, when you gather together, it is not to eat a meal of the Lord"
1 Corinthians,11,21,"because as you eat your meal, each one goes ahead on his own; so that one stays hungry while another is already drunk!"
1 Corinthians,11,22,"Don’t you have homes to eat and drink in? Or are you trying to show your contempt for God’s Messianic community and embarrass those who are poor? What am I supposed to say to you? Am I supposed to praise you? Well, for this I don’t praise you!"
1 Corinthians,11,23,"For what I received from the Lord is just what I passed on to you — that the Lord Yeshua, on the night he was betrayed, took bread"
1 Corinthians,11,24,"and after he had made the b’rakhah he broke it and said, “This is my body, which is for you. Do this as a memorial to me”"
1 Corinthians,11,25,"likewise also the cup after the meal, saying, “This cup is the New Covenant effected by my blood; do this, as often as you drink it, as a memorial to me.”"
1 Corinthians,11,26,"For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the death of the Lord, until he comes."
1 Corinthians,11,27,"Therefore, whoever eats the Lord’s bread or drinks the Lord’s cup in an unworthy manner will be guilty of desecrating the body and blood of the Lord!"
1 Corinthians,11,28,"So let a person examine himself first, and then he may eat of the bread and drink from the cup"
1 Corinthians,11,29,for a person who eats and drinks without recognizing the body eats and drinks judgment upon himself.
1 Corinthians,11,30,"This is why many among you are weak and sick, and some have died!"
1 Corinthians,11,31,"If we would examine ourselves, we would not come under judgment."
1 Corinthians,11,32,"But when we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined, so that we will not be condemned along with the world."
1 Corinthians,11,33,"So then, my brothers, when you gather together to eat, wait for one another."
1 Corinthians,11,34,"If someone is hungry, he should eat at home, so that when you meet together it will not result in judgment.
As for the other matters, I will instruct you about them when I come."
1 Corinthians,12,1,"But, brothers, I do not want you to go on being ignorant about the things of the Spirit."
1 Corinthians,12,2,"You know that when you were pagans, no matter how you felt you were being led, you were being led astray to idols, which can’t speak at all."
1 Corinthians,12,3,"Therefore, I want to make it clear to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God ever says, “Yeshua is cursed!” and no one can say, “Yeshua is Lord,” except by the Ruach HaKodesh."
1 Corinthians,12,4,"Now there are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit gives them."
1 Corinthians,12,5,"Also there are different ways of serving, but it is the same Lord being served."
1 Corinthians,12,6,"And there are different modes of working, but it is the same God working them all in everyone."
1 Corinthians,12,7,"Moreover, to each person is given the particular manifestation of the Spirit that will be for the common good."
1 Corinthians,12,8,"To one, through the Spirit, is given a word of wisdom; to another, a word of knowledge, in accordance with the same Spirit"
1 Corinthians,12,9,"to another, faith, by the same Spirit; and to another, gifts of healing, by the one Spirit"
1 Corinthians,12,10,"to another, the working of miracles; to another, prophecy; to another, the ability to judge between spirits; to another, the ability to speak in different kinds of tongues; and to yet another, the ability to interpret tongues."
1 Corinthians,12,11,"One and the same Spirit is at work in all these things, distributing to each person as he chooses."
1 Corinthians,12,12,"For just as the body is one but has many parts; and all the parts of the body, though many, constitute one body; so it is with the Messiah."
1 Corinthians,12,13,"For it was by one Spirit that we were all immersed into one body, whether Jews or Gentiles, slaves or free; and we were all given the one Spirit to drink."
1 Corinthians,12,14,For indeed the body is not one part but many.
1 Corinthians,12,15,"If the foot says, “I’m not a hand, so I’m not part of the body,” that doesn’t make it stop being part of the body."
1 Corinthians,12,16,"And if the ear says, “I’m not an eye, so I’m not part of the body,” that doesn’t make it stop being part of the body."
1 Corinthians,12,17,"If the whole body were an eye, how could it hear? If it were all hearing, how could it smell?"
1 Corinthians,12,18,"But as it is, God arranged each of the parts in the body exactly as he wanted them."
1 Corinthians,12,19,"Now if they were all just one part, where would the body be?"
1 Corinthians,12,20,"But as it is, there are indeed many parts, yet just one body."
1 Corinthians,12,21,"So the eye cannot say to the hand, “I don’t need you”; or the head to the feet, “I don’t need you.”"
1 Corinthians,12,22,"On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be less important turn out to be all the more necessary"
1 Corinthians,12,23,and upon body parts which we consider less dignified we bestow greater dignity; and the parts that aren’t attractive are the ones we make as attractive as we can
1 Corinthians,12,24,"while our attractive parts have no need for such treatment. Indeed, God has put the body together in such a way that he gives greater dignity to the parts that lack it"
1 Corinthians,12,25,"So that there will be no disagreements within the body, but rather all the parts will be equally concerned for all the others."
1 Corinthians,12,26,"Thus if one part suffers, all the parts suffer with it; and if one part is honored, all the parts share its happiness."
1 Corinthians,12,27,"Now you together constitute the body of the Messiah, and individually you are parts of it."
1 Corinthians,12,28,"And God has placed in the Messianic Community first, emissaries; second, prophets; third, teachers; then those who work miracles; then those with gifts of healing; those with ability to help; those skilled in administration; and those who speak in various tongues."
1 Corinthians,12,29,"Not all are emissaries, are they? Not all are prophets, are they? or teachers? or miracle-workers?"
1 Corinthians,12,30,"Not all have gifts of healing, not all speak in tongues, not all interpret, do they?"
1 Corinthians,12,31,"Eagerly seek the better gifts.
But now I will show you the best way of all."
1 Corinthians,13,1,"I may speak in the tongues of men, even angels;
but if I lack love, I have become merely
blaring brass or a cymbal clanging."
1 Corinthians,13,2,"I may have the gift of prophecy,
I may fathom all mysteries, know all things,
have all faith — enough to move mountains;
but if I lack love, I am nothing."
1 Corinthians,13,3,"I may give away everything that I own,
I may even hand over my body to be burned;
but if I lack love, I gain nothing."
1 Corinthians,13,4,"Love is patient and kind, not jealous, not boastful"
1 Corinthians,13,5,"not proud, rude or selfish, not easily angered,
and it keeps no record of wrongs."
1 Corinthians,13,6,"Love does not gloat over other people’s sins
but takes its delight in the truth."
1 Corinthians,13,7,"Love always bears up, always trusts,
always hopes, always endures."
1 Corinthians,13,8,"Love never ends; but prophecies will pass,
tongues will cease, knowledge will pass."
1 Corinthians,13,9,"For our knowledge is partial, and our prophecy partial"
1 Corinthians,13,10,"but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass."
1 Corinthians,13,11,"When I was a child, I spoke like a child,
thought like a child, argued like a child;
now that I have become a man,
I have finished with childish ways."
1 Corinthians,13,12,"For now we see obscurely in a mirror,
but then it will be face to face.
Now I know partly; then I will know fully,
just as God has fully known me."
1 Corinthians,13,13,"But for now, three things last —
trust, hope, love;
and the greatest of these is love."
1 Corinthians,14,1,"Pursue love!
However, keep on eagerly seeking the things of the Spirit; and especially seek to be able to prophesy."
1 Corinthians,14,2,"For someone speaking in a tongue is not speaking to people but to God, because no one can understand, since he is uttering mysteries in the power of the Spirit."
1 Corinthians,14,3,"But someone prophesying is speaking to people, edifying, encouraging and comforting them."
1 Corinthians,14,4,"A person speaking in a tongue does edify himself, but a person prophesying edifies the congregation."
1 Corinthians,14,5,"I wish you would all speak in tongues, but even more I wish you would all prophesy. The person who prophesies is greater than the person who speaks in tongues, unless someone gives an interpretation, so that the congregation can be edified."
1 Corinthians,14,6,"Brothers, suppose I come to you now speaking in tongues. How can I be of benefit to you unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching?"
1 Corinthians,14,7,"Even with lifeless musical instruments, such as a flute or a harp, how will anyone recognize the melody if one note can’t be distinguished from another?"
1 Corinthians,14,8,"And if the bugle gives an unclear sound, who will get ready for battle?"
1 Corinthians,14,9,It’s the same with you: how will anyone know what you are saying unless you use your tongue to produce intelligible speech? You will be talking to the air!
1 Corinthians,14,10,"There are undoubtedly all kinds of sounds in the world, and none is altogether meaningless"
1 Corinthians,14,11,"but if I don’t know what a person’s sounds mean, I will be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker will be a foreigner to me."
1 Corinthians,14,12,"Likewise with you: since you eagerly seek the things of the Spirit, seek especially what will help in edifying the congregation."
1 Corinthians,14,13,Therefore someone who speaks in a tongue should pray for the power to interpret.
1 Corinthians,14,14,"For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit does pray, but my mind is unproductive."
1 Corinthians,14,15,"So, what about it? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my mind."
1 Corinthians,14,16,"Otherwise, if you are giving thanks with your spirit, how will someone who has not yet received much instruction be able to say, “Amen,” when you have finished giving thanks, since he doesn’t know what you are saying?"
1 Corinthians,14,17,"For undoubtedly you are giving thanks very nicely, but the other person is not being edified."
1 Corinthians,14,18,I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you
1 Corinthians,14,19,but in a congregation meeting I would rather say five words with my mind in order to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue!
1 Corinthians,14,20,"Brothers, don’t be children in your thinking. In evil, be like infants; but in your thinking, be grown-up."
1 Corinthians,14,21,"In the Torah it is written,
“By other tongues,
by the lips of foreigners
I will speak to this people.
But even then they will not listen to me,”
says ADONAI."
1 Corinthians,14,22,"Thus tongues are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers, while prophecy is not for unbelievers but for believers."
1 Corinthians,14,23,"So if the whole congregation comes together with everybody speaking in tongues, and uninstructed people or unbelievers come in, won’t they say you’re crazy?"
1 Corinthians,14,24,"But if you all prophesy, and some unbeliever or uninstructed person enters, he is convicted of sin by all, he is brought under judgment by all"
1 Corinthians,14,25,"and the secrets of his heart are laid bare; so he falls on his face and worships God, saying, “God is really here among you!”"
1 Corinthians,14,26,"What is our conclusion, brothers? Whenever you come together, let everyone be ready with a psalm or a teaching or a revelation, or ready to use his gift of tongues or give an interpretation; but let everything be for edification."
1 Corinthians,14,27,"If the gift of tongues is exercised, let it be by two or at most three, and each in turn; and let someone interpret."
1 Corinthians,14,28,"And if there is no one present who can interpret, let the people who speak in tongues keep silent when the congregation meets — they can speak to themselves and to God."
1 Corinthians,14,29,"Let two or three prophets speak, while the others weigh what is said."
1 Corinthians,14,30,"And if something is revealed to a prophet who is sitting down, let the first one be silent."
1 Corinthians,14,31,"For you can all prophesy one by one, with the result that all will learn something and all will be encouraged."
1 Corinthians,14,32,"Also, the prophets’ spirits are under the prophets’ control"
1 Corinthians,14,33,"for God is not a God of unruliness but of shalom.
As in all the congregations of God’s people"
1 Corinthians,14,34,"let the wives remain silent when the congregation meets; they are certainly not permitted to speak out. Rather, let them remain subordinate, as also the Torah says"
1 Corinthians,14,35,"and if there is something they want to know, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is shameful for a woman to speak out in a congregational meeting."
1 Corinthians,14,36,Did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people it has reached?
1 Corinthians,14,37,"If anyone thinks he is a prophet or is endowed with the Spirit, let him acknowledge that what I am writing you is a command of the Lord."
1 Corinthians,14,38,"But if someone doesn’t recognize this, then let him remain unrecognized."
1 Corinthians,14,39,"So, my brothers, eagerly seek to prophesy; and do not forbid speaking in tongues"
1 Corinthians,14,40,but let all things be done in a proper and orderly way.
1 Corinthians,15,1,"Now, brothers, I must remind you of the Good News which I proclaimed to you, and which you received, and on which you have taken your stand"
1 Corinthians,15,2,"and by which you are being saved — provided you keep holding fast to the message I proclaimed to you. For if you don’t, your trust will have been in vain."
1 Corinthians,15,3,"For among the first things I passed on to you was what I also received, namely this: the Messiah died for our sins, in accordance with what the Tanakh says"
1 Corinthians,15,4,"and he was buried; and he was raised on the third day, in accordance with what the Tanakh says"
1 Corinthians,15,5,"and he was seen by Kefa, then by the Twelve"
1 Corinthians,15,6,"and afterwards he was seen by more than five hundred brothers at one time, the majority of whom are still alive, though some have died."
1 Corinthians,15,7,"Later he was seen by Ya‘akov, then by all the emissaries"
1 Corinthians,15,8,"and last of all he was seen by me, even though I was born at the wrong time."
1 Corinthians,15,9,"For I am the least of all the emissaries, unfit to be called an emissary, because I persecuted the Messianic Community of God."
1 Corinthians,15,10,"But by God’s grace I am what I am, and his grace towards me was not in vain; on the contrary, I have worked harder than all of them, although it was not I but the grace of God with me."
1 Corinthians,15,11,"Anyhow, whether I or they, this is what we proclaim, and this is what you believed."
1 Corinthians,15,12,"But if it has been proclaimed that the Messiah has been raised from the dead, how is it that some of you are saying there is no such thing as a resurrection of the dead?"
1 Corinthians,15,13,"If there is no resurrection of the dead, then the Messiah has not been raised"
1 Corinthians,15,14,"and if the Messiah has not been raised, then what we have proclaimed is in vain; also your trust is in vain"
1 Corinthians,15,15,"furthermore, we are shown up as false witnesses for God in having testified that God raised up the Messiah, whom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised."
1 Corinthians,15,16,"For if the dead are not raised, then the Messiah has not been raised either"
1 Corinthians,15,17,"and if the Messiah has not been raised, your trust is useless, and you are still in your sins."
1 Corinthians,15,18,"Also, if this is the case, those who died in union with the Messiah are lost."
1 Corinthians,15,19,"If it is only for this life that we have put our hope in the Messiah, we are more pitiable than anyone."
1 Corinthians,15,20,"But the fact is that the Messiah has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have died."
1 Corinthians,15,21,"For since death came through a man, also the resurrection of the dead has come through a man."
1 Corinthians,15,22,"For just as in connection with Adam all die, so in connection with the Messiah all will be made alive."
1 Corinthians,15,23,"But each in his own order: the Messiah is the firstfruits; then those who belong to the Messiah, at the time of his coming"
1 Corinthians,15,24,"then the culmination, when he hands over the Kingdom to God the Father, after having put an end to every rulership, yes, to every authority and power."
1 Corinthians,15,25,For he has to rule until he puts all his enemies under his feet.
1 Corinthians,15,26,The last enemy to be done away with will be death
1 Corinthians,15,27,"for “He put everything in subjection under his feet.” But when it says that “everything” has been subjected, obviously the word does not include God, who is himself the one subjecting everything to the Messiah."
1 Corinthians,15,28,"Now when everything has been subjected to the Son, then he will subject himself to God, who subjected everything to him; so that God may be everything in everyone."
1 Corinthians,15,29,"Were it otherwise, what would the people accomplish who are immersed on behalf of the dead? If the dead are not actually raised, why are people immersed for them?"
1 Corinthians,15,30,"For that matter, we ourselves — why do we keep facing danger hour by hour?"
1 Corinthians,15,31,"Brothers, by the right to be proud which the Messiah Yeshua our Lord gives me, I solemnly tell you that I die every day."
1 Corinthians,15,32,"If my fighting with “wild beasts” in Ephesus was done merely on a human basis, what do I gain by it? If dead people are not raised, we might as well live by the saying, “Let’s eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!”"
1 Corinthians,15,33,Don’t be fooled. “Bad company ruins good character.”
1 Corinthians,15,34,Come to your senses! Live righteously and stop sinning! There are some people who lack knowledge of God — I say this to your shame.
1 Corinthians,15,35,"But someone will ask, “In what manner are the dead raised? What sort of body do they have?”"
1 Corinthians,15,36,"Stupid! When you sow a seed, it doesn’t come alive unless it first dies."
1 Corinthians,15,37,"Also, what you sow is not the body that will be, but a bare seed of, say, wheat or something else"
1 Corinthians,15,38,but God gives it the body he intended for it; and to each kind of seed he gives its own body.
1 Corinthians,15,39,"Not all living matter is the same living matter; on the contrary, there is one kind for human beings, another kind of living matter for animals, another for birds and another for fish."
1 Corinthians,15,40,"Further, there are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies; but the beauty of heavenly bodies is one thing, while the beauty of earthly bodies is something else."
1 Corinthians,15,41,"The sun has one kind of beauty, the moon another, the stars yet another; indeed, each star has its own individual kind of beauty."
1 Corinthians,15,42,"So it is with the resurrection of the dead. When the body is “sown,” it decays; when it is raised, it cannot decay."
1 Corinthians,15,43,"When sown, it is without dignity; when raised, it will be beautiful. When sown, it is weak; when raised, it will be strong."
1 Corinthians,15,44,"When sown, it is an ordinary human body; when raised, it will be a body controlled by the Spirit. If there is an ordinary human body, there is also a body controlled by the Spirit."
1 Corinthians,15,45,"In fact, the Tanakh says so: Adam, the first man, became a living human being; but the last “Adam” has become a life-giving Spirit."
1 Corinthians,15,46,"Note, however, that the body from the Spirit did not come first, but the ordinary human one; the one from the Spirit comes afterwards."
1 Corinthians,15,47,"The first man is from the earth, made of dust; the second man is from heaven."
1 Corinthians,15,48,"People born of dust are like the man of dust, and people born from heaven are like the man from heaven"
