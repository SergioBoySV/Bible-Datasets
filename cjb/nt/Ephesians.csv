Ephesians,1,1,"From: Sha’ul, by God’s will an emissary of the Messiah Yeshua
To: God’s people living in Ephesus, that is, those who are trusting in the Messiah Yeshua"
Ephesians,1,2,Grace to you and shalom from God our Father and the Lord Yeshua the Messiah.
Ephesians,1,3,"Praised be ADONAI, Father of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah, who in the Messiah has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in heaven."
Ephesians,1,4,In the Messiah he chose us in love before the creation of the universe to be holy and without defect in his presence.
Ephesians,1,5,He determined in advance that through Yeshua the Messiah we would be his sons — in keeping with his pleasure and purpose 
Ephesians,1,6,so that we would bring him praise commensurate with the glory of the grace he gave us through the Beloved One.
Ephesians,1,7,"In union with him, through the shedding of his blood, we are set free — our sins are forgiven; this accords with the wealth of the grace"
Ephesians,1,8,he has lavished on us. In all his wisdom and insight
Ephesians,1,9,"he has made known to us his secret plan, which by his own will he designed beforehand in connection with the Messiah"
Ephesians,1,10,and will put into effect when the time is ripe — his plan to place everything in heaven and on earth under the Messiah’s headship.
Ephesians,1,11,"Also in union with him we were given an inheritance, we who were picked in advance according to the purpose of the One who effects everything in keeping with the decision of his will"
Ephesians,1,12,so that we who earlier had put our hope in the Messiah would bring him praise commensurate with his glory.
Ephesians,1,13,"Furthermore, you who heard the message of the truth, the Good News offering you deliverance, and put your trust in the Messiah were sealed by him with the promised Ruach HaKodesh"
Ephesians,1,14,who guarantees our inheritance until we come into possession of it and thus bring him praise commensurate with his glory.
Ephesians,1,15,"For this reason, ever since I heard about your trust in the Lord Yeshua and your love for all God’s people"
Ephesians,1,16,I have not stopped giving thanks for you. In my prayers I keep asking
Ephesians,1,17,"the God of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah, the glorious Father, to give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you will have full knowledge of him."
Ephesians,1,18,"I pray that he will give light to the eyes of your hearts, so that you will understand the hope to which he has called you, what rich glories there are in the inheritance he has promised his people"
Ephesians,1,19,and how surpassingly great is his power working in us who trust him. It works with the same mighty strength he used
Ephesians,1,20,when he worked in the Messiah to raise him from the dead and seat him at his right hand in heaven
Ephesians,1,21,"far above every ruler, authority, power, dominion or any other name that can be named either in the ‘olam hazeh or in the ‘olam haba."
Ephesians,1,22,"Also, he has put all things under his feet and made him head over everything for the Messianic Community"
Ephesians,1,23,"which is his body, the full expression of him who fills all creation."
Ephesians,2,1,You used to be dead because of your sins and acts of disobedience.
Ephesians,2,2,"You walked in the ways of the ‘olam hazeh and obeyed the Ruler of the Powers of the Air, who is still at work among the disobedient."
Ephesians,2,3,"Indeed, we all once lived this way — we followed the passions of our old nature and obeyed the wishes of our old nature and our own thoughts. In our natural condition we were headed for God’s wrath, just like everyone else."
Ephesians,2,4,But God is so rich in mercy and loves us with such intense love
Ephesians,2,5,"that, even when we were dead because of our acts of disobedience, he brought us to life along with the Messiah — it is by grace that you have been delivered."
Ephesians,2,6,"That is, God raised us up with the Messiah Yeshua and seated us with him in heaven"
Ephesians,2,7,"in order to exhibit in the ages to come how infinitely rich is his grace, how great is his kindness toward us who are united with the Messiah Yeshua."
Ephesians,2,8,"For you have been delivered by grace through trusting, and even this is not your accomplishment but God’s gift."
Ephesians,2,9,You were not delivered by your own actions; therefore no one should boast.
Ephesians,2,10,"For we are of God’s making, created in union with the Messiah Yeshua for a life of good actions already prepared by God for us to do."
Ephesians,2,11,"Therefore, remember your former state: you Gentiles by birth — called the Uncircumcised by those who, merely because of an operation on their flesh, are called the Circumcised "
Ephesians,2,12,at that time had no Messiah. You were estranged from the national life of Isra’el. You were foreigners to the covenants embodying God’s promise. You were in this world without hope and without God.
Ephesians,2,13,"But now, you who were once far off have been brought near through the shedding of the Messiah’s blood."
Ephesians,2,14,For he himself is our shalom — he has made us both one and has broken down the m’chitzah which divided us
Ephesians,2,15,"by destroying in his own body the enmity occasioned by the Torah, with its commands set forth in the form of ordinances. He did this in order to create in union with himself from the two groups a single new humanity and thus make shalom"
Ephesians,2,16,and in order to reconcile to God both in a single body by being executed on a stake as a criminal and thus in himself killing that enmity.
Ephesians,2,17,"Also, when he came, he announced as Good News shalom to you far off and shalom to those nearby"
Ephesians,2,18,news that through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father.
Ephesians,2,19,"So then, you are no longer foreigners and strangers. On the contrary, you are fellow-citizens with God’s people and members of God’s family."
Ephesians,2,20,"You have been built on the foundation of the emissaries and the prophets, with the cornerstone being Yeshua the Messiah himself."
Ephesians,2,21,"In union with him the whole building is held together, and it is growing into a holy temple in union with the Lord."
Ephesians,2,22,"Yes, in union with him, you yourselves are being built together into a spiritual dwelling-place for God!"
Ephesians,3,1,"It is a consequence of this that I, Sha’ul, am a prisoner of the Messiah Yeshua on behalf of you Gentiles."
Ephesians,3,2,I assume that you have heard of the work God in his grace has given me to do for your benefit
Ephesians,3,3,and that it was by a revelation that this secret plan was made known to me. I have already written about it briefly
Ephesians,3,4,"and if you read what I have written, you will grasp how I understand this secret plan concerning the Messiah."
Ephesians,3,5,"In past generations it was not made known to mankind, as the Spirit is now revealing it to his emissaries and prophets"
Ephesians,3,6,"that in union with the Messiah and through the Good News the Gentiles were to be joint heirs, a joint body and joint sharers with the Jews in what God has promised."
Ephesians,3,7,"I became a servant of this Good News by God’s gracious gift, which he gave me through the operation of his power."
Ephesians,3,8,"To me, the least important of all God’s holy people, was given this privilege of announcing to the Gentiles the Good News of the Messiah’s unfathomable riches"
Ephesians,3,9,"and of letting everyone see how this secret plan is going to work out. This plan, kept hidden for ages by God, the Creator of everything"
Ephesians,3,10,"is for the rulers and authorities in heaven to learn, through the existence of the Messianic Community, how many-sided God’s wisdom is."
Ephesians,3,11,"This accords with God’s age-old purpose, accomplished in the Messiah Yeshua, our Lord."
Ephesians,3,12,"In union with him, through his faithfulness, we have boldness and confidence when we approach God."
Ephesians,3,13,So I ask you not to be discouraged by the troubles I endure on your behalf — it is all for your glory.
Ephesians,3,14,"For this reason, I fall on my knees before the Father"
Ephesians,3,15,from whom every family in heaven and on earth receives its character.
Ephesians,3,16,I pray that from the treasures of his glory he will empower you with inner strength by his Spirit
Ephesians,3,17,so that the Messiah may live in your hearts through your trusting. Also I pray that you will be rooted and founded in love
Ephesians,3,18,"so that you, with all God’s people, will be given strength to grasp the breadth, length, height and depth of the Messiah’s love"
Ephesians,3,19,"yes, to know it, even though it is beyond all knowing, so that you will be filled with all the fullness of God."
Ephesians,3,20,Now to him who by his power working in us is able to do far beyond anything we can ask or imagine
Ephesians,3,21,to him be glory in the Messianic Community and in the Messiah Yeshua from generation to generation forever. Amen.
Ephesians,4,1,"Therefore I, the prisoner united with the Lord, beg you to lead a life worthy of the calling to which you have been called."
Ephesians,4,2,"Always be humble, gentle and patient, bearing with one another in love"
Ephesians,4,3,and making every effort to preserve the unity the Spirit gives through the binding power of shalom.
Ephesians,4,4,"There is one body and one Spirit, just as when you were called you were called to one hope."
Ephesians,4,5,"And there is one Lord, one trust, one immersion"
Ephesians,4,6,"and one God, the Father of all, who rules over all, works through all and is in all."
Ephesians,4,7,"Each one of us, however, has been given grace to be measured by the Messiah’s bounty."
Ephesians,4,8,"This is why it says,
“After he went up into the heights,
he led captivity captive
and he gave gifts to mankind.”"
Ephesians,4,9,"Now this phrase, “he went up,” what can it mean if not that he first went down into the lower parts, that is, the earth?"
Ephesians,4,10,"The one who went down is himself the one who also went up, far above all of heaven, in order to fill all things."
Ephesians,4,11,"Furthermore, he gave some people as emissaries, some as prophets, some as proclaimers of the Good News, and some as shepherds and teachers."
Ephesians,4,12,Their task is to equip God’s people for the work of service that builds the body of the Messiah
Ephesians,4,13,"until we all arrive at the unity implied by trusting and knowing the Son of God, at full manhood, at the standard of maturity set by the Messiah’s perfection."
Ephesians,4,14,"We will then no longer be infants tossed about by the waves and blown along by every wind of teaching, at the mercy of people clever in devising ways to deceive."
Ephesians,4,15,"Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in every respect grow up into him who is the head, the Messiah."
Ephesians,4,16,"Under his control, the whole body is being fitted and held together by the support of every joint, with each part working to fulfill its function; this is how the body grows and builds itself up in love."
Ephesians,4,17,"Therefore I say this — indeed, in union with the Lord I insist on it: do not live any longer as the pagans live, with their sterile ways of thinking."
Ephesians,4,18,"Their intelligence has been shrouded in darkness, and they are estranged from the life of God, because of the ignorance in them, which in turn comes from resisting God’s will."
Ephesians,4,19,"They have lost all feeling, so they have abandoned themselves to sensuality, practicing any kind of impurity and always greedy for more."
Ephesians,4,20,But this is not the lesson you learned from the Messiah!
Ephesians,4,21,"If you really listened to him and were instructed about him, then you learned that since what is in Yeshua is truth"
Ephesians,4,22,"then, so far as your former way of life is concerned, you must strip off your old nature, because your old nature is thoroughly rotted by its deceptive desires"
Ephesians,4,23,and you must let your spirits and minds keep being renewed
Ephesians,4,24,"and clothe yourselves with the new nature created to be godly, which expresses itself in the righteousness and holiness that flow from the truth."
Ephesians,4,25,"Therefore, stripping off falsehood, let everyone speak truth with his neighbor, because we are intimately related to each other as parts of a body."
Ephesians,4,26,"Be angry, but don’t sin — don’t let the sun go down before you have dealt with the cause of your anger"
Ephesians,4,27,otherwise you leave room for the Adversary.
Ephesians,4,28,"The thief must stop stealing; instead, he should make an honest living by his own efforts. This way he will be able to share with those in need."
Ephesians,4,29,"Let no harmful language come from your mouth, only good words that are helpful in meeting the need, words that will benefit those who hear them."
Ephesians,4,30,"Don’t cause grief to God’s Ruach HaKodesh, for he has stamped you as his property until the day of final redemption."
Ephesians,4,31,"Get rid of all bitterness, rage, anger, violent assertiveness and slander, along with all spitefulness."
Ephesians,4,32,"Instead, be kind to each other, tenderhearted; and forgive each other, just as in the Messiah God has also forgiven you."
Ephesians,5,1,"So imitate God, as his dear children"
Ephesians,5,2,"and live a life of love, just as also the Messiah loved us, indeed, on our behalf gave himself up as an offering, as a slaughtered sacrifice to God with a pleasing fragrance."
Ephesians,5,3,"Among you there should not even be mentioned sexual immorality, or any kind of impurity, or greed; these are utterly inappropriate for God’s holy people."
Ephesians,5,4,"Also out of place are obscenity and stupid talk or coarse language; instead, you should be giving thanks."
Ephesians,5,5,"For of this you can be sure: every sexually immoral, impure or greedy person — that is, every idol-worshipper — has no share in the Kingdom of the Messiah and of God."
Ephesians,5,6,Let no one deceive you with empty talk; for it is because of these things that God’s judgment is coming on those who disobey him.
Ephesians,5,7,So don’t become partners with them!
Ephesians,5,8,"For you used to be darkness; but now, united with the Lord, you are light. Live like children of light"
Ephesians,5,9,"for the fruit of the light is in every kind of goodness, rightness and truth "
Ephesians,5,10,try to determine what will please the Lord.
Ephesians,5,11,"Have nothing to do with the deeds produced by darkness, but instead expose them"
Ephesians,5,12,for it is shameful even to speak of the things these people do in secret.
Ephesians,5,13,But everything exposed to the light is revealed clearly for what it is
Ephesians,5,14,"since anything revealed is a light. This is why it says,
“Get up, sleeper! Arise from the dead,
and the Messiah will shine on you!”"
Ephesians,5,15,"Therefore, pay careful attention to how you conduct your life — live wisely, not unwisely."
Ephesians,5,16,"Use your time well, for these are evil days."
Ephesians,5,17,"So don’t be foolish, but try to understand what the will of the Lord is."
Ephesians,5,18,"Don’t get drunk with wine, because it makes you lose control. Instead, keep on being filled with the Spirit "
Ephesians,5,19,"sing psalms, hymns and spiritual songs to each other; sing to the Lord and make music in your heart to him"
Ephesians,5,20,always give thanks for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah.
Ephesians,5,21,Submit to one another in fear of the Messiah.
Ephesians,5,22,Wives should submit to their husbands as they do to the Lord
Ephesians,5,23,"because the husband is head of the wife, just as the Messiah, as head of the Messianic Community, is himself the one who keeps the body safe."
Ephesians,5,24,"Just as the Messianic Community submits to the Messiah, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything."
Ephesians,5,25,"As for husbands, love your wives, just as the Messiah loved the Messianic Community, indeed, gave himself up on its behalf"
Ephesians,5,26,"in order to set it apart for God, making it clean through immersion in the mikveh, so to speak"
Ephesians,5,27,"in order to present the Messianic Community to himself as a bride to be proud of, without a spot, wrinkle or any such thing, but holy and without defect."
Ephesians,5,28,This is how husbands ought to love their wives — like their own bodies; for the man who loves his wife is loving himself.
Ephesians,5,29,"Why, no one ever hated his own flesh! On the contrary, he feeds it well and takes care of it, just as the Messiah does the Messianic Community"
Ephesians,5,30,because we are parts of his Body.
Ephesians,5,31,"“Therefore a man will leave his father and mother and remain with his wife, and the two will become one.”"
Ephesians,5,32,"There is profound truth hidden here, which I say concerns the Messiah and the Messianic Community."
Ephesians,5,33,"However, the text also applies to each of you individually: let each man love his wife as he does himself, and see that the wife respects her husband."
Ephesians,6,1,"Children, what you should do in union with the Lord is obey your parents, for this is right."
Ephesians,6,2,“Honor your father and mother” — this is the first commandment that embodies a promise 
Ephesians,6,3,"“so that it may go well with you, and you may live long in the Land.”"
Ephesians,6,4,"Fathers, don’t irritate your children and make them resentful; instead, raise them with the Lord’s kind of discipline and guidance."
Ephesians,6,5,"Slaves, obey your human masters with the same fear, trembling and single-heartedness with which you obey the Messiah."
Ephesians,6,6,"Don’t obey just to win their favor, serving only when they are watching you; but serve as slaves of the Messiah, doing what God wants with all your heart."
Ephesians,6,7,"Work willingly as slaves, as people do who are serving not merely human beings but the Lord."
Ephesians,6,8,"Remember that whoever does good work, whether he be a slave or a free man, will be rewarded by the Lord."
Ephesians,6,9,"And masters, treat your slaves the same way. Don’t threaten them. Remember that in heaven both you and they have the same Master, and he has no favorites."
Ephesians,6,10,"Finally, grow powerful in union with the Lord, in union with his mighty strength!"
Ephesians,6,11,"Use all the armor and weaponry that God provides, so that you will be able to stand against the deceptive tactics of the Adversary."
Ephesians,6,12,"For we are not struggling against human beings, but against the rulers, authorities and cosmic powers governing this darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realm."
Ephesians,6,13,"So take up every piece of war equipment God provides; so that when the evil day comes, you will be able to resist; and when the battle is won, you will still be standing."
Ephesians,6,14,"Therefore, stand! Have the belt of truth buckled around your waist, put on righteousness for a breastplate"
Ephesians,6,15,and wear on your feet the readiness that comes from the Good News of shalom.
Ephesians,6,16,"Always carry the shield of trust, with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the Evil One."
Ephesians,6,17,"And take the helmet of deliverance; along with the sword given by the Spirit, that is, the Word of God"
Ephesians,6,18,"as you pray at all times, with all kinds of prayers and requests, in the Spirit, vigilantly and persistently, for all God’s people."
Ephesians,6,19,"And pray for me, too, that whenever I open my mouth, the words will be given to me to be bold in making known the secret of the Good News"
Ephesians,6,20,"for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may speak boldly, the way I should."
Ephesians,6,21,"Now, so that you may also be informed about how I am and what I am doing, Tychicus, the dear brother and a faithful worker for the Lord, will tell you everything."
Ephesians,6,22,"This is the very reason I have sent him to you, so that you may know how we are getting along and so that he may comfort and encourage you."
Ephesians,6,23,Shalom to the brothers. May God the Father and the Lord Yeshua the Messiah give you love and trust.
Ephesians,6,24,Grace be to all who love our Lord Yeshua the Messiah with undying love.
