Jeremiah,1,1,These are the words Jeremiah received from the Lord . Jeremiah was the son of Hilkiah. Jeremiah was one of the priests at Anathoth. That’s a town in the territory of Benjamin.
Jeremiah,1,2,A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah. It came in the 13th year that Josiah was king over Judah. Josiah was the son of Amon.
Jeremiah,1,3,"After Josiah, his son Jehoiakim was king over Judah. The Lord ’s message also came to Jeremiah during the whole time Jehoiakim ruled. The Lord continued to speak to Jeremiah while Zedekiah was king over Judah. He did this until the fifth month of the 11th year of Zedekiah’s rule. That’s when the people of Jerusalem were forced to leave their country. Zedekiah was the son of Josiah. Here is what Jeremiah said."
Jeremiah,1,4,"A message from the Lord came to me. The Lord said,"
Jeremiah,1,5,“Before I formed you in your mother’s body I chose you. Before you were born I set you apart to serve me. I appointed you to be a prophet to the nations.”
Jeremiah,1,6,"“You are my Lord and King,” I said. “I don’t know how to speak. I’m too young.”"
Jeremiah,1,7,"But the Lord said to me, “Do not say, ‘I’m too young.’ You must go to everyone I send you to. You must say everything I command you to say."
Jeremiah,1,8,"Do not be afraid of the people I send you to. I am with you. I will save you,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,1,9,"Then the Lord reached out his hand. He touched my mouth and spoke to me. He said, “I have put my words in your mouth."
Jeremiah,1,10,Today I am appointing you to speak to nations and kingdoms. I give you authority to pull them up by the roots and tear them down. I give you authority to destroy them and crush them. I give you authority to build them up and plant them.”
Jeremiah,1,11,"A message from the Lord came to me. The Lord asked me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?” “The branch of an almond tree,” I replied."
Jeremiah,1,12,"The Lord said to me, “You have seen correctly. I am watching to see that my word comes true.”"
Jeremiah,1,13,"Another message from the Lord came to me. The Lord asked me, “What do you see?” “A pot that has boiling water in it,” I answered. “It’s leaning toward us from the north.”"
Jeremiah,1,14,"The Lord said to me, “Something very bad will be poured out on everyone who lives in this land. It will come from the north."
Jeremiah,1,15,"I am about to send for all the armies in the northern kingdoms,” announces the Lord. “Their kings will come to Jerusalem. They will set up their thrones at the very gates of the city. They will attack all the walls that surround the city. They will go to war against all the towns of Judah."
Jeremiah,1,16,I will judge my people. They have done many evil things. They have deserted me. They have burned incense to other gods. They have worshiped the gods their own hands have made.
Jeremiah,1,17,"“So get ready! Stand up! Tell them everything I command you to. Do not let them terrify you. If you do, I will terrify you in front of them."
Jeremiah,1,18,Today I have made you like a city that has a high wall around it. I have made you like an iron pillar and a bronze wall. Now you can stand up against the whole land. You can stand against the kings and officials of Judah. You can stand against its priests and its people.
Jeremiah,1,19,"They will fight against you. But they will not win the battle over you. I am with you. I will save you,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,2,1,"A message from the Lord came to me. The Lord said,"
Jeremiah,2,2,"“Go. Announce my message to the people in Jerusalem. I want everyone to hear it. Tell them, “Here is what the Lord says. “ ‘I remember how faithful you were to me when you were young. You loved me as if you were my bride. You followed me through the desert. Nothing had been planted there."
Jeremiah,2,3,"Your people were holy to me. They were the first share of my harvest. All those who destroyed them were held guilty. And trouble came to their enemies,’ ” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,2,4,"People of Jacob, hear the Lord ’s message. Listen, all you tribes of Israel."
Jeremiah,2,5,"The Lord says, “What did your people of long ago find wrong with me? Why did they wander so far away from me? They worshiped worthless statues of gods. Then they themselves became worthless."
Jeremiah,2,6,"They did not ask, ‘Where is the Lord? He brought us up out of Egypt. He led us through a dry and empty land. He guided us through deserts and deep valleys. It was a land of total darkness where there wasn’t any rain. No one lived or traveled there.’"
Jeremiah,2,7,"But I brought you into a land that has rich soil. I gave you its fruit and its finest food. In spite of that, you made my land impure. You turned it into something I hate."
Jeremiah,2,8,"The priests did not ask, ‘Where is the Lord ?’ Those who taught my law did not know me. The leaders refused to obey me. The prophets prophesied in the name of Baal. They worshiped worthless statues of gods."
Jeremiah,2,9,"“So I am bringing charges against you again,” announces the Lord. “And I will bring charges against your children’s children."
Jeremiah,2,10,Go over to the coasts of Cyprus and look. Send people to the land of Kedar and have them look closely. See if there has ever been anything like this.
Jeremiah,2,11,"Has a nation ever changed its gods? Actually, they are not even gods at all. But my people have traded away their glorious God. They have traded me for worthless statues of gods."
Jeremiah,2,12,"Sky above, be shocked over this. Tremble with horror,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,2,13,"“My people have sinned twice. They have deserted me, even though I am the spring of water that gives life. And they have dug their own wells. But those wells are broken. They can’t hold any water."
Jeremiah,2,14,"Are you people of Israel servants? You were not born as slaves, were you? Then why have you been carried off like stolen goods?"
Jeremiah,2,15,Lions have roared. They have growled at you. They have destroyed your land. Your towns are burned and deserted.
Jeremiah,2,16,The men of Memphis and Tahpanhes have cracked your skulls.
Jeremiah,2,17,"Haven’t you brought this on yourselves? I am the Lord your God, but you deserted me. You left me even while I was leading you."
Jeremiah,2,18,Why do you go to Egypt to drink water from the Nile River? Why do you go to Assyria to drink from the Euphrates River?
Jeremiah,2,19,"You will be punished because you have sinned. You will be corrected for turning away from me. I am the Lord your God. If you desert me, bad things will happen to you. If you do not respect me, you will suffer bitterly. I want you to understand that,” announces the Lord who rules over all."
Jeremiah,2,20,"“Long ago you broke off the yoke I put on you. You tore off the ropes I tied you up with. You said, ‘I won’t serve you!’ In fact, on every high hill you lay down like a prostitute. You worshiped other gods under every green tree."
Jeremiah,2,21,"You were like a good vine when I planted you. You were a healthy plant. Then how did you turn against me? How did you become a bad, wild vine?"
Jeremiah,2,22,"You might wash yourself with soap. You might use plenty of strong soap. But I can still see the stains your guilt covers you with,” announces the Lord and King."
Jeremiah,2,23,"“You say, ‘I am “clean.” I haven’t followed the gods that are named Baal.’ How can you say that? Remember how you acted in the valley. Consider what you have done. You are like a female camel running quickly here and there."
Jeremiah,2,24,You are like a wild donkey that lives in the desert. She smells the wind when she longs for a mate. Who can hold her back? The males that run after her do not need to wear themselves out. At mating time they will easily find her.
Jeremiah,2,25,"Do not run after other gods until your sandals are worn out and your throat is dry. But you said, ‘It’s no use! I love those gods. I must go after them.’"
Jeremiah,2,26,“A thief is dishonored when he is caught. And you people of Israel are filled with shame. Your kings and officials are dishonored. So are your priests and your prophets.
Jeremiah,2,27,"You say to a piece of wood, ‘You are my father.’ You say to a stone, ‘You are my mother.’ You have turned your backs to me. You refuse to look at me. But when you are in trouble, you say, ‘Come and save us!’"
Jeremiah,2,28,"Then where are the gods you made for yourselves? Let them come when you are in trouble! Let them save you if they can! Judah, you have as many gods as you have towns."
Jeremiah,2,29,"“Why do you bring charges against me? All of you have refused to obey me,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,2,30,“I punished your people. But it did not do them any good. They did not pay attention when they were corrected. You have killed your prophets by swords. You have swallowed them up like a hungry lion.
Jeremiah,2,31,"“You who are now living, consider my message. I am saying, “Have I been like a desert to Israel? Have I been like a land of deep darkness? Why do my people say, ‘We are free to wander. We won’t come to you anymore’?"
Jeremiah,2,32,Does a young woman forget all about her jewelry? Does a bride forget her wedding jewels? But my people have forgotten me more days than anyone can count.
Jeremiah,2,33,You are very skilled at chasing after love! Even the worst of women can learn from how you act.
Jeremiah,2,34,"The blood of those you have killed is on your clothes. You have destroyed poor people who were not guilty. You did not catch them in the act of breaking in. In spite of all this,"
Jeremiah,2,35,"you say, ‘I’m not guilty of doing anything wrong. The Lord isn’t angry with me.’ But I will judge you. That’s because you say, ‘I haven’t sinned.’"
Jeremiah,2,36,Why do you keep on changing your ways so much? Assyria did not help you. And Egypt will not help you either.
Jeremiah,2,37,So you will also leave Egypt with your hands tied together above your heads. I have turned my back on those you trust. They will not help you.
Jeremiah,3,1,"“Suppose a man divorces his wife. What if she then marries another man? Should her first husband return to her again? If he does, won’t the land become completely ‘unclean’? People of Israel, you have lived like a prostitute. You have loved many other gods. So do you think you can return to me now?” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,3,2,“Look up at the bare hilltops. Is there any place where you have not worshiped other gods? You have been unfaithful to me like a wife committing adultery. By the side of the road you sat waiting for lovers. You sat there like someone who wanders in the desert. You have made the land impure. You are like a sinful prostitute.
Jeremiah,3,3,So I have held back the showers. I have kept the spring rains from falling. But you still have the bold face of a prostitute. You refuse to blush with shame.
Jeremiah,3,4,"You have just now called out to me. You said, ‘My Father, you have been my friend ever since I was young."
Jeremiah,3,5,Will you always be angry with me? Will your anger continue forever?’ This is how you talk. But you do all the evil things you can.”
Jeremiah,3,6,"During the time Josiah was king, the Lord spoke to me. He said, “Have you seen what the people of Israel have done? They have not been faithful to me. They have committed adultery with other gods. They worshiped them on every high hill and under every green tree."
Jeremiah,3,7,"I thought that after they had done all this, they would return to me. But they did not. Their sister nation Judah saw them doing this. And they were not faithful to me either."
Jeremiah,3,8,I gave Israel their letter of divorce. I sent them away because they were unfaithful to me so many times. But I saw that their sister nation Judah did not have any respect for me. They were not faithful to me either. They also went out and committed adultery with other gods.
Jeremiah,3,9,"Israel was not faithful to me, but that did not bother them at all. They made the land ‘unclean.’ They worshiped gods that were made out of stone and wood."
Jeremiah,3,10,"In spite of all this, their sister nation Judah did not come back to me. They were not faithful to me either. They did not return with all their heart. They only pretended to,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,3,11,"The Lord said to me, “Israel and Judah have not been faithful to me. But Israel was not as bad as Judah was."
Jeremiah,3,12,"Go. Announce this message to the people in the north. Tell them, “ ‘Israel, you have not been faithful,’ announces the Lord. ‘Return to me. Then I will do good things for you again. That’s because I am faithful,’ announces the Lord. ‘I will not be angry with you forever."
Jeremiah,3,13,"Admit that you are guilty of doing what is wrong. You have refused to obey me. I am the Lord your God. You have committed adultery with other gods. You worshiped them under every green tree. And you have not obeyed me,’ ” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,3,14,"“You people have not been faithful,” announces the Lord . “Return to me. I am your husband. I will choose one of you from each town. I will choose two from each territory. And I will bring you to the city of Zion."
Jeremiah,3,15,Then I will give you shepherds who are dear to my heart. Their knowledge and understanding will help them lead you.
Jeremiah,3,16,"In those days there will be many more of you in the land,” announces the Lord . “Then people will not talk about the ark of the covenant of the Lord anymore. It will never enter their minds. They will not remember it. The ark will not be missed. And another one will not be made."
Jeremiah,3,17,At that time they will call Jerusalem The Throne of the Lord . All the nations will gather together there. They will go there to honor me. They will no longer do what their stubborn and evil hearts want them to do.
Jeremiah,3,18,In those days the people of Judah will join the people of Israel. Together they will come from a land in the north. They will come to the land I gave to your people of long ago. I wanted them to have it as their very own.
Jeremiah,3,19,"“I myself said, “ ‘I would gladly treat you like my children. I would give you a pleasant land. It is the most beautiful land any nation could have.’ I thought you would call me ‘Father.’ I hoped you would always obey me."
Jeremiah,3,20,"But you people are like a woman who is not faithful to her husband. Israel, you have not been faithful to me,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,3,21,A cry is heard on the bare hilltops. The people of Israel are weeping and begging for help. That’s because their lives are so twisted. They’ve forgotten the Lord their God.
Jeremiah,3,22,"“You have not been faithful,” says the Lord. “Return to me. I will heal you. Then you will not turn away from me anymore.” “Yes,” the people say. “We will come to you. You are the Lord our God."
Jeremiah,3,23,The gods we worship on the hills and mountains are useless. You are the Lord our God. You are the only one who can save us.
Jeremiah,3,24,From our earliest years shameful gods have harmed us. They have eaten up everything our people of long ago worked for. They have eaten up our flocks and herds. They’ve destroyed our sons and daughters.
Jeremiah,3,25,Let us lie down in our shame. Let our dishonor cover us. You are the Lord our God. But we have sinned against you. We and our people of long ago have sinned. We haven’t obeyed you from our earliest years until now.”
Jeremiah,4,1,"“If you, Israel, will return,” announces the Lord, “then return to me. Put the statues of your gods out of my sight. I hate them. Stop going astray."
Jeremiah,4,2,"Make all your promises in my name. When you promise say, ‘You can be sure that the Lord is alive.’ Be truthful, fair and honest when you make these promises. Then the nations will ask for blessings from me. And they will boast about me.”"
Jeremiah,4,3,"Here is what the Lord is telling the people of Judah and Jerusalem. He says, “Your hearts are as hard as a field that has not been plowed. So change your ways and produce good crops. Do not plant seeds among thorns."
Jeremiah,4,4,"People of Judah and you who live in Jerusalem, obey me. Do not let your hearts be stubborn. If you do, my anger will blaze out against you. It will burn like fire because of the evil things you have done. No one will be able to put it out."
Jeremiah,4,5,"“Announce my message in Judah. Tell it in Jerusalem. Say, ‘Blow trumpets all through the land!’ Give a loud shout and say, ‘Gather together! Let’s run to cities that have high walls around them!’"
Jeremiah,4,6,Warn everyone to go to Zion! Run for safety! Do not wait! I am bringing trouble from the north. Everything will be totally destroyed.”
Jeremiah,4,7,Lions have come out of their dens. Those who destroy nations have begun to march out. They have left their place to destroy your land completely. Your towns will be broken to pieces. No one will live in them.
Jeremiah,4,8,So put on the clothes of sadness. Mourn and weep over what has happened. The Lord hasn’t turned his great anger away from us.
Jeremiah,4,9,"“A dark day is coming,” announces the Lord. “The king and his officials will lose hope. The priests will be shocked. And the prophets will be terrified.”"
Jeremiah,4,10,"Then I said, “You are my Lord and King. You have completely tricked the people of Judah and Jerusalem! You have told them, ‘You will have peace and rest.’ But swords are pointed at our throats!”"
Jeremiah,4,11,"At that time the people of Judah and Jerusalem will be warned. They will be told, “A hot and dry wind is coming, my people. It is blowing toward you from the bare hilltops in the desert. But it does not separate straw from grain."
Jeremiah,4,12,It is much too strong for that. The wind is coming from me. I am making my decision against you.”
Jeremiah,4,13,Look! Our enemies are approaching like the clouds. Their chariots are coming like a strong wind. Their horses are faster than eagles. How terrible it will be for us! We’ll be destroyed!
Jeremiah,4,14,"People of Jerusalem, wash your sins from your hearts and be saved. How long will you hold on to your evil thoughts?"
Jeremiah,4,15,A voice is speaking all the way from the city of Dan. From the hills of Ephraim it announces that trouble is coming.
Jeremiah,4,16,"“Tell the nations. Make an announcement concerning Jerusalem. Say, ‘An army will attack Judah. It is coming from a land far away. It will shout a war cry against the cities of Judah."
Jeremiah,4,17,"It will surround them like people who guard a field. Judah has refused to obey me,’ ” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,4,18,“The army will attack you because of your conduct and actions. This is how you will be punished. It will be so bitter! It will cut deep down into your hearts!”
Jeremiah,4,19,I’m suffering! I’m really suffering! I’m hurting badly. My heart is suffering so much! It’s pounding inside me. I can’t keep silent. I’ve heard the sound of trumpets. I’ve heard the battle cry.
Jeremiah,4,20,One trouble follows another. The whole land is destroyed. In an instant my tents are gone. My home disappears in a moment.
Jeremiah,4,21,How long must I look at our enemy’s battle flag? How long must I hear the sound of the trumpets?
Jeremiah,4,22,"The Lord says, “My people are foolish. They do not know me. They are children who do not have any sense. They have no understanding at all. They are skilled in doing what is evil. They do not know how to do what is good.”"
Jeremiah,4,23,I looked at the earth. It didn’t have any shape. And it was empty. I looked at the sky. Its light was gone.
Jeremiah,4,24,I looked at the mountains. They were shaking. All the hills were swaying.
Jeremiah,4,25,I looked. And there weren’t any people. Every bird in the sky had flown away.
Jeremiah,4,26,I looked. And the fruitful land had become a desert. All its towns were destroyed. The Lord had done all this because of his great anger.
Jeremiah,4,27,"The Lord says, “The whole land will be destroyed. But I will not destroy it completely."
Jeremiah,4,28,"So the earth will be filled with sadness. The sky above will grow dark. I have spoken, and I will not take pity on them. I have made my decision, and I will not change my mind.”"
Jeremiah,4,29,People can hear the sound of horsemen. Men armed with bows are coming. The people in every town run away. Some of them go into the bushes. Others climb up among the rocks. All the towns are deserted. No one is living in them.
Jeremiah,4,30,"What are you doing, you who are destroyed? Why do you dress yourself in bright red clothes? Why do you put on jewels of gold? Why do you put makeup on your eyes? You make yourself beautiful for no reason at all. Your lovers hate you. They want to kill you."
Jeremiah,4,31,"I hear a cry like the cry of a woman having a baby. I hear a groan like someone having her first child. It’s the cry of the people of Zion struggling to breathe. They reach out their hands and say, “Help us! We’re fainting! Murderers are about to kill us!”"
Jeremiah,5,1,"The Lord says, “Go up and down the streets of Jerusalem. Look around. Think about what you see. Search through the market. See if you can find one honest person who tries to be truthful. If you can, I will forgive this city."
Jeremiah,5,2,"They make their promises in my name. They say, ‘You can be sure that the Lord is alive.’ But their promises can’t be trusted.”"
Jeremiah,5,3," Lord , don’t your eyes look for truth? You struck down your people. But they didn’t feel any pain. You crushed them. But they refused to be corrected. They made their faces harder than stone. They refused to turn away from their sins."
Jeremiah,5,4,"I thought, “The people of Jerusalem are foolish. They don’t know how the Lord wants them to live. They don’t know what their God requires of them."
Jeremiah,5,5,So I will go to the leaders. I’ll speak to them. They should know how the Lord wants them to live. They must know what their God requires of them.” But all of them had broken off the yoke the Lord had put on them. They had torn off the ropes he had tied them up with.
Jeremiah,5,6,So a lion from the forest will attack them. A wolf from the desert will destroy them. A leopard will hide and wait near their towns. It will tear to pieces anyone who dares to go out. Again and again they have refused to obey the Lord. They have turned away from him many times.
Jeremiah,5,7,"The Lord says, “Jerusalem, why should I forgive you? Your people have deserted me. They have made their promises in the names of gods that are not really gods at all. I supplied everything they needed. But they committed adultery. Large crowds went to the houses of prostitutes."
Jeremiah,5,8,Your people are like stallions that have plenty to eat. Their sinful desires are out of control. Each of them goes after another man’s wife.
Jeremiah,5,9,Shouldn’t I punish them for this?” announces the Lord. “Shouldn’t I pay back the nation that does these things?
Jeremiah,5,10,"“Armies of Babylon, go through their vineyards and destroy them. But do not destroy them completely. Strip off their branches. These people do not belong to me."
Jeremiah,5,11,"The people of Israel and the people of Judah have not been faithful to me at all,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,5,12,"They have told lies about the Lord. They said, “He won’t do anything! No harm will come to us. We will never see war or be hungry."
Jeremiah,5,13,The prophets are nothing but wind. Their message doesn’t come from the Lord. So let what they say will happen be done to them.”
Jeremiah,5,14,"The Lord God rules over all. He says to me, “The people have spoken these words. So my words will be like fire in your mouth. I will make the people like wood. And the fire will burn them up.”"
Jeremiah,5,15,"“People of Israel, listen to me,” announces the Lord. “I am bringing against you a nation from far away. It is an old nation. And it will last for a long time. Its people speak a language you do not know. You can’t understand what they are saying."
Jeremiah,5,16,The bags they carry their arrows in are like an open grave. All their soldiers are mighty.
Jeremiah,5,17,They will eat up your crops and your food. They will strike down your sons and daughters. They will kill your sheep and cattle. They will destroy your vines and fig trees. You trust in your cities that have high walls around them. But the people in them will be killed by swords.
Jeremiah,5,18,"“In spite of that, even in those days I will not destroy you completely,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,5,19,"“ ‘Jeremiah,’ the people will ask, ‘Why has the Lord our God done all this to us?’ Then you will tell them, ‘You have deserted the Lord . You have served other gods in your own land. So now you will serve another nation in a land that is not your own.’"
Jeremiah,5,20,"“Here is what I want you to announce to the people of Jacob. Tell it in Judah. Tell them I say,"
Jeremiah,5,21,"‘Listen to this, you foolish people, who do not have any sense. You have eyes, but you do not see. You have ears, but you do not hear."
Jeremiah,5,22,"Shouldn’t you have respect for me?’ announces the Lord. ‘Shouldn’t you tremble with fear in front of me? I made the sand to hold the ocean back. It will do that forever. The ocean can’t go past it. The waves might roll, but they can’t sweep over it. They might roar, but they can’t go across it."
Jeremiah,5,23,But you people have stubborn hearts. You refuse to obey me. You have turned away from me. You have gone astray.
Jeremiah,5,24,"You do not say to yourselves, “Let us have respect for the Lord our God. He sends rain in the fall and the spring. He promises us that the harvest will come at the same time each year.”"
Jeremiah,5,25,But the things you have done wrong have robbed you of these gifts. Your sins have kept these good things far away from you.’
Jeremiah,5,26,"“Jeremiah, some of my people are evil. They hide and wait just as people hide to catch birds. They set traps for people."
Jeremiah,5,27,A hunter uses tricks to fill his cage with birds. And my people have filled their houses with a lot of goods. They have become rich and powerful.
Jeremiah,5,28,They have grown fat and heavy. There is no limit to the evil things they do. In court they do not seek justice. They don’t protect the rights of children whose fathers have died. They do not stand up for poor people.
Jeremiah,5,29,Shouldn’t I punish them for this?” announces the Lord. “Shouldn’t I pay back the nation that does these things?
Jeremiah,5,30,“Something horrible and shocking has happened in the land.
Jeremiah,5,31,The prophets prophesy lies. The priests rule by their own authority. And my people love it this way. But what will you do in the end?”
Jeremiah,6,1,"The Lord says, “People of Benjamin, run for safety! Run away from Jerusalem! Blow trumpets in the city of Tekoa! Warn everyone in Beth Hakkerem! Horrible trouble is coming from the north. The Babylonians will destroy everything with awful power."
Jeremiah,6,2,"I will destroy the city of Zion, even though it is very beautiful."
Jeremiah,6,3,Shepherds will come against it with their flocks. They will set up their tents around it. All of them will take care of their own sheep.”
Jeremiah,6,4,"The Babylonians say, “Prepare for battle against Judah! Get up! Let’s attack them at noon! But the daylight is fading. The shadows of evening are getting longer."
Jeremiah,6,5,So get up! Let’s attack them at night! Let’s destroy their strongest forts!”
Jeremiah,6,6,"The Lord who rules over all speaks to the Babylonians. He says, “Cut down some trees. Use the wood to build ramps against Jerusalem’s walls. I must punish that city. It is filled with people who treat others badly."
Jeremiah,6,7,"Wells keep giving fresh water. And Jerusalem keeps on sinning. Its people are always fighting and causing trouble. When I look at them, I see nothing but sickness and wounds."
Jeremiah,6,8,"Jerusalem, listen to my warning. If you do not, I will turn away from you. Your land will become a desert. No one will be able to live there.”"
Jeremiah,6,9,"The Lord rules over all. He says to me, “People gather the few grapes left on a vine. So let Israel’s enemies gather the few people left alive in the land Look carefully at the branches again. Do this like someone who gathers the last few grapes.”"
Jeremiah,6,10,Who can I speak to? Who can I warn? Who will even listen to me? Their ears are closed so they can’t hear. The Lord ’s message displeases them. They don’t take any delight in it.
Jeremiah,6,11,"But the Lord ’s anger burns inside me. I can no longer hold it in. The Lord says to me, “Pour out my anger on the children in the street. Pour it out on the young men who are gathered together. Husband and wife alike will be caught in it. So will those who are very old."
Jeremiah,6,12,"I will reach out my hand against those who live in the land,” announces the Lord. “Then their houses will be turned over to others. So will their fields and their wives."
Jeremiah,6,13,"Everyone wants to get richer and richer, from the least important of them to the most important. Prophets and priests alike try to fool everyone they can."
Jeremiah,6,14,"They bandage the wounds of my people as if they were not very deep. ‘Peace, peace,’ they say. But there isn’t any peace."
Jeremiah,6,15,"Are they ashamed of their hateful actions? No. They do not feel any shame at all. They do not even know how to blush. So they will fall like others who have already fallen. They will be brought down when I punish them,” says the Lord."
Jeremiah,6,16,"The Lord tells the people of Judah, “Stand where the roads cross, and look around. Ask where the old paths are. Ask for the good path, and walk on it. Then your hearts will find rest in me. But you said, ‘We won’t walk on it.’"
Jeremiah,6,17,"I appointed prophets to warn you. I said, ‘Listen to the sound of the trumpets!’ But you said, ‘We won’t listen.’"
Jeremiah,6,18,"So pay attention, you nations. You are witnesses for me. Watch what will happen to my people."
Jeremiah,6,19,"Earth, pay attention. I am going to bring trouble on them. I will punish them because of the evil things they have done. They have not listened to my words. They have said no to my law."
Jeremiah,6,20,What do I care about incense from the land of Sheba? Why should I bother with sweet-smelling cane from a land far away? I do not accept your burnt offerings. Your sacrifices do not please me.”
Jeremiah,6,21,"So the Lord says, “I will bring an army against the people of Judah. Parents and children alike will trip and fall. Neighbors and friends will die.”"
Jeremiah,6,22,"The Lord says to Jerusalem, “Look! An army is coming from the land of the north. I am stirring up a great nation. Its army is coming from a land that is very far away."
Jeremiah,6,23,"Its soldiers are armed with bows and spears. They are mean. They do not show any mercy at all. They come riding in on their horses. They sound like the roaring ocean. They are lined up for battle. They are marching out to attack you, city of Zion.”"
Jeremiah,6,24,We have heard reports about them. And our hands can’t help us. We are suffering greatly. It’s like the pain of a woman having a baby.
Jeremiah,6,25,Don’t go out to the fields. Don’t walk on the roads. Our enemies have swords. And there is terror on every side.
Jeremiah,6,26,"My people, put on the clothes of sadness. Roll among the ashes. Mourn with bitter weeping just as you would mourn for an only son. The one who is going to destroy us will come suddenly."
Jeremiah,6,27,"The Lord says to me, “I have made you like one who tests metals. My people are the ore. I want you to watch them and test the way they live."
Jeremiah,6,28,All of them are used to disobeying me. They go around telling lies about others. They are like bronze mixed with iron. All of them do very sinful things.
Jeremiah,6,29,The fire is made very hot so the lead will burn away. But it is impossible to make these people pure. Those who are evil are not removed.
Jeremiah,6,30,They are like silver that is thrown away. That is because I have not accepted them.”
Jeremiah,7,1,"A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah. The Lord said,"
Jeremiah,7,2,"“Stand at the gate of my house. Announce my message to the people there. Say, “ ‘Listen to the Lord ’s message, all you people of Judah. You always come through these gates to worship the Lord."
Jeremiah,7,3,"The God of Israel is speaking to you. He is the Lord who rules over all. He says, “Change the way you live and act. Then I will let you live in this place."
Jeremiah,7,4,"Do not trust in lies. Do not say, ‘This is the temple of the Lord ! This is the temple of the Lord ! This is the temple of the Lord !’"
Jeremiah,7,5,You must really change the way you live and act. Treat one another fairly.
Jeremiah,7,6,Do not treat outsiders or widows badly in this place. Do not take advantage of children whose fathers have died. Do not kill those who are not guilty of doing anything wrong. Do not worship other gods. That will only bring harm to you.
Jeremiah,7,7,"If you obey me, I will let you live in this place. It is the land I gave your people of long ago. It was promised to them for ever and ever."
Jeremiah,7,8,But look! You are trusting in worthless lies.
Jeremiah,7,9,“ ‘ “You continue to steal and commit murder. You commit adultery. You tell lies in court. You burn incense to Baal. You worship other gods you didn’t know before.
Jeremiah,7,10,"Then you come and stand in front of me. You keep coming to this house where I have put my Name. You say, ‘We are safe.’ You think you are safe when you do so many things I hate."
Jeremiah,7,11,My Name is in this house. But you have made it a den for robbers! I have been watching you!” announces the Lord.
Jeremiah,7,12,“ ‘ “Go now to the town of Shiloh. Go to the place where I first made a home for my Name. See what I did to it because of the evil things my people Israel were doing.
Jeremiah,7,13,"I spoke to you again and again,” announces the Lord . “I warned you while you were doing all these things. But you did not listen. I called out to you. But you did not answer."
Jeremiah,7,14,So what I did to Shiloh I will now do to the house where my Name is. It is the temple you trust in. It is the place I gave to you and your people of long ago.
Jeremiah,7,15,But I will throw you out of my land. That is exactly what I did to the people of Ephraim. And they are your relatives.” ’
Jeremiah,7,16,"“Jeremiah, do not pray for these people. Do not make any appeal or request for them. Do not beg me. I will not listen to you."
Jeremiah,7,17,Don’t you see what they are doing? They are worshiping other gods in the towns of Judah. They are offering sacrifices to them in the streets of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah,7,18,The children go out and gather wood. The fathers light the fire. The women mix the dough. They make flat cakes of bread to offer to the female god called the Queen of Heaven. They pour out drink offerings to other gods. That makes me very angry.
Jeremiah,7,19,But am I the one they are hurting?” announces the Lord . “Aren’t they only harming themselves? They should be ashamed of it.”
Jeremiah,7,20,"So the Lord and King says, “I will pour out my burning anger on this place. It will strike people and animals alike. It will destroy the trees in the fields and the crops in your land. It will burn, and no one will be able to put it out.”"
Jeremiah,7,21,"The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel. He says, “Go ahead! Add your burnt offerings to your other sacrifices. Eat the meat yourselves!"
Jeremiah,7,22,"When I brought your people out of Egypt, I spoke to them. But I did not just give them commands about burnt offerings and sacrifices."
Jeremiah,7,23,"I also gave them another command. I said, ‘Obey me. Then I will be your God. And you will be my people. Live the way I command you to live. Then things will go well with you.’"
Jeremiah,7,24,"But they did not listen. They refused to pay any attention to me. Instead, they did what their stubborn and evil hearts wanted them to do. They went backward and not forward."
Jeremiah,7,25,Again and again I sent my servants the prophets to you. They came to you day after day. They prophesied from the time your people left Egypt until now.
Jeremiah,7,26,But your people of long ago did not listen. They refused to pay any attention to me. They were stubborn. They did more evil things than their people who lived before them.
Jeremiah,7,27,"“Jeremiah, when you tell them all this, they will not listen to you. When you call out to them, they will not answer."
Jeremiah,7,28,"So say to them, ‘You are a nation that has not obeyed the Lord your God. You did not pay attention when you were corrected. Truth has died out. You do not tell the truth anymore.’ ”"
Jeremiah,7,29,"The Lord says to the people of Jerusalem, “Cut off your hair. Throw it away. Sing a song of sadness on the bare hilltops. I am very angry with you. I have turned my back on you. I have deserted you."
Jeremiah,7,30,"“The people of Judah have done what is evil in my eyes,” announces the Lord . “They have set up statues of their gods. They have worshiped them in the house where my Name is. They have made my house ‘unclean.’ I hate those statues."
Jeremiah,7,31,The people have built the high places of Topheth in the Valley of Ben Hinnom. There they worship other gods. And there they sacrifice their children in the fire. That is something I did not command. It did not even enter my mind.
Jeremiah,7,32,"So watch out!” announces the Lord . “The days are coming when people will not call it Topheth anymore. And they will not call it the Valley of Ben Hinnom either. Instead, they will call it the Valley of Death. They will bury the dead bodies of some people in Topheth. But they will run out of room."
Jeremiah,7,33,Then they will not be able to bury the bodies of other people there. So the bodies will become food for birds and wild animals. And no one will scare them away.
Jeremiah,7,34,I will put an end to the sounds of joy and gladness. The voices of brides and grooms will not be heard anymore. There will be no sounds of joy in the towns of Judah. And there will be no joy in the streets of Jerusalem. The land will become a desert.
Jeremiah,8,1,"“At that time the tombs will be opened,” announces the Lord . “The bones of the kings and officials of Judah will be brought out. The bones of the priests and prophets will be removed. So will the bones of the people of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,8,2,"They will lie outside under the sun, moon and all the stars. All these people had loved and served these things. They had followed them and worshiped them. They had asked them for advice. So the bones of these people will not be gathered up or buried again. Instead, they will be like human waste lying there on the ground."
Jeremiah,8,3,Everyone left alive in this evil nation will want to die rather than live. That is what they will long for in the lands where I force them to go.” The Lord who rules over all announces this.
Jeremiah,8,4,"“Jeremiah, tell them, ‘The Lord says, “ ‘ “When people fall down, don’t they get up again? When someone turns away, don’t they come back?"
Jeremiah,8,5,Then why have the people of Jerusalem turned away from me? Why do they always turn away? They keep on telling lies. They refuse to come back to me.
Jeremiah,8,6,"I have listened carefully. But they do not say what is right. They refuse to turn away from their sins. None of them says, ‘What have I done?’ Each of them goes their own way. They are like horses charging into battle."
Jeremiah,8,7,"Storks know when to fly south. So do doves, swifts and thrushes. But my people do not know what I require them to do."
Jeremiah,8,8,"“ ‘ “How can you people say, ‘We are wise. We have the law of the Lord ’? Actually, the teachers of the law have told lies about it. Their pens have not written what is true."
Jeremiah,8,9,Those who think they are wise will be put to shame. They will become terrified. They will be trapped. They have not accepted my message. So what kind of wisdom do they have?
Jeremiah,8,10,"I will give their wives to other men. I will give their fields to new owners. Everyone wants to get richer and richer. Everyone is greedy, from the least important to the most important. Prophets and priests alike try to fool everyone they can."
Jeremiah,8,11,"They bandage the wounds of my people as if they were not very deep. ‘Peace, peace,’ they say. But there isn’t any peace."
Jeremiah,8,12,"Are they ashamed of their hateful actions? No. They do not feel any shame at all. They do not even know how to blush. So they will fall like others who have already fallen. They will be brought down when I punish them,” says the Lord."
Jeremiah,8,13,"“ ‘ “I will take away their harvest,” announces the Lord. “There will not be any grapes on the vines. The trees will not bear any figs. The leaves on the trees will dry up. What I have given my people will be taken away from them.” ’ ”"
Jeremiah,8,14,Why are we sitting here? Let’s gather together! Let’s run to the cities that have high walls around them! Let’s die there! The Lord our God has sentenced us to death. He has given us poisoned water to drink. That’s because we’ve sinned against him.
Jeremiah,8,15,We hoped peace would come. But nothing good has happened to us. We hoped we would finally be healed. But there is only terror.
Jeremiah,8,16,"When our enemy’s horses snort, the noise is heard all the way from the city of Dan. When their stallions neigh, the whole land trembles with fear. They have come to destroy the land and everything in it. The city and everyone who lives there will be destroyed."
Jeremiah,8,17,"“People of Judah, I will send poisonous snakes among you. No one will be able to charm them. And they will bite you,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,8,18," Lord , my heart is weak inside me. You comfort me when I’m sad."
Jeremiah,8,19,"Listen to the cries of my people from a land far away. They cry out, “Isn’t the Lord in Zion? Isn’t its King there anymore?” The Lord says, “Why have they made me so angry by worshiping their wooden gods? Why have they made me angry with their worthless statues of gods from other lands?”"
Jeremiah,8,20,"The people say, “The harvest is over. The summer has ended. And we still haven’t been saved.”"
Jeremiah,8,21,"My people are crushed, so I am crushed. I mourn, and I am filled with horror."
Jeremiah,8,22,Isn’t there any healing lotion in Gilead? Isn’t there a doctor there? Then why doesn’t someone heal the wounds of my people?
Jeremiah,9,1,I wish my head were a spring of water! I wish my eyes were a fountain of tears! I would weep day and night for my people who have been killed.
Jeremiah,9,2,I wish I had somewhere to go in the desert where a traveler could stay! Then I could leave my people. I could get away from them. All of them commit adultery by worshiping other gods. They aren’t faithful to the Lord.
Jeremiah,9,3,"“They get ready to use their tongues like bows,” announces the Lord. “Their mouths shoot out lies like arrows. They tell lies to gain power in the land. They go from one sin to another. They do not pay any attention to me."
Jeremiah,9,4,Be on guard against your friends. Do not trust the members of your own family. Every one of them cheats. Every friend tells lies.
Jeremiah,9,5,One friend cheats another. No one tells the truth. They have taught their tongues how to lie. They wear themselves out sinning.
Jeremiah,9,6,"Jeremiah, you live among people who tell lies. When they lie, they refuse to pay any attention to me,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,9,7,"So the Lord who rules over all says, “I will put them through the fire to test them. What else can I do? My people are so sinful!"
Jeremiah,9,8,Their tongues are like deadly arrows. They tell lies. With their mouths all of them speak kindly to their neighbors. But in their hearts they set traps for them.
Jeremiah,9,9,Shouldn’t I punish them for this?” announces the Lord. “Shouldn’t I pay back the nation that does these things?”
Jeremiah,9,10,I will cry and mourn over the mountains. I will sing a song of sadness about the desert grasslands. They are dry and empty. No one travels through them. The mooing of cattle isn’t heard there. The birds have flown away. All the animals are gone.
Jeremiah,9,11,"The Lord says, “I will knock down all of Jerusalem’s buildings. I will make it a home for wild dogs. The towns of Judah will be completely destroyed. No one will be able to live in them.”"
Jeremiah,9,12,Who is wise enough to understand these things? Who has been taught by the Lord ? Who can explain them? Why has the land been destroyed so completely? Why has it become like a desert that no one can go across?
Jeremiah,9,13,"The Lord answered me, “Because my people have turned away from my law. I gave it to them. But they have not kept it. They have not obeyed me."
Jeremiah,9,14,"Instead, they have done what their stubborn hearts wanted them to do. They have worshiped the gods that are named Baal. They have done what their people have taught them to do through the years.”"
Jeremiah,9,15,"So now the Lord who rules over all speaks. He is the God of Israel. He says, “I will make these people eat bitter food. I will make them drink poisoned water."
Jeremiah,9,16,I will scatter them among the nations. They and their people before them didn’t know about these nations. With swords I will chase these people. I will hunt them down until I have destroyed them.”
Jeremiah,9,17,"The Lord rules over all. He says, “Here is something I want you to think about. Send for the women who mourn for the dead. Send for the most skilled among them.”"
Jeremiah,9,18,Let them come quickly and weep for us. Let them cry until tears flow from our eyes. Let them weep until water pours out of our eyes.
Jeremiah,9,19,"People are heard weeping in Zion. They are saying, “We are destroyed! We are filled with shame! We must leave our land. Our houses have been torn down.”"
Jeremiah,9,20,"You women, hear the Lord ’s message. Listen to what he’s saying. Teach your daughters how to mourn for the dead. Teach one another a song of sadness."
Jeremiah,9,21,Death has climbed in through our windows. It has entered our forts. Death has removed the children from the streets. It has taken the young men out of the market.
Jeremiah,9,22,"Say, “The Lord announces, “ ‘Dead bodies will be like human waste lying in the open fields. They will lie there like grain that is cut down at harvest time. No one will gather them up.’ ”"
Jeremiah,9,23,"The Lord says, “Do not let wise people brag about how wise they are. Do not let strong people boast about how strong they are. Do not let rich people brag about how rich they are."
Jeremiah,9,24,"But here is what the one who brags should boast about. They should brag that they have the understanding to know me. I want them to know that I am the Lord. No matter what I do on earth, I am always kind, fair and right. And I take delight in this,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,9,25,"“The days are coming when I will judge people,” announces the Lord . “I will punish all those who are circumcised only in their bodies."
Jeremiah,9,26,"That includes the people of Egypt, Judah, Edom, Ammon and Moab. It also includes all those who live in the desert in places far away. None of the people in these nations is really circumcised. And not even the people of Israel are circumcised in their hearts.”"
Jeremiah,10,1,"People of Israel, listen to what the Lord is telling you."
Jeremiah,10,2,"He says, “Do not follow the practices of other nations. Do not be terrified by warnings in the sky. Do not be afraid, even though the nations are terrified by them."
Jeremiah,10,3,The practices of these nations are worthless. People cut a tree out of the forest. A skilled worker shapes the wood with a sharp tool.
Jeremiah,10,4,Others decorate it with silver and gold. They use a hammer to nail it to the floor. They want to keep it from falling down.
Jeremiah,10,5,The statues of their gods can’t speak. They are like scarecrows in a field of cucumbers. Their statues have to be carried around because they can’t walk. So do not be afraid of their gods. They can’t do you any harm. And they can’t do you any good either.”
Jeremiah,10,6," Lord , no one is like you. You are great. You are mighty and powerful."
Jeremiah,10,7,"King of the nations, everyone should have respect for you. That’s what people should give you. Among all the wise leaders of the nations there is no one like you. No one can compare with you in all their kingdoms."
Jeremiah,10,8,All of them are foolish. They don’t have any sense. They think they are taught by worthless wooden gods.
Jeremiah,10,9,Hammered silver is brought from Tarshish. Gold is brought from Uphaz. People skilled in working with wood and gold make a statue. Then they put blue and purple clothes on it. The whole thing is made by skilled workers.
Jeremiah,10,10,"But you are the only true God. You are the only living God. You are the King who rules forever. When you are angry, the earth trembles with fear. The nations can’t stand up under your anger."
Jeremiah,10,11,"The Lord speaks to the Jews living in Babylon. He says, “Here is what you must tell the people of the nations. Tell them, ‘Your gods did not make the heavens and the earth. In fact, these gods will disappear from the earth. They will vanish from under the heavens.’ ”"
Jeremiah,10,12,But God used his power to make the earth. His wisdom set the world in place. His understanding spread out the heavens.
Jeremiah,10,13,"When he thunders, the waters in the heavens roar. He makes clouds rise from one end of the earth to the other. He sends lightning along with the rain. He brings the wind out from his storerooms."
Jeremiah,10,14,No one has any sense or knows anything at all. Everyone who works with gold is put to shame by his gods. The metal gods he has made are fakes. They can’t even breathe.
Jeremiah,10,15,"They are worthless things that people make fun of. When the Lord judges them, they will be destroyed."
Jeremiah,10,16,The God of Jacob is not like them. He gives his people everything they need. He made everything that exists. And that includes Israel. They are the people who belong to him. His name is the Lord Who Rules Over All.
Jeremiah,10,17,"People of Jerusalem, your enemies have surrounded you. They are attacking you. So gather up what belongs to you. Then leave the land."
Jeremiah,10,18,"The Lord says, “I am about to throw out of this land everyone who lives in it. I will bring trouble on them. They will be captured.”"
Jeremiah,10,19,"How terrible it will be for me! I’ve been wounded! And my wound can’t be healed! In spite of that, I said to myself, “I’m sick. But I’ll have to put up with it.”"
Jeremiah,10,20,Jerusalem is like a tent that has been destroyed. All its ropes have snapped. My people have gone away from me. Now no one is left to set up my tent. I have no one to set up my shelter.
Jeremiah,10,21,The leaders of my people are like shepherds who don’t have any sense. They don’t ask the Lord for advice. That’s why they don’t succeed. And that’s why their whole flock is scattered like sheep.
Jeremiah,10,22,Listen! A message is coming! I hear the sound of a great army marching down from the north! It will turn Judah’s towns into a desert. They will become a home for wild dogs.
Jeremiah,10,23," Lord , I know that a person doesn’t control their own life. They don’t direct their own steps."
Jeremiah,10,24,"Correct me, Lord , but please be fair. Don’t correct me when you are angry. If you do, nothing will be left of me."
Jeremiah,10,25,Pour out your great anger on the nations. They don’t pay any attention to you. They refuse to worship you. They have destroyed the people of Jacob. They’ve wiped them out completely. They’ve also destroyed the land they lived in.
Jeremiah,11,1,"A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah. The Lord said,"
Jeremiah,11,2,“Listen to the terms of the covenant I made with my people of long ago. Tell Judah the terms still apply to them. Tell those who live in Jerusalem that they must obey them too.
Jeremiah,11,3,"I am the Lord , the God of Israel. So let the people know what I want them to do. Here is what I want you to tell them. ‘May the person who does not obey the terms of the covenant be under my curse."
Jeremiah,11,4,"I gave those terms to your people of long ago. That was when I brought them out of Egypt. I saved them out of that furnace that melts down iron and makes it pure.’ I said, ‘Obey me. Do everything I command you to do. Then you will be my people. And I will be your God."
Jeremiah,11,5,"I raised my hand and made a promise to your people of long ago. I promised them I would give them a land that had plenty of milk and honey.’ It is the land you own today. I kept my promise.” I replied, “Amen, Lord .”"
Jeremiah,11,6,"The Lord said to me, “Here is what I want you to announce in the towns of Judah. Say it also in the streets of Jerusalem. Tell the people, ‘Listen to the terms of my covenant. Obey them."
Jeremiah,11,7,"Long ago I brought your people up from Egypt. From that time until today, I warned them again and again. I said, “Obey me.”"
Jeremiah,11,8,"But they did not listen. They did not pay any attention to me. Instead, they did what their stubborn and evil hearts wanted them to do. So I brought down on them all the curses of the covenant. I commanded them to obey it. But they refused.’ ”"
Jeremiah,11,9,"The Lord continued, “The people of Judah have made some evil plans. So have those who live in Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,11,10,All of them have returned to the sins their people of long ago committed. Those people refused to listen to what I told them. And now the people of Israel and Judah alike have worshiped other gods and served them. They have broken the covenant I made with their people who lived before them.
Jeremiah,11,11,"So I say, ‘I will bring trouble on them. They will not be able to escape it. They will cry out to me. But I will not listen to them."
Jeremiah,11,12,The people of Jerusalem and of the towns of Judah will cry out. They will cry out to the gods they burn incense to. But those gods will not help them at all when trouble strikes them.
Jeremiah,11,13,"Judah, you have as many gods as you have towns. And in Jerusalem you have set up as many altars as there are streets. You are burning incense to that shameful god named Baal.’"
Jeremiah,11,14,"“Jeremiah, do not pray for these people. Do not make any appeal or request for them. They will call out to me when they are in trouble. But I will not listen to them."
Jeremiah,11,15,"“I love the people of Judah. But they are working out their evil plans along with many others. So what are they doing in my temple? Can meat that is offered to me keep me from punishing you? When you do evil things, you get a lot of pleasure from them.”"
Jeremiah,11,16,"People of Judah, the Lord once called you a healthy olive tree. He thought its fruit was beautiful. But now he will come with the roar of a mighty storm. He will set the tree on fire. And its branches will be broken."
Jeremiah,11,17,The Lord who rules over all planted you. But now he has ordered your enemies to destroy you. The people of Israel and Judah have both done what is evil. They have made the Lord very angry by burning incense to Baal.
Jeremiah,11,18,The Lord told me about the evil plans of my enemies. That’s how I knew about them. He showed me what they were doing.
Jeremiah,11,19,"I had been like a gentle lamb led off to be killed. I didn’t realize they had made plans against me. They had said, “Let’s destroy the tree and its fruit. Let’s take away his life. Then his name won’t be remembered anymore.”"
Jeremiah,11,20,"But Lord , you rule over all. You always judge fairly. You test people’s hearts and minds. So pay them back for what they’ve done. I’ve committed my cause to you."
Jeremiah,11,21,"The Lord says, “Jeremiah, here is what I am telling you about the people of Anathoth. They say they’re going to kill you. They are saying, ‘Don’t prophesy in the Lord ’s name. If you do, we will kill you with our own hands.’ ”"
Jeremiah,11,22,"So the Lord who rules over all says, “I will punish them. Their young men will be killed by swords. Their sons and daughters will die of hunger."
Jeremiah,11,23,Only a few people will be left alive. I will judge the people of Anathoth. I will destroy them when the time comes to punish them.”
Jeremiah,12,1," Lord , when I bring a matter to you, you always do what is right. But now I would like to speak with you about whether you are being fair. Why are sinful people successful? Why do those who can’t be trusted have an easy life?"
Jeremiah,12,2,You have planted them. Their roots are deep in the ground. They grow and produce fruit. They honor you by what they say. But their hearts are far away from you.
Jeremiah,12,3," Lord , you know me and see me. You test my thoughts about you. Drag those people off like sheep to be killed! Set them apart for the day of their death!"
Jeremiah,12,4,"How long will the land be thirsty for water? How long will the grass in every field be dry? The people who live in the land are evil. So the animals and birds have died. And that’s not all. The people are saying, “The Lord won’t see what happens to us.”"
Jeremiah,12,5,"The Lord says, “Suppose you have raced against people. And suppose they have worn you out. Then how would you be able to race against horses? Suppose you feel safe only in open country. Then how would you get along in the bushes near the Jordan River?"
Jeremiah,12,6,Even your relatives have turned against you. They are members of your own family. They have shouted loudly at you. They might say nice things about you. But do not trust them.
Jeremiah,12,7,"“I will turn my back on my people. I will desert my land. I love the people of Judah. In spite of that, I will hand them over to their enemies."
Jeremiah,12,8,My land has become to me like a lion in the forest. It roars at me. So I hate it.
Jeremiah,12,9,"My own land has become like a spotted hawk. And other hawks surround it and attack it. Come, all you wild animals! Gather together! Come together to eat up my land."
Jeremiah,12,10,Many shepherds will destroy my vineyard. They will walk all over it. They will turn my pleasant vineyard into a dry and empty land.
Jeremiah,12,11,My vineyard will become a desert. It will be dry and empty in my sight. The whole land will be completely destroyed. And no one even cares.
Jeremiah,12,12,Many will come to destroy it. They will gather on the bare hilltops in the desert. I will use them as my sword to destroy my people. They will kill them from one end of the land to the other. No one will be safe.
Jeremiah,12,13,People will plant wheat. But all they will gather is thorns. They will wear themselves out. But they will not have anything to show for it. I am very angry with them. So they will be ashamed of the crop they gather.”
Jeremiah,12,14,Here is what the Lord says. “All my evil neighbors have taken over the land I gave my people Israel. So I will pull them up by their roots from the lands they live in. And I will pull up the roots of the people of Judah from among them.
Jeremiah,12,15,"But after I pull up those nations, I will give my tender love to them again. I will bring all of them back to their own lands. I will take all of them back to their own countries."
Jeremiah,12,16,"Suppose those nations learn to follow the practices of my people. And they make their promises in my name. When they promise, they say, ‘You can be sure that the Lord is alive.’ They do this just as they once taught my people to make promises in Baal’s name. Then I will give them a place among my people."
Jeremiah,12,17,"But what if one of those nations does not listen? Then you can be sure of this. I will pull it up by the roots and destroy it,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,13,1,"The Lord said to me, “Go and buy a linen belt. Put it around your waist. But do not let it get wet.”"
Jeremiah,13,2,"So I bought a belt, just as the Lord had told me to do. And I put it around my waist."
Jeremiah,13,3,"Then another message from the Lord came to me. The Lord said,"
Jeremiah,13,4,“Take off the belt you bought and are wearing around your waist. Go to Perath. Hide the belt there in a crack in the rocks.”
Jeremiah,13,5,So I went and hid it at Perath. I did just as the Lord had told me to do.
Jeremiah,13,6,"Many days later the Lord said to me, “Go to Perath. Get the belt I told you to hide there.”"
Jeremiah,13,7,So I went to Perath. I dug up the belt. I took it from the place where I had hidden it. But it had rotted. It was completely useless.
Jeremiah,13,8,"Then another message from the Lord came to me. The Lord said,"
Jeremiah,13,9,"“In the same way, I will destroy Judah’s pride. And I will destroy the great pride of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,13,10,These people are evil. They refuse to listen to what I say. They do what their stubborn hearts want them to do. They chase after other gods. They serve them and worship them. So they will be like this belt. They will be completely useless.
Jeremiah,13,11,"A belt is tied around a person’s waist. In the same way, I tied all the people of Israel to me. I also tied all the people of Judah to me like a belt. I wanted them to be my people. They should have brought me fame and praise and honor. But they have not listened to me,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,13,12,"“Tell them, ‘The Lord is the God of Israel. He says, “Every wineskin should be filled with wine.” ’ Here is what the people might say to you. ‘Don’t we know that every wineskin should be filled with wine?’"
Jeremiah,13,13,"If they do, here is what you must tell them. ‘The Lord says, “I am going to fill with wine everyone who lives in this land. I will make the kings who sit on David’s throne drunk. And I will fill with wine the priests, the prophets and everyone who lives in Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,13,14,"I will smash them against one another. I will punish parents and children alike,” announces the Lord . “I will not feel sorry for them. I will not show them any kindness. My tender love for them will not keep me from destroying them.” ’ ”"
Jeremiah,13,15,"People of Judah, listen to me. Pay attention and don’t be proud. The Lord has spoken."
Jeremiah,13,16,Give glory to the Lord your God. Honor him before he sends darkness to cover the land. Do this before you trip and fall on the darkened hills. You hope that light will come. But he will turn it into thick darkness. He will change it to deep shadows.
Jeremiah,13,17,"If you don’t listen, I will weep in secret. Because you are so proud, I will weep bitterly. Tears will flow from my eyes. The Lord ’s flock will be taken away as prisoners."
Jeremiah,13,18,"Speak to the king and his mother. Tell them, “Come down from your thrones. Your glorious crowns are about to fall from your heads.”"
Jeremiah,13,19,The gates of the cities in the Negev Desert will be shut tight. There won’t be anyone to open them. Everyone in Judah will be carried away as prisoners. You will be completely taken away.
Jeremiah,13,20,"Jerusalem, look up! Your enemies are coming from the north. Where is the flock you were supposed to take care of? Where are the sheep you were so proud of?"
Jeremiah,13,21,You have worked hard to make special friends. But the Lord will let them rule over you. Then what will you say? Suffering will take hold of you. It will be like the pain of a woman having a baby.
Jeremiah,13,22,"Suppose you ask yourself, “Why has this happened to me?” It’s because you have committed so many sins. That’s the reason your skirt has been torn off. That’s why your body has been treated so badly."
Jeremiah,13,23,Can people from Ethiopia change their skin? Can leopards change their spots? It’s the same with you. You have always done what is evil. So how can you do what is good?
Jeremiah,13,24,"The Lord says, “I will scatter you like straw that the desert wind blows away."
Jeremiah,13,25,"This is what will happen to you. I have appointed it for you,” announces the Lord. “You have forgotten me. You have trusted in other gods."
Jeremiah,13,26,So I will pull your skirt up over your face. Then people will see the shame of your naked body.
Jeremiah,13,27,"They will see that you have not been faithful to me. You have committed adultery with other gods. And you have acted like a prostitute who does not have any shame. I have seen what you did on the hills and in the fields. And I hate it. How terrible it will be for you, Jerusalem! How long will you choose to be ‘unclean’?”"
Jeremiah,14,1,"A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah. He told Jeremiah there wouldn’t be any rain in the land. The Lord said,"
Jeremiah,14,2,“Judah is filled with sadness. Its cities are wasting away. The people weep for the land. Crying is heard in Jerusalem.
Jeremiah,14,3,The nobles send their servants to get water. They go to the wells. But they do not find any water. They return with empty jars. They are terrified. They do not have any hope. They cover their heads.
Jeremiah,14,4,The ground is dry and cracked. There isn’t any rain in the land. The farmers are terrified. They cover their heads.
Jeremiah,14,5,Even the female deer in the fields desert their newborn fawns. There isn’t any grass to eat.
Jeremiah,14,6,Wild donkeys stand on the bare hilltops. They long for water as wild dogs do. Their eyesight fails because they do not have any food to eat.”
Jeremiah,14,7," Lord , our sins are a witness against us. But do something for the honor of your name. We have often turned away from you. We’ve sinned against you."
Jeremiah,14,8,You are Israel’s only hope. You save us when we’re in trouble. Why are you like a stranger to us? Why are you like a traveler who stays for only one night?
Jeremiah,14,9,"Why are you like a man taken by surprise? Why are you like a soldier who can’t save anyone? Lord , you are among us. And we are your people. Please don’t desert us!"
Jeremiah,14,10,"The Lord gave Jeremiah a message about these people. The Lord said, “They really love to wander away from me. Their feet go down the wrong path. I do not accept these people. I will remember the evil things they have done. I will punish them for their sins.”"
Jeremiah,14,11,"The Lord continued, “Do not pray that things will go well with them."
Jeremiah,14,12,"Even if they go without food, I will not listen to their cry for help. They might sacrifice burnt offerings and grain offerings. But I will not accept them. Instead, I will destroy them with war, hunger and plague.”"
Jeremiah,14,13,"But I said, “ Lord and King, the prophets keep telling them something else. They say, ‘You won’t have to suffer from war or hunger. Instead, the Lord will give you peace and rest in this place.’ ”"
Jeremiah,14,14,"Then the Lord said to me, “The prophets are prophesying lies in my name. I have not sent them or appointed them. I have not even spoken to them. Everything they tell you about their visions or secret knowledge is a lie. They pretend to bring you messages from other gods. They try to get you to believe their own mistaken ideas."
Jeremiah,14,15,"So here is what I am saying about the prophets who are prophesying in my name. I did not send them. But they are saying, ‘No war or hunger will come to this land.’ Those same prophets will die because of war and hunger."
Jeremiah,14,16,And the people they are prophesying to will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem. They will die because of hunger and war. No one will bury them. No one will bury their wives and children. I will pour out trouble on them. That is exactly what they should get.
Jeremiah,14,17,"“Jeremiah, give them this message. Tell them, “ ‘Let tears flow from my eyes. Let them pour out night and day. Never let them stop. The people of my own nation have suffered a terrible wound. They have been crushed."
Jeremiah,14,18,Suppose I go into the country. Then I see people who have been killed by swords. Or suppose I go into the city. Then I see people who have died of hunger. Prophet and priest alike have gone to a land they hadn’t known about before.’ ”
Jeremiah,14,19," Lord , have you completely turned your back on Judah? Do you hate the city of Zion? Why have you made us suffer? We can’t be healed. We hoped peace would come. But nothing good has happened to us. We hoped we would finally be healed. But all we got was terror."
Jeremiah,14,20," Lord , we admit we’ve done evil things. We also admit that our people of long ago were guilty. It’s true that we’ve sinned against you."
Jeremiah,14,21,"For the honor of your name, don’t turn your back on us. Don’t bring shame on your glorious throne in the temple. Remember the covenant you made with us. Please don’t break it."
Jeremiah,14,22,"Do any of the worthless gods of the nations bring rain? Do the skies send down showers all by themselves? No. Lord our God, you send the rain. So we put our hope in you. You are the one who does all these things."
Jeremiah,15,1,"Then the Lord said to me, “Suppose Moses and Samuel were standing in front of me. Even then my heart would not feel sorry for these people. Send them away from me! Let them go!"
Jeremiah,15,2,"Suppose these people ask you, ‘Where should we go?’ Then tell them, ‘The Lord says, “ ‘ “Those I have appointed to die will die. Those I have appointed to be killed by swords will be killed by swords. Those I have appointed to die of hunger will die of hunger. Those I have appointed to be taken away as prisoners will be taken away.” ’"
Jeremiah,15,3,"“I will send four kinds of destroyers against them,” announces the Lord . “Swords will kill them. Dogs will drag them away. Birds will eat them up. And wild animals will destroy them."
Jeremiah,15,4,I will make all the kingdoms on earth hate them. That will happen because of what Manasseh did in Jerusalem. He was king of Judah and the son of Hezekiah.
Jeremiah,15,5,"“Jerusalem, who will have pity on you? Who will mourn for you? Who will stop to ask how you are doing?"
Jeremiah,15,6,"You have said no to me,” announces the Lord. “You keep on turning away from me. So I will reach out and destroy you. I am tired of showing you pity."
Jeremiah,15,7,I will stand at the city gates of the land. I will separate the straw from the grain. I will destroy my people. I will bring great sorrow on them. They have not changed their ways.
Jeremiah,15,8,I will increase the number of their widows. There will be more of them than the grains of sand on the seashore. At noon I will bring a destroyer against the mothers of the young men among my people. All at once I will bring down on them great suffering and terror.
Jeremiah,15,9,"Mothers who have many children will grow weak. They will take their last breath. The sun will set on them while it is still day. They will be dishonored and put to shame. All those who are left alive I will kill by swords. I will have their enemies do this,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,15,10,"My mother, I wish I had never been born! The whole land opposes me. They fight against me. I haven’t made loans to anyone. And I haven’t borrowed anything. But everyone curses me anyway."
Jeremiah,15,11,"The Lord said, “Jeremiah, I will keep you safe for a good purpose. I will make your enemies ask you to pray for them. They will make their appeal to you when they are in great trouble."
Jeremiah,15,12,"“People of Judah, the armies of Babylon will come from the north. They are as strong as iron and bronze. Can anyone break their power?"
Jeremiah,15,13,I will give away your wealth and your treasures. Your enemies will carry off everything. And they will not pay anything for it. That will happen because you have sinned so much. You have done it throughout your country.
Jeremiah,15,14,I will make you slaves to your enemies. You will serve them in a land you have not known about before. My anger will start a fire that will burn you up.”
Jeremiah,15,15," Lord , you understand how much I’m suffering. Show concern for me. Take care of me. Pay back those who are trying to harm me. You are patient. Don’t take my life away from me. Think about how much shame I suffer because of you."
Jeremiah,15,16,"When I received your words, I ate them. They filled me with joy. My heart took delight in them. Lord God who rules over all, I belong to you."
Jeremiah,15,17,I never sat around with those who go to wild parties. I never had a good time with them. I sat alone because you had put your powerful hand on me. Your anger against sin was burning inside me.
Jeremiah,15,18,Why does my pain never end? Why is my wound so deep? Why can’t I ever get well? To me you are like a stream that runs dry. You are like a spring that doesn’t have any water.
Jeremiah,15,19,"So the Lord says to Jeremiah, “If you turn away from your sins, I will heal you. And then you will be able to serve me. Speak words that are worthy, not worthless. Then you will be speaking for me. Let these people turn to you. But you must not turn to them."
Jeremiah,15,20,"I will make you like a wall to them. I will make you like a strong bronze wall. The people will fight against you. But they will not overcome you. I am with you. I will save you,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,15,21,“I will save you from the hands of evil people. I will set you free from those who treat you badly.”
Jeremiah,16,1,"A message from the Lord came to me. He said,"
Jeremiah,16,2,"“Jeremiah, you must not get married. You must not have any sons or daughters in this land.”"
Jeremiah,16,3,"Here is the Lord ’s message about the children born in this place. He says about them and their parents,"
Jeremiah,16,4,"“Some of them will die of deadly sicknesses. No one will mourn for them. Their bodies will not be buried. Instead, they will be like human waste lying there on the ground. Others will die because of war and hunger. Their bodies will not be buried. Instead, they will become food for the birds and the wild animals.”"
Jeremiah,16,5,"The Lord says, “Jeremiah, suppose a meal is being served because someone has died. Do not enter any house where that is happening. Do not go there to mourn or to comfort the family. I will not bless these people anymore. I have taken my love and pity away from them,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,16,6,“Important and unimportant people alike will die in this land. Their bodies will not be buried. No one will mourn for them. No one will cut themselves or shave their head for the dead.
Jeremiah,16,7,No one will offer food or drink to comfort those who mourn for the dead. No one will do this even if someone’s father or mother has died.
Jeremiah,16,8,“Do not enter a house where a feast is being held. Do not sit down there to eat and drink.
Jeremiah,16,9,"I am the Lord who rules over all. I am the God of Israel. I am telling you, ‘In your days I will judge your people. You will see it with your own eyes. I will put an end to the sounds of joy and gladness here in Jerusalem. The voices of brides and grooms will not be heard anymore.’"
Jeremiah,16,10,"“Tell these people all these things. They will ask you, ‘Why has the Lord decided to send so much trouble on us? We haven’t done anything wrong. We haven’t committed any sins against the Lord our God.’"
Jeremiah,16,11,"When they say this, here is what you should tell them. ‘I did it because your people of long ago deserted me,’ announces the Lord . ‘They followed other gods. They served them and worshiped them. They deserted me. They did not obey my law."
Jeremiah,16,12,But you have done more evil things than they did. All of you are doing what your stubborn and evil hearts want you to do. You are not obeying me.
Jeremiah,16,13,So I will throw you out of this land. I will send you away to another land. Neither you nor your people of long ago have known about it. There you will serve other gods day and night. And I will not give you any help.’
Jeremiah,16,14,"“But a new day is coming,” announces the Lord . “At that time here is what people will no longer say. ‘As sure as he is alive, the Lord brought the Israelites up out of Egypt.’"
Jeremiah,16,15,"Instead, they will say, ‘The Lord brought the Israelites up out of the land of the north. He gathered them out of all the countries where he had forced them to go. And that’s just as sure as he is alive.’ I will bring them back to the land I gave their people of long ago."
Jeremiah,16,16,"“But now I will send for many fishermen,” announces the Lord . “They will catch some of these people. After that, I will send for many hunters. They will hunt down the others on every mountain and hill. They will bring them out of the cracks in the rocks."
Jeremiah,16,17,My eyes see everything these people do. What they do is not hidden from me. I always see their sin.
Jeremiah,16,18,I will pay them back double for their sin and the evil things they have done. They have made my land ‘unclean.’ They have set up lifeless statues of their evil gods. They have filled my land with them. I hate those gods.”
Jeremiah,16,19," Lord , you give me strength. You are like a fort to me. When I’m in trouble, I go to you for safety. The nations will come to you from one end of the earth to the other. They will gather together and say, “Our people of long ago didn’t own anything except statues of gods. The statues were worthless. They didn’t do them any good."
Jeremiah,16,20,Do human beings really make their own gods? Yes. But they aren’t really gods at all!”
Jeremiah,16,21,"The Lord says, “So I will teach them about myself. This time I will show them how powerful and mighty I am. Then they will know that I am the Lord."
Jeremiah,17,1,“Judah’s sin is carved with an iron tool. It is written with the flint point of the tool. It is carved on the tablets of their hearts. It is written on the horns that stick out from the corners of their altars.
Jeremiah,17,2,Even their children offer sacrifices to other gods on those altars. They use the poles that were made to worship the female god named Asherah. They worship strange gods beside the green trees and on the high hills.
Jeremiah,17,3,I will give away my holy Mount Zion to the Babylonians. Your enemies will carry off your wealth and all your treasures. I will give away your high places. That will happen because you have sinned. You have done it throughout your country.
Jeremiah,17,4,You will lose the land I gave you. And it will be your own fault. I will make you slaves to your enemies. You will serve them in a land you didn’t know about before. You have set my anger on fire. It will burn forever.”
Jeremiah,17,5,"The Lord says, “Those who trust in human beings are under my curse. They depend on human strength. Their hearts turn away from me."
Jeremiah,17,6,They will be like a bush in a dry and empty land. They will not enjoy success when it comes. They will live in dry places in the desert. It is a land of salt where no one else lives.
Jeremiah,17,7,“But I will bless anyone who trusts in me. I will do good things for the person who depends on me.
Jeremiah,17,8,They will be like a tree planted near water. It sends out its roots beside a stream. It is not afraid when heat comes. Its leaves are always green. It does not worry when there is no rain. It always bears fruit.”
Jeremiah,17,9,A human heart is more dishonest than anything else. It can’t be healed. Who can understand it?
Jeremiah,17,10,"The Lord says, “I look deep down inside human hearts. I see what is in people’s minds. I reward each person in keeping with their conduct. I bless them based on what they have done.”"
Jeremiah,17,11,"Some people get rich by doing sinful things. They are like a partridge that hatches eggs it didn’t lay. When their lives are half over, their riches will desert them. In the end they will prove how foolish they have been."
Jeremiah,17,12,Our temple is where the Lord ’s glorious throne is. From the beginning it has been high and lifted up.
Jeremiah,17,13," Lord , you are Israel’s only hope. Everyone who deserts you will be put to shame. The names of those who turn away from you will be listed among the dead. Lord , they have deserted you. You are the spring of water that gives life."
Jeremiah,17,14," Lord , heal me. Then I will be healed. Save me from my enemies. Then I will be saved. You are the one I praise."
Jeremiah,17,15,"They keep saying to me, “What has happened to the message the Lord gave you? Let it come true right now!”"
Jeremiah,17,16,I haven’t run away from being the shepherd of your people. You know I haven’t wanted the day of Jerusalem’s fall to come. You are aware of every word that comes from my lips.
Jeremiah,17,17,"Don’t be a terror to me. When I’m in trouble, I go to you for safety."
Jeremiah,17,18,Let those who attack me be put to shame. But keep me from shame. Let them be terrified. But keep me from terror. Bring the day of trouble on them. Destroy them once and for all.
Jeremiah,17,19,"The Lord said to me, “Go. Stand at the city gate called the Gate of the People. That is where the kings of Judah go in and out. Then stand at all the other gates of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,17,20,"Say, ‘Listen to the Lord ’s message, you kings of Judah and all you people of Judah and Jerusalem. You always come through these gates."
Jeremiah,17,21,"The Lord says, “Make sure you do not carry a load on the Sabbath day. Do not bring it through the gates of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,17,22,"Do not bring a load out of your houses on the Sabbath day. Do not do any work on that day. Instead, keep the Sabbath day holy. Do as I commanded your people of long ago."
Jeremiah,17,23,But they did not listen. They did not pay any attention to me. They were stubborn. They would not listen or pay attention when I corrected them.
Jeremiah,17,24,"Be careful to obey me,” announces the Lord . “Do not bring a load through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day. Instead, keep the Sabbath day holy. Do not do any work on it."
Jeremiah,17,25,Then kings who sit on David’s throne will come through the gates of this city. They and their officials will come riding in chariots and on horses. The people of Judah and Jerusalem will come along with them. And this city will always have people living in it.
Jeremiah,17,26,"Some will come from the towns of Judah. And some will come in from the villages around Jerusalem. Others will come from the territory of Benjamin. And others will come in from the western hills. Still others will come from the central hill country and the Negev Desert. All of them will bring burnt offerings and sacrifices. They will come bringing grain offerings, incense and thank offerings. They will take all these offerings to my house."
Jeremiah,17,27,But what if you do not obey me? Suppose you do not keep the Sabbath day holy. And suppose you carry a load through the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. Then I will start a fire that can’t be put out. It will begin at the gates of Jerusalem. It will destroy its mighty towers.” ’ ”
Jeremiah,18,1,"A message from the Lord came to me. He said,"
Jeremiah,18,2,"“Jeremiah, go down to the potter’s house. I will give you my message there.”"
Jeremiah,18,3,So I went down to the potter’s house. I saw him working at his wheel.
Jeremiah,18,4,His hands were shaping a pot out of clay. But he saw that something was wrong with it. So he formed it into another pot. He shaped it in the way that seemed best to him.
Jeremiah,18,5,Then the Lord ’s message came to me.
Jeremiah,18,6,"“People of Israel, I can do with you just as this potter does,” announces the Lord . “The clay is in the potter’s hand. And you are in my hand, people of Israel."
Jeremiah,18,7,Suppose I announce that something will happen to a nation or kingdom. Suppose I announce that it will be pulled up by the roots. And I announce that it will be torn down and destroyed.
Jeremiah,18,8,But suppose the nation I warned turns away from its sins. Then I will not do what I said I would. I will not bring trouble on it as I had planned.
Jeremiah,18,9,But suppose I announce that a nation or kingdom is going to be built up and planted.
Jeremiah,18,10,And then it does what is evil in my eyes. It does not obey me. Then I will think again about the good things I had wanted to do for it.
Jeremiah,18,11,"“So speak to the people of Judah and Jerusalem. Tell them, ‘The Lord says, “Look! I am making plans against you. I am going to bring trouble on you. So each one of you must turn from your evil ways. Change the way you live and act.” ’"
Jeremiah,18,12,"But they will reply, ‘It’s no use. We will continue to do what we’ve already planned. All of us will do what our stubborn and evil hearts want us to do.’ ”"
Jeremiah,18,13,"So the Lord says, “Ask the nations a question. Say to them, ‘Who has ever heard anything like this? The people of Israel have done a very horrible thing."
Jeremiah,18,14,Does the snow ever disappear from Lebanon’s rocky slopes? Do its cool waters ever stop flowing from places far away?
Jeremiah,18,15,But my people have forgotten me. They burn incense to worthless gods. Their gods made them trip and fall as they walked on the old paths. They made them use side roads instead of roads that were built up.
Jeremiah,18,16,So their land will become a horrible thing. People will make fun of it again and again. All those who pass by it will be shocked. They will shake their heads.
Jeremiah,18,17,I will sweep over my people like a wind from the east. I will use the Babylonians to scatter them. I will show them my back and not my face. I will desert them when their day of trouble comes.’ ”
Jeremiah,18,18,"They said, “Come on. Let’s make plans against Jeremiah. We’ll still have priests to teach us the law. We’ll always have wise people to give us advice. We’ll have prophets to bring us messages from the Lord . So come on. Let’s speak out against Jeremiah. We shouldn’t pay any attention to what he says.”"
Jeremiah,18,19," Lord , please listen to me! Hear what my enemies are saying about me!"
Jeremiah,18,20,Should the good things I’ve done be paid back with evil? But my enemies have dug a pit for me. Remember that I stood in front of you and spoke up for them. I tried to turn your anger away from them.
Jeremiah,18,21,So let their children die of hunger. Let my enemies be killed in war. Let their wives lose their children and husbands. Let their men be put to death. Let their young men be killed in battle.
Jeremiah,18,22,Bring their enemies against them without warning. Let cries be heard from their houses. They have dug a pit to capture me. They have hidden traps for my feet.
Jeremiah,18,23,"But Lord , you know all about their plans to kill me. Don’t forgive their crimes. Don’t erase their sins from your sight. Destroy my enemies. Punish them when the time to show your anger comes."
Jeremiah,19,1,"The Lord said to Jeremiah, “Go and buy a clay jar from a potter. Take along some of the elders of the people. Also tell some of the priests to go with you."
Jeremiah,19,2,Go out to the Valley of Ben Hinnom. Stand near the entrance of the gate where broken pieces of pottery are thrown away. There announce the message I give you.
Jeremiah,19,3,"Tell the people, ‘Listen to the Lord ’s message, you kings of Judah and people of Jerusalem. The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel. He says, “Listen! I am going to bring trouble on Jerusalem. It will be so horrible that it will make the ears of everyone who hears about it ring."
Jeremiah,19,4,"My people have deserted me. They have made this city a place where other gods are worshiped. They have burned incense to them here. They, their people of long ago and the kings of Judah had never known these gods. My people have also filled this place with the blood of those who aren’t guilty."
Jeremiah,19,5,They have built the high places where they worship Baal. There they sacrifice their children in the fire as offerings to Baal. That is something I did not command or talk about. It did not even enter my mind.
Jeremiah,19,6,"So watch out!” announces the Lord . “The days are coming when people will not call this place Topheth anymore. And they will not call it the Valley of Ben Hinnom either. Instead, they will call it the Valley of Death."
Jeremiah,19,7,“ ‘ “In this place I will make the plans of Judah and Jerusalem as useless as a broken jar. I will use their enemies to kill my people by swords. They will die at the hands of those who want to take their lives. I will give their dead bodies as food to the birds and the wild animals.
Jeremiah,19,8,I will completely destroy this city. I will make it a horrible thing. People will make fun of it. All those who pass by it will be shocked. They will laugh at its people because of all their wounds.
Jeremiah,19,9,I will make the people of this city eat their sons and daughters. And they will eat one another. They will do this because things will be so bad during the attack. The enemies who want to take their lives will bring all this trouble on them.” ’
Jeremiah,19,10,"“Jeremiah, break the jar while those who go with you are watching."
Jeremiah,19,11,"Tell them, ‘Here is what the Lord who rules over all says. “This potter’s jar is smashed and can’t be repaired. And I will smash this nation and this city. People will bury their dead in Topheth. But they will run out of room."
Jeremiah,19,12,"Here is what I will do to Jerusalem and those who live here,” ’ announces the Lord . ‘ “I will make this city like Topheth."
Jeremiah,19,13,The houses in Jerusalem will be made ‘unclean’ like Topheth. So will the houses of the kings of Judah. All these people burned incense on their roofs to all the stars. They poured out drink offerings to other gods.” ’ ”
Jeremiah,19,14,"Then Jeremiah returned from Topheth. That’s where the Lord had sent him to prophesy. Jeremiah stood in the courtyard of the Lord ’s temple. He spoke to all the people. He said,"
Jeremiah,19,15,"“The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel. He says, ‘Listen! I am going to punish this city and all the villages around it. I am going to bring against them all the trouble I have announced. That’s because my people were stubborn. They would not listen to what I said.’ ”"
Jeremiah,20,1,Pashhur the priest was the official in charge of the Lord ’s temple. He was the son of Immer. Pashhur heard Jeremiah prophesying that Jerusalem would be destroyed.
Jeremiah,20,2,So he had Jeremiah the prophet beaten. Then Pashhur put him in prison at the Upper Gate of Benjamin at the Lord ’s temple.
Jeremiah,20,3,"The next day Pashhur set him free. Jeremiah said to him, “The Lord ’s name for you isn’t Pashhur. The Lord ’s name for you is Terror on Every Side."
Jeremiah,20,4,"The Lord says to you, ‘I will make you a terror to yourself. You will also be a terror to all your friends. With your own eyes you will see them die. Their enemies will kill them with swords. I will hand over all the people of Judah to the king of Babylon. He will carry them away to Babylon or kill them with swords."
Jeremiah,20,5,I will hand over all the wealth of this city to Judah’s enemies. I will give them all its products and everything of value. I will turn over to them all the treasures that belonged to the kings of Judah. They will take these things and carry them off to Babylon.
Jeremiah,20,6,"Pashhur, you and everyone who lives in your house will also be forced to go there. You have prophesied lies to all your friends. So all of you will die and be buried in Babylon.’ ”"
Jeremiah,20,7,"You tricked me, Lord , and I was tricked. You overpowered me and won. People make fun of me all day long. Everyone laughs at me."
Jeremiah,20,8,"Every time I speak, I cry out. All you ever tell me to talk about is fighting and trouble. Your message has brought me nothing but dishonor. It has made me suffer shame all day long."
Jeremiah,20,9,"Sometimes I think, “I won’t talk about his message anymore. I’ll never speak in his name again.” But then your message burns in my heart. It’s like a fire deep inside my bones. I’m tired of holding it in. In fact, I can’t."
Jeremiah,20,10,"I hear many people whispering, “There is terror on every side! Bring charges against Jeremiah! Let’s bring charges against him!” All my friends are waiting for me to slip. They are saying, “Perhaps he will be tricked into making a mistake. Then we’ll win out over him. We’ll get even with him.”"
Jeremiah,20,11,But you are with me like a mighty warrior. So those who are trying to harm me will trip and fall. They won’t win out over me. They will fail. They’ll be totally put to shame. Their dishonor will never be forgotten.
Jeremiah,20,12," Lord , you rule over all. You test those who do what is right. You see what is in people’s hearts and minds. So pay them back for what they’ve done. I’ve committed my cause to you."
Jeremiah,20,13,"Sing to the Lord , you people! Give praise to him! He saves the lives of people in need. He saves them from the power of sinful people."
Jeremiah,20,14,May the day I was born be cursed! May the day I was born to my mother not be blessed!
Jeremiah,20,15,"May the man who brought my father the news be cursed! He’s the one who made my father very glad. He said, “You have had a baby! It’s a boy!”"
Jeremiah,20,16,May that man be like the towns the Lord destroyed without pity. May that man hear loud weeping in the morning. May he hear a battle cry at noon.
Jeremiah,20,17,He should have killed me in my mother’s body. He should have made my mother my grave. He should have let her body stay large forever.
Jeremiah,20,18,Why did I ever come out of my mother’s body? I’ve seen nothing but trouble and sorrow. My days will end in shame.
Jeremiah,21,1,"A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah. It came when King Zedekiah sent Pashhur to Jeremiah. Pashhur was the son of Malkijah. Zedekiah sent Zephaniah the priest along with him. Zephaniah was the son of Maaseiah. They said to Jeremiah,"
Jeremiah,21,2,“Ask the Lord to help us. Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is attacking us. In the past the Lord did wonderful things for us. Maybe he’ll do them again. Then Nebuchadnezzar will pull his armies back from us.”
Jeremiah,21,3,"But Jeremiah answered them, “Tell Zedekiah and his people,"
Jeremiah,21,4,"‘The Lord is the God of Israel. He says, “The king of Babylon and his armies are all around this city. They are getting ready to attack you. You have weapons of war in your hands to fight against them. But I am about to turn your weapons against you. And I will bring your enemies inside this city."
Jeremiah,21,5,I myself will fight against you. I will reach out my powerful hand and mighty arm. I will come against you with all my great anger.
Jeremiah,21,6,I will strike down those who live in this city. I will kill people and animals alike. They will die of a terrible plague.
Jeremiah,21,7,"After that, I will hand you over to your enemies. They want to kill you,” announces the Lord . “I will hand over Zedekiah, the king of Judah, and his officials. I will also hand over the people in this city who live through the plague, war and hunger. All of them will be handed over to Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon. He will kill them with swords. He will show them no mercy. He will not feel sorry for them. In fact, he will not have any concern for them at all.” ’"
Jeremiah,21,8,"“Tell the people, ‘The Lord says, “I am offering you a choice. You can choose the way that leads to life. Or you can choose the way that leads to death."
Jeremiah,21,9,"Those who stay in this city will die of war, hunger or plague. But suppose some go out and give themselves up to the Babylonians attacking you. They will live. They will escape with their lives."
Jeremiah,21,10,"I have decided to do this city harm and not good,” announces the Lord . “It will be handed over to the king of Babylon. And he will destroy it with fire.” ’"
Jeremiah,21,11,"“Also speak to Judah’s royal family. Tell them, ‘Listen to the Lord ’s message."
Jeremiah,21,12,"Here is what the Lord says to you who belong to David’s royal house. “ ‘ “Every morning do what is right and fair. Save those who have been robbed. Set them free from the people who have treated them badly. If you do not, my anger will blaze out against you. It will burn like fire because of the evil things you have done. No one will be able to put it out."
Jeremiah,21,13,"Jerusalem, I am against you,” announces the Lord. “You live above this valley. You are on a high, rocky plain. And you say, ‘Who can come against us? Who can enter our place of safety?’"
Jeremiah,21,14,"But I will punish you in keeping with what you have done,” announces the Lord. “I will start a fire in your forests. It will burn down everything around you.” ’ ”"
Jeremiah,22,1,"The Lord said to Jeremiah, “Go down to the palace of the king of Judah. Announce my message there. Tell him,"
Jeremiah,22,2,"‘King of Judah, listen to the Lord ’s message. You are sitting on David’s throne. You and your officials and your people come through these gates."
Jeremiah,22,3,"The Lord says, “Do what is fair and right. Save those who have been robbed. Set them free from the people who have treated them badly. Do not do anything wrong to outsiders or widows in this place. Do not harm children whose fathers have died. Do not kill those who are not guilty of doing anything wrong."
Jeremiah,22,4,Be careful to obey these commands. Then kings who sit on David’s throne will come through the gates of this palace. They will come riding in chariots and on horses. Their officials and their people will come along with them.
Jeremiah,22,5,"But suppose you do not obey these commands,” announces the Lord . “Then I promise you that this palace will be destroyed. You can be as sure of this promise as you are sure that I live.” ’ ”"
Jeremiah,22,6,"The Lord speaks about the palace of the king of Judah. He says, “You are like the land of Gilead to me. You are like the highest mountain in Lebanon. But I will make you like a desert. You will become like towns that no one lives in."
Jeremiah,22,7,I will send destroyers against you. All of them will come with their weapons. They will cut up your fine cedar beams. They will throw them into the fire.
Jeremiah,22,8,"“People from many nations will pass by this city. They will ask one another, ‘Why has the Lord done such a thing to this great city?’"
Jeremiah,22,9,"And the answer will be, ‘This happened because of what its people have done. They have turned away from the covenant the Lord their God made with them. They have worshiped other gods. And they have served them.’ ”"
Jeremiah,22,10,"Don’t weep over dead King Josiah. Don’t be sad because he’s gone. Instead, weep bitterly over King Jehoahaz. He was forced to leave his country. He will never return. He’ll never see his own land again."
Jeremiah,22,11,"Jehoahaz became king of Judah after his father Josiah. But he has gone away from this place. That’s because the Lord says about him, “He will never return."
Jeremiah,22,12,He will die in Egypt. That is where he was taken as a prisoner. He will not see this land again.”
Jeremiah,22,13,"The Lord says, “How terrible it will be for King Jehoiakim! He builds his palace by mistreating his people. He builds its upstairs rooms with money gained by sinning. He makes his own people work for nothing. He does not pay them for what they do."
Jeremiah,22,14,"He says, ‘I will build myself a great palace. It will have large rooms upstairs.’ So he makes big windows in it. He covers its walls with cedar boards. He decorates it with red paint."
Jeremiah,22,15,"“Jehoiakim, does having more and more cedar boards make you a king? Your father Josiah had enough to eat and drink. He did what was right and fair. So everything went well with him."
Jeremiah,22,16,"He stood up for those who were poor or needy. So everything went well with him. That is what it means to know me,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,22,17,"“Jehoiakim, the only thing on your mind is to get rich by cheating others. You would even kill people who are not guilty of doing anything wrong. You would mistreat them. You would take everything they own.”"
Jeremiah,22,18,"So the Lord speaks about King Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah. He says, “His people will not mourn for him. They will not say, ‘My poor brother! My poor sister!’ They will not mourn for him. They will not say, ‘My poor master! How sad that his glory is gone!’"
Jeremiah,22,19,"In fact, he will be buried like a donkey. His body will be dragged away and thrown outside the gates of Jerusalem.”"
Jeremiah,22,20,"The Lord says, “People of Jerusalem, go up to Lebanon. Cry out for help. Let your voice be heard in the land of Bashan. Cry out from the mountains of Abarim. All those who were going to help you are crushed."
Jeremiah,22,21,"When you felt secure, I warned you. But you said, ‘I won’t listen!’ You have acted like that ever since you were young. You have not obeyed me."
Jeremiah,22,22,The wind will drive away all your shepherds. All those who were going to help you will be carried off as prisoners. Then you will be dishonored and put to shame. That will happen because you have been so sinful.
Jeremiah,22,23,Some of you live in Jerusalem in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon. You are comfortable in your cedar buildings. But you will groan when pain comes on you. It will be like the pain of a woman having a baby.
Jeremiah,22,24,"“King Jehoiachin, you are the son of Jehoiakim,” announces the Lord . “Suppose you were a ring on my right hand. And suppose the ring even had my royal mark on it. Then I would still pull you off my finger. And that is just as sure as I am alive."
Jeremiah,22,25,"I will hand you over to those who want to kill you. I will hand you over to people you are afraid of. I will give you to Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon. I will hand you over to his armies."
Jeremiah,22,26,I will throw you out into another country. I will throw your mother out. Neither of you was born in that country. But both of you will die there.
Jeremiah,22,27,You will never come back to the land you long to return to.”
Jeremiah,22,28,This man Jehoiachin is like a broken pot. Everyone hates him. No one wants him. Why will he and his children be thrown out of this land? Why will they be sent to a land they don’t know about?
Jeremiah,22,29,"Land, land, land, listen to the Lord ’s message!"
Jeremiah,22,30,"The Lord says, “Let the record say that this man did not have any children. Let it report that he did not have any success in life. None of his children will have success either. None of them will sit on David’s throne. None of them will ever rule over Judah."
Jeremiah,23,1,“How terrible it will be for the shepherds who lead my people astray!” announces the Lord . “They are destroying and scattering the sheep that belong to my flock.”
Jeremiah,23,2,"So the Lord , the God of Israel, speaks to the shepherds who take care of my people. He tells them, “You have scattered my sheep. You have driven them away. You have not taken good care of them. So I will punish you for the evil things you have done,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,23,3,“I myself will gather together those who are left alive in my flock. I will gather them out of all the countries where I have driven them. And I will bring them back to their own land. There my sheep will have many lambs. There will be many more of them.
Jeremiah,23,4,"I will place shepherds over them who will take good care of them. My sheep will not be afraid or terrified anymore. And none of them will be missing,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,23,5,"“A new day is coming,” announces the Lord. “At that time I will raise up for David’s royal line a godly Branch. He will be a King who will rule wisely. He will do what is fair and right in the land."
Jeremiah,23,6,In his days Judah will be saved. Israel will live in safety. And the Branch will be called The Lord Who Makes Us Right With Himself.
Jeremiah,23,7,"Other days are also coming,” announces the Lord . “At that time people will no longer say, ‘The Lord brought the Israelites up out of Egypt. And that’s just as sure as he is alive.’"
Jeremiah,23,8,"Instead, they will say, ‘The Lord brought the Israelites up out of the land of the north. He gathered them out of all the countries where he had forced them to go. And that’s just as sure as he is alive.’ Then they will live in their own land.”"
Jeremiah,23,9,Here is my message about the prophets. My heart is broken inside me. All my bones tremble with fear. I am like a man who is drunk. I am like a strong man who has had too much wine. That’s what the Lord ’s holy words have done to me.
Jeremiah,23,10,The land is full of people who aren’t faithful to the Lord. Now the land is under his curse. And that’s why it is thirsty for water. That’s why the desert grasslands are dry. The prophets are leading sinful lives. They don’t use their power in the right way.
Jeremiah,23,11,"“Prophets and priests alike are ungodly,” announces the Lord. “Even in my temple I find them sinning."
Jeremiah,23,12,"So their path will become slippery. They will be thrown out into darkness. There they will fall. I will bring trouble on them when the time to punish them comes,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,23,13,“Among the prophets of Samaria I saw something I can’t stand. They were prophesying in the name of Baal. They were leading my people Israel astray.
Jeremiah,23,14,I have also seen something horrible among Jerusalem’s prophets. They are not faithful to me. They are not living by the truth. They strengthen the hands of those who do evil. So not one of them turns from their sinful ways. All of them are like the people of Sodom to me. They are just like the people of Gomorrah.”
Jeremiah,23,15,"So the Lord who rules over all speaks about the prophets. He says, “I will make them eat bitter food. I will make them drink poisoned water. The prophets of Jerusalem have spread their ungodly ways all through the land.”"
Jeremiah,23,16,"The Lord who rules over all says to the people of Judah, “Do not listen to what the prophets are saying to you. They fill you with false hopes. They talk about visions that come from their own minds. What they say does not come from my mouth."
Jeremiah,23,17,"They keep speaking to those who hate me. They say, ‘The Lord says you will have peace.’ They speak to all those who do what their stubborn hearts want them to do. They tell them, ‘No harm will come to you.’"
Jeremiah,23,18,But which of them has ever stood in my courts? Have they been there to see a vision or hear my message? Who has listened and heard my message there?
Jeremiah,23,19,A storm will burst out because of my great anger. A windstorm will sweep down on the heads of sinful people.
Jeremiah,23,20,My anger will not turn back. I will accomplish everything I plan to do. In days to come you will understand it clearly.
Jeremiah,23,21,I did not send these prophets. But they have run to tell you their message anyway. I did not speak to them. But they have still prophesied.
Jeremiah,23,22,Suppose they had stood in my courts. Then they would have announced my message to my people. They would have turned my people from their evil ways. They would have turned them away from their sins.
Jeremiah,23,23,“Am I only a God who is nearby?” announces the Lord. “Am I not a God who is also far away?
Jeremiah,23,24,Who can hide in secret places so that I can’t see them?” announces the Lord. “Don’t I fill heaven and earth?” announces the Lord.
Jeremiah,23,25,"“I have heard what the prophets are saying. They prophesy lies in my name. They say, ‘I had a dream! The Lord has given me a dream!’"
Jeremiah,23,26,How long will that continue in the hearts of these prophets who tell lies? They try to get others to believe their own mistaken ideas.
Jeremiah,23,27,"They tell one another their dreams. They think that will make my people forget my name. In the same way, their people of long ago forgot my name when they worshiped Baal."
Jeremiah,23,28,"Let the prophet who has a dream describe the dream. But let the one who has my message speak it faithfully. Your prophets have given you straw to eat instead of grain,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,23,29,"“My message is like fire,” announces the Lord . “It is like a hammer that breaks a rock in pieces."
Jeremiah,23,30,"“So I am against these prophets,” announces the Lord . “I am against those who steal messages from one another. They claim that the messages come from me."
Jeremiah,23,31,"Yes,” announces the Lord . “I am against the prophets who speak their own words. But they still say, ‘Here is what the Lord says.’"
Jeremiah,23,32,"I am against prophets who talk about dreams that did not come from me,” announces the Lord . “They tell foolish lies. Their lies lead my people astray. But I did not send these prophets. I did not appoint them. They do not help my people in the least,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,23,33,"“Jeremiah, these people might ask you a question. Or a prophet or priest might do this. They might ask, ‘What message have you received from the Lord ?’ Then tell them, ‘You ask, “What message?” Here it is. “I will desert you,” announces the Lord .’"
Jeremiah,23,34,"A prophet or priest might make a claim. Or someone else might do this. He might claim, ‘This is a message from the Lord .’ Then I will punish them and their family."
Jeremiah,23,35,"Here is what each of you people keeps on saying to your friends and other Israelites. You ask, ‘What is the Lord ’s answer?’ Or you ask, ‘What has the Lord spoken?’"
Jeremiah,23,36,But you must not talk about ‘a message from the Lord ’ again. That’s because each person’s own words become their message. And so you twist the Lord ’s words. He is the living God. He is the Lord who rules over all. And he is our God.
Jeremiah,23,37,"Here is what you keep saying to a prophet. You ask, ‘What is the Lord ’s answer to you?’ Or you ask, ‘What has the Lord spoken?’"
Jeremiah,23,38,"You claim, ‘This is a message from the Lord .’ But here is what the Lord says. ‘You used the words, “This is a message from the Lord .” But I told you that you must not claim, “This is a message from the Lord .” ’"
Jeremiah,23,39,So you can be sure I will forget you. I will throw you out of my sight. I will also destroy the city I gave you and your people of long ago.
Jeremiah,23,40,I will bring on you shame that will last forever. It will never be forgotten.”
Jeremiah,24,1,"King Jehoiachin was forced to leave Jerusalem. He was the son of Jehoiakim. Jehoiachin was taken to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon. The officials and all the skilled workers were forced to leave with him. After they left, the Lord showed me two baskets of figs. They were in front of his temple."
Jeremiah,24,2,"One basket had very good figs in it. They were like figs that ripen early. The other basket had very bad figs in it. In fact, they were so bad they couldn’t even be eaten."
Jeremiah,24,3,"Then the Lord asked me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?” “Figs,” I answered. “The good ones are very good. But the others are so bad they can’t be eaten.”"
Jeremiah,24,4,"Then a message from the Lord came to me. The Lord said,"
Jeremiah,24,5,"“I am the Lord , the God of Israel. I say, ‘I consider the people who were forced to leave Judah to be like these good figs. I sent them away from this place. I forced them to go to Babylon."
Jeremiah,24,6,My eyes will watch over them. I will be good to them. And I will bring them back to this land. I will build them up. I will not tear them down. I will plant them. I will not pull them up by the roots.
Jeremiah,24,7,I will change their hearts. Then they will know that I am the Lord . They will be my people. And I will be their God. They will return to me with all their heart.
Jeremiah,24,8,"“ ‘But there are also bad figs. In fact, they are so bad they can’t be eaten,’ says the Lord . ‘Zedekiah, the king of Judah, is like these bad figs. So are his officials and the people of Jerusalem who are still left alive. I will punish them whether they remain in this land or live in Egypt."
Jeremiah,24,9,"I will make all the kingdoms on earth displeased with them. In fact, they will hate them a great deal. They will shake their heads at them. They will curse them and make fun of them. All this will happen no matter where I force them to go."
Jeremiah,24,10,"I will send war, hunger and plague against them. They will be destroyed from the land I gave them and their people of long ago.’ ”"
Jeremiah,25,1,A message from the Lord about all the people of Judah came to Jeremiah. It came in the fourth year that Jehoiakim was the king of Judah. It was the first year that Nebuchadnezzar was the king of Babylon. Jehoiakim was the son of Josiah.
Jeremiah,25,2,"Jeremiah, the Lord ’s prophet, spoke to all the people of Judah and Jerusalem. He said,"
Jeremiah,25,3,“For 23 years the Lord ’s messages have been coming to me. They began to come in the 13th year that Josiah was king of Judah. He was the son of Amon. The Lord ’s messages still come to me today. I’ve spoken to you people again and again. But you haven’t listened to me.
Jeremiah,25,4,“The Lord has sent all his servants the prophets to you. They’ve come to you again and again. But you haven’t listened. You haven’t paid any attention to them.
Jeremiah,25,5,"They said, ‘Each of you must turn from your evil ways and practices. Then you can stay in the land forever. It’s the land the Lord gave you and your people of long ago."
Jeremiah,25,6,Don’t follow other gods. Don’t serve them or worship them. Don’t make the Lord angry with the gods your own hands have made. Then he won’t harm you.’
Jeremiah,25,7,"“ ‘But you did not listen to me,’ announces the Lord . ‘You have made me very angry with the gods your hands have made. And you have brought harm on yourselves.’"
Jeremiah,25,8,"“The Lord who rules over all says, ‘You have not listened to my words."
Jeremiah,25,9,"So I will send for all the nations in the north. And I will send for my servant Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon,’ announces the Lord . ‘I will bring all of them against this land and against you who live here. They will march out against all the nations that are around this land. I will set apart Judah and the nations around it in a special way to be destroyed. People will be shocked because of them. And they will make fun of them. Those nations will be destroyed forever."
Jeremiah,25,10,I will put an end to the sounds of joy and gladness. I will put an end to the voices of brides and grooms. The sound of grinding millstones will not be heard anymore. And lamps will not be lit anymore.
Jeremiah,25,11,This whole country will become dry and empty. And these nations will serve the king of Babylon for 70 years.
Jeremiah,25,12,"“ ‘But I will punish that king and his nation because they are guilty. I will do this when the 70 years are over,’ announces the Lord . ‘I will make that land a desert forever."
Jeremiah,25,13,I have spoken against that land. And I will make all these things happen to it. Everything will happen that is written in this book. And I will make everything Jeremiah prophesied against all the nations come true.
Jeremiah,25,14,The people of Babylon will become slaves of many other nations and great kings. I will pay them back for what they have done.’ ”
Jeremiah,25,15,"The Lord is the God of Israel. He said to me, “Take this cup from my hand. It is filled with the wine of my great anger. Make all the nations to which I send you drink it."
Jeremiah,25,16,"When they drink it, they will not even be able to walk straight. It will drive them out of their minds. I am going to send war against them.”"
Jeremiah,25,17,So I took the cup from the Lord ’s hand. I made all the nations to which he sent me drink from it.
Jeremiah,25,18,He sent me to Judah’s kings and officials. He told me to go to Jerusalem and the towns of Judah. He wanted me to tell them they would be destroyed. Then people would be shocked because of them. They would make fun of them. They would use their name in a curse. And that’s how things still are today.
Jeremiah,25,19,"Here is a list of the other kings and nations he sent me to. Pharaoh, the king of Egypt his attendants, his officials, all his people"
Jeremiah,25,20,"all the people from other lands who lived there all the kings of Uz the Philistine kings of Ashkelon, Gaza and Ekron the Philistines still living in Ashdod"
Jeremiah,25,21,"Edom, Moab, Ammon"
Jeremiah,25,22,all the kings of Tyre and Sidon the kings of the islands and other lands along the Mediterranean Sea
Jeremiah,25,23,"Dedan, Teman, Buz all the other places far away in the east"
Jeremiah,25,24,all the kings of Arabia all the other kings of people who live in the desert
Jeremiah,25,25,"all the kings of Zimri, Elam and Media"
Jeremiah,25,26,"all the kings in the north, near and far So he sent me to all the kingdoms on the face of the earth, one after the other. They will all drink from the cup of the Lord ’s anger. After they drink, the king of Babylon will drink from it too."
Jeremiah,25,27,"The Lord says, “Tell them, ‘The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel. He says, “Drink from this cup. Get drunk and throw up. Fall down and do not get up again. I am going to send war against you.” ’"
Jeremiah,25,28,"But they might refuse to take the cup from your hand. They might not want to drink from it. Then tell them, ‘The Lord who rules over all says, “You must drink from it!"
Jeremiah,25,29,"I am beginning to bring trouble on the city where I have put my Name. You might think you will not be punished. But you will certainly be punished. I am sending war against everyone who lives on earth,” announces the Lord who rules over all.’"
Jeremiah,25,30,"“Jeremiah, prophesy against them. Tell them, “ ‘The Lord will roar from heaven like a lion. His voice will sound like thunder from his holy temple there. He will roar loudly against his land. He will shout like those who stomp on grapes in winepresses. He will shout against everyone who lives on earth."
Jeremiah,25,31,"The noise of battle will be heard from one end of the earth to the other. That’s because the Lord will bring charges against the nations. He will judge every human being. He will kill sinful people with his sword,’ ” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,25,32,"The Lord who rules over all says, “Look! Horrible trouble is spreading from one nation to another. A mighty storm is rising. It is coming from a place that is very far away.”"
Jeremiah,25,33,"At that time those the Lord kills will be lying around everywhere. They will be found from one end of the earth to the other. No one will mourn for them. Their dead bodies will not be gathered up or buried. Instead, they will be like human waste lying there on the ground."
Jeremiah,25,34,"Weep and cry, you shepherds. Roll in the dust, you leaders of the flock. Your time to be killed has come. You will fall like the best of the rams."
Jeremiah,25,35,The shepherds won’t have any place to run to. The leaders of the flock won’t be able to escape.
Jeremiah,25,36,Listen to the cries of the shepherds. Hear the weeping of the leaders of the flock. The Lord is destroying their grasslands.
Jeremiah,25,37,Their peaceful meadows will be completely destroyed because of the Lord ’s great anger.
Jeremiah,25,38,Like a lion he will leave his den. The land of those leaders will become a desert. That’s because the sword of the Lord brings great harm. His anger will burn against them.
Jeremiah,26,1,A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah. It was shortly after Jehoiakim became king of Judah. He was the son of Josiah.
Jeremiah,26,2,"The Lord said to Jeremiah, “Stand in the courtyard of my house. Speak to the people of the towns in Judah. Speak to all those who come to worship in my house. Tell them everything I command you. Do not leave out a single word."
Jeremiah,26,3,Perhaps they will listen. Maybe they will turn from their evil ways. Then I will not do what I said I would. I will not bring trouble on them. I had planned to punish them because of the evil things they had done.
Jeremiah,26,4,"Tell them, ‘The Lord says, “Listen to me. Obey my law that I gave you."
Jeremiah,26,5,And listen to the words my servants the prophets are speaking. I have sent them to you again and again. But you have not listened to them.
Jeremiah,26,6,So I will make this house like Shiloh. All the nations on earth will use the name of this city in a curse.” ’ ”
Jeremiah,26,7,"Jeremiah spoke these words in the Lord ’s house. The priests, the prophets and all the people heard him."
Jeremiah,26,8,"Jeremiah finished telling all the people everything the Lord had commanded him to say. But as soon as he did, the priests, the prophets and all the people grabbed him. They said, “You must die!"
Jeremiah,26,9,Why do you prophesy these things in the Lord ’s name? Why do you say that this house will become like Shiloh? Why do you say that this city will be empty and deserted?” And all the people crowded around Jeremiah in the Lord ’s house.
Jeremiah,26,10,The officials of Judah heard what had happened. So they went up from the royal palace to the Lord ’s house. There they took their places at the entrance of the New Gate.
Jeremiah,26,11,"Then the priests and prophets spoke to the officials and all the people. They said, “This man should be sentenced to death. He has prophesied against this city. You have heard it with your own ears!”"
Jeremiah,26,12,"Then Jeremiah spoke to all the officials and people. He said, “The Lord sent me to prophesy against this house and this city. He told me to say everything you have heard."
Jeremiah,26,13,So change the way you live and act. Obey the Lord your God. Then he won’t do what he said he would. He won’t bring on you the trouble he said he would bring.
Jeremiah,26,14,"As for me, I’m in your hands. Do to me what you think is good and right."
Jeremiah,26,15,"But you can be sure of one thing. If you put me to death, you will be held responsible for spilling my blood. And I haven’t even done anything wrong. You will bring guilt on yourselves and this city and those who live in it. The Lord has sent me to you. He wanted me to say all these things so you could hear them. And that’s the truth.”"
Jeremiah,26,16,"Then the officials and all the people spoke to the priests and prophets. They said, “This man shouldn’t be sentenced to death! He has spoken to us in the name of the Lord our God.”"
Jeremiah,26,17,"Some of the elders of the land stepped forward. They spoke to the whole community gathered there. They said,"
Jeremiah,26,18,"“Micah from Moresheth prophesied. It was during the time Hezekiah was king over Judah. Micah spoke to all the people of Judah. He told them, ‘The Lord who rules over all says, “ ‘ “Zion will be plowed up like a field. Jerusalem will be turned into a pile of trash. The temple hill will be covered with bushes and weeds.” ’( Micah 3:12)"
Jeremiah,26,19,Did King Hezekiah or anyone else in Judah put Micah to death? Hezekiah had respect for the Lord and tried to please him. And the Lord didn’t judge Jerusalem as he said he would. He didn’t bring on it the trouble he said he would bring. But we are about to bring horrible trouble on ourselves!”
Jeremiah,26,20,Uriah was another man who prophesied in the name of the Lord . He was from Kiriath Jearim. He was the son of Shemaiah. Uriah prophesied against this city and this land. He said the same things Jeremiah did.
Jeremiah,26,21,King Jehoiakim and all his officers and officials heard Uriah’s words. So the king decided to put him to death. But Uriah heard about it. He was afraid. And he ran away to Egypt.
Jeremiah,26,22,So King Jehoiakim sent Elnathan to Egypt. He also sent some other men along with him. Elnathan was the son of Akbor.
Jeremiah,26,23,Those men brought Uriah out of Egypt. They took him to King Jehoiakim. Then the king had Uriah struck down with a sword. He had Uriah’s body thrown into one of the graves of the ordinary people.
Jeremiah,26,24,"In spite of that, Ahikam stood up for Jeremiah. Ahikam was the son of Shaphan. Because of Ahikam, Jeremiah wasn’t handed over to the people to be put to death."
Jeremiah,27,1,A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah. It was shortly after Zedekiah became king of Judah. He was the son of Josiah.
Jeremiah,27,2,"The Lord said, “Make a yoke out of ropes and wooden boards. Put it on your neck."
Jeremiah,27,3,"Then write down a message for the kings of Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre and Sidon. Give it to their messengers who have come to Jerusalem. They have come to see Zedekiah, the king of Judah."
Jeremiah,27,4,"Give them a message for the kings who sent them. It should say, ‘The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel. He says, “Here is what I want you to tell your masters."
Jeremiah,27,5,I reached out my great and powerful arm. I made the earth. I made its people and animals. And I can give the earth to anyone I please.
Jeremiah,27,6,Now I will hand over all your countries to my servant Nebuchadnezzar. He is the king of Babylon. I will put even the wild animals under his control.
Jeremiah,27,7,"All the nations will serve him and his son and grandson. After that, I will judge his land. Then many nations and great kings will make him serve them."
Jeremiah,27,8,"“ ‘ “But suppose any nation or kingdom will not serve Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon. And suppose it refuses to put its neck under his yoke. Then I will punish that nation with war, hunger and plague,” announces the Lord . “I will punish it until his powerful hand destroys it."
Jeremiah,27,9,"So do not listen to your prophets. Do not listen to those who claim to have secret knowledge. Do not listen to those who try to explain your dreams. Do not listen to those who get messages from people who have died. Do not listen to those who practice evil magic. All of them will tell you, ‘You won’t serve the king of Babylon.’"
Jeremiah,27,10,"But they prophesy lies to you. If you listen to them, you will be removed far away from your lands. I will drive you away from them. And you will die."
Jeremiah,27,11,"But suppose any nation will put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon. And suppose it serves him. Then I will let that nation remain in its own land. I will let its people plow the land and live there,” ’ ” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,27,12,"I gave the same message to Zedekiah, the king of Judah. I said, “Put your neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon. Obey him. Serve his people. Then you will live."
Jeremiah,27,13,"Why should you and your people die? Why should you die of war, hunger and plague? That’s what the Lord said would happen to any nation that won’t serve the king of Babylon."
Jeremiah,27,14,"Don’t listen to the words of the prophets who say to you, ‘You won’t serve the king of Babylon.’ They are prophesying lies to you."
Jeremiah,27,15,"‘I have not sent them,’ announces the Lord . ‘They are prophesying lies in my name. So I will drive you away from your land. And you will die. So will the prophets who prophesy to you.’ ”"
Jeremiah,27,16,"Then I spoke to the priests and all these people. I said, “The Lord says, ‘Do not listen to the prophets who speak to you. They say, “Very soon the objects from the Lord ’s house will be brought back from Babylon.” Those prophets are prophesying lies to you."
Jeremiah,27,17,Do not listen to them. Serve the king of Babylon. Then you will live. Why should this city be destroyed?
Jeremiah,27,18,"If they are prophets and have received a message from me, let them pray to me. I am the Lord who rules over all. Those prophets should pray that what is still in Jerusalem will remain here. They should pray that the objects in my house and the king’s palace will not be taken to Babylon."
Jeremiah,27,19,I am the Lord who rules over all. Do you know what these objects are? They include the two pillars in front of the temple. They include the huge bronze bowl. They include the bronze stands that can be moved around. And they include the other things left in this city.
Jeremiah,27,20,"Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, did not take these things away at first. That was when he took King Jehoiachin from Jerusalem to Babylon. Jehoiachin is the son of Jehoiakim. Nebuchadnezzar also took all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem along with Jehoiachin."
Jeremiah,27,21,"I am the Lord who rules over all. I am the God of Israel. Here is what will happen to the things that are left in my house, the king’s palace and Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,27,22,"They will be taken to Babylon. They will remain there until the day I come for them,’ announces the Lord . ‘Then I will bring them back. I will return them to this place.’ ”"
Jeremiah,28,1,"The false prophet Hananiah spoke to me, Jeremiah, in the Lord ’s house. Hananiah was from Gibeon. He was the son of Azzur. It was shortly after Zedekiah became king of Judah. It was in the fifth month of his fourth year. In front of the priests and all the people Hananiah spoke to me. He said,"
Jeremiah,28,2,"“The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel. He says, ‘I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon."
Jeremiah,28,3,"Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, removed all the objects that belong to my house. He took them to Babylon. Before two years are over, I will bring them back to this place."
Jeremiah,28,4,"I will also bring King Jehoiachin back. He is the son of Jehoiakim. And I will bring back all the others who were taken from Judah to Babylon,’ announces the Lord . ‘I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.’ ”"
Jeremiah,28,5,Then Jeremiah the prophet replied to the false prophet Hananiah. Jeremiah spoke to him in front of the priests and all the people. They were standing in the Lord ’s house.
Jeremiah,28,6,"Jeremiah said, “Amen, Hananiah! May the Lord do those things! May he make the words you have prophesied come true. May he bring back from Babylon the objects that belong to the Lord ’s house. May he bring back to this place all the people who were taken away."
Jeremiah,28,7,But listen to what I have to say. I want you and all the people to hear it.
Jeremiah,28,8,"There have been prophets long before you and I were ever born. They have prophesied against many countries and great kingdoms. They have spoken about war, trouble and plague."
Jeremiah,28,9,But what if a prophet says peace will come? And suppose peace really does come? Only then will he be recognized as a prophet truly sent by the Lord .”
Jeremiah,28,10,The false prophet Hananiah took the yoke off the neck of Jeremiah the prophet. Then Hananiah broke the yoke.
Jeremiah,28,11,"In front of all the people he said, “The Lord says, ‘In the same way, I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon. Before two years are over, I will remove it from the necks of all the nations.’ ” When Jeremiah the prophet heard this, he went on his way."
Jeremiah,28,12,"A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah. It was after the false prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke off Jeremiah’s neck. The message said,"
Jeremiah,28,13,"“Go. Tell Hananiah, ‘The Lord says, “You have broken a wooden yoke. But in its place you will get an iron yoke.”"
Jeremiah,28,14,"The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel. He says, “I will put an iron yoke on the necks of all these nations. I will make them serve Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon. So they will serve him. I will even give him control over the wild animals.” ’ ”"
Jeremiah,28,15,"Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke to the false prophet Hananiah. Jeremiah said, “Listen, Hananiah! The Lord hasn’t sent you. But you have tricked these people. Now they trust in lies."
Jeremiah,28,16,"So the Lord says, ‘I am about to remove you from the face of the earth. Before this year is over, you will die. You have taught the people to turn against me.’ ”"
Jeremiah,28,17,"In the seventh month of that very year, the false prophet Hananiah died."
Jeremiah,29,1,Jeremiah the prophet sent a letter from Jerusalem to Babylon. It was for the Jewish elders still alive there. It was also for the priests and prophets in Babylon. And it was for all the other people Nebuchadnezzar had taken from Jerusalem to Babylon.
Jeremiah,29,2,It was sent to them after King Jehoiachin had been forced to leave Jerusalem. His mother and the court officials were taken with him. The leaders of Judah and Jerusalem had been forced to go to Babylon. All the skilled workers had also been forced to go.
Jeremiah,29,3,"Jeremiah gave the letter to Elasah and Gemariah. Elasah was the son of Shaphan. Gemariah was the son of Hilkiah. Zedekiah, the king of Judah, had sent Elasah and Gemariah to King Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon. Here is what the letter said."
Jeremiah,29,4,"The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel. He speaks to all those he forced to go from Jerusalem to Babylon. He says,"
Jeremiah,29,5,“Build houses and make your homes there. Plant gardens and eat what they produce.
Jeremiah,29,6,Get married. Have sons and daughters. Find wives for your sons. Give your daughters to be married. Then they too can have sons and daughters. Let there be many more of you and not fewer.
Jeremiah,29,7,"Also work for the success of the city I have sent you to. Pray to the Lord for that city. If it succeeds, you too will enjoy success.”"
Jeremiah,29,8,"The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel. He says, “Do not let the prophets trick you. Do not be fooled by those who claim to have secret knowledge. Do not listen to people who try to explain their dreams to you."
Jeremiah,29,9,"All of them are prophesying lies to you in my name. I have not sent them,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,29,10,"The Lord says, “You will be forced to live in Babylon for 70 years. After they are over, I will come to you. My good promise to you will come true. I will bring you back home."
Jeremiah,29,11,"I know the plans I have for you,” announces the Lord . “I want you to enjoy success. I do not plan to harm you. I will give you hope for the years to come."
Jeremiah,29,12,Then you will call out to me. You will come and pray to me. And I will listen to you.
Jeremiah,29,13,"When you look for me with all your heart, you will find me."
Jeremiah,29,14,"I will be found by you,” announces the Lord . “And I will bring you back from where you were taken as prisoners. I will gather you from all the nations. I will gather you from the places where I have forced you to go,” announces the Lord . “I will bring you back to the place I sent you away from.”"
Jeremiah,29,15,"You might say, “The Lord has given us prophets in Babylon.”"
Jeremiah,29,16,But here is what the Lord says about the king who now sits on David’s throne. He also says it about all the people who remain in this city. And he says it about all those who did not go with you to Babylon.
Jeremiah,29,17,"The Lord who rules over all says, “I will send war, hunger and plague against them. I will make them like bad figs. They are so bad they can’t be eaten."
Jeremiah,29,18,"I will hunt them down with war, hunger and plague. I will make all the kingdoms on earth displeased with them. They will use their name in a curse. All the nations where I drive them will be shocked at them. They will make fun of them. And they will bring shame on them."
Jeremiah,29,19,"That’s because they have not listened to my words,” announces the Lord . “I sent messages to them again and again. I sent them through my servants the prophets. And you who were taken to Babylon have not listened either,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,29,20,"So listen to the Lord ’s message. Listen, all you whom he has sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon."
Jeremiah,29,21,"The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel. He speaks about Ahab and Zedekiah. Ahab is the son of Kolaiah. Zedekiah is the son of Maaseiah. They are prophesying lies to you in my name. The Lord says about Ahab and Zedekiah, “I will hand them over to Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon. He will put them to death. You will see it with your own eyes."
Jeremiah,29,22,"Because of what happens to them, people will use their names when they curse someone. All those who have been taken from Judah to Babylon will use their names in that way. They will say, ‘May the Lord treat you like Zedekiah and Ahab. The king of Babylon burned them in the fire.’"
Jeremiah,29,23,"That will happen because they have done awful things in Israel. They have committed adultery with their neighbors’ wives. They have spoken lies in my name. I did not give them the authority to speak those things. I know what they have done. And I am a witness to it,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,29,24,"Tell Shemaiah, the Nehelamite,"
Jeremiah,29,25,"“The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel. He says, ‘You sent letters in your own name to all the people in Jerusalem. You also sent them to Zephaniah the priest. He is the son of Maaseiah. And you sent them to all the other priests. You said to Zephaniah,"
Jeremiah,29,26,“The Lord has appointed you priest in place of Jehoiada. He has put you in charge of the Lord ’s house. You are supposed to arrest any crazy person who claims to be a prophet. You should put him in prison. You should put iron bands around his neck.
Jeremiah,29,27,So why haven’t you punished Jeremiah from Anathoth? He claims to be a prophet among you.
Jeremiah,29,28,"He has sent a message to us in Babylon. It says, ‘You will be there a long time. So build houses and make your homes there. Plant gardens and eat what they produce.’ ” ’ ”"
Jeremiah,29,29,But Zephaniah the priest read the letter to me.
Jeremiah,29,30,"Then a message from the Lord came to me. The Lord said,"
Jeremiah,29,31,"“Send a message to all the people who were taken away. Tell them, ‘The Lord speaks about Shemaiah, the Nehelamite. He says, “Shemaiah has prophesied to you. But I did not send him. He has made you trust in lies."
Jeremiah,29,32,"So I say, ‘I will certainly punish Shemaiah, the Nehelamite. I will also punish his children after him. He will not have any children left among these people. I will do good things for my people. But he will not see them,’ ” ’ ” announces the Lord . “ ‘ “ ‘That’s because he has taught people to turn against me.’ ” ’ ”"
Jeremiah,30,1,"A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah. The Lord said,"
Jeremiah,30,2,"“I am the Lord . I am the God of Israel. I say, ‘Write in a book all the words I have spoken to you."
Jeremiah,30,3,"A new day is coming,’ ” announces the Lord . “ ‘At that time I will bring my people Israel and Judah back from where they have been taken as prisoners. I will bring them back to this land. I gave it to their people of long ago to have as their own,’ ” says the Lord."
Jeremiah,30,4,"Here are the words the Lord spoke about Israel and Judah. He said,"
Jeremiah,30,5,"“I am the Lord . I say, “ ‘Cries of fear are heard. There is terror. There isn’t any peace."
Jeremiah,30,6,Ask and see. Can a man give birth to children? Then why do I see every strong man with his hands on his stomach? Each of them is acting like a woman having a baby. Every face is as pale as death.
Jeremiah,30,7,How awful that day will be! No other day will be like it. It will be a time of trouble for the people of Jacob. But they will be saved out of it.
Jeremiah,30,8,"“ ‘At that time I will break the yoke off their necks,’ announces the Lord who rules over all. ‘I will tear off the ropes that hold them. People from other lands will not make them slaves anymore."
Jeremiah,30,9,"Instead, they will serve me. And they will serve David their king. I will raise him up for them. I am the Lord their God."
Jeremiah,30,10,"“ ‘People of Jacob, do not be afraid. You are my servant. Israel, do not be terrified,’ ” announces the Lord. “ ‘You can be sure that I will save you. I will bring you out of a place far away. I will bring your children back from the land where they were taken. Your people will have peace and security again. And no one will make them afraid."
Jeremiah,30,11,"I am with you. I will save you,’ ” announces the Lord. “ ‘I will completely destroy all the nations among which I scatter you. But I will not completely destroy you. I will correct you. But I will be fair. I will not let you go without any punishment.’ ”"
Jeremiah,30,12,"The Lord says, “Your wound can’t be cured. Your pain can’t be healed."
Jeremiah,30,13,No one will stand up for you. There isn’t any medicine for your sore. There isn’t any healing for you.
Jeremiah,30,14,All those who were going to help you have forgotten you. They do not care about you. I have struck you as if I were your enemy. I have punished you as if I were very mean. That is because your guilt is so great. You have sinned so much.
Jeremiah,30,15,Why do you cry out about your wound? Your pain can’t be healed. Your guilt is very great. And you have committed many sins. That is why I have done all these things to you.
Jeremiah,30,16,“But everyone who destroys you will be destroyed. All your enemies will be forced to leave their countries. Those who steal from you will be stolen from. I will take the belongings of those who take things from you.
Jeremiah,30,17,"But I will make you healthy again. I will heal your wounds,” announces the Lord. “That’s because you have been thrown out. You are called Zion, the one no one cares about.”"
Jeremiah,30,18,"The Lord says, “I will bless Jacob’s people with great success again. I will show tender love to Israel. Jerusalem will be rebuilt where it was destroyed. The palace will stand in its proper place."
Jeremiah,30,19,From those places the songs of people giving thanks will be heard. The sound of great joy will come from there. I will cause there to be more of my people. There will not be fewer of them. I will bring them honor. People will have respect for them.
Jeremiah,30,20,Things will be as they used to be for Jacob’s people. I will make their community firm and secure. I will punish everyone who treats them badly.
Jeremiah,30,21,"Their leader will be one of their own people. Their ruler will rise up from among them. I will bring him near. And he will come close to me. He will commit himself to serve me,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,30,22,“So you will be my people. And I will be your God.”
Jeremiah,30,23,A storm will burst out because of the Lord ’s great anger. A strong wind will sweep down on the heads of evil people.
Jeremiah,30,24,The Lord ’s great anger won’t turn back. He will accomplish everything his heart plans to do. In days to come you will understand this.
Jeremiah,31,1,"“At that time I will be the God of all the families of Israel,” announces the Lord . “And they will be my people.”"
Jeremiah,31,2,"The Lord says, “Some of my people will live through everything their enemies do to them. They will find help in the desert. I will come to give peace and rest to Israel.”"
Jeremiah,31,3,"The Lord appeared to us in the past. He said, “I have loved you with a love that lasts forever. I have kept on loving you with a kindness that never fails."
Jeremiah,31,4,"I will build you up again. Nation of Israel, you will be rebuilt. Once again you will use your tambourines to celebrate. You will go out and dance with joy."
Jeremiah,31,5,Once again you will plant vineyards on the hills of Samaria. Farmers will plant them. They will enjoy their fruit.
Jeremiah,31,6,"There will be a day when those on guard duty will cry out. They will stand on the hills of Ephraim. And they will shout, ‘Come! Let’s go up to Zion. Let’s go up to where the Lord our God is.’ ”"
Jeremiah,31,7,"The Lord says, “Sing for joy because the people of Jacob are blessed. Shout because the Lord has made them the greatest nation. Make your praises heard. Say, ‘ Lord , save your people. Save the people who are left alive in Israel.’"
Jeremiah,31,8,I will bring them from the land of the north. I will gather them from one end of the earth to the other. Even those who are blind and those who can’t walk will be among them. Pregnant women and women having their babies will be among them also. Many of them will return.
Jeremiah,31,9,Their eyes will be filled with tears as they come. They will pray as I bring them back. I will lead them beside streams of water. I will lead them on a level path where they will not trip or fall. I am Israel’s father. And Ephraim is my oldest son.
Jeremiah,31,10,"“Listen to my message, you nations. Announce it on shores far away. Say, ‘He who scattered Israel will gather them. He will watch over his flock like a shepherd.’"
Jeremiah,31,11,I will set the people of Jacob free. I will save them from those who are stronger than they are.
Jeremiah,31,12,"They will come and shout for joy on Mount Zion. They will be joyful because of everything I give them. I give them grain, olive oil and fresh wine. I give them the young animals in their flocks and herds. Israel will be like a garden that has plenty of water. And they will not be sad anymore."
Jeremiah,31,13,"Then young women will dance and be glad. And so will the men, young and old alike. I will turn their mourning into gladness. I will comfort them. And I will give them joy instead of sorrow."
Jeremiah,31,14,"I will satisfy the priests. I will give them more than enough. And my people will be filled with the good things I give them,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,31,15,"The Lord says, “A voice is heard in Ramah. It is the sound of weeping and deep sadness. Rachel is weeping for her children. She refuses to be comforted, because they are gone.”"
Jeremiah,31,16,"The Lord says, “Do not weep anymore. Do not let tears fall from your eyes. I will reward you for your work,” announces the Lord. “Your children will return from the land of the enemy."
Jeremiah,31,17,"So there is hope for your children,” announces the Lord. “Your children will return to their own land."
Jeremiah,31,18,"“I have heard the groans of Ephraim’s people. They say, ‘You corrected us like a calf you were training. And we have been trained. Bring us back to you, and we will come back. You are the Lord our God."
Jeremiah,31,19,"After we wandered away from you, we turned away from our sins. After we learned our lesson, we beat our chests in sorrow. We were full of shame. What we did when we were young brought dishonor on us.’"
Jeremiah,31,20,"Aren’t the people of Ephraim my dear children? Aren’t they the children I take delight in? I often speak against them. But I still remember them. So my heart longs for them. I love them with a tender love,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,31,21,"The Lord says, “Put up road signs. Set up stones to show the way. Look carefully for the highway. Look for the road you will take. Return, people of Israel. Return to your towns."
Jeremiah,31,22,"How long will you wander, my people Israel, who are not faithful to me? I will create a new thing on earth. The woman will return to the man.”"
Jeremiah,31,23,"The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel. He says, “I will bring them back from the place where they were taken. Here is what the people in Judah and its towns will say once again. ‘May the Lord bless you, you successful city. Sacred mountain, may he bless you.’"
Jeremiah,31,24,People will live together in Judah and all its towns. Farmers and shepherds will live there.
Jeremiah,31,25,I will give rest to those who are tired. I will satisfy those who are weak.”
Jeremiah,31,26,"When I heard this, I woke up and looked around. My sleep had been pleasant to me."
Jeremiah,31,27,Here is what the Lord announces. “The days are coming when I will plant the kingdoms of Israel and Judah again. I will plant them with children and young animals.
Jeremiah,31,28,"I watched over Israel and Judah to pull them up by the roots. I tore them down. I crushed them. I destroyed them. I brought horrible trouble on them. But now I will watch over them to build them up and plant them,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,31,29,"“In those days people will no longer say, “ ‘The parents have eaten sour grapes. But the children have a bitter taste in their mouths.’"
Jeremiah,31,30,"Instead, everyone will die for their own sin. The one who eats sour grapes will taste how bitter they are."
Jeremiah,31,31,"“The days are coming,” announces the Lord. “I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel. I will also make it with the people of Judah."
Jeremiah,31,32,"It will not be like the covenant I made with their people of long ago. That was when I took them by the hand. I led them out of Egypt. But they broke my covenant. They did it even though I was like a husband to them,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,31,33,"“This is the covenant I will make with Israel after that time,” announces the Lord. “I will put my law in their minds. I will write it on their hearts. I will be their God. And they will be my people."
Jeremiah,31,34,"They will not need to teach their neighbor anymore. And they will not need to teach one another anymore. They will not need to say, ‘Know the Lord .’ That’s because everyone will know me. From the least important of them to the most important, all of them will know me,” announces the Lord. “I will forgive their evil ways. I will not remember their sins anymore.”"
Jeremiah,31,35,The Lord speaks. He makes the sun shine by day. He orders the moon and stars to shine at night. He stirs up the ocean. He makes its waves roar. His name is the Lord Who Rules Over All.
Jeremiah,31,36,"“Suppose my orders for creation disappear from my sight,” announces the Lord. “Only then will the people of Israel stop being a nation in my sight.”"
Jeremiah,31,37,"The Lord says, “Suppose the sky above could be measured. Suppose the foundations of the earth below could be completely discovered. Only then would I turn away the people of Israel. Even though they have committed many sins, I will still accept them,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,31,38,"“The days are coming,” announces the Lord . “At that time Jerusalem will be rebuilt for me. It will be rebuilt from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate."
Jeremiah,31,39,The measuring line will reach out from there. It will go straight to the hill of Gareb. Then it will turn and reach as far as Goah.
Jeremiah,31,40,There is a valley where dead bodies and ashes are thrown. That whole valley will be holy to me. The side of the Kidron Valley east of the city will be holy to me. It will be holy all the way to the corner of the Horse Gate. The city will never again be pulled up by the roots. It will never be destroyed.”
Jeremiah,32,1,A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah. It came in the 10th year that Zedekiah was king of Judah. It was in the 18th year of the rule of Nebuchadnezzar.
Jeremiah,32,2,The armies of the king of Babylon were getting ready to attack Jerusalem. Jeremiah the prophet was being held as a prisoner. He was kept in the courtyard of the guard. It was part of Judah’s royal palace.
Jeremiah,32,3,"Zedekiah, the king of Judah, had made Jeremiah a prisoner there. Zedekiah had said to him, “Why do you prophesy as you do? You say, ‘The Lord says, “I am about to hand over this city to the king of Babylon. He will capture it."
Jeremiah,32,4,"Zedekiah, the king of Judah, will not escape from the powerful hands of the armies of Babylon. He will certainly be handed over to the king of Babylon. Zedekiah will speak with him face to face. He will see him with his own eyes."
Jeremiah,32,5,"Nebuchadnezzar will take Zedekiah to Babylon. Zedekiah will remain there until I deal with him,” announces the Lord . “Suppose you fight against the armies of Babylon. If you do, you will not succeed.” ’ ”"
Jeremiah,32,6,"Jeremiah said, “A message from the Lord came to me. The Lord said,"
Jeremiah,32,7,"‘Hanamel is going to come to you. He is the son of your uncle Shallum. Hanamel will say, “Buy my field at Anathoth. You are my closest relative. So it’s your right and duty to buy it.” ’"
Jeremiah,32,8,"“Then my cousin Hanamel came to me. I was in the courtyard of the guard. It happened just as the Lord had said it would. Hanamel said, ‘Buy my field at Anathoth. It is in the territory of Benjamin. It is your right to buy it and own it. So buy it for yourself.’ “I knew that this was the Lord ’s message."
Jeremiah,32,9,So I bought the field at Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel. I weighed out seven ounces of silver for him.
Jeremiah,32,10,I signed and sealed the deed of purchase. I had some people witness everything. And I weighed out the silver on the scales.
Jeremiah,32,11,There were two copies of the deed. One was sealed and the other wasn’t. The deed included the terms and conditions of the sale.
Jeremiah,32,12,I gave Baruch the copies of the deed. My cousin Hanamel saw me do this. The witnesses who had signed the deed were there too. So were all the Jews who were sitting in the courtyard of the guard. Baruch was the son of Neriah. Neriah was the son of Mahseiah.
Jeremiah,32,13,"“I gave Baruch directions in front of all of them. I said,"
Jeremiah,32,14,"‘The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel. He says, “Take this deed of purchase. Take the sealed and unsealed copies. Put them in a clay jar. Then they will last a long time.”"
Jeremiah,32,15,"The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel. He says, “Houses, fields and vineyards will again be bought in this land.” ’"
Jeremiah,32,16,"“I gave the deed of purchase to Baruch, the son of Neriah. Then I prayed to the Lord . I said,"
Jeremiah,32,17,"“ ‘ Lord and King, you have reached out your great and powerful arm. You have made the heavens and the earth. Nothing is too hard for you."
Jeremiah,32,18,"You show your love to thousands of people. But you cause the sins of parents to affect even their children. Great and powerful God, your name is the Lord Who Rules Over All."
Jeremiah,32,19,Your purposes are great. Your acts are mighty. Your eyes see everything people do. You reward each one of them in keeping with their conduct. You do this based on what they have done.
Jeremiah,32,20,You performed signs and wonders in Egypt. And you have continued to do them to this day. You have done them in Israel and among all people. You are still known for doing them.
Jeremiah,32,21,You brought your people Israel out of Egypt. You did it with signs and wonders. You reached out your mighty hand and powerful arm. You did great and wonderful things.
Jeremiah,32,22,You gave Israel this land that you promised to their people of long ago. It is a land that has plenty of milk and honey.
Jeremiah,32,23,Israel came in and took it over. But they did not obey you. They didn’t follow your law. They didn’t do what you commanded them to do. So you brought all this trouble on them.
Jeremiah,32,24,"“ ‘See how ramps are built up against Jerusalem’s walls to attack it. The city will be handed over to the armies of Babylon. They are attacking it. It will fall because of war, hunger and plague. What you said would happen is now happening, as you can see."
Jeremiah,32,25,"Lord and King, the city will be handed over to the armies of Babylon. In spite of that, you tell me to buy a field. You say, “Pay for it with silver. And have the sale witnessed.” ’ ”"
Jeremiah,32,26,"Then a message from the Lord came to Jeremiah. The Lord said,"
Jeremiah,32,27,“I am the Lord . I am the God of all people. Is anything too hard for me?”
Jeremiah,32,28,"So the Lord says, “I am about to hand this city over to the armies of Babylon. I will give it to Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon. He will capture it."
Jeremiah,32,29,The armies of Babylon are now attacking this city. They will come in and set it on fire. They will burn it down. They will burn down the houses where the people made me very angry. They burned incense on their roofs to the god named Baal. And they poured out drink offerings to other gods.
Jeremiah,32,30,"“The people of Israel and Judah have done nothing but evil in my eyes. They have done it since the nation was young. In fact, they have done nothing but make me very angry. They have worshiped statues of gods their own hands have made,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,32,31,“This city has always stirred up my great anger. It has done it since the day it was built. Now I must remove it from my sight.
Jeremiah,32,32,"The people of Israel and Judah have made me very angry. They have done many evil things. They, their kings and officials have sinned. So have their priests and prophets. And the people of Judah and Jerusalem have also sinned."
Jeremiah,32,33,They turned their backs to me. They would not face me. I taught them again and again. But they would not listen or pay attention when they were corrected.
Jeremiah,32,34,They set up the hateful statues of their gods. They did it in the house where I have put my Name. They made my house ‘unclean.’
Jeremiah,32,35,The people built high places for Baal in the Valley of Ben Hinnom. That is where they sacrifice their children to Molek in the fire. That is something I did not command. It did not even enter my mind. They did something I hate. They made Judah sin.”
Jeremiah,32,36,"Here is what you people of Judah are saying about this city. “By war, hunger and plague it will be handed over to the king of Babylon.” But here is what the Lord , the God of Israel, says."
Jeremiah,32,37,“You can be sure that I will gather my people again. I will send them away when my burning anger blazes out against them. But I will bring them back to this place. And I will let them live in safety.
Jeremiah,32,38,They will be my people. And I will be their God.
Jeremiah,32,39,"I will give them a single purpose in life. Then, they will always have respect for me. Then all will go well for them. And it will also go well for their children after them."
Jeremiah,32,40,I will make a covenant with them that will last forever. I promise that I will never stop doing good to them. I will cause them to respect me. Then they will never turn away from me again.
Jeremiah,32,41,I will take pleasure in doing good things for them. I will certainly plant them in this land. I will do these things with all my heart and soul.”
Jeremiah,32,42,"The Lord says, “I have brought all this horrible trouble on these people. But now I will give them all the good things I have promised them."
Jeremiah,32,43,"Once more fields will be bought in this land. It is the land about which you now say, ‘It is a dry and empty desert. It doesn’t have any people or animals in it. It has been handed over to the armies of Babylon.’"
Jeremiah,32,44,"Fields will be bought with silver. Deeds will be signed, sealed and witnessed. That will be done in the territory of Benjamin. It will be done in the villages around Jerusalem and in the towns of Judah. It will also be done in the towns of the central hill country. And it will be done in the towns of the western hills and the Negev Desert. I will bless their people with great success again,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,33,1,"Jeremiah was still being held as a prisoner. He was kept in the courtyard of the guard. Then another message from the Lord came to him. The Lord said,"
Jeremiah,33,2,“I made the earth. I formed it. And I set it in place. The Lord is my name.
Jeremiah,33,3,"Call out to me. I will answer you. I will tell you great things you do not know. And unless I do, you wouldn’t be able to find out about them.”"
Jeremiah,33,4,The Lord is the God of Israel. He speaks about the houses in Jerusalem. He talks about the royal palaces of Judah. The people had torn down many of them. They had used their stones to strengthen the city walls against attack.
Jeremiah,33,5,"That was during their fight with the armies of Babylon. The Lord says, “The houses will be filled with dead bodies. They will be the bodies of the people I will kill. I will kill them when I am very angry with them. I will hide my face from this city. That’s because its people have committed so many sins."
Jeremiah,33,6,“But now I will bring health and healing to Jerusalem. I will heal my people. I will let them enjoy great peace and security.
Jeremiah,33,7,I will bring Judah and Israel back from the places where they have been taken. I will build up the nation again. It will be just as it was before.
Jeremiah,33,8,I will wash from its people all the sins they have committed against me. And I will forgive all the sins they committed when they turned away from me.
Jeremiah,33,9,"Then this city will bring me fame, joy, praise and honor. All the nations on earth will hear about the good things I do for this city. They will see the great success and peace I give it. Then they will be filled with wonder. And they will tremble with fear.”"
Jeremiah,33,10,"The Lord says, “You say about this place, ‘It’s a dry and empty desert. It doesn’t have any people or animals in it.’ The towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem are now deserted. So they do not have any people or animals living in them. But happy sounds will be heard there once more."
Jeremiah,33,11,"They will be the sounds of joy and gladness. The voices of brides and grooms will fill the streets. And the voices of those who bring thank offerings to my house will be heard there. They will say, “ ‘Give thanks to the Lord who rules over all, because he is good. His faithful love continues forever.’ That’s because I will bless this land with great success again. It will be as it was before,” says the Lord."
Jeremiah,33,12,"The Lord who rules over all says, “This place is a desert. It does not have any people or animals in it. But there will again be grasslands near all its towns. Shepherds will rest their flocks there."
Jeremiah,33,13,"Flocks will again pass under the hands of shepherds as they count their sheep,” says the Lord . “That will be done in the towns of the central hill country. It will be done in the western hills and the Negev Desert. It will be done in the territory of Benjamin. And it will be done in the villages around Jerusalem and in the towns of Judah."
Jeremiah,33,14,"“The days are coming,” announces the Lord . “At that time I will fulfill my good promise to my people. I made it to the people of Israel and Judah."
Jeremiah,33,15,“Here is what I will do in those days and at that time. I will make a godly Branch grow from David’s royal line. He will do what is fair and right in the land.
Jeremiah,33,16,In those days Judah will be saved. Jerusalem will live in safety. And it will be called The Lord Who Makes Us Right With Himself.”
Jeremiah,33,17,"The Lord says, “David will always have a son to sit on the throne of Israel."
Jeremiah,33,18,"The priests, who are Levites, will always have a man to serve me. He will sacrifice burnt offerings. He will burn grain offerings. And he will offer sacrifices.”"
Jeremiah,33,19,A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah.
Jeremiah,33,20,"The Lord said, “Could you ever break my covenant with the day? Could you ever break my covenant with the night? Could you ever stop day and night from coming at their appointed times?"
Jeremiah,33,21,Only then could my covenant with my servant David be broken. Only then could my covenant with the Levites who serve me as priests be broken. Only then would David no longer have someone from his family line to rule on his throne.
Jeremiah,33,22,Here is what I will do for my servant David. And here is what I will do for the Levites who serve me. I will make their children after them as many as the stars in the sky. And I will make them as many as the grains of sand on the seashore. It will be impossible to count them.”
Jeremiah,33,23,"A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah. The Lord said,"
Jeremiah,33,24,"“Haven’t you noticed what these people are saying? They say, ‘The Lord once chose the two kingdoms of Israel and Judah. But now he has turned his back on them.’ So they hate my people. They do not think of them as a nation anymore."
Jeremiah,33,25,"I say, ‘What if I had not made my covenant with day and night? What if I had not established the laws of heaven and earth?"
Jeremiah,33,26,"Only then would I turn my back on the children of Jacob and my servant David. Only then would I not choose one of David’s sons to rule over the children of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. But I will bless my people with great success again. I will love them with tender love.’ ”"
Jeremiah,34,1,"Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and all his armies were fighting against Jerusalem. They were also fighting against all the towns around it. All the kingdoms and nations Nebuchadnezzar ruled over were helping him. At that time a message from the Lord came to Jeremiah. The Lord said,"
Jeremiah,34,2,"“I am the Lord , the God of Israel. Go to Zedekiah, the king of Judah. Tell him, ‘The Lord says, “I am about to hand this city over to the king of Babylon. He will burn it down."
Jeremiah,34,3,You will not escape from his power. You will certainly be captured. You will be handed over to him. You will see the king of Babylon with your own eyes. He will speak with you face to face. And you will go to Babylon.
Jeremiah,34,4,"“ ‘ “But listen to the Lord ’s promise to you, Zedekiah king of Judah. I say that you will not be killed by a sword."
Jeremiah,34,5,"You will die in a peaceful way. People made fires to honor the kings who died before you. In the same way, they will make a fire in your honor. They will mourn for you. They will say, ‘My poor master!’ I myself make this promise,” announces the Lord .’ ”"
Jeremiah,34,6,Then Jeremiah the prophet told all this to King Zedekiah in Jerusalem.
Jeremiah,34,7,At that time Nebuchadnezzar’s armies were fighting against Jerusalem. They were also fighting against Lachish and Azekah. These two cities were still holding out. They were the only cities left in Judah that had high walls around them.
Jeremiah,34,8,A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah. King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem. He had told them to set their Hebrew slaves free.
Jeremiah,34,9,All of them had to do this. That applied to male and female slaves alike. No one was allowed to hold another Hebrew as a slave.
Jeremiah,34,10,"So all the officials and people entered into this covenant. They agreed to set their male and female slaves free. They agreed not to hold them as slaves anymore. Instead, they set them free."
Jeremiah,34,11,But later they changed their minds. They took back the people they had set free. They made them slaves again.
Jeremiah,34,12,Then a message from the Lord came to Jeremiah.
Jeremiah,34,13,"The Lord is the God of Israel. He says, “I made a covenant with your people of long ago. I brought them out of Egypt. That is the land where they were slaves. I said,"
Jeremiah,34,14,‘Every seventh year you must set your people free. Each of you must set free all the Hebrews who have sold themselves to you. Let them serve you for six years. Then you must let them go free.’( Deuteronomy 15:12) But your people of long ago did not listen to me. They did not pay any attention to me.
Jeremiah,34,15,Recently you turned away from your sins. You did what is right in my eyes. Each of you set your Hebrew slaves free. You even made a covenant in front of me. You did it in the house where I have put my Name.
Jeremiah,34,16,But now you have turned around. You have treated my name as if it were not holy. Each of you has taken back your male and female slaves. You had set them free to go where they wished. But now you have forced them to become your slaves again.”
Jeremiah,34,17,"So the Lord says, “You have not obeyed me. You have not set your Hebrew slaves free. So now I will set you free,” announces the Lord . “I will set you free to be destroyed by war, plague and hunger. I will make all the kingdoms on earth displeased with you."
Jeremiah,34,18,"Those people who have broken my covenant will be punished. They have not lived up to the terms of the covenant they made in front of me. When you made that covenant, you cut a calf in two. Then you walked between its pieces. Now I will cut you to pieces."
Jeremiah,34,19,"That includes all of you who walked between the pieces of the calf. It includes the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the court officials and the priests. It also includes some of the people of the land."
Jeremiah,34,20,So I will hand over all those people to their enemies who want to kill them. Their dead bodies will become food for the birds and the wild animals.
Jeremiah,34,21,“I will hand over King Zedekiah and his officials to their enemies. I will hand them over to those who want to kill them. I will hand them over to the armies of the king of Babylon. They have now pulled back from you.
Jeremiah,34,22,"But I am going to give an order,” announces the Lord . “I will bring them back to this city. They will fight against it. They will capture it and burn it down. And I will completely destroy the towns of Judah. No one will be able to live there.”"
Jeremiah,35,1,"A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah. It came during the time Jehoiakim was king over Judah. Jehoiakim was the son of Josiah. The message said,"
Jeremiah,35,2,“Go to the members of the family line of Rekab. Invite them to come to one of the side rooms in my house. Then give them wine to drink.”
Jeremiah,35,3,So I went to get Jaazaniah. He was the son of Jeremiah. Jeremiah was the son of Habazziniah. I also went to get Jaazaniah’s brothers and all his sons. That included all the members of the family line of Rekab.
Jeremiah,35,4,I brought them into the Lord ’s house. I took them into the room of the sons of Hanan. He was the son of Igdaliah. He was also a man of God. His room was next to the room of the officials. Their room was above the room of Maaseiah. He was the son of Shallum. He also was one of those who guarded the temple doors.
Jeremiah,35,5,"Then I got bowls full of wine and some cups. I set them down in front of the men from the family line of Rekab. I said to them, “Drink some wine.”"
Jeremiah,35,6,"But they replied, “We don’t drink wine. That’s because Jehonadab gave us a command. He was the son of Rekab. He was also one of our own people from long ago. He commanded, ‘You and your children after you must never drink wine."
Jeremiah,35,7,"Also you must never build houses. You must never plant crops or vineyards. You must never have any of these things. Instead, you must always live in tents. Then you will live a long time in the land where you are wandering around.’"
Jeremiah,35,8,"We have done everything Jehonadab, the son of Rekab, commanded us to do. So we and our wives and our children have never drunk wine."
Jeremiah,35,9,"We have never built houses to live in. We’ve never had vineyards, fields or crops."
Jeremiah,35,10,We’ve always lived in tents. We’ve completely obeyed everything Jehonadab commanded our people of long ago.
Jeremiah,35,11,"But Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, marched into this land. Then we said, ‘Come. We must go to Jerusalem. There we can escape the armies of Babylon and Aram.’ So we have remained in Jerusalem.”"
Jeremiah,35,12,"Then a message from the Lord came to Jeremiah. It said,"
Jeremiah,35,13,"“The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel. He says, ‘Go. Speak to the people of Judah and Jerusalem. Tell them, “Won’t you ever learn a lesson? Won’t you ever obey my words?” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,35,14,"“Jehonadab, the son of Rekab, ordered his children not to drink wine. And they have kept his command. To this day they do not drink wine. They obey the command Jehonadab gave their people long ago. But I have spoken to you again and again. In spite of that, you have not obeyed me."
Jeremiah,35,15,"Again and again I sent all my servants the prophets to you. They said, ‘Each of you must turn from your evil ways. You must change the way you act. Do not worship other gods. Do not serve them. Then you will live in the land. I gave it to you and your people of long ago.’ But you have not paid any attention. You have not listened to me."
Jeremiah,35,16,"The children of Jehonadab, the son of Rekab, have obeyed the command Jehonadab gave them long ago. But the people of Judah have not obeyed me.” ’ ”"
Jeremiah,35,17,"So the Lord God who rules over all speaks. The God of Israel says, “Listen! I am going to bring horrible trouble on Judah. I will also bring it on everyone who lives in Jerusalem. I will bring on them every trouble I said I would. I spoke to them. But they did not listen. I called out to them. But they did not answer.”"
Jeremiah,35,18,"Then Jeremiah spoke to the members of the family line of Rekab. Jeremiah said, “The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel. He says, ‘You have obeyed the command Jehonadab gave your people of long ago. You have followed all his directions. You have done everything he ordered.’"
Jeremiah,35,19,"So the Lord who rules over all speaks. The God of Israel says, ‘Jehonadab, the son of Rekab, will always have someone from his family line to serve me.’ ”"
Jeremiah,36,1,"A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah. It came in the fourth year that Jehoiakim was king of Judah. He was the son of Josiah. The message said,"
Jeremiah,36,2,"“Get a scroll. Write on it all the words I have spoken to you. Write down what I have said about Israel, Judah and all the other nations. Write what I have said to you from the time of King Josiah until now."
Jeremiah,36,3,"The people of Judah will hear about all the trouble I plan to bring on them. Maybe then each of them will turn from their evil ways. If they do, I will forgive their sins and the evil things they have done.”"
Jeremiah,36,4,"So Jeremiah sent for Baruch, the son of Neriah. Jeremiah told him to write down all the words the Lord had spoken to him. And Baruch wrote them on the scroll."
Jeremiah,36,5,"Then Jeremiah said to him, “I’m not allowed to go to the Lord ’s temple."
Jeremiah,36,6,So you go there. Go on a day when the people are fasting. Read to them from the scroll. Read the words of the Lord you wrote down as I gave them to you. Read them to all the people of Judah who come in from their towns.
Jeremiah,36,7,They will hear what the Lord will do to them when his burning anger blazes out against them. Then perhaps they will pray to him. And maybe each of them will turn from their evil ways.”
Jeremiah,36,8,"Baruch, the son of Neriah, did everything Jeremiah the prophet told him to do. He went to the Lord ’s temple. There he read the words of the Lord from the scroll."
Jeremiah,36,9,"It was in the fifth year that Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, was king of Judah. It was the ninth month of that year. A time of fasting at the Lord ’s temple had been ordered. All the people in Jerusalem were told to take part in it. So were those who had come in from the towns of Judah."
Jeremiah,36,10,Baruch read to all the people who were at the Lord ’s temple. He read Jeremiah’s words from the scroll. He was in the room of Gemariah the secretary. It was located in the upper courtyard at the entrance of the New Gate of the temple. Gemariah was the son of Shaphan.
Jeremiah,36,11,"Micaiah was the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan. Micaiah heard Baruch reading all the Lord ’s words that were written on the scroll."
Jeremiah,36,12,"Then he went down to the secretary’s room in the royal palace. All the officials were sitting there. They included the secretary Elishama and Delaiah, the son of Shemaiah. Elnathan, the son of Akbor, was also there. So was Gemariah, the son of Shaphan. Zedekiah, the son of Hananiah, was there too. And so were all the other officials."
Jeremiah,36,13,Micaiah told all of them what he had heard. He told them everything Baruch had read to the people from the scroll.
Jeremiah,36,14,"All the officials sent Jehudi to speak to Baruch, the son of Neriah. Jehudi was the son of Nethaniah. Nethaniah was the son of Shelemiah. Shelemiah was the son of Cushi. Jehudi said to Baruch, “Come. Bring the scroll you have read to the people.” So Baruch went to them. He carried the scroll with him."
Jeremiah,36,15,"The officials said to him, “Please sit down. Read the scroll to us.” So Baruch read it to them."
Jeremiah,36,16,"They heard all its words. Then they looked at one another in fear. They said to Baruch, “We must report all these words to the king.”"
Jeremiah,36,17,"They said to Baruch, “Tell us. How did you happen to write all these things? Did Jeremiah tell you to do this?”"
Jeremiah,36,18,"“Yes,” Baruch replied. “He told me to write down all these words. So I wrote them in ink on the scroll.”"
Jeremiah,36,19,"Then the officials spoke to Baruch. They said, “You and Jeremiah must go and hide. Don’t let anyone know where you are.”"
Jeremiah,36,20,The officials put the scroll in the room of Elishama the secretary. Then they went to the king in the courtyard. They reported everything to him.
Jeremiah,36,21,The king sent Jehudi to get the scroll. Jehudi brought it from the room of Elishama the secretary. Jehudi read it to the king. All the officials were standing beside the king. So they heard it too.
Jeremiah,36,22,It was the ninth month. The king was sitting in his winter apartment. A fire was burning in the fire pot in front of him.
Jeremiah,36,23,Jehudi read three or four sections from the scroll. Then the king cut them off with a secretary’s knife. He threw them into the fire pot. He did that until the entire scroll was burned up in the fire.
Jeremiah,36,24,The king and some of his attendants heard all these words. But they weren’t afraid. They didn’t tear their clothes.
Jeremiah,36,25,"Elnathan, Delaiah and Gemariah begged the king not to burn the scroll. But he wouldn’t listen to them."
Jeremiah,36,26,"Instead, the king commanded three men to arrest Baruch the secretary and Jeremiah the prophet. But the Lord had hidden them. The three men were Jerahmeel, Seraiah and Shelemiah. Jerahmeel was a member of the royal court. Seraiah was the son of Azriel. And Shelemiah was the son of Abdeel."
Jeremiah,36,27,"A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah. It came after the king burned the scroll. On the scroll were the words Baruch had written down. Jeremiah had told him to write them. The message said,"
Jeremiah,36,28,“Get another scroll. Write on it all the words that were on the first one. King Jehoiakim burned that one up.
Jeremiah,36,29,"Also tell King Jehoiakim, ‘The Lord says, “You burned that scroll. You said to Baruch, ‘Why did you write that the king of Babylon would certainly come? Why did you write that he would destroy this land? And why did you write that he would remove from it people and animals alike?’ ”"
Jeremiah,36,30,"So now the Lord has something to say about Jehoiakim, the king of Judah. He says, “No one from Jehoiakim’s family line will sit on David’s throne. Jehoiakim’s body will be thrown out. It will lie outside in the heat by day and in the frost at night."
Jeremiah,36,31,I will punish him and his children and his attendants. I will punish them for their sinful ways. I will bring on them all the trouble I said I would. And I will bring it on the people of Jerusalem and Judah. They have not listened to me.” ’ ”
Jeremiah,36,32,So Jeremiah got another scroll. He gave it to Baruch the secretary. He was the son of Neriah. Jeremiah told Baruch what to write on it. Baruch wrote down all the words that were on the scroll King Jehoiakim had burned up in the fire. And many more words were written on it. They were similar to those that had already been written.
Jeremiah,37,1,"Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, appointed Zedekiah to be king of Judah. He was the son of Josiah. Zedekiah ruled in place of Jehoiachin, the son of Jehoiakim."
Jeremiah,37,2,Zedekiah and his attendants didn’t pay any attention to what the Lord had said through Jeremiah the prophet. And the people of the land didn’t pay any attention either.
Jeremiah,37,3,"But King Zedekiah sent Jehukal to Jeremiah the prophet. Zedekiah sent Zephaniah the priest along with him. Jehukal was the son of Shelemiah. Zephaniah was the son of Maaseiah. Jehukal and Zephaniah brought the king’s message to Jeremiah. It said, “Please pray to the Lord our God for us.”"
Jeremiah,37,4,At that time Jeremiah was free to come and go among the people. Jeremiah had not yet been put in prison.
Jeremiah,37,5,The armies of Babylon were attacking Jerusalem. They received a report that Pharaoh’s army had marched out of Egypt to help Zedekiah. So armies of Babylon pulled back from Jerusalem.
Jeremiah,37,6,A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah.
Jeremiah,37,7,"The Lord is the God of Israel. He says, “The king of Judah has sent you to ask me for advice. Tell him, ‘Pharaoh’s army has marched out to help you. But it will go back to its own land. It will return to Egypt."
Jeremiah,37,8,Then the armies of Babylon will come back here. They will attack this city. They will capture it. Then they will burn it down.’
Jeremiah,37,9,"“The Lord says, ‘Do not fool yourselves. You think, “The Babylonians will leave us alone.” But they will not!"
Jeremiah,37,10,Suppose you destroy all the armies of Babylon that are attacking you. Suppose only wounded men are left in their tents. Even then they will come out and burn down this city.’ ”
Jeremiah,37,11,The armies of Babylon had pulled back from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh’s army.
Jeremiah,37,12,So Jeremiah started to leave the city. He was planning to go to the territory of Benjamin. Jeremiah wanted to get his share of the property among the people there.
Jeremiah,37,13,"He got as far as the Benjamin Gate. But the captain of the guard arrested him. He said, “You are going over to the side of the Babylonians!” The captain’s name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah. Shelemiah was the son of Hananiah."
Jeremiah,37,14,"Jeremiah said to Irijah, “That isn’t true! I’m not going to the side of the Babylonians.” But Irijah wouldn’t listen to him. Instead, he arrested Jeremiah. He brought Jeremiah to the officials."
Jeremiah,37,15,They were angry with him. So they had him beaten. Then they took him to the house of Jonathan the secretary. It had been made into a prison. That’s where they put Jeremiah.
Jeremiah,37,16,Jeremiah was put into a prison cell below ground level. He remained there a long time.
Jeremiah,37,17,"Then King Zedekiah sent for him. King Zedekiah had Jeremiah brought to the palace. There the king spoke to him in private. The king asked, “Do you have a message from the Lord for me?” “Yes,” Jeremiah replied. “You will be handed over to the king of Babylon.”"
Jeremiah,37,18,"Then Jeremiah continued, “Why have you put me in prison? What crime have I committed against you? What have I done to your attendants or these people?"
Jeremiah,37,19,"Where are your prophets who prophesied to you? They said, ‘The king of Babylon won’t attack you. He won’t march into this land.’"
Jeremiah,37,20,"But now please listen, my king and master. Let me make my appeal to you. Please don’t send me back to the house of Jonathan the secretary. If you do, I’ll die there.”"
Jeremiah,37,21,Then King Zedekiah gave the order. His men put Jeremiah in the courtyard of the guard. They gave him a loaf of bread from the street of the bakers. They did it every day until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard.
Jeremiah,38,1,"Shephatiah, Gedaliah, Jehukal and Pashhur heard what Jeremiah was telling all the people. Shephatiah was the son of Mattan. Gedaliah was the son of Pashhur. Jehukal was the son of Shelemiah. And Pashhur was the son of Malkijah. These four men heard Jeremiah say,"
Jeremiah,38,2,"“The Lord says, ‘Those who stay in this city will die of war, hunger or plague. But those who go over to the side of the Babylonians will live. They will escape with their lives. They will remain alive.’"
Jeremiah,38,3,"The Lord also says, ‘This city will certainly be handed over to the armies of the king of Babylon. They will capture it.’ ”"
Jeremiah,38,4,"Then these officials said to the king, “This man should be put to death. What he says is making the soldiers who are left in this city lose hope. It’s making all the people lose hope too. He isn’t interested in what is best for the people. In fact, he’s trying to destroy them.”"
Jeremiah,38,5,"“He’s in your hands,” King Zedekiah answered. “I can’t do anything to oppose you.”"
Jeremiah,38,6,So they took Jeremiah and put him into an empty well. It belonged to Malkijah. He was a member of the royal court. His well was in the courtyard of the guard. Zedekiah’s men lowered Jeremiah by ropes into the well. It didn’t have any water in it. All it had was mud. And Jeremiah sank down into the mud.
Jeremiah,38,7,Ebed-Melek was an official in the royal palace. He was from the land of Cush. He heard that Jeremiah had been put into the well. The king was sitting by the Benjamin Gate at that time.
Jeremiah,38,8,"Ebed-Melek went out of the palace. He said to the king,"
Jeremiah,38,9,"“My king and master, everything these men have done to Jeremiah the prophet is evil. They have thrown him into an empty well. Soon there won’t be any more bread in the city. Then he’ll starve to death.”"
Jeremiah,38,10,"So the king gave an order to Ebed-Melek the Cushite. He said, “Take with you 30 men from here. Lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the well before he dies.”"
Jeremiah,38,11,Then Ebed-Melek took the men with him. He went to a room in the palace. It was under the place where the treasures were stored. He got some old rags and worn-out clothes from there. Then he let them down with ropes to Jeremiah in the well.
Jeremiah,38,12,"Ebed-Melek the Cushite told Jeremiah what to do. Ebed-Melek said, “Put these old rags and worn-out clothes under your arms. They’ll pad the ropes.” So Jeremiah did."
Jeremiah,38,13,Then the men pulled him up with the ropes. They lifted him out of the well. And Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard.
Jeremiah,38,14,"Then King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet. The king had him brought to the third entrance to the Lord ’s temple. “I want to ask you something,” the king said to Jeremiah. “Don’t hide anything from me.”"
Jeremiah,38,15,"Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “Suppose I give you an answer. You will kill me, won’t you? Suppose I give you good advice. You won’t listen to me, will you?”"
Jeremiah,38,16,"But King Zedekiah promised Jeremiah secretly, “I won’t kill you. And I won’t hand you over to those who want to kill you. That’s just as sure as the Lord is alive. He’s the one who has given us breath.”"
Jeremiah,38,17,"So Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “The Lord God who rules over all is the God of Israel. He says, ‘Give yourself up to the officers of the king of Babylon. Then your life will be spared. And this city will not be burned down. You and your family will remain alive."
Jeremiah,38,18,But what if you do not give yourself up to them? Then this city will be handed over to the Babylonians. They will burn it down. And you yourself will not escape from them.’ ”
Jeremiah,38,19,"King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “I’m afraid of some of the Jews. They are the ones who have gone over to the side of the Babylonians. The Babylonians might hand me over to them. And those Jews will treat me badly.”"
Jeremiah,38,20,"“They won’t hand you over to them,” Jeremiah replied. “Obey the Lord . Do what I tell you to do. Then things will go well with you. Your life will be spared."
Jeremiah,38,21,Don’t refuse to give yourself up. The Lord has shown me what will happen if you do.
Jeremiah,38,22,"All the women who are left in your palace will be brought out. They’ll be given to the officials of the king of Babylon. Those women will say to you, “ ‘Your trusted friends have tricked you. They have gotten the best of you. Your feet are sunk down in the mud. Your friends have deserted you.’"
Jeremiah,38,23,“All your wives and children will be brought out to the Babylonians. You yourself won’t escape from them. You will be captured by the king of Babylon. And this city will be burned down.”
Jeremiah,38,24,"Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Don’t let anyone know about the talk we’ve had. If you do, you might die."
Jeremiah,38,25,"Suppose the officials find out that I’ve talked with you. And suppose they come to you and say, ‘Tell us what you said to the king. Tell us what the king said to you. Don’t hide it from us. If you do, we’ll kill you.’"
Jeremiah,38,26,"Then tell them, ‘I was begging the king not to send me back to Jonathan’s house. I don’t want to die there.’ ”"
Jeremiah,38,27,All the officials came to Jeremiah. And they questioned him. He told them everything the king had ordered him to say. None of them had heard what he told the king. So they didn’t say anything else to him.
Jeremiah,38,28,Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard. He stayed there until the day Jerusalem was captured. Here is how Jerusalem was captured.
Jeremiah,39,1,"Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, marched out against Jerusalem. He came with all his armies and attacked it. It was in the ninth year that Zedekiah was king of Judah. It was in the tenth month."
Jeremiah,39,2,The city wall was broken through. It happened on the ninth day of the fourth month. It was in the 11th year of Zedekiah’s rule.
Jeremiah,39,3,"All the officials of the king of Babylon came. They took seats near the Middle Gate. Nergal-Sharezer from Samgar was there. Nebo-Sarsekim, a chief officer, was also there. So was Nergal-Sharezer, a high official. And all the other officials of the king of Babylon were there too."
Jeremiah,39,4,King Zedekiah and all the soldiers saw them. Then they ran away. They left the city at night. They went by way of the king’s garden. They went out through the gate between the two walls. And they headed toward the Arabah Valley.
Jeremiah,39,5,"But the armies of Babylon chased them. They caught up with Zedekiah in the plains near Jericho. They captured him there. And they took him to Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon. He was at Riblah in the land of Hamath. That’s where Nebuchadnezzar decided how Zedekiah would be punished."
Jeremiah,39,6,The king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah at Riblah. He forced Zedekiah to watch it with his own eyes. He also killed all the nobles of Judah.
Jeremiah,39,7,Then he poked out Zedekiah’s eyes. He put him in bronze chains. And he took him to Babylon.
Jeremiah,39,8,The Babylonians set the royal palace on fire. They also set fire to the houses of the people. And they broke down the walls of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah,39,9,Nebuzaradan was commander of the royal guard. Some people still remained in the city. But he took them away to Babylon as prisoners. He also took along those who had gone over to his side. And he took the rest of the people.
Jeremiah,39,10,"Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guard, left some of the poor people of Judah behind. They didn’t own anything. So at that time he gave them vineyards and fields."
Jeremiah,39,11,"Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, had given orders about Jeremiah. He had given them to Nebuzaradan, the commander of the royal guard. Nebuchadnezzar had said,"
Jeremiah,39,12,“Take him. Look after him. Don’t harm him. Do for him anything he asks.”
Jeremiah,39,13,"So that’s what Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guard, did. Nebushazban and Nergal-Sharezer were with him. So were all the other officers of the king of Babylon. Nebushazban was a chief officer. Nergal-Sharezer was a high official. All these men"
Jeremiah,39,14,"sent for Jeremiah. They had him taken out of the courtyard of the guard. They turned him over to Gedaliah. Gedaliah was the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan. They told Gedaliah to take Jeremiah back to his home. So Jeremiah remained among his own people."
Jeremiah,39,15,"A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah. It came while he was being kept in the courtyard of the guard. The Lord said,"
Jeremiah,39,16,"“Go. Speak to Ebed-Melek the Cushite. Tell him, ‘The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel. He says, “I am about to make the words I spoke against this city come true. I will not give success to it. Instead, I will bring horrible trouble on it. At that time my words will come true. You will see it with your own eyes."
Jeremiah,39,17,"But I will save you on that day,” announces the Lord . “You will not be handed over to those you are afraid of."
Jeremiah,39,18,"I will save you. You will not be killed by a sword. Instead, you will escape with your life. That’s because you trust in me,” announces the Lord .’ ”"
Jeremiah,40,1,"A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah. It came after Nebuzaradan, the commander of the royal guard, had set him free at Ramah. Jeremiah was being held by chains when Nebuzaradan found him. Jeremiah was among all the prisoners from Jerusalem and Judah. They were being taken to Babylon."
Jeremiah,40,2,"But the commander of the guard found Jeremiah. The commander said to him, “The Lord your God ordered that this place be destroyed."
Jeremiah,40,3,And now he has brought it about. He has done exactly what he said he would do. All these things have happened because you people sinned against the Lord . You didn’t obey him.
Jeremiah,40,4,"But today I’m setting you free from the chains on your wrists. Come with me to Babylon if you want to. I’ll take good care of you there. But if you don’t want to come, then don’t. The whole country lies in front of you. Go anywhere you want to.”"
Jeremiah,40,5,"But before Jeremiah turned to go, Nebuzaradan continued, “Go back to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam. The king of Babylon has appointed Gedaliah to be over the towns of Judah. Go and live with him among your people. Or go anywhere else you want to.” Ahikam was the son of Shaphan. The commander gave Jeremiah food and water. He also gave him a gift. Then he let Jeremiah go."
Jeremiah,40,6,"So Jeremiah went to Mizpah to see Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam. Jeremiah stayed with him. Jeremiah lived among the people who were left behind in the land."
Jeremiah,40,7,"Some of Judah’s army officers and their men were still in the open country. They heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah as governor over Judah. Gedaliah was the son of Ahikam. The king had put Gedaliah in charge of the men, women and children who were still there. They were the poorest people in the land. They hadn’t been taken to Babylon."
Jeremiah,40,8,"When the army officers and their men heard these things, they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, came. So did Johanan and Jonathan, the sons of Kareah. Seraiah, the son of Tanhumeth, also came. The sons of Ephai from Netophah came too. And so did Jaazaniah, the son of the Maakathite. All their men came with them."
Jeremiah,40,9,"Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, made a promise. He made the promise to give hope to all these men. He spoke in a kind way to them. He said, “Don’t be afraid to serve the Babylonians. Make your homes in the land of Judah. Serve the king of Babylon. Then things will go well with you."
Jeremiah,40,10,"I myself will stay at Mizpah. I’ll speak for you to the officials of Babylon who come to us. But you must harvest the wine, summer fruit and olive oil. Put them in your jars. Store them up. And live in the towns you have taken over.”"
Jeremiah,40,11,"All the Jews in Moab, Ammon and Edom heard what had happened. So did the Jews in all the other countries. They heard that the king of Babylon had left some people behind in Judah. They also heard that he had appointed Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, as governor over them. Ahikam was the son of Shaphan."
Jeremiah,40,12,"When they heard these things, all of them came back to the land of Judah. They went to Gedaliah at Mizpah. They came from all the countries where they had been scattered. And they harvested a large amount of wine and summer fruit."
Jeremiah,40,13,Johanan and all the other army officers still in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. Johanan was the son of Kareah.
Jeremiah,40,14,"The officers spoke to Gedaliah. They said, “Don’t you know that Baalis has sent someone to take your life? Baalis is the king of Ammon. He has sent Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah.” But Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, didn’t believe them."
Jeremiah,40,15,"Then Johanan, the son of Kareah, spoke in private to Gedaliah in Mizpah. He said, “Let me go and kill Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah. No one will know about it. Why should he take your life? Why should he cause all the Jews gathered around you to be scattered? Why should he cause the people who remain in Judah to die?”"
Jeremiah,40,16,"But Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, spoke to Johanan, the son of Kareah. He said, “Don’t do an awful thing like that! What you are saying about Ishmael isn’t true.”"
Jeremiah,41,1,"In the seventh month Ishmael came with ten men to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, at Mizpah. Ishmael was the son of Nethaniah. Nethaniah was the son of Elishama. Ishmael was a member of the royal family. He had been one of the king’s officers. Ishmael and his ten men were eating together at Mizpah."
Jeremiah,41,2,"They got up and struck down Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, with their swords. They killed him even though the king of Babylon had appointed him as governor over Judah. Ahikam was the son of Shaphan."
Jeremiah,41,3,Ishmael also killed all the men of Judah who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah. And he killed the Babylonian soldiers who were there.
Jeremiah,41,4,"On the next day, people still hadn’t found out that Gedaliah had been murdered."
Jeremiah,41,5,"On that day 80 men came from Shechem, Shiloh and Samaria. They had shaved off their beards. They had torn their clothes. And they had cut themselves. They brought grain offerings and incense with them. They took them to the Lord ’s house."
Jeremiah,41,6,"Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, went out from Mizpah to meet them. He was weeping as he went. When he met them, he said, “Come to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam.”"
Jeremiah,41,7,"They went with him into the city. Then Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, and the men who were with him killed them. And they threw them into an empty well."
Jeremiah,41,8,"But ten of the men had spoken to Ishmael. They had said, “Don’t kill us! We have some wheat and barley. We also have olive oil and honey. We’ve hidden all of it in a field.” So he didn’t kill them along with the others."
Jeremiah,41,9,"But he had thrown into the empty well all the bodies of the men he had killed. That included Gedaliah’s body. The well was the one King Asa had made. He had made it when he strengthened Mizpah against attack by Baasha, the king of Israel. Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, filled it with the bodies of those he had killed."
Jeremiah,41,10,Nebuzaradan was the commander of the royal guard. He had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam over all the people at Mizpah. But Ishmael made prisoners of the people left at Mizpah. These prisoners included women who were members of the royal court. The prisoners also included everyone else left at Mizpah. Then Ishmael started out to go across the Jordan River to the land of Ammon.
Jeremiah,41,11,"Johanan, the son of Kareah, was told what had happened. And so were all the other army officers with him. They heard about all the crimes Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, had committed."
Jeremiah,41,12,"So they brought all their men together. Then they went to fight against Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah. They caught up with him near the large pool in Gibeon."
Jeremiah,41,13,"Ishmael had many people with him. They saw Johanan, the son of Kareah. And they saw the other army officers who were with him. So the people who had been forced to go with Ishmael were glad."
Jeremiah,41,14,"Ishmael had taken those people from Mizpah as prisoners. But now they turned and went over to the side of Johanan, the son of Kareah."
Jeremiah,41,15,"But Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, and eight of his men escaped from Johanan. They ran away to the land of Ammon."
Jeremiah,41,16,"Then Johanan, the son of Kareah, led away all the people of Mizpah who were still alive. All the other army officers with Johanan helped him do this. He had taken them away from Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah. That happened after Ishmael had murdered Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam. The people Johanan had taken away included soldiers, women, children and court officials. He had brought them from Gibeon."
Jeremiah,41,17,They went on their way. They stopped at Geruth Kimham near Bethlehem. They were going to Egypt.
Jeremiah,41,18,"They wanted to get away from the Babylonians. They were afraid of them. That’s because Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, had killed Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam. The king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah as governor over Judah."
Jeremiah,42,1,"Then all the army officers approached Jeremiah. They included Johanan, the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah, the son of Hoshaiah. All the people from the least important of them to the most important also came."
Jeremiah,42,2,"All of them said to Jeremiah the prophet, “Please listen to our appeal. Pray to the Lord your God. Pray for all of us who are left here. Once there were many of us. But as you can see, only a few of us are left now."
Jeremiah,42,3,So pray to the Lord your God. Pray that he’ll tell us where we should go. Pray that he’ll tell us what we should do.”
Jeremiah,42,4,"“I’ve heard you,” Jeremiah the prophet replied. “I’ll certainly pray to the Lord your God. I’ll do what you have asked me to do. In fact, I’ll tell you everything the Lord says. I won’t keep anything back from you.”"
Jeremiah,42,5,"Then they said to Jeremiah, “We’ll do everything the Lord your God sends you to tell us to do. If we don’t, may he be a true and faithful witness against us."
Jeremiah,42,6,It doesn’t matter whether what you say is in our favor or not. We’re asking you to pray to the Lord our God. And we’ll obey him. Things will go well with us. That’s because we will obey the Lord our God.”
Jeremiah,42,7,Ten days later a message came to Jeremiah from the Lord.
Jeremiah,42,8,"So Jeremiah sent for Johanan, the son of Kareah, and all the other army officers with him. Jeremiah also gathered together all the people from the least important of them to the most important."
Jeremiah,42,9,"He said to all of them, “The Lord is the God of Israel. You asked me to present your appeal to him. He told me,"
Jeremiah,42,10,‘Stay in this land. Then I will build you up. I will not tear you down. I will plant you. I will not pull you up by the roots. I have decided to stop bringing trouble on you.
Jeremiah,42,11,"Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon. You are afraid of him now. Do not be,’ announces the Lord . ‘I am with you. I will keep you safe. I will save you from his power."
Jeremiah,42,12,I will show you my loving concern. Then he will have concern for you. And he will let you return to your land.’
Jeremiah,42,13,"“But suppose you say, ‘We won’t stay in this land.’ If you do, you will be disobeying the Lord your God."
Jeremiah,42,14,"And suppose you say, ‘No! We’ll go and live in Egypt. There we won’t have to face war anymore. We won’t hear the trumpets of war. And we won’t get hungry.’"
Jeremiah,42,15,"Then listen to what the Lord says to you who are left in Judah. He is the Lord who rules over all. He is the God of Israel. He says, ‘Have you already made up your minds to go to Egypt? Are you going to make your homes there?"
Jeremiah,42,16,Then the war you fear will catch up with you there. The hunger you are afraid of will follow you into Egypt. And you will die there.
Jeremiah,42,17,"In fact, that will happen to all those who go and make their homes in Egypt. All of them will die of war, hunger and plague. Not one of them will live. None of them will escape the trouble I will bring on them.’"
Jeremiah,42,18,"He is the Lord who rules over all. He is the God of Israel. He says, ‘My great anger has been poured out on those who used to live in Jerusalem. In the same way, it will be poured out on you when you go to Egypt. People will use your name in a curse. They will be shocked at you. They will say bad things about you. And they will say you are shameful. You will never see this place again.’"
Jeremiah,42,19,"“The Lord has spoken to you who are left in Judah. He has said, ‘Do not go to Egypt.’ Here is something you can be sure of. I am warning you about it today."
Jeremiah,42,20,"You made a big mistake when you asked me to pray to the Lord your God. You said, ‘Pray to the Lord our God for us. Tell us everything he says. We’ll do it.’"
Jeremiah,42,21,I have told you today what the Lord your God wants you to do. But you still haven’t obeyed him. You haven’t done anything he sent me to tell you to do.
Jeremiah,42,22,"So here is something else you can be sure of. You will die of war, hunger and plague. You want to go and make your homes in Egypt. But you will die there.”"
Jeremiah,43,1,Jeremiah finished telling the people everything the Lord their God had said. Jeremiah told them everything the Lord had sent him to tell them.
Jeremiah,43,2,"After that, Azariah, the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan, the son of Kareah, spoke to Jeremiah. And all the proud men joined them. They said, “You are lying! The Lord our God hasn’t sent you to speak to us. He hasn’t told you to say, ‘You must not go to Egypt and make your homes there.’"
Jeremiah,43,3,"But Baruch, the son of Neriah, is turning you against us. He wants us to be handed over to the Babylonians. Then they can kill us. Or they can take us away to Babylon.”"
Jeremiah,43,4,"So Johanan, the son of Kareah, disobeyed the Lord ’s command. So did all the other army officers and all the people. They didn’t stay in the land of Judah."
Jeremiah,43,5,"Instead Johanan, the son of Kareah, and all the other army officers led away all the people who were left in Judah. Those people had returned to Judah from all the nations where they had been scattered."
Jeremiah,43,6,"Johanan and the other officers also led away many people Nebuzaradan had left at Mizpah. They included men, women and children. They also included the king’s daughters. Nebuzaradan had left them with Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam. They also took Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch son of Neriah along with them. Nebuzaradan was commander of the royal guard. Ahikam was the son of Shaphan."
Jeremiah,43,7,So the Jewish leaders disobeyed the Lord . They took everyone to Egypt. They went all the way to Tahpanhes.
Jeremiah,43,8,"In Tahpanhes a message from the Lord came to Jeremiah. The Lord said,"
Jeremiah,43,9,“Make sure the Jews are watching you. Then get some large stones. Go to the entrance to Pharaoh’s house in Tahpanhes. Bury the stones in the clay under the brick walkway there.
Jeremiah,43,10,"Then tell the Jews, ‘The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel. He says, “I will send for my servant Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon. And I will set his throne over these stones that are buried here. He will set up his royal tent over them."
Jeremiah,43,11,He will come and attack Egypt. He will bring death to those I have appointed to die. He will take away as prisoners those I have appointed to be taken away. And he will kill with swords those I have appointed to be killed.
Jeremiah,43,12,He will set the temples of the gods of Egypt on fire. He will burn down their temples. He will take away the statues of their gods. Nebuchadnezzar will be like a shepherd who picks his coat clean of lice. Nebuchadnezzar will pick Egypt clean and then depart.
Jeremiah,43,13,At Heliopolis in Egypt he will smash the sacred pillars to pieces. And he will burn down the temples of the gods of Egypt.” ’ ”
Jeremiah,44,1,"A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah. It was about all the Jews living in Lower Egypt. They were living in Migdol, Tahpanhes and Memphis. It was also about all the Jews living in Upper Egypt."
Jeremiah,44,2,"The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel. He said, “You saw all the trouble I brought on Jerusalem. I also brought it on all the towns in Judah. Today they lie there deserted and destroyed."
Jeremiah,44,3,That’s because of the evil things their people did. They made me very angry. They burned incense to other gods. And they worshiped them. They and you and your people of long ago never knew those gods.
Jeremiah,44,4,"Again and again I sent my servants the prophets. They said, ‘Don’t worship other gods! The Lord hates it!’"
Jeremiah,44,5,But the people didn’t listen. They didn’t pay any attention. They didn’t turn from their sinful ways. They didn’t stop burning incense to other gods.
Jeremiah,44,6,So my burning anger was poured out. It blazed out against the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem. It made them the dry and empty places they are today.”
Jeremiah,44,7,"The Lord God who rules over all is the God of Israel. He says, “Why do you want to bring all this trouble on yourselves? You are removing from Judah its men and women, its children and babies. Not one of you will be left."
Jeremiah,44,8,"Why do you want to make me angry with the gods your hands have made? Why do you burn incense to the gods of Egypt, where you now live? You will destroy yourselves. All the nations on earth will use your name as a curse. They will say you are shameful."
Jeremiah,44,9,Have you forgotten the evil things done by your people of long ago? The kings and queens of Judah did those same things. So did you and your wives. They were done in the land of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah,44,10,To this day the people of Judah have not made themselves humble in my sight. They have not shown any respect for me. They have not obeyed my law. They have not followed the rules I gave you and your people of long ago.”
Jeremiah,44,11,"The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel. He says, “I have decided to bring horrible trouble on you. I will destroy the whole land of Judah."
Jeremiah,44,12,"I will destroy the people of Judah who are left. They had decided to go to Egypt and make their homes there. But all of them will die in Egypt. They will die of war or hunger. All of them will die, from the least important of them to the most important. They will die of war or hunger. People will use their name as a curse. They will be shocked at them. They will say bad things about them. And they will say they are shameful."
Jeremiah,44,13,"I will use war, hunger and plague to punish the Jews who live in Egypt. I punished Jerusalem in the same way."
Jeremiah,44,14,None of the people of Judah who have gone to live in Egypt will escape. Not one of them will live to return to Judah. They long to return and live there. But only a few will escape from Egypt and go back.”
Jeremiah,44,15,"All the Jews who were living in Lower and Upper Egypt gathered to give Jeremiah their answer. A large crowd had come together. It included men who knew that their wives were burning incense to other gods. Their wives were there with them. All of them said to Jeremiah,"
Jeremiah,44,16,“We won’t listen to the message you have spoken to us in the Lord ’s name!
Jeremiah,44,17,We will certainly do everything we said we would. We’ll burn incense to the female god called the Queen of Heaven. We’ll pour out drink offerings to her. We’ll do just as we and our people of long ago have done. Our kings and our officials also did it. All of us did it in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem. At that time we had plenty of food. We were well off. We didn’t suffer any harm.
Jeremiah,44,18,"But then we stopped burning incense to the Queen of Heaven. We stopped pouring out drink offerings to her. And ever since that time we haven’t had anything. Instead, we’ve been dying of war and hunger.”"
Jeremiah,44,19,"The women added, “We burned incense to the Queen of Heaven. We poured out drink offerings to her. And our husbands knew we were making cakes that looked like her. They knew we were pouring out drink offerings to her.”"
Jeremiah,44,20,"Then Jeremiah spoke to all the people who were answering him. He spoke to men and women alike. He said,"
Jeremiah,44,21,“Didn’t the Lord know you were burning incense in the towns of Judah? Didn’t he care that you were also doing it in the streets of Jerusalem? You and your people of long ago were doing it. Your kings and officials were doing it too. So were the rest of the people in the land.
Jeremiah,44,22,The Lord couldn’t put up any longer with the evil things you were doing. He hated the things you did. So your land became a curse. It became a dry and empty desert. No one lived there. And that’s the way it still is today.
Jeremiah,44,23,You have burned incense to other gods. You have sinned against the Lord . You haven’t obeyed him or his law. You haven’t followed his rules. You haven’t lived up to the terms of the covenant he made with you. That’s why all this trouble has come on you. You have seen it with your own eyes.”
Jeremiah,44,24,"Then Jeremiah spoke to all the people. That included the women. He said, “All you people of Judah in Egypt, listen to the Lord ’s message."
Jeremiah,44,25,"The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel. He says, ‘You and your wives have done what you promised you would do. You said, “We will certainly keep the promises we made to the Queen of Heaven. We’ll burn incense to her. We’ll pour out drink offerings to her.” ’ “Go ahead then. Do what you said you would! Keep your promises!"
Jeremiah,44,26,"But listen to the Lord ’s message. Listen, all you Jews living in Egypt. ‘I make a promise by my own great name,’ says the Lord . ‘Here is what I promise. “No one from Judah who lives anywhere in Egypt will ever again pray in my name. None of them will ever make this promise. They will never say, ‘You can be sure that the Lord and King is alive.’ ”"
Jeremiah,44,27,I am watching over them to do them harm and not good. The Jews in Egypt will die of war and hunger until all of them are destroyed.
Jeremiah,44,28,Some will not be killed. They will return to Judah from Egypt. But they will be very few. Then all the people of Judah who came to live in Egypt will know the truth. They will know whether what I say or what they say will come true.
Jeremiah,44,29,"“ ‘I will give you a sign that I will punish you in this place,’ announces the Lord . ‘Then you can be sure that my warnings of harm against you will come true.’"
Jeremiah,44,30,"The Lord says, ‘I am going to hand over Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt. I will hand him over to his enemies who want to kill him. In the same way, I handed over King Zedekiah to Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon. He was the enemy who wanted to kill Zedekiah.’ ”"
Jeremiah,45,1,"Jeremiah talked to Baruch, the son of Neriah. It was in the fourth year that Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, was king of Judah. It was when Baruch had written down on a scroll the words Jeremiah the prophet told him to write. Jeremiah had said,"
Jeremiah,45,2,"“The Lord is the God of Israel. Baruch, he says to you,"
Jeremiah,45,3,"‘You have said, “How terrible it is for me! The Lord has added sorrow to my pain. I’m worn out from all my groaning. I can’t find any rest.” ’"
Jeremiah,45,4,"But here is what the Lord has told me to say to you, Baruch. ‘The Lord says, “I will destroy what I have built up. I will pull up by the roots what I have planted. I will do this throughout the earth."
Jeremiah,45,5,"So should you seek great things for yourself? Do not seek them. I will bring trouble on everyone,” announces the Lord . “But no matter where you go, I will let you escape with your life.” ’ ”"
Jeremiah,46,1,A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet. It was about the nations.
Jeremiah,46,2,"Here is what the Lord says about Egypt. Here is his message against the army of Pharaoh Necho. He was king of Egypt. Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, won the battle over Necho’s army. That happened at Carchemish on the Euphrates River. It was in the fourth year that Jehoiakim was king of Judah. He was the son of Josiah. The message says,"
Jeremiah,46,3,"“Egyptians, prepare your shields! Prepare large and small shields alike! March out for battle!"
Jeremiah,46,4,Get the horses and chariots ready to ride! Take up your battle positions! Put on your helmets! Shine up your spears! Put on your armor!
Jeremiah,46,5,"What do I see? The Egyptians are terrified. They are pulling back. Their soldiers are losing. They run away as fast as they can. They do not look back. There is terror on every side,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,46,6,“Those who run fast can’t get away. Those who are strong can’t escape. In the north by the Euphrates River they trip and fall.
Jeremiah,46,7,“Who is this that rises like the Nile River? Who rises like rivers of rushing waters?
Jeremiah,46,8,"Egypt rises like the Nile River. It rises like rivers of rushing waters. Egypt says, ‘I will rise and cover the earth. I’ll destroy cities and their people.’"
Jeremiah,46,9,"Charge, you horses! Drive fast, you chariot drivers! March on, you soldiers! March on, you men of Cush and Put who carry shields. March on, you men of Lydia who shoot arrows."
Jeremiah,46,10,But that day belongs to me. I am the Lord who rules over all. It is a day for me to pay back my enemies. My sword will eat until it is satisfied. It will drink until it is not thirsty for blood anymore. I am the Lord. I am the Lord who rules over all. I will offer a sacrifice. I will offer it in the land of the north by the Euphrates River.
Jeremiah,46,11,"“People of Egypt, go up to Gilead and get some healing lotion. You may try many medicines, but you will not be healed. There isn’t any healing for you."
Jeremiah,46,12,The nations will hear about your shame. Your cries of pain will fill the earth. One soldier will trip over another. Both of them will fall down together.”
Jeremiah,46,13,"Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, was coming to attack Egypt. Here is the message the Lord spoke to Jeremiah the prophet about it. He said,"
Jeremiah,46,14,"“Egyptians, here is what I want you to announce in your land. Announce it in the city of Migdol. Also announce it in Memphis and Tahpanhes. Say, ‘Take up your battle positions! Get ready! The sword eats up those around you.’"
Jeremiah,46,15,"Why are your soldiers lying on the ground? They can’t stand, because I bring them down."
Jeremiah,46,16,"They will trip again and again. They will fall over one another. They will say, ‘Get up. Let’s go back home. Let’s return to our own people and our own lands. Let’s get away from the swords that will bring us great harm.’"
Jeremiah,46,17,"The Egyptian soldiers will cry out, ‘Pharaoh, our king, is only a loud noise. He has missed his chance to win the battle.’"
Jeremiah,46,18,"“I am the King. My name is the Lord Who Rules Over All. Someone will come who is like Mount Tabor among the mountains. He is like Mount Carmel by the Mediterranean Sea. And that is just as sure as I am alive,” announces the King."
Jeremiah,46,19,"“So pack your belongings, you who live in Egypt. You will be taken away from your land. Memphis will be completely destroyed. Its buildings will be broken down. No one will live there."
Jeremiah,46,20,“Egypt is like a beautiful young cow. But Nebuchadnezzar is coming against her from the north. He will bite her like a fly.
Jeremiah,46,21,Hired soldiers are in Egypt’s army. They are like fat calves. All of them will turn and run away. They will not hold their positions. The day of trouble is coming on them. The time for them to be punished is near.
Jeremiah,46,22,The Egyptians will hiss like a snake that is trying to get away. A powerful army will advance against them. Their enemies will come against them with axes. They will be like those who cut down trees.
Jeremiah,46,23,"Egypt is like a thick forest. But they will chop it down,” announces the Lord. “There are more of their enemies than there are locusts. In fact, they can’t even be counted."
Jeremiah,46,24,The nation of Egypt will be put to shame. It will be handed over to the people of the north.”
Jeremiah,46,25,"The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel. He says, “I am about to punish Amon, the god of Thebes. I will also punish Pharaoh. I will punish Egypt and its gods and kings. And I will punish those who depend on Pharaoh."
Jeremiah,46,26,"I will hand them over to those who want to kill them. I will give them to Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and his officers. But later, many people will live in Egypt again as in times past,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,46,27,"“People of Jacob, do not be afraid. You are my servant. Israel, do not be terrified. I will bring you safely out of a place far away. I will bring your children back from the land where they were taken. Your people will have peace and security again. And no one will make them afraid."
Jeremiah,46,28,"People of Jacob, do not be afraid. You are my servant. I am with you,” announces the Lord. “I will completely destroy all the nations among which I scatter you. But I will not completely destroy you. I will correct you. But I will be fair. I will not let you go without any punishment.”"
Jeremiah,47,1,A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet. It was about the Philistines before Pharaoh attacked the city of Gaza.
Jeremiah,47,2,"The Lord said, “The armies of Babylon are like waters rising in the north. They will become a great flood. They will flow over the land and everything in it. They will flow over the towns and those who live in them. The people will cry out. All those who live in the land will weep."
Jeremiah,47,3,They will weep when they hear galloping horses. They will weep at the noise of enemy chariots. They will weep at the rumble of their wheels. Parents will not even try to help their children. Their hands will not be able to help them.
Jeremiah,47,4,The day has come to destroy all the Philistines. The time has come to remove all those who could help Tyre and Sidon. I am about to destroy the Philistines. I will not leave anyone alive who came from the coasts of Crete.
Jeremiah,47,5,"The people of Gaza will be so sad they will shave their heads. And Ashkelon’s people will be silent. You who remain on the plain, how long will you cut yourselves?"
Jeremiah,47,6,“ ‘Sword of the Lord !’ you cry out. ‘How long will it be until you rest? Return to the place you came from. Stop killing us! Be still!’
Jeremiah,47,7,But how can his sword rest when the Lord has given it a command? He has ordered it to attack Ashkelon and the Philistine coast.”
Jeremiah,48,1,"Here is what the Lord says about Moab. The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel. He says, “How terrible it will be for the city of Nebo! It will be destroyed. Kiriathaim will be captured. It will be put to shame. Its fort will be broken down. It will be put to shame."
Jeremiah,48,2,"Moab will not be praised anymore. In Heshbon people will plan its fall from power. They will say, ‘Come. Let’s put an end to that nation.’ City of Madmen, you too will be silent. My sword will hunt you down."
Jeremiah,48,3,Cries of sorrow come from Horonaim. The town is being completely destroyed.
Jeremiah,48,4,Moab will be broken. Her little ones will cry out.
Jeremiah,48,5,The people go up the hill to Luhith. They are weeping bitterly as they go. Loud cries are heard on the road down to Horonaim. People cry out because the town is being destroyed.
Jeremiah,48,6,"People of Moab, run away! Run for your lives! Become like a lonely bush in the desert."
Jeremiah,48,7,You trust in the things you can do. You trust in your riches. So you too will be taken away as prisoners. Your god named Chemosh will be carried away. So will its priests and officials.
Jeremiah,48,8,The one who is going to destroy you will come against every town. Not even one of them will escape. The valley and the high plain will be destroyed. The Lord has spoken.
Jeremiah,48,9,Sprinkle salt all over Moab. It will be completely destroyed. Its towns will be a dry and empty desert. No one will live in them.
Jeremiah,48,10,“May anyone who is lazy when they do the Lord ’s work be under my curse! May anyone who keeps their sword from killing be under my curse!
Jeremiah,48,11,“Moab has been at peace and rest from its earliest days. It is like wine that has not been shaken up. It has not been poured from one jar to another. Moab’s people have not been taken away from their land. They are like wine that tastes as it always did. Its smell has not changed at all.
Jeremiah,48,12,"But other days are coming,” announces the Lord. “At that time I will send people who pour wine from pitchers. They will pour Moab out like wine. They will empty its pitchers. They will smash its jars."
Jeremiah,48,13,Then Moab’s people will be ashamed of their god named Chemosh. They will be ashamed just as the people of Israel were when they trusted in their false god at Bethel.
Jeremiah,48,14,"“How can you say, ‘We are soldiers. We are men who are brave in battle’?"
Jeremiah,48,15,"Moab will be destroyed. Its enemies will march into its towns. Its finest young men will die in battle,” announces the King. His name is the Lord Who Rules Over All."
Jeremiah,48,16,“The fall of Moab is near. Its time of trouble will come quickly.
Jeremiah,48,17,"All you who live around it, mourn for its people. Be sad, you who know how famous Moab is. Say, ‘Its powerful ruler’s scepter is broken! His glorious scepter is smashed.’"
Jeremiah,48,18,"“Come down from your glorious city, you who live in Dibon. Come and sit on the thirsty ground. The one who destroys Moab will come up and attack you. Your enemies will destroy your cities that have high walls around them."
Jeremiah,48,19,"Stand by the road and watch, you who live in Aroer. Ask the men who are running away. Ask the women who are escaping. Ask them, ‘What has happened?’"
Jeremiah,48,20,Moab has been put to shame. It has been destroyed. Weep and cry out! Tell everyone Moab has been destroyed. Announce it by the Arnon River.
Jeremiah,48,21,"The high plain has been judged. So have Holon, Jahzah and Mephaath."
Jeremiah,48,22,"Dibon, Nebo and Beth Diblathaim have been judged."
Jeremiah,48,23,"So have Kiriathaim, Beth Gamul and Beth Meon."
Jeremiah,48,24,"Kerioth and Bozrah have also been judged. And so have all the towns of Moab, far and near alike."
Jeremiah,48,25,"Moab’s power is gone. Its strength is broken,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,48,26,“Moab’s people think they are better than I am. So let their enemies make them drunk. Let the people get sick and throw up. Let them roll around in the mess they have made. Let people laugh at them.
Jeremiah,48,27,"Moab, you laughed at Israel, didn’t you? Were Israel’s people caught among robbers? Is that why you shake your head at them? Is that why you make fun of them every time you talk about them?"
Jeremiah,48,28,"Leave your towns, you who live in Moab. Go and live among the rocks. Be like a dove that makes its nest at the entrance of a cave."
Jeremiah,48,29,“We have heard all about Moab’s pride. We have heard how very proud they are. They think they are so much better than others. Their pride reaches deep down inside their hearts.
Jeremiah,48,30,"I know how rude they are. But it will not get them anywhere,” announces the Lord. “Their bragging does not accomplish anything."
Jeremiah,48,31,So I weep over Moab. I cry for all Moab’s people. I groan for the people of Kir Hareseth.
Jeremiah,48,32,"I weep for you as Jazer weeps, you vines of Sibmah. Your branches used to spread out. They went all the way down to the Dead Sea. They reached as far as the sea of Jazer. The one who destroys your country has taken away your grapes and ripe fruit."
Jeremiah,48,33,Joy has left your orchards. Gladness is gone from your fields. I have stopped the flow of juice from your winepresses. No one stomps on your grapes with shouts of joy. There are shouts. But they are not shouts of joy.
Jeremiah,48,34,“The sound of their cry rises from Heshbon. It rises as far as Elealeh and Jahaz. It rises from Zoar. It goes all the way to Horonaim and Eglath Shelishiyah. Even the waters at Nimrim are dried up.
Jeremiah,48,35,"In Moab people sacrifice offerings on the high places. They burn incense to their gods. But I will put an end to those people,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,48,36,“Like a flute my heart sings a song of sadness for Moab. It sings like a flute for the people of Kir Hareseth. The wealth they had acquired is gone.
Jeremiah,48,37,Every head is shaved. Every beard is cut off. Every hand is cut. And every waist is covered with the clothes of sadness.
Jeremiah,48,38,"Weeping is the only sound in Moab. It is heard on all its roofs. It is heard in the market. I have broken Moab like a jar that no one wants,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,48,39,“How broken Moab is! How the people weep! They turn away from others because they are so ashamed. All those around them laugh at them. They are shocked at them.”
Jeremiah,48,40,"The Lord says, “Look! Nebuchadnezzar is like an eagle diving down. He is spreading his wings over Moab."
Jeremiah,48,41,Kerioth will be captured. Its forts will be taken. At that time the hearts of Moab’s soldiers will tremble in fear. They will be like the heart of a woman having a baby.
Jeremiah,48,42,Moab will be destroyed as a nation. That is because its people thought they were better than the Lord.
Jeremiah,48,43,"You people of Moab,” announces the Lord, “terror, a pit and a trap are waiting for you."
Jeremiah,48,44,"Anyone who runs away from the terror will fall into the pit. Anyone who climbs out of the pit will be caught in the trap. The time is coming when I will punish Moab,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,48,45,“In the shadow of Heshbon those who are trying to escape stand helpless. A fire has blazed out from Heshbon. Flames have come out from Sihon’s city. It burns the foreheads of Moab’s people. It burns the skulls of those who brag loudly.
Jeremiah,48,46,"How terrible it will be for you, Moab! Those who worship Chemosh are destroyed. Your sons are being taken to another country. Your daughters are taken away as prisoners."
Jeremiah,48,47,"“But in days to come I will bless Moab with great success again,” announces the Lord. This ends the report about how the Lord would judge Moab."
Jeremiah,49,1,"Here is what the Lord says about the people of Ammon. He says, “Doesn’t Israel have any sons? Doesn’t Israel have anyone to take over the family property? Then why has the god named Molek taken over Gad? Why do those who worship him live in its towns?"
Jeremiah,49,2,"But a new day is coming,” announces the Lord. “At that time I will sound the battle cry. I will sound it against Rabbah in the land of Ammon. It will become a pile of broken-down buildings. The villages around it will be set on fire. Then Israel will drive out those who drove her out,” says the Lord."
Jeremiah,49,3,"“Heshbon, weep for Ai! It is destroyed! Cry out, you who live in Rabbah! Put on the clothes of sadness and mourn. Run here and there inside the walls. Your god named Molek will be carried away. So will its priests and officials."
Jeremiah,49,4,"Why do you brag about your valleys? You brag that they produce so many crops. Ammon, you are an unfaithful country. You trust in your riches. You say, ‘Who will attack me?’"
Jeremiah,49,5,"I will bring terror on you. It will come from all those around you,” announces the Lord. He is the Lord who rules over all. “Every one of you will be driven away. No one will bring back those who escape."
Jeremiah,49,6,"“But after that, I will bless the people of Ammon with great success again,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,49,7,"Here is what the Lord says about Edom. The Lord who rules over all says, “Isn’t there wisdom in the town of Teman anymore? Can’t those who are wise give advice? Has their wisdom disappeared completely?"
Jeremiah,49,8,"Turn around and run away, you who live in Dedan. Hide in deep caves. I will bring trouble on Esau’s family line. I will do this at the time I punish them."
Jeremiah,49,9,"Edom, suppose grape pickers came to harvest your vines. They would still leave a few grapes. Suppose robbers came at night. They would steal only as much as they wanted."
Jeremiah,49,10,"But I will strip everything away from Esau’s people. I will uncover their hiding places. They will not be able to hide anywhere. Their army is destroyed. Their friends and neighbors are destroyed. So there is no one to say,"
Jeremiah,49,11,‘Leave your children whose fathers have died. I will keep them alive. Your widows can also depend on me.’ ”
Jeremiah,49,12,"The Lord says, “What if those who do not have to drink the cup must drink it anyway? Then shouldn’t you be punished? You will certainly be punished. You must drink the cup."
Jeremiah,49,13,"I make a promise in my own name. Bozrah will be destroyed,” announces the Lord . “People will be shocked at it. They will say Bozrah is a shameful place. They will use its name as a curse. And all its towns will be destroyed forever.”"
Jeremiah,49,14,"I’ve heard a message from the Lord. A messenger was sent to the nations. The Lord told him to say, “Gather yourselves together to attack Edom! Prepare for battle!”"
Jeremiah,49,15,"The Lord says to Edom, “I will make you weak among the nations. They will hate you."
Jeremiah,49,16,"You live in the safety of the rocks. You live on top of the hills. But the terror you stir up has now turned against you. Your proud heart has tricked you. You build your nest as high as an eagle does. But I will bring you down from there,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,49,17,"“People of Edom, all those who pass by you will be shocked. They will make fun of you because of all your wounds."
Jeremiah,49,18,"Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed. So were the towns that were near them,” says the Lord. “You will be just like them. No one will live in your land. No human beings will stay there."
Jeremiah,49,19,“I will be like a lion coming up from the bushes by the Jordan River. I will hunt in rich grasslands. I will chase you from your land in an instant. What nation will I choose to do this? Which one will I appoint? Is anyone like me? Who would dare to argue with me? What leader can stand against me?”
Jeremiah,49,20,So listen to what the Lord has planned against the people of Edom. Hear what he has planned against those who live in Teman. Edom’s young people will be dragged away. Their grasslands will be shocked at their fate.
Jeremiah,49,21,"When the earth hears Edom fall, it will shake. The people’s cries will be heard all the way to the Red Sea."
Jeremiah,49,22,Look! An enemy is coming. It’s like an eagle diving down. It will spread its wings over Bozrah. At that time the hearts of Edom’s soldiers will tremble in fear. They’ll be like the heart of a woman having a baby.
Jeremiah,49,23,"Here is what the Lord says about Damascus. He says, “The people of Hamath and Arpad are terrified. They have heard bad news. They have lost all hope. They are troubled like the rolling sea."
Jeremiah,49,24,The people of Damascus have become weak. They have turned to run away. Panic has taken hold of them. Suffering and pain have taken hold of them. Their pain is like the pain of a woman having a baby.
Jeremiah,49,25,Why hasn’t the famous city been deserted? It is the town I take delight in.
Jeremiah,49,26,"You can be sure its young men will fall dead in the streets. All its soldiers will be put to death at that time,” announces the Lord who rules over all."
Jeremiah,49,27,“I will set the walls of Damascus on fire. It will burn down the strong towers of King Ben-Hadad.”
Jeremiah,49,28,"Here is what the Lord says about the people of Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor. Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, was planning to attack them. The Lord says to the armies of Babylon, “Prepare for battle. Attack Kedar. Destroy the people of the east."
Jeremiah,49,29,"Their tents and flocks will be taken away from them. Their tents will be carried off. All their goods and camels will be stolen. People will shout to them, ‘There is terror on every side!’"
Jeremiah,49,30,"“Run away quickly! You who live in Hazor, stay in deep caves,” announces the Lord. “Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, has made plans against you. He has decided to attack you."
Jeremiah,49,31,"“Armies of Babylon, prepare for battle. Attack a nation that feels secure. Its people do not have any worries,” announces the Lord. “That nation does not have gates or bars that lock them. Its people live far from danger."
Jeremiah,49,32,"Their camels will be stolen. Their large herds will be taken away. I will scatter to the winds those who are in places far away. I will bring trouble on them from every side,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,49,33,“Hazor will become a home for wild dogs. It will be a dry and empty desert forever. No one will live in that land. No human beings will stay there.”
Jeremiah,49,34,A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet. It was about Elam. It came shortly after Zedekiah became king of Judah.
Jeremiah,49,35,"The Lord who rules over all said, “Elam’s bow is the secret of its strength. But I will break it."
Jeremiah,49,36,I will bring the four winds against Elam. I will bring them from all four directions. I will scatter Elam’s people to the four winds. They will be taken away to every nation on earth.
Jeremiah,49,37,"I will use Elam’s enemies to smash them. Those who want to kill them will kill them. I will bring trouble on Elam’s people. My anger will be great against them,” announces the Lord. “I will chase them with swords. I will hunt them down until I have destroyed them."
Jeremiah,49,38,"I will set up my throne in Elam. I will destroy its king and officials,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,49,39,"“But in days to come I will bless Elam with great success again,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,50,1,"Here is the message the Lord spoke through Jeremiah the prophet. It was about the city of Babylon and the land of Babylon. He said,"
Jeremiah,50,2,"“Announce this message among the nations. Lift up a banner. Let the nations hear the message. Do not keep anything back. Say, ‘Babylon will be captured. The god named Bel will be put to shame. The god named Marduk will be filled with terror. Babylon’s gods will be put to shame. The gods its people made will be filled with terror.’"
Jeremiah,50,3,A nation from the north will attack it. That nation will destroy Babylon. No one will live there. People and animals alike will run away.
Jeremiah,50,4,"“The days are coming,” announces the Lord. “At that time the people of Israel and Judah will gather together. They will come in tears to me. I am the Lord their God."

Jeremiah,50,6,“My people have been like lost sheep. Their shepherds have led them astray. They have caused them to wander in the mountains. They have wandered over mountains and hills. They have forgotten that I am their true resting place.

Jeremiah,50,8,"“People of Judah, run away from Babylon. Leave the land of Babylon. Be like the goats that lead the flock."
Jeremiah,50,9,I will stir up great nations that will join forces against Babylon. I will bring them from the land of the north. They will take up their battle positions against Babylon. They will come from the north and capture it. Their arrows will be like skilled soldiers. They will not miss their mark.
Jeremiah,50,10,"So the riches of Babylon will be taken away. All those who steal from it will have more than enough,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,50,11,"“People of Babylon, you have stolen what belongs to me. That has made you glad and full of joy. You dance around like a young cow on a threshing floor. You neigh like stallions."
Jeremiah,50,12,"Because of that, you will bring great shame on your land. Your whole nation will be dishonored. It will become the least important of the nations. It will become a dry and empty desert."

Jeremiah,50,14,"“All you who shoot arrows, take up your battle positions around Babylon. Shoot at it! Do not spare any arrows! Its people have sinned against me."
Jeremiah,50,15,Shout against them on every side! They are giving up. The towers of the city are falling. Its walls are being pulled down. The Lord is paying back its people. So pay them back yourselves. Do to them what they have done to others.
Jeremiah,50,16,"Do not leave anyone in Babylon to plant the fields. Do not leave anyone to harvest the grain. Let each of them return to their own people. Let them run away to their own land. If they don’t, their enemy’s sword will bring them great harm."
Jeremiah,50,17,"“Israel is like a scattered flock that lions have chased away. The first lion that ate them up was the king of Assyria. The last one that broke their bones was Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon.”"

Jeremiah,50,19,But I will bring Israel back to their own grasslands. I will feed them on Mount Carmel and in Bashan. I will satisfy their hunger on the hills of Ephraim and Gilead.
Jeremiah,50,20,"The days are coming,” announces the Lord. “At that time people will search for Israel’s guilt. But they will not find any. They will search for Judah’s sins. But they will not find any. That is because I will forgive the people I have spared."
Jeremiah,50,21,"“Enemies of Babylon, attack their land of Merathaim. Make war against those who live in Pekod. Chase them and kill them. Destroy them completely,” announces the Lord. “Do everything I have commanded you to do."
Jeremiah,50,22,The noise of battle is heard in the land. It is the noise of a great city being destroyed!
Jeremiah,50,23,It has been broken to pieces. It was the hammer that broke the whole earth. How empty Babylon is among the nations!
Jeremiah,50,24,"Babylon, I set a trap for you. And you were caught before you knew it. You were found and captured. That is because you opposed me."
Jeremiah,50,25,I have opened up my storeroom. I have brought out the weapons I use when I am angry. I am the Lord and King who rules over all. I have work to do in the land of the Babylonians.
Jeremiah,50,26,So come against it from far away. Open up its storerooms. Stack everything up like piles of grain. Completely destroy that country. Do not leave anyone alive there.
Jeremiah,50,27,Kill all Babylon’s strongest warriors. Let them die in battle. How terrible it will be for them! Their time to be judged has come. Now they will be punished.
Jeremiah,50,28,Listen to those who have escaped. Listen to those who have returned from Babylon. They are announcing in Zion how I have paid Babylon back. I have paid it back for destroying my temple.
Jeremiah,50,29,“Send for men armed with bows and arrows. Send them against Babylon. Set up camp all around it. Do not let anyone escape. Pay it back for what its people have done. Do to them what they have done to others. They have dared to disobey me. I am the Holy One of Israel.

Jeremiah,50,32,You proud people will trip and fall. No one will help you up. I will start a fire in your towns. It will burn up everyone around you.”
Jeremiah,50,33,"The Lord who rules over all says, “The people of Israel are being treated badly. So are the people of Judah. Those who have captured them are holding them. They refuse to let them go."
Jeremiah,50,34,But I am strong and will save them. My name is the Lord Who Rules Over All. I will stand up for them. I will bring peace and rest to their land. But I will bring trouble to those who live in Babylon.
Jeremiah,50,35,“A sword is coming against the Babylonians!” announces the Lord. “It is coming against those who live in Babylon. It is coming against their officials and wise men.

Jeremiah,50,37,A sword is coming against their horses and chariots! It is coming against all the hired soldiers in their armies. They will become weak. A sword is coming against their treasures! They will be stolen.
Jeremiah,50,38,There will not be any rain for their rivers. So they will dry up. Those things will happen because their land is full of statues of gods. Those gods will go crazy with terror.

Jeremiah,50,42,"Their soldiers are armed with bows and spears. They are mean. They do not show any mercy at all. They come riding in on their horses. They sound like the roaring ocean. They are lined up for battle. They are coming to attack you, city of Babylon."
Jeremiah,50,43,The king of Babylon has heard reports about them. His hands can’t help him. He is in great pain. It is like the pain of a woman having a baby.
Jeremiah,50,44,I will be like a lion coming up from the bushes by the Jordan River. I will hunt in rich grasslands. I will chase the people of Babylon from their land in an instant. What nation will I choose to do this? Which one will I appoint? Is anyone like me? Who would dare to argue with me? What leader can stand against me?”
Jeremiah,50,45,So listen to what the Lord has planned against Babylon. Hear what he has planned against the land of the Babylonians. Their young people will be dragged away. Their grasslands will be shocked at their fate.

Jeremiah,51,8,Babylon will suddenly fall and be broken. Weep for it! Get healing lotion for its pain. Perhaps it can be healed.
Jeremiah,51,9,"“The nations say, ‘We would have healed Babylon. But it can’t be healed. So let’s leave it. Let’s each go to our own land. Babylon’s sins reach all the way to the skies. They rise up as high as the heavens.’"

Jeremiah,51,29,The Babylonians tremble and shake with fear. My plans against them stand firm. I plan to destroy their land completely. Then no one will live there.
Jeremiah,51,30,Babylon’s soldiers have stopped fighting. They remain in their forts. Their strength is all gone. They have become weak. Their buildings are set on fire. The metal bars that lock their gates are broken.
Jeremiah,51,31,One messenger after another comes to the king of Babylon. All of them announce that his entire city is captured.

Jeremiah,51,34,"The people of Jerusalem say, “Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, has destroyed us. He has thrown us into a panic. He has emptied us out like a jar. Like a snake he has swallowed us up. He has filled his stomach with our rich food. Then he has spit us out of his mouth.”"
Jeremiah,51,35,"The people continue, “May the people of Babylon pay for the harmful things they have done to us. May those who live in Babylon pay for spilling the blood of our people.” That’s what the people who live in Zion say."
Jeremiah,51,36,"So the Lord says, “I will stand up for you. I will pay the Babylonians back for what they did to you. I will dry up their water supply. I will make their springs run dry."
Jeremiah,51,37,Babylon will have all its buildings knocked down. It will be a home for wild dogs. No one will live there. People will be shocked at it. They will make fun of it.
Jeremiah,51,38,All its people roar like young lions. They growl like lion cubs.

Jeremiah,51,42,Babylon’s enemies will sweep over it like an ocean. Like roaring waves they will cover it.
Jeremiah,51,43,The towns of Babylon will be empty. It will become a dry and desert land. No one will live there. No one will even travel through it.

And you will hear something else next year. You will hear about awful things in the land. You will hear about one ruler fighting against another.
Jeremiah,51,47,I will punish the gods of Babylon. That time will certainly come. Then the whole land will be full of shame. Its people will lie down and die there.
Jeremiah,51,48,"So heaven and earth and everything in them will shout for joy. They will be glad because of what will happen to Babylon. Armies will attack it from the north. And they will destroy it,” announces the Lord."
Jeremiah,51,49,“Babylon’s people have killed my people Israel. They have also killed people all over the earth. So now Babylon itself must fall.
Jeremiah,51,50,"You who have not been killed in the war against Babylon, leave! Do not wait! In a land far away remember me. And think about Jerusalem.”"
Jeremiah,51,51,"The people of Judah reply, “No one honors us anymore. People make fun of us. Our faces are covered with shame. People from other lands have entered the holy places of the Lord ’s house.”"
Jeremiah,51,52,"“But the days are coming,” announces the Lord. “At that time I will punish the gods of Babylon. And all through its land wounded people will groan."
Jeremiah,51,53,"What if Babylon reached all the way to the heavens? What if it made its high walls even stronger? I would still send destroyers against it,” announces the Lord."

Jeremiah,51,56,A destroying army will come against Babylon. The soldiers in the city will be captured. Their bows will be broken. I am the Lord God who pays people back. I will pay them back in full.
Jeremiah,51,57,"I will make Babylon’s officials and wise men drunk. I will do the same thing to its governors, officers and soldiers. They will lie down and die. They will never wake up,” announces the King. His name is the Lord Who Rules Over All."
Jeremiah,51,58,"The Lord who rules over all says, “Babylon’s thick walls will fall down flat. Its high gates will be set on fire. The nations wear themselves out for no reason at all. Their hard work will only be burned up in the flames.”"
Jeremiah,51,59,"Jeremiah the prophet gave a message to the staff officer Seraiah, the son of Neriah. Neriah was the son of Mahseiah. Jeremiah told Seraiah to take the message with him to Babylon. Seraiah went there with Zedekiah, the king of Judah. He left in the fourth year of Zedekiah’s rule."
Jeremiah,51,60,Jeremiah had written about all the trouble that would come on Babylon. He had written it down on a scroll. It included everything that had been recorded about Babylon.
Jeremiah,51,61,"Jeremiah said to Seraiah, “When you get to Babylon, here’s what I want you to do. Make sure that you read all these words out loud."
Jeremiah,51,62,"Then say, ‘ Lord , you have said you will destroy this place. You have said that no people or animals will live here. It will be empty forever.’"
Jeremiah,51,63,Finish reading the scroll. Tie a stone to it. Throw it into the Euphrates River.
Jeremiah,51,64,"Then say, ‘In the same way, Babylon will sink down. It will never rise again. That is because I will bring such horrible trouble on it. And its people will fall along with it.’ ” The words of Jeremiah end here."
Jeremiah,52,1,Zedekiah was 21 years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for 11 years. His mother’s name was Hamutal. She was the daughter of Jeremiah. She was from Libnah.
Jeremiah,52,2,Zedekiah did what was evil in the eyes of the Lord . He did just as Jehoiakim had done.
Jeremiah,52,3,The enemies of Jerusalem and Judah attacked them because the Lord was angry. In the end he threw them out of his land. Zedekiah refused to obey the king of Babylon.
Jeremiah,52,4,Nebuchadnezzar was the king of Babylon. He marched out against Jerusalem. All his armies went with him. It was in the ninth year of the rule of Zedekiah. It was on the tenth day of the tenth month. The armies set up camp outside the city. They set up ladders and built ramps and towers all around it.
Jeremiah,52,5,It was surrounded until the 11th year of King Zedekiah’s rule.
Jeremiah,52,6,"By the ninth day of the fourth month, there wasn’t any food left in the city. So the people didn’t have anything to eat."
Jeremiah,52,7,Then the Babylonians broke through the city wall. Judah’s whole army ran away. They left the city at night. They went out through the gate between the two walls that were near the king’s garden. They escaped even though the Babylonians surrounded the city. Judah’s army ran toward the Arabah Valley.
Jeremiah,52,8,But the armies of Babylon chased King Zedekiah. They caught up with him in the plains near Jericho. All his soldiers were separated from him. They had scattered in every direction.
Jeremiah,52,9,The king was captured. He was taken to the king of Babylon at Riblah. Riblah was in the land of Hamath. That’s where Nebuchadnezzar decided how Zedekiah would be punished.
Jeremiah,52,10,At Riblah the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah. He forced him to watch it with his own eyes. Nebuchadnezzar also killed all the officials of Judah.
Jeremiah,52,11,Then he poked out Zedekiah’s eyes. He put him in bronze chains. And he took him to Babylon. There he put Zedekiah in prison until the day he died.
Jeremiah,52,12,"Nebuzaradan served the king of Babylon. In fact, he was commander of the royal guard. He came to Jerusalem. It was in the 19th year that Nebuchadnezzar was king of Babylon. It was on the tenth day of the fifth month."
Jeremiah,52,13,Nebuzaradan set the Lord ’s temple on fire. He also set fire to the royal palace and all the houses in Jerusalem. He burned down every important building.
Jeremiah,52,14,The armies of Babylon broke down all the walls around Jerusalem. That’s what the commander told them to do.
Jeremiah,52,15,Some of the poorest people still remained in the city along with the others. But the commander Nebuzaradan took them away as prisoners. He also took the rest of the skilled workers. That included the people who had joined the king of Babylon.
Jeremiah,52,16,But Nebuzaradan left the rest of the poorest people of the land behind. He told them to work in the vineyards and fields.
Jeremiah,52,17,The armies of Babylon destroyed the Lord ’s temple. They broke the bronze pillars into pieces. They broke up the bronze stands that could be moved around. And they broke up the huge bronze bowl. Then they carried away all the bronze to Babylon.
Jeremiah,52,18,"They also took away the pots, shovels, wick cutters, sprinkling bowls and dishes. They took away all the bronze objects that were used for any purpose in the temple."
Jeremiah,52,19,"The commander of the royal guard took away the bowls and the shallow cups for burning incense. He took away the sprinkling bowls, the pots, the lampstands and the dishes. He took away the bowls used for drink offerings. So he took away everything made out of pure gold or silver."
Jeremiah,52,20,The bronze was more than anyone could weigh. It included the bronze from the two pillars. It included the bronze from the huge bowl and the 12 bronze bulls under it. It also included the stands. King Solomon had made all those things for the Lord ’s temple.
Jeremiah,52,21,Each pillar was 27 feet high and 18 feet around. The pillars were hollow. The metal in each of them was three inches thick.
Jeremiah,52,22,The bronze top of one pillar was seven and a half feet high. It was decorated with a set of bronze chains and pomegranates all around it. The other pillar was just like it. It also had pomegranates.
Jeremiah,52,23,There were 96 pomegranates on the sides of each of the two tops. The total number of pomegranates above the bronze chains around each top was 100.
Jeremiah,52,24,The commander of the guard took many prisoners. They included Seraiah the chief priest and Zephaniah the priest who reported to him. They also included the three men who guarded the temple doors.
Jeremiah,52,25,Some people were still left in the city. The commander took as a prisoner the officer in charge of the fighting men. He took the seven men who gave advice to the king. He also took the secretary who was the chief officer in charge of getting the people of the land to serve in the army. There were 60 people of the land still in the city.
Jeremiah,52,26,The commander Nebuzaradan took all of them away. He brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
Jeremiah,52,27,There the king had them put to death. Riblah was in the land of Hamath. So the people of Judah were taken as prisoners. They were taken far away from their own land.
Jeremiah,52,28,"Here is the number of the people Nebuchadnezzar took to Babylon as prisoners. In the seventh year of his rule, he took 3,023 Jews."
Jeremiah,52,29,"In his 18th year, he took 832 people from Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,52,30,"In Nebuchadnezzar’s 23rd year, Nebuzaradan, the commander of the royal guard, took 745 Jews to Babylon. The total number of people taken to Babylon was 4,600."
Jeremiah,52,31,"Awel-Marduk set Jehoiachin, the king of Judah, free from prison. It was in the 37th year after Jehoiachin had been taken away to Babylon. It was also the year Awel-Marduk became king of Babylon. It was on the 25th day of the 12th month."
Jeremiah,52,32,Awel-Marduk spoke kindly to Jehoiachin. He gave him a place of honor. Other kings were with Jehoiachin in Babylon. But his place was more important than theirs.
Jeremiah,52,33,So Jehoiachin put away his prison clothes. For the rest of Jehoiachin’s life the king of Babylon provided what he needed.
Jeremiah,52,34,The king did that for Jehoiachin day by day as long as he lived. He did it until the day Jehoiachin died.
