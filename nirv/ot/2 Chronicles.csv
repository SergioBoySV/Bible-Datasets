2 Chronicles,1,1,Solomon was the son of David. Solomon made his position secure over his kingdom. The Lord his God was with him. He made Solomon very great.
2 Chronicles,1,2,Solomon spoke to the whole community of Israel. He spoke to the commanders of thousands of men and commanders of hundreds. He spoke to the judges and all the leaders in Israel. He spoke to the leaders of Israel’s families.
2 Chronicles,1,3,Solomon and the whole community went to the high place at Gibeon. That’s because God’s tent of meeting was there. The Lord ’s servant Moses had made the tent in the desert.
2 Chronicles,1,4,David had carried up the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim. He had it brought to the place he had prepared for it. He had set up a tent for it in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,1,5,But the bronze altar that Bezalel had made was in Gibeon. Bezalel was the son of Uri. Uri was the son of Hur. The altar was in front of the Lord ’s holy tent. So Solomon and the whole community asked the Lord for advice in Gibeon.
2 Chronicles,1,6,"Solomon went up to the bronze altar in front of the Lord at the tent of meeting. Solomon sacrificed 1,000 burnt offerings on the altar."
2 Chronicles,1,7,"That night God appeared to Solomon. He said to him, “Ask for anything you want me to give you.”"
2 Chronicles,1,8,"Solomon answered God, “You were very kind to my father David. Now you have made me king in his place."
2 Chronicles,1,9,"Lord God, let the promise you gave to my father David come true. You have made me king. My people are as many as the dust of the earth. They can’t be counted."
2 Chronicles,1,10,"Give me wisdom and knowledge. Then I’ll be able to lead these people. Without your help, who would be able to rule this great nation of yours?”"
2 Chronicles,1,11,"God said to Solomon, “I am glad that those are the things you really want. You have not asked for wealth, possessions or honor. You have not even asked to have your enemies killed. You have not asked to live for a long time. Instead, you have asked for wisdom and knowledge. You want to be able to rule my people wisely. I have made you king over them."
2 Chronicles,1,12,"So wisdom and knowledge will be given to you. I will also give you wealth, possessions and honor. You will have more than any king before you ever had. And no king after you will have as much.”"
2 Chronicles,1,13,Then Solomon left the high place at Gibeon. He went from the tent of meeting there to Jerusalem. And he ruled over Israel.
2 Chronicles,1,14,"Solomon had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horses. He kept some of them in the chariot cities. He kept others with him in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,1,15,The king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stones. He made cedar wood as common there as sycamore-fig trees in the western hills.
2 Chronicles,1,16,Solomon got horses from Egypt and Kue. The king’s buyers purchased them from Kue at the current price.
2 Chronicles,1,17,They could get a chariot from Egypt for 15 pounds of silver. They could get a horse for less than four pounds of silver. They sold horses and chariots to all the Hittite and Aramean kings.
2 Chronicles,2,1,Solomon gave orders to build a temple. That’s where the Lord would put his Name. Solomon also gave orders to build a royal palace for himself.
2 Chronicles,2,2,"He chose 70,000 men to carry things. He chose 80,000 to cut stones in the hills. He put 3,600 men in charge of them."
2 Chronicles,2,3,"Solomon sent a message to Hiram. Hiram was king of Tyre. Solomon said, “Send me cedar logs, just as you did for my father David. You sent him cedar to build a palace to live in."
2 Chronicles,2,4,Now I’m about to build a temple. The Name of the Lord my God will be there. I’ll set the temple apart for him. Sweet-smelling incense will be burned in front of him there. The holy bread will be set out at regular times. Burnt offerings will be sacrificed there every morning and evening. They will be sacrificed every Sabbath day. They will be sacrificed at every New Moon feast. And they will be sacrificed at every yearly appointed feast of the Lord our God. That’s a law for Israel that will last for all time to come.
2 Chronicles,2,5,“The temple I’m going to build will be beautiful. That’s because our God is greater than all other gods.
2 Chronicles,2,6,"So who is able to build a temple for him? After all, the heavens can’t hold him. In fact, not even the highest heavens can hold him. So who am I to build a temple for him? It will only be a place to burn sacrifices in front of him."
2 Chronicles,2,7,"“Send me a man skilled at working with gold, silver, bronze and iron. He must also be able to work with purple, blue and bright red yarn. He must be skilled in the art of carving. Send him to work in Judah and Jerusalem with my skilled workers. My father David provided them to help me."
2 Chronicles,2,8,"“Also send me cedar, juniper and algum logs from Lebanon. I know that your servants are skilled in cutting wood there. My servants will work with yours."
2 Chronicles,2,9,They’ll provide me with plenty of lumber. That’s because the temple I’m building must be large and beautiful.
2 Chronicles,2,10,"I’ll pay your servants. They will cut the wood. I’ll pay them 3,600 tons of wheat that has been ground up. I’ll pay them 3,000 tons of barley. I’ll also pay them 120,000 gallons of wine and 120,000 gallons of olive oil.”"
2 Chronicles,2,11,"King Hiram of Tyre replied to Solomon. He wrote a letter to him. In it Hiram said, “The Lord loves his people. That’s why he has made you their king.”"
2 Chronicles,2,12,"Hiram continued, “I praise the Lord . He is the God of Israel. He made heaven and earth. He has given King David a wise son. You have good sense. You understand what is right. You will build a temple for the Lord . You will also build a palace for yourself."
2 Chronicles,2,13,“I’m sending Huram-Abi to you. He is very skillful.
2 Chronicles,2,14,"His mother was from Dan. His father was from Tyre. He is trained to work with gold, silver, bronze and iron. He knows how to work with stone and wood. He can also work with purple, blue and bright red yarn and fine linen. He’s skilled in all kinds of carving. He can follow any pattern you give him. He’ll work with your skilled workers. He’ll also work with those of your father David. David was my master."
2 Chronicles,2,15,"“Now please send us what you promised. Send us the wheat, barley, olive oil and wine."
2 Chronicles,2,16,And we’ll cut all the logs from Lebanon that you need. We’ll make rafts out of them. We’ll float them by sea down to Joppa. Then you can take them up to Jerusalem.”
2 Chronicles,2,17,"Solomon counted all the outsiders who were living in Israel. He did it after his father David had counted them. There were 153,600 of them."
2 Chronicles,2,18,"He chose 70,000 to carry things. He chose 80,000 to cut stones in the hills. He put 3,600 men in charge of the people to keep them working."
2 Chronicles,3,1,Then Solomon began to build the temple of the Lord . He built it on Mount Moriah in Jerusalem. That’s where the Lord had appeared to Solomon’s father David. The Lord had appeared at the threshing floor of Araunah. Araunah was from Jebus. David had provided the threshing floor.
2 Chronicles,3,2,Solomon began building the temple on the second day of the second month. It was in the fourth year of his rule.
2 Chronicles,3,3,Solomon laid the foundation for God’s temple. It was 90 feet long and 30 feet wide. Solomon’s men followed the standard measure used at that time.
2 Chronicles,3,4,The porch in front of the temple was 30 feet across and 30 feet high. Solomon covered the inside of the temple with pure gold.
2 Chronicles,3,5,He covered the inside of the main hall with juniper boards. Then he covered the boards with fine gold. He decorated the hall with palm tree patterns and chain patterns.
2 Chronicles,3,6,He decorated the temple with valuable jewels. The gold he used came from Parvaim.
2 Chronicles,3,7,"He covered the ceiling beams, doorframes, walls and doors of the temple with gold. He carved cherubim on the walls."
2 Chronicles,3,8,He built the Most Holy Room. It was as long as the temple was wide. It was 30 feet long and 30 feet wide. He covered the inside of the Most Holy Room with 23 tons of fine gold.
2 Chronicles,3,9,He also covered the upper parts with gold. The gold on the nails weighed 20 ounces.
2 Chronicles,3,10,"For the Most Holy Room, Solomon made a pair of carved cherubim. He covered them with gold."
2 Chronicles,3,11,The total length of the cherubim’s wings from tip to tip was 30 feet. One wing of the first cherub was seven and a half feet long. Its tip touched the temple wall. The other wing was also seven and a half feet long. Its tip touched the wing tip of the other cherub.
2 Chronicles,3,12,In the same way one wing of the second cherub was seven and a half feet long. Its tip touched the other temple wall. The other wing was also seven and a half feet long. Its tip touched the wing tip of the first cherub.
2 Chronicles,3,13,So the total length of the wings of the two cherubim was 30 feet from tip to tip. The cherubim stood facing the main hall.
2 Chronicles,3,14,"Solomon made the curtain out of blue, purple and bright red yarn and fine linen. A skilled worker sewed cherubim into its pattern."
2 Chronicles,3,15,"For the front of the temple, Solomon made two pillars. Each pillar was 26 feet tall. Each had a decorated top seven and a half feet high."
2 Chronicles,3,16,Solomon made chains that were linked together. He put them on top of the pillars. He also made 100 pomegranates. He fastened them to the chains.
2 Chronicles,3,17,Solomon set the pillars up in front of the temple. One was on the south. The other was on the north. He named the one on the south Jakin. The one on the north he named Boaz.
2 Chronicles,4,1,"Solomon made a bronze altar 30 feet long, 30 feet wide and 15 feet high."
2 Chronicles,4,2,He made a huge metal bowl for washing. Its shape was round. It measured 15 feet from rim to rim. It was seven and a half feet high. And it was 45 feet around.
2 Chronicles,4,3,Below the rim there was a circle of bull figures around the bowl. In every 18 inches around the bowl there were ten bulls. The bulls were arranged in two rows. They were made as part of the bowl itself.
2 Chronicles,4,4,The bowl stood on 12 bulls. Three of them faced north. Three faced west. Three faced south. And three faced east. The bowl rested on top of them. Their rear ends were toward the center.
2 Chronicles,4,5,"The bowl was three inches thick. Its rim was like the rim of a cup. The rim was shaped like the bloom of a lily. The bowl held 18,000 gallons of water."
2 Chronicles,4,6,Solomon made ten smaller bowls for washing. He placed five of them on the south side of the huge bowl. He placed the other five on the north side. The things used for the burnt offerings were rinsed in the smaller bowls. But the priests used the huge bowl for washing.
2 Chronicles,4,7,Solomon made ten gold lampstands. He followed the pattern the Lord had given him. He placed the lampstands in the temple. He put five of them on the south side. He put the other five on the north side.
2 Chronicles,4,8,He made ten tables. He placed them in the temple. He put five of them on the south side. He put the other five on the north side. He also made 100 gold sprinkling bowls.
2 Chronicles,4,9,He made the courtyard of the priests. He also made the large courtyard. He made doors for it. He covered the doors with bronze.
2 Chronicles,4,10,He placed the huge bowl on the south side of the courtyard. He put it at the southeast corner.
2 Chronicles,4,11,"And Huram also made the pots, shovels and sprinkling bowls. So Huram finished the work he had started for King Solomon. Here’s what he made for God’s temple."
2 Chronicles,4,12,He made the two pillars. He made the two tops for the pillars. The tops were shaped like bowls. He made the two sets of chains that were linked together. They decorated the two bowl-shaped tops of the pillars.
2 Chronicles,4,13,He made the 400 pomegranates for the two sets of chains. There were two rows of pomegranates for each chain. They decorated the bowl-shaped tops of the pillars.
2 Chronicles,4,14,He made the stands and their bowls.
2 Chronicles,4,15,He made the huge bowl. He made the 12 bulls that were under it.
2 Chronicles,4,16,"He made the pots, shovels and meat forks. He also made all the things used with them. Huram-Abi made all these objects for King Solomon for the Lord ’s temple. He made them out of bronze. Then he shined them up."
2 Chronicles,4,17,The king had them made in clay molds. It was done on the plains of the Jordan River between Sukkoth and Zarethan.
2 Chronicles,4,18,"Solomon made huge numbers of these things. There were too many of them to weigh. In fact, it was impossible to add up the weight of all the bronze."
2 Chronicles,4,19,Solomon also made all the objects that were in God’s temple. He made the golden altar. He made the tables for the holy bread.
2 Chronicles,4,20,"He made the pure gold lampstands and their lamps. The lamps burned in front of the Most Holy Room, just as the law required."
2 Chronicles,4,21,He made the gold flowers. He made the gold lamps and tongs. They were made out of solid gold.
2 Chronicles,4,22,"He made the wick cutters, sprinkling bowls, dishes, and shallow cups for burning incense. All of them were made out of pure gold. He made the gold doors of the temple. They were the inner doors to the Most Holy Room and the doors of the main hall."
2 Chronicles,5,1,Solomon finished all the work for the Lord ’s temple. Then he brought in the things his father David had set apart for the Lord . They included the silver and gold and all the objects for God’s temple. Solomon placed them there with the other treasures.
2 Chronicles,5,2,Then Solomon sent for the elders of Israel. He told them to come to Jerusalem. They included all the leaders of the tribes. They also included the chiefs of the families of Israel. Solomon wanted them to bring up the ark of the Lord ’s covenant from Zion. Zion was the City of David.
2 Chronicles,5,3,All the Israelites came together to where the king was. It was at the time of the Feast of Booths. The feast was held in the seventh month.
2 Chronicles,5,4,All the elders of Israel arrived. Then the Levites picked up the ark and carried it.
2 Chronicles,5,5,"They brought up the ark. They also brought up the tent of meeting and all the sacred things in the tent. The priests, who were Levites, carried up everything."
2 Chronicles,5,6,"The entire community of Israel had gathered around King Solomon. All of them were in front of the ark. They sacrificed huge numbers of sheep and cattle. There were so many animals that they couldn’t be recorded. In fact, they couldn’t even be counted."
2 Chronicles,5,7,The priests brought the ark of the Lord ’s covenant to its place in the Most Holy Room of the temple. They put it under the wings of the cherubim.
2 Chronicles,5,8,The cherubim’s wings were spread out over the place where the ark was. They covered the ark. They also covered the poles used to carry it.
2 Chronicles,5,9,The poles reached out from the ark. They were so long that their ends could be seen from in front of the Most Holy Room. But they couldn’t be seen from outside the Holy Room. They are still there to this day.
2 Chronicles,5,10,There wasn’t anything in the ark except the two tablets. Moses had placed them in it at Mount Horeb. That’s where the Lord had made a covenant with the Israelites. He made it after they came out of Egypt.
2 Chronicles,5,11,The priests left the Holy Room. All the priests who were there had set themselves apart to the Lord . It didn’t matter what group they were in.
2 Chronicles,5,12,"All the Levites who played music stood near the east side of the altar. They included Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun and their sons and relatives. They were dressed in fine linen. They were playing cymbals, harps and lyres. They were joined by 120 priests who were blowing trumpets."
2 Chronicles,5,13,"The trumpet players and other musicians played their instruments together. They praised the Lord and gave thanks to him. The singers sang to the music of the trumpets, cymbals and other instruments. They sang in praise to the Lord, “The Lord is good. His faithful love continues forever.” Then a cloud filled the temple of the Lord."
2 Chronicles,5,14,The priests couldn’t do their work. That’s because the cloud of the Lord ’s glory filled God’s temple.
2 Chronicles,6,1,"Then Solomon said, “ Lord , you have said you would live in a dark cloud."
2 Chronicles,6,2,I’ve built a beautiful temple for you. You can live in it forever.”
2 Chronicles,6,3,The whole community of Israel was standing there. The king turned around and gave them his blessing.
2 Chronicles,6,4,"Then he said, “I praise the Lord . He is the God of Israel. With his mouth he made a promise to my father David. With his powerful hands he made it come true. He said,"
2 Chronicles,6,5,"‘I brought my people out of Egypt. Since then, a temple for my Name has not been built. I have not chosen a city in any tribe of Israel for that purpose. And I have not chosen anyone to be ruler over my people Israel."
2 Chronicles,6,6,But now I have chosen Jerusalem. I will put my Name there. And I have chosen David to rule over my people Israel.’
2 Chronicles,6,7,“With all his heart my father David wanted to build a temple. He wanted to do it so the Name of the Lord could be there. The Lord is the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles,6,8,"But the Lord spoke to my father David. He said, ‘With all your heart you wanted to build a temple for my Name. It is good that you wanted to do that."
2 Chronicles,6,9,"But you will not build the temple. Instead, your son will build the temple for my Name. He is your own flesh and blood.’"
2 Chronicles,6,10,“The Lord has kept the promise he made. I’ve become the next king after my father David. Now I’m sitting on the throne of Israel. That’s exactly what the Lord promised would happen. I’ve built the temple for the Name of the Lord . He is the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles,6,11,I’ve placed the ark there. The tablets of the Lord ’s covenant are inside it. He made that covenant with the people of Israel.”
2 Chronicles,6,12,Then Solomon stood in front of the Lord ’s altar. He stood in front of the whole community of Israel. He spread out his hands to pray.
2 Chronicles,6,13,He had made a bronze stage. It was seven and a half feet long and seven and a half feet wide. It was four and a half feet high. He had placed it in the center of the outer courtyard. He stood on the stage. Then he got down on his knees in front of the whole community of Israel. He spread out his hands toward heaven.
2 Chronicles,6,14,"He said, “ Lord , you are the God of Israel. There is no God like you in heaven or on earth. You keep the covenant you made with us. You show us your love. You do that when we follow you with all our hearts."
2 Chronicles,6,15,You have kept your promise to my father David. He was your servant. With your mouth you made a promise. With your powerful hand you have made it come true. And today we can see it.
2 Chronicles,6,16,"“ Lord , you are the God of Israel. Keep the promises you made to my father David. Do it for him. He was your servant. You said to him, ‘You will always have a son from your family line to sit on Israel’s throne. He will sit in front of the Most Holy Room, where my own throne is. That will be true only if your children after you are careful in everything they do. They must live the way my law tells them to. That is the way you have lived.’"
2 Chronicles,6,17,"Lord , you are the God of Israel. So let your promise to your servant David come true."
2 Chronicles,6,18,"“But will God really live on earth with human beings? After all, the heavens can’t hold you. In fact, even the highest heavens can’t hold you. So this temple I’ve built certainly can’t hold you!"
2 Chronicles,6,19,"But please pay attention to my prayer. Lord my God, be ready to help me as I make my appeal to you. Listen to my cry for help. Hear the prayer I’m praying to you."
2 Chronicles,6,20,Let your eyes look toward this temple day and night. You said you would put your Name here. Listen to the prayer I’m praying toward this place.
2 Chronicles,6,21,"Hear me when I ask you to help us. Listen to your people Israel when they pray toward this place. Listen to us from heaven. It’s the place where you live. When you hear us, forgive us."
2 Chronicles,6,22,“Suppose someone does something wrong to their neighbor. And the person who has done something wrong is required to give their word. They must tell the truth about what they have done. They must come and do it in front of your altar in this temple.
2 Chronicles,6,23,"When they do, listen to them from heaven. Take action. Judge between the person and their neighbor. Pay back the guilty one. Do to them what they have done to their neighbor. Deal with the one who isn’t guilty in a way that shows they are free from blame. That will prove they aren’t guilty."
2 Chronicles,6,24,“Suppose your people Israel have lost the battle against their enemies. And suppose they’ve sinned against you. But they turn back to you and praise your name. They pray to you in this temple. And they ask you to help them.
2 Chronicles,6,25,Then listen to them from heaven. Forgive the sin of your people Israel. Bring them back to the land you gave to them and their people who lived long ago.
2 Chronicles,6,26,"“Suppose your people have sinned against you. And because of that, the sky is closed up and there isn’t any rain. But your people pray toward this place. They praise you by admitting they’ve sinned. And they turn away from their sin because you have made them suffer."
2 Chronicles,6,27,Then listen to them from heaven. Forgive the sin of your people Israel. Teach them the right way to live. Send rain on the land you gave them as their share.
2 Chronicles,6,28,“Suppose there isn’t enough food in the land. And a plague strikes the land. The hot winds completely dry up our crops. Or locusts or grasshoppers come and eat them up. Or enemies surround one of our cities and get ready to attack it. Or trouble or sickness comes.
2 Chronicles,6,29,But suppose one of your people prays to you. They ask you to help them. They are aware of how much they are suffering. And they spread out their hands toward this temple to pray.
2 Chronicles,6,30,"Then listen to them from heaven. It’s the place where you live. Forgive them. Deal with everyone in keeping with everything they do. You know their hearts. In fact, you are the only one who knows every human heart."
2 Chronicles,6,31,Your people will have respect for you. They will live the way you want them to. They’ll live that way as long as they are in the land you gave our people long ago.
2 Chronicles,6,32,“Suppose an outsider who doesn’t belong to your people Israel has come from a land far away. They have come because they’ve heard about your great name. They have heard that you reached out your mighty hand and powerful arm. So they come and pray toward this temple.
2 Chronicles,6,33,Then listen to them from heaven. It’s the place where you live. Do what that outsider asks you to do. Then all the nations on earth will know you. They will have respect for you. They’ll respect you just as your own people Israel do. They’ll know that your Name is in this house I’ve built.
2 Chronicles,6,34,“Suppose your people go to war against their enemies. It doesn’t matter where you send them. And suppose they pray to you toward this city you have chosen. They pray toward the temple I’ve built for your Name.
2 Chronicles,6,35,Then listen to them from heaven. Listen to their prayer. Listen to them when they ask you to help them. Stand up for them.
2 Chronicles,6,36,"“Suppose they sin against you. After all, there isn’t anyone who doesn’t sin. And suppose you get angry with them. You hand them over to their enemies. They take them as prisoners to another land. It doesn’t matter whether that land is near or far away."
2 Chronicles,6,37,"But suppose your people change their ways in the land where they are held as prisoners. They turn away from their sins. They beg you to help them in the land where they are prisoners. They say, ‘We have sinned. We’ve done what is wrong. We’ve done what is evil.’"
2 Chronicles,6,38,And they turn back to you with all their heart and soul. Suppose it happens in the land where they were taken as prisoners. There they pray toward the land you gave their people long ago. They pray toward the city you have chosen. And they pray toward the temple I’ve built for your Name.
2 Chronicles,6,39,Then listen to them from heaven. It’s the place where you live. Listen to their prayer. Listen to them when they ask you to help them. Stand up for them. Your people have sinned against you. Please forgive them.
2 Chronicles,6,40,"“My God, let your eyes see us. Let your ears pay attention to the prayers offered in this place."
2 Chronicles,6,41,"“ Lord God, rise up and come to your resting place. Come in together with the ark. It’s the sign of your power. Lord God, may your priests put on salvation as if it were their clothes. May your faithful people be glad because you are so good."
2 Chronicles,6,42," Lord God, don’t turn your back on your anointed king. Remember the great love you promised to your servant David.”"
2 Chronicles,7,1,Solomon finished praying. Then fire came down from heaven. It burned up the burnt offering and the sacrifices. The glory of the Lord filled the temple.
2 Chronicles,7,2,The priests couldn’t enter the temple of the Lord because his glory filled it.
2 Chronicles,7,3,"All the Israelites saw the fire coming down. They saw the glory of the Lord above the temple. So they got down on their knees in the courtyard with their faces toward the ground. They worshiped the Lord . They gave thanks to him and said, “The Lord is good. His faithful love continues forever.”"
2 Chronicles,7,4,Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices to the Lord.
2 Chronicles,7,5,"King Solomon sacrificed 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep and goats. So the king and all the people set the temple of God apart."
2 Chronicles,7,6,"The priests and Levites took their positions. The Levites played the Lord ’s musical instruments. King David had made them for praising the Lord . They were used when he gave thanks to the Lord . He said, “His faithful love continues forever.” Across from where the Levites were, the priests blew their trumpets. All the people of Israel were standing."
2 Chronicles,7,7,"Solomon set the middle area of the courtyard apart to the Lord . It was in front of the Lord ’s temple. There Solomon sacrificed burnt offerings. He also sacrificed the fat of the friendship offerings there. He did it there because the bronze altar he had made couldn’t hold it all. It couldn’t hold the burnt offerings, the grain offerings and the fat parts."
2 Chronicles,7,8,At that time Solomon celebrated the Feast of Booths for seven days. The whole community of Israel was with him. It was a huge crowd. People came from as far away as Lebo Hamath and the Wadi of Egypt.
2 Chronicles,7,9,On the eighth day they held a special service. For seven days they had celebrated by setting the altar apart to honor God. The feast continued for seven more days.
2 Chronicles,7,10,Then Solomon sent the people home. It was the 23rd day of the seventh month. The people were glad. Their hearts were full of joy. That’s because the Lord had done good things for David and Solomon and his people Israel.
2 Chronicles,7,11,Solomon finished the Lord ’s temple and the royal palace. He had done everything he had planned to do in the Lord ’s temple and his own palace.
2 Chronicles,7,12,"The Lord appeared to him at night. The Lord said, “I have heard your prayer. I have chosen this place for myself. It is a temple where sacrifices will be offered."
2 Chronicles,7,13,“Suppose I close up the sky and there isn’t any rain. Suppose I command locusts to eat up the crops. And I send a plague among my people.
2 Chronicles,7,14,"But they make themselves humble in my sight. They pray and look to me. And they turn from their evil ways. Then I will listen to them from heaven. I will forgive their sin. And I will heal their land. After all, they are my people."
2 Chronicles,7,15,Now my eyes will see them. My ears will pay attention to the prayers they offer in this place.
2 Chronicles,7,16,I have chosen this temple. I have set it apart for myself. My Name will be there forever. My eyes and my heart will always be there.
2 Chronicles,7,17,"“But you must walk faithfully with me, just as your father David did. Do everything I command you to do. Obey my rules and laws."
2 Chronicles,7,18,"Then I will set up your royal throne. I made a covenant with your father David to do that. I said to him, ‘You will always have a son from your family line to rule over Israel.’"
2 Chronicles,7,19,“But suppose all of you turn away from me. You refuse to obey the rules and commands I have given you. And you go off to serve other gods and worship them.
2 Chronicles,7,20,Then I will remove Israel from my land. It is the land I gave them. I will turn my back on this temple. I will do it even though I have set it apart for my Name to be there. I will make all the nations hate it. They will laugh and joke about it.
2 Chronicles,7,21,"This temple will become a pile of stones. All those who pass by it will be shocked. They will say, ‘Why has the Lord done a thing like this to this land and temple?’"
2 Chronicles,7,22,"People will answer, ‘Because they have deserted the Lord . He is the God of their people who lived long ago. He brought them out of Egypt. But they have been holding on to other gods. They’ve been worshiping them. They’ve been serving them. That’s why the Lord has brought all this horrible trouble on them.’ ”"
2 Chronicles,8,1,"Solomon built the Lord ’s temple and his own palace. It took him 20 years to build them. After that,"
2 Chronicles,8,2,Solomon rebuilt the villages Hiram had given him. Solomon had Israelites make their homes in them.
2 Chronicles,8,3,Then Solomon went to Hamath Zobah. He captured it.
2 Chronicles,8,4,He also built up Tadmor in the desert. He built up all the cities in Hamath where he could store things.
2 Chronicles,8,5,He rebuilt Upper Beth Horon and Lower Beth Horon. He put up high walls around them. He made their city gates secure with heavy metal bars.
2 Chronicles,8,6,"He rebuilt Baalath and all the cities where he could store things. He also rebuilt all the cities for his chariots and horses. Solomon built anything he wanted in Jerusalem, Lebanon and all the territory he ruled."
2 Chronicles,8,7,"There were still many people left in the land who weren’t Israelites. They included Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites."
2 Chronicles,8,8,They were children of the people who had lived in the land before the Israelites came. The people of Israel hadn’t destroyed them. Solomon forced them to work very hard as his slaves. And they still work for Israel to this day.
2 Chronicles,8,9,"But Solomon didn’t force the Israelites to work as his slaves. Instead, some were his fighting men. Others were commanders of his captains, chariots and chariot drivers."
2 Chronicles,8,10,Still others were King Solomon’s chief officials. There were 250 officials in charge of the other men.
2 Chronicles,8,11,"Solomon brought Pharaoh’s daughter up from the City of David to the palace he had built for her. Solomon said, “My wife must not live in the palace of David, who was the king of Israel. It’s one of the places the ark of the Lord has entered. That makes it holy.”"
2 Chronicles,8,12,Solomon had built the Lord ’s altar. It stood in front of the temple porch. On that altar Solomon sacrificed burnt offerings to the Lord.
2 Chronicles,8,13,"Each day he sacrificed what the Law of Moses required. He sacrificed the required offerings every Sabbath day. He also sacrificed them at each New Moon feast and during the three yearly feasts. Those three were the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks and the Feast of Booths."
2 Chronicles,8,14,"Solomon followed the orders his father David had given him. He appointed the groups of priests for their duties. He appointed the Levites to lead the people in praising the Lord . They also helped the priests do their required tasks each day. Solomon appointed the groups of men who guarded all the gates. That’s what David, the man of God, had ordered."
2 Chronicles,8,15,The king’s commands were followed completely. They applied to the priests and Levites. They also applied to the temple treasure.
2 Chronicles,8,16,All of Solomon’s work was carried out. It started the day the foundation of the Lord ’s temple was laid. It ended when the Lord ’s temple was finished.
2 Chronicles,8,17,Solomon went to Ezion Geber and Elath on the coast of Edom.
2 Chronicles,8,18,Hiram sent him ships that his own officers commanded. They were sailors who knew the sea. Together with Solomon’s men they sailed to Ophir. They brought back 17 tons of gold. They gave it to King Solomon.
2 Chronicles,9,1,"The queen of Sheba heard about how famous Solomon was. So she came to Jerusalem to test him with hard questions. She arrived with a very large group of attendants. Her camels were carrying spices, huge amounts of gold, and valuable jewels. She came to Solomon and asked him about everything she wanted to know."
2 Chronicles,9,2,He answered all her questions. There wasn’t anything too hard for him to explain to her.
2 Chronicles,9,3,So the queen of Sheba saw how wise Solomon was. She saw the palace he had built.
2 Chronicles,9,4,She saw the food on his table. She saw his officials sitting there. She saw the robes of the servants who waited on everyone. She saw the robes the wine tasters were wearing. And she saw the burnt offerings Solomon sacrificed at the Lord ’s temple. She could hardly believe everything she had seen.
2 Chronicles,9,5,"She said to the king, “Back in my own country I heard a report about you. I heard about how much you had accomplished. I also heard about how wise you are. Everything I heard is true."
2 Chronicles,9,6,But I didn’t believe what people were saying. So I came to see for myself. And now I believe it! You are twice as wise as people say you are. The report I heard doesn’t even begin to tell the whole story about you.
2 Chronicles,9,7,How happy your people must be! How happy your officials must be! They always get to serve you and hear the wise things you say.
2 Chronicles,9,8,May the Lord your God be praised. He takes great delight in you. He placed you on his throne as king. He put you there to rule for him. Your God loves Israel very much. He longs to take good care of them forever. That’s why he has made you king over them. He knows that you will do what is fair and right.”
2 Chronicles,9,9,She gave the king four and a half tons of gold. She also gave him huge amounts of spices and valuable jewels. There had never been as many spices as the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
2 Chronicles,9,10,The servants of Hiram and the servants of Solomon brought gold from Ophir. They also brought algumwood and valuable jewels.
2 Chronicles,9,11,The king used the algumwood to make steps for the Lord ’s temple and the royal palace. He also used it to make harps and lyres for those who played the music. No one had ever seen anything like those instruments in Judah before.
2 Chronicles,9,12,"King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba everything she wanted and asked for. In fact, he gave her more than she had brought to him. Then she left. She returned to her own country with her attendants."
2 Chronicles,9,13,Each year Solomon received 25 tons of gold.
2 Chronicles,9,14,That didn’t include the money brought in by business and trade. All the kings of Arabia also brought gold and silver to Solomon. So did the governors of the territories.
2 Chronicles,9,15,King Solomon made 200 large shields out of hammered gold. Each one weighed 15 pounds.
2 Chronicles,9,16,He also made 300 small shields out of hammered gold. Each one weighed almost eight pounds. The king put all the shields in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon.
2 Chronicles,9,17,Then he made a large throne. It was covered with ivory. And that was covered with pure gold.
2 Chronicles,9,18,The throne had six steps. A gold stool for the king’s feet was connected to it. The throne had armrests on both sides of the seat. A statue of a lion stood on each side of the throne.
2 Chronicles,9,19,Twelve lions stood on the six steps. There was one at each end of each step. Nothing like that throne had ever been made for any other kingdom.
2 Chronicles,9,20,"All of King Solomon’s cups were made out of gold. All the things used in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon were made out of pure gold. Nothing was made out of silver. When Solomon was king, silver wasn’t considered to be worth very much."
2 Chronicles,9,21,"He had many ships that carried goods to be traded. The crews of those ships were made up of Hiram’s servants. Once every three years the ships returned. They brought gold, silver, ivory, apes and peacocks."
2 Chronicles,9,22,King Solomon was richer than all the other kings on earth. He was also wiser than they were.
2 Chronicles,9,23,All these kings wanted to meet Solomon in person. They wanted to see for themselves how wise God had made him.
2 Chronicles,9,24,"Year after year, everyone who came to him brought a gift. They brought gifts made out of silver and gold. They brought robes, weapons and spices. They also brought horses and mules."
2 Chronicles,9,25,"Solomon had 4,000 spaces where he kept his horses and chariots. He had 12,000 horses. He kept some of his horses and chariots in the chariot cities. He kept the others with him in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,9,26,Solomon ruled over all the kings from the Euphrates River to the land of the Philistines. He ruled all the way to the border of Egypt.
2 Chronicles,9,27,The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones. He made cedar wood as common there as sycamore-fig trees in the western hills.
2 Chronicles,9,28,Solomon got horses from Egypt. He also got them from many other countries.
2 Chronicles,9,29,The other events of Solomon’s rule from beginning to end are written down. They are written in the records of Nathan the prophet. They are written in the prophecy of Ahijah. He was from Shiloh. They are also written in the records of the visions of Iddo the prophet about Jeroboam. Jeroboam was the son of Nebat.
2 Chronicles,9,30,Solomon ruled in Jerusalem over the whole nation of Israel for 40 years.
2 Chronicles,9,31,Then he joined the members of his family who had already died. He was buried in the city of his father David. Solomon’s son Rehoboam became the next king after him.
2 Chronicles,10,1,Rehoboam went to the city of Shechem. All the Israelites had gone there to make him king.
2 Chronicles,10,2,Jeroboam heard about it. He was the son of Nebat. Jeroboam was in Egypt at that time. He had gone there for safety. He wanted to get away from King Solomon. But now he returned from Egypt.
2 Chronicles,10,3,"So the people sent for Jeroboam. He and all the people went to Rehoboam. They said to him,"
2 Chronicles,10,4,“Your father put a heavy load on our shoulders. But now make our hard work easier. Make the heavy load on us lighter. Then we’ll serve you.”
2 Chronicles,10,5,"Rehoboam answered, “Come back to me in three days.” So the people went away."
2 Chronicles,10,6,"Then King Rehoboam asked the elders for advice. They had served his father Solomon while he was still living. Rehoboam asked them, “What advice can you give me? How should I answer these people?”"
2 Chronicles,10,7,"They replied, “Be kind to them. Please them. Give them what they are asking for. Then they’ll always serve you.”"
2 Chronicles,10,8,But Rehoboam didn’t accept the advice the elders gave him. He asked for advice from the young men who had grown up with him and were now serving him.
2 Chronicles,10,9,"He asked them, “What’s your advice? How should I answer these people? They said to me, ‘Make the load your father put on our shoulders lighter.’ ”"
2 Chronicles,10,10,"The young men who had grown up with him gave their answer. They replied, “The people have said to you, ‘Your father put a heavy load on our shoulders. Make it lighter.’ Now tell them, ‘My little finger is stronger than my father’s legs."
2 Chronicles,10,11,My father put a heavy load on your shoulders. But I’ll make it even heavier. My father beat you with whips. But I’ll beat you with bigger whips.’ ”
2 Chronicles,10,12,"Three days later Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam. That’s because the king had said, “Come back to me in three days.”"
2 Chronicles,10,13,The king answered them in a mean way. He didn’t accept the advice of the elders.
2 Chronicles,10,14,"Instead, he followed the advice of the young men. He said, “My father put a heavy load on your shoulders. But I’ll make it even heavier. My father beat you with whips. But I’ll beat you with bigger whips.”"
2 Chronicles,10,15,"So the king didn’t listen to the people. That’s because God had planned it that way. What the Lord had said through Ahijah came true. Ahijah had spoken the Lord ’s message to Jeroboam, the son of Nebat. Ahijah was from Shiloh."
2 Chronicles,10,16,"All the Israelites saw that the king refused to listen to them. So they answered the king. They said, “We don’t have any share in David’s royal family. We don’t have any share in Jesse’s son. People of Israel, let’s go back to our homes. David’s royal family, take care of your own kingdom!” So all the Israelites went home."
2 Chronicles,10,17,But Rehoboam still ruled over the Israelites who were living in the towns of Judah.
2 Chronicles,10,18,Adoniram was in charge of those who were forced to work hard for King Rehoboam. The king sent him out among the Israelites. But they killed Adoniram by throwing stones at him. Rehoboam was able to get away in his chariot. He escaped to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,10,19,Israel has refused to follow the royal family of David to this day.
2 Chronicles,11,1,"Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem. He brought together 180,000 capable young men from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. He had decided to go to war against Israel. He wanted his fighting men to get the kingdom of Israel back for him."
2 Chronicles,11,2,"But a message came to Shemaiah from the Lord . Shemaiah was a man of God. The Lord said to him,"
2 Chronicles,11,3,"“Speak to Solomon’s son Rehoboam, the king of Judah. Speak to all the people of Israel in Judah and Benjamin. Tell them,"
2 Chronicles,11,4,"‘The Lord says, “Do not go up to fight against your relatives. I want every one of you to go back home. Things have happened exactly the way I planned them.” ’ ” So the young men obeyed the Lord ’s message. They turned back. They didn’t march out against Jeroboam."
2 Chronicles,11,5,Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem. He made Judah more secure by building up its towns.
2 Chronicles,11,6,"He built up Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa,"
2 Chronicles,11,7,"Beth Zur, Soko and Adullam."
2 Chronicles,11,8,"He also built up Gath, Mareshah, Ziph,"
2 Chronicles,11,9,"Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah,"
2 Chronicles,11,10,"Zorah, Aijalon and Hebron. All of them were cities in Judah and Benjamin that had high walls around them."
2 Chronicles,11,11,"Rehoboam made those cities even more secure. He put commanders in them. He gave the cities plenty of food, olive oil and wine."
2 Chronicles,11,12,He put shields and spears in all those cities. He made them very strong. So he ruled over Judah and Benjamin.
2 Chronicles,11,13,The priests and Levites were on Rehoboam’s side. They came from their territories all over Israel.
2 Chronicles,11,14,The Levites even left their grasslands and other property behind. They came to Judah and Jerusalem. That’s because Jeroboam and his sons had refused to accept them as priests of the Lord.
2 Chronicles,11,15,Jeroboam had appointed his own priests to serve at the high places. He had made statues of gods that looked like goats and calves. His priests served those gods.
2 Chronicles,11,16,Some people from every tribe in Israel followed the Levites to Jerusalem. With all their hearts they wanted to worship the Lord . He is the God of Israel. They came to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices to him. He was the God of their people of long ago.
2 Chronicles,11,17,All those who came to Jerusalem made the kingdom of Judah strong. They helped Solomon’s son Rehoboam for three years. During that time they lived the way David and Solomon had lived.
2 Chronicles,11,18,Rehoboam married Mahalath. She was the daughter of David’s son Jerimoth. Her mother was Abihail. Abihail was the daughter of Jesse’s son Eliab.
2 Chronicles,11,19,"Mahalath had sons by Rehoboam. Their names were Jeush, Shemariah and Zaham."
2 Chronicles,11,20,"Then Rehoboam married Maakah. She was the daughter of Absalom. She had sons by Rehoboam. Their names were Abijah, Attai, Ziza and Shelomith."
2 Chronicles,11,21,"Rehoboam loved Absalom’s daughter Maakah. In fact, he loved her more than any of his other wives and concubines. He had a total of 18 wives and 60 concubines. And he had a total of 28 sons and 60 daughters."
2 Chronicles,11,22,Rehoboam appointed Maakah’s son Abijah to be the chief prince among his brothers. He did it because he wanted to make him king.
2 Chronicles,11,23,Rehoboam acted wisely. He scattered some of his sons through all the territories of Judah and Benjamin. He put them in all the cities that had high walls around them. He gave them plenty of food and everything else they needed. He also gave them many wives.
2 Chronicles,12,1,Rehoboam had made his position as king secure. He had become very strong. Then he turned away from the law of the Lord . So did all the people of Judah.
2 Chronicles,12,2,They hadn’t been faithful to the Lord . So Shishak attacked Jerusalem. It was in the fifth year that Rehoboam was king. Shishak was king of Egypt.
2 Chronicles,12,3,"He came with 1,200 chariots and 60,000 horsemen. Troops of Libyans, Sukkites and Cushites came with him from Egypt. There were so many of them they couldn’t be counted."
2 Chronicles,12,4,Shishak captured the cities of Judah that had high walls around them. He came all the way to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,12,5,"Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the leaders of Judah. They had gathered together in Jerusalem. They were afraid of Shishak. Shemaiah said to them, “The Lord says, ‘You have left me. So now I am leaving you to Shishak.’ ”"
2 Chronicles,12,6,"The king and the leaders of Israel made themselves humble in the Lord ’s sight. They said, “The Lord does what is right and fair.”"
2 Chronicles,12,7,"The Lord saw they had made themselves humble. So he gave a message to Shemaiah. The Lord said, “They have made themselves humble in my sight. So I will not destroy them. Instead, I will soon save them. Even though I am very angry with Jerusalem, I will not use Shishak to destroy them."
2 Chronicles,12,8,But the people of Jerusalem will be brought under his control. Then they will learn the difference between serving me and serving the kings of other lands.”
2 Chronicles,12,9,"Shishak, the king of Egypt, attacked Jerusalem. He carried away the treasures of the Lord ’s temple. He also carried the treasures of the royal palace away. He took everything. That included the gold shields Solomon had made."
2 Chronicles,12,10,So King Rehoboam made bronze shields to take their place. He gave them to the commanders of the guards who were on duty at the entrance to the royal palace.
2 Chronicles,12,11,"Every time the king went to the Lord ’s temple, the guards went with him. They carried the shields. Later, they took them back to the room where they were kept."
2 Chronicles,12,12,"Rehoboam had made himself humble in the Lord ’s sight. So the Lord turned his anger away from him. Rehoboam wasn’t totally destroyed. In fact, some good things happened in Judah."
2 Chronicles,12,13,King Rehoboam had made his position secure in Jerusalem. He continued as king. He was 41 years old when he became king. He ruled for 17 years in Jerusalem. It was the city the Lord had chosen out of all the cities in the tribes of Israel. He wanted to put his Name there. The name of Rehoboam’s mother was Naamah from Ammon.
2 Chronicles,12,14,Rehoboam did what was evil. That’s because he hadn’t worshiped the Lord with all his heart.
2 Chronicles,12,15,"The events of Rehoboam’s rule from beginning to end are written down. They are written in the records of Shemaiah and Iddo, the prophets. The records deal with family histories. Rehoboam and Jeroboam were always at war with each other."
2 Chronicles,12,16,Rehoboam joined the members of his family who had already died. He was buried in the City of David. Rehoboam’s son Abijah became the next king after him.
2 Chronicles,13,1,Abijah became king of Judah. It was in the 18th year of Jeroboam’s rule over Israel.
2 Chronicles,13,2,Abijah ruled in Jerusalem for three years. His mother’s name was Maakah. She was a daughter of Uriel. Uriel was from Gibeah. There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
2 Chronicles,13,3,"Abijah went into battle with an army of 400,000 capable fighting men. Jeroboam lined up his soldiers against them. He had 800,000 able troops."
2 Chronicles,13,4,"Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim. It’s in the hill country of Ephraim. Abijah said, “Jeroboam and all you Israelites, listen to me!"
2 Chronicles,13,5,The Lord is the God of Israel. Don’t you know that he has placed David and his sons after him on Israel’s throne forever? The Lord made a covenant of salt with David. The salt means the covenant will last for all time to come.
2 Chronicles,13,6,"Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, was an official of David’s son Solomon. But he refused to obey his master."
2 Chronicles,13,7,Some worthless and evil men gathered around him. They opposed Solomon’s son Rehoboam. At that time Rehoboam was young. He couldn’t make up his mind. He wasn’t strong enough to stand up against those men.
2 Chronicles,13,8,“Now you plan to stand up against the kingdom of the Lord . His kingdom is in the hands of men in David’s family line. It’s true that you have a huge army. You have the statues of the golden calves that Jeroboam made to be your gods.
2 Chronicles,13,9,"But you drove out the priests of the Lord , the sons of Aaron. You also drove out the Levites. You appointed your own priests. That’s what the people of other nations do. Anyone can come and set himself apart. All he has to do is sacrifice a young bull and seven rams. Then he becomes a priest of gods that aren’t really gods at all!"
2 Chronicles,13,10,“But the Lord is our God. We haven’t deserted him. The priests who serve the Lord belong to the family line of Aaron. The Levites help them.
2 Chronicles,13,11,Every morning and evening the priests bring burnt offerings and sweet-smelling incense to the Lord . They set out the holy bread on the table. That table is ‘clean.’ They light the lamps on the gold lampstand every evening. We always do what the Lord our God requires in his law. But you have deserted him.
2 Chronicles,13,12,"God is with us. He’s our leader. His priests will blow their trumpets. They will sound the battle cry against you. People of Israel, don’t fight against the Lord . He’s the God of your people who lived long ago. You can’t possibly succeed.”"
2 Chronicles,13,13,Jeroboam had sent some troops behind Judah’s battle lines. He told them to hide and wait there. He and his men stayed in front of Judah’s lines.
2 Chronicles,13,14,Judah turned and saw that they were being attacked from the front and from the back. Then they cried out to the Lord . The priests blew their trumpets.
2 Chronicles,13,15,"The men of Judah shouted the battle cry. When they did, God drove Jeroboam and all the Israelites away from Abijah and Judah."
2 Chronicles,13,16,The Israelites ran away from them. God handed Israel over to Judah.
2 Chronicles,13,17,"Abijah and his troops wounded and killed large numbers of them. In fact, 500,000 of Israel’s capable men lay dead or wounded."
2 Chronicles,13,18,"So at that time the Israelites were brought under Judah’s control. The people of Judah won the battle over them. That’s because they trusted in the Lord , the God of their people."
2 Chronicles,13,19,"Abijah chased Jeroboam. He captured from him the towns of Bethel, Jeshanah and Ephron. He also captured the villages around them."
2 Chronicles,13,20,"Jeroboam didn’t get his power back during the time of Abijah. In fact, the Lord struck Jeroboam down, and he died."
2 Chronicles,13,21,But Abijah grew stronger. He married 14 wives. He had 22 sons and 16 daughters.
2 Chronicles,13,22,The other events of Abijah’s rule are written down. The things he did and said are written in the notes of Iddo the prophet.
2 Chronicles,14,1,"Abijah joined the members of his family who had already died. He was buried in the City of David. Abijah’s son Asa became the next king after him. While Asa was king, the country had peace and rest for ten years."
2 Chronicles,14,2,Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of the Lord his God.
2 Chronicles,14,3,Asa removed the altars where false gods were worshiped. He took away the high places. He smashed the sacred stones. He cut down the poles used to worship the female god named Asherah.
2 Chronicles,14,4,"He commanded Judah to worship the Lord , the God of their people. He commanded them to obey the Lord ’s laws and commands."
2 Chronicles,14,5,Asa removed the high places and incense altars from every town in Judah. The kingdom had peace and rest under his rule.
2 Chronicles,14,6,He built up the cities of Judah that had high walls around them. The land was at peace. No one was at war with Asa during those years. That’s because the Lord gave him peace and rest.
2 Chronicles,14,7,"“Let’s build up our towns,” Asa said to the people of Judah. “Let’s put walls around them. Let’s provide them with towers. Let’s make them secure with gates that have heavy metal bars. The land still belongs to us. That’s because we’ve trusted in the Lord our God. We trusted in him, and he has given us peace and rest on every side.” So they built. And things went well for them."
2 Chronicles,14,8,"Asa had an army of 300,000 men from Judah. They carried spears and large shields. There were 280,000 men from Benjamin. They were armed with bows and small shields. All these men were brave soldiers."
2 Chronicles,14,9,Zerah marched out against them. He was from Cush. He had a huge army of thousands. He also had 300 chariots. They came all the way to Mareshah.
2 Chronicles,14,10,Asa went out to meet Zerah in battle. They took up their positions in the Valley of Zephathah. It’s near Mareshah.
2 Chronicles,14,11,"Then Asa called out to the Lord his God. He said, “ Lord , there isn’t anyone like you. You help the weak against the strong. Lord our God, help us. We trust in you. In your name we have come out to fight against this huge army. Lord , you are our God. Don’t let mere human beings win the battle over you.”"
2 Chronicles,14,12,The Lord struck down the men of Cush for Asa and Judah. The Cushites ran away.
2 Chronicles,14,13,Asa and his army chased them all the way to Gerar. A large number of Cushites fell down wounded or dead. So they couldn’t fight back. The Lord and his army crushed them. The men of Judah carried off a large amount of goods.
2 Chronicles,14,14,They destroyed all the villages around Gerar. The Lord had made the people in those villages afraid of him. The men of Judah took everything from all the villages.
2 Chronicles,14,15,"They also attacked the camps of those who took care of the herds. They carried off large numbers of sheep, goats and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,15,1,The Spirit of God came on Azariah. He was the son of Oded.
2 Chronicles,15,2,"Azariah went out to meet Asa. He said to him, “Asa and all you people of Judah and Benjamin, listen to me. The Lord is with you when you are with him. If you really look for him, you will find him. But if you desert him, he will desert you."
2 Chronicles,15,3,For a long time Israel didn’t worship the true God. They didn’t have a priest who taught them. So they didn’t know God’s law.
2 Chronicles,15,4,"But when they were in trouble, they turned to the Lord , the God of Israel. When they did, they found him."
2 Chronicles,15,5,In those days it wasn’t safe to travel around. The people who lived in all the areas of the land were having a lot of trouble.
2 Chronicles,15,6,One nation was crushing another. One city was crushing another. That’s because God was causing them to suffer terribly.
2 Chronicles,15,7,But be strong. Don’t give up. God will reward you for your work.”
2 Chronicles,15,8,"Asa heard that prophecy. He paid attention to the words of Azariah the prophet, the son of Oded. So Asa became bolder than ever. He removed the statues of gods from the whole land of Judah and Benjamin. He also removed them from the towns he had captured in the hills of Ephraim. He did it because the Lord hated those gods. Asa repaired the altar of the Lord . It was in front of the porch of the Lord ’s temple."
2 Chronicles,15,9,"Then Asa gathered together all the people of Judah and Benjamin. He also gathered together the people from Ephraim, Manasseh and Simeon who were living among them. Large numbers of people had come over to him from Israel. They came because they saw that the Lord his God was with him."
2 Chronicles,15,10,They gathered in Jerusalem. It was the third month of the 15th year of Asa’s rule.
2 Chronicles,15,11,"At that time they sacrificed to the Lord 700 oxen and 7,000 sheep and goats. The animals were among the things they had taken after the battle."
2 Chronicles,15,12,"They made a covenant to obey the Lord , the God of their people. They would obey him with all their heart and soul."
2 Chronicles,15,13,"All those who wouldn’t obey the Lord , the God of Israel, would be killed. It wouldn’t matter how important they were. It wouldn’t matter whether they were men or women."
2 Chronicles,15,14,They made a promise to the Lord . They praised him out loud. They shouted. They blew trumpets and horns.
2 Chronicles,15,15,"All the people of Judah were happy about the promise they had made. They turned to God with all their heart. When they did, they found him. So the Lord gave them peace and rest on every side."
2 Chronicles,15,16,King Asa also removed his grandmother Maakah from her position as queen mother. That’s because she had made a pole used to worship the female god named Asherah. The Lord hated it. So Asa cut it down. He broke it up. He burned it in the Kidron Valley.
2 Chronicles,15,17,Asa didn’t remove the high places from Israel. But he committed his whole life completely to the Lord.
2 Chronicles,15,18,"He and his father had set apart silver, gold and other things to the Lord . Asa brought them into God’s temple."
2 Chronicles,15,19,There weren’t any more wars until the 35th year of Asa’s rule.
2 Chronicles,16,1,"Baasha was king of Israel. He marched out against Judah. It was in the 36th year of Asa’s rule over Judah. Baasha built up the walls of Ramah. He did it to keep people from leaving or entering the territory of Asa, the king of Judah."
2 Chronicles,16,2,Asa took the silver and gold from among the treasures of the Lord ’s temple and his own palace. He sent it to Ben-Hadad. Ben-Hadad was king of Aram. He was ruling in Damascus.
2 Chronicles,16,3,"“Let’s make a peace treaty between us,” Asa said. “My father and your father had made a peace treaty between them. Now I’m sending you silver and gold. So break your treaty with Baasha, the king of Israel. Then he’ll go back home.”"
2 Chronicles,16,4,"Ben-Hadad agreed with King Asa. He sent his army commanders against the towns of Israel. His army captured Ijon, Dan, Abel Maim and all the cities in Naphtali where Baasha stored things."
2 Chronicles,16,5,Baasha heard about it. So he stopped building up Ramah and left that place.
2 Chronicles,16,6,Then King Asa brought all the men of Judah to Ramah. They carried away the stones and wood Baasha had been using. Asa used them to build up Geba and Mizpah.
2 Chronicles,16,7,"At that time Hanani the prophet came to Asa, the king of Judah. He said to him, “You trusted the king of Aram. You didn’t trust in the Lord your God. So the army of the king of Aram has escaped from you."
2 Chronicles,16,8,The people of Cush and Libya had a strong army. They had large numbers of chariots and horsemen. But you trusted in the Lord . So he handed them over to you.
2 Chronicles,16,9,The Lord looks out over the whole earth. He gives strength to those who commit their lives completely to him. You have done a foolish thing. From now on you will be at war.”
2 Chronicles,16,10,"Asa was angry with the prophet because of what he had said. In fact, he was so angry he put him in prison. At the same time, Asa treated some of his own people very badly."

2 Chronicles,16,14,He was buried in a tomb. He had cut it out for himself in the City of David. His body was laid on a wooden frame. It was covered with spices and different mixes of perfume. A huge fire was made to honor him.

2 Chronicles,17,3,The Lord was with Jehoshaphat. That’s because he lived the way King David had lived. He didn’t ask for advice from the gods that were named Baal.
2 Chronicles,17,4,"Instead, Jehoshaphat obeyed the God of his father. He obeyed the Lord ’s commands instead of the practices of Israel."
2 Chronicles,17,5,The Lord made the kingdom secure under Jehoshaphat’s control. All the people of Judah brought gifts to Jehoshaphat. So he had great wealth and honor.

2 Chronicles,18,2,Some years later he went down to see Ahab in Samaria. Ahab killed a lot of sheep and cattle for Jehoshaphat and the people with him. Ahab tried to get Jehoshaphat to attack Ramoth Gilead.
2 Chronicles,18,3,"Ahab was the king of Israel. He spoke to Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah. He asked, “Will you go with me to fight against Ramoth Gilead?” Jehoshaphat replied, “Yes. I’ll go with you. My men will also go with your men. We’ll join you in the war.”"
2 Chronicles,18,4,"He continued, “First ask the Lord for advice.”"
2 Chronicles,18,5,"So the king of Israel brought 400 prophets together. He asked them, “Should we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or not?” “Go,” they answered. “God will hand it over to you.”"
2 Chronicles,18,6,"But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there no longer a prophet of the Lord here? If there is, ask him what we should do.”"
2 Chronicles,18,7,"The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat. He said, “There is still one prophet we can go to. We can ask the Lord for advice through him. But I hate him. He never prophesies anything good about me. He only prophesies bad things. His name is Micaiah. He’s the son of Imlah.” “You shouldn’t say bad things about him,” Jehoshaphat replied."
2 Chronicles,18,8,"So the king of Israel called for one of his officials. He told him, “Bring Micaiah, the son of Imlah, right away.”"
2 Chronicles,18,9,"The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, were wearing their royal robes. They were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor. It was near the entrance of the gate of Samaria. All the prophets were prophesying in front of them."
2 Chronicles,18,10,"Zedekiah was the son of Kenaanah. Zedekiah had made horns out of iron. They looked like animal horns. He announced, “The Lord says, ‘With these horns you will drive back the men of Aram until they are destroyed.’ ”"
2 Chronicles,18,11,"All the other prophets were prophesying the same thing. “Attack Ramoth Gilead,” they said. “Win the battle over it. The Lord will hand it over to you.”"
2 Chronicles,18,12,"A messenger went to get Micaiah. He said to him, “Look. The other prophets agree. All of them are saying the king will have success. So agree with them. Say the same thing they do.”"
2 Chronicles,18,13,"But Micaiah said, “You can be sure that the Lord lives. And you can be just as sure that I can only tell the king what my God says.”"
2 Chronicles,18,14,"When Micaiah arrived, the king spoke to him. He asked, “Should we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or not?” “Attack,” he answered. “You will win. The people of Ramoth Gilead will be handed over to you.”"
2 Chronicles,18,15,"The king said to him, “I’ve made you promise to tell the truth many times before. So don’t tell me anything but the truth in the name of the Lord .”"
2 Chronicles,18,16,"Then Micaiah answered, “I saw all the Israelites scattered on the hills. They were like sheep that didn’t have a shepherd. The Lord said, ‘These people do not have a master. Let each of them go home in peace.’ ”"
2 Chronicles,18,17,"The king of Israel spoke to Jehoshaphat. He said, “Didn’t I tell you he never prophesies anything good about me? He only prophesies bad things.”"
2 Chronicles,18,18,"Micaiah continued, “Listen to the Lord ’s message. I saw the Lord sitting on his throne. Some of the angels of heaven were standing at his right side. The others were standing at his left side."
2 Chronicles,18,19,"The Lord said, ‘Who will get Ahab, the king of Israel, to attack Ramoth Gilead? I want him to die there.’ “One angel suggested one thing. Another suggested something else."
2 Chronicles,18,20,"Finally, a spirit came forward and stood in front of the Lord . The spirit said, ‘I’ll get Ahab to do it.’ “ ‘How?’ the Lord asked."
2 Chronicles,18,21,"“The spirit said, ‘I’ll go and put lies in the mouths of all his prophets.’ “ ‘You will have success in getting Ahab to attack Ramoth Gilead,’ said the Lord . ‘Go and do it.’"
2 Chronicles,18,22,“So the Lord has put lies in the mouths of your prophets. He has said that great harm will come to you.”
2 Chronicles,18,23,"Then Zedekiah, the son of Kenaanah, went up and slapped Micaiah in the face. Zedekiah asked Micaiah, “Do you think the spirit sent by the Lord left me? Do you think that spirit went to speak to you?”"
2 Chronicles,18,24,"Micaiah replied, “You will find out on the day you go to hide in an inside room to save your life.”"
2 Chronicles,18,25,"Then the king of Israel gave an order. He said, “Take Micaiah away. Send him back to Amon. Amon is the ruler of the city of Samaria. And send Micaiah back to Joash. Joash is a member of the royal court."
2 Chronicles,18,26,"Tell them, ‘The king says, “Put this fellow in prison. Don’t give him anything but bread and water until I return safely.” ’ ”"
2 Chronicles,18,27,"Micaiah announced, “Do you really think you will return safely? If you do, the Lord hasn’t spoken through me.” He continued, “All you people, remember what I’ve said!”"
2 Chronicles,18,28,"So the king of Israel went up to Ramoth Gilead. Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, went there too."
2 Chronicles,18,29,"The king of Israel spoke to Jehoshaphat. He said, “I’ll go into battle wearing different clothes. Then people won’t recognize me. But you wear your royal robes.” So the king of Israel put on different clothes. Then he went into battle."
2 Chronicles,18,30,"The king of Aram had given an order to his chariot commanders. He had said, “Fight only against the king of Israel. Don’t fight against anyone else.”"
2 Chronicles,18,31,"The chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat. They thought, “That’s the king of Israel.” So they turned to attack him. But Jehoshaphat cried out. And the Lord helped him. God drew the commanders away from him."
2 Chronicles,18,32,They saw he wasn’t the king of Israel after all. So they stopped chasing him.
2 Chronicles,18,33,"But someone shot an arrow without taking aim. The arrow hit the king of Israel between the parts of his armor. The king told the chariot driver, “Turn the chariot around. Get me out of this battle. I’ve been wounded.”"
2 Chronicles,18,34,All day long the battle continued. The king of Israel kept himself standing up by leaning against the inside of his chariot. He kept his face toward the men of Aram until evening. At sunset he died.
2 Chronicles,19,1,"Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, returned safely to his palace in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,19,2,"Jehu the prophet went out to meet him. He was the son of Hanani. Jehu said to the king, “You shouldn’t help evil people. You shouldn’t love those who hate the Lord . The Lord is angry with you."

2 Chronicles,19,4,"Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem. He went out again among the people. He went from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim. He turned the people back to the Lord , the God of Israel."
2 Chronicles,19,5,Jehoshaphat appointed judges in the land. He put them in all the cities of Judah that had high walls around them.
2 Chronicles,19,6,"He told the judges, “Think carefully about what you do. After all, you aren’t judging for human beings. You are judging for the Lord . He’s with you every time you make a decision."
2 Chronicles,19,7,Have respect for the Lord . Judge carefully. He is always right. He treats everyone the same. Our God doesn’t want his judges to take money from people who want special favors.”
2 Chronicles,19,8,"In Jerusalem, Jehoshaphat chose some Levites and priests. He also chose some leaders of Israelite families. He appointed all of them to apply the law of the Lord fairly. He wanted them to decide cases. He wanted them to settle matters between people. All those judges lived in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,19,9,"Here are the orders Jehoshaphat gave them. He said, “Have respect for the Lord . Serve him faithfully. Do it with all your heart."
2 Chronicles,19,10,"Cases will come to you from your people who live in the other cities. The cases might be about murder or other matters dealt with by the law, commands, directions and rules. Warn the people not to sin against the Lord . If you don’t warn them, he will be angry with you and your people. Do what I say. Then you won’t sin."
2 Chronicles,19,11,“Amariah the chief priest will be over you in any matter that concerns the Lord . Zebadiah is the leader of the tribe of Judah. He is the son of Ishmael.

2 Chronicles,20,2,"Some people came and told him, “A huge army is coming from Edom to fight against you. They have come across the Dead Sea. They are already in Hazezon Tamar.” Hazezon Tamar is also called En Gedi."
2 Chronicles,20,3,Jehoshaphat was alarmed. So he decided to ask the Lord for advice. He told all the people of Judah to go without eating.
2 Chronicles,20,4,"The people came together to ask the Lord for help. In fact, they came from every town in Judah to pray to him."
2 Chronicles,20,5,Then Jehoshaphat stood up among the people of Judah and Jerusalem. He was in front of the new courtyard at the Lord ’s temple.
2 Chronicles,20,6,"He said, “ Lord , you are the God of our people who lived long ago. You are the God who is in heaven. You rule over all the kingdoms of the nations. You are strong and powerful. No one can fight against you and win."

2 Chronicles,20,9,"‘Suppose trouble comes on us. It doesn’t matter whether it’s a punishing sword, or plague or hunger. We’ll serve you. We’ll stand in front of this temple where your Name is. We’ll cry out to you when we’re in trouble. Then you will hear us. You will save us.’"
2 Chronicles,20,10,"“But here are men from Ammon, Moab and Mount Seir. You wouldn’t allow Israel to march in and attack their territory when the Israelites came from Egypt. So Israel turned away from them. They didn’t destroy them."
2 Chronicles,20,11,See how they are paying us back. They are coming to drive us out. They want to take over the land you gave us as our share.
2 Chronicles,20,12,"Our God, won’t you please judge them? We don’t have the power to face this huge army that’s attacking us. We don’t know what to do. But we’re looking to you to help us.”"
2 Chronicles,20,13,"All the men of Judah stood there in front of the Lord . Their wives, children and little ones were with them."
2 Chronicles,20,14,Then the Spirit of the Lord came on Jahaziel. He was standing among the people of Israel. He was the son of Zechariah. Zechariah was the son of Benaiah. Benaiah was the son of Jeiel. Jeiel was the son of Mattaniah. Jahaziel was a Levite. He was from the family line of Asaph.
2 Chronicles,20,15,"Jahaziel said, “King Jehoshaphat, listen! All you who live in Judah and Jerusalem, listen! The Lord says to you, ‘Do not be afraid. Do not lose hope because of this huge army. The battle is not yours. It is God’s."
2 Chronicles,20,16,Tomorrow march down against them. They will be climbing up by the Pass of Ziz. You will find them at the end of the valley in the Desert of Jeruel.
2 Chronicles,20,17,"You will not have to fight this battle. Take your positions. Stand firm. You will see how the Lord will save you. Judah and Jerusalem, do not be afraid. Do not lose hope. Go out and face them tomorrow. The Lord will be with you.’ ”"
2 Chronicles,20,18,Jehoshaphat bowed down with his face toward the ground. All the people of Judah and Jerusalem also bowed down. They worshiped the Lord.

2 Chronicles,20,20,"Early in the morning all the people left for the Desert of Tekoa. As they started out, Jehoshaphat stood up. He said, “Judah, listen to me! People of Jerusalem, listen to me! Have faith in the Lord your God. He’ll take good care of you. Have faith in his prophets. Then you will have success.”"
2 Chronicles,20,21,"Jehoshaphat asked the people for advice. Then he appointed men to sing to the Lord . He wanted them to praise the Lord because of his glory and holiness. They marched out in front of the army. They said, “Give thanks to the Lord. His faithful love continues forever.”"
2 Chronicles,20,22,"They began to sing and praise him. Then the Lord hid some men and told them to wait. He wanted them to attack the people of Ammon, Moab and Mount Seir. They had gone into Judah and attacked it. But they lost the battle."
2 Chronicles,20,23,"The Ammonites and Moabites rose up against the men from Mount Seir. They destroyed them. They put an end to them. When they finished killing the men from Seir, they destroyed one another."
2 Chronicles,20,24,The men of Judah came to the place that looks out over the desert. They turned to look down at the huge army. But all they saw was dead bodies lying there on the ground. No one had escaped.
2 Chronicles,20,25,"So Jehoshaphat and his men went down there to carry off anything of value. Among the dead bodies they found a large amount of supplies, clothes and other things of value. There was more than they could take away. There was so much it took three days to collect all of it."
2 Chronicles,20,26,On the fourth day they gathered together in the Valley of Berakah. There they praised the Lord . That’s why it’s called the Valley of Berakah to this day.
2 Chronicles,20,27,Then all the men of Judah and Jerusalem returned to Jerusalem. They were filled with joy. Jehoshaphat led them. The Lord had made them happy because all their enemies were dead.
2 Chronicles,20,28,"They entered Jerusalem and went to the Lord ’s temple. They were playing harps, lyres and trumpets."
2 Chronicles,20,29,All the surrounding kingdoms began to have respect for God. They had heard how the Lord had fought against Israel’s enemies.
2 Chronicles,20,30,The kingdom of Jehoshaphat was at peace. His God had given him peace and rest on every side.
2 Chronicles,20,31,So Jehoshaphat ruled over Judah. He was 35 years old when he became Judah’s king. He ruled in Jerusalem for 25 years. His mother’s name was Azubah. She was the daughter of Shilhi.
2 Chronicles,20,32,Jehoshaphat followed the ways of his father Asa. He didn’t wander away from them. He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord.
2 Chronicles,20,33,But the high places weren’t removed. The people still hadn’t worshiped the God of Israel with all their hearts.
2 Chronicles,20,34,"The other events of Jehoshaphat’s rule from beginning to end are written down. They are written in the official records of Jehu, the son of Hanani. They are written in the records of the kings of Israel."
2 Chronicles,20,35,Jehoshaphat king of Judah and Ahaziah king of Israel agreed to be friends. Ahaziah did what was evil.
2 Chronicles,20,36,Jehoshaphat agreed with him to build a lot of ships. They were built at Ezion Geber. They carried goods that were traded for other goods.
2 Chronicles,20,37,"Eliezer was the son of Dodavahu from Mareshah. Eliezer prophesied against Jehoshaphat. He said, “You have joined forces with Ahaziah. So the Lord will destroy what you have made.” The ships were wrecked. They were never able to sail or trade goods."
2 Chronicles,21,1,Jehoshaphat joined the members of his family who had already died. He was buried in the family tomb in the City of David. Jehoshaphat’s son Jehoram became the next king after him.
2 Chronicles,21,2,"Jehoram’s brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat, were Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariahu, Michael and Shephatiah. All of them were sons of Jehoshaphat, the king of Israel."
2 Chronicles,21,3,"Their father had given them many gifts. He had given them silver, gold and other things of value. He had also given them cities in Judah that had high walls around them. But he had made Jehoram king. That’s because Jehoram was his oldest son."
2 Chronicles,21,4,Jehoram made his position secure over his father’s kingdom. Then he killed all his brothers with his sword. He also killed some of the officials of Israel.
2 Chronicles,21,5,Jehoram was 32 years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for eight years.
2 Chronicles,21,6,"He followed the ways of the kings of Israel, just as the royal family of Ahab had done. In fact, he married a daughter of Ahab. Jehoram did what was evil in the eyes of the Lord."
2 Chronicles,21,7,But the Lord didn’t want to destroy the royal family of David. That’s because the Lord had made a covenant with him. The Lord had promised to keep the lamp of David’s kingdom burning brightly. The Lord had promised that for David and his children after him forever.
2 Chronicles,21,8,"When Jehoram was king over Judah, Edom refused to remain under Judah’s control. They set up their own king."
2 Chronicles,21,9,So Jehoram went to Edom. He took his officers and all his chariots with him. The men of Edom surrounded him and his chariot commanders. But he got up at night and fought his way out.
2 Chronicles,21,10,"To this day Edom has refused to remain under Judah’s control. At that same time, Libnah also refused to remain under the control of Judah. That’s because Jehoram had deserted the Lord , the God of his people."
2 Chronicles,21,11,Jehoram had also built high places on the hills of Judah. He had caused the people of Jerusalem to worship other gods. They weren’t faithful to the Lord . Jehoram had led Judah down the wrong path.
2 Chronicles,21,12,"Jehoram received a letter from Elijah the prophet. In it, Elijah said, “The Lord is the God of your father David. The Lord says, ‘You have not followed the ways of your own father Jehoshaphat or of Asa, the king of Judah."
2 Chronicles,21,13,"Instead, you have followed the ways of the kings of Israel. You have led Judah and the people of Jerusalem to worship other gods, just as the royal family of Ahab did. Also, you have murdered your own brothers. They were members of your own family. They were better men than you are."
2 Chronicles,21,14,"So now the Lord is about to strike down your people with a heavy blow. He will strike down your sons, your wives and everything that belongs to you."
2 Chronicles,21,15,And you yourself will be very sick for a long time. The sickness will finally cause your insides to come out.’ ”
2 Chronicles,21,16,The Lord stirred up the anger of the Philistines against Jehoram. He also stirred up the anger of the Arabs. They lived near the people of Cush.
2 Chronicles,21,17,The Philistines and Arabs attacked Judah. They went in and carried off all the goods they found in the king’s palace. They also took his sons and wives. The only son he had left was Ahaziah. He was the youngest son.
2 Chronicles,21,18,"After all of that, the Lord made Jehoram very sick. He couldn’t be healed."
2 Chronicles,21,19,"After he had been sick for two years, the sickness caused his insides to come out. He died in great pain. His people didn’t make a funeral fire to honor him. They had made funeral fires to honor the kings who ruled before him."
2 Chronicles,21,20,Jehoram was 32 years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for eight years. No one was sorry when he passed away. He was buried in the City of David. But he wasn’t placed in the tombs of the kings.
2 Chronicles,22,1,"The people of Jerusalem made Ahaziah king in place of Jehoram. Ahaziah was Jehoram’s youngest son. Robbers had come with the Arabs into Jehoram’s camp. The robbers had killed all his older sons. So Ahaziah, the king of Judah, began to rule. He was the son of Jehoram."
2 Chronicles,22,2,Ahaziah was 22 years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for one year. His mother’s name was Athaliah. She was a granddaughter of Omri.
2 Chronicles,22,3,Ahaziah also followed the ways of the royal family of Ahab. That’s because Ahaziah’s mother gave him bad advice. She told him to do what was wrong.
2 Chronicles,22,4,"So he did what was evil in the eyes of the Lord . He did what the family of Ahab had done. After Ahaziah’s father died, the members of Ahab’s family became his advisers. That’s what destroyed him."
2 Chronicles,22,5,"He also followed their advice when he joined forces with Joram, the king of Israel. They went to war against Hazael at Ramoth Gilead. Joram was the son of Ahab. Hazael was king of Aram. The soldiers of Aram wounded Joram."
2 Chronicles,22,6,"So he returned to Jezreel to give his wounds time to heal. His enemies had wounded him at Ramoth in his battle against Hazael, the king of Aram. Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram, went down to Jezreel. He went there to see Joram. That’s because Joram had been wounded. Ahaziah was king of Judah. Joram was the son of Ahab."
2 Chronicles,22,7,"Through Ahaziah’s visit to Joram, God caused Ahaziah to fall from power. When Ahaziah arrived, he rode out with Joram to meet Jehu, the son of Nimshi. The Lord had anointed Jehu to destroy the royal family of Ahab."
2 Chronicles,22,8,"So Jehu punished Ahab’s family, just as the Lord had told him to. While he was doing it, he found the officials of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah’s relatives. They had been serving Ahaziah. So Jehu killed them."
2 Chronicles,22,9,"Then he went to look for Ahaziah. Jehu’s men captured him while he was hiding in Samaria. Ahaziah was brought to Jehu and put to death. People buried him, because they said, “He was a grandson of Jehoshaphat, who followed the Lord with all his heart.” So no one in the royal family of Ahaziah was powerful enough to keep the kingdom."
2 Chronicles,22,10,Athaliah was Ahaziah’s mother. She saw that her son was dead. So she began to wipe out the whole royal family of Judah.
2 Chronicles,22,11,"But Jehosheba went and got Joash, the son of Ahaziah. Jehosheba was the daughter of King Jehoram. She stole Joash away from among the royal princes. All of them were about to be murdered. She put Joash and his nurse in a bedroom. Jehosheba, the daughter of King Jehoram, was the wife of Jehoiada the priest. She was also Ahaziah’s sister. So Jehosheba hid the child from Athaliah. That’s why Athaliah couldn’t kill him."
2 Chronicles,22,12,The child remained hidden with the priest and his wife at God’s temple for six years. Athaliah ruled over the land during that time.
2 Chronicles,23,1,"When Joash was seven years old, Jehoiada showed how strong he was. He made a covenant with the commanders of groups of 100 men. The commanders were Azariah son of Jeroham, Ishmael son of Jehohanan, Azariah son of Obed, Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat son of Zikri."
2 Chronicles,23,2,They went all through Judah. They gathered together the Levites and the leaders of Israelite families from all the towns. They came to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,23,3,"The whole community made a covenant with the new king at God’s temple. Jehoiada said to them, “Ahaziah’s son will rule over Judah. That’s what the Lord promised concerning the family line of David."
2 Chronicles,23,4,Here’s what I want you to do. A third of you priests and Levites who are going on duty on the Sabbath day must guard the doors.
2 Chronicles,23,5,A third of you must guard the royal palace. And a third of you must guard the Foundation Gate. All the other men must guard the courtyards of the Lord ’s temple.
2 Chronicles,23,6,Don’t let anyone enter the temple except the priests and Levites who are on duty. They can enter because they are set apart to the Lord . But all the other men must obey the Lord ’s command not to enter.
2 Chronicles,23,7,The Levites must station themselves around the new king. Each man must have his weapon in his hand. Anyone else who enters the temple must be put to death. Stay close to the king no matter where he goes.”
2 Chronicles,23,8,The Levites did just as Jehoiada the priest ordered. So did all the men of Judah. Each commander got his men. Some of the men were going on duty on the Sabbath day. Others were going off duty. Jehoiada didn’t let any of the groups go.
2 Chronicles,23,9,"Then he gave weapons to the commanders of the groups. He gave them spears, large shields and small shields. The weapons had belonged to King David. They had been in God’s temple."
2 Chronicles,23,10,Jehoiada stationed all the men around the new king. Each man had his weapon in his hand. They were standing near the altar and the temple. They stood from the south side of the temple to its north side.
2 Chronicles,23,11,"Jehoiada and his sons brought Ahaziah’s son out. They put the crown on him. They gave him a copy of the covenant. And they announced that he was king. They anointed him. Then they shouted, “May the king live a long time!”"
2 Chronicles,23,12,Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and cheering the new king. So she went to them at the Lord ’s temple.
2 Chronicles,23,13,"She looked, and there was the king! He was standing next to his pillar at the entrance. The officers and trumpet players were standing beside the king. All the people of the land were filled with joy. They were blowing trumpets. Musicians with their musical instruments were leading the songs of praise. Then Athaliah tore her royal robes. She shouted, “Treason! It’s treason!”"
2 Chronicles,23,14,"Jehoiada the priest sent out the commanders of the groups of 100 men. They were in charge of the troops. He said to them, “Bring her away from the temple between the line of guards. Use your swords to kill anyone who follows her.” The priest had said, “Don’t put her to death at the Lord ’s temple.”"
2 Chronicles,23,15,So they grabbed her as she reached the entrance of the Horse Gate on the palace grounds. There they put her to death.
2 Chronicles,23,16,"Then Jehoiada made a covenant. He promised that he, the people and the king would be the Lord ’s people."
2 Chronicles,23,17,All the people went to Baal’s temple. They tore it down. They smashed the altars and the statues of gods. They killed Mattan in front of the altars. He was the priest of Baal.
2 Chronicles,23,18,"Then Jehoiada put the priests, who were Levites, in charge of the Lord ’s temple. David had given them their duties in the temple. He had appointed them to sacrifice burnt offerings to the Lord . He wanted them to do it in keeping with what was written in the Law of Moses. David wanted them to sing and be full of joy."
2 Chronicles,23,19,Jehoiada stationed guards at the gates of the Lord ’s temple. No one who was “unclean” in any way could enter.
2 Chronicles,23,20,"Jehoiada took with him the commanders of hundreds, the nobles, the rulers of the people, and all the people of the land. He brought the new king down from the Lord ’s temple. They went into the palace through the Upper Gate. Then they seated the king on the royal throne."
2 Chronicles,23,21,All the people of the land were filled with joy. And the city was calm. That’s because Athaliah had been killed by a sword.
2 Chronicles,24,1,Joash was seven years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for 40 years. His mother’s name was Zibiah. She was from Beersheba.
2 Chronicles,24,2,Joash did what was right in the eyes of the Lord . Joash lived that way as long as Jehoiada the priest was alive.
2 Chronicles,24,3,Jehoiada chose two wives for Joash. They had sons and daughters by Joash.
2 Chronicles,24,4,Some time later Joash decided to make the Lord ’s temple look like new again.
2 Chronicles,24,5,"He called together the priests and Levites. He said to them, “Go to the towns of Judah. Collect the money that the nation of Israel owes every year. Use it to repair the temple of your God. Do it now.” But the Levites didn’t do it right away."
2 Chronicles,24,6,"So the king sent for Jehoiada the chief priest. He said to him, “Why haven’t you required the Levites to bring in the tax from Judah and Jerusalem? It was set up by the Lord ’s servant Moses and the whole community of Israel. It was used for the tent where the tablets of the covenant law were kept.”"
2 Chronicles,24,7,The children of that evil woman Athaliah had broken into God’s temple. They had used even its sacred objects for the gods that were named Baal.
2 Chronicles,24,8,King Joash commanded that a wooden chest be made. It was placed outside near the gate of the Lord ’s temple.
2 Chronicles,24,9,Then a message went out in Judah and Jerusalem. It said that the people should bring the tax to the Lord . God’s servant Moses had required Israel to pay that tax when they were in the desert.
2 Chronicles,24,10,All the officials and people gladly brought their money. They dropped it into the chest until it was full.
2 Chronicles,24,11,"The chest was brought in by the Levites to the king’s officials. Every time the officials saw there was a large amount of money in the chest, it was emptied out. The royal secretary and the officer of the chief priest came and emptied it. Then they carried it back to its place. They did it regularly. They collected a great amount of money."
2 Chronicles,24,12,The king and Jehoiada gave it to the people who were doing the work on the Lord ’s temple. They hired people who could lay the stones and people who could work with wood. They also hired people who could work with iron and bronze. They hired all of them to repair the temple.
2 Chronicles,24,13,The men in charge of the work did their best. The repairs went very well under them. They rebuilt God’s temple. They did it in keeping with its original plans. They made the temple even stronger.
2 Chronicles,24,14,"So they finished the work. Then they brought the rest of the money to the king and Jehoiada. It was used to pay for the objects that were made for the Lord ’s temple. The objects were used for serving at the temple. They were also used for the burnt offerings. The objects included dishes and other things made out of gold and silver. As long as Jehoiada lived, burnt offerings were sacrificed continually at the Lord ’s temple."
2 Chronicles,24,15,Jehoiada had become very old. He died at the age of 130.
2 Chronicles,24,16,He was buried with the kings in the City of David. That’s because he had done so many good things in Israel for God and his temple.
2 Chronicles,24,17,"After Jehoiada died, the officials of Judah came to King Joash. They bowed down to him. He listened to them."
2 Chronicles,24,18,"They turned their backs on the temple of the Lord , the God of their people. They worshiped poles made to honor the female god named Asherah. They also worshiped statues of other gods. Because Judah and Jerusalem were guilty of sin, God became angry with them."
2 Chronicles,24,19,The Lord sent prophets to the people to bring them back to him. The prophets told the people what they were doing wrong. But the people wouldn’t listen.
2 Chronicles,24,20,"Then the Spirit of God came on Zechariah the priest. He was the son of Jehoiada. Zechariah stood in front of the people. He told them, “God says, ‘Why do you refuse to obey my commands? You will not have success. You have deserted me. So I have deserted you.’ ”"
2 Chronicles,24,21,But the people made evil plans against Zechariah. The king ordered them to kill Zechariah by throwing stones at him. They did it in the courtyard of the Lord ’s temple.
2 Chronicles,24,22,"King Joash didn’t remember how kind Zechariah’s father Jehoiada had been to him. So he killed Jehoiada’s son. As Zechariah was dying he said, “May the Lord see this. May he hold you responsible.”"
2 Chronicles,24,23,"In the spring, the army of Aram marched into Judah and Jerusalem against Joash. They killed all the leaders of the people. They took a large amount of goods from Judah. They sent it to their king in Damascus."
2 Chronicles,24,24,"The army of Aram had come with only a few men. But the Lord allowed them to win the battle over a much larger army. Judah had deserted the Lord , the God of their people. That’s why the Lord punished Joash."
2 Chronicles,24,25,The army of Aram pulled back. They left Joash badly wounded. His officials planned to do evil things to him. That’s because he murdered the son of Jehoiada the priest. They killed Joash in his bed. So he died. He was buried in the City of David. But he wasn’t placed in the tombs of the kings.
2 Chronicles,24,26,Those who made the plans against Joash were Zabad and Jehozabad. Zabad was the son of Shimeath. She was from Ammon. Jehozabad was the son of Shimrith. She was from Moab.
2 Chronicles,24,27,The story of the sons of Joash is written in the notes on the records of the kings. The many prophecies about him are written there too. So is the record of how he made God’s temple look like new again. Joash’s son Amaziah became the next king after him.
2 Chronicles,25,1,Amaziah was 25 years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for 29 years. His mother’s name was Jehoaddan. She was from Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,25,2,Amaziah did what was right in the eyes of the Lord . But he didn’t do it with all his heart.
2 Chronicles,25,3,"The kingdom was firmly under his control. So he put to death the officials who had murdered his father, the king."
2 Chronicles,25,4,"But he didn’t put their children to death. He obeyed what is written in the Law, the Book of Moses. There the Lord commanded, “Parents must not be put to death because of what their children do. And children must not be put to death because of what their parents do. People must die because of their own sins.”( Deuteronomy 24:16)"
2 Chronicles,25,5,"Amaziah called the people of Judah together. He arranged them by families under commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds. He did it for all the people of Judah and Benjamin. Then he brought together the men who were 20 years old or more. He found out there were 300,000 men who were able to serve in the army. They could handle spears and shields."
2 Chronicles,25,6,"He also hired 100,000 fighting men from Israel. He had to pay them almost four tons of silver."
2 Chronicles,25,7,"But a man of God came to him. He said, “Your Majesty, these troops from Israel must not march out with you. The Lord is not with Israel. He isn’t with any of the people of Ephraim."
2 Chronicles,25,8,Go and fight bravely in battle if you want to. But God will destroy you right in front of your enemies. God has the power to help you or destroy you.”
2 Chronicles,25,9,"Amaziah asked the man of God, “But what about all that silver I paid for these Israelite troops?” The man of God replied, “The Lord can give you much more than that.”"
2 Chronicles,25,10,So Amaziah let the troops go who had come to him from Ephraim. He sent them home. They were very angry with Judah. They were still very angry when they went home.
2 Chronicles,25,11,"Then Amaziah showed how strong he was. He led his army to the Valley of Salt. There he killed 10,000 men of Seir."
2 Chronicles,25,12,"The army of Judah also captured 10,000 men alive. The army of Judah took them to the top of a cliff. Then they threw them down. All of them were smashed to pieces."
2 Chronicles,25,13,"The troops Amaziah had sent back attacked some towns that belonged to Judah. Amaziah hadn’t allowed the troops to take part in the war. They attacked towns from Samaria to Beth Horon. They killed 3,000 people. They carried off huge amounts of goods."
2 Chronicles,25,14,Amaziah returned from killing the men of Edom. He brought back the statues of the gods of Seir. He set them up as his own gods. He bowed down to them. He burned sacrifices to them.
2 Chronicles,25,15,"The Lord was very angry with Amaziah. He sent a prophet to him. The prophet said, “Why do you ask the gods of those people for advice? They couldn’t even save their own people from your power!”"
2 Chronicles,25,16,"While the prophet was still speaking, the king spoke to him. He said, “Did I ask you for advice? Stop! If you don’t, you will be struck down.” So the prophet stopped. But then he said, “I know that God has decided to destroy you. That’s because you have worshiped other gods. You haven’t listened to my advice.”"
2 Chronicles,25,17,"Amaziah, the king of Judah, spoke to his advisers. Then he sent a message to Jehoash, the king of Israel. Jehoash was the son of Jehoahaz. Jehoahaz was the son of Jehu. Amaziah dared Jehoash, “Come on! Let us face each other in battle!”"
2 Chronicles,25,18,"But Jehoash, the king of Israel, answered Amaziah, the king of Judah. Jehoash said, “A thorn bush in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar tree there. The thorn bush said, ‘Give your daughter to be married to my son.’ Then a wild animal in Lebanon came along. It crushed the thorn bush by walking on it."
2 Chronicles,25,19,You brag that you have won the battle over Edom. You are very proud. But stay home! Why ask for trouble? Why bring yourself crashing down? Why bring Judah down with you?”
2 Chronicles,25,20,"But Amaziah wouldn’t listen. That’s because God had planned to hand Judah over to Jehoash. After all, they had asked the gods of Edom for advice."
2 Chronicles,25,21,"So Jehoash, the king of Israel, attacked. He and Amaziah, the king of Judah, faced each other in battle. The battle took place at Beth Shemesh in Judah."
2 Chronicles,25,22,Israel drove Judah away. Every man ran home.
2 Chronicles,25,23,Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah at Beth Shemesh. Amaziah was the son of Joash. Joash was the son of Ahaziah. Jehoash brought Amaziah to Jerusalem. Jehoash broke down part of its wall. It’s the part that went from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate. That part of the wall was 600 feet long.
2 Chronicles,25,24,Jehoash took all the gold and silver. He took all the objects he found in God’s temple. Obed-Edom had been in charge of them. Jehoash also took the palace treasures and the prisoners. Then he returned to Samaria.
2 Chronicles,25,25,Amaziah king of Judah lived for 15 years after Jehoash king of Israel died. Amaziah was the son of Joash. Jehoash was the son of Jehoahaz.
2 Chronicles,25,26,The other events of Amaziah’s rule from beginning to end are written down. They are written in the records of the kings of Judah and Israel.
2 Chronicles,25,27,"Amaziah turned away from obeying the Lord . From that time on, some people made evil plans against him in Jerusalem. So he ran away to Lachish. But they sent men after him to Lachish. There they killed him."
2 Chronicles,25,28,"His body was brought back on a horse to Jerusalem, the City of Judah. There he was buried in the family tomb."
2 Chronicles,26,1,All the people of Judah made Uzziah king. He was 16 years old. They made him king in place of his father Amaziah.
2 Chronicles,26,2,Uzziah rebuilt Elath. He brought it under Judah’s control again. He did it after Amaziah joined the members of his family who had already died.
2 Chronicles,26,3,Uzziah was 16 years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for 52 years. His mother’s name was Jekoliah. She was from Jerusalem.

2 Chronicles,26,6,"Uzziah went to war against the Philistines. He broke down the walls of Gath, Jabneh and Ashdod. Then he rebuilt some towns that were near Ashdod. He also rebuilt some other towns where Philistines lived."
2 Chronicles,26,7,God helped him fight against the Philistines. He also helped him fight against the Meunites and against the Arabs who lived in Gur Baal.
2 Chronicles,26,8,The Ammonites brought to Uzziah the gifts he required of them. He became famous all the way to the border of Egypt. That’s because he had become very powerful.
2 Chronicles,26,9,"Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem. They were at the Corner Gate, the Valley Gate and the angle of the wall. He made the towers very strong."
2 Chronicles,26,10,"He also built towers in the desert. He dug many wells, because he had a lot of livestock. The livestock were in the western hills and on the plains. Uzziah had people working in his fields and vineyards in the hills and in the rich lands. That’s because he loved the soil."
2 Chronicles,26,11,Uzziah’s army was well trained. It was ready to march out by military groups according to their numbers. Jeiel and Maaseiah brought them together. Jeiel was the secretary. Maaseiah was the officer. They were under the direction of Hananiah. He was one of the royal officials.
2 Chronicles,26,12,"The total number of family leaders who were over the fighting men was 2,600."
2 Chronicles,26,13,"An army of 307,500 men was under their command. The men were trained for war. They were a powerful force. They helped the king against his enemies."
2 Chronicles,26,14,"Uzziah provided the entire army with shields, spears, helmets, coats of armor, bows, and stones for their slings."
2 Chronicles,26,15,In Jerusalem he invented machines to be used on the towers and on the corners of city walls. These machines were used by men who shot arrows from the walls. The machines were also used by men to throw large stones from the walls. Uzziah became famous everywhere. God greatly helped him until he became powerful.
2 Chronicles,26,16,"But after Uzziah became powerful, his pride brought him down. He wasn’t faithful to the Lord his God. He entered the Lord ’s temple to burn incense on the altar for burning incense."
2 Chronicles,26,17,Azariah the priest followed him in. So did 80 other brave priests of the Lord.
2 Chronicles,26,18,"They stood up to Uzziah. They said, “Uzziah, it isn’t right for you to burn incense to the Lord . Only the priests are supposed to do that. They are members of the family line of Aaron. They have been set apart to burn incense. So get out of here. Leave the temple. You haven’t been faithful. The Lord God won’t honor you.”"
2 Chronicles,26,19,"Uzziah was holding a shallow cup. He was ready to burn incense in it. He became angry. He shouted at the priests in the Lord ’s temple. He did it near the altar for burning incense. While he was shouting, a skin disease suddenly broke out on his forehead."
2 Chronicles,26,20,"Azariah the chief priest and all the other priests looked at him. They saw that Uzziah had a skin disease on his forehead. So they hurried him out of the temple. Actually, he himself really wanted to leave. He knew that the Lord was making him suffer."
2 Chronicles,26,21,King Uzziah had the skin disease until the day he died. He lived in a separate house because he had the disease. And he wasn’t allowed to enter the Lord ’s temple. Uzziah’s son Jotham was in charge of the palace. Jotham ruled over the people of the land.
2 Chronicles,26,22,The other events of Uzziah’s rule from beginning to end were written down by Isaiah the prophet. Isaiah was the son of Amoz.
2 Chronicles,26,23,"Uzziah joined the members of his family who had already died. He was buried near them in a royal burial ground. People said, “He had a skin disease.” Uzziah’s son Jotham became the next king after him."

2 Chronicles,27,3,Jotham rebuilt the Upper Gate of the Lord ’s temple. He did a lot of work on the wall at the hill of Ophel.
2 Chronicles,27,4,He built towns in the hill country of Judah. He also built forts and towers in areas that had a lot of trees in them.
2 Chronicles,27,5,"Jotham went to war against the king of Ammon. He won the battle over the Ammonites. That year they paid Jotham almost four tons of silver. They paid him 1,800 tons of wheat and 1,500 tons of barley. They also brought him the same amount in the second and third years."
2 Chronicles,27,6,Jotham became powerful. That’s because he had worshiped the Lord his God with all his heart.
2 Chronicles,27,7,The other events of Jotham’s rule are written down. That includes all his wars and the other things he did. All these things are written in the records of the kings of Israel and Judah.

2 Chronicles,27,9,Jotham joined the members of his family who had already died. He was buried in the City of David. Jotham’s son Ahaz became the next king after him.
2 Chronicles,28,1,Ahaz was 20 years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for 16 years. He didn’t do what was right in the eyes of the Lord . He didn’t do what King David had done.
2 Chronicles,28,2,He followed the ways of the kings of Israel. He also made statues of gods that were named Baal.
2 Chronicles,28,3,He burned sacrifices in the Valley of Ben Hinnom. He sacrificed his children in the fire to other gods. He followed the practices of the nations. The Lord hates these practices. The Lord had driven out those nations to make room for the people of Israel.
2 Chronicles,28,4,Ahaz offered sacrifices and burned incense at the high places. He also did it on the tops of hills and under every green tree.
2 Chronicles,28,5,So the Lord his God handed him over to the king of Aram. The men of Aram won the battle over him. They took many of his people as prisoners. They brought them to Damascus. God also handed Ahaz over to Pekah. Pekah was king of Israel. His army wounded or killed many of the troops of Ahaz.
2 Chronicles,28,6,"In one day Pekah, the son of Remaliah, killed 120,000 soldiers in Judah. That’s because Judah had deserted the Lord , the God of their people."
2 Chronicles,28,7,"Zikri was a fighting man from Ephraim. He killed Maaseiah, Azrikam and Elkanah. Maaseiah was the king’s son. Azrikam was the officer who was in charge of the palace. And Elkanah was next in command after the king."
2 Chronicles,28,8,"The men of Israel captured 200,000 wives, sons and daughters from their relatives in Judah. They also took a large amount of goods. They carried all of it back to Samaria."
2 Chronicles,28,9,"But a prophet of the Lord was there. His name was Oded. When the army returned to Samaria, he went out to meet them. He said to them, “The Lord is the God of your people. He was very angry with Judah. So he handed them over to you. But you have killed them. Your anger reached all the way to heaven."
2 Chronicles,28,10,Now you are planning to make the men and women of Judah and Jerusalem your slaves. But aren’t you also guilty of sins against the Lord your God?
2 Chronicles,28,11,Listen to me! You have taken your relatives from Judah as prisoners. The Lord is very angry with you. So send your relatives back.”
2 Chronicles,28,12,"Then some of the leaders in Ephraim stood up to those who were returning from the war. The leaders were Azariah, Berekiah, Jehizkiah and Amasa. Azariah was the son of Jehohanan. Berekiah was the son of Meshillemoth. Jehizkiah was the son of Shallum. And Amasa was the son of Hadlai."
2 Chronicles,28,13,"“Don’t bring those prisoners here,” they said. “If you do, we’ll be guilty in the sight of the Lord . Do you really want to add to our sin and guilt? We’re already very guilty. The Lord is very angry with Israel.”"
2 Chronicles,28,14,So the soldiers gave up the prisoners and the goods they had taken. They did it in front of the officials and the whole community.
2 Chronicles,28,15,"Azariah, Berekiah, Jehizkiah and Amasa received the prisoners. From the goods that had been taken, they gave clothes to everyone who was naked. They gave them clothes, sandals, food, drink and healing lotion. They put all the weak people on donkeys. They took them back to their relatives at Jericho. Then they returned to Samaria. Jericho was also known as the City of Palm Trees."
2 Chronicles,28,16,At that time King Ahaz sent men to the king of Assyria to get help.
2 Chronicles,28,17,The men of Edom had come and attacked Judah again. They had carried away prisoners.
2 Chronicles,28,18,"At the same time the Philistines had attacked towns in the western hills and in the Negev Desert of Judah. They had captured Beth Shemesh, Aijalon and Gederoth. They had also captured Soko, Timnah and Gimzo and the villages around them. They had settled down in all of them."
2 Chronicles,28,19,"The Lord had made Judah less powerful because of Ahaz, their king. Ahaz had stirred up the people of Judah to do evil things. He hadn’t been faithful to the Lord at all."
2 Chronicles,28,20,Tiglath-Pileser came to Ahaz. But he gave Ahaz trouble instead of help. Tiglath-Pileser was king of Assyria.
2 Chronicles,28,21,Ahaz took some things from the Lord ’s temple. He also took some from the royal palace and from the officials. He gave all of them to the king of Assyria. But that didn’t help Ahaz.
2 Chronicles,28,22,"When King Ahaz was in trouble, he became even more unfaithful to the Lord."
2 Chronicles,28,23,"Ahaz offered sacrifices to the gods of Damascus. They had won the battle over him. Ahaz thought, “The gods of the kings of Aram have helped them. So I’ll sacrifice to those gods. Then they’ll help me.” But those gods only caused his ruin. In fact, those gods caused the ruin of the whole nation of Israel."
2 Chronicles,28,24,Ahaz gathered together everything that belonged to God’s temple. He cut all of it in pieces. Ahaz shut the doors of the Lord ’s temple. He set up altars at every street corner in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,28,25,"In every town in Judah he built high places. Sacrifices were burned there to other gods. That made the Lord , the God of his people, very angry."
2 Chronicles,28,26,The other events of the rule of Ahaz and all his evil practices from beginning to end are written down. They are written in the records of the kings of Judah and Israel.
2 Chronicles,28,27,Ahaz joined the members of his family who had already died. He was buried in the city of Jerusalem. But he wasn’t placed in the tombs of the kings of Israel. Ahaz’s son Hezekiah became the next king after him.
2 Chronicles,29,1,Hezekiah was 25 years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for 29 years. His mother’s name was Abijah. She was the daughter of Zechariah.
2 Chronicles,29,2,"Hezekiah did what was right in the eyes of the Lord , just as King David had done."
2 Chronicles,29,3,"In the first month of Hezekiah’s first year as king, he opened the doors of the Lord ’s temple. He repaired them."
2 Chronicles,29,4,He brought the priests and Levites in. He gathered them together in the open area on the east side of the temple.
2 Chronicles,29,5,"He said, “Levites, listen to me! Set yourselves apart to the Lord . Set apart the temple of the Lord . He’s the God of your people who lived long ago. Remove anything ‘unclean’ from the temple."
2 Chronicles,29,6,Our people weren’t faithful. They did what was evil in the eyes of the Lord our God. They deserted him. They turned their faces away from the place where he lives. They turned their backs on him.
2 Chronicles,29,7,They also shut the doors of the temple porch. They put the lamps out. They didn’t burn incense at the temple. They didn’t sacrifice burnt offerings there to the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles,29,8,So the Lord has become angry with Judah and Jerusalem. He has made them look so bad that everyone is shocked when they see them. They laugh at them. You can see it with your own eyes.
2 Chronicles,29,9,That’s why our fathers have been killed by swords. That’s why our sons and daughters and wives have become prisoners.

2 Chronicles,29,11,"My sons, don’t fail to obey the Lord . He has chosen you to stand in front of him and work for him. He wants you to serve him and burn incense to him.”"

2 Chronicles,29,15,All these Levites gathered the other Levites together. They set themselves apart to the Lord . Then they went in to purify the Lord ’s temple. That’s what the king had ordered them to do. They did what the Lord told them to.
2 Chronicles,29,16,The priests went into the Lord ’s temple to make it pure. They brought out to the temple courtyard everything that was “unclean.” They had found “unclean” things in the Lord ’s temple. The Levites took them and carried them out to the Kidron Valley.
2 Chronicles,29,17,On the first day of the first month they began to set everything in the temple apart to the Lord . By the eighth day of the month they reached the Lord ’s porch. For eight more days they set the Lord ’s temple itself apart to him. They finished on the 16th day of the first month.
2 Chronicles,29,18,"Then they went to King Hezekiah. They reported, “We’ve purified the whole temple of the Lord . That includes the altar for burnt offerings and all its tools. It also includes the table for the holy bread and all its objects."
2 Chronicles,29,19,We’ve prepared all the things King Ahaz had removed. We’ve set them apart to the Lord . Ahaz had removed them while he was king. He wasn’t faithful to the Lord . Those things are now in front of the Lord ’s altar.”
2 Chronicles,29,20,Early the next morning King Hezekiah gathered together the city officials. They all went up to the Lord ’s temple.
2 Chronicles,29,21,"They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven male lambs and seven male goats with them. They sacrificed the animals as a sin offering for the kingdom, for the temple and for Judah. The king commanded the priests to offer them on the Lord ’s altar. The priests were from the family line of Aaron."
2 Chronicles,29,22,They killed the bulls. Then they splashed the blood against the altar. Next they killed the rams and splashed the blood against the altar. Then they killed the lambs and splashed the blood against the altar.
2 Chronicles,29,23,The goats for the sin offering were brought to the king and the whole community. They placed their hands on them.
2 Chronicles,29,24,Then the priests killed the goats. They put the blood on the altar as a sin offering. It paid for the sin of the whole nation of Israel. The king had ordered the burnt offering and the sin offering for the whole nation.
2 Chronicles,29,25,"Hezekiah stationed the Levites in the Lord ’s temple. They had cymbals, harps and lyres. They did everything in the way King David, his prophet Gad, and Nathan the prophet had required. The Lord had given commands about all these things through his prophets."
2 Chronicles,29,26,So the Levites stood ready with David’s musical instruments. And the priests had their trumpets ready.
2 Chronicles,29,27,Hezekiah gave the order to sacrifice the burnt offering on the altar. The offering began. Singing to the Lord also began. The singing was accompanied by the trumpets and by the instruments of David. He had been king of Israel.
2 Chronicles,29,28,The whole community bowed down. They worshiped the Lord . At the same time the musicians played their musical instruments. The priests blew their trumpets. All of that continued until the burnt offering had been sacrificed.
2 Chronicles,29,29,So the offerings were finished. King Hezekiah got down on his knees. He worshiped the Lord . So did everyone who was with him.
2 Chronicles,29,30,The king and his officials ordered the Levites to praise the Lord . They used the words of David and Asaph the prophet. They sang praises with joy. They bowed down and worshiped the Lord.
2 Chronicles,29,31,"Then Hezekiah said, “You have set yourselves apart to the Lord . Come and bring sacrifices and thank offerings to his temple.” So the whole community brought sacrifices and thank offerings. Everyone who wanted to brought burnt offerings."
2 Chronicles,29,32,"The whole community brought 70 bulls, 100 rams and 200 male lambs. They brought all of them as burnt offerings to the Lord."
2 Chronicles,29,33,"The total number of animals set apart as sacrifices to the Lord was 600 bulls and 3,000 sheep and goats."
2 Chronicles,29,34,"But there weren’t enough priests to skin all the burnt offerings. So their relatives, the Levites, helped them. They worked until the task was finished. By that time other priests had been set apart to the Lord . The Levites had been more careful than the priests when they set themselves apart."
2 Chronicles,29,35,"There were large numbers of burnt offerings, along with the drink offerings and the fat from the friendship offerings. They were offered along with the burnt offerings. So the service of the Lord ’s temple was started up again."
2 Chronicles,29,36,Hezekiah and all the people were filled with joy. That’s because everything had been done so quickly. God had provided for his people in a wonderful way.
2 Chronicles,30,1,Hezekiah sent a message to all the people of Israel and Judah. He also wrote letters to the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh. He invited everyone to come to the Lord ’s temple in Jerusalem. He wanted them to celebrate the Passover Feast to honor the Lord . He is the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles,30,2,"The king, his officials and the whole community in Jerusalem decided to celebrate the Passover Feast in the second month."
2 Chronicles,30,3,"They hadn’t been able to celebrate it at the regular time. That’s because there weren’t enough priests who had set themselves apart to the Lord . Also, the people hadn’t gathered together in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,30,4,The plan seemed good to the king and the whole community.
2 Chronicles,30,5,"They decided to send a message all through Israel. It was sent out from Beersheba all the way to Dan. The message invited the people to come to Jerusalem. It invited them to celebrate the Passover Feast to honor the Lord , the God of Israel. The Passover Feast hadn’t been celebrated by large numbers of people for a long time. It hadn’t been done in keeping with what was written in the law."
2 Chronicles,30,6,"Messengers went all through Israel and Judah. They carried letters from the king and his officials. The king had ordered them to do that. The letters said, “People of Israel, return to the Lord . He is the God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel. Return to him. Then he will return to you who are left in the land. You have escaped from the power of the kings of Assyria."
2 Chronicles,30,7,"Don’t be like your parents and the rest of your people. They weren’t faithful to the Lord , the God of their people. That’s why he punished them. He made them look so bad that everyone was shocked when they saw them. You can see it for yourselves."
2 Chronicles,30,8,Don’t be stubborn. Don’t be as your people were. Obey the Lord . Come to his temple. He has set it apart to himself forever. Serve the Lord your God. Then he’ll stop being angry with you.
2 Chronicles,30,9,"Suppose you return to the Lord . Then those who captured your relatives and children will be kind to them. In fact, your relatives and children will come back to this land. The Lord your God is kind and tender. He won’t turn away from you if you return to him.”"
2 Chronicles,30,10,The messengers went from town to town in Ephraim and Manasseh. They went all the way to Zebulun. But people laughed and made fun of them.
2 Chronicles,30,11,"In spite of that, some people from Asher, Manasseh and Zebulun made themselves humble. They went to Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,30,12,God helped the people of Judah. He helped them agree with one another. So they did what the king and his officials had ordered. They did what the Lord told them to do.
2 Chronicles,30,13,A very large crowd of people gathered together in Jerusalem. They went there to celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread. It took place in the second month.
2 Chronicles,30,14,They removed the altars in Jerusalem. They cleared away the altars for burning incense. They threw all the altars into the Kidron Valley.
2 Chronicles,30,15,They killed the Passover lamb on the 14th day of the second month. The priests and Levites were ashamed of how they had lived. They set themselves apart to the Lord . They brought burnt offerings to his temple.
2 Chronicles,30,16,"Then they did their regular tasks just as the Law of Moses, the man of God, required. The Levites gave the blood of the animals to the priests. The priests splashed it against the altar."
2 Chronicles,30,17,Many people in the crowd hadn’t set themselves apart to the Lord . They weren’t “clean.” They couldn’t set apart their lambs to him. So the Levites had to kill the Passover lambs for all of them.
2 Chronicles,30,18,"Many people came from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun. Most of them hadn’t made themselves pure and “clean.” But they still ate the Passover meal. That was against what was written in the law. But Hezekiah prayed for them. He said, “The Lord is good. May he forgive everyone"
2 Chronicles,30,19,"who wants to worship God with all their heart. God is the Lord , the God of their people. May God forgive them even if they aren’t ‘clean’ in keeping with the rules of the temple.”"
2 Chronicles,30,20,The Lord answered Hezekiah’s prayer. He healed the people.
2 Chronicles,30,21,The people of Israel who were in Jerusalem celebrated the Feast of Unleavened Bread. They celebrated for seven days with great joy. The Levites and priests praised the Lord every day. They praised the Lord with loud musical instruments. The instruments had been set apart to the Lord.
2 Chronicles,30,22,"Hezekiah spoke words that gave hope to all the Levites. They understood how to serve the Lord well. For the seven days of the feast they ate the share given to them. They also sacrificed friendship offerings. They praised the Lord , the God of their people."
2 Chronicles,30,23,Then the whole community agreed to celebrate the feast for seven more days. So for another seven days they celebrated with joy.
2 Chronicles,30,24,"Hezekiah, the king of Judah, provided 1,000 bulls and 7,000 sheep and goats for the community. The officials provided 1,000 bulls and 10,000 sheep and goats for them. A large number of priests set themselves apart to the Lord."
2 Chronicles,30,25,The entire community of Judah was filled with joy. So were the priests and Levites. And so were all the people who had gathered together from Israel. That included the outsiders who had come from Israel. It also included those who lived in Judah.
2 Chronicles,30,26,"There was great joy in Jerusalem. There hadn’t been anything like it in Israel since the days of Solomon, the son of David. Solomon had been king of Israel."
2 Chronicles,30,27,The priests and Levites gave their blessing to the people. God heard them. Their prayer reached all the way to heaven. It’s the holy place where God lives.
2 Chronicles,31,1,The Passover Feast came to an end. The people of Israel who were in Jerusalem went out to the towns of Judah. They smashed the sacred stones. They cut down the poles used to worship the female god named Asherah. They destroyed the high places and the altars. They did those things all through Judah and Benjamin. They also did them in Ephraim and Manasseh. They destroyed all the objects used to worship other gods. Then the Israelites returned to their own towns and property.
2 Chronicles,31,2,Hezekiah put the priests and Levites in groups based on their duties. The priests sacrificed burnt offerings and friendship offerings. The Levites served the Lord by giving thanks and singing praises at the gates of his house.
2 Chronicles,31,3,The king gave some of his own possessions to the temple. He gave them for the morning and evening burnt offerings. He gave them for the burnt offerings for every Sabbath day. He gave them for the burnt offerings for every New Moon feast. And he gave them for the burnt offerings for every yearly appointed feast. He did it in keeping with what is written in the Law of the Lord.
2 Chronicles,31,4,Hezekiah gave an order to the people who were living in Jerusalem. He commanded them to give to the priests and Levites the share they owed them. Then the priests and Levites could give their full attention to the Law of the Lord.
2 Chronicles,31,5,"The order went out. Right away the people of Israel began to give freely. They gave the first share of the harvest of their grain, fresh wine, olive oil and honey. They also gave the first share of everything else their fields produced. They brought a large amount. It was a tenth of everything."
2 Chronicles,31,6,Here is what the people of Israel and Judah who lived in the towns of Judah brought. They brought a tenth of their herds and flocks. They also brought a tenth of the holy things they had set apart to the Lord their God. They put them in piles.
2 Chronicles,31,7,They began doing it in the third month. They finished in the seventh month.
2 Chronicles,31,8,"Hezekiah and his officials came and saw the piles. When they did, they praised the Lord . And they blessed his people Israel."
2 Chronicles,31,9,Hezekiah asked the priests and Levites about the piles.
2 Chronicles,31,10,"Azariah the chief priest answered him. He said, “The people have been bringing their gifts to the Lord ’s temple. Ever since they began to bring them, we’ve had enough to eat. We have even had plenty to spare. That’s because the Lord has blessed his people. So we have a large amount left over.” Azariah was from the family line of Zadok."
2 Chronicles,31,11,Hezekiah gave orders to prepare storerooms in the Lord ’s temple. And it was done.
2 Chronicles,31,12,The people were faithful. They brought in their offerings and a tenth of everything they produced. They also brought the gifts they had set apart to the Lord . Konaniah the Levite was in charge of everything they brought. His brother Shimei was next in command after him.
2 Chronicles,31,13,"Konaniah and his brother Shimei had helpers who worked with them. Their names were Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismakiah, Mahath and Benaiah. King Hezekiah and Azariah had appointed them. Azariah was the official in charge of God’s temple."
2 Chronicles,31,14,Kore the Levite guarded the East Gate. He was in charge of the offerings people chose to give to God. He handed out the offerings made to the Lord . He also handed out the gifts that had been set apart to the Lord . Kore was the son of Imnah.
2 Chronicles,31,15,"Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah and Shekaniah helped Kore. They were faithful in helping him in the towns of the priests. They handed out gifts to their brother priests, group by group. They gave the gifts to old men and young men alike."
2 Chronicles,31,16,"In addition to that, they handed out gifts to the males who were three years old or more. The names of those males were listed in their family history. All of them would enter the Lord ’s temple. They would carry out their duties each day. Each group did all the different things it was supposed to do."
2 Chronicles,31,17,Kore and his Levite companions also handed out gifts to the priests. The priests were listed by their families in their family history. Those Levites also handed out gifts to the Levites who were 20 years old or more. Each group did all the different things it was supposed to do.
2 Chronicles,31,18,"Those groups included all the little ones, the wives, and the sons and daughters of the whole community. All of them were listed in their family history. They were faithful in setting themselves apart to serve the Lord."
2 Chronicles,31,19,Some of the priests lived in other towns or on farms around their towns. They were from the family line of Aaron. Men were chosen by name to hand out shares to those priests. They gave a share to every male among them. They also gave a share to everyone whose name was written down in the family history of the Levites.
2 Chronicles,31,20,That’s what Hezekiah did all through Judah. He did what was good and right. He was faithful to the Lord his God.
2 Chronicles,31,21,He tried to obey his God. He worked for him with all his heart. That’s the way he worked in everything he did to serve God’s temple. He obeyed the law. He followed the Lord ’s commands. So he had success.
2 Chronicles,32,1,"Hezekiah had been completely faithful to the Lord . However, Sennacherib king of Assyria came and marched into Judah. Sennacherib surrounded the cities that had high walls around them. He got ready to attack them. He thought he could win the battle over them. He thought he could take them for himself."
2 Chronicles,32,2,Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come to Jerusalem to fight against it.
2 Chronicles,32,3,So he asked his officials and military leaders for advice. He asked them about blocking off the water from the springs outside the city. They gave him the advice he asked for.
2 Chronicles,32,4,They gathered together a large group of people. They blocked all the springs. They also blocked the stream that flowed through the land. “Why should the kings of Assyria come and find plenty of water?” they asked.
2 Chronicles,32,5,Then Hezekiah worked hard repairing all the broken parts of the wall. He built towers on it. He built another wall outside that one. He built up the areas that had been filled in around the City of David. He also made large numbers of weapons and shields.
2 Chronicles,32,6,"He appointed military officers over the people. He gathered the officers together in front of him in the open area at the city gate. He gave them words of hope. He said,"
2 Chronicles,32,7,“Be strong. Be brave. Don’t be afraid. Don’t lose hope. The king of Assyria has a huge army with him. But there’s a greater power with us than there is with him.
2 Chronicles,32,8,"The only thing he has is human strength. But the Lord our God is with us. He will help us. He’ll fight our battles.” The people had great faith in what Hezekiah, the king of Judah, said."
2 Chronicles,32,9,"Later Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, and all his forces surrounded Lachish. They prepared to attack it. At that time, Sennacherib sent his officers to Jerusalem. They went there with a message for Hezekiah, the king of Judah. The message was also for all the people of Judah who were there. The message said,"
2 Chronicles,32,10,"“Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, says, ‘Why are you putting your faith in what your king says? Why do you remain in Jerusalem when you are surrounded?"
2 Chronicles,32,11,"Hezekiah says, “The Lord our God will save us from the power of the king of Assyria.” But he isn’t telling you the truth. If you listen to him, you will die of hunger and thirst."
2 Chronicles,32,12,"Didn’t Hezekiah himself remove your god’s high places and altars? Didn’t Hezekiah say to the people of Judah and Jerusalem, “You must worship at one altar. You must burn sacrifices on it”?"
2 Chronicles,32,13,“ ‘Don’t you know what I and the kings who ruled before me have done? Don’t you know what we’ve done to all the peoples of the other lands? Were the gods of those nations ever able to save their lands from my power?
2 Chronicles,32,14,The kings who ruled before me destroyed many nations. Which one of the gods of those nations has been able to save his people from me? So how can your god save you from my power?
2 Chronicles,32,15,Don’t let Hezekiah trick you. He’s telling you lies. Don’t believe him. No god of any nation or kingdom has been able to save his people from my power. No god has been able to save his people from the power of the kings who ruled before me. So your god won’t save you from my power either!’ ”
2 Chronicles,32,16,Sennacherib’s officers spoke even more things against the Lord God and his servant Hezekiah.
2 Chronicles,32,17,"The king also wrote letters against the Lord . His letters made fun of the God of Israel. They said, “The peoples of other lands have their gods. But those gods didn’t save their people from my power. So the god of Hezekiah won’t save his people from my power either.”"
2 Chronicles,32,18,Then the officers called out in the Hebrew language to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall. They were trying to scare them and make them afraid. That’s because they wanted to capture the city.
2 Chronicles,32,19,They were comparing the God of Jerusalem to the gods of the other nations of the world. But those gods were only statues. They had been made by human hands.
2 Chronicles,32,20,King Hezekiah cried out in prayer to God in heaven. He prayed about the problem Jerusalem was facing. So did Isaiah the prophet. He was the son of Amoz.
2 Chronicles,32,21,"The Lord sent an angel. The angel wiped out all the enemy’s fighting men, commanders and officers. He put an end to them right there in the camp of the Assyrian king. So Sennacherib went back to his own land in shame. He went into the temple of his god. There some of his own sons, the people closest to him, killed him with their swords."
2 Chronicles,32,22,"So the Lord saved Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem. He saved them from the power of Sennacherib, the king of Assyria. He also saved them from all their other enemies. He took care of them on every side."
2 Chronicles,32,23,"Many people brought offerings to Jerusalem for the Lord . They brought expensive gifts for Hezekiah, the king of Judah. From then on, all the nations thought well of him."
2 Chronicles,32,24,In those days Hezekiah became sick. He knew he was about to die. So he prayed to the Lord . And the Lord answered him. He gave him a miraculous sign.
2 Chronicles,32,25,But Hezekiah’s heart was proud. He didn’t give thanks for the many kind things the Lord had done for him. So the Lord became angry with him. He also became angry with Judah and Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,32,26,Then Hezekiah had a change of heart. He was sorry he had been proud. The people of Jerusalem were also sorry they had sinned. So the Lord wasn’t angry with them as long as Hezekiah was king.
2 Chronicles,32,27,"Hezekiah was very rich. He received great honor. He made storerooms for his silver and gold. He also made them for his jewels, spices, shields and all kinds of expensive things."
2 Chronicles,32,28,"He made buildings to store the harvest of grain, fresh wine and olive oil. He made barns for all kinds of cattle. He made sheep pens for his flocks."
2 Chronicles,32,29,He built villages. He gained large numbers of flocks and herds. God had made him very rich.
2 Chronicles,32,30,Hezekiah blocked up the upper opening of the Gihon spring. He directed the water to flow down to the west side of the City of David. He had success in everything he did.
2 Chronicles,32,31,The rulers of Babylon sent messengers to him. They asked him about the miraculous sign that had taken place in the land. Then God left Hezekiah to test him. God wanted to know everything in Hezekiah’s heart.
2 Chronicles,32,32,"Hezekiah did many things that showed he was faithful to the Lord . Those things and the other events of his rule are written down. They are written in the record of the vision of the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz. That record is part of the records of the kings of Judah and Israel."
2 Chronicles,32,33,Hezekiah joined the members of his family who had already died. He was buried on the hill where the tombs of David’s family are. The whole nation of Judah honored him when he died. So did the people of Jerusalem. Hezekiah’s son Manasseh became the next king after him.
2 Chronicles,33,1,Manasseh was 12 years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for 55 years.
2 Chronicles,33,2,Manasseh did what was evil in the eyes of the Lord . He followed the practices of the nations. The Lord hated those practices. The Lord had driven out those nations to make room for the Israelites.
2 Chronicles,33,3,Manasseh rebuilt the high places. His father Hezekiah had destroyed them. Manasseh also set up altars to the gods that were named Baal. He made poles used to worship the female god named Asherah. He even bowed down to all the stars and worshiped them.
2 Chronicles,33,4,"He built altars in the Lord ’s temple. The Lord had said about his temple, “My Name will remain in Jerusalem forever.”"
2 Chronicles,33,5,In the two courtyards of the Lord ’s temple Manasseh built altars to honor all the stars in the sky.
2 Chronicles,33,6,He sacrificed his children in the fire to other gods. He did it in the Valley of Ben Hinnom. He practiced all kinds of evil magic. He took part in worshiping evil powers. He got messages from people who had died. He talked to the spirits of people who have died. He did many things that were evil in the eyes of the Lord . Manasseh made the Lord very angry.
2 Chronicles,33,7,"Manasseh had carved a statue of a god. He put it in God’s temple. God had spoken to David and his son Solomon about the temple. He had said, “My Name will be in this temple and in Jerusalem forever. Out of all the cities in the tribes of Israel I have chosen Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,33,8,"I gave this land to your people who lived long ago. I will not make the Israelites leave it again. But they must be careful to do everything I commanded them. They must follow all the laws, directions, and rules I gave them through Moses.”"
2 Chronicles,33,9,But Manasseh led Judah and the people of Jerusalem astray. They did more evil things than the nations the Lord had destroyed to make room for the Israelites.
2 Chronicles,33,10,The Lord spoke to Manasseh and his people. But they didn’t pay any attention to him.
2 Chronicles,33,11,So the Lord brought the army commanders of the king of Assyria against them. They took Manasseh as a prisoner. They put a hook in his nose. They put him in bronze chains. And they took him to Babylon.
2 Chronicles,33,12,"When Manasseh was in trouble, he asked the Lord his God to help him. He made himself very humble in the sight of the God of his people."
2 Chronicles,33,13,"Manasseh prayed to him. When he did, the Lord felt sorry for him. He answered his prayer. The Lord brought Manasseh back to Jerusalem and his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the Lord is God."
2 Chronicles,33,14,"After that, Manasseh rebuilt the outer wall of the City of David. It was west of the Gihon spring in the valley. It reached all the way to the entrance of the Fish Gate. It went around the entire hill of Ophel. Manasseh also made the wall much higher. He stationed military commanders in all the cities in Judah that had high walls around them."
2 Chronicles,33,15,Manasseh got rid of the false gods. He removed the statue of one of those gods from the Lord ’s temple. He also removed all the altars he had built on the temple hill and in Jerusalem. He threw them out of the city.
2 Chronicles,33,16,"Then he made the Lord ’s altar look like new again. He sacrificed friendship offerings and thank offerings on it. He told the people of Judah to serve the Lord , the God of Israel."
2 Chronicles,33,17,The people continued to offer sacrifices at the high places. But they offered them only to the Lord their God.
2 Chronicles,33,18,"The other events of Manasseh’s rule are written down in the official records of the kings of Judah. These records include his prayer to his God. They also include the words the prophets spoke to him in the name of the Lord , the God of Israel."
2 Chronicles,33,19,Everything about Manasseh is written in the records of the prophets. That includes his prayer and the fact that God felt sorry for him. It includes everything he did before he made himself humble in the Lord ’s sight. It includes all his sins and the fact that he wasn’t faithful to the Lord . It includes the locations where he built high places. It includes the places where he set up poles used to worship the female god named Asherah. And it includes the places where he set up statues of other gods.
2 Chronicles,33,20,Manasseh joined the members of his family who had already died. He was buried in his palace. Manasseh’s son Amon became the next king after him.
2 Chronicles,33,21,Amon was 22 years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for two years.
2 Chronicles,33,22,"Amon did what was evil in the eyes of the Lord , just as his father Manasseh had done. Amon worshiped and offered sacrifices to all the statues of gods that Manasseh had made."
2 Chronicles,33,23,He didn’t make himself humble in the Lord ’s sight as his father Manasseh had done. So Amon became even more guilty.
2 Chronicles,33,24,Amon’s officials made plans against him. They murdered him in his palace.
2 Chronicles,33,25,Then the people of the land killed all those who had made plans against King Amon. They made his son Josiah king in his place.
2 Chronicles,34,1,Josiah was eight years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for 31 years.
2 Chronicles,34,2,He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord . He lived the way King David had lived. He didn’t turn away from it to the right or the left.
2 Chronicles,34,3,"While he was still young, he began to worship the God of King David. It was the eighth year of Josiah’s rule. In his 12th year Josiah began to get rid of the high places in Judah and Jerusalem. He removed the poles used to worship the female god named Asherah. He also removed the statues of other false gods."
2 Chronicles,34,4,He ordered the altars of the gods that were named Baal to be torn down. Josiah cut to pieces the altars above them that were used for burning incense. He smashed the Asherah poles. He also smashed the statues of other false gods. Josiah broke all of them to pieces. He scattered the pieces over the graves of those who had offered sacrifices to those gods.
2 Chronicles,34,5,He burned the bones of the priests on their altars. That’s the way he made Judah and Jerusalem pure and “clean.”
2 Chronicles,34,6,"Josiah went to the towns of Manasseh, Ephraim and Simeon. He went all the way to Naphtali. He also went to the destroyed places around all those towns."
2 Chronicles,34,7,Everywhere Josiah went he tore down the altars and the Asherah poles. He crushed the statues of gods to powder. He cut to pieces all the altars for burning incense. He destroyed all those things everywhere in Israel. Then he went back to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,34,8,"In the 18th year of Josiah’s rule, he decided to make the land and temple pure and “clean.” So he sent Shaphan, Maaseiah and Joah to repair the temple of the Lord his God. Shaphan was the son of Azaliah. Maaseiah was ruler of the city. And Joah, the son of Joahaz, kept the records."
2 Chronicles,34,9,These men went to Hilkiah the high priest. They gave him the money that had been brought into God’s temple. The Levites who guarded the gates had collected it. They had received some of the money from the people of Manasseh and Ephraim. They had also received some from the other people who remained in Israel. The rest of the money came from other people. It came from all the people of Judah and Benjamin and the people living in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,34,10,Men were appointed to direct the work on the Lord ’s temple. All the money collected was given to them. These men paid the workers who repaired the temple. They made it look like new again.
2 Chronicles,34,11,They also gave money to the builders and those who worked with wood. The workers used it to buy lumber and blocks of stone. The lumber was used for the supports and beams for the buildings. The kings of Judah had let the buildings fall down.
2 Chronicles,34,12,The workers were faithful in doing the work. Jahath and Obadiah directed them. They were Levites from the family line of Merari. Zechariah and Meshullam also directed them. They were from the family line of Kohath. The Levites were skilled in playing musical instruments.
2 Chronicles,34,13,They were in charge of the laborers. They directed all the workers from job to job. Some of the Levites were secretaries and writers. Other Levites guarded the gates.
2 Chronicles,34,14,The money that had been taken into the Lord ’s temple was being brought out. At that time Hilkiah the priest found the Book of the Law of the Lord . It had been given through Moses.
2 Chronicles,34,15,"Hilkiah spoke to Shaphan the secretary. Hilkiah said, “I’ve found the Book of the Law in the Lord ’s temple.” Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan."
2 Chronicles,34,16,"Then Shaphan took the book to King Josiah. He told him, “Your officials are doing everything they’ve been asked to do."
2 Chronicles,34,17,They have paid out the money that was in the Lord ’s temple. They’ve put it in the care of the directors and workers.”
2 Chronicles,34,18,"Shaphan continued, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.” Shaphan read some of it to the king."
2 Chronicles,34,19,"The king heard the words of the Law. When he did, he tore his royal robes."
2 Chronicles,34,20,"He gave orders to Hilkiah, Ahikam, Abdon, Shaphan the secretary and Asaiah. Ahikam was the son of Shaphan. Abdon was the son of Micah. And Asaiah was the king’s attendant. Josiah commanded them,"
2 Chronicles,34,21,“Go. Ask the Lord for advice. Ask him about what is written in this book that has been found. Do it for me. Also do it for the people who remain in Israel and Judah. The Lord has been very angry with us. That’s because our people before us didn’t obey what the Lord had said. They didn’t do everything written in this book.”
2 Chronicles,34,22,Hilkiah and the people the king had sent with him went to speak to Huldah the prophet. She was the wife of Shallum. Shallum was the son of Tokhath. Tokhath was the son of Hasrah. Shallum took care of the sacred robes. Huldah lived in the New Quarter of Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,34,23,"Huldah said to them, “The Lord is the God of Israel. He says, ‘Here is what you should tell the man who sent you to me."
2 Chronicles,34,24,"“The Lord says, ‘I am going to bring horrible trouble on this place and its people. There are curses written down in the book that has been read to the king of Judah. All those curses will take place."
2 Chronicles,34,25,That’s because the people have deserted me. They have burned incense to other gods. They have made me very angry because of everything their hands have made. So my anger will burn like a fire against this place. And the fire of my anger will not be put out.’ ” ’
2 Chronicles,34,26,"The king of Judah sent you to ask for advice. Tell him, ‘The Lord is the God of Israel. He has a message for you about the things you heard."
2 Chronicles,34,27,"The Lord says, “Your heart was tender. You made yourself humble in my sight. You heard what I spoke against this place and its people. So you made yourself humble. You tore your royal robes and wept. And I have heard you,” announces the Lord."
2 Chronicles,34,28,You will join the members of your family who have already died. You will be buried in peace. You will not see all the trouble I am going to bring. I am going to bring trouble on this place and the people who live here.’ ” Huldah’s answer was taken back to the king.
2 Chronicles,34,29,Then the king called together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,34,30,"He went up to the Lord ’s temple. The people of Judah and Jerusalem went with him. So did the priests and Levites. All of them went, from the least important of them to the most important. The king had all the words of the Book of the Covenant read to them. The book had been found in the Lord ’s temple."
2 Chronicles,34,31,"The king stood next to his pillar. He agreed to the terms of the covenant in front of the Lord . The king promised to serve the Lord and obey his commands, directions and rules. He promised to obey them with all his heart and with all his soul. So the king promised to obey the terms of the covenant that were written in that book."
2 Chronicles,34,32,Then he had everyone in Jerusalem and in Benjamin commit themselves to the covenant. The people of Jerusalem did it in keeping with the covenant of the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles,34,33,"Josiah removed all the statues of false gods from the whole territory that belonged to the Israelites. The Lord hated those statues. Josiah had everyone in Israel serve the Lord their God. As long as he lived, they didn’t fail to follow the Lord , the God of their people."
2 Chronicles,35,1,Josiah celebrated the Passover Feast in Jerusalem to honor the Lord . The Passover lamb was killed on the 14th day of the first month.
2 Chronicles,35,2,Josiah appointed the priests to their duties. He cheered them up as they served the Lord at his temple.
2 Chronicles,35,3,"The Levites taught all the people of Israel. The Levites had been set apart to the Lord . Josiah said to them, “Put the sacred ark of the covenant in the temple Solomon built. He was the son of David and king of Israel. The ark must not be carried around on your shoulders. Serve the Lord your God. Serve his people Israel."
2 Chronicles,35,4,"Prepare yourselves by families in your groups. Do it based on the directions written by David, the king of Israel, and by his son Solomon."
2 Chronicles,35,5,“Stand at the temple. Stand there with a group of Levites for each group of families among your people.
2 Chronicles,35,6,Kill the Passover lambs. Set yourselves apart to the Lord . Prepare the lambs for your people. Do what the Lord commanded through Moses.”
2 Chronicles,35,7,"Josiah provided animals for the Passover offerings. He gave them for all the people who were there. He gave a total of 30,000 lambs and goats and 3,000 oxen. He gave all of them from his own possessions."
2 Chronicles,35,8,"His officials also gave freely. They gave to the people and the priests and Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah and Jehiel were in charge of God’s temple. They gave the priests 2,600 Passover lambs and 300 oxen."
2 Chronicles,35,9,"Konaniah and his brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel also gave offerings. So did Hashabiah, Jeiel and Jozabad. All of them were the leaders of the Levites. They gave 5,000 Passover lambs and 500 oxen for the Levites."
2 Chronicles,35,10,The Passover service was arranged. The priests stood in their places. The Levites were in their groups. That’s what the king had ordered.
2 Chronicles,35,11,The Passover lambs were killed. The priests splashed against the altar the blood handed to them. The Levites skinned the animals.
2 Chronicles,35,12,They set the burnt offerings to one side. These offerings were for the smaller family groups to offer to the Lord . That’s what was written in the Book of Moses. The Levites did the same thing with the oxen.
2 Chronicles,35,13,"They cooked the Passover animals over the fire, just as the law required. They boiled the holy offerings in pots, large kettles and pans. They served the offerings quickly to all the people."
2 Chronicles,35,14,"After that, they got things ready for themselves and the priests. That’s because the priests, who were from the family line of Aaron, were busy until dark. They were sacrificing the burnt offerings and the fat parts. The Levites got things ready for themselves and for the priests, who belonged to Aaron’s family line."
2 Chronicles,35,15,"Those who played music were from the family line of Asaph. They were in the places that had been set up by David, Asaph, Heman and Jeduthun. Jeduthun had been the king’s prophet. The guards at each gate didn’t have to leave their places. That’s because their brother Levites got things ready for them."
2 Chronicles,35,16,So at that time the entire service to honor the Lord was carried out. The Passover Feast was celebrated. The burnt offerings were sacrificed on the Lord ’s altar. That’s what King Josiah had ordered.
2 Chronicles,35,17,The Israelites who were there celebrated the Passover Feast at that time. They observed the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days.
2 Chronicles,35,18,The Passover Feast hadn’t been observed like that in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet. None of the kings of Israel had ever celebrated a Passover Feast like Josiah’s. He celebrated it with the priests and Levites. All the people of Judah and Israel were there along with the people of Jerusalem. He celebrated it with them too.
2 Chronicles,35,19,That Passover Feast was celebrated in the 18th year of Josiah’s rule.
2 Chronicles,35,20,"Josiah had put the temple in order. After all of that, Necho went up to fight at Carchemish. He was king of Egypt. Carchemish was on the Euphrates River. Josiah marched out to meet Necho in battle."
2 Chronicles,35,21,"But Necho sent messengers to him. They said, “Josiah king of Judah, there isn’t any trouble between you and me. I’m not attacking you at this time. I’m at war with another country. God told me to hurry. He’s with me. So stop opposing him. If you don’t, he’ll destroy you.”"
2 Chronicles,35,22,"But Josiah wouldn’t turn away from Necho. Josiah wore different clothes so people wouldn’t recognize him. He wanted to go to war against Necho. He wouldn’t listen to what God had commanded Necho to say. Instead, Josiah went out to fight him on the plains of Megiddo."
2 Chronicles,35,23,"Men who had bows shot arrows at King Josiah. After he was hit, he told his officers, “Take me away. I’m badly wounded.”"
2 Chronicles,35,24,So they took him out of his chariot. They put him in his other chariot. They brought him to Jerusalem. There he died. He was buried in the tombs of his family. All the people of Judah and Jerusalem mourned for him.
2 Chronicles,35,25,Jeremiah wrote songs of sadness about Josiah. To this day all the male and female singers remember Josiah by singing those songs. That became a practice in Israel. The songs are written down in the Book of the Songs of Sadness.
2 Chronicles,35,26,Josiah did many things that showed he was faithful to the Lord . Those things and the other events of Josiah’s rule were in keeping with what is written in the Law of the Lord.
2 Chronicles,35,27,All the events from beginning to end are written down. They are written in the records of the kings of Israel and Judah.
2 Chronicles,36,1,The people of the land went and got Jehoahaz. He was the son of Josiah. The people made Jehoahaz king in Jerusalem in place of his father.
2 Chronicles,36,2,Jehoahaz was 23 years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for three months.
2 Chronicles,36,3,The king of Egypt removed him from his throne in Jerusalem. The king of Egypt made the people of Judah pay him a huge tax. The tax was almost four tons of silver and 75 pounds of gold.
2 Chronicles,36,4,"Necho, the king of Egypt, made Eliakim king over Judah and Jerusalem. Eliakim was a brother of Jehoahaz. Necho changed Eliakim’s name to Jehoiakim. But Necho took Eliakim’s brother Jehoahaz with him to Egypt."
2 Chronicles,36,5,Jehoiakim was 25 years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for 11 years. He did what was evil in the eyes of the Lord his God.
2 Chronicles,36,6,Nebuchadnezzar attacked him. Nebuchadnezzar was king of Babylon. He put Jehoiakim in bronze chains. And he took him to Babylon.
2 Chronicles,36,7,Nebuchadnezzar also took to Babylon objects from the Lord ’s temple. He put them in his own temple there.
2 Chronicles,36,8,The other events of Jehoiakim’s rule are written in the records of the kings of Israel and Judah. He did things the Lord hated. Those things and everything that happened to him are also written in those records. Jehoiakim’s son Jehoiachin became the next king after him.
2 Chronicles,36,9,Jehoiachin was 18 years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for three months and ten days. He did what was evil in the eyes of the Lord.
2 Chronicles,36,10,"In the spring, King Nebuchadnezzar sent for him. He brought him to Babylon. He also brought things of value from the Lord ’s temple. He made Zedekiah king over Judah and Jerusalem. Zedekiah was Jehoiachin’s uncle."
2 Chronicles,36,11,Zedekiah was 21 years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for 11 years.
2 Chronicles,36,12,He did what was evil in the eyes of the Lord his God. He didn’t pay any attention to the message the Lord spoke through Jeremiah the prophet.
2 Chronicles,36,13,"Zedekiah also refused to remain under the control of King Nebuchadnezzar. The king had forced Zedekiah to make a promise in God’s name. But Zedekiah’s heart became very stubborn. He wouldn’t turn to the Lord , the God of Israel."
2 Chronicles,36,14,And that’s not all. The people and all the leaders of the priests became more and more unfaithful. They followed all the practices of the nations. The Lord hated those practices. The people and leaders made the Lord ’s temple “unclean.” The Lord had set the temple in Jerusalem apart in a special way for himself.
2 Chronicles,36,15,"The Lord , the God of Israel, sent word to his people through his messengers. He sent it to them again and again. He took pity on his people. He also took pity on the temple where he lived."
2 Chronicles,36,16,But God’s people made fun of his messengers. They hated his words. They laughed at his prophets. Finally the Lord ’s great anger was stirred up against his people. Nothing could save them.
2 Chronicles,36,17,The Lord brought the king of the Babylonians against them. The Babylonian army killed their young people with their swords at the temple. They didn’t spare young men or young women. They didn’t spare the old people or weak people either. God handed all of them over to Nebuchadnezzar.
2 Chronicles,36,18,Nebuchadnezzar carried off to Babylon all the objects from God’s temple. Some of those things were large. Others were small. He carried off the treasures of the temple. He also carried off the treasures that belonged to the king and his officials.
2 Chronicles,36,19,The Babylonians set God’s temple on fire. They broke down the wall of Jerusalem. They burned all the palaces. They destroyed everything of value there.
2 Chronicles,36,20,Nebuchadnezzar took the rest of the people to Babylon as prisoners. They had escaped from being killed by swords. They served him and those who ruled after him. That lasted until the kingdom of Persia came to power.
2 Chronicles,36,21,The land of Israel enjoyed its sabbath years. It rested. That deserted land wasn’t farmed for a full 70 years. What the Lord had spoken through Jeremiah came true.
2 Chronicles,36,22,"It was the first year of the rule of Cyrus. He was king of Persia. The Lord inspired him to send a message all through his kingdom. It happened so that what the Lord had spoken through Jeremiah would come true. The message was written down. It said,"
2 Chronicles,36,23,"“Cyrus, the king of Persia, says, “ ‘The Lord is the God of heaven. He has given me all the kingdoms on earth. He has appointed me to build a temple for him at Jerusalem in Judah. Any of his people among you may go up to Jerusalem. And may the Lord their God be with them.’ ”"
