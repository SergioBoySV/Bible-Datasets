Judges,1,1,"Joshua died. After that, the Israelites spoke to the Lord . They asked him, “Who of us will go up first and fight against the Canaanites?”"
Judges,1,2,"The Lord answered, “The tribe of Judah will go up. I have handed the land over to them.”"
Judges,1,3,"Then the men of Judah spoke to their fellow Israelites, the men of Simeon. They said, “Come up with us. Come into the territory Joshua gave us. Help us fight against the Canaanites. Then we’ll go with you into your territory.” So the men of Simeon went with them."
Judges,1,4,"When the men of Judah attacked, the Lord helped them. He handed the Canaanites and Perizzites over to them. They struck down 10,000 men at Bezek."
Judges,1,5,The men of Judah found Adoni-Bezek there. They fought against him. They struck down the Canaanites and Perizzites.
Judges,1,6,But Adoni-Bezek ran away. The men of Judah chased him and caught him. Then they cut off his thumbs and big toes.
Judges,1,7,"Adoni-Bezek said, “I cut off the thumbs and big toes of 70 kings. I made them pick up scraps under my table. Now God has paid me back for what I did to them.” The men of Judah brought Adoni-Bezek to Jerusalem. That’s where he died."
Judges,1,8,The men of Judah attacked Jerusalem and captured it. They set the city on fire. They killed its people with their swords.
Judges,1,9,"After that, the men of Judah went down to fight against some Canaanites. Those Canaanites were living in the central hill country. They also fought against those living in the Negev Desert and the western hills."
Judges,1,10,"Then the men of Judah marched out against the Canaanites living in Hebron. Hebron used to be called Kiriath Arba. The men of Judah won the battle over Sheshai, Ahiman and Talmai."
Judges,1,11,From Hebron they marched out against the people living in Debir. It used to be called Kiriath Sepher.
Judges,1,12,"Caleb said, “I will give my daughter Aksah to be married. I’ll give her to the man who attacks and captures Kiriath Sepher.”"
Judges,1,13,Othniel captured it. So Caleb gave his daughter Aksah to him to be his wife. Othniel was the son of Kenaz. He was Caleb’s younger brother.
Judges,1,14,"One day Aksah came to Othniel. She begged him to ask her father for a field. When she got off her donkey, Caleb asked her, “What can I do for you?”"
Judges,1,15,"She replied, “Do me a special favor. You have given me some land in the Negev Desert. Give me springs of water also.” So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs."
Judges,1,16,Moses’ father-in-law was a Kenite. His family went up from Jericho. Jericho was also known as the City of Palm Trees. His family went up with the people of Judah to the Desert of Judah. They went there to live among its people. Those people were living in the Negev Desert near Arad.
Judges,1,17,"The men of Judah marched out with their fellow Israelites, the men of Simeon. They attacked the people of Canaan living in Zephath. They set the city apart to the Lord in a special way to be destroyed. That’s why the city was called Hormah."
Judges,1,18,"The men of Judah captured Gaza, Ashkelon and Ekron. They also captured the territory around each of those cities."
Judges,1,19,The Lord was with the men of Judah. They took over the central hill country. But they weren’t able to drive the people out of the plains. That’s because those people used chariots that had some iron parts.
Judges,1,20,Moses had promised to give Hebron to Caleb. So Hebron was given to Caleb. He drove the three sons of Anak out of it.
Judges,1,21,But the people of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites living in Jerusalem. So to this day they live there with the people of Benjamin.
Judges,1,22,The tribes of Joseph attacked Bethel. The Lord was with them.
Judges,1,23,They sent men to Bethel to check it out. It used to be called Luz.
Judges,1,24,"Those who were sent saw a man coming out of the city. They said to him, “Show us how to get into the city. If you do, we’ll see that you are treated well.”"
Judges,1,25,So he showed them how to get in. The men of Joseph killed the people in the city with their swords. But they spared the man from Bethel. They also spared his whole family.
Judges,1,26,Then he went to the land of the Hittites. He built a city there. He called it Luz. That’s still its name to this day.
Judges,1,27,"But the tribe of Manasseh didn’t drive out the people of Beth Shan. They didn’t drive out the people of Taanach, Dor, Ibleam and Megiddo. And they didn’t drive out the people of the settlements that are around those cities either. That’s because the Canaanites had made up their minds to continue living in that land."
Judges,1,28,"Later, Israel became stronger. Then they forced the Canaanites to work hard for them. But Israel never drove them out completely."
Judges,1,29,The tribe of Ephraim didn’t drive out the Canaanites living in Gezer. So the Canaanites continued to live there among them.
Judges,1,30,The tribe of Zebulun didn’t drive out the Canaanites living in Kitron and Nahalol. So these Canaanites lived among them. But the people of Zebulun forced the Canaanites to work hard for them.
Judges,1,31,"The tribe of Asher didn’t drive out the people living in Akko and Sidon. They didn’t drive out the people of Ahlab, Akzib, Helbah, Aphek and Rehob."
Judges,1,32,So the people of Asher lived among the Canaanites who were in the land.
Judges,1,33,The tribe of Naphtali didn’t drive out the people living in Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath. So the people of Naphtali lived among the Canaanites who were in the land. The people of Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath were forced to work hard for them.
Judges,1,34,The Amorites made the people of Dan stay in the central hill country. They didn’t let them come down into the plain.
Judges,1,35,The Amorites made up their minds to stay in Mount Heres. They also stayed in Aijalon and Shaalbim. But the power of the tribes of Joseph grew. Then the Amorites were forced to work hard for them.
Judges,1,36,The border of the Amorites started at Scorpion Pass. It went to Sela and even past it.
Judges,2,1,"The angel of the Lord went up from Gilgal to Bokim. There he said to the Israelites, “I brought you up out of Egypt. I led you into this land. It is the land I promised to give to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. At that time I said, ‘I will never break the covenant I made with you."
Judges,2,2,"So you must not make a covenant with the people of this land. Instead, you must tear down their altars.’ But you have disobeyed me. Why did you do it?"
Judges,2,3,"I have said something else. I said, ‘I will not drive out those people to make room for you. They and their gods will become traps for you.’ ”"
Judges,2,4,The angel of the Lord spoke these things to all the Israelites. Then the people wept out loud.
Judges,2,5,So that place was called Bokim. The people offered sacrifices there to the Lord.
Judges,2,6,Joshua sent the Israelites away. Then they went to take over the land. All of them went to their own shares of land.
Judges,2,7,The people served the Lord as long as Joshua lived. They also served him as long as the elders lived. Those were the elders who lived longer than Joshua did. They had seen all the great things the Lord had done for Israel.
Judges,2,8,"Joshua, the servant of the Lord , died. He was the son of Nun. He was 110 years old when he died."
Judges,2,9,His people buried him on his own property at Timnath Heres. It’s north of Mount Gaash in the hill country of Ephraim.
Judges,2,10,All the people of Joshua’s time joined the members of their families who had already died. Then those who were born after them grew up. They didn’t know the Lord and what he had done for Israel.
Judges,2,11,The Israelites did what was evil in the sight of the Lord . They served gods that were named Baal.
Judges,2,12,"They deserted the Lord , the God of their people. He had brought them out of Egypt. But now the Israelites served other gods and worshiped them. They served the gods of the nations that were around them. They made the Lord angry"
Judges,2,13,because they deserted him. They served Baal. They also served female gods that were named Ashtoreth.
Judges,2,14,The Lord became angry with the Israelites. So he handed them over to robbers. The robbers stole everything from them. The Lord handed the Israelites over to their enemies all around them. Israel wasn’t able to fight against them anymore and win.
Judges,2,15,"When the Israelites went out to fight, the Lord ’s power was against them. He let their enemies win the battle over them. The Lord had warned them that it would happen. And now they were suffering terribly."
Judges,2,16,Then the Lord gave them leaders. The leaders saved them from the power of those robbers.
Judges,2,17,But the people wouldn’t listen to their leaders. They weren’t faithful to the Lord . They served other gods and worshiped them. They didn’t obey the Lord ’s commands as their people before them had done. They quickly turned away from the path their people had taken.
Judges,2,18,"When the Lord gave them a leader, he was with that leader. The Lord saved the people from the power of their enemies. He did it as long as the leader lived. The Lord felt very sorry for the people. They groaned because of what their enemies did to them. Their enemies treated them badly."
Judges,2,19,"But when the leader died, the people returned to their evil ways. The things they did were even more sinful than the things their people before them had done. They served other gods and worshiped them. They refused to give up their evil practices. They wouldn’t change their stubborn ways."
Judges,2,20,"So the Lord became very angry with the Israelites. He said, “This nation has broken my covenant. I made it with their people of long ago. But this nation has not listened to me."
Judges,2,21,Joshua left some nations in the land when he died. I will no longer drive out those nations to make room for Israel.
Judges,2,22,"I will use those nations to test Israel. I will see whether Israel will live the way I, the Lord , want them to. I will see whether they will be like their people of long ago. I will see whether they will follow my path.”"
Judges,2,23,The Lord had let those nations remain in the land. He didn’t drive them out right away. He didn’t hand them over to Joshua.
Judges,3,1,The Lord left some nations in the land. He left them to test the Israelites who hadn’t lived through any of the wars in Canaan.
Judges,3,2,He wanted to teach the men in Israel who had never been in battle before. He wanted them to learn how to fight.
Judges,3,3,So he left the five rulers of the Philistines. He left the people of Canaan and the people of Sidon. He left the Hivites living in the Lebanon mountains. They lived in the area between Mount Baal Hermon and Lebo Hamath.
Judges,3,4,The Lord left those nations where they were to test the Israelites. He wanted to see whether they would obey his commands. He had given those commands through Moses to their people of long ago.
Judges,3,5,"So the Israelites lived among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites."
Judges,3,6,They married the daughters of those people. They gave their own daughters to the sons of those people. And they served the gods of those people.
Judges,3,7,The Israelites did what was evil in the sight of the Lord . They forgot the Lord their God. They served gods that were named Baal. They also served female gods that were named Asherah.
Judges,3,8,"So the Lord was very angry with Israel. He handed them over to the power of Cushan-Rishathaim, the king of Aram Naharaim. For eight years Israel was under his rule."
Judges,3,9,"They cried out to the Lord . Then he provided someone to save them. The man’s name was Othniel, the son of Kenaz. He was Caleb’s younger brother."
Judges,3,10,"The Spirit of the Lord came on Othniel. So he became Israel’s leader. He went to war. The Lord handed over to him Cushan-Rishathaim, the king of Aram. Othniel won the battle over him."
Judges,3,11,"So the land was at peace for 40 years. Then Othniel, the son of Kenaz, died."
Judges,3,12,Again the Israelites did what was evil in the sight of the Lord . So the Lord gave Eglon power over Israel. Eglon was the king of Moab.
Judges,3,13,He got the Ammonites and Amalekites to join him. All of them came and attacked Israel. They captured Jericho. Jericho was also known as The City of Palm Trees.
Judges,3,14,"For 18 years the Israelites were under the rule of Eglon, the king of Moab."
Judges,3,15,"Again the Israelites cried out to the Lord . Then he provided someone to save them. The man’s name was Ehud, the son of Gera. Ehud was left-handed. He was from the tribe of Benjamin. The Israelites sent Ehud to Eglon, the king of Moab. They sent him to give the king what he required them to bring him."
Judges,3,16,Ehud had made a sword that had two edges. It was about a foot and a half long. He tied it to his right leg under his clothes.
Judges,3,17,"Eglon, the king of Moab, was a very fat man. Ehud gave him the gift he had brought."
Judges,3,18,"After that, Ehud sent away those who had carried it."
Judges,3,19,"When he came to the place where some statues of gods stood near Gilgal, Ehud went back to Eglon. He said, “Your Majesty, I have a secret message for you.” The king said to his attendants, “Leave us!” And all his attendants left him."
Judges,3,20,"Then Ehud approached him. King Eglon was sitting alone in the upstairs room of his palace. Ehud said, “I have a message from God for you.” So the king got up from his seat."
Judges,3,21,Then Ehud reached out his left hand. He pulled out the sword tied to his right leg. He stuck it into the king’s stomach.
Judges,3,22,Even the handle sank in after the blade. Eglon sagged and fell to the floor. Ehud didn’t pull out the sword. And the fat closed over it.
Judges,3,23,Ehud went out to the porch. He shut the doors of the upstairs room behind him. Then he locked them.
Judges,3,24,"After he had gone, the servants came. They found the doors of the upstairs room locked. They said, “Eglon must be going to the toilet in the inside room of the palace.”"
Judges,3,25,They waited for a long time. They waited so long they became worried. But the king still didn’t open the doors of the room. So they took a key and unlocked them. There they saw their king. He had fallen to the floor and was dead.
Judges,3,26,"While Eglon’s servants had been waiting, Ehud had gotten away. He passed by the statues of gods and escaped to Seirah."
Judges,3,27,There in the hill country of Ephraim he blew a trumpet. Then he led the Israelites down from the hills.
Judges,3,28,"“Follow me,” Ehud ordered. “The Lord has handed your enemy Moab over to you.” So they followed him down. They took over the only places where people could go across the Jordan River to get to Moab. They didn’t let anyone go across."
Judges,3,29,"At that time they struck down about 10,000 men of Moab. All those men were strong and powerful. But not even one escaped."
Judges,3,30,That day Moab was brought under the rule of Israel. So the land was at peace for 80 years.
Judges,3,31,"After Ehud, Shamgar became the next leader. He was the son of Anath. Shamgar struck down 600 Philistines with a large, pointed stick used to drive oxen. He too saved Israel."
Judges,4,1,"After Ehud died, the Israelites once again did what was evil in the sight of the Lord."
Judges,4,2,So the Lord handed them over to the power of Jabin. He was a king in Canaan. He ruled in Hazor. The commander of his army was Sisera. He lived in Harosheth Haggoyim.
Judges,4,3,Jabin used 900 chariots that had some iron parts. He treated the Israelites very badly for 20 years. So they cried out to the Lord for help.
Judges,4,4,Deborah was a prophet. She was the wife of Lappidoth. She was leading Israel at that time.
Judges,4,5,Under the Palm Tree of Deborah she served the people as their judge. That place was between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim. The Israelites went up to her there. They came to have her decide cases for them. She settled matters between them.
Judges,4,6,"Deborah sent for Barak. He was the son of Abinoam. Barak was from Kedesh in the land of Naphtali. Deborah said to Barak, “The Lord , the God of Israel, is giving you a command. He says, ‘Go! Take 10,000 men from the tribes of Naphtali and Zebulun with you. Then lead them up to Mount Tabor."
Judges,4,7,"I will lead Sisera into a trap. He is the commander of Jabin’s army. I will bring him, his chariots and his troops to the Kishon River. There I will hand him over to you.’ ”"
Judges,4,8,"Barak said to her, “If you go with me, I’ll go. But if you don’t go with me, I won’t go.”"
Judges,4,9,"“All right,” Deborah said. “I’ll go with you. But because of the way you are doing this, you won’t receive any honor. Instead, the Lord will hand Sisera over to a woman.” So Deborah went to Kedesh with Barak."
Judges,4,10,"There he sent for men from Zebulun and Naphtali. And 10,000 men followed him into battle. Deborah also went with him."
Judges,4,11,"Heber, the Kenite, had left the other Kenites. They came from the family line of Hobab. He was the brother-in-law of Moses. Heber set up his tent by the large tree in Zaanannim near Kedesh."
Judges,4,12,"Sisera was told that Barak, the son of Abinoam, had gone up to Mount Tabor."
Judges,4,13,So Sisera gathered together his 900 chariots that had some iron parts. He also gathered together all his men. He brought them from Harosheth Haggoyim to the Kishon River.
Judges,4,14,"Then Deborah said to Barak, “Go! Today the Lord will hand Sisera over to you. Hasn’t the Lord gone ahead of you?” So Barak went down Mount Tabor. His 10,000 men followed him."
Judges,4,15,"As Barak’s men marched out, the Lord drove Sisera away from the field of battle. The Lord scattered all of Sisera’s chariots. Barak’s men struck down Sisera’s army with their swords. Sisera got down from his chariot. He ran away on foot."
Judges,4,16,Barak chased Sisera’s chariots and army. Barak chased them all the way to Harosheth Haggoyim. All of Sisera’s troops were killed by swords. Not even one was left.
Judges,4,17,"But Sisera ran away on foot. He ran to the tent of Jael. She was the wife of Heber, the Kenite. Sisera ran there because there was a treaty between Heber’s family and Jabin, the king of Hazor."
Judges,4,18,"Jael went out to meet Sisera. “Come in, sir,” she said. “Come right in. Don’t be afraid.” So he entered her tent. Then she covered him with a blanket."
Judges,4,19,"“I’m thirsty,” he said. “Please give me some water.” So Jael opened a bottle of milk. The bottle was made out of animal skin. She gave him a drink of milk. Then she covered him up again."
Judges,4,20,"“Stand in the doorway of the tent,” he told her. “Someone might come by and ask you, ‘Is anyone in there?’ If that happens, say ‘No.’ ”"
Judges,4,21,"But Heber’s wife Jael picked up a tent stake and a hammer. She went quietly over to Sisera. He was lying there, fast asleep. He was very tired. She drove the stake through his head right into the ground. So he died."
Judges,4,22,"Just then Barak came by because he was chasing Sisera. Jael went out to meet him. “Come right in,” she said. “I’ll show you the man you are looking for.” So he went in with her. Sisera was lying there with the stake through his head. He was dead."
Judges,4,23,On that day God brought Jabin under Israel’s control. He was a king in Canaan.
Judges,4,24,Israel’s power grew stronger and stronger against King Jabin. The Israelites became so strong that they destroyed him.
Judges,5,1,On that day Deborah and Barak sang a song. Barak was the son of Abinoam. Here is what Deborah and Barak sang.
Judges,5,2,"“The princes in Israel lead the way. The people follow them just because they want to. When this happens, praise the Lord!"
Judges,5,3,"“Kings, hear this! Rulers, listen! I will sing to the Lord. I will praise the Lord in song. He is the God of Israel."
Judges,5,4,"“ Lord , you went out from Seir. You marched out from the land of Edom. The earth shook. The heavens poured. The clouds poured down their water."
Judges,5,5,The mountains shook because of the Lord . He was at Mount Sinai. They shook because of the Lord . He is the God of Israel.
Judges,5,6,"“The main roads were deserted. So travelers used the winding paths. That happened in the days of Shamgar, the son of Anath. It happened in the days of Jael."
Judges,5,7,"Those who lived in the villages of Israel would not fight. They held back until I, Deborah, came. I came as a mother in Israel."
Judges,5,8,"War came to the city gates. Then God chose new leaders. But no shields or spears were seen anywhere. There weren’t any among 40,000 men in Israel."
Judges,5,9,My heart is with the princes in Israel. It’s with the people who follow them just because they want to. Praise the Lord!
Judges,5,10,“Some of you ride on white donkeys. Some of you sit on your saddle blankets. Some of you walk along the road. Think about
Judges,5,11,the voices of the singers at the watering places. They sing about the victories of the Lord. They sing about the victories of his people who live in Israel’s villages. “The people of the Lord went down to the city gates.
Judges,5,12,"‘Wake up, Deborah! Wake up!’ they said. ‘Wake up! Wake up! Begin to sing! Barak, get up! Son of Abinoam, capture your prisoners!’"
Judges,5,13,“The nobles who were left came down. The people of the Lord came down to me against the powerful enemy.
Judges,5,14,Some came from the part of Ephraim where some Amalekites lived. Some from Benjamin were with the people who followed Ephraim. Captains came down from Makir. Those who rule like commanders came down from Zebulun.
Judges,5,15,"The princes of Issachar were with Deborah. The men of Issachar were with Barak. They went into the valley under his command. In the territories of Reuben, men looked deeply into their hearts."
Judges,5,16,"Why did they stay among the sheep pens? Why did they stay to hear shepherds whistling for the flocks? In the territories of Reuben, men looked deeply into their hearts."
Judges,5,17,Gilead stayed east of the Jordan River. Why did Dan stay near the ships? The men of Asher remained on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. They stayed in their safe harbors.
Judges,5,18,The people of Zebulun put their very lives in danger. So did Naphtali on the hillside fields.
Judges,5,19,“Kings came and fought. The kings of Canaan fought at Taanach by the streams of Megiddo. But they didn’t carry away any silver. They didn’t take anything at all.
Judges,5,20,From the heavens the stars fought. From the sky they fought against Sisera.
Judges,5,21,"The Kishon River swept them away. The Kishon is a very old river. My spirit, march on! Be strong!"
Judges,5,22,The hooves of the horses pounded like thunder. The powerful horses of our enemies galloped away.
Judges,5,23,"‘Let Meroz be cursed,’ said the angel of the Lord. ‘Let bitter curses fall on its people. They did not come to help the Lord. They did not come to help him against our powerful enemies.’"
Judges,5,24,"“May Jael be the most blessed woman of all. May the wife of Heber, the Kenite, be blessed. May she be the most blessed woman of all those who live in tents."
Judges,5,25,Sisera asked for water. She gave him milk. In a bowl fit for nobles she brought him buttermilk.
Judges,5,26,Her hand reached out for a tent stake. Her right hand reached for a hammer. She hit Sisera. She crushed his head. She drove the stake right through his head.
Judges,5,27,He sank down. He fell at her feet. He was lying there. At her feet he sank down. He fell. He fell where he sank down. That’s where he died.
Judges,5,28,“Sisera’s mother looked out through the window. From behind the wooden screen she cried out. ‘Why is his chariot taking so long to get here?’ she said. ‘Why can’t I hear the noise of his chariots yet?’
Judges,5,29,Her wisest ladies answer her. And here’s what she keeps saying to herself.
Judges,5,30,"She says, ‘They must be finding riches to bring back. They must be dividing them up. Each man is getting a woman or two. They are giving colorful clothes to Sisera. The clothes are very beautiful. He will bring some for me to wear. The men must be finding many things to bring home.’"
Judges,5,31,"“ Lord , may all your enemies be destroyed. But may all who love you be like the morning sun. May they be like the sun when it shines the brightest.” So the land was at peace for 40 years."
Judges,6,1,The Israelites did what was evil in the sight of the Lord . So for seven years he handed them over to the people of Midian.
Judges,6,2,The Midianites treated the Israelites very badly. That’s why they made hiding places for themselves. They hid in holes in the mountains. They also hid in caves and in other safe places.
Judges,6,3,"Each year the people planted their crops. When they did, the Midianites came into the country and attacked it. So did the Amalekites and other tribes from the east."
Judges,6,4,They camped on the land. They destroyed the crops all the way to Gaza. They didn’t spare any living thing for Israel. They didn’t spare sheep or cattle or donkeys.
Judges,6,5,The Midianites came up with their livestock and tents. They came like huge numbers of locusts. It was impossible to count the men and their camels. They came into the land to destroy it.
Judges,6,6,The Midianites made the Israelites very poor. So they cried out to the Lord for help.
Judges,6,7,They cried out to the Lord because of what the Midianites had done.
Judges,6,8,"So he sent a prophet to Israel. The prophet said, “The Lord is the God of Israel. He says, ‘I brought you up out of Egypt. That is the land where you were slaves."
Judges,6,9,I saved you from the power of the Egyptians. I saved you from all those who were treating you badly. I drove out the Canaanites to make room for you. I gave you their land.
Judges,6,10,"I said to you, “I am the Lord your God. You are now living in the land of the Amorites. Do not worship their gods.” But you have not listened to me.’ ”"
Judges,6,11,The angel of the Lord came. He sat down under an oak tree in Ophrah. The tree belonged to Joash. He was from the family line of Abiezer. Gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress at Ophrah. He was the son of Joash. Gideon was threshing in a winepress to hide the wheat from the Midianites.
Judges,6,12,"The angel of the Lord appeared to Gideon. He said, “Mighty warrior, the Lord is with you.”"
Judges,6,13,"“Pardon me, sir,” Gideon replied, “you say the Lord is with us. Then why has all this happened to us? Where are all the wonderful things he has done? Our people of long ago told us about them. They said, ‘Didn’t the Lord bring us up out of Egypt?’ But now the Lord has deserted us. He has handed us over to Midian.”"
Judges,6,14,"The Lord turned to Gideon. He said to him, “You are strong. Go and save Israel from the power of Midian. I am sending you.”"
Judges,6,15,"“Pardon me, sir,” Gideon replied, “but how can I possibly save Israel? My family group is the weakest in the tribe of Manasseh. And I’m the least important member of my family.”"
Judges,6,16,"The Lord answered, “I will be with you. So you will strike down the Midianites. You will leave no one alive.”"
Judges,6,17,"Gideon replied, “If you are pleased with me, give me a special sign. Then I’ll know that it’s really you talking to me."
Judges,6,18,"Please don’t go away until I come back. I’ll bring my offering and set it down in front of you.” The Lord said, “I will wait until you return.”"
Judges,6,19,Gideon went inside and prepared a young goat. From 36 pounds of flour he made bread without using yeast. He put the meat in a basket. In a pot he put soup made from the meat. Then he brought all of it and offered it to the Lord under the oak tree.
Judges,6,20,"The angel of God said to Gideon, “Take the meat and the bread. Place them on this rock. Then pour out the soup.” So Gideon did it."
Judges,6,21,The angel of the Lord had a walking stick in his hand. With the tip of the stick he touched the meat and the bread. Fire blazed out of the rock. It burned up the meat and the bread. Then the angel of the Lord disappeared.
Judges,6,22,"Gideon realized it was the angel of the Lord . He cried out, “Oh no, my Lord and King, I have seen the angel of the Lord face to face!”"
Judges,6,23,"But the Lord said to him, “May peace be with you! Do not be afraid. You are not going to die.”"
Judges,6,24,So Gideon built an altar there to honor the Lord . He called it The Lord Is Peace. It still stands in Ophrah to this day. Ophrah is in the territory that belongs to the family line of Abiezer.
Judges,6,25,"That same night the Lord spoke to Gideon. He said, “Get the second bull from your father’s herd. Get the one that is seven years old. Tear down the altar your father built to honor the god named Baal. Cut down the pole beside it. The pole is used to worship the female god named Asherah."
Judges,6,26,Then build the right kind of altar. Build it to honor the Lord your God. Build it on top of this hill. Then use the wood from the Asherah pole you cut down. Sacrifice the second bull as a burnt offering.”
Judges,6,27,So Gideon went and got ten of his servants. He did just as the Lord had told him. But he was afraid of his family. He was also afraid of the people in the town. So he did everything at night instead of during the day.
Judges,6,28,In the morning the people in the town got up. They saw that Baal’s altar had been torn down. The Asherah pole beside it had been cut down. And the second bull had been sacrificed on the new altar that had been built.
Judges,6,29,"They asked each other, “Who did this?” They looked into the matter carefully. Someone told them, “Gideon, the son of Joash, did it.”"
Judges,6,30,"The people in the town spoke to Joash. They ordered him, “Bring your son out here. He must die. He has torn down Baal’s altar. He has cut down the Asherah pole beside it.”"
Judges,6,31,"But Joash replied to the angry crowd around him. He asked, “Are you going to stand up for Baal? Are you trying to save him? Those who stand up for him will be put to death by morning! Is Baal really a god? If he is, he can stand up for himself when someone tears down his altar.”"
Judges,6,32,"That’s why they gave Gideon the name Jerub-Baal on that day. Gideon had torn down Baal’s altar. So they said, “Let Baal take his stand against him.”"
Judges,6,33,All the Midianites and Amalekites gathered their armies together. Other tribes from the east joined them. All of them went across the Jordan River. They camped in the Valley of Jezreel.
Judges,6,34,Then the Spirit of the Lord came on Gideon. So Gideon blew a trumpet to send for the men of Abiezer. He told them to follow him.
Judges,6,35,"He sent messengers all through Manasseh’s territory. He called for the men of Manasseh to fight. He also sent messengers to the men of Asher, Zebulun and Naphtali. So all those men went up to join the others."
Judges,6,36,"Gideon said to God, “You promised you would use me to save Israel."
Judges,6,37,Please do something for me. I’ll put a piece of wool on the threshing floor. Suppose dew is only on the wool tomorrow morning. And suppose the ground all around it is dry. Then I will know that you will use me to save Israel. I’ll know that your promise will come true.”
Judges,6,38,And that’s what happened. Gideon got up early the next day. He squeezed the dew out of the wool. The water filled a bowl.
Judges,6,39,"Then Gideon said to God, “Don’t be angry with me. Let me ask you for just one more thing. Let me use the wool for one more test. But this time make the wool dry. And let the ground be covered with dew.”"
Judges,6,40,So that night God did it. Only the wool was dry. The ground all around it was covered with dew.
Judges,7,1,Early in the morning Jerub-Baal and all his men camped at the spring of Harod. Jerub-Baal was another name for Gideon. The camp of Midian was north of Gideon’s camp. It was in the valley near the hill of Moreh.
Judges,7,2,"The Lord said to Gideon, “I want to hand Midian over to you. But you have too many men for me to do that. Then Israel might brag, ‘My own strength has saved me.’"
Judges,7,3,"So here is what I want you to announce to the army. Tell them, ‘Those who tremble with fear can turn back. They can leave Mount Gilead.’ ” So 22,000 men left. But 10,000 remained."
Judges,7,4,"The Lord said to Gideon, “There are still too many men. So take them down to the water. There I will reduce the number of them for you. If I say, ‘This one will go with you,’ he will go. But if I say, ‘That one will not go with you,’ he will not go.”"
Judges,7,5,"So Gideon took the men down to the water. There the Lord said to him, “Some men will drink the way dogs do. They will lap up the water with their tongues. Separate them from those who get down on their knees to drink.”"
Judges,7,6,Three hundred men brought up the water to their mouths with their hands. And they lapped it up the way dogs do. All the rest got down on their knees to drink.
Judges,7,7,"The Lord spoke to Gideon. He said, “With the help of the 300 men who lapped up the water I will save you. I will hand the Midianites over to you. Let all the other men go home.”"
Judges,7,8,So Gideon sent those Israelites home. But he kept the 300 men. They took over the supplies and trumpets the others had left. The Midianites had set up their camp in the valley below where Gideon was.
Judges,7,9,"During that night the Lord said to Gideon, “Get up. Go down against the camp. I am going to hand it over to you."
Judges,7,10,But what if you are afraid to attack? Then go down to the camp with your servant Purah.
Judges,7,11,"Listen to what they are saying. After that, you will not be afraid to attack the camp.” So Gideon and his servant Purah went down to the edge of the camp."
Judges,7,12,"The Midianites had set up their camp in the valley. So had the Amalekites and all the other tribes from the east. There were so many of them that they looked like huge numbers of locusts. Like the grains of sand on the seashore, their camels couldn’t be counted."
Judges,7,13,"Gideon arrived just as a man was telling a friend about his dream. “I had a dream,” he was saying. “A round loaf of barley bread came rolling into the camp of Midian. It hit a tent with great force. The tent turned over and fell down flat.”"
Judges,7,14,"His friend replied, “That can only be the sword of Gideon, the son of Joash. Gideon is from Israel. God has handed the Midianites over to him. He has given him the whole camp.”"
Judges,7,15,"Gideon heard the man explain what the dream meant. Then Gideon bowed down and worshiped. He returned to the camp of Israel. He called out, “Get up! The Lord has handed the Midianites over to you.”"
Judges,7,16,Gideon separated the 300 men into three fighting groups. He put a trumpet and an empty jar into the hands of each man. And he put a torch inside each jar.
Judges,7,17,"“Watch me,” he told them. “Do what I do. I’ll go to the edge of the enemy camp. Then do exactly as I do."
Judges,7,18,"I and everyone with me will blow our trumpets. Then blow your trumpets from your positions all around the camp. And shout the battle cry, ‘For the Lord and for Gideon!’ ”"
Judges,7,19,Gideon and the 100 men with him reached the edge of the enemy camp. It was about ten o’clock at night. It was just after the guard had been changed. Gideon and his men blew their trumpets. They broke the jars that were in their hands.
Judges,7,20,"The three fighting groups blew their trumpets. They smashed their jars. They held their torches in their left hands. They held in their right hands the trumpets they were going to blow. Then they shouted the battle cry, “A sword for the Lord and for Gideon!”"
Judges,7,21,Each man stayed in his position around the camp. But all the Midianites ran away in fear. They were crying out as they ran.
Judges,7,22,"When the 300 trumpets were blown, the Lord caused all the men in the enemy camp to start fighting one another. They attacked one another with their swords. The army ran away to Beth Shittah toward Zererah. They ran all the way to the border of Abel Meholah near Tabbath."
Judges,7,23,"Israelites from the tribes of Naphtali, Asher and all of Manasseh were called out. They chased the Midianites."
Judges,7,24,"Gideon sent messengers through the entire hill country of Ephraim. They said, “Come on down against the Midianites. Take control of the waters of the Jordan River before they get there. Do it all the way to Beth Barah.” So all the men of Ephraim were called out. They took control of the waters of the Jordan all the way to Beth Barah."
Judges,7,25,They also captured Oreb and Zeeb. Those men were two of the Midianite leaders. The men of Ephraim killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb. They killed Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb. They chased the Midianites. And they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon. He was by the Jordan River.
Judges,8,1,"The men of Ephraim asked Gideon, “Why have you treated us like this? Why didn’t you ask us to help you when you went out to fight against Midian?” In anger they challenged Gideon."
Judges,8,2,"But he answered them, “What I’ve done isn’t anything compared to what you have done. Ephraim’s grapes have been gathered. Isn’t what is left over better than all the grapes that have been gathered from Abiezer’s vines?"
Judges,8,3,"God handed Oreb and Zeeb over to you. They were Midianite leaders. So what was I able to do compared to what you did?” After Gideon had said that, they didn’t feel angry with him anymore."
Judges,8,4,Gideon and his 300 men were very tired. But they kept on chasing their enemies. They came to the Jordan River and went across it.
Judges,8,5,"Gideon said to the men of Sukkoth, “Give my troops some bread. They are worn out. And I’m still chasing Zebah and Zalmunna. They are the kings of Midian.”"
Judges,8,6,"But the officials of Sukkoth objected. They said, “Have you already killed Zebah and Zalmunna? Have you cut their hands off and brought them back to prove it? If you haven’t, why should we give bread to your troops?”"
Judges,8,7,"Gideon replied, “The Lord will hand Zebah and Zalmunna over to me. When he does, I’ll tear your skin with thorns from desert bushes.”"
Judges,8,8,From there Gideon went up to Peniel. He asked its men for the same thing. But they answered as the men of Sukkoth had.
Judges,8,9,"So he said to the men of Peniel, “I’ll be back after I’ve won the battle. Then I’ll tear down this tower.”"
Judges,8,10,"Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor. They had an army of about 15,000 men. That’s all that were left of the armies of the tribes from the east. About 120,000 men who carried swords had died in battle."
Judges,8,11,Gideon went up the trail the people of the desert had made. It ran east of Nobah and Jogbehah. He attacked the army by surprise.
Judges,8,12,Zebah and Zalmunna ran away. They were the two kings of Midian. Gideon chased them and captured them. He destroyed their whole army.
Judges,8,13,"Then Gideon, the son of Joash, returned from the battle. He came back through the Pass of Heres."
Judges,8,14,He caught a young man from Sukkoth. He asked him about the elders of the town. The young man wrote down for him the names of Sukkoth’s 77 officials.
Judges,8,15,"Then Gideon came and said to the men of Sukkoth, “Here are Zebah and Zalmunna. You made fun of me because of them. You said, ‘Have you already killed Zebah and Zalmunna? Have you cut their hands off and brought them back to prove it? If you haven’t, why should we give bread to your tired men?’ ”"
Judges,8,16,Gideon went and got the elders of the town. Then he taught the men of Sukkoth a lesson. He tore their skin with thorns from desert bushes.
Judges,8,17,He also pulled down the tower at Peniel. He killed the men in the town.
Judges,8,18,"Then he spoke to Zebah and Zalmunna. He asked, “What were the men like that you killed at Tabor?” “Men like you,” they answered. “Each one walked as if he were a prince.”"
Judges,8,19,"Gideon replied, “Those were my brothers. They were the sons of my own mother. You can be sure that the Lord lives. And you can be just as sure that if you had spared their lives, I wouldn’t kill you.”"
Judges,8,20,"Then Gideon turned to his oldest son Jether. He said, “Kill them!” But Jether didn’t pull out his sword. He was only a boy. So he was afraid."
Judges,8,21,"Zebah and Zalmunna said, “Come on. Do it yourself. ‘The older the man, the stronger he is.’ ” So Gideon stepped forward and killed them. Then he took the gold chains off the necks of their camels."
Judges,8,22,"The Israelites said to Gideon, “Rule over us. We want you, your son and your grandson to be our rulers. You have saved us from the power of Midian.”"
Judges,8,23,"But Gideon told them, “I will not rule over you. My son won’t rule over you either. The Lord will rule over you.”"
Judges,8,24,"He continued, “I do ask one thing. I want each of you to give me an earring. I’m talking about the earrings you took from your enemies.” It was the practice of the people in the family line of Ishmael to wear gold earrings."
Judges,8,25,"The Israelites said, “We’ll be glad to give them to you.” So they spread out a piece of clothing. Each of them threw a ring on it from what he had taken."
Judges,8,26,The weight of the gold rings Gideon asked for was 43 pounds. That didn’t include the moon-shaped necklaces the kings of Midian had worn. It didn’t include their other necklaces or their purple clothes. And it didn’t include the gold chains that had been on the necks of their camels.
Judges,8,27,Gideon made an object out of all the gold. It looked like the linen apron the high priest of Israel wore. Gideon placed it in Ophrah. That was his hometown. All the Israelites worshiped it there. They weren’t faithful to the Lord . So the gold object became a trap to Gideon and his family.
Judges,8,28,Israel brought Midian under their control. Midian wasn’t able to attack Israel anymore. So the land was at peace for 40 years. The peace lasted as long as Gideon was living.
Judges,8,29,"Jerub-Baal, the son of Joash, went back home to live. Jerub-Baal was another name for Gideon."
Judges,8,30,He had 70 sons of his own. That’s because he had many wives.
Judges,8,31,And he had a concubine who lived in Shechem. She also had a son by him. Gideon named that son Abimelek.
Judges,8,32,"Gideon, the son of Joash, died when he was very old. He was buried in the tomb of his father Joash in Ophrah. Ophrah was in the territory that belonged to the family line of Abiezer."
Judges,8,33,"As soon as Gideon had died, the Israelites began serving and worshiping gods that were named Baal. Israel wasn’t faithful to the Lord . They worshiped Baal-Berith as their god."
Judges,8,34,They forgot what the Lord their God had done for them. He had saved them from the power of their enemies all around them.
Judges,8,35,Jerub-Baal had done many good things for the Israelites. But they weren’t faithful to his family. Jerub-Baal was another name for Gideon.
Judges,9,1,"Abimelek was the son of Jerub-Baal. He went to his mother’s brothers in Shechem. He spoke to them and to all the members of his mother’s family group. He said,"
Judges,9,2,"“Speak to all the citizens of Shechem. Tell them, ‘You can have all 70 of Jerub-Baal’s sons rule over you. Or you can have just one man rule over you. Which would you rather have?’ Remember, I’m your own flesh and blood.”"
Judges,9,3,"The brothers told all of that to the citizens of Shechem. Then the people decided to follow Abimelek. They said, “He’s related to us.”"
Judges,9,4,They gave him 28 ounces of silver. They had taken it from the temple of the god named Baal-Berith. Abimelek used it to hire some men. They were wild and weren’t good for anything. They became his followers.
Judges,9,5,Abimelek went to his father’s home in Ophrah. There on a big rock he murdered his 70 brothers. All of them were the sons of Jerub-Baal. But Jotham escaped by hiding. He was Jerub-Baal’s youngest son.
Judges,9,6,All the citizens of Shechem and Beth Millo came together. They gathered at the stone pillar that was beside the large tree in Shechem. They wanted to crown Abimelek as their king.
Judges,9,7,"Jotham was told about it. So he climbed up on top of Mount Gerizim. He shouted down to them, “Citizens of Shechem! Listen to me! Then God will listen to you."
Judges,9,8,"One day the trees went out to anoint a king for themselves. They said to an olive tree, ‘Be our king.’"
Judges,9,9,"“But the olive tree answered, ‘Should I give up my olive oil? It’s used to honor gods and people alike. Should I give that up just to rule over the trees?’"
Judges,9,10,"“Next, the trees said to a fig tree, ‘Come and be our king.’"
Judges,9,11,"“But the fig tree replied, ‘Should I give up my fruit? It’s so good and sweet. Should I give that up just to rule over the trees?’"
Judges,9,12,"“Then the trees said to a vine, ‘Come and be our king.’"
Judges,9,13,"“But the vine answered, ‘Should I give up my wine? It cheers up gods and people alike. Should I give that up just to rule over the trees?’"
Judges,9,14,"“Finally, all the trees spoke to a bush that had thorns. They said, ‘Come and be our king.’"
Judges,9,15,"“The bush asked the trees, ‘Do you really want to anoint me as king over you? If you do, come and rest in my shade. But if you don’t, I will destroy you! Fire will come out of me and burn up the cedar trees of Lebanon!’"
Judges,9,16,“Did you act in an honest way when you made Abimelek your king? Did you really do the right thing? Have you been fair to Jerub-Baal and his family? Have you given him the honor he’s worthy of?
Judges,9,17,Remember that my father fought for you. He put his life in danger for you. He saved you from the power of Midian.
Judges,9,18,But today you have turned against my father’s family. You have murdered his 70 sons on a big rock. Abimelek is only the son of my father’s female slave. But you have made him king over the citizens of Shechem. You have done that because he’s related to you.
Judges,9,19,"Have you citizens of Shechem and Beth Millo acted in an honest way toward Jerub-Baal? Have you done the right thing to his family today? If you have, may you be happy with Abimelek! And may he be happy with you!"
Judges,9,20,"But if you haven’t, let fire come out from Abimelek and burn you up! And let fire come out from you and burn Abimelek up!”"
Judges,9,21,Then Jotham ran away. He escaped to a town named Beer. He lived there because he was afraid of his brother Abimelek.
Judges,9,22,Abimelek ruled over Israel for three years.
Judges,9,23,Then God stirred up trouble between Abimelek and the citizens of Shechem. So they turned against Abimelek. They decided not to follow him anymore.
Judges,9,24,God made that happen because of what Abimelek had done to Jerub-Baal’s 70 sons. He had spilled their blood. God wanted to punish their brother Abimelek for doing that. He also wanted to punish the citizens of Shechem. They had helped Abimelek murder his brothers.
Judges,9,25,The citizens of Shechem didn’t want Abimelek to be their ruler anymore. So they hid some men on top of the hills. They wanted them to attack and rob everyone who passed by. Abimelek was told about it.
Judges,9,26,Gaal and his relatives moved into Shechem. Gaal was the son of Ebed. The citizens of Shechem put their trust in Gaal.
Judges,9,27,"The people of Shechem went out into the fields. They gathered the grapes. They pressed the juice out of them by stomping on them. Then they held a feast in the temple of their god. While they were eating and drinking, they cursed Abimelek."
Judges,9,28,"Then Gaal, the son of Ebed, said, “Who is Abimelek? And who is Shechem? Why should we citizens of Shechem be under Abimelek’s rule? Isn’t he Jerub-Baal’s son? Isn’t Zebul his helper? It would be better to serve the family of Hamor. He was the father of Shechem. So why should we serve Abimelek?"
Judges,9,29,"I wish these people were under my command. Then I would get rid of Abimelek. I would say to him, ‘Call out your whole army!’ ”"
Judges,9,30,"Zebul was the governor of Shechem. He heard about what Gaal, the son of Ebed, had said. So he was very angry."
Judges,9,31,"Zebul secretly sent messengers to Abimelek. They said, “Gaal, the son of Ebed, has come to Shechem. His relatives have come with him. They are stirring up the city against you."
Judges,9,32,So come with your men during the night. Hide in the fields and wait.
Judges,9,33,"In the morning at sunrise, attack the city. Gaal and his men will come out against you. Then take that opportunity to attack them.”"
Judges,9,34,So Abimelek and all his troops started out at night. They went into their hiding places near Shechem. Abimelek had separated them into four fighting groups.
Judges,9,35,"Gaal, the son of Ebed, had already gone out. He was standing at the entrance of the city gate. He had arrived there just as Abimelek and his troops came out of their hiding places."
Judges,9,36,"Gaal saw them. He said to Zebul, “Look! People are coming down from the tops of the mountains!” Zebul replied, “You are wrong. Those aren’t people. They are just the shadows of the mountains.”"
Judges,9,37,"But Gaal spoke up again. He said, “Look! People are coming down from the central hill. Another group is coming from the direction of the fortune tellers’ tree.”"
Judges,9,38,"Then Zebul said to Gaal, “Where is your big talk now? You said, ‘Who is Abimelek? Why should we be under his rule?’ Aren’t these the people you made fun of? Go out and fight against them!”"
Judges,9,39,So Gaal led the citizens out of Shechem. They fought against Abimelek.
Judges,9,40,He chased Gaal from the field of battle. Abimelek chased them all the way to the entrance of the city gate. Many men were killed as they ran away.
Judges,9,41,Abimelek stayed in Arumah. And Zebul drove Gaal and his relatives out of Shechem.
Judges,9,42,The next day the people of Shechem went out to work in the fields. Abimelek was told about it.
Judges,9,43,"So he gathered his men together. He separated them into three fighting groups. Then he hid them in the fields and told them to wait. When he saw the people coming out of the city, he got up to attack them."
Judges,9,44,Abimelek and the men with him ran forward. They placed themselves at the entrance of the city gate. Then the other two groups attacked the people in the fields. There they struck them down.
Judges,9,45,Abimelek kept up his attack against the city all day long. He didn’t stop until he had captured it. Then he killed its people. He destroyed the city. He scattered salt on it to make sure that nothing would be able to grow there.
Judges,9,46,The citizens in the tower of Shechem heard about what was happening. So they went to the safest place in the temple of the god named El-Berith.
Judges,9,47,Abimelek heard that they had gathered together there.
Judges,9,48,He and all his men went up Mount Zalmon. He got an ax and cut off some branches. He carried them on his shoulders. He ordered the men with him to do the same thing. “Quick!” he said. “Do what you have seen me do!”
Judges,9,49,"So all the men cut branches and followed Abimelek. They piled them against the place where the people had gone for safety. Then they set the place on fire with the people still inside. There were about 1,000 men and women in the tower of Shechem. All of them died."
Judges,9,50,"Next, Abimelek went to Thebez. He surrounded it. Then he attacked it and captured it."
Judges,9,51,But inside the city there was a strong tower. All the people in the city had run to it for safety. All the men and women had gone into it. They had locked themselves in. They had climbed up on the roof of the tower.
Judges,9,52,Abimelek went to the tower and attacked it. He approached the entrance to the tower to set it on fire.
Judges,9,53,But a woman dropped a large millstone on him. It broke his head open.
Judges,9,54,"He quickly called out to the man carrying his armor. He said, “Pull out your sword and kill me. Then people can’t say, ‘A woman killed him.’ ” So his servant stuck his sword through him. And Abimelek died."
Judges,9,55,"When the Israelites saw he was dead, they went home."
Judges,9,56,That’s how God punished Abimelek for the evil thing he had done to his father. He had murdered his 70 brothers.
Judges,9,57,God also made the people of Shechem pay for all the evil things they had done. The curse of Jotham came down on them. He was the son of Jerub-Baal.
Judges,10,1,"Tola rose up to save Israel. That happened after the time of Abimelek. Tola was from the tribe of Issachar. He was the son of Puah, who was the son of Dodo. Tola lived in Shamir. It’s in the hill country of Ephraim."
Judges,10,2,"Tola led Israel for 23 years. After he died, he was buried in Shamir."
Judges,10,3,Jair became the leader after Tola. Jair was from the land of Gilead. He led Israel for 22 years.
Judges,10,4,He had 30 sons. They rode on 30 donkeys. His sons controlled 30 towns in Gilead. Those towns are called Havvoth Jair to this day.
Judges,10,5,"After Jair died, he was buried in Kamon."
Judges,10,6,Once again the Israelites did what was evil in the sight of the Lord . They served gods that were named Baal. They served female gods that were named Ashtoreth. They worshiped the gods of Aram and Sidon. They served the gods of Moab and Ammon. They also worshiped the gods of the Philistines. The Israelites deserted the Lord . They didn’t serve him anymore.
Judges,10,7,So the Lord became very angry with them. He handed them over to the Philistines and the Ammonites.
Judges,10,8,That year they broke Israel’s power completely. They treated the Israelites badly for 18 years. The people who did this lived east of the Jordan River. They lived in Gilead. That was the land of the Amorites.
Judges,10,9,"The Ammonites also went across the Jordan. They crossed over to fight against the tribes of Judah, Benjamin and Ephraim. Israel was suffering terribly."
Judges,10,10,"Then the Israelites cried out to the Lord . They said, “We have sinned against you. We have deserted our God. We have served gods that are named Baal.”"
Judges,10,11,"The Lord replied, “The Egyptians and Amorites treated you badly. So did the Ammonites and Philistines."
Judges,10,12,And so did the Amalekites and the people of Sidon and Maon. Each time you cried out to me for help. And I saved you from their power.
Judges,10,13,But you have deserted me. You have served other gods. So I will not save you anymore.
Judges,10,14,Go and cry out to the gods you have chosen. Let them save you when you get into trouble!”
Judges,10,15,"But the Israelites replied to the Lord , “We have sinned. Do to us what you think is best. But please save us now.”"
Judges,10,16,Then they got rid of the false gods that were among them. They served the Lord . And he couldn’t stand to see Israel suffer anymore.
Judges,10,17,The Ammonites were called together to fight. They camped in the land of Gilead. Then the Israelites gathered together. They camped at the city of Mizpah.
Judges,10,18,"The leaders of Gilead spoke to one another. They said, “Who will lead the attack against the Ammonites? That person will be the ruler of all the people who live in Gilead.”"
Judges,11,1,Jephthah was a mighty warrior. He was from the land of Gilead. His father’s name was Gilead. Jephthah’s mother was a prostitute.
Judges,11,2,"Gilead’s wife also had sons by him. When they had grown up, they drove Jephthah away. “You aren’t going to get any share of our family’s property,” they said. “You are the son of another woman.”"
Judges,11,3,So Jephthah ran away from his brothers. He made his home in the land of Tob. A group of men who weren’t good for anything gathered around him there. And they followed him.
Judges,11,4,"Some time later, the Ammonites were fighting against Israel."
Judges,11,5,So the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah from the land of Tob.
Judges,11,6,"“Come with us,” they said. “Be our commander. Then we can fight against the Ammonites.”"
Judges,11,7,"Jephthah said to them, “Didn’t you hate me? Didn’t you drive me away from my father’s house? Why are you coming to me only when you are in trouble?”"
Judges,11,8,"The elders of Gilead replied to him. “You are right,” they said. “That’s why we’re turning to you now. Come with us and fight against the Ammonites. Then you will rule over all of us who live in Gilead.”"
Judges,11,9,"Jephthah said, “Suppose you take me back to fight against the Ammonites. And suppose the Lord gives me victory over them. Then will I really be your leader?”"
Judges,11,10,"The elders of Gilead replied, “The Lord is our witness. We’ll certainly do as you say.”"
Judges,11,11,So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead. And the people made him their leader and commander. He went to Mizpah. There he repeated to the Lord everything he had said.
Judges,11,12,"Then Jephthah sent messengers to the king of Ammon. They asked, “What do you have against me? Why have you attacked my country?”"
Judges,11,13,"The king of Ammon answered Jephthah’s messengers. He said, “Israel came up out of Egypt. At that time they took my land away. They took all the land between the Arnon River and the Jabbok River. It reached all the way to the Jordan River. Now give it back. Then there will be peace.”"
Judges,11,14,Jephthah sent messengers back to the king of Ammon.
Judges,11,15,"They said, “Here is what Jephthah says to you. Israel didn’t take the land of Moab. They didn’t take the land of Ammon."
Judges,11,16,"When Israel came up out of Egypt, they went through the desert to the Red Sea. From there they went on to Kadesh."
Judges,11,17,"Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom. They said, ‘Please let us go through your country.’ But the king of Edom wouldn’t listen to them. They sent the same message to the king of Moab. But he refused too. So Israel stayed at Kadesh."
Judges,11,18,"“Next, they traveled through the desert. They traveled along the borders of the lands of Edom and Moab. They passed along the east side of the country of Moab. They camped on the other side of the Arnon River. They didn’t enter the territory of Moab. The Arnon River was Moab’s border."
Judges,11,19,"“Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon. He was the king of the Amorites. He ruled in Heshbon. They said to him, ‘Let us pass through your country to our own land.’"
Judges,11,20,"But Sihon didn’t trust Israel to pass through his territory. Instead, he gathered all his troops together. They camped at Jahaz. And they fought against Israel."
Judges,11,21,"“Then the Lord , the God of Israel, handed Sihon and his whole army over to Israel. Israel won the battle over them. Amorites were living in the country at that time. And Israel took over all their land."
Judges,11,22,Israel captured all the land between the Arnon River and the Jabbok River. It reached from the desert all the way to the Jordan River.
Judges,11,23,"“The Lord , the God of Israel, has driven the Amorites out to make room for his people. So what right do you have to take it over?"
Judges,11,24,"You will take what your god Chemosh gives you, won’t you? In the same way, we will take over what the Lord our God has given us."
Judges,11,25,"Are you any better than Balak, the son of Zippor? Balak was the king of Moab. Did he ever argue with Israel? Did he ever fight against them?"
Judges,11,26,For 300 years Israel has been living in Heshbon and Aroer. They have been living in the settlements around those cities. They have also been living in all the towns along the Arnon River. Why didn’t you take those places back during that time?
Judges,11,27,I haven’t done anything wrong to you. But you are doing something wrong to me. You have gone to war against me. The Lord is the Judge. So let him decide our case today. Let him settle matters between the Israelites and the Ammonites.”
Judges,11,28,But the king of Ammon didn’t pay any attention to the message Jephthah sent him.
Judges,11,29,Then the Spirit of the Lord came on Jephthah. He went across the territories of Gilead and Manasseh. He passed through Mizpah in the land of Gilead. From there he attacked the people of Ammon.
Judges,11,30,"Jephthah made a promise to the Lord . Jephthah said, “Hand the Ammonites over to me."
Judges,11,31,"If you do, here’s what I’ll do when I come back from winning the battle. Anything that comes out the door of my house to meet me will belong to the Lord . I will sacrifice it as a burnt offering.”"
Judges,11,32,Then Jephthah went over to fight against the Ammonites. The Lord handed them over to him.
Judges,11,33,Jephthah destroyed 20 towns between Aroer and the area of Minnith. He destroyed them all the way to Abel Keramim. So Israel brought Ammon under their control.
Judges,11,34,Jephthah returned to his home in Mizpah. And guess who came out to meet him. It was his daughter! She was dancing to the beat of tambourines. She was his only child. He didn’t have any other sons or daughters.
Judges,11,35,"When Jephthah saw her, he was so upset that he tore his clothes. He cried out, “Oh no, my daughter! You have filled me with trouble and sorrow. I’ve made a promise to the Lord . And I can’t break it.”"
Judges,11,36,"“My father,” she replied, “you have given your word to the Lord . So do to me just what you promised to do. The Ammonites were your enemies. And the Lord has paid them back for what they did to you."
Judges,11,37,"But please do one thing for me,” she continued. “Give me two months to wander around in the hills. Let me weep there with my friends. I want to do that because I’ll never get married.”"
Judges,11,38,"“You may go,” he said. He let her go for two months. She and her friends went into the hills. They were filled with sadness because she would never get married."
Judges,11,39,"After the two months were over, she returned to her father. He did to her just what he had promised to do. And she was a virgin. So that became a practice in Israel."
Judges,11,40,Each year the young women of Israel go away for four days. They do it in honor of the daughter of Jephthah. He was from the land of Gilead.
Judges,12,1,"The troops of Ephraim were called out. The troops went across the Jordan River to Zaphon. When they arrived, they said to Jephthah, “You went to fight against the Ammonites. Why didn’t you ask us to go with you? We’re going to burn down your house over your head.”"
Judges,12,2,"Jephthah answered, “I and my people were taking part in a great struggle. We were at war with the Ammonites. I asked you for help. But you didn’t come to save me from their power."
Judges,12,3,I saw that you wouldn’t help. So I put my own life in danger. I went across the Jordan to fight against the Ammonites. The Lord helped me win the battle over them. So why have you come up today to fight against me?”
Judges,12,4,"Then Jephthah called the men of Gilead together. They fought against Ephraim. The men of Gilead struck them down. The people of Ephraim had said, “You people of Gilead are nothing but deserters from Ephraim and Manasseh.”"
Judges,12,5,"The men of Gilead captured the places where people go across the Jordan River to get to Ephraim. Some men of Ephraim weren’t killed in the battle. When they arrived at the river, they would say, “Let us go across.” Then the men of Gilead would ask each one, “Are you from Ephraim?” Suppose he replied, “No.”"
Judges,12,6,"Then they would say, “All right. Say ‘Shibboleth.’ ” If he said “Sibboleth,” the way he said the word would give him away. He couldn’t say it correctly. So they would grab him. Then they would kill him at one of the places where people go across the Jordan. At that time, 42,000 men of Ephraim were killed."
Judges,12,7,Jephthah led Israel for six years. Then he died. He was buried in a town in Gilead. Jephthah was from the land of Gilead.
Judges,12,8,"After Jephthah, Ibzan from Bethlehem led Israel."
Judges,12,9,He had 30 sons and 30 daughters. He gave his daughters to be married to men who were outside his family group. He brought in 30 young women to be married to his sons. Those women also came from outside his family group. Ibzan led Israel for seven years.
Judges,12,10,Then he died. He was buried in Bethlehem.
Judges,12,11,"After Ibzan, Elon led Israel. He was from the tribe of Zebulun. Elon led Israel for ten years."
Judges,12,12,Then he died. He was buried in Aijalon. It was in the land of Zebulun.
Judges,12,13,"After Elon, Abdon led Israel. Abdon was the son of Hillel. Abdon was from Pirathon."
Judges,12,14,He had 40 sons and 30 grandsons. They rode on 70 donkeys. Abdon led Israel for eight years.
Judges,12,15,Then he died. He was buried at Pirathon in Ephraim. Pirathon was in the hill country of the Amalekites. Abdon was the son of Hillel.
Judges,13,1,Once again the Israelites did what was evil in the sight of the Lord . So the Lord handed them over to the Philistines for 40 years.
Judges,13,2,A certain man from Zorah was named Manoah. He was from the tribe of Dan. Manoah had a wife who wasn’t able to have children.
Judges,13,3,"The angel of the Lord appeared to Manoah’s wife. He said, “You are not able to have children. But you are going to become pregnant. You will have a baby boy."
Judges,13,4,Make sure you do not drink any kind of wine. Also make sure you do not eat anything that is ‘unclean.’
Judges,13,5,You will become pregnant. You will have a son. The hair on his head must never be cut. That is because the boy will be a Nazirite. He will be set apart to God from the day he is born. He will take the lead in saving Israel from the power of the Philistines.”
Judges,13,6,"Then the woman went to her husband. She told him, “A man of God came to me. He looked like an angel of God. His appearance was so amazing that it filled me with great wonder. I didn’t ask him where he came from. And he didn’t tell me his name."
Judges,13,7,"But he said to me, ‘You will become pregnant. You will have a son. So do not drink any kind of wine. Do not eat anything that is “unclean.” That is because the boy will be a Nazirite. He will belong to God in a special way from the day he is born until the day he dies.’ ”"
Judges,13,8,"Then Manoah prayed to the Lord . He said, “Pardon your servant, Lord. I beg you to let the man of God you sent to us come again. He told us we would have a son. We want the man of God to teach us how to bring up the boy.”"
Judges,13,9,God heard Manoah. And the angel of God came again to the woman. He came while she was out in the field. But her husband Manoah wasn’t with her.
Judges,13,10,"The woman hurried to her husband. She told him, “He’s here! The man who appeared to me the other day is here!”"
Judges,13,11,"Manoah got up and followed his wife. When he came to the man, he spoke to him. He said, “Are you the man who talked to my wife?” “I am,” he replied."
Judges,13,12,"So Manoah asked him, “What will happen when your words come true? What rules should we follow for the boy’s life and work?”"
Judges,13,13,"The angel of the Lord answered him. He said, “Your wife must do everything I have told her to do."
Judges,13,14,She must not eat anything that comes from grapevines. She must not drink any kind of wine. She must not eat anything that is ‘unclean.’ She must do everything I have commanded her to do.”
Judges,13,15,"Manoah said to the angel of the Lord , “We would like you to stay and eat. We want to prepare a young goat for you.”"
Judges,13,16,"The angel of the Lord replied, “Even if I stay, I will not eat any of your food. But if you still want to prepare a burnt offering, you must offer it to the Lord .” Manoah didn’t realize it was the angel of the Lord."
Judges,13,17,Then Manoah asked the angel of the Lord a question. “What is your name?” he said. “We want to honor you when your word comes true.”
Judges,13,18,"The angel replied, “Why are you asking me what my name is? You would not be able to understand it.”"
Judges,13,19,Manoah got a young goat. He brought it along with the grain offering. He sacrificed it on a rock to the Lord . Then the Lord did an amazing thing. It happened while Manoah and his wife were watching.
Judges,13,20,"A flame blazed up from the altar toward heaven. The angel of the Lord rose up in the flame. When Manoah and his wife saw it, they fell with their faces to the ground."
Judges,13,21,The angel of the Lord didn’t show himself again to Manoah and his wife. Then Manoah realized it was the angel of the Lord.
Judges,13,22,“We’re going to die!” he said to his wife. “We’ve seen God!”
Judges,13,23,"But his wife answered, “The Lord doesn’t want to kill us. If he did, he wouldn’t have accepted a burnt offering and a grain offering from us. He wouldn’t have shown us all these things. He wouldn’t have told us we’re going to have a son.”"
Judges,13,24,"Later, the woman had a baby boy. She named him Samson. As he grew up, the Lord blessed him."
Judges,13,25,The Spirit of the Lord began to work in his life. It happened while he was in Mahaneh Dan. That place is between Zorah and Eshtaol.
Judges,14,1,Samson went down to Timnah. There he saw a young Philistine woman.
Judges,14,2,"When he returned, he spoke to his father and mother. He said, “I’ve seen a Philistine woman in Timnah. Get her for me. I want her to be my wife.”"
Judges,14,3,"His father and mother replied, “Can’t we find a wife for you among your relatives? Isn’t there one among any of our people? Do you have to go to the Philistines to get a wife? They aren’t God’s people. They haven’t even been circumcised.” But Samson said to his father, “Get her for me. She’s the right one for me.”"
Judges,14,4,Samson’s parents didn’t know that the Lord wanted things to happen this way. He was working out his plans against the Philistines. That’s because the Philistines were ruling over Israel at that time.
Judges,14,5,Samson went down to Timnah. His father and mother went with him. They approached the vineyards of Timnah. Suddenly a young lion came roaring toward Samson.
Judges,14,6,Then the Spirit of the Lord came powerfully on Samson. So he tore the lion apart with his bare hands. He did it as easily as he might have torn a young goat apart. But he didn’t tell his father or mother what he had done.
Judges,14,7,Then he went down and talked with the woman. He liked her.
Judges,14,8,"Some time later, he was going back to marry her. But he turned off the road to look at the lion’s dead body. He saw large numbers of bees and some honey in it."
Judges,14,9,He dug out the honey with his hands. He ate it as he walked along. Then he joined his parents again. He gave them some honey. They ate it too. But he didn’t tell them he had taken it from the lion’s dead body.
Judges,14,10,Samson’s father went down to see the woman. Samson had a feast prepared there. He was following the practice of young men when they married their wives.
Judges,14,11,"When the people saw Samson, they gave him 30 men to be his companions."
Judges,14,12,"“Let me tell you a riddle,” Samson said to the companions. “The feast will last for seven days. Give me the answer to the riddle before the feast ends. If you do, I’ll give you 30 linen shirts. I’ll also give you 30 sets of clothes."
Judges,14,13,"But suppose you can’t give me the answer. Then you must give me 30 linen shirts. You must also give me 30 sets of clothes.” “Tell us your riddle,” they said. “Let’s hear it.”"
Judges,14,14,"Samson replied, “Out of the eater came something to eat. Out of the strong came something sweet.” For three days they couldn’t give him the answer."
Judges,14,15,"On the fourth day they spoke to Samson’s wife. “Get your husband to explain the riddle for us,” they said. “If you don’t, we’ll burn you to death. We’ll burn up everyone in your family. Did you invite us here to steal our property?”"
Judges,14,16,"Then Samson’s wife threw herself on him. She sobbed, “You hate me! You don’t really love me. You have given my people a riddle. But you haven’t told me the answer.” “I haven’t even explained it to my father or mother,” he replied. “So why should I explain it to you?”"
Judges,14,17,She cried during the whole seven days the feast was going on. So on the seventh day he finally told her the answer to the riddle. That’s because she kept on asking him to tell her. Then she explained the riddle to her people.
Judges,14,18,"Before sunset on the seventh day of the feast the men of the town spoke to Samson. They said, “What is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion?” Samson said to them, “You have plowed with my young cow. If you hadn’t, you wouldn’t have known the answer to my riddle.”"
Judges,14,19,Then the Spirit of the Lord came powerfully on Samson. He went down to Ashkelon. He struck down 30 of their men. He took everything they had with them. And he gave their clothes to those who had explained the riddle. Samson was very angry as he returned to his father’s home.
Judges,14,20,Samson’s wife was given to someone else. She was given to a companion of Samson. The companion had helped him at the feast.
Judges,15,1,"Later on, Samson went to visit his wife. He took a young goat with him. He went at the time the wheat was being gathered. He said, “I’m going to my wife’s room.” But her father wouldn’t let him go in."
Judges,15,2,"Her father said, “I was sure you hated her. So I gave her to your companion. Isn’t her younger sister more beautiful? Take her instead.”"
Judges,15,3,"Samson said to them, “This time I have a right to get even with the Philistines. I’m going to hurt them badly.”"
Judges,15,4,So he went out and caught 300 foxes. He tied them in pairs by their tails. Then he tied a torch to each pair of tails.
Judges,15,5,He lit the torches. He let the foxes loose in the fields of grain that belonged to the Philistines. He burned up the grain that had been cut and stacked. He burned up the grain that was still growing. He also burned up the vineyards and olive trees.
Judges,15,6,"The Philistines asked, “Who did this?” They were told, “Samson did. He’s the son-in-law of the man from Timnah. Samson did it because his wife was given to his companion.” So the Philistines went up and burned the woman and her father to death."
Judges,15,7,"Samson said to the Philistines, “Is that how you act? Then I promise I won’t stop until I pay you back.”"
Judges,15,8,He struck them down with heavy blows. He killed many of them. Then he went down and stayed in a cave. It was in the rock of Etam.
Judges,15,9,The Philistines went up and camped in Judah. They spread out near Lehi.
Judges,15,10,"The people of Judah asked, “Why have you come to fight against us?” “We’ve come to take Samson as our prisoner,” they answered. “We want to do to him what he did to us.”"
Judges,15,11,"Then 3,000 men from Judah went to get Samson. They went down to the cave in the rock of Etam. They said to Samson, “Don’t you realize the Philistines are ruling over us? What have you done to us?” Samson answered, “I only did to them what they did to me.”"
Judges,15,12,"The men of Judah said to him, “We’ve come to tie you up. We’re going to hand you over to the Philistines.” Samson said, “Promise me you won’t kill me yourselves.”"
Judges,15,13,"“We agree,” they answered. “We’ll only tie you up and hand you over to them. We won’t kill you.” So they tied him up with two new ropes. They led him up from the rock."
Judges,15,14,Samson approached Lehi. The Philistines came toward him shouting. Then the Spirit of the Lord came powerfully on Samson. The ropes on his arms became like burned thread. They dropped off his hands.
Judges,15,15,"He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey. He grabbed it and struck down 1,000 men."
Judges,15,16,"Then Samson said, “By using a donkey’s jawbone I’ve made them look like donkeys. By using a donkey’s jawbone I’ve struck down 1,000 men.”"
Judges,15,17,Samson finished speaking. Then he threw the jawbone away. That’s why the place was called Ramath Lehi.
Judges,15,18,"Samson was very thirsty. So he cried out to the Lord . He said, “You have helped me win this great battle. Do I have to die of thirst now? Must I fall into the power of people who haven’t even been circumcised? They aren’t your people.”"
Judges,15,19,"Then God opened up the hollow place in Lehi. Water came out of it. When Samson drank the water, his strength returned. He felt as good as new. So the spring was called En Hakkore. It’s still there in Lehi."
Judges,15,20,Samson led Israel for 20 years. In those days the Philistines were in the land.
Judges,16,1,One day Samson went to Gaza. There he saw a prostitute. He went in to spend the night with her.
Judges,16,2,"The people of Gaza were told, “Samson is here!” So they surrounded the place. They hid and waited for him at the city gate all night long. They didn’t make any move against him during the night. They said, “Let’s wait until the sun comes up. Then we’ll kill him.”"
Judges,16,3,"But Samson stayed there only until the middle of the night. Then he got up. He took hold of the doors of the city gate. He also took hold of the two doorposts. He tore them loose, together with their metal bar. He picked them up and put them on his shoulders. Then he carried them to the top of the hill that faces Hebron."
Judges,16,4,"Some time later, Samson fell in love again. The woman lived in the Valley of Sorek. Her name was Delilah."
Judges,16,5,"The rulers of the Philistines went to her. They said, “See if you can get him to tell you the secret of why he’s so strong. Find out how we can overpower him. Then we can tie him up. We can bring him under our control. Each of us will give you 28 pounds of silver.”"
Judges,16,6,"So Delilah said to Samson, “Tell me the secret of why you are so strong. Tell me how you can be tied up and controlled.”"
Judges,16,7,"Samson answered her, “Let someone tie me up with seven new bowstrings. They must be strings that aren’t completely dry. Then I’ll become as weak as any other man.”"
Judges,16,8,So the Philistine rulers brought seven new bowstrings to her. They weren’t completely dry. Delilah tied Samson up with them.
Judges,16,9,"Men were hiding in the room. She called out to him, “Samson! The Philistines are attacking you!” But he snapped the bowstrings easily. They were like pieces of string that had come too close to a flame. So the secret of why he was so strong wasn’t discovered."
Judges,16,10,"Delilah spoke to Samson again. “You have made me look foolish,” she said. “You told me a lie. Come on. Tell me how you can be tied up.”"
Judges,16,11,"Samson said, “Let someone tie me tightly with new ropes. They must be ropes that have never been used. Then I’ll become as weak as any other man.”"
Judges,16,12,"So Delilah got some new ropes. She tied him up with them. Men were hiding in the room. She called out to him, “Samson! The Philistines are attacking you!” But he snapped the ropes off his arms. They fell off just as if they were threads."
Judges,16,13,"Delilah spoke to Samson again. “All this time you have been making me look foolish,” she said. “You have been telling me lies. This time really tell me how you can be tied up.” He replied, “Weave the seven braids of my hair into the cloth on a loom. Then tighten the cloth with a pin. If you do, I’ll become as weak as any other man.” So while Samson was sleeping, Delilah took hold of the seven braids of his hair. She wove them into the cloth on a loom."
Judges,16,14,"Then she tightened the cloth with a pin. Again she called out to him, “Samson! The Philistines are attacking you!” He woke up from his sleep. He pulled up the pin and the loom, together with the cloth."
Judges,16,15,"Then she said to him, “How can you say, ‘I love you’? You won’t even share your secret with me. This is the third time you have made me look foolish. And you still haven’t told me the secret of why you are so strong.”"
Judges,16,16,She continued to pester him day after day. She nagged him until he was sick and tired of it.
Judges,16,17,"So he told her everything. He said, “My hair has never been cut. That’s because I’ve been a Nazirite since the day I was born. A Nazirite is set apart to God. If you shave my head, I won’t be strong anymore. I’ll become as weak as any other man.”"
Judges,16,18,"Delilah realized he had told her everything. So she sent a message to the Philistine rulers. She said, “Come back one more time. He has told me everything.” So the rulers returned. They brought the silver with them."
Judges,16,19,Delilah got Samson to go to sleep on her lap. Then she called for someone to shave off the seven braids of his hair. That’s how she began to bring Samson under her control. And he wasn’t strong anymore.
Judges,16,20,"She called out, “Samson! The Philistines are attacking you!” He woke up from his sleep. He thought, “I’ll go out just as I did before. I’ll shake myself free.” But he didn’t know that the Lord had left him."
Judges,16,21,Then the Philistines grabbed him. They poked his eyes out. They took him down to Gaza. They put bronze chains around him. Then they made him grind grain in the prison.
Judges,16,22,His head had been shaved. But the hair on it began to grow again.
Judges,16,23,"The rulers of the Philistines gathered together. They were going to offer a great sacrifice to their god Dagon. They were going to celebrate. They said, “Our god has handed our enemy Samson over to us.”"
Judges,16,24,"When the people saw Samson, they praised their god. They said, “Our god has handed our enemy over to us. Our enemy has destroyed our land. He has killed large numbers of our people.”"
Judges,16,25,"After they had drunk a lot of wine, they shouted, “Bring Samson out. Let him put on a show for us.” So they called Samson out of the prison. He put on a show for them. They had him stand near the temple pillars."
Judges,16,26,"Then he spoke to the servant who was holding his hand. He said, “Put me where I can feel the pillars. I’m talking about the ones that hold up the temple. I want to lean against them.”"
Judges,16,27,"The temple was crowded with men and women. All the Philistine rulers were there. About 3,000 men and women were on the roof. They were watching Samson put on a show."
Judges,16,28,"Then he prayed to the Lord . Samson said, “ Lord and King, show me that you still have concern for me. Please, God, make me strong just one more time. Let me pay the Philistines back for what they did to my two eyes. Let me do it with only one blow.”"
Judges,16,29,Then Samson reached toward the two pillars that were in the middle of the temple. They were the ones that held up the temple. He put his right hand on one of them. He put his left hand on the other. He leaned hard against them.
Judges,16,30,"Samson said, “Let me die together with the Philistines!” Then he pushed with all his might. The temple came down on the rulers. It fell on all the people in it. So Samson killed many more Philistines when he died than he did while he lived."
Judges,16,31,Then his brothers went down to get him. So did his father’s whole family. All of them brought Samson back home. They buried him in the tomb of his father Manoah. It’s between Zorah and Eshtaol. Samson had led Israel for 20 years.
Judges,17,1,A man named Micah lived in the hill country of Ephraim.
Judges,17,2,"He said to his mother, “Someone took 28 pounds of silver from you. I heard you curse the one who took it. I have the silver with me. I’m the one who took it.” Then his mother said, “My son, may the Lord bless you!”"
Judges,17,3,"He gave the 28 pounds of silver back to his mother. She said to him, “I’m making a promise to set apart my silver to the Lord . My son, I want you to use it to cover a statue of a god made out of wood or stone. That’s why I’ll give the silver back to you.”"
Judges,17,4,Micah gave the silver back to his mother. Then she gave five pounds of it to a skilled worker who made things out of silver. He used the silver for the statue. The statue was put in Micah’s house.
Judges,17,5,That same Micah had a small temple. He made a sacred linen apron and some statues of his family gods. He appointed one of his sons to serve as his priest.
Judges,17,6,In those days Israel didn’t have a king. The people did anything they thought was right.
Judges,17,7,A young Levite had been living in land that belonged to the tribe of Judah. He was from Bethlehem in Judah.
Judges,17,8,He left that town to look for some other place to stay. On his way he came to Micah’s house. It was in the hill country of Ephraim.
Judges,17,9,"Micah asked him, “Where are you from?” “I’m a Levite,” he said. “I’m from Bethlehem in Judah. I’m looking for a place to stay.”"
Judges,17,10,"Then Micah said to him, “Live with me. Be my father and priest. I’ll give you four ounces of silver a year. I’ll also give you clothes and food.”"
Judges,17,11,So the Levite agreed to live with him. The young man became just like one of Micah’s sons to him.
Judges,17,12,Then Micah appointed the Levite to serve as his priest. He lived in Micah’s house.
Judges,17,13,"Micah said, “Now I know that the Lord will be good to me. This Levite has become my priest.”"
Judges,18,1,In those days Israel didn’t have a king. And in those days the tribe of Dan was looking for a place where they could make their homes. They hadn’t been able to take over their own share of land among the tribes of Israel.
Judges,18,2,"So the people of Dan sent out five of their leading men from Zorah and Eshtaol. They told the men to look over the land and check it out. Those men did it for all the people of Dan. Those people told the men, “Go. Check out the land.” So they entered the hill country of Ephraim. They went to the house of Micah. That’s where they spent the night."
Judges,18,3,"When they came near Micah’s house, they recognized a voice. It was the voice of the young Levite. So they turned off the road and stopped there. They asked him, “Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? Why are you here?”"
Judges,18,4,"The Levite told them what Micah had done for him. He said, “He has hired me. I’m his priest.”"
Judges,18,5,"Then they said to him, “Please ask God for advice. Try to find out whether we’ll have success on our journey.”"
Judges,18,6,"The priest answered them, “Go in peace. The Lord is pleased with your journey.”"
Judges,18,7,"So the five men left. They came to Laish. There they saw that the people felt secure. They were living in safety. Like the people in Sidon, they were at peace. Their land had everything they needed. Things were going very well for them. They lived a long way from the people of Sidon. And they didn’t think they would ever need help from anyone else."
Judges,18,8,"The men returned to Zorah and Eshtaol. Their people asked them, “What did you find out?”"
Judges,18,9,"They answered, “Come on! Let’s attack them! We’ve seen the land, and it is very good. Aren’t you going to do something? Don’t wait any longer. Go there and take it over."
Judges,18,10,"When you get there, you will find people who aren’t expecting anything bad to happen to them. Their land has plenty of room. God has handed it over to you. It’s a land that has everything you will ever need.”"
Judges,18,11,So 600 men from the tribe of Dan started out from Zorah and Eshtaol. They were prepared for battle.
Judges,18,12,On their way they set up camp. Their camp was near Kiriath Jearim in Judah. That’s why the place is called Mahaneh Dan to this day. It’s west of Kiriath Jearim.
Judges,18,13,From there they went to the hill country of Ephraim. They came to Micah’s house.
Judges,18,14,"Then the five men who had looked over the land of Laish spoke to the other members of their tribe. They said, “Don’t you know that one of these houses has a sacred linen apron in it? Some statues of family gods are there. That house also has another statue of a god covered with silver. Now you know what to do.”"
Judges,18,15,So they turned off the road and stopped there. They went to the house of the young Levite. He was at Micah’s place. They greeted the young man.
Judges,18,16,The 600 men from Dan stood at the entrance of the gate. They were prepared for battle.
Judges,18,17,"The five men who had looked over the land went inside. They took the statue covered with silver. They also took the family gods and the linen apron. During that time, the priest stood at the entrance of the gate. The 600 men stood there with him. They were prepared for battle."
Judges,18,18,"When the five men went into Micah’s house and took all those things, the priest spoke to them. He asked, “What are you doing?”"
Judges,18,19,"They answered him, “Be quiet! Don’t say a word. Come with us. Be our father and priest. You can serve a whole tribe and family group in Israel as our priest. Isn’t that better than serving just one man’s family?”"
Judges,18,20,The priest was very pleased. He took the linen apron and the family gods. He also took the statue of the god that was covered with silver. Then the priest left with the people.
Judges,18,21,They put their little children and their livestock in front of them. They also put everything else they owned in front of them. And they turned and went on their way.
Judges,18,22,The men who lived near Micah were called together. Then they left and caught up with the people of Dan. That’s because Dan’s people hadn’t gone very far from Micah’s house.
Judges,18,23,"Those who lived near Micah shouted at them. The people of Dan turned around and asked Micah, “What’s the matter with you? Why did you call out your men to fight against us?”"
Judges,18,24,"He replied, “You took away the gods I made. And you took away my priest. What do I have left? So how can you ask, ‘What’s the matter with you?’ ”"
Judges,18,25,"The people of Dan answered, “Don’t argue with us. Some of the men may get angry and attack you. Then you and your family will lose your lives.”"
Judges,18,26,So the people of Dan went on their way. Micah saw that they were too strong for him. So he turned around and went back home.
Judges,18,27,The people of Dan took what Micah had made. They also took his priest. They continued on their way to Laish. They went there to fight against a people who were at peace and secure. The people of Dan struck them down with their swords. They burned down their city.
Judges,18,28,No one could save those people and their city. They lived a long way from Sidon. And they didn’t think they would ever need help from anyone else. Their city was located in a valley near Beth Rehob. The people of Dan rebuilt the city. Then they made their homes there.
Judges,18,29,They named it Dan. That’s because they traced their family line back to Dan. He was a son of Israel. The city used to be called Laish.
Judges,18,30,"There the people of Dan set up for themselves the statue of the god that was covered with silver. Jonathan and his sons were priests for the tribe of Dan. Jonathan was the son of Gershom, the son of Moses. Jonathan and his sons were priests until the time when the land was captured."
Judges,18,31,The people of Dan continued to use the statue Micah had made. They used it during the whole time the house of God was in Shiloh.
Judges,19,1,In those days Israel didn’t have a king. There was a Levite who lived deep in the hill country of Ephraim. He got a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah.
Judges,19,2,But she wasn’t faithful to him. She left him. She went back to her parents’ home in Bethlehem in Judah. She stayed there for four months.
Judges,19,3,"Then her husband went to see her. He tried to talk her into coming back with him. He had his servant and two donkeys with him. She took her husband into her parents’ home. When her father saw him, he gladly welcomed him."
Judges,19,4,"His father-in-law, the woman’s father, begged him to stay. So the Levite remained with him for three days. He ate, drank and slept there."
Judges,19,5,"On the fourth day they got up early. The Levite prepared to leave. But the woman’s father said to his son-in-law, “Have something to eat. It will give you strength. Then you can go on your way.”"
Judges,19,6,"So the two of them sat down. They ate and drank together. After that, the woman’s father said, “Please stay tonight. Enjoy yourself.”"
Judges,19,7,The man got up to go. But his father-in-law talked him into staying. So he stayed there that night.
Judges,19,8,"On the morning of the fifth day, the Levite got up to go. But the woman’s father said, “Have something to eat. It will give you strength. Wait until this afternoon!” So the two of them ate together."
Judges,19,9,"Then the man got up to leave. His concubine and his servant got up when he did. But his father-in-law, the woman’s father, spoke to him again. “Look,” he said. “It’s almost evening. The day is nearly over. So spend another night here. Please stay. Enjoy yourself. Early tomorrow morning you can get up and go back home.”"
Judges,19,10,But the man didn’t want to stay another night. So he left. He went toward Jebus. Jebus is also called Jerusalem. The Levite had his two donkeys and his concubine with him. The donkeys had saddles on them.
Judges,19,11,"By the time the travelers came near Jebus, the day was almost over. So the servant said to his master, “Come. Let’s stop at this Jebusite city. Let’s spend the night here.”"
Judges,19,12,"His master replied, “No. We won’t go into any city where strangers live. The people there aren’t Israelites. We’ll continue on to Gibeah.”"
Judges,19,13,"He added, “Come. Let’s try to reach Gibeah or Ramah. We can spend the night in one of those places.”"
Judges,19,14,"So they continued on. As they came near Gibeah in Benjamin, the sun went down."
Judges,19,15,They stopped there to spend the night. They went to the city’s main street and sat down. But no one took them home for the night.
Judges,19,16,That evening an old man came into the city. He had been working in the fields. He was from the hill country of Ephraim. But he was living in Gibeah. The people who lived there were from the tribe of Benjamin.
Judges,19,17,"The old man saw the traveler in the main street. He asked, “Where are you going? Where did you come from?”"
Judges,19,18,"The Levite answered, “We’ve come from Bethlehem in Judah. We’re on our way to Ephraim. I live deep in the hill country there. I’ve been to Bethlehem. Now I’m going to the house of the Lord . But no one has taken me home for the night."
Judges,19,19,"We have straw and feed for our donkeys. We have food and wine for ourselves. We have enough for me, the woman and the young man with us. We don’t need anything.”"
Judges,19,20,"“You are welcome at my house,” the old man said. “I’d be happy to supply anything you might need. But don’t spend the night in the street.”"
Judges,19,21,"So the old man took him into his house and fed his donkeys. After the travelers had washed their feet, they had something to eat and drink."
Judges,19,22,"They were inside enjoying themselves. But some of the evil men who lived in the city surrounded the house. They pounded on the door. They shouted to the old man who owned the house. They said, “Bring out the man who came to your house. We want to have sex with him.”"
Judges,19,23,"The owner of the house went outside. He said to them, “No, my friends. Don’t do such an evil thing. This man is my guest. So don’t do this terrible thing."
Judges,19,24,"Look, here is my virgin daughter. And here’s the Levite’s concubine. I’ll bring them out to you now. You can have them. Do to them what you want to. But don’t do such a terrible thing to this man.”"
Judges,19,25,"The men wouldn’t listen to him. So the Levite sent his concubine out to them. They forced her to have sex with them. They raped her all night long. As the night was ending, they let her go."
Judges,19,26,At sunrise she went back to the house where her master was staying. She fell down at the door. She stayed there until daylight.
Judges,19,27,Later that morning her master got up. He opened the door of the house. He stepped out to continue on his way. But his concubine was lying there. She had fallen at the doorway of the house. Her hands were reaching out toward the door.
Judges,19,28,"He said to her, “Get up. Let’s go.” But there wasn’t any answer. Then he put her dead body on his donkey. And he started out for home."
Judges,19,29,"When he reached home, he got a knife. He cut up his concubine. He cut her into 12 pieces. He sent them into all the territories of Israel."
Judges,19,30,"Everyone who saw it spoke to one another. They said, “Nothing like this has ever been seen or done before. Nothing like this has happened since the day the Israelites came up out of Egypt. Just imagine! We must do something! So let’s hear your ideas!”"
Judges,20,1,Then all the Israelites came out. They came from the whole land between Dan and Beersheba. They also came from the land of Gilead. All of them gathered together in front of the Lord at Mizpah.
Judges,20,2,"The leaders of all the tribes of Israel came. They took their places among the people of God gathered together. There were 400,000 men carrying swords."
Judges,20,3,"The tribe of Benjamin heard that the Israelites had gone up to Mizpah. The Israelites said, “Tell us how this awful thing happened.”"
Judges,20,4,"So the Levite spoke. He was the husband of the woman who had been murdered. He said, “I and my concubine went to Gibeah in Benjamin. We spent the night there."
Judges,20,5,"During the night the men of Gibeah came after me. They surrounded the house. They were planning to kill me. They raped my concubine, and she died."
Judges,20,6,I took my concubine and cut her into pieces. I sent one piece to each part of Israel’s territory. I did it because the men of Gibeah had done a very terrible thing in Israel.
Judges,20,7,"All you men of Israel, speak up now. Tell me what you have decided to do.”"
Judges,20,8,"All the men got up together. They said, “None of us will go home. Not one of us will return to his house."
Judges,20,9,Here is what we’ll do to Gibeah. We’ll cast lots to tell us how to attack the city.
Judges,20,10,"We’ll take ten men out of every 100 from all the tribes of Israel. We’ll take 100 from every 1,000. We’ll take 1,000 from every 10,000. The men we take will get supplies for the army. Then the army will go to Gibeah in Benjamin. They’ll give Gibeah exactly what they should get because of the terrible thing they did in Israel.”"
Judges,20,11,So all the men of Israel came together to fight against the city.
Judges,20,12,"The tribes of Israel sent people to carry a message through the whole tribe of Benjamin. They said, “What about this awful crime that was committed among you?"
Judges,20,13,Hand over to us those evil men of Gibeah. We’ll put them to death. In that way we’ll get rid of those evil people.” But the people of Benjamin wouldn’t listen to the other Israelites.
Judges,20,14,They came together at Gibeah from their towns. They came to fight against the other Israelites.
Judges,20,15,"Right away the people of Benjamin gathered together 26,000 men from their towns. They were carrying swords. These men were added to the 700 capable young men from Gibeah."
Judges,20,16,Among all these men there were 700 who were left-handed. Each of them could sling a stone at a hair and not miss.
Judges,20,17,"Israel gathered 400,000 men together. They were carrying swords. All of them were trained for battle. That number didn’t include the tribe of Benjamin."
Judges,20,18,"The Israelites went up to Bethel. There they asked God, “Who should go up first and fight against the people of Benjamin?” The Lord answered, “The tribe of Judah will go first.”"
Judges,20,19,The next morning the Israelites got up. They set up camp near Gibeah.
Judges,20,20,The Israelites went out to fight against the men of Benjamin. They took up their battle positions against them at Gibeah.
Judges,20,21,"The men of Benjamin came out of Gibeah. They killed 22,000 Israelites on the field of battle that day."
Judges,20,22,But the Israelites cheered one another on. They again took up their positions in the places where they had been the first day.
Judges,20,23,"The Israelites went and wept in front of the Lord until evening. They asked the Lord , “Should we go up again to fight against the men of Benjamin? They are our fellow Israelites.” The Lord answered, “Go up and fight against them.”"
Judges,20,24,The Israelites came near the men of Benjamin on the second day.
Judges,20,25,"The men of Benjamin came out from Gibeah to oppose them. That time they killed 18,000 more Israelites. All the men who died had been carrying swords."
Judges,20,26,"Then all the Israelites, the whole army, went up to Bethel. They sat there and wept in front of the Lord . They didn’t eat anything that day until evening. Then they brought burnt offerings and friendship offerings to the Lord."
Judges,20,27,Again the Israelites spoke to the Lord . In those days the ark of the covenant of God was there.
Judges,20,28,"Phinehas was serving as priest at the ark. He was the son of Eleazar. Eleazar was the son of Aaron. The Israelites asked, “Should we go up again to fight against the men of Benjamin? They are our fellow Israelites.” The Lord answered, “Go. Tomorrow I will hand them over to you.”"
Judges,20,29,Then Israel hid some men and had them wait all around Gibeah.
Judges,20,30,"They went up to fight against the men of Benjamin on the third day. They took up their positions against Gibeah, just as they had done before."
Judges,20,31,The men of Benjamin came out to fight against them. They were drawn away from the city. They began to wound and kill the Israelites just as they had done before. About 30 men fell in battle. They fell in the open fields and on the roads. One of the roads led to Bethel. The other led to Gibeah.
Judges,20,32,"The men of Benjamin said, “We’re winning the battle over them, just as we did before.” But the men of Israel said, “Let’s pull back. Let’s draw them away from the city to the roads.”"
Judges,20,33,All the men of Israel moved away from their places. They took up new battle positions at Baal Tamar. The men who had been hiding charged out. They came from west of Gibeah.
Judges,20,34,"Then 10,000 of Israel’s capable young men attacked Gibeah. The men of Benjamin didn’t realize they were about to be destroyed. The fighting was very heavy."
Judges,20,35,"The Lord helped Israel win the battle over Benjamin. On that day the Israelites struck down 25,100 men of Benjamin. All the men who died had been carrying swords."
Judges,20,36,Then the men of Benjamin saw that they had lost the battle. The men of Israel had moved away from their positions in front of Benjamin. They had depended on the men they had hidden near Gibeah.
Judges,20,37,Suddenly those men who had been hiding rushed into Gibeah. They spread out. Then they killed everyone in the city with their swords.
Judges,20,38,The Israelites had made a plan with those who had been hiding. They had told them to send up a large cloud of smoke from the city.
Judges,20,39,"Then the Israelites would turn around and attack. The men of Benjamin had begun to wound and kill the men of Israel. They had struck down about 30 of them. They had said, “We’re winning the battle over them, just as we did the first time.”"
Judges,20,40,But a large cloud of smoke began to go up from the city. The men of Benjamin turned around. They saw the whole city going up in smoke.
Judges,20,41,Then the Israelites turned around and attacked them. The men of Benjamin were terrified. They realized they were going to be destroyed.
Judges,20,42,So they ran away from the men of Israel. They ran toward the desert. But they couldn’t escape the battle. Other Israelites came out of the towns. There they struck down the men of Benjamin.
Judges,20,43,Here’s how it happened. The Israelites had surrounded them. They had chased them and easily caught up with them east of Gibeah.
Judges,20,44,"So 18,000 men of Benjamin fell in battle. All of them were brave fighters."
Judges,20,45,"Some men of Benjamin turned back. They ran toward the desert to the rock of Rimmon. As they did, the Israelites struck down 5,000 of them along the roads. They kept chasing the men of Benjamin all the way to Gidom. Along the way they struck down 2,000 more."
Judges,20,46,"On that day 25,000 men of Benjamin fell in battle. They had been carrying swords. All of them were brave fighters."
Judges,20,47,But 600 of them turned back. They ran into the desert to the rock of Rimmon. They stayed there for four months.
Judges,20,48,The men of Israel went back to Benjamin. In all the towns they killed the people with their swords. They even killed the animals. So they killed everything they found. They set on fire all the towns they came to.
Judges,21,1,"The men of Israel had made a promise at Mizpah. They had said, “Not one of us will give his daughter to be married to a man from Benjamin.”"
Judges,21,2,The people went to Bethel. They sat there until evening in front of God. They wept loudly and bitterly.
Judges,21,3,"“ Lord , you are the God of Israel,” they cried. “Why has this happened to Israel? Why is one tribe missing from Israel today?”"
Judges,21,4,Early the next day the people built an altar. They brought burnt offerings and friendship offerings.
Judges,21,5,"Then the Israelites asked, “Has anyone failed to come here in front of the Lord ? Is anyone missing from all the tribes of Israel?” The people had made a promise. They had said that anyone who failed to come to Mizpah in front of the Lord must be put to death."
Judges,21,6,"The Israelites were very sad because of what had happened to the tribe of Benjamin. After all, they were their fellow Israelites. “Today one tribe has been cut off from Israel,” they said."
Judges,21,7,“How can we provide wives for the men who are left? We’ve made a promise in front of the Lord . We’ve promised not to give any of our daughters to be married to them.”
Judges,21,8,"Then they asked, “Has any tribe of Israel failed to come here to Mizpah in front of the Lord ?” They discovered that no one from Jabesh Gilead had come. No one from there had gathered together with the others in the camp."
Judges,21,9,They counted the people. They found that none of the people of Jabesh Gilead had come to Mizpah.
Judges,21,10,"So the community sent 12,000 fighting men to Jabesh Gilead. They directed them to take their swords and kill those living there. That included the women and children."
Judges,21,11,"“Here is what you must do,” they said. “Kill every male. Also kill every woman who is not a virgin.”"
Judges,21,12,They found 400 young women in Jabesh Gilead who had never slept with a man. So they took them to the camp at Shiloh in Canaan.
Judges,21,13,Then the whole community sent an offer of peace to the men of Benjamin. The men were at the rock of Rimmon.
Judges,21,14,So the men of Benjamin returned at that time. They were given the women of Jabesh Gilead who had been spared. But there weren’t enough women for all of them.
Judges,21,15,The people were very sad because of what had happened to the tribe of Benjamin. The Lord had left a gap in the tribes of Israel. They weren’t complete without Benjamin.
Judges,21,16,"The elders of the community spoke up. They said, “All the women of Benjamin have been wiped out. So how will we find wives for the men who are left?"
Judges,21,17,"The men of Benjamin who are still alive need to have children,” they said. “If they don’t, a tribe of Israel will be wiped out."
Judges,21,18,"But we can’t give them our daughters to be their wives. We Israelites have made a promise. We’ve said, ‘May anyone who gives a wife to a man from Benjamin be under the Lord ’s curse.’"
Judges,21,19,"Look, a feast is celebrated every year in Shiloh to honor the Lord . Shiloh is north of Bethel. It’s east of the road that goes from Bethel to Shechem. It’s south of Lebonah.”"
Judges,21,20,"So they told the men of Benjamin what to do. They said, “Go. Hide in the vineyards"
Judges,21,21,"and watch. The young women of Shiloh will come out. They’ll join in the dancing. When they do, run out of the vineyards. Each of you grab a young woman from Shiloh to be your wife. Then return to the land of Benjamin."
Judges,21,22,"Their fathers or brothers might not be happy with what we’re doing. If they aren’t, we’ll say to them, ‘Do us a favor. Help the men of Benjamin. We didn’t get wives for them during the battle. You aren’t guilty of doing anything wrong. After all, you didn’t give your daughters to them. Your daughters were stolen from you.’ ”"
Judges,21,23,"So that’s what the men of Benjamin did. While the young women were dancing, each man caught one. He carried her away to be his wife. Then the men returned to their own share of land. They built the towns again. They made their homes in them."
Judges,21,24,At that time the Israelites also left. They went home to their tribes and family groups. Each one went to his own share of land.
Judges,21,25,In those days Israel didn’t have a king. The people did anything they thought was right.
