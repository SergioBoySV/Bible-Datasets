Amos,1,1,"These are the words of Amos. He was a shepherd from the town of Tekoa. Here is the vision he saw concerning Israel. It came to him two years before the earthquake. At that time Uzziah was king of Judah. Jeroboam, the son of Jehoash, was king of Israel. Here are the words of Amos."
Amos,1,2,"He said, “The Lord roars like a lion from Jerusalem. His voice sounds like thunder from Zion. The grasslands of the shepherds turn brown. The top of Mount Carmel dries up.”"
Amos,1,3,"The Lord says, “The people of Damascus have sinned again and again. So I will judge them. They used threshing sleds with iron teeth to crush Gilead’s people."
Amos,1,4,So I will send fire to destroy the palace of King Hazael. It will burn up the forts of his son Ben-Hadad.
Amos,1,5,"I will break down the city gate of Damascus. I will kill the king who lives in the Valley of Aven, that evil place. He holds the ruler’s scepter in Beth Eden. The people of Aram will be taken away to Kir as prisoners,” says the Lord."
Amos,1,6,"The Lord says, “The people of Gaza have sinned again and again. So I will judge them. They captured whole communities. They sold them to Edom."
Amos,1,7,So I will send fire to destroy the walls of Gaza. It will burn up its forts.
Amos,1,8,"I will kill the king of Ashdod. He holds the ruler’s scepter in Ashkelon. I will use my power against Ekron. Every single Philistine will die,” says the Lord and King."
Amos,1,9,"The Lord says, “The people of Tyre have sinned again and again. So I will judge them. They captured whole communities. They sold them to Edom. They did not honor the treaty of friendship they had made."
Amos,1,10,So I will send fire to destroy the walls of Tyre. It will burn up its forts.”
Amos,1,11,"The Lord says, “The people of Edom have sinned again and again. So I will judge them. They chased Israel with swords that were ready to strike them down. They killed the women of the land. They were angry all the time. Their anger was like a fire that blazed out. It could not be stopped."
Amos,1,12,So I will send fire to destroy the city of Teman. It will burn up Bozrah’s forts.”
Amos,1,13,"The Lord says, “The people of Ammon have sinned again and again. So I will judge them. They ripped open the pregnant women in Gilead. They wanted to add land to their territory."
Amos,1,14,So I will set fire to destroy the walls of Rabbah. It will burn up its forts. War cries will be heard on that day of battle. Strong winds will blow on that stormy day.
Amos,1,15,"Ammon’s king will be carried away. So will his officials,” says the Lord."
Amos,2,1,"The Lord says, “The people of Moab have sinned again and again. So I will judge them. They burned the bones of Edom’s king to ashes."
Amos,2,2,So I will send fire to destroy Moab. It will burn up Kerioth’s forts. Moab will come crashing down with a loud noise. War cries will be heard. So will the blast of trumpets.
Amos,2,3,"I will kill Moab’s ruler. I will also kill all its officials,” says the Lord."
Amos,2,4,"The Lord says, “The people of Judah have sinned again and again. So I will judge them. They have refused to obey my law. They have not kept my rules. Other gods have led them astray. Their people of long ago worshiped those gods."
Amos,2,5,So I will send fire to destroy Judah. It will burn up Jerusalem’s forts.”
Amos,2,6,"The Lord says, “The people of Israel have sinned again and again. So I will judge them. They sell into slavery those who have done no wrong. They trade needy people for a mere pair of sandals."
Amos,2,7,They grind the heads of the poor into the dust of the ground. They refuse to be fair to those who are crushed. A father and his son have sex with the same girl. They treat my name as if it were not holy.
Amos,2,8,They lie down beside every altar on clothes they have taken. They lie on those clothes until the owner pays back what is owed. In the house of their God they drink wine that was paid as fines.
Amos,2,9,“Yet I destroyed the Amorites to make room in the land for my people. The Amorites were as tall as cedar trees. They were as strong as oak trees. But I cut off their fruit above the ground and their roots below it.
Amos,2,10,"“People of Israel, I brought you up out of Egypt. I led you in the desert for 40 years. I gave you the land of the Amorites."
Amos,2,11,"I raised up prophets from among your children. I also set apart for myself some of your young people to be Nazirites. Isn’t that true, people of Israel?” announces the Lord."
Amos,2,12,“But you made the Nazirites drink wine. You commanded the prophets not to prophesy.
Amos,2,13,"“A cart that is loaded with grain crushes anything it runs over. In the same way, I will crush you."
Amos,2,14,Your fastest runners will not escape. The strongest people will not get away. Even soldiers will not be able to save their own lives.
Amos,2,15,Men who are armed with bows will lose the battle. Soldiers who are quick on their feet will not escape. Horsemen will not be able to save their own lives.
Amos,2,16,"Even your bravest soldiers will run away naked on that day,” announces the Lord."
Amos,3,1,"People of Israel, listen to the Lord ’s message. He has spoken his message against you. He has spoken it against the whole family he brought up out of Egypt. He says,"
Amos,3,2,“Out of all the families on earth I have chosen only you. So I will punish you because you have committed so many sins.”
Amos,3,3,Do two people walk together unless they’ve agreed to do so?
Amos,3,4,Does a lion roar in the bushes when it doesn’t have any food? Does it growl in its den when it hasn’t caught anything?
Amos,3,5,Does a bird fly down to a trap on the ground when no bait is there? Does a net spring up from the ground when it has not caught anything?
Amos,3,6,"When someone blows a trumpet in a city, don’t the people tremble with fear? When trouble comes to a city, hasn’t the Lord caused it?"
Amos,3,7,The Lord and King never does anything without telling his servants the prophets about it.
Amos,3,8,A lion has roared. Who isn’t afraid? The Lord and King has spoken. Who can do anything but prophesy?
Amos,3,9,"Speak to the people in the forts of Ashdod and Egypt. Tell them, “Gather together on the mountains of Samaria. Look at the great trouble in that city. Its people are committing many crimes.”"
Amos,3,10,"“They do not know how to do what is right,” announces the Lord. “They store up stolen goods in their forts.”"
Amos,3,11,"So the Lord and King says, “Enemies will take over your land. They will pull down your places of safety. They will rob your forts.”"
Amos,3,12,"The Lord says, “Suppose a shepherd saves only two leg bones from a lion’s mouth. Or he might save only a piece of an ear. That is how the Israelites living in Samaria will be saved. They will only have a board from a bed and a piece of cloth from a couch.”"
Amos,3,13,"“Listen to me,” announces the Lord. “Be a witness against the people of Jacob,” says the Lord God who rules over all."
Amos,3,14,"“I will punish Israel for their sins. When I do, I will destroy their altars at Bethel. The horns that stick out from the upper corners of their main altar will be cut off. They will fall to the ground."
Amos,3,15,"I will tear down their winter houses. I will also pull down their summer houses. The houses they have decorated with ivory will be destroyed. And their princely houses will be torn down,” announces the Lord."
Amos,4,1,"Listen to the Lord ’s message, you women who live on the hill of Samaria. You treat poor people badly. You crush those who are in need. You say to your husbands, “Bring us some drinks!” But you are already as fat as the cows in Bashan."
Amos,4,2,"The Lord and King has made a promise by his own holy name. He says, “You can be sure that the time will come when your enemies will put hooks in your faces. They will lead every one of you away with fishhooks."
Amos,4,3,"Each of you will go straight out through gaps made in the wall. You will be thrown out toward Harmon,” announces the Lord."
Amos,4,4,"“People of Samaria, go to Bethel and sin! Go to Gilgal! Sin there even more! Bring your sacrifices every morning. Every third year, bring a tenth of everything you produce."
Amos,4,5,"Bake some bread with yeast. Burn it as a thank offering. Brag about the offerings you freely give. This is what you Israelites love to do,” announces the Lord and King."
Amos,4,6,"“I made sure your stomachs were empty in every city. You did not have enough bread in any of your towns. In spite of that, you still have not returned to me,” announces the Lord."
Amos,4,7,“I also held back rain from you. The time to harvest crops was still three months away. I sent rain on one town. But I held it back from another. One field had rain. But another had no rain and dried up.
Amos,4,8,"People wandered from town to town to look for water. But they did not get enough to drink. In spite of that, you still have not returned to me,” announces the Lord."
Amos,4,9,"“Many times I kept your gardens and vineyards from growing. I sent hot winds to dry them up completely. Locusts ate up your fig and olive trees. In spite of that, you still have not returned to me,” announces the Lord."
Amos,4,10,"“I sent plagues on you, just as I did on Egypt. I killed your young men by swords. I also let the horses you had captured be killed. I filled your noses with the stink of your camps. In spite of that, you still have not returned to me,” announces the Lord."
Amos,4,11,"“I destroyed some of you, just as I did Sodom and Gomorrah. You were like a burning stick that was pulled out of the fire. In spite of that, you still have not returned to me,” announces the Lord."
Amos,4,12,"“So, people of Israel, I will judge you. Because I will do that to you, Israel, prepare to meet your God!”"
Amos,4,13,The Lord forms the mountains. He creates the wind. He makes his thoughts known to human beings. He turns sunrise into darkness. He rules over even the highest places on earth. His name is the Lord God Who Rules Over All.
Amos,5,1,"People of Israel, listen to the Lord ’s message. Hear my song of sadness about you. I say,"
Amos,5,2,“The people of Israel have fallen. They will never get up again. They are deserted in their own land. No one can lift them up.”
Amos,5,3,Here is what the Lord and King says to Israel. “A thousand soldiers will march out from a city. But only a hundred will return. A hundred soldiers will march out from a town. But only ten will come back.”
Amos,5,4,"The Lord speaks to the people of Israel. He says, “Look to me and live."
Amos,5,5,Do not look to Bethel. Do not go to Gilgal. Do not travel to Beersheba. The people of Gilgal will be taken away as prisoners. Nothing will be left of Bethel.”
Amos,5,6,"Israel, look to the Lord and live. If you don’t, he will sweep through the tribes of Joseph like a fire. It will burn everything up. And Bethel won’t have anyone to put it out."
Amos,5,7,There are people among you who turn what is fair into something bitter. They throw down to the ground what is right.
Amos,5,8,The Lord made the Pleiades and Orion. He turns midnight into sunrise. He makes the day fade into night. He sends for the waters in the clouds. Then he pours them out on the surface of the land. His name is the Lord.
Amos,5,9,With a flash of light he destroys places of safety. He tears down cities that have high walls around them.
Amos,5,10,There are people among you who hate anyone who stands for justice in court. They hate those who tell the truth.
Amos,5,11,"You make poor people pay tax on their straw. You also tax their grain. So, even though you have built stone houses, you won’t live in them. You have planted fruitful vineyards. But you won’t drink the wine they produce."
Amos,5,12,I know how many crimes you have committed. You have sinned far too much. Among you are people who crush those who have done no wrong. They accept money from people who want special favors. They take away the rights of poor people in the courts.
Amos,5,13,So those who are wise keep quiet in times like these. That’s because the times are evil.
Amos,5,14,"Look to what is good, not to what is evil. Then you will live. And the Lord God who rules over all will be with you, just as you say he is."
Amos,5,15,"Hate evil and love good. Do what is fair in the courts. Perhaps the Lord God who rules over all will have mercy on you. After all, you are the only ones left in the family line of Joseph."
Amos,5,16,"The Lord God rules over all. The Lord says, “People will weep in all the streets. They will be very sad in every market place. Even farmers will be told to cry loudly. People will mourn for the dead."
Amos,5,17,"Workers will cry in all the vineyards. That’s because I will punish you,” says the Lord."
Amos,5,18,"How terrible it will be for you who long for the day of the Lord! Why do you want it to come? That day will be dark, not light."
Amos,5,19,It will be like a man running away from a lion only to meet a bear. He enters his house and rests his hand on a wall only to be bitten by a snake.
Amos,5,20,"The day of the Lord will be dark, not light. It will be very black. There won’t be a ray of sunlight anywhere."
Amos,5,21,"The Lord says, “I hate your holy feasts. I can’t stand them. Your gatherings stink."
Amos,5,22,You bring me burnt offerings and grain offerings. But I will not accept them. You bring your best friendship offerings. But I will not even look at them.
Amos,5,23,Take the noise of your songs away! I will not listen to the music of your harps.
Amos,5,24,I want you to treat others fairly. So let fair treatment roll on just as a river does! Always do what is right. Let right living flow along like a stream that never runs dry!
Amos,5,25,"“People of Israel, did you bring me sacrifices and offerings for 40 years in the desert?"
Amos,5,26,Yes. But you have honored the place where your king worshiped other gods. You have carried the stands the statues of your gods were on. You have lifted up the banners of the stars you worship as gods. You made all those things for yourselves.
Amos,5,27,"So I will send you away as prisoners beyond Damascus,” says the Lord. His name is God Who Rules Over All."
Amos,6,1,How terrible it will be for you men who are so contented on Mount Zion! How terrible for you who feel secure on the hill of Samaria! You are famous men from the greatest nation. The people of Israel come to you for help and advice.
Amos,6,2,Go and look at the city of Kalneh. Go from there to the great city of Hamath. Then go down to Gath in Philistia. Are those places better off than your two kingdoms? Is their land larger than yours?
Amos,6,3,You are trying to avoid the time when trouble will come. But you are only bringing closer the Assyrian rule of terror.
Amos,6,4,You lie down on beds that are decorated with ivory. You rest on your couches. You eat the best lambs and the fattest calves.
Amos,6,5,You pluck away on your harps as David did. You play new songs on musical instruments.
Amos,6,6,You drink wine by the bowlful. You use the finest lotions. But Joseph’s people will soon be destroyed. And you aren’t even sad about it.
Amos,6,7,So you will be among the first to be taken away as prisoners. You won’t be able to enjoy good food. You won’t lie around on couches anymore.
Amos,6,8,"The Lord and King has made a promise in his own name. He is the Lord God who rules over all. He announces, “I hate the pride of Jacob’s people. I can’t stand their forts. I will hand the city of Samaria and everything in it over to their enemies.”"
Amos,6,9,"Ten people might be left in one house. If they are, they will die there."
Amos,6,10,"Relatives might come to burn the dead bodies. If they do, they’ll have to carry them out of the house first. They might ask someone still hiding there, “Is anyone else here with you?” If the answer is no, the relatives will go on to say, “Be quiet! We must not pray in the Lord ’s name.”"
Amos,6,11,That’s because the Lord has already given an order. He will smash large houses to pieces. He will crush small houses to bits.
Amos,6,12,Horses don’t run on rocky ground. People don’t plow the sea with oxen. But you have turned fair treatment into poison. You have turned the fruit of right living into bitterness.
Amos,6,13,"You are happy because you captured the town of Lo Debar. You say, “We were strong enough to take Karnaim too.”"
Amos,6,14,"But the Lord God rules over all. He announces, “People of Israel, I will stir up a nation against you. They will crush you from Lebo Hamath all the way down to the Arabah Valley.”"
Amos,7,1,The Lord and King gave me a vision. He was bringing large numbers of locusts on the land. The king’s share had already been harvested. Now the later crops were coming up.
Amos,7,2,"The locusts stripped the land clean. Then I cried out, “ Lord and King, forgive Israel! How can Jacob’s people continue? They are such a weak nation!”"
Amos,7,3,"So the Lord had pity on them. “I will let them continue for now,” he said."
Amos,7,4,The Lord and King gave me a second vision. He was using fire to punish his people. It dried up the deep waters. It burned the land up.
Amos,7,5,"Then I cried out, “ Lord and King, please stop! How can Jacob’s people continue? They are such a weak nation!”"
Amos,7,6,"So the Lord had pity on them. “I will let them continue for now,” the Lord and King said."
Amos,7,7,"Then the Lord gave me a third vision. He was standing by a wall. It had been built very straight, all the way up and down. He was holding a plumb line."
Amos,7,8,"The Lord asked me, “What do you see, Amos?” “A plumb line,” I replied. Then the Lord said, “Look at what I am doing. I am hanging a plumb line next to my people Israel. It will show how crooked they are. I will no longer spare them."
Amos,7,9,“The high places where Isaac’s people worship other gods will be destroyed. The other places of worship in Israel will also be torn down. I will use my sword to attack Jeroboam’s royal family.”
Amos,7,10,"Amaziah was priest of Bethel. He sent a message to Jeroboam, the king of Israel. He said, “Amos is making evil plans against you right here in Israel. The people in the land can’t stand to listen to what he’s saying."
Amos,7,11,"Amos is telling them, “ ‘Jeroboam will be killed by a sword. The people of Israel will be taken away as prisoners. They will be carried off from their own land.’ ”"
Amos,7,12,"Then Amaziah said to Amos, “Get out of Israel, you prophet! Go back to the land of Judah. Earn your living there. Do your prophesying there."
Amos,7,13,Don’t prophesy here at Bethel anymore. This is where the king worships. The main temple in the kingdom is located here.”
Amos,7,14,"Amos answered Amaziah, “I was not a prophet. I wasn’t even the son of a prophet. I was a shepherd. I also took care of sycamore-fig trees."
Amos,7,15,"But the Lord took me away from taking care of the flock. He said to me, ‘Go. Prophesy to my people Israel.’"
Amos,7,16,"Now then, listen to the Lord ’s message. You say, “ ‘Don’t prophesy against Israel. Stop preaching against the people of Isaac.’"
Amos,7,17,"“But the Lord says, “ ‘Your wife will become a prostitute in the city of Bethel. Your sons and daughters will be killed by swords. Your land will be measured and divided up. And you yourself will die in another country. The people of Israel will surely be taken away as prisoners. They will be carried off from their own land.’ ”"
Amos,8,1,The Lord and King gave me a vision. He showed me a basket of ripe fruit.
Amos,8,2,"“What do you see, Amos?” he asked. “A basket of ripe fruit,” I replied. Then the Lord said to me, “The time is ripe for my people Israel. I will no longer spare them."
Amos,8,3,"“The time is coming when the songs in the temple will turn to weeping,” announces the Lord and King. “Many, many bodies will be thrown everywhere! So be quiet!”"
Amos,8,4,"Listen to me, you who walk all over needy people. You crush those who are poor in the land."
Amos,8,5,"You say, “When will the New Moon feast be over? Then we can sell our grain. When will the Sabbath day come to an end? Then people can buy our wheat.” But you measure out less than the right amount. You raise your prices. You cheat others by using dishonest scales."
Amos,8,6,You buy poor people to make slaves out of them. You buy those who are in need for a mere pair of sandals. You even sell the worthless parts of your wheat.
Amos,8,7,"People of Jacob, you are proud that the Lord is your God. But he has made a promise in his own name. He says, “I will never forget anything Israel has done."
Amos,8,8,“The land will tremble because of what will happen. Everyone who lives in it will mourn. So the whole land will rise like the Nile River. It will be stirred up. Then it will settle back down again like that river in Egypt.”
Amos,8,9,"The Lord and King announces, “At that time I will make the sun go down at noon. The earth will become dark in the middle of the day."
Amos,8,10,I will turn your holy feasts into times for mourning. I will turn all your songs into weeping. You will have to wear the clothing of sadness. You will shave your heads. I will make you mourn as if your only son had died. The end of that time will be like a bitter day.”
Amos,8,11,"The Lord and King announces, “The days are coming when I will send hunger through the land. But people will not be hungry for food. They will not be thirsty for water. Instead, they will be hungry to hear a message from me."
Amos,8,12,People will wander from the Dead Sea to the Mediterranean. They will travel from north to east. They will look for a message from me. But they will not find it.
Amos,8,13,“At that time “the lovely young women and strong young men will faint because they are so thirsty.
Amos,8,14,"Some people make promises in the name of Samaria’s god. That god has led them astray. Others say, ‘People of Dan, you can be sure that your god is alive.’ Still others say, ‘You can be sure that Beersheba’s god is alive.’ But all these people will fall dead. They will never get up again.”"
Amos,9,1,"I saw the Lord standing next to the altar in the temple. He said to me, “Strike the tops of the temple pillars. Then the heavy stones at the base of the entrance will shake. Bring everything down on the heads of everyone there. I will kill with my swords those who are left alive. None of the Israelites will escape. None will get away."
Amos,9,2,They might dig down deep. But my powerful hand will take them out of there. They might climb up to the heavens. But I will bring them down from there.
Amos,9,3,They might hide on top of Mount Carmel. But I will hunt them down and grab them. They might hide from me at the bottom of the ocean. But even there I will command the serpent to bite them.
Amos,9,4,Their enemies might take them away as prisoners to another country. But there I will command Israel’s enemies to cut them down with swords. I will keep my eye on Israel to harm them. I will not help them.”
Amos,9,5,"The Lord rules over all. The Lord touches the earth, and it melts. Everyone who lives in it mourns. The whole land rises like the Nile River. Then it settles back down again like that river in Egypt."
Amos,9,6,The Lord builds his palace high in the heavens. He lays its foundation on the earth. He sends for the waters in the clouds. Then he pours them out on the surface of the land. His name is the Lord.
Amos,9,7,"“You Israelites are just like the people of Cush to me,” announces the Lord. “I brought Israel up from Egypt. I also brought the Philistines from Crete and the Arameans from Kir."
Amos,9,8,"“I am the Lord and King. My eyes are watching the sinful kingdom of Israel. I will wipe it off the face of the earth. But I will not totally destroy the people of Jacob,” announces the Lord."
Amos,9,9,“I will give an order. I will shake the people of Israel among all the nations. They will be like grain that is shaken through a screen. Not a pebble will fall to the ground.
Amos,9,10,"All the sinners among my people will be killed by swords. They say, ‘Nothing bad will ever happen to us.’"
Amos,9,11,“The time will come when I will set up David’s fallen shelter. I will repair its broken walls. I will rebuild what was destroyed. I will make it what it used to be.
Amos,9,12,"Then my people will take control of those who are left alive in Edom. They will also possess all the nations that belong to me,” announces the Lord. He will do all these things."
Amos,9,13,"“The days are coming,” announces the Lord. “At that time those who plow the land will catch up with those who harvest the crops. Those who stomp on grapes will catch up with those who plant the vines. Fresh wine will drip from the mountains. It will flow down from all the hills."
Amos,9,14,I will bring my people Israel back home. I will bless them with great success again. They will rebuild the destroyed cities and live in them. They will plant vineyards and drink the wine they produce. They will make gardens and eat their fruit.
Amos,9,15,"I will plant Israel in their own land. They will never again be removed from the land I have given them,” says the Lord your God."
