Isaiah,1,1,"Here is the vision about Judah and Jerusalem that Isaiah saw. It came to him when Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah were ruling. They were kings of Judah. Isaiah was the son of Amoz."
Isaiah,1,2,"Listen to me, you heavens! Pay attention to me, earth! The Lord has said, “I raised children. I brought them up. But they have refused to obey me."
Isaiah,1,3,The ox knows its master. The donkey knows where its owner feeds it. But Israel does not know me. My people do not understand me.”
Isaiah,1,4,How terrible it will be for this sinful nation! They are loaded down with guilt. They are people who do nothing but evil. They are children who are always sinning. They have deserted the Lord. They have turned against the Holy One of Israel. They have turned their backs on him.
Isaiah,1,5,"Israel, why do you want to be beaten all the time? Why do you always refuse to obey the Lord? Your head is covered with wounds. Your whole heart is weak."
Isaiah,1,6,"There isn’t a healthy spot on your body. You are not healthy from the bottom of your feet to the top of your head. You have nothing but wounds, cuts and open sores. They haven’t been cleaned up or bandaged or treated with olive oil."
Isaiah,1,7,Your country has been deserted. Your cities have been burned down. The food from your fields is being eaten up by outsiders. They are doing it right in front of you. Your land has been completely destroyed. It looks as if strangers have taken it over.
Isaiah,1,8,The city of Zion is left like a shed where someone stands guard in a vineyard. It is left like a hut in a cucumber field. It’s like a city being attacked.
Isaiah,1,9,"The Lord who rules over all has let some people live through that time of trouble. If he hadn’t, we would have become like Sodom. We would have been like Gomorrah."
Isaiah,1,10,"Rulers of Sodom, hear the Lord ’s message. People of Gomorrah, listen to the instruction of our God."
Isaiah,1,11,"“Do you think I need any more of your sacrifices?” asks the Lord. “I have more than enough of your burnt offerings. I have more than enough of rams and the fat of your fattest animals. I do not find any pleasure in the blood of your bulls, lambs and goats."
Isaiah,1,12,Who asked you to bring all these animals when you come to worship me? Who asked you and your animals to walk all over my courtyards?
Isaiah,1,13,"Stop bringing offerings that do not mean anything to me! I hate your incense. I can’t stand your worthless gatherings. I can’t stand the way you celebrate your New Moon feasts, Sabbath days and special services."
Isaiah,1,14,Your New Moon feasts and your other appointed feasts I hate with my whole being. They have become a heavy load to me. I am tired of carrying it.
Isaiah,1,15,You might spread out your hands toward me when you pray. But I do not look at you. You might even offer many prayers. But I am not listening to them. Your hands are covered with the blood of the people you have murdered.
Isaiah,1,16,So wash and make yourselves clean. Get your evil actions out of my sight! Stop doing what is wrong!
Isaiah,1,17,Learn to do what is right! Treat people fairly. Help those who are treated badly. Stand up in court for children whose fathers have died. And do the same thing for widows.
Isaiah,1,18,"“Come. Let us settle this matter,” says the Lord. “Even though your sins are bright red, they will be as white as snow. Even though they are deep red, they will be white like wool."
Isaiah,1,19,"But you have to be willing to change and obey me. If you are, you will eat the good things that grow on the land."
Isaiah,1,20,"But if you are not willing to obey me, you will be killed by swords.” The Lord has spoken."
Isaiah,1,21,See how the faithful city of Jerusalem has become like a prostitute! Once it was full of people who treated others fairly. Those who did what was right used to live in it. But now murderers live there!
Isaiah,1,22,"Jerusalem, your silver isn’t pure anymore. Your best wine has been made weak with water."
Isaiah,1,23,Your rulers refuse to obey the Lord. They join forces with robbers. All of them love to accept money from those who want special favors. They are always looking for gifts from other people. They don’t stand up in court for children whose fathers have died. They don’t do it for widows either.
Isaiah,1,24,"The Lord is the Mighty One of Israel. The Lord who rules over all announces, “Israel, you have become my enemies. I will act against you in my anger. I will pay you back for what you have done."
Isaiah,1,25,I will turn my power against you. I will make you completely ‘clean.’ I will remove everything that is not pure.
Isaiah,1,26,I will give you leaders like the ones you had long ago. I will give you rulers like those you had at the beginning. Then you will be called the City That Does What Is Right. You will also be called the Faithful City.”
Isaiah,1,27,Zion will be saved when justice is done. Those who are sorry for their sins will be saved when what is right is done.
Isaiah,1,28,But sinners and those who refuse to obey the Lord will be destroyed. And those who desert the Lord will die.
Isaiah,1,29,"“Israel, you take delight in worshiping among the sacred oak trees. You will be full of shame for doing that. You have chosen to worship in the sacred gardens. You will be dishonored for doing that."
Isaiah,1,30,You will be like an oak tree whose leaves are dying. You will be like a garden that doesn’t have any water.
Isaiah,1,31,Your strongest men will become like dry pieces of wood. Their worship of other gods will be the spark that lights the fire. Everything will be burned up. No one will be there to put the fire out.”
Isaiah,2,1,"Here is a vision that Isaiah, the son of Amoz, saw about Judah and Jerusalem."
Isaiah,2,2,In the last days the mountain where the Lord ’s temple is located will be famous. It will be the highest mountain of all. It will be raised above the hills. All the nations will go to it.
Isaiah,2,3,"People from many nations will go there. They will say, “Come. Let us go up to the Lord ’s mountain. Let’s go to the temple of Jacob’s God. He will teach us how we should live. Then we will live the way he wants us to.” The law of the Lord will be taught at Zion. His message will go out from Jerusalem."
Isaiah,2,4,He will judge between the nations. He’ll settle problems among many of them. They will hammer their swords into plows. They’ll hammer their spears into pruning tools. Nations will not go to war against one another. They won’t even train to fight anymore.
Isaiah,2,5,"People of Jacob, come. Let us live the way the Lord has taught us to."
Isaiah,2,6," Lord , you have deserted the people of Jacob. They are your people. The land is full of false beliefs from the east. The people practice evil magic, just as the Philistines do. They do what ungodly people do."
Isaiah,2,7,Their land is full of silver and gold. There is no end to their treasures. Their land is full of horses. There is no end to their chariots.
Isaiah,2,8,Their land is full of statues of gods. Their people bow down to what their own hands have made. They bow down to what their fingers have shaped.
Isaiah,2,9,So people will be brought low. Everyone will be made humble. Do not forgive them.
Isaiah,2,10,"Go and hide in caves in the rocks, you people! Hide in holes in the ground. Hide from the terrifying presence of the Lord! Hide when he comes in glory and majesty!"
Isaiah,2,11,Anyone who brags will be brought low. Anyone who is proud will be made humble. The Lord alone will be honored at that time.
Isaiah,2,12,The Lord who rules over all has set apart a day when he will judge. He has set it apart for all those who are proud and think they are important. He has set it apart for all those who brag about themselves. All of them will be brought low.
Isaiah,2,13,The Lord has set that day apart for all the cedar trees in Lebanon. They are very tall. He has set that day apart for all the oak trees in Bashan.
Isaiah,2,14,He has set it apart for all the towering mountains. He has set it apart for all the high hills.
Isaiah,2,15,He has set it apart for every high tower and every strong wall.
Isaiah,2,16,He has set it apart for every trading ship and every beautiful boat.
Isaiah,2,17,Anyone who brags will be brought low. Anyone who is proud will be made humble. The Lord alone will be honored at that time.
Isaiah,2,18,And the statues of gods will totally disappear.
Isaiah,2,19,"People will run and hide in caves in the rocks. They will go into holes in the ground. They will run away from the terrifying presence of the Lord. They will run when he comes in glory and majesty. When he comes, he will shake the earth."
Isaiah,2,20,"People had made some statues of gods out of silver. They had made others out of gold. Then they worshiped them. But when the Lord comes, they will throw the statues away to the moles and bats."
Isaiah,2,21,"Those people will run and hide in caves in the rocks. They will go into holes in the cliffs. They will run away from the terrifying presence of the Lord. They will run when he comes in glory and majesty. When he comes, he will shake the earth."
Isaiah,2,22,"Stop trusting in mere human beings, who can’t help you. They only live for a little while. What good are they?"
Isaiah,3,1,Here is what the Lord who rules over all is about to do. The Lord will take away from Jerusalem and Judah supplies and help alike. He will take away all the supplies of food and water.
Isaiah,3,2,He’ll take away heroes and soldiers. He’ll take away judges and prophets. He’ll take away fortune tellers and elders.
Isaiah,3,3,"He’ll take away captains of groups of 50 men. He’ll take away government leaders. He’ll take away advisers, skilled workers and those who are clever at doing evil magic."
Isaiah,3,4,The Lord will make mere youths their leaders. Children will rule over them.
Isaiah,3,5,People will treat one another badly. They will fight against one another. They will fight against their neighbors. Young people will attack old people. Ordinary people will attack those who are more important.
Isaiah,3,6,"A man will grab one of his brothers in his father’s house. He will say, “You have a coat. So you be our leader. Take charge of all these broken-down buildings!”"
Isaiah,3,7,"But at that time the brother will cry out, “I can’t help you. I don’t have any food or clothing in my house. Don’t make me the leader of these people.”"
Isaiah,3,8,Jerusalem is about to fall. And so is Judah. They say and do things against the Lord. They dare to disobey him to his very face.
Isaiah,3,9,"The look on their faces is a witness against them. They show off their sin, just as the people of Sodom did. They don’t even try to hide it. How terrible it will be for them! They have brought trouble on themselves."
Isaiah,3,10,Tell those who do what is right that things will go well with them. They will enjoy the results of the good things they’ve done.
Isaiah,3,11,But how terrible it will be for those who do what is evil! Trouble is about to fall on them. They will be paid back for the evil things they’ve done.
Isaiah,3,12,"Those who are young treat my people badly. Women rule over them. My people, your leaders have taken you down the wrong path. They have turned you away from the right path."
Isaiah,3,13,The Lord takes his place in court. He stands up to judge the people.
Isaiah,3,14,"He judges the elders and leaders of his people. He says to them, “My people are like a vineyard. You have destroyed them. The things you have taken from poor people are in your houses."
Isaiah,3,15,What do you mean by crushing my people? Why are you grinding the faces of the poor into the dirt?” announces the Lord. He is the Lord who rules over all.
Isaiah,3,16,"The Lord continues, “The women in Zion are very proud. They walk along with their noses in the air. They tease men with their eyes. They sway their hips as they walk along. Little chains jingle on their ankles."
Isaiah,3,17,So I will put sores on the heads of Zion’s women. And I will remove the hair from their heads.”
Isaiah,3,18,"At that time the Lord will take away the beautiful things they wear. He will take away their decorations, headbands and moon-shaped necklaces."
Isaiah,3,19,"He’ll take away their earrings, bracelets and veils."
Isaiah,3,20,"He’ll remove their headdresses, anklets and belts. He’ll take away their perfume bottles and charms."
Isaiah,3,21,He’ll remove the rings they wear on their fingers and in their noses.
Isaiah,3,22,He’ll take away their fine robes and their capes and coats. He’ll take away their purses
Isaiah,3,23,"and mirrors. And he’ll take away their linen clothes, turbans and shawls."
Isaiah,3,24,"Instead of smelling sweet, the women will smell bad. Instead of wearing belts, they will wear ropes. Instead of having beautiful hair, they won’t have any hair at all. Instead of wearing fine clothes, they’ll wear rough clothes to show how sad they are. Instead of being beautiful, on their bodies they’ll have the marks of their owners."
Isaiah,3,25,"Jerusalem, your men will be killed by swords. Your soldiers will die in battle."
Isaiah,3,26,"The city of Zion will be very sad. Like a widow, she will lose everything. She will sit on the ground and mourn."
Isaiah,4,1,"At that time seven women will grab hold of one man. They’ll say to him, “We will eat our own food. We’ll provide our own clothes. Just let us become your wives. Take away our shame!”"
Isaiah,4,2,At that time Israel’s king will be beautiful and glorious. He will be called The Branch of the Lord . The fruit of the land will be the pride and glory of those who are still left alive in Israel.
Isaiah,4,3,Those who are left in Zion will be called holy. They will be recorded among those who are alive in Jerusalem.
Isaiah,4,4,The Lord will wash away the sin of the women in Zion. He will clean up the blood that was spilled there. He will judge those who spilled that blood. His burning anger will blaze out at them.
Isaiah,4,5,Then the Lord will create over Jerusalem a cloud of smoke by day. He will also create a glow of flaming fire at night. The cloud and fire will appear over all of Mount Zion. They will also appear over the people who gather together there. The Lord ’s glory will be like a tent over everything.
Isaiah,4,6,It will cover the people and give them shade from the hot sun all day long. It will be a safe place where they can hide from storms and rain.
Isaiah,5,1,I will sing a song for the Lord. He is the one I love. It’s a song about his vineyard Israel. The one I love had a vineyard. It was on a hillside that had rich soil.
Isaiah,5,2,He dug up the soil and removed its stones. He planted the very best vines in it. He built a lookout tower there. He also cut out a winepress for it. Then he kept looking for a crop of good grapes. But the vineyard produced only bad fruit.
Isaiah,5,3,"So the Lord said, “People of Jerusalem and Judah, you be the judge between me and my vineyard."
Isaiah,5,4,What more could I have done for my vineyard? I did everything I could. I kept looking for a crop of good grapes. So why did it produce only bad ones?
Isaiah,5,5,Now I will tell you what I am going to do to my vineyard. I will take away its fence. And the vineyard will be destroyed. I will break down its wall. And people will walk all over my vineyard.
Isaiah,5,6,I will turn my vineyard into a dry and empty desert. It will not be pruned or taken care of. Thorns and bushes will grow there. I will command the clouds not to rain on it.”
Isaiah,5,7,The vineyard of the Lord who rules over all is the nation of Israel. The people of Judah are the vines he took delight in. He kept looking for them to do what is fair. But all he saw was blood being spilled. He kept looking for them to do what is right. But all he heard were cries of suffering.
Isaiah,5,8,How terrible it will be for you who get too many houses! How terrible for you who get too many fields! Finally there won’t be any space left in the land. Then you will live all alone.
Isaiah,5,9,"I heard the Lord who rules over all announce a message. He said, “You can be sure that the great houses will become empty. The fine homes will be left with no one living in them."
Isaiah,5,10,A ten-acre vineyard will produce only six gallons of wine. 360 pounds of seeds will produce only 36 pounds of grain.”
Isaiah,5,11,How terrible it will be for those who get up early in the morning to start drinking! How terrible for those who stay up late at night until they are drunk with wine!
Isaiah,5,12,"They have harps and lyres at their banquets. They have tambourines, flutes and wine. But they don’t have any concern for the mighty acts of the Lord. They don’t have any respect for what his power has done."
Isaiah,5,13,So my people will be taken away as prisoners. That’s because they don’t understand what the Lord has done. Their nobles will die of hunger. The rest of the people won’t have any water to drink.
Isaiah,5,14,So Death opens its jaws to receive them. Its mouth is open wide to swallow them up. Their nobles and the rest of the people will go down into it. They will go there together with all those who have wild parties.
Isaiah,5,15,So people will be brought low. Everyone will be made humble. Those who brag will be brought down.
Isaiah,5,16,But the Lord who rules over all will be honored because he judges fairly. The holy God will prove that he is holy by doing what is right.
Isaiah,5,17,Then sheep will graze as if they were in their own grasslands. Lambs will eat grass among the destroyed buildings where rich people used to live.
Isaiah,5,18,How terrible it will be for those who continue to sin and lie about it! How terrible for those who keep on doing what is evil as if they were tied to it!
Isaiah,5,19,"How terrible for those who say, “Let God hurry up and do what he says he will. We want to see it happen. Let us see the plan of the Holy One of Israel. We want to know what it is.”"
Isaiah,5,20,How terrible it will be for those who say that what is evil is good! How terrible for those who say that what is good is evil! How terrible for those who say that darkness is light and light is darkness! How terrible for those who say that what is bitter is sweet and what is sweet is bitter!
Isaiah,5,21,How terrible it will be for those who think they are wise! How terrible for those who think they are really clever!
Isaiah,5,22,How terrible it will be for those who are heroes at drinking wine! How terrible for those who are heroes at mixing drinks!
Isaiah,5,23,How terrible for those who take money to set guilty people free! How terrible for those who don’t treat good people fairly!
Isaiah,5,24,Flames of fire burn up straw. Dry grass sinks down into those flames. Evil people will be like plants whose roots rot away. They will be like flowers that are blown away like dust. That’s because they have said no to the law of the Lord who rules over all. They have turned against the message of the Holy One of Israel.
Isaiah,5,25,"So the Lord is angry with his people. He raises his hand against them and strikes them down. The mountains shake. The bodies of dead people lie in the streets like trash. Even then, the Lord is still angry. His hand is still raised against them."
Isaiah,5,26,He lifts up a banner to gather the nations that are far away. He whistles for them to come from the farthest places on earth. Here they come. They are moving very quickly.
Isaiah,5,27,None of them grows tired. None of them falls down. None of them sleeps or even takes a nap. All of them are ready for battle. Every belt is pulled tight. Not a single sandal strap is broken.
Isaiah,5,28,The enemies’ arrows are sharp. All their bows are ready. The hooves of their horses are as hard as rock. Their chariot wheels turn like a twister.
Isaiah,5,29,The sound of their army is like the roar of lions. It’s like the roar of young lions. They growl as they capture what they were chasing. They carry it off. No one can take it away from them.
Isaiah,5,30,"At that time the enemy army will roar over Israel. It will sound like the roaring of the ocean. If someone looks at the land of Israel, there is only darkness and trouble. The clouds will make even the sun become dark."
Isaiah,6,1,"In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord. He was seated on his throne. His long robe filled the temple. He was highly honored."
Isaiah,6,2,Above him were seraphs. Each of them had six wings. With two wings they covered their faces. With two wings they covered their feet. And with two wings they were flying.
Isaiah,6,3,"They were calling out to one another. They were saying, “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord who rules over all. The whole earth is full of his glory.”"
Isaiah,6,4,The sound of their voices caused the stone doorframe to shake. The temple was filled with smoke.
Isaiah,6,5,“How terrible it is for me!” I cried out. “I’m about to be destroyed! My mouth speaks sinful words. And I live among people who speak sinful words. Now I have seen the King with my own eyes. He is the Lord who rules over all.”
Isaiah,6,6,A seraph flew over to me. He was holding a hot coal. He had used tongs to take it from the altar.
Isaiah,6,7,"He touched my mouth with the coal. He said, “This has touched your lips. Your guilt has been taken away. Your sin has been paid for.”"
Isaiah,6,8,"Then I heard the voice of the Lord. He said, “Who will I send? Who will go for us?” I said, “Here I am. Send me!”"
Isaiah,6,9,"So he said, “Go and speak to these people. Tell them, “ ‘You will hear but never understand. You will see but never know what you are seeing.’"
Isaiah,6,10,Make the hearts of these people stubborn. Plug up their ears. Close their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes. They might hear with their ears. They might understand with their hearts. And they might turn to me and be healed.”
Isaiah,6,11,"Then I said, “Lord, how long will it be like that?” He answered, “It will last until the cities of Israel are destroyed. It will last until no one is living in them. It will last until the houses are deserted. The fields will be completely destroyed."
Isaiah,6,12,It will last until the Lord has sent everyone far away. The land will be totally deserted.
Isaiah,6,13,"Suppose only a tenth of the people remain there. Even then the land will be completely destroyed again. But when oak trees and terebinth trees are cut down, stumps are left. And my holy people will be like stumps that begin to grow again.”"
Isaiah,7,1,Ahaz was king of Judah. Rezin was king of Aram. And Pekah was king of Israel. Rezin and Pekah marched up to fight against Jerusalem. But they couldn’t overpower it. Ahaz was the son of Jotham and the grandson of Uzziah. Pekah was the son of Remaliah.
Isaiah,7,2,"The royal family of Ahaz was told, “The army of Aram has joined forces with Ephraim’s army.” So the hearts of Ahaz and his people trembled with fear. They shook just as trees in the forest shake when the wind blows through them."
Isaiah,7,3,"The Lord said to Isaiah, “Go out and see Ahaz. Take your son Shear-Jashub with you. Meet Ahaz at the end of the channel that brings water from the Upper Pool. It is on the road to the Washerman’s Field."
Isaiah,7,4,"Tell Ahaz, ‘Be careful. Stay calm. Do not be afraid. Do not lose hope because of the great anger of Rezin, Aram and the son of Remaliah. After all, they are nothing but two pieces of smoking firewood."
Isaiah,7,5,"Aram, Ephraim and Remaliah’s son have planned to destroy you. They said,"
Isaiah,7,6,“Let’s march into Judah and attack it. Let’s tear everything down. Then we can share the land among ourselves. And we can make Tabeel’s son king over it.”
Isaiah,7,7,"But I am the Lord and King. I say, “ ‘ “That will not happen. It will not take place."
Isaiah,7,8,The capital of Aram is Damascus. And the ruler of Damascus is only Rezin. Do not worry about the people of Ephraim. They will be too crushed to be considered a people. That will happen before 65 years are over.
Isaiah,7,9,"The capital of Ephraim is Samaria. And the ruler of Samaria is only Remaliah’s son. If you do not stand firm in your faith, you will not stand at all.” ’ ”"
Isaiah,7,10,"The Lord spoke to Ahaz through Isaiah again. He said,"
Isaiah,7,11,“I am the Lord your God. Ask me to give you a sign. It can be anything in the deepest grave or in the highest heaven.”
Isaiah,7,12,"But Ahaz said, “I won’t ask. I won’t test the Lord .”"
Isaiah,7,13,"Then Isaiah said, “Listen, you members of the royal family of David! Isn’t it enough for you to test the patience of human beings? Are you also going to test the patience of my God?"
Isaiah,7,14,The Lord himself will give you a sign. The virgin is going to have a baby. She will give birth to a son. And he will be called Immanuel.
Isaiah,7,15,He will still be very young when he can decide between right and wrong.
Isaiah,7,16,"Even before then, the lands of the two kings you fear will be ruined."
Isaiah,7,17,The Lord will also bring the king of Assyria against you. And he will bring him against your people and the whole royal family. That will be a time of trouble. It will be unlike any since the people of Ephraim broke away from Judah.”
Isaiah,7,18,At that time the Lord will whistle for the Egyptians. They will come like flies from the Nile River in Egypt. He will also whistle for the Assyrians. They will come from their country like bees.
Isaiah,7,19,All of them will come and camp in the deep valleys. They will camp in caves in the rocks. And they’ll camp near bushes and water holes.
Isaiah,7,20,At that time the Lord will use the Assyrians to punish you. Ahaz had hired them earlier from east of the Euphrates River. Now their king will be like a razor in the Lord’s hand. He will shave the hair from your head and private parts. He will also shave off your beards.
Isaiah,7,21,At that time a person may only be able to keep alive one young cow and two goats.
Isaiah,7,22,"But they will give plenty of milk to live on. In fact, everyone left in the land will only have milk curds and honey to eat."
Isaiah,7,23,"The land used to have vineyards with 1,000 vines worth 25 pounds of silver. But soon the whole land will be covered with thorns and bushes."
Isaiah,7,24,Hunters will go there with bows and arrows. That’s because it will be covered with bushes and thorns.
Isaiah,7,25,All the hills used to be plowed with hoes. But you won’t go there anymore. That’s because you will be afraid of the thorns and bushes. Cattle will be turned loose on those hills. Sheep will also run there.
Isaiah,8,1,"The Lord said to me, “Get a large sheet of paper. Write ‘Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz’ on it with a pen.”"
Isaiah,8,2,So I sent for Zechariah and Uriah the priest. Zechariah is the son of Jeberekiah. Zechariah and Uriah were witnesses for me whom I could trust.
Isaiah,8,3,"Then I went and slept with my wife, who was a prophet. She became pregnant and had a baby boy. The Lord said to me, “Name him Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz."
Isaiah,8,4,The king of Assyria will carry off the wealth of Damascus. He will also carry away the goods that were taken from Samaria. That will happen before the boy knows how to say ‘My father’ or ‘My mother.’ ”
Isaiah,8,5,"The Lord continued,"
Isaiah,8,6,“I am like the gently flowing stream of Siloam. But the people of Judah have turned their backs on me. They are filled with joy because of the fall of Rezin and the son of Remaliah.
Isaiah,8,7,So I am about to bring against these people the king of Assyria and his whole army. The Assyrians will be like the mighty Euphrates River when it is flooding. They will run over everything in their path.
Isaiah,8,8,"They will sweep on into Judah like a flood. They will pass through Judah and reach all the way to Jerusalem. Immanuel, they will attack your land like an eagle. Their wings will spread out and cover it.”"
Isaiah,8,9,"Sound the battle cry, you nations! But you will be torn apart. Listen, all you lands far away! Prepare for battle! But you will be torn apart. Prepare for battle! But you will be torn apart."
Isaiah,8,10,Make your battle plans! But you won’t succeed. Give your orders! But they won’t be carried out. That’s because God is with us.
Isaiah,8,11,"The Lord speaks to me while his powerful hand is on me. He is warning me not to live the way these people live. He says,"
Isaiah,8,12,"“People of Judah, do not agree with those who say Isaiah is guilty of treason. Do not fear what they fear. Do not be afraid."
Isaiah,8,13,The Lord rules over all. So you must think about him as holy. You must have respect for him. You must fear him.
Isaiah,8,14,Then the Lord will be a holy place of safety for you. But that’s not true for many people in Israel and Judah. He will be a stone that causes them to trip. He will be a rock that makes them fall. And for the people of Jerusalem he will be a trap and a snare.
Isaiah,8,15,Many of them will trip. They will fall and be broken. They will be trapped and captured.”
Isaiah,8,16,Tie up and seal this warning that the Lord said to you through me. Preserve among my followers what he taught you through me.
Isaiah,8,17,I will wait for the Lord. He is turning his face away from Jacob’s people. I will put my trust in him.
Isaiah,8,18,Here I am. Here are the children the Lord has given me. We are signs and reminders to Israel from the Lord who rules over all. He lives on Mount Zion.
Isaiah,8,19,There are people who get messages from those who have died. But these people only whisper words that are barely heard. Suppose someone tells you to ask for advice from these people. Shouldn’t you ask for advice from your God instead? Why should you get advice from dead people to help those who are alive?
Isaiah,8,20,Follow what the Lord taught you and said to you through me. People who don’t speak in keeping with these words will have no hope in the morning.
Isaiah,8,21,"They will suffer and be hungry. They’ll wander through the land. When they are very hungry, they will become angry. They’ll look up toward heaven. They’ll ask for bad things to happen to their king and their God."
Isaiah,8,22,Then they will look at the earth. They’ll see nothing but suffering and darkness. They’ll see terrible sadness. They’ll be driven into total darkness.
Isaiah,9,1,"But there won’t be any more sadness for those who were suffering. In the past the Lord brought shame on the land of Zebulun. He also brought shame on the land of Naphtali.

Isaiah,19,11,"The officials of the city of Zoan are very foolish. Pharaoh’s wise men give advice that doesn’t make any sense. How can they dare to say to Pharaoh, “We’re among the wise men”? How can they say to him, “We’re like the advisers to the kings of long ago”?"
Isaiah,19,12,"Pharaoh, where are your wise men now? Let them tell you what the Lord who rules over all has planned against Egypt."

Isaiah,19,14,The Lord has given them a spirit that makes them feel dizzy. They make Egypt unsteady in everything it does. Egypt is like a person who drinks too much. He throws up and then walks around in the mess he’s made.
Isaiah,19,15,No one in Egypt can do anything to help them. Its elders and important leaders can’t help them. Its prophets and priests can’t do anything. Those who rule over others can’t help. And those who bow down to them can’t help either.

Isaiah,21,8,“My master!” the guard shouts back. “Day after day I stand here on the lookout tower. Every night I stay here on duty.
Isaiah,21,9,"Look! Here comes a man in a chariot! It’s being pulled by a team of horses. He’s calling out the news, ‘Babylon has fallen! It has fallen! All the statues of its gods lie broken in pieces on the ground!’ ”"

Isaiah,22,3,All your leaders have run away. They’ve been captured without a single arrow being shot. All you who were caught were taken away as prisoners. You ran off while your enemies were still far away.
Isaiah,22,4,"So I said, “Leave me alone. Let me weep bitter tears. Don’t try to comfort me. My people have been destroyed.”"

Isaiah,22,11,You built a pool between the two walls. You used it to save the water that was running down from the Old Pool. But you didn’t look to the God who made it all possible. You didn’t pay any attention to the God who planned everything long ago.
Isaiah,22,12,The Lord who rules over all called out to you at that time. The Lord told you to weep and cry. He told you to tear your hair out. And he told you to put on the rough clothing people wear when they’re sad.

Isaiah,22,17,"“ ‘Watch out, you mighty man! The Lord is about to grab you. He is about to throw you away."
Isaiah,22,18,He will roll you up tightly like a ball. He will throw you into a very large country. There you will die. And that’s where the chariots you were so proud of will be. Those chariots will then bring nothing but shame on your master’s family!
Isaiah,22,19,The Lord will remove you from your job. You will be brought down from your high position.
Isaiah,22,20,“ ‘At that time he will send for his servant Eliakim. He is the son of Hilkiah.

Isaiah,22,23,The Lord will set him firmly in place like a peg driven into a wall. He will hold a position of honor in his family.
Isaiah,22,24,The good name of his whole family will depend on him. They will be like bowls and jars hanging on a peg.
Isaiah,22,25,"“ ‘But a new day is coming,’ ” announces the Lord who rules over all. “ ‘At that time the peg that was driven into the wall will give way. It will break off and fall down. And the heavy load hanging on it will also fall.’ ” The Lord has spoken."

Isaiah,23,2,"People on the island of Tyre, be silent. Traders from the city of Sidon, be quiet. Those who sail on the Mediterranean Sea have made you rich."

Isaiah,23,8,Tyre was a city that produced kings. Its traders were princes. They were honored all over the earth. So who planned to destroy such a city?
Isaiah,23,9,The Lord who rules over all planned to do it. He wanted to bring down all its pride and glory. He wanted to shame those who were honored all over the earth.

Isaiah,23,14,"Men in the ships of Tarshish, cry out! Mighty Tyre is destroyed!"
Isaiah,23,15,"A time is coming when people will forget about Tyre for 70 years. That’s the length of a king’s life. But at the end of those 70 years, Tyre will be like the prostitute that people sing about. They say,"
Isaiah,23,16,"“Forgotten prostitute, pick up a harp. Walk through the city. Play the harp well. Sing many songs. Then you will be remembered.”"
Isaiah,23,17,"At the end of the 70 years, the Lord will punish Tyre. He will let it return to its way of life as a prostitute. It will earn its living with all the kingdoms on the face of the earth."
Isaiah,23,18,"But the money it earns will be set apart for the Lord . The money won’t be stored up or kept for Tyre. Instead, it will go to those who live the way the Lord wants them to. It will pay for plenty of food and fine clothes for them."
Isaiah,24,1,The Lord is going to completely destroy everything on earth. He will twist its surface. He’ll scatter those who live on it.

Isaiah,24,10,Destroyed cities will lie empty. People will lock themselves inside their houses.
Isaiah,24,11,In the streets people will cry out for wine. All joy will turn into sadness. All joyful sounds will be driven out of the earth.
Isaiah,24,12,All the buildings will be knocked down. Every city gate will be smashed to pieces.
Isaiah,24,13,That’s how it will be on the earth. And that’s how it will be among the nations. It will be as when workers knock all but a few olives off the trees. It will be like a vine that has only a few grapes left after the harvest.
Isaiah,24,14,Those who are left alive will shout for joy. People from the west will praise the Lord because he is the King.

Isaiah,24,16,"From one end of the earth to the other we hear singing. People are saying, “Give glory to the God who always does what is right.” But I said, “I feel very bad. I’m getting weaker and weaker. How terrible it is for me! People turn against one another. They can’t be trusted. So they turn against one another.”"
Isaiah,24,17,"Listen, you people of the earth. Terror, a pit and a trap are waiting for you."
Isaiah,24,18,Anyone who runs away from the terror will fall into the pit. Anyone who climbs out of the pit will be caught in the trap. The Lord will open the windows of the skies. He will flood the land. The foundations of the earth will shake.
Isaiah,24,19,The earth will be broken up. It will split open. It will be shaken to pieces.
Isaiah,24,20,The earth will be unsteady like someone who is drunk. It will sway like a tent in the wind. Its sin will weigh so heavily on it that it will fall. It will never get up again.
Isaiah,24,21,At that time the Lord will punish the spiritual forces of evil in the heavens above. He will also punish the kings on the earth below.

Isaiah,24,23,The Lord who rules over all will rule on Mount Zion in Jerusalem. The elders of the city will be there. They will see his great glory. His rule will be so glorious that the sun and moon will be too ashamed to shine.
Isaiah,25,1," Lord , you are my God. I will honor you. I will praise your name. You have been perfectly faithful. You have done wonderful things. You had planned them long ago."
Isaiah,25,2,You have turned cities into piles of trash. You have pulled down the high walls that were around them. You have destroyed our enemies’ forts. They will never be rebuilt.
Isaiah,25,3,Powerful nations will honor you. Even sinful people from their cities will have respect for you.
Isaiah,25,4,Poor people have come to you for safety. You have kept needy people safe when they were in trouble. You have been a place to hide when storms came. You have been a shade from the heat of the sun. Evil people attack us. They are like a storm beating against a wall.
Isaiah,25,5,They are like the heat of the desert. You stopped the noisy shouts of our enemies. You kept them from winning the battle over us and singing about it. You are like the shadow of a cloud that cools the earth.
Isaiah,25,6,On Mount Zion the Lord who rules over all will prepare a feast for all the nations. The best and richest foods and the finest aged wines will be served.

Isaiah,26,2,Open its gates so that those who do what is right can enter. They are the people who remain faithful to God.
Isaiah,26,3," Lord , you will give perfect peace to those who commit themselves to be faithful to you. That’s because they trust in you."
Isaiah,26,4,“Trust in the Lord forever. The Lord himself is the Rock. The Lord will keep us safe forever.

Isaiah,26,13," Lord , you are our God. Other masters besides you have ruled over us. But your name is the only one we honor."
Isaiah,26,14,Those other masters are now dead. They will never live again. Their spirits won’t rise from the dead. You punished them and destroyed them. You wiped out all memory of them.

Isaiah,26,16," Lord , when your people were suffering, they came to you. When you punished them, they could barely whisper a prayer."
Isaiah,26,17," Lord , you made us like a woman who is about to have a baby. She groans and cries out in pain."
Isaiah,26,18,We were pregnant and groaned with pain. But nothing was born. We didn’t bring your saving power to the earth. And the people of the world have not come to life.
Isaiah,26,19," Lord , your people who have died will live again. Their bodies will rise from the dead. Let those who lie in the grave wake up and shout for joy. You give life, Lord , like the dew of the morning. So the earth will give up its dead people."

Isaiah,27,3,“I am the Lord . I watch over my vineyard. I water it all the time. I guard it day and night. I do it so no one can harm it.
Isaiah,27,4,I am not angry with my vineyard. I wish thorns and bushes would come up in it. Then I would march out against them in battle. I would set all of them on fire.
Isaiah,27,5,So the enemies of my people should come to me for safety. They should make peace with me. I will say it again. They should make peace with me.”

They will crush them to pieces. No poles used to worship the female god named Asherah will be left standing. No incense altars will be left either.
Isaiah,27,10,Cities that have high walls around them will become empty. They will be settlements with no one in them. They will be like a desert. Calves will eat and lie down in them. They will strip bare the branches of their trees.
Isaiah,27,11,"When their twigs are dry, they will be broken off. Then women will come and make fires with them. The people of Jacob don’t understand the Lord. So the God who made them won’t be concerned about them. Their Creator won’t be kind to them."
Isaiah,27,12,At that time the Lord will separate Israel from other people. He will gather the Israelites together one by one. He will gather them from the Euphrates River to the Wadi of Egypt.
Isaiah,27,13,At that time a loud trumpet will be blown. Those who were dying in Assyria will come and worship the Lord . So will those who were taken away to Egypt. All of them will worship the Lord on his holy mountain in Jerusalem.
Isaiah,28,1,How terrible it will be for the city of Samaria! It sits on a hill like a wreath of flowers. The leaders of Ephraim are drunk. They take pride in their city. It sits above a valley that has rich soil. How terrible it will be for the glorious beauty of that fading flower!
Isaiah,28,2,The Lord will bring the strong and powerful king of Assyria against Samaria. The Lord will throw that city down to the ground with great force. It will be like a hailstorm. It will be like a wind that destroys everything. It will be like a driving rain and a flooding storm.
Isaiah,28,3,That city is like a wreath. The leaders of Ephraim are drunk. They take pride in their city. But its enemies will walk all over it.
Isaiah,28,4,"It sits on a hill above a rich valley. The city is like a wreath of flowers whose glorious beauty is fading away. But it will become like figs that are ripe before harvest. As soon as people see them, they pick them and swallow them."
Isaiah,28,5,At that time the Lord who rules over all will be like a glorious crown. He will be like a beautiful wreath for those of his people who will be left alive.
Isaiah,28,6,He will help those who are fair when they judge. He will give strength to those who turn back their enemies at the city gate.
Isaiah,28,7,Israel’s leaders are drunk from wine. They can’t walk straight. They are drunk from beer. They are unsteady on their feet. Priests and prophets drink beer. They can’t walk straight. They are mixed up from drinking too much wine. They drink too much beer. They are unsteady on their feet. The prophets see visions but don’t really understand them. The priests aren’t able to make good decisions.
Isaiah,28,8,They throw up. All the tables are covered with the mess they’ve made. There isn’t one spot on the tables that isn’t smelly and dirty.
Isaiah,28,9,"The Lord ’s people are making fun of him. They say, “Who does he think he’s trying to teach? Who does he think he’s explaining his message to? Is it to children who do not need their mother’s milk anymore? Is it to those who have just been taken from her breast?"
Isaiah,28,10,Here is how he teaches. Do this and do that. There is a rule for this and a rule for that. Learn a little here and learn a little there.”
Isaiah,28,11,"All right then, these people won’t listen to me. So God will speak to them. He will speak by using people who speak unfamiliar languages. He will speak by using the mouths of strangers."
Isaiah,28,12,"He said to his people, “I am offering you a resting place. Let those who are tired rest.” He continued, “I am offering you a place of peace and quiet.” But they wouldn’t listen."
Isaiah,28,13,"So then, here is what the Lord ’s message will become to them. Do this and do that. There is a rule for this and a rule for that. Learn a little here and learn a little there. So when they try to go forward, they’ll fall back and be wounded. They’ll be trapped and captured."
Isaiah,28,14,"Listen to the Lord ’s message, you who make fun of the truth. Listen, you who rule over these people in Jerusalem."
Isaiah,28,15,"You brag, “We have entered into a covenant with the place of the dead. We have made an agreement with the grave. When a terrible plague comes to punish us, it can’t touch us. That’s because we depend on lies to keep us safe. We hide behind what isn’t true.”"
Isaiah,28,16,"So the Lord and King speaks. He says, “Look! I am laying a stone in Zion. It is a stone that has been tested. It is the most important stone for a firm foundation. The one who depends on that stone will never be shaken."
Isaiah,28,17,I will use a measuring line to prove that you have not been fair. I will use a plumb line to prove that you have not done what is right. Hail will sweep away the lies you depend on to keep you safe. Water will flood your hiding place.
Isaiah,28,18,"Your covenant with death will be called off. The agreement you made with the place of the dead will not stand. When the terrible plague comes to punish you, you will be struck down by it."
Isaiah,28,19,"As often as it comes, it will carry you away. Morning after morning, day and night, it will come to punish you.” If you understand this message, it will bring you absolute terror."
Isaiah,28,20,You will be like someone whose bed is too short to lie down on. You will be like those whose blankets are too small to wrap themselves in.
Isaiah,28,21,"The Lord will rise up to judge, just as he did at Mount Perazim. He will get up to act, just as he did in the Valley of Gibeon. He’ll do his work, but it will be strange work. He’ll carry out his task, but it will be an unexpected one."
Isaiah,28,22,"Now stop making fun of me. If you don’t, your chains will become heavier. The Lord who rules over all has spoken to me. The Lord has told me he has ordered that the whole land be destroyed."
Isaiah,28,23,Listen and hear my voice. Pay attention to what I’m saying.
Isaiah,28,24,"When a farmer plows in order to plant, does he plow without stopping? Does he keep on breaking up the soil and making the field level?"
Isaiah,28,25,"When he’s made the surface even, doesn’t he plant caraway seeds? Doesn’t he scatter cumin seeds? Doesn’t he plant wheat in its proper place? Doesn’t he plant barley where it belongs? Doesn’t he plant spelt along the edge of the field?"
Isaiah,28,26,His God directs him. He teaches him the right way to do his work.
Isaiah,28,27,Caraway seeds are beaten out with a rod. They aren’t separated out under a threshing sled. Cumin seeds are beaten out with a stick. The wheel of a cart isn’t rolled over them.
Isaiah,28,28,Grain must be ground up to make bread. A farmer separates it out. But he doesn’t go on doing it forever. He drives the wheels of a threshing cart over it. But he doesn’t use horses to grind the grain.
Isaiah,28,29,All these insights come from the Lord who rules over all. His advice is wonderful. His wisdom is glorious.
Isaiah,29,1,"Jerusalem, how terrible it will be for you! Ariel, you are the city where David made his home. The years will come and go. Keep on celebrating your regular feasts."
Isaiah,29,2,"The Lord says, “Ariel, I will surround you. Jerusalem, I will get ready to attack you. Your people will mourn. They will sing songs of sadness. I will make you like the front of an altar covered with blood."
Isaiah,29,3,I will be like an army camped against you on all sides. I will surround you with towers in order to attack you. I will build my ramps all around you and set up my ladders.
Isaiah,29,4,You will be brought down to the grave. You will speak from deep down inside the ground. Your words will be barely heard out of the dust. Your voice will sound like the voice of a ghost coming from under the ground. Your words will sound like a whisper out of the dust.”
Isaiah,29,5,"Jerusalem, all your enemies will become like fine dust. Their terrifying armies will become like straw that the wind blows away. All of a sudden, in an instant,"
Isaiah,29,6,"the Lord who rules over all will come. He will come with thunder, earthquakes and a lot of noise. He’ll bring windstorms and rainstorms with him. He’ll send a blazing fire that will burn up everything."
Isaiah,29,7,Armies from all the nations will fight against Ariel. They will attack it and its fort. They’ll surround it completely. But suddenly those armies will disappear like a dream. They will vanish like a vision in the night.
Isaiah,29,8,"It will be as when a hungry person dreams of eating, but wakes up still hungry. It will be as when a thirsty person dreams of drinking, but wakes up weak and still thirsty. In the same way, the armies from all the nations that fight against Mount Zion will disappear."
Isaiah,29,9,"People of Jerusalem, be shocked and amazed. Make yourselves blind so you can’t see anything. Get drunk, but not from wine. Be unsteady on your feet, but not because of beer."
Isaiah,29,10,The Lord has made you fall into a deep sleep. He has closed the eyes of your prophets. He has covered the heads of your seers so they can’t see.
Isaiah,29,11,"For you, this whole vision is like words that are sealed up in a scroll. Suppose you give it to someone who can read. And suppose you say, “Please read this for us.” Then they’ll answer, “I can’t. It’s sealed up.”"
Isaiah,29,12,"Or suppose you give the scroll to someone who can’t read. And suppose you say, “Please read this for us.” Then they’ll answer, “I don’t know how to read.”"
Isaiah,29,13,"The Lord says, “These people worship me only with their words. They honor me by what they say. But their hearts are far away from me. Their worship doesn’t mean anything to me. They teach nothing but human rules that they have been taught."
Isaiah,29,14,So once more I will shock these people with many wonderful acts. I will destroy the wisdom of those who think they are so wise. I will do away with the cleverness of those who think they are so smart.”
Isaiah,29,15,"How terrible it will be for people who try hard to hide their plans from the Lord! They do their work in darkness. They think, “Who sees us? Who will know?”"
Isaiah,29,16,"They turn everything upside down. How silly they are to think that potters are like the clay they work with! Can what is made say to the one who made it, “You didn’t make me”? Can the pot say to the potter, “You don’t know anything”?"
Isaiah,29,17,"In a very short time, Lebanon will be turned into rich farm lands. The rich farm lands will seem like a forest."
Isaiah,29,18,At that time those who can’t hear will hear what is read from the scroll. Those who are blind will come out of gloom and darkness. They will be able to see.
Isaiah,29,19,Those who aren’t proud will once again find their joy in the Lord. And those who are in need will find their joy in the Holy One of Israel.
Isaiah,29,20,Those who don’t show any pity will vanish. Those who make fun of others will disappear. All those who look for ways to do what is evil will be cut off.
Isaiah,29,21,"Without any proof, they claim that a person is guilty. In court they try to trap the one who speaks up for others. By using dishonest witnesses they keep people who aren’t guilty from being treated fairly."
Isaiah,29,22,"Long ago the Lord saved Abraham from trouble. Now he says to Jacob’s people, “You will not be ashamed anymore. Your faces will no longer grow pale with fear."
Isaiah,29,23,You will see your children living among you. I myself will give you those children. Then you will honor my name. You will recognize how holy I am. I am the Holy One of Jacob. You will have great respect for me. I am the God of Israel.
Isaiah,29,24,I will give understanding to you who find yourselves going astray. You who are always speaking against others will accept what I teach you.”
Isaiah,30,1,“How terrible it will be for these stubborn children of mine!” announces the Lord. “How terrible for those who carry out plans that did not come from me! Their agreement with Egypt did not come from my Spirit. So they pile up one sin on top of another.
Isaiah,30,2,They go down to Egypt without asking me for advice. They look to Pharaoh to help them. They ask Egypt to keep them safe.
Isaiah,30,3,But looking to Pharaoh will only bring them shame. Asking Egypt for help will bring them dishonor.
Isaiah,30,4,Their officials have gone to the city of Zoan. Their messengers have arrived in Hanes.
Isaiah,30,5,"But the people of Judah will be put to shame. That’s because they are trusting in a nation that is useless to them. Egypt will not bring them any help or advantage. Instead, it will bring them shame and dishonor.”"
Isaiah,30,6,Here is a prophecy the Lord gave me about the animals in the Negev Desert. Judah’s messengers carry their riches on the backs of donkeys. They carry their treasures on the humps of camels. They travel through a land of danger and suffering. It’s a land filled with lions. Poisonous snakes are also there. The messengers travel to a nation that can’t do them any good.
Isaiah,30,7,"They travel to Egypt, whose help is totally useless. That’s why I call it Rahab the Do-Nothing."
Isaiah,30,8,"The Lord said to me, “Go now. Write on a tablet for the people of Judah what I am about to say. Also write it on a scroll. In days to come it will be a witness that lasts forever."
Isaiah,30,9,That’s because these people of Judah refuse to obey me. They are children who tell lies. They will not listen to what I want to teach them.
Isaiah,30,10,"They say to the seers, ‘Don’t see any more visions!’ They say to the prophets, ‘Don’t give us any more visions of what is right! Tell us pleasant things. Prophesy things we want to hear even if they aren’t true."
Isaiah,30,11,Get out of our way! Get off our path! Keep the Holy One of Israel away from us!’ ”
Isaiah,30,12,"So the Holy One of Israel speaks. He says, “You have turned your backs on what I have said. You have depended on telling people lies. You have crushed others."
Isaiah,30,13,Those sins are like cracks in a high wall. They get bigger and bigger. Suddenly the wall breaks apart. Then it quickly falls down.
Isaiah,30,14,It breaks into small pieces like a clay pot. It breaks up completely. Not one piece is left big enough for taking coals from a fireplace. Not one piece is left for dipping water out of a well.”
Isaiah,30,15,"The Lord and King is the Holy One of Israel. He says, “You will find peace and rest when you turn away from your sins and depend on me. You will receive the strength you need when you stay calm and trust in me. But you do not want to do what I tell you to."
Isaiah,30,16,"You said, ‘No. We’ll escape on horses.’ So you will have to escape! You said, ‘We’ll ride off on fast horses.’ So those who chase you will use faster horses!"
Isaiah,30,17,"When one of them dares you to fight, a thousand of you will run away. When five of them dare you, all of you will run away. So few of you will be left that you will be like a flagpole on top of a mountain. You will be like only one banner on a hill.”"
Isaiah,30,18,But the Lord wants to have mercy on you. So he will rise up to give you his tender love. The Lord is a God who is always fair. Blessed are all those who wait for him to act!
Isaiah,30,19,"People of Zion, who live in Jerusalem, you won’t weep anymore. When you cry out to the Lord for help, he will have mercy on you. As soon as he hears you, he’ll answer you."
Isaiah,30,20,He might treat you like prisoners. You might eat the bread of trouble. You might drink the water of suffering. But he will be your Teacher. He won’t hide himself anymore. You will see him with your own eyes.
Isaiah,30,21,"You will hear your Teacher’s voice behind you. You will hear it whether you turn to the right or the left. It will say, “Here is the path I want you to take. So walk on it.”"
Isaiah,30,22,"Then you will get rid of the silver statues of your gods. You won’t have anything to do with the gold statues either. All of them are “unclean.” So you will throw them away like dirty rags. You will say to them, “Get away from us!”"
Isaiah,30,23,The Lord will send rain on the seeds you plant in the ground. The crops that grow will be rich and plentiful. At that time your cattle will eat grass in rolling meadows.
Isaiah,30,24,The oxen and donkeys that work the soil will eat the finest feed and crushed grain. The farmers will use pitchforks and shovels to separate it from the straw.
Isaiah,30,25,At that time the towers of your enemies will fall down. Their soldiers will die. Streams of water will flow on every high mountain and hill.
Isaiah,30,26,The moon will shine like the sun. And the sunlight will be seven times brighter than usual. It will be like the light of seven full days. That will happen when the Lord bandages and heals the wounds and bruises he has brought on his people.
Isaiah,30,27,The Lord will come from far away in all his power and glory. He will show his burning anger. Thick clouds of smoke will be all around him. His mouth will speak angry words. The words from his tongue will be like a destroying fire.
Isaiah,30,28,His breath will be like a rushing flood that rises up to the neck. He’ll separate out the nations he is going to destroy. He’ll place a bit in their jaws. It will lead them down the road to death.
Isaiah,30,29,You will sing as you do on the night you celebrate a holy feast. Your hearts will be filled with joy. You will be as joyful as people playing their flutes as they go up to the mountain of the Lord. He is the Rock of Israel.
Isaiah,30,30,"The Lord will cause people to hear his powerful voice. He will make them see his arm coming down to punish them. It will come down with burning anger and destroying fire. It will come down with rain, thunderstorms and hail."
Isaiah,30,31,The voice of the Lord will tear the Assyrians apart. He will strike them down with his scepter.
Isaiah,30,32,"He will strike them with his club to punish them. Each time he does, his people will celebrate with the music of harps and tambourines. He will use his powerful arm to strike down the Assyrians in battle."
Isaiah,30,33,"In the Valley of Ben Hinnom, Topheth has been prepared for a long time. It has been made ready for the king of Assyria. Its fire pit has been made deep and wide. It has plenty of wood for the fire. The breath of the Lord will be like a stream of burning sulfur. It will set the wood on fire."
Isaiah,31,1,How terrible it will be for those who go down to Egypt for help! How terrible for those who depend on horses! They trust in how many chariots they have. They trust in how strong their horsemen are. But they don’t look to the Holy One of Israel. They don’t ask the Lord for his help.
Isaiah,31,2,He too is wise. He can bring horrible trouble. He does what he says he’ll do. He’ll rise up against that evil nation. He’ll fight against those who help them.
Isaiah,31,3,The men of Egypt are only human beings. They aren’t God. Their horses are only flesh and blood. They aren’t spirits. The Lord will reach out his powerful hand to punish everyone. The Egyptians provide help. But they will be tripped up. The people of Judah receive the help. But they will fall down. All of them will be destroyed.
Isaiah,31,4,"The Lord says to me, “A powerful lion stands over its food and growls. A lot of shepherds can be brought together to drive it away. But the lion is not frightened by their shouts. It is not upset by the noise they make. In the same way, I will come down from heaven. I will fight on Mount Zion and on its hills. Nothing will drive me away. I am the Lord who rules over all."
Isaiah,31,5,"Like a bird hovering over its nest, I will guard Jerusalem. I will keep it safe. I will ‘pass over’ it and save it. I am the Lord who rules over all.”"
Isaiah,31,6,"People of Israel, return to the Lord . He’s the God you have so strongly opposed."
Isaiah,31,7,You sinned when you made your gods out of silver and gold. The time will come when all of you will turn away from them.
Isaiah,31,8,"The Lord says, “The Assyrians will be killed by swords. But the swords that kill them will not be used by human beings. The Assyrians will run away from those swords. But their young men will be caught and forced to work hard."
Isaiah,31,9,"Their hiding places will be destroyed when terror strikes them. Their commanders will see their enemy’s battle flags. Then they will be filled with panic,” announces the Lord. His fire blazes out from Mount Zion. His furnace burns in Jerusalem."
Isaiah,32,1,A king will come who will do what is right. His officials will govern fairly.
Isaiah,32,2,Each official will be like a place to get out of the wind. He will be like a place to hide from storms. He’ll be like streams of water flowing in the desert. He’ll be like the shadow of a huge rock in a dry and thirsty land.
Isaiah,32,3,Then the eyes of those who see won’t be closed anymore. The ears of those who hear will listen to the truth.
Isaiah,32,4,People who are afraid will know and understand. Tongues that stutter will speak clearly.
Isaiah,32,5,Foolish people won’t be considered noble anymore. Those who are worthless won’t be highly respected.
Isaiah,32,6,Foolish people say foolish things. Their minds are set on doing evil things. They don’t do what is right. They tell lies about the Lord. They don’t give hungry people any food. They don’t let thirsty people have any water.
Isaiah,32,7,Those who are worthless use sinful methods. They make evil plans against poor people. They destroy them with their lies. They do it even when those people are right.
Isaiah,32,8,But those who are noble make noble plans. And by doing noble things they succeed.
Isaiah,32,9,"You women who are so contented, pay attention to me. You who feel so secure, listen to what I have to say."
Isaiah,32,10,You feel secure now. But in a little over a year you will tremble with fear. The grape harvest will fail. There won’t be any fruit.
Isaiah,32,11,"So tremble, you contented women. Tremble with fear, you who feel so secure. Take off your fine clothes. Wrap yourselves in rags."
Isaiah,32,12,Beat your chests to show how sad you are. The pleasant fields have been destroyed. The fruitful vines have dried up.
Isaiah,32,13,My people’s land is overgrown with thorns and bushes. Mourn for all the houses that were once filled with joy. Cry over this city that used to be full of wild parties.
Isaiah,32,14,The royal palace will be left empty. The noisy city will be deserted. The fort and lookout tower will become a dry and empty desert forever. Donkeys will enjoy being there. Flocks will eat there.
Isaiah,32,15,That will continue until the Holy Spirit is poured out on us from heaven. Then the desert will be turned into rich farm lands. The rich farm lands will seem like a forest.
Isaiah,32,16,"In the desert, the Lord will make sure people do what is right. In the rich farm lands he will make sure they treat one another fairly."
Isaiah,32,17,"Doing what is right will bring peace and rest. When my people do that, they will stay calm and trust in the Lord forever."
Isaiah,32,18,They will live in a peaceful land. Their homes will be secure. They will enjoy peace and quiet.
Isaiah,32,19,Hail might strip the forests bare. Cities might be completely destroyed.
Isaiah,32,20,But how blessed you people will be! You will plant your seeds by every stream. You will let your cattle and donkeys wander anywhere they want to.
Isaiah,33,1,"How terrible it will be for you, you who destroy others! Assyria, you haven’t been destroyed yet. How terrible for you, you who turn against others! Others haven’t turned against you yet. When you stop destroying, you will be destroyed. When you stop turning against others, others will turn against you."
Isaiah,33,2," Lord , have mercy on us. We long for you to help us. Make us strong every morning. Save us when we’re in trouble."
Isaiah,33,3,"At the roar of your army, the nations run away. When you rise up against them, they scatter."
Isaiah,33,4,"Nations, what you have taken in battle is destroyed. It’s as if young locusts had eaten it up. Like large numbers of locusts, people rush to get it."
Isaiah,33,5,The Lord is honored. He lives in heaven. He will make sure Zion’s people only do what is fair and right.
Isaiah,33,6,"He will be the firm foundation for their entire lives. He will give them all the wisdom, knowledge and saving power they will ever need. Respect for the Lord is the key to that treasure."
Isaiah,33,7,Look! Judah’s brave men cry out loud in the streets. The messengers who were sent to bring peace weep bitter tears.
Isaiah,33,8,The wide roads are deserted. No one travels on them. Our peace treaty with Assyria is broken. Those who witnessed it are looked down on. No one is respected.
Isaiah,33,9,The land dries up and wastes away. Lebanon is full of shame and dries up. The rich land of Sharon is like the Arabah Desert. The trees of Bashan and Carmel drop their leaves.
Isaiah,33,10,"“Now I will take action,” says the Lord. “Now I will be honored. Now I will be respected."
Isaiah,33,11,"Assyria, your plans and actions are like straw. Your anger is a fire that will destroy you."
Isaiah,33,12,The nations will be burned to ashes. They will be like bushes that are cut down and set on fire.
Isaiah,33,13,"“You nations far away, listen to what I have done! My people who are near, recognize how powerful I am!"
Isaiah,33,14,"The sinners in Zion are terrified. They tremble with fear. They say, ‘Who of us can live through the Lord ’s destroying fire? Who of us can live through the fire that burns forever?’"
Isaiah,33,15,People must do what is right. They must be honest and tell the truth. They must not get rich by cheating others. Their hands must not receive money from those who want special favors. They must not let their ears listen to plans to commit murder. They must close their eyes to even thinking about doing what is evil.
Isaiah,33,16,People like that will be kept safe. It will be as if they were living on high mountains. It will be as if they were living in a mountain fort. They will have all the food they need. And they will never run out of water.”
Isaiah,33,17,"People of Judah, you will see the king in all his glory and majesty. You will view his kingdom spreading far and wide."
Isaiah,33,18,"You will think about what used to terrify you. You will say to yourself, “Where is that chief officer of Assyria? Where is the one who forced us to send gifts to his king? Where is the officer in charge of the towers that were used when we were attacked?”"
Isaiah,33,19,You won’t see those proud people anymore. They spoke a strange language. None of us could understand it.
Isaiah,33,20,Just look at Zion! It’s the city where we celebrate our regular feasts. Turn your eyes toward Jerusalem. It will be a peaceful place to live in. It will be like a tent that will never be moved. Its stakes will never be pulled up. None of its ropes will be broken.
Isaiah,33,21,There the Lord will be our Mighty One. It will be like a place of wide rivers and streams. No boat with oars will travel on them. No mighty ship will sail on them.
Isaiah,33,22,That’s because the Lord is our judge. The Lord gives us our law. The Lord is our king. He will save us.
Isaiah,33,23,The ropes on your ship hang loose. The mast isn’t very secure. The sail isn’t spread out. But the Lord will strike down the Assyrians. Then a large amount of goods will be taken from them and divided up. Even people who are disabled will carry off some of it.
Isaiah,33,24,"No one living in Zion will ever say again, “I’m sick.” And the sins of those who live there will be forgiven."
Isaiah,34,1,"Nations, come near and listen to me! Pay attention to what I’m about to say. Let the earth and everything in it listen. Let the world and everything that comes out of it pay attention."
Isaiah,34,2,The Lord is angry with all the nations. His anger is against all their armies. He will totally destroy them. He will have them killed.
Isaiah,34,3,Those who are killed won’t be buried. Their dead bodies will be thrown on the ground. They will stink. Their blood will cover the mountains.
Isaiah,34,4,All the stars in the sky will vanish. The heavens will be rolled up like a scroll. All the stars in the sky will fall like dried-up leaves from a vine. They will drop like wrinkled figs from a fig tree.
Isaiah,34,5,The sword of the Lord will finish its deadly work in the sky. Then it will come down to strike Edom. He will totally destroy that nation.
Isaiah,34,6,His sword will be red with blood. It will be covered with fat. The blood will flow like the blood of lambs and goats being sacrificed. The fat will be like the fat taken from the kidneys of rams. That’s because the Lord will offer a sacrifice in the city of Bozrah. He will kill many people in the land of Edom.
Isaiah,34,7,The people and their leaders will be killed like wild oxen and young bulls. Their land will be wet with their blood. The dust will be covered with their fat.
Isaiah,34,8,That’s because the Lord has set aside a day to pay Edom back. He has set aside a year to pay them back. He will pay them back for what they did to Zion.
Isaiah,34,9,The streams of Edom will be turned into tar. Its dust will be turned into blazing sulfur. Its land will become burning tar.
Isaiah,34,10,The fire will keep burning night and day. It can’t be put out. Its smoke will go up forever. Edom will lie empty for all time to come. No one will ever travel through it again.
Isaiah,34,11,The desert owl and screech owl will make it their home. The great owl and the raven will build their nests there. God will use his measuring line to show how completely Edom will be destroyed. He will use his plumb line to show how empty Edom will become.
Isaiah,34,12,Edom’s nobles won’t have anything left there that can be called a kingdom. All its princes will vanish.
Isaiah,34,13,Thorns will cover its forts. Bushes and weeds will cover its safest places. It will become a home for wild dogs. It will become a place where owls live.
Isaiah,34,14,Desert creatures will meet with hyenas. Wild goats will call out to each other. Night creatures will also lie down there. They will find places where they can rest.
Isaiah,34,15,Owls will make their nests and lay their eggs there. And they will hatch them. They will take care of their little ones under the shadow of their wings. Male and female falcons will also gather there.
Isaiah,34,16,Look in the book of the Lord . Here is what you will read there. None of those animals will be missing. Male and female alike will be there. The Lord himself has commanded it. And his Spirit will gather them together.
Isaiah,34,17,The Lord will decide what part of the land goes to each animal. Then he will give each one its share. It will belong to them forever. And they will live there for all time to come.
Isaiah,35,1,"The desert and the dry ground will be glad. The dry places will be full of joy. Flowers will grow there. Like the first crocus in the spring,"
Isaiah,35,2,the desert will bloom with flowers. It will be very glad and shout for joy. The glorious beauty of Lebanon will be given to it. It will be as beautiful as the rich lands of Carmel and Sharon. Everyone will see the glory of the Lord. They will see the beauty of our God.
Isaiah,35,3,Strengthen the hands of those who are weak. Help those whose knees give way.
Isaiah,35,4,"Say to those whose hearts are afraid, “Be strong and do not fear. Your God will come. He will pay your enemies back. He will come to save you.”"
Isaiah,35,5,Then the eyes of those who are blind will be opened. The ears of those who can’t hear will be unplugged.
Isaiah,35,6,Those who can’t walk will leap like a deer. And those who can’t speak will shout for joy. Water will pour out in dry places. Streams will flow in the desert.
Isaiah,35,7,"The burning sand will become a pool of water. The thirsty ground will become bubbling springs. In the places where wild dogs once lay down, tall grass and papyrus will grow."
Isaiah,35,8,A wide road will go through the land. It will be called the Way of Holiness. Only those who lead a holy life can use it. “Unclean” and foolish people can’t walk on it.
Isaiah,35,9,No lions will use it. No hungry wild animals will be on it. None of them will be there. Only people who have been set free will walk on it.
Isaiah,35,10,Those the Lord has saved will return to their land. They will sing as they enter the city of Zion. Joy that lasts forever will be like beautiful crowns on their heads. They will be filled with gladness and joy. Sorrow and sighing will be gone.
Isaiah,36,1,Sennacherib attacked and captured all the cities of Judah that had high walls around them. It was in the 14th year of the rule of Hezekiah. Sennacherib was king of Assyria.
Isaiah,36,2,He sent his field commander from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. He sent him along with a large army. The commander stopped at the channel that brings water from the Upper Pool. It was on the road to the Washerman’s Field.
Isaiah,36,3,"Eliakim, Shebna and Joah went out to him. Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, was in charge of the palace. Shebna was the secretary. Joah, the son of Asaph, kept the records."
Isaiah,36,4,"The field commander said to them, “Give Hezekiah this message. Tell him, “ ‘Sennacherib is the great king of Assyria. He says, “Why are you putting your faith in what your king says?"
Isaiah,36,5,You say you have a military plan. You say you have a strong army. But your words don’t mean anything. Who are you depending on? Why don’t you want to stay under my control?
Isaiah,36,6,"Look, I know you are depending on Egypt. Why are you doing that? Egypt is nothing but a broken papyrus stem. Try leaning on it. It will only cut your hand. Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, is just like that to everyone who depends on him."
Isaiah,36,7,"But suppose you say to me, ‘We are depending on the Lord our God.’ Didn’t Hezekiah remove your god’s high places and altars? Didn’t Hezekiah say to the people of Judah and Jerusalem, ‘You must worship at the altar in Jerusalem’?"
Isaiah,36,8,"“ ‘ “Come on. Make a deal with my master, the king of Assyria. I’ll give you 2,000 horses. But only if you can put riders on them!"
Isaiah,36,9,You are depending on Egypt for chariots and horsemen. You can’t drive away even the least important officer among my master’s officials.
Isaiah,36,10,"Besides, do you think I’ve come without being sent by the Lord ? Have I come to attack and destroy this land without receiving a message from him? The Lord himself told me to march out against your country. He told me to destroy it.” ’ ”"
Isaiah,36,11,"Then Eliakim, Shebna and Joah spoke to the field commander. They said, “Please speak to us in the Aramaic language. We understand it. Don’t speak to us in Hebrew. If you do, the people on the wall will be able to understand you.”"
Isaiah,36,12,"But the commander replied, “My master sent me to say these things. Are these words only for your master and you to hear? Aren’t they also for the people sitting on the wall? They are going to suffer just like you. They’ll have to eat their own waste. They’ll have to drink their own urine.”"
Isaiah,36,13,"Then the commander stood up and spoke in the Hebrew language. He called out, “Pay attention to what the great king of Assyria is telling you."
Isaiah,36,14,"He says, ‘Don’t let Hezekiah trick you. He can’t save you!"
Isaiah,36,15,"Don’t let Hezekiah talk you into trusting in the Lord . Don’t believe him when he says, “You can be sure that the Lord will save us. This city will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.” ’"
Isaiah,36,16,"“Don’t listen to Hezekiah. The king of Assyria says, ‘Make a peace treaty with me. Come over to my side. Then each one of you will eat fruit from your own vine and fig tree. Each one of you will drink water from your own well."
Isaiah,36,17,You will do that until I come back. Then I’ll take you to a land just like yours. It’s a land that has a lot of grain and fresh wine. It has plenty of bread and vineyards.
Isaiah,36,18,"“ ‘Don’t let Hezekiah fool you. He’s telling you a lie when he says, “The Lord will save us.” Have the gods of any nations ever saved their lands from the power of the king of Assyria?"
Isaiah,36,19,Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they saved Samaria from my power?
Isaiah,36,20,Which one of all the gods of those countries has been able to save their lands from me? So how can the Lord save Jerusalem from my power?’ ”
Isaiah,36,21,"But the people remained silent. They didn’t say anything. That’s because King Hezekiah had commanded, “Don’t answer him.”"
Isaiah,36,22,"Then Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, went to Hezekiah. Eliakim was in charge of the palace. Shebna the secretary went with him. So did Joah, the son of Asaph. Joah kept the records. All of them went to Hezekiah with their clothes torn. They told him what the field commander had said."
Isaiah,37,1,"When King Hezekiah heard what the field commander had said, he tore his clothes. He put on the rough clothing people wear when they’re sad. Then he went into the Lord ’s temple."
Isaiah,37,2,"Hezekiah sent Eliakim, who was in charge of the palace, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz. He also sent the leading priests and Shebna the secretary to him. All of them were wearing rough clothing."
Isaiah,37,3,"They told Isaiah, “Hezekiah says, ‘Today we’re in great trouble. The Lord is warning us. He’s bringing shame on us. Sometimes babies come to the moment when they should be born. But their mothers aren’t strong enough to give birth to them. Today we are like those mothers. We aren’t strong enough to save ourselves."
Isaiah,37,4,"Perhaps the Lord your God will hear everything the field commander has said. His master, the king of Assyria, has sent him to make fun of the living God. Maybe the Lord your God will punish him for what he has heard him say. So pray for the remaining people who are still alive here.’ ”"
Isaiah,37,5,King Hezekiah’s officials came to Isaiah.
Isaiah,37,6,"Then he said to them, “Tell your master, ‘The Lord says, “Do not be afraid of what you have heard. The officers who are under the king of Assyria have spoken evil things against me."
Isaiah,37,7,Listen! I will send him news from his own country. It will make him want to return home. There I will have him cut down by a sword.” ’ ”
Isaiah,37,8,The field commander heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish. So the commander pulled his troops back from Jerusalem. He went to join the king. He found out that the king was fighting against Libnah.
Isaiah,37,9,"During that time Sennacherib received a report. He was told that Tirhakah was marching out to fight against him. Tirhakah was the king of Cush. When Sennacherib heard the report, he sent messengers again to Hezekiah with a letter. It said,"
Isaiah,37,10,"“Tell Hezekiah, the king of Judah, ‘Don’t let the god you depend on trick you. He says, “Jerusalem will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.” But don’t believe him."
Isaiah,37,11,I’m sure you have heard about what the kings of Assyria have done to all the other countries. They have destroyed them completely. So do you think you will be saved?
Isaiah,37,12,"The kings who ruled before me destroyed many nations. Did the gods of those nations save them? Did the gods of Gozan, Harran or Rezeph save them? What about the gods of the people of Eden who were in Tel Assar?"
Isaiah,37,13,"Where is the king of Hamath? Where is the king of Arpad? Where are the kings of Lair, Sepharvaim, Hena and Ivvah?’ ”"
Isaiah,37,14,"When Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers, he read it. Then he went up to the Lord ’s temple. There he spread the letter out in front of the Lord."
Isaiah,37,15,"Hezekiah prayed to the Lord . He said,"
Isaiah,37,16,"“ Lord who rules over all, you are the God of Israel. You sit on your throne between the cherubim. You alone are God over all the kingdoms on earth. You have made heaven and earth."
Isaiah,37,17,"Listen, Lord . Hear us. Open your eyes, Lord . Look at the trouble we’re in. Listen to what Sennacherib is saying. You are the living God. And he dares to make fun of you!"
Isaiah,37,18,"“ Lord , it’s true that the kings of Assyria have completely destroyed many nations and their lands."
Isaiah,37,19,They have thrown the statues of the gods of those nations into the fire. And they have destroyed them. That’s because they weren’t really gods at all. They were nothing but statues made out of wood and stone. They were made by human hands.
Isaiah,37,20,"Lord our God, save us from the power of Sennacherib. Then all the kingdoms of the earth will know that you are the only God.”"
Isaiah,37,21,"Isaiah sent a message to Hezekiah. Isaiah said, “The Lord is the God of Israel. He says, ‘You have prayed to me about Sennacherib, the king of Assyria."
Isaiah,37,22,"So here is the message the Lord has spoken against him. The Lord is telling him, “ ‘ “You will not win the battle over Zion. Its people hate you and make fun of you. The people of Jerusalem lift up their heads proudly as you run away."
Isaiah,37,23,Who have you laughed at? Who have you spoken evil things against? Who have you raised your voice against? Who have you looked at so proudly? You have done it against me. I am the Holy One of Israel!
Isaiah,37,24,"Through your messengers you have laughed at me again and again. And you have said, ‘I have many chariots. With them I have climbed to the tops of the mountains. I’ve climbed the highest mountains in Lebanon. I’ve cut down its tallest cedar trees. I’ve cut down the best of its juniper trees. I’ve reached its farthest mountains. I’ve reached its finest forests."
Isaiah,37,25,I’ve dug wells in other lands. I’ve drunk the water from them. I’ve walked through all the streams of Egypt. I’ve dried up every one of them.’
Isaiah,37,26,"“ ‘ “But I, the Lord , say, ‘Haven’t you heard what I have done? Long ago I arranged for you to do this. In days of old I planned it. Now I have made it happen. You have turned cities with high walls into piles of stone."
Isaiah,37,27,Their people do not have any power left. They are troubled and put to shame. They are like plants in the field. They are like new green plants. They are like grass that grows on a roof. It dries up before it is completely grown.
Isaiah,37,28,“ ‘ “ ‘But I know where you are. I know when you come and go. I know how very angry you are with me.
Isaiah,37,29,You roar against me and brag. And I have heard your bragging. So I will put my hook in your nose. I will put my bit in your mouth. And I will make you go home by the same way you came.’ ” ’ ”
Isaiah,37,30,"The Lord said, “Hezekiah, here is a sign for you. “This year you will eat what grows by itself. Next year you will eat what grows from that. But in the third year you will plant your crops and gather them in. You will plant your grapevines and eat their fruit."
Isaiah,37,31,The people of the kingdom of Judah who are still alive will be like plants. Once more they will put down roots and produce fruit.
Isaiah,37,32,Out of Jerusalem will come the people who remain. Out of Mount Zion will come those who are still left alive. My great love will make sure that happens. I rule over all.
Isaiah,37,33,"“Here is a message from me about the king of Assyria. I say, “ ‘He will not enter this city. He will not even shoot an arrow at it. He will not come near it with a shield. He will not build a ramp in order to climb over its walls."
Isaiah,37,34,"By the way that he came he will go home. He will not enter this city,’ announces the Lord."
Isaiah,37,35,‘I will guard this city and save it. I will do it for myself. And I will do it for my servant David.’ ”
Isaiah,37,36,"Then the angel of the Lord went into the camp of the Assyrians. He put to death 185,000 soldiers there. The people of Jerusalem got up the next morning. They looked out and saw all the dead bodies."
Isaiah,37,37,"So Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, took the army tents down. Then he left. He returned to Nineveh and stayed there."
Isaiah,37,38,One day Sennacherib was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisrok. His sons Adrammelek and Sharezer killed him with their swords. Then they escaped to the land of Ararat. Esarhaddon became the next king after his father Sennacherib.
Isaiah,38,1,"In those days Hezekiah became very sick. He knew he was about to die. Isaiah went to see him. Isaiah was the son of Amoz. Isaiah told Hezekiah, “The Lord says, ‘Put everything in order. Make out your will. You are going to die soon. You will not get well again.’ ”"
Isaiah,38,2,"Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall. He prayed to the Lord . He said,"
Isaiah,38,3,"“ Lord , please remember how faithful I’ve been to you. I’ve lived the way you wanted me to. I’ve served you with all my heart. I’ve done what is good in your sight.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly."
Isaiah,38,4,"A message from the Lord came to Isaiah. The Lord said,"
Isaiah,38,5,"“Go and speak to Hezekiah. Tell him, ‘The Lord , the God of King David, says, “I have heard your prayer. I have seen your tears. I will add 15 years to your life."
Isaiah,38,6,And I will save you and this city from the power of the king of Assyria. I will guard this city.
Isaiah,38,7,"“ ‘ “Here is a sign from me. It will show you that I will heal you, just as I promised I would."
Isaiah,38,8,The shadow that was made by the sun has gone down ten steps on the stairway of Ahaz. I will make it go back up those ten steps.” ’ ” So the shadow went back up the ten steps it had gone down.
Isaiah,38,9,"Here is a song of praise that was written by Hezekiah, the king of Judah. He wrote it after he was sick and had gotten well again."
Isaiah,38,10,"I said, “I’m enjoying the best years of my life. Must I now go through the gates of death? Will the rest of my years be taken away from me?”"
Isaiah,38,11,"I said, “ Lord , I’ll never see you again while I’m still alive. I’ll never see people anymore. I’ll never again be with those who live in this world."
Isaiah,38,12,My body is like a shepherd’s tent. It has been pulled down and carried off. My life is like a piece of cloth that I’ve rolled up. You have cut it off from the loom. In a short period of time you have brought my life to an end.
Isaiah,38,13,I waited patiently until sunrise. But like a lion you broke all my bones. In a short period of time you have brought my life to an end.
Isaiah,38,14,"I cried softly like a weak little bird. I sounded like a dove as I mourned. My eyes grew tired as I looked up toward heaven. Lord, my life is in danger. Please come and help me!"
Isaiah,38,15,“But what can I say? You have promised to heal me. And you yourself have done it. Once I was proud and bitter. But now I will live the rest of my life free of pride.
Isaiah,38,16,"Lord, people find the will to live because you keep your promises. And my spirit also finds life in your promises. You brought me back to health. You let me live."
Isaiah,38,17,I’m sure it was for my benefit that I suffered such great pain. You love me. You kept me from going down into the pit of death. You have put all my sins behind your back.
Isaiah,38,18,People in the grave can’t praise you. Dead people can’t sing praise to you. Those who go down to the grave can’t hope for you to be faithful to them.
Isaiah,38,19,It is those who are alive who praise you. And that’s what I’m doing today. Parents tell their children about how faithful you are.
Isaiah,38,20,“The Lord will save me. So we will sing and play music on stringed instruments. We will sing all the days of our lives in the Lord ’s temple.”
Isaiah,38,21,"When Hezekiah was sick, Isaiah had said, “Press some figs together. Spread them on a piece of cloth. Apply them to Hezekiah’s boil. Then he’ll get well again.”"
Isaiah,38,22,"At that time Hezekiah had asked, “What will the sign be to prove I’ll go up to the Lord ’s temple?” That’s when the Lord had made the shadow go back ten steps."
Isaiah,39,1,"At that time Marduk-Baladan, the king of Babylon, sent Hezekiah letters and a gift. He had heard that Hezekiah had been sick but had gotten well again. Marduk-Baladan was the son of Baladan."
Isaiah,39,2,"Hezekiah gladly received the messengers. He showed them what was in his storerooms. He showed them the silver and gold. He took them to where the spices and the fine olive oil were kept. He showed them where he kept all his weapons. And he showed them all his treasures. In fact, he showed them everything that was in his palace and in his whole kingdom."
Isaiah,39,3,"Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah. Isaiah asked him, “What did those men say? Where did they come from?” “They came from a land far away,” Hezekiah said. “They came to me from Babylon.”"
Isaiah,39,4,"Isaiah asked, “What did they see in your palace?” “They saw everything in my palace,” Hezekiah said. “I showed them all my treasures.”"
Isaiah,39,5,"Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Listen to the message of the Lord who rules over all. He says,"
Isaiah,39,6,"‘You can be sure the time will come when everything in your palace will be carried off to Babylon. Everything the kings before you have stored up until this day will be taken away. There will not be anything left,’ says the Lord."
Isaiah,39,7,‘Some of the members of your family line will be taken away. They will be your own flesh and blood. They will include the children who will be born into your family line. And they will serve the king of Babylon in his palace.’ ”
Isaiah,39,8,"“The message the Lord has spoken through you is good,” Hezekiah replied. He thought, “There will be peace and safety while I’m still living.”"
Isaiah,40,1,"“Comfort my people,” says your God. “Comfort them."
Isaiah,40,2,Speak tenderly to the people of Jerusalem. Announce to them that their hard labor has been completed. Tell them that their sin has been paid for. Tell them the Lord has punished them enough for all their sins.”
Isaiah,40,3,"A messenger is calling out, “In the desert prepare the way for the Lord. Make a straight road through it for our God."
Isaiah,40,4,Every valley will be filled in. Every mountain and hill will be made level. The rough ground will be smoothed out. The rocky places will be made flat.
Isaiah,40,5,Then the glory of the Lord will appear. And everyone will see it together. The Lord has spoken.”
Isaiah,40,6,"Another messenger says, “Cry out.” And I said, “What should I cry?” “Cry out, ‘All people are like grass. They don’t stay faithful to me any longer than wildflowers last."
Isaiah,40,7,The grass dries up. The flowers fall to the ground. That happens when the Lord makes his wind blow on them. So people are just like grass.
Isaiah,40,8,The grass dries up. The flowers fall to the ground. But what our God says will stand forever.’ ”
Isaiah,40,9,"Zion, you are bringing good news to your people. Go up on a high mountain and announce it. Jerusalem, you are bringing good news to them. Shout the message loudly. Shout it out loud. Don’t be afraid. Say to the towns of Judah, “Your God is coming!”"
Isaiah,40,10,The Lord and King is coming with power. He rules with a powerful arm. He has set his people free. He is bringing them back as his reward. He has won the battle over their enemies.
Isaiah,40,11,He takes care of his flock like a shepherd. He gathers the lambs in his arms. He carries them close to his heart. He gently leads those that have little ones.
Isaiah,40,12,Who has measured the oceans by using the palm of his hand? Who has used the width of his hand to mark off the sky? Who has measured out the dust of the earth in a basket? Who has weighed the mountains on scales? Who has weighed the hills in a balance?
Isaiah,40,13,Who can ever understand the Spirit of the Lord? Who can ever give him advice?
Isaiah,40,14,Did the Lord have to ask anyone to help him understand? Did he have to ask someone to teach him the right way? Who taught him what he knows? Who showed him how to understand?
Isaiah,40,15,The nations are only a drop in a bucket to him. He considers them as nothing but dust on the scales. He weighs the islands as if they were only fine dust.
Isaiah,40,16,Lebanon doesn’t have enough trees to keep his altar fires burning. It doesn’t have enough animals to sacrifice as burnt offerings to him.
Isaiah,40,17,"To him, all the nations don’t amount to anything. He considers them to be worthless. In fact, they are less than nothing in his sight."
Isaiah,40,18,So who will you compare God with? Is there any other god like him?
Isaiah,40,19,Will you compare him with a statue of a god? Anyone who works with metal can make a statue. Then another worker covers it with gold and makes silver chains for it.
Isaiah,40,20,But someone who is too poor to bring that kind of offering will choose some wood that won’t rot. Then they look for a skilled worker. They pay the worker to make a statue of a god that won’t fall over.
Isaiah,40,21,Don’t you know who made everything? Haven’t you heard about him? Hasn’t it been told to you from the beginning? Haven’t you understood it ever since the earth was made?
Isaiah,40,22,God sits on his throne high above the earth. Its people look like grasshoppers to him. He spreads out the heavens like a cover. He sets it up like a tent to live in.
Isaiah,40,23,He takes the power of princes away from them. He reduces the rulers of this world to nothing.
Isaiah,40,24,"They are planted. They are scattered like seeds. They put down roots in the ground. But as soon as that happens, God blows on them and they dry up. Then a windstorm sweeps them away like straw."
Isaiah,40,25,“So who will you compare me with? Who is equal to me?” says the Holy One.
Isaiah,40,26,Look up toward the sky. Who created everything you see? The Lord causes the stars to come out at night one by one. He calls out each one of them by name. His power and strength are great. So none of the stars is missing.
Isaiah,40,27,"Family of Jacob, why do you complain, “The Lord doesn’t notice our condition”? People of Israel, why do you say, “Our God doesn’t pay any attention to our rightful claims”?"
Isaiah,40,28,Don’t you know who made everything? Haven’t you heard about him? The Lord is the God who lives forever. He created everything on earth. He won’t become worn out or get tired. No one will ever know how great his understanding is.
Isaiah,40,29,He gives strength to those who are tired. He gives power to those who are weak.
Isaiah,40,30,Even young people become worn out and get tired. Even the best of them trip and fall.
Isaiah,40,31,But those who trust in the Lord will receive new strength. They will fly as high as eagles. They will run and not get tired. They will walk and not grow weak.
Isaiah,41,1,"The Lord says, “People who live on the islands, come and stand quietly in front of me. Let the nations gain new strength in order to state their case. Let them come forward and speak. Let us go to court and find out who is right."
Isaiah,41,2,“Who has stirred up a king from the east? Who has helped him win his battles? I hand nations over to him. I bring kings under his control. He turns them into dust with his sword. With his bow he turns them into straw blowing in the wind.
Isaiah,41,3,He hunts them down. Then he moves on unharmed. He travels so fast that his feet don’t seem to touch the ground.
Isaiah,41,4,"Who has made that happen? Who has carried it out? Who has created all the people who have ever lived? I, the Lord , have done it. I was with the first of them. And I will be with the last of them.”"
Isaiah,41,5,The people on the islands have seen that king coming. And it has made them afraid. People tremble with fear from one end of the earth to the other. They come and gather together.
Isaiah,41,6,"They help one another. They say to one another, “Be strong!”"
Isaiah,41,7,"One skilled worker makes a statue of a god. Another covers it with gold. The first worker says to the second, “You have done a good job.” Another worker smooths out the metal with a hammer. Still another gives the statue its final shape. The one who hammers says to the one who shapes, “You have done a good job.” Then they nail the statue down so it won’t fall over."
Isaiah,41,8,"The Lord says, “People of Israel, you are my servants. Family of Jacob, I have chosen you. You are the children of my friend Abraham."
Isaiah,41,9,"I gathered you from one end of the earth to the other. From the farthest places on earth I brought you together. I said, ‘You are my servants.’ I have chosen you. I have not turned my back on you."
Isaiah,41,10,So do not be afraid. I am with you. Do not be terrified. I am your God. I will make you strong and help you. I will hold you safe in my hands. I always do what is right.
Isaiah,41,11,“All those who are angry with you will be put to shame. And they will be dishonored. Those who oppose you will be destroyed. And they will vanish.
Isaiah,41,12,You might search for your enemies. But you will not find them. Those who go to war against you will completely disappear.
Isaiah,41,13,"I am the Lord your God. I take hold of your right hand. I say to you, ‘Do not be afraid. I will help you.’"
Isaiah,41,14,"Family of Jacob, you are as weak as a worm. But do not be afraid. People of Israel, there are only a few of you. But do not be afraid. I myself will help you,” announces the Lord. He is the one who sets his people free. He is the Holy One of Israel."
Isaiah,41,15,"He says, “I will make you into a threshing sled. It will be new and sharp. It will have many teeth. You will grind the mountains down and crush them. You will turn the hills into nothing but straw."
Isaiah,41,16,You will toss them in the air. A strong wind will catch them and blow them away. You will be glad because I will make that happen. You will praise me. I am the Holy One of Israel.
Isaiah,41,17,“Those who are poor and needy search for water. But there isn’t any. Their tongues are dry because they are thirsty. But I will help them. I am the Lord. I will not desert them. I am Israel’s God.
Isaiah,41,18,I will make streams flow on the bare hilltops. I will make springs come up in the valleys. I will turn the desert into pools of water. I will turn the dry and cracked ground into flowing springs.
Isaiah,41,19,I will make trees grow in the desert. I will plant cedar and acacia trees there. I will plant myrtle and olive trees there. I will make juniper trees grow in the dry and empty desert. I will plant fir and cypress trees there.
Isaiah,41,20,Then people will see and know that my powerful hand has done it. They will consider and understand that I have created it. I am the Holy One of Israel.”
Isaiah,41,21,"The Lord says to the nations and their gods, “State your case.” Jacob’s King says to them, “Prove your case to me."
Isaiah,41,22,"Tell us, you false gods, what is going to happen. Tell us what happened in the past. Then we can check it out and see if it is really true. Or announce to us the things that will take place."
Isaiah,41,23,Tell us what will happen in the days ahead. Then we will know that you are gods. Do something. It does not matter whether it is good or bad. Then we will be terrified and filled with fear.
Isaiah,41,24,But you false gods are less than nothing. Your actions are completely worthless. I hate it when people worship you.
Isaiah,41,25,“I have stirred up a king who will come from the north. He lives in the east. He will bring honor to me. He walks all over rulers as if they were mud. He steps on them just as a potter stomps on clay.
Isaiah,41,26,"Which one of you false gods said those things would happen before they did? Who told us about them so we could know them? Who told us ahead of time? Who told us so we could say, ‘You are right’? None of you false gods told us about them. None of you told us ahead of time. In fact, no one heard you say anything at all."
Isaiah,41,27,"I was the first to tell Zion. I said, ‘Look! The people of Israel are coming back!’ I sent a messenger to Jerusalem with the good news."
Isaiah,41,28,"I look, but there is no one among the gods that can give me advice. None of them can answer when I ask them the simplest question."
Isaiah,41,29,So they are not really gods at all. What they do does not amount to anything. They are as useless as wind.
Isaiah,42,1,“Here is my servant. I take good care of him. I have chosen him. I am very pleased with him. I will put my Spirit on him. He will bring justice to the nations.
Isaiah,42,2,He will not shout or cry out. He will not raise his voice in the streets.
Isaiah,42,3,He will not break a bent twig. He will not put out a dimly burning flame. He will be faithful and make everything right.
Isaiah,42,4,He will not grow weak or lose hope. He will not give up until he brings justice to the earth. The islands will put their hope in his teaching.”
Isaiah,42,5,"God created the heavens and stretches them out. The Lord spreads out the earth with everything that grows on it. He gives breath to its people. He gives life to those who walk on it. He says to his servant,"
Isaiah,42,6,"“I, the Lord , have chosen you to do what is right. I will take hold of your hand. I will keep you safe. You will put into effect my covenant with the people of Israel. And you will be a light for the Gentiles."
Isaiah,42,7,You will open eyes that can’t see. You will set prisoners free. Those who sit in darkness will come out of their cells.
Isaiah,42,8,“I am the Lord . That is my name! I will not let any other god share my glory. I will not let statues of gods share my praise.
Isaiah,42,9,"What I said would happen has taken place. Now I announce new things to you. Before they even begin to happen, I announce them to you.”"
Isaiah,42,10,"Sing a new song to the Lord. Sing praise to him from one end of the earth to the other. Sing, you who sail out on the ocean. Sing, all you creatures in it. Sing, you islands. Sing, all you who live there."
Isaiah,42,11,Let the desert and its towns raise their voices. Let those who live in the settlements of Kedar be glad. Let the people of Sela sing for joy. Let them shout from the tops of the mountains.
Isaiah,42,12,Let them give glory to the Lord. Let them praise him in the islands.
Isaiah,42,13,The Lord will march out like a mighty warrior. He will stir up his anger like a soldier getting ready to fight. He will shout the battle cry. And he will win the battle over his enemies.
Isaiah,42,14,"The Lord says, “For a long time I have kept silent. I have been calm and quiet. But now, like a woman having a baby, I cry out. I gasp and pant."
Isaiah,42,15,I will completely destroy the mountains and hills. I will dry up everything that grows there. I will turn rivers into dry land. I will dry up the pools.
Isaiah,42,16,Israel is blind. So I will lead them along paths they had not known before. I will guide them on roads they are not familiar with. I will turn the darkness into light as they travel. I will make the rough places smooth. Those are the things I will do. I will not desert my people.
Isaiah,42,17,"Some people trust in statues of gods. They say to them, ‘You are our gods.’ But they will be dishonored. They will be put to shame."
Isaiah,42,18,"“Israel, listen to me! You can hear, but you do not understand. Look to me! You can see, but you do not know what you are seeing."
Isaiah,42,19,The people of Israel serve me. But who is more blind than they are? Who is more deaf than the messengers I send? Who is more blind than the one who has promised to be faithful to me? Who is more blind than the servant of the Lord?
Isaiah,42,20,"Israel, you have seen many things. But you do not pay any attention to me. Your ears are open. But you do not listen to anything I say.”"
Isaiah,42,21,The Lord wanted his people to see how great and glorious his law is. He wanted to show them that he always does what is right.
Isaiah,42,22,"Enemies have carried off everything they own. All my people are trapped in pits or hidden away in prisons. They themselves have become like stolen goods. No one can save them. They have been carried off. And there is no one who will say, “Send them back.”"
Isaiah,42,23,"Family of Jacob, who among you will listen to what I’m saying? People of Israel, which one of you will pay close attention in days to come?"
Isaiah,42,24,"Who allowed you to be carried off like stolen goods? Who handed you over to robbers? The Lord did it! We have sinned against him. Israel, you wouldn’t follow his ways. You didn’t obey his law."
Isaiah,42,25,So he poured out his great anger on you. He had many of you killed in battle. You were surrounded by flames. But you didn’t realize what was happening. Many of you were destroyed. But you didn’t learn anything from it.
Isaiah,43,1,"Family of Jacob, the Lord created you. People of Israel, he formed you. He says, “Do not be afraid. I will set you free. I will send for you by name. You belong to me."
Isaiah,43,2,You will pass through deep waters. But I will be with you. You will pass through the rivers. But their waters will not sweep over you. You will walk through fire. But you will not be burned. The flames will not harm you.
Isaiah,43,3,I am the Lord your God. I am the Holy One of Israel. I am the one who saves you. I will give up Egypt to set you free. I will give up Cush and Seba for you.
Isaiah,43,4,You are priceless to me. I love you and honor you. So I will trade other people for you. I will give up other nations to save your lives.
Isaiah,43,5,Do not be afraid. I am with you. I will bring your people back from the east. I will gather you from the west.
Isaiah,43,6,"I will say to the north, ‘Let them go!’ And I will say to the south, ‘Do not hold them back.’ Bring my sons from far away. Bring my daughters from the farthest places on earth."
Isaiah,43,7,Bring back everyone who belongs to me. I created them to bring glory to me. I formed them and made them.”
Isaiah,43,8,Lead my people into court. They have eyes but can’t see. Bring those who have ears but can’t hear.
Isaiah,43,9,"All the nations are gathering together. All of them are coming. Which one of their gods said ahead of time that the people of Israel would return? Which of them told us anything at all about the past? Let them bring in their witnesses to prove they were right. Then others will hear them. And they will say, “What they said is true.”"
Isaiah,43,10,"“People of Israel, you are my witnesses,” announces the Lord. “I have chosen you to be my servant. I wanted you to know me and believe in me. I wanted you to understand that I am the one and only God. Before me, there was no other god at all. And there will not be any god after me."
Isaiah,43,11,I am the one and only Lord. I am the only one who can save you.
Isaiah,43,12,"I have made known what would happen. I saved you. I have told you about it. I did this. It was not some other god you worship. You are my witnesses that I am God,” announces the Lord."
Isaiah,43,13,"“And that is not all! I have always been God, and I always will be. No one can save people from my power. When I do something, who can undo it?”"
Isaiah,43,14,"The Lord sets his people free. He is the Holy One of Israel. He says, “People of Israel, I will send an army to Babylon to save you. I will cause all the Babylonians to run away. They will try to escape in the ships they were so proud of."
Isaiah,43,15,I am your Lord and King. I am your Holy One. I created you.”
Isaiah,43,16,Long ago the Lord opened a way for his people to go through the Red Sea. He made a path through the mighty waters.
Isaiah,43,17,"He caused Egypt to send out its chariots and horses. He sent its entire army to its death. Its soldiers lay down there. They never got up again. They were destroyed. They were blown out like a dimly burning flame. But the Lord says,"
Isaiah,43,18,“Forget the things that happened in the past. Do not keep on thinking about them.
Isaiah,43,19,I am about to do something new. It is beginning to happen even now. Don’t you see it coming? I am going to make a way for you to go through the desert. I will make streams of water in the dry and empty land.
Isaiah,43,20,Even wild dogs and owls honor me. That is because I provide water in the desert for my people to drink. I cause streams to flow in the dry and empty land for my chosen ones.
Isaiah,43,21,I do it for the people I made for myself. I want them to sing praise to me.
Isaiah,43,22,"“Family of Jacob, you have not prayed to me as you should. People of Israel, you have not worn yourselves out for me."
Isaiah,43,23,You have not brought me sheep for burnt offerings. You have not honored me with your sacrifices. I have not loaded you down by requiring grain offerings. I have not made you tired by requiring you to burn incense.
Isaiah,43,24,"But you have not bought any sweet-smelling cane for me. You have not given me the fattest parts of your animal sacrifices. Instead, you have loaded me down with your sins. You have made me tired with the wrong things you have done."
Isaiah,43,25,“I am the one who wipes out your lawless acts. I do it because of who I am. I will not remember your sins anymore.
Isaiah,43,26,But let us go to court together. Remind me of what you have done. State your case. Prove to me that you are not guilty.
Isaiah,43,27,Your father Jacob sinned. The people I sent to teach you refused to obey me.
Isaiah,43,28,So I put the high officials of your temple to shame. I let Jacob’s family be totally destroyed. And I let people make fun of Israel.
Isaiah,44,1,"“Family of Jacob, listen to me. You are my servant. People of Israel, I have chosen you."
Isaiah,44,2,"I made you. I formed you when you were born as a nation. I will help you. So listen to what I am saying. Family of Jacob, do not be afraid. You are my servant. People of Israel, I have chosen you."
Isaiah,44,3,I will pour out water on the thirsty land. I will make streams flow on the dry ground. I will pour out my Spirit on your children. I will pour out my blessing on their children after them.
Isaiah,44,4,They will spring up like grass in a meadow. They will grow like poplar trees near flowing streams.
Isaiah,44,5,"Some will say, ‘We belong to the Lord .’ Others will call themselves by Jacob’s name. Still others will write on their hands, ‘We belong to the Lord .’ And they will be called by the name of Israel."
Isaiah,44,6,“I am Israel’s King. I set them free. I am the Lord who rules over all. So listen to what I am saying. I am the first and the last. I am the one and only God.
Isaiah,44,7,Who is like me? Let him come forward and speak boldly. Let him tell me everything that has happened since I created my people long ago. And let him tell me what has not happened yet. Let him announce ahead of time what is going to take place.
Isaiah,44,8,Do not tremble with fear. Do not be afraid. Didn’t I announce everything that has happened? Didn’t I tell you about it long ago? You are my witnesses. Is there any other God but me? No! There is no other Rock. I do not know even one.”
Isaiah,44,9,Those who make statues of gods don’t amount to anything. And the statues they think so much of are worthless. Those who would speak up for them are blind. They don’t know anything. So they will be put to shame.
Isaiah,44,10,People make statues of gods. But those gods can’t do any good.
Isaiah,44,11,People who do that will be put to shame. Those who make statues of gods are mere human beings. Let all of them come together and state their case. They will be terrified and put to shame.
Isaiah,44,12,A blacksmith gets his tool. He uses it to shape metal over the burning coals. He uses his hammers to make a statue of a god. He forms it with his powerful arm. He gets hungry and loses his strength. He doesn’t drink any water. He gets weaker and weaker.
Isaiah,44,13,A carpenter measures a piece of wood with a line. He draws a pattern on it with a marker. He cuts out a statue with sharp tools. He marks it with compasses. He shapes it into the form of a beautiful human being. He does this so he can put it in a temple.
Isaiah,44,14,He cuts down a cedar tree. Or perhaps he takes a cypress or an oak tree. It might be a tree that grew in the forest. Or it might be a pine tree he planted. And the rain made it grow.
Isaiah,44,15,A man gets wood from trees to burn. He uses some of it to warm himself. He starts a fire and bakes bread. But he also uses some of it to make a god and worship it. He makes a statue of a god and bows down to it.
Isaiah,44,16,"He burns half of the wood in the fire. He prepares a meal over it. He cooks meat over it. He eats until he is full. He also warms himself. He says, “Good! I’m getting warm. The fire is nice and hot.”"
Isaiah,44,17,"From the rest of the wood he makes a statue. It becomes his god. He bows down and worships it. He prays to it. He says, “Save me! You are my god!”"
Isaiah,44,18,People like that don’t even know what they are doing. Their eyes are shut so that they can’t see the truth. Their minds are closed so that they can’t understand it.
Isaiah,44,19,"No one even stops to think about this. No one has any sense or understanding. If anyone did, they would say, “I used half of the wood for fuel. I even baked bread over the fire. I cooked meat. Then I ate it. Should I now make a statue of a god out of the wood that’s left over? Should I bow down to a block of wood? The Lord would hate that.”"
Isaiah,44,20,"That’s as foolish as eating ashes! The mind of someone like that has led him astray. He can’t save himself. He can’t bring himself to say, “This thing I’m holding in my right hand isn’t really a god at all.”"
Isaiah,44,21,"The Lord says, “Family of Jacob, remember these things. People of Israel, you are my servant. I have made you. You are my servant. Israel, I will not forget you."
Isaiah,44,22,I will sweep your sins away as if they were a cloud. I will blow them away as if they were the morning mist. Return to me. Then I will set you free.”
Isaiah,44,23,"Sing for joy, you heavens! The Lord does wonderful things. Shout out loud, you earth! Burst into song, you mountains! Sing, you forests and all your trees! The Lord sets the family of Jacob free. He shows his glory in Israel."
Isaiah,44,24,"The Lord says, “People of Israel, I set you free. I formed you when you were born as a nation. “I am the Lord . I am the Maker of everything. I alone stretch out the heavens. I spread out the earth by myself."
Isaiah,44,25,“Some prophets are not really prophets at all. I show that their signs are fake. I make those who practice evil magic look foolish. I destroy the learning of those who think they are wise. Their knowledge does not make any sense at all.
Isaiah,44,26,"I make the words of my servants the prophets come true. I carry out what my messengers say will happen. “I say about Jerusalem, ‘My people will live there again.’ I say about the towns of Judah, ‘They will be rebuilt.’ I say about their broken-down buildings, ‘I will make them like new again.’"
Isaiah,44,27,"I say to the deep waters, ‘Dry up. Let your streams become dry.’"
Isaiah,44,28,"I say about Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd. He will accomplish everything I want him to. He will say about Jerusalem, “Let it be rebuilt.” And he will say about the temple, “Let its foundations be laid.” ’"
Isaiah,45,1,"“Cyrus is my anointed king. I take hold of his right hand. I give him the power to bring nations under his control. I help him strip kings of their power to go to war against him. I break city gates open so he can go through them. I say to him,"
Isaiah,45,2,‘I will march out ahead of you. I will make the mountains level. I will break down bronze gates. I will cut through their heavy iron bars.
Isaiah,45,3,I will give you treasures that are hidden away. I will give you riches that are stored up in secret places. Then you will know that I am the Lord. I am the God of Israel. I am sending for you by name.
Isaiah,45,4,"Cyrus, I am sending for you by name. I am doing it for the good of the family of Jacob. They are my servant. I am doing it for Israel. They are my chosen people. You do not know anything about me. But I am giving you a title of honor."
Isaiah,45,5,I am the Lord . There is no other Lord. I am the one and only God. You do not know anything about me. But I will make you strong.
Isaiah,45,6,Then people will know there is no God but me. Everyone from where the sun rises in the east to where it sets in the west will know it. I am the Lord. There is no other Lord.
Isaiah,45,7,I cause light to shine. I also create darkness. I bring good times. I also create hard times. I do all these things. I am the Lord.
Isaiah,45,8,"“ ‘Rain down my godliness, you heavens above. Let the clouds shower it down. Let the earth open wide to receive it. Let freedom spring to life. Let godliness grow richly along with it. I have created all these things. I am the Lord .’ ”"
Isaiah,45,9,"How terrible it will be for anyone who argues with their Maker! They are like a broken piece of pottery lying on the ground. Does clay say to a potter, “What are you making?” Does a pot say, “The potter doesn’t have any skill”?"
Isaiah,45,10,"How terrible it will be for anyone who says to a father, “Why did you give me life?” How terrible for anyone who says to a mother, “Why have you brought me into the world?”"
Isaiah,45,11,"The Lord is the Holy One of Israel. He made them. He says to them, “Are you asking me about what will happen to my children? Are you telling me what I should do with what my hands have made?"
Isaiah,45,12,I made the earth. I created human beings to live there. My own hands spread out the heavens. I put all the stars in their places.
Isaiah,45,13,"I will stir up Cyrus and help him win his battles. I will make all his roads straight. He will rebuild Jerusalem. My people have been taken away from their country. But he will set them free. I will not pay him to do it. He will not receive a reward for it,” says the Lord who rules over all."
Isaiah,45,14,"The Lord says to the people of Jerusalem, “You will get everything Egypt produces. You will receive everything the people of Cush and the tall Sabeans get in trade. All of it will belong to you. And all these people will walk behind you as slaves. They will be put in chains and come over to you. They will bow down to you. They will admit, ‘God is with you. There is no other God.’ ”"
Isaiah,45,15,You are a God who has been hiding yourself. You are the God of Israel. You save us.
Isaiah,45,16,All those who make statues of gods will be put to shame. They will be dishonored. They will be led away in shame together.
Isaiah,45,17,But the Lord will save Israel. He will save them forever. They will never be put to shame or dishonored. That will be true for all time to come.
Isaiah,45,18,"The Lord created the heavens. He is God. He formed the earth and made it. He set it firmly in place. He didn’t create it to be empty. Instead, he formed it for people to live on. He says, “I am the Lord. There is no other Lord."
Isaiah,45,19,"I have not spoken in secret. I have not spoken from a dark place. I have not said to Jacob’s people, ‘It is useless to look for me.’ I am the Lord . I always speak the truth. I always say what is right."
Isaiah,45,20,"“Come together, you people of the nations who escaped from Babylon. Gather together and come into court. Only people who do not know anything would carry around gods that are made out of wood. They pray to false gods that can’t save them."
Isaiah,45,21,Tell me what will happen. State your case. Talk it over together. Who spoke long ago about what would happen? Who said it a long time ago? I did. I am the Lord. I am the one and only God. I always do what is right. I am the one who saves. There is no God but me.
Isaiah,45,22,"“All you who live anywhere on earth, turn to me and be saved. I am God. There is no other God."
Isaiah,45,23,"I have made a promise in my own name. I have spoken with complete honesty. I will not take back a single word. I said, ‘Everyone will kneel down to me. Everyone’s mouth will make promises in my name.’"
Isaiah,45,24,"They will say, ‘The Lord is the only one who can save us. Only he can make us strong.’ ” All those who have been angry with the Lord will come to him. And they will be put to shame."
Isaiah,45,25,But the Lord will save all the people of Israel. And so they will boast about the Lord.
Isaiah,46,1,The gods named Bel and Nebo are brought down in shame. The statues of them are being carried away on the backs of animals. They used to be carried around by the people who worshiped them. But now they’ve become a heavy load for tired animals.
Isaiah,46,2,The gods named Bel and Nebo are brought down in shame together. They aren’t able to save their own statues. They themselves are carried off as prisoners.
Isaiah,46,3,"The Lord says, “Family of Jacob, listen to me. Pay attention, you people of Israel who are left alive. I have taken good care of you since your life began. I have carried you since you were born as a nation."
Isaiah,46,4,"I will continue to carry you even when you are old. I will take good care of you even when your hair is gray. I have made you, and I will carry you. I will take care of you, and I will save you. I am the Lord."
Isaiah,46,5,“Who will you compare me with? Who is equal to me? What am I like? Who can you compare me with?
Isaiah,46,6,Some people pour out gold from their bags. They weigh out silver on the scales. They hire someone who works with gold to make it into a god. They bow down to it and worship it.
Isaiah,46,7,"They lift it up on their shoulders and carry it. They set it up in its place, and there it stands. It can’t move from that spot. Someone might cry out to it. But it does not answer. It can’t save them from their troubles."
Isaiah,46,8,"So remember this, you who refuse to obey me. Keep it in your minds and hearts."
Isaiah,46,9,“Remember what happened in the past. Think about what took place long ago. I am God. There is no other God. I am God. There is no one like me.
Isaiah,46,10,"Before something even happens, I announce how it will end. In fact, from times long ago I announced what was still to come. I say, ‘My plan will succeed. I will do anything I want to do.’"
Isaiah,46,11,"I will send for a man from the east to carry out my plan. From a land far away, he will come like a bird that kills its food. I will bring about what I have said. I will do what I have planned."
Isaiah,46,12,"Listen to me, you stubborn people. Pay attention, you who now refuse to do what I have said is right."
Isaiah,46,13,The time is almost here for me to make everything right. It is not far away. The time for me to save you will not be put off. I will save the city of Zion. I will bring honor to Israel.
Isaiah,47,1,"“City of Babylon, go down and sit in the dust. Leave your throne and sit on the ground. Queen city of the Babylonians, your life will not be comfortable and easy anymore."
Isaiah,47,2,Get millstones and grind some flour like a female slave. Take off your veil. Lift up your skirts. Make your legs bare. Wade through the streams.
Isaiah,47,3,Everyone will see your naked body. Everyone will see your shame. I will pay you back for what you did. I will not spare any of your people.”
Isaiah,47,4,The one who sets us free is the Holy One of Israel. His name is the Lord Who Rules Over All.
Isaiah,47,5,"The Lord says, “Queen city of the Babylonians, go into a dark prison. Sit there quietly. You will not be called the queen of kingdoms anymore."
Isaiah,47,6,I was angry with my people. I treated them as if they did not belong to me. I handed them over to you. And you did not show them any pity. You even placed heavy loads on their old people.
Isaiah,47,7,"You said, ‘I am queen forever!’ But you did not think about what you were doing. You did not consider how things might turn out."
Isaiah,47,8,"“So listen, you who love pleasure. You think you are safe and secure. You say to yourself, ‘I am like a god. No one is greater than I am. I’ll never be a widow. And my children will never be taken away from me.’"
Isaiah,47,9,But both of these things will happen to you in a moment. They will take place on a single day. You will lose your children. And you will become a widow. That is what will happen to you. All your evil magic and powerful spells will not save you.
Isaiah,47,10,"You have felt secure in your evil ways. You have said, ‘No one sees what I’m doing.’ Your wisdom and knowledge lead you astray. You say to yourself, ‘I am like a god. No one is greater than I am.’"
Isaiah,47,11,So horrible trouble will come on you. You will not know how to use your evil magic to make it go away. Great trouble will fall on you. No amount of money can keep it away. Something terrible will happen to you all at once. You will not see it coming ahead of time.
Isaiah,47,12,“So keep on casting your magic spells. Keep on practicing your evil magic. You have been doing those things ever since you were a child. Perhaps they will help you. Maybe they will scare your enemies away.
Isaiah,47,13,All the advice you have received has only worn you out! Let those who study the heavens come forward. They claim to know what is going to happen by watching the stars every month. So let them save you from the trouble that is coming on you.
Isaiah,47,14,They are just like straw. Fire will burn them up. They can’t even save themselves from the powerful flames. These are not like coals that can warm anyone. This is not like a fire to sit by.
Isaiah,47,15,They can’t do you any good. You have done business with them ever since you were a child. You have always asked them for advice. All of them are bewildered and continue in their own ways. None of them can save you.”
Isaiah,48,1,"People of Jacob, listen to me. You are called by the name of Israel. You come from the family line of Judah. You make promises in the name of the Lord. You pray to Israel’s God. But you aren’t honest. You don’t mean what you say."
Isaiah,48,2,"You call yourselves citizens of the holy city of Jerusalem. You say you depend on Israel’s God. His name is the Lord Who Rules Over All. He says,"
Isaiah,48,3,“Long ago I told you ahead of time what would happen. I announced it and made it known. Then all of a sudden I acted. And those things took place.
Isaiah,48,4,I knew how stubborn you were. Your neck muscles were as unbending as iron. Your forehead was as hard as bronze.
Isaiah,48,5,"So I told you those things long ago. Before they happened I announced them to you. I did it so you would not be able to say, ‘My statues of gods did them. My wooden and metal gods made them happen.’"
Isaiah,48,6,You have heard me tell you these things. Think about all of them. Won’t you admit they have taken place? “From now on I will tell you about new things that will happen. I have not made them known to you before.
Isaiah,48,7,"These things are taking place right now. They did not happen long ago. You have not heard of them before today. So you can’t say, ‘Oh, yes. I already knew about them.’"
Isaiah,48,8,"You have not heard or understood what I said. Your ears have been plugged up for a long time. I knew very well that you would turn against me. From the day you were born, you have refused to obey me."
Isaiah,48,9,For the honor of my own name I wait to show my anger. I hold it back from you so people will continue to praise me. I do not want to destroy you completely.
Isaiah,48,10,I have tested you in the furnace of suffering. I have tried to make you pure. But I did not use as much heat as it takes to make silver pure.
Isaiah,48,11,I tried to purify you for my own honor. I did it for the honor of my name. How can I let myself be dishonored? I will not give up my glory to any other god.
Isaiah,48,12,"“Family of Jacob, listen to me. People of Israel, pay attention. I have chosen you. I am the first and the last. I am the Lord."
Isaiah,48,13,"With my own hand I laid the foundations of the earth. With my right hand I spread out the heavens. When I send for them, they come and stand ready to obey me."
Isaiah,48,14,"“People of Israel, come together and listen to me. What other god has said ahead of time that certain things would happen? I have chosen Cyrus. He will carry out my plans against Babylon. He will use his power against the Babylonians."
Isaiah,48,15,I myself have spoken. I have chosen him to carry out my purpose. I will bring him to Babylon. He will succeed in what I tell him to do.
Isaiah,48,16,"“Come close and listen to me. “From the first time I said Cyrus was coming, I did not do it in secret. When he comes, I will be there.” The Lord and King has filled me with his Spirit. People of Israel, he has sent me to you."
Isaiah,48,17,"The Lord is the Holy One of Israel. He sets his people free. He says to them, “I am the Lord your God. I teach you what is best for you. I direct you in the way you should go."
Isaiah,48,18,"I wish you would pay attention to my commands. If you did, peace would flow over you like a river. Godliness would sweep over you like the waves of the ocean."
Isaiah,48,19,Your family would be like the sand. Your children after you would be as many as the grains of sand by the sea. It would be impossible to count them. I would always accept the members of your family line. They would never disappear or be destroyed.”
Isaiah,48,20,"People of Israel, leave Babylon! Hurry up and get away from the Babylonians! Here is what I want you to announce. Make it known with shouts of joy. Send the news out from one end of the earth to the other. Say, “The Lord has set free his servant Jacob.”"
Isaiah,48,21,"They didn’t get thirsty when he led them through the deserts. He made water flow out of the rock for them. He broke the rock open, and water came out of it."
Isaiah,48,22,"“There is no peace for those who are evil,” says the Lord."
Isaiah,49,1,"People who live on the islands, listen to me. Pay attention, you nations far away. Before I was born the Lord chose me to serve him. Before I was born the Lord spoke my name."
Isaiah,49,2,He made my words like a sharp sword. He hid me in the palm of his hand. He made me into a sharpened arrow. He took good care of me and kept me safe.

Isaiah,51,13,How can you forget me? I made you. I stretch out the heavens. I lay the foundations of the earth. Why are you terrified every day? Is it because those who are angry with you are crushing you? Is it because they are trying to destroy you? Their anger can’t harm you anymore.

Isaiah,52,5,"“Now look at what has happened to them,” announces the Lord. “Once again my people have been taken away. And no one paid anything for them. Those who rule over them brag about it,” announces the Lord. “All day long without stopping, people speak evil things against my name."
Isaiah,52,6,So the day will come when my people will really know the meaning of my name. They will know what kind of God I am. They will know that I told them ahead of time they would return to their land. They will know that it was I.”
Isaiah,52,7,"What a beautiful sight it is to see messengers coming with good news! How beautiful to see them coming down from the mountains with a message about peace! How wonderful it is when they bring the good news that we are saved! How wonderful when they say to Zion, “Your God rules!”"

Isaiah,52,15,But many nations will be surprised when they see what he has done. Kings will be so amazed that they will not be able to say anything. They will understand things they were never told. They will know the meaning of things they never heard.”
Isaiah,53,1,Who has believed what we’ve been saying? Who has seen the Lord ’s saving power?
Isaiah,53,2,His servant grew up like a tender young plant. He grew like a root coming up out of dry ground. He didn’t have any beauty or majesty that made us notice him. There wasn’t anything special about the way he looked that drew us to him.
Isaiah,53,3,People looked down on him. They didn’t accept him. He knew all about pain and suffering. He was like someone people turn their faces away from. We looked down on him. We didn’t have any respect for him.
Isaiah,53,4,He suffered the things we should have suffered. He took on himself the pain that should have been ours. But we thought God was punishing him. We thought God was wounding him and making him suffer.
Isaiah,53,5,But the servant was pierced because we had sinned. He was crushed because we had done what was evil. He was punished to make us whole again. His wounds have healed us.

Isaiah,53,8,He was arrested and sentenced to death. Then he was taken away. He was cut off from this life. He was punished for the sins of my people. Who among those who were living at that time tried to stop what was happening?
Isaiah,53,9,He was given a grave with those who were evil. But his body was buried in the tomb of a rich man. He was killed even though he hadn’t harmed anyone. And he had never lied to anyone.
Isaiah,53,10,"The Lord says, “It was my plan to crush him and cause him to suffer. I made his life an offering to pay for sin. But he will see all his children after him. In fact, he will continue to live. My plan will be brought about through him."
Isaiah,53,11,"After he has suffered, he will see the light of life. And he will be satisfied. My godly servant will make many people godly because of what he will accomplish. He will be punished for their sins."
Isaiah,53,12,So I will give him a place of honor among those who are great. He will be rewarded just like others who win the battle. That’s because he was willing to give his life as a sacrifice. He was counted among those who had committed crimes. He took the sins of many people on himself. And he gave his life for those who had done what is wrong.”
Isaiah,54,1,"“Jerusalem, sing! You are now like a woman who never had a child. Burst into song! Shout for joy! You who have never had labor pains, you are now all alone. But you will have more children than a woman who still has a husband,” says the Lord."

Isaiah,57,5,You burn with sinful desire among the oak trees. You worship your gods under every green tree. You sacrifice your children in the valleys. You also do it under the cliffs.
Isaiah,57,6,You have chosen some of the smooth stones in the valleys to be your gods. You have joined yourselves to them. You have even poured out drink offerings to them. You have given grain offerings to them. So why should I take pity on you?
Isaiah,57,7,You have made your bed on a very high hill. You went up there to offer your sacrifices.
Isaiah,57,8,You have set up statues to remind you of your gods. You have put them behind your doors and doorposts. You deserted me. You invited other lovers into your bed. You climbed into it and welcomed them. You made a deal with them. And you looked with desire at their naked bodies.

Isaiah,58,3,"‘We have gone without food,’ they say. ‘Why haven’t you noticed it? We have made ourselves suffer. Why haven’t you paid any attention to us?’ “On the day when you fast, you do as you please. You take advantage of all your workers."
Isaiah,58,4,"When you fast, it ends in arguing and fighting. You hit one another with your fists. That is an evil thing to do. The way you are now fasting keeps your prayers from being heard in heaven."
Isaiah,58,5,Do you think that is the way I want you to fast? Is it only a time for people to make themselves suffer? Is it only for people to bow their heads like tall grass bent by the wind? Is it only for people to lie down in ashes and clothes of mourning? Is that what you call a fast? Do you think I can accept that?
Isaiah,58,6,“Here is the way I want you to fast. “Set free those who are held by chains without any reason. Untie the ropes that hold people as slaves. Set free those who are crushed. Break every evil chain.
Isaiah,58,7,Share your food with hungry people. Provide homeless people with a place to stay. Give naked people clothes to wear. Provide for the needs of your own family.
Isaiah,58,8,Then the light of my blessing will shine on you like the rising sun. I will heal you quickly. I will march out ahead of you. And my glory will follow behind you and guard you. That’s because I always do what is right.
Isaiah,58,9,"You will call out to me for help. And I will answer you. You will cry out. And I will say, ‘Here I am.’ “Get rid of the chains you use to hold others down. Stop pointing your finger at others as if they had done something wrong. Stop saying harmful things about them."
Isaiah,58,10,Work hard to feed hungry people. Satisfy the needs of those who are crushed. Then my blessing will light up your darkness. And the night of your suffering will become as bright as the noonday sun.
Isaiah,58,11,I will always guide you. I will satisfy your needs in a land baked by the sun. I will make you stronger. You will be like a garden that has plenty of water. You will be like a spring whose water never runs dry.
Isaiah,58,12,Your people will rebuild the cities that were destroyed long ago. And you will build again on the old foundations. You will be called One Who Repairs Broken Walls. You will be called One Who Makes City Streets Like New Again.
Isaiah,58,13,“Do not work on the Sabbath day. Do not do just anything you want to on my holy day. Make the Sabbath a day you can enjoy. Honor the Lord ’s holy day. Do not work on it. Do not do just anything you want to. Do not talk about things that are worthless.
Isaiah,58,14,Then you will find your joy in me. I will give you control over the most important places in the land. And you will enjoy all the good things in the land I gave your father Jacob.” The Lord has spoken.
Isaiah,59,1,"People of Israel, the Lord ’s arm is not too weak to save you. His ears aren’t too deaf to hear your cry for help."
Isaiah,59,2,But your sins have separated you from your God. They have caused him to turn his face away from you. So he won’t listen to you.
Isaiah,59,3,Your hands and fingers are stained with blood. You are guilty of committing murder. Your mouth has told lies. Your tongue says evil things.
Isaiah,59,4,People aren’t fair when they present cases in court. They aren’t honest when they state their case. They depend on weak arguments. They tell lies. They plan to make trouble. Then they carry it out.
Isaiah,59,5,"The plans they make are like the eggs of poisonous snakes. Anyone who eats those eggs will die. When one of them is broken, a snake comes out."
Isaiah,59,6,Those people weave their evil plans together like a spider’s web. But the webs they make can’t be used as clothes. They can’t cover themselves with what they make. Their acts are evil. They do things to harm others.
Isaiah,59,7,They are always in a hurry to sin. They run quickly to murder those who aren’t guilty. They love to think up evil plans. They leave a trail of harmful actions.
Isaiah,59,8,They don’t know how to live at peace with others. What they do isn’t fair. They lead twisted lives. No one who lives like that will enjoy peace and rest.
Isaiah,59,9,"We aren’t being treated fairly. We haven’t been set free yet. The God who always does what is right hasn’t come to help us. We look for light, but we see nothing but darkness. We look for brightness, but we walk in deep shadows."
Isaiah,59,10,"Like blind people we feel our way along the wall. We are like those who can’t see. At noon we trip and fall as if the sun had already set. Compared to those who are healthy, we are like dead people."
Isaiah,59,11,All of us growl like hungry bears. We sound like doves as we mourn. We want the Lord to do what is fair and save us. But he doesn’t do it. We long for him to set us free. But the time for that seems far away.
Isaiah,59,12,That’s because we’ve done so many things he considers wrong. Our sins prove that we are guilty. The wrong things we’ve done are always troubling us. We admit that we have sinned.
Isaiah,59,13,We’ve refused to obey the Lord. We’ve made evil plans against him. We’ve turned our backs on our God. We’ve stirred up conflict and refused to follow him. We’ve told lies that came from our own minds.
Isaiah,59,14,So people stop others from doing what is fair. They keep them from doing what is right. No one tells the truth in court anymore. No one is honest there.
Isaiah,59,15,"In fact, truth can’t be found anywhere. Those who refuse to do evil are attacked. The Lord sees that people aren’t treating others fairly. That makes him unhappy."
Isaiah,59,16,He sees that there is no one who helps his people. He is shocked that no one stands up for them. So he will use his own powerful arm to save them. He has the strength to do it because he is holy.
Isaiah,59,17,He will put the armor of holiness on his chest. He’ll put the helmet of salvation on his head. He’ll pay people back for the wrong things they do. He’ll wrap himself in anger as if it were a coat.
Isaiah,59,18,He will pay his enemies back for what they have done. He’ll pour his anger out on them. He’ll punish those who attack him. He’ll give the people in the islands what they have coming to them.

Isaiah,60,9,People from the islands are coming to me. The ships of Tarshish are out in front. They are bringing your children back from far away. Your children are bringing their silver and gold with them. They are coming to honor me. I am the Lord your God. I am the Holy One of Israel. I have honored you.
Isaiah,60,10,"“People from other lands will rebuild your walls. Their kings will serve you. When I was angry with you, I struck you. But now I will show you my tender love."

Isaiah,60,16,You will get everything you need from kings and nations. You will be like children who are nursing at their mother’s breasts. Then you will know that I am the one who saves you. I am the Lord . I set you free. I am the Mighty One of Jacob.
Isaiah,60,17,Instead of bronze I will bring you gold. In place of iron I will give you silver. Instead of wood I will bring you bronze. In place of stones I will give you iron. I will make peace govern you. I will make godliness rule over you.
Isaiah,60,18,People will no longer harm one another in your land. They will not wipe out or destroy anything inside your borders. You will call your walls Salvation. And you will name your gates Praise.
Isaiah,60,19,You will not need the light of the sun by day anymore. The bright light of the moon will no longer have to shine on you. I will be your light forever. My glory will shine on you. I am the Lord your God.
Isaiah,60,20,Your sun will never set again. Your moon will never lose its light. I will be your light forever. Your days of sorrow will come to an end.
Isaiah,60,21,Then all your people will do what is right. The land will belong to them forever. They will be like a young tree I have planted. My hands have created them. They will show how glorious I am.

Isaiah,61,3,He wants me to help those in Zion who are filled with sorrow. I will put beautiful crowns on their heads in place of ashes. I will anoint them with olive oil to give them joy instead of sorrow. I will give them a spirit of praise in place of a spirit of sadness. They will be like oak trees that are strong and straight. The Lord himself will plant them in the land. That will show how glorious he is.

Isaiah,61,9,Their children after them will be famous among the nations. Their families will be praised by people everywhere. All those who see them will agree that I have blessed them.”
Isaiah,61,10,"The people of Jerusalem will say, “We take great delight in the Lord. We are joyful because we belong to our God. He has dressed us with salvation as if it were our clothes.

Isaiah,63,1,"Who is this man coming from the city of Bozrah in Edom? His clothes are stained bright red. Who is he? He is dressed up in all his glory. He is marching toward us with great strength. The Lord answers, “It is I. I have won the battle. I am mighty. I have saved my people.”"
Isaiah,63,2,Why are your clothes red? They look as if you have been stomping on grapes in a winepress.
Isaiah,63,3,"The Lord answers, “I have been stomping on the nations as if they were grapes. No one was there to help me. I walked all over the nations because I was angry. That is why I stomped on them. Their blood splashed all over my clothes. So my clothes were stained bright red."

Isaiah,63,10,But they refused to obey him. They made his Holy Spirit sad. So he turned against them and became their enemy. He himself fought against them.
Isaiah,63,11,"Then his people remembered what he did long ago. They recalled the days of Moses and his people. They asked, “Where is the God who brought Israel through the Red Sea? Moses led them as the shepherd of his flock. Where is the God who put his Holy Spirit among them?"
Isaiah,63,12,He used his glorious and powerful arm to help Moses. He parted the waters of the sea in front of them. That mighty act made him famous forever.
Isaiah,63,13,"He led them through that deep sea. Like a horse in open country, they didn’t trip and fall."
Isaiah,63,14,They were like cattle that are taken down to the plains. They were given rest by the Spirit of the Lord .” That’s how he guided his people. So he made a glorious name for himself.
Isaiah,63,15," Lord , look down from heaven. Look down from your holy and glorious throne. Where is your great love for us? Where is your power? Why don’t you show us your tender love and concern?"
Isaiah,63,16,"You are our Father. Abraham might not accept us as his children. Jacob might not recognize us as his family. But you are our Father, Lord. Your name is One Who Always Sets Us Free."
Isaiah,63,17," Lord , why do you let us wander away from you? Why do you let us become so stubborn that we don’t respect you? Come back and help us. We are the tribes that belong to you."
Isaiah,63,18,For a little while your holy people possessed the land. But now our enemies have torn your temple down.
Isaiah,63,19,We are like people you never ruled over. We are like those who don’t belong to you.
Isaiah,64,1,I wish you would open up your heavens and come down to us! I wish the mountains would tremble when you show your power!
Isaiah,64,2,Be like a fire that causes twigs to burn. It also makes water boil. So come down and make yourself known to your enemies. Cause the nations to shake with fear when they see your power!
Isaiah,64,3,"Long ago you did some wonderful things we didn’t expect. You came down, and the mountains trembled when you showed your power."
Isaiah,64,4,No one’s ears have ever heard of a God like you. No one’s eyes have ever seen a God who is greater than you. No God but you acts for the good of those who trust in him.
Isaiah,64,5,"You come to help those who enjoy doing what is right. You help those who thank you for teaching them how to live. But when we continued to disobey you, you became angry with us. So how can we be saved?"
Isaiah,64,6,All of us have become like someone who is “unclean.” All the good things we do are like dirty rags to you. All of us are like leaves that have dried up. Our sins sweep us away like the wind.
Isaiah,64,7,No one prays to you. No one asks you for help. You have turned your face away from us. You have let us feel the effects of our sins.
Isaiah,64,8," Lord , you are our Father. We are the clay. You are the potter. Your hands made all of us."

Isaiah,64,12," Lord , won’t you help us even after everything that’s happened? Will you keep silent and punish us more than we can stand?"
Isaiah,65,1,"The Lord says, “I made myself known to those who were not asking for me. I was found by those who were not trying to find me. I spoke to a nation that did not pray to me. ‘Here I am,’ I said. ‘Here I am.’"
Isaiah,65,2,All day long I have held out my hands to welcome a stubborn nation. They lead sinful lives. They go where their evil thoughts take them.
Isaiah,65,3,They are always making me very angry. They do it right in front of me. They offer sacrifices in the gardens of other gods. They burn incense on altars that are made out of bricks.
Isaiah,65,4,They sit among the graves. They spend their nights talking to the spirits of the dead. They eat the meat of pigs. Their cooking pots hold soup that has ‘unclean’ meat in it.
Isaiah,65,5,"They say, ‘Keep away! Don’t come near us! We are too sacred for you!’ Those people are like smoke in my nose. They are like a fire that keeps burning all day."

Isaiah,65,7,I will punish them for their sins. I will also punish them for the sins of their people before them.” This is what the Lord says. “They burned sacrifices on the mountains. They disobeyed me by worshiping other gods on the hills. So I will make sure they are fully punished for all the sins they have committed.”
Isaiah,65,8,"The Lord says, “Sometimes juice is still left in grapes that have been crushed. So people say, ‘Don’t destroy them.’ They are still of some benefit.” That is what I will do for the good of those who serve me. I will not destroy all my people."

Isaiah,65,11,“But some of you have deserted me. You no longer worship on my holy mountain of Zion. You spread a table for the god called Good Fortune. You offer bowls of mixed wine to the god named Fate.
Isaiah,65,12,"So I will make it your fate to be killed by swords. All of you will die in the battle. That’s because I called out to you, but you did not answer me. I spoke to you, but you did not listen. You did what is evil in my sight. You chose to do what does not please me.”"
Isaiah,65,13,"So the Lord and King says, “Those who serve me will have food to eat. But you will be hungry. My servants will have plenty to drink. But you will be thirsty. Those who serve me will be full of joy. But you will be put to shame."

Isaiah,65,17,“I will create new heavens and a new earth. The things that have happened before will not be remembered. They will not even enter your minds.

Isaiah,65,19,And I will be full of joy because of Jerusalem. I will take delight in my people. Weeping and crying will not be heard there anymore.
Isaiah,65,20,“Babies in Jerusalem will no longer live only a few days. Old people will not fail to live for a very long time. Those who live to the age of 100 will be thought of as mere children when they die. Those who die before they are 100 will be considered as having been under God’s curse.
Isaiah,65,21,My people will build houses and live in them. They will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
Isaiah,65,22,They will no longer build houses only to have others live in them. They will no longer plant crops only to have others eat them. My people will live to be as old as trees. My chosen ones will enjoy for a long time the things they have worked for.

Isaiah,66,3,"But others are not like that. They sacrifice bulls to me, but at the same time they kill people. They offer lambs to me, but they also sacrifice dogs to other gods. They bring grain offerings to me, but they also offer pig’s blood to other gods. They burn incense to me, but they also worship statues of gods. They have chosen to go their own way. They take delight in things I hate."
Isaiah,66,4,"So I have also made a choice. I will make them suffer greatly. I will bring on them what they are afraid of. When I called out to them, no one answered me. When I spoke to them, no one listened. They did what is evil in my sight. They chose to do what displeases me.”"
Isaiah,66,5,"Listen to the word of the Lord. Listen, you who tremble with fear when he speaks. He says, “Some of your own people hate you. They turn their backs on you because you are faithful to me. They make fun of you and say, ‘Let the Lord show his glory by saving you. Then we can see how happy you are.’ But they will be put to shame."
Isaiah,66,6,Hear the loud sounds coming from the city! Listen to the noise coming from the temple! I am the one causing it. I am paying back my enemies for everything they have done.
Isaiah,66,7,“Zion is like a woman who has a baby before she goes into labor. She has a son even before her labor pains begin.

Isaiah,66,19,"“I will give them a sign. I will send to the nations some of those who are left alive. I will send some of them to the people of Tarshish, Libya and Lydia, who are famous for using bows. I will send others to Tubal and Greece. And I will send still others to islands far away. The people who live there have not heard about my fame. They have not seen my glory. But when I act, those I send will tell the nations about my glory."
Isaiah,66,20,"And they will bring back all the people of Israel from all those nations. They will bring them to my holy mountain in Jerusalem. My people will ride on horses, mules and camels.
