Ezra,1,1,"It was the first year of the rule of Cyrus. He was king of Persia. The Lord inspired him to send a message all through his kingdom. It happened so that what the Lord had spoken through Jeremiah would come true. The message was written down. It said,"
Ezra,1,2,"“Cyrus, the king of Persia, says, “ ‘The Lord is the God of heaven. He has given me all the kingdoms on earth. He has appointed me to build a temple for him at Jerusalem in Judah."
Ezra,1,3,Any of his people among you may go up to Jerusalem and build the Lord ’s temple. He is the God of Israel. He is the God who is in Jerusalem. And may their God be with them.
Ezra,1,4,The people still left alive in every place must bring gifts to the people going. They must provide silver and gold to the people going up to Jerusalem. The people must bring goods and livestock. They should also bring any offerings they choose to. All those gifts will be for God’s temple in Jerusalem.’ ”
Ezra,1,5,Then everyone God had inspired prepared to go. They wanted to go up to Jerusalem and build the Lord ’s temple there. They included the family leaders of Judah and Benjamin. They also included the priests and Levites.
Ezra,1,6,All their neighbors helped them. They gave them silver and gold objects. They gave them goods and livestock. And they gave them gifts of great value. All those things were added to the other offerings the people chose to give.
Ezra,1,7,King Cyrus also brought out the objects that belonged to the Lord ’s temple. Nebuchadnezzar had carried them off from Jerusalem. He had put them in the temple of his own god.
Ezra,1,8,"Cyrus, the king of Persia, told Mithredath to bring them out. Mithredath was in charge of the temple treasures. He counted those objects. Then he gave them to Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah."
Ezra,1,9,"Here is a list of the objects. There were 30 gold dishes. There were 1,000 silver dishes. There were 29 silver pans."
Ezra,1,10,"There were 30 gold bowls. There were 410 matching silver bowls. There were 1,000 other objects."
Ezra,1,11,"The total number of gold and silver objects was 5,400. Sheshbazzar brought all of these back with him to Jerusalem. So Sheshbazzar and the Jews who had been forced to leave Judah came up from Babylon to Jerusalem."
Ezra,2,1,Nebuchadnezzar had taken many Jews away from the land of Judah. He had forced them to go to Babylon as prisoners. Now they returned to Jerusalem and Judah. All of them went back to their own towns. Nebuchadnezzar was king of Babylon.
Ezra,2,2,"The leaders of the Jews included Zerubbabel, Joshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah and Reelaiah. They also included Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum and Baanah. Here is a list of the men of Israel who returned home."

Ezra,2,58,The total number of the members of the family lines of the temple servants and the servants of Solomon was 392.
Ezra,2,59,"Many people came up to Judah from the towns of Tel Melah, Tel Harsha, Kerub, Addon and Immer. But they weren’t able to prove that their families belonged to the people of Israel."
Ezra,2,60,"There were 652 of them from the family lines of Delaiah, Tobiah and Nekoda."
Ezra,2,61,"Here is a list of the members of the family lines of the priests. They were Hobaiah, Hakkoz and Barzillai. Barzillai had married a daughter of Barzillai from Gilead. So he was also called Barzillai."
Ezra,2,62,The priests looked for their family records. But they couldn’t find them. So they weren’t able to serve as priests. They were “unclean.”
Ezra,2,63,The governor gave them an order. He told them not to eat any of the most sacred food. They had to wait until there was a priest who could use the Urim and Thummim. The priest would use them to find out what the Lord wanted the people to do.
Ezra,2,64,"The total number of the entire group that returned was 42,360."
Ezra,2,65,"That didn’t include their 7,337 male and female slaves. There were also 200 male and female singers."
Ezra,2,66,"And there were 736 horses, 245 mules,"
Ezra,2,67,"435 camels and 6,720 donkeys."
Ezra,2,68,All the people arrived at the place in Jerusalem where the Lord ’s temple would be rebuilt. Then some of the leaders of the families brought offerings they chose to give. They would be used for rebuilding the house of God. It would stand in the same place it had been before.
Ezra,2,69,"The people gave money for the work. It was based on how much they had. They gave 1,100 pounds of gold. They also gave three tons of silver. And they gave 100 sets of clothes for the priests. All of that was added to the temple treasure."
Ezra,2,70,"The priests and Levites made their homes in their own towns. So did the musicians, the men who guarded the gates, and the temple servants. The rest of the Israelites also made their homes in their own towns."
Ezra,3,1,The Israelites had made their homes in their towns. In the seventh month all of them gathered together in Jerusalem.
Ezra,3,2,Then Joshua began to build the altar for burnt offerings to honor the God of Israel. Joshua was the son of Jozadak. The other priests helped Joshua. So did Zerubbabel and his men. They built the altar according to what is written in the Law of Moses. Moses was a man of God. Zerubbabel was the son of Shealtiel.
Ezra,3,3,The people who built the altar were afraid of the nations around them. But they built it anyway. They set it up where it had stood before. They sacrificed burnt offerings on it to the Lord . They offered the morning and evening sacrifices on it.
Ezra,3,4,Then they celebrated the Feast of Booths. They did it according to what is written in the Law. They sacrificed the number of burnt offerings required for each day.
Ezra,3,5,"After they celebrated the Feast of Booths, they sacrificed the regular burnt offerings. They offered the New Moon sacrifices. They also offered the sacrifices for all the appointed sacred feasts of the Lord . And they sacrificed the offerings the people chose to give him."
Ezra,3,6,On the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the Lord . They did it even though the foundation of the Lord ’s temple hadn’t been laid yet.
Ezra,3,7,"The people gave money to those who worked with stone and those who worked with wood. They gave food and drink and olive oil to the people of Sidon and Tyre. Then those people brought cedar logs down from Lebanon to the Mediterranean Sea. They floated them down to Joppa. Cyrus, the king of Persia, authorized them to do it."
Ezra,3,8,"It was the second month of the second year after they had arrived at the house of God in Jerusalem. Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, began the work. Joshua, the son of Jozadak, helped him. So did everyone else. That included the priests and Levites. It also included the rest of those who had returned to Jerusalem. They had been prisoners in the land of Babylon. Levites who were 20 years old or more were appointed to be in charge of building the Lord ’s house."
Ezra,3,9,Those who joined together to direct the work included Joshua and his sons and brothers. They also included Kadmiel and his sons. And they included the sons of Henadad and their sons and brothers. All those men were Levites. Kadmiel and his sons were members of the family line of Hodaviah.
Ezra,3,10,The builders laid the foundation of the Lord ’s temple. Then the priests came. They were wearing their special clothes. They brought their trumpets with them. The Levites who belonged to the family line of Asaph also came. They brought their cymbals with them. The priests and Levites took their places to praise the Lord . They did everything just as King David had required them to.
Ezra,3,11,"They sang to the Lord . They praised him. They gave thanks to him. They said, “The Lord is good. His faithful love to Israel continues forever.” All the people gave a loud shout. They praised the Lord . They were glad because the foundation of the Lord ’s temple had been laid."
Ezra,3,12,"But many of the older priests and Levites and family leaders wept out loud. They had seen the first temple. So when they saw the foundation of the second temple being laid, they wept. Others shouted with joy."
Ezra,3,13,No one could tell the difference between the shouts of joy and the sounds of weeping. That’s because the people made so much noise. The sound was heard far away.
Ezra,4,1,The people who had returned from Babylon were building a temple to honor the Lord . He is the God of Israel. The enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard about it.
Ezra,4,2,"Then those enemies came to Zerubbabel. The family leaders of Israel were with him. The enemies said, “We want to help you build. We’re just like you. We worship your God. We offer sacrifices to him. We’ve been doing that ever since the time of Esarhaddon. He was king of Assyria. He brought our people here.”"
Ezra,4,3,"Zerubbabel and Joshua answered them. So did the rest of the family leaders of Israel. They said, “You can’t help us build a temple to honor our God. You aren’t part of us. We’ll build it ourselves. We’ll do it to honor the Lord , the God of Israel. Cyrus, the king of Persia, commanded us to build it.”"
Ezra,4,4,Then the nations around Judah tried to make its people lose hope. They wanted to make them afraid to go on building.
Ezra,4,5,So those nations paid some of the Jewish officials to work against the people of Judah. They wanted their plans to fail. They did it during the whole time Cyrus was king of Persia. They kept doing it until Darius became king.
Ezra,4,6,The enemies of the Jews brought charges against the people of Judah and Jerusalem. It happened when Xerxes began to rule over Persia.
Ezra,4,7,"Then Artaxerxes became king of Persia. During his rule, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel and their friends wrote a letter to Artaxerxes. It was written in the Aramaic language. And it used the Aramaic alphabet."
Ezra,4,8,"Rehum and Shimshai also wrote a letter to King Artaxerxes. Rehum was the commanding officer. Shimshai was the secretary. Their letter was against the people of Jerusalem. It said,"
Ezra,4,9,"We, Rehum and Shimshai, are writing this letter. Rehum is the commanding officer. Shimshai is the secretary. Our friends join us in writing. They include the judges, officials and managers in charge of the people from Persia, Uruk and Babylon. They are also over the Elamites from Susa."
Ezra,4,10,"And they are over those who were forced to leave their countries. The great King Ashurbanipal, who is worthy of honor, forced them to leave. He moved them to the city of Samaria. He also moved them to other places west of the Euphrates River."
Ezra,4,11,"Here is a copy of the letter sent to Artaxerxes. We are sending this letter to you, King Artaxerxes. It is from your servants who live west of the Euphrates River."
Ezra,4,12,We want you to know about the people who left you and have come up to us. They have gone to Jerusalem and are rebuilding that evil city. It has caused trouble for a long time. Those people are making its walls like new again. They are repairing the foundations.
Ezra,4,13,"Here is something else we want you to know. Suppose this city is rebuilt. And suppose its walls are made like new again. Then no more taxes, gifts or fees will be collected. And sooner or later there will be less money for you."
Ezra,4,14,We owe a lot to you. We don’t want to see dishonor brought on you. So we’re sending this letter to tell you what is going on.
Ezra,4,15,"Then you can have a search made in the official records. Have someone check the records of the kings who ruled before you. If you do, you will find out that Jerusalem is an evil city. It causes trouble for kings and countries. For a long time the city has refused to let anyone rule over it. That’s why it was destroyed."
Ezra,4,16,"We want you to know that this city shouldn’t be rebuilt. Its walls shouldn’t be made like new again. If that happens, you won’t have anything left west of the Euphrates River."
Ezra,4,17,"The king replied, I am writing this letter to Rehum, the commanding officer. I am also writing it to Shimshai the secretary. And I am writing it to your friends living in Samaria and in other places west of the Euphrates River. I give you my greetings."
Ezra,4,18,The letter you sent us has been read to me. It has been explained to me in my language.
Ezra,4,19,I gave an order. I had a search made. Here is what we found out. Jerusalem has a long history of turning against the kings of the countries that have ruled over it. It has refused to remain under their control. It is always stirring up trouble.
Ezra,4,20,"Jerusalem has had powerful kings. Some of them ruled over everything west of the Euphrates. Taxes, gifts and fees were paid to them."
Ezra,4,21,So give an order to those men. Make them stop their work. Then the city won’t be rebuilt until I give the order.
Ezra,4,22,Pay careful attention to this matter. Why should we let this danger grow? That would not be in our best interests.
Ezra,4,23,The copy of the letter of King Artaxerxes was read to Rehum and Shimshai the secretary. It was also read to their friends. Right away they went to the Jews in Jerusalem. They forced them to stop their work.
Ezra,4,24,And so the work on the house of God in Jerusalem came to a stop. No more work was done on it until the second year that Darius was king of Persia.
Ezra,5,1,"Haggai and Zechariah, the prophets, prophesied to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem. They spoke to them in the name of the God of Israel. God had spoken to those prophets. Zechariah belonged to the family line of Iddo."
Ezra,5,2,"Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, began to work. So did Joshua, the son of Jozadak. They began to rebuild the house of God in Jerusalem. The prophets of God were right there with them. They were helping them."
Ezra,5,3,"At that time Tattenai was governor of the land west of the Euphrates River. He and Shethar-Bozenai and their friends went to the Jews. They asked them, “Who authorized you to rebuild this temple? Who told you that you could finish it?”"
Ezra,5,4,"They also asked, “What are the names of the people who are putting up this building?”"
Ezra,5,5,But the God of the Jews was watching over their elders. So they didn’t have to stop their work. First a report would have to be sent to Darius. Then they would have to receive his answer in writing.
Ezra,5,6,"Here is a copy of the letter sent to King Darius. It was from Tattenai, the governor of the land west of the Euphrates. Shethar-Bozenai joined him in writing it. So did their friends. They were officials of that land."
Ezra,5,7,"The report they sent to the king said, We are sending this letter to you, King Darius. We give you our most friendly greetings."
Ezra,5,8,We want you to know that we went to the land of Judah. We went to the temple of the great God. The people are building it with large stones. They are putting wooden beams in the walls. The people are working hard. The work is moving ahead very quickly under the direction of the people.
Ezra,5,9,"We asked the elders some questions. We said to them, “Who authorized you to rebuild this temple? Who told you that you could finish it?”"
Ezra,5,10,We also asked them what their names were. We wanted to write down the names of their leaders for your information.
Ezra,5,11,"Here is the answer they gave us. They said, “We serve the God of heaven and earth. We are rebuilding the temple that was built many years ago. The great King Solomon built it and finished it."
Ezra,5,12,But our people made the God of heaven angry. So he handed them over to Nebuchadnezzar from Chaldea. He was king of Babylon. He destroyed this temple. He forced the Jews to leave their own country. He took them away to Babylon.
Ezra,5,13,“But King Cyrus gave an order to rebuild this house of God. He gave it in the first year he was king of Babylon.
Ezra,5,14,He even removed some gold and silver objects from the temple of Babylon. Nebuchadnezzar had brought them there from the house of God in Jerusalem. He had taken them to the temple in Babylon. Then King Cyrus brought the objects out. He gave them to a man named Sheshbazzar. Cyrus had appointed him as governor.
Ezra,5,15,"Cyrus told him, ‘Take these objects with you. Go and put them in the temple in Jerusalem. Rebuild the house of God in the same place where it stood before.’"
Ezra,5,16,“So Sheshbazzar made the trip to Jerusalem. He laid the foundations of the house of God there. From that day until now the people have been working on it. But they haven’t finished it yet.”
Ezra,5,17,"If it pleases you, King Darius, let a search be made in the royal records. Search the official records of the kings of Babylon. Find out whether King Cyrus really did give an order to rebuild this house of God in Jerusalem. Then tell us what you decide to do."
Ezra,6,1,King Darius gave an order. He had a search made in the official records stored among the treasures at Babylon.
Ezra,6,2,A book was found in a safe storeroom at Ecbatana in the land of Media. Here is what was written on it. This is my official reply to your letter.
Ezra,6,3,"In the first year that Cyrus was king, he gave an order. It concerned God’s temple in Jerusalem. King Cyrus said, Rebuild the temple. Then the Jews can offer sacrifices there. Lay its foundations. The temple must be 90 feet high and 90 feet wide."
Ezra,6,4,Its walls must have three layers of large stones. They must also have a layer of beautiful wood. Use money from the royal treasures to pay for everything.
Ezra,6,5,The gold and silver objects from the house of God must be returned. Nebuchadnezzar had taken them from the first temple in Jerusalem. And he had brought them to Babylon. Now they must be returned to their places in the temple at Jerusalem. They must be put in the house of God there.
Ezra,6,6,"Tattenai, you are governor of the land west of the Euphrates River. I want you to stay away from the temple in Jerusalem. I also want you, Shethar-Bozenai, and you other officials of that area to stay away from it."
Ezra,6,7,Don’t try to stop the work on the temple of God. Let the governor of the Jews and their elders rebuild the house of their God. Let them build it in the same place where it stood before.
Ezra,6,8,Here is what I want you to do for the elders of the Jews. Here is how you must help them to build the house of their God. Pay all their expenses from the royal treasures. Use the money you collect from the people who live west of the Euphrates. Don’t let the work on the temple stop.
Ezra,6,9,"Don’t fail to give the priests in Jerusalem what they ask for each day. Give them what they need. Give them young bulls, rams and male lambs. The priests can use them to sacrifice burnt offerings to the God of heaven. Also give them wheat, salt, wine and olive oil."
Ezra,6,10,Give them those things so they can offer sacrifices that please the God of heaven. And I want them to pray that things will go well for me and my sons.
Ezra,6,11,"Don’t change this order. If anyone tries to change it, they must be put to death. A pole must be pulled from their house. The pole must be stuck through their body. Because that person tried to change my royal order, their house must be broken to pieces."
Ezra,6,12,God has chosen to put his Name in the temple at Jerusalem. May he wipe out any king or nation that lifts a hand to change this order. May he also wipe out anyone who tries to destroy the temple in Jerusalem. That’s what I have ordered. I am King Darius. Make sure you carry out my order.
Ezra,6,13,The governor Tattenai and Shethar-Bozenai carried out King Darius’s order. And so did their friends.
Ezra,6,14,"The elders of the Jews continued to build the temple. They enjoyed great success because of the preaching of Haggai and Zechariah, the prophets. Zechariah belonged to the family line of Iddo. The people finished building the temple. That’s what the God of Israel had commanded them to do. Cyrus and Darius had given orders allowing them to do it. Later, Artaxerxes supplied many things that were needed in the temple. Those three men were kings of Persia."
Ezra,6,15,So the temple was completed on the third day of the month of Adar. It was in the sixth year that Darius was king.
Ezra,6,16,"When the house of God was set apart, the people of Israel celebrated with joy. The priests and Levites joined them. So did the rest of those who had returned from the land of Babylon."
Ezra,6,17,"When the house of God was set apart to him, the people sacrificed 100 bulls. They also sacrificed 200 rams and 400 male lambs. As a sin offering for the whole nation of Israel, the people sacrificed 12 male goats. One goat was sacrificed for each tribe in Israel."
Ezra,6,18,The priests were appointed to their groups. And the Levites were appointed to their groups. All of them served God at Jerusalem. They served him in keeping with what is written in the Book of Moses.
Ezra,6,19,The people who had returned from the land of Babylon celebrated the Passover Feast. It was on the 14th day of the first month.
Ezra,6,20,"The priests and Levites had made themselves pure and “clean.” The Levites killed Passover lambs for the people who had returned from Babylon. They also did it for themselves and their relatives, the priests."
Ezra,6,21,So the Israelites who had returned ate the Passover lamb. They ate it together with all those who had separated themselves from the practices of their Gentile neighbors. Those practices were “unclean.” The people worshiped the Lord . He is the God of Israel.
Ezra,6,22,For seven days they celebrated the Feast of Unleavened Bread with joy. That’s because the Lord had filled them with joy. They were glad because he had changed the mind of the king of Persia. So the king had helped them with the work on the house of the God of Israel.
Ezra,7,1,"After all these things had happened, Ezra came up to Jerusalem from Babylon. It was during the rule of Artaxerxes. He was king of Persia. Ezra was the son of Seraiah. Seraiah was the son of Azariah. Azariah was the son of Hilkiah."
Ezra,7,2,Hilkiah was the son of Shallum. Shallum was the son of Zadok. Zadok was the son of Ahitub.
Ezra,7,3,Ahitub was the son of Amariah. Amariah was the son of Azariah. Azariah was the son of Meraioth.
Ezra,7,4,Meraioth was the son of Zerahiah. Zerahiah was the son of Uzzi. Uzzi was the son of Bukki.
Ezra,7,5,Bukki was the son of Abishua. Abishua was the son of Phinehas. Phinehas was the son of Eleazar. And Eleazar was the son of Aaron the chief priest.
Ezra,7,6,"So Ezra came up from Babylon. He was a teacher who knew the Law of Moses very well. The Lord , the God of Israel, had given Israel that law. The king had given Ezra everything he asked for. That’s because the Lord his God helped him."
Ezra,7,7,"Some of the Israelites came up to Jerusalem too. They included priests, Levites and musicians. They also included the temple servants and those who guarded the temple gates. It was in the seventh year that Artaxerxes was king."
Ezra,7,8,Ezra arrived in Jerusalem in the fifth month of the seventh year of the king’s rule.
Ezra,7,9,Ezra had begun his journey from Babylon on the first day of the first month. He arrived in Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month. That’s because God was gracious to him and helped him.
Ezra,7,10,Ezra had committed himself to study and obey the Law of the Lord . He also wanted to teach the Lord ’s rules and laws in Israel.
Ezra,7,11,"Ezra was a priest and teacher of the Law. He was an educated man. He knew the Lord ’s commands and rules for Israel very well. Here is a copy of a letter King Artaxerxes had given to Ezra. It said,"
Ezra,7,12,"I, Artaxerxes, am writing this letter. I am the greatest king of all. I have given it to Ezra the priest. He is the teacher of the Law of the God of heaven. I give you my greetings."
Ezra,7,13,"Ezra, I am giving an order about the Israelites in my kingdom. Any of them who want to go to Jerusalem with you may go. The order also allows priests and Levites to go with you."
Ezra,7,14,I and my seven advisers are sending you to see how things are going in Judah and Jerusalem. Find out whether the people there are obeying the Law of your God. You have a copy of that law with you.
Ezra,7,15,I and my advisers have freely given some silver and gold to the God of Israel. He is the God who lives in Jerusalem. Take that silver and gold with you.
Ezra,7,16,Also take any other silver and gold you can get from the land of Babylon. And take the offerings the people and priests choose to give for the temple of their God in Jerusalem.
Ezra,7,17,"Make sure you use the money to buy bulls, rams and male lambs. Also buy their grain offerings and drink offerings. Then sacrifice them on the altar of the temple of your God in Jerusalem."
Ezra,7,18,You and the other Jews can do what you think is best with the rest of the silver and gold. Do what your God wants you to do.
Ezra,7,19,Give to the God of Jerusalem all the things you are responsible for. Use them for worshiping your God in his temple.
Ezra,7,20,"You might need to supply some other things for the temple of your God. If you do, take them from among the royal treasures."
Ezra,7,21,"I, King Artaxerxes, also give this order. It applies to all those who are in charge of the treasures west of the Euphrates River. Make sure you provide anything Ezra the priest might ask you to give. He is the teacher of the Law of the God of heaven."
Ezra,7,22,Give Ezra up to three and three-fourths tons of silver. Give him up to 18 tons of wheat. Give him up to 600 gallons of wine and up to 600 gallons of olive oil. And give him as much salt as he needs.
Ezra,7,23,Work hard for the temple of the God of heaven. Do everything he has required. I don’t want him to be angry with my kingdom and the kingdom of my sons.
Ezra,7,24,"Here is something else I want you to know. You have no authority to collect taxes, gifts or fees from these people. You may not collect them from the priests, Levites or musicians. You may not collect them from those who guard the temple gates. You may not collect them from the temple servants. And you may not collect them from other workers at the house of God in Jerusalem."
Ezra,7,25,"Ezra, appoint judges and other court officials. When you do it, use the wisdom your God gives you. Those you appoint should do what is right and fair when they judge people. They should do it for everyone who lives west of the Euphrates River. They should do it for everyone who knows the laws of your God. And I want you to teach the people who don’t know those laws."
Ezra,7,26,Anyone who doesn’t obey the law of your God must be punished. The same thing applies to anyone who doesn’t obey my law. The people must be punished in keeping with the laws they have broken. Some of them must be put to death. Others must be forced to leave the places where they live. Others must have their property taken away from them. Still others must be put in prison.
Ezra,7,27,"So here is what I, Ezra, say to you people of Israel. “Give praise to the Lord . He is the God of our people who lived long ago. He has put it in the king’s heart to bring honor to the Lord ’s temple in Jerusalem. The king has honored the Lord in his letter."
Ezra,7,28,"The Lord has been kind to me. He has caused the king and his advisers to be kind to me. In fact, all the king’s powerful officials have been kind to me. The strong hand of the Lord my God helped me. That gave me new strength. So I gathered together leaders from Israel to go up to Jerusalem with me.”"
Ezra,8,1,Many family leaders came up to Jerusalem with me from Babylon. So did others who were listed with them. It was during the time when Artaxerxes was king. Here is a list of those who came.

Ezra,8,13,"Eliphelet, Jeuel and Shemaiah came from the family line of Adonikam. Some members of their family had gone up to Jerusalem before them. The total number of men with them was 60."
Ezra,8,14,Uthai and Zakkur came from the family line of Bigvai. The total number of men with them was 70.
Ezra,8,15,I gathered the people together at the canal that flows toward Ahava. We camped there for three days. I looked for Levites among the people and priests. But I didn’t find any.
Ezra,8,16,"So I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan and Jarib. I also sent for Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah and Meshullam. All of them were leaders. And I sent for Joiarib and Elnathan. They were very well educated."
Ezra,8,17,I ordered all those men to go to Iddo. He was the leader in Kasiphia. He and his Levite relatives were temple servants there. I told my men what to say to them. I wanted Iddo and his Levite relatives to bring some attendants to us for the house of our God.
Ezra,8,18,"God was gracious to us and helped us. So they brought us Sherebiah, a very capable man. He came from the family line of Mahli. Mahli was the son of Levi. Levi was a son of Israel. They also brought us Sherebiah’s sons and brothers. The total number of men was 18."
Ezra,8,19,And they brought Hashabiah and his brothers and nephews. They brought them together with Jeshaiah. He came from the family line of Merari. The total number of men was 20.
Ezra,8,20,They also brought 220 of the temple servants. That was a special group David and his officials had established. They were supposed to help the Levites. All of them were listed by name.
Ezra,8,21,"By the canal that flows toward Ahava, I announced a fast. I told the people not to eat any food. In that way, we made ourselves humble in God’s sight. We prayed that he would give us and our children a safe journey. We asked him to keep safe everything we owned."
Ezra,8,22,"I was ashamed to ask King Artaxerxes for soldiers and horsemen. They could have kept us safe from enemies on the road. But we had told the king that our God would keep us safe. We had said, “Our God is gracious and helps everyone who looks to him. But he becomes very angry with anyone who deserts him.”"
Ezra,8,23,So we didn’t eat anything. We prayed to our God about all these matters. And he answered our prayers.
Ezra,8,24,"Then I set apart 12 of the leading priests. They were Sherebiah, Hashabiah and ten of their relatives."
Ezra,8,25,"I weighed out to them the offering of silver and gold and other things. They had been given for the house of our God. The king, his advisers and officials, and all the Israelites who were there had given them."
Ezra,8,26,I weighed out 24 tons of silver and gave it to those men. I weighed out almost four tons of silver things. I weighed out almost four tons of gold.
Ezra,8,27,I weighed out 20 gold bowls. They weighed 19 pounds. I also weighed out two fine objects. The bronze they were made out of was highly polished. They were as priceless as gold.
Ezra,8,28,"I said to those men, “You are set apart to the Lord . So are these things. The silver and gold were offered to the Lord by those who chose to give them. He is the God of your people."
Ezra,8,29,Guard all these things carefully until you weigh them out. Weigh them in the special rooms of the Lord ’s temple in Jerusalem. Do this in front of the leading priests and the Levites. Make sure the family leaders of Israel are watching.”
Ezra,8,30,Then the priests and Levites received the silver and gold and sacred objects. All of them had been weighed out. They were going to be taken to the house of our God in Jerusalem.
Ezra,8,31,On the 12th day of the first month we started out. We left the canal that flows toward Ahava. And we headed for Jerusalem. Our God helped us. He kept us safe from enemies and robbers along the way.
Ezra,8,32,So we arrived in Jerusalem. There we rested for three days.
Ezra,8,33,"On the fourth day we weighed out the silver and gold. We also weighed out the sacred objects. We weighed everything in the house of our God. We handed all of it over to Meremoth the priest. He was the son of Uriah. Eleazar, Jozabad and Noadiah were with him. Eleazar was the son of Phinehas. Jozabad was the son of Jeshua. Noadiah was the son of Binnui. Jozabad and Noadiah were Levites."
Ezra,8,34,Everything was listed by number and weight. And the total weight was recorded at that time.
Ezra,8,35,Then the people sacrificed burnt offerings to the God of Israel. They had returned from Babylon. They offered 12 bulls for the whole nation of Israel. They offered 96 rams and 77 male lambs. All of that was a burnt offering to the Lord . They sacrificed 12 male goats as a sin offering.
Ezra,8,36,They also handed over the king’s orders. They gave them to the royal officials and governors who ruled over the land west of the Euphrates River. Then those men helped the people. They also did many things for the house of God.
Ezra,9,1,"After all these things had been done, the leaders came to me. They said, “The people of Israel have committed sins. Even the priests and Levites have sinned. They haven’t kept themselves separate from the nations around them. The Lord hates the practices of those nations. He hates what the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites and Jebusites do. He also hates what the Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians and Amorites do."
Ezra,9,2,"The men of Israel have married the daughters of some of those people. They’ve also taken some of those women for their sons to marry. So they’ve mixed our holy nation with the nations around us. We leaders and officials have also married women who don’t worship the Lord . By doing this, we have led the way in breaking our covenant with the Lord .”"
Ezra,9,3,"When I heard that, I tore my inner robe and my coat. I pulled hair from my head and beard. I was so shocked I sat down."
Ezra,9,4,Then everyone who trembled with fear at God’s words gathered around me. That’s because the people who had returned from Babylon had not been faithful. So I was very upset. I just sat there until the time of the evening sacrifice.
Ezra,9,5,Then I got up. I had been very sad for quite a while. My inner robe and my coat were torn. I fell down on my knees. I spread my hands out to the Lord my God.
Ezra,9,6,"I prayed, “I’m filled with shame and dishonor, my God. I can hardly look to you and pray. That’s because our sins are piled up above our heads. Our guilt reaches all the way to the heavens."
Ezra,9,7,We are filled with it. It has been like that ever since the days of our people who lived long ago. Kings of other countries have killed many of us and our kings and priests with their swords. They’ve forced others to leave their own land. They’ve taken them away as prisoners. They’ve robbed others. They’ve made still others feel ashamed and dishonored. All these things have happened to us because we’ve committed so many sins. And that’s how things still are to this day.
Ezra,9,8,“But you are the Lord our God. Now you have shown us your kindness for a short time. That’s because you have allowed a few of us to remain here. Your temple has given us new hope. So you have made things easier for us. You have given us a little rest from our slavery.
Ezra,9,9,We are still slaves. But you are our God. You haven’t turned away from us. You haven’t left us in our slavery. You have been kind to us. The kings of Persia have seen it. You have given us new life to repair your temple and rebuild it. You have given us a place of safety in Judah and Jerusalem.
Ezra,9,10,“You are our God. What can we say after the way you have blessed us? We have turned away from your commands.
Ezra,9,11,"You gave us your commands through your servants the prophets. You said, ‘You are entering the land to take it as your own. The sinful practices of its people have made the land impure. They have filled it with their “unclean” acts from one end to the other. The Lord hates all their practices."
Ezra,9,12,So don’t let your daughters marry their sons. And don’t let their daughters marry your sons. Don’t make a peace treaty with them at any time. Then you will be strong. You will eat the good things the land produces. And you will leave all of it to your children as their share. They and their children after them will enjoy it forever.’
Ezra,9,13,"“Our evil acts and our terrible sins have brought about the things that have happened to us. You are our God. Because we sinned so much, you should have punished us even more than you have. But you have left many of your people alive."
Ezra,9,14,"Suppose we don’t obey your commands again. And suppose we continue to marry people who commit sins that you hate. If we do, you will be so angry with us that you will destroy us. You won’t leave us even a few people. You won’t leave anyone alive."
Ezra,9,15,"Lord , you are the God of Israel. You are holy. You always do what is right. Today you have left many of your people alive. Here we are with all our guilt. You see the guilt of our sin. Because we have sinned, not one of us can stand in front of you.”"
Ezra,10,1,"Ezra was praying and admitting to God that his people had sinned. He was weeping and throwing himself down in front of the house of God. Then a large crowd of Israelites gathered around him. Men, women and children were there. They too wept bitterly."
Ezra,10,2,"Shekaniah spoke to Ezra. Shekaniah was the son of Jehiel. He belonged to the family line of Elam. Shekaniah said, “We haven’t been faithful to our God. We’ve married women from the nations around us. In spite of that, there is still hope for Israel."
Ezra,10,3,So let’s make a covenant in front of our God. Let’s promise to send away all these women and their children. That’s what you have advised us to do. Those who respect our God’s commands have given us the same advice. We want to do what the Law says.
Ezra,10,4,"Get up, Ezra. This matter is in your hands. Do what you need to. We will be behind you all the way. Be brave and do it.”"
Ezra,10,5,So Ezra got up. He made the leading priests and Levites and all the Israelites make a promise. He made them promise they would do what Shekaniah had suggested. And they made that promise.
Ezra,10,6,"Then Ezra left the house of God. He went to Jehohanan’s room. Jehohanan was the son of Eliashib. While Ezra was there, he didn’t eat any food. He didn’t drink any water. That’s because he was filled with sadness. He mourned because the people weren’t faithful to the Lord ’s commands. Those people were the ones who had returned from the land of Babylon."
Ezra,10,7,Then an announcement was sent all through Judah and Jerusalem. All the people who had returned were told to gather together in Jerusalem.
Ezra,10,8,"They were supposed to come there before three days had passed. If they didn’t, they would lose all their property. They would also be removed from the community of those who had returned. That’s what the officials and elders had decided."
Ezra,10,9,"Before the three days were over, all the men of Judah and Benjamin had gathered together in Jerusalem. It was the 20th day of the ninth month. They were sitting in the open area in front of the house of God. They were very upset by what they knew would happen. And they were upset because it was raining."
Ezra,10,10,"Then Ezra the priest stood up. He said, “You haven’t been faithful to the Lord . You have married women from other lands. So you have added to Israel’s guilt."
Ezra,10,11,"Now honor the Lord , the God of your people. Then do what he wants you to do. Separate yourselves from the nations around you. Send away your wives from other lands.”"
Ezra,10,12,"The whole community answered with a loud voice. They said, “You are right! We must do as you say."
Ezra,10,13,"But there are a lot of people here. And it’s the rainy season. So we can’t stand outside. Besides, this matter can’t be taken care of in just a day or two. That’s because we have sinned terribly by what we’ve done."
Ezra,10,14,Our officials can act for the whole community. Have everyone in our towns who has married a woman from another land come at a certain time. Tell them to come together with the elders and judges of each town. Then our God will no longer be angry with us concerning this whole matter.”
Ezra,10,15,Only a few men opposed that. They included Jonathan and Jahzeiah. Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite joined them. Jonathan was the son of Asahel. Jahzeiah was the son of Tikvah.
Ezra,10,16,So those who had returned did what had been suggested. Ezra the priest chose some family leaders. There was one from each family group. All of them were chosen by name. They sat down to check out each case. They started on the first day of the tenth month.
Ezra,10,17,By the first day of the first month they were finished. They had handled all the cases of the men who had married women from other lands.
Ezra,10,18,"Among the family lines of the priests, here are the men who had married women from other lands. Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib and Gedaliah came from the family line of Joshua and his brothers. Joshua was the son of Jozadak."
Ezra,10,19,All of them made a firm promise to send their wives away. Each of these men brought a ram from his flock as a guilt offering.
Ezra,10,20,Hanani and Zebadiah came from the family line of Immer.

Ezra,10,44,All these men had married women from other lands. Some of them had even had children by those wives.
