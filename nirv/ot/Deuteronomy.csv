Deuteronomy,1,1,"These are the words Moses spoke to all the Israelites. At that time, they were in the desert east of the Jordan River. It’s in the Arabah Valley across from Suph. The people were between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth and Dizahab."
Deuteronomy,1,2,It takes 11 days to go from Mount Horeb to Kadesh Barnea if you travel on the Mount Seir road.
Deuteronomy,1,3,"It was the 40th year since the Israelites had left Egypt. On the first day of the 11th month, Moses spoke to them. He told them everything the Lord had commanded him to tell them."
Deuteronomy,1,4,They had already won the battle over Sihon. Sihon was the king of the Amorites. He had ruled in Heshbon. Israel had also won the battle over Og at Edrei. Og was the king of Bashan. He had ruled in Ashtaroth.
Deuteronomy,1,5,The people were east of the Jordan River in the territory of Moab. There Moses began to explain the law. Here is what he said.
Deuteronomy,1,6,"The Lord our God spoke to us at Mount Horeb. He said, “You have stayed long enough at this mountain."
Deuteronomy,1,7,Take your tents down. Go into the hill country of the Amorites. Go to all the people who are their neighbors. Go to the people who live in the Arabah Valley. Travel to the mountains and the western hills. Go to the people in the Negev Desert and along the coast. Travel to the land of Canaan and to Lebanon. Go as far as the great Euphrates River.
Deuteronomy,1,8,"I have given you all this land. Go in and take it as your own. The Lord promised he would give the land to your fathers. He promised it to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. He also said he would give it to their children after them.”"
Deuteronomy,1,9,"At that time I spoke to you. I said, “You are too heavy a load for me to carry alone."
Deuteronomy,1,10,The Lord your God has caused there to be many of you. Today you are as many as the stars in the sky.
Deuteronomy,1,11,"The Lord is the God of your people. May he cause there to be a thousand times more of you. May he bless you, just as he promised he would."
Deuteronomy,1,12,But I can’t handle your problems and troubles all by myself. I can’t settle your arguments.
Deuteronomy,1,13,So choose some wise men from each of your tribes. They must understand how to give good advice. The people must have respect for them. I will appoint those men to have authority over you.”
Deuteronomy,1,14,"You answered me, “Your suggestion is good.”"
Deuteronomy,1,15,"So I chose the leading men of your tribes who were wise and respected. I appointed them to have authority over you. I made them commanders of thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens. I appointed them to be officials over the tribes."
Deuteronomy,1,16,"Here is what I commanded your judges at that time. I said, “Listen to your people’s cases when they argue with one another. Judge them fairly. It doesn’t matter whether the case is between two Israelites or between an Israelite and an outsider living among you."
Deuteronomy,1,17,"When you judge them, treat everyone the same. Listen to those who are important and those who are not. Don’t be afraid of anyone. God is the highest judge. Bring me any case that is too hard for you. I’ll listen to it.”"
Deuteronomy,1,18,At that time I told you everything you should do.
Deuteronomy,1,19,"The Lord our God commanded us to start out from Mount Horeb. So we did. We went toward the hill country of the Amorites. We traveled all through the huge and terrible desert you saw. Finally, we reached Kadesh Barnea."
Deuteronomy,1,20,"Then I said to you, “You have reached the hill country of the Amorites. The Lord our God is giving it to us."
Deuteronomy,1,21,The Lord your God has given you the land. Go up and take it. Do what the Lord says. He’s the God of your people. Don’t be afraid. Don’t lose hope.”
Deuteronomy,1,22,"Then all of you came to me. You said, “Let’s send some men ahead of us. They can check out the land for us and bring back a report. They can suggest to us which way to go. They can tell us about the towns we’ll come to.”"
Deuteronomy,1,23,That seemed like a good idea to me. So I chose 12 of you. I picked one man from each tribe.
Deuteronomy,1,24,They left and went up into the hill country. There they came to the Valley of Eshkol. They checked it out.
Deuteronomy,1,25,"They got some of the fruit of that land. Then they brought it down to us and gave us their report. They said, “The Lord our God is giving us a good land.”"
Deuteronomy,1,26,But you wouldn’t go up. You refused to obey the command of the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy,1,27,"You spoke against him in your tents. You said, “The Lord hates us. That’s why he brought us out of Egypt to hand us over to the Amorites. He wanted to destroy us."
Deuteronomy,1,28,"Where can we go? The men who checked out the land have made us afraid. They say, ‘The people are stronger and taller than we are. The cities are large. They have walls that reach up to the sky. We even saw the Anakites there.’ ”"
Deuteronomy,1,29,"Then I said to you, “Don’t be terrified. Don’t be afraid of them."
Deuteronomy,1,30,The Lord your God will go ahead of you. He will fight for you. With your own eyes you saw how he fought for you in Egypt.
Deuteronomy,1,31,"You also saw how the Lord your God brought you through the desert. He carried you everywhere you went, just as a father carries his son. And now you have arrived here.”"
Deuteronomy,1,32,"In spite of that, you didn’t trust in the Lord your God."
Deuteronomy,1,33,He went ahead of you on your journey. He was in the fire at night and in the cloud during the day. He found places for you to camp. He showed you the way you should go.
Deuteronomy,1,34,"The Lord heard what you said. So he became angry. He made a promise. He said,"
Deuteronomy,1,35,“I promised to give this good land to your people of long ago. But no one alive today will see it.
Deuteronomy,1,36,Only Caleb will see the land. He is the son of Jephunneh. I will give him and his children after him the land he walked on. He followed me with his whole heart.”
Deuteronomy,1,37,"Because of you, the Lord became angry with me also. He said, “You will not enter the land either."
Deuteronomy,1,38,"But Joshua, the son of Nun, is your helper. Joshua will enter the land. Help him to be brave. Give him hope. He will lead Israel to take the land as their own."
Deuteronomy,1,39,You said your little ones would be taken prisoner. But they will enter the land. They do not yet know right from wrong. But I will give them the land. They will take it as their own.
Deuteronomy,1,40,"As for you, turn around. Start out toward the desert. Go along the road that leads to the Red Sea.”"
Deuteronomy,1,41,"Then you replied, “We have sinned against the Lord . We will go up and fight. We’ll do just as the Lord our God has commanded us.” So all of you got your swords and put them on. You thought it would be easy to go up into the hill country."
Deuteronomy,1,42,"But the Lord spoke to me. He said, “Tell them, ‘Do not go up and fight. I will not be with you. Your enemies will win the battle over you.’ ”"
Deuteronomy,1,43,So I told you what the Lord said. But you wouldn’t listen. You refused to obey his command. You were so filled with pride that you marched up into the hill country.
Deuteronomy,1,44,The Amorites who lived in those hills came out and attacked you. Like large numbers of bees they chased you. They beat you down from Seir all the way to Hormah.
Deuteronomy,1,45,You came back and wept in front of the Lord . But he didn’t pay any attention to your weeping. He wouldn’t listen to you.
Deuteronomy,1,46,So you stayed in Kadesh for many years. You spent a long time in that area.
Deuteronomy,2,1,We turned back and started out toward the desert. We went along the road that leads to the Red Sea. That’s how the Lord had directed me. For a long time we made our way around the hill country of Seir.
Deuteronomy,2,2,"Then the Lord spoke to me. He said,"
Deuteronomy,2,3,“You have made your way around this hill country long enough. So now turn north.
Deuteronomy,2,4,"Here are the orders I want you to give the people. Tell them, ‘You are about to pass through the territory of your relatives. They are from the family line of Esau. They live in Seir. They will be afraid of you. But be very careful."
Deuteronomy,2,5,"Do not make them angry. If you do, they will go to war against you. I will not give you any of their land. You will not have even enough to put your foot on. I have given Esau’s people the hill country of Seir as their own."
Deuteronomy,2,6,Pay them with silver for the food you eat and the water you drink.’ ”
Deuteronomy,2,7,The Lord your God has blessed you in everything your hands have done. He watched over you when you traveled through that huge desert. For these 40 years the Lord your God has been with you. So you have had everything you need.
Deuteronomy,2,8,We went on past our relatives. They are from the family line of Esau. They live in Seir. We turned away from the Arabah Valley road. It comes up from Elath and Ezion Geber. We traveled along the desert road of Moab.
Deuteronomy,2,9,"Then the Lord said to me, “Do not attack the Moabites. Do not even make them angry. If you do, they will go to war against you. I will not give you any part of their land. I have given Moab to the people in the family line of Lot. I have given it to them as their own.”"
Deuteronomy,2,10,The Emites used to live there. They were strong people. There were large numbers of them. They were as tall as the Anakites.
Deuteronomy,2,11,"Like the Anakites, they too were thought of as Rephaites. But the Moabites called them Emites."
Deuteronomy,2,12,The Horites used to live in Seir. But the people of Esau drove them out. They destroyed the Horites to make room for themselves. Then they settled in their territory. They did just as Israel has done in the land the Lord gave them as their own.
Deuteronomy,2,13,"The Lord said, “Now get up. Go across the Zered Valley.” So we went across it."
Deuteronomy,2,14,"Between the time we left Kadesh Barnea and the time we went across the Zered Valley, 38 years had passed. By then, all the fighting men who had been in our camp from the beginning had died. The Lord had warned them that it would happen."
Deuteronomy,2,15,He used his power against them until he had gotten rid of all of them. Not one was left in the camp.
Deuteronomy,2,16,"Finally, the last of the fighting men among the people died."
Deuteronomy,2,17,"Then the Lord said to me,"
Deuteronomy,2,18,“Today you must pass near the border of Moab. Moab is also called Ar.
Deuteronomy,2,19,"When you come to the Ammonites, do not attack them. Do not make them angry. If you do, they will go to war against you. I will not give you any of their land as your own. I have given it to the people in the family line of Lot. I have given it to them as their own.”"
Deuteronomy,2,20,That land was also thought of as a land of the Rephaites. They used to live there. But the Ammonites called them Zamzummites.
Deuteronomy,2,21,The Rephaites were strong people. There were large numbers of them. They were as tall as the Anakites. The Lord destroyed the Rephaites to make room for the Ammonites. So the Ammonites drove them out. Then they settled in the territory of the Rephaites.
Deuteronomy,2,22,The Lord had done the same thing for the people of Esau. They lived in Seir. The Lord destroyed the Horites to make room for Esau’s people. They drove the Horites out. So the people of Esau have lived in Seir in the territory of the Horites to this very day.
Deuteronomy,2,23,The Avvites lived in villages as far away as Gaza. But people came from Crete and destroyed the Avvites. Then the people of Crete made their home in the territory of the Avvites.
Deuteronomy,2,24,"The Lord said, “Start out and go across the valley of the Arnon River. I have handed Sihon over to you. He is the Amorite king of Heshbon. I have also given you his country. Begin to take it as your own. Go to war against him."
Deuteronomy,2,25,This very day I will bring fear and terror on all the nations because of you. They will hear about you. They will tremble with fear. Pain and suffering will grip them because of you.”
Deuteronomy,2,26,"I sent messengers from the Desert of Kedemoth. I told them to go to Sihon, the king of Heshbon. They offered him peace. They said,"
Deuteronomy,2,27,“Let us pass through your country. We’ll stay on the main road. We won’t turn off it to one side or the other.
Deuteronomy,2,28,We’ll pay you the right amount of silver for food to eat and water to drink. Just let us walk through your country.
Deuteronomy,2,29,"The people of Esau, who live in Seir, allowed us to do that. The people of Moab, who live in Ar, also allowed us to do it. So let us walk through until we go across the Jordan River. Then we’ll be able to go into the land the Lord our God is giving us.”"
Deuteronomy,2,30,"But Sihon, the king of Heshbon, refused to let us walk through. The Lord your God had made him stubborn in his heart and spirit. The Lord wanted to hand him over to you. And that’s exactly what he has done."
Deuteronomy,2,31,"The Lord said to me, “I have begun to hand Sihon and his country over to you. So begin the battle to take his land as your own.”"
Deuteronomy,2,32,Sihon and his whole army came out to fight against us at Jahaz.
Deuteronomy,2,33,But the Lord our God handed him over to us. We struck him down together with his sons and his whole army.
Deuteronomy,2,34,"At that time we took all his towns. We completely destroyed them. We killed all the men, women and children. We didn’t leave any of them alive."
Deuteronomy,2,35,But we took for ourselves the livestock and everything else from the towns we had captured.
Deuteronomy,2,36,Not a single town was too strong for us. That includes all the towns from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon River valley all the way to Gilead. It also includes the town in the valley. The Lord our God gave us all of them.
Deuteronomy,2,37,And you obeyed the Lord ’s command. You didn’t go near any part of the land of the Ammonites. That includes the land along the Jabbok River. It also includes the land around the towns in the hills.
Deuteronomy,3,1,"Next, we turned and went up along the road toward Bashan. Og marched out with his whole army. They fought against us at Edrei. Og was the king of Bashan."
Deuteronomy,3,2,"The Lord said to me, “Do not be afraid of Og. I have handed him over to you. I have also handed over his whole army and his land. Do to him what you did to Sihon. Sihon was the Amorite king who ruled in Heshbon.”"
Deuteronomy,3,3,"So the Lord our God also handed Og, the king of Bashan, and his whole army over to us. We struck them down. We didn’t leave any of them alive."
Deuteronomy,3,4,At that time we took all his cities. There were 60 of them. We took the whole area of Argob. That was Og’s kingdom in Bashan.
Deuteronomy,3,5,All those cities had high walls around them. The city gates were made secure with heavy metal bars. There were also large numbers of villages that didn’t have walls.
Deuteronomy,3,6,"We completely destroyed them. We did to them just as we had done to Sihon, the king of Heshbon. We destroyed all their cities. We destroyed the men, women and children."
Deuteronomy,3,7,But we kept for ourselves the livestock and everything else we took from their cities.
Deuteronomy,3,8,So at that time we took the territory east of the Jordan River. We captured it from those two Amorite kings. The territory goes all the way from the Arnon River valley to Mount Hermon.
Deuteronomy,3,9,Hermon is called Sirion by the people of Sidon. The Amorites call it Senir.
Deuteronomy,3,10,We captured all the towns on the high plains. We took the whole land of Gilead. And we captured the whole land of Bashan as far away as Salekah and Edrei. Those were towns that belonged to Og’s kingdom in Bashan.
Deuteronomy,3,11,"Og, the king of Bashan, was the only Rephaite left. His bed was decorated with iron. It was more than 13 feet long and six feet wide. It is still in the Ammonite city of Rabbah."
Deuteronomy,3,12,I divided up the land we took over at that time. I gave the tribes of Reuben and Gad the territory north of Aroer by the Arnon River valley. It includes half of the hill country of Gilead together with its towns.
Deuteronomy,3,13,"I gave the rest of Gilead to half of the tribe of Manasseh. I also gave them the whole land of Bashan, the kingdom of Og. The whole area of Argob in Bashan used to be known as a land of the Rephaites."
Deuteronomy,3,14,Jair took the whole area of Argob. He was from the family line of Manasseh. Argob goes all the way to the border of the people of Geshur and Maakah. It was named after Jair. So Bashan is called Havvoth Jair to this very day.
Deuteronomy,3,15,I gave Gilead to Makir.
Deuteronomy,3,16,But I gave to the tribes of Reuben and Gad the territory that reaches from Gilead down to the Arnon River valley. It goes all the way to the Jabbok River. The Jabbok is the northern border of Ammon. The middle of the Arnon River valley is its southern border.
Deuteronomy,3,17,The western border of Reuben and Gad is the Jordan River in the Arabah Valley. It reaches from the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea. It runs below the slopes of Pisgah.
Deuteronomy,3,18,"Here is the command I gave at that time to the tribes of Reuben and Gad and half of the tribe of Manasseh. I said, “The Lord your God has given you this land as your very own. But all your strong men must be prepared for battle. They must cross over ahead of the rest of the Israelites."
Deuteronomy,3,19,But your wives and children can stay in the towns I’ve given you. You can keep your livestock there too. I know you have a lot of livestock.
Deuteronomy,3,20,"The Lord has given you peace and rest. Then let your families and livestock stay in those towns until the Lord gives peace and rest to the other tribes. And let your families stay until the other tribes have taken over the land the Lord your God is giving them. That land is across the Jordan River. After that, each of you may go back to the land I’ve given you as your very own.”"
Deuteronomy,3,21,"At that time I gave Joshua a command. I said, “Your own eyes have seen everything the Lord your God has done to Sihon and Og. He will do the same thing to all the kingdoms in the land where you are going."
Deuteronomy,3,22,Don’t be afraid of them. The Lord your God himself will fight for you.”
Deuteronomy,3,23,"At that time I made my appeal to the Lord . I said,"
Deuteronomy,3,24,"“ Lord and King, you have begun to show me how great you are. You have shown me how strong your hand is. You do great works and mighty acts. There isn’t any god in heaven or on earth who can do what you do."
Deuteronomy,3,25,Let me go across the Jordan River. Let me see the good land beyond it. I want to see that fine hill country and Lebanon.”
Deuteronomy,3,26,But the Lord was angry with me because of what you did. He wouldn’t listen to me. “That is enough!” the Lord said. “Do not speak to me anymore about this matter.
Deuteronomy,3,27,Go up to the highest slopes of Pisgah. Look west and north and south and east. Look at the land with your own eyes. But you are not going to go across this Jordan River.
Deuteronomy,3,28,So appoint Joshua as the new leader. Help him to be brave. Give him hope and strength. He will take these people across the Jordan. You will see the land. But he will lead them into it to take it as their own.”
Deuteronomy,3,29,So we stayed in the valley near Beth Peor.
Deuteronomy,4,1,"Now, Israel, listen to the rules and laws I’m going to teach you. Obey them and you will live. You will go in and take over the land. The Lord was the God of your people of long ago. He’s giving you the land."
Deuteronomy,4,2,"Don’t add to what I’m commanding you. Don’t subtract from it either. Instead, obey the commands of the Lord your God that I’m giving you."
Deuteronomy,4,3,Your own eyes saw what the Lord your God did at Baal Peor. He destroyed every one of your people who worshiped the Baal that was worshiped at Peor.
Deuteronomy,4,4,But all of you who remained true to the Lord your God are still alive today.
Deuteronomy,4,5,"I have taught you rules and laws, just as the Lord my God commanded me. Obey them in the land you are entering to take as your very own."
Deuteronomy,4,6,"Be careful to keep them. That will show the nations how wise and understanding you are. They will hear about all these rules. They’ll say, “That great nation certainly has wise and understanding people.”"
Deuteronomy,4,7,The Lord our God is near us every time we pray to him. What other nation is great enough to have its gods that close to them?
Deuteronomy,4,8,I’m giving you the laws of the Lord today. What other nation is great enough to have rules and laws as fair as these?
Deuteronomy,4,9,"Don’t be careless. Instead, be very careful. Don’t forget the things your eyes have seen. As long as you live, don’t let them slip from your mind. Teach them to your children and their children after them."
Deuteronomy,4,10,"Remember the day you stood at Mount Horeb. The Lord your God was there. He said to me, “Bring the people to me to hear my words. I want them to learn to have respect for me as long as they live in the land. I want them to teach my words to their children.”"
Deuteronomy,4,11,You came near and stood at the foot of the mountain. It blazed with fire that reached as high as the very heavens. There were black clouds and deep darkness.
Deuteronomy,4,12,Then the Lord spoke to you out of the fire. You heard the sound of his words. But you didn’t see any shape or form. You only heard a voice.
Deuteronomy,4,13,He announced his covenant to you. That covenant is the Ten Commandments. He commanded you to obey them. Then he wrote them down on two stone tablets.
Deuteronomy,4,14,At that time the Lord directed me to teach you his rules and laws. You must obey them in the land you are crossing the Jordan River to take as your own.
Deuteronomy,4,15,The Lord spoke to you at Mount Horeb out of the fire. But you didn’t see any shape or form that day. So be very careful.
Deuteronomy,4,16,Make sure you don’t commit a horrible sin. Don’t make for yourselves a statue of a god. Don’t make a god that looks like a man or woman or anything else.
Deuteronomy,4,17,Don’t make one that looks like any animal on earth or any bird that flies in the sky.
Deuteronomy,4,18,Don’t make a statue that looks like any creature that moves along the ground or any fish that swims in the water.
Deuteronomy,4,19,"When you look up at the heavens, you will see the sun and moon. And you will see huge numbers of stars. Don’t let anyone tempt you to bow down to the sun, moon or stars. Don’t worship things the Lord your God has provided for all the nations on earth."
Deuteronomy,4,20,Egypt was like a furnace that melts iron down and makes it pure. But the Lord took you and brought you out of Egypt. He wanted you to be his very own people. And that’s exactly what you are.
Deuteronomy,4,21,The Lord was angry with me because of what you did. He promised that he would never let me go across the Jordan River. He promised that I would never enter that good land. It’s the land the Lord your God is giving you as your own.
Deuteronomy,4,22,I’ll die here in this land. I won’t go across the Jordan. But you are about to cross over it. You will take that good land as your own.
Deuteronomy,4,23,Be careful. Don’t forget the covenant the Lord your God made with you. Don’t make for yourselves a statue of any god at all. He has told you not to. So don’t do it.
Deuteronomy,4,24,The Lord your God is like a fire that burns everything up. He wants you to worship only him.
Deuteronomy,4,25,"So don’t make a statue of a god. Don’t commit that horrible sin. Don’t do it even after you have had children and grandchildren. Don’t do it even after you have lived in the land a long time. If you do, that will be an evil thing in the sight of the Lord your God. You will make him angry."
Deuteronomy,4,26,Today I’m calling out to the heavens and the earth to be witnesses against you. Suppose you do these things. Then you will quickly die in the land you are going across the Jordan River to take over. You won’t live there very long. You will certainly be destroyed.
Deuteronomy,4,27,The Lord will drive you out of your land. He will scatter you among the nations. Only a few of you will remain alive there.
Deuteronomy,4,28,"There you will worship gods that men have made out of wood and stone. Those gods can’t see, hear, eat or smell."
Deuteronomy,4,29,"Perhaps while you are there, you will seek the Lord your God. You will find him if you seek him with all your heart and with all your soul."
Deuteronomy,4,30,All the things I’ve told you about might happen to you. And you will be in trouble. But later you will return to the Lord your God. You will obey him.
Deuteronomy,4,31,The Lord your God is tender and loving. He won’t leave you or destroy you. He won’t forget the covenant he made with your people of long ago. He gave his word when he made it.
Deuteronomy,4,32,Ask now about the days of long ago. Find out what happened long before your time. Ask about what has happened since the time God created human beings on the earth. Ask from one end of the world to the other. Has anything as great as this ever happened? Has anything like it ever been heard of?
Deuteronomy,4,33,You heard the voice of God speaking out of fire. And you lived! Has that happened to any other people?
Deuteronomy,4,34,Has any god ever tried to take one nation out of another to be his own? Has any god done it by testing his people? Has any god done it with signs and amazing deeds or with war? Has any god reached out his mighty hand and powerful arm? Or has any god shown his people his great and wonderful acts? The Lord your God did all those things for you in Egypt. With your very own eyes you saw him do them.
Deuteronomy,4,35,The Lord showed you those things so that you might know he is God. There is no other God except him.
Deuteronomy,4,36,From heaven he made you hear his voice. He wanted to teach you. On earth he showed you his great fire. You heard his words coming out of the fire.
Deuteronomy,4,37,He loved your people of long ago. He chose their children after them. So he brought you out of Egypt. He used his great strength to do it.
Deuteronomy,4,38,He drove out nations to make room for you. They were greater and stronger than you are. He will bring you into their land. He wants to give it to you as your very own. The whole land is as good as yours right now.
Deuteronomy,4,39,The Lord is God in heaven above and on the earth below. Today you must agree with that and take it to heart. There is no other God.
Deuteronomy,4,40,I’m giving you his rules and commands today. Obey them. Then things will go well with you and your children after you. You will live a long time in the land. The Lord your God is giving you the land for all time to come.
Deuteronomy,4,41,Then Moses set apart three cities east of the Jordan River.
Deuteronomy,4,42,Suppose someone killed a person they didn’t hate and without meaning to do it. That person could run to one of those cities and stay alive.
Deuteronomy,4,43,Here are the names of the cities. Bezer was for the people of Reuben. It was in the high plains in the desert. Ramoth was for the people of Gad. It was in Gilead. Golan was for the people of Manasseh. It was in Bashan.
Deuteronomy,4,44,Here is the law Moses gave the Israelites.
Deuteronomy,4,45,"Here are its terms, rules and laws. Moses gave them to the people when they came out of Egypt."
Deuteronomy,4,46,"They were now east of the Jordan River in the valley near Beth Peor. They were in the land of Sihon, the king of the Amorites. He ruled in Heshbon. But Moses and the Israelites won the battle over him after we came out of Egypt."
Deuteronomy,4,47,"They captured his land and made it their own. They also took the land of Og, the king of Bashan. Sihon and Og were the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan River."
Deuteronomy,4,48,Their land reached from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon River valley to Mount Hermon.
Deuteronomy,4,49,It included the whole Arabah Valley east of the Jordan. It included land all the way to the Dead Sea below the slopes of Pisgah.
Deuteronomy,5,1,"Moses sent for all the Israelites. Here is what he said to them. Israel, listen to me. Here are the rules and laws I’m announcing to you today. Learn them well. Be sure to obey them."
Deuteronomy,5,2,The Lord our God made a covenant with us at Mount Horeb.
Deuteronomy,5,3,"He didn’t make it only with our people of long ago. He also made it with us. In fact, he made it with all of us who are alive here today."
Deuteronomy,5,4,The Lord spoke to you face to face. His voice came out of the fire on the mountain.
Deuteronomy,5,5,"At that time I stood between the Lord and you. I announced to you the Lord ’s message. I did it because you were afraid of the fire. You didn’t go up the mountain. The Lord said,"
Deuteronomy,5,6,“I am the Lord your God. I brought you out of Egypt. That is the land where you were slaves.
Deuteronomy,5,7,“Do not put any other gods in place of me.
Deuteronomy,5,8,“Do not make statues of gods that look like anything in the sky or on the earth or in the waters.
Deuteronomy,5,9,Do not bow down to them or worship them. I am the Lord your God. I want you to worship only me. I cause the sins of the parents to affect their children. I will cause the sins of those who hate me to affect even their grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
Deuteronomy,5,10,But for all time to come I show love to all those who love me and keep my commandments.
Deuteronomy,5,11,“Do not misuse the name of the Lord your God. The Lord will find guilty anyone who misuses his name.
Deuteronomy,5,12,“Keep the Sabbath day holy. Do this just as the Lord your God has commanded you.
Deuteronomy,5,13,Do all your work in six days.
Deuteronomy,5,14,"But the seventh day is a sabbath to honor the Lord your God. Do not do any work on that day. The same command applies to your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, your oxen, your donkeys and your other animals. It also applies to any outsiders who live in your towns. I want your male and female servants to rest, just as you do."
Deuteronomy,5,15,Remember that you were slaves in Egypt. The Lord your God reached out his mighty hand and powerful arm and brought you out of there. So the Lord your God has commanded you to keep the Sabbath day holy.
Deuteronomy,5,16,"“Honor your father and mother, just as the Lord your God has commanded you. Then you will live a long time in the land he is giving you. And things will go well with you there."
Deuteronomy,5,17,“Do not murder.
Deuteronomy,5,18,“Do not commit adultery.
Deuteronomy,5,19,“Do not steal.
Deuteronomy,5,20,“Do not be a false witness against your neighbor.
Deuteronomy,5,21,"“Do not want to have your neighbor’s wife. Do not desire anything your neighbor owns. Do not desire to have your neighbor’s house or land, male or female servant, ox or donkey.”"
Deuteronomy,5,22,"These are the commandments the Lord announced in a loud voice to your whole community. He gave them to you there on the mountain. He spoke out of the fire, cloud and deep darkness. He didn’t add anything else. Then he wrote the commandments on two stone tablets. And he gave them to me."
Deuteronomy,5,23,The mountain was blazing with fire. You heard the voice coming out of the darkness. So your elders and all the leaders of your tribes came to me.
Deuteronomy,5,24,"You said, “The Lord our God has shown us his glory and majesty. We have heard his voice coming out of the fire. Today we have seen that a person can still stay alive even if God speaks with them."
Deuteronomy,5,25,But why should we die? This great fire will burn us up. We’ll die if we hear the voice of the Lord our God again.
Deuteronomy,5,26,We have heard the voice of the living God. We’ve heard him speaking out of the fire. Has any other human being ever heard him speak like that and stayed alive?
Deuteronomy,5,27,Go near and listen to everything the Lord our God says. Then tell us what he tells you. We will listen and obey.”
Deuteronomy,5,28,"The Lord heard you when you spoke to me. He said to me, “I have heard what these people said to you. Everything they said was good."
Deuteronomy,5,29,But I wish they would always have respect for me in their hearts. I wish they would always obey all my commands. Then things would go well with them and their children forever.
Deuteronomy,5,30,“Go and tell them to return to their tents.
Deuteronomy,5,31,"But you stay here with me. Then I will give you all my commands, rules and laws. You must teach the people to obey them in the land I am giving them as their very own.”"
Deuteronomy,5,32,So be careful to do what the Lord your God has commanded you. Don’t turn away from his commands to the right or the left.
Deuteronomy,5,33,Live exactly as the Lord your God has commanded you to live. Then you will enjoy life in the land you will soon own. Things will go well with you there. You will live there for a long time.
Deuteronomy,6,1,"The Lord your God has directed me to teach you his commands, rules and laws. Obey them in the land you will take over when you go across the Jordan River."
Deuteronomy,6,2,"Then you, your children and their children after them will honor the Lord your God as long as you live. Obey all his rules and commands I’m giving you. If you do, you will enjoy long life."
Deuteronomy,6,3,"Israel, listen to me. Make sure you obey me. Then things will go well with you. The number of your people will increase greatly in a land that has plenty of milk and honey. That’s what the Lord , the God of your parents, promised you."
Deuteronomy,6,4,"Israel, listen to me. The Lord is our God. The Lord is the one and only God."
Deuteronomy,6,5,Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul. Love him with all your strength.
Deuteronomy,6,6,The commandments I give you today must be in your hearts.
Deuteronomy,6,7,Make sure your children learn them. Talk about them when you are at home. Talk about them when you walk along the road. Speak about them when you go to bed. And speak about them when you get up.
Deuteronomy,6,8,Write them down and tie them on your hands as a reminder. Also tie them on your foreheads.
Deuteronomy,6,9,Write them on the doorframes of your houses. Also write them on your gates.
Deuteronomy,6,10,"The Lord your God will bring you into the land of Canaan. He gave his word. He promised he would give the land to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. The land has large, wealthy cities you didn’t build."
Deuteronomy,6,11,It has houses filled with all kinds of good things you didn’t provide. The land has wells you didn’t dig. And it has vineyards and groves of olive trees you didn’t plant. You will have plenty to eat.
Deuteronomy,6,12,But be careful that you don’t forget the Lord . Remember that he brought you out of Egypt. That’s the land where you were slaves.
Deuteronomy,6,13,"Worship the Lord your God. He is the only one you should serve. When you make promises, do so in his name."
Deuteronomy,6,14,Don’t serve the gods of the nations around you.
Deuteronomy,6,15,"The Lord your God is among you. He wants you to worship only him. If you worship other gods, God will be very angry with you. And he will destroy you from the face of the land."
Deuteronomy,6,16,Don’t test the Lord your God as you did at Massah.
Deuteronomy,6,17,Be sure to obey the Lord ’s commands. Obey the terms and rules he has given you.
Deuteronomy,6,18,Do what is right and good in the Lord ’s eyes. Then things will go well with you. You will go in and take over the land. It’s the good land the Lord promised to your people of long ago.
Deuteronomy,6,19,You will drive out all your enemies to make room for you. That’s what the Lord said would happen.
Deuteronomy,6,20,"Later on, your child might ask you, “What is the meaning of the terms, rules and laws the Lord our God has commanded you to obey?”"
Deuteronomy,6,21,"If they do ask you, tell them, “We were Pharaoh’s slaves in Egypt. But the Lord used his mighty hand to bring us out of Egypt."
Deuteronomy,6,22,With our own eyes we saw the Lord send amazing signs. They were great and terrible. He sent them on Egypt and Pharaoh and everyone in his house.
Deuteronomy,6,23,But the Lord brought us out of Egypt. He planned to bring us into the land of Canaan and give it to us. It’s the land he promised to our people of long ago.
Deuteronomy,6,24,"The Lord our God commanded us to obey all his rules. He commanded us to honor him. If we do, we will always succeed and be kept alive. That’s what is happening today."
Deuteronomy,6,25,"We must make sure we obey the whole law in the sight of the Lord our God. That’s what he has commanded us to do. If we obey his law, we’ll be doing what he requires of us.”"
Deuteronomy,7,1,"The Lord your God will bring you into the land. You are going to enter it and take it as your own. He’ll drive out many nations to make room for you. He’ll drive out the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites. Those seven nations are larger and stronger than you are."
Deuteronomy,7,2,The Lord your God will hand them over to you. You will win the battle over them. You must completely destroy them. Don’t make a peace treaty with them. Don’t show them any mercy.
Deuteronomy,7,3,Don’t marry any of their people. Don’t give your daughters to their sons. And don’t take their daughters for your sons.
Deuteronomy,7,4,"If you do, those people will turn your children away from serving the Lord . Then your children will serve other gods. The Lord will be very angry with you. He will quickly destroy you."
Deuteronomy,7,5,So here is what you must do to those people. Break down their altars. Smash their sacred stones. Cut down the poles they use to worship the female god named Asherah. Burn the statues of their gods in the fire.
Deuteronomy,7,6,You are a holy nation. The Lord your God has set you apart for himself. He has chosen you to be his special treasure. He chose you out of all the nations on the face of the earth to be his people.
Deuteronomy,7,7,"The Lord chose you because he loved you very much. He didn’t choose you because you had more people than other nations. In fact, you had the smallest number of all."
Deuteronomy,7,8,"The Lord chose you because he loved you. He wanted to keep the promise he had made to your people of long ago. That’s why he used his mighty hand to bring you out of Egypt. He bought you back from the land where you were slaves. He set you free from the power of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt."
Deuteronomy,7,9,So I want you to realize that the Lord your God is God. He is the faithful God. He keeps his covenant for all time to come. He keeps it with those who love him and obey his commandments. He shows them his love.
Deuteronomy,7,10,But he will pay back those who hate him. He’ll destroy them. He’ll quickly pay back those who hate him.
Deuteronomy,7,11,"So be careful to obey the commands, rules and laws I’m giving you today."
Deuteronomy,7,12,Pay attention to the laws of the Lord your God. Be careful to obey them. Then he will keep his covenant of love with you. That’s what he promised to your people of long ago.
Deuteronomy,7,13,"The Lord will love you and bless you. He’ll cause there to be many of you. He’ll give you many children. He’ll bless the crops of your land. He’ll give you plenty of grain, olive oil and fresh wine. He’ll bless your herds with many calves. He’ll give your flocks many lambs. He’ll do all these things for you in the land of Canaan. It’s the land he promised your people of long ago that he would give you."
Deuteronomy,7,14,He will bless you more than any other nation. All your men and women will have children. All your livestock will have little ones.
Deuteronomy,7,15,The Lord will keep you from getting sick. He won’t send on you any of the horrible sicknesses you saw all around you in Egypt. But he’ll send them on everyone who hates you.
Deuteronomy,7,16,"You must destroy all the nations the Lord your God hands over to you. Don’t feel sorry for them. Don’t serve their gods. If you do, they will be a trap for you."
Deuteronomy,7,17,"You might say to yourselves, “These nations are stronger than we are. How can we drive them out?”"
Deuteronomy,7,18,But don’t be afraid of them. Be sure to remember what the Lord your God did to Pharaoh and all the Egyptians.
Deuteronomy,7,19,With your own eyes you saw what the Lord did to them. You saw the signs and amazing things he did. He reached out his mighty hand and powerful arm. The Lord your God used all those things to bring you out. You are now afraid of the nations that are in the land the Lord promised you. But the Lord your God will do to them the same things he did to Egypt.
Deuteronomy,7,20,The Lord your God will also send hornets among those nations. Some of the people left alive will hide from you. But even they will die.
Deuteronomy,7,21,So don’t be terrified by them. The Lord your God is with you. He is a great and wonderful God.
Deuteronomy,7,22,"The Lord your God will drive out those nations to make room for you. But he will do it little by little. You won’t be allowed to get rid of them all at once. If you did, wild animals would multiply all around you."
Deuteronomy,7,23,But the Lord your God will hand those nations over to you. He will throw them into a panic until they are destroyed.
Deuteronomy,7,24,He will hand their kings over to you. You will wipe out their names from the earth. No one will be able to stand up against you. You will destroy them.
Deuteronomy,7,25,"Burn the statues of their gods in the fire. Don’t wish for the silver and gold on those statues. Don’t take it for yourselves. If you do, it will be a trap for you. The Lord your God hates it."
Deuteronomy,7,26,"Don’t bring anything he hates into your house. If you do, you will be completely destroyed along with it. So hate it with all your heart. It is set apart to be destroyed."
Deuteronomy,8,1,"Make sure you obey every command I’m giving you today. Then you will live, and there will be many of you. You will enter the land and take it as your own. It’s the land the Lord promised to your people of long ago."
Deuteronomy,8,2,Remember how the Lord your God led you all the way. He guided you in the desert for these 40 years. He wanted to take your pride away. He wanted to test you to know what was in your hearts. He wanted to see whether you would obey his commands.
Deuteronomy,8,3,He took your pride away. He let you go hungry. Then he gave you manna to eat. You and your parents had never even known anything about manna before. He tested you to teach you that man doesn’t live only on bread. He also lives on every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord.
Deuteronomy,8,4,Your clothes didn’t wear out during these 40 years. Your feet didn’t swell.
Deuteronomy,8,5,"Here is what I want you to know in your hearts. The Lord your God guides you, just as parents guide their children."
Deuteronomy,8,6,Obey the commands of the Lord your God. Live as he wants you to live. Have respect for him.
Deuteronomy,8,7,"The Lord your God is bringing you into a good land. It has brooks, streams and deep springs of water. Those springs flow in its valleys and hills."
Deuteronomy,8,8,"It has wheat, barley, vines, fig trees, pomegranates, olive oil and honey."
Deuteronomy,8,9,There is plenty of food in that land. You will have everything you need. Its rocks have iron in them. And you can dig copper out of its hills.
Deuteronomy,8,10,"When you have eaten and are satisfied, praise the Lord your God. Praise him for the good land he has given you."
Deuteronomy,8,11,"Make sure you don’t forget the Lord your God. Don’t fail to obey his commands, laws and rules. I’m giving them to you today."
Deuteronomy,8,12,But suppose you don’t obey his commands. And suppose you have plenty to eat. You build fine houses and live in them.
Deuteronomy,8,13,The number of your herds and flocks increases. You also get more and more silver and gold. And everything you have multiplies.
Deuteronomy,8,14,Then your hearts will become proud. And you will forget the Lord your God. The Lord brought you out of Egypt. That’s the land where you were slaves.
Deuteronomy,8,15,He led you through that huge and terrible desert. It was a dry land. It didn’t have any water. It had poisonous snakes and scorpions. The Lord gave you water out of solid rock.
Deuteronomy,8,16,He gave you manna to eat in the desert. Your people had never even known anything about manna before. The Lord took your pride away. He tested you. He did it so that things would go well with you in the end.
Deuteronomy,8,17,"You might say to yourself, “My power and my strong hands have made me rich.”"
Deuteronomy,8,18,But remember the Lord your God. He gives you the ability to produce wealth. That shows he stands by the terms of the covenant he made with you. He promised it to your people of long ago. And he’s still faithful to his covenant today.
Deuteronomy,8,19,"Don’t forget the Lord your God. Don’t serve other gods. Don’t worship them and bow down to them. I am a witness against you today that if you do, you will certainly be destroyed."
Deuteronomy,8,20,You will be destroyed just like the nations the Lord your God is destroying to make room for you. That’s what will happen if you don’t obey him.
Deuteronomy,9,1,"Israel, listen to me. You are now about to go across the Jordan River. You will take over the land of the nations that live there. Those nations are greater and stronger than you are. Their large cities have walls that reach up to the sky."
Deuteronomy,9,2,"The people who live there are Anakites. They are strong and tall. You know all about them. You have heard people say, “Who can stand up against the Anakites?”"
Deuteronomy,9,3,"But today you can be sure the Lord your God will go over there ahead of you. He is like a fire that will burn them up. He’ll destroy them. He’ll bring them under your control. You will drive them out. You will put an end to them quickly, just as the Lord has promised you."
Deuteronomy,9,4,"The Lord your God will drive them out to make room for you. When he does, don’t say to yourself, “The Lord has done it because I am godly. That’s why he brought me here to take over this land.” That isn’t true. The Lord is going to drive out those nations to make room for you because they are very evil."
Deuteronomy,9,5,"You are not going in to take over their land because you have done what is right or honest. It’s because those nations are so evil. That’s why the Lord your God will drive them out to make room for you. He will do what he said he would do. He made a promise to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob."
Deuteronomy,9,6,"The Lord your God is giving you this good land to take as your own. But you must understand that it isn’t because you are a godly nation. In fact, you are stubborn."
Deuteronomy,9,7,Here is something you must remember. Never forget it. You made the Lord your God angry in the desert. You refused to obey him from the day you left Egypt until you arrived here.
Deuteronomy,9,8,At Mount Horeb you made the Lord angry enough to destroy you.
Deuteronomy,9,9,I went up the mountain. I went there to receive the tablets of the covenant law. They were made out of stone. It was the covenant the Lord had made with you. I stayed on the mountain for 40 days and 40 nights. I didn’t eat any food or drink any water.
Deuteronomy,9,10,The Lord gave me two stone tablets. The words on them were written by the finger of God. All the commandments the Lord gave you were written on the tablets. He announced them to you out of the fire on the mountain. He wrote them on the day you gathered together there.
Deuteronomy,9,11,The 40 days and 40 nights came to an end. Then the Lord gave me the two stone tablets. They were the tablets of the covenant law.
Deuteronomy,9,12,"The Lord told me, “Go down from here right away. The people you brought out of Egypt have become very sinful. They have quickly turned away from what I commanded them. They have made a statue of a god for themselves.”"
Deuteronomy,9,13,"The Lord also said to me, “I have seen these people. They are so stubborn!"
Deuteronomy,9,14,Do not try to stop me. I am going to destroy them. I will wipe them out from the earth. Then I will make you into a great nation. Your people will be stronger than they were. There will be more of you than there were of them.”
Deuteronomy,9,15,So I turned and went down the mountain. It was blazing with fire. I was carrying the two tablets of the covenant law.
Deuteronomy,9,16,"When I looked, I saw that you had sinned against the Lord your God. You had made for yourselves a metal statue of a god. It looked like a calf. You had quickly turned away from the path the Lord had commanded you to follow."
Deuteronomy,9,17,So I threw the two tablets out of my hands. You watched them break into pieces.
Deuteronomy,9,18,Then once again I fell down flat in front of the Lord with my face toward the ground. I lay there for 40 days and 40 nights. I didn’t eat any food or drink any water. You had committed a terrible sin. You had done an evil thing in the Lord ’s sight. You had made him angry.
Deuteronomy,9,19,I was afraid of the Lord ’s great anger. He was so angry with you he wanted to destroy you. But the Lord listened to me again.
Deuteronomy,9,20,And he was so angry with Aaron he wanted to destroy him too. But at that time I prayed for Aaron.
Deuteronomy,9,21,I also got that sinful calf you had made. I burned it in the fire. I crushed it and ground it into fine powder. Then I threw the powder into a stream that was flowing down the mountain.
Deuteronomy,9,22,"You also made the Lord angry at Taberah, Massah and Kibroth Hattaavah."
Deuteronomy,9,23,"The Lord sent you out from Kadesh Barnea. He said, “Go up and take over the land I have given you.” But you refused to do what the Lord your God had commanded you to do. You didn’t trust him or obey him."
Deuteronomy,9,24,You have been refusing to obey the Lord as long as I’ve known you.
Deuteronomy,9,25,I lay down in front of the Lord with my face toward the ground for 40 days and 40 nights. I did it because the Lord had said he would destroy you.
Deuteronomy,9,26,"I prayed to him. “ Lord and King,” I said, “don’t destroy your people. They belong to you. You set them free by your great power. You used your mighty hand to bring them out of Egypt."
Deuteronomy,9,27,"Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Forgive the Israelites for being so stubborn. Don’t judge them for the evil and sinful things they’ve done."
Deuteronomy,9,28,"If you do, the Egyptians will say, ‘The Lord wasn’t able to take them into the land he had promised to give them. He hated them. So he brought them out of Egypt to put them to death in the desert.’"
Deuteronomy,9,29,But they are your people. They belong to you. You used your great power to bring them out of Egypt. You reached out your mighty arm and saved them.”
Deuteronomy,10,1,"At that time the Lord spoke to me. He said, “Carve out two stone tablets, just like the first ones. Then come up to me on the mountain. Also make a wooden ark."
Deuteronomy,10,2,"I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke. Then you must put the tablets in the ark.”"
Deuteronomy,10,3,So I made the ark out of acacia wood. I carved out two stone tablets that were just like the first ones. I went up the mountain. I carried the two tablets in my hands.
Deuteronomy,10,4,The Lord wrote on the tablets what he had written before. It was the Ten Commandments. He had announced them to you out of the fire on the mountain. It was on the day you had gathered together there. So the Lord gave the tablets to me.
Deuteronomy,10,5,"Then I came back down the mountain. I put the tablets in the ark I had made, just as the Lord had commanded me. And that’s where they are now."
Deuteronomy,10,6,Remember how the Israelites traveled from the wells of Bene Jaakan to Moserah. That’s where Aaron died. And his body was buried there. His son Eleazar became the next priest after him.
Deuteronomy,10,7,From Moserah the people traveled to Gudgodah. Then they went on to Jotbathah. That land has streams of water.
Deuteronomy,10,8,At that time the Lord set the tribe of Levi apart. He appointed them to carry the ark of the covenant of the Lord . He wanted them to serve him. He told them to bless the people in his name. And they still do it today.
Deuteronomy,10,9,That’s why the Levites don’t have any part of the land the Lord gave the other tribes in Israel. They don’t have any share among them. The Lord himself is their share. That’s what the Lord your God told them.
Deuteronomy,10,10,"I had stayed on the mountain for 40 days and 40 nights, just as I did the first time. The Lord listened to me that time also. He didn’t want to destroy you."
Deuteronomy,10,11,"“Go,” the Lord said to me. “Lead the people on their way. Then they can enter the land and take it over. I have given my word. I promised I would give the land to their fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.”"
Deuteronomy,10,12,"And now, Israel, what is the Lord your God asking you to do? Honor him. Live exactly as he wants you to live. Love him. Serve him with all your heart and with all your soul."
Deuteronomy,10,13,Obey the Lord ’s commands and rules. I’m giving them to you today for your own good.
Deuteronomy,10,14,The heavens belong to the Lord your God. Even the highest heavens belong to him. He owns the earth and everything in it.
Deuteronomy,10,15,But the Lord loved your people of long ago very much. You are their children. And he chose you above all the other nations. His love and his promise remain with you to this very day.
Deuteronomy,10,16,So don’t be stubborn anymore. Obey the Lord.
Deuteronomy,10,17,The Lord your God is the greatest God of all. He is the greatest Lord of all. He is the great God. He is mighty and wonderful. He treats everyone the same. He doesn’t accept any money from those who want special favors.
Deuteronomy,10,18,He stands up for widows and for children whose fathers have died. He loves outsiders living among you. He gives them food and clothes.
Deuteronomy,10,19,So you also must love outsiders. Remember that you yourselves were outsiders in Egypt.
Deuteronomy,10,20,"Honor the Lord your God. Serve him. Remain true to him. When you make promises, do so in his name."
Deuteronomy,10,21,He is the one you should praise. He’s your God. With your own eyes you saw the great and amazing things he did for you.
Deuteronomy,10,22,"Long ago, your people went down into Egypt. The total number of them was 70. And now the Lord your God has made you as many as the stars in the sky."
Deuteronomy,11,1,"Love the Lord your God. Do what he requires. Always obey his rules, laws and commands."
Deuteronomy,11,2,Remember today that your children weren’t the ones the Lord your God guided and corrected. They didn’t see his majesty. They weren’t in Egypt when he reached out his mighty hand and powerful arm.
Deuteronomy,11,3,"They didn’t see the signs and the other things he did in Egypt. They didn’t see what he did to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and to his whole country."
Deuteronomy,11,4,They weren’t there when the Lord destroyed the army of Egypt and its horses and chariots. He swept the waters of the Red Sea over the Egyptians while they were chasing you. He wiped them out forever.
Deuteronomy,11,5,Your children didn’t see what he did for you in the desert before you arrived here.
Deuteronomy,11,6,"They didn’t see what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab. Eliab was from the tribe of Reuben. The earth opened its mouth right in the middle of the Israelite camp. It swallowed up Dathan and Abiram. It swallowed them up together with their families, tents and every living thing that belonged to them."
Deuteronomy,11,7,But with your own eyes you saw all the great things the Lord has done.
Deuteronomy,11,8,So obey all the commands I’m giving you today. Then you will be strong enough to go in and take over the land. You will go across the Jordan River and take the land as your own.
Deuteronomy,11,9,"You will live there for a long time. It’s the land the Lord promised to give to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and their children after them. He gave his word when he made that promise. The land has plenty of milk and honey."
Deuteronomy,11,10,"You will enter it and take it over. It isn’t like the land of Egypt. That’s where you came from. You planted your seeds there. You had to water them, just as you have to water a vegetable garden."
Deuteronomy,11,11,But you will soon go across the Jordan River. The land you are going to take over has mountains and valleys in it. It drinks rain from heaven.
Deuteronomy,11,12,It’s a land the Lord your God takes care of. His eyes always look on it with favor. He watches over it from the beginning of the year to its end.
Deuteronomy,11,13,So be faithful. Obey the commands the Lord your God is giving you today. Love him. Serve him with all your heart and with all your soul.
Deuteronomy,11,14,Then the Lord will send rain on your land at the right time. He’ll send rain in the fall and in the spring. You will be able to gather your grain. You will also be able to make olive oil and fresh wine.
Deuteronomy,11,15,He’ll provide grass in the fields for your cattle. You will have plenty to eat.
Deuteronomy,11,16,But be careful. Don’t let anyone tempt you to do something wrong. Don’t turn away and worship other gods. Don’t bow down to them.
Deuteronomy,11,17,"If you do, the Lord will be very angry with you. He’ll close up the sky. It won’t rain. The ground won’t produce its crops. Soon you will die. You won’t live to enjoy the good land the Lord is giving you."
Deuteronomy,11,18,So keep my words in your hearts and minds. Write them down and tie them on your hands as a reminder. Also tie them on your foreheads.
Deuteronomy,11,19,Teach them to your children. Talk about them when you are at home. Talk about them when you walk along the road. Speak about them when you go to bed. And speak about them when you get up.
Deuteronomy,11,20,Write them on the doorframes of your houses. Also write them on your gates.
Deuteronomy,11,21,"Then you and your children will live for a long time in the land. The Lord promised to give the land to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Your family line will continue as long as the heavens remain above the earth."
Deuteronomy,11,22,So be careful. Obey all the commands I’m giving you to follow. Love the Lord your God. Live exactly as he wants you to live. Remain true to him.
Deuteronomy,11,23,Then the Lord will drive out all the nations to make room for you. They are larger and stronger than you are. But you will take their land.
Deuteronomy,11,24,Every place you walk on will belong to you. Your territory will go all the way from the desert to Lebanon. It will go from the Euphrates River to the Mediterranean Sea.
Deuteronomy,11,25,"No one will be able to stand up against you. The Lord your God will throw the whole land into a panic because of you. He’ll do it everywhere you go, just as he promised you."
Deuteronomy,11,26,Listen to me. I’m setting a blessing and a curse in front of you today.
Deuteronomy,11,27,I’m giving you the commands of the Lord your God today. You will be blessed if you obey them.
Deuteronomy,11,28,But you will be cursed if you don’t obey them. So don’t turn away from the path I’m now commanding you to take. Don’t turn away by worshiping other gods you didn’t know before.
Deuteronomy,11,29,"The Lord your God will bring you into the land to take it over. When he does, you must announce the blessings from Mount Gerizim. You must announce the curses from Mount Ebal."
Deuteronomy,11,30,"As you know, those mountains are across the Jordan River. They are on the west side of the Jordan toward the setting sun. They are near the large trees of Moreh. The mountains are in the territory of the Canaanites, who live in the Arabah Valley near Gilgal."
Deuteronomy,11,31,You are about to go across the Jordan River. You will enter the land and take it over. The Lord your God is giving it to you. You will take it over and live there.
Deuteronomy,11,32,"When you do, make sure you obey all the rules and laws I’m giving you today."
Deuteronomy,12,1,Here are the rules and laws you must obey. Be careful to obey them in the land the Lord has given you to take as your own. He’s the God of your people who lived long ago. Obey these rules and laws as long as you live in the land.
Deuteronomy,12,2,"You will soon drive the nations out of it. Completely destroy all the places where they worship their gods. Destroy them on the high mountains, on the hills and under every green tree."
Deuteronomy,12,3,Break down their altars. Smash their sacred stones. Burn up the poles they use to worship the female god named Asherah. Cut down the statues of their gods. Wipe out the names of their gods from those places.
Deuteronomy,12,4,You must not worship the Lord your God the way those nations worship their gods.
Deuteronomy,12,5,"Instead, go to the special place he will choose from among all your tribes. He will put his Name there. That’s where you must go."
Deuteronomy,12,6,Take your burnt offerings and sacrifices to that place. Bring your special gifts and a tenth of everything you produce. Take with you what you have promised to give. Bring any other offerings you choose to give. And bring the male animals among your livestock that were born first to their mothers.
Deuteronomy,12,7,You and your families will eat at the place the Lord your God will choose. He will be with you there. You will find joy in everything you have done. That’s because he has blessed you.
Deuteronomy,12,8,You must not do as we’re doing here today. All of us are doing only what we think is right.
Deuteronomy,12,9,That’s because you haven’t yet reached the place the Lord is giving you. Your God will give you peace and rest there.
Deuteronomy,12,10,But first you will go across the Jordan River. You will settle in the land he’s giving you. It will belong to you as your share. He will give you peace and rest from all your enemies around you. You will live in safety.
Deuteronomy,12,11,The Lord your God will choose a special place. He will put his Name there. That’s where you must bring everything I command you to bring. That includes your burnt offerings and sacrifices. It includes your special gifts and a tenth of everything you produce. It also includes all the things of value that you promised to give to the Lord.
Deuteronomy,12,12,Be filled with joy there in the sight of the Lord your God. Your children should also be joyful. So should your male and female servants. And so should the Levites from your towns. The Levites won’t receive any part of the land as their share.
Deuteronomy,12,13,Be careful not to sacrifice your burnt offerings anywhere you want to.
Deuteronomy,12,14,Offer them only at the place the Lord will choose in one of your tribes. There you must obey everything I command you.
Deuteronomy,12,15,But you can kill your animals in any of your towns. You can eat as much of the meat as you want to. You can eat it as if it were antelope or deer meat. That is part of the blessing the Lord your God is giving you. Those who are “clean” and those who are not can eat it.
Deuteronomy,12,16,But you must not eat meat that still has blood in it. Pour the blood out on the ground like water.
Deuteronomy,12,17,"Here are the things you must not eat in your own towns. You must not eat the tenth part of your grain, olive oil and fresh wine. It belongs to the Lord . You must not eat the male animals among your livestock that were born first to their mothers. Don’t eat anything you have promised to give. Don’t eat any offerings you have chosen to give. And you must not eat any of your special gifts."
Deuteronomy,12,18,"Instead, you must eat all those things in the sight of the Lord your God. Do it at the place he will choose. You, your children, your male and female servants and the Levites from your towns can eat them. Be filled with joy in the sight of the Lord your God. Be joyful in everything you do."
Deuteronomy,12,19,Don’t forget to take care of the Levites as long as you live in your land.
Deuteronomy,12,20,"The Lord your God will increase your territory, just as he has promised you. When he does, you might get hungry for meat. You might say, “I’d really like some meat.” Then you can eat as much of it as you want to."
Deuteronomy,12,21,The Lord your God will choose a special place. He will put his Name there. But suppose that place is too far away from you. Then you can kill animals from the herds and flocks the Lord has given you. Do it just as I have commanded you. In your own towns you can eat as much of the meat as you want to.
Deuteronomy,12,22,Eat it as you would eat antelope or deer meat. Those who are “clean” and those who are not can eat it.
Deuteronomy,12,23,But be sure you don’t eat meat that still has blood in it. The blood is the animal’s life. So you must not eat the life along with the meat.
Deuteronomy,12,24,You must not eat the blood. Pour it out on the ground like water.
Deuteronomy,12,25,Don’t eat it. Then things will go well with you and your children after you. You will be doing what is right in the eyes of the Lord.
Deuteronomy,12,26,But go to the place the Lord will choose. Take with you the things you have set apart for him. Bring what you have promised to give him.
Deuteronomy,12,27,Sacrifice your burnt offerings on the altar of the Lord your God. Offer the meat and the blood there. The blood of your sacrifices must be poured out beside his altar. But you can eat the meat.
Deuteronomy,12,28,Make sure you obey all the rules I’m giving you. Then things will always go well with you and your children after you. That’s because you will be doing what is good and right in the eyes of the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy,12,29,"You are about to attack the land and take it over as your own. When you do, the Lord your God will destroy the nations who live there. He will do it to make room for you. You will drive them out. You will settle in their land."
Deuteronomy,12,30,"They will be destroyed to make room for you. But when they are destroyed, be careful. Don’t be trapped. Don’t ask questions about their gods. Don’t say, “How do these nations serve their gods? We’ll do it in the same way.”"
Deuteronomy,12,31,"You must not worship the Lord your God the way they worship their gods. When they worship, they do all kinds of evil things the Lord hates. They even burn up their children in the fire as sacrifices to their gods."
Deuteronomy,12,32,Be sure you do everything I am commanding you to do. Do not add anything to my commands. And do not take anything away from them.
Deuteronomy,13,1,Suppose a prophet appears among you. Or someone comes who uses dreams to tell what’s going to happen. He tells you that a sign or something amazing is going to take place.
Deuteronomy,13,2,"The sign or amazing thing he has spoken about might really take place. And then the prophet might say, “Let’s serve other gods. Let’s worship them.” But you haven’t known anything about those gods before."
Deuteronomy,13,3,So you must not listen to what that prophet or dreamer has said. The Lord your God is testing you. He wants to know whether you love him with all your heart and with all your soul.
Deuteronomy,13,4,You must worship him. You must honor him. Keep his commands. Obey him. Serve him. Remain true to him.
Deuteronomy,13,5,That prophet or dreamer must be put to death. He told you not to obey the Lord your God. The Lord brought you out of Egypt. He set you free from the land where you were slaves. He commanded you to live the way he wants you to. But that prophet or dreamer has tried to get you to be unfaithful to the Lord . Get rid of that evil person.
Deuteronomy,13,6,"Suppose your very own brother or sister secretly tempts you to do something wrong. Or your child or the wife you love tempts you. Or your closest friend does it. Suppose one of them says, “Let’s go and worship other gods.” But you and your people of long ago hadn’t known anything about those gods before."
Deuteronomy,13,7,"They are the gods of the nations around you. Those nations might be near or far away. In fact, they might reach from one end of the land to the other."
Deuteronomy,13,8,Don’t give in to those who are tempting you. Don’t listen to them. Don’t feel sorry for them. Don’t spare them or save them.
Deuteronomy,13,9,You must certainly put them to death. You must be the first to throw stones at them. Then all the people must do the same thing.
Deuteronomy,13,10,Put them to death by throwing stones at them. They tried to turn you away from the Lord your God. He brought you out of Egypt. That’s the land where you were slaves.
Deuteronomy,13,11,"After you kill those who tempted you, all the Israelites will hear about it. And they will be too scared to do an evil thing like that again."
Deuteronomy,13,12,The Lord your God is giving you towns to live in. But suppose you hear something bad about one of those towns.
Deuteronomy,13,13,"You hear that people who cause trouble have appeared among you. They’ve tried to get the people of their town to do something wrong. They’ve said, “Let’s go and worship other gods.” But you haven’t known anything about those gods before."
Deuteronomy,13,14,"So you must ask people some questions. You must check out the matter carefully. If it’s true, an evil thing has really happened among you. It’s something the Lord hates."
Deuteronomy,13,15,Then you must certainly kill with your swords everyone who lives in that town. You must destroy it completely. You must wipe out its people and livestock.
Deuteronomy,13,16,You must gather all the goods of that town into the middle of the main street. You must burn the town completely. You must burn up everything in it. It’s a whole burnt offering to the Lord your God. The town must remain a pile of stones forever. It must never be built again.
Deuteronomy,13,17,Don’t keep anything that should be destroyed. Then the Lord will turn away from his great anger. He will show you mercy. He’ll have deep concern for you. He’ll cause there to be many of you. That’s what he promised your people of long ago. He gave his word when he made the promise.
Deuteronomy,13,18,The Lord your God will do those things if you obey him. I’m giving you his commands today. And you must obey all of them. You must do what is right in his eyes.
Deuteronomy,14,1,You are the children of the Lord your God. Don’t cut yourselves to honor the dead. Don’t shave the front of your heads to honor the dead.
Deuteronomy,14,2,You are a holy nation. The Lord your God has set you apart for himself. He has chosen you to be his special treasure. He chose you out of all the nations on the face of the earth.
Deuteronomy,14,3,Don’t eat anything the Lord hates.
Deuteronomy,14,4,"Here are the only animals you can eat. You can eat oxen, sheep, goats,"
Deuteronomy,14,5,"deer, gazelles, roe deer, wild goats, ibexes, antelope and mountain sheep."
Deuteronomy,14,6,You can eat any animal that has a divided hoof. But it must also chew the cud.
Deuteronomy,14,7,"Some animals only chew the cud. Others only have a divided hoof. The camel, rabbit and rock badger chew the cud, but they don’t have a divided hoof. So you can’t eat them. They are not “clean” for you."
Deuteronomy,14,8,"Pigs aren’t “clean” for you either. They have a divided hoof, but they don’t chew the cud. So don’t eat their meat. And don’t touch their dead bodies."
Deuteronomy,14,9,Many creatures live in water. You can eat all the ones that have fins and scales.
Deuteronomy,14,10,But don’t eat anything that doesn’t have fins and scales. It isn’t “clean” for you.
Deuteronomy,14,11,You can eat any “clean” bird.
Deuteronomy,14,12,"But there are many birds you can’t eat. They include eagles, vultures, and black vultures."
Deuteronomy,14,13,"They include red kites, black kites and all kinds of falcons."
Deuteronomy,14,14,They include all kinds of ravens.
Deuteronomy,14,15,"They include horned owls, screech owls, gulls and all kinds of hawks."
Deuteronomy,14,16,"They include little owls, great owls, white owls"
Deuteronomy,14,17,and desert owls. They include ospreys and cormorants.
Deuteronomy,14,18,They include storks and all kinds of herons. They also include hoopoes and bats.
Deuteronomy,14,19,All flying insects are “unclean” for you. So don’t eat them.
Deuteronomy,14,20,But you can eat any creature that has wings and is “clean.”
Deuteronomy,14,21,"If you find something that’s already dead, don’t eat it. You can give it to an outsider living in any of your towns. They may eat it. Or you can sell it to someone from another country. But you are a holy nation. The Lord your God has set you apart for himself. Don’t cook a young goat in its mother’s milk."
Deuteronomy,14,22,Be sure to set apart a tenth of everything your fields produce each year.
Deuteronomy,14,23,"Here are the things you should eat in the sight of the Lord your God. You should eat a tenth part of your grain, olive oil and fresh wine. You should also eat the male animals among your livestock that were born first to their mothers. Eat all these things at the special place the Lord your God will choose. He will put his Name there. You will learn to honor him always."
Deuteronomy,14,24,But suppose the place the Lord will choose for his Name is too far away from you. And suppose your God has blessed you. And your tenth part is too heavy for you to carry.
Deuteronomy,14,25,Then sell it for silver. Take the silver with you. Go to the place the Lord your God will choose.
Deuteronomy,14,26,"Use the silver to buy anything you like. It can be cattle or sheep. It can be any kind of wine. In fact, it can be anything else you wish. Then you and your family can eat there in the sight of the Lord your God. You can be filled with joy."
Deuteronomy,14,27,Don’t forget to take care of the Levites who will live in your towns. They won’t receive any part of the land as their share.
Deuteronomy,14,28,"At the end of every three years, bring a tenth of everything you produce that year. Store it in your towns."
Deuteronomy,14,29,Then the Levites can come and eat. That’s because they won’t receive any part of the land as their share. The outsiders and widows who live in your towns can come. So can the children whose fathers have died. Everyone can have plenty to eat. Then the Lord your God will bless you in everything you do.
Deuteronomy,15,1,At the end of every seven years you must forgive people what they owe you.
Deuteronomy,15,2,Have you made a loan to one of your own people? Then forgive what is owed to you. You can’t require that person to pay you back. The Lord ’s time to forgive what is owed has been announced.
Deuteronomy,15,3,You can require someone from another nation to pay you back. But you must forgive what any of your own people owes you.
Deuteronomy,15,4,There shouldn’t be any poor people among you. The Lord will greatly bless you in the land he is giving you. You will take it over as your own.
Deuteronomy,15,5,The Lord your God will bless you if you obey him completely. Be careful to follow all the commands I’m giving you today.
Deuteronomy,15,6,"The Lord your God will bless you, just as he has promised. You will lend money to many nations. But you won’t have to borrow from any of them. You will rule over many nations. But none of them will rule over you."
Deuteronomy,15,7,Suppose someone is poor among you. And suppose they live in one of the towns in the land the Lord your God is giving you. Then don’t be mean to them. They are poor. So don’t hold back money from them.
Deuteronomy,15,8,"Instead, open your hands and lend them what they need. Do it freely."
Deuteronomy,15,9,"Be careful not to have an evil thought in your mind. Don’t say to yourself, “The seventh year will soon be here. It’s the year for forgiving people what they owe.” If you think like that, you might treat the needy people among you badly. You might not give them anything. Then they might make their appeal to the Lord against you. And he will find you guilty of sin."
Deuteronomy,15,10,So give freely to needy people. Let your heart be tender toward them. Then the Lord your God will bless you in all your work. He will bless you in everything you do.
Deuteronomy,15,11,There will always be poor people in the land. So I’m commanding you to give freely to those who are poor and needy in your land. Open your hands to them.
Deuteronomy,15,12,"Suppose any Hebrew men or women sell themselves to you. If they do, they will serve you for six years. Then in the seventh year you must let them go free."
Deuteronomy,15,13,"But when you set them free, don’t send them away without anything to show for all their work."
Deuteronomy,15,14,Freely give them some animals from your flock. Also give them some of your grain and wine. The Lord your God has blessed you richly. Give to them as he has given to you.
Deuteronomy,15,15,Remember that you were slaves in Egypt. The Lord your God set you free. That’s why I’m giving you this command today.
Deuteronomy,15,16,"But suppose your servant says to you, “I don’t want to leave you.” He loves you and your family. And you are taking good care of him."
Deuteronomy,15,17,Then take him to the door of your house. Poke a hole through his earlobe into the doorpost. And he will become your servant for life. Do the same with your female servant.
Deuteronomy,15,18,"Don’t think you are being cheated when you set your servants free. After all, they have served you for six years. The service of each of them has been worth twice as much as the service of a hired worker. And the Lord your God will bless you in everything you do."
Deuteronomy,15,19,Set apart every male animal among your livestock that was born first to its mother. Set it apart to the Lord your God. Don’t put a firstborn cow to work. Don’t clip the wool from a firstborn sheep.
Deuteronomy,15,20,Each year you and your family must eat them. Do it in front of the Lord your God at the place he will choose.
Deuteronomy,15,21,Suppose an animal has something wrong with it. It might not be able to see or walk. Or it might have a bad flaw. Then you must not sacrifice it to the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy,15,22,You must eat it in your own towns. Those who are “clean” and those who are “unclean” can eat it. Eat it as if it were antelope or deer meat.
Deuteronomy,15,23,But you must not eat meat that still has blood in it. Pour the blood out on the ground like water.
Deuteronomy,16,1,Celebrate the Passover Feast of the Lord your God in the month of Aviv. In that month he brought you out of Egypt at night.
Deuteronomy,16,2,Sacrifice an animal from your flock or herd. It is the Passover sacrifice to honor the Lord your God. Sacrifice it at the special place the Lord will choose. He will put his Name there.
Deuteronomy,16,3,"Don’t eat the animal along with bread made with yeast. Instead, for seven days eat bread made without yeast. It’s the bread that reminds you of how much you suffered. Remember that you left Egypt in a hurry. Remember it all the days of your life. Don’t forget the day you left Egypt."
Deuteronomy,16,4,Don’t keep any yeast anywhere in your land for seven days. You will sacrifice the Passover animal on the evening of the first day. Do not let any of its meat be left over until the next morning.
Deuteronomy,16,5,You must not sacrifice the Passover animal in just any town the Lord your God is giving you.
Deuteronomy,16,6,Sacrifice it only in the special place he will choose for his Name. Sacrifice it there in the evening when the sun goes down. Do it on the same day every year. Be sure it’s the day you left Egypt.
Deuteronomy,16,7,Cook the animal and eat it. Do it at the place the Lord your God will choose. Then in the morning return to your tents.
Deuteronomy,16,8,For six days eat bread made without yeast. On the seventh day come together for a service to honor the Lord your God. Don’t do any work on that day.
Deuteronomy,16,9,Count off seven weeks from the time you begin to cut your grain in the field.
Deuteronomy,16,10,"Then celebrate the Feast of Weeks to honor the Lord your God. Give to the Lord anything you choose to give as an offering. Give, just as the Lord has given to you."
Deuteronomy,16,11,"Be filled with joy in the sight of the Lord your God. Be joyful at the special place he will choose for his Name. You, your children, and your male and female servants should be joyful. So should the Levites living in your towns. So should the outsiders and widows living among you. And so should the children whose fathers have died."
Deuteronomy,16,12,Remember that you were slaves in Egypt. Be careful to obey the rules I’m giving you.
Deuteronomy,16,13,Gather the grain from your threshing floors. Take the fresh wine from your winepresses. Then celebrate the Feast of Booths for seven days.
Deuteronomy,16,14,"Be filled with joy at your feast. You, your children, and your male and female servants should be joyful. So should the Levites, the outsiders, and the widows living in your towns. And so should the children whose fathers have died."
Deuteronomy,16,15,For seven days celebrate the feast to honor the Lord your God. Do it at the place he will choose. The Lord will bless you when you gather all your crops. He’ll bless you in everything you do. And you will be full of joy.
Deuteronomy,16,16,"All your men must appear in front of the Lord your God at the holy tent. They must go to the place he will choose. They must do it three times a year. They must go there to celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks and the Feast of Booths. None of your men should appear in front of the Lord without bringing something with him."
Deuteronomy,16,17,"Each of you must bring a gift. Give to the Lord your God, just as he has given to you."
Deuteronomy,16,18,Appoint judges and officials for each of your tribes. Do it in every town the Lord your God is giving you. They must judge the people fairly.
Deuteronomy,16,19,Do what is right. Treat everyone the same. Don’t take money from people who want special favors. It makes those who are wise close their eyes to the truth. It twists the words of those who have done nothing wrong.
Deuteronomy,16,20,Do only what is right. Then you will live. You will take over the land the Lord your God is giving you.
Deuteronomy,16,21,Don’t set up a wooden pole used to worship the female god named Asherah. Don’t set it up beside the altar you build to worship the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy,16,22,Don’t set up a sacred stone to honor another god. The Lord your God hates Asherah poles and sacred stones.
Deuteronomy,17,1,Suppose an ox or sheep has anything at all wrong with it. Then don’t sacrifice it to the Lord your God. He hates it.
Deuteronomy,17,2,Someone living among you might do what is evil in the sight of the Lord your God. It might happen in one of the towns the Lord is giving you. That person is breaking the Lord ’s covenant.
Deuteronomy,17,3,The person might have worshiped or bowed down to other gods. That person might have bowed down to the sun or moon or stars in the sky. I have commanded you not to do these things.
Deuteronomy,17,4,"When you hear that people have done something like that, check the matter out carefully. If it’s true, an evil thing has been done in Israel. The Lord hates that."
Deuteronomy,17,5,So take the person who has done that evil thing to your city gate. Put that person to death by throwing stones at them.
Deuteronomy,17,6,Two or three witnesses are required to put someone to death. No one can be put to death because of what only one witness says. Two or three witnesses are required.
Deuteronomy,17,7,The witnesses must throw the first stones. Then the rest of the people must also throw stones. Get rid of that evil person.
Deuteronomy,17,8,"People will bring their cases to your courts. But some cases will be too hard for you to judge. They might be about murders, attacks or other crimes. Then take those hard cases to the place the Lord your God will choose."
Deuteronomy,17,9,"Go to a priest, who is a Levite. And go to the judge who is in office at that time. Ask them for their decision. They will give it to you."
Deuteronomy,17,10,They’ll hand down their decisions at the place the Lord will choose. You must do what they decide. Be careful to do everything they tell you to do.
Deuteronomy,17,11,Act according to whatever they teach you. Accept the decisions they give you. Don’t turn away from what they tell you. Don’t turn to the right or the left.
Deuteronomy,17,12,"Someone might show that they don’t respect the judge. Or they will show that they don’t respect the priest. The priest will serve the Lord your God at the place God will choose. If anyone doesn’t show respect for these people, that person must be put to death. Remove that evil person from Israel."
Deuteronomy,17,13,All the Israelites will hear about it. And they will be afraid to disrespect a judge or priest again.
Deuteronomy,17,14,"You will enter the land the Lord your God is giving you. You will take it as your own. You will make your homes in it. When you do, you will say, “Let’s appoint a king over us, just like all the nations around us.”"
Deuteronomy,17,15,"When that happens, make sure you appoint over yourselves a king the Lord your God chooses. He must be from among your own people. Don’t appoint over yourselves someone from another country. Don’t choose anyone who isn’t from one of the tribes of Israel."
Deuteronomy,17,16,"The king must not get large numbers of horses for himself. He must not make the people return to Egypt to get more horses. The Lord has told you, “You must not go back there again.”"
Deuteronomy,17,17,"The king must not have many wives. If he does, they will lead him astray. He must not store up large amounts of silver and gold."
Deuteronomy,17,18,"When he sits on the throne of his kingdom, he must make for himself a copy of the law. He must write on a scroll the law that I am teaching you. He must copy it from the scroll of a priest, who is a Levite."
Deuteronomy,17,19,The king must keep the scroll close to him at all times. He must read it all the days of his life. Then he can learn to have respect for the Lord his God. He can carefully obey all the words of this law and these rules.
Deuteronomy,17,20,He won’t think of himself as being better than his people are. He won’t turn away from the law. He won’t turn to the right or the left. Then he and his sons after him will rule over his kingdom in Israel for a long time.
Deuteronomy,18,1,"The priests, who are Levites, won’t receive any part of the land of Israel. That also applies to the whole tribe of Levi. They will eat the food offerings presented to the Lord . That will be their share."
Deuteronomy,18,2,"They won’t have any part of the land the Lord gave the other tribes in Israel. The Lord himself is their share, just as he promised them."
Deuteronomy,18,3,"Anyone who sacrifices a bull or a sheep owes a share of it to the priests. Their share is the shoulder, the inside parts and the meat from the head."
Deuteronomy,18,4,"You must give the priests the first share of the harvest of your grain, olive oil and fresh wine. You must also give them the first wool you clip from your sheep."
Deuteronomy,18,5,The Lord your God has chosen the Levites and their sons after them to serve him in his name always. He hasn’t chosen priests from any of your other tribes.
Deuteronomy,18,6,Sometimes a Levite will move from the town in Israel where he’s living. And he will come to the place the Lord will choose. He’ll do it because he really wants to.
Deuteronomy,18,7,Then he can serve in the name of the Lord his God. He’ll be like all the other Levites who serve the Lord there.
Deuteronomy,18,8,He must have an equal share of the good things they have. That applies even if he has already received money by selling things his family owned.
Deuteronomy,18,9,"You will enter the land the Lord your God is giving you. When you do, don’t copy the practices of the nations there. The Lord hates those practices."
Deuteronomy,18,10,Here are things you must not do. Don’t sacrifice your children in the fire to other gods. Don’t practice any kind of evil magic at all. Don’t use magic to try to explain the meaning of warnings in the sky or of any other signs. Don’t take part in worshiping evil powers.
Deuteronomy,18,11,Don’t put a spell on anyone. Don’t get messages from those who have died. Don’t talk to the spirits of the dead. Don’t get advice from the dead.
Deuteronomy,18,12,The Lord your God hates it when anyone does these things. The nations in the land he’s giving you do these things he hates. So he will drive out those nations to make room for you.
Deuteronomy,18,13,You must be without blame in the sight of the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy,18,14,You will take over the nations that are in the land the Lord is giving you. They listen to those who practice all kinds of evil magic. But you belong to the Lord your God. He says you must not do these things.
Deuteronomy,18,15,The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me. He will be one of your own people. You must listen to him.
Deuteronomy,18,16,"At Mount Horeb you asked the Lord your God for a prophet. You asked him on the day you gathered together. You said, “We don’t want to hear the voice of the Lord our God. We don’t want to see this great fire anymore. If we do, we’ll die.”"
Deuteronomy,18,17,"The Lord said to me, “What they are saying is good."
Deuteronomy,18,18,I will raise up for them a prophet like you. He will be one of their own people. I will put my words in his mouth. He will tell them everything I command him to say.
Deuteronomy,18,19,The prophet will speak in my name. But someone might not listen to what I say through the prophet. I will hold that person responsible for not listening.
Deuteronomy,18,20,But suppose a prophet dares to speak in my name something I have not commanded. Or he speaks in the name of other gods. Then that prophet must be put to death.”
Deuteronomy,18,21,"You will say to yourselves, “How can we know when a message hasn’t been spoken by the Lord ?”"
Deuteronomy,18,22,Sometimes a prophet will announce something in the name of the Lord . And it won’t take place or come true. Then that’s a message the Lord hasn’t told him to speak. That prophet has dared to speak on his own authority. So don’t be afraid of what he says.
Deuteronomy,19,1,The Lord your God will destroy the nations whose land he is giving you. You will drive them out. And you will make your homes in their towns and their houses.
Deuteronomy,19,2,"When you do, set apart for yourselves three cities in the land. It’s the land the Lord your God is giving you to take as your own."
Deuteronomy,19,3,Figure out the distances and then separate the land into three parts. Then anyone who kills another person can run to one of these cities for safety. They are in the land the Lord your God is giving you as your own.
Deuteronomy,19,4,Here is the rule about a person who kills someone. That person can run to one of those cities for safety. The rule applies to anyone who kills a neighbor they didn’t hate and didn’t mean to kill.
Deuteronomy,19,5,"For example, suppose a man goes into a forest with his neighbor to cut wood. When he swings his ax to chop down a tree, the head of the ax flies off. And it hits his neighbor and kills him. Then that man can run to one of those cities and save his life."
Deuteronomy,19,6,"If he doesn’t go to one of those cities, the dead man’s nearest male relative might become very angry. He might chase the man. If the city is too far away, he might catch him and kill him. But the man running to the city isn’t worthy of death, because he didn’t hate his neighbor."
Deuteronomy,19,7,That’s why I command you to set apart for yourselves three cities.
Deuteronomy,19,8,The Lord your God will increase the size of your territory. He promised your people of long ago that he would do it. He will give you the whole land he promised them.
Deuteronomy,19,9,"But he’ll do it only if you are careful to obey all the laws I’m commanding you today. I command you to love the Lord your God. You must always live as he wants you to live. Suppose you are careful to obey, and the Lord your God gives you more land. Then you must set apart three more cities."
Deuteronomy,19,10,Do it to protect those not guilty of murder. Then you won’t spill their blood in your land. It’s the land the Lord your God is giving you as your own.
Deuteronomy,19,11,But suppose a man hates his neighbor. So he hides and waits for him. Then he attacks him and kills him. And he runs to one of those cities for safety.
Deuteronomy,19,12,"If he does, the elders of his own town must send for him. He must be brought back from the city. He must be handed over to the dead man’s nearest male relative. Then the relative will kill him."
Deuteronomy,19,13,Don’t feel sorry for him. He has killed someone who hadn’t done anything wrong. Crimes like that must be punished in Israel. Then things will go well with you.
Deuteronomy,19,14,Don’t move your neighbor’s boundary stone. It was set up by people who lived there before you. It marks the border of a field in the land you will receive as your own. The Lord your God is giving you that land. You will take it over.
Deuteronomy,19,15,Suppose someone is charged with committing a crime of any kind. Then one witness won’t be enough to prove that person is guilty. Every matter must be proved by the words of two or three witnesses.
Deuteronomy,19,16,Suppose a witness who tells lies goes to court and brings charges against someone. The witness says someone committed a crime.
Deuteronomy,19,17,Then the two people in the case must stand in front of the Lord . They must stand in front of the priests and the judges who are in office at that time.
Deuteronomy,19,18,The judges must check out the matter carefully. And suppose the witness is proved to be lying. Then he has said something false in court against another Israelite.
Deuteronomy,19,19,So do to the lying witness what he tried to do to the other person. Get rid of that evil witness.
Deuteronomy,19,20,The rest of the people will hear about it. And they will be afraid. They won’t allow such an evil thing to be done among them again.
Deuteronomy,19,21,Don’t feel sorry for that evil person. A life must be taken for a life. An eye must be put out for an eye. A tooth must be knocked out for a tooth. A hand must be cut off for a hand and a foot for a foot.
Deuteronomy,20,1,"When you go to war against your enemies, you might see that they have horses and chariots. They might even have an army stronger than yours. But don’t be afraid of them. The Lord your God will be with you. After all, he brought you up out of Egypt."
Deuteronomy,20,2,"Just before you go into battle, the priest will come forward. He’ll speak to the army."
Deuteronomy,20,3,"He’ll say, “Men of Israel, listen to me. Today you are going into battle against your enemies. Don’t be scared. Don’t be afraid. Don’t panic or be terrified by them."
Deuteronomy,20,4,The Lord your God is going with you. He’ll fight for you. He’ll help you win the battle over your enemies.”
Deuteronomy,20,5,"The officers will speak to the army. They will say, “Has anyone built a new house and not started to live in it? Let him go home. If he doesn’t, he might die in battle. Then someone else will live in his house."
Deuteronomy,20,6,"Has anyone planted a vineyard and not started to enjoy it? Let him go home. If he doesn’t, he might die in battle. Then someone else will enjoy his vineyard."
Deuteronomy,20,7,"Has anyone promised to be married to a woman but hasn’t done it yet? Let him go home. If he doesn’t, he might die in battle. Then someone else will marry her.”"
Deuteronomy,20,8,"The officers will continue, “Is anyone afraid or scared? Let him go home. Then the other soldiers won’t lose hope too.”"
Deuteronomy,20,9,"The officers will finish speaking to the army. When they do, they’ll appoint commanders over it."
Deuteronomy,20,10,"Suppose you march up to attack a city. Before you attack it, offer to make peace with its people."
Deuteronomy,20,11,Suppose they accept your offer and open their gates. Then force all the people in the city to be your slaves. They will have to work for you.
Deuteronomy,20,12,But suppose they refuse your offer of peace and prepare for battle. Then surround that city. Get ready to attack it.
Deuteronomy,20,13,"The Lord your God will hand it over to you. When he does, kill all the men with your swords."
Deuteronomy,20,14,But you can take the women and children for yourselves. You can also take the livestock and everything else in the city. What you have captured from your enemies you can use for yourselves. The Lord your God has given it to you.
Deuteronomy,20,15,That’s how you must treat all the cities far away from you. Those cities don’t belong to the nations that are nearby.
Deuteronomy,20,16,But what about the cities the Lord your God is giving you as your own? Kill everything that breathes in those cities.
Deuteronomy,20,17,"Completely destroy them. Wipe out the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites. That’s what the Lord your God commanded you to do."
Deuteronomy,20,18,"If you don’t destroy them, they’ll teach you to do all the things the Lord hates. He hates the way they worship their gods. If you do those things, you will sin against the Lord your God."
Deuteronomy,20,19,Suppose you surround a city and get ready to attack it. And suppose you fight against it for a long time in order to capture it. Then don’t chop down its trees and destroy them. You can eat their fruit. So don’t cut them down. Are the trees people? So why should you attack them?
Deuteronomy,20,20,But you can cut down trees that you know aren’t fruit trees. You can build war machines out of their wood. You can use them until you capture the city you are fighting against.
Deuteronomy,21,1,Suppose you find someone who has been killed. The body is lying in a field in the land the Lord your God is giving you as your own. But no one knows who the killer was.
Deuteronomy,21,2,Then your elders and judges will go out to the field. They will measure the distance from the body to the nearby towns.
Deuteronomy,21,3,The elders from the town that is nearest to the body will get a young cow. It must never have been used for work. It must never have pulled a load.
Deuteronomy,21,4,The elders must lead it down into a valley. The valley must not have been farmed. There must be a stream flowing through it. There in the valley the elders must break the cow’s neck.
Deuteronomy,21,5,"The priests, who are sons of Levi, will step forward. The Lord your God has chosen them to serve him. He wants them to bless the people in his name. He wants them to decide all cases that have to do with people arguing and attacking others."
Deuteronomy,21,6,Then all the elders from the town that is nearest to the body will wash their hands. They will wash them over the young cow whose neck they broke in the valley.
Deuteronomy,21,7,"They’ll say to the Lord , “We didn’t kill that person. We didn’t see it happen."
Deuteronomy,21,8,"Accept this payment for the sin of your people Israel. Lord , you have set your people free. Don’t hold them guilty for spilling the blood of someone who hasn’t done anything wrong.” That will pay for the death of that person."
Deuteronomy,21,9,So you will get rid of the guilt of killing someone who didn’t do anything wrong. That’s because you have done what is right in the Lord ’s eyes.
Deuteronomy,21,10,Suppose you go to war against your enemies. And the Lord your God hands them over to you and you take them as prisoners.
Deuteronomy,21,11,"Then you notice a beautiful woman among them. If you like her, you may marry her."
Deuteronomy,21,12,Bring her home. Have her shave her head and cut her nails.
Deuteronomy,21,13,Have her throw away the clothes she was wearing when she was captured. Let her live in your house and mourn the loss of her parents for a full month. Then you can go to her and be her husband. And she will be your wife.
Deuteronomy,21,14,But suppose you aren’t pleased with her. Then let her go where she wants to. You must not sell her. You must not treat her as a slave. You have already brought shame on her.
Deuteronomy,21,15,Suppose a man has two wives. He loves one but not the other. And both of them have sons by him. But the oldest son is the son of the wife the man doesn’t love.
Deuteronomy,21,16,"Someday he’ll leave his property to his sons. When he does, he must not give the rights of the oldest son to the son of the wife he loves. He must give those rights to his oldest son. He must do it even though his oldest son is the son of the wife he doesn’t love."
Deuteronomy,21,17,"He must recognize the full rights of the oldest son. He must do it, even though that son is the son of the wife he doesn’t love. He must give that son a double share of everything he has. That son is the first sign of his father’s strength. So the rights of the oldest son belong to him."
Deuteronomy,21,18,Suppose someone has a very stubborn son. He doesn’t obey his father and mother. And he won’t listen to them when they try to correct him.
Deuteronomy,21,19,Then his parents will take hold of him and bring him to the elders at the gate of his town.
Deuteronomy,21,20,"They will say to the elders, “This son of ours is very stubborn. He won’t obey us. He eats too much. He’s always getting drunk.”"
Deuteronomy,21,21,Then all the people in his town will put him to death by throwing stones at him. Get rid of that evil person. All the Israelites will hear about it. And they will be afraid to disobey their parents.
Deuteronomy,21,22,Suppose someone is put to death for a crime worthy of death. And a pole is stuck through their body and set up where people can see it.
Deuteronomy,21,23,Then you must not leave the body on the pole all night. Make sure you bury it that same day. Everyone who is hung on a pole is under God’s curse. You must not make the land “unclean.” The Lord your God is giving it to you as your own.
Deuteronomy,22,1,"Suppose you see your neighbor’s ox or sheep wandering away. Then don’t act as if you didn’t see it. Instead, make sure you take it back to its owner."
Deuteronomy,22,2,Its owner might not live near you. Or you might not know who owns it. So take the animal home with you. Keep it until the owner comes looking for it. Then give it back to them.
Deuteronomy,22,3,"Do the same thing if you find their donkey, coat or anything they have lost. Don’t act as if you didn’t see it."
Deuteronomy,22,4,Suppose you see your neighbor’s donkey or ox that has fallen down on the road. Then don’t act as if you didn’t see it. Help the owner get it up on its feet again.
Deuteronomy,22,5,A woman must not wear men’s clothes. And a man must not wear women’s clothes. The Lord your God hates it when anyone does this.
Deuteronomy,22,6,Suppose you happen to find a bird’s nest beside the road. It might be in a tree or on the ground. And suppose the mother bird is sitting on her little birds or on the eggs. Then don’t take the mother along with the little ones.
Deuteronomy,22,7,You can take the little ones. But make sure you let the mother go. Then things will go well with you. You will live for a long time.
Deuteronomy,22,8,"If you build a new house, put a low wall around the edge of your roof. Then you won’t be responsible if someone falls off your roof and dies."
Deuteronomy,22,9,"Don’t plant two kinds of seeds in your vineyard. If you do, the crops you grow there will be impure. Your grapes will also be impure."
Deuteronomy,22,10,Don’t let an ox and a donkey pull the same plow together.
Deuteronomy,22,11,Don’t wear clothes made out of wool and linen woven together.
Deuteronomy,22,12,Make tassels on the four corners of the coat you wear.
Deuteronomy,22,13,Suppose a man marries a woman and sleeps with her. But then he doesn’t like her.
Deuteronomy,22,14,"So he tells lies about her and says she’s a bad woman. He says, “I married this woman. But when I slept with her, I discovered she wasn’t a virgin.”"
Deuteronomy,22,15,Then the young woman’s parents must bring proof that she was a virgin. They must give the proof to the elders at the gate of the town.
Deuteronomy,22,16,"Her father will speak to the elders. He’ll say, “I gave my daughter to this man to be his wife. But he doesn’t like her."
Deuteronomy,22,17,"So now he has told lies about her. He has said, ‘I discovered that your daughter wasn’t a virgin.’ But here’s the proof that my daughter was a virgin.” Then her parents will show the elders of the town the cloth that has her blood on it."
Deuteronomy,22,18,The elders will punish the man.
Deuteronomy,22,19,They’ll make him weigh out two and a half pounds of silver. They’ll give it to the young woman’s father. That’s because the man has said an Israelite virgin is a bad woman. She will continue to be his wife. He must not divorce her as long as he lives.
Deuteronomy,22,20,But suppose the charge is true. And there isn’t any proof that the young woman was a virgin.
Deuteronomy,22,21,Then she must be brought to the door of her father’s house. There the people of her town will put her to death by throwing stones at her. She has done a very terrible thing in Israel. She has slept with a man before she was married. Get rid of that evil person.
Deuteronomy,22,22,Suppose a man is seen sleeping with another man’s wife. Then the man and the woman must both die. Get rid of those evil people.
Deuteronomy,22,23,Suppose a man happens to see a virgin in a town. And she has promised to marry another man. But the man who happens to see her sleeps with her.
Deuteronomy,22,24,Then you must take both of them to the gate of that town. You must put them to death by throwing stones at them. You must kill the young woman because she was in a town and didn’t scream for help. And you must kill the man because he slept with another man’s wife. Get rid of those evil people.
Deuteronomy,22,25,But suppose a man happens to see a young woman out in the country. And she has promised to marry another man. But the man who happens to see her rapes her. Then only the man who has done that will die.
Deuteronomy,22,26,Don’t do anything to the woman. She hasn’t committed a sin worthy of death. That case is like the case of someone who attacks and murders a neighbor.
Deuteronomy,22,27,The man found the young woman out in the country. And she screamed for help. But there wasn’t anyone around who could save her.
Deuteronomy,22,28,Suppose a man happens to see a virgin who hasn’t promised to marry another man. And the man who happens to see her rapes her. But someone discovers them.
Deuteronomy,22,29,"Then the man must weigh out 20 ounces of silver. He must give it to her father. The man must marry the young woman, because he raped her. And he can never divorce her as long as he lives."
Deuteronomy,22,30,A man must not marry his stepmother. He must not bring shame on his father by sleeping with her.
Deuteronomy,23,1,No man whose sex organs have been crushed or cut can join in worship with the Lord ’s people.
Deuteronomy,23,2,No one born to an unmarried woman can join in worship with the Lord ’s people. That also applies to the person’s children for all time to come.
Deuteronomy,23,3,The people of Ammon and Moab can’t join in worship with the Lord ’s people. That also applies to their children after them for all time to come.
Deuteronomy,23,4,The Ammonites and Moabites didn’t come to meet you with food and water on your way out of Egypt. They even hired Balaam from Pethor in Aram Naharaim to put a curse on you. Balaam was the son of Beor.
Deuteronomy,23,5,"The Lord your God wouldn’t listen to Balaam. Instead, he turned the curse into a blessing for you. He did it because he loves you."
Deuteronomy,23,6,So don’t make a peace treaty with the Ammonites and Moabites as long as you live.
Deuteronomy,23,7,"Don’t hate the people of Edom. They are your relatives. Don’t hate the people of Egypt. After all, you lived as outsiders in their country."
Deuteronomy,23,8,The great-grandchildren of the Edomites and Egyptians can join in worship with the Lord ’s people.
Deuteronomy,23,9,There will be times when you are at war with your enemies. And your soldiers will be in camp. Then keep away from anything that isn’t pure and “clean.”
Deuteronomy,23,10,Suppose semen flows from the body of one of your soldiers during the night. Then that will make him “unclean.” He must go outside the camp and stay there.
Deuteronomy,23,11,"But as evening approaches, he must wash himself. When the sun goes down, he can return to the camp."
Deuteronomy,23,12,Choose a place outside the camp where you can go to the toilet.
Deuteronomy,23,13,"Keep a shovel among your tools. When you go to the toilet, dig a hole. Then cover up your waste."
Deuteronomy,23,14,The Lord your God walks around in your camp. He’s there to keep you safe. He’s also there to hand your enemies over to you. So your camp must be holy. Then he won’t see anything among you that is shameful. He won’t turn away from you.
Deuteronomy,23,15,"If a slave comes to you for safety, don’t hand them over to their master."
Deuteronomy,23,16,Let them live among you anywhere they want to. Let them live in any town they choose. Don’t treat them badly.
Deuteronomy,23,17,A man or woman in Israel must not become a temple prostitute.
Deuteronomy,23,18,The Lord your God hates the money that men and women get for being prostitutes. So don’t take that money into the house of the Lord to pay what you promised to give.
Deuteronomy,23,19,"Don’t charge your own people any interest. Don’t charge them when they borrow money, food or anything else."
Deuteronomy,23,20,You can charge interest to people from another country. But don’t charge your own people. Then the Lord your God will bless you in everything you do. He will bless you in the land you are entering to take as your own.
Deuteronomy,23,21,Don’t put off giving to the Lord your God everything you promise him. He will certainly require it from you. And you will be guilty of committing a sin.
Deuteronomy,23,22,"But if you don’t make a promise, you won’t be guilty."
Deuteronomy,23,23,Make sure you do what you promised to do. With your own mouth you made the promise to the Lord your God. No one forced you to do it.
Deuteronomy,23,24,"When you enter your neighbor’s vineyard, you can eat all the grapes you want. But don’t put any of them in your basket."
Deuteronomy,23,25,"When you enter your neighbor’s field, you can pick heads of grain. But don’t cut down their standing grain."
Deuteronomy,24,1,Suppose a man marries a woman. But later he decides he doesn’t like her. He finds something shameful about her. So he gives her a letter of divorce and sends her away from his house.
Deuteronomy,24,2,Then after she leaves his house she becomes another man’s wife.
Deuteronomy,24,3,But her second husband doesn’t like her either. So he gives her a letter of divorce and sends her away from his house. Or perhaps he dies.
Deuteronomy,24,4,"Then her first husband isn’t allowed to marry her again. The Lord would hate that. When her first husband divorced her, she became “unclean.” Don’t bring sin on the land the Lord your God is giving you as your own."
Deuteronomy,24,5,Suppose a man has just married his wife. Then don’t send him into battle. Don’t give him any other duty either. He’s free to stay home for one year. He needs time to make his new wife happy.
Deuteronomy,24,6,Someone might borrow money from you and give you two millstones to keep until you are paid back. Don’t keep them. Don’t even keep the upper one. That person needs both millstones to make a living.
Deuteronomy,24,7,Suppose someone is caught kidnapping another Israelite. And they sell or treat that person as a slave. Then the kidnapper must die. Get rid of that evil person.
Deuteronomy,24,8,"What about skin diseases? Be very careful to do exactly what the priests, who are Levites, tell you to do. You must be careful to obey the commands I’ve given them."
Deuteronomy,24,9,Remember what the Lord your God did to Miriam on your way out of Egypt.
Deuteronomy,24,10,Suppose your neighbor borrows something from you. And he offers you something to keep until you get paid back. Then don’t go into their house to get it.
Deuteronomy,24,11,Stay outside. Let the neighbor bring it out to you.
Deuteronomy,24,12,The neighbor might be poor. You might be given their coat to keep until you get paid back. Don’t go to sleep while you still have it.
Deuteronomy,24,13,Return it before the sun goes down. They need it to sleep in and will thank you for returning it. The Lord your God will see it and know that you have done the right thing.
Deuteronomy,24,14,Don’t take advantage of any hired worker who is poor and needy. That applies to your own people. It also applies to outsiders living in one of your towns.
Deuteronomy,24,15,"Give them their pay every day. They are poor and are counting on it. If you don’t pay them, they might cry out to the Lord against you. Then you will be guilty of committing a sin."
Deuteronomy,24,16,Parents must not be put to death because of what their children do. And children must not be put to death because of what their parents do. People must die because of their own sins.
Deuteronomy,24,17,Do what is right and fair for outsiders and for children whose fathers have died. Suppose a widow borrows something from you. And she offers to give you her coat until she pays you back. Don’t take it.
Deuteronomy,24,18,Remember that you were slaves in Egypt. Remember that the Lord your God set you free from there. That’s why I’m commanding you to do those things.
Deuteronomy,24,19,"When you are gathering crops in your field, you might leave some grain behind by mistake. Don’t go back to get it. Leave it behind for outsiders and widows. Leave it for children whose fathers have died. Then the Lord your God will bless you in everything you do."
Deuteronomy,24,20,"When you knock olives off your trees, don’t go back over the branches a second time. Leave what remains for outsiders and widows. Leave it for children whose fathers have died."
Deuteronomy,24,21,"When you pick grapes in your vineyard, don’t go back over the vines a second time. Leave what remains for outsiders and widows. Leave it for children whose fathers have died."
Deuteronomy,24,22,Remember that you were slaves in Egypt. That’s why I’m commanding you to do these things.
Deuteronomy,25,1,Suppose two people don’t agree about something. Then they must take their case to court. The judges will decide the case. They will let the one who isn’t guilty go free. And they will punish the one who is guilty.
Deuteronomy,25,2,The guilty one might have done something that’s worthy of a beating. Then the judge will make them lie down and be beaten with a whip right there in court. The number of strokes should fit the crime.
Deuteronomy,25,3,"But the judge must not give the guilty person more than 40 strokes. If more than that are used, you will have disrespected your Israelite neighbor."
Deuteronomy,25,4,Don’t stop an ox from eating while you use it to separate grain from straw.
Deuteronomy,25,5,Suppose two brothers are living near each other. And one of them dies without having a son. Then his widow must not marry anyone outside the family. Her husband’s brother should marry her. That’s what a brother-in-law is supposed to do.
Deuteronomy,25,6,Her first baby boy will be named after her first husband. Then the dead man’s name will continue in Israel.
Deuteronomy,25,7,"But suppose the man doesn’t want to marry his brother’s wife. Then she will go to the elders at the gate of the town. She will say, “My husband’s brother refuses to keep his brother’s name alive in Israel. He won’t do for me what a brother-in-law is supposed to do.”"
Deuteronomy,25,8,"Then the elders in his town will send for him. They will talk to him. But he still might say, “I don’t want to marry her.”"
Deuteronomy,25,9,"Then his brother’s widow will go up to him in front of the elders. She’ll pull one of his sandals off his foot. She’ll spit in his face. And she’ll say, “That’s what we do to a man who won’t build up his brother’s family line.”"
Deuteronomy,25,10,That man’s family line will be known in Israel as The Family of the Man Whose Sandal Was Pulled Off.
Deuteronomy,25,11,Suppose two men are fighting. And the wife of one of them comes to save her husband from his attacker. So she reaches out and grabs hold of his attacker’s private parts.
Deuteronomy,25,12,Then you must cut off her hand. Don’t feel sorry for her.
Deuteronomy,25,13,Don’t have two different scales. Don’t have scales that cause things to seem heavier or lighter than they really are.
Deuteronomy,25,14,And don’t have two different sets of measures. Don’t have measures that cause things to seem larger or smaller than they really are.
Deuteronomy,25,15,You must use weights and measures that are honest and exact. Then you will live a long time in the land the Lord your God is giving you.
Deuteronomy,25,16,He hates anyone who cheats.
Deuteronomy,25,17,Remember what the Amalekites did to you on your way out of Egypt.
Deuteronomy,25,18,You were tired and worn out. They met up with you on your journey. They attacked everyone who was lagging behind. They didn’t have any respect for God.
Deuteronomy,25,19,The Lord your God will give you peace and rest from all the enemies around you. He’ll do this in the land he’s giving you to take over as your very own. No one on earth will mention the Amalekites ever again because you will destroy them. Do not forget!
Deuteronomy,26,1,You will enter the land the Lord your God is giving you as your own. You will take it over. You will make your homes in the land.
Deuteronomy,26,2,"When you do, get some of the first share of everything your soil produces. Put it in a basket. It’s from the land the Lord your God is giving you. Take your gifts and go to the special place he will choose. He will put his Name there."
Deuteronomy,26,3,"Speak to the priest in office at that time. Tell him, “I announce today to the Lord your God that I have come to this land. It’s the land he promised to give us. He promised it to our people of long ago.”"
Deuteronomy,26,4,The priest will receive the basket from you. He’ll set it down in front of the altar of the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy,26,5,"Then you will speak while the Lord is listening. You will say, “My father Jacob was a wanderer from the land of Aram. He went down into Egypt with a few people. He lived there and became the father of a great nation. It had huge numbers of people."
Deuteronomy,26,6,But the people of Egypt treated us badly. They made us suffer. They made us work very hard.
Deuteronomy,26,7,Then we cried out to the Lord . He is the God of our people who lived long ago. He heard our voice. He saw how much we were suffering. The Egyptians were treating us badly. They were making us work very hard.
Deuteronomy,26,8,So the Lord used his mighty hand and powerful arm to bring us out of Egypt. He did great and terrifying things. He did signs and amazing things.
Deuteronomy,26,9,He brought us to this place. He gave us this land. It’s a land that has plenty of milk and honey.
Deuteronomy,26,10,"Now, Lord , I’m bringing you the first share of crops from the soil. After all, you have given them to me.” Place the basket in front of the Lord your God. Bow down to him."
Deuteronomy,26,11,Then you and the Levites and the outsiders among you will be full of joy. You will enjoy all the good things the Lord your God has given to you and your family.
Deuteronomy,26,12,"You will set apart a tenth of everything you produce in the third year. That’s the year for giving the tenth to people who have greater needs. You will give it to the Levites, outsiders and widows. You will also give it to children whose fathers have died. Then all of them will have plenty to eat in your towns."
Deuteronomy,26,13,"Speak to the Lord your God. Say to him, “I have taken your sacred share from my house. I have given it to the Levites, outsiders and widows. I have also given it to children whose fathers have died. I’ve done everything you commanded me to do. I haven’t stopped obeying your commands. I haven’t forgotten any of them."
Deuteronomy,26,14,"I haven’t eaten any part of your sacred share while I mourned over someone who had died. I haven’t taken any of it from my house while I was ‘unclean.’ And I haven’t offered any of it to the dead. Lord my God, I’ve obeyed you. I’ve done everything you commanded me to do."
Deuteronomy,26,15,Look down from the holy place where you live in heaven. Bless your people Israel. Bless the land you have given us. It’s the land you promised to give to our people of long ago. It’s a land that has plenty of milk and honey.”
Deuteronomy,26,16,This day the Lord your God commands you to obey all these rules and laws. Be careful to obey them with all your heart and with all your soul.

Deuteronomy,28,55,He won’t give to a single one of them any part of the dead bodies of his children that he’s eating. It will be all he has left to eat. That’s how much your enemies will make you suffer when they surround all your cities and attack them.
Deuteronomy,28,56,There may be a gentle and caring woman among you. She wouldn’t even touch the ground with her feet without first putting her sandals on. But she will not share anything with the husband she loves. She won’t share with her own children either.
Deuteronomy,28,57,She will eat what comes out of her body after she has a baby. Then she’ll even eat her baby. She won’t share it with anyone in her family. In her great hunger she’ll plan to eat it in secret. There won’t be anything else for her to eat because the city she lives in will be surrounded. That’s an example of how much your enemies will make you suffer when they are attacking your cities.

Deuteronomy,28,63,It pleased the Lord to give you success and to cause there to be many of you. But it will please him just as much to wipe you out and destroy you. You will be removed from the land you are entering to take as your own.
Deuteronomy,28,64,Then the Lord will scatter you among all the nations. He’ll spread you around from one end of the earth to the other. There you will worship statues of gods made out of wood and stone. You and your people of long ago hadn’t known anything about those gods.
Deuteronomy,28,65,Among those nations you won’t find any peace. There won’t be any place where you can make your home and rest your feet. The Lord will give you minds filled with worry. He’ll give you eyes worn out from looking for help. You won’t have any hope in your hearts.
Deuteronomy,28,66,Your lives will always be in danger. You will be filled with fear night and day. You will never be sure you are safe.
Deuteronomy,28,67,"In the morning you will say, “We wish it were evening!” In the evening you will say, “We wish it were morning!” Your hearts will be filled with fear. The things you see will terrify you."
Deuteronomy,28,68,The Lord will send you back to Egypt in ships. He’ll send you on a journey I said you should never have to make again. You will offer to sell yourselves to your enemies as slaves in Egypt. But no one will buy you.
Deuteronomy,29,1,Here are the terms of the covenant the Lord commanded Moses to make with the Israelites in Moab. The terms were added to the covenant he had made with them at Mount Horeb.
Deuteronomy,29,2,Moses sent for all the Israelites. Here is what he said to them. With your own eyes you have seen everything the Lord did in Egypt to Pharaoh. You have seen what he did to all Pharaoh’s officials and to his whole land.
Deuteronomy,29,3,With your own eyes you saw how the Lord really made them suffer. You saw the signs and amazing things he did.
Deuteronomy,29,4,But to this day the Lord hasn’t given you a mind that understands. He hasn’t given you eyes that see. He hasn’t given you ears that hear.
Deuteronomy,29,5,"Yet the Lord says, “I led you through the desert for 40 years. During that time your clothes didn’t wear out. The sandals on your feet didn’t wear out either."
Deuteronomy,29,6,You didn’t eat any bread. You didn’t drink any kind of wine. I did all these things because I wanted you to know that I am the Lord your God.”
Deuteronomy,29,7,"When you got here, Sihon and Og came out to fight against us. Sihon was the king of Heshbon. And Og was the king of Bashan. But we won the battle over them."
Deuteronomy,29,8,We took their land. We gave it to the tribes of Reuben and Gad and half of the tribe of Manasseh as their share.
Deuteronomy,29,9,Be careful to obey the terms of this covenant. Then you will have success in everything you do.
Deuteronomy,29,10,Today all of you are standing here in the sight of the Lord your God. Your leaders and chief men are here. Your elders and officials are here. So are all the other men of Israel.
Deuteronomy,29,11,Your children and wives are here with you too. So are the outsiders living in your camps. They chop your wood and carry your water.
Deuteronomy,29,12,All of you are standing here in order to enter into a covenant with the Lord your God. He is making the covenant with you today. He’s giving you his word.
Deuteronomy,29,13,"Today he wants to show you that you are his people and that he is your God. That’s what he promised to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob."
Deuteronomy,29,14,I’m making this covenant and the promise that goes along with it. I’m making this covenant with you.
Deuteronomy,29,15,You are standing here with us today in front of the Lord our God. And I’m also making this covenant with those who aren’t here today.
Deuteronomy,29,16,You yourselves know how we lived in Egypt. You also know how we passed through other countries on the way here.
Deuteronomy,29,17,"You saw the statues of their gods made out of wood, stone, silver and gold. The Lord hates those statues."
Deuteronomy,29,18,Make sure there isn’t a man or woman among your families or tribes who turns away from the Lord our God. No one must worship the gods of those nations. Make sure that kind of worship doesn’t spread like bitter poison through your whole community.
Deuteronomy,29,19,"Some people who worship those gods will hear the promise that seals the covenant I’m making. They think they can escape trouble by what they’re saying. They say, “We’ll be safe, even though we’re stubborn and go our own way.” But they will bring trouble on the whole land."
Deuteronomy,29,20,The Lord will never be willing to forgive those people. His great anger will blaze out against them. All the curses I’ve written down in this book will fall on them. And the Lord will erase any mention of them from the earth.
Deuteronomy,29,21,He will find those people in all the tribes of Israel and give them nothing but trouble. That will agree with all the curses of the covenant. They are written down in this Book of the Law.
Deuteronomy,29,22,Even your children’s children will see the troubles that have fallen on the land. They’ll see the sicknesses the Lord has brought on it. People who come from countries far away will also see those things.
Deuteronomy,29,23,"The whole land will be burned up. Nothing but salt and sulfur will be left. Nothing will be planted there. Nothing will grow there. In fact, nothing will even start to grow there. The land will be like Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboyim after they were destroyed. The Lord wiped out those cities because he was very angry."
Deuteronomy,29,24,"All the nations will ask, “Why has the Lord done this to the land? What could have made him so very angry?”"
Deuteronomy,29,25,"And they will hear the answer, “It’s because the people living there have broken the covenant of the Lord . He’s the God of their people of long ago. He made that covenant with them when he brought them out of Egypt."
Deuteronomy,29,26,They went off and worshiped other gods. They bowed down to them. They hadn’t known anything about those gods before. The Lord hadn’t given those gods to them.
Deuteronomy,29,27,So the Lord became very angry with this land. He brought on it all the curses written down in this book.
Deuteronomy,29,28,The Lord ’s anger blazed out against his people. So he pulled them up out of their land. He threw them into another land. And that’s where they are now.”
Deuteronomy,29,29,The Lord our God keeps certain things hidden. But he makes other things known to us and to our children forever. He does it so we can obey all the words of this law.
Deuteronomy,30,1,I have told you about all these blessings and curses. The Lord your God will bring them on you. Then you will think carefully about the blessings and curses. You will think about them everywhere the Lord your God scatters you among the nations.
Deuteronomy,30,2,You and your children will return to the Lord your God. You will obey him with all your heart and with all your soul. That will be according to everything I’m commanding you today.
Deuteronomy,30,3,"When all that happens, the Lord your God will bless you with great success again. He will be very kind to you. He’ll bring you back from all the nations where he scattered you."
Deuteronomy,30,4,Suppose you have been forced to go away to the farthest land on earth. The Lord your God will bring you back even from there.
Deuteronomy,30,5,He will bring you to the land that belonged to your people of long ago. You will take it over. He’ll make you better off than your people were. He’ll cause there to be more of you than there were of them.
Deuteronomy,30,6,The Lord your God will keep you from being stubborn. He’ll do the same thing for your children and their children. Then you will love him with all your heart and with all your soul. And you will live.
Deuteronomy,30,7,The Lord your God will put all these curses on your enemies. They hated you and hunted you down.
Deuteronomy,30,8,You will obey the Lord again. You will obey all his commands that I’m giving you today.
Deuteronomy,30,9,Then the Lord your God will give you great success in everything you do. You will have many children. Your livestock will have many little ones. Your crops will do very well. The Lord will take delight in you again. He’ll give you success. That’s what he did for your people of long ago.
Deuteronomy,30,10,But you must obey the Lord your God. You must keep his commands and rules. They are written in this Book of the Law. You must turn to the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul.
Deuteronomy,30,11,What I’m commanding you today is not too hard for you. It isn’t beyond your reach.
Deuteronomy,30,12,"It isn’t up in heaven. So you don’t have to ask, “Who will go up into heaven to get it? Who will announce it to us so we can obey it?”"
Deuteronomy,30,13,"And it isn’t beyond the ocean. So you don’t have to ask, “Who will go across the ocean to get it? Who will announce it to us so we can obey it?”"
Deuteronomy,30,14,"No, the message isn’t far away at all. In fact, it’s really near you. It’s in your mouth and in your heart so that you can obey it."
Deuteronomy,30,15,Today I’m giving you a choice. You can have life and success. Or you can have death and harm.
Deuteronomy,30,16,"I’m commanding you today to love the Lord your God. I’m commanding you to live exactly as he wants you to live. You must obey his commands, rules and laws. Then you will live. There will be many of you. The Lord your God will bless you in the land you are entering to take as your own."
Deuteronomy,30,17,"Don’t let your hearts turn away from the Lord . Instead, obey him. Don’t let yourselves be drawn away to other gods. And don’t bow down to them and worship them."
Deuteronomy,30,18,"If you do, I announce to you this day that you will certainly be destroyed. You are about to go across the Jordan River and take over the land. But you won’t live there very long."
Deuteronomy,30,19,I’m calling for the heavens and the earth to be witnesses against you this very day. I’m offering you the choice of life or death. You can choose either blessings or curses. But I want you to choose life. Then you and your children will live.
Deuteronomy,30,20,"And you will love the Lord your God. You will obey him. You will remain true to him. The Lord is your very life. He will give you many years in the land. He promised to give that land to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob."
Deuteronomy,31,1,Here are the words Moses spoke to all the Israelites.
Deuteronomy,31,2,"He said, “I am now 120 years old. I’m not able to lead you anymore. The Lord has said to me, ‘You will not go across the Jordan River.’"
Deuteronomy,31,3,"The Lord your God himself will go across ahead of you. He’ll destroy the nations there in order to make room for you. You will take over their land. Joshua will also go across ahead of you, just as the Lord said he would."
Deuteronomy,31,4,The Lord will do to those nations what he did to Sihon and Og. He destroyed those Amorite kings along with their land.
Deuteronomy,31,5,The Lord will hand those nations over to you. Then you must do to them everything I’ve commanded you to do.
Deuteronomy,31,6,Be strong and brave. Don’t be afraid of them. Don’t be terrified because of them. The Lord your God will go with you. He will never leave you. He’ll never desert you.”
Deuteronomy,31,7,"Then Moses sent for Joshua. Moses spoke to him in front of all the Israelites. He said, “Be strong and brave. You must go with these people. They are going into the land the Lord promised to give to their people of long ago. You must divide it up among them. They will each receive their share."
Deuteronomy,31,8,The Lord himself will go ahead of you. He will be with you. He will never leave you. He’ll never desert you. So don’t be afraid. Don’t lose hope.”
Deuteronomy,31,9,"Moses wrote down this law. He gave it to the priests, who are sons of Levi. They carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord . He also gave the law to all the elders of Israel."
Deuteronomy,31,10,"Then Moses commanded them, “You must read this law at the end of every seven years. Do it in the year when you forgive people what they owe. Read it during the Feast of Booths."
Deuteronomy,31,11,That’s when all the Israelites come to appear in front of the Lord your God at the holy tent. It will be at the place he will choose. You must read this law to them.
Deuteronomy,31,12,"Gather the people together. Gather the men, women and children. Also bring together the outsiders living in your towns. Then they can listen and learn to have respect for the Lord your God. And they’ll be careful to obey all the words of this law."
Deuteronomy,31,13,Their children must hear it read too. They don’t know this law yet. They too must learn to have respect for the Lord your God. They must honor him as long as you live in the land. You are about to go across the Jordan River and take that land as your very own.”
Deuteronomy,31,14,"The Lord said to Moses, “The day when you will die is near. Have Joshua go to the tent of meeting. Join him there. That is where I will appoint him as the new leader.” So Joshua and Moses went to the tent of meeting."
Deuteronomy,31,15,Then the Lord appeared at the tent in a pillar of cloud. It stood over the entrance to the tent.
Deuteronomy,31,16,"The Lord spoke to Moses. He said, “You are going to join the members of your family who have already died. The Israelites will not be faithful to me. They will soon join themselves to the false gods that are worshiped in the land they are entering. The people will desert me. They will break the covenant I made with them."
Deuteronomy,31,17,"In that day I will become angry with them. I will desert them. I will turn my face away from them. And they will be destroyed. Many horrible troubles and hard times will come on them. On that day they will say, ‘Trouble has come on us. Our God isn’t with us!’"
Deuteronomy,31,18,I will certainly turn away from them on that day. I will do it because they did a very evil thing when they turned to other gods.
Deuteronomy,31,19,“I want you to write down a song and teach it to the Israelites. Have them sing it. It will be my witness against them.
Deuteronomy,31,20,"I will bring them into a land that has plenty of milk and honey. I promised the land to their people of long ago. In that land they will eat until they have had enough. They will get fat. When they do, they will turn to other gods and worship them. They will turn their backs on me. They will break my covenant."
Deuteronomy,31,21,Many horrible troubles and hard times will come on them. Then the song I am giving you will be a witness against them. That is because the song will not be forgotten by their children and their children’s children. I know what they are likely to do. I know it even before I bring them into the land I promised them.”
Deuteronomy,31,22,So that day Moses wrote the song down. And Moses taught it to the Israelites.
Deuteronomy,31,23,"The Lord gave a command to Joshua, the son of Nun. He said, “Be strong and brave. You will bring the Israelites into the land I promised them. I myself will be with you.”"
Deuteronomy,31,24,Moses finished writing the words of this law in a book. He wrote them down from beginning to end.
Deuteronomy,31,25,"Then he gave a command to the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord . Moses said,"
Deuteronomy,31,26,“Take this Book of the Law. Place it beside the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God. It will remain there as a witness against you.
Deuteronomy,31,27,I know how you refuse to obey the Lord . I know how stubborn you are. You have refused to obey him while I’ve been living among you. So you will certainly refuse to obey him after I’m dead!
Deuteronomy,31,28,Gather together all the elders of your tribes and all your officials. Bring them to me. Then I can speak these words to them. I can call for the heavens and the earth to be witnesses against them.
Deuteronomy,31,29,"I know that after I’m dead you will certainly become very sinful. You will turn away from the path I’ve commanded you to take. In days to come, trouble will fall on you. That’s because you will do what is evil in the sight of the Lord . You will make him very angry because of the statues of gods your hands have made.”"
Deuteronomy,31,30,Moses spoke the words of this song from beginning to end. The whole community of Israel heard them. Here is what he said.
Deuteronomy,32,1,"Heavens, listen to me. Then I will speak. Earth, hear the words of my mouth."
Deuteronomy,32,2,Let my teaching fall like rain. Let my words come down like dew. Let them be like raindrops on new grass. Let them be like rain on tender plants.
Deuteronomy,32,3,I will make known the name of the Lord. Praise God! How great he is!
Deuteronomy,32,4,He is the Rock. His works are perfect. All his ways are right. He is faithful. He doesn’t do anything wrong. He is honest and fair.
Deuteronomy,32,5,"Israel, you have sinned against him very much. It’s too bad for you that you aren’t his children anymore. You have become a twisted and evil nation."
Deuteronomy,32,6,"Is that how you thank the Lord? You aren’t wise. You are foolish. Remember, he’s your Father. He’s your Creator. He made you. He formed you."
Deuteronomy,32,7,Remember the days of long ago. Think about what the Lord did through those many years. Ask your father. He will tell you. Ask your elders. They’ll explain it to you.
Deuteronomy,32,8,The Most High God gave the nations their lands. He divided up the human race. He set up borders for the nations. He did it based on the number of the angels in his heavenly court.
Deuteronomy,32,9,The Lord ’s people are his share. Jacob is the nation he has received.
Deuteronomy,32,10,The Lord found Israel in a desert. He found them in an empty and windy land. He took care of them and kept them safe. He guarded them as he would guard his own eyes.
Deuteronomy,32,11,He was like an eagle that stirs up its nest. It hovers over its little ones. It spreads out its wings to catch them. It carries them up in the air on its feathers.
Deuteronomy,32,12,The Lord was the only one who led Israel. No other god was with them.
Deuteronomy,32,13,The Lord made them ride on the highest places in the land. He fed them what grew in the fields. He gave them the sweetest honey. He fed them olive oil from a rocky hillside.
Deuteronomy,32,14,He gave them butter and milk from the herds and flocks. He fed them the fattest lambs and goats. He gave them the best of Bashan’s rams. He fed them the finest wheat. They drank the bubbling red juice of grapes.
Deuteronomy,32,15,"When Israel grew fat, they became stubborn. When they were filled with food, they became fat and heavy. They left the God who made them. They turned away from the Rock who saved them."
Deuteronomy,32,16,They made him jealous by serving false gods. They made him angry by worshiping statues of gods. He hated those gods.
Deuteronomy,32,17,"The people sacrificed to those false gods, not to God. They hadn’t known anything about those false gods. Those gods were new to them. Their people of long ago didn’t worship them."
Deuteronomy,32,18,But then they deserted the Rock. He was their Father. They forgot the God who created them.
Deuteronomy,32,19,"When the Lord saw this, he turned away from them. His sons and daughters made him angry."
Deuteronomy,32,20,"“I will turn my face away from them,” he said. “I will see what will happen to them in the end. They are sinful people. They are unfaithful children."

Deuteronomy,32,27,"But I was afraid their enemies would make fun of that. I was afraid their attackers would not understand. I was sure they would say, ‘We’re the ones who’ve beaten them! The Lord isn’t the one who did it.’ ”"
Deuteronomy,32,28,Israel is a nation that doesn’t have any sense. They can’t understand anything.
Deuteronomy,32,29,I wish they were wise. Then they would understand what’s coming. They’d realize what would happen to them in the end.
Deuteronomy,32,30,How could one person chase a thousand? How could two make ten thousand run away? It couldn’t happen unless their Rock had deserted them. It couldn’t take place unless the Lord had given them up.
Deuteronomy,32,31,Their rock is not like our Rock. Even our enemies know that.
Deuteronomy,32,32,Their vine comes from the vines of Sodom. It comes from the vineyards of Gomorrah. Their grapes are filled with poison. Their bunches of grapes taste bitter.
