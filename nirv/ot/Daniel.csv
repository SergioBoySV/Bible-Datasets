Daniel,1,1,"It was the third year that Jehoiakim was king of Judah. Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem. His armies surrounded the city and attacked it."
Daniel,1,2,"The Lord handed Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, over to him. Nebuchadnezzar also took some of the objects from God’s temple. He carried them off to the temple of his god in Babylon. He put them among the treasures of his god."
Daniel,1,3,The king gave Ashpenaz an order. Ashpenaz was the chief of Nebuchadnezzar’s court officials. The king told him to bring him some of the Israelites. The king wanted them to serve him in his court. He wanted nobles and men from the royal family.
Daniel,1,4,He was looking for young men who were healthy and handsome. They had to be able to learn anything. They had to be well educated. They had to have the ability to understand new things quickly and easily. The king wanted men who could serve in his palace. Ashpenaz was supposed to teach them the Babylonian language and writings.
Daniel,1,5,"The king had his servants give them food and wine from his own table. They received a certain amount every day. The young men had to be trained for three years. After that, they could begin to serve the king."
Daniel,1,6,"Some of the men chosen were from Judah. Their names were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah."
Daniel,1,7,The chief official gave them new names. He gave Daniel the name Belteshazzar. He gave Hananiah the name Shadrach. He gave Mishael the name Meshach. And he gave Azariah the name Abednego.
Daniel,1,8,Daniel decided not to make himself “unclean” by eating the king’s food and drinking his wine. So he asked the chief official for a favor. He wanted permission not to make himself “unclean” with the king’s food and wine.
Daniel,1,9,God had caused the official to be kind and friendly to Daniel.
Daniel,1,10,"But the official refused to do what Daniel asked for. He said, “I’m afraid of the king. He is my master. He has decided what you and your three friends must eat and drink. Other young men are the same age as you. Why should he see you looking worse than them? When he sees how you look, he might kill me.”"
Daniel,1,11,"So Daniel spoke to one of the guards. The chief official had appointed him over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah."
Daniel,1,12,"Daniel said to him, “Please test us for ten days. Give us nothing but vegetables to eat. And give us only water to drink."
Daniel,1,13,"Then compare us with the young men who eat the king’s food. See how we look. After that, do what you want to.”"
Daniel,1,14,So the guard agreed. He tested them for ten days.
Daniel,1,15,"After the ten days Daniel and his friends looked healthy and well fed. In fact, they looked better than any of the young men who ate the king’s food."
Daniel,1,16,So the guard didn’t require them to eat the king’s special food. He didn’t require them to drink the king’s wine either. He gave them vegetables instead.
Daniel,1,17,God gave knowledge and understanding to these four young men. So they understood all kinds of writings and subjects. And Daniel could understand all kinds of visions and dreams.
Daniel,1,18,The three years the king had set for their training ended. So the chief official brought them to Nebuchadnezzar.
Daniel,1,19,"The king talked with them. He didn’t find anyone equal to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah. So they began to serve the king."
Daniel,1,20,He asked them for advice in matters that required wisdom and understanding. The king always found their answers to be the best. Other men in his kingdom claimed to get knowledge by using magic. But the answers of Daniel and his friends were ten times better than theirs.
Daniel,1,21,Daniel served in Babylon until the first year Cyrus ruled over the land of Babylon. Cyrus was king of Persia.
Daniel,2,1,"In the second year of Nebuchadnezzar’s rule, he had a dream. His mind was troubled. He couldn’t sleep."
Daniel,2,2,So the king sent for those who claimed to get knowledge by using magic. He also sent for those who practiced evil magic and those who studied the heavens. He wanted them to tell him what he had dreamed. They came in and stood in front of the king.
Daniel,2,3,"He said to them, “I had a dream. It troubles me. So I want to know what it means.”"
Daniel,2,4,"Then those who studied the heavens answered the king. They spoke in Aramaic. They said, “King Nebuchadnezzar, may you live forever! Tell us what you dreamed. Then we’ll explain what it means.”"
Daniel,2,5,"The king replied to them, “I have made up my mind. You must tell me what I dreamed. And you must tell me what it means. If you don’t, I’ll have you cut to pieces. And I’ll have your houses turned into piles of trash."
Daniel,2,6,So tell me what I dreamed. Explain it to me. Then I’ll give you gifts. I’ll reward you. I’ll give you great honor. So tell me the dream. And tell me what it means.”
Daniel,2,7,"Once more they replied, “King Nebuchadnezzar, tell us what you dreamed. Then we’ll tell you what it means.”"
Daniel,2,8,"The king answered, “I know what you are doing. You are trying to gain more time. You realize that I’ve made up my mind."
Daniel,2,9,"You must tell me the dream. If you don’t, you will pay for it. You have gotten together and made evil plans. You hope things will change. So you are telling me lies. But I want you to tell me what I dreamed. Then I’ll know that you can tell me what it means.”"
Daniel,2,10,"They answered the king, “There is no one on earth who can do what you are asking! No king has ever asked for anything like that. Not even a king as great and mighty as you has asked for it. Those who get knowledge by using magic have never been asked to do what you are asking. And those who study the heavens haven’t been asked to do it either."
Daniel,2,11,What you are asking is much too hard. No one can tell you what you dreamed except the gods. And they don’t live among human beings.”
Daniel,2,12,That made the king very angry. He ordered that all the wise men in Babylon be put to death.
Daniel,2,13,So the order was given to kill them. Men were sent out to look for Daniel and his friends. They were also supposed to be put to death.
Daniel,2,14,Arioch was the commander of the king’s guard. He went out to put the wise men of Babylon to death. So Daniel spoke to him wisely and carefully.
Daniel,2,15,"He asked the king’s officer, “Why did Nebuchadnezzar give a terrible order like that?” Then Arioch explained to Daniel what was going on."
Daniel,2,16,"When Daniel heard that, he went to the king. He told him he would explain the dream to him. But he needed more time."
Daniel,2,17,"Then Daniel returned to his house. He explained everything to his friends Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah."
Daniel,2,18,He asked them to pray that the God of heaven would give him mercy. He wanted God to help him understand the mystery of the king’s dream. Then he and his friends wouldn’t be killed along with Babylon’s other wise men.
Daniel,2,19,"During that night, God gave Daniel a vision. He showed him what the mystery was all about. Then Daniel praised the God of heaven."
Daniel,2,20,"He said, “May God be praised for ever and ever! He is wise and powerful."
Daniel,2,21,He changes times and seasons. He removes some kings from power. He causes other kings to rule. The wisdom of those who are wise comes from him. He gives knowledge to those who have understanding.
Daniel,2,22,"He explains deep and hidden things. He knows what happens in the darkest places. And where he is, everything is light."
Daniel,2,23,"God of my people of long ago, I thank and praise you. You have given me wisdom and power. You have made known to me what we asked you for. You have shown us the king’s dream.”"
Daniel,2,24,"Then Daniel went to Arioch. The king had appointed him to put the wise men of Babylon to death. Daniel said to him, “Don’t kill the wise men of Babylon. Take me to the king. I’ll tell him what his dream means.”"
Daniel,2,25,"So Arioch took Daniel to the king at once. Arioch said, “I have found a man among those you brought here from Judah. He can tell you what your dream means.”"
Daniel,2,26,"Nebuchadnezzar spoke to Daniel, who was also called Belteshazzar. The king asked him, “Are you able to tell me what I saw in my dream? And can you tell me what it means?”"
Daniel,2,27,"Daniel replied, “You have asked us to explain a mystery to you. But no wise man can do that. And those who try to figure things out by using magic can’t do it either."
Daniel,2,28,"But there is a God in heaven who can explain mysteries. King Nebuchadnezzar, he has shown you what is going to happen. Here is what you dreamed while lying in bed. And here are the visions that passed through your mind."
Daniel,2,29,"“Your Majesty, while you were still in bed your mind was troubled. You were thinking about things that haven’t happened yet. The God who explains mysteries showed these things to you."
Daniel,2,30,"Now the mystery has been explained to me. But it isn’t because I have greater wisdom than anyone else alive. It’s because God wants you to know what the mystery means, Your Majesty. He wants you to understand what went through your mind."
Daniel,2,31,"“King Nebuchadnezzar, you looked up and saw a large statue standing in front of you. It was huge. It shone brightly. And it terrified you."
Daniel,2,32,The head of the statue was made out of pure gold. Its chest and arms were made out of silver. Its stomach and thighs were made out of bronze.
Daniel,2,33,Its legs were made out of iron. And its feet were partly iron and partly baked clay.
Daniel,2,34,"While you were watching, a rock was cut out. But human hands didn’t do it. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay. It smashed them."
Daniel,2,35,"Then the iron and clay were broken to pieces. So were the bronze, silver and gold. All of them were broken to pieces. They became like straw on a threshing floor at harvest time. The wind blew them away without leaving a trace. But the rock that struck the statue became a huge mountain. It filled the whole earth."
Daniel,2,36,“This was your dream. Now I will tell you what it means.
Daniel,2,37,"King Nebuchadnezzar, you are the greatest king of all. The God of heaven has given you authority and power. He has given you might and glory."
Daniel,2,38,He has put everyone under your control. He has also given you authority over the wild animals and the birds in the sky. It doesn’t matter where they live. He has made you ruler over all of them. You are that head of gold.
Daniel,2,39,"“After you, another kingdom will take over. It won’t be as powerful as yours. Next, a third kingdom will rule over the whole earth. The bronze part of the statue stands for that kingdom."
Daniel,2,40,"Finally, there will be a fourth kingdom. It will be as strong as iron. Iron breaks and smashes everything to pieces. And the fourth kingdom will crush and break all the others."
Daniel,2,41,You saw that the feet and toes were made out of iron and baked clay. And the fourth kingdom will be divided up. But it will still have some of the strength of iron. That’s why you saw iron mixed with clay.
Daniel,2,42,The toes were partly iron and partly clay. And the fourth kingdom will be partly strong and partly weak.
Daniel,2,43,You saw the iron mixed with baked clay. And the fourth kingdom will be made up of all kinds of people. They won’t hold together any more than iron mixes with clay.
Daniel,2,44,"“In the time of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom. It will never be destroyed. And no other nation will ever take it over. It will crush all those other kingdoms. It will bring them to an end. But it will last forever."
Daniel,2,45,"That’s what the vision of the rock cut out of a mountain means. Human hands didn’t cut out the rock. It broke the statue to pieces. It smashed the iron, bronze, clay, silver and gold. “The great God has shown you what will take place in days to come. The dream is true. And you can trust the meaning of it that I have explained to you.”"
Daniel,2,46,Then King Nebuchadnezzar bowed low in front of Daniel. He wanted to honor him. So he ordered that an offering and incense be offered up to him.
Daniel,2,47,"The king said to Daniel, “I’m sure your God is the greatest God of all. He is the Lord of kings. He explains mysteries. That’s why you were able to explain the mystery of my dream.”"
Daniel,2,48,Then the king put Daniel in a position of authority. He gave him many gifts. He made him ruler over the city of Babylon and the towns around it. He put him in charge of all its other wise men.
Daniel,2,49,"The king also did what Daniel asked him to. He appointed Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego to help Daniel govern Babylon and the towns around it. Daniel himself remained at the royal court."
Daniel,3,1,King Nebuchadnezzar made a gold statue. It was 90 feet tall and 9 feet wide. He set it up on the plain of Dura near the city of Babylon.
Daniel,3,2,"Then the king sent for the royal rulers, high officials and governors. He sent for the advisers, treasurers, judges and court officers. And he sent for all the other officials of Babylon. He asked them to come to a special gathering to honor the statue he had set up."
Daniel,3,3,"So the royal rulers, high officials and governors came together. So did the advisers, treasurers, judges and court officers. All the other officials joined them. They came to honor the statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. They stood in front of it."
Daniel,3,4,"Then a messenger called out loudly, “Listen, you people who come from every nation! Pay attention, you who speak other languages! Here is what the king commands you to do."
Daniel,3,5,"You will soon hear the sound of horns and flutes. You will hear zithers, lyres, harps and pipes. In fact, you will hear all kinds of music. When you do, you must fall down and worship the gold statue. That is the statue that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up."
Daniel,3,6,"If you don’t, you will be thrown into a blazing furnace right away.”"
Daniel,3,7,"All the people heard the sound of the horns and flutes. They heard the zithers, lyres, harps and other musical instruments. As soon as they did, they fell down and worshiped Nebuchadnezzar’s gold statue. They were people from all nations no matter what language they spoke."
Daniel,3,8,At this time some people who studied the heavens came forward. They spoke against the Jews.
Daniel,3,9,"They said, “King Nebuchadnezzar, may you live forever!"
Daniel,3,10,"Your Majesty has commanded everyone to fall down and worship the gold statue. You told them to do it when they heard the horns, flutes, zithers, lyres, harps, pipes and other musical instruments."
Daniel,3,11,"If they didn’t, they would be thrown into a blazing furnace."
Daniel,3,12,"But you have appointed some Jews to help Daniel govern Babylon and the towns around it. Their names are Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. They don’t pay any attention to you, King Nebuchadnezzar. They don’t serve your gods. And they refuse to worship the gold statue you have set up.”"
Daniel,3,13,"Nebuchadnezzar was very angry. He sent for Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. So they were brought to him."
Daniel,3,14,"The king said to them, “Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, is what I heard about you true? Don’t you serve my gods? Don’t you worship the gold statue I set up?"
Daniel,3,15,"You will hear the horns, flutes, zithers, lyres, harps, pipes and other musical instruments. When you do, fall down and worship the statue I made. If you will, that’s very good. But if you won’t, you will be thrown at once into a blazing furnace. Then what god will be able to save you from my power?”"
Daniel,3,16,"Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego replied to him. They said, “King Nebuchadnezzar, we don’t need to talk about this anymore."
Daniel,3,17,We might be thrown into the blazing furnace. But the God we serve is able to bring us out of it alive. He will save us from your power.
Daniel,3,18,"But we want you to know this, Your Majesty. Even if we knew that our God wouldn’t save us, we still wouldn’t serve your gods. We wouldn’t worship the gold statue you set up.”"
Daniel,3,19,"Then Nebuchadnezzar was very angry with Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. The look on his face changed. And he ordered that the furnace be heated seven times hotter than usual."
Daniel,3,20,"He also gave some of the strongest soldiers in his army a command. He ordered them to tie up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. Then he told his men to throw them into the blazing furnace."
Daniel,3,21,"So they were tied up. Then they were thrown into the furnace. They were wearing their robes, pants, turbans and other clothes."
Daniel,3,22,"The king’s command was carried out quickly. The furnace was so hot that its flames killed the soldiers who threw Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego into it."
Daniel,3,23,So the three men were firmly tied up. And they fell into the blazing furnace.
Daniel,3,24,"Then King Nebuchadnezzar leaped to his feet. He was so amazed he asked his advisers, “Didn’t we tie up three men? Didn’t we throw three men into the fire?” They replied, “Yes, we did, Your Majesty.”"
Daniel,3,25,"The king said, “Look! I see four men walking around in the fire. They aren’t tied up. And the fire hasn’t even harmed them. The fourth man looks like a son of the gods.”"
Daniel,3,26,"Then the king approached the opening of the blazing furnace. He shouted, “Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, come out! You who serve the Most High God, come here!” So they came out of the fire."
Daniel,3,27,"The royal rulers, high officials, governors and advisers crowded around them. They saw that the fire hadn’t harmed their bodies. Not one hair on their heads was burned. Their robes weren’t burned either. And they didn’t even smell like smoke."
Daniel,3,28,"Then Nebuchadnezzar said, “May the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego be praised! He has sent his angel and saved his servants. They trusted in him. They refused to obey my command. They were willing to give up their lives. They would rather die than serve or worship any god except their own God."
Daniel,3,29,"No other god can save people this way. So I’m giving an order about the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. No one may say anything against him. That’s true no matter what language they speak. If they say anything against him, they’ll be cut to pieces. And their houses will be turned into piles of trash.”"
Daniel,3,30,"Then the king honored Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. He gave them higher positions in the city of Babylon and the towns around it."
Daniel,4,1,"I, King Nebuchadnezzar, am writing this letter. I am sending it to people who live all over the world. I’m sending it to people of every nation no matter what language they speak. May you have great success!"
Daniel,4,2,I am pleased to tell you what has happened. The Most High God has done miraculous signs and wonders for me.
Daniel,4,3,His signs are great. His wonders are mighty. His kingdom will last forever. His rule will never end.
Daniel,4,4,I was at home in my palace. I was content and very successful.
Daniel,4,5,But I had a dream that made me afraid. I was lying in bed. Then dreams and visions passed through my mind. They terrified me.
Daniel,4,6,So I commanded that all the wise men in Babylon be brought to me. I wanted them to tell me what my dream meant.
Daniel,4,7,Those who try to figure things out by using magic came. So did those who study the heavens. I told all of them what I had dreamed. But they couldn’t tell me what it meant.
Daniel,4,8,"Finally, Daniel came to me. He is called Belteshazzar, after the name of my god. The spirit of the holy gods is in him. I told him my dream."
Daniel,4,9,"I said, “Belteshazzar, you are chief of the magicians. I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you. No mystery is too hard for you to figure out. Here is my dream. Tell me what it means."
Daniel,4,10,Here are the visions I saw while I was lying in bed. I looked up and saw a tree standing in the middle of the land. It was very tall.
Daniel,4,11,It had grown to be large and strong. Its top touched the sky. It could be seen anywhere on earth.
Daniel,4,12,"Its leaves were beautiful. It had a lot of fruit on it. It provided enough food for people and animals. Under the tree, the wild animals found safety. The birds lived in its branches. Every creature was fed from that tree."
Daniel,4,13,"“While I was still lying in bed, I looked up. In my visions, I saw a holy one. He was a messenger. He was coming down from heaven."
Daniel,4,14,"He called out in a loud voice. He said, ‘Cut down the tree. Break off its branches. Strip off its leaves. Scatter its fruit. Let the animals under it run away. Let the birds in its branches fly off."
Daniel,4,15,But leave the stump with its roots in the ground. Let it stay in the field. Put a band of iron and bronze around it. “ ‘Let King Nebuchadnezzar become wet with the dew of heaven. Let him live with the animals among the plants of the earth.
Daniel,4,16,"Let him no longer have the mind of a man. Instead, let him be given the mind of an animal. Let him stay that way until seven periods of time pass by."
Daniel,4,17,“ ‘The decision is announced by holy messengers. So all who are alive will know that the Most High God is King. He rules over all kingdoms on earth. He gives them to anyone he wants. Sometimes he puts the least important people in charge of them.’
Daniel,4,18,"“This is the dream I, King Nebuchadnezzar, had. Now tell me what it means, Belteshazzar. None of the wise men in my kingdom can explain it to me. But you can. After all, the spirit of the holy gods is in you.”"
Daniel,4,19,"Daniel, who was also called Belteshazzar, was very bewildered for a while. His thoughts terrified him. So the king said, “Belteshazzar, don’t let the dream or its meaning make you afraid.” Belteshazzar answered, “My master, I wish the dream were about your enemies! I wish its meaning had to do with them!"
Daniel,4,20,You saw a tree. It grew to be large and strong. Its top touched the sky. It could be seen from anywhere on earth.
Daniel,4,21,"Its leaves were beautiful. It had a lot of fruit on it. It provided enough food for people and animals. Under the tree, the wild animals found safety. The birds lived in its branches."
Daniel,4,22,"Your Majesty, you are that tree! You have become great and strong. Your greatness has grown until it reaches the sky. Your rule has spread to all parts of the earth."
Daniel,4,23,"“Your Majesty, you saw a holy one. He was a messenger. He came down from heaven. He said, ‘Cut down the tree. Destroy it. But leave the stump with its roots in the ground. Let it stay in the field. Put an iron and bronze band around it. Let King Nebuchadnezzar become wet with the dew of heaven. Let him live with the wild animals. Let him stay that way until seven periods of time pass by.’"
Daniel,4,24,"“Your Majesty, here is what your dream means. The Most High God has given an order against you."
Daniel,4,25,You will be driven away from people. You will live with the wild animals. You will eat grass just as an ox does. You will become wet with the dew of heaven. Seven periods of time will pass by for you. Then you will recognize that the Most High God rules over all kingdoms on earth. He gives them to anyone he wants.
Daniel,4,26,But he gave a command to leave the stump of the tree along with its roots. That means your kingdom will be given back to you. It will happen when you recognize that the God of heaven rules.
Daniel,4,27,"So, Your Majesty, I hope you will accept my advice. Stop being sinful. Do what is right. Give up your evil practices. Show kindness to those who are being treated badly. Then perhaps things will continue to go well with you.”"
Daniel,4,28,All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar.
Daniel,4,29,It took place twelve months later. He was walking on the roof of his palace in Babylon.
Daniel,4,30,"He said, “Isn’t this the great Babylon I have built as a place for my royal palace? I used my mighty power to build it. It shows how glorious my majesty is.”"
Daniel,4,31,"He was still speaking when he heard a voice from heaven. It said, “King Nebuchadnezzar, here is what has been ordered concerning you. Your royal authority has been taken from you."
Daniel,4,32,You will be driven away from people. You will live with the wild animals. You will eat grass just as an ox does. Seven periods of time will pass by for you. Then you will recognize that the Most High God rules over all kingdoms on earth. He gives them to anyone he wants.”
Daniel,4,33,What had been said about King Nebuchadnezzar came true at once. He was driven away from people. He ate grass just as an ox does. His body became wet with the dew of heaven. He stayed that way until his hair grew like the feathers of an eagle. His nails became like the claws of a bird.
Daniel,4,34,"At the end of that time I, Nebuchadnezzar, looked up toward heaven. My mind became clear again. Then I praised the Most High God. I gave honor and glory to the God who lives forever. His rule will last forever. His kingdom will never end."
Daniel,4,35,"He considers all the nations on earth to be nothing. He does as he pleases with the powers of heaven. He does what he wants with the nations of the earth. No one can hold back his hand. No one can say to him, “What have you done?”"
Daniel,4,36,My honor and glory were returned to me when my mind became clear again. The glory of my kingdom was given back to me. My advisers and nobles came to me. And I was put back on my throne. I became even greater than I had been before.
Daniel,4,37,"Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, give praise and honor and glory to the King of heaven. Everything he does is right. All his ways are fair. He is able to bring down those who live proudly."
Daniel,5,1,King Belshazzar gave a huge banquet. He invited a thousand of his nobles to it. He drank wine with them.
Daniel,5,2,"While Belshazzar was drinking his wine, he gave orders to his servants. He commanded them to bring in some gold and silver cups. They were the cups his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem. Belshazzar had them brought in so everyone could drink from them. That included the king himself, his nobles, his wives and his concubines."
Daniel,5,3,So the servants brought in the gold cups. The cups had been taken from God’s temple in Jerusalem. The king and his nobles drank from them. So did his wives and concubines.
Daniel,5,4,"As they drank the wine, they praised their gods. The statues of those gods were made out of gold, silver, bronze, iron, wood or stone."
Daniel,5,5,Suddenly the fingers of a human hand appeared. They wrote something on the plaster of the palace wall. It happened near the lampstand. The king watched the hand as it wrote.
Daniel,5,6,His face turned pale. He was so afraid that his legs became weak. And his knees were knocking together.
Daniel,5,7,"The king sent for those who try to figure things out by using magic. He also sent for those who study the heavens. All of them were wise men in Babylon. Then the king spoke to them. He said, “I want one of you to read this writing. I want you to tell me what it means. Whoever does this will be dressed in purple clothes. A gold chain will be put around his neck. And he will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom.”"
Daniel,5,8,Then all the king’s wise men came in. But they couldn’t read the writing. They couldn’t tell him what it meant.
Daniel,5,9,So King Belshazzar became even more terrified. His face grew more pale. And his nobles were bewildered.
Daniel,5,10,"The queen heard the king and his nobles talking. So she came into the dining hall. “King Belshazzar, may you live forever!” she said. “Don’t be afraid! Don’t look so pale!"
Daniel,5,11,"I know a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods in him. He has understanding and wisdom and good sense just like the gods. He was chief of those who tried to figure things out by using magic. And he was in charge of those who studied the heavens. Your father, King Nebuchadnezzar, appointed him to that position."
Daniel,5,12,King Nebuchadnezzar did this because he saw what the man could do. This man’s name is Daniel. Your father called him Belteshazzar. He has a clever mind and knowledge and understanding. He is also able to tell what dreams mean. He can explain riddles and solve hard problems. Send for him. He’ll tell you what the writing means.”
Daniel,5,13,"So Daniel was brought to the king. The king said to him, “Are you Daniel? Are you one of the prisoners my father the king brought here from Judah?"
Daniel,5,14,I have heard that the spirit of the gods is in you. I’ve also heard that you have understanding and good sense and special wisdom.
Daniel,5,15,The wise men and those who practice magic were brought to me. They were asked to read this writing and tell me what it means. But they couldn’t.
Daniel,5,16,"I have heard that you are able to explain things and solve hard problems. I hope you can read this writing and tell me what it means. If you can, you will be dressed in purple clothes. A gold chain will be put around your neck. And you will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom.”"
Daniel,5,17,"Then Daniel answered the king. He said, “You can keep your gifts for yourself. You can give your rewards to someone else. But I will read the writing for you. I’ll tell you what it means."
Daniel,5,18,"“Your Majesty, the Most High God was good to your father Nebuchadnezzar. He gave him authority and greatness and glory and honor."
Daniel,5,19,God gave him a high position. Then people from every nation became afraid of the king. That was true no matter what language they spoke. The king put to death anyone he wanted to. He spared anyone he wanted to spare. He gave high positions to anyone he wanted to. And he brought down anyone he wanted to bring down.
Daniel,5,20,But his heart became very stubborn and proud. So he was removed from his royal throne. His glory was stripped away from him.
Daniel,5,21,He was driven away from people. He was given the mind of an animal. He lived with the wild donkeys. He ate grass just as an ox does. His body became wet with the dew of heaven. He stayed that way until he recognized that the Most High God rules over all kingdoms on earth. He puts anyone he wants to in charge of them.
Daniel,5,22,"“But you knew all that, Belshazzar. After all, you are Nebuchadnezzar’s son. In spite of that, you are still proud."
Daniel,5,23,"You have taken your stand against the Lord of heaven. You had your servants bring cups from his temple to you. You and your nobles drank wine from them. So did your wives and concubines. You praised your gods. The statues of those gods are made out of silver, gold, bronze, iron, wood or stone. They can’t see or hear or understand anything. But you didn’t honor God. He holds in his hand your very life and everything you do."
Daniel,5,24,So he sent the hand that wrote on the wall.
Daniel,5,25,"“Here is what was written. mene, mene, tekel, parsin"
Daniel,5,26,“And here is what these words mean. “The word Mene means that God has limited the time of your rule. He has brought it to an end.
Daniel,5,27,“The word Tekel means that you have been weighed on scales. And you haven’t measured up to God’s standard.
Daniel,5,28,“The word Peres means that your authority over your kingdom will be taken away from you. It will be given to the Medes and Persians.”
Daniel,5,29,Then Belshazzar commanded his servants to dress Daniel in purple clothes. So they did. They put a gold chain around his neck. And he was made the third highest ruler in the kingdom.
Daniel,5,30,"That very night Belshazzar, the king of Babylon, was killed."
Daniel,5,31,His kingdom was given to Darius the Mede. Darius was 62 years old.
Daniel,6,1,It pleased Darius to appoint 120 royal rulers over his entire kingdom.
Daniel,6,2,He placed three leaders over them. One of the leaders was Daniel. The royal rulers were made accountable to the three leaders. Then the king wouldn’t lose any of his wealth.
Daniel,6,3,Daniel did a better job than the other two leaders or any of the royal rulers. He was an unusually good and able man. So the king planned to put him in charge of the whole kingdom.
Daniel,6,4,But the other two leaders and the royal rulers heard about it. So they looked for a reason to bring charges against Daniel. They tried to find something wrong with the way he ran the government. But they weren’t able to. They couldn’t find any fault with his work. He could always be trusted. He never did anything wrong. And he always did what he was supposed to.
Daniel,6,5,"Finally these men said, “We want to bring charges against this man Daniel. But it’s almost impossible for us to come up with a reason to do it. If we find a reason, it will have to be in connection with the law of his God.”"
Daniel,6,6,"So the two leaders and the royal rulers went as a group to the king. They said, “King Darius, may you live forever!"
Daniel,6,7,"All the royal leaders, high officials, royal rulers, advisers and governors want to make a suggestion. We’ve agreed that you should give an order. And you should make sure it’s obeyed. Your Majesty, here is the command you should make your people obey for the next 30 days. Don’t let any of your people pray to any god or human being except to you. If they do, throw them into the lions’ den."
Daniel,6,8,Now give the order. Write it down in the law of the Medes and Persians. Then it can’t be changed.”
Daniel,6,9,So King Darius put the order in writing.
Daniel,6,10,"Daniel found out that the king had signed the order. In spite of that, he did just as he had always done before. He went home to his upstairs room. Its windows opened toward Jerusalem. He went to his room three times a day to pray. He got down on his knees and gave thanks to his God."
Daniel,6,11,Some of the other royal officials went to where Daniel was staying. They saw him praying and asking God for help.
Daniel,6,12,"So they went to the king. They spoke to him about his royal order. They said, “Your Majesty, didn’t you sign an official order? It said that for the next 30 days your people could pray only to you. They could not pray to anyone else, whether god or human being. If they did, they would be thrown into the lions’ den.” The king answered, “The order must still be obeyed. It’s what the law of the Medes and Persians requires. So it can’t be changed.”"
Daniel,6,13,"Then they spoke to the king again. They said, “Daniel is one of the prisoners from Judah. He doesn’t pay any attention to you, Your Majesty. He doesn’t obey the order you put in writing. He still prays to his God three times a day.”"
Daniel,6,14,"When the king heard this, he was very upset. He didn’t want Daniel to be harmed in any way. Until sunset, he did everything he could to save him."
Daniel,6,15,"Then the men went as a group to King Darius. They said to him, “Your Majesty, remember that no order or command you give can be changed. That’s what the law of the Medes and Persians requires.”"
Daniel,6,16,"So the king gave the order. Daniel was brought out and thrown into the lions’ den. The king said to him, “You always serve your God faithfully. So may he save you!”"
Daniel,6,17,A stone was brought and placed over the opening of the den. The king sealed it with his own special ring. He also sealed it with the rings of his nobles. Then nothing could be done to help Daniel.
Daniel,6,18,The king returned to his palace. He didn’t eat anything that night. He didn’t ask for anything to be brought to him for his enjoyment. And he couldn’t sleep.
Daniel,6,19,"As soon as the sun began to rise, the king got up. He hurried to the lions’ den."
Daniel,6,20,"When he got near it, he called out to Daniel. His voice was filled with great concern. He said, “Daniel! You serve the living God. You always serve him faithfully. So has he been able to save you from the lions?”"
Daniel,6,21,"Daniel answered, “Your Majesty, may you live forever!"
Daniel,6,22,"My God sent his angel. And his angel shut the mouths of the lions. They haven’t hurt me at all. That’s because I haven’t done anything wrong in God’s sight. I’ve never done anything wrong to you either, Your Majesty.”"
Daniel,6,23,The king was filled with joy. He ordered his servants to lift Daniel out of the den. So they did. They didn’t see any wounds on him. That’s because he had trusted in his God.
Daniel,6,24,"Then the king gave another order. The men who had said bad things about Daniel were brought in. They were thrown into the lions’ den. So were their wives and children. Before they hit the bottom of the den, the lions attacked them. And the lions crushed all their bones."
Daniel,6,25,"Then King Darius wrote to people of all nations, no matter what language they spoke. He said, “May you have great success!"
Daniel,6,26,“I order people in every part of my kingdom to respect and honor Daniel’s God. “He is the living God. He will live forever. His kingdom will not be destroyed. His rule will never end.
Daniel,6,27,He sets people free and saves them. He does miraculous signs and wonders. He does them in the heavens and on the earth. He has saved Daniel from the power of the lions.”
Daniel,6,28,"So Daniel had success while Darius was king. Things went well with Daniel during the rule of Cyrus, the Persian."
Daniel,7,1,"It was the first year that Belshazzar was king of Babylon. Daniel had a dream. He was lying in bed. In his dream, visions passed through his mind. He wrote down what he saw."
Daniel,7,2,"Daniel said, “I had a vision at night. I looked up and saw the four winds of heaven. They were stirring up the Mediterranean Sea."
Daniel,7,3,Four large animals came up out of the sea. Each one was different from the others.
Daniel,7,4,“The first animal was like a lion. It had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were torn off. Then it was lifted up from the ground. It stood on two feet like a human being. And the mind of a human being was given to it.
Daniel,7,5,"“I saw a second animal. It looked like a bear. It was raised up on one of its sides. And it had three ribs between its teeth. It was told, ‘Get up! Eat meat until you are full!’"
Daniel,7,6,"“After that, I saw another animal. It looked like a leopard. On its back were four wings like the wings of a bird. The animal I saw had four heads. And it was given authority to rule."
Daniel,7,7,"“After that, in my vision I looked up and saw a fourth animal. It was terrifying and very powerful. It had large iron teeth. It crushed those it attacked and ate them up. It stomped on anything that was left. It was different from the other animals. And it had ten horns."
Daniel,7,8,“I thought about the horns. Then I saw another horn. It was a little one. It grew up among the other horns. Three of the first horns were pulled up by their roots to make room for it. The little horn had eyes like the eyes of a human being. Its mouth was always bragging.
Daniel,7,9,"“As I watched, “thrones were set in place. The Eternal God took his seat. His clothes were as white as snow. The hair on his head was white like wool. His throne was blazing with fire. And flames were all around its wheels."
Daniel,7,10,A river of fire was flowing. It was coming out from in front of God. Thousands and thousands of angels served him. Millions of them stood in front of him. The court was seated. And the books were opened.
Daniel,7,11,“Then I continued to watch because of the way the horn was bragging. I kept looking until the fourth animal was killed. I watched until its body was destroyed. It was thrown into the blazing fire.
Daniel,7,12,The authority of the other animals had been stripped away from them. But they were allowed to live for a period of time.
Daniel,7,13,“In my vision I saw one who looked like a son of man. He was coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Eternal God. He was led right up to him.
Daniel,7,14,"And he was given authority, glory and a kingdom. People of all nations, no matter what language they spoke, worshiped him. His authority will last forever. It will not pass away. His kingdom will never be destroyed."
Daniel,7,15,“My spirit was troubled. The visions that passed through my mind upset me.
Daniel,7,16,I approached an angel who was standing there. I asked him what all these things really meant. “So he explained to me what everything meant.
Daniel,7,17,"He said, ‘The four large animals stand for four kings. The kings will appear on the earth."
Daniel,7,18,But the holy people of the Most High God will receive the kingdom. They will possess it forever. It will belong to them for ever and ever.’
Daniel,7,19,“Then I wanted to know what the fourth animal stood for. It was different from the others. It was the most terrifying of all. It had iron teeth and bronze claws. It crushed everyone it attacked and ate them up. It stomped on anything that was left.
Daniel,7,20,I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head. And I wanted to know about the other horn that grew up later. It caused three of the ten horns to fall out. It appeared to be stronger than the others. It had eyes. And its mouth was always bragging.
Daniel,7,21,I saw that the horn was at war with God’s holy people. It was winning the battle over them.
Daniel,7,22,But then the Eternal God came. He decided in favor of his holy people. So the time came when the kingdom was given to them.
Daniel,7,23,"“Here’s how the angel explained it to me. He said, ‘The fourth animal stands for a fourth kingdom. It will appear on earth. It will be different from the other kingdoms. It will eat up the whole earth. It will stomp on it and crush it."
Daniel,7,24,The ten horns stand for ten kings. They will come from the fourth kingdom. After them another king will appear. He will be different from the earlier ones. He’ll bring three kings under his control.
Daniel,7,25,He’ll speak against the Most High God. He’ll treat God’s holy people badly. He will try to change the times and laws that were given by God. God’s holy people will be placed under his power for three and a half years.
Daniel,7,26,“ ‘But the court will be seated. And the power of that king will be taken away from him. It will be completely destroyed forever.
Daniel,7,27,"Then the authority, power and greatness of all the kingdoms on earth will be taken from them. And all they had will be given to the holy people of the Most High God. His kingdom will last forever. Every ruler will worship and obey him.’"
Daniel,7,28,“That’s all I saw. My thoughts deeply troubled me. My face turned pale. But I kept those things to myself.”
Daniel,8,1,"It was the third year of King Belshazzar’s rule. After the vision that had already appeared to me, I had another one."
Daniel,8,2,In my vision I saw myself in the city of Susa. It has high walls around it. It is in the land of Elam. In the vision I was beside the Ulai Canal.
Daniel,8,3,I looked up and saw a ram that had two horns. It was standing beside the canal. Its horns were long. One of them was longer than the other. But that horn grew up later.
Daniel,8,4,I watched the ram as it charged toward the west. It also charged toward the north and the south. No animal could stand up against it. Not one of them could save anyone from its power. It did as it pleased. And it became great.
Daniel,8,5,I was thinking about all of this. Then a goat suddenly came from the west. It had a large horn between its eyes. The goat raced across the whole earth without even touching the ground.
Daniel,8,6,It came toward the ram that had the two horns. It was the ram I had seen standing beside the canal. The goat was very angry. It charged at the ram.
Daniel,8,7,I saw it attack the ram with mighty force. It struck the ram and broke the ram’s two horns. The ram didn’t have the power to stand up against it. The goat knocked the ram to the ground and stomped on it. No one could save the ram from the goat’s power.
Daniel,8,8,"The goat became very great. But when its power was at its greatest, the goat’s large horn was broken off. In its place four large horns grew up toward the four winds of heaven."
Daniel,8,9,Out of one of the four horns came another horn. It was small at first but became more and more powerful. It grew to the south and to the east and toward the beautiful land of Israel.
Daniel,8,10,It grew until it reached the stars in the sky. It threw some of them down to the earth. And it stomped on them.
Daniel,8,11,It set itself up to be as great as the commander of the Lord ’s army. It took away the daily sacrifices from the Lord . And his temple in Jerusalem was thrown down.
Daniel,8,12,"Because many of the Lord ’s people refused to obey him, they were handed over to the horn. The daily sacrifices were also given over to it. The horn was successful no matter what it did. And true worship of God was thrown down to the ground."
Daniel,8,13,"Then I heard a holy angel speaking. Another holy angel spoke to him. He asked, “How long will it take for the vision to come true? When will the daily sacrifices be stopped? When will those who refuse to obey God be destroyed? When will the temple be handed over to an enemy? And when will some of the Lord ’s people be stomped on?”"
Daniel,8,14,"One of the holy angels said to me, “It will take 2,300 evenings and mornings. Then the temple will be made holy again.”"
Daniel,8,15,I was having the vision. And I was trying to understand it. Then I saw someone who looked like a man.
Daniel,8,16,"I heard a voice from the Ulai Canal. It called out, “Gabriel, tell Daniel what his vision means.”"
Daniel,8,17,"Gabriel came close to where I was standing. I was terrified and fell down flat with my face toward the ground. Here is what he said to me. “Son of man, I want you to understand the vision. It’s about the time of the end.”"
Daniel,8,18,"While he was speaking to me, I was sound asleep. I lay with my face on the ground. Then he touched me. He raised me to my feet."
Daniel,8,19,"He said, “I am going to tell you what will happen later. It will take place when God is angry. The vision is about the appointed time of the end."
Daniel,8,20,You saw a ram that had two horns. It stands for the kings of Media and Persia.
Daniel,8,21,The goat stands for the king of Greece. The large horn between its eyes is the first king.
Daniel,8,22,Four horns took the horn’s place when it was broken off. They stand for four kingdoms that will come from his nation. But those kingdoms will not be as powerful as his.
Daniel,8,23,"“Toward the end of their rule, those who refuse to obey God will become completely evil. Then another king will appear. He will have a scary-looking face. He will be a master at making clever plans."
Daniel,8,24,He will become very strong. But he will not get that way by his own power. People will be amazed at the way he destroys everything. He will be successful no matter what he does. He will destroy mighty people. Those mighty people are God’s holy people.
Daniel,8,25,"He will tell lies in order to succeed. He will think he is more important than anyone else. When people feel safe, he will destroy many of them. He will stand up against the greatest Prince of all. Then he will be destroyed. But he will not be killed by human beings."
Daniel,8,26,“The vision of the evenings and mornings that has been given to you is true. But seal up the vision. It is about a time far off.”
Daniel,8,27,"I, Daniel, was worn out. I was too tired to get up for several days. Then I got up and returned to my work for the king. The vision bewildered me. I couldn’t understand it."
Daniel,9,1,It was the first year that Darius was king of Babylon. He was from Media and was the son of Xerxes.
Daniel,9,2,In that year I learned from the Scriptures that Jerusalem would remain destroyed for 70 years. That was what the Lord had told Jeremiah the prophet.
Daniel,9,3,So I prayed to the Lord God. I begged him. I made many appeals to him. I didn’t eat anything. I put on the rough clothing people wear when they’re sad. And I sat down in ashes.
Daniel,9,4,"I prayed to the Lord my God. I admitted that we had sinned. I said, “Lord, you are a great and wonderful God. You keep the covenant you made with all those who love you and obey your commandments. You show them your love."
Daniel,9,5,We have sinned and done what is wrong. We have been evil. We have refused to obey you. We have turned away from your commands and laws.
Daniel,9,6,"We haven’t listened to your servants the prophets. They spoke in your name to our kings, our princes and our people of long ago. They also brought your message to all our people in the land."
Daniel,9,7,"“Lord, you always do what is right. But we are covered with shame today. We are the people of Judah and Jerusalem. All of us are Israelites, no matter where we live. We are now living in many countries. You scattered us among the nations because we weren’t faithful to you."
Daniel,9,8,"Lord , we are covered with shame. So are our kings and princes, and our people of long ago. We have sinned against you."
Daniel,9,9,You are the Lord our God. You show us your tender love. You forgive us. But we have turned against you.
Daniel,9,10,You are the Lord our God. But we haven’t obeyed you. We haven’t kept the laws you gave us through your servants the prophets.
Daniel,9,11,All the people of Israel have broken your law and turned away from it. They have refused to obey you. “Curses and warnings are written down in the Law of Moses. He was your servant. Those curses have been poured out on us. That’s because we have sinned against you.
Daniel,9,12,The warnings you gave us and our rulers have come true. You have brought great trouble on us. Nothing like what has been done to Jerusalem has ever happened anywhere else on earth.
Daniel,9,13,The curses that are written in the Law of Moses have fallen on us. We have received nothing but trouble. You are the Lord our God. But we haven’t asked for your favor. We haven’t turned away from our sins. We’ve refused to pay attention to the laws you gave us.
Daniel,9,14,"Lord , you didn’t hold back from bringing this trouble on us. You always do what is right. But we haven’t obeyed you."
Daniel,9,15,"“Lord our God, you used your mighty hand to bring your people out of Egypt. You made a name for yourself. It is still great to this day. But we have sinned. We’ve done what is wrong."
Daniel,9,16,"Lord, you saved your people before. So turn your great anger away from Jerusalem again. After all, it is your city. It’s your holy mountain. You have made those who live around us think little of Jerusalem and your people. That’s because we have sinned. Our people before us did evil things too."
Daniel,9,17,"“Our God, hear my prayers. Pay attention to the appeals I make to you. Lord, have mercy on your temple that has been destroyed. Do it for your own honor."
Daniel,9,18,"Our God, please listen to us. The city that belongs to you has been destroyed. Open your eyes and see it. We aren’t asking you to answer our prayers because we are godly. Instead, we’re asking you to do it because you love us so much."
Daniel,9,19,"Lord, please listen! Lord, please forgive us! Lord, hear our prayers! Take action for your own honor. Our God, please don’t wait. Your city and your people belong to you.”"
Daniel,9,20,I was speaking and praying. I was admitting that I and my people Israel had sinned. I was making my appeal to the Lord my God. My appeal was about his holy mountain of Zion.
Daniel,9,21,"While I was still praying, Gabriel came to me. I had seen him in my earlier vision. He flew over to me very quickly. It was about the time when the evening sacrifice is offered."
Daniel,9,22,"He helped me understand. He said, “Daniel, I have come now to help you know and understand these things."
Daniel,9,23,"You are highly respected. So as soon as you began to pray, the Lord gave you a message. I have come to tell you what it is. Here is how you must understand the vision."
Daniel,9,24,"“The Lord has appointed 70 ‘weeks’ for your people and your holy city. During that time, acts against God’s law will be stopped. Sin will come to an end. And the evil things people do will be paid for. Then everyone will always do what is right. Everything that has been made known in visions and prophecies will come true. And the Most Holy Room in the temple will be anointed."
Daniel,9,25,"“Here is what I want you to know and understand. There will be seven ‘weeks.’ Then there will be 62 ‘weeks.’ The seven ‘weeks’ will begin when an order is given to rebuild Jerusalem and make it like new again. At the end of the 62 ‘weeks,’ the Anointed King will come. Jerusalem will have streets and a water system when it is rebuilt. But that will be done in times of trouble."
Daniel,9,26,"After the 62 ‘weeks,’ the Anointed King will be put to death. His followers will desert him. And everything he has will be taken away from him. The army of the ruler who will come will destroy the city and the temple. The end will come like a flood. War will continue until the end. The Lord has ordered that many places be destroyed."
Daniel,9,27,A covenant will be put into effect with many people for one ‘week.’ In the middle of the ‘week’ sacrifices and offerings will come to an end. And at the temple a hated thing that destroys will be set up. It will remain until that ruler who will come is destroyed. Then he will experience what the Lord has ordered.”
Daniel,10,1,"It was the third year that Cyrus, the king of Persia, ruled over Babylon. At that time I was living in Babylon. There the people called me Belteshazzar. A message from God came to me. It was true. It was about a great war. I had a vision that showed me what it meant."
Daniel,10,2,At that time I was very sad for three weeks.
Daniel,10,3,I didn’t eat any rich food. No meat or wine touched my lips. I didn’t use any lotions at all until the three weeks were over.
Daniel,10,4,I was standing on the bank of the great Tigris River. It was the 24th day of the first month.
Daniel,10,5,I looked up and saw a man dressed in linen clothes. He had a belt around his waist. It was made out of fine gold from Uphaz.
Daniel,10,6,His body gleamed like topaz. His face shone like lightning. His eyes were like flaming torches. His arms and legs were as bright as polished bronze. And his voice was like the sound of a large crowd.
Daniel,10,7,I was the only one who saw the vision. The people who were there with me didn’t see it. But they were so terrified that they ran and hid.
Daniel,10,8,So I was left alone as I was watching this great vision. I felt very weak. My face turned as pale as death. And I was helpless.
Daniel,10,9,"Then I heard the man speak. As I listened to him, I fell sound asleep. My face was toward the ground."
Daniel,10,10,A hand touched me. It pulled me up on my hands and knees. I began to tremble with fear.
Daniel,10,11,"The man said, “Daniel, you are highly respected. Think carefully about what I am going to say to you. And stand up. God has sent me to you.” When he said that, I trembled as I stood up."
Daniel,10,12,"He continued, “Do not be afraid, Daniel. You decided to get more understanding. You made yourself humble as you worshiped your God. Since the first day you did those things, your words were heard. I have come to give you an answer."
Daniel,10,13,But the prince of Persia opposed me for 21 days. Then Michael came to help me. He is one of the leaders of the angels. He helped me win the battle over the king of Persia.
Daniel,10,14,Now I have come to explain the vision to you. I will tell you what will happen to your people. The vision shows what will take place in days to come.”
Daniel,10,15,"While he was telling me these things, I bowed with my face toward the ground. I wasn’t able to speak."
Daniel,10,16,"Then someone who looked like a man touched my lips. I opened my mouth. I began to speak to the one who was standing in front of me. I said, “My master, I’m greatly troubled because of the vision I’ve seen. And I feel very weak."
Daniel,10,17,"How can I talk with you? My strength is gone. In fact, I can hardly breathe.”"
Daniel,10,18,The one who looked like a man touched me again. He gave me strength.
Daniel,10,19,"“Do not be afraid,” he said. “You are highly respected. May peace be with you! Be strong now. Be strong.” When he spoke to me, I became stronger. I said, “Speak, my master. You have given me strength.”"
Daniel,10,20,"So he said, “Do you know why I have come to you? Soon I will return to fight against the prince of Persia. When I go, the prince of Greece will come."
Daniel,10,21,But first I will tell you what is written in the Book of Truth. No one gives me any help against those princes except Michael. He is your leader.
Daniel,11,1,"I stepped forward to help him and keep him safe. It was the first year that Darius, the Mede, was king."
Daniel,11,2,"“Now then, what I’m about to tell you is true. Three more kings will come to power in Persia. Then a fourth one will rule. He will be much richer than all the others. He will use his wealth to gain power. And he will stir up everyone against the kingdom of Greece."
Daniel,11,3,"After him, a mighty king will come to power. He will rule with great power and do as he pleases."
Daniel,11,4,"Not long after his rule ends, his kingdom will be broken up. It will be divided up into four parts. His children will not receive it when he dies. And it will not be as strong as his kingdom. It will be pulled up by the roots. And it will be given to others."
Daniel,11,5,“The king of Egypt will become strong. But one of his commanders will become even stronger. He will rule over his own kingdom with great power.
Daniel,11,6,"After many years, the two kingdoms will join forces. The daughter of the next king of Egypt will go to the king of Syria. She will join forces with him. But she will not hold on to her power. And he and his power will not last either. In those days she and her attendants will die. They will die when the people she trusts lie to her. The same thing will happen to her father and the one who helped her."
Daniel,11,7,“Someone from her family line will take her place. He will attack the army of the next king of Syria. Then he will enter his fort. He will fight against that army and win.
Daniel,11,8,He will take the metal statues of their gods. He will also take away their priceless objects of silver and gold. He will carry everything off to Egypt. For many years he will leave the king of Syria alone.
Daniel,11,9,"Then the king of Syria will march into territory that was controlled by Egypt. After that, he will return to his own country."
Daniel,11,10,His sons will prepare for war. They will gather a huge army. It will sweep along like a mighty flood. The army will fight its way as far as one of the Egyptian forts.
Daniel,11,11,"“Another king of Egypt will march out with mighty force. He will be very angry. By then, another person will have become king in Syria. The king of Egypt will come to fight against him. The king of Syria will gather a huge army. But that army will lose the battle."
Daniel,11,12,His soldiers will be carried off. Then the king of Egypt will be filled with pride. He will kill many thousands of soldiers. But his success will not last.
Daniel,11,13,"The king of Syria will bring another army together. It will be larger than the first one. After several years, he will march out with a huge army. It will have everything it needs for battle."
Daniel,11,14,“In those times many people will rise up against the next king of Egypt. Lawless people in your own nation will refuse to obey him. That is what you saw in your vision. But they will not succeed.
Daniel,11,15,Then the king of Syria will go to a certain city that has high walls around it. He will build ramps against them. And he will capture that city. The forces of Egypt will not have the power to stop him. Even their best troops will not be strong enough to stand up against him.
Daniel,11,16,He will do anything he wants to. No one will be able to stand up against him. He will take over the beautiful land of Israel. And he will have the power to destroy it.
Daniel,11,17,The king of Syria will decide to come with the might of his entire kingdom. He will join forces with the king of Egypt. And the king of Syria will give his daughter to him to become his wife. The king of Syria will do this in order to take control of Egypt. But his plans will not succeed or help him.
Daniel,11,18,Then he will turn his attention to the lands along the Mediterranean coast. He will take over many of them. But a commander will put an end to his proud actions. He will turn his pride back on him.
Daniel,11,19,"After this, the king of Syria will return to the forts in his own country. But he will trip and fall. And he will never be seen again."
Daniel,11,20,“The next king after him will send someone out to collect taxes. The taxes will help maintain the glory of his kingdom. But in a few years the king will be destroyed. It will not happen because someone becomes angry with him or kills him in battle.
Daniel,11,21,"“After him, another king will take his place. Many people will hate him. He will not be honored as a king should be. He will lead an army into the kingdom when its people feel secure. He will make clever plans to capture it."
Daniel,11,22,Then he will sweep away a huge army. The army and a prince of the covenant will be destroyed.
Daniel,11,23,The king of Syria will make an agreement with that prince. But then the king of Syria will not keep his word. He will rise to even greater power with the help of only a few people.
Daniel,11,24,"When the people in the richest areas feel secure, he will attack them. He will do what the kings before him could not do. And he will reward his followers with the goods and wealth he takes. He will make clever plans to take over the forts. But that will last for only a short time."
Daniel,11,25,“He will become stronger and more confident. He will do that by gathering a large army. Then he will go to war against the next king of Egypt. That king will fight against him with a huge and very powerful army. But the king of Egypt will not be able to stand up against him. So the plans of the king of Syria will succeed.
Daniel,11,26,The trusted advisers of the king of Egypt will try to destroy him. His army will be swept away. Many of his soldiers will be wounded or killed.
Daniel,11,27,The kings of Syria and Egypt will sit at the same table. But in their hearts they will plan to do what is evil. And they will tell lies to each other. But it will not do them any good. God will put an end to their plans at his appointed time.
Daniel,11,28,The king of Syria will return to his own country. He will go back there with great wealth. But he will make evil plans against the holy temple in Jerusalem. He will do a lot of harm to the temple and the people who worship there. Then he will return to his own country.
Daniel,11,29,"“At God’s appointed time, the king of Syria will march south again. But this time things will turn out differently."
Daniel,11,30,Roman ships will oppose him. He will lose hope. Then he will turn back. He will take out his anger against the holy temple. And he will do good to the Jews who desert it.
Daniel,11,31,“His army will come and make the temple area ‘unclean.’ They will put a stop to the daily sacrifices. Then they will set up a hated thing that destroys.
Daniel,11,32,He will pretend to praise those who have broken the covenant. He will lead them to do what is evil. But the people who know their God will firmly oppose him.
Daniel,11,33,"“Those who are wise will teach many others. But for a while, some of the wise will be killed by swords. Others will be burned to death. Still others will be made prisoners. Or they will be robbed of everything they have."
Daniel,11,34,"When that happens, they will receive a little help. Many who are not honest will join them."
Daniel,11,35,So some of the wise people will suffer. They will be made pure in the fire. They will be made spotless until the time of the end. It will still come at God’s appointed time.
Daniel,11,36,“A certain king will do as he pleases. He will honor himself. He will put himself above every god. He will say things against the greatest God of all. Those things have never been heard before. He will have success until God is not angry anymore. What God has decided to do must take place.
Daniel,11,37,"The king will not show any respect for the gods his people have always worshiped. There is a god desired by women. He will not respect that god either. He will not have respect for any god. Instead, he will put himself above all of them."
Daniel,11,38,"In place of them, he will worship a god of war. He will honor a god his people have not known before. He will give gold and silver to that god. He will bring jewels and expensive gifts to it."
Daniel,11,39,He will attack the strongest forts. A new god will help him do it. He will greatly honor those who recognize him as their leader. He will make them rulers over many people. And he will give them land as a reward.
Daniel,11,40,“A king in the south will go to war against him. It will happen at the time of the end. The king who will honor himself will rush out against him. He will come with chariots and horsemen. He will attack with a lot of ships. He will lead his army into many countries. He will sweep through them like a flood.
Daniel,11,41,"He will also march into the beautiful land of Israel. Many countries will fall. But Edom, Moab and the leaders of Ammon will be saved from his mighty hand."
Daniel,11,42,His power will reach out into many countries. Even Egypt will not escape.
Daniel,11,43,He will gain control of all Egypt’s riches. He will take their gold and silver treasures. The people of Libya and Cush will be under his control.
Daniel,11,44,But reports from the east and the north will terrify him. He will march out with great anger to destroy many people and wipe them out.
Daniel,11,45,He will set up his royal tents. He will put them between the Mediterranean Sea and the beautiful holy mountain of Zion. But his end will come. And no one will help him.
Daniel,12,1,“At that time Michael will appear. He is the great prince of the angels. He guards your people. There will be a time of terrible suffering. Things will be worse than at any time since nations began. But at that time of suffering your people will be saved. Their names are written in the book of life.
Daniel,12,2,Many people who lie dead in their graves will wake up. Some will rise up to life that will never end. Others will rise up to shame that will never end.
Daniel,12,3,Those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the sky. Those who lead many others to do what is right will be like the stars for ever and ever.
Daniel,12,4,"But I want you to roll up this scroll, Daniel. Seal it until the time of the end. Many people will go here and there to increase their knowledge.”"
Daniel,12,5,Then I looked up and saw two other angels. One was on this side of the Tigris River. And one was on the other side.
Daniel,12,6,"The man who was dressed in linen was above the waters of the river. One of the angels spoke to him. He asked, “How long will it be before these amazing things come true?”"
Daniel,12,7,"The man raised both hands toward heaven. I heard him make a promise in the name of the God who lives forever. He answered me, “Three and a half years. Then the power of the holy people will finally be broken. And all these things will come true.”"
Daniel,12,8,"I heard what he said. But I didn’t understand it. So I asked, “My master, what will come of all this?”"
Daniel,12,9,"He answered, “Go on your way, Daniel. The scroll is rolled up. It is sealed until the time of the end."
Daniel,12,10,Many people will be made pure in the fire. They will be made spotless. But sinful people will continue to be evil. Not one sinful person will understand. But those who are wise will.
Daniel,12,11,"“The daily sacrifices will be stopped. And the hated thing that destroys will be set up. After that, there will be 1,290 days."
Daniel,12,12,"Blessed are those who wait for the 1,335 days and reach the end of them."
Daniel,12,13,"“Daniel, go on your way until the end. Your body will rest in the grave. Then at the end of the days you will rise from the dead. And you will receive what God has appointed for you.”"
