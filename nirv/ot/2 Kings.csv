2 Kings,1,1,"After King Ahab died, Moab refused to remain under Israel’s control."
2 Kings,1,2,"Ahaziah had fallen through the window of his upstairs room in Samaria. He had hurt himself. So he sent messengers to ask the god named Baal-Zebub for advice. Baal-Zebub was the god of the city of Ekron. Ahaziah said to the messengers, “Go and ask Baal-Zebub whether I will get well again.”"
2 Kings,1,3,"But the angel of the Lord spoke to Elijah, who was from Tishbe. The angel said, “Go up to see the messengers of Ahaziah, the king of Samaria. Tell them, ‘You are on your way to ask Baal-Zebub for advice. He is the god of Ekron. Are you going there to pray to that god? Do you think there is no God in Israel?’"
2 Kings,1,4,"The Lord says to Ahaziah, ‘You will never leave the bed you are lying on. You can be sure that you will die!’ ” So Elijah went to see the messengers."
2 Kings,1,5,"They returned to the king. He asked them, “Why have you come back?”"
2 Kings,1,6,"“A man met us on our way there,” they replied. “He said to us, ‘Go back to the king who sent you. Tell him, “The Lord says, ‘You are sending messengers to ask Baal-Zebub for advice. He is the god of Ekron. Are you going there to pray to that god? Do you think there is no God in Israel? You will never leave the bed you are lying on. You can be sure that you will die!’ ” ’ ”"
2 Kings,1,7,"The king asked the messengers, “What kind of man came to see you? Who told you these things?”"
2 Kings,1,8,"They replied, “He was wearing clothes made out of hair. He had a leather belt around his waist.” The king said, “That was Elijah from Tishbe.”"
2 Kings,1,9,"Then Ahaziah sent a captain to Elijah. The captain had his group of 50 fighting men with him. Elijah was sitting on top of a hill. The captain went up to him. He said to Elijah, “Man of God, the king says, ‘Come down!’ ”"
2 Kings,1,10,"Elijah answered the captain, “If I’m really a man of God, may fire come down from heaven! May it burn up you and your 50 men!” Then fire came down from heaven. It burned up the captain and his men."
2 Kings,1,11,"After that happened, the king sent another captain to Elijah. The captain had his 50 men with him. He said to Elijah, “Man of God, the king says, ‘Come down at once!’ ”"
2 Kings,1,12,"Elijah replied, “If I’m really a man of God, may fire come down from heaven! May it burn up you and your 50 men!” Then the fire of God came down from heaven. It burned up the captain and his 50 men."
2 Kings,1,13,"So the king sent a third captain with his 50 men. The captain went up to Elijah. He fell on his knees in front of him. “Man of God,” he begged, “please have respect for my life! Please have respect for the lives of these 50 men!"
2 Kings,1,14,Fire has come down from heaven. It has burned up the first two captains and all their men. But please have respect for my life!”
2 Kings,1,15,"The angel of the Lord said to Elijah, “Go down along with him. Don’t be afraid of him.” So Elijah got up and went down to the king with the captain."
2 Kings,1,16,"Elijah told the king, “The Lord says, ‘You have sent messengers to ask Baal-Zebub for advice. He is the god of Ekron. Did you go there to pray to that god for advice? Do you think there is no God in Israel? You will never leave the bed you are lying on. You can be sure that you will die!’ ”"
2 Kings,1,17,"So King Ahaziah died. It happened just as the Lord had said it would. He had spoken that message through Elijah. Ahaziah didn’t have any sons. So Joram, his younger brother, became the next king after him. It was the second year of Jehoram, the king of Judah. Jehoram was the son of Jehoshaphat."
2 Kings,1,18,All the other events of Ahaziah’s rule are written down. Everything he did is written in the official records of the kings of Israel.
2 Kings,2,1,Elijah and Elisha were on their way from Gilgal. The Lord was going to use a strong wind to take Elijah up to heaven.
2 Kings,2,2,"Elijah said to Elisha, “Stay here. The Lord has sent me to Bethel.” But Elisha said, “I won’t leave you. And that’s just as sure as the Lord and you are alive.” So they went down to Bethel."
2 Kings,2,3,"There was a group of prophets at Bethel. They came out to where Elisha was. They asked him, “Do you know what the Lord is going to do? He’s going to take your master away from you today.” “Yes, I know,” Elisha replied. “So be quiet.”"
2 Kings,2,4,"Then Elijah said to him, “Stay here, Elisha. The Lord has sent me to Jericho.” Elisha replied, “I won’t leave you. And that’s just as sure as the Lord and you are alive.” So they went to Jericho."
2 Kings,2,5,"There was a group of prophets at Jericho. They went up to where Elisha was. They asked him, “Do you know what the Lord is going to do? He’s going to take your master away from you today.” “Yes, I know,” Elisha replied. “So be quiet.”"
2 Kings,2,6,"Then Elijah said to him, “Stay here. The Lord has sent me to the Jordan River.” Elisha replied, “I won’t leave you. And that’s just as sure as the Lord and you are alive.” So the two of them walked on."
2 Kings,2,7,Fifty men from the group of prophets followed them. The men stopped and stood not far away from them. They faced the place where Elijah and Elisha had stopped at the Jordan River.
2 Kings,2,8,Elijah rolled up his coat. Then he struck the water with it. The water parted to the right and to the left. The two of them went across the river on dry ground.
2 Kings,2,9,"After they had gone across, Elijah said to Elisha, “Tell me. What can I do for you before I’m taken away from you?” “Please give me a double share of your spirit,” Elisha replied."
2 Kings,2,10,"“You have asked me for something that’s very hard to do,” Elijah said. “But suppose you see me when I’m taken away from you. Then you will receive what you have asked for. If you don’t see me, you won’t receive it.”"
2 Kings,2,11,They kept walking along and talking together. Suddenly there appeared a chariot and horses made of fire. The chariot and horses came between the two men. Then Elijah went up to heaven in a strong wind.
2 Kings,2,12,"Elisha saw it and cried out to Elijah, “My father! You are like a father to me! You, Elijah, are the true chariots and horsemen of Israel!” Elisha didn’t see Elijah anymore. Then Elisha took hold of his own garment and tore it in two."
2 Kings,2,13,He picked up the coat that had fallen from Elijah. He went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan River.
2 Kings,2,14,"Then he struck the water with Elijah’s coat. “Where is the power of the Lord ?” he asked. “Where is the power of the God of Elijah?” When Elisha struck the water, it parted to the right and to the left. He went across the river."
2 Kings,2,15,"The group of prophets from Jericho were watching. They said, “The spirit of Elijah has been given to Elisha.” They went over to Elisha. They bowed down to him with their faces toward the ground."
2 Kings,2,16,"“Look,” they said. “We have 50 capable men. Let them go and look for your master. Perhaps the Spirit of the Lord has lifted him up. Maybe he has put him down on a mountain or in a valley.” “No,” Elisha replied. “Don’t send them.”"
2 Kings,2,17,"But they kept asking until he felt he couldn’t say no. So he said, “Send them.” And they sent 50 men. They looked for Elijah for three days. But they didn’t find him."
2 Kings,2,18,"So they returned to Elisha. He was staying in Jericho. Elisha said to them, “Didn’t I tell you not to go?”"
2 Kings,2,19,"The people of Jericho said to Elisha, “Look. This town has a good location. You can see that for yourself. But the spring of water here is bad. So the land doesn’t produce anything.”"
2 Kings,2,20,"“Bring me a new bowl,” Elisha said. “Put some salt in it.” So they brought it to him."
2 Kings,2,21,"Then he went out to the spring. He threw the salt into it. He told the people, “The Lord says, ‘I have made this water pure. It will never cause death again. It will never keep the land from producing crops again.’ ”"
2 Kings,2,22,The water has stayed pure to this day. That’s what Elisha had said would happen.
2 Kings,2,23,"Elisha left Jericho and went up to Bethel. He was walking along the road. Some boys came out of the town. They made fun of him. “Get out of here, baldy!” they said. “Get out of here! You don’t even have any hair on your head!”"
2 Kings,2,24,He turned around and looked at them. And he asked for bad things to happen to them. He did it in the name of the Lord . Then two bears came out of the woods. They attacked 42 of the boys.
2 Kings,2,25,Elisha went on to Mount Carmel. From there he returned to Samaria.
2 Kings,3,1,Joram became king of Israel in Samaria. It was in the 18th year that Jehoshaphat was king of Judah. Joram ruled for 12 years. He was the son of Ahab.
2 Kings,3,2,Joram did what was evil in the sight of the Lord . But he wasn’t as bad as his father and mother had been. Joram’s father had made a sacred stone used to worship the god named Baal. Joram got rid of it.
2 Kings,3,3,"But he kept on committing the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat. Jeroboam had also caused Israel to commit those same sins. Joram didn’t turn away from them."
2 Kings,3,4,"Mesha raised sheep. He was king of Moab. He had to pay the king of Israel 100,000 lambs a year. He also had to pay him with the wool of 100,000 rams a year."
2 Kings,3,5,"After Ahab died, Moab’s king refused to obey the next king of Israel."
2 Kings,3,6,So at that time King Joram started out from Samaria. He gathered together all of Israel’s troops.
2 Kings,3,7,"He also sent a message to Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah. Joram said, “The king of Moab is refusing to obey me. Will you go with me to fight against Moab?” “Yes. I’ll go with you,” Jehoshaphat replied. “My men will go with you. My horses will also go with you.”"
2 Kings,3,8,"“What road should we take to attack Moab?” Joram asked. “The one that goes through the Desert of Edom,” Jehoshaphat answered."
2 Kings,3,9,So the king of Israel marched out. The king of Judah and the king of Edom went with him. Their armies marched around the southern end of the Dead Sea. After seven days they ran out of water. There wasn’t any water for the men or their animals.
2 Kings,3,10,“What should we do now?” exclaimed the king of Israel. “The Lord has called us three kings together. Did he do it only to hand us over to Moab?”
2 Kings,3,11,"But Jehoshaphat asked, “Isn’t there a prophet of the Lord here? Can’t we ask the Lord for advice through him?” An officer of the king of Israel answered, “Elisha is here. He’s the son of Shaphat. Elisha used to serve Elijah.”"
2 Kings,3,12,"Jehoshaphat said, “The Lord speaks through him.” So the king of Israel went down to see Elisha. Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom also went there."
2 Kings,3,13,"Elisha said to the king of Israel, “Why do you want to come to me? Go to your father’s prophets. Go to your mother’s prophets.” “No,” the king of Israel answered. “The Lord called us three kings together. He did it to hand us over to Moab.”"
2 Kings,3,14,"Elisha said, “I serve the Lord who rules over all. You can be sure that he lives. And you can be just as sure that I have respect for Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah. If I didn’t, I wouldn’t pay any attention to you."
2 Kings,3,15,"But now bring me someone who plays the harp.” While that person was playing the harp, the Lord ’s power came on Elisha."
2 Kings,3,16,"Elisha announced, “The Lord says, ‘I will fill this valley with pools of water.’"
2 Kings,3,17,"This will happen because the Lord says, ‘You will not see wind or rain. But this valley will be filled with water. Then you, your cattle and your other animals will have water to drink.’"
2 Kings,3,18,This is an easy thing for the Lord to do. He will also hand Moab over to you.
2 Kings,3,19,You will destroy every city that has high walls around it. You will destroy every major town. You will cut down every good tree. You will stop up all the springs of water. And you will cover every good field with stones.”
2 Kings,3,20,"The next day, the time came to offer the morning sacrifice. And then it happened! Water was flowing from the direction of Edom! In fact, the land was filled with water!"
2 Kings,3,21,Now all the people of Moab had heard that the kings had come to fight against them. So the king of Moab sent for all Moab’s fighting men. It didn’t matter whether they were young or old. He sent for everyone who could carry a weapon. All of them were stationed at the border.
2 Kings,3,22,"They got up early in the morning. The sun was already shining on the water. Across the way, the water looked red to the men of Moab. It looked like blood."
2 Kings,3,23,"“That’s blood!” they said. “Those kings must have fought and killed each other. Let’s go, Moab! Let’s take everything that has any value.”"
2 Kings,3,24,"So the men of Moab went to the camp of Israel. Just as they arrived there, the men of Israel got ready to fight. They fought against the men of Moab until those men ran away. The men of Israel marched into the land and attacked it. They killed the people of Moab."
2 Kings,3,25,They destroyed the towns. Each man threw a large stone on every good field. They did that until the fields were covered. They stopped up all the springs of water. And they cut down every good tree. The only town left with any stones in place was Kir Hareseth. But some of the Israelites armed with slings surrounded it. Then they attacked it.
2 Kings,3,26,The king of Moab saw that the battle had gone against him. So he took with him 700 men who had swords. They tried to break through the battle lines to the king of Edom. But they couldn’t do it.
2 Kings,3,27,Then the king of Moab took his oldest son. He was the son who would become the next king of Moab. But the king offered his son as a sacrifice on the city wall. That shocked and terrified the men of Israel. So they pulled back and returned to their own land.
2 Kings,4,1,"The wife of a man from the group of the prophets cried out to Elisha. She said, “My husband is dead. You know how much respect he had for the Lord . But he owed money to someone. And now that person is coming to take my two boys away. They will become his slaves.”"
2 Kings,4,2,"Elisha replied to her, “How can I help you? Tell me. What do you have in your house?” “I don’t have anything there at all,” she said. “All I have is a small jar of olive oil.”"
2 Kings,4,3,"Elisha said, “Go around to all your neighbors. Ask them for empty jars. Get as many as you can."
2 Kings,4,4,"Then go inside your house. Shut the door behind you and your sons. Pour oil into all the jars. As each jar is filled, put it over to one side.”"
2 Kings,4,5,The woman left him. Then she shut the door behind her and her sons. They brought the jars to her. And she kept pouring.
2 Kings,4,6,"When all the jars were full, she spoke to one of her sons. She said, “Bring me another jar.” But he replied, “There aren’t any more left.” Then the oil stopped flowing."
2 Kings,4,7,"She went and told the man of God about it. He said, “Go and sell the oil. Pay what you owe. You and your sons can live on what is left.”"
2 Kings,4,8,"One day Elisha went to the town of Shunem. A rich woman lived there. She begged him to stay and have a meal. So every time he came by, he stopped there to eat."
2 Kings,4,9,"The woman said to her husband, “That man often comes by here. I know that he is a holy man of God."
2 Kings,4,10,Let’s make a small room for him on the roof. We’ll put a bed and a table in it. We’ll also put a chair and a lamp in it. Then he can stay there when he comes to visit us.”
2 Kings,4,11,One day Elisha came. He went up to his room and lay down there.
2 Kings,4,12,"He said to his servant Gehazi, “Go and get the woman from Shunem.” So he did. She stood in front of Elisha."
2 Kings,4,13,"He said to Gehazi, “Tell her, ‘You have gone to a lot of trouble for us. Now what can we do for you? Can we speak to the king for you? Or can we speak to the commander of the army for you?’ ” She replied, “I live among my own people. I have everything I need here.”"
2 Kings,4,14,"After she left, Elisha asked Gehazi, “What can we do for her?” Gehazi said, “She doesn’t have a son. And her husband is old.”"
2 Kings,4,15,"Then Elisha said, “Bring her here again.” So he did. She stood in the doorway."
2 Kings,4,16,"“You will hold a son in your arms,” Elisha said. “It will be about this time next year.” “No, my master!” she objected. “You are a man of God. So please don’t lie to me!”"
2 Kings,4,17,But the woman became pregnant. She had a baby boy. It happened the next year about that same time. That’s exactly what Elisha had told her would happen.
2 Kings,4,18,The child grew. One day he went out to get his father. His father was with the people who were gathering the crops.
2 Kings,4,19,"The boy said to his father, “My head hurts! It really hurts!” His father told a servant, “Carry him to his mother.”"
2 Kings,4,20,The servant lifted up the boy. He carried him to his mother. The boy sat on her lap until noon. Then he died.
2 Kings,4,21,She went up to the room on the roof. There she laid him on the bed of the man of God. Then she shut the door and went out.
2 Kings,4,22,"She sent for her husband. She said, “Please send me one of the servants and a donkey. Then I can go quickly to the man of God and return.”"
2 Kings,4,23,"“Why do you want to go to him today?” he asked. “It isn’t the time for the New Moon feast. It isn’t the Sabbath day.” “Don’t let that bother you,” she said."
2 Kings,4,24,"She put a saddle on her donkey. She said to her servant, “Let’s go. Don’t slow down for me unless I tell you to.”"
2 Kings,4,25,"So she started out. She came to Mount Carmel. That’s where the man of God was. When she was still a long way off, he saw her coming. He said to his servant Gehazi, “Look! There’s the woman from Shunem!"
2 Kings,4,26,"Run out there to meet her. Ask her, ‘Are you all right? Is your husband all right? Is your child all right?’ ” “Everything is all right,” she said."
2 Kings,4,27,"She came to the man of God at the mountain. Then she took hold of his feet. Gehazi came over to push her away. But the man of God said, “Leave her alone! She is suffering terribly. But the Lord hasn’t told me the reason for it. He has hidden it from me.”"
2 Kings,4,28,"“My master, did I ask you for a son?” she said. “Didn’t I tell you, ‘Don’t make me hope for something that won’t happen’?”"
2 Kings,4,29,"Elisha said to Gehazi, “Tuck your coat into your belt. Take my walking stick and run to Shunem. Don’t say hello to anyone you see. If anyone says hello to you, don’t answer. Lay my walking stick on the boy’s face.”"
2 Kings,4,30,"But the child’s mother said, “I won’t leave you. And that’s just as sure as the Lord and you are alive.” So Elisha got up and followed her."
2 Kings,4,31,"Gehazi went on ahead. He laid Elisha’s walking stick on the boy’s face. But there wasn’t any sound. The boy didn’t move at all. So Gehazi went back to Elisha. He told him, “The boy hasn’t awakened.”"
2 Kings,4,32,Elisha arrived at the house. The boy was dead. He was lying on Elisha’s bed.
2 Kings,4,33,Elisha went into the room. He shut the door. He was alone with the boy. He prayed to the Lord.
2 Kings,4,34,"Then Elisha got on the bed. He lay down on the boy. His mouth touched the boy’s mouth. His eyes touched the boy’s eyes. And his hands touched the boy’s hands. As Elisha lay on the boy, the boy’s body grew warm."
2 Kings,4,35,"Elisha turned away. He walked back and forth in the room. Then he got on the bed again. He lay down on the boy once more. The boy sneezed seven times. After that, he opened his eyes."
2 Kings,4,36,"Elisha sent for Gehazi. He said to him, “Go and get the woman from Shunem.” So he did. When she came, Elisha said, “Take your son.”"
2 Kings,4,37,She came in and fell at Elisha’s feet. She bowed down with her face toward the ground. Then she took her son and went out.
2 Kings,4,38,"Elisha returned to Gilgal. There wasn’t enough food to eat in that area. The group of the prophets was meeting with Elisha. So he said to his servant, “Put the large pot over the fire. Cook some stew for these prophets.”"
2 Kings,4,39,One of them went out into the fields to gather herbs. He found a wild vine and picked some of its gourds. He picked as many as he could fit in his coat. Then he cut them up and put them into the pot of stew. But no one knew what they were.
2 Kings,4,40,"The stew was poured out for the men. They began to eat it. But then they cried out, “Man of God, the food in that pot will kill us!” They couldn’t eat it."
2 Kings,4,41,"Elisha said, “Get some flour.” He put it in the pot. He said, “Serve it to the men to eat.” Then there wasn’t anything in the pot that could harm them."
2 Kings,4,42,"A man came from Baal Shalishah. He brought the man of God 20 loaves of barley bread. They had been baked from the first grain that had ripened. The man also brought some heads of new grain. “Give this food to the people to eat,” Elisha said."
2 Kings,4,43,"“How can I put this in front of 100 men?” his servant asked. But Elisha answered, “Give it to the people to eat. Do it because the Lord says, ‘They will eat and have some left over.’ ”"
2 Kings,4,44,Then the servant put the food in front of them. They ate it and had some left over. It happened just as the Lord had said it would.
2 Kings,5,1,Naaman was army commander of the king of Aram. He was very important to his master and was highly respected. That’s because the Lord had helped him win the battle over Aram’s enemies. He was a brave soldier. But he had a skin disease.
2 Kings,5,2,Groups of soldiers from Aram had marched out. They had captured a young girl from Israel. She became a servant of Naaman’s wife.
2 Kings,5,3,"The young girl spoke to the woman she was serving. She said, “I wish my master would go and see the prophet who is in Samaria. He would heal my master of his skin disease.”"
2 Kings,5,4,Naaman went to see his own master. He told him what the girl from Israel had said.
2 Kings,5,5,"“I think you should go,” the king of Aram replied. “I’ll give you a letter to take to the king of Israel.” So Naaman left. He took 750 pounds of silver with him. He also took 150 pounds of gold. And he took ten sets of clothes."
2 Kings,5,6,"He carried the letter to the king of Israel. It said, “I’m sending my servant Naaman to you with this letter. I want you to heal him of his skin disease.”"
2 Kings,5,7,"The king of Israel read the letter. As soon as he did, he tore his royal robes. He said, “Am I God? Can I kill people and bring them back to life? Why does this fellow send someone to me to be healed of his skin disease? He must be trying to pick a fight with me!”"
2 Kings,5,8,"Elisha, the man of God, heard that the king of Israel had torn his robes. So he sent the king a message. Elisha said, “Why have you torn your robes? Tell the man to come to me. Then he will know there is a prophet in Israel.”"
2 Kings,5,9,So Naaman went to see Elisha. He took his horses and chariots with him. He stopped at the door of Elisha’s house.
2 Kings,5,10,"Elisha sent a messenger out to him. The messenger said, “Go! Wash yourself in the Jordan River seven times. Then your skin will be healed. You will be pure and ‘clean’ again.”"
2 Kings,5,11,"But Naaman went away angry. He said, “I was sure Elisha would come out to me. I thought he would stand there and pray to the Lord his God. I thought he would wave his hand over my skin. Then I would be healed."
2 Kings,5,12,And what about the Abana and Pharpar rivers of Damascus? Aren’t they better than all the rivers of Israel? Couldn’t I wash in the rivers of Damascus and be made pure and ‘clean’?” So he turned and went away. He was very angry.
2 Kings,5,13,"Naaman’s servants went over to him. They said, “You are like a father to us. What if Elisha the prophet had told you to do some great thing? Wouldn’t you have done it? But he only said, ‘Wash yourself. Then you will be pure and “clean.” ’ You should be even more willing to do that!”"
2 Kings,5,14,So Naaman went down to the Jordan River. He dipped himself in it seven times. He did exactly what the man of God had told him to do. Then his skin was made pure again. It became “clean” like the skin of a young boy.
2 Kings,5,15,"Naaman and all his attendants went back to the man of God. Naaman stood in front of Elisha. Naaman said, “Now I know that there is no God anywhere in the whole world except in Israel. So please accept a gift from me.”"
2 Kings,5,16,"The prophet answered, “I serve the Lord . You can be sure that he lives. And you can be just as sure that I won’t accept a gift from you.” Even though Naaman begged him to take it, Elisha wouldn’t."
2 Kings,5,17,"“I can see that you won’t accept a gift from me,” said Naaman. “But please let me have some soil from your land. Give me as much as a pair of mules can carry. Here’s why I want it. I won’t ever bring burnt offerings and sacrifices to any other god again. I’ll bring them only to the Lord . I’ll worship him on his own soil."
2 Kings,5,18,"But there is one thing I hope the Lord will forgive me for. From time to time my master will enter the temple to bow down to his god Rimmon. When he does, he’ll lean on my arm. Then I’ll have to bow down there also. I hope the Lord will forgive me for that.”"
2 Kings,5,19,"“Go in peace,” Elisha said. Naaman started out on his way."
2 Kings,5,20,"Gehazi was the servant of Elisha, the man of God. Gehazi said to himself, “My master was too easy on Naaman from Aram. He should have accepted the gift Naaman brought. I’m going to run after him. I’m going to get something from him. And that’s just as sure as the Lord is alive.”"
2 Kings,5,21,Gehazi hurried after Naaman. Naaman saw him running toward him. So he got down from the chariot to greet him. “Is everything all right?” he asked.
2 Kings,5,22,"“Everything is all right,” Gehazi answered. “My master sent me to say, ‘Two young men from the group of the prophets have just come to me. They’ve come from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them 75 pounds of silver and two sets of clothes.’ ”"
2 Kings,5,23,"“I wish you would take twice as much silver,” said Naaman. He begged Gehazi to accept it. Then Naaman tied up 150 pounds of silver in two bags. He also gave Gehazi two sets of clothes. He gave all of it to two of his own servants. They carried it ahead of Gehazi."
2 Kings,5,24,"Gehazi came to the hill where Elisha lived. Then the servants handed the things over to Gehazi. He put them away in Elisha’s house. He sent the men away, and they left."
2 Kings,5,25,"Then he went back inside the house. He stood in front of his master Elisha. “Gehazi, where have you been?” Elisha asked. “I didn’t go anywhere,” Gehazi answered."
2 Kings,5,26,"But Elisha said to him, “Didn’t my spirit go with you? I know that the man got down from his chariot to greet you. Is this the time for you to accept money or clothes? Is it the time to take olive groves, vineyards, flocks or herds? Is it the time to accept male and female slaves?"
2 Kings,5,27,You and your children after you will have Naaman’s skin disease forever.” Then Gehazi left Elisha. And he had Naaman’s skin disease. His skin had become as white as snow.
2 Kings,6,1,"The group of the prophets said to Elisha, “Look. The place where we meet with you is too small for us."
2 Kings,6,2,"We would like to go to the Jordan River. Each of us can get some wood there. We want to build a place there for us to meet.” Elisha said, “Go.”"
2 Kings,6,3,"Then one of them said, “Won’t you please come with us?” “I will,” Elisha replied."
2 Kings,6,4,And he went with them. They went to the Jordan River. There they began to cut down trees.
2 Kings,6,5,"One of them was cutting down a tree. The iron blade of his ax fell into the water. “Oh no, master!” he cried out. “This ax was borrowed!”"
2 Kings,6,6,"The man of God asked, “Where did the blade fall?” He showed Elisha the place. Then Elisha cut a stick and threw it there. That made the iron blade float."
2 Kings,6,7,"“Take it out of the water,” he said. So the man reached out and took it."
2 Kings,6,8,"The king of Aram was at war with Israel. He talked things over with his officers. Then he said, “I’m going to set up my camp in a certain place.”"
2 Kings,6,9,"Elisha, the man of God, sent a message to the king of Israel. Elisha said, “Try to stay away from that place. Aram’s army is going to be down there.”"
2 Kings,6,10,The king of Israel checked on the place the man of God had told him about. Time after time Elisha warned the king. So the king was on guard in those places.
2 Kings,6,11,"All of that made the king of Aram very angry. He sent for his officers. He said to them, “Tell me! Which of us is on the side of the king of Israel?”"
2 Kings,6,12,"“You are my king and master,” said one of his officers. “None of us is on Israel’s side. But Elisha is a prophet in Israel. He tells the king of Israel even the words you speak in your own bedroom.”"
2 Kings,6,13,"“Go and find out where he is,” the king ordered. “Then I can send my men and capture him.” The report came back. The officers said, “He’s in Dothan.”"
2 Kings,6,14,Then the king sent horses and chariots and a strong army there. They went at night and surrounded the city.
2 Kings,6,15,"The servant of the man of God got up the next morning. He went out early. He saw that an army with horses and chariots had surrounded the city. “Oh no, my master!” the servant said. “What can we do?”"
2 Kings,6,16,"“Don’t be afraid,” the prophet answered. “Those who are with us are more than those who are with them.”"
2 Kings,6,17,"Elisha prayed, “ Lord , open my servant’s eyes so that he can see.” Then the Lord opened his eyes. Elisha’s servant looked up and saw the hills. He saw that Elisha was surrounded by horses and chariots made of fire."
2 Kings,6,18,"Aram’s army came down toward Elisha. Then he prayed to the Lord , “Make these soldiers blind.” So the Lord made them blind, just as Elisha had prayed."
2 Kings,6,19,"Elisha told them, “This isn’t the right road. This isn’t the right city. Follow me. I’ll lead you to the man you are looking for.” He led them to Samaria."
2 Kings,6,20,"They entered the city. Then Elisha said, “ Lord , open the eyes of these men. Help them see again.” Then the Lord opened their eyes. They looked around. And there they were, inside Samaria!"
2 Kings,6,21,"The king of Israel saw them. So he asked Elisha, “Should I kill them? I need your advice. You are like a father to me. Should I kill them?”"
2 Kings,6,22,"“Don’t kill them,” he answered. “Would you kill people you have captured with your own sword or bow? Put some food and water in front of them. Then they can eat and drink. They can go back to their master.”"
2 Kings,6,23,"So the king of Israel prepared a great feast for them. After they had finished eating and drinking, he sent them away. They returned to their master. So the groups of fighting men from Aram stopped attacking Israel’s territory."
2 Kings,6,24,"Some time later, Ben-Hadad gathered his entire army together. Ben-Hadad was the king of Aram. His army marched up and surrounded Samaria. Then they attacked it."
2 Kings,6,25,There wasn’t enough food anywhere in the city. It was surrounded for so long that people had to weigh out two pounds of silver for a donkey’s head. They had to weigh out two ounces of silver for half a pint of seed pods.
2 Kings,6,26,"One day the king of Israel was walking on top of the city wall. A woman cried out to him, “You are my king and master. Please help me!”"
2 Kings,6,27,"The king replied, “If the Lord doesn’t help you, where can I get help for you? From the threshing floor? From the winepress?”"
2 Kings,6,28,"He continued, “What’s wrong?” She answered, “A woman said to me, ‘Give up your son. Then we can eat him today. Tomorrow we’ll eat my son.’"
2 Kings,6,29,"So we cooked my son. Then we ate him. The next day I said to her, ‘Give up your son. Then we can eat him.’ But she had hidden him.”"
2 Kings,6,30,"When the king heard the woman’s words, he tore his royal robes. As he walked along the wall, the people looked up at him. They saw that under his robes he was wearing the rough clothing people wear when they’re sad."
2 Kings,6,31,"He said, “I’ll cut the head of Shaphat’s son Elisha off his shoulders today. If I don’t, may God punish me greatly!”"
2 Kings,6,32,"Elisha was sitting in his house. The elders were sitting there with him. The king went to see Elisha. He sent a messenger on ahead of him. Before the messenger arrived, Elisha spoke to the elders. He said, “That murderer is sending someone here to cut off my head. Can’t you see that? When the messenger comes, close the door. Hold it shut against him. Can’t you hear his master’s footsteps right behind him?”"
2 Kings,6,33,"Elisha was still talking to the elders when the messenger came down to him. The king also arrived. He said, “The Lord has sent this horrible trouble on us. Why should I wait any longer for him to help us?”"
2 Kings,7,1,"Elisha replied, “Listen to a message from the Lord . He says, ‘About this time tomorrow, flour won’t cost very much. Even 12 pounds of the finest flour will cost less than half of an ounce of silver. You will also be able to buy 20 pounds of barley for the same price. That’s all you will have to pay for those things at the gate of Samaria.’ ”"
2 Kings,7,2,"The king was leaning on an officer’s arm. The officer spoke to the man of God. The officer said, “Suppose the Lord opens the sky and pours down food on us. Even if he does, could what you are saying really happen?” “You will see it with your own eyes,” answered Elisha. “But you won’t eat any of it!”"
2 Kings,7,3,"There were four men who had a skin disease. They were at the entrance of the gate of Samaria. They said to one another, “Why should we stay here until we die?"
2 Kings,7,4,"Suppose we say, ‘We’ll go into the city.’ There isn’t any food there, and we’ll die. But if we stay here, we’ll die anyway. So let’s go over to Aram’s army camp. Let’s give ourselves up. If they spare us, we’ll live. If they kill us, we’ll die.”"
2 Kings,7,5,At sunset they got up and went to Aram’s army camp. They arrived at the edge of it. But no one was there.
2 Kings,7,6,"The Lord had caused the soldiers of Aram to hear a noise. It sounded like chariots and horses and a huge army. So the soldiers said to one another, “Listen! The king of Israel has hired the Hittite and Egyptian kings. He has paid them to attack us!”"
2 Kings,7,7,So the soldiers of Aram had run away at sunset. They had left their tents and horses and donkeys behind. They had left the camp just as it was. And they had run for their lives.
2 Kings,7,8,"The men who had a skin disease arrived at the edge of the camp. They entered one of the tents. They ate and drank. Then they took silver, gold and clothes. They went off and hid them. They returned and entered another tent. They took some things from it and hid them also."
2 Kings,7,9,"But then they said to one another, “What we’re doing isn’t right. This is a day of good news. And we’re keeping it to ourselves. If we wait until sunrise, we’ll be punished. Let’s go at once. Let’s report this to the royal palace.”"
2 Kings,7,10,"So they went. They called out to the people who were guarding the city gates. They told them, “We went into Aram’s army camp. No one was there. We didn’t hear anyone. The horses and donkeys were still tied up. The tents were left just as they were.”"
2 Kings,7,11,The people who guarded the gates shouted the news. It was reported inside the palace.
2 Kings,7,12,"The king of Israel got up in the night. He spoke to his officers. He said, “I’ll tell you what the men of Aram have done to us. They know we are very hungry. So they have left the camp to hide in the countryside. They are thinking, ‘We are sure they’ll come out. Then we’ll take them alive. And we’ll get into the city.’ ”"
2 Kings,7,13,"One of the king’s officers said, “A few horses are still left in the city. Have some men get five of them. Those men won’t be any worse off than all the other Israelites who are left here. In fact, all of us will soon be dead anyway. So let’s send the men to find out what happened.”"
2 Kings,7,14,"The men chose two chariots and their horses. The king sent them out to look for Aram’s army. He commanded the drivers, “Go and find out what has happened.”"
2 Kings,7,15,They followed the trail of Aram’s soldiers all the way to the Jordan River. They found clothes and supplies all along the road. The soldiers had thrown them down when they ran away. So the men who were sent out returned. They reported to the king what they had seen.
2 Kings,7,16,Then the people went out of the city. They took everything of value from Aram’s army camp. So 12 pounds of the finest flour sold for less than half of an ounce of silver. And 20 pounds of barley sold for the same price. That’s exactly what the Lord had said would happen.
2 Kings,7,17,"The king had put an officer in charge of the city gate. He was the officer on whose arm the king leaned. On their way out of the city, the people knocked the officer down. In the entrance of the gate he was crushed as they walked on top of him. And so he died. That’s exactly what the man of God had said would happen. He had said it when the king came down to his house."
2 Kings,7,18,"What Elisha, the man of God, had told the king came true. Elisha had said, “About this time tomorrow, flour won’t cost very much. Even 12 pounds of the finest flour will cost less than half of an ounce of silver. You will also be able to buy 20 pounds of barley for the same price. That’s all you will have to pay for those things at the gate of Samaria.”"
2 Kings,7,19,"The officer had spoken to the man of God. The officer had said, “Suppose the Lord opens the sky and pours down food on us. Even if he does, could what you are saying really happen?” The man of God had replied, “You will see it with your own eyes. But you won’t eat any of it!”"
2 Kings,7,20,"And that’s exactly what happened to the officer. On their way out of the city, the people knocked him down. In the entrance of the gate he was crushed as they walked on top of him. And so he died."
2 Kings,8,1,"Elisha had brought a woman’s son back to life. He had said to her, “Go away with your family. Stay for a while anywhere you can. The Lord has decided that there won’t be enough food in the land. That will be true for seven years.”"
2 Kings,8,2,The woman did just as the man of God told her to. She and her family went away. They stayed in the land of the Philistines for seven years.
2 Kings,8,3,The seven years passed. Then she came back from the land of the Philistines. She went to the king of Israel. She wanted to ask him to get her house and land back.
2 Kings,8,4,"The king was talking to Gehazi. Gehazi was the servant of the man of God. The king had said, “Tell me about all the great things Elisha has done.”"
2 Kings,8,5,"Gehazi was telling the king how Elisha had brought a dead boy back to life. Just then the woman came to ask the king to get her house and land back. She was the woman whose son Elisha had brought back to life. Gehazi said, “King Joram, this is the woman I’ve been telling you about. And this is her son. He’s the one Elisha brought back to life.”"
2 Kings,8,6,"The king asked the woman about her house and land. And she told him. Then he appointed an official to look into her case. The king told him, “Give her back everything that belonged to her. That includes all the money that was earned from her land. It was earned from the day she left the country until now.”"
2 Kings,8,7,"Elisha went to Damascus. Ben-Hadad was sick. He was king of Aram. The king was told, “The man of God has come all the way up here.”"
2 Kings,8,8,"Then the king said to Hazael, “Take a gift with you. Go and see the man of God. Ask him for the Lord ’s advice. Ask him whether I will get well again.”"
2 Kings,8,9,"Hazael went to see Elisha. Hazael took 40 camels with him as a gift. The camels were loaded with all the finest goods of Damascus. Hazael went into Elisha’s house and stood in front of him. Hazael said, “Ben-Hadad has sent me. He is the king of Aram. He asks, ‘Will I get well again?’ ”"
2 Kings,8,10,"Elisha answered, “Go and tell him, ‘Yes. You will get well again.’ But the Lord has shown me that he will in fact die.”"
2 Kings,8,11,Elisha stared at him without looking away. He did it until Hazael felt uncomfortable. Then the man of God began to weep.
2 Kings,8,12,"“Why are you weeping?” asked Hazael. “Because I know how much harm you will do to the people of Israel,” Elisha answered. “You will set fire to their cities that have high walls around them. You will kill their young men with your swords. You will smash their little children on the ground. You will rip open their pregnant women.”"
2 Kings,8,13,"Hazael said, “How could I possibly do a thing like that? I’m nothing but a dog. I don’t have that kind of power.” “You will become king of Aram,” Elisha answered. “That’s what the Lord has shown me.”"
2 Kings,8,14,"Then Hazael left Elisha and returned to his master. Ben-Hadad asked, “What did Elisha say to you?” Hazael replied, “He told me you would get well again.”"
2 Kings,8,15,But the next day Hazael got a thick cloth. He soaked it in water. He spread it over the king’s face. He held it there until the king died. Then Hazael became the next king after him.
2 Kings,8,16,Jehoram began to rule as king over Judah. It was in the fifth year that Joram was king of Israel. Joram was the son of Ahab. Jehoram was the son of Jehoshaphat.
2 Kings,8,17,Jehoram was 32 years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for eight years.
2 Kings,8,18,"He followed the ways of the kings of Israel, just as the royal family of Ahab had done. In fact, he married a daughter of Ahab. Jehoram did what was evil in the sight of the Lord."
2 Kings,8,19,But the Lord didn’t want to destroy Judah. That’s because the Lord had made a covenant with his servant David. The Lord had promised to keep the lamp of David’s kingdom burning brightly. The Lord had promised that for him and his children after him forever.
2 Kings,8,20,"When Jehoram was king over Judah, Edom refused to remain under Judah’s control. Edom set up their own king."
2 Kings,8,21,So Jehoram went to Zair. He took all his chariots with him. The men of Edom surrounded him and his chariot commanders. He got up at night and fought his way out. But his army ran back home.
2 Kings,8,22,"To this day Edom has refused to remain under Judah’s control. When Jehoram was Judah’s king, Libnah also refused to remain under the control of Judah."
2 Kings,8,23,The other events of Jehoram’s rule are written down. Everything he did is written in the official records of the kings of Judah.
2 Kings,8,24,Jehoram joined the members of his family who had already died. He was buried in the family tomb in the City of David. Jehoram’s son Ahaziah became the next king after him.
2 Kings,8,25,Ahaziah began to rule as king over Judah. It was in the 12th year that Joram was king of Israel. Joram was the son of Ahab. Ahaziah was the son of Jehoram.
2 Kings,8,26,Ahaziah was 22 years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for one year. His mother’s name was Athaliah. She was a granddaughter of Omri. Omri had been the king of Israel.
2 Kings,8,27,"Ahaziah followed the ways of the royal family of Ahab. Ahaziah did what was evil in the sight of the Lord , just as the family of Ahab had done. That’s because he had married into Ahab’s family."
2 Kings,8,28,Ahaziah joined forces with Joram. They went to war against Hazael at Ramoth Gilead. Joram was the son of Ahab. Hazael was king of Aram. The soldiers of Aram wounded King Joram.
2 Kings,8,29,"So he returned to Jezreel to give his wounds time to heal. The soldiers of Aram had wounded him at Ramoth in his battle against Hazael, the king of Aram. Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram, went down to Jezreel. He went there to see Joram. That’s because Joram had been wounded. Ahaziah was king of Judah. Joram was the son of Ahab."
2 Kings,9,1,"Elisha the prophet sent for a man from the group of the prophets. Elisha said to him, “Tuck your coat into your belt. Take this bottle of olive oil with you. Go to Ramoth Gilead."
2 Kings,9,2,"When you get there, look for Jehu. He’s the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi. Go to Jehu. Get him away from his companions. Take him into an inside room."
2 Kings,9,3,"Then get the bottle. Pour the oil on his head. Announce to him, ‘The Lord says, “I anoint you as king over Israel.” ’ After that, open the door and run away. Do it quickly!”"
2 Kings,9,4,So the young prophet went to Ramoth Gilead.
2 Kings,9,5,"When he arrived, he found the army officers sitting together. “Commander, I have a message for you,” he said. “For which one of us?” asked Jehu. “For you, commander,” he replied."
2 Kings,9,6,"Jehu got up and went into the house. Then the prophet poured the oil on Jehu’s head. He announced, “The Lord is the God of Israel. He says, ‘I am anointing you as king over the Lord ’s people Israel."
2 Kings,9,7,You must destroy the royal house of your master Ahab. I will pay them back for spilling the blood of my servants the prophets. I will also pay them back for the blood of all the Lord ’s servants that Jezebel spilled.
2 Kings,9,8,The whole house of Ahab will die out. I will destroy every male in Israel who is related to Ahab. It does not matter whether they are slaves or free.
2 Kings,9,9,"I will make Ahab’s royal house like the house of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat. I will make it like the house of Baasha, the son of Ahijah."
2 Kings,9,10,Dogs will eat up Jezebel on a piece of land at Jezreel. No one will bury her.’ ” Then the prophet opened the door and ran away.
2 Kings,9,11,"Jehu went out to where the other officers were. One of them asked him, “Is everything all right? Why did that crazy man come to you?” “You know the man. You know the kinds of things he says,” Jehu replied."
2 Kings,9,12,"“That’s not true!” they said. “Tell us.” Jehu said, “Here is what he told me. He announced, ‘The Lord says, “I am anointing you as king over Israel.” ’ ”"
2 Kings,9,13,"The officers quickly grabbed their coats. They spread them out under Jehu on the bare steps of the house. Then they blew a trumpet. They shouted, “Jehu is king!”"
2 Kings,9,14,"Jehu was the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi. Jehu made plans against Joram. During that time Joram and Israel’s whole army had been guarding Ramoth Gilead. They had been guarding it against Hazael, the king of Aram."
2 Kings,9,15,"But King Joram had returned to Jezreel. He had gone there to give his wounds time to heal. The soldiers of Aram had wounded him in his battle against Hazael, the king of Aram. Jehu said to his men, “Do you want to make me king? If you do, don’t let anyone sneak out of the city. Don’t let them go and tell the news in Jezreel.”"
2 Kings,9,16,"Then Jehu got into his chariot. He rode off to Jezreel. Joram was resting there. And Ahaziah, the king of Judah, had gone down to see him."
2 Kings,9,17,"A lookout was standing on the roof of the tower in Jezreel. He saw Jehu’s troops approaching. So he called out, “I see some troops coming.” “Get a horseman,” Joram ordered. “Send him to ride out to them. Have him ask, ‘Are you coming in peace?’ ”"
2 Kings,9,18,"The horseman rode out to where Jehu was. He said, “The king asks, ‘Are you coming in peace?’ ” “What do you know about peace?” Jehu answered. “Get in line behind me.” The lookout reported, “The messenger has reached them. But he isn’t coming back.”"
2 Kings,9,19,"So the king sent out a second horseman. When he came to them, he said, “The king asks, ‘Are you coming in peace?’ ” Jehu replied, “What do you know about peace? Get in line behind me.”"
2 Kings,9,20,"The lookout reported, “The second messenger has reached them. But he isn’t coming back either. The one driving the chariot drives like Jehu, the son of Nimshi. He’s driving like a crazy person.”"
2 Kings,9,21,"“Get my chariot ready,” King Joram ordered. When it was ready, he rode out. Ahaziah, the king of Judah, rode out with him. Each of them was in his own chariot. They both went to meet Jehu. They met him at the piece of land that had belonged to Naboth from Jezreel."
2 Kings,9,22,"When Joram saw Jehu he asked, “Have you come here in peace, Jehu?” “Your mother Jezebel worships statues of gods,” Jehu replied. “She also worships evil powers. The evil things she does have spread everywhere. As long as all of that goes on, how can there be peace?”"
2 Kings,9,23,"Joram turned around and tried to get away. He called out, “It’s treason, Ahaziah!”"
2 Kings,9,24,Then Jehu shot an arrow at Joram. It hit him between the shoulders. It went through his heart. He sank down slowly in his chariot.
2 Kings,9,25,"Jehu spoke to Bidkar, his chariot officer. Jehu said, “Pick Joram up. Throw him on the field that belonged to Naboth from Jezreel. Remember how you and I were riding together in chariots behind Joram’s father Ahab? It was when the Lord spoke this prophecy against him. The Lord announced,"
2 Kings,9,26,‘Yesterday I saw the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons. You can be sure that I will make you pay for it on this piece of land.’ So pick Joram up. Throw him on that piece of land. That’s what the Lord said would happen.”
2 Kings,9,27,"Ahaziah, the king of Judah, saw what had happened. So he tried to get away. He went up the road toward Beth Haggan. Jehu chased him. He shouted, “Kill him too!” Jehu’s men wounded Ahaziah in his chariot. It happened on the way up to Gur near Ibleam. But Ahaziah escaped to Megiddo. And that’s where he died."
2 Kings,9,28,Ahaziah’s servants took him to Jerusalem in his chariot. They buried him in his family tomb in the City of David.
2 Kings,9,29,"Ahaziah had become king of Judah. It was in the 11th year of Joram, the son of Ahab."
2 Kings,9,30,Jehu went to Jezreel. Jezebel heard about it. So she put makeup on her eyes and fixed her hair. Then she looked out of a window.
2 Kings,9,31,"Jehu entered the gate below. Jezebel said to him, “You are just like Zimri. You murdered your master. Have you come here in peace?”"
2 Kings,9,32,Jehu looked up at the window. “Who is on my side?” he called out. “Who?” Two or three officials looked down at him.
2 Kings,9,33,“Throw her down!” Jehu said. So they threw her down. Some of her blood splashed on the wall. Some of it splashed on Jehu’s chariot horses as they ran over her.
2 Kings,9,34,"Jehu went inside. He ate and drank. “The Lord put a curse on that woman,” he said. “Take proper care of her body. Bury her. After all, she was a king’s daughter.”"
2 Kings,9,35,"So they went out to bury her. But all they found was her head, feet and hands."
2 Kings,9,36,"They went back and reported it to Jehu. He told them, “That’s what the Lord said would happen. He announced it through his servant Elijah, who was from Tishbe. He said, ‘On a piece of land at Jezreel, dogs will eat up Jezebel’s body."
2 Kings,9,37,"Her body will end up as garbage on that piece of land. So no one will be able to say, “Here’s where Jezebel is buried.” ’ ”"
2 Kings,10,1,"Ahab’s royal family in the city of Samaria had a total of 70 sons. Jehu wrote some letters to the officials of the city. He also sent them to the elders there. And he sent them to the people who took care of Ahab’s children. Jehu said,"
2 Kings,10,2,"“Your master’s sons are with you. You also have chariots and horses and weapons. And you are living in a city that has high walls around it. As soon as you read this letter, here’s what I want you to do."
2 Kings,10,3,Choose the best and most respected son of your master. Place him on his father Joram’s throne. Then fight for your master’s royal house.”
2 Kings,10,4,"The leaders of Samaria were terrified. They said, “King Joram and King Ahaziah couldn’t stand up against Jehu. So how can we?”"
2 Kings,10,5,"The city governor and the person in charge of the palace sent a message to Jehu. The message was also from the elders and the people who took care of Ahab’s children. In the message, they said, “We will serve you. We’ll do anything you say. We won’t appoint anyone to be king. Do what you think is best.”"
2 Kings,10,6,"Then Jehu wrote them a second letter. He said, “You say you are on my side. You say you will obey me. If you really mean it, bring me the heads of your master’s sons. Meet me in Jezreel by this time tomorrow.” There were 70 royal princes. They were with the most important men of the city. Those men were in charge of raising them."
2 Kings,10,7,"When Jehu’s letter arrived, the men went and got the princes. They killed all 70 of them. They put their heads in baskets. Then they sent them to Jehu in Jezreel."
2 Kings,10,8,"When the messenger arrived, he spoke to Jehu. He told him, “The heads of the princes have been brought here.” Then Jehu ordered his men, “Put them in two piles. Stack them up at the entrance of the city gate until morning.”"
2 Kings,10,9,"The next morning Jehu went out. He stood in front of all the people. He said, “You aren’t guilty of doing anything wrong. I’m the one who made plans against my master Joram. I killed him. But who killed all these?"
2 Kings,10,10,I want you to know that the Lord has spoken against Ahab’s royal house. Not a word of what he has said will fail. The Lord has done exactly what he announced through his servant Elijah.”
2 Kings,10,11,So Jehu killed everyone from Ahab’s family who was in Jezreel. He also killed all Ahab’s chief men. And he killed Ahab’s close friends and his priests. He didn’t leave anyone alive in Ahab’s family.
2 Kings,10,12,"Then Jehu started out for Samaria. At Beth Eked of the Shepherds,"
2 Kings,10,13,"he saw some people. They were relatives of Ahaziah, the king of Judah. Jehu asked them, “Who are you?” They said, “We are Ahaziah’s relatives. We’ve come down to visit the families of the king and of his mother.”"
2 Kings,10,14,“Take them alive!” Jehu ordered. So his men took them alive. Then they killed them by the well of Beth Eked. They killed a total of 42 of them. Jehu didn’t leave anyone alive.
2 Kings,10,15,"Jehu left there. On the way he met Jehonadab. He was the son of Rekab. Jehonadab was on his way to see Jehu. Jehu greeted him. He asked, “Are you my friend? You know I’m your friend.” “I am,” Jehonadab answered. “If that’s true,” said Jehu, “hold out your hand.” So he did. Then Jehu helped him up into the chariot."
2 Kings,10,16,"Jehu said, “Come along with me. See how committed I am to serve the Lord .” Jehu had Jehonadab ride along in his chariot."
2 Kings,10,17,Jehu came to Samaria. He killed everyone there who was left from Ahab’s family. And so he completely destroyed Ahab’s royal house. That’s what the Lord had said would happen. He had spoken that message to Elijah.
2 Kings,10,18,"Then Jehu brought together all the people. He said to them, “Ahab served the god named Baal a little. I will serve him a lot."
2 Kings,10,19,Send for all of Baal’s prophets. Also send for all his priests and the others who serve him. Make sure that not a single one is missing. I’m going to hold a great sacrifice to honor Baal. Anyone who doesn’t come will be killed.” But Jehu was lying to them. He was planning to destroy everyone who served Baal.
2 Kings,10,20,"Jehu said, “Call everyone together to honor Baal.” So they did."
2 Kings,10,21,Then he sent a message all through Israel. All those who served Baal came. Not a single one of them stayed away. They crowded into Baal’s temple. It was full from one end to the other.
2 Kings,10,22,"Jehu spoke to the one who took care of the sacred robes. He told him, “Bring robes for everyone who serves Baal.” So he brought the robes out for them."
2 Kings,10,23,"Then Jehu went into Baal’s temple. Jehonadab, the son of Rekab, went with him. Jehu said to those who served Baal, “Look around. Make sure that no one who serves the Lord is here with you. Make sure only those who serve Baal are here.”"
2 Kings,10,24,"So they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Jehu had stationed 80 men outside. He warned them, “I’m placing some men in your hands. Don’t let a single one of them escape. If you do, you will pay for his life with yours.”"
2 Kings,10,25,"Jehu finished sacrificing the burnt offering. As soon as he did, he gave an order to the guards and officers. He commanded them, “Go inside and kill everyone. Don’t let a single one of them escape.” So they cut them down with their swords. The guards and officers threw the bodies outside. Then they entered the most sacred area inside Baal’s temple."
2 Kings,10,26,They brought the sacred stone of Baal outside. They burned it up.
2 Kings,10,27,So they destroyed Baal’s sacred stone. They also tore down Baal’s temple. People have used it as a public toilet to this day.
2 Kings,10,28,So Jehu destroyed the worship of the god named Baal in Israel.
2 Kings,10,29,"But he didn’t turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat. Jeroboam had caused Israel to commit those same sins. Jehu worshiped the golden calves at Bethel and Dan."
2 Kings,10,30,"The Lord said to Jehu, “You have done well. You have accomplished what is right in my eyes. You have done to Ahab’s royal house everything I wanted you to do. So your sons after you will sit on the throne of Israel. They will rule until the time of your children’s grandchildren.”"
2 Kings,10,31,But Jehu wasn’t careful to obey the law of the Lord . He didn’t obey the God of Israel with all his heart. He didn’t turn away from the sins of Jeroboam. Jeroboam had caused Israel to commit those same sins.
2 Kings,10,32,In those days the Lord began to make the kingdom of Israel smaller. Hazael gained control over many parts of Israel. He gained control over all their territory
2 Kings,10,33,"east of the Jordan River. It included the whole land of Gilead from Aroer by the Arnon River valley all the way to Bashan. That was the territory of Gad, Reuben and Manasseh."
2 Kings,10,34,The other events of Jehu’s rule are written down. Everything he did and accomplished is written in the official records of the kings of Israel.
2 Kings,10,35,Jehu joined the members of his family who had already died. He was buried in Samaria. His son Jehoahaz became the next king after him.
2 Kings,10,36,Jehu had ruled over Israel in Samaria for 28 years.
2 Kings,11,1,Athaliah was Ahaziah’s mother. She saw that her son was dead. So she began to destroy the whole royal house of Judah.
2 Kings,11,2,"But Jehosheba went and got Joash, the son of Ahaziah. Jehosheba was the daughter of King Jehoram and the sister of Ahaziah. She stole Joash away from among the royal princes. All of them were about to be murdered. She put Joash and his nurse in a bedroom. That’s how she hid him from Athaliah. And that’s why Athaliah didn’t kill him."
2 Kings,11,3,The child remained hidden with his nurse at the Lord ’s temple for six years. Athaliah ruled over the land during that time.
2 Kings,11,4,In the seventh year Jehoiada the priest sent for the commanders of military groups of 100 men. They were the commanders over the Carites and the guards. Jehoiada had them brought to him at the temple of the Lord . He made a covenant with them. At the temple he made them promise to be faithful. Then he showed them the king’s son.
2 Kings,11,5,"He gave them a command. He said, “Here’s what you must do. There are five groups of you. Some of you are in the three groups that are going on duty on the Sabbath day. A third of you must guard the royal palace."
2 Kings,11,6,A third of you must guard the Sur Gate. And a third of you must guard the gate that is behind the guard. All of you must take turns guarding the temple.
2 Kings,11,7,The rest of you are in the other two groups. Normally you are not on duty on the Sabbath day. But you also must guard the temple for the king.
2 Kings,11,8,Station yourselves around the king. Each of you must have his weapon in his hand. Anyone else who approaches your groups must be put to death. Stay close to the king no matter where he goes.”
2 Kings,11,9,The commanders of the military groups did just as Jehoiada the priest ordered. Each commander got his men and came to Jehoiada. Some of the men were going on duty on the Sabbath day. Others were going off duty.
2 Kings,11,10,Then Jehoiada gave weapons to the commanders. He gave them spears and shields. The weapons had belonged to King David. They had been in the Lord ’s temple.
2 Kings,11,11,The guards stationed themselves around the new king. Each of them had his weapon in his hand. They were near the altar and the temple. They stood from the south side of the temple to its north side.
2 Kings,11,12,"Jehoiada brought out Ahaziah’s son. He put the crown on him. He gave him a copy of the covenant. And he announced that Joash was king. Jehoiada and his sons anointed him. The people clapped their hands. Then they shouted, “May the king live a long time!”"
2 Kings,11,13,Athaliah heard the noise the guards and the people were making. So she went to the people at the Lord ’s temple.
2 Kings,11,14,"She looked, and there was the king! He was standing next to the pillar. That was the usual practice. The officers and trumpet players were standing beside the king. All the people of the land were filled with joy. They were blowing trumpets. Then Athaliah tore her royal robes. She called out, “Treason! It’s treason!”"
2 Kings,11,15,"Jehoiada the priest gave an order to the commanders of the military groups of 100 men. The commanders were in charge of the troops. He said to them, “Bring her away from the temple between the line of guards. Use your swords to kill anyone who follows her.” The priest had said, “She must not be put to death at the Lord ’s temple.”"
2 Kings,11,16,So they grabbed her as she reached the place where the horses enter the palace grounds. There she was put to death.
2 Kings,11,17,Then Jehoiada made a covenant between the Lord and the king and people. He had the king and people promise that they would be the Lord ’s people. Jehoiada also made a covenant between the king and the people.
2 Kings,11,18,All the people of the land went to Baal’s temple. They tore it down. They smashed to pieces the altars and the statues of gods. They killed Mattan in front of the altars. He was the priest of Baal. Then Jehoiada the priest stationed guards at the temple of the Lord.
2 Kings,11,19,Jehoiada took with him the commanders of groups of 100 men. They were the commanders over the Carites and the guards. He also took with him all the people of the land. All of them brought the new king down from the Lord ’s temple. They went into the palace. They entered it by going through the gate of the guards. Then the king sat down on the royal throne.
2 Kings,11,20,All the people of the land were filled with joy. And the city was calm. That’s because Athaliah had been killed with a sword at the palace.
2 Kings,11,21,Joash was seven years old when he became king.
2 Kings,12,1,Joash became king of Judah. It was in the seventh year of Jehu’s rule. Joash ruled in Jerusalem for 40 years. His mother’s name was Zibiah. She was from Beersheba.
2 Kings,12,2,Joash did what was right in the eyes of the Lord . Joash lived that way as long as Jehoiada the priest was teaching him.
2 Kings,12,3,But the high places weren’t removed. The people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there.
2 Kings,12,4,"Joash spoke to the priests. He said, “Collect all the money the people bring as sacred offerings to the Lord ’s temple. That includes the money collected when the men who are able to serve in the army are counted. It includes the money received from people who make a special promise to the Lord . It also includes the money people bring to the temple just because they want to."
2 Kings,12,5,Let each priest receive the money from one of the people in charge of the temple’s treasures. Then use all of that money to repair the temple where it needs it.”
2 Kings,12,6,It was now the 23rd year of the rule of King Joash. And the priests still hadn’t repaired the temple.
2 Kings,12,7,"So the king sent for Jehoiada the priest and the other priests. He asked them, “Why aren’t you repairing the temple where it needs it? Don’t take any more money from the people in charge of the treasures. Instead, hand it over so the temple can be repaired.”"
2 Kings,12,8,The priests agreed that they wouldn’t collect any more money from the people. They also agreed that they wouldn’t repair the temple themselves.
2 Kings,12,9,Jehoiada the priest got a chest. He drilled a hole in its lid. He placed the chest beside the altar for burnt offerings. The chest was on the right side as people enter the Lord ’s temple. Some priests guarded the entrance. They put into the chest all the money the people brought to the temple.
2 Kings,12,10,"From time to time there was a large amount of money in the chest. When that happened, the royal secretary and the high priest came. They counted the money the people had brought to the temple. Then they put it into bags."
2 Kings,12,11,"After they added it all up, they used it to repair the temple. They gave it to the men who had been put in charge of the work. Those men used it to pay the workers. They paid the builders and those who worked with wood."
2 Kings,12,12,They paid those who cut stones and those who laid them. They bought lumber and blocks of stone. So they used the money to repair the Lord ’s temple. They also paid all the other costs to make the temple like new again.
2 Kings,12,13,"The money the people brought to the Lord ’s temple wasn’t used to make silver bowls. It wasn’t used for wick cutters, sprinkling bowls or trumpets. And it wasn’t used for any other things made out of gold or silver."
2 Kings,12,14,"Instead, it was paid to the workers. They used it to repair the temple."
2 Kings,12,15,The royal secretary and the high priest didn’t require a report from those who were in charge of the work. That’s because they were completely honest. They always paid the workers.
2 Kings,12,16,Money was received from people who brought guilt offerings and sin offerings. But it wasn’t taken to the Lord ’s temple. It belonged to the priests.
2 Kings,12,17,"About that time Hazael, the king of Aram, went up and attacked Gath. Then he captured it. After that, he turned back to attack Jerusalem."
2 Kings,12,18,"But Joash, the king of Judah, didn’t want to go to war. So he took all the sacred objects. They had been set apart to the Lord by the kings who had ruled over Judah before him. Those kings were Jehoshaphat, Jehoram and Ahaziah. Joash took the gifts he himself had set apart. He took all the gold that was among the temple treasures. He also took all the gold from the royal palace. He sent all those things to Hazael, the king of Aram. Then Hazael pulled his army back from Jerusalem."
2 Kings,12,19,The other events of the rule of Joash are written down. Everything he did is written in the official records of the kings of Judah.

2 Kings,13,3,"So the Lord was very angry with Israel. For a long time he kept them under the power of Hazael, the king of Aram. The Lord also kept them under the power of his son Ben-Hadad."
2 Kings,13,4,Then Jehoahaz asked the Lord for help. The Lord listened to him. The Lord saw how badly the king of Aram was treating Israel.
2 Kings,13,5,"The Lord provided someone to save Israel. And they escaped from the power of Aram. So the Israelites lived in their own homes, just as they had before."
2 Kings,13,6,But the people didn’t turn away from the sins of the royal house of Jeroboam. He had caused Israel to commit those same sins. The people continued to commit them. And the pole used to worship the female god named Asherah remained standing in Samaria.
2 Kings,13,7,"The army of Jehoahaz had almost nothing left. All it had was 50 horsemen, 10 chariots and 10,000 soldiers on foot. The king of Aram had destroyed the rest of them. He had made them like dust at threshing time."

2 Kings,13,15,"Elisha said to Jehoash, “Get a bow and some arrows.” So he did."
2 Kings,13,16,"“Hold the bow in your hands,” Elisha said to the king of Israel. So Jehoash took hold of the bow. Then Elisha put his hands on the king’s hands."
2 Kings,13,17,"“Open the east window,” Elisha said. So he did. “Shoot!” Elisha said. So he shot. “That’s the Lord ’s arrow!” Elisha announced. “It means you will win the battle over Aram! You will completely destroy the men of Aram at Aphek.”"
2 Kings,13,18,"Elisha continued, “Get some arrows.” So the king did. Elisha told him, “Strike the ground.” Jehoash struck it three times. Then he stopped."
2 Kings,13,19,"The man of God was angry with him. He said, “You should have struck the ground five or six times. Then you would have won the war over Aram. You would have completely destroyed them. But now you will win only three battles over them.”"
2 Kings,13,20,Elisha died and was buried. Some robbers from Moab used to enter the country of Israel every spring.
2 Kings,13,21,"One day some Israelites were burying a man. Suddenly they saw a group of robbers. So they threw the man’s body into Elisha’s tomb. The body touched Elisha’s bones. When it did, the man came back to life again. He stood up on his feet."

2 Kings,15,31,The other events of the rule of Pekah are written down. Everything he did is written in the official records of the kings of Israel.
2 Kings,15,32,Jotham began to rule as king over Judah. It was in the second year that Pekah was king of Israel. He was the son of Remaliah. Jotham was the son of Uzziah.
2 Kings,15,33,Jotham was 25 years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for 16 years. His mother’s name was Jerusha. She was the daughter of Zadok.
2 Kings,15,34,"Jotham did what was right in the eyes of the Lord , just as his father Uzziah had done."
2 Kings,15,35,But the high places weren’t removed. The people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there. Jotham rebuilt the Upper Gate of the Lord ’s temple.
2 Kings,15,36,The other events of the rule of Jotham are written down. Everything he did is written in the official records of the kings of Judah.
2 Kings,15,37,In those days the Lord began to send Rezin and Pekah against Judah. Rezin was king of Aram. Pekah was the son of Remaliah.
2 Kings,15,38,Jotham joined the members of his family who had already died. He was buried in the family tomb in the city of King David. Jotham’s son Ahaz became the next king after him.
2 Kings,16,1,"Ahaz began to rule as king over Judah. It was in the 17th year of the rule of Pekah, the son of Remaliah. Ahaz was the son of Jotham."
2 Kings,16,2,Ahaz was 20 years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for 16 years. Ahaz didn’t do what was right in the eyes of the Lord his God. He didn’t do what King David had done.
2 Kings,16,3,He followed the ways of the kings of Israel. He even sacrificed his son in the fire to another god. He followed the practices of the nations. The Lord hated those practices. He had driven out those nations to make room for the Israelites.
2 Kings,16,4,Ahaz offered sacrifices and burned incense at the high places. He also did it on the tops of hills and under every green tree.
2 Kings,16,5,"Rezin and Pekah marched up to Jerusalem and surrounded it. Rezin was king of Aram. Pekah, the son of Remaliah, was king of Israel. They attacked Ahaz. But they couldn’t overpower him."
2 Kings,16,6,"At that time Rezin, the king of Aram, won back Elath for Aram. He drove out the people of Judah. Then the people of Edom moved into Elath. And they still live there to this day."
2 Kings,16,7,"Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-Pileser. He was king of Assyria. The message of Ahaz said, “I am your servant. You are my master. Come up and save me from the power of the kings of Aram and Israel. They are attacking me.”"
2 Kings,16,8,Ahaz took the silver and gold that were in the Lord ’s temple. He also took the silver and gold that were among the treasures in the royal palace. He sent all of it as a gift to the king of Assyria.
2 Kings,16,9,So the king of Assyria did what Ahaz asked him to do. He attacked the city of Damascus and captured it. He sent its people away to Kir. And he put Rezin to death.
2 Kings,16,10,"Then King Ahaz went to Damascus. He went there to see Tiglath-Pileser, the king of Assyria. Ahaz saw an altar in Damascus. He sent a drawing of it to Uriah the priest. Ahaz also sent him plans for building it."
2 Kings,16,11,So Uriah the priest built an altar. He followed all the plans King Ahaz had sent from Damascus. He finished it before Ahaz returned.
2 Kings,16,12,"The king came back from Damascus. When he saw the altar, he approached it. Then he offered sacrifices on it."
2 Kings,16,13,He offered up his burnt offering and grain offering. He poured out his drink offering. And he splashed the blood from his friendship offerings against the altar.
2 Kings,16,14,The bronze altar for burnt offerings stood in front of the Lord . It was between the new altar and the Lord ’s temple. Ahaz took the bronze altar away from the front of the temple. He put it on the north side of the new altar.
2 Kings,16,15,"Then King Ahaz gave orders to Uriah the priest. He said, “Offer sacrifices on the large new altar. Offer the morning burnt offering and the evening grain offering. Offer my burnt offering and my grain offering. Offer the burnt offering of all the people of the land. Offer their grain offering and their drink offering. Splash against this altar the blood from all the burnt offerings and sacrifices. But I will use the bronze altar to look for advice and direction.”"
2 Kings,16,16,Uriah the priest did just as King Ahaz had ordered.
2 Kings,16,17,Ahaz cut off the sides of the bronze stands. He removed the bowls from the stands. He removed the huge bowl from the bronze bulls it stood on. He placed the bowl on a stone base.
2 Kings,16,18,He took away the covered area that had been used on the Sabbath day. It had been built at the Lord ’s temple. He removed the royal entrance that was outside the temple. Ahaz did all these things to honor the king of Assyria.
2 Kings,16,19,The other events of the rule of Ahaz are written down. Everything he did is written in the official records of the kings of Judah.
2 Kings,16,20,Ahaz joined the members of his family who had already died. He was buried in the family tomb in the City of David. Ahaz’s son Hezekiah became the next king after him.
2 Kings,17,1,Hoshea became king of Israel in Samaria. It was in the 12th year that Ahaz was king of Judah. Hoshea ruled for nine years. He was the son of Elah.
2 Kings,17,2,Hoshea did what was evil in the eyes of the Lord . But he wasn’t as evil as the kings of Israel who ruled before him.
2 Kings,17,3,Shalmaneser came up to attack Hoshea. Shalmaneser was king of Assyria. He had been Hoshea’s master. He had forced Hoshea to bring him gifts.
2 Kings,17,4,"But the king of Assyria found out that Hoshea had turned against him. Hoshea had sent messengers to So, the king of Egypt. Hoshea didn’t send gifts to the king of Assyria anymore. He had been sending them every year. So Shalmaneser grabbed him and put him in prison."
2 Kings,17,5,The king of Assyria marched into the whole land of Israel. He marched to Samaria and surrounded it for three years. From time to time he attacked it.
2 Kings,17,6,"Finally, the king of Assyria captured Samaria. It was in the ninth year of Hoshea. The king of Assyria took the Israelites away from their own land. He sent them off to Assyria. He made some of them live in Halah. He made others live in Gozan on the Habor River. And he made others live in the towns of the Medes."
2 Kings,17,7,"All of this took place because the Israelites had sinned against the Lord their God. He had brought them up out of Egypt. He had brought them out from under the power of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. But they worshiped other gods."
2 Kings,17,8,The Lord had driven out other nations to make room for Israel. But they followed the evil practices of those nations. They also followed the practices that the kings of Israel had started.
2 Kings,17,9,The Israelites did things in secret against the Lord their God. What they did wasn’t right. They built high places for worship in all their towns. They built them at lookout towers. They also built them at cities that had high walls around them.
2 Kings,17,10,They set up sacred stones. And they set up poles used to worship the female god named Asherah. They did that on every high hill and under every green tree.
2 Kings,17,11,"The Lord had driven out nations to make room for Israel. But the Israelites burned incense at every high place, just as those nations had done. The Israelites did evil things that made the Lord very angry."
2 Kings,17,12,"They worshiped statues of gods. They did it even though the Lord had said, “Do not do that.”"
2 Kings,17,13,"The Lord warned Israel and Judah through all his prophets and seers. He said, “Turn from your evil ways. Keep my commands and rules. Obey every part of my Law. I commanded your people who lived long ago to obey it. And I gave it to you through my servants the prophets.”"
2 Kings,17,14,But the people wouldn’t listen. They were as stubborn as their people of long ago had been. Those people didn’t trust in the Lord their God.
2 Kings,17,15,"They refused to obey his rules. They broke the covenant he had made with them. They didn’t pay any attention to the rules he had warned them to keep. They worshiped worthless statues of gods. Then they themselves became worthless. They followed the example of the nations around them. They did it even though the Lord had ordered them not to. He had said, “Do not do as they do.”"
2 Kings,17,16,They turned away from all the commands of the Lord their God. They made two statues of gods for themselves. The statues were shaped like calves. They made a pole used to worship the female god named Asherah. They bowed down to all the stars. And they worshiped the god named Baal.
2 Kings,17,17,They sacrificed their sons and daughters in the fire. They practiced all kinds of evil magic. They gave up following God’s rules. They did only what was evil in the eyes of the Lord . All these things made him very angry.
2 Kings,17,18,So the Lord was very angry with Israel. He removed them from his land. Only the tribe of Judah was left.
2 Kings,17,19,And even Judah didn’t obey the commands of the Lord their God. They followed the practices Israel had started.
2 Kings,17,20,So the Lord turned his back on all the people of Israel. He made them suffer. He handed them over to people who stole everything they had. And finally he threw them out of his land.
2 Kings,17,21,"The Lord took control of Israel away from the royal house of David. The Israelites made Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, their king. Jeroboam tried to get Israel to stop following the Lord . He caused them to commit a terrible sin."
2 Kings,17,22,The Israelites were stubborn. They continued to commit all the sins Jeroboam had committed. They didn’t turn away from them.
2 Kings,17,23,So the Lord removed them from his land. That’s what he had warned them he would do. He had given that warning through all his servants the prophets. So the people of Israel were taken away from their country. They were forced to go to Assyria. And that’s where they still are.
2 Kings,17,24,"The king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Kuthah, Avva, Hamath and Sepharvaim. He made all of them live in the towns of Samaria. They took the place of the people of Israel. They lived in all the towns of Samaria."
2 Kings,17,25,"When they first lived there, they didn’t worship the Lord . So he sent lions among them. And the lions killed some of the people."
2 Kings,17,26,"A report was given to the king of Assyria. He was told, “You forced people to leave their own homes and live in the towns of Samaria. But they don’t know what the god of that country requires. So he has sent lions among them. And the lions are killing the people off. That’s because the people don’t know what that god requires.”"
2 Kings,17,27,"Then the king of Assyria gave an order. He said, “Get one of the priests you captured from Samaria. Send him back to live there. Have him teach the people what the god of that land requires.”"
2 Kings,17,28,So a priest went back to live in Bethel. He was one of the priests who had been forced to leave Samaria. He taught the people of Bethel how to worship the Lord.
2 Kings,17,29,"In spite of that, the people from each nation made statues of their own gods. They made them in all the towns where they had been forced to live. They set up those statues in small temples. The people of Samaria had built the temples at the high places."
2 Kings,17,30,The people from Babylon made statues of the god named Sukkoth Benoth. Those from Kuthah made statues of the god named Nergal. Those from Hamath made statues of the god named Ashima.
2 Kings,17,31,The Avvites made statues of the gods named Nibhaz and Tartak. The Sepharvites sacrificed their children in the fire to the gods named Adrammelek and Anammelek. They were the gods of Sepharvaim.
2 Kings,17,32,So the people of Samaria worshiped the Lord . But they also appointed all kinds of their own people to be their priests. The priests served in the small temples at the high places.
2 Kings,17,33,The people worshiped the Lord . But they also served their own gods. They followed the evil practices of the nations they had been taken from.
2 Kings,17,34,The people of Samaria are still stubborn. They continue in their old practices to this day. And now they don’t even worship the Lord . They don’t follow his directions and rules. They don’t obey his laws and commands. The Lord had given all these laws to the family of Jacob. He gave the name Israel to Jacob.
2 Kings,17,35,"The Lord made a covenant with the Israelites. At that time he commanded them, “Do not worship any other gods. Do not bow down to them. Do not serve them or sacrifice to them."
2 Kings,17,36,The Lord is the one you must worship. The Lord brought you up out of Egypt by his great power. He saved you by reaching out his mighty arm. You must bow down only to him. You must offer sacrifices only to him.
2 Kings,17,37,You must always be careful to follow his directions and rules. You must obey the laws and commands he wrote for you. Do not worship other gods.
2 Kings,17,38,"Do not forget the covenant I made with you. And remember, you must not worship other gods."
2 Kings,17,39,"Instead, worship the Lord your God. He will save you from the powerful hand of all your enemies.”"
2 Kings,17,40,"But the people wouldn’t listen. Instead, they were stubborn. They continued in their old practices."
2 Kings,17,41,"They worshiped the Lord . But at the same time, they served the statues of their gods. And to this day their children and grandchildren continue to do what their people before them did."
2 Kings,18,1,Hezekiah began to rule as king over Judah. It was in the third year that Hoshea was king of Israel. He was the son of Elah. Hezekiah was the son of Ahaz.
2 Kings,18,2,Hezekiah was 25 years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for 29 years. His mother’s name was Abijah. She was the daughter of Zechariah.
2 Kings,18,3,"Hezekiah did what was right in the eyes of the Lord , just as King David had done."
2 Kings,18,4,Hezekiah removed the high places. He smashed the sacred stones. He cut down the poles used to worship the female god named Asherah. He broke into pieces the bronze snake Moses had made. Up to that time the Israelites had been burning incense to it. They called it Nehushtan.
2 Kings,18,5,"Hezekiah trusted in the Lord , the God of Israel. There was no one like Hezekiah among all the kings of Judah. There was no king like him either before him or after him."
2 Kings,18,6,Hezekiah remained faithful to the Lord . He didn’t stop serving him. He obeyed the commands the Lord had given Moses.
2 Kings,18,7,"The Lord was with Hezekiah. Because of that, Hezekiah was successful in everything he did. He refused to remain under the control of the king of Assyria. He didn’t serve him."
2 Kings,18,8,He won the war against the Philistines. He won battles at their lookout towers. He won battles at their cities that had high walls around them. He won battles against the Philistines all the way to Gaza and its territory.
2 Kings,18,9,"Shalmaneser marched to Samaria and surrounded it. It was in the fourth year of King Hezekiah. That was the seventh year of Hoshea, the king of Israel. Hoshea was the son of Elah. Shalmaneser was king of Assyria."
2 Kings,18,10,"At the end of three years the army of Assyria captured Samaria. That happened in the sixth year of Hezekiah’s rule. It was the ninth year of the rule of Hoshea, the king of Israel."
2 Kings,18,11,The king of Assyria took the people of Israel away from their own land. He sent them off to Assyria. He made some of them live in Halah. He made others live in Gozan on the Habor River. And he made others live in the towns of the Medes.
2 Kings,18,12,"These things happened because the Israelites hadn’t obeyed the Lord their God. They had broken the covenant he had made with them. They had refused to do everything Moses, the servant of the Lord , had commanded. They hadn’t paid any attention to those commands. They hadn’t obeyed them."
2 Kings,18,13,Sennacherib attacked and captured all the cities of Judah that had high walls around them. It was in the 14th year of the rule of Hezekiah. Sennacherib was king of Assyria.
2 Kings,18,14,"Hezekiah, the king of Judah, sent a message to the king of Assyria at Lachish. Hezekiah said, “I have done what is wrong. Pull your troops back from me. Then I’ll pay you anything you ask me to.” The king of Assyria forced Hezekiah, the king of Judah, to give him 11 tons of silver. Hezekiah also had to give him one ton of gold."
2 Kings,18,15,So Hezekiah gave him all the silver in the Lord ’s temple. He also gave him all the silver among the treasures in the royal palace.
2 Kings,18,16,"Hezekiah, the king of Judah, had covered the doors and doorposts of the Lord ’s temple with gold. But now he had to strip it off. He had to give it to the king of Assyria."
2 Kings,18,17,The king of Assyria sent his highest commander from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. He also sent his chief officer and his field commander along with a large army. All of them came up to Jerusalem. They stopped at the channel that brings water from the Upper Pool. The channel was on the road to the Washerman’s Field.
2 Kings,18,18,"The Assyrians called for King Hezekiah. Eliakim, Shebna and Joah went out to them. Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, was in charge of the palace. Shebna was the secretary. Joah, the son of Asaph, kept the records."
2 Kings,18,19,"The field commander said to them, “Give Hezekiah this message. Tell him, “ ‘Sennacherib is the great king of Assyria. He says, “Why are you putting your faith in what your king says?"
2 Kings,18,20,You say you have a military plan. You say you have a strong army. But your words don’t mean anything. Who are you depending on? Why don’t you want to stay under my control?
2 Kings,18,21,"Look, I know you are depending on Egypt. Why are you doing that? Egypt is nothing but a broken papyrus stem. Try leaning on it. It will only cut your hand. Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, is just like that to everyone who depends on him."
2 Kings,18,22,"But suppose you say to me, ‘We are depending on the Lord our God.’ Didn’t Hezekiah remove your god’s high places and altars? Didn’t Hezekiah say to the people of Judah and Jerusalem, ‘You must worship at the altar in Jerusalem’?"
2 Kings,18,23,"“ ‘ “Go ahead and make a deal with my master, the king of Assyria. I’ll give you 2,000 horses. But only if you can put riders on them!"
2 Kings,18,24,You are depending on Egypt for chariots and horsemen. You can’t drive away even the least important officer among my master’s officials.
2 Kings,18,25,"Besides, do you think I’ve come without receiving a message from the Lord ? Have I come to attack and destroy this place without a message from him? The Lord himself told me to march out against your country. He told me to destroy it.” ’ ”"
2 Kings,18,26,"Then Shebna, Joah and Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, spoke to the field commander. They said, “Please speak to us in the Aramaic language. We understand it. Don’t speak to us in Hebrew. If you do, the people sitting on the city wall will be able to understand you.”"
2 Kings,18,27,"But the commander replied, “My master sent me to say these things. Are these words only for your master and you to hear? Aren’t they also for the people sitting on the wall? They are going to suffer just like you. They’ll have to eat their own waste. They’ll have to drink their own urine.”"
2 Kings,18,28,"Then the commander stood up and spoke in the Hebrew language. He called out, “Pay attention to what the great king of Assyria is telling you."
2 Kings,18,29,"He says, ‘Don’t let Hezekiah trick you. He can’t save you from my power."
2 Kings,18,30,"Don’t let Hezekiah talk you into trusting in the Lord . Don’t believe him when he says, “You can be sure that the Lord will save us. This city will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.” ’"
2 Kings,18,31,"“Don’t listen to Hezekiah. The king of Assyria says, ‘Make a peace treaty with me. Come over to my side. Then each one of you will eat fruit from your own vine and fig tree. Each one of you will drink water from your own well."
2 Kings,18,32,"You will do that until I come back. Then I’ll take you to a land just like yours. It’s a land that has a lot of grain and fresh wine. It has plenty of bread and vineyards. It has olive trees and honey. So choose life! Don’t choose death!’ “Don’t pay any attention to Hezekiah. He’s telling you a lie when he says, ‘The Lord will save us.’"
2 Kings,18,33,Has the god of any nation ever saved his land from the power of the king of Assyria?
2 Kings,18,34,"Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena and Ivvah? Have they saved Samaria from my power?"
2 Kings,18,35,Which one of all the gods of those countries has been able to save his land from me? So how can the Lord save Jerusalem from my power?”
2 Kings,18,36,"But the people remained silent. They didn’t say anything. That’s because King Hezekiah had commanded, “Don’t answer him.”"
2 Kings,18,37,"Then Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, went to Hezekiah. Eliakim was in charge of the palace. Shebna the secretary went with him. So did Joah, the son of Asaph. Joah kept the records. All of them went to Hezekiah with their clothes torn. They told him what the field commander had said."
2 Kings,19,1,"When King Hezekiah heard what the field commander had said, he tore his clothes. He put on the rough clothing people wear when they’re sad. Then he went into the Lord ’s temple."
2 Kings,19,2,"Hezekiah sent Eliakim, who was in charge of the palace, to Isaiah the prophet. Isaiah was the son of Amoz. Hezekiah also sent to Isaiah the leading priests and Shebna the secretary. All of them were wearing the same rough clothing."
2 Kings,19,3,"They told Isaiah, “Hezekiah says, ‘Today we’re in great trouble. The Lord is warning us. He’s bringing shame on us. Sometimes babies come to the moment when they should be born. But their mothers aren’t strong enough to allow them to be born. Today we are like those mothers. We aren’t strong enough to save ourselves."
2 Kings,19,4,"Perhaps the Lord your God will hear everything the field commander has said. His master, the king of Assyria, has sent him to make fun of the living God. Maybe the Lord your God will punish him for what he has heard him say. So pray for the remaining people who are still alive here.’ ”"
2 Kings,19,5,King Hezekiah’s officials came to Isaiah.
2 Kings,19,6,"Then Isaiah said to them, “Tell your master, ‘The Lord says, “Do not be afraid of what you have heard. The officers of the king of Assyria have spoken evil things against me."
2 Kings,19,7,Listen! I will send him news from his own country. It will make him want to return home. There I will have him killed by a sword.” ’ ”
2 Kings,19,8,The field commander heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish. So the commander pulled his troops back from Jerusalem. He went to join the king. He found out that the king was fighting against Libnah.
2 Kings,19,9,"During that time Sennacherib received a report. He was told that Tirhakah was marching out to fight against him. Tirhakah was the king of Cush. Sennacherib sent messengers again to Hezekiah with a letter. Sennacherib said,"
2 Kings,19,10,"“Tell Hezekiah, the king of Judah, ‘Don’t let the god you depend on trick you. He says, “Jerusalem will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.” But don’t believe him."
2 Kings,19,11,I’m sure you have heard about what the kings of Assyria have done to all the other countries. They have destroyed them completely. So do you think you will be saved?
2 Kings,19,12,"The kings who ruled before me destroyed many nations. Did the gods of those nations save them? Did the gods of Gozan, Harran or Rezeph save them? What about the gods of the people of Eden who were in Tel Assar?"
2 Kings,19,13,"Where is the king of Hamath? Where is the king of Arpad? Where are the kings of Lair, Sepharvaim, Hena and Ivvah?’ ”"
2 Kings,19,14,"When Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers, he read it. Then he went up to the Lord ’s temple. There he spread the letter out in front of the Lord."
2 Kings,19,15,"Hezekiah prayed to the Lord . He said, “ Lord , you are the God of Israel. You sit on your throne between the cherubim. You alone are God over all the kingdoms on earth. You have made heaven and earth."
2 Kings,19,16,"Listen, Lord . Hear us. Open your eyes, Lord . Look at the trouble we’re in. Listen to what Sennacherib is saying. You are the living God. And he dares to make fun of you!"
2 Kings,19,17,"“ Lord , it’s true that the kings of Assyria have completely destroyed many nations and their lands."
2 Kings,19,18,They have thrown the statues of the gods of those nations into the fire. And they have destroyed them. That’s because they weren’t really gods at all. They were nothing but statues made out of wood and stone. They were made by human hands.
2 Kings,19,19,"Lord our God, save us from the power of Sennacherib. Then all the kingdoms of the earth will know that you alone are the Lord . You alone are God.”"
2 Kings,19,20,"Isaiah sent a message to Hezekiah. Isaiah was the son of Amoz. Isaiah said, “The Lord is the God of Israel. The Lord says, ‘I have heard your prayer about Sennacherib, the king of Assyria.’"
2 Kings,19,21,"Here is the message the Lord has spoken against him. The Lord says, “ ‘You will not win the battle over Zion. Its people hate you and make fun of you. The people of Jerusalem lift up their heads proudly as you run away."
2 Kings,19,22,Who have you laughed at? Who have you spoken evil things against? Who have you raised your voice against? Who have you looked at so proudly? You have done it against me. I am the Holy One of Israel!
2 Kings,19,23,"Through your messengers you have dared to make fun of the Lord. And you have said, “I have many chariots. With them I have gone to the tops of the mountains. I’ve climbed the highest mountains in Lebanon. I’ve cut down its tallest cedar trees. I’ve cut down the best of its juniper trees. I’ve reached its farthest parts. I’ve reached its finest forests."
2 Kings,19,24,I’ve dug wells in strange lands. I’ve drunk the water from them. I’ve walked through all of Egypt’s streams. I’ve dried up every one of them.”
2 Kings,19,25,"“ ‘But I, the Lord , say, “Haven’t you heard what I have done? Long ago I arranged for you to do all of that. In days of old I planned it. Now I have made it happen. You have turned cities with high walls into piles of stone."
2 Kings,19,26,Their people do not have any power left. They are troubled and put to shame. They are like plants in the field. They are like new green plants. They are like grass that grows on a roof. It dries up before it is completely grown.
2 Kings,19,27,“ ‘ “But I know where you are. I know when you come and go. I know how very angry you are with me.
2 Kings,19,28,You roar against me and brag. And I have heard your bragging. So I will put my hook in your nose. I will put my bit in your mouth. And I will make you go home by the same way you came.” ’ ”
2 Kings,19,29,"The Lord said, “Hezekiah, here is a miraculous sign for you. “This year you will eat what grows by itself. In the second year you will eat what grows from that. But in the third year you will plant your crops and gather them in. You will plant your grapevines and eat their fruit."
2 Kings,19,30,Those who remain from the kingdom of Judah will be like plants. Once more they will put down roots and produce fruit.
2 Kings,19,31,Out of Jerusalem will come those who remain. Out of Mount Zion will come those who survive. “The Lord ’s great love will make sure that happens. He rules over all.
2 Kings,19,32,"“Here is a message from me about the king of Assyria. The Lord says, “ ‘The king of Assyria will not enter this city. He will not even shoot an arrow at it. He will not come near it with a shield. He will not build a ramp in order to climb over its walls."
2 Kings,19,33,"By the same way he came he will go home. He will not enter this city,’ announces the Lord."
2 Kings,19,34,‘I will guard this city and save it. I will do it for myself. And I will do it for my servant David.’ ”
2 Kings,19,35,"That night the angel of the Lord went into the camp of the Assyrians. He put to death 185,000 people there. The people of Jerusalem got up the next morning and looked out at the camp. There were all the dead bodies!"
2 Kings,19,36,"So Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, took the army tents down. Then he left. He returned to Nineveh and stayed there."
2 Kings,19,37,One day Sennacherib was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisrok. His sons Adrammelek and Sharezer killed him with their swords. Then they escaped to the land of Ararat. Esarhaddon became the next king after his father Sennacherib.
2 Kings,20,1,"In those days Hezekiah became very sick. He was about to die. Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, went to him. Isaiah told Hezekiah, “The Lord says, ‘Put everything in order. Make out your will. You are going to die soon. You will not get well again.’ ”"
2 Kings,20,2,"Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall. He prayed to the Lord . He said,"
2 Kings,20,3,"“ Lord , please remember how faithful I’ve been to you. I’ve lived the way you wanted me to. I’ve served you with all my heart. I’ve done what is good in your sight.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly."
2 Kings,20,4,"Isaiah was leaving the middle courtyard. Before he had left it, a message came to him from the Lord . He said,"
2 Kings,20,5,"“Go back and speak to Hezekiah. He is the ruler of my people. Tell him, ‘The Lord , the God of King David, says, “I have heard your prayer. I have seen your tears. And I will heal you. On the third day from now you will go up to my temple."
2 Kings,20,6,I will add 15 years to your life. And I will save you and this city from the power of the king of Assyria. I will guard this city. I will do it for myself. And I will do it for my servant David.” ’ ”
2 Kings,20,7,"Then Isaiah said, “Press some figs together. Spread them on a piece of cloth.” So that’s what they did. Then they applied it to Hezekiah’s boil. And he got well again."
2 Kings,20,8,"Hezekiah had said to Isaiah, “You say the Lord will heal me. You say that I’ll go up to his temple on the third day from now. What will the sign be to prove he’ll really do that?”"
2 Kings,20,9,"Isaiah answered, “The Lord will do what he has promised. Here is his sign to you. Do you want the shadow the sun makes to go forward ten steps? Or do you want it to go back ten steps?”"
2 Kings,20,10,"“It’s easy for the shadow to go forward ten steps,” said Hezekiah. “So have it go back ten steps.”"
2 Kings,20,11,Then Isaiah the prophet called out to the Lord . And the Lord made the shadow go back ten steps. It went back the ten steps it had gone down on the stairway Ahaz had made.
2 Kings,20,12,"At that time Marduk-Baladan, the king of Babylon, sent Hezekiah letters and a gift. He had heard that Hezekiah had been sick. Marduk-Baladan was the son of Baladan."
2 Kings,20,13,"Hezekiah received the messengers. He showed them everything in his storerooms. He showed them the silver and gold. He showed them the spices and the fine olive oil. He showed them where he kept his weapons. And he showed them all his treasures. In fact, he showed them everything in his palace and in his whole kingdom."
2 Kings,20,14,"Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah. He asked him, “What did those men say? Where did they come from?” “They came from a land far away,” Hezekiah said. “They came from Babylon.”"
2 Kings,20,15,"The prophet asked, “What did they see in your palace?” “They saw everything in my palace,” Hezekiah said. “I showed them all my treasures.”"
2 Kings,20,16,"Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Listen to the Lord ’s message. He says,"
2 Kings,20,17,"‘You can be sure the time will come when everything in your palace will be carried off to Babylon. Everything the kings before you have stored up until this day will be taken away. There will not be anything left,’ says the Lord."
2 Kings,20,18,‘Some of the members of your family line will be taken away. They will be your own flesh and blood. They will include the children who will be born into your family line in years to come. And they will serve the king of Babylon in his palace.’ ”
2 Kings,20,19,"“The message the Lord has spoken through you is good,” Hezekiah replied. He thought, “There will be peace and safety while I’m still living.”"
2 Kings,20,20,The other events of the rule of Hezekiah are written down. That includes how he made the pool and the tunnel. He used them to bring water into Jerusalem. Everything he accomplished is written in the official records of the kings of Judah.
2 Kings,20,21,Hezekiah joined the members of his family who had already died. Hezekiah’s son Manasseh became the next king after him.
2 Kings,21,1,Manasseh was 12 years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for 55 years. His mother’s name was Hephzibah.
2 Kings,21,2,Manasseh did what was evil in the eyes of the Lord . He followed the practices of the nations. The Lord hated those practices. He had driven those nations out to make room for the Israelites.
2 Kings,21,3,"Manasseh rebuilt the high places. His father Hezekiah had destroyed them. Manasseh also set up altars to the god named Baal. He made a pole used to worship the female god named Asherah. Ahab, the king of Israel, had done those same things. Manasseh even bowed down to all the stars. And he worshiped them."
2 Kings,21,4,"He built altars in the Lord ’s temple. The Lord had said about his temple, “I will put my Name there in Jerusalem.”"
2 Kings,21,5,In the two courtyards of the Lord ’s temple Manasseh built altars to honor all the stars.
2 Kings,21,6,He sacrificed his own son in the fire to another god. He practiced all kinds of evil magic. He got messages from those who had died. He talked to the spirits of the dead. He did many things that were evil in the eyes of the Lord . Manasseh made the Lord very angry.
2 Kings,21,7,"Manasseh had carved a pole used to worship the female god named Asherah. He put it in the temple. The Lord had spoken to David and his son Solomon about the temple. He had said, “My Name will be in this temple and in Jerusalem forever. Out of all the cities in the tribes of Israel I have chosen Jerusalem."
2 Kings,21,8,I gave this land to your people who lived long ago. I will not make the Israelites wander away from it again. But they must be careful to do everything I commanded them. They must obey the whole Law that my servant Moses gave them.”
2 Kings,21,9,But the people didn’t pay any attention. Manasseh led them astray. They did more evil things than the nations the Lord had destroyed. He had destroyed them to make room for the Israelites.
2 Kings,21,10,"The Lord spoke through his servants the prophets. He said,"
2 Kings,21,11,"“Manasseh, the king of Judah, has committed terrible sins. I hate them. Manasseh has done more evil things than the Amorites who were in the land before him. And he has led Judah to commit sin by worshiping his statues of gods."
2 Kings,21,12,"I am the Lord , the God of Israel. I tell you, ‘I am going to bring trouble on Jerusalem and Judah. It will be so horrible that the ears of everyone who hears about it will tingle."
2 Kings,21,13,"I will measure out punishment against Jerusalem, just as I did against Samaria. I used a plumb line against the royal family of Ahab. I used it to prove that they did not measure up to my standards. I will use the same plumb line against Jerusalem. I will wipe out Jerusalem, just as someone wipes a dish. I will wipe it and turn it upside down."
2 Kings,21,14,I will desert those who remain among my people. I will hand them over to their enemies. All their enemies will rob them.
2 Kings,21,15,That’s because my people have done what is evil in my sight. They have made me very angry. They have done that from the day their own people came out of Egypt until this day.’ ”
2 Kings,21,16,Manasseh also spilled the blood of many people who weren’t guilty of doing anything wrong. He spilled so much blood that he filled Jerusalem with it from one end of the city to the other. And he caused Judah to commit sin. So they also did what was evil in the eyes of the Lord.
2 Kings,21,17,The other events of the rule of Manasseh are written down. That includes the sin he committed. Everything he did is written in the official records of the kings of Judah.
2 Kings,21,18,Manasseh joined the members of his family who had already died. He was buried in his palace garden. It was called the garden of Uzza. Manasseh’s son Amon became the next king after him.
2 Kings,21,19,Amon was 22 years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for two years. His mother’s name was Meshullemeth. She was the daughter of Haruz. She was from Jotbah.
2 Kings,21,20,"Amon did what was evil in the eyes of the Lord , just as his father Manasseh had done."
2 Kings,21,21,He lived the way his father had lived. He worshiped the statues of the gods his father had worshiped. He bowed down to them.
2 Kings,21,22,"He deserted the Lord , the God of his people. He didn’t obey the Lord."
2 Kings,21,23,Amon’s officials made plans against him. They murdered the king in his palace.
2 Kings,21,24,Then the people of the land killed all those officials who had made plans against King Amon. Then the people of the land made his son Josiah king in his place.
2 Kings,21,25,The other events of the rule of Amon are written down. Everything he did is written in the official records of the kings of Judah.
2 Kings,21,26,Amon was buried in his grave in the garden of Uzza. Amon’s son Josiah became the next king after him.
2 Kings,22,1,Josiah was eight years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for 31 years. His mother’s name was Jedidah. She was the daughter of Adaiah. She was from Bozkath.
2 Kings,22,2,Josiah did what was right in the eyes of the Lord . He lived the way King David had lived. He didn’t turn away from it to the right or the left.
2 Kings,22,3,"King Josiah sent his secretary Shaphan to the Lord ’s temple. It was in the 18th year of Josiah’s rule. Shaphan was the son of Azaliah. Azaliah was the son of Meshullam. Josiah said,"
2 Kings,22,4,“Go up to Hilkiah the high priest. Have him add up the money that has been brought into the Lord ’s temple. The men who guard the doors have collected it from the people.
2 Kings,22,5,Have them put all the money in the care of certain men. These men have been put in charge of the work on the Lord ’s temple. Have them pay the workers who repair it.
2 Kings,22,6,Have them pay the builders and those who work with wood. Have them pay those who lay the stones. Also have them buy lumber and blocks of stone to repair the temple.
2 Kings,22,7,But they don’t have to report how they use the money that is given to them. That’s because they are completely honest.”
2 Kings,22,8,"Hilkiah the high priest spoke to Shaphan the secretary. Hilkiah said, “I’ve found the Book of the Law in the Lord ’s temple.” Hilkiah gave it to Shaphan, who read it."
2 Kings,22,9,"Then Shaphan went to King Josiah. Shaphan told him, “Your officials have paid out the money that was in the Lord ’s temple. They’ve put it in the care of the workers and directors there.”"
2 Kings,22,10,"Shaphan continued, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.” Shaphan read some of it to the king."
2 Kings,22,11,"The king heard the words of the Book of the Law. When he did, he tore his royal robes."
2 Kings,22,12,"He gave orders to Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Akbor, Shaphan the secretary and Asaiah. Ahikam was the son of Shaphan. Akbor was the son of Micaiah. And Asaiah was the king’s attendant. Josiah commanded them,"
2 Kings,22,13,“Go. Ask the Lord for advice. Ask him about what is written in this book that has been found. Do it for me. Also do it for the people and the whole nation of Judah. The Lord is very angry with us. That’s because our people who have lived before us didn’t obey the words of this book. They didn’t do everything written there about us.”
2 Kings,22,14,"Hilkiah the priest went to speak to Huldah the prophet. So did Ahikam, Akbor, Shaphan and Asaiah. Huldah was the wife of Shallum. Shallum was the son of Tikvah. Tikvah was the son of Harhas. Shallum took care of the sacred robes. Huldah lived in the New Quarter of Jerusalem."
2 Kings,22,15,"Huldah said to them, “The Lord is the God of Israel. He says, ‘Here is what you must tell the man who sent you to me."
2 Kings,22,16,"Tell him, “The Lord says, ‘I am going to bring horrible trouble on this place and its people. Everything written in the book the king of Judah has read will take place."
2 Kings,22,17,That’s because the people have deserted me. They have burned incense to other gods. They have made me very angry because of the statues of gods their hands have made. So my anger will burn like a fire against this place. And the fire of my anger will not be put out.’ ” ’
2 Kings,22,18,"The king of Judah sent you to ask the Lord for advice. Tell him, ‘The Lord is the God of Israel. He has a message for you about the things you heard. He says,"
2 Kings,22,19,"“Your heart was tender. You made yourself humble in the eyes of the Lord . You heard what I spoke against this place and its people. I said they would be under a curse. I told them they would be destroyed. You tore your royal robes and wept in front of me. And I have heard you,” announces the Lord."
2 Kings,22,20,“You will join the members of your family who have already died. You will be buried in peace. Your eyes will not see all the trouble I am going to bring on this place.” ’ ” Huldah’s answer was taken back to the king.
2 Kings,23,1,Then the king called together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
2 Kings,23,2,"He went up to the Lord ’s temple. The people of Judah and Jerusalem went with him. So did the priests and prophets. All of them went, from the least important of them to the most important. The king had all the words of the Book of the Covenant read to them. The book had been found in the Lord ’s temple."
2 Kings,23,3,"The king stood next to his pillar. He agreed to the terms of the covenant in front of the Lord . The king promised to serve the Lord and obey his commands, directions and rules. He promised to obey them with all his heart and with all his soul. So he agreed to the terms of the covenant written down in that book. Then all the people committed themselves to the covenant as well."
2 Kings,23,4,"Certain things in the Lord ’s temple had been made to honor other gods. They were the god named Baal, the female god named Asherah and all the stars in the sky. The king ordered Hilkiah the high priest to remove those things. The king ordered the priests who were next in rank and the men who guarded the doors to help Hilkiah. Josiah took those things that had been in the Lord ’s temple and burned them outside Jerusalem. He burned them in the fields in the Kidron Valley. And he took the ashes to Bethel."
2 Kings,23,5,Josiah got rid of the priests who served other gods. The kings of Judah had appointed those priests to burn incense. They burned the incense on the high places of the towns of Judah. And they burned it on the high places around Jerusalem. They burned incense to honor Baal and the sun and moon. They burned it to honor all the stars.
2 Kings,23,6,Josiah removed the Asherah pole from the Lord ’s temple. It had been used to worship the female god named Asherah. He took it to the Kidron Valley outside Jerusalem. There he burned it. He ground it into powder. And he scattered it over the graves of the ordinary people.
2 Kings,23,7,He also tore down the rooms where the male temple prostitutes stayed. Those rooms were in the Lord ’s temple. Women had made cloth for Asherah in them.
2 Kings,23,8,Josiah brought all the priests from the towns of Judah and destroyed the high places. He destroyed them from Geba all the way to Beersheba. The priests had burned incense on them. Josiah broke down the gate at the entrance of the Gate of Joshua. It was on the left side of Jerusalem’s city gate. Joshua was the city governor.
2 Kings,23,9,"The priests of the high places didn’t serve at the Lord ’s altar in Jerusalem. In spite of that, they ate with the other priests. All of them ate bread made without yeast."
2 Kings,23,10,Josiah destroyed the high place at Topheth in the Valley of Ben Hinnom. He didn’t want anyone to use the high place to sacrifice his son or daughter in the fire to the god named Molek.
2 Kings,23,11,Josiah removed the statues of horses from the entrance to the Lord ’s temple. The kings of Judah had set them apart to honor the sun. The statues were in the courtyard. They were near the room of an official named Nathan-Melek. Josiah burned the chariots that had been set apart to honor the sun.
2 Kings,23,12,He pulled down the altars the kings of Judah had set up. They had put them on the palace roof near the upstairs room of Ahaz. Josiah also pulled down the altars Manasseh had built. They were in the two courtyards of the Lord ’s temple. Josiah removed the altars from there. He smashed them to pieces. Then he threw the broken pieces into the Kidron Valley.
2 Kings,23,13,"The king also destroyed the high places that were east of Jerusalem. They were at the southern end of the Mount of Olives. They were the ones Solomon, the king of Israel, had built. He had built a high place for worshiping Ashtoreth. She was the evil female god of the people of Sidon. Solomon had also built one for worshiping Chemosh. He was the evil god of Moab. And Solomon had built one for worshiping Molek. He was the god of the people of Ammon. The Lord hated that god."
2 Kings,23,14,Josiah smashed the sacred stones. He cut down the poles used to worship the female god named Asherah. Then he covered all those places with human bones.
2 Kings,23,15,"There was an altar at Bethel. It was at the high place made by Jeroboam, the son of Nebat. Jeroboam had caused Israel to commit sin. Even that altar and high place were destroyed by Josiah. He burned the high place. He ground it into powder. He also burned the Asherah pole."
2 Kings,23,16,Then Josiah looked around. He saw the tombs on the side of the hill. He had the bones removed from them. And he burned them on the altar to make it “unclean.” That’s what the Lord had said would happen. He had spoken that message through a man of God. The man had announced those things long before they took place.
2 Kings,23,17,"The king asked, “What’s that stone on the grave over there?” The people of the city said, “It marks the tomb where the man of God is buried. He came from Judah. He spoke against the altar at Bethel. He announced the very things you have done to it.”"
2 Kings,23,18,"“Leave it alone,” Josiah said. “Don’t let anyone touch his bones.” So they spared his bones. They also spared the bones of the prophet who had come from the northern kingdom of Israel."
2 Kings,23,19,Josiah did in the rest of the northern kingdom the same things he had done at Bethel. He removed all the small temples at the high places. He made them “unclean.” The kings of Israel had built them in the towns of the northern kingdom. The people in those towns had made the Lord very angry.
2 Kings,23,20,Josiah killed all the priests of those high places on the altars. He burned human bones on the altars. Then he went back to Jerusalem.
2 Kings,23,21,"The king gave an order to all the people. He said, “Celebrate the Passover Feast to honor the Lord your God. Do what is written in this Book of the Covenant.”"
2 Kings,23,22,A Passover Feast like that one had not been held for a long time. There hadn’t been any like it in the days of the judges who led Israel. And there hadn’t been any like it during the whole time the kings of Israel and Judah were ruling.
2 Kings,23,23,King Josiah celebrated the Passover Feast in Jerusalem to honor the Lord . It was in the 18th year of his rule.
2 Kings,23,24,And that’s not all. Josiah got rid of those who got messages from people who had died. He got rid of those who talked to the spirits of people who had died. He got rid of the statues of family gods and the statues of other gods. He got rid of everything else the Lord hates that was in Judah and Jerusalem. He did it to carry out what the law required. That law was written in the book that Hilkiah the priest had found in the Lord ’s temple.
2 Kings,23,25,There was no king like Josiah either before him or after him. None of them turned to the Lord as he did. He obeyed the Lord with all his heart and all his soul. He obeyed him with all his strength. He did everything the Law of Moses required.
2 Kings,23,26,"In spite of that, the Lord didn’t turn away from his great anger against Judah. That’s because of everything Manasseh had done to make him very angry."
2 Kings,23,27,"So the Lord said, “I will remove Judah from my land. I will do to them what I did to Israel. I will turn my back on Jerusalem. It is the city I chose. I will also turn my back on this temple. I spoke about it. I said, ‘I will put my Name there.’ ”( 1 Kings 8:29)"
2 Kings,23,28,The other events of the rule of Josiah are written down. Everything he did is written in the official records of the kings of Judah.
2 Kings,23,29,"Pharaoh Necho was king of Egypt. He marched up to the Euphrates River. He went there to help the king of Assyria. It happened while Josiah was king. Josiah marched out to meet Necho in battle. When Necho saw him at Megiddo, he killed him."
2 Kings,23,30,Josiah’s servants brought his body in a chariot from Megiddo to Jerusalem. They buried him in his own tomb. Then the people of the land went and got Jehoahaz. They anointed him as king in place of his father Josiah.
2 Kings,23,31,Jehoahaz was 23 years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for three months. His mother’s name was Hamutal. She was the daughter of Jeremiah. She was from Libnah.
2 Kings,23,32,Jehoahaz did what was evil in the eyes of the Lord . He did just as the kings who had ruled before him had done.
2 Kings,23,33,Pharaoh Necho put him in chains at Riblah in the land of Hamath. That kept him from ruling in Jerusalem. Necho made the people of Judah pay him a tax of almost four tons of silver and 75 pounds of gold.
2 Kings,23,34,Pharaoh Necho made Eliakim king in place of his father Josiah. Necho changed Eliakim’s name to Jehoiakim. But he took Jehoahaz with him to Egypt. And that’s where Jehoahaz died.
2 Kings,23,35,"Jehoiakim paid Pharaoh Necho the silver and gold he required. To get the money, Jehoiakim taxed the land. He forced the people to give him the silver and gold. He made each one pay him what he required."
2 Kings,23,36,Jehoiakim was 25 years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for 11 years. His mother’s name was Zebidah. She was the daughter of Pedaiah. She was from Rumah.
2 Kings,23,37,Jehoiakim did what was evil in the eyes of the Lord . He did just as the kings who had ruled before him had done.
2 Kings,24,1,"During Jehoiakim’s rule, Nebuchadnezzar marched into the land and attacked it. He was king of Babylon. He became Jehoiakim’s master for three years. But then Jehoiakim decided he didn’t want to remain under Nebuchadnezzar’s control."
2 Kings,24,2,"The Lord sent robbers against Jehoiakim from Babylon, Aram, Moab and Ammon. He sent them to destroy Judah. That’s what the Lord had said would happen. He had spoken that message through his servants the prophets."
2 Kings,24,3,These things happened to Judah in keeping with what the Lord had commanded. He brought enemies against his people in order to remove them from his land. He removed them because of all the sins Manasseh had committed.
2 Kings,24,4,"Manasseh had spilled the blood of many people who weren’t guilty of doing anything wrong. In fact, he spilled so much of their blood that he filled Jerusalem with it. So the Lord refused to forgive him."
2 Kings,24,5,The other events of the rule of Jehoiakim are written down. Everything he did is written in the official records of the kings of Judah.
2 Kings,24,6,Jehoiakim joined the members of his family who had already died. Jehoiakim’s son Jehoiachin became the next king after him.
2 Kings,24,7,The king of Egypt didn’t march out from his own country again. That’s because the king of Babylon had taken so much of his territory. It reached from the Wadi of Egypt all the way to the Euphrates River.
2 Kings,24,8,Jehoiachin was 18 years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for three months. His mother’s name was Nehushta. She was the daughter of Elnathan. She was from Jerusalem.
2 Kings,24,9,Jehoiachin did what was evil in the eyes of the Lord . He did just as his father Jehoiakim had done.
2 Kings,24,10,"At that time the officers of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, marched to Jerusalem. They surrounded it and got ready to attack it."
2 Kings,24,11,Nebuchadnezzar himself came up to the city. He arrived while his officers were attacking it.
2 Kings,24,12,"Jehoiachin, the king of Judah, handed himself over to Nebuchadnezzar. Jehoiachin’s mother did the same thing. And so did all his attendants, nobles and officials. The king of Babylon took Jehoiachin away as his prisoner. It was in the eighth year of Nebuchadnezzar’s rule."
2 Kings,24,13,"Nebuchadnezzar removed the treasures from the Lord ’s temple. He also removed the treasures from the royal palace. He cut up the gold objects that Solomon, the king of Israel, had made for the temple. That’s what the Lord had announced would happen."
2 Kings,24,14,"Nebuchadnezzar took all the people of Jerusalem to the land of Babylon as prisoners. That included all the officers and fighting men. It also included all the skilled workers. The total number of prisoners was 10,000. Only the poorest people were left in the land."
2 Kings,24,15,"Nebuchadnezzar took Jehoiachin to Babylon as his prisoner. He also took the king’s mother from Jerusalem to Babylon. And he took Jehoiachin’s wives, his officials and the most important people of the land."
2 Kings,24,16,"The king also forced the whole army of 7,000 soldiers to go away to the land of Babylon. Those men were strong and able to go to war. And the king forced 1,000 skilled workers to go to Babylon."
2 Kings,24,17,Nebuchadnezzar made Jehoiachin’s uncle Mattaniah king in his place. And Nebuchadnezzar changed Mattaniah’s name to Zedekiah.
2 Kings,24,18,Zedekiah was 21 years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for 11 years. His mother’s name was Hamutal. She was the daughter of Jeremiah. She was from Libnah.
2 Kings,24,19,Zedekiah did what was evil in the eyes of the Lord . He did just as Jehoiakim had done.
2 Kings,24,20,The enemies of Jerusalem and Judah attacked them because the Lord was angry. In the end the Lord threw them out of his land. Zedekiah also refused to remain under the control of Nebuchadnezzar.
2 Kings,25,1,Nebuchadnezzar was king of Babylon. He marched out against Jerusalem. His whole army went with him. It was in the ninth year of the rule of Zedekiah. It was on the tenth day of the tenth month. Nebuchadnezzar set up camp outside the city. He brought in war machines all around it.
2 Kings,25,2,It was surrounded until the 11th year of King Zedekiah’s rule.
2 Kings,25,3,"By the ninth day of the fourth month, there wasn’t any food left in the city. So the people didn’t have anything to eat."
2 Kings,25,4,Then the Babylonians broke through the city wall. Judah’s whole army ran away at night. They went out through the gate between the two walls near the king’s garden. They escaped even though the Babylonians surrounded the city. Judah’s army ran toward the Arabah Valley.
2 Kings,25,5,But the Babylonian army chased King Zedekiah. They caught up with him in the plains near Jericho. All his soldiers were separated from him. They had scattered in every direction.
2 Kings,25,6,The king was captured. He was taken to the king of Babylon at Riblah. That’s where Nebuchadnezzar decided how he would be punished.
2 Kings,25,7,Nebuchadnezzar’s men killed the sons of Zedekiah. They forced him to watch it with his own eyes. Then they poked out his eyes. They put him in bronze chains. And they took him to Babylon.
2 Kings,25,8,"Nebuzaradan was an official of the king of Babylon. In fact, he was commander of the royal guard. He came to Jerusalem. It was in the 19th year that Nebuchadnezzar was king of Babylon. It was on the seventh day of the fifth month."
2 Kings,25,9,Nebuzaradan set the Lord ’s temple on fire. He also set fire to the royal palace and all the houses in Jerusalem. He burned down every important building.
2 Kings,25,10,The whole Babylonian army broke down the walls around Jerusalem. That’s what the commander told them to do.
2 Kings,25,11,Some people still remained in the city. But Nebuzaradan the commander took them away as prisoners. He also took the rest of the people of the land. That included those who had joined the king of Babylon.
2 Kings,25,12,But the commander left behind some of the poorest people of the land. He told them to work in the vineyards and fields.
2 Kings,25,13,The Babylonian army destroyed the Lord ’s temple. They broke the bronze pillars into pieces. They broke up the bronze stands that could be moved around. And they broke up the huge bronze bowl. Then they carried the bronze away to Babylon.
2 Kings,25,14,"They also took away the pots, shovels, wick cutters and dishes. They took away all the bronze objects used for any purpose in the temple."
2 Kings,25,15,The commander of the royal guard took away the shallow cups for burning incense. He took away the sprinkling bowls. So he took away everything made out of pure gold or silver.
2 Kings,25,16,"The bronze was more than anyone could weigh. It included the bronze from the two pillars, the huge bowl and the stands. Solomon had made all those things for the Lord ’s temple."
2 Kings,25,17,Each pillar was 27 feet high. The bronze top of one pillar was four and a half feet high. It was decorated with a set of bronze chains and pomegranates all around it. The other pillar was just like it. It also had a set of chains.
2 Kings,25,18,The commander of the guard took some prisoners. They included Seraiah the chief priest and Zephaniah the priest who was next in rank. They also included the three men who guarded the temple doors.
2 Kings,25,19,Some people were still left in the city. The commander took as a prisoner the officer who was in charge of the fighting men. He took the five men who gave advice to the king. He also took the secretary. He was the chief officer in charge of getting the people of the land to serve in the army. And he took 60 of those people serving in the army who were still in the city.
2 Kings,25,20,Nebuzaradan the commander took all of them away. He brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
2 Kings,25,21,There the king had them put to death. Riblah was in the land of Hamath. So the people of Judah were taken as prisoners. They were taken far away from their own land.
2 Kings,25,22,"Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, had left some people behind in Judah. He appointed Gedaliah to govern them. Gedaliah was the son of Ahikam. Ahikam was the son of Shaphan."
2 Kings,25,23,"All of Judah’s army officers and their men heard about what had happened. They heard that the king had appointed Gedaliah as governor. So they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, came. So did Johanan, the son of Kareah. Seraiah, the son of Tanhumeth, also came. And so did Jaazaniah, the son of the Maakathite. All their men came too. Seraiah was from Netophah."
2 Kings,25,24,"Gedaliah promised to help them and their men. He spoke in a kind way to them. He said, “Don’t be afraid of the Babylonian officials. Make your homes in the land of Judah. Serve the king of Babylon. Then things will go well with you.”"
2 Kings,25,25,"But in the seventh month Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, came with ten men. He killed Gedaliah. He also killed the people of Judah and the Babylonians who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah. Nethaniah was the son of Elishama. Ishmael was a member of the royal family."
2 Kings,25,26,"After he had killed Gedaliah, all the people ran away to Egypt. Everyone from the least important of them to the most important ran away. The army officers went with them. All of them went to Egypt because they were afraid of the Babylonians."
2 Kings,25,27,"Awel-Marduk set Jehoiachin, the king of Judah, free from prison. It was in the 37th year after Jehoiachin had been taken away to Babylon. It was also the year Awel-Marduk became king of Babylon. It was on the 27th day of the 12th month."
2 Kings,25,28,Awel-Marduk spoke kindly to Jehoiachin. He gave him a place of honor. Other kings were with Jehoiachin in Babylon. But his place was more important than theirs.
2 Kings,25,29,So Jehoiachin put his prison clothes away. For the rest of Jehoiachin’s life the king provided what he needed.
2 Kings,25,30,The king did that for Jehoiachin day by day as long as he lived.
