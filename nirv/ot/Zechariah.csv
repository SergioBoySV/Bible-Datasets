Zechariah,1,1,A message from the Lord came to Zechariah the prophet. Zechariah was the son of Berekiah. Berekiah was the son of Iddo. It was the eighth month of the second year that Darius was king of Persia. Here is what Zechariah said.
Zechariah,1,2,The Lord who rules over all was very angry with your people of long ago.
Zechariah,1,3,"And now he says to us, “Return to me. Then I will return to you,” announces the Lord."
Zechariah,1,4,"“Do not be like your people of long ago. The earlier prophets gave them my message. I said, ‘Stop doing what is evil. Turn away from your sinful practices.’ But they would not listen to me. They would not pay any attention,” announces the Lord."
Zechariah,1,5,“Where are those people now? And what about my prophets? Do they live forever?
Zechariah,1,6,"I commanded my servants the prophets what to say. I told them what I planned to do. But your people refused to obey me. So I had to punish them. “Then they had a change of heart. They said, ‘The Lord who rules over all has punished us because of how we have lived. He was fair and right to do that. He has done to us just what he decided to do.’ ”"
Zechariah,1,7,A message from the Lord came to Zechariah the prophet. Zechariah was the son of Berekiah. Berekiah was the son of Iddo. The message came during the second year that Darius was king. It was the 24th day of the 11th month. That’s the month of Shebat.
Zechariah,1,8,"I had a vision at night. I saw a man sitting on a red horse. He was standing among the myrtle trees in a valley. Behind him were red, brown and white horses."
Zechariah,1,9,"An angel was talking with me. I asked him, “Sir, what are these?” He answered, “I will show you what they are.”"
Zechariah,1,10,"Then the man standing among the myrtle trees spoke. He said, “They are the messengers the Lord has sent out. He told them to go all through the earth.”"
Zechariah,1,11,"They brought a report to the angel of the Lord . He was standing among the myrtle trees. They said to him, “We have gone all through the earth. We’ve found the whole world enjoying peace and rest.”"
Zechariah,1,12,"Then the angel of the Lord spoke up. He said, “ Lord , you rule over all. How long will you keep from showing your tender love to Jerusalem? How long will you keep it from the towns of Judah? You have been angry with them for 70 years.”"
Zechariah,1,13,So the Lord replied with kind and comforting words. He spoke them to the angel who talked with me.
Zechariah,1,14,"Then the angel said, “Announce this message. Say, ‘The Lord who rules over all says, “I am very jealous for my people in Jerusalem and Zion."
Zechariah,1,15,And I am very angry with the nations that feel secure. I was only a little angry with my people. But the nations went too far and tried to wipe them out.”
Zechariah,1,16,"“ ‘So the Lord says, “I will return to Jerusalem. I will show its people my tender love. My temple will be rebuilt there. Workers will use a measuring line when they rebuild Jerusalem,” announces the Lord."
Zechariah,1,17,"“ ‘He says, “My towns will be filled with good things once more. I will comfort Zion. And I will choose Jerusalem again.” ’ ”"
Zechariah,1,18,Then I looked up and saw four animal horns.
Zechariah,1,19,"I spoke to the angel who was talking with me. “What are these horns?” I asked. He said, “They are the powerful nations that scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.”"
Zechariah,1,20,Then the Lord showed me four skilled workers.
Zechariah,1,21,"I asked, “What are they coming to do?” He answered, “The horns are the powerful nations that scattered the people of Judah. That made Judah helpless. But these four skilled workers have come to terrify the horns. The workers will destroy the power of those nations. Those nations had used their power to scatter Judah’s people.”"
Zechariah,2,1,Then I looked up and saw a man. He was holding a measuring line.
Zechariah,2,2,"“Where are you going?” I asked. “To measure Jerusalem,” he answered. “I want to find out how wide and how long it is.”"
Zechariah,2,3,"The angel who was talking with me was leaving. At that time, another angel came over to him."
Zechariah,2,4,"He said to him, “Run! Tell that young man Zechariah, ‘Jerusalem will be a city that does not have any walls around it. It will have huge numbers of people and animals in it."
Zechariah,2,5,"And I myself will be like a wall of fire around it,’ announces the Lord . ‘I will be the city’s glory.’"
Zechariah,2,6,"“Israel, I have scattered you,” announces the Lord . “I have used the power of the four winds of heaven to do it. Come quickly! Run away from the land of the north,” announces the Lord."
Zechariah,2,7,"“Come, people of Zion! Escape, you who live in Babylon!”"
Zechariah,2,8,"The Lord rules over all. His angel says to Israel, “The Glorious One has sent me to punish the nations that have robbed you of everything. That’s because anyone who hurts you hurts those the Lord loves and guards."
Zechariah,2,9,So I will raise my powerful hand to strike down your enemies. Their own slaves will rob them of everything. Then you will know that the Lord who rules over all has sent me.
Zechariah,2,10,"“ ‘People of Zion, shout and be glad! I am coming to live among you,’ announces the Lord."
Zechariah,2,11,"‘At that time many nations will join themselves to me. And they will become my people. I will live among you,’ says the Lord . Then you will know that the Lord who rules over all has sent me to you."
Zechariah,2,12,He will receive Judah as his share in the holy land. And he will choose Jerusalem again.
Zechariah,2,13,"All you people of the world, be still because the Lord is coming. He is getting ready to come down from his holy temple in heaven.”"
Zechariah,3,1,Then the Lord showed me Joshua the high priest. He was standing in front of the angel of the Lord . Satan was standing to the right of Joshua. He was there to bring charges against the high priest.
Zechariah,3,2,"The Lord said to Satan, “May the Lord correct you! He has chosen Jerusalem. So may he correct you! Isn’t this man Joshua like a burning stick pulled out of the fire?”"
Zechariah,3,3,Joshua stood in front of the angel. He was wearing clothes that were very dirty.
Zechariah,3,4,"The angel spoke to those who were standing near him. He said, “Take his dirty clothes off.” He said to Joshua, “I have taken your sin away. I will put fine clothes on you.”"
Zechariah,3,5,"I added, “Put a clean turban on his head.” So they did. And they dressed him while the angel of the Lord stood by."
Zechariah,3,6,"Then the angel spoke to Joshua. He said,"
Zechariah,3,7,"“The Lord who rules over all says, ‘You must obey me. You must do what I have commanded. Then you will rule in my temple. You will be in charge of my courtyards. And I will give you a place among these who are standing here."
Zechariah,3,8,"“ ‘High Priest Joshua, pay attention! I want you other priests who are sitting with Joshua to listen also. All you men are signs of things to come. I am going to bring to you my servant the Branch."
Zechariah,3,9,"Look at the stone I have put in front of Joshua! There are seven eyes on that one stone. I will carve a message on it,’ says the Lord who rules over all. ‘And I will remove the sin of this land in one day."
Zechariah,3,10,"“ ‘At that time each of you will invite your neighbors to visit you. They will sit under your vines and fig trees,’ announces the Lord .”"
Zechariah,4,1,Then the angel who was talking with me returned. He woke me up. It was as if I had been asleep.
Zechariah,4,2,"“What do you see?” he asked me. “I see a solid gold lampstand,” I answered. “It has a bowl on top of it. There are seven lamps on it. Seven tubes lead to the lamps."
Zechariah,4,3,There are two olive trees by the lampstand. One is on its right side. The other is on its left.”
Zechariah,4,4,"I asked the angel who was talking with me, “Sir, what are these?”"
Zechariah,4,5,"He answered, “Don’t you know what they are?” “No, sir,” I replied."
Zechariah,4,6,"So he said to me, “A message from the Lord came to Zerubbabel. The Lord said, ‘Your strength will not get my temple rebuilt. Your power will not do it either. Only the power of my Spirit will do it,’ says the Lord who rules over all."
Zechariah,4,7,"“So nothing can stop Zerubbabel from completing the temple. Even a mountain of problems will be smoothed out by him. When the temple is finished, he will put its most important stone in place. Then the people will shout, ‘God bless it! God bless it!’ ”"
Zechariah,4,8,"Then a message from the Lord came to me. His angel said,"
Zechariah,4,9,“The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this temple. His hands will also complete it. Then you will know that the Lord who rules over all has sent me to you.
Zechariah,4,10,“Do not look down on the small amount of work done on the temple so far. The seven eyes of the Lord look over the whole earth. They will see Zerubbabel holding the most important stone. They will be filled with joy when they see it.”
Zechariah,4,11,"Then I said to the angel, “I see two olive trees. One is on the right side of the lampstand. The other is on the left. What are these trees?”"
Zechariah,4,12,"I continued, “I also see two olive branches. They are next to the two gold pipes that pour out golden olive oil. What are these branches?”"
Zechariah,4,13,"He answered, “Don’t you know what they are?” “No, sir,” I said."
Zechariah,4,14,"So he told me, “They are Zerubbabel and Joshua. The Lord of the whole earth has anointed them to serve him.”"
Zechariah,5,1,I looked up again and saw a flying scroll.
Zechariah,5,2,"“What do you see?” the angel asked me. “A scroll flying in the air,” I replied. “It’s 30 feet long and 15 feet wide.”"
Zechariah,5,3,"He said to me, “A curse sent by the Lord is written on it. It is going out over the whole land. Every thief will be driven out of the land. That is what it says on one side of the scroll. Everyone who lies when promising to tell the truth will also be driven out. That is what it says on the other side."
Zechariah,5,4,"The Lord who rules over all announces, ‘I will send the curse out. It will enter the house of the thief. It will also enter the house of anyone who lies when making a promise in my name. It will remain in that house and destroy it completely. It will pull down its beams and stones.’ ”"
Zechariah,5,5,"Then the angel who was talking with me came forward. He said to me, “Look at what is coming.”"
Zechariah,5,6,"“What is it?” I asked. “A basket,” he replied. “The sins of the people all through the land are in it.”"
Zechariah,5,7,Then the basket’s cover was lifted up. It was made out of lead. A woman was sitting in the basket!
Zechariah,5,8,"The angel said, “She stands for everything that is evil.” Then he pushed her down into the basket. He put the lead cover back over it."
Zechariah,5,9,I looked up and saw two other women. They had wings like the wings of a stork. A wind sent by the Lord carried them along. They lifted the basket up between heaven and earth.
Zechariah,5,10,“Where are they taking the basket?” I asked the angel.
Zechariah,5,11,"He replied, “To the country of Babylon. A temple will be built for it. When the temple is ready, the basket will be set there in its place.”"
Zechariah,6,1,I looked up again and saw four chariots. They were coming out from between two mountains. The mountains were made out of bronze.
Zechariah,6,2,The first chariot was pulled by red horses. The second one had black horses.
Zechariah,6,3,The third had white horses. And the fourth had spotted horses. All the horses were powerful.
Zechariah,6,4,"I asked the angel who was talking with me, “Sir, what are these?”"
Zechariah,6,5,"The angel answered, “The four spirits of heaven. They are going out to serve the Lord of the whole world."
Zechariah,6,6,The chariot pulled by the black horses is going toward the north country. The one with the white horses is going toward the west. And the one with the spotted horses is going toward the south.”
Zechariah,6,7,"The powerful horses went out. They were in a hurry to go all over the earth. The angel said, “Go all through the earth!” So they did."
Zechariah,6,8,"Then the Lord called out to me, “Look! The horses going toward the north have given my Spirit rest in the north country.”"
Zechariah,6,9,"A message from the Lord came to me. His angel said,"
Zechariah,6,10,"“Get some silver and gold from Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah. They have just come back from Babylon. On that same day go to Josiah’s house. He is the son of Zephaniah."
Zechariah,6,11,Use the silver and gold to make a crown. Set it on the head of Joshua the high priest. He is the son of Jozadak.
Zechariah,6,12,"Give Joshua a message from the Lord who rules over all. He says, ‘Here is the man whose name is the Branch. He will branch out and build my temple."
Zechariah,6,13,That is what he will do. He will be dressed in majesty as if it were his royal robe. He will sit as king on his throne. He will also be a priest there. So he will combine the positions of king and priest in himself.’
Zechariah,6,14,"The crown will be given to Heldai, Tobijah, Jedaiah and Zephaniah’s son Hen. The crown will be kept in the Lord ’s temple. It will remind everyone that the Lord ’s promises will come true."
Zechariah,6,15,Those who are far away will come to Jerusalem. They will help build the Lord ’s temple. Then his people will know that the Lord who rules over all has sent me to them. It will happen if they are careful to obey the Lord their God.”
Zechariah,7,1,"During the fourth year that Darius was king, a message from the Lord came to me. It was the fourth day of the ninth month. That’s the month of Kislev."
Zechariah,7,2,The people of Bethel wanted to ask the Lord for his blessing. So they sent Sharezer and Regem-Melek and their men.
Zechariah,7,3,"They went to the prophets and priests at the Lord ’s temple. They asked them, “Should we mourn and go without eating in the fifth month? That’s what we’ve done for many years.”"
Zechariah,7,4,"Then the message came to me from the Lord who rules over all. He said,"
Zechariah,7,5,"“Ask the priests and all the people in the land a question for me. Say to them, ‘You mourned and fasted in the fifth and seventh months. You did it for the past 70 years. But did you really do it for me?"
Zechariah,7,6,"And when you were eating and drinking, weren’t you just enjoying good food for yourselves?"
Zechariah,7,7,Didn’t I tell you the same thing through the earlier prophets? That was when Jerusalem and the towns around it were at rest and enjoyed success. People lived in the Negev Desert and the western hills at that time.’ ”
Zechariah,7,8,Another message from the Lord came to me.
Zechariah,7,9,Here is what the Lord who rules over all said to his people. “Treat everyone with justice. Show mercy and tender concern to one another.
Zechariah,7,10,Do not take advantage of widows. Do not mistreat children whose fathers have died. Do not be mean to outsiders or poor people. Do not make evil plans against one another.”
Zechariah,7,11,But they refused to pay attention to the Lord . They were stubborn. They turned their backs and covered their ears.
Zechariah,7,12,"They made their hearts as hard as the hardest stone. They wouldn’t listen to the law. They wouldn’t pay attention to the Lord ’s messages. So the Lord who rules over all was very angry. After all, his Spirit had spoken to his people through the earlier prophets."
Zechariah,7,13,"“When I called, they did not listen,” says the Lord . “So when they called, I would not listen."
Zechariah,7,14,I used a windstorm to scatter them among all the nations. They were strangers there. The land they left behind became dry and empty. No one could even travel through it. This is how they turned the pleasant land into a dry and empty desert.”
Zechariah,8,1,"A message came to me from the Lord who rules over all. He said,"
Zechariah,8,2,"“I am very jealous for my people in Zion. In fact, I am burning with jealousy for them.”"
Zechariah,8,3,"He continued, “I will return to Zion. I will live among my people in Jerusalem. Then Jerusalem will be called the Faithful City. And my mountain will be called the Holy Mountain.”"
Zechariah,8,4,"He continued, “Once again old men and women will sit in the streets of Jerusalem. All of them will be using canes because they are old."
Zechariah,8,5,The city streets will be filled with boys and girls. They will be playing there.”
Zechariah,8,6,"He continued, “All of that might seem hard to believe to the people living then. But it will not be too hard for me.”"
Zechariah,8,7,"He continued, “I will save my people. I will gather them from the countries of the east and the west."
Zechariah,8,8,I will bring them back to live in Jerusalem. They will be my people. I will be their faithful God. I will keep my promises to them.”
Zechariah,8,9,"The Lord who rules over all says to his people, “Now listen to these words, ‘Let your hands be strong so that you can rebuild the temple.’ This also was said by the prophets Haggai and Zechariah. They spoke to you when the work on my temple began again."
Zechariah,8,10,"Before the work was started again, there was no pay for the people. And there was no money to rent animals. People could not go about their business safely because of their enemies. I had turned all of them against one another."
Zechariah,8,11,"But now I will not punish you who are living at this time. I will not treat you as I treated your people before you,” announces the Lord who rules over all."
Zechariah,8,12,“Your seeds will grow well. Your vines will bear fruit. The ground will produce crops for you. And the heavens will drop their dew on your land. I will give all these things to those who are still left alive here.
Zechariah,8,13,"Judah and Israel, in the past you have been a curse among the nations. But now I will save you. You will be a blessing to others. Do not be afraid. Let your hands be strong so that you can do my work.”"
Zechariah,8,14,"The Lord who rules over all says, “Your people of long ago made me angry. So I decided to bring trouble on them. I did not show them any pity."
Zechariah,8,15,But now I plan to do good things to Jerusalem and Judah again. So do not be afraid.
Zechariah,8,16,Here is what you must do. Speak the truth to one another. Make true and wise decisions in your courts.
Zechariah,8,17,"Do not make evil plans against one another. When you promise to tell the truth, do not lie. Many people love to do that. But I hate all these things,” announces the Lord."
Zechariah,8,18,"Another message came to me from the Lord who rules over all. He said,"
Zechariah,8,19,"“You have established special times to go without eating. They are your fasts in the fourth, fifth, seventh and tenth months. They will become days of joy. They will be happy times for Judah. It will happen if you take delight in telling the truth and bringing about peace.”"
Zechariah,8,20,"He continued, “Many nations will still come to you. And those who live in many cities will also come."
Zechariah,8,21,"The people who live in one city will go to another city. They will say, ‘Let’s go right away to ask the Lord for his blessing. Let’s look to him as our God. We ourselves are going.’"
Zechariah,8,22,Large numbers of people and nations will come to Jerusalem. They will look to me. They will ask me to bless them.”
Zechariah,8,23,"He continued, “At that time many people of all nations and languages will take hold of one Jew. They will grab hold of the hem of his robe. And they will say, ‘We want to go to Jerusalem with you. We’ve heard that God is with you.’ ”"
Zechariah,9,1,This is a prophecy. It is the Lord ’s message against the land of Hadrak. He will judge Damascus. That’s because all the tribes of Israel look to him. So do all other people.
Zechariah,9,2,The Lord will judge Hamath too. It’s next to Damascus. He will also punish Tyre and Sidon even though they are very clever.
Zechariah,9,3,Tyre’s people have built a fort for themselves. They’ve piled up silver like dust. They have as much gold as the dirt in the streets.
Zechariah,9,4,But the Lord will take away everything they have. He’ll destroy their power on the Mediterranean Sea. And Tyre will be completely burned up.
Zechariah,9,5,Ashkelon will see it and become afraid. Gaza will groan with pain. So will Ekron. Its hope will vanish. Gaza will no longer have a king. Ashkelon will be deserted.
Zechariah,9,6,"A people who come from several nations will take over Ashdod. The Lord says, “I will put an end to the pride of the Philistines."
Zechariah,9,7,They will no longer drink the blood of their animal sacrifices. I will remove the ‘unclean’ food from between their teeth. The Philistines who are left will belong to our God. They will become a family group in Judah. And Ekron will be like the Jebusites. So the Philistines will become part of Israel.
Zechariah,9,8,But I will camp at my temple. I will guard it against enemy armies. No one will ever crush my people again. I will make sure it does not happen.
Zechariah,9,9,"“City of Zion, be full of joy! People of Jerusalem, shout! See, your king comes to you. He always does what is right. He has won the victory. He is humble and riding on a donkey. He is sitting on a donkey’s colt."
Zechariah,9,10,I will take the chariots away from Ephraim. I will remove the war horses from Jerusalem. I will break the bows that are used in battle. Your king will announce peace to the nations. He will rule from ocean to ocean. His kingdom will reach from the Euphrates River to the ends of the earth.
Zechariah,9,11,I will set your prisoners free from where their enemies are keeping them. I will do it because of the blood that put into effect my covenant with you.
Zechariah,9,12,"Return to your place of safety, you prisoners who still have hope. Even now I announce that I will give you back much more than you had before."
Zechariah,9,13,"I will bend Judah as I bend my bow. I will make Ephraim’s people my arrows. Zion, I will stir up your sons. Greece, they will attack your sons. My people, I will use you as my sword.”"
Zechariah,9,14,Then the Lord will appear over his people. His arrows will flash like lightning. The Lord and King will blow the trumpet of his thunder. He’ll march out like a storm in the south.
Zechariah,9,15,The Lord who rules over all will be like a shield to his people. They will destroy their enemies. They’ll use slings to throw stones at them. They’ll drink the blood of their enemies as if it were wine. They’ll be full like the bowl that is used for sprinkling the corners of the altar.
Zechariah,9,16,The Lord their God will save his people on that day. He will be like a shepherd who saves his flock. They will gleam in his land like jewels in a crown.
Zechariah,9,17,How very beautiful they will be! Grain and fresh wine will make the young men and young women strong.
Zechariah,10,1,"People of Judah, ask the Lord to send rain in the spring. He is the one who sends the thunderstorms. He sends down showers of rain on all people. He gives everyone the plants in the fields."
Zechariah,10,2,Other gods tell lies. Those who practice magic see visions that aren’t true. They tell dreams that fool people. They give comfort that doesn’t do any good. So the people wander around like sheep. They are crushed because they don’t have a shepherd.
Zechariah,10,3,"The Lord who rules over all says, “I am very angry with the shepherds. I will punish the leaders. The Lord will take care of his flock. They are the people of Judah. He will make them like a proud horse in battle."
Zechariah,10,4,"The most important building stone will come from the tribe of Judah. The tent stake will also come from it. And the bow that is used in battle will come from it. In fact, every ruler will come from it."
Zechariah,10,5,Together they will be like warriors in battle. They will stomp their enemies into the mud of the streets. The Lord will be with them. So they will fight against the horsemen and put them to shame.
Zechariah,10,6,“I will make the family of Judah strong. I will save the tribes of Joseph. I will bring them back because I have tender love for them. It will be as if I had not sent them away. I am the Lord their God. I will help them.
Zechariah,10,7,The people of Ephraim will become like warriors. Their hearts will be glad as if they were drinking wine. Their children will see it and be filled with joy. I will make their hearts glad.
Zechariah,10,8,"I will signal for my people to come, and I will gather them in. I will set them free. There will be as many of them as before."
Zechariah,10,9,I have scattered them among the nations. But in lands far away they will remember me. They and their children will be kept alive. And they will return.
Zechariah,10,10,I will bring them back from Egypt. I will gather them from Assyria. I will bring them to Gilead and Lebanon. There will not be enough room for them.
Zechariah,10,11,They will pass through a sea of trouble. The stormy sea will calm down. All the deep places in the Nile River will dry up. Assyria’s pride will be brought down. Egypt’s right to rule will disappear.
Zechariah,10,12,"I will make my people strong. They will live in safety because of me,” announces the Lord."
Zechariah,11,1,"Lebanon, open your doors! Then fire can burn up your cedar trees."
Zechariah,11,2,"Juniper trees, cry out! The cedar trees have fallen down. The majestic trees are destroyed. Cry out, you oak trees of Bashan! The thick forest has been cut down."
Zechariah,11,3,Listen to the shepherds cry out! Their rich grasslands are destroyed. Listen to the lions roar! The trees and bushes along the Jordan River are gone.
Zechariah,11,4,"The Lord my God says, “Take care of the sheep that are set apart to be sacrificed."
Zechariah,11,5,"Those who buy them kill them. And they are not punished for it. Those who sell them say, ‘Praise the Lord ! We’re rich!’ And their own shepherds do not spare them."
Zechariah,11,6,"I will no longer have pity on the people in the land,” announces the Lord . “I will hand all of them over to their neighbors and their king. They will destroy the land. And I will not save anyone from their power.”"
Zechariah,11,7,So I took care of the sheep set apart to be sacrificed. I took special care of those that had been treated badly. Then I got two shepherd’s staffs. I called one of them Favor. I called the other one Union. And I took care of the flock.
Zechariah,11,8,"In one month I got rid of three worthless shepherds. The sheep hated me, and I got tired of them."
Zechariah,11,9,"So I said, “I won’t be your shepherd anymore. Let those of you who are dying die. Let those who are passing away pass away. Let those who are left eat one another up.”"
Zechariah,11,10,Then I got my staff called Favor. I broke it. That meant the covenant the Lord had made with all the nations was broken.
Zechariah,11,11,It happened that day. The sheep that had been treated badly were watching me. They knew it was the Lord ’s message.
Zechariah,11,12,"I told them, “If you think it is best, give me my pay. But if you don’t think so, keep it.” So they paid me 30 silver coins."
Zechariah,11,13,"The Lord said to me, “Throw those coins to the potter.” That amount shows how little they valued me! So I threw the 30 silver coins to the potter at the Lord ’s temple."
Zechariah,11,14,Then I broke my second staff called Union. That broke the family connection between Judah and Israel.
Zechariah,11,15,"The Lord said to me, “Now pretend to be a foolish shepherd. Get the things you need."
Zechariah,11,16,"I am going to raise up a shepherd over the land. He will not take care of those that are wounded. He will not look for the young ones. He will not heal those that are hurt. He will not feed the healthy ones. Instead, he will eat the best sheep. He will even tear their hooves off."
Zechariah,11,17,“How terrible it will be for that worthless shepherd! He deserts the flock. May a sword strike his arm and his right eye! May his powerful arm become weak! May his right eye be totally blinded!”
Zechariah,12,1,"This is a prophecy. It is the Lord ’s message about Israel. The Lord spreads out the heavens. He lays the foundation of the earth. He creates the human spirit within a person. He says,"
Zechariah,12,2,“Jerusalem will be like a cup in my hand. It will make all the surrounding nations drunk from the wine of my anger. Judah will be attacked by its enemies. So will Jerusalem.
Zechariah,12,3,At that time all the nations on earth will gather together against Jerusalem. Then it will become like a rock that can’t be moved. All the nations that try to move it will only hurt themselves.
Zechariah,12,4,"On that day I will fill every horse with panic. I will make every rider crazy,” announces the Lord . “I will watch over the people of Judah. But I will make all the horses of the nations blind."
Zechariah,12,5,"Then the family groups of Judah will say in their hearts, ‘The people of Jerusalem are strong. That’s because the Lord who rules over all is their God.’"
Zechariah,12,6,“At that time Judah’s family groups will be like a fire pot in a pile of wood. They will be like a burning torch among bundles of grain. They will destroy all the surrounding nations on every side. But Jerusalem will remain unharmed in its place.
Zechariah,12,7,“I will save the houses in Judah first. The honor of David’s family line is great. So is the honor of those who live in Jerusalem. But their honor will not be greater than the honor of the rest of Judah.
Zechariah,12,8,At that time I will be like a shield to those who live in Jerusalem. Then even the weakest among them will be great warriors like David. And David’s family line will be like the angel of the Lord who leads them.
Zechariah,12,9,On that day I will begin to destroy all the nations that attack Jerusalem.
Zechariah,12,10,“I will pour out a spirit of grace and prayer on David’s family line. I will also send it on those who live in Jerusalem. They will look to me. I am the one they have pierced. They will mourn over me as someone mourns over an only child who has died. They will be full of sorrow over me. Their sorrow will be just like someone’s sorrow over an oldest son.
Zechariah,12,11,At that time there will be a lot of weeping in Jerusalem. It will be as great as the weeping of the people at Hadad Rimmon. Hadad Rimmon is in the valley of Megiddo. They were weeping over Josiah’s death.
Zechariah,12,12,"Everyone in the land will mourn. Each family will mourn by themselves and their wives by themselves. That will include the family lines of David, Nathan,"
Zechariah,12,13,"Levi, Shimei and"
Zechariah,12,14,all the others.
Zechariah,13,1,“At that time a fountain will be opened for the benefit of David’s family line. It will also bless the others who live in Jerusalem. It will wash away their sins. It will make them pure and ‘clean.’
Zechariah,13,2,"“On that day I will remove the names of other gods from the land. They will not even be remembered anymore,” announces the Lord who rules over all. “I will drive the evil prophets out of the land. I will get rid of the spirit that put lies in their mouths."
Zechariah,13,3,"Some people might still prophesy. But their own fathers and mothers will speak to them. They will tell them, ‘You must die. You have told lies in the Lord ’s name.’ When they prophesy, their own parents will stab them."
Zechariah,13,4,“At that time every prophet will be ashamed of the vision they see. They will no longer pretend to be a true prophet. They will not put on clothes that are made out of hair in order to trick people.
Zechariah,13,5,"In fact, each one will say, ‘I’m not really a prophet. I’m a farmer. I’ve farmed the land since I was young.’"
Zechariah,13,6,"Suppose someone asks, ‘What are these wounds on your body?’ Then they will answer, ‘I was given these wounds at the house of my friends.’"
Zechariah,13,7,"“My sword, wake up! Attack my shepherd! Attack the man who is close to me,” announces the Lord who rules over all. “Strike down the shepherd. Then the sheep will be scattered. And I will turn my hand against their little ones."
Zechariah,13,8,"Here is what will happen in the whole land,” announces the Lord. “Two-thirds of the people will be struck down and die. But one-third will be left."
Zechariah,13,9,"I will put this third in the fire. I will make them as pure as silver. I will test them like gold. They will call out to me. And I will answer them. I will say, ‘They are my people.’ And they will say, ‘The Lord is our God.’ ”"
Zechariah,14,1,"The day of the Lord is coming, Jerusalem. At that time your enemies will steal everything your people own. They will divide it up within your walls."
Zechariah,14,2,The Lord will gather all the nations together. They will fight against Jerusalem. They’ll capture the city. Its houses will be robbed. Its women will be raped. Half of the people will be taken away as prisoners. But the rest of them won’t be taken.
Zechariah,14,3,Then the Lord will march out and fight against those nations. He will fight as on a day of battle.
Zechariah,14,4,On that day he will stand on the Mount of Olives. It’s east of Jerusalem. It will be split in two from east to west. Half of the mountain will move north. The other half will move south. A large valley will be formed.
Zechariah,14,5,The people will run away through that mountain valley. It will reach all the way to Azel. They’ll run away just as they ran from the earthquake when Uzziah was king of Judah. Then the Lord my God will come. All the holy ones will come with him.
Zechariah,14,6,"There won’t be any sunlight on that day. There will be no cold, frosty darkness either."
Zechariah,14,7,"It will be a day unlike any other. It will be a day known only to the Lord . It won’t be separated into day and night. After that day is over, there will be light again."
Zechariah,14,8,At that time water that gives life will flow out from Jerusalem. Half of it will run east into the Dead Sea. The other half will go west to the Mediterranean Sea. The water will flow in summer and winter.
Zechariah,14,9,The Lord will be king over the whole earth. On that day there will be one Lord . His name will be the only name.
Zechariah,14,10,The whole land south of Jerusalem will be changed. From Geba to Rimmon it will become like the Arabah Valley. But Jerusalem will be raised up high. It will be raised from the Benjamin Gate to the First Gate to the Corner Gate. It will be raised from the Tower of Hananel to the royal winepresses. And it will remain in its place.
Zechariah,14,11,People will live in it. Jerusalem will never be destroyed again. It will be secure.
Zechariah,14,12,The Lord will punish all the nations that fought against Jerusalem. He’ll strike them with a plague. It will make their bodies rot while they are still standing on their feet. Their eyes will rot in their heads. Their tongues will rot in their mouths.
Zechariah,14,13,On that day the Lord will fill people with great panic. They will grab one another by the hand. And they’ll attack one another.
Zechariah,14,14,"Judah will also fight at Jerusalem. The wealth of all the surrounding nations will be collected. Huge amounts of gold, silver and clothes will be gathered up."
Zechariah,14,15,"The same kind of plague will strike the horses, mules, camels and donkeys. In fact, it will strike all the animals in the army camps."
Zechariah,14,16,But some people from all the nations that have attacked Jerusalem will still be left alive. All of them will go up there to worship the King. He is the Lord who rules over all. Year after year these people will celebrate the Feast of Booths.
Zechariah,14,17,"Some nations might not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King. If they don’t, they won’t have any rain."
Zechariah,14,18,The people of Egypt might not go up there to take part. Then they won’t have any rain either. That’s the plague the Lord will send on the nations that don’t go to celebrate the Feast of Booths.
Zechariah,14,19,Egypt will be punished. So will all the other nations that don’t celebrate the feast.
Zechariah,14,20,On that day “Holy to the Lord ” will be carved on the bells of the horses. The cooking pots in the Lord ’s temple will be just like the sacred bowls in front of the altar for burnt offerings.
Zechariah,14,21,Every pot in Jerusalem and Judah will be set apart to the Lord . All those who come to offer sacrifices will get some of the pots and cook in them. At that time there won’t be any Canaanites in the Lord ’s temple. He is the Lord who rules over all.
