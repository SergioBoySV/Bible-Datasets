Nehemiah,1,1,These are the words of Nehemiah. He was the son of Hakaliah. I was in the fort of Susa. I was there in the 20th year that Artaxerxes was king. It was in the month of Kislev.
Nehemiah,1,2,At that time Hanani came from Judah with some other men. He was one of my brothers. I asked him and the other men about the Jews who were left alive in Judah. They had returned from Babylon. I also asked him about Jerusalem.
Nehemiah,1,3,"He and the men with him said to me, “Some of the people who returned are still alive. They are back in the land of Judah. But they are having a hard time. They are ashamed. The wall of Jerusalem is broken down. Its gates have been burned with fire.”"
Nehemiah,1,4,"When I heard about these things, I sat down and wept. For several days I was very sad. I didn’t eat any food. And I prayed to the God of heaven."
Nehemiah,1,5,"I said, “ Lord , you are the God of heaven. You are a great and wonderful God. You keep the covenant you made with those who love you and obey your commandments. You show them your love."
Nehemiah,1,6,Please pay careful attention to my prayer. See how your people are suffering. Please listen to me. I’m praying to you day and night. I’m praying for the people of Israel. We Israelites have committed sins against you. All of us admit it. I and my family have also sinned against you.
Nehemiah,1,7,"We’ve done some very evil things. We haven’t obeyed the commands, rules and laws you gave your servant Moses."
Nehemiah,1,8,"“Remember what you told him. You said, ‘If you people are not faithful, I will scatter you among the nations."
Nehemiah,1,9,"But if you return to me, I will bring you back. If you obey my commands, I will gather you together again. I will bring you back from the farthest places on earth. I will bring you to the special place where I have chosen to put my Name.’"
Nehemiah,1,10,"“ Lord , they are your people. They serve you. You used your great strength and mighty hand to set them free from Egypt."
Nehemiah,1,11,"Lord, please pay careful attention to my prayer. Listen to the prayers of all of us. We take delight in bringing honor to your name. Give me success today when I bring my request to King Artaxerxes.” I was the king’s wine taster."
Nehemiah,2,1,Wine was brought in for King Artaxerxes. It was the month of Nisan in the 20th year of his rule. I got the wine and gave it to him. I hadn’t been sad in front of him before. But now I was.
Nehemiah,2,2,"So the king asked me, “Why are you looking so sad? You aren’t sick. You must be feeling very sad.” I was really afraid."
Nehemiah,2,3,"But I said to the king, “May you live forever! Why shouldn’t I look sad? The city where my people of long ago are buried has been destroyed. And fire has burned up its gates.”"
Nehemiah,2,4,"The king said to me, “What do you want?” I prayed to the God of heaven."
Nehemiah,2,5,"Then I answered the king, “Are you pleased with me, King Artaxerxes? If it pleases you, send me to Judah. Let me go to the city of Jerusalem. That’s where my people are buried. I want to rebuild it.”"
Nehemiah,2,6,"The queen was sitting beside the king. He turned and asked me, “How long will your journey take? When will you get back?” It pleased the king to send me. So I chose a certain time."
Nehemiah,2,7,"I also said to him, “If it pleases you, may I take some letters with me? I want to give them to the governors of the land west of the Euphrates River. Then they’ll help me travel safely through their territory until I arrive in Judah."
Nehemiah,2,8,May I also have a letter to Asaph? He takes care of the royal park. I want him to give me some logs so I can make beams out of them. I want to use them for the gates of the fort that is by the temple. Some of the logs will also be used in the city wall. And I’ll need some for the house I’m going to live in.” God was kind to me and helped me. So the king gave me what I asked for.
Nehemiah,2,9,Then I went to the governors of the land west of the Euphrates River. I gave them the king’s letters. He had also sent army officers and horsemen along with me.
Nehemiah,2,10,Sanballat and Tobiah heard about what was happening. Sanballat was a Horonite. Tobiah was an official from Ammon. They were very upset that someone had come to help the Israelites.
Nehemiah,2,11,I went to Jerusalem and stayed there for three days.
Nehemiah,2,12,Then at night I took a few other people with me to check out the walls. I hadn’t told anyone what my God wanted me to do for Jerusalem. There weren’t any donkeys with me except the one I was riding on.
Nehemiah,2,13,That night I went out through the Valley Gate. I went toward the Jackal Well and the Dung Gate. I checked out the walls of Jerusalem. They had been broken down. I also checked the city gates. Fire had burned them up.
Nehemiah,2,14,I moved on toward the Fountain Gate and the King’s Pool. But there wasn’t enough room for my donkey to get through.
Nehemiah,2,15,"It was still night. I went up the Kidron Valley. I kept checking the wall. Finally, I turned back. I went back in through the Valley Gate."
Nehemiah,2,16,The officials didn’t know where I had gone or what I had done. That’s because I hadn’t said anything to anyone yet. I hadn’t told the priests or nobles or officials. And I hadn’t spoken to any other Jews who would be rebuilding the wall.
Nehemiah,2,17,"I said to them, “You can see the trouble we’re in. Jerusalem has been destroyed. Fire has burned up its gates. Come on. Let’s rebuild the wall of Jerusalem. Then people won’t be ashamed anymore.”"
Nehemiah,2,18,"I also told them how my gracious God was helping me. And I told them what the king had said to me. They replied, “Let’s start rebuilding.” So they began that good work."
Nehemiah,2,19,"But Sanballat, the Horonite, heard about it. So did Tobiah, the official from Ammon. Geshem, the Arab, heard about it too. All of them laughed at us. They made fun of us. “What do you think you are doing?” they asked. “Are you turning against the king?”"
Nehemiah,2,20,"I answered, “The God of heaven will give us success. We serve him. So we’ll start rebuilding the walls. But you don’t have any share in Jerusalem. You don’t have any claim to it. You don’t have any right to worship here.”"
Nehemiah,3,1,Eliashib the high priest and the other priests went to work. They rebuilt the Sheep Gate. They set it apart to God. They put its doors in place. They continued to rebuild the wall up to the Tower of the Hundred. They set the tower apart to God. Then they continued to rebuild the wall all the way to the Tower of Hananel.

Nehemiah,4,1,Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall. So he became very angry and upset. He made fun of the Jews.
Nehemiah,4,2,"He spoke to his friends and the army of Samaria. He said, “What are those Jews trying to do? Can they make their city wall like new again? Will they offer sacrifices? Can they finish everything in a single day? The stones from their city wall and buildings are piled up like trash. And everything has been badly burned. Can they use those stones to rebuild everything again?”"
Nehemiah,4,3,"Tobiah from Ammon was at Sanballat’s side. He said, “What are they building? They’re putting up a stone wall. But suppose a fox climbs on top of it. Even that will break it down!”"
Nehemiah,4,4,"I prayed to God. I said, “Our God, please listen to our prayer. Some people hate us. They’re saying bad things about us. So let others say bad things about them. Let them be carried off like stolen goods. Let them be taken to another country as prisoners."
Nehemiah,4,5,Don’t hide your eyes from their guilt. Don’t forgive their sins. They have said bad things about the builders.”
Nehemiah,4,6,So we rebuilt the wall. We repaired it until all of it was half as high as we wanted it to be. The people worked with all their heart.
Nehemiah,4,7,"But Sanballat and Tobiah heard that Jerusalem’s walls continued to be repaired. The Arabs, the Ammonites and the people of Ashdod heard about it too. They heard that the gaps in the wall were being filled in. So they were very angry."
Nehemiah,4,8,All of them made evil plans to come and fight against Jerusalem. They wanted to stir up trouble against it.
Nehemiah,4,9,But we prayed to our God. We put guards on duty day and night to watch out for danger.
Nehemiah,4,10,"During that time, the people in Judah spoke up. They said, “The workers are getting weaker and weaker all the time. Broken stones are piled up everywhere. They are in our way. So we can’t rebuild the wall.”"
Nehemiah,4,11,"And our enemies said, “We will be right there among them. We’ll kill them. We’ll put an end to their work. We’ll do it before they even know it or see us.”"
Nehemiah,4,12,"Then the Jews who lived near our enemies came to us. They told us ten times, “No matter where you are, they’ll attack us.”"
Nehemiah,4,13,"So I stationed some people behind the lowest parts of the wall. That’s where our enemies could easily attack us. I stationed the people family by family. They had their swords, spears and bows with them."
Nehemiah,4,14,"I looked things over. Then I stood up and spoke to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people. I said, “Don’t be afraid of your enemies. Remember the Lord. He is great and powerful. So fight for your families. Fight for your sons and daughters. Fight for your wives and homes.”"
Nehemiah,4,15,Our enemies heard that we knew what they were trying to do. They heard that God had blocked their evil plans. So all of us returned to the wall. Each of us did our own work.
Nehemiah,4,16,"From that day on, half of my men did the work. The other half were given spears, shields, bows and armor. The officers stationed themselves behind all the people of Judah."
Nehemiah,4,17,The people continued to build the wall. The people who carried supplies did their work with one hand. They held a weapon in the other hand.
Nehemiah,4,18,Each of the builders wore his sword at his side as he worked. But the man who blew the trumpet stayed with me.
Nehemiah,4,19,"Then I spoke to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people. I said, “This is a big job. It covers a lot of territory. We’re separated too far from one another along the wall."
Nehemiah,4,20,"When you hear the sound of the trumpet, join us at that location. Our God will fight for us!”"
Nehemiah,4,21,So we continued the work. Half of the men held spears. We worked from the first light of sunrise until the stars came out at night.
Nehemiah,4,22,"At that time I also spoke to the people. I told them, “Have every man and his helper stay inside Jerusalem at night. Then they can guard us at night. And they can work during the day.”"
Nehemiah,4,23,"My relatives and I didn’t take off our clothes. My men and the guards didn’t take theirs off either. Each man kept his weapon with him, even when he went to get water."
Nehemiah,5,1,Some men and their wives cried out against their Jewish brothers and sisters.
Nehemiah,5,2,"Some of them were saying, “There are now many of us. We have many sons and daughters. We have to get some grain so we can eat and stay alive.”"
Nehemiah,5,3,"Others were saying, “We’re being forced to sell our fields, vineyards and homes. We have to do it to buy grain. There isn’t enough food for everyone.”"
Nehemiah,5,4,"Still others were saying, “We’ve had to borrow money. We needed it to pay the king’s tax on our fields and vineyards."
Nehemiah,5,5,We belong to the same family lines as the rest of our people. Our children are as good as theirs. But we’ve had to sell them off as slaves. Some of our daughters have already been made slaves. But we can’t do anything about it. That’s because our fields and vineyards now belong to others.”
Nehemiah,5,6,I heard them when they cried out. And I was very angry when I heard what they were saying.
Nehemiah,5,7,"I thought it over for a while. Then I accused the nobles and officials of breaking the law. I told them, “You are charging your own people interest!” So I called together a large group of people to handle the matter."
Nehemiah,5,8,"I said, “Our Jewish brothers and sisters were sold to other nations. We’ve done everything we could to buy them back and bring them home. But look at what you are doing! You are actually selling your own people! Now we’ll have to buy them back too!” The people kept quiet. They couldn’t think of anything to say."
Nehemiah,5,9,"So I continued, “What you are doing isn’t right. Shouldn’t you show respect for our God? Shouldn’t you live in a way that will keep our enemies from saying bad things about us?"
Nehemiah,5,10,I’m lending the people money and grain. So are my relatives and my men. But we must stop charging interest!
Nehemiah,5,11,"Give the people’s fields back to them. Give them back their vineyards, olive groves and houses. Do it right away. Give everything back to them. Also give them back the one percent on the money, grain, fresh wine and olive oil you have charged them.”"
Nehemiah,5,12,"“We’ll give it back,” they said. “And we won’t require anything more from them. We’ll do exactly as you say.” Then I sent for the priests. I made the nobles and officials promise to do what they had said."
Nehemiah,5,13,"I also shook out my pockets and emptied them. I said, “Someone might decide not to keep this promise they have made. If that happens, may God shake them out of their house! May he empty them of everything they own!” The whole community said, “Amen.” They praised the Lord . And the leaders did what they had promised to do."
Nehemiah,5,14,"And that’s not all. I was appointed as governor of Judah in the 20th year that Artaxerxes was king of Persia. I remained in that position until his 32nd year. During those 12 years, I and my relatives didn’t eat the food that was provided for my table."
Nehemiah,5,15,"But there had been governors before me. They had put a heavy load on the people. They had taken a pound of silver from each of them. They had also taken food and wine from them. Their officials had acted like high and mighty rulers over them. But because of my great respect for God, I didn’t act like that."
Nehemiah,5,16,"Instead, I spent all my time working on this wall. All my men were gathered there to work on it too. We didn’t receive any land for ourselves."
Nehemiah,5,17,Many people ate at my table. They included 150 Jews and officials. They also included leaders who came to us from the nations that were around us.
Nehemiah,5,18,"Each day one ox, six of the best sheep and some birds were prepared for me. Every ten days plenty of wine of all kinds was brought in as well. In spite of all that, I never asked for the food that was provided for my table. That’s because the people were already paying too many taxes."
Nehemiah,5,19,You are my God. Please remember me and help me. Keep in mind everything I’ve done for these people.
Nehemiah,6,1,"Sanballat, Tobiah and Geshem, the Arab, heard about what I had done. So did the rest of our enemies. All of them heard I had rebuilt the wall. In fact, they heard there weren’t any gaps left in it. But up to that time I hadn’t put up the gates at the main entrances to the city."
Nehemiah,6,2,"Sanballat and Geshem sent me a message. They said, “Come. Let’s talk with one another. Let’s meet in one of the villages on the plain of Ono.” But they were planning to harm me."
Nehemiah,6,3,"So I sent messengers to them with my answer. I replied, “I’m working on a huge project. So I can’t get away. Why should the work stop while I leave it? Why should I go down and talk with you?”"
Nehemiah,6,4,They sent me the same message four times. And I gave them the same answer each time.
Nehemiah,6,5,Sanballat sent his helper to me a fifth time. He brought the same message. He was carrying a letter that wasn’t sealed.
Nehemiah,6,6,"It said, “A report is going around among the nations. Geshem says it’s true. We hear that you and the other Jews are planning to turn against the Persian rulers. And that’s why you are building the wall. It’s also reported that you are about to become their king."
Nehemiah,6,7,"People say that you have even appointed prophets to make an announcement about you. In Jerusalem they are going to say, ‘Judah has a king!’ That report will get back to the king of Persia. So come. Let’s meet together.”"
Nehemiah,6,8,"I sent a reply to Sanballat. I said, “What you are saying isn’t really happening. You are just making it up.”"
Nehemiah,6,9,"All of them were trying to frighten us. They thought, “Their hands will get too weak to do the work. So it won’t be completed.” But I prayed to God. I said, “Make my hands stronger.”"
Nehemiah,6,10,"One day I went to Shemaiah’s house. He was the son of Delaiah. Delaiah was the son of Mehetabel. Shemaiah had shut himself up in his home. He said, “Let’s go to God’s house. Let’s meet inside the temple and close the doors. Some men are coming at night to kill you.”"
Nehemiah,6,11,"But I said, “Should a man like me run away? Should someone like me go into the temple just to save his life? No! I won’t go!”"
Nehemiah,6,12,I realized that God hadn’t sent Shemaiah. Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. That’s why he had prophesied lies about me.
Nehemiah,6,13,They had hired him to scare me. They wanted me to commit a sin by doing what he said. That would give me a bad name in the community. People would find fault with me and my work.
Nehemiah,6,14,You are my God. Remember what Tobiah and Sanballat have done. Also remember the prophet Noadiah. She and the rest of the prophets have been trying to scare me.
Nehemiah,6,15,So the city wall was completed on the 25th day of the month of Elul. It was finished in 52 days.
Nehemiah,6,16,All our enemies heard about it. All the nations around us became afraid. They weren’t sure of themselves anymore. They realized that our God had helped us finish the work.
Nehemiah,6,17,In those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah. And replies from Tobiah came back to them.
Nehemiah,6,18,Many people in Judah had promised that they would be faithful to him. That’s because he was Shekaniah’s son-in-law. Shekaniah was the son of Arah. Tobiah’s son Jehohanan had married Meshullam’s daughter. Meshullam was the son of Berekiah.
Nehemiah,6,19,Tobiah’s friends kept reporting to me the good things he did. They also kept telling him what I said. And Tobiah himself sent letters to scare me.
Nehemiah,7,1,The wall had been rebuilt. I had put up the gates at the main entrances to the city. The people who guarded the gates were appointed to their positions. So were the musicians and the Levites.
Nehemiah,7,2,I put my brother Hanani in charge of Jerusalem. Hananiah helped him. Hananiah was commander of the fort that was by the temple. Hanani was an honest man. He had more respect for God than most people do.
Nehemiah,7,3,"I said to Hanani and Hananiah, “Don’t open the gates of Jerusalem until the hottest time of the day. Tell the men who guard the gates to shut them before they go off duty. Make sure they lock them up tight. Also appoint as guards some people who live in Jerusalem. Station some of them at their appointed places. Station others near their own homes.”"
Nehemiah,7,4,Jerusalem was large. It had a lot of room. But only a few people lived there. The houses hadn’t been rebuilt yet.
Nehemiah,7,5,So my God gave me the idea and encouraged me to gather the people together. He also encouraged me to gather the nobles and officials together with them. He wanted me to list them by families. I found the family history of those who had been the first to return. Here is what I found written in it.
Nehemiah,7,6,Nebuchadnezzar had taken many Jews away from the land of Judah. He had forced them to go to Babylon as prisoners. Now they returned to Jerusalem and Judah. All of them went back to their own towns. Nebuchadnezzar was king of Babylon.

Nehemiah,8,16,So the people went out and brought back some branches. They built themselves booths on their own roofs. They made them in their courtyards. They put them up in the courtyards of the house of God. They built them in the open area in front of the Water Gate. And they built them in the open area in front of the Gate of Ephraim.

Nehemiah,9,12,By day you led the Israelites with a pillar of cloud. At night you led them with a pillar of fire. It gave them light to show them the way you wanted them to go.

Nehemiah,9,16,“But our people before us became proud and stubborn. They didn’t obey your commands.
Nehemiah,9,17,"They refused to listen to you. They forgot the miracles you had done among them. So they became stubborn. When they refused to obey you, they appointed a leader for themselves. They wanted to go back to being slaves in Egypt. But you are a God who forgives. You are gracious. You are tender and kind. You are slow to get angry. You are full of love. So you didn’t desert them."
Nehemiah,9,18,"They made for themselves a metal statue of a god that looked like a calf. They said to one another, ‘Here is your god. He brought you up out of Egypt.’ And they did evil things that dishonored you. But you still didn’t desert them."
Nehemiah,9,19,"“Because you loved them so much, you didn’t leave them in the desert. During the day the pillar of cloud didn’t stop guiding them on their path. At night the pillar of fire didn’t stop shining on the way you wanted them to go."
Nehemiah,9,20,You gave them your good Spirit to teach them. You didn’t hold back your manna from their mouths. And you gave them water when they were thirsty.

Nehemiah,9,22,“You gave them kingdoms and nations. You even gave them lands far away. They took over the country of Sihon. He was the king of Heshbon. They also took over the country of Og. He was the king of Bashan.
Nehemiah,9,23,You gave them as many children as there are stars in the sky. You told their parents to enter the land. You told them to take it over. And you brought their children into it.
Nehemiah,9,24,Their children went into the land. They took it as their own. You brought the Canaanites under Israel’s control. The Canaanites lived in the land. But you handed them over to Israel. You also handed over their kings and the other nations in the land to Israel. You allowed Israel to deal with them just as they wanted to.
Nehemiah,9,25,"Your people captured cities that had high walls around them. They also took over the rich land in Canaan. They took houses filled with all kinds of good things. They took over wells that had already been dug. They took many vineyards, olive groves and fruit trees. They ate until they were very full and satisfied. They were filled with joy because you were so good to them."
Nehemiah,9,26,"“But they didn’t obey you. Instead, they turned against you. They turned their backs on your law. They killed your prophets. The prophets had warned them to return to you. But they did very evil things that dishonored you."
Nehemiah,9,27,"So you handed them over to their enemies, who treated them badly. Then they cried out to you. From heaven you heard them. You loved them very much. So you sent leaders to help them. The leaders saved them from the power of their enemies."
Nehemiah,9,28,"“Then the people were enjoying peace and rest again. That’s when they did what you did not want them to do. Then you handed them over to their enemies. So their enemies ruled over them. When they cried out to you again, you heard them from heaven. You loved them very much. So you saved them time after time."
Nehemiah,9,29,"“You warned them so that they would obey your law again. But they became proud. They didn’t obey your commands. They sinned against your rules. You said, ‘Anyone who obeys my rules will live by them.’ But the people didn’t care about that. They turned their backs on you. They became very stubborn. They refused to listen to you."
Nehemiah,9,30,"For many years you put up with them. By your Spirit you warned them through your prophets. In spite of that, they didn’t pay any attention. So you handed them over to the nations that were around them."
Nehemiah,9,31,But you loved them very much. So you didn’t put an end to them. You didn’t desert them. That’s because you are a gracious God. You are tender and kind.
Nehemiah,9,32,"“Our God, you are the great God. You are mighty and wonderful. You keep the covenant you made with us. You show us your love. So don’t let all our suffering seem like a small thing to you. We’ve suffered greatly. So have our kings and leaders. So have our priests and prophets. Our people who lived long ago also suffered. And all your people are suffering right now. In fact, we’ve been suffering from the time of the kings of Assyria until today."
Nehemiah,9,33,"In spite of everything that has happened to us, you have been fair. You have been faithful in what you have done. But we did what was evil."
Nehemiah,9,34,Our kings and leaders didn’t follow your law. Our priests and our people before us didn’t follow it either. They didn’t pay any attention to your commands or rules that you warned them to keep.
Nehemiah,9,35,They didn’t serve you. They didn’t turn from their evil ways. They didn’t obey you even when they had a kingdom. You were very good to them. And they enjoyed it. You gave them a rich land. It had plenty of room in it. But they still didn’t serve you.
Nehemiah,9,36,“Now look at us. We are slaves today. We’re slaves in the land you gave our people of long ago. You gave it to them so they could eat its fruit and the other good things it produces.
Nehemiah,9,37,But we have sinned against you. So its great harvest goes to the kings of Persia. You have placed them over us. They rule over our bodies and cattle just as they please. And we are suffering terribly.

They were brought to Jerusalem to celebrate that happy occasion. They celebrated the fact that the wall was being set apart to God. They did it by singing and giving their thanks to him. They celebrated by playing music on cymbals, harps and lyres."
Nehemiah,12,28,The musicians were also brought together. Some of them came in from the area around Jerusalem. Others came from the villages where the people of Netophah lived.
Nehemiah,12,29,Others came from Beth Gilgal. Still others came from the area of Geba and Azmaveth. The musicians had built villages for themselves around Jerusalem.
Nehemiah,12,30,"The priests and Levites made themselves pure. Then they made the people, the gates and the wall pure and “clean.”"
Nehemiah,12,31,"I, Nehemiah, had the leaders of Judah go up on top of the wall. I also appointed two large choirs to sing and give thanks. I told one of them to walk south on top of the wall. That was toward the Dung Gate."
Nehemiah,12,32,Hoshaiah and half of the leaders of Judah followed them.
Nehemiah,12,33,"Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam,"

That’s what David, the man of God, had ordered. Ezra led the group that was marching south. He was the teacher of the Law."
Nehemiah,12,37,At the Fountain Gate they continued straight up the steps of the City of David. The steps went up to the wall. Then the group passed above the place where David’s palace had been. They continued on to the Water Gate on the east.
Nehemiah,12,38,The second choir went north. I followed them on top of the wall. Half of the people went with me. They went past the Tower of the Ovens. They went to the Broad Wall.
Nehemiah,12,39,They marched over the Gate of Ephraim. They went over the Jeshanah Gate and the Fish Gate. They went past the Tower of Hananel and the Tower of the Hundred. They continued on to the Sheep Gate. At the Gate of the Guard they stopped.
Nehemiah,12,40,Then the two choirs that sang and gave thanks took their places in God’s house. So did I. So did half of the officials.
Nehemiah,12,41,"And so did the priests. They were Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah and Hananiah. They had their trumpets with them."
Nehemiah,12,42,"Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malkijah, Elam and Ezer were also there. The choirs sang under the direction of Jezrahiah."
Nehemiah,12,43,On that day large numbers of sacrifices were offered. The people were glad because God had given them great joy. The women and children were also very happy. The joyful sound in Jerusalem could be heard far away.
Nehemiah,12,44,At that time some men were put in charge of the storerooms. That’s where all the gifts the people brought were placed. Those gifts included the first shares of their crops. They also included a tenth of everything the Law required. Crops were harvested from the fields around the towns. The people had to bring the shares of those crops that were required by the Law. They gave them to the priests and Levites. That’s because the people of Judah were pleased with the priests and Levites who were serving God.
Nehemiah,12,45,The priests and Levites did everything their God wanted them to do. They made things pure and “clean.” The musicians and the men who guarded the temple gates also served God. Everything was done just as David and his son Solomon had commanded.
Nehemiah,12,46,A long time ago there had been directors for the musicians. There had also been directors for the songs for giving thanks and praise to God. It was in the time of David and Asaph.
Nehemiah,12,47,"So now in the days of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah, all the people of Israel brought their gifts. They gave the musicians and the men who guarded the gates what they were supposed to give them every day. They also set apart the shares for the other Levites. And the Levites set apart the shares for the priests in the family line of Aaron."
Nehemiah,13,1,At that time the Book of Moses was read out loud. All the people heard it. It was written there that no Ammonite or Moabite could ever become a member of God’s community.
Nehemiah,13,2,"That’s because they hadn’t given the people of Israel food and water. Instead, they had hired Balaam to put a curse on them. But our God turned the curse into a blessing."
Nehemiah,13,3,"When that law was read, the people of Judah obeyed it. They sent out of Israel everyone who was from another nation."
Nehemiah,13,4,Eliashib the priest had been put in charge of the storerooms in the house of our God. He had worked closely with Tobiah.
Nehemiah,13,5,"He had also provided a large room for Tobiah. It had been used to store the grain offerings. The incense and the objects for the temple had been put there. And a tenth of the grain, olive oil and fresh wine had been kept there. That’s what the Law required for the Levites. That’s also what it required for the musicians and the men who guarded the temple gates. The gifts for the priests had been kept there too."
Nehemiah,13,6,"But I wasn’t in Jerusalem while all of that was going on. I had returned to the Persian King Artaxerxes, the king of Babylon. I went to him in the 32nd year of his rule. Some time later I asked him to let me return to Jerusalem."
Nehemiah,13,7,"When I got back, I learned about the evil thing Eliashib had done. He had provided a room for Tobiah. It was in the courtyards of God’s house."
Nehemiah,13,8,So I was very unhappy. I threw all of Tobiah’s things out of the room.
Nehemiah,13,9,I gave orders to make the rooms pure and “clean” again. Then I put the supplies from God’s house back into them. That included the grain offerings and the incense.
Nehemiah,13,10,I also learned that the shares the Levites were supposed to receive hadn’t been given to them. So all the Levites and musicians had to leave their regular temple duties. They had to go back and farm their own fields.
Nehemiah,13,11,"I gave a warning to the officials. I asked them, “Why aren’t you taking care of God’s house?” Then I brought the Levites and musicians together. I stationed them in their proper places. I put them back to work."
Nehemiah,13,12,"All the people of Judah brought a tenth of the grain, olive oil and fresh wine. They took it to the storerooms."
Nehemiah,13,13,"I put some men in charge of the storerooms. They were Shelemiah, Zadok and Pedaiah. Shelemiah was a priest. Zadok was a teacher of the law. And Pedaiah was a Levite. I made Hanan their assistant. He was the son of Zakkur. Zakkur was the son of Mattaniah. I knew that these men could be trusted. They were put in charge of handing out the supplies to the other Levites."
Nehemiah,13,14,You are my God. Remember me because of what I’ve done. I’ve worked faithfully for your temple and its services. So please don’t forget the good things I’ve done.
Nehemiah,13,15,"In those days I saw some people of Judah stomping on grapes in winepresses. They were doing it on the Sabbath day. Other people were bringing in grain. They were loading it on donkeys. Still other people were loading up wine, grapes, figs and other kinds of things. They were bringing all of it into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. So I warned them not to sell food on that day."
Nehemiah,13,16,"People from Tyre who lived in Jerusalem were bringing in fish. In fact, they were bringing in all kinds of goods. They were selling them in Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. The people of Judah were buying them."
Nehemiah,13,17,"I gave a warning to the nobles of Judah. I said, “Why are you doing such an evil thing? You are misusing the Sabbath day!"
Nehemiah,13,18,Your people of long ago did the very same things. That’s why our God has brought all this trouble on us. That’s why he’s making this city suffer so much. Now you are making him even angrier against Israel. You are misusing the Sabbath day.”
Nehemiah,13,19,Evening shadows fell on the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath day started. So I ordered the gates to be shut. They had to remain closed until the Sabbath day was over. I stationed some of my own men at the gates. I told them not to let anything be brought in on the Sabbath day.
Nehemiah,13,20,Once or twice some traders and sellers spent the night outside Jerusalem. They were hoping to sell all kinds of goods.
Nehemiah,13,21,"But I gave them a warning. I said, “Why are you spending the night by the wall? If you do this again, I’ll arrest you.” So from that time on they didn’t come on the Sabbath day anymore."
Nehemiah,13,22,I commanded the Levites to make themselves pure. Then I told them to go and guard the gates. I wanted the Sabbath day to be kept holy. You are my God. Remember me because of the good things I’ve done. Be kind to me according to your great love.
Nehemiah,13,23,In those days I also saw that some men of Judah had married women from Ashdod. Others had married women from Ammon or Moab.
Nehemiah,13,24,Half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod. Or they spoke the language of one of the other nations. They didn’t even know how to speak the language of Judah.
Nehemiah,13,25,"So I gave them a warning. I cursed them. I beat up some of them. I pulled their hair out. I had them make a promise in God’s name. I said, “You must promise not to give your daughters to be married to their sons. You must promise not to let their daughters marry your sons. And you must not marry their daughters either."
Nehemiah,13,26,"That’s how Solomon, the king of Israel, sinned. He married women from other nations. There wasn’t a king like him anywhere. His God loved him. In fact, God made him king over the whole nation of Israel. But even he was led into sin by women from other lands."
Nehemiah,13,27,Now I hear that you too are doing all of the same terrible and evil things. You aren’t being faithful to our God. You are marrying women from other lands.”
Nehemiah,13,28,"One of the sons of Joiada was the son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite. Joiada, the son of Eliashib, was the high priest. I drove Joiada’s son away from me."
Nehemiah,13,29,You are my God. Remember what those priests have done. They have brought shame to their own work. They have also brought shame to the covenant that God made with the priests and Levites long ago.
Nehemiah,13,30,So I made the priests and Levites pure. I made them pure from every practice that had come from other countries and had made them impure. I gave them their duties. Each one had his own job to do.
Nehemiah,13,31,I also made plans for gifts of wood to be brought at certain appointed times. And I made plans for the first share of the crops to be brought. You are my God. Please remember me with kindness.
