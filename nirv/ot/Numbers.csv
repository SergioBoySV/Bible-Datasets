Numbers,1,48,"The Lord had spoken to Moses. He had said,"
Numbers,1,49,“You must not count the men from the tribe of Levi. Do not include them when you list the other men of Israel.
Numbers,1,50,"Instead, put the Levites in charge of the holy tent. That is where the tablets of the covenant law are kept. The Levites will be in charge of everything that belongs to the holy tent. They must carry the tent and everything that belongs to it. They must take care of it. They must set up camp around it."
Numbers,1,51,"When the holy tent must be moved, the Levites must take it down. And when the tent must be set up, the Levites must do it. Anyone else who approaches it must be put to death."
Numbers,1,52,The Israelites must set up their tents by military groups. All of them must be in their own camps under their own flags.
Numbers,1,53,But the Levites must set up their tents around the holy tent. That’s where the tablets of the covenant law are kept. Then I will not be angry with the community of Israel. The Levites will be responsible for taking care of the tent.”
Numbers,1,54,The Israelites did everything just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
Numbers,2,1,"The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron. He said,"
Numbers,2,2,“The Israelites must camp around the tent of meeting. But they must not camp too close to it. All of them must camp under their flags and under the banners of their families.”
Numbers,2,3,"The groups of the camp of Judah must be on the east side. They must set up camp toward the sunrise. They must camp under their flag. The leader of the tribe of Judah is Nahshon, the son of Amminadab."

Numbers,2,10,"The groups of the camp of Reuben will be on the south side. They will be under their flag. The leader of the tribe of Reuben is Elizur, the son of Shedeur."

Numbers,2,15,"There are 45,650 men in Eliasaph’s group."
Numbers,2,16,"So a total of 151,450 men will be set apart for the camp of Reuben. They will be arranged group by group. They will start out second."
Numbers,2,17,Then the camp of the Levites will start out. The tent of meeting will go with them. They will march in the middle of the other camps. They will start out in the same order as they do when they set up camp. Each one will be in their own place under their flag.
Numbers,2,18,"The groups of the camp of Ephraim will be on the west side. They will be under their flag. The leader of the tribe of Ephraim is Elishama, the son of Ammihud."
Numbers,2,19,"There are 40,500 men in Elishama’s group."

Numbers,2,32,"Those are the men of Israel. They were counted according to their families. The total number of all the men in the camps is 603,550, group by group."
Numbers,2,33,But the Levites weren’t counted along with the other men of Israel. That’s what the Lord had commanded Moses.
Numbers,2,34,So the Israelites did everything the Lord had commanded Moses. That’s the way they set up camp under their flags. And that’s the way they started out. Each of them marched out with their own tribe and family.
Numbers,3,1,Here is the story of the family line of Aaron and Moses. It belongs to the time when the Lord spoke to Moses at Mount Sinai.
Numbers,3,2,"Aaron’s oldest son was Nadab. Aaron’s other sons were Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar."
Numbers,3,3,Those were the names of Aaron’s sons. They were the anointed priests. They were given authority to serve the Lord as priests.
Numbers,3,4,But Nadab and Abihu made an offering to the Lord by using fire that wasn’t allowed. So they died in front of him. That happened in the Desert of Sinai. They didn’t have any sons. Only Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests while their father Aaron was living.
Numbers,3,5,"The Lord spoke to Moses. He said,"
Numbers,3,6,“Bring the men of the tribe of Levi to Aaron the priest. They will help him.
Numbers,3,7,They must work at the tent of meeting for Aaron and for the whole community. They must do what needs to be done at the holy tent.
Numbers,3,8,"They must take care of everything connected with the tent of meeting. When they do, they are acting for all the Israelites."
Numbers,3,9,Give the Levites to Aaron and his sons. They are the men of Israel who must be given completely to him.
Numbers,3,10,Appoint Aaron and his sons to serve as priests. Anyone else who approaches the sacred tent must be put to death.”
Numbers,3,11,"The Lord also said to Moses,"
Numbers,3,12,“I have taken the Levites from among the Israelites. I have taken them in place of the son born first to each woman in Israel. The Levites belong to me.
Numbers,3,13,That’s because every male born first to a mother is mine. In Egypt I struck down all the males born first. I did it when I set apart for myself every male born first to a mother in Israel. That is true for men and animals alike. They belong to me. I am the Lord .”
Numbers,3,14,"The Lord spoke to Moses in the Desert of Sinai. He said,"
Numbers,3,15,“Count the Levites by their family groups. Count every male a month old or more.”
Numbers,3,16,So Moses counted them. He did just as the word of the Lord had commanded him.
Numbers,3,17,"The sons of Levi were Gershon, Kohath and Merari."
Numbers,3,18,The major families from Gershon were Libni and Shimei.

Numbers,3,20,The major families from Merari were Mahli and Mushi. These were the major families of the Levites.
Numbers,3,21,The families of Libni and Shimei belonged to the family of Gershon.
Numbers,3,22,"All the males a month old or more were counted. There were 7,500 of them."
Numbers,3,23,The families of Gershon had to camp on the west side. They had to camp behind the holy tent.
Numbers,3,24,"The leader of the families of Gershon was Eliasaph, the son of Lael."
Numbers,3,25,Here are the duties of the families of Gershon at the tent of meeting. They were responsible for taking care of the holy tent and its coverings. They took care of the curtain at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
Numbers,3,26,"They took care of the curtains of the courtyard. And they took care of the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard. The courtyard was all around the holy tent and altar. The families of Gershon also took care of the ropes. In fact, they had to take care of everything connected with the use of all those things."
Numbers,3,27,"The families of Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel belonged to the family of Kohath."
Numbers,3,28,"All the males a month old or more were counted. There were 8,600 of them. The families of Kohath were responsible for taking care of the sacred tent."
Numbers,3,29,They had to camp on the south side of the holy tent.

Numbers,3,31,"They were responsible for taking care of the ark of the covenant law. They took care of the table for the holy bread. They took care of the lampstand and the two altars. They took care of the things used for serving in the sacred tent. They also took care of the inner curtain. In fact, they had to take care of everything connected with the use of all those things."
Numbers,3,32,The chief leader of the Levites was Eleazar. He was the son of Aaron the priest. Eleazar was appointed over those responsible for taking care of the sacred tent.
Numbers,3,33,The families of Mahli and Mushi belonged to the family of Merari.
Numbers,3,34,"All the males a month old or more were counted. There were 6,200 of them."
Numbers,3,35,"The leader of the families of Merari was Zuriel, the son of Abihail. The families of Merari had to camp on the north side of the holy tent."
Numbers,3,36,"They were responsible for taking care of the frames of the tent. They took care of its crossbars, posts and bases. They took care of all its supplies. In fact, they had to take care of everything connected with the use of all those things."
Numbers,3,37,"They also took care of the posts of the courtyard around the holy tent. And they took care of the bases, tent stakes and ropes."
Numbers,3,38,"Moses, Aaron and Aaron’s sons had to camp to the east of the holy tent. They had to camp toward the sunrise in front of the tent of meeting. They were responsible for taking care of the sacred tent. They had to do it for the Israelites. Anyone else who approached the tent would be put to death."
Numbers,3,39,"The total number of the Levite males was 22,000. They were counted family by family. Every male a month old or more was counted. Moses and Aaron counted them, just as the Lord had commanded."
Numbers,3,40,"The Lord said to Moses, “Count all the Israelite males born first in their families. Count all those a month old or more. Make a list of their names."
Numbers,3,41,Take the Levites for me in their place. And take the livestock of the Levites in place of all the male animals in Israel born first to their mothers. I am the Lord .”
Numbers,3,42,So Moses counted all the oldest sons in Israel. He did just as the Lord had commanded him.
Numbers,3,43,"There were 22,273 of those sons a month old or more. They were listed by name."
Numbers,3,44,"The Lord also said to Moses,"
Numbers,3,45,“Take the Levites in place of all the males born first in Israel. Also take the livestock of the Levites in place of the livestock of Israel. The Levites belong to me. I am the Lord.
Numbers,3,46,But there are 273 more males born first in Israel than there are male Levites.
Numbers,3,47,Collect two ounces of silver for each of them. Weigh it out according to the standard weights used in the sacred tent.
Numbers,3,48,Give the silver to Aaron and his sons. It will buy the freedom of the additional sons in Israel.”
Numbers,3,49,So Moses collected the silver from the additional sons in Israel to buy their freedom. The Levites took the place of all the others.
Numbers,3,50,Moses collected 35 pounds of silver. It was weighed out according to the weights used in the sacred tent. Moses collected it from the oldest sons in Israel.
Numbers,3,51,He gave the silver to Aaron and his sons. He did just as the Lord had commanded him.

Numbers,4,2,“Count the Levites who belong to the families of Kohath. Make a list of them family by family.
Numbers,4,3,Count all the men 30 to 50 years old. Those are the men who must come and serve at the tent of meeting.

Numbers,4,5,"When the camp is ready to move, Aaron and his sons must go into the tent. They must take down the curtain that hides the ark where the tablets of the covenant law are kept. They must cover the ark with the curtain."
Numbers,4,6,Then they must cover that with strong leather. They must spread a solid blue cloth over the leather. And they must put the poles in place.
Numbers,4,7,"“They must spread a blue cloth over the table for the holy bread. They must put the plates, dishes and bowls on the cloth. They must also put the jars for drink offerings on it. The bread that is always kept there must remain on it."

They also include the meat forks, shovels and sprinkling bowls. Aaron and his sons must cover the altar with the strong leather. And they must put its poles in place."
Numbers,4,15,"“Aaron and his sons must cover all the holy things that belong to the holy tent. Only then are the men of Kohath to come and carry everything. They must do so only when the camp is ready to move. But they must not touch the holy things. If they do, they will die. The men of Kohath must carry everything in the tent of meeting."
Numbers,4,16,“Eleazar the priest will be in charge of the olive oil for the light. He is the son of Aaron. Eleazar will be in charge of the sweet-smelling incense. He will be in charge of the regular grain offering and the anointing oil. He will be in charge of the entire holy tent. He will also be in charge of everything in it. That includes all the things that belong to the tent.”
Numbers,4,17,"The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron. He said,"
Numbers,4,18,“Make sure that the Kohath families are not destroyed from among the Levites.
Numbers,4,19,I want them to live and not die when they come near the very holy things. So here is what you must do for them. Aaron and his sons must go into the sacred tent and tell each man what to do. They must tell each man what to carry.
Numbers,4,20,"But the men of Kohath must not go in and look at the holy things. They must not look at them even for a moment. If they do, they will die.”"
Numbers,4,21,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Numbers,4,22,“Count the families of Gershon. Make a list of them family by family.
Numbers,4,23,Count all the men 30 to 50 years old. Those are the men who must come and serve at the tent of meeting.

They must also carry all the supplies used for any purpose in the tent. The families of Gershon must do everything that needs to be done with those things.
Numbers,4,27,All their work must be done under the direction of Aaron and his sons. That includes carrying and everything else they do. Aaron and his sons must tell them what to carry. And that will be their work.
Numbers,4,28,It is what the families of Gershon must do at the tent of meeting. They must work under the direction of Ithamar the priest. He is the son of Aaron.
Numbers,4,29,“Count the families of Merari. Count them family by family.

Numbers,4,34,"Moses, Aaron and the leaders of the community counted the men of Kohath. They counted them family by family."

Numbers,4,36,"There were 2,750 men. They were counted family by family."
Numbers,4,37,That was the total of all the men in the families of Kohath who served at the tent of meeting. Moses and Aaron counted them. They did just as the Lord had commanded through Moses.

Numbers,4,47,All the men from 30 to 50 years old were counted. They were the men who came and served at the tent of meeting. They were also supposed to carry it.
Numbers,4,48,"The total number of men was 8,580."
Numbers,4,49,"Everything was done as the Lord had commanded through Moses. Each man was given his work. And each one was told what to carry. So they were counted, just as the Lord had commanded Moses."
Numbers,5,1,"The Lord spoke to Moses. He said,"
Numbers,5,2,“Tell the Israelites that certain people must be sent away from the camp. Command them to send away anyone who has a skin disease. They must send away all those who have liquid waste coming from their bodies. And they must send away those who are ‘unclean’ because they have touched a dead body.
Numbers,5,3,That applies to men and women alike. Send them out of the camp. They must not make their camp ‘unclean.’ That is where I live among them.”
Numbers,5,4,So the Israelites did what the Lord commanded. They sent out of the camp those who were “unclean.” They did just as the Lord had directed Moses.
Numbers,5,5,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Numbers,5,6,"“Speak to the Israelites. Say to them, ‘Suppose a man or woman does something wrong to someone else. Then that person is not being faithful to the Lord . People like that are guilty."
Numbers,5,7,They must admit they have committed a sin. They must pay in full for what they did wrong. And they must add a fifth of the value to it. Then they must give all of it to the person they have sinned against.
Numbers,5,8,But suppose that person has died. And suppose that person does not have a close relative who can be paid for the sin that was committed. Then what is paid belongs to the Lord . It must be given to the priest. A ram must be given along with it. The ram must be sacrificed to the Lord to pay for the sin.
Numbers,5,9,All the sacred gifts the Israelites bring to a priest will belong to him.
Numbers,5,10,Sacred gifts belong to their owners. But what they give to the priest will belong to the priest.’ ”
Numbers,5,11,"Then the Lord spoke to Moses again. He said,"
Numbers,5,12,"“Speak to the Israelites. Say to them, ‘Suppose a man’s wife goes astray. And suppose she is not faithful to her husband."
Numbers,5,13,Suppose another man has sex with her. And suppose this is hidden from her husband. No one knows she is not “clean.” So there is no witness against her. And she has not been caught in the act.
Numbers,5,14,"Suppose her husband becomes jealous. He does not trust his wife, and she is really “unclean.” Or suppose he does not trust her even though she is “clean.”"
Numbers,5,15,Then he must take his wife to the priest. He must also bring an offering. It must be eight cups of barley flour. The offering is for his wife. He must not pour olive oil on it. And he must not put incense on it. It is a grain offering for being jealous. It calls attention to the wrong thing a person has done.
Numbers,5,16,“ ‘The priest must have her stand in front of the Lord.
Numbers,5,17,He must pour some holy water into a clay jar. He must get some dust from the floor of the holy tent. And he must put it into the water.
Numbers,5,18,The priest must have the woman stand in front of the Lord . Then he must untie her hair. He must place in her hands the offering that calls attention to the wrong thing a person has done. It is the grain offering for being jealous. The priest must keep the bitter water with him. It is the water that brings a curse.
Numbers,5,19,"Then the priest must have the woman give her word. He must say to her, “Suppose no other man has had sex with you. And suppose you haven’t gone astray. You have kept yourself pure while you are married to your husband. Then may the bitter water that brings a curse not harm you."
Numbers,5,20,But suppose you have gone astray while you are married to your husband. You have made yourself ‘unclean.’ You have had sex with a man who isn’t your husband.”
Numbers,5,21,"At that point the priest must put the woman under the curse that will come if she breaks her word. He must say, “May the Lord cause you to become a curse among your people. You will become a curse when the Lord makes your body unable to have children."
Numbers,5,22,"May this water that brings a curse enter your body. May it make your body unable to have children.” “ ‘Then the woman must say, “Amen. Let it happen.”"
Numbers,5,23,“ ‘The priest must write the curses on a scroll. He must wash them off in the bitter water.
Numbers,5,24,It is the water he will make the woman drink. It is bitter water that brings a curse. It will enter her body. And it will cause her to suffer bitterly.
Numbers,5,25,The priest must take from her hands the grain offering for being jealous. He must lift it up and wave it in front of the Lord . He must bring it to the altar.
Numbers,5,26,"Then the priest must take a handful of the grain offering. It is the offering that calls attention to the wrong thing a person has done. The priest must burn it on the altar. After that, he must have the woman drink the water."
Numbers,5,27,Suppose she has made herself “unclean.” She has not been faithful to her husband. And she has drunk the water that brings a curse. Then it will go into her body. It will cause her to suffer bitterly. It will make her body unable to have children. She will become a curse.
Numbers,5,28,Suppose the woman has not made herself “unclean.” But suppose she is “clean.” Then she will be free of guilt. And she will be able to have children.
Numbers,5,29,“ ‘This is the law about being jealous. It applies to a woman who has gone astray. She has made herself “unclean” while she is married to her husband.
Numbers,5,30,And it applies to a man who becomes jealous. He has doubts about his wife. The priest must have her stand in front of the Lord . He must apply the entire law to her.
Numbers,5,31,The husband will not be guilty of doing anything wrong. But the woman will be punished for her sin.’ ”
Numbers,6,1,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Numbers,6,2,"“Say to the Israelites, ‘Suppose a man or woman wants to make a special promise. They want to set themselves apart to the Lord for a certain period of time. They want to be Nazirites."
Numbers,6,3,Then they must not drink any kind of wine. They must not drink vinegar made out of wine of any kind. They must not drink grape juice. They must not eat grapes or raisins.
Numbers,6,4,"As long as they are Nazirites, they must not eat anything grapevines produce. They must not even eat the seeds or skins of grapes."
Numbers,6,5,“ ‘They must not use razors on their heads. They must not cut their hair during the whole time they have set themselves apart to the Lord . They must be holy until that time is over. They must let the hair on their heads grow long.
Numbers,6,6,“ ‘And they must not go near a dead body during that whole time.
Numbers,6,7,But what if their father or mother dies? Or what if their brother or sister dies? Then they must not make themselves “unclean” because of them. The hair on their heads shows they are set apart for God.
Numbers,6,8,During the whole time they are set apart they are holy to the Lord.
Numbers,6,9,“ ‘Suppose someone dies suddenly in front of them. That makes the hair they have set apart to the Lord “unclean.” So they must shave their heads on the day they will be made “clean.” That is the seventh day.
Numbers,6,10,Then on the eighth day they must bring two doves. Or they can bring two young pigeons. They must bring them to the priest. He will be at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
Numbers,6,11,The priest must offer one of the birds as a sin offering. And he must offer the other as a burnt offering. The sacrifices will pay for the sin of the Nazirite man or woman. They sinned by being near a dead body. That same day they must make their heads holy again.
Numbers,6,12,They must set themselves apart to the Lord again. They must do it for the same period of time they had agreed to at first. And they must bring a male lamb a year old as a guilt offering. The days before that do not count. That is because they became “unclean” during the time they were set apart.
Numbers,6,13,“ ‘The time when the Nazirites are set apart will come to an end. Here is the law that applies to them at that time. They must be brought to the entrance to the tent of meeting.
Numbers,6,14,There they must present their offerings to the Lord . They must bring a male lamb a year old. It must not have any flaws. It is for a burnt offering. Then they must bring a female lamb a year old. It must not have any flaws. It is for a sin offering. And they must bring a ram that does not have any flaws. It is for a friendship offering.
Numbers,6,15,They must sacrifice the offerings together with their grain offerings and drink offerings. And they must also bring a basket of bread made with the finest flour. The bread must be made without yeast. The offering must include thick loaves with olive oil mixed in. And it must also include thin loaves brushed with olive oil.
Numbers,6,16,“ ‘The priest must bring all these things to the Lord . He must sacrifice the sin offering and the burnt offering.
Numbers,6,17,He must bring the basket of bread made without yeast. And he must sacrifice the ram. It will be a friendship offering to the Lord . The priest must bring it together with its grain offering and drink offering.
Numbers,6,18,“ ‘Then the Nazirites must shave off the hair that shows they have set themselves apart to the Lord . They must do it at the entrance to the tent of meeting. And they must put the hair in the fire that burns the sacrifice of the friendship offering.
Numbers,6,19,"“ ‘After the Nazirites have shaved off their hair, the priest must take a boiled shoulder of the ram. He must remove one thick loaf and one thin loaf from the basket. They must be made without yeast. And he must place the shoulder and the bread in the hands of the Nazirites."
Numbers,6,20,"Then he must lift up the shoulder and bread and wave them in front of the Lord . They are a wave offering. They are holy and belong to the priest. Other parts of the ram belong to the priest as well. They are the breast that was waved and the thigh that was offered. After the offering is waved, the Nazirites may drink wine."
Numbers,6,21,“ ‘This is the law of the Nazirites. They promise to sacrifice offerings to the Lord . They do it when they set themselves apart. And they should bring anything else they can afford. They must fulfill the promises they have made. They must do so according to the law of the Nazirites.’ ”
Numbers,6,22,"The Lord spoke to Moses. He said,"
Numbers,6,23,"“Tell Aaron and his sons, ‘Here is how I want you to bless the Israelites. Say to them,"
Numbers,6,24,“ ‘ “May the Lord bless you and take good care of you.
Numbers,6,25,May the Lord smile on you and be gracious to you.
Numbers,6,26,May the Lord look on you with favor and give you peace.” ’
Numbers,6,27,“In that way they will put the blessing of my name on the Israelites. And I will bless them.”
Numbers,7,1,Moses finished setting up the holy tent. Then he anointed it with olive oil. He set it apart to the Lord . He did the same thing with everything that belonged to it. He also anointed the altar. And he set apart to the Lord the altar and all its tools.
Numbers,7,2,Then the leaders of Israel brought their offerings. The leaders were the heads of the families. They were the leaders of the tribes. They were in charge of the men who had been counted.
Numbers,7,3,They brought gifts to the Lord . They brought six covered carts and 12 oxen. Each leader gave an ox. And every two leaders gave a cart. They put their gifts in front of the holy tent.
Numbers,7,4,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Numbers,7,5,“Accept the gifts from the leaders. I want their gifts to be used in the work at the tent of meeting. Give them to the Levites. They need them to do their work.”
Numbers,7,6,So Moses gave the carts and the oxen to the Levites.
Numbers,7,7,He gave two carts and four oxen to the men from the family of Gershon. They needed them to do their work.
Numbers,7,8,He gave four carts and eight oxen to the men from the family of Merari. They needed them to do their work. All these men were under the direction of Ithamar the priest. He was the son of Aaron.
Numbers,7,9,But Moses didn’t give any carts or oxen to the men from the family of Kohath. They had to carry the holy things on their shoulders. They were responsible for the holy things.
Numbers,7,10,"When the altar was anointed, the leaders brought their offerings. They placed them in front of the altar. They brought their offerings in order to set apart the altar."

Numbers,7,89,Moses entered the tent of meeting. He wanted to speak with the Lord . There Moses heard the Lord talking to him. The Lord ’s voice was speaking to him from between the two cherubim. The cherubim were over the place where sin is paid for. It was the cover on the ark where the tablets of the covenant law were kept. In this way the Lord spoke to Moses.
Numbers,8,1,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Numbers,8,2,"“Say to Aaron, ‘Set up the seven lamps. They will light up the area in front of the lampstand.’ ”"
Numbers,8,3,So Aaron did it. He set up the lamps so that they faced forward on the lampstand. He did just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
Numbers,8,4,The lampstand was made out of hammered gold. From its base to its blooms it was made out of hammered gold. The lampstand was made exactly like the pattern the Lord had shown Moses.
Numbers,8,5,"The Lord spoke to Moses. He said,"
Numbers,8,6,“Take the Levites from among all the Israelites. Make them ‘clean’ in the usual way.
Numbers,8,7,Here is how to make them pure. Sprinkle the special water on them. Then have them shave their whole bodies. Also have them wash their clothes. That is how they will make themselves pure.
Numbers,8,8,Have them get a young bull along with its grain offering. The offering must be made out of the finest flour mixed with olive oil. Then you must get a second young bull. You must sacrifice it as a sin offering.
Numbers,8,9,Bring the Levites to the front of the tent of meeting. Gather the whole community of Israel together.
Numbers,8,10,You must bring the Levites to me. The Israelites must place their hands on them.
Numbers,8,11,Aaron must bring the Levites to me. They are a wave offering from the Israelites. That is how they will be set apart to do my work.
Numbers,8,12,“Then I want the Levites to place their hands on the heads of the bulls. They must sacrifice one bull as a sin offering to me. And they must sacrifice the other as a burnt offering. The blood of the bulls will pay for the sin of the Levites.
Numbers,8,13,Have the Levites stand in front of Aaron and his sons. Then give them as a wave offering to me.
Numbers,8,14,That is how I want you to set apart the Levites from the other Israelites. The Levites will belong to me.
Numbers,8,15,“Make the Levites pure. Give them to me as a wave offering. Then they must come to do their work at the tent of meeting.
Numbers,8,16,They are the Israelites who will be given to me completely. I have taken them to be my own. I have taken them in place of every son born first in his family in Israel.
Numbers,8,17,Every male born first in Israel belongs to me. That is true whether it is a human or an animal. In Egypt I struck down all the males born first to their mothers. Then I set apart for myself all the males born first in Israel.
Numbers,8,18,And I have taken the Levites in place of all the sons born first in Israel.
Numbers,8,19,I have given the Levites as gifts to Aaron and his sons. I have taken them from among all the Israelites. I have appointed them to do the work at the tent of meeting. They will do it in place of the Israelites. That is how they will keep the Israelites from being guilty when they go near the sacred tent. Then no plague will strike the Israelites when they go near the tent.”
Numbers,8,20,So Moses and Aaron and all the Israelites did with the Levites just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
Numbers,8,21,The Levites made themselves pure. They washed their clothes. Then Aaron gave them to the Lord as a wave offering. That’s how he paid for their sin to make them pure.
Numbers,8,22,"After that, the Levites came to do their work at the tent of meeting. They worked under the direction of Aaron and his sons. And so Moses and Aaron and the whole community of Israel did with the Levites just as the Lord had commanded Moses."
Numbers,8,23,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Numbers,8,24,“Here is what the Levites must do. Men 25 years old or more must come and take part in the work at the tent of meeting.
Numbers,8,25,"But when they reach the age of 50, they must not work any longer. They must stop doing their regular work."
Numbers,8,26,They can help their brothers with their duties at the tent of meeting. But they themselves should not do the work. That is how you must direct the Levites to do their work.”
Numbers,9,1,"The Lord spoke to Moses in the Desert of Sinai. It was the first month of the second year after the people came out of Egypt. He said,"
Numbers,9,2,“Tell the Israelites to celebrate the Passover Feast. Have them do it at the appointed time.
Numbers,9,3,Celebrate it when the sun goes down on the 14th day of this month. Obey all its rules and laws.”
Numbers,9,4,So Moses told the Israelites to celebrate the Passover Feast.
Numbers,9,5,They did it in the Desert of Sinai. They celebrated it when the sun went down on the 14th day of the first month. The Israelites did everything just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
Numbers,9,6,But some of them couldn’t celebrate the Passover Feast on that day. That’s because they weren’t “clean.” They had gone near a dead body. So they came to Moses and Aaron that same day.
Numbers,9,7,"They said to Moses, “We went near a dead body. So we aren’t ‘clean.’ But why should we be kept from bringing the Lord ’s offering at the appointed time? Why shouldn’t we bring it along with the other Israelites?”"
Numbers,9,8,"Moses answered them, “Wait until I find out what the Lord wants you to do.”"
Numbers,9,9,"Then the Lord spoke to Moses. He said,"
Numbers,9,10,"“Tell the Israelites, ‘Suppose any of you or your children are “unclean” because they have gone near a dead body. Or suppose they are away on a journey. They must still celebrate the Lord ’s Passover."
Numbers,9,11,They must celebrate it on the 14th day of the second month. They must do so when the sun goes down. They must eat the lamb together with bread made without yeast. They must eat it with bitter plants.
Numbers,9,12,"They must not leave any of it until morning. They must not break any of its bones. When they celebrate the Passover Feast, they must follow all the rules."
Numbers,9,13,But suppose someone is “clean” and not on a journey. And they fail to celebrate the Passover Feast. Then they must be separated from the community of Israel. They did not bring the Lord ’s offering at the appointed time. They will be punished for their sin.
Numbers,9,14,“ ‘What if there is an outsider living among you? And what if they want to celebrate the Lord ’s Passover? Then they must obey its rules and laws. You must have the same laws for outsiders as you do for the Israelites.’ ”
Numbers,9,15,"The holy tent was set up. It was the tent where the tablets of the covenant law were kept. On the day it was set up, the cloud covered it. From evening until morning the cloud above the tent looked like fire."
Numbers,9,16,That’s what continued to happen. The cloud covered the tent. At night the cloud looked like fire.
Numbers,9,17,"When the cloud lifted from its place above the tent, the Israelites started out. Where the cloud settled, the Israelites camped."
Numbers,9,18,"When the Lord gave the command, the Israelites started out. And when he gave the command, they camped. As long as the cloud stayed above the holy tent, they remained in camp."
Numbers,9,19,Sometimes the cloud remained above the tent for a long time. Then the Israelites obeyed the Lord ’s order. They didn’t start out.
Numbers,9,20,"Sometimes the cloud was above the tent for only a few days. When the Lord would give the command, they would camp. And when he would give the command, they would start out."
Numbers,9,21,"Sometimes the cloud stayed only from evening until morning. When it lifted in the morning, they started out. It didn’t matter whether it was day or night. When the cloud lifted, the people started out."
Numbers,9,22,"It didn’t matter whether the cloud stayed above the holy tent for two days or a month or a year. The Israelites would remain in camp. They wouldn’t start out. But when the cloud lifted, they would start out."
Numbers,9,23,"When the Lord gave the command, they camped. And when he gave the command, they started out. They obeyed the Lord ’s order. They obeyed him, just as he had commanded them through Moses."
Numbers,10,1,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Numbers,10,2,“Make two trumpets out of hammered silver. Blow them when you want the community to gather together. And blow them when you want the camps to start out.
Numbers,10,3,"When both trumpets are blown, the whole community must gather in front of you. They must come to the entrance to the tent of meeting."
Numbers,10,4,Suppose only one trumpet is blown. Then the leaders must gather in front of you. They are the heads of the tribes of Israel.
Numbers,10,5,"When a trumpet blast is blown, the tribes camped on the east side must start out."
Numbers,10,6,"When the second blast is blown, the camps on the south side must start out. The blast will tell them when to start."
Numbers,10,7,Blow the trumpets to gather the people together. But do not use the same kind of blast.
Numbers,10,8,"“The sons of Aaron, the priests, must blow the trumpets. That is a law for you and your children after you for all time to come."
Numbers,10,9,"Suppose you go into battle in your own land. And suppose it is against an enemy who is treating you badly. Then blow a blast on the trumpets. If you do, I will remember you. I will save you from your enemies. I am the Lord your God."
Numbers,10,10,You must also blow the trumpets when you are happy. Blow them at your appointed feasts. Blow them at your New Moon feasts. Blow them when you sacrifice your burnt offerings. Blow them when you sacrifice your friendship offerings. They will remind me of you. I am the Lord your God.”
Numbers,10,11,It was the 20th day of the second month of the second year. On that day the cloud began to move. It went up from above the holy tent where the tablets of the covenant law were kept.
Numbers,10,12,Then the Israelites started out from the Desert of Sinai. They traveled from place to place. They kept going until the cloud came to rest in the Desert of Paran.
Numbers,10,13,"The first time they started out, the Lord commanded Moses to tell them to do it. And they did it."
Numbers,10,14,The groups of the camp of Judah went first. They marched out under their flag. Nahshon was their commander. He was the son of Amminadab.
Numbers,10,15,Nethanel was over the group of the tribe of Issachar. Nethanel was the son of Zuar.
Numbers,10,16,Eliab was over the group of the tribe of Zebulun. Eliab was the son of Helon.
Numbers,10,17,The holy tent was taken down. The men of Gershon and Merari started out. They carried the tent.
Numbers,10,18,The groups of the camp of Reuben went next. They marched out under their flag. Elizur was their commander. He was the son of Shedeur.
Numbers,10,19,Shelumiel was over the group of the tribe of Simeon. Shelumiel was the son of Zurishaddai.
Numbers,10,20,Eliasaph was over the group of the tribe of Gad. Eliasaph was the son of Deuel.
Numbers,10,21,The men of Kohath started out. They carried the holy things. The holy tent had to be set up before they arrived.
Numbers,10,22,The groups of the camp of Ephraim went next. They marched out under their flag. Elishama was their commander. He was the son of Ammihud.
Numbers,10,23,Gamaliel was over the group of the tribe of Manasseh. Gamaliel was the son of Pedahzur.
Numbers,10,24,Abidan was over the group of the tribe of Benjamin. Abidan was the son of Gideoni.
Numbers,10,25,"Finally, the groups of the camp of Dan started out. They marched out under their flag. They followed behind all the other groups and guarded them. Ahiezer was their commander. He was the son of Ammishaddai."
Numbers,10,26,Pagiel was over the group of the tribe of Asher. Pagiel was the son of Okran.
Numbers,10,27,Ahira was over the group of the tribe of Naphtali. Ahira was the son of Enan.
Numbers,10,28,"As the groups of Israel started out, that was the order they marched in."
Numbers,10,29,"Moses spoke to Hobab, the son of Reuel. Reuel was Moses’ father-in-law. Reuel was from Midian. Moses said to Hobab, “We’re starting out for the place the Lord promised to us. He said to us, ‘I will give it to you.’ So come with us. We’ll treat you well. The Lord has promised to give good things to Israel.”"
Numbers,10,30,"Hobab answered, “No. I can’t go. I’m going back to my own land. I’m returning to my own people.”"
Numbers,10,31,"But Moses said, “Please don’t leave us. You know where we should camp in the desert. You can be our guide."
Numbers,10,32,So come with us. The Lord will give us good things. We’ll share them with you.”
Numbers,10,33,So they started out from the mountain of the Lord . They traveled for three days. The ark of the covenant of the Lord went in front of them during those three days. It went ahead of them to find a place for them to rest.
Numbers,10,34,They started out from the camp by day. And the cloud of the Lord was above them.
Numbers,10,35,"When the ark started out, Moses said, “ Lord , rise up! Let your enemies be scattered. Let them run away from you.”"
Numbers,10,36,"When the ark stopped, Moses said, “ Lord , return. Return to the many thousands of people in Israel.”"
Numbers,11,1,The people weren’t happy about the hard times they were having. The Lord heard what they were saying. It made him very angry. Then the Lord sent fire on them. It blazed out among the people. It burned up some of the outer edges of the camp.
Numbers,11,2,The people cried out to Moses. Then he prayed to the Lord . And the fire died down.
Numbers,11,3,So that place was named Taberah. That’s because fire from the Lord had blazed out among them there.
Numbers,11,4,"Some people with them began to wish for other food. Again the Israelites began to cry out. They said, “We wish we had meat to eat."
Numbers,11,5,"We remember the fish we ate in Egypt. It didn’t cost us anything. We also remember the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions and garlic."
Numbers,11,6,But now we’ve lost all interest in eating. We never see anything but this manna!”
Numbers,11,7,The manna was like coriander seeds. It looked like sap from a tree.
Numbers,11,8,The people went around gathering it. Then they ground it up in a small mill they held in their hands. Or they crushed it in a stone bowl. They cooked it in a pot. Or they made loaves out of it. It tasted like something made with olive oil.
Numbers,11,9,"When the dew came down on the camp at night, the manna also came down."
Numbers,11,10,Moses heard people from every family crying at the entrances to their tents. The Lord became very angry. So Moses became upset.
Numbers,11,11,"He asked the Lord , “Why have you brought this trouble on me? Why aren’t you pleased with me? Why have you loaded me down with the troubles of all these people?"
Numbers,11,12,Am I like a mother to them? Are they my children? Why do you tell me to carry them in my arms? Do I have to carry them the way a nurse carries a baby? Do I have to carry them to the land you promised? You promised the land to their people of long ago.
Numbers,11,13,"Where can I get meat for all these people? They keep crying out to me. They say, ‘Give us meat to eat!’"
Numbers,11,14,I can’t carry all these people by myself. The load is too heavy for me.
Numbers,11,15,"Is this how you are going to treat me? If you are pleased with me, just put me to death right now. Don’t let me live if I have to see myself destroyed anyway.”"
Numbers,11,16,"The Lord said to Moses, “Bring me 70 of Israel’s elders. Bring men that you know are leaders and officials among the people. Have them come to the tent of meeting. I want them to stand there with you."
Numbers,11,17,I will come down and speak with you there. I will take some of the power of the Spirit that is on you. And I will put it on them. They will share the responsibility of these people with you. Then you will not have to carry it alone.
Numbers,11,18,"“Tell the people, ‘Set yourselves apart for tomorrow. At that time you will eat meat. The Lord heard you when you cried out. You said, “We wish we had meat to eat. We were better off in Egypt.” Now the Lord will give you meat. And you will eat it."
Numbers,11,19,"You will not eat it for just one or two days. You will not eat it for just five, ten or 20 days."
Numbers,11,20,"Instead, you will eat it for a whole month. You will eat it until it comes out of your noses. You will eat it until you hate it. The Lord is among you. But you have turned your back on him. You have cried out while he was listening. You have said, “Why did we ever leave Egypt?” ’ ”"
Numbers,11,21,"But Moses said to the Lord , “Here I am among 600,000 men on the march. And you say, ‘I will give them meat to eat for a whole month’!"
Numbers,11,22,Would they have enough if flocks and herds were killed for them? Would they have enough even if all the fish in the ocean were caught for them?”
Numbers,11,23,"The Lord answered Moses, “Am I not strong enough? Now you will see whether what I say will come true for you.”"
Numbers,11,24,So Moses went out. He told the people what the Lord had said. He gathered 70 of their elders together. He had them stand around the tent of meeting.
Numbers,11,25,"Then the Lord came down in the cloud. He spoke with Moses. He took some of the power of the Spirit that was on Moses. And he put it on the 70 elders. When the Spirit came on them, they prophesied. But they didn’t do it again."
Numbers,11,26,"Two men had remained in the camp. Their names were Eldad and Medad. They were listed among the elders. But they didn’t go out to the tent of meeting. In spite of that, the Spirit came on them too. So they prophesied in the camp."
Numbers,11,27,"A young man ran up to Moses. He said, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.”"
Numbers,11,28,"Joshua spoke up. He was the son of Nun. Joshua had been Moses’ helper from the time he was young. He said, “Moses! Please stop them!”"
Numbers,11,29,"But Moses replied, “Are you jealous for me? I wish that all the Lord ’s people were prophets. And I wish that the Lord would put his Spirit on them.”"
Numbers,11,30,Then Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp.
Numbers,11,31,The Lord sent out a wind. It drove quail in from the Red Sea. It scattered them all around the camp. They were about three feet above the ground. They could be seen in every direction as far as a person could walk in a day.
Numbers,11,32,The people went out all day and gathered quail. They gathered them all night and all the next day. No one gathered less than 60 bushels. Then they spread the quail out all around the camp.
Numbers,11,33,"But while the meat was still in their mouths, the Lord acted. Before the people could swallow it, he became very angry with them. He struck them with a terrible plague."
Numbers,11,34,So the place was named Kibroth Hattaavah. That’s where the bodies of the people who had wished for other food were buried.
Numbers,11,35,From Kibroth Hattaavah the people traveled to Hazeroth. And they stayed there.
Numbers,12,1,Miriam and Aaron began to say bad things about Moses. That’s because Moses had married a woman from Cush.
Numbers,12,2,“Has the Lord spoken only through Moses?” they asked. “Hasn’t he also spoken through us?” The Lord heard what they said.
Numbers,12,3,"Moses was a very humble man. In fact, he was more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth."
Numbers,12,4,"The Lord spoke to Moses, Aaron and Miriam. He said, “All three of you, come out to the tent of meeting.” So they did."
Numbers,12,5,Then the Lord came down in a pillar of cloud. He stood at the entrance to the tent. And he told Aaron and Miriam to come to him. The two of them stepped forward.
Numbers,12,6,"Then the Lord said, “Listen to my words. “Suppose there is a prophet among you. I, the Lord , make myself known to them in visions. I speak to them in dreams."
Numbers,12,7,But this is not true of my servant Moses. He is faithful in everything he does in my house.
Numbers,12,8,With Moses I speak face to face. I speak with him clearly. I do not speak in riddles. I let him see something of what I look like. So why were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?”
Numbers,12,9,The Lord was very angry with them. And he left them.
Numbers,12,10,"When the cloud went up from above the tent, there stood Miriam. She had a disease that made her skin as white as snow. Aaron turned toward her. He saw that she had a skin disease."
Numbers,12,11,"So he said to Moses, “We have committed a very foolish sin. Please don’t hold it against us."
Numbers,12,12,Don’t let Miriam be like a baby that was born dead. Don’t let her look like a dead baby whose body is half eaten away.”
Numbers,12,13,"So Moses cried out to the Lord . He said, “Please, God, heal her!”"
Numbers,12,14,"The Lord answered Moses. He said, “Suppose her father had spit in her face. Then she would have been put to shame for seven days. So keep her outside the camp for seven days. After that, you can bring her back.”"
Numbers,12,15,So Miriam was kept outside the camp for seven days. The people didn’t move on until she was brought back.
Numbers,12,16,"After that, the people left Hazeroth. They camped in the Desert of Paran."
Numbers,13,1,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Numbers,13,2,“Send some men to check out the land of Canaan. I am giving it to the Israelites. Send one leader from each of Israel’s tribes.”
Numbers,13,3,So Moses sent them out from the Desert of Paran. He sent them as the Lord had commanded. All of them were leaders of the Israelites.
Numbers,13,4,Here are their names. There was Shammua from the tribe of Reuben. Shammua was the son of Zakkur.
Numbers,13,5,There was Shaphat from the tribe of Simeon. Shaphat was the son of Hori.
Numbers,13,6,There was Caleb from the tribe of Judah. Caleb was the son of Jephunneh.
Numbers,13,7,There was Igal from the tribe of Issachar. Igal was the son of Joseph.
Numbers,13,8,There was Hoshea from the tribe of Ephraim. Hoshea was the son of Nun.
Numbers,13,9,There was Palti from the tribe of Benjamin. Palti was the son of Raphu.
Numbers,13,10,There was Gaddiel from the tribe of Zebulun. Gaddiel was the son of Sodi.
Numbers,13,11,There was Gaddi from the tribe of Manasseh. Gaddi was the son of Susi. Manasseh was a tribe of Joseph.
Numbers,13,12,There was Ammiel from the tribe of Dan. Ammiel was the son of Gemalli.
Numbers,13,13,There was Sethur from the tribe of Asher. Sethur was the son of Michael.
Numbers,13,14,There was Nahbi from the tribe of Naphtali. Nahbi was the son of Vophsi.
Numbers,13,15,There was Geuel from the tribe of Gad. Geuel was the son of Maki.
Numbers,13,16,"Those are the men Moses sent to check out the land. He gave the name Joshua to Hoshea, the son of Nun."
Numbers,13,17,"Moses sent the 12 men to check out Canaan. He said, “Go up through the Negev Desert. Go on into the central hill country."
Numbers,13,18,See what the land is like. See whether the people who live there are strong or weak. See whether they are few or many.
Numbers,13,19,What kind of land do they live in? Is it good or bad? What kind of towns do they live in? Do the towns have high walls around them or not?
Numbers,13,20,How is the soil? Is it rich land or poor land? Are there trees in it or not? Do your best to bring back some of the fruit of the land.” It was the season for the first ripe grapes.
Numbers,13,21,So the men went up and checked out the land. They went from the Desert of Zin as far as Rehob. It was in the direction of Lebo Hamath.
Numbers,13,22,"They went up through the Negev Desert and came to Hebron. That’s where Ahiman, Sheshai and Talmai lived. They belonged to the family line of Anak. Hebron had been built seven years before Zoan. Zoan was a city in Egypt."
Numbers,13,23,The men came to the Valley of Eshkol. There they cut off a branch that had a single bunch of grapes on it. Two of them carried it on a pole between them. They carried some pomegranates and figs along with it.
Numbers,13,24,That place was called the Valley of Eshkol. That’s because the men of Israel cut off a bunch of grapes there.
Numbers,13,25,"At the end of 40 days, the men returned from checking out the land."
Numbers,13,26,"The men came back to Moses, Aaron and the whole community of Israel. The people were at Kadesh in the Desert of Paran. There the men reported to Moses and Aaron and all the people. They showed them the fruit of the land."
Numbers,13,27,"They gave Moses their report. They said, “We went into the land you sent us to. It really does have plenty of milk and honey! Here’s some fruit from the land."
Numbers,13,28,But the people who live there are powerful. Their cities have high walls around them and are very large. We even saw members of the family line of Anak there.
Numbers,13,29,"The Amalekites live in the Negev Desert. The Hittites, Jebusites and Amorites live in the central hill country. The Canaanites live near the Mediterranean Sea. They also live along the Jordan River.”"
Numbers,13,30,"Then Caleb interrupted the men speaking to Moses. He said, “We should go up and take the land. We can certainly do it.”"
Numbers,13,31,"But the men who had gone up with him spoke. They said, “We can’t attack those people. They are stronger than we are.”"
Numbers,13,32,"The men spread a bad report about the land among the Israelites. They said, “The land we checked out destroys those who live in it. All the people we saw there are very big and tall."
Numbers,13,33,We saw the Nephilim there. We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes. And that’s also how we seemed to them.” The family line of Anak came from the Nephilim.
Numbers,14,1,That night all the members of the community raised their voices. They wept out loud.
Numbers,14,2,"The Israelites spoke against Moses and Aaron. The whole community said to them, “We wish we had died in Egypt or even in this desert."
Numbers,14,3,Why is the Lord bringing us to this land? We’re going to be killed by swords. Our enemies will capture our wives and children. Wouldn’t it be better for us to go back to Egypt?”
Numbers,14,4,"They said to one another, “We should choose another leader. We should go back to Egypt.”"
Numbers,14,5,Then Moses and Aaron fell with their faces to the ground. They did it in front of the whole community of Israel gathered there.
Numbers,14,6,"Joshua, the son of Nun, tore his clothes. So did Caleb, the son of Jephunneh. Joshua and Caleb were two of the men who had checked out the land."
Numbers,14,7,"They spoke to the whole community of Israel. They said, “We passed through the land and checked it out. It’s very good."
Numbers,14,8,"If the Lord is pleased with us, he’ll lead us into that land. It’s a land that has plenty of milk and honey. He’ll give it to us."
Numbers,14,9,But don’t refuse to obey him. And don’t be afraid of the people of the land. We will swallow them up. The Lord is with us. So nothing can save them. Don’t be afraid of them.”
Numbers,14,10,But all the people talked about killing Joshua and Caleb by throwing stones at them. Then the glory of the Lord appeared at the tent of meeting. All the Israelites saw it.
Numbers,14,11,"The Lord said to Moses, “How long will these people not respect me? How long will they refuse to believe in me? They refuse even though I have done many signs among them."
Numbers,14,12,So I will strike them down with a plague. I will destroy them. But I will make you into a greater and stronger nation than they are.”
Numbers,14,13,"Moses said to the Lord , “Then the Egyptians will hear about it. You used your power to bring these people up from among them."
Numbers,14,14,"And the Egyptians will tell the people who live in Canaan about it. Lord , they have already heard a lot about you. They’ve heard that you are with these people. They’ve heard that you have been seen face to face. They’ve been told that your cloud stays over them. They’ve heard that you go in front of them in a pillar of cloud by day. They’ve been told that you go in front of them in a pillar of fire at night."
Numbers,14,15,"Suppose you put all these people to death and leave none alive. Then the nations who have heard these things about you will talk. They’ll say,"
Numbers,14,16,‘The Lord promised to give these people the land of Canaan. But he wasn’t able to bring them into it. So he killed them in the desert.’
Numbers,14,17,"“Now, Lord, show your strength. You have said,"
Numbers,14,18,"‘I am the Lord . I am slow to get angry. I am full of love. I forgive those who sin. I forgive those who refuse to obey. But I do not let guilty people go without punishing them. I cause the sin of the parents to affect their children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.’"
Numbers,14,19,"Lord , your love is great. So forgive the sin of these people. Forgive them just as you have done from the time they left Egypt until now.”"
Numbers,14,20,"The Lord replied, “I have forgiven them, just as you asked."
Numbers,14,21,You can be sure that I live. You can be just as sure that my glory fills the whole earth.
Numbers,14,22,And here is what you can be just as sure of. Not one of these people will see the land I promised to give them. They have seen my glory. They have seen the signs I did in Egypt. And they have seen what I did in the desert. But they did not obey me. And they have tested me ten times.
Numbers,14,23,So not even one of them will ever see the land I promised to give to their people of long ago. The person who has not respected me will never see it.
Numbers,14,24,But my servant Caleb has a different spirit. He follows me with his whole heart. So I will bring him into the land he went to. And his children after him will receive land there.
Numbers,14,25,The Amalekites and the Canaanites are living in the valleys. So turn back tomorrow. Start out toward the desert. Go along the way that leads to the Red Sea.”
Numbers,14,26,"The Lord said to Moses and Aaron,"
Numbers,14,27,“How long will this evil community speak against me? I have heard these Israelites talk about how unhappy they are.
Numbers,14,28,"So tell them, ‘Here is what I am announcing. I am the Lord . You can be sure that I live. And here is what you can be just as sure of. I will do to you the very thing that I heard you say."
Numbers,14,29,You will die in this desert. Every one of you 20 years old or more will die. Every one of you who was counted in the list of the people will die. Every one of you who has spoken out against me will be wiped out.
Numbers,14,30,"I lifted up my hand and promised to make this land your home. But now not all of you will enter the land. Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, will enter it. So will Joshua, the son of Nun. They are the only ones who will enter the land."
Numbers,14,31,You have said that your enemies would capture your children. But I will bring your children in to enjoy the land you have turned your backs on.
Numbers,14,32,"As for you, you will die in the desert."
Numbers,14,33,Your children will be shepherds here for 40 years. They will suffer because you were not faithful. They will suffer until the last of your bodies lies here in the desert.
Numbers,14,34,For 40 years you will suffer for your sins. That is one year for each of the 40 days you checked out the land. You will know what it is like to have me against you.’
Numbers,14,35,"I, the Lord , have spoken. I will surely do these things to this entire evil community of Israel. They have joined together against me. They will meet their end in this desert. They will die here.”"
Numbers,14,36,So the Lord struck down the men Moses had sent to check out the land. They had returned and had spread a bad report about the land. And that had made the whole community speak out against Moses.
Numbers,14,37,Those men were to blame for spreading the bad report. So the Lord struck them down. They died of a plague.
Numbers,14,38,"Only two of the men who went to check out the land remained alive. One of them was Joshua, the son of Nun. The other was Caleb, the son of Jephunneh."
Numbers,14,39,Moses reported to all the Israelites what the Lord had said. And they became very sad.
Numbers,14,40,"Early the next morning they set out for the highest point in the hill country. “We have sinned,” they said. “Now we are ready to go up to the land the Lord promised to give us.”"
Numbers,14,41,"But Moses said, “Why aren’t you obeying the Lord ’s command? You won’t succeed."
Numbers,14,42,So don’t go up. The Lord isn’t with you. Your enemies will win the battle over you.
Numbers,14,43,The Amalekites and the Canaanites will meet you on the field of battle. You have turned away from the Lord . So he won’t be with you. And you will be killed by swords.”
Numbers,14,44,But they wouldn’t listen. They still went up toward the highest point in the hill country. They went up even though Moses didn’t move from the camp. They went even though the ark of the Lord ’s covenant didn’t move from the camp.
Numbers,14,45,Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites who lived in that hill country came down. They attacked the Israelites. They won the battle over them. They chased the Israelites all the way to Hormah.
Numbers,15,1,Here is what the Lord said to Moses.
Numbers,15,2,"“Say to the Israelites, ‘You are going to enter the land I am giving you as a home."
Numbers,15,3,"When you do, you will present food offerings to the Lord . The animals must come from your herd or flock. The smell of the offerings will please the Lord . They can be either burnt offerings or sacrifices. They can be either for special promises or for feast offerings. Or they can be for offerings you choose to give."
Numbers,15,4,"With each of the offerings, the person who brings it must present to the Lord a grain offering. It must be eight cups of the finest flour. It must be mixed with a quart of olive oil."
Numbers,15,5,Also prepare a quart of wine as a drink offering. You must present it with each lamb that you bring for the burnt offering or the sacrifice.
Numbers,15,6,“ ‘Prepare a grain offering to present along with a ram. The grain offering must be 16 cups of the finest flour. It must be mixed with two and a half pints of olive oil.
Numbers,15,7,You must bring two and a half pints of wine as a drink offering. Offer everything as a smell that pleases the Lord.
Numbers,15,8,“ ‘Suppose you prepare a young bull as a burnt offering or sacrifice. You prepare it to keep a special promise to the Lord . Or you prepare it to present as a friendship offering.
Numbers,15,9,Then bring a grain offering with the bull. The grain offering must be 24 cups of the finest flour. It must be mixed with two quarts of olive oil.
Numbers,15,10,Also bring two quarts of wine as a drink offering. It will be a food offering. Its smell will please the Lord.
Numbers,15,11,Each bull or ram must be prepared in the same way. Each lamb or young goat must also be prepared in that way.
Numbers,15,12,Do it for each animal. Do it for as many animals as you prepare.
Numbers,15,13,“ ‘Everyone in Israel must do those things in that way. He must do them when he presents a food offering. The smell of offerings like that pleases the Lord.
Numbers,15,14,Everyone must always do what the law requires. It does not matter whether they are an outsider or anyone else living among you. They must do exactly as you do when they present a food offering. The smell of offerings like that pleases the Lord.
Numbers,15,15,"The community must have the same rules for you and for any outsider living among you. This law will last for all time to come. In the sight of the Lord , the law applies both to you and any outsider."
Numbers,15,16,The same laws and rules will apply to you and to any outsider living among you.’ ”
Numbers,15,17,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Numbers,15,18,"“Speak to the Israelites. Say to them, ‘You are going to enter the land I am taking you to."
Numbers,15,19,"You will eat its food. When you do, present part of it as an offering to the Lord."
Numbers,15,20,Present a loaf made from the first flour you grind. Present it as an offering from the threshing floor.
Numbers,15,21,You must present the offering to the Lord . You must present it from the first grain you grind. You must do it for all time to come.
Numbers,15,22,“ ‘Suppose you as a community fail to keep any of the commands the Lord gave Moses. And suppose you do it without meaning to.
Numbers,15,23,That applies to any of the commands the Lord told Moses to give you. And they are in effect from the day the Lord gave them and for all time to come.
Numbers,15,24,"Suppose the community sins without meaning to. And suppose they do not know they have sinned. Then the whole community must offer a young bull. They must sacrifice it for a burnt offering. Its smell will please the Lord . Along with it, they must offer its required grain offering and drink offering. They must also sacrifice a male goat for a sin offering."
Numbers,15,25,With it the priest will pay for the sin of the whole community of Israel. Then they will be forgiven. They did not mean to commit that sin. And they have presented to the Lord a food offering for the wrong thing they did. They have brought a sin offering with it.
Numbers,15,26,"The Lord will forgive the whole community of Israel and the outsiders living among them. All the people had a part in the sin, even though they did not mean to do it."
Numbers,15,27,“ ‘But suppose just one person sins without meaning to. Then that person must bring a female goat for a sin offering. It must be a year old.
Numbers,15,28,"With it the priest will pay for the person’s sin in front of the Lord . The priest will do it for the one who did wrong by sinning without meaning to. When the sin is paid for, that person will be forgiven."
Numbers,15,29,The same law applies to everyone who sins without meaning to. It does not matter whether they are an Israelite or an outsider.
Numbers,15,30,“ ‘But suppose someone sins on purpose. It does not matter whether they are an Israelite or an outsider. They speak evil things against the Lord . They must be separated from the community of Israel.
Numbers,15,31,They have not respected what the Lord has said. They have broken the Lord ’s commands. They must certainly be separated from the community. They are still guilty.’ ”
Numbers,15,32,"The Israelites were in the desert. One Sabbath day, people saw a man gathering wood."
Numbers,15,33,They brought him to Moses and Aaron and the whole community.
Numbers,15,34,They kept him under guard. It wasn’t clear what should be done to him.
Numbers,15,35,"Then the Lord said to Moses, “The man must die. The whole community must kill him by throwing stones at him. They must do it outside the camp.”"
Numbers,15,36,So the people took the man outside the camp. There they killed him by throwing stones at him. They did just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
Numbers,15,37,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Numbers,15,38,"“Say to the Israelites, ‘You must make tassels on the corners of your clothes. A blue cord must be on each tassel. You must do it for all time to come."
Numbers,15,39,You will have the tassels to look at. They will remind you to obey all the Lord ’s commands. Then you will be faithful to him. You will not chase after what your own hearts and eyes wish for.
Numbers,15,40,You will remember to obey all my commands. And you will be set apart for your God.
Numbers,15,41,I am the Lord your God. I brought you out of Egypt to be your God. I am the Lord your God.’ ”
Numbers,16,1,"Korah was the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath. Kohath was the son of Levi. Korah and certain men from the tribe of Reuben turned against Moses. The men from Reuben were Dathan, Abiram and On. Dathan and Abiram were the sons of Eliab. On was the son of Peleth."
Numbers,16,2,All those men rose up against Moses. And 250 men of Israel joined them. All of them were known as leaders in the community. They had been appointed as members of the ruling body.
Numbers,16,3,"They came as a group to oppose Moses and Aaron. They said to Moses and Aaron, “You have gone too far! The whole community is holy. Every one in it is holy. And the Lord is with them. So why do you put yourselves above the Lord ’s people?”"
Numbers,16,4,"When Moses heard what they said, he fell with his face to the ground."
Numbers,16,5,"Then he spoke to Korah and all his followers. He said, “In the morning the Lord will show who belongs to him. He will show who is holy. He’ll bring that person near him. He’ll bring the man he chooses near him."
Numbers,16,6,"Korah, here’s what you and all your followers must do. Get some shallow cups for burning incense."
Numbers,16,7,Tomorrow put burning coals and incense in them. Offer it to the Lord . The man the Lord chooses will be the one who is holy. You Levites have gone too far!”
Numbers,16,8,"Moses also said to Korah, “Listen, you Levites!"
Numbers,16,9,The God of Israel has separated you from the rest of the community of Israel. He has brought you near him to work at the Lord ’s holy tent. He has given you to the people so that you can serve them. Isn’t all that enough for you?
Numbers,16,10,He has already brought you and all the other Levites near him. But now you want to be priests too.
Numbers,16,11,You and all your followers have joined together against the Lord . Why are you telling Aaron you aren’t happy with him?”
Numbers,16,12,"Then Moses sent for Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab. But they said, “We won’t come!"
Numbers,16,13,You have brought us up out of a land that has plenty of milk and honey. You have brought us here to kill us in this desert. Isn’t that enough? Now do you also want to act as if you were ruling over us?
Numbers,16,14,"Besides, you haven’t brought us into a land that has plenty of milk and honey. You haven’t given us fields and vineyards of our own. Do you want to treat these men like slaves? No! We won’t come!”"
Numbers,16,15,"Then Moses became very angry. He said to the Lord , “Don’t accept their offering. I haven’t taken even a donkey from them. In fact, I haven’t done anything wrong to any of them.”"
Numbers,16,16,"Moses said to Korah, “You and all your followers must stand in front of the Lord tomorrow. You must appear there along with Aaron."
Numbers,16,17,Each man must get his shallow cup. He must put incense in it. There will be a total of 250 incense cups. Each man must bring his cup to the Lord . You and Aaron must also bring your cups.”
Numbers,16,18,So each of them got his cup. He put burning coals and incense in it. All the men came with Moses and Aaron. They stood at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
Numbers,16,19,Korah gathered all his followers together at the entrance to the tent. They opposed Moses and Aaron. Then the glory of the Lord appeared to the whole community.
Numbers,16,20,"The Lord said to Moses and Aaron,"
Numbers,16,21,“Separate yourselves from these people. Then I can put an end to all of them at once.”
Numbers,16,22,"But Moses and Aaron fell with their faces to the ground. They cried out, “God, you are the God who gives life and breath to all living things. Will you be angry with the whole community when only one man sins?”"
Numbers,16,23,"Then the Lord spoke to Moses. He said,"
Numbers,16,24,"“Tell the community, ‘Move away from the tents of Korah, Dathan and Abiram.’ ”"
Numbers,16,25,Moses got up. He went to Dathan and Abiram. The elders of Israel followed him.
Numbers,16,26,"Moses warned the community. He said, “Move away from the tents of these evil men! Don’t touch anything that belongs to them. If you do, the Lord will sweep you away because of all their sins.”"
Numbers,16,27,"So they moved away from the tents of Korah, Dathan and Abiram. Dathan and Abiram had already come out. They were standing at the entrances to their tents. Their wives, children and little ones were standing there with them."
Numbers,16,28,"Then Moses said, “What is about to happen wasn’t my idea. The Lord has sent me to do everything I’m doing. Here is how you will know I’m telling you the truth."
Numbers,16,29,"These men won’t die a natural death. Something will happen to them that doesn’t usually happen to people. If what I’m telling you doesn’t happen, then you will know that the Lord hasn’t sent me."
Numbers,16,30,"But the Lord will make something totally new happen. The ground will open its mouth and swallow them up. It will swallow up everything that belongs to them. They will be buried alive. When that happens, you will know that these men have disrespected the Lord .”"
Numbers,16,31,"As soon as Moses finished saying all these words, what he had said came true. The ground under them broke open."
Numbers,16,32,"It opened its mouth. It swallowed up those men. In fact, it swallowed up everyone who lived in their houses. It swallowed all Korah’s men. And it swallowed up everything they owned."
Numbers,16,33,They went down into the grave alive. Everything they owned went down with them. The ground closed over them and they died. And so they disappeared from the community.
Numbers,16,34,"All the Israelites around them heard their cries. They ran away from them. They shouted, “The ground is going to swallow us up too!”"
Numbers,16,35,Then the Lord sent down fire. It burned up the 250 men offering the incense.
Numbers,16,36,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Numbers,16,37,“Speak to Eleazar the priest. He is the son of Aaron. Remind him that the shallow cups are holy. He must take them out of the ashes. He must scatter the burning coals away from there.
Numbers,16,38,The men who sinned used those cups. And it cost them their lives. Hammer the cups into bronze sheets that will cover the altar. The cups were offered to the Lord . They have become holy. Let them serve as a warning to the Israelites.”
Numbers,16,39,So the priest Eleazar collected the bronze incense cups. They had been brought by the men who had been burned to death. He had them hammered out to cover the altar.
Numbers,16,40,"He did just as the Lord had directed Moses to tell him to do. The covering would be a reminder to the Israelites. It would remind them that no one except a son of Aaron should come and burn incense to the Lord . If people other than priests did that, they would become like Korah and his followers."
Numbers,16,41,"The next day the whole community of Israel told Moses and Aaron they weren’t happy with them. “You have killed the Lord ’s people,” they said."
Numbers,16,42,The community gathered together to oppose Moses and Aaron. The people walked toward the tent of meeting. Suddenly the cloud covered it. The glory of the Lord appeared.
Numbers,16,43,Then Moses and Aaron went to the front of the tent of meeting.
Numbers,16,44,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Numbers,16,45,“Get away from these people. Then I can put an end to all of them at once.” And Moses and Aaron fell with their faces to the ground.
Numbers,16,46,"Moses said to Aaron, “Take your incense cup. Put incense in it. And put burning coals from the altar in it. Then hurry to the people and pay for their sin. The Lord has begun to show his anger. The plague has started.”"
Numbers,16,47,So Aaron did as Moses said. He ran in among the people. The plague had already started among them. But Aaron offered the incense and paid for their sin.
Numbers,16,48,He stood between those alive and those dead. And the plague stopped.
Numbers,16,49,"But 14,700 people died from the plague. That doesn’t include those who had died because of what Korah did."
Numbers,16,50,Then Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance to the tent of meeting. The plague had stopped.
Numbers,17,1,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Numbers,17,2,“Speak to the Israelites. Get 12 walking sticks from them. Get one from the leader of each of Israel’s tribes. Write the name of each man on his walking stick.
Numbers,17,3,Write Aaron’s name on Levi’s walking stick. There must be one stick for the head of each of Israel’s tribes.
Numbers,17,4,Put the walking sticks in the tent of meeting. Place them in front of the ark where the tablets of the covenant law are kept. That is where I meet with you.
Numbers,17,5,The walking stick that belongs to the man I choose will begin to grow new shoots. The Israelites are never happy with what you do. I will put an end to what they are saying.”
Numbers,17,6,So Moses spoke to the Israelites. Their leaders gave him 12 walking sticks. They gave one for the leader of each of Israel’s tribes. Aaron’s walking stick was among them.
Numbers,17,7,Moses put the sticks in front of the Lord in the tent where the tablets of the covenant law were kept.
Numbers,17,8,The next day Moses entered the tent. He looked at Aaron’s walking stick. It stood for the tribe of Levi. Moses saw that it had begun to grow new shoots. It had also produced buds and flowers and almonds.
Numbers,17,9,Then Moses brought out all the walking sticks from in front of the Lord . He brought them to all the Israelites. They looked at them. And each man took his own walking stick.
Numbers,17,10,"The Lord said to Moses, “Put Aaron’s walking stick back in front of the ark where the tablets of the covenant law are kept. The stick will be kept there as a warning to those who refuse to obey. They are never happy with what I do. Aaron’s walking stick will put an end to what they are saying. Then they will not die.”"
Numbers,17,11,Moses did just as the Lord commanded him.
Numbers,17,12,"The Israelites said to Moses, “We’ll die! We are lost! All of us are lost!"
Numbers,17,13,Anyone who even comes near the Lord ’s holy tent will die. Are all of us going to die?”
Numbers,18,1,"The Lord spoke to Aaron. He said, “You, your sons and your family are in charge of the sacred tent. You will be responsible for sins connected with the tent. And you and your sons alone will be responsible for sins connected with the office of priest."
Numbers,18,2,Bring the Levites from your tribe to join you. They will help you when you and your sons serve at the tent of meeting. That is where the tablets of the covenant law are kept.
Numbers,18,3,"The Levites will work for you. They must do everything that needs to be done at the tent. But they must not go near anything that belongs to the sacred tent. And they must not go near the altar. If they do, they and you will die."
Numbers,18,4,They will help you take care of the tent of meeting. They will join you in all the work at the tent. No one else can come near you there.
Numbers,18,5,“You will be responsible for taking care of the sacred tent and the altar. Then I will not be angry with the Israelites again.
Numbers,18,6,I myself have chosen the Levites. I have chosen them from among the Israelites. They are a gift to you. I have set them apart to do the work at the tent of meeting.
Numbers,18,7,But only you and your sons can serve as priests. Only you and your sons can work with everything at the altar and behind the curtain. I am letting you serve as priests. It is a gift from me. Anyone else who comes near the sacred tent must be put to death.”
Numbers,18,8,"Then the Lord spoke to Aaron. He said, “I have put you in charge of the offerings brought to me. The Israelites will give me holy offerings. I will give all their offerings to you and your sons. They are the part that belongs to you. They are your share for all time to come."
Numbers,18,9,You will have a part of the very holy offerings. It is the part not burned in the fire. That part belongs to you and your sons. You will have a part of all the gifts the people bring me as very holy offerings. It does not matter whether they are grain offerings or sin offerings or guilt offerings.
Numbers,18,10,Eat your part as something that is very holy. Every male will eat it. You must consider it holy.
Numbers,18,11,“Part of the gifts the Israelites bring as wave offerings will be set aside. That part will also belong to you. I will give it to you and your sons and daughters. It is your share for all time to come. Everyone in your home who is ‘clean’ can eat it.
Numbers,18,12,“I will give you all the finest olive oil and grain the people give me. And I will give you all the finest fresh wine they give me. They give all those things as the first share of their harvest.
Numbers,18,13,All the first shares of the harvest they bring me will belong to you. Everyone in your home who is ‘clean’ can eat it.
Numbers,18,14,“Everything in Israel that is set apart to me belongs to you.
Numbers,18,15,Offer to me every male born first to its mother. It belongs to you. That includes humans and animals alike. But you must buy back every oldest son. Suppose certain animals are ‘unclean.’ Then you must buy back every male born first to its mother.
Numbers,18,16,"When they are a month old, you must buy them back. You must pay the price to buy them back. The price is set at two ounces of silver. It must be weighed out according to the standard weights used in the sacred tent."
Numbers,18,17,"“But you must not buy back any male calf, sheep or goat born first. They are holy. Splash their blood against the altar. And burn their fat as a food offering. Its smell pleases me."
Numbers,18,18,The meat will belong to you. It is just like the breast and the right thigh of the wave offering. Those parts belong to you.
Numbers,18,19,"Part of the holy offerings the Israelites bring to me will be set aside. No matter what it is, I will give it to you and your sons and daughters. It is your share for all time to come. It is a covenant of salt from me. The salt means that the covenant will last for all time to come for you and your children.”"
Numbers,18,20,"The Lord spoke to Aaron. He said, “You will not receive any part of the land I am giving to Israel. You will not have any share among them. I am your share. I am what you will receive among the Israelites."
Numbers,18,21,“The Israelites will give me a tenth of everything they produce. And I will give it to the Levites. They serve at the tent of meeting. I will give them the tenth for the work they do there.
Numbers,18,22,"From now on the Israelites must not go near the tent of meeting. If they do, they will be punished for their sin. They will die."
Numbers,18,23,The Levites will do the work at the tent of meeting. They will be responsible for any sins connected with the tent. This is a law that will last for all time to come. The Levites will not receive any share among the Israelites.
Numbers,18,24,"Instead, I will give the Levites the tenth as their share. It is the tenth that the Israelites bring me as an offering. That is why I said the Levites would not have any share of land among the Israelites.”"
Numbers,18,25,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Numbers,18,26,"“Speak to the Levites. Say to them, ‘You will receive the tenth from the Israelites. I will give it to you as your share. When I do, you must give a tenth of that tenth as an offering to the Lord."
Numbers,18,27,Your offering will be considered as if you gave grain from a threshing floor. It will be considered as juice from a winepress.
Numbers,18,28,"In that way, you also will bring an offering to the Lord . You will bring it from the tenth you receive from the Israelites. You must give the Lord ’s part to the priest Aaron. You must bring it from the tenth you receive."
Numbers,18,29,You must bring to the Lord a part of everything given to you. It must be the best and holiest part.’
Numbers,18,30,"“Say to the Levites, ‘You must bring the best part. Then it will be considered as if you gave grain from a threshing floor. It will be considered as juice from a winepress."
Numbers,18,31,You and your families can eat the rest of it anywhere. It is your pay for your work at the tent of meeting.
Numbers,18,32,Bring the best part of what you receive. Then you will not be guilty of holding anything back. You will not make the holy offerings of the Israelites “unclean.” You will not die.’ ”
Numbers,19,1,"The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron. He said,"
Numbers,19,2,“Here is what the law I have commanded requires. Tell the Israelites to bring you a young red cow. It must not have any flaws at all. It must never have pulled a load.
Numbers,19,3,Give it to Eleazar the priest. It must be taken outside the camp and killed in front of him.
Numbers,19,4,Then Eleazar the priest must put some of its blood on his finger. He must sprinkle the blood toward the front of the tent of meeting. He must do it seven times.
Numbers,19,5,"While he watches, the young cow must be burned. Its hide, meat, blood and guts must be burned."
Numbers,19,6,"The priest must get some cedar wood, branches of a hyssop plant, and bright red wool. He must throw them on the young cow as it burns."
Numbers,19,7,"After that, the priest must wash his clothes. He must also take a bath. Then he can come into the camp. But he will be ‘unclean’ until evening."
Numbers,19,8,The man who burns the young cow must wash his clothes. He must also take a bath. He too will be ‘unclean’ until evening.
Numbers,19,9,“A man who is ‘clean’ will gather up the ashes of the young cow. He must put them in a place that is ‘clean.’ The place must be outside the camp. The ashes must be kept by the community of Israel. They will be added to the special water. The water will be used to make people pure from their sin.
Numbers,19,10,The man who gathers up the ashes of the young cow must wash his clothes. He too will be ‘unclean’ until evening. This law is for the Israelites. It is also for the outsiders living among them. The law will last for all time to come.
Numbers,19,11,“Anyone who touches a dead person’s body will be ‘unclean’ for seven days.
Numbers,19,12,They must make themselves pure and ‘clean’ with the special water. They must do it on the third day. They must also do it on the seventh day. Then they will be ‘clean.’ But suppose they do not make themselves pure and ‘clean’ on the third and seventh days. Then they will not be ‘clean.’
Numbers,19,13,Anyone who touches a dead person’s body and does not make themselves pure and ‘clean’ makes my holy tent ‘unclean.’ They must be separated from Israel. The special water has not been sprinkled on them. So they are ‘unclean.’ And they remain ‘unclean.’
Numbers,19,14,“Here is the law that applies when a person dies in a tent. Anyone who enters the tent will be ‘unclean’ for seven days. Anyone in the tent will also be ‘unclean’ for seven days.
Numbers,19,15,And anything in it that is open and has no lid will be ‘unclean.’
Numbers,19,16,“Suppose someone is out in the country. And suppose they touch someone who has been killed by a sword. Or they touch someone who has died a natural death. Or they touch a human bone or a grave. Then anyone who touches any of those things will be ‘unclean’ for seven days.
Numbers,19,17,“Here is what I want you to do for someone who is ‘unclean.’ Put some ashes from the burned young cow into a jar. Pour fresh water on the ashes.
Numbers,19,18,Then a man who is ‘clean’ must dip branches of a hyssop plant in the water. He must sprinkle the tent with it. Everything that belongs to the tent must be sprinkled with it. The people in the tent must also be sprinkled. Anyone who has touched a human bone or a grave must be sprinkled. So must anyone who has touched someone who has been killed. And so must anyone who has touched someone who has died a natural death.
Numbers,19,19,The man who is ‘clean’ must sprinkle those who are ‘unclean.’ That must be done on the third and seventh days. On the seventh day those who are ‘unclean’ must be made pure and ‘clean.’ Those being made ‘clean’ must wash their clothes. They must take a bath. Then that evening they will be ‘clean.’
Numbers,19,20,But what if those who are ‘unclean’ do not make themselves pure and ‘clean?’ Then they must be separated from the community. They have made my holy tent ‘unclean.’ The special water has not been sprinkled on them. They are ‘unclean.’
Numbers,19,21,This law will apply to all those people for all time to come. “The man who sprinkles the special water must also wash his clothes. Anyone who touches the water will be ‘unclean’ until evening.
Numbers,19,22,Anything that an ‘unclean’ person touches becomes ‘unclean.’ And anyone who touches it becomes ‘unclean’ until evening.”
Numbers,20,1,In the first month the whole community of Israel arrived at the Desert of Zin. They stayed at Kadesh. Miriam died and was buried there.
Numbers,20,2,The people didn’t have any water. So they gathered together to oppose Moses and Aaron.
Numbers,20,3,"They argued with Moses. They said, “We wish we had died when our people fell dead in front of the Lord."
Numbers,20,4,Why did you bring the Lord ’s people into this desert? We and our livestock will die here.
Numbers,20,5,Why did you bring us up out of Egypt? Why did you bring us to this terrible place? It doesn’t have any grain or figs. It doesn’t have any grapes or pomegranates. There isn’t even any water for us to drink!”
Numbers,20,6,Moses and Aaron left the people. They went to the entrance to the tent of meeting. There they fell with their faces to the ground. Then the glory of the Lord appeared to them.
Numbers,20,7,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Numbers,20,8,“Get your walking stick. You and your brother Aaron gather the people together. Then speak to that rock while everyone is watching. It will pour out its water. You will bring water out of the rock for the community. Then they and their livestock can drink it.”
Numbers,20,9,So Moses took the walking stick from the tent. He did just as the Lord had commanded him.
Numbers,20,10,"He and Aaron gathered the people together in front of the rock. Moses said to them, “Listen, you who refuse to obey! Do we have to bring water out of this rock for you?”"
Numbers,20,11,Then Moses raised his arm. He hit the rock twice with his walking stick. Water poured out. And the people and their livestock drank it.
Numbers,20,12,"But the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron. He said, “You did not trust in me enough to honor me. You did not honor me as the holy God in front of the Israelites. So you will not bring this community into the land I am giving them.”"
Numbers,20,13,Those were the waters of Meribah. That’s where the Israelites argued with the Lord . And that’s where he was proven to be holy among them.
Numbers,20,14,"Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom. The messengers said, “The nation of Israel is your brother. They say, ‘You know about all the hard times we’ve had."
Numbers,20,15,Long ago our people went down into Egypt. We lived there for many years. The Egyptians treated us and our people badly.
Numbers,20,16,But we cried out to the Lord . He heard our cry. He sent an angel and brought us out of Egypt. “ ‘Now here we are at the town of Kadesh. It’s on the edge of your territory.
Numbers,20,17,Please let us pass through your country. We won’t go through any field or vineyard. We won’t drink water from any well. We’ll travel along the King’s Highway. We won’t turn to the right or the left. We’ll just go straight through your territory.’ ”
Numbers,20,18,"But the people of Edom answered, “We won’t let you pass through here. If you try to, we’ll march out against you. We’ll attack you with our swords.”"
Numbers,20,19,"The Israelites replied, “We’ll go along the main road. We and our livestock won’t drink any of your water. If we do, we’ll pay for it. We only want to walk through your country. That’s all we ask.”"
Numbers,20,20,"Again the people of Edom answered, “We won’t let you pass through here.” Then the people of Edom marched out against them. They came with a large and powerful army."
Numbers,20,21,Edom refused to let Israel go through their territory. So Israel turned away from them.
Numbers,20,22,The whole community of Israel started out from Kadesh. They arrived at Mount Hor.
Numbers,20,23,"It was near the border of Edom. There the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron. He said,"
Numbers,20,24,“Aaron will join the members of his family who have already died. He will not enter the land I am giving to the Israelites. Both of you refused to obey my command. You did it at the waters of Meribah.
Numbers,20,25,So get Aaron and his son Eleazar. Take them up Mount Hor.
Numbers,20,26,Take Aaron’s official robes off of him. Put them on his son Eleazar. Aaron will die on Mount Hor. He will join the members of his family who have already died.”
Numbers,20,27,Moses did just as the Lord had commanded. The three men went up Mount Hor while the whole community was watching.
Numbers,20,28,Moses took Aaron’s official robes off of him. He put them on Aaron’s son Eleazar. And Aaron died there on top of the mountain. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.
Numbers,20,29,The whole community found out that Aaron had died. So all the Israelites mourned for him for 30 days.
Numbers,21,1,The Canaanite king of the city of Arad lived in the Negev Desert. He heard that Israel was coming along the road to Atharim. So he attacked the Israelites. He captured some of them.
Numbers,21,2,"Then Israel made a promise to the Lord . They said, “Hand these people over to us. If you do, we will set their cities apart to you in a special way to be destroyed.”"
Numbers,21,3,The Lord gave Israel what they asked for. He handed the Canaanites over to them. Israel completely destroyed them and their towns. So that place was named Hormah.
Numbers,21,4,The Israelites traveled from Mount Hor along the way to the Red Sea. They wanted to go around Edom. But they grew tired on the way.
Numbers,21,5,"So they spoke against God and against Moses. They said, “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt? Do you want us to die here in the desert? We don’t have any bread! We don’t have any water! And we hate this awful food!”"
Numbers,21,6,Then the Lord sent poisonous snakes among the Israelites. The snakes bit them. Many of the people died.
Numbers,21,7,"The others came to Moses. They said, “We sinned when we spoke against the Lord and against you. Pray that the Lord will take the snakes away from us.” So Moses prayed for the people."
Numbers,21,8,"The Lord said to Moses, “Make a snake. Put it up on a pole. Then anyone who is bitten can look at it and remain alive.”"
Numbers,21,9,So Moses made a bronze snake. He put it up on a pole. Then anyone who was bitten by a snake and looked at the bronze snake remained alive.
Numbers,21,10,The Israelites moved on. They camped at Oboth.
Numbers,21,11,Then they started out from Oboth. They camped in Iye Abarim. It’s in the desert on the eastern border of Moab.
Numbers,21,12,From there they moved on. They camped in the Zered Valley.
Numbers,21,13,They started out from there and camped by the Arnon River. It’s in the desert that spreads out into the territory of the Amorites. The Arnon is the border of Moab. It’s between Moab and the Amorites.
Numbers,21,14,Here is what the Book of the Wars of the Lord says about it. “Sing about Zahab in Suphah and the valleys. Sing about the Arnon
Numbers,21,15,and the slopes of the valleys. They lead to the settlement called Ar. They lie along the border of Moab.”
Numbers,21,16,"From there the Israelites continued on to Beer. That was the well where the Lord spoke to Moses. He said, “Gather the people together. I will give them water to drink.”"
Numbers,21,17,"Then Israel sang a song. They said, “Spring up, you well! Sing about it."
Numbers,21,18,Sing about the well the princes dug. Sing about the well the nobles of the people dug. All their rulers were holding their scepters and walking sticks.” Then the Israelites went from the desert to Mattanah.
Numbers,21,19,They went from Mattanah to Nahaliel. They went from Nahaliel to Bamoth.
Numbers,21,20,And they went from Bamoth to a valley in Moab. It’s the valley where the highest slopes of Pisgah look out over a dry and empty land.
Numbers,21,21,"The Israelites sent messengers to speak to Sihon. He was the king of the Amorites. The messengers said to him,"
Numbers,21,22,“Let us pass through your country. We won’t go off the road into any field or vineyard. We won’t drink water from any well. We’ll travel along the King’s Highway. We’ll just go straight through your territory.”
Numbers,21,23,"But Sihon wouldn’t let Israel pass through his territory. He gathered his whole army together. Then he marched out into the desert against Israel. When he reached Jahaz, he fought against Israel."
Numbers,21,24,But Israel put him to death with their swords. They took over his land. They took everything from the Arnon River to the Jabbok River. But they didn’t take over any of the land of the Ammonites. That’s because the Ammonites had built strong forts along their border.
Numbers,21,25,The Israelites captured all the cities of the Amorites. Then they settled down in them. They captured the city of Heshbon. They also captured all the settlements around it.
Numbers,21,26,"Sihon, the king of the Amorites, ruled in Heshbon. He had fought against an earlier king of Moab. Sihon had taken from him all his land all the way to the Arnon River."
Numbers,21,27,"That’s why the poets say, “Come to Heshbon. Let it be built again. Let Sihon’s city be made as good as new."
Numbers,21,28,“Fire went out from Heshbon. A blaze went out from the city of Sihon. It burned up Ar in Moab. It burned up the citizens who lived on Arnon’s hills.
Numbers,21,29,"Moab, how terrible it is for you! People of Chemosh, you are destroyed! Chemosh has deserted his sons and daughters. His sons have run away from the battle. His daughters have become prisoners. He has handed all of them over to Sihon, the king of the Amorites."
Numbers,21,30,“But we have taken them over. Heshbon’s rule has been destroyed all the way to Dibon. We have destroyed them as far as Nophah. Nophah goes all the way to Medeba.”
Numbers,21,31,So Israel settled in the land of the Amorites.
Numbers,21,32,Moses sent spies to the city of Jazer. The Israelites captured the settlements around it. They drove out the Amorites who were there.
Numbers,21,33,Then they turned and went up along the road toward Bashan. Og was the king of Bashan. He and his whole army marched out. They went to fight against Israel at Edrei.
Numbers,21,34,"The Lord said to Moses, “Do not be afraid of Og. I have handed him over to you. I have given you his whole army. I have also given you his land. Do to him what you did to Sihon, the king of the Amorites. He ruled in Heshbon.”"
Numbers,21,35,So the Israelites struck down Og and his sons. And they wiped out his whole army. They didn’t leave anyone alive. They took over his land for themselves.
Numbers,22,1,Then the Israelites traveled to the plains of Moab. They camped along the Jordan River across from Jericho.
Numbers,22,2,Balak saw everything that Israel had done to the Amorites. Balak was the son of Zippor.
Numbers,22,3,"The Moabites were terrified because there were so many Israelites. In fact, the Moabites were filled with panic because of the Israelites."
Numbers,22,4,"The Moabites spoke to the elders of Midian. They said, “This huge mob is going to destroy everything around us. They’ll lick it up as an ox licks up all the grass in the fields.” Balak, the son of Zippor, was the king of Moab at that time."
Numbers,22,5,"He sent messengers to get Balaam. Balaam was the son of Beor. Balaam was at the city of Pethor near the Euphrates River. Pethor was in the land where Balaam had been born. Balak told the messengers to say to Balaam, “A nation has come out of Egypt. They are covering the face of the land. They’ve set up camp next to me."
Numbers,22,6,So come and put a curse on these people. They are too powerful for me. Maybe I’ll be able to win the battle over them. Maybe I’ll be able to drive them out of the land. I know that whoever you bless is blessed. And I know that whoever you cursed is cursed.”
Numbers,22,7,The elders of Moab and Midian left. They took with them the money they knew Balaam would ask for. They wanted him to use evil magic to figure things out for them. They came to where Balaam was. And they told him what Balak had said.
Numbers,22,8,"“Spend the night here,” Balaam said to them. “I’ll report back to you with the answer the Lord gives me.” So the Moabite officials stayed with him."
Numbers,22,9,"God came to Balaam. He asked, “Who are these men with you?”"
Numbers,22,10,"Balaam said to God, “Balak king of Moab, the son of Zippor, sent me a message."
Numbers,22,11,"He said, ‘A nation has come out of Egypt. They are covering the whole surface of the land. So come and put a curse on them for me. Maybe I’ll be able to fight them. Maybe I’ll be able to drive them away.’ ”"
Numbers,22,12,"But God said to Balaam, “Do not go with them. You must not put a curse on those people. I have blessed them.”"
Numbers,22,13,"The next morning Balaam got up. He said to Balak’s officials, “Go back to your own country. The Lord won’t let me go with you.”"
Numbers,22,14,"So the Moabite officials returned to Balak. They said, “Balaam wouldn’t come with us.”"
Numbers,22,15,Then Balak sent other officials. They were more important than the first ones. And there were more of them.
Numbers,22,16,"They came to Balaam. They said, “Balak, the son of Zippor, says, ‘Don’t let anything keep you from coming to me."
Numbers,22,17,I’ll make you very rich. I’ll do anything you say. So come and put a curse on those people for me.’ ”
Numbers,22,18,"But Balaam gave them his answer. He said, “Balak could give me all the silver and gold in his palace. Even then, I still couldn’t do anything at all that goes beyond what the Lord my God commands."
Numbers,22,19,Now spend the night here so that I can find out what else the Lord will tell me.”
Numbers,22,20,"That night God came to Balaam. He said, “These men have come to get you. So go with them. But do only what I tell you to do.”"
Numbers,22,21,Balaam got up in the morning. He put a saddle on his donkey. Then he went with the Moabite officials.
Numbers,22,22,But God was very angry when Balaam went. So the angel of the Lord stood in the road to oppose him. Balaam was riding on his donkey. His two servants were with him.
Numbers,22,23,The donkey saw the angel of the Lord standing in the road. The angel was holding a sword. He was ready for battle. So the donkey left the road and went into a field. Balaam hit the donkey. He wanted to get it back on the road.
Numbers,22,24,Then the angel of the Lord stood in a narrow path. The path went through the vineyards. There were walls on both sides.
Numbers,22,25,The donkey saw the angel of the Lord . So it moved close to the wall. It crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall. So he hit the donkey again.
Numbers,22,26,"Then the angel of the Lord moved on ahead. He stood in a narrow place. There was no room to turn, either right or left."
Numbers,22,27,The donkey saw the angel of the Lord . So it lay down under Balaam. That made him angry. He hit the donkey with his walking stick.
Numbers,22,28,"Then the Lord opened the donkey’s mouth. It said to Balaam, “What have I done to you? Why did you hit me these three times?”"
Numbers,22,29,"Balaam answered the donkey. He said, “You have made me look foolish! I wish I had a sword in my hand. If I did, I’d kill you right now.”"
Numbers,22,30,"The donkey said to Balaam, “I’m your own donkey. I’m the one you have always ridden. Haven’t you been riding me to this very day? Have I ever made you look foolish before?” “No,” he said."
Numbers,22,31,Then the Lord opened Balaam’s eyes. He saw the angel of the Lord standing in the road. He saw that the angel was holding a sword. The angel was ready for battle. So Balaam bowed down. He fell with his face to the ground.
Numbers,22,32,"The angel of the Lord spoke to him. He asked him, “Why have you hit your donkey three times? I have come here to oppose you. What you are doing is foolish."
Numbers,22,33,The donkey saw me. It turned away from me three times. Suppose it had not turned away. Then I would certainly have killed you by now. But I would have spared the donkey.”
Numbers,22,34,"Balaam said to the angel of the Lord , “I have sinned. I didn’t realize you were standing in the road to oppose me. Tell me whether you are pleased with me. If you aren’t, I’ll go back.”"
Numbers,22,35,"The angel of the Lord said to Balaam, “Go with the men. But say only what I tell you to say.” So Balaam went with Balak’s officials."
Numbers,22,36,Balak heard that Balaam was coming. So he went out to meet him. They met at a Moabite town near the Arnon River. The town was on the border of Balak’s territory.
Numbers,22,37,"Balak said to Balaam, “Didn’t I send messengers to you? I wanted you to come quickly. So why didn’t you come? I can make you very rich.”"
Numbers,22,38,"“Well, I’ve come to you now,” Balaam replied. “But I can’t say whatever I please. I can only speak the words God puts in my mouth.”"
Numbers,22,39,Then Balaam went with Balak to Kiriath Huzoth.
Numbers,22,40,Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep. He gave some to Balaam. He also gave some to the officials with him.
Numbers,22,41,The next morning Balak took Balaam up to Bamoth Baal. From there he could see the outer edges of the Israelite camp.
Numbers,23,1,"Balaam said to Balak, “Build me seven altars here. Prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me to sacrifice.”"
Numbers,23,2,Balak did just as Balaam said. The two of them offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
Numbers,23,3,"Then Balaam said to Balak, “Stay here beside your offering. I’ll go and try to find out what the Lord wants me to do. Maybe he’ll come and meet with me. Then I’ll tell you what he says to me.” So Balaam went off to a bare hilltop."
Numbers,23,4,"God met with him there. Balaam said, “I’ve prepared seven altars. On each altar I’ve offered a bull and a ram.”"
Numbers,23,5,"The Lord put a message in Balaam’s mouth. The Lord said, “Go back to Balak. Give him my message.”"
Numbers,23,6,So Balaam went back to him. He found Balak standing beside his offering. All the Moabite officials were with him.
Numbers,23,7,"Then Balaam spoke the message he had received from God. He said, “Balak brought me from the land of Aram. The king of Moab sent for me from the mountains in the east. ‘Come,’ he said. ‘Put a curse on Jacob’s people for me. Come. Speak against Israel.’"
Numbers,23,8,But how can I put a curse on people God hasn’t cursed? How can I speak against people the Lord hasn’t spoken against?
Numbers,23,9,I see them from the rocky peaks. I view them from the hills. I see a group of people who live by themselves. They don’t consider themselves to be one of the nations.
Numbers,23,10,Jacob’s people are like the dust of the earth. Can dust be counted? Who can count even a fourth of the Israelites? Let me die as godly people die. Let my death be like theirs!”
Numbers,23,11,"Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I brought you here to put a curse on my enemies! But all you have done is give them a blessing!”"
Numbers,23,12,"He answered, “I have to speak only the words the Lord puts in my mouth.”"
Numbers,23,13,"Then Balak said to Balaam, “Come with me to another place. You can see the Israelites from there. You won’t see all of them. You will only see the outer edges of their camp. From there, put a curse on them for me.”"
Numbers,23,14,So Balak took Balaam to the field of Zophim. It was on the highest slopes of Pisgah. There Balak built seven altars. He offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
Numbers,23,15,"Balaam said to Balak, “Stay here beside your offering. I’ll meet with the Lord over there.”"
Numbers,23,16,"The Lord met with Balaam. He put a message in Balaam’s mouth. The Lord said, “Go back to Balak. Give him my message.”"
Numbers,23,17,"So Balaam went to Balak. He found him standing beside his offering. The Moabite officials were with him. Balak asked him, “What did the Lord say?”"
Numbers,23,18,"Then Balaam spoke the message he had received from God. He said, “Balak, rise up and listen. Son of Zippor, hear me."
Numbers,23,19,"God isn’t a mere human. He can’t lie. He isn’t a human being. He doesn’t change his mind. He speaks, and then he acts. He makes a promise, and then he keeps it."
Numbers,23,20,He has commanded me to bless Israel. He has given them his blessing. And I can’t change it.
Numbers,23,21,“I don’t see any trouble coming on the people of Jacob. I don’t see any suffering in Israel. The Lord their God is with them. The shout of the King is among them.
Numbers,23,22,God brought them out of Egypt. They are as strong as a wild ox.
Numbers,23,23,"There isn’t any magic that can hurt the people of Jacob. No one can use magic words to harm Israel. Here is what will be said about the people of Jacob. Here is what will be said about Israel. People will say, ‘See what God has done!’"
Numbers,23,24,The Israelites are going to wake up like a female lion. They are going to get up like a male lion. They are like a lion that won’t rest until it eats what it has caught. They are like a lion that won’t rest until it drinks the blood of what it has killed.”
Numbers,23,25,"Then Balak said to Balaam, “Don’t put a curse on them at all! And don’t give them a blessing at all!”"
Numbers,23,26,"Balaam answered, “Didn’t I tell you that I must do only what the Lord says?”"
Numbers,23,27,"Then Balak said to Balaam, “Come. Let me take you to another place. Perhaps God will be pleased to let you put a curse on the Israelites for me from there.”"
Numbers,23,28,Balak took Balaam to the top of Mount Peor. It looks out over a dry and empty land.
Numbers,23,29,"Balaam said, “Build me seven altars here. Prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me to sacrifice.”"
Numbers,23,30,Balak did just as Balaam said. He offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
Numbers,24,1,"Balaam saw that the Lord was pleased to give his blessing to Israel. So he didn’t try to use evil magic as he had done at other times. Instead, he turned and looked toward the desert."
Numbers,24,2,He looked out and saw Israel. They had set up their camps tribe by tribe. The Spirit of God came on him.
Numbers,24,3,"Balaam spoke the message he had received from God. He said, “Here is the message God gave Balaam, the son of Beor. It’s the message God gave to the one who sees clearly."
Numbers,24,4,It’s the message God gave to the one who hears the words of God. He sees a vision from the Mighty One. He falls down flat with his face toward the ground. His eyes have been opened by the Lord.
Numbers,24,5,"“People of Jacob, your tents are very beautiful. Israel, the places where you live are very beautiful."
Numbers,24,6,“They spread out like valleys. They are like gardens beside a river. They are like aloes the Lord has planted. They are like cedar trees beside a stream.
Numbers,24,7,Their water buckets will run over. Their seeds will have plenty of water. “Their king will be greater than King Agag. Their kingdom will be honored.
Numbers,24,8,“God brought them out of Egypt. They are as strong as a wild ox. They destroy nations at war with them. They break their bones in pieces. They wound them with their arrows.
Numbers,24,9,Like a male lion they lie down and sleep. They are like a female lion. Who dares to wake them up? “May those who bless you be blessed! May those who curse you be cursed!”
Numbers,24,10,"Then Balak became very angry with Balaam. He slapped his hands together. He said to Balaam, “I sent for you to put a curse on my enemies. But you have given them a blessing three times."
Numbers,24,11,Get out of here right away! Go home! I said I’d make you very rich. But the Lord has kept you from getting rich.”
Numbers,24,12,"Balaam answered Balak, “Here is what I told the messengers you sent me."
Numbers,24,13,"I said, ‘Balak could give me all the silver and gold in his palace. Even if I wanted to, I still couldn’t do anything at all that goes beyond what the Lord commands. I must say only what the Lord tells me to say.’"
Numbers,24,14,Now I’m going back to my people. But come. Let me warn you about what these people will do to your people in days to come.”
Numbers,24,15,"Then Balaam spoke the message he had received from God. He said, “Here is the message God gave Balaam, the son of Beor. It’s the message God gave to the one who sees clearly."
Numbers,24,16,It’s the message God gave to the one who hears the words of God. The Most High God has given him knowledge. He sees a vision from the Mighty One. He falls down flat with his face toward the ground. His eyes have been opened by the Lord.
Numbers,24,17,"“I see him, but I don’t see him now. I view him, but he isn’t near. A star will come from among the people of Jacob. A king will rise up out of Israel. He’ll crush the foreheads of the people of Moab. He’ll crush the heads of all the people of Sheth."
Numbers,24,18,He’ll win the battle over Edom. He’ll win the battle over his enemy Seir. But Israel will grow strong.
Numbers,24,19,A ruler will come from among the people of Jacob. He’ll destroy those from the city who are still alive.”
Numbers,24,20,"Then Balaam saw the Amalekites. He spoke the message he had received from God. He said, “Amalek was the first nation to attack Israel. But their end will be total destruction.”"
Numbers,24,21,"Then Balaam saw the Kenites. He spoke the message he had received from God. He said, “The place where you live is safe. Your nest is on a high cliff."
Numbers,24,22,But you Kenites will be destroyed. Ashur will take you as prisoners.”
Numbers,24,23,"Then Balaam spoke the message he had received from God. He said, “Who can live when God does this?"
Numbers,24,24,Ships will come from the shores of Cyprus. They will bring Ashur and Eber under their control. But they themselves will also be destroyed.”
Numbers,24,25,Then Balaam got up and returned home. And Balak went on his way.
Numbers,25,1,Israel was staying in Shittim. The men of Israel began to commit sexual sins with the women of Moab.
Numbers,25,2,The women invited the men to feasts and sacrifices to honor their gods. The people ate the sacrifices and bowed down in front of the statues of those gods.
Numbers,25,3,So Israel joined in worshiping the god named Baal that was worshiped at Peor. The Lord became very angry with Israel.
Numbers,25,4,"The Lord said to Moses, “Take all the leaders of these people. Kill them. Put their dead bodies out in the open. I want to see you do it in the middle of the day. Then I will not be angry with Israel.”"
Numbers,25,5,"So Moses spoke to Israel’s judges. He said, “Some of your people have joined in worshiping the god named Baal that is worshiped at Peor. Each of you must kill the people in your tribe who have done that.”"
Numbers,25,6,Then an Israelite man brought into the camp a Midianite woman. He did it right in front of the eyes of Moses and the whole community of Israel. They were weeping at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
Numbers,25,7,"Phinehas was a priest. He was the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron. When Phinehas saw what had happened, he left the people. He took a spear in his hand."
Numbers,25,8,He followed the man into the tent. Phinehas stuck the spear through the man and into the woman’s stomach. Then the Lord stopped the plague against the Israelites.
Numbers,25,9,"But the plague had already killed 24,000 of them."
Numbers,25,10,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Numbers,25,11,"“Phinehas is a priest. He is the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron. Phinehas has turned my anger away from the Israelites. I am committed to making sure I am honored among them. And he is as committed as I am. So even though I was angry with them, I did not put an end to them."
Numbers,25,12,So tell Phinehas I am making my covenant with him. It is my promise to give him peace.
Numbers,25,13,"He and his sons after him will have a covenant to be priests forever. That is because he was committed to making sure that I, his God, was honored. In that way he paid for the sin of the Israelites.”"
Numbers,25,14,The name of the Israelite man who was killed was Zimri. He was the son of Salu. Zimri was killed along with the Midianite woman. Salu was a family leader in the tribe of Simeon.
Numbers,25,15,The name of the Midianite woman who was killed was Kozbi. She was the daughter of Zur. He was the chief of a Midianite family.
Numbers,25,16,"The Lord spoke to Moses. He said,"
Numbers,25,17,“Treat the Midianites just as you would treat enemies. Kill them.
Numbers,25,18,"After all, they treated you like enemies. They tricked you into worshiping the god named Baal that is worshiped at Peor. They also tricked you because of what Kozbi did. She was the woman killed when the plague came that was connected with Peor. Kozbi was the daughter of a Midianite leader.”"
Numbers,26,1,"After the plague, the Lord spoke to Moses and Eleazar the priest. Eleazar was the son of Aaron. The Lord said,"
Numbers,26,2,“Count all the men of Israel. Make a list of them by their families. Count all the men who are able to serve in Israel’s army. They must be 20 years old or more.”
Numbers,26,3,"At that time the Israelites were on the plains of Moab. They were by the Jordan River across from Jericho. Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them. They said,"

Numbers,26,51,"The total number of the men of Israel was 601,730."
Numbers,26,52,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Numbers,26,53,“I will give the land to them. The amount of land each family receives will be based on the number of its men.
Numbers,26,54,Give a larger share to a larger family. Give a smaller share to a smaller family. Each family will receive its share based on the number of men listed in it.
Numbers,26,55,“Be sure that you cast lots when you give out the land. What each family receives will be based on the number of men listed in its tribe.
Numbers,26,56,Cast lots when you give out each share. Cast lots for the larger and smaller families alike.”
Numbers,26,57,Here are the names of the Levites. They are listed by their families. The Gershonite family came from Gershon. The Kohathite family came from Kohath. The Merarite family came from Merari.
Numbers,26,58,"Here are the names of the other Levite families. They are the Libnite family, the Hebronite family, the Mahlite family, the Mushite family, the Korahite family. Amram came from the Kohathite family."
Numbers,26,59,"The name of Amram’s wife was Jochebed. She was from the family line of Levi. She was born to the Levites in Egypt. Aaron, Moses and their sister Miriam were born in the family line of Amram and Jochebed."
Numbers,26,60,Aaron was the father of Nadab and Abihu. He was also the father of Eleazar and Ithamar.
Numbers,26,61,But Nadab and Abihu made an offering to the Lord by using fire that wasn’t allowed. So they died.
Numbers,26,62,"The number of male Levites a month old or more was 23,000. They weren’t listed along with the other men of Israel. That’s because they didn’t receive a share among them."
Numbers,26,63,These are the men counted by Moses and Eleazar the priest. At that time the Israelites were on the plains of Moab. They were by the Jordan River across from Jericho.
Numbers,26,64,The men of Israel had been counted before in the Sinai Desert by Moses and Aaron the priest. But not one of them was among the men counted this time.
Numbers,26,65,"The Lord had told the Israelites at Kadesh Barnea that they would certainly die in the desert. Not one of them was left alive except Caleb and Joshua. Caleb was the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua was the son of Nun."
Numbers,27,1,"The daughters of Zelophehad belonged to the family groups of Manasseh. Zelophehad was the son of Hepher. Hepher was the son of Gilead. Gilead was the son of Makir. Makir was the son of Manasseh. And Manasseh was the son of Joseph. The names of Zelophehad’s daughters were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milkah and Tirzah. They approached"
Numbers,27,2,"the entrance to the tent of meeting. There they stood in front of Moses and Eleazar the priest. The leaders and the whole community were there too. Zelophehad’s daughters said,"
Numbers,27,3,“Our father died in the Sinai Desert. But he wasn’t one of the men who followed Korah. He wasn’t one of those who joined together against the Lord . Our father died because of his own sin. He didn’t leave any sons.
Numbers,27,4,Why should our father’s name disappear from his family just because he didn’t have a son? Give us property among our father’s relatives.”
Numbers,27,5,So Moses brought their case to the Lord.
Numbers,27,6,"The Lord said to him,"
Numbers,27,7,“What Zelophehad’s daughters are saying is right. You must certainly give them property. Give them a share among their father’s relatives. Give their father’s property to them.
Numbers,27,8,"“Say to the Israelites, ‘Suppose a man dies who doesn’t have a son. Then give his property to his daughter."
Numbers,27,9,Suppose the man doesn’t have a daughter. Then give his property to his brothers.
Numbers,27,10,Suppose the man doesn’t have any brothers. Then give his property to his father’s brothers.
Numbers,27,11,Suppose his father doesn’t have any brothers. Then give his property to the nearest male relative in his family group. It will belong to him. That is what the law will require of the Israelites. It is just as the Lord commanded me.’ ”
Numbers,27,12,"Then the Lord said to Moses, “Go up this mountain in the Abarim Range. See the land I have given the Israelites."
Numbers,27,13,"After you have seen it, you too will join the members of your family who have already died. You will die, just as your brother Aaron did."
Numbers,27,14,"The community refused to obey me at the waters of Meribah Kadesh in the Desert of Zin. At that time, you and Aaron did not obey my command. You did not honor me in front of them as the holy God.”"
Numbers,27,15,"Moses spoke to the Lord . He said,"
Numbers,27,16,"“ Lord , you are the God who gives life and breath to all living things. Please put someone in charge of this community."
Numbers,27,17,Have that person lead them and take care of them. Then your people won’t be like sheep without a shepherd.”
Numbers,27,18,"So the Lord said to Moses, “Joshua, the son of Nun, has the ability to be a wise leader. Get him and place your hand on him."
Numbers,27,19,Have him stand in front of Eleazar the priest and the whole community. Put him in charge while everyone is watching.
Numbers,27,20,Give him some of your authority. Then the whole community of Israel will obey him.
Numbers,27,21,Joshua will stand in front of Eleazar the priest. Eleazar will help him make decisions. Eleazar will get help from me by using the Urim. Joshua and the whole community of Israel must not make any move at all unless I command them to.”
Numbers,27,22,Moses did just as the Lord commanded him. He got Joshua and had him stand in front of Eleazar the priest and the whole community.
Numbers,27,23,Then Moses placed his hands on Joshua. And he put him in charge of the people. He did just as the Lord had directed through Moses.

Numbers,29,40,Moses told the Israelites everything the Lord had commanded him.
Numbers,30,1,"Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of Israel. He said, “Here is what the Lord commands."
Numbers,30,2,Suppose a man makes a special promise to the Lord . Or suppose he gives his word to do something. Then he must keep his promise. He must do everything he said he would do.
Numbers,30,3,“Suppose a young woman is still living in her father’s house. She makes a special promise to the Lord . Or she gives her word to do something.
Numbers,30,4,Suppose her father hears about her promise. And he doesn’t say anything to her about it. Then she must keep her promise. She must do what she agreed to do.
Numbers,30,5,But suppose her father doesn’t allow her to keep her promises when he hears about them. Then she doesn’t have to do what she promised or agreed to do. The Lord will set her free. He’ll do it because her father hasn’t allowed her to keep her promises.
Numbers,30,6,“Suppose she gets married after she makes a special promise. Or she gets married after agreeing to do something without thinking it through.
Numbers,30,7,Suppose her husband hears about what she did. And he doesn’t say anything to her about it. Then she must keep her promise. She must do what she agreed to do.
Numbers,30,8,But suppose her husband doesn’t allow her to keep her promises when he hears about them. Then she doesn’t have to do what she promised. She doesn’t have to do what she agreed to do without thinking it through. The Lord will set her free.
Numbers,30,9,“Suppose a widow makes a special promise. Or suppose she gives her word to do something. Then she must keep her promise. She must do what she agreed to do. The same rules apply to a woman who has been divorced.
Numbers,30,10,“Suppose a woman living with her husband makes a special promise. Or she gives her word to do something.
Numbers,30,11,Suppose her husband hears about what she did. He doesn’t say anything to her about it. And he doesn’t try to stop her from keeping her promises. Then she must keep all of them. She must do what she agreed to do.
Numbers,30,12,But suppose her husband doesn’t allow her to keep her promises when he hears about them. Then she doesn’t have to do what she promised. She doesn’t have to do what she agreed to do. Her husband has kept her from doing what she said she would do. The Lord will set her free.
Numbers,30,13,Her husband can let her keep any special promise she makes. Or he can refuse to let her keep it. Suppose she gives her word not to eat anything. Then her husband can let her keep her promise. Or he can refuse to let her keep it.
Numbers,30,14,But suppose day after day her husband doesn’t say anything to her about what she did. Then he lets her keep all her promises. He lets her do everything she agreed to do. That’s because he didn’t say anything to her when he heard about what she had done.
Numbers,30,15,But suppose some time after he hears about her promises he doesn’t let her keep them. Then she will be guilty. But he will bear the consequences for her guilt.”
Numbers,30,16,These are the rules the Lord gave Moses about a man and his wife. And these are the rules the Lord gave about a father and his young daughter still living at home.
Numbers,31,1,"The Lord spoke to Moses. He said,"
Numbers,31,2,"“Pay the Midianites back for what they did to the Israelites. After that, you will join the members of your family who have already died.”"
Numbers,31,3,"So Moses said to the people, “Prepare some of your men for battle. They must go to war against Midian. They will carry out the Lord ’s plan to punish Midian."
Numbers,31,4,"Send 1,000 men from each of the tribes of Israel into battle.”"
Numbers,31,5,"So Moses prepared 12,000 men for battle. There were 1,000 from each tribe. They came from the families of Israel."
Numbers,31,6,"Moses sent them into battle. He sent 1,000 from each tribe. Phinehas the priest went along with them. Phinehas was the son of Eleazar. Phinehas took some things from the sacred tent with him. He also took the trumpets. The trumpet blasts would tell the people what to do and when to do it."
Numbers,31,7,"They fought against Midian, just as the Lord had commanded Moses. They killed every man."
Numbers,31,8,"Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur and Reba were among the men they killed. Those men were the five kings of Midian. The Israelites also killed Balaam with their swords. Balaam was the son of Beor."
Numbers,31,9,"The Israelites captured the Midianite women and children. They took for themselves all the herds, flocks and goods."
Numbers,31,10,They burned down all the towns where the Midianites lived. They also burned all their camps.
Numbers,31,11,They carried off everything they had taken. That included the people and the animals.
Numbers,31,12,They brought back to Israel’s camp the prisoners and everything else they had taken. They took them to Moses and to Eleazar the priest. They brought them to the whole community. Israel was camped on the plains of Moab. They were by the Jordan River across from Jericho.
Numbers,31,13,Moses and Eleazar the priest went to meet them outside the camp. So did all the leaders of the community.
Numbers,31,14,Moses was angry with the officers of the army who had returned from the battle. Some of them were the commanders of thousands of men. Others were the commanders of hundreds.
Numbers,31,15,“Have you let all the women remain alive?” Moses asked them.
Numbers,31,16,“The women followed Balaam’s advice. They caused the Israelites to be unfaithful to the Lord . The people worshiped the god named Baal that was worshiped at Peor. So a plague struck them.
Numbers,31,17,Kill all the boys. And kill every woman who has slept with a man.
Numbers,31,18,But save for yourselves every woman who has never slept with a man.
Numbers,31,19,“Anyone who has killed a person must stay outside the camp for seven days. And anyone who has touched a person who was killed must do the same thing. On the third and seventh days you must make yourselves pure. You must also make your prisoners pure.
Numbers,31,20,"Make all your clothes pure and ‘clean.’ Everything made out of leather, goat hair or wood must be made pure and ‘clean.’ ”"
Numbers,31,21,"Then Eleazar the priest spoke to the soldiers who had gone into battle. He said, “Here is what the law the Lord gave Moses requires."
Numbers,31,22,"All your gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin and lead"
Numbers,31,23,"must be put through fire. So must everything else that doesn’t burn up. Then those things will be ‘clean.’ But they must also be made pure with the special water. In fact, everything that won’t burn up must be put through that water."
Numbers,31,24,On the seventh day wash your clothes. And you will be ‘clean.’ Then you can come into the camp.”
Numbers,31,25,"The Lord spoke to Moses. He said,"
Numbers,31,26,“Here is what you and Eleazar the priest and the family leaders of the community must do. You must count all the people and animals you captured.
Numbers,31,27,Divide up some of what you took with the soldiers who fought in the battle. Divide up the rest with the others in the community.
Numbers,31,28,"Set apart a gift for me. Take something from the soldiers who fought in the battle. Set apart one out of every 500 people, cattle, donkeys or sheep."
Numbers,31,29,Take my gift from the soldiers’ half. Give it to Eleazar the priest. It is my share.
Numbers,31,30,"Also take something from the half that belongs to the Israelites. Choose one out of every 50 people, cattle, donkeys, sheep or other animals. Give them to the Levites. They are responsible for taking care of my holy tent.”"
Numbers,31,31,So Moses and Eleazar the priest did just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
Numbers,31,32,"What the soldiers took included 675,000 sheep."
Numbers,31,33,"There were also 72,000 cattle"
Numbers,31,34,"and 61,000 donkeys."
Numbers,31,35,"And there were 32,000 women who had never slept with a man."
Numbers,31,36,"Here is the half that belonged to those who had fought in the battle. There were 337,500 sheep."
Numbers,31,37,"From among them, the Lord ’s gift was 675."
Numbers,31,38,"There were 36,000 cattle. From among them, the Lord ’s gift was 72."
Numbers,31,39,"There were 30,500 donkeys. From among them, the Lord ’s gift was 61."
Numbers,31,40,"There were 16,000 women. From among them, the Lord ’s gift was 32."
Numbers,31,41,Moses gave the gift to Eleazar the priest. It was the Lord ’s share. Moses did just as the Lord had commanded him.
Numbers,31,42,The other half belonged to the Israelites. Moses set it apart from what belonged to the fighting men.
Numbers,31,43,"The community’s half was 337,500 sheep,"
Numbers,31,44,"36,000 cattle,"
Numbers,31,45,"30,500 donkeys"
Numbers,31,46,"and 16,000 women."
Numbers,31,47,Moses chose one out of every 50 people and animals. He gave them to the Levites. They were accountable for taking care of the Lord ’s holy tent. Moses did just as the Lord had commanded him.
Numbers,31,48,Then the army officers went to Moses. Some of them were the commanders of thousands of men. Others were the commanders of hundreds.
Numbers,31,49,"All of them said to Moses, “We have counted the soldiers under our command. Not a single one is missing."
Numbers,31,50,"So we’ve brought an offering to the Lord . We’ve brought the gold each of us took in the battle. That includes armbands, bracelets, rings, earrings and necklaces. We’ve brought them in front of the Lord to pay for our sin.”"
Numbers,31,51,Moses and Eleazar the priest accepted the beautiful gold things from the army officers.
Numbers,31,52,The gold received from the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds weighed 420 pounds. Moses and Eleazar offered all of it as a gift to the Lord.
Numbers,31,53,Each soldier had taken things from the battle for himself.
Numbers,31,54,Moses and Eleazar the priest accepted the gold from all the commanders. They brought it into the tent of meeting. It reminded the Lord of the Israelites.
Numbers,32,1,The tribes of Reuben and Gad had very large herds and flocks. They looked at the lands of Jazer and Gilead. They saw that those lands were just right for livestock.
Numbers,32,2,"So they came to Moses and Eleazar the priest. They also came to the leaders of the community. They said,"
Numbers,32,3,"“We have seen the cities of Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah and Heshbon. We’ve seen Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo and Beon."
Numbers,32,4,All of them are in the land the Lord has brought under Israel’s control. This land is just right for livestock. And we have livestock.
Numbers,32,5,"We hope you are pleased with us,” they continued. “If you are, please give us this land. Then it will belong to us. But don’t make us go across the Jordan River.”"
Numbers,32,6,"Moses spoke to the people of Gad and Reuben. He said, “Should the rest of us go to war while you stay here?"
Numbers,32,7,The Lord has given the land of Canaan to the Israelites. So why would you want to keep them from going over into it?
Numbers,32,8,That’s what your fathers did. I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to check out the land.
Numbers,32,9,They went up to the Valley of Eshkol and looked at the land. Then they talked the Israelites out of entering the land the Lord had given them.
Numbers,32,10,"The Lord ’s anger was stirred up that day. So he made a promise. He said,"
Numbers,32,11,"‘Not one of those who were 20 years old or more when they came up out of Egypt will see the land. They have not followed me with their whole heart. I promised to give the land to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob."
Numbers,32,12,"But not one of the people who came up out of Egypt will see the land except Caleb and Joshua. Caleb is the son of Jephunneh, the Kenizzite. And Joshua is the son of Nun. They will see the land. They followed the Lord with their whole heart.’"
Numbers,32,13,The Lord became very angry with Israel. He made them wander around in the desert for 40 years. They wandered until all the people who had done evil in his sight had died.
Numbers,32,14,"“Now here you are, you bunch of sinners! You have taken the place of your fathers. And you are making the Lord even angrier with Israel."
Numbers,32,15,What if you turn away from following him? Then he’ll leave all these people in the desert again. And it will be your fault when they are destroyed.”
Numbers,32,16,"Then they came up to Moses. They said, “We would like to build pens here for our livestock. We would also like to build cities for our women and children."
Numbers,32,17,"But we will prepare ourselves for battle. We’re even ready to go ahead of the Israelites. We’ll march out with them until we’ve brought them to their place. While we’re gone, our women and children will live in cities that have high walls around them. That will keep them safe from the people living in this land."
Numbers,32,18,We won’t return to our homes until each of the Israelites has received their share of the land.
Numbers,32,19,We won’t receive any share with them on the west side of the Jordan River. We’ve already received our share here on the east side.”
Numbers,32,20,"Then Moses said to them, “Do what you have promised to do. Get ready to fight for the Lord."
Numbers,32,21,Prepare yourselves and go across the Jordan River. Fight for the Lord until he has driven out his enemies in front of him.
Numbers,32,22,"When the land is under the Lord ’s control, you can come back here. Your duty to the Lord and Israel will be over. Then the Lord will give you this land as your own."
Numbers,32,23,“But what if you fail to do your duty? Then you will be sinning against the Lord . And you may be sure that your sin will be discovered. It will be brought out into the open.
Numbers,32,24,So build up cities for your women and children. Make sheep pens for your flocks. But do what you have promised to do.”
Numbers,32,25,"The people of Gad and Reuben spoke to Moses. They said, “We will do just as you command."
Numbers,32,26,Our children and wives will remain here in the cities of Gilead. So will our flocks and herds.
Numbers,32,27,But we will prepare ourselves for battle. We’ll go across the Jordan River and fight for the Lord . We will do just as you have said.”
Numbers,32,28,"Then Moses gave orders about them to Eleazar the priest. He gave the same orders to Joshua, the son of Nun. He also spoke to the family leaders of the Israelite tribes."
Numbers,32,29,"He said, “The men of Gad and Reuben must get ready for battle. They must go across the Jordan River with you. They must help you fight for the Lord . They must stay with you until the land has been brought under your control. If they do, you must give them the land of Gilead as their own."
Numbers,32,30,But what if they don’t get ready for battle? What if they don’t go across the Jordan with you? Then they must accept a share with you in Canaan.”
Numbers,32,31,"The people of Gad and Reuben gave their answer. They said, “We will do what the Lord has said."
Numbers,32,32,We’ll get ready for battle. We’ll go across the Jordan into Canaan. We’ll fight for the Lord there. But the property we receive will be on this side of the Jordan River.”
Numbers,32,33,Then Moses gave their land to them. He gave it to the tribes of Gad and Reuben and half of the tribe of Manasseh. Manasseh was Joseph’s son. One part of that land had belonged to the kingdom of Sihon. He was the king of the Amorites. The other part had belonged to the kingdom of Og. He was the king of Bashan. Moses gave that whole land to those two and a half tribes. It included its cities and the territory around them.
Numbers,32,34,"The people of Gad built up the cities of Dibon, Ataroth and Aroer."
Numbers,32,35,"They built up Atroth Shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah,"
Numbers,32,36,Beth Nimrah and Beth Haran. They built a high wall around each of those cities. They also built sheep pens for their flocks.
Numbers,32,37,"The people of Reuben built up Heshbon, Elealeh and Kiriathaim."
Numbers,32,38,"They also built up Nebo, Baal Meon and Sibmah. They gave new names to the cities they had built up."
Numbers,32,39,"The people of Makir, the son of Manasseh, went to the land of Gilead. They captured it. They drove out the Amorites living there."
Numbers,32,40,"So Moses gave Gilead to the people of Makir, the son of Manasseh. And they settled there."
Numbers,32,41,Jair was from the family line of Manasseh. Jair captured Gilead’s settlements. He called them Havvoth Jair.
Numbers,32,42,Nobah captured Kenath and the settlements around it. He named it after himself.
Numbers,33,1,"Here are the places where the Israelites camped during their journey. When they came out of Egypt, they marched in groups like an army. Moses and Aaron led them."
Numbers,33,2,The Lord commanded Moses to record their journey. Here are the places where they camped.
Numbers,33,3,The Israelites started out from Rameses on the 15th day of the first month. It was the day after the Passover Feast. They marched out boldly in plain sight of all the Egyptians.
Numbers,33,4,The Egyptians were burying all their oldest sons. The Lord had struck them down. He had done it when he punished their gods.
Numbers,33,5,The Israelites left Rameses and camped at Sukkoth.
Numbers,33,6,They left Sukkoth and camped at Etham. Etham was on the edge of the desert.
Numbers,33,7,They left Etham and turned back to Pi Hahiroth. It was east of Baal Zephon. They camped near Migdol.
Numbers,33,8,They left Pi Hahiroth. Then they passed through the Red Sea into the desert. They traveled for three days in the Desert of Etham. Then they camped at Marah.
Numbers,33,9,They left Marah and went to Elim. Twelve springs and 70 palm trees were there. So they camped at Elim.
Numbers,33,10,They left Elim and camped by the Red Sea.
Numbers,33,11,They left the Red Sea and camped in the Desert of Sin.

Numbers,33,13,They left Dophkah and camped at Alush.

Numbers,33,16,They left the Desert of Sinai and camped at Kibroth Hattaavah.
Numbers,33,17,They left Kibroth Hattaavah and camped at Hazeroth.
Numbers,33,18,They left Hazeroth and camped at Rithmah.

Numbers,33,25,They left Haradah and camped at Makheloth.
Numbers,33,26,They left Makheloth and camped at Tahath.
Numbers,33,27,They left Tahath and camped at Terah.

Numbers,33,32,They left Bene Jaakan and camped at Hor Haggidgad.
Numbers,33,33,They left Hor Haggidgad and camped at Jotbathah.
Numbers,33,34,They left Jotbathah and camped at Abronah.
Numbers,33,35,They left Abronah and camped at Ezion Geber.
Numbers,33,36,They left Ezion Geber and camped at Kadesh. Kadesh was in the Desert of Zin.
Numbers,33,37,They left Kadesh and camped at Mount Hor. It was on the border of Edom.
Numbers,33,38,Aaron the priest went up Mount Hor when the Lord commanded him to. That’s where he died. It happened on the first day of the fifth month. It was the 40th year after the Israelites came out of Egypt.
Numbers,33,39,Aaron was 123 years old when he died on Mount Hor.
Numbers,33,40,The Canaanite king of Arad lived in the Negev Desert in Canaan. He heard that the Israelites were coming.
Numbers,33,41,They left Mount Hor and camped at Zalmonah.
Numbers,33,42,They left Zalmonah and camped at Punon.
Numbers,33,43,They left Punon and camped at Oboth.
Numbers,33,44,They left Oboth and camped at Iye Abarim. It was on the border of Moab.
Numbers,33,45,They left Iye Abarim and camped at Dibon Gad.
Numbers,33,46,They left Dibon Gad and camped at Almon Diblathaim.
Numbers,33,47,They left Almon Diblathaim and camped in the mountains of Abarim near Nebo.
Numbers,33,48,They left the mountains of Abarim and camped on the plains of Moab. That area was by the Jordan River across from Jericho.
Numbers,33,49,They camped there along the Jordan River from Beth Jeshimoth to Abel Shittim.
Numbers,33,50,"On the plains of Moab the Lord spoke to Moses. He spoke to him by the Jordan River across from Jericho. The Lord said,"
Numbers,33,51,"“Speak to the Israelites. Tell them, ‘Go across the Jordan River into Canaan."
Numbers,33,52,Drive out all those living in the land. The statues of their gods are made out of stone and metal. Destroy all those statues. And destroy all the high places where they are worshiped.
Numbers,33,53,Take the land as your own. Make your homes in it. I have given it to you.
Numbers,33,54,Cast lots when you divide up the land. Do it based on the number of people in each tribe and family. Give a larger share to a larger group. And give a smaller group a smaller share. The share they receive by casting lots will belong to them. Give out the shares based on the number of people in Israel’s tribes.
Numbers,33,55,“ ‘But suppose you do not drive out the people living in the land. Then those you allow to remain there will become like needles in your eyes. They will become like thorns in your sides. They will give you trouble in the land where you will live.
Numbers,33,56,Then I will do to you what I plan to do to them.’ ”
Numbers,34,1,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Numbers,34,2,"“Give the Israelites a command. Tell them, ‘You are going to enter Canaan. The land will be given to you as your own. Here are the borders it must have."
Numbers,34,3,“ ‘Your southern border will include part of the Desert of Zin. It will be along the border of Edom. Your southern border will start in the east from the southern end of the Dead Sea.
Numbers,34,4,It will cross south of Scorpion Pass. It will continue on to Zin. From there it will go south of Kadesh Barnea. Then it will go to Hazar Addar and over to Azmon.
Numbers,34,5,There it will turn and join the Wadi of Egypt. It will come to an end at the Mediterranean Sea.
Numbers,34,6,Your western border will be the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. That will be your border on the west.
Numbers,34,7,"For your northern border, run a line from the Mediterranean Sea to Mount Hor."
Numbers,34,8,Continue it from Mount Hor to Lebo Hamath. Then the border will go to Zedad.
Numbers,34,9,It will continue to Ziphron. It will come to an end at Hazar Enan. That will be your border on the north.
Numbers,34,10,"For your eastern border, run a line from Hazar Enan to Shepham."
Numbers,34,11,The border will go down from Shepham to Riblah. Riblah is on the east side of Ain. From there the border will continue along the slopes east of the Sea of Galilee.
Numbers,34,12,Then the border will go down along the Jordan River. It will come to an end at the Dead Sea. “ ‘That will be your land. And those will be its borders on every side.’ ”
Numbers,34,13,"Moses gave the Israelites a command. He said, “Cast lots when you divide up the land. Each tribe will have its own share. The Lord has ordered it to be given to the nine and a half tribes."
Numbers,34,14,The families of the tribes of Reuben and Gad have already received their shares. The families of half of the tribe of Manasseh have also received their share.
Numbers,34,15,Those two and a half tribes have received their shares east of the Jordan River. It flows near Jericho. Their land is toward the sunrise.”
Numbers,34,16,"The Lord spoke to Moses. He said,"
Numbers,34,17,"“Here are the names of the men who will give out the shares of the land to your people. They are Eleazar the priest and Joshua, the son of Nun."
Numbers,34,18,Also appoint one leader from each of the nine and a half tribes. They will help you give out the land.
Numbers,34,19,"“Here are their names. “Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, is from the tribe of Judah."
Numbers,34,20,"Shemuel, the son of Ammihud, is from the tribe of Simeon."
Numbers,34,21,"Elidad, the son of Kislon, is from the tribe of Benjamin."
Numbers,34,22,"Bukki, the son of Jogli, is the leader from the tribe of Dan."
Numbers,34,23,"Hanniel, the son of Ephod, is the leader from the tribe of Manasseh. Manasseh was the son of Joseph."
Numbers,34,24,"Kemuel, the son of Shiphtan, is the leader from the tribe of Ephraim. Ephraim was the son of Joseph."
Numbers,34,25,"Elizaphan, the son of Parnak, is the leader from the tribe of Zebulun."
Numbers,34,26,"Paltiel, the son of Azzan, is the leader from the tribe of Issachar."
Numbers,34,27,"Ahihud, the son of Shelomi, is the leader from the tribe of Asher."
Numbers,34,28,"Pedahel, the son of Ammihud, is the leader from the tribe of Naphtali.”"
Numbers,34,29,These are the men the Lord commanded to give out the shares of the land. They were commanded to give them to Israel in the land of Canaan.
Numbers,35,1,"On the plains of Moab, the Lord spoke to Moses. It was by the Jordan River across from Jericho. The Lord said,"
Numbers,35,2,“Command the Israelites to give the Levites towns to live in. The towns must come from the shares of land the people will have as their own. Also give the Levites the grasslands around the towns.
Numbers,35,3,Then the Levites will have towns to live in. They will also have grasslands for their cattle and all their other livestock.
Numbers,35,4,"“The grasslands around each town you give them will go out to 1,500 feet from the town wall."
Numbers,35,5,"Outside each town, the east side will measure 3,000 feet. So will the south side, the west side and the north side. The town must be in the center. And the Levites will own the grasslands around each town."
Numbers,35,6,“Six of the towns you give the Levites will be cities to go to for safety. A person who has killed someone can run to one of them. Also give the Levites 42 other towns.
Numbers,35,7,You must give the Levites a total of 48 towns. Also give them the grasslands around those towns.
Numbers,35,8,The towns you give the Levites must come from the land the Israelites have as their own. So the number you give from each tribe will depend on the size of that tribe’s share. Take many towns from a tribe that has many towns. But take only a few towns from a tribe that has only a few.”
Numbers,35,9,"Then the Lord said to Moses,"
Numbers,35,10,"“Speak to the Israelites. Tell them, ‘You will soon go across the Jordan River. You will enter Canaan."
Numbers,35,11,"When you do, choose the cities to go to for safety. People who have killed someone by accident can run to one of those cities."
Numbers,35,12,They will be places of safety for them. People will be safe there from those who want to kill them. Then anyone charged with murder will not die before their case has been brought to the community court.
Numbers,35,13,Six towns will be the cities you can go to for safety.
Numbers,35,14,Three will be east of the Jordan River. The other three will be in Canaan.
Numbers,35,15,Those six towns will be places where the Israelites can go for safety. Outsiders living in Israel can also go to them for safety. So anyone who has killed another person by accident can run there.
Numbers,35,16,“ ‘Suppose a person uses an iron object to hit and kill someone. Then that person is a murderer and must be put to death.
Numbers,35,17,Or suppose a person is holding a stone that could kill. And they use it to hit and kill someone. Then that person is a murderer and must be put to death.
Numbers,35,18,Or suppose a person is holding a wooden object that could kill. And they use it to hit and kill someone. Then that person is a murderer and must be put to death.
Numbers,35,19,"The dead person’s nearest male relative must kill the murderer. When he meets up with him, he must kill the murderer."
Numbers,35,20,What if a person makes evil plans against someone else? And what if that person pushes them so that they die? Or what if that person throws something at them so that they die?
Numbers,35,21,"Or what if that person hits another person with a fist so that the other dies? Then the person who does any of those things must be put to death. That person is a murderer. The dead person’s nearest male relative must kill the murderer. When he meets up with him, he must kill the murderer."
Numbers,35,22,“ ‘But what if a person suddenly pushes someone else without being angry? Or what if that person throws something at someone else without meaning to?
Numbers,35,23,Or what if that person does not see the other person and drops a stone on them that kills them? He was not the dead person’s enemy. He did not mean to harm them.
Numbers,35,24,Then the court must decide between the person who did the act and the nearest male relative of the one who was killed. Here are the rules the court must follow.
Numbers,35,25,The court must provide a safe place for the person accused of murder. It must keep the one accused of murder safe from those who want to kill them. The court must send the accused person back to the city they ran to for safety. The accused person must stay there until the high priest dies. That priest has been anointed with holy oil.
Numbers,35,26,“ ‘But suppose the accused person goes outside that city.
Numbers,35,27,And suppose the dead person’s nearest male relative finds them outside the city. Then the relative can kill the accused person. The relative will not be guilty of murder.
Numbers,35,28,The accused person must stay in that city until the high priest dies. Only then may they return home.
Numbers,35,29,“ ‘This is what the law requires of you for all time to come. It will apply to you no matter where you live.
Numbers,35,30,“ ‘Suppose a person kills someone. Then that person must be put to death as a murderer. But do it only when there are witnesses who can tell what happened. Do not put anyone to death if only one witness tells what happened.
Numbers,35,31,“ ‘Do not accept payment for a murderer’s life. A murderer deserves to die. They must certainly be put to death.
Numbers,35,32,“ ‘Do not accept payment for anyone who has run to a city for safety. Do not let them buy their freedom to return home. They must not go back and live on their own land before the high priest dies.
Numbers,35,33,“ ‘Do not pollute the land where you are. Murder pollutes the land. Only one thing can pay to remove the pollution in the land where murder has been committed. The blood of the one who spilled another’s blood must be spilled.
Numbers,35,34,"So do not make the land where you live “unclean,” because I live there too. I, the Lord , live among the Israelites.’ ”"
Numbers,36,1,The heads of the families of Gilead came to Moses. Gilead was the son of Makir. The family heads were from the tribe of Manasseh. So they were in the family line of Joseph. They spoke to Moses in front of the leaders of the families of Israel.
Numbers,36,2,"They said, “The Lord commanded you to give shares of the land to the Israelites. He told you to cast lots when you do it. At that time the Lord ordered you to give our brother Zelophehad’s share to his daughters."
Numbers,36,3,Suppose they marry men from other tribes in Israel. Then their share will be taken away from our family’s land. It will be added to the land of the tribe they marry into. So a part of the share given to us will be taken away.
Numbers,36,4,The Year of Jubilee for the Israelites will come. Then their share will be added to the land of the tribe they marry into. Their land will be taken away from the share given to our tribe.”
Numbers,36,5,"Then the Lord gave a command to Moses. He told Moses to give an order to the Israelites. Moses said, “What the tribe in the family line of Joseph is saying is right."
Numbers,36,6,Here is what the Lord commands for Zelophehad’s daughters. They can marry anyone they want to. But they have to marry someone in their own family’s tribe.
Numbers,36,7,Property in Israel must not pass from one tribe to another. Everyone in Israel must keep their family’s share of their tribe’s land.
Numbers,36,8,"Suppose a daughter in any tribe of Israel receives land from her parents. Then she must marry someone in her father’s family and tribe. In that way, every family’s share will remain in its family line in Israel."
Numbers,36,9,Property can’t pass from one tribe to another. Each tribe of Israel must keep the land it receives.”
Numbers,36,10,So Zelophehad’s daughters did just as the Lord commanded Moses.
Numbers,36,11,"The names of the daughters were Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milkah and Noah. All of them married their cousins on their father’s side."
Numbers,36,12,"They married men in the family line of Manasseh, the son of Joseph. So the land they received remained in their father’s family and tribe."
Numbers,36,13,These are the commands and rules the Lord gave through Moses. He gave them to the Israelites on the plains of Moab. They were by the Jordan River across from Jericho.
