Joshua,1,1,"Moses, the servant of the Lord , died. After that, the Lord spoke to Joshua, the son of Nun. Joshua was Moses’ helper. The Lord said to Joshua,"
Joshua,1,2,"“My servant Moses is dead. Now then, I want you and all these people to get ready to go across the Jordan River. I want all of you to go into the land I am about to give to the Israelites."
Joshua,1,3,"I will give all of you every place you walk on, just as I promised Moses."
Joshua,1,4,Your territory will reach from the Negev Desert all the way to Lebanon. The great Euphrates River will be to the east. The Mediterranean Sea will be to the west. Your territory will include all the Hittite country.
Joshua,1,5,"Joshua, no one will be able to oppose you as long as you live. I will be with you, just as I was with Moses. I will never leave you. I will never desert you."
Joshua,1,6,Be strong and brave. You will lead these people. They will take the land as their very own. It is the land I promised to give their people of long ago.
Joshua,1,7,“Be strong and very brave. Make sure you obey the whole law my servant Moses gave you. Do not turn away from it to the right or the left. Then you will have success everywhere you go.
Joshua,1,8,Never stop reading this Book of the Law. Day and night you must think about what it says. Make sure you do everything written in it. Then things will go well with you. And you will have great success.
Joshua,1,9,Here is what I am commanding you to do. Be strong and brave. Do not be afraid. Do not lose hope. I am the Lord your God. I will be with you everywhere you go.”
Joshua,1,10,"So Joshua gave orders to the officers of the people. He said,"
Joshua,1,11,"“Go through the camp. Tell the people, ‘Get your supplies ready. Three days from now you will go across the Jordan River right here. You will go in and take over the land. The Lord your God is giving it to you as your very own.’ ”"
Joshua,1,12,"Joshua also spoke to the tribes of Reuben and Gad and half of the tribe of Manasseh. He said to them,"
Joshua,1,13,"“Remember what Moses, the servant of the Lord , commanded you. He said, ‘The Lord your God is giving you this land. It’s a place where you can make your homes and live in peace and rest.’"
Joshua,1,14,"Your wives, children and livestock can stay here east of the Jordan River. Moses gave you this land. But all your fighting men must get ready for battle. They must go across ahead of the other tribes. You must help them"
Joshua,1,15,"until the Lord gives them rest. In the same way, he has already given you rest. You must help them until they also have taken over their land. It’s the land the Lord your God is giving them. After that, you can come back here. Then you can live in your own land. It’s the land that Moses, the servant of the Lord , gave you east of the Jordan River. It’s toward the sunrise.”"
Joshua,1,16,"Then the tribes of Reuben and Gad and half of the tribe of Manasseh answered Joshua. They said, “We’ll do what you have commanded us to do. We’ll go where you send us."
Joshua,1,17,"We obeyed Moses completely. And we’ll obey you just as completely. But may the Lord your God be with you, just as he was with Moses."
Joshua,1,18,Suppose people question your authority. And suppose they refuse to obey anything you command them to do. Then they will be put to death. Just be strong and brave!”
Joshua,2,1,"Joshua, the son of Nun, sent two spies from Shittim. He sent them in secret. He said to them, “Go and look over the land. Most of all, check out Jericho.” So they went to Jericho. They stayed at the house of a prostitute. Her name was Rahab."
Joshua,2,2,"The king of Jericho was told, “Look! Some of the Israelites have come here tonight. They’ve come to check out the land.”"
Joshua,2,3,"So the king sent a message to Rahab. It said, “Bring out the men who came into your house. They’ve come to check out the whole land.”"
Joshua,2,4,"But the woman had hidden the two men. She said, “It’s true that the men came here. But I didn’t know where they had come from."
Joshua,2,5,"They left at sunset, when it was time to close the city gate. I don’t know which way they went. Go after them quickly. You might catch up with them.”"
Joshua,2,6,But in fact she had taken them up on the roof. There she had hidden them under some flax she had piled up.
Joshua,2,7,"The king’s men left to hunt down the spies. They took the road that leads to where the Jordan River can be crossed. As soon as they had gone out of the city, the gate was shut."
Joshua,2,8,Rahab went up on the roof before the spies settled down for the night.
Joshua,2,9,"She said to them, “I know that the Lord has given you this land. We are very much afraid of you. Everyone who lives in this country is weak with fear because of you."
Joshua,2,10,"We’ve heard how the Lord dried up the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt. We’ve heard what you did to Sihon and Og, the two Amorite kings. They ruled east of the Jordan River. You completely destroyed them."
Joshua,2,11,"When we heard about it, we were terrified. Because of you, we aren’t brave anymore. The Lord your God is the God who rules in heaven above and on the earth below."
Joshua,2,12,"“Now then, please give me your word. Promise me in the name of the Lord that you will be kind to my family. I’ve been kind to you. Promise me"
Joshua,2,13,that you will spare the lives of my father and mother. Spare my brothers and sisters. Also spare everyone in their families. Promise that you won’t put any of us to death.”
Joshua,2,14,"So the men made a promise to her. “If you save our lives, we’ll save yours,” they said. “Just don’t tell anyone what we’re doing. Then we’ll be kind and faithful to you when the Lord gives us the land.”"
Joshua,2,15,The house Rahab lived in was part of the city wall. So she let the spies down by a rope through the window.
Joshua,2,16,"She said to them, “Go up into the hills. The men chasing you won’t be able to find you. Hide yourselves there for three days until they return. Then you can go on your way.”"
Joshua,2,17,"The spies had said to her, “You made us give our word. But we won’t keep our promise"
Joshua,2,18,"unless you do what we say. When we enter the land, you must tie this bright red rope in the window. Tie it in the window you let us down through. Bring your father and mother into your house. Also bring in your brothers and everyone else in your family."
Joshua,2,19,"None of you must go out into the street. If you do, anything that happens to you will be your own fault. We won’t be responsible. But if anyone hurts someone who is inside the house with you, it will be our fault. We will be responsible."
Joshua,2,20,"Don’t tell anyone what we’re doing. If you do, we won’t have to keep the promise you asked us to make.”"
Joshua,2,21,"“I agree,” Rahab replied. “I’ll do as you say.” So she sent them away, and they left. Then she tied the bright red rope in the window."
Joshua,2,22,"When the spies left, they went up into the hills. They stayed there for three days. By that time the men chasing them had searched all along the road. They couldn’t find them. So they returned."
Joshua,2,23,"Then the two spies started back. They went down out of the hills. They went across the Jordan River. They came to Joshua, the son of Nun. They told him everything that had happened to them."
Joshua,2,24,"They said, “We’re sure the Lord has given the whole land over to us. All the people there are weak with fear because of us.”"
Joshua,3,1,Early one morning Joshua and all the Israelites started out from Shittim. They went down to the Jordan River. They camped there before they went across it.
Joshua,3,2,After three days the officers went all through the camp.
Joshua,3,3,"They gave orders to the people. They said, “Watch for the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God. The priests, who are Levites, will be carrying it. When you see it, you must move out from where you are and follow it."
Joshua,3,4,"Then you will know which way to go. You have never gone this way before. But don’t go near the ark. Stay about 1,000 yards away from it.”"
Joshua,3,5,"Joshua said to the people, “Set yourselves apart to the Lord . Tomorrow he’ll do amazing things among you.”"
Joshua,3,6,"Joshua said to the priests, “Go and get the ark of the covenant. Walk on ahead of the people.” So they went and got it. Then they walked on ahead of them."
Joshua,3,7,"The Lord said to Joshua, “Today I will begin to honor you in the eyes of all the Israelites. Then they will know that I am with you, just as I was with Moses."
Joshua,3,8,"Speak to the priests who carry the ark of the covenant. Tell them, ‘When you reach the edge of the Jordan River, go into the water and stand there.’ ”"
Joshua,3,9,"Joshua said to the Israelites, “Come here. Listen to what the Lord your God is saying."
Joshua,3,10,"You will soon know that the living God is among you. He will certainly drive out the people now living in the land. He’ll do it to make room for you. He’ll drive out the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites and Jebusites."
Joshua,3,11,The ark will go into the Jordan River ahead of you. It’s the ark of the covenant of the Lord of the whole earth.
Joshua,3,12,Choose 12 men from the tribes of Israel. Choose one from each tribe.
Joshua,3,13,"The priests will carry the ark of the Lord . He’s the Lord of the whole earth. As soon as the priests step into the Jordan, it will stop flowing. The water that’s coming down the river will pile up in one place. That’s how you will know that the living God is among you.”"
Joshua,3,14,So the people took their tents down. They prepared to go across the Jordan River. The priests carrying the ark of the covenant went ahead of them.
Joshua,3,15,The water of the Jordan was going over its banks. It always does that at the time the crops are being gathered. The priests came to the river. Their feet touched the water’s edge.
Joshua,3,16,Right away the water coming down the river stopped flowing. It piled up far away at a town called Adam near Zarethan. The water flowing down to the Dead Sea was completely cut off. So the people went across the Jordan River opposite Jericho.
Joshua,3,17,The priests carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord . They stopped in the middle of the river and stood on dry ground. They stayed there until the whole nation of Israel had gone across on dry ground.
Joshua,4,1,"After the whole nation had gone across the Jordan River, the Lord spoke to Joshua. He said,"
Joshua,4,2,“Choose 12 men from among the people. Choose one from each tribe.
Joshua,4,3,Tell them to get 12 stones from the middle of the river. They must pick them up from right where the priests stood. They must carry the stones over with all of you. And they must put them down at the place where you will stay tonight.”
Joshua,4,4,So Joshua called together the 12 men he had appointed from among the Israelites. There was one man from each tribe.
Joshua,4,5,"He said to them, “Go back to the middle of the Jordan River. Go to where the ark of the Lord your God is. Each one of you must pick up a stone. You must carry it on your shoulder. There will be as many stones as there are tribes in Israel."
Joshua,4,6,"The stones will serve as a reminder to you. In days to come, your children will ask you, ‘What do these stones mean?’"
Joshua,4,7,Tell them that the Lord cut off the flow of water in the Jordan River. Tell them its water stopped flowing when the ark of the covenant of the Lord went across. The stones will always remind the Israelites of what happened there.”
Joshua,4,8,So the Israelites did as Joshua commanded them. They took 12 stones from the middle of the Jordan River. There was one stone for each of the tribes of Israel. It was just as the Lord had told Joshua. The people carried the stones with them to their camp. There they put them down.
Joshua,4,9,Joshua also piled up 12 stones in the middle of the river. He piled them up right where the priests who carried the ark of the covenant had stood. And they are still there to this very day.
Joshua,4,10,The priests who carried the ark remained standing in the middle of the Jordan River. They stayed there until the people had done everything the Lord had commanded Joshua. It was just as Moses had directed Joshua. All the people went across quickly.
Joshua,4,11,"As soon as they did, the ark of the Lord and the priests also went across to the other side. The people were watching them."
Joshua,4,12,Among the people who went across the river were men from the tribes of Reuben and Gad and half of the tribe of Manasseh. The men were ready for battle. They went across ahead of the rest of the Israelites. It was just as Moses had directed them.
Joshua,4,13,"There were about 40,000 of them. All of them were ready for battle. They went across in front of the ark of the Lord . They marched to the plains around Jericho. They were prepared to go to war."
Joshua,4,14,That day the Lord honored Joshua in the eyes of all the Israelites. They had respect for Joshua as long as he lived. They respected him just as much as they had respected Moses.
Joshua,4,15,"Then the Lord spoke to Joshua. He said,"
Joshua,4,16,“Command the priests to come up out of the Jordan River. They are carrying the ark where the tablets of the covenant law are kept.”
Joshua,4,17,"So Joshua gave a command to the priests. He said, “Come up out of the Jordan River.”"
Joshua,4,18,"Then the priests came up out of the river. They were carrying the ark of the covenant of the Lord . As soon as they stepped out on dry ground, the water of the Jordan began to flow again. It went over its banks, just as it had done before."
Joshua,4,19,On the tenth day of the first month the people went up out of the Jordan River. They camped at Gilgal on the eastern border of Jericho.
Joshua,4,20,Joshua set up the 12 stones at Gilgal. They were the ones the people had taken out of the Jordan.
Joshua,4,21,"Then he spoke to the Israelites. He said, “In days to come, your children after you will ask their parents, ‘What do these stones mean?’"
Joshua,4,22,"Their parents must tell them, ‘Israel went across the Jordan River on dry ground.’"
Joshua,4,23,The Lord your God dried up the Jordan for you until you had gone across it. He did to the Jordan River the same thing he had done to the Red Sea. He dried up the Red Sea ahead of us until we had gone across it.
Joshua,4,24,He did it so that all the nations on earth would know that he is powerful. He did it so that you would always have respect for the Lord your God.”
Joshua,5,1,"All the Amorite and Canaanite kings heard how the Lord had dried up the Jordan River. They heard how he had dried it up for the Israelites until they had gone across it. The Amorite kings lived west of the Jordan. The kings of Canaan lived along the Mediterranean Sea. When all those kings heard what the Lord had done, they were terrified. They weren’t brave enough to face the Israelites anymore."
Joshua,5,2,"At that time the Lord said to Joshua, “Make knives out of flint. Use them to circumcise the men of Israel.”"
Joshua,5,3,So Joshua made knives out of flint. Then he used them to circumcise the men of Israel at Gibeath Haaraloth.
Joshua,5,4,Here is why Joshua circumcised them. All the men who came out of Egypt had died. They died while they were wandering through the Sinai Desert. They were the men old enough to serve in the army.
Joshua,5,5,All the men who came out had been circumcised. But all the men born in the desert during the journey from Egypt hadn’t been circumcised.
Joshua,5,6,The Israelites had moved around in the desert for 40 years. By the end of that time all the men old enough to serve in the army when they left Egypt had died. That’s because they hadn’t obeyed the Lord . He had made a promise to them. He had told them they wouldn’t see the land. It’s the land he had promised to their people to give us. It’s a land that has plenty of milk and honey.
Joshua,5,7,"Because they hadn’t obeyed him, he raised up their sons to take their place. They were the ones Joshua circumcised. They hadn’t been circumcised yet. That’s because no one had circumcised them during the journey."
Joshua,5,8,So Joshua circumcised all those men. The whole nation remained in the camp until the men were healed.
Joshua,5,9,"Then the Lord spoke to Joshua. He said, “Today I have taken away from you the shame of being slaves in Egypt.” That’s why the place where the men were circumcised has been called Gilgal to this very day."
Joshua,5,10,The Israelites celebrated the Passover Feast. They observed it on the evening of the 14th day of the month. They did it while they were camped at Gilgal on the plains around Jericho.
Joshua,5,11,"The day after the Passover, they ate some of the food grown in the land. On that same day they ate grain that had been cooked. They also ate bread made without yeast."
Joshua,5,12,"The manna stopped coming down the day after they ate the food grown in the land. The Israelites didn’t have manna anymore. Instead, that year they ate food grown in Canaan."
Joshua,5,13,"When Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him. The man was holding a sword. He was ready for battle. Joshua went up to him. He asked, “Are you on our side? Or are you on the side of our enemies?”"
Joshua,5,14,"“I am not on either side,” he replied. “I have come as the commander of the Lord ’s army.” Then Joshua fell with his face to the ground. He asked the man, “What message does my Lord have for me?”"
Joshua,5,15,"The commander of the Lord ’s army replied, “Take off your sandals. The place you are standing on is holy ground.” So Joshua took them off."
Joshua,6,1,The gates of Jericho were shut tight and guarded closely because of the Israelites. No one went out. No one came in.
Joshua,6,2,"Then the Lord said to Joshua, “I have handed Jericho over to you. I have also handed over to you its king and its fighting men."
Joshua,6,3,"March around the city once with all your fighting men. In fact, do it for six days."
Joshua,6,4,"Have seven priests get trumpets made out of rams’ horns. They must carry them in front of the ark. On the seventh day, march around the city seven times. Tell the priests to blow the trumpets as you march."
Joshua,6,5,"You will hear them blow a long blast on the trumpets. When you do, tell the whole army to give a loud shout. The wall of the city will fall down. Then the whole army will march up to the city. Everyone will go straight in.”"
Joshua,6,6,"So Joshua, the son of Nun, called for the priests. He said to them, “Go and get the ark of the covenant of the Lord . I want seven of you to carry trumpets in front of it.”"
Joshua,6,7,"He gave an order to the army. He said, “Move out! March around the city. Some of the fighting men must march in front of the ark of the Lord .”"
Joshua,6,8,"When Joshua had spoken to the men, the seven priests went forward. They were carrying the seven trumpets as they marched in front of the ark of the Lord . They were blowing the trumpets. The ark of the Lord ’s covenant was carried behind the priests."
Joshua,6,9,Some of the fighting men marched ahead of the priests who were blowing the trumpets. The others followed behind the ark and guarded all the priests. That whole time the priests were blowing the trumpets.
Joshua,6,10,"But Joshua had given an order to the army. He had said, “Don’t give a war cry. Don’t raise your voices. Don’t say a word until the day I tell you to shout. Then shout!”"
Joshua,6,11,So he had the ark of the Lord carried around the city once. Then the army returned to camp. They spent the night there.
Joshua,6,12,Joshua got up early the next morning. The priests went and got the ark of the Lord.
Joshua,6,13,The seven priests carrying the seven trumpets started out. They marched in front of the ark of the Lord . They blew the trumpets. Some of the fighting men marched ahead of them. The others followed behind the ark and guarded all of them. The priests kept blowing the trumpets.
Joshua,6,14,On the second day they marched around the city once. Then the army returned to camp. They did all those things for six days.
Joshua,6,15,"On the seventh day, they got up at sunrise. They marched around the city, just as they had done before. But on that day they went around it seven times."
Joshua,6,16,"On the seventh time around, the priests blew a long blast on the trumpets. Then Joshua gave a command to the army. He said, “Shout! The Lord has given you the city!"
Joshua,6,17,The city and everything in it must be set apart to the Lord to be destroyed. But the prostitute Rahab and all those with her in her house must be spared. That’s because she hid the spies we sent.
Joshua,6,18,"But keep away from the things that have been set apart to the Lord . If you take any of them, you will be destroyed. And you will bring trouble on the camp of Israel. You will cause it to be destroyed."
Joshua,6,19,All the silver and gold is holy. It is set apart to the Lord . So are all the things made out of bronze and iron. All those things must be added to the treasures kept in the Lord ’s house.”
Joshua,6,20,"The priests blew the trumpets. As soon as the army heard the sound, they gave a loud shout. Then the wall fell down. Everyone charged straight in. So they took the city."
Joshua,6,21,"They set it apart to the Lord to be destroyed. They destroyed every living thing in it with their swords. They killed men and women. They wiped out young people and old people. They destroyed cattle, sheep and donkeys."
Joshua,6,22,"Then Joshua spoke to the two men who had gone in to check out the land. He said, “Go into the prostitute’s house. Bring her out. Also bring out everyone with her. That’s what you promised her you would do.”"
Joshua,6,23,So the young men who had checked out the land went into Rahab’s house. They brought her out along with her parents and brothers and sisters. They brought out everyone else there with her. They put them in a place outside the camp of Israel.
Joshua,6,24,Then they burned the whole city and everything in it. But they added the silver and gold to the treasures kept in the Lord ’s house. They also put there the things made out of bronze and iron.
Joshua,6,25,But Joshua spared the prostitute Rahab. He spared her family. He also spared everyone else in the house with her. He did it because she hid the spies he had sent to Jericho. Rahab lives among the Israelites to this day.
Joshua,6,26,"At that time Joshua made a promise and called down a curse. He said, “May the person who tries to rebuild this city of Jericho be under the Lord ’s curse. “If that person lays its foundations, it will cost the life of his oldest son. If he sets up its gates, it will cost the life of his youngest son.”"
Joshua,6,27,So the Lord was with Joshua. And Joshua became famous everywhere in the land.
Joshua,7,1,But the Israelites weren’t faithful to the Lord . They didn’t destroy what had been set apart to him. So they did not do what they had been told to do. Achan had taken some of those things. So the Lord became very angry with Israel. Achan was the son of Karmi. Karmi was the son of Zimri. And Zimri was the son of Zerah. Achan and all his relatives were from the tribe of Judah.
Joshua,7,2,"Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai. Ai is near Beth Aven east of Bethel. Joshua told the men, “Go up and check out the area around Ai.” So the men went up and checked it out."
Joshua,7,3,"Then they returned to Joshua. They said, “The whole army doesn’t have to go up and attack Ai. Send only two or three thousand men. They can take the city. Don’t make the whole army go up there. Only a few people live in Ai.”"
Joshua,7,4,"So only about 3,000 troops went up. But the men of Ai drove them away."
Joshua,7,5,They chased the Israelites from the city gate all the way to Shebarim. They killed about 36 of them on the way down. So the Israelites were terrified.
Joshua,7,6,Joshua and the elders of Israel became sad. Joshua tore his clothes. He fell in front of the ark of the Lord with his face to the ground. He remained there until evening. The elders did the same thing. They also sprinkled dust on their heads.
Joshua,7,7,"Joshua said, “ Lord and King, why did you ever bring these people across the Jordan River? Did you want to hand us over to the Amorites? Did you want them to destroy us? I wish we had been content to stay on the other side of the Jordan!"
Joshua,7,8,"Lord, our enemies have driven us away. What can I say?"
Joshua,7,9,The Canaanites will hear about it. So will everyone else in the country. They will surround us. They’ll erase any mention of our name from the face of the earth. Then what will you do when people don’t honor your great name anymore?”
Joshua,7,10,"The Lord said to Joshua, “Get up! What are you doing down there on your face?"
Joshua,7,11,Israel has sinned. I made a covenant with them. I commanded them to keep it. But they have broken it. They have taken some of the things that had been set apart to me in a special way to be destroyed. They have stolen. They have lied. They have taken the things they stole and have put them with their own things.
Joshua,7,12,"That is why the Israelites can’t stand up against their enemies. They turn their backs and run. That’s because I have decided to let them be destroyed. You must destroy the things you took that had been set apart to me. If you do not, I will not be with you anymore."
Joshua,7,13,"“Go and set the people apart. Tell them, ‘Make yourselves pure. Get ready for tomorrow. Here is what the Lord , the God of Israel, wants you to do. He says, “People of Israel, you have kept some of the things that had been set apart to me to be destroyed. You can’t stand up against your enemies until you get rid of those things.”"
Joshua,7,14,"“ ‘In the morning, come forward tribe by tribe. The tribe the Lord chooses will come forward group by group. The group the Lord chooses will come forward family by family. And the men in the family the Lord chooses will come forward one by one."
Joshua,7,15,Whoever is caught with the things that had been set apart to the Lord will be destroyed by fire. Everything that belongs to that person will also be destroyed. He has broken the Lord ’s covenant. He has done a very terrible thing in Israel!’ ”
Joshua,7,16,Early the next morning Joshua had Israel come forward by tribes. The tribe of Judah was chosen.
Joshua,7,17,The groups of Judah came forward. The group of Zerah was chosen. Joshua had the group of Zerah come forward by families. The family of Zimri was chosen.
Joshua,7,18,He had their men come forward one by one. Achan was chosen. Achan was the son of Karmi. Karmi was the son of Zimri. And Zimri was the son of Zerah. Zerah was from the tribe of Judah.
Joshua,7,19,"Joshua said to Achan, “My son, the Lord is the God of Israel. So give him glory and honor him by telling the truth! Tell me what you have done. Don’t hide it from me.”"
Joshua,7,20,"Achan replied, “It’s true! I’ve sinned against the Lord , the God of Israel. Here is what I’ve done."
Joshua,7,21,"I saw a beautiful robe from Babylonia among the things we had taken. I saw five pounds of silver. And I saw a gold bar that weighed 20 ounces. I wanted them, so I took them. I hid them in the ground inside my tent. The silver is on the bottom.”"
Joshua,7,22,"So Joshua sent some messengers. They ran to Achan’s tent. And there was everything, hidden in his tent! The silver was on the bottom."
Joshua,7,23,They brought the things out of the tent. They took them to Joshua and all the Israelites. And they spread them out in the sight of the Lord.
Joshua,7,24,"Then Joshua and all the people grabbed Achan, the son of Zerah. They took the silver, the robe and the gold bar. They took Achan’s sons and daughters. They took his cattle, donkeys and sheep. They also took his tent and everything he had. They carried all of it out to the Valley of Achor."
Joshua,7,25,"Joshua said to Achan, “Why have you brought this trouble on us? The Lord will bring trouble on you today.” Then all the people killed Achan by throwing stones at him. They also killed the rest of his family with stones. They burned all of them up."
Joshua,7,26,"They placed a large pile of rocks on top of Achan’s body. The place has been called the Valley of Achor ever since. That pile is still there to this day. After the people killed Achan, the Lord was no longer angry with them."
Joshua,8,1,"Then the Lord said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid. Do not lose hope. Go up and attack Ai. Take the whole army with you. I have handed the king of Ai over to you. I have given you his people, his city and his land."
Joshua,8,2,Remember what you did to Jericho and its king. You will do the same thing to Ai and its king. But this time you can keep for yourselves the livestock and everything else you take from them. Have some of your fighting men hide behind the city and take them by surprise.”
Joshua,8,3,"So Joshua and the whole army moved out to attack Ai. He chose 30,000 of his best fighting men. He sent them out at night."
Joshua,8,4,"He gave them orders. He said, “Listen carefully to what I’m saying. You must hide behind the city. Don’t go very far away from it. All of you must be ready to attack it."
Joshua,8,5,"I and all those with me will march up to the city. The men of Ai will come out to fight against us, just as they did before. Then we’ll run away from them."
Joshua,8,6,"They’ll chase us until we’ve drawn them away from the city. They’ll say, ‘They are running away from us, just as they did before.’ When we run away from them,"
Joshua,8,7,come out of your hiding place. Capture the city. The Lord your God will hand it over to you.
Joshua,8,8,"When you have taken it, set it on fire. Do what the Lord has commanded. Make sure you obey my orders.”"
Joshua,8,9,Then Joshua sent them away. They went to the place where they had planned to hide. They hid in a place west of Ai. It was between Bethel and Ai. But Joshua spent that night with his troops.
Joshua,8,10,Early the next morning Joshua brought together his army. He and the leaders of Israel marched in front of them to Ai.
Joshua,8,11,The whole army that was with him marched up to the city. They stopped in front of it. They set up camp north of Ai. There was a valley between them and the city.
Joshua,8,12,"Joshua had chosen about 5,000 soldiers. He had ordered them to hide in a place west of Ai. It was between Bethel and Ai."
Joshua,8,13,The men took up their battle positions. All the men in the camp north of the city took up their positions. So did those who were supposed to hide west of the city. That night Joshua went into the valley.
Joshua,8,14,The king of Ai saw what the troops with Joshua were doing. So the king and all his men hurried out of the city early in the morning. They marched out to meet Israel in battle. They went to a place that looked out over the Arabah Valley. The king didn’t know that some of Israel’s fighting men were hiding behind the city.
Joshua,8,15,Joshua and all his men let the men of Ai drive them back. The Israelites ran away toward the desert.
Joshua,8,16,All the men of Ai were called out to chase them. They chased Joshua. So they were drawn away from the city.
Joshua,8,17,"Not even one man remained in Ai or Bethel. All of them went out to chase Israel. When they did, they left the city wide open."
Joshua,8,18,"Then the Lord said to Joshua, “Hold out toward Ai the javelin that is in your hand. I will give the city to you.” So Joshua held out toward the city the javelin in his hand."
Joshua,8,19,"As soon as he did, the men hiding behind the city got up quickly. They came out of their hiding places and rushed forward. They entered the city and captured it. They quickly set it on fire."
Joshua,8,20,The men of Ai looked back. They saw smoke rising up from the city into the sky. But they couldn’t escape in any direction. The Israelites had been running away toward the desert. But now they turned around to face those chasing them.
Joshua,8,21,Joshua and all his men saw that the men who had been hiding behind the city had captured it. They also saw that smoke was going up from it. So they turned around and attacked the men of Ai.
Joshua,8,22,The men who had set Ai on fire came out of the city. They also fought against the men of Ai. So the men of Ai were caught in the middle. The army of Israel was on both sides of them. Israel struck them down. They didn’t let anyone remain alive or get away.
Joshua,8,23,But they captured the king of Ai alive. They brought him to Joshua.
Joshua,8,24,Israel finished killing all the men of Ai. They destroyed them in the fields and in the desert where they had chased them. They struck down every one of them with their swords. Then all the Israelites returned to Ai. And they killed those who were left in it.
Joshua,8,25,"The total number of men and women they killed that day was 12,000. The Israelites put to death all the people of Ai."
Joshua,8,26,Joshua continued to hold out his javelin toward Ai. He didn’t lower his hand until he and his men had totally destroyed everyone who lived there.
Joshua,8,27,But this time Israel kept for themselves the livestock and everything else they had taken from the city. The Lord had directed Joshua to let them do it.
Joshua,8,28,So Joshua burned down Ai. He tore it down so it could never be built again. It has been deserted to this very day.
Joshua,8,29,"Joshua killed the king of Ai. He stuck a pole through the body. Then he set it up where people could see it. He left it there until evening. At sunset, Joshua ordered his men to remove the body from the pole. He told them to throw the body down at the entrance of the city gate. They put a large pile of rocks over the body. That pile is still there to this day."
Joshua,8,30,"Joshua built an altar to honor the Lord , the God of Israel. He built it on Mount Ebal."
Joshua,8,31,"Moses, the servant of the Lord , had commanded the Israelites to do that. Joshua built the altar according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses. Joshua built the altar out of stones that iron tools had never touched. Then the people offered on the altar burnt offerings to the Lord . They also sacrificed friendship offerings on it."
Joshua,8,32,Joshua copied the law of Moses on stones. He did it while all the Israelites were watching.
Joshua,8,33,"They were standing on both sides of the ark of the covenant of the Lord . All the Israelites, including outsiders and citizens, were there. Israel’s elders, officials and judges were also there. All of them faced the priests, who were Levites. They were carrying the ark. Half of the people stood in front of Mount Gerizim. The other half stood in front of Mount Ebal. Moses, the servant of the Lord , had earlier told them to do it. Moses told them to do it when he had given directions to bless the Israelites."
Joshua,8,34,Then Joshua read all the words of the law out loud. He read the blessings and the curses. He read them just as they are written in the Book of the Law.
Joshua,8,35,Joshua read every word Moses had commanded. He read them to the whole community of Israel. That included the women and children. It also included the outsiders living among them.
Joshua,9,1,"All the kings who ruled west of the Jordan River heard about the battles Israel had won. That included the kings who ruled in the central hill country and the western hills. It also included those who ruled along the entire coast of the Mediterranean Sea all the way to Lebanon. They were the kings of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites."
Joshua,9,2,They brought their armies together to fight against Joshua and Israel.
Joshua,9,3,The people of Gibeon heard about what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai.
Joshua,9,4,So they decided to trick the Israelites. They packed supplies as if they were going on a long trip. They loaded their donkeys with old sacks and old wineskins. The wineskins were cracked but had been mended.
Joshua,9,5,They put worn-out sandals on their feet. The sandals had been patched. They also wore old clothes. All the bread they took along was dry and moldy.
Joshua,9,6,"They went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal. They spoke to him and the Israelites. They said, “We’ve come from a country that’s far away. Make a peace treaty with us.”"
Joshua,9,7,"The Israelites said to the Hivites, “But suppose you live close to us. If you do, we can’t make a peace treaty with you.”"
Joshua,9,8,"“We’ll serve you,” they said to Joshua. But Joshua asked, “Who are you? Where do you come from?”"
Joshua,9,9,"They answered, “We’ve come from a country that’s very far away. We’ve come because the Lord your God is famous. We’ve heard reports about him. We’ve heard about everything he did in Egypt."
Joshua,9,10,We’ve heard about everything he did to Sihon and Og. They were the two kings of the Amorites. They ruled east of the Jordan River. Sihon was the king of Heshbon. Og was the king of Bashan. He ruled in Ashtaroth.
Joshua,9,11,"Our elders and all the people living in our country spoke to us. They said, ‘Take supplies for your trip. Go and meet the Israelites. Say to them, “We’ll serve you. Make a peace treaty with us.” ’"
Joshua,9,12,Look at our bread. It was warm when we packed it. We packed it at home the day we left to come and see you. But look at how dry and moldy it is now.
Joshua,9,13,"When we filled these wineskins, they were new. But look at how cracked they are now. And our clothes and sandals are worn out because we’ve traveled so far.”"
Joshua,9,14,The Israelites looked over the supplies those people had brought. But they didn’t ask the Lord what they should do.
Joshua,9,15,Joshua made a peace treaty with the people who had come. He agreed to let them live. The leaders of the community gave their word that they agreed with the treaty.
Joshua,9,16,So the Israelites made a peace treaty with the people of Gibeon. But three days later they heard that the people of Gibeon lived close to them.
Joshua,9,17,"So the Israelites started out to go to the cities of those people. On the third day they came to Gibeon, Kephirah, Beeroth and Kiriath Jearim."
Joshua,9,18,"But they didn’t attack those cities. That’s because the leaders of the community had given their word and made a peace treaty with them. They had given their word in the name of the Lord , the God of Israel. The whole community told the leaders they weren’t happy with them."
Joshua,9,19,"But all the leaders answered, “We’ve made a peace treaty with them. We’ve given our word in the name of the Lord , the God of Israel. So we can’t touch them now."
Joshua,9,20,But here is what we’ll do to them. We’ll let them live. Then the Lord won’t be angry with us because we didn’t keep our promise.”
Joshua,9,21,"They continued, “Let them live. But make them cut wood and carry water to serve the whole community.” So the leaders kept their promise to them."
Joshua,9,22,"Joshua sent for the people of Gibeon. He said to them, “Why did you trick us? You said, ‘We live far away from you.’ But in fact you live close to us."
Joshua,9,23,So now you are under a curse. You will always serve us. You will always cut wood and carry water for the house of my God.”
Joshua,9,24,"They answered Joshua, “We were clearly told what the Lord your God had commanded his servant Moses to do. He commanded him to give you the whole land. He also ordered him to wipe out all its people to make room for you. So we were afraid you would kill us. That’s why we tricked you."
Joshua,9,25,We are now under your control. Do to us what you think is good and right.”
Joshua,9,26,So Joshua saved the people of Gibeon. He didn’t let the Israelites kill them.
Joshua,9,27,That day he made them cut wood and carry water. They had to serve the community of Israel. They also had to do work connected with the altar of the Lord . The altar would be at the place the Lord would choose. And they still serve the Israelites to this day.
Joshua,10,1,Adoni-Zedek was the king of Jerusalem. He heard that Joshua had captured Ai. He found out that the city had been set apart to the Lord in a special way to be destroyed. He heard that Joshua had done to Ai and its king the same thing he had done to Jericho and its king. Adoni-Zedek heard that the people of Gibeon had made a peace treaty with Israel. He also found out that they were living among the Israelites.
Joshua,10,2,The things he heard alarmed him and his people very much. That’s because Gibeon was an important city. It was like one of the royal cities. It was larger than Ai. All its men were good soldiers.
Joshua,10,3,"So Adoni-Zedek, the king of Jerusalem, made an appeal to Hoham, the king of Hebron. He appealed to Piram, the king of Jarmuth. He appealed to Japhia, the king of Lachish. He also made an appeal to Debir, the king of Eglon."
Joshua,10,4,"“Come up and help me attack Gibeon,” he said. “Its people have made peace with Joshua and the Israelites.”"
Joshua,10,5,"Then the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish and Eglon gathered their armies together. Those five Amorite kings moved all their troops into position to fight against Gibeon. Then they attacked it."
Joshua,10,6,"Joshua was in the camp at Gilgal. The people of Gibeon sent a message to him there. They said, “Don’t desert us. We serve you. Come up to us quickly! Save us! Help us! All the Amorite kings from the central hill country have gathered their armies together to fight against us.”"
Joshua,10,7,So Joshua marched up from Gilgal with his whole army. The army included all his best fighting men.
Joshua,10,8,"The Lord said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid of them. I have handed them over to you. Not one of them will be able to fight against you and win.”"
Joshua,10,9,Joshua marched all night from Gilgal. He took the Amorite armies by surprise.
Joshua,10,10,The Lord threw them into a panic as Israel marched toward them. Then Joshua and the Israelites won a complete victory over them at Gibeon. The Israelites chased them along the road that goes up to Beth Horon. They struck them down all the way to Azekah and Makkedah.
Joshua,10,11,The Amorites tried to escape as Israel marched toward them. They ran down the road from Beth Horon to Azekah. Then the Lord threw large hailstones down on them. The hailstones killed more of them than the swords of the Israelites did.
Joshua,10,12,"So the Lord gave the Amorites over to Israel. On that day Joshua spoke to the Lord while the Israelites were listening. He said, “Sun, stand still over Gibeon. And you, moon, stand still over the Valley of Aijalon.”"
Joshua,10,13,So the sun stood still. The moon stopped. They didn’t move again until the nation won the battle over its enemies. You can read about it in the Book of Jashar. The sun stopped in the middle of the sky. It didn’t go down for about a full day.
Joshua,10,14,There has never been a day like it before or since. It was a day when the Lord listened to a mere human being. Surely the Lord was fighting for Israel!
Joshua,10,15,Joshua and his whole army returned to the camp at Gilgal.
Joshua,10,16,The five Amorite kings had run away. They had hidden in the cave at Makkedah.
Joshua,10,17,Joshua was told that the five kings had been found. He was also told that they were hiding in the cave at Makkedah.
Joshua,10,18,"He said, “Roll some large rocks up to the opening of the cave. Put some men there to guard it."
Joshua,10,19,But keep on going! Chase your enemies! Attack them from behind. Don’t let them get back to their cities. The Lord your God has handed them over to you.”
Joshua,10,20,So Joshua and the men of Israel had complete victory over them. They killed almost every one of them. But a few escaped. They went back to their cities that had high walls around them.
Joshua,10,21,Then Israel’s whole army returned safely to Joshua. He was in the camp at Makkedah. No one in the land dared to say anything against the Israelites.
Joshua,10,22,"Joshua said, “Open up the cave. Bring those five kings out to me.”"
Joshua,10,23,"So Joshua’s men brought the kings out of the cave. They were the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish and Eglon."
Joshua,10,24,"The men brought them to Joshua. Then he sent for all the men of Israel. He spoke to the army commanders who had come with him. He said, “Come here. Put your feet on the necks of these kings.” So they came forward and placed their feet on the necks of the kings."
Joshua,10,25,"Joshua said to them, “Don’t be afraid. Don’t lose hope. Be strong and brave. This is what the Lord will do to all the enemies you are going to fight.”"
Joshua,10,26,Joshua put the five kings to death. He stuck a pole through each of their bodies. Then he set the poles up where people could see the bodies. He left them there until evening.
Joshua,10,27,At sunset Joshua ordered his men to take down the bodies. So they took them down from the poles and threw them into the cave where the kings had been hiding. They placed large rocks at the opening of the cave. And the rocks are still there to this day.
Joshua,10,28,That day Joshua captured Makkedah. He cut down its people and their king. He totally destroyed everyone in it. He didn’t leave anyone alive. He did to the king of Makkedah the same thing he had done to the king of Jericho.
Joshua,10,29,Joshua moved on from Makkedah to Libnah. Israel’s whole army went with him. They attacked Libnah.
Joshua,10,30,The Lord also handed that city and its king over to Israel. Joshua destroyed the city. He and his men killed everyone in it with their swords. He didn’t leave anyone alive there. He did to its king the same thing he had done to the king of Jericho.
Joshua,10,31,Joshua moved on from Libnah to Lachish. Israel’s whole army went with him. The men took up their battle positions. Then Joshua attacked Lachish.
Joshua,10,32,The Lord handed it over to Israel. Joshua captured the city on the second day of the battle. He destroyed the city. He and his men killed everyone in it with their swords. He had done the same thing to Libnah.
Joshua,10,33,"While all that was happening, Horam had come up to help Lachish. He was the king of Gezer. But Joshua won the battle over him and his army. No one was left alive."
Joshua,10,34,Joshua moved on from Lachish to Eglon. Israel’s whole army went with him. They took up their battle positions. Then they attacked Eglon.
Joshua,10,35,They captured it that same day. They totally destroyed everyone in it with their swords. They had done the same thing to Lachish.
Joshua,10,36,Joshua went up from Eglon to Hebron. Israel’s whole army went with him. Then they attacked Hebron.
Joshua,10,37,They captured the city. They destroyed it and its villages. They killed all its people and their king with their swords. They didn’t leave anyone alive. They totally destroyed the city and everyone in it. They had done the same thing at Eglon.
Joshua,10,38,Joshua turned back and attacked Debir. Israel’s whole army went with him.
Joshua,10,39,"They captured the city, its king and its villages. They totally destroyed everyone in Debir with their swords. They didn’t leave anyone alive. They did to Debir and its king the same thing they had done to Libnah and its king. They had also done the same thing to Hebron."
Joshua,10,40,"So Joshua brought the whole area under his control. That included the central hill country and the Negev Desert. It included the western hills and the mountain slopes. It also included all the kings in that whole area. Joshua didn’t leave anyone alive. He totally destroyed everyone who breathed. He did just as the Lord , the God of Israel, had commanded."
Joshua,10,41,Joshua brought everyone from Kadesh Barnea to Gaza under his control. He did the same thing to everyone from the whole area of Goshen to Gibeon.
Joshua,10,42,"He won the battle over all those kings and their lands. He did it in one campaign. That’s because the Lord , the God of Israel, fought for Israel."
Joshua,10,43,Then Joshua returned to the camp at Gilgal. Israel’s whole army went with him.
Joshua,11,1,Jabin was the king of Hazor. He heard about the battles Israel had won. So he sent a message to Jobab. Jobab was the king of Madon. Jabin sent the same message to the kings of Shimron and Akshaph.
Joshua,11,2,He also sent it to many other kings. Some ruled in the mountains in the north. Some ruled in the Arabah Valley south of Kinnereth. Others ruled in the western hills. Still others ruled in Naphoth Dor in the west.
Joshua,11,3,"Jabin sent the same message to the people of east Canaan and west Canaan. He sent it to the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites and Jebusites. They lived in the central hill country. He also sent it to the Hivites who lived below Mount Hermon in the area of Mizpah."
Joshua,11,4,Those kings marched out with all their troops. They had a large number of horses and chariots. It was a huge army. The fighting men were as many as the grains of sand on the seashore.
Joshua,11,5,All those kings gathered their armies together to fight against Israel. They set up camp together at the Waters of Merom.
Joshua,11,6,"The Lord said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid of them. By this time tomorrow I will hand all of them over to Israel. All of them will be killed. You must cut the legs of their horses. You must burn their chariots.”"
Joshua,11,7,So Joshua and his whole army attacked them suddenly. They fought against them at the Waters of Merom.
Joshua,11,8,The Lord handed them over to Israel. The Israelites won the battle over them. They hunted them down all the way to Greater Sidon. They chased them to Misrephoth Maim. They chased them to the Valley of Mizpah in the east. Not one of them was left alive.
Joshua,11,9,Joshua did to them what the Lord had ordered him to do. He cut the legs of their horses. He burned up their chariots.
Joshua,11,10,At that time Joshua turned back. He captured Hazor. He killed its king with his sword. Hazor was the most important city in all those kingdoms.
Joshua,11,11,The army of Israel killed everyone in Hazor with their swords. Its people had been set apart to the Lord to be destroyed. Israel’s army didn’t spare anyone who breathed. Then Joshua burned down the city.
Joshua,11,12,"Joshua captured all those royal cities and their kings. He and his men killed everyone in those cities with their swords. He totally destroyed them. He did just as Moses, the servant of the Lord , had commanded."
Joshua,11,13,Many cities were built on top of earlier cities that had been destroyed. Israel didn’t burn any of those except Hazor. Joshua burned it down.
Joshua,11,14,The army of Israel kept for themselves the livestock and everything else they took from those cities. But they killed all the people with their swords. They completely destroyed them. They didn’t spare anyone who breathed.
Joshua,11,15,The Lord had commanded his servant Moses to do all these things. Moses had passed that command on to Joshua. And Joshua carried it out. He did everything the Lord had commanded Moses.
Joshua,11,16,So Joshua captured the whole land. He took over the central hill country and the whole Negev Desert. He took over the whole area of Goshen. He took over the western hills. He took over the Arabah Valley. He took over the mountains of Israel and the hills around them.
Joshua,11,17,"He took over the area that begins at Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir. The area ends at Baal Gad in the Valley of Lebanon below Mount Hermon. Joshua captured the kings who ruled over that whole land. He put them to death."
Joshua,11,18,He fought battles against all those kings for a long time.
Joshua,11,19,Only the Hivites who lived in Gibeon made a peace treaty with the Israelites. No other city made a treaty with them. So Israel captured all those cities in battle.
Joshua,11,20,The Lord himself made their people stubborn. He made them go to war against Israel so he could totally destroy them. He wanted to wipe them out. He didn’t show them any mercy. The Lord had commanded Moses to destroy the Canaanites.
Joshua,11,21,"At that time Joshua went and destroyed the Anakites. They lived all through the hill country of Judah and Israel. They lived in Hebron, Debir and Anab. Joshua totally destroyed the Anakites and their towns."
Joshua,11,22,"There weren’t any Anakites left alive in Israel’s territory. But a few were left alive in Gaza, Gath and Ashdod."
Joshua,11,23,"So Joshua captured the whole land, just as the Lord had directed Moses. Joshua gave the land to Israel as their very own. He divided it up and gave each tribe its share. Then the land had peace and rest."
Joshua,12,1,The Israelites took over the territory east of the Jordan River. The land they captured reached from the Arnon River valley to Mount Hermon. It included the whole east side of the Arabah Valley. Israel won the battle over the kings of that whole territory. Here are the lands Israel captured from the kings they won the battle over.
Joshua,12,2,They took over the land of Sihon. He was the king of the Amorites. He ruled in Heshbon. The land he ruled over begins at Aroer. Aroer is on the rim of the Arnon River valley. Sihon ruled from the middle of the valley to the Jabbok River. The Jabbok is the border of Ammon. Sihon’s territory included half of Gilead.
Joshua,12,3,"He also ruled over the east side of the Arabah Valley. That land begins at the Sea of Galilee. It goes to the Dead Sea and over to Beth Jeshimoth. Then it goes south, below the slopes of Pisgah."
Joshua,12,4,Israel also took over the territory of Og. He was the king of Bashan. He was one of the last of the Rephaites. He ruled in Ashtaroth and Edrei.
Joshua,12,5,"He ruled over Mount Hermon, Salekah and the whole land of Bashan. Og’s kingdom reached all the way to the border of Geshur and Maakah. He ruled over half of Gilead. His land reached the border of Sihon, the king of Heshbon."
Joshua,12,6,Moses was the servant of the Lord . Moses and the Israelites won the battle over those two kings. He gave their land to the tribes of Reuben and Gad and half of the tribe of Manasseh. He gave it to them as their share.
Joshua,12,7,"Joshua and the Israelites won the battle over the kings who ruled west of the Jordan River. The lands of those kings reached from Baal Gad in the Valley of Lebanon to Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir. Joshua gave their lands to the tribes of Israel as their very own. He divided them up and gave each tribe its share."
Joshua,12,8,"Those lands included the central hill country, the western hills and the Arabah Valley. They also included the mountain slopes, the Desert of Judah and the Negev Desert. Those lands belonged to the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites. Here are the kings Israel won the battle over."

Joshua,13,1,"Joshua was now very old. The Lord said to him, “You are very old. And there are still very large areas of land that have not yet been taken over."
Joshua,13,2,“Here is the land that remains to be taken over. “It includes all the areas of Philistia and Geshur.
Joshua,13,3,"Those areas begin at the Shihor River in the eastern part of Egypt. They go to the territory of Ekron in the north. All that land is considered Canaanite even though it is controlled by five Philistine rulers. They rule over Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath and Ekron. The Avvites"
Joshua,13,4,live south of them. The rest of the land of Canaan that remains to be taken over reaches from Arah all the way to Aphek. Arah belongs to the people of Sidon. The land that remains to be taken reaches the border of Amorite territory.
Joshua,13,5,It includes the area of Byblos. It also includes all of Lebanon to the east. It reaches from Baal Gad below Mount Hermon all the way to Lebo Hamath.
Joshua,13,6,"“I myself will drive out all the people who live in the mountain areas. Those areas reach from Lebanon to Misrephoth Maim. They include the area where all the people of Sidon live. I myself will drive out those people to make room for the Israelites. Make sure you set that land apart for Israel. Give it to them as their share, just as I have directed you."
Joshua,13,7,Divide it up among the nine tribes and half of the tribe of Manasseh. Give each tribe its share.”
Joshua,13,8,"The other half of Manasseh’s tribe had already received the share of land Moses had given them. Their share was east of the Jordan River. The tribes of Reuben and Gad had already received their share too. Moses, the servant of the Lord , had given it to them."
Joshua,13,9,That land starts at Aroer on the rim of the Arnon River valley. It includes the town in the middle of the valley. It includes the high plains of Medeba all the way to Dibon.
Joshua,13,10,"It also includes all the towns of Sihon, the king of the Amorites. He had ruled in Heshbon. That area reaches to the border of Ammon."
Joshua,13,11,It also includes Gilead. It includes the territory of Geshur and Maakah. It includes Mount Hermon and the whole land of Bashan all the way to Salekah.
Joshua,13,12,So it includes the entire kingdom of Og in Bashan. Og had ruled in Ashtaroth and Edrei. He was the last of the Rephaites. Moses had won the battle over Sihon and Og. He had taken over their land.
Joshua,13,13,But the Israelites didn’t drive out the people of Geshur and Maakah. So they continue to live among the Israelites to this day.
Joshua,13,14,"Moses hadn’t given any share of the land to the tribe of Levi. That’s because the food offerings are their share. Those offerings are presented to the Lord , the God of Israel. Moses gave the Levites what he had promised them."
Joshua,13,15,"Here is what Moses had given to the tribe of Reuben, according to its family groups."
Joshua,13,16,Their territory starts at Aroer on the rim of the Arnon River valley. It includes the town in the middle of the valley. It includes all of the high plains near Medeba.
Joshua,13,17,"It includes Heshbon and all its towns on those plains. Those towns include Dibon, Bamoth Baal, Beth Baal Meon,"
Joshua,13,18,"Jahaz, Kedemoth and Mephaath."
Joshua,13,19,"They include Kiriathaim, Sibmah and Zereth Shahar on the hill in the valley."
Joshua,13,20,"They also include Beth Peor, Beth Jeshimoth and the slopes of Pisgah."
Joshua,13,21,"All those towns are on the high plains. The territory includes the whole kingdom of Sihon, the king of the Amorites. He had ruled in Heshbon. Moses had won the battle over him and over the chiefs of Midian. Those chiefs were Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur and Reba. They were princes who helped Sihon fight against Israel. They lived in that country."
Joshua,13,22,The Israelites killed many of them in battle. They also killed Balaam with their swords. He was the son of Beor. Balaam had used evil magic to find out what was going to happen.
Joshua,13,23,The border of the tribe of Reuben was the bank of the Jordan River. All those towns and their villages were given to the tribe of Reuben as their very own. Each family group received its share.
Joshua,13,24,"Here is what Moses had given to the tribe of Gad, according to its family groups."
Joshua,13,25,"Their territory includes Jazer and all the towns of Gilead. It includes half of the country of Ammon all the way to Aroer, which was near Rabbah."
Joshua,13,26,Their territory reaches from Heshbon to Ramath Mizpah and Betonim. It reaches from Mahanaim to the territory of Debir.
Joshua,13,27,"In the valley their land includes Beth Haram, Beth Nimrah, Sukkoth and Zaphon. It also includes the rest of the kingdom of Sihon. He was the king of Heshbon. His kingdom included the east side of the Jordan River. It reached up to the south end of the Sea of Galilee."
Joshua,13,28,All those towns and their villages were given to the tribe of Gad as their very own. Each family group received its share.
Joshua,13,29,"Here is what Moses had given to half of the tribe of Manasseh, according to its family groups. It’s what Moses had given to half of Manasseh’s family line."
Joshua,13,30,"Their territory starts at Mahanaim. It includes the whole land of Bashan. That was the entire kingdom of Og, the king of Bashan. Manasseh’s territory includes all the 60 towns of Jair in Bashan."
Joshua,13,31,It includes half of the land of Gilead. It also includes Ashtaroth and Edrei. They were the royal cities of Og in Bashan. That land was given to half of the family line of Makir. He was the son of Manasseh. Each family group received its share.
Joshua,13,32,Those were the shares of land Moses had given the eastern tribes when he was in the plains of Moab. The plains are across the Jordan River east of Jericho.
Joshua,13,33,"But Moses hadn’t given any share to the tribe of Levi. The Lord , the God of Israel, is their share. Moses gave the Levites what he had promised them."
Joshua,14,1,"The rest of the tribes of Israel received their shares of land in Canaan. Eleazar the priest and Joshua, the son of Nun, decided what each of the tribes should receive. The leaders of the tribes helped them make these decisions."
Joshua,14,2,The shares of nine tribes and half of the tribe of Manasseh were decided by casting lots. That’s what the Lord had commanded through Moses.
Joshua,14,3,Moses had given two tribes and the other half of the tribe of Manasseh their shares east of the Jordan River. But Moses had not given the Levites a share among the other tribes.
Joshua,14,4,Manasseh and Ephraim were the sons of Joseph. They had become two tribes. The Levites didn’t receive any share of the land. They only received towns to live in and grasslands for their flocks and herds.
Joshua,14,5,"So the Israelites divided up the land, just as the Lord had commanded Moses."
Joshua,14,6,"The people of Judah approached Joshua at Gilgal. Caleb, the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, spoke to Joshua. He said, “You know what the Lord said to Moses, the man of God. He spoke to him at Kadesh Barnea about you and me."
Joshua,14,7,"Moses, the servant of the Lord , sent me from Kadesh Barnea to check out the land. I was 40 years old at that time. I brought back an honest report to him. I told him exactly what I had seen."
Joshua,14,8,Several other men of Israel went up with me. What they reported terrified the people. But I followed the Lord my God with my whole heart.
Joshua,14,9,"So on that day Moses made a promise to me. He said, ‘The land you have walked on will be your share. It will be the share of your children forever. That’s because you have followed the Lord my God with your whole heart.’( Deuteronomy 1:36)"
Joshua,14,10,"“The Lord has done just as he promised. He made the promise while Israel was wandering around in the desert. That was 45 years ago. He has kept me alive all this time. So here I am today, 85 years old!"
Joshua,14,11,I’m still as strong today as I was the day Moses sent me out. I’m just as able to go out to battle now as I was then.
Joshua,14,12,"So give me this hill country. The Lord promised it to me that day. At that time you yourself heard that the Anakites were living there. You also heard that their cities were large and had high walls around them. But I’ll drive them out, just as the Lord said I would. He will help me do it.”"
Joshua,14,13,"Then Joshua blessed Caleb, the son of Jephunneh. He gave him Hebron as his share."
Joshua,14,14,"So ever since that time Hebron has belonged to Caleb, the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite. That’s because he followed the Lord , the God of Israel, with his whole heart."
Joshua,14,15,Hebron used to be called Kiriath Arba. It was named after Arba. He was the greatest man among the Anakites. So the land had peace and rest.
Joshua,15,1,"Land was given to the tribe of Judah, according to its family groups. It reached down to the territory of Edom. It went as far south as the Desert of Zin."
Joshua,15,2,Judah’s border on the south started from the bay at the south end of the Dead Sea.
Joshua,15,3,It went across to the south of Scorpion Pass. It continued on to Zin. It went over to the south of Kadesh Barnea. Then it ran past Hezron up to Addar. It curved around to Karka.
Joshua,15,4,It then went along to Azmon. There it joined the Wadi of Egypt and ended at the Mediterranean Sea. That was the southern border of Judah.
Joshua,15,5,The border on the east was the Dead Sea. It went north all the way to where the Jordan River enters the sea. The border on the north started at the bay of the Dead Sea. That’s where the Jordan River enters the sea.
Joshua,15,6,"From there it went up to Beth Hoglah. It continued north of Beth Arabah to the Stone of Bohan, the son of Reuben."
Joshua,15,7,Then it went from the Valley of Achor up to Debir. It turned north to Gilgal. Gilgal faces the Pass of Adummim south of the valley. The border continued along to the springs of En Shemesh. It came to an end at En Rogel.
Joshua,15,8,Then it ran up the Valley of Ben Hinnom. It went along the south slope of Jerusalem. From there it climbed to the top of the hill west of the Hinnom Valley. The hill is also at the north end of the Valley of Rephaim.
Joshua,15,9,From the top of the hill the border headed toward the springs of Nephtoah. It went to the towns near Mount Ephron. It went down toward Kiriath Jearim.
Joshua,15,10,Then it curved west from Kiriath Jearim to Mount Seir. It ran along the north slope of Mount Kesalon. It continued down to Beth Shemesh and crossed over to Timnah.
Joshua,15,11,It went to the north slope of Ekron. Then it turned toward Shikkeron. It passed along to Mount Baalah and reached Jabneel. The border came to an end at the Mediterranean Sea.
Joshua,15,12,The border on the west was the coastline of the Mediterranean Sea. Those were the borders of the family groups of the tribe of Judah.
Joshua,15,13,"Joshua gave a part of Judah’s share of land to Caleb, the son of Jephunneh. That was according to the Lord ’s command to Joshua. The share Caleb received was the city of Hebron. It was also called Kiriath Arba. Anak came from the family line of Arba."
Joshua,15,14,"Caleb drove three Anakites out of Hebron. Their names were Sheshai, Ahiman and Talmai. They were from the family line of Anak."
Joshua,15,15,"From Hebron, Caleb marched out against the people living in Debir. It used to be called Kiriath Sepher."
Joshua,15,16,"Caleb said, “I will give my daughter Aksah to be married. She’ll be the wife of the man who attacks and captures Kiriath Sepher.”"
Joshua,15,17,Othniel captured it. So Caleb gave his daughter Aksah to him to be his wife. Othniel was the son of Kenaz. He was Caleb’s brother.
Joshua,15,18,"One day Aksah came to Othniel. She begged him to ask her father for a field. When she got off her donkey, Caleb spoke to her. He asked, “What can I do for you?”"
Joshua,15,19,"She replied, “Do me a special favor. You have given me some land in the Negev Desert. Give me springs of water also.” So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs."
Joshua,15,20,"Here is the share of land given to the tribe of Judah, according to its family groups."

Joshua,16,1,The land given to the two tribes in the family line of Joseph began at the Jordan River. Their border started east of the springs of Jericho. It went up from there through the desert into the hill country of Bethel.
Joshua,16,2,Bethel is also called Luz. From Bethel the border crossed over to Ataroth. That’s where the Arkites live.
Joshua,16,3,Then it went west down to the territory of the Japhletites. It went all the way to the area of Lower Beth Horon. It went on to Gezer. The border came to an end at the Mediterranean Sea.
Joshua,16,4,The tribes of Manasseh and Ephraim were from the family line of Joseph. So they received that land as their share.
Joshua,16,5,"Here is the territory given to the tribe of Ephraim, according to its family groups. The border of their share of land started at Ataroth Addar in the east. It went to Upper Beth Horon."
Joshua,16,6,"It continued toward the Mediterranean Sea. From Mikmethath on the north, it curved toward the east. It went to Taanath Shiloh. It passed by Taanath Shiloh to Janoah on the east."
Joshua,16,7,Then it went down from Janoah to Ataroth and Naarah. It touched Jericho and came to an end at the Jordan River.
Joshua,16,8,From Tappuah the border went west to the Kanah Valley. It came to an end at the Mediterranean Sea. That was the land given to the tribe of Ephraim. Each family group received its share.
Joshua,16,9,The tribe of Ephraim was also given other towns and villages that were set apart for them. Those towns and villages were in the share of land given to the tribe of Manasseh.
Joshua,16,10,The people of Ephraim didn’t drive out the Canaanites living in Gezer. The Canaanites live among the people of Ephraim to this day. But they are forced to work hard for the people of Ephraim.
Joshua,17,1,Land was given to the tribe of Manasseh. It was given to Makir. Manasseh was Joseph’s oldest son. Makir was Manasseh’s oldest son. The people of Gilead came from the family line of Makir. The people of Gilead had received the lands of Gilead and Bashan. That’s because the people of Makir were great soldiers.
Joshua,17,2,"So land was given to the rest of the people of Manasseh. It was given to the family groups of Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher and Shemida. They were the other men in the family line of Manasseh, the son of Joseph. Those were their names by their family groups."
Joshua,17,3,"Makir was the son of Manasseh. Gilead was the son of Makir. Hepher was the son of Gilead. And Zelophehad was the son of Hepher. Zelophehad didn’t have any sons. He only had daughters. Their names were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milkah and Tirzah."
Joshua,17,4,"The daughters of Zelophehad went to Eleazar the priest and to Joshua, the son of Nun. They also went to the other leaders. They said, “The Lord commanded Moses to give us our share of land among our male relatives.” So Joshua gave them land along with their male relatives. That was according to what the Lord had commanded."
Joshua,17,5,Manasseh’s share was made up of ten pieces of land. That land was in addition to Gilead and Bashan east of the Jordan River.
Joshua,17,6,"So the five granddaughters of Hepher in the family line of Manasseh received land, just as the other five sons of Manasseh did. The land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the family line of Manasseh."
Joshua,17,7,The territory of Manasseh reached from Asher to Mikmethath. Mikmethath was east of Shechem. The border ran south from Mikmethath. The people living at En Tappuah were inside the border.
Joshua,17,8,Manasseh had the land around Tappuah. But the town of Tappuah itself was on the border of Manasseh’s land. It belonged to the people of Ephraim.
Joshua,17,9,The border continued south to the Kanah Valley. Some of the towns that belonged to Ephraim were located among the towns of Manasseh. But the border of Manasseh was the north side of the valley. The border came to an end at the Mediterranean Sea.
Joshua,17,10,The land on the south belonged to Ephraim. The land on the north belonged to Manasseh. The territory of Manasseh reached the Mediterranean Sea. The tribe of Asher was the border on the north. The tribe of Issachar was the border on the east.
Joshua,17,11,"Inside the land given to Issachar and Asher, the towns of Beth Shan and Ibleam belonged to Manasseh. The towns of Dor, Endor, Taanach and Megiddo and their people also belonged to Manasseh. Manasseh was given all those towns and the settlements around them. The third town in the list was also called Naphoth Dor."
Joshua,17,12,But the people of Manasseh weren’t able to take over those towns. That’s because the Canaanites had made up their minds to live in that area.
Joshua,17,13,The Israelites grew stronger. Then they forced the Canaanites to work hard for them. But they didn’t drive them out completely.
Joshua,17,14,"The people in the family line of Joseph spoke to Joshua. They said, “Why have you given us only one share of the land to have as our own? There are large numbers of us. The Lord has blessed us greatly.”"
Joshua,17,15,"“That’s true,” Joshua said. “There are large numbers of you. And the hill country of Ephraim is too small for you. So go up into the forest. Clear out some land for yourselves in the territory of the Perizzites and Rephaites.”"
Joshua,17,16,"The people in Joseph’s family line replied, “The hill country isn’t big enough for us. And all the Canaanites who live in the plains use chariots that have iron parts. They include the people of Beth Shan and its settlements. They also include the people who live in the Valley of Jezreel.”"
Joshua,17,17,"Joshua spoke again to the people in Joseph’s family line. He said to the people of Ephraim and Manasseh, “There are large numbers of you. And you are very powerful. You will have more than one piece of land."
Joshua,17,18,You will also have the central hill country. It’s covered with trees. Cut them down and clear the land. That whole land from one end to the other will belong to you. The Canaanites use chariots that have iron parts. And those people are strong. But you can drive them out.”
Joshua,18,1,The whole community of Israel gathered together at Shiloh. They set up the tent of meeting there. The country was brought under their control.
Joshua,18,2,But there were still seven tribes in Israel who had not yet received their shares of land.
Joshua,18,3,"So Joshua spoke to the Israelites. He said, “The Lord , the God of your people, has given you this land. How long will you wait before you begin to take it over?"
Joshua,18,4,Appoint three men from each tribe. I’ll send them to map out the land. Then they’ll write a report about its features. The report will point out the share of land each tribe will receive. Then the men will return to me.
Joshua,18,5,You must divide the land up into seven shares. Judah must remain in its territory in the south. The people in Joseph’s family line must remain in their territory in the north.
Joshua,18,6,Write reports about the features of those seven shares of land. Bring them here to me. Then I’ll cast lots for you in the sight of the Lord our God.
Joshua,18,7,"But the Levites don’t get any share of your land. That’s because their share is to serve the Lord as priests. The tribes of Gad and Reuben and half of the tribe of Manasseh have already received their shares. They are on the east side of the Jordan River. Moses, the servant of the Lord , gave their shares to them.”"
Joshua,18,8,"The men started out on their way to map out the land. Joshua directed them, “Go and map out the land. Write a report about its features. Then return to me. I’ll cast lots for you here at Shiloh in the sight of the Lord .”"
Joshua,18,9,So the men left and went through the land. They wrote a report about its features on a scroll. It showed how they divided up the land into seven shares. It listed the towns in each share. The men returned to Joshua in the camp at Shiloh.
Joshua,18,10,Then Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh in the sight of the Lord . There he gave out a share of land to each of the remaining tribes in Israel.
Joshua,18,11,"The first lot drawn out was for the tribe of Benjamin, according to its family groups. The territory they were given was located between the tribes of the people of Judah and the people of Joseph. Here are the borders of Benjamin’s territory."
Joshua,18,12,On the north side their border started at the Jordan River. It went past the north slope of Jericho. Then it headed west into the central hill country. It came to an end at the Desert of Beth Aven.
Joshua,18,13,From there the border crossed to the south slope of Bethel. Then it went down to Ataroth Addar on the hill south of Lower Beth Horon.
Joshua,18,14,From the hill that faces Beth Horon on the south the border turned south. Then the border went along the west side of the hill. It came to an end at Kiriath Jearim. That town belongs to the people of Judah. That was the border on the west.
Joshua,18,15,The border on the south side started at the west edge of Kiriath Jearim. It came to an end at the springs of Nephtoah.
Joshua,18,16,"It went down to the foot of the hill that faces the Valley of Ben Hinnom. The hill is north of the Valley of Rephaim. The border continued down the Hinnom Valley. It went along the south slope of Jerusalem, where the people of Jebus live. It continued on to En Rogel."
Joshua,18,17,"Then it curved north. It went to En Shemesh. It continued on to Geliloth. Geliloth faces the Pass of Adummim. The border ran down to the Stone of Bohan, the son of Reuben."
Joshua,18,18,It continued to the north slope of Beth Arabah. It went on down into the Arabah Valley.
Joshua,18,19,From there it went to the north slope of Beth Hoglah. It came to an end at the north bay of the Dead Sea. That’s where the Jordan River flows into the Dead Sea. That was the border on the south.
Joshua,18,20,The Jordan River formed the border on the east side. Those were the borders that marked out on all sides the land the family groups of Benjamin received as their share.
Joshua,18,21,"Here is a list of towns given to the tribe of Benjamin, according to its family groups. Jericho, Beth Hoglah, Emek Keziz,"

Joshua,19,9,Simeon’s share of land was taken from Judah’s share. That’s because Judah had more land than they needed. So the people of Simeon received their share of land inside the territory of Judah.
Joshua,19,10,"The third lot drawn out was for the tribe of Zebulun, according to its family groups. Here are the borders of Zebulun’s territory. The border of their share of land went as far as Sarid."

Joshua,19,47,The people of Dan lost their territory. So they went up and attacked Leshem. They captured it. They killed its people with their swords. Then they moved into Leshem and made their homes there. They named it Dan. That’s because they traced their family line back to him.
Joshua,19,48,"All those towns and their villages were the share the tribe of Dan received, according to its family groups."
Joshua,19,49,"The Israelites finished dividing up the shares of land the tribes received. Then they gave a share to Joshua, the son of Nun."
Joshua,19,50,They did what the Lord had commanded them to do. They gave Joshua the town he asked for. It was Timnath Serah in the hill country of Ephraim. He built up the town and made his home there.
Joshua,19,51,"All those territories were given out by casting lots at Shiloh. The lots were drawn out by Eleazar the priest and by Joshua, the son of Nun. The leaders of the tribes of Israel helped them. The lots were drawn out in front of the Lord at the entrance to the tent of meeting. So the work of dividing up the land was finished."
Joshua,20,1,"Then the Lord spoke to Joshua. He said,"
Joshua,20,2,"“Tell the Israelites to choose the cities to go to for safety, just as I directed you through Moses."
Joshua,20,3,Anyone who kills a person by accident can run there for safety. So can anyone who kills a person without meaning to. The one charged with murder will be kept safe from the nearest male relative of the person killed.
Joshua,20,4,Suppose those who are charged with murder run for safety to one of these cities. Then they must stand in the entrance of the city gate. They must state their case in front of the elders of that city. The elders must let them come into their city. The elders must provide a place for them to live in their city.
Joshua,20,5,Suppose the nearest male relative of the person killed chases the one charged with murder. Then the elders must not hand them over to that relative. That’s because that person didn’t mean to kill their neighbor. They didn’t make evil plans to do it.
Joshua,20,6,They must stay in that city until their case has been brought to the community court. They must stay there until the high priest serving at that time dies. Then they can go back to their own home. They can return to the town they ran away from.”
Joshua,20,7,So the Israelites set apart Kedesh in Galilee. It’s in the hill country of Naphtali. They set apart Shechem. It’s in the hill country of Ephraim. They set apart Kiriath Arba. It’s in the hill country of Judah. Kiriath Arba is also called Hebron.
Joshua,20,8,On the east side of the Jordan River near Jericho they chose Bezer. It’s in the desert on the high plains. It’s in the territory of the tribe of Reuben. They chose Ramoth in Gilead. It’s in the territory of the tribe of Gad. They chose Golan in the land of Bashan. It’s in the territory of the tribe of Manasseh.
Joshua,20,9,Suppose you kill someone by accident. Or another Israelite does it. Or an outsider who lives among you does it. Then any of you can run for safety to one of these cities that have been chosen. There you won’t be killed by the nearest male relative of the person killed by accident. First your case must be brought to the community court.
Joshua,21,1,"The leaders of the Levite family groups approached Eleazar the priest and Joshua, the son of Nun. They also approached the leaders of the family groups of Israel’s other tribes."
Joshua,21,2,"They went to all of them at Shiloh in Canaan. They said to them, “Give us towns to live in. Also give us grasslands for our livestock. That’s what the Lord commanded through Moses.”"
Joshua,21,3,So the Israelites gave the Levites towns and grasslands out of their own shares of land. They did what the Lord had commanded. Here are the towns the Levites were given.
Joshua,21,4,"The first lot drawn out was for the people of Kohath, according to their family groups. Some of the Levites came from the family line of Aaron the priest. They were given 13 towns from the tribes of Judah, Simeon and Benjamin."
Joshua,21,5,The rest of Kohath’s family groups were given ten towns. Those towns were from the family groups of the tribes of Ephraim and Dan and half of the tribe of Manasseh.
Joshua,21,6,"The family groups of Gershon were given 13 towns. Those towns were from the family groups of the tribes of Issachar, Asher and Naphtali and half of the tribe of Manasseh. That part of Manasseh was in the land of Bashan."
Joshua,21,7,"The family groups of Merari received 12 towns from the tribes of Reuben, Gad and Zebulun. Each family group received its share."
Joshua,21,8,So the Israelites gave those towns and their grasslands to the Levites. They did what the Lord had commanded through Moses.
Joshua,21,9,Some towns were given from the territories of the tribes of Judah and Simeon.
Joshua,21,10,The Israelites gave them to the members of the family line of Aaron. The towns were given to the family groups of Kohath. They were Levites. The first lot drawn out was for them. Here are the towns the family groups of Kohath were given.
Joshua,21,11,The Israelites gave them Kiriath Arba and the grasslands around it. Kiriath Arba is also called Hebron. It’s in the hill country of Judah. Anak came from the family line of Arba.
Joshua,21,12,But Israel had already given away the fields and villages around the city. They had given them to Caleb as his share. Caleb was the son of Jephunneh.
Joshua,21,13,"So they gave Hebron to the members of the family line of Aaron the priest. Hebron was a city where anyone charged with murder could go for safety. They also gave them Libnah,"
Joshua,21,14,"Jattir, Eshtemoa,"
Joshua,21,15,"Holon, Debir,"
Joshua,21,16,"Ain, Juttah and Beth Shemesh. They gave those towns and their grasslands to the family groups of Kohath. The total number of towns from the tribes of Judah and Simeon came to nine."
Joshua,21,17,"The Israelites gave some towns from the tribe of Benjamin to the family groups of Kohath. The towns were Gibeon, Geba,"
Joshua,21,18,Anathoth and Almon. The total number of these towns and their grasslands came to four.
Joshua,21,19,So the total number of towns and their grasslands given to the priests in Aaron’s family line came to 13.
Joshua,21,20,There were other family groups of Kohath among the Levites. They were given towns from the tribe of Ephraim. Here are the towns those other family groups of Kohath were given.
Joshua,21,21,"In the hill country of Ephraim they were given Shechem. It was a city where anyone charged with murder could go for safety. They were also given Gezer,"

Joshua,21,25,From half of the tribe of Manasseh they received Taanach and Gath Rimmon. The total number of these towns and their grasslands came to two.
Joshua,21,26,So all these ten towns and their grasslands were given to the other family groups of Kohath.
Joshua,21,27,Here are the towns given to the family groups of Gershon among the Levites. From half of the tribe of Manasseh they received Golan in the land of Bashan. Golan was a city where anyone charged with murder could go for safety. They also received Be Eshterah. The total number of these towns and their grasslands came to two.
Joshua,21,28,"From the tribe of Issachar they received Kishion, Daberath,"
Joshua,21,29,Jarmuth and En Gannim. The total number of these towns and their grasslands came to four.
Joshua,21,30,"From the tribe of Asher they received Mishal, Abdon,"
Joshua,21,31,Helkath and Rehob. The total number of these towns and their grasslands came to four.
Joshua,21,32,From the tribe of Naphtali they received Kedesh in Galilee. Kedesh was a city where anyone charged with murder could go for safety. They also received Hammoth Dor and Kartan. The total number of these towns and their grasslands came to three.
Joshua,21,33,So the total number of towns and their grasslands given to the family groups of Gershon came to 13.
Joshua,21,34,"The rest of the Levites were from the family groups of Merari. Here are the towns they were given. From the tribe of Zebulun they received Jokneam, Kartah,"
Joshua,21,35,Dimnah and Nahalal. The total number of these towns and their grasslands came to four.
Joshua,21,36,"From the tribe of Reuben they received Bezer, Jahaz,"
Joshua,21,37,Kedemoth and Mephaath. The total number of these towns and their grasslands came to four.
Joshua,21,38,"From the tribe of Gad they received Ramoth in Gilead. Ramoth was a city where anyone charged with murder could go for safety. They also received Mahanaim,"
Joshua,21,39,Heshbon and Jazer. The total number of these towns and their grasslands came to four.
Joshua,21,40,So the total number of towns given to the family groups of Merari came to 12. That concludes the list of towns the rest of the Levites received.
Joshua,21,41,The total number of Levite towns and their grasslands in the territory given to Israel came to 48.
Joshua,21,42,Each of those towns had grasslands around it. That was true of all of them.
Joshua,21,43,"So the Lord gave Israel all the land he had promised to give to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. And Israel took it over. Then they made their homes there."
Joshua,21,44,The Lord gave them peace and rest on every side. He had promised their people of long ago that he would do that. Not one of Israel’s enemies was able to fight against them and win. The Lord handed all their enemies over to them.
Joshua,21,45,The Lord kept all the good promises he had made to the Israelites. Every one of them came true.
Joshua,22,1,Joshua sent for the tribes of Reuben and Gad and half of the tribe of Manasseh.
Joshua,22,2,"He said to them, “You have done everything that Moses, the servant of the Lord , commanded. You have also obeyed everything I commanded."
Joshua,22,3,"For a long time now you haven’t deserted the other Israelites. Instead, you have done what the Lord your God sent you to do. You have obeyed him right up to this day."
Joshua,22,4,"Now the Lord your God has given the other tribes peace and rest. That’s what he promised to do. So return to your homes. They are in the land that Moses, the servant of the Lord , gave you. It’s on the east side of the Jordan River."
Joshua,22,5,"Be very careful to obey the law that Moses, the servant of the Lord , gave you. He commanded you to love the Lord your God. He told you to live exactly as the Lord wants you to. He told you to obey the Lord ’s commands. He told you to remain faithful to the Lord . And he told you to serve the Lord with all your heart and with all your soul.”"
Joshua,22,6,Joshua gave the eastern tribes his blessing. Then he sent them home. So they went.
Joshua,22,7,"Moses had given land in Bashan to half of the tribe of Manasseh. Joshua had given land to the other half of the tribe. He had given it to them along with the other tribes on the west side of the Jordan River. When Joshua sent them home, he blessed them."
Joshua,22,8,"He said, “Return to your homes. Take your great wealth with you. Return with your large herds of livestock. Take your silver, gold, bronze and iron with you. Return with all the extra clothes you acquired. Divide up the things you have taken from your enemies. Share them with your people.”"
Joshua,22,9,So the tribes of Reuben and Gad and half of the tribe of Manasseh went home. They left the other Israelites at Shiloh in Canaan. They returned to Gilead. That was their own land. They had acquired it according to the Lord ’s command through Moses.
Joshua,22,10,The tribes of Reuben and Gad and half of the tribe of Manasseh came to Geliloth. It was near the Jordan River in the land of Canaan. They built a large altar there by the Jordan.
Joshua,22,11,The rest of the Israelites heard that the eastern tribes had built the altar. They heard that it had been built on the border of Canaan at Geliloth. It was near the Jordan River on the west side.
Joshua,22,12,So the whole community of Israel gathered together at Shiloh. They decided to go to war against the eastern tribes.
Joshua,22,13,The Israelites sent Phinehas the priest to the land of Gilead. Phinehas was the son of Eleazar. They sent him to the tribes of Reuben and Gad and half of the tribe of Manasseh.
Joshua,22,14,They sent ten of their leaders with him. There was one from each of the tribes of Israel. Each man was the leader of a family group among the larger family groups of Israel.
Joshua,22,15,"Those leaders went to the tribes of Reuben and Gad and half of the tribe of Manasseh. Those tribes were in the land of Gilead. The leaders said to them,"
Joshua,22,16,“We’re speaking for the Lord ’s whole community. How could you disobey the God of Israel like this? How could you turn away from the Lord ? How could you disobey him by building an altar for yourselves?
Joshua,22,17,Don’t you remember how we sinned at Peor? The Lord struck us with a plague because of what we did. Up to this day we’re still suffering because of that sin.
Joshua,22,18,"Are you turning away from the Lord now? “Suppose you disobey the Lord today. If you do, he’ll be angry with the whole community of Israel tomorrow."
Joshua,22,19,"If your own land is ‘unclean,’ come over to the Lord ’s land. It’s where his holy tent stands. Share our land with us. But don’t disobey the Lord . Don’t turn against us by building an altar for yourselves. Don’t build any altar other than the altar of the Lord our God."
Joshua,22,20,"Remember what happened to Achan, the son of Zerah. Achan wasn’t faithful to the Lord . He took the things that had been set apart to the Lord in a special way to be destroyed. Didn’t the whole community of Israel experience the Lord ’s anger? Achan wasn’t the only one who died because of his sin.”"
Joshua,22,21,Then the tribes of Reuben and Gad and half of the tribe of Manasseh replied. They answered the leaders of the family groups of Israel.
Joshua,22,22,"They said, “The Mighty One, God, the Lord ! The Mighty One, God, the Lord ! He knows! And we want Israel to know! Have we opposed the Lord ? Have we refused to obey him? If we have, don’t spare us today."
Joshua,22,23,"Have we built our own altar so we can turn away from the Lord ? Have we built it to offer burnt offerings and grain offerings on it? Have we built it to sacrifice friendship offerings on it? If we have, may the Lord himself hold us accountable."
Joshua,22,24,"“No! We built it because we were afraid. Someday your children might speak to our children. We were afraid they might say, ‘What do you have to do with the Lord ? What do you have to do with the God of Israel?"
Joshua,22,25,"The Lord has made the Jordan River a border between us and you. You people of Reuben! You people of Gad! You don’t have anything to do with the Lord .’ If your children say that, they might cause our children to stop worshiping the Lord."
Joshua,22,26,"“That’s why we said to ourselves, ‘Let’s get ready and build an altar. But let’s not build it to offer burnt offerings or sacrifices on it.’"
Joshua,22,27,"So just the opposite is true. The altar will be a witness between us and you. It will be a witness between our children and yours after us. It will also be a witness that we will worship the Lord at his sacred tent. We’ll worship him there with our burnt offerings, sacrifices and friendship offerings. Then in days to come your children won’t be able to say to ours, ‘You don’t have anything to do with the Lord .’"
Joshua,22,28,"“So we said to ourselves, ‘Suppose they say that to us sometime. Or suppose they say it to our children after us. Then we’ll answer, “Look at this altar. It’s exactly like the Lord ’s altar. Our people built it. They didn’t build it to offer burnt offerings and sacrifices on it. Instead, they built it to be a witness between us and you.” ’"
Joshua,22,29,"“We would never refuse to obey the Lord . We would never turn away from him now. We wouldn’t build an altar to offer burnt offerings, grain offerings and sacrifices on it. We wouldn’t use any altar other than the altar of the Lord our God. That altar stands in front of his holy tent.”"
Joshua,22,30,"Phinehas the priest heard what the tribes of Reuben, Gad and Manasseh had to say. The leaders of the family groups of the community of Israel heard it too. All of them were pleased with what they heard."
Joshua,22,31,"Phinehas the priest spoke to the tribes of Reuben, Gad and Manasseh. Phinehas was the son of Eleazar. He said, “Today we know that the Lord is with us. That’s because you have been faithful to him in this matter. Now you have saved the Israelites from the Lord ’s anger against them.”"
Joshua,22,32,"Then Phinehas the priest, the son of Eleazar, returned to Canaan. So did the leaders. All of them went back from their meeting with the tribes of Reuben and Gad in Gilead. They brought a report back to the Israelites."
Joshua,22,33,The people were glad to hear the report. They praised God. They didn’t talk anymore about going to war against the eastern tribes. And they didn’t talk anymore about destroying the country where the tribes of Reuben and Gad lived.
Joshua,22,34,The tribes of Reuben and Gad gave the altar a name. They called it A Witness Between Us that the Lord is God.
Joshua,23,1,A long time had passed. The Lord had given Israel peace and rest from all their enemies around them. By that time Joshua was very old.
Joshua,23,2,"So he sent for all the elders, leaders, judges and officials of Israel. He said to them, “I’m very old."
Joshua,23,3,You yourselves have seen everything the Lord your God has done. You have seen what he’s done to all these nations because of you. The Lord your God fought for you.
Joshua,23,4,Remember how I’ve given you all the land of the nations that remain here. I’ve given each of your tribes a share of it. It’s the land of the nations I conquered. It’s between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea in the west.
Joshua,23,5,"The Lord your God himself will drive those nations out of your way. He will push them out to make room for you. You will take over their land, just as the Lord your God promised you."
Joshua,23,6,“Be very strong. Be careful to obey everything written in the Book of the Law of Moses. Don’t turn away from it to the right or the left.
Joshua,23,7,Don’t have anything to do with the nations that remain among you. Don’t use the names of their gods for any reason at all. Don’t give your word and make promises in their names. You must not serve them. You must not bow down to them.
Joshua,23,8,"You must remain true to the Lord your God, just as you have done until now."
Joshua,23,9,“The Lord has driven out great and powerful nations to make room for you. To this day no one has been able to fight against you and win.
Joshua,23,10,"One of you can chase a thousand away. That’s because the Lord your God fights for you, just as he promised he would."
Joshua,23,11,So be very careful to love the Lord your God.
Joshua,23,12,"“But suppose you turn away from him. You mix with the people who are left alive in the nations that remain among you. Later, you and they get married to each other. And you do other kinds of things with them."
Joshua,23,13,"Then you can be sure of what the Lord your God will do. He won’t drive out those nations to make room for you anymore. Instead, they will become traps and snares for you. They will be like whips on your backs. They will be like thorns in your eyes. All that will continue until you are destroyed. It will continue until you are removed from this good land. It’s the land the Lord your God has given you."
Joshua,23,14,"“Now I’m about to die, just as everyone else on earth does. The Lord your God has kept all the good promises he gave you. Every one of them has come true. Not one has failed to come true. And you know that with all your heart and soul."
Joshua,23,15,Every good thing has come to pass that the Lord your God has promised you. So you know that he can also bring against you all the evil things he has warned you about. He’ll do it until he has destroyed you. He’ll do it until he has removed you from this good land. It’s the land he has given you.
Joshua,23,16,Suppose you break the covenant the Lord your God made with you. He commanded you to obey it. But suppose you go and serve other gods. And you bow down to them. Then the Lord will be very angry with you. You will quickly be destroyed. You will be removed from the good land he has given you.”
Joshua,24,1,"Joshua gathered all Israel’s tribes together at Shechem. He sent for the elders, leaders, judges and officials of Israel. They came and stood there in the sight of God."
Joshua,24,2,"Joshua spoke to all the people. He said, “The Lord is the God of Israel. He says, ‘Long ago your people lived east of the Euphrates River. They worshiped other gods there. Your people included Terah. He was the father of Abraham and Nahor."
Joshua,24,3,I took your father Abraham from the land east of the Euphrates. I led him all through Canaan. I gave him many children and grandchildren. I gave him Isaac.
Joshua,24,4,To Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. I gave the hill country of Seir to Esau. But Jacob and his family went down to Egypt.
Joshua,24,5,“ ‘Then I sent Moses and Aaron. I made the people of Egypt suffer because of the plagues I sent on them. But I brought you out of Egypt.
Joshua,24,6,"When I brought your people out, they came to the Red Sea. The people of Egypt chased them with chariots and with men on horses. They chased them all the way to the sea."
Joshua,24,7,"But your people cried out to me for help. So I put darkness between you and the people of Egypt. I swept them into the sea. It completely covered them. Your own eyes saw what I did to them. After that, you lived in the desert for a long time."
Joshua,24,8,“ ‘I brought you to the land of the Amorites. They lived east of the Jordan River. They fought against you. But I handed them over to you. I destroyed them to make room for you. Then you took over their land.
Joshua,24,9,"Balak, the son of Zippor, prepared to fight against Israel. Balak was the king of Moab. He sent for Balaam, the son of Beor. Balak wanted Balaam to put a curse on you."
Joshua,24,10,But I would not listen to Balaam’s curses. So he blessed you again and again. And I saved you from his power.
Joshua,24,11,"“ ‘Then you went across the Jordan River. You came to Jericho. Its people fought against you. So did the Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hittites, Girgashites, Hivites and Jebusites. But I handed them over to you."
Joshua,24,12,I sent hornets ahead of you. They drove your enemies out to make room for you. That included the two Amorite kings. You did not do that with your own swords and bows.
Joshua,24,13,So I gave you a land you had never farmed. I gave you cities you had not built. You are now living in them. And you are eating the fruit of vineyards and olive trees you did not plant.’
Joshua,24,14,“So have respect for the Lord . Serve him. Be completely faithful to him. Throw away the gods your people worshiped east of the Euphrates River and in Egypt. Serve the Lord.
Joshua,24,15,"But suppose you don’t want to serve him. Then choose for yourselves right now whom you will serve. You can choose the gods your people served east of the Euphrates River. Or you can serve the gods of the Amorites. After all, you are living in their land. But as for me and my family, we will serve the Lord .”"
Joshua,24,16,"Then the people answered Joshua, “We would never desert the Lord ! We would never serve other gods!"
Joshua,24,17,"The Lord our God himself brought us and our parents up out of Egypt. He brought us out of that land where we were slaves. With our own eyes, we saw those great signs he did. He kept us safe on our entire journey. He kept us safe as we traveled through all the nations."
Joshua,24,18,He drove them out to make room for us. That included the Amorites. They also lived in the land. We too will serve the Lord . That’s because he is our God.”
Joshua,24,19,"Joshua said to the people, “You aren’t able to serve the Lord . He is a holy God. He is a jealous God. He won’t forgive you when you disobey him. He won’t forgive you when you sin against him."
Joshua,24,20,"Suppose you desert the Lord . Suppose you serve the gods that people in other lands serve. If you do, he will turn against you. He will bring trouble on you. He will destroy you, even though he has been good to you.”"
Joshua,24,21,"But the people said to Joshua, “No! We will serve the Lord .”"
Joshua,24,22,"Then Joshua said, “You are witnesses against yourselves. You have said that you have chosen to serve the Lord .” “Yes. We are witnesses,” they replied."
Joshua,24,23,"“Now then,” said Joshua, “throw away the statues of the gods that are among you. People from other lands serve those gods. Give yourselves completely to the Lord . He is the God of Israel.”"
Joshua,24,24,"Then the people said to Joshua, “We will serve the Lord our God. We will obey him.”"
Joshua,24,25,On that day Joshua made a covenant for the people. There at Shechem he reminded them of its rules and laws.
Joshua,24,26,He recorded these things in the Book of the Law of God. Then he got a large stone. He set it up in Shechem under the oak tree. It was near the place that had been set apart for the Lord.
Joshua,24,27,“Look!” he said to all the people. “This stone will be a witness against us. It has heard all the words the Lord has spoken to us. Suppose you aren’t faithful to your God. Then the stone will be a witness against you.”
Joshua,24,28,Joshua sent the people away. He sent all of them to their own shares of land.
Joshua,24,29,"Then Joshua, the servant of the Lord , died. He was the son of Nun. He was 110 years old when he died."
Joshua,24,30,His people buried him at Timnath Serah on his own property. It’s north of Mount Gaash in the hill country of Ephraim.
Joshua,24,31,Israel served the Lord as long as Joshua lived. They also served him as long as the elders lived. Those were the elders who lived longer than Joshua did. They had seen for themselves everything the Lord had done for Israel.
Joshua,24,32,The Israelites had brought Joseph’s bones up from Egypt. They buried his bones at Shechem in the piece of land Jacob had bought. He had bought it from the sons of Hamor. He had paid 100 pieces of silver for it. Hamor was the father of Shechem. That piece of land became the share that belonged to Joseph’s children after him.
Joshua,24,33,Aaron’s son Eleazar died. He was buried at Gibeah in the hill country of Ephraim. Gibeah had been given to Eleazar’s son Phinehas.
