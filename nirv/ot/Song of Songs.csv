Song of Songs,1,1,This is the greatest song Solomon ever wrote.
Song of Songs,1,2,“I long for your lips to kiss me! Your love makes me happier than wine does.
Song of Songs,1,3,The lotion you have on pleases me. Your name is like perfume that is poured out. No wonder the young women love you!
Song of Songs,1,4,"Take me away with you. Let us hurry! King Solomon, bring me into your palace.” “King Solomon, you fill us with joy. You make us happy. We praise your love more than we praise wine.” “It is right for them to love you!"
Song of Songs,1,5,"“Women of Jerusalem, my skin is dark but lovely. It is dark like the tents in Kedar. It’s like the curtains of Solomon’s tent."
Song of Songs,1,6,Don’t stare at me because I’m dark. The sun has made my skin look like this. My brothers were angry with me. They made me take care of the vineyards. I haven’t even taken care of my own vineyard.
Song of Songs,1,7,"“King Solomon, I love you. So tell me where you take care of your flock. Tell me where you rest your sheep at noon. Why should I have to act like a prostitute near the flocks of your friends?”"
Song of Songs,1,8,“You are the most beautiful woman of all. Don’t you know where to find the king? Follow the tracks the sheep make. Take care of your young goats near the tents of the shepherds.”
Song of Songs,1,9,“You are my love. You are like a mare among Pharaoh’s chariot horses.
Song of Songs,1,10,Your earrings make your cheeks even more beautiful. Your strings of jewels make your neck even more lovely.
Song of Songs,1,11,We will make gold earrings for you. We’ll decorate them with silver.”
Song of Songs,1,12,“The king was at his table. My perfume gave off a sweet smell.
Song of Songs,1,13,The one who loves me is like a small bag of myrrh resting between my breasts.
Song of Songs,1,14,He is like henna flowers from the vineyards of En Gedi.”

Song of Songs,2,3,"“My love, among the young men you are like an apple tree among the trees of the forest. I’m happy to sit in your shade. Your fruit tastes so sweet to me."
Song of Songs,2,4,Lead me to the dinner hall. Let your banner of love be lifted high above me.
Song of Songs,2,5,Give me some raisins to make me strong. Give me some apples to make me feel like new again. Our love has made me weak.
Song of Songs,2,6,Your left arm is under my head. Your right arm is around me.
Song of Songs,2,7,"Women of Jerusalem, make me a promise. Let the antelopes and the does serve as witnesses. Don’t stir up love. Don’t wake it up until it’s ready."
Song of Songs,2,8,“Listen! I hear my love! Look! Here he comes! He’s leaping across the mountains. He’s coming over the hills.
Song of Songs,2,9,The one who loves me is like an antelope or a young deer. Look! There he stands behind our wall. He’s gazing through the window. He’s peering through the screen.
Song of Songs,2,10,"He said to me, ‘Rise up, my love. Come with me, my beautiful one."
Song of Songs,2,11,Look! The winter is past. The rains are over and gone.
Song of Songs,2,12,Flowers are appearing on the earth. The season for singing has come. The cooing of doves is heard in our land.
Song of Songs,2,13,"The fig trees are producing their early fruit. The flowers on the vines are giving off their sweet smell. Rise up and come, my love. Come with me, my beautiful one.’ ”"
Song of Songs,2,14,“You are like a dove in an opening in the rocks. You are like a dove in a hiding place on a mountainside. Show me your face. Let me hear your voice. Your voice is so sweet. Your face is so lovely.
Song of Songs,2,15,Catch the foxes for us. Catch the little foxes. They destroy our vineyards. The vineyards are in bloom.”
Song of Songs,2,16,"“My love belongs to me, and I belong to him. Like an antelope, he eats among the lilies."
Song of Songs,2,17,"Until the day begins and the shadows fade away, turn to me, my love. Be like an antelope or like a young deer on the rocky hills."
Song of Songs,3,1,“All night long on my bed I searched for the one my heart loves. I looked for him but didn’t find him.
Song of Songs,3,2,I will get up and go around in the city. I’ll look through all of its streets. I’ll search for the one my heart loves. So I looked for him but didn’t find him.
Song of Songs,3,3,Those on guard duty found me as they were walking around in the city. ‘Have you seen the one my heart loves?’ I asked.
Song of Songs,3,4,As soon as I had passed by them I found the one my heart loves. I threw my arms around him and didn’t let him go until I had brought him to my mother’s house. I took him to my mother’s room.
Song of Songs,3,5,"Women of Jerusalem, make me a promise. Let the antelopes and the does serve as witnesses. Don’t stir up love. Don’t wake it up until it’s ready."
Song of Songs,3,6,“Who is this man coming up from the desert like a column of smoke? He smells like myrrh and incense made from all the spices of the trader.
Song of Songs,3,7,Look! There’s Solomon’s movable throne. Sixty soldiers accompany it. They have been chosen from the best warriors in Israel.
Song of Songs,3,8,All of them are wearing swords. They have fought many battles. Each one has his sword at his side. Each is prepared for the terrors of the night.
Song of Songs,3,9,King Solomon made the movable throne for himself. He made it out of wood from Lebanon.
Song of Songs,3,10,"He formed its posts out of silver. He made its base out of gold. Its seat was covered with purple cloth. It was decorated inside with love. Women of Jerusalem,"
Song of Songs,3,11,"come out. “Look, you women of Zion. Look at King Solomon wearing his crown. His mother placed it on him. She did it on his wedding day. His heart was full of joy.”"

Song of Songs,4,8,"“Come with me from Lebanon, my bride. Come with me from Lebanon. Come down from the top of Mount Amana. Come down from the top of Senir. Come to me from the peak of Mount Hermon. Leave the dens where the lions live. Leave the places in the mountains where the leopards stay."
Song of Songs,4,9,"My bride, you have stolen my heart with one glance of your eyes. My sister, you have stolen my heart with one jewel in your necklace."
Song of Songs,4,10,"My bride, your love is so delightful. My sister, your love makes me happier than wine does. Your perfume smells better than any spice."
Song of Songs,4,11,"Your lips are as sweet as honey, my bride. Milk and honey are under your tongue. Your clothes smell like the cedar trees in Lebanon."
Song of Songs,4,12,"My bride, you are like a garden that is locked up. My sister, you are like a spring of water that has a fence around it. You are like a fountain that is sealed up."
Song of Songs,4,13,"You are like trees whose branches are loaded with pomegranates, fine fruits, henna and nard,"

Song of Songs,5,3,“But I’ve taken off my robe. Must I put it on again? I’ve washed my feet. Must I get them dirty again?
Song of Songs,5,4,My love put his hand through the opening. My heart began to pound for him.
Song of Songs,5,5,I got up to open the door for my love. My hands dripped with myrrh. It flowed from my fingers onto the handles of the lock.
Song of Songs,5,6,"I opened the door for my love. But he had left and was gone. My heart sank because he had left. I looked for him but didn’t find him. I called out to him, but he didn’t answer."
Song of Songs,5,7,Those on guard duty found me as they were walking around in the city. They beat me. They hurt me. Those on guard duty at the walls took my coat away from me.

Song of Songs,6,13,"“Come back to us. Come back, Shulammite woman. Come back to us. Come back. Then we can look at you.” “Why do you want to look at the Shulammite woman as you would watch a dancer at Mahanaim?”"

Love is as powerful as death. Love’s jealousy is as strong as the grave. Love is like a blazing fire. Love burns like a mighty flame.
Song of Songs,8,7,No amount of water can put it out. Rivers can’t sweep it away. Suppose someone offers all their wealth to buy love. That won’t even come close to being enough.”
Song of Songs,8,8,“We have a little sister. Her breasts are still small. What should we do for our sister when she gets engaged?
Song of Songs,8,9,"If she were a wall, we’d build silver towers on her. If she were a door, we’d cover her with cedar boards.”"
