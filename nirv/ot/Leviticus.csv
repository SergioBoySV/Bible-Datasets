Leviticus,7,8,The priest who offers a burnt offering for anyone can keep its hide for himself.
Leviticus,7,9,Every grain offering baked in an oven belongs to the priest who offers it. So does every grain offering cooked in a pan or on a metal plate.

Leviticus,7,14,They must bring one of each kind of bread as an offering. One kind is made with yeast. The other is not. Both of them are a gift to the Lord . They belong to the priest who splashes the blood of the friendship offering against the altar.
Leviticus,7,15,The person must eat the meat from their thank offering on the day they offer it. They must not leave any of it until morning.
Leviticus,7,16,"“ ‘But suppose they bring a friendship offering to keep a promise they have made. Or suppose they bring an offering they choose to give. Then they must eat the sacrifice on the day they offer it. But if anything is left over, they may eat it the next day."
Leviticus,7,17,They must burn up any meat from the sacrifice left over until the third day.
Leviticus,7,18,"Suppose they eat any meat from the friendship offering on the third day. Then the Lord will not accept the offering. He will not accept it as a gift from them. It is not pure. If they eat any of it, they will be held responsible for it."
Leviticus,7,19,“ ‘They must not eat meat that touches anything “unclean.” They must burn it up. Anyone “clean” may eat any other meat.
Leviticus,7,20,But suppose an “unclean” person eats any meat from the friendship offering that belongs to the Lord . Then they will be separated from their people.
Leviticus,7,21,Suppose someone touches something “unclean.” It does not matter whether it comes from a human being who is not “clean.” It does not matter whether it comes from an “unclean” animal. It does not matter whether it comes from something hated and “unclean.” And suppose they eat any of the meat from the friendship offering that belongs to the Lord . Then they will be separated from their people.’ ”
Leviticus,7,22,"The Lord spoke to Moses. He said,"
Leviticus,7,23,"“Speak to the Israelites. Tell them, ‘Do not eat any of the fat of cattle, sheep or goats."
Leviticus,7,24,Do not eat the fat of any animal found dead. Do not eat the fat of an animal that wild animals have torn apart. But you can use the fat for any other purpose.

Leviticus,7,30,They must bring it with their own hands. It is a food offering presented to the Lord . They must bring the fat together with the breast. They must lift the breast up and wave it in front of the Lord as a wave offering.
Leviticus,7,31,The priest will burn the fat on the altar. But the breast belongs to Aaron and the priests in his family line.
Leviticus,7,32,Give the right thigh from your friendship offerings to the priest as a gift.
Leviticus,7,33,The priest who offers the blood and fat from the friendship offering must be given the right thigh. It is his share.
Leviticus,7,34,"I, the Lord , have taken the breast that is waved and the thigh that is given. I have taken them from the friendship offerings of the Israelites.

Leviticus,7,35,That is the part of the food offerings presented to the Lord . It is given to Aaron and the priests in his family line. It was given to Aaron and his sons on the day they were set apart to serve the Lord as priests.
Leviticus,7,36,"On the day they were anointed, the Lord commanded the Israelites to give that part to them. For all time to come, it will be the share of Aaron and the priests in his family line."
Leviticus,7,37,"These are the rules for burnt offerings, grain offerings, sin offerings, guilt offerings and friendship offerings. They are also the rules for the offerings that are given when priests are being prepared to serve the Lord."
Leviticus,7,38,They are the rules the Lord gave Moses on Mount Sinai. He gave them on the day he commanded the Israelites to bring their offerings to the Lord . That took place in the Sinai Desert.
Leviticus,8,1,"The Lord spoke to Moses. He said,"
Leviticus,8,2,“Bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance to the tent of meeting. Bring their clothes and the anointing oil. Bring the bull for the sin offering. Also bring two rams. And bring the basket with the bread made without yeast.
Leviticus,8,3,Then gather the whole community at the entrance to the tent of meeting.”
Leviticus,8,4,Moses did just as the Lord had commanded him. All the people gathered together at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
Leviticus,8,5,"Moses said to the people, “Here is what the Lord has commanded us to do.”"
Leviticus,8,6,Then Moses brought Aaron and his sons to the people. He washed Aaron and his sons with water.
Leviticus,8,7,He put the inner robe on Aaron. He tied the belt around him. He dressed him in the outer robe. He put the linen apron on him. He took the skillfully made waistband and tied the apron on him with it. He wanted to make sure it was securely tied to him.
Leviticus,8,8,Moses placed the chest cloth on Aaron. He put the Urim and Thummim in the chest cloth.
Leviticus,8,9,Then he placed the turban on Aaron’s head. On the front of the turban he put the gold plate. It was a sacred crown. Moses did everything just as the Lord had commanded him.
Leviticus,8,10,Then Moses took the anointing oil and poured it on the holy tent. He also poured it on everything in it. That’s how he set apart those things for the Lord.
Leviticus,8,11,He sprinkled some of the oil on the altar seven times. He poured oil on the altar and all its tools. He poured it on the large bowl and its stand. He did it to set them apart.
Leviticus,8,12,He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head. He anointed him to set him apart to serve the Lord.
Leviticus,8,13,Then Moses brought Aaron’s sons to the people. He put the inner robes on them. He tied belts around them. He put caps on their heads. He did everything just as the Lord had commanded him.
Leviticus,8,14,Then he brought the bull for the sin offering. Aaron and his sons placed their hands on its head.
Leviticus,8,15,Moses killed the bull. He dipped his finger into some of the blood. He put it on the horns that stick out from the upper four corners of the altar. He did it to make the altar pure. He poured out the rest of the blood at the bottom of the altar. So he set it apart to make it pure.
Leviticus,8,16,Moses also removed all the fat around the inside parts of the bull. He removed the long part of the liver. He took both kidneys and their fat. Then he burned all of it on the altar.
Leviticus,8,17,"But he burned the rest of the bull outside the camp. He burned up its hide, its meat and its guts. He did it just as the Lord had commanded him."
Leviticus,8,18,Then Moses brought the ram for the burnt offering. Aaron and his sons placed their hands on its head.
Leviticus,8,19,Moses killed the ram. He splashed the blood against the sides of the altar.
Leviticus,8,20,"He cut the ram into pieces. He burned the head, the other pieces and the fat."
Leviticus,8,21,He washed the inside parts and the legs with water. He burned the whole ram on the altar as a burnt offering. It had a pleasant smell. It was a food offering presented to the Lord . Moses did everything just as the Lord had commanded him.
Leviticus,8,22,Then he brought the other ram. It was sacrificed to prepare the priests for serving the Lord . Aaron and his sons placed their hands on its head.
Leviticus,8,23,Moses killed the ram. He put some of its blood on Aaron’s right earlobe. He put some on the thumb of Aaron’s right hand. He also put some on the big toe of Aaron’s right foot.
Leviticus,8,24,Then Moses brought Aaron’s sons to the people. He put some of the blood on their right earlobes. He put some on the thumbs of their right hands. He also put some on the big toes of their right feet. Then he splashed the rest of the blood against the sides of the altar.
Leviticus,8,25,"He removed the fat, the fat tail and all the fat around the inside parts. He removed the long part of the liver. He removed both kidneys and their fat. And he removed the right thigh."
Leviticus,8,26,Then he took a thick loaf of bread from the basket of bread made without yeast. The basket was in front of the Lord . Moses took a thick loaf of bread made with olive oil. He also took a thin loaf of bread. He put all of it on the fat parts of the ram and on its right thigh.
Leviticus,8,27,He put everything in the hands of Aaron and his sons. He told them to lift it up and wave it in front of the Lord as a wave offering.
Leviticus,8,28,Then Moses took it from their hands. He burned it on the altar on top of the burnt offering. It was the offering that was sacrificed to prepare the priests for serving the Lord . It had a pleasant smell. It was a food offering presented to the Lord.
Leviticus,8,29,Moses also lifted up the ram’s breast and waved it in front of the Lord as a wave offering. The breast was Moses’ share of the ram that was sacrificed to prepare the priests for serving the Lord . Moses did everything just as the Lord had commanded him.
Leviticus,8,30,Then Moses took some of the anointing oil. He also took some of the blood from the altar. He sprinkled some of the oil and blood on Aaron and his clothes. He also sprinkled some on Aaron’s sons and their clothes. That’s how he set apart Aaron and his clothes. And that’s how he set apart Aaron’s sons and their clothes.
Leviticus,8,31,"Then Moses spoke to Aaron and his sons. He said, “Cook the meat at the entrance to the tent of meeting. Eat it there along with the bread from the basket of the offerings that are brought to prepare the priests for serving the Lord . Do it just as I was commanded. I was told, ‘Aaron and his sons must eat it.’"
Leviticus,8,32,Then burn up the rest of the meat and the bread.
Leviticus,8,33,Don’t leave the entrance to the tent of meeting for seven days. Don’t leave until the days that are required to prepare you for serving the Lord have been completed. Stay here for the full seven days.
Leviticus,8,34,The Lord commanded what has been done here today. It was done to pay for your sin.
Leviticus,8,35,Stay at the entrance to the tent of meeting for seven days. Stay here day and night. Do what the Lord requires. Then you won’t die. That’s the command the Lord gave me.”
Leviticus,8,36,So Aaron and his sons did everything just as the Lord had commanded through Moses.
Leviticus,9,1,"On the eighth day Moses sent for Aaron, his sons and the elders of Israel."
Leviticus,9,2,"He said to Aaron, “Bring a bull calf for your sin offering. Bring a ram for your burnt offering. They must not have any flaws. Offer them to the Lord."
Leviticus,9,3,"Then speak to the Israelites. Tell them, ‘Bring a male goat for a sin offering. Bring a calf and a lamb for a burnt offering. Both of them must be a year old. They must not have any flaws."
Leviticus,9,4,Bring an ox and a ram for a friendship offering. Sacrifice all of them to the Lord . Also bring a grain offering. Mix it with olive oil. Today the Lord will appear to you.’ ”
Leviticus,9,5,The people got the things Moses commanded them to get. They took them to the front of the tent of meeting. The whole community came up close to the tent. They stood there in front of the Lord.
Leviticus,9,6,"Then Moses said, “You have done what the Lord has commanded. So the glory of the Lord will appear to you.”"
Leviticus,9,7,"Moses said to Aaron, “Come to the altar. Sacrifice your sin offering and your burnt offering. Pay for your sin and the sin of the people. Sacrifice the people’s offering. Pay for their sin. Do just as the Lord has commanded.”"
Leviticus,9,8,So Aaron came to the altar. He killed the calf as a sin offering for himself.
Leviticus,9,9,His sons brought its blood to him. He dipped his finger into the blood. He put some on the horns that stick out from the upper four corners of the altar. He poured out the rest of the blood at the bottom of the altar.
Leviticus,9,10,He burned the fat and the kidneys on the altar. He also burned the long part of the liver. All these parts were from the sin offering. Aaron did just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
Leviticus,9,11,He burned up the meat and the hide outside the camp.
Leviticus,9,12,Then he killed the animal for the burnt offering. His sons handed him its blood. He splashed it against the sides of the altar.
Leviticus,9,13,They handed him the burnt offering piece by piece. It included the animal’s head. Aaron burned everything on the altar.
Leviticus,9,14,He washed the inside parts and the legs. He burned them on top of the burnt offering on the altar.
Leviticus,9,15,Then Aaron brought the people’s offering. He took the goat for their sin offering and killed it. He offered it for a sin offering. He did just as he had done with his own sin offering.
Leviticus,9,16,He brought the animal for the burnt offering. He offered it in the way the law requires.
Leviticus,9,17,He also brought the grain offering. He took a handful of it and burned it on the altar. It was in addition to that morning’s burnt offering.
Leviticus,9,18,Aaron killed the ox and the ram as the friendship offering for the people. His sons handed him the blood. He splashed it against the sides of the altar.
Leviticus,9,19,His sons also brought the fat parts of the ox and the ram. They included the fat tail and the layer of fat. They also included the kidneys and the long part of the liver.
Leviticus,9,20,Aaron’s sons placed everything on the breasts of the animals. Aaron burned the fat on the altar.
Leviticus,9,21,He lifted up the breasts and the right thigh and waved them in front of the Lord as a wave offering. He did it just as Moses had commanded.
Leviticus,9,22,"Then Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people. He gave them a blessing. He had already sacrificed the sin offering, the burnt offering and the friendship offering. So he stepped down from the altar."
Leviticus,9,23,"Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting. When they came out, they gave the people a blessing. The glory of the Lord appeared to all the people."
Leviticus,9,24,The Lord sent fire on the altar. The fire burned up the burnt offering along with the fat parts. All the people saw it. Then they shouted for joy. They fell with their faces to the ground.
Leviticus,10,1,Nadab and Abihu were two of Aaron’s sons. They got their shallow cups for burning incense. They put fire in them. They added incense to it. They made an offering to the Lord by using fire that wasn’t allowed. They did it against his command.
Leviticus,10,2,So the Lord sent fire on them. It burned them up. They died in front of the Lord.
Leviticus,10,3,"Then Moses spoke to Aaron. He said, “That’s what the Lord was talking about when he said, “ ‘Among those who approach me I will show that I am holy. In the sight of all the people I will be honored.’ ” So Aaron remained silent."
Leviticus,10,4,"Moses sent for Mishael and Elzaphan. They were sons of Aaron’s uncle Uzziel. Moses said to them, “Come here. Carry the bodies of your cousins outside the camp. Take them away from in front of the Holy Room.”"
Leviticus,10,5,So they came and carried them outside the camp. It was just as Moses had ordered. The bodies of Nadab and Abihu still had their inner robes on them.
Leviticus,10,6,"Moses spoke to Aaron and to Eleazar and Ithamar. They were Aaron’s sons. Moses said, “Don’t let your hair hang loose. Don’t tear your clothes. If you do, you will die. And the Lord will be angry with the whole community. But all the Israelites are allowed to show they are sad. They are your relatives. They may mourn for those the Lord has destroyed with fire."
Leviticus,10,7,"Don’t leave the entrance to the tent of meeting. If you do, you will die. That’s because the Lord ’s anointing oil has made you holy.” So they did what Moses told them to do."
Leviticus,10,8,"Then the Lord spoke to Aaron. He said,"
Leviticus,10,9,"“You and your sons will go into the tent of meeting. When you do, you must not drink any kind of wine. If you do, you will die. This is a law that will last for all time to come."
Leviticus,10,10,This is so that you can tell the difference between what is holy and what is not. You must be able to tell the difference between what is ‘clean’ and what is not.
Leviticus,10,11,Then you will be able to teach the Israelites all the rules I have given them through Moses.”
Leviticus,10,12,"Moses spoke to Aaron and to Eleazar and Ithamar. They were Aaron’s two remaining sons. Moses said, “Take the grain offering left over from the food offerings presented to the Lord . It is very holy. Make bread without yeast from it. Eat it beside the altar."
Leviticus,10,13,Eat it in the holy area. It’s your share and your sons’ share of the food offerings presented to the Lord . These rules are in keeping with the command the Lord gave me.
Leviticus,10,14,But you and your sons and your daughters can eat the breast that was waved. You can also eat the thigh that was offered. Eat them in a ‘clean’ place. They have been given to you and your children. They are your share of the friendship offerings the Israelites bring.
Leviticus,10,15,The thigh that was offered must be brought together with the fat parts of the food offerings. The breast that was waved must be brought in the same way. All of it must be lifted up and waved in front of the Lord as a wave offering. It will be the share for you and your children for all time to come. That’s what the Lord has commanded.”
Leviticus,10,16,"Moses asked about the goat that was brought as the sin offering. He found out that it had been burned up. So he became angry with Eleazar and Ithamar. They were Aaron’s two remaining sons. Moses asked them,"
Leviticus,10,17,“Why didn’t you eat the sin offering in a place near the Holy Room? The offering is very holy. It was given to you to take the people’s guilt away. It paid for their sin in the sight of the Lord.
Leviticus,10,18,The blood of the offering wasn’t taken into the Holy Room. So you should have eaten the goat in a place near the Holy Room. That’s what I commanded.”
Leviticus,10,19,"Aaron replied to Moses, “Today the people sacrificed their sin offering to the Lord . They also sacrificed their burnt offerings to him. But a terrible thing has happened to me. Two of my sons have died. Would the Lord have been pleased if I had eaten the sin offering today?”"
Leviticus,10,20,"When Moses heard that, he was satisfied."
Leviticus,11,1,"The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron. He said to them,"
Leviticus,11,2,"“Speak to the Israelites. Tell them, ‘Many animals live on land. Here are the only ones you can eat."
Leviticus,11,3,You can eat any animal that has hooves that are separated completely in two. But it must also chew the cud.
Leviticus,11,4,“ ‘Some animals only chew the cud. Some only have hooves that are separated in two. You must not eat those animals. Camels chew the cud. But their hooves are not separated in two. So they are “unclean” for you.
Leviticus,11,5,Rock badgers chew the cud. But their hooves are not separated in two. So they are “unclean” for you.
Leviticus,11,6,Rabbits chew the cud. But their hooves are not separated in two. So they are “unclean” for you.
Leviticus,11,7,Pigs have hooves that are separated completely in two. But they do not chew the cud. So they are “unclean” for you.
Leviticus,11,8,You must not eat the meat of those animals. You must not even touch their dead bodies. They are “unclean” for you.
Leviticus,11,9,“ ‘Many creatures live in the water of the oceans and streams. You can eat all those that have fins and scales.
Leviticus,11,10,Treat as “unclean” all the creatures in the oceans or streams that do not have fins and scales. That includes all those that move together in groups and all those that do not.
Leviticus,11,11,Treat them as “unclean.” Do not eat their meat. Treat their dead bodies as “unclean.”
Leviticus,11,12,Regard as “unclean” everything that lives in the water that does not have fins and scales.
Leviticus,11,13,"“ ‘Here are the birds you must treat as “unclean.” Do not eat them because they are “unclean.” The birds include eagles, vultures and black vultures."
Leviticus,11,14,They include red kites and all kinds of black kites.
Leviticus,11,15,They include all kinds of ravens.
Leviticus,11,16,"They include horned owls, screech owls, gulls and all kinds of hawks."
Leviticus,11,17,"They include little owls, cormorants and great owls."
Leviticus,11,18,"They include white owls, desert owls and ospreys."
Leviticus,11,19,"They also include storks, hoopoes, bats and all kinds of herons."
Leviticus,11,20,“ ‘Treat as “unclean” every flying insect that walks on all fours.
Leviticus,11,21,But you can eat some flying insects that walk on all fours. Their legs have joints so they can hop on the ground.
Leviticus,11,22,"Here are the insects you can eat. You can eat all kinds of locusts, katydids, crickets and grasshoppers."
Leviticus,11,23,Treat as “unclean” every other creature with wings and four legs.
Leviticus,11,24,"“ ‘You will make yourselves “unclean” if you eat these things. If you touch their dead bodies, you will be “unclean” until evening."
Leviticus,11,25,"If a person picks up one of their dead bodies, that person must wash their clothes. They will be “unclean” until evening."
Leviticus,11,26,"“ ‘Suppose an animal has hooves that are not separated completely in two. Or suppose an animal does not chew the cud. Then these animals are “unclean” for you. If you touch the dead body of any of them, you will be “unclean.”"
Leviticus,11,27,Many animals walk on all fours. But those that walk on their paws are “unclean” for you. Anyone who touches their dead bodies will be “unclean” until evening.
Leviticus,11,28,"If a person picks up their dead bodies, that person must wash their clothes. They will be “unclean” until evening. These animals are “unclean” for you."
Leviticus,11,29,"“ ‘Many animals move along the ground. Here are the ones that are “unclean” for you. They include weasels, rats and all kinds of large lizards."
Leviticus,11,30,"They also include geckos, monitor lizards, wall lizards, skinks and chameleons."
Leviticus,11,31,"These are the animals that move around on the ground that are “unclean” for you. If you touch their dead bodies, you will be “unclean” until evening."
Leviticus,11,32,"Suppose one of them dies and falls on something. Then that thing will be “unclean.” It does not matter what it is used for. It does not matter whether it is made out of wood, cloth, hide or rough cloth. Put it in water. It will be “unclean” until evening. After that, it will be “clean.”"
Leviticus,11,33,Suppose one of these animals falls into a clay pot. Then everything in the pot will be “unclean.” You must break the pot.
Leviticus,11,34,Any food that could be eaten but has water on it that came from that pot is “unclean.” And any liquid that could be drunk from it is “unclean.”
Leviticus,11,35,"Anything that the dead body of one of these animals falls on becomes “unclean.” If it is an oven or cooking pot, break it. It is “unclean.” And you must consider it “unclean.”"
Leviticus,11,36,But a spring or a well for collecting water remains “clean.” That is true even if the dead body of one of these animals falls into it. But anyone who touches the dead body is not “clean.”
Leviticus,11,37,"If the dead body falls on any seeds that have not been planted yet, the seeds remain “clean.”"
Leviticus,11,38,But suppose water has already been put on the seeds. And suppose the dead body falls on them. Then they are “unclean” for you.
Leviticus,11,39,"“ ‘Suppose an animal you are allowed to eat dies. If anyone touches its dead body, they will be “unclean” until evening."
Leviticus,11,40,"If they eat part of the dead body, they must wash their clothes. They will be “unclean” until evening. If they pick up the dead body, they must wash their clothes. They will be “unclean” until evening."
Leviticus,11,41,“ ‘Treat as “unclean” every creature that moves along the ground. Do not eat it.
Leviticus,11,42,Do not eat any of these creatures. It does not matter whether they move on their bellies. It does not matter whether they walk on all fours or on many feet. It is “unclean.”
Leviticus,11,43,Do not make yourselves “unclean” by eating any of these animals. Do not make yourselves “unclean” because of them. Do not let them make you “unclean.”
Leviticus,11,44,"I am the Lord your God. Set yourselves apart. Be holy, because I am holy. Do not make yourselves “unclean” by eating any creatures that move around on the ground."
Leviticus,11,45,"I am the Lord . I brought you up out of Egypt to be your God. So be holy, because I am holy."
Leviticus,11,46,“ ‘These are the rules about animals and birds. These are the rules about every living thing that moves around in the water. And these are the rules about every creature that moves along the ground.
Leviticus,11,47,You must be able to tell the difference between what is “clean” and what is not. You must also be able to tell the difference between living creatures that can be eaten and those that can’t.’ ”
Leviticus,12,1,"The Lord spoke to Moses. He said,"
Leviticus,12,2,"“Speak to the Israelites. Tell them, ‘Suppose a woman becomes pregnant and has a baby boy. Then she will be “unclean” for seven days. It is the same as when she is “unclean” during her monthly period."
Leviticus,12,3,On the eighth day the boy must be circumcised.
Leviticus,12,4,"After that, the woman must wait for 33 days to be made pure from her bleeding. She must not touch anything sacred until the 33 days are over. During that time she must not go to the sacred tent."
Leviticus,12,5,"But suppose she has a baby girl. Then she will be “unclean” for two weeks. It is the same as during her period. After the two weeks, she must wait for 66 days to be made pure from her bleeding."
Leviticus,12,6,"“ ‘After she has waited the required number of days to be made pure, she must bring two offerings. She must take them to the priest at the entrance to the tent of meeting. She must bring a lamb a year old for a burnt offering. She must also bring a young pigeon or a dove for a sin offering."
Leviticus,12,7,The priest must offer them to the Lord . They will pay for her sin. Then she will be “clean” from her bleeding. “ ‘These are the rules for a woman who has a baby boy or girl.
Leviticus,12,8,But suppose she can’t afford a lamb. Then she must bring two doves or two young pigeons. One is for a burnt offering. The other is for a sin offering. The priest will sacrifice those offerings. That will pay for her sin. And she will be “clean.” ’ ”
Leviticus,13,1,"The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron. He told them to say to the people,"
Leviticus,13,2,“Suppose someone’s skin has a swelling or a rash or a shiny spot. And suppose it could become a skin disease. Then they must be brought to the priest Aaron. Or they must be brought to a priest in Aaron’s family line.
Leviticus,13,3,"The priest must look carefully at the sore on the person’s skin. He must see whether the hair in the sore has turned white. He must also see whether the sore seems to be under the skin. If the sore is white and is under the skin, it is a skin disease. When the priest looks that person over carefully, he must announce that the person is ‘unclean.’"
Leviticus,13,4,Suppose the shiny spot on the skin is white but does not seem to be under the skin. And suppose the hair in the spot has not turned white. Then the priest must make the person stay away from everyone else for seven days.
Leviticus,13,5,On the seventh day the priest must look carefully at the sore again. Suppose it has not changed and has not spread in the skin. Then the priest must make the person stay away from everyone else for another seven days.
Leviticus,13,6,"On the seventh day the priest must look carefully at the sore again. If it has faded and has not spread, he must announce that the person is ‘clean.’ It is only a rash. That person must wash their clothes. They will be ‘clean.’"
Leviticus,13,7,But suppose the rash spreads in the skin after they have shown themselves to the priest a second time. Then they must appear in front of the priest again.
Leviticus,13,8,"The priest must look carefully at the sore. If the rash has spread, he must announce that the person is ‘unclean.’ They have a skin disease."
Leviticus,13,9,"“When anyone has a skin disease, they must be brought to the priest."
Leviticus,13,10,The priest must look them over carefully. Suppose there is a white swelling in the skin. Suppose it has turned the hair white. And suppose there are open sores in the swelling.
Leviticus,13,11,Then the person has a skin disease that will never go away. The priest must announce that they are ‘unclean.’ The priest must not make them stay away from everyone else. They are already ‘unclean.’
Leviticus,13,12,"“Suppose the disease breaks out all over their skin. And suppose it covers them from head to foot, as far as the priest can tell."
Leviticus,13,13,"Then the priest must look them over carefully. If the disease has covered their whole body, the priest must announce that they are ‘clean.’ All their skin has turned white. So they are ‘clean.’"
Leviticus,13,14,"But when open sores appear on their skin, they will not be ‘clean.’"
Leviticus,13,15,"When the priest sees the open sores, he must announce that they are ‘unclean.’ The open sores are not ‘clean.’ They have a skin disease."
Leviticus,13,16,"But if the open sores change and turn white, they must go to the priest."
Leviticus,13,17,"The priest must look them over carefully. If the sores have turned white, the priest must announce that the person is ‘clean.’ Then they will be ‘clean.’"
Leviticus,13,18,“Suppose someone has a boil on their skin and it heals.
Leviticus,13,19,And suppose a white swelling or shiny pink spot appears where the boil was. Then they must show themselves to the priest.
Leviticus,13,20,The priest must look at the boil carefully. Suppose it seems to be under the skin. And suppose the hair in it has turned white. Then the priest must announce that the person is ‘unclean.’ A skin disease has broken out where the boil was.
Leviticus,13,21,"But suppose that when the priest looks at the boil carefully, there is no white hair in it. The boil is not under the skin. And it has faded. Then the priest must make the person stay away from everyone else for seven days."
Leviticus,13,22,"If the boil is spreading in the skin, the priest must announce that the person is ‘unclean.’ They have a skin disease."
Leviticus,13,23,But suppose the spot has not changed. And suppose it has not spread. Then it is only a scar from the boil. And the priest must announce that the person is ‘clean.’
Leviticus,13,24,“Suppose someone has a burn on their skin. And suppose a white or shiny pink spot shows up in the open sores of the burn.
Leviticus,13,25,Then the priest must look at the spot carefully. Suppose the hair in it has turned white. And suppose the spot seems to be under the skin. Then the person has a skin disease. It has broken out where they were burned. The priest must announce that the person is ‘unclean.’ They have a skin disease.
Leviticus,13,26,But suppose the priest looks at the spot carefully. Suppose there is no white hair in it. Suppose the spot is not under the skin. And suppose it has faded. Then the priest must make the person stay away from everyone else for seven days.
Leviticus,13,27,"On the seventh day the priest must look them over carefully. If the spot is spreading in the skin, the priest must announce that the person is ‘unclean.’ They have a skin disease."
Leviticus,13,28,But suppose the spot has not changed. It has not spread in the skin. And it has faded. Then the burn has caused it to swell. The priest must announce that the person is ‘clean.’ It is only a scar from the burn.
Leviticus,13,29,“Suppose a man or woman has a sore on their head or chin.
Leviticus,13,30,Then the priest must look at the sore carefully. Suppose it seems to be under the skin. And suppose the hair in the sore is yellow and thin. Then the priest must announce that the person is ‘unclean.’ The sore is a skin disease on the head or chin.
Leviticus,13,31,But suppose the priest looks carefully at the sore. It does not seem to be under the skin. And there is no black hair in it. Then the priest must make the person stay away from everyone else for seven days.
Leviticus,13,32,On the seventh day the priest must look at the sore carefully. Suppose it has not spread in the skin. It does not have any yellow hair in it. And it does not seem to be under the skin.
Leviticus,13,33,Then the man or woman must shave their head. But they must not shave the area where the disease is. And the priest must make them stay away from everyone else for another seven days.
Leviticus,13,34,On the seventh day the priest must look at the sore carefully. Suppose it has not spread in the skin. And suppose it does not seem to be under the skin. Then the priest must announce that the person is ‘clean.’ They must wash their clothes. They will be ‘clean.’
Leviticus,13,35,But suppose the sore spreads in the skin after the priest announces that the person is ‘clean.’
Leviticus,13,36,Then the priest must look them over carefully. Suppose the sore has spread. Then the priest does not have to look for yellow hair. The person is ‘unclean.’
Leviticus,13,37,"But suppose the sore has stopped and black hair has grown there, as far as the priest can tell. Then the person is healed and is ‘clean.’ The priest must announce that they are ‘clean.’"
Leviticus,13,38,“Suppose a man or woman has white spots on the skin.
Leviticus,13,39,Then the priest must look at them carefully. Suppose he sees that the spots are dull white. Then a harmless rash has broken out on the skin. That person is ‘clean.’
Leviticus,13,40,“Suppose a man loses all the hair on his head. Then he is ‘clean.’
Leviticus,13,41,Suppose he loses only the hair on the front of his head. Then he is ‘clean.’
Leviticus,13,42,But suppose he has a shiny pink sore on his head where his hair was. Then he has a skin disease. It is breaking out on his whole head or on the front of his head.
Leviticus,13,43,The priest must look him over carefully. Suppose the swollen sore on his head or on the front of it is pink and shiny. And suppose it looks like a skin disease.
Leviticus,13,44,Then he has a skin disease. He is ‘unclean.’ The priest must announce that the man is ‘unclean.’ That’s because he has a sore on his head.
Leviticus,13,45,"“Suppose someone has a skin disease that makes them ‘unclean.’ Then they must wear torn clothes. They must let their hair hang loose. They must cover the lower part of their face. They must cry out, ‘Unclean! Unclean!’"
Leviticus,13,46,"As long as they have the disease, they remain ‘unclean.’ They must live alone. They must live outside the camp."
Leviticus,13,47,“Suppose some clothes have mold on them. The clothes could be made out of wool or linen.
Leviticus,13,48,Or there could be cloth woven or knitted out of linen or wool. There could be pieces of leather. Or there could be things that are made out of leather.
Leviticus,13,49,And suppose the mold on the clothes or on the woven or knitted cloth looks green or red. Or suppose the green or red mold is on the pieces of leather or the leather goods. Then it is mold that spreads. It must be shown to the priest.
Leviticus,13,50,The priest must look at it carefully. He must keep the thing with the mold on it away from everything else for seven days.
Leviticus,13,51,On the seventh day he must look at it carefully. Suppose the mold has spread in the clothes or in the woven or knitted cloth. Or suppose it has spread on the pieces of leather or on the leather goods. Then it is mold that destroys. The thing is ‘unclean.’
Leviticus,13,52,The priest must burn everything with the mold in it. He must burn the clothes or the woven or knitted cloth made out of wool or linen. He must burn the leather goods. The mold destroys. So everything must be burned.
Leviticus,13,53,“But suppose the priest looks at the thing carefully. The mold has not spread in the clothes. And it has not spread in the woven or knitted cloth or in the leather goods.
Leviticus,13,54,"Then he will order someone to wash the thing with the mold on it. After that, the priest must keep that thing away from everything else for another seven days."
Leviticus,13,55,"After the thing with the mold on it has been washed, the priest must look at it again carefully. Suppose the way the mold looks has not changed. Then even though the mold has not spread, it is ‘unclean.’ Burn it. It does not matter which side of the thing the mold is on."
Leviticus,13,56,But suppose the priest looks at it carefully. And suppose the mold has faded after the thing has been washed. Then the priest must tear out the part with mold on it. He must tear it out of the clothes or leather. He must tear it out of the woven or knitted cloth.
Leviticus,13,57,But suppose it shows up again in the clothes. Or suppose it shows up again in the woven or knitted cloth or in the leather goods. Then it is spreading. Everything with the mold on it must be burned.
Leviticus,13,58,The clothes that have been washed and do not have any more mold on them must be washed again. So must the woven or knitted cloth or the leather goods. Then they will be ‘clean.’ ”
Leviticus,13,59,These are the rules about what to do with anything with mold on it. They apply to clothes that are made out of wool or linen. They apply to woven and knitted cloth and to leather goods. They give a priest directions about when to announce whether something is “clean” or “unclean.”
Leviticus,14,1,"The Lord spoke to Moses. He told him to say to the people,"
Leviticus,14,2,“Here are the rules for making anyone ‘clean’ who has had a skin disease. They apply when the person is brought to the priest.
Leviticus,14,3,The priest must go outside the camp. He must look the person over carefully. Suppose they have been healed of their skin disease.
Leviticus,14,4,"Then the priest will order someone to bring him two live ‘clean’ birds. He will also order someone to bring him some cedar wood, bright red yarn and branches of a hyssop plant. All these things will be used to make the person ‘clean.’"
Leviticus,14,5,The priest will order someone to kill one of the birds. It must be killed over fresh water in a clay pot.
Leviticus,14,6,"Then the priest must take the live bird. He must dip it into the blood of the bird killed over the fresh water. He must dip it into the blood together with the cedar wood, the bright red yarn and the hyssop plant."
Leviticus,14,7,"The priest will sprinkle the blood on the person who had the skin disease. That will make them ‘clean.’ The priest must sprinkle them seven times. Then the priest must announce that they are ‘clean.’ After that, the priest must let the live bird go free in the open fields."
Leviticus,14,8,"“The person must also wash their clothes to be made ‘clean.’ They must shave off all their hair. They must take a bath. Then they will be ‘clean.’ After that, they may come into the camp. But they must stay outside their tent for seven days."
Leviticus,14,9,On the seventh day they must shave off all their hair. They must shave their head. They must shave off their beard. They must also shave off their eyebrows and the rest of their hair. They must wash their clothes. They must take a bath. Then they will be ‘clean.’
Leviticus,14,10,“On the eighth day they must bring two male lambs and one female lamb as an offering. The female must be a year old. The lambs must not have any flaws. They must also bring 11 pounds of the finest flour as a grain offering. They must mix it with olive oil. They must also bring 11 ounces of oil.
Leviticus,14,11,The priest who announces that the person is ‘clean’ must bring them and their offerings to me. He must do it at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
Leviticus,14,12,“Then the priest must take one of the male lambs. He must offer it as a guilt offering. He must offer it along with 11 ounces of oil. He must lift all of it up and wave it in front of me as a wave offering.
Leviticus,14,13,"He must kill the lamb in the holy area where sin offerings and burnt offerings are killed. The guilt offering belongs to the priest, just as the sin offering does. The guilt offering is very holy."
Leviticus,14,14,The priest must take some of the blood from the guilt offering and put it on the person’s right earlobe. He must put some on the thumb of their right hand. He must also put some on the big toe of their right foot.
Leviticus,14,15,Then the priest must take some of the oil and pour it into his own left hand.
Leviticus,14,16,He must dip his right forefinger into the oil in his hand. He must use his finger to sprinkle some of the oil in front of me seven times.
Leviticus,14,17,The priest must put some of the oil in his hand on the same places he put the blood of the guilt offering. He must put some on the person’s right earlobe. He must put some on the thumb of their right hand. He must put some on the big toe of their right foot.
Leviticus,14,18,He must put on their head the rest of the oil in his hand. It will pay for the person’s sin in my sight.
Leviticus,14,19,"“Then the priest must sacrifice the sin offering. It will pay for the person’s sin. They will be made ‘clean’ after being ‘unclean.’ After that, the priest will kill the burnt offering."
Leviticus,14,20,He will offer it on the altar. He will offer it together with the grain offering. It will pay for the person’s sin. Then they will be ‘clean.’
Leviticus,14,21,“But suppose they are poor. Suppose they can’t afford all these offerings. Then they must bring one male lamb as a guilt offering. It must be lifted up and waved in front of me to pay for their sin. They must also bring three and a half pounds of the finest flour along with the lamb. They must mix the flour with olive oil. It is a grain offering. They must offer it along with 11 ounces of oil.
Leviticus,14,22,They must also bring two doves or two young pigeons that they can afford. One is for a sin offering. The other is for a burnt offering.
Leviticus,14,23,“On the eighth day they must bring them to the priest so they can be made ‘clean.’ They must bring them to the entrance to the tent of meeting. They must do it in my sight.
Leviticus,14,24,The priest must take the lamb for the guilt offering. He must take it together with the 11 ounces of oil. He must lift all of it up and wave it in front of me as a wave offering.
Leviticus,14,25,He must kill the lamb for the guilt offering. He must take some of its blood and put it on the person’s right earlobe. He must put some on the thumb of their right hand. He must also put some on the big toe of their right foot.
Leviticus,14,26,The priest must pour some of the oil into his own left hand.
Leviticus,14,27,He must dip his right forefinger into the oil in his hand. He must use his finger to sprinkle some of it seven times in front of me.
Leviticus,14,28,Here is what he must do with some of the oil in his hand. He must put it on the same places where he put the blood of the guilt offering. He must put some on the person’s right earlobe. He must put some on the thumb of their right hand. He must also put some on the big toe of their right foot.
Leviticus,14,29,He must put on their head the rest of the oil in his hand. It will pay for the person’s sin in my sight.
Leviticus,14,30,The priest will sacrifice the doves or the young pigeons that the person can afford.
Leviticus,14,31,One is for a sin offering. The other is for a burnt offering. The priest must offer them together with the grain offering. In that way he will pay for the person’s sin in my sight. He will do it to make them ‘clean.’ ”
Leviticus,14,32,These are the rules for anyone who has a skin disease. They are for people who can’t afford the regular offerings that are required to make them “clean.”
Leviticus,14,33,"The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron. He told them to say to the people,"
Leviticus,14,34,"“You will enter the land of Canaan. I am giving it to you as your own. When you enter it, suppose I put mold in one of your houses. And suppose the mold spreads."
Leviticus,14,35,"Then the owner of that house must go and speak to the priest. He must say, ‘I’ve seen something that looks like mold in my house.’"
Leviticus,14,36,"The priest must order everything to be taken out of the house. It must be done before he goes in to look carefully at the mold. If it is not done, the priest must announce that everything in the house is ‘unclean.’ After the house is empty the priest must go in and check it."
Leviticus,14,37,He must look carefully at the mold on the walls. Suppose it looks as if it has green or red dents in it. And suppose the dents look as if they are behind the surface of the wall.
Leviticus,14,38,Then the priest must go out the door. He must close the house up for seven days.
Leviticus,14,39,On the seventh day the priest will return to check the house. Suppose the mold on the walls has spread.
Leviticus,14,40,Then he must order someone to tear out the stones that have mold on them. He must have them thrown into an ‘unclean’ place outside the town.
Leviticus,14,41,He must have all the inside walls of the house scraped. Everything scraped off must be dumped into an ‘unclean’ place outside the town.
Leviticus,14,42,Then other stones must be put in the place of the stones that had mold on them. The inside walls of the house must be coated with new clay.
Leviticus,14,43,“Suppose the stones have been torn out. The house has been scraped. And the walls have been coated with new clay. But the mold appears again.
Leviticus,14,44,Then the priest must go and look things over carefully. Suppose the mold has spread in the house. Then it is the kind of mold that destroys things. The house is not ‘clean.’
Leviticus,14,45,"It must be torn down. The stones, the wood and all the clay coating must be torn out. All of it must be taken out of the town to an ‘unclean’ place."
Leviticus,14,46,“Suppose someone goes into the house while it is closed up. Then they will be ‘unclean’ until evening.
Leviticus,14,47,"If they sleep or eat in the house, they must wash their clothes."
Leviticus,14,48,“But suppose the priest comes to look things over carefully. And suppose the mold has not spread after the walls had been coated with new clay. Then he will announce that the house is ‘clean.’ The mold is gone.
Leviticus,14,49,"To make the house pure, the priest must get two birds. He must also get some cedar wood, bright red yarn and branches of a hyssop plant."
Leviticus,14,50,He must kill one of the birds over fresh water in a clay pot.
Leviticus,14,51,"Then he must take the cedar wood, the hyssop plant, the bright red yarn and the live bird. He must dip all of them into the blood of the dead bird. He must also dip them into the fresh water. He must sprinkle the house seven times."
Leviticus,14,52,"The priest will use the blood and the water to make the house pure. He will use the live bird to make it pure. He will also use the cedar wood, the hyssop plant and the bright red yarn to make it pure."
Leviticus,14,53,Then he must let the live bird go free in the open fields outside the town. In that way he will make the house pure. It will be ‘clean.’ ”
Leviticus,14,54,These are the rules for skin diseases. They apply to sores.
Leviticus,14,55,They apply to mold in clothes or in houses.
Leviticus,14,56,"They also apply to swellings, rashes or shiny red spots on the skin."
Leviticus,14,57,Use these rules to decide whether something is “clean” or not. These are the rules for skin diseases and for mold.
Leviticus,15,1,"The Lord said to Moses and Aaron,"
Leviticus,15,2,"“Speak to the Israelites. Tell them, ‘Suppose liquid waste is flowing out of a man’s body. That liquid is not “clean.”"
Leviticus,15,3,It does not matter whether it continues to flow out of his body or is blocked. It will make him “unclean.” Here is how his liquid body waste will make him “unclean.”
Leviticus,15,4,“ ‘Any bed the man who has the flow of liquid body waste lies on will be “unclean.” Anything he sits on will be “unclean.”
Leviticus,15,5,Anyone who touches the man’s bed must wash their clothes. They must take a bath. They will be “unclean” until evening.
Leviticus,15,6,Suppose someone sits on something the man sat on. Then they must wash their clothes. They must take a bath. They will be “unclean” until evening.
Leviticus,15,7,“ ‘Suppose someone touches the man who has the flow of liquid body waste. Then they must wash their clothes. They must take a bath. They will be “unclean” until evening.
Leviticus,15,8,“ ‘Suppose someone is “clean.” And suppose the man who has the flow of liquid waste spits on them. Then they must wash their clothes. They must take a bath. They will be “unclean” until evening.
Leviticus,15,9,“ ‘Everything the man sits on when he is riding will be “unclean.”

Leviticus,15,11,“ ‘Suppose the man who has the liquid flow touches someone. And suppose he does it without rinsing his hands with water. Then the person he touched must wash their clothes. They must take a bath. They will be “unclean” until evening.
Leviticus,15,12,“ ‘Suppose the man touches a clay pot. Then that pot must be broken. Any wooden thing he touches must be rinsed with water.
Leviticus,15,13,"“ ‘Suppose the man has been healed from his liquid flow. Then he must wait seven days. He must wash his clothes. He must take a bath in fresh water. After that, he will be “clean.”"
Leviticus,15,14,On the eighth day he must get two doves or two young pigeons. He must come to the Lord at the entrance to the tent of meeting. There he must give the birds to the priest.
Leviticus,15,15,The priest must sacrifice them. One is for a sin offering. The other is for a burnt offering. In that way the priest will pay for the man’s sin in the sight of the Lord . He will do it because the man had a liquid flow.
Leviticus,15,16,“ ‘Suppose semen flows from a man’s body. Then he must wash his whole body with water. He will be “unclean” until evening.
Leviticus,15,17,Suppose clothes or leather have semen on them. Then they must be washed with water. They will be “unclean” until evening.
Leviticus,15,18,Suppose a man sleeps with a woman. And suppose semen flows from his body and touches both of them. Then they must take a bath. They will be “unclean” until evening.
Leviticus,15,19,“ ‘Suppose a woman is having her regular monthly period. Then for seven days she will be “unclean.” Anyone who touches her will be “unclean” until evening.
Leviticus,15,20,“ ‘Anything she lies on during her period will be “unclean.” Anything she sits on will be “unclean.”
Leviticus,15,21,Anyone who touches her bed must wash their clothes. They must take a bath. They will be “unclean” until evening.
Leviticus,15,22,Anyone who touches anything she sits on must wash their clothes. They must take a bath. They will be “unclean” until evening.
Leviticus,15,23,"It does not matter whether it was her bed or anything she was sitting on. If anyone touches it, they will be “unclean” until evening."
Leviticus,15,24,“ ‘Suppose a man sleeps with that woman. And suppose blood from her monthly period touches him. Then he will be “unclean” for seven days. Any bed he lies on will be “unclean.”
Leviticus,15,25,"“ ‘Suppose blood flows from a woman’s body for many days. And it happens at a time other than her monthly period. Or blood keeps flowing after her period is over. Then she will be “unclean” as long as the blood continues to flow. She will be “unclean,” just as she is during the days of her period."
Leviticus,15,26,Any bed she lies on while her blood continues to flow will be “unclean.” It is the same as it is when she is having her period. Anything she sits on will be “unclean.”
Leviticus,15,27,"If anyone touches those things, they will be “unclean.” They must wash their clothes. They must take a bath. They will be “unclean” until evening."

Leviticus,15,30,The priest must sacrifice them. One is for a sin offering. The other is for a burnt offering. In that way he will pay for her sin in the sight of the Lord . He will do it because her flow of blood made her “unclean.”
Leviticus,15,31,"“ ‘You must keep the Israelites away from things that make them “unclean.” Then they will not die for being “unclean.” And they will not die for making the place “unclean” where I, the Lord , live. It is in the middle of the camp.’ ”"
Leviticus,15,32,These are the rules for a man who has liquid waste flowing out of his body. They apply to a man made “unclean” by semen that flows from his body.
Leviticus,15,33,They apply to a woman having her monthly period. They apply to a man or woman who has a liquid flow. And they apply to a man who sleeps with a woman who is “unclean.”
Leviticus,16,1,The Lord spoke to Moses after two of Aaron’s sons had died. They were the sons who died when they came near the Lord.
Leviticus,16,2,"The Lord said to Moses, “Speak to your brother Aaron. Tell him not to come into the Most Holy Room just anytime he wants to. Tell him not to come behind the curtain in front of the cover of the ark. The cover is the place where sin is paid for. If he comes behind the curtain, he will die. That is because I appear in the cloud over the cover."
Leviticus,16,3,“Aaron must not enter the area of the Most Holy Room without bringing a sacrifice. He must bring a young bull for a sin offering. He must also bring a ram for a burnt offering.
Leviticus,16,4,He must put on the sacred inner robe made out of linen. He must wear linen underwear next to his body. He must tie the linen belt around him. And he must put the linen turban on his head. Those are sacred clothes. So he must take a bath before he puts them on.
Leviticus,16,5,The community of Israel must give him two male goats and a ram. The goats are for a sin offering. The ram is for a burnt offering.
Leviticus,16,6,“Aaron must offer the bull for his own sin offering. It will pay for his own sin and the sin of his whole family.
Leviticus,16,7,Then he must take the two goats and bring them to me at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
Leviticus,16,8,He must cast lots for the two goats. One lot is for me. The other is for the goat that carries the people’s sins away.
Leviticus,16,9,Aaron must bring the goat chosen for me by lot. He must sacrifice it for a sin offering.
Leviticus,16,10,"But the goat chosen by the other lot must remain alive. First, it must be brought in to me to pay for the people’s sins. Then, it must be sent into the desert as a goat that carries the people’s sins away."
Leviticus,16,11,“Aaron must bring the bull for his own sin offering. It will pay for his own sin and the sin of his whole family. He must kill the bull for his own sin offering.
Leviticus,16,12,He must take a shallow cup full of burning coals from the altar in my sight. He must get two handfuls of incense completely ground up. The incense must smell sweet. He must take the cup and the incense behind the curtain.
Leviticus,16,13,He must put the incense on the fire in my sight. The smoke from the incense will hide the cover of the ark where the tablets of the covenant law are kept. The cover is the place where sin is paid for. Aaron must burn the incense so that he will not die.
Leviticus,16,14,He must dip his finger in the bull’s blood. He must sprinkle it on the front of the cover of the ark. He must sprinkle some in front of the cover. He must do it seven times.
Leviticus,16,15,“Then Aaron must kill the goat for the sin offering for the people. He must take its blood behind the curtain. There he must do the same thing with it as he did with the bull’s blood. He must sprinkle it on the cover of the ark. He must also sprinkle some in front of it.
Leviticus,16,16,That is how he will make the Most Holy Room pure. He must do it because the Israelites are not ‘clean.’ They have not obeyed me. They have also committed other sins. Aaron must do the same for the tent of meeting because it stands in the middle of the camp. And the camp is ‘unclean.’
Leviticus,16,17,"Aaron will go into the Most Holy Room to pay for the people’s sin. While Aaron is there, no one may be in the tent of meeting. No one may enter the tent until Aaron comes out. He will not come out until he has paid for his own sin and the sin of his whole family. He will not come out until he has also paid for the sin of the whole community of Israel."
Leviticus,16,18,“Then he will come out to the altar for burnt offerings. It is in front of the tent where the ark of the Lord is. He will make the altar pure and clean. He will take some of the bull’s blood and some of the goat’s blood. Then he will put the blood on all the horns that stick out from the upper four corners of the altar.
Leviticus,16,19,He will sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times. He will do it to make the altar pure. He will do it to set it apart from the Israelites. They are ‘unclean.’
Leviticus,16,20,“Aaron will finish making the Most Holy Room pure and ‘clean.’ He will finish making the tent of meeting and the altar pure. Then he will bring out the live goat.
Leviticus,16,21,"He must place both of his hands on its head. While he does that, he must tell me about all the sins the Israelites have committed. He must tell me about all their evil acts and the times they did not obey me. In that way he puts their sins on the goat’s head. Then he will send the goat away into the desert. The goat will be led away by a man appointed to do it."
Leviticus,16,22,The goat will carry all their sins on itself to a place where there are no people. And the man will set the goat free in the desert.
Leviticus,16,23,“Then Aaron must go into the tent of meeting. He must take off the linen clothes he put on before he entered the Most Holy Room. He must leave them there.
Leviticus,16,24,He must take a bath in the holy area. And he must put on his regular clothes. Then he will come out and sacrifice the burnt offering for himself. He will also sacrifice the burnt offering for the people. That will pay for his own sin and the people’s sin.
Leviticus,16,25,He will also burn the fat of the sin offering on the altar.
Leviticus,16,26,"“The man who sets free the goat that carries the people’s sins away must wash his clothes. He must take a bath. After that, he can come back into the camp."
Leviticus,16,27,"The bull and the goat for the sin offerings must be taken outside the camp. Their blood was brought into the Most Holy Room. It paid for sin. The hides, meat and guts of the animals must be burned up."
Leviticus,16,28,"The man who burns them must wash his clothes. He must take a bath. After that, he can come back into the camp."
Leviticus,16,29,“Here is a law for you that will last for all time to come. On the tenth day of the seventh month you must not eat anything. You must not do any work. It does not matter whether you are Israelites or outsiders.
Leviticus,16,30,On that day your sin will be paid for. You will be made pure and clean. You will be clean from all your sins in my sight.
Leviticus,16,31,That day is a sabbath for you. You must rest on it. You must not eat anything on that day. This is a law that will last for all time to come.
Leviticus,16,32,The high priest must pay for sin. He must make everything pure and clean. He has been anointed and prepared to become the next high priest after his father. He must put on the sacred clothes that are made out of linen.
Leviticus,16,33,"He must make the Most Holy Room, the tent of meeting and the altar pure. And he must pay for the sin of the priests and all the members of the community."
Leviticus,16,34,"“Here is a law for you that will last for all time to come. Once a year you must pay for all the sin of the Israelites.” So it was done, just as the Lord commanded Moses."
Leviticus,17,1,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Leviticus,17,2,"“Speak to Aaron and his sons. Speak to all the Israelites. Tell them, ‘Here is what the Lord has commanded. He has said,"
Leviticus,17,3,"“Suppose someone sacrifices an ox, a lamb or a goat. They sacrifice it in the camp or outside of it."
Leviticus,17,4,"They do it instead of bringing the animal to the entrance to the tent of meeting. They sacrifice it instead of giving it as an offering to me in front of my holy tent. Then they will be thought of as guilty of spilling blood. Because they have done that, they must be separated from their people."
Leviticus,17,5,The Israelites are now making sacrifices in the open fields. But they must bring their sacrifices to the priest. They must bring them to me at the entrance to the tent of meeting. There they must sacrifice them as friendship offerings.
Leviticus,17,6,The priest must splash the blood against my altar. It is the altar at the entrance to the tent of meeting. He must burn the fat. Its smell will please me.
Leviticus,17,7,"The Israelites must stop offering any of their sacrifices to statues of gods that look like goats. When they offer sacrifices to those statues, they are not faithful to me. This is a law for them that will last for all time to come.” ’"
Leviticus,17,8,"“Tell them, ‘Suppose someone offers a burnt offering or sacrifice. It does not matter whether they are an Israelite or an outsider."
Leviticus,17,9,And suppose they do not bring it to the entrance to the tent of meeting to sacrifice it to me. Then they must be separated from their people.
Leviticus,17,10,“ ‘Suppose someone eats meat that still has blood in it. It does not matter whether they are an Israelite or an outsider. I will turn against them if they eat it. I will separate them from their people.
Leviticus,17,11,The life of each creature is in its blood. So I have given you the blood of animals to pay for your sin on the altar. Blood is life. That is why blood pays for your sin.
Leviticus,17,12,"So I say to the Israelites, “You must not eat meat that still has blood in it. And an outsider who lives among you must not eat it either.”"
Leviticus,17,13,“ ‘Suppose any of you hunts any animal or bird that can be eaten. It does not matter whether you are an Israelite or an outsider. You must let the blood flow out of the animal or bird. You must cover the blood with dirt.
Leviticus,17,14,"That is because every creature’s life is its blood. And that is why I have said to the Israelites, “You must not eat any creature’s meat that still has blood in it. Every creature’s life is its blood. Anyone who eats that kind of meat must be separated from the community of Israel.”"
Leviticus,17,15,"“ ‘Suppose someone eats anything found dead or torn apart by wild animals. It does not matter whether they are an Israelite or an outsider. They must wash their clothes. They must take a bath. They will be “unclean” until evening. After that, they will be “clean.”"
Leviticus,17,16,But suppose they do not wash their clothes. And suppose they do not take a bath. Then they will be held responsible for what they have done.’ ”
Leviticus,18,1,"The Lord spoke to Moses. He said,"
Leviticus,18,2,"“Speak to the Israelites. Tell them, ‘I am the Lord your God."
Leviticus,18,3,Do not do what the people of Egypt do. You used to live there. And do not do what the people of Canaan do. I am bringing you into their land. Do not follow their practices.
Leviticus,18,4,Obey my laws. Be careful to follow my rules. I am the Lord your God.
Leviticus,18,5,Keep my rules and laws. The one who obeys them will benefit from living by them. I am the Lord.
Leviticus,18,6,“ ‘Do not have sex with any of your close relatives. I am the Lord.
Leviticus,18,7,“ ‘Do not bring shame on your father by having sex with your mother. Do not have sex with her. She is your mother.
Leviticus,18,8,“ ‘Do not have sex with any other wife of your father. That would bring shame on your father.
Leviticus,18,9,“ ‘Do not have sex with your sister. It does not matter whether she is your father’s daughter or your mother’s daughter. It does not matter whether she was born in the same home as you were or somewhere else.
Leviticus,18,10,“ ‘Do not have sex with your son’s daughter or your daughter’s daughter. That would bring shame on you.
Leviticus,18,11,“ ‘Do not have sex with the daughter of your father’s wife. She was born to your father. She is your sister.
Leviticus,18,12,“ ‘Do not have sex with your father’s sister. She is a close relative on your father’s side.

Leviticus,18,16,“ ‘Do not have sex with your brother’s wife. That would bring shame on your brother.
Leviticus,18,17,“ ‘Do not have sex with both a woman and her daughter. Do not have sex with either her son’s daughter or her daughter’s daughter. They are close relatives on her side. Having sex with them is an evil thing.
Leviticus,18,18,“ ‘Do not take your wife’s sister as another wife and have sex with her. Do not do it while your wife is still living.
Leviticus,18,19,“ ‘Do not have sex with a woman during her monthly period. She is “unclean” at that time.
Leviticus,18,20,“ ‘Do not have sex with your neighbor’s wife. That would make you “unclean.”
Leviticus,18,21,“ ‘Do not hand over any of your children to be sacrificed to the god Molek. That would be treating my name as if it were not holy. I am the Lord your God.
Leviticus,18,22,“ ‘Do not have sex with a man as you would have sex with a woman. I hate that.
Leviticus,18,23,“ ‘Do not have sex with an animal. Do not make yourself “unclean” by doing that. A woman must not offer herself to an animal to have sex with it. That is a wrong use of sex.
Leviticus,18,24,“ ‘Do not make yourselves “unclean” in any of these ways. That is how other nations became “unclean.” So I am going to drive those nations out of the land to make room for you.
Leviticus,18,25,Even their land was not “clean.” So I punished it because of its sin. The land itself threw out the people who lived there.
Leviticus,18,26,But you must keep my rules and my laws. You must not do any of the things I hate. It does not matter whether you are Israelites or outsiders.
Leviticus,18,27,All these things were done by the people who lived in the land before you. That is how the land became “unclean.”
Leviticus,18,28,"If you make the land “unclean,” it will throw you out. It will get rid of you just as it got rid of the nations there before you."
Leviticus,18,29,“ ‘Suppose you do any of the things I hate. Then you must be separated from your people.
Leviticus,18,30,"Do exactly what I require. When you arrive in Canaan, do not follow any of the practices of its people. I hate the things they do. Do not make yourselves “unclean” by doing them. I am the Lord your God.’ ”"
Leviticus,19,1,"The Lord spoke to Moses. He said,"
Leviticus,19,2,"“Speak to the whole community of Israel. Tell them, ‘Be holy, because I am holy. I am the Lord your God."

Leviticus,19,5,“ ‘Suppose you sacrifice a friendship offering to me. Then do it in the right way. And I will accept it from you.
Leviticus,19,6,You must eat it on the same day you sacrifice it or on the next day. Anything left over until the third day must be burned up.
Leviticus,19,7,"If you eat any of it on the third day, it is not pure. I will not accept it."
Leviticus,19,8,Whoever eats it will be held responsible. They have misused what is holy to me. They will be separated from their people.
Leviticus,19,9,“ ‘Suppose you are harvesting your crops. Then do not harvest all the way to the edges of your field. And do not pick up the grain you missed.
Leviticus,19,10,Do not go over your vineyard a second time. Do not pick up the grapes that have fallen to the ground. Leave them for poor people and outsiders. I am the Lord your God.
Leviticus,19,11,“ ‘Do not steal. “ ‘Do not tell lies. “ ‘Do not cheat one another.

Leviticus,19,13,“ ‘Do not cheat your neighbor. Do not rob him. “ ‘Do not hold back the pay of a hired worker until morning.
Leviticus,19,14,"“ ‘Do not ask for bad things to happen to deaf people. Do not put anything in front of blind people that will make them trip. Instead, have respect for me. I am the Lord your God."
Leviticus,19,15,"“ ‘Do not make something wrong appear to be right. Treat poor people and rich people in the same way. Do not favor one person over another. Instead, judge everyone fairly."
Leviticus,19,16,“ ‘Do not go around spreading lies among your people. “ ‘Do not do anything that puts your neighbor’s life in danger. I am the Lord.

Leviticus,19,20,"“ ‘Suppose a man sleeps with a female slave. But she and another man have promised to get married to each other. And her freedom has not yet been paid for or given to her. Then she and the man who slept with her must be punished. But they must not be put to death, because she had not been set free."
Leviticus,19,21,The man must bring a ram to the entrance to the tent of meeting. It is for a guilt offering to me.
Leviticus,19,22,The priest must take the ram for the guilt offering. He must sacrifice it to pay for the man’s sin in my sight. Then his sin will be forgiven.
Leviticus,19,23,"“ ‘When you enter the land, suppose you plant a fruit tree. Then do not eat its fruit for the first three years. The fruit is “unclean.”"
Leviticus,19,24,In the fourth year all the fruit will be holy. Offer it as a way of showing praise to me.
Leviticus,19,25,But in the fifth year you can eat the fruit. Then you will gather more and more fruit. I am the Lord your God.
Leviticus,19,26,“ ‘Do not eat any meat that still has blood in it. “ ‘Do not practice any kind of evil magic.
Leviticus,19,27,“ ‘Do not cut the hair on the sides of your head. Do not clip off the edges of your beard.

Leviticus,19,33,“ ‘Suppose an outsider lives with you in your land. Then do not treat them badly.
Leviticus,19,34,Treat them as if they were one of your own people. Love them as you love yourself. Remember that all of you were outsiders in Egypt. I am the Lord your God.
Leviticus,19,35,"“ ‘Be honest when you measure lengths, weights or amounts."
Leviticus,19,36,Use honest scales and honest weights. Use honest dry measures. And use honest liquid measures. I am the Lord your God. I brought you out of Egypt.

Leviticus,20,1,"The Lord spoke to Moses. He said,"
Leviticus,20,2,"“Say to the Israelites, ‘Suppose a person sacrifices one of his children to the god Molek. It does not matter whether that person is an Israelite or an outsider who lives in Israel. He must be put to death. The members of the community must kill him by throwing stones at him."
Leviticus,20,3,I will turn against that man. I will separate him from his people. That’s because he has sacrificed his child to Molek. He has made my sacred tent “unclean.” He has treated my name as if it were not holy.
Leviticus,20,4,Suppose the members of the community act like they don’t know that the man has sacrificed his child to Molek. And suppose they don’t put him to death.
Leviticus,20,5,Then I will turn against that man and his family. I will separate them from their people. I will also separate all those who follow him by joining themselves to Molek. They are not faithful to me.
Leviticus,20,6,“ ‘Suppose someone looks for advice from people who get messages from those who have died. Or they go to people who talk to the spirits of the dead. And they do what those people say. Then they have not been faithful to me. So I will turn against them. I will separate them from their people.
Leviticus,20,7,"“ ‘Set yourselves apart for me. Be holy, because I am the Lord your God."
Leviticus,20,8,Obey my rules. Follow them. I am the Lord . I make you holy.
Leviticus,20,9,“ ‘Anyone who asks for bad things to happen to their father or mother must be put to death. They have cursed their father or mother. So anything that happens to them will be their own fault.

Leviticus,20,11,“ ‘Suppose a man has sex with his father’s wife. Then he has brought shame on his father. The man and the woman must be put to death. Anything that happens to them will be their own fault.
Leviticus,20,12,“ ‘Suppose a man has sex with his daughter-in-law. Then they must be put to death. They have used sex in the wrong way. Anything that happens to them will be their own fault.
Leviticus,20,13,“ ‘Suppose a man has sex with another man as he would have sex with a woman. I hate what they have done. They must be put to death. Anything that happens to them will be their own fault.
Leviticus,20,14,“ ‘Suppose a man gets married to both a woman and her mother. That is evil. All of them must be burned to death. Then there will not be any evil among you.
Leviticus,20,15,“ ‘Suppose a man has sex with an animal. Then he must be put to death. You must also kill the animal.
Leviticus,20,16,“ ‘Suppose a woman has sex with an animal. Then kill the woman and the animal. They must be put to death. Anything that happens to them will be their own fault.
Leviticus,20,17,“ ‘Suppose a man gets married to his sister and has sex with her. That is a shameful thing to do. It does not matter whether she is the daughter of his father or of his mother. They must be separated from their community in front of everyone. That man has brought shame on his sister. He will be responsible for what he has done.
Leviticus,20,18,“ ‘Suppose a man has sex with a woman during her monthly period. He has uncovered the place where her bleeding was coming from. And she has let him do it. So both of them must be separated from their people.
Leviticus,20,19,“ ‘Do not have sex with the sister of either your mother or your father. That would bring shame on a close relative. Both of you would be held responsible for what you have done.
Leviticus,20,20,“ ‘Suppose a man has sex with his aunt. Then he has brought shame on his uncle. Both of them will be held accountable for what they have done. They will die without having any children.
Leviticus,20,21,“ ‘Suppose a man gets married to his brother’s wife. That is something that should never be done. He has brought shame on his brother. Neither of them will have any children.
Leviticus,20,22,“ ‘Obey all my rules and laws. Follow them. Then the land where I am bringing you to live will not throw you out.
Leviticus,20,23,"To make room for you, I am going to drive out the nations that are in the land. You must not follow the practices of those nations. I hated those nations because they did all those things."
Leviticus,20,24,"But I said to you, “You will take over their land as your own. I will give it to you. It will belong to you. It is a land that has plenty of milk and honey.” I am the Lord your God. I have set you apart from the other nations."
Leviticus,20,25,“ ‘So you must be able to tell the difference between animals that are “clean” and those that are not. You must know which birds are “clean” and which are not. Do not make yourselves “unclean” by eating any “unclean” animal or bird. Do not make yourselves “unclean” by eating anything that moves along the ground. I have set all of them apart as “unclean” for you.
Leviticus,20,26,You must be holy. You must be set apart to me. I am the Lord . I am holy. I have set you apart from the other nations to be my own people.
Leviticus,20,27,“ ‘Suppose a man or woman gets messages from those who have died. Or suppose a man or woman talks to the spirits of the dead. Then you must put that man or woman to death. You must kill them by throwing stones at them. Anything that happens to them will be their own fault.’ ”
Leviticus,21,1,"The Lord said to Moses, “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron. Tell them, ‘A priest must not make himself “unclean” by going near the dead body of any of his people."
Leviticus,21,2,"But he can go near the body of a close relative. It could be his mother, father, son, daughter or brother."
Leviticus,21,3,He can also go near a sister who is not married. She would have depended on him because she did not have a husband. The priest can make himself “unclean” by going near her body.
Leviticus,21,4,But he must not make himself “unclean” by going near the bodies of people only related to him by marriage. Going near them would make him “unclean.”
Leviticus,21,5,“ ‘Priests must not shave any part of their heads. They must not shave off the edges of their beards. They must not make cuts on their bodies when someone dies.
Leviticus,21,6,Priests must be holy. They must be set apart for me. I am their God. They must not treat my name as if it were not holy. They must be holy because they bring food offerings to me. That is my food.
Leviticus,21,7,“ ‘They must not get married to women who are “unclean” because they are prostitutes. They must not marry women who are divorced from their husbands. That is because priests are holy. They are set apart for me. I am their God.
Leviticus,21,8,"Consider them as holy, because they offer up food to me. Consider them as holy, because I am holy. I am the Lord . I make you holy."
Leviticus,21,9,“ ‘Suppose a priest’s daughter makes herself “unclean” by becoming a prostitute. Then she brings shame on her father. She must be burned to death.
Leviticus,21,10,"“ ‘The high priest is the one among his brothers whose head has been anointed with olive oil. He has been appointed to wear the priest’s clothes. When someone dies, the high priest must not let his own hair hang loose. He must not tear his clothes to show how sad he is."
Leviticus,21,11,"He must not enter a place where there is a dead body. He must not make himself “unclean,” even if his father or mother dies."
Leviticus,21,12,He must not leave the sacred tent of the Lord to take part in burying a body. That would bring shame on the tent. The anointing oil has set the high priest apart. I am the Lord.
Leviticus,21,13,“ ‘The woman the high priest gets married to must be a virgin.
Leviticus,21,14,He must not marry a widow or a woman who is divorced. He must not marry a woman who is “unclean” because she is a prostitute. He must only marry a virgin. She must come from his own people.
Leviticus,21,15,"If he doesn’t marry a virgin, he makes the children he has by her “unclean.” I am the Lord . I make him holy.’ ”"
Leviticus,21,16,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Leviticus,21,17,"“Speak to Aaron. Tell him, ‘No man in your family line with any flaws may come near to offer food to the Lord . This is true for all time to come."
Leviticus,21,18,No man who has any flaws can come near. No man who is blind or disabled can come. No man whose body is scarred or twisted can come.
Leviticus,21,19,No man whose foot or hand is disabled can come.
Leviticus,21,20,No man whose back is bent can come. No man who is too short can come. No man who has anything wrong with his eyes can come. No man who has boils or running sores can come. No man whose sex glands are crushed can come.
Leviticus,21,21,"No man with any flaws who is in the family line of Aaron the priest may come near me. He can’t come to bring the food offerings to the Lord . If he has any flaws, he must not come near to offer food to the Lord."
Leviticus,21,22,He can eat the holy food. He can also eat my very holy food.
Leviticus,21,23,"But because he has a flaw, he must not go near the curtain or approach the altar. If he does, he will make my sacred tent “unclean.” I am the Lord . I make everything holy.’ ”"
Leviticus,21,24,So Moses told all these things to Aaron and his sons. He also told them to all the Israelites.
Leviticus,22,1,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Leviticus,22,2,“Here is what I want you to tell Aaron and his sons. Tell them to treat the sacred offerings with respect. They are the offerings the Israelites set apart to honor me. So Aaron and his sons must never treat my name as if it were not holy. I am the Lord.
Leviticus,22,3,"“Say to them, ‘Suppose a man in your family line is “unclean.” And suppose he comes near the sacred offerings. They are the offerings the Israelites set apart to honor me. That man must not be allowed to serve me as a priest. That applies for all time to come. I am the Lord."
Leviticus,22,4,“ ‘Suppose a man in Aaron’s family line has a skin disease. Or suppose liquid waste is flowing out of his body. Then he can’t eat the sacred offerings until he is made pure and clean. Suppose he touches something made “unclean” by coming near a dead body. Or suppose he touches someone who has semen flowing from his body. Then he will be “unclean.”
Leviticus,22,5,Or suppose he touches any crawling thing that makes him “unclean.” Or suppose he touches any person who makes him “unclean.” It does not matter what “unclean” thing he touches. It will make him “unclean.”
Leviticus,22,6,The one who touches anything of that kind will be “unclean” until evening. He must not eat any of the sacred offerings unless he has taken a bath.
Leviticus,22,7,"When the sun goes down, he will be “clean.” After that, he can eat the sacred offerings. They are his food."
Leviticus,22,8,"He must not eat anything found dead or torn apart by wild animals. If he does, it will make him “unclean.” I am the Lord."
Leviticus,22,9,“ ‘The priests must do what I require. But suppose they make fun of what I require. Then they will become guilty and die. I am the Lord . I make them holy.
Leviticus,22,10,“ ‘Only a member of a priest’s family can eat the sacred offering. The guest of a priest can’t eat it. A priest’s hired worker can’t eat it either.
Leviticus,22,11,But suppose a priest buys a slave with money. Or suppose slaves are born in his house. Then they can eat the sacred food.
Leviticus,22,12,Suppose a priest’s daughter marries someone who is not a priest. Then she can’t eat any of the food brought as a sacred gift.
Leviticus,22,13,"But suppose the priest’s daughter becomes a widow or is divorced. She does not have any children. And she returns to live in her father’s house, where she lived when she was young. Then she can eat her father’s food. But a person who does not belong to a priest’s family can’t eat any of it."
Leviticus,22,14,“ ‘Suppose someone eats a sacred offering by mistake. Then they must pay back the priest for the offering. They must also add a fifth of its value to it.
Leviticus,22,15,The priests must not allow the sacred offerings to become “unclean.” They are the offerings the Israelites bring to the Lord.
Leviticus,22,16,"The priests must not allow the offerings to become “unclean” by letting the people eat them. If they do, they will bring guilt on the people. They will have to pay for what they have done. I am the Lord . I make them holy.’ ”"
Leviticus,22,17,"The Lord spoke to Moses. He said,"
Leviticus,22,18,"“Speak to Aaron and his sons. Speak to all the Israelites. Tell them, ‘Suppose any of you brings a gift for a burnt offering to the Lord . It does not matter whether you are an Israelite or an outsider who lives in Israel. It does not matter whether you bring the offering to keep a promise or because you choose to give it."
Leviticus,22,19,"You must bring a male animal without any flaws if you want the Lord to accept it from you. It does not matter whether it is from your cattle, sheep or goats."
Leviticus,22,20,"Do not bring an animal that has any flaws. If you do, the Lord will not accept it from you."
Leviticus,22,21,"Suppose any of you brings an animal for a friendship offering to the Lord . Then it must not have any flaws at all. If it does, the Lord will not accept it. It does not matter whether the animal is from your herd or flock. It does not matter whether you bring it to keep a promise or because you choose to give it."
Leviticus,22,22,Do not offer a blind animal to the Lord . Do not bring a hurt or wounded animal. And do not offer one that has warts or boils or running sores. Do not place any of them on the altar as a food offering presented to the Lord.
Leviticus,22,23,But suppose you bring an offering you choose to give. Then you can bring an ox or a sheep whose body is twisted or too small. But the Lord will not accept it if you offer it to keep a promise.
Leviticus,22,24,"You must not offer the Lord a male animal whose sex glands have been hurt. The glands also must not be crushed, torn or cut. You must not offer that kind of animal in your own land."
Leviticus,22,25,And you must not accept that kind of animal from someone who comes from another land. You must not offer it as food for your God. He will not accept it from you. Its body is twisted and has flaws.’ ”
Leviticus,22,26,"The Lord spoke to Moses. He said,"
Leviticus,22,27,"“When a calf, lamb or goat is born, it must remain with its mother for seven days. From the eighth day on, I will accept it as a food offering presented to me."
Leviticus,22,28,Do not kill a cow and its calf on the same day. Do not kill a female sheep and its lamb on the same day.
Leviticus,22,29,“Sacrifice a thank offering to me in the right way. Then I will accept it from you.
Leviticus,22,30,You must eat it that same day. Do not leave any of it until morning. I am the Lord.
Leviticus,22,31,“Obey my commands. Follow them. I am the Lord.
Leviticus,22,32,Do not treat my name as if it were not holy. The Israelites must recognize me as the holy God. I am the Lord . I made you holy.
Leviticus,22,33,I brought you out of Egypt to be your God. I am the Lord .”
Leviticus,23,1,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Leviticus,23,2,"“Speak to the Israelites. Tell them, ‘Here are my appointed feast days. They are the appointed feast days of the Lord . Tell the people that they must come together for these sacred assemblies."
Leviticus,23,3,"“ ‘There are six days when you can work. But the seventh day is a day of sabbath rest. You must rest on it. Come together on that sacred day. You must not do any work on it. No matter where you live, it is a Sabbath day to honor the Lord."
Leviticus,23,4,“ ‘Here are the Lord ’s appointed feasts. Tell the people that they must come together for these sacred gatherings at their appointed times.
Leviticus,23,5,The Lord ’s Passover begins when the sun goes down on the 14th day of the first month.
Leviticus,23,6,The Lord ’s Feast of Unleavened Bread begins on the 15th day of that month. For seven days you must eat bread made without yeast.
Leviticus,23,7,On the first day you must come together for a special service. Do not do any regular work on that day.
Leviticus,23,8,On each of the seven days bring a food offering to the Lord . On the seventh day come together for a special service. Do not do any regular work on that day.’ ”
Leviticus,23,9,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Leviticus,23,10,"“Speak to the Israelites. Tell them, ‘When you enter the land I am going to give you, bring an offering to the Lord . Gather your crops. Bring the first bundle of grain to the priest."
Leviticus,23,11,He must lift up the grain and wave it in front of the Lord . Then the Lord will accept it from you. The priest must wave it on the day after the Sabbath.
Leviticus,23,12,"On the day he waves the grain for you, you must sacrifice a burnt offering to me. It must be a lamb that does not have any flaws. It must be a year old."
Leviticus,23,13,You must bring it together with its grain offering. The grain offering must be seven pounds of the finest flour. Mix it with olive oil. It is a food offering presented to the Lord . It has a pleasant smell. You must offer a drink offering along with the burnt offering. It must be a quart of wine.
Leviticus,23,14,You must not eat any bread until the day you bring your offering to the Lord your God. You must not eat any cooked grain or any of your first grain until that time. This is a law that will last for all time to come. It applies no matter where you live.
Leviticus,23,15,“ ‘The day you brought the grain for the wave offering was the day after the Sabbath. Count off seven full weeks from that day.
Leviticus,23,16,Count off 50 days up to the day after the seventh Sabbath. On that day bring to the Lord an offering of your first grain.
Leviticus,23,17,Bring two loaves of bread that are made with seven pounds of the finest flour. They must be baked with yeast. Bring them to me as a wave offering from the first share of your crops. That applies no matter where you live.
Leviticus,23,18,"Together with the bread, bring seven male lambs. Each lamb must be a year old. It must not have any flaws. Also bring one young bull and two rams. They will be a burnt offering to the Lord . They will be offered together with their grain offerings and drink offerings. They are food offerings. Their smell pleases the Lord."
Leviticus,23,19,Then sacrifice one male goat for a sin offering. Also sacrifice two lambs for a friendship offering. Each of the lambs must be a year old.
Leviticus,23,20,The priest must lift up the two lambs and wave them in front of me as a wave offering. He must offer them together with the bread made out of the first share of your crops. They are a sacred offering to the Lord . They will be given to the priest.
Leviticus,23,21,On that same day tell the people that they must come together for a special worship service. They must not do any regular work. That is a law that will last for all time to come. It applies no matter where you live.
Leviticus,23,22,“ ‘Suppose you are gathering your crops. Then do not harvest all the way to the edges of your field. And do not pick up the grain you missed. Leave some for the poor people and the outsiders who live among you. I am the Lord your God.’ ”
Leviticus,23,23,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Leviticus,23,24,"“Say to the Israelites, ‘On the first day of the seventh month you must have a day of sabbath rest. It must be a special service announced with trumpet blasts."
Leviticus,23,25,"Do not do any regular work on that day. Instead, bring a food offering to the Lord .’ ”"
Leviticus,23,26,"The Lord spoke to Moses. He said,"
Leviticus,23,27,“The tenth day of the seventh month is the day when sin is paid for. Come together for a special service. Do not eat any food. Bring a food offering to the Lord.
Leviticus,23,28,Do not do any work on that day. It is the day when sin is paid for. On that day your sin will be paid for in my sight. I am the Lord your God.
Leviticus,23,29,Suppose you do eat food on that day. Then you will be separated from your people.
Leviticus,23,30,I will destroy anyone among your people who does any work on that day.
Leviticus,23,31,You must not do any work at all. This is a law that will last for all time to come. It applies no matter where you live.
Leviticus,23,32,That day is a day of sabbath rest for you. You must rest on it. You must not eat anything on that day. You must follow the rules of the sabbath rest. Follow them from the evening of the ninth day of the month until the following evening.”
Leviticus,23,33,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Leviticus,23,34,"“Say to the Israelites, ‘On the 15th day of the seventh month the Lord ’s Feast of Booths begins. It lasts for seven days."
Leviticus,23,35,On the first day you must come together for a special service. Do not do any regular work on that day.
Leviticus,23,36,On each of the seven days bring a food offering to the Lord . On the eighth day come together for a special service. Bring a food offering to the Lord . That special service is the closing service. Do not do any regular work on that day.
Leviticus,23,37,"“ ‘These are the Lord ’s appointed feasts. Tell the people that they must come together for these sacred assemblies. During those times, the people must bring food offerings to the Lord . They are burnt offerings and grain offerings. They are sacrifices and drink offerings. Each offering must be brought at its required time."
Leviticus,23,38,The offerings are in addition to those of the days of sabbath rest. The offerings are also in addition to your gifts and anything you have promised. They are also in addition to all the offerings you choose to give to the Lord.
Leviticus,23,39,“ ‘Begin with the 15th day of the seventh month. That is after you have gathered your crops. On that day celebrate the Lord ’s Feast of Booths for seven days. The first day is a day of rest. The eighth day is also a day of rest.
Leviticus,23,40,"On the first day you must get branches from palms, willows and other leafy trees. You must be filled with joy in front of the Lord your God for seven days."
Leviticus,23,41,Celebrate the Lord ’s Feast of Booths for seven days each year. This is a law that will last for all time to come. Celebrate the feast in the seventh month.
Leviticus,23,42,Live in booths for seven days. All the Israelites must live in booths.
Leviticus,23,43,Then your children after you will know that I made the Israelites live in booths. I made them do it after I brought them out of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.’ ”
Leviticus,23,44,So Moses announced to the Israelites the appointed feasts of the Lord.
Leviticus,24,1,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Leviticus,24,2,“Command the Israelites to bring you clear oil made from pressed olives. Use it to keep the lamps burning and giving light all the time.
Leviticus,24,3,Aaron must take care of the lamps in front of the Lord from evening until morning all the time. This is a law that will last for all time to come. The lamps are outside the curtain in front of the tablets of the covenant law in the tent of meeting.
Leviticus,24,4,The lamps are on the pure gold lampstand in front of the Lord . They must be taken care of all the time.
Leviticus,24,5,“Get the finest flour and bake 12 loaves of bread. Use seven pounds of flour for each loaf.
Leviticus,24,6,Arrange them in two stacks. Put six loaves in each stack on the table made out of pure gold. The table stands in front of the Lord.
Leviticus,24,7,By each stack put some pure incense. It will remind you that all good things come from the Lord . Burn the incense in place of the bread. The incense is a food offering presented to the Lord.
Leviticus,24,8,The bread must be set out in front of the Lord regularly. Do it every Sabbath day. It will be Israel’s duty to provide it for all time to come.
Leviticus,24,9,The bread belongs to Aaron and his sons. They must eat it in the holy area. It is a very holy part of their regular share of the food offerings presented to the Lord .”
Leviticus,24,10,There was a man who had an Israelite mother. His father was born in Egypt. The man went out among the Israelites. A fight broke out in the camp between him and an Israelite.
Leviticus,24,11,The son of the Israelite woman spoke evil things against the Lord by using a curse. So the people brought him to Moses. The name of the man’s mother was Shelomith. She was the daughter of Dibri. Dibri was from the tribe of Dan.
Leviticus,24,12,The people kept her son under guard until they could find out what the Lord wanted them to do.
Leviticus,24,13,"Then the Lord spoke to Moses. He said,"
Leviticus,24,14,“Get the man who spoke evil things against the Lord . Take him outside the camp. All those who heard him say those things must place their hands on his head. Then the whole community must kill him by throwing stones at him.
Leviticus,24,15,"Say to the Israelites, ‘Anyone who curses me will be held accountable."
Leviticus,24,16,"Anyone who speaks evil things against my Name must be put to death. The whole community must kill them by throwing stones at them. It does not matter whether they are an outsider or an Israelite. When they speak evil things against my Name, they must be put to death."
Leviticus,24,17,“ ‘Anyone who kills another human being must be put to death.
Leviticus,24,18,Anyone who kills someone’s animal must pay its owner. A life must be taken for a life.
Leviticus,24,19,Suppose someone hurts their neighbor. Then what they have done must be done to them.
Leviticus,24,20,A bone must be broken for a bone. An eye must be put out for an eye. A tooth must be knocked out for a tooth. The one who has hurt his neighbor must be hurt in the same way.
Leviticus,24,21,"Whoever kills an animal must pay its owner. But if they kill a human being, they must be put to death."
Leviticus,24,22,The same law applies whether they are an outsider or an Israelite. I am the Lord your God.’ ”
Leviticus,24,23,Then Moses spoke to the Israelites. They got the man who had spoken evil things against the Lord . They took him outside the camp. There they killed him by throwing stones at him. The Israelites did just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
Leviticus,25,1,"The Lord spoke to Moses at Mount Sinai. He said,"
Leviticus,25,2,"“Speak to the Israelites. Tell them, ‘You will enter the land I am going to give you. When you do, you must honor the Lord every seventh year by not farming the land that year."
Leviticus,25,3,For six years plant your fields. Trim the branches in your vineyards and gather your crops.
Leviticus,25,4,But the seventh year must be a year of sabbath rest for the land. The land must rest during it. It is a sabbath year to honor the Lord . Do not plant your fields. Do not trim the branches in your vineyards.
Leviticus,25,5,Do not gather what grows without being planted. And do not gather the grapes from the vines you have not taken care of. The land must have a year of rest.
Leviticus,25,6,Anything the land produces during the sabbath year will be food for you. It will be for you and your male and female servants. Your hired workers will eat it. So will people who live with you for a while.
Leviticus,25,7,And so will your livestock and the wild animals that are in your land. Anything the land produces can be eaten.
Leviticus,25,8,“ ‘Count off seven sabbath years. Count off seven times seven years. The seven sabbath years add up to a total of 49 years.
Leviticus,25,9,The tenth day of the seventh month is the day when sin is paid for. On that day blow the trumpet all through your land.
Leviticus,25,10,Set the 50th year apart. Announce freedom all over the land to everyone who lives there. The 50th year will be a Year of Jubilee for you. Each of you must return to your own family property. And each of you must return to your own tribe.
Leviticus,25,11,The 50th year will be a Year of Jubilee for you. Do not plant anything. Do not gather what grows without being planted. And do not gather the grapes from the vines you have not taken care of.
Leviticus,25,12,It is a Year of Jubilee. It will be holy for you. Eat only what the fields produce.
Leviticus,25,13,“ ‘In the Year of Jubilee all of you must return to your own property.
Leviticus,25,14,“ ‘Suppose you sell land to any of your own people. Or you buy land from them. Then do not take advantage of each other.
Leviticus,25,15,The price you pay must be based on the number of years since the last Year of Jubilee. Here is how the price you charge must be decided. It must be based on the number of years left for gathering crops before the next Year of Jubilee.
Leviticus,25,16,"When there are many years left, you must raise the price. When there are only a few years left, you must lower the price. That is because what is really being sold to you is the number of crops the land will produce."
Leviticus,25,17,"Do not take advantage of each other. Instead, have respect for your God. I am the Lord your God."
Leviticus,25,18,“ ‘Follow my rules. Be careful to obey my laws. Then you will live safely in the land.
Leviticus,25,19,The land will produce its fruit. You will eat as much as you want. And you will live there in safety.
Leviticus,25,20,"Suppose you say, “In the seventh year we will not plant anything or gather our crops. So what will we eat?”"
Leviticus,25,21,I will send you a great blessing in the sixth year. The land will produce enough for three years.
Leviticus,25,22,"While you plant during the eighth year, you will eat food from the old crop. You will continue to eat food from it until the crops from the ninth year are gathered."
Leviticus,25,23,“ ‘The land must not be sold without a way of getting it back. That is because it belongs to me. You are only outsiders and strangers in my land.
Leviticus,25,24,You must make sure that you can buy the land back. That applies to all the land that belongs to you.
Leviticus,25,25,“ ‘Suppose one of your own people becomes poor. And suppose they have to sell some of their land. Then their nearest relative must come and buy back what they have sold.
Leviticus,25,26,But suppose they do not have anyone to buy it back for them. And suppose things go well for them and they earn enough money to buy it back themselves.
Leviticus,25,27,Then they must decide how much the crops have become worth since the time they sold the land. They must take that amount off the price the land was sold for. They must give the one selling it back to them the money that is left. Then they can go back to their own property.
Leviticus,25,28,But suppose they have not earned enough money to pay them back. Then the buyer they sold the land to will keep it until the Year of Jubilee. At that time it will be returned to them. Then they can go back to their property.
Leviticus,25,29,“ ‘Suppose someone sells a house in a city that has a wall around it. Then for a full year after they sell it they have the right to buy it back.
Leviticus,25,30,But suppose they do not buy it back before the full year has passed. Then the house in the walled city will continue to belong to the buyer and the buyer’s children. It will not be returned to the seller in the Year of Jubilee.
Leviticus,25,31,But houses in villages that do not have walls around them must be treated like property outside walled cities. Those houses can be bought back at any time. And they must be returned in the Year of Jubilee.
Leviticus,25,32,“ ‘The Levites always have the right to buy back their houses in the towns that belong to them.
Leviticus,25,33,So their property among the Israelites can be bought back. That applies to a house sold in any of their towns. Any house that is sold must be returned to its original owner in the Year of Jubilee. That is because the houses of the Levites will always belong to them.
Leviticus,25,34,But the grasslands around their towns must never be sold. They will belong to them for all time to come.
Leviticus,25,35,"“ ‘Suppose any of your own people become poor. And suppose they can’t take care of themselves. Then help them just as you would help an outsider or a stranger. In that way, the poor can continue to live among you."
Leviticus,25,36,"Do not charge them interest of any kind. Instead, have respect for God. Then those who have become poor can continue to live among you."
Leviticus,25,37,"If you lend them money, you must not charge them interest. And you must not sell them food for more than it cost you."
Leviticus,25,38,I am the Lord your God. I brought you out of Egypt. I did it to give you the land of Canaan. I wanted to be your God.
Leviticus,25,39,“ ‘Suppose any of your own people become poor. And suppose they sell themselves to you. Then do not make them work as slaves.
Leviticus,25,40,You must treat them like hired workers. Or you must treat them like those living among you for a while. They must work for you until the Year of Jubilee.
Leviticus,25,41,Then they and their children must be set free. They will go back to their own tribes. They will go back to the property their people have always owned.
Leviticus,25,42,The Israelites are my servants. I brought them out of Egypt. So they must not be sold as slaves.
Leviticus,25,43,Show them pity when you rule over them. Have respect for God.
Leviticus,25,44,“ ‘You must get your male and female slaves from the nations that are around you. You can buy slaves from them.
Leviticus,25,45,You can also buy as slaves some of the people living among you for a while. You can also buy members of their families born among you. They will become your property.
Leviticus,25,46,"You can leave them to your children as their share of your property. You can make them slaves for life. But when you rule over your own people, you must be kind to them."
Leviticus,25,47,“ ‘Suppose an outsider living among you for a while becomes rich. Then suppose any of your own people become poor. Then they sell themselves to the outsider living among you. Or they sell themselves to a member of the outsider’s family.
Leviticus,25,48,Then they keep the right to buy themselves back after they have sold themselves. One of their relatives can buy them back.
Leviticus,25,49,"An uncle or a cousin can buy them back after they have sold themselves. In fact, any relative in their tribe can do it. Or suppose things go well for them. Then they can buy themselves back."
Leviticus,25,50,They and their buyer must count the number of years from the time of the sale up to the Year of Jubilee. The price for their freedom must be based on the amount paid to a hired man for that number of years.
Leviticus,25,51,Suppose there are many years until the Year of Jubilee. Then for their freedom they must pay a larger share of the price paid for them.
Leviticus,25,52,But suppose there are only a few years left until the Year of Jubilee. Then they must count the number of years that are left. The payment for their freedom must be based on that number.
Leviticus,25,53,They must be treated as workers hired from year to year. You must make sure that those they must work for are kind to them when they rule over them.
Leviticus,25,54,“ ‘Suppose they are not bought back in any of those ways. Then they and their children must still be set free in the Year of Jubilee.
Leviticus,25,55,That’s because the Israelites belong to me. They are my servants. I brought them out of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.
Leviticus,26,1,“ ‘Do not make statues of gods for yourselves. Do not set up a likeness of a god or a sacred stone for yourselves. Do not place a carved stone in your land and bow down in front of it. I am the Lord your God.
Leviticus,26,2,“ ‘You must always keep my Sabbath days. Have respect for my sacred tent. I am the Lord.
Leviticus,26,3,“ ‘Follow my rules. Be careful to obey my commands.
Leviticus,26,4,Then I will send you rain at the right time. The ground will produce its crops. The trees will bear their fruit.
Leviticus,26,5,You will continue to harvest your grain until you gather your grapes. You will continue to gather your grapes until you plant your crops. You will have all you want to eat. And you will live in safety in your land.
Leviticus,26,6,“ ‘I will give you peace in the land. You will be able to sleep because no one will make you afraid. I will remove wild animals from the land. There will not be any war in your country.
Leviticus,26,7,You will hunt down your enemies. You will kill them with your swords.
Leviticus,26,8,"Five of you will chase 100. And 100 of you will chase 10,000. You will kill your enemies with your swords."
Leviticus,26,9,“ ‘I will bless you. I will give you many children so that there will be many of you. And I will be faithful to the covenant I made with you.
Leviticus,26,10,You will still be eating last year’s crops when you will have to make room for new crops.
Leviticus,26,11,I will live among you. I will not turn away from you.
Leviticus,26,12,I will walk among you. I will be your God. And you will be my people.
Leviticus,26,13,I am the Lord your God. I brought you out of Egypt. I did not want you to be slaves in Egypt anymore. I threw off your heavy load. I helped you walk with your heads held high.
Leviticus,26,14,"“ ‘On the other hand, suppose you do not listen to me. Suppose you do not carry out all my commands."
Leviticus,26,15,Suppose you say no to my rules and turn away from my laws. And suppose you break my covenant by failing to carry out all my commands.
Leviticus,26,16,"Then here is what I will do to you. All at once I will bring terror on you. I will send sicknesses that will make you weak. I will send fever that will destroy your sight. It will slowly take your strength away. When you plant seeds, it will not do you any good. Instead, your enemies will eat what you have planted."
Leviticus,26,17,I will turn against you. Then your enemies will win the battle over you. Those who hate you will rule over you. You will run away even when no one is chasing you.
Leviticus,26,18,"“ ‘After all that, suppose you still will not listen to me. Then I will punish you for your sins seven times."
Leviticus,26,19,"I will break down your stubborn pride. I will make the sky above you like iron, and it will not rain. I will make the ground under you like bronze, and you will not be able to farm it."
Leviticus,26,20,"You will work with all your strength, but it will not do you any good. That is because your soil will not produce any crops. The trees of your land will not bear any fruit."
Leviticus,26,21,“ ‘Suppose you continue to be my enemy. And suppose you still refuse to listen to me. Then I will multiply your troubles many times because of your sins.
Leviticus,26,22,I will send wild animals against you. They will kill your children. They will destroy your cattle. There will be so few of you left that your roads will be deserted.
Leviticus,26,23,"“ ‘After all those things, suppose you still do not accept my warnings. And suppose you continue to be my enemy."
Leviticus,26,24,Then I myself will be your enemy. I will make you suffer again and again for your sins.
Leviticus,26,25,"I will send war against you to punish you for breaking my covenant. When you go back into your cities, I will send a plague among you. You will be handed over to your enemies."
Leviticus,26,26,"I will cut off your supply of bread. Ten women will need only one oven to bake your bread. They will weigh out the bread piece by piece. Even when you eat all of it, it will not be enough to satisfy you."
Leviticus,26,27,"“ ‘After all that, suppose you still do not listen to me. And suppose you continue to be my enemy."
Leviticus,26,28,Then I will be angry with you. I will be your enemy. I myself will again punish you for your sins over and over.
Leviticus,26,29,You will eat the dead bodies of your sons. You will also eat the dead bodies of your daughters.
Leviticus,26,30,I will destroy the high places where you worship other gods. I will pull down your incense altars. I will pile up your dead bodies on the lifeless statues of your gods. And I will turn away from you.
Leviticus,26,31,I will completely destroy your cities. I will destroy your places of worship. The pleasant smell of your offerings will not give me any delight.
Leviticus,26,32,I myself will destroy your land so completely that your enemies who live there will be shocked.
Leviticus,26,33,I will scatter you among the nations. I will pull out my sword and hunt you down. Your land and your cities will be completely destroyed.
Leviticus,26,34,Then the deserted land will enjoy its sabbath years. It will rest. It will not be farmed. It will enjoy its sabbaths. But you will become prisoners in the country of your enemies.
Leviticus,26,35,The land will rest the whole time it is deserted. It was not able to rest during the sabbaths you lived in it.
Leviticus,26,36,"“ ‘Some of you will be left in the lands of your enemies. I will fill your hearts with fear. The sound of a leaf blown by the wind will scare you away. You will run as if you were escaping from swords. You will fall down, even though no one is chasing you."
Leviticus,26,37,"You will trip over one another as if you were running away from the battle. You will run away, even though no one is chasing you. You will not be able to stand and fight against your enemies."
Leviticus,26,38,"While you are still scattered among the nations, you will die. The lands of your enemies will destroy you."
Leviticus,26,39,You who are left in those lands will become weaker and weaker. You will die because of your sins and the sins of your people who lived before you.
Leviticus,26,40,“ ‘But suppose you admit that both you and your people who lived before you have sinned. You admit the evil and dishonest things you have done against me. And you admit you have become my enemy.
Leviticus,26,41,What you did made me become your enemy. I let your enemies take you into their land. But suppose you stop being stubborn. You stop being proud. And you pay for your sin.
Leviticus,26,42,Then I will remember my covenant with Jacob. I will remember my covenant with Isaac. I will remember my covenant with Abraham. I will remember what I said to them about the land.
Leviticus,26,43,You will leave the land. It will enjoy its sabbaths while it lies deserted because you are not there. You will pay for your sins because you said no to my laws. You turned away from my rules.
Leviticus,26,44,"But even after all that, I will not say no to you or turn away from you. I will not destroy you completely in the land of your enemies. I will not break my covenant with you. I am the Lord your God."
Leviticus,26,45,"Because of you, I will remember the covenant I made with the people of Israel who lived before you. I brought them out of Egypt to be their God. The nations saw me do it. I am the Lord .’ ”"
Leviticus,26,46,"These are the orders, the laws and the rules of the covenant the Lord made on Mount Sinai. He made it between himself and the Israelites through Moses."
Leviticus,27,1,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Leviticus,27,2,"“Speak to the Israelites. Tell them, ‘Suppose someone makes a special promise to set a person apart to serve the Lord . Here is how much it will cost to set that person free from the promise to serve."
Leviticus,27,3,The cost for a male between the ages of twenty and sixty is 20 ounces of silver. It must be weighed out in keeping with the standard weights that are used in the sacred tent.
Leviticus,27,4,The cost for a female of the same age is 12 ounces of silver.
Leviticus,27,5,The cost for a male between the ages of five and twenty is 8 ounces of silver. The cost for a female of the same age is 4 ounces of silver.
Leviticus,27,6,The cost for a male between the ages of one month and five years is 2 ounces of silver. The cost for a female of the same age is 1 ounce of silver.
Leviticus,27,7,The cost for a male who is sixty years old or more is 6 ounces of silver. The cost for a female of the same age is 4 ounces of silver.
Leviticus,27,8,But suppose the one who makes the special promise is too poor to pay the required amount. Then they must bring to the priest the person who will be set free. The priest will decide the right value for that person. It will be based on how much the one who makes the promise can afford.
Leviticus,27,9,“ ‘Suppose what they promised is an animal that the Lord will accept as an offering. Then the animal given to the Lord becomes holy.
Leviticus,27,10,The one who makes the promise must not trade it. They must not trade a good animal for a bad one. And they must not trade a bad animal for a good one. Suppose they choose one animal instead of another. Then both animals become holy.
Leviticus,27,11,Suppose the animal they promised is not “clean.” Suppose the Lord will not accept it as an offering. Then the animal must be brought to the priest.
Leviticus,27,12,He will decide whether it is good or bad. Its value will be what he decides it will be.
Leviticus,27,13,Suppose the owner wants to buy the animal back. Then a fifth must be added to its cost.
Leviticus,27,14,“ ‘Suppose someone sets apart their house as something holy to the Lord . Then the priest will decide whether it is good or bad. Its value will remain what he decides it will be.
Leviticus,27,15,Suppose the person sets apart their house. And suppose later they want to buy it back. Then they must add a fifth to its value. The house will belong to them again.
Leviticus,27,16,“ ‘Suppose someone sets apart a piece of their family’s land to the Lord . Then here is how its value must be decided. It must be based on the number of seeds that are required to grow a full crop on it. That value will be 20 ounces of silver for every 300 pounds of barley seeds.
Leviticus,27,17,Suppose they set apart their field during the Year of Jubilee. Then the value that has been decided will not be changed.
Leviticus,27,18,But suppose they set apart their field after the Year of Jubilee. Then here is how the priest will decide its value. It will be based on the number of years that are left until the next Year of Jubilee. The value decided will be reduced.
Leviticus,27,19,Suppose the one who set apart their field wants to buy it back. Then they must add a fifth to its value. The field will belong to them again.
Leviticus,27,20,"But suppose they do not buy back the field. Instead, suppose they sell it to someone else. Then they can never buy it back."
Leviticus,27,21,"When the field is set free in the Year of Jubilee, it will become holy. It will be like a field set apart to the Lord . It will become the property of the priests."
Leviticus,27,22,“ ‘Suppose someone sets apart to the Lord a field they have bought. And suppose it is not part of their family’s land.
Leviticus,27,23,Then here is how the priest will decide its value. It will be based on the number of years that are left until the Year of Jubilee. The owner must pay that value on the day it is decided. The money is holy. It is set apart for the Lord.
Leviticus,27,24,In the Year of Jubilee the field will go back to the person it was bought from. That person is the one who had owned the land before.
Leviticus,27,25,Every amount of money must be weighed out in keeping with the standard weights used in the sacred tent.
Leviticus,27,26,“ ‘But no one can set apart the first male animal born to its mother. That animal already belongs to the Lord . It does not matter whether it is an ox or a sheep. It belongs to the Lord.
Leviticus,27,27,Suppose it is an “unclean” animal. Then the owner may buy it back at the value that has been decided. And they must add a fifth to its value. But suppose it is not bought back. Then it must be sold at the value that has been decided.
Leviticus,27,28,“ ‘But nothing a person owns and sets apart to the Lord can be sold or bought back. It does not matter whether it is a human being or an animal or a family’s land. Everything set apart to the Lord is very holy to him.
Leviticus,27,29,“ ‘No one set apart in a special way to be destroyed can be bought back. They must be put to death.
Leviticus,27,30,“ ‘A tenth of everything the land produces belongs to the Lord . That includes grain from the soil and fruit from the trees. It is holy. It is set apart for him.
Leviticus,27,31,Suppose someone wants to buy back some of their tenth. Then they must add a fifth of the cost to it.
Leviticus,27,32,Every tenth part of herds and flocks will be holy. They will be set apart for the Lord . That includes every tenth animal that its shepherd marks with his wooden staff.
Leviticus,27,33,"No one may pick out the good animals from the bad. They must not choose one animal instead of another. But if anyone does, both animals become holy. They can’t be bought back.’ ”"
Leviticus,27,34,The Lord gave Moses all these commands on Mount Sinai for the Israelites.
