Exodus,1,1,Here are the names of Israel’s children who went to Egypt with Jacob. Each one went with his family.
Exodus,1,2,"Jacob’s sons were Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah,"
Exodus,1,3,"Issachar, Zebulun, Benjamin,"
Exodus,1,4,"Dan, Naphtali, Gad and Asher."
Exodus,1,5,The total number of Jacob’s children and grandchildren was 70. Joseph was already in Egypt.
Exodus,1,6,Joseph and all his brothers died. So did all their children.
Exodus,1,7,The people of Israel had many children. The number of them greatly increased. There were so many of them that they filled the land.
Exodus,1,8,Then a new king came to power in Egypt. Joseph didn’t mean anything to him.
Exodus,1,9,"“Look,” he said to his people. “The Israelites are far too many for us."
Exodus,1,10,"Come. We must deal with them carefully. If we don’t, there will be even more of them. Then if war breaks out, they’ll join our enemies. They’ll fight against us and leave the country.”"
Exodus,1,11,So the Egyptians put slave drivers over the people of Israel. The slave drivers treated them badly and made them work hard. The Israelites built the cities of Pithom and Rameses so Pharaoh could store things there.
Exodus,1,12,"But the worse the slave drivers treated the Israelites, the more Israelites there were. So the Egyptians became afraid of them."
Exodus,1,13,They made them work hard. They didn’t show them any pity.
Exodus,1,14,The people suffered because of their hard labor. The slave drivers forced them to work with bricks and mud. And they made them do all kinds of work in the fields. The Egyptians didn’t show them any pity at all. They made them work very hard.
Exodus,1,15,"There were two Hebrew women named Shiphrah and Puah. They helped other women having babies. The king of Egypt spoke to them. He said,"
Exodus,1,16,“You are the ones who help the other Hebrew women. Watch them when they get into a sitting position to have their babies. Kill the boys. Let the girls live.”
Exodus,1,17,But Shiphrah and Puah had respect for God. They didn’t do what the king of Egypt had told them to do. They let the boys live.
Exodus,1,18,"Then the king of Egypt sent for the women. He asked them, “Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?”"
Exodus,1,19,"The women answered Pharaoh, “Hebrew women are not like the women of Egypt. They are strong. They have their babies before we get there.”"
Exodus,1,20,So God was kind to Shiphrah and Puah. And the number of Israelites became even greater.
Exodus,1,21,Shiphrah and Puah had respect for God. So he gave them families of their own.
Exodus,1,22,"Then Pharaoh gave an order to all his people. He said, “You must throw every Hebrew baby boy into the Nile River. But let every Hebrew baby girl live.”"
Exodus,2,1,A man and a woman from the tribe of Levi got married.
Exodus,2,2,She became pregnant and had a son by her husband. She saw that her baby was a fine child. And she hid him for three months.
Exodus,2,3,"After that, she couldn’t hide him any longer. So she got a basket made out of the stems of tall grass. She coated the basket with tar. She placed the child in the basket. Then she put it in the tall grass that grew along the bank of the Nile River."
Exodus,2,4,The child’s sister wasn’t very far away. She wanted to see what would happen to him.
Exodus,2,5,Pharaoh’s daughter went down to the Nile River to take a bath. Her attendants were walking along the river bank. She saw the basket in the tall grass. So she sent her female slave to get it.
Exodus,2,6,"When she opened it, Pharaoh’s daughter saw the baby. He was crying. She felt sorry for him. “This is one of the Hebrew babies,” she said."
Exodus,2,7,"Then his sister spoke to Pharaoh’s daughter. She asked, “Do you want me to go and get one of the Hebrew women? She could breast-feed the baby for you.”"
Exodus,2,8,"“Yes. Go,” she answered. So the girl went and got the baby’s mother."
Exodus,2,9,"Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this baby and feed him for me. I’ll pay you.” So the woman took the baby and fed him."
Exodus,2,10,"When the child grew older, she took him to Pharaoh’s daughter. And he became her son. She named him Moses. She said, “I pulled him out of the water.”"
Exodus,2,11,"Moses grew up. One day, he went out to where his own people were. He watched them while they were hard at work. He saw an Egyptian hitting a Hebrew man. The man was one of Moses’ own people."
Exodus,2,12,Moses looked around and didn’t see anyone. So he killed the Egyptian. Then he hid his body in the sand.
Exodus,2,13,"The next day Moses went out again. He saw two Hebrew men fighting. He asked the one who had started the fight a question. He said, “Why are you hitting another Hebrew man?”"
Exodus,2,14,"The man said, “Who made you ruler and judge over us? Are you thinking about killing me as you killed the Egyptian?” Then Moses became afraid. He thought, “People must have heard about what I did.”"
Exodus,2,15,"When Pharaoh heard about what had happened, he tried to kill Moses. But Moses escaped from Pharaoh and went to live in Midian. There he sat down by a well."
Exodus,2,16,A priest of Midian had seven daughters. They came to fill the stone tubs with water. They wanted to give water to their father’s flock.
Exodus,2,17,Some shepherds came along and chased the girls away. But Moses got up and helped them. Then he gave water to their flock.
Exodus,2,18,"The girls returned to their father Reuel. He asked them, “Why have you returned so early today?”"
Exodus,2,19,"They answered, “An Egyptian saved us from the shepherds. He even got water for us and gave it to the flock.”"
Exodus,2,20,“Where is he?” Reuel asked his daughters. “Why did you leave him? Invite him to have something to eat.”
Exodus,2,21,Moses agreed to stay with the man. And the man gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses to be his wife.
Exodus,2,22,"Zipporah had a son by him. Moses named him Gershom. That’s because Moses said, “I’m an outsider in a strange land.”"
Exodus,2,23,"After a long time, the king of Egypt died. The people of Israel groaned because they were slaves. They also cried out to God. Their cry for help went up to him."
Exodus,2,24,"God heard their groans. He remembered his covenant with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob."
Exodus,2,25,So God looked on the Israelites with concern for them.
Exodus,3,1,Moses was taking care of the flock of his father-in-law Jethro. Jethro was the priest of Midian. Moses led the flock to the western side of the desert. He came to Horeb. It was the mountain of God.
Exodus,3,2,There the angel of the Lord appeared to him from inside a burning bush. Moses saw that the bush was on fire. But it didn’t burn up.
Exodus,3,3,"So Moses thought, “I’ll go over and see this strange sight. Why doesn’t the bush burn up?”"
Exodus,3,4,"The Lord saw that Moses had gone over to look. So God spoke to him from inside the bush. He called out, “Moses! Moses!” “Here I am,” Moses said."
Exodus,3,5,"“Do not come any closer,” God said. “Take off your sandals. The place you are standing on is holy ground.”"
Exodus,3,6,"He continued, “I am the God of your father. I am the God of Abraham. I am the God of Isaac. And I am the God of Jacob.” When Moses heard that, he turned his face away. He was afraid to look at God."
Exodus,3,7,"The Lord said, “I have seen how my people are suffering in Egypt. I have heard them cry out because of their slave drivers. I am concerned about their suffering."
Exodus,3,8,"So I have come down to save them from the Egyptians. I will bring them up out of that land. I will bring them into a good land. It has a lot of room. It is a land that has plenty of milk and honey. The Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites live there."
Exodus,3,9,And now Israel’s cry for help has reached me. I have seen how badly the Egyptians are treating them.
Exodus,3,10,"So now, go. I am sending you to Pharaoh. I want you to bring the Israelites out of Egypt. They are my people.”"
Exodus,3,11,But Moses spoke to God. “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh?” he said. “Who am I that I should bring the Israelites out of Egypt?”
Exodus,3,12,"God said, “I will be with you. I will give you a sign. It will prove that I have sent you. When you have brought the people out of Egypt, all of you will worship me on this mountain.”"
Exodus,3,13,"Moses said to God, “Suppose I go to the people of Israel. Suppose I say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you.’ And suppose they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ Then what should I tell them?”"
Exodus,3,14,"God said to Moses, “ I am who I am . Here is what you must say to the Israelites. Tell them, ‘ I am has sent me to you.’ ”"
Exodus,3,15,"God also said to Moses, “Say to the Israelites, ‘The Lord is the God of your fathers. He has sent me to you. He is the God of Abraham. He is the God of Isaac. And he is the God of Jacob.’ My name will always be The Lord . Call me this name for all time to come."
Exodus,3,16,"“Go. Gather the elders of Israel together. Say to them, ‘The Lord , the God of your fathers, appeared to me. He is the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. God said, “I have watched over you. I have seen what the Egyptians have done to you."
Exodus,3,17,"I have promised to bring you up out of Egypt where you are suffering. I will bring you into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites. It is a land that has plenty of milk and honey.” ’"
Exodus,3,18,"“The elders of Israel will listen to you. Then you and the elders must go to the king of Egypt. You must say to him, ‘The Lord has met with us. He is the God of the Hebrews. Let us take a journey that lasts about three days. We want to go into the desert to offer sacrifices to the Lord our God.’"
Exodus,3,19,But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you and your people go. Only a mighty hand could make him do that.
Exodus,3,20,"So I will reach out my hand. I will strike the Egyptians with all the amazing things I will do. After that, their king will let you go."
Exodus,3,21,"“I will cause the Egyptians to treat you in a kind way. Then when you leave, you will not go with your hands empty."
Exodus,3,22,"Every woman should ask her neighbor and any woman living in her house for things made out of silver and gold. Ask them for clothes too. Put them on your children. In that way, you will take the wealth of Egypt along with you.”"
Exodus,4,1,"Moses answered, “What if the elders of Israel won’t believe me? What if they won’t listen to me? Suppose they say, ‘The Lord didn’t appear to you.’ Then what should I do?”"
Exodus,4,2,"The Lord said to him, “What do you have in your hand?” “A walking stick,” he said."
Exodus,4,3,"The Lord said, “Throw it on the ground.” So Moses threw it on the ground. It turned into a snake. He ran away from it."
Exodus,4,4,"Then the Lord said to Moses, “Reach your hand out. Take the snake by the tail.” So he reached out and grabbed the snake. It turned back into a walking stick in his hand."
Exodus,4,5,"The Lord said, “When they see this sign, they will believe that I appeared to you. I am the Lord , the God of their fathers. I am the God of Abraham. I am the God of Isaac. And I am the God of Jacob.”"
Exodus,4,6,"Then the Lord said, “Put your hand inside your coat.” So Moses put his hand inside his coat. When he took it out, the skin had become as white as snow. His hand was covered with a skin disease."
Exodus,4,7,"“Now put it back into your coat,” the Lord said. So Moses put his hand back into his coat. When he took it out, the skin was healthy again. His hand was like the rest of his skin."
Exodus,4,8,"Then the Lord said, “Suppose they do not believe you or pay attention to the first sign. Then maybe they will believe the second one."
Exodus,4,9,But suppose they do not believe either sign. Suppose they will not listen to you. Then get some water from the Nile River. Pour it on the dry ground. The water you take from the river will turn into blood on the ground.”
Exodus,4,10,"Moses spoke to the Lord . He said, “Lord, I’ve never been a good speaker. And I haven’t gotten any better since you spoke to me. I don’t speak very well at all.”"
Exodus,4,11,"The Lord said to him, “Who makes human beings able to talk? Who makes them unable to hear or speak? Who makes them able to see? Who makes them blind? It is I, the Lord."
Exodus,4,12,Now go. I will help you speak. I will teach you what to say.”
Exodus,4,13,"But Moses said, “Lord, please send someone else to do it.”"
Exodus,4,14,"Then the Lord became very angry with Moses. He said, “What about your brother, Aaron the Levite? I know he can speak well. He is already on his way to meet you. He will be glad to see you."
Exodus,4,15,Speak to him. Tell him what to say. I will help both of you speak. I will teach you what to do.
Exodus,4,16,He will speak to the people for you. He will be like your mouth. And you will be like God to him.
Exodus,4,17,But take this walking stick in your hand. You will be able to do signs with it.”
Exodus,4,18,"Then Moses went back to his father-in-law Jethro. He said to him, “Let me return to my own people in Egypt. I want to see if any of them are still alive.” Jethro said, “Go. I hope everything goes well with you.”"
Exodus,4,19,"The Lord had said to Moses in Midian, “Go back to Egypt. All those who wanted to kill you are dead.”"
Exodus,4,20,So Moses got his wife and sons. He put them on a donkey. Together they started back to Egypt. And he took the walking stick in his hand. It was the stick God would use in a powerful way.
Exodus,4,21,"The Lord spoke to Moses. He said, “When you return to Egypt, do all the amazing things I have given you the power to do. Do them in the sight of Pharaoh. But I will make him stubborn. He will not let the people go."
Exodus,4,22,"Then say to Pharaoh, ‘The Lord says, “Israel is like an oldest son to me."
Exodus,4,23,"I told you, ‘Let my son go. Then he will be able to worship me.’ But you refused to let him go. So I will kill your oldest son.” ’ ”"
Exodus,4,24,"On the way to Egypt, Moses stopped for the night. There the Lord met him and was about to kill him."
Exodus,4,25,"But Zipporah got a knife made out of flint. She circumcised her son with it. Then she touched Moses’ feet with the skin she had cut off. “Surely, you are a husband who has forced me to spill my son’s blood,” she said."
Exodus,4,26,"So the Lord didn’t kill Moses. When she said “husband who has forced me to spill my son’s blood,” she was talking about circumcision."
Exodus,4,27,"The Lord said to Aaron, “Go into the desert to see Moses.” So Aaron greeted Moses at the mountain of God and kissed him."
Exodus,4,28,Then Moses told Aaron everything the Lord had sent him to say. Moses also told him about all the signs the Lord had commanded him to do.
Exodus,4,29,Moses and Aaron gathered all the elders of Israel together.
Exodus,4,30,Aaron told them everything the Lord had said to Moses. He also performed the signs in the sight of the people.
Exodus,4,31,And they believed. They heard that the Lord was concerned about them. He had seen their suffering. So they bowed down and worshiped him.
Exodus,5,1,"Later on, Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh. They said, “The Lord is the God of Israel. He says, ‘Let my people go. Then they will be able to hold a feast to honor me in the desert.’ ”"
Exodus,5,2,"Pharaoh said, “Who is the Lord ? Why should I obey him? Why should I let Israel go? I don’t even know the Lord . And I won’t let Israel go.”"
Exodus,5,3,"Then Moses and Aaron said, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Now let us take a journey that lasts about three days. We want to go into the desert to offer sacrifices to the Lord our God. If we don’t, he might strike us with plagues. Or he might let us be killed by swords.”"
Exodus,5,4,"But the king of Egypt said, “Moses and Aaron, why are you taking the people away from their work? Get back to work!”"
Exodus,5,5,"Pharaoh continued, “There are large numbers of your people in the land. But you are stopping them from working.”"
Exodus,5,6,That same day Pharaoh gave orders to the slave drivers and the overseers in charge of the people.
Exodus,5,7,"He said, “Don’t give the people any more straw to make bricks. Let them go and get their own straw."
Exodus,5,8,"But require them to make the same number of bricks as before. Don’t lower the number they have to make. They are lazy. That’s why they are crying out, ‘Let us go. We want to offer sacrifices to our God.’"
Exodus,5,9,Make them work harder. Then they will be too busy to pay attention to lies.”
Exodus,5,10,"The slave drivers and the overseers left. They said to the people, “Pharaoh says, ‘I won’t give you any more straw."
Exodus,5,11,Go and get your own straw anywhere you can find it. But you still have to make the same number of bricks.’ ”
Exodus,5,12,So the people scattered all over Egypt. They went to gather any pieces of straw left in the fields.
Exodus,5,13,"Pharaoh’s slave drivers kept making the people work hard. They said, “Finish the work you are required to do each day. Make the same number of bricks you made when you had straw.”"
Exodus,5,14,"The slave drivers whipped the Israelite overseers they had appointed. The slave drivers asked, “Why haven’t you made the same number of bricks yesterday or today, just as before?”"
Exodus,5,15,"Then the Israelite overseers appealed to Pharaoh. They asked, “Why have you treated us like this?"
Exodus,5,16,"You didn’t give us any straw. But you told us, ‘Make bricks!’ We are being whipped. But it’s the fault of your own people.”"
Exodus,5,17,"Pharaoh said, “You are lazy! That’s why you keep saying, ‘Let us go. We want to offer sacrifices to the Lord .’"
Exodus,5,18,Now get to work. We won’t give you any straw. But you still have to make the same number of bricks.”
Exodus,5,19,"The Israelite overseers realized they were in trouble. They knew it when they were told, “Don’t reduce the number of bricks you are required to make each day.”"
Exodus,5,20,"When they left Pharaoh, they found Moses and Aaron waiting to meet them."
Exodus,5,21,"They said to Moses and Aaron, “We want the Lord to look at what you have done! We want him to judge you for it! We are like a very bad smell to Pharaoh and his officials. You have given them an excuse to kill us with their swords.”"
Exodus,5,22,"Moses returned to talk to the Lord . He said to him, “Why, Lord? Why have you brought trouble on these people? Is this why you sent me?"
Exodus,5,23,"I went to Pharaoh to speak to him in your name. Ever since then, he has brought nothing but trouble on these people. And you haven’t saved your people at all.”"
Exodus,6,1,"Then the Lord said to Moses, “Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh. Because of my powerful hand, he will let the people of Israel go. Because of my mighty hand, he will drive them out of his country.”"
Exodus,6,2,"God continued, “I am the Lord."
Exodus,6,3,"I appeared to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob as the Mighty God. But I did not show them the full meaning of my name, The Lord."
Exodus,6,4,I also made my covenant with them. I promised to give them the land of Canaan. That is where they lived as outsiders.
Exodus,6,5,"Also, I have heard the groans of the Israelites. The Egyptians are keeping them as slaves. But I have remembered my covenant."
Exodus,6,6,"“So tell the people of Israel, ‘I am the Lord . I will throw off the heavy load the Egyptians have put on your shoulders. I will set you free from being slaves to them. I will reach out my arm and save you with mighty acts when I judge Egypt."
Exodus,6,7,I will take you to be my own people. I will be your God. I throw off the load the Egyptians have put on your shoulders. Then you will know that I am the Lord your God.
Exodus,6,8,"I will bring you to the land I promised to give to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. I lifted up my hand and promised it to them. The land will belong to you. I am the Lord .’ ”"
Exodus,6,9,Moses reported these things to the Israelites. But they didn’t listen to him. That’s because they had lost all hope and had to work very hard.
Exodus,6,10,"Then the Lord said to Moses,"
Exodus,6,11,"“Go. Tell Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, to let the people of Israel leave his country.”"
Exodus,6,12,"But Moses said to the Lord , “The people won’t listen to me. So why would Pharaoh listen to me? After all, I don’t speak very well.”"
Exodus,6,13,"The Lord had spoken to Moses and Aaron. He had talked with them about the Israelites and about Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. He had commanded Moses and Aaron to bring the people of Israel out of Egypt."
Exodus,6,14,"Here were the leaders of the family groups of Reuben, Simeon and Levi. Reuben was the oldest son of Israel. Reuben’s sons were Hanok, Pallu, Hezron and Karmi. These were the family groups of Reuben."
Exodus,6,15,"The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar and Shaul. Shaul was the son of a woman from Canaan. These were the family groups of Simeon."
Exodus,6,16,"Here are the names of the sons of Levi written in their family record. They were Gershon, Kohath and Merari. Levi lived for 137 years."
Exodus,6,17,"The sons of Gershon, by their family groups, were Libni and Shimei."
Exodus,6,18,"The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel. Kohath lived for 133 years."
Exodus,6,19,The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. These are the family groups of Levi written in their family record.
Exodus,6,20,Amram married his father’s sister Jochebed. Aaron and Moses were members of Amram’s family line. Amram lived for 137 years.
Exodus,6,21,"The sons of Izhar were Korah, Nepheg and Zikri."
Exodus,6,22,"The sons of Uzziel were Mishael, Elzaphan and Sithri."
Exodus,6,23,"Aaron married Elisheba. She was the daughter of Amminadab and the sister of Nahshon. She had Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar by Aaron."
Exodus,6,24,"The sons of Korah were Assir, Elkanah and Abiasaph. These were the family groups of Korah."
Exodus,6,25,"Eleazar, the son of Aaron, married one of the daughters of Putiel. She had Phinehas by Eleazar. These are the leaders of the families of Levi. Their names are written in their family records."
Exodus,6,26,"The Lord had spoken to this same Aaron and Moses. He had told them, “Bring the Israelites out of Egypt like an army on the march.”"
Exodus,6,27,"They spoke to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, about bringing the people of Israel out of Egypt. It was this same Moses and Aaron."
Exodus,6,28,The Lord had spoken to Moses in Egypt.
Exodus,6,29,"He had told him, “I am the Lord . Tell Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, everything I tell you.”"
Exodus,6,30,"But Moses said to the Lord , “I don’t speak very well. So why would Pharaoh listen to me?”"
Exodus,7,1,"Then the Lord said to Moses, “I have made you like God to Pharaoh. And your brother Aaron will be like a prophet to you."
Exodus,7,2,You must say everything I command you to say. Then your brother Aaron must tell Pharaoh to let the people of Israel leave his country.
Exodus,7,3,But I will make Pharaoh stubborn. I will multiply the signs and amazing things I will do in Egypt.
Exodus,7,4,"In spite of that, he will not listen to you. So I will use my powerful hand against Egypt. When I judge them with mighty acts, I will bring my people Israel out like an army on the march."
Exodus,7,5,Then the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord . I will reach out my powerful hand against them. I will bring the people of Israel out of Egypt.”
Exodus,7,6,Moses and Aaron did exactly as the Lord had commanded them.
Exodus,7,7,Moses was 80 years old and Aaron was 83 when they spoke to Pharaoh.
Exodus,7,8,The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron.
Exodus,7,9,"He said, “Pharaoh will say to you, ‘Do a miracle.’ When he does, speak to Aaron. Tell him, ‘Take your walking stick and throw it down in front of Pharaoh.’ It will turn into a snake.”"
Exodus,7,10,So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh. They did exactly as the Lord had commanded them. Aaron threw the stick down in front of Pharaoh and his officials. It turned into a snake.
Exodus,7,11,"Then Pharaoh sent for wise men and people who do evil magic. By doing their magic tricks, the Egyptian magicians did the same things Aaron had done."
Exodus,7,12,Each one threw down his walking stick. Each stick turned into a snake. But Aaron’s walking stick swallowed theirs up.
Exodus,7,13,"In spite of that, Pharaoh became stubborn. He wouldn’t listen to them, just as the Lord had said."
Exodus,7,14,"Then the Lord said to Moses, “Pharaoh is very stubborn. He refuses to let the people go."
Exodus,7,15,In the morning Pharaoh will go down to the Nile River. Go and meet him on the bank of the river. Take in your hand the walking stick that turned into a snake.
Exodus,7,16,"Say to Pharaoh, ‘The Lord , the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to you. He says, “Let my people go. Then they will be able to worship me in the desert. But up to now you have not listened.”"
Exodus,7,17,"The Lord says, “Here is how you will know that I am the Lord . I will strike the water of the Nile River with the walking stick that is in my hand. The river will turn into blood."
Exodus,7,18,The fish in the river will die. The river will stink. The Egyptians will not be able to drink its water.” ’ ”
Exodus,7,19,"The Lord said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Get your walking stick. Reach your hand out over the waters of Egypt. The streams, canals, ponds and all the lakes will turn into blood. There will be blood everywhere in Egypt. It will even be in the wooden buckets and stone jars.’ ”"
Exodus,7,20,Moses and Aaron did exactly as the Lord had commanded them. Aaron held out his staff in front of Pharaoh and his officials. He struck the water of the Nile River. And all the water turned into blood.
Exodus,7,21,The fish in the Nile died. The river smelled so bad the Egyptians couldn’t drink its water. There was blood everywhere in Egypt.
Exodus,7,22,"But the Egyptian magicians did the same things by doing their magic tricks. So Pharaoh became stubborn. He wouldn’t listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the Lord had said."
Exodus,7,23,"Even that miracle didn’t change Pharaoh’s mind. In fact, he turned around and went into his palace."
Exodus,7,24,All the Egyptians dug holes near the Nile River to get drinking water. They couldn’t drink water from the river.
Exodus,7,25,Seven days passed after the Lord struck the Nile River.
Exodus,8,1,"Then the Lord said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh. Tell him, ‘The Lord says, “Let my people go. Then they will be able to worship me."
Exodus,8,2,"If you refuse to let them go, I will send a plague of frogs on your whole country."
Exodus,8,3,The Nile River will be full of frogs. They will come up into your palace. You will have frogs in your bedroom and on your bed. They will be in the homes of your officials and your people. They will be in your ovens and in the bowls for kneading your bread.
Exodus,8,4,"The frogs will be on you, your people and all your officials.” ’ ”"
Exodus,8,5,"Then the Lord spoke to Moses. He said, “Tell Aaron, ‘Reach out your hand. Hold your walking stick over the streams, canals and ponds. Make frogs come up on the land of Egypt.’ ”"
Exodus,8,6,So Aaron reached out his hand over the waters of Egypt. The frogs came up and covered the land.
Exodus,8,7,But the magicians did the same things by doing their magic tricks. They also made frogs come up on the land of Egypt.
Exodus,8,8,"Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron. He said to them, “Pray to the Lord to take the frogs away from me and my people. Then I’ll let your people go to offer sacrifices to the Lord .”"
Exodus,8,9,"Moses said to Pharaoh, “You can have the honor of setting the time for me to pray. I will pray for you, your officials and your people. I’ll pray that the frogs will leave you and your homes. The only frogs left will be the ones in the Nile River.”"
Exodus,8,10,"“Tomorrow,” Pharaoh said. Moses replied, “It will happen just as you say. Then you will know that there is no one like the Lord our God."
Exodus,8,11,The frogs will leave you and your houses. They will leave your officials and your people. The frogs will remain only in the Nile River.”
Exodus,8,12,Moses and Aaron left Pharaoh. Then Moses cried out to the Lord about the frogs he had brought on Pharaoh.
Exodus,8,13,"And the Lord did what Moses asked. The frogs died in the houses, courtyards and fields."
Exodus,8,14,The Egyptians piled them up. The land smelled very bad because of them.
Exodus,8,15,"But when Pharaoh saw that the frogs were dead, he became stubborn. He wouldn’t listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the Lord had said."
Exodus,8,16,"Then the Lord spoke to Moses. He said, “Tell Aaron, ‘Reach out your walking stick. Strike the dust on the ground with it.’ Then all over the land of Egypt the dust will turn into gnats.”"
Exodus,8,17,So they did it. Aaron reached out the stick that was in his hand. He struck the dust on the ground with it. The dust all over the land of Egypt turned into gnats. They landed on people and animals alike.
Exodus,8,18,The magicians tried to produce gnats by doing their magic tricks. But they couldn’t. The gnats stayed on people and animals everywhere.
Exodus,8,19,"So the magicians said to Pharaoh, “God’s powerful finger has done this.” But Pharaoh remained stubborn. He wouldn’t listen, just as the Lord had said."
Exodus,8,20,"Then the Lord spoke to Moses. He said, “Get up early in the morning. Talk to Pharaoh as he goes down to the Nile River. Say to him, ‘The Lord says, “Let my people go. Then they will be able to worship me."
Exodus,8,21,"If you do not let my people go, I will send large numbers of flies. I will send them on you and your officials. I will send them on your people and into your homes. The houses of the Egyptians will be full of flies. Even the ground will be covered with them."
Exodus,8,22,"“ ‘ “But on that day I will treat the area of Goshen differently from yours. That is where my people live. There will not be large numbers of flies in Goshen. Then you will know that I, the Lord , am in this land."
Exodus,8,23,I will treat my people differently from yours. This sign will take place tomorrow.” ’ ”
Exodus,8,24,So the Lord did it. Huge numbers of flies poured into Pharaoh’s palace. They came into the homes of his officials. All over Egypt the flies destroyed the land.
Exodus,8,25,"Then Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron. He said to them, “Go. Offer sacrifices to your God here in the land.”"
Exodus,8,26,"But Moses said, “That wouldn’t be right. The sacrifices we offer to the Lord our God wouldn’t be accepted by the Egyptians because of their beliefs. For that reason, they would throw stones at us and try to kill us."
Exodus,8,27,"We have to take a journey that lasts about three days. We want to go into the desert to offer sacrifices to the Lord our God, just as he commands us.”"
Exodus,8,28,"Pharaoh said, “I will let you and your people go to offer sacrifices. You can offer them to the Lord your God in the desert. But you must not go very far. Now pray for me.”"
Exodus,8,29,"Moses replied, “As soon as I leave you, I will pray to the Lord . Tomorrow the flies will leave you. They will also leave your officials and your people. Just be sure you don’t try to trick us again. Let the people go to offer sacrifices to the Lord .”"
Exodus,8,30,Then Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the Lord.
Exodus,8,31,"And the Lord did what Moses asked. The flies left Pharaoh, his officials and his people. Not one fly remained."
Exodus,8,32,But Pharaoh became stubborn this time also. He wouldn’t let the people go.
Exodus,9,1,"Then the Lord spoke to Moses. He said, “Go to Pharaoh. Tell him, ‘The Lord , the God of the Hebrews, says, “Let my people go. Then they will be able to worship me."
Exodus,9,2,Do not refuse to let them go. Do not keep holding them back.
Exodus,9,3,"If you refuse, my powerful hand will bring a terrible plague on you. I will strike your livestock in the fields. I will strike your horses, donkeys, camels, cattle, sheep and goats."
Exodus,9,4,But I will treat Israel’s livestock differently from yours. No animal that belongs to the people of Israel will die.” ’ ”
Exodus,9,5,"The Lord set a time for the plague. He said, “Tomorrow I will send it on the land.”"
Exodus,9,6,So the next day the Lord sent it. All the livestock of the Egyptians died. But not one animal that belonged to the Israelites died.
Exodus,9,7,Pharaoh searched and found out what had happened. He discovered that not even one animal that belonged to the Israelites had died. But he was still very stubborn. He wouldn’t let the people go.
Exodus,9,8,"Then the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron. He said, “Take handfuls of ashes from a furnace. Have Moses toss them into the air in front of Pharaoh."
Exodus,9,9,The ashes will turn into fine dust over the whole land of Egypt. Then painful boils will break out on people and animals all over the land. Their bodies will be covered with them.”
Exodus,9,10,So Moses and Aaron took ashes from a furnace and stood in front of Pharaoh. Moses tossed them into the air. Then boils broke out on people and animals alike.
Exodus,9,11,The bodies of all the Egyptians were covered with boils. The magicians couldn’t stand in front of Moses because of the boils that were all over them.
Exodus,9,12,"But the Lord made Pharaoh stubborn. Pharaoh wouldn’t listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the Lord had said to Moses."
Exodus,9,13,"Then the Lord spoke to Moses. He said, “Get up early in the morning. Go to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘The Lord , the God of the Hebrews, says, “Let my people go. Then they will be able to worship me."
Exodus,9,14,"If you do not let them go, I will send the full force of my plagues against you this time. They will strike your officials and your people. Then you will know that there is no one like me in the whole earth."
Exodus,9,15,By now I could have reached out my hand. I could have struck you and your people with a plague that would have wiped you off the earth.
Exodus,9,16,But I had a special reason for making you king. I decided to show you my power. I wanted my name to become known everywhere on earth.
Exodus,9,17,But you are still against my people. You will not let them go.
Exodus,9,18,So at this time tomorrow I will send the worst hailstorm ever to fall on Egypt in its entire history.
Exodus,9,19,Give an order now to bring your livestock inside to a safe place. Bring in everything that is outside. The hail will fall on all the people and animals that are left outside. They will die.” ’ ”
Exodus,9,20,The officials of Pharaoh who had respect for what the Lord had said obeyed him. They hurried to bring their slaves and their livestock inside.
Exodus,9,21,But others didn’t pay attention to what the Lord had said. They left their slaves and livestock outside.
Exodus,9,22,"Then the Lord spoke to Moses. He said, “Reach out your hand toward the sky. Then hail will fall all over Egypt. It will beat down on people and animals alike. It will strike everything growing in the fields of Egypt.”"
Exodus,9,23,Moses reached out his walking stick toward the sky. Then the Lord sent thunder and hail. Lightning flashed down to the ground. The Lord rained hail on the land of Egypt.
Exodus,9,24,Hail fell and lightning flashed back and forth. It was the worst storm in Egypt’s entire history.
Exodus,9,25,Hail struck everything in the fields all over Egypt. It fell on people and animals alike. It beat down everything growing in the fields. It tore all the leaves off the trees.
Exodus,9,26,The only place it didn’t hail was in the area of Goshen. That’s where the people of Israel were.
Exodus,9,27,"Then Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron. “This time I’ve sinned,” he said to them. “The Lord has done what is right. I and my people have done what is wrong."
Exodus,9,28,"Pray to the Lord , because we’ve had enough thunder and hail. I’ll let you and your people go. You don’t have to stay here any longer.”"
Exodus,9,29,"Moses replied, “When I’ve left the city, I’ll lift up my hands and pray to the Lord . The thunder will stop. There won’t be any more hail. Then you will know that the earth belongs to the Lord."
Exodus,9,30,But I know that you and your officials still don’t have any respect for the Lord God.”
Exodus,9,31,The barley was ripe. The flax was in bloom. So they were both destroyed.
Exodus,9,32,But the wheat and spelt weren’t destroyed. That’s because they ripen later.
Exodus,9,33,Then Moses left Pharaoh and went out of the city. Moses lifted up his hands and prayed to the Lord . The thunder and hail stopped. The rain didn’t pour down on the land any longer.
Exodus,9,34,"Pharaoh saw that the rain, hail and thunder had stopped. So he sinned again. He and his officials became stubborn."
Exodus,9,35,"So Pharaoh was stubborn. He wouldn’t let the people of Israel go, just as the Lord had said through Moses."
Exodus,10,1,"Then the Lord said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh. I have made him stubborn. I have also made his officials stubborn so I can perform my signs among them."
Exodus,10,2,Then you will be able to tell your children and grandchildren how hard I was on the Egyptians. You can tell them I performed my signs among the people of Egypt. And all of you will know that I am the Lord .”
Exodus,10,3,"So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh. They said to him, “The Lord , the God of the Hebrews, says, ‘How long will you refuse to obey me? Let my people go. Then they will be able to worship me."
Exodus,10,4,"If you refuse to let them go, I will bring locusts into your country tomorrow."
Exodus,10,5,They will cover the ground so that it can’t be seen. They will eat what little you have left after the hail. That includes every tree growing in your fields.
Exodus,10,6,They will fill your houses. They will be in the homes of all your officials and your people. Your parents and your people before them have never seen anything like it as long as they have lived here.’ ” Then Moses turned around and left Pharaoh.
Exodus,10,7,"Pharaoh’s officials said to him, “How long will this man be a trap for us? Let the people go. Then they’ll be able to worship the Lord their God. After everything that’s happened, don’t you realize that Egypt is destroyed?”"
Exodus,10,8,"Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. “Go. Worship the Lord your God,” he said. “But tell me who will be going.”"
Exodus,10,9,"Moses answered, “We’ll go with our young people and old people. We’ll go with our sons and daughters. We’ll take our flocks and herds. We are supposed to hold a feast to honor the Lord .”"
Exodus,10,10,"Pharaoh said, “Suppose I ever let you go, along with your women and children. Then the Lord really will be with all of you! Clearly you are planning to do something bad."
Exodus,10,11,"No! I’ll only allow the men to go and worship the Lord . After all, that’s what you have been asking for.” Then Pharaoh drove Moses and Aaron out of his sight."
Exodus,10,12,"The Lord said to Moses, “Reach out your hand over Egypt so that locusts cover the land. They will eat up everything growing in the fields. They will eat up everything left by the hail.”"
Exodus,10,13,So Moses reached out his walking stick over Egypt. Then the Lord made an east wind blow across the land. It blew all that day and all that night. By morning the wind had brought the locusts.
Exodus,10,14,Large numbers of them came down in every part of Egypt. There had never been a plague of locusts like it before. And there will never be one like it again.
Exodus,10,15,The locusts covered the ground until it was black. They ate up everything left after the hail. They ate up everything growing in the fields. They ate up the fruit on the trees. There was nothing green left on any tree or plant in the whole land of Egypt.
Exodus,10,16,"Pharaoh quickly sent for Moses and Aaron. He said, “I have sinned against the Lord your God. I’ve also sinned against you."
Exodus,10,17,Now forgive my sin one more time. Pray to the Lord your God to take this deadly plague away from me.”
Exodus,10,18,"After Moses left Pharaoh, he prayed to the Lord."
Exodus,10,19,The Lord changed the wind to a very strong west wind. It picked up the locusts. It blew them into the Red Sea. Not even one locust was left anywhere in Egypt.
Exodus,10,20,But the Lord made Pharaoh stubborn. So Pharaoh wouldn’t let the people of Israel go.
Exodus,10,21,"The Lord spoke to Moses. He said, “Reach out your hand toward the sky so that darkness spreads over Egypt. It will be so dark that people can feel it.”"
Exodus,10,22,So Moses reached out his hand toward the sky. Then complete darkness covered Egypt for three days.
Exodus,10,23,No one could see anyone else or go anywhere for three days. But all the people of Israel had light where they lived.
Exodus,10,24,"Then Pharaoh sent for Moses. He said to him, “Go. Worship the Lord . Even your women and children can go with you. Just leave your flocks and herds behind.”"
Exodus,10,25,"But Moses said, “You must allow us to take our animals. We need to offer them as sacrifices and burnt offerings to the Lord our God."
Exodus,10,26,"Our livestock must also go with us. We have to use some of them to worship the Lord our God. We can’t leave even one animal behind. Until we get there, we won’t know what we are supposed to use to worship the Lord .”"
Exodus,10,27,But the Lord made Pharaoh stubborn. So he wouldn’t let the people go.
Exodus,10,28,"Pharaoh said to Moses, “Get out of my sight! Make sure you don’t come to see me again! If you do, you will die.”"
Exodus,10,29,"“I’ll do just as you say,” Moses replied. “I will never come to see you again.”"
Exodus,11,1,"The Lord had spoken to Moses. He had said, “I will bring one more plague on Pharaoh and on Egypt. After that, he will let you and your people go. When he does, he will drive every one of you away."
Exodus,11,2,Tell the men and women alike to ask their neighbors for things made out of silver and gold.”
Exodus,11,3,The Lord caused the Egyptians to treat the Israelites in a kind way. Pharaoh’s officials and the people had great respect for Moses.
Exodus,11,4,"Moses told Pharaoh, “The Lord says, ‘About midnight I will go through every part of Egypt."
Exodus,11,5,"Every oldest son in Egypt will die. The oldest son of Pharaoh, who sits on the throne, will die. The oldest son of every female slave, who works at her hand mill, will die. All the male animals born first to their mothers among the cattle will also die."
Exodus,11,6,There will be loud crying all over Egypt. It will be worse than it’s ever been before. And nothing like it will ever be heard again.
Exodus,11,7,But among the Israelites not even one dog will bark at any person or animal.’ Then you will know that the Lord treats Egypt differently from us.
Exodus,11,8,"All your officials will come and bow down to me. They will say, ‘Go, you and all the people who follow you!’ After that, I will leave.” Moses was very angry when he left Pharaoh."
Exodus,11,9,"The Lord had spoken to Moses. He had said, “Pharaoh will refuse to listen to you. So I will multiply the amazing things I will do in Egypt.”"
Exodus,11,10,Moses and Aaron performed all these amazing things in the sight of Pharaoh. But the Lord made Pharaoh stubborn. He wouldn’t let the people of Israel go out of his country.
Exodus,12,1,The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron in Egypt.
Exodus,12,2,"He said, “From now on, this month will be your first month. Each of your years will begin with it."
Exodus,12,3,Speak to the whole community of Israel. Tell them that on the tenth day of this month each man must get a lamb from his flock. A lamb should be chosen for each family and home.
Exodus,12,4,Suppose there are not enough people in your family to eat a whole lamb. Then you must share some of it with your nearest neighbor. You must add up the total number of people there are. You must decide how much lamb is needed for each person.
Exodus,12,5,The animals you choose must be males that are a year old. They must not have any flaws. You may choose either sheep or goats.
Exodus,12,6,Take care of them until the 14th day of the month. Then the whole community of Israel must kill them when the sun goes down.
Exodus,12,7,Take some of the blood. Put it on the sides and tops of the doorframes of the houses where you eat the lambs.
Exodus,12,8,That same night eat the meat cooked over a fire. Also eat bitter plants. And eat bread made without yeast.
Exodus,12,9,"Do not eat the meat when it is raw. Don’t boil it in water. Instead, cook it over a fire. Cook the head, legs and inside parts."
Exodus,12,10,"Do not leave any of it until morning. If some is left over until morning, burn it up."
Exodus,12,11,Eat the meat while your coat is tucked into your belt. Put your sandals on your feet. Take your walking stick in your hand. Eat the food quickly. It is the Lord ’s Passover.
Exodus,12,12,“That same night I will pass through Egypt. I will strike down all those born first among the people and animals. And I will judge all the gods of Egypt. I am the Lord.
Exodus,12,13,"The blood on your houses will be a sign for you. When I see the blood, I will pass over you. No deadly plague will touch you when I strike Egypt."
Exodus,12,14,“Always remember this day. You and your children after you must celebrate this day as a feast to honor the Lord . You must do this for all time to come. It is a law that will last forever.
Exodus,12,15,"For seven days eat bread made without yeast. On the first day remove the yeast from your homes. For the next seven days, anyone who eats anything with yeast in it must be separated from Israel."
Exodus,12,16,"On the first and seventh days, come together for a sacred assembly. Do not work at all on these days. The only thing you are allowed to do is prepare food for everyone to eat."
Exodus,12,17,“Celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread. I brought you out of Egypt on this very day like an army on the march. It is a law that will last for all time to come.
Exodus,12,18,In the first month eat bread made without yeast. Eat it from the evening of the 14th day until the evening of the 21st day.
Exodus,12,19,For seven days do not let any yeast be found in your homes. Anyone who eats anything with yeast in it must be separated from the community of Israel. That applies to outsiders and Israelites alike.
Exodus,12,20,"Do not eat anything made with yeast. No matter where you live, eat bread made without yeast.”"
Exodus,12,21,"Then Moses sent for all the elders of Israel. He said to them, “Go at once. Choose the animals for your families. Each family must kill a Passover lamb."
Exodus,12,22,Get a branch of a hyssop plant. Dip it into the blood in the bowl. Put some of the blood on the top and on both sides of the doorframe. None of you can go out of the door of your house until morning.
Exodus,12,23,The Lord will go through the land to strike down the Egyptians. He’ll see the blood on the top and sides of the doorframe. He will pass over that house. He won’t let the destroying angel enter your homes to strike you down.
Exodus,12,24,“Obey all these directions. It’s a law for you and your children after you for all time to come.
Exodus,12,25,"The Lord will give you the land, just as he promised. When you enter it, keep this holy day."
Exodus,12,26,"Your children will ask you, ‘What does this holy day mean to you?’"
Exodus,12,27,"Tell them, ‘It’s the Passover sacrifice to honor the Lord . He passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt. He spared our homes when he struck down the Egyptians.’ ” Then the Israelites bowed down and worshiped."
Exodus,12,28,They did just what the Lord commanded Moses and Aaron.
Exodus,12,29,"At midnight the Lord struck down every oldest son in Egypt. He killed the oldest son of Pharaoh, who sat on the throne. He killed all the oldest sons of prisoners. He also killed all the male animals born first to their mothers among the livestock."
Exodus,12,30,Pharaoh and all his officials got up during the night. So did all the Egyptians. There was loud crying in Egypt because someone had died in every home.
Exodus,12,31,"During the night, Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron. He said to them, “Get out of here! You and the Israelites, leave my people! Go. Worship the Lord , just as you have asked."
Exodus,12,32,"Go. Take your flocks and herds, just as you have said. And also give me your blessing.”"
Exodus,12,33,"The Egyptians begged the people of Israel to hurry up and leave the country. “If you don’t,” they said, “we’ll all die!”"
Exodus,12,34,So the people took their dough before the yeast was added to it. They carried it on their shoulders in bowls for kneading bread. The bowls were wrapped in clothes.
Exodus,12,35,They did just as Moses had directed them. They asked the Egyptians for things made out of silver and gold. They also asked them for clothes.
Exodus,12,36,The Lord had caused the Egyptians to treat the Israelites in a kind way. So the Egyptians gave them what they asked for. The Israelites took many expensive things that belonged to the Egyptians.
Exodus,12,37,"The Israelites traveled from Rameses to Sukkoth. There were about 600,000 men old enough to go into battle. The women and children went with them."
Exodus,12,38,So did many other people. The Israelites also took large flocks and herds with them.
Exodus,12,39,The Israelites brought dough from Egypt. With it they baked loaves of bread without yeast. The dough didn’t have any yeast in it. That’s because the people had been driven out of Egypt before they had time to prepare their food.
Exodus,12,40,The Israelites lived in Egypt for 430 years.
Exodus,12,41,"Then all the Lord ’s people marched out of Egypt like an army. That happened at the end of the 430 years, to the exact day."
Exodus,12,42,The Lord kept watch that night to bring them out of Egypt. So on that same night every year all the Israelites must keep watch. They must do it to honor the Lord for all time to come.
Exodus,12,43,"The Lord said to Moses and Aaron, “Here are the rules for the Passover meal. “No one from another country is allowed to eat it."
Exodus,12,44,Any slave you have bought is allowed to eat it after you have circumcised him.
Exodus,12,45,But a hired worker or someone who lives with you for a short time is not allowed to eat it.
Exodus,12,46,“It must be eaten inside the house. Do not take any of the meat outside. Do not break any of the bones.
Exodus,12,47,The whole community of Israel must celebrate the Passover.
Exodus,12,48,"“Suppose an outsider living among you wants to celebrate the Lord ’s Passover. Then all the males in that home must be circumcised. After that, the person can take part, just like an Israelite. Only circumcised males may eat it."
Exodus,12,49,The same law applies to Israelites and to outsiders living among you.”
Exodus,12,50,All the people of Israel did just what the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron.
Exodus,12,51,On that day the Lord brought the Israelites out of Egypt like an army on the march.
Exodus,13,1,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Exodus,13,2,“Set apart for me the first boy born in every family. The oldest son of every Israelite mother belongs to me. Every male animal born first to its mother also belongs to me.”
Exodus,13,3,"Then Moses said to the people, “Remember this day. It’s the day you came out of Egypt. That’s the land where you were slaves. The Lord used his mighty hand to bring you out of Egypt. Don’t eat anything with yeast in it."
Exodus,13,4,You are leaving today. It’s the month of Aviv.
Exodus,13,5,"The Lord will bring you into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites and Jebusites. He promised your people of long ago that he would give that land to you. It’s a land that has plenty of milk and honey. When you get there, celebrate this holy day in this month."
Exodus,13,6,For seven days eat bread made without yeast. On the seventh day hold a feast to honor the Lord.
Exodus,13,7,Eat bread made without yeast during those seven days. Nothing with yeast in it should be found among you. No yeast should be seen anywhere inside your borders.
Exodus,13,8,"On that day talk to your child. Say, ‘I’m doing this because of what the Lord did for me when I came out of Egypt.’"
Exodus,13,9,"When you celebrate this holy day, it will be like a mark on your hand. It will be like a reminder on your forehead. This law of the Lord must be on your lips. The Lord used his mighty hand to bring you out of Egypt."
Exodus,13,10,Obey this law at the appointed time year after year.
Exodus,13,11,"“The Lord will bring you into the land of Canaan. He will give it to you, just as he promised he would. He gave his word to you and your people of long ago."
Exodus,13,12,"After you arrive in the land, give to the Lord the oldest son of every mother. Every male animal born first to its mother among your livestock belongs to the Lord."
Exodus,13,13,"By sacrificing a lamb, buy back every male donkey born first to its mother. But if you don’t buy the donkey back, break its neck. Buy back every oldest son."
Exodus,13,14,"“In days to come, your child will ask you, ‘What does this mean?’ Say to them, ‘The Lord used his mighty hand to bring us out of Egypt. That’s the land where we were slaves."
Exodus,13,15,Pharaoh was stubborn. He refused to let us go. So the Lord killed every oldest son in Egypt. He also killed all those born first among the people and animals. That’s why I sacrifice to the Lord every male animal born first. And that’s why I buy back each of my oldest sons for the Lord .’
Exodus,13,16,This holy day will be like a mark on your hand. It will be like a sign on your forehead. It will remind you that the Lord used his mighty hand to bring us out of Egypt.”
Exodus,13,17,"Pharaoh let the people go. The shortest road from Goshen to Canaan went through the Philistine country. But God didn’t lead them that way. God said, “If they have to go into battle, they might change their minds. They might return to Egypt.”"
Exodus,13,18,So God led the people toward the Red Sea by taking them on a road through the desert. The Israelites were ready for battle when they went up out of Egypt.
Exodus,13,19,"Moses took the bones of Joseph along with him. Joseph had made the Israelites give their word to do this. He had said, “God will surely come to help you. When he does, you must carry my bones up from this place with you.”( Genesis 50:25)"
Exodus,13,20,The people left Sukkoth. They camped at Etham on the edge of the desert.
Exodus,13,21,By day the Lord went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud. It guided them on their way. At night he led them with a pillar of fire. It gave them light. So they could travel by day or at night.
Exodus,13,22,The pillar of cloud didn’t leave its place in front of the people during the day. And the pillar of fire didn’t leave its place at night.
Exodus,14,1,Then the Lord spoke to Moses.
Exodus,14,2,"He said, “Tell the people of Israel to turn back. Have them camp near Pi Hahiroth between Migdol and the Red Sea. They must camp by the sea, right across from Baal Zephon."
Exodus,14,3,"Pharaoh will think, ‘The Israelites are wandering around the land. They don’t know which way to go. The desert is all around them.’"
Exodus,14,4,I will make Pharaoh stubborn. He will chase them. But I will gain glory for myself because of what will happen to Pharaoh and his whole army. And the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord .” So the Israelites camped by the Red Sea.
Exodus,14,5,"The king of Egypt was told that the people had escaped. Then Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds about them. They said, “What have we done? We’ve let the people of Israel go! We’ve lost our slaves and all the work they used to do for us!”"
Exodus,14,6,So he had his chariot made ready. He took his army with him.
Exodus,14,7,He took 600 of the best chariots in Egypt. He also took along all the other chariots. Officers were in charge of all of them.
Exodus,14,8,"The Lord made Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, stubborn. So he chased the Israelites as they were marching out boldly."
Exodus,14,9,"The Egyptians went after the Israelites. All Pharaoh’s horses and chariots and horsemen and troops chased them. They caught up with the Israelites as they camped by the sea. The Israelites were near Pi Hahiroth, across from Baal Zephon."
Exodus,14,10,"As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked back. There were the Egyptians marching after them! The Israelites were terrified. They cried out to the Lord."
Exodus,14,11,"They said to Moses, “Why did you bring us to the desert to die? Weren’t there any graves in Egypt? What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt?"
Exodus,14,12,"We told you in Egypt, ‘Leave us alone. Let us serve the Egyptians.’ It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die here in the desert!”"
Exodus,14,13,"Moses answered the people. He said, “Don’t be afraid. Stand firm. You will see how the Lord will save you today. Do you see those Egyptians? You will never see them again."
Exodus,14,14,The Lord will fight for you. Just be still.”
Exodus,14,15,"Then the Lord spoke to Moses. He said, “Why are you crying out to me? Tell the people of Israel to move on."
Exodus,14,16,Hold out your walking stick. Reach out your hand over the Red Sea to divide the water. Then the people can go through the sea on dry ground.
Exodus,14,17,"I will make the Egyptians stubborn. They will go in after the Israelites. I will gain glory for myself because of what will happen to Pharaoh, his army, chariots and horsemen."
Exodus,14,18,"The Egyptians will know that I am the Lord . I will gain glory because of what will happen to Pharaoh, his chariots and his horsemen.”"
Exodus,14,19,The angel of God had been traveling in front of Israel’s army. Now he moved back and went behind them. The pillar of cloud also moved away from in front of them. Now it stood behind them.
Exodus,14,20,It came between the armies of Egypt and Israel. All through the night the cloud brought darkness to one side and light to the other. Neither army went near the other all night long.
Exodus,14,21,Then Moses reached out his hand over the Red Sea. All that night the Lord pushed the sea back with a strong east wind. He turned the sea into dry land. The waters were divided.
Exodus,14,22,The people of Israel went through the sea on dry ground. There was a wall of water on their right side and on their left.
Exodus,14,23,The Egyptians chased them. All Pharaoh’s horses and chariots and horsemen followed them into the sea.
Exodus,14,24,Near the end of the night the Lord looked down from the pillar of fire and cloud. He saw the Egyptian army and threw it into a panic.
Exodus,14,25,"He jammed the wheels of their chariots. That made the chariots hard to drive. The Egyptians said, “Let’s get away from the Israelites! The Lord is fighting for Israel against Egypt.”"
Exodus,14,26,"Then the Lord spoke to Moses. He said, “Reach out your hand over the sea. The waters will flow back over the Egyptians and their chariots and horsemen.”"
Exodus,14,27,So Moses reached out his hand over the sea. At sunrise the sea went back to its place. The Egyptians tried to run away from the sea. But the Lord swept them into it.
Exodus,14,28,The water flowed back and covered the chariots and horsemen. It covered the entire army of Pharaoh that had followed the people of Israel into the sea. Not one of the Egyptians was left.
Exodus,14,29,But the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground. There was a wall of water on their right side and on their left.
Exodus,14,30,That day the Lord saved Israel from the power of Egypt. The Israelites saw the Egyptians lying dead on the shore.
Exodus,14,31,The Israelites saw the amazing power the Lord showed against the Egyptians. So the Israelites had great respect for the Lord and put their trust in him. They also put their trust in his servant Moses.
Exodus,15,1,"Here is the song that Moses and the people of Israel sang to the Lord . They said, “I will sing to the Lord. He is greatly honored. He has thrown Pharaoh’s horses and chariot drivers into the Red Sea."
Exodus,15,2,"The Lord gives me strength and protects me. He has saved me. He is my God, I will praise him. He is my father’s God, and I will honor him."
Exodus,15,3,The Lord goes into battle. The Lord is his name.
Exodus,15,4,He has thrown Pharaoh’s chariots and army into the Red Sea. Pharaoh’s best officers drowned in the sea.
Exodus,15,5,The deep waters covered them. They sank to the bottom like a stone.
Exodus,15,6,"“ Lord , your right hand was majestic and powerful. Lord , your right hand destroyed your enemies."
Exodus,15,7,"Because of your great majesty, you threw down those who opposed you. Your burning anger blazed out. It burned them up like straw."
Exodus,15,8,The powerful blast from your nose piled up the waters. The rushing waters stood firm like a wall. The deep waters stood up in the middle of the sea.
Exodus,15,9,"“Your enemies bragged, ‘We will chase Israel and will catch them. We’ll divide up what we take from them. We’ll eat them alive. We’ll pull our swords out. Our powerful hands will destroy them.’"
Exodus,15,10,But you blew with your breath. The Red Sea covered your enemies. They sank like lead in the mighty waters.
Exodus,15,11,"“ Lord , who among the gods is like you? Who is like you? You are majestic and holy. Your glory fills me with wonder. You do amazing things."
Exodus,15,12,You reach out your right hand. The earth swallows up your enemies.
Exodus,15,13,"“Because your love is faithful, you will lead the people you have set free. Because you are so strong, you will guide them to the holy place where you live."
Exodus,15,14,The nations will hear about it and tremble. Pain and suffering will take hold of the Philistines.
Exodus,15,15,The chiefs of Edom will be terrified. The leaders of Moab will tremble with fear. The people of Canaan will melt away.
Exodus,15,16,"Fear and terror will fall on them. Your powerful arm will make them as still as a stone. Then your people will pass by, Lord. Then the people you created will pass by."
Exodus,15,17,"You will bring them in. You will plant them on the mountain you gave them. Lord , you have made that place your home. Lord, your hands have made your holy place secure."
Exodus,15,18,“The Lord rules for ever and ever.”
Exodus,15,19,"Pharaoh’s horses, chariots and horsemen went into the Red Sea. The Lord brought the waters of the sea back over them. But the people of Israel walked through the sea on dry ground."
Exodus,15,20,Aaron’s sister Miriam was a prophet. She took a tambourine in her hand. All the women followed her. They played tambourines and danced.
Exodus,15,21,"Miriam sang to them, “Sing to the Lord. He is greatly honored. He has thrown Pharaoh’s horses and chariot drivers into the Red Sea.”"
Exodus,15,22,Then Moses led Israel away from the Red Sea. They went into the Desert of Shur. For three days they traveled in the desert. They didn’t find any water there.
Exodus,15,23,"When they came to Marah, they couldn’t drink its water. It was bitter. That’s why the place is named Marah."
Exodus,15,24,"The people told Moses they weren’t happy with him. They said, “What are we supposed to drink?”"
Exodus,15,25,Then Moses cried out to the Lord . The Lord showed him a stick. Moses threw it into the water. The water became fit to drink. There the Lord gave a ruling and instruction for the people. And there he tested them.
Exodus,15,26,"He said, “I am the Lord your God. Listen carefully to me. Do what is right in my eyes. Pay attention to my commands. Obey all my rules. If you do, I will not send on you any of the sicknesses I sent on the Egyptians. I am the Lord who heals you.”"
Exodus,15,27,The people came to Elim. It had 12 springs and 70 palm trees. They camped there near the water.
Exodus,16,1,The whole community of Israel started out from Elim. They came to the Desert of Sin. It was between Elim and Sinai. They arrived there on the 15th day of the second month after they had come out of Egypt.
Exodus,16,2,In the desert the whole community told Moses and Aaron they weren’t happy with them.
Exodus,16,3,"The Israelites said to them, “We wish the Lord had put us to death in Egypt. There we sat around pots of meat. We ate all the food we wanted. But you have brought us out into this desert. You must want this entire community to die of hunger.”"
Exodus,16,4,"Then the Lord spoke to Moses. He said, “I will rain down bread from heaven for you. The people must go out each day. Have them gather enough bread for that day. Here is how I will test them. I will see if they will follow my directions."
Exodus,16,5,On the sixth day they must prepare what they bring in. On that day they must gather twice as much as on the other days.”
Exodus,16,6,"So Moses and Aaron spoke to all the people of Israel. They said, “In the evening you will know that the Lord brought you out of Egypt."
Exodus,16,7,And in the morning you will see the glory of the Lord . He has heard you say you aren’t happy with him. Who are we? Why are you telling us you aren’t happy with us?”
Exodus,16,8,"Moses also said, “You will know that the Lord has heard you speak against him. He will give you meat to eat in the evening. He’ll give you all the bread you want in the morning. But who are we? You aren’t speaking against us. You are speaking against the Lord .”"
Exodus,16,9,"Then Moses told Aaron, “Talk to the whole community of Israel. Say to them, ‘Come to the Lord . He has heard you speak against him.’ ”"
Exodus,16,10,"While Aaron was talking to the whole community of Israel, they looked toward the desert. There was the glory of the Lord appearing in the cloud!"
Exodus,16,11,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Exodus,16,12,"“I have heard the people of Israel talking about how unhappy they are. Tell them, ‘When the sun goes down, you will eat meat. In the morning you will be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am the Lord your God.’ ”"
Exodus,16,13,That evening quail came and covered the camp. In the morning the ground around the camp was covered with dew.
Exodus,16,14,"When the dew was gone, thin flakes appeared on the desert floor. They looked like frost on the ground."
Exodus,16,15,"The people of Israel saw the flakes. They asked each other, “What’s that?” They didn’t know what it was. Moses said to them, “It’s the bread the Lord has given you to eat."
Exodus,16,16,"Here is what the Lord has commanded. He has said, ‘Everyone should gather as much as they need. Take three pounds for each person who lives in your tent.’ ”"
Exodus,16,17,"The people of Israel did as they were told. Some gathered a lot, and some gathered a little."
Exodus,16,18,"When they measured it out, the one who gathered a lot didn’t have too much. And the one who gathered a little had enough. Everyone gathered only what they needed."
Exodus,16,19,"Then Moses said to them, “Don’t keep any of it until morning.”"
Exodus,16,20,Some of them didn’t pay any attention to Moses. They kept part of it until morning. But it was full of maggots and began to stink. So Moses became angry with them.
Exodus,16,21,"Each morning everyone gathered as much as they needed. But by the hottest time of the day, the thin flakes had melted away."
Exodus,16,22,"On the sixth day, the people gathered twice as much. It amounted to six pounds for each person. The leaders of the community came and reported that to Moses."
Exodus,16,23,"He said to them, “Here is what the Lord commanded. He said, ‘Tomorrow will be a day of rest. It will be a holy Sabbath day. It will be set apart for the Lord . So bake what you want to bake. Boil what you want to boil. Save what is left. Keep it until morning.’ ”"
Exodus,16,24,"So they saved it until morning, just as Moses commanded. It didn’t stink or get maggots in it."
Exodus,16,25,"“Eat it today,” Moses said. “Today is a Sabbath day to honor the Lord . You won’t find any flakes on the ground today."
Exodus,16,26,Gather them for six days. But on the seventh day there won’t be any. It’s the Sabbath day.”
Exodus,16,27,"In spite of what Moses said, some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather the flakes. But they didn’t find any."
Exodus,16,28,"Then the Lord spoke to Moses. He said, “How long will all of you refuse to obey my commands and my teachings?"
Exodus,16,29,Keep in mind that I have given you the Sabbath day. That is why on the sixth day I give you bread for two days. Everyone must stay where they are on the seventh day. No one can go out.”
Exodus,16,30,So the people rested on the seventh day.
Exodus,16,31,The people of Israel called the bread manna. It was white like coriander seeds. It tasted like wafers made with honey.
Exodus,16,32,"Moses said, “Here is what the Lord has commanded. He has said, ‘Get three pounds of manna. Keep it for all time to come. Then those who live after you will see the bread I gave you to eat in the desert. I gave it to you when I brought you out of Egypt.’ ”"
Exodus,16,33,"So Moses said to Aaron, “Get a jar. Put three pounds of manna in it. Then place it in front of the Lord . Keep it there for all time to come.”"
Exodus,16,34,Aaron did exactly as the Lord had commanded Moses. He put the manna with the tablets of the covenant law. He put it there so it would be kept for all time to come.
Exodus,16,35,The Israelites ate manna for 40 years. They ate it until they came to a land where people were living. They ate it until they reached the border of Canaan.
Exodus,16,36,The jar had three pounds of manna in it.
Exodus,17,1,"The whole community of Israel started out from the Desert of Sin. They traveled from place to place, just as the Lord commanded. They camped at Rephidim. But there wasn’t any water for the people to drink."
Exodus,17,2,"So they argued with Moses. They said, “Give us water to drink.” Moses replied, “Why are you arguing with me? Why are you testing the Lord ?”"
Exodus,17,3,"But the people were thirsty for water there. So they told Moses they weren’t happy with him. They said, “Why did you bring us up out of Egypt? Did you want us, our children and our livestock to die of thirst?”"
Exodus,17,4,"Then Moses cried out to the Lord . He said, “What am I going to do with these people? They are almost ready to kill me by throwing stones at me.”"
Exodus,17,5,The Lord answered Moses. “Go out in front of the people. Take some of the elders of Israel along with you. Take in your hand the walking stick you used when you struck the Nile River. Go.
Exodus,17,6,I will stand there in front of you by the rock at Mount Horeb. Hit the rock. Then water will come out of it for the people to drink.” So Moses hit the rock while the elders of Israel watched.
Exodus,17,7,"Moses called the place Massah and Meribah. That’s because the people of Israel argued with him there. They also tested the Lord . They asked, “Is the Lord among us or not?”"
Exodus,17,8,The Amalekites came and attacked the Israelites at Rephidim.
Exodus,17,9,"Moses said to Joshua, “Choose some of our men. Then go out and fight against the Amalekites. Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill. I’ll stand there holding the walking stick God gave me.”"
Exodus,17,10,"So Joshua fought against the Amalekites, just as Moses had ordered. Moses, Aaron and Hur went to the top of the hill."
Exodus,17,11,"As long as Moses held up his hand, the Israelites were winning. But every time he lowered his hands, the Amalekites began to win."
Exodus,17,12,"When Moses’ arms got tired, Aaron and Hur got a stone and put it under him. Then he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held up his hands. Aaron was on one side, and Hur was on the other. Moses’ hands remained steady until sunset."
Exodus,17,13,So Joshua destroyed the Amalekite army with swords.
Exodus,17,14,"Then the Lord said to Moses, “This is something to be remembered. So write it on a scroll. Make sure Joshua knows you have done it. I will completely erase the memory of the Amalekites from the earth.”"
Exodus,17,15,Then Moses built an altar. He called it The Lord Is My Banner.
Exodus,17,16,"He said, “The Amalekites opposed the authority of the Lord . So the Lord will fight against the Amalekites for all time to come.”"
Exodus,18,1,Moses’ father-in-law Jethro was the priest of Midian. He heard about everything God had done for Moses and for his people Israel. Jethro heard how the Lord had brought Israel out of Egypt.
Exodus,18,2,Moses had sent his wife Zipporah to his father-in-law. So Jethro welcomed her
Exodus,18,3,"and her two sons. One son was named Gershom. That’s because Moses had said, “I’m an outsider in a strange land.”"
Exodus,18,4,"The other was named Eliezer. That’s because Moses had said, “My father’s God helped me. He saved me from Pharaoh’s sword.”"
Exodus,18,5,Moses’ father-in-law Jethro came to Moses in the desert. Moses’ sons and wife came with Jethro. Moses was camped near the mountain of God.
Exodus,18,6,"Jethro had sent a message to him. It said, “I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you. I’m bringing your wife and her two sons.”"
Exodus,18,7,So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law. Moses bowed down and kissed him. They greeted each other. Then they went into the tent.
Exodus,18,8,Moses told Jethro everything the Lord had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians. The Lord did all of this because of how much he loved Israel. Moses told Jethro about all their hard times along the way. He told him about how the Lord had saved them.
Exodus,18,9,Jethro was delighted to hear about all the good things the Lord had done for Israel. He heard about how God had saved them from the power of the Egyptians.
Exodus,18,10,"He said, “I praise the Lord . He saved you and your people from the power of the Egyptians and of Pharaoh."
Exodus,18,11,Now I know that the Lord is greater than all other gods. See what he did to those who looked down on Israel.”
Exodus,18,12,Then Moses’ father-in-law Jethro brought a burnt offering and other sacrifices to God. Aaron came with all the elders of Israel. They ate a meal with Moses’ father-in-law in the sight of God.
Exodus,18,13,The next day Moses took his seat to serve the people as their judge. They stood around him from morning until evening.
Exodus,18,14,"His father-in-law saw everything Moses was doing for the people. So he said, “Aren’t you trying to do too much for the people? You are the only judge. And all these people are standing around you from morning until evening.”"
Exodus,18,15,"Moses answered, “The people come to me to find out what God wants them to do."
Exodus,18,16,"Anytime they don’t agree with one another, they come to me. I decide between them. I tell them about God’s rules and instructions.”"
Exodus,18,17,"Moses’ father-in-law replied, “What you are doing isn’t good."
Exodus,18,18,You will just get worn out. And so will these people who come to you. There’s too much work for you. You can’t possibly handle it by yourself.
Exodus,18,19,"Listen to me. I’ll give you some advice, and may God be with you. You must speak to God for the people. Take their problems to him."
Exodus,18,20,Teach them his rules and instructions. Show them how to live and what to do.
Exodus,18,21,"But choose men of ability from all the people. They must have respect for God. You must be able to trust them. They must not try to get money by cheating others. Appoint them as officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens."
Exodus,18,22,Let them serve the people as judges. But have them bring every hard case to you. They can decide the easy ones themselves. That will make your load lighter. They will share it with you.
Exodus,18,23,"If this is what God wants and if you do it, then you will be able to carry the load. And all these people will go home satisfied.”"
Exodus,18,24,Moses listened to his father-in-law. He did everything Jethro said.
Exodus,18,25,"He chose men of ability from the whole community of Israel. He made them leaders of the people. They became officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens."
Exodus,18,26,They judged the people at all times. They brought the hard cases to Moses. But they decided the easy ones themselves.
Exodus,18,27,Moses sent his father-in-law on his way. So Jethro returned to his own country.
Exodus,19,1,"Exactly three months after the people of Israel left Egypt, they came to the Desert of Sinai."
Exodus,19,2,"After they started out from Rephidim, they entered the Desert of Sinai. They camped there in the desert in front of the mountain."
Exodus,19,3,"Then Moses went up to God. The Lord called out to him from the mountain. He said, “Here is what I want you to say to my people, who belong to Jacob’s family. Tell the Israelites,"
Exodus,19,4,‘You have seen for yourselves what I did to Egypt. You saw how I carried you on the wings of eagles and brought you to myself.
Exodus,19,5,"Now obey me completely. Keep my covenant. If you do, then out of all the nations you will be my special treasure. The whole earth is mine."
Exodus,19,6,But you will be a kingdom of priests to serve me. You will be my holy nation.’ That is what you must tell the Israelites.”
Exodus,19,7,So Moses went back. He sent for the elders of the people. He explained to them everything the Lord had commanded him to say.
Exodus,19,8,"All the people answered together. They said, “We will do everything the Lord has said.” So Moses brought their answer back to the Lord."
Exodus,19,9,"The Lord spoke to Moses. He said, “I am going to come to you in a thick cloud. The people will hear me speaking with you. They will always put their trust in you.” Then Moses told the Lord what the people had said."
Exodus,19,10,"The Lord said to Moses, “Go to the people. Today and tomorrow set them apart for me. Have them wash their clothes."
Exodus,19,11,Have the people ready by the third day. On that day the Lord will come down on Mount Sinai. Everyone will see it.
Exodus,19,12,"Put limits for the people around the mountain. Tell them, ‘Be careful that you do not go near the mountain. Do not even touch the foot of it. Whoever touches the mountain must be put to death."
Exodus,19,13,"Do not lay a hand on any of them. Kill them with stones or shoot them with arrows. Whether they are people or animals, do not let them live.’ They may go near the mountain only when the ram’s horn gives out a long blast.”"
Exodus,19,14,"Moses went down the mountain to the people. After he set them apart for the Lord , they washed their clothes."
Exodus,19,15,"Then he spoke to the people. He said, “Get ready for the third day. Don’t have sex.”"
Exodus,19,16,On the morning of the third day there was thunder and lightning. A thick cloud covered the mountain. A trumpet gave out a very loud blast. Everyone in the camp trembled with fear.
Exodus,19,17,Then Moses led the people out of the camp to meet with God. They stood at the foot of the mountain.
Exodus,19,18,"Smoke covered Mount Sinai, because the Lord came down on it in fire. The smoke rose up from it like smoke from a furnace. The whole mountain trembled and shook."
Exodus,19,19,The sound of the trumpet got louder and louder. Then Moses spoke. And the voice of God answered him.
Exodus,19,20,The Lord came down to the top of Mount Sinai. He told Moses to come to the top of the mountain. So Moses went up.
Exodus,19,21,"The Lord said to him, “Go down and warn the people. They must not force their way through to see the Lord . If they do, many of them will die."
Exodus,19,22,"The priests approach the Lord when they serve him. But even they must set themselves apart for the Lord . If they do not, his anger will break out against them.”"
Exodus,19,23,"Moses said to the Lord , “The people can’t come up Mount Sinai. You yourself warned us. You said, ‘Put limits around the mountain. Set it apart as holy.’ ”"
Exodus,19,24,"The Lord replied, “Go down. Bring Aaron up with you. But the priests and the people must not force their way through. They must not come up to the Lord . If they do, his anger will break out against them.”"
Exodus,19,25,So Moses went down to the people and told them.
Exodus,20,1,"Here are all the words God spoke. He said,"
Exodus,20,2,“I am the Lord your God. I brought you out of Egypt. That is the land where you were slaves.
Exodus,20,3,“Do not put any other gods in place of me.
Exodus,20,4,“Do not make for yourself statues of gods that look like anything in the sky. They may not look like anything on the earth or in the waters either.
Exodus,20,5,"Do not bow down to them or worship them. I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God. I cause the sins of the parents to affect their children. I will cause the sins of those who hate me to affect even their grandchildren and great-grandchildren."
Exodus,20,6,But for all time to come I show love to all those who love me and keep my commandments.
Exodus,20,7,“Do not misuse the name of the Lord your God. The Lord will find guilty anyone who misuses his name.
Exodus,20,8,“Remember to keep the Sabbath day holy.
Exodus,20,9,Do all your work in six days.
Exodus,20,10,"But the seventh day is a sabbath to honor the Lord your God. Do not do any work on that day. The same command applies to your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, and your animals. It also applies to any outsiders who live in your towns."
Exodus,20,11,"In six days the Lord made the heavens, the earth, the sea and everything in them. But he rested on the seventh day. So the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy."
Exodus,20,12,“Honor your father and mother. Then you will live a long time in the land the Lord your God is giving you.
Exodus,20,13,“Do not murder.
Exodus,20,14,“Do not commit adultery.
Exodus,20,15,“Do not steal.
Exodus,20,16,“Do not be a false witness against your neighbor.
Exodus,20,17,"“Do not want to have anything your neighbor owns. Do not want to have your neighbor’s house, wife, male or female servant, ox or donkey.”"
Exodus,20,18,The people saw the thunder and lightning. They heard the trumpet. They saw the mountain covered with smoke. They trembled with fear and stayed a long way off.
Exodus,20,19,"They said to Moses, “Speak to us yourself. Then we’ll listen. But don’t let God speak to us. If he does, we’ll die.”"
Exodus,20,20,"Moses said to the people, “Don’t be afraid. God has come to test you. He wants you to have respect for him. That will keep you from sinning.”"
Exodus,20,21,Moses approached the thick darkness where God was. But the people remained a long way off.
Exodus,20,22,"Then the Lord said to Moses, “Here is what you must tell the people of Israel. Say to them, ‘You have seen for yourselves what I said to you from heaven."
Exodus,20,23,Do not put any other gods in place of me. Do not make silver or gold statues of them for yourselves.
Exodus,20,24,"“ ‘Make an altar out of dirt for me. Sacrifice your burnt offerings and friendship offerings on it. Sacrifice your sheep, goats and cattle on it. I will come to you and bless you everywhere I cause my name to be honored."
Exodus,20,25,"If you make an altar out of stones to honor me, do not build it with blocks of stone. You will make it “unclean” if you use a tool on it."
Exodus,20,26,"Do not walk up steps to my altar. If you do, someone might see your naked body under your robes.’"
Exodus,21,1,“Here are the laws you must explain to the people of Israel.
Exodus,21,2,"“Suppose you buy a Hebrew servant. He must serve you for six years. But in the seventh year, you must set him free. He does not have to pay anything."
Exodus,21,3,"If he does not have a wife when he comes, he must go free alone. But if he has a wife when he comes, she must go with him."
Exodus,21,4,Suppose his master gives him a wife. And suppose she has sons or daughters by him. Then only the man will go free. The woman and her children will belong to her master.
Exodus,21,5,"“But suppose the servant says, ‘I love my master and my wife and children. I don’t want to go free.’"
Exodus,21,6,Then his master must take him to the judges. His master must take him to the door or doorpost of his master’s house. His master must poke a hole through his servant’s earlobe into the door or doorpost. Then he will become his servant for life.
Exodus,21,7,“Suppose a man sells his daughter as a servant. Then she can’t go free as male servants do.
Exodus,21,8,But what if the master who has chosen her does not like her? Then he must let the man buy her back. He has no right to sell her to strangers. He has broken his promise to her.
Exodus,21,9,What if he chooses her to marry his son? Then he must grant her the rights of a daughter.
Exodus,21,10,What if her master marries another woman? He must still give the first one her food and clothes and sleep with her.
Exodus,21,11,"If he does not provide her with those three things, she can go free. She does not have to pay anything."
Exodus,21,12,“Anyone who hits and kills someone else must be put to death.
Exodus,21,13,Suppose they did not do it on purpose. Suppose I let it happen. Then they can escape to a place I will choose.
Exodus,21,14,But suppose they kill someone on purpose. Then take them away from my altar and put them to death.
Exodus,21,15,“Anyone who attacks their father or mother must be put to death.
Exodus,21,16,"“Anyone who kidnaps and sells another person must be put to death. If they still have the person with them when they are caught, they must be put to death."
Exodus,21,17,“Anyone who asks for something bad to happen to their father or mother must be put to death.
Exodus,21,18,“Suppose two people get into a fight and argue with each other. One hits the other with a stone or his fist. And the person who was hit does not die but has to stay in bed.
Exodus,21,19,And later that person gets up and walks around outside with a walking stick. Then the person who hit the other person will not be held responsible. But that person must pay the one who was hurt for the time spent in bed. The one who hit the other person must be sure that person is completely healed.
Exodus,21,20,“Suppose a person beats their male or female slave to death with a club. That person must be punished.
Exodus,21,21,"But they will not be punished if the slave gets up after a day or two. After all, the slave is their property."
Exodus,21,22,“Suppose some people are fighting and one of them hits a pregnant woman. And suppose she has her baby early but is not badly hurt. Then the one who hurt her must pay a fine. That person must pay what the woman’s husband asks for and the court allows.
Exodus,21,23,"But if someone is badly hurt, a life must be taken for a life."
Exodus,21,24,An eye must be put out for an eye. A tooth must be knocked out for a tooth. A hand must be cut off for a hand and a foot for a foot.
Exodus,21,25,"A burn must be given for a burn, a wound for a wound, and a bruise for a bruise."
Exodus,21,26,“Suppose an owner hits a male or female slave in the eye and destroys it. Then the owner must let the slave go free to pay for the eye.
Exodus,21,27,Suppose an owner knocks out the tooth of a male or female slave. Then he must let the slave go free to pay for the tooth.
Exodus,21,28,“Suppose a bull kills a man or woman with its horns. Then you must kill the bull by throwing stones at it. Its meat must not be eaten. But the owner of the bull will not be held accountable.
Exodus,21,29,"But suppose the bull has had the habit of attacking people. And suppose the owner has been warned but has not kept it fenced in. Then if it kills a man or woman, you must kill it with stones. The owner must also be put to death."
Exodus,21,30,But suppose payment is required of him instead. Then the owner can save his life by paying what is required.
Exodus,21,31,The same law applies if the bull wounds a son or daughter with its horns.
Exodus,21,32,Suppose the bull wounds a male or female slave. Then the owner must pay the slave’s master about 12 ounces of silver. You must kill the bull with stones.

Exodus,31,18,The Lord finished speaking to Moses on Mount Sinai. Then he gave him the two tablets of the covenant law. They were made out of stone. The words on them were written by the finger of God.
Exodus,32,1,"The people saw that Moses took a long time to come down from the mountain. So they gathered around Aaron. They said to him, “Come. Make us a god that will lead us. This fellow Moses brought us up out of Egypt. But we don’t know what has happened to him.”"
Exodus,32,2,"Aaron answered them, “Take the gold earrings off your wives, your sons and your daughters. Bring the earrings to me.”"
Exodus,32,3,So all the people took off their earrings. They brought them to Aaron.
Exodus,32,4,"He took what they gave him and made it into a metal statue of a god. It looked like a calf. Aaron shaped it with a tool. Then the people said, “Israel, here is your god who brought you up out of Egypt.”"
Exodus,32,5,"When Aaron saw what they were doing, he built an altar in front of the calf. He said, “Tomorrow will be a feast day to honor the Lord .”"
Exodus,32,6,So the next day the people got up early. They sacrificed burnt offerings and brought friendship offerings. They sat down to eat and drink. Then they got up to dance wildly in front of their god.
Exodus,32,7,"The Lord spoke to Moses. He said, “Go down. Your people you brought up out of Egypt have become very sinful."
Exodus,32,8,"They have quickly turned away from what I commanded them. They have made themselves a metal statue of a god in the shape of a calf. They have bowed down and sacrificed to it. And they have said, ‘Israel, here is your god who brought you up out of Egypt.’"
Exodus,32,9,"“I have seen these people,” the Lord said to Moses. “They are stubborn."
Exodus,32,10,Now leave me alone. I will destroy them because of my great anger. Then I will make you into a great nation.”
Exodus,32,11,"But Moses asked the Lord his God to have mercy on the people. “ Lord ,” he said, “why should you destroy your people in anger? You used your great power and mighty hand to bring them out of Egypt."
Exodus,32,12,"Why should the Egyptians say, ‘He brought them out to hurt them. He wanted to kill them in the mountains. He wanted to wipe them off the face of the earth’? Turn away from your great anger. Please take pity on your people. Don’t destroy them!"
Exodus,32,13,"Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Israel. You made a promise to them in your own name. You said, ‘I will make your children after you as many as the stars in the sky. I will give them all this land I promised them. It will belong to them forever.’ ”"
Exodus,32,14,Then the Lord took pity on his people. He didn’t destroy them as he had said he would.
Exodus,32,15,"Moses turned and went down the mountain. He had the two tablets of the covenant law in his hands. Words were written on both sides of the tablets, front and back."
Exodus,32,16,The tablets were the work of God. The words had been written by God. They had been carved on the tablets.
Exodus,32,17,"Joshua heard the noise of the people shouting. So he said to Moses, “It sounds like war in the camp.”"
Exodus,32,18,"Moses replied, “It’s not the sound of winning. It’s not the sound of losing. It’s the sound of singing that I hear.”"
Exodus,32,19,"As Moses approached the camp, he saw the calf. He also saw the people dancing. So he was very angry. He threw the tablets out of his hands. They broke into pieces at the foot of the mountain."
Exodus,32,20,He took the calf the people had made. He burned it in the fire. Then he ground it into powder. He scattered it on the water. And he made the Israelites drink it.
Exodus,32,21,"He said to Aaron, “What did these people do to you? How did they make you lead them into such terrible sin?”"
Exodus,32,22,"“Please don’t be angry,” Aaron answered. “You know how these people like to do what is evil."
Exodus,32,23,"They said to me, ‘Make us a god that will lead us. This fellow Moses brought us up out of Egypt. But we don’t know what has happened to him.’"
Exodus,32,24,"So I told them, ‘Anyone who has any gold jewelry, take it off.’ They gave me the gold. I threw it into the fire. And out came this calf!”"
Exodus,32,25,Moses saw that the people were running wild. Aaron had let them get out of control. The people had become a joke to their enemies.
Exodus,32,26,"Moses stood at the entrance to the camp. He said, “Anyone on the Lord ’s side, come to me.” All the Levites joined him."
Exodus,32,27,"Then he spoke to them. He said, “The Lord , the God of Israel, says, ‘Each man must put on his sword. Then he must go back and forth through the camp from one end to the other. Each man must kill his brother and friend and neighbor.’ ”"
Exodus,32,28,"The Levites did as Moses commanded. About 3,000 of the people died that day."
Exodus,32,29,"Then Moses said to the Levites, “You have been set apart for the Lord today. You fought against your own sons and brothers. And he has blessed you this day.”"
Exodus,32,30,"The next day Moses said to the people, “You have committed a terrible sin. But now I will go up to the Lord . Maybe if I pray to him, he will forgive your sin.”"
Exodus,32,31,"So Moses went back to the Lord . He said, “These people have committed a terrible sin. They have made a god out of gold for themselves."
Exodus,32,32,"Now please forgive their sin. But if you won’t, then erase my name out of the book you have written.”"
Exodus,32,33,"The Lord replied to Moses. The Lord said, “I will erase out of my book only the names of those who have sinned against me."
Exodus,32,34,"Now go. Lead the people to the place I spoke about. My angel will go ahead of you. But when the time comes for me to punish, I will punish them for their sin.”"
Exodus,32,35,The Lord struck the people with a plague. That’s because of what they did with the calf Aaron had made.
Exodus,33,1,"Then the Lord said to Moses, “Leave this place. You and the people you brought up out of Egypt must leave it. Go up to the land I promised to give to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. I said to them, ‘I will give it to your children after you.’"
Exodus,33,2,"I will send an angel ahead of you. I will drive out the Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites."
Exodus,33,3,Go up to the land that has plenty of milk and honey. But I will not go with you. You are stubborn. I might destroy you on the way.”
Exodus,33,4,"When the people heard these painful words, they began to mourn. No one put on any jewelry."
Exodus,33,5,"The Lord had said to Moses, “Tell the Israelites, ‘You are stubborn. If I went with you even for a moment, I might destroy you. Now take off your jewelry. Then I will decide what to do with you.’ ”"
Exodus,33,6,So the people took off their jewelry at Mount Horeb.
Exodus,33,7,Moses used to take a tent and set it up far outside the camp. He called it the “tent of meeting.” Anyone who wanted to ask the Lord a question would go to the tent of meeting outside the camp.
Exodus,33,8,"When Moses would go out to the tent, everyone would get up and stand at the entrances to their tents. They would watch Moses until he entered the tent."
Exodus,33,9,"As Moses would go into the tent, the pillar of cloud would come down. It would stay at the entrance while the Lord spoke with Moses."
Exodus,33,10,The people would see the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance to the tent. Then all of them would stand and worship at the entrances to their tents.
Exodus,33,11,"The Lord would speak to Moses face to face like one would speak to a friend. Then Moses would return to the camp. But Joshua, his young helper, didn’t leave the tent. Joshua was the son of Nun."
Exodus,33,12,"Moses said to the Lord , “You have been telling me, ‘Lead these people.’ But you haven’t let me know whom you will send with me. You have said, ‘I know your name. I know all about you. And I am pleased with you.’"
Exodus,33,13,"If you are pleased with me, teach me more about yourself. Then I can know you. And I can continue to please you. Remember that this nation is your people.”"
Exodus,33,14,"The Lord replied, “I will go with you. And I will give you rest.”"
Exodus,33,15,"Then Moses said to him, “If you don’t go with us, don’t send us up from here."
Exodus,33,16,How will anyone know that you are pleased with me and your people? You must go with us. How else will we be different from all the other people on the face of the earth?”
Exodus,33,17,"The Lord said to Moses, “I will do exactly what you have asked. I am pleased with you. And I know your name. I know all about you.”"
Exodus,33,18,"Then Moses said, “Now show me your glory.”"
Exodus,33,19,"The Lord said, “I will make all my goodness pass in front of you. And I will announce my name, the Lord , in front of you. I will have mercy on whom I have mercy. And I will show love to those I love."
Exodus,33,20,"But you can’t see my face,” he said. “No one can see me and stay alive.”"
Exodus,33,21,"The Lord continued, “There is a place near me where you can stand on a rock."
Exodus,33,22,"When my glory passes by, I will put you in an opening in the rock. I will cover you with my hand until I have passed by."
Exodus,33,23,Then I will remove my hand. You will see my back. But my face must not be seen.”
Exodus,34,1,"The Lord said to Moses, “Cut out two stone tablets that are just like the first ones. I will write on them the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke."
Exodus,34,2,Be ready in the morning. Then come up on Mount Sinai. Meet with me there on top of the mountain.
Exodus,34,3,No one must come with you. No one must be seen anywhere on the mountain. Not even the flocks and herds must be allowed to eat grass in front of the mountain.”
Exodus,34,4,So Moses carved out two stone tablets just like the first ones. Early in the morning he went up Mount Sinai. He carried the two stone tablets in his hands. He did as the Lord had commanded him to do.
Exodus,34,5,"Then the Lord came down in the cloud. He stood there with Moses and announced his name, the Lord."
Exodus,34,6,"As he passed in front of Moses, he called out. He said, “I am the Lord , the Lord . I am the God who is tender and kind. I am gracious. I am slow to get angry. I am faithful and full of love."
Exodus,34,7,"I continue to show my love to thousands of people. I forgive those who do evil. I forgive those who refuse to obey me. And I forgive those who sin. But I do not let guilty people go without punishing them. I cause the sins of the parents to affect their children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.”"
Exodus,34,8,Moses bowed down to the ground at once and worshiped.
Exodus,34,9,"“Lord,” he said, “if you are pleased with me, then go with us. Even though these people are stubborn, forgive the evil things we have done. Forgive our sin. And accept us as your people.”"
Exodus,34,10,"Then the Lord said, “I am making a covenant with you. I will do wonderful things in front of all your people. I will do amazing things that have never been done before in any nation in the whole world. The people you live among will see the things that I, the Lord , will do for you. And they will see how wonderful those things really are."
Exodus,34,11,"Obey what I command you today. I will drive out the Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites to make room for you."
Exodus,34,12,Be careful. Do not make a peace treaty with those who live in the land where you are going. They will be a trap to you.
Exodus,34,13,Break down their altars. Smash their sacred stones. Cut down the poles they use to worship the female god named Asherah.
Exodus,34,14,"Do not worship any other god. The Lord is a jealous God. In fact, his name is Jealous."
Exodus,34,15,"“Be careful not to make a peace treaty with the people living in the land. They commit sin by offering sacrifices to their gods. They will invite you to eat their sacrifices, and you will do it."
Exodus,34,16,You will choose some of their daughters as wives for your sons. And those daughters will commit sin by worshiping their gods. Then they will lead your sons to do the same thing.
Exodus,34,17,“Do not make any statues of gods.
Exodus,34,18,"“Celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread. For seven days eat bread made without yeast, just as I commanded you. Do it at the appointed time in the month of Aviv. You came out of Egypt in that month."
