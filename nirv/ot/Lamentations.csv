Lamentations,1,1,The city of Jerusalem is so empty! She used to be full of people. But now she’s like a woman whose husband has died. She used to be great among the nations. She was like a queen among the kingdoms. But now she is a slave.
Lamentations,1,2,Jerusalem weeps bitterly at night. Tears run down her cheeks. None of her friends comforts her. All those who were going to help her have turned against her. They have become her enemies.
Lamentations,1,3,"After Judah’s people had suffered greatly, they were taken away as prisoners. Now they live among the nations. They can’t find any place to rest. All those who were chasing them have caught up with them. And they can’t get away."
Lamentations,1,4,The roads to Zion are empty. No one travels to her appointed feasts. All the public places near her gates are deserted. Her priests groan. Her young women are sad. And Zion herself weeps bitterly.
Lamentations,1,5,Her enemies have become her masters. They have an easy life. The Lord has brought suffering to Jerusalem because her people have committed so many sins. Her children have been taken away as prisoners. Her enemies have forced her people to leave their homes.
Lamentations,1,6,The city of Zion used to be full of glory. But now her glory has faded away. Her princes are like deer. They can’t find anything to eat. They are almost too weak to get away from those who hunt them down.
Lamentations,1,7,Jerusalem’s people are suffering and wandering. They remember all the treasures they used to have. But they fell into the hands of their enemies. And no one was there to help them. Their enemies looked at them. They laughed because Jerusalem had been destroyed.
Lamentations,1,8,Her people have committed many sins. They have become impure. All those who honored Jerusalem now look down on her. They all look at her as if she were a naked woman. The city groans and turns away in shame.
Lamentations,1,9,"Her skirts are dirty. She didn’t think about how things might turn out. Her fall from power amazed everyone. And no one was there to comfort her. She said, “ Lord , please pay attention to how much I’m suffering. My enemies have won the battle over me.”"
Lamentations,1,10,Jerusalem’s enemies took away all her treasures. Her people saw outsiders enter her temple. The Lord had commanded them not to do that.
Lamentations,1,11,"All Jerusalem’s people groan as they search for bread. They trade their treasures for food just to stay alive. Jerusalem says, “ Lord , look at me. Think about my condition. Everyone looks down on me.”"
Lamentations,1,12,"Jerusalem also says, “All you who are passing by, don’t you care about what has happened to me? Just look at my condition. Has anyone suffered the way I have? The Lord has brought all this on me. He has made me suffer. His anger has burned against me."
Lamentations,1,13,“He sent down fire from heaven. It went deep down into my bones. He spread a net to catch me by the feet. He stopped me right where I was. He made me empty. I am sick all the time.
Lamentations,1,14,“My sins have been made into a heavy yoke. They were woven together by his hands. They have been placed on my neck. The Lord has taken away my strength. He has handed me over to my enemies. I can’t win the battle over them.
Lamentations,1,15,"“The Lord has refused to accept any of my soldiers. He has sent for an army to crush my young men. I am like grapes in the Lord’s winepress. He has stomped on me, even though I am his very own."
Lamentations,1,16,“That’s why I am weeping. Tears are flowing from my eyes. No one is near to comfort me. No one can heal my spirit. My children don’t have anything. My enemies are much too strong for me.”
Lamentations,1,17,Zion reaches out her hands. But no one is there to comfort her people. The Lord has ordered that the neighbors of Jacob’s people would become their enemies. Jerusalem has become impure among them.
Lamentations,1,18,"Jerusalem says, “The Lord always does what is right. But I refused to obey his commands. Listen, all you nations. Pay attention to how much I’m suffering. My young men and women have been taken away as prisoners."
Lamentations,1,19,“I called out to those who were going to help me. But they turned against me. My priests and elders died in the city. They were searching for food just to stay alive.
Lamentations,1,20,"“ Lord , see how upset I am! I am suffering deep down inside. My heart is troubled. Again and again I have refused to obey you. Outside the city, people are being killed by swords. Inside, there is nothing but death."
Lamentations,1,21,"“People have heard me groan. But no one is here to comfort me. My enemies have heard about all my troubles. What you have done makes them happy. So please judge them, just as you said you would. Let them become like me."
Lamentations,1,22,“Please pay attention to all their sinful ways. Punish them as you have punished me. You judged me because I had committed so many sins. I groan all the time. And my heart is weak.”
Lamentations,2,1,"See how the Lord covered the city of Zion with the cloud of his anger! He threw Israel’s glory down from heaven to earth. When he was angry, he turned his back on his own city."
Lamentations,2,2,"Without pity the Lord swallowed up all the homes of Jacob’s people. When he was angry, he tore down the forts of the people of Judah. He brought down their kingdom and princes to the ground in dishonor."
Lamentations,2,3,"When he was very angry, he took away Israel’s power. He pulled back his powerful right hand as the enemy approached. His burning anger blazed out in Jacob’s land. It burned up everything near it."
Lamentations,2,4,Like an enemy the Lord got his bow ready to use. He had a sword in his right hand. Like an enemy he destroyed everything that used to be pleasing to him. His anger blazed out like fire. It burned up the homes in the city of Zion.
Lamentations,2,5,The Lord was like an enemy. He swallowed up Israel. He swallowed up all of its palaces. He destroyed its forts. He filled the people of Judah with sorrow and sadness.
Lamentations,2,6,"The Lord ’s temple was like a garden. But he completely destroyed it. He destroyed the place where he used to meet with his people. He made Zion’s people forget their appointed feasts and Sabbath days. When he was very angry, he turned his back on king and priest alike."
Lamentations,2,7,The Lord deserted his altar. He left his temple. He gave the walls of Jerusalem’s palaces into the hands of her enemies. They shouted loudly in the house of the Lord. You would have thought it was the day of an appointed feast.
Lamentations,2,8,The Lord decided to tear down the walls around the city of Zion. He measured out what he wanted to destroy. Then he destroyed Jerusalem by his power. He made even her towers and walls sing songs of sadness. All of them fell down.
Lamentations,2,9,"Her gates sank down into the ground. He broke the metal bars that locked her gates, and he destroyed them. Her king and princes were taken away to other nations. There is no law anymore. Jerusalem’s prophets no longer receive visions from the Lord."
Lamentations,2,10,The elders of the city of Zion sit silently on the ground. They have sprinkled dust on their heads. They’ve put on the clothes of sadness. The young women of Jerusalem have bowed their heads toward the ground.
Lamentations,2,11,I’ve cried so much I can’t see very well. I’m suffering deep down inside. My heart is broken because my people are destroyed. Children and babies are fainting in the streets of the city.
Lamentations,2,12,"They say to their mothers, “Where can we find something to eat and drink?” They faint like wounded soldiers in the streets of the city. Their lives are slipping away in their mothers’ arms."
Lamentations,2,13,"City of Jerusalem, what can I say about you? What can I compare you to? People of Zion, what are you like? I want to comfort you. Your wound is as deep as the ocean. Who can heal you?"
Lamentations,2,14,The visions of your prophets were lies. They weren’t worth anything. They didn’t show you the sins you had committed. So that’s why you were captured. The messages they gave you were lies. They led you astray.
Lamentations,2,15,"All those who pass by clap their hands and make fun of you. They laugh at you and shake their heads at the city of Jerusalem. They say, “Could that be the city that was called perfect and beautiful? Is that the city that brought joy to everyone on earth?”"
Lamentations,2,16,"All your enemies open their mouths wide against you. They laugh at you and grind their teeth. They say, “We have swallowed up Jerusalem’s people. This is the day we’ve waited for. And we’ve lived to see it.”"
Lamentations,2,17,The Lord has done what he planned to do. He has made what he said come true. He gave the command long ago. He has destroyed you without pity. He has let your enemies laugh at you. He has made them stronger than you are.
Lamentations,2,18,"People in the city of Zion, cry out from your heart to the Lord. Let your tears flow like a river day and night. Don’t stop at all. Don’t give your eyes any rest."
Lamentations,2,19,Get up. Cry out as the night begins. Tell the Lord all your troubles. Lift up your hands to him. Pray that the lives of your children will be spared. At every street corner they faint because they are so hungry.
Lamentations,2,20,"Jerusalem says, “ Lord , look at me. Think about my condition. Have you ever treated anyone else like this? Should women have to eat their babies? Should they eat the children they’ve taken care of? Should priests and prophets be killed in your own temple?"
Lamentations,2,21,“Young people and old people alike lie dead in the dust of my streets. My young men and women have been killed by swords. You killed them when you were angry. You put them to death without pity.
Lamentations,2,22,"“You sent for terrors to come against me on every side. It was as if you were inviting people to enjoy a feast day. Because you were angry, no one escaped. No one was left alive. I took good care of my children and brought them up. But my enemies have destroyed them.”"
Lamentations,3,1,I am a man who has suffered greatly. The Lord has used the Babylonians to punish my people.
Lamentations,3,2,He has driven me away. He has made me walk in darkness instead of light.
Lamentations,3,3,"He has turned his powerful hand against me. He has done it again and again, all day long."
Lamentations,3,4,He has worn out my body. He has broken my bones.
Lamentations,3,5,He has surrounded me and attacked me. He has made me suffer bitterly. He has made things hard for me.
Lamentations,3,6,He has made me live in darkness like those who are dead and gone.
Lamentations,3,7,"He has built walls around me, so I can’t escape. He has put heavy chains on me."
Lamentations,3,8,I call out and cry for help. But he won’t listen to me when I pray.
Lamentations,3,9,He has put up a stone wall to block my way. He has made my paths crooked.
Lamentations,3,10,He has been like a bear waiting to attack me. He has been like a lion hiding in the bushes.
Lamentations,3,11,He has dragged me off the path. He has torn me to pieces. And he has left me helpless.
Lamentations,3,12,He has gotten his bow ready to use. He has shot his arrows at me.
Lamentations,3,13,The arrows from his bag have gone through my heart.
Lamentations,3,14,My people laugh at me all the time. They sing and make fun of me all day long.
Lamentations,3,15,The Lord has made my life bitter. He has made me suffer bitterly.
Lamentations,3,16,He made me chew stones that broke my teeth. He has walked all over me in the dust.
Lamentations,3,17,I have lost all hope of ever having any peace. I’ve forgotten what good times are like.
Lamentations,3,18,"So I say, “My glory has faded away. My hope in the Lord is gone.”"
Lamentations,3,19,I remember how I suffered and wandered. I remember how bitter my life was.
Lamentations,3,20,I remember it very well. My spirit is very sad deep down inside me.
Lamentations,3,21,But here is something else I remember. And it gives me hope.
Lamentations,3,22,The Lord loves us very much. So we haven’t been completely destroyed. His loving concern never fails.
Lamentations,3,23,"His great love is new every morning. Lord , how faithful you are!"
Lamentations,3,24,"I say to myself, “The Lord is everything I will ever need. So I will put my hope in him.”"
Lamentations,3,25,The Lord is good to those who put their hope in him. He is good to those who look to him.
Lamentations,3,26,It is good when people wait quietly for the Lord to save them.
Lamentations,3,27,It is good for a man to carry a heavy load of suffering while he is young.
Lamentations,3,28,Let him sit alone and not say anything. The Lord has placed that load on him.
Lamentations,3,29,Let him bury his face in the dust. There might still be hope for him.
Lamentations,3,30,Let him turn his cheek toward those who would slap him. Let him be filled with shame.
Lamentations,3,31,The Lord doesn’t turn his back on people forever.
Lamentations,3,32,He might bring suffering. But he will also show loving concern. How great his faithful love is!
Lamentations,3,33,He doesn’t want to bring pain or suffering to anyone.
Lamentations,3,34,"Every time people crush prisoners under their feet, the Lord knows all about it."
Lamentations,3,35,"When people refuse to give someone what they should, the Most High God knows it."
Lamentations,3,36,"When people don’t treat someone fairly, the Lord knows it."
Lamentations,3,37,Suppose people order something to happen. It won’t happen unless the Lord has planned it.
Lamentations,3,38,Troubles and good things alike come to people because the Most High God has commanded them to come.
Lamentations,3,39,A person who is still alive shouldn’t blame God when God punishes them for their sins.
Lamentations,3,40,Let’s take a good look at the way we’re living. Let’s return to the Lord.
Lamentations,3,41,Let’s lift up our hands to God in heaven. Let’s pray to him with all our hearts.
Lamentations,3,42,"Let’s say, “We have sinned. We’ve refused to obey you. And you haven’t forgiven us."
Lamentations,3,43,“You have covered yourself with the cloud of your anger. You have chased us. You have killed us without pity.
Lamentations,3,44,You have covered yourself with the cloud of your anger. Our prayers can’t get through to you.
Lamentations,3,45,You have made us become like trash and garbage among the nations.
Lamentations,3,46,“All our enemies have opened their mouths wide to swallow us up.
Lamentations,3,47,We are terrified and trapped. We are broken and destroyed.”
Lamentations,3,48,Streams of tears flow from my eyes. That’s because my people are destroyed.
Lamentations,3,49,Tears will never stop flowing from my eyes. My eyes can’t get any rest.
Lamentations,3,50,I’ll weep until the Lord looks down from heaven. I’ll cry until he notices my tears.
Lamentations,3,51,What I see brings pain to my spirit. All the women of my city are mourning.
Lamentations,3,52,Those who were my enemies for no reason at all hunted me down as if I were a bird.
Lamentations,3,53,They tried to end my life by throwing me into a deep pit. They threw stones down at me.
Lamentations,3,54,The water rose and covered my head. I thought I was going to die.
Lamentations,3,55," Lord , I called out to you. I called out from the bottom of the pit."
Lamentations,3,56,"I prayed, “Please don’t close your ears to my cry for help.” And you heard my appeal."
Lamentations,3,57,"You came near when I called out to you. You said, “Do not be afraid.”"
Lamentations,3,58,"Lord, you stood up for me in court. You saved my life and set me free."
Lamentations,3,59," Lord , you have seen the wrong things people have done to me. Stand up for me again!"
Lamentations,3,60,You have seen how my enemies have tried to get even with me. You know all about their plans against me.
Lamentations,3,61," Lord , you have heard them laugh at me. You know all about their plans against me."
Lamentations,3,62,You have heard my enemies whispering among themselves. They speak against me all day long.
Lamentations,3,63,Just look at them sitting and standing there! They sing and make fun of me.
Lamentations,3,64," Lord , pay them back. Punish them for what their hands have done."
Lamentations,3,65,Cover their minds with a veil. Put a curse on them!
Lamentations,3,66," Lord , get angry with them and hunt them down. Wipe them off the face of the earth."
Lamentations,4,1,Look at how the gold has lost its brightness! See how dull the fine gold has become! The sacred jewels are scattered at every street corner.
Lamentations,4,2,The priceless children of Zion were worth their weight in gold. But now they are thought of as clay pots made by the hands of a potter.
Lamentations,4,3,Even wild dogs nurse their young pups. But my people are as mean as ostriches in the desert.
Lamentations,4,4,"When the babies get thirsty, their tongues stick to the roofs of their mouths. When the children beg for bread, no one gives them any."
Lamentations,4,5,Those who once ate fine food are dying in the streets. Those who wore royal clothes are now lying on piles of trash.
Lamentations,4,6,My people have been punished more than Sodom was. It was destroyed in a moment. No one offered it a helping hand.
Lamentations,4,7,Jerusalem’s princes were brighter than snow. They were whiter than milk. Their bodies were redder than rubies. They looked like lapis lazuli.
Lamentations,4,8,But now they are blacker than coal. No one even recognizes them in the streets. Their skin is wrinkled on their bones. It has become as dry as a stick.
Lamentations,4,9,Those killed by swords are better off than those who die of hunger. Those who are hungry waste away to nothing. They don’t have any food from the fields.
Lamentations,4,10,"With their own hands, loving mothers have had to cook even their own children. They ate their children when my people were destroyed."
Lamentations,4,11,The Lord has become very angry. He has poured out his burning anger. He started a fire in Zion. It burned its foundations.
Lamentations,4,12,The kings of the earth couldn’t believe what was happening. Neither could any of the peoples of the world. Enemies actually attacked and entered the gates of Jerusalem.
Lamentations,4,13,It happened because Jerusalem’s prophets had sinned. Her priests had done evil things. All of them spilled the blood of those who did what was right.
Lamentations,4,14,Now those prophets and priests have to feel their way along the streets as if they were blind. The blood of those they killed has made them “unclean.” So no one dares to touch their clothes.
Lamentations,4,15,"“Go away! You are ‘unclean’!” people cry out to them. “Go away! Get out of here! Don’t touch us!” So they run away and wander around. Then people among the nations say, “They can’t stay here anymore.”"
Lamentations,4,16,The Lord himself has scattered them. He doesn’t watch over them anymore. No one shows the priests any respect. No one honors the elders.
Lamentations,4,17,And that’s not all. Our eyes grew tired. We looked for help that never came. We watched from our towers. We kept looking for a nation that couldn’t save us.
Lamentations,4,18,"People hunted us down no matter where we went. We couldn’t even walk in our streets. Our end was near, so we only had a few days to live. Our end had come."
Lamentations,4,19,Those who were hunting us down were faster than eagles in the sky. They chased us over the mountains. They hid and waited for us in the desert.
Lamentations,4,20,"Zedekiah, the Lord ’s anointed king, was our last hope. But he was caught in their traps. We thought he would keep us safe. We expected to continue living among the nations."
Lamentations,4,21,"People of Edom, be joyful. You who live in the land of Uz, be glad. But the cup of the Lord ’s anger will also be passed to you. Then you will become drunk. Your clothes will be stripped off."
Lamentations,4,22,"People of Zion, the time for you to be punished will come to an end. The Lord won’t keep you away from your land any longer. But he will punish your sin, people of Edom. He will show everyone the evil things you have done."
Lamentations,5,1," Lord , think about what has happened to us. Look at the shame our enemies have brought on us."
Lamentations,5,2,The land you gave us has been turned over to outsiders. Our homes have been given to strangers.
Lamentations,5,3,Our fathers have been killed. Our mothers don’t have husbands.
Lamentations,5,4,We have to buy the water we drink. We have to pay for the wood we use.
Lamentations,5,5,Those who chase us are right behind us. We’re tired and can’t get any rest.
Lamentations,5,6,We put ourselves under the control of Egypt and Assyria just to get enough bread.
Lamentations,5,7,Our people of long ago sinned. And they are now dead. We are being punished because of their sins.
Lamentations,5,8,Slaves rule over us. No one can set us free from their power.
Lamentations,5,9,We put our lives in danger just to get some bread to eat. Robbers in the desert might kill us with their swords.
Lamentations,5,10,Our skin is as hot as an oven. We are so hungry we’re burning up with fever.
Lamentations,5,11,Our women have been treated badly in Zion. Our virgins have been treated badly in the towns of Judah.
Lamentations,5,12,Our princes have been hung up by their hands. No one shows our elders any respect.
Lamentations,5,13,Our young men are forced to grind grain at the mill. Our boys almost fall down as they carry heavy loads of wood.
Lamentations,5,14,Our elders don’t go to the city gate anymore. Our young men have stopped playing their music.
Lamentations,5,15,There isn’t any joy in our hearts. Our dancing has turned into mourning.
Lamentations,5,16,All of our honor is gone. How terrible it is for us because we have sinned!
Lamentations,5,17,So our hearts are weak. Our eyes can’t see very clearly.
Lamentations,5,18,Mount Zion has been deserted. Wild dogs are prowling all around on it.
Lamentations,5,19," Lord , you rule forever. Your throne will last for all time to come."
Lamentations,5,20,Why do you always forget us? Why have you deserted us for so long?
Lamentations,5,21," Lord , please bring us back to you. Then we can return. Make our lives like new again."
Lamentations,5,22,Or have you completely turned away from us? Are you really that angry with us?
