Matthew,1,1,This is the written story of the family line of Jesus the Messiah. He is the son of David. He is also the son of Abraham.
Matthew,1,2,Abraham was the father of Isaac. Isaac was the father of Jacob. Jacob was the father of Judah and his brothers.
Matthew,1,3,Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah. Tamar was their mother. Perez was the father of Hezron. Hezron was the father of Ram.
Matthew,1,4,Ram was the father of Amminadab. Amminadab was the father of Nahshon. Nahshon was the father of Salmon.
Matthew,1,5,Salmon was the father of Boaz. Rahab was Boaz’s mother. Boaz was the father of Obed. Ruth was Obed’s mother. Obed was the father of Jesse.
Matthew,1,6,And Jesse was the father of King David. David was the father of Solomon. Solomon’s mother had been Uriah’s wife.
Matthew,1,7,Solomon was the father of Rehoboam. Rehoboam was the father of Abijah. Abijah was the father of Asa.
Matthew,1,8,Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat was the father of Jehoram. Jehoram was the father of Uzziah.
Matthew,1,9,Uzziah was the father of Jotham. Jotham was the father of Ahaz. Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah.
Matthew,1,10,Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh. Manasseh was the father of Amon. Amon was the father of Josiah.
Matthew,1,11,"And Josiah was the father of Jeconiah and his brothers. At that time, the Jewish people were forced to go away to Babylon."
Matthew,1,12,"After this, the family line continued. Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel."
Matthew,1,13,Zerubbabel was the father of Abihud. Abihud was the father of Eliakim. Eliakim was the father of Azor.
Matthew,1,14,Azor was the father of Zadok. Zadok was the father of Akim. Akim was the father of Elihud.
Matthew,1,15,Elihud was the father of Eleazar. Eleazar was the father of Matthan. Matthan was the father of Jacob.
Matthew,1,16,"Jacob was the father of Joseph. Joseph was the husband of Mary. And Mary was the mother of Jesus, who is called the Messiah."
Matthew,1,17,So there were 14 generations from Abraham to David. There were 14 from David until the Jewish people were forced to go away to Babylon. And there were 14 from that time to the Messiah.
Matthew,1,18,"This is how the birth of Jesus the Messiah came about. His mother Mary and Joseph had promised to get married. But before they started to live together, it became clear that she was going to have a baby. She became pregnant by the power of the Holy Spirit."
Matthew,1,19,Her husband Joseph was faithful to the law. But he did not want to put her to shame in public. So he planned to divorce her quietly.
Matthew,1,20,"But as Joseph was thinking about this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream. The angel said, “Joseph, son of David, don’t be afraid to take Mary home as your wife. The baby inside her is from the Holy Spirit."
Matthew,1,21,She is going to have a son. You must give him the name Jesus. That’s because he will save his people from their sins.”
Matthew,1,22,"All this took place to bring about what the Lord had said would happen. He had said through the prophet,"
Matthew,1,23,“The virgin is going to have a baby. She will give birth to a son. And he will be called Immanuel.”( Isaiah 7:14) The name Immanuel means “God with us.”
Matthew,1,24,Joseph woke up. He did what the angel of the Lord commanded him to do. He took Mary home as his wife.
Matthew,1,25,But he did not sleep with her until she gave birth to a son. And Joseph gave him the name Jesus.
Matthew,2,1,"Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea. This happened while Herod was king of Judea. After Jesus’ birth, Wise Men from the east came to Jerusalem."
Matthew,2,2,"They asked, “Where is the child who has been born to be king of the Jews? We saw his star when it rose. Now we have come to worship him.”"
Matthew,2,3,"When King Herod heard about it, he was very upset. Everyone in Jerusalem was troubled too."
Matthew,2,4,So Herod called together all the chief priests of the people. He also called the teachers of the law. He asked them where the Messiah was going to be born.
Matthew,2,5,"“In Bethlehem in Judea,” they replied. “This is what the prophet has written. He said,"
Matthew,2,6,"“ ‘But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are certainly not the least important among the towns of Judah. A ruler will come out of you. He will rule my people Israel like a shepherd.’ ”( Micah 5:2)"
Matthew,2,7,Then Herod secretly called for the Wise Men. He found out from them exactly when the star had appeared.
Matthew,2,8,"He sent them to Bethlehem. He said, “Go and search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, report it to me. Then I can go and worship him too.”"
Matthew,2,9,"After the Wise Men had listened to the king, they went on their way. The star they had seen when it rose went ahead of them. It finally stopped over the place where the child was."
Matthew,2,10,"When they saw the star, they were filled with joy."
Matthew,2,11,"The Wise Men went to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures. They gave him gold, frankincense and myrrh."
Matthew,2,12,But God warned them in a dream not to go back to Herod. So they returned to their country on a different road.
Matthew,2,13,"When the Wise Men had left, Joseph had a dream. In the dream an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph. “Get up!” the angel said. “Take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you to come back. Herod is going to search for the child. He wants to kill him.”"
Matthew,2,14,"So Joseph got up. During the night, he left for Egypt with the child and his mother Mary."
Matthew,2,15,"They stayed there until King Herod died. So the words the Lord had spoken through the prophet came true. He had said, “I brought my son out of Egypt.”( Hosea 11:1)"
Matthew,2,16,Herod realized that the Wise Men had tricked him. So he became very angry. He gave orders about Bethlehem and the area around it. He ordered all the boys two years old and under to be killed. This agreed with the time when the Wise Men had seen the star.
Matthew,2,17,"In this way, the words Jeremiah the prophet spoke came true. He had said,"
Matthew,2,18,"“A voice is heard in Ramah. It’s the sound of crying and deep sadness. Rachel is crying over her children. She refuses to be comforted, because they are gone.”( Jeremiah 31:15)"
Matthew,2,19,"After Herod died, Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt. In the dream an angel of the Lord appeared to him."
Matthew,2,20,"The angel said, “Get up! Take the child and his mother. Go to the land of Israel. The people who were trying to kill the child are dead.”"
Matthew,2,21,So Joseph got up. He took the child and his mother Mary back to the land of Israel.
Matthew,2,22,But then he heard that Archelaus was king of Judea. Archelaus was ruling in place of his father Herod. This made Joseph afraid to go there. Joseph had been warned in a dream. So he went back to the land of Galilee instead.
Matthew,2,23,There he lived in a town called Nazareth. So what the prophets had said about Jesus came true. They had said that he would be called a Nazarene.
Matthew,3,1,In those days John the Baptist came and preached in the Desert of Judea.
Matthew,3,2,"He said, “Turn away from your sins! The kingdom of heaven has come near.”"
Matthew,3,3,"John is the one Isaiah the prophet had spoken about. He had said, “A messenger is calling out in the desert, ‘Prepare the way for the Lord. Make straight paths for him.’ ”( Isaiah 40:3)"
Matthew,3,4,John’s clothes were made out of camel’s hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
Matthew,3,5,People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea. They also came from the whole area around the Jordan River.
Matthew,3,6,"When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan."
Matthew,3,7,"John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing. He said to them, “You are like a nest of poisonous snakes! Who warned you to escape the coming of God’s anger?"
Matthew,3,8,Live in a way that shows you have turned away from your sins.
Matthew,3,9,"Don’t think you can say to yourselves, ‘Abraham is our father.’ I tell you, God can raise up children for Abraham even from these stones."
Matthew,3,10,The ax is ready to cut the roots of the trees. All the trees that don’t produce good fruit will be cut down. They will be thrown into the fire.
Matthew,3,11,"“I baptize you with water, calling you to turn away from your sins. But after me, someone is coming who is more powerful than I am. I’m not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire."
Matthew,3,12,His pitchfork is in his hand to clear the straw from his threshing floor. He will gather his wheat into the storeroom. But he will burn up the husks with fire that can’t be put out.”
Matthew,3,13,Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River. He wanted to be baptized by John.
Matthew,3,14,"But John tried to stop him. So he told Jesus, “I need to be baptized by you. So why do you come to me?”"
Matthew,3,15,"Jesus replied, “Let it be this way for now. It is right for us to do this. It carries out God’s holy plan.” Then John agreed."
Matthew,3,16,"As soon as Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened. Jesus saw the Spirit of God coming down on him like a dove."
Matthew,3,17,"A voice from heaven said, “This is my Son, and I love him. I am very pleased with him.”"
Matthew,4,1,The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the desert. There the devil tempted him.
Matthew,4,2,"After 40 days and 40 nights of going without eating, Jesus was hungry."
Matthew,4,3,"The tempter came to him. He said, “If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.”"
Matthew,4,4,"Jesus answered, “It is written, ‘Man must not live only on bread. He must also live on every word that comes from the mouth of God.’ ”( Deuteronomy 8:3)"
Matthew,4,5,Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city. He had him stand on the highest point of the temple.
Matthew,4,6,"“If you are the Son of God,” he said, “throw yourself down. It is written, “ ‘The Lord will command his angels to take good care of you. They will lift you up in their hands. Then you won’t trip over a stone.’ ”( Psalm 91:11, 12)"
Matthew,4,7,"Jesus answered him, “It is also written, ‘Do not test the Lord your God.’ ”( Deuteronomy 6:16)"
Matthew,4,8,"Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain. He showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory."
Matthew,4,9,"“If you bow down and worship me,” he said, “I will give you all this.”"
Matthew,4,10,"Jesus said to him, “Get away from me, Satan! It is written, ‘Worship the Lord your God. He is the only one you should serve.’ ”( Deuteronomy 6:13)"
Matthew,4,11,Then the devil left Jesus. Angels came and took care of him.
Matthew,4,12,"John had been put in prison. When Jesus heard about this, he returned to Galilee."
Matthew,4,13,Jesus left Nazareth and went to live in the city of Capernaum. It was by the lake in the area of Zebulun and Naphtali.
Matthew,4,14,"In that way, what the prophet Isaiah had said came true. He had said,"
Matthew,4,15,"“Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Galilee, where Gentiles live! Land along the Mediterranean Sea! Territory east of the Jordan River!"
Matthew,4,16,"The people who are now living in darkness have seen a great light. They are now living in a very dark land. But a light has shined on them.”( Isaiah 9:1, 2)"
Matthew,4,17,From that time on Jesus began to preach. “Turn away from your sins!” he said. “The kingdom of heaven has come near.”
Matthew,4,18,"One day Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee. There he saw two brothers, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were throwing a net into the lake, because they were fishermen."
Matthew,4,19,"“Come and follow me,” Jesus said. “I will send you out to fish for people.”"
Matthew,4,20,At once they left their nets and followed him.
Matthew,4,21,"Going on from there, he saw two other brothers. They were James, son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee. As they were preparing their nets, Jesus called out to them."
Matthew,4,22,Right away they left the boat and their father and followed Jesus.
Matthew,4,23,Jesus went all over Galilee. There he taught in the synagogues. He preached the good news of God’s kingdom. He healed every illness and sickness the people had.
Matthew,4,24,News about him spread all over Syria. People brought to him all who were ill with different kinds of sicknesses. Some were suffering great pain. Others were controlled by demons. Some were shaking wildly. Others couldn’t move at all. And Jesus healed all of them.
Matthew,4,25,"Large crowds followed him. People came from Galilee, from the area known as the Ten Cities, and from Jerusalem and Judea. Others came from the area across the Jordan River."
Matthew,5,1,Jesus saw the crowds. So he went up on a mountainside and sat down. His disciples came to him.
Matthew,5,2,"Then he began to teach them. He said,"
Matthew,5,3,“Blessed are those who are spiritually needy. The kingdom of heaven belongs to them.
Matthew,5,4,Blessed are those who are sad. They will be comforted.
Matthew,5,5,Blessed are those who are humble. They will be given the earth.
Matthew,5,6,Blessed are those who are hungry and thirsty for what is right. They will be filled.
Matthew,5,7,Blessed are those who show mercy. They will be shown mercy.
Matthew,5,8,Blessed are those whose hearts are pure. They will see God.
Matthew,5,9,Blessed are those who make peace. They will be called children of God.
Matthew,5,10,Blessed are those who suffer for doing what is right. The kingdom of heaven belongs to them.
Matthew,5,11,“Blessed are you when people make fun of you and hurt you because of me. You are also blessed when they tell all kinds of evil lies about you because of me.
Matthew,5,12,"Be joyful and glad. Your reward in heaven is great. In the same way, people hurt the prophets who lived long ago."
Matthew,5,13,“You are the salt of the earth. But suppose the salt loses its saltiness. How can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything. It will be thrown out. People will walk all over it.
Matthew,5,14,“You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill can’t be hidden.
Matthew,5,15,"Also, people do not light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead, they put it on its stand. Then it gives light to everyone in the house."
Matthew,5,16,"In the same way, let your light shine so others can see it. Then they will see the good things you do. And they will bring glory to your Father who is in heaven."
Matthew,5,17,"“Do not think I have come to get rid of what is written in the Law or in the Prophets. I have not come to do this. Instead, I have come to fulfill what is written."
Matthew,5,18,What I’m about to tell you is true. Heaven and earth will disappear before the smallest letter disappears from the Law. Not even the smallest mark of a pen will disappear from the Law until everything is completed.
Matthew,5,19,"Do not ignore even one of the least important commands. And do not teach others to ignore them. If you do, you will be called the least important person in the kingdom of heaven. Instead, practice and teach these commands. Then you will be called important in the kingdom of heaven."
Matthew,5,20,"Here is what I tell you. You must be more godly than the Pharisees and the teachers of the law. If you are not, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven."
Matthew,5,21,"“You have heard what was said to people who lived long ago. They were told, ‘Do not commit murder.( Exodus 20:13) Anyone who murders will be judged for it.’"
Matthew,5,22,"But here is what I tell you. Do not be angry with a brother or sister. Anyone who is angry with them will be judged. Again, anyone who says to a brother or sister, ‘Raca,’ must stand trial in court. And anyone who says, ‘You fool!’ will be in danger of the fire in hell."
Matthew,5,23,“Suppose you are offering your gift at the altar. And you remember that your brother or sister has something against you.
Matthew,5,24,Leave your gift in front of the altar. First go and make peace with them. Then come back and offer your gift.
Matthew,5,25,"“Suppose someone has a claim against you and is taking you to court. Settle the matter quickly. Do this while you are still together on the way. If you don’t, you may be handed over to the judge. The judge may hand you over to the officer to be thrown into prison."
Matthew,5,26,What I’m about to tell you is true. You will not get out until you have paid the very last penny!
Matthew,5,27,"“You have heard that it was said, ‘Do not commit adultery.’( Exodus 20:14)"
Matthew,5,28,But here is what I tell you. Do not even look at a woman in the wrong way. Anyone who does has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
Matthew,5,29,"If your right eye causes you to sin, poke it out and throw it away. Your eye is only one part of your body. It is better to lose an eye than for your whole body to be thrown into hell."
Matthew,5,30,"If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. Your hand is only one part of your body. It is better to lose a hand than for your whole body to go into hell."
Matthew,5,31,"“It has been said, ‘Suppose a man divorces his wife. If he does, he must give her a letter of divorce.’( Deuteronomy 24:1)"
Matthew,5,32,But here is what I tell you. Anyone who divorces his wife makes her a victim of adultery. And anyone who gets married to the divorced woman commits adultery. A man may divorce his wife only if she has not been faithful to him.
Matthew,5,33,"“Again, you have heard what was said to your people long ago. They were told, ‘Do not break the promises you make to the Lord. Keep your promises to the Lord that you have made.’"
Matthew,5,34,But here is what I tell you. Do not make any promises like that at all. Do not make them in the name of heaven. That is God’s throne.
Matthew,5,35,Do not make them in the name of the earth. That is the stool for God’s feet. Do not make them in the name of Jerusalem. That is the city of the Great King.
Matthew,5,36,And do not make a promise in your own name. You can’t make even one hair of your head white or black.
Matthew,5,37,All you need to say is simply ‘Yes’ or ‘No.’ Anything more than this comes from the evil one.
Matthew,5,38,"“You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye must be put out for an eye. A tooth must be knocked out for a tooth.’( Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)"
Matthew,5,39,But here is what I tell you. Do not fight against an evil person. Suppose someone slaps you on your right cheek. Turn your other cheek to them also.
Matthew,5,40,Suppose someone takes you to court to get your shirt. Let them have your coat also.
Matthew,5,41,Suppose someone forces you to go one mile. Go two miles with them.
Matthew,5,42,Give to the one who asks you for something. Don’t turn away from the one who wants to borrow something from you.
Matthew,5,43,"“You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor.( Leviticus 19:18) Hate your enemy.’"
Matthew,5,44,But here is what I tell you. Love your enemies. Pray for those who hurt you.
Matthew,5,45,Then you will be children of your Father who is in heaven. He causes his sun to shine on evil people and good people. He sends rain on those who do right and those who don’t.
Matthew,5,46,"If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Even the tax collectors do that."
Matthew,5,47,"If you greet only your own people, what more are you doing than others? Even people who are ungodly do that."
Matthew,5,48,"So be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect."
Matthew,6,1,"“Be careful not to do good deeds in front of other people. Don’t do those deeds to be seen by others. If you do, your Father in heaven will not reward you."
Matthew,6,2,"“When you give to needy people, do not announce it by having trumpets blown. Do not be like those who only pretend to be holy. They announce what they do in the synagogues and on the streets. They want to be honored by other people. What I’m about to tell you is true. They have received their complete reward."
Matthew,6,3,"When you give to needy people, don’t let your left hand know what your right hand is doing."
Matthew,6,4,"Then your giving will be done secretly. Your Father will reward you, because he sees what you do secretly."
Matthew,6,5,"“When you pray, do not be like those who only pretend to be holy. They love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the street corners. They want to be seen by other people. What I’m about to tell you is true. They have received their complete reward."
Matthew,6,6,"When you pray, go into your room. Close the door and pray to your Father, who can’t be seen. Your Father will reward you, because he sees what you do secretly."
Matthew,6,7,"When you pray, do not keep talking on and on. That is what ungodly people do. They think they will be heard because they talk a lot."
Matthew,6,8,Do not be like them. Your Father knows what you need even before you ask him.
Matthew,6,9,"“This is how you should pray. “ ‘Our Father in heaven, may your name be honored."
Matthew,6,10,May your kingdom come. May what you want to happen be done on earth as it is done in heaven.
Matthew,6,11,Give us today our daily bread.
Matthew,6,12,"And forgive us our sins, just as we also have forgiven those who sin against us."
Matthew,6,13,Keep us from sinning when we are tempted. Save us from the evil one.’
Matthew,6,14,"Forgive other people when they sin against you. If you do, your Father who is in heaven will also forgive you."
Matthew,6,15,"But if you do not forgive the sins of other people, your Father will not forgive your sins."
Matthew,6,16,"“When you go without eating, do not look gloomy like those who only pretend to be holy. They make their faces look very sad. They want to show people they are fasting. What I’m about to tell you is true. They have received their complete reward."
Matthew,6,17,"But when you go without eating, put olive oil on your head. Wash your face."
Matthew,6,18,"Then others will not know that you are fasting. Only your Father, who can’t be seen, will know it. Your Father will reward you, because he sees what you do secretly."
Matthew,6,19,“Do not gather for yourselves riches on earth. Moths and rats can destroy them. Thieves can break in and steal them.
Matthew,6,20,"Instead, gather for yourselves riches in heaven. There, moths and rats do not destroy them. There, thieves do not break in and steal them."
Matthew,6,21,Your heart will be where your riches are.
Matthew,6,22,“The eye is like a lamp for the body. Suppose your eyes are healthy. Then your whole body will be full of light.
Matthew,6,23,"But suppose your eyes can’t see well. Then your whole body will be full of darkness. If the light inside you is darkness, then it is very dark!"
Matthew,6,24,“No one can serve two masters at the same time. You will hate one of them and love the other. Or you will be faithful to one and dislike the other. You can’t serve God and money at the same time.
Matthew,6,25,"“I tell you, do not worry. Don’t worry about your life and what you will eat or drink. And don’t worry about your body and what you will wear. Isn’t there more to life than eating? Aren’t there more important things for the body than clothes?"
Matthew,6,26,Look at the birds of the air. They don’t plant or gather crops. They don’t put away crops in storerooms. But your Father who is in heaven feeds them. Aren’t you worth much more than they are?
Matthew,6,27,Can you add even one hour to your life by worrying?
Matthew,6,28,“And why do you worry about clothes? See how the wild flowers grow. They don’t work or make clothing.
Matthew,6,29,But here is what I tell you. Not even Solomon in all his royal robes was dressed like one of these flowers.
Matthew,6,30,"If that is how God dresses the wild grass, won’t he dress you even better? Your faith is so small! After all, the grass is here only today. Tomorrow it is thrown into the fire."
Matthew,6,31,"So don’t worry. Don’t say, ‘What will we eat?’ Or, ‘What will we drink?’ Or, ‘What will we wear?’"
Matthew,6,32,People who are ungodly run after all those things. Your Father who is in heaven knows that you need them.
Matthew,6,33,But put God’s kingdom first. Do what he wants you to do. Then all those things will also be given to you.
Matthew,6,34,So don’t worry about tomorrow. Tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
Matthew,7,1,“Do not judge other people. Then you will not be judged.
Matthew,7,2,You will be judged in the same way you judge others. You will be measured in the same way you measure others.
Matthew,7,3,“You look at the bit of sawdust in your friend’s eye. But you pay no attention to the piece of wood in your own eye.
Matthew,7,4,"How can you say to your friend, ‘Let me take the bit of sawdust out of your eye’? How can you say this while there is a piece of wood in your own eye?"
Matthew,7,5,You pretender! First take the piece of wood out of your own eye. Then you will be able to see clearly to take the bit of sawdust out of your friend’s eye.
Matthew,7,6,"“Do not give holy things to dogs. Do not throw your pearls to pigs. If you do, they might walk all over them. They might turn around and tear you to pieces."
Matthew,7,7,"“Ask, and it will be given to you. Search, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you."
Matthew,7,8,Everyone who asks will receive. The one who searches will find. The door will be opened to the one who knocks.
Matthew,7,9,“Suppose your son asks for bread. Which of you will give him a stone?
Matthew,7,10,Or suppose he asks for a fish. Which of you will give him a snake?
Matthew,7,11,"Even though you are evil, you know how to give good gifts to your children. How much more will your Father who is in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!"
Matthew,7,12,"In everything, do to others what you would want them to do to you. This is what is written in the Law and in the Prophets."
Matthew,7,13,“Enter God’s kingdom through the narrow gate. The gate is large and the road is wide that leads to ruin. Many people go that way.
Matthew,7,14,But the gate is small and the road is narrow that leads to life. Only a few people find it.
Matthew,7,15,“Watch out for false prophets. They come to you pretending to be sheep. But on the inside they are hungry wolves.
Matthew,7,16,You can tell each tree by its fruit. Do people pick grapes from bushes? Do they pick figs from thorns?
Matthew,7,17,"In the same way, every good tree bears good fruit. But a bad tree bears bad fruit."
Matthew,7,18,A good tree can’t bear bad fruit. And a bad tree can’t bear good fruit.
Matthew,7,19,Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down. It is thrown into the fire.
Matthew,7,20,You can tell each tree by its fruit.
Matthew,7,21,"“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven. Only those who do what my Father in heaven wants will enter."
Matthew,7,22,"Many will say to me on that day, ‘Lord! Lord! Didn’t we prophesy in your name? Didn’t we drive out demons in your name? Didn’t we do many miracles in your name?’"
Matthew,7,23,"Then I will tell them clearly, ‘I never knew you. Get away from me, you who do evil!’"
Matthew,7,24,"“So then, everyone who hears my words and puts them into practice is like a wise man. He builds his house on the rock."
Matthew,7,25,The rain comes down. The water rises. The winds blow and beat against that house. But it does not fall. It is built on the rock.
Matthew,7,26,But everyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man. He builds his house on sand.
Matthew,7,27,The rain comes down. The water rises. The winds blow and beat against that house. And it falls with a loud crash.”
Matthew,7,28,Jesus finished saying all these things. The crowds were amazed at his teaching.
Matthew,7,29,That’s because he taught like one who had authority. He did not speak like their teachers of the law.
Matthew,8,1,Jesus came down from the mountainside. Large crowds followed him.
Matthew,8,2,"A man who had a skin disease came and got down on his knees in front of Jesus. He said, “Lord, if you are willing to make me ‘clean,’ you can do it.”"
Matthew,8,3,"Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. “I am willing to do it,” he said. “Be ‘clean’!” Right away the man was healed of his skin disease."
Matthew,8,4,"Then Jesus said to him, “Don’t tell anyone. Go and show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift Moses commanded. It will be a witness to everyone.”"
Matthew,8,5,"When Jesus entered Capernaum, a Roman commander came to him. He asked Jesus for help."
Matthew,8,6,"“Lord,” he said, “my servant lies at home and can’t move. He is suffering terribly.”"
Matthew,8,7,"Jesus said, “Shall I come and heal him?”"
Matthew,8,8,"The commander replied, “Lord, I am not good enough to have you come into my house. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed."
Matthew,8,9,"I myself am a man under authority. And I have soldiers who obey my orders. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes. I tell that one, ‘Come,’ and he comes. I say to my slave, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”"
Matthew,8,10,"When Jesus heard this, he was amazed. He said to those following him, “What I’m about to tell you is true. In Israel I have not found anyone whose faith is so strong."
Matthew,8,11,"I say to you that many will come from the east and the west. They will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of heaven. They will sit with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob."
Matthew,8,12,"But those who think they belong in the kingdom will be thrown outside, into the darkness. There they will weep and grind their teeth.”"
Matthew,8,13,"Then Jesus said to the Roman commander, “Go! It will be done just as you believed it would.” And his servant was healed at that moment."
Matthew,8,14,"When Jesus came into Peter’s house, he saw Peter’s mother-in-law. She was lying in bed. She had a fever."
Matthew,8,15,"Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and began to serve him."
Matthew,8,16,"When evening came, many people controlled by demons were brought to Jesus. He drove out the spirits with a word. He healed all who were sick."
Matthew,8,17,"This happened so that what Isaiah the prophet had said would come true. He had said, “He suffered the things we should have suffered. He took on himself the sicknesses that should have been ours.”( Isaiah 53:4)"
Matthew,8,18,Jesus saw the crowd around him. So he gave his disciples orders to go to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
Matthew,8,19,"Then a teacher of the law came to him. He said, “Teacher, I will follow you no matter where you go.”"
Matthew,8,20,"Jesus replied, “Foxes have dens. Birds have nests. But the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.”"
Matthew,8,21,"Another follower said to him, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.”"
Matthew,8,22,"But Jesus told him, “Follow me. Let the dead bury their own dead.”"
Matthew,8,23,Jesus got into a boat. His disciples followed him.
Matthew,8,24,Suddenly a terrible storm came up on the lake. The waves crashed over the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
Matthew,8,25,"The disciples went and woke him up. They said, “Lord! Save us! We’re going to drown!”"
Matthew,8,26,"He replied, “Your faith is so small! Why are you so afraid?” Then Jesus got up and ordered the winds and the waves to stop. It became completely calm."
Matthew,8,27,"The disciples were amazed. They asked, “What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the waves obey him!”"
Matthew,8,28,Jesus arrived at the other side of the lake in the area of the Gadarenes. Two men controlled by demons met him. They came from the tombs. The men were so wild that no one could pass that way.
Matthew,8,29,"“Son of God, what do you want with us?” they shouted. “Have you come here to punish us before the time for us to be judged?”"
Matthew,8,30,"Not very far away, a large herd of pigs was feeding."
Matthew,8,31,"The demons begged Jesus, “If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs.”"
Matthew,8,32,"Jesus said to them, “Go!” So the demons came out of the men and went into the pigs. The whole herd rushed down the steep bank. They ran into the lake and drowned in the water."
Matthew,8,33,Those who were tending the pigs ran off. They went into the town and reported all this. They told the people what had happened to the men who had been controlled by demons.
Matthew,8,34,"Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged him to leave their area."
Matthew,9,1,Jesus stepped into a boat. He went over to the other side of the lake and came to his own town.
Matthew,9,2,"Some men brought to him a man who could not walk. He was lying on a mat. Jesus saw that they had faith. So he said to the man, “Don’t lose hope, son. Your sins are forgiven.”"
Matthew,9,3,"Then some teachers of the law said to themselves, “This fellow is saying a very evil thing!”"
Matthew,9,4,"Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said, “Why do you have evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Matthew,9,5,"Is it easier to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven’? Or to say, ‘Get up and walk’?"
Matthew,9,6,"But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.” So he spoke to the man who could not walk. “Get up,” he said. “Take your mat and go home.”"
Matthew,9,7,The man got up and went home.
Matthew,9,8,"When the crowd saw this, they were filled with wonder. They praised God for giving that kind of authority to a human being."
Matthew,9,9,"As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew. He was sitting at the tax collector’s booth. “Follow me,” Jesus told him. Matthew got up and followed him."
Matthew,9,10,Later Jesus was having dinner at Matthew’s house. Many tax collectors and sinners came. They ate with Jesus and his disciples.
Matthew,9,11,"The Pharisees saw this. So they asked the disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”"
Matthew,9,12,"Jesus heard this. So he said, “Those who are healthy don’t need a doctor. Sick people do."
Matthew,9,13,"Go and learn what this means, ‘I want mercy and not sacrifice.’( Hosea 6:6) I have not come to get those who think they are right with God to follow me. I have come to get sinners to follow me.”"
Matthew,9,14,"One day John’s disciples came. They said to Jesus, “We and the Pharisees often go without eating. Why don’t your disciples go without eating?”"
Matthew,9,15,"Jesus answered, “How can the guests of the groom be sad while he is with them? The time will come when the groom will be taken away from them. Then they will fast."
Matthew,9,16,“People don’t sew a patch of new cloth on old clothes. The new piece will pull away from the old. That will make the tear worse.
Matthew,9,17,"People don’t pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst. The wine will run out, and the wineskins will be destroyed. No, people pour new wine into new wineskins. Then both are saved.”"
Matthew,9,18,"While Jesus was saying this, a synagogue leader came. He got down on his knees in front of Jesus. He said, “My daughter has just died. But come and place your hand on her. Then she will live again.”"
Matthew,9,19,Jesus got up and went with him. So did his disciples.
Matthew,9,20,Just then a woman came up behind Jesus. She had a sickness that made her bleed. It had lasted for 12 years. She touched the edge of his clothes.
Matthew,9,21,"She thought, “I only need to touch his clothes. Then I will be healed.”"
Matthew,9,22,"Jesus turned and saw her. “Dear woman, don’t give up hope,” he said. “Your faith has healed you.” The woman was healed at that moment."
Matthew,9,23,"When Jesus entered the synagogue leader’s house, he saw the noisy crowd and people playing flutes."
Matthew,9,24,"He said, “Go away. The girl is not dead. She is sleeping.” But they laughed at him."
Matthew,9,25,"After the crowd had been sent outside, Jesus went in. He took the girl by the hand, and she got up."
Matthew,9,26,News about what Jesus had done spread all over that area.
Matthew,9,27,"As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him. They called out, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!”"
Matthew,9,28,"When Jesus went indoors, the blind men came to him. He asked them, “Do you believe that I can do this?” “Yes, Lord,” they replied."
Matthew,9,29,"Then he touched their eyes. He said, “It will happen to you just as you believed.”"
Matthew,9,30,"They could now see again. Jesus strongly warned them, “Be sure that no one knows about this.”"
Matthew,9,31,But they went out and spread the news. They talked about him all over that area.
Matthew,9,32,"While they were going out, another man was brought to Jesus. A demon controlled him, and he could not speak."
Matthew,9,33,"When the demon was driven out, the man spoke. The crowd was amazed. They said, “Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel.”"
Matthew,9,34,"But the Pharisees said, “He drives out demons by the power of the prince of demons.”"
Matthew,9,35,Jesus went through all the towns and villages. He taught in their synagogues. He preached the good news of the kingdom. And he healed every illness and sickness.
Matthew,9,36,"When he saw the crowds, he felt deep concern for them. They were treated badly and were helpless, like sheep without a shepherd."
Matthew,9,37,"Then Jesus said to his disciples, “The harvest is huge. But there are only a few workers."
Matthew,9,38,So ask the Lord of the harvest to send workers out into his harvest field.”
Matthew,10,1,Jesus called for his 12 disciples to come to him. He gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every illness and sickness.
Matthew,10,2,"Here are the names of the 12 apostles. First there were Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. Then came James, son of Zebedee, and his brother John."
Matthew,10,3,"Next were Philip and Bartholomew, and also Thomas and Matthew the tax collector. Two more were James, son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus."
Matthew,10,4,The last were Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot. Judas was the one who was later going to hand Jesus over to his enemies.
Matthew,10,5,"Jesus sent these 12 out with the following orders. “Do not go among the Gentiles,” he said. “Do not enter any town of the Samaritans."
Matthew,10,6,"Instead, go to the people of Israel. They are like sheep that have become lost."
Matthew,10,7,"As you go, preach this message, ‘The kingdom of heaven has come near.’"
Matthew,10,8,"Heal those who are sick. Bring those who are dead back to life. Make those who have skin diseases ‘clean’ again. Drive out demons. You have received freely, so give freely."
Matthew,10,9,"“Do not get any gold, silver or copper to take with you in your belts."
Matthew,10,10,Do not take a bag for the journey. Do not take extra clothes or sandals or walking sticks. A worker should be given what he needs.
Matthew,10,11,"When you enter a town or village, look for someone who is willing to welcome you. Stay at their house until you leave."
Matthew,10,12,"As you enter the home, greet those who live there."
Matthew,10,13,"If that home welcomes you, give it your blessing of peace. If it does not, don’t bless it."
Matthew,10,14,"Some people may not welcome you or listen to your words. If they don’t, leave that home or town, and shake the dust off your feet."
Matthew,10,15,What I’m about to tell you is true. On judgment day it will be easier for Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town.
Matthew,10,16,“I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. So be as wise as snakes and as harmless as doves.
Matthew,10,17,Watch out! You will be handed over to the local courts. You will be whipped in the synagogues.
Matthew,10,18,You will be brought to governors and kings because of me. You will be witnesses to them and to the Gentiles.
Matthew,10,19,"But when they arrest you, don’t worry about what you will say or how you will say it. At that time you will be given the right words to say."
Matthew,10,20,It will not be you speaking. The Spirit of your Father will be speaking through you.
Matthew,10,21,“Brothers will hand over brothers to be killed. Fathers will hand over their children. Children will rise up against their parents and have them put to death.
Matthew,10,22,You will be hated by everyone because of me. But anyone who remains strong in the faith will be saved.
Matthew,10,23,"When people attack you in one place, escape to another. What I’m about to tell you is true. You will not finish going through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes."
Matthew,10,24,“The student is not better than the teacher. A slave is not better than his master.
Matthew,10,25,"It is enough for students to be like their teachers. And it is enough for slaves to be like their masters. If the head of the house has been called Beelzebul, what can the others who live there expect?"
Matthew,10,26,“So don’t be afraid of your enemies. Everything that is secret will be brought out into the open. Everything that is hidden will be uncovered.
Matthew,10,27,"What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight. What is whispered in your ear, shout from the rooftops."
Matthew,10,28,"Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but can’t kill the soul. Instead, be afraid of the one who can destroy both soul and body in hell."
Matthew,10,29,Aren’t two sparrows sold for only a penny? But not one of them falls to the ground outside your Father’s care.
Matthew,10,30,He even counts every hair on your head!
Matthew,10,31,So don’t be afraid. You are worth more than many sparrows.
Matthew,10,32,“What if someone says in front of others that they know me? I will also say in front of my Father who is in heaven that I know them.
Matthew,10,33,But what if someone says in front of others that they don’t know me? I will say in front of my Father who is in heaven that I don’t know them.
Matthew,10,34,“Do not think that I came to bring peace to the earth. I didn’t come to bring peace. I came to bring a sword.
Matthew,10,35,I have come to turn “ ‘sons against their fathers. Daughters will refuse to obey their mothers. Daughters-in-law will be against their mothers-in-law.
Matthew,10,36,A man’s enemies will be the members of his own family.’( Micah 7:6)
Matthew,10,37,“Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. Anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
Matthew,10,38,Whoever does not pick up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
Matthew,10,39,Whoever finds their life will lose it. Whoever loses their life because of me will find it.
Matthew,10,40,“Anyone who welcomes you welcomes me. And anyone who welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.
Matthew,10,41,Suppose someone welcomes a prophet as a prophet. They will receive a prophet’s reward. And suppose someone welcomes a godly person as a godly person. They will receive a godly person’s reward.
Matthew,10,42,Suppose someone gives even a cup of cold water to a little one who follows me. What I’m about to tell you is true. That person will certainly be rewarded.”
Matthew,11,1,Jesus finished teaching his 12 disciples. Then he went on to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee.
Matthew,11,2,"John the Baptist was in prison. When he heard about the actions of the Messiah, he sent his disciples to him."
Matthew,11,3,"They asked Jesus, “Are you the one who is supposed to come? Or should we look for someone else?”"
Matthew,11,4,"Jesus replied, “Go back to John. Report to him what you hear and see."
Matthew,11,5,Blind people receive sight. Disabled people walk. Those who have skin diseases are made ‘clean.’ Deaf people hear. Those who are dead are raised to life. And the good news is preached to those who are poor.
Matthew,11,6,Blessed is anyone who does not give up their faith because of me.”
Matthew,11,7,"As John’s disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John. He said, “What did you go out into the desert to see? Tall grass waving in the wind?"
Matthew,11,8,"If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No. People who wear fine clothes are in kings’ palaces."
Matthew,11,9,"Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet."
Matthew,11,10,"He is the one written about in Scripture. It says, “ ‘I will send my messenger ahead of you. He will prepare your way for you.’( Malachi 3:1)"
Matthew,11,11,What I’m about to tell you is true. No one more important than John the Baptist has ever been born. But the least important person in the kingdom of heaven is more important than he is.
Matthew,11,12,"Since the days of John the Baptist, the kingdom of heaven has been under attack. And violent people are taking hold of it."
Matthew,11,13,All the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John came.
Matthew,11,14,"If you are willing to accept it, John is the Elijah who was supposed to come."
Matthew,11,15,Whoever has ears should listen.
Matthew,11,16,"“What can I compare today’s people to? They are like children sitting in the markets and calling out to others. They say,"
Matthew,11,17,“ ‘We played the flute for you. But you didn’t dance. We sang a funeral song. But you didn’t become sad.’
Matthew,11,18,"When John came, he didn’t eat or drink as you do. And people say, ‘He has a demon.’"
Matthew,11,19,"But when the Son of Man came, he ate and drank as you do. And people say, ‘This fellow is always eating and drinking far too much. He’s a friend of tax collectors and “sinners.” ’ By wise actions wisdom is shown to be right.”"
Matthew,11,20,"Jesus began to speak against the towns where he had done most of his miracles. The people there had not turned away from their sins. So he said,"
Matthew,11,21,"“How terrible it will be for you, Chorazin! How terrible for you, Bethsaida! Suppose the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon. They would have turned away from their sins long ago. They would have put on clothes for mourning. They would have sat down in ashes."
Matthew,11,22,But I tell you this. On judgment day it will be easier for Tyre and Sidon than for you.
Matthew,11,23,"And what about you, Capernaum? Will you be lifted to the heavens? No! You will go down to the place of the dead. Suppose the miracles done in you had been done in Sodom. It would still be here today."
Matthew,11,24,But I tell you this. On judgment day it will be easier for Sodom than for you.”
Matthew,11,25,"At that time Jesus said, “I praise you, Father. You are Lord of heaven and earth. You have hidden these things from wise and educated people. But you have shown them to little children."
Matthew,11,26,"Yes, Father. This is what you wanted to do."
Matthew,11,27,“My Father has given all things to me. The Father is the only one who knows the Son. And the only ones who know the Father are the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to make him known.
Matthew,11,28,"“Come to me, all you who are tired and are carrying heavy loads. I will give you rest."
Matthew,11,29,Become my servants and learn from me. I am gentle and free of pride. You will find rest for your souls.
Matthew,11,30,"Serving me is easy, and my load is light.”"
Matthew,12,1,One Sabbath day Jesus walked through the grainfields. His disciples were hungry. So they began to break off some heads of grain and eat them.
Matthew,12,2,"The Pharisees saw this. They said to Jesus, “Look! It is against the Law to do this on the Sabbath day. But your disciples are doing it anyway!”"
Matthew,12,3,"Jesus answered, “Haven’t you read about what David did? He and his men were hungry."
Matthew,12,4,So he entered the house of God. He and his men ate the holy bread. Only priests were allowed to eat it.
Matthew,12,5,Haven’t you read the Law? It tells how every Sabbath day the priests in the temple have to do their work on that day. But they are not considered guilty.
Matthew,12,6,I tell you that something more important than the temple is here.
Matthew,12,7,"Scripture says, ‘I want mercy and not sacrifice.’( Hosea 6:6) You don’t know what those words mean. If you did, you would not bring charges against those who are not guilty."
Matthew,12,8,The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath day.”
Matthew,12,9,"Going on from that place, Jesus went into their synagogue."
Matthew,12,10,"A man with a weak and twisted hand was there. The Pharisees were trying to accuse Jesus of a crime. So they asked him, “Does the Law allow us to heal on the Sabbath day?”"
Matthew,12,11,"He said to them, “What if one of your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath day? Won’t you take hold of it and lift it out?"
Matthew,12,12,A person is worth more than sheep! So the Law allows us to do good on the Sabbath day.”
Matthew,12,13,"Then Jesus said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” So he stretched it out. It had been made as good as new. It was just as good as the other hand."
Matthew,12,14,But the Pharisees went out and planned how to kill Jesus.
Matthew,12,15,"Jesus knew all about the Pharisees’ plans. So he left that place. A large crowd followed him, and he healed all who were sick."
Matthew,12,16,But he warned them not to tell other people about him.
Matthew,12,17,"This was to make what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah come true. It says,"
Matthew,12,18,“Here is my servant. I have chosen him. He is the one I love. I am very pleased with him. I will put my Spirit on him. He will announce to the nations that everything will be made right.
Matthew,12,19,He will not argue or cry out. No one will hear his voice in the streets.
Matthew,12,20,He will not break a bent twig. He will not put out a dimly burning flame. He will make right win over wrong.
Matthew,12,21,The nations will put their hope in him.”( Isaiah 42:1–4)
Matthew,12,22,A man controlled by demons was brought to Jesus. The man was blind and could not speak. Jesus healed him. Then the man could speak and see.
Matthew,12,23,"All the people were amazed. They said, “Could this be the Son of David?”"
Matthew,12,24,"The Pharisees heard this. So they said, “This fellow drives out demons by the power of Beelzebul, the prince of demons.”"
Matthew,12,25,"Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said to them, “Every kingdom that fights against itself will be destroyed. Every city or family that is divided against itself will not stand."
Matthew,12,26,"If Satan drives out Satan, he fights against himself. Then how can his kingdom stand?"
Matthew,12,27,"You say I drive out demons by the power of Beelzebul. Then by whose power do your people drive them out? So then, they will be your judges."
Matthew,12,28,But suppose I drive out demons by the Spirit of God. Then the kingdom of God has come to you.
Matthew,12,29,“Or think about this. How can you enter a strong man’s house and just take what the man owns? You must first tie him up. Then you can rob his house.
Matthew,12,30,“Anyone who is not with me is against me. Anyone who does not gather sheep with me scatters them.
Matthew,12,31,So here is what I tell you. Every kind of sin and every evil word spoken against God will be forgiven. But speaking evil things against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
Matthew,12,32,Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven. But anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. A person like that won’t be forgiven either now or in days to come.
Matthew,12,33,"“If you make a tree good, its fruit will be good. If you make a tree bad, its fruit will be bad. You can tell a tree by its fruit."
Matthew,12,34,You nest of poisonous snakes! How can you who are evil say anything good? Your mouths say everything that is in your hearts.
Matthew,12,35,A good man says good things. These come from the good that is stored up inside him. An evil man says evil things. These come from the evil that is stored up inside him.
Matthew,12,36,"But here is what I tell you. On judgment day, everyone will have to account for every empty word they have spoken."
Matthew,12,37,By your words you will be found guilty or not guilty.”
Matthew,12,38,"Some of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law came to Jesus. They said, “Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.”"
Matthew,12,39,"He answered, “Evil and unfaithful people ask for a sign! But none will be given except the sign of the prophet Jonah."
Matthew,12,40,Jonah was in the belly of a huge fish for three days and three nights. Something like that will happen to the Son of Man. He will spend three days and three nights in the grave.
Matthew,12,41,The men of Nineveh will stand up on judgment day with the people now living. And the Ninevites will prove that these people are guilty. The men of Nineveh turned away from their sins when Jonah preached to them. And now something more important than Jonah is here.
Matthew,12,42,The Queen of the South will stand up on judgment day with the people now living. And she will prove that they are guilty. She came from very far away to listen to Solomon’s wisdom. And now something more important than Solomon is here.
Matthew,12,43,“What happens when an evil spirit comes out of a person? It goes through dry areas looking for a place to rest. But it doesn’t find it.
Matthew,12,44,"Then it says, ‘I will return to the house I left.’ When it arrives there, it finds the house empty. The house has been swept clean and put in order."
Matthew,12,45,Then the evil spirit goes and takes with it seven other spirits more evil than itself. They go in and live there. That person is worse off than before. That is how it will be with the evil people of today.”
Matthew,12,46,"While Jesus was still talking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside. They wanted to speak to him."
Matthew,12,47,"Someone told him, “Your mother and brothers are standing outside. They want to speak to you.”"
Matthew,12,48,"Jesus replied to him, “Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?”"
Matthew,12,49,"Jesus pointed to his disciples. He said, “Here is my mother! Here are my brothers!"
Matthew,12,50,Anyone who does what my Father in heaven wants is my brother or sister or mother.”
Matthew,13,1,That same day Jesus left the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.
Matthew,13,2,Large crowds gathered around him. So he got into a boat and sat down. All the people stood on the shore.
Matthew,13,3,"Then he told them many things using stories. He said, “A farmer went out to plant his seed."
Matthew,13,4,He scattered the seed on the ground. Some fell on a path. Birds came and ate it up.
Matthew,13,5,"Some seed fell on rocky places, where there wasn’t much soil. The plants came up quickly, because the soil wasn’t deep."
Matthew,13,6,"When the sun came up, it burned the plants. They dried up because they had no roots."
Matthew,13,7,Other seed fell among thorns. The thorns grew up and crowded out the plants.
Matthew,13,8,"Still other seed fell on good soil. It produced a crop 100, 60 or 30 times more than what was planted."
Matthew,13,9,Whoever has ears should listen.”
Matthew,13,10,"The disciples came to him. They asked, “Why do you use stories when you speak to the people?”"
Matthew,13,11,"He replied, “Because you have been given the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven. It has not been given to outsiders."
Matthew,13,12,"Everyone who has this kind of knowledge will be given more knowledge. In fact, they will have very much. If anyone doesn’t have this kind of knowledge, even what little they have will be taken away from them."
Matthew,13,13,"Here is why I use stories when I speak to the people. I say, “They look, but they don’t really see. They listen, but they don’t really hear or understand."
Matthew,13,14,"In them the words of the prophet Isaiah come true. He said, “ ‘You will hear but never understand. You will see but never know what you are seeing."
Matthew,13,15,"The hearts of these people have become stubborn. They can barely hear with their ears. They have closed their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes. They might hear with their ears. They might understand with their hearts. They might turn to the Lord, and then he would heal them.’( Isaiah 6:9, 10)"
Matthew,13,16,But blessed are your eyes because they see. And blessed are your ears because they hear.
Matthew,13,17,What I’m about to tell you is true. Many prophets and godly people wanted to see what you see. But they didn’t see it. They wanted to hear what you hear. But they didn’t hear it.
Matthew,13,18,“Listen! Here is the meaning of the story of the farmer.
Matthew,13,19,People hear the message about the kingdom but do not understand it. Then the evil one comes. He steals what was planted in their hearts. Those people are like the seed planted on a path.
Matthew,13,20,The seed that fell on rocky places is like other people. They hear the message and at once receive it with joy.
Matthew,13,21,But they have no roots. So they last only a short time. They quickly fall away from the faith when trouble or suffering comes because of the message.
Matthew,13,22,The seed that fell among the thorns is like others who hear the message. But then the worries of this life and the false promises of wealth crowd it out. They keep the message from producing fruit.
Matthew,13,23,"But the seed that fell on good soil is like those who hear the message and understand it. They produce a crop 100, 60 or 30 times more than the farmer planted.”"
Matthew,13,24,"Jesus told the crowd another story. “Here is what the kingdom of heaven is like,” he said. “A man planted good seed in his field."
Matthew,13,25,"But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came. The enemy planted weeds among the wheat and then went away."
Matthew,13,26,"The wheat began to grow and form grain. At the same time, weeds appeared."
Matthew,13,27,"“The owner’s slaves came to him. They said, ‘Sir, didn’t you plant good seed in your field? Then where did the weeds come from?’"
Matthew,13,28,"“ ‘An enemy did this,’ he replied. “The slaves asked him, ‘Do you want us to go and pull up the weeds?’"
Matthew,13,29,"“ ‘No,’ the owner answered. ‘While you are pulling up the weeds, you might pull up the wheat with them."
Matthew,13,30,Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the workers what to do. Here is what I will say to them. First collect the weeds. Tie them in bundles to be burned. Then gather the wheat. Bring it into my storeroom.’ ”
Matthew,13,31,"Jesus told the crowd another story. He said, “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. Someone took the seed and planted it in a field."
Matthew,13,32,"It is the smallest of all seeds. But when it grows, it is the largest of all garden plants. It becomes a tree. Birds come and rest in its branches.”"
Matthew,13,33,"Jesus told them still another story. “The kingdom of heaven is like yeast,” he said. “A woman mixed it into 60 pounds of flour. The yeast worked its way all through the dough.”"
Matthew,13,34,Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd using stories. He did not say anything to them without telling a story.
Matthew,13,35,"So the words spoken by the prophet came true. He had said, “I will open my mouth and tell stories. I will speak about things that were hidden since the world was made.”( Psalm 78:2)"
Matthew,13,36,"Then Jesus left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him. They said, “Explain to us the story of the weeds in the field.”"
Matthew,13,37,"He answered, “The one who planted the good seed is the Son of Man."
Matthew,13,38,The field is the world. The good seed stands for the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are the people who belong to the evil one.
Matthew,13,39,The enemy who plants them is the devil. The harvest is judgment day. And the workers are angels.
Matthew,13,40,“The weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire. That is how it will be on judgment day.
Matthew,13,41,The Son of Man will send out his angels. They will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin. They will also get rid of all who do evil.
Matthew,13,42,They will throw them into the blazing furnace. There people will weep and grind their teeth.
Matthew,13,43,Then God’s people will shine like the sun in their Father’s kingdom. Whoever has ears should listen.
Matthew,13,44,"“The kingdom of heaven is like treasure that was hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again. He was very happy. So he went and sold everything he had. And he bought that field."
Matthew,13,45,"“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a trader who was looking for fine pearls."
Matthew,13,46,He found one that was very valuable. So he went away and sold everything he had. And he bought that pearl.
Matthew,13,47,"“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net. It was let down into the lake. It caught all kinds of fish."
Matthew,13,48,"When it was full, the fishermen pulled it up on the shore. Then they sat down and gathered the good fish into baskets. But they threw the bad fish away."
Matthew,13,49,This is how it will be on judgment day. The angels will come. They will separate the people who did what is wrong from those who did what is right.
Matthew,13,50,They will throw the evil people into the blazing furnace. There the evil ones will weep and grind their teeth.
Matthew,13,51,"“Do you understand all these things?” Jesus asked. “Yes,” they replied."
Matthew,13,52,"He said to them, “Every teacher of the law who has become a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house. He brings new treasures out of his storeroom as well as old ones.”"
Matthew,13,53,Jesus finished telling these stories. Then he moved on from there.
Matthew,13,54,He came to his hometown of Nazareth. There he began teaching the people in their synagogue. They were amazed. “Where did this man get this wisdom? Where did he get this power to do miracles?” they asked.
Matthew,13,55,"“Isn’t this the carpenter’s son? Isn’t his mother’s name Mary? Aren’t his brothers James, Joseph, Simon and Judas?"
Matthew,13,56,Aren’t all his sisters with us? Then where did this man get all these things?”
Matthew,13,57,"They were not pleased with him at all. But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is honored everywhere except in his own town and in his own home.”"
Matthew,13,58,He did only a few miracles in Nazareth because the people there had no faith.
Matthew,14,1,"At that time Herod, the ruler of Galilee and Perea, heard reports about Jesus."
Matthew,14,2,"He said to his attendants, “This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to do miracles.”"
Matthew,14,3,Herod had arrested John. He had tied him up and put him in prison because of Herodias. She was the wife of Herod’s brother Philip.
Matthew,14,4,"John had been saying to Herod, “It is against the Law for you to have her as your wife.”"
Matthew,14,5,"Herod wanted to kill John. But he was afraid of the people, because they thought John was a prophet."
Matthew,14,6,On Herod’s birthday the daughter of Herodias danced for Herod and his guests. She pleased Herod very much.
Matthew,14,7,So he promised to give her anything she asked for.
Matthew,14,8,"Her mother told her what to say. So the girl said to Herod, “Give me the head of John the Baptist on a big plate.”"
Matthew,14,9,The king was very upset. But he thought of his promise and his dinner guests. So he told one of his men to give her what she asked for.
Matthew,14,10,Herod had John’s head cut off in the prison.
Matthew,14,11,His head was brought in on a big plate and given to the girl. She then carried it to her mother.
Matthew,14,12,John’s disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus.
Matthew,14,13,Jesus heard what had happened to John. He wanted to be alone. So he went in a boat to a quiet place. The crowds heard about this. They followed him on foot from the towns.
Matthew,14,14,"When Jesus came ashore, he saw a large crowd. He felt deep concern for them. He healed their sick people."
Matthew,14,15,"When it was almost evening, the disciples came to him. “There is nothing here,” they said. “It’s already getting late. Send the crowds away. They can go and buy some food in the villages.”"
Matthew,14,16,"Jesus replied, “They don’t need to go away. You give them something to eat.”"
Matthew,14,17,"“We have only five loaves of bread and two fish,” they answered."
Matthew,14,18,"“Bring them here to me,” he said."
Matthew,14,19,Then Jesus directed the people to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish. He looked up to heaven and gave thanks. He broke the loaves into pieces. Then he gave them to the disciples. And the disciples gave them to the people.
Matthew,14,20,All of them ate and were satisfied. The disciples picked up 12 baskets of leftover pieces.
Matthew,14,21,"The number of men who ate was about 5,000. Women and children also ate."
Matthew,14,22,Right away Jesus made the disciples get into the boat. He had them go on ahead of him to the other side of the Sea of Galilee. Then he sent the crowd away.
Matthew,14,23,"After he had sent them away, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. Later that night, he was there alone."
Matthew,14,24,The boat was already a long way from land. It was being pounded by the waves because the wind was blowing against it.
Matthew,14,25,"Shortly before dawn, Jesus went out to the disciples. He walked on the lake."
Matthew,14,26,They saw him walking on the lake and were terrified. “It’s a ghost!” they said. And they cried out in fear.
Matthew,14,27,"Right away Jesus called out to them, “Be brave! It is I. Don’t be afraid.”"
Matthew,14,28,"“Lord, is it you?” Peter asked. “If it is, tell me to come to you on the water.”"
Matthew,14,29,"“Come,” Jesus said. So Peter got out of the boat. He walked on the water toward Jesus."
Matthew,14,30,"But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid. He began to sink. He cried out, “Lord! Save me!”"
Matthew,14,31,Right away Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. “Your faith is so small!” he said. “Why did you doubt me?”
Matthew,14,32,"When they climbed into the boat, the wind died down."
Matthew,14,33,"Then those in the boat worshiped Jesus. They said, “You really are the Son of God!”"
Matthew,14,34,They crossed over the lake and landed at Gennesaret.
Matthew,14,35,The men who lived there recognized Jesus. So they sent a message all over the nearby countryside. People brought all those who were sick to Jesus.
Matthew,14,36,They begged him to let those who were sick just touch the edge of his clothes. And all who touched his clothes were healed.
Matthew,15,1,"Some Pharisees and some teachers of the law came from Jerusalem to see Jesus. They asked,"
Matthew,15,2,“Why don’t your disciples obey what the elders teach? Your disciples don’t wash their hands before they eat!”
Matthew,15,3,"Jesus replied, “And why don’t you obey God’s command? You would rather follow your own teachings!"
Matthew,15,4,"God said, ‘Honor your father and mother.’( Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16) He also said, ‘Anyone who asks for bad things to happen to their father or mother must be put to death.’( Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9)"
Matthew,15,5,But suppose people have something that might be used to help their parents. You allow them to say it is instead ‘a gift set apart for God.’
Matthew,15,6,So they do not need to honor their father or mother with their gift. You make the word of God useless in order to follow your own teachings.
Matthew,15,7,"You pretenders! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you. He said,"
Matthew,15,8,“ ‘These people honor me by what they say. But their hearts are far away from me.
Matthew,15,9,Their worship doesn’t mean anything to me. They teach nothing but human rules.’ ”( Isaiah 29:13)
Matthew,15,10,"Jesus called the crowd to him. He said, “Listen and understand."
Matthew,15,11,What goes into someone’s mouth does not make them ‘unclean.’ It’s what comes out of their mouth that makes them ‘unclean.’ ”
Matthew,15,12,"Then the disciples came to him. They asked, “Do you know that the Pharisees were angry when they heard this?”"
Matthew,15,13,"Jesus replied, “They are plants that my Father in heaven has not planted. They will be pulled up by the roots."
Matthew,15,14,"Leave the Pharisees. They are blind guides. If one blind person leads another blind person, both of them will fall into a pit.”"
Matthew,15,15,"Peter said, “Explain this to us.”"
Matthew,15,16,“Don’t you understand yet?” Jesus asked them.
Matthew,15,17,“Don’t you see? Everything that enters the mouth goes into the stomach. Then it goes out of the body.
Matthew,15,18,But the things that come out of a person’s mouth come from the heart. Those are the things that make someone ‘unclean.’
Matthew,15,19,"Evil thoughts come out of a person’s heart. So do murder, adultery, and other sexual sins. And so do stealing, false witness, and telling lies about others."
Matthew,15,20,Those are the things that make you ‘unclean.’ But eating without washing your hands does not make you ‘unclean.’ ”
Matthew,15,21,Jesus left Galilee and went to the area of Tyre and Sidon.
Matthew,15,22,"A woman from Canaan lived near Tyre and Sidon. She came to him and cried out, “Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on me! A demon controls my daughter. She is suffering terribly.”"
Matthew,15,23,"Jesus did not say a word. So his disciples came to him. They begged him, “Send her away. She keeps crying out after us.”"
Matthew,15,24,"Jesus answered, “I was sent only to the people of Israel. They are like lost sheep.”"
Matthew,15,25,Then the woman fell to her knees in front of him. “Lord! Help me!” she said.
Matthew,15,26,"He replied, “It is not right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”"
Matthew,15,27,"“Yes it is, Lord,” she said. “Even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their owner’s table.”"
Matthew,15,28,"Then Jesus said to her, “Woman, you have great faith! You will be given what you are asking for.” And her daughter was healed at that moment."
Matthew,15,29,Jesus left there. He walked along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a mountainside and sat down.
Matthew,15,30,"Large crowds came to him. They brought blind people and those who could not walk. They also brought disabled people, those who could not speak, and many others. They laid them at his feet, and he healed them."
Matthew,15,31,The people were amazed. Those who could not speak were speaking. The disabled were made well. Those not able to walk were walking. Those who were blind could see. So the people praised the God of Israel.
Matthew,15,32,"Then Jesus called for his disciples to come to him. He said, “I feel deep concern for these people. They have already been with me three days. They don’t have anything to eat. I don’t want to send them away hungry. If I do, they will become too weak on their way home.”"
Matthew,15,33,"His disciples answered him. “There is nothing here,” they said. “Where could we get enough bread to feed this large crowd?”"
Matthew,15,34,"“How many loaves do you have?” Jesus asked. “Seven,” they replied, “and a few small fish.”"
Matthew,15,35,Jesus told the crowd to sit down on the ground.
Matthew,15,36,He took the seven loaves and the fish and gave thanks. Then he broke them and gave them to the disciples. And the disciples passed them out to the people.
Matthew,15,37,"All of them ate and were satisfied. After that, the disciples picked up seven baskets of leftover pieces."
Matthew,15,38,"The number of men who ate was 4,000. Women and children also ate."
Matthew,15,39,"After Jesus had sent the crowd away, he got into the boat. He went to the area near Magadan."
Matthew,16,1,The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus. They asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
Matthew,16,2,"He replied, “In the evening you look at the sky. You say, ‘It will be good weather. The sky is red.’"
Matthew,16,3,"And in the morning you say, ‘Today it will be stormy. The sky is red and cloudy.’ You know the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you can’t understand the signs of what is happening right now."
Matthew,16,4,An evil and unfaithful people look for a sign. But none will be given to them except the sign of Jonah.” Then Jesus left them and went away.
Matthew,16,5,The disciples crossed over to the other side of the lake. They had forgotten to take bread.
Matthew,16,6,"“Be careful,” Jesus said to them. “Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”"
Matthew,16,7,"The disciples talked about this among themselves. They said, “He must be saying this because we didn’t bring any bread.”"
Matthew,16,8,"Jesus knew what they were saying. So he said, “Your faith is so small! Why are you talking to each other about having no bread?"
Matthew,16,9,"Don’t you understand yet? Don’t you remember the five loaves for the 5,000? Don’t you remember how many baskets of pieces you gathered?"
Matthew,16,10,"Don’t you remember the seven loaves for the 4,000? Don’t you remember how many baskets of pieces you gathered?"
Matthew,16,11,How can you possibly not understand? I wasn’t talking to you about bread. But watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”
Matthew,16,12,Then the disciples understood that Jesus was not telling them to watch out for the yeast used in bread. He was warning them against what the Pharisees and Sadducees taught.
Matthew,16,13,"Jesus went to the area of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, “Who do people say the Son of Man is?”"
Matthew,16,14,"They replied, “Some say John the Baptist. Others say Elijah. Still others say Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.”"
Matthew,16,15,“But what about you?” he asked. “Who do you say I am?”
Matthew,16,16,"Simon Peter answered, “You are the Messiah. You are the Son of the living God.”"
Matthew,16,17,"Jesus replied, “Blessed are you, Simon, son of Jonah! No mere human showed this to you. My Father in heaven showed it to you."
Matthew,16,18,Here is what I tell you. You are Peter. On this rock I will build my church. The gates of hell will not be strong enough to destroy it.
Matthew,16,19,I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. What you lock on earth will be locked in heaven. What you unlock on earth will be unlocked in heaven.”
Matthew,16,20,Then Jesus ordered his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah.
Matthew,16,21,"From that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples what would happen to him. He told them he must go to Jerusalem. There he must suffer many things from the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law. He must be killed and on the third day rise to life again."
Matthew,16,22,"Peter took Jesus to one side and began to scold him. “Never, Lord!” he said. “This will never happen to you!”"
Matthew,16,23,"Jesus turned and said to Peter, “Get behind me, Satan! You are standing in my way. You do not have in mind the things God cares about. Instead, you only have in mind the things humans care about.”"
Matthew,16,24,"Then Jesus spoke to his disciples. He said, “Whoever wants to be my disciple must say no to themselves. They must pick up their cross and follow me."
Matthew,16,25,Whoever wants to save their life will lose it. But whoever loses their life for me will find it.
Matthew,16,26,What good is it if someone gains the whole world but loses their soul? Or what can anyone trade for their soul?
Matthew,16,27,The Son of Man is going to come in his Father’s glory. His angels will come with him. And he will reward everyone in keeping with what they have done.
Matthew,16,28,“What I’m about to tell you is true. Some who are standing here will not die before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.”
Matthew,17,1,"After six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John the brother of James with him. He led them up a high mountain. They were all alone."
Matthew,17,2,There in front of them his appearance was changed. His face shone like the sun. His clothes became as white as the light.
Matthew,17,3,Just then Moses and Elijah appeared in front of them. Moses and Elijah were talking with Jesus.
Matthew,17,4,"Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will put up three shelters. One will be for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”"
Matthew,17,5,"While Peter was still speaking, a bright cloud covered them. A voice from the cloud said, “This is my Son, and I love him. I am very pleased with him. Listen to him!”"
Matthew,17,6,"When the disciples heard this, they were terrified. They fell with their faces to the ground."
Matthew,17,7,"But Jesus came and touched them. “Get up,” he said. “Don’t be afraid.”"
Matthew,17,8,"When they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus."
Matthew,17,9,"They came down the mountain. On the way down, Jesus told them what to do. “Don’t tell anyone what you have seen,” he said. “Wait until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.”"
Matthew,17,10,"The disciples asked him, “Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah has to come first?”"
Matthew,17,11,"Jesus replied, “That’s right. Elijah is supposed to come and make all things new again."
Matthew,17,12,"But I tell you, Elijah has already come. People didn’t recognize him. They have done to him everything they wanted to do. In the same way, they are going to make the Son of Man suffer.”"
Matthew,17,13,Then the disciples understood that Jesus was talking to them about John the Baptist.
Matthew,17,14,"When they came near the crowd, a man approached Jesus. He got on his knees in front of him."
Matthew,17,15,"“Lord,” he said, “have mercy on my son. He shakes wildly and suffers a great deal. He often falls into the fire or into the water."
Matthew,17,16,I brought him to your disciples. But they couldn’t heal him.”
Matthew,17,17,“You unbelieving and evil people!” Jesus replied. “How long do I have to stay with you? How long do I have to put up with you? Bring the boy here to me.”
Matthew,17,18,"Jesus ordered the demon to leave the boy, and it came out of him. He was healed at that moment."
Matthew,17,19,"Then the disciples came to Jesus in private. They asked, “Why couldn’t we drive out the demon?”"
Matthew,18,1,"At that time the disciples came to Jesus. They asked him, “Then who is the most important person in the kingdom of heaven?”"
Matthew,18,2,Jesus called a little child over to him. He had the child stand among them.
Matthew,18,3,"Jesus said, “What I’m about to tell you is true. You need to change and become like little children. If you don’t, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
Matthew,18,4,Anyone who takes the humble position of this child is the most important in the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew,18,5,Anyone who welcomes a little child like this one in my name welcomes me.
Matthew,18,6,"“What if someone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin? If they do, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and be drowned at the bottom of the sea."
Matthew,18,7,How terrible it will be for the world because of the things that cause people to sin! Things like that must come. But how terrible for the person who causes them!
Matthew,18,8,"If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It would be better to enter the kingdom of heaven with only one hand than go into hell with two hands. It would be better to enter the kingdom of heaven with only one foot than go into hell with two feet. In hell the fire burns forever."
Matthew,18,9,"If your eye causes you to sin, poke it out and throw it away. It would be better to enter the kingdom of heaven with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell."
Matthew,19,1,"When Jesus finished saying these things, he left Galilee. He went into the area of Judea on the other side of the Jordan River."
Matthew,19,2,Large crowds followed him. He healed them there.
Matthew,19,3,"Some Pharisees came to test Jesus. They asked, “Does the Law allow a man to divorce his wife for any reason at all?”"
Matthew,19,4,"Jesus replied, “Haven’t you read that in the beginning the Creator ‘made them male and female’?( Genesis 1:27)"
Matthew,19,5,"He said, ‘That’s why a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife. The two will become one.’( Genesis 2:24)"
Matthew,19,6,"They are no longer two, but one. So no one should separate what God has joined together.”"
Matthew,19,7,"They asked, “Then why did Moses command that a man can give his wife a letter of divorce and send her away?”"
Matthew,19,8,"Jesus replied, “Moses let you divorce your wives because you were stubborn. But it was not this way from the beginning."
Matthew,19,9,Here is what I tell you. Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery. A man may divorce his wife only if she has not been faithful to him.”
Matthew,19,10,"Here is what the disciples said to him. “If that’s the way it is between a husband and wife, it is better not to get married.”"
Matthew,19,11,"Jesus replied, “Not everyone can accept the idea of staying single. Only those who have been helped to live without getting married can accept it."
Matthew,19,12,Some men are not able to have children because they were born that way. Some have been made that way by other people. Others have chosen to live that way in order to serve the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it.”
Matthew,19,13,Some people brought little children to Jesus. They wanted him to place his hands on the children and pray for them. But the disciples told them not to do it.
Matthew,19,14,"Jesus said, “Let the little children come to me. Don’t keep them away. The kingdom of heaven belongs to people like them.”"
Matthew,19,15,Jesus placed his hands on them to bless them. Then he went on from there.
Matthew,19,16,"Just then, a man came up to Jesus. He asked, “Teacher, what good thing must I do to receive eternal life?”"
Matthew,19,17,"“Why do you ask me about what is good?” Jesus replied. “There is only one who is good. If you want to enter the kingdom, obey the commandments.”"
Matthew,19,18,"“Which ones?” the man asked. Jesus said, “ ‘Do not murder. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not be a false witness."
Matthew,19,19,Honor your father and mother.’( Exodus 20:12–16; Deuteronomy 5:16–20) And ‘love your neighbor as you love yourself.’ ”( Leviticus 19:18)
Matthew,19,20,"“I have obeyed all those commandments,” the young man said. “What else do I need to do?”"
Matthew,19,21,"Jesus answered, “If you want to be perfect, go and sell everything you have. Give the money to those who are poor. You will have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me.”"
Matthew,19,22,"When the young man heard this, he went away sad. He was very rich."
Matthew,19,23,"Then Jesus said to his disciples, “What I’m about to tell you is true. It is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
Matthew,19,24,"Again I tell you, it is hard for a camel to go through the eye of a needle. But it is even harder for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.”"
Matthew,19,25,"When the disciples heard this, they were really amazed. They asked, “Then who can be saved?”"
Matthew,19,26,"Jesus looked at them and said, “With people, this is impossible. But with God, all things are possible.”"
Matthew,19,27,"Peter answered him, “We have left everything to follow you! What reward will be given to us?”"
Matthew,19,28,"“What I’m about to tell you is true,” Jesus said to them. “When all things are made new, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne. Then you who have followed me will also sit on 12 thrones. You will judge the 12 tribes of Israel."
Matthew,19,29,"Suppose anyone has left houses, brothers or sisters, father or mother, husband or wife, children or fields because of me. Anyone who has done that will receive 100 times as much. They will also receive eternal life."
Matthew,19,30,But many who are first will be last. And many who are last will be first.
Matthew,20,1,“The kingdom of heaven is like a man who owned land. He went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
Matthew,20,2,He agreed to give them the usual pay for a day’s work. Then he sent them into his vineyard.
Matthew,20,3,“About nine o’clock in the morning he went out again. He saw others standing in the market doing nothing.
Matthew,20,4,"He told them, ‘You also go and work in my vineyard. I’ll pay you what is right.’"
Matthew,20,5,So they went. “He went out again about noon and at three o’clock and did the same thing.
Matthew,20,6,"About five o’clock he went out and found still others standing around. He asked them, ‘Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing?’"
Matthew,20,7,"“ ‘Because no one has hired us,’ they answered. “He said to them, ‘You also go and work in my vineyard.’"
Matthew,20,8,"“When evening came, the owner of the vineyard spoke to the person who was in charge of the workers. He said, ‘Call the workers and give them their pay. Begin with the last ones I hired. Then go on to the first ones.’"
Matthew,20,9,“The workers who were hired about five o’clock came. Each received the usual day’s pay.
Matthew,20,10,"So when those who were hired first came, they expected to receive more. But each of them also received the usual day’s pay."
Matthew,20,11,"When they received it, they began to complain about the owner."
Matthew,20,12,"‘These people who were hired last worked only one hour,’ they said. ‘You have paid them the same as us. We have done most of the work and have been in the hot sun all day.’"
Matthew,20,13,"“The owner answered one of them. ‘Friend,’ he said, ‘I’m being fair to you. Didn’t you agree to work for the usual day’s pay?"
Matthew,20,14,Take your money and go. I want to give the one I hired last the same pay I gave you.
Matthew,20,15,Don’t I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Do you feel cheated because I gave so freely to the others?’
Matthew,20,16,“So those who are last will be first. And those who are first will be last.”
Matthew,20,17,"Jesus was going up to Jerusalem. On the way, he took his 12 disciples to one side to talk to them."
Matthew,20,18,"“We are going up to Jerusalem,” he said. “The Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will sentence him to death."
Matthew,20,19,"Then they will hand him over to the Gentiles. The people will make fun of him and whip him. They will nail him to a cross. On the third day, he will rise from the dead!”"
Matthew,20,20,"The mother of Zebedee’s sons came to Jesus. Her sons came with her. Getting on her knees, she asked a favor of him."
Matthew,20,21,"“What do you want?” Jesus asked. She said, “Promise me that one of my two sons may sit at your right hand in your kingdom. Promise that the other one may sit at your left hand.”"
Matthew,20,22,"“You don’t know what you’re asking for,” Jesus said to them. “Can you drink the cup of suffering I am going to drink?” “We can,” they answered."
Matthew,20,23,"Jesus said to them, “You will certainly drink from my cup. But it is not for me to say who will sit at my right or left hand. These places belong to those my Father has prepared them for.”"
Matthew,20,24,The other ten disciples heard about this. They became angry at the two brothers.
Matthew,20,25,"Jesus called them together. He said, “You know about the rulers of the Gentiles. They hold power over their people. Their high officials order them around."
Matthew,20,26,"Don’t be like that. Instead, anyone who wants to be important among you must be your servant."
Matthew,20,27,And anyone who wants to be first must be your slave.
Matthew,20,28,"Be like the Son of Man. He did not come to be served. Instead, he came to serve others. He came to give his life as the price for setting many people free.”"
Matthew,20,29,Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho. A large crowd followed him.
Matthew,20,30,"Two blind men were sitting by the side of the road. They heard that Jesus was going by. So they shouted, “Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!”"
Matthew,20,31,"The crowd commanded them to stop. They told them to be quiet. But the two men shouted even louder, “Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!”"
Matthew,20,32,Jesus stopped and called out to them. “What do you want me to do for you?” he asked.
Matthew,20,33,"“Lord,” they answered, “we want to be able to see.”"
Matthew,20,34,Jesus felt deep concern for them. He touched their eyes. Right away they could see. And they followed him.
Matthew,21,1,"As they all approached Jerusalem, they came to Bethphage. It was on the Mount of Olives. Jesus sent out two disciples."
Matthew,21,2,"He said to them, “Go to the village ahead of you. As soon as you get there, you will find a donkey tied up. Her colt will be with her. Untie them and bring them to me."
Matthew,21,3,"If anyone says anything to you, say that the Lord needs them. The owner will send them right away.”"
Matthew,21,4,"This took place so that what was spoken through the prophet would come true. It says,"
Matthew,21,5,"“Say to the city of Zion, ‘See, your king comes to you. He is gentle and riding on a donkey. He is riding on a donkey’s colt.’ ”( Zechariah 9:9)"
Matthew,21,6,The disciples went and did what Jesus told them to do.
Matthew,21,7,They brought the donkey and the colt. They placed their coats on them for Jesus to sit on.
Matthew,21,8,A very large crowd spread their coats on the road. Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
Matthew,21,9,"Some of the people went ahead of him, and some followed. They all shouted, “Hosanna to the Son of David!” “Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!”( Psalm 118:26) “Hosanna in the highest heaven!”"
Matthew,21,10,"When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up. The people asked, “Who is this?”"
Matthew,21,11,"The crowds answered, “This is Jesus. He is the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.”"
Matthew,21,12,Jesus entered the temple courtyard. He began to drive out all those who were buying and selling there. He turned over the tables of the people who were exchanging money. He also turned over the benches of those who were selling doves.
Matthew,21,13,"He said to them, “It is written that the Lord said, ‘My house will be called a house where people can pray.’( Isaiah 56:7) But you are making it ‘a den for robbers.’ ”( Jeremiah 7:11)"
Matthew,21,14,Blind people and those who were disabled came to Jesus at the temple. There he healed them.
Matthew,21,15,"The chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did. They also saw the children in the temple courtyard shouting, “Hosanna to the Son of David!” But when they saw all this, they became angry."
Matthew,21,16,"“Do you hear what these children are saying?” they asked him. “Yes,” replied Jesus. “Haven’t you ever read about it in Scripture? It says, “ ‘Lord, you have made sure that children and infants praise you.’ ”( Psalm 8:2)"
Matthew,21,17,Then Jesus left the people and went out of the city to Bethany. He spent the night there.
Matthew,21,18,"Early in the morning, Jesus was on his way back to Jerusalem. He was hungry."
Matthew,21,19,"He saw a fig tree by the road. He went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves. Then he said to it, “May you never bear fruit again!” Right away the tree dried up."
Matthew,21,20,"When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. “How did the fig tree dry up so quickly?” they asked."
Matthew,21,21,"Jesus replied, “What I’m about to tell you is true. You must have faith and not doubt. Then you can do what was done to the fig tree. And you can say to this mountain, ‘Go and throw yourself into the sea.’ It will be done."
Matthew,21,22,"If you believe, you will receive what you ask for when you pray.”"
Matthew,21,23,"Jesus entered the temple courtyard. While he was teaching there, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him. “By what authority are you doing these things?” they asked. “Who gave you this authority?”"
Matthew,21,24,"Jesus replied, “I will also ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things."
Matthew,21,25,"Where did John’s baptism come from? Was it from heaven? Or did it come from human authority?” They talked to one another about it. They said, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask, ‘Then why didn’t you believe him?’"
Matthew,21,26,"But what if we say, ‘From human authority’? We are afraid of the people. Everyone believes that John was a prophet.”"
Matthew,21,27,"So they answered Jesus, “We don’t know.” Jesus said, “Then I won’t tell you by what authority I am doing these things either."
Matthew,21,28,"“What do you think about this? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, ‘Son, go and work today in the vineyard.’"
Matthew,21,29,"“ ‘I will not,’ the son answered. But later he changed his mind and went."
Matthew,21,30,"“Then the father went to the other son. He said the same thing. The son answered, ‘I will, sir.’ But he did not go."
Matthew,21,31,"“Which of the two sons did what his father wanted?” “The first,” they answered. Jesus said to them, “What I’m about to tell you is true. Tax collectors and prostitutes will enter the kingdom of God ahead of you."
Matthew,21,32,John came to show you the right way to live. And you did not believe him. But the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. You saw this. But even then you did not turn away from your sins and believe him.
Matthew,21,33,“Listen to another story. A man who owned some land planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it. He dug a pit for a winepress in it. He also built a lookout tower. He rented the vineyard out to some farmers. Then he moved to another place.
Matthew,21,34,"When harvest time approached, he sent his slaves to the renters. He told the slaves to collect his share of the fruit."
Matthew,21,35,“But the renters grabbed his slaves. They beat one of them. They killed another. They threw stones at the third to kill him.
Matthew,21,36,Then the man sent other slaves to the renters. He sent more than he did the first time. The renters treated them the same way.
Matthew,21,37,"Last of all, he sent his son to them. ‘They will respect my son,’ he said."
Matthew,21,38,"“But the renters saw the son coming. They said to one another, ‘This is the one who will receive all the owner’s property someday. Come, let’s kill him. Then everything will be ours.’"
Matthew,21,39,So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard. Then they killed him.
Matthew,21,40,"“When the owner of the vineyard comes back, what will he do to those renters?”"
Matthew,21,41,"“He will destroy those evil people,” they replied. “Then he will rent the vineyard out to other renters. They will give him his share of the crop at harvest time.”"
Matthew,21,42,"Jesus said to them, “Haven’t you ever read what the Scriptures say, “ ‘The stone the builders didn’t accept has become the most important stone of all. The Lord has done it. It is wonderful in our eyes’?( Psalm 118:22, 23)"
Matthew,21,43,“So here is what I tell you. The kingdom of God will be taken away from you. It will be given to people who will produce its fruit.
Matthew,21,44,Anyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces. But the stone will crush anyone it falls on.”
Matthew,21,45,The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus’ stories. They knew he was talking about them.
Matthew,21,46,So they looked for a way to arrest him. But they were afraid of the crowd. The people believed that Jesus was a prophet.
Matthew,22,1,"Jesus told them more stories. He said,"
Matthew,22,2,“Here is what the kingdom of heaven is like. A king prepared a wedding dinner for his son.
Matthew,22,3,He sent his slaves to those who had been invited to the dinner. The slaves told them to come. But they refused.
Matthew,22,4,"“Then he sent some more slaves. He said, ‘Tell those who were invited that I have prepared my dinner. I have killed my oxen and my fattest cattle. Everything is ready. Come to the wedding dinner.’"
Matthew,22,5,“But the people paid no attention. One went away to his field. Another went away to his business.
Matthew,22,6,The rest grabbed his slaves. They treated them badly and then killed them.
Matthew,22,7,The king became very angry. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed those murderers and burned their city.
Matthew,22,8,"“Then the king said to his slaves, ‘The wedding dinner is ready. But those I invited were not fit to come."
Matthew,22,9,So go to the street corners. Invite to the dinner anyone you can find.’
Matthew,22,10,"So the slaves went out into the streets. They gathered all the people they could find, the bad as well as the good. Soon the wedding hall was filled with guests."
Matthew,22,11,“The king came in to see the guests. He noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.
Matthew,22,12,"‘Friend,’ he asked, ‘how did you get in here without wedding clothes?’ The man couldn’t think of anything to say."
Matthew,22,13,"“Then the king told his slaves, ‘Tie up his hands and feet. Throw him outside into the darkness. Out there people will weep and grind their teeth.’"
Matthew,22,14,"“Many are invited, but few are chosen.”"
Matthew,22,15,The Pharisees went out. They made plans to trap Jesus with his own words.
Matthew,22,16,"They sent their followers to him. They sent the Herodians with them. “Teacher,” they said, “we know that you are a man of honor. You teach the way of God truthfully. You don’t let others tell you what to do or say. You don’t care how important they are."
Matthew,22,17,"Tell us then, what do you think? Is it right to pay the royal tax to Caesar or not?”"
Matthew,22,18,"But Jesus knew their evil plans. He said, “You pretenders! Why are you trying to trap me?"
Matthew,22,19,Show me the coin people use for paying the tax.” They brought him a silver coin.
Matthew,22,20,"He asked them, “Whose picture is this? And whose words?”"
Matthew,22,21,"“Caesar’s,” they replied. Then he said to them, “So give back to Caesar what belongs to Caesar. And give back to God what belongs to God.”"
Matthew,22,22,"When they heard this, they were amazed. So they left him and went away."
Matthew,22,23,That same day the Sadducees came to Jesus with a question. They do not believe that people rise from the dead.
Matthew,22,24,"“Teacher,” they said, “here is what Moses told us. If a man dies without having children, his brother must get married to the widow. He must provide children to carry on his brother’s name."
Matthew,22,25,"There were seven brothers among us. The first one got married and died. Since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother."
Matthew,22,26,The same thing happened to the second and third brothers. It happened right on down to the seventh brother.
Matthew,22,27,"Finally, the woman died."
Matthew,22,28,"Now then, when the dead rise, whose wife will she be? All seven of them were married to her.”"
Matthew,22,29,"Jesus replied, “You are mistaken, because you do not know the Scriptures. And you do not know the power of God."
Matthew,22,30,"When the dead rise, they won’t get married. And their parents won’t give them to be married. They will be like the angels in heaven."
Matthew,22,31,What about the dead rising? Haven’t you read what God said to you?
Matthew,22,32,"He said, ‘I am the God of Abraham. I am the God of Isaac. And I am the God of Jacob.’( Exodus 3:6) He is not the God of the dead. He is the God of the living.”"
Matthew,22,33,"When the crowds heard this, they were amazed by what he taught."
Matthew,22,34,The Pharisees heard that the Sadducees weren’t able to answer Jesus. So the Pharisees got together.
Matthew,22,35,One of them was an authority on the law. So he tested Jesus with a question.
Matthew,22,36,"“Teacher,” he asked, “which is the most important commandment in the Law?”"
Matthew,22,37,"Jesus replied, “ ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul. Love him with all your mind.’( Deuteronomy 6:5)"
Matthew,22,38,This is the first and most important commandment.
Matthew,22,39,And the second is like it. ‘Love your neighbor as you love yourself.’( Leviticus 19:18)
Matthew,22,40,Everything that is written in the Law and the Prophets is based on these two commandments.”
Matthew,22,41,"The Pharisees were gathered together. Jesus asked them,"
Matthew,22,42,"“What do you think about the Messiah? Whose son is he?” “The son of David,” they replied."
Matthew,22,43,"He said to them, “Then why does David call him ‘Lord’? The Holy Spirit spoke through David himself. David said,"
Matthew,22,44,"“ ‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your control.” ’( Psalm 110:1)"
Matthew,22,45,"So if David calls him ‘Lord,’ how can he be David’s son?”"
Matthew,22,46,"No one could give any answer to him. From that day on, no one dared to ask him any more questions."
Matthew,23,1,Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples.
Matthew,23,2,"“The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat,” he said."
Matthew,23,3,“So you must be careful to do everything they say. But don’t do what they do. They don’t practice what they preach.
Matthew,23,4,They tie up heavy loads that are hard to carry. Then they put them on other people’s shoulders. But they themselves aren’t willing to lift a finger to move them.
Matthew,23,5,“Everything they do is done for others to see. On their foreheads and arms they wear little boxes that hold Scripture verses. They make the boxes very wide. And they make the tassels on their coats very long.
Matthew,23,6,They love to sit down in the place of honor at dinners. They also love to have the most important seats in the synagogues.
Matthew,23,7,They love to be greeted with respect in the markets. They love it when people call them ‘Rabbi.’
Matthew,23,8,"“But you shouldn’t be called ‘Rabbi.’ You have only one Teacher, and you are all brothers."
Matthew,23,9,"Do not call anyone on earth ‘father.’ You have one Father, and he is in heaven."
Matthew,23,10,"You shouldn’t be called ‘teacher.’ You have one Teacher, and he is the Messiah."
Matthew,23,11,The most important person among you will be your servant.
Matthew,23,12,People who lift themselves up will be made humble. And people who make themselves humble will be lifted up.
Matthew,24,1,Jesus left the temple. He was walking away when his disciples came up to him. They wanted to call his attention to the temple buildings.
Matthew,24,2,“Do you see all these things?” Jesus asked. “What I’m about to tell you is true. Not one stone here will be left on top of another. Every stone will be thrown down.”
Matthew,24,3,"Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. There the disciples came to him in private. “Tell us,” they said. “When will this happen? And what will be the sign of your coming? What will be the sign of the end?”"
Matthew,24,4,"Jesus answered, “Keep watch! Be careful that no one fools you."
Matthew,24,5,"Many will come in my name. They will claim, ‘I am the Messiah!’ They will fool many people."
Matthew,24,6,You will hear about wars. You will also hear people talking about future wars. Don’t be alarmed. Those things must happen. But the end still isn’t here.
Matthew,24,7,Nation will fight against nation. Kingdom will fight against kingdom. People will go hungry. There will be earthquakes in many places.
Matthew,24,8,All these are the beginning of birth pains.
Matthew,24,9,“Then people will hand you over to be treated badly and killed. All nations will hate you because of me.
Matthew,24,10,"At that time, many will turn away from their faith. They will hate each other. They will hand each other over to their enemies."
Matthew,24,11,Many false prophets will appear. They will fool many people.
Matthew,24,12,"Because evil will grow, most people’s love will grow cold."
Matthew,24,13,But the one who remains strong in the faith will be saved.
Matthew,24,14,This good news of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world. It will be a witness to all nations. Then the end will come.
Matthew,24,15,“The prophet Daniel spoke about ‘the hated thing that destroys.’( Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11) Someday you will see it standing in the holy place. The reader should understand this.
Matthew,24,16,Then those who are in Judea should escape to the mountains.
Matthew,24,17,No one on the housetop should go down into the house to take anything out.
Matthew,24,18,No one in the field should go back to get their coat.
Matthew,24,19,How awful it will be in those days for pregnant women! How awful for nursing mothers!
Matthew,24,20,Pray that you will not have to escape in winter or on the Sabbath day.
Matthew,24,21,There will be terrible suffering in those days. It will be worse than any other from the beginning of the world until now. And there will never be anything like it again.
Matthew,24,22,"“If the time had not been cut short, no one would live. But because of God’s chosen people, it will be shortened."
Matthew,24,23,"At that time someone may say to you, ‘Look! Here is the Messiah!’ Or, ‘There he is!’ Do not believe it."
Matthew,24,24,False messiahs and false prophets will appear. They will do great signs and miracles. They will try to fool God’s chosen people if possible.
Matthew,24,25,"See, I have told you ahead of time."
Matthew,24,26,"“So if anyone tells you, ‘He is a long way out in the desert,’ do not go out there. Or if anyone says, ‘He is deep inside the house,’ do not believe it."
Matthew,24,27,Lightning that comes from the east can be seen in the west. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
Matthew,24,28,The vultures will gather wherever there is a dead body.
Matthew,24,29,"“Right after the terrible suffering of those days, “ ‘The sun will be darkened. The moon will not shine. The stars will fall from the sky. The heavenly bodies will be shaken.’( Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)"
Matthew,24,30,"“Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven. At that time, all the peoples of the earth will mourn. They will mourn when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven. He will come with power and great glory."
Matthew,24,31,He will send his angels with a loud trumpet call. They will gather his chosen people from all four directions. They will bring them from one end of the heavens to the other.
Matthew,24,32,"“Learn a lesson from the fig tree. As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near."
Matthew,24,33,"In the same way, when you see all these things happening, you know that the end is near. It is right at the door."
Matthew,24,34,What I’m about to tell you is true. The people living now will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.
Matthew,24,35,Heaven and earth will pass away. But my words will never pass away.
Matthew,24,36,“But no one knows about that day or hour. Not even the angels in heaven know. The Son does not know. Only the Father knows.
Matthew,24,37,Remember how it was in the days of Noah. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
Matthew,24,38,"In the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking. They were getting married. They were giving their daughters to be married. They did all those things right up to the day Noah entered the ark."
Matthew,24,39,They knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be when the Son of Man comes.
Matthew,24,40,Two men will be in the field. One will be taken and the other left.
Matthew,24,41,Two women will be grinding with a hand mill. One will be taken and the other left.
Matthew,24,42,“So keep watch. You do not know on what day your Lord will come.
Matthew,24,43,You must understand something. Suppose the owner of the house knew what time of night the robber was coming. Then he would have kept watch. He would not have let his house be broken into.
Matthew,24,44,So you also must be ready. The Son of Man will come at an hour when you don’t expect him.
Matthew,24,45,“Suppose a master puts one of his slaves in charge of the other slaves in his house. The slave’s job is to give them their food at the right time. The master wants a faithful and wise slave for this.
Matthew,24,46,It will be good for the slave if the master finds him doing his job when the master returns.
Matthew,24,47,What I’m about to tell you is true. The master will put that slave in charge of everything he owns.
Matthew,24,48,"But suppose that slave is evil. Suppose he says to himself, ‘My master is staying away a long time.’"
Matthew,24,49,Suppose he begins to beat the other slaves. And suppose he eats and drinks with those who drink too much.
Matthew,24,50,The master of that slave will come back on a day the slave doesn’t expect him. He will return at an hour the slave does not know.
Matthew,24,51,Then the master will cut him to pieces. He will send him to the place where pretenders go. There people will weep and grind their teeth.
Matthew,25,1,“Here is what the kingdom of heaven will be like at that time. Ten bridesmaids took their lamps and went out to meet the groom.
Matthew,25,2,Five of them were foolish. Five were wise.
Matthew,25,3,The foolish ones took their lamps but didn’t take any olive oil with them.
Matthew,25,4,The wise ones took oil in jars along with their lamps.
Matthew,25,5,The groom did not come for a long time. So the bridesmaids all grew tired and fell asleep.
Matthew,25,6,"“At midnight someone cried out, ‘Here’s the groom! Come out to meet him!’"
Matthew,25,7,“Then all the bridesmaids woke up and got their lamps ready.
Matthew,25,8,"The foolish ones said to the wise ones, ‘Give us some of your oil. Our lamps are going out.’"
Matthew,25,9,"“ ‘No,’ they replied. ‘There may not be enough for all of us. Instead, go to those who sell oil. Buy some for yourselves.’"
Matthew,25,10,"“So they went to buy the oil. But while they were on their way, the groom arrived. The bridesmaids who were ready went in with him to the wedding dinner. Then the door was shut."
Matthew,25,11,"“Later, the other bridesmaids also came. ‘Sir! Sir!’ they said. ‘Open the door for us!’"
Matthew,25,12,"“But he replied, ‘What I’m about to tell you is true. I don’t know you.’"
Matthew,25,13,“So keep watch. You do not know the day or the hour that the groom will come.
Matthew,25,14,"“Again, here is what the kingdom of heaven will be like. A man was going on a journey. He sent for his slaves and put them in charge of his money."
Matthew,25,15,He gave five bags of gold to one. He gave two bags to another. And he gave one bag to the third. The man gave each slave the amount of money he knew the slave could take care of. Then he went on his journey.
Matthew,25,16,The slave who had received five bags of gold went at once and put his money to work. He earned five bags more.
Matthew,25,17,The one with the two bags of gold earned two more.
Matthew,25,18,But the man who had received one bag went and dug a hole in the ground. He hid his master’s money in it.
Matthew,25,19,“After a long time the master of those slaves returned. He wanted to collect all the money they had earned.
Matthew,25,20,"The man who had received five bags of gold brought the other five. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘you trusted me with five bags of gold. See, I have earned five more.’"
Matthew,25,21,"“His master replied, ‘You have done well, good and faithful slave! You have been faithful with a few things. I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master’s happiness!’"
Matthew,25,22,"“The man with two bags of gold also came. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘you trusted me with two bags of gold. See, I have earned two more.’"
Matthew,25,23,"“His master replied, ‘You have done well, good and faithful slave! You have been faithful with a few things. I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master’s happiness!’"
Matthew,25,24,"“Then the man who had received one bag of gold came. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘I knew that you are a hard man. You harvest where you have not planted. You gather crops where you have not scattered seed."
Matthew,25,25,"So I was afraid. I went out and hid your gold in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you.’"
Matthew,25,26,"“His master replied, ‘You evil, lazy slave! So you knew that I harvest where I have not planted? You knew that I gather crops where I have not scattered seed?"
Matthew,25,27,"Well then, you should have put my money in the bank. When I returned, I would have received it back with interest.’"
Matthew,25,28,"“Then his master commanded the other slaves, ‘Take the bag of gold from him. Give it to the one who has ten bags."
Matthew,25,29,Everyone who has will be given more. They will have more than enough. And what about anyone who doesn’t have? Even what they have will be taken away from them.
Matthew,25,30,"Throw that worthless slave outside. There in the darkness, people will weep and grind their teeth.’"
Matthew,25,31,“The Son of Man will come in all his glory. All the angels will come with him. Then he will sit in glory on his throne.
Matthew,25,32,All the nations will be gathered in front of him. He will separate the people into two groups. He will be like a shepherd who separates the sheep from the goats.
Matthew,25,33,He will put the sheep to his right and the goats to his left.
Matthew,25,34,"“Then the King will speak to those on his right. He will say, ‘My Father has blessed you. Come and take what is yours. It is the kingdom prepared for you since the world was created."
Matthew,25,35,I was hungry. And you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty. And you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger. And you invited me in.
Matthew,25,36,I needed clothes. And you gave them to me. I was sick. And you took care of me. I was in prison. And you came to visit me.’
Matthew,25,37,"“Then the people who have done what is right will answer him. ‘Lord,’ they will ask, ‘when did we see you hungry and feed you? When did we see you thirsty and give you something to drink?"
Matthew,25,38,When did we see you as a stranger and invite you in? When did we see you needing clothes and give them to you?
Matthew,25,39,When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?’
Matthew,25,40,"“The King will reply, ‘What I’m about to tell you is true. Anything you did for one of the least important of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’"
Matthew,25,41,"“Then he will say to those on his left, ‘You are cursed! Go away from me into the fire that burns forever. It has been prepared for the devil and his angels."
Matthew,25,42,I was hungry. But you gave me nothing to eat. I was thirsty. But you gave me nothing to drink.
Matthew,25,43,I was a stranger. But you did not invite me in. I needed clothes. But you did not give me any. I was sick and in prison. But you did not take care of me.’
Matthew,25,44,"“They also will answer, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty and not help you? When did we see you as a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison and not help you?’"
Matthew,25,45,"“He will reply, ‘What I’m about to tell you is true. Anything you didn’t do for one of the least important of these, you didn’t do for me.’"
Matthew,25,46,“Then they will go away to be punished forever. But those who have done what is right will receive eternal life.”
Matthew,26,1,"Jesus finished saying all these things. Then he said to his disciples,"
Matthew,26,2,"“As you know, the Passover Feast is two days away. The Son of Man will be handed over to be nailed to a cross.”"
Matthew,26,3,"Then the chief priests met with the elders of the people. They met in the palace of Caiaphas, the high priest."
Matthew,26,4,They made plans to arrest Jesus secretly. They wanted to kill him.
Matthew,26,5,"“But not during the feast,” they said. “The people may stir up trouble.”"
Matthew,26,6,"Jesus was in Bethany. He was in the home of Simon, who had a skin disease."
Matthew,26,7,A woman came to Jesus with a special sealed jar of very expensive perfume. She poured the perfume on his head while he was at the table.
Matthew,26,8,"When the disciples saw this, they became angry. “Why this waste?” they asked."
Matthew,26,9,“The perfume could have been sold at a high price. The money could have been given to poor people.”
Matthew,26,10,"Jesus was aware of this. So he said to them, “Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing to me."
Matthew,26,11,You will always have poor people with you. But you will not always have me.
Matthew,26,12,She poured the perfume on my body to prepare me to be buried.
Matthew,26,13,What I’m about to tell you is true. What she has done will be told anywhere this good news is preached all over the world. It will be told in memory of her.”
Matthew,26,14,One of the 12 disciples went to the chief priests. His name was Judas Iscariot.
Matthew,26,15,"He asked, “What will you give me if I hand Jesus over to you?” So they counted out 30 silver coins for him."
Matthew,26,16,"From then on, Judas watched for the right time to hand Jesus over to them."
Matthew,26,17,"It was the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus. They asked, “Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover meal?”"
Matthew,26,18,"He replied, “Go into the city to a certain man. Tell him, ‘The Teacher says, “My time is near. I am going to celebrate the Passover at your house with my disciples.” ’ ”"
Matthew,26,19,So the disciples did what Jesus had told them to do. They prepared the Passover meal.
Matthew,26,20,"When evening came, Jesus was at the table with his 12 disciples."
Matthew,26,21,"While they were eating, he said, “What I’m about to tell you is true. One of you will hand me over to my enemies.”"
Matthew,26,22,"The disciples became very sad. One after the other, they began to say to him, “Surely you don’t mean me, Lord, do you?”"
Matthew,26,23,"Jesus replied, “The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will hand me over."
Matthew,26,24,The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But how terrible it will be for the one who hands over the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.”
Matthew,26,25,"Judas was the one who was going to hand him over. He said, “Surely you don’t mean me, Teacher, do you?” Jesus answered, “You have said so.”"
Matthew,26,26,"While they were eating, Jesus took bread. He gave thanks and broke it. He handed it to his disciples and said, “Take this and eat it. This is my body.”"
Matthew,26,27,"Then he took a cup. He gave thanks and handed it to them. He said, “All of you drink from it."
Matthew,26,28,This is my blood of the covenant. It is poured out to forgive the sins of many people.
Matthew,26,29,"Here is what I tell you. From now on, I won’t drink wine with you again until the day I drink it with you in my Father’s kingdom.”"
Matthew,26,30,Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives.
Matthew,26,31,"Jesus told them, “This very night you will all turn away because of me. It is written that the Lord said, “ ‘I will strike the shepherd down. Then the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’( Zechariah 13:7)"
Matthew,26,32,"But after I rise from the dead, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.”"
Matthew,26,33,"Peter replied, “All the others may turn away because of you. But I never will.”"
Matthew,26,34,"“What I’m about to tell you is true,” Jesus answered. “It will happen tonight. Before the rooster crows, you will say three times that you don’t know me.”"
Matthew,26,35,"But Peter said, “I may have to die with you. But I will never say I don’t know you.” And all the other disciples said the same thing."
Matthew,26,36,"Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane. He said to them, “Sit here while I go over there and pray.”"
Matthew,26,37,He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him. He began to be sad and troubled.
Matthew,26,38,"Then he said to them, “My soul is very sad. I feel close to death. Stay here. Keep watch with me.”"
Matthew,26,39,"He went a little farther. Then he fell with his face to the ground. He prayed, “My Father, if it is possible, take this cup of suffering away from me. But let what you want be done, not what I want.”"
Matthew,26,40,Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. “Couldn’t you men keep watch with me for one hour?” he asked Peter.
Matthew,26,41,"“Watch and pray. Then you won’t fall into sin when you are tempted. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak.”"
Matthew,26,42,"Jesus went away a second time. He prayed, “My Father, is it possible for this cup to be taken away? But if I must drink it, may what you want be done.”"
Matthew,26,43,Then he came back. Again he found them sleeping. They couldn’t keep their eyes open.
Matthew,26,44,So he left them and went away once more. For the third time he prayed the same thing.
Matthew,26,45,"Then he returned to the disciples. He said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Look! The hour has come. The Son of Man is about to be handed over to sinners."
Matthew,26,46,Get up! Let us go! Here comes the one who is handing me over to them!”
Matthew,26,47,"While Jesus was still speaking, Judas arrived. He was one of the 12 disciples. A large crowd was with him. They were carrying swords and clubs. The chief priests and the elders of the people had sent them."
Matthew,26,48,"Judas, who was going to hand Jesus over, had arranged a signal with them. “The one I kiss is the man,” he said. “Arrest him.”"
Matthew,26,49,"So Judas went to Jesus at once. He said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” And he kissed him."
Matthew,26,50,"Jesus replied, “Friend, do what you came to do.” Then the men stepped forward. They grabbed Jesus and arrested him."
Matthew,26,51,"At that moment, one of Jesus’ companions reached for his sword. He pulled it out and struck the slave of the high priest with it. He cut off the slave’s ear."
Matthew,26,52,"“Put your sword back in its place,” Jesus said to him. “All who use the sword will die by the sword."
Matthew,26,53,"Do you think I can’t ask my Father for help? He would send an army of more than 70,000 angels right away."
Matthew,26,54,But then how would the Scriptures come true? They say it must happen in this way.”
Matthew,26,55,At that time Jesus spoke to the crowd. “Am I leading a band of armed men against you?” he asked. “Do you have to come out with swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I sat in the temple courtyard teaching. And you didn’t arrest me.
Matthew,26,56,But all this has happened so that the words of the prophets would come true.” Then all the disciples left him and ran away.
Matthew,26,57,"Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest. The teachers of the law and the elders had come together there."
Matthew,26,58,"Not too far away, Peter followed Jesus. He went right up to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the guards to see what would happen."
Matthew,26,59,The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for something to use against Jesus. They wanted to put him to death.
Matthew,26,60,"But they did not find any proof, even though many false witnesses came forward. Finally, two other witnesses came forward."
Matthew,26,61,"They said, “This fellow claimed, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God. I can build it again in three days.’ ”"
Matthew,26,62,"Then the high priest stood up. He asked Jesus, “Aren’t you going to answer? What are these charges that these men are bringing against you?”"
Matthew,26,63,"But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, “I am commanding you in the name of the living God. May he judge you if you don’t tell the truth. Tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God.”"
Matthew,26,64,"“You have said so,” Jesus replied. “But here is what I say to all of you. From now on, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One. You will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven.”"
Matthew,26,65,"Then the high priest tore his clothes. He said, “He has spoken a very evil thing against God! Why do we need any more witnesses? You have heard him say this evil thing."
Matthew,26,66,What do you think?” “He must die!” they answered.
Matthew,26,67,Then they spit in his face. They hit him with their fists. Others slapped him.
Matthew,26,68,"They said, “Prophesy to us, Messiah! Who hit you?”"
Matthew,26,69,"Peter was sitting out in the courtyard. A female servant came to him. “You also were with Jesus of Galilee,” she said."
Matthew,26,70,"But in front of all of them, Peter said he was not. “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he said."
Matthew,26,71,"Then he went out to the gate leading into the courtyard. There another servant saw him. She said to the people, “This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth.”"
Matthew,26,72,"Again he said he was not. With a curse he said, “I don’t know the man!”"
Matthew,26,73,"After a little while, those standing there went up to Peter. “You must be one of them,” they said. “The way you talk gives you away.”"
Matthew,26,74,"Then Peter began to curse and said to them, “I don’t know the man!” Right away a rooster crowed."
Matthew,26,75,"Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said. “The rooster will crow,” Jesus had told him. “Before it does, you will say three times that you don’t know me.” Peter went outside. He broke down and cried."
Matthew,27,1,It was early in the morning. All the chief priests and the elders of the people planned how to put Jesus to death.
Matthew,27,2,"So they tied him up and led him away. Then they handed him over to Pilate, who was the governor."
Matthew,27,3,"Judas, who had handed him over, saw that Jesus had been sentenced to die. He felt deep shame and sadness for what he had done. So he returned the 30 silver coins to the chief priests and the elders."
Matthew,27,4,"“I have sinned,” he said. “I handed over a man who is not guilty.” “What do we care?” they replied. “That’s your problem.”"
Matthew,27,5,So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.
Matthew,27,6,"The chief priests picked up the coins. They said, “It’s against the law to put this money into the temple fund. It is blood money. It has paid for a man’s death.”"
Matthew,27,7,So they decided to use the money to buy a potter’s field. People from other countries would be buried there.
Matthew,27,8,That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day.
Matthew,27,9,"Then the words spoken by Jeremiah the prophet came true. He had said, “They took the 30 silver coins. That price was set for him by the people of Israel."
Matthew,27,10,"They used the coins to buy a potter’s field, just as the Lord commanded me.”( Zechariah 11:12, 13; Jeremiah 19:1–13; 32:6–9)"
Matthew,27,11,"Jesus was standing in front of the governor. The governor asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?” “Yes. You have said so,” Jesus replied."
Matthew,27,12,"But when the chief priests and the elders brought charges against him, he did not answer."
Matthew,27,13,"Then Pilate asked him, “Don’t you hear the charges they are bringing against you?”"
Matthew,27,14,"But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge. The governor was really amazed."
Matthew,27,15,It was the governor’s practice at the Passover Feast to let one prisoner go free. The people could choose the one they wanted.
Matthew,27,16,At that time they had a well-known prisoner named Jesus Barabbas.
Matthew,27,17,"So when the crowd gathered, Pilate asked them, “Which one do you want me to set free? Jesus Barabbas? Or Jesus who is called the Messiah?”"
Matthew,27,18,Pilate knew that the leaders wanted to get their own way. He knew this was why they had handed Jesus over to him.
Matthew,27,19,"While Pilate was sitting on the judge’s seat, his wife sent him a message. It said, “Don’t have anything to do with that man. He is not guilty. I have suffered a great deal in a dream today because of him.”"
Matthew,27,20,But the chief priests and the elders talked the crowd into asking for Barabbas and having Jesus put to death.
Matthew,27,21,"“Which of the two do you want me to set free?” asked the governor. “Barabbas,” they answered."
Matthew,27,22,"“Then what should I do with Jesus who is called the Messiah?” Pilate asked. They all answered, “Crucify him!”"
Matthew,27,23,"“Why? What wrong has he done?” asked Pilate. But they shouted even louder, “Crucify him!”"
Matthew,27,24,"Pilate saw that he wasn’t getting anywhere. Instead, the crowd was starting to get angry. So he took water and washed his hands in front of them. “I am not guilty of this man’s death,” he said. “You are accountable for that!”"
Matthew,27,25,"All the people answered, “Put the blame for his death on us and our children!”"
Matthew,27,26,Pilate let Barabbas go free. But he had Jesus whipped. Then he handed him over to be nailed to a cross.
Matthew,27,27,"The governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the palace, which was called the Praetorium. All the rest of the soldiers gathered around him."
Matthew,27,28,They took off his clothes and put a purple robe on him.
Matthew,27,29,"Then they twisted thorns together to make a crown. They placed it on his head. They put a stick in his right hand. Then they fell on their knees in front of him and made fun of him. “We honor you, king of the Jews!” they said."
Matthew,27,30,They spit on him. They hit him on the head with the stick again and again.
Matthew,27,31,"After they had made fun of him, they took off the robe. They put his own clothes back on him. Then they led him away to nail him to a cross."
Matthew,27,32,"On their way out of the city, they met a man from Cyrene. His name was Simon. They forced him to carry the cross."
Matthew,27,33,They came to a place called Golgotha. The word Golgotha means the Place of the Skull.
Matthew,27,34,"There they mixed wine with bitter spices and gave it to Jesus to drink. After tasting it, he refused to drink it."
Matthew,27,35,"When they had nailed him to the cross, they divided up his clothes by casting lots."
Matthew,27,36,They sat down and kept watch over him there.
Matthew,27,37,"Above his head they placed the written charge against him. It read, This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
Matthew,27,38,Two rebels against Rome were crucified with him. One was on his right and one was on his left.
Matthew,27,39,Those who passed by shouted at Jesus and made fun of him. They shook their heads
Matthew,27,40,"and said, “So you are going to destroy the temple and build it again in three days? Then save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!”"
Matthew,27,41,"In the same way the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders made fun of him."
Matthew,27,42,"“He saved others,” they said. “But he can’t save himself! He’s the king of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross! Then we will believe in him."
Matthew,27,43,"He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he wants him. He’s the one who said, ‘I am the Son of God.’ ”"
Matthew,27,44,In the same way the rebels who were being crucified with Jesus also made fun of him.
Matthew,27,45,"From noon until three o’clock, the whole land was covered with darkness."
Matthew,27,46,"About three o’clock, Jesus cried out in a loud voice. He said, “ Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani? ” This means “My God, my God, why have you deserted me?”( Psalm 22:1)"
Matthew,27,47,"Some of those standing there heard Jesus cry out. They said, “He’s calling for Elijah.”"
Matthew,27,48,Right away one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar and put it on a stick. He offered it to Jesus to drink.
Matthew,27,49,"The rest said, “Leave him alone. Let’s see if Elijah comes to save him.”"
Matthew,27,50,"After Jesus cried out again in a loud voice, he died."
Matthew,27,51,At that moment the temple curtain was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook. The rocks split.
Matthew,27,52,Tombs broke open. The bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life.
Matthew,27,53,"They came out of the tombs. After Jesus was raised from the dead, they went into the holy city. There they appeared to many people."
Matthew,27,54,"The Roman commander and those guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened. They were terrified. They exclaimed, “He was surely the Son of God!”"
Matthew,27,55,"Not very far away, many women were watching. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to take care of his needs."
Matthew,27,56,"Mary Magdalene was among them. Mary, the mother of James and Joseph, was also there. So was the mother of Zebedee’s sons."
Matthew,27,57,"As evening approached, a rich man came from the town of Arimathea. His name was Joseph. He had become a follower of Jesus."
Matthew,27,58,He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus’ body. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Matthew,27,59,Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.
Matthew,27,60,He placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb. Then he went away.
Matthew,27,61,Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there across from the tomb.
Matthew,27,62,The next day was the day after Preparation Day. The chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
Matthew,27,63,"“Sir,” they said, “we remember something that liar said while he was still alive. He claimed, ‘After three days I will rise again.’"
Matthew,27,64,"So give the order to make the tomb secure until the third day. If you don’t, his disciples might come and steal the body. Then they will tell the people that Jesus has been raised from the dead. This last lie will be worse than the first.”"
Matthew,27,65,"“Take some guards with you,” Pilate answered. “Go. Make the tomb as secure as you can.”"
Matthew,27,66,So they went and made the tomb secure. They put a royal seal on the stone and placed some guards on duty.
Matthew,28,1,The Sabbath day was now over. It was dawn on the first day of the week. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.
Matthew,28,2,There was a powerful earthquake. An angel of the Lord came down from heaven. The angel went to the tomb. He rolled back the stone and sat on it.
Matthew,28,3,His body shone like lightning. His clothes were as white as snow.
Matthew,28,4,The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.
Matthew,28,5,"The angel said to the women, “Don’t be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified."
Matthew,28,6,"He is not here! He has risen, just as he said he would! Come and see the place where he was lying."
Matthew,28,7,"Go quickly! Tell his disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead. He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.’ Now I have told you.”"
Matthew,28,8,"So the women hurried away from the tomb. They were afraid, but they were filled with joy. They ran to tell the disciples."
Matthew,28,9,"Suddenly Jesus met them. “Greetings!” he said. They came to him, took hold of his feet and worshiped him."
Matthew,28,10,"Then Jesus said to them, “Don’t be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see me.”"
Matthew,28,11,"While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city. They reported to the chief priests all that had happened."
Matthew,28,12,"When the chief priests met with the elders, they came up with a plan. They gave the soldiers a large amount of money."
Matthew,28,13,"They told the soldiers, “We want you to say, ‘His disciples came during the night. They stole his body while we were sleeping.’"
Matthew,28,14,"If the governor hears this report, we will pay him off. That will keep you out of trouble.”"
Matthew,28,15,So the soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story has spread all around among the Jews to this day.
Matthew,28,16,Then the 11 disciples went to Galilee. They went to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
Matthew,28,17,"When they saw him, they worshiped him. But some still had their doubts."
Matthew,28,18,"Then Jesus came to them. He said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
Matthew,28,19,So you must go and make disciples of all nations. Baptize them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
Matthew,28,20,"Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And you can be sure that I am always with you, to the very end.”"
