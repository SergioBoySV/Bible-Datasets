2 Timothy,1,1,"I, Paul, am writing this letter. I am an apostle of Christ Jesus just as God planned. He sent me to tell about the promise of life found in Christ Jesus."
2 Timothy,1,2,"Timothy, I am sending you this letter. You are my dear son. May God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord give you grace, mercy and peace."
2 Timothy,1,3,"I thank God, whom I serve as did our people of long ago. I serve God, knowing that what I have done is right. Night and day I thank God for you. Night and day I always remember you in my prayers."
2 Timothy,1,4,I remember your tears. I long to see you so that I can be filled with joy.
2 Timothy,1,5,I remember your honest and true faith. It was alive first in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice. And I am certain that it is now alive in you also.
2 Timothy,1,6,"This is why I remind you to help God’s gift grow, just as a small spark grows into a fire. God put his gift in you when I placed my hands on you."
2 Timothy,1,7,"God gave us his Spirit. And the Spirit doesn’t make us weak and fearful. Instead, the Spirit gives us power and love. He helps us control ourselves."
2 Timothy,1,8,"So don’t be ashamed of the message about our Lord. And don’t be ashamed of me, his prisoner. Instead, join with me as I suffer for the good news. God’s power will help us do that."
2 Timothy,1,9,"God has saved us. He has chosen us to live a holy life. It wasn’t because of anything we have done. It was because of his own purpose and grace. Through Christ Jesus, God gave us this grace even before time began."
2 Timothy,1,10,"It has now been made known through the coming of our Savior, Christ Jesus. He has broken the power of death. Because of the good news, he has brought life out into the light. That life never dies."
2 Timothy,1,11,I was appointed to announce the good news. I was appointed to be an apostle and a teacher.
2 Timothy,1,12,That’s why I’m suffering the way I am. But this gives me no reason to be ashamed. That’s because I know who I have believed in. I am sure he is able to take care of what I have given him. I can trust him with it until the day he returns as judge.
2 Timothy,1,13,Follow what you heard from me as the pattern of true teaching. Follow it with faith and love because you belong to Christ Jesus.
2 Timothy,1,14,Guard the truth of the good news that you were trusted with. Guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us.
2 Timothy,1,15,You know that all the believers in Asia Minor have deserted me. They include Phygelus and Hermogenes.
2 Timothy,1,16,May the Lord show mercy to all who live in the house of Onesiphorus. He often encouraged me. He was not ashamed that I was being held by chains.
2 Timothy,1,17,"In fact, it was just the opposite. When he was in Rome, he looked everywhere for me. At last he found me."
2 Timothy,1,18,May Onesiphorus find mercy from the Lord on the day Jesus returns as judge! You know very well how many ways Onesiphorus helped me in Ephesus.
2 Timothy,2,1,"My son, be strong in the grace that is yours in Christ Jesus."
2 Timothy,2,2,You have heard me teach in front of many witnesses. Pass on to people you can trust the things you’ve heard me say. Then they will be able to teach others also.
2 Timothy,2,3,"Like a good soldier of Christ Jesus, join with me in suffering."
2 Timothy,2,4,"A soldier does not take part in things that don’t have anything to do with the army. Instead, he tries to please his commanding officer."
2 Timothy,2,5,It is the same for anyone who takes part in a sport. They don’t receive the winner’s crown unless they play by the rules.
2 Timothy,2,6,The farmer who works hard should be the first to receive a share of the crops.
2 Timothy,2,7,Think about what I’m saying. The Lord will help you understand what all of it means.
2 Timothy,2,8,Remember Jesus Christ. He came from David’s family line. He was raised from the dead. That is my good news.
2 Timothy,2,9,I am suffering for it. I have even been put in chains like someone who has committed a crime. But God’s word is not held back by chains.
2 Timothy,2,10,So I put up with everything for the good of God’s chosen people. Then they also can be saved. Christ Jesus saves them. He gives them glory that will last forever.
2 Timothy,2,11,"Here is a saying you can trust. If we died with him, we will also live with him."
2 Timothy,2,12,"If we don’t give up, we will also rule with him. If we say we don’t know him, he will also say he doesn’t know us."
2 Timothy,2,13,"Even if we are not faithful, he remains faithful. He must be true to himself."
2 Timothy,2,14,"Keep reminding God’s people of these things. While God is watching, warn them not to argue about words. That doesn’t have any value. It only destroys those who listen."
2 Timothy,2,15,Do your best to please God. Be a worker who doesn’t need to be ashamed. Teach the message of truth correctly.
2 Timothy,2,16,Stay away from godless chatter. Those who take part in it will become more and more ungodly.
2 Timothy,2,17,Their teaching will spread like a deadly sickness. Hymenaeus and Philetus are two of those teachers.
2 Timothy,2,18,They have turned away from the truth. They say that the time when people will rise from the dead has already come. They destroy the faith of some people.
2 Timothy,2,19,"But God’s solid foundation stands firm. Here is the message written on it. “The Lord knows who his own people are.”( Numbers 16:5) Also, “All who say they believe in the Lord must turn away from evil.”"
2 Timothy,2,20,In a large house there are things made out of gold and silver. But there are also things made out of wood and clay. Some have special purposes. Others have common purposes.
2 Timothy,2,21,Suppose someone stays away from what is common. Then the Master will be able to use them for special purposes. They will be made holy. They will be ready to do any good work.
2 Timothy,2,22,"Run away from the evil things that young people long for. Try hard to do what is right. Have faith, love and peace. Do these things together with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart."
2 Timothy,2,23,Don’t have anything to do with arguing. It is dumb and foolish. You know it only leads to fights.
2 Timothy,2,24,"Anyone who serves the Lord must not be hard to get along with. Instead, they must be kind to everyone. They must be able to teach. The one who serves must not hold anything against anyone."
2 Timothy,2,25,They must gently teach those who are against them. Maybe God will give a change of heart to those who are against you. That will lead them to know the truth.
2 Timothy,2,26,Maybe they will come to their senses. Maybe they will escape the devil’s trap. He has taken them as prisoners to do what he wanted.
2 Timothy,3,1,Here is what I want you to know. There will be terrible times in the last days.
2 Timothy,3,2,People will love themselves. They will love money. They will brag and be proud. They will tear others down. They will not obey their parents. They won’t be thankful or holy.
2 Timothy,3,3,They won’t love others. They won’t forgive others. They will tell lies about people. They will be out of control. They will be wild. They will hate what is good.
2 Timothy,3,4,They will turn against their friends. They will act without thinking. They will think they are better than others. They will love what pleases them instead of loving God.
2 Timothy,3,5,They will act as if they were serving God. But what they do will show that they have turned their backs on God’s power. Have nothing to do with these people.
2 Timothy,3,6,They are the kind who trick their way into the homes of some women. These women are ready to believe anything. And they take control over these women. These women are loaded down with sins. They give in to all kinds of evil desires.
2 Timothy,3,7,They are always learning. But they are never able to come to know the truth.
2 Timothy,3,8,"Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses. In the same way, the teachers I’m talking about oppose the truth. Their minds are twisted. As far as the faith is concerned, God doesn’t accept them."
2 Timothy,3,9,"They won’t get very far. Just like Jannes and Jambres, their foolish ways will be clear to everyone."
2 Timothy,3,10,But you know all about my teaching. You know how I live and what I live for. You know about my faith and love. You know how patient I am. You know I haven’t given up.
2 Timothy,3,11,"You know that I was treated badly. You know that I suffered greatly. You know what kinds of things happened to me in Antioch, Iconium and Lystra. You know how badly I have been treated. But the Lord saved me from all my troubles."
2 Timothy,3,12,"In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be treated badly."
2 Timothy,3,13,"Evil people and pretenders will go from bad to worse. They will fool others, and others will fool them."
2 Timothy,3,14,But I want you to continue to follow what you have learned and are sure about. You know the people you learned it from.
2 Timothy,3,15,You have known the Holy Scriptures ever since you were a little child. They are able to teach you how to be saved by believing in Christ Jesus.
2 Timothy,3,16,God has breathed life into all Scripture. It is useful for teaching us what is true. It is useful for correcting our mistakes. It is useful for making our lives whole again. It is useful for training us to do what is right.
2 Timothy,3,17,"By using Scripture, the servant of God can be completely prepared to do every good thing."
2 Timothy,4,1,"I give you a command in the sight of God and Christ Jesus. Christ will judge the living and the dead. Because he and his kingdom are coming, here is the command I give you."
2 Timothy,4,2,Preach the word. Be ready to serve God in good times and bad. Correct people’s mistakes. Warn them. Encourage them with words of hope. Be very patient as you do these things. Teach them carefully.
2 Timothy,4,3,"The time will come when people won’t put up with true teaching. Instead, they will try to satisfy their own desires. They will gather a large number of teachers around them. The teachers will say what the people want to hear."
2 Timothy,4,4,The people will turn their ears away from the truth. They will turn to stories that aren’t true.
2 Timothy,4,5,But I want you to keep your head no matter what happens. Don’t give up when times are hard. Work to spread the good news. Do everything God has given you to do.
2 Timothy,4,6,I am already being poured out like a drink offering. The time when I will leave is near.
2 Timothy,4,7,I have fought the good fight. I have finished the race. I have kept the faith.
2 Timothy,4,8,"Now there is a crown waiting for me. It is given to those who are right with God. The Lord, who judges fairly, will give it to me on the day he returns. He will not give it only to me. He will also give it to all those who are longing for him to return."
2 Timothy,4,9,Do your best to come to me quickly.
2 Timothy,4,10,Demas has deserted me. He has gone to Thessalonica. He left me because he loved this world. Crescens has gone to Galatia. Titus has gone to Dalmatia.
2 Timothy,4,11,Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you. He helps me in my work for the Lord.
2 Timothy,4,12,I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.
2 Timothy,4,13,"When you come, bring my coat. I left it with Carpus at Troas. Also bring my books. Most of all, bring the ones made out of animal skins."
2 Timothy,4,14,"Remember Alexander, the one who works with metal. He did me a great deal of harm. The Lord will pay him back for what he has done."
2 Timothy,4,15,You too should watch out for him. He strongly opposed our message.
2 Timothy,4,16,"The first time I was put on trial, no one came to help me. Everyone deserted me. I hope they will be forgiven for it."
2 Timothy,4,17,The Lord stood at my side. He gave me the strength to preach the whole message. Then all the Gentiles heard it. I was saved from the lion’s mouth.
2 Timothy,4,18,The Lord will save me from every evil attack. He will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom. Give him glory for ever and ever. Amen.
2 Timothy,4,19,Greet Priscilla and Aquila. Greet those who live in the house of Onesiphorus.
2 Timothy,4,20,Erastus stayed in Corinth. I left Trophimus sick in Miletus.
2 Timothy,4,21,"Do your best to get here before winter. Eubulus greets you. So do Pudens, Linus, Claudia and all the brothers and sisters."
2 Timothy,4,22,May the Lord be with your spirit. May God’s grace be with you all.
