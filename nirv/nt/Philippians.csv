Philippians,1,1,"We, Paul and Timothy, are writing this letter. We serve Christ Jesus. We are sending this letter to you, all God’s holy people in Philippi. You belong to Christ Jesus. We are also sending this letter to your leaders and deacons."
Philippians,1,2,May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace.
Philippians,1,3,I thank my God every time I remember you.
Philippians,1,4,"In all my prayers for all of you, I always pray with joy."
Philippians,1,5,I am happy because you have joined me in spreading the good news. You have done so from the first day until now.
Philippians,1,6,God began a good work in you. And I am sure that he will carry it on until it is completed. That will be on the day Christ Jesus returns.
Philippians,1,7,"It is right for me to feel this way about all of you. I love you with all my heart. I may be held by chains, or I may be standing up for the truth of the good news. Either way, all of you share in God’s grace together with me."
Philippians,1,8,God is my witness that I long for all of you. I love you with the love that Christ Jesus gives.
Philippians,1,9,I pray that your love will grow more and more. And let it be based on knowledge and understanding.
Philippians,1,10,Then you will be able to know what is best. Then you will be pure and without blame for the day that Christ returns.
Philippians,1,11,You will be filled with the fruit of right living produced by Jesus Christ. All these things bring glory and praise to God.
Philippians,1,12,"Brothers and sisters, here is what I want you to know. What has happened to me has actually helped to spread the good news."
Philippians,1,13,One thing has become clear. I am being held by chains because I am a witness for Christ. All the palace guards and everyone else know it.
Philippians,1,14,"And because I am a prisoner, most of the believers have become bolder in the Lord. They now dare even more to preach the good news without fear."
Philippians,1,15,It’s true that some preach about Christ because they are jealous. But others preach about Christ to help me in my work.
Philippians,1,16,The last group acts out of love. They know I have been put here to be a witness for the good news.
Philippians,1,17,But the others preach about Christ only to get ahead. They preach Christ for the wrong reasons. They think they can stir up trouble for me while I am being held by chains.
Philippians,1,18,"But what does it matter? Here is the important thing. Whether for right or wrong reasons, Christ is being preached about. That makes me very glad. And I will continue to be glad."
Philippians,1,19,"I know that you are praying for me. I also know that God will give me the Spirit of Jesus Christ to help me. So no matter what happens, I’m sure I will still be set free."
Philippians,1,20,I completely expect and hope that I won’t be ashamed in any way. I’m sure I will be brave enough. Now as always Christ will receive glory because of what happens to me. He will receive glory whether I live or die.
Philippians,1,21,"For me, life finds all its meaning in Christ. Death also has its benefits."
Philippians,1,22,Suppose I go on living in my body. Then I will be able to carry on my work. It will bear a lot of fruit. But what should I choose? I don’t know!
Philippians,1,23,I can’t decide between the two. I long to leave this world and be with Christ. That is better by far.
Philippians,1,24,But it is more important for you that I stay alive.
Philippians,1,25,I’m sure of this. So I know I will remain with you. And I will continue with all of you to help you grow in your faith. I will also continue to help you be joyful in what you have been taught.
Philippians,1,26,I’m sure I will be with you again. Then you will be able to boast in Christ Jesus even more because of me.
Philippians,1,27,"No matter what happens, live in a way that brings honor to the good news about Christ. Then I will know that you remain strong together in the one Spirit. I will know this if I come and see you or only hear about you. I will know that you work together as one person. I will know that you work to spread the teachings about the good news."
Philippians,1,28,So don’t be afraid in any way of those who oppose you. This will show them that they will be destroyed and that you will be saved. That’s what God will do.
Philippians,1,29,Here is what he has given you to do for Christ. You must not only believe in him. You must also suffer for him.
Philippians,1,30,"You are going through the same struggle you saw me go through. As you have heard, I am still struggling."
Philippians,2,1,So does belonging to Christ help you in any way? Does his love comfort you at all? Do you share anything in common because of the Holy Spirit? Has Christ ever been gentle and loving toward you?
Philippians,2,2,"If any of these things has happened to you, then agree with one another. Have the same love. Be one in spirit and in the way you think and act. By doing this, you will make my joy complete."
Philippians,2,3,"Don’t do anything only to get ahead. Don’t do it because you are proud. Instead, be humble. Value others more than yourselves."
Philippians,2,4,None of you should look out just for your own good. Each of you should also look out for the good of others.
Philippians,2,5,"As you deal with one another, you should think and act as Jesus did."
Philippians,2,6,In his very nature he was God. Jesus was equal with God. But Jesus didn’t take advantage of that fact.
Philippians,2,7,"Instead, he made himself nothing. He did this by taking on the nature of a servant. He was made just like human beings."
Philippians,2,8,"He appeared as a man. He was humble and obeyed God completely. He did this even though it led to his death. Even worse, he died on a cross!"
Philippians,2,9,So God lifted him up to the highest place. God gave him the name that is above every name.
Philippians,2,10,"When the name of Jesus is spoken, everyone will kneel down to worship him. Everyone in heaven and on earth and under the earth will kneel down to worship him."
Philippians,2,11,Everyone’s mouth will say that Jesus Christ is Lord. And God the Father will receive the glory.
Philippians,2,12,"My dear friends, you have always obeyed God. You obeyed while I was with you. And you have obeyed even more while I am not with you. So continue to work out your own salvation. Do it with fear and trembling."
Philippians,2,13,God is working in you. He wants your plans and your acts to fulfill his good purpose.
Philippians,2,14,Do everything without complaining or arguing.
Philippians,2,15,Then you will be pure and without blame. You will be children of God without fault among sinful and evil people. Then you will shine among them like stars in the sky.
Philippians,2,16,You will shine as you hold on tight to the word of life. Then I will be able to boast about you on the day Christ returns. I can be happy that I didn’t run or work for nothing.
Philippians,2,17,"But my life might even be poured out like a drink offering on your sacrifices. I’m talking about the way you serve because you believe. Even so, I am glad. I am joyful with all of you."
Philippians,2,18,So you too should be glad and joyful with me.
Philippians,2,19,I hope to send Timothy to you soon if the Lord Jesus allows it. Then I will be encouraged when I receive news about you.
Philippians,2,20,I have no one else like Timothy. He will truly care about how you are doing.
Philippians,2,21,All the others are looking out for their own interests. They are not looking out for the interests of Jesus Christ.
Philippians,2,22,But you know that Timothy has proved himself. He has served with me like a son with his father in spreading the good news.
Philippians,2,23,So I hope to send him as soon as I see how things go with me.
Philippians,2,24,And I’m sure I myself will come soon if the Lord allows it.
Philippians,2,25,But I think it’s necessary to send Epaphroditus back to you. He is my brother in the Lord. He is a worker and a soldier of Christ together with me. He is also your messenger. You sent him to take care of my needs.
Philippians,2,26,He longs for all of you. He is troubled because you heard he was sick.
Philippians,2,27,"He was very sick. In fact, he almost died. But God had mercy on him. He also had mercy on me. God spared me sadness after sadness."
Philippians,2,28,"So I want even more to send him to you. Then when you see him again, you will be glad. And I won’t worry so much."
Philippians,2,29,"So then, welcome him as a brother in the Lord with great joy. Honor people like him."
Philippians,2,30,He almost died for the work of Christ. He put his life in danger to make up for the help you yourselves couldn’t give me.
Philippians,3,1,"Further, my brothers and sisters, be joyful because you belong to the Lord! It is no trouble for me to write about some important matters to you again. If you know about them, you will have a safe path to follow."
Philippians,3,2,"Watch out for those dogs. They are people who do evil things. When they circumcise, it is nothing more than a useless cutting of the body."
Philippians,3,3,But we have been truly circumcised. We serve God by the power of his Spirit. We boast about what Christ Jesus has done. We don’t put our trust in who we are or what we can do.
Philippians,3,4,I have many reasons to trust in who I am and what I have done. Someone else may think they have reasons to trust in these things. But I have even more.
Philippians,3,5,"I was circumcised on the eighth day. I am part of the people of Israel. I am from the tribe of Benjamin. I am a pure Hebrew. As far as the law is concerned, I am a Pharisee."
Philippians,3,6,"As far as being committed is concerned, I opposed and attacked the church. As far as keeping the law is concerned, I kept it perfectly."
Philippians,3,7,I thought things like that were really something great. But now I consider them to be nothing because of Christ.
Philippians,3,8,"Even more, I consider everything to be nothing compared to knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. To know him is worth much more than anything else. Because of him I have lost everything. But I consider all of it to be garbage so I can know Christ better."
Philippians,3,9,I want to be joined to him. Being right with God does not come from my obeying the law. It comes because I believe in Christ. It comes from God because of faith.
Philippians,3,10,"I want to know Christ better. Yes, I want to know the power that raised him from the dead. I want to join him in his sufferings. I want to become like him by sharing in his death."
Philippians,3,11,Then by God’s grace I will rise from the dead.
Philippians,3,12,I have not yet received all these things. I have not yet reached my goal. Christ Jesus took hold of me so that I could reach that goal. So I keep pushing myself forward to reach it.
Philippians,3,13,"Brothers and sisters, I don’t consider that I have taken hold of it yet. But here is the one thing I do. I forget what is behind me. I push hard toward what is ahead of me."
Philippians,3,14,I push myself forward toward the goal to win the prize. God has appointed me to win it. The heavenly prize is Christ Jesus himself.
Philippians,3,15,So all of us who are grown up in the faith should see things this way. Maybe you think differently about something. But God will make it clear to you.
Philippians,3,16,Only let us live up to what we have already reached.
Philippians,3,17,"Brothers and sisters, join together in following my example. You have us as a model. So pay close attention to those who live as we do."
Philippians,3,18,I have told you these things many times before. Now I tell you again with tears in my eyes. Many people live like enemies of the cross of Christ.
Philippians,3,19,The only thing they have coming to them is death. Their stomach is their god. They brag about what they should be ashamed of. They think only about earthly things.
Philippians,3,20,But we are citizens of heaven. And we can hardly wait for a Savior from there. He is the Lord Jesus Christ.
Philippians,3,21,He has the power to bring everything under his control. By his power he will change our earthly bodies. They will become like his glorious body.
Philippians,4,1,"My brothers and sisters, in this way remain strong in the Lord. I love you and long for you. Dear friends, you are my joy and my crown."
Philippians,4,2,Here is what I’m asking Euodia and Syntyche to do. I’m asking them to work together in the Lord. That’s because they both belong to the Lord.
Philippians,4,3,"My true companion, here is what I ask you to do. Help these women, because they have served at my side. They have worked with me to spread the good news. So have Clement and the rest of those who have worked together with me. Their names are all written in the book of life."
Philippians,4,4,Always be joyful because you belong to the Lord. I will say it again. Be joyful!
Philippians,4,5,Let everyone know how gentle you are. The Lord is coming soon.
Philippians,4,6,"Don’t worry about anything. No matter what happens, tell God about everything. Ask and pray, and give thanks to him."
Philippians,4,7,Then God’s peace will watch over your hearts and your minds. He will do this because you belong to Christ Jesus. God’s peace can never be completely understood.
Philippians,4,8,"Finally, my brothers and sisters, always think about what is true. Think about what is noble, right and pure. Think about what is lovely and worthy of respect. If anything is excellent or worthy of praise, think about those kinds of things."
Philippians,4,9,Do what you have learned or received or heard from me. Follow my example. The God who gives peace will be with you.
Philippians,4,10,At last you are concerned about me again. That makes me very happy. We belong to the Lord. I know that you were concerned. But you had no chance to show it.
Philippians,4,11,I’m not saying this because I need anything. I have learned to be content no matter what happens to me.
Philippians,4,12,I know what it’s like not to have what I need. I also know what it’s like to have more than I need. I have learned the secret of being content no matter what happens. I am content whether I am well fed or hungry. I am content whether I have more than enough or not enough.
Philippians,4,13,I can do all this by the power of Christ. He gives me strength.
Philippians,4,14,But it was good of you to share in my troubles.
Philippians,4,15,And you believers at Philippi know what happened when I left Macedonia. Not one church helped me in the matter of giving and receiving. You were the only one that did. That was in the early days when you first heard the good news.
Philippians,4,16,"Even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent me help when I needed it. And you did it more than once."
Philippians,4,17,It is not that I want your gifts. What I really want is what is best for you.
Philippians,4,18,I have received my full pay and have more than enough. I have everything I need. That’s because Epaphroditus brought me the gifts you sent. They are a sweet-smelling offering. They are a gift that God accepts. He is pleased with it.
Philippians,4,19,My God will meet all your needs. He will meet them in keeping with his wonderful riches. These riches come to you because you belong to Christ Jesus.
Philippians,4,20,Give glory to our God and Father for ever and ever. Amen.
Philippians,4,21,Greet all God’s people. They belong to Christ Jesus. The brothers and sisters who are with me send greetings.
Philippians,4,22,"All God’s people here send you greetings. Most of all, those who live in the palace of Caesar send you greetings."
Philippians,4,23,May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
