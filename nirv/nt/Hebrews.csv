Hebrews,1,1,"In the past, God spoke to our people through the prophets. He spoke at many times. He spoke in different ways."
Hebrews,1,2,"But in these last days, he has spoken to us through his Son. He is the one whom God appointed to receive all things. God also made everything through him."
Hebrews,1,3,"The Son is the shining brightness of God’s glory. He is the exact likeness of God’s being. He uses his powerful word to hold all things together. He provided the way for people to be made pure from sin. Then he sat down at the right hand of the King, the Majesty in heaven."
Hebrews,1,4,So he became higher than the angels. The name he received is more excellent than theirs.
Hebrews,1,5,"God never said to any of the angels, “You are my Son. Today I have become your Father.”( Psalm 2:7) Or, “I will be his Father. And he will be my Son.”( 2 Samuel 7:14; 1 Chronicles 17:13)"
Hebrews,1,6,"God’s first and only Son is over all things. When God brings him into the world, he says, “Let all God’s angels worship him.”( Deuteronomy 32:43)"
Hebrews,1,7,Here is something else God says about the angels. “God makes his angels to be like spirits. He makes those who serve him to be like flashes of lightning.”( Psalm 104:4)
Hebrews,1,8,But here is what he says about the Son. “You are God. Your throne will last for ever and ever. Your kingdom will be ruled by justice.
Hebrews,1,9,"You have loved what is right and hated what is evil. So your God has placed you above your companions. He has filled you with joy by pouring the sacred oil on your head.”( Psalm 45:6, 7)"
Hebrews,1,10,"He also says, “Lord, in the beginning you made the earth secure. You placed it on its foundations. The heavens are the work of your hands."
Hebrews,1,11,They will pass away. But you remain. They will all wear out like a piece of clothing.
Hebrews,1,12,You will roll them up like a robe. They will be changed as a person changes clothes. But you remain the same. Your years will never end.”( Psalm 102:25–27)
Hebrews,1,13,"God never said to an angel, “Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your control.”( Psalm 110:1)"
Hebrews,1,14,All angels are spirits who serve. God sends them to serve those who will receive salvation.
Hebrews,2,1,So we must pay the most careful attention to what we have heard. Then we will not drift away from it.
Hebrews,2,2,"Even the message God spoke through angels had to be obeyed. Every time people broke the Law, they were punished. Every time they didn’t obey, they were punished."
Hebrews,2,3,Then how will we escape if we don’t pay attention to God’s great salvation? The Lord first announced this salvation. Those who heard him gave us the message about it.
Hebrews,2,4,God showed that this message is true by signs and wonders. He showed that it’s true by different kinds of miracles. God also showed that this message is true by the gifts of the Holy Spirit. God gave them out as it pleased him.
Hebrews,2,5,God has not put angels in charge of the world that is going to come. We are talking about that world.
Hebrews,2,6,"There is a place where someone has spoken about this. He said, “What are human beings that you think about them? What is a son of man that you take care of him?"
Hebrews,2,7,You made them a little lower than the angels. You placed on them a crown of glory and honor.
Hebrews,2,8,You have put everything under their control.”( Psalm 8:4–6) So God has put everything under his Son. Everything is under his control. We do not now see everything under his control.
Hebrews,2,9,"But we do see Jesus already given a crown of glory and honor. He was made lower than the angels for a little while. He suffered death. By the grace of God, he tasted death for everyone. That is why he was given his crown."
Hebrews,2,10,God has made everything. He is now bringing his many sons and daughters to share in his glory. It is only right that Jesus is the one to lead them into their salvation. That’s because God made him perfect by his sufferings.
Hebrews,2,11,"And Jesus, who makes people holy, and the people he makes holy belong to the same family. So Jesus is not ashamed to call them his brothers and sisters."
Hebrews,2,12,"He says, “I will announce your name to my brothers and sisters. I will sing your praises among those who worship you.”( Psalm 22:22)"
Hebrews,2,13,"Again he says, “I will put my trust in him.”( Isaiah 8:17) And again he says, “Here I am. Here are the children God has given me.”( Isaiah 8:18)"
Hebrews,2,14,"Those children have bodies made out of flesh and blood. So Jesus became human like them in order to die for them. By doing this, he could break the power of the devil. The devil is the one who rules over the kingdom of death."
Hebrews,2,15,Jesus could set people free who were afraid of death. All their lives they were held as slaves by that fear.
Hebrews,2,16,It is certainly Abraham’s children that he helps. He doesn’t help angels.
Hebrews,2,17,"So he had to be made like people, fully human in every way. Then he could serve God as a kind and faithful high priest. And then he could pay for the sins of the people by dying for them."
Hebrews,2,18,He himself suffered when he was tempted. Now he is able to help others who are being tempted.
Hebrews,3,1,"Holy brothers and sisters, God chose you to be his people. So keep thinking about Jesus. We embrace him as our apostle and our high priest."
Hebrews,3,2,"Moses was faithful in everything he did in the house of God. In the same way, Jesus was faithful to the God who appointed him."
Hebrews,3,3,"The person who builds a house has greater honor than the house itself. In the same way, Jesus has been found worthy of greater honor than Moses."
Hebrews,3,4,Every house is built by someone. But God is the builder of everything.
Hebrews,3,5,“Moses was faithful as one who serves in the house of God.”( Numbers 12:7) He was a witness to what God would say in days to come.
Hebrews,3,6,But Christ is faithful as the Son over the house of God. And we are his house if we hold tightly to what we are certain about. We must also hold tightly to the hope we boast in.
Hebrews,3,7,"The Holy Spirit says, “Listen to his voice today."
Hebrews,3,8,"If you hear it, don’t be stubborn. You were stubborn when you opposed me. You did that when you were tested in the desert."
Hebrews,3,9,There your people of long ago tested me. Yet for 40 years they saw what I did.
Hebrews,3,10,"That is why I was angry with them. I said, ‘Their hearts are always going astray. They have not known my ways.’"
Hebrews,3,11,"So when I was angry, I made a promise. I said, ‘They will never enjoy the rest I planned for them.’ ”( Psalm 95:7–11)"
Hebrews,3,12,"Brothers and sisters, make sure that none of you has a sinful heart. Do not let an unbelieving heart turn you away from the living God."
Hebrews,3,13,But build one another up every day. Do it as long as there is still time. Then none of you will become stubborn. You won’t be fooled by sin’s tricks.
Hebrews,3,14,We belong to Christ if we hold tightly to the faith we had at first. But we must hold it tightly until the end.
Hebrews,3,15,"It has just been said, “Listen to his voice today. If you hear it, don’t be stubborn. You were stubborn when you opposed me.”( Psalm 95:7, 8)"
Hebrews,3,16,Who were those who heard and refused to obey? Weren’t they all the people Moses led out of Egypt?
Hebrews,3,17,Who was God angry with for 40 years? Wasn’t it with those who sinned? They died in the desert.
Hebrews,3,18,God promised that those people would never enjoy the rest he planned for them. God gave his word when he made that promise. Didn’t he make that promise to those who didn’t obey?
Hebrews,3,19,So we see that they weren’t able to enter. That’s because they didn’t believe.
Hebrews,4,1,God’s promise of enjoying his rest still stands. So be careful that none of you fails to receive it.
Hebrews,4,2,The good news was announced to our people of long ago. It has also been preached to us. The message they heard didn’t have any value for them. That’s because they didn’t share the faith of those who obeyed.
Hebrews,4,3,"Now we who have believed enjoy that rest. God said, “When I was angry, I made a promise. I said, ‘They will never enjoy the rest I planned for them.’ ”( Psalm 95:11) Ever since God created the world, his works have been finished."
Hebrews,4,4,"Somewhere he spoke about the seventh day. He said, “On the seventh day God rested from all his works.”( Genesis 2:2)"
Hebrews,4,5,"In the part of Scripture I talked about earlier God spoke. He said, “They will never enjoy the rest I planned for them.”( Psalm 95:11)"
Hebrews,4,6,It is still true that some people will enjoy this rest. But those who had the good news announced to them earlier didn’t go in. That’s because they didn’t obey.
Hebrews,4,7,"So God again chose a certain day. He named it Today. He did this when he spoke through David a long time later. Here is what was written in the Scripture already given. “Listen to his voice today. If you hear it, don’t be stubborn.”( Psalm 95:7, 8)"
Hebrews,4,8,"Suppose Joshua had given them rest. If he had, God would not have spoken later about another day."
Hebrews,4,9,So there is still a Sabbath rest for God’s people.
Hebrews,4,10,God rested from his work. Those who enjoy God’s rest also rest from their works.
Hebrews,4,11,So let us make every effort to enjoy that rest. Then no one will die by disobeying as they did.
Hebrews,4,12,The word of God is alive and active. It is sharper than any sword that has two edges. It cuts deep enough to separate soul from spirit. It can separate bones from joints. It judges the thoughts and purposes of the heart.
Hebrews,4,13,Nothing God created is hidden from him. His eyes see everything. He will hold us responsible for everything we do.
Hebrews,4,14,We have a great high priest. He has gone up into heaven. He is Jesus the Son of God. So let us hold firmly to what we say we believe.
Hebrews,4,15,"We have a high priest who can feel it when we are weak and hurting. We have a high priest who has been tempted in every way, just as we are. But he did not sin."
Hebrews,4,16,So let us boldly approach God’s throne of grace. Then we will receive mercy. We will find grace to help us when we need it.
Hebrews,5,1,Every high priest is chosen from among the people. He is appointed to act for the people. He acts for them in whatever has to do with God. He offers gifts and sacrifices for their sins.
Hebrews,5,2,Some people have gone astray without knowing it. He is able to deal gently with them. He can do that because he himself is weak.
Hebrews,5,3,That’s why he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins. He must also do it for the sins of the people.
Hebrews,5,4,"And no one can take this honor for himself. Instead, he receives it when he is appointed by God. That is just how it was for Aaron."
Hebrews,5,5,"It was the same for Christ. He did not take for himself the glory of becoming a high priest. But God said to him, “You are my Son. Today I have become your Father.”( Psalm 2:7)"
Hebrews,5,6,"In another place God said, “You are a priest forever, just like Melchizedek.”( Psalm 110:4)"
Hebrews,5,7,Jesus prayed while he lived on earth. He made his appeal with sincere cries and tears. He prayed to the God who could save him from death. God answered Jesus because he truly honored God.
Hebrews,5,8,Jesus was God’s Son. But by suffering he learned what it means to obey.
Hebrews,5,9,In this way he was made perfect. Eternal salvation comes from him. He saves all those who obey him.
Hebrews,5,10,"God appointed him to be the high priest, just like Melchizedek."
Hebrews,5,11,We have a lot to say about this. But it is hard to make it clear to you. That’s because you are no longer trying to understand.
Hebrews,5,12,"By this time you should be teachers. But in fact, you need someone to teach you all over again. You need even the simple truths of God’s word. You need milk, not solid food."
Hebrews,5,13,Anyone who lives on milk is still a baby. That person does not want to learn about living a godly life.
Hebrews,5,14,Solid food is for those who are grown up. They have trained themselves to tell the difference between good and evil. That shows they have grown up.
Hebrews,6,1,So let us move beyond the simple teachings about Christ. Let us grow up as believers. Let us not start all over again with the basic teachings. They taught us that we need to turn away from doing things that lead to death. They taught us that we must have faith in God.
Hebrews,6,2,These basic teachings taught us about different ways of becoming “clean.” They taught us about placing hands of blessing on people. They taught us that people will rise from the dead. They taught us that God will judge everyone. And they taught us that what he decides will last forever.
Hebrews,6,3,"If God permits, we will go beyond those teachings and grow up."
Hebrews,6,4,What if some people fall away from the faith? It won’t be possible to bring them back. It is true that they have seen the light. They have tasted the heavenly gift. They have shared in the Holy Spirit.
Hebrews,6,5,They have tasted the good things of God’s word. They have tasted the powers of the age to come.
Hebrews,6,6,But they have fallen away from the faith. So it won’t be possible to bring them back. They won’t be able to turn away from their sins. They are losing everything. That’s because they are nailing the Son of God to the cross all over again. They are bringing shame on him in front of everyone.
Hebrews,6,7,Some land drinks the rain that falls on it. It produces a crop that is useful to those who farm the land. That land receives God’s blessing.
Hebrews,6,8,"But other land produces only thorns and weeds. That land isn’t worth anything. It is in danger of coming under God’s curse. In the end, it will be burned."
Hebrews,6,9,"Dear friends, we have to say these things. But we are sure of better things in your case. We are talking about the things that have to do with being saved."
Hebrews,6,10,God is fair. He will not forget what you have done. He will remember the love you have shown him. You showed it when you helped his people. And you show it when you keep on helping them.
Hebrews,6,11,"We want each of you to be faithful to the very end. If you are, then what you hope for will fully happen."
Hebrews,6,12,"We don’t want you to slow down. Instead, be like those who have faith and are patient. They will receive what God promised."
Hebrews,6,13,"When God made his promise to Abraham, God gave his word. There was no one greater than himself to promise by. So he promised by making an appeal to himself."
Hebrews,6,14,"He said, “I will certainly bless you. I will give you many children.”( Genesis 22:17)"
Hebrews,6,15,Abraham was patient while he waited. Then he received what God promised him.
Hebrews,6,16,People promise things by someone greater than themselves. Giving your word makes a promise certain. It puts an end to all arguing.
Hebrews,6,17,So God gave his word when he made his promise. He wanted to make it very clear that his purpose does not change. He wanted those who would receive what was promised to know this.
Hebrews,6,18,"When God made his promise, he gave his word. He did this so we would have good reason not to give up. Instead, we have run to take hold of the hope set before us. This hope is set before us in God’s promise. So God made his promise and gave his word. These two things can’t change. He couldn’t lie about them."
Hebrews,6,19,Our hope is certain. It is something for the soul to hold on to. It is strong and secure. It goes all the way into the Most Holy Room behind the curtain.
Hebrews,6,20,"That is where Jesus has gone. He went there to open the way ahead of us. He has become a high priest forever, just like Melchizedek."
Hebrews,7,1,"Melchizedek was the king of Salem. He was the priest of God Most High. He met Abraham, who was returning from winning a battle over some kings. Melchizedek blessed him."
Hebrews,7,2,"Abraham gave him a tenth of everything. First, the name Melchizedek means “king of what is right.” Also, “king of Salem” means “king of peace.”"
Hebrews,7,3,"Melchizedek has no father or mother. He has no family line. His days have no beginning. His life has no end. He remains a priest forever. In this way, he is like the Son of God."
Hebrews,7,4,Think how great Melchizedek was! Even our father Abraham gave him a tenth of what he had captured.
Hebrews,7,5,"Now the law lays down a rule for the sons of Levi who become priests. They must collect a tenth from the people. They must collect it from the other Israelites. They must do this, even though all of them belong to the family line of Abraham."
Hebrews,7,6,Melchizedek did not trace his family line from Levi. But he collected a tenth from Abraham. Melchizedek blessed the one who had received the promises.
Hebrews,7,7,"Without a doubt, the more important person blesses the less important one."
Hebrews,7,8,"In the one case, the tenth is collected by people who die. But in the other case, it is collected by the one who is said to be living."
Hebrews,7,9,Levi collects the tenth. But we might say that Levi paid the tenth through Abraham.
Hebrews,7,10,"That’s because when Melchizedek met Abraham, Levi was still in Abraham’s body."
Hebrews,7,11,The law that was given to the people called for the priestly system. That system began with Levi. Suppose the priestly system could have made people perfect. Then why was there still a need for another priest to come? And why did he need to be like Melchizedek? Why wasn’t he from Aaron’s family line?
Hebrews,7,12,A change of the priestly system requires a change of law.
Hebrews,7,13,We are talking about a priest who is from a different tribe. No one from that tribe has ever served at the altar.
Hebrews,7,14,It is clear that our Lord came from the family line of Judah. Moses said nothing about priests who were from the tribe of Judah.
Hebrews,7,15,But suppose another priest like Melchizedek appears. Then what we have said is even more clear.
Hebrews,7,16,He has not become a priest because of a rule about his family line. He has become a priest because of his powerful life. His life can never be destroyed.
Hebrews,7,17,"Scripture says, “You are a priest forever, just like Melchizedek.”( Psalm 110:4)"
Hebrews,7,18,The old rule is set aside. It was weak and useless.
Hebrews,7,19,The law didn’t make anything perfect. Now a better hope has been given to us. That hope brings us near to God.
Hebrews,7,20,The change of priestly system was made with a promise. Others became priests without any promise.
Hebrews,7,21,"But Jesus became a priest with a promise. God said to him, “The Lord has given his word and made a promise. He will not change his mind. He has said, ‘You are a priest forever.’ ”( Psalm 110:4)"
Hebrews,7,22,"Because God gave his word, Jesus makes certain the promise of a better covenant."
Hebrews,7,23,There were many priests in Levi’s family line. Death kept them from continuing in office.
Hebrews,7,24,But Jesus lives forever. So he always holds the office of priest.
Hebrews,7,25,People now come to God through him. And he is able to save them completely and for all time. Jesus lives forever. He prays for them.
Hebrews,7,26,"A high priest like that really meets our need. He is holy, pure and without blame. He isn’t like other people. He does not sin. He is lifted high above the heavens."
Hebrews,7,27,He isn’t like the other high priests. They need to offer sacrifices day after day. First they bring offerings for their own sins. Then they do it for the sins of the people. But Jesus gave one sacrifice for the sins of the people. He gave it once and for all time. He did it by offering himself.
Hebrews,7,28,The law appoints as high priests men who are weak. But God’s promise came after the law. By his promise the Son was appointed. The Son has been made perfect forever.
Hebrews,8,1,"Here is the main point of what we are saying. We have a high priest like that. He sat down at the right hand of the throne of the King, the Majesty in heaven."
Hebrews,8,2,He serves in the sacred tent. The Lord set up the true holy tent. A mere human being did not set it up.
Hebrews,8,3,Every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices. So this priest also had to have something to offer.
Hebrews,8,4,What if he were on earth? Then he would not be a priest. There are already priests who offer the gifts required by the law.
Hebrews,8,5,"They serve at a sacred tent. But it is only a copy and shadow of what is in heaven. That’s why God warned Moses when he was about to build the holy tent. God said, “Be sure to make everything just like the pattern I showed you on the mountain.”( Exodus 25:40)"
Hebrews,8,6,But Jesus has been given a greater work to do for God. He is the go-between for the new covenant. This covenant is better than the old one. The new covenant is based on better promises.
Hebrews,8,7,Suppose nothing had been wrong with that first covenant. Then no one would have looked for another covenant.
Hebrews,8,8,"But God found fault with the people. He said, “The days are coming, announces the Lord. I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel. I will also make it with the people of Judah."
Hebrews,8,9,"It will not be like the covenant I made with their people of long ago. That was when I took them by the hand. I led them out of Egypt. My new covenant will be different because they didn’t remain faithful to my old covenant. So I turned away from them, announces the Lord."
Hebrews,8,10,"This is the covenant I will establish with the people of Israel after that time, says the Lord. I will put my laws in their minds. I will write them on their hearts. I will be their God. And they will be my people."
Hebrews,8,11,"People will not teach their neighbor anymore. They will not say to one another, ‘Know the Lord.’ That’s because everyone will know me. From the least important to the most important, all of them will know me."
Hebrews,8,12,I will forgive their evil ways. I will not remember their sins anymore.”( Jeremiah 31:31–34)
Hebrews,8,13,God called this covenant “new.” So he has done away with the first one. And what is out of date and has been done away with will soon disappear.
Hebrews,9,1,The first covenant had rules for worship. It also had a sacred tent on earth.
Hebrews,9,2,A holy tent was set up. The lampstand was in the first room. So was the table with its holy bread. That was called the Holy Room.
Hebrews,9,3,Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Room.
Hebrews,9,4,It had the golden altar for incense. It also had the wooden chest called the ark of the covenant. The ark was covered with gold. It held the gold jar of manna. It held Aaron’s walking stick that had budded. It also held the stone tablets. The words of the covenant were written on them.
Hebrews,9,5,The cherubim were above the ark. God showed his glory there. The cherubim spread their wings over the place where sin was paid for. But we can’t say everything about these things now.
Hebrews,9,6,That’s how everything was arranged in the holy tent. The priests entered it at regular times. They went into the outer room to do their work for God and others.
Hebrews,9,7,But only the high priest went into the inner room. He went in only once a year. He never entered without taking blood with him. He offered the blood for himself. He also offered it for the sins the people had committed because they didn’t know any better.
Hebrews,9,8,Here is what the Holy Spirit was showing us. He was telling us that God had not yet clearly shown the way into the Most Holy Room. It would not be clearly shown as long as the first holy tent was still being used.
Hebrews,9,9,That’s an example for the present time. It shows us that the gifts and sacrifices people offered were not enough. They were not able to remove the worshiper’s feelings of guilt.
Hebrews,9,10,They deal only with food and drink and different kinds of special washings. They are rules people had to obey only until the new covenant came.
Hebrews,9,11,"But Christ came to be the high priest of the good things already here now. When he came, he went through the greater and more perfect holy tent. This tent was not made with human hands. In other words, it is not a part of this creation."
Hebrews,9,12,"He did not enter by spilling the blood of goats and calves. He entered the Most Holy Room by spilling his own blood. He did it once and for all time. In this way, he paid the price to set us free from sin forever."
Hebrews,9,13,The blood of goats and bulls is sprinkled on people. So are the ashes of a young cow. They are sprinkled on people the law called “unclean.” The people are sprinkled to make them holy. That makes them “clean” on the outside.
Hebrews,9,14,But Christ offered himself to God without any flaw. He did this through the power of the eternal Holy Spirit. So how much cleaner will the blood of Christ make us! It washes away our feelings of guilt for committing sin. Sin always leads to death. But now we can serve the living God.
Hebrews,9,15,That’s why Christ is the go-between of a new covenant. Now those God calls to himself will receive the eternal gift he promised. They will receive it now that Christ has died to save them. He died to set them free from the sins they committed under the first covenant.
Hebrews,9,16,What happens when someone leaves a will? It is necessary to prove that the person who made the will has died.
Hebrews,9,17,A will is in effect only when somebody has died. It never takes effect while the one who made it is still living.
Hebrews,9,18,That’s why even the first covenant was not put into effect without the spilling of blood.
Hebrews,9,19,"Moses first announced every command of the law to all the people. Then he took the blood of calves. He also took water, bright red wool and branches of a hyssop plant. He sprinkled the Book of the Covenant. He also sprinkled all the people."
Hebrews,9,20,"He said, “This is the blood of the covenant God has commanded you to keep.”( Exodus 24:8)"
Hebrews,9,21,"In the same way, he sprinkled the holy tent with blood. He also sprinkled everything that was used in worship there."
Hebrews,9,22,"In fact, the law requires that nearly everything be made “clean” with blood. Without the spilling of blood, no one can be forgiven."
Hebrews,9,23,So the copies of the heavenly things had to be made pure with these sacrifices. But the heavenly things themselves had to be made pure with better sacrifices.
Hebrews,9,24,Christ did not enter a sacred tent made with human hands. That tent was only a copy of the true one. He entered heaven itself. He did it to stand in front of God for us. He is there right now.
Hebrews,9,25,The high priest enters the Most Holy Room every year. He enters with blood that is not his own. But Christ did not enter heaven to offer himself again and again.
Hebrews,9,26,"If he had, he would have had to suffer many times since the world was created. But he has appeared once and for all time. He has come at the time when God’s work is being completed. He has come to do away with sin by offering himself."
Hebrews,9,27,"People have to die once. After that, God will judge them."
Hebrews,9,28,"In the same way, Christ was offered up once. He took away the sins of many people. He will also come a second time. At that time he will not suffer for sin. Instead, he will come to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him."
Hebrews,10,1,The law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming. It is not the real things themselves. The same sacrifices have to be offered over and over again. They must be offered year after year. That’s why the law can never make perfect those who come near to worship.
Hebrews,10,2,"If the law could, wouldn’t the sacrifices have stopped being offered? The worshipers would have been made “clean” once and for all time. They would not have felt guilty for their sins anymore."
Hebrews,10,3,But those offerings remind people of their sins every year.
Hebrews,10,4,It isn’t possible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
Hebrews,10,5,"So when Christ came into the world, he said, “You didn’t want sacrifices and offerings. Instead, you prepared a body for me."
Hebrews,10,6,You weren’t pleased with burnt offerings and sin offerings.
Hebrews,10,7,"Then I said, ‘Here I am. It is written about me in the book. I have come to do what you want, my God.’ ”( Psalm 40:6–8)"
Hebrews,10,8,"First Christ said, “You didn’t want sacrifices and offerings. You didn’t want burnt offerings and sin offerings. You weren’t pleased with them.” He said this even though they were offered in keeping with the law."
Hebrews,10,9,"Then he said, “Here I am. I have come to do what you want.” He did away with the shadow of the good things that were coming. He did it to put in place the good things themselves."
Hebrews,10,10,We have been made holy by what God wanted. We have been made holy because Jesus Christ offered his body once and for all time.
Hebrews,10,11,Day after day every priest stands and does his special duties. He offers the same sacrifices again and again. But they can never take away sins.
Hebrews,10,12,Jesus our priest offered one sacrifice for sins for all time. Then he sat down at the right hand of God.
Hebrews,10,13,"And since that time, he waits for his enemies to be put under his control."
Hebrews,10,14,By that one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy.
Hebrews,10,15,"The Holy Spirit also speaks to us about this. First he says,"
Hebrews,10,16,"“This is the covenant I will make with them after that time, says the Lord. I will put my laws in their hearts. I will write my laws on their minds.”( Jeremiah 31:33)"
Hebrews,10,17,"Then he adds, “I will not remember their sins anymore. I will not remember the evil things they have done.”( Jeremiah 31:34)"
Hebrews,10,18,"Where these sins have been forgiven, an offering for sin is no longer necessary."
Hebrews,10,19,"Brothers and sisters, we are not afraid to enter the Most Holy Room. We enter boldly because of the blood of Jesus."
Hebrews,10,20,His way is new because he lives. It has been opened for us through the curtain. I’m talking about his body.
Hebrews,10,21,We also have a great priest over the house of God.
Hebrews,10,22,So let us come near to God with a sincere heart. Let us come near boldly because of our faith. Our hearts have been sprinkled. Our minds have been cleansed from a sense of guilt. Our bodies have been washed with pure water.
Hebrews,10,23,Let us hold firmly to the hope we claim to have. The God who promised is faithful.
Hebrews,10,24,Let us consider how we can stir up one another to love. Let us help one another to do good works.
Hebrews,10,25,"And let us not give up meeting together. Some are in the habit of doing this. Instead, let us encourage one another with words of hope. Let us do this even more as you see Christ’s return approaching."
Hebrews,10,26,What if we keep sinning on purpose? What if we do it even after we know the truth? Then there is no offering for our sins.
Hebrews,10,27,All we can do is to wait in fear for God to judge. His blazing fire will burn up his enemies.
Hebrews,10,28,Suppose someone did not obey the law of Moses. And suppose two or three witnesses made charges against them. That person would die without mercy.
Hebrews,10,29,People who deserve even more punishment include those who have hated the Son of God. They include people who have said no to him. They include people who have treated as unholy the blood of the covenant that makes them holy. They also include people who have disrespected the Holy Spirit who brings God’s grace. Don’t you think people like this should be punished more than anyone else?
Hebrews,10,30,"We know the God who said, “I am the God who judges people. I will pay them back.”( Deuteronomy 32:35) Scripture also says, “The Lord will judge his people.”( Deuteronomy 32:36; Psalm 135:14)"
Hebrews,10,31,It is a terrible thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
Hebrews,10,32,Remember those earlier days after you received the light. You remained strong in a great battle that was full of suffering.
Hebrews,10,33,Sometimes people spoke badly about you in front of others. Sometimes you were treated badly. At other times you stood side by side with people being treated like this.
Hebrews,10,34,"You suffered along with people in prison. When your property was taken from you, you accepted it with joy. You knew that God had given you better and more lasting things."
Hebrews,10,35,So don’t throw away your bold faith. It will bring you rich rewards.
Hebrews,10,36,You need to be faithful. Then you will do what God wants. You will receive what he has promised.
Hebrews,10,37,"“In just a little while, he who is coming will come. He will not wait any longer.”"
Hebrews,10,38,"And, “The one who is right with God will live by faith. And I am not pleased with the one who pulls back.”( Habakkuk 2:3, 4)"
Hebrews,10,39,But we don’t belong to the people who pull back and are destroyed. We belong to the people who believe and are saved.
Hebrews,11,1,Faith is being sure of what we hope for. It is being sure of what we do not see.
Hebrews,11,2,That is what the people of long ago were praised for.
Hebrews,11,3,We have faith. So we understand that everything was made when God commanded it. That’s why we believe that what we see was not made out of what could be seen.
Hebrews,11,4,Abel had faith. So he brought to God a better offering than Cain did. Because of his faith Abel was praised as a godly man. God said good things about his offerings. Because of his faith Abel still speaks. He speaks even though he is dead.
Hebrews,11,5,"Enoch had faith. So he was taken from this life. He didn’t die. “He couldn’t be found, because God had taken him away.”( Genesis 5:24) Before God took him, Enoch was praised as one who pleased God."
Hebrews,11,6,Without faith it is impossible to please God. Those who come to God must believe that he exists. And they must believe that he rewards those who look to him.
Hebrews,11,7,Noah had faith. So he built an ark to save his family. He built it because of his great respect for God. God had warned him about things that could not yet be seen. Because of his faith Noah showed the world that it was guilty. Because of his faith he was considered right with God.
Hebrews,11,8,Abraham had faith. So he obeyed God. God called him to go to a place he would later receive as his own. So he went. He did it even though he didn’t know where he was going.
Hebrews,11,9,Because of his faith he made his home in the land God had promised him. Abraham was like an outsider in a strange country. He lived there in tents. So did Isaac and Jacob. They received the same promise he did.
Hebrews,11,10,Abraham was looking forward to the city that has foundations. He was waiting for the city that God planned and built.
Hebrews,11,11,And Sarah had faith. So God made it possible for her to become a mother. She became a mother even though she was too old to have children. But Sarah believed that the God who made the promise was faithful.
Hebrews,11,12,Abraham was past the time when he could have children. But many children came from that one man. They were as many as the stars in the sky. They were as many as the grains of sand on the seashore. No one could count them.
Hebrews,11,13,All these people were still living by faith when they died. They didn’t receive the things God had promised. They only saw them and welcomed them from a long way off. They openly said that they were outsiders and strangers on earth.
Hebrews,11,14,People who say things like that show that they are looking for a country of their own.
Hebrews,11,15,What if they had been thinking of the country they had left? Then they could have returned to it.
Hebrews,11,16,"Instead, they longed for a better country. They wanted a heavenly one. So God is pleased when they call him their God. In fact, he has prepared a city for them."
Hebrews,11,17,"Abraham had faith. So when God tested him, Abraham offered Isaac as a sacrifice. Abraham had held on tightly to the promises. But he was about to offer his one and only son."
Hebrews,11,18,"God had said to him, “Your family line will continue through Isaac.”( Genesis 21:12) Even so, Abraham was going to offer him up."
Hebrews,11,19,"Abraham did this, because he believed that God could even raise the dead. In a way, he did receive Isaac back from death."
Hebrews,11,20,Isaac had faith. So he blessed Jacob and Esau. He told them what was ahead for them.
Hebrews,11,21,Jacob had faith. So he blessed each of Joseph’s sons. He blessed them when he was dying. Because of his faith he worshiped God. Jacob worshiped as he leaned on the top of his walking stick.
Hebrews,11,22,"Joseph had faith. So he spoke to the people of Israel about how they would leave Egypt someday. When his death was near, he spoke about where to bury his bones."
Hebrews,11,23,Moses’ parents had faith. So they hid him for three months after he was born. They saw he was a special child. They were not afraid of the king’s command.
Hebrews,11,24,Moses had faith. So he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter. That happened after he had grown up.
Hebrews,11,25,He chose to be treated badly together with the people of God. He chose not to enjoy sin’s pleasures. They only last for a short time.
Hebrews,11,26,He suffered shame because of Christ. He thought it had great value. Moses considered it better than the riches of Egypt. He was looking ahead to his reward.
Hebrews,11,27,"Because of his faith, Moses left Egypt. It wasn’t because he was afraid of the king’s anger. He didn’t let anything stop him. That’s because he saw the God who can’t be seen."
Hebrews,11,28,"Because of his faith, Moses was the first to keep the Passover Feast. He commanded the people of Israel to sprinkle blood on their doorways. He did it so that the destroying angel would not touch their oldest sons."
Hebrews,11,29,The people of Israel had faith. So they passed through the Red Sea. They went through it as if it were dry land. The Egyptians tried to do it also. But they drowned.
Hebrews,11,30,Israel’s army had faith. So the walls of Jericho fell down. It happened after they had marched around the city for seven days.
Hebrews,11,31,"Rahab, the prostitute, had faith. So she welcomed the spies. That’s why she wasn’t killed with those who didn’t obey God."
Hebrews,11,32,"What more can I say? I don’t have time to tell about all the others. I don’t have time to talk about Gideon, Barak, Samson and Jephthah. I don’t have time to tell about David and Samuel and the prophets."
Hebrews,11,33,Because of their faith they took over kingdoms. They ruled fairly. They received the blessings God had promised. They shut the mouths of lions.
Hebrews,11,34,They put out great fires. They escaped being killed by swords. Their weakness was turned to strength. They became powerful in battle. They beat back armies from other countries.
Hebrews,11,35,Women received back their dead. The dead were raised to life again. There were others who were made to suffer greatly. But they refused to be set free. They did this so that after death they would be raised to an even better life.
Hebrews,11,36,Some were made fun of and even whipped. Some were held by chains. Some were put in prison.
Hebrews,11,37,Some were killed with stones. Some were sawed in two. Some were killed by swords. They went around wearing the skins of sheep and goats. They were poor. They were attacked. They were treated badly.
Hebrews,11,38,The world was not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and mountains. They lived in caves. They lived in holes in the ground.
Hebrews,11,39,All these people were praised because they had faith. But none of them received what God had promised.
Hebrews,11,40,That’s because God had planned something better for us. So they would only be made perfect together with us.
Hebrews,12,1,A huge cloud of witnesses is all around us. So let us throw off everything that stands in our way. Let us throw off any sin that holds on to us so tightly. And let us keep on running the race marked out for us.
Hebrews,12,2,Let us keep looking to Jesus. He is the one who started this journey of faith. And he is the one who completes the journey of faith. He paid no attention to the shame of the cross. He suffered there because of the joy he was looking forward to. Then he sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
Hebrews,12,3,He made it through these attacks by sinners. So think about him. Then you won’t get tired. You won’t lose hope.
Hebrews,12,4,You struggle against sin. But you have not yet fought to the point of spilling your blood.
Hebrews,12,5,"Have you completely forgotten this word of hope? It speaks to you as a father to his children. It says, “My son, think of the Lord’s training as important. Do not lose hope when he corrects you."
Hebrews,12,6,"The Lord trains the one he loves. He corrects everyone he accepts as his son.”( Proverbs 3:11, 12)"
Hebrews,12,7,Put up with hard times. God uses them to train you. He is treating you as his children. What children are not trained by their parents?
Hebrews,12,8,God trains all his children. But what if he doesn’t train you? Then you are not really his children. You are not God’s true sons and daughters at all.
Hebrews,12,9,"Besides, we have all had human fathers who trained us. We respected them for it. How much more should we be trained by the Father of spirits and live!"
Hebrews,12,10,Our parents trained us for a little while. They did what they thought was best. But God trains us for our good. He does this so we may share in his holiness.
Hebrews,12,11,"No training seems pleasant at the time. In fact, it seems painful. But later on it produces a harvest of godliness and peace. It does this for those who have been trained by it."
Hebrews,12,12,So put your hands to work. Strengthen your legs for the journey.
Hebrews,12,13,"“Make level paths for your feet to walk on.”( Proverbs 4:26) Then those who have trouble walking won’t be disabled. Instead, they will be healed."
Hebrews,12,14,Try your best to live in peace with everyone. Try hard to be holy. Without holiness no one will see the Lord.
Hebrews,12,15,"Be sure that no one misses out on God’s grace. See to it that a bitter plant doesn’t grow up. If it does, it will cause trouble. And it will make many people impure."
Hebrews,12,16,See to it that no one commits sexual sins. See to it that no one is godless like Esau. He sold the rights to what he would receive as the oldest son. He sold them for a single meal.
Hebrews,12,17,"As you know, after that he wanted to receive his father’s blessing. But he was turned away. With tears he tried to get the blessing. But he couldn’t change what he had done."
Hebrews,12,18,"You haven’t come to a mountain that can be touched. You haven’t come to a mountain burning with fire. You haven’t come to darkness, gloom and storm."
Hebrews,12,19,"You haven’t come to a blast from God’s trumpet. You haven’t come to a voice speaking to you. When people heard that voice long ago, they begged it not to say anything more to them."
Hebrews,12,20,"What God commanded was too much for them. He said, “If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be killed with stones.”( Exodus 19:12, 13)"
Hebrews,12,21,"The sight was terrifying. Moses said, “I am trembling with fear.”( Deuteronomy 9:19)"
Hebrews,12,22,But you have come to Mount Zion. You have come to the city of the living God. This is the heavenly Jerusalem. You have come to a joyful gathering of angels. There are thousands and thousands of them.
Hebrews,12,23,"You have come to the church of God’s people. God’s first and only Son is over all things. God’s people share in what belongs to his Son. Their names are written in heaven. You have come to God, who is the Judge of all people. You have come to the spirits of godly people who have been made perfect."
Hebrews,12,24,You have come to Jesus. He is the go-between of a new covenant. You have come to the sprinkled blood. It promises better things than the blood of Abel.
Hebrews,12,25,Be sure that you don’t say no to the one who speaks. People did not escape when they said no to the one who warned them on earth. And what if we turn away from the one who warns us from heaven? How much less will we escape!
Hebrews,12,26,"At that time his voice shook the earth. But now he has promised, “Once more I will shake the earth. I will also shake the heavens.”( Haggai 2:6)"
Hebrews,12,27,The words “once more” point out that what can be shaken can be taken away. I’m talking about created things. Then what can’t be shaken will remain.
Hebrews,12,28,We are receiving a kingdom that can’t be shaken. So let us be thankful. Then we can worship God in a way that pleases him. Let us worship him with deep respect and wonder.
Hebrews,12,29,Our “God is like a fire that burns everything up.”( Deuteronomy 4:24)
Hebrews,13,1,Keep on loving one another as brothers and sisters.
Hebrews,13,2,"Don’t forget to welcome outsiders. By doing that, some people have welcomed angels without knowing it."
Hebrews,13,3,Keep on remembering those in prison. Do this as if you were together with them in prison. And remember those who are treated badly as if you yourselves were suffering.
Hebrews,13,4,All of you should honor marriage. You should keep the marriage bed pure. God will judge the person who commits adultery. He will judge everyone who commits sexual sins.
Hebrews,13,5,"Don’t be controlled by love for money. Be happy with what you have. God has said, “I will never leave you. I will never desert you.”( Deuteronomy 31:6)"
Hebrews,13,6,"So we can say boldly, “The Lord helps me. I will not be afraid. What can mere human beings do to me?”( Psalm 118:6, 7)"
Hebrews,13,7,Remember your leaders. They spoke God’s word to you. Think about the results of their way of life. Copy their faith.
Hebrews,13,8,Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.
Hebrews,13,9,Don’t let all kinds of strange teachings lead you astray. It is good that God’s grace makes our hearts strong. Don’t try to grow strong by eating foods that the law requires. They have no value for the people who eat them.
Hebrews,13,10,"The priests, who are Levites, worship at the holy tent. But we have an altar that they have no right to eat from."
Hebrews,13,11,The high priest carries the blood of animals into the Most Holy Room. He brings their blood as a sin offering. But the bodies are burned outside the camp.
Hebrews,13,12,Jesus also suffered outside the city gate. He suffered to make the people holy by spilling his own blood.
Hebrews,13,13,So let us go to him outside the camp. Let us be willing to suffer the shame he suffered.
Hebrews,13,14,Here we do not have a city that lasts. But we are looking for the city that is going to come.
Hebrews,13,15,So let us never stop offering to God our praise through Jesus. Let us talk openly about our faith in him. Then our words will be like an offering to God.
Hebrews,13,16,Don’t forget to do good. Don’t forget to share with others. God is pleased with those kinds of offerings.
Hebrews,13,17,"Trust in your leaders. Put yourselves under their authority. Do this, because they keep watch over you. They know they are accountable to God for everything they do. Do this, so that their work will be a joy. If you make their work a heavy load, it won’t do you any good."
Hebrews,13,18,Pray for us. We feel sure we have done what is right. We desire to live as we should in every way.
Hebrews,13,19,I beg you to pray that I may return to you soon.
Hebrews,13,20,Our Lord Jesus is the great Shepherd of the sheep. The God who gives peace brought him back from the dead. He did it because of the blood of the eternal covenant. Now may God
Hebrews,13,21,supply you with everything good. Then you can do what he wants. May he do in us what is pleasing to him. We can do it only with the help of Jesus Christ. Give him glory for ever and ever. Amen.
Hebrews,13,22,"Brothers and sisters, I beg you to accept my word. It tells you to be faithful. Accept my word because I have written to you only a short letter."
Hebrews,13,23,"I want you to know that our brother Timothy has been set free. If he arrives soon, I will come with him to see you."
Hebrews,13,24,Greet all your leaders. Greet all the Lord’s people. The believers from Italy send you their greetings.
Hebrews,13,25,May grace be with you all.
