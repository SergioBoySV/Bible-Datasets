1 Timothy,1,1,"I, Paul, am writing this letter. I am an apostle of Christ Jesus, just as God our Savior commanded. Christ Jesus also commanded it. We have put our hope in him."
1 Timothy,1,2,"Timothy, I am sending you this letter. You are my true son in the faith. May God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord give you grace, mercy and peace."
1 Timothy,1,3,"Timothy, stay there in Ephesus. That is what I told you to do when I went into Macedonia. I want you to command certain people not to teach things that aren’t true."
1 Timothy,1,4,And command them not to spend their time on stories that are made up. They must not waste time on family histories that never end. These things only lead to fights about ideas. They don’t help God’s work move forward. His work is done by faith.
1 Timothy,1,5,Love is the purpose of my command. Love comes from a pure heart. It comes from a good sense of what is right and wrong. It comes from faith that is honest and true.
1 Timothy,1,6,Some have turned from these teachings. They would rather talk about things that have no meaning.
1 Timothy,1,7,They want to be teachers of the law. And they are very sure about that law. But they don’t know what they are talking about.
1 Timothy,1,8,We know that the law is good if it is used properly.
1 Timothy,1,9,We also know that the law isn’t made for godly people. It is made for those who break the law. It is for those who refuse to obey. It is for ungodly and sinful people. It is for those who aren’t holy and who don’t believe. It is for those who kill their fathers or mothers. It is for murderers.
1 Timothy,1,10,It is for those who commit sexual sins. It is for those who commit homosexual acts. It is for people who buy and sell slaves. It is for liars. It is for people who tell lies in court. It is for those who are a witness to things that aren’t true. And it is for anything else that is the opposite of true teaching.
1 Timothy,1,11,True teaching agrees with the good news about the glory of the blessed God. He trusted me with that good news.
1 Timothy,1,12,I am thankful to Christ Jesus our Lord. He has given me strength. I thank him that he considered me faithful. I thank him for appointing me to serve him.
1 Timothy,1,13,I used to speak evil things against Jesus. I tried to hurt his followers. I really pushed them around. But God showed me mercy anyway. I did those things without knowing any better. I wasn’t a believer.
1 Timothy,1,14,Our Lord poured out more and more of his grace on me. Along with it came faith and love from Christ Jesus.
1 Timothy,1,15,Here is a saying that you can trust. It should be accepted completely. Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners. And I am the worst sinner of all.
1 Timothy,1,16,"But for that very reason, God showed me mercy. And I am the worst of sinners. He showed me mercy so that Christ Jesus could show that he is very patient. I was an example for those who would come to believe in him. Then they would receive eternal life."
1 Timothy,1,17,The eternal King will never die. He can’t be seen. He is the only God. Give him honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.
1 Timothy,1,18,"My son Timothy, I am giving you this command. It is in keeping with the prophecies once made about you. By remembering them, you can fight the battle well."
1 Timothy,1,19,Then you will hold on to faith. You will hold on to a good sense of what is right and wrong. Some have not accepted this knowledge of right and wrong. So they have destroyed their faith. They are like a ship that has sunk.
1 Timothy,1,20,Hymenaeus and Alexander are among them. I have handed them over to Satan. That will teach them not to speak evil things against God.
1 Timothy,2,1,"First, I want you to pray for all people. Ask God to help and bless them. Give thanks for them."
1 Timothy,2,2,Pray for kings. Pray for everyone who is in authority. Pray that we can live peaceful and quiet lives. And pray that we will be godly and holy.
1 Timothy,2,3,"This is good, and it pleases God our Savior."
1 Timothy,2,4,He wants all people to be saved. He wants them to come to know the truth.
1 Timothy,2,5,There is only one God. And there is only one go-between for God and human beings. He is the man Christ Jesus.
1 Timothy,2,6,He gave himself to pay for the sins of all people. We have been told this message at just the right time.
1 Timothy,2,7,I was appointed to be a messenger and an apostle to preach the good news. I am telling the truth. I’m not lying. God appointed me to be a true and faithful teacher of the Gentiles.
1 Timothy,2,8,So I want the men in every place to pray. I want them to lift up holy hands. I don’t want them to be angry when they pray. I don’t want them to argue.
1 Timothy,2,9,"In the same way, I want the women to be careful how they dress. They should wear clothes that are right and proper. They shouldn’t wear their hair in very fancy styles. They shouldn’t wear gold or pearls. They shouldn’t wear clothes that cost a lot of money."
1 Timothy,2,10,"Instead, they should put on good works as if good works were their clothes. This is proper for women who claim to worship God."
1 Timothy,2,11,"When a woman is learning, she should be quiet. She should follow her leaders in every way."
1 Timothy,2,12,I do not let women teach or take authority over a man. They must be quiet.
1 Timothy,2,13,That’s because Adam was made first. Then Eve was made.
1 Timothy,2,14,Adam was not the one who was tricked. The woman was tricked and became a sinner.
1 Timothy,2,15,"Will women be saved by having children? Only if they keep on believing, loving, and leading a holy life in a proper way."
1 Timothy,3,1,"Here is a saying you can trust. If anyone wants to be a leader in the church, they want to do a good work for God and people."
1 Timothy,3,2,"A leader must be free from blame. He must be faithful to his wife. In anything he does, he must not go too far. He must control himself. He must be worthy of respect. He must welcome people into his home. He must be able to teach."
1 Timothy,3,3,He must not get drunk. He must not push people around. He must be gentle. He must not be a person who likes to argue. He must not love money.
1 Timothy,3,4,He must manage his own family well. He must make sure that his children obey him. And he must do this in a way that gains him respect.
1 Timothy,3,5,Suppose someone doesn’t know how to manage his own family. Then how can he take care of God’s church?
1 Timothy,3,6,"The leader must not be a new believer. If he is, he might become proud. Then he would be judged just like the devil."
1 Timothy,3,7,The leader must also be respected by those who are outside the church. Then he will not be put to shame. He will not fall into the devil’s trap.
1 Timothy,3,8,"In the same way, deacons must be worthy of respect. They must be honest and true. They must not drink too much wine. They must not try to get money by cheating people."
1 Timothy,3,9,They must hold on to the deep truths of the faith. Even their own minds tell them to do that.
1 Timothy,3,10,First they must be tested. Then let them serve as deacons if there is nothing against them.
1 Timothy,3,11,"In the same way, the women must be worthy of respect. They must not say things that harm others. In anything they do, they must not go too far. They must be worthy of trust in everything."
1 Timothy,3,12,A deacon must be faithful to his wife. He must manage his children and family well.
1 Timothy,3,13,Those who have served well earn the full respect of others. They also become more sure of their faith in Christ Jesus.
1 Timothy,3,14,I hope I can come to you soon. But now I am writing these instructions to you.
1 Timothy,3,15,"Then if I have to put off my visit, you will know how people should act in God’s family. The family of God is the church of the living God. It is the pillar and foundation of the truth."
1 Timothy,3,16,There is no doubt that true godliness comes from this great mystery. Jesus came as a human being. The Holy Spirit proved that he was the Son of God. He was seen by angels. He was preached among the nations. People in the world believed in him. He was taken up to heaven in glory.
1 Timothy,4,1,The Holy Spirit clearly says that in the last days some people will leave the faith. They will follow spirits that will fool them. They will believe things that demons will teach them.
1 Timothy,4,2,Teachings like those come from liars who pretend to be what they are not. Their sense of what is right and wrong has been destroyed. It’s as though it has been burned with a hot iron.
1 Timothy,4,3,They do not allow people to get married. They order them not to eat certain foods. But God created those foods. So people who believe and know the truth should receive them and give thanks for them.
1 Timothy,4,4,"Everything God created is good. You shouldn’t turn anything down. Instead, you should thank God for it."
1 Timothy,4,5,The word of God and prayer make it holy.
1 Timothy,4,6,Point out these things to the brothers and sisters. Then you will serve Christ Jesus well. You will show that you’ve grown in the truths of the faith. You will show that you’ve been trained by the good teaching you’ve obeyed.
1 Timothy,4,7,"Don’t have anything to do with godless stories and silly tales. Instead, train yourself to be godly."
1 Timothy,4,8,Training the body has some value. But being godly has value in every way. It promises help for the life you are now living and the life to come.
1 Timothy,4,9,This is the truth you can trust and accept completely.
1 Timothy,4,10,"This is why we work and try so hard. It’s because we have put our hope in the living God. He is the Savior of all people. Most of all, he is the Savior of those who believe."
1 Timothy,4,11,Command and teach these things.
1 Timothy,4,12,Don’t let anyone look down on you because you are young. Set an example for the believers in what you say and in how you live. Also set an example in how you love and in what you believe. Show the believers how to be pure.
1 Timothy,4,13,"Until I come, spend your time reading Scripture out loud to one another. Spend your time preaching and teaching."
1 Timothy,4,14,Don’t fail to use the gift the Holy Spirit gave you. He gave it to you through a prophecy from God. It was given when the elders placed their hands on you.
1 Timothy,4,15,Keep on doing these things. Give them your complete attention. Then everyone will see how you are coming along.
1 Timothy,4,16,Be careful of how you live and what you believe. Never give up. Then you will save yourself and those who hear you.
1 Timothy,5,1,Correct an older man in a way that shows respect. Make an appeal to him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as if they were your brothers.
1 Timothy,5,2,Treat older women as if they were your mothers. Treat younger women as if they were your sisters. Be completely pure in the way you treat them.
1 Timothy,5,3,Take care of the widows who really need help.
1 Timothy,5,4,But suppose a widow has children or grandchildren. They should first learn to put their faith into practice. They should care for their own family. In that way they will pay back their parents and grandparents. That pleases God.
1 Timothy,5,5,A widow who really needs help and is left all alone puts her hope in God. Night and day she keeps on praying. Night and day she asks God for help.
1 Timothy,5,6,But a widow who lives for pleasure is dead even while she is still living.
1 Timothy,5,7,Give these instructions to the people. Then no one can be blamed.
1 Timothy,5,8,"Everyone should provide for their own relatives. Most of all, everyone should take care of their own family. If they don’t, they have left the faith. They are worse than someone who doesn’t believe."
1 Timothy,5,9,No widow should be put on the list of widows unless she is more than 60 years old. She must also have been faithful to her husband.
1 Timothy,5,10,She must be well known for the good things she does. That includes bringing up children. It includes inviting guests into her home. It includes washing the feet of the Lord’s people. It includes helping those who are in trouble. A widow should spend her time doing all kinds of good things.
1 Timothy,5,11,Don’t put younger widows on that kind of list. They might want pleasure more than they want Christ. Then they would want to get married again.
1 Timothy,5,12,"If they do that, they will be judged. They have broken their first promise."
1 Timothy,5,13,"Besides, they get into the habit of having nothing to do. They go around from house to house. They waste their time. They also bother other people and say things that make no sense. They shouldn’t say those things."
1 Timothy,5,14,So here is the advice I give to younger widows. Get married. Have children. Take care of your own homes. Don’t give the enemy the chance to tell lies about you.
1 Timothy,5,15,"In fact, some have already turned away to follow Satan."
1 Timothy,5,16,Suppose a woman is a believer and takes care of widows. She should continue to help them. She shouldn’t let the church pay the expenses. Then the church can help the widows who really need it.
1 Timothy,5,17,The elders who do the church’s work well are worth twice as much honor. That is true in a special way of elders who preach and teach.
1 Timothy,5,18,"Scripture says, “Do not stop an ox from eating while it helps separate the grain from the straw.”( Deuteronomy 25:4) Scripture also says, “Workers are worthy of their pay.”( Luke 10:7)"
1 Timothy,5,19,Don’t believe a charge against an elder unless two or three witnesses bring it.
1 Timothy,5,20,But those elders who are sinning should be corrected in front of everyone. This will be a warning to the others.
1 Timothy,5,21,I command you to follow these instructions. I command you in the sight of God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels. Treat everyone the same. Don’t favor one person over another.
1 Timothy,5,22,Don’t be too quick to place your hands on others to set them apart to serve God. Don’t take part in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure.
1 Timothy,5,23,"Stop drinking only water. If your stomach is upset, drink a little wine. It can also help the other sicknesses you often have."
1 Timothy,5,24,The sins of some people are easy to see. They are already being judged. Others will be judged later.
1 Timothy,5,25,"In the same way, good works are easy to see. But even good works that are hard to see can’t stay hidden forever."
1 Timothy,6,1,All who are forced to serve as slaves should consider their masters worthy of full respect. Then people will not speak evil things against God’s name and against what we teach.
1 Timothy,6,2,"Some slaves have masters who are believers. They shouldn’t show their masters disrespect just because they are also believers. Instead, they should serve them even better. That’s because their masters are loved by them as believers. These masters are committed to caring for their slaves. These are the things you are to teach. Try hard to get the believers to do them."
1 Timothy,6,3,Suppose someone teaches something different than I have taught. Suppose that person doesn’t agree with the true teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ. Suppose they don’t agree with godly teaching.
1 Timothy,6,4,"Then that person is proud and doesn’t understand anything. They like to argue more than they should. They can’t agree about what words mean. All of this results in wanting what others have. It causes fighting, harmful talk, and evil distrust."
1 Timothy,6,5,It stirs up trouble all the time among people whose minds are twisted by sin. The truth they once had has been taken away from them. They think they can get rich by being godly.
1 Timothy,6,6,You gain a lot when you live a godly life. But you must be happy with what you have.
1 Timothy,6,7,We didn’t bring anything into the world. We can’t take anything out of it.
1 Timothy,6,8,"If we have food and clothing, we will be happy with that."
1 Timothy,6,9,People who want to get rich are tempted. They fall into a trap. They are tripped up by wanting many foolish and harmful things. Those who live like that are dragged down by what they do. They are destroyed and die.
1 Timothy,6,10,Love for money causes all kinds of evil. Some people want to get rich. They have wandered away from the faith. They have wounded themselves with many sorrows.
1 Timothy,6,11,"But you are a man of God. Run away from all these things. Try hard to do what is right and godly. Have faith, love and gentleness. Hold on to what you believe."
1 Timothy,6,12,Fight the good fight along with all other believers. Take hold of eternal life. You were chosen for it when you openly told others what you believe. Many witnesses heard you.
1 Timothy,6,13,"God gives life to everything. Christ Jesus told the truth when he was a witness in front of Pontius Pilate. In the sight of God and Christ, I give you a command."
1 Timothy,6,14,Obey it until our Lord Jesus Christ appears. Obey it completely. Then no one can find fault with it or you.
1 Timothy,6,15,God will bring Jesus back at a time that pleases him. God is the blessed and only Ruler. He is the greatest King of all. He is the most powerful Lord of all.
1 Timothy,6,16,God is the only one who can’t die. He lives in light that no one can get close to. No one has seen him. No one can see him. Honor and power belong to him forever. Amen.
1 Timothy,6,17,Command people who are rich in this world not to be proud. Tell them not to put their hope in riches. Wealth is so uncertain. Command those who are rich to put their hope in God. He richly provides us with everything to enjoy.
1 Timothy,6,18,Command the rich to do what is good. Tell them to be rich in doing good things. They must give freely. They must be willing to share.
1 Timothy,6,19,"In this way, they will store up true riches for themselves. It will provide a firm basis for the next life. Then they will take hold of the life that really is life."
1 Timothy,6,20,"Timothy, guard what God has trusted you with. Turn away from godless chatter. Stay away from opposing ideas that are falsely called knowledge."
1 Timothy,6,21,Some people believe them. By doing that they have turned away from the faith. May God’s grace be with you all.
