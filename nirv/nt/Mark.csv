Mark,1,1,"This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God."
Mark,1,2,"Long ago Isaiah the prophet wrote, “I will send my messenger ahead of you. He will prepare your way.”( Malachi 3:1)"
Mark,1,3,"“A messenger is calling out in the desert, ‘Prepare the way for the Lord. Make straight paths for him.’ ”( Isaiah 40:3)"
Mark,1,4,And so John the Baptist appeared in the desert. He preached that people should be baptized and turn away from their sins. Then God would forgive them.
Mark,1,5,"All the people from the countryside of Judea went out to him. All the people from Jerusalem went too. When they admitted they had sinned, John baptized them in the Jordan River."
Mark,1,6,John wore clothes made out of camel’s hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. And he ate locusts and wild honey.
Mark,1,7,"Here is what John was preaching. “After me, there is someone coming who is more powerful than I am. I’m not good enough to bend down and untie his sandals."
Mark,1,8,I baptize you with water. But he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”
Mark,1,9,At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee. John baptized Jesus in the Jordan River.
Mark,1,10,Jesus was coming up out of the water. Just then he saw heaven being torn open. Jesus saw the Holy Spirit coming down on him like a dove.
Mark,1,11,"A voice spoke to him from heaven. It said, “You are my Son, and I love you. I am very pleased with you.”"
Mark,1,12,At once the Holy Spirit sent Jesus out into the desert.
Mark,1,13,He was in the desert 40 days. There Satan tempted him. The wild animals didn’t harm Jesus. Angels took care of him.
Mark,1,14,"After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee. He preached the good news of God."
Mark,1,15,"“The time has come,” he said. “The kingdom of God has come near. Turn away from your sins and believe the good news!”"
Mark,1,16,One day Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were throwing a net into the lake. They were fishermen.
Mark,1,17,"“Come and follow me,” Jesus said. “I will send you out to fish for people.”"
Mark,1,18,At once they left their nets and followed him.
Mark,1,19,"Then Jesus walked a little farther. As he did, he saw James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat preparing their nets."
Mark,1,20,Right away he called out to them. They left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men. Then they followed Jesus.
Mark,1,21,"Jesus and those with him went to Capernaum. When the Sabbath day came, he went into the synagogue. There he began to teach."
Mark,1,22,The people were amazed at his teaching. That’s because he taught them like one who had authority. He did not talk like the teachers of the law.
Mark,1,23,"Just then a man in their synagogue cried out. He was controlled by an evil spirit. He said,"
Mark,1,24,"“What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!”"
Mark,1,25,“Be quiet!” said Jesus firmly. “Come out of him!”
Mark,1,26,The evil spirit shook the man wildly. Then it came out of him with a scream.
Mark,1,27,"All the people were amazed. So they asked each other, “What is this? A new teaching! And with so much authority! He even gives orders to evil spirits, and they obey him.”"
Mark,1,28,News about Jesus spread quickly all over Galilee.
Mark,1,29,Jesus and those with him left the synagogue. Right away they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.
Mark,1,30,Simon’s mother-in-law was lying in bed with a fever. They told Jesus about her right away.
Mark,1,31,So he went to her. He took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her. Then she began to serve them.
Mark,1,32,"That evening after sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who were sick. They also brought all who were controlled by demons."
Mark,1,33,All the people in town gathered at the door.
Mark,1,34,"Jesus healed many of them. They had all kinds of sicknesses. He also drove out many demons. But he would not let the demons speak, because they knew who he was."
Mark,1,35,It was very early in the morning and still dark. Jesus got up and left the house. He went to a place where he could be alone. There he prayed.
Mark,1,36,Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus.
Mark,1,37,"When they found him, they called out, “Everyone is looking for you!”"
Mark,1,38,"Jesus replied, “Let’s go somewhere else. I want to go to the nearby towns. I must preach there also. That is why I have come.”"
Mark,1,39,So he traveled all around Galilee. He preached in their synagogues. He also drove out demons.
Mark,1,40,"A man who had a skin disease came to Jesus. On his knees he begged Jesus. He said, “If you are willing to make me ‘clean,’ you can do it.”"
Mark,1,41,"Jesus became angry. He reached out his hand and touched the man. “I am willing to do it,” Jesus said. “Be ‘clean’!”"
Mark,1,42,"Right away the disease left the man, and he was “clean.”"
Mark,1,43,Jesus sent him away at once. He gave the man a strong warning.
Mark,1,44,"“Don’t tell this to anyone,” he said. “Go and show yourself to the priest. Offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded. It will be a witness to the priest and the people that you are ‘clean.’ ”"
Mark,1,45,But the man went out and started talking right away. He spread the news to everyone. So Jesus could no longer enter a town openly. He stayed outside in lonely places. But people still came to him from everywhere.
Mark,2,1,"A few days later, Jesus entered Capernaum again. The people heard that he had come home."
Mark,2,2,So many people gathered that there was no room left. There was not even room outside the door. And Jesus preached the word to them.
Mark,2,3,Four of those who came were carrying a man who could not walk.
Mark,2,4,But they could not get him close to Jesus because of the crowd. So they made a hole by digging through the roof above Jesus. Then they lowered the man through it on a mat.
Mark,2,5,"Jesus saw their faith. So he said to the man, “Son, your sins are forgiven.”"
Mark,2,6,"Some teachers of the law were sitting there. They were thinking,"
Mark,2,7,“Why is this fellow talking like that? He’s saying a very evil thing! Only God can forgive sins!”
Mark,2,8,"Right away Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said to them, “Why are you thinking these things?"
Mark,2,9,"Is it easier to say to this man, ‘Your sins are forgiven’? Or to say, ‘Get up, take your mat and walk’?"
Mark,2,10,But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.” So Jesus spoke to the man who could not walk.
Mark,2,11,"“I tell you,” he said, “get up. Take your mat and go home.”"
Mark,2,12,"The man got up and took his mat. Then he walked away while everyone watched. All the people were amazed. They praised God and said, “We have never seen anything like this!”"
Mark,2,13,Once again Jesus went out beside the Sea of Galilee. A large crowd came to him. He began to teach them.
Mark,2,14,"As he walked along he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus. Levi was sitting at the tax collector’s booth. “Follow me,” Jesus told him. Levi got up and followed him."
Mark,2,15,Later Jesus was having dinner at Levi’s house. Many tax collectors and sinners were eating with him and his disciples. They were part of the large crowd following Jesus.
Mark,2,16,"Some teachers of the law who were Pharisees were there. They saw Jesus eating with sinners and tax collectors. So they asked his disciples, “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?”"
Mark,2,17,"Jesus heard that. So he said to them, “Those who are healthy don’t need a doctor. Sick people do. I have not come to get those who think they are right with God to follow me. I have come to get sinners to follow me.”"
Mark,2,18,"John’s disciples and the Pharisees were going without eating. Some people came to Jesus. They said to him, “John’s disciples are fasting. The disciples of the Pharisees are also fasting. But your disciples are not. Why aren’t they?”"
Mark,2,19,"Jesus answered, “How can the guests of the groom go without eating while he is with them? They will not fast as long as he is with them."
Mark,2,20,But the time will come when the groom will be taken away from them. On that day they will go without eating.
Mark,2,21,"“No one sews a patch of new cloth on old clothes. Otherwise, the new piece will pull away from the old. That will make the tear worse."
Mark,2,22,"No one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the wine will burst the skins. Then the wine and the wineskins will both be destroyed. No, people pour new wine into new wineskins.”"
Mark,2,23,One Sabbath day Jesus was walking with his disciples through the grainfields. The disciples began to break off some heads of grain.
Mark,2,24,"The Pharisees said to Jesus, “Look! It is against the Law to do this on the Sabbath day. Why are your disciples doing it?”"
Mark,2,25,"He answered, “Haven’t you ever read about what David did? He and his men were hungry. They needed food."
Mark,2,26,It was when Abiathar was high priest. David entered the house of God and ate the holy bread. Only priests were allowed to eat it. David also gave some to his men.”
Mark,2,27,"Then Jesus said to them, “The Sabbath day was made for man. Man was not made for the Sabbath day."
Mark,2,28,So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath day.”
Mark,3,1,Another time Jesus went into the synagogue. A man with a weak and twisted hand was there.
Mark,3,2,Some Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They watched him closely. They wanted to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath day.
Mark,3,3,"Jesus spoke to the man with the weak and twisted hand. “Stand up in front of everyone,” he said."
Mark,3,4,"Then Jesus asked them, “What does the Law say we should do on the Sabbath day? Should we do good? Or should we do evil? Should we save life? Or should we kill?” But no one answered."
Mark,3,5,"Jesus looked around at them in anger. He was very upset because their hearts were stubborn. Then he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out, and his hand had become as good as new."
Mark,3,6,Then the Pharisees went out and began to make plans with the Herodians. They wanted to kill Jesus.
Mark,3,7,Jesus went off to the Sea of Galilee with his disciples. A large crowd from Galilee followed.
Mark,3,8,"People heard about all that Jesus was doing. And many came to him. They came from Judea, Jerusalem and Idumea. They came from the lands east of the Jordan River. And they came from the area around Tyre and Sidon."
Mark,3,9,"Because of the crowd, Jesus told his disciples to get a small boat ready for him. This would keep the people from crowding him."
Mark,3,10,Jesus had healed many people. So those who were sick were pushing forward to touch him.
Mark,3,11,"When people controlled by evil spirits saw him, they fell down in front of him. The spirits shouted, “You are the Son of God!”"
Mark,3,12,But Jesus ordered them not to tell people about him.
Mark,3,13,"Jesus went up on a mountainside. He called for certain people to come to him, and they came."
Mark,3,14,He appointed 12 of them so that they would be with him. He would also send them out to preach.
Mark,3,15,And he gave them authority to drive out demons.
Mark,3,16,So Jesus appointed the 12 disciples. Simon was one of them. Jesus gave him the name Peter.
Mark,3,17,"There were James, son of Zebedee, and his brother John. Jesus gave them the name Boanerges. Boanerges means Sons of Thunder."
Mark,3,18,"There were also Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, and James, son of Alphaeus. And there were Thaddaeus and Simon the Zealot."
Mark,3,19,Judas Iscariot was one of them too. He was the one who was later going to hand Jesus over to his enemies.
Mark,3,20,Jesus entered a house. Again a crowd gathered. It was so large that Jesus and his disciples were not even able to eat.
Mark,3,21,"His family heard about this. So they went to take charge of him. They said, “He is out of his mind.”"
Mark,3,22,"Some teachers of the law were there. They had come down from Jerusalem. They said, “He is controlled by Beelzebul! He is driving out demons by the power of the prince of demons.”"
Mark,3,23,"So Jesus called them over to him. He began to speak to them using stories. He said, “How can Satan drive out Satan?"
Mark,3,24,"If a kingdom fights against itself, it can’t stand."
Mark,3,25,"If a family is divided, it can’t stand."
Mark,3,26,"And if Satan fights against himself, and his helpers are divided, he can’t stand. That is the end of him."
Mark,3,27,"In fact, none of you can enter a strong man’s house unless you tie him up first. Then you can steal things from his house."
Mark,3,28,What I’m about to tell you is true. Everyone’s sins and evil words against God will be forgiven.
Mark,3,29,But whoever speaks evil things against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven. Their guilt will last forever.”
Mark,3,30,"Jesus said this because the teachers of the law were saying, “He has an evil spirit.”"
Mark,3,31,Jesus’ mother and brothers came and stood outside. They sent someone in to get him.
Mark,3,32,"A crowd was sitting around Jesus. They told him, “Your mother and your brothers are outside. They are looking for you.”"
Mark,3,33,“Who is my mother? Who are my brothers?” he asked.
Mark,3,34,"Then Jesus looked at the people sitting in a circle around him. He said, “Here is my mother! Here are my brothers!"
Mark,3,35,Anyone who does what God wants is my brother or sister or mother.”
Mark,4,1,Again Jesus began to teach by the Sea of Galilee. The crowd that gathered around him was very large. So he got into a boat. He sat down in it out on the lake. All the people were along the shore at the water’s edge.
Mark,4,2,"He taught them many things using stories. In his teaching he said,"
Mark,4,3,“Listen! A farmer went out to plant his seed.
Mark,4,4,He scattered the seed on the ground. Some fell on a path. Birds came and ate it up.
Mark,4,5,"Some seed fell on rocky places, where there wasn’t much soil. The plants came up quickly, because the soil wasn’t deep."
Mark,4,6,"When the sun came up, it burned the plants. They dried up because they had no roots."
Mark,4,7,Other seed fell among thorns. The thorns grew up and crowded out the plants. So the plants did not bear grain.
Mark,4,8,"Still other seed fell on good soil. It grew up and produced a crop 30, 60, or even 100 times more than the farmer planted.”"
Mark,4,9,"Then Jesus said, “Whoever has ears should listen.”"
Mark,4,10,Later Jesus was alone. The 12 disciples asked him about the stories. So did the others around him.
Mark,4,11,"He told them, “The secret of God’s kingdom has been given to you. But to outsiders everything is told using stories."
Mark,4,12,"In that way, “ ‘They will see but never know what they are seeing. They will hear but never understand. Otherwise they might turn and be forgiven!’ ”( Isaiah 6:9, 10)"
Mark,4,13,"Then Jesus said to them, “Don’t you understand this story? Then how will you understand any stories of this kind?"
Mark,4,14,The seed the farmer plants is God’s message.
Mark,4,15,What is seed scattered on a path like? The message is planted. The people hear the message. Then Satan comes. He takes away the message that was planted in them.
Mark,4,16,And what is seed scattered on rocky places like? The people hear the message. At once they receive it with joy.
Mark,4,17,But they have no roots. So they last only a short time. They quickly fall away from the faith when trouble or suffering comes because of the message.
Mark,4,18,And what is seed scattered among thorns like? The people hear the message.
Mark,4,19,But then the worries of this life come to them. Wealth comes with its false promises. The people also long for other things. All of these are the kinds of things that crowd out the message. They keep it from producing fruit.
Mark,4,20,"And what is seed scattered on good soil like? The people hear the message. They accept it. They produce a good crop 30, 60, or even 100 times more than the farmer planted.”"
Mark,4,21,"Jesus said to them, “Do you bring in a lamp to put it under a large bowl or a bed? Don’t you put it on its stand?"
Mark,4,22,What is hidden is meant to be seen. And what is put out of sight is meant to be brought out into the open.
Mark,4,23,Whoever has ears should listen.”
Mark,4,24,"“Think carefully about what you hear,” he said. “As you give, so you will receive. In fact, you will receive even more."
Mark,4,25,"Whoever has something will be given more. Whoever has nothing, even what they have will be taken away from them.”"
Mark,4,26,"Jesus also said, “Here is what God’s kingdom is like. A farmer scatters seed on the ground."
Mark,4,27,Night and day the seed comes up and grows. It happens whether the farmer sleeps or gets up. He doesn’t know how it happens.
Mark,4,28,"All by itself the soil produces grain. First the stalk comes up. Then the head appears. Finally, the full grain appears in the head."
Mark,4,29,"Before long the grain ripens. So the farmer cuts it down, because the harvest is ready.”"
Mark,4,30,"Again Jesus said, “What can we say God’s kingdom is like? What story can we use to explain it?"
Mark,4,31,"It is like a mustard seed, which is the smallest of all seeds on earth."
Mark,4,32,"But when you plant the seed, it grows. It becomes the largest of all garden plants. Its branches are so big that birds can rest in its shade.”"
Mark,4,33,"Using many stories like these, Jesus spoke the word to them. He told them as much as they could understand."
Mark,4,34,"He did not say anything to them without using a story. But when he was alone with his disciples, he explained everything."
Mark,4,35,"When evening came, Jesus said to his disciples, “Let’s go over to the other side of the lake.”"
Mark,4,36,"They left the crowd behind. And they took him along in a boat, just as he was. There were also other boats with him."
Mark,4,37,A wild storm came up. Waves crashed over the boat. It was about to sink.
Mark,4,38,"Jesus was in the back, sleeping on a cushion. The disciples woke him up. They said, “Teacher! Don’t you care if we drown?”"
Mark,4,39,"He got up and ordered the wind to stop. He said to the waves, “Quiet! Be still!” Then the wind died down. And it was completely calm."
Mark,4,40,"He said to his disciples, “Why are you so afraid? Don’t you have any faith at all yet?”"
Mark,4,41,"They were terrified. They asked each other, “Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!”"
Mark,5,1,They went across the Sea of Galilee to the area of the Gerasenes.
Mark,5,2,Jesus got out of the boat. A man controlled by an evil spirit came from the tombs to meet him.
Mark,5,3,The man lived in the tombs. No one could keep him tied up anymore. Not even a chain could hold him.
Mark,5,4,His hands and feet had often been chained. But he tore the chains apart. And he broke the iron cuffs on his ankles. No one was strong enough to control him.
Mark,5,5,Night and day he screamed among the tombs and in the hills. He cut himself with stones.
Mark,5,6,"When he saw Jesus a long way off, he ran to him. He fell on his knees in front of him."
Mark,5,7,"He shouted at the top of his voice, “Jesus, Son of the Most High God, what do you want with me? Swear to God that you won’t hurt me!”"
Mark,5,8,"This was because Jesus had said to him, “Come out of this man, you evil spirit!”"
Mark,5,9,"Then Jesus asked the demon, “What is your name?” “My name is Legion,” he replied. “There are many of us.”"
Mark,5,10,And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area.
Mark,5,11,A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside.
Mark,5,12,"The demons begged Jesus, “Send us among the pigs. Let us go into them.”"
Mark,5,13,"Jesus allowed it. The evil spirits came out of the man and went into the pigs. There were about 2,000 pigs in the herd. The whole herd rushed down the steep bank. They ran into the lake and drowned."
Mark,5,14,Those who were tending the pigs ran off. They told the people in the town and countryside what had happened. The people went out to see for themselves.
Mark,5,15,Then they came to Jesus. They saw the man who had been controlled by many demons. He was sitting there. He was now dressed and thinking clearly. All this made the people afraid.
Mark,5,16,Those who had seen it told them what had happened to the man. They told about the pigs as well.
Mark,5,17,Then the people began to beg Jesus to leave their area.
Mark,5,18,Jesus was getting into the boat. The man who had been controlled by demons begged to go with him.
Mark,5,19,"Jesus did not let him. He said, “Go home to your own people. Tell them how much the Lord has done for you. Tell them how kind he has been to you.”"
Mark,5,20,"So the man went away. In the area known as the Ten Cities, he began to tell how much Jesus had done for him. And all the people were amazed."
Mark,5,21,Jesus went across the Sea of Galilee in a boat. It landed at the other side. There a large crowd gathered around him.
Mark,5,22,"Then a man named Jairus came. He was a synagogue leader. When he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet."
Mark,5,23,"He begged Jesus, “Please come. My little daughter is dying. Place your hands on her to heal her. Then she will live.”"
Mark,5,24,So Jesus went with him. A large group of people followed. They crowded around him.
Mark,5,25,A woman was there who had a sickness that made her bleed. It had lasted for 12 years.
Mark,5,26,"She had suffered a great deal, even though she had gone to many doctors. She had spent all the money she had. But she was getting worse, not better."
Mark,5,27,Then she heard about Jesus. She came up behind him in the crowd and touched his clothes.
Mark,5,28,"She thought, “I just need to touch his clothes. Then I will be healed.”"
Mark,5,29,Right away her bleeding stopped. She felt in her body that her suffering was over.
Mark,5,30,"At once Jesus knew that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd. He asked, “Who touched my clothes?”"
Mark,5,31,"“You see the people,” his disciples answered. “They are crowding against you. And you still ask, ‘Who touched me?’ ”"
Mark,5,32,But Jesus kept looking around. He wanted to see who had touched him.
Mark,5,33,Then the woman came and fell at his feet. She knew what had happened to her. She was shaking with fear. But she told him the whole truth.
Mark,5,34,"He said to her, “Dear woman, your faith has healed you. Go in peace. You are free from your suffering.”"
Mark,5,35,"While Jesus was still speaking, some people came from the house of Jairus. He was the synagogue leader. “Your daughter is dead,” they said. “Why bother the teacher anymore?”"
Mark,5,36,"Jesus heard what they were saying. He told the synagogue leader, “Don’t be afraid. Just believe.”"
Mark,5,37,"He let only Peter, James, and John, the brother of James, follow him."
Mark,5,38,They came to the home of the synagogue leader. There Jesus saw a lot of confusion. People were crying and sobbing loudly.
Mark,5,39,"He went inside. Then he said to them, “Why all this confusion and sobbing? The child is not dead. She is only sleeping.”"
Mark,5,40,But they laughed at him. He made them all go outside. He took only the child’s father and mother and the disciples who were with him. And he went in where the child was.
Mark,5,41,"He took her by the hand. Then he said to her, “ Talitha koum! ” This means, “Little girl, I say to you, get up!”"
Mark,5,42,The girl was 12 years old. Right away she stood up and began to walk around. They were totally amazed at this.
Mark,5,43,Jesus gave strict orders not to let anyone know what had happened. And he told them to give her something to eat.
Mark,6,1,Jesus left there and went to his hometown of Nazareth. His disciples went with him.
Mark,6,2,"When the Sabbath day came, he began to teach in the synagogue. Many who heard him were amazed. “Where did this man get these things?” they asked. “What’s this wisdom that has been given to him? What are these remarkable miracles he is doing?"
Mark,6,3,"Isn’t this the carpenter? Isn’t this Mary’s son? Isn’t this the brother of James, Joseph, Judas and Simon? Aren’t his sisters here with us?” They were not pleased with him at all."
Mark,6,4,"Jesus said to them, “A prophet is honored everywhere except in his own town. He doesn’t receive any honor among his relatives or in his own home.”"
Mark,6,5,Jesus placed his hands on a few sick people and healed them. But he could not do any other miracles there.
Mark,6,6,He was amazed because they had no faith. Jesus went around teaching from village to village.
Mark,6,7,He called the 12 disciples to him. Then he began to send them out two by two. He gave them authority to drive out evil spirits.
Mark,6,8,Here is what he told them to do. “Take only a walking stick for your trip. Do not take bread or a bag. Take no money in your belts.
Mark,6,9,Wear sandals. But do not take extra clothes.
Mark,6,10,"When you are invited into a house, stay there until you leave town."
Mark,6,11,"Some places may not welcome you or listen to you. If they don’t, leave that place and shake the dust off your feet. That will be a witness against the people living there.”"
Mark,6,12,They went out. And they preached that people should turn away from their sins.
Mark,6,13,They drove out many demons. They poured olive oil on many sick people and healed them.
Mark,6,14,"King Herod heard about this. Jesus’ name had become well known. Some were saying, “John the Baptist has been raised from the dead! That is why he has the power to do miracles.”"
Mark,6,15,"Others said, “He is Elijah.” Still others claimed, “He is a prophet. He is like one of the prophets of long ago.”"
Mark,6,16,"But when Herod heard this, he said, “I had John’s head cut off. And now he has been raised from the dead!”"
Mark,6,17,"In fact, it was Herod himself who had given orders to arrest John. He had him tied up and put in prison. He did this because of Herodias. She was the wife of Herod’s brother Philip. But now Herod was married to her."
Mark,6,18,"John had been saying to Herod, “It is against the Law for you to be married to your brother’s wife.”"
Mark,6,19,"Herodias couldn’t forgive John for saying that. She wanted to kill him. But she could not,"
Mark,6,20,"because Herod was afraid of John. So he kept John safe. Herod knew John was a holy man who did what was right. When Herod heard him, he was very puzzled. But he liked to listen to John."
Mark,6,21,Finally the right time came. Herod gave a banquet on his birthday. He invited his high officials and military leaders. He also invited the most important men in Galilee.
Mark,6,22,"Then the daughter of Herodias came in and danced. She pleased Herod and his dinner guests. The king said to the girl, “Ask me for anything you want. I’ll give it to you.”"
Mark,6,23,"And he gave her his promise. He said to her, “Anything you ask for I will give you. I’ll give you up to half my kingdom.”"
Mark,6,24,"She went out and said to her mother, “What should I ask for?” “The head of John the Baptist,” she answered."
Mark,6,25,"At once the girl hurried to ask the king. She said, “I want you to give me the head of John the Baptist on a big plate right now.”"
Mark,6,26,The king was very upset. But he thought about his promise and his dinner guests. So he did not want to say no to the girl.
Mark,6,27,He sent a man right away to bring John’s head. The man went to the prison and cut off John’s head.
Mark,6,28,"He brought it back on a big plate. He gave it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother."
Mark,6,29,John’s disciples heard about this. So they came and took his body. Then they placed it in a tomb.
Mark,6,30,The apostles gathered around Jesus. They told him all they had done and taught.
Mark,6,31,"But many people were coming and going. So they did not even have a chance to eat. Then Jesus said to his apostles, “Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place. You need to get some rest.”"
Mark,6,32,So they went away by themselves in a boat to a quiet place.
Mark,6,33,But many people who saw them leaving recognized them. They ran from all the towns and got there ahead of them.
Mark,6,34,"When Jesus came ashore, he saw a large crowd. He felt deep concern for them. They were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began teaching them many things."
Mark,6,35,"By that time it was late in the day. His disciples came to him. “There is nothing here,” they said. “It’s already very late."
Mark,6,36,Send the people away. Then they can go to the nearby countryside and villages to buy something to eat.”
Mark,6,37,"But Jesus answered, “You give them something to eat.” They said to him, “That would take more than half a year’s pay! Should we go and spend that much on bread? Are we supposed to feed them?”"
Mark,6,38,"“How many loaves do you have?” Jesus asked. “Go and see.” When they found out, they said, “Five loaves and two fish.”"
Mark,6,39,Then Jesus directed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass.
Mark,6,40,So they sat down in groups of 100s and 50s.
Mark,6,41,Jesus took the five loaves and the two fish. He looked up to heaven and gave thanks. He broke the loaves into pieces. Then he gave them to his disciples to pass around to the people. He also divided the two fish among them all.
Mark,6,42,All of them ate and were satisfied.
Mark,6,43,The disciples picked up 12 baskets of broken pieces of bread and fish.
Mark,6,44,"The number of men who had eaten was 5,000."
Mark,6,45,Right away Jesus made his disciples get into the boat. He had them go on ahead of him to Bethsaida. Then he sent the crowd away.
Mark,6,46,"After leaving them, he went up on a mountainside to pray."
Mark,6,47,"Later that night, the boat was in the middle of the Sea of Galilee. Jesus was alone on land."
Mark,6,48,"He saw the disciples pulling hard on the oars. The wind was blowing against them. Shortly before dawn, he went out to them. He walked on the lake. When he was about to pass by them,"
Mark,6,49,"they saw him walking on the lake. They thought he was a ghost, so they cried out."
Mark,6,50,"They all saw him and were terrified. Right away Jesus said to them, “Be brave! It is I. Don’t be afraid.”"
Mark,6,51,Then he climbed into the boat with them. The wind died down. And they were completely amazed.
Mark,6,52,They had not understood about the loaves. They were stubborn.
Mark,6,53,They went across the lake and landed at Gennesaret. There they tied up the boat.
Mark,6,54,"As soon as Jesus and his disciples got out, people recognized him."
Mark,6,55,They ran through that whole area to bring to him those who were sick. They carried them on mats to where they heard he was.
Mark,6,56,"He went into the villages, the towns and the countryside. Everywhere he went, the people brought the sick to the market areas. Those who were sick begged him to let them touch just the edge of his clothes. And all who touched his clothes were healed."
Mark,7,1,The Pharisees gathered around Jesus. So did some of the teachers of the law. All of them had come from Jerusalem.
Mark,7,2,They saw some of his disciples eating food with “unclean” hands. That means they were not washed.
Mark,7,3,The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands to make them “clean.” That’s what the elders teach.
Mark,7,4,"When they come from the market, they do not eat unless they wash. And they follow many other teachings. For example, they wash cups, pitchers, and kettles in a special way."
Mark,7,5,So the Pharisees and the teachers of the law questioned Jesus. “Why don’t your disciples live by what the elders teach?” they asked. “Why do they eat their food with ‘unclean’ hands?”
Mark,7,6,"He replied, “Isaiah was right. He prophesied about you people who pretend to be good. He said, “ ‘These people honor me by what they say. But their hearts are far away from me."
Mark,7,7,Their worship doesn’t mean anything to me. They teach nothing but human rules.’( Isaiah 29:13)
Mark,7,8,You have let go of God’s commands. And you are holding on to teachings that people have made up.”
Mark,7,9,"Jesus continued speaking, “You have a fine way of setting aside God’s commands! You do this so you can follow your own teachings."
Mark,7,10,"Moses said, ‘Honor your father and mother.’( Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16) He also said, ‘Anyone who asks for bad things to happen to their father or mother must be put to death.’( Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9)"
Mark,7,11,But you allow people to say that what might have been used to help their parents is Corban. Corban means A Gift Set Apart for God.
Mark,7,12,So you no longer let them do anything for their parents.
Mark,7,13,You make the word of God useless by putting your own teachings in its place. And you do many things like this.”
Mark,7,14,"Again Jesus called the crowd to him. He said, “Listen to me, everyone. Understand this."
Mark,8,1,"During those days another large crowd gathered. They had nothing to eat. So Jesus called for his disciples to come to him. He said,"
Mark,8,2,“I feel deep concern for these people. They have already been with me three days. They don’t have anything to eat.
Mark,8,3,"If I send them away hungry, they will become too weak on their way home. Some of them have come from far away.”"
Mark,8,4,"His disciples answered him. “There is nothing here,” they said. “Where can anyone get enough bread to feed them?”"
Mark,8,5,"“How many loaves do you have?” Jesus asked. “Seven,” they replied."
Mark,8,6,He told the crowd to sit down on the ground. He took the seven loaves and gave thanks to God. Then he broke them and gave them to his disciples. They passed the pieces of bread around to the people.
Mark,8,7,The disciples also had a few small fish. Jesus gave thanks for them too. He told the disciples to pass them around.
Mark,8,8,"The people ate and were satisfied. After that, the disciples picked up seven baskets of leftover pieces."
Mark,8,9,"About 4,000 people were there. After Jesus sent them away,"
Mark,8,10,he got into a boat with his disciples. He went to the area of Dalmanutha.
Mark,8,11,The Pharisees came and began to ask Jesus questions. They wanted to test him. So they asked him for a sign from heaven.
Mark,8,12,"He sighed deeply. He said, “Why do you people ask for a sign? What I’m about to tell you is true. No sign will be given to you.”"
Mark,8,13,Then he left them. He got back into the boat and crossed to the other side of the lake.
Mark,8,14,The disciples had forgotten to bring bread. They had only one loaf with them in the boat.
Mark,8,15,"“Be careful,” Jesus warned them. “Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees. And watch out for the yeast of Herod.”"
Mark,8,16,"They talked about this with each other. They said, “He must be saying this because we don’t have any bread.”"
Mark,8,17,"Jesus knew what they were saying. So he asked them, “Why are you talking about having no bread? Why can’t you see or understand? Are you stubborn?"
Mark,8,18,Do you have eyes and still don’t see? Do you have ears and still don’t hear? And don’t you remember?
Mark,8,19,"Earlier I broke five loaves for the 5,000. How many baskets of pieces did you pick up?” “Twelve,” they replied."
Mark,8,20,"“Later I broke seven loaves for the 4,000. How many baskets of pieces did you pick up?” “Seven,” they answered."
Mark,8,21,"He said to them, “Can’t you understand yet?”"
Mark,8,22,Jesus and his disciples came to Bethsaida. Some people brought a blind man to him. They begged Jesus to touch him.
Mark,8,23,He took the blind man by the hand. Then he led him outside the village. He spit on the man’s eyes and placed his hands on him. “Do you see anything?” Jesus asked.
Mark,8,24,"The man looked up. He said, “I see people. They look like trees walking around.”"
Mark,8,25,Once more Jesus put his hands on the man’s eyes. Then his eyes were opened so that he could see again. He saw everything clearly.
Mark,8,26,"Jesus sent him home. He told him, “Don’t even go into the village.”"
Mark,8,27,"Jesus and his disciples went on to the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked them, “Who do people say I am?”"
Mark,8,28,"They replied, “Some say John the Baptist. Others say Elijah. Still others say one of the prophets.”"
Mark,8,29,"“But what about you?” he asked. “Who do you say I am?” Peter answered, “You are the Messiah.”"
Mark,8,30,Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him.
Mark,8,31,Jesus then began to teach his disciples. He taught them that the Son of Man must suffer many things. He taught them that the elders would not accept him. The chief priests and the teachers of the law would not accept him either. He must be killed and after three days rise again.
Mark,8,32,He spoke clearly about this. Peter took Jesus to one side and began to scold him.
Mark,8,33,"Jesus turned and looked at his disciples. He scolded Peter. “Get behind me, Satan!” he said. “You are not thinking about the things God cares about. Instead, you are thinking only about the things humans care about.”"
Mark,8,34,"Jesus called the crowd to him along with his disciples. He said, “Whoever wants to be my disciple must say no to themselves. They must pick up their cross and follow me."
Mark,8,35,Whoever wants to save their life will lose it. But whoever loses their life for me and for the good news will save it.
Mark,8,36,What good is it if someone gains the whole world but loses their soul?
Mark,8,37,Or what can anyone trade for their soul?
Mark,8,38,Suppose anyone is ashamed of me and my words among these adulterous and sinful people. Then the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes in his Father’s glory with the holy angels.”
Mark,9,1,"Jesus said to them, “What I’m about to tell you is true. Some who are standing here will not die before they see that God’s kingdom has come with power.”"
Mark,9,2,"After six days Jesus took Peter, James and John with him. He led them up a high mountain. They were all alone. There in front of them his appearance was changed."
Mark,9,3,His clothes became so white they shone. They were whiter than anyone in the world could bleach them.
Mark,9,4,Elijah and Moses appeared in front of Jesus and his disciples. The two of them were talking with Jesus.
Mark,9,5,"Peter said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters. One will be for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”"
Mark,9,6,"Peter didn’t really know what to say, because they were so afraid."
Mark,9,7,"Then a cloud appeared and covered them. A voice came from the cloud. It said, “This is my Son, and I love him. Listen to him!”"
Mark,9,8,They looked around. Suddenly they no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus.
Mark,9,9,"They came down the mountain. On the way down, Jesus ordered them not to tell anyone what they had seen. He told them to wait until the Son of Man had risen from the dead."
Mark,9,10,So they kept the matter to themselves. But they asked each other what “rising from the dead” meant.
Mark,9,11,"Then they asked Jesus, “Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah has to come first?”"
Mark,9,12,"Jesus replied, “That’s right. Elijah does come first. He makes all things new again. So why is it written that the Son of Man must suffer much and not be accepted?"
Mark,9,13,"I tell you, Elijah has come. They have done to him everything they wanted to do. They did it just as it is written about him.”"
Mark,9,14,"When Jesus and those who were with him came to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them. The teachers of the law were arguing with them."
Mark,9,15,"When all the people saw Jesus, they were filled with wonder. And they ran to greet him."
Mark,9,16,“What are you arguing with them about?” Jesus asked.
Mark,9,17,"A man in the crowd answered. “Teacher,” he said, “I brought you my son. He is controlled by an evil spirit. Because of this, my son can’t speak anymore."
Mark,9,18,"When the spirit takes hold of him, it throws him to the ground. He foams at the mouth. He grinds his teeth. And his body becomes stiff. I asked your disciples to drive out the spirit. But they couldn’t do it.”"
Mark,9,19,“You unbelieving people!” Jesus replied. “How long do I have to stay with you? How long do I have to put up with you? Bring the boy to me.”
Mark,9,20,"So they brought him. As soon as the spirit saw Jesus, it threw the boy into a fit. He fell to the ground. He rolled around and foamed at the mouth."
Mark,9,21,"Jesus asked the boy’s father, “How long has he been like this?” “Since he was a child,” he answered."
Mark,9,22,"“The spirit has often thrown him into fire or water to kill him. But if you can do anything, take pity on us. Please help us.”"
Mark,9,23,“ ‘If you can’?” said Jesus. “Everything is possible for the one who believes.”
Mark,9,24,"Right away the boy’s father cried out, “I do believe! Help me overcome my unbelief!”"
Mark,9,25,"Jesus saw that a crowd was running over to see what was happening. Then he ordered the evil spirit to leave the boy. “You spirit that makes him unable to hear and speak!” he said. “I command you, come out of him. Never enter him again.”"
Mark,9,26,"The spirit screamed. It shook the boy wildly. Then it came out of him. The boy looked so lifeless that many people said, “He’s dead.”"
Mark,9,27,"But Jesus took him by the hand. He lifted the boy to his feet, and the boy stood up."
Mark,9,28,"Jesus went indoors. Then his disciples asked him in private, “Why couldn’t we drive out the evil spirit?”"
Mark,9,29,"He replied, “This kind can come out only by prayer.”"
Mark,9,30,They left that place and passed through Galilee. Jesus did not want anyone to know where they were.
Mark,9,31,"That was because he was teaching his disciples. He said to them, “The Son of Man is going to be handed over to men. They will kill him. After three days he will rise from the dead.”"
Mark,9,32,But they didn’t understand what he meant. And they were afraid to ask him about it.
Mark,9,33,"Jesus and his disciples came to a house in Capernaum. There he asked them, “What were you arguing about on the road?”"
Mark,9,34,"But they kept quiet. On the way, they had argued about which one of them was the most important person."
Mark,9,35,"Jesus sat down and called for the 12 disciples to come to him. Then he said, “Anyone who wants to be first must be the very last. They must be the servant of everyone.”"
Mark,9,36,"Jesus took a little child and had the child stand among them. Then he took the child in his arms. He said to them,"
Mark,9,37,“Anyone who welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me. And anyone who welcomes me also welcomes the one who sent me.”
Mark,9,38,"“Teacher,” said John, “we saw someone driving out demons in your name. We told him to stop, because he was not one of us.”"
Mark,9,39,"“Do not stop him,” Jesus said. “For no one who does a miracle in my name can in the next moment say anything bad about me."
Mark,9,40,Anyone who is not against us is for us.
Mark,9,41,What I’m about to tell you is true. Suppose someone gives you a cup of water in my name because you belong to the Messiah. That person will certainly not go without a reward.
Mark,9,42,"“What if someone leads one of these little ones who believe in me to sin? If they do, it would be better if a large millstone were hung around their neck and they were thrown into the sea."
Mark,10,1,"Jesus left that place and went into the area of Judea and across the Jordan River. Again crowds of people came to him. As usual, he taught them."
Mark,10,2,"Some Pharisees came to test Jesus. They asked, “Does the Law allow a man to divorce his wife?”"
Mark,10,3,“What did Moses command you?” he replied.
Mark,10,4,"They said, “Moses allowed a man to write a letter of divorce and send her away.”"
Mark,10,5,"“You were stubborn. That’s why Moses wrote you this law,” Jesus replied."
Mark,10,6,"“But at the beginning of creation, God ‘made them male and female.’( Genesis 1:27)"
Mark,10,7,‘That’s why a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife.
Mark,10,8,"The two of them will become one.’( Genesis 2:24) They are no longer two, but one."
Mark,10,9,So no one should separate what God has joined together.”
Mark,10,10,"When they were in the house again, the disciples asked Jesus about this."
Mark,10,11,"He answered, “What if a man divorces his wife and gets married to another woman? He commits adultery against her."
Mark,10,12,And what if she divorces her husband and gets married to another man? She commits adultery.”
Mark,10,13,People were bringing little children to Jesus. They wanted him to place his hands on them to bless them. But the disciples told them to stop.
Mark,10,14,"When Jesus saw this, he was angry. He said to his disciples, “Let the little children come to me. Don’t keep them away. God’s kingdom belongs to people like them."
Mark,10,15,What I’m about to tell you is true. Anyone who will not receive God’s kingdom like a little child will never enter it.”
Mark,10,16,Then he took the children in his arms. He placed his hands on them to bless them.
Mark,10,17,"As Jesus started on his way, a man ran up to him. He fell on his knees before Jesus. “Good teacher,” he said, “what must I do to receive eternal life?”"
Mark,10,18,“Why do you call me good?” Jesus answered. “No one is good except God.
Mark,10,19,You know what the commandments say. ‘Do not murder. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not be a false witness. Do not cheat. Honor your father and mother.’ ”( Exodus 20:12–16; Deuteronomy 5:16–20)
Mark,10,20,"“Teacher,” he said, “I have obeyed all those commandments since I was a boy.”"
Mark,10,21,"Jesus looked at him and loved him. “You are missing one thing,” he said. “Go and sell everything you have. Give the money to those who are poor. You will have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me.”"
Mark,10,22,"The man’s face fell. He went away sad, because he was very rich."
Mark,10,23,"Jesus looked around. He said to his disciples, “How hard it is for rich people to enter God’s kingdom!”"
Mark,10,24,"The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, “Children, how hard it is to enter God’s kingdom!"
Mark,10,25,Is it hard for a camel to go through the eye of a needle? It is even harder for someone who is rich to enter God’s kingdom!”
Mark,10,26,"The disciples were even more amazed. They said to each other, “Then who can be saved?”"
Mark,10,27,"Jesus looked at them and said, “With people, this is impossible. But not with God. All things are possible with God.”"
Mark,10,28,"Then Peter spoke up, “We have left everything to follow you!”"
Mark,10,29,"“What I’m about to tell you is true,” Jesus replied. “Has anyone left home or family or fields for me and the good news?"
Mark,10,30,They will receive 100 times as much in this world. They will have homes and families and fields. But they will also be treated badly by others. In the world to come they will live forever.
Mark,10,31,But many who are first will be last. And the last will be first.”
Mark,10,32,They were on their way up to Jerusalem. Jesus was leading the way. The disciples were amazed. Those who followed were afraid. Again Jesus took the 12 disciples to one side. He told them what was going to happen to him.
Mark,10,33,"“We are going up to Jerusalem,” he said. “The Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will sentence him to death. Then they will hand him over to the Gentiles."
Mark,10,34,They will make fun of him and spit on him. They will whip him and kill him. Three days later he will rise from the dead!”
Mark,10,35,"James and John came to Jesus. They were the sons of Zebedee. “Teacher,” they said, “we would like to ask you for a favor.”"
Mark,10,36,“What do you want me to do for you?” he asked.
Mark,10,37,"They replied, “Let one of us sit at your right hand in your glorious kingdom. Let the other one sit at your left hand.”"
Mark,10,38,"“You don’t know what you’re asking for,” Jesus said. “Can you drink the cup of suffering I drink? Or can you go through the baptism of suffering I must go through?”"
Mark,10,39,"“We can,” they answered. Jesus said to them, “You will drink the cup I drink. And you will go through the baptism I go through."
Mark,10,40,But it is not for me to say who will sit at my right or left hand. These places belong to those they are prepared for.”
Mark,10,41,The other ten disciples heard about it. They became angry at James and John.
Mark,10,42,"Jesus called them together. He said, “You know about those who are rulers of the Gentiles. They hold power over their people. Their high officials order them around."
Mark,10,43,"Don’t be like that. Instead, anyone who wants to be important among you must be your servant."
Mark,10,44,And anyone who wants to be first must be the slave of everyone.
Mark,10,45,"Even the Son of Man did not come to be served. Instead, he came to serve others. He came to give his life as the price for setting many people free.”"
Mark,10,46,Jesus and his disciples came to Jericho. They were leaving the city. A large crowd was with them. A blind man was sitting by the side of the road begging. His name was Bartimaeus. Bartimaeus means Son of Timaeus.
Mark,10,47,"He heard that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by. So he began to shout, “Jesus! Son of David! Have mercy on me!”"
Mark,10,48,"Many people commanded him to stop. They told him to be quiet. But he shouted even louder, “Son of David! Have mercy on me!”"
Mark,10,49,"Jesus stopped and said, “Call for him.” So they called out to the blind man, “Cheer up! Get up on your feet! Jesus is calling for you.”"
Mark,10,50,He threw his coat to one side. Then he jumped to his feet and came to Jesus.
Mark,10,51,"“What do you want me to do for you?” Jesus asked him. The blind man said, “Rabbi, I want to be able to see.”"
Mark,10,52,"“Go,” said Jesus. “Your faith has healed you.” Right away he could see. And he followed Jesus along the road."
Mark,11,1,"As they all approached Jerusalem, they came to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives. Jesus sent out two of his disciples."
Mark,11,2,"He said to them, “Go to the village ahead of you. Just as you enter it, you will find a donkey’s colt tied there. No one has ever ridden it. Untie it and bring it here."
Mark,11,3,"Someone may ask you, ‘Why are you doing this?’ If so, say, ‘The Lord needs it. But he will send it back here soon.’ ”"
Mark,11,4,So they left. They found a colt out in the street. It was tied at a doorway. They untied it.
Mark,11,5,"Some people standing there asked, “What are you doing? Why are you untying that colt?”"
Mark,11,6,They answered as Jesus had told them to. So the people let them go.
Mark,11,7,They brought the colt to Jesus. They threw their coats over it. Then he sat on it.
Mark,11,8,Many people spread their coats on the road. Others spread branches they had cut in the fields.
Mark,11,9,"Those in front and those in back shouted, “Hosanna!” “Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!”( Psalm 118:25, 26)"
Mark,11,10,“Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David!” “Hosanna in the highest heaven!”
Mark,11,11,Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the temple courtyard. He looked around at everything. But it was already late. So he went out to Bethany with the 12 disciples.
Mark,11,12,"The next day as Jesus and his disciples were leaving Bethany, they were hungry."
Mark,11,13,"Not too far away, he saw a fig tree. It was covered with leaves. He went to find out if it had any fruit. When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves. It was not the season for figs."
Mark,11,14,"Then Jesus said to the tree, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again!” And his disciples heard him say it."
Mark,11,15,"When Jesus reached Jerusalem, he entered the temple courtyard. He began to drive out those who were buying and selling there. He turned over the tables of the people who were exchanging money. He also turned over the benches of those who were selling doves."
Mark,11,16,He would not allow anyone to carry items for sale through the temple courtyard.
Mark,11,17,"Then he taught them. He told them, “It is written that the Lord said, ‘My house will be called a house where people from all nations can pray.’( Isaiah 56:7) But you have made it a ‘den for robbers.’ ”( Jeremiah 7:11)"
Mark,11,18,"The chief priests and the teachers of the law heard about this. They began looking for a way to kill Jesus. They were afraid of him, because the whole crowd was amazed at his teaching."
Mark,11,19,"When evening came, Jesus and his disciples left the city."
Mark,11,20,"In the morning as Jesus and his disciples walked along, they saw the fig tree. It was dried up all the way down to the roots."
Mark,11,21,"Peter remembered. He said to Jesus, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree you put a curse on has dried up!”"
Mark,11,22,"“Have faith in God,” Jesus said."
Mark,11,23,"“What I’m about to tell you is true. Suppose someone says to this mountain, ‘Go and throw yourself into the sea.’ They must not doubt in their heart. They must believe that what they say will happen. Then it will be done for them."
Mark,11,24,"So I tell you, when you pray for something, believe that you have already received it. Then it will be yours."
Mark,12,1,"Jesus began to speak to the people using stories. He said, “A man planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it. He dug a pit for a winepress. He also built a lookout tower. He rented the vineyard out to some farmers. Then he went to another place."
Mark,12,2,At harvest time he sent a servant to the renters. He told the servant to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard.
Mark,12,3,But they grabbed the servant and beat him up. Then they sent him away with nothing.
Mark,12,4,So the man sent another servant to the renters. They hit this one on the head and treated him badly.
Mark,12,5,The man sent still another servant. The renters killed him. The man sent many others. The renters beat up some of them. They killed the others.
Mark,12,6,"“The man had one person left to send. It was his son, and he loved him. He sent him last of all. He said, ‘They will respect my son.’"
Mark,12,7,"“But the renters said to each other, ‘This is the one who will receive all the owner’s property someday. Come, let’s kill him. Then everything will be ours.’"
Mark,12,8,So they took him and killed him. They threw him out of the vineyard.
Mark,12,9,“What will the owner of the vineyard do then? He will come and kill those renters. He will give the vineyard to others.
Mark,12,10,"Haven’t you read what this part of Scripture says, “ ‘The stone the builders didn’t accept has become the most important stone of all."
Mark,12,11,"The Lord has done it. It is wonderful in our eyes’?”( Psalm 118:22, 23)"
Mark,12,12,"Then the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders looked for a way to arrest Jesus. They knew he had told the story against them. But they were afraid of the crowd. So they left him and went away."
Mark,12,13,Later the religious leaders sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Jesus. They wanted to trap him with his own words.
Mark,12,14,"They came to him and said, “Teacher, we know that you are a man of honor. You don’t let other people tell you what to do or say. You don’t care how important they are. But you teach the way of God truthfully. Is it right to pay the royal tax to Caesar or not?"
Mark,12,15,"Should we pay or shouldn’t we?” But Jesus knew what they were trying to do. So he asked, “Why are you trying to trap me? Bring me a silver coin. Let me look at it.”"
Mark,12,16,"They brought the coin. He asked them, “Whose picture is this? And whose words?” “Caesar’s,” they replied."
Mark,12,17,"Then Jesus said to them, “Give back to Caesar what belongs to Caesar. And give back to God what belongs to God.” They were amazed at him."
Mark,12,18,The Sadducees came to Jesus with a question. They do not believe that people rise from the dead.
Mark,12,19,"“Teacher,” they said, “Moses wrote for us about a man who died and didn’t have any children. But he did leave a wife behind. That man’s brother must get married to the widow. He must provide children to carry on his dead brother’s name."
Mark,12,20,There were seven brothers. The first one got married. He died without leaving any children.
Mark,12,21,The second one got married to the widow. He also died and left no child. It was the same with the third one.
Mark,12,22,"In fact, none of the seven left any children. Last of all, the woman died too."
Mark,12,23,"When the dead rise, whose wife will she be? All seven of them were married to her.”"
Mark,12,24,"Jesus replied, “You are mistaken because you do not know the Scriptures. And you do not know the power of God."
Mark,12,25,"When the dead rise, they won’t get married. And their parents won’t give them to be married. They will be like the angels in heaven."
Mark,12,26,"What about the dead rising? Haven’t you read in the Book of Moses the story of the burning bush? God said to Moses, ‘I am the God of Abraham. I am the God of Isaac. And I am the God of Jacob.’( Exodus 3:6)"
Mark,12,27,He is not the God of the dead. He is the God of the living. You have made a big mistake!”
Mark,12,28,"One of the teachers of the law came and heard the Sadducees arguing. He noticed that Jesus had given the Sadducees a good answer. So he asked him, “Which is the most important of all the commandments?”"
Mark,12,29,"Jesus answered, “Here is the most important one. Moses said, ‘Israel, listen to me. The Lord is our God. The Lord is one."
Mark,12,30,"Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul. Love him with all your mind and with all your strength.’( Deuteronomy 6:4, 5)"
Mark,12,31,And here is the second one. ‘Love your neighbor as you love yourself.’( Leviticus 19:18) There is no commandment more important than these.”
Mark,12,32,"“You have spoken well, teacher,” the man replied. “You are right in saying that God is one. There is no other God but him."
Mark,12,33,To love God with all your heart and mind and strength is very important. So is loving your neighbor as you love yourself. These things are more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.”
Mark,12,34,"Jesus saw that the man had answered wisely. He said to him, “You are not far from God’s kingdom.” From then on, no one dared to ask Jesus any more questions."
Mark,12,35,"Jesus was teaching in the temple courtyard. He asked, “Why do the teachers of the law say that the Messiah is the son of David?"
Mark,12,36,"The Holy Spirit spoke through David himself. David said, “ ‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your control.” ’( Psalm 110:1)"
Mark,12,37,David himself calls him ‘Lord.’ So how can he be David’s son?” The large crowd listened to Jesus with delight.
Mark,12,38,"As he taught, he said, “Watch out for the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in long robes. They like to be greeted with respect in the market."
Mark,12,39,They love to have the most important seats in the synagogues. They also love to have the places of honor at dinners.
Mark,12,40,They take over the houses of widows. They say long prayers to show off. God will punish these men very much.”
Mark,12,41,Jesus sat down across from the place where people put their temple offerings. He watched the crowd putting their money into the offering boxes. Many rich people threw large amounts into them.
Mark,12,42,But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins. They were worth only a few pennies.
Mark,12,43,"Jesus asked his disciples to come to him. He said, “What I’m about to tell you is true. That poor widow has put more into the offering box than all the others."
Mark,12,44,They all gave a lot because they are rich. But she gave even though she is poor. She put in everything she had. That was all she had to live on.”
Mark,13,1,"Jesus was leaving the temple. One of his disciples said to him, “Look, Teacher! What huge stones! What wonderful buildings!”"
Mark,13,2,“Do you see these huge buildings?” Jesus asked. “Not one stone here will be left on top of another. Every stone will be thrown down.”
Mark,13,3,"Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, across from the temple. Peter, James, John and Andrew asked him a question in private."
Mark,13,4,"“Tell us,” they said. “When will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are all about to come true?”"
Mark,13,5,"Jesus said to them, “Keep watch! Be careful that no one fools you."
Mark,13,6,"Many will come in my name. They will claim, ‘I am he.’ They will fool many people."
Mark,13,7,You will hear about wars. You will also hear people talking about future wars. Don’t be alarmed. These things must happen. But the end still isn’t here.
Mark,13,8,Nation will fight against nation. Kingdom will fight against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in many places. People will go hungry. All these things are the beginning of birth pains.
Mark,13,9,“Watch out! You will be handed over to the local courts. You will be whipped in the synagogues. You will stand in front of governors and kings because of me. In that way you will be witnesses to them.
Mark,13,10,The good news has to be preached to all nations before the end comes.
Mark,13,11,"You will be arrested and brought to trial. But don’t worry ahead of time about what you will say. Just say what God brings to your mind at the time. It is not you speaking, but the Holy Spirit."
Mark,13,12,“Brothers will hand over brothers to be killed. Fathers will hand over their children. Children will rise up against their parents and have them put to death.
Mark,13,13,Everyone will hate you because of me. But the one who remains strong in the faith will be saved.
Mark,13,14,“You will see ‘the hated thing that destroys.’( Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11) It will stand where it does not belong. The reader should understand this. Then those who are in Judea should escape to the mountains.
Mark,13,15,No one on the roof should go down into the house to take anything out.
Mark,13,16,No one in the field should go back to get their coat.
Mark,13,17,How awful it will be in those days for pregnant women! How awful for nursing mothers!
Mark,13,18,Pray that this will not happen in winter.
Mark,13,19,Those days will be worse than any others from the time God created the world until now. And there will never be any like them again.
Mark,13,20,"“If the Lord had not cut the time short, no one would live. But because of God’s chosen people, he has shortened it."
Mark,13,21,"At that time someone may say to you, ‘Look! Here is the Messiah!’ Or, ‘Look! There he is!’ Do not believe it."
Mark,13,22,False messiahs and false prophets will appear. They will do signs and miracles. They will try to fool God’s chosen people if possible.
Mark,13,23,Keep watch! I have told you everything ahead of time.
Mark,13,24,"“So in those days there will be terrible suffering. After that, Scripture says, “ ‘The sun will be darkened. The moon will not shine."
Mark,13,25,The stars will fall from the sky. The heavenly bodies will be shaken.’( Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)
Mark,13,26,“At that time people will see the Son of Man coming in clouds. He will come with great power and glory.
Mark,13,27,He will send his angels. He will gather his chosen people from all four directions. He will bring them from the ends of the earth to the ends of the heavens.
Mark,13,28,"“Learn a lesson from the fig tree. As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near."
Mark,13,29,"In the same way, when you see these things happening, you know that the end is near. It is right at the door."
Mark,13,30,What I’m about to tell you is true. The people living now will certainly not pass away until all those things have happened.
Mark,13,31,Heaven and earth will pass away. But my words will never pass away.
Mark,13,32,“But no one knows about that day or hour. Not even the angels in heaven know. The Son does not know. Only the Father knows.
Mark,13,33,Keep watch! Stay awake! You do not know when that time will come.
Mark,13,34,It’s like a man going away. He leaves his house and puts his servants in charge. Each one is given a task to do. He tells the one at the door to keep watch.
Mark,13,35,“So keep watch! You do not know when the owner of the house will come back. It may be in the evening or at midnight. It may be when the rooster crows or at dawn.
Mark,13,36,He may come suddenly. So do not let him find you sleeping.
Mark,13,37,"What I say to you, I say to everyone. ‘Watch!’ ”"
Mark,14,1,The Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread were only two days away. The chief priests and the teachers of the law were plotting to arrest Jesus secretly. They wanted to kill him.
Mark,14,2,"“But not during the feast,” they said. “The people may stir up trouble.”"
Mark,14,3,"Jesus was in Bethany. He was at the table in the home of Simon, who had a skin disease. A woman came with a special sealed jar. It contained very expensive perfume made out of pure nard. She broke the jar open and poured the perfume on Jesus’ head."
Mark,14,4,"Some of the people there became angry. They said to one another, “Why waste this perfume?"
Mark,14,5,It could have been sold for more than a year’s pay. The money could have been given to poor people.” So they found fault with the woman.
Mark,14,6,"“Leave her alone,” Jesus said. “Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing to me."
Mark,14,7,You will always have poor people with you. You can help them any time you want to. But you will not always have me.
Mark,14,8,She did what she could. She poured perfume on my body to prepare me to be buried.
Mark,14,9,What I’m about to tell you is true. What she has done will be told anywhere the good news is preached all over the world. It will be told in memory of her.”
Mark,14,10,Judas Iscariot was one of the 12 disciples. He went to the chief priests to hand Jesus over to them.
Mark,14,11,They were delighted to hear that he would do this. They promised to give Judas money. So he watched for the right time to hand Jesus over to them.
Mark,14,12,"It was the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread. That was the time to sacrifice the Passover lamb. Jesus’ disciples asked him, “Where do you want us to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover meal?”"
Mark,14,13,"So he sent out two of his disciples. He told them, “Go into the city. A man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him."
Mark,14,14,"He will enter a house. Say to its owner, ‘The Teacher asks, “Where is my guest room? Where can I eat the Passover meal with my disciples?” ’"
Mark,14,15,He will show you a large upstairs room. It will have furniture and will be ready. Prepare for us to eat there.”
Mark,14,16,The disciples left and went into the city. They found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover meal.
Mark,14,17,"When evening came, Jesus arrived with the 12 disciples."
Mark,14,18,"While they were at the table eating, Jesus said, “What I’m about to tell you is true. One of you who is eating with me will hand me over to my enemies.”"
Mark,14,19,"The disciples became sad. One by one they said to him, “Surely you don’t mean me?”"
Mark,14,20,"“It is one of you,” Jesus replied. “It is the one who dips bread into the bowl with me."
Mark,14,21,The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But how terrible it will be for the one who hands over the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.”
Mark,14,22,"While they were eating, Jesus took bread. He gave thanks and broke it. He handed it to his disciples and said, “Take it. This is my body.”"
Mark,14,23,Then he took a cup. He gave thanks and handed it to them. All of them drank from it.
Mark,14,24,"“This is my blood of the covenant,” he said to them. “It is poured out for many."
Mark,14,25,What I’m about to tell you is true. I won’t drink wine with you again until the day I drink it in God’s kingdom.”
Mark,14,26,Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives.
Mark,14,27,"“You will all turn away,” Jesus told the disciples. “It is written, “ ‘I will strike the shepherd down. Then the sheep will be scattered.’( Zechariah 13:7)"
Mark,14,28,"But after I rise from the dead, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.”"
Mark,14,29,"Peter said, “All the others may turn away. But I will not.”"
Mark,14,30,"“What I’m about to tell you is true,” Jesus answered. “It will happen today, in fact tonight. Before the rooster crows twice, you yourself will say three times that you don’t know me.”"
Mark,14,31,"But Peter would not give in. He said, “I may have to die with you. But I will never say I don’t know you.” And all the others said the same thing."
Mark,14,32,"Jesus and his disciples went to a place called Gethsemane. Jesus said to them, “Sit here while I pray.”"
Mark,14,33,"He took Peter, James and John along with him. He began to be very upset and troubled."
Mark,14,34,"“My soul is very sad. I feel close to death,” he said to them. “Stay here. Keep watch.”"
Mark,14,35,"He went a little farther. Then he fell to the ground. He prayed that, if possible, the hour might pass by him."
Mark,14,36,"“ Abba , Father,” he said, “everything is possible for you. Take this cup of suffering away from me. But let what you want be done, not what I want.”"
Mark,14,37,"Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. “Simon,” he said to Peter, “are you asleep? Couldn’t you keep watch for one hour?"
Mark,14,38,"Watch and pray. Then you won’t fall into sin when you are tempted. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak.”"
Mark,14,39,Once more Jesus went away and prayed the same thing.
Mark,14,40,Then he came back. Again he found them sleeping. They couldn’t keep their eyes open. They did not know what to say to him.
Mark,14,41,"Jesus returned the third time. He said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough! The hour has come. Look! The Son of Man is about to be handed over to sinners."
Mark,14,42,Get up! Let us go! Here comes the one who is handing me over to them!”
Mark,14,43,"Just as Jesus was speaking, Judas appeared. He was one of the 12 disciples. A crowd was with him. They were carrying swords and clubs. The chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders had sent them."
Mark,14,44,"Judas, who was going to hand Jesus over, had arranged a signal with them. “The one I kiss is the man,” he said. “Arrest him and have the guards lead him away.”"
Mark,14,45,"So Judas went to Jesus at once. Judas said, “Rabbi!” And he kissed Jesus."
Mark,14,46,The men grabbed Jesus and arrested him.
Mark,14,47,Then one of those standing nearby pulled his sword out. He struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear.
Mark,14,48,“Am I leading a band of armed men against you?” asked Jesus. “Do you have to come out with swords and clubs to capture me?
Mark,14,49,"Every day I was with you. I taught in the temple courtyard, and you didn’t arrest me. But the Scriptures must come true.”"
Mark,14,50,Then everyone left him and ran away.
Mark,14,51,"A young man was following Jesus. The man was wearing nothing but a piece of linen cloth. When the crowd grabbed him,"
Mark,14,52,he ran away naked. He left his clothing behind.
Mark,14,53,"The crowd took Jesus to the high priest. All the chief priests, the elders, and the teachers of the law came together."
Mark,14,54,"Not too far away, Peter followed Jesus. He went right into the courtyard of the high priest. There he sat with the guards. He warmed himself at the fire."
Mark,14,55,The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for something to use against Jesus. They wanted to put him to death. But they did not find any proof.
Mark,14,56,Many witnesses lied about him. But their stories did not agree.
Mark,14,57,Then some of them stood up. Here is what those false witnesses said about him.
Mark,14,58,"“We heard him say, ‘I will destroy this temple made by human hands. In three days I will build another temple, not made by human hands.’ ”"
Mark,14,59,But what they said did not agree.
Mark,14,60,"Then the high priest stood up in front of them. He asked Jesus, “Aren’t you going to answer? What are these charges these men are bringing against you?”"
Mark,14,61,"But Jesus remained silent. He gave no answer. Again the high priest asked him, “Are you the Messiah? Are you the Son of the Blessed One?”"
Mark,14,62,"“I am,” said Jesus. “And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One. You will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven.”"
Mark,14,63,The high priest tore his clothes. “Why do we need any more witnesses?” he asked.
Mark,14,64,“You have heard him say a very evil thing against God. What do you think?” They all found him guilty and said he must die.
Mark,14,65,"Then some began to spit at him. They blindfolded him. They hit him with their fists. They said, “Prophesy!” And the guards took him and beat him."
Mark,14,66,Peter was below in the courtyard. One of the high priest’s female servants came by.
Mark,14,67,"When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked closely at him. “You also were with Jesus, that Nazarene,” she said."
Mark,14,68,"But Peter said he had not been with him. “I don’t know or understand what you’re talking about,” he said. He went out to the entrance to the courtyard."
Mark,14,69,"The servant saw him there. She said again to those standing around, “This fellow is one of them.”"
Mark,14,70,"Again he said he was not. After a little while, those standing nearby said to Peter, “You must be one of them. You are from Galilee.”"
Mark,14,71,"Then Peter began to curse. He said to them, “I don’t know this man you’re talking about!”"
Mark,14,72,"Right away the rooster crowed the second time. Then Peter remembered what Jesus had spoken to him. “The rooster will crow twice,” he had said. “Before it does, you will say three times that you don’t know me.” Peter broke down and cried."
Mark,15,1,"It was very early in the morning. The chief priests, with the elders, the teachers of the law, and the whole Sanhedrin, made their plans. So they tied Jesus up and led him away. Then they handed him over to Pilate."
Mark,15,2,"“Are you the king of the Jews?” asked Pilate. “You have said so,” Jesus replied."
Mark,15,3,The chief priests brought many charges against him.
Mark,15,4,"So Pilate asked him again, “Aren’t you going to answer? See how many things they charge you with.”"
Mark,15,5,But Jesus still did not reply. Pilate was amazed.
Mark,15,6,It was the usual practice at the Passover Feast to let one prisoner go free. The people could choose the one they wanted.
Mark,15,7,A man named Barabbas was in prison. He was there with some other people who had fought against the country’s rulers. They had committed murder while they were fighting against the rulers.
Mark,15,8,The crowd came up and asked Pilate to do for them what he usually did.
Mark,15,9,“Do you want me to let the king of the Jews go free?” asked Pilate.
Mark,15,10,He knew that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him because they wanted to get their own way.
Mark,15,11,But the chief priests stirred up the crowd. So the crowd asked Pilate to let Barabbas go free instead.
Mark,15,12,“Then what should I do with the one you call the king of the Jews?” Pilate asked them.
Mark,15,13,“Crucify him!” the crowd shouted.
Mark,15,14,"“Why? What wrong has he done?” asked Pilate. But they shouted even louder, “Crucify him!”"
Mark,15,15,Pilate wanted to satisfy the crowd. So he let Barabbas go free. He ordered that Jesus be whipped. Then he handed him over to be nailed to a cross.
Mark,15,16,The soldiers led Jesus away into the palace. It was called the Praetorium. They called together the whole company of soldiers.
Mark,15,17,The soldiers put a purple robe on Jesus. Then they twisted thorns together to make a crown. They placed it on his head.
Mark,15,18,"They began to call out to him, “We honor you, king of the Jews!”"
Mark,15,19,Again and again they hit him on the head with a stick. They spit on him. They fell on their knees and pretended to honor him.
Mark,15,20,"After they had made fun of him, they took off the purple robe. They put his own clothes back on him. Then they led him out to nail him to a cross."
Mark,15,21,A man named Simon was passing by. He was from Cyrene. He was the father of Alexander and Rufus. Simon was on his way in from the country. The soldiers forced him to carry the cross.
Mark,15,22,They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha. The word Golgotha means the Place of the Skull.
Mark,15,23,Then they gave him wine mixed with spices. But he did not take it.
Mark,15,24,They nailed him to the cross. Then they divided up his clothes. They cast lots to see what each of them would get.
Mark,15,25,It was nine o’clock in the morning when they crucified him.
Mark,15,26,"They wrote out the charge against him. It read, The King of the Jews."
Mark,16,1,"The Sabbath day ended. Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices. They were going to use them for Jesus’ body."
Mark,16,2,"Very early on the first day of the week, they were on their way to the tomb. It was just after sunrise."
Mark,16,3,"They asked each other, “Who will roll the stone away from the entrance to the tomb?”"
Mark,16,4,Then they looked up and saw that the stone had been rolled away. The stone was very large.
Mark,16,5,"They entered the tomb. As they did, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe. He was sitting on the right side. They were alarmed."
Mark,16,6,"“Don’t be alarmed,” he said. “You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. But he has risen! He is not here! See the place where they had put him."
Mark,16,7,"Go! Tell his disciples and Peter, ‘He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him. It will be just as he told you.’ ”"
Mark,16,8,"The women were shaking and confused. They went out and ran away from the tomb. They said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid."
Mark,16,9,Jesus rose from the dead early on the first day of the week. He appeared first to Mary Magdalene. He had driven seven demons out of her.
Mark,16,10,She went and told those who had been with him. She found them crying. They were very sad.
Mark,16,11,They heard that Jesus was alive and that she had seen him. But they did not believe it.
Mark,16,12,"After that, Jesus appeared in a different form to two of them. This happened while they were walking out in the country."
Mark,16,13,The two returned and told the others about it. But the others did not believe them either.
Mark,16,14,Later Jesus appeared to the 11 disciples as they were eating. He spoke firmly to them because they had no faith. They would not believe those who had seen him after he rose from the dead.
Mark,16,15,"He said to them, “Go into all the world. Preach the good news to everyone."
Mark,16,16,Anyone who believes and is baptized will be saved. But anyone who does not believe will be punished.
Mark,16,17,Here are the miraculous signs that those who believe will do. In my name they will drive out demons. They will speak in languages they had not known before.
Mark,16,18,"They will pick up snakes with their hands. And when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all. They will place their hands on sick people. And the people will get well.”"
Mark,16,19,"When the Lord Jesus finished speaking to them, he was taken up into heaven. He sat down at the right hand of God."
Mark,16,20,Then the disciples went out and preached everywhere. The Lord worked with them. And he backed up his word by the signs that went with it.
