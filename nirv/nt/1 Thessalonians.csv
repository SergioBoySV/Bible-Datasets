1 Thessalonians,1,1,"I, Paul, am writing this letter. Silas and Timothy join me in writing. We are sending this letter to you, the members of the church in Thessalonica. You belong to God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. May grace and peace be given to you."
1 Thessalonians,1,2,We always thank God for all of you. We keep on praying for you.
1 Thessalonians,1,3,We remember you when we pray to our God and Father. Your work is produced by your faith. Your service is the result of your love. Your strength to continue comes from your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Thessalonians,1,4,"Brothers and sisters, you are loved by God. We know that he has chosen you."
1 Thessalonians,1,5,Our good news didn’t come to you only in words. It came with power. It came with the Holy Spirit’s help. He gave us complete faith in what we were preaching. You know how we lived among you for your good.
1 Thessalonians,1,6,We and the Lord were your examples. You followed us. You welcomed our message even when you were suffering terribly. You welcomed it with the joy the Holy Spirit gives.
1 Thessalonians,1,7,So you became a model to all the believers in the lands of Macedonia and Achaia.
1 Thessalonians,1,8,The Lord’s message rang out from you. That was true not only in Macedonia and Achaia. Your faith in God has also become known everywhere. So we don’t have to say anything about it.
1 Thessalonians,1,9,The believers themselves report the kind of welcome you gave us. They tell about how you turned away from statues of gods. And you turned to serve the living and true God.
1 Thessalonians,1,10,"They tell about how you are waiting for his Son to come from heaven. God raised him from the dead. He is Jesus. He saves us from God’s anger, and his anger is sure to come."
1 Thessalonians,2,1,"Brothers and sisters, you know that our visit to you produced results."
1 Thessalonians,2,2,"You know what happened earlier in the city of Philippi. We suffered, and people treated us very badly there. But God gave us the boldness to tell you his good news. We preached to you even when people strongly opposed us."
1 Thessalonians,2,3,The appeal we make is based on truth. It comes from a pure heart. We are not trying to trick you.
1 Thessalonians,2,4,"In fact, it is just the opposite. God has approved us to preach. He has trusted us with the good news. We aren’t trying to please people. We want to please God. He tests our hearts."
1 Thessalonians,2,5,"As you know, we never praised you if we didn’t mean it. We didn’t put on a mask to cover up any sinful desire. God is our witness that this is true."
1 Thessalonians,2,6,"We were not expecting people to praise us. We were not looking for praise from you or anyone else. Yet as Christ’s apostles, we could have used our authority over you."
1 Thessalonians,2,7,"Instead, we were like young children when we were with you. As a mother feeds and cares for her little children,"
1 Thessalonians,2,8,we cared for you. We loved you so much. So we were happy to share with you God’s good news. We were also happy to share our lives with you.
1 Thessalonians,2,9,"Brothers and sisters, I am sure you remember how hard we worked. We labored night and day while we preached to you God’s good news. We didn’t want to cause you any expense."
1 Thessalonians,2,10,You are witnesses of how we lived among you believers. God is also a witness that we were holy and godly and without blame.
1 Thessalonians,2,11,You know that we treated each of you as a father treats his own children.
1 Thessalonians,2,12,We gave you hope and strength. We comforted you. We really wanted you to live in a way that is worthy of God. He chooses you to enter his glorious kingdom.
1 Thessalonians,2,13,We never stop thanking God for the way you received his word. You heard it from us. But you didn’t accept it as a human word. You accepted it for what it really is. It is God’s word. It is really at work in you who believe.
1 Thessalonians,2,14,"Brothers and sisters, you became like the members of God’s churches in Judea. They are believers in Christ Jesus, just as you are. Your own people made you suffer. You went through the same things the church members in Judea suffered from the Jews."
1 Thessalonians,2,15,The Jews who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets also forced us to leave. They do not please God. They are enemies of everyone.
1 Thessalonians,2,16,"They try to keep us from speaking to the Gentiles. These Jews don’t want the Gentiles to be saved. In this way, these Jews always increase their sins to the limit. God’s anger has come on them at last."
1 Thessalonians,2,17,"Brothers and sisters, we were separated from you for a short time. Apart from you, we were like children without parents. We were no longer with you in person. But we kept you in our thoughts. We really wanted to see you. So we tried very hard to do so."
1 Thessalonians,2,18,"We wanted to come to you. Again and again I, Paul, wanted to come. But Satan blocked our way."
1 Thessalonians,2,19,"What is our hope? What is our joy? When our Lord Jesus returns, what is the crown we will delight in? Isn’t it you?"
1 Thessalonians,2,20,"Yes, you are our glory and our joy."
1 Thessalonians,3,1,We couldn’t wait any longer. So we thought it was best to be left by ourselves in Athens.
1 Thessalonians,3,2,We sent our brother Timothy to give you strength and hope in your faith. He works together with us in God’s service to spread the good news about Christ.
1 Thessalonians,3,3,We sent him so that no one would be upset by times of testing. You know very well that we have to go through times of testing.
1 Thessalonians,3,4,"In fact, when we were with you, here is what we kept telling you. We were telling you that our enemies would make us suffer. As you know very well, it has turned out that way."
1 Thessalonians,3,5,That’s the reason I sent someone to find out about your faith. I couldn’t wait any longer. I was afraid that Satan had tempted you in some way. Then our work among you would have been useless.
1 Thessalonians,3,6,"But Timothy has come to us from you just now. He has brought good news about your faith and love. He has told us that you always have happy memories of us. He has also said that you desire to see us, just as we desire to see you."
1 Thessalonians,3,7,"Brothers and sisters, in all our trouble and suffering your faith encouraged us."
1 Thessalonians,3,8,"Now we really live, because you are standing firm in the Lord."
1 Thessalonians,3,9,How can we thank God enough for you? We thank God because of all the joy we have in his presence. We have this joy because of you.
1 Thessalonians,3,10,Night and day we pray very hard that we will see you again. We want to give you what is missing in your faith.
1 Thessalonians,3,11,Now may a way be opened up for us to come to you. May our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus do this.
1 Thessalonians,3,12,May the Lord make your love grow. May it be like a rising flood. May your love for one another increase. May it also increase for everyone else. May it be just like our love for you.
1 Thessalonians,3,13,May the Lord give you strength in your hearts. Then you will be holy and without blame in the sight of our God and Father. May that be true when our Lord Jesus comes with all his holy ones.
1 Thessalonians,4,1,"Now I want to talk about some other matters, brothers and sisters. We taught you how to live in a way that pleases God. In fact, that is how you are living. In the name of the Lord Jesus we ask and beg you to do it more and more."
1 Thessalonians,4,2,You know the directions we gave you. They were given by the authority of the Lord Jesus.
1 Thessalonians,4,3,God wants you to be made holy. He wants you to stay away from sexual sins.
1 Thessalonians,4,4,He wants all of you to learn to control your own bodies. You must live in a way that is holy. You must live with honor.
1 Thessalonians,4,5,Don’t desire to commit sexual sins like people who don’t know God.
1 Thessalonians,4,6,None of you should sin against your brother or sister by doing that. You should not take advantage of your brother or sister. The Lord will punish everyone who commits these kinds of sins. We have already told you and warned you about this.
1 Thessalonians,4,7,That’s because God chose us to live pure lives. He wants us to be holy.
1 Thessalonians,4,8,Suppose someone refuses to accept our teaching. They are not turning their back on us. They are turning their back on God. This same God gives you his Holy Spirit.
1 Thessalonians,4,9,We don’t need to write to you about your love for one another. God himself has taught you to love one another.
1 Thessalonians,4,10,"In fact, you do love all God’s family all around Macedonia. Brothers and sisters, we are asking you to love one another more and more."
1 Thessalonians,4,11,"And do everything you can to live a quiet life. You should mind your own business. And work with your hands, just as we told you to."
1 Thessalonians,4,12,Then unbelievers will have respect for your everyday life. And you won’t have to depend on anyone.
1 Thessalonians,4,13,"Brothers and sisters, we want you to know what happens to those who die. We don’t want you to mourn, as other people do. They mourn because they don’t have any hope."
1 Thessalonians,4,14,"We believe that Jesus died and rose again. When he returns, many who believe in him will have died already. We believe that God will bring them back with Jesus."
1 Thessalonians,4,15,"This agrees with what the Lord has said. When the Lord comes, many of us will still be alive. We tell you that we will certainly not go up before those who have died."
1 Thessalonians,4,16,The Lord himself will come down from heaven. We will hear a loud command. We will hear the voice of the leader of the angels. We will hear a blast from God’s trumpet. Many who believe in Christ will have died already. They will rise first.
1 Thessalonians,4,17,"After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them. We will be taken up in the clouds. We will meet the Lord in the air. And we will be with him forever."
1 Thessalonians,4,18,So encourage one another with these words of comfort.
1 Thessalonians,5,1,"Brothers and sisters, we don’t have to write to you about times and dates."
1 Thessalonians,5,2,You know very well how the day of the Lord will come. It will come like a thief in the night.
1 Thessalonians,5,3,People will be saying that everything is peaceful and safe. Then suddenly they will be destroyed. It will happen like birth pains coming on a pregnant woman. None of the people will escape.
1 Thessalonians,5,4,"Brothers and sisters, you are not in darkness. So that day should not surprise you as a thief would."
1 Thessalonians,5,5,All of you are children of the light. You are children of the day. We don’t belong to the night. We don’t belong to the darkness.
1 Thessalonians,5,6,"So let us not be like the others. They are asleep. Instead, let us be wide awake and in full control of ourselves."
1 Thessalonians,5,7,"Those who sleep, sleep at night. Those who get drunk, get drunk at night."
1 Thessalonians,5,8,But we belong to the day. So let us control ourselves. Let us put on our chest the armor of faith and love. Let us put on the hope of salvation like a helmet.
1 Thessalonians,5,9,God didn’t choose us to receive his anger. He chose us to receive salvation because of what our Lord Jesus Christ has done.
1 Thessalonians,5,10,"Jesus died for us. Some will be alive when he comes. Others will be dead. Either way, we will live together with him."
1 Thessalonians,5,11,"So encourage one another with the hope you have. Build each other up. In fact, that’s what you are doing."
1 Thessalonians,5,12,"Brothers and sisters, we ask you to accept the godly leaders who work hard among you. They care for you in the Lord. They correct you."
1 Thessalonians,5,13,Have a lot of respect for them. Love them because of what they do. Live in peace with one another.
1 Thessalonians,5,14,"Brothers and sisters, we are asking you to warn certain people. These people don’t want to work. Instead, they make trouble. We are also asking you to encourage those who have lost hope. Help those who are weak. Be patient with everyone."
1 Thessalonians,5,15,"Make sure that no one pays back one wrong act with another. Instead, always try to do what is good for each other and for everyone else."
1 Thessalonians,5,16,Always be joyful.
1 Thessalonians,5,17,Never stop praying.
1 Thessalonians,5,18,Give thanks no matter what happens. God wants you to thank him because you believe in Christ Jesus.
1 Thessalonians,5,19,Don’t try to stop what the Holy Spirit is doing.
1 Thessalonians,5,20,Don’t treat prophecies as if they weren’t important.
1 Thessalonians,5,21,But test all prophecies. Hold on to what is good.
1 Thessalonians,5,22,Say no to every kind of evil.
1 Thessalonians,5,23,"God is the God who gives peace. May he make you holy through and through. May your whole spirit, soul and body be kept free from blame. May you be without blame from now until our Lord Jesus Christ comes."
1 Thessalonians,5,24,The God who has chosen you is faithful. He will do all these things.
1 Thessalonians,5,25,"Brothers and sisters, pray for us."
1 Thessalonians,5,26,Greet all God’s people with a holy kiss.
1 Thessalonians,5,27,"While the Lord is watching, here is what I command you. Have this letter read to all the brothers and sisters."
1 Thessalonians,5,28,May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
