Nehemiah,1,1,"The words of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah:
N ow it happened in the month of Chislev, in the twentieth year [of the Persian king], as I was in the capitol of Susa"
Nehemiah,1,2,"Hanani, one of my brothers, and some men from Judah came; and I asked them about the surviving Jews who had escaped and survived the captivity, and about Jerusalem."
Nehemiah,1,3,"They said to me, “The remnant there in the province who survived the captivity are in great distress and reproach; the wall of Jerusalem is broken down and its [fortified] gates have been burned (destroyed) by fire.”"
Nehemiah,1,4,"Now it came about when I heard these words, I sat down and wept and mourned for days; and I was fasting and praying [constantly] before the God of heaven."
Nehemiah,1,5,"And I said, “Please, O LORD God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who keeps the covenant and lovingkindness for those who love Him and keep His commandments"
Nehemiah,1,6,"please let Your ear be attentive and Your eyes open to hear the prayer of Your servant which I am praying before You, day and night, on behalf of Your servants, the sons (descendants) of Israel (Jacob), confessing the sins of the sons of Israel which we have committed against You; I and my father’s house have sinned."
Nehemiah,1,7,"We have acted very corruptly against You and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances which You commanded Your servant Moses. [Deut 6:1-9]"
Nehemiah,1,8,"Please remember the word which You commanded Your servant Moses, saying, ‘If you are unfaithful and violate your obligations to Me I will scatter you [abroad] among the peoples; [Lev 26:33]"
Nehemiah,1,9,"but if you return to Me and keep My commandments and do them, though those of you who have been scattered are in the most remote part of the heavens, I will gather them from there and will bring them to the place where I have chosen for My Name to dwell.’ [Deut 30:1-5]"
Nehemiah,1,10,Now they are Your servants and Your people whom You have redeemed by Your great power and by Your strong hand.
Nehemiah,1,11,"Please, O Lord, let Your ear be attentive to the prayer of Your servant and the prayer of Your servants who delight to [reverently] fear Your Name [Your essence, Your nature, Your attributes, with awe]; and make Your servant successful this day and grant him compassion in the sight of this man [the king].”
F or I was cupbearer to the king [of Persia]."
Nehemiah,2,1,"In the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was placed before him, I took the wine and gave it to the king. Now I had not [previously] been sad in his presence."
Nehemiah,2,2,"So the king said to me, “Why do you look sad when you are not sick? This is nothing but sadness of heart.” Then I was very frightened"
Nehemiah,2,3,"and I said to the king, “Let the king live forever. Why should my face not be sad when the city, the place of my fathers’ tombs, lies desolate and its gates have been consumed by fire?”"
Nehemiah,2,4,"The king said to me, “What do you request?” So I prayed to the God of heaven."
Nehemiah,2,5,"I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor in your presence, [I ask] that you send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers’ tombs, so that I may rebuild it.”"
Nehemiah,2,6,"The king, beside whom the queen was sitting, asked me, “How long will your journey take, and when will you return?” So it pleased the king to send me, and I gave him a definite time [for my return]."
Nehemiah,2,7,"Then I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, let letters be given to me for the governors of the provinces beyond the [Euphrates] River, so that they will allow me to pass through until I reach Judah"
Nehemiah,2,8,"and a letter to Asaph, the keeper of the king’s forest, so that he will give me timber to construct beams for the gates of the fortress which is by the temple, and for the city wall and for the house which I will occupy.” And the king granted me what I asked, for the good hand of my God was upon me."
Nehemiah,2,9,Then I came to the governors of the provinces beyond the [Euphrates] River and gave them the king’s letters. Now the king had sent officers of the army and horsemen with me.
Nehemiah,2,10,"When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard this, it caused them great displeasure that someone had come to see about the welfare and prosperity of the Israelites."
Nehemiah,2,11,So I came to Jerusalem and was there for three days.
Nehemiah,2,12,"Then I got up in the night, I and a few men with me. I did not tell anyone what my God was putting in my heart to do for Jerusalem, and there was no animal with me except the one on which I was riding [so as not to attract attention]."
Nehemiah,2,13,So I went out at night by the Valley Gate toward the Dragon’s Well and to the Refuse Gate and inspected the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down and its gates which were consumed by fire.
Nehemiah,2,14,"Then I passed over to the Fountain Gate and to the King’s Pool, but there was no place for the animal that I was riding to pass."
Nehemiah,2,15,"So I went up at night by the ravine [of Kidron] and inspected the wall; then I turned back and entered [the city] by the Valley Gate, and returned."
Nehemiah,2,16,"The officials did not know where I had gone or what I had done; nor had I yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the officials, or the rest who did the work."
Nehemiah,2,17,"Then I said to them, “You see the bad situation that we are in—how Jerusalem is desolate and lies in ruins and its gates have been burned with fire. Come, and let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem, so that we will no longer be a disgrace.”"
Nehemiah,2,18,"Then I told them how the hand of my God had been favorable to me and also about the words that the king had spoken to me. And they said, “Let us rise up and build.” So they thoroughly supported the good work."
Nehemiah,2,19,"But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official and Geshem the Arab heard about it, they mocked us and regarded us with contempt and said, “What is this thing you are doing? Are you rebelling against the king?”"
Nehemiah,2,20,"I answered them, “The God of heaven [has appointed us for His purpose and] will give us success; therefore we His servants will arise and build, but you have no portion, right, or memorial in Jerusalem.”"
Nehemiah,3,1,"Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brothers the priests and built the Sheep Gate. They consecrated it and set up its doors; and they consecrated the wall [westward] to the Tower of the Hundred, as far as the Tower of Hananel."
Nehemiah,3,2,"Next to Eliashib the men of Jericho built, and next to them Zaccur the son of Imri built."
Nehemiah,3,3,Now the sons of Hassenaah built the Fish Gate; they laid its beams and set up its doors with its bolts and its bars.

Nehemiah,3,26,"The temple servants were living in Ophel [the hill south of the temple], and they made repairs as far as the front of the Water Gate on the east and the projecting tower."

Nehemiah,3,32,Between the upper room of the corner and the Sheep Gate the goldsmiths and merchants carried out repairs.
Nehemiah,4,1,"But when Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, he became furious, completely enraged, and he ridiculed the Jews."
Nehemiah,4,2,"He spoke before his brothers and the army of Samaria, “What are these feeble Jews doing? Can they restore it for themselves? Can they offer sacrifices? Can they finish in a day? Can they revive the stones from the heaps of dust and rubbish, even the ones that have been burned?”"
Nehemiah,4,3,"Now Tobiah the Ammonite was beside him, and he said, “Even what they are building—if a fox should get up on it, he would break down their stone wall.”"
Nehemiah,4,4,"[And Nehemiah prayed] Hear, O our God, how we are despised! Return their taunts on their own heads. Give them up as prey in a land of captivity."
Nehemiah,4,5,"Do not forgive their wrongdoing and do not let their sin be wiped out before You, for they have offended the builders [and provoked You]."
Nehemiah,4,6,"So we built the wall and the entire wall was joined together to half its height, for the people had a heart to work."
Nehemiah,4,7,"But when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the repair of the walls of Jerusalem went on, and that the breaches were being closed, they were very angry."
Nehemiah,4,8,"They all conspired together to come and to fight against Jerusalem, and to cause a disturbance in it."
Nehemiah,4,9,"But we prayed to our God, and because of them we set up a guard against them day and night."
Nehemiah,4,10,"Then [the leaders of] Judah said,
“The strength of the burden bearers is failing,
And there is much rubble;
We ourselves are unable
To rebuild the wall.”"
Nehemiah,4,11,"Our enemies said, “They will not know or see us until we are among them, kill them and put a stop to the work.”"
Nehemiah,4,12,"When the Jews who lived near them came, they said to us ten times (repeatedly), “From every place you turn, they will come up against us.”"
Nehemiah,4,13,"So I stationed armed men behind the wall in the lowest places, at the open positions [where it was least protected]; and I stationed the people in families with their swords, spears, and bows."
Nehemiah,4,14,"When I saw their fear, I stood and said to the nobles and officials and the rest of the people: “Do not be afraid of them; [confidently] remember the Lord who is great and awesome, and [with courage from Him] fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and for your homes.”"
Nehemiah,4,15,"Now when our enemies heard that we knew about their plot against us, and that God had frustrated their plan, we all returned to the wall, each one to his work."
Nehemiah,4,16,"From that day on, half of my servants carried on the work while the other half held the spears, shields, bows, and breastplates; and the captains were behind the whole house of Judah."
Nehemiah,4,17,Those who were rebuilding the wall and those who carried burdens loaded themselves so that everyone worked with one hand and held a weapon with the other.
Nehemiah,4,18,Every builder had his sword secured at his side as he built. And the one who sounded the trumpet [to summon the troops] stood at my side.
Nehemiah,4,19,"I said to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, “The work is great and extensive, and we are separated on the wall, far from one another."
Nehemiah,4,20,"Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, gather to us there. Our God will fight for us.”"
Nehemiah,4,21,So we carried on with the work with half of them holding spears from dawn until the stars came out.
Nehemiah,4,22,"At that time I also said to the people, “Let each man with his servant spend the night inside Jerusalem so that they may serve as a guard for us at night and a laborer during the day.”"
Nehemiah,4,23,"So neither I, my brothers (relatives), my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us took off our clothes; each took his weapon [even] to the water."
Nehemiah,5,1,Now there was a great outcry of the [poorer] people and their wives against their Jewish brothers [to whom they were deeply in debt].
Nehemiah,5,2,"For there were some who were saying, “We, along with our sons and our daughters, are many; therefore allow us to get grain, so that we may eat and survive.”"
Nehemiah,5,3,"There were others who were saying, “We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards, and our houses to buy grain because of the famine.”"
Nehemiah,5,4,"There were also others who were saying, “We have borrowed money on our fields and vineyards for the [Persian] king’s [heavy] tax."
Nehemiah,5,5,"Now our flesh (skin) is the same as that of our brothers (relatives), and our children are like their children, yet here we are forcing (selling) our sons and our daughters to be slaves; and some of our daughters are forced into bondage already, and we are powerless [to redeem them] because our fields and vineyards belong to others.”"
Nehemiah,5,6,Then I was very angry when I heard their outcry and these words [of accusation].
Nehemiah,5,7,"I thought it over and then challenged the nobles and the rulers. I said to them, “You are exacting usury (excessive interest) from your own brother (relative).” So I held a great assembly to confront them."
Nehemiah,5,8,"I said to them, “According to our ability we have redeemed (purchased back) our Jewish brothers who were sold to the [Gentile] nations; now would you even sell your brothers, that they might be sold to us?” Then they were silent and could not find a [single] word to say."
Nehemiah,5,9,"So I said, “What you are doing is not good. Should you not walk in the fear of our God to prevent the taunting by the [pagan] nations, our enemies?"
Nehemiah,5,10,"And likewise I, my brothers, and my servants are lending them money and grain. Please, let us stop [charging] this interest. [Ex 22:25]"
Nehemiah,5,11,"Please, give back to them this very day their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses, and also a hundredth part of the money, the grain, the new wine, and the oil that you are lending them.”"
Nehemiah,5,12,"Then they said, “We will give it back and not require anything from them. We will do exactly as you say.” Then I called the priests and took an oath from them that they would act in accordance with this promise."
Nehemiah,5,13,"I also shook out the front of my garment and said, “So may God shake out every man from his house and from his possessions who does not keep this promise; like this may he be shaken out and emptied.” And all the assembly said, “Amen!” And they praised the LORD. Then the people acted in accordance with this promise."
Nehemiah,5,14,"Moreover, from the day that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year to the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes, for twelve years, neither I nor my relatives have eaten the governor’s food allowance."
Nehemiah,5,15,But the former governors who were [in office] before me put heavy burdens on the people and took food and wine from them in addition to forty shekels of silver [as an excessive monthly salary]; even their servants assumed authority over the people. But I did not do so because of the [reverent] fear of God.
Nehemiah,5,16,"I also applied myself to the work on this wall; we did not buy any land, and all my servants were gathered together there for the work."
Nehemiah,5,17,"Moreover, there were at my table a hundred and fifty Jews and officials, besides those who came to us from the nations that were around us."
Nehemiah,5,18,"Now the following were prepared for each day: one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls (poultry) were prepared for me; and in intervals of ten days all sorts of wine was provided in abundance. Yet for all this, I did not demand the governor’s food allowance, because the servitude was heavy on this people."
Nehemiah,5,19,"Remember me, O my God, for good, according to all I have done for this people. [Heb 6:10]"
Nehemiah,6,1,"Now when Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of our enemies heard that I had rebuilt the wall, and that there was no breach left in it, although at that time I had not set up doors in the gates"
Nehemiah,6,2,"Sanballat and Geshem sent word to me, saying, “Come, let us meet together at Chephirim in the plain of Ono.” But they were planning to harm me."
Nehemiah,6,3,"So I sent messengers to them, saying, “I am doing a great work and cannot come down. Why should the work stop while I leave to come down to [meet with] you?”"
Nehemiah,6,4,"They sent word to me four times in this way, and I answered them in the same way."
Nehemiah,6,5,"Then Sanballat sent his servant to me in the same way the fifth time, with an open letter in his hand."
Nehemiah,6,6,"In it was written, “It is reported among the [neighboring] nations, and Gashmu is saying that you and the Jews are planning to revolt, and that is the reason you are rebuilding the wall. And according to these reports, you are to be their king."
Nehemiah,6,7,"Also [it is reported that] you have appointed prophets to make a proclamation concerning you in Jerusalem, saying, ‘There is a king in Judah!’ And now these things will be reported to the [Persian] king. So come now, and let us consult together.”"
Nehemiah,6,8,"I sent a message to him, saying, “Such things as you are saying have not been done; you are inventing them in your own mind.”"
Nehemiah,6,9,"For they all wanted to frighten us, thinking, “They will become discouraged with the work and it will not be done.” But now, [O God,] strengthen my hands."
Nehemiah,6,10,"When I went into the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who was confined at home, he said, “Let us meet [and take refuge] together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple, because they are coming to kill you, and they are coming to kill you at night.”"
Nehemiah,6,11,"But I said, “Should a man like me flee [in fear and hide]? Should someone like me enter the temple [for sanctuary] to save his life? I will not go.”"
Nehemiah,6,12,"Then I realized that God had not sent him, but he spoke this prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him."
Nehemiah,6,13,"He was hired for this reason, that I would be frightened and do as he said and sin, so that they would have [grounds to make] a malicious report in order to censure and disgrace me."
Nehemiah,6,14,"Remember, O My God, Tobiah and Sanballat in regard to these actions of theirs, and also [remember] the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who were trying to frighten me."
Nehemiah,6,15,"So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth [day] of [the month] Elul, in fifty-two days."
Nehemiah,6,16,"When all our enemies heard about it, and all the [Gentile] nations around us saw it, they lost their confidence; for they recognized that this work had been accomplished with the help of our God."
Nehemiah,6,17,"Moreover, in those days many letters went from the nobles of Judah to Tobiah, and Tobiah’s letters came to them."
Nehemiah,6,18,"For many in Judah were bound by oath to him because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah."
Nehemiah,6,19,"Also, they were speaking about Tobiah’s good deeds in my presence, and reporting to him what I said. Then Tobiah sent letters to frighten me."
Nehemiah,7,1,"Now when the wall had been rebuilt and I had set up the doors, and the gatekeepers, singers, and Levites had been appointed"
Nehemiah,7,2,"I put my brother Hanani, with Hananiah the commander of the fortress, in charge of Jerusalem, for Hananiah was a more faithful and God-fearing man than many [of the others]."
Nehemiah,7,3,"I said to them, “Do not let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot; and while the watchmen are still standing guard, have them shut and bar the doors. Appoint guards from the residents of Jerusalem, each at his post [on the wall], and each in front of his own house.”"
Nehemiah,7,4,"Now the city was spacious and large, but there were few people in it and the houses had not [yet] been built."
Nehemiah,7,5,"Then my God put it into my heart to assemble the nobles, the officials, and the people to be registered by genealogy. Then I found the register of the genealogy of those who came [from Babylon] first, and I found the following record"
Nehemiah,7,6,"These are the sons (descendants, people) of the province who came up from the captivity of the exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had deported [to Babylon]; they returned to Jerusalem and to Judah, each to his city"
Nehemiah,7,7,"the ones who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, and Baanah.

Nehemiah,7,63,"Of the priests: the sons of Hobaiah, the sons of Hakkoz, and the sons of Barzillai, who [was so named because he had] married one of the daughters of Barzillai, the [well-known] Gileadite, and was named after them."
Nehemiah,7,64,"These men searched for their ancestral registration among those recorded in the genealogies, but it was not located; so they were excluded from the priesthood as [ceremonially] unclean."
Nehemiah,7,65,The governor told them that they should not eat any of the most holy food until a priest arose with Urim and Thummim [to determine God’s will in the matter].
Nehemiah,7,66,"The entire assembly together was 42,360"
Nehemiah,7,67,"besides their male and their female servants, of whom there were 7,337; and they had 245 male and female singers."
Nehemiah,7,68,"Their horses were 736; their mules, 245"
Nehemiah,7,69,"their camels, 435; their donkeys, 6,720."

Nehemiah,7,71,"Some of the heads of fathers’ households gave to the treasury for the work 20,000 gold drachmas and 2,200 silver minas."
Nehemiah,7,72,"And what the rest of the people gave was 20,000 gold drachmas, 2,000 silver minas, and 67 priests’ garments."
Nehemiah,7,73,"So the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, some of the people, the temple servants, along with all Israel, lived in their cities.
A nd when the seventh month came, the sons (descendants) of Israel (Jacob) were in their cities."
Nehemiah,8,1,Then all the people gathered together as one man at the open square in front of the Water Gate; and they asked Ezra the scribe to bring the Book of the Law of Moses which the LORD had given to Israel.
Nehemiah,8,2,"So Ezra the priest brought the Law before the assembly of men, women and all who could listen with understanding, on the first day of the seventh month."
Nehemiah,8,3,"Then he read from it, in front of the open square which was in front of the Water Gate, from early morning until midday, in the presence of the men and women, those who could understand; and all the people listened carefully to the Book of the Law."
Nehemiah,8,4,"Ezra the scribe stood on a [large] wooden platform which they had constructed for this purpose. And beside him [on the platform] stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah on his right; and Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam on his left."
Nehemiah,8,5,"Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people, for he was standing above them; and when he opened it, all the people stood up."
Nehemiah,8,6,"Then Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God. And all the people answered, “Amen, Amen!” while lifting up their hands; and they knelt down and worshiped the LORD with their faces toward the ground."
Nehemiah,8,7,"Also Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, explained the Law to the people, and the people remained in their places."
Nehemiah,8,8,"So they read from the Book of the Law of God, translating and explaining it so that the people understood the reading."
Nehemiah,8,9,"Then Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who taught the people said to all the people, “This day is holy to the LORD your God; do not mourn or weep.” For all the people were weeping when they heard the words of the Law."
Nehemiah,8,10,"Then Ezra said to them, “Go [your way], eat the rich festival food, drink the sweet drink, and send portions to him for whom nothing is prepared; for this day is holy to our Lord. And do not be worried, for the joy of the LORD is your strength and your stronghold.”"
Nehemiah,8,11,"So the Levites quieted all the people, saying, “Be still, for the day is holy; do not be worried.”"
Nehemiah,8,12,"Then all the people went on their way to eat, to drink, to send portions [of food to others] and to celebrate a great festival, because they understood the words which had been communicated to them."
Nehemiah,8,13,"On the second day, all of the heads of fathers’ households of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, were gathered before Ezra the scribe to gain insight into the words of the Law (divine instruction)."
Nehemiah,8,14,They found written in the Law how the LORD had commanded through Moses that the Israelites should live in booths (huts) during the feast of the seventh month.
Nehemiah,8,15,"So they proclaimed and published an announcement in all their cities and in Jerusalem, saying, “Go out to the hills and bring olive branches, wild olive, myrtle, palm, and other leafy branches to make booths, as it is written.” [Lev 23:39, 40]"
Nehemiah,8,16,"So the people went out and brought them and made booths for themselves, each on the roof of his house, and in their courtyards and the courtyards of God’s house, and in the open square of the Water Gate and in the square of the Gate of Ephraim."
Nehemiah,8,17,"The entire assembly of those who had returned from the captivity made booths and lived in them. Indeed since the days of Joshua the son of Nun until that very day, the Israelites had not done so. And there was great rejoicing and celebration."
Nehemiah,8,18,"Every day, from the first day to the last, Ezra read from the Book of the Law of God. They celebrated the feast for seven days; on the eighth day there was a [closing] solemn assembly in accordance with the ordinance."
Nehemiah,9,1,Now on the twenty-fourth day of this month the Israelites assembled with fasting and in sackcloth and with dirt on their heads.
Nehemiah,9,2,"The descendants of Israel (Jacob) separated themselves from all foreigners, and stood and confessed their sins and the wrongdoings of their fathers."
Nehemiah,9,3,"While they stood in their places, they read from the Book of the Law of the LORD their God for a fourth of the day and for another fourth [of it] they confessed [their sins] and worshiped the LORD their God."
Nehemiah,9,4,"On the platform of the Levites stood Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and they called out with a loud voice to the LORD their God."
Nehemiah,9,5,"Then the Levites—Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah—said, “Stand up and bless (praise, honor) the LORD your God from everlasting to everlasting.
May Your glorious name be blessed
And exalted above all blessing and praise.”"
Nehemiah,9,6,"[And Ezra said],
“You are the LORD, You alone;
You have made the heavens,
The heaven of heavens with all their host (the heavenly bodies),
The earth and everything that is on it,
The seas and everything that is in them.
You give life to all of them,
And the heavenly host is bowing down [in worship] to You."
Nehemiah,9,7,"“You are the LORD God,
Who chose Abram
And brought him out of Ur of the Chaldees,
And gave him the name Abraham."
Nehemiah,9,8,"“You found his heart to be faithful before You,
And You made a covenant with him
To give him the land of the Canaanite,
Of the Hittite, of the Amorite,
Of the Perizzite, the Jebusite, and the Girgashite—
To give it to his descendants.
And You have fulfilled Your promise,
For You are righteous and just."
Nehemiah,9,9,"¶“You saw our fathers’ affliction in Egypt,
And You heard their cry by the Red Sea (Sea of Reeds)."
Nehemiah,9,10,"“Then You performed signs and wonders against Pharaoh,
Against all his servants and all the people of his land;
For You knew that they behaved arrogantly toward them (the Israelites),
And You made a name for Yourself, as it is to this day."
Nehemiah,9,11,"“You divided the sea before them,
So that they passed through the midst of the sea on dry land;
You hurled their pursuers into the depths,
Like a stone into mighty and raging waters."
Nehemiah,9,12,"“And with a pillar of cloud You led them by day,
And with a pillar of fire by night
To light the way for them
In which they were to go."
Nehemiah,9,13,"“Then You came down on Mount Sinai,
And spoke with them from heaven;
And You gave them fair ordinances and true laws,
Good statutes and commandments."
Nehemiah,9,14,"“So You made known to them Your holy Sabbath,
And gave them commandments, statutes, and law,
Through Your servant Moses."
Nehemiah,9,15,"“You gave them bread from heaven for their hunger,
And brought water for them out of a rock for their thirst,
And You told them to enter and take possession of
The land that You swore to give them. [John 6:31-34]"
Nehemiah,9,16,"¶“But they, our fathers, acted arrogantly;
They stiffened their necks and would not heed Your commandments."
Nehemiah,9,17,"“They refused to listen and obey,
And did not remember Your wondrous acts which You had performed among them;
So they stiffened their necks and [in their rebellion] appointed a leader in order to return them to slavery in Egypt.
But You are a God of forgiveness,
Gracious and merciful and compassionate,
Slow to anger and abounding in lovingkindness;
And You did not abandon them. [Num 14:4]"
Nehemiah,9,18,"“Even when they had made for themselves
A calf of cast metal
And said, ‘This is your god
Who brought you up from Egypt,’
And committed great [and contemptible] blasphemies"
Nehemiah,9,19,"You, in Your great mercy and compassion,
Did not abandon them in the wilderness;
The pillar of the cloud did not leave them by day,
To lead them in the way,
Nor the pillar of fire by night, to light for them the way they should go."
Nehemiah,9,20,"“You [also] gave Your good Spirit to instruct them,
You did not withhold Your manna from their mouth,
And You gave them water for their thirst."
Nehemiah,9,21,"“Indeed, for forty years You sustained them in the wilderness; they lacked nothing,
Their clothes did not wear out, and their feet did not swell."
Nehemiah,9,22,"“You also gave them kingdoms and peoples,
And You allotted the kingdoms to them as a boundary.
So they took possession of the land of Sihon king of Heshbon
And the land of Og king of Bashan."
Nehemiah,9,23,"“You made their children as numerous as the stars of heaven,
And You brought them into the land
Which You told their fathers to enter and possess."
Nehemiah,9,24,"“So their sons (descendants) went in and took possession of the land;
And You subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites,
And You gave them into their hand, with their kings and the peoples of the land,
To do with them as they pleased."
Nehemiah,9,25,"“They captured fortified cities and a fertile land.
They took possession of houses full of all good things,
Hewn cisterns, vineyards, olive groves,
And fruit trees in abundance.
So they ate and were filled and became fat,
And they reveled and were delighted in Your great goodness."
Nehemiah,9,26,"¶“Yet they were disobedient and rebelled against You,
And cast Your law behind their backs
And killed Your prophets who warned them
To return to You;
And they committed great [and contemptible] blasphemies."
Nehemiah,9,27,"“Therefore You handed them over to their enemies who oppressed them.
But when they cried out to You in the time of their suffering and distress,
You heard them from heaven, and according to Your great compassion You gave them people to rescue them.
Who rescued them from the hand of their enemies."
Nehemiah,9,28,"“But as soon as they had rest, they again did evil before You;
Therefore You abandoned them into the hand of their enemies, so that they ruled over them.
Yet when they turned and cried out again to You, You heard them from heaven,
And You rescued them many times in accordance with Your compassion"
Nehemiah,9,29,"And You admonished them and warned them to turn them back to Your law.
Yet they acted presumptuously and arrogantly and did not heed Your commandments, but sinned against Your ordinances,
Which by keeping, a man will live.
But they turned a stubborn shoulder, stiffened their neck, and would not listen."
Nehemiah,9,30,"“Yet You were patient with them for many years,
And admonished them and warned them by Your Spirit through Your prophets;
Still they would not listen.
Therefore You gave them into the hand (power) of the peoples of the lands."
Nehemiah,9,31,"“Yet in Your great compassion You did not utterly destroy them or abandon them,
For You are a gracious and merciful God."
Nehemiah,9,32,"¶“Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who keeps the covenant and lovingkindness,
Do not let all the hardship seem insignificant before You,
Which has come upon us, our kings, our princes, our priests, our prophets, our fathers and on all Your people,
Since the time of the kings of Assyria to this day."
Nehemiah,9,33,"“However, You are just and righteous in everything that has come upon us;
For You have dealt faithfully, but we have acted wickedly."
Nehemiah,9,34,"“Our kings, our princes, our priests, and our fathers have not kept Your law
Or paid attention to Your commandments and Your warnings which You have given them."
Nehemiah,9,35,"“But they, in their kingdom,
With Your great goodness which You gave them,
With the broad and rich land which You set before them,
Did not serve You or turn from their wicked deeds."
Nehemiah,9,36,"“Behold, we are slaves today,
And as for the land which You gave our fathers, to eat of its fruit and its goodness,
Behold, we are slaves in it."
Nehemiah,9,37,"“Its abundant produce is for the kings
Whom You have set over us because of our sins;
They also rule over our bodies
And over our cattle as they please,
So we are in great distress."
Nehemiah,9,38,"¶“Now because of all this
We are making an agreement in writing;
And on the sealed document are the names of our princes, our Levites, and our priests.”"

Nehemiah,10,29,"are joining with their fellow Israelites, their nobles, and are taking on themselves a curse and an oath to walk in God’s Law, which was given through Moses the servant of God, and to keep and to observe all the commandments of GOD our Lord, and His ordinances and statutes"

Nehemiah,12,37,At the Fountain Gate they went directly up the steps of the City of David by the stairway of the wall above David’s house to the Water Gate on the east.
Nehemiah,12,38,"The second choir went to the left; I followed with half of the people on the wall, above the Tower of the Furnaces, to the Broad Wall"
Nehemiah,12,39,"and above the Gate of Ephraim, and by the Old Gate, by the Fish Gate, by the Tower of Hananel and the Tower of the Hundred, as far as the Sheep Gate; and they stopped at the Gate of the Guard."
Nehemiah,12,40,"Then the two choirs stood in the house of God. So did I, and half of the officials with me"
Nehemiah,12,41,"and the priests Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah and Hananiah, with trumpets"
Nehemiah,12,42,"and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang, with Jezrahiah as their leader."
Nehemiah,12,43,"Also on that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced because God had given them great joy; the women and children also rejoiced, so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard from far away."
Nehemiah,12,44,"On that day men were appointed over the chambers for the stores, the contributions, the first fruits, and the tithes, to gather into them from the fields of the cities the portions required by the law for the priests and the Levites; for Judah rejoiced over the priests and Levites who served."
Nehemiah,12,45,"And they performed the worship of their God and the service of purification; so did the singers and gatekeepers, as David and his son Solomon had commanded."
Nehemiah,12,46,"For in the days of David and Asaph, in ancient times, there were leaders of singers, songs of praise and hymns of thanksgiving to God."
Nehemiah,12,47,"So in the days of Zerubbabel and [later of] Nehemiah, all Israel would give the daily portions for the singers and the gatekeepers; and they set apart the consecrated portion for the Levites, and the Levites set apart the consecrated portion for the sons of Aaron [the priests]."
Nehemiah,13,1,"On that day they read aloud from the book of Moses so that the people could hear [its words], and in it was found written that no Ammonite or Moabite could ever enter the assembly of God"
Nehemiah,13,2,"because they did not meet the Israelites with bread and water, but hired Balaam against them to curse them. Yet our God turned the curse into a blessing. [Num 22:3-11; Deut 23:5, 6]"
Nehemiah,13,3,"When the Jews heard the law, they separated from Israel all who were of foreign descent."
Nehemiah,13,4,"Now prior to this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God, and was related to Tobiah [our adversary]"
Nehemiah,13,5,"had prepared for Tobiah a large room (chamber) where previously they had put the grain offerings, the frankincense, the utensils, and the tithes of grain, new wine, and [olive] oil which were given by commandment for the Levites, the singers, and gatekeepers, and the contributions for the priests."
Nehemiah,13,6,"But during all this time I was not at Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes [Persian] king of Babylon I went to the king. Then after some time I asked for a leave [of absence] from the king"
Nehemiah,13,7,and I came to Jerusalem. Then I discovered the evil [thing] that Eliashib had done for Tobiah by preparing a room for him in the courtyards of the house of God.
Nehemiah,13,8,"It was very displeasing to me, so I threw all of Tobiah’s household furnishings out of the room."
Nehemiah,13,9,"Then I gave an order, and they cleaned the rooms; and I put back there the utensils of the house of God with the grain offerings and the frankincense."
Nehemiah,13,10,"I also discovered that the portions due the Levites had not been given to them, so that the Levites and the singers who did the work had gone away, each one back to his own field."
Nehemiah,13,11,"Then I reprimanded the officials and said, “Why is the house of God neglected?” So I gathered the Levites and singers together and restored them at their posts."
Nehemiah,13,12,"Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain, the new wine, and the oil to the storehouses."
Nehemiah,13,13,"I appointed [as treasurers] over the storehouses: Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah of the Levites; assisting them was Hanan son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were considered faithful and reliable, and their task was to distribute [supplies] to their brothers (fellow Levites)."
Nehemiah,13,14,"O my God, remember me concerning this and do not wipe out my loyal deeds and kindnesses which I have done for the house of my God and for its services."
Nehemiah,13,15,"In those days I saw some in Judah who were treading wine presses on the Sabbath, and bringing in sheaves or sacks of grain and loading them on donkeys, as well as wine, grapes, figs, and all kinds of loads, which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. So I protested and warned them on the day they sold the produce."
Nehemiah,13,16,"Also men of Tyre were living there who brought fish and all kinds of merchandise, and they were selling them to the people of Judah on the Sabbath, even in Jerusalem."
Nehemiah,13,17,"Then I reprimanded the nobles of Judah, and said to them, “What is this evil thing that you are doing—profaning the Sabbath day?"
Nehemiah,13,18,"Did your fathers (ancestors) not do the same, and did our God not bring all this trouble on us and on this city? Yet you are adding to the wrath on Israel by profaning the Sabbath.”"
Nehemiah,13,19,"Now when it began to get dark at the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath [began], I commanded that the doors be shut and not be opened until after the Sabbath. Then I stationed some of my servants at the gates so that no load [of merchandise] would enter [Jerusalem] on the Sabbath day."
Nehemiah,13,20,So once or twice the merchants and sellers of every kind of merchandise spent the night outside Jerusalem.
Nehemiah,13,21,"But I warned them, saying, “Why do you spend the night by the wall? If you do so again, I will use force against you.” From that time on, they did not come on the Sabbath."
Nehemiah,13,22,"And I commanded the Levites to purify themselves and come and guard the gates to keep the Sabbath day holy. O my God, remember me concerning this also and have compassion on me according to the greatness of Your lovingkindness."
Nehemiah,13,23,"In those days I also saw Jews who had married women from Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab."
Nehemiah,13,24,"As for their children, half spoke in the language of Ashdod, and none of them knew how to speak [Hebrew] the language of Judah, but only the language of his own people."
Nehemiah,13,25,"So I contended with them and cursed them and struck some of them and pulled out their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, “You shall not give your daughters [in marriage] to their sons, nor take [any of] their daughters for your sons or for yourselves."
Nehemiah,13,26,"Did not Solomon king of Israel sin [greatly against God] regarding these things? Yet among the many nations there was no king like him. He was loved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel; nevertheless the foreign women caused even him to sin [by turning to other gods and so, judged by God, he lost his kingdom]. [1 Kin 11:1-11]"
Nehemiah,13,27,"Do we then hear about you that you have done all this great evil, acting unfaithfully against our God by marrying foreign (pagan) women?”"
Nehemiah,13,28,"One of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was a son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite, so I chased him away from me."
Nehemiah,13,29,"O my God, remember them, because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites."
Nehemiah,13,30,"Thus I cleansed and purified them from everything foreign (pagan), and I defined the duties of the priests and Levites, each one in his task"
Nehemiah,13,31,"and I provided for the wood offering at appointed times and for the first fruits. O my God, [please] remember me for good [and imprint me on Your heart]."
