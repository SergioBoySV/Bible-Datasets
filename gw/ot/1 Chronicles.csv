1 Chronicles,11,6,"Now, David said, “Whoever is the first to kill a Jebusite will be made a general and a prince.” Zeruiah’s son Joab was the first to go ⌞into Jerusalem⌟, so he became the general."
1 Chronicles,11,7,"David lived in the fortress, so it was called the City of David."
1 Chronicles,11,8,"He built the city ⌞of Jerusalem⌟ around it, starting from the Millo  and making a complete circuit. Joab rebuilt the rest of the city."
1 Chronicles,11,9,David continued to grow more powerful because the LORD of Armies was with him.
1 Chronicles,11,10,"Now, these were the commanders of David’s fighting men, who exercised power with him in his kingdom, and with all Israel they made him king according to the LORD’s word to Israel."
1 Chronicles,11,11,"The first of David’s fighting men was Jashobeam, son of Hachmon, the leader of the three. He used his spear to kill 300 men on one occasion."
1 Chronicles,11,12,"Next in rank to him was Eleazar, another one of the three fighting men. He was the son of Dodo and grandson of Aho."
1 Chronicles,11,13,Eleazar was with David at Pas Dammim when the Philistines gathered there for battle. There was a field of ripe barley. When the troops fled from the Philistines
1 Chronicles,11,14,they stood in the middle of the field and defended it by killing Philistines. So the LORD saved ⌞them⌟ with an impressive victory.
1 Chronicles,11,15,Once three of the thirty leading men went down to David’s rock at the cave of Adullam when the army of the Philistines was camping in the valley of Rephaim.
1 Chronicles,11,16,"While David was in the fortified camp, Philistine troops were in Bethlehem."
1 Chronicles,11,17,"David was thirsty and said, “I wish I could have a drink of water from the cistern at the city gate of Bethlehem.”"
1 Chronicles,11,18,"So the three burst into the Philistine camp and drew water from the cistern. They brought it to David, but he refused to drink it. He poured it out ⌞as an offering⌟ to the LORD"
1 Chronicles,11,19,"and said, “It’s unthinkable that I would do this, God. Should I drink the blood of these men who risked their lives? They had to risk their lives to get this water.” So he refused to drink it.
These are the things which the three fighting men did."
1 Chronicles,11,20,"Joab’s brother Abishai was the leader of the thirty. He used his spear to kill 300 men, but he was not one of the three"
1 Chronicles,11,21,although he was honored more than they were. So he became their captain but didn’t become a member of the three.
1 Chronicles,11,22,"Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, was from Kabzeel and was a brave man who did many things. He killed two distinguished soldiers from Moab. He also went into a cistern and killed a lion on the day it snowed."
1 Chronicles,11,23,"He killed an eight-foot-tall Egyptian. The Egyptian had a spear like a weaver’s beam in his hand. But Benaiah went to him with a club, grabbed the spear away from him, and killed him with it."
1 Chronicles,11,24,"These are the things that Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, did. He was as famous as the three fighting men."
1 Chronicles,11,25,"He was honored more than the thirty, but he was not a member of the three. David put him in charge of his bodyguards."

“We are yours, David.
We are with you, son of Jesse.
Success, success to you!
Success to those who help you,
because your God is helping you.”
So David welcomed them and made them officers over his troops."
1 Chronicles,12,19,"Some men from Manasseh had deserted ⌞Saul’s army⌟ to join David when he went with the Philistines to attack Saul.

1 Chronicles,12,20,"When David went to Ziklag, these men from Manasseh deserted to join him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai. Each one was an officer over 1,000 men in Manasseh."

1 Chronicles,12,40,"Also, their neighbors as far as the territories of Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali brought food on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen. There was plenty of flour, fig cakes, raisins, wine, olive oil, cattle, and sheep, because Israel was celebrating."
1 Chronicles,13,1,David consulted with every officer who commanded a regiment or battalion.

1 Chronicles,13,10,The LORD became angry with Uzzah and killed him for reaching for the ark. He died in God’s presence.
1 Chronicles,13,11,David was angry because the LORD had struck Uzzah so violently. (That place is still called Perez Uzzah [The Striking of Uzzah] today.)
1 Chronicles,13,12,David was afraid of God that day. “How can I bring God’s ark to my ⌞city⌟?” he asked.
1 Chronicles,13,13,"So he didn’t bring God’s ark to his ⌞home⌟, the City of David. Instead, he rerouted it to the home of Obed Edom, who was from Gath."

1 Chronicles,14,10,"David asked God, “Should I attack the Philistines? Will you hand them over to me?”
The LORD answered him, “Attack! I will hand them over to you.”"
1 Chronicles,14,11,"So David ⌞and his men⌟ attacked and defeated the Philistines at Baal Perazim. David said, “Using my power like an overwhelming flood, God has overwhelmed my enemies.” That is why they call that place Baal Perazim [The Lord Overwhelms]."
1 Chronicles,14,12,"The Philistines left their gods there, so David ordered that the gods be burned."
1 Chronicles,14,13,The Philistines again raided the valley.
1 Chronicles,14,14,"Once more David asked God.
God answered him, “Don’t go after them. Circle around, and come at them in front of the balsam trees."

1 Chronicles,15,12,"He said to them, “You are the heads of the Levite families. You and your relatives must perform the ceremonies to make yourselves holy. Then bring the ark of the LORD God of Israel to the place I prepared for it."
1 Chronicles,15,13,"Because you weren’t there the first time, the LORD our God struck us. We hadn’t dedicated our lives to serving him in the way ⌞he⌟ designated.”"
1 Chronicles,15,14,So the priests and the Levites made themselves holy in order to move the ark of the LORD God of Israel.

1 Chronicles,19,5,"After people told David ⌞what had happened⌟ to the men, he sent ⌞someone⌟ to meet them because they were deeply humiliated. The king said to them, “Stay in Jericho until your beards have grown back, and then return ⌞to Jerusalem⌟.”"

1 Chronicles,19,16,"Realizing that Israel had defeated them, the kings sent ⌞messengers⌟ to get ⌞other⌟ Arameans from beyond the Euphrates River. Shophach, the commander of Hadadezer’s army, led them."

1 Chronicles,21,2,"David said to Joab and the leaders of the people, “Go, count Israel from Beersheba to Dan. Bring me ⌞the results⌟ so that I may know how many ⌞people⌟ there are.”"
1 Chronicles,21,3,"Joab responded, “May the LORD multiply his people a hundred times over. But, Your Majesty, aren’t they all your servants? Why are you trying to do this? Why do you wish to make Israel guilty of ⌞this⌟ sin?”"
1 Chronicles,21,4,"However, the king overruled Joab. So Joab left, went throughout Israel, and returned to Jerusalem."
1 Chronicles,21,5,"Joab reported the census figures to David: In Israel there were 1,100,000 men who could serve in the army, and in Judah there were 470,000 who could serve in the army."
1 Chronicles,21,6,Joab didn’t include Levi and Benjamin in the number because he was disgusted with the king’s order.
1 Chronicles,21,7,"God considered the census to be sinful, so he struck Israel ⌞with a plague⌟."
1 Chronicles,21,8,"David said to God, “I have committed a terrible sin by doing this thing. Forgive me because I have acted very foolishly.”"

1 Chronicles,21,10,"“Go and tell David, ‘This is what the LORD says: I’m offering you three choices. Choose the one you want me to do to you.’ ”"
1 Chronicles,21,11,"When Gad came to David, he said, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Take your pick"
1 Chronicles,21,12,"either three years of famine, or three months during which your enemies will chase you away when their swords catch up to you, or three days of the LORD’s sword—a plague in the land with the Messenger of the LORD destroying the whole country of Israel.’ Decide what answer I should give the one who sent me.”"
1 Chronicles,21,13,"“I’m in a desperate situation,” David told Gad. “Please let me fall into the LORD’s hands because he is extremely merciful. But don’t let me fall into human hands.”"
1 Chronicles,21,14,"So the LORD sent a plague on Israel, and 70,000 Israelites died."
1 Chronicles,21,15,"God also sent a Messenger to Jerusalem to destroy it, but as he was destroying it, the LORD reconsidered and changed his mind about the disaster. “Enough!” he said to the destroying Messenger. “Put down your weapon.” The Messenger of the LORD was standing by the threshing floor  of Ornan the Jebusite."
1 Chronicles,21,16,"When David looked up, he saw the Messenger of the LORD standing between heaven and earth. The Messenger had a sword in his hand and stretched it over Jerusalem. David and the leaders were dressed in sackcloth. They bowed down with their faces touching the ground."
1 Chronicles,21,17,"David said to God, “I’m the one who ordered the people to be counted. I am the one who sinned and did wrong. What have these sheep done? LORD my God, let your punishment be against me and my father’s family, but don’t punish your people with a plague.”"
1 Chronicles,21,18,The LORD’s Messenger told Gad to tell David to go and set up an altar for the LORD at Ornan the Jebusite’s threshing floor.
1 Chronicles,21,19,David went as Gad had told him in the LORD’s name.
1 Chronicles,21,20,"Now, Ornan had turned around and seen the Messenger. Ornan’s four sons who were with him hid, but Ornan kept on threshing the wheat."
1 Chronicles,21,21,"When David arrived, Ornan looked up and saw him. So he left the threshing floor and bowed down with his face touching the ground in front of David."
1 Chronicles,21,22,"David said to Ornan, “Let me have the land this threshing floor is on. I’ll build an altar for the LORD on it. Sell it to me for the full price. Then the plague on the people will stop.”"
1 Chronicles,21,23,"Ornan said to David, “Take it, Your Majesty, and do whatever you think is right. I’ll give you oxen for the burnt offering, threshers  for firewood, and wheat for the grain offering. I’ll give you everything.”"
1 Chronicles,21,24,"“No,” King David told Ornan, “I insist on buying it for the full price. I won’t take what is yours for the LORD and offer burnt sacrifices that cost me nothing.”"
1 Chronicles,21,25,So David gave Ornan 15 pounds of gold for that place.
1 Chronicles,21,26,"David built an altar for the LORD there and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. He called on the LORD, and the LORD answered him by ⌞sending⌟ fire from heaven on the altar for burnt offerings."
1 Chronicles,21,27,"So the LORD spoke to the Messenger, and he put his sword back in its scabbard."
1 Chronicles,21,28,"At that time, when David saw the LORD had answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he offered sacrifices there."
1 Chronicles,21,29,The LORD’s tent that Moses made in the desert and the altar for burnt offerings were at the worship site at Gibeon.
1 Chronicles,21,30,"However, David couldn’t go there to consult God because he was frightened by the sword of the LORD’s Messenger."

1 Chronicles,22,2,David ordered the foreigners living in Israel to gather. He appointed some of them to cut stones to build God’s temple.
1 Chronicles,22,3,David prepared a large quantity of iron for nails and fittings on the doors of the gates. He also prepared so much bronze that it couldn’t be weighed.
1 Chronicles,22,4,The men of Sidon and Tyre brought David so many cedar logs that the logs couldn’t be counted.
1 Chronicles,22,5,"David thought, “My son Solomon is young and inexperienced, and the temple that will be built for the LORD must be magnificent, large, famous, praised, and honored in all other countries. I’ll prepare ⌞the building materials⌟ for him.” So David prepared many materials ⌞for Solomon⌟ before he died."
1 Chronicles,22,6,He summoned his son Solomon and commanded him to build a temple for the LORD God of Israel.
1 Chronicles,22,7,"David told his son Solomon, “I had my heart set on building a temple for the name of the LORD, my God."
1 Chronicles,22,8,"But the LORD spoke his word to me by saying, ‘You have caused a lot of bloodshed and fought in a lot of wars. You must not build a temple for my name because you have caused so much bloodshed in my presence."
1 Chronicles,22,9,"You will have a son who will be a peaceful man. I will give him peace from all the enemies around him. His name will be Solomon [Peace], and in his time I will give Israel peace and quiet."
1 Chronicles,22,10,"He will build a temple for my name. He will be my son, and I will be his father. I will establish the throne of his kingdom permanently over Israel.’ ”"
1 Chronicles,22,11,"⌞David continued,⌟ “Now, son, the LORD will be with you. You will be successful, and you will build the temple of the LORD your God as he predicted you would."
1 Chronicles,22,12,The LORD will give you insight and understanding as he commands you to take charge of Israel and to follow the Teachings of the LORD your God.
1 Chronicles,22,13,Then you will succeed if you will carefully obey the laws and decrees the LORD commanded Moses to give to Israel. Be strong and courageous. Don’t be afraid or terrified.
1 Chronicles,22,14,"“Despite my troubles I’ve made preparations for the LORD’s temple. There are 7,500,000 pounds of gold, 75,000,000 pounds of silver, and so much bronze and iron that it can’t be weighed. I’ve also prepared wood and stones, and you may add to them."
1 Chronicles,22,15,"You have many kinds of workers: stonecutters, masons, carpenters, and men skilled in every kind of work."
1 Chronicles,22,16,"The gold, silver, bronze, and iron are more than can be counted. So get to work! May the LORD be with you.”"
1 Chronicles,22,17,David ordered all the leaders of Israel to help his son Solomon.
1 Chronicles,22,18,"⌞David said,⌟ “Isn’t the LORD your God with you? Hasn’t he given you peace with all your neighbors? He put the people who live in this country under my power, and the country has been conquered by the LORD and his people."
1 Chronicles,22,19,So dedicate your hearts and lives to serving the LORD your God. Start building the holy place of the LORD God so that you can bring the ark of the LORD’s promise and God’s holy utensils into the temple that will be built for the LORD’s name.”
