Isaiah,1,1,"This is the vision which Isaiah, son of Amoz, saw about Judah and Jerusalem at the time of Kings Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah."
Isaiah,1,2,"Listen, heaven, and pay attention, earth!
The LORD has spoken,
“I raised ⌞my⌟ children and helped them grow,
but they have rebelled against me."
Isaiah,1,3,"Oxen know their owners,
and donkeys know where their masters feed them.
But Israel doesn’t know ⌞its owner⌟.
My people don’t understand ⌞who feeds them⌟."
Isaiah,1,4,"“How horrible it will be for a nation that sins.
⌞Its⌟ people are loaded down with guilt.
They are descendants of evildoers
and destructive children.
They have abandoned the LORD.
They have despised the Holy One of Israel.
They have turned their backs on him."
Isaiah,1,5,"“Why do you still want to be beaten?
Why do you continue to rebel?
Your whole head is infected.
Your whole heart is failing."
Isaiah,1,6,"From the bottom of your feet to the top of your head
there is no healthy spot left on your ⌞body⌟—
only bruises, sores, and fresh wounds.
They haven’t been cleansed, bandaged,
or soothed with oil."
Isaiah,1,7,"“Your country is devastated.
Your cities are burned down.
Your fields are destroyed right before your eyes by foreigners.
Your fields are devastated and taken over by foreigners."
Isaiah,1,8,"My people Zion are left like a hut in a vineyard,
like a shack in a cucumber field,
like a city under attack.”"
Isaiah,1,9,"If the LORD of Armies hadn’t left us a few survivors,
we would have been like Sodom and Gomorrah."
Isaiah,1,10,"Listen to the LORD’s word, you rulers of Sodom!
Pay attention to the teachings from our God, you people of Gomorrah!"
Isaiah,1,11,"The LORD asks, “What do your many animal sacrifices mean to me?
I’ve had enough of your burnt offerings of rams
and enough fat from your fattened calves.
I’m not pleased with the blood of bulls, lambs, or male goats."
Isaiah,1,12,"When you appear in my presence,
who asked you to trample on my courtyards?"
Isaiah,1,13,"Don’t bring any more worthless grain offerings.
Your incense is disgusting to me,
so are your New Moon Festivals, your days of rest—holy days,
and the assemblies you call.
I can’t stand your evil assemblies."
Isaiah,1,14,"I hate your New Moon Festivals and your appointed festivals.
They’ve become a burden to me,
and I’m tired of putting up with them."
Isaiah,1,15,"So when you stretch out your hands ⌞in prayer⌟,
I will turn my eyes away from you.
Even though you offer many prayers,
I will not listen because your hands are covered with blood."
Isaiah,1,16,"“Wash yourselves! Become clean!
Get your evil deeds out of my sight.
Stop doing evil."
Isaiah,1,17,"Learn to do good.
Seek justice.
Arrest oppressors.
Defend orphans.
Plead the case of widows.”"
Isaiah,1,18,"“Come on now, let’s discuss this!” says the LORD.
“Though your sins are bright red,
they will become as white as snow.
Though they are dark red,
they will become as white as wool."
Isaiah,1,19,"If you are willing and obedient,
you will eat the best from the land."
Isaiah,1,20,"But if you refuse and rebel,
you will be destroyed by swords.”
The LORD has spoken."
Isaiah,1,21,"How the faithful town has become a prostitute!
She was full of justice,
and righteousness lived in her.
But now murderers live there!"
Isaiah,1,22,"Your silver is not pure.
Your wine is watered down."
Isaiah,1,23,"Your rulers are rebels, friends with thieves.
They all love bribes and run after gifts.
They never defend orphans.
They don’t notice the widows’ pleas."
Isaiah,1,24,"That’s why the Lord, the LORD of Armies, the Mighty One of Israel, says,
“How horrible it will be when I take revenge on my opponents!
I will avenge myself against my enemies."
Isaiah,1,25,"I will turn my power against you.
I will remove your impurities with bleach.
I will get rid of all your impurities."
Isaiah,1,26,"I will give you judges like you had long ago,
advisers like you had in the beginning.
After that you will be called the Righteous City,
the Faithful Town.”"
Isaiah,1,27,"Zion will be pardoned by ⌞the LORD’s⌟ justice,
and those who return will be pardoned
by ⌞the LORD’s⌟ righteousness."
Isaiah,1,28,"Rebels and sinners will be crushed at the same time,
and those who abandon the LORD will come to an end."
Isaiah,1,29,"You will be ashamed of the oaks that you wanted to worship
and embarrassed by the garden that you have chosen for your gods."

and like a garden without water."
Isaiah,1,31,"Strong people will become tinder for a fire,
and their work will be the spark.
Both of them will burn together,
and there will be no one to put out the fire."
Isaiah,2,1,"This is the message which Isaiah, son of Amoz, saw about Judah and Jerusalem."
Isaiah,2,2,"In the last days the mountain of the LORD’s house
will be established as the highest of the mountains
and raised above the hills.
All the nations will stream to it."
Isaiah,2,3,"Then many people will come and say,
“Let’s go to the mountain of the LORD,
to the house of the God of Jacob.
He will teach us his ways so that we may live by them.”
The teachings will go out from Zion.
The LORD’s word will go out from Jerusalem."
Isaiah,2,4,"Then he will judge disputes between nations
and settle arguments between many people.
They will hammer their swords into plowblades
and their spears into pruning shears.
Nations will never fight against each other,
and they will never train for war again."
Isaiah,2,5,"Come, descendants of Jacob,
let’s live in the light of the LORD."
Isaiah,2,6,"LORD, you have abandoned your people, the descendants of Jacob,
because they are filled with Eastern influences.
They are fortunetellers like the Philistines,
and they make deals with foreigners."
Isaiah,2,7,"Their land is filled with silver and gold,
and there is no end to their treasures.
Their land is filled with horses,
and there is no end to their chariots."

and all the lofty hills"
Isaiah,2,15,"against every high tower
and every fortified wall"
Isaiah,2,16,"against all the large ships of Tarshish
and all the beautiful boats."

and high and mighty people will be humbled.
On that day the LORD alone will be honored."
Isaiah,2,18,Then idols will disappear completely.

and into holes in the ground
because of the LORD’s terrifying presence

the silver and gold idols that they made
for themselves to worship."

and into cracks in the cliffs
because of the LORD’s terrifying presence
and the honor of his majesty
when he rises to terrify the earth."

Their life is in their nostrils.
How can they be worth anything?"

is going to take from Jerusalem and Judah
every kind of support
and their entire supply of food and water."
Isaiah,3,2,"⌞He will take their⌟ heroes and soldiers,
judges and prophets,
fortunetellers and statesmen"

counselors, skilled workers, and experts in magic."
Isaiah,3,4,"“I will make boys their leaders.
Children will govern them.”"

Isaiah,3,6,"A person will grab one of his relatives
from his father’s family and say,
“You have a coat.
You’ll be our leader.

“I’m not a doctor!
I don’t have any food or a coat in my home.
Don’t make me a leader of our family.”"
Isaiah,3,8,"Jerusalem has stumbled, and Judah has fallen,
because what they say and what they do is against the LORD.
They are defiant in his honored presence."
Isaiah,3,9,"The look on their faces will be held against them.
They boast about their sins,
which are like ⌞those of the people of⌟ Sodom.
They don’t even bother to hide them.
How horrible it will be for these people,
because they have brought disaster on themselves."
Isaiah,3,10,"Tell the righteous that blessings will come to them.
They will taste the fruit of their labor."
Isaiah,3,11,"How horrible it will be for the wicked! Disaster will strike them.
What they have done will be done to them."

Women will rule them.

He stands to judge his people."

and the officials of his people:
“You have burned down the vineyard!
Your houses are filled with goods stolen from the poor.”"
Isaiah,3,15,"The Almighty LORD of Armies asks,
“How can you crush my people
and grind the faces of the poor ⌞into the ground⌟?”"
Isaiah,3,16,"The LORD adds,
“The women of Zion are arrogant.
They walk with their noses in the air,
making seductive glances,
taking short little steps,
jingling the ankle bracelets on their feet.”"
Isaiah,3,17,"The Lord will cause sores ⌞to appear⌟
on the heads of the women of Zion,
and the LORD will make their foreheads bare."
Isaiah,3,18,"On that day the Lord will take away their fine things: jingling anklets, headbands, crescent-shaped necklaces"
Isaiah,3,19,"pendants, bracelets, scarfs"
Isaiah,3,20,"hats, ankle bracelets, blouses, perfume boxes, charms"
Isaiah,3,21,"signet rings, nose rings"
Isaiah,3,22,"fine robes, coats, shawls, purses"
Isaiah,3,23,"mirrors, underwear, headdresses, and veils."
Isaiah,3,24,"Instead of the smell of perfume, there will be the smell of decay.
They will wear ropes instead of belts.
They will have bald heads instead of beautiful hair.
They will wear sackcloth instead of expensive clothes.
Their beauty will be scarred."
Isaiah,3,25,"⌞Women,⌟ your warriors will die in combat.
Your mighty men will die in battle."
Isaiah,3,26,"The gates of Zion will cry and grieve,
and Zion will sit on the ground, exhausted."

“We’ll eat our own food and provide our own clothes.
Just let us marry you for your name.
Take away our disgrace.”"
Isaiah,4,2,"When that day comes, the branch of the LORD
will be beautiful and wonderful.
The fruit of the land
will be the pride and joy of Israel’s survivors."
Isaiah,4,3,"Then whoever is left in Zion and whoever remains in Jerusalem will be called holy, everyone who is recorded among the living in Jerusalem."
Isaiah,4,4,The Lord will wash away the filth of Zion’s people. He will clean bloodstains from Jerusalem with a spirit of judgment and a spirit of burning.
Isaiah,4,5,The LORD will create a cloud of smoke during the day and a glowing flame of fire during the night over the whole area of Mount Zion and over the assembly. His glory will cover everything.
Isaiah,4,6,It will be a shelter from the heat during the day as well as a refuge and hiding place from storms and rain.
Isaiah,5,1,"Let me sing a lovesong to my beloved about his vineyard:
My beloved had a vineyard on a fertile hill."
Isaiah,5,2,"He dug it up, removed its stones,
planted it with the choicest vines,
built a watchtower in it,
and made a winepress in it.
Then he waited for it to produce good grapes,
but it produced only sour, wild grapes."
Isaiah,5,3,"Now then, you inhabitants of Jerusalem and Judah,
judge between me and my vineyard!"
Isaiah,5,4,"What more could have been done for my vineyard
than what I have already done for it?
When I waited for it to produce good grapes,
why did it produce only sour, wild grapes?"
Isaiah,5,5,"Now then, let me tell you what I will do to my vineyard.
I will tear away its hedge so that it can be devoured
and tear down its wall so that it can be trampled."
Isaiah,5,6,"I will make it a wasteland.
It will never be pruned or hoed.
Thorns and weeds will grow in it,
and I will command the clouds not to rain on it."
Isaiah,5,7,"The vineyard of the LORD of Armies is the nation of Israel,
and the people of Judah are the garden of his delight.
He hoped for justice but saw only slaughter,
for righteousness but heard only cries of distress."
Isaiah,5,8,"How horrible it will be for you
who acquire house after house and buy field after field
until there’s nothing left
and you have to live by yourself in the land."
Isaiah,5,9,"With my own ears I heard the LORD of Armies say,
“Many houses will become empty.
Large, beautiful houses will be without people to live in them."
Isaiah,5,10,"A ten-acre vineyard will produce only six gallons of wine,
and two quarts of seed will produce only four quarts of grain.”"
Isaiah,5,11,"How horrible it will be for those
who get up early to look for a drink,
who sit up late until they are drunk from wine."
Isaiah,5,12,"At their feasts there are lyres and harps,
tambourines and flutes, and wine.
Yet, they don’t pay attention to what the LORD is doing
or see what his hands have done."
Isaiah,5,13,"“My people will go into exile
because they don’t understand what I’m doing.
Honored men will starve,
and common people will be parched with thirst.”"
Isaiah,5,14,"That is why the grave’s appetite increases.
It opens its mouth very wide
so that honored people and common people will go down into it.
Those who are noisy and joyous will go down into it."
Isaiah,5,15,"People will be brought down. Everyone will be humbled.
And the eyes of arrogant people will be humbled."
Isaiah,5,16,"The LORD of Armies will be honored when he judges.
The holy God will show himself to be holy when he does what is right."
Isaiah,5,17,"Then lambs will graze as if they were in their own pasture,
and foreigners will eat among the ruins of the rich."
Isaiah,5,18,"How horrible it will be for those
who string people along with lies and empty promises,
whose lives are sinful."
Isaiah,5,19,"They say,
“Let God hurry and quickly do his work
so that we may see what he has in mind.
Let the plan of the Holy One of Israel happen quickly
so that we may understand what he is doing.”"
Isaiah,5,20,"How horrible it will be for those
who call evil good and good evil,
who turn darkness into light and light into darkness,
who turn what is bitter into something sweet
and what is sweet into something bitter."
Isaiah,5,21,"How horrible it will be for those
who think they are wise
and consider themselves to be clever."
Isaiah,5,22,"How horrible it will be for those
who are heroes at drinking wine,
who are champions at mixing drinks"
Isaiah,5,23,"who declare the guilty innocent for a bribe,
who take away the rights of righteous people."
Isaiah,5,24,"As flames burn up straw
and dry grass shrivels in flames,
so their roots will rot,
and their blossoms will blow away like dust.
They have rejected the teachings of the LORD of Armies
and have despised the word of the Holy One of Israel."
Isaiah,5,25,"That’s why the anger of the LORD burns hot against his people,
and he is ready to use his power to strike them down.
The hills tremble,
and dead bodies lie like garbage in the streets.
Even after all this, his anger has not disappeared,
and he is still ready to use his power."
Isaiah,5,26,"The LORD raises up a flag for the nations far away.
With a whistle he signals those at the ends of the earth.
Look, they are coming very quickly!"
Isaiah,5,27,"None of them grow tired or stumble.
None of them slumber or sleep.
The belts on their waists aren’t loose
or their sandal straps broken."
Isaiah,5,28,"Their arrows are sharpened; all their bows are ready to shoot.
Their horses’ hoofs are as hard as flint.
Their chariot wheels are as quick as the wind."
Isaiah,5,29,"They roar like a lioness.
They growl like a young lion.
They growl as they snatch their prey
and carry it off to where no one can rescue it."
Isaiah,5,30,"On that day they will roar over their prey
as the sea roars.
If they look at the land,
they will see only darkness and distress.
Even the light will be darkened by thick clouds."
Isaiah,6,1,"In the year King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a high and lofty throne. The bottom of his robe filled the temple."
Isaiah,6,2,"Angels  were standing above him. Each had six wings: With two they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they flew."
Isaiah,6,3,"They called to each other and said,
“Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of Armies!
The whole earth is filled with his glory.”"
Isaiah,6,4,"Their voices shook the foundations of the doorposts, and the temple filled with smoke."
Isaiah,6,5,"So I said, “Oh, no!
I’m doomed.
Every word that passes through my lips is sinful.
I live among people with sinful lips.
I have seen the king, the LORD of Armies!”"
Isaiah,6,6,Then one of the angels flew to me. In his hand was a burning coal that he had taken from the altar with tongs.
Isaiah,6,7,"He touched my mouth with it and said, “This has touched your lips. Your guilt has been taken away, and your sin has been forgiven.”"
Isaiah,6,8,"Then I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, “Whom will I send? Who will go for us?”
I said, “Here I am. Send me!”"
Isaiah,6,9,"And he said, “Go and tell these people,
‘No matter how closely you listen, you’ll never understand.
No matter how closely you look, you’ll never see.’"
Isaiah,6,10,"Make these people close-minded.
Plug their ears.
Shut their eyes.
Otherwise, they may see with their eyes,
hear with their ears,
understand with their minds,
and return and be healed.”"
Isaiah,6,11,"I asked, “How long, O Lord?”
And he replied,
“Until the cities lie in ruins with no one living in them,
the houses have no people,
and the land is completely desolate."
Isaiah,6,12,"The LORD will send his people far away,
and a large area in the middle of the land will be abandoned."
Isaiah,6,13,"Even if one out of ten people is left in it,
the land will be burned again.
When a sacred oak or an oak is cut down, a stump is left
The holy seed will be the land’s stump.”"
Isaiah,7,1,"When Ahaz, son of Jotham and grandson of Uzziah, was king of Judah, Aram’s King Rezin and Israel’s King Pekah, son of Remaliah, went to Jerusalem to attack it, but they couldn’t defeat it."
Isaiah,7,2,"When word reached David’s family that the Arameans had made an alliance with Ephraim, the hearts of the king and his people were shaken as the trees of the forest are shaken by the wind."
Isaiah,7,3,"Then the LORD said to Isaiah, “Go out with your son Shear Jashub to meet Ahaz at the end of the ditch of the Upper Pool on the road to the Laundryman’s Field."
Isaiah,7,4,"Say to him, ‘Be careful, stay calm, and don’t be afraid. Don’t lose heart because of the fierce anger of Rezin from Aram and Remaliah’s son. These two are smoldering logs.’"
Isaiah,7,5,"Aram, Ephraim, and Remaliah’s son have planned evil against you, saying"
Isaiah,7,6,"‘Let’s march against Judah, tear it apart, divide it among ourselves, and set up Tabeel’s son as its king.’"
Isaiah,7,7,"This is what the Almighty LORD says:
“It won’t take place; it won’t happen."
Isaiah,7,8,"The capital of Aram is Damascus,
and the leader of Damascus is Rezin.
Ephraim will be shattered within 65 years
so that it will no longer be a nation."
Isaiah,7,9,"The capital of Ephraim is Samaria,
and the leader of Samaria is Remaliah’s son.
If you don’t remain faithful,
you won’t remain standing.”"
Isaiah,7,10,Again the LORD spoke to Ahaz
Isaiah,7,11,“Ask the LORD your God for a sign. It can be anything you want.”
Isaiah,7,12,"But Ahaz answered, “I won’t ask; I wouldn’t think of testing the LORD.”"
Isaiah,7,13,"“Listen now, descendants of David,” Isaiah said. “Isn’t it enough that you try the patience of mortals? Must you also try the patience of my God?"
Isaiah,7,14,"So the Lord himself will give you this sign: A virgin will become pregnant and give birth to a son, and she will name him Immanuel [God Is With Us]."
Isaiah,7,15,He will eat cheese and honey until he knows how to reject evil and choose good.
Isaiah,7,16,"Indeed, before the boy knows how to reject evil and choose good, the land of the two kings who terrify you will be deserted."
Isaiah,7,17,"“The LORD will bring on you, your people, and your ancestor’s family a time unlike any since Ephraim broke away from Judah. ⌞He will bring⌟ the king of Assyria."
Isaiah,7,18,On that day the LORD will whistle for the flies that are at the distant branches of the Nile River in Egypt and for the bees that are in Assyria.
Isaiah,7,19,"All of them will come and settle in the deep valleys, in the cracks in the cliffs, on all the thornbushes, and at all the water holes."
Isaiah,7,20,"“On that day the Lord will hire the king of Assyria from beyond the Euphrates River to be a razor to shave the hair on your head, the hair on your legs, and even your beard."
Isaiah,7,21,On that day a person will keep alive a young cow and two sheep.
Isaiah,7,22,"That person will eat cheese, because they will produce so much milk. Everyone who is left in the land will eat cheese and honey."
Isaiah,7,23,"On that day, in every place where there were 1,000 vines (worth 1,000 pieces of silver), there will be briars and thorns."
Isaiah,7,24,People will come there with bows and arrows ⌞to hunt⌟ because the whole land will be filled with briars and thorns.
Isaiah,7,25,And you will no longer be able to go to all the hills which used to be cultivated because they will be filled with briars and thorns. It will be a place for turning oxen loose and letting sheep run.”
Isaiah,8,1,"The LORD said to me, “Take a large writing tablet, and write on it with a pen: ‘Maher Shalal Hash Baz’ [The Looting Will Come Quickly; the Prey Will Be Easy]."
Isaiah,8,2,I will have these dependable witnesses testify: the priest Uriah and Zechariah (son of Jeberechiah).”
Isaiah,8,3,"I slept with the prophet. She became pregnant and gave birth to a son. The LORD told me, “Name him Maher Shalal Hash Baz."
Isaiah,8,4,"Before the boy knows how to say ‘Daddy’ or ‘Mommy,’ the wealth of Damascus and the loot from Samaria will be carried away to the king of Assyria.”"
Isaiah,8,5,The LORD spoke to me again. He said
Isaiah,8,6,"“These people have rejected the gently flowing water of Shiloah
and find joy in Rezin and Remaliah’s son.”"
Isaiah,8,7,"That is why the Lord is going to bring against them
the raging and powerful floodwaters of the Euphrates River—
the king of Assyria with all his power.
It will overflow all its channels and go over all its banks."
Isaiah,8,8,"It will sweep through Judah.
It will overflow and pass through; it will be neck-high.
Its outspread wings will extend over your whole country, O Immanuel."
Isaiah,8,9,"Be broken, you people. Be terrified.
Listen, all you distant parts of the earth.
Prepare for battle, but be terrified.
Prepare for battle, but be terrified."
Isaiah,8,10,"Make plans for battle, but they will never succeed.
Give orders, but they won’t be carried out,
because God is with us!"
Isaiah,8,11,"This is what the LORD said with his powerful hand on me.
He warned me not to follow the ways of these people"
Isaiah,8,12,"“Don’t say that everything these people call a conspiracy
is a conspiracy.
Don’t fear what they fear.
Don’t let it terrify you.”"
Isaiah,8,13,"Remember that the LORD of Armies is holy.
He is the one you should fear
and the one you should be terrified of."
Isaiah,8,14,"He will be a place of safety for you.
But he will be a rock that makes people trip
and a stumbling block for both kingdoms of Israel.
He will be a trap and a snare for those who live in Jerusalem."
Isaiah,8,15,"Many will stumble.
They will fall and be broken.
They will be trapped and caught."
Isaiah,8,16,"Tie up the written instructions.
Seal the teachings among my disciples."
Isaiah,8,17,"I will wait for the LORD,
who hides his face from the descendants of Jacob.
I will hope in him."
Isaiah,8,18,"I am here with the children that the LORD has given me.
We are signs and symbols in Israel
from the Lord of Armies, who lives on Mount Zion."
Isaiah,8,19,"People will say to you, “Ask for help from the mediums
and the fortunetellers, who whisper and mutter.”
Shouldn’t people ask their God for help instead?
Why should they ask the dead to help the living?"
Isaiah,8,20,"They should go to the teachings and to the written instructions.
If people don’t speak these words,
it is because it doesn’t dawn on them."
Isaiah,8,21,"They will pass through the land when they are hard-pressed and hungry.
When they are hungry, they will be furious.
Then they will look up, cursing their king and God."
Isaiah,8,22,"They will look at the earth and see only distress and gloom.
They will go in anguish and be forced into darkness."
Isaiah,9,1,"But there will be no more gloom
for the land that is in distress.
God humbled the lands of Zebulun and Naphtali in earlier times.
But in the future he will bring glory to the road by the sea,
to the land across the Jordan River,
to Galilee, where foreigners live."
Isaiah,9,2,"The people who walk in darkness will see a bright light.
The light will shine on those who live in the land of death’s shadow."
Isaiah,9,3,"You will expand the nation and increase its happiness.
It will be happy in your presence
like those who celebrate the harvest
or rejoice when dividing loot."
Isaiah,9,4,"You will break the yoke  that burdens them,
the bar that is across their shoulders,
and the stick used by their oppressor,
as ⌞you did in the battle against⌟ Midian."
Isaiah,9,5,"Every warrior’s boot marching to the sound of battle
and every garment rolled in blood
will be burned as fuel in the fire."
Isaiah,9,6,"A child will be born for us.
A son will be given to us.
The government will rest on his shoulders.
He will be named:
Wonderful Counselor,
Mighty God,
Everlasting Father,
Prince of Peace."
Isaiah,9,7,"His government and peace will have unlimited growth.
He will establish David’s throne and kingdom.
He will uphold it with justice and righteousness now and forever.
The LORD of Armies is determined to do this!"
Isaiah,9,8,"The LORD sent a message against Jacob.
The message is against Israel."
Isaiah,9,9,"All the people of Ephraim
and the people who live in Samaria will know it.
With arrogant and conceited hearts they will say"
Isaiah,9,10,"“Bricks have fallen,
but we will rebuild with hand-cut stones.
Fig trees have been cut down,
but we will replace them with cedars.”"
Isaiah,9,11,"The LORD will set Rezin’s oppressors against Israel
and will stir up its enemies"
Isaiah,9,12,"the Arameans from the east and the Philistines from the west.
They will devour Israel with open mouths.
Even after all this, his anger will not disappear,
and he is still ready to use his power."
Isaiah,9,13,"But the people have not returned to the one who struck them,
nor have they sought the LORD of Armies."
Isaiah,9,14,"So in one day the LORD will cut off from Israel
both head and tail,
both palm branches and cattails."
Isaiah,9,15,"Respected and honored leaders are the head.
Prophets who teach lies are the tail."
Isaiah,9,16,"Those who guide these people lead them astray.
Those who are guided by them will be destroyed."

Isaiah,36,1,"In Hezekiah’s fourteenth year as king, King Sennacherib of Assyria attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them."
Isaiah,36,2,Then the king of Assyria sent his field commander with a large army from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. He stood at the channel for the Upper Pool on the road to Laundryman’s Field.
Isaiah,36,3,"Eliakim, who was in charge of the palace and was the son of Hilkiah, Shebna the scribe, and Joah, who was the royal historian and the son of Asaph, went out to the field commander."
Isaiah,36,4,"The field commander said to them, “Tell Hezekiah, ‘This is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: What makes you so confident?"
Isaiah,36,5,"You give useless advice about getting ready for war. Whom, then, do you trust for support in your rebellion against me?"
Isaiah,36,6,"Look! When you trust Egypt, you’re trusting a broken stick for a staff. If you lean on it, it stabs your hand and goes through it. This is what Pharaoh (the king of Egypt) is like for everyone who trusts him."
Isaiah,36,7,"Suppose you tell me, “We’re trusting the LORD our God.” He’s the god whose places of worship and altars Hezekiah got rid of. Hezekiah told Judah and Jerusalem, “Worship at this altar.” ’"
Isaiah,36,8,"“Now, make a deal with my master, the king of Assyria. I’ll give you 2,000 horses if you can put riders on them."
Isaiah,36,9,How can you defeat my master’s lowest-ranking officers when you trust Egypt for chariots and horses?
Isaiah,36,10,"“Have I come to destroy this country without the LORD on my side? The LORD said to me, ‘Attack this country, and destroy it.’ ”"
Isaiah,36,11,"Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to the field commander, “Speak to us in Aramaic, since we understand it. Don’t speak to us in the Judean language as long as there are people on the wall listening.”"
Isaiah,36,12,"But the field commander asked, “Did my master send me to tell these things only to you and your master? Didn’t he send me to the men sitting on the wall who will have to eat their own excrement and drink their own urine with you?”"
Isaiah,36,13,"Then the field commander stood and shouted loudly in the Judean language, “Listen to the great king, the king of Assyria."
Isaiah,36,14,This is what the king says: Don’t let Hezekiah deceive you. He can’t rescue you.
Isaiah,36,15,"Don’t let Hezekiah get you to trust the LORD by saying, ‘The LORD will certainly rescue us, and this city will not be put under the control of the king of Assyria.’"
Isaiah,36,16,"Don’t listen to Hezekiah, because this is what the king of Assyria says: Make peace with me! Come out, and give yourselves up to me! Everyone will eat from his own grapevine and fig tree and drink from his own cistern."
Isaiah,36,17,"Then I will come and take you away to a country like your own. It’s a country with grain and new wine, a country with bread and vineyards."
Isaiah,36,18,"Don’t let Hezekiah mislead you by saying to you, ‘The LORD will rescue us.’ Did any of the gods of the nations rescue their countries from the king of Assyria?"
Isaiah,36,19,Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Did they rescue Samaria from my control?
Isaiah,36,20,Did the gods of these countries rescue them from my control? Could the LORD then rescue Jerusalem from my control?”
Isaiah,36,21,They were silent and didn’t say anything to him because the king commanded them not to answer him.
Isaiah,36,22,"Then Eliakim, who was in charge of the palace and was son of Hilkiah, Shebna the scribe, and Joah, who was the royal historian and the son of Asaph, went to Hezekiah with their clothes torn in grief. They told him the message from the field commander."
Isaiah,37,1,"When King Hezekiah heard the message, he tore his clothes in grief, covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the LORD’s temple."
Isaiah,37,2,"Then he sent Eliakim, who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the scribe, and the leaders of the priests, clothed in sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz."
Isaiah,37,3,"They said to him, “This is what Hezekiah says: Today is a day filled with misery, punishment, and disgrace. We are like a woman who is about to give birth but doesn’t have the strength to do it."
Isaiah,37,4,"The LORD your God may have heard the words of the field commander. His master, the king of Assyria, sent him to defy the living God. The LORD your God may punish him because of the message that the LORD your God heard. Pray for the few people who are left.”"
Isaiah,37,5,So King Hezekiah’s men went to Isaiah.
Isaiah,37,6,"Isaiah answered them, “Say this to your master, ‘This is what the LORD says: Don’t be afraid of the message that you heard when the Assyrian king’s assistants slandered me."
Isaiah,37,7,I’m going to put a spirit in him so that he will hear a rumor and return to his own country. I’ll have him assassinated in his own country.’ ”
Isaiah,37,8,The field commander returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah. He had heard that the king left Lachish.
Isaiah,37,9,"Now, Sennacherib heard that King Tirhakah of Sudan was coming to fight him.
When he heard this, he again sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying"
Isaiah,37,10,"“Tell King Hezekiah of Judah, ‘Don’t let the god whom you trust deceive you by saying that Jerusalem will not be put under the control of the king of Assyria."
Isaiah,37,11,"You heard what the kings of Assyria did to all countries, how they totally destroyed them. Will you be rescued?"
Isaiah,37,12,"Did the gods of the nations which my ancestors destroyed rescue Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Telassar?"
Isaiah,37,13,"Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, and the king of the cities of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?’ ”"
Isaiah,37,14,"Hezekiah took the letter from the messengers, read it, and went to the LORD’s temple. He spread it out in front of the LORD"
Isaiah,37,15,and prayed to the LORD
Isaiah,37,16,"“LORD of Armies, God of Israel, you are enthroned over the angels. You alone are God of the kingdoms of the world. You made heaven and earth."
Isaiah,37,17,"Turn your ear toward me, LORD, and listen. Open your eyes, LORD, and see. Listen to the entire message that Sennacherib sent to defy the living God."
Isaiah,37,18,"It is true, LORD, that the kings of Assyria have leveled every country."
Isaiah,37,19,They have thrown the gods from these countries into fires because these gods aren’t real gods. They’re only wooden and stone statues made by human hands. So the Assyrians have destroyed them.
Isaiah,37,20,"Now, LORD our God, rescue us from Assyria’s control so that all the kingdoms on earth will know that you alone are the LORD.”"
Isaiah,37,21,"Then Isaiah, son of Amoz, sent a message to Hezekiah, “This is what the LORD God of Israel says: You prayed to me about King Sennacherib of Assyria."
Isaiah,37,22,"This is the message that the LORD speaks to him,
‘My dear people in Zion despise you and laugh at you.
My people in Jerusalem shake their heads behind your back."
Isaiah,37,23,"Whom are you defying and slandering?
Against whom are you shouting?
Who are you looking at so arrogantly?
It is the Holy One of Israel!"
Isaiah,37,24,"Through your servants you defy the Lord and say,
“With my many chariots I’ll ride up the high mountains,
up the slopes of Lebanon.
I’ll cut down its tallest cedars and its finest cypresses.
I’ll come to its most distant heights
and its most fertile forests."
Isaiah,37,25,"I’ll dig wells and drink water.
I’ll dry up all the streams of Egypt
with the trampling of my feet.”"
Isaiah,37,26,"“ ‘Haven’t you heard? I did this long ago.
I planned it in the distant past.
Now I make it happen so that you will turn fortified cities
into piles of rubble."
Isaiah,37,27,"Those who live in these cities are weak, discouraged, and ashamed.
They will be like plants in the field,
like fresh, green grass on the roofs,
dried up by the east wind."
Isaiah,37,28,"I know when you ⌞get up⌟ and sit down,
when you go out and come in,

and he will divide the prize with the strong,
because he poured out his life in death
and he was counted with sinners.
He carried the sins of many.
He intercedes for those who are rebellious."

You’ve gone to offer sacrifices there."
Isaiah,57,8,"You’ve set up your idols beside doors and doorposts.

You’ve made a deal with those you have pleasure with in bed.
You’ve seen them naked."

so you didn’t faint."

but they won’t help you."
Isaiah,57,13,"When you cry for help,
let your collection of idols save you.
A wind will carry them all away.
A breath will take them away.

“Build a road! Build a road!
Prepare the way!
Remove every obstacle in the way of my people!”"

I will renew the spirit of those who are humble
and the courage of those who are crushed."

I will not be angry with you forever.
Otherwise, the spirits, the lives of those I’ve made,

Raise your voice like a ram’s horn.
Tell my people about their rebellion
and the descendants of Jacob about their sins."
Isaiah,58,2,"They look for me every day and want to know my ways.
They act as if they were a nation that has done what is right
and as if they haven’t disregarded God’s judgment ⌞on them⌟.
They ask me for just decrees.
They want God to be near them."
Isaiah,58,3,"Why have we fasted if you are not aware of it?
Why have we inflicted pain on ourselves if you don’t pay attention?
Don’t you see that on the days you fast,
you do what you want to do?
You mistreat all your workers."
Isaiah,58,4,"Don’t you see that when you fast,
you quarrel and fight and beat your workers?
The way you fast today keeps you from being heard in heaven."
Isaiah,58,5,"Is this the kind of fasting I have chosen?
Should people humble themselves for ⌞only⌟ a day?
Is fasting just bowing your head like a cattail
and making your bed from sackcloth and ashes?
Is this what you call fasting?
Is this an acceptable day to the LORD?"
Isaiah,58,6,"This is the kind of fasting I have chosen:
Loosen the chains of wickedness,
untie the straps of the yoke,
let the oppressed go free,
and break every yoke."
Isaiah,58,7,"Share your food with the hungry,
take the poor and homeless into your house,
and cover them with clothes when you see ⌞them⌟ naked.

You will cry for help, and he will say, “Here I am!”
Get rid of that yoke.
Don’t point your finger and say wicked things."
Isaiah,58,10,"If you give some of your own food to ⌞feed⌟ those who are hungry
and to satisfy ⌞the needs of⌟ those who are humble,
then your light will rise in the dark,
and your darkness will become as bright as the noonday sun."

and restore the foundations of past generations.
You will be called the Rebuilder of Broken Walls
and the Restorer of Streets Where People Live."

and doing as you please on my holy day,
if you call the day of rest a delight
and the LORD’s holy day honorable,
if you honor it by not going your own way,
by not going out when you want, and by not talking idly"
Isaiah,58,14,"then you will find joy in the LORD.
I will make you ride on the heights of the earth.
I will feed you with the inheritance of your ancestor Jacob.
The LORD has spoken."
Isaiah,59,1,"The LORD is not too weak to save
or his ear too deaf to hear."
Isaiah,59,2,"But your wrongs have separated you from your God,
and your sins have made him hide his face
so that he doesn’t hear you."
Isaiah,59,3,"Your hands are stained with blood,
and your fingers are stained with sin.
You speak lies,
and you mutter wicked things."
Isaiah,59,4,"No one calls for justice,
and no one pleads his case truthfully.
People trust pointless arguments and speak lies.
They conceive trouble and give birth to evil."
Isaiah,59,5,"They hatch viper eggs
and weave spiderwebs.
Those who eat their eggs will die.
When an egg is crushed, a poisonous snake is hatched."
Isaiah,59,6,"Their webs can’t be used for clothes,
nor can they cover themselves with their works.
Their works are evil.
Their hands have committed acts of violence."
Isaiah,59,7,"Their feet run to do evil.
They hurry to shed innocent blood.
Their plans are evil.
Ruin and destruction are on their highways."
Isaiah,59,8,"They don’t know the way of peace.
There’s no justice on their highways.
They’ve made their paths crooked.
Whoever walks on them will never know peace."
Isaiah,59,9,"That is why justice is far from us,
and righteousness doesn’t reach us.
We hope for light, but we walk in darkness.
We hope for brightness, but we walk in gloom."

We grope like people without eyes.
We stumble at noon as if it were twilight.

Our sins testify against us.
Our rebellious acts are with us.
We know our wrongdoings."

We have turned away from our God.
We have spoken about oppression and revolt.
We have conceived and uttered lies in our hearts."
Isaiah,59,14,"Justice is turned back,
and righteousness stands far away.
Truth has fallen in the street,
and honesty can’t come in."
Isaiah,59,15,"Truth is missing.
Those who turn away from evil make themselves victims.
The LORD sees it, and he’s angry
because there’s no justice."
Isaiah,59,16,"He sees that there’s no one to help.
He’s astounded that there’s no one to intercede.
So with his own power he wins a victory.
His righteousness supports him."
Isaiah,59,17,"He puts on righteousness like a coat of armor
and a helmet of salvation on his head.
He wears clothes of vengeance.
He wraps himself with fury as a coat."
