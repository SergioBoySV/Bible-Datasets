In the streets swords kill my children.
Inside the houses it’s like death."
Lamentations,1,21,"“All my enemies have heard that I am groaning.
No one offers me comfort.
All my enemies have heard about my disaster.
They are happy that you did it.
You have allowed the day to come, the one that you had announced.

He handed the walls of Zion’s palaces over to its enemies.
The enemies made noise in the LORD’s temple
as though it were a festival day."

He marked it off with a line.
He didn’t take his hand away until he had swallowed it up.
He made the towers and walls mourn.
They are completely dejected."
Lamentations,2,9,"“⌞Zion’s⌟ gates have sunk into the ground.

What parallel can I show you, people of Jerusalem?
What comparison can I make that will comfort you, beloved people of Zion?
Your wounds are as deep as the sea.
Who can heal you?"
Lamentations,2,14,"Your prophets saw misleading visions about you.
They painted a good picture of you.
They didn’t expose your guilt in order to make things better again.
They gave you false prophecies that misled you."

They hiss and shake their heads at Jerusalem’s people:
‘Is this the city they used to call absolutely beautiful,
the joy of the whole world?’"

They hiss and grit their teeth.
They say, ‘We’ve swallowed it up.
Yes, this is the day we’ve been waiting for.
At last we have seen it!’"
Lamentations,2,17,"The LORD has accomplished what he had planned to do.
He carried out the threat he announced long ago.
He tore you down without any pity, ⌞Jerusalem⌟.
He made your enemies gloat over you.
He raised the weapons of your opponents."

cried out to the LORD, the wall of Zion’s people.
Let your tears run down like a river day and night.
Don’t let them stop.
Don’t let your eyes rest."

Lift up your hands to him ⌞in prayer⌟
for the life of your little children
who faint from hunger at every street corner.”"
Lamentations,2,20,"“O LORD, look and consider:
Have you ever treated anyone like this?
Should women eat their own children,
the children they have nursed?
Should priests and prophets be killed in the Lord’s holy place?"
Lamentations,2,21,"Young and old lie on the ground in the streets.
My young women and men are cut down by swords.
You killed them on the day of your anger.
You slaughtered them without any pity."
