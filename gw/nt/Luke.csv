Luke,1,1,Many have attempted to write about what had taken place among us.
Luke,1,2,"They received their information from those who had been eyewitnesses and servants of God’s word from the beginning, and they passed it on to us."
Luke,1,3,"I, too, have followed everything closely from the beginning. So I thought it would be a good idea to write an orderly account for Your Excellency, Theophilus."
Luke,1,4,In this way you will know that what you’ve been told is true.
Luke,1,5,"When Herod was king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the division of priests named after Abijah. Zechariah’s wife Elizabeth was a descendant of Aaron."
Luke,1,6,Zechariah and Elizabeth had God’s approval. They followed all the Lord’s commands and regulations perfectly.
Luke,1,7,"Yet, they never had any children because Elizabeth couldn’t become pregnant. Both of them were too old to have children."
Luke,1,8,Zechariah was on duty with his division of priests. As he served in God’s presence
Luke,1,9,he was chosen by priestly custom to go into the Lord’s temple to burn incense.
Luke,1,10,All the people were praying outside while he was burning incense.
Luke,1,11,"Then, to the right of the incense altar, an angel of the Lord appeared to him."
Luke,1,12,Zechariah was troubled and overcome with fear.
Luke,1,13,"The angel said to him, “Don’t be afraid, Zechariah! God has heard your prayer. Your wife Elizabeth will have a son, and you will name him John."
Luke,1,14,"He will be your pride and joy, and many people will be glad that he was born."
Luke,1,15,"As far as the Lord is concerned, he will be a great man. He will never drink wine or any other liquor. He will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born."
Luke,1,16,He will bring many people in Israel back to the Lord their God.
Luke,1,17,He will go ahead of the Lord with the spirit and power that Elijah had. He will change parents’ attitudes toward their children. He will change disobedient people so that they will accept the wisdom of those who have God’s approval. In this way he will prepare the people for their Lord.”
Luke,1,18,"Zechariah said to the angel, “What proof is there for this? I’m an old man, and my wife is beyond her childbearing years.”"
Luke,1,19,"The angel answered him, “I’m Gabriel! I stand in God’s presence. God sent me to tell you this good news."
Luke,1,20,"But because you didn’t believe what I said, you will be unable to talk until the day this happens. Everything will come true at the right time.”"
Luke,1,21,"Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah. They were amazed that he was staying in the temple so long."
Luke,1,22,"When he did come out, he was unable to speak to them. So they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple. He motioned to them but remained unable to talk."
Luke,1,23,"When the days of his service were over, he went home."
Luke,1,24,"Later, his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and didn’t go out in public for five months. She said"
Luke,1,25,“The Lord has done this for me now. He has removed my public disgrace.”
Luke,1,26,"Six months after Elizabeth had become pregnant, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a city in Galilee."
Luke,1,27,The angel went to a virgin promised in marriage to a descendant of David named Joseph. The virgin’s name was Mary.
Luke,1,28,"When the angel entered her home, he greeted her and said, “You are favored by the Lord! The Lord is with you.”"
Luke,1,29,She was startled by what the angel said and tried to figure out what this greeting meant.
Luke,1,30,"The angel told her,
“Don’t be afraid, Mary. You have found favor  with God."
Luke,1,31,"You will become pregnant, give birth to a son,
and name him Jesus."
Luke,1,32,"He will be a great man
and will be called the Son of the Most High.
The Lord God will give him
the throne of his ancestor David."
Luke,1,33,"Your son will be king of Jacob’s people forever,
and his kingdom will never end.”"
Luke,1,34,"Mary asked the angel, “How can this be? I’m a virgin.”"
Luke,1,35,"The angel answered her, “The Holy Spirit will come to you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore, the holy child developing inside you will be called the Son of God."
Luke,1,36,"“Elizabeth, your relative, is six months pregnant with a son in her old age. People said she couldn’t have a child."
Luke,1,37,But nothing is impossible for God.”
Luke,1,38,"Mary answered, “I am the Lord’s servant. Let everything you’ve said happen to me.”
Then the angel left her."
Luke,1,39,"Soon afterward, Mary hurried to a city in the mountain region of Judah."
Luke,1,40,She entered Zechariah’s home and greeted Elizabeth.
Luke,1,41,"When Elizabeth heard the greeting, she felt the baby kick. Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit."
Luke,1,42,"She said in a loud voice, “You are the most blessed of all women, and blessed is the child that you will have."
Luke,1,43,I feel blessed that the mother of my Lord is visiting me.
Luke,1,44,"As soon as I heard your greeting, I felt the baby jump for joy."
Luke,1,45,You are blessed for believing that the Lord would keep his promise to you.”
Luke,1,46,"Mary said,
“My soul praises the Lord’s greatness!"
Luke,1,47,"My spirit finds its joy in God, my Savior"
Luke,1,48,"because he has looked favorably on me, his humble servant.
“From now on, all people will call me blessed"
Luke,1,49,"because the Almighty has done great things to me.
His name is holy."
Luke,1,50,"For those who fear him,
his mercy lasts throughout every generation."
Luke,1,51,"“He displayed his mighty power.
He scattered those who think too highly of themselves."
Luke,1,52,"He pulled strong rulers from their thrones.
He honored humble people."
Luke,1,53,"He fed hungry people with good food.
He sent rich people away with nothing."
Luke,1,54,“He remembered to help his servant Israel forever.
Luke,1,55,"This is the promise he made to our ancestors,
to Abraham and his descendants.”"
Luke,1,56,Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months and then went back home.
Luke,1,57,"When the time came for Elizabeth to have her child, she gave birth to a son."
Luke,1,58,"Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had been very kind to her, and they shared her joy."
Luke,1,59,"When the child was eight days old, they went ⌞to the temple⌟ to circumcise him. They were going to name him Zechariah after his father."
Luke,1,60,"But his mother spoke up, “Absolutely not! His name will be John.”"
Luke,1,61,"Their friends said to her, “But you don’t have any relatives with that name.”"
Luke,1,62,So they motioned to the baby’s father to see what he wanted to name the child.
Luke,1,63,"Zechariah asked for a writing tablet and wrote, “His name is John.” Everyone was amazed."
Luke,1,64,"Suddenly, Zechariah was able to speak, and he began to praise God."
Luke,1,65,"All their neighbors were filled with awe. Throughout the mountain region of Judea, people talked about everything that had happened."
Luke,1,66,"Everyone who heard about it seriously thought it over and asked, “What does the future hold for this child?” It was clear that the Lord was with him."
Luke,1,67,His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied
Luke,1,68,"“Praise the Lord God of Israel!
He has come to take care of his people
and to set them free."
Luke,1,69,"He has raised up a mighty Savior for us
in the family of his servant David."
Luke,1,70,He made this promise through his holy prophets long ago.
Luke,1,71,"He promised to save us from our enemies
and from the power of all who hate us."
Luke,1,72,"He has shown his mercy to our ancestors
and remembered his holy promise"
Luke,1,73,the oath that he swore to our ancestor Abraham.
Luke,1,74,"He promised to rescue us from our enemies’ power
so that we could serve him without fear"
Luke,1,75,by being holy and honorable as long as we live.
Luke,1,76,"“You, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High.
You will go ahead of the Lord to prepare his way."
Luke,1,77,"You will make his people know that they can be saved
through the forgiveness of their sins."
Luke,1,78,"A new day will dawn on us from above
because our God is loving and merciful."
Luke,1,79,"He will give light to those who live in the dark
and in death’s shadow.
He will guide us into the way of peace.”"
Luke,1,80,The child John grew and became spiritually strong. He lived in the desert until the day he appeared to the people of Israel.
Luke,2,1,At that time the Emperor Augustus ordered a census of the Roman Empire.
Luke,2,2,This was the first census taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria.
Luke,2,3,All the people went to register in the cities where their ancestors had lived.
Luke,2,4,"So Joseph went from Nazareth, a city in Galilee, to a Judean city called Bethlehem. Joseph, a descendant of King David, went to Bethlehem because David had been born there."
Luke,2,5,Joseph went there to register with Mary. She had been promised to him in marriage and was pregnant.
Luke,2,6,"While they were in Bethlehem, the time came for Mary to have her child."
Luke,2,7,She gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger because there wasn’t any room for them in the inn.
Luke,2,8,Shepherds were in the fields near Bethlehem. They were taking turns watching their flock during the night.
Luke,2,9,"An angel from the Lord suddenly appeared to them. The glory of the Lord filled the area with light, and they were terrified."
Luke,2,10,"The angel said to them, “Don’t be afraid! I have good news for you, a message that will fill everyone with joy."
Luke,2,11,"Today your Savior, Christ the Lord, was born in David’s city."
Luke,2,12,This is how you will recognize him: You will find an infant wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in a manger.”
Luke,2,13,"Suddenly, a large army of angels appeared with the angel. They were praising God by saying"
Luke,2,14,"“Glory to God in the highest heaven,
and on earth peace to those who have his good will!”"
Luke,2,15,"The angels left them and went back to heaven. The shepherds said to each other, “Let’s go to Bethlehem and see what the Lord has told us about.”"
Luke,2,16,"They went quickly and found Mary and Joseph with the baby, who was lying in a manger."
Luke,2,17,"When they saw the child, they repeated what they had been told about him."
Luke,2,18,Everyone who heard the shepherds’ story was amazed.
Luke,2,19,Mary treasured all these things in her heart and always thought about them.
Luke,2,20,"As the shepherds returned to their flock, they glorified and praised God for everything they had seen and heard. Everything happened the way the angel had told them."
Luke,2,21,"Eight days after his birth, the child was circumcised and named Jesus. This was the name the angel had given him before his mother became pregnant."
Luke,2,22,"After the days required by Moses’ Teachings to make a mother clean  had passed, Joseph and Mary went to Jerusalem. They took Jesus to present him to the Lord."
Luke,2,23,They did exactly what was written in the Lord’s Teachings: “Every firstborn boy is to be set apart as holy to the Lord.”
Luke,2,24,They also offered a sacrifice as required by the Lord’s Teachings: “a pair of mourning doves or two young pigeons.”
Luke,2,25,A man named Simeon was in Jerusalem. He lived an honorable and devout life. He was waiting for the one who would comfort Israel. The Holy Spirit was with Simeon
Luke,2,26,"and had told him that he wouldn’t die until he had seen the Messiah, whom the Lord would send."
Luke,2,27,"Moved by the Spirit, Simeon went into the temple courtyard. Mary and Joseph were bringing the child Jesus into the courtyard at the same time. They brought him so that they could do for him what Moses’ Teachings required."
Luke,2,28,Then Simeon took the child in his arms and praised God by saying
Luke,2,29,"“Now, Lord, you are allowing your servant to leave in peace
as you promised."
Luke,2,30,My eyes have seen your salvation
Luke,2,31,which you have prepared for all people to see.
Luke,2,32,"He is a light that will reveal ⌞salvation⌟ to the nations
and bring glory to your people Israel.”"
Luke,2,33,Jesus’ father and mother were amazed at what was said about him.
Luke,2,34,"Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother, “This child is the reason that many people in Israel will be condemned and many others will be saved. He will be a sign that will expose"
Luke,2,35,the thoughts of those who reject him. And a sword will pierce your heart.”
Luke,2,36,"Anna, a prophet, was also there. She was a descendant of Phanuel from the tribe of Asher. She was now very old. Her husband had died seven years after they were married"
Luke,2,37,and she had been a widow for 84 years. Anna never left the temple courtyard but worshiped day and night by fasting and praying.
Luke,2,38,At that moment she came up to Mary and Joseph and began to thank God. She spoke about Jesus to all who were waiting for Jerusalem to be set free.
Luke,2,39,"After doing everything the Lord’s Teachings required, Joseph and Mary returned to their hometown of Nazareth in Galilee."
Luke,2,40,"The child grew and became strong. He was filled with wisdom, and God’s favor  was with him."
Luke,2,41,Every year Jesus’ parents would go to Jerusalem for the Passover festival.
Luke,2,42,"When he was 12 years old, they went as usual."
Luke,2,43,"When the festival was over, they left for home. The boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but his parents didn’t know it."
Luke,2,44,"They thought that he was with the others who were traveling with them. After traveling for a day, they started to look for him among their relatives and friends."
Luke,2,45,"When they didn’t find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him."
Luke,2,46,"Three days later, they found him in the temple courtyard. He was sitting among the teachers, listening to them, and asking them questions."
Luke,2,47,His understanding and his answers stunned everyone who heard him.
Luke,2,48,"When his parents saw him, they were shocked. His mother asked him, “Son, why have you done this to us? Your father and I have been worried sick looking for you!”"
Luke,2,49,"Jesus said to them, “Why were you looking for me? Didn’t you realize that I had to be in my Father’s house?”"
Luke,2,50,But they didn’t understand what he meant.
Luke,2,51,"Then he returned with them to Nazareth and was obedient to them.
His mother treasured all these things in her heart."
Luke,2,52,Jesus grew in wisdom and maturity. He gained favor from God and people.
Luke,3,1,"It was the fifteenth year in the reign of the Emperor Tiberius. Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea. Herod ruled Galilee, and his brother Philip ruled Iturea and Trachonitis. Lysanias was the ruler of Abilene."
Luke,3,2,"It was at the time when Annas and Caiaphas were chief priests that God spoke to John, son of Zechariah, in the desert."
Luke,3,3,John traveled throughout the region around the Jordan River. He told people about a baptism of repentance  for the forgiveness of sins.
Luke,3,4,"As the prophet Isaiah wrote in his book,
“A voice cries out in the desert:
‘Prepare the way for the Lord!
Make his paths straight!"
Luke,3,5,"Every valley will be filled.
Every mountain and hill will be leveled.
The crooked ways will be made straight.
The rough roads will be made smooth."
Luke,3,6,All people will see the salvation that God gives.’ ”
Luke,3,7,"Crowds of people were coming to be baptized by John. He would say to them, “You poisonous snakes! Who showed you how to flee from God’s coming anger?"
Luke,3,8,"Do those things that prove that you have turned to God and have changed the way you think and act. Don’t say, ‘Abraham is our ancestor.’ I guarantee that God can raise up descendants for Abraham from these stones."
Luke,3,9,The ax is now ready to cut the roots of the trees. Any tree that doesn’t produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into a fire.”
Luke,3,10,"The crowds asked him, “What should we do?”"
Luke,3,11,"He answered them, “Whoever has two shirts should share with the person who doesn’t have any. Whoever has food should share it too.”"
Luke,3,12,"Some tax collectors came to be baptized. They asked him, “Teacher, what should we do?”"
Luke,3,13,"He told them, “Don’t collect more money than you are ordered to collect.”"
Luke,3,14,"Some soldiers asked him, “And what should we do?”
He told them, “Be satisfied with your pay, and never use threats or blackmail to get money from anyone.”"
Luke,3,15,People’s hopes were rising as they all wondered whether John was the Messiah.
Luke,3,16,"John replied to all of them, “I baptize you with water. But the one who is more powerful than I is coming. I am not worthy to untie his sandal straps. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire."
Luke,3,17,"His winnowing  shovel is in his hand to clean up his threshing floor. He will gather the wheat into his barn, but he will burn the husks in a fire that can never be put out.”"
Luke,3,18,"With many other encouraging words, he told the Good News to the people."
Luke,3,19,"John spoke out against the ruler Herod because Herod had married his own sister-in-law, Herodias. He also spoke out against Herod for all the evil things he had done."
Luke,3,20,So Herod added one more evil to all the others; he locked John in prison.
Luke,3,21,"When all the people were baptized, Jesus, too, was baptized. While he was praying, heaven opened"
Luke,3,22,"and the Holy Spirit came down to him in the form of a dove. A voice from heaven said, “You are my Son, whom I love. I am pleased with you.”"
Luke,3,23,"Jesus was about 30 years old when he began ⌞his ministry⌟.
Jesus, so people thought, was the son of Joseph, son of Eli"
Luke,3,24,"son of Matthat, son of Levi, son of Melchi, son of Jannai, son of Joseph"
Luke,3,25,"son of Mattathias, son of Amos, son of Nahum, son of Esli, son of Naggai"
Luke,3,26,"son of Maath, son of Mattathias, son of Semein, son of Josech, son of Joda"
Luke,3,27,"son of Joanan, son of Rhesa, son of Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, son of Neri"
Luke,3,28,"son of Melchi, son of Addi, son of Cosam, son of Elmadam, son of Er"
Luke,3,29,"son of Joshua, son of Eliezer, son of Jorim, son of Matthat, son of Levi"
Luke,3,30,"son of Simeon, son of Judah, son of Joseph, son of Jonam, son of Eliakim"
Luke,3,31,"son of Melea, son of Menna, son of Mattatha, son of Nathan, son of David"
Luke,3,32,"son of Jesse, son of Obed, son of Boaz, son of Salmon, son of Nahshon"
Luke,3,33,"son of Amminadab, son of Admin, son of Arni, son of Hezron, son of Perez, son of Judah"
Luke,3,34,"son of Jacob, son of Isaac, son of Abraham, son of Terah, son of Nahor"
Luke,3,35,"son of Serug, son of Reu, son of Peleg, son of Eber, son of Shelah"
Luke,3,36,"son of Cainan, son of Arphaxad, son of Shem, son of Noah, son of Lamech"
Luke,3,37,"son of Methuselah, son of Enoch, son of Jared, son of Mahalaleel, son of Cainan"
Luke,3,38,"son of Enos, son of Seth,
son of Adam,
son of God."
Luke,4,1,Jesus was filled with the Holy Spirit as he left the Jordan River. The Spirit led him while he was in the desert
Luke,4,2,"where he was tempted by the devil for 40 days. During those days Jesus ate nothing, so when they were over, he was hungry."
Luke,4,3,"The devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become a loaf of bread.”"
Luke,4,4,"Jesus answered him, “Scripture says, ‘A person cannot live on bread alone.’ ”"
Luke,4,5,The devil took him to a high place and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in an instant.
Luke,4,6,"The devil said to him, “I will give you all the power and glory of these kingdoms. All of it has been given to me, and I give it to anyone I please."
Luke,4,7,"So if you will worship me, all this will be yours.”"
Luke,4,8,"Jesus answered him, “Scripture says, ‘Worship the Lord your God and serve only him.’ ”"
Luke,4,9,"Then the devil took him into Jerusalem and had him stand on the highest part of the temple. He said to Jesus, “If you are the Son of God, jump from here!"
Luke,4,10,"Scripture says, ‘He will put his angels in charge of you to watch over you carefully."
Luke,4,11,They will carry you in their hands so that you never hit your foot against a rock.’ ”
Luke,4,12,"Jesus answered him, “It has been said, ‘Never tempt the Lord your God.’ ”"
Luke,4,13,"After the devil had finished tempting Jesus in every possible way, the devil left him until another time."
Luke,4,14,"Jesus returned to Galilee. The power of the Spirit was with him, and the news about him spread throughout the surrounding country."
Luke,4,15,"He taught in the synagogues, and everyone praised him."
Luke,4,16,"Then Jesus came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up. As usual he went into the synagogue on the day of rest—a holy day. He stood up to read the lesson."
Luke,4,17,The attendant gave him the book of the prophet Isaiah. He opened it and found the place where it read
Luke,4,18,"“The Spirit of the Lord is with me.
He has anointed me
to tell the Good News to the poor.
He has sent me 
to announce forgiveness to the prisoners of sin
and the restoring of sight to the blind,
to forgive those who have been shattered by sin"
Luke,4,19,to announce the year of the Lord’s favor.”
Luke,4,20,"Jesus closed the book, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. Everyone in the synagogue watched him closely."
Luke,4,21,"Then he said to them, “This passage came true today when you heard me read it.”"
Luke,4,22,"All the people spoke well of him. They were amazed to hear the gracious words flowing from his lips. They said, “Isn’t this Joseph’s son?”"
Luke,4,23,"So he said to them, “You’ll probably quote this proverb to me, ‘Doctor, cure yourself!’ and then say to me, ‘Do all the things in your hometown that we’ve heard you’ve done in Capernaum.’ ”"
Luke,4,24,"Then Jesus added, “I can guarantee this truth: A prophet isn’t accepted in his hometown."
Luke,4,25,"“I can guarantee this truth: There were many widows in Israel in Elijah’s time. It had not rained for three-and-a-half years, and the famine was severe everywhere in the country."
Luke,4,26,But God didn’t send Elijah to anyone except a widow at Zarephath in the territory of Sidon.
Luke,4,27,There were also many people with skin diseases in Israel in the prophet Elisha’s time. But God cured no one except Naaman from Syria.”
Luke,4,28,Everyone in the synagogue became furious when they heard this.
Luke,4,29,"Their city was built on a hill with a cliff. So they got up, forced Jesus out of the city, and led him to the cliff. They intended to throw him off of it."
Luke,4,30,But Jesus walked right by them and went away.
Luke,4,31,"Jesus went to Capernaum, a city in Galilee, and taught them on a day of rest—a holy day."
Luke,4,32,The people were amazed at his teachings because he spoke with authority.
Luke,4,33,"In the synagogue was a man possessed by a spirit, an evil demon. He shouted very loudly"
Luke,4,34,"“Oh, no! What do you want with us, Jesus from Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”"
Luke,4,35,"Jesus ordered the spirit, “Keep quiet, and come out of him!” The demon threw the man down in the middle of the synagogue and came out without hurting him."
Luke,4,36,"Everyone was stunned. They said to one another, “What kind of command is this? With authority and power he gives orders to evil spirits, and they come out.”"
Luke,4,37,So news about him spread to every place throughout the surrounding region.
Luke,4,38,Jesus left the synagogue and went to Simon’s house. Simon’s mother-in-law was sick with a high fever. They asked Jesus to help her.
Luke,4,39,"He bent over her, ordered the fever to leave, and it went away. She got up immediately and prepared a meal for them."
Luke,4,40,"When the sun was setting, everyone who had friends suffering from various diseases brought them to him. He placed his hands on each of them and cured them."
Luke,4,41,"Demons came out of many people, shouting, “You are the Son of God!” But Jesus ordered them not to speak. After all, they knew he was the Messiah."
Luke,4,42,"In the morning he went to a place where he could be alone. The crowds searched for him. When they came to him, they tried to keep him from leaving."
Luke,4,43,"But he said to them, “I have to tell the Good News about God’s kingdom in other cities also. That’s what I was sent to do.”"
Luke,4,44,So he spread his message in the synagogues of Judea.
Luke,5,1,One day Jesus was standing by the Sea of Galilee. The people crowded around him as they listened to God’s word.
Luke,5,2,Jesus saw two boats on the shore. The fishermen had stepped out of them and were washing their nets.
Luke,5,3,So Jesus got into the boat that belonged to Simon and asked him to push off a little from the shore. Then Jesus sat down and taught the crowd from the boat.
Luke,5,4,"When he finished speaking, he told Simon, “Take the boat into deep water, and lower your nets to catch some fish.”"
Luke,5,5,"Simon answered, “Teacher, we worked hard all night and caught nothing. But if you say so, I’ll lower the nets.”"
Luke,5,6,"After the men had done this, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to tear."
Luke,5,7,So they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. Their partners came and filled both boats until the boats nearly sank.
Luke,5,8,"When Simon Peter saw this, he knelt in front of Jesus and said, “Leave me, Lord! I’m a sinful person!”"
Luke,5,9,Simon and everyone who was with him were amazed to see the large number of fish they had caught.
Luke,5,10,"James and John, who were Zebedee’s sons and Simon’s partners, were also amazed.
Jesus told Simon, “Don’t be afraid. From now on you will catch people instead of fish.”"
Luke,5,11,"Simon and his partners brought the boats to shore, left everything, and followed Jesus."
Luke,5,12,"One day Jesus was in a city where there was a man covered with a serious skin disease. When the man saw Jesus, he bowed with his face to the ground. He begged Jesus, “Sir, if you want to, you can make me clean.”"
Luke,5,13,"Jesus reached out, touched him, and said, “I want to. So be clean!” Immediately, his skin disease went away."
Luke,5,14,"Jesus ordered him, “Don’t tell anyone. Instead, show yourself to the priest. Then offer the sacrifice as Moses commanded as proof to people that you are clean.”"
Luke,5,15,The news about Jesus spread even more. Large crowds gathered to hear him and have their diseases cured.
Luke,5,16,But he would go away to places where he could be alone for prayer.
Luke,5,17,"One day when Jesus was teaching, some Pharisees and experts in Moses’ Teachings were present. They had come from every village in Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem. Jesus had the power of the Lord to heal."
Luke,5,18,Some men brought a paralyzed man on a stretcher. They tried to take him into the house and put him in front of Jesus.
Luke,5,19,But they could not find a way to get him into the house because of the crowd. So they went up on the roof. They made an opening in the tiles and let the man down on his stretcher among the people. (They lowered him in front of Jesus.)
Luke,5,20,"When Jesus saw their faith, he said, “Sir, your sins are forgiven.”"
Luke,5,21,"The experts in Moses’ Teachings and the Pharisees thought, “Who is this man? He’s dishonoring God! Who besides God can forgive sins?”"
Luke,5,22,"Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said to them, “What are you thinking?"
Luke,5,23,"Is it easier to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’?"
Luke,5,24,"I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.” Then he said to the paralyzed man, “Get up, pick up your stretcher, and go home.”"
Luke,5,25,"The man immediately stood up in front of them and picked up the stretcher he had been lying on. Praising God, he went home."
Luke,5,26,"Everyone was amazed and praised God. They were filled with awe and said, “We’ve seen things today we can hardly believe!”"
Luke,5,27,"After that, Jesus left. He saw a tax collector named Levi sitting in a tax office. Jesus said to him, “Follow me!”"
Luke,5,28,"So Levi got up, left everything, and followed him."
Luke,5,29,Levi held a large reception at his home for Jesus. A huge crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them.
Luke,5,30,"The Pharisees and their experts in Moses’ Teachings complained to Jesus’ disciples. They asked, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?”"
Luke,5,31,"Jesus answered them, “Healthy people don’t need a doctor; those who are sick do."
Luke,5,32,"I’ve come to call sinners to change the way they think and act, not to call people who think they have God’s approval.”"
Luke,5,33,"They said to him, “John’s disciples frequently fast and say prayers, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees. But your disciples eat and drink.”"
Luke,5,34,"Jesus asked them, “Can you force wedding guests to fast while the groom is still with them?"
Luke,5,35,The time will come when the groom will be taken away from them. At that time they will fast.”
Luke,5,36,"He also used these illustrations: “No one tears a piece of cloth from a new coat to patch an old coat. Otherwise, the new cloth will tear the old. Besides, the patch from the new will not match the old."
Luke,5,37,"People don’t pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the new wine will make the skins burst. The wine will run out, and the skins will be ruined."
Luke,5,38,"Rather, new wine is to be poured into fresh skins."
Luke,5,39,"“No one who has been drinking old wine wants new wine. He says, ‘The old wine is better!’ ”"
Luke,6,1,"Once, on a day of rest—a holy day, Jesus was walking through some grainfields. His disciples were picking the heads of grain, removing the husks, and eating the grain."
Luke,6,2,"Some of the Pharisees asked, “Why are your disciples doing something that is not right to do on the day of rest—a holy day?”"
Luke,6,3,"Jesus answered them, “Haven’t you read what David did when he and his men were hungry?"
Luke,6,4,"Haven’t you read how he went into the house of God, ate the bread of the presence, and gave some of it to the men who were with him? He had no right to eat those loaves. Only the priests have that right.”"
Luke,6,5,"Then he added, “The Son of Man has authority over the day of rest—a holy day.”"
Luke,6,6,"On another day of rest—a holy day, Jesus went into a synagogue to teach. A man whose right hand was paralyzed was there."
Luke,6,7,"The experts in Moses’ Teachings and the Pharisees were watching Jesus closely. They wanted to see whether he would heal the man on the day of rest—a holy day, so that they could find a way to accuse him of doing something wrong."
Luke,6,8,"But Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he told the man with the paralyzed hand, “Get up, and stand in the center ⌞of the synagogue⌟!” The man got up and stood there."
Luke,6,9,"Then Jesus said to them, “I ask you—what is the right thing to do on a day of rest—a holy day: to do good or evil, to give a person his health or to destroy it?”"
Luke,6,10,"He looked around at all of them and then said to the man, “Hold out your hand.” The man did so, and his hand became normal again."
Luke,6,11,The experts in Moses’ Teachings and Pharisees were furious and began to discuss with each other what they could do to Jesus.
Luke,6,12,At that time Jesus went to a mountain to pray. He spent the whole night in prayer to God.
Luke,6,13,"When it was day, he called his disciples. He chose twelve of them and called them apostles."
Luke,6,14,"They were Simon (whom Jesus named Peter) and Simon’s brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew"
Luke,6,15,"Matthew, Thomas, James (son of Alphaeus), Simon (who was called the Zealot)"
Luke,6,16,"Judas (son of James), and Judas Iscariot (who became a traitor)."
Luke,6,17,"Jesus came down from the mountain with them and stood on a level place. A large crowd of his disciples and many other people were there. They had come from all over Judea, Jerusalem, and the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon."
Luke,6,18,They wanted to hear him and be cured of their diseases. Those who were tormented by evil spirits were cured.
Luke,6,19,The entire crowd was trying to touch him because power was coming from him and curing all of them.
Luke,6,20,"Jesus looked at his disciples and said,
“Blessed are those who are poor.
God’s kingdom is theirs."
Luke,6,21,"Blessed are those who are hungry.
They will be satisfied.
Blessed are those who are crying.
They will laugh."
Luke,6,22,"Blessed are you when people hate you, avoid you,
insult you, and slander you
because you are committed to the Son of Man."
Luke,6,23,"Rejoice then, and be very happy!
You have a great reward in heaven.
That’s the way their ancestors treated the prophets."
Luke,6,24,"“But how horrible it will be for those who are rich.
They have had their comfort."
Luke,6,25,"How horrible it will be for those who are well-fed.
They will be hungry.
How horrible it will be for those who are laughing.
They will mourn and cry."
Luke,6,26,"How horrible it will be for you
when everyone says nice things about you.
That’s the way their ancestors treated the false prophets."
Luke,6,27,“But I tell everyone who is listening: Love your enemies. Be kind to those who hate you.
Luke,6,28,Bless those who curse you. Pray for those who insult you.
Luke,6,29,"If someone strikes you on the cheek, offer the other cheek as well. If someone takes your coat, don’t stop him from taking your shirt."
Luke,6,30,"Give to everyone who asks you for something. If someone takes what is yours, don’t insist on getting it back."
Luke,6,31,“Do for other people everything you want them to do for you.
Luke,6,32,"“If you love those who love you, do you deserve any thanks for that? Even sinners love those who love them."
Luke,6,33,"If you help those who help you, do you deserve any thanks for that? Sinners do that too."
Luke,6,34,"If you lend anything to those from whom you expect to get something back, do you deserve any thanks for that? Sinners also lend to sinners to get back what they lend."
Luke,6,35,"Rather, love your enemies, help them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then you will have a great reward. You will be the children of the Most High God. After all, he is kind to unthankful and evil people."
Luke,6,36,Be merciful as your Father is merciful.
Luke,6,37,"“Stop judging, and you will never be judged. Stop condemning, and you will never be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven."
Luke,6,38,"Give, and you will receive. A large quantity, pressed together, shaken down, and running over will be put into your pocket. The standards you use for others will be applied to you.”"
Luke,6,39,Jesus also gave them this illustration: “Can one blind person lead another? Won’t both fall into the same pit?
Luke,6,40,A student is no better than his teacher. But everyone who is well-trained will be like his teacher.
Luke,6,41,“Why do you see the piece of sawdust in another believer’s eye and not notice the wooden beam in your own eye?
Luke,6,42,"How can you say to another believer, ‘Friend, let me take the piece of sawdust out of your eye,’ when you don’t see the beam in your own eye? You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye. Then you will see clearly to remove the piece of sawdust from another believer’s eye."
Luke,6,43,"“A good tree doesn’t produce rotten fruit, and a rotten tree doesn’t produce good fruit."
Luke,6,44,Each tree is known by its fruit. You don’t pick figs from thorny plants or grapes from a thornbush.
Luke,6,45,Good people do the good that is in them. But evil people do the evil that is in them. The things people say come from inside them.
Luke,6,46,“Why do you call me Lord but don’t do what I tell you?
Luke,6,47,"“I will show you what everyone who comes to me, hears what I say, and obeys it is like."
Luke,6,48,"He is like a person who dug down to bedrock to lay the foundation of his home. When a flood came, the floodwaters pushed against that house. But the house couldn’t be washed away because it had a good foundation."
Luke,6,49,"The person who hears ⌞what I say⌟ but doesn’t obey it is like someone who built a house on the ground without any foundation. The floodwaters pushed against it, and that house quickly collapsed and was destroyed.”"
Luke,7,1,"When Jesus had finished everything he wanted to say to the people, he went to Capernaum."
Luke,7,2,There a Roman army officer’s valuable slave was sick and near death.
Luke,7,3,The officer had heard about Jesus and sent some Jewish leaders to him. They were to ask Jesus to come and save the servant’s life.
Luke,7,4,"They came to Jesus and begged, “He deserves your help."
Luke,7,5,He loves our people and built our synagogue at his own expense.”
Luke,7,6,"Jesus went with them. He was not far from the house when the officer sent friends to tell Jesus, “Sir, don’t bother. I don’t deserve to have you come into my house."
Luke,7,7,"That’s why I didn’t come to you. But just give a command, and let my servant be cured."
Luke,7,8,"As you know, I’m in a chain of command and have soldiers at my command. I tell one of them, ‘Go!’ and he goes, and another, ‘Come!’ and he comes. I tell my servant, ‘Do this!’ and he does it.”"
Luke,7,9,"Jesus was amazed at the officer when he heard these words. He turned to the crowd following him and said, “I can guarantee that I haven’t found faith as great as this in Israel.”"
Luke,7,10,"When the men who had been sent returned to the house, they found the servant healthy again."
Luke,7,11,"Soon afterward, Jesus went to a city called Nain. His disciples and a large crowd went with him."
Luke,7,12,"As he came near the entrance to the city, he met a funeral procession. The dead man was a widow’s only child. A large crowd from the city was with her."
Luke,7,13,"When the Lord saw her, he felt sorry for her. He said to her, “Don’t cry.”"
Luke,7,14,"He went up to the open coffin, took hold of it, and the men who were carrying it stopped. He said, “Young man, I’m telling you to come back to life!”"
Luke,7,15,"The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother."
Luke,7,16,"Everyone was struck with fear and praised God. They said, “A great prophet has appeared among us,” and “God has taken care of his people.”"
Luke,7,17,This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding region.
Luke,7,18,John’s disciples told him about all these things. Then John called two of his disciples
Luke,7,19,"and sent them to ask the Lord, “Are you the one who is coming, or should we look for someone else?”"
Luke,7,20,"The men came to Jesus and said, “John the Baptizer sent us to ask you, ‘Are you the one who is coming, or should we look for someone else?’ ”"
Luke,7,21,"At that time Jesus was curing many people who had diseases, sicknesses, and evil spirits. Also, he was giving back sight to many who were blind."
Luke,7,22,"Jesus answered John’s disciples, “Go back, and tell John what you have seen and heard: Blind people see again, lame people are walking, those with skin diseases are made clean, deaf people hear again, dead people are brought back to life, and poor people hear the Good News."
Luke,7,23,Whoever doesn’t lose his faith in me is indeed blessed.”
Luke,7,24,"When John’s messengers had left, Jesus spoke to the crowds about John. “What did you go into the desert to see? Tall grass swaying in the wind?"
Luke,7,25,"Really, what did you go to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? Those who wear splendid clothes and live in luxury are in royal palaces."
Luke,7,26,"Really, what did you go to see? A prophet? Let me tell you that he is far more than a prophet."
Luke,7,27,"John is the one about whom Scripture says,
‘I am sending my messenger ahead of you
to prepare the way in front of you.’"
Luke,7,28,"I can guarantee that of all the people ever born, no one is greater than John. Yet, the least important person in God’s kingdom is greater than John."
Luke,7,29,"“All the people, including tax collectors, heard John. They admitted that God was right by letting John baptize them."
Luke,7,30,But the Pharisees and the experts in Moses’ Teachings rejected God’s plan for them. They refused to be baptized.
Luke,7,31,“How can I describe the people who are living now? What are they like?
Luke,7,32,"They are like children who sit in the marketplace and shout to each other,
‘We played music for you,
but you didn’t dance.
We sang a funeral song,
but you didn’t cry.’"
Luke,7,33,"John the Baptizer has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, ‘There’s a demon in him!’"
Luke,7,34,"The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Look at him! He’s a glutton and a drunk, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’"
Luke,7,35,"“Yet, wisdom is proved right by all its results.”"
Luke,7,36,One of the Pharisees invited Jesus to eat with him. Jesus went to the Pharisee’s house and was eating at the table.
Luke,7,37,A woman who lived a sinful life in that city found out that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee’s house. So she took a bottle of perfume
Luke,7,38,"and knelt at his feet. She was crying and washed his feet with her tears. Then she dried his feet with her hair, kissed them over and over again, and poured the perfume on them."
Luke,7,39,"The Pharisee who had invited Jesus saw this and thought, “If this man really were a prophet, he would know what sort of woman is touching him. She’s a sinner.”"
Luke,7,40,"Jesus spoke up, “Simon, I have something to say to you.”
Simon replied, “Teacher, you’re free to speak.”"
Luke,7,41,"⌞So Jesus said,⌟ “Two men owed a moneylender some money. One owed him five hundred silver coins, and the other owed him fifty."
Luke,7,42,"When they couldn’t pay it back, he was kind enough to cancel their debts. Now, who do you think will love him the most?”"
Luke,7,43,"Simon answered, “I suppose the one who had the largest debt canceled.”
Jesus said to him, “You’re right!”"
Luke,7,44,"Then, turning to the woman, he said to Simon, “You see this woman, don’t you? I came into your house. You didn’t wash my feet. But she has washed my feet with her tears and dried them with her hair."
Luke,7,45,"You didn’t give me a kiss. But ever since I came in, she has not stopped kissing my feet."
Luke,7,46,You didn’t put any olive oil on my head. But she has poured perfume on my feet.
Luke,7,47,That’s why I’m telling you that her many sins have been forgiven. Her great love proves that. But whoever receives little forgiveness loves very little.”
Luke,7,48,"Then Jesus said to her, “Your sins have been forgiven.”"
Luke,7,49,"The other guests thought, “Who is this man who even forgives sins?”"
Luke,7,50,"Jesus said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you. Go in peace!”"
Luke,8,1,"After this, Jesus traveled from one city and village to another. He spread the Good News about God’s kingdom. The twelve apostles were with him."
Luke,8,2,"Also, some women were with him. They had been cured from evil spirits and various illnesses. These women were Mary, also called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out"
Luke,8,3,"Joanna, whose husband Chusa was Herod’s administrator; Susanna; and many other women. They provided financial support for Jesus and his disciples."
Luke,8,4,"When a large crowd had gathered and people had come to Jesus from every city, he used this story as an illustration"
Luke,8,5,"“A farmer went to plant his seeds. Some seeds were planted along the road, were trampled, and were devoured by birds."
Luke,8,6,"Others were planted on rocky soil. When the plants came up, they withered because they had no moisture."
Luke,8,7,Others were planted among thornbushes. The thornbushes grew up with them and choked them.
Luke,8,8,"Others were planted on good ground. When they came up, they produced a hundred times as much as was planted.”
After he had said this, he called out, “Let the person who has ears listen!”"
Luke,8,9,His disciples asked him what this story meant.
Luke,8,10,"Jesus answered, “Knowledge about the mysteries of God’s kingdom has been given ⌞directly⌟ to you. But it is given to others in stories. When they look, they don’t see, and when they hear, they don’t understand."
Luke,8,11,“This is what the story illustrates: The seed is God’s word.
Luke,8,12,"Some people are like seeds that were planted along the road. They hear the word, but then the devil comes. He takes the word away from them so that they don’t believe and become saved."
Luke,8,13,"Some people are like seeds on rocky soil. They welcome the word with joy whenever they hear it, but they don’t develop any roots. They believe for a while, but when their faith is tested, they abandon it."
Luke,8,14,"The seeds that were planted among thornbushes are people who hear the word, but as life goes on the worries, riches, and pleasures of life choke them. So they don’t produce anything good."
Luke,8,15,The seeds that were planted on good ground are people who also hear the word. But they keep it in their good and honest hearts and produce what is good despite what life may bring.
Luke,8,16,"“No one lights a lamp and hides it under a bowl or puts it under a bed. Instead, everyone who lights a lamp puts it on a lamp stand so that those who come in will see the light."
Luke,8,17,There is nothing hidden that will not be revealed. There is nothing kept secret that will not come to light.
Luke,8,18,"“So pay attention to how you listen! Those who understand ⌞these mysteries⌟ will be given ⌞more knowledge⌟. However, some people don’t understand ⌞these mysteries⌟. Even what they think they understand will be taken away from them.”"
Luke,8,19,His mother and his brothers came to see him. But they couldn’t meet with him because of the crowd.
Luke,8,20,"Someone told Jesus, “Your mother and your brothers are standing outside. They want to see you.”"
Luke,8,21,"He answered them, “My mother and my brothers are those who hear and do what God’s word says.”"
Luke,8,22,"One day Jesus and his disciples got into a boat. He said to them, “Let’s cross to the other side of the lake.” So they started out."
Luke,8,23,"As they were sailing along, Jesus fell asleep.
A violent storm came across the lake. The boat was taking on water, and they were in danger."
Luke,8,24,"They went to him, woke him up, and said, “Master! Master! We’re going to die!”
Then he got up and ordered the wind and the waves to stop. The wind stopped, and the sea became calm."
Luke,8,25,"He asked them, “Where is your faith?”
Frightened and amazed, they asked each other, “Who is this man? He gives orders to the wind and the water, and they obey him!”"
Luke,8,26,They landed in the region of the Gerasenes across from Galilee.
Luke,8,27,"When Jesus stepped out on the shore, a certain man from the city met him. The man was possessed by demons and had not worn clothes for a long time. He would not stay in a house but lived in the tombs."
Luke,8,28,"When he saw Jesus, he shouted, fell in front of him, and said in a loud voice, “Why are you bothering me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you not to torture me!”"
Luke,8,29,Jesus ordered the evil spirit to come out of the man. (The evil spirit had controlled the man for a long time. People had kept him under guard. He was chained hand and foot. But he would break the chains. Then the demon would force him to go into the desert.)
Luke,8,30,"Jesus asked him, “What is your name?”
He answered, “Legion [Six Thousand].” (Many demons had entered him.)"
Luke,8,31,The demons begged Jesus not to order them to go into the bottomless pit.
Luke,8,32,A large herd of pigs was feeding on a mountainside. The demons begged Jesus to let them enter those pigs. So he let them do this.
Luke,8,33,The demons came out of the man and went into the pigs. Then the herd rushed down the cliff into the lake and drowned.
Luke,8,34,"When those who had taken care of the pigs saw what had happened, they ran away. They reported everything in the city and countryside."
Luke,8,35,"The people went to see what had happened. They came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone out. Dressed and in his right mind, he was sitting at Jesus’ feet. The people were frightened."
Luke,8,36,Those who had seen this told the people how Jesus had restored the demon-possessed man to health.
Luke,8,37,"Then all the people from the surrounding region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave because they were terrified.
Jesus got into a boat and started back."
Luke,8,38,"The man from whom the demons had gone out begged him, “Let me go with you.”
But Jesus sent the man away and told him"
Luke,8,39,"“Go home to your family, and tell them how much God has done for you.” So the man left. He went through the whole city and told people how much Jesus had done for him."
Luke,8,40,"When Jesus came back, a crowd welcomed him. Everyone was expecting him."
Luke,8,41,"A man named Jairus, a synagogue leader, arrived and quickly bowed down in front of Jesus. He begged Jesus to come to his home."
Luke,8,42,"His only daughter, who was about twelve years old, was dying. As Jesus went, the people were crowding around him."
Luke,8,43,A woman who had been suffering from chronic bleeding for twelve years was in the crowd. No one could cure her.
Luke,8,44,"She came up behind Jesus, touched the edge of his clothes, and her bleeding stopped at once."
Luke,8,45,"Jesus asked, “Who touched me?”
After everyone denied touching him, Peter said, “Teacher, the people are crowding you and pressing against you.”"
Luke,8,46,"Jesus said, “Someone touched me. I know power has gone out of me.”"
Luke,8,47,"The woman saw that she couldn’t hide. Trembling, she quickly bowed in front of him. There, in front of all the people, she told why she touched him and how she was cured at once."
Luke,8,48,"Jesus told her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace!”"
Luke,8,49,"While Jesus was still speaking to her, someone came from the synagogue leader’s home. He said, “Your daughter is dead. Don’t bother the teacher anymore.”"
Luke,8,50,"When Jesus heard this, he told the synagogue leader, “Don’t be afraid! Just believe, and she will get well.”"
Luke,8,51,"Jesus went into the house. He allowed no one to go with him except Peter, John, James, and the child’s parents."
Luke,8,52,"Everyone was crying and showing how sad they were. Jesus said, “Don’t cry! She’s not dead. She’s just sleeping.”"
Luke,8,53,They laughed at him because they knew she was dead.
Luke,8,54,"But Jesus took her hand and called out, “Child, get up!”"
Luke,8,55,She came back to life and got up at once. He ordered her parents to give her something to eat.
Luke,8,56,They were amazed. Jesus ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened.
Luke,9,1,Jesus called the twelve apostles together and gave them power and authority over every demon and power and authority to cure diseases.
Luke,9,2,He sent them to spread the message about God’s kingdom and to cure the sick.
Luke,9,3,"He told them, “Don’t take anything along on the trip. Don’t take a walking stick, traveling bag, any food, money, or a change of clothes."
Luke,9,4,"When you go into a home, stay there until you’re ready to leave."
Luke,9,5,"If people don’t welcome you, leave that city, and shake its dust off your feet as a warning to them.”"
Luke,9,6,"The apostles went from village to village, told the Good News, and cured the sick everywhere."
Luke,9,7,Herod the ruler heard about everything that was happening. He didn’t know what to make of it. Some people were saying that John had come back to life.
Luke,9,8,"Others said that Elijah had appeared, and still others said that one of the prophets from long ago had come back to life."
Luke,9,9,"Herod said, “I had John’s head cut off. Who is this person I’m hearing so much about?” So Herod wanted to see Jesus."
Luke,9,10,The apostles came back and told Jesus everything they had done. He took them with him to a city called Bethsaida so that they could be alone.
Luke,9,11,"But the crowds found out about this and followed him. He welcomed them, talked to them about God’s kingdom, and cured those who were sick."
Luke,9,12,"Toward the end of the day, the twelve apostles came to him. They said to him, “Send the crowd to the closest villages and farms so that they can find some food and a place to stay. No one lives around here.”"
Luke,9,13,"Jesus replied, “You give them something to eat.”
They said to him, “We have five loaves of bread and two fish. Unless we go to buy food for all these people, that’s all we have.”"
Luke,9,14,"(There were about five thousand men.)
Then he told his disciples, “Have them sit in groups of about fifty.”"
Luke,9,15,So they did this.
Luke,9,16,"Then he took the five loaves and the two fish, looked up to heaven, and blessed the food. He broke the loaves apart and kept giving them to the disciples to give to the crowd."
Luke,9,17,"All of them ate as much as they wanted. When they picked up the leftover pieces, they filled twelve baskets."
Luke,9,18,"Once when Jesus was praying privately and his disciples were with him, he asked them, “Who do people say I am?”"
Luke,9,19,"They answered, “Some say you are John the Baptizer, others Elijah, and still others say that one of the prophets from long ago has come back to life.”"
Luke,9,20,"He asked them, “But who do you say I am?”
Peter answered, “You are the Messiah, whom God has sent.”"
Luke,9,21,He ordered them not to tell this to anyone.
Luke,9,22,"Jesus said that the Son of Man would have to suffer a lot. He would be rejected by the leaders, the chief priests, and the experts in Moses’ Teachings. He would be killed, but on the third day he would come back to life."
Luke,9,23,"He said to all of them, “Those who want to come with me must say no to the things they want, pick up their crosses every day, and follow me."
Luke,9,24,Those who want to save their lives will lose them. But those who lose their lives for me will save them.
Luke,9,25,What good does it do for people to win the whole world but lose their lives by destroying them?
Luke,9,26,"If people are ashamed of me and what I say, the Son of Man will be ashamed of those people when he comes in the glory that he shares with the Father and the holy angels."
Luke,9,27,“I can guarantee this truth: Some people who are standing here will not die until they see God’s kingdom.”
Luke,9,28,"About eight days after he had said this, Jesus took Peter, John, and James with him and went up a mountain to pray."
Luke,9,29,"While Jesus was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became dazzling white."
Luke,9,30,"Suddenly, both Moses and Elijah were talking with him."
Luke,9,31,They appeared in heavenly glory and were discussing Jesus’ approaching death and what he was about to fulfill in Jerusalem.
Luke,9,32,"Peter and the men with him were sleeping soundly. When they woke up, they saw Jesus’ glory and the two men standing with him."
Luke,9,33,"As Moses and Elijah were leaving him, Peter said to Jesus, “Teacher, it’s good that we’re here. Let’s put up three tents—one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” Peter didn’t know what he was saying."
Luke,9,34,"While he was saying this, a cloud overshadowed them. They were frightened as they went into the cloud."
Luke,9,35,"A voice came out of the cloud and said, “This is my Son, whom I have chosen. Listen to him!”"
Luke,9,36,"After the voice had spoken, they saw that Jesus was alone. The disciples said nothing, and for some time they told no one about what they had seen."
Luke,9,37,"The next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a large crowd met Jesus."
Luke,9,38,"A man in the crowd shouted, “Teacher, I beg you to look at my son. He’s my only child."
Luke,9,39,"Whenever a spirit takes control of him, he shrieks, goes into convulsions, and foams at the mouth. After a struggle, the spirit goes away, leaving the child worn out."
Luke,9,40,"I begged your disciples to force the spirit out of him, but they couldn’t do it.”"
Luke,9,41,"Jesus answered, “You unbelieving and corrupt generation! How long must I be with you and put up with you? Bring your son here!”"
Luke,9,42,"While he was coming ⌞to Jesus⌟, the demon knocked the boy to the ground and threw him into convulsions.
Jesus ordered the evil spirit to leave. He cured the boy and gave him back to his father."
Luke,9,43,"Everyone was amazed to see God’s wonderful power.
Everyone was amazed at all the things that Jesus was doing. So he said to his disciples"
Luke,9,44,“Listen carefully to what I say. The Son of Man will be betrayed and handed over to people.”
Luke,9,45,"They didn’t know what he meant. The meaning was hidden from them so that they didn’t understand it. Besides, they were afraid to ask him about what he had said."
Luke,9,46,A discussion started among them about who would be the greatest.
Luke,9,47,Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he took a little child and had him stand beside him.
Luke,9,48,"Then he said to them, “Whoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me. Whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. The one who is least among all of you is the one who is greatest.”"
Luke,9,49,"John replied, “Master, we saw someone forcing demons out of a person by using the power and authority of your name. We tried to stop him because he was not one of us.”"
Luke,9,50,"Jesus said to him, “Don’t stop him! Whoever isn’t against you is for you.”"
Luke,9,51,The time was coming closer for Jesus to be taken to heaven. So he was determined to go to Jerusalem.
Luke,9,52,He sent messengers ahead of him. They went into a Samaritan village to arrange a place for him to stay.
Luke,9,53,"But the people didn’t welcome him, because he was on his way to Jerusalem."
Luke,9,54,"James and John, his disciples, saw this. They asked, “Lord, do you want us to call down fire from heaven to burn them up?”"
Luke,9,55,But he turned and corrected them.
Luke,9,56,So they went to another village.
Luke,9,57,"As they were walking along the road, a man said to Jesus, “I’ll follow you wherever you go.”"
Luke,9,58,"Jesus told him, “Foxes have holes, and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to sleep.”"
Luke,9,59,"He told another man, “Follow me!”
But the man said, “Sir, first let me go to bury my father.”"
Luke,9,60,"But Jesus told him, “Let the dead bury their own dead. You must go everywhere and tell about God’s kingdom.”"
Luke,9,61,"Another said, “I’ll follow you, sir, but first let me tell my family goodbye.”"
Luke,9,62,"Jesus said to him, “Whoever starts to plow and looks back is not fit for God’s kingdom.”"
Luke,10,1,"After this, the Lord appointed 70  other disciples to go ahead of him to every city and place that he intended to go. They were to travel in pairs."
Luke,10,2,"He told them, “The harvest is large, but the workers are few. So ask the Lord who gives this harvest to send workers to harvest his crops."
Luke,10,3,Go! I’m sending you out like lambs among wolves.
Luke,10,4,"Don’t carry a wallet, a traveling bag, or sandals, and don’t stop to greet anyone on the way."
Luke,10,5,"Whenever you go into a house, greet the family right away with the words, ‘May there be peace in this house.’"
Luke,10,6,"If a peaceful person lives there, your greeting will be accepted. But if that’s not the case, your greeting will be rejected."
Luke,10,7,"Stay with the family that accepts you. Eat and drink whatever they offer you. After all, the worker deserves his pay. Do not move around from one house to another."
Luke,10,8,"Whenever you go into a city and the people welcome you, eat whatever they serve you."
Luke,10,9,"Heal the sick that are there, and tell the people, ‘God’s kingdom is near you!’"
Luke,10,10,"“But whenever you go into a city and people don’t welcome you, leave. Announce in its streets"
Luke,10,11,‘We are wiping your city’s dust from our feet in protest against you! But realize that God’s kingdom is near you!’
Luke,10,12,I can guarantee that judgment day will be easier for Sodom than for that city.
Luke,10,13,"“How horrible it will be for you, Chorazin! How horrible it will be for you, Bethsaida! If the miracles worked in your cities had been worked in Tyre and Sidon, they would have changed the way they thought and acted. Long ago they would have worn sackcloth and sat in ashes."
Luke,10,14,Judgment day will be better for Tyre and Sidon than for you.
Luke,10,15,"And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted to heaven? No, you will go to hell!"
Luke,10,16,"“The person who hears you hears me, and the person who rejects you rejects me. The person who rejects me rejects the one who sent me.”"
Luke,10,17,"The 70 disciples came back very happy. They said, “Lord, even demons obey us when we use the power and authority of your name!”"
Luke,10,18,"Jesus said to them, “I watched Satan fall from heaven like lightning."
Luke,10,19,I have given you the authority to trample snakes and scorpions and to destroy the enemy’s power. Nothing will hurt you.
Luke,10,20,"However, don’t be happy that evil spirits obey you. Be happy that your names are written in heaven.”"
Luke,10,21,"In that hour the Holy Spirit filled Jesus with joy. Jesus said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for hiding these things from wise and intelligent people and revealing them to little children. Yes, Father, this is what pleased you."
Luke,10,22,“My Father has turned everything over to me. Only the Father knows who the Son is. And no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son is willing to reveal him.”
Luke,10,23,"He turned to his disciples in private and said to them, “How blessed you are to see what you’ve seen."
Luke,10,24,"I can guarantee that many prophets and kings wanted to see and hear what you’ve seen and heard, but they didn’t.”"
Luke,10,25,"Then an expert in Moses’ Teachings stood up to test Jesus. He asked, “Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”"
Luke,10,26,"Jesus answered him, “What is written in Moses’ Teachings? What do you read there?”"
Luke,10,27,"He answered, “ ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind. And love your neighbor as you love yourself.’ ”"
Luke,10,28,"Jesus told him, “You’re right! Do this, and life will be yours.”"
Luke,10,29,"But the man wanted to justify his question. So he asked Jesus, “Who is my neighbor?”"
Luke,10,30,"Jesus replied, “A man went from Jerusalem to Jericho. On the way robbers stripped him, beat him, and left him for dead."
Luke,10,31,"“By chance, a priest was traveling along that road. When he saw the man, he went around him and continued on his way."
Luke,10,32,"Then a Levite came to that place. When he saw the man, he, too, went around him and continued on his way."
Luke,10,33,"“But a Samaritan, as he was traveling along, came across the man. When the Samaritan saw him, he felt sorry for the man"
Luke,10,34,"went to him, and cleaned and bandaged his wounds. Then he put him on his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him."
Luke,10,35,"The next day the Samaritan took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper. He told the innkeeper, ‘Take care of him. If you spend more than that, I’ll pay you on my return trip.’"
Luke,10,36,"“Of these three men, who do you think was a neighbor to the man who was attacked by robbers?”"
Luke,10,37,"The expert said, “The one who was kind enough to help him.”
Jesus told him, “Go and imitate his example!”"
Luke,10,38,"As they were traveling along, Jesus went into a village. A woman named Martha welcomed him into her home."
Luke,10,39,She had a sister named Mary. Mary sat at the Lord’s feet and listened to him talk.
Luke,10,40,"But Martha was upset about all the work she had to do. So she asked, “Lord, don’t you care that my sister has left me to do the work all by myself? Tell her to help me.”"
Luke,10,41,"The Lord answered her, “Martha, Martha! You worry and fuss about a lot of things."
Luke,10,42,"There’s only one thing you need. Mary has made the right choice, and that one thing will not be taken away from her.”"
Luke,11,1,"Once Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he stopped praying, one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray as John taught his disciples.”"
Luke,11,2,"Jesus told them, “When you pray, say this:
Father,
let your name be kept holy.
Let your kingdom come."
Luke,11,3,Give us our bread day by day.
Luke,11,4,"Forgive us as we forgive everyone else.
Don’t allow us to be tempted.”"
Luke,11,5,"Jesus said to his disciples, “Suppose one of you has a friend. Suppose you go to him at midnight and say, ‘Friend, let me borrow three loaves of bread."
Luke,11,6,"A friend of mine on a trip has dropped in on me, and I don’t have anything to serve him.’"
Luke,11,7,"Your friend might answer you from inside his house, ‘Don’t bother me! The door is already locked, and my children are in bed. I can’t get up to give you anything.’"
Luke,11,8,"I can guarantee that although he doesn’t want to get up to give you anything, he will get up and give you whatever you need because he is your friend and because you were so bold."
Luke,11,9,"“So I tell you to ask, and you will receive. Search, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened for you."
Luke,11,10,"Everyone who asks will receive. The one who searches will find, and for the person who knocks, the door will be opened."
Luke,11,11,"“If your child asks you, his father, for a fish, would you give him a snake instead?"
Luke,11,12,"Or if your child asks you for an egg, would you give him a scorpion?"
Luke,11,13,"Even though you’re evil, you know how to give good gifts to your children. So how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?”"
Luke,11,14,"Jesus was forcing a demon out of a man. The demon had made the man unable to talk. When the demon had gone out, the man began to talk.
The people were amazed."
Luke,11,15,"But some of them said, “He can force demons out of people only with the help of Beelzebul, the ruler of demons.”"
Luke,11,16,Others wanted to test Jesus and demanded that he show them some miraculous sign from heaven.
Luke,11,17,"Since Jesus knew what they were thinking, he said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is ruined. A house divided against itself falls."
Luke,11,18,"Now, if Satan is divided against himself, how can his kingdom last? I say this because you say Beelzebul helps me force demons out of people."
Luke,11,19,"If I force demons out with the help of Beelzebul, who helps your followers force them out? That’s why they will be your judges."
Luke,11,20,"But if I force out demons with the help of God’s power, then God’s kingdom has come to you."
Luke,11,21,"“When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own mansion, his property is safe."
Luke,11,22,But a stronger man than he may attack him and defeat him. Then the stronger man will take away all the weapons in which the strong man trusted and will divide the loot.
Luke,11,23,“Whoever isn’t with me is against me. Whoever doesn’t gather with me scatters.
Luke,11,24,"“When an evil spirit comes out of a person, it goes through dry places looking for a place to rest. But it doesn’t find any. Then it says, ‘I’ll go back to the home I left.’"
Luke,11,25,"When it comes, it finds the house swept clean and in order."
Luke,11,26,Then the spirit goes and brings along seven other spirits more evil than itself. They enter and take up permanent residence there. In the end the condition of that person is worse than it was before.”
Luke,11,27,"While Jesus was speaking, a woman in the crowd shouted, “How blessed is the mother who gave birth to you and the breasts that nursed you.”"
Luke,11,28,"Jesus replied, “Rather, how blessed are those who hear and obey God’s word.”"
Luke,11,29,"As the people were gathering around him, Jesus said, “The people living today are evil. They look for a miraculous sign. But the only sign they will get is the sign of Jonah."
Luke,11,30,"Just as Jonah became a miraculous sign to the people of Nineveh, so the Son of Man will be a miraculous sign to the people living today."
Luke,11,31,"The queen from the south will stand up at the time of judgment with the men who live today. She will condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear Solomon’s wisdom. But look, someone greater than Solomon is here!"
Luke,11,32,"The men of Nineveh will stand up at the time of judgment with the people living today. Since the men of Nineveh turned to God and changed the way they thought and acted when Jonah spoke his message, they will condemn the people living today. But look, someone greater than Jonah is here!"
Luke,11,33,"“No one lights a lamp and hides it or puts it under a basket. Instead, everyone who lights a lamp puts it on a lamp stand so that those who come in will see its light."
Luke,11,34,"“Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eye is unclouded, your whole body is full of light. But when your eye is evil, your body is full of darkness."
Luke,11,35,So be careful that the light in you isn’t darkness.
Luke,11,36,"If your whole body is full of light and not darkness, it will be as bright as a lamp shining on you.”"
Luke,11,37,"After Jesus spoke, a Pharisee invited him to have lunch at his house. So Jesus accepted the invitation."
Luke,11,38,The Pharisee was surprised to see that Jesus didn’t wash before the meal.
Luke,11,39,"The Lord said to him, “You Pharisees clean the outside of cups and dishes. But inside you are full of greed and evil."
Luke,11,40,You fools! Didn’t the one who made the outside make the inside too?
Luke,11,41,"Give what is inside as a gift to the poor, and then everything will be clean  for you."
Luke,11,42,"“How horrible it will be for you Pharisees! You give ⌞God⌟ one-tenth of your mint, spices, and every garden herb. But you have ignored justice and the love of God. You should have done these things without ignoring the others."
Luke,11,43,“How horrible it will be for you Pharisees! You love to sit in the front seats in the synagogues and to be greeted in the marketplaces.
Luke,11,44,How horrible it will be for you! You are like unmarked graves. People walk on them without knowing what they are.”
Luke,11,45,"One of the experts in Moses’ Teachings said to him, “Teacher, when you talk this way, you insult us too.”"
Luke,11,46,"Jesus said, “How horrible it will be for you experts in Moses’ Teachings! You burden people with loads that are hard to carry. But you won’t lift a finger to carry any of these loads."
Luke,11,47,“How horrible it will be for you! You build the monuments for the prophets. But it was your ancestors who murdered them.
Luke,11,48,So you are witnesses and approve of what your ancestors did. They murdered the prophets for whom you build monuments.
Luke,11,49,"That’s why the Wisdom of God said, ‘I will send them prophets and apostles. They will murder some of those prophets and apostles and persecute others.’"
Luke,11,50,So the people living now will be charged with the murder of every prophet since the world was made.
Luke,11,51,"This includes the murders from Abel to Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the temple. Yes, I can guarantee this truth: The people living today will be held responsible for this."
Luke,11,52,"“How horrible it will be for you experts in Moses’ Teachings! You have taken away the key that unlocks knowledge. You haven’t gained entrance into ⌞knowledge⌟ yourselves, and you’ve kept out those who wanted to enter.”"
Luke,11,53,"When Jesus left, the experts in Moses’ Teachings and the Pharisees held a terrible grudge against him. They questioned him about many things"
Luke,11,54,and watched him closely to trap him in something he might say.
Luke,12,1,"Meanwhile, thousands of people had gathered. They were so crowded that they stepped on each other. Jesus spoke to his disciples and said, “Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees. I’m talking about their hypocrisy."
Luke,12,2,Nothing has been covered that will not be exposed. Whatever is secret will be made known.
Luke,12,3,Whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight. Whatever you have whispered in private rooms will be shouted from the housetops.
Luke,12,4,"“My friends, I can guarantee that you don’t need to be afraid of those who kill the body. After that they can’t do anything more."
Luke,12,5,I’ll show you the one you should be afraid of. Be afraid of the one who has the power to throw you into hell after killing you. I’m warning you to be afraid of him.
Luke,12,6,“Aren’t five sparrows sold for two cents? God doesn’t forget any of them.
Luke,12,7,Even every hair on your head has been counted. Don’t be afraid! You are worth more than many sparrows.
Luke,12,8,I can guarantee that the Son of Man will acknowledge in front of God’s angels every person who acknowledges him in front of others.
Luke,12,9,But God’s angels will be told that I don’t know those people who tell others that they don’t know me.
Luke,12,10,Everyone who says something against the Son of Man will be forgiven. But the person who dishonors the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
Luke,12,11,"“When you are put on trial in synagogues or in front of rulers and authorities, don’t worry about how you will defend yourselves or what you will say."
Luke,12,12,At that time the Holy Spirit will teach you what you must say.”
Luke,12,13,"Someone in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to give me my share of the inheritance that our father left us.”"
Luke,12,14,"Jesus said to him, “Who appointed me to be your judge or to divide ⌞your inheritance⌟?”"
Luke,12,15,"He told the people, “Be careful to guard yourselves from every kind of greed. Life is not about having a lot of material possessions.”"
Luke,12,16,"Then he used this illustration. He said, “A rich man had land that produced good crops."
Luke,12,17,"He thought, ‘What should I do? I don’t have enough room to store my crops.’"
Luke,12,18,"He said, ‘I know what I’ll do. I’ll tear down my barns and build bigger ones so that I can store all my grain and goods in them."
Luke,12,19,"Then I’ll say to myself, “You’ve stored up a lot of good things for years to come. Take life easy, eat, drink, and enjoy yourself.” ’"
Luke,12,20,"“But God said to him, ‘You fool! I will demand your life from you tonight! Now who will get what you’ve accumulated?’"
Luke,12,21,That’s how it is when a person has material riches but is not rich in his relationship with God.”
Luke,12,22,"Then Jesus said to his disciples, “So I tell you to stop worrying about what you will eat or wear."
Luke,12,23,"Life is more than food, and the body is more than clothes."
Luke,12,24,"Consider the crows. They don’t plant or harvest. They don’t even have a storeroom or a barn. Yet, God feeds them. You are worth much more than birds."
Luke,12,25,“Can any of you add an hour to your life by worrying?
Luke,12,26,"If you can’t do a small thing like that, why worry about other things?"
Luke,12,27,Consider how the flowers grow. They never work or spin yarn for clothes. But I say that not even Solomon in all his majesty was dressed like one of these flowers.
Luke,12,28,"That’s the way God clothes the grass in the field. Today it’s alive, and tomorrow it’s thrown into an incinerator. So how much more will he clothe you people who have so little faith?"
Luke,12,29,"“Don’t concern yourself about what you will eat or drink, and quit worrying about these things."
Luke,12,30,"Everyone in the world is concerned about these things, but your Father knows you need them."
Luke,12,31,"Rather, be concerned about his kingdom. Then these things will be provided for you."
Luke,12,32,"Don’t be afraid, little flock. Your Father is pleased to give you the kingdom."
Luke,12,33,"“Sell your material possessions, and give the money to the poor. Make yourselves wallets that don’t wear out! Make a treasure for yourselves in heaven that never loses its value! In heaven thieves and moths can’t get close enough to destroy your treasure."
Luke,12,34,Your heart will be where your treasure is.
Luke,12,35,"“Be ready for action, and have your lamps burning."
Luke,12,36,Be like servants waiting to open the door at their master’s knock when he returns from a wedding.
Luke,12,37,"Blessed are those servants whom the master finds awake when he comes. I can guarantee this truth: He will change his clothes, make them sit down at the table, and serve them."
Luke,12,38,They will be blessed if he comes in the middle of the night or toward morning and finds them awake.
Luke,12,39,"“Of course, you realize that if the homeowner had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have let him break into his house."
Luke,12,40,"Be ready, because the Son of Man will return when you least expect him.”"
Luke,12,41,"Peter asked, “Lord, did you use this illustration just for us or for everyone?”"
Luke,12,42,"The Lord asked, “Who, then, is the faithful, skilled manager that the master will put in charge of giving the other servants their share of food at the right time?"
Luke,12,43,That servant will be blessed if his master finds him doing this job when he comes.
Luke,12,44,I can guarantee this truth: He will put that servant in charge of all his property.
Luke,12,45,"On the other hand, that servant may think that his master is taking a long time to come home. The servant may begin to beat the other servants and to eat, drink, and get drunk."
Luke,12,46,His master will return at an unexpected time. Then his master will punish him severely and assign him a place with unfaithful people.
Luke,12,47,“The servant who knew what his master wanted but didn’t get ready to do it will receive a hard beating.
Luke,12,48,But the servant who didn’t know ⌞what his master wanted⌟ and did things for which he deserved punishment will receive a light beating. A lot will be expected from everyone who has been given a lot. More will be demanded from everyone who has been entrusted with a lot.
Luke,12,49,“I have come to throw fire on the earth. I wish that it had already started!
Luke,12,50,"I have a baptism to go through, and I will suffer until it is over."
Luke,12,51,“Do you think I came to bring peace to earth? No! I can guarantee that I came to bring nothing but division.
Luke,12,52,From now on a family of five will be divided. Three will be divided against two and two against three.
Luke,12,53,A father will be against his son and a son against his father. A mother will be against her daughter and a daughter against her mother. A mother-in-law will be against her daughter-in-law and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.”
Luke,12,54,"Jesus said to the crowds, “When you see a cloud coming up in the west, you immediately say, ‘There’s going to be a rainstorm,’ and it happens."
Luke,12,55,"When you see a south wind blowing, you say, ‘It’s going to be hot,’ and that’s what happens."
Luke,12,56,You hypocrites! You can forecast the weather by judging the appearance of earth and sky. But for some reason you don’t know how to judge the time in which you’re living.
Luke,12,57,So why don’t you judge for yourselves what is right?
Luke,12,58,"For instance, when an opponent brings you to court in front of a ruler, do your best to settle with him before you get there. Otherwise, he will drag you in front of a judge. The judge will hand you over to an officer who will throw you into prison."
Luke,12,59,I can guarantee that you won’t get out until you pay every penny of your fine.”
Luke,13,1,At that time some people reported to Jesus about some Galileans whom Pilate had executed while they were sacrificing animals.
Luke,13,2,"Jesus replied to them, “Do you think that this happened to them because they were more sinful than other people from Galilee?"
Luke,13,3,"No! I can guarantee that they weren’t. But if you don’t turn to God and change the way you think and act, then you, too, will all die."
Luke,13,4,What about those 18 people who died when the tower at Siloam fell on them? Do you think that they were more sinful than other people living in Jerusalem?
Luke,13,5,"No! I can guarantee that they weren’t. But if you don’t turn to God and change the way you think and act, then you, too, will all die.”"
Luke,13,6,Then Jesus used this illustration: “A man had a fig tree growing in his vineyard. He went to look for fruit on the tree but didn’t find any.
Luke,13,7,"He said to the gardener, ‘For the last three years I’ve come to look for figs on this fig tree but haven’t found any. Cut it down! Why should it use up ⌞good⌟ soil?’"
Luke,13,8,"“The gardener replied, ‘Sir, let it stand for one more year. I’ll dig around it and fertilize it."
Luke,13,9,"Maybe next year it’ll have figs. But if not, then cut it down.’ ”"
Luke,13,10,Jesus was teaching in a synagogue on the day of rest—a holy day.
Luke,13,11,A woman who was possessed by a spirit was there. The spirit had disabled her for 18 years. She was hunched over and couldn’t stand up straight.
Luke,13,12,"When Jesus saw her, he called her to come to him and said, “Woman, you are free from your disability.”"
Luke,13,13,"He placed his hands on her, and she immediately stood up straight and praised God."
Luke,13,14,"The synagogue leader was irritated with Jesus for healing on the day of rest. The leader told the crowd, “There are six days when work can be done. So come on one of those days to be healed. Don’t come on the day of rest—a holy day.”"
Luke,13,15,"The Lord said, “You hypocrites! Don’t each of you free your ox or donkey on the day of rest—a holy day? Don’t you then take it out of its stall to give it some water to drink?"
Luke,13,16,"Now, here is a descendant of Abraham. Satan has kept her in this condition for 18 years. Isn’t it right to free her on the day of rest—a holy day?”"
Luke,13,17,"As he said this, everyone who opposed him felt ashamed. But the entire crowd was happy about the miraculous things he was doing."
Luke,13,18,"Jesus asked, “What is God’s kingdom like? What can I compare it to?"
Luke,13,19,"It’s like a mustard seed that someone planted in a garden. It grew and became a tree, and the birds nested in its branches.”"
Luke,13,20,"He asked again, “What can I compare God’s kingdom to?"
Luke,13,21,It’s like yeast that a woman mixed into a large amount of flour until the yeast worked its way through all the dough.”
Luke,13,22,Then Jesus traveled and taught in one city and village after another on his way to Jerusalem.
Luke,13,23,"Someone asked him, “Sir, are only a few people going to be saved?”
He answered"
Luke,13,24,"“Try hard to enter through the narrow door. I can guarantee that many will try to enter, but they won’t succeed."
Luke,13,25,"After the homeowner gets up and closes the door, ⌞it’s too late⌟. You can stand outside, knock at the door, and say, ‘Sir, open the door for us!’ But he will answer you, ‘I don’t know who you are.’"
Luke,13,26,"Then you will say, ‘We ate and drank with you, and you taught in our streets.’"
Luke,13,27,"But he will tell you, ‘I don’t know who you are. Get away from me, all you evil people.’"
Luke,13,28,"Then you will cry and be in extreme pain. That’s what you’ll do when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets. They’ll be in God’s kingdom, but you’ll be thrown out."
Luke,13,29,People will come from all over the world and will eat in God’s kingdom.
Luke,13,30,"Some who are last will be first, and some who are first will be last.”"
Luke,13,31,"At that time some Pharisees told Jesus, “Get out of here, and go somewhere else! Herod wants to kill you.”"
Luke,13,32,"Jesus said to them, “Tell that fox that I will force demons out of people and heal people today and tomorrow. I will finish my work on the third day."
Luke,13,33,"But I must be on my way today, tomorrow, and the next day. It’s not possible for a prophet to die outside Jerusalem."
Luke,13,34,"“Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you kill the prophets and stone to death those sent to you! How often I wanted to gather your children together the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings! But you were not willing!"
Luke,13,35,"Your house will be abandoned. I can guarantee that you will not see me again until you say, ‘Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!’ ”"
Luke,14,1,"On a day of rest—a holy day, Jesus went to eat at the home of a prominent Pharisee. The guests were watching Jesus very closely."
Luke,14,2,A man whose body was swollen with fluid was there.
Luke,14,3,"Jesus reacted by asking the Pharisees and the experts in Moses’ Teachings, “Is it right to heal on the day of rest—a holy day, or not?”"
Luke,14,4,"But they didn’t say a thing.
So Jesus took hold of the man, healed him, and sent him away."
Luke,14,5,"Jesus asked them, “If your son or your ox falls into a well on a day of rest—a holy day, wouldn’t you pull him out immediately?”"
Luke,14,6,They couldn’t argue with him about this.
Luke,14,7,Then Jesus noticed how the guests always chose the places of honor. So he used this illustration when he spoke to them
Luke,14,8,"“When someone invites you to a wedding, don’t take the place of honor. Maybe someone more important than you was invited."
Luke,14,9,"Then your host would say to you, ‘Give this person your place.’ Embarrassed, you would have to take the place of least honor."
Luke,14,10,"So when you’re invited, take the place of least honor. Then, when your host comes, he will tell you, ‘Friend, move to a more honorable place.’ Then all the other guests will see how you are honored."
Luke,14,11,"Those who honor themselves will be humbled, but people who humble themselves will be honored.”"
Luke,14,12,"Then he told the man who had invited him, “When you invite people for lunch or dinner, don’t invite only your friends, family, other relatives, or rich neighbors. Otherwise, they will return the favor."
Luke,14,13,"Instead, when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the handicapped, the lame, and the blind."
Luke,14,14,Then you will be blessed because they don’t have any way to pay you back. You will be paid back when those who have God’s approval come back to life.”
Luke,14,15,"One of those eating with him heard this. So he said to Jesus, “The person who will be at the banquet in God’s kingdom is blessed.”"
Luke,14,16,"Jesus said to him, “A man gave a large banquet and invited many people."
Luke,14,17,"When it was time for the banquet, he sent his servant to tell those who were invited, ‘Come! Everything is ready now.’"
Luke,14,18,"“Everyone asked to be excused. The first said to him, ‘I bought a field, and I need to see it. Please excuse me.’"
Luke,14,19,"Another said, ‘I bought five pairs of oxen, and I’m on my way to see how well they plow. Please excuse me.’"
Luke,14,20,"Still another said, ‘I recently got married, and that’s why I can’t come.’"
Luke,14,21,"“The servant went back to report this to his master. Then the master of the house became angry. He told his servant, ‘Run to every street and alley in the city! Bring back the poor, the handicapped, the blind, and the lame.’"
Luke,14,22,"“The servant said, ‘Sir, what you’ve ordered has been done. But there is still room for more people.’"
Luke,14,23,"“Then the master told his servant, ‘Go to the roads and paths! Urge the people to come to my house. I want it to be full."
Luke,14,24,I can guarantee that none of those invited earlier will taste any food at my banquet.’ ”
Luke,14,25,Large crowds were traveling with Jesus. He turned to them and said
Luke,14,26,"“If people come to me and are not ready to abandon their fathers, mothers, wives, children, brothers, and sisters, as well as their own lives, they cannot be my disciples."
Luke,14,27,So those who do not carry their crosses and follow me cannot be my disciples.
Luke,14,28,“Suppose you want to build a tower. You would first sit down and figure out what it costs. Then you would see if you have enough money to finish it.
Luke,14,29,"Otherwise, if you lay a foundation and can’t finish the building, everyone who watches will make fun of you."
Luke,14,30,"They’ll say, ‘This person started to build but couldn’t finish the job.’"
Luke,14,31,"“Or suppose a king is going to war against another king. He would first sit down and think things through. Can he and his 10,000 soldiers fight against a king with 20,000 soldiers?"
Luke,14,32,"If he can’t, he’ll send ambassadors to ask for terms of peace while the other king is still far away."
Luke,14,33,"In the same way, none of you can be my disciples unless you give up everything."
Luke,14,34,"“Salt is good. But if salt loses its taste, how will you restore its flavor?"
Luke,14,35,"It’s not any good for the ground or for the manure pile. People throw it away.
“Let the person who has ears listen!”"
Luke,15,1,All the tax collectors and sinners came to listen to Jesus.
Luke,15,2,"But the Pharisees and the experts in Moses’ Teachings complained, “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.”"
Luke,15,3,Jesus spoke to them using this illustration
Luke,15,4,“Suppose a man has 100 sheep and loses one of them. Doesn’t he leave the 99 sheep grazing in the pasture and look for the lost sheep until he finds it?
Luke,15,5,"When he finds it, he’s happy. He puts that sheep on his shoulders and"
Luke,15,6,"goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says to them, ‘Let’s celebrate! I’ve found my lost sheep!’"
Luke,15,7,I can guarantee that there will be more happiness in heaven over one person who turns to God and changes the way he thinks and acts than over 99 people who already have turned to God and have his approval.”
Luke,15,8,"“Suppose a woman has ten coins and loses one. Doesn’t she light a lamp, sweep the house, and look for the coin carefully until she finds it?"
Luke,15,9,"When she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together and says, ‘Let’s celebrate! I’ve found the coin that I lost.’"
Luke,15,10,So I can guarantee that God’s angels are happy about one person who turns to God and changes the way he thinks and acts.”
Luke,15,11,"Then Jesus said, “A man had two sons."
Luke,15,12,"The younger son said to his father, ‘Father, give me my share of the property.’ So the father divided his property between his two sons."
Luke,15,13,"“After a few days, the younger son gathered his possessions and left for a country far away from home. There he wasted everything he had on a wild lifestyle."
Luke,15,14,He had nothing left when a severe famine spread throughout that country. He had nothing to live on.
Luke,15,15,So he got a job from someone in that country and was sent to feed pigs in the fields.
Luke,15,16,"No one in the country would give him any food, and he was so hungry that he would have eaten what the pigs were eating."
Luke,15,17,"“Finally, he came to his senses. He said, ‘How many of my father’s hired men have more food than they can eat, while I’m starving to death here?"
Luke,15,18,"I’ll go at once to my father, and I’ll say to him, “Father, I’ve sinned against heaven and you."
Luke,15,19,I don’t deserve to be called your son anymore. Make me one of your hired men.” ’
Luke,15,20,"“So he went at once to his father. While he was still at a distance, his father saw him and felt sorry for him. He ran to his son, put his arms around him, and kissed him."
Luke,15,21,"Then his son said to him, ‘Father, I’ve sinned against heaven and you. I don’t deserve to be called your son anymore.’"
Luke,15,22,"“The father said to his servants, ‘Hurry! Bring out the best robe, and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet."
Luke,15,23,"Bring the fattened calf, kill it, and let’s celebrate with a feast."
Luke,15,24,My son was dead and has come back to life. He was lost but has been found.’ Then they began to celebrate.
Luke,15,25,"“His older son was in the field. As he was coming back to the house, he heard music and dancing."
Luke,15,26,He called to one of the servants and asked what was happening.
Luke,15,27,"“The servant told him, ‘Your brother has come home. So your father has killed the fattened calf to celebrate your brother’s safe return.’"
Luke,15,28,“Then the older son became angry and wouldn’t go into the house. His father came out and begged him to come in.
Luke,15,29,"But he answered his father, ‘All these years I’ve worked like a slave for you. I’ve never disobeyed one of your commands. Yet, you’ve never given me so much as a little goat for a celebration with my friends."
Luke,15,30,"But this son of yours spent your money on prostitutes, and when he came home, you killed the fattened calf for him.’"
Luke,15,31,"“His father said to him, ‘My child, you’re always with me. Everything I have is yours."
Luke,15,32,"But we have something to celebrate, something to be happy about. This brother of yours was dead but has come back to life. He was lost but has been found.’ ”"
Luke,16,1,"Then Jesus said to his disciples, “A rich man had a business manager. The manager was accused of wasting the rich man’s property."
Luke,16,2,"So the rich man called for his manager and said to him, ‘What’s this I hear about you? Let me examine your books. It’s obvious that you can’t manage my property any longer.’"
Luke,16,3,"“The manager thought, ‘What should I do? My master is taking my job away from me. I’m not strong enough to dig, and I’m ashamed to beg."
Luke,16,4,I know what I’ll do so that people will welcome me into their homes when I’ve lost my job.’
Luke,16,5,"“So the manager called for each one of his master’s debtors. He said to the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’"
Luke,16,6,"“The debtor replied, ‘Eight hundred gallons of olive oil.’
“The manager told him, ‘Take my master’s ledger. Quick! Sit down, and write “four hundred!” ’"
Luke,16,7,"“Then he asked another debtor, ‘How much do you owe?’
“The debtor replied, ‘A thousand bushels of wheat.’
“The manager told him, ‘Take the ledger, and write “eight hundred!” ’"
Luke,16,8,“The master praised the dishonest manager for being so clever. Worldly people are more clever than spiritually-minded people when it comes to dealing with others.”
Luke,16,9,"⌞Jesus continued,⌟ “I’m telling you that although wealth is often used in dishonest ways, you should use it to make friends for yourselves. When life is over, you will be welcomed into an eternal home."
Luke,16,10,Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with a lot. Whoever is dishonest with very little is dishonest with a lot.
Luke,16,11,"Therefore, if you can’t be trusted with wealth that is often used dishonestly, who will trust you with wealth that is real?"
Luke,16,12,"If you can’t be trusted with someone else’s wealth, who will give you your own?"
Luke,16,13,"“A servant cannot serve two masters. He will hate the first master and love the second, or he will be devoted to the first and despise the second. You cannot serve God and wealth.”"
Luke,16,14,"The Pharisees, who love money, heard all this and were making sarcastic remarks about him."
Luke,16,15,"So Jesus said to them, “You try to justify your actions in front of people. But God knows what’s in your hearts. What is important to humans is disgusting to God."
Luke,16,16,"“Moses’ Teachings and the Prophets were ⌞in force⌟ until the time of John. Since that time, people have been telling the Good News about God’s kingdom, and everyone is trying to force their way into it."
Luke,16,17,It is easier for the earth and the heavens to disappear than to drop a comma from the Scriptures.
Luke,16,18,“Any man who divorces his wife to marry another woman is committing adultery. The man who marries a woman divorced in this way is committing adultery.
Luke,16,19,“There was a rich man who wore expensive clothes. Every day was like a party to him.
Luke,16,20,There was also a beggar named Lazarus who was regularly brought to the gate of the rich man’s house.
Luke,16,21,"Lazarus would have eaten any scraps that fell from the rich man’s table. Lazarus was covered with sores, and dogs would lick them."
Luke,16,22,"“One day the beggar died, and the angels carried him to be with Abraham. The rich man also died and was buried."
Luke,16,23,"He went to hell, where he was constantly tortured. As he looked up, in the distance he saw Abraham and Lazarus."
Luke,16,24,"He yelled, ‘Father Abraham! Have mercy on me! Send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water to cool off my tongue. I am suffering in this fire.’"
Luke,16,25,"“Abraham replied, ‘Remember, my child, that you had a life filled with good times, while Lazarus’ life was filled with misery. Now he has peace here, while you suffer."
Luke,16,26,"Besides, a wide area separates us. People couldn’t cross it in either direction even if they wanted to.’"
Luke,16,27,"“The rich man responded, ‘Then I ask you, Father, to send Lazarus back to my father’s home."
Luke,16,28,I have five brothers. He can warn them so that they won’t end up in this place of torture.’
Luke,16,29,"“Abraham replied, ‘They have Moses’ ⌞Teachings⌟ and the Prophets. Your brothers should listen to them!’"
Luke,16,30,"“The rich man replied, ‘No, Father Abraham! If someone comes back to them from the dead, they will turn to God and change the way they think and act.’"
Luke,16,31,"“Abraham answered him, ‘If they won’t listen to Moses’ ⌞Teachings⌟ and the Prophets, they won’t be persuaded even if someone comes back to life.’ ”"
Luke,17,1,"Jesus told his disciples, “Situations that cause people to lose their faith are certain to arise. But how horrible it will be for the person who causes someone to lose his faith!"
Luke,17,2,It would be best for that person to be thrown into the sea with a large stone hung around his neck than for him to cause one of these little ones to lose his faith.
Luke,17,3,"So watch yourselves!
“If a believer sins, correct him. If he changes the way he thinks and acts, forgive him."
Luke,17,4,"Even if he wrongs you seven times in one day and comes back to you seven times and says that he is sorry, forgive him.”"
Luke,17,5,"Then the apostles said to the Lord, “Give us more faith.”"
Luke,17,6,"The Lord said, “If you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, ‘Pull yourself up by the roots, and plant yourself in the sea!’ and it would obey you."
Luke,17,7,"“Suppose someone has a servant who is plowing fields or watching sheep. Does he tell his servant when he comes from the field, ‘Have something to eat’?"
Luke,17,8,"No. Instead, he tells his servant, ‘Get dinner ready for me! After you serve me my dinner, you can eat yours.’"
Luke,17,9,He doesn’t thank the servant for following orders.
Luke,17,10,"That’s the way it is with you. When you’ve done everything you’re ordered to do, say, ‘We’re worthless servants. We’ve only done our duty.’ ”"
Luke,17,11,Jesus traveled along the border between Samaria and Galilee on his way to Jerusalem.
Luke,17,12,"As he went into a village, ten men with a skin disease met him. They stood at a distance"
Luke,17,13,"and shouted, “Jesus, Teacher, have mercy on us!”"
Luke,17,14,"When he saw them, he told them, “Show yourselves to the priests.” As they went, they were made clean."
Luke,17,15,"When one of them saw that he was healed, he turned back and praised God in a loud voice."
Luke,17,16,He quickly bowed at Jesus’ feet and thanked him. (The man was a Samaritan.)
Luke,17,17,"Jesus asked, “Weren’t ten men made clean? Where are the other nine?"
Luke,17,18,Only this foreigner came back to praise God.”
Luke,17,19,"Jesus told the man, “Get up, and go home! Your faith has made you well.”"
Luke,17,20,"The Pharisees asked Jesus when God’s kingdom would come.
He answered them, “People can’t observe the coming of God’s kingdom."
Luke,17,21,"They can’t say, ‘Here it is!’ or ‘There it is!’ You see, God’s kingdom is within  you.”"
Luke,17,22,"Jesus said to his disciples, “The time will come when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it."
Luke,17,23,"People will say, ‘There he is!’ or ‘Here he is!’ Don’t run after those people."
Luke,17,24,The day of the Son of Man  will be like lightning that flashes from one end of the sky to the other.
Luke,17,25,But first he must suffer a lot and be rejected by the people of his day.
Luke,17,26,"“When the Son of Man comes again, the situation will be like the time of Noah."
Luke,17,27,"People were eating, drinking, and getting married until the day that Noah went into the ship. Then the flood destroyed all of them."
Luke,17,28,"“The situation will also be like the time of Lot. People were eating, drinking, buying and selling, planting and building."
Luke,17,29,"But on the day that Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained from the sky and destroyed all of them."
Luke,17,30,The day when the Son of Man is revealed will be like that.
Luke,17,31,“On that day those who are on the roof shouldn’t come down to get their belongings out of their houses. Those who are in the field shouldn’t turn back.
Luke,17,32,Remember Lot’s wife!
Luke,17,33,"Those who try to save their lives will lose them, and those who lose their lives will save them."
Luke,17,34,"“I can guarantee that on that night if two people are in one bed, one will be taken and the other one will be left."
Luke,17,35,"Two women will be grinding grain together. One will be taken, and the other one will be left.”"
Luke,18,1,Jesus used this illustration with his disciples to show them that they need to pray all the time and never give up.
Luke,18,2,"He said, “In a city there was a judge who didn’t fear God or respect people."
Luke,18,3,"In that city there was also a widow who kept coming to him and saying, ‘Give me justice.’"
Luke,18,4,"“For a while the judge refused to do anything. But then he thought, ‘This widow really annoys me. Although I don’t fear God or respect people"
Luke,18,5,"I’ll have to give her justice. Otherwise, she’ll keep coming to me until she wears me out.’ ”"
Luke,18,6,"The Lord added, “Pay attention to what the dishonest judge thought."
Luke,18,7,Won’t God give his chosen people justice when they cry out to him for help day and night? Is he slow to help them?
Luke,18,8,"I can guarantee that he will give them justice quickly. But when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?”"
Luke,18,9,Jesus also used this illustration with some who were sure that God approved of them while they looked down on everyone else.
Luke,18,10,"He said, “Two men went into the temple courtyard to pray. One was a Pharisee, and the other was a tax collector."
Luke,18,11,"The Pharisee stood up and prayed, ‘God, I thank you that I’m not like other people! I’m not a robber or a dishonest person. I haven’t committed adultery. I’m not even like this tax collector."
Luke,18,12,"I fast twice a week, and I give you a tenth of my entire income.’"
Luke,18,13,"“But the tax collector was standing at a distance. He wouldn’t even look up to heaven. Instead, he became very upset, and he said, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’"
Luke,18,14,"“I can guarantee that this tax collector went home with God’s approval, but the Pharisee didn’t. Everyone who honors himself will be humbled, but the person who humbles himself will be honored.”"
Luke,18,15,"Some people brought infants to Jesus to have him hold them. When the disciples saw this, they told the people not to do that."
Luke,18,16,"But Jesus called the infants to him and said, “Don’t stop the children from coming to me! Children like these are part of God’s kingdom."
Luke,18,17,I can guarantee this truth: Whoever doesn’t receive God’s kingdom as a little child receives it will never enter it.”
Luke,18,18,"An official asked Jesus, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”"
Luke,18,19,"Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God."
Luke,18,20,You know the commandments: Never commit adultery. Never murder. Never steal. Never give false testimony. Honor your father and your mother.”
Luke,18,21,"The official replied, “I’ve obeyed all these commandments since I was a boy.”"
Luke,18,22,"When Jesus heard this, he said to him, “You still need one thing. Sell everything you have. Distribute the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then follow me!”"
Luke,18,23,"When the official heard this, he became sad, because he was very rich."
Luke,18,24,"Jesus watched him and said, “How hard it is for rich people to enter God’s kingdom!"
Luke,18,25,"Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter God’s kingdom.”"
Luke,18,26,"Those who heard him asked, “Who, then, can be saved?”"
Luke,18,27,"Jesus said, “The things that are impossible for people to do are possible for God to do.”"
Luke,18,28,"Then Peter said, “We’ve left everything to follow you.”"
Luke,18,29,"Jesus said to them, “I can guarantee this truth: Anyone who gave up his home, wife, brothers, parents, or children because of God’s kingdom"
Luke,18,30,will certainly receive many times as much in this life and will receive eternal life in the world to come.”
Luke,18,31,"Jesus took the twelve apostles aside and said to them, “We’re going to Jerusalem. Everything that the prophets wrote about the Son of Man will come true."
Luke,18,32,"He will be handed over to foreigners. They will make fun of him, insult him, spit on him"
Luke,18,33,"whip him, and kill him. But on the third day he will come back to life.”"
Luke,18,34,"But they didn’t understand any of this. What he said was a mystery to them, and they didn’t know what he meant."
Luke,18,35,"As Jesus came near Jericho, a blind man was sitting and begging by the road."
Luke,18,36,"When he heard the crowd going by, he tried to find out what was happening."
Luke,18,37,The people told him that Jesus from Nazareth was passing by.
Luke,18,38,"Then the blind man shouted, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”"
Luke,18,39,"The people at the front of the crowd told the blind man to be quiet. But he shouted even louder, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”"
Luke,18,40,"Jesus stopped and ordered them to bring the man to him. When the man came near, Jesus asked him"
Luke,18,41,"“What do you want me to do for you?”
The blind man said, “Lord, I want to see again.”"
Luke,18,42,"Jesus told him, “Receive your sight! Your faith has made you well.”"
Luke,18,43,"Immediately, he could see again. He followed Jesus and praised God. All the people saw this, and they, too, praised God."
Luke,19,1,Jesus was passing through Jericho.
Luke,19,2,"A man named Zacchaeus was there. He was the director of tax collectors, and he was rich."
Luke,19,3,"He tried to see who Jesus was. But Zacchaeus was a small man, and he couldn’t see Jesus because of the crowd."
Luke,19,4,"So Zacchaeus ran ahead and climbed a fig tree to see Jesus, who was coming that way."
Luke,19,5,"When Jesus came to the tree, he looked up and said, “Zacchaeus, come down! I must stay at your house today.”"
Luke,19,6,Zacchaeus came down and was glad to welcome Jesus into his home.
Luke,19,7,"But the people who saw this began to express disapproval. They said, “He went to be the guest of a sinner.”"
Luke,19,8,"⌞Later, at dinner,⌟ Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, “Lord, I’ll give half of my property to the poor. I’ll pay four times as much as I owe to those I have cheated in any way.”"
Luke,19,9,"Then Jesus said to Zacchaeus, “You and your family have been saved today. You’ve shown that you, too, are one of Abraham’s descendants."
Luke,19,10,"Indeed, the Son of Man has come to seek and to save people who are lost.”"
Luke,19,11,"Jesus was getting closer to Jerusalem, and the people thought that God’s kingdom would appear suddenly. While Jesus had the people’s attention, he used this illustration."
Luke,19,12,"He said, “A prince went to a distant country to be appointed king, and then he returned."
Luke,19,13,"⌞Before he left,⌟ he called ten of his servants and gave them ten coins. He said to his servants, ‘Invest this money until I come back.’"
Luke,19,14,"“The citizens of his own country hated him. They sent representatives to follow him and say ⌞to the person who was going to appoint him⌟, ‘We don’t want this man to be our king.’"
Luke,19,15,"“After he was appointed king, he came back. Then he said, ‘Call those servants to whom I gave money. I want to know how much each one has made by investing.’"
Luke,19,16,"“The first servant said, ‘Sir, the coin you gave me has earned ten times as much.’"
Luke,19,17,"“The king said to him, ‘Good job! You’re a good servant. You proved that you could be trusted with a little money. Take charge of ten cities.’"
Luke,19,18,"“The second servant said, ‘The coin you gave me, sir, has made five times as much.’"
Luke,19,19,"“The king said to this servant, ‘You take charge of five cities.’"
Luke,19,20,"“Then the other servant said, ‘Sir, look! Here’s your coin. I’ve kept it in a cloth for safekeeping because"
Luke,19,21,I was afraid of you. You’re a tough person to get along with. You take what isn’t yours and harvest grain you haven’t planted.’
Luke,19,22,"“The king said to him, ‘I’ll judge you by what you’ve said, you evil servant! You knew that I was a tough person to get along with. You knew that I take what isn’t mine and harvest grain I haven’t planted."
Luke,19,23,"Then why didn’t you put my money in the bank? When I came back, I could have collected it with interest.’"
Luke,19,24,"The king told his men, ‘Take his coin away, and give it to the man who has ten.’"
Luke,19,25,"“They replied, ‘Sir, he already has ten coins.’"
Luke,19,26,“ ‘I can guarantee that everyone who has something will be given more. But everything will be taken away from those who don’t have much.
Luke,19,27,"Bring my enemies, who didn’t want me to be their king. Kill them in front of me.’ ”"
Luke,19,28,"After Jesus had given this illustration, he continued on his way to Jerusalem."
Luke,19,29,"When he came near Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives (as it was called), Jesus sent two of his disciples ahead of him."
Luke,19,30,"He said to them, “Go into the village ahead of you. As you enter, you will find a young donkey tied there. No one has ever sat on it. Untie it, and bring it."
Luke,19,31,"If anyone asks you why you are untying it, say that the Lord needs it.”"
Luke,19,32,The men Jesus sent found it as he had told them.
Luke,19,33,"While they were untying the young donkey, its owners asked them, “Why are you untying the donkey?”"
Luke,19,34,"The disciples answered, “The Lord needs it.”"
Luke,19,35,"They brought the donkey to Jesus, put their coats on it, and helped Jesus onto it."
Luke,19,36,"As he was riding along, people spread their coats on the road."
Luke,19,37,By this time he was coming near the place where the road went down the Mount of Olives. Then the whole crowd of disciples began to praise God for all the miracles they had seen.
Luke,19,38,"They shouted joyfully,
“Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord!
Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest heaven.”"
Luke,19,39,"Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus, “Teacher, tell your disciples to be quiet.”"
Luke,19,40,"Jesus replied, “I can guarantee that if they are quiet, the stones will cry out.”"
Luke,19,41,"When he came closer and saw the city, he began to cry."
Luke,19,42,"He said, “If you had only known today what would bring you peace! But now it is hidden, so you cannot see it."
Luke,19,43,The time will come when enemy armies will build a wall to surround you and close you in on every side.
Luke,19,44,"They will level you to the ground and kill your people. One stone will not be left on top of another, because you didn’t recognize the time when God came to help you.”"
Luke,19,45,Jesus went into the temple courtyard and began to throw out those who were selling things there.
Luke,19,46,"He said to them, “Scripture says, ‘My house will be a house of prayer,’ but you have turned it into a gathering place for thieves.”"
Luke,19,47,"Jesus taught in the temple courtyard every day. The chief priests, the experts in Moses’ Teachings, and the leaders of the people looked for a way to kill him."
Luke,19,48,"But they could not find a way to do it, because all the people were eager to hear him."
Luke,20,1,"One day Jesus was teaching the people in the temple courtyard and telling them the Good News. The chief priests, the experts in Moses’ Teachings, and the leaders came up to him."
Luke,20,2,"They asked him, “Tell us, what gives you the right to do these things? Who told you that you could do this?”"
Luke,20,3,"Jesus answered them, “I, too, have a question for you. Tell me"
Luke,20,4,did John’s right to baptize come from heaven or from humans?”
Luke,20,5,"They talked about this among themselves. They said, “If we say, ‘from heaven,’ he will ask, ‘Why didn’t you believe him?’"
Luke,20,6,"But if we say, ‘from humans,’ everyone will stone us to death. They’re convinced that John was a prophet.”"
Luke,20,7,So they answered that they didn’t know who gave John the right to baptize.
Luke,20,8,"Jesus told them, “Then I won’t tell you why I have the right to do these things.”"
Luke,20,9,"Then, using this illustration, Jesus spoke to the people: “A man planted a vineyard, leased it to vineyard workers, and went on a long trip."
Luke,20,10,“At the right time he sent a servant to the workers to obtain from them a share of the grapes from the vineyard. But the workers beat the servant and sent him back with nothing.
Luke,20,11,"So he sent a different servant. The workers beat him, treated him shamefully, and sent him back with nothing."
Luke,20,12,Then he sent a third servant. But they injured this one and threw him out ⌞of the vineyard⌟.
Luke,20,13,"“Then the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What should I do? I’ll send my son, whom I love. They’ll probably respect him.’"
Luke,20,14,"“When the workers saw him, they talked it over among themselves. They said, ‘This is the heir. Let’s kill him so that the inheritance will be ours.’"
Luke,20,15,"So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.
“What will the owner of the vineyard do to them?"
Luke,20,16,"He will destroy these workers and give the vineyard to others.”
Those who heard him said, “That’s unthinkable!”"
Luke,20,17,"Then Jesus looked straight at them and asked, “What, then, does this Scripture verse mean:
‘The stone that the builders rejected
has become the cornerstone’?"
Luke,20,18,"Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken. If that stone falls on anyone, it will crush that person.”"
Luke,20,19,"The experts in Moses’ Teachings and the chief priests wanted to arrest him right there, but they were afraid of the people. They knew that he had directed this illustration at them."
Luke,20,20,So they watched for an opportunity to send out some spies. The spies were to act like sincere religious people. They wanted to catch him saying the wrong thing so that they could hand him over to the governor.
Luke,20,21,"They asked him, “Teacher, we know that you’re right in what you say and teach. Besides, you don’t play favorites. Rather, you teach the way of God truthfully."
Luke,20,22,Is it right for us to pay taxes to the emperor or not?”
Luke,20,23,"He saw through their scheme, so he said to them"
Luke,20,24,"“Show me a coin. Whose face and name is this?”
They answered, “The emperor’s.”"
Luke,20,25,"He said to them, “Well, then give the emperor what belongs to the emperor, and give God what belongs to God.”"
Luke,20,26,"They couldn’t make him say anything wrong in front of the people. His answer surprised them, so they said no more."
Luke,20,27,"Some Sadducees, who say that people will never come back to life, came to Jesus. They asked him"
Luke,20,28,"“Teacher, Moses wrote for us, ‘If a married man dies and has no children, his brother should marry his widow and have children for his brother.’"
Luke,20,29,There were seven brothers. The first got married and died without having children.
Luke,20,30,Then the second brother married the widow
Luke,20,31,"and so did the third. In the same way all seven brothers married the widow, died, and left no children."
Luke,20,32,"Finally, the woman died."
Luke,20,33,"Now, when the dead come back to life, whose wife will she be? The seven brothers had married her.”"
Luke,20,34,"Jesus said to them, “In this world people get married."
Luke,20,35,But people who are considered worthy to come back to life and live in the next world will neither marry
Luke,20,36,nor die anymore. They are the same as the angels. They are God’s children who have come back to life.
Luke,20,37,"“Even Moses showed in the passage about the bush that the dead come back to life. He says that the Lord is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."
Luke,20,38,He’s not the God of the dead but of the living. In God’s sight all people are living.”
Luke,20,39,"Some experts in Moses’ Teachings responded, “Teacher, that was well said.”"
Luke,20,40,"From that time on, no one dared to ask him another question."
Luke,20,41,"Jesus said to them, “How can people say that the Messiah is David’s son?"
Luke,20,42,"David says in the book of Psalms,
‘The Lord said to my Lord,
“Take the honored position—the one next to me [God the Father] on the heavenly throne"
Luke,20,43,until I put your enemies under your control.” ’
Luke,20,44,David calls him Lord. So how can he be his son?”
Luke,20,45,"While all the people were listening, Jesus said to the disciples"
Luke,20,46,"“Beware of the experts in Moses’ Teachings! They like to walk around in long robes and love to be greeted in the marketplaces, to have the front seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at dinners."
Luke,20,47,They rob widows by taking their houses and then say long prayers to make themselves look good. The experts in Moses’ Teachings will receive the most severe punishment.”
Luke,21,1,"Looking up, Jesus saw people, especially the rich, dropping their gifts into the temple offering box."
Luke,21,2,He noticed a poor widow drop in two small coins.
Luke,21,3,"He said, “I can guarantee this truth: This poor widow has given more than all the others."
Luke,21,4,"All of these people have given what they could spare. But she, in her poverty, has given everything she had to live on.”"
Luke,21,5,Some ⌞of the disciples⌟ were talking about the temple complex. They noted that it was built with fine stones and decorated with beautiful gifts. So Jesus said
Luke,21,6,“About these buildings that you see—the time will come when not one of these stones will be left on top of another. Each one will be torn down.”
Luke,21,7,"The disciples asked him, “Teacher, when will this happen? What will be the sign when all this will occur?”"
Luke,21,8,"Jesus said, “Be careful that you are not deceived. Many will come using my name. They will say, ‘I am he!’ and ‘The time is near.’ Don’t follow them!"
Luke,21,9,"“When you hear of wars and revolutions, don’t be terrified! These things must happen first, but the end will not come immediately.”"
Luke,21,10,"Then Jesus continued, “Nation will fight against nation and kingdom against kingdom."
Luke,21,11,"There will be terrible earthquakes, famines, and dreadful diseases in various places. Terrifying sights and miraculous signs will come from the sky."
Luke,21,12,"“Before all these things happen, people will arrest and persecute you. They will hand you over to their synagogues and put you into their prisons. They will drag you in front of kings and governors because of my name."
Luke,21,13,It will be your opportunity to testify to them.
Luke,21,14,So make up your minds not to worry beforehand how you will defend yourselves.
Luke,21,15,I will give you words and wisdom that none of your enemies will be able to oppose or prove wrong.
Luke,21,16,"“Even parents, brothers, relatives, and friends will betray you and kill some of you."
Luke,21,17,Everyone will hate you because you are committed to me.
Luke,21,18,But not a hair on your head will be lost.
Luke,21,19,By your endurance you will save your life.
Luke,21,20,"“When you see armies camped around Jerusalem, realize that the time is near for it to be destroyed."
Luke,21,21,Then those of you in Judea should flee to the mountains. Those of you in Jerusalem should leave it. Those of you in the fields shouldn’t go back into them.
Luke,21,22,This will be a time of vengeance. Everything that is written about it will come true.
Luke,21,23,"“How horrible it will be for women who are pregnant or who are nursing babies in those days. Indeed, the land will suffer very hard times, and its people will be punished."
Luke,21,24,"Swords will cut them down, and they will be carried off into all nations as prisoners. Nations will trample Jerusalem until the times allowed for the nations ⌞to do this⌟ are over."
Luke,21,25,"“Miraculous signs will occur in the sun, moon, and stars. The nations of the earth will be deeply troubled and confused because of the roaring and tossing of the sea."
Luke,21,26,"People will faint as they fearfully wait for what will happen to the world. Indeed, the powers of the universe will be shaken."
Luke,21,27,“Then people will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
Luke,21,28,"“When these things begin to happen, stand with confidence! The time when you will be set free is near.”"
Luke,21,29,Then Jesus used this story as an illustration. “Look at the fig tree or any other tree.
Luke,21,30,"As soon as leaves grow on them, you know without being told that summer is near."
Luke,21,31,"In the same way, when you see these things happen, you know that God’s kingdom is near."
Luke,21,32,“I can guarantee this truth: This generation will not disappear until all this takes place.
Luke,21,33,"The earth and the heavens will disappear, but my words will never disappear."
Luke,21,34,"“Make sure that you don’t become drunk, hung over, and worried about life. Then that day could suddenly catch you by surprise"
Luke,21,35,like a trap that catches a bird. That day will surprise all people who live on the earth.
Luke,21,36,Be alert at all times. Pray so that you have the power to escape everything that is about to happen and to stand in front of the Son of Man.”
Luke,21,37,During the day Jesus would teach in the temple courtyard. But at night he would go to the Mount of Olives (as it was called) and spend the night there.
Luke,21,38,All of the people would get up early to hear him speak in the temple courtyard.
Luke,22,1,"The Festival of Unleavened Bread, called Passover, was near."
Luke,22,2,"The chief priests and the experts in Moses’ Teachings were looking for some way to kill Jesus. However, they were afraid of the people."
Luke,22,3,"Then Satan entered Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve apostles."
Luke,22,4,Judas went to the chief priests and the temple guards and discussed with them how he could betray Jesus.
Luke,22,5,They were pleased and agreed to give him some money.
Luke,22,6,So Judas promised to do it. He kept looking for an opportunity to betray Jesus to them when there was no crowd.
Luke,22,7,The day came during the Festival of Unleavened Bread when the Passover lamb had to be killed.
Luke,22,8,"Jesus sent Peter and John and told them, “Go, prepare the Passover lamb for us to eat.”"
Luke,22,9,"They asked him, “Where do you want us to prepare it?”"
Luke,22,10,"He told them, “Go into the city, and you will meet a man carrying a jug of water. Follow him into the house he enters."
Luke,22,11,"Tell the owner of the house that the teacher asks, ‘Where is the room where I can eat the Passover meal with my disciples?’"
Luke,22,12,He will take you upstairs and show you a large furnished room. Get things ready there.”
Luke,22,13,The disciples left. They found everything as Jesus had told them and prepared the Passover.
Luke,22,14,"When it was time to eat the Passover meal, Jesus and the apostles were at the table."
Luke,22,15,"Jesus said to them, “I’ve had a deep desire to eat this Passover with you before I suffer."
Luke,22,16,I can guarantee that I won’t eat it again until it finds its fulfillment in God’s kingdom.”
Luke,22,17,"Then he took a cup and spoke a prayer of thanksgiving. He said, “Take this, and share it."
Luke,22,18,I can guarantee that from now on I won’t drink this wine until God’s kingdom comes.”
Luke,22,19,"Then Jesus took bread and spoke a prayer of thanksgiving. He broke the bread, gave it to them, and said, “This is my body, which is given up for you. Do this to remember me.”"
Luke,22,20,"When supper was over, he did the same with the cup. He said, “This cup that is poured out for you is the new promise  made with my blood.”"
Luke,22,21,“The hand of the one who will betray me is with me on the table.
Luke,22,22,The Son of Man is going to die the way it has been planned for him. But how horrible it will be for that person who betrays him.”
Luke,22,23,So they began to discuss with each other who could do such a thing.
Luke,22,24,Then a quarrel broke out among the disciples. They argued about who should be considered the greatest.
Luke,22,25,"Jesus said to them, “The kings of nations have power over their people, and those in authority call themselves friends of the people."
Luke,22,26,"But you’re not going to be that way! Rather, the greatest among you must be like the youngest, and your leader must be like a servant."
Luke,22,27,"Who’s the greatest, the person who sits at the table or the servant? Isn’t it really the person who sits at the table? But I’m among you as a servant."
Luke,22,28,“You have stood by me in the troubles that have tested me.
Luke,22,29,"So as my Father has given me a kingdom, I’m giving it to you."
Luke,22,30,You will eat and drink at my table in my kingdom. You will also sit on thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Israel.”
Luke,22,31,"⌞Then the Lord said,⌟ “Simon, Simon, listen! Satan has demanded to have you apostles for himself. He wants to separate you from me as a farmer separates wheat from husks."
Luke,22,32,"But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith will not fail. So when you recover, strengthen the other disciples.”"
Luke,22,33,"But Peter said to him, “Lord, I’m ready to go to prison with you and to die with you.”"
Luke,22,34,"Jesus replied, “Peter, I can guarantee that the rooster won’t crow tonight until you say three times that you don’t know me.”"
Luke,22,35,"Then Jesus said to them, “When I sent you out without a wallet, traveling bag, or sandals, you didn’t lack anything, did you?”
“Not a thing!” they answered."
Luke,22,36,"Then he said to them, “But now, the person who has a wallet and a traveling bag should take them along. The person who doesn’t have a sword should sell his coat and buy one."
Luke,22,37,"I can guarantee that the Scripture passage which says, ‘He was counted with criminals,’ must find its fulfillment in me. Indeed, whatever is written about me will come true.”"
Luke,22,38,"The disciples said, “Lord, look! Here are two swords!”
Then Jesus said to them, “That’s enough!”"
Luke,22,39,Jesus went out ⌞of the city⌟ to the Mount of Olives as he usually did. His disciples followed him.
Luke,22,40,"When he arrived, he said to them, “Pray that you won’t be tempted.”"
Luke,22,41,"Then he withdrew from them about a stone’s throw, knelt down, and prayed"
Luke,22,42,"“Father, if it is your will, take this cup ⌞of suffering⌟ away from me. However, your will must be done, not mine.”"
Luke,22,43,Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and gave him strength.
Luke,22,44,So he prayed very hard in anguish. His sweat became like drops of blood falling to the ground.
Luke,22,45,"When Jesus ended his prayer, he got up and went to the disciples. He found them asleep and overcome with sadness."
Luke,22,46,"He said to them, “Why are you sleeping? Get up, and pray that you won’t be tempted.”"
Luke,22,47,"While he was still speaking to the disciples, a crowd arrived. The man called Judas, one of the twelve apostles, was leading them. He came close to Jesus to kiss him."
Luke,22,48,"Jesus said to him, “Judas, do you intend to betray the Son of Man with a kiss?”"
Luke,22,49,"The men who were with Jesus saw what was going to happen. So they asked him, “Lord, should we use our swords to fight?”"
Luke,22,50,One of the disciples cut off the right ear of the chief priest’s servant.
Luke,22,51,"But Jesus said, “Stop! That’s enough of this.” Then he touched the servant’s ear and healed him."
Luke,22,52,"Then Jesus said to the chief priests, temple guards, and leaders who had come for him, “Have you come out with swords and clubs as if I were a criminal?"
Luke,22,53,"I was with you in the temple courtyard every day and you didn’t try to arrest me. But this is your time, when darkness rules.”"
Luke,22,54,"So they arrested Jesus and led him away to the chief priest’s house.
Peter followed at a distance."
Luke,22,55,"Some men had lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard. As they sat together, Peter sat among them."
Luke,22,56,"A female servant saw him as he sat facing the glow of the fire. She stared at him and said, “This man was with Jesus.”"
Luke,22,57,"But Peter denied it by saying, “I don’t know him, woman.”"
Luke,22,58,"A little later someone else saw Peter and said, “You are one of them.”
But Peter said, “Not me!”"
Luke,22,59,"About an hour later another person insisted, “It’s obvious that this man was with him. He’s a Galilean!”"
Luke,22,60,"But Peter said, “I don’t know what you’re talking about!”
Just then, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed."
Luke,22,61,"Then the Lord turned and looked directly at Peter. Peter remembered what the Lord had said: “Before a rooster crows today, you will say three times that you don’t know me.”"
Luke,22,62,Then Peter went outside and cried bitterly.
Luke,22,63,The men who were guarding Jesus made fun of him as they beat him.
Luke,22,64,"They blindfolded him and said to him, “Tell us who hit you.”"
Luke,22,65,They also insulted him in many other ways.
Luke,22,66,"In the morning the council of the people’s leaders, the chief priests and the experts in Moses’ Teachings, gathered together. They brought Jesus in front of their highest court and asked him"
Luke,22,67,"“Tell us, are you the Messiah?”
Jesus said to them, “If I tell you, you won’t believe me."
Luke,22,68,"And if I ask you, you won’t answer."
Luke,22,69,"But from now on, the Son of Man will be in the honored position—the one next to God the Father on the heavenly throne.”"
Luke,22,70,"Then all of them said, “So you’re the Son of God?”
Jesus answered them, “You’re right to say that I am.”"
Luke,22,71,"Then they said, “Why do we need any more testimony? We’ve heard him say it ourselves.”"
Luke,23,1,Then the entire assembly stood up and took him to Pilate.
Luke,23,2,"They began to accuse Jesus by saying, “We found that he stirs up trouble among our people: He keeps them from paying taxes to the emperor, and he says that he is Christ, a king.”"
Luke,23,3,"Pilate asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”
“Yes, I am,” Jesus answered."
Luke,23,4,"Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowd, “I can’t find this man guilty of any crime.”"
Luke,23,5,"The priests and the crowd became more forceful. They said, “He stirs up the people throughout Judea with his teachings. He started in Galilee and has come here.”"
Luke,23,6,"When Pilate heard that, he asked if the man was from Galilee."
Luke,23,7,"When Pilate found out that he was, he sent Jesus to Herod. Herod ruled Galilee and was in Jerusalem at that time."
Luke,23,8,Herod was very pleased to see Jesus. For a long time he had wanted to see him. He had heard about Jesus and hoped to see him perform some kind of miracle.
Luke,23,9,"Herod asked Jesus many questions, but Jesus wouldn’t answer him."
Luke,23,10,"Meanwhile, the chief priests and the experts in Moses’ Teachings stood there and shouted their accusations against Jesus."
Luke,23,11,Herod and his soldiers treated Jesus with contempt and made fun of him. They put a colorful robe on him and sent him back to Pilate.
Luke,23,12,So Herod and Pilate became friends that day. They had been enemies before this.
Luke,23,13,"Then Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people."
Luke,23,14,"He told them, “You brought me this man as someone who turns the people against the government. I’ve questioned him in front of you and haven’t found this man guilty of the crimes of which you accuse him."
Luke,23,15,Neither could Herod. So he sent this man back to us. This man hasn’t done anything to deserve the death penalty.
Luke,23,16,So I’m going to have him whipped and set free.”
Luke,24,1,Very early on Sunday morning the women went to the tomb. They were carrying the spices that they had prepared.
Luke,24,2,They found that the stone had been rolled away from the tomb.
Luke,24,3,"When they went in, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus."
Luke,24,4,"While they were puzzled about this, two men in clothes that were as bright as lightning suddenly stood beside them."
Luke,24,5,"The women were terrified and bowed to the ground.
The men asked the women, “Why are you looking among the dead for the living one?"
Luke,24,6,He’s not here. He has been brought back to life! Remember what he told you while he was still in Galilee.
Luke,24,7,"He said, ‘The Son of Man must be handed over to sinful people, be crucified, and come back to life on the third day.’ ”"
Luke,24,8,Then the women remembered what Jesus had told them.
Luke,24,9,The women left the tomb and went back to the city. They told everything to the eleven apostles and all the others.
Luke,24,10,"The women were Mary from Magdala, Joanna, and Mary (the mother of James). There were also other women with them. They told the apostles everything."
Luke,24,11,"The apostles thought that the women’s story didn’t make any sense, and they didn’t believe them."
Luke,24,12,"But Peter got up and ran to the tomb. He bent down to look inside and saw only the strips of linen. Then he went away, wondering what had happened."
Luke,24,13,"On the same day, two of Jesus’ disciples were going to a village called Emmaus. It was about seven miles from Jerusalem."
Luke,24,14,They were talking to each other about everything that had happened.
Luke,24,15,"While they were talking, Jesus approached them and began walking with them."
Luke,24,16,"Although they saw him, they didn’t recognize him."
Luke,24,17,"He asked them, “What are you discussing?”
They stopped and looked very sad."
Luke,24,18,"One of them, Cleopas, replied, “Are you the only one in Jerusalem who doesn’t know what has happened recently?”"
Luke,24,19,"“What happened?” he asked.
They said to him, “We were discussing what happened to Jesus from Nazareth. He was a powerful prophet in what he did and said in the sight of God and all the people."
Luke,24,20,Our chief priests and rulers had him condemned to death and crucified.
Luke,24,21,"We were hoping that he was the one who would free Israel. What’s more, this is now the third day since everything happened."
Luke,24,22,Some of the women from our group startled us. They went to the tomb early this morning
Luke,24,23,and didn’t find his body. They told us that they had seen angels who said that he’s alive.
Luke,24,24,"Some of our men went to the tomb and found it empty, as the women had said, but they didn’t see him.”"
Luke,24,25,"Then Jesus said to them, “How foolish you are! You’re so slow to believe everything the prophets said!"
Luke,24,26,Didn’t the Messiah have to suffer these things and enter into his glory?”
Luke,24,27,Then he began with Moses’ Teachings and the Prophets to explain to them what was said about him throughout the Scriptures.
Luke,24,28,"When they came near the village where they were going, Jesus acted as if he were going farther."
Luke,24,29,"They urged him, “Stay with us! It’s getting late, and the day is almost over.” So he went to stay with them."
Luke,24,30,"While he was at the table with them, he took bread and blessed it. He broke the bread and gave it to them."
Luke,24,31,"Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. But he vanished from their sight."
Luke,24,32,"They said to each other, “Weren’t we excited when he talked with us on the road and opened up the meaning of the Scriptures for us?”"
Luke,24,33,That same hour they went back to Jerusalem. They found the eleven apostles and those who were with them gathered together.
Luke,24,34,"They were saying, “The Lord has really come back to life and has appeared to Simon.”"
Luke,24,35,Then the two disciples told what had happened on the road and how they had recognized Jesus when he broke the bread.
Luke,24,36,"While they were talking about what had happened, Jesus stood among them. He said to them, “Peace be with you!”"
Luke,24,37,"They were terrified, and thought they were seeing a ghost."
Luke,24,38,"He asked them, “Why are you afraid? Why do you have doubts?"
Luke,24,39,"Look at my hands and feet, and see that it’s really me. Touch me, and see for yourselves. Ghosts don’t have flesh and bones, but you can see that I do.”"
Luke,24,40,"As he said this, he showed them his hands and feet."
Luke,24,41,"The disciples were overcome with joy and amazement because this seemed too good to be true. Then Jesus asked them, “Do you have anything to eat?”"
Luke,24,42,They gave him a piece of broiled fish.
Luke,24,43,He took it and ate it while they watched him.
Luke,24,44,"Then he said to them, “These are the words I spoke to you while I was still with you. I told you that everything written about me in Moses’ Teachings, the Prophets, and the Psalms had to come true.”"
Luke,24,45,Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures.
Luke,24,46,"He said to them, “Scripture says that the Messiah would suffer and that he would come back to life on the third day."
Luke,24,47,"Scripture also says that by the authority of Jesus people would be told to turn to God and change the way they think and act so that their sins will be forgiven. This would be told to people from all nations, beginning in the city of Jerusalem."
Luke,24,48,You are witnesses to these things.
Luke,24,49,“I’m sending you what my Father promised. Wait here in the city until you receive power from heaven.”
Luke,24,50,Then Jesus took them to a place near Bethany. There he raised his hands and blessed them.
Luke,24,51,"While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken to heaven."
Luke,24,52,The disciples worshiped him and were overjoyed as they went back to Jerusalem.
Luke,24,53,"They were always in the temple, where they praised God."
