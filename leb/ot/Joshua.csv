Joshua,1,1,"After the death of Moses the servant of Yahweh, Yahweh said to Joshua son of Nun, the assistant of Moses, saying,"
Joshua,1,2,"“My servant Moses is dead. Get up and cross the Jordan, you and all this people, into the land that I am giving to them, to the Israelites."
Joshua,1,3,"Every place that the soles of your feet will tread, I have given it to you, as I promised to Moses."
Joshua,1,4,"From the wilderness and the Lebanon, up to the great river, the river Euphrates, all of the land of the Hittites, and up to the great sea in the west, will be your territory."
Joshua,1,5,"No one will stand before you all the days of your life. Just as I was with Moses, so will I be with you; I will not fail you, and I will not forsake you."
Joshua,1,6,"Be strong and courageous, for you will give the people this land as an inheritance that I swore to their ancestors to give them."
Joshua,1,7,"Only be strong and very courageous to observe diligently the whole law that Moses my servant commanded you. Do not turn aside from it, to the right or left, so that you may succeed wherever you go."
Joshua,1,8,The scroll of this law will not depart from your mouth; you will meditate on it day and night so that you may observe diligently all that is written in it. For then you will succeed in your ways and prosper.
Joshua,1,9,"Did I not command you? Be strong and courageous! Do not fear or be dismayed, for Yahweh your God is with you wherever you go.”"
Joshua,1,10,"Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,"
Joshua,1,11,“Pass through the midst of the camp and command the people: ‘Prepare your provisions; in three days you are to cross the Jordan to go possess the land that Yahweh your God is giving you to possess.’ ”
Joshua,1,12,"To the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh Joshua said,"
Joshua,1,13,"“Remember the word that Moses Yahweh’s servant commanded you, saying, ‘Yahweh your God is giving rest to you, and he is giving you this land.’"
Joshua,1,14,"Your wives, your little children, and your livestock, they will remain in the land that Moses gave to you beyond the Jordan. All of the best fighting men will cross armed in front of your families; they will help you"
Joshua,1,15,"until Yahweh gives rest to your families as well as to you. They will take possession of the land that Yahweh your God is giving to them. Then you will return to your own land and take possession of it, the land that Moses the servant of Yahweh gave you beyond the Jordan to the east.”"
Joshua,1,16,"And they answered Joshua, saying, “All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you will send us we will go."
Joshua,1,17,"Just as we obeyed Moses, so will we obey you. Only may Yahweh your God be with you, as he was with Moses."
Joshua,1,18,Whoever rebels against your orders and does not obey your words according to what you commanded us will be put to death. Only be strong and courageous.”
Joshua,2,1,"Then Joshua son of Nun secretly sent two men from Acacia Grove as spies, saying, “Go, view the land, especially Jericho.” So they went, and entered the house of a prostitute whose name was Rahab, and spent the night there."
Joshua,2,2,"The king of Jericho was told, “Look, some men from the Israelites have come here tonight to search out the land.”"
Joshua,2,3,"And the king of Jericho sent for Rahab, saying, “Bring out the men who came to you, the ones who have entered your house, for they have come to search out the whole land.”"
Joshua,2,4,"But the woman took the two men and hid them. And she said, “Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they were from."
Joshua,2,5,"And when it was time to shut the gate for the night, the men left, and I do not know where they went. Chase after them quickly, for you may catch up to them.”"
Joshua,2,6,(But she had taken them to the roof and had hidden them in the stalks of flax that she had spread out on the roof.)
Joshua,2,7,So the men chased after them on the way to the Jordan at the fords; and they shut the gate behind the pursuers that had gone out after them.
Joshua,2,8,"Before they went to sleep, she came up to them on the roof"
Joshua,2,9,"and said to the men, “I know that Yahweh has given you the land, and that dread of you has fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away in fear because of your presence."
Joshua,2,10,"For we have heard how Yahweh dried up the waters of the Red Sea before you when you went out from Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites that were beyond the Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed."
Joshua,2,11,"We heard this, and our hearts melted, and no courage was left in anyone because of your presence. For Yahweh your God is God in the heavens above and on the earth below."
Joshua,2,12,"So then please swear to me by Yahweh, because I have shown loyalty to you, and you will also show loyalty to my family. You must give me a sign of good faith,"
Joshua,2,13,"and you will spare my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all that belongs to them; you will deliver our lives from death.”"
Joshua,2,14,"And the men said to her, “Our lives for yours. If you do not report this business of ours, we will show you loyalty and faithfulness when Yahweh gives us the land.”"
Joshua,2,15,"Then she lowered them with a rope through the window, as her house was on the outer side of the wall, and she was residing in the wall."
Joshua,2,16,"And she said to them, “Go to the mountain, so that the pursuers will not find you, and hide yourselves there three days until the pursuers return, and afterward you may go on your way.”"
Joshua,2,17,"The men said to her, “We will be released from this oath of yours that you made us swear."
Joshua,2,18,"When we come to the land, you must tie this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down, and you must gather your father and mother, and your brothers, and your whole family to your house."
Joshua,2,19,"If anyone goes outside the doors of your house, they will be responsible for their own death, and we will be innocent. Anyone who will be with you in the house, we will be responsible for their death if a hand is laid on them."
Joshua,2,20,"But if you report this business of ours, we will be released from your oath that you made us swear.”"
Joshua,2,21,"And she said, “According to your word it will be.” Then she sent them away, and they went, and she tied the scarlet cord in the window."
Joshua,2,22,"They departed and came to the mountain, and they stayed there three days until the pursuers returned. The pursuers searched all along the way but did not find them."
Joshua,2,23,"The two men returned and went down from the mountain, and they crossed over and came to Joshua son of Nun, and they told him everything that happened to them."
Joshua,2,24,"They said to Joshua, “Surely Yahweh has given all the land into our hand; also, all the inhabitants of the land melt away in fear because of our presence.”"
Joshua,3,1,"Joshua rose early in the morning, and they set out from Acacia Grove. And they came up to the Jordan, he and all the Israelites, and they spent the night there before they crossed over."
Joshua,3,2,"At the end of the three days the officers passed through the midst of the camp,"
Joshua,3,3,and they commanded the people: “When you see the Levitical priests carrying the ark of the covenant of Yahweh your God you must set out from your place and go after it.
Joshua,3,4,"But there will be a distance between you and it of about two thousand cubits in measurement. Do not come near it, so that you may know the way that you must go, for you have not passed on this way before.”"
Joshua,3,5,"And Joshua said to the people, “Sanctify yourselves, because tomorrow Yahweh will do wonders in your midst.”"
Joshua,3,6,"And Joshua said to the priests, “Take up the ark of the covenant and cross over ahead of the people.” And they took up the ark of the covenant and went ahead of the people."
Joshua,3,7,"Then Yahweh said to Joshua, “This day I will begin exalting you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that I was with Moses, and I will be with you."
Joshua,3,8,"You will command the priests carrying the ark of the covenant, saying, ‘At the moment that you come to the edge of the waters of the Jordan, you will stand still in the Jordan.’ ”"
Joshua,3,9,"And Joshua said to the Israelites, “Come here, and hear the words of Yahweh your God.”"
Joshua,3,10,"Joshua said, “By this you will know that the living God is in your midst, and he will certainly drive out the Canaanites from before you, and the Hittites, Hivites, the Perizzites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, and the Jebusites."
Joshua,3,11,Look! The ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is about to cross over ahead of you into the Jordan.
Joshua,3,12,"So then, take twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one from each tribe."
Joshua,3,13,"When the soles of the feet of the priests carrying the ark of Yahweh, Lord of all the earth, rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan will be cut off upstream, and they will stand still in one heap."
Joshua,3,14,"And it happened, when the people set out from their tents to cross over the Jordan, the priests carrying the ark of the covenant were ahead of the people."
Joshua,3,15,"When those carrying the ark came up to the Jordan, and the priests carrying the ark dipped their feet in the edge of the water (the Jordan was flowing over its banks during all the days of harvest),"
Joshua,3,16,"the waters flowing down from above stood still; they stood up in one heap very far from Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan, while the waters flowing down to the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, were completely cut off; and the people crossed over opposite Jericho."
Joshua,3,17,"And the priests carrying the ark of the covenant of Yahweh stood firmly on the dry land in the middle of the Jordan while all Israel crossed on dry ground, until all the nation finished crossing the Jordan."
Joshua,4,1,"After all the nation finished crossing the Jordan, Yahweh said to Joshua,"
Joshua,4,2,"“Take twelve men from the people, one man from each tribe,"
Joshua,4,3,"and command them, saying, ‘Take for yourselves twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan where the priests’ feet stood firmly, and bring them over with you, and set them up in the place where you will camp tonight.’ ”"
Joshua,4,4,"So Joshua summoned the twelve men whom he had appointed from the Israelites, one from each tribe."
Joshua,4,5,"And Joshua said to them, “Cross over before the ark of Yahweh your God to the middle of the Jordan, and each one of you lift up a stone on your shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites,"
Joshua,4,6,"so that this may be a reminder among you. When your children ask in the future, saying, ‘What do these stones mean to you?’"
Joshua,4,7,"you will say to them that the waters of the Jordan were cut off from before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh. When it crossed the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. These stones will be as a memorial for the Israelites for eternity.”"
Joshua,4,8,"Thus the Israelites did as Joshua commanded. They took twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan as Yahweh told Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites, and they carried them over with them to the camp, and they put them there."
Joshua,4,9,"Then Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests carrying the ark of the covenant stood, and they are there to this day."
Joshua,4,10,"The priests carrying the ark remained standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything that Yahweh commanded Joshua to tell the people was finished, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua. And the people hastily crossed over."
Joshua,4,11,"And it happened, when all the people had finished crossing, the ark of Yahweh and the priests crossed over in front of the people."
Joshua,4,12,"The children of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over armed before the Israelites, as Moses told them."
Joshua,4,13,About forty thousand armed for fighting crossed over before the presence of Yahweh to the plains of Jericho for battle.
Joshua,4,14,"On that day Yahweh exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel, and they respected him as they respected Moses all the days of his life."
Joshua,4,15,"Then Yahweh said to Joshua, saying,"
Joshua,4,16,“Command the priests carrying the ark of the testimony to come up from the Jordan.”
Joshua,4,17,"So Joshua commanded the priests, saying, “Come up from the Jordan.”"
Joshua,4,18,"And it happened that when the priests carrying the ark came up from the middle of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests’ feet touched dry land, the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and flowed over all its banks as before."
Joshua,4,19,"And the people came up from the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and they camped in Gilgal on the eastern edge of Jericho."
Joshua,4,20,"And those twelve stones that they took from the Jordan, Joshua set up in Gilgal."
Joshua,4,21,"And he said to the Israelites, “When your children ask in the future their parents, ‘What is the meaning of these stones?’"
Joshua,4,22,"you will let your children know by saying, ‘Israel crossed this Jordan on dry ground.’"
Joshua,4,23,"For Yahweh your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you, until you had crossed, just as Yahweh your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up before us until we had crossed over,"
Joshua,4,24,"so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of Yahweh is strong, so that you may fear Yahweh your God forever.”"
Joshua,5,1,"And it happened, when all the kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan to the west, and all the kings of the Canaanites who were by the sea heard that Yahweh dried up the waters of the Jordan in front of the Israelites until they crossed over, their hearts melted, and there was no courage left in them because of the presence of the Israelites."
Joshua,5,2,"At that time Yahweh said to Joshua, “Make for yourself knives of flint, and circumcise the Israelites a second time.”"
Joshua,5,3,"So Joshua made knives of flint, and he circumcised the Israelites at the hill of the foreskins."
Joshua,5,4,"This is the reason why Joshua circumcised all the people: all the males who went out from Egypt, all the warriors, died in the wilderness as they went out from Egypt on the journey."
Joshua,5,5,"For all the people who left were circumcised, but all the people born in the wilderness on the journey after they left from Egypt were not circumcised."
Joshua,5,6,"For forty years the Israelites traveled in the wilderness until all the nation, the warriors that left Egypt, perished, because they did not listen to the voice of Yahweh. To them Yahweh swore that they would not see the land that he swore to their ancestors to give to us, a land flowing with milk and honey."
Joshua,5,7,"And it was their children whom he raised in their place that Joshua circumcised, for they were uncircumcised, because they had not been circumcised on the journey."
Joshua,5,8,"And it happened, when all the nation had finished circumcising, they remained where they were in the camp until they recovered."
Joshua,5,9,"And Yahweh said to Joshua, “Today I have rolled away the disgrace of Egypt from you.” Therefore, the name of that place is called Gilgal to this day."
Joshua,5,10,"And the Israelites camped at Gilgal, and they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, on the plains of Jericho."
Joshua,5,11,"On the next day after the Passover, on that very day, they ate from the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and roasted corn."
Joshua,5,12,"And the manna ceased the day after, when they started eating the produce of the land, and there was no longer manna for the Israelites. They ate from the crop of the land of Canaan in that year."
Joshua,5,13,"And it happened, when Joshua was by Jericho, he looked up, and he saw a man standing opposite him with his sword drawn in his hand. And Joshua went to him and said, “Are you with us, or with our adversaries?”"
Joshua,5,14,"And he said, “Neither. I have come now as the commander of Yahweh’s army.” And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and he bowed down and said to him, “What is my lord commanding his servant?”"
Joshua,5,15,"The commander of Yahweh’s army said to Joshua, “Take off your sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy.” And Joshua did so."
Joshua,6,1,Now Jericho was shut up inside and out because of the presence of the Israelites; no one was going out or coming in.
Joshua,6,2,"And Yahweh said to Joshua, “Look, I am giving Jericho into your hand, its king and the soldiers of the army."
Joshua,6,3,"You will march around the city, all the warriors circling the city once; you will do so for six days."
Joshua,6,4,"And seven priests will bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark. On the seventh day you will march around the city seven times, and the priests will blow on the trumpets."
Joshua,6,5,"And when they blow long on the horn of the ram, when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people will shout with a great war cry, and the wall of the city will fall flat, and the people will charge, each one straight ahead.”"
Joshua,6,6,"So Joshua son of Nun summoned the priests and said to them, “Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests carry the trumpets of the rams’ horns before the ark of Yahweh.”"
Joshua,6,7,"And he said to the people, “Go forward and march around the city, and let the armed men pass before the ark of Yahweh."
Joshua,6,8,"And when Joshua spoke to the people, the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the presence of Yahweh went forward and they blew the trumpets; and the ark of the covenant of Yahweh followed behind them."
Joshua,6,9,"And the armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard came after the ark, while they were blowing the trumpets."
Joshua,6,10,"But Joshua commanded the people, saying, “You will not shout, and you will not let your voice be heard; a word will not go out from your mouth until the day I say to you ‘Shout!’ Then you will shout.”"
Joshua,6,11,"And the ark of Yahweh went around the city, circling once, and they came into the camp and spent the night in the camp."
Joshua,6,12,"Then Joshua got up early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of Yahweh."
Joshua,6,13,"The seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of the rams’ horns before the ark of Yahweh went on continually, and they blew on the trumpets. And the armed men went before them, and the rear guard came after the ark of Yahweh, while the trumpets blew continually."
Joshua,6,14,"And they marched around the city once on the second day, and they returned to the camp. They did this for six days."
Joshua,6,15,"Then on the seventh day they rose early at dawn, and they marched around the city in this manner seven times. It was only on that day that they marched around the city seven times."
Joshua,6,16,"And at the seventh time the priests blew on the trumpets, and Joshua said to the people, “Shout! For Yahweh has given you the city."
Joshua,6,17,"The city and all that is in it will be devoted to Yahweh; only Rahab the prostitute and all who are with her in the house will live, because she hid the messengers whom we sent."
Joshua,6,18,"As for you, keep away from the things devoted to destruction so that you do not take them and bring about your own destruction, making the camp of Israel an object for destruction, bringing trouble upon it."
Joshua,6,19,"But all of the silver and gold, and the items of bronze and iron, are holy to Yahweh, and they must go to Yahweh’s treasury.”"
Joshua,6,20,"So the people shouted, and they blew on the trumpets. And when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, they raised a great shout, and the wall fell flat. The people charged, each one straight ahead into the city, and they captured it."
Joshua,6,21,"And they utterly destroyed by the edge of the sword all who were in the city, both men and women, young and old, ox, sheep, and donkey."
Joshua,6,22,"Then Joshua said to the two men who spied on the land, “Go to the prostitute’s house and bring out from there the woman and all who belong to her, just as you swore to her.”"
Joshua,6,23,"So the young men who were spies went and brought Rahab and her father and mother, her brothers, and all who were with her. And they brought all her family out and set them outside the camp of Israel."
Joshua,6,24,"And they burned the city and all that was in it with fire; they put only the silver and gold, and the items of copper and iron, into the treasury of the house of Yahweh."
Joshua,6,25,"But Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute and her family and all who were with her, and she has lived in the midst of Israel until this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho."
Joshua,6,26,"And Joshua swore at that time, saying, “Cursed is anyone before Yahweh who gets up and builds Jericho, this city. At the cost of his firstborn he will lay its foundation, and at the cost of his youngest he will set up its gates.”"
Joshua,6,27,"So Yahweh was with Joshua, and his fame was in all the land."
Joshua,7,1,"But the Israelites broke faith concerning the devoted things. Achan son of Carmi son of Zabdi son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took from the devoted things; and Yahweh’s anger was kindled against the Israelites."
Joshua,7,2,"Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth Aven, east of Bethel, and he said to them, “Go up and spy out Ai.” And the men went up and spied out Ai."
Joshua,7,3,"And they returned to Joshua and said to him, “Do not let all the people go up and attack Ai; only two or three thousand men should go up because they are few. Do not make all the people weary up there.”"
Joshua,7,4,"So about three thousand from the people went up there, and they fled before the men of Ai."
Joshua,7,5,"The men of Ai killed about thirty-six of them, and they chased them from the gate up to Shebarim and killed them on the slope. And the hearts of the people melted and became like water."
Joshua,7,6,"And Joshua tore his clothes and fell to the ground on his face before the ark of Yahweh until the evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust on their heads."
Joshua,7,7,"And Joshua said, “Ah, my Lord! Why did you bring this people across the Jordan to give us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us? If only we had been content and stayed beyond the Jordan."
Joshua,7,8,"Please, my Lord! What can I say after Israel has fled from its enemies?"
Joshua,7,9,"The Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of this, and they will surround us and cut off our name from the land. What will you do, for your great name?”"
Joshua,7,10,"And Yahweh said to Joshua, “Stand up! Why have you fallen on your face?"
Joshua,7,11,"Israel has sinned and transgressed my covenant that I commanded them. They have taken from the devoted things; they have stolen and acted deceitfully, and they have put them among their belongings."
Joshua,7,12,The Israelites were unable to stand before their enemies; they fled from their enemies because they have become a thing devoted for destruction. I will be with you no more unless you destroy the devoted things from among you.
Joshua,7,13,"Get up, sanctify the people, and say, ‘Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow. Thus says Yahweh the God of Israel: “There are devoted things in your midst, O Israel. You will be unable to stand before you enemies until you remove the devoted things from your midst.”"
Joshua,7,14,"In the morning you will come forward, tribe by tribe, and the tribe that Yahweh will select by lot will come forward by clans, and the clan that Yahweh selects by lot will come forward by families, and the family that Yahweh selects by lot will come forward one by one."
Joshua,7,15,"The one caught with the devoted things will be burned with fire, he and all that belongs to him, because he transgressed the covenant of Yahweh, and because he did a disgraceful thing in Israel.” ’ ”"
Joshua,7,16,"So Joshua rose early in the morning and brought forward Israel, tribe by tribe, and the tribe of Judah was selected by lot."
Joshua,7,17,"And he brought forward the clans of Judah and selected the clan of the Zerahites by lot. Then he brought forward the clan of the Zerahites, one by one, and Zabdi was selected by lot."
Joshua,7,18,"He brought forward his family, one by one, and Achan son of Carmi son of Zabdi son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was selected by lot."
Joshua,7,19,"And Joshua said to Achan, “My son, please, give glory to Yahweh the God of Israel, and give him a doxology in court. Tell me, please, what you have done; do not hide it from me.”"
Joshua,7,20,"And Achan answered Joshua and said, “It is true. I have sinned against Yahweh the God of Israel, and this is what I did:"
Joshua,7,21,"I saw among the spoil a beautiful robe from Shinar, two hundred shekels of silver, and one bar of gold that weighed fifty shekels; I coveted them and took them. They are hidden in the ground inside my tent, and the silver is under it.”"
Joshua,7,22,"Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and there they were, hidden in his tent, and the silver was under it."
Joshua,7,23,And they took them from the tent and brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites. And they spread them out before the presence of Yahweh.
Joshua,7,24,"Then Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan son of Zerah, the silver, the robe, the bar of gold, his sons and daughters, his cattle and donkeys, his sheep, his tent, and everything that was his, and they brought them to the valley of Achor."
Joshua,7,25,"And Joshua said, “Why did you bring us trouble? Yahweh will bring you trouble on this day.” And all Israel stoned them with stones; and they burned them with fire after they stoned them with stones."
Joshua,7,26,"Then they placed on top of him a great pile of stones that remains to this day. And Yahweh turned from his burning anger, and thus the name of that place to this day is called the valley of Achor."
Joshua,8,1,"Then Yahweh said to Joshua, “Do not fear or be dismayed. Take all the fighting men with you and go up immediately to Ai. Look, I am giving into your hand the king of Ai, his city, and his land."
Joshua,8,2,You will do to Ai and its king that which you did to Jericho and its king; you may take only its spoils and livestock as booty for yourself. Set for yourself an ambush against the city from behind it.”
Joshua,8,3,So Joshua and all the fighting men went up immediately to Ai. Joshua chose thirty thousand of the best fighting men and sent them by night.
Joshua,8,4,"And he commanded them, saying, “Look, you are to lay an ambush against the city from behind. Do not go very far from the city and be ready."
Joshua,8,5,"Then I and all of the people who are with me will approach the city. And when they go out to meet us as before, we will flee from them."
Joshua,8,6,"They will come out after us until we draw them away from the city, because they will think, ‘They are fleeing from us as before.’ So we will flee from them."
Joshua,8,7,"Then you will rise up from the ambush and take possession of the city, for Yahweh your God will give it into your hand."
Joshua,8,8,"And when you capture the city you will set it on fire as Yahweh commanded. Look, I have commanded you.”"
Joshua,8,9,"So Joshua sent them out, and they went to the place of the ambush, and they sat between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai; but Joshua spent the night with the people."
Joshua,8,10,"Joshua rose early in the morning and mustered the people, and he went up with the elders of Israel before the people of Ai."
Joshua,8,11,All the fighting men who were with him went up and drew near before the city and camped north of Ai; there was a valley between him and Ai.
Joshua,8,12,"And he took about five thousand men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city."
Joshua,8,13,So they stationed the forces; all the army was north of the city while the rear guard was west. But Joshua went that night to the middle of the valley.
Joshua,8,14,"When the king of Ai saw this, the men of the city hurried and rose early and went out to meet Israel for battle—he and all his army—to the meeting place before the Arabah. He did not know that there was an ambush for him behind the city."
Joshua,8,15,"Then Joshua and all Israel acted like they were beaten before them, and they fled in the direction of the wilderness."
Joshua,8,16,"All of the people who were in the city were called to pursue after them. As they pursued after Joshua, they were drawn away from the city."
Joshua,8,17,Not a man remained in Ai or Bethel who had not gone out after Israel; they left the city open and pursued after Israel.
Joshua,8,18,"And Yahweh said to Joshua, “Stretch out the sword that is in your hand to Ai, because I will give it into your hand.” And Joshua stretched out the sword that was in his hand to the city."
Joshua,8,19,"The moment he stretched out his hand, those in the ambush stood up quickly from their place and ran. And they went into the city and captured it, quickly setting the city ablaze with fire."
Joshua,8,20,"Then the men of Ai looked behind them, and they saw smoke from the city rising to the sky; they had no power to flee this way or that, and the people fleeing the wilderness turned around to the pursuers."
Joshua,8,21,And Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had captured the city and that the smoke of the city was rising; they returned and struck down the men of Ai.
Joshua,8,22,"Then the others from the city came out to meet them, and they found themselves surrounded by Israel, some on one side, and others on the other side. And they struck them down until no survivor or fugitive was left."
Joshua,8,23,"But they captured the king of Ai alive, and they brought him to Joshua."
Joshua,8,24,"When Israel finished slaughtering all the inhabitants of Ai in the open field, in the wilderness where they pursued them, and when all of them had fallen by the edge of the sword until they all had perished, all Israel returned to Ai and attacked it with the edge of the sword."
Joshua,8,25,"All the people that fell on that day, both men and women, were twelve thousand—all the inhabitants of Ai."
Joshua,8,26,For Joshua did not draw back his hand that was stretched out with the sword until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.
Joshua,8,27,"Only the livestock and the spoil of that city Israel took as booty for themselves, according to the word of Yahweh that Joshua commanded."
Joshua,8,28,"So Joshua burned Ai and made it an everlasting heap of rubbish, a desolate place until this day."
Joshua,8,29,"The king of Ai he hanged on a tree until the time of evening, and as the sun went down Joshua commanded them, and they brought down his dead body from the tree. Then they threw it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and they raised over it a great heap of stones that remains to this day."
Joshua,8,30,"Then Joshua built an altar on Mount Ebal for Yahweh the God of Israel,"
Joshua,8,31,"as Moses Yahweh’s servant commanded the Israelites, as it is written in the scroll of the law of Moses: “an altar of unhewn stones on which no one has wielded an iron implement.” And they offered burnt offerings on it and sacrificed fellowship offerings."
Joshua,8,32,"And there Joshua wrote on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he had written, in the presence of the Israelites."
Joshua,8,33,"Then all Israel, foreigner as well as native, with the elders, officials, and judges stood on either side of the ark before the priests and the Levites, who carried the ark of the covenant of Yahweh. Half of them stood in front of Mount Gerizim, and the other half in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses Yahweh’s servant had commanded before to bless the people of Israel."
Joshua,8,34,"And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and the curses, according to all that was written in the scroll of the law."
Joshua,8,35,"There was not a word from all that Moses commanded that Joshua did not read before the assembly of all Israel, and the women, the little children, and the traveling foreigners among them."
Joshua,9,1,"Now when all the kings who were beyond the Jordan in the hill country and in the Shephelah, and on all the coast of the great sea toward Lebanon —the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites —heard of this,"
Joshua,9,2,they gathered themselves together to fight with one accord against Joshua and Israel.
Joshua,9,3,"But the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua did to Jericho and Ai,"
Joshua,9,4,"and they acted on their part with cunning: they went and prepared provisions, and took worn-out sacks for their donkeys and old wineskins that were torn and mended."
Joshua,9,5,"The sandals on their feet were patched and old, their clothes were old, and their food was dry and crumbled."
Joshua,9,6,"And they went to Joshua at the camp at Gilgal and said to him and to the men of Israel, “We have come from a far land; so then make a covenant with us.”"
Joshua,9,7,"And the men of Israel said to the Hivites, “Perhaps you are living among us; how can we make a covenant with you?”"
Joshua,9,8,"They said to Joshua, “We are your servants.” And Joshua said to them, “Who are you, and from where do you come?”"
Joshua,9,9,"And they said to him, “Your servants have come from a very far land because of the name of Yahweh your God; we have heard of his reputation, of all that he did in Egypt,"
Joshua,9,10,"and of all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan—to Sihon king of Heshbon and to Og king of Bashan, who was in Ashtaroth."
Joshua,9,11,"So our elders said to us and all the inhabitants of our land, ‘Take in your hand provisions for the journey, and go to meet them, and say to them, “We are your servants; so then make a covenant with us.” ’"
Joshua,9,12,"This is our bread; it was hot when we took it from our houses as provisions on the day we set out to come to you. But now, look, it is dry and crumbled."
Joshua,9,13,"These are the wineskins that we filled new, but look, they have burst; and these are our clothes and sandals that have worn out from the very long journey.”"
Joshua,9,14,"So the leaders took from their provisions, but they did not ask direction from Yahweh."
Joshua,9,15,"And Joshua made peace with them, and he made a covenant with them to allow them to live happily, and the leaders of the congregation swore an oath to them."
Joshua,9,16,"And it happened that at the end of three days, after they made a covenant with them, they heard that they were their neighbors and living among them."
Joshua,9,17,"And the Israelites set out and went to their cities on the third day (their cities were Gibeon, Kephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath Jearim)."
Joshua,9,18,"But the Israelites did not attack them, because the leaders of the congregation had sworn to them by Yahweh the God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against their leaders."
Joshua,9,19,"But all the leaders of the congregation said, “We have sworn to them by Yahweh the God of Israel, and so we cannot touch them."
Joshua,9,20,This we will do to them: we will let them live so that wrath will not be on us because of the oath we swore to them.”
Joshua,9,21,"And the leaders said to them, “Let them live.” So they became woodcutters and water carriers for all the congregation, just as the leaders had said to them."
Joshua,9,22,"And Joshua summoned them and said, “Why have you deceived us saying, ‘We are very far from you’ when you are living among us?"
Joshua,9,23,Therefore you are cursed; some of you will always be slaves as woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my God.”
Joshua,9,24,"And they answered Joshua and said, “Because it was told with certainty to your servants that Yahweh your God commanded Moses his servant to give to you all the land and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land before you, so we were very afraid for our lives because of you, and so we did this thing."
Joshua,9,25,"So then, look, we are in your hand; do with us whatever seems good and right in your eyes.”"
Joshua,9,26,"So he did this to them: he saved them from the hand of the Israelites, and they did not kill them."
Joshua,9,27,"And that day Joshua made them woodcutters and water carriers for the congregation and for the altar of Yahweh, to this day, in the place that he should choose."
Joshua,10,1,"And it happened that when Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua captured Ai and had utterly destroyed it (just as he had done to Jericho and its king, so he did to Ai and its king) and that the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were among them,"
Joshua,10,2,"he became very afraid because Gibeon was a very large city, like one of the royal cities, and because it was larger than Ai, and all its men were mighty warriors."
Joshua,10,3,"So Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sent word to Hohman king of Hebron, to Piram king of Jarmuth, to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,"
Joshua,10,4,"“Come up and help me, and let us attack Gibeon, because it has made peace with Joshua and the Israelites.”"
Joshua,10,5,"And the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon, gathered together and went up, they and all their forces, and they laid siege to Gibeon and made war against it."
Joshua,10,6,"And the men of Gibeon sent word to Joshua at the camp at Gilgal, saying, “Do not abandon your servant. Come up to us quickly and save us! Help us, for all the kings of the Amorites who dwell in the hill country have gathered against us.”"
Joshua,10,7,"So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and all the fighting men with him, all the best warriors."
Joshua,10,8,"And Yahweh said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid of them, for I have given them into your hand; no one will withstand you."
Joshua,10,9,Joshua came upon them suddenly by marching up all night from Gilgal.
Joshua,10,10,"And Yahweh threw them into panic before Israel, who struck them with a great blow at Gibeon and pursued them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon and struck them as far as Azekah and Makkedah."
Joshua,10,11,"And as they were fleeing from Israel, they were on the slope of Beth-horon, and Yahweh threw huge stones from the heavens on them as far as Azekah; and more died by the hail stones than those whom the Israelites killed by the sword."
Joshua,10,12,"Then Joshua spoke to Yahweh, on the day Yahweh gave the Amorites over to the Israelites, and he said in the sight of Israel, “Sun in Gibeon, stand still, and moon, in the valley of Aijalon.”"
Joshua,10,13,"And the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, until the nation took vengeance on its enemies. Is it not written in the scroll of Jashar? The sun stood still in the middle of the heaven and was not in haste to set for about a full day."
Joshua,10,14,"There has not been a day like this before it or after, that Yahweh listened to the voice of a man; for Yahweh fought for Israel."
Joshua,10,15,And Joshua returned and all Israel with him to the camp at Gilgal.
Joshua,10,16,But these five kings fled and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah.
Joshua,10,17,"And it was told to Joshua, saying, “The five kings were found hidden in the cave at Makkedah.”"
Joshua,10,18,"And Joshua said, “Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave, and set men in front of it to guard them."
Joshua,10,19,"But do not stay there; pursue after your enemies and attack them from the rear. Do not allow them to go into their cities, for Yahweh your God has given them into your hand.”"
Joshua,10,20,"When Joshua and the Israelites had finished striking them with a very great blow, until they perished, those of them who survived went into the fortified cities,"
Joshua,10,21,and all the people returned to the camp safely to Joshua at Makkedah. No one spoke against the Israelites.
Joshua,10,22,"And Joshua said, “Open the mouth of the cave, and bring to me those five kings from the cave.”"
Joshua,10,23,"And they did so, and brought him these five kings from the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon."
Joshua,10,24,"And when they brought these kings to Joshua, Joshua called all the men of Israel and said to the commanders of the fighting men who had gone with him, “Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings.” So they came near and put their feet on their necks."
Joshua,10,25,"And Joshua said to them, “Do not be afraid or dismayed! Be strong and bold, for thus Yahweh will do to all your enemies whom you are about to fight."
Joshua,10,26,"And after this Joshua struck them down and killed them, and he hanged them on five trees. And they were hanging on the trees until the evening."
Joshua,10,27,"And it happened at the time of sunset, Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees and threw them into the cave where they had hidden themselves, and they put large stones against the mouth of the cave, which are there to this very day."
Joshua,10,28,"Joshua captured Makkedah on that day, and he struck it and its king with the edge of the sword; he utterly destroyed it and everyone that was in it. He did not leave behind a survivor. So he did to the king of Makkedah just as he did to the king of Jericho."
Joshua,10,29,"And Joshua passed on, and all of Israel with him, from Makkedah to Libnah, and he fought against Libnah."
Joshua,10,30,"And Yahweh also gave it into the hand of Israel, and its king and all the people in it he struck with the edge of the sword. He left in it no survivor. He did to its king just as he did to the king of Jericho."
Joshua,10,31,"And Joshua passed on, and all of Israel with him, from Libnah to Lachish, and he laid siege to it and fought against it."
Joshua,10,32,"And Yahweh gave Lachish into the hand of Israel, and he captured it on the second day. He struck it with the edge of the sword, and everyone in it, just as he did to Libnah."
Joshua,10,33,"Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish, and Joshua struck him and his people until he left no survivor behind."
Joshua,10,34,"And Joshua passed on, and all of Israel with him, from Lachish to Eglon, and they laid siege to it and fought against it."
Joshua,10,35,"And they captured it on that day, and he struck it with the edge of the sword, and all the people that were in it on that day he utterly destroyed as he had done to Lachish."
Joshua,10,36,"And Joshua went up, and all Israel with him, from Eglon to Hebron, and they fought against it"
Joshua,10,37,"and captured it, and they struck it with the edge of the sword, its king and all its cities, and all the people that were in it; he left behind no survivor, as he had done to Eglon, and he utterly destroyed it and all the people that were in it."
Joshua,10,38,"Then Joshua returned to Debir, and all of Israel with him, and they fought against it,"
Joshua,10,39,"and he captured it and its king and all its cities, and they struck them with the the edge of the sword, and they utterly destroyed all the people that were in it; he left behind no survivor, just as he had done to Hebron. Thus he did to Debir and its king what he had done to Libnah and its king."
Joshua,10,40,"So Joshua struck all the land—the hill country, the Negev, the Shephelah, and the slopes —and all their kings; he left behind no survivor, and all that breathed he utterly destroyed as Yahweh the God of Israel commanded."
Joshua,10,41,"Joshua struck them from Kadesh Barnea to Gaza, and all the land of Goshen up to Gibeon;"
Joshua,10,42,"all of these kings and their land Joshua captured at one time, because Yahweh the God of Israel fought for Israel."
Joshua,10,43,"And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal."
Joshua,11,1,"And it happened, when Jabin king of Hazor heard this, he sent to Jobab king of Madon, to the king of Shimron, to the king of Acshaph,"
Joshua,11,2,"and to the kings who were in the north in the hill country, in the Arabah south of Kinnereth, in the Shephelah, and in Naphoth Dor in the west,"
Joshua,11,3,"to the Canaanites in the east and west, the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, and the Jebusites in the hill country, and the Hivites at the foot of Hermon in the land of Mizpah."
Joshua,11,4,"They came out, they and all their armies with them, as a great army like the sand on the seashore, with very many horses and chariots."
Joshua,11,5,"And all these kings joined forces, and they came and camped together by the waters of Merom to fight with Israel."
Joshua,11,6,"And Yahweh said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid because of their presence, for tomorrow at this time I will hand them over slain to Israel; you will hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire.”"
Joshua,11,7,"So Joshua, and all the fighting men with him, came against them suddenly at the waters of Merom, and they attacked them."
Joshua,11,8,"And Yahweh gave them into the hand of Israel, and they struck them and pursued them up to Great Sidon and Misrephoth Maim, and eastward up to the valley of Mizpeh. And they struck them until they left behind no survivor."
Joshua,11,9,And Joshua did to them as Yahweh commanded him; he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire.
Joshua,11,10,"Then Joshua turned back at that time, and he captured Hazor and struck its king with the sword, because Hazor formerly was the head of all these kingdoms."
Joshua,11,11,"He struck all the people that were in it with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them. There was no one left who breathed, and he burned Hazor with fire."
Joshua,11,12,"And Joshua captured all the cities of these kings, and all their kings, and he utterly destroyed them with the edge of the sword, as Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded."
Joshua,11,13,"Israel did not burn the cities standing on their mounds, except Hazor alone, which Joshua burned."
Joshua,11,14,"And all the spoil and livestock of these cities the Israelites took as booty; they struck the people with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them—they left behind no one who breathed."
Joshua,11,15,"Just as Yahweh commanded Moses his servant, so Moses commanded Joshua, and Joshua did; he left nothing undone that Yahweh had commanded Moses."
Joshua,11,16,"So Joshua took all this land: the hill country, all the Negev, all the land of Goshen, the Shephelah, the Arabah, and the hill country of Israel and its Shephelah,"
Joshua,11,17,"from Mount Halak that rises to Seir and to Baal Gad in the valley of Lebanon at the foot of Mount Hermon; he captured all their kings, struck them, and killed them."
Joshua,11,18,For many days Joshua made war with all these kings.
Joshua,11,19,There was not a city that made peace with the Israelites besides the Hivites and the inhabitants of Gibeon—all were taken in battle.
Joshua,11,20,"For it was Yahweh that hardened their hearts, to meet Israel in war in order to utterly destroy them without mercy, that they would destroy them just as Yahweh commanded Moses."
Joshua,11,21,"At that time Joshua came and exterminated the Anakites from the hill country, from Hebron, Debir, Anab, and from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel; Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities."
Joshua,11,22,"None of the Anakites were left in the land of the Israelites; some remained only in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod."
Joshua,11,23,"Joshua took all the land according to all that Yahweh had spoken to Moses; and Joshua gave it as an inheritance to Israel, according to their tribal divisions, and the land rested from war."
Joshua,12,1,"These are the kings of the land whom the Israelites defeated, and of whose land they took possession beyond the Jordon to the east, from the wadi of Arnon up to Mount Hermon, and all the Arabah to the east:"
Joshua,12,2,"Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is on the edge of the wadi of Arnon, from the middle of the valley and half of Gilead, up to the Jabbok River, which marks the border of the Ammonites;"
Joshua,12,3,"and the Arabah up to the Kinnereth Sea to the east, and as far as the sea of Arabah, the Salt Sea to the east, in the direction of Beth Jeshimoth, and to the area southward, at the foot of the slopes of Pisgah;"
Joshua,12,4,"the territory of Og king of Bashan, one of the last of the Rephaites, who lived at Ashtaroth and Edrei"
Joshua,12,5,"and ruled over Mount Hermon and Salecah and over all Bashan up to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and half of Gilead, as far as the border of Sihon king of Heshbon."
Joshua,12,6,"Moses Yahweh’s servant and the Israelites defeated them; and Moses Yahweh’s servant gave it as a possession to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh."
Joshua,12,7,"These are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the Israelites defeated beyond to the Jordan to the west, from Baal Gad in the valley of Lebanon, and up to Mount Halak, which rises to Seir. And Joshua gave it as a possession to the tribes of Israel according to their allotments,"
Joshua,12,8,"in the hill country, the Shephelah, the Arabah, on the slopes, in the wilderness, and in the Negev; the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites:"
Joshua,12,9,"the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;"
Joshua,12,10,"the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;"
Joshua,12,11,"the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;"
Joshua,12,12,"the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;"
Joshua,12,13,"the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;"
Joshua,12,14,"the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;"
Joshua,12,15,"the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;"
Joshua,12,16,"the king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;"
Joshua,12,17,"the king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;"
Joshua,12,18,"the king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one;"
Joshua,12,19,"the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;"
Joshua,12,20,"the king of Shimron-meron, one; the king of Acshaph, one;"
Joshua,12,21,"the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;"
Joshua,12,22,"the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one;"
Joshua,12,23,"the king of Dor in Naphath Dor, one; the king of Goiim for Gilgal, one;"
Joshua,12,24,"the king of Tirzah, one; all the kings, thirty-one."
Joshua,13,1,"Now Joshua was old and advanced in years, and Yahweh said to him, “You are old and advanced in years, and very much of the land remains to be possessed."
Joshua,13,2,"This is the remaining land: all the regions of the Philistines, and all of the Geshurites,"
Joshua,13,3,"from the Shihor, which is east of Egypt, up to the border of Ekron to the north, which is reckoned as Canaanite; there are five Philistine rulers: the Gazites, Ashdodites, Ashkelonites, Gittites, Ekronites, and the Avvim."
Joshua,13,4,"In the south; all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah, which belongs to the Sidonians up to Aphek, to the border of the Amorites,"
Joshua,13,5,"and the land of the Gebalites, and all the Lebanon, toward the east, from Baal Gad at the foot of Mount Hermon up to Lebo-Hamath;"
Joshua,13,6,"all the inhabitants of the hill country, from the Lebanon up to Misrephoth Maim, and all the Sidonians. I will drive them out from before the Israelites; only allocate it to Israel as an inheritance just as I have commanded you."
Joshua,13,7,"Therefore, divide this land as an inheritance to the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh.”"
Joshua,13,8,"With it the Reubenites, and the Gadites received their inheritance, which Moses gave them beyond the Jordan to the east, just as Moses Yahweh’s servant gave to them:"
Joshua,13,9,"from Aroer, which is on the edge of the wadi of Arnon, and the city which is in the middle of the wadi, and all the plateau from Medeba up to Dibon;"
Joshua,13,10,"and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon up to the border of the Ammonites;"
Joshua,13,11,"and Gilead, and the border of the Geshurite and the Maacathites, all of Mount Hermon, and Bashan up to Salecah;"
Joshua,13,12,"all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei—he was left over from the survivors of the Rephaim; these Moses had defeated and driven out."
Joshua,13,13,But the Israelites did not drive out the Geshurites or the Maacathites; Geshur and Maacah live among Israel to this day.
Joshua,13,14,"Only the tribe of Levites Moses did not give an inheritance; the offerings made by fire to Yahweh the God of Israel are their inheritance, just as he promised to them."
Joshua,13,15,Moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of the descendants of Reuben according to their families.
Joshua,13,16,"Their territory was from Aroer, which was on the edge of the wadi of Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the plateau by Medeba;"
Joshua,13,17,"Heshbon and its cities that are on the plateau; Dibon, Bamoth Baal, Beth Baal Meon,"
Joshua,13,18,"Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath,"
Joshua,13,19,"Kiriathaim, Sibmah, and Zereth Shahar on the hill of the valley;"
Joshua,13,20,"Beth Peor, the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth Jeshimoth;"
Joshua,13,21,"all of the cities of the plateau, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon and whom Moses defeated with the leaders of Midian, Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, the princes of Sihon who dwelled in the land."
Joshua,13,22,"In addition to their slain, the Israelites killed with the sword Balaam son of Beor, who practiced divination."
Joshua,13,23,"And the border of the descendants of Reuben was the Jordan and its banks. This was the inheritance of the descendants of Reuben according to their families, the cities, and their villages."
Joshua,13,24,"Moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of Gad, to the descendants of Gad, according to their families."
Joshua,13,25,"Their territory was Jazer and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the Ammonites up to Aroer, which is east of Rabbah;"
Joshua,13,26,"and from Heshbon up to Ramah-Mizpeh and Betonim, and from Mahanaim up to the territory to Debir;"
Joshua,13,27,"in the valley of Beth Haram, Beth Nimrah, Succoth, Zaphon, and the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, the Jordan and its banks, up to the lower end of the Kinnereth Sea beyond the Jordan to the east."
Joshua,13,28,"This is the inheritance of the Gadites according to their families, the cities, and their villages."
Joshua,13,29,Moses gave an inheritance to the half-tribe of Manasseh; it was for the half-tribe of the descendants of Manasseh according to their families.
Joshua,13,30,"Their territory was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the settlements of Jair, which are in Bashan, sixty cities,"
Joshua,13,31,"and half of Gilead, with Ashtaroth, Edrei, and the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan; these were allotted to the children of Makir son of Manasseh, for half of the children of Makir according to their families."
Joshua,13,32,"These are the territories that Moses gave as an inheritance on the desert-plateau of Moab, beyond the Jordan, east of Jericho."
Joshua,13,33,"But to the tribe of Levi Moses did not give an inheritance; Yahweh the God of Israel, he is their inheritance, just as he promised them."
Joshua,14,1,"These are the territories that the Israelites inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the families of the tribes of the Israelites gave as an inheritance to them."
Joshua,14,2,"Their inheritance was by lot, just as Yahweh commanded through the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes and the half-tribe."
Joshua,14,3,"For Moses had given an inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Jordan, but to the Levites he gave no inheritance among them."
Joshua,14,4,"For the descendants of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim, and they did not give a plot of ground to the Levites in the land, only cities to live in, with their pastureland for their flocks and for their goods."
Joshua,14,5,"Just as Yahweh commanded Moses, so the Israelites did; and they allotted the land."
Joshua,14,6,"Then the descendants of Judah came to Joshua at Gilgal; and Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, “You know the word that Yahweh said to Moses the man of God at Kadesh Barnea concerning you and me."
Joshua,14,7,"I was forty years old when Moses Yahweh’s servant sent me from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land, and I returned with an honest report."
Joshua,14,8,"My companions who went up with me made the hearts of the people melt, but I remained true to Yahweh my God."
Joshua,14,9,"And Moses swore on that day, saying, ‘Surely the land that your foot has trodden on will be an inheritance to you and your sons forever, because you remained true to Yahweh my God.’"
Joshua,14,10,"So then, look, Yahweh has kept me alive just as he promised these forty-five years, from the time that Yahweh spoke this word to Moses while Israel wandered in the wilderness. Now look, today I am eighty-five years old."
Joshua,14,11,"Today I am still strong, just as on the day that Moses sent me; as my strength was then, so now also is my strength for war and for daily activities."
Joshua,14,12,"So now give me this hill country that Yahweh spoke of on that day, for you heard on that day that the Anakites were there, with great and fortified cities. Perhaps Yahweh is with me, and I will drive them out just as Yahweh promised.”"
Joshua,14,13,And Joshua blessed him and gave Hebron to Caleb son of Jephunneh as an inheritance.
Joshua,14,14,"Thus Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day, because he remained true to Yahweh the God of Israel."
Joshua,14,15,And the name of Hebron formerly was Kiriath Arba; Arba was the greatest person among the Anakites. And the land rested from war.
Joshua,15,1,"The allotment for the tribe of the descendants of Judah according to their families reached to the border of Edom, to the wilderness of Zin, to the far south."
Joshua,15,2,"Their southern border was from the end of the Salt Sea, from the bay facing southward;"
Joshua,15,3,"it continues to the south to the ascent of Akrabbim, passes along to Zin, it goes up south of Kadesh Barnea, passes along Hezron, goes up to Addar, and makes a turn to Karka;"
Joshua,15,4,"it passes on to Azmon, continues by the wadi of Egypt, and it ends at the sea. This will be your southern border."
Joshua,15,5,The eastern border is the Salt Sea up to the mouth of the Jordan. The border on the northern side runs from the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan;
Joshua,15,6,the border goes up to Beth-hoglah and passes along north of Beth Arabah; and the border goes up the stone of Bohan son of Reuben;
Joshua,15,7,"and the border goes up to Debir from the valley of Achor, and to the north, turning to Gilgal, which is opposite the ascent of Adummim, which is south of the wadi; and the border passes on to the waters of En Shemesh, and it ends at En Rogel."
Joshua,15,8,"Then the border goes up by the Valley of Ben Hinnom to the slope of the Jebusites from the south (that is, Jerusalem); and the border goes up to the top of the mountain that lies opposite the valley of Hinnom to the west, which is at the end of the valley of Rephaim to the north;"
Joshua,15,9,"then the border turns from the top of the mountain to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah, and continues from there to the cities of Mount Ephron; the border then turns to Baalah (that is, Kiriath Jearim);"
Joshua,15,10,"and the border goes around from Baalah to the west, to Mount Seir, and passes on to the slope of Mount Jearim from the north (that is, Kesalon), and goes down to Beth Shemesh, and passes along by Timnah."
Joshua,15,11,"The border continues to the slope of Ekron to the north, then bends around to Shikkeron, it passes on to Mount Baalah and continues to Jabneel; and the border ends at the sea."
Joshua,15,12,And the western border is to the Great Sea and its coast. This is the border surrounding the descendants of Judah according to their families.
Joshua,15,13,"According to the commandment of Yahweh to Joshua, he gave to Caleb son of Jephunneh a plot of ground among the descendants of Judah, Kiriath Arba, which is Hebron (Arba was Anak’s father)."
Joshua,15,14,"Caleb drove out from there three of Anak’s sons, Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, the descendants of Anak."
Joshua,15,15,And from there he went up against the inhabitants of Debir (the former name of Debir was Kiriath Sepher).
Joshua,15,16,"And Caleb said, “Whoever attacks Kiriath Sepher and captures it, I will give to him my daughter Acsah as a wife.”"
Joshua,15,17,"Othniel son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, captured it, and he gave to him Acsah his daughter as a wife."
Joshua,15,18,"When she came to him she urged him to ask her father for a field. So she dismounted from the donkey, and Caleb said to her, “What do you want?”"
Joshua,15,19,"And she said to him, “Give to me a gift; you have given me the land of the Negev, and you must give to me a spring of water.” And he gave to her the upper and lower spring."

Joshua,15,63,"But the descendants of Judah were unable to drive out the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so the Jebusites live with the descendants of Judah in Jerusalem to this day."
Joshua,16,1,"The allotment of the descendants of Joseph went from the Jordan by Jericho, at the waters of Jericho to the east, into the wilderness, going up from Jericho into the hill country to Bethel;"
Joshua,16,2,"it continues from Bethel to Luz, and it passes along to the territory of the Arkites at Ataroth."
Joshua,16,3,"Then it goes down, to the west, to the territory of the Japhletites, up to the territory of Lower Beth-horon, then to Gezer, and it ends at the sea."
Joshua,16,4,"And the descendants of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, received their inheritance."
Joshua,16,5,"This was the border of the descendants of Ephraim according to their families: the border of their inheritance to the east was Ataroth Addar, up to Upper Beth-horon."
Joshua,16,6,"The border continues to the sea; from Micmethath to the north, the border turns to the east to Taanath Shiloh, and it passes along it from the east to Janoah."
Joshua,16,7,Then it goes down from Janoah to Ataroth and to Naarah; it touches Jericho and ends at the Jordan;
Joshua,16,8,"from Tappuah the border goes to the west, to the wadi of Kanah, and it ends at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the descendants of Ephraim according to their families,"
Joshua,16,9,"with the cities that were set apart for the descendants of Ephraim in the midst of the inheritance of the descendants of Manasseh, all the cities and their villages."
Joshua,16,10,"But they did not drive out the Canananites who were dwelling in Gezer, and so the Canaanites live in the midst of Ephraim to this day, but they became forced laborers."
Joshua,17,1,"Then the allotment was made for the tribe of Manasseh, because he was the firstborn of Joseph. To Makir, the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, were allotted Gilead and Bashan, because he was a warrior."
Joshua,17,2,"An allotment was made for the remaining descendants of Manasseh, according to their families: For the children of Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida—these were the male descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph according to their families."
Joshua,17,3,"But Zelophehad son of Hepher, son of Gilead, son of Makir, son of Manasseh, had no sons, only daughters. These are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah."
Joshua,17,4,"They came before Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the leaders, saying, “Yahweh commanded Moses to give an inheritance to us among our kinsmen.” Therefore, according to the command of Yahweh he gave them an inheritance among the kinsmen of their father."
Joshua,17,5,"Thus ten shares fell to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan,"
Joshua,17,6,because the daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance among his sons. And the land of Gilead was allotted to the remaining descendants of Manasseh.
Joshua,17,7,"The border of Manasseh was from Asher to Micmethath, which is opposite Shechem; then the border goes to the south, to the inhabitants of En Tappuah."
Joshua,17,8,"The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, but Tuppuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the descendants of Ephraim."
Joshua,17,9,"Then the border goes down to the wadi of Kanah to the south of the wadi. These cities belong to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh. The border of Manasseh is north of the wadi, and it ends at the sea."
Joshua,17,10,"The south is Ephraim’s, and the north is Manasseh’s; the sea is their border; Asher touches the north and on the east Issachar."
Joshua,17,11,"In Issachar and Asher, Manasseh had Beth-shean and its villages, Ibleam and its villages, the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, the inhabitants of En-dor and its villages, the inhabitants of Taanach and its villages, the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages; the third is Napheth."
Joshua,17,12,But the descendants of Manasseh were not able to take possession of these towns; the Canaanites were determined to live in this land.
Joshua,17,13,"And it happened, when the Israelites grew strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor but never drove them out completely."
Joshua,17,14,"The descendants of Joseph spoke with Joshua, saying, “Why have you given us one allotment and one share as an inheritance? We are many people, which Yahweh has blessed.”"
Joshua,17,15,"And Joshua said to them, “If you are many people, go up to the forest and clear a place there for yourselves in the land of the Perizzites and Rephaim, since the hill country of Ephraim is too narrow for you.”"
Joshua,17,16,"And the descendants of Joseph said, “The hill country is not enough for us, and all of the Canaanites living in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, those in Beth-shean and its villages, and those in the Jezreel Valley.”"
Joshua,17,17,"And Joshua said to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and Manasseh, “You are many people and have great power; you will not have one allotment only;"
Joshua,17,18,"the hill country will be yours. Even though it is a forest, you will clear it, and it will be yours to its farthest borders. You will drive out the Canaanites, even though they have iron chariots and are strong.”"
Joshua,18,1,"The entire congregation of the Israelites assembled at Shiloh, and they set up there the tent of meeting, and the land was subdued before them."
Joshua,18,2,And seven tribes remained among the Israelites who had not been apportioned their inheritance.
Joshua,18,3,"And Joshua said to the Israelites, “How long will you be slack about going to take possession of the land that Yahweh, the God of your ancestors, has given you?"
Joshua,18,4,"Provide three men from each tribe, and I will send them so that they may begin to go through the land and write a description of it according to their inheritance, and let them come to me."
Joshua,18,5,"They will divide it among themselves into seven portions; Judah will maintain its border from the south, and the house of Joseph will maintain its border from the north."
Joshua,18,6,"Describe the land in seven divisions, and bring it to me here; I will cast lots for you here before Yahweh our God."
Joshua,18,7,"The Levites among you have no portion, for their inheritance is the priesthood of Yahweh; Gad, Reuben, and the half-tribe of Manasseh received their inheritance beyond the Jordan to the east, which Moses Yahweh’s servant gave to them.”"
Joshua,18,8,"And the men went immediately, and Joshua commanded the ones going to describe the land, saying, “Go and walk about through the land, write a description, and return to me, and here I will cast a lot for you before Yahweh at Shiloh.”"
Joshua,18,9,"And the men went and passed through the land, and they described the cities in seven divisions in a book; and they came to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh,"
Joshua,18,10,"and Joshua cast a lot for them at Shiloh before Yahweh, and there he divided the land for the Israelites, to each a portion."
Joshua,18,11,"And the allotment of the tribe of Benjamin came up according to their families, and the border of their allotment fell between the descendants of Judah and the descendants of Joseph."
Joshua,18,12,Their northern border began at the Jordan and went up to the slope of Jericho on the north and continued into the hill country to the west; it ends at the wilderness of Beth Aven.
Joshua,18,13,"The border passes on from there to Luz, to the slope of Luz to the south (that is, Bethel); then the border goes down to Ataroth Addar to the mountain that is south of Lower Beth-Horon."
Joshua,18,14,"Then the border changes direction and turns to the western side southward, from the mountain that is opposite Beth-Horon to the south. It ends at Kiriath Baal (that is, Kiriath Jearim), a town belonging to the descendants of Judah. This is the western side."
Joshua,18,15,"The southern side begins on the outskirts of Kiriath Jearim, and the border continues to the west to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah;"
Joshua,18,16,"the border goes down to the foot of the mountain, which is opposite the Valley of Ben Hinnom, which is in the valley of Rephaim to the north; then it does down the valley of Hinnom to the slope of the Jebusites to the south, and then it goes down to En Rogel."
Joshua,18,17,"It changes direction from the north, and it continues to En Shemesh; it goes out to Geliloth, which is opposite the ascent of Adummim, and it goes down to the stone of Bohan, son of Reuben."
Joshua,18,18,"It passes on to the slope opposite the Arabah to the north, and it goes down to the Arabah."
Joshua,18,19,The border passes on to the slope of Beth-hoglah to the north and ends at the north bay of the Salt Sea at the south end of the Jordan. This is the southern border.
Joshua,18,20,"The Jordan forms its border on the eastern side. This is the inheritance of the tribe of Benjamin, its borders that surrounds them, according to their families."

Joshua,19,9,"Part of the portion allotted to the descendants of Judah became the inheritance of the descendants of Simeon because the portion for the descendants of Judah was too large for them, so the descendants of Simeon inherited from their inheritance."
Joshua,19,10,The third allotment came up for the descendants of Zebulun according to their families. The border of their inheritance went up to Sarid.
Joshua,19,11,"Their border goes up to the west, to Maralah; it touches Dabbesheth, then the wadi that is opposite Jokneam."
Joshua,19,12,"It turns from Sarid to the east to the sunrise, to the border of Kislot-Tabor; it continues to Daberath and goes up to Japhia."
Joshua,19,13,"From there it passes along to the east toward the sunrise, to Gath Hepher and to Eth Kazin, and continuing to Rimmon, it turns to Neah;"

Joshua,20,1,"And Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying,"
Joshua,20,2,"“Speak to the Israelites, saying, ‘Appoint for yourselves cities of refuge, of which I spoke to you through the hand of Moses."
Joshua,20,3,Anyone who kills a person by accident or unintentionally may flee there; they will be for yourselves a refuge from the avenger of blood.
Joshua,20,4,"The killer will flee to one of these cities, stand at the entrance of the gate of the city, and state his case to the elders of that city; and they will take him into the city and give him a place, and he will dwell among them."
Joshua,20,5,"And if the avenger of blood pursues after him, they will not hand over the killer into his hand, because he killed his neighbor unintentionally, and he did not hate him previously."

Joshua,21,2,"And they spoke to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, “Yahweh commanded through the hand of Moses to give us cities to live in, with their pasturelands for our livestock.”"
Joshua,21,3,"So, by command of Yahweh, the Israelites gave the Levites these cities and their pasturelands from their inheritance."

Joshua,21,41,All the cities of the Levites among the property of the Israelites were forty-eight cities and their pasturelands.
Joshua,21,42,Each of these cities had pasturelands surrounding them; so it was for all of these cities.
Joshua,21,43,"And Yahweh gave to Israel all the land that he swore to give to their ancestors, and they took possession of it and settled in it."
Joshua,21,44,"Yahweh gave them rest on every side, according to all that he had sworn to their ancestors, and nobody from all their enemies withstood them, for Yahweh had given all their enemies into their hand."
Joshua,21,45,And nothing failed from all the good things that Yahweh promised to the house of Israel; everything came to pass.
Joshua,22,1,"Then Joshua summoned the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh,"
Joshua,22,2,"and he said to them, “You have observed all that Moses Yahweh’s servant commanded you, and you have listened to my voice in all that I have commanded you;"
Joshua,22,3,"you have not forsaken your kinsmen these many days, up to this day, and you have observed the obligation of the command of Yahweh your God."
Joshua,22,4,"So then, Yahweh your God has given rest to your kinsmen, just as he promised them; so then, turn and go to your tents to the land of your possession, which Moses Yahweh’s servant gave to you beyond the Jordan."
Joshua,22,5,"Only be very careful to observe the commandment and law that Moses Yahweh’s servant commanded you, to love Yahweh your God, to walk in all his ways, to keep his commandments, to hold fast to him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul.”"
Joshua,22,6,"And Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went to their tents."
Joshua,22,7,"And to the half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given a possession in Bashan, but to the other half Joshua had given a possession with their kinsmen beyond the Jordan to the west; and when Joshua sent them to their tents and blessed them,"
Joshua,22,8,"he said to them, “Return to your tents with much wealth, and with very much livestock, with silver, gold, copper, iron, and with very much clothing; divide the war-booty of your enemies with your kinsmen.”"
Joshua,22,9,"So the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned home and departed with the Israelites at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the land of Gilead to the land of their possession, which they had acquired according to the command of Yahweh through the hand of Moses."
Joshua,22,10,"And they came to the region of the Jordan that is in the land of Canaan, and the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an altar on the Jordan, a large and imposing altar."
Joshua,22,11,"And the Israelites heard it said that the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh had built an altar next to the land of Canaan, in the region of the Jordan, on the side belonging to the Israelites."
Joshua,22,12,"When the Israelites heard of it, the whole congregation of the Israelites gathered at Shiloh to go up against them for battle."
Joshua,22,13,"And the Israelites sent to the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, Phinehas the priest son of Eleazar,"
Joshua,22,14,"and ten leaders with him, one leader for each family from each of the tribes of Israel; and each one was the head of his family among the clans of Israel."
Joshua,22,15,"They came to the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them, saying,"
Joshua,22,16,"“Thus says all the congregation of Yahweh: ‘What is this treachery that you have committed against the God of Israel by turning away today from following Yahweh, by building for yourselves an altar to rebel today against Yahweh?"
Joshua,22,17,"Is not the sin of Peor enough for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves today, and for which a plague came to the congregation of Yahweh,"
Joshua,22,18,"that you must turn today from following Yahweh? If you rebel today against Yahweh, tomorrow he will be angry with all of the congregation of Israel;"
Joshua,22,19,"if, however, the land of your property is unclean, cross over to the land of Yahweh’s property, where Yahweh’s tabernacle resides, and take possession among us. But you must not rebel against Yahweh or against us by building for yourselves an altar other than the altar of Yahweh our God."
Joshua,22,20,"Did not Achan son of Zerah commit treachery with devoted things, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? And he alone did not perish because of his iniquity.’ ”"
Joshua,22,21,"And the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh spoke with the heads of the clans of Israel,"
Joshua,22,22,"“Yahweh, God of gods! Yahweh, God of gods knows. And let Israel itself know, if it was in rebellion or treachery against Yahweh, do not spare us this day"
Joshua,22,23,"for building for ourselves an altar to turn away from Yahweh, or if it was to offer burnt offerings, grain offerings, or fellowship offerings on it, may Yahweh himself take vengeance."
Joshua,22,24,"But in fact, we have done this because of anxiety, because of a reason, saying, ‘In the future your children may say to our children, ‘What is the relationship between you and Yahweh the God of Israel?"
Joshua,22,25,"Yahweh has made the Jordan a border between us and you, the descendants of Reuben and Gad; you have no portion in Yahweh.’ So your children may put an end to our children worshiping Yahweh."
Joshua,22,26,"So we said, ‘Let us build immediately for ourselves an altar, not for burnt offerings or for sacrifices;"
Joshua,22,27,"instead, it is a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us for performing the serving of Yahweh in his presence with our burnt offerings, sacrifices, and fellowship offerings; so that your children may not say in the future to our children, “You have no portion in Yahweh.” ’"
Joshua,22,28,"And we thought, if they say to us and to our children in the future, we can say, ‘Look at this replica of the altar of Yahweh, which our ancestors made, not for burnt offerings or sacrifices; rather, it is a witness between us and you.’"
Joshua,22,29,"Far be it from us to rebel against Yahweh, to turn today from following Yahweh, to build an altar for burnt offerings, grain offerings, or sacrifices, instead of the altar of Yahweh our God that is before his tabernacle.”"
Joshua,22,30,"Phinehas the priest, the leaders of the congregation, and the heads of the clans of Israel who were with him heard the words that the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh spoke, and they were satisfied."
Joshua,22,31,"Phinehas the priest, son of Eleazar, said to the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh, “Today we know that Yahweh is among us, because you have not committed this treachery against Yahweh. Therefore you have rescued the Israelites from the hand of Yahweh.”"
Joshua,22,32,"And Phinehas the priest, son of Eleazar, and the leaders returned from the descendants of Reuben and Gad, from the land of Gilead, to the land of Canaan to the Israelites, and they gave them their report."
Joshua,22,33,"The report satisfied the Israelites; they blessed God, and they did not speak of going up for battle against them to destroy the land in which the descendants of Reuben and Gad were living."
Joshua,22,34,"The descendants of Reuben and Gad called the altar Witness, “Because,” they said, “it is a witness between us that Yahweh is God.”"
Joshua,23,1,"And it happened, after a long time, after Yahweh had given rest to Israel from all their surrounding enemies, and after Joshua was old and well-advanced in years,"
Joshua,23,2,"Joshua summoned all Israel, their elders, heads, judges, and officials, and he said to them, “I am old and well-advanced in years,"
Joshua,23,3,"and you have seen all that Yahweh your God has done to all these nations for your sake, for Yahweh your God is fighting for you."
Joshua,23,4,"Look! I have allotted to you these remaining nations as an inheritance for your tribes, from the Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, to the Great Sea in the west."
Joshua,23,5,"And Yahweh your God will push them back before you and drive them out of your sight, and you will possess their land, just as Yahweh your God promised to you."
Joshua,23,6,"Be very strong to observe carefully all that is written in the scroll of the law of Moses so as not to turn aside from it, to the right or left,"
Joshua,23,7,"so as not to go among these remaining nations with you; do not profess the name of their gods, and do not swear by them, serve them, or bow down to them."
Joshua,23,8,"But hold fast to Yahweh your God, just as you have done up to this day."
Joshua,23,9,"Yahweh has driven out before you great and strong nations; and as for you, nobody has withstood you to this day."
Joshua,23,10,"One of your men put to flight a thousand, for Yahweh your God is fighting for you, just as he promised you."
Joshua,23,11,"Take utmost care for the sake of your life to love Yahweh your God,"
Joshua,23,12,"for if indeed you turn back and join these remaining nations among you, and you intermarry with them, marrying their women and they yours,"
Joshua,23,13,"know for certain that Yahweh your God will not continue to drive out these nations from before you; they will be for you a snare and a trap, a whip on your sides and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from this good land that Yahweh your God has given to you."
Joshua,23,14,"Look! I am about to die, and you know in all your hearts and souls that not one thing failed from all the good things that Yahweh your God promised concerning you; everything has been fulfilled; not one thing failed."
Joshua,23,15,"But just as all the good things came to you that Yahweh your God promised, so will Yahweh bring to you all the bad things until he has destroyed you from this good land that Yahweh your God has given to you."
Joshua,23,16,"If you transgress the covenant of Yahweh your God, which he commanded to you, and you go and serve other gods and bow down to them, Yahweh’s anger will be kindled against you, and you will perish quickly from the good land that he has given to you.”"
Joshua,24,1,"And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem; he summoned the elders of Israel, their heads, their judges, and their officials, and they presented themselves before God."
Joshua,24,2,"And Joshua said to all the people, “Thus says Yahweh the God of Israel: ‘Long ago your ancestors —Terah the father of Abraham and the father of Nahor—lived beyond the river, and they served other gods."
Joshua,24,3,"I took your ancestor Abraham from beyond the river and led him through all the land of Canaan, and I increased his offspring; I gave him Isaac,"
Joshua,24,4,"and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. To Esau I gave the hill country of Seir to possess, but Jacob and his children went down to Egypt."
Joshua,24,5,"And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt with what I did in its midst; and afterward I brought you out."
Joshua,24,6,"When I brought out your ancestors from Egypt, you came to the sea, and the Egyptians pursued after your ancestors with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea."
Joshua,24,7,"They cried out to Yahweh, and he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and he brought the sea over them and covered them; your own eyes saw what I did in Egypt. Then you lived in the wilderness for many days."
Joshua,24,8,"And I brought you to the land of the Amorites who lived beyond the Jordan; they fought you, and I gave them into your hand; you took possession of their land, and I destroyed them before you."
Joshua,24,9,"Then Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, set out and fought against Israel, and he sent and summoned Balaam son of Beor to curse you,"
Joshua,24,10,"but I was not willing to listen to Balaam, and he richly blessed you. So I rescued you from his hand,"
Joshua,24,11,"and you crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho. And the citizens of Jericho, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, fought against you, and I gave them into your hand."
Joshua,24,12,I sent before you the hornet and they drove out before you two kings of the Amorites; but not by your sword or bow.
Joshua,24,13,"I gave to you a land that you have not labored on, and cities that you have not built, and you live in them; you eat from vineyards and olive groves that you have not planted.’"
Joshua,24,14,"“So now, revere Yahweh and serve him in sincerity and faithfulness; remove the gods that your ancestors served beyond the river and in Egypt, and serve Yahweh."
Joshua,24,15,"But if it is bad in your eyes to serve Yahweh, choose for yourselves today whom you want to serve, whether it is the gods that your ancestors served beyond the river, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living; but as for me and my household, we will serve Yahweh.”"
Joshua,24,16,"And the people answered and said, “Far be it from us that we would forsake Yahweh to serve other gods,"
Joshua,24,17,"for Yahweh our God brought us and our ancestors from the land of Egypt, from the house of slavery, and did these great signs before our eyes. He protected us along the entire way that we went, and among all the peoples through whose midst we passed."
Joshua,24,18,"And Yahweh drove out all the people before us, the Amorites who live in the land. We will serve Yahweh, for he is our God.”"
Joshua,24,19,"But Joshua said to the people, “You cannot serve Yahweh, for he is a holy and jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions or your sins."
Joshua,24,20,"If you forsake Yahweh and serve foreign gods, he will turn and bring disaster to you; he will destroy you after he has done good to you.”"
Joshua,24,21,"And the people said to Joshua, “No, we will serve Yahweh.”"
Joshua,24,22,"And Joshua said to the people, “You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen for yourselves to serve Yahweh.” And they said, “We are witnesses.”"
Joshua,24,23,"He said, “Remove the foreign gods that are in your midst, and incline your hearts to Yahweh the God of Israel.”"
Joshua,24,24,"And the people said to Joshua, “We will serve Yahweh our God, and we will listen to his voice.”"
Joshua,24,25,"So Joshua made a covenant with the people on that day, and he established for them a statute and a judgment at Shechem."
Joshua,24,26,"Then Joshua wrote these words in a scroll of the law of God, and he took a large stone and set it up there under a large tree, which is at the shrine of Yahweh."
Joshua,24,27,"And Joshua said to all the people, “Look, this stone will be a witness against us, for it has heard all the words of Yahweh that he spoke with us. It will be as a witness against you, so that you do not deny your God.”"
Joshua,24,28,Then Joshua sent the people away to their inheritance.
Joshua,24,29,After these things Joshua son of Nun servant of Yahweh died; he was one hundred and ten years old.
Joshua,24,30,"They buried him in the territory of his inheritance, at Timnath-Serah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash."
Joshua,24,31,"Israel served Yahweh all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who lived long after Joshua, and who had known all the work that Yahweh did for Israel."
Joshua,24,32,"The bones of Jacob, which the Israelites had brought out from Egypt, they buried at Shechem, in a piece of land that Jacob had bought from the children of Hamor, the father of Shechem, for one hundred pieces of money; it became an inheritance for the descendants of Joseph."
Joshua,24,33,"And Eleazar son of Aaron died; and they buried him in Gibeah in the hill country of Ephraim, which had been given to his son Phinehas."
