Exodus,1,1,"And these are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt; with Jacob, they each came with his family:"
Exodus,1,2,"Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah;"
Exodus,1,3,"Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin;"
Exodus,1,4,"Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher."
Exodus,1,5,"And all those who descended from Jacob were seventy individuals, and Joseph was in Egypt."
Exodus,1,6,And Joseph died and all of his brothers and all of that generation.
Exodus,1,7,"And the Israelites were fruitful and multiplied and were many and were very, very numerous, and the land was filled with them."
Exodus,1,8,And a new king rose over Egypt who did not know Joseph.
Exodus,1,9,"And he said to his people, “Look, the people of the Israelites are greater and more numerous than us."
Exodus,1,10,"Come, we must deal shrewdly with them, lest they become many, and when war happens, they also will join our enemies and will fight against us and go up from the land.”"
Exodus,1,11,"And they appointed commanders of forced labor over them in order to oppress them with their forced labor, and they built storage cities for Pharaoh—Pithom and Rameses."
Exodus,1,12,"And as he oppressed them, so they became many, and so they spread out, and the Egyptians were afraid because of the presence of the Israelites."
Exodus,1,13,And the Egyptians ruthlessly compelled the Israelites to work.
Exodus,1,14,And they made their lives bitter with hard work with mortar and with bricks and with all sorts of work in the field—with all their work in which they ruthlessly enslaved them.
Exodus,1,15,And the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives—of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah and the name of the second was Puah—
Exodus,1,16,"and he said, “When you help the Hebrews give birth, you will look upon the pairs of testicles; if he is a son, you will put him to death, and if she is a daughter, she will live.”"
Exodus,1,17,"But the midwives feared God, and they did not do as the king of Egypt had said to them. They let the boys live."
Exodus,1,18,"And the king of Egypt summoned the midwives, and he said to them, “Why have you done this thing and let the boys live?”"
Exodus,1,19,"And the midwives said to Pharaoh, “Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women, because they are vigorous; before the midwife comes to them, they have given birth.”"
Exodus,1,20,"And God did the midwives good, and the Israelite people became many and were very numerous."
Exodus,1,21,"And so because the midwives feared God, he gave them families."
Exodus,1,22,"And Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, “Every son who is born you will throw into the Nile, and every daughter you will let live.”"
Exodus,2,1,"And a man from the family of Levi went, and he took a descendent of Levi."
Exodus,2,2,"And the woman conceived, and she gave birth to a son, and she saw him, that he was a fine baby, and she hid him three months."
Exodus,2,3,"But when she could no longer hide him, she got a papyrus basket for him, and she coated it with tar and with pitch, and she placed the boy in it, and she placed it among the reeds on the bank of the Nile."
Exodus,2,4,And his sister stood at a distance to know what would be done to him.
Exodus,2,5,"And the daughter of Pharaoh went down to wash at the Nile, while her maidservants were walking alongside the Nile, and she saw the basket in the midst of the reeds, and she sent her slave woman for it and took it"
Exodus,2,6,"and opened it and saw him—the boy—and it was a lad weeping, and she had compassion for him and said, “This must be from the boys of the Hebrews.”"
Exodus,2,7,"And his sister said to the daughter of Pharaoh, “Shall I go and call for you a woman from the Hebrews who is nursing so that she will nurse the boy for you?”"
Exodus,2,8,"And the daughter of Pharaoh said to her, “Go.” And the girl went, and she called the mother of the boy."
Exodus,2,9,"And the daughter of Pharaoh said, “Take this boy and nurse him for me, and I myself will give you wages, and the woman took the boy, and she nursed him."
Exodus,2,10,"And the boy grew, and she brought him to the daughter of Pharaoh, and he became her son, and she called his name Moses, and she said, “Because I drew him out from the water.”"
Exodus,2,11,"And then in those days when Moses had grown up, he went out to his brothers, and he saw their forced labor, and he saw an Egyptian man striking a Hebrew man, one of his brothers."
Exodus,2,12,"And he turned here and there, and he saw no one, and he struck the Egyptian, and he hid him in the sand."
Exodus,2,13,"And he went out on the second day, and there were two Hebrew men fighting, and he said to the guilty one, “Why do you strike your neighbor?”"
Exodus,2,14,"And he said, “Who appointed you as a commander and a judge over us? Are you intending to kill me like you killed the Egyptian?” And Moses was afraid, and he said, “Surely the matter has become known.”"
Exodus,2,15,"And Pharaoh heard this matter, and he sought to kill Moses, and Moses fled from Pharaoh, and he lived in the land of Midian, and he lived at a certain well."
Exodus,2,16,"Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came and drew water and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock."
Exodus,2,17,"And the shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses stood up and came to their rescue and watered their flock."
Exodus,2,18,"And they came to Reuel, their father, and he said, “Why have you come so quickly today?”"
Exodus,2,19,"And they said, “An Egyptian man delivered us from the hand of the shepherds, and he even drew water for us and watered the flock.”"
Exodus,2,20,"And he said to his daughters, “Where is he? Why then have you left the man? Call him so that he can eat some food.”"
Exodus,2,21,"And Moses agreed to stay with the man, and he gave Zipporah his daughter to Moses."
Exodus,2,22,"And she bore a son, and he called his name Gershom because he said, “I am an alien in a foreign land.”"
Exodus,2,23,"And then during those many days, the king of Egypt died, and the Israelites groaned because of the work, and they cried out, and their cry for help because of the work went up to God."
Exodus,2,24,"And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob,"
Exodus,2,25,"and God saw the Israelites, and God took notice."
Exodus,3,1,"And Moses was a shepherd with the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the west of the desert, and he came to the mountain of God, to Horeb."
Exodus,3,2,"And the angel of Yahweh appeared to him in a flame of fire from the midst of a bush, and he looked, and there was the bush burning with fire, but the bush was not being consumed."
Exodus,3,3,"And Moses said, “Let me turn aside and see this great sight. Why does the bush not burn up?”"
Exodus,3,4,"And Yahweh saw that he turned aside to see, and God called to him from the midst of the bush, and he said, “Moses, Moses.” And he said, “Here I am.”"
Exodus,3,5,"And he said, “You must not come near to here. Take off your sandals from on your feet, because the place on which you are standing, it is holy ground.”"
Exodus,3,6,"And he said, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” And Moses hid his face because he was afraid of looking at God."
Exodus,3,7,"And Yahweh said, “Surely I have seen the misery of my people who are in Egypt, and I have heard their cry of distress because of their oppressors, for I know their sufferings."
Exodus,3,8,"And I have come down to deliver them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up from this land to a good and wide land, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites."
Exodus,3,9,"And now, look, the cry of distress of the Israelites has come to me, and also I see the oppression with which the Egyptians are oppressing them."
Exodus,3,10,"And now come, and I will send you to Pharaoh, and you must bring my people, the Israelites, out from Egypt.”"
Exodus,3,11,"But Moses said to God, “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and that I should bring the Israelites out from Egypt?”"
Exodus,3,12,"And he said, “Because I am with you, and this will be the sign for you that I myself have sent you: When you bring the people out from Egypt, you will serve God on this mountain.”"
Exodus,3,13,"But Moses said to God, “Look, if I go to the Israelites and I say to them, ‘The God of your ancestors has sent me to you,’ and they say to me, ‘What is his name?’ then what shall I say to them?”"
Exodus,3,14,"And God said to Moses, “I am that I am.” And he said, “So you must say to the Israelites, ‘I am sent me to you.’ ”"
Exodus,3,15,"And God said again to Moses, “So you must say to the Israelites, ‘Yahweh, the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you. This is my name forever, and this is my remembrance from generation to generation.’"
Exodus,3,16,"Go and gather the elders of Israel and say to them, ‘Yahweh, the God of your ancestors, appeared to me, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, “I have carefully attended to you and what has been done to you in Egypt.”"
Exodus,3,17,"And I said, “I will bring you up from the misery of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.” ’"
Exodus,3,18,"And they will listen to your voice, and you will go, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and you will say to him, ‘Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews has met with us, and now let us please go on a journey of three days into the desert, and let us sacrifice to Yahweh our God.’"
Exodus,3,19,But I myself know that the king of Egypt will not allow you to go unless compelled by a strong hand.
Exodus,3,20,"And I will stretch out my hand, and I will strike Egypt with all of my wonders that I will do in its midst, and afterward he will release you."
Exodus,3,21,"And I will give this people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians, and then when you go, you will not go empty-handed."
Exodus,3,22,"And a woman will ask from her neighbor and from the woman dwelling as an alien in her house for objects of silver and objects of gold and garments, and you will put them on your sons and on your daughters; and you will plunder Egypt.”"
Exodus,4,1,"And Moses answered, and he said, “And if they do not believe me and they do not listen to my voice, but they say, ‘Yahweh did not appear to you?’ ”"
Exodus,4,2,"And Yahweh said to him, “What is this in your hand?” And he said, “A staff.”"
Exodus,4,3,"And he said, “Throw it onto the ground.” And he threw it onto the ground, and it became a snake, and Moses fled from it."
Exodus,4,4,"And Yahweh said to Moses, “Reach out your hand and grasp it by its tail”—” (And he reached out his hand and grabbed it, and it became a staff in his palm.)—"
Exodus,4,5,"“so that they may believe that Yahweh, the God of their ancestors, appeared to you, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.”"
Exodus,4,6,"And Yahweh said to him again, “Put your hand into the fold of your garment.” And he put his hand into the fold of his garment, and he took it out, and, to his surprise, his hand was afflicted with a skin disease, like snow."
Exodus,4,7,"And he said, “Return your hand to the fold of your garment.” And he returned his hand to the fold of his garment, and he took it out from the fold of his garment, and, to his surprise, it was restored like the rest of his body."
Exodus,4,8,"“And if they do not believe you and they will not listen to the voice of the former sign, then they will believe the voice of the latter sign."
Exodus,4,9,"And if they also do not believe the second of these signs and they will not listen to your voice, then you must take water from the Nile and pour it onto the dry ground, and the water that you take from the Nile will become blood on the dry ground.”"
Exodus,4,10,"And Moses said to Yahweh, “Please, Lord, I am not a man of words, neither recently nor in the past nor since your speaking to your servant, because I am heavy of mouth and of tongue.”"
Exodus,4,11,"And Yahweh said to him, “Who gave a mouth to humankind, or who makes mute or deaf or sighted or blind? Is it not I, Yahweh?"
Exodus,4,12,"So then go, and I myself will be with your mouth, and I will teach you what you must speak.”"
Exodus,4,13,"And he said, “Please, Lord, do send anyone else whom you wish to send.”"
Exodus,4,14,"And Yahweh was angry with Moses and said, “Is there not Aaron your brother the Levite? I know that he certainly can speak, and also there he is coming out to meet you, and when he sees you, he will rejoice in his heart."
Exodus,4,15,"And you will speak to him, and you will put words in his mouth, and I myself will be with your mouth and with his mouth, and I will teach you what you must do."
Exodus,4,16,"And he will speak for you to the people, and then he will be to you as a mouth, and you will be to him as a god."
Exodus,4,17,"And you must take this staff in your hand, with which you will do the signs.”"
Exodus,4,18,"And Moses went, and he returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and he said to him, “Please let me go, and let me return to my brothers who are in Egypt, and let me see whether they are yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, “Go in peace.”"
Exodus,4,19,"And Yahweh said to Moses in Midian, “Go, return to Egypt because all the men have died who were seeking your life.”"
Exodus,4,20,"And Moses took his wife and his sons and had them ride on the donkey, and he returned to the land of Egypt, and Moses took the staff of God in his hand."
Exodus,4,21,"And Yahweh said to Moses, “When you go to return to Egypt, see all of the wonders that I have put in your hand, and do them before Pharaoh, and I myself will harden his heart, and he will not release the people."
Exodus,4,22,"And you must say to Pharaoh, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “Israel is my son, my firstborn.”"
Exodus,4,23,"And I said to you, “Release my son and let him serve me,” but you refused to release him. Look, I am about to kill your son, your firstborn.’ ”"
Exodus,4,24,"And on the way, at the place of overnight lodging, Yahweh encountered him and sought to kill him."
Exodus,4,25,"But Zipporah took a flint knife, and she cut off the foreskin of her son, and she touched his feet, and she said, “Yes, you are a bridegroom of blood to me.”"
Exodus,4,26,"And he left him alone. At that time she said, “A bridegroom of blood,” because of the circumcision."
Exodus,4,27,"And Yahweh said to Aaron, “Go to the desert to meet Moses.” And he went and encountered him at the mountain of God and kissed him."
Exodus,4,28,"And Moses told Aaron all the words of Yahweh, who had sent him—and all the signs that he had commanded him."
Exodus,4,29,"And Moses and Aaron went, and they gathered all of the elders of the Israelites."
Exodus,4,30,"And Aaron spoke all the words that Yahweh had spoken to Moses, and he did the signs before the eyes of the people."
Exodus,4,31,"And the people believed when they heard that Yahweh had attended to the Israelites and that he had seen their misery, and they knelt down and they worshiped."
Exodus,5,1,"And afterward, Moses and Aaron went, and they said to Pharaoh, “Thus says Yahweh the God of Israel, ‘Release my people so that they may hold a festival for me in the desert.’ ”"
Exodus,5,2,"And Pharaoh said, “Who is Yahweh that I should listen to his voice to release Israel? I do not know Yahweh, and also I will not release Israel.”"
Exodus,5,3,"And they said, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us go on a three-day journey into the desert, and let us sacrifice to Yahweh our God, lest he strike us with plague or with sword.”"
Exodus,5,4,"And the king of Egypt said, “Why, Moses and Aaron, do you take the people from their work? Go to your forced labor!”"
Exodus,5,5,"And Pharaoh said, “Look, the people of the land are now many, and you want to stop them from their forced labor.”"
Exodus,5,6,"And on that day Pharaoh commanded the slave drivers over the people and his foremen, saying,"
Exodus,5,7,“You must no longer give straw to the people to make the bricks like before. Let them go and gather straw for themselves.
Exodus,5,8,"But the quota of the bricks that they were making before you must require of them. You must not reduce from it, because they are lazy. Therefore they are crying out, saying, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to our God.’"
Exodus,5,9,Let the work be heavier on the men so that they will do it and not pay attention to words of deception.”
Exodus,5,10,"And the slave drivers of the people and their foremen went out, and they spoke to the people, saying, “Thus says Pharaoh, ‘I am not giving you straw."
Exodus,5,11,"You go, get straw for yourselves from whatever you find because not a thing is being reduced from your work.’ ”"
Exodus,5,12,And the people spread out in all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for the straw.
Exodus,5,13,"And the slave drivers were insisting, saying, “Finish your work for each day on its day, as when there was straw.”"
Exodus,5,14,"And the foremen of the Israelites, whom Pharaoh’s slave drivers had appointed over them, were beaten by men who were saying, “Why have you not completed your portion of brickmaking as before, both yesterday and today?”"
Exodus,5,15,"And the foremen of the Israelites came and cried out to Pharaoh, saying, “Why do you treat your servants like this?"
Exodus,5,16,"Straw is not being given to your servants, but they are saying to us, ‘Make bricks!’ and, look, your servants are being beaten, but it is the fault of your people.”"
Exodus,5,17,"And he said, “You are lazy, lazy! Therefore you are saying, ‘Let us go; let us sacrifice to Yahweh.’"
Exodus,5,18,"And now go, work, but straw will not be given to you, and you must give the full quota of bricks.”"
Exodus,5,19,"And the foremen of the Israelites saw they were in trouble with the saying, “You will not reduce from your bricks for each day on its day.”"
Exodus,5,20,"And they met Moses and Aaron, who were waiting to meet them when they were going out from Pharaoh."
Exodus,5,21,"And they said to them, “May Yahweh look upon you and judge because you have caused our fragrance to stink in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants so as to put a sword into their hand to kill us.”"
Exodus,5,22,"And Moses returned to Yahweh and said, “Lord, why have you brought trouble to this people? Why ever did you send me?"
Exodus,5,23,"And from the time I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble to this people, and you have certainly not delivered your people.”"
Exodus,6,1,"And Yahweh said to Moses, “Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh, because with a strong hand he will release them, and with a strong hand he will drive them out from his land.”"
Exodus,6,2,"And God spoke to Moses, and he said to him, “I am Yahweh."
Exodus,6,3,"And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as God Shaddai, but by my name Yahweh I was not known to them."
Exodus,6,4,"And I not only established my covenant with them to give to them the land of Canaan, the land of their sojournings, in which they dwelt as aliens,"
Exodus,6,5,"but also I myself heard the groaning of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians are making to work, and I remembered my covenant."
Exodus,6,6,"Therefore say to the Israelites, ‘I am Yahweh, and I will bring you out from under the forced labor of Egypt, and I will deliver you from their slavery, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great punishments."
Exodus,6,7,"And I will take you as my people, and I will be your God, and you will know that I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out from under the forced labor of Egypt."
Exodus,6,8,"And I will bring you to the land that I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, and I will give it to you as a possession. I am Yahweh.”"
Exodus,6,9,"And Moses spoke thus to the Israelites, but they did not listen to Moses, because of discouragement and because of hard work."
Exodus,6,10,"And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,"
Exodus,6,11,"“Go, speak to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and let him release the Israelites from his land.”"
Exodus,6,12,"And Moses spoke before Yahweh, saying, “Look, the Israelites do not listen to me, and how will Pharaoh listen to me, since I am a poor speaker?”"
Exodus,6,13,"And Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, and he commanded them to go to the Israelites and to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, to bring the Israelites out from the land of Egypt."
Exodus,6,14,"These are the heads of their families. The sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel, are Enoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi. These are the clans of Reuben."
Exodus,6,15,And the sons of Simeon are Jemuel and Jamin and Ohad and Jakin and Zohar and Shaul the son of the Canaanitess. These are the clans of Simeon.
Exodus,6,16,"And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their genealogies: Gershon and Kohath and Merari, and the years of the life of Levi were one hundred and thirty-seven years."
Exodus,6,17,The sons of Gershon are Libni and Shimei according to their clans.
Exodus,6,18,"And the sons of Kohath are Amram and Izhar and Hebron and Uzziel, and the years of the life of Kohath were one hundred and thirty-three years."
Exodus,6,19,And the sons of Merari are Mahli and Mushi. These are clans of the Levites according to their genealogies.
Exodus,6,20,"And Amram took Jochebed his aunt for himself as a wife, and she bore for him Aaron and Moses, and the years of the life of Amram were one hundred and thirty-seven years."
Exodus,6,21,And the sons of Izhar are Korah and Nepheg and Zikri.
Exodus,6,22,And the sons of Uzziel are Mishael and Elzaphan and Sithri.
Exodus,6,23,"And Aaron took Elisheba the daughter of Amminadab, the sister of Nahshon, for himself as a wife, and she bore for him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar."
Exodus,6,24,And the sons of Korah are Assir and Elkanah and Abiasaph. These are the clans of the Korahites.
Exodus,6,25,"And Eleazar the son of Aaron took for himself one from the daughters of Putiel as a wife, and she bore for him Phinehas. These are the heads of the families of the Levites according to their clans."
Exodus,6,26,"It was that Aaron and Moses to whom Yahweh said, “Bring the Israelites out from the land of Egypt according to their divisions.”"
Exodus,6,27,"They were those who spoke to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, in order to bring the Israelites out from Egypt. It was that Moses and Aaron."
Exodus,6,28,And so it was on a certain day Yahweh spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt.
Exodus,6,29,"And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, “I am Yahweh. Speak to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, all that I am speaking to you.”"
Exodus,6,30,"And Moses said before Yahweh, “Look, I am a poor speaker. And how will Pharaoh listen to me?”"
Exodus,7,1,"And Yahweh said to Moses, “See, I have made you as a god to Pharaoh, and Aaron your brother will be your prophet."
Exodus,7,2,"You will speak all that I will command you, and Aaron your brother will speak to Pharaoh, and he will release the Israelites from his land."
Exodus,7,3,"And I myself will harden the heart of Pharaoh, and I will make my signs and my wonders numerous in the land of Egypt."
Exodus,7,4,"And Pharaoh will not listen to you, and I will put my hand into Egypt and bring out my divisions, my people, the Israelites, from the land of Egypt with great punishments."
Exodus,7,5,And the Egyptians will know that I am Yahweh when I stretch out my hand over Egypt and bring the Israelites out from their midst.”
Exodus,7,6,"And Moses and Aaron did it; as Yahweh commanded them, so they did."
Exodus,7,7,"(And Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron was eighty-three years old when they spoke to Pharaoh.)"
Exodus,7,8,"And Yahweh said to Moses and to Aaron, saying,"
Exodus,7,9,"“When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, ‘Do a wonder for yourselves,’ you will say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and throw it before Pharaoh, and it will become a snake.’ ”"
Exodus,7,10,"And Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh, and they did so, as Yahweh had commanded. And Aaron threw his staff before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a snake."
Exodus,7,11,"And Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers, and they also, the magicians of Egypt, did likewise with their secret arts."
Exodus,7,12,"Each threw down his staff, and they became snakes, and Aaron’s staff swallowed up their staffs."
Exodus,7,13,"And Pharaoh’s heart was hard, and he did not listen to them, as Yahweh had said."
Exodus,7,14,"And Yahweh said to Moses, “Pharaoh’s heart is insensitive; he refuses to release the people."
Exodus,7,15,"Go to Pharaoh in the morning. Look, he is going out to the water, and you must wait to meet him on the bank of the Nile, and you must take in your hand the staff that was changed into a snake."
Exodus,7,16,"And you must say to him, ‘Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to you, saying, “Release my people that they may serve me in the desert, and, look, you have not listened until now.”"
Exodus,7,17,"Thus says Yahweh, “By this you will know that I am Yahweh. Look, I am about to strike with the staff that is in my hand the water that is in the Nile, and it will be changed to blood."
Exodus,7,18,"And the fish that are in the Nile will die, and the Nile will stink, and the Egyptians will be unable to drink water from the Nile.” ’ ”"
Exodus,7,19,"And Yahweh said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and stretch your hand out over the waters of Egypt and over their rivers, over their canals, and over their pools and over all of their reservoirs of water, so that they become blood,’ and blood will be in all the land of Egypt and in vessels of wood and of stone.”"
Exodus,7,20,"And Moses and Aaron did so, as Yahweh had commanded, and he raised the staff and struck the water that was in the Nile before the eyes of Pharaoh and before the eyes of his servants, and all of the water that was in the Nile was changed to blood."
Exodus,7,21,"And the fish that were in the Nile died, and the Nile stank, and the Egyptians were not able to drink water from the Nile, and the blood was in all the land of Egypt."
Exodus,7,22,"And the magicians of Egypt did likewise with their secret arts, and Pharaoh’s heart was hard, and he did not listen to them, as Yahweh had spoken."
Exodus,7,23,"And Pharaoh turned and went to his house, and he did not take also this to heart."
Exodus,7,24,"And all of the Egyptians dug around the Nile for water to drink, because they were unable to drink from the water of the Nile."
Exodus,7,25,And seven days passed after Yahweh struck the Nile.
Exodus,8,1,"And Yahweh said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh, and say to him, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “Release my people so that they may serve me.”"
Exodus,8,2,"And if you are refusing to release, look, I am going to plague all of your territory with frogs."
Exodus,8,3,"And the Nile will swarm with frogs, and they will go up and come into your house and into your bedroom and onto your bed and into the house of your servants and among your people and into your ovens and into your kneading troughs."
Exodus,8,4,And the frogs will go up against you and against your people and against all of your servants.’ ”
Exodus,8,5,"And Yahweh said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Stretch out your hand with your staff over the rivers, over the canals, and over the pools, and bring up the frogs on the land of Egypt.’ ”"
Exodus,8,6,"And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs went up and covered the land of Egypt."
Exodus,8,7,"And the magicians did likewise with their secret arts, and they brought up frogs over the land of Egypt."
Exodus,8,8,"And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron and said, “Pray to Yahweh, and let him remove the frogs from me and from my people, and let me release the people so that they can sacrifice to Yahweh.”"
Exodus,8,9,"And Moses said to Pharaoh, “I leave to you the honor over me. When shall I pray for you and for your servants and for your people to cut off the frogs from you and from your houses? They will be left only in the Nile.”"
Exodus,8,10,"And he said, “Tomorrow.” And he said, “Let it be according to your word so that you will know that there is no one like Yahweh our God."
Exodus,8,11,And the frogs will depart from you and from your house and from your servants. They will be left only in the Nile.”
Exodus,8,12,"And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and Moses cried out to Yahweh over the matter of the frogs that he had brought on Pharaoh."
Exodus,8,13,"And Yahweh did according to the word of Moses, and the frogs died from the houses, from the courtyards, and from the fields."
Exodus,8,14,"And they piled them in countless heaps, and the land stank."
Exodus,8,15,"And Pharaoh saw that there was relief, and he made his heart insensitive, and he did not listen to them, as Yahweh had spoken."
Exodus,8,16,"And Yahweh said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the land, and it will become gnats in all the land of Egypt.’ ”"
Exodus,8,17,"And he did so, and Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff, and he struck the dust of the land, and it became gnats on the humans and on the animals; all of the dust of the land became gnats in all the land of Egypt."
Exodus,8,18,"And the magicians did so with their secret arts to bring out the gnats, but they were not able, and the gnats were on the humans and on the animals."
Exodus,8,19,"And the magicians said to Pharaoh, “It is the finger of God.” But the heart of Pharaoh was hard, and he did not listen to them, as Yahweh had spoken."
Exodus,8,20,"And Yahweh said to Moses, “Start early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh. Look, he is going out to the water, and you must say to him, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “Release my people so that they may serve me.”"
Exodus,8,21,"But if you are not about to release my people, look, I am about to send out flies among you and among your servants and among your people and in your houses; and the houses of Egypt will fill up with the flies and also the ground that they are on."
Exodus,8,22,"But on that day I will distinguish the land of Goshen, where my people are staying, by there not being flies there, so that you will know that I am Yahweh in the midst of the land."
Exodus,8,23,And I will put a distinction between my people and your people; this sign will be tomorrow.’ ”
Exodus,8,24,"And Yahweh did so, and a severe swarm of flies came to the house of Pharaoh and the house of his servants and in all the land of Egypt; the land was ruined because of the flies."
Exodus,8,25,"And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron, and he said, “Go, sacrifice to your God in the land.”"
Exodus,8,26,"And Moses said, “To do so is not right, because we will sacrifice to Yahweh our God a thing detestable to the Egyptians. Look, if we sacrifice before their eyes the thing detestable to the Egyptians, will they not stone us?"
Exodus,8,27,"We will go a journey of three days into the desert, and we will sacrifice to Yahweh our God according to what he says to us.”"
Exodus,8,28,"And Pharaoh said, “I myself will release you, and you will sacrifice to Yahweh your God in the desert. Only surely you must not go far. Pray for me.”"
Exodus,8,29,"And Moses said, “Look, I am going out from you, and I will pray to Yahweh so that the flies depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people tomorrow. Only let not Pharaoh again deceive us by not releasing the people to sacrifice to Yahweh.”"
Exodus,8,30,And Moses went out from Pharaoh and prayed to Yahweh.
Exodus,8,31,"And Yahweh did according to the word of Moses and removed the flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; not one was left."
Exodus,8,32,"And Pharaoh made his heart insensitive also this time, and he did not release the people."
Exodus,9,1,"And Yahweh said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘Thus says Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, “Release my people so that they may serve me.”"
Exodus,9,2,"But if you are refusing to release and you still are keeping hold of them,"
Exodus,9,3,"look, the hand of Yahweh is about to be present with a very severe plague on your livestock that are in the field, on the horses, on the donkeys, on the camels, on the cattle, and on the sheep and goats."
Exodus,9,4,"But Yahweh will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt, and not a thing will die from all that belongs to the Israelites.’ ”"
Exodus,9,5,"And Yahweh set an appointed time, saying, “Tomorrow Yahweh will do this thing in the land.”"
Exodus,9,6,"And Yahweh did this thing the next day; all the livestock of Egypt died, but from the livestock of the Israelites not one died."
Exodus,9,7,"And Pharaoh sent to check, and it turned out not even one from the livestock of Israel had died, but Pharaoh’s heart was insensitive, and he did not release the people."
Exodus,9,8,"And Yahweh said to Moses and to Aaron, “Take for yourselves full handfuls of soot from a smelting furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heavens before the eyes of Pharaoh."
Exodus,9,9,"And it will become fine dust over all the land of Egypt, and it will become on humans and on animals a skin sore sprouting blisters in all the land of Egypt.”"
Exodus,9,10,"And they took the soot of the smelting furnace, and they stood before Pharaoh, and Moses sprinkled it toward the heavens, and it became skin sores sprouting blisters on humans and on animals."
Exodus,9,11,"And the magicians were not able to stand before Moses because of the skin sores, for the skin sores were on the magicians and on all the Egyptians."
Exodus,9,12,"And Yahweh hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not listen to them, as Yahweh had spoken to Moses."
Exodus,9,13,"And Yahweh said to Moses, “Start early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh. Look, he is going out to the water, and you must say to him, ‘Thus says Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, “Release my people so that they may serve me."
Exodus,9,14,For at this time I am sending all of my plagues to you personally and among your servants and among your people so that you will know that there is no one like me in all the earth.
Exodus,9,15,"For now I could have stretched out my hand, and I could have struck you and your people with the plague, and you would have perished from the earth."
Exodus,9,16,But for the sake of this I have caused you to stand—for the sake of showing you my strength and in order to proclaim my name in all the earth.
Exodus,9,17,Still you are behaving haughtily to my people by not releasing them.
Exodus,9,18,"Look, about this time tomorrow, I am going to cause very severe hail to rain, the like of which has not been in Egypt from the day it was founded until now."
Exodus,9,19,"And now send word; bring into safety your livestock and all that belongs to you in the field. The hail will come down on every human and animal that is found in the field and not gathered into the house, and they will die.” ’ ”"
Exodus,9,20,Anyone from the servants of Pharaoh who feared the word of Yahweh caused his servants and livestock to flee to the houses.
Exodus,9,21,But whoever did not give regard to the word of Yahweh abandoned his servants and his livestock in the field.
Exodus,9,22,"And Yahweh said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand to the heavens, and let there be hail in all the land of Egypt, on human and on animal and on all the vegetation of the field in the land of Egypt.”"
Exodus,9,23,"And Moses stretched out his staff to the heavens, and Yahweh gave thunder and hail, and fire went to the earth, and Yahweh caused hail to rain on the land of Egypt."
Exodus,9,24,"And there was hail, and fire was flashing back and forth in the midst of the very severe hail, the like of which was not in all the land of Egypt since it had become a nation."
Exodus,9,25,"And the hail struck in all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, from human to animal, and the hail struck all the vegetation of the field and smashed every tree of the field."
Exodus,9,26,"Only in the land of Goshen, where the Israelites were, there was no hail."
Exodus,9,27,"And Pharaoh sent and called Moses and Aaron and said to them, “I have sinned this time. Yahweh is the righteous one, and I and my people are the wicked ones."
Exodus,9,28,"Pray to Yahweh. The thunder of God and hail are enough, and I will release you, and you will no longer have to stay.”"
Exodus,9,29,"And Moses said to him, “At my leaving the city, I will spread out my hands to Yahweh. The thunder will stop, and the hail will be no more, so that you will know that the earth belongs to Yahweh."
Exodus,9,30,"But as for you and your servants, I know that you do not yet fear the presence of Yahweh God.”"
Exodus,9,31,"And the flax and the barley were struck, because the barley was in the ear and the flax was in bud."
Exodus,9,32,"But the wheat and the spelt were not struck, because they are late-ripening."
Exodus,9,33,"And Moses went from Pharaoh out of the city, and he spread his hands to Yahweh, and the thunder and the hail stopped, and rain did not pour on the earth."
Exodus,9,34,"And Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder stopped, and he again sinned and made his heart insensitive, he and his servants."
Exodus,9,35,"And Pharaoh’s heart was hard, and he did not release the Israelites, as Yahweh had said by the agency of Moses."
Exodus,10,1,"And Yahweh said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh, for I have made his heart insensitive and the heart of his servants in order to put these signs of mine in his midst,"
Exodus,10,2,"so that you will tell in the ears of your child and your grandchild that I dealt harshly with the Egyptians and so that you will tell about my signs that I have done among them, and so you will know that I am Yahweh.”"
Exodus,10,3,"And Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh, and they said to him, “Thus says Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, ‘Until when will you refuse to submit before me? Release my people so that they may serve me."
Exodus,10,4,"But if you are refusing to release my people, look, I am about to bring locusts into your territory tomorrow."
Exodus,10,5,"And they will cover the surface of the land, and no one will be able to see the land, and they will eat the remainder of what is left—what is left over for you from the hail—and they will eat every sprouting tree belonging to you from the field."
Exodus,10,6,"And your houses will be full, and the houses of all your servants and the houses of all Egypt, something that your fathers and your grandfathers never saw from the day they were on the earth until this day.’ ” And he turned and went out from Pharaoh."
Exodus,10,7,"And the servants of Pharaoh said to him, “Until when will this be a snare for us? Release the men so that they may serve Yahweh their God. Do you not yet know that Egypt is destroyed?”"
Exodus,10,8,"And Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh, and he said to them, “Serve Yahweh your God. Who are the ones going?"
Exodus,10,9,"And Moses said, “With our young and with our old we will go; with our sons and with our daughters, with our sheep and goats and with our cattle we will go because it is the feast of Yahweh for us.”"
Exodus,10,10,"And he said to them, “Let Yahweh be thus with you as soon as I release you and your dependents. See that evil is before your faces."
Exodus,10,11,"No indeed; just the men go and serve Yahweh, since this is what you are seeking.” And he drove them out from the presence of Pharaoh."
Exodus,10,12,"And Yahweh said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt with the locusts so that they may come up over the land of Egypt, and let them eat all the vegetation of the land, all that the hail left behind.”"
Exodus,10,13,"And Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt, and Yahweh drove an east wind into the land all that day and all night. The morning came, and the east wind had brought the locusts."
Exodus,10,14,"And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and they settled in all the territory of Egypt, very severe. Before it there were not locusts like them, nor will there be after it."
Exodus,10,15,"And they covered the surface of all the land, and the land was dark with them, and they ate all the vegetation of the land and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left, and no green was left in the trees nor in the vegetation of the field in all the land of Egypt."
Exodus,10,16,"And Pharaoh hurried to call Moses and Aaron, and he said, “I have sinned against Yahweh your God and against you."
Exodus,10,17,"And now forgive my sin surely this time, and pray to Yahweh your God so that he may only remove from me this death.”"
Exodus,10,18,"And he went out from Pharaoh, and he prayed to Yahweh."
Exodus,10,19,"And Yahweh turned a very strong west wind and lifted up the locusts and thrust them into the Red Sea, and not one locust remained in all the territory of Egypt."
Exodus,10,20,"And Yahweh hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not release the Israelites."
Exodus,10,21,"And Yahweh said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward the heavens so that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt and so that a person can feel darkness.”"
Exodus,10,22,"And Moses stretched out his hand toward the heavens, and there was darkness of night in all the land of Egypt for three days."
Exodus,10,23,"No one could see his brother, and because of it no one could move from where they were for three days, but there was light for the Israelites in their dwellings."
Exodus,10,24,"And Pharaoh called Moses and said, “Go, serve Yahweh. Only your sheep and goats and your cattle must be left behind. Your dependents may also go with you.”"
Exodus,10,25,"And Moses said, “Even if you yourself put into our hand sacrifices and burnt offerings and we offer them to Yahweh our God,"
Exodus,10,26,our livestock must also go with us. Not a hoof can be left because we must take from them to serve Yahweh our God. And we will not know with what we are to serve Yahweh until we come there.”
Exodus,10,27,"And Yahweh hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he was not willing to release them."
Exodus,10,28,"And Pharaoh said to him, “Go from me. Be careful not to see my face again, because on the day of your seeing my face you will die.”"
Exodus,10,29,"And Moses said, “That is right. I will not again see your face.”"
Exodus,11,1,"And Yahweh said to Moses, “Still one plague I will bring upon Pharaoh and upon Egypt; afterward he will release you from here. At the moment of his releasing, he will certainly drive you completely out from here."
Exodus,11,2,"Speak in the ears of the people, and let them ask, a man from his neighbor and a woman from her neighbor, for objects of silver and objects of gold.”"
Exodus,11,3,"And Yahweh gave the people favor in the eyes of Egypt. Also the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the eyes of the servants of Pharaoh and in the eyes of the people."
Exodus,11,4,"And Moses said, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘About the middle of the night I will go out through the midst of Egypt,"
Exodus,11,5,"and every firstborn in the land of Egypt will die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne to the firstborn of the slave woman who is behind the pair of millstones and every firstborn animal."
Exodus,11,6,"And there will be a great cry of distress in all the land of Egypt, the like of which has not been nor will be again."
Exodus,11,7,"But against all the Israelites, from a man to an animal, a dog will not even bark, so that you will know that Yahweh makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel.’"
Exodus,11,8,"And all of these your servants will come down to me and bow to me, saying, ‘Go out, you and all the people who are at your feet.’ And afterward I will go out.” And he went out from Pharaoh in great anger."
Exodus,11,9,"And Yahweh said to Moses, “Pharaoh will not listen to you, so that my wonders may multiply in the land of Egypt.”"

Exodus,12,1,"And Yahweh said to Moses and to Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,"
Exodus,12,2,“This month will be the beginning of months; it will be for you the first of the months of the year.
Exodus,12,3,"Speak to all the community of Israel, saying, ‘On the tenth of this month, they will each take for themselves a lamb for the family, a lamb for the household."
Exodus,12,4,"And if the household is too small for a lamb, he and the neighbor nearest to his house will take one according to the number of persons; you will count out portions of the lamb according to how much each one can eat."
Exodus,12,5,"The lamb for you must be a male, without defect, in its first year; you will take it from the sheep or from the goats."
Exodus,12,6,"“You will keep it until the fourteenth day of this month, and all the assembly of the community of Israel will slaughter it at twilight."
Exodus,12,7,And they will take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel on the houses in which they eat it.
Exodus,12,8,And they will eat the meat on this night; they will eat it fire-roasted and with unleavened bread on bitter herbs.
Exodus,12,9,"You must not eat any of it raw or boiled, boiled in the water, but rather roasted with fire, its head with its legs and with its inner parts."
Exodus,12,10,And you must not leave any of it until morning; anything left from it until morning you must burn in the fire.
Exodus,12,11,"And this is how you will eat it—with your waists fastened, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand, and you will eat it in haste. It is Yahweh’s Passover."
Exodus,12,12,"“And I will go through the land of Egypt during this night, and I will strike all of the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from human to animal, and I will do punishments among all of the gods of Egypt. I am Yahweh."
Exodus,12,13,"And the blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are, and I will see the blood, and I will pass over you, and there will not be a destructive plague among you when I strike the land of Egypt."

Exodus,12,23,"And Yahweh will go through to strike Egypt, and he will see the blood on the lintel and on the two doorposts, and Yahweh will pass over the doorway and will not allow the destroyer to come to your houses to strike you."
Exodus,12,24,“And you will keep this event as a rule for you and for your children forever.
Exodus,12,25,"And when you come into the land that Yahweh will give to you, as he said, you will keep this religious custom."
Exodus,12,26,"And when your children say to you, ‘What is this religious custom for you?’"
Exodus,12,27,"you will say, ‘It is a Passover sacrifice for Yahweh, who passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt when he struck Egypt; and he delivered our houses.’ ” And the people knelt down and they worshiped."
Exodus,12,28,"And the Israelites went, and they did as Yahweh had commanded Moses and Aaron; so they did."

Exodus,12,33,"And the Egyptians urged the people in order to hurry their release from the land, because they said, “All of us will die!”"
Exodus,12,34,And the people lifted up their dough before it had yeast; their kneading troughs were wrapped up in their cloaks on their shoulder.

Exodus,12,38,"And also a mixed multitude went up with them and sheep and goats and cattle, very numerous livestock."
Exodus,12,39,"And they baked the dough that they had brought out from Egypt as cakes, unleavened bread, because it had no yeast when they were driven out from Egypt, and they were not able to delay, and also they had not made provisions for themselves."
Exodus,12,40,And the period of dwelling of the Israelites that they dwelled in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years.
Exodus,12,41,"And at the end of four hundred and thirty years, on this exact day, all of Yahweh’s divisions went out from the land of Egypt."
Exodus,12,42,It is a night of vigils belonging to Yahweh for bringing them out from the land of Egypt; it is this night belonging to Yahweh with vigils for all of the Israelites throughout their generations.
Exodus,12,43,"And Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron, “This is the statute of the Passover: No foreigner may eat it."
Exodus,12,44,"But any slave of a man, an acquisition by money, and you have circumcised him, then he may eat it."
Exodus,12,45,A temporary resident and a hired worker may not eat it.
Exodus,12,46,It will be eaten in one house; you will not bring part of the meat out from the house to the outside; and you will not break a bone of it.
Exodus,12,47,All of the community of Israel will prepare it.
Exodus,12,48,"And when an alien dwells with you and he wants to prepare the Passover for Yahweh, every male belonging to him must be circumcised, and then he may come near to prepare it, and he will be as the native of the land, but any uncircumcised man may not eat it."
Exodus,12,49,One law will be for the native and for the alien who is dwelling in your midst.”
Exodus,12,50,And all the Israelites did as Yahweh had commanded Moses and Aaron; so they did.
Exodus,12,51,And it was on exactly this day Yahweh brought the Israelites out from the land of Egypt by their divisions.
Exodus,13,1,"And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,"
Exodus,13,2,"“Consecrate to me every firstborn, the first offspring of every womb among the Israelites, among humans and among domestic animals; it belongs to me.”"
Exodus,13,3,"And Moses said to the people, “Remember this day when you went out from Egypt, from a house of slaves, because with strength of hand Yahweh brought you out from here, and food with yeast will not be eaten."
Exodus,13,4,Today you are going out in the month of Abib.
Exodus,13,5,"And when Yahweh brings you to the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Hivites and the Jebusites —which he swore to your ancestors to give to you, a land flowing with milk and honey—you will perform this service in this month."
Exodus,13,6,"Seven days you will eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day will be a feast for Yahweh."
Exodus,13,7,Unleavened bread will be eaten the seven days; food with yeast will not be seen for you; and yeast will not be seen for you in all your territory.
Exodus,13,8,"And you shall tell your son on that day, saying, ‘This is because of what Yahweh did for me when I came out from Egypt.’"
Exodus,13,9,"And it will be as a sign on your hand and as a memorial between your eyes so that the law of Yahweh will be in your mouth, that with a strong hand Yahweh brought you out from Egypt."
Exodus,13,10,And you will keep this statute at its appointed time from year to year.
Exodus,13,11,"“And when Yahweh brings you to the land of the Canaanite, as he swore to you and to your ancestors, and he gives it to you,"
Exodus,13,12,"you will hand over every first offspring of a womb to Yahweh, and every first offspring dropped by a domestic animal that will belong to you, the males will be for Yahweh."
Exodus,13,13,"And every first offspring of a donkey you will redeem with small livestock, and if you will not redeem it, then you will break its neck, and every firstborn human among your sons you will redeem."
Exodus,13,14,"And when your son asks you in the future, saying, ‘What is this?’ you will say to him, ‘With strength of hand Yahweh brought us out from Egypt, from a house of slaves."
Exodus,13,15,"And when Pharaoh was stubborn to release us, Yahweh killed every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from firstborn human to firstborn domestic animal. Therefore I am sacrificing to Yahweh every first offspring of a womb, the males, and every firstborn of my sons I redeem.’"
Exodus,13,16,And it will be as a sign on your hand and as symbolic ornaments between your eyes that with strength of hand Yahweh brought us out from Egypt.”
Exodus,13,17,"And when Pharaoh released the people, God did not lead them the way of the land of the Philistines, though it was nearer, because God said, “Lest the people change their mind when they see war and return to Egypt.”"
Exodus,13,18,"So God led the people around by the way of the desert to the Red Sea, and the Israelites went up in battle array from the land of Egypt."
Exodus,13,19,"And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him because Joseph had made the Israelites solemnly swear an oath, saying, “God will surely attend to you, and you will take up my bones from here with you.”"
Exodus,13,20,"And they set out from Succoth, and they encamped at Etham on the edge of the desert."
Exodus,13,21,And Yahweh was going before them by day in a column of cloud to lead them on the way and by night in a column of fire to give light to them to go by day and night.
Exodus,13,22,The column of cloud by day and the column of fire by night did not depart from before the people.
Exodus,14,1,"And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,"
Exodus,14,2,"“Speak to the Israelites so that they turn and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea; before Baal Zephon, which is opposite it, you will camp by the sea."
Exodus,14,3,"And Pharaoh will say of the Israelites, ‘They are wandering around in the land. The desert has closed in on them.’"
Exodus,14,4,"And I will harden the heart of Pharaoh, and he will chase after them, and I will be glorified through Pharaoh and through all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am Yahweh.” And they did so."
Exodus,14,5,"And it was told to the king of Egypt that the people fled, and the heart of Pharaoh was changed and that of his servants toward the people, and they said, “What is this we have done, that we have released Israel from serving us!”"
Exodus,14,6,And he harnessed his chariot and took with him his people.
Exodus,14,7,And he took six hundred select chariots and all the chariots of Egypt and officers over all of them.
Exodus,14,8,"And Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and he chased after the Israelites. (Now the Israelites were going out boldly.)"
Exodus,14,9,"And the Egyptians chased after them, and they overtook them encamped at the sea—all the horses of the chariots of Pharaoh and his charioteers and his army—at Pi-hahiroth before Baal Zephon."
Exodus,14,10,"And Pharaoh approached, and the Israelites lifted their eyes, and there were the Egyptians traveling after them! And they were very afraid, and the Israelites cried out to Yahweh."
Exodus,14,11,"And they said to Moses, “Because there are no graves in Egypt? Is that why you have taken us to die in the desert? What is this you have done to us by bringing us out from Egypt!"
Exodus,14,12,"Isn’t this the word we spoke to you in Egypt, saying, ‘Leave us alone so that we can serve Egypt!’ because serving Egypt is better for us than our dying in the desert.”"
Exodus,14,13,"And Moses said to the people, “You must not be afraid. Stand still and see the salvation of Yahweh, which he will accomplish for you today, because the Egyptians whom you see today you will see never again."
Exodus,14,14,"Yahweh will fight for you, and you must be quiet.”"
Exodus,14,15,"And Yahweh said to Moses, “Why do you cry out to me? Speak to the Israelites so that they set out."
Exodus,14,16,"And you, lift up your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it so that the Israelites can go in the middle of the sea on the dry land."
Exodus,14,17,"And as for me, look, I am about to harden the heart of the Egyptians so that they come after them, and I will display my glory through Pharaoh and through all of his army, through his chariots and through his charioteers."
Exodus,14,18,"And the Egyptians will know that I am Yahweh when I display my glory through Pharaoh, through his chariots, and through his charioteers.”"
Exodus,14,19,"And the angel of God who was going before the camp of Israel set out and went behind them. And the column of cloud set out ahead of them, and it stood still behind them,"
Exodus,14,20,"so that it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel. And it was a dark cloud, but it gave light to the night, so that neither approached the other all night."
Exodus,14,21,"And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and Yahweh moved the sea with a strong east wind all night, and he made the sea become dry ground, and the waters were divided."
Exodus,14,22,And the Israelites entered the middle of the sea on the dry land. The waters were a wall for them on their right and on their left.
Exodus,14,23,"And the Egyptians gave chase and entered after them—all the horses of Pharaoh, his chariots, and his charioteers—into the middle of the sea."
Exodus,14,24,"And during the morning watch, Yahweh looked down to the Egyptian camp from in the column of fire and cloud, and he threw the Egyptian camp into a panic."
Exodus,14,25,"And he removed the wheels of their chariots so that they drove them with difficulty, and the Egyptians said, “We must flee away from Israel because Yahweh is fighting for them against Egypt.”"
Exodus,14,26,"And Yahweh said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the sea, and let the waters return over the Egyptians, over their chariots, and over their charioteers.”"
