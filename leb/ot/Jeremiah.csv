Jeremiah,13,3,"Now the word of Yahweh came to me a second time, saying,"
Jeremiah,13,4,"“Take the loincloth that you bought, that is on your loins, and stand up, go to the Euphrates and hide it there in the cleft of the rock.”"
Jeremiah,13,5,So I went and hid it by the Euphrates just as Yahweh had commanded me.
Jeremiah,13,6,"And then, after a long time, then Yahweh said to me, “Stand up, go to the Euphrates and take from there the loincloth that I commanded you to hide there.”"
Jeremiah,13,7,"Then I went to the Euphrates and I dug, and I took the loincloth from the place where I had hidden it, and look, the loincloth was ruined; it was not good for anything."

Jeremiah,13,12,"“Therefore, you shall say to them this word, ‘Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: “Every jar must be filled with wine.” ’ And they will say to you, ‘Do we not certainly know that every jar should be filled with wine?’"
Jeremiah,13,13,"Then you shall say to them, ‘Thus says Yahweh: “Look, I am about to fill all the inhabitants of this land, and the kings who sit on David’s throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with drunkenness."

Jeremiah,14,9,"Why should you be like a confused man, like a warrior who is not able to help? Yet you are in our midst, O Yahweh, and your name is called upon us. You must not leave us!"
Jeremiah,14,10,"Thus says Yahweh concerning this people: “They have loved so much to wander, they have not spared their feet. Therefore Yahweh is not favorable to them, now he will remember their iniquity and punish their sins.”"
Jeremiah,14,11,"So Yahweh said to me, “You must not pray for this people, for their happiness."
Jeremiah,14,12,"Although they fast, I am not listening to their cry of entreaty. And although they present burnt offering and grain offering, I am not favorable to them. But by the sword, and by the famine, and by the plague, I am about to destroy them.”"
Jeremiah,14,13,"Then I said, “Ah, Lord Yahweh, look, the prophets are saying to them, ‘You will not see the sword, and famine will not be yours, but reliable peace I will give to you in this place.’ ”"
Jeremiah,14,14,"And Yahweh said to me, “The prophets are prophesying lies in my name. I have not sent them, and I have not commanded them, and I have not spoken to them. They are prophesying to you a lying vision, and a divination, worthless, and the deceitfulness of their minds.”"

Jeremiah,21,4,"‘Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: “Look, I am about to turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, with which you are fighting against them, the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans who are laying siege to you from outside the wall, and I will gather them into the center of this city."

Jeremiah,21,10,"For I have set my face against this city for evil and not for good,” declares Yahweh. It will be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will burn it with fire.” ’"
Jeremiah,21,11,"“And to the house of the king of Judah, ‘Hear the word of Yahweh,"

Jeremiah,22,5,"But if you do not obey these words, I swear by myself,” declares Yahweh, “that this house will become a site of ruins.” ’ ”"

Jeremiah,22,17,"“But there is nothing in your eyes and your heart except your unlawful gain, and on shedding the blood of the innocent, and on committing oppression and extortion.”"
Jeremiah,22,18,"Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, the king of Judah: “They will not lament for him, ‘Alas, my brother,’ or ‘Alas, sister.’ They will not lament for him, ‘Alas, lord,’ or ‘alas, his majesty.’"
Jeremiah,22,19,He will be buried with the burial of a donkey. He will be dragged away and thrown outside the gates of Jerusalem.

Jeremiah,22,23,"Inhabitants of Lebanon, nestled among the cedars, how you will groan when labor pains come to you, fear and pain as the woman who gives birth."
Jeremiah,22,24,"“As I live,” declares Yahweh, “surely if Coniah, the son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, were the seal on my right hand, surely from there I would wrench you off."

Jeremiah,22,26,"And I will throw you and your mother who gave birth to you to another country where you were not born, and there you will die."
Jeremiah,22,27,"As for the land to which they are longing to return, they will not return."
Jeremiah,22,28,"Is this man Coniah a despised, shattered vessel? Or a vessel in which there is no delight? Why are he and his offspring thrown far, and cast away to the land that they do not know?”"
Jeremiah,22,29,"O land, land, land, hear the word of Yahweh."

Jeremiah,23,4,"And I will raise up over them shepherds, and they will shepherd them, and they will no longer fear, and they will not be dismayed, and they will not be missing,” declares Yahweh."
Jeremiah,23,5,"“Look, days are coming,” declares Yahweh, “when I will raise up for David a righteous branch, and he will reign as king, and he will achieve success, and he will do justice and righteousness in the land."
Jeremiah,23,6,"In his days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell in safety, and this is his name by which he will be called: ‘Yahweh is our righteousness.’"
Jeremiah,23,7,"“Therefore look, days are coming,” declares Yahweh, “when they will no longer say, ‘As Yahweh lives, who led up the Israelites from the land of Egypt,’"
Jeremiah,23,8,"but ‘As Yahweh lives, who led up, and who brought the offspring of the house of Israel from the land of the north and from all the lands where he had driven them.’ Then they will live in their land.”"
Jeremiah,23,9,"Concerning the prophets: My heart is broken in my midst. All my bones tremble. I have become like a drunken man, even like a man over whom wine has passed, because of Yahweh, and because of his holy words."
Jeremiah,23,10,"For the land is full of adulterers; for the land mourns because of a curse. The pastures of the desert are dry, and their evil has been their way of running, and their power is not right."

Jeremiah,23,13,“Now in the prophets of Samaria I saw a disgusting thing. They prophesied by Baal and they caused my people Israel to err.
Jeremiah,23,14,"And in the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen something horrible. They commit adultery, and they walk in lies, and they make strong the hands of evildoers, so that they have not turned back each from his wickedness. All of them have become to me like Sodom, and its inhabitants like Gomorrah.”"
Jeremiah,23,15,"Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the prophets, “Look, I am going to let them eat wormwood and I will give them water of poison to drink, for from the prophets of Jerusalem went out ungodliness to all the land.”"
Jeremiah,23,16,"Thus says Yahweh of hosts, “You must not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you. They are deluding you with visions of their mind, They do not speak from the mouth of Yahweh."

Jeremiah,23,21,"I have not sent the prophets, yet they ran. I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied."
Jeremiah,23,22,"But if they had stood in my council, then they would have proclaimed my words to my people, and they would have caused them to turn from their evil way, and from the evil of their deeds."
Jeremiah,23,23,"Am I a God from near,” declares Yahweh, “and not a God from far?"

Jeremiah,23,25,"“I have heard what the prophets who prophesy lies have said in my name, saying, ‘I have dreamed! I have dreamed!’"
Jeremiah,23,26,"How long will this be in the hearts of the prophets who prophesy lies, even the prophets of the deceitfulness of their hearts,"
Jeremiah,23,27,"who plan to make my people forget my name by their dreams that they tell each one to his neighbor, just as their ancestors forgot my name through Baal?"

Jeremiah,23,33,"“Now when this people, or a prophet, or a priest, ask you, saying, ‘What is the burden of Yahweh?’ then you shall say to them, ‘You are the burden, and I will forsake you,’ ” declares Yahweh."
Jeremiah,23,34,"“And the prophet, and the priest, and the people who say, ‘The burden of Yahweh,’ I will punish that man and his house."
Jeremiah,23,35,"Thus you shall say, each one to his neighbor and each one to his brother: ‘What has Yahweh answered?’ or, ‘What has Yahweh spoken?’"
Jeremiah,23,36,"But you shall not mention the burden of Yahweh, for the burden is to each one his word, and so you twist the words of the living God, Yahweh of hosts, our God."
Jeremiah,23,37,"Thus you shall say to that prophet, ‘What has Yahweh answered you?’ or, ‘What has Yahweh spoken?’"
Jeremiah,23,38,"But if you say, ‘The burden of Yahweh,’ therefore thus says Yahweh, ‘because of your saying these words, “The burden of Yahweh,” then I will send to you, saying, “You shall not say, ‘The burden of Yahweh.’ ” ’"
Jeremiah,23,39,"Therefore look, here I am, and I will surely lift you up and forsake you and the city that I gave to you and to your ancestors from my presence,"
Jeremiah,23,40,and I will bring upon you an everlasting disgrace and an everlasting shame that will not be forgotten.”
Jeremiah,24,1,"Yahweh showed me, and look, there were two baskets of figs placed before the temple of Yahweh—after Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had deported Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, with the officials of Judah, and the craftsmen, and the smiths, from Jerusalem and had brought them to Babylon."
Jeremiah,24,2,"The one basket had very good figs, like early figs, and the other basket had very bad figs that could not be eaten because of their bad quality."
Jeremiah,24,3,"And Yahweh asked me, “What are you seeing, Jeremiah?” And I said, “Figs—the good figs, very good, and the bad figs, very bad, that cannot be eaten because of their bad quality.”"
Jeremiah,24,4,"Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,"
Jeremiah,24,5,"“Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, ‘Like these good figs, so I will regard as good the exiles of Judah whom I have sent away from this place to the land of the Chaldeans."
Jeremiah,24,6,"For I will set my eyes on them for good, and I will bring them back to this land. And I will build them and not annihilate them, and I will plant them and not uproot them."
Jeremiah,24,7,"And I will give to them a heart to know me, that I am Yahweh, and they will be my people, and I will be their God, for they will return to me with the whole of their heart."
Jeremiah,24,8,"But like the bad figs that cannot be eaten because of their bad quality—for thus says Yahweh—so I will treat Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his officials, and the remnant of Jerusalem who remain in this land, and those who live in the land of Egypt."
Jeremiah,24,9,"And I will make them as a terror, an evil to all the kingdoms of the earth, as a disgrace and a proverb, as a taunt and a curse, in all the places where I will drive them."
Jeremiah,24,10,"And I will send among them the sword, the famine, and the plague, until they perish from the land that I gave to them and their ancestors.’ ”"
Jeremiah,25,1,"The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, that was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon,"
Jeremiah,25,2,"which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying,"
Jeremiah,25,3,"“From the thirteenth year of Josiah, the son of Amon, the king of Judah, even up to this day, these twenty-three years the word of Yahweh has come to me, and I have spoken to you over and over again, but you have not listened."
Jeremiah,25,4,"And though Yahweh has sent all his servants the prophets to you over and over again you have not listened, and you have not inclined your ear to hear,"
Jeremiah,25,5,"saying, ‘Turn back please, each one from his evil way, and from the evil of your deeds, and live on the land that Yahweh has given to you and to your ancestors from a long time back and until forever,"
Jeremiah,25,6,"and you must not go after other gods to serve them, and to bow in worship to them, and you must not provoke me to anger with the work of your hands, then I will not do something bad to you.’"
Jeremiah,25,7,"‘Yet you have not listened to me,’ declares Yahweh, ‘so that you have provoked me to anger with the work of your hands for your own harm.’"
Jeremiah,25,8,"Therefore thus says Yahweh of hosts, ‘Because you have not obeyed my words,"
Jeremiah,25,9,"look, I am going to send and take all the clans of the north,’ declares Yahweh, ‘and I will send to Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and I will bring them against this land, and against its inhabitants, and against all these nations all around, and I will destroy them, and I will make them a horror, and an object of hissing, and everlasting ruins."
Jeremiah,25,10,"And I will exterminate from them the sound of jubilation, and the sound of joy, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the lamp."
Jeremiah,25,11,"And all this land will become a site of ruins, a desolation, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon seventy years."
Jeremiah,25,12,"And then when the seventy years are fulfilled, I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation,’ declares Yahweh, ‘for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, and I will make it an everlasting waste."
Jeremiah,25,13,"And I will bring upon that land all my words that I have spoken against it, everything that is written in this scroll which Jeremiah prophesied against all the nations."
Jeremiah,25,14,"For many nations and great kings will let them work, even them, and I will repay them according to their deeds, and according to the work of their hands.’ ”"
Jeremiah,25,15,"For thus said Yahweh, the God of Israel, to me, “Take this cup of the wine of wrath from my hand, and you must give it to all the nations to whom I am sending you to drink."
Jeremiah,25,16,"And they will drink, and they will stagger, and they will act like madmen because of the presence of the sword that I am sending among them.”"
Jeremiah,25,17,So I took the cup from the hand of Yahweh and I gave it to all the nations to whom Yahweh sent me to drink:
Jeremiah,25,18,"Jerusalem and the towns of Judah, and its kings, and its officials, to make them a site of ruins, a horror, an object of hissing, and a curse, as it is this day;"
Jeremiah,25,19,"Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and his servants, and his officials, and all his people;"
Jeremiah,25,20,"and all the other people; and all the kings of the land of Uz; and all the kings of the land of the Philistines— Ashkelon, and Gaza, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod;"
Jeremiah,25,21,"Edom, and Moab, and the Ammonites;"
Jeremiah,25,22,"and all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the coastland that is across the sea;"
Jeremiah,25,23,"and Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all those who are trimmed to the side;"
Jeremiah,25,24,"and all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the other people who dwell in the desert;"
Jeremiah,25,25,"and all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of Media;"
Jeremiah,25,26,"and all the kings of the north, near and far, each one to his brother, and all the kingdoms of the world that are on the face of the earth; and the king of Sheshach, he will drink after them."
Jeremiah,25,27,"“And you shall say to them, ‘Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, “Drink and become drunk, and vomit, and fall, and you must not rise because of the presence of the sword that I am sending among you.” ’"
Jeremiah,25,28,"And it will happen, if they refuse to take the cup from your hand to drink, then you shall say to them, ‘Thus says Yahweh of hosts, “You must certainly drink!"
Jeremiah,25,29,"For look, on the city that is called by my name I am beginning to inflict harm, and you indeed, will you go unpunished? You will not go unpunished, for I am summoning a sword against all the inhabitants of the earth,” declares Yahweh of hosts.’"
Jeremiah,25,30,"And you yourself shall prophesy against them all these words, and you shall say to them: ‘Yahweh will roar from on high, and from his holy dwelling place he will give his voice. He will roar mightily against his settlement, a jubilant shout like those who tread grapes, he will answer against all the inhabitants of the earth."
Jeremiah,25,31,"The rage of battle will resound to the end of the earth, for there is a lawsuit of Yahweh against the nations. He is entering into judgment with all wicked flesh, he will give them to the sword,’ declares Yahweh.”"
Jeremiah,25,32,"Thus says Yahweh of hosts, “Look, disaster is going out from nation to nation, and a great tempest is stirred up from the farthest parts of the earth."
Jeremiah,25,33,"And the slain ones of Yahweh will be on that day from one end of the earth to the other end of the earth, and they will not be mourned, and they will not be gathered, and they will not be buried. They will become like dung on the surface of the ground."
Jeremiah,25,34,"Wail, you shepherds, and cry out. And roll about in mourning in the dust, O leaders of the flock. For your days of slaughter and your dispersions have arrived, and you will fall like a vessel of desire."
Jeremiah,25,35,"And flight will perish from the shepherds, and escape from the leaders of the flock."
Jeremiah,25,36,"A sound, the cry of distress of the shepherds and the wailing of the leaders of the flock, for Yahweh is despoiling their pasture."
Jeremiah,25,37,And the peaceful settlements are devastated because of the burning anger of Yahweh.
Jeremiah,25,38,"He has left his den like a lion, for their land has become a horror, because of the anger of the oppressors, and because of his burning anger.”"
Jeremiah,26,1,"At the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, this word came from Yahweh, saying,"
Jeremiah,26,2,"“Thus says Yahweh: ‘Stand in the courtyard of the house of Yahweh, and you must speak to all the cities of Judah that come to bow in worship in the house of Yahweh all the words that I command you to speak to them. You must not omit a word."
Jeremiah,26,3,"Perhaps they will listen and turn back each from his evil way, and I will relent of the disaster that I am planning to do to them because of their evil deeds."
Jeremiah,26,4,"And you shall say to them, “Thus says Yahweh: ‘If you will not listen to me, to walk in my law that I have set before you,"
Jeremiah,26,5,"to listen to the words of my servants the prophets whom I have sent to you, over and over again, though you have not listened,"
Jeremiah,26,6,"then I will make this house like Shiloh, and this city I will make a curse for all the nations of the earth.’ ” ’ ”"
Jeremiah,26,7,And the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the temple of Yahweh.
Jeremiah,26,8,"And then as Jeremiah finished speaking all that Yahweh had commanded him to speak to all the people, then the priests and the prophets and all the people laid hold of him, saying, “You will die!"
Jeremiah,26,9,"Why have you prophesied in the name of Yahweh, saying, ‘This house will be like Shiloh, and this city will be in ruins, without inhabitant’?” And all the people gathered around Jeremiah in the temple of Yahweh."
Jeremiah,26,10,"When the officials of Judah heard these things, they came up from the house of the king to the temple of Yahweh, and they sat in the entrance of the New Gate of Yahweh’s temple."
Jeremiah,26,11,"Then the priests and the prophets said to the officials and to all the people, saying, “This man deserves the death sentence, because he has prophesied against this city as that which you have heard with your ears.”"
Jeremiah,26,12,"Then Jeremiah said to all the officials and to all the people, saying, “Yahweh sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that you have heard."
Jeremiah,26,13,"Now therefore amend your ways and your deeds, and obey the voice of Yahweh your God, and Yahweh will relent of the disaster that he has spoken over you."
Jeremiah,26,14,"But as for me, look, I am in your hand, do to me what is good and right in your eyes."
Jeremiah,26,15,"Only you must certainly know that if you put me to death, you will bring on yourselves innocent blood, and on this city and on its inhabitants, for truly Yahweh sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears.”"
Jeremiah,26,16,"Then the officials and all the people said to the priests and to the prophets, “This man does not deserve a sentence of death, for in the name of Yahweh our God, he has spoken to us.”"
Jeremiah,26,17,"Then men from the elders of the land arose and said to all the assembly of the people, saying,"
Jeremiah,26,18,"“Micah the Morashtite was prophesying in the days of Hezekiah, the king of Judah, and he said to all the people of Judah, saying: ‘Thus says Yahweh of hosts, “Zion will be plowed, and Jerusalem will become a heap of ruins, and the mountain of the temple as high places of wood.” ’"
Jeremiah,26,19,"Did Hezekiah, the king of Judah, and all Judah actually put him to death? Was he not in fear of Yahweh? And he entreated the face of Yahweh, and Yahweh relented of the disaster that he had spoken against them. But we are about to do great disaster to ourselves.”"
Jeremiah,26,20,"Indeed, there also was a man prophesying in the name of Yahweh, Uriah, the son of Shemaiah, from Kiriath-Jearim, and he prophesied against this city and against this land like all the words of Jeremiah."
Jeremiah,26,21,"And when King Jehoiakim, and all his warriors, and all the officials heard his words, then the king sought to put him to death. But Uriah heard, and he was afraid, and he fled and went to Egypt."
Jeremiah,26,22,"Then King Jehoiakim sent men to Egypt. Elnathan, the son of Achbor, and men with him went to Egypt."
Jeremiah,26,23,"And they brought out Uriah from Egypt and they brought him to King Jehoiakim, and he struck him down with the sword, and he threw his dead body into the burial sites of the sons of the people."
Jeremiah,26,24,"However, the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, so that he was not given into the hand of the people to put him to death."
Jeremiah,27,1,"In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying —"
Jeremiah,27,2,"thus said Yahweh to me—“Make for yourself fetters and yokes and put them on your neck,"
Jeremiah,27,3,"and send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Sidon in the hand of the envoys who have come to Jerusalem, to Zedekiah, the king of Judah."
Jeremiah,27,4,"And you must command them for their masters, saying, ‘Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, this you shall say to your masters:"
Jeremiah,27,5,"“I have made the earth with humankind and animals that are on the face of the earth by my great power and by my outstretched arm, and I give it to whomever is right in my eyes."
Jeremiah,27,6,"And now I myself have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and also the animals of the field I have given to him to serve him."
Jeremiah,27,7,"And all the nations will serve him, and his son, and his grandson, until the coming of the time of his own land. Then many nations and great kings will let him work."
Jeremiah,27,8,"“But it will be that the nation or kingdom that will not serve him, Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and that will not put his neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, I will punish that nation with the sword, and with the famine, and with the plague,” declares Yahweh, “until I have destroyed it with my hand."
Jeremiah,27,9,"And you, you must not listen to your prophets, and to your diviners, and to your dreamers, and to your interpreters of signs, and to your sorcerers who are saying, ‘You will not serve the king of Babylon.’"
Jeremiah,27,10,"For they are prophesying to you a lie, so that you will be removed from your land, and I will drive you away, and you will perish."
Jeremiah,27,11,"But the nation that will bring its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and will serve him, yet will I leave it on its land,” declares Yahweh, “and they will till it, and they will live in it.” ’ ”"
Jeremiah,27,12,"And I spoke words like these to Zedekiah, the king of Judah, saying, “Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live."
Jeremiah,27,13,"Why should you die—you and your people—by the sword, by the famine, and by the plague, as Yahweh has spoken concerning the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?"
Jeremiah,27,14,"And you must not listen to the words of the prophets who are speaking to you, saying, ‘You must not serve the king of Babylon,’ for they are prophesying a lie to you."
Jeremiah,27,15,"For I have not sent them,” declares Yahweh, “but they are prophesying in my name falsely, so that I will drive them away. And you will perish—you and the prophets who are prophesying to you.”"
Jeremiah,27,16,"Then I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘You must not listen to the words of your prophets who are prophesying to you, saying, “Look, the vessels of the house of Yahweh are about to be quickly brought back from Babylon”, for they are prophesying a lie to you."
Jeremiah,27,17,And you must not listen to them; serve the king of Babylon and live. Why should this city become a site of ruins?
Jeremiah,27,18,"But if they are prophets, and if there is with them the word of Yahweh, let them please plead with Yahweh of hosts, that the vessels that are left over in the temple of Yahweh, and the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem, must not go to Babylon.’"
Jeremiah,27,19,"For thus says Yahweh of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the stands, and concerning the rest of the vessels that are left in this city,"
Jeremiah,27,20,"which Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, did not take when he deported Jeconiah, the son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, along with all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,27,21,"For thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that are left in the house of Yahweh, and in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem:"
Jeremiah,27,22,"‘They will be brought to Babylon, and there they will stay until the day of my attending to them,’ declares Yahweh. ‘Then I will bring them up and restore them to this place.’ ”"
Jeremiah,28,1,"And it was in that same year, at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah, the king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, that Hananiah, the son of Azzur, the prophet who was from Gibeon, said to me in the house of Yahweh before the eyes of the priests and all the people, saying,"
Jeremiah,28,2,"“Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, ‘I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon."
Jeremiah,28,3,Within two years I will bring back to this place all the vessels of the house of Yahweh which Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon took away from this place and brought to Babylon.
Jeremiah,28,4,"And Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, and all the exiles from Judah who went to Babylon, I will bring back to this place,’ declares Yahweh, ‘For I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.’ ”"
Jeremiah,28,5,"Then Jeremiah the prophet said to Hananiah the prophet before the eyes of the priests and before the eyes of all the people who were standing in the house of Yahweh,"
Jeremiah,28,6,"and Jeremiah the prophet said, “Amen! May Yahweh do so; may Yahweh fulfill your words that you have prophesied, to bring back the vessels of the house of Yahweh and all the exiles from Babylon to this place."
Jeremiah,28,7,"Nevertheless listen please to this word that I am speaking in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people,"
Jeremiah,28,8,"The prophets who were before me and before you from ancient times prophesied against many countries and against great kingdoms of war, and of disaster, and of plague."
Jeremiah,28,9,"The prophet who prophesies peace, at the coming of the word of the prophet, will become known as the prophet that Yahweh has truly sent.”"
Jeremiah,28,10,Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet and broke it.
Jeremiah,28,11,"Then Hananiah said before the eyes of all the people, saying, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘This is how I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, within two years, from the neck of all the nations.’ ” And Jeremiah the prophet went on his way."
Jeremiah,28,12,"And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah after Hananiah the prophet broke the yoke from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, saying,"
Jeremiah,28,13,"“Go, and you must say to Hananiah, saying, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “You have broken yoke bars of wood, but you have made in place of them yoke bars of iron.”"
Jeremiah,28,14,"For thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, “I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations, to serve Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and they will serve him, and I have even given the animals of the open field to him.” ’ ”"
Jeremiah,28,15,"Then Jeremiah the prophet said to Hananiah the prophet, “Please listen, Hananiah, Yahweh has not sent you, and you have made this people trust in a lie."
Jeremiah,28,16,"Therefore thus says Yahweh, ‘Look, I am going to send you from the face of the earth. This year you will die because you have spoken rebellion against Yahweh.’ ”"
Jeremiah,28,17,And Hananiah the prophet died in that same year in the seventh month.
Jeremiah,29,1,"And these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the remainder of the exiles, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had deported from Jerusalem to Babylon,"
Jeremiah,29,2,"after the going out of Jeconiah the king, and the queen mother, and the court officials, the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, and the artisans, and the smiths from Jerusalem,"
Jeremiah,29,3,"by the hand of Elasah, the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah, the son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah, the king of Judah, sent to Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, to Babylon, saying,"
Jeremiah,29,4,"“Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the exiles whom I have deported from Jerusalem to Babylon,"
Jeremiah,29,5,"‘Build houses and live in them, and plant gardens and eat their fruit."
Jeremiah,29,6,"Take wives and father sons and daughters, and take for your sons wives, and give your daughters to men that they may bear sons and daughters, and multiply there, and you must not be few."
Jeremiah,29,7,"And seek the prosperity of the city where I have deported you, and pray on behalf of it to Yahweh, for in its prosperity you will have prosperity.’"
Jeremiah,29,8,"For thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘Do not let your prophets who are in your midst, and your diviners, deceive you, and you must not listen to your dreams that you are causing them to dream."
Jeremiah,29,9,"For they are prophesying falsely to you in my name; I have not sent them,’ declares Yahweh."
Jeremiah,29,10,"For thus says Yahweh, ‘As soon as the time has passed, seventy years for Babylon, I will attend to you, and I will fulfill my good word to you, to bring you back to this place."
Jeremiah,29,11,"For I know the plans that I am planning concerning you,’ declares Yahweh, ‘plans for prosperity and not for harm, to give to you a future and a hope."
Jeremiah,29,12,"Then when you call me, and you come and pray to me, then I will listen to you."
Jeremiah,29,13,"When you search for me, then you will find me, if you seek me with all your heart."
Jeremiah,29,14,"And I will let myself be found by you,’ declares Yahweh, ‘and I will restore your fortunes, and I will gather you from all the nations and from all the places to which I have driven you,’ declares Yahweh, ‘and I will bring you back to the place from which I deported you.’"
Jeremiah,29,15,"Because you have said, ‘Yahweh has raised up prophets for us in Babylon’—"
Jeremiah,29,16,"for thus says Yahweh concerning the king who sits on the throne of David and concerning all the people who live in this city, your fellow kinsmen who did not go with you into the exile—"
Jeremiah,29,17,"thus says Yahweh of hosts, ‘Look, I am going to send among them the sword, the famine, and the plague, and I will make them like rotten figs that cannot be eaten because of their bad quality."
Jeremiah,29,18,"And I will pursue them with the sword, with the famine, and with the plague, and I will make them a terror to all the kingdoms of the earth, a curse, and a horror, and an object of hissing, and a disgrace among all the nations to which I have driven them,"
Jeremiah,29,19,"because they did not listen to my words,’ declares Yahweh, ‘when I sent to them my servants the prophets, sending over and over again, and they would not listen,’ declares Yahweh."
Jeremiah,29,20,"And you, hear the word of Yahweh, all you exiles whom I sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon."
Jeremiah,29,21,"Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab, the son of Kolaiah, and concerning Zedekiah, the son of Maaseiah, who are prophesying to you in my name a lie, ‘Look, I am going to give them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and he will strike them before your eyes."
Jeremiah,29,22,"And a curse will be taken up because of them by all the exiles of Judah who are in Babylon, saying, “May Yahweh make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire,”"
Jeremiah,29,23,"because they have done a disgraceful thing in Israel, and they have committed adultery with the wives of their neighbors, and they have spoken words in my name, lies that I have not commanded them, and I am he who knows, and I am a witness,’ declares Yahweh.”"
Jeremiah,29,24,"And to Shemaiah the Nehelamite you shall say, saying,"
Jeremiah,29,25,"“Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, ‘Because you yourself sent a letter in your name to all the people who are in Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah, the son of Maaseiah, the priest, and to all the priests, saying,"
Jeremiah,29,26,"“Yahweh made you priest instead of Jehoiada the priest, so that there are overseers in the house of Yahweh over any mad man who exhibits the behavior of a prophet, and you must put him into the stocks and into the neck iron,"
Jeremiah,29,27,and so then why have you not rebuked Jeremiah the Anathothite who exhibits the behavior of a prophet for you?
Jeremiah,29,28,"Because he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, ‘It will be a long time, build houses and live in them, and plant gardens and eat their fruit.’ ” ’ ”"
Jeremiah,29,29,And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet.
Jeremiah,29,30,"And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah,29,31,"“Send to all the exiles, saying, ‘Thus says Yahweh concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: “Because Shemaiah prophesied to you, though I have not sent him, and he has made you trust in a lie,”"
Jeremiah,29,32,"therefore thus says Yahweh, “Look, I am going to punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his offspring. There will not be for him a man who lives in the midst of this people, and he will not see the good that I am going to do to my people,” declares Yahweh, “For he has spoken rebellion against Yahweh.” ’ ”"
Jeremiah,30,1,"The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,"
Jeremiah,30,2,"“Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, saying, ‘Write for yourself all the words that I have spoken to you in a scroll."
Jeremiah,30,3,"For look, days are coming,’ declares Yahweh, ‘when I will restore the fortunes of my people Israel and Judah,’ says Yahweh, ‘and I will bring them back to the land that I gave to their ancestors and they will take possession of it.’ ”"
Jeremiah,30,4,Now these are the words that Yahweh spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah.
Jeremiah,30,5,"“For thus says Yahweh: ‘We have heard a sound of trembling, terror, and there is no peace."
Jeremiah,30,6,Ask please and see whether a male can bear a child. Why do I see every strong man with his hands on his loins like a woman giving birth? And why are all their faces changed to paleness?
Jeremiah,30,7,"Alas! For that day is great, there is none like it. And it is a time of distress for Jacob, yet from it he will be delivered."
Jeremiah,30,8,"And it will happen on that day,’ declares Yahweh of hosts, ‘I will break his yoke from your neck and your bonds I will tear to pieces. And strangers will no longer let him work as a slave."
Jeremiah,30,9,"But they will serve Yahweh their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up for them."
Jeremiah,30,10,"But you must not fear, my servant Jacob,’ declares Yahweh, ‘and you must not be dismayed, Israel, for look, I am going to save you from far, and your offspring from the land of their captivity. And Jacob will return, and he will be at rest, and he will be at ease, and there will be no one who makes him afraid."
Jeremiah,30,11,"For I am with you,’ declares Yahweh, ‘to save you. For I will make a complete destruction of all the nations to which I scattered you, but you I will not make a complete destruction. And I will chastise you to the measure, and I will not leave you entirely unpunished.’"
Jeremiah,30,12,"For thus says Yahweh, ‘Your injury is incurable, your wound is overcome by sickness."
Jeremiah,30,13,"There is no one who pleads your cause, for your boil there is no healing for you."
Jeremiah,30,14,"All your lovers have forgotten you, they do not care for you. I have struck you with the blow of an enemy, the punishment of the cruel, because of the greatness of your guilt, your sins are numerous."
Jeremiah,30,15,Why do you cry because of your wound? Your pain is incurable. Because of the greatness of your guilt—your sins are vast— I have done these things to you.
Jeremiah,30,16,"Therefore all those who devour you will be devoured, and all your foes, all of them will go into captivity, and those who plunder you will be as plunder, and all those who plunder you I will make as plunder."
Jeremiah,30,17,"For I will present healing to you, and I will heal you of your wounds,’ declares Yahweh. ‘Because they have called you an outcast, saying, “It is Zion, there is no one who cares for her.” ’"
Jeremiah,30,18,"Thus says Yahweh: ‘Look, I will restore the fortunes of the tents of Jacob, and I will have compassion on his dwellings, and the city will be rebuilt upon its mound, and the citadel fortress will stand on its rightful site."
Jeremiah,30,19,"And thanksgiving and the sound of merrymakers will come out from them, and I will make them numerous, and they will not be few. And I will make them honored, and they will not be lowly."
Jeremiah,30,20,"And their children will be as of old, and their community will be established before me. And I will punish all their oppressors."
Jeremiah,30,21,"And their noble will be from them, and their ruler will come out from their midst. And I will bring him near and he will approach me. For who is he that would pledge his heart to approach me?’ declares Yahweh."
Jeremiah,30,22,"‘And you will be to me a people, and I will be to you God.’ ”"
Jeremiah,30,23,"Look, the storm of Yahweh! Wrath has gone forth, a whirling tempest. It will whirl upon the head of the wicked."
Jeremiah,30,24,"The burning anger of Yahweh will not turn back until his doing, and until his accomplishing the plans of his mind. In the last of the days you will understand it."
Jeremiah,31,1,"“At that time,” declares Yahweh, “I will be the God of all the clans of Israel, and they will be to me a people.”"
Jeremiah,31,2,Thus says Yahweh: “The people of the survivors of the sword found grace in the desert; Israel going to find their rest.”
Jeremiah,31,3,"From afar Yahweh appeared to me, saying, “I have loved you with an everlasting love. Therefore I have drawn you with loyal love."
Jeremiah,31,4,"I will again build you, and you will be built, O virgin Israel. You will again adorn yourself with your tambourines, and you will go forth in the dancing in a ring of the merrymakers."
Jeremiah,31,5,"You will again plant vineyards on the mountains of Samaria. The planters will plant, and they will enjoy it."
Jeremiah,31,6,"For there will be a day when watchmen will call in the hill country of Ephraim, ‘Stand up, and let us go up to Zion, to Yahweh our God.’ ”"
Jeremiah,31,7,"For thus says Yahweh, “Sing for joy for Jacob with gladness, and shout out for the head of the nations. Proclaim, praise, and say, ‘Save, O Yahweh, your people, the remnant of Israel.’"
Jeremiah,31,8,"Look, I am going to bring them from the land of the north, and I will gather them from the remotest part of the earth. Among them the blind, and the lame, those who are pregnant, and those who give birth, together, a great assembly, they will return here."
Jeremiah,31,9,"With weeping they will come, and with pleas for mercy I will bring them; I will let them walk by streams of water in a straight path. They will not stumble in it, for I have become to Israel a father, and Ephraim, he is my firstborn.”"
Jeremiah,31,10,"Hear the word of Yahweh, O nations, and declare in the coastlands from afar, and say, “The scatterer of Israel will gather him, and he will keep him as a shepherd his flock."
Jeremiah,31,11,"For Yahweh has ransomed Jacob, and he has redeemed him from the hand of the person stronger than he."
Jeremiah,31,12,"And they will come, and they will sing for joy on the height of Zion, and they will be radiant over the goodness of Yahweh, over the grain, and over the wine, and over the olive oil, and over the young ones of the flock, and over the cattle. And their life will become like a well-watered garden, and they will never languish again.”"
Jeremiah,31,13,"“Then the young woman will rejoice in the dancing in a ring, and the young men and the old men together. And I will turn their mourning to jubilation, and I will comfort them, and I will gladden them from their sorrow."
Jeremiah,31,14,"And I will saturate the appetite of the priests with fatness, and my people will be satisfied with my goodness,” declares Yahweh."
Jeremiah,31,15,"Thus says Yahweh, “A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation, the weeping of bitterness. Rachel is weeping for her children; she refuses to be comforted because of her children, for they are no more.”"
Jeremiah,31,16,"Thus says Yahweh: “Restrain your voice from weeping, and your eyes from tears, for there is a reward for your work,” declares Yahweh, “and they will return from the land of the enemy."
Jeremiah,31,17,"And there is hope for your future,” declares Yahweh, “and your children will return to their territory."
Jeremiah,31,18,"Indeed I heard Ephraim pitying themselves, ‘You disciplined me, and I was disciplined, like a calf that is not trained. Bring me back and let me return, for you are Yahweh my God."
Jeremiah,31,19,"For after my turning back I repented, and after coming to understand I struck my thigh. I was ashamed and also humiliated, because I bore the disgrace of my youth.’"
Jeremiah,31,20,"Is Ephraim my dear son, or the child of my delight? For as often as I have earnestly spoken against him, I still remember him. Therefore my bowels are turbulent for him, surely I will have compassion on him,” declares Yahweh."
Jeremiah,31,21,"“Set up for yourself road markers, make for yourself signposts, set your mind to the main road, the road by which you went. Return, O virgin of Israel, return to these your cities."
Jeremiah,31,22,"How long will you waver, O unfaithful daughter? For Yahweh has created a new thing on the earth, a woman, she shelters a man.”"
Jeremiah,31,23,"Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, “They will again say these words in the land of Judah and in its towns at my restoring their fortunes, ‘Yahweh bless you, O settlement of righteousness, O hill of holiness.’"
Jeremiah,31,24,"And Judah and all of its towns together will live in it, farmers and those who travel with the flocks."
Jeremiah,31,25,"For I will saturate the thirst of the weary, and every person who languishes I will replenish.”"
Jeremiah,31,26,"At this I awoke and looked, and my sleep was pleasant to me."
Jeremiah,31,27,"“Look, the days are coming,” declares Yahweh, “and I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of humankind, and with the seed of animals."
Jeremiah,31,28,"And then as I have watched over them to pull up, and to tear down, and to annihilate, and to destroy, and to do evil, so I will watch over them to build and to plant,” declares Yahweh."
Jeremiah,31,29,"“In those days they will say no longer, ‘Parents have eaten unripe fruit, and the teeth of the children are set on edge .’"
Jeremiah,31,30,"But each will die because of his iniquity, everyone who eats the unripe fruit, their teeth will be set on edge."
Jeremiah,31,31,"Look, the days are coming,” declares Yahweh, “and I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah,"
Jeremiah,31,32,"not like the covenant that I made with their ancestors on the day of my grasping them by their hand, bringing them out from the land of Egypt, my covenant that they themselves broke, though I myself was a master over them,” declares Yahweh."
Jeremiah,31,33,"“But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days,” declares Yahweh: “I will put my law in their inward parts and on their hearts I will write it, and I will be to them God, and they themselves will be to me people."
Jeremiah,31,34,"And they will no longer teach each one his neighbor, or each one his brother, saying, ‘Know Yahweh,’ for all of them will know me, from their smallest and up to their greatest,” declares Yahweh, “for I will forgive their iniquity and their sin I will no longer remember.”"
Jeremiah,31,35,"Thus says Yahweh, who gives the sun for light by day, the regulations of the moon and the stars for light by night, who stirs up the sea and its waves roar—Yahweh of hosts is his name."
Jeremiah,31,36,"“If these rules would cease from before me,” declares Yahweh, “also the offspring of Israel would cease from being a nation before me forever.”"
Jeremiah,31,37,"Thus says Yahweh, “If the heavens above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth below can be explored, also I will reject all the offspring of Israel because of all that they have done,” declares Yahweh."
Jeremiah,31,38,"“Look, days are coming,” declares Yahweh, “and the city will be rebuilt for Yahweh, from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate."
Jeremiah,31,39,"And the measuring line will still go out immediately in front of it to the hill of Gareb, and it will turn to Goah."
Jeremiah,31,40,"And the whole of the valley of the corpses, and the ashes, and all the cultivated fields up to the wadi of Kidron, up to the corner of the Gate of the Horses toward the east will be holy to Yahweh. It will not be uprooted, and it will not be overthrown again forever.”"
Jeremiah,32,1,"The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the tenth year of Zedekiah the king of Judah, that was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar."
Jeremiah,32,2,"Now at that time the army of the king of Babylon was laying siege to Jerusalem and Jeremiah the prophet was confined in the courtyard of the guard that was in the palace of the king of Judah,"
Jeremiah,32,3,"where Zedekiah, the king of Judah, had confined him, saying, “Why are you prophesying, saying, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “Look, I am going to give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it,"
Jeremiah,32,4,"and Zedekiah, the king of Judah, will not escape from the hand of the Chaldeans, but surely he will be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will speak face to face with him and he will see him eye to eye,"
Jeremiah,32,5,"and to Babylon he will bring Zedekiah, and there he will be until my attending to him,” declares Yahweh. “If you fight against the Chaldeans, you will not be successful” ’?”"
Jeremiah,32,6,"And Jeremiah said, “The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,"
Jeremiah,32,7,"‘Look, Hanamel, the son of Shallum, your uncle, is going to come to you, saying, “Buy for yourself my field that is at Anathoth, for you have the right of redemption to buy it.” ’"
Jeremiah,32,8,"Then Hanamel, the son of my uncle, came to me, to the courtyard of the guard according to the word of Yahweh, and he said to me, ‘Please buy my field that is at Anathoth, that is in the land of Benjamin, for to you is the claim of possession, and to you the redemption; buy it for yourself.’ Then I knew that this was the word of Yahweh."
Jeremiah,32,9,"And I bought the field from Hanamel, the son of my uncle, that was at Anathoth. And I weighed out to him the money, seventeen silver shekels."
Jeremiah,32,10,"And I signed on the letter and sealed it, and I called witnesses as witness, and I weighed out the money on a set of scales."
Jeremiah,32,11,"Then I took the deed of the purchase, the sealed copy containing the commandments and the rules, together with the one that was open."
Jeremiah,32,12,"And I gave the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel, the son of my uncle, and in the presence of the witnesses who signed the deed of the purchase, in the presence of the Judeans who were sitting in the courtyard of the guard."
Jeremiah,32,13,"And I commanded Baruch in their presence, saying,"
Jeremiah,32,14,"‘Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, “Take these deeds, this deed of the purchase, the sealed one, and this opened deed, and you must put them in an earthenware jar so that they may be kept preserved many days.”"
Jeremiah,32,15,"For thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: “Houses and fields and vineyards will again be bought in this land.” ’"
Jeremiah,32,16,"And I prayed to Yahweh—after giving my deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah—saying,"
Jeremiah,32,17,"‘Ah Lord Yahweh! Look, you made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm. Nothing is too difficult for you,"
Jeremiah,32,18,"showing loyal love to the thousands, and repaying the guilt of parents into the laps of their children after them. Powerful, great, mighty, his name is Yahweh of hosts,"
Jeremiah,32,19,"great in counsel and great in deed, whose eyes are opened to all the ways of the children of humankind, to give to each one according to his ways and according to the fruit of his deeds,"
Jeremiah,32,20,"who accomplished signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, up to this day, and in Israel, and among humankind, and you have made for yourself a name, as it is this day."
Jeremiah,32,21,"And you brought out your people Israel from the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with an arm stretched out, and with great terror."
Jeremiah,32,22,"And you gave to them this land, which you swore to their ancestors to give to them, a land flowing with milk and honey."
Jeremiah,32,23,"And they entered and took possession of it, but they did not listen to your voice, and they did not follow your law. They did nothing of all that you commanded to them to do, and you caused to happen to them all this disaster."
Jeremiah,32,24,"Look, the siege ramps have come up to the city to capture it, and the city has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans who are fighting against it, because of the sword, the famine, and the plague, and what you spoke happened, and look, you are seeing it."
Jeremiah,32,25,"Yet you have said to me, Lord Yahweh, “Buy for yourself the field with the money, and call witnesses as witness,” though the city has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans.’ ”"
Jeremiah,32,26,"And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah,32,27,"“Look, I am Yahweh, the God of all flesh; is anything too difficult for me?”"
Jeremiah,32,28,"Therefore thus says Yahweh: “Look, I am going to give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and he will capture it."
Jeremiah,32,29,"And the Chaldeans, who are fighting against this city, will come and set this city on fire, and they will burn it, and the houses where they have made smoke offerings on their roofs to Baal, and where they have devoted libations to other gods, in order to provoke me to anger."
Jeremiah,32,30,"For the people of Israel and the people of Judah were doing only evil in my eyes from their youth, for the people of Israel were only provoking me to anger by the work of their hands,” declares Yahweh."
Jeremiah,32,31,"“For this city has been for me a cause of my anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even until this day, so I will remove it from my sight,"
Jeremiah,32,32,"because of all the evil of the people of Israel and the people of Judah that they did to provoke me to anger—they, their kings, their officials, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,32,33,"And they have turned to me their backs and not their faces, though I have taught them over and over again, but they were not listening to accept discipline."
Jeremiah,32,34,"And they set up their abominations in the house that is called by my name, to defile it."
Jeremiah,32,35,"And they built the high places of Baal that are in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to present as offerings their sons and their daughters to Molech, which I had not commanded them, and it had not come to my mind to do this detestable thing in order to cause Judah to sin.”"
Jeremiah,32,36,"“So now therefore, thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, concerning this city, of which you are saying, ‘It will be given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the plague’:"
Jeremiah,32,37,"Look, I am going to gather them from all the lands to which I driven them in my anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath, and I will bring them back to this place, and I will cause them to dwell in safety."
Jeremiah,32,38,"And they will be for me a people, and I will be for them God."
Jeremiah,32,39,"And I will give to them one heart and one way, to revere me forever, for good to them, and to their children after them."
Jeremiah,32,40,"And I will make with them an everlasting covenant that I will not turn away from them, my doing good to them, and my reverence I will put in their hearts so that they will not turn aside from me."
Jeremiah,32,41,"And I will rejoice over them to do good to them, and I will plant them in this land in faithfulness with all my heart, and with all my inner self.”"
Jeremiah,32,42,"“For thus says Yahweh, ‘Just as I have brought to this people all this great disaster, so I will bring upon them all the good that I promise to them."
Jeremiah,32,43,"And the fields will be bought in this land of which you are saying, “It is a desolation, without humankind or animals. It has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans.”"
Jeremiah,32,44,"They will buy fields with money, and they will sign the deeds, and they will seal them, and they will call witnesses as witness in the land of Benjamin, and in the surroundings of Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the hill country, and in the cities of the Shephelah, and in the cities of the Negev, for I will restore their fortunes,’ declares Yahweh.”"
Jeremiah,33,1,"And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah a second time while he was still held back in the courtyard of the guard, saying,"
Jeremiah,33,2,"“Thus says Yahweh who made the earth, Yahweh who formed it to establish it, Yahweh is his name:"
Jeremiah,33,3,"‘Call to me, and I will answer you, and I will tell you great things and inaccessible things that you have not known.’"
Jeremiah,33,4,"For thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, that were torn down to make a defense against the siege ramps and against the sword:"
Jeremiah,33,5,"‘They are coming to fight against the Chaldeans, and to fill them with the corpses of the people whom I will strike in my anger and in my wrath, for whom I have hidden my face from this city because of all their wickedness."
Jeremiah,33,6,"Look, I am going to bring healing and health to it, and I will heal them, and I will reveal to them abundance of peace and reliability."
Jeremiah,33,7,"And I will restore the fortunes of Judah and the fortunes of Israel, and I will rebuild them as in the beginning."
Jeremiah,33,8,"And I will cleanse them from all their guilt that they sinned against me, and I will forgive all their iniquities that they sinned against me, and that they rebelled against me."
Jeremiah,33,9,"And it will be to me a name of jubilation, a praise, and a glory before all the nations of the earth, who will hear all the good that I will do for them, and they will fear, and they will tremble because of all the good, and because of all the prosperity that I will provide for it.’"
Jeremiah,33,10,"“Thus says Yahweh: ‘Again will be heard in this place, of which you are saying, “It is a waste, without people and without animals,” in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate, without people and without inhabitants and without animals,"
Jeremiah,33,11,"the voice of jubilation, and the voice of joy, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voices of those who say, “Praise Yahweh of hosts, for Yahweh is good, for his loyal love is forever,” the voices of those who bring thank offerings to the house of Yahweh, for I will restore the fortunes of the land as in the beginning,’ says Yahweh."
Jeremiah,33,12,"Thus says Yahweh of hosts: ‘Again there will be in this waste place, without people and animals, and in all its towns, pasture for shepherds allowing their flock to lie down."
Jeremiah,33,13,"In the towns of the hill country, in the towns of the Shephelah, and in the towns of the Negev, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the surroundings of Jerusalem, and in the towns of Judah, flocks will again pass under the hands of the counter,’ says Yahweh."
Jeremiah,33,14,"‘Look, days are coming,’ declares Yahweh, ‘and I will fulfill the good promise that I promised to the house of Israel and to the house of Judah."
Jeremiah,33,15,"In those days and in that time I will make a branch of righteousness sprout for David, and he will execute justice and righteousness in the land."
Jeremiah,33,16,"In those days Judah will be saved, and Jerusalem will dwell safely, and this is what they shall call it: “Yahweh is our righteousness.” ’"
Jeremiah,33,17,For thus says Yahweh: ‘A man who sits on the throne of the house of Israel will not be cut off for David.
Jeremiah,33,18,"And for the priests, a man from the Levites who offers burnt offerings and who burns grain offerings and who brings sacrifices will not be cut off before me forever.’ ”"
Jeremiah,33,19,"And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah,33,20,"“Thus says Yahweh: ‘If you could break my covenant with the day, and my covenant with the night, so that day and night would not come at their time,"
Jeremiah,33,21,"then my covenant could be broken with David my servant, from having a son who could rule on his throne, and with the Levites, the priests, my ministers."
Jeremiah,33,22,"As the host of heaven cannot be counted, and the sand of the sea cannot be measured, so I will make numerous the offspring of David my servant and the Levites who minister to me.’ ”"
Jeremiah,33,23,"And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah,33,24,"“Have you not seen how these people speak, saying, ‘The two clans whom Yahweh chose, he has also rejected them’? Thus they spurn my people from being a nation before them any longer."
Jeremiah,33,25,"Thus says Yahweh: ‘If my covenant with day and with night, the regulations of heaven and earth, I had not established,"
Jeremiah,33,26,"then the offspring of Jacob and David my servant I would reject, from choosing rulers from his offspring over the offspring of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; for I will restore their fortunes and I will have compassion on them.’ ”"
Jeremiah,34,1,"The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, when Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and all his army, with all the kingdoms of the earth under the dominion of his hand, and all the peoples were fighting against Jerusalem and against all its cities, saying,"
Jeremiah,34,2,"“Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: ‘Go and say to Zedekiah the king of Judah, now you must say to him, “Thus says Yahweh: ‘Look, I am going to give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will burn it with fire."
Jeremiah,34,3,"And you will not escape from his hand, but surely you will be captured, and into his hand you will be given, and you will see the king of Babylon eye to eye, and you will speak face to face with him, and to Babylon you will go.’"
Jeremiah,34,4,"However, hear the word of Yahweh, O Zedekiah, the king of Judah. Thus says Yahweh concerning you: ‘You will not die by the sword."
Jeremiah,34,5,"In peace you will die, and as there was burning for your ancestors, the former kings who were before you, so they will burn for you, and they will lament for you, “Alas, lord!” For the word I have spoken,’ declares Yahweh.” ’ ”"
Jeremiah,34,6,Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Zedekiah the king of Judah all these words in Jerusalem
Jeremiah,34,7,"when the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and against all the cities of Judah that were left over—Lachish and Azekah, for these remained among the cities of Judah, the cities of fortification."
Jeremiah,34,8,"The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh after king Zedekiah made a covenant with all the people who were in Jerusalem to proclaim release to them,"
Jeremiah,34,9,"to let go each one his male slave and each one his female slave, the Hebrew and the free Hebrew, so that no one among the Judeans should enslave his fellow countryman."
Jeremiah,34,10,"And all the officials and all the people obeyed, who had entered into the covenant to let go each one his male slave and each one his female slave, not enslaving them again, and they obeyed and they let them go."
Jeremiah,34,11,"But afterward they turned back and they brought back the male slaves and the female slaves whom they had let go free, and they subdued them as male slaves and female slaves."
Jeremiah,34,12,"And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,"
Jeremiah,34,13,"“Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: ‘I made a covenant with your ancestors on the day of my bringing them out from the land of Egypt, from the house of slaves, saying,"
Jeremiah,34,14,"“At the end of seven years you must let go each one his fellow countryman, the Hebrew who has been sold to you and who has served you six years, and you must let him go free from you.” But your ancestors did not listen to me, and they did not incline their ears."
Jeremiah,34,15,"And you turned back recently and you did right in my eyes, to proclaim release each one to his neighbor, and you made a covenant before me in the house that is called by my name."
Jeremiah,34,16,"But you turned back and you profaned my name when you brought back each one his male slave and each one his female slave, whom you had let go free according to their desire, and you subdued them to be to you as male slaves and as female slaves.’"
Jeremiah,34,17,"“Therefore thus says Yahweh, ‘You have not listened to me to proclaim release each one to his fellow countryman and each one to his neighbor. Look, I am going to proclaim to you a release,’ declares Yahweh, ‘to the sword, to the plague, and to the famine, and I will make you a terror to all the kingdoms of the earth."
Jeremiah,34,18,"And I will make the men who transgressed my covenant, who have not kept the words of the covenant that they made before me, like the calf which they cut in two and they passed between its parts—"
Jeremiah,34,19,"the officials of Judah, and the officials of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf—"
Jeremiah,34,20,"and I will give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of the seekers of their lives, and their dead bodies will become as food for the birds of the heavens and for the animals of the earth."
Jeremiah,34,21,"And Zedekiah the king of Judah and his officials I will give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of the seekers of their lives, and into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, who retreated from you."
Jeremiah,34,22,"Look, I am going to command,’ declares Yahweh, ‘and I will bring them back to this city, and they will fight against it, and they will capture it, and they will burn it with fire, and the towns of Judah I will make a desolation without an inhabitant.’ ”"
Jeremiah,35,1,"The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the days of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, saying,"
Jeremiah,35,2,"“Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak with them, and bring them to the house of Yahweh into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.”"
Jeremiah,35,3,"So I took Jaazaniah, the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, and his brothers, and all his sons, and the whole of the house of the Rechabites,"
Jeremiah,35,4,"and I brought them to the house of Yahweh, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was beside the chamber of the officials, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah, the son of Shallum, the keeper of the threshold."
Jeremiah,35,5,"Then I set before the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine and cups, and I said to them, “Drink wine.”"
Jeremiah,35,6,"But they answered, “We will not drink wine, for Jonadab, the son of Rechab, our ancestor, commanded us, saying, ‘You shall not drink wine, you or your children, forever."
Jeremiah,35,7,"And you shall not build a house, and you shall not sow seed, and you shall not plant a vineyard, and it shall not be for you, but in tents you shall live all your days, so that you may live many days on the surface of the land where you are dwelling as aliens.’"
Jeremiah,35,8,"And we obeyed the voice of Jonadab, the son of Rechab, our ancestor, in all that he commanded us, not to drink wine all our days, ourselves, our wives, our sons, or our daughters,"
Jeremiah,35,9,"and not to build houses for our living, and there is not vineyard, or field, or seed for us."
Jeremiah,35,10,"But we have lived in tents, and we have obeyed, and we have done all that Jehonadab, our ancestor, commanded us."
Jeremiah,35,11,"But then at the coming up against the land of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, then we said, ‘Come and let us go to Jerusalem before the army of the Chaldeans, and before the army of the Arameans.’ That is why we are living in Jerusalem.”"
Jeremiah,35,12,"And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah,35,13,"“Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘Go and say to the people of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, “Can you not learn a lesson to listen to my words?” declares Yahweh."
Jeremiah,35,14,"“The words of Jonadab, the son of Rechab, that he commanded his descendants to not drink, have been carried out, and they have not drunk until this day, for they have obeyed the command of their ancestor. But I have spoken to you over and over again, and you have not listened to me."
Jeremiah,35,15,"And I have sent to you all my servants the prophets, I have sent them over and over again, saying, ‘Turn back please each one from his evil way, and amend your deeds, and you must not go after other gods to serve them, so that you may live on the land that I gave to you and to your ancestors.’ But you did not incline your ear and you did not listen to me."
Jeremiah,35,16,"For the descendants of Jonadab, the son of Rechab, have carried out the command of their ancestor that he commanded them, but this people did not listen to me.”"
Jeremiah,35,17,"Therefore thus says Yahweh, the God of hosts, the God of Israel, “Look, I am going to bring to Judah and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem every disaster that I have spoken against them, because I have spoken to them and they have not listened, and I have called to them and they have not answered.” ’ ”"
Jeremiah,35,18,"But to the house of the Rechabites Jeremiah said, “Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘Because you have listened to the command of Jonadab your ancestor, and you have kept all his commands, and you have done all that he commanded you,’"
Jeremiah,35,19,"therefore thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘A man will not be cut off for Jonadab, the son of Rechab, to stand before me always.’ ”"
Jeremiah,36,1,"And then in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,"
Jeremiah,36,2,"“Take for yourself a scroll and you must write on it all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day that I spoke to you, from the days of Josiah, and until this day."
Jeremiah,36,3,"Perhaps when the house of Judah hears all the disasters that I am planning to do to them, then they may turn back each one from his evil way, and I will forgive their guilt and their sin.”"
Jeremiah,36,4,"Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah, and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of Yahweh that he had spoken to him on a scroll."
Jeremiah,36,5,"And Jeremiah instructed Baruch, saying, “I am held back, I am not able to enter the temple of Yahweh."
Jeremiah,36,6,"So you must go and you shall read aloud from the scroll that you have written from my mouth the words of Yahweh in the hearing of the people in the temple of Yahweh on a day of fast, and also you shall read aloud in the hearing of all those of Judah who came from their towns."
Jeremiah,36,7,"Perhaps their plea will fall before Yahweh and each one will turn away from his evil way, for great is the anger and wrath that Yahweh pronounced against this people.”"
Jeremiah,36,8,"And Baruch the son of Neriah did all that Jeremiah the prophet instructed him, to read aloud from the scroll the words of Yahweh in the temple of Yahweh."
Jeremiah,36,9,"And then in the fifth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, in the ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem and all the people who came from the towns of Judah to Jerusalem proclaimed a fast before Yahweh."
Jeremiah,36,10,"Then Baruch read aloud from the scroll the words of Jeremiah in the temple of Yahweh, in the chamber of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, the secretary, in the upper courtyard at the entrance of the New Gate of the temple of Yahweh in the hearing of all the people."
Jeremiah,36,11,"When Micaiah, the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, heard all the words of Yahweh from the scroll,"
Jeremiah,36,12,"he went down to the house of the king, to the chamber of the secretary, and look, all the officials were sitting there: Elishama the secretary, and Delaiah, the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan, the son of Achbor, and Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah, the son of Hananiah, and all the other officials."
Jeremiah,36,13,And Micaiah told them all the words that he had heard at the reading aloud of Baruch from the scroll in the hearing of the people.
Jeremiah,36,14,"Then all the officials sent Jehudi, the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, “The scroll that you read aloud from in the hearing of the people, take it in your hand and come.” And Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and he came to them."
Jeremiah,36,15,"And they said to him, “Sit please and read it aloud in our hearing.” So Baruch read aloud in their hearing."
Jeremiah,36,16,"And then, the moment of their hearing all the words, they turned to one another in alarm and they said to Baruch, “We must certainly report all these words to the king!”"
Jeremiah,36,17,"Then they asked Baruch, saying, “Tell us please, how did you write all these words, from his mouth?”"
Jeremiah,36,18,"And Baruch said to them, “From his mouth. He dictated to me all these words and I was writing on the scroll with the ink.”"
Jeremiah,36,19,"Then the officials said to Baruch, “Go, hide yourself, you and Jeremiah, and let not a man know where you are.”"
Jeremiah,36,20,"And they went to the king, to the courtyard, and they put the scroll for safe-keeping in the chamber of Elishama the secretary, and they reported all the words in the hearing of the king."
Jeremiah,36,21,"Then the king sent Jehudi to take the scroll, and he took it from the chamber of Elishama the secretary, and Jehudi read it aloud in the hearing of the king, and in the hearing of all the officials who stood next to the king."
Jeremiah,36,22,"Now the king was sitting in the quarters of the winter in the ninth month, and a fire-pot was burning before him."
Jeremiah,36,23,"And then, as Jehudi read three or four columns, he would cut it up in pieces with the knife of the scribe, and he would throw it into the fire that was in the fire-pot until the whole of the scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the fire-pot."
Jeremiah,36,24,"And the king and any of his servants who heard all these words were not startled, and they did not tear their garments."
Jeremiah,36,25,"And even when Elnathan, and Delaiah, and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them."
Jeremiah,36,26,"And the king commanded Jerahmeel, the son of the king, and Seraiah, the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah, the son of Abdeel, to arrest Baruch the secretary and Jeremiah the prophet, but Yahweh hid them."
Jeremiah,36,27,"And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah after the king burned the scroll and the words that Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah,36,28,"“Take again for yourself another scroll and write on it all the former words that were in the first scroll which Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, has burned."
Jeremiah,36,29,"And concerning Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, you shall say, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “You have burned this scroll, saying, ‘Why have you written in it, saying, “The king of Babylon will certainly come and he will destroy this land, and he will cause to disappear from it humankind and animals”?’ ”"
Jeremiah,36,30,"Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, “There will not be for him one who sits on the throne of David. And his dead body will be thrown out to the heat in the day and to the frost in the night."
Jeremiah,36,31,"And I will punish him, and his offspring, and his servants for their guilt, and I will bring on them, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and on the people of Judah all the disaster with which I have threatened them, but they would not listen.” ’ ”"
Jeremiah,36,32,"Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch the son of Neriah, the secretary, and he wrote on it from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the scroll that Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, had burned in the fire, and furthermore was added to them many words like these."
Jeremiah,37,1,"And king Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, whom Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, had made king, reigned as king in the land of Judah in place of Coniah, the son of Jehoiakim."
Jeremiah,37,2,But he and his servants and the people of the land did not listen to the words of Yahweh that he spoke by the hand of Jeremiah the prophet.
Jeremiah,37,3,"And king Zedekiah sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, to Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “Please pray for us to Yahweh our God.”"
Jeremiah,37,4,Now Jeremiah was coming and going out in the midst of the people and they had not put him in the house of imprisonment.
Jeremiah,37,5,"And the army of Pharaoh had come out from Egypt, and the Chaldeans, who were laying siege to Jerusalem, heard their report and they withdrew from Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,37,6,"And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah the prophet, saying,"
Jeremiah,37,7,"“Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, ‘This is what you shall say to the king of Judah, who sent you to me to inquire of me, “Look, the army of Pharaoh, which set out to help you, is going to return to his land Egypt."
Jeremiah,37,8,"And the Chaldeans will return, and they will fight against this city, and they will capture it, and they will burn it with fire.” ’"
Jeremiah,37,9,"Thus says Yahweh: ‘You must not deceive yourselves, saying, “Surely the Chaldeans will go from us,” for they will not go."
Jeremiah,37,10,"For even if you struck the whole army of the Chaldeans who are fighting against you, and only men pierced through remained among them, each one in his tent, they would rise up and they would burn this city with fire.’ ”"
Jeremiah,37,11,"And then, at the withdrawing of the army of the Chaldeans from Jerusalem before the army of Pharaoh,"
Jeremiah,37,12,Jeremiah set out from Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin to receive a portion from there in the midst of the people.
Jeremiah,37,13,"And when he was at the Gate of Benjamin, there was a sentry on duty whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah, and he seized Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “You are deserting to the Chaldeans!”"
Jeremiah,37,14,"And Jeremiah said, “That is a lie! I am not deserting to the Chaldeans.” But he would not listen to him. So Irijah seized Jeremiah and brought him to the officials."
Jeremiah,37,15,"And the officials were angry at Jeremiah and they struck him. And they put him in prison, in the house of Jonathan the secretary, for they had converted it to the prison."
Jeremiah,37,16,"So Jeremiah came to the dungeon , even to the vaulted cells, and Jeremiah stayed there many days."
Jeremiah,37,17,"Then King Zedekiah sent and fetched him. And the king questioned him in secrecy in his house, and he said, “Is there a word from Yahweh?” And Jeremiah said, “There is.” And he said, “You will be given into the hand of the king of Babylon.”"
Jeremiah,37,18,"Then Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, “What did I do wrong to you, or to your servants, or to this people, that you have put me in prison?"
Jeremiah,37,19,"And where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you and against this land’?"
Jeremiah,37,20,"Now then, my lord the king, please let my plea fall before you. You must not send me back to the house of Jonathan the secretary, so that I will not die there.”"
Jeremiah,37,21,"So King Zedekiah commanded, and they handed Jeremiah over in the courtyard of the guard, and they gave to him a round loaf of bread from the street of the bakers every day until the finishing of all the bread from the city. And Jeremiah stayed in the courtyard of the guard."
Jeremiah,38,1,"Now Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, and Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchiah heard the words that Jeremiah was saying to all the people, saying,"
Jeremiah,38,2,"“Thus says Yahweh, ‘The one who stays in this city will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the plague. But the one who goes out to the Chaldeans will live. And his life will be for him as booty, and he will live.’"
Jeremiah,38,3,"Thus says Yahweh, ‘Surely this city will be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it.’ ”"
Jeremiah,38,4,"Then the officials said to the king, “Please, this man must be killed, because he is making slack the hands of the soldiers who are left in this city, and the hands of all the people, by speaking to them words like these, for this man is not seeking for welfare to this people, but only for harm.”"
Jeremiah,38,5,"And Zedekiah the king said, “Look, he is in your hand, for the king is not able to do a thing against you.”"
Jeremiah,38,6,"So they took Jeremiah and threw him into the pit of Malchiah, the son of the king, which was in the courtyard of the guard. And they let Jeremiah down by ropes. Now in the pit there was no water, but only mud, and Jeremiah sank in the mud."
Jeremiah,38,7,"When Ebed-melech the Cushite, a eunuch who was in the house of the king, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the pit —now the king was sitting at the Gate of Benjamin—"
Jeremiah,38,8,"Ebed-melech went out from the house of the king and spoke to the king, saying,"
Jeremiah,38,9,"“My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, in that they have thrown him into the pit, and he will die there because of starvation, for there is no longer any bread in the city.”"
Jeremiah,38,10,"Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Cushite, saying, “Take with you these thirty men and pull Jeremiah the prophet up from the pit before he dies.”"
Jeremiah,38,11,"So Ebed-melech took the men with him and went to the palace of the king, to a place beneath the storehouse, and he took from there rags and worn-out clothes. And he let them down into the pit by ropes to Jeremiah."
Jeremiah,38,12,"Then Ebed-melech the Cushite said to Jeremiah, “Please put the rags and worn-out clothes under the joints of your arms under the ropes,” and Jeremiah did so."
Jeremiah,38,13,And they pulled Jeremiah by the ropes and brought him up from the pit. And Jeremiah stayed in the courtyard of the guard.
Jeremiah,38,14,"And Zedekiah the king sent and made someone bring Jeremiah the prophet to him, to the third entrance that was at the temple of Yahweh. And the king said to Jeremiah, “I am asking you something, you must not hide anything from me.”"
Jeremiah,38,15,"And Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I tell you, will you not surely kill me? Besides, if I advise you, you will not listen to me."
Jeremiah,38,16,"So Zedekiah the king swore to Jeremiah in secret, saying, “As Yahweh lives, who has made for us this life, I will not kill you and I will not give you into the hand of these men who are seeking your life.”"
Jeremiah,38,17,"Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “Thus says Yahweh, the God of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘If only you will go surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then you will live, and this city will not be burned with fire, and you will live, you and your house."
Jeremiah,38,18,"But if you do not go surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then this city will be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they will burn it with fire, and you will not escape from their hand.’ ”"
Jeremiah,38,19,"And Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Judeans who have deserted to the Chaldeans, lest they give me into their hand and they abuse me.”"
Jeremiah,38,20,"And Jeremiah said, “They will not give you over. Please obey the voice of Yahweh with regard to what I am saying to you, and it will go well with you, and you will live."
Jeremiah,38,21,"But if you are refusing to surrender, this is the thing that Yahweh has shown me."
Jeremiah,38,22,"Now look, all the women who remain in the house of the king of Judah are being led out to the officials of the king of Babylon. And look, they are saying, ‘Your trusted friends have misled you, and they have prevailed against you. Your feet are stuck in the mud, so they turned backward.’"
Jeremiah,38,23,"And all your wives and your children will be led out to the Chaldeans, and you will not escape from their hand, but by the hand of the king of Babylon you will be seized, and this city will burn with fire.”"
Jeremiah,38,24,"And Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “No man must know about these words so that you will not die."
Jeremiah,38,25,"And if the officials hear that I have spoken with you, and they come to you and say to you, ‘Please tell us what you said to the king. You must not conceal it from us so that we will not kill you. And what did the king say to you?’"
Jeremiah,38,26,"Then you shall say to them, ‘I was presenting my plea before the king, to not cause me to return to the house of Jonathan to die there.’ ”"
Jeremiah,38,27,"And all the officials came to Jeremiah and questioned him, and he informed them like all these words that the king commanded. So they fell silent, for the conversation was not heard."
Jeremiah,38,28,And Jeremiah stayed in the courtyard of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was captured. And it happened that Jerusalem was captured.
Jeremiah,39,1,"In the ninth year of Zedekiah, the king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem and laid siege to it."
Jeremiah,39,2,"In the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the city was taken by assault."
Jeremiah,39,3,"And all the officials of the king of Babylon came and sat in the Middle Gate: Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim the chief officer, Nergal-sharezer the high official, with all the rest of the officials of the king of Babylon."
Jeremiah,39,4,"And then when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all the soldiers with him, they fled and went out at night from the city by the way of the garden of the king through the gate between the walls. And they went out toward the Jordan Valley."
Jeremiah,39,5,But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. And they took him and brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath. And he pronounced sentence on him.
Jeremiah,39,6,And the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah at Riblah before his eyes. The king of Babylon also slaughtered all the nobles of Judah.
Jeremiah,39,7,Then he blinded the eyes of Zedekiah and tied him up with bronze fetters to bring him to Babylon.
Jeremiah,39,8,And the Chaldeans burned the palace of the king and the houses of the people with fire and broke down the walls of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah,39,9,"Then the rest of the people who were left in the city, and those deserting who had deserted to him, and the rest of the people who remained, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, deported to Babylon."
Jeremiah,39,10,"And some of the poor people, who had nothing, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, left in the land of Judah. And he gave them vineyards and fields on that day."
Jeremiah,39,11,"And Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon commanded concerning Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, saying,"
Jeremiah,39,12,"“Take him and set your eyes on him. And you must not do something bad to him, but only that which he speaks to you, so do with him.”"
Jeremiah,39,13,"So Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, sent word, along with Nebushazban the chief officer, and Nergal-sharezer the high official, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon."
Jeremiah,39,14,"And they sent and took Jeremiah from the courtyard of the guard and gave him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, to take him to the house, so he stayed in the midst of the people."
Jeremiah,39,15,"And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah at his confinement in the courtyard of the guard, saying,"
Jeremiah,39,16,"“Go and say to Ebed-melech the Cushite, saying, ‘Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: “Look, I am about to bring my words to pass against this city for evil and not for good. And they will be before you on that day."
Jeremiah,39,17,"But I will rescue you on that day,” declares Yahweh, “and you will not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are frightened."
Jeremiah,39,18,"For surely I will save you, and you will not fall by the sword. But your life will be for you as booty because you have trusted in me,” declares Yahweh.’ ”"
Jeremiah,40,1,"The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh after Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, had let him go from Ramah, where he had been taken bound in chains in the midst of all the exiles of Jerusalem and Judah who were being deported to Babylon."
Jeremiah,40,2,"And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him, “Yahweh your God threatened this disaster to this place,"
Jeremiah,40,3,"and now he has brought it about, and Yahweh has done just as he threatened. Because you sinned against Yahweh and did not listen to his voice, so this thing has happened to you."
Jeremiah,40,4,"And so then look, I have released you today from the chains that were on your hands. If it is good in your eyes to come with me to Babylon, then come, and I will take care of you. But if it is bad in your eyes to come with me to Babylon, then refrain. Look, the whole land is before you. To wherever it is good and right in your eyes to go, then go there.”"
Jeremiah,40,5,"While he still had not turned back, Nebuzaradan added, “Return to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed in an official position over the towns of Judah, and stay with him in the midst of the people. Or to wherever it is right in your eyes to go, then go there.” Then the captain of the guard gave him an allowance of provisions and a present, and let him go."
Jeremiah,40,6,"So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, at Mizpah and stayed with him in the midst of the people who were left in the land."
Jeremiah,40,7,"When all the commanders of the armies who were in the open country and their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam in an official position in the land, and that he had put him in charge of men, and women, and little children, and of the poor of the land, of all those who had not been deported to Babylon,"
Jeremiah,40,8,"then they went to Gedaliah at Mizpah—Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan, and Jehonathan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men."
Jeremiah,40,9,"And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, swore to them and to their men, saying, “You must not be afraid of serving the Chaldeans. Stay in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well with you."
Jeremiah,40,10,"As for me, look, I am staying at Mizpah to represent you before the Chaldeans who come to us. But you, gather wine and summer fruit and oil, and put them in your vessels, and live in your towns that you have seized.”"
Jeremiah,40,11,"And also all the Judeans who were in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and who were in all the lands, when they heard that the king of Babylon had given a remnant to Judah and that he had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, in an official position over them,"
Jeremiah,40,12,"then all the Judeans returned from all the places to which they were scattered. And they came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and they gathered wine and summer fruit that yielded in great abundance."
Jeremiah,40,13,And Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies who were in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah
Jeremiah,40,14,"and said to him, “Are you at all aware that Baalis, the king of the Ammonites, has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, to kill you?” But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam would not believe them."
Jeremiah,40,15,"Then Johanan the son of Kareah said to Gedaliah in secrecy at Mizpah, saying, “Please let me go and kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and nobody will know. Why should he kill you, so that all of Judah who are gathered to you will be scattered, and the remnant of Judah will perish?”"
Jeremiah,40,16,"But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, “You must not do this thing, for you are telling a lie about Ishmael.”"
Jeremiah,41,1,"And then in the seventh month Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, from the offspring of the kingship, and one of the chief officers of the king, came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam at Mizpah, along with ten men. And they ate bread together there at Mizpah."
Jeremiah,41,2,"And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah got up, along with the ten men who were with him, and they struck Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the sword and killed him whom the king of Babylon had appointed in an official position over the land."
Jeremiah,41,3,"Then Ishmael killed all the Judeans who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, along with the Chaldeans who were found there, the soldiers."
Jeremiah,41,4,And then on the second day of the killing of Gedaliah—and no one knew—
Jeremiah,41,5,"then men came from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, eighty men with shaven beards and torn garments, who had cut themselves with blades, having grain offerings and frankincense in their hands to bring to the temple of Yahweh."
Jeremiah,41,6,"And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah came out to meet them from Mizpah, weeping as he came. And then as he was meeting them, he said to them, “Come to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam.”"
Jeremiah,41,7,"And then, the moment of their coming to the middle of the city, then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, along with the men who were with him, slaughtered them and threw them to the middle of the pit."
Jeremiah,41,8,"But ten men were found among them, and they said to Ishmael, “You must not kill us, for we have hidden treasures in the field, wheat, and barley, and oil, and honey. So he refrained and he did not kill them in the midst of their fellow countrymen."
Jeremiah,41,9,"Now the pit into which Ishmael threw all the corpses of the men whom he had killed along with Gedaliah was the same one that King Asa had made because of Baasha the king of Israel, who was against him. Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain ones."
Jeremiah,41,10,"Then Ishmael took captive all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah, the daughters of the king and all the people who were left at Mizpah, over whom Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. And Ishmael took them captive and set out to cross over to the Ammonites."
Jeremiah,41,11,"When Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies who were with him, heard all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,"
Jeremiah,41,12,then they took all the men and went to fight against Ishmael the son of Nethaniah. And they met him at the great pool that is in Gibeon.
Jeremiah,41,13,"And then, the moment that all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies who were with him, they were glad."
Jeremiah,41,14,So all the people whom Ishmael had taken captive from Mizpah turned around and returned and went to Johanan the son of Kareah.
Jeremiah,41,15,"But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped with eight men from Johanan, and they went to the Ammonites."
Jeremiah,41,16,"Then Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies who were with him took from Mizpah all the rest of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, after he had killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, strong men, soldiers, and women, and little children, and eunuchs whom he brought back from Gibeon."
Jeremiah,41,17,"And they set out and stayed at the lodging place of Chimham that is near Bethlehem, intending to go to Egypt"
Jeremiah,41,18,"because of the Chaldeans. For they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had appointed in an official position over the land."
Jeremiah,42,1,"Then all the commanders of the armies, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the smallest to the greatest, approached"
Jeremiah,42,2,"and said to Jeremiah the prophet, “May our plea please fall before you, and pray for us to Yahweh your God, for all this remnant, for we are left but a few of many, as your eyes are seeing us."
Jeremiah,42,3,And let Yahweh your God inform us the way in which we should go and the thing that we should do.”
Jeremiah,42,4,"And Jeremiah the prophet said to them, “I have heard. Look, I am going to pray to Yahweh your God according to your words, and then all the words that Yahweh answers you I will tell you; I will not withhold from you a word.”"
Jeremiah,42,5,"Then they said to Jeremiah, “May Yahweh be against us as a true and faithful witness if we do not do according to all the words that Yahweh sends you for us."
Jeremiah,42,6,"Whether good or bad, we will listen to the voice of Yahweh our God, to whom we are sending you, so that it may go well with us when we listen to the voice of Yahweh our God.”"
Jeremiah,42,7,And then at the end of ten days the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah.
Jeremiah,42,8,"And he summoned Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the commanders of the armies who were with him, and all the people from the smallest to the greatest,"
Jeremiah,42,9,"and said to them, “Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to cause your plea to fall before him:"
Jeremiah,42,10,"‘If only you will stay in this land, then I will build you and I will not tear you down, and I will plant you and I will not pluck you up, for I relent of the disaster that I have brought to you."
Jeremiah,42,11,"You must not be afraid of the king of Babylon whom you are afraid of. You must not be afraid of him,’ declares Yahweh, ‘for I am with you to save you and to deliver you from his hand."
Jeremiah,42,12,"And I will show you compassion, and he will have compassion on you and will restore you to your soil."
Jeremiah,42,13,"But if you are saying, “We will not stay in this land,” so as to not listen to the voice of Yahweh your God,"
Jeremiah,42,14,"saying, “No, for we will go to the land of Egypt where we will not see war, and we will not hear the sound of a horn, and we will not be hungry for bread, and there we will stay,”"
Jeremiah,42,15,"then therefore hear the word of Yahweh, O remnant of Judah. Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: “If you are determined to go to Egypt, and you go to dwell as aliens there,"
Jeremiah,42,16,"then it will be that the sword that you are in fear of will overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine that you are anxious of will pursue after you there into Egypt, and there you will die."
Jeremiah,42,17,"So all the people who are determined to go to Egypt to dwell as aliens there will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the plague, and there will not be for them an escapee or a survivor from the disaster that I am bringing upon them.”"
Jeremiah,42,18,"For thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: “As my anger and my wrath were poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so my wrath will pour out on you at your going to Egypt, and you will become a curse, and a horror, and a curse formula, and a disgrace, and you will no longer see this place.” ’"
Jeremiah,42,19,"Yahweh has spoken to you, O remnant of Judah, ‘You must not go to Egypt.’ You must certainly know that I have warned you today"
Jeremiah,42,20,"that you have made a fatal mistake, for you sent me to Yahweh your God, saying, ‘Pray for us to Yahweh our God, and all that Yahweh our God says, so tell us and we will do it.’"
Jeremiah,42,21,"So I have told you today, and you have not listened to the voice of Yahweh your God, or of anything that he sent me for you."
Jeremiah,42,22,"Now then, certainly you must know that by the sword, by the famine, and by the plague you will die in the place where you desire to go, to dwell as aliens there.”"
Jeremiah,43,1,"And then, when Jeremiah had finished speaking to all the people all the words of Yahweh their God, for which Yahweh their God had sent him to them with all these words,"
Jeremiah,43,2,"Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the insolent men spoke, saying to Jeremiah, “You are telling a lie! Yahweh our God did not send you, saying, ‘You must not go to Egypt to dwell as aliens there.’"
Jeremiah,43,3,"But Baruch the son of Neriah is inciting you against us in order to give us into the hand of the Chaldeans, to kill us and to deport us to Babylon.”"
Jeremiah,43,4,"So Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies, and all the people did not listen to the voice of Yahweh to stay in the land of Judah."
Jeremiah,43,5,But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies took all the remnant of Judah who had returned from all the nations to which they had been scattered to dwell as aliens in the land of Judah—
Jeremiah,43,6,"the men, and the women, and the little children, and the daughters of the king, and everyone whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah—"
Jeremiah,43,7,"and they came into the land of Egypt, for they did not listen to the voice of Yahweh. And they came up to Tahpanhes."
Jeremiah,43,8,"And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,"
Jeremiah,43,9,"“Take in your hands large stones and bury them in the mortar in the clay floor that is at the entrance of the palace of Pharaoh in Tahpanhes before the eyes of the people of the Judeans,"
Jeremiah,43,10,"and say to them, ‘Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: “Look, I am going to send and take Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and I will set his throne above these stones that I have hidden. And he will spread out his canopy over them."
Jeremiah,43,11,"And he will come and ravage the land of Egypt, and deliver those who are appointed for the plague, to the plague, and those who are appointed for the captivity, to the captivity, and those who are appointed for the sword, to the sword."
Jeremiah,43,12,"Then he will kindle a fire in the temples of the gods of Egypt, and he will burn them and take them captive. And he will wrap up the land of Egypt just as the shepherd wraps up his cloak. And he will go forth from there in peace."
Jeremiah,43,13,"And he will break the stone pillars of Heliopolis, which is in the land of Egypt. And he will burn the temples of the gods of Egypt with fire.” ’ ”"
Jeremiah,44,1,"The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Judeans who were living in the land of Egypt, who were living at Migdol, and Tahpanhes, and Memphis, and in the land of Pathros, saying,"
Jeremiah,44,2,"“Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘You yourselves have seen all the disaster that I have brought on Jerusalem, and on all the towns of Judah. And look, they are a site of ruins this day, and there is not in them an inhabitant,"
Jeremiah,44,3,"because of their wickedness that they committed to provoke me to anger by going to make smoke offerings, serving other gods whom they had not known, neither they, you, or your ancestors."
Jeremiah,44,4,"And I sent to you all my servants the prophets, sending over and over again, saying, “Please, you must not do this detestable thing that I hate.”"
Jeremiah,44,5,"But they did not listen and they did not incline their ears to turn back from their wickedness, to not make smoke offerings to other gods."
Jeremiah,44,6,"So my wrath and my anger were poured out and burned in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, and they became as a site of ruins, as a desolation, as they are this day.’"
Jeremiah,44,7,"So then, thus says Yahweh, the God of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘Why are you doing great harm to yourselves, to cut off for yourselves man and woman, child and suckling, from the midst of Judah, to not leave over for yourselves a remnant,"
Jeremiah,44,8,"provoking me to anger with the works of your hands, to make smoke offerings to other gods in the land of Egypt where you have come to dwell as aliens, so as to cut off yourselves, and so that you are becoming as a curse, and as a disgrace among all the nations of the earth?"
Jeremiah,44,9,"Have you forgotten the wicked things of your ancestors, and the wicked things of the kings of Judah, and the wicked things of their wives, and your wicked things, and the wicked things of your wives, which they committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?"
Jeremiah,44,10,"They have not shown contrition up to this day, and they have not shown reverence, and they have not walked in my law and in my statutes that I set before you and before your ancestors.’"
Jeremiah,44,11,"Therefore thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘Look, I am determined to bring disaster on you, even to exterminate all Judah."
Jeremiah,44,12,"And I will take away the remnant of Judah who are determined to come to the land of Egypt to dwell as aliens there, and everyone will perish. They will fall in the land of Egypt by the sword; they will perish by the famine, from the smallest to the greatest. By the sword and by the famine they will die and become as a curse, as a horror, and as a curse, and as a disgrace."
Jeremiah,44,13,"So I will punish those who live in the land of Egypt just as I have punished Jerusalem, with the sword, with the famine, and with the plague."
Jeremiah,44,14,"And there will not be a survivor or an escapee of the remnant of Judah, those who have come to dwell as an alien there in the land of Egypt, to return to the land of Judah where they are longing to return to dwell there, for they will not turn back, but only some survivors.’ ”"
Jeremiah,44,15,"Then all the men who knew that their wives were making smoke offerings to other gods, and all the women who stood by, a great assembly, and all the people who lived in the land of Egypt in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah,44,16,"“Concerning the word that you have spoken to us in the name of Yahweh, we are not going to listen to you!"
Jeremiah,44,17,"But certainly we will do everything that went out from our mouths, to make smoke offerings to the queen of heaven and to pour out to her libations just as we did, we, and our ancestors, our kings, and our officials, in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, for then we had enough to eat, and we were well-off, and we did not see disaster."
Jeremiah,44,18,"But since we stopped making smoke offerings to the queen of heaven and pouring out libations to her, we have lacked everything, and by the sword and by the famine we have perished."
Jeremiah,44,19,"And indeed, when we were making smoke offerings to the queen of heaven and pouring out to her libations, was it not with the consent of our husbands that we made for her sacrificial cakes marked with her image, and we poured out to her libations?”"
Jeremiah,44,20,"Then Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men and to the women, and to all the people who answered him a word, saying,"
Jeremiah,44,21,"“The offering that you made, smoke offerings in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, you, and your ancestors, your kings, and your officials, and the people of the land, did not Yahweh remember them, and did it not come to his mind?"
Jeremiah,44,22,"And Yahweh was no longer able to bear it, because of the evil of your deeds, because of the detestable things that you committed. Thus your land became as a site of ruins, and as a horror, and as a curse, without inhabitants, as it is this day."
Jeremiah,44,23,"Because of the fact that you made smoke offerings, and that you sinned against Yahweh, and you did not listen to the voice of Yahweh, and you have not walked in his law, and in his statute, and in his legal provisions, therefore this disaster has happened to you, as it is this day.”"
Jeremiah,44,24,"Then Jeremiah said to all the people and to all the women, “Hear the word of Yahweh, all Judah who are in the land of Egypt."
Jeremiah,44,25,"Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, ‘You and your wives have promised with your mouths and with your hands you have fulfilled, saying, “We certainly will carry out our vows that we vowed, to make smoke offerings to the queen of the heavens, and to pour out to her libations.” You must certainly keep your vows and you must certainly carry out your vows.’"
Jeremiah,44,26,"Therefore hear the word of Yahweh, all Judah, those who live in the land of Egypt: ‘Look, I hereby swear by my great name,’ says Yahweh, ‘surely my name will no longer be called in the mouth of any man of Judah, saying, “as the Lord Yahweh lives,” in all the land of Egypt."
Jeremiah,44,27,"Look, I am going to watch over them for harm and not for good, and all people of Judah who are in the land of Egypt will perish by the sword and by the famine until their perishing."
Jeremiah,44,28,"And the survivors of the sword will return from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah few in number. And all the remnant of Judah who have come to the land of Egypt to dwell as aliens there will know whose word will endure, from me or from them."
Jeremiah,44,29,"And this will be to you the sign,’ declares Yahweh, ‘that I am going to punish you in this place, so that you may know that surely my words will endure against you for evil.’"
Jeremiah,44,30,"Thus says Yahweh: ‘Look, I am going to give Pharaoh Hophra, the king of Egypt, into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of those who seek his life, just as I gave Zedekiah the king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, his enemy and the one who sought his life.’ ”"
Jeremiah,45,1,"The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch, the son of Neriah, at his writing these words on a scroll from the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, saying,"
Jeremiah,45,2,"“Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, to you, O Baruch:"
Jeremiah,45,3,"‘You said, “Woe please to me, for Yahweh has added sorrow to my pain. I am weary in my groaning and I do not find rest.” ’"
Jeremiah,45,4,"Thus you will say to him: ‘Thus says Yahweh, “Look, what I have built I am about to tear down, and what I have planted I am about to pluck up, it is all the land."
Jeremiah,45,5,"And you, do you seek great things for yourself? Do not seek great things, for look, I am about to bring disaster upon all flesh,” declares Yahweh, “but to you I will give your life as booty in all the places where you may go.” ’ ”"

Jeremiah,52,12,"Now in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, who stood before the king of Babylon, entered into Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,52,13,"And he burned the temple of Yahweh, and the palace of the king, and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house he burned with fire."
Jeremiah,52,14,And all the army of the Chaldeans who were with the captain of the guard broke down all the walls of Jerusalem all around.
Jeremiah,52,15,"And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard deported some of the poor of the people, and the rest of the people who were left in the city, and the deserters who deserted to the king of Babylon, along with the rest of the craftsmen."
Jeremiah,52,16,But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poor of the land to serve as vinedressers and farmers.
Jeremiah,52,17,"And the Chaldeans broke the pillars of bronze that were in the temple of Yahweh, and the kettle stands and the sea of bronze that were in the temple of Yahweh, and they carried all their bronze to Babylon."
Jeremiah,52,18,"And they took with them the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the sprinkling bowls, and the pans, and all the vessels of bronze which were used in temple service."
Jeremiah,52,19,"And the captain of the guard took the bowls, and the firepans, and the sprinkling bowls, and the pots, and the lampstands, and the pans, and the libation bowls, those made of solid gold and those made of solid silver."
Jeremiah,52,20,"The two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve bronze oxen that were under the kettle stands which King Solomon had made for the temple of Yahweh—there was not a weight for the bronze of all these vessels!"
Jeremiah,52,21,"Now the pillars, the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits, and a thread of twelve cubits surrounded it, and its thickness was four fingers, hollowed out."
Jeremiah,52,22,"And a capital upon it was bronze and the height of the one capital was five cubits, and latticework and pomegranates were on the capital on all sides, all of bronze. And like these was the second pillar with pomegranates."
Jeremiah,52,23,And there were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; all the pomegranates on the latticework on all sides were a hundred.
Jeremiah,52,24,"Then the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and three keepers of the threshold."
Jeremiah,52,25,"And from the city he took one high official who was chief officer over the soldiers, and seven men of the king’s advisors who were found in the city, and the secretary of the commander of the army who levied for military service the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the midst of the city."
Jeremiah,52,26,Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
Jeremiah,52,27,And the king of Babylon struck them down and killed them at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah left from its land.
Jeremiah,52,28,"This is the number of the people whom Nebuchadnezzar deported: in the seventh year, three thousand twenty-three Judeans;"
Jeremiah,52,29,"in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, eight hundred and thirty-two persons from Jerusalem;"
Jeremiah,52,30,"in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, deported seven hundred and forty-five Judean persons; there were four thousand six hundred persons in all."
Jeremiah,52,31,"And then in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin, the king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth day of the month, Evil-merodach, the king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin, the king of Judah, and brought him out from prison."
Jeremiah,52,32,Then he spoke with him kindly and gave his seat above the seats of the kings who were with him in Babylon.
Jeremiah,52,33,So he changed the garments of his imprisonment and he ate food before him continually all the days of his life.
Jeremiah,52,34,"And his allowance, a continual allowance was given to him by the king of Babylon on a daily basis all the days of his life up to the day of his death."
