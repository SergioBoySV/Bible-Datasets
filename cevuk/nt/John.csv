John,1,1,In the beginning was the one who is called the Word. The Word was with God and was truly God.
John,1,2,From the very beginning the Word was with God.
John,1,3,"And with this Word, God created all things. Nothing was made without the Word. Everything that was created"
John,1,4,"received its life from him, and his life gave light to everyone."
John,1,5,"The light keeps shining in the dark, and darkness has never put it out."
John,1,6,"God sent a man named John,"
John,1,7,who came to tell about the light and to lead all people to have faith.
John,1,8,John wasn't that light. He came only to tell about the light.
John,1,9,The true light that shines on everyone was coming into the world.
John,1,10,"The Word was in the world, but no one knew him, though God had made the world with his Word."
John,1,11,"He came into his own world, but his own nation did not welcome him."
John,1,12,Yet some people accepted him and put their faith in him. So he gave them the right to be the children of God.
John,1,13,They were not God's children by nature or because of any human desires. God himself was the one who made them his children.
John,1,14,"The Word became a human being and lived here with us. We saw his true glory, the glory of the only Son of the Father. From him all the kindness and all the truth of God have come down to us."
John,1,15,"John spoke about him and shouted, “This is the one I told you would come! He is greater than I am, because he was alive before I was born.”"
John,1,16,"Because of all that the Son is, we have been given one blessing after another."
John,1,17,"The Law was given by Moses, but Jesus Christ brought us undeserved kindness and truth."
John,1,18,"No one has ever seen God. The only Son, who is truly God and is closest to the Father, has shown us what God is like."
John,2,1,"Three days later Mary, the mother of Jesus, was at a wedding feast in the village of Cana in Galilee."
John,2,2,Jesus and his disciples had also been invited and were there.
John,2,3,"When the wine was all gone, Mary said to Jesus, “They don't have any more wine.”"
John,2,4,"Jesus replied, “Mother, my time hasn't yet come! You must not tell me what to do.”"
John,2,5,"Mary then said to the servants, “Do whatever Jesus tells you to do.”"
John,2,6,At the feast there were six stone water jars that were used by the people for washing themselves in the way that their religion said they must. Each jar held about a hundred litres.
John,2,7,"Jesus told the servants to fill them to the top with water. Then after the jars had been filled,"
John,2,8,"he said, “Now take some water and give it to the man in charge of the feast.” The servants did as Jesus told them,"
John,2,9,"and the man in charge drank some of the water that had now turned into wine. He did not know where the wine had come from, but the servants did. He called the bridegroom over"
John,2,10,"and said, “The best wine is always served first. Then after the guests have had plenty, the other wine is served. But you have kept the best until last!”"
John,2,11,"This was Jesus' first miracle, and he did it in the village of Cana in Galilee. There Jesus showed his glory, and his disciples put their faith in him."
John,2,12,"After this, he went with his mother, his brothers, and his disciples to the town of Capernaum, where they stayed for a few days."
John,2,13,"Not long before the Jewish festival of Passover, Jesus went to Jerusalem."
John,2,14,"There he found people selling cattle, sheep, and doves in the temple. He also saw moneychangers sitting at their tables."
John,2,15,"So he took some rope and made a whip. Then he chased everyone out of the temple, together with their sheep and cattle. He turned over the tables of the moneychangers and scattered their coins."
John,2,16,"Jesus said to the people who had been selling doves, “Get those doves out of here! Don't make my Father's house a market place.”"
John,2,17,"The disciples then remembered that the Scriptures say, “My love for your house burns in me like a fire.”"
John,2,18,"The Jewish leaders asked Jesus, “What miracle will you perform to show us why you have done this?”"
John,2,19,"“Destroy this temple,” Jesus answered, “and in three days I will build it again!”"
John,2,20,"The leaders replied, “It took forty-six years to build this temple. What makes you think you can rebuild it in three days?”"
John,2,21,But Jesus was talking about his body as a temple.
John,2,22,"And when he was raised from death, his disciples remembered what he had told them. Then they believed the Scriptures and the words of Jesus."
John,2,23,"In Jerusalem during Passover many people put their faith in Jesus, because they saw him perform miracles."
John,2,24,"But Jesus knew what was in their hearts, and he would not let them have power over him."
John,2,25,No one had to tell him what people were like. He already knew.
John,3,1,There was a man named Nicodemus who was a Pharisee and a Jewish leader.
John,3,2,"One night he went to Jesus and said, “Sir, we know that God has sent you to teach us. You could not perform these miracles, unless God were with you.”"
John,3,3,"Jesus replied, “I tell you for certain that you must be born from above before you can see God's kingdom!”"
John,3,4,"Nicodemus asked, “How can a grown man ever be born a second time?”"
John,3,5,"Jesus answered: I tell you for certain that before you can get into God's kingdom, you must be born not only by water, but by the Spirit."
John,3,6,Humans give life to their children. Yet only God's Spirit can change you into a child of God.
John,3,7,Don't be surprised when I say that you must be born from above.
John,3,8,"Only God's Spirit gives new life. The Spirit is like the wind that blows wherever it wants to. You can hear the wind, but you don't know where it comes from or where it is going."
John,3,9,“How can this be?” Nicodemus asked.
John,3,10,Jesus replied: How can you be a teacher of Israel and not know these things?
John,3,11,I tell you for certain that we know what we are talking about because we have seen it ourselves. But none of you will accept what we say.
John,3,12,"If you don't believe when I talk to you about things on earth, how can you possibly believe if I talk to you about things in heaven?"
John,3,13,"No one has gone up to heaven except the Son of Man, who came down from there."
John,3,14,"And the Son of Man must be lifted up, just as that metal snake was lifted up by Moses in the desert."
John,3,15,Then everyone who has faith in the Son of Man will have eternal life.
John,3,16,"God loved the people of this world so much that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who has faith in him will have eternal life and never really die."
John,3,17,God did not send his Son into the world to condemn its people. He sent him to save them!
John,3,18,No one who has faith in God's Son will be condemned. But everyone who doesn't have faith in him has already been condemned for not having faith in God's only Son.
John,3,19,"The light has come into the world, and people who do evil things are judged guilty because they love the dark more than the light."
John,3,20,"People who do evil hate the light and won't come to the light, because it clearly shows what they have done."
John,3,21,"But everyone who lives by the truth will come to the light, because they want others to know that God is really the one doing what they do."
John,3,22,"Later, Jesus and his disciples went to Judea, where he stayed with them for a while and was baptizing people."
John,4,1,Jesus knew that the Pharisees had heard that he was winning and baptizing more followers than John was.
John,4,2,"But Jesus' disciples were really the ones doing the baptizing, and not Jesus himself."
John,4,3,Jesus left Judea and started for Galilee again.
John,4,4,"This time he had to go through Samaria,"
John,4,5,and on his way he came to the town of Sychar. It was near the field that Jacob had long ago given to his son Joseph.
John,5,1,"Later, Jesus went to Jerusalem for another Jewish festival."
John,5,2,"In the city near the sheep gate was a pool with five porches, and its name in Hebrew was Bethzatha."
John,6,1,"Jesus crossed Lake Galilee, which was also known as Lake Tiberias."
John,6,2,"A large crowd had seen him perform miracles to heal the sick, and those people went with him."
John,7,1,Jesus decided to leave Judea and to start going through Galilee because the Jewish leaders wanted to kill him.
John,7,2,"It was almost time for the Festival of Shelters,"
John,7,3,"and Jesus' brothers said to him, “Why don't you go to Judea? Then your disciples can see what you are doing."
John,7,4,"No one does anything in secret, if they want others to know about them. So let the world know what you are doing!”"
John,7,5,Even Jesus' own brothers had not yet become his followers.
John,7,6,"Jesus answered, “My time hasn't yet come, but your time is always here."
John,7,7,"The people of this world cannot hate you. They hate me, because I tell them that they do evil things."
John,7,8,"Go on to the festival. My time hasn't yet come, and I am not going.”"
John,7,9,Jesus said this and stayed on in Galilee.
John,7,10,"After Jesus' brothers had gone to the festival, he went secretly, without telling anyone."
John,7,11,"During the festival the Jewish leaders looked for Jesus and asked, “Where is he?”"
John,7,12,"The crowds even got into an argument about him. Some were saying, “Jesus is a good man,” while others were saying, “He is lying to everyone.”"
John,7,13,"But the people were afraid of their leaders, and none of them talked in public about him."
John,7,14,"When the festival was about half over, Jesus went into the temple and started teaching."
John,7,15,"The leaders were surprised and said, “How does this man know so much? He has never been taught!”"
John,7,16,Jesus replied: I am not teaching something that I thought up. What I teach comes from the one who sent me.
John,7,17,"If you really want to obey God, you will know if what I teach comes from God or from me."
John,7,18,"If I wanted to bring honour to myself, I would speak for myself. But I want to honour the one who sent me. That is why I tell the truth and not a lie."
John,7,19,Didn't Moses give you the Law? Yet none of you obey it! So why do you want to kill me?
John,7,20,"The crowd replied, “You're mad! What makes you think someone wants to kill you?”"
John,7,21,"Jesus answered: I performed one miracle, and it amazed you."
John,7,22,"Moses commanded you to circumcise your sons. But it wasn't really Moses who gave you this command. It was your ancestors, and even on the Sabbath you circumcise your sons"
John,7,23,in order to obey the Law of Moses. Why are you angry with me for making someone completely well on the Sabbath?
John,7,24,Don't judge by appearances. Judge by what is right.
John,7,25,"Some of the people from Jerusalem were saying, “Isn't this the man they want to kill?"
John,7,26,"Yet here he is, speaking for everyone to hear. And no one is arguing with him. Do you suppose the authorities know that he is the Messiah?"
John,7,27,"But how could that be? No one knows where the Messiah will come from, but we know where this man comes from.”"
John,7,28,"As Jesus was teaching in the temple, he shouted, “Do you really think you know me and where I came from? I didn't come on my own! The one who sent me is truthful, and you don't know him."
John,7,29,"But I know the one who sent me, because I came from him.”"
John,7,30,"Some of the people wanted to arrest Jesus there and then. But no one even laid a hand on him, because his time had not yet come."
John,7,31,"A lot of people in the crowd put their faith in him and said, “When the Messiah comes, he won't perform more miracles than this man has done!”"
John,7,32,"When the Pharisees heard the crowd arguing about Jesus, they got together with the chief priests and sent some temple police to arrest him."
John,7,33,"But Jesus told them, “I will be with you a little while longer, and then I will return to the one who sent me."
John,7,34,"You will look for me, but you won't find me. You cannot go where I am going.”"
John,7,35,"The Jewish leaders asked each other, “Where can he go to keep us from finding him? Is he going to some foreign country where our people live? Is he going there to teach the Greeks?"
John,7,36,"What did he mean by saying that we will look for him, but won't find him? Why can't we go where he is going?”"
John,7,37,"On the last and most important day of the festival, Jesus stood up and shouted, “If you are thirsty, come to me and drink!"
John,7,38,"Have faith in me, and you will have life-giving water flowing from deep inside you, just as the Scriptures say.”"
John,7,39,"Jesus was talking about the Holy Spirit, who would be given to everyone that had faith in him. The Spirit had not yet been given to anyone, since Jesus had not yet been given his full glory."
John,7,40,"When the crowd heard Jesus say this, some of them said, “He must be the Prophet!”"
John,7,41,"Others said, “He is the Messiah!” Others even said, “Can the Messiah come from Galilee?"
John,7,42,The Scriptures say that the Messiah will come from the family of King David. Doesn't this mean that he will be born in David's home town of Bethlehem?”
John,7,43,The people started taking sides against each other because of Jesus.
John,7,44,"Some of them wanted to arrest him, but no one laid a hand on him."
John,7,45,"When the temple police returned to the chief priests and Pharisees, they were asked, “Why didn't you bring Jesus here?”"
John,7,46,"They answered, “No one has ever spoken like that man!”"
John,7,47,"The Pharisees said to them, “Have you also been fooled?"
John,7,48,Not one of the chief priests or the Pharisees has faith in him.
John,7,49,And these people who don't know the Law are under God's curse anyway.”
John,7,50,"Nicodemus was there at the time. He was a member of the council, and was the same one who had earlier come to see Jesus. He said,"
John,7,51,“Our Law doesn't let us condemn people before we hear what they have to say. We cannot judge them before we know what they have done.”
John,7,52,"Then they said, “Nicodemus, you must be from Galilee! Read the Scriptures, and you will find that no prophet is to come from Galilee.”"
John,7,53,"Everyone else went home,"
John,8,1,but Jesus walked out to the Mount of Olives.
John,8,2,"Then early the next morning he went to the temple. The people came to him, and he sat down and started teaching them."
John,8,3,The Pharisees and the teachers of the Law of Moses brought in a woman who had been caught in bed with a man who wasn't her husband. They made her stand in the middle of the crowd.
John,8,4,"Then they said, “Teacher, this woman was caught sleeping with a man who isn't her husband."
John,8,5,The Law of Moses teaches that a woman like this should be stoned to death! What do you say?”
John,8,6,"They asked Jesus this question, because they wanted to test him and bring some charge against him. But Jesus simply bent over and started writing on the ground with his finger."
John,8,7,"They kept on asking Jesus about the woman. Finally, he stood up and said, “If any of you have never sinned, then go ahead and throw the first stone at her!”"
John,8,8,Once again he bent over and began writing on the ground.
John,8,9,"The people left one by one, beginning with the oldest. Finally, Jesus and the woman were there alone."
John,8,10,"Jesus stood up and asked her, “Where is everyone? Isn't there anyone left to accuse you?”"
John,8,11,"“No sir,” the woman answered. Then Jesus told her, “I am not going to accuse you either. You may go now, but don't sin any more.”"
John,8,12,"Once again Jesus spoke to the people. This time he said, “I am the light for the world! Follow me, and you won't be walking in the dark. You will have the light that gives life.”"
John,8,13,"The Pharisees objected, “You are the only one speaking for yourself, and what you say isn't true!”"
John,8,14,"Jesus replied: Even if I do speak for myself, what I say is true! I know where I came from and where I am going. But you don't know where I am from or where I am going."
John,8,15,"You judge in the same way that everyone else does, but I don't judge anyone."
John,8,16,"If I did judge, I would judge fairly, because I would not be doing it alone. The Father who sent me is here with me."
John,8,17,Your Law requires two witnesses to prove that something is true.
John,8,18,"I am one of my witnesses, and the Father who sent me is the other one."
John,8,19,"“Where is your Father?” they asked. “You don't know me or my Father!” Jesus answered. “If you knew me, you would know my Father.”"
John,8,20,"Jesus said this while he was still teaching in the place where the temple treasures were stored. But no one arrested him, because his time had not yet come."
John,8,21,"Jesus also told them, “I am going away, and you will look for me. But you cannot go where I am going, and you will die with your sins unforgiven.”"
John,8,22,"The Jewish leaders asked, “Does he intend to kill himself? Is that what he means by saying we cannot go where he is going?”"
John,8,23,"Jesus answered, “You are from below, but I am from above. You belong to this world, but I don't."
John,8,24,"That is why I said you will die with your sins unforgiven. If you don't have faith in me for who I am, you will die, and your sins will not be forgiven.”"
John,8,25,"“Who are you?” they asked Jesus. Jesus answered, “I am exactly who I told you at the beginning."
John,8,26,"There is a lot more I could say to condemn you. But the one who sent me is truthful, and I tell the people of this world only what I have heard from him.”"
John,8,27,No one understood that Jesus was talking to them about the Father.
John,8,28,"Jesus went on to say, “When you have lifted up the Son of Man, you will know who I am. You will also know that I don't do anything on my own. I say only what my Father taught me."
John,8,29,"The one who sent me is with me. I always do what pleases him, and he will never leave me.”"
John,8,30,"After Jesus said this, many of the people put their faith in him."
John,8,31,"Jesus told the people who had faith in him, “If you keep on obeying what I have said, you truly are my disciples."
John,8,32,"You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”"
John,8,33,"They answered, “We are Abraham's children! We have never been anyone's slaves. How can you say we will be set free?”"
John,8,34,Jesus replied: I tell you for certain that anyone who sins is a slave of sin!
John,8,35,"And slaves don't stay in the family for ever, though the Son will always remain in the family."
John,8,36,"If the Son gives you freedom, you are free!"
John,8,37,"I know that you are from Abraham's family. Yet you want to kill me, because my message isn't really in your hearts."
John,8,38,"I am telling you what my Father has shown me, just as you are doing what your father has taught you."
John,8,39,"The people said to Jesus, “Abraham is our father!” Jesus replied, “If you were Abraham's children, you would do what Abraham did."
John,8,40,"Instead, you want to kill me for telling you the truth that God gave me. Abraham never did anything like that."
John,8,41,"But you are doing exactly what your father does.” “Don't accuse us of having someone else as our father!” they said. “We just have one father, and he is God.”"
John,8,42,"Jesus answered: If God were your Father, you would love me, because I came from God and only from him. He sent me. I did not come on my own."
John,8,43,Why can't you understand what I am talking about? Can't you stand to hear what I am saying?
John,8,44,"Your father is the devil, and you do exactly what he wants. He has always been a murderer and a liar. There is nothing truthful about him. He speaks on his own, and everything he says is a lie. Not only is he a liar himself, but he is also the father of all lies."
John,8,45,"Everything I have told you is true, and you still refuse to have faith in me."
John,8,46,"Can any of you accuse me of sin? If you cannot, why won't you have faith in me? After all, I am telling you the truth."
John,8,47,"Anyone who belongs to God will listen to his message. But you refuse to listen, because you don't belong to God."
John,8,48,"The people told Jesus, “We were right to say that you are a Samaritan and that you have a demon in you!”"
John,8,49,"Jesus answered, “I don't have a demon in me. I honour my Father, and you refuse to honour me."
John,8,50,"I don't want honour for myself. But there is one who wants me to be honoured, and he is also the one who judges."
John,8,51,"I tell you for certain that if you obey my words, you will never die.”"
John,8,52,"Then the people said, “Now we are sure that you have a demon. Abraham is dead, and so are the prophets. How can you say that no one who obeys your words will ever die?"
John,8,53,"Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you think you are?”"
John,8,54,"Jesus replied, “If I honoured myself, it would mean nothing. My Father is the one who honours me. You claim that he is your God,"
John,8,55,"even though you don't really know him. If I said I didn't know him, I would be a liar, just like all of you. But I know him, and I do what he says."
John,8,56,Your father Abraham was really glad to see me.”
John,8,57,“You are not even fifty years old!” they said. “How could you have seen Abraham?”
John,8,58,"Jesus answered, “I tell you for certain that even before Abraham was, I was, and I am.”"
John,8,59,"The people picked up stones to kill Jesus, but he hid and left the temple."
John,9,1,"As Jesus walked along, he saw a man who had been blind since birth."
John,9,2,"Jesus' disciples asked, “Teacher, why was this man born blind? Was it because he or his parents sinned?”"
John,9,3,"“No, it wasn't!” Jesus answered. “But because of his blindness, you will see God perform a miracle for him."
John,9,4,"As long as it is day, we must do what the one who sent me wants me to do. When night comes, no one can work."
John,9,5,"While I am in the world, I am the light for the world.”"
John,9,6,"After Jesus said this, he spat on the ground. He made some mud and smeared it on the man's eyes."
John,9,7,"Then he said, “Go and wash off the mud in Siloam Pool.” The man went and washed in Siloam, which means “One who is sent”. When he had washed off the mud, he could see."
John,9,8,The man's neighbours and the people who had seen him begging wondered if he really could be the same man.
John,9,9,"Some of them said he was the same beggar, while others said he only looked like him. But he told them, “I am that man.”"
John,9,10,“Then how can you see?” they asked.
John,9,11,"He answered, “Someone named Jesus made some mud and smeared it on my eyes. He told me to go and wash it off in Siloam Pool. When I did, I could see.”"
John,9,12,"“Where is he now?” they asked. “I don't know,” he answered."
John,10,1,Jesus said: I tell you for certain that only thieves and robbers climb over the fence instead of going in through the gate to the sheep pen.
John,12,1,"Six days before Passover Jesus went back to Bethany, where he had raised Lazarus from death."
John,12,2,"A meal had been prepared for Jesus. Martha was doing the serving, and Lazarus himself was there."
John,12,3,"Mary took a very expensive bottle of perfume and poured it on Jesus' feet. She wiped them with her hair, and the sweet smell of the perfume filled the house."
John,12,4,"A disciple named Judas Iscariot was there. He was the one who was going to betray Jesus, and he asked,"
John,12,5,“Why wasn't this perfume sold for three hundred silver coins and the money given to the poor?”
John,12,6,Judas did not really care about the poor. He asked this because he carried the money bag and sometimes would steal from it.
John,12,7,"Jesus replied, “Leave her alone! She has kept this perfume for the day of my burial."
John,12,8,"You will always have the poor with you, but you won't always have me.”"
John,12,9,"A lot of people came when they heard that Jesus was there. They also wanted to see Lazarus, because Jesus had raised him from death."
John,12,10,So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus.
John,12,11,He was the reason that many of the Jewish people were turning from them and putting their faith in Jesus.
John,12,12,"The next day a large crowd was in Jerusalem for Passover. When they heard that Jesus was coming for the festival,"
John,12,13,"they took palm branches and went out to greet him. They shouted, “Hooray! God bless the one who comes in the name of the Lord! God bless the King of Israel!”"
John,12,14,"Jesus found a donkey and rode on it, just as the Scriptures say,"
John,12,15,"“People of Jerusalem, don't be afraid! Your King is now coming, and he is riding on a donkey.”"
John,12,16,"At first, Jesus' disciples did not understand. But after he had been given his glory, they remembered all this. Everything had happened exactly as the Scriptures said it would."
John,13,1,"It was before Passover, and Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave this world and to return to the Father. He had always loved his followers in this world, and he loved them to the very end."
John,13,2,"Even before the evening meal started, the devil had made Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, decide to betray Jesus."
John,13,3,Jesus knew that he had come from God and would go back to God. He also knew that the Father had given him complete power.
John,13,4,"So during the meal Jesus got up, removed his outer garment, and wrapped a towel around his waist."
John,13,5,He put some water into a large bowl. Then he began washing his disciples' feet and drying them with the towel he was wearing.
John,13,6,"But when he came to Simon Peter, that disciple asked, “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?”"
John,13,7,"Jesus answered, “You don't really know what I am doing, but later you will understand.”"
John,13,8,"“You will never wash my feet!” Peter replied. “If I don't wash you,” Jesus told him, “you don't really belong to me.”"
John,13,9,"Peter said, “Lord, don't wash just my feet. Wash my hands and my head.”"
John,13,10,"Jesus answered, “People who have bathed and are clean all over need to wash just their feet. And you, my disciples, are clean, except for one of you.”"
John,13,11,"Jesus knew who would betray him. That is why he said, “except for one of you.”"
John,13,12,"After Jesus had washed his disciples' feet and had put his outer garment back on, he sat down again. Then he said: Do you understand what I have done?"
John,13,13,"You call me your teacher and Lord, and you should, because that is who I am."
John,13,14,"And if your Lord and teacher has washed your feet, you should do the same for each other."
John,13,15,"I have set the example, and you should do for each other exactly what I have done for you."
John,13,16,"I tell you for certain that servants are not greater than their master, and messengers are not greater than the one who sent them."
John,13,17,"You know these things, and God will bless you, if you do them."
John,13,18,"I am not talking about all of you. I know the ones I have chosen. But what the Scriptures say must come true. And they say, “The man who ate with me has turned against me!”"
John,13,19,"I am telling you this before it all happens. Then when it does happen, you will believe who I am."
John,13,20,"I tell you for certain that anyone who welcomes my messengers also welcomes me, and anyone who welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me."
John,13,21,"After Jesus had said these things, he was deeply troubled and told his disciples, “I tell you for certain that one of you will betray me.”"
John,13,22,They were confused about what he meant. And they just stared at each other.
John,13,23,"Jesus' favourite disciple was sitting next to him at the meal,"
John,13,24,and Simon motioned for that disciple to find out which one Jesus meant.
John,13,25,"So the disciple leaned towards Jesus and asked, “Lord, which one of us are you talking about?”"
John,13,26,"Jesus answered, “I will dip this piece of bread in the sauce and give it to the one I was talking about.” Then Jesus dipped the bread and gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot."
John,13,27,"At once Satan took control of Judas. Jesus said, “Judas, go quickly and do what you have to do.”"
John,13,28,No one at the meal understood what Jesus meant.
John,13,29,"But because Judas was in charge of the money, some of them thought that Jesus had told him to buy something they needed for the festival. Others thought that Jesus had told him to give some money to the poor."
John,13,30,Judas took the piece of bread and went out. It was already night.
John,13,31,"After Judas had gone, Jesus said: Now the Son of Man will be given glory, and he will bring glory to God."
John,13,32,"Then, after God is given glory because of him, God will bring glory to him, and God will do it very soon."
John,13,33,"My children, I will be with you for a little while longer. Then you will look for me, but you won't find me. I tell you just as I told the people, “You cannot go where I am going.”"
John,13,34,"But I am giving you a new command. You must love each other, just as I have loved you."
John,13,35,"If you love each other, everyone will know that you are my disciples."
John,13,36,"Simon Peter asked, “Lord, where are you going?” Jesus answered, “You can't go with me now, but later on you will.”"
John,13,37,"Peter asked, “Lord, why can't I go with you now? I would die for you!”"
John,13,38,"“Would you really die for me?” Jesus asked. “I tell you for certain that before a cock crows, you will say three times that you don't even know me.”"
John,14,1,"Jesus said to his disciples, “Don't be worried! Have faith in God and have faith in me."
John,14,2,"There are many rooms in my Father's house. I wouldn't tell you this, unless it was true. I am going there to prepare a place for each of you."
John,14,3,"After I have done this, I will come back and take you with me. Then we will be together."
John,14,4,You know the way to where I am going.”
John,14,5,"Thomas said, “Lord, we don't even know where you are going! How can we know the way?”"
John,14,6,"“I am the way, the truth, and the life!” Jesus answered. “Without me, no one can go to the Father."
John,14,7,"If you had known me, you would have known the Father. But from now on, you do know him, and you have seen him.”"
John,14,8,"Philip said, “Lord, show us the Father. That is all we need.”"
John,14,9,"Jesus replied: Philip, I have been with you for a long time. Don't you know who I am? If you have seen me, you have seen the Father. How can you ask me to show you the Father?"
John,14,10,Don't you believe that I am one with the Father and that the Father is one with me? What I say isn't said on my own. The Father who lives in me does these things.
John,14,11,Have faith in me when I say that the Father is one with me and that I am one with the Father. Or else have faith in me simply because of the things I do.
John,14,12,"I tell you for certain that if you have faith in me, you will do the same things that I am doing. You will do even greater things, now that I am going back to the Father."
John,14,13,"Ask me, and I will do whatever you ask. This way the Son will bring honour to the Father."
John,14,14,I will do whatever you ask me to do.
John,14,15,"Jesus said to his disciples: If you love me, you will do as I command."
John,14,16,Then I will ask the Father to send you the Holy Spirit who will help you and always be with you.
John,14,17,"The Spirit will show you what is true. The people of this world cannot accept the Spirit, because they don't see or know him. But you know the Spirit, who is with you and will keep on living in you."
John,14,18,I won't leave you like orphans. I will come back to you.
John,14,19,"In a little while the people of this world won't be able to see me, but you will see me. And because I live, you will live."
John,14,20,"Then you will know that I am one with the Father. You will know that you are one with me, and I am one with you."
John,14,21,"If you love me, you will do what I have said, and my Father will love you. I will also love you and show you what I am like."
John,14,22,"The other Judas, not Judas Iscariot, then spoke up and asked, “Lord, what do you mean by saying that you will show us what you are like, but you will not show the people of this world?”"
John,14,23,"Jesus replied: If anyone loves me, they will obey me. Then my Father will love them, and we will come to them and live in them."
John,14,24,"But anyone who doesn't love me, won't obey me. What they have heard me say doesn't really come from me, but from the Father who sent me."
John,14,25,I have told you these things while I am still with you.
John,14,26,"But the Holy Spirit will come and help you, because the Father will send the Spirit to take my place. The Spirit will teach you everything and will remind you of what I said while I was with you."
John,14,27,"I give you peace, the kind of peace that only I can give. It isn't like the peace that this world can give. So don't be worried or afraid."
John,14,28,"You have already heard me say that I am going and that I will also come back to you. If you really love me, you should be glad that I am going back to the Father, because he is greater than I am."
John,14,29,"I am telling you this before I leave, so that when it does happen, you will have faith in me."
John,14,30,"I cannot speak with you much longer, because the ruler of this world is coming. But he has no power over me."
John,14,31,"I obey my Father, so that everyone in the world might know that I love him. It is time for us to go now."
John,15,1,"Jesus said to his disciples: I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener."
John,15,2,"He cuts away every branch of mine that doesn't produce fruit. But he trims clean every branch that does produce fruit, so that it will produce even more fruit."
John,15,3,You are already clean because of what I have said to you.
John,15,4,"Stay joined to me, and I will stay joined to you. Just as a branch cannot produce fruit unless it stays joined to the vine, you cannot produce fruit unless you stay joined to me."
John,15,5,"I am the vine, and you are the branches. If you stay joined to me, and I stay joined to you, then you will produce lots of fruit. But you cannot do anything without me."
John,15,6,"If you don't stay joined to me, you will be thrown away. You will be like dry branches that are gathered up and burnt in a fire."
John,15,7,"Stay joined to me and let my teachings become part of you. Then you can pray for whatever you want, and your prayer will be answered."
John,15,8,"When you become fruitful disciples of mine, my Father will be honoured."
John,15,9,"I have loved you, just as my Father has loved me. So remain faithful to my love for you."
John,15,10,"If you obey me, I will keep loving you, just as my Father keeps loving me, because I have obeyed him."
John,15,11,I have told you this to make you as completely happy as I am.
John,15,12,"Now I tell you to love each other, as I have loved you."
John,15,13,The greatest way to show love for friends is to die for them.
John,15,14,"And you are my friends, if you obey me."
John,15,15,"Servants don't know what their master is doing, and so I don't speak to you as my servants. I speak to you as my friends, and I have told you everything that my Father has told me."
John,15,16,"You did not choose me. I chose you and sent you out to produce fruit, the kind of fruit that will last. Then my Father will give you whatever you ask for in my name."
John,15,17,So I command you to love each other.
John,15,18,"If the people of this world hate you, just remember that they hated me first."
John,15,19,"If you belonged to the world, its people would love you. But you don't belong to the world. I have chosen you to leave the world behind, and that is why its people hate you."
John,15,20,"Remember how I told you that servants are not greater than their master. So if people ill-treat me, they will ill-treat you. If they do what I say, they will do what you say."
John,15,21,"People will do to you exactly what they did to me. They will do it because you belong to me, and they don't know the one who sent me."
John,15,22,"If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin. But now they have no excuse for their sin."
John,15,23,Everyone who hates me also hates my Father.
John,15,24,"I have done things that no one else has ever done. If they had not seen me do these things, they would not be guilty. But they did see me do these things, and they still hate me and my Father too."
John,15,25,"That is why the Scriptures are true when they say, “People hated me for no reason.”"
John,15,26,I will send you the Spirit who comes from the Father and shows what is true. The Spirit will help you and will tell you about me.
John,15,27,"Then you will also tell others about me, because you have been with me from the beginning."
John,16,1,I am telling you this to keep you from being afraid.
John,16,2,You will be chased out of the Jewish meeting places. And the time will come when people will kill you and think they are doing God a favour.
John,16,3,They will do these things because they don't know either the Father or me.
John,16,4,"I am saying this to you now, so that when the time comes, you will remember what I have said. I was with you at the first, and so I didn't tell you these things."
John,16,5,"But now I am going back to the Father who sent me, and none of you asks me where I am going."
John,16,6,You are very sad from hearing all this.
John,16,7,"But I tell you that I am going to do what is best for you. That is why I am going away. The Holy Spirit cannot come to help you until I leave. But after I am gone, I will send the Spirit to you."
John,16,8,The Spirit will come and show the people of this world the truth about sin and God's justice and the judgment.
John,16,9,"The Spirit will show them that they are wrong about sin, because they didn't have faith in me."
John,16,10,"They are wrong about God's justice, because I am going to the Father, and you won't see me again."
John,16,11,"And they are wrong about the judgment, because God has already judged the ruler of this world."
John,16,12,"I have much more to say to you, but right now it would be more than you could understand."
John,16,13,"The Spirit shows what is true and will come and guide you into the full truth. The Spirit doesn't speak on his own. He will tell you only what he has heard from me, and he will let you know what is going to happen."
John,16,14,The Spirit will bring glory to me by taking my message and telling it to you.
John,16,15,Everything that the Father has is mine. That is why I have said that the Spirit takes my message and tells it to you.
John,16,16,"Jesus told his disciples, “For a little while you won't see me, but after a while you will see me.”"
John,16,17,"They said to each other, “What does Jesus mean by saying that for a little while we won't see him, but after a while we will see him? What does he mean by saying that he is going to the Father?"
John,16,18,What is this ‘little while’ that he is talking about? We don't know what he means.”
John,16,19,"Jesus knew that they had some questions, so he said: You are wondering what I meant when I said that for a little while you won't see me, but after a while you will see me."
John,16,20,"I tell you for certain that you will cry and be sad, but the world will be happy. You will be sad, but later you will be happy."
John,16,21,"When a woman is about to give birth, she is in great pain. But after it is all over, she forgets the pain and is happy, because she has brought a child into the world."
John,16,22,"You are now very sad. But later I will see you, and you will be so happy that no one will be able to change the way you feel."
John,16,23,"When that time comes, you won't have to ask me about anything. I tell you for certain that the Father will give you whatever you ask for in my name."
John,16,24,"You have not asked for anything in this way before, but now you must ask in my name. Then it will be given to you, so that you will be completely happy."
John,16,25,I have used examples to explain to you what I have been talking about. But the time will come when I will speak to you plainly about the Father and will no longer use examples like these.
John,16,26,"You will ask the Father in my name, and I won't have to ask him for you."
John,16,27,"God the Father loves you because you love me, and you believe that I have come from him."
John,16,28,"I came from the Father into the world, but I am leaving the world and returning to the Father."
John,16,29,"The disciples said, “Now you are speaking plainly to us! You are not using examples."
John,16,30,"At last we know that you understand everything, and we don't have any more questions. Now we believe that you truly have come from God.”"
John,16,31,Jesus replied: Do you really believe me?
John,16,32,"The time will come and is already here when all of you will be scattered. Each of you will go back home and leave me by myself. But the Father will be with me, and I won't be alone."
John,16,33,"I have told you this, so that you might have peace in your hearts because of me. While you are in the world, you will have to suffer. But cheer up! I have defeated the world."
John,17,1,"After Jesus had finished speaking to his disciples, he looked up towards heaven and prayed: Father, the time has come for you to bring glory to your Son, in order that he may bring glory to you."
John,17,2,"And you gave him power over all people, so that he would give eternal life to everyone you give him."
John,17,3,"Eternal life is to know you, the only true God, and to know Jesus Christ, the one you sent."
John,17,4,I have brought glory to you here on earth by doing everything you gave me to do.
John,17,5,"Now, Father, give me back the glory that I had with you before the world was created."
John,17,6,"You have given me some followers from this world, and I have shown them what you are like. They were yours, but you gave them to me, and they have obeyed you."
John,17,7,They know that you gave me everything I have.
John,17,8,"I told my followers what you told me, and they accepted it. They know that I came from you, and they believe that you are the one who sent me."
John,17,9,"I am praying for them, but not for those who belong to this world. My followers belong to you, and I am praying for them."
John,17,10,"All that I have is yours, and all that you have is mine, and they will bring glory to me."
John,17,11,"Holy Father, I am no longer in the world. I am coming to you, but my followers are still in the world. So keep them safe by the power of the name that you have given me. Then they will be one with each other, just as you and I are one."
John,17,12,"While I was with them, I kept them safe by the power you have given me. I guarded them, and not one of them was lost, except the one who had to be lost. This happened so that what the Scriptures say would come true."
John,17,13,"I am on my way to you. But I say these things while I am still in the world, so that my followers will have the same complete joy that I do."
John,17,14,"I have told them your message. But the people of this world hate them, because they don't belong to this world, just as I don't."
John,17,15,"Father, I don't ask you to take my followers out of the world, but keep them safe from the evil one."
John,17,16,"They don't belong to this world, and neither do I."
John,17,17,Your word is the truth. So let this truth make them completely yours.
John,17,18,"I am sending them into the world, just as you sent me."
John,17,19,"I have given myself completely for their sake, so that they may belong completely to the truth."
John,17,20,I am not praying just for these followers. I am also praying for everyone else who will have faith because of what my followers will say about me.
John,17,21,"I want all of them to be one with each other, just as I am one with you and you are one with me. I also want them to be one with us. Then the people of this world will believe that you sent me."
John,17,22,"I have honoured my followers in the same way that you honoured me, in order that they may be one with each other, just as we are one."
John,17,23,"I am one with them, and you are one with me, so that they may become completely one. Then this world's people will know that you sent me. They will know that you love my followers as much as you love me."
John,17,24,"Father, I want everyone you have given me to be with me, wherever I am. Then they will see the glory that you have given me, because you loved me before the world was created."
John,17,25,"Good Father, the people of this world don't know you. But I know you, and my followers know that you sent me."
John,17,26,"I told them what you are like, and I will tell them even more. Then the love that you have for me will become part of them, and I will be one with them."
John,18,1,"When Jesus had finished praying, he and his disciples crossed the Kidron Valley and went into a garden."
John,18,2,"Jesus had often met there with his disciples, and Judas knew where the place was."
John,19,1,Pilate gave orders for Jesus to be beaten with a whip.
John,19,2,The soldiers made a crown out of thorn branches and put it on Jesus. Then they put a purple robe on him.
John,19,3,"They came up to him and said, “Hey, you king of the Jews!” They also hit him with their fists."
John,19,4,"Once again Pilate went out. This time he said, “I will have Jesus brought out to you again. Then you can see for yourselves that I have not found him guilty.”"
John,19,5,"Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said, “Here is the man!”"
John,19,6,"When the chief priests and the temple police saw him, they yelled, “Nail him to a cross! Nail him to a cross!” Pilate told them, “You take him and nail him to a cross! I don't find him guilty of anything.”"
John,19,7,"The crowd replied, “He claimed to be the Son of God! Our Jewish Law says that he must be put to death.”"
John,19,8,"When Pilate heard this, he was terrified."
John,19,9,"He went back inside and asked Jesus, “Where are you from?” But Jesus did not answer."
John,19,10,“Why won't you answer my question?” Pilate asked. “Don't you know that I have the power to let you go free or to nail you to a cross?”
John,19,11,"Jesus replied, “If God had not given you the power, you couldn't do anything at all to me. But the one who handed me over to you did something even worse.”"
John,19,12,"Then Pilate wanted to set Jesus free. But the crowd again yelled, “If you set this man free, you are no friend of the Emperor! Anyone who claims to be a king is an enemy of the Emperor.”"
John,19,13,"When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out. Then he sat down on the judge's bench at the place known as “The Stone Pavement”. In Aramaic this pavement is called “Gabbatha”."
John,19,14,"It was about midday on the day before Passover, and Pilate said to the crowd, “Look at your king!”"
John,19,15,"“Kill him! Kill him!” they yelled. “Nail him to a cross!” “So you want me to nail your king to a cross?” Pilate asked. The chief priests replied, “The Emperor is our king!”"
John,19,16,"Then Pilate handed Jesus over to be nailed to a cross. Jesus was taken away,"
John,19,17,and he carried his cross to a place known as “The Skull”. In Aramaic this place is called “Golgotha”.
John,19,18,"There Jesus was nailed to the cross, and on each side of him a man was also nailed to a cross."
John,19,19,"Pilate ordered the charge against Jesus to be written on a board and put above the cross. It read, “Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.”"
John,19,20,"The words were written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek. The place where Jesus was taken wasn't far from the city, and many of the Jewish people read the charge against him."
John,19,21,"So the chief priests went to Pilate and said, “Why did you write that he is King of the Jews? You should have written, ‘He claimed to be King of the Jews.’ ”"
John,19,22,"But Pilate told them, “What is written will not be changed!”"
John,19,23,"After the soldiers had nailed Jesus to the cross, they divided up his clothes into four parts, one for each of them. But his outer garment was made from a single piece of cloth, and it did not have any seams."
John,19,24,"The soldiers said to each other, “Let's not rip it apart. We will gamble to see who gets it.” This happened so that the Scriptures would come true, which say, “They divided up my clothes and gambled for my garments.” The soldiers then did what they had decided."
John,19,25,Jesus' mother stood beside his cross with her sister and Mary the wife of Clopas. Mary Magdalene was standing there too.
John,19,26,"When Jesus saw his mother and his favourite disciple with her, he said to his mother, “This man is now your son.”"
John,19,27,"Then he said to the disciple, “She is now your mother.” From then on, that disciple took her into his own home."
John,19,28,"Jesus knew that he had now finished his work. And in order to make the Scriptures come true, he said, “I am thirsty!”"
John,19,29,A jar of cheap wine was there. Someone then soaked a sponge with the wine and held it up to Jesus' mouth on the stem of a hyssop plant.
John,19,30,"After Jesus drank the wine, he said, “Everything is done!” He bowed his head and died."
John,19,31,"The next day would be both a Sabbath and the Passover. It was a special day for the Jewish people, and they did not want the bodies to stay on the crosses during that day. So they asked Pilate to break the men's legs and take their bodies down."
John,19,32,The soldiers first broke the legs of the other two men who were nailed there.
John,19,33,"But when they came to Jesus, they saw that he was already dead, and they did not break his legs."
John,19,34,"One of the soldiers stuck his spear into Jesus' side, and blood and water came out."
John,19,35,"We know this is true, because it was told by someone who saw it happen. Now you can have faith too."
John,19,36,"All this happened so that the Scriptures would come true, which say, “No bone of his body will be broken”"
John,19,37,"and, “They will see the one in whose side they stuck a spear.”"
John,19,38,"Joseph from Arimathea was one of Jesus' disciples. He had kept it secret though, because he was afraid of the Jewish leaders. But now he asked Pilate to let him have Jesus' body. Pilate gave him permission, and Joseph took it down from the cross."
John,19,39,Nicodemus also came with about thirty kilogrammes of spices made from myrrh and aloes. This was the same Nicodemus who had visited Jesus one night.
John,19,40,"The two men wrapped the body in a linen cloth, together with the spices, which was how the Jewish people buried their dead."
John,19,41,"In the place where Jesus had been nailed to a cross, there was a garden with a tomb that had never been used."
John,19,42,"The tomb was nearby, and since it was the time to prepare for the Sabbath, they were in a hurry to put Jesus' body there."
John,20,1,"On Sunday morning while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been rolled away from the entrance."
John,20,2,"She ran to Simon Peter and to Jesus' favourite disciple and said, “They have taken the Lord from the tomb! We don't know where they have put him.”"
John,20,3,Peter and the other disciple set off for the tomb.
John,20,4,"They ran side by side, until the other disciple ran faster than Peter and got there first."
John,20,5,"He bent over and saw the strips of linen cloth lying inside the tomb, but he did not go in."
John,20,6,"When Simon Peter got there, he went into the tomb and saw the strips of cloth."
John,20,7,He also saw the piece of cloth that had been used to cover Jesus' face. It was rolled up and in a place by itself.
John,20,8,"The disciple who got there first then went into the tomb, and when he saw it, he believed."
John,20,9,At that time Peter and the other disciple did not know that the Scriptures said Jesus would rise to life.
John,20,10,So the two of them went back to the other disciples.
John,20,11,"Mary Magdalene stood crying outside the tomb. She was still weeping, when she stooped down"
John,20,12,and saw two angels inside. They were dressed in white and were sitting where Jesus' body had been. One was at the head and the other was at the foot.
John,20,13,"The angels asked Mary, “Why are you crying?” She answered, “They have taken away my Lord's body! I don't know where they have put him.”"
John,20,14,"As soon as Mary said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there. But she did not know who he was."
John,20,15,"Jesus asked her, “Why are you crying? Who are you looking for?” She thought he was the gardener and said, “Sir, if you have taken his body away, please tell me, so I can go and get him.”"
John,20,16,"Then Jesus said to her, “Mary!” She turned and said to him, “Rabboni.” The Aramaic word “Rabboni” means “Teacher”."
John,20,17,"Jesus told her, “Don't hold on to me! I have not yet gone to the Father. But tell my disciples that I am going to the one who is my Father and my God, as well as your Father and your God.”"
John,20,18,Mary Magdalene then went and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord. She also told them what he had said to her.
John,20,19,"The disciples were afraid of the Jewish leaders, and on the evening of that same Sunday they locked themselves in a room. Suddenly, Jesus appeared in the middle of the group. He greeted them"
John,20,20,"and showed them his hands and his side. When the disciples saw the Lord, they became very happy."
John,20,21,"After Jesus had greeted them again, he said, “I am sending you, just as the Father has sent me.”"
John,20,22,"Then he breathed on them and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit."
John,20,23,"If you forgive anyone's sins, they will be forgiven. But if you don't forgive their sins, they will not be forgiven.”"
John,20,24,"Although Thomas the Twin was one of the twelve disciples, he wasn't with the others when Jesus appeared to them."
John,20,25,"So they told him, “We have seen the Lord!” But Thomas said, “First, I must see the nail scars in his hands and touch them with my finger. I must put my hand where the spear went into his side. I won't believe unless I do this!”"
John,20,26,"A week later the disciples were together again. This time, Thomas was with them. Jesus came in while the doors were still locked and stood in the middle of the group. He greeted his disciples"
John,20,27,"and said to Thomas, “Put your finger here and look at my hands! Put your hand into my side. Stop doubting and have faith!”"
John,20,28,"Thomas replied, “You are my Lord and my God!”"
John,20,29,"Jesus said, “Thomas, do you have faith because you have seen me? The people who have faith in me without seeing me are the ones who are really blessed!”"
John,20,30,"Jesus performed many other miracles for his disciples, and not all of them are written in this book."
John,20,31,"But these are written so that you will put your faith in Jesus as the Messiah and the Son of God. If you have faith in him, you will have true life."
John,21,1,Jesus later appeared to his disciples along the shore of Lake Tiberias.
John,21,2,"Simon Peter, Thomas the Twin, Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, and the brothers James and John, were there, together with two other disciples."
John,21,3,"Simon Peter said, “I'm going fishing!” The others said, “We will go with you.” They went out in their boat. But they didn't catch a thing that night."
John,21,4,"Early the next morning Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not realize who he was."
John,21,5,"Jesus shouted, “Friends, have you caught anything?” “No!” they answered."
John,21,6,"So he told them, “Let your net down on the right side of your boat, and you will catch some fish.” They did, and the net was so full of fish that they could not drag it up into the boat."
John,21,7,"Jesus' favourite disciple told Peter, “It's the Lord!” When Simon heard that it was the Lord, he put on the clothes that he had taken off while he was working. Then he jumped into the water."
John,21,8,The boat was only about a hundred metres from shore. So the other disciples stayed in the boat and dragged in the net full of fish.
John,21,9,"When the disciples got out of the boat, they saw some bread and a charcoal fire with fish on it."
John,21,10,"Jesus told his disciples, “Bring some of the fish you have just caught.”"
John,21,11,"Simon Peter got back into the boat and dragged the net to shore. In it were one hundred and fifty-three large fish, but still the net did not rip."
John,21,12,"Jesus said, “Come and eat!” But none of the disciples dared ask who he was. They knew he was the Lord."
John,21,13,Jesus took the bread in his hands and gave some of it to his disciples. He did the same with the fish.
John,21,14,This was the third time that Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from death.
John,21,15,"When Jesus and his disciples had finished eating, he asked, “Simon son of John, do you love me more than the others do?” Simon Peter answered, “Yes, Lord, you know I do!” “Then feed my lambs,” Jesus said."
John,21,16,"Jesus asked a second time, “Simon son of John, do you love me?” Peter answered, “Yes, Lord, you know I love you!” “Then take care of my sheep,” Jesus told him."
John,21,17,"Jesus asked a third time, “Simon son of John, do you love me?” Peter was hurt because Jesus had asked him three times if he loved him. So he told Jesus, “Lord, you know everything. You know I love you.” Jesus replied, “Feed my sheep."
John,21,18,"I tell you for certain that when you were a young man, you dressed yourself and went wherever you wanted to go. But when you are old, you will hold out your hands. Then others will tie your belt around you and lead you where you don't want to go.”"
John,21,19,"Jesus said this to tell how Peter would die and bring honour to God. Then he said to Peter, “Follow me!”"
John,21,20,"Peter turned and saw Jesus' favourite disciple following them. He was the same one who had sat next to Jesus at the meal and had asked, “Lord, who is going to betray you?”"
John,21,21,"When Peter saw that disciple, he asked Jesus, “Lord, what about him?”"
John,21,22,"Jesus answered, “What is it to you, if I want him to live until I return? You must follow me.”"
John,21,23,"So the rumour spread among the other disciples that this disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say he would not die. He simply said, “What is it to you, if I want him to live until I return?”"
John,21,24,"This disciple is the one who told all this. He wrote it, and we know he is telling the truth."
John,21,25,"Jesus did many other things. If they were all written in books, I don't suppose there would be room enough in the whole world for all the books."
