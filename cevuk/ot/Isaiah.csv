Isaiah,1,1,"I am Isaiah, the son of Amoz. And this is the message that I was given about Judah and Jerusalem when Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah were the kings of Judah:"
Isaiah,1,2,"The LORD has said, “Listen, heaven and earth! The children I raised have turned against me."
Isaiah,1,3,"Oxen and donkeys know who owns and feeds them, but my people won't ever learn.”"
Isaiah,1,4,"Israel, you are a sinful nation loaded down with guilt. You are wicked and corrupt and have turned from the LORD, the holy God of Israel."
Isaiah,1,5,"Why be punished more? Why not give up your sin? Your head is badly bruised, and you are weak all over."
Isaiah,1,6,"From your head to your toes there isn't a healthy spot. Bruises, cuts, and open sores go without care or oil to ease the pain."
Isaiah,1,7,Your country lies in ruins; your towns are in ashes. Foreigners and strangers take and destroy your land while you watch.
Isaiah,1,8,"Enemies surround Jerusalem, alone like a hut in a vineyard or in a cucumber field."
Isaiah,1,9,"Zion would have disappeared like Sodom and Gomorrah, if the LORD All-Powerful had not let a few of its people survive."
Isaiah,1,10,You are no better than the leaders and people of Sodom and Gomorrah! So listen to the LORD God:
Isaiah,1,11,“Your sacrifices mean nothing to me. I am sick of your offerings of rams and choice cattle; I don't like the blood of bulls or lambs or goats.
Isaiah,1,12,“Who asked you to bring all this when you come to worship me? Stay out of my temple!
Isaiah,1,13,"Your sacrifices are worthless, and incense is disgusting. I can't stand the evil you do on your New Moon Festivals or on your Sabbaths and other times of worship."
Isaiah,1,14,I hate your New Moon Festivals and all others as well. They are a heavy burden I am tired of carrying.
Isaiah,1,15,"“No matter how much you pray, I won't listen. You are too violent."
Isaiah,1,16,Wash yourselves clean! I am disgusted with your filthy deeds. Stop doing wrong
Isaiah,1,17,and learn to live right. See that justice is done. Defend widows and orphans and help those in need.”
Isaiah,1,18,"I, the LORD , invite you to come and talk it over. Your sins are scarlet red, but they will be whiter than snow or wool."
Isaiah,1,19,"If you willingly obey me, the best crops in the land will be yours."
Isaiah,1,20,"But if you turn against me, your enemies will kill you. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Isaiah,1,21,"Jerusalem, you are like an unfaithful wife. Once your judges were honest and your people lived right; now you are a city full of murderers."
Isaiah,1,22,"Your silver is fake, and your wine is watered down."
Isaiah,1,23,Your leaders have rejected me to become friends of crooks; your rulers are looking for gifts and bribes. Widows and orphans never get a fair trial.
Isaiah,1,24,"I am the LORD All-Powerful, the mighty ruler of Israel, and I make you a promise: you are now my enemy, and I will show my anger by taking revenge on you."
Isaiah,1,25,I will punish you terribly and burn away everything that makes you unfit to worship me.
Isaiah,1,26,"Jerusalem, I will choose judges and advisers like those you had before. Your new name will be “Justice and Faithfulness”."
Isaiah,1,27,"Jerusalem, you will be saved by showing justice; Zion's people who turn to me will be saved by doing right."
Isaiah,1,28,"But those rebellious sinners who turn against me, the LORD, will all disappear."
Isaiah,1,29,You will be made ashamed of those groves of trees where you worshipped idols.
Isaiah,1,30,You will be like a grove of trees dying in a drought.
Isaiah,1,31,"Your strongest leaders will be like dry wood set on fire by their idols. No one will be able to help, as they all go up in flames."
Isaiah,2,1,This is the message that I was given about Judah and Jerusalem:
Isaiah,2,2,"In the future, the mountain with the LORD 's temple will be the highest of all. It will reach above the hills; every nation will rush to it."
Isaiah,2,3,"Many people will come and say, “Let's go to the mountain of the LORD God of Jacob and worship in his temple.” The LORD will teach us his Law from Jerusalem, and we will obey him."
Isaiah,2,4,He will settle arguments between nations. They will beat their swords and their spears into rakes and shovels; they will never make war or attack one another.
Isaiah,2,5,"People of Israel, let's live by the light of the LORD."
Isaiah,2,6,"Our LORD , you have deserted your people, Israel, because they follow customs of nations from the east. They worship Philistine gods and are close friends of foreigners."
Isaiah,2,7,They have endless treasures of silver and gold; they have countless horses and war chariots.
Isaiah,2,8,Everywhere in the country they worship the idols they have made.
Isaiah,2,9,"And so, all of them will be ashamed and disgraced. Don't help them!"
Isaiah,2,10,"Every one of you, hide among the rocks and in the ground, because the LORD is fearsome, marvellous, and glorious."
Isaiah,2,11,"When the LORD comes, everyone who is proud will be made humble, and the LORD alone will be honoured."
Isaiah,2,12,The LORD All-Powerful has chosen a day when those who are proud and conceited will be put down.
Isaiah,2,13,"The tall and towering cedars of Lebanon will be destroyed. So will the oak trees of Bashan,"
Isaiah,2,14,"all high mountains and hills,"
Isaiah,2,15,"every strong fortress,"
Isaiah,2,16,"all the seagoing ships, and every beautiful boat."
Isaiah,2,17,"When that day comes, everyone who is proud will be put down. Only the LORD will be honoured."
Isaiah,2,18,Idols will be gone for good.
Isaiah,2,19,"You had better hide in caves and holes— the LORD will be fearsome, marvellous, and glorious when he comes to terrify people on earth."
Isaiah,2,20,On that day everyone will throw to the rats and bats their idols of silver and gold they made to worship.
Isaiah,2,21,"The LORD will be fearsome, marvellous, and glorious when he comes to terrify people on earth— they will hide in caves and in the hills."
Isaiah,2,22,"Stop trusting the power of humans. They are all going to die, so how can they help?"
Isaiah,3,1,"The mighty LORD All-Powerful is going to take away from Jerusalem and Judah everything you need— your bread and water,"
Isaiah,4,1,"When this happens, seven women will grab the same man, and each of them will say, “I'll buy my own food and clothes! Just marry me and take away my disgrace.”"
Isaiah,4,2,"The time is coming when the LORD will make his land fruitful and glorious again, and the people of Israel who survive will take great pride in what the land produces."
Isaiah,4,3,"Everyone who is left alive in Jerusalem will be called special,"
Isaiah,4,4,after the LORD sends a fiery judgment to clean the city and its people of their violent deeds.
Isaiah,4,5,Then the LORD will cover the whole city and its meeting places with a thick cloud each day and with a flaming fire each night. God's own glory will be like a huge tent that covers everything.
Isaiah,4,6,It will provide shade from the heat of the sun and a place of shelter and protection from storms and rain.
Isaiah,5,1,I will sing a song about my friend's vineyard that was on the side of a fertile hill.
Isaiah,5,2,"My friend dug the ground, removed the stones, and planted the best vines. He built a watchtower and dug a pit in rocky ground for pressing the grapes. He hoped they would be sweet, but bitter grapes were all it produced."
Isaiah,5,3,"Listen, people of Jerusalem and of Judah! You be the judge of me and my vineyard."
Isaiah,5,4,"What more could I have done for my vineyard? I hoped for sweet grapes, but bitter grapes were all that grew."
Isaiah,5,5,Now I will let you know what I am going to do. I will cut down the hedge and tear down the wall. My vineyard will be trampled and left in ruins.
Isaiah,5,6,"It will turn into a desert, neither pruned nor hoed; it will be covered with thorns and briars. I will command the clouds not to send rain."
Isaiah,5,7,"I am the LORD All-Powerful! Israel is the vineyard, and Judah is the garden I tended with care. I had hoped for honesty and for justice, but dishonesty and cries for mercy were all I found."
Isaiah,5,8,"You are in for trouble! You take over house after house and field after field, until there is no room left for anyone else in all the land."
Isaiah,5,9,"But the LORD All-Powerful has made this promise to me: Those large and beautiful homes will be left empty, with no one to take care of them."
Isaiah,5,10,"Four hectares of grapevines will produce only twenty-seven litres of juice, and a hundred and eighty litres of seed will produce merely eighteen litres of grain."
Isaiah,5,11,"You are in for trouble! You get up early to start drinking, and you keep it up late into the night."
Isaiah,5,12,"At your drinking parties you have the music of stringed instruments, tambourines, and flutes. But you never even think about all the LORD has done,"
Isaiah,5,13,"and so his people know nothing about him. That's why many of you will be dragged off to foreign lands. Your leaders will starve to death, and everyone else will suffer from thirst."
Isaiah,5,14,"The world of the dead has opened its mouth wide and is eagerly waiting for the leaders of Jerusalem and for its noisy crowds, especially for those who take pride in that city."
Isaiah,5,15,"Its citizens have been put down, and its proud people have been brought to shame."
Isaiah,5,16,"But the holy LORD God All-Powerful is praised, because he has shown who he is by bringing justice."
Isaiah,5,17,"His people will be like sheep grazing in their own pasture, and they will take off what was left by others."
Isaiah,5,18,You are in for trouble! The lies you tell are like ropes by which you drag along sin and evil.
Isaiah,5,19,"And you say, “Let the holy God of Israel hurry up and do what he has promised, so we can see it for ourselves.”"
Isaiah,5,20,"You are headed for trouble! You say wrong is right, darkness is light, and bitter is sweet."
Isaiah,5,21,You think you are clever and wise.
Isaiah,5,22,And you are great at drinking and mixing drinks. But you are in for trouble.
Isaiah,5,23,"You accept bribes to let the guilty go free, and you cheat the innocent out of a fair trial."
Isaiah,5,24,"You will go up in flames like straw and hay! You have rejected the teaching of the holy LORD God All-Powerful of Israel. Now your roots will rot, and your blossoms will turn to dust."
Isaiah,5,25,"You are the LORD 's people, but you made him terribly angry, and he struck you with his mighty arm. Mountains shook, and dead bodies covered the streets like rubbish. The LORD is still angry, and he is ready to strike you again."
Isaiah,5,26,"The LORD has signalled for the foreign nations to come and attack you. He has already whistled, and they are coming as fast as they can."
Isaiah,5,27,"None of them are tired. They don't sleep or get drowsy, and they run without stumbling. Their belts don't come loose; their sandal straps don't break."
Isaiah,5,28,"Their arrows are sharp, and their bows are ready. The hoofs of their horses are hard as flint; the wheels of their war chariots turn as fast as a whirlwind."
Isaiah,5,29,They roar and growl like fierce young lions as they grab their victims and drag them off where no one can rescue them.
Isaiah,5,30,"On the day they attack, they will roar like the sea. And across the land you will see nothing but darkness and trouble, because the light of day will be covered by thick clouds."
Isaiah,6,1,"In the year that King Uzziah died, I had a vision of the LORD . He was on his throne high above, and his robe filled the temple."
Isaiah,6,2,"Flaming creatures with six wings each were flying over him. They covered their faces with two of their wings and their bodies with two more. They used the other two wings for flying,"
Isaiah,6,3,"as they shouted, “Holy, holy, holy, LORD All-Powerful! The earth is filled with your glory.”"
Isaiah,6,4,"As they shouted, the doorposts of the temple shook, and the temple was filled with smoke."
Isaiah,6,5,"Then I cried out, “I'm doomed! Everything I say is sinful, and so are the words of everyone around me. Yet I have seen the King, the LORD All-Powerful.”"
Isaiah,6,6,One of the flaming creatures flew over to me with a burning coal that it had taken from the altar with a pair of metal tongs.
Isaiah,6,7,"It touched my lips with the hot coal and said, “This has touched your lips. Your sins are forgiven, and you are no longer guilty.”"
Isaiah,6,8,"After this, I heard the LORD ask, “Is there anyone I can send? Will someone go for us?” “I'll go,” I answered. “Send me!”"
Isaiah,6,9,"Then the LORD told me to go and speak this message to the people: “You will listen and listen, but never understand. You will look and look, but never see.” The LORD also said,"
Isaiah,6,10,"“Make these people stubborn! Make them stop up their ears, cover their eyes, and fail to understand. Don't let them turn to me and be healed.”"
Isaiah,6,11,"Then I asked the LORD , “How long will this last?” The LORD answered: Until their towns are destroyed and their houses are deserted, until their fields are empty,"
Isaiah,6,12,"and I have sent them far away, leaving their land in ruins."
Isaiah,6,13,"If only a tenth of the people are left, even they will be destroyed. But just as stumps remain after trees have been cut down, some of my chosen ones will be left."
Isaiah,7,1,"Ahaz, the son of Jotham and the grandson of Uzziah, was king of Judah when King Rezin of Syria and King Pekah son of Remaliah of Israel went to attack Jerusalem. But they were not able to do what they had planned."
Isaiah,7,2,"When news reached the royal palace that Syria had joined forces with Israel, King Ahaz and everyone in Judah were so terrified that they shook like trees in a storm."
Isaiah,7,3,Then the LORD said to me: Take your son Shearjashub and go and see King Ahaz. You will find him on the road near the cloth makers' shops at the end of the canal that brings water from the upper pool.
Isaiah,7,4,"Tell Ahaz to stop worrying. There's no need for him to be afraid of King Rezin and King Pekah. They are very angry, but they are nothing more than a dying fire. Ahaz doesn't need to fear"
Isaiah,7,5,their evil threats
Isaiah,7,6,to invade and defeat Judah and Jerusalem and to let the son of Tabeel be king in his place.
Isaiah,7,7,"I, the LORD , promise that this will never happen."
Isaiah,8,1,"The LORD said, “Isaiah, get something to write on. Then write in big clear letters the name, MAHER-SHALAL-HASH-BAZ."
Isaiah,8,2,I will tell Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberechiah to serve as witnesses to this.”
Isaiah,8,3,"Some time later, my wife and I had a son, and the LORD said, “Name him Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz."
Isaiah,8,4,"Because before he can say ‘Mummy’ or ‘Daddy’, the king of Assyria will attack and take everything of value from Damascus and Samaria.”"
Isaiah,8,5,The LORD spoke to me again and said:
Isaiah,8,6,These people have refused the gentle waters of Shiloah and have gladly gone over to the side of King Rezin and King Pekah.
Isaiah,8,7,"Now I will send the king of Assyria against them with his powerful army, which will attack like the mighty River Euphrates overflowing its banks."
Isaiah,8,8,Enemy soldiers will cover Judah like a flood reaching up to your neck. But God is with us. He will spread his wings and protect our land.
Isaiah,8,9,"All you foreign nations, go ahead and prepare for war, but you will be crushed."
Isaiah,8,10,"Get together and make plans, but you will fail because God is with us."
Isaiah,8,11,The LORD took hold of me with his powerful hand and said: I'm warning you! Don't act like these people.
Isaiah,8,12,"Don't call something a rebellious plot, just because they do, and don't be afraid of something, just because they are."
Isaiah,8,13,"I am the one you should fear and respect. I am the holy God, the LORD All-Powerful!"
Isaiah,9,1,But those who have suffered will no longer be in pain. The territories of Zebulun and Naphtali in Galilee were once hated. But this land of the Gentiles across the River Jordan and along the Mediterranean Sea will be greatly respected.
Isaiah,9,2,Those who walked in the dark have seen a bright light. And it shines upon everyone who lives in the land of darkest shadows.
Isaiah,9,3,"Our LORD , you have made your nation stronger. Because of you, its people are glad and celebrate like workers at harvest time or like soldiers dividing up what they have taken."
Isaiah,9,4,You have broken the power of those who abused and enslaved your people. You have rescued them just as you saved your people from Midian.
Isaiah,9,5,The boots of marching warriors and the blood-stained uniforms have been fed to flames and eaten by fire.
Isaiah,9,6,"A child has been born for us. We have been given a son who will be our ruler. His names will be Wonderful Adviser and Mighty God, Eternal Father and Prince of Peace."
Isaiah,9,7,His power will never end; peace will last for ever. He will rule David's kingdom and make it grow strong. He will always rule with honesty and justice. The LORD All-Powerful will make certain that all of this is done.
Isaiah,9,8,"The Lord had warned the people of Israel,"
Isaiah,9,9,"and all of them knew it, including everyone in the capital city of Samaria. But they were proud and stubborn and said,"
Isaiah,9,10,"“Houses of brick and sycamore have fallen to the ground, but we will build houses with stones and cedar.”"
Isaiah,9,11,The LORD made their enemies attack them.
Isaiah,9,12,"He sent the Arameans from the east and the Philistines from the west, and they swallowed up Israel. But even this did not stop him from being angry, so he kept on punishing them."
Isaiah,9,13,The people of Israel still did not turn back to the LORD All-Powerful and worship him.
Isaiah,9,14,"In one day he cut off their head and tail, their leaves and branches."
Isaiah,9,15,"Their rulers and leaders were the head, and the lying prophets were the tail."
Isaiah,9,16,"They had led the nation down the wrong path, and the people were confused."
Isaiah,9,17,"The Lord was angry with his people and kept punishing them, because they had turned against him. They were evil and spoke foolishly. That's why he did not have pity on their young people or on their widows and orphans."
Isaiah,9,18,Evil had spread like a raging forest fire sending thorn bushes up in smoke.
Isaiah,9,19,The LORD All-Powerful was angry and used the people as fuel for a fire that scorched the land. They turned against each other
Isaiah,9,20,"like wild animals attacking and eating everyone around them, even their own relatives. But still they were not satisfied."
Isaiah,9,21,"The tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh turned against each other, then joined forces to attack Judah. But the LORD was still angry and ready to punish the nation even more."
Isaiah,10,1,You people are in for trouble! You have made cruel and unfair laws
Isaiah,10,2,that let you cheat the poor and needy and rob widows and orphans.
Isaiah,10,3,But what will you do when you are fiercely attacked and punished by foreigners? Where will you run for help? Where will you hide your valuables?
Isaiah,10,4,"How will you escape being captured or killed? The Lord is still angry, and he isn't through with you yet!"
Isaiah,10,5,The Lord says: I am furious! And I will use the king of Assyria as a club
Isaiah,10,6,"to beat down you godless people. I am angry with you, and I will send him to attack you. He will take what he wants and walk on you like mud in the streets."
Isaiah,10,7,"He has even bigger plans in mind, because he wants to destroy many nations."
Isaiah,10,8,The king of Assyria says: My army commanders are kings!
Isaiah,10,9,"They have already captured the cities of Calno, Carchemish, Hamath, Arpad, Samaria, and Damascus."
Isaiah,11,1,"Like a branch that sprouts from a stump, someone from David's family will some day be king."
Isaiah,11,2,"The Spirit of the LORD will be with him to give him understanding, wisdom, and insight. He will be powerful, and he will know and honour the LORD."
Isaiah,11,3,His greatest joy will be to obey the LORD. This king won't judge by appearances or listen to rumours.
Isaiah,11,4,"The poor and the needy will be treated with fairness and with justice. His word will be law everywhere in the land, and criminals will be put to death."
Isaiah,11,5,Honesty and fairness will be his royal robes.
Isaiah,11,6,"Leopards will lie down with young goats, and wolves will rest with lambs. Calves and lions will eat together and be cared for by little children."
Isaiah,11,7,Cows and bears will share the same pasture; their young will rest side by side. Lions and oxen will both eat straw.
Isaiah,11,8,Little children will play near snake holes. They will stick their hands into dens of poisonous snakes and never be hurt.
Isaiah,11,9,"Nothing harmful will take place on the LORD 's holy mountain. Just as water fills the sea, the land will be filled with people who know and honour the LORD."
Isaiah,11,10,"The time is coming when one of David's descendants will be the signal for the people of all nations to come together. They will follow his advice, and his own nation will become famous."
Isaiah,11,11,"When that day comes, the Lord will again reach out his mighty arm and bring home his people who have survived in Assyria, Egypt, Pathros, Ethiopia, Elam, Shinar, Hamath, and the land along the coast."
Isaiah,11,12,"He will give a signal to the nations, and he will bring together the refugees from Judah and Israel, who have been scattered all over the earth."
Isaiah,11,13,"Israel will stop being jealous of Judah, and Judah will no longer be the enemy of Israel."
Isaiah,11,14,"Instead, they will get together and attack the Philistines in the west. Then they will defeat the Edomites, the Moabites, and the Ammonites in the east. They will rule those people and take from them whatever they want."
Isaiah,11,15,"The Lord will dry up the arm of the Red Sea near Egypt, and he will send a scorching wind to divide the River Euphrates into seven streams that anyone can step across."
Isaiah,11,16,"Then for his people who survive, there will be a good road from Assyria, just as there was a good road for their ancestors when they left Egypt."
Isaiah,12,1,"At that time you will say, “I thank you, LORD! You were angry with me, but you stopped being angry and gave me comfort."
Isaiah,12,2,"I trust you to save me, LORD God, and I won't be afraid. My power and my strength come from you, and you have saved me.”"
Isaiah,12,3,"With great joy, you people will get water from the well of victory."
Isaiah,12,4,"At that time you will say, “Our LORD , we are thankful, and we worship only you. We will tell the nations how glorious you are and what you have done."
Isaiah,12,5,Because of your wonderful deeds we will sing your praises everywhere on earth.”
Isaiah,12,6,"Sing, people of Zion! Celebrate the greatness of the holy LORD of Israel. God is here to help you."
Isaiah,13,1,This is the message that I was given about Babylon:
Isaiah,13,2,"From high on a barren hill give a signal, shout the orders, and point the way to enter the gates of Babylon's proud rulers."
Isaiah,13,3,The LORD has commanded his very best warriors and his proud heroes to show how angry he is.
Isaiah,13,4,Listen to the noisy crowds on the mountains! Kingdoms and nations are joining forces. The LORD All-Powerful is bringing together an army for battle.
Isaiah,13,5,From a distant land the LORD is coming fierce and furious— he brings his weapons to destroy the earth.
Isaiah,13,6,Cry and weep! The day is coming when the mighty LORD will bring destruction.
Isaiah,14,1,"The LORD will have mercy on Israel and will let them be his chosen people once again. He will bring them back to their own land, and foreigners will join them as part of Israel."
Isaiah,14,2,"Other nations will lead them home, and Israel will make slaves of them in the land that belongs to the Lord. Israel will rule over those who once governed and ill-treated them."
Isaiah,14,3,"The LORD will set you free from your sorrow, suffering, and slavery."
Isaiah,14,4,Then you will make fun of the king of Babylonia by singing this song: That cruel monster is done for! He won't attack us again.
Isaiah,14,5,"The LORD has crushed the power of those evil kings,"
Isaiah,14,6,who were furious and never stopped abusing the people of other nations.
Isaiah,14,7,Now all the world is at peace; its people are celebrating with joyful songs.
Isaiah,14,8,"King of Babylonia, even the cypress trees and the cedars of Lebanon celebrate and say, “Since you were put down, no one comes along to chop us down.”"
Isaiah,14,9,"The world of the dead eagerly waits for you. With great excitement, the spirits of ancient rulers hear about your coming."
Isaiah,14,10,"Each one of them will say, “Now you are just as weak as any of us!"
Isaiah,14,11,"Your pride and your music have ended here in the world of the dead. Worms are your blanket, maggots are your bed.”"
Isaiah,14,12,"You, the bright morning star, have fallen from the sky! You brought down other nations; now you are brought down."
Isaiah,14,13,"You said to yourself, “I'll climb to heaven and place my throne above the highest stars. I'll sit there with the gods far away in the north."
Isaiah,14,14,"I'll be above the clouds, just like God Most High.”"
Isaiah,14,15,But now you are deep in the world of the dead.
Isaiah,14,16,"Those who see you will stare and wonder, “Is this the man who made the world tremble and shook up kingdoms?"
Isaiah,14,17,Did he capture every city and make earth a desert? Is he the one who refused to let prisoners go home?”
Isaiah,14,18,"When kings die, they are buried in glorious tombs."
Isaiah,14,19,"But you will be left unburied, just another dead body lying underfoot like a broken branch. You will be one of many killed in battle and gone down to the deep rocky pit."
Isaiah,14,20,You won't be buried with kings; you ruined your country and murdered your people. You evil monster! We hope that your family will be forgotten for ever.
Isaiah,14,21,We will slaughter your sons to make them pay for the crimes of their ancestors. They won't take over the world or build cities anywhere on this earth.
Isaiah,14,22,"The LORD All-Powerful has promised to attack Babylonia and destroy everyone there, so that none of them will ever be remembered again."
Isaiah,14,23,"The LORD will sweep out the people, and the land will become a swamp for wild animals."
Isaiah,14,24,The LORD All-Powerful has made this promise: Everything I have planned will happen just as I said.
Isaiah,14,25,"I will wipe out every Assyrian in my country, and I will crush those on my mountains. I will free my people from slavery to the Assyrians."
Isaiah,14,26,"I have planned this for the whole world, and my mighty arm controls every nation."
Isaiah,14,27,"I, the LORD All-Powerful, have made these plans. No one can stop me now!"
Isaiah,14,28,This message came from the LORD in the year King Ahaz died:
Isaiah,14,29,"Philistines, don't be happy just because the rod that punished you is broken. That rod will become a poisonous snake, and then a flying fiery dragon."
Isaiah,14,30,"The poor and needy will find pastures for their sheep and will live in safety. But I will starve some of you, and others will be killed."
Isaiah,14,31,"Cry and weep in the gates of your towns, you Philistines! Smoke blows in from the north, and every soldier is ready."
Isaiah,14,32,"If a messenger comes from a distant nation, you must say: “The LORD built Zion. Even the poorest of his people will find safety there.”"
Isaiah,15,1,This is a message about Moab: The towns of Ar and Kir were destroyed in a night. Moab is left in ruins!
Isaiah,15,2,Everyone in Dibon has gone up to the temple and the shrines to cry and weep. All of Moab is crying. Heads and beards are shaved because of what happened at Nebo and Medeba.
Isaiah,15,3,"In the towns and at home, everyone wears sackcloth and cries loud and long."
Isaiah,15,4,"From Heshbon and Elealeh, weeping is heard in Jahaz; Moab's warriors scream while trembling with fear."
Isaiah,15,5,I pity Moab! Its people are running to Zoar and to Eglath-Shelishiyah. They cry on their way up to the town of Luhith; on the road to Horonaim they tell of disasters.
Isaiah,15,6,The streams of Nimrim and the grasslands have dried up. Every plant is parched.
Isaiah,15,7,"The people of Moab are leaving, crossing over Willow Brook, taking everything they own and have worked for."
Isaiah,15,8,In the towns of Eglaim and of Beerelim and everywhere else in Moab mournful cries are heard.
Isaiah,15,9,"The streams near Dimon are flowing with blood. But the Lord will bring even worse trouble to Dimon, because all in Moab who escape will be attacked by lions."
Isaiah,16,1,Send lambs as gifts to the ruler of the land. Send them across the desert from Sela to Mount Zion.
Isaiah,16,2,The women of Moab crossing the River Arnon are like a flock of birds scattered from their nests.
Isaiah,16,3,"Moab's messengers say to the people of Judah, “Be kind and help us! Shade us from the heat of the noonday sun. Hide our refugees! Don't turn them away."
Isaiah,16,4,"Let our people live in your country and find safety here.” Moab, your cruel enemies will disappear; they will no longer attack and destroy your land."
Isaiah,16,5,"Then a kingdom of love will be set up, and someone from David's family will rule with fairness. He will do what is right and quickly bring justice."
Isaiah,16,6,"We have heard of Moab's pride. Its people strut and boast, but without reason."
Isaiah,16,7,Tell everyone in Moab to mourn for their nation. Tell them to cry and weep for those fine raisins of Kir-Hareseth.
Isaiah,16,8,"Vineyards near Heshbon and Sibmah have turned brown. The rulers of nations used to get drunk on wine from those vineyards that spread to Jazer, then across the desert and beyond the sea."
Isaiah,16,9,Now I mourn like Jazer for the vineyards of Sibmah. I shed tears for Heshbon and for Elealeh. There will be no more harvest celebrations

Isaiah,30,8,"The LORD told me to write down his message for his people, so that it would be there for ever."
Isaiah,30,9,They have turned against the LORD and can't be trusted. They have refused his teaching
Isaiah,30,10,"and have said to his messengers and prophets: Don't tell us what God has shown you and don't preach the truth. Just say what we want to hear, even if it's false."
Isaiah,30,11,Stop telling us what God has said! We don't want to hear any more about the holy God of Israel.
Isaiah,30,12,"Now this is the answer of the holy God of Israel: “You rejected my message, and you trust in violence and lies."
Isaiah,30,13,This sin is like a crack that makes a high wall quickly crumble
Isaiah,30,14,and shatter like a crushed bowl. There's not a piece left big enough to carry hot coals or to scoop up water.”
Isaiah,30,15,"The holy LORD God of Israel had told all of you, “I will keep you safe if you turn back to me and calm down. I will make you strong if you quietly trust me.” Then you stubbornly"
Isaiah,30,16,"said, “No! We will safely escape on speedy horses.” But those who chase you will be even faster."
Isaiah,30,17,"As few as five of them, or even one, will be enough to chase a thousand of you. Finally, all that will be left will be a few survivors as lonely as a flag pole on a barren hill."
Isaiah,30,18,The LORD God is waiting to show how kind he is and to have pity on you. The LORD always does right; he blesses those who trust him.
Isaiah,30,19,"People of Jerusalem, you don't need to cry any more. The Lord is kind, and as soon as he hears your cries for help, he will come."
Isaiah,30,20,"The Lord has given you trouble and sorrow as your food and drink. But now you will again see the Lord, your teacher, and he will guide you."
Isaiah,30,21,"Whether you turn to the right or to the left, you will hear a voice saying, “This is the road! Now follow it.”"
Isaiah,30,22,Then you will treat your idols of silver and gold like rubbish; you will throw them away like filthy rags.
Isaiah,30,23,"The Lord will send rain to water the seeds you have planted—your fields will produce more crops than you need, and your cattle will graze in open pastures."
Isaiah,30,24,Even the oxen and donkeys that plough your fields will be fed the finest grain.
Isaiah,30,25,"On that day people will be slaughtered and towers destroyed, but streams of water will flow from high hills and towering mountains."
Isaiah,30,26,"Then the LORD will bandage his people's injuries and heal the wounds he has caused. The moon will shine as bright as the sun, and the sun will shine seven times brighter than usual. It will be like the light of seven days all at once."
Isaiah,30,27,The LORD is coming from far away with his fiery anger and thick clouds of smoke. His angry words flame up like a destructive fire;
Isaiah,30,28,he breathes out a flood that comes up to the neck. He sifts the nations and destroys them. Then he puts a bridle in every foreigner's mouth and leads them to doom.
Isaiah,30,29,"The LORD 's people will sing as they do when they celebrate a religious festival at night. The LORD is Israel's mighty rock, and his people will be as happy as they are when they follow the sound of flutes to the mountain where he is worshipped."
Isaiah,30,30,"The LORD will get furious. His fearsome voice will be heard, his arm will be seen ready to strike, and his anger will be like a destructive fire, followed by thunderstorms and hailstones."
Isaiah,30,31,"When the Assyrians hear the LORD 's voice and see him striking with his iron rod, they will be terrified."
Isaiah,30,32,"He will attack them in battle, and each time he strikes them, it will be to the music of tambourines and harps."
Isaiah,30,33,"Long ago the LORD got a place ready for burning the body of the dead king. The place for the fire is deep and wide, the wood is piled high, and the LORD will start the fire by breathing out flaming sulphur."
Isaiah,31,1,"You are in for trouble if you go to Egypt for help, or if you depend on an army of chariots or a powerful cavalry. Instead you should depend on and trust the holy LORD God of Israel."
Isaiah,31,2,"The LORD isn't stupid! He does what he promises, and he can bring doom. If you are cruel yourself, or help those who are evil, you will be destroyed."
Isaiah,31,3,"The Egyptians are mere humans. They aren't God. Their horses are made of flesh; they can't live for ever. When the LORD shows his power, he will destroy the Egyptians and all who depend on them. Together they will fall."
Isaiah,31,4,"The LORD All-Powerful said to me, “I will roar and attack like a fearless lion not frightened by the shouts of shepherds trying to protect their sheep. That's how I will come down and fight on Mount Zion."
Isaiah,31,5,"I, the LORD All-Powerful, will protect Jerusalem like a mother bird circling over her nest.”"
Isaiah,31,6,"People of Israel, come back! You have completely turned from the LORD."
Isaiah,31,7,"The time is coming when you will throw away your idols of silver and gold, made by your sinful hands."
Isaiah,31,8,"The Assyrians will be killed, but not by the swords of humans. Their young men will try to escape, but they will be captured and forced into slavery."
Isaiah,31,9,"Their fortress will fall when terror strikes; their army officers will be frightened and run from the battle. This is what the LORD has said, the LORD whose fiery furnace is built on Mount Zion."
Isaiah,32,1,A king and his leaders will rule with justice.
Isaiah,32,2,"They will be a place of safety from stormy winds, a stream in the desert, and a rock that gives shade from the heat of the sun."
Isaiah,32,3,"Then everyone who has eyes will open them and see, and those who have ears will pay attention."
Isaiah,32,4,All who are impatient will take time to think; everyone who stutters will talk clearly.
Isaiah,32,5,"Fools will no longer be highly respected, and crooks won't be given positions of honour."
Isaiah,32,6,"Fools talk foolishness. They always make plans to do sinful things, to lie about the LORD, to let the hungry starve, and to keep water from those who are thirsty."
Isaiah,32,7,"Cruel people tell lies— they do evil things, and make cruel plans to destroy the poor and needy, even when they beg for justice."
Isaiah,32,8,But helpful people can always be trusted to make helpful plans.
Isaiah,32,9,"Listen to what I say, you women who are carefree and careless!"
Isaiah,32,10,"You may not have worries now, but in about a year, the grape harvest will fail, and you will tremble."
Isaiah,32,11,"Shake and shudder, you women without a care! Strip off your clothes— put on sackcloth."
Isaiah,32,12,"Slap your breasts in sorrow because of what happened to the fruitful fields and vineyards,"
Isaiah,32,13,and to the happy homes in Jerusalem. The land of my people is covered with thorns.
Isaiah,32,14,"The palace will be deserted, the crowded city empty. Fortresses and towers will for ever become playgrounds for wild donkeys and pastures for sheep."
Isaiah,32,15,"When the Spirit is given to us from heaven, deserts will become orchards thick as fertile forests."
Isaiah,32,16,"Honesty and justice will prosper there,"
Isaiah,32,17,and justice will produce lasting peace and security.
Isaiah,32,18,"You, the LORD 's people, will live in peace, calm and secure,"
Isaiah,32,19,even if hailstones flatten forests and cities.
Isaiah,32,20,"You will have God's blessing, as you plant your crops beside streams, while your donkeys and cattle roam freely about."
Isaiah,33,1,"You defeated my people. Now you're in for trouble! You've never been destroyed, but you will be destroyed; you've never been betrayed, but you will be betrayed. When you have finished destroying and betraying, you will be destroyed and betrayed in return."
Isaiah,33,2,"Please, LORD , be kind to us! We depend on you. Make us strong each morning, and come to save us when we are in trouble."
Isaiah,33,3,Nations scatter when you roar and show your greatness.
Isaiah,33,4,We attack our enemies like swarms of locusts; we take everything that belongs to them.
Isaiah,33,5,"You, LORD , are above all others, and you live in the heavens. You have brought justice and fairness to Jerusalem;"
Isaiah,33,6,you are the foundation on which we stand today. You always save us and give true wisdom and knowledge. Nothing means more to us than obeying you.
Isaiah,33,7,"Listen! Our bravest soldiers are running through the streets, screaming for help. Our messengers hoped for peace, but came home crying."
Isaiah,33,8,"No one travels any more; every road is empty. Treaties are broken, and no respect is shown to any who keep promises."
Isaiah,33,9,Fields are dry and barren; Mount Lebanon wilts with shame. Sharon Valley is a desert; the forests of Bashan and Carmel have lost their leaves.
Isaiah,33,10,"But the LORD says, “Now I will do something and be greatly praised."
Isaiah,33,11,Your deeds are straw that will be set on fire by your very own breath.
Isaiah,33,12,You will be burnt to ashes like thorns in a fire.
Isaiah,33,13,"Everyone, both far and near, come, look at what I have done. See my mighty power!”"
Isaiah,33,14,"Those terrible sinners on Mount Zion tremble as they ask in fear, “How can we possibly live where a raging fire never stops burning?”"
Isaiah,33,15,"But there will be rewards for those who live right and tell the truth, for those who refuse to take money by force or accept bribes, for all who hate murder and violent crimes."
Isaiah,33,16,"They will live in a fortress high on a rocky cliff, where they will have food and plenty of water."
Isaiah,33,17,With your own eyes you will see the glorious King; you will see his kingdom reaching far and wide.
Isaiah,33,18,"Then you will ask yourself, “Where are those officials who terrified us and forced us to pay such heavy taxes?”"
Isaiah,33,19,You will never again have to see the proud people who spoke a strange and foreign language you could not understand.
Isaiah,33,20,"Look to Mount Zion where we celebrate our religious festivals. You will see Jerusalem, secure as a tent with pegs that cannot be pulled up and fastened with ropes that can never be broken."
Isaiah,33,21,Our wonderful LORD will be with us! There will be deep rivers and wide streams safe from enemy ships.
Isaiah,33,22,The LORD is our judge and our ruler; the LORD is our king and will keep us safe.
Isaiah,33,23,"But your nation is a ship with its rigging loose, its mast shaky, and its sail not spread. Some day even you who are lame will take everything you want from your enemies."
Isaiah,33,24,"The LORD will forgive your sins, and none of you will say, “I feel ill.”"
Isaiah,34,1,"Everyone of every nation, the entire earth, and all its creatures, come here and listen!"
Isaiah,34,2,The LORD is terribly angry with the nations; he has condemned them to be slaughtered.
Isaiah,34,3,Their dead bodies will be left to rot and stink; their blood will flow down the mountains.
Isaiah,34,4,Each star will disappear— the sky will roll up like a scroll. Everything in the sky will dry up and wilt like leaves on a vine or fruit on a tree.
Isaiah,34,5,"After the sword of the LORD has done what it wants to the skies above, it will come down on Edom, the nation that the LORD has doomed for destruction."
Isaiah,34,6,"The sword of the LORD is covered with blood from lambs and goats, together with fat from kidneys of rams. This is because the LORD will slaughter many people and make a sacrifice of them in the city of Bozrah and everywhere else in Edom."
Isaiah,34,7,"Edom's leaders are wild oxen. They are powerful bulls, but they will die with the others. Their country will be soaked with their blood, and its soil made fertile with their fat."
Isaiah,34,8,"The LORD has chosen the year and the day, when he will take revenge and come to Zion's defence."
Isaiah,34,9,Edom's streams will turn into tar and its soil into sulphur— then the whole country will go up in flames.
Isaiah,34,10,"It will burn night and day and never stop smoking. Edom will be a desert, generation after generation; no one will ever travel through that land."
Isaiah,34,11,"Owls, hawks, and wild animals will make it their home. God will leave it in ruins, merely a pile of rocks."
Isaiah,34,12,Edom will be called “Kingdom of Nothing”. Its rulers will also be nothing.
Isaiah,34,13,Its palaces and fortresses will be covered with thorns; only wolves and ostriches will make their home there.
Isaiah,34,14,"Wildcats and hyenas will hunt together, demons will scream to demons, and creatures of the night will live among the ruins."
Isaiah,34,15,"Owls will nest there to raise their young among its shadows, while families of vultures circle around."
Isaiah,34,16,"In The Book of the Lord you can search and find where it is written, “The LORD brought together all his creatures by the power of his Spirit. Not one is missing.”"
Isaiah,34,17,"The LORD has decided where they each should live; they will be there for ever, generation after generation."
Isaiah,35,1,Thirsty deserts will be glad; barren lands will celebrate and blossom with flowers.
Isaiah,35,2,"Deserts will bloom everywhere and sing joyful songs. They will be as majestic as Mount Lebanon, as glorious as Mount Carmel or Sharon Valley. Everyone will see the wonderful splendour of the LORD our God."
Isaiah,36,1,Hezekiah had been king of Judah for fourteen years when King Sennacherib of Assyria invaded the country and captured every walled city
Isaiah,36,2,except Jerusalem. The Assyrian king ordered his army commander to leave the city of Lachish and to take a large army to Jerusalem. The commander went there and stood on the road near the cloth makers' shops along the canal from the upper pool.
Isaiah,36,3,"Three of the king's highest officials came out of Jerusalem to meet him. One of them was Hilkiah's son Eliakim, who was the prime minister. The other two were Shebna, assistant to the prime minister, and Joah son of Asaph, keeper of the government records."
Isaiah,36,4,The Assyrian commander told them: I have a message for Hezekiah from the great king of Assyria. Ask Hezekiah why he feels so sure of himself.
Isaiah,36,5,"Does he think he can plan and win a war with nothing but words? Who is going to help him, now that he has turned against the king of Assyria?"
Isaiah,36,6,"Is he depending on Egypt and its king? That's the same as leaning on a broken stick, and it will go right through his hand."
Isaiah,36,7,"Is Hezekiah now depending on the LORD , your God? Didn't Hezekiah tear down all except one of the LORD 's altars and places of worship? Didn't he tell the people of Jerusalem and Judah to worship at that one place?"
Isaiah,36,8,"The king of Assyria wants to make a bet with you people! He will give you two thousand horses, if you have enough troops to ride them."
Isaiah,36,9,"How could you defeat even our lowest ranking officer, when you have to depend on Egypt for chariots and cavalry?"
Isaiah,36,10,Don't forget that it was the LORD who sent me here with orders to destroy your nation!
Isaiah,36,11,"Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said, “Sir, we don't want the people listening from the city wall to understand what you are saying. So please speak to us in Aramaic instead of Hebrew.”"
Isaiah,36,12,"The Assyrian army commander answered, “My king sent me to speak to everyone, not just to you leaders. These people will soon have to eat their own body waste and drink their own urine! And so will the three of you!”"
Isaiah,36,13,"Then, in a voice loud enough for everyone to hear, he shouted out in Hebrew: Listen to what the great king of Assyria says!"
Isaiah,36,14,Don't be fooled by Hezekiah. He can't save you.
Isaiah,36,15,Don't trust him when he tells you that the LORD will protect you from the king of Assyria.
Isaiah,36,16,"Stop listening to Hezekiah. Pay attention to my king. Surrender to him. He will let you keep your own vineyards, fig trees, and cisterns"
Isaiah,36,17,"for a while. Then he will come and take you away to a country just like yours, where you can plant vineyards and raise your own grain."
Isaiah,36,18,Hezekiah claims the LORD will save you. But don't be fooled by him. Were any other gods able to defend their land against the king of Assyria?
Isaiah,36,19,"What happened to the gods of Hamath, Arpad, and Sepharvaim? Were the gods of Samaria able to protect their land against the Assyrian forces?"
Isaiah,36,20,"None of these gods kept their people safe from the king of Assyria. Do you think the LORD , your God, can do any better?"
Isaiah,37,1,"As soon as Hezekiah heard the news, he tore off his clothes in sorrow and put on sackcloth. Then he went into the temple of the LORD."
Isaiah,37,2,"He told Prime Minister Eliakim, Assistant Prime Minister Shebna, and the senior priests to dress in sackcloth and tell me:"
Isaiah,37,3,"Isaiah, these are difficult and disgraceful times. Our nation is like a woman too weak to give birth, when it's time for her baby to be born."
Isaiah,37,4,"Please pray for those of us who are left alive. The king of Assyria sent his army commander to insult the living God. Perhaps the LORD heard what he said and will do something, if you will pray."
Isaiah,37,5,"When these leaders came to me,"
Isaiah,37,6,I told them that the LORD had this message for Hezekiah: I am the LORD . Don't worry about the insulting things that have been said about me by these messengers from the king of Assyria.
Isaiah,37,7,"I will upset him with rumours about what's happening in his own country. He will go back, and there I will make him die a violent death."
Isaiah,37,8,Meanwhile the commander of the Assyrian forces heard that his king had left the town of Lachish and was now attacking Libnah. So he went there.
Isaiah,37,9,"About this same time, the king of Assyria learnt that King Tirhakah of Ethiopia was on his way to attack him. Then the king of Assyria sent some messengers with this note for Hezekiah:"
Isaiah,37,10,Don't trust your God or be fooled by his promise to defend Jerusalem against me.
Isaiah,37,11,You have heard how we Assyrian kings have completely wiped out other nations. What makes you feel so safe?
Isaiah,37,12,"The Assyrian kings before me destroyed the towns of Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and everyone from Eden who lived in Telassar. What good did their gods do them?"
Isaiah,37,13,"The kings of Hamath, Arpad, Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah have all disappeared."
Isaiah,37,14,"After Hezekiah had read the note from the king of Assyria, he took it to the temple and spread it out for the LORD to see."
Isaiah,37,15,Then he prayed:
Isaiah,37,16," LORD God All-Powerful of Israel, your throne is above the winged creatures. You created the heavens and the earth, and you alone rule the kingdoms of this world."
Isaiah,37,17,"Just look and see how Sennacherib has insulted you, the living God."
Isaiah,37,18,"It is true, our LORD , that Assyrian kings have turned nations into deserts."
Isaiah,37,19,They destroyed the idols of wood and stone that the people of those nations had made and worshipped.
Isaiah,37,20,But you are our LORD and our God! We ask you to keep us safe from the Assyrian king. Then everyone in every kingdom on earth will know that you are the only LORD.
Isaiah,38,1,"About this time, Hezekiah got sick and was almost dead. So I went in and told him, “The LORD says you won't ever get well. You are going to die, and so you had better start doing what needs to be done.”"
Isaiah,38,2,"Hezekiah turned towards the wall and prayed,"
Isaiah,38,3,"“Don't forget that I have been faithful to you, LORD . I have obeyed you with all my heart, and I do whatever you say is right.” After this, he cried hard."
Isaiah,38,4,Then the LORD sent me
Isaiah,38,5,"with this message for Hezekiah: I am the LORD God, who was worshipped by your ancestor David. I heard you pray, and I saw you cry. I will let you live fifteen years more,"
Isaiah,38,6,while I protect you and your city from the king of Assyria.
Isaiah,38,7,Now I will prove to you that I will keep my promise.
Isaiah,38,8,Do you see the shadow made by the setting sun on the stairway built for King Ahaz? I will make the shadow go back ten steps. Then the shadow went back ten steps.
Isaiah,38,9,This is what Hezekiah wrote after he got well:
Isaiah,38,10,I thought I would die during my best years and stay as a prisoner for ever in the world of the dead.
Isaiah,38,11,"I thought I would never again see you, my LORD, or any of the people who live on this earth."
Isaiah,38,12,My life was taken from me like the tent that a shepherd pulls up and moves. You cut me off like thread from a weaver's loom; you make a wreck of me day and night.
Isaiah,38,13,"Until morning came, I thought you would crush my bones just like a hungry lion; both night and day you make a wreck of me."
Isaiah,38,14,"I cry like a swallow; I mourn like a dove. My eyes are red from looking to you, LORD. I am terribly abused. Please come and help me."
Isaiah,38,15,"There's nothing I can say in answer to you, since you are the one who has done this to me. My life has turned sour; I will limp until I die."
Isaiah,38,16,"Your words and your deeds bring life to everyone, including me. Please make me healthy and strong again."
Isaiah,38,17,"It was for my own good that I had such hard times. But your love protected me from doom in the deep pit, and you turned your eyes away from my sins."
Isaiah,38,18,No one in the world of the dead can thank you or praise you; none of those in the deep pit can hope for you to show them how faithful you are.
Isaiah,38,19,"Only the living can thank you, as I am doing today. Each generation tells the next about your faithfulness."
Isaiah,38,20,"You, LORD , will save me, and every day that we live we will sing in your temple to the music of stringed instruments."
Isaiah,38,21,"I had told King Hezekiah's servants to put some mashed figs on the king's open sore, and he would get well."
Isaiah,38,22,Then Hezekiah asked for proof that he would again worship in the LORD 's temple.
Isaiah,39,1,"Merodach Baladan, the son of Baladan, was now king of Babylonia. And when he learnt that Hezekiah was well, he sent messengers with letters and a gift for him."
Isaiah,39,2,"Hezekiah welcomed the messengers and showed them all the silver, the gold, the spices, and the fine oils that were in his storehouse. He even showed them where he kept his weapons. Nothing in his palace or in his entire kingdom was kept hidden from them."
Isaiah,39,3,"I asked Hezekiah, “Where did these men come from? What did they want?” “They came all the way from Babylonia,” Hezekiah answered."
Isaiah,39,4,"“What did you show them?” I asked. Hezekiah answered, “I showed them everything in my kingdom.”"
Isaiah,39,5,Then I told Hezekiah: I have a message for you from the LORD All-Powerful.
Isaiah,39,6,One day everything you and your ancestors have stored up will be taken to Babylonia. The LORD has promised that nothing will be left.
Isaiah,39,7,"Some of your own sons will be taken to Babylonia, where they will be disgraced and made to serve in the king's palace."
Isaiah,39,8,"Hezekiah thought, “At least our nation will be at peace for a while.” So he told me, “The message you brought from the LORD is good.”"
Isaiah,40,1,Our God has said: “Encourage my people! Give them comfort.
Isaiah,40,2,"Speak kindly to Jerusalem and announce: Your slavery is past; your punishment is over. I, the LORD , made you pay double for your sins.”"
Isaiah,40,3,Someone is shouting: “Clear a path in the desert! Make a straight road for the LORD our God.
Isaiah,40,4,Fill in the valleys; flatten every hill and mountain. Level the rough and rugged ground.
Isaiah,40,5,Then the glory of the LORD will appear for all to see. The LORD has promised this!”
Isaiah,40,6,"Someone told me to shout, and I asked, “What should I shout?” We humans are merely grass, and we last no longer than wild flowers."
Isaiah,40,7,"At the LORD 's command, flowers and grass disappear, and so do we."
Isaiah,40,8,"Flowers and grass fade away, but what our God has said will never change."
Isaiah,40,9,"There is good news for the city of Zion. Shout it as loud as you can from the highest mountain. Don't be afraid to shout to the towns of Judah, “Your God is here!”"
Isaiah,40,10,"Look! The powerful LORD God is coming to rule with his mighty arm. He brings with him what he has taken in war, and he rewards his people."
Isaiah,40,11,"The LORD cares for his nation, just as shepherds care for their flocks. He carries the lambs in his arms, while gently leading the mother sheep."
Isaiah,40,12,Did any of you measure the ocean by yourself or stretch out the sky with your own hands? Did you put the soil of the earth in a bucket or weigh the hills and mountains on balance scales?
Isaiah,40,13,Has anyone told the LORD what he must do or given him advice?
Isaiah,40,14,Did the LORD ask anyone to teach him wisdom and justice? Who gave him knowledge and understanding?
Isaiah,40,15,"To the LORD , all nations are merely a drop in a bucket or dust on balance scales; all the islands are but a handful of sand."
Isaiah,40,16,"The cattle on Lebanon's mountains would not be enough to offer as a sacrifice to God, and the trees would not be enough for the fire."
Isaiah,40,17,God thinks of the nations as far less than nothing.
Isaiah,40,18,Who compares with God? Is anything like him?
Isaiah,40,19,"Is an idol at all like God? It is made of bronze with a thin layer of gold, and decorated with silver."
Isaiah,40,20,Or special wood may be chosen because it doesn't rot— then skilled hands take care to make an idol that won't fall on its face.
Isaiah,40,21,Don't you know? Haven't you heard? Isn't it clear that God created the world?
Isaiah,40,22,"God is the one who rules the whole earth, and we who live here are merely insects. He spread out the heavens like a curtain or an open tent."
Isaiah,40,23,God brings down rulers and turns them into nothing.
Isaiah,40,24,"They are like flowers freshly sprung up and starting to grow. But when God blows on them, they wilt and are carried off like straw in a storm."
Isaiah,40,25,"The holy God asks, “Who compares with me? Is anyone my equal?”"
Isaiah,40,26,Look at the evening sky! Who created the stars? Who gave them each a name? Who leads them like an army? The LORD is so powerful that none of the stars are ever missing.
Isaiah,40,27,"You people of Israel, say, “God pays no attention to us! He doesn't care if we are treated unjustly.” But how can you say that?"
Isaiah,40,28,"Don't you know? Haven't you heard? The LORD is the eternal God, Creator of the earth. He never gets weary or tired; his wisdom cannot be measured."
Isaiah,40,29,The LORD gives strength to those who are weary.
Isaiah,40,30,"Even young people get tired, then stumble and fall."
Isaiah,40,31,But those who trust the LORD will find new strength. They will be strong like eagles soaring upward on wings; they will walk and run without getting tired.
Isaiah,41,1,"Be silent and listen, every island in the sea. Have courage and come near, every one of you nations. Let's settle this matter!"
Isaiah,41,2,Who appointed this ruler from the east? Who puts nations and kings in his power? His sword and his arrows turn them to dust blown by the wind.
Isaiah,41,3,He goes after them so quickly that his feet barely touch the ground— he doesn't even get hurt.
Isaiah,41,4,Who makes these things happen? Who controls human events? I do! I am the LORD. I was there at the beginning; I will be there at the end.
Isaiah,41,5,Islands and foreign nations saw what I did and trembled as they came near.
Isaiah,41,6,"Worshippers of idols comfort each other, saying, “Don't worry!”"
Isaiah,41,7,"Woodcarvers, goldsmiths, and other workers encourage one another and say, “We've done a great job!” Then they nail the idol down, so it won't fall over."
Isaiah,41,8,"Israel, you are my servant. I chose you, the family of my friend Abraham."
Isaiah,41,9,"From far across the earth I brought you here and said, “You are my chosen servant. I haven't forgotten you.”"
Isaiah,41,10,"Don't be afraid. I am with you. Don't tremble with fear. I am your God. I will make you strong, as I protect you with my arm and give you victories."
Isaiah,41,11,Everyone who hates you will be terribly disgraced; those who attack will vanish into thin air.
Isaiah,41,12,"You will look around for those brutal enemies, but you won't find them because they will be gone."
Isaiah,41,13,"I am the LORD your God. I am holding your hand, so don't be afraid. I am here to help you."
Isaiah,41,14,"People of Israel, don't worry, though others may say, “Israel is only a worm!” I am the holy God of Israel, who saves and protects you."
Isaiah,41,15,I will let you be like a log covered with sharp spikes. You will grind and crush every mountain and hill until they turn to dust.
Isaiah,41,16,"A strong wind will scatter them in all directions. Then you will celebrate and praise me, your LORD, the holy God of Israel."
Isaiah,41,17,"When the poor and needy are dying of thirst and cannot find water, I, the LORD God of Israel, will come to their rescue. I won't forget them."
Isaiah,41,18,I will make rivers flow on mountain peaks. I will send streams to fill the valleys. Dry and barren land will flow with springs and become a lake.
Isaiah,41,19,"I will fill the desert with all kinds of trees— cedars, acacias, and myrtles; olive and cypress trees; fir trees and pines."
Isaiah,41,20,"Everyone will see this and know that I, the holy LORD God of Israel, created it all."
Isaiah,41,21,"I am the LORD, the King of Israel! Come, argue your case with me. Present your evidence."
Isaiah,41,22,"Come near me, you idols. Tell us about the past, and we will think about it. Tell us about the future, so we will know what is going to happen."
Isaiah,41,23,"Prove that you are gods by making your predictions come true. Do something good or evil, so we can be amazed and terrified."
Isaiah,41,24,"You idols are nothing, and you are powerless. To worship you would be disgusting."
Isaiah,41,25,"I, the LORD , appointed a ruler in the north; now he comes from the east to honour my name. He tramples kings like mud, as potters trample clay."
Isaiah,41,26,Did any of you idols predict what would happen? Did any of you get it right? None of you told about this or even spoke a word.
Isaiah,41,27,"I was the first to tell the people of Jerusalem, “Look, it's happening!” I was the one who announced this good news to Zion."
Isaiah,41,28,None of these idols are able to give advice or answer questions.
Isaiah,41,29,"They are nothing, and they can do nothing— they are less than a passing breeze."
Isaiah,42,1,"Here is my servant! I have made him strong. He is my chosen one; I am pleased with him. I have given him my Spirit, and he will bring justice to the nations."
Isaiah,42,2,He won't shout or yell or call out in the streets.
Isaiah,42,3,"He won't break off a bent reed or put out a dying flame, but he will make sure that justice is done."
Isaiah,42,4,"He won't stop or give up until he brings justice everywhere on earth, and people in foreign nations long for his teaching."
Isaiah,42,5,"I am the LORD God. I created the heavens like an open tent above. I made the earth and everything that grows on it. I am the source of life for all who live on this earth, so listen to what I say."
Isaiah,42,6,"I chose you to bring justice, and I am here at your side. I selected and sent you to bring light and my promise of hope to the nations."
Isaiah,42,7,You will give sight to the blind; you will set prisoners free from dark dungeons.
Isaiah,42,8,My name is the LORD! I won't let idols or humans share my glory and praise.
Isaiah,42,9,Everything has happened just as I said it would; now I will announce what will happen next.
Isaiah,42,10,Tell the whole world to sing a new song to the LORD! Tell those who sail the ocean and those who live far away to join in the praise.
Isaiah,42,11,Tell the tribes of the desert and everyone in the mountains to celebrate and sing.
Isaiah,42,12,Let them announce his praises everywhere.
Isaiah,42,13,"The LORD is marching out like an angry soldier, shouting with all his might while attacking his enemies."
Isaiah,42,14,"For a long time, I, the LORD, have held my temper; now I will scream and groan like a woman giving birth."
Isaiah,42,15,I will destroy the mountains and what grows on them; I will dry up rivers and ponds.
Isaiah,42,16,"I will lead the blind on roads they have never known; I will guide them on paths they have never travelled. Their road is dark and rough, but I will give light to keep them from stumbling. This is my solemn promise."
Isaiah,42,17,Everyone who worships idols as though they were gods will be terribly ashamed.
Isaiah,42,18,"You people are deaf and blind, but the LORD commands you to listen and to see."
Isaiah,42,19,"No one is as blind or deaf as his messenger, his chosen servant,"
Isaiah,42,20,"who sees and hears so much, but pays no attention."
Isaiah,42,21,"The LORD always does right, and so he wanted his Law to be greatly praised."
Isaiah,42,22,"But his people were trapped and imprisoned in holes with no one to rescue them. All they owned had been taken, and no one was willing to give it back."
Isaiah,42,23,Why won't his people ever learn to listen?
Isaiah,42,24,Israel sinned and refused to obey the LORD or follow his instructions. So the LORD let them be robbed of everything they owned.
Isaiah,42,25,He was furious with them and punished their nation with the fires of war. Still they paid no attention. They didn't even care when they were surrounded and scorched by flames.
Isaiah,43,1,"Descendants of Jacob, I, the LORD , created you and formed your nation. Israel, don't be afraid. I have rescued you. I have called you by name; now you belong to me."
Isaiah,43,2,"When you cross deep rivers, I will be with you, and you won't drown. When you walk through fire, you won't be burnt or scorched by the flames."
Isaiah,43,3,"I am the LORD , your God, the Holy One of Israel, the God who saves you. I gave up Egypt, Ethiopia, and the region of Seba in exchange for you."
Isaiah,43,4,"To me, you are very dear, and I love you. That's why I gave up nations and people to rescue you."
Isaiah,43,5,Don't be afraid! I am with you. From both east and west I will bring you together.
Isaiah,43,6,"I will say to the north and to the south, “Free my sons and daughters! Let them return from distant lands."
Isaiah,43,7,They are my people— I created each of them to bring honour to me.”
Isaiah,43,8,"Bring my people together. They have eyes and ears, but they can't see or hear."
Isaiah,43,9,"Tell everyone of every nation to gather around. None of them can honestly say, “We told you so!” If someone heard them say this, then tell us about it now."
Isaiah,43,10,"My people, you are my witnesses and my chosen servant. I want you to know me, to trust me, and understand that I alone am God. I have always been God; there can be no others."
Isaiah,43,11,I alone am the LORD; only I can rescue you.
Isaiah,43,12,"I promised to save you, and I kept my promise. You are my witnesses that no other god did this. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Isaiah,43,13,I am God now and for ever. No one can snatch you from me or stand in my way.
Isaiah,43,14,"I, the LORD , will rescue you! I am Israel's holy God, and this is my promise: For your sake, I will send an army against Babylon to drag its people away, crying as they go."
Isaiah,43,15,"I am the LORD , your holy God, Israel's Creator and King."
Isaiah,43,16,I am the one who cut a path through the mighty ocean.
Isaiah,43,17,"I sent an army to chase you with chariots and horses; now they lie dead, unable to move. They are like an oil lamp with the flame snuffed out."
Isaiah,43,18,Forget what happened long ago! Don't think about the past.
Isaiah,43,19,"I am creating something new. There it is! Do you see it? I have put roads in deserts, streams in thirsty lands."
Isaiah,43,20,"Every wild animal honours me, even jackals and owls. I provide water in deserts— streams in thirsty lands for my chosen people."
Isaiah,43,21,"I made them my own nation, so they would praise me."
Isaiah,43,22,"I, the LORD , said to Israel: You have become weary, but not from worshipping me."
Isaiah,43,23,You have not honoured me by sacrificing sheep or other animals. And I have not burdened you with demands for sacrifices or sweet-smelling incense.
Isaiah,43,24,"You have not brought delicious spices for me or given me the best part of your sacrificed animals. Instead, you burden me down with your terrible sins."
Isaiah,43,25,"But I wipe away your sins because of who I am. And so, I will forget the wrongs you have done."
Isaiah,43,26,Meet me in court! State your case and prove that you are right.
Isaiah,43,27,Your earliest ancestor and all your leaders rebelled against me.
Isaiah,43,28,That's why I don't allow your priests to serve me; I let Israel be destroyed and your people disgraced.
Isaiah,44,1,"People of Israel, I have chosen you as my servant."
Isaiah,44,2,"I am your Creator. You were in my care even before you were born. Israel, don't be terrified! You are my chosen servant, my very favourite."
Isaiah,44,3,I will bless the thirsty land by sending streams of water; I will bless your descendants by giving them my Spirit.
Isaiah,44,4,They will spring up like grass or like willow trees near flowing streams.
Isaiah,44,5,They will worship me and become my people. They will write my name on the back of their hands.
Isaiah,44,6,"I am the LORD All-Powerful, the first and the last, the one and only God. Israel, I have rescued you! I am your King."
Isaiah,44,7,"Can anyone compare with me? If so, let them speak up and tell me now. Let them say what has happened since I made my nation long ago, and let them tell what is going to happen."
Isaiah,44,8,Don't tremble with fear! Didn't I tell you long ago? Didn't you hear me? I alone am God— no one else is a mighty rock.
Isaiah,44,9,"Those people who make idols are nothing themselves, and the idols they treasure are just as worthless. Worshippers of idols are blind, stupid, and foolish."
Isaiah,44,10,Why make an idol or an image that can't do a thing?
Isaiah,44,11,"Everyone who makes idols and all who worship them are mere humans, who will end up sadly disappointed. Let them face me in court and be terrified."
Isaiah,44,12,"A metalworker shapes an idol by using a hammer and heat from the fire. In his powerful hand he holds a hammer, as he pounds the metal into the proper shape. But he gets hungry and thirsty and loses his strength."
Isaiah,44,13,"Some woodcarver measures a piece of wood, then draws an outline. The idol is carefully carved with each detail exact. At last it looks like a person and is placed in a temple."
Isaiah,44,14,"Cedar, cypress, oak, or any tree from the forest may be chosen. Or even a pine tree planted by the woodcarver and watered by the rain."
Isaiah,44,15,"Some of the wood is used to make a fire for heating or for cooking. One piece is made into an idol, then the woodcarver bows down and worships it."
Isaiah,44,16,He enjoys the warm fire and the meat that was roasted over the burning coals.
Isaiah,44,17,"Afterwards, he bows down to worship the wooden idol. “Protect me!” he says. “You are my god.”"
Isaiah,44,18,Those who worship idols are stupid and blind!
Isaiah,44,19,"They don't have enough sense to say to themselves, “I made a fire with half of the wood and cooked my bread and meat on it. Then I made something worthless with the other half. Why worship a block of wood?”"
Isaiah,44,20,How can anyone be stupid enough to trust something that can be burnt to ashes? No one can save themselves like that. Don't they realize that the idols they hold in their hands are not really gods?
Isaiah,44,21,"People of Israel, you are my servant, so remember all of this. Israel, I created you, and you are my servant. I won't forget you."
Isaiah,44,22,Turn back to me! I have rescued you and swept away your sins as though they were clouds.
Isaiah,44,23,Tell the heavens and the earth to start singing! Tell the mountains and every tree in the forest to join in the song! The LORD has rescued his people; now they will worship him.
Isaiah,44,24,"Israel, I am your LORD. I am your source of life, and I have rescued you. I created everything from the sky above to the earth below."
Isaiah,44,25,I make liars of false prophets and fools of fortune-tellers. I take human wisdom and turn it into nonsense.
Isaiah,44,26,"I will make the message of my prophets come true. They are saying, “Jerusalem will be filled with people, and the LORD will rebuild the towns of Judah.”"
Isaiah,44,27,I am the one who commands the sea and its streams to run dry.
Isaiah,44,28,"I am also the one who says, “Cyrus will lead my people and obey my orders. Jerusalem and the temple will be rebuilt.”"
Isaiah,45,1,"The LORD said to Cyrus, his chosen one: I have taken hold of your right hand to help you capture nations and remove kings from power. City gates will open for you; not one will stay closed."
Isaiah,45,2,"As I lead you, I will level mountains and break the iron bars on bronze gates of cities."
Isaiah,45,3,"I will give you treasures hidden in dark and secret places. Then you will know that I, the LORD God of Israel, have called you by name."
Isaiah,45,4,"Cyrus, you don't even know me! But I have called you by name and highly honoured you because of Israel, my chosen servant."
Isaiah,45,5,"Only I am the LORD! There are no other gods. I have made you strong, though you don't know me."
Isaiah,45,6,Now everyone from east to west will learn that I am the LORD. No other gods are real.
Isaiah,45,7,"I create light and darkness, happiness and sorrow. I, the LORD , do all of this."
Isaiah,45,8,"Tell the heavens to send down justice like showers of rain. Prepare the earth for my saving power to sprout and produce justice that I, the LORD , create."
Isaiah,45,9,"Israel, you have no right to argue with your Creator. You are merely a clay pot shaped by a potter. The clay doesn't ask, “Why did you make me this way? Where are the handles?”"
Isaiah,45,10,"Children don't have the right to demand of their parents, “What have you done to make us what we are?”"
Isaiah,45,11,"I am the LORD , the Creator, the holy God of Israel. Do you dare question me about my own nation or about what I have done?"
Isaiah,45,12,I created the world and covered it with people; I stretched out the sky and filled it with stars.
Isaiah,45,13,"I have done the right thing by placing Cyrus in power, and I will make the roads easy for him to follow. I am the LORD All-Powerful! Cyrus will rebuild my city and set my people free without being paid a thing. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Isaiah,45,14,"My people, I, the LORD , promise that the riches of Egypt and the treasures of Ethiopia will belong to you. You will force into slavery those tall people of Seba. They will bow down and say, “The only true God is with you; there are no other gods.”"
Isaiah,45,15,"People of Israel, your God is a mystery, though he alone can save."
Isaiah,45,16,Anyone who makes idols will be confused and terribly disgraced.
Isaiah,45,17,"But Israel, I, the LORD, will always keep you safe and free from shame."
Isaiah,45,18,"The LORD alone is God! He created the heavens and made a world where people can live, instead of creating an empty desert. The LORD alone is God; there are no others."
Isaiah,45,19,"The LORD did not speak in a dark secret place or command Jacob's descendants to search for him in vain. The LORD speaks the truth, and this is what he says"
Isaiah,45,20,to every survivor from every nation: “Gather around me! Learn how senseless it is to worship wooden idols or pray to helpless gods.
Isaiah,45,21,"“Why don't you get together and meet me in court? Didn't I tell you long ago what would happen? I am the only God! There are no others. I bring about justice, and have the power to save."
Isaiah,45,22,“I invite the whole world to turn to me and be saved. I alone am God! No others are real.
Isaiah,45,23,"I have made a solemn promise, one that won't be broken: everyone will bow down and worship me."
Isaiah,45,24,They will admit that I alone can bring about justice. Everyone who is angry with me will be terribly ashamed and will turn to me.
Isaiah,45,25,"I, the LORD , will give victory and great honour to the people of Israel.”"
Isaiah,46,1,"The gods Bel and Nebo are down on their knees, as wooden images of them are carried away on weary animals."
Isaiah,46,2,"They are down on their knees to rescue the heavy load, but the images are still taken to a foreign country."
Isaiah,46,3,"You survivors in Israel, listen to me, the LORD. Since the day you were born, I have carried you along."
Isaiah,46,4,"I will still be the same when you are old and grey, and I will take care of you. I created you. I will carry you and always keep you safe."
Isaiah,46,5,Can anyone compare with me? Is anyone my equal?
Isaiah,46,6,Some people hire a goldsmith and give silver and gold to be formed into an idol for them to worship.
Isaiah,46,7,"They carry the idol on their shoulders, then put it on a stand, but it cannot move. They call out to the idol when they are in trouble, but it doesn't answer, and it cannot help."
Isaiah,46,8,"Now keep this in mind, you sinful people. And don't ever forget it."
Isaiah,46,9,I alone am God! There are no other gods; no one is like me. Think about what happened many years ago.
Isaiah,46,10,"From the very beginning, I told what would happen long before it took place. I kept my word"
Isaiah,46,11,"and brought someone from a distant land to do what I wanted. He attacked from the east, like a hawk swooping down. Now I will keep my promise and do what I planned."
Isaiah,46,12,"You people are stubborn and far from being safe, so listen to me."
Isaiah,46,13,I will soon come to save you. I am not far away and will waste no time; I take pride in Israel and will save Jerusalem.
Isaiah,47,1,"City of Babylon, you are delicate and untouched, but that will change. Surrender your royal power and sit in the dust."
Isaiah,47,2,Start grinding grain! Take off your veil. Strip off your fine clothes and cross over rivers.
Isaiah,47,3,"You will suffer the shame of going naked, because I will take revenge, and no one can escape."
Isaiah,47,4,"I am the LORD All-Powerful, the holy God of Israel. I am their Saviour."
Isaiah,47,5,"Babylon, be silent! Sit in the dark. No longer will nations accept you as their queen."
Isaiah,47,6,"I was angry with my people. So I let you take their land and bring disgrace on them. You showed them no mercy, but were especially cruel to those who were old."
Isaiah,47,7,You thought that you would be queen for ever. You didn't care what you did; it never entered your mind that you might get caught.
Isaiah,47,8,"You think that you alone are all-powerful, that you won't be a widow or lose your children. All you care about is pleasure, but listen to what I say."
Isaiah,47,9,"Your magic powers and charms will suddenly fail, then you will be a widow and lose your children."
Isaiah,47,10,"You hid behind evil like a shield and said, “No one can see me!” You were fooled by your wisdom and your knowledge; you felt sure that you alone were in full control."
Isaiah,47,11,"But without warning, disaster will strike— and your magic charms won't help at all."
Isaiah,47,12,Keep using your magic powers and your charms as you have always done. Perhaps—just perhaps— you will frighten somebody!
Isaiah,47,13,"You have worn yourself out, asking for advice from those who study the stars and tell the future month after month. Go and ask them how to be saved from what will happen."
Isaiah,47,14,"People who trust the stars are as helpless as straw in a flaming fire. No one can even keep warm, sitting by a fire that feeds only on straw."
Isaiah,47,15,"These are the fortune-tellers you have done business with all your life. But they don't know where they are going, and they can't save you."
Isaiah,48,1,"People of Israel, you come from Jacob's family and the tribe of Judah. You claim to worship me, the LORD God of Israel, but you are lying."
Isaiah,48,2,"You call Jerusalem your home and say you depend on me, the LORD All-Powerful, the God of Israel."
Isaiah,48,3,"Long ago I announced what was going to be, then without warning, I made it happen."
Isaiah,48,4,I knew you were stubborn and hard-headed.
Isaiah,48,5,"And I told you these things, so that when they happened you would not say, “The idols we worship did this.”"
Isaiah,48,6,"You heard what I said, and you have seen it happen. Now admit that it's true! I will show you secrets you have never known."
Isaiah,48,7,"Today I am doing something new, something you cannot say you have heard before."
Isaiah,48,8,"You have never been willing to listen to what I say; from the moment of your birth, I knew you would rebel."
Isaiah,48,9,"I, the LORD , am true to myself; I will be praised for not punishing and destroying you."
Isaiah,48,10,I tested you in hard times just as silver is refined in a heated furnace.
Isaiah,48,11,I did this because of who I am. I refuse to be dishonoured or share my praise with any other god.
Isaiah,48,12,"Israel, my chosen people, listen to me. I alone am the LORD, the first and the last."
Isaiah,48,13,With my own hand I created the earth and stretched out the sky. They obey my every command.
Isaiah,48,14,"Gather around me, all of you! Listen to what I say. Did any of your idols predict this would happen? Did they say that my friend would do what I want done to Babylonia?"
Isaiah,48,15,"I was the one who chose him. I have brought him this far, and he will be successful."
Isaiah,48,16,"Come closer and listen! I have never kept secret the things I have said, and I was here before time began. By the power of his Spirit the LORD God has sent me"
Isaiah,48,17,"with this message: People of Israel, I am the holy LORD God, the one who rescues you. For your own good, I teach you, and I lead you along the right path."
Isaiah,48,18,How I wish that you had obeyed my commands! Your success and good fortune would then have overflowed like a flooding river.
Isaiah,48,19,Your nation would be blessed with more people than there are grains of sand along the seashore. And I would never have let your country be destroyed.
Isaiah,48,20,"Now leave Babylon! Celebrate as you go. Be happy and shout for everyone to hear, “The LORD has rescued his servant Israel!"
Isaiah,48,21,He led us through the desert and made water flow from a rock to satisfy our thirst.
Isaiah,48,22,But the LORD has promised that none who are evil will live in peace.”
Isaiah,49,1,"Everyone, listen, even you foreign nations across the sea. The LORD chose me and gave me a name before I was born."
Isaiah,49,2,He made my words pierce like a sharp sword or a pointed arrow; he kept me safely hidden in the palm of his hand.
Isaiah,49,3,"The LORD said to me, “Israel, you are my servant; and because of you I will be highly honoured.”"
Isaiah,49,4,"I said to myself, “I'm completely worn out; my time has been wasted. But I did it for the LORD God, and he will reward me.”"
Isaiah,49,5,"Even before I was born, the LORD God chose me to serve him and to lead back the people of Israel. So the LORD has honoured me and made me strong."
Isaiah,49,6,"Now the LORD says to me, “It isn't enough for you to be merely my servant. You must do more than lead back survivors from the tribes of Israel. I have placed you here as a light for other nations; you must take my saving power to everyone on earth.”"
Isaiah,49,7,"Israel, I am the holy LORD God, the one who rescues you. You are slaves of rulers and of a nation who despises you. Now this is what I promise: kings and rulers will honour you by kneeling at your feet. You can trust me! I am your LORD, the holy God of Israel, and you are my chosen ones."
Isaiah,49,8,"This is what the LORD says: I will answer your prayers because I have set a time when I will help by coming to save you. I have chosen you to take my promise of hope to other nations. You will rebuild the country from its ruins, then people will come and settle there."
Isaiah,49,9,"You will set prisoners free from dark dungeons to see the light of day. On their way home, they will find plenty to eat, even on barren hills."
Isaiah,49,10,They won't go hungry or get thirsty; they won't be bothered by the scorching sun or hot desert winds. I will be merciful while leading them along to streams of water.
Isaiah,49,11,I will level the mountains and make roads.
Isaiah,49,12,Then my people will return from distant lands in the north and the west and from the city of Syene.
Isaiah,49,13,"Tell the heavens and the earth to celebrate and sing; command every mountain to join in the song. The LORD 's people have suffered, but he has shown mercy and given them comfort."
Isaiah,49,14,"The people of Zion said, “The LORD has turned away and forgotten us.”"
Isaiah,49,15,"The LORD answered, “Could a mother forget a child who nurses at her breast? Could she fail to love an infant who came from her own body? Even if a mother could forget, I will never forget you."
Isaiah,49,16,A picture of your city is drawn on my hand. You are always in my thoughts!
Isaiah,49,17,“Your city will be built faster than it was destroyed — those who attacked it will retreat and leave.
Isaiah,49,18,"Look around! You will see your people coming home. As surely as I live, I, the LORD , promise that your city with its people will be as lovely as a bride wearing her jewellery.”"
Isaiah,49,19,Jerusalem is now in ruins! Nothing is left of the city. But it will be rebuilt and soon overcrowded; its cruel enemies will be gone far away.
Isaiah,49,20,"Jerusalem is a woman whose children were born while she was in deep sorrow over the loss of her husband. Now those children will come and seek room in the crowded city,"
Isaiah,49,21,"and Jerusalem will ask, “Am I really their mother? How could I have given birth when I was still mourning in a foreign land? Who raised these children? Where have they come from?”"
Isaiah,49,22,The LORD God says: “I will soon give a signal for the nations to return your sons and your daughters to the arms of Jerusalem.
Isaiah,49,23,The kings and queens of those nations where they were raised will come and bow down. They will take care of you just like a slave taking care of a child. Then you will know that I am the LORD. You won't be disappointed if you trust me.”
Isaiah,49,24,Is it possible to rescue victims from someone strong and cruel?
Isaiah,49,25,But the LORD has promised to fight on our side and to rescue our children from those strong and violent enemies.
Isaiah,49,26,He will make those cruel people dine on their own flesh and get drunk from drinking their own blood. Then everyone will know that the LORD is our Saviour; the powerful God of Israel has rescued his people.
Isaiah,50,1,"The LORD says, “Children, I didn't divorce your mother or sell you to pay debts; I divorced her and sold you because of your sins."
Isaiah,50,2,"I came and called out, but you didn't answer. Have I lost my power to rescue and save? At my command oceans and rivers turn into deserts; fish rot and stink for lack of water."
Isaiah,50,3,I make the sky turn dark like the sackcloth you wear at funerals.”
Isaiah,50,4,The LORD God gives me the right words to encourage the weary. Each morning he awakens me eager to learn his teaching;
Isaiah,50,5,he made me willing to listen and not rebel or run away.
Isaiah,50,6,I let them beat my back and pull out my beard. I didn't turn aside when they insulted me and spat in my face.
Isaiah,50,7,"But the LORD God keeps me from being disgraced. So I refuse to give up, because I know God will never let me down."
Isaiah,50,8,My protector is nearby; no one can stand here to accuse me of wrong.
Isaiah,50,9,The LORD God will help me and prove I am innocent. My accusers will wear out like moth-eaten clothes.
Isaiah,50,10,None of you respect the LORD or obey his servant. You walk in the dark instead of the light; you don't trust the name of the LORD your God.
Isaiah,50,11,"Go ahead and walk in the light of the fires you have lit. But with his own hand, the LORD will punish you and make you suffer."
Isaiah,51,1,"If you want to do right and obey the LORD, follow Abraham's example. He was the rock from which you were chipped."
Isaiah,51,2,"God chose Abraham and Sarah to be your ancestors. The LORD blessed Abraham, and from that one man came many descendants."
Isaiah,51,3,"Though Zion is in ruins, the LORD will bring comfort, and the city will be as lovely as the garden of Eden that he provided. Then Zion will celebrate; it will be thankful and sing joyful songs."
Isaiah,51,4,The LORD says: You are my people and nation! So pay attention to me. My teaching will cause justice to shine like a light for every nation.
Isaiah,51,5,Those who live across the sea are eagerly waiting for me to rescue them. I am strong and ready; soon I will come to save and to rule all nations.
Isaiah,51,6,Look closely at the sky! Stare at the earth. The sky will vanish like smoke; the earth will wear out like clothes. Everyone on this earth will die like flies. But my victory will last; my saving power never ends.
Isaiah,51,7,"If you want to do right and to obey my teaching with all your heart, then pay close attention. Don't be discouraged when others insult you and say hurtful things."
Isaiah,51,8,They will be eaten away like a moth-eaten coat. But my victory will last; my saving power will never end.
Isaiah,51,9,"Wake up! Do something, LORD. Be strong and ready. Wake up! Do what you did for our people long ago. Didn't you chop up Rahab the monster?"
Isaiah,51,10,Didn't you dry up the deep sea and make a road for your people to follow safely across?
Isaiah,51,11,"Now those you have rescued will return to Jerusalem, singing on their way. They will be crowned with great happiness, never again to be burdened with sadness and sorrow."
Isaiah,51,12,"I am the LORD , the one who encourages you. Why are you afraid of mere humans? They dry up and die like grass."

Isaiah,51,17,"Jerusalem, wake up! Stand up! You've drunk too much from the cup filled with the LORD 's anger. You have swallowed every drop, and you can't walk straight."

Isaiah,52,13,The LORD says: My servant will succeed! He will be given great praise and the highest honours.
Isaiah,52,14,Many were horrified at what happened to him. But everyone who saw him was even more horrified because he suffered until he no longer looked human.
Isaiah,52,15,My servant will make nations worthy to worship me; kings will be silent as they bow in wonder. They will see and think about things they have never seen or thought about before.
Isaiah,53,1,Has anyone believed us or seen the mighty power of the LORD in action?
Isaiah,53,2,"Like a young plant or a root that sprouts in dry ground, the servant grew up obeying the LORD. He wasn't some handsome king. Nothing about the way he looked made him attractive to us."

Isaiah,53,4,"He suffered and endured great pain for us, but we thought his suffering was punishment from God."
Isaiah,53,5,"He was wounded and crushed because of our sins; by taking our punishment, he made us completely well."
Isaiah,53,6,"All of us were like sheep that had wandered off. We had each gone our own way, but the LORD gave him the punishment we deserved."
Isaiah,53,7,"He was painfully abused, but he did not complain. He was silent like a lamb being led to the butcher, as quiet as a sheep having its wool cut off."
Isaiah,53,8,He was condemned to death without a fair trial. Who could have imagined what would happen to him? His life was taken away because of the sinful things my people had done.
Isaiah,53,9,"He wasn't dishonest or violent, but he was buried in a tomb of cruel and rich people."
Isaiah,53,10,The LORD decided his servant would suffer as a sacrifice to take away the sin and guilt of others. Now the servant will live to see his own descendants. He did everything the LORD had planned.

Isaiah,54,9,I once promised Noah that I would never again destroy the earth by a flood. Now I have promised that I will never again get angry and punish you.
Isaiah,54,10,Every mountain and hill may disappear. But I will always be kind and merciful to you; I won't break my agreement to give your nation peace.
Isaiah,54,11,"Jerusalem, you are sad and discouraged, tossed around in a storm. But I, the LORD, will rebuild your city with precious stones; for your foundation I will use blue sapphires."
Isaiah,54,12,"Your fortresses will be built of rubies, your gates of jewels, and your walls of gems."

Isaiah,54,14,You will be built on fairness with no fears of injustice; every one of your worries will be taken far from you.
Isaiah,54,15,"I will never send anyone to attack your city, and you will make prisoners of those who do attack."

Isaiah,55,13,Cypress and myrtle trees will grow in fields once covered by thorns. And then those trees will stand as a lasting witness to the glory of the LORD.
Isaiah,56,1,The LORD said: Be honest and fair! Soon I will come to save you; my saving power will be seen everywhere on earth.
Isaiah,56,2,I will bless everyone who respects the Sabbath and refuses to do wrong.
Isaiah,56,3,"Foreigners who worship me must not say, “The LORD won't let us be part of his people.” Men who are unable to become fathers must no longer say, “We are dried up trees.”"

Isaiah,56,10,"You leaders of Israel should be watchdogs, protecting my people. But you can't see a thing, and you never warn them. Dozing and daydreaming are all you ever do."
Isaiah,56,11,You stupid leaders are a pack of hungry and greedy dogs that never get enough. You are shepherds who ill-treat your own sheep for selfish gain.
Isaiah,56,12,"You say to each other, “Let's drink till we're drunk! Tomorrow we'll do it again. We'll really enjoy ourselves.”"
Isaiah,57,1,"God's faithful people are dragged off and killed, and no one even cares. Evil sweeps them away,"
Isaiah,57,2,but in death they find peace for obeying God.
Isaiah,57,3,"You people are unfaithful! You go to fortune-tellers, and you worship idols. Now pay close attention!"
Isaiah,57,4,Who are you making fun of? Who are you sneering at? Look how your sins have made fools of you.
Isaiah,57,5,All you think about is sex under those green trees where idols are worshipped. You sacrifice your children on altars built in valleys under rocky slopes.
Isaiah,57,6,You have chosen to worship idols made of stone; you have given them offerings of wine and grain. Should I be pleased?
Isaiah,57,7,"You have spread out your beds on the tops of high mountains, where you sacrifice to idols."
Isaiah,57,8,"Even in your homes you have placed pagan symbols all around your huge beds. Yes, you have rejected me, sold yourselves to your lovers, and gone to bed with them."
Isaiah,57,9,You smear on olive oil and all kinds of perfume to worship the god Molech. You even seek advice from spirits of the dead.
Isaiah,57,10,"Though you tired yourself out by running after idols, you refused to stop. Your desires were so strong that they kept you going."
Isaiah,57,11,Did you forget about me and become unfaithful because you were more afraid of someone else? Have I been silent so long that you no longer fear me?
Isaiah,57,12,"You think you're so good, but I'll point out the truth."
Isaiah,57,13,"Ask your idols to save you when you are in trouble. Be careful though— it takes only a faint breath to blow them over. But if you come to me for protection, this land and my holy mountain will always belong to you."
Isaiah,57,14,"The LORD says, “Clear the road! Get it ready for my people.”"
Isaiah,57,15,"Our holy God lives for ever in the highest heavens, and this is what he says: Though I live high above in the holy place, I am here to help those who are humble and depend only on me."
Isaiah,57,16,"My people, I won't stay angry and keep on accusing you. After all, I am your Creator. I don't want you to give up in complete despair."

Isaiah,57,18,"I know what you are like! But I will heal you, lead you, and give you comfort, until those who are mourning"

Isaiah,58,1,Shout the message! Don't hold back. Say to my people Israel: You've sinned! You've turned against the LORD.
Isaiah,58,2,"Day after day, you worship him and seem eager to learn his teachings. You act like a nation that wants to do right by obeying his laws. You ask him about justice, and say you enjoy worshipping the LORD."
Isaiah,58,3,"You wonder why the LORD pays no attention when you go without eating and act humble. But on those same days that you give up eating, you think only of yourselves and abuse your workers."
Isaiah,58,4,You even get angry and ready to fight. No wonder God won't listen to your prayers!
Isaiah,58,5,Do you think the LORD wants you to give up eating and to act as humble as a bent over bush? Or to dress in sackcloth and sit in ashes? Is this really what he wants on a day of worship?
Isaiah,58,6,I'll tell you what it really means to worship the LORD. Remove the chains of prisoners who are chained unjustly. Free those who are abused!
Isaiah,58,7,Share your food with everyone who is hungry; share your home with the poor and homeless. Give clothes to those in need; don't turn away your relatives.
Isaiah,58,8,"Then your light will shine like the dawning sun, and you will quickly be healed. Your honesty will protect you as you advance, and the glory of the LORD will defend you from behind."
Isaiah,58,9,"When you beg the LORD for help, he will answer, “Here I am!” Don't ill-treat others or falsely accuse them or say something cruel."
Isaiah,58,10,Give your food to the hungry and care for the homeless. Then your light will shine in the dark; your darkest hour will be like the noonday sun.
Isaiah,58,11,The LORD will always guide you and provide good things to eat when you are in the desert. He will make you healthy. You will be like a garden that has plenty of water or like a stream that never runs dry.
Isaiah,58,12,You will rebuild those houses left in ruins for years; you will be known as a builder and repairer of city walls and streets.
Isaiah,58,13,"But first, you must start respecting the Sabbath as a joyful day of worship. You must stop doing and saying whatever you please on this special day."
Isaiah,58,14,Then you will truly enjoy knowing the LORD. He will let you rule from the highest mountains and bless you with the land of your ancestor Jacob. The LORD has spoken!
Isaiah,59,1,The LORD hasn't lost his powerful strength; he can still hear and answer prayers.
Isaiah,59,2,Your sins are the roadblock between you and your God. That's why he doesn't answer your prayers or let you see his face.
Isaiah,59,3,Your talk is filled with lies and plans for violence; every finger on your hands is covered with blood.
Isaiah,59,4,You falsely accuse others and tell lies in court; sin and trouble are the names of your children.
Isaiah,59,5,"You eat the deadly eggs of poisonous snakes, and more snakes crawl out from the eggs left to hatch. You weave spider's webs,"
Isaiah,59,6,but you can't make clothes with those webs or hide behind them. You're sinful and brutal.
Isaiah,59,7,You hurry off to do wrong or murder innocent victims. All you think about is sin; you leave ruin and destruction wherever you go.
Isaiah,59,8,You don't know how to live in peace or to be fair with others. The roads you make are crooked; your followers cannot find peace.
Isaiah,59,9,"No one has come to defend us or to bring about justice. We hoped for a day of sunshine, but all we found was a dark, gloomy night."
Isaiah,59,10,"We feel our way along, as if we were blind; we stumble at midday, as if it were night. We can see no better than someone dead."
Isaiah,59,11,"We growl like bears and mourn like doves. We hope for justice and victory, but they escape us."
Isaiah,59,12,"How often have we sinned and turned against you, the LORD God? Our sins condemn us! We have done wrong."
Isaiah,59,13,"We have rebelled and refused to follow you. Our hearts were deceitful, and so we lied; we planned to abuse others and turn our backs on you."
Isaiah,59,14,Injustice is everywhere; justice seems far away. Truth is chased out of court; honesty is shoved aside.
Isaiah,59,15,"Everyone tells lies; those who turn from crime end up ruined. When the LORD noticed that justice had disappeared, he became very displeased."
Isaiah,59,16,"It disgusted him even more to learn that no one would do a thing about it. So with his own powerful arm, he won victories for truth."
Isaiah,59,17,Justice was the LORD 's armour; saving power was his helmet; anger and revenge were his clothes.
Isaiah,59,18,"Now the LORD will get furious and do to his enemies, both near and far, what they did to his people."
Isaiah,59,19,He will attack like a flood in a mighty storm. Nations in the west and the east will then honour and praise his wonderful name.
Isaiah,59,20,The LORD has promised to rescue the city of Zion and Jacob's descendants who turn from sin.

Isaiah,60,3,Nations and kings will come to the light of your dawning day.
Isaiah,60,4,Open your eyes! Look around! Crowds are coming. Your sons are on their way from distant lands; your daughters are being carried like little children.
Isaiah,60,5,"When you see this, your faces will glow; your hearts will pound and swell with pride. Treasures from across the sea and the wealth of nations will be brought to you."
Isaiah,60,6,"Your country will be covered with caravans of young camels from Midian and Ephah. The people of Sheba will bring gold and spices in praise of me, the LORD."
Isaiah,60,7,Every sheep of Kedar will come to you; rams from Nebaioth will be yours as well. I will accept them as offerings and bring honour to my temple.
Isaiah,60,8,What is that sailing by like clouds or like doves flying home?
Isaiah,60,9,"On those distant islands your people are waiting for me, the LORD. Seagoing ships lead the way to bring them home with their silver and gold. I, the holy LORD God of Israel, do this to honour your people, so they will honour me."
Isaiah,60,10,"Jerusalem, your city walls will be rebuilt by foreigners; their rulers will become your slaves. I punished you in my anger; now I will be kind and treat you with mercy."

Isaiah,60,19,"You won't need the light of the sun or the moon. I, the LORD your God, will be your eternal light and bring you honour."
Isaiah,60,20,"Your sun will never set or your moon go down. I, the LORD , will be your everlasting light, and your days of sorrow will come to an end."
Isaiah,60,21,Your people will live right and always own the land; they are the trees I planted to bring praise to me.
Isaiah,60,22,"Even the smallest family will be a powerful nation. I am the LORD, and when the time comes, I will quickly do all this."
Isaiah,61,1,"The Spirit of the LORD God has taken control of me! The LORD has chosen and sent me to tell the oppressed the good news, to heal the brokenhearted, and to announce freedom for prisoners and captives."
Isaiah,61,2,"This is the year when the LORD God will show kindness to us and punish our enemies. The LORD has sent me to comfort those who mourn,"
Isaiah,61,3,"especially in Jerusalem. He sent me to give them flowers in place of their sorrow, olive oil in place of tears, and joyous praise in place of broken hearts. They will be called “Trees of Justice”, planted by the LORD to honour his name."
Isaiah,61,4,Then they will rebuild cities that have been in ruins for many generations.
Isaiah,61,5,They will hire foreigners to take care of their sheep and their vineyards.
Isaiah,61,6,"But they themselves will be priests and servants of the LORD our God. The treasures of the nations will belong to them, and they will be famous."
Isaiah,61,7,They were terribly insulted and horribly ill-treated; now they will be greatly blessed and joyful for ever.
Isaiah,61,8,"I, the LORD , love justice! But I hate robbery and injustice. My people, I solemnly promise to reward you with an eternal agreement."
Isaiah,61,9,"Your descendants will be known in every nation. All who see them will realize that they have been blessed, by me, the LORD."
Isaiah,61,10,I celebrate and shout because of my LORD God. His saving power and justice are the very clothes I wear. They are more beautiful than the jewellery worn by a bride or a groom.
Isaiah,61,11,"The LORD will bring about justice and praise in every nation on earth, like flowers blooming in a garden."
Isaiah,62,1,"Jerusalem, I will speak up for your good. I will never be silent till you are safe and secure, sparkling like a flame."

Isaiah,62,7,and not let him rest till he makes Jerusalem strong and famous everywhere.
Isaiah,62,8,The LORD has given his word and made this promise: “Never again will I give to your enemies the grain and grapes for which you struggled.

Isaiah,62,12,"Then you will be called, ‘The LORD 's Own People, The Ones He Rescued!’ Your city will be known as a good place to live and a city full of people.”"
Isaiah,63,1,"Who is this coming from Bozrah in Edom with clothes stained red? Who is this hero marching in his glorious uniform? “It's me, the LORD! I have won the battle, and I can save you!”"
Isaiah,63,2,What are those red spots? Your clothes look stained from trampling on grapes.
Isaiah,63,3,“I alone trampled the grapes! None of the nations helped. I trampled nations in my anger and stained my clothes with their blood.
Isaiah,63,4,I did this because I wanted to take revenge— the time had come to rescue my people.
Isaiah,63,5,"No one was there to help me or to give support; my mighty arm won the battle, strengthened by my anger."
Isaiah,63,6,In my fury I trampled on nations and made them drunk; their blood poured out everywhere on earth.”

Isaiah,63,9,"It troubled the LORD to see them in trouble, and his angel saved them. The LORD was truly merciful, so he rescued his people. He took them in his arms and carried them all those years."
Isaiah,63,10,Then the LORD 's people turned against him and made his Holy Spirit sad. So he became their enemy and attacked them.
Isaiah,63,11,But his people remembered what had happened during the time of Moses. Didn't the LORD bring them and their leaders safely through the sea? Didn't he give them his Holy Spirit?

Isaiah,63,13,He led his people across like horses running wild without stumbling.
Isaiah,63,14,"His Spirit gave them rest, just as cattle find rest when led into a valley. The name of the LORD was praised for doing these things."

Isaiah,63,16,Our ancestors Abraham and Jacob have both rejected us. But you are still our Father; you have been our protector since ancient times.
Isaiah,63,17,"Why did you make us turn away from you, our LORD? Why did you make us want to disobey you? Please change your mind! We are your servants, your very own people."
Isaiah,63,18,"For a little while, your temple belonged to us; and now our enemies have torn it down."
Isaiah,63,19,We act as though you had never ruled us or called us your people.
Isaiah,64,1,"Rip the heavens apart! Come down, LORD; make the mountains tremble."
Isaiah,64,2,Be a spark that starts a fire causing water to boil. Then your enemies will know who you are; all nations will tremble because you are nearby.
Isaiah,64,3,Your fearsome deeds have completely amazed us; even the mountains shake when you come down.
Isaiah,64,4,You are the only God ever seen or heard of who works miracles for his followers.
Isaiah,64,5,"You help all who gladly obey and do what you want, but sin makes you angry. Only by your help can we ever be saved."
Isaiah,64,6,We are unfit to worship you; each of our good deeds is merely a filthy rag. We dry up like leaves; our sins are storm winds sweeping us away.
Isaiah,64,7,No one worships in your name or remains faithful. You have turned your back on us and let our sins melt us away.
Isaiah,64,8,"You, LORD , are our Father. We are nothing but clay, but you are the potter who moulded us."
Isaiah,64,9,Don't be so furious or keep our sins in your thoughts for ever! Remember that all of us are your people.
Isaiah,64,10,"Every one of your towns has turned into a desert, especially Jerusalem."
Isaiah,64,11,Zion's glorious and holy temple where our ancestors praised you has been destroyed by fire. Our beautiful buildings are now a pile of ruins.
Isaiah,64,12,"When you see these things, how can you just sit there and make us suffer more?"
Isaiah,65,1,"I, the LORD , was ready to answer even those who were not asking and to be found by those who were not searching. To a nation that refused to worship me, I said, “Here I am!”"
Isaiah,65,2,All day long I have reached out to stubborn and sinful people going their own way.
Isaiah,65,3,"They keep making me angry by sneering at me, while offering sacrifices to idols in gardens and burning incense to them on bricks."
Isaiah,65,4,"They spend their nights hiding in burial caves; they eat the meat of pigs, cooked in sauces made of stuff unfit to eat."
