Esther,2,1,"After a while, King Xerxes got over being angry. But he kept thinking about what Vashti had done and the law that he had written because of her."
Esther,2,2,"Then the king's personal servants said: Your Majesty, a search must be made to find you some beautiful young women."
Esther,2,3,You can select officers in every province to bring them to the place where you keep your wives in the capital city of Susa. Put your servant Hegai in charge of them since that is his job. He can see to it that they are given the proper beauty treatments.
Esther,2,4,"Then let the young woman who pleases you most take Vashti's place as queen. King Xerxes liked these suggestions, and he followed them."
Esther,2,5,"At this time a Jew named Mordecai was living in Susa. His father was Jair, and his grandfather Shimei was the son of Kish from the tribe of Benjamin."
Esther,2,6,"Kish was one of the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had taken from Jerusalem, when he took King Jeconiah of Judah to Babylonia."
Esther,2,7,"Mordecai had a very beautiful cousin named Esther, whose Hebrew name was Hadassah. He had raised her as his own daughter, after her father and mother died."
Esther,2,8,"When the king ordered the search for beautiful women, many were taken to the king's palace in Susa, and Esther was one of them. Hegai was put in charge of all the women,"
Esther,2,9,"and from the first day, Esther was his favourite. He began her beauty treatments at once. He also gave her plenty of food and seven special maids from the king's palace, and they had the best rooms."
Esther,2,10,"Mordecai had warned Esther not to tell anyone that she was a Jew, and she obeyed him."
Esther,2,11,He was anxious to see how Esther was getting on and to learn what had happened to her. So each day he would walk back and forth in front of the court where the women lived.
Esther,2,12,"The young women were given beauty treatments for one whole year. The first six months their skin was rubbed with olive oil and myrrh, and the last six months it was treated with perfumes and cosmetics. Then each of them spent the night alone with King Xerxes."
Esther,2,13,"When a young woman went to the king, she could wear whatever clothes or jewellery she chose from the women's living quarters."
Esther,2,14,"In the evening she would go to the king, and the following morning she would go to the place where his wives stayed after being with him. There a man named Shaashgaz was in charge of the king's wives. Only the ones the king wanted and asked for by name could go back to the king."
Esther,3,1,"Later, King Xerxes promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha to the highest position in his kingdom. Haman was a descendant of Agag,"
Esther,3,2,and the king had given orders for his officials at the royal gate to honour Haman by kneeling down to him. All of them obeyed except Mordecai.
Esther,3,3,"When the other officials asked Mordecai why he disobeyed the king's command,"
Esther,3,4,"he said, “Because I am a Jew.” They spoke to him for several days about kneeling down, but he still refused to obey. Finally, they reported this to Haman, to find out if he would let Mordecai get away with it."
Esther,3,5,Haman was furious to learn that Mordecai refused to kneel down and honour him.
Esther,3,6,"And when he found out that Mordecai was a Jew, he knew that killing only Mordecai was not enough. Every Jew in the whole kingdom had to be killed."
Esther,3,7,"It was now the twelfth year of the rule of King Xerxes. During Nisan, the first month of the year, Haman said, “Find out the best time for me to do this.” The time chosen was Adar, the twelfth month."
Esther,3,8,"Then Haman went to the king and said: Your Majesty, there are some people who live all over your kingdom and won't have a thing to do with anyone else. They have customs that are different from everyone else's, and they refuse to obey your laws. We would be better off to get rid of them!"
Esther,3,9,Why not give orders for all of them to be killed? I can promise that you will get a great deal of silver for your treasury.
Esther,3,10,"The king handed his official ring to Haman, who hated the Jews, and the king told him,"
Esther,3,11,“Do what you want with those people! You can keep their money.”
Esther,3,12,"On the thirteenth day of Nisan, Haman called in the king's secretaries and ordered them to write letters in every language used in the kingdom. The letters were written in the name of the king and sealed by using the king's own ring. At once they were sent to the king's highest officials, the governors of each province, and the leaders of the different nations in the kingdom of Xerxes."
Esther,3,13,"The letters were taken by messengers to every part of the kingdom, and this is what was said in the letters: On the thirteenth day of Adar, the twelfth month, all Jewish men, women, and children are to be killed. And their property is to be taken."
Esther,4,1,"When Mordecai heard about the letter, he tore his clothes in sorrow and put on sackcloth. Then he covered his head with ashes and went through the city, crying and weeping."
Esther,4,2,"But he could go only as far as the palace gate, because no one wearing sackcloth was allowed inside the palace."
Esther,4,3,"In every province where the king's orders were read, the Jews cried and mourned, and they went without eating. Many of them even put on sackcloth and sat in ashes."
Esther,4,4,"When Esther's servant girls and her other servants told her what Mordecai was doing, she became very upset and sent Mordecai some clothes to wear in place of the sackcloth. But he refused to take them."
Esther,4,5,"Esther had a servant named Hathach, who had been given to her by the king. So she called him in and said, “Find out what's wrong with Mordecai and why he's acting this way.”"
Esther,4,6,"Hathach went to Mordecai in the city square in front of the palace gate,"
Esther,4,7,"and Mordecai told him everything that had happened. He also told him how much money Haman had promised to add to the king's treasury, if all the Jews were killed."
Esther,4,8,"Mordecai gave Hathach a copy of the orders for the murder of the Jews and told him that these had been read in Susa. He said, “Show this to Esther and explain what it means. Ask her to go to the king and beg him to have pity on her people, the Jews!”"
Esther,4,9,Hathach went back to Esther and told her what Mordecai had said.
Esther,4,10,"She answered, “Tell Mordecai"
Esther,4,11,"there is a law about going in to see the king, and all his officials and his people know about this law. Anyone who goes in to see the king without being invited by him will be put to death. The only way that anyone can be saved is for the king to hold out the gold sceptre to that person. And it's been thirty days since he has asked for me.”"
Esther,4,12,"When Mordecai was told what Esther had said,"
Esther,4,13,"he sent back this reply, “Don't think that you will escape being killed with the rest of the Jews, just because you live in the king's palace."
Esther,4,14,"If you don't speak up now, we will somehow get help, but you and your family will be killed. It could be that you were made queen for a time like this!”"
Esther,4,15,"Esther sent a message to Mordecai, saying,"
Esther,4,16,"“Bring together all the Jews in Susa and tell them to go without eating for my sake! Don't eat or drink for three days and nights. My servant girls and I will do the same. Then I will go in to see the king, even if it means I must die.”"
Esther,4,17,Mordecai did everything Esther told him to do.
Esther,5,1,"Three days later, Esther dressed in her royal robes and went to the inner court of the palace in front of the throne. The king was sitting there, facing the open doorway."
Esther,5,2,"He was happy to see Esther, and he held out the gold sceptre to her. When Esther came up and touched the tip of the sceptre,"
Esther,5,3,"the king said, “Esther, what brings you here? Just ask, and I will give you as much as half of my kingdom.”"
Esther,5,4,"Esther answered, “Your Majesty, please come with Haman to a dinner I will prepare for you later today.”"
Esther,5,5,"The king said to his servants, “Hurry and get Haman, so we can accept Esther's invitation.” The king and Haman went to Esther's dinner,"
Esther,5,6,"and while they were drinking wine, the king asked her, “What can I do for you? Just ask, and I will give you as much as half of my kingdom.”"
Esther,6,1,"That night the king could not sleep, and he got a servant to read him the records of what had happened since he had been king."
Esther,6,2,"When the servant read how Mordecai had kept Bigthana and Teresh from killing the king,"
Esther,6,3,"the king asked, “What has been done to reward Mordecai for this?” “Nothing, Your Majesty!” the king's servants replied."
Esther,6,4,"About this time, Haman came in to ask the king to have Mordecai hanged on the tower he had built. The king saw him and asked, “Who is that man waiting in front of the throne room?”"
Esther,6,5,"The king's servants answered, “Your Majesty, it is Haman.” “Tell him to come in,” the king commanded."
Esther,6,6,"When Haman entered the room, the king asked him, “What should I do for a man I want to honour?” Haman was sure that he was the one the king wanted to honour."
Esther,6,7,"So he replied, “Your Majesty, if you wish to honour a man,"
Esther,6,8,get someone to bring him one of your own robes and one of your own horses with a fancy head-dress.
Esther,6,9,"Tell one of your highest officials to place your robe on this man and lead him through the streets on your horse, while someone shouts, ‘This is how the king honours a man!’ ”"
Esther,6,10,"The king replied, “Hurry and do just what you have said! Don't forget a thing. Get the robe and the horse for Mordecai the Jew, who is on duty at the palace gate!”"
Esther,6,11,"Haman got the king's robe and put it on Mordecai. He led him through the city on the horse and shouted as he went, “This is how the king honours a man!”"
Esther,6,12,"Afterwards, Mordecai returned to his duties at the palace gate, and Haman hurried home, hiding his face in shame."
Esther,6,13,"Haman told his wife and friends what had happened. Then his wife and his advisers said, “If Mordecai is a Jew, this is just the beginning of your troubles! You will end up a ruined man.”"
Esther,6,14,"They were still talking, when the king's servants came and quickly took Haman to the dinner that Esther had prepared."
Esther,7,1,The king and Haman were dining with Esther
Esther,7,2,"and drinking wine during the second dinner, when the king again said, “Esther, what can I do for you? Just ask, and I will give you as much as half of my kingdom!”"
Esther,7,3,"Esther answered, “Your Majesty, if you really care for me and are willing to help, you can save me and my people. That's what I really want,"
Esther,7,4,"because a reward has been promised to anyone who kills my people. Your Majesty, if we were merely going to be sold as slaves, I would not have bothered you.”"
Esther,7,5,“Who would dare to do such a thing?” the king asked.
Esther,7,6,"Esther replied, “That evil Haman is the one out to get us!” Haman was terrified, as he looked at the king and the queen."
Esther,7,7,"The king was so angry that he got up, left his wine, and went out into the palace garden. Haman realized that the king had already decided what to do with him, and he stayed and begged Esther to save his life."
Esther,7,8,"Just as the king came back into the room, Haman got down on his knees beside Esther, who was lying on the couch. The king shouted, “Now you're even trying to rape my queen here in my own palace!” As soon as the king said this, his servants covered Haman's head."
Esther,7,9,"Then Harbona, one of the king's personal servants, said, “Your Majesty, Haman built a tower twenty-two metres high beside his house, so he could hang Mordecai on it. And Mordecai is the very one who spoke up and saved your life.” “Hang Haman from his own tower!” the king commanded."
Esther,7,10,"Straight away, Haman was hanged on the tower he had built to hang Mordecai, and the king calmed down."
Esther,8,1,"Before the end of the day, King Xerxes gave Esther everything that had belonged to Haman, the enemy of the Jews. Esther told the king that Mordecai was her cousin. So the king made Mordecai one of his highest officials"
Esther,8,2,and gave him the royal ring that Haman had worn. Then Esther put Mordecai in charge of Haman's property.
Esther,8,3,"Once again Esther went to speak to the king. This time she fell down at his feet, crying and begging, “Please stop Haman's evil plan to have the Jews killed!”"
Esther,8,4,"King Xerxes held out the golden sceptre to Esther,"
Esther,8,5,"and she got up and said, “Your Majesty, I know that you will do the right thing and that you really love me. Please stop what Haman has planned. He has already sent letters demanding that the Jews in all your provinces be killed,"
Esther,8,6,and I can't bear to see my people and my own relatives destroyed.”
Esther,8,7,"King Xerxes then said to Esther and Mordecai, “I have already ordered Haman to be hanged and his house given to Esther, because of his evil plans to kill the Jews."
Esther,8,8,"I now give you permission to make a law that will save the lives of your people. You may use my ring to seal the law, so that it can never be changed.”"
Esther,8,9,"On the twenty-third day of Sivan, the third month, the king's secretaries wrote the law. They obeyed Mordecai and wrote to the Jews, the rulers, the governors, and the officials of all one hundred and twenty-seven provinces from India to Ethiopia. The letters were written in every language used in the kingdom, including the Jewish language."
Esther,8,10,They were written in the name of King Xerxes and sealed with his ring. Then they were taken by messengers who rode the king's finest and fastest horses.
Esther,9,1,"The first law that the king had made was to be followed on the thirteenth day of Adar, the twelfth month. This was the very day that the enemies of the Jews had hoped to do away with them. But the Jews turned things around,"
Esther,9,2,"and in the cities of every province they came together to attack their enemies. Everyone was afraid of the Jews, and no one could do anything to oppose them."
Esther,9,3,"The leaders of the provinces, the rulers, the governors, and the court officials were afraid of Mordecai and took sides with the Jews."
Esther,9,4,Everyone in the provinces knew that the king had promoted him and had given him a lot of power.
Esther,9,5,"The Jews took their swords and did away with their enemies, without showing any mercy."
Esther,10,1,"King Xerxes made everyone in his kingdom pay taxes, even those in lands across the sea."
Esther,10,2,All the great and famous things that King Xerxes did are written in the record books of the kings of Media and Persia. These records also tell about the honours that the king gave to Mordecai.
Esther,10,3,"Next to the king himself, Mordecai was the highest official in the kingdom. He was a popular leader of the Jews, because he helped them in many ways and would even speak to the king for them."
