1 Samuel,1,1,"Elkanah lived in Ramah, a town in the hill country of Ephraim. His great-great-grandfather was Zuph, so Elkanah was a member of the Zuph clan of the Ephraim tribe. Elkanah's father was Jeroham, his grandfather was Elihu, and his great-grandfather was Tohu."
1 Samuel,1,2,"Elkanah had two wives, Hannah and Peninnah. Although Peninnah had children, Hannah did not have any."
1 Samuel,1,3,"Once a year Elkanah travelled from his home town to Shiloh, where he worshipped the LORD All-Powerful and offered sacrifices. Eli was the LORD 's priest there, and his two sons Hophni and Phinehas served with him as priests."
1 Samuel,1,4,"Whenever Elkanah offered a sacrifice, he gave some of the meat to Peninnah and some to each of her sons and daughters."
1 Samuel,1,5,"But he gave Hannah even more, because he loved Hannah very much, even though the LORD had kept her from having children of her own."
1 Samuel,1,6,"Peninnah liked to make Hannah feel miserable about not having any children,"
1 Samuel,1,7,"especially when the family went to the house of the LORD each year. One day, Elkanah was there offering a sacrifice, when Hannah began crying and refused to eat."
1 Samuel,1,8,"So Elkanah asked, “Hannah, why are you crying? Why won't you eat? Why do you feel so bad? Don't I mean more to you than ten sons?”"
1 Samuel,1,9,"When the sacrifice had been offered, and they had eaten the meal, Hannah got up and went to pray. Eli was sitting in his chair near the door to the place of worship."
1 Samuel,1,10,"Hannah was brokenhearted and was crying as she prayed,"
1 Samuel,1,11,"“ LORD All-Powerful, I am your servant, but I am so miserable! Please let me have a son. I will give him to you for as long as he lives, and his hair will never be cut.”"
1 Samuel,2,1,"Hannah prayed: You make me strong and happy, LORD. You rescued me. Now I can be glad and laugh at my enemies."
1 Samuel,2,2,No other god is like you. We're safer with you than on a high mountain.
1 Samuel,2,3,"I can tell those proud people, “Stop your boasting! Nothing is hidden from the LORD, and he judges what we do.”"
1 Samuel,2,4,"Our LORD , you break the bows of warriors, but you give strength to everyone who stumbles."
1 Samuel,2,5,"People who once had plenty to eat must now hire themselves out for only a piece of bread. But you give the hungry more than enough to eat. A woman did not have a child, and you gave her seven, but a woman who had many was left with none."
1 Samuel,2,6,"You take away life, and you give life. You send people down to the world of the dead and bring them back again."
1 Samuel,2,7,"Our LORD , you are the one who makes us rich or poor. You put some in high positions and bring disgrace on others."
1 Samuel,2,8,"You lift the poor and homeless out of the rubbish dump and give them places of honour in royal palaces. You set the world on foundations, and they belong to you."
1 Samuel,2,9,"You protect your loyal people, but everyone who is evil will die in darkness. We cannot win a victory by our own strength."
1 Samuel,2,10,"Our LORD , those who attack you will be broken in pieces when you fight back with thunder from heaven. You will judge the whole earth and give power and strength to your chosen king."
1 Samuel,2,11,"Elkanah and Hannah went back home to Ramah, but the boy Samuel stayed to help Eli serve the LORD."
1 Samuel,4,1,"Then Samuel would speak to the whole nation of Israel. One day the Israelites went out to fight the Philistines. They set up camp near Ebenezer, and the Philistines camped at Aphek."
1 Samuel,4,2,The Philistines made a fierce attack. They defeated the Israelites and killed about four thousand of them.
1 Samuel,4,3,"The Israelite army returned to their camp, and the leaders said, “Why did the LORD let us lose to the Philistines today? Let's get the sacred chest where the LORD 's agreement with Israel is kept. Then the LORD will help us and rescue us from our enemies.”"
1 Samuel,4,4,"The army sent some soldiers to bring back the sacred chest from Shiloh, because the LORD All-Powerful has his throne on the winged creatures on top of the chest. As Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas,"
1 Samuel,4,5,"brought the chest into camp, the army cheered so loudly that the ground shook."
1 Samuel,4,6,"The Philistines heard the noise and said, “What are those Hebrews shouting about?” When the Philistines learnt that the sacred chest had been brought into the camp,"
1 Samuel,4,7,they were scared to death and said: The gods have come into their camp. Now we're in real trouble! Nothing like this has ever happened to us before.
1 Samuel,4,8,We're in big trouble! Who can save us from these powerful gods? They're the same gods who made all those horrible things happen to the Egyptians in the desert.
1 Samuel,4,9,"Philistines, be brave and fight hard! If you don't, those Hebrews will rule us, just as we've been ruling them. Fight and don't be afraid."
1 Samuel,4,10,"The Philistines did fight. They killed thirty thousand Israelite soldiers, and all the rest ran off to their homes."
1 Samuel,4,11,"Hophni and Phinehas were killed, and the sacred chest was captured."
1 Samuel,4,12,That same day a soldier from the tribe of Benjamin ran from the battlefront to Shiloh. He had torn his clothes and put earth on his head to show his sorrow.
1 Samuel,4,13,"He went into town and told the news about the battle, and everyone started crying. Eli was afraid that something might happen to the sacred chest. So he was sitting on his chair beside the road, just waiting."
1 Samuel,5,1,The Philistines took the sacred chest from near Ebenezer to the town of Ashdod.
1 Samuel,5,2,"They brought it into the temple of their god Dagon and put it next to the statue of Dagon, which they worshipped."
1 Samuel,5,3,"When the people of Ashdod got up early the next morning, they found the statue lying face down on the floor in front of the sacred chest. They put the statue back where it belonged."
1 Samuel,5,4,"But early the next morning, it had fallen over again and was lying face down on the floor in front of the chest. The body of the statue was still in one piece, but its head and both hands had broken off and were lying on the stone floor in the doorway."
1 Samuel,5,5,This is the reason the priests and everyone else step over that part of the doorway when they enter the temple of Dagon in Ashdod.
1 Samuel,5,6,"The LORD caused a lot of trouble for the people of Ashdod and their neighbours. He made sores break out all over their bodies, and everyone was in a panic."
1 Samuel,5,7,"Finally, they said, “The God of Israel did this. He is the one who caused all this trouble for us and our god Dagon. We've got to get rid of this chest.”"
1 Samuel,5,8,"The people of Ashdod called all the Philistine rulers to Ashdod, and they asked them, “What can we do with the sacred chest that belongs to the God of Israel?” “Send it to Gath,” the rulers answered. But after they took it there,"
1 Samuel,5,9,"the LORD made sores break out on everyone in town. The people of Gath were frightened,"
1 Samuel,5,10,"so they sent the sacred chest to Ekron. But before they could take it through the town gates, the people of Ekron started screaming, “They've brought the sacred chest that belongs to the God of Israel! It will kill us and our families too!”"
1 Samuel,5,11,"The people of Ekron called for another meeting of the Philistine rulers and told them, “Send this chest back where it belongs. Then it won't kill us.” Everyone was in a panic, because God was causing a lot of people to die,"
1 Samuel,5,12,and those who had survived were suffering from the sores. They all cried to their gods for help.
1 Samuel,6,1,"After the sacred chest had been in Philistia for seven months,"
1 Samuel,6,2,"the Philistines called in their priests and fortune-tellers, and asked, “What should we do with this sacred chest? Tell us how to send it back where it belongs!”"
1 Samuel,6,3,"“Don't send it back without a gift,” the priests and fortune-tellers answered. “Send along something to Israel's God to make up for taking the chest in the first place. Then you will be healed, and you will find out why the LORD was causing you so much trouble.”"
1 Samuel,6,4,"“What should we send?” the Philistines asked. The priests and fortune-tellers answered: There are five Philistine rulers, and they all have the same disease that you have."
1 Samuel,6,5,"So make five gold models of the sores and five gold models of the rats that are wiping out your crops. If you honour the God of Israel with this gift, perhaps he will stop causing trouble for you and your gods and your crops."
1 Samuel,6,6,"Don't be like the Egyptians and their king. They were stubborn, but when Israel's God had finished with them, they had to let Israel go."
1 Samuel,6,7,"Get a new cart and two cows that have young calves and that have never pulled a cart. Hitch the cows to the cart, but take the calves back to their barn."
1 Samuel,6,8,Then put the chest on the cart. Put the gold rats and sores into a bag and put it on the cart next to the chest. Then send it on its way.
1 Samuel,6,9,"Watch to see if the chest goes on up the road to the Israelite town of Beth-Shemesh. If it goes back to its own country, you will know that it was the LORD who made us suffer so badly. But if the chest doesn't go back to its own country, then the LORD had nothing to do with the disease that hit us—it was simply bad luck."
1 Samuel,6,10,"The Philistines followed their advice. They hitched up the two cows to the cart, but they kept their calves in a barn."
1 Samuel,6,11,"Then they put the chest on the cart, along with the bag that had the gold rats and sores in it."
1 Samuel,6,12,"The cows went straight up the road towards Beth-Shemesh, mooing as they went. The Philistine rulers followed them until they got close to Beth-Shemesh."
1 Samuel,6,13,"The people of Beth-Shemesh were harvesting their wheat in the valley. When they looked up and saw the chest, they were so happy that they stopped working and started celebrating."
1 Samuel,7,1,"The people of Kiriath-Jearim got the chest and took it to Abinadab's house, which was on a hill in their town. They chose his son Eleazar to take care of it,"
1 Samuel,7,2,and it stayed there for twenty years. During this time everyone in Israel was very sad and begged the LORD for help.
1 Samuel,7,3,"One day, Samuel told all the people of Israel, “If you really want to turn back to the LORD , then prove it. Get rid of your foreign idols, including the ones of the goddess Astarte. Turn to the LORD with all your heart and worship only him. Then he will rescue you from the Philistines.”"
1 Samuel,7,4,The people got rid of their idols of Baal and Astarte and began worshipping only the LORD.
1 Samuel,7,5,"Then Samuel said, “Tell everyone in Israel to meet together at Mizpah, and I will pray to the LORD for you.”"
1 Samuel,7,6,"The Israelites met together at Mizpah with Samuel as their leader. They drew water from the well and poured it out as an offering to the LORD . On that same day they went without eating to show their sorrow, and they confessed they had been unfaithful to the LORD."
1 Samuel,7,7,"When the Philistine rulers found out about the meeting at Mizpah, they sent an army there to attack the people of Israel. The Israelites were afraid when they heard that the Philistines were coming."
1 Samuel,7,8,“Don't stop praying!” they told Samuel. “Ask the LORD our God to rescue us.”
1 Samuel,9,1,"Kish was a wealthy man who belonged to the tribe of Benjamin. His father was Abiel, his grandfather was Zeror, his great-grandfather was Becorath, and his great-great-grandfather was Aphiah."
1 Samuel,9,2,"Kish had a son named Saul, who was better looking and more than a head taller than anyone else in all Israel."
1 Samuel,9,3,"Kish owned some donkeys, but they had run off. So he told Saul, “Take one of the servants and go and look for the donkeys.”"
1 Samuel,9,4,"Saul and the servant went through the hill country of Ephraim and the territory of Shalishah, but they could not find the donkeys. Then they went through the territories of Shaalim and Benjamin, but still there was no sign of the donkeys."
1 Samuel,9,5,"Finally they came to the territory where the clan of Zuph lived. “Let's go back home,” Saul told his servant. “If we don't go back soon, my father will stop worrying about the donkeys and start worrying about us!”"
1 Samuel,9,6,“Wait!” the servant answered. “There's a man of God who lives in a town near here. He's amazing! Everything he says comes true. Let's talk to him. Perhaps he can tell us where to look.”
1 Samuel,9,7,"Saul said, “How can we talk to the prophet when I don't have anything to give him? We don't even have any bread left in our sacks. What can we give him?”"
1 Samuel,9,8,"“I have a small piece of silver,” the servant answered. “We can give him that, and then he will tell us where to look for the donkeys.”"
1 Samuel,10,1,Samuel took a small jar of olive oil and poured it on Saul's head. Then he kissed Saul and told him: The LORD has chosen you to be the leader and ruler of his people.
1 Samuel,10,2,"When you leave me today, you'll meet two men near Rachel's tomb at Zelzah in the territory of Benjamin. They'll tell you, “The donkeys you've been looking for have been found. Your father has forgotten about them, and now he's worrying about you! He's wondering how he can find you.”"
1 Samuel,10,3,"Go on from there until you reach the big oak tree at Tabor, where you'll meet three men on their way to worship God at Bethel. One of them will be leading three young goats, another will be carrying three round loaves of bread, and the last one will be carrying a clay jar of wine."
1 Samuel,10,4,"After they greet you, they'll give you two loaves of bread."
1 Samuel,10,5,"Next, go to Gibeah, where the Philistines have an army camp. As you're going into the town, you'll meet a group of prophets coming down from the place of worship. They'll be going along prophesying while others are walking in front of them, playing small harps, small drums, and flutes."
1 Samuel,10,6,The Spirit of the LORD will suddenly take control of you. You'll become a different person and start prophesying along with them.
1 Samuel,10,7,"After these things happen, do whatever you think is right! God will help you."
1 Samuel,10,8,"Then you should go to Gilgal. I'll come a little later, so wait for me. It may even take a week for me to get there, but when I come, I'll offer sacrifices and offerings to the LORD . I'll also tell you what to do next."
1 Samuel,10,9,"As Saul turned around to leave Samuel, God made Saul feel like a different person. That same day, everything happened just as Samuel had said."
1 Samuel,10,10,"When Saul arrived at Gibeah, a group of prophets met him. The Spirit of God suddenly took control of him, and there in the middle of the group he began prophesying."
1 Samuel,10,11,"Some people who had known Saul for a long time saw that he was speaking and behaving like a prophet. They said to each other, “What's happened? How can Saul be a prophet?”"
1 Samuel,10,12,"“Why not?” one of them answered. “Saul has as much right to be a prophet as anyone else!” That's why everyone started saying, “How can Saul be a prophet?”"
1 Samuel,10,13,"After Saul stopped prophesying, he went to the place of worship."
1 Samuel,10,14,"Later, Saul's uncle asked him, “Where have you been?” Saul answered, “Looking for the donkeys. We couldn't find them, so we went to talk with Samuel.”"
1 Samuel,10,15,“And what did he tell you?” Saul's uncle asked.
1 Samuel,10,16,"Saul answered, “He told us the donkeys had been found.” But Saul didn't mention that Samuel had chosen him to be king."
1 Samuel,10,17,Samuel sent messengers to tell the Israelites to come to Mizpah and meet with the LORD.
1 Samuel,10,18,"When everyone had arrived, Samuel said: The LORD God of Israel told me to remind you that he had rescued you from the Egyptians and from the other nations that abused you."
1 Samuel,10,19,God has rescued you from your troubles and hard times. But you have rejected your God and have asked for a king. Now each tribe and clan must come near the place of worship so the LORD can choose a king.
1 Samuel,10,20,"Samuel brought each tribe, one after the other, to the altar, and the LORD chose the Benjamin tribe."
1 Samuel,10,21,"Next, Samuel brought each clan of Benjamin there, and the LORD chose the Matri clan. Finally, Saul the son of Kish was chosen. But when they looked for him, he was nowhere to be found."
1 Samuel,10,22,"The people prayed, “Our LORD , is Saul here?” “Yes,” the LORD answered, “he is hiding behind the baggage.”"
1 Samuel,10,23,The people ran and got Saul and brought him into the middle of the crowd. He was more than a head taller than anyone else.
1 Samuel,10,24,"“Look closely at the man the LORD has chosen!” Samuel told the crowd. “There is no one like him!” The crowd shouted, “Long live the king!”"
1 Samuel,10,25,Samuel explained the rights and duties of a king and wrote them all in a book. He put the book in a temple building at one of the places where the LORD was worshipped. Then Samuel sent everyone home.
1 Samuel,10,26,"God had encouraged some young men to become followers of Saul, and when he returned to his home town of Gibeah, they went with him."
1 Samuel,10,27,"But some worthless fools said, “How can someone like Saul rescue us from our enemies?” They did not want Saul to be their king, and so they didn't bring him any gifts. But Saul kept calm."
1 Samuel,11,1,"About this time, King Nahash of Ammon came with his army and surrounded the town of Jabesh in Gilead. The people who lived there told Nahash, “If you will sign a peace treaty with us, you can be our ruler, and we will pay taxes to you.”"
1 Samuel,11,2,"Nahash answered, “Certainly, I'll sign a treaty! But not before I insult Israel by putting out the right eye of every man who lives in Jabesh.”"
1 Samuel,11,3,"The town leaders said, “Give us seven days so we can send messengers everywhere in Israel to ask for help. If no one comes here to save us, we will surrender to you.”"
1 Samuel,11,4,"Some of the messengers went to Gibeah, Saul's home town. They told what was happening at Jabesh, and everyone in Gibeah started crying."
1 Samuel,11,5,"Just then, Saul came in from the fields, walking behind his oxen. “Why is everyone crying?” Saul asked. They told him what the men from Jabesh had said."
1 Samuel,11,6,Then the Spirit of God suddenly took control of Saul and made him furious.
1 Samuel,11,7,"Saul killed two of his oxen, cut them up in pieces, and gave the pieces to the messengers. He told them to show the pieces to everyone in Israel and say, “Saul and Samuel are getting an army together. Come and join them. If you don't, this is what will happen to your oxen!” The LORD made the people of Israel terribly afraid. So all the men came together"
1 Samuel,11,8,at Bezek. Saul had them organized and counted. There were three hundred thousand from Israel and thirty thousand from Judah.
1 Samuel,11,9,Saul and his officers sent the messengers back to Jabesh with this promise: “We will rescue you tomorrow afternoon.” The messengers went back to the people at Jabesh and told them that they were going to be rescued. Everyone was encouraged!
1 Samuel,11,10,"So they told the Ammonites, “We will surrender to you tomorrow, and then you can do whatever you want to.”"
1 Samuel,11,11,"The next day, Saul divided his army into three groups and attacked before daylight. They started killing Ammonites and kept it up until afternoon. A few Ammonites managed to escape, but they were scattered far from each other."
1 Samuel,11,12,"The Israelite soldiers went to Samuel and demanded, “Where are the men who said they didn't want Saul to be king? Bring them to us, and we will put them to death!”"
1 Samuel,11,13,"“No you won't!” Saul told them. “The LORD rescued Israel today, and no one will be put to death.”"
1 Samuel,11,14,“Come on!” Samuel said. “Let's go to Gilgal and make an agreement that Saul will continue to be our king.”
1 Samuel,11,15,"Everyone went to the place of worship at Gilgal, where they agreed that Saul would be their king. Saul and the people sacrificed animals to ask for the LORD 's blessing, and they had a big celebration."
1 Samuel,12,1,"Samuel told the Israelites: I have given you a king, just as you asked."
1 Samuel,12,2,"You have seen how I have led you ever since I was a young man. I'm already old. My hair is grey, and my own sons are grown up. Now you must see how well your king will lead you."
1 Samuel,12,3,"Let me ask this. Have I ever taken anyone's ox or donkey or forced you to give me anything? Have I ever hurt anyone or taken a bribe to give an unfair decision? Answer me so the LORD and his chosen king can hear you. And if I have done any of these things, I will give it all back."
1 Samuel,12,4,"“No,” the Israelites answered. “You've never cheated us in any way!”"
1 Samuel,12,5,"Samuel said, “The LORD and his chosen king are witnesses to what you have said.” “That's true,” they replied."
1 Samuel,12,6,Then Samuel told them: The LORD brought your ancestors out of Egypt and chose Moses and Aaron to be your leaders.
1 Samuel,12,7,"Now the LORD will be your judge. So stand here and listen, while I remind you how often the LORD has saved you and your ancestors from your enemies."
1 Samuel,12,8,"After Jacob went to Egypt, your ancestors cried out to the LORD for help, and he sent Moses and Aaron. They led your ancestors out of Egypt and settled them in this land."
1 Samuel,12,9,"But your ancestors forgot the LORD , so he let them be defeated by the Philistines, the king of Moab, and Sisera, the commander of Hazor's army."
1 Samuel,12,10,"Again your ancestors cried out to the LORD for help. They said, “We have sinned! We stopped worshipping you, our LORD , and started worshipping Baal and Astarte. But now, if you rescue us from our enemies, we will worship you.”"
1 Samuel,12,11,"The LORD sent Gideon, Bedan, Jephthah, and Samuel to rescue you from your enemies, and you didn't have to worry about being attacked."
1 Samuel,12,12,"Then you saw that King Nahash of Ammon was going to attack you. And even though the LORD your God is your king, you told me, “This time it's different. We want a king to rule us!”"
1 Samuel,12,13,"You asked for a king, and you chose one. Now he stands here where all of you can see him. But it was really the LORD who made him your king."
1 Samuel,12,14,"If you and your king want to be followers of the LORD , you must worship him and do what he says. Don't be stubborn!"
1 Samuel,12,15,"If you're stubborn and refuse to obey the LORD , he will turn against you and your king."
1 Samuel,12,16,Just stand here and watch the LORD show his mighty power.
1 Samuel,12,17,"Isn't this the dry season? I'm going to ask the LORD to send a thunderstorm. When you see it, you will realize how wrong you were to ask for a king."
1 Samuel,12,18,"Samuel prayed, and that same day the LORD sent a thunderstorm. Everyone was afraid of the LORD and of Samuel."
1 Samuel,12,19,"They told Samuel, “Please, pray to the LORD your God for us! We don't want to die. We have sinned many times in the past, and we were very wrong to ask for a king.”"
1 Samuel,12,20,"Samuel answered: Even though what you did was wrong, you don't need to be afraid. But you must always follow the LORD and worship him with all your heart."
1 Samuel,12,21,"Don't worship idols! They don't have any power, and they can't help you or save you when you're in trouble."
1 Samuel,12,22,But the LORD has chosen you to be his own people. He will always take care of you so that everyone will know how great he is.
1 Samuel,12,23,I would be disobeying the LORD if I stopped praying for you! I will always teach you how to live right.
1 Samuel,12,24,You also must obey the LORD —you must worship him with all your heart and remember the great things he has done for you.
1 Samuel,12,25,"But if you and your king do evil, the LORD will wipe you out."
1 Samuel,13,1,"Saul was a young man when he became king, and he ruled Israel for two years."
1 Samuel,13,2,Then he chose three thousand men from Israel to be full-time soldiers and sent everyone else home. Two thousand of these troops stayed with him in the hills around Michmash and Bethel. The other thousand were stationed with Jonathan at Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin.
1 Samuel,13,3,"Jonathan led an attack on the Philistine army camp at Geba. The Philistine camp was destroyed, but the other Philistines heard what had happened. Then Saul told his messengers, “Go to every village in the country. Give a signal with the trumpet, and when the people come together, tell them what has happened.”"
1 Samuel,13,4,"The messengers then said to the people of Israel, “Saul has destroyed the Philistine army camp at Geba. Now the Philistines really hate Israel, so every town and village must send men to join Saul's army at Gilgal.”"
1 Samuel,13,5,"The Philistines called their army together to fight Israel. They had three thousand chariots, six thousand cavalry, and as many foot soldiers as there are grains of sand on the beach. They went to Michmash and set up camp there east of Beth-Aven."
1 Samuel,13,6,"The Israelite army realized that they were outnumbered and were going to lose the battle. Some of the Israelite men hid in caves or in clumps of bushes, and some ran to places where they could hide among large rocks. Others hid in tombs or in deep dry pits."
1 Samuel,13,7,"Still others went to Gad and Gilead on the other side of the River Jordan. Saul stayed at Gilgal. His soldiers were shaking with fear,"
1 Samuel,13,8,"and they were starting to run off and leave him. Saul waited there seven days, just as Samuel had ordered him to do, but Samuel did not come."
1 Samuel,13,9,"Finally, Saul commanded, “Bring me some animals, so we can offer sacrifices to please the LORD and ask for his help.” Saul killed one of the animals,"
1 Samuel,13,10,"and just as he was placing it on the altar, Samuel arrived. Saul went out to welcome him."
1 Samuel,13,11,"“What have you done?” Samuel asked. Saul answered, “My soldiers were leaving in all directions, and you didn't come when you were supposed to. The Philistines were gathering at Michmash,"
1 Samuel,13,12,"and I was worried that they would attack me here at Gilgal. I hadn't offered a sacrifice to ask for the LORD 's help, so I forced myself to offer a sacrifice on the altar fire.”"
1 Samuel,13,13,"“That was stupid!” Samuel said. “You didn't obey the LORD your God. If you had obeyed him, someone from your family would always have been king of Israel."
1 Samuel,13,14,"But no, you disobeyed, and so the LORD won't choose anyone else from your family to be king. In fact, he has already chosen the one he wants to be the next leader of his people.”"
1 Samuel,13,15,"Then Samuel left Gilgal. Part of Saul's army had not deserted him, and he led them to Gibeah in Benjamin to join his other troops. Then he counted them and found that he still had six hundred men."
1 Samuel,13,16,"Saul, Jonathan, and their army set up camp at Geba in Benjamin. The Philistine army was camped at Michmash."
1 Samuel,13,17,Each day they sent out patrols to attack and rob villages and then destroy them. One patrol would go north along the road to Ophrah in the region of Shual.
1 Samuel,13,18,Another patrol would go west along the road to Beth-Horon. A third patrol would go east towards the desert on the road to the ridge that overlooks Zeboim Valley.
1 Samuel,13,19,"The Philistines would not allow any Israelites to learn how to make iron tools. “If we allowed that,” they said, “those worthless Israelites would make swords and spears.”"
1 Samuel,15,1,"One day, Samuel told Saul: The LORD made me choose you to be king of his people, Israel. Now listen to this message from the LORD:"
1 Samuel,15,2,"“When the Israelites were on their way out of Egypt, the nation of Amalek attacked them. I am the LORD All-Powerful, and now I am going to make Amalek pay!"
1 Samuel,15,3,"“Go and attack the Amalekites! Destroy them and all their possessions. Don't have any pity. Kill their men, women, children, and even their babies. Slaughter their cattle, sheep, camels, and donkeys.”"
1 Samuel,15,4,"Saul sent messengers who told every town and village to send men to join the army at Telaim. There were two hundred and ten thousand troops in all, and ten thousand of these were from Judah. Saul organized them,"
1 Samuel,15,5,"then led them to a valley near one of the towns in Amalek, where they got ready to make a surprise attack."
1 Samuel,15,6,"Some Kenites lived nearby, and Saul told them, “Your people were kind to our nation when we left Egypt, and I don't want you to get killed when I wipe out the Amalekites. Leave here and stay away from them.” The Kenites left,"
1 Samuel,15,7,"and Saul attacked the Amalekites from Havilah to Shur, which is just east of Egypt."
1 Samuel,15,8,Every Amalekite was killed except King Agag.
1 Samuel,15,9,"Saul and his army let Agag live, and they also spared the best sheep and cattle. They didn't want to destroy anything of value, so they only killed the animals that were worthless or weak."
1 Samuel,15,10,"The LORD told Samuel,"
1 Samuel,15,11,"“Saul has stopped obeying me, and I'm sorry that I made him king.” Samuel was angry, and he cried out in prayer to the LORD all night."
1 Samuel,15,12,"Early the next morning he went to talk with Saul. Someone told him, “Saul went to Carmel, where he had a monument built so everyone would remember his victory. Then he left for Gilgal.”"
1 Samuel,15,13,"Samuel finally caught up with Saul, and Saul told him, “I hope the LORD will bless you! I have done what the LORD told me.”"
1 Samuel,15,14,"“Then why,” Samuel asked, “do I hear sheep and cattle?”"
1 Samuel,15,15,"“The army took them from the Amalekites,” Saul explained. “They kept the best sheep and cattle, so they could sacrifice them to the LORD your God. But we destroyed everything else.”"
1 Samuel,15,16,"“Stop!” Samuel said. “Let me tell you what the LORD told me last night.” “All right,” Saul answered."
1 Samuel,15,17,"Samuel continued, “You may not think you're very important, but the LORD chose you to be king, and you are in charge of the tribes of Israel."
1 Samuel,15,18,"When the LORD sent you on this mission, he told you to wipe out those worthless Amalekites."
1 Samuel,15,19,Why didn't you listen to the LORD ? Why did you keep the animals and make him angry?”
1 Samuel,15,20,"“But I did listen to the LORD !” Saul answered. “He sent me on a mission, and I went. I captured King Agag and destroyed his nation."
1 Samuel,15,21,All the animals were going to be destroyed anyway. That's why the army brought the best sheep and cattle to Gilgal as sacrifices to the LORD your God.”
1 Samuel,15,22,"“Tell me,” Samuel said. “Does the LORD really want sacrifices and offerings? No! He doesn't want your sacrifices. He wants you to obey him."
1 Samuel,15,23,"Rebelling against God or disobeying him because you are proud is just as bad as worshipping idols or asking them for advice. You refused to do what God told you, so God has decided that you can't be king.”"
1 Samuel,15,24,"“I have sinned,” Saul admitted. “I disobeyed both you and the LORD . I was afraid of the army, and I listened to them instead."
1 Samuel,15,25,Please forgive me and come back with me so I can worship the LORD .”
1 Samuel,15,26,"“No!” Samuel replied, “You disobeyed the LORD , and I won't go back with you. Now the LORD has said that you can't be king of Israel any longer.”"
1 Samuel,15,27,"As Samuel turned to go, Saul grabbed the edge of Samuel's robe. It tore!"
1 Samuel,15,28,"Samuel said, “The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel away from you today, and he will give it to someone who is better than you."
1 Samuel,15,29,"Besides, the eternal God of Israel isn't a human being. He doesn't tell lies or change his mind.”"
1 Samuel,15,30,"Saul said, “I did sin, but please honour me in front of the leaders of the army and the people of Israel. Come back with me, so I can worship the LORD your God.”"
1 Samuel,15,31,"Samuel followed Saul back, and Saul worshipped the LORD."
1 Samuel,15,32,"Then Samuel shouted, “Bring me King Agag of Amalek!” Agag came in chains, and he was saying to himself, “Surely they won't kill me now.”"
1 Samuel,15,33,"But Samuel said, “Agag, you have snatched children from their mothers' arms and killed them. Now your mother will be without children.” Then Samuel chopped Agag to pieces at the place of worship in Gilgal."
1 Samuel,15,34,"Samuel went home to Ramah, and Saul returned to his home in Gibeah."
1 Samuel,15,35,"Even though Samuel felt sad about Saul, Samuel never saw him again. The LORD was sorry he had made Saul the king of Israel."
1 Samuel,16,1,"One day he said, “Samuel, I've rejected Saul, and I refuse to let him be king any longer. Stop feeling sad about him. Put some olive oil in a small container and go and visit a man named Jesse, who lives in Bethlehem. I've chosen one of his sons to be my king.”"
1 Samuel,16,2,"Samuel answered, “If I do that, Saul will find out and have me killed.” “Take a calf with you,” the LORD replied. “Tell everyone that you've come to offer it as a sacrifice to me,"
1 Samuel,16,3,"then invite Jesse to the sacrifice. When I show you which one of his sons I have chosen, pour the olive oil on his head.”"
1 Samuel,16,4,"Samuel did what the LORD told him and went to Bethlehem. The town leaders went to meet him, but they were terribly afraid and asked, “Is this a friendly visit?”"
1 Samuel,16,5,"“Yes, it is!” Samuel answered. “I've come to offer a sacrifice to the LORD . Get yourselves ready to take part in the sacrifice and come with me.” Samuel also invited Jesse and his sons to come to the sacrifice, and he got them ready to take part."
1 Samuel,16,6,"When Jesse and his sons arrived, Samuel noticed Jesse's eldest son, Eliab. “He must be the one the LORD has chosen,” Samuel said to himself."
1 Samuel,16,7,"But the LORD told him, “Samuel, don't think Eliab is the one just because he's tall and handsome. He isn't the one I've chosen. People judge others by what they look like, but I judge people by what is in their hearts.”"
1 Samuel,16,8,"Jesse told his son Abinadab to go over to Samuel, but Samuel said, “No, the LORD hasn't chosen him.”"
1 Samuel,16,9,"Next, Jesse sent his son Shammah to him, and Samuel said, “The LORD hasn't chosen him either.”"
1 Samuel,16,10,"Jesse sent all seven of his sons over to Samuel. Finally, Samuel said, “Jesse, the LORD hasn't chosen any of these young men."
1 Samuel,16,11,"Do you have any more sons?” “Yes,” Jesse answered. “My youngest son David is out taking care of the sheep.” “Send for him!” Samuel said. “We won't start the ceremony until he gets here.”"
1 Samuel,16,12,"Jesse sent for David. He was a healthy, good-looking boy with a sparkle in his eyes. As soon as David came, the LORD told Samuel, “He's the one! Get up and pour the olive oil on his head.”"
1 Samuel,16,13,"Samuel poured the oil on David's head while his brothers watched. At that moment, the Spirit of the LORD took control of David and stayed with him from then on. Samuel returned home to Ramah."
1 Samuel,16,14,"The Spirit of the LORD had left Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD was terrifying him."
1 Samuel,16,15,"“It's an evil spirit from God that's frightening you,” Saul's officials told him."
1 Samuel,16,16,"“Your Majesty, let us go and look for someone who is good at playing the harp. He can play for you whenever the evil spirit from God bothers you, and you'll feel better.”"
1 Samuel,16,17,"“All right,” Saul answered. “Find me someone who is good at playing the harp and bring him here.”"
1 Samuel,16,18,"“A man named Jesse who lives in Bethlehem has a son who can play the harp,” one official said. “He's a brave warrior, he's good-looking, he can speak well, and the LORD is with him.”"
1 Samuel,16,19,Saul sent a message to Jesse: “Tell your son David to leave your sheep and come here to me.”
1 Samuel,16,20,"Jesse loaded a donkey with bread and a goatskin full of wine, then he told David to take the donkey and a young goat to Saul."
1 Samuel,16,21,David went to Saul and started working for him. Saul liked him so much that he put David in charge of carrying his weapons.
1 Samuel,16,22,"Not long after this, Saul sent another message to Jesse: “I really like David. Please let him stay with me.”"
1 Samuel,16,23,"Whenever the evil spirit from God bothered Saul, David would play his harp. Saul would relax and feel better, and the evil spirit would go away."
1 Samuel,17,1,"The Philistines got ready for war and brought their troops together to attack the town of Socoh in Judah. They set up camp at Ephes-Dammim, between Socoh and Azekah."
1 Samuel,18,1,"David and Saul finished talking, and soon David and Jonathan became best friends. Jonathan thought as much of David as he did of himself."
1 Samuel,18,2,"From that time on, Saul kept David in his service and would not let David go back to his own family."
1 Samuel,18,3,Jonathan liked David so much that they promised they would always be loyal friends.
1 Samuel,18,4,"Jonathan took off the robe that he was wearing and gave it to David. He also gave him his military clothes, his sword, his bow and arrows, and his belt."
1 Samuel,18,5,"David was a success in everything that Saul sent him to do, and Saul made him a high officer in his army. That pleased everyone, including Saul's other officers."
1 Samuel,18,6,"David had killed Goliath, the battle was over, and the Israelite army set out for home. As the army went along, women came out of each Israelite town to welcome King Saul. They were singing happy songs and dancing to the music of tambourines and harps."
1 Samuel,18,7,They sang: Saul has killed a thousand enemies; David has killed ten thousand enemies!
1 Samuel,18,8,"This song made Saul very angry, and he thought, “They are saying that David has killed ten times more enemies than I ever did. Next they will want to make him king.”"
1 Samuel,18,9,Saul never again trusted David.
1 Samuel,18,10,"The next day the LORD let an evil spirit take control of Saul, and he began acting like a mad man inside his house. David came to play the harp for Saul as usual, but this time Saul had a spear in his hand."
1 Samuel,18,11,"Saul thought, “I'll pin David to the wall.” He threw the spear at David twice, but David dodged and got away both times."
1 Samuel,18,12,"Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was helping David and was no longer helping him."
1 Samuel,18,13,Saul put David in charge of a thousand soldiers and sent him out to fight.
1 Samuel,18,14,"The LORD helped David, and he and his soldiers always won their battles."
1 Samuel,18,15,This made Saul even more afraid of David.
1 Samuel,18,16,"But everyone else in Judah and Israel was loyal to David, because he led the army in battle."
1 Samuel,18,17,"One day, Saul told David, “If you'll be brave and fight the LORD 's battles for me, I'll let you marry my eldest daughter Merab.” But Saul was really thinking, “I don't want to kill David myself, so I'll let the Philistines do it for me.”"
1 Samuel,18,18,"David answered, “How could I possibly marry your daughter? I'm not very important, and neither is my family.”"
1 Samuel,18,19,"But when the time came for David to marry Saul's daughter Merab, Saul told her to marry Adriel from the town of Meholah."
1 Samuel,18,20,"Saul had another daughter. Her name was Michal, and Saul found out that she was in love with David. This made Saul happy,"
1 Samuel,18,21,"and he thought, “I'll tell David he can marry Michal, but I'll set it up so that the Philistines will kill him.” He told David, “I'm going to give you a second chance to marry one of my daughters.”"
1 Samuel,19,1,"One day, Saul told his son Jonathan and his officers to kill David. But Jonathan liked David a lot,"
1 Samuel,20,1,"David escaped from Prophets Village. Then he ran to see Jonathan and asked, “Why does your father Saul want to kill me? What have I done wrong?”"
1 Samuel,20,2,“My father can't be trying to kill you! He never does anything without telling me about it. Why would he hide this from me? It can't be true!”
1 Samuel,20,3,"“Jonathan, I swear it's true! But your father knows how much you like me, and he didn't want to break your heart. That's why he didn't tell you. I swear by the living LORD and by your own life that I'm only one step ahead of death.”"
1 Samuel,20,4,"Then Jonathan said, “Tell me what to do, and I'll do it.”"
1 Samuel,20,5,"David answered: Tomorrow is the New Moon Festival, and I'm supposed to have dinner with your father. But instead, I'll hide in a field until the evening of the next day."
1 Samuel,20,6,"If Saul wonders where I am, tell him, “David asked me to let him go to his home town of Bethlehem, so he could take part in a sacrifice his family makes there every year.”"
1 Samuel,20,7,"If your father says it's all right, then I'm safe. But if he gets angry, you'll know he wants to harm me."
1 Samuel,20,8,"Be kind to me. After all, it was your idea to promise the LORD that we would always be loyal friends. If I've done anything wrong, kill me yourself, but don't hand me over to your father."
1 Samuel,20,9,"“Don't worry,” Jonathan said. “If I find out that my father wants to kill you, I'll certainly let you know.”"
1 Samuel,20,10,“How will you do that?” David asked.
1 Samuel,20,11,"“Let's go out to this field, and I'll tell you,” Jonathan answered. When they got there,"
1 Samuel,20,12,"Jonathan said: I swear by the LORD God of Israel, that two days from now I'll know what my father is planning. Of course I'll let you know if he's friendly towards you."
1 Samuel,20,13,"But if he wants to harm you, I promise to tell you and help you escape. And I ask the LORD to punish me severely if I don't keep my promise. I pray that the LORD will bless you, just as he used to bless my father."
1 Samuel,21,1,"David went to see Ahimelech, a priest who lived in the town of Nob. Ahimelech was trembling with fear as he came out to meet David. “Why are you alone?” Ahimelech asked. “Why isn't anyone else with you?”"
1 Samuel,21,2,"“I'm on a mission for King Saul,” David answered. “He ordered me not to tell anyone what the mission is all about, so I told my soldiers to stay somewhere else."
1 Samuel,21,3,Do you have any food you can give me? Could you spare five loaves of bread?”
1 Samuel,21,4,"“The only bread I have is the sacred bread,” the priest told David. “You can have it if your soldiers didn't sleep with women last night.”"
1 Samuel,21,5,"“Of course we didn't sleep with women,” David answered. “I never let my men do that when we're on a mission. They have to be acceptable to worship God even when we're on an ordinary mission, and today we're on a special mission.”"
1 Samuel,21,6,The only bread the priest had was the sacred bread that he had taken from the place of worship after putting out the fresh loaves. So he gave it to David.
1 Samuel,21,7,"It so happened that one of Saul's officers was there, worshipping the LORD that day. His name was Doeg the Edomite, and he was the strongest of Saul's shepherds."
1 Samuel,21,8,"David asked Ahimelech, “Do you have a spear or a sword? I had to leave so quickly on this mission for the king that I didn't bring along my sword or any other weapons.”"
1 Samuel,21,9,"The priest answered, “The only sword here is the one that belonged to Goliath the Philistine. You were the one who killed him in Elah Valley, and so you can take his sword if you want to. It's wrapped in a cloth behind the statue.” “It's the best sword there is,” David said. “I'll take it!”"
1 Samuel,21,10,"David kept on running from Saul that day until he came to Gath, where he met with King Achish."
1 Samuel,21,11,"The officers of King Achish were also there, and they asked Achish, “Isn't David a king back in his own country? Don't the Israelites dance and sing, ‘Saul has killed a thousand enemies; David has killed ten thousand enemies’?”"
1 Samuel,21,12,"David thought about what they were saying, and it made him afraid of Achish."
1 Samuel,21,13,"So in front of everyone, he pretended to be insane. He acted confused and scratched on the doors of the town gate, while drooling in his beard."
1 Samuel,21,14,“Look at him!” Achish said to his officers. “You can see he's mad. Why did you bring him to me?
1 Samuel,21,15,I have enough mad people without your bringing another one here. Keep him away from my palace!”
1 Samuel,22,1,"When David escaped from the town of Gath, he went to Adullam Cave. His brothers and the rest of his family found out where he was, and they followed him there."
1 Samuel,22,2,"A lot of other people joined him too. Some were in trouble, others were angry or in debt, and David was soon the leader of four hundred men."
1 Samuel,22,3,"David left Adullam Cave and went to the town of Mizpeh in Moab, where he talked with the king of Moab. “Please,” David said, “let my father and mother stay with you until I find out what God will do with me.”"
1 Samuel,22,4,"So he brought his parents to the king of Moab, and they stayed with him while David was in hiding."
1 Samuel,22,5,"One day the prophet Gad told David, “Don't stay here! Go back to Judah.” David then left and went to Hereth Forest."
1 Samuel,22,6,"Saul was sitting under a small tree on top of the hill at Gibeah when he heard that David and his men had been seen. Saul was holding his spear, and his officers were standing in front of him."
1 Samuel,22,7,"He told them: Listen to me! You belong to the Benjamin tribe, so if that son of Jesse ever becomes king, he won't give you fields or vineyards. He won't make you officers in charge of thousands or hundreds as I have done."
1 Samuel,22,8,But you're all plotting against me! Not one of you told me that my own son Jonathan had made an agreement with him. Not one of you cared enough to tell me that Jonathan had helped one of my officers rebel. Now that son of Jesse is trying to ambush me.
1 Samuel,22,9,"Doeg the Edomite was standing with the other officers and spoke up, “When I was in the town of Nob, I saw that son of Jesse. He was visiting the priest Ahimelech the son of Ahitub."
1 Samuel,22,10,"Ahimelech talked to the LORD for him, then gave him food and the sword that had belonged to Goliath the Philistine.”"
1 Samuel,22,11,"Saul sent a message to Ahimelech and his whole family of priests at Nob, ordering them to come to him. When they came,"
1 Samuel,22,12,"Saul told them, “Listen to me, you son of Ahitub.” “Certainly, Your Majesty,” Ahimelech answered."
1 Samuel,22,13,"Saul demanded, “Why did you plot against me with that son of Jesse? You helped him rebel against me by giving him food and a sword, and by talking with God for him. Now he's trying to ambush me!”"
1 Samuel,22,14,"“Your Majesty, none of your officers is more loyal than David!” Ahimelech replied. “He's your son-in-law and the captain of your bodyguard. Everyone in your family respects him."
1 Samuel,22,15,"This isn't the first time I've talked with God for David, and it's never made you angry before! Please don't accuse me or my family like this. I have no idea what's going on!”"
1 Samuel,22,16,"“Ahimelech,” Saul said, “you and your whole family are going to die.”"
1 Samuel,22,17,"Saul shouted to his bodyguards, “These priests of the LORD helped David! They knew he was running away, but they didn't tell me. Kill them!” But the king's officers would not attack the priests of the LORD."
1 Samuel,22,18,"Saul turned to Doeg, who was from Edom, and said, “Kill the priests!” On that same day, Doeg killed eighty-five priests."
1 Samuel,22,19,"Then he attacked the town of Nob, where the priests had lived, and he killed everyone there—men, women, children, and babies. He even killed their cattle, donkeys, and sheep."
1 Samuel,22,20,Ahimelech's son Abiathar was the only one who escaped. He ran to David
1 Samuel,22,21,"and told him, “Saul has murdered the priests at Nob!”"
1 Samuel,22,22,"David answered, “That day when I saw Doeg, I knew he would tell Saul! Your family died because of me."
1 Samuel,22,23,Stay here. Isn't the same person trying to kill both of us? Don't worry! You'll be safe here with me.”
1 Samuel,23,1,"One day some people told David, “The Philistines keep attacking the town of Keilah and stealing grain from the threshing place.”"
1 Samuel,23,2,"David asked the LORD , “Should I attack these Philistines?” “Yes,” the LORD answered. “Attack them and rescue Keilah.”"
1 Samuel,23,3,"But David's men said, “Look, even here in Judah we're afraid of the Philistines. We will be terrified if we try to fight them at Keilah!”"
1 Samuel,23,4,"David asked the LORD about it again. “Leave at once,” the LORD answered. “I will give you victory over the Philistines at Keilah.”"
1 Samuel,23,5,"David and his men went there and fiercely attacked the Philistines. They killed many of them, then led away their cattle, and rescued the people of Keilah."
1 Samuel,24,1,"When Saul got back from fighting off the Philistines, he heard that David was in the desert around En-Gedi."
1 Samuel,24,2,Saul led three thousand of Israel's best soldiers out to look for David and his men near Wild Goat Rocks at En-Gedi.
1 Samuel,24,3,"There were some sheep pens along the side of the road, and one of them was built around the entrance to a cave. Saul went into the cave to relieve himself. David and his men were hiding at the back of the cave."
1 Samuel,24,4,"They whispered to David, “The LORD told you he was going to let you defeat your enemies and do whatever you want with them. This must be the day the LORD was talking about.” David sneaked over and cut off a small piece of Saul's robe, but Saul didn't notice a thing."
1 Samuel,24,5,"Afterwards, David was sorry that he had even done that,"
1 Samuel,25,1,"Samuel died, and people from all over Israel gathered to mourn for him when he was buried at his home in Ramah. Meanwhile, David moved his camp to Paran Desert."
1 Samuel,26,1,"Once again, some people from Ziph went to Gibeah to talk with Saul. “David has a hideout on Mount Hachilah near Jeshimon out in the desert,” they told him."
1 Samuel,26,2,Saul took three thousand of Israel's best soldiers and went to look for David there in Ziph Desert.
1 Samuel,26,3,"Saul set up camp on Mount Hachilah, which is across the road from Jeshimon. But David was hiding out in the desert. When David heard that Saul was following him,"
1 Samuel,26,4,he sent some spies to find out if it was true.
1 Samuel,26,5,"Then he sneaked up to Saul's camp. He noticed that Saul and his army commander Abner the son of Ner were sleeping in the middle of the camp, with soldiers sleeping all around them."
1 Samuel,26,6,"David asked Ahimelech the Hittite and Joab's brother Abishai, “Which one of you will go with me into Saul's camp?” “I will!” Abishai answered."
1 Samuel,26,7,"That same night, David and Abishai crept into the camp. Saul was sleeping, and his spear was stuck in the ground not far from his head. Abner and the soldiers were sound asleep all around him."
1 Samuel,26,8,"Abishai whispered, “This time God has let you get your hands on your enemy! I'll pin him to the ground with one thrust of his own spear.”"
1 Samuel,26,9,“Don't kill him!” David whispered back. “The LORD will punish anyone who kills his chosen king.
1 Samuel,26,10,"As surely as the LORD lives, the LORD will kill Saul, or Saul will die a natural death or be killed in battle."
1 Samuel,26,11,But I pray that the LORD will keep me from harming his chosen king. Let's grab his spear and his water jar and get out of here!”
1 Samuel,26,12,"David took the spear and the water jar, then left the camp. None of Saul's soldiers knew what had happened or even woke up—the LORD had made all of them fall sound asleep."
1 Samuel,26,13,"David and Abishai crossed the valley and went to the top of the next hill, where they were at a safe distance."
1 Samuel,26,14,“Abner!” David shouted towards Saul's army. “Can you hear me?” Abner shouted back. “Who dares disturb the king?”
1 Samuel,26,15,"“Abner, what kind of a man are you?” David replied. “Aren't you supposed to be the best soldier in Israel? Then why didn't you protect your king? Anyone who went into your camp could have killed him tonight."
1 Samuel,26,16,You're a complete failure! I swear by the living LORD that you and your men deserve to die for not protecting the LORD 's chosen king. Look and see if you can find the king's spear and the water jar that were near his head.”
1 Samuel,26,17,"Saul could tell it was David's voice, and he called out, “David, my son! Is that you?” “Yes it is, Your Majesty."
1 Samuel,26,18,"Why are you after me? Have I done something wrong, or have I committed a crime?"
1 Samuel,26,19,"Please listen to what I have to say. If the LORD has turned you against me, perhaps a sacrifice will make him change his mind. But if some people have turned you against me, I hope the LORD will punish them! They have forced me to leave the land that belongs to the LORD and have told me to worship foreign gods."
1 Samuel,26,20,Don't let me die in a land far away from the LORD . I'm no more important than a flea! Why should the king of Israel hunt me down as if I were a bird in the mountains?”
1 Samuel,26,21,"“David, you had the chance to kill me today. But you didn't. I was very wrong about you. It was a terrible mistake for me to try to kill you. I've acted like a fool, but I'll never try to harm you again. You're like a son to me, so please come back.”"
1 Samuel,26,22,"“Your Majesty, here's your spear! Let one of your soldiers come and get it."
1 Samuel,26,23,"The LORD put you in my power today, but you are his chosen king and I wouldn't harm you. The LORD rewards people who are faithful and live right."
1 Samuel,26,24,"I saved your life today, and I pray that the LORD will protect me and keep me safe.”"
1 Samuel,26,25,"“David, my son, I pray that the Lord will bless you and make you successful!” Saul went back home. David also left,"
1 Samuel,27,1,"but he thought to himself, “One of these days, Saul is going to kill me. The only way to escape from him is to go to Philistia. Then I'll be outside Israel, and Saul will give up trying to catch me.”"
1 Samuel,29,1,"The Philistines had brought their whole army to Aphek, while Israel's army was camping near Jezreel Spring."
1 Samuel,30,1,"It took David and his men three days to reach Ziklag. But while they had been away, the Amalekites had been raiding in the desert around there. They had attacked Ziklag, burnt it to the ground,"
1 Samuel,30,2,and had taken away the women and children.
1 Samuel,30,3,"When David and his men came to Ziklag, they saw the burnt out ruins and learnt that their families had been taken captive."
1 Samuel,30,4,They started crying and kept it up until they were too weak to cry any more.
1 Samuel,30,5,"David's two wives, Ahinoam and Abigail, had been taken captive with everyone else."
1 Samuel,30,6,"David was desperate. His soldiers were so upset over what had happened to their sons and daughters that they were thinking about stoning David to death. But he felt the LORD God giving him strength,"
1 Samuel,30,7,"and he said to the priest, “Abiathar, let's ask God what to do.” Abiathar brought everything he needed to get answers from God, and he went over to David."
1 Samuel,30,8,"Then David asked the LORD , “Should I go after the people who raided our town? Can I catch up with them?” “Go after them,” the LORD answered. “You will catch up with them, and you will rescue your families.”"
1 Samuel,31,1,"Meanwhile, the Philistines were fighting Israel at Mount Gilboa. Israel's soldiers ran from the Philistines, and many of them were killed."
1 Samuel,31,2,"The Philistines closed in on Saul and his sons, and they killed his sons Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua."
1 Samuel,31,3,"The fighting was fierce around Saul, and he was badly wounded by enemy arrows."
1 Samuel,31,4,"Saul told the soldier who carried his weapons, “Kill me with your sword! I don't want those worthless Philistines to torture me and make fun of me.” But the soldier was afraid to kill him. Saul then took out his own sword; he stuck the blade into his stomach, and fell on it."
1 Samuel,31,5,"When the soldier knew that Saul was dead, he killed himself in the same way."
1 Samuel,31,6,"Saul was dead, his three sons were dead, and the soldier who carried his weapons was dead. They and all his soldiers died on that same day."
1 Samuel,31,7,"The Israelites on the other side of Jezreel Valley and the other side of the Jordan learnt that Saul and his sons were dead. They saw that the Israelite army had run away. So they ran away too, and the Philistines moved into the towns the Israelites had left behind."
1 Samuel,31,8,"The day after the battle, when the Philistines returned to the battlefield to take the weapons of the dead Israelite soldiers, they found Saul and his three sons lying dead on Mount Gilboa."
