Leviticus,2,1,"When you offer sacrifices to give thanks to me, you must use only your finest flour. Put it in a dish, sprinkle olive oil and incense on the flour,"
Leviticus,2,2,"and take it to the priests from Aaron's family. One of them will scoop up the incense together with a handful of the flour and oil. Then, to show that the whole offering belongs to me, the priest will lay this part on the bronze altar and send it up in smoke with a smell that pleases me."
Leviticus,2,3,The rest of this sacrifice is for the priests; it is very holy because it was offered to me.
Leviticus,2,4,"If you bake bread in an oven for this sacrifice, use only your finest flour, but without any yeast. You may make the flour into a loaf mixed with olive oil, or you may make it into thin wafers and brush them with oil."
Leviticus,2,5,"If you cook bread in a shallow pan for this sacrifice, use only your finest flour. Mix it with olive oil, but do not use any yeast."
Leviticus,2,6,Then break the bread into small pieces and sprinkle them with oil.
Leviticus,2,7,"If you cook your bread in a pan with a lid on it, you must also use the finest flour mixed with oil."
Leviticus,2,8,"You may prepare sacrifices to give thanks in any of these three ways. Bring your sacrifice to a priest, and he will take it to the bronze altar."
Leviticus,2,9,"Then, to show that the whole offering belongs to me, the priest will lay part of it on the altar and send it up in smoke with a smell that pleases me."
Leviticus,2,10,The rest of this sacrifice is for the priests; it is very holy because it was offered to me.
Leviticus,2,11,"Yeast and honey must never be burnt on the altar, so don't ever mix either of these in a grain sacrifice."
Leviticus,2,12,"You may offer either of them separately, when you present the first part of your harvest to me, but they must never be burnt on the altar."
Leviticus,2,13,"Salt is offered when you make an agreement with me, so sprinkle salt on these sacrifices."
Leviticus,2,14,"Freshly cut grain, either roasted or coarsely ground, must be used when you offer the first part of your grain harvest."
Leviticus,2,15,"You must mix in some olive oil and put incense on top, because this is a grain sacrifice."
Leviticus,2,16,A priest will sprinkle all the incense and some of the grain and oil on the altar and send them up in smoke to show that the whole offering belongs to me.
Leviticus,3,1,"When you offer sacrifices to ask my blessing, you may offer either a bull or a cow, but there must be nothing wrong with the animal."
Leviticus,3,2,"Lead it to the entrance of the sacred tent, lay your hand on its head, and have it killed there. A priest from Aaron's family will splatter its blood against the four sides of the altar."
Leviticus,3,3,"Offer all the fat on the animal's insides,"
Leviticus,3,4,as well as the lower part of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat.
Leviticus,3,5,"Some of the priests will lay these pieces on the altar and send them up in smoke with a smell that pleases me, together with the sacrifice that is offered to please me."
Leviticus,3,6,"Instead of a bull or a cow, you may offer any sheep or goat that has nothing wrong with it."
Leviticus,3,7,"If you offer a sheep, you must present it to me at the entrance to the sacred tent."
Leviticus,3,8,Lay your hand on its head and have it killed there. A priest will then splatter its blood against the four sides of the altar.
Leviticus,3,9,"Offer the fat on the tail, the tailbone, and the insides,"
Leviticus,3,10,as well as the lower part of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat.
Leviticus,3,11,One of the priests will lay these pieces on the altar and send them up in smoke as a food offering for me.
Leviticus,3,12,"If you offer a goat, you must also present it to me"
Leviticus,3,13,at the entrance to the sacred tent. Lay your hand on its head and have it killed there. A priest will then splatter its blood against the four sides of the altar.
Leviticus,3,14,"Offer all the fat on the animal's insides,"
Leviticus,3,15,as well as the lower part of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat.
Leviticus,3,16,One of the priests will put these pieces on the altar and send them up in smoke as a food offering with a smell that pleases me. All fat belongs to me.
Leviticus,3,17,"So you and your descendants must never eat any fat or any blood, not even in the privacy of your own homes. This law will never change."
Leviticus,4,1,The LORD told Moses
Leviticus,4,2,to say to the community of Israel: Offer a sacrifice to ask forgiveness when you sin by accidentally doing something I have told you not to do.
Leviticus,4,3,"When the high priest sins, he makes everyone else guilty too. And so, he must sacrifice a young bull that has nothing wrong with it."
Leviticus,4,4,"The priest will lead the bull to the entrance of the sacred tent, lay his hand on its head, and kill it there."
Leviticus,4,5,"He will take a bowl of the blood inside the tent,"
Leviticus,4,6,"dip a finger in the blood, and sprinkle some of it seven times towards the sacred chest behind the curtain."
Leviticus,4,7,"Then, in my presence, he will smear some of the blood on each of the four corners of the incense altar, before pouring out the rest at the foot of the bronze altar near the entrance to the tent."
Leviticus,5,1,"If you refuse to testify in court about something you saw or know has happened, you have sinned and can be punished."
Leviticus,5,2,"You are guilty and unfit to worship me, if you accidentally touch the dead body of any kind of unclean animal."
Leviticus,5,3,You are guilty if you find out that you have accidentally touched any waste that comes from a human body.
Leviticus,5,4,You are guilty the moment you realize that you have made a hasty promise to do something good or bad.
Leviticus,5,5,"As soon as you discover that you have committed any of these sins, you must confess what you have done."
Leviticus,5,6,"Then you must bring a female sheep or goat to me as the price for your sin. A priest will sacrifice the animal, and you will be forgiven."
Leviticus,5,7,"If you are poor and cannot afford to bring an animal, you may bring two doves or two pigeons. One of these will be a sacrifice to ask my forgiveness, and the other will be a sacrifice to please me."
Leviticus,5,8,"Give both birds to the priest, who will offer one as a sacrifice to ask my forgiveness. He will wring its neck without tearing off its head,"
Leviticus,5,9,"splatter some of its blood on one side of the bronze altar, and drain out the rest at the foot of the altar."
Leviticus,5,10,Then he will follow the proper rules for offering the other bird as a sacrifice to please me. You will be forgiven when the priest offers these sacrifices as the price for your sin.
Leviticus,5,11,"If you are so poor that you cannot afford doves or pigeons, you may bring one kilogramme of your finest flour. This is a sacrifice to ask my forgiveness, so don't sprinkle olive oil or sweet-smelling incense on it."
Leviticus,5,12,"Give the flour to a priest, who will scoop up a handful and send it up in smoke together with the other offerings. This is a reminder that all the flour belongs to me."
Leviticus,5,13,"By offering this sacrifice, the priest pays the price for any of these sins you may have committed. The priest gets the rest of the flour, just as he does with grain sacrifices."
Leviticus,7,1,The sacrifice to make things right is very sacred.
Leviticus,7,2,"The animal must be killed in the same place where the sacrifice to please me is killed, and the animal's blood must be splattered against the four sides of the bronze altar."
Leviticus,7,3,"Offer all the animal's fat, including the fat on its tail and on its insides,"
Leviticus,7,4,as well as the lower part of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat.
Leviticus,7,5,One of the priests will lay these pieces on the altar and send them up in smoke to me.
Leviticus,7,6,"This sacrifice for making things right is very holy. Only the priests may eat it, and they must eat it in a holy place."
Leviticus,7,7,"The ceremony for this sacrifice and the one for sin are alike, and the meat may be eaten only by the priest who performs this ceremony of forgiveness."
Leviticus,7,8,"In fact, the priest who offers a sacrifice to please me may keep the skin of the animal,"
Leviticus,7,9,just as he may eat the bread from a sacrifice to give thanks to me.
Leviticus,7,10,All other grain sacrifices—with or without olive oil in them—are to be divided equally among the priests of Aaron's family.
Leviticus,7,11,Here are the instructions for offering a sacrifice to ask my blessing:
Leviticus,7,12,"If you offer it to give thanks, you must offer some bread together with it. Use the finest flour to make three kinds of bread without yeast—two in the form of loaves mixed with olive oil and one in the form of thin wafers brushed with oil."
Leviticus,7,13,You must also make some bread with yeast.
Leviticus,7,14,"Give me one loaf or wafer from each of these four kinds of bread, after which they will belong to the priest who splattered the blood against the bronze altar."
Leviticus,7,15,"When you offer an animal to ask a blessing from me or to thank me, the meat belongs to you, but it must be eaten the same day."
Leviticus,7,16,"It is different with the sacrifices you offer when you make me a promise or voluntarily give me something. The meat from those sacrifices may be kept and eaten the next day,"
Leviticus,8,1,The LORD said to Moses:
Leviticus,8,2,"Send for Aaron and his sons, as well as their priestly clothes, the oil for ordination, the bull for the sin offering, the two rams, and a basket of bread made without yeast."
Leviticus,8,3,Then bring the whole community of Israel together at the entrance to the sacred tent.
Leviticus,8,4,"Moses obeyed the LORD , and when everyone had come together,"
Leviticus,8,5,"he said, “We are here to follow the LORD 's instructions.”"
Leviticus,8,6,"After Moses told Aaron and his sons to step forward, he made them wash themselves."
Leviticus,8,7,He put the priestly shirt and robe on Aaron and wrapped the sash around his waist. Then he put the sacred apron on Aaron and fastened it with the finely woven belt.
Leviticus,8,8,"Next, he put on Aaron the sacred breastpiece that was used in learning what the LORD wanted his people to do."
Leviticus,8,9,"He placed the turban on Aaron's head, and on the front of the turban was the narrow strip of thin gold as a sign of his dedication to the LORD."
Leviticus,8,10,Moses then dedicated the sacred tent and everything in it to the LORD by sprinkling them with some of the oil for ordination.
Leviticus,8,11,"He sprinkled the bronze altar seven times, and he sprinkled its equipment, as well as the large bronze bowl and its base."
Leviticus,8,12,He also poured some of the oil on Aaron's head to dedicate him to the LORD.
Leviticus,8,13,"At last, Moses dressed Aaron's sons in their shirts, then tied sashes around them and put special caps on them, just as the LORD had commanded."
Leviticus,8,14,"Moses led out the bull that was to be sacrificed for sin, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head."
Leviticus,8,15,"After it was killed, Moses dipped a finger in the blood and smeared some of it on each of the four corners of the bronze altar, before pouring out the rest at the foot of the altar. This purified the altar and made it a fit place for offering the sacrifice for sin."
Leviticus,8,16,"Moses then took the fat on the bull's insides, as well as the lower part of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat, and sent them up in smoke on the altar fire."
Leviticus,8,17,"Finally, he took the skin and the flesh of the bull, together with the food still in its stomach, and burnt them outside the camp, just as the LORD had commanded."
Leviticus,8,18,"Moses led out the ram for the sacrifice to please the LORD. After Aaron and his sons had laid their hands on its head,"
Leviticus,8,19,Moses killed the ram and splattered its blood against the four sides of the altar.
Leviticus,9,1,"Eight days later Moses called together Aaron, his sons, and Israel's leaders."
Leviticus,9,2,Then he said to Aaron: Find a young bull and a ram that have nothing wrong with them. Offer the bull to the LORD as a sacrifice for sin and the ram as a sacrifice to please him.
Leviticus,9,3,"Tell the people of Israel that they must offer sacrifices as well. They must offer a goat as a sacrifice for sin, and a bull and a ram as a sacrifice to please the LORD . The bull and the ram must be a year old and have nothing wrong with them."
Leviticus,9,4,"Then the people must offer a bull and a ram as a sacrifice to ask the LORD 's blessing and also a grain sacrifice mixed with oil. Do this, because the LORD will appear to you today."
Leviticus,9,5,"After the animals and the grain had been brought to the front of the sacred tent, and the people were standing there in the presence of the LORD,"
Leviticus,9,6,"Moses said: The LORD has ordered you to do this, so that he may appear to you in all his glory."
Leviticus,9,7,"Aaron, step up to the altar and offer the sacrifice to please the LORD , then offer the sacrifices for the forgiveness of your sins and for the sins of the people, just as the LORD has commanded."
Leviticus,9,8,Aaron stepped up to the altar and killed the bull that was to be the sacrifice for his sins.
Leviticus,9,9,"His sons brought him the blood. He dipped a finger in it, smeared some on the four corners of the bronze altar, and poured out the rest at its foot."
Leviticus,9,10,"But he sent up in smoke the fat, the kidneys, and the lower part of the liver, just as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Leviticus,9,11,Then Aaron burnt the skin and the flesh outside the camp.
Leviticus,9,12,"After Aaron had killed the ram that was sacrificed to please the LORD , Aaron's sons brought him the blood, and he splattered it against all four sides of the altar."
Leviticus,9,13,"They brought him each piece of the animal, including the head, and he burnt them all on the altar."
Leviticus,9,14,He washed the insides and the hind legs and also sent them up in smoke.
Leviticus,9,15,"Next, Aaron sacrificed the goat for the sins of the people, as he had done with the sacrifice for his own sins."
Leviticus,9,16,"And so, he burnt this sacrifice on the altar in the proper way."
Leviticus,9,17,He also presented the grain sacrifice and burnt a handful of the flour on the altar as part of the morning sacrifice.
Leviticus,9,18,"At last, he killed the bull and the ram as a sacrifice to ask the LORD 's blessing on the people. Aaron's sons brought him the blood, and he splattered it against the four sides of the altar."
Leviticus,9,19,"His sons placed all the fat, as well as the kidneys and the lower part of the liver"
Leviticus,9,20,on top of the choice ribs.
Leviticus,9,21,Then Aaron burnt the fat on the altar and lifted up the ribs and the right hind leg to show that these were dedicated to the LORD . This was done just as the LORD had instructed Moses.
Leviticus,9,22,"Aaron held out his hand and gave the people his blessing, before coming down from the bronze altar where he had offered the sacrifices."
Leviticus,9,23,"He and Moses went into the sacred tent, and when they came out, they gave the people their blessing. Then the LORD appeared to the people in all his glory."
Leviticus,9,24,"The LORD sent fiery flames that burnt up everything on the altar, and when everyone saw this, they shouted and fell to their knees to worship the LORD."
Leviticus,10,1,"Nadab and Abihu were two of Aaron's sons, but they disobeyed the LORD by burning incense to him on a fire pan, when they were not supposed to."
Leviticus,10,2,Suddenly the LORD sent fiery flames and burnt them to death.
Leviticus,10,3,"Then Moses told Aaron that this was exactly what the LORD had meant when he said: “I demand respect from my priests, and I will be praised by everyone!” Aaron was speechless."
Leviticus,10,4,"Moses sent for Mishael and Elzaphan, the two sons of Aaron's uncle Uzziel. Then he told them, “Take these two dead relatives of yours outside the camp far from the entrance to the sacred tent.”"
Leviticus,10,5,So they dragged the dead men away by their clothes.
Leviticus,10,6,"Then Moses told Aaron and his other two sons, Eleazar and Ithamar: Don't show your sorrow by leaving your hair uncombed and tearing your priestly clothes, or the LORD will get angry. He will kill the three of you and punish everyone else. It's all right for your relatives, the people of Israel, to mourn for those he destroyed by fire."
Leviticus,10,7,"But you are the LORD 's chosen priests, and you must not leave the sacred tent, or you will die. Aaron and his two sons obeyed Moses."
Leviticus,10,8,The LORD said to Aaron:
Leviticus,10,9,"When you or your sons enter the sacred tent, you must never drink beer or wine. If you do, you will die there! This law will never change."
Leviticus,10,10,You must learn the difference between what is holy and what isn't holy and between the clean and the unclean.
Leviticus,10,11,You must also teach the people of Israel everything that I commanded Moses to say to them.
Leviticus,10,12,"Moses told Aaron and his two sons, Eleazar and Ithamar: The grain sacrifice that was offered to give thanks to the LORD is very holy. So make bread without yeast from the part that wasn't sent up in smoke and eat it beside the altar."
Leviticus,10,13,"The LORD has said that this belongs to you and your sons, and that it must be eaten in a holy place."
Leviticus,11,1,The LORD told Moses and Aaron
Leviticus,11,2,to say to the community of Israel: You may eat
Leviticus,11,3,any animal that has divided hoofs and chews the cud.
Leviticus,12,1,The LORD told Moses
Leviticus,12,2,"to say to the community of Israel: If a woman gives birth to a son, she is unclean for seven days, just as she is during her monthly period."
Leviticus,12,3,"Her son must be circumcised on the eighth day,"
Leviticus,12,4,but her loss of blood keeps her from being completely clean for another thirty-three days. During this time she must not touch anything holy or go to the place of worship.
Leviticus,12,5,"Any woman who gives birth to a daughter is unclean for two weeks, just as she is during her period. And she won't be completely clean for another sixty-six days."
Leviticus,12,6,"When the mother has completed her time of cleansing, she must come to the front of the sacred tent and bring to the priest a year-old lamb as a sacrifice to please me and a dove or a pigeon as a sacrifice for sin."
Leviticus,12,7,"After the priest offers the sacrifices to me, the mother will become completely clean from her loss of blood, whether her child is a boy or a girl."
Leviticus,12,8,"If she cannot afford a lamb, she can offer two doves or two pigeons, one as a sacrifice to please me and the other as a sacrifice for sin."
Leviticus,13,1,The LORD told Moses and Aaron to say to the people:
Leviticus,13,2,"If sores or boils or a skin rash should break out and start spreading on your body, you must be brought to Aaron or to one of the other priests."
Leviticus,13,3,"If the priest discovers that the hair in the infected area has turned white and that the infection seems more than skin deep, he will say, “This is leprosy —you are unclean.”"
Leviticus,13,4,"But if the infected area is white and only skin deep, and if the hair in it hasn't turned white, the priest will order you to stay away from everyone else for seven days."
Leviticus,13,5,"If the disease hasn't spread by that time, he will order you to stay away from everyone else for another seven days."
Leviticus,13,6,"Then if the disease hasn't got any worse or spread, the priest will say, “You are clean. It was only a sore. After you wash your clothes, you may go home.”"
Leviticus,13,7,"However, if the disease comes back, you must return to the priest."
Leviticus,13,8,"If it is discovered that the disease has started spreading, he will say, “This is leprosy—you are unclean.”"
Leviticus,13,9,Any of you with a skin disease must be brought to a priest.
Leviticus,13,10,"If he discovers that the sore spot is white with pus and that the hair around it has also turned white,"
Leviticus,13,11,"he will say, “This is leprosy. You are unclean and must stay away from everyone else.”"
Leviticus,14,1,The LORD told Moses to say to the people:
Leviticus,15,1,The LORD told Moses and Aaron
Leviticus,15,2,"to say to the community of Israel: Any man with an infected penis is unclean,"
Leviticus,15,3,whether it is stopped up or keeps dripping.
Leviticus,15,4,"Anything that he rests on or sits on is also unclean,"
Leviticus,17,1,The LORD told Moses
Leviticus,17,2,"to tell Aaron, his sons, and everyone else in Israel:"
Leviticus,18,1,The LORD told Moses
Leviticus,18,2,to tell the people of Israel: I am the LORD your God!
Leviticus,18,3,So don't follow the customs of Egypt where you used to live or those of Canaan where I am bringing you.
Leviticus,18,4,"I am the LORD your God, and you must obey my teachings."
Leviticus,18,5,Obey them and you will live. I am the LORD.
Leviticus,18,6,"Don't have sex with any of your close relatives,"
Leviticus,18,7,especially your own mother. This would disgrace your father.
Leviticus,18,8,And don't disgrace him by having sex with any of his other wives.
Leviticus,18,9,"Don't have sex with your sister or stepsister, whether you grew up together or not."
Leviticus,18,10,Don't disgrace yourself by having sex with your granddaughter
Leviticus,18,11,or half-sister
Leviticus,19,1,The LORD told Moses
Leviticus,19,2,"to say to the community of Israel: I am the LORD your God. I am holy, and you must be holy too!"
Leviticus,20,1,The LORD told Moses
Leviticus,20,2,to say to the community of Israel: Death by stoning is the penalty for any citizens or foreigners in the country who sacrifice their children to the god Molech.
Leviticus,20,3,"They have disgraced both the place where I am worshipped and my holy name, and so I will turn against them and no longer let them belong to my people."
Leviticus,20,4,"Some of you may let them get away with human sacrifice,"
Leviticus,20,5,"but not me. If any of you worship Molech, I will turn against you and your entire family, and I will no longer let you belong to my people."
Leviticus,20,6,"I will be your enemy if you go to someone who claims to speak with the dead, and I will destroy you from among my people."
Leviticus,20,7,Dedicate yourselves to me and be holy because I am the LORD your God.
Leviticus,20,8,"I have chosen you as my people, and I expect you to obey my laws."
Leviticus,20,9,"If you curse your father or mother, you will be put to death, and it will be your own fault."
Leviticus,20,10,"If any of you men have sex with another man's wife, both you and the woman will be put to death."
Leviticus,20,11,"Having sex with one of your father's wives disgraces him. So both you and the woman will be put to death, just as you deserve."
Leviticus,20,12,"It isn't natural to have sex with your daughter-in-law, and both of you will be put to death, just as you deserve."
Leviticus,20,13,"It's disgusting for men to have sex with one another, and those who do will be put to death, just as they deserve."
Leviticus,20,14,"It isn't natural for a man to marry both a mother and her daughter, and so all three of them will be burnt to death."
Leviticus,21,1,"The LORD gave Moses these instructions for Aaron's sons, the priests: Touching a dead body will make you unclean. So don't go near a dead relative,"
Leviticus,21,2,"except your mother, father, son, daughter, brother,"
Leviticus,21,3,"or an unmarried sister, who has no husband to take care of her."
Leviticus,21,4,Don't make yourself unclean by attending the funeral of someone related to you by marriage.
Leviticus,21,5,Don't shave any part of your head or trim your beard or cut yourself to show that you are mourning.
Leviticus,21,6,"I am the LORD your God, and I have chosen you alone to offer sacrifices of food to me on the altar. That's why you must keep yourselves holy."
Leviticus,21,7,"Don't marry a divorced woman or a woman who has served as a temple prostitute. You are holy,"
Leviticus,21,8,"because I am holy. And so, you must be treated with proper respect, since you offer food sacrifices to me, the God of holiness."
Leviticus,21,9,"If any of you priests has a daughter who disgraces you by serving as a temple prostitute, she must be burnt to death."
Leviticus,21,10,"If you are the high priest, you must not leave your hair uncombed or tear your clothes in order to mourn for the dead."
Leviticus,21,11,"Don't make yourself unclean by going near a dead body, not even that of your own father or mother."
Leviticus,21,12,"If you leave the sacred place to attend a funeral, both you and the sacred place become unclean, because you are the high priest."
Leviticus,21,13,"If you are the high priest, you must marry only a virgin"
Leviticus,21,14,"from your own tribe. Don't marry a divorced woman or any other woman who has already had sex, including a temple prostitute."
Leviticus,21,15,"In this way, your descendants will be qualified to serve me. Remember—I am the LORD , and I have chosen you."
Leviticus,21,16,The LORD told Moses
Leviticus,22,1,The LORD told Moses
Leviticus,22,2,"to say to Aaron and his sons: I am the LORD God, and I demand that you honour my holy name by showing proper respect for the offerings brought to me by the people of Israel."
Leviticus,22,3,"If any of you are unclean when you accept an offering for me, I will no longer let you serve as a priest."
Leviticus,22,4,"None of you may take part in the sacred meals while you have a skin disease or an infected penis, or after you have been near a dead body or have had a flow of semen,"
Leviticus,22,5,"or if you have touched an unclean creature of any sort, including an unclean person."
Leviticus,23,1,The LORD told Moses
Leviticus,23,2,to say to the community of Israel: I have chosen certain times for you to come together and worship me.
Leviticus,23,3,"You have six days when you can do your work, but the seventh day of each week is holy because it belongs to me. No matter where you live, you must rest on the Sabbath and come together for worship. This law will never change."
Leviticus,24,1,The LORD told Moses
Leviticus,24,2,"to say to the community of Israel: You must supply the purest olive oil for the lamps in the sacred tent, so they will keep burning."
Leviticus,25,1,"When Moses was on Mount Sinai, the LORD told him"
Leviticus,25,2,"to say to the community of Israel: After you enter the land that I am giving you, it must be allowed to rest one year out of every seven."
Leviticus,25,3,"You may raise grain and grapes for six years,"
Leviticus,25,4,"but the seventh year you must let your fields and vineyards rest in honour of me, your LORD."
Leviticus,25,5,"This is to be a time of complete rest for your fields and vineyards, so don't harvest anything they produce."
Leviticus,26,1,I am the LORD your God! So don't make or worship any sort of idols or images.
Leviticus,26,2,"Respect the Sabbath and honour the place where I am worshipped, because I am the LORD."
Leviticus,26,3,"Faithfully obey my laws,"
Leviticus,26,4,and I will send rain to make your crops grow and your trees produce fruit.
Leviticus,26,5,"Your harvest of grain and grapes will be so abundant, that you won't know what to do with it all. You will eat and be satisfied, and you will live in safety."
Leviticus,26,6,"I will bless your country with peace, and you will rest without fear. I will wipe out the dangerous animals and protect you from enemy attacks."
Leviticus,26,7,"You will chase and destroy your enemies,"
Leviticus,26,8,"even if there are only five of you and a hundred of them, or only a hundred of you and ten thousand of them."
Leviticus,26,9,"I will treat you with such kindness that your nation will grow strong, and I will also keep my promises to you."
Leviticus,26,10,Your barns will overflow with grain each year.
Leviticus,26,11,I will live among you and never again look on you with disgust.
Leviticus,26,12,"I will walk with you—I will be your God, and you will be my people."
Leviticus,26,13,"I am the LORD your God, and I rescued you from Egypt, so that you would never again be slaves. I have set you free; now walk with your heads held high."
Leviticus,27,1,The LORD told Moses
Leviticus,27,2,"to say to the community of Israel: If you ever want to free someone who has been promised to me,"
