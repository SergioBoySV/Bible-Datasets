Jeremiah,1,1,"My name is Jeremiah. I am a priest, and my father Hilkiah and everyone else in my family are from Anathoth in the territory of the Benjamin tribe. This book contains the things that the LORD told me to say."
Jeremiah,1,2,"The LORD first spoke to me in the thirteenth year that Josiah was king of Judah,"
Jeremiah,1,3,and he continued to speak to me during the rule of Josiah's son Jehoiakim. The last time the LORD spoke to me was in the fifth month of the eleventh year that Josiah's son Zedekiah was king. That was also when the people of Jerusalem were taken away as prisoners.
Jeremiah,1,4,The LORD said:
Jeremiah,1,5,"“Jeremiah, I am your Creator, and before you were born, I chose you to speak for me to the nations.”"
Jeremiah,1,6,"I replied, “I'm not a good speaker, LORD , and I'm too young.”"
Jeremiah,1,7,"“Don't say you're too young,” the LORD answered. “If I tell you to go and speak to someone, then go! And when I tell you what to say, don't leave out a word!"
Jeremiah,1,8,"I promise to be with you and keep you safe, so don't be afraid.”"
Jeremiah,1,9,"The LORD reached out his hand, then he touched my mouth and said, “I am giving you the words to say,"
Jeremiah,1,10,"and I am sending you with authority to speak to the nations for me. You will tell them of doom and destruction, and of rising and rebuilding again.”"
Jeremiah,1,11,"The LORD showed me something in a vision. Then he asked, “What do you see, Jeremiah?” I answered, “A branch of almonds that ripen early.”"
Jeremiah,1,12,"“That's right,” the LORD replied, “and I always rise early to keep a promise.”"
Jeremiah,1,13,"Then the LORD showed me something else and asked, “What do you see now?” I answered, “I see a pot of boiling water in the north, and it's about to spill out towards us.”"
Jeremiah,1,14,The LORD said: I will pour out destruction all over the land.
Jeremiah,1,15,"Just watch while I send for the kings of the north. They will attack and capture Jerusalem and other towns, then set up their thrones at the gates of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,1,16,"I will punish my people, because they are guilty of turning from me to worship idols."
Jeremiah,1,17,"Jeremiah, get ready! Go and tell the people what I command you to say. Don't be frightened by them, or I will make you terrified while they watch."
Jeremiah,1,18,"My power will make you strong like a fortress or a column of iron or a wall of bronze. You will oppose all of Judah, including its kings and leaders, its priests and people."
Jeremiah,1,19,"They will fight back, but they won't win. I, the LORD , give my word— I won't let them harm you."
Jeremiah,2,1,The LORD told me
Jeremiah,2,2,"to go to Jerusalem and tell everyone that he had said: When you were my young bride, you loved me and followed me through the barren desert."
Jeremiah,2,3,"You belonged to me alone, like the first part of the harvest, and I severely punished those who ill-treated you."
Jeremiah,2,4,"Listen, people of Israel,"
Jeremiah,2,5,"and I, the LORD , will speak. I was never unfair to your ancestors, but they left me and became worthless by following worthless idols."
Jeremiah,2,6,"Your ancestors refused to ask for my help, though I had rescued them from Egypt and led them through a treacherous, barren desert, where no one lives or dares to travel."
Jeremiah,2,7,"I brought you here to my land, where food is abundant, but you made my land filthy with your sins."
Jeremiah,2,8,The priests who teach my laws don't care to know me. Your leaders rebel against me; your prophets give messages from Baal and worship false gods.
Jeremiah,2,9,I will take you to court and accuse you and your descendants
Jeremiah,3,1,"The LORD said to the people of Israel: If a divorced woman marries, can her first husband ever marry her again? No, because this would pollute the land. But you have more gods than a prostitute has lovers. Why should I take you back?"
Jeremiah,3,2,"Just try to find one hilltop where you haven't gone to worship other gods by having sex. You sat beside the road like a robber in ambush, except you offered yourself to every passer-by. Your sins of unfaithfulness have polluted the land."
Jeremiah,3,3,"So I, the LORD , refused to let the spring rains fall. But just like a prostitute, you still have no shame for what you have done."
Jeremiah,3,4,You call me your father or your long-lost friend;
Jeremiah,3,5,"you beg me to stop being angry, but you won't stop sinning."
Jeremiah,3,6,"When Josiah was king, the LORD said: Jeremiah, the kingdom of Israel was like an unfaithful wife who became a prostitute on the hilltops and in the shade of large trees."
Jeremiah,4,1,"The LORD said: Israel, if you really want to come back to me, get rid of those disgusting idols."
Jeremiah,4,2,"Make promises only in my name, and do what you promise! Then all nations will praise me, and I will bless them."
Jeremiah,4,3,"People of Jerusalem and Judah, don't be so stubborn! Your hearts have become hard, like unploughed ground where thorn bushes grow."
Jeremiah,4,4,"With all your hearts, keep the agreement I made with you. But if you are stubborn and keep on sinning, my anger will burn like a fire that cannot be put out."
Jeremiah,5,1,"“Search Jerusalem for honest people who try to be faithful. If you can find even one, I'll forgive the whole city."
Jeremiah,5,2,Everyone breaks promises made in my name.”
Jeremiah,5,3,"I answered, “I know that you look for truth. You punished your people for their lies, but in spite of the pain, they became more stubborn and refused to turn back to you.”"
Jeremiah,5,4,"Then I thought to myself, “These common people act like fools, and they have never learnt what the LORD their God demands of them."
Jeremiah,5,5,I'll go and talk to the leaders. They know what God demands.” But even they had decided not to obey the LORD.
Jeremiah,5,6,"The people have rebelled and rejected the LORD too many times. So enemies will attack like lions from the forest or wolves from the desert. Those enemies will watch the towns of Judah, and like leopards they will tear to pieces whoever goes outside."
Jeremiah,5,7,"People of Judah, how can I forgive you? I gave you everything, but you abandoned me and worshipped idols. You men go to prostitutes and are unfaithful to your wives."
Jeremiah,5,8,"You are no better than animals, and you always want sex with someone else's wife."
Jeremiah,5,9,Why shouldn't I punish the people of Judah?
Jeremiah,5,10,"I will tell their enemies, “Go through my vineyard. Don't destroy the vines, but cut off the branches, because they are the people who don't belong to me.”"
Jeremiah,5,11,"In every way, Judah and Israel have been unfaithful to me."
Jeremiah,6,1,"Run for your lives, people of Benjamin. Get out of Jerusalem. Sound a trumpet in Tekoa and light a signal fire in Beth-Haccherem. Soon you will be struck by disaster from the north."
Jeremiah,8,1,"Then the bones of the dead kings of Judah and their officials will be dug up, along with the bones of the priests, the prophets, and everyone else in Jerusalem"
Jeremiah,8,2,"who loved and worshipped the sun, moon, and stars. These bones will be scattered and left lying on the ground like rubbish, where the sun and moon and stars can shine on them."
Jeremiah,8,3,"Some of you people of Judah will be left alive, but I will force you to go to foreign countries, and you will wish you were dead. I, the LORD God All-Powerful, have spoken."
Jeremiah,8,4,"The LORD said: People of Jerusalem, when you stumble and fall, you get back up, and if you take a wrong road, you turn round and go back."
Jeremiah,8,5,So why do you refuse to come back to me? Why do you hold so tightly to your false gods?
Jeremiah,8,6,"I listen carefully, but none of you admit that you've done wrong. Without a second thought, you run down the wrong road like cavalry troops charging into battle."
Jeremiah,8,7,"Storks, doves, swallows, and thrushes all know when it's time to fly away for the winter and when to come back. But you, my people, don't know what I demand."
Jeremiah,8,8,"You say, “We are wise because we have the teachings and laws of the LORD .” But I say that your teachers have turned my words into lies!"
Jeremiah,8,9,"Your wise men have rejected what I say, and so they have no wisdom. Now they will be trapped and put to shame; they won't know what to do."
Jeremiah,8,10,"I'll give their wives and fields to strangers. Everyone is greedy and dishonest, whether poor or rich. Even the prophets and priests cannot be trusted."
Jeremiah,8,11,All they ever offer to my deeply wounded people are empty hopes for peace.
Jeremiah,8,12,"They should be ashamed of their disgusting sins, but they don't even blush. And so, when I punish Judah, they will end up on the ground, dead like everyone else."
Jeremiah,8,13,"I will wipe them out. They are vines without grapes; fig trees without figs or leaves. They have not done a thing that I told them! I, the LORD , have spoken."
Jeremiah,8,14,"The people of Judah say to each other, “What are we waiting for? Let's run to a town with walls and die there. We rebelled against the LORD, and we were sentenced to die by drinking poison."
Jeremiah,8,15,"We had hoped for peace and a time of healing, but all we got was terror."
Jeremiah,8,16,"Our enemies have reached the town of Dan in the north, and the snorting of their horses makes us tremble with fear. The enemy will destroy Jerusalem and our entire nation. No one will survive.”"
Jeremiah,8,17,"“Watch out!” the LORD says. “I'm sending poisonous snakes to attack you, and no one can stop them.”"
Jeremiah,8,18,I'm burdened with sorrow and feel like giving up.
Jeremiah,8,19,"In a foreign land my people are crying. Listen! You'll hear them say, “Has the LORD deserted Zion? Is he no longer its king?” I hear the LORD reply, “Why did you make me angry by worshipping useless idols?”"
Jeremiah,8,20,"The people complain, “Spring and summer have come and gone, but still the LORD hasn't rescued us.”"
Jeremiah,8,21,"My people are crushed, and so is my heart. I am horrified and mourn."
Jeremiah,8,22,"If medicine and doctors may be found in Gilead, why aren't my people healed?"
Jeremiah,9,1,"I wish that my eyes were fountains of tears, so I could cry day and night for my people who were killed."
Jeremiah,9,2,I wish I could go into the desert and find a hiding place from all who are treacherous and unfaithful to God.
Jeremiah,9,3,"The LORD replied: Lies come from the mouths of my people, like arrows from a bow. With each dishonest deed their power increases, and not one of them will admit that I am God."
Jeremiah,9,4,"Jeremiah, all your friends and relatives tell lies about you, so don't trust them."
Jeremiah,9,5,"They wear themselves out, always looking for a new way to cheat their friends."
Jeremiah,9,6,"Everyone takes advantage of everyone else, and no one will admit that I am God."
Jeremiah,9,7,And so I will purify the hearts of my people just as gold is purified in a furnace. I have no other choice.
Jeremiah,9,8,"They say they want peace, but this lie is deadly, like an arrow that strikes when you least expect it."
Jeremiah,9,9,"Give me one good reason not to punish them as they deserve. I, the LORD All-Powerful, have spoken."
Jeremiah,9,10,"I weep for the pasture land in the hill country. It's so barren and scorched that no one travels there. No cattle can be found there, and birds and wild animals have all disappeared."
Jeremiah,9,11,"I heard the LORD reply, “When I have finished, Jerusalem and the towns of Judah will be piles of ruins where only jackals live.”"
Jeremiah,9,12,"I said to the LORD , “None of us can understand why the land has become like an uncrossable desert. Won't you explain why?”"
Jeremiah,9,13,The LORD said: I destroyed the land because the people disobeyed me and rejected my laws and teachings.
Jeremiah,9,14,"They were stubborn and worshipped Baal, just as their ancestors did."
Jeremiah,9,15,"So I, the LORD All-Powerful, the God of Israel, promise them poison to eat and drink."
Jeremiah,9,16,"I'll scatter them in foreign countries that they and their ancestors have never even heard of. Finally, I will send enemy soldiers to kill every last one of them."
Jeremiah,9,17,"The LORD All-Powerful said, “Send for the women who are paid to weep at funerals, especially the women who can cry the loudest.”"
Jeremiah,9,18,"The people answered, “Let them come quickly and cry for us, until our own eyes are flooded with tears."
Jeremiah,9,19,"Now those of us on Zion cry, ‘We are ruined! We can't stand the shame. Our homes have been destroyed, and we must leave our land.’"
Jeremiah,9,20,“We ask you women to pay attention to what the LORD says. We will teach you a funeral song that you can teach your daughters and friends:
Jeremiah,9,21,"‘We were in our fortress, but death sneaked in through our windows. It even struck down children at play and our strongest young men.’"
Jeremiah,9,22,"“The LORD has told us the ground will be covered with dead bodies, like stalks of ungathered grain or like manure.”"
Jeremiah,9,23,The LORD says: Don't boast about your wisdom or strength or wealth.
Jeremiah,9,24,"If you feel you must boast, then have enough sense to boast about worshipping me, the LORD. What I like best is showing kindness, justice, and mercy to everyone on earth."
Jeremiah,12,1,"Whenever I complain to you, LORD, you are always fair. But now I have questions about your justice. Why is life easy for sinners? Why are they successful?"
Jeremiah,12,2,"You plant them like trees; you let them prosper and produce fruit. Yet even when they praise you, they don't mean it."
Jeremiah,12,3,"But you know, LORD, how faithful I've always been, even in my thoughts. So drag my enemies away and butcher them like sheep!"
Jeremiah,12,4,"How long will the ground be dry and the pasture lands parched? The birds and animals are dead and gone. And all this happened because the people are so sinful. They even boast, “God can't see the sins we commit.”"
Jeremiah,12,5,"Jeremiah, if you get tired in a race against people, how can you possibly run against horses? If you fall in open fields, what will happen in the forest along the River Jordan?"
Jeremiah,12,6,"Even your own family has turned against you. They act friendly, but don't trust them. They're out to get you, and so is everyone else."
Jeremiah,12,7,I loved my people and chose them as my very own. But now I will reject them and hand them over to their enemies.
Jeremiah,12,8,My people have turned against me and roar at me like lions. That's why I hate them.
Jeremiah,12,9,My people are like a hawk surrounded and attacked by other hawks. Tell the wild animals to come and eat their fill.
Jeremiah,12,10,My beautiful land is ruined like a field or a vineyard trampled by shepherds and stripped bare by their flocks.
Jeremiah,12,11,"Every field I see lies barren, and no one cares."
Jeremiah,12,12,A destroying army marches along desert roads and attacks everywhere. They are my deadly sword; no one is safe from them.
Jeremiah,12,13,"My people, you planted wheat, but because I was furious, I let only weeds grow. You wore yourselves out for nothing!"
Jeremiah,12,14,"The LORD said: I gave this land to my people Israel, but enemies around it have attacked and robbed it. So I will uproot them from their own countries just as I will uproot Judah from its land."
Jeremiah,12,15,"But later, I will have pity on these nations and bring them back to their own lands."
Jeremiah,12,16,"They once taught my people to worship Baal. But if they admit I am the only true God, and if they let my people teach them how to worship me, these nations will also become my people."
Jeremiah,12,17,"However, if they don't listen to me, I will uproot them from their lands and completely destroy them. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Jeremiah,13,1,"The LORD told me, “Go and buy a pair of linen shorts. Wear them for a while, but don't wash them.”"
Jeremiah,13,2,So I bought a pair of shorts and put them on.
Jeremiah,13,3,"Then the LORD said,"
Jeremiah,13,4,“Take off the shorts. Go to Parah and hide the shorts in a crack between some large rocks.”
Jeremiah,13,5,And that's what I did.
Jeremiah,13,6,"Some time later the LORD said, “Go back and get the shorts.”"
Jeremiah,13,7,"I went back and dug the shorts out of their hiding place, but the cloth had rotted, and the shorts were ruined."
Jeremiah,13,8,Then the LORD said:
Jeremiah,13,9,"Jeremiah, I will use Babylonia to destroy the pride of the people of Judah and Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,13,10,"The people of Judah are evil and stubborn. So instead of listening to me, they do whatever they want and even worship other gods. When I have finished with these people, they will be good for nothing, just like this pair of shorts."
Jeremiah,13,11,"These shorts were tight around your waist, and that's how tightly I held on to the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. I wanted them to be my people. I wanted to make them famous, so that other nations would praise and honour me, but they refused to obey me."
Jeremiah,13,12,"Jeremiah, tell the people of Judah, “The LORD God of Israel orders you to fill your wine jars with wine.” They will answer, “Of course we fill our wine jars with wine! Why are you telling us something we already know?”"
Jeremiah,13,13,"Then say to them: I am the LORD , and what I'm going to do will make everyone in Judah and Jerusalem appear to be full of wine. And the worst ones will be the kings of David's family and the priests and the prophets."
Jeremiah,13,14,"Then I will smash them against each other like jars. I will have no pity on the young or the old, and they will all be destroyed. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Jeremiah,13,15,"People of Judah, don't be too proud to listen to what the LORD has said."
Jeremiah,13,16,"You hope for light, but God is sending darkness. Evening shadows already deepen in the hills. So return to God and confess your sins to him before you trip and fall."
Jeremiah,13,17,"If you are too proud to listen, I will weep alone. Tears will stream from my eyes when the LORD 's people are taken away as prisoners."
Jeremiah,13,18,The LORD told me to tell you that your king and his mother must surrender their thrones and remove their crowns.
Jeremiah,13,19,The cities in the Southern Desert are surrounded; no one can get in or out. Everyone in Judah will be taken away.
Jeremiah,13,20,"Jerusalem, you were so proud of ruling the people of Judah. But where are they now? Look north, and you will see your enemies approaching."
Jeremiah,13,21,"You once trusted them to help, but now I'll let them rule you. What do you say about that? You will be in pain like a woman giving birth."
Jeremiah,13,22,Do you know why your clothes were torn off and you were abused? It was because of your terrible sins.
Jeremiah,13,23,"Can you ever change and do what's right? Can people change the colour of their skin, or can a leopard remove its spots? If so, then perhaps you can change and learn to do right."
Jeremiah,13,24,"I will scatter you, just as the desert wind blows husks from grain tossed in the air."
Jeremiah,13,25,"I won't change my mind. I, the LORD , have spoken. You rejected me and worshipped false gods."
Jeremiah,14,1,"When there had been no rain for a long time, the LORD told me to say to the people:"
Jeremiah,14,2,Judah and Jerusalem weep as the land dries up.
Jeremiah,14,3,Rulers send their servants to the storage pits for water. But there's none to be found; they return in despair with their jars still empty.
Jeremiah,14,4,"There has been no rain, and farmers feel sick as they watch cracks appear in the dry ground."
Jeremiah,14,5,"A deer gives birth in a field, then abandons her newborn fawn and leaves in search of grass."
Jeremiah,14,6,"Wild donkeys go blind from starvation. So they stand on barren hilltops and sniff the air, hoping to smell green grass."
Jeremiah,14,7,"Our terrible sins may demand that we be punished. But if you rescue us, LORD, everyone will see how great you are."
Jeremiah,14,8,"You're our only hope; you alone can save us now. You help us one day, but you're gone the next."
Jeremiah,14,9,"Did this disaster take you by surprise? Are you a warrior with your hands tied? You have chosen us, and your temple is here. Don't abandon us!"
Jeremiah,14,10,"My people, you love to wander away; you don't even try to stay close to me. So now I will reject you and punish you for your sins. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Jeremiah,14,11,"The LORD said, “Jeremiah, don't ask me to help these people."
Jeremiah,14,12,"They may even go without eating and offer sacrifices to please me and to give thanks. But when they cry out for my help, I won't listen, and I won't accept their sacrifices. Instead, I'll send war, starvation, and disease to wipe them out.”"
Jeremiah,14,13,"I replied, “The other prophets keep telling everyone that you won't send starvation or war, and that you're going to give us peace.”"
Jeremiah,14,14,"The LORD answered: They claim to speak for me, but they're lying! I didn't even speak to them, much less choose them to be my prophets. Their messages come from worthless dreams, useless fortune-telling, and their own imaginations."
Jeremiah,14,15,Those lying prophets say there will be peace and plenty of food. But I say that those same prophets will die from war and hunger.
Jeremiah,14,16,"And everyone who listens to them will be killed, just as they deserve. Their dead bodies will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem, because their families will also be dead, and no one will be left to bury them."
Jeremiah,14,17,"Jeremiah, go and tell the people how you feel about all this. So I told them: “Tears will flood my eyes both day and night, because my nation suffers from a deadly wound."
Jeremiah,14,18,"In the fields I see the bodies of those killed in battle. And in the towns I see crowds dying of hunger. But the prophets and priests go about their business, without understanding what has happened.”"
Jeremiah,14,19,"Have you rejected Judah, LORD? Do you hate Jerusalem? Why did you strike down Judah with a fatal wound? We had hoped for peace and a time of healing, but all we got was terror."
Jeremiah,14,20,We and our ancestors are guilty of rebelling against you.
Jeremiah,14,21,"If you save us, it will show how great you are. Don't let our enemies disgrace your temple, your beautiful throne. Don't forget that you promised to rescue us."
Jeremiah,14,22,"Idols can't send rain, and showers don't fall by themselves. Only you control the rain, so we put our trust in you, the LORD our God."
Jeremiah,15,1,"The LORD said to me: Even if Moses and Samuel were here, praying with you, I wouldn't change my mind. So send the people of Judah away."
Jeremiah,15,2,"And when they ask where they are going, tell them that I, the LORD , have said: Some of you are going to die of horrible diseases. Others are going to die in war or from starvation. The rest will be led away to a foreign country."
Jeremiah,15,3,"I will punish you in four different ways: You will be killed in war and your bodies dragged off by dogs, your flesh will be eaten by birds, and your bones will be chewed on by wild animals."
Jeremiah,15,4,This punishment will happen because of the horrible things your King Manasseh did. And you will be disgusting to all nations on earth.
Jeremiah,15,5,"People of Jerusalem, who will feel sorry for you? Will anyone bother to ask if you are well?"
Jeremiah,15,6,"My people, you abandoned me and walked away. I am tired of showing mercy; that's why I'll destroy you"
Jeremiah,15,7,"by scattering you like straw blown by the wind. I will punish you with sorrow and death, because you refuse to change your ways."
Jeremiah,15,8,There will be more widows in Judah than grains of sand on a beach. A surprise attack at midday! And the mothers in Jerusalem mourn for their children.
Jeremiah,15,9,"A mother is in deep despair and struggles for breath. Her daylight has turned to darkness— she has suffered the loss of her seven sons. I will kill anyone who survives. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Jeremiah,15,10,"I wish I had never been born! I'm always in trouble with everyone in Judah. I never lend or borrow money, but everyone curses me just the same."
Jeremiah,15,11,"Then the LORD replied, “I promise to protect you, and when disaster comes, even your enemies will beg you for help.”"
Jeremiah,15,12,"People of Judah, just as you can't break iron mixed with bronze, you can't defeat the enemies who will attack from the north."
Jeremiah,15,13,"I will give them everything you own, because you have sinned everywhere in your country."
Jeremiah,15,14,"My anger is a fire that cannot be put out, so I will make you slaves of your enemies in a foreign land."
Jeremiah,15,15,"You can see how I suffer insult after insult, all because of you, LORD. Don't be so patient with my enemies; take revenge on them before they kill me."
Jeremiah,15,16,"When you spoke to me, I was glad to obey, because I belong to you, the LORD All-Powerful."
Jeremiah,15,17,"I don't go to parties and have a good time. Instead, I keep to myself, because you have filled me with your anger."
Jeremiah,15,18,"I am badly injured and in constant pain. Are you going to disappoint me, like a stream that goes dry in the heat of summer?"
Jeremiah,15,19,"Then the LORD told me: Stop talking like a fool! If you turn back to me and speak my message, I will let you be my prophet once again. I hope the people of Judah will accept what you say. But you can ignore their threats,"
Jeremiah,16,1,The LORD said to me:
Jeremiah,16,2,"Jeremiah, don't get married and have children—Judah is no place to raise a family."
Jeremiah,16,3,I'll tell you what's going to happen to children and their parents here.
Jeremiah,16,4,"They will die of horrible diseases and of war and starvation. No one will give them a funeral or bury them, and their bodies will be food for the birds and wild animals. And what's left will lie on the ground like manure."
Jeremiah,16,5,"When someone dies, don't visit the family or show any sorrow. I will no longer love or bless or have any pity on the people of Judah."
Jeremiah,16,6,Rich and poor alike will die and be left unburied. No one will mourn and show their sorrow by cutting themselves or shaving their heads.
Jeremiah,16,7,No one will bring food and wine to help comfort those who are mourning the death of their father or mother.
Jeremiah,16,8,Don't even set foot in a house where there is eating and drinking and celebrating.
Jeremiah,16,9,"Warn the people of Judah that I, the LORD All-Powerful, will put an end to all their parties and wedding celebrations."
Jeremiah,16,10,"They will ask, “Why has the LORD our God threatened us with so many disasters? Have we done something wrong or sinned against him?”"
Jeremiah,16,11,"Then tell them I have said: People of Judah, your ancestors turned away from me; they rejected my laws and teachings and started worshipping other gods."
Jeremiah,16,12,"And you have done even worse! You are stubborn, and instead of obeying me, you do whatever evil comes to your mind."
Jeremiah,16,13,"So I will throw you into a land that you and your ancestors know nothing about, a place where you will have to worship other gods both day and night. And I won't feel the least bit sorry for you."
Jeremiah,16,14,A time will come when you will again worship me. But you will no longer call me the Living God who rescued Israel from Egypt.
Jeremiah,16,15,"Instead, you will call me the Living God who rescued you from that country in the north and from the other countries where I had forced you to go. Some day I will bring you back to this land that I gave your ancestors."
Jeremiah,16,16,"But for now, I am sending enemies who will catch you like fish and hunt you down like wild animals in the hills and the caves."
Jeremiah,16,17,"I can see everything you are doing, even if you try to hide your sins from me."
Jeremiah,16,18,"I will punish you double for your sins, because you have made my own land disgusting. You have filled it with lifeless idols that remind me of dead bodies."
Jeremiah,16,19,"Our LORD , you are the one who gives me strength and protects me like a fortress when I am in trouble. People will come to you from distant nations and say, “Our ancestors worshipped false and useless gods,"
Jeremiah,16,20,worthless idols made by human hands.”
Jeremiah,16,21,"Then the LORD replied, “That's why I will teach them about my power, and they will know that I am the true God.”"
Jeremiah,17,1,"People of Judah, your sins cannot be erased. They are written on your hearts like words chiselled in stone or carved on the corners of your altars."
Jeremiah,18,1,"The LORD told me,"
Jeremiah,18,2,"“Go to the pottery shop, and when you get there, I will tell you what to say to the people.”"
Jeremiah,18,3,I went there and saw the potter making clay pots on his pottery wheel.
Jeremiah,18,4,"And whenever the clay would not take the shape he wanted, he would change his mind and form it into some other shape."
Jeremiah,18,5,Then the LORD told me to say:
Jeremiah,18,6,"People of Israel, I, the LORD , have power over you, just as a potter has power over clay."
Jeremiah,18,7,If I threaten to uproot and shatter an evil nation
Jeremiah,18,8,"and that nation turns from its evil, I will change my mind."
Jeremiah,18,9,"If I promise to make a nation strong,"
Jeremiah,18,10,"but its people start disobeying me and doing evil, then I will change my mind and not help them at all."
Jeremiah,18,11,"So listen to me, people of Judah and Jerusalem! I have decided to strike you with disaster, and I won't change my mind unless you stop sinning and start living right."
Jeremiah,18,12,"But I know you won't listen. You might as well answer, “We don't care what you say. We have made plans to sin, and we are going to be stubborn and do what we want!”"
Jeremiah,18,13,"So I, the LORD , command you to ask the nations, and find out if they have ever heard of such a horrible sin as what you have done."
Jeremiah,18,14,"The snow on Lebanon's mountains never melts away, and the streams there never run dry."
Jeremiah,18,15,"But you, my people, have turned from me to burn incense to worthless idols. You have left the ancient road to follow an unknown path where you stumble over idols."
Jeremiah,18,16,"Your land will be ruined, and every passer-by will look at it with horror and make insulting remarks."
Jeremiah,18,17,"When your enemies attack, I will scatter you like dust blown by an eastern wind. Then, on that day of disaster, I will turn my back on you."
Jeremiah,18,18,"Some of the people said, “Let's get rid of Jeremiah! We will always have priests to teach us God's laws, as well as wise people to give us advice, and prophets to speak the LORD 's messages. So, instead of listening to Jeremiah any longer, let's accuse him of a crime.”"
Jeremiah,18,19,"Please, LORD , answer my prayer. Make my enemies stop accusing me of evil."
Jeremiah,18,20,"I tried to help them, but they are paying me back by digging a pit to trap me. I even begged you not to punish them."
Jeremiah,18,21,But now I am asking you to let their children starve or be killed in war. Let women lose their husbands and sons to disease and violence.
Jeremiah,18,22,"These people have dug pits and set traps for me, LORD. Make them scream in fear when you send enemy troops to attack their homes."
Jeremiah,18,23,You know they plan to kill me. So get angry and punish them! Don't ever forgive their terrible crimes.
Jeremiah,19,1,"The LORD said: Jeremiah, go to the pottery shop and buy a clay jar. Then take along some of the city officials and leading priests"
Jeremiah,19,2,"and go to Hinnom Valley, just outside Potsherd Gate. Tell the people that I have said:"
Jeremiah,19,3,"I am the LORD All-Powerful, the God of Israel, and you kings of Judah and you people of Jerusalem had better pay attention. I am going to bring so much trouble on this valley that everyone who hears about it will be shocked."
Jeremiah,20,1,"Pashhur son of Immer was a priest and the chief of temple security. He heard what I had said,"
Jeremiah,20,2,and so he hit me. Then he had me arrested and put in chains at the Benjamin Gate in the LORD 's temple.
Jeremiah,20,3,"The next day, when Pashhur let me go free, I told him that the LORD had said: No longer will I call you Pashhur. Instead, I will call you Afraid-of-Everything."
Jeremiah,20,4,"You will be afraid, and you will bring fear to your friends as well. You will see enemies kill them in battle. Then I will make the king of Babylonia take everyone in Judah prisoner, killing some and dragging the rest away to Babylonia."
Jeremiah,20,5,He will clean out the royal treasury and take everything else of value from Jerusalem.
Jeremiah,20,6,"Pashhur, you are guilty of telling lies and claiming they were messages from me. That's why I will make the Babylonians take you, your family, and your friends as prisoners to Babylonia, where you will all die and be buried."
Jeremiah,20,7,"You tricked me, LORD, and I was really fooled. You are stronger than I am, and you have defeated me. People never stop sneering and insulting me."
Jeremiah,20,8,You have let me announce only destruction and death. Your message has brought me nothing but insults and trouble.
Jeremiah,20,9,"Sometimes I tell myself not to think about you, LORD, or even mention your name. But your message burns in my heart and bones, and I cannot keep silent."
Jeremiah,20,10,"I heard the crowds whisper, “Everyone is afraid. Now's our chance to accuse Jeremiah!” All of my so called friends are just waiting for me to make a mistake. They say, “Perhaps Jeremiah can be tricked. Then we can overpower him and get even at last.”"
Jeremiah,20,11,"But you, LORD, are a mighty soldier, standing at my side. Those troublemakers will fall down and fail— terribly embarrassed, for ever ashamed."
Jeremiah,20,12," LORD All-Powerful, you test those who do right, and you know every heart and mind. I have told you my complaints, so let me watch you take revenge on my enemies."
Jeremiah,20,13,"I sing praises to you, LORD. You rescue the oppressed from the wicked."
Jeremiah,20,14,Put a curse on the day I was born! Don't bless my mother.
Jeremiah,20,15,"Put a curse on the man who told my father, “Good news! You have a son.”"
Jeremiah,20,16,May that man be like the towns you destroyed without pity. Let him hear shouts of alarm in the morning and battle cries at midday.
Jeremiah,20,17,He deserves to die for not killing me before I was born. Then my mother's body would have been my grave.
Jeremiah,20,18,Why did I have to be born? Was it just to suffer and die in shame?
Jeremiah,21,1,"King Zedekiah of Judah sent for Pashhur son of Malchiah and for a priest named Zephaniah son of Maaseiah. Then he told them, “Talk with Jeremiah for me.” So they came to me and said,"
Jeremiah,21,2,"“King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia has attacked Judah. Please ask the LORD to work miracles for our people, as he has done in the past, so that Nebuchadnezzar will leave us alone.”"
Jeremiah,23,1,You leaders of my people are like shepherds that kill and scatter the sheep.
Jeremiah,23,2,"You were supposed to take care of my people, but instead you chased them away. So now I'll really take care of you, and believe me, you will pay for your crimes!"
Jeremiah,23,3,"I will bring the rest of my people home from the lands where I have scattered them, and they will grow into a mighty nation."
Jeremiah,23,4,"I promise to choose leaders who will care for them like real shepherds. All my people will be there, and they will never again be frightened."
Jeremiah,23,5,"Some day I will appoint an honest king from the family of David, a king who will be wise and rule with justice."
Jeremiah,23,6,"As long as he is king, Israel will have peace, and Judah will be safe. The name of this king will be “The LORD Gives Justice”."
Jeremiah,23,7,A time will come when you will again worship me. But you will no longer call me the Living God who rescued Israel from Egypt.
Jeremiah,23,8,"Instead, you will call me the Living God who rescued you from the land in the north and from all the other countries where I had forced you to go. And you will once again live in your own land."
Jeremiah,23,9,"When I think of the prophets, I am shocked, and I tremble like someone drunk, because of the LORD and his sacred words."
Jeremiah,23,10,Those unfaithful prophets misuse their power all over the country. So God turned the pasture lands into scorching deserts.
Jeremiah,23,11,"The LORD told me to say: You prophets and priests think so little of me, the LORD, that you even sin in my own temple!"
Jeremiah,23,12,"Now I will punish you with disaster, and you will slip and fall in the darkness. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Jeremiah,23,13,"The prophets in Samaria were disgusting to me, because they preached in the name of Baal and led my people astray."
Jeremiah,23,14,And you prophets in Jerusalem are even worse. You're unfaithful in marriage and never tell the truth. You even lead others to sin instead of helping them turn back to me. You and the people of Jerusalem are evil like Sodom and Gomorrah.
Jeremiah,23,15,"You prophets in Jerusalem have spread evil everywhere. That's why I, the LORD , promise to give you bitter poison to eat and drink."
Jeremiah,23,16,"Don't listen to the lies of these false prophets, you people of Judah! The message they preach is something they imagined; it did not come from me, the LORD All-Powerful."
Jeremiah,23,17,"These prophets go to people who refuse to respect me and who are stubborn and do whatever they want. The prophets tell them, “The LORD has promised everything will be fine.”"
Jeremiah,23,18,"But I, the LORD , tell you that these prophets have never attended a meeting of my council in heaven or heard me speak."
Jeremiah,23,19,They are evil! So in my anger I will strike them like a violent storm.
Jeremiah,23,20,"I won't calm down, until I have finished what I have decided to do. Some day you will understand exactly what I mean."
Jeremiah,23,21,"I did not send these prophets or speak to them, but they ran to find you and to preach their message."
Jeremiah,23,22,"If they had been in a meeting of my council in heaven, they would have told you people of Judah to give up your sins and come back to me."
Jeremiah,23,23,"I am everywhere— both near and far,"
Jeremiah,23,24,in heaven and on earth. There are no secret places where you can hide from me.
Jeremiah,23,25,"These unfaithful prophets claim that I have given them a dream or a vision, and then they tell lies in my name."
Jeremiah,23,26,But everything they say comes from their own twisted minds. How long can this go on?
Jeremiah,23,27,"They tell each other their dreams and try to get my people to reject me, just as their ancestors left me and worshipped Baal."
Jeremiah,23,28,"Their dreams and my truth are as different as straw and wheat. But when prophets speak for me, they must say only what I have told them."
Jeremiah,23,29,My words are a powerful fire; they are a hammer that shatters rocks.
Jeremiah,24,1,"The LORD spoke to me in a vision after King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia had come to Judah and taken King Jehoiachin, his officials, and all the skilled workers back to Babylonia. In this vision I saw two baskets of figs in front of the LORD 's temple."
Jeremiah,24,2,"One basket was full of very good figs that ripened early, and the other was full of rotten figs that were not fit to eat."
Jeremiah,24,3,"“Jeremiah,” the LORD asked, “what do you see?” “Figs,” I said. “Some are very good, but the others are too rotten to eat.”"
Jeremiah,24,4,Then the LORD told me to say:
Jeremiah,24,5,"People of Judah, the good figs stand for those of you I sent away as exiles to Babylonia,"
Jeremiah,24,6,"where I am watching over them. Then some day I will bring them back to this land. I will plant them, instead of uprooting them, and I will build them up, rather than tearing them down."
Jeremiah,24,7,"I will give them a desire to know me and to be my people. They will want me to be their God, and they will turn back to me with all their heart."
Jeremiah,24,8,"The rotten figs stand for King Zedekiah of Judah, his officials, and all the others who were not taken away to Babylonia, whether they stayed here in Judah or went to live in Egypt."
Jeremiah,24,9,"I will punish them with a terrible disaster, and everyone on earth will tremble when they hear about it. I will force the people of Judah to go to foreign countries, where they will be cursed and insulted."
Jeremiah,24,10,"War and hunger and disease will strike them, until they finally disappear from the land that I gave them and their ancestors."
Jeremiah,26,1,"Soon after Jehoiakim became king of Judah, the LORD said:"
Jeremiah,26,2,"Jeremiah, I have a message for everyone who comes from the towns of Judah to worship in my temple. Go to the temple courtyard and speak every word that I tell you."
Jeremiah,26,3,"Perhaps the people will listen this time. And if they stop doing wrong, I will change my mind and not punish them for their sins."
Jeremiah,26,4,Tell them that I have said: You have refused to listen to me and to obey my laws and teachings.
Jeremiah,26,5,"Again and again I have sent my servants the prophets to preach to you, but you ignored them as well. Now I am warning you that if you don't start obeying me straight away,"
Jeremiah,26,6,"I will destroy this temple, just as I destroyed the town of Shiloh. Then everyone on earth will use the name “Jerusalem” as a curse word."
Jeremiah,26,7,"The prophets, the priests, and everyone else in the temple heard what I said,"
Jeremiah,28,1,"Later that same year, in the fifth month of the fourth year that Zedekiah was king, the prophet Hananiah son of Azzur from Gibeon came up to me in the temple. And while the priests and others in the temple were listening,"
Jeremiah,28,2,"he told me that the LORD had said: I am the LORD All-Powerful, the God of Israel, and I will smash the yoke that Nebuchadnezzar put on the necks of the nations to make them his slaves."
Jeremiah,28,3,"And within two years, I will bring back to Jerusalem everything that he took from my temple and carried off to Babylonia."
Jeremiah,28,4,King Jehoiachin and the other people who were taken from Judah to Babylonia will be allowed to come back here as well. All this will happen because I will smash the power of the king of Babylonia!
Jeremiah,28,5,"The priests and the others were still standing there, so I said:"
Jeremiah,28,6,"Hananiah, I hope the LORD will do exactly what you said. I hope he does bring back everything the Babylonians took from the temple, and that our people who were taken to Babylonia will be allowed to return home."
Jeremiah,28,7,But let me remind you and everyone else
Jeremiah,28,8,"that long before we were born, prophets were saying powerful kingdoms would be struck by war, disaster, and disease."
Jeremiah,28,9,Now you are saying we will have peace. We will just have to wait and see if that is really what the LORD has said.
Jeremiah,28,10,Hananiah grabbed the wooden yoke from my neck and smashed it.
Jeremiah,28,11,"Then he said, “The LORD says this is the way he will smash the power Nebuchadnezzar has over the nations, and it will happen in less than two years.” I left the temple,"
Jeremiah,28,12,"and a little while later, the LORD told me"
Jeremiah,31,1,"The LORD said: Israel, I promise that some day all your tribes will again be my people, and I will be your God."
Jeremiah,31,2,"In the desert I was kind to those who escaped death. I gave them peace, and when the time is right, I'll do the same for you. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Jeremiah,31,3,"Some time ago, the LORD appeared to me and told me to say: Israel, I will always love you; that's why I've been so patient and kind."
Jeremiah,31,4,"You are precious to me, and so I will rebuild your nation. Once again you will dance for joy and play your tambourines."
Jeremiah,31,5,You will plant vineyards on the hills of Samaria and enjoy the grapes.
Jeremiah,31,6,"Some day those who guard the hill country of Ephraim will shout, “Let's go to Zion and worship the LORD our God.”"
Jeremiah,31,7,"The LORD says: Celebrate and sing for Israel, the greatest of nations. Offer praises and shout, “Come and rescue your people, LORD! Save what's left of Israel.”"
Jeremiah,31,8,"I, the LORD , will bring my people back from Babylonia and everywhere else on earth. The blind and the lame will be there. Expectant mothers and women about to give birth will come and be part of that great crowd."
Jeremiah,31,9,"They will weep and pray as I bring them home. I will lead them to streams of water. They will walk on a level road and not stumble. I am a father to Israel, my favourite children."
Jeremiah,31,10,"Listen to me, you nations nearby or across the sea. I scattered the people of Israel, but I will gather them again. I will protect them like a shepherd guarding a flock;"
Jeremiah,31,11,I will rescue them from enemies who could overpower them.
Jeremiah,31,12,"My people will come to Mount Zion and celebrate; their faces will glow because of my blessings. I'll give them grain, grapes, and olive oil, as well as sheep and cattle. Israel will be prosperous and grow like a garden with plenty of water."
Jeremiah,31,13,"Young women and young men, together with the elderly, will celebrate and dance, because I will comfort them and turn their sorrow into happiness."
Jeremiah,31,14,"I will bless my people with more food than they need, and the priests will enjoy the choice cuts of meat. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Jeremiah,31,15,"In Ramah a voice is heard, crying and weeping loudly. Rachel mourns for her children and refuses to be comforted, because they are dead."
Jeremiah,32,1,"The LORD spoke to me in the tenth year that Zedekiah was king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year that Nebuchadnezzar was king of Babylonia."
Jeremiah,32,2,"At that time, the Babylonian army had surrounded Jerusalem, and I was in the prison at the courtyard of the palace guards."
Jeremiah,32,3,"Zedekiah had ordered me to be held there because I told everyone that the LORD had said: I am the LORD , and I am about to let the king of Babylonia conquer Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,32,4,"King Zedekiah will be captured and taken to King Nebuchadnezzar, who will speak with him face to face."
Jeremiah,32,5,"Then Zedekiah will be led away to Babylonia, where he will stay until I have finished with him. So, if you people of Judah fight against the Babylonians, you will lose. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Jeremiah,32,6,"Later, when I was in prison, the LORD said:"
Jeremiah,32,7,"Jeremiah, your cousin Hanamel, the son of your uncle Shallum, will visit you. He must sell his field near the town of Anathoth, and because you are his nearest relative, you have the right and the responsibility to buy it and keep it in the family."
Jeremiah,32,8,"Hanamel came, just as the LORD had promised. And he said, “Please buy my field near Anathoth in the territory of the Benjamin tribe. You have the right to buy it, and if you do, it will stay in our family.” The LORD had told me to buy it"
Jeremiah,32,9,"from Hanamel, and so I did. The price was seventeen pieces of silver, and I weighed out the full amount on a scale."
Jeremiah,34,1,"King Nebuchadnezzar had a large army made up of people from every kingdom in his empire. He and his army were attacking Jerusalem and all the nearby towns, when the LORD told me"
Jeremiah,34,2,"to say to King Zedekiah: I am the LORD , and I am going to let Nebuchadnezzar capture this city and burn it down."
Jeremiah,34,3,"You will be taken prisoner and brought to Nebuchadnezzar, and he will speak with you face to face. Then you will be led away to Babylonia."
Jeremiah,34,4,"Zedekiah, I promise that you won't die in battle."
Jeremiah,34,5,"You will die a peaceful death. People will mourn when you die, and they will light bonfires in your honour, just as they did for your ancestors, the kings who ruled before you."
Jeremiah,34,6,I went to Zedekiah and told him what the LORD had said.
Jeremiah,34,7,"Meanwhile, the king of Babylonia was trying to break through the walls of Lachish, Azekah, and Jerusalem, the only three towns of Judah that had not been captured."
Jeremiah,35,1,"When Jehoiakim was king of Judah, the LORD told me,"
Jeremiah,35,2,"“Go to the Rechabite clan and invite them to meet you in one of the side rooms of the temple. When they arrive, offer them a drink of wine.”"
Jeremiah,35,3,"So I went to Jaazaniah, the leader of the clan, and I invited him and all the men of his clan."
Jeremiah,35,4,"I brought them into the temple courtyard and took them upstairs to a room belonging to the prophets who were followers of Hanan son of Igdaliah. It was next to a room belonging to some of the officials, and that room was over the one belonging to Maaseiah, a priest who was one of the high officials in the temple."
Jeremiah,35,5,"I set out some large bowls full of wine together with some cups, and then I said to the Rechabites, “Have some wine!”"
Jeremiah,35,6,"But they answered: No! The ancestor of our clan, Jonadab son of Rechab, made a rule that we must obey. He said, “Don't ever drink wine"
Jeremiah,35,7,"or build houses or plant crops and vineyards. Instead, you must always live in tents and move from place to place. If you obey this command, you will live a long time.”"
Jeremiah,36,1,"During the fourth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was king of Judah, the LORD said to me, “Jeremiah,"
Jeremiah,36,2,"since the time Josiah was king, I have been speaking to you about Israel, Judah, and the other nations. Now, get a scroll and write down everything I have told you,"
Jeremiah,36,3,"then read it to the people of Judah. Perhaps they will stop sinning when they hear what terrible things I plan for them. And if they turn to me, I will forgive them.”"
Jeremiah,36,4,"I sent for Baruch son of Neriah and asked him to help me. I repeated everything the LORD had told me, and Baruch wrote it all down on a scroll."
Jeremiah,36,5,"Then I said, Baruch, the officials refuse to let me go into the LORD 's temple,"
Jeremiah,36,6,so you must go instead. Wait for the next holy day when the people of Judah come to the temple to pray and to go without eating. Then take this scroll to the temple and read it aloud.
Jeremiah,36,7,"The LORD is furious, and if the people hear how he is going to punish them, perhaps they will ask to be forgiven."
Jeremiah,37,1,King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia had removed Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim from being the king of Judah and had made Josiah's son Zedekiah king instead.
Jeremiah,37,2,"But Zedekiah, his officials, and everyone else in Judah ignored everything the LORD had told me."
Jeremiah,38,1,"One day, Shephatiah, Gedaliah, Jehucal, and Pashhur heard me tell the people of Judah"
Jeremiah,40,1,"I was led away in chains along with the people of Judah and Jerusalem who were being taken to Babylonia. Nebuzaradan was the officer in charge of the guard, and when we stopped at Ramah, the LORD made him set me free."
Jeremiah,40,2,"Nebuzaradan said: Jeremiah, the LORD your God warned your people that he would bring disaster on this land."
Jeremiah,40,3,"But they continued to rebel against him, and now he has punished them just as he threatened."
Jeremiah,40,4,"Today I am taking the chains off your wrists and setting you free! If you want to, you can come with me to Babylonia, and I will see that you are taken care of. Or if you decide to stay here, you can go wherever you wish."
Jeremiah,40,5,"King Nebuchadnezzar has chosen Gedaliah to rule Judah. You can live near Gedaliah, and he will provide for you, or you can live anywhere else you want. Nebuzaradan gave me a supply of food, then let me leave."
Jeremiah,40,6,"I decided to stay with the people of Judah, and I went to live near Gedaliah in Mizpah."
Jeremiah,41,1,"But in the seventh month, Ishmael came to Mizpah with ten of his soldiers. He had been one of the king's officials and was a member of the royal family. Ishmael and his men were invited to eat with Gedaliah."
Jeremiah,41,2,"During the meal, Ishmael and his soldiers killed Gedaliah, the man chosen as ruler of Judah by the king of Babylonia."
Jeremiah,41,3,"Then they killed the Jews who were with Gedaliah, and they also killed the Babylonian soldiers who were there."
Jeremiah,41,4,"The next day, the murders had still not been discovered,"
Jeremiah,41,5,"when eighty men came down the road towards Mizpah from the towns of Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria. They were on their way to the temple to offer gifts of grain and incense to the LORD . They had shaved off their beards, torn their clothes, and cut themselves, because they were mourning."
Jeremiah,41,6,"Ishmael went out of the town gate to meet them. He pretended to be weeping, and he asked them to come into Mizpah to meet with Gedaliah, the ruler of Judah."
Jeremiah,41,7,"But after they were inside the town, Ishmael ordered his soldiers to kill them and throw their bodies into a well."
Jeremiah,41,8,"He let ten of the men live, because they offered to give him supplies of wheat, barley, olive oil, and honey they had hidden in a field."
Jeremiah,41,9,"The well that he filled with bodies had been dug by King Asa of Judah to store rainwater, because he was afraid that King Baasha of Israel might surround Mizpah and keep the people from getting to their water supply."
Jeremiah,41,10,"Nebuzaradan, King Nebuchadnezzar's officer in charge of the guard, had left King Zedekiah's daughters and many other people at Mizpah, and he had put Gedaliah in charge of them. But now Ishmael took them all prisoner and led them towards Ammon, on the other side of the River Jordan."
Jeremiah,41,11,Johanan and the other army officers heard what Ishmael had done.
Jeremiah,41,12,So they and their troops chased Ishmael and caught up with him at the large pit at Gibeon.
Jeremiah,41,13,"When Ishmael's prisoners saw Johanan and the officers, they were happy"
Jeremiah,41,14,and turned round and ran towards Johanan.
Jeremiah,41,15,But Ishmael and eight of his men escaped and went to Ammon.
Jeremiah,41,16,"Johanan and the officers had rescued the women, children, and royal officials whom Ishmael had taken prisoner after killing Gedaliah. Johanan led the people from Gibeon"
Jeremiah,42,1,"Johanan, Jezaniah, the other army officers, and everyone else in the group, came to me"
Jeremiah,42,2,"and said, “Please pray to the LORD your God for us. Judah used to have many people, but as you can see, only a few of us are left."
Jeremiah,42,3,Ask the LORD to tell us where he wants us to go and what he wants us to do.”
Jeremiah,42,4,"“All right,” I answered, “I will pray to the LORD your God, and I will tell you everything he says.”"
Jeremiah,42,5,"They answered, “The LORD himself will be our witness that we promise to do whatever he says,"
Jeremiah,42,6,even if it isn't what we want to do. We will obey the LORD so that all will go well for us.”
Jeremiah,42,7,"Ten days later, the LORD gave me an answer for"
Jeremiah,42,8,"Johanan, the officers, and the other people. So I called them together"
Jeremiah,42,9,and told them that the LORD God of Israel had said: You asked Jeremiah to pray and find out what you should do.
Jeremiah,42,10,"I am sorry that I had to punish you, and so I now tell you to stay here in Judah, where I will plant you and build you up, instead of tearing you down and uprooting you."
Jeremiah,42,11,"Don't be afraid of the King of Babylonia. I will protect you from him,"
Jeremiah,42,12,and I will even force him to have mercy on you and give back your farms.
Jeremiah,42,13,"But you might keep on saying, “We won't stay here in Judah, and we won't obey the LORD our God."
Jeremiah,42,14,"We are going to Egypt, where there is plenty of food and no danger of war.”"
Jeremiah,42,15,"People of Judah, you survived when the Babylonian army attacked. Now you are planning to move to Egypt, and if you do go, this is what will happen."
Jeremiah,43,1,I told the people everything the LORD had told me.
Jeremiah,43,2,"But Azariah, Johanan and some other arrogant men said to me, “You're lying! The LORD didn't tell you to say that we shouldn't go to Egypt."
Jeremiah,43,3,"Baruch son of Neriah must have told you to say that. He wants the Babylonians to capture us, so they can take us away to Babylonia or even kill us.”"
Jeremiah,43,4,"Johanan, the other army officers, and everyone else refused to stay in Judah in spite of the LORD 's command."
Jeremiah,43,5,So Johanan and the officers led us away towards Egypt. The group that left Judah included those who had been scattered in other countries and who had then come back to live in Judah.
Jeremiah,43,6,"Baruch and I and others in the group had been staying with Gedaliah, because Nebuzaradan, the Babylonian officer in charge of the guard, had ordered him to take care of the king's daughters and quite a few men, women, and children."
Jeremiah,43,7,"The people disobeyed the LORD and went to Egypt. The group had settled in Tahpanhes,"
Jeremiah,43,8,when the LORD told me:
Jeremiah,43,9,"Jeremiah, carry some large stones to the entrance of the government building in Tahpanhes. Bury the stones underneath the brick pavement and be sure the Jews are watching."
Jeremiah,43,10,"Then tell them that I, the LORD All-Powerful, the God of Israel, have sent for my servant, Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia. I will bring him here and make him set up his throne and his royal tent over these stones that I told you to bury."
Jeremiah,43,11,He will attack Egypt and kill many of its people; others will die of disease or be dragged away as prisoners.
Jeremiah,44,1,"The LORD told me to speak with the Jews who were living in the towns of Migdol, Tahpanhes, and Memphis in northern Egypt, and also to those living in southern Egypt. He told me to tell them:"
Jeremiah,44,2,"I am the LORD All-Powerful, the God of Israel. You saw how I destroyed Jerusalem and the towns of Judah. They lie empty and in ruins today,"
Jeremiah,44,3,because the people of Judah made me angry by worshipping gods that had never helped them or their ancestors.
Jeremiah,44,4,"Time after time I sent my servants the prophets to tell the people of Judah how much I hated their disgusting sins. The prophets warned them to stop sinning,"
Jeremiah,44,5,but they refused to listen and would not stop worshipping other gods.
Jeremiah,44,6,"Finally, my anger struck like a raging flood, and today Jerusalem and the towns of Judah are nothing but empty ruins."
Jeremiah,44,7,"Why do you now insist on heading for another disaster? A disaster that will destroy not only you, but also your children and babies."
Jeremiah,44,8,"You have made me angry by worshipping idols and burning incense to other gods after you came here to Egypt. You will die such a disgusting death, that other nations will use the name of Judah as a curse word."
Jeremiah,44,9,"When you were living in Jerusalem and Judah, you followed the example of your ancestors in doing evil things, just like your kings and queens."
Jeremiah,44,10,"Even now, your pride keeps you from respecting me and obeying the laws and teachings I gave you and your ancestors."
Jeremiah,44,11,"I, the LORD All-Powerful, have decided to wipe you out with disasters."
Jeremiah,44,12,"There were only a few of you left in Judah, and you decided to go to Egypt. But you will die such horrible deaths in war or from starvation, that people of other countries will use the name of Judah as a curse word."
Jeremiah,44,13,"I punished Jerusalem with war, hunger, and disease, and that's how I will punish you."
Jeremiah,44,14,"None of you will survive. You may hope to return to Judah some day, but only a very few of you will escape death and be able to go back."
Jeremiah,44,15,A large number of Jews from both northern and southern Egypt listened to me as I told them what the LORD had said. Most of the men in the crowd knew that their wives often burnt incense to other gods. So they and their wives shouted:
Jeremiah,44,16,"Jeremiah, what do we care if you speak in the LORD 's name? We refuse to listen!"
Jeremiah,44,17,"We have promised to worship the goddess Astarte, the Queen of Heaven, and that is exactly what we are going to do. We will burn incense and offer sacrifices of wine to her, just as we, our ancestors, our kings, and our leaders did when we lived in Jerusalem and the other towns of Judah. We had plenty of food back then. We were well off, and nothing bad ever happened to us."
Jeremiah,44,18,"But since the time we stopped burning incense and offering wine sacrifices to her, we have been dying from war and hunger."
Jeremiah,44,19,"Then the women said, “When we lived in Judah, we worshipped the Queen of Heaven and offered sacrifices of wine and special loaves of bread shaped like her. Our husbands knew what we were doing, and they approved of it.”"
Jeremiah,44,20,Then I told the crowd:
Jeremiah,44,21,"Don't you think the LORD knew that you and your ancestors, your leaders and kings, and the rest of the people were burning incense to other gods in Jerusalem and everywhere else in Judah?"
Jeremiah,44,22,"And when he could no longer put up with your disgusting sins, he placed a curse on your land and turned it into a desert, as it is today."
Jeremiah,44,23,This disaster happened because you worshipped other gods and rebelled against the LORD by refusing to obey him or follow his laws and teachings.
Jeremiah,45,1,"In the fourth year that Jehoiakim was king of Judah, Baruch wrote down everything I had told him."
Jeremiah,45,2,"Then later, the LORD God of Israel told me to say to Baruch:"
Jeremiah,45,3,"You are moaning and blaming me, the LORD , for your troubles and sorrow, and for being so tired that you can't even rest."
Jeremiah,45,4,But all over the earth I am tearing down what I built and pulling up what I planted.
Jeremiah,45,5,"I am bringing disaster everywhere, so don't even think about making any big plans for yourself. However, I promise that wherever you go, I will at least protect you from death. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Jeremiah,46,1,The LORD often told me what to say about the different nations of the world.
Jeremiah,46,2,"In the fourth year that Jehoiakim was king of Judah, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia defeated King Neco of Egypt in a battle at the city of Carchemish near the River Euphrates. And here is what the LORD told me to say about the Egyptian army:"
Jeremiah,46,3,"It's time to go into battle! So grab your shields,"
Jeremiah,46,4,"saddle your horses, and polish your spears. Put on your helmets and armour, then take your positions."
Jeremiah,46,5,"I can see the battle now— you are defeated and running away, never once looking back. Terror is all around."
Jeremiah,46,6,"You are strong and run fast, but you can't escape. You fall in battle near the River Euphrates."
Jeremiah,46,7,"What nation is this, that rises like the River Nile overflowing its banks?"
Jeremiah,46,8,"It is Egypt, rising with a roar like a raging river and saying, “I'll flood the earth, destroying cities, and killing everyone in them.”"
Jeremiah,46,9,"Go ahead, Egypt. Tell your chariots and cavalry to attack and fight hard. Order your troops to march out, with Ethiopians and Libyans carrying shields, and the Lydians armed with bows and arrows."
Jeremiah,46,10,"But the LORD All-Powerful will win this battle and take revenge on his enemies. His sword will eat them and drink their blood until it is full. They will be killed in the north near the River Euphrates, as a sacrifice to the LORD."
Jeremiah,46,11,"Egypt, no medicine can heal you, not even the soothing lotion from Gilead."
Jeremiah,46,12,"All nations have heard you weep; you are disgraced, and they know it. Your troops fall to the ground, stumbling over each other."
Jeremiah,47,1,"Before the king of Egypt attacked the town of Gaza, the LORD told me to say to the Philistines:"
Jeremiah,47,2,"I, the LORD , tell you that your land will be flooded with an army from the north. It will destroy your towns and sweep you away, moaning and screaming."

Jeremiah,48,1,"The LORD All-Powerful, the God of Israel, told me to say to the nation of Moab: The town of Nebo is doomed; Kiriathaim will be captured and disgraced, and even its fortress will be left in ruins."
Jeremiah,48,2,"No one honours you, Moab. In Heshbon, enemies make plans to end your life. My sword will leave only silence in your town named “Quiet”."
Jeremiah,48,3,"The people of Horonaim will cry for help, as their town is attacked and destroyed."
Jeremiah,48,4,Moab will be shattered! Your children will sob
Jeremiah,48,5,and cry on their way up to the town of Luhith; on the road to Horonaim they will tell of disasters.
Jeremiah,48,6,Run for your lives! Head into the desert like a wild donkey.
Jeremiah,48,7,"You thought you could be saved by your power and wealth, but you will be captured along with your god Chemosh, his priests, and officials."
Jeremiah,48,8,"Not one of your towns will escape destruction. I have told your enemies, “Wipe out the valley and the flat lands of Moab."
Jeremiah,48,9,"Spread salt on the ground to kill the crops. Leave its towns in ruins, with no one living there."
Jeremiah,48,10,"I want you to kill the Moabites, and if you let them escape, I will put a curse on you.”"
Jeremiah,48,11,"Moab, you are like wine left to settle undisturbed, never poured from jar to jar. And so, your nation continues to prosper and improve."
Jeremiah,48,12,"But now, I will send enemies to pour out the wine and smash the jars!"
Jeremiah,48,13,"Then you will be ashamed, because your god Chemosh cannot save you, just as Bethel could not help the Israelites."
Jeremiah,48,14,You claim that your soldiers are strong and brave.
Jeremiah,48,15,"But I am the LORD, the all-powerful King, and I promise that enemies will overpower your towns. Even your best warriors will die in the battle."
Jeremiah,48,16,It won't be long now— disaster will hit Moab!

Jeremiah,49,1,The LORD has this to say about the nation of Ammon: The people of Israel have plenty of children to inherit their lands. So why have you worshippers of the god Milcom taken over towns and land belonging to the Gad tribe?
Jeremiah,49,2,"Some day I will send an army to attack you in Rabbah, your capital city. It will be left in ruins, and the surrounding villages will lie in ashes. You took some of Israel's land, but on that day Israel will take yours!"
Jeremiah,49,3,"Cry, people of Heshbon; your town will become a pile of rubble. You will turn here and there, but your path will be blocked. Put on sackcloth and mourn, you citizens of Rabbah, because the idol you worship will be taken to a foreign country, along with its priests and temple officials."

Jeremiah,51,10,"The people of Israel said, “Tell everyone in Zion! The LORD has taken revenge for what Babylon did to us.”"

Jeremiah,51,21,"to shatter cavalry and chariots,"

Jeremiah,51,64,"“This is how Babylon will sink when the LORD destroys it. Everyone in the city will die, and it won't have the strength to rise again.” Jeremiah's writing ends here."
Jeremiah,52,1,"Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he was appointed king of Judah, and he ruled from Jerusalem for eleven years. His mother Hamutal was the daughter of Jeremiah from the town of Libnah."
Jeremiah,52,2,"Zedekiah disobeyed the LORD , just as Jehoiakim had done,"
Jeremiah,52,3,and it was Zedekiah who finally rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar. The people of Judah and Jerusalem had made the LORD so angry that he finally turned his back on them. That's why horrible things were happening.
Jeremiah,52,4,"In Zedekiah's ninth year as king, on the tenth day of the tenth month, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia led his entire army to attack Jerusalem. The troops set up camp outside the city and built ramps up to the city walls."
