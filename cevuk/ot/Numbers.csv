Numbers,1,1,"The people of Israel had left Egypt and were living in the Sinai Desert. Then on the first day of the second month of the second year, Moses was in the sacred tent when the LORD said:"
Numbers,2,1,The LORD told Moses and Aaron
Numbers,2,2,"how the Israelites should arrange their camp: Each tribe must set up camp under its own banner and under the flags of its ancestral families. These camps will be arranged around the sacred tent, but not close to it."
Numbers,3,1,"When the LORD talked with Moses on Mount Sinai,"
Numbers,3,2,"Aaron's four sons, Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar,"
Numbers,3,3,were the ones to be ordained as priests.
Numbers,3,4,"But the LORD killed Nadab and Abihu in the Sinai Desert when they used fire that was unacceptable in their offering to the LORD. And because Nadab and Abihu had no sons, only Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests with their father Aaron."
Numbers,3,5,The LORD said to Moses:
Numbers,3,6,Assign the Levi tribe to Aaron the priest. They will be his assistants
Numbers,3,7,and will work at the sacred tent for him and for all the Israelites.
Numbers,3,8,The Levites will serve the community by being responsible for the furnishings of the tent.
Numbers,3,9,"They are assigned to help Aaron and his sons,"
Numbers,3,10,who have been appointed to be priests. Anyone else who tries to perform the duties of a priest must be put to death.
Numbers,4,1,The LORD told Moses and Aaron:
Numbers,5,1,The LORD told Moses
Numbers,6,1,The LORD told Moses
Numbers,6,2,"to say to the people of Israel: If any of you want to dedicate yourself to me by vowing to become a Nazirite,"
Numbers,6,3,you must no longer drink any wine or beer or use any kind of vinegar. Don't drink grape juice or eat grapes or raisins—
Numbers,6,4,not even the seeds or skins.
Numbers,6,5,"Even the hair of a Nazirite is sacred to me, and as long as you are a Nazirite, you must never cut your hair."
Numbers,6,6,"During the time that you are a Nazirite, you must never go close to a dead body,"
Numbers,7,1,"When Moses had finished setting up the sacred tent, he dedicated it to the LORD , together with its furnishings, the altar, and its equipment."
Numbers,7,2,"Then the twelve tribal leaders of Israel, the same men who had been in charge of counting the people, came to the tent"
Numbers,7,3,with gifts for the LORD . They brought six strong carts and twelve oxen—one ox from each leader and a cart from every two.
Numbers,7,4,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,7,5,"“Accept these gifts, so the Levites can use them here at the sacred tent for carrying the sacred things.”"
Numbers,7,6,"Then Moses took the carts and oxen and gave them to the Levites,"
Numbers,8,1,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,8,2,“Tell Aaron to put the seven lamps on the lampstand so they shine towards the front.”
Numbers,8,3,Aaron obeyed and placed the lamps as he was told.
Numbers,8,4,"The lampstand was made of hammered gold from its base to the decorative flowers on top, exactly like the pattern the LORD had described to Moses."
Numbers,8,5,The LORD said to Moses:
Numbers,8,6,The Levites must be acceptable to me before they begin working at the sacred tent. So separate them from the rest of the Israelites
Numbers,8,7,and sprinkle them with the water that washes away their sins. Then tell them to shave their entire bodies and wash their clothes.
Numbers,8,8,They are to bring a bull and its proper grain sacrifice of flour mixed with olive oil. And they must bring a second bull as a sacrifice for sin.
Numbers,8,9,"Then you, Moses, will call together all the people of Israel and make the Levites go to my sacred tent,"
Numbers,8,10,where the people will place their hands on them.
Numbers,8,11,"Aaron will present the Levites to me as a gift from the people, so that the Levites will do my work."
Numbers,8,12,"After this, the Levites are to place their hands on the heads of the bulls. Then one of the bulls will be sacrificed for the forgiveness of sin, and the other to make sure that I am pleased."
Numbers,8,13,"The Levites will stand at my altar in front of Aaron and his sons, who will then dedicate the Levites to me."
Numbers,8,14,This ceremony will show that the Levites are different from the other Israelites and belong to me in a special way.
Numbers,8,15,"After they have been made acceptable and have been dedicated, they will be allowed to work at my sacred tent."
Numbers,8,16,They are mine and will take the place of the firstborn Israelite sons.
Numbers,8,17,"When I killed the eldest sons of the Egyptians, I decided that the firstborn sons in each Israelite family would be mine, as well as every firstborn male from their flocks and herds."
Numbers,8,18,"But now I have chosen these Levites as substitutes for the firstborn sons,"
Numbers,8,19,and I have given them as gifts to Aaron and his sons to serve at the sacred tent. I will hold them responsible for what happens to anyone who gets too close to the sacred tent.
Numbers,8,20,"Moses, Aaron, and the other Israelites made sure that the Levites did everything the LORD had commanded."
Numbers,8,21,The Levites sprinkled themselves with the water of forgiveness and washed their clothes. Then Aaron brought them to the altar and offered sacrifices to forgive their sins and make them acceptable to the LORD.
Numbers,8,22,"After this, the Levites worked at the sacred tent as assistants to Aaron and his sons, just as the LORD had commanded."
Numbers,8,23,"The LORD also told Moses,"
Numbers,9,1,"During the first month of Israel's second year in the Sinai Desert, the LORD had told Moses"
Numbers,9,2,"to say to the people, “Celebrate Passover"
Numbers,9,3,in the evening of the fourteenth day of this month and do it by following all the regulations.”
Numbers,10,1,The LORD told Moses:
Numbers,10,2,Have two trumpets made out of hammered silver. These will be used to call the people together and to give the signal for moving your camp.
Numbers,10,3,"If both trumpets are blown, everyone is to meet with you at the entrance to the sacred tent."
Numbers,10,4,"But if just one is blown, only the twelve tribal leaders need to come together."
Numbers,11,1,One day the Israelites started complaining about their troubles. The LORD heard them and became so angry that he destroyed the outer edges of their camp with fire.
Numbers,11,2,"When the people begged Moses to help, he prayed, and the fire went out."
Numbers,11,3,"They named the place “Burning”, because in his anger the LORD had set their camp on fire."
Numbers,11,4,"One day some worthless foreigners among the Israelites became greedy for food, and even the Israelites themselves began moaning, “We don't have any meat!"
Numbers,11,5,"In Egypt we could eat all the fish we wanted, and there were cucumbers, melons, onions, and garlic."
Numbers,11,6,"But we're starving out here, and the only food we have is this manna.”"
Numbers,11,7,The manna was like small whitish seeds
Numbers,13,1,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,13,2,“Choose a leader from each tribe and send them into Canaan to explore the land I am giving you.”
Numbers,13,3,So Moses sent twelve tribal leaders from Israel's camp in the Paran Desert
Numbers,14,1,"After the Israelites heard the report from the twelve men who had explored Canaan, the people cried all night"
Numbers,14,2,"and complained to Moses and Aaron, “We wish we had died in Egypt or somewhere out here in the desert!"
Numbers,14,3,"Is the LORD leading us into Canaan, just to have us killed and our women and children captured? We'd be better off in Egypt.”"
Numbers,14,4,"Then they said to one another, “Let's choose our own leader and go back.”"
Numbers,14,5,Moses and Aaron bowed down to pray in front of the crowd.
Numbers,14,6,Joshua and Caleb tore their clothes in sorrow
Numbers,14,7,"and said: We saw the land ourselves, and it's very good."
Numbers,14,8,"If we obey the LORD , he will surely give us that land rich with milk and honey."
Numbers,14,9,"So don't rebel. We have no reason to be afraid of the people who live there. The LORD is on our side, and they won't stand a chance against us!"
Numbers,14,10,"The crowd threatened to stone Moses and Aaron to death. But just then, the LORD appeared in a cloud at the sacred tent."
Numbers,14,11,"The LORD said to Moses, “I have done great things for these people, and they still reject me by refusing to believe in my power."
Numbers,14,12,"So they will no longer be my people. I will destroy them, but I will make you the ancestor of a nation even stronger than theirs.”"
Numbers,15,1,The LORD told Moses
Numbers,15,2,to give the Israelites the following laws about offering sacrifices:
Numbers,15,3,"Bulls or rams or goats are the animals that you may burn on the altar as sacrifices to please me. You may also offer sacrifices voluntarily or because you made a promise, or because they are part of your regular religious ceremonies. The smell of the smoke from these sacrifices is pleasing to me."
Numbers,17,1,The LORD told Moses:
Numbers,18,1,"The LORD said to Aaron: You, your sons, and the other Levites of the Kohath clan, are responsible for what happens at the sacred tent. And you and your sons will be responsible for what the priests do."
Numbers,18,2,The Levites are your relatives and are here to help you in your service at the tent.
Numbers,18,3,"You must see that they perform their duties. But if they go near any of the sacred objects or the altar, all of you will die."
Numbers,18,4,No one else is allowed to take care of the sacred tent or to do anything connected with it.
Numbers,18,5,"Follow these instructions, so I won't become angry and punish the Israelites ever again."
Numbers,18,6,"I alone chose the Levites from all the other tribes to belong to me, and I have given them to you as your helpers."
Numbers,18,7,"But only you and your sons can serve as priests at the altar and in the most holy place. Your work as priests is a gift from me, and anyone else who tries to do that work must be put to death."
Numbers,20,1,The people of Israel arrived at the Zin Desert during the first month and set up camp near the town of Kadesh. It was there that Miriam died and was buried.
Numbers,20,2,"The Israelites had no water, so they went to Moses and Aaron"
Numbers,20,3,"and complained, “Moses, we'd be better off if we had died along with the others in front of the LORD 's sacred tent."
Numbers,20,4,"You brought us into this desert, and now we and our livestock are going to die!"
Numbers,20,5,Egypt was better than this horrible place. At least there we had grain and figs and grapevines and pomegranates. But now we don't even have any water.”
Numbers,20,6,"Moses and Aaron went to the entrance to the sacred tent, where they bowed down. The LORD appeared to them in all his glory"
Numbers,21,1,"The Canaanite king of Arad lived in the Southern Desert of Canaan, and when he heard that the Israelites were on their way to the village of Atharim, he attacked and took some of them hostage."
Numbers,21,2,"The Israelites prayed, “Our LORD , if you will help us defeat these Canaanites, we will completely destroy their towns and everything in them, to show that they belong to you.”"
Numbers,21,3,"The LORD answered their prayer and helped them wipe out the Canaanite army and completely destroy their towns. That's why one of the towns is named Hormah, which means “Destroyed Place”."
Numbers,21,4,"The Israelites had to go around the territory of Edom, so when they left Mount Hor, they headed south towards the Red Sea. But along the way, the people became so impatient"
Numbers,21,5,"that they complained against God and said to Moses, “Did you bring us out of Egypt, just to let us die in the desert? There's no water out here, and we can't stand this awful food!”"
Numbers,21,6,Then the LORD sent poisonous snakes that bit and killed many of them.
Numbers,21,7,"Some of the people went to Moses and admitted, “It was wrong of us to insult you and the LORD . Now please ask him to make these snakes go away.” Moses prayed,"
Numbers,21,8,"and the LORD answered, “Make a snake out of bronze and place it on top of a pole. Anyone who gets bitten can look at the snake and won't die.”"
Numbers,21,9,"Moses obeyed the LORD . And all of those who looked at the bronze snake lived, even though they had been bitten by the poisonous snakes."
Numbers,21,10,"As the Israelites continued their journey to Canaan, they camped at Oboth,"
Numbers,21,11,"then at Iye-Abarim in the desert east of Moab,"
Numbers,21,12,and then in the Zered Gorge.
Numbers,21,13,"After that, they crossed the gorge of the River Arnon and camped in the Moabite desert bordering Amorite territory. The Arnon was the border between the Moabites and the Amorites."
Numbers,21,14,"A song in The Book of the LORD 's Battles mentions the town of Waheb with its creeks in the territory of Suphah. It also mentions the River Arnon,"
Numbers,21,15,with its valleys that lie beside the Moabite border and extend to the town of Ar.
Numbers,21,16,"From the Arnon, the Israelites went to the well near the town of Beer, where the LORD had said to Moses, “Call the people together, and I will give them water to drink.”"
Numbers,21,17,That's also the same well the Israelites sang about in this song: Let's celebrate! The well has given us water.
Numbers,21,18,"With their royal sceptres, our leaders pointed out where to dig the well. The Israelites left the desert and camped near the town of Mattanah,"
Numbers,21,19,"then at Nahaliel, and then at Bamoth."
Numbers,21,20,"Finally, they reached Moabite territory, where they camped near Mount Pisgah in a valley overlooking the desert north of the Dead Sea."
Numbers,21,21,The Israelites sent this message to King Sihon of the Amorites:
Numbers,21,22,"Please let us pass through your territory. We promise to stay away from your fields and vineyards, and we won't drink any water from your wells. As long as we're in your land, we won't get off the main road."
Numbers,21,23,"But Sihon refused to let Israel travel through his land. Instead, he called together his entire army and marched into the desert to attack Israel near the town of Jahaz."
Numbers,21,24,"Israel defeated them and took over the Amorite territory from the gorge of the River Arnon in the south to the gorge of the River Jabbok in the north. Beyond the Jabbok was the territory of the Ammonites, who were much stronger than Israel."
Numbers,21,25,"The Israelites settled in the Amorite towns, including the capital city of Heshbon with its surrounding villages."
Numbers,21,26,"King Sihon had ruled from Heshbon, after defeating the Moabites and taking over their land north of the Arnon gorge."
Numbers,21,27,"That's why the Amorites had written this poem about Heshbon: Come and rebuild Heshbon, King Sihon's capital city!"
Numbers,21,28,"His armies marched out like fiery flames, burning down the town of Ar and destroying the hills along the River Arnon."
Numbers,21,29,"You Moabites are done for! Your god Chemosh deserted your people; they were captured, taken away by King Sihon the Amorite."
Numbers,21,30,"We completely defeated Moab. The towns of Heshbon and Dibon, of Nophah and Medeba are ruined and gone."
Numbers,21,31,"After the Israelites had settled in the Amorite territory,"
Numbers,21,32,"Moses sent some men to explore the town of Jazer. Later, the Israelites captured the villages surrounding it and forced out the Amorites who lived there."
Numbers,21,33,"The Israelites headed towards the region of Bashan, where King Og ruled, and he led his entire army to Edrei to meet Israel in battle."
Numbers,21,34,"The LORD said to Moses, “Don't be afraid of Og. I will help you defeat him and his army, just as you did King Sihon who ruled in Heshbon. Og's territory will be yours.”"
Numbers,21,35,"So the Israelites wiped out Og, his family, and his entire army—there were no survivors. Then Israel took over the land of Bashan."
Numbers,22,1,"Israel moved from there to the hills of Moab, where they camped across the River Jordan from the town of Jericho."
Numbers,23,1,"Balaam said to Balak, “Build seven altars here, then bring seven bulls and seven rams.”"
Numbers,23,2,"After Balak had done this, they sacrificed a bull and a ram on each altar."
Numbers,23,3,"Then Balaam said, “Wait here beside your offerings, and I'll go somewhere to be alone. Perhaps the LORD will appear to me. If he does, I will tell you everything he says.” And he left."
Numbers,23,4,"When God appeared to him, Balaam said, “I have built seven altars and have sacrificed a bull and a ram on each one.”"
Numbers,23,5,"The LORD gave Balaam a message, then sent him back to tell Balak."
Numbers,23,6,"When Balaam returned, he found Balak and his officials standing beside the offerings."
Numbers,23,7,Balaam said: “King Balak of Moab brought me from the hills of Syria to curse Israel and announce its doom.
Numbers,23,8,But I can't go against God! He did not curse or condemn Israel.
Numbers,23,9,"“From the mountain peaks, I look down and see Israel, the obedient people of God."
Numbers,23,10,"They are living alone in peace. And though they are many, they don't bother the other nations. “I hope to obey God for as long as I live and to die in such peace.”"
Numbers,23,11,"Balak said, “What are you doing? I asked you to come and place a curse on my enemies. But you have blessed them instead!”"
Numbers,23,12,"Balaam answered, “I can say only what the LORD tells me.”"
Numbers,23,13,"Balak said to Balaam, “Let's go somewhere else. Perhaps if you see a smaller part of the Israelites, you will be able to curse them for me.”"
Numbers,23,14,So he took Balaam to a field on top of Mount Pisgah where lookouts were stationed. Then he built seven altars there and sacrificed a bull and a ram on each one.
Numbers,23,15,"“Wait here beside your offerings,” Balaam said. “The LORD will appear to me over there.”"
Numbers,23,16,"The LORD appeared to Balaam and gave him another message, then he told him to go and tell Balak."
Numbers,23,17,"Balaam went back and saw him and his officials standing beside the offerings. Balak asked, “What did the LORD say?”"
Numbers,23,18,Balaam answered: “Pay close attention to my words—
Numbers,23,19,God is no mere human! He doesn't tell lies or change his mind. God always keeps his promises.
Numbers,23,20,"“My command from God was to bless these people, and there's nothing I can do to change what he has done."
Numbers,23,21,Israel's king is the LORD God. He lives there with them and intends them no harm.
Numbers,23,22,"With the strength of a wild ox, God led Israel out of Egypt."
Numbers,23,23,No magic charms can work against them— just look what God has done for his people.
Numbers,23,24,They are like angry lions ready to attack; and they won't rest until their victim is gobbled up.”
Numbers,23,25,"Balak shouted, “If you're not going to curse Israel, then at least don't bless them.”"
Numbers,23,26,"“I've already told you,” Balaam answered. “I will say only what the LORD tells me.”"
Numbers,23,27,"Balak said to Balaam, “Come on, let's try another place. Perhaps God will let you curse Israel from there.”"
Numbers,23,28,So he took Balaam to Mount Peor overlooking the desert north of the Dead Sea.
Numbers,23,29,"Balaam said, “Build seven altars here, then bring me seven bulls and seven rams.”"
Numbers,23,30,"After Balak had done what Balaam asked, he sacrificed a bull and a ram on each altar."
Numbers,24,1,"Balaam was sure that the LORD would tell him to bless Israel again. So he did not use any magic to find out what the LORD wanted him to do, as he had the first two times. Instead, he looked out towards the desert"
Numbers,24,2,"and saw the tribes of Israel camped below. Just then, God's Spirit took control of him,"
Numbers,24,3,"and Balaam said: “I am the son of Beor, and my words are true, so listen to my message!"
Numbers,24,4,"It comes from the LORD, the God All-Powerful. I bowed down to him and saw a vision of Israel."
Numbers,24,5,"“People of Israel, your camp is lovely."
Numbers,24,6,"It's like a grove of palm trees or a garden beside a river. You are like tall aloe trees that the LORD has planted, or like cedars growing near water."
Numbers,24,7,You and your descendants will prosper like an orchard beside a stream. Your king will rule with power and be a greater king than Agag the Amalekite.
Numbers,24,8,"With the strength of a wild ox, God led you out of Egypt. You will defeat your enemies, shooting them with arrows and crushing their bones."
Numbers,24,9,"Like a lion you lie down, resting after an attack. Who would dare disturb you? “Anyone who blesses you will be blessed; anyone who curses you will be cursed.”"
Numbers,24,10,"When Balak heard this, he was so furious that he pounded his fist against his hand and said, “I called you here to place a curse on my enemies, and you've blessed them three times."
Numbers,24,11,"Leave now and go home! I told you I would pay you well, but since the LORD didn't let you do what I asked, you won't be paid.”"
Numbers,24,12,"Balaam answered, “I told your messengers"
Numbers,24,13,"that even if you offered me a palace full of silver or gold, I would still obey the LORD . And I explained that I would say only what he told me."
Numbers,24,14,"So I'm going back home, but I'm leaving you with a warning about what the Israelites will some day do to your nation.”"
Numbers,24,15,"Balaam said: “I am the son of Beor, and my words are true, so listen to my message!"
Numbers,24,16,"My knowledge comes from God Most High, the LORD All-Powerful. I bowed down to him and saw a vision of Israel."
Numbers,24,17,"“What I saw in my vision hasn't happened yet. But some day, a king of Israel will appear like a star. He will wipe out you Moabites and destroy those tribes who live in the desert."
Numbers,24,18,Israel will conquer Edom and capture the land of that enemy nation.
Numbers,24,19,The king of Israel will rule and destroy the survivors of every town there.
Numbers,24,20,"“And I saw this vision about the Amalekites: Their nation is now great, but it will some day disappear for ever."
Numbers,24,21,"“And this is what I saw about the Kenites: They think they're safe, living among the rocks,"
Numbers,24,22,but they will be wiped out when Assyria conquers them.
Numbers,24,23,“No one can survive if God plans destruction.
Numbers,24,24,"Ships will come from Cyprus, bringing people who will invade the lands of Assyria and Eber. But finally, Cyprus itself will be ruined.”"
Numbers,24,25,"After Balaam finished, he started home, and Balak also left."
Numbers,25,1,"While the Israelites were camped at Acacia, some of the men had sex with Moabite women."
Numbers,25,2,These women then invited the men to ceremonies where sacrifices were offered to their gods. The men ate the meat from the sacrifices and worshipped the Moabite gods.
Numbers,25,3,The LORD was angry with Israel because they had worshipped the god Baal-Peor.
Numbers,25,4,"So he said to Moses, “Take the Israelite leaders who are responsible for this and have them killed in front of my sacred tent where everyone can see. Perhaps then I will stop being angry with the Israelites.”"
Numbers,25,5,"Moses told Israel's officials, “Each of you must put to death any of your men who worshipped Baal.”"
Numbers,25,6,"Later, Moses and the people were at the sacred tent, crying, when one of the Israelite men brought a Midianite woman to meet his family."
Numbers,25,7,"Phinehas, the grandson of Aaron the priest, saw the couple and left the crowd. He found a spear"
Numbers,25,8,"and followed the man into his tent, where he ran the spear through the man and into the woman's stomach. The LORD immediately stopped punishing Israel with a deadly disease,"
Numbers,25,9,but twenty-four thousand Israelites had already died.
Numbers,25,10,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,25,11,"“In my anger, I would have wiped out the Israelites if Phinehas had not been faithful to me."
Numbers,26,1,"After the LORD had stopped the deadly disease from killing the Israelites, he said to Moses and Eleazar son of Aaron,"
Numbers,26,2,“I want you to find out how many Israelites are in each family. And list every man twenty years and older who is able to serve in Israel's army.”
Numbers,26,3,Israel was now camped in the hills of Moab across the River Jordan from the town of Jericho. Moses and Eleazar told them
Numbers,26,4,"what the LORD had said about counting the men twenty years and older, just as Moses and their ancestors had done when they left Egypt."
Numbers,27,1,"Zelophehad was from the Manasseh tribe, and he had five daughters, whose names were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah."
Numbers,27,2,"One day his daughters went to the sacred tent, where they met with Moses, Eleazar, and some other leaders of Israel, as well as a large crowd of Israelites. The young women said:"
Numbers,27,3,"You know that our father died in the desert. But it was for something he did wrong, not for joining with Korah in rebelling against the LORD. Our father left no sons"
Numbers,27,4,"to carry on his family name. But why should his name die out for that reason? Give us some land like the rest of his relatives in our clan, so our father's name can live on."
Numbers,27,5,"Moses asked the LORD what should be done,"
Numbers,27,6,and the LORD answered:
Numbers,27,7,Zelophehad's daughters are right. They should each be given part of the land their father would have received.
Numbers,27,8,"Tell the Israelites that when a man dies without a son, his daughter will inherit his land."
Numbers,27,9,"If he has no daughter, his brothers will inherit the land."
Numbers,27,10,"But if he has no brothers, his father's brothers will inherit the land."
Numbers,27,11,"And if his father has no brothers, the land must be given to his nearest relative in the clan. This is my law, and the Israelites must obey it."
Numbers,27,12,"The LORD said to Moses, “One day you will go up into the Abarim Mountains, and from there you will see the land I am giving the Israelites."
Numbers,27,13,"After you have seen it, you will die, just like your brother Aaron,"
Numbers,27,14,"because both of you disobeyed me at Meribah near the town of Kadesh in the Zin Desert. When the Israelites insulted me there, you didn't believe in my holy power.”"
Numbers,27,15,"Moses replied,"
Numbers,27,16,"“You are the LORD God, and you know what is in everyone's heart. So I ask you to appoint a leader for Israel."
Numbers,27,17,"Your people need someone to lead them into battle, or else they will be like sheep wandering around without a shepherd.”"
Numbers,27,18,"The LORD answered, “Joshua son of Nun can do the job. Place your hands on him to show that he is the one to take your place."
Numbers,27,19,Then go with him and make him stand in front of Eleazar the priest and the Israelites. Appoint Joshua as their new leader
Numbers,27,20,"and tell them they must now obey him, just as they obey you."
Numbers,27,21,But Joshua must depend on Eleazar to find out from me what I want him to do as he leads Israel into battle.”
Numbers,27,22,"Moses followed the LORD 's instructions and took Joshua to Eleazar and the people,"
Numbers,27,23,then he placed his hands on Joshua and appointed him Israel's leader.
Numbers,28,1,The LORD told Moses
Numbers,28,2,"to say to the people of Israel: Offer sacrifices to me at the appointed times of worship, so that I will smell the smoke and be pleased."
Numbers,28,3,Each day offer two rams a year old as sacrifices to please me. The animals must have nothing wrong with them;
Numbers,28,4,"one will be sacrificed in the morning, and the other in the evening."
Numbers,28,5,"Along with each of them, one kilogramme of your finest flour mixed with a litre of olive oil must be offered as a grain sacrifice."
Numbers,28,6,This sacrifice to please me was first offered on Mount Sinai.
Numbers,28,7,"Finally, along with each of these two sacrifices, a litre of wine must be poured on the altar as a drink offering."
Numbers,28,8,"The second ram will be sacrificed that evening, along with the other offerings, just like the one sacrificed that morning. The smell of the smoke from these sacrifices will please me."
Numbers,29,1,"On the first day of the seventh month, you must rest from your work and come together to celebrate at the sound of the trumpets."
Numbers,29,2,"Bring to the altar one bull, one full-grown ram, and seven rams a year old that have nothing wrong with them. And then offer these as sacrifices to please me."
Numbers,29,3,"Three kilogrammes of your finest flour mixed with olive oil must be offered with the bull as a grain sacrifice. Two kilogrammes of flour mixed with oil must be offered with the ram,"
Numbers,29,4,and one kilogramme of flour mixed with oil must be offered with each of the young rams.
Numbers,29,5,You must also offer a goat as a sacrifice for sin.
Numbers,29,6,These sacrifices will be made in addition to the regular daily sacrifices and the sacrifices for the first day of the month. The smoke from these sacrifices will please me.
Numbers,29,7,"The tenth day of the seventh month is the Great Day of Forgiveness. On that day you must rest from all work and come together for worship. Show sorrow for your sins by going without food,"
Numbers,29,8,"and bring to the altar one young bull, one full-grown ram, and seven rams a year old that have nothing wrong with them. Then offer these as sacrifices to please me."
Numbers,29,9,"Three kilogrammes of your finest flour mixed with olive oil must be offered with the bull as a grain sacrifice. Two kilogrammes of flour mixed with oil must be offered with the ram,"

Numbers,30,1,The LORD told Moses to say to Israel's tribal leaders:
Numbers,30,2,"When one of you men makes a promise to the LORD, you must keep your word."
Numbers,30,3,Suppose a young woman who is still living with her parents makes a promise to the LORD.
Numbers,30,4,"If her father hears about it and says nothing, she must keep her promise."
Numbers,30,5,"But if he hears about it and objects, then she no longer has to keep her promise. The LORD will forgive her, because her father did not agree with the promise."
Numbers,31,1,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,31,2,"“Before you die, make sure that the Midianites are punished for what they did to Israel.”"
Numbers,31,3,"Then Moses told the people, “The LORD wants to punish the Midianites. So tell our men to prepare for battle."
Numbers,31,4,Each tribe will send a thousand men to fight.”
Numbers,31,5,"Twelve thousand men were picked from the tribes of Israel, and after they were prepared for battle,"
Numbers,31,6,Moses sent them off to war. Phinehas the son of Eleazar went with them and took along some things from the sacred tent and the trumpets for sounding the battle signal.
Numbers,31,7,"The Israelites fought against the Midianites, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. They killed all the men,"
Numbers,31,8,"including Balaam son of Beor and the five Midianite kings, Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba."
Numbers,31,9,"The Israelites captured every woman and child, then led away the Midianites' cattle and sheep, and took everything else that belonged to them."
Numbers,31,10,They also burnt down the Midianite towns and villages.
Numbers,31,11,"Israel's soldiers gathered together everything they had taken from the Midianites, including the captives and the animals."
Numbers,32,1,"The tribes of Reuben and Gad owned a lot of cattle and sheep, and they saw that the regions of Jazer and Gilead had good pasture land."
Numbers,32,2,"So they went to Moses, Eleazar, and the other leaders of Israel and said,"
Numbers,33,1,"As Israel travelled from Egypt under the command of Moses and Aaron,"
Numbers,33,2,"Moses kept a list of the places where they camped, just as the LORD had instructed. Here is the record of their journey:"
Numbers,34,1,The LORD told Moses
Numbers,34,2,to tell the people of Israel that their land in Canaan would have the following borders:
Numbers,34,3,The southern border will be the Zin Desert and the north-west part of Edom. This border will begin at the south end of the Dead Sea.
Numbers,34,4,"It will go west from there, but will turn southward to include Scorpion Pass, the village of Zin, and the town of Kadesh-Barnea. From there, the border will continue to Hazar-Addar and on to Azmon."
Numbers,34,5,It will run along the Egyptian Gorge and end at the Mediterranean Sea.
Numbers,34,6,The western border will be the Mediterranean Sea.
Numbers,34,7,"The northern border will begin at the Mediterranean, then continue eastward to Mount Hor."
Numbers,34,8,"After that, it will run to Lebo-Hamath and across to Zedad, which is the northern edge of your land."
Numbers,34,9,"From Zedad, the border will continue east to Ziphron and end at Hazar-Enan."
Numbers,34,10,"The eastern border will begin at Hazar-Enan in the north, then run south to Shepham,"
Numbers,34,11,"and on down to Riblah on the east side of Ain. From there, it will go south to the eastern hills of Lake Galilee,"
Numbers,34,12,then follow the River Jordan down to the north end of the Dead Sea. The land within those four borders will belong to you.
Numbers,34,13,"Then Moses told the people, “You will receive the land inside these borders. It will be yours, but the LORD has commanded you to divide it among the nine and a half tribes."
Numbers,34,14,"The tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh have already been given their land"
Numbers,34,15,"across from Jericho, east of the River Jordan.”"
Numbers,34,16,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,34,17,“Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun will divide the land for the Israelites.
Numbers,34,18,"One leader from each tribe will help them,"
Numbers,35,1,"While the people of Israel were still camped in the lowlands of Moab across the River Jordan from Jericho, the LORD told Moses"
Numbers,35,2,"to say to them: When you receive your tribal lands, you must give towns and pastures to the Levi tribe."
Numbers,35,3,"That way, the Levites will have towns to live in and pastures for their animals."
Numbers,36,1,One day the family leaders from the Gilead clan of the Manasseh tribe went to Moses and the other family leaders of Israel
Numbers,36,2,"and said, “Sir, the LORD has said that he will show what land each tribe will receive as their own. And the LORD has commanded you to give the daughters of our relative Zelophehad the land that he would have received."
Numbers,36,3,"But if they marry men from other tribes of Israel, the land they receive will become part of that tribe's inheritance and will no longer belong to us."
Numbers,36,4,"Even when land is returned to its original owner in the Year of Celebration, we will not get back Zelophehad's land—it will belong to the tribe into which his daughters married.”"
Numbers,36,5,So Moses told the people that the LORD had said: These men from the Manasseh tribe are right.
Numbers,36,6,"I will allow Zelophehad's daughters to marry anyone, as long as those men belong to one of the clans of the Manasseh tribe."
Numbers,36,7,Tribal land must not be given to another tribe—it will remain the property of the tribe that received it.
