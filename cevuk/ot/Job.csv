Job,1,1,"Many years ago, a man named Job lived in the land of Uz. He was a truly good person, who respected God and refused to do evil."
Job,1,2,Job had seven sons and three daughters.
Job,1,3,"He owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred pair of oxen, five hundred donkeys, and a large number of servants. He was the richest person in the East."
Job,1,4,"Job's sons took turns having feasts in their homes, and they always invited their three sisters to join in the eating and drinking."
Job,1,5,"After each feast, Job would send for his children and perform a ceremony, as a way of asking God to forgive them for any wrongs they might have done. He would get up early the next morning and offer a sacrifice for each of them, just in case they had sinned or silently cursed God."
Job,1,6,"One day, when the angels had gathered around the LORD , and Satan was there with them,"
Job,1,7,"the LORD asked, “Satan, where have you been?” Satan replied, “I have been going all over the earth.”"
Job,1,8,"Then the LORD asked, “What do you think of my servant Job? No one on earth is like him—he is a truly good person, who respects me and refuses to do evil.”"
Job,1,9,“Why shouldn't he respect you?” Satan remarked.
Job,1,10,"“You are like a wall protecting not only him, but his entire family and all his property. You make him successful in whatever he does, and his flocks and herds are everywhere."
Job,1,11,"Try taking away everything he owns, and he will curse you to your face.”"
Job,1,12,"The LORD replied, “All right, Satan, do what you want with anything that belongs to him, but don't harm Job.” Then Satan left."
Job,1,13,"Job's sons and daughters were having a feast in the home of his eldest son,"
Job,1,14,"when someone rushed up to Job and said, “While your servants were ploughing with your oxen, and your donkeys were nearby eating grass,"
Job,1,15,"a gang of Sabeans attacked and stole the oxen and donkeys! Your other servants were killed, and I was the only one who escaped to tell you.”"
Job,1,16,"That servant was still speaking, when a second one came running up and saying, “God sent down a fire that killed your sheep and your servants. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”"
Job,1,17,"Before that servant finished speaking, a third one raced up and said, “Three gangs of Chaldeans attacked and stole your camels! All your other servants were killed, and I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”"
Job,1,18,"That servant was still speaking, when a fourth one dashed up and said, “Your children were having a feast and drinking wine at the home of your eldest son,"
Job,1,19,"when suddenly a storm from the desert blew the house down, crushing all your children. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”"
Job,1,20,"When Job heard this, he tore his clothes and shaved his head because of his great sorrow. He knelt on the ground, then worshipped God"
Job,1,21,and said: “We bring nothing at birth; we take nothing with us at death. The LORD alone gives and takes. Praise the name of the LORD !”
Job,1,22,"In spite of everything, Job did not sin or accuse God of doing wrong."
Job,2,1,"When the angels gathered around the LORD again, Satan was there with them,"
Job,2,2,"and the LORD asked, “Satan, where have you been?” Satan replied, “I have been going all over the earth.”"
Job,2,3,"Then the LORD asked, “What do you think of my servant Job? No one on earth is like him—he is a truly good person, who respects me and refuses to do evil. And he hasn't changed, even though you persuaded me to destroy him for no reason.”"
Job,2,4,"Satan answered, “There's no pain like your own. People will do anything to stay alive."
Job,2,5,"Try striking Job's own body with pain, and he will curse you to your face.”"
Job,2,6,"“All right!” the LORD replied. “Make Job suffer as much as you want, but just don't kill him.”"
Job,2,7,Satan left and caused painful sores to break out all over Job's body—from head to toe.
Job,2,8,"Then Job sat on the ash heap to show his sorrow. And while he was scraping his sores with a broken piece of pottery,"
Job,2,9,"his wife asked, “Why do you still trust God? Why don't you curse him and die?”"
Job,2,10,"Job replied, “Don't talk like a fool! If we accept blessings from God, we must accept trouble as well.” In all that happened, Job never once said anything against God."
Job,2,11,"Eliphaz from Teman, Bildad from Shuah, and Zophar from Naamah were three of Job's friends, and they heard about his troubles. So they agreed to visit Job and comfort him."
Job,2,12,"When they came near enough to see Job, they could hardly recognize him. And in their great sorrow, they tore their clothes, then sprinkled dust on their heads and cried bitterly."
Job,2,13,"For seven days and nights, they sat silently on the ground beside him, because they realized what terrible pain he was in."
Job,3,1,"Finally, Job cursed the day of his birth"
Job,3,2,by saying to God:
Job,3,3,Blot out the day of my birth and the night when my parents created a son.
Job,3,4,"Forget about that day, cover it with darkness,"
Job,3,5,"and send thick, gloomy shadows to fill it with dread."
Job,3,6,Erase that night from the calendar and conceal it with darkness.
Job,3,7,Don't let children be created or joyful shouts be heard ever again in that night.
Job,3,8,Let those with magic powers place a curse on that day.
Job,3,9,"Darken its morning stars and remove all hope of light,"
Job,3,10,because it let me be born into a world of trouble.
Job,3,11,Why didn't I die at birth?
Job,3,12,Why was I accepted and allowed to nurse at my mother's breast?
Job,3,13,Now I would be at peace in the silent world below
Job,3,14,"with kings and their advisers whose palaces lie in ruins,"
Job,3,15,and with rulers once rich with silver and gold.
Job,3,16,"I wish I had been born dead and then buried, never to see the light of day."
Job,3,17,"In the world of the dead, the wicked and the weary rest without a worry."
Job,4,1,Eliphaz from Teman said:
Job,4,2,Please be patient and listen to what I have to say.
Job,5,1,"Job, call out for help and see if an angel comes!"
Job,5,2,Envy and jealousy will kill a stupid fool.
Job,5,3,"I have seen fools take root. But God sends a curse, suddenly uprooting them"
Job,5,4,and leaving their children helpless in court.
Job,5,5,Then hungry and greedy people gobble up their crops and grab their wealth.
Job,5,6,Our suffering isn't caused by the failure of crops;
Job,5,7,"it's all part of life, like sparks shooting skyward."
Job,5,8,"Job, if I were you, I would ask God for help."
Job,5,9,"His miracles are marvellous, more than we can count."
Job,5,10,God sends showers on earth and waters the fields.
Job,5,11,He protects the sorrowful and lifts up those who have been disgraced.
Job,6,1,Job said:
Job,6,2,It's impossible to weigh my misery and grief!
Job,6,3,"They outweigh the sand along the beach, and that's why I have spoken without thinking first."
Job,6,4,The fearsome arrows of God All-Powerful have filled my soul with their poison.
Job,6,5,Do oxen and wild donkeys cry out in distress unless they are hungry?
Job,6,6,What is food without salt? What is more tasteless than the white of an egg?
Job,6,7,"That's how my food tastes, and my appetite is gone."
Job,7,1,Why is life so hard? Why do we suffer?
Job,7,2,We are slaves in search of shade; we are labourers longing for our wages.
Job,7,3,God has made my days drag on and my nights miserable.
Job,7,4,"I pray for night to end, but it stretches out while I toss and turn."
Job,7,5,"My parched skin is covered with worms, dirt, and sores,"
Job,7,6,and my days are running out quicker than the thread of a fast-moving needle.
Job,7,7,"I beg you, God, don't forget! My life is just a breath, and trouble lies ahead."
Job,7,8,"I will vanish from sight, and no one, including you, will ever see me again."
Job,7,9,I will disappear in the grave or vanish from sight like a passing cloud.
Job,7,10,Never will I return home; soon I will be forgotten.
Job,7,11,"And so, I cry out to you in agony and distress."
Job,7,12,Am I the sea or a sea monster? Is that why you imprison me?
Job,7,13,"I go to bed, hoping for rest,"
Job,7,14,but you torture me with terrible dreams.
Job,8,1,Bildad from Shuah said:
Job,8,2,How long will you talk and keep saying nothing?
Job,8,3,Does God All-Powerful stand in the way of justice?
Job,8,4,He made your children pay for their sins.
Job,8,5,So why don't you turn to him
Job,8,6,and start living right? Then he will decide to rescue and restore you to your place of honour.
Job,8,7,Your future will be brighter by far than your past.
Job,8,8,"Our ancestors were wise, so learn from them."
Job,8,9,"Our own time has been short, like a fading shadow, and we know very little."
Job,8,10,But they will instruct you with great understanding.
Job,8,11,"Papyrus reeds grow healthy only in a swamp,"
Job,8,12,"and if the water dries up, they die sooner than grass."
Job,8,13,Such is the hopeless future of all who turn from God
Job,8,14,and trust in something as frail as a spider's web—
Job,8,15,they take hold and fall because it's so flimsy.
Job,8,16,Sinful people are like plants with spreading roots and plenty of sun and water.
Job,8,17,They wrap their roots tightly around rocks.
Job,8,18,"But once they are pulled up, they have no more place;"
Job,8,19,"their life slips away, and other plants grow there."
Job,8,20,We know God doesn't reject an innocent person or help a sinner.
Job,8,21,"And so, he will make you happy and give you something to smile about."
Job,8,22,But your evil enemies will be put to shame and disappear for ever.
Job,9,1,Job said:
Job,9,2,What you say is true. No human is innocent in the sight of God.
Job,9,3,Not once in a thousand times could we win our case if we took him to court.
Job,9,4,God is wise and powerful— who could possibly oppose him and win?
Job,9,5,"When God becomes angry, he can move mountains before they even know it."
Job,9,6,God can shake the earth loose from its foundations
Job,9,7,or command the sun and stars to hold back their light.
Job,9,8,"God alone stretched out the sky, stepped on the sea,"
Job,9,9,"and set the stars in place— the Great Bear and Orion, the Pleiades and the stars in the southern sky."
Job,9,10,"Of all the miracles God works, we cannot understand a single one."
Job,9,11,"God walks right past me, without making a sound."
Job,9,12,"And if he grabs something, who can stop him or raise a question?"
Job,9,13,"When God showed his anger, the servants of the sea monster fell at his feet."
Job,9,14,"How, then, could I possibly argue my case with God?"
Job,9,15,"Even though I am innocent, I can only beg for mercy."
Job,9,16,"And if God came into court when I called him, he would not hear my case."
Job,9,17,He would strike me with a storm and increase my injuries for no reason at all.
Job,9,18,"Before I could get my breath, my miseries would multiply."
Job,9,19,"God is much stronger than I am, and who would call me into court to give me justice?"
Job,9,20,"Even if I were innocent, God would prove me wrong."
Job,9,21,"I am not guilty, but I no longer care what happens to me."
Job,9,22,What difference does it make? God destroys the innocent along with the guilty.
Job,9,23,"When a good person dies a sudden death, God sits back and laughs."
Job,9,24,"And who else but God blindfolds the judges, then lets the wicked take over the earth?"
Job,9,25,"My life is speeding by, without a hope of happiness."
Job,9,26,Each day passes swifter than a sailing ship or an eagle swooping down.
Job,9,27,"Sometimes I try to be cheerful and to stop complaining,"
Job,9,28,"but my sufferings frighten me, because I know that God still considers me guilty."
Job,9,29,So what's the use of trying to prove my innocence?
Job,9,30,"Even if I washed myself with the strongest soap,"
Job,9,31,"God would throw me into a pit of stinking slime, leaving me disgusting to my clothes."
Job,9,32,God isn't a mere human like me. I can't put him on trial.
Job,9,33,Who could possibly judge between the two of us?
Job,9,34,Can someone snatch away the stick God carries to frighten me?
Job,9,35,"Then I could speak up without fear of him, but for now, I cannot speak."
Job,10,1,"I am sick of life! And from my deep despair, I complain to you, my God."
Job,10,2,Don't just condemn me! Point out my sin.
Job,10,3,Why do you take such delight in destroying those you created and in smiling on sinners?
Job,10,4,Do you look at things the way we humans do?
Job,10,5,Is your life as short as ours?
Job,10,6,Is that why you are so quick to find fault with me?
Job,10,7,"You know I am innocent, but who can defend me against you?"
Job,10,8,Will you now destroy someone you created?
Job,10,9,Remember that you moulded me like a piece of clay. So don't turn me back into dust once again.
Job,10,10,"As cheese is made from milk, you created my body from a tiny drop."
Job,10,11,Then you tied my bones together with muscles and covered them with flesh and skin.
Job,10,12,"You, the source of my life, showered me with kindness and watched over me."
Job,10,13,"You have not explained all your mysteries,"
Job,10,14,but you catch and punish me each time I sin.
Job,10,15,"Guilty or innocent, I am condemned and ashamed because of my troubles."
Job,10,16,"No matter how hard I try, you keep hunting me down like a powerful lion."
Job,10,17,You never stop accusing me; you become furious and attack over and over again.
Job,10,18,Why did you let me be born? I would rather have died before birth
Job,10,19,and been carried to the grave without ever breathing.
Job,10,20,"I have only a few days left. Why don't you leave me alone? Let me find some relief,"
Job,11,1,Zophar from Naamah said:
Job,11,2,So much foolish talk cannot go unanswered.
Job,11,3,Your words have silenced others and made them ashamed; now it is only right for you to be put to shame.
Job,11,4,You claim to be innocent and argue that your beliefs are acceptable to God.
Job,11,5,But I wish he would speak
Job,11,6,and let you know that wisdom has many different sides. You would then discover that God has punished you less than you deserve.
Job,11,7,Can you understand the mysteries surrounding God All-Powerful?
Job,11,8,"They are higher than the heavens and deeper than the grave. So what can you do when you know so little,"
Job,11,9,and these mysteries outreach the earth and the sea?
Job,11,10,"If God puts you in prison or drags you to court, what can you do?"
Job,11,11,"God has the wisdom to know when someone is worthless and sinful,"
Job,11,12,but it's easier to tame a wild donkey than to make a fool wise.
Job,11,13,"Surrender your heart to God, turn to him in prayer,"
Job,11,14,and give up your sins— even those you do in secret.
Job,11,15,Then you won't be ashamed; you will be confident and fearless.
Job,11,16,"Your troubles will go away like water beneath a bridge,"
Job,11,17,and your darkest night will be brighter than midday.
Job,11,18,"You will rest safe and secure, filled with hope and emptied of worry."
Job,11,19,You will sleep without fear and be greatly respected.
Job,11,20,But those who are evil will go blind and lose their way. Their only escape is death!
Job,13,1,I know and understand every bit of this.
Job,13,2,None of you are cleverer than I am; there's nothing you know that I don't.
Job,13,3,But I prefer to argue my case with God All-Powerful—
Job,13,4,"you are merely useless doctors, who treat me with lies."
Job,13,5,The wisest thing you can do is to keep quiet
Job,13,6,and listen to my argument.
Job,13,7,Are you telling lies for God
Job,13,8,and not telling the whole truth when you argue his case?
Job,13,9,"If he took you to court, could you fool him, just as you fool others?"
Job,13,10,"If you were secretly unfair, he would correct you,"
Job,13,11,and his glorious splendour would make you terrified.
Job,13,12,Your wisdom and arguments are as delicate as dust.
Job,13,13,"Be quiet while I speak, then say what you will."
Job,13,14,I will be responsible for what happens to me.
Job,13,15,"God may kill me, but still I will trust him and offer my defence."
Job,13,16,"This may be what saves me, because no guilty person would come to his court."
Job,13,17,Listen carefully to my words!
Job,13,18,"I have prepared my case well, and I am certain to win."
Job,13,19,"If you can prove me guilty, I will give up and die."
Job,13,20,"I ask only two things of you, my God, and I will no longer hide from you—"
Job,13,21,stop punishing and terrifying me!
Job,13,22,"Then speak, and I will reply; or else let me speak, and you reply."
Job,13,23,"Please point out my sins, so I will know them."
Job,13,24,Why have you turned your back and count me your enemy?
Job,13,25,Do you really enjoy frightening a fallen leaf?
Job,13,26,Why do you accuse me of horrible crimes and make me pay for sins I did in my youth?
Job,13,27,You have tied my feet down and keep me surrounded;
Job,13,28,I am rotting away like cloth eaten by worms.
Job,14,1,Life is short and sorrowful for every living soul.
Job,14,2,We are flowers that fade and shadows that vanish.
Job,14,3,"And so, I ask you, God, why pick on me?"
Job,14,4,There's no way a human can be completely pure.
Job,14,5,Our time on earth is brief; the number of our days is already decided by you.
Job,14,6,Why don't you leave us alone and let us find some happiness while we toil and labour?
Job,14,7,"When a tree is chopped down, there is always the hope that it will sprout again."
Job,14,8,"Its roots and stump may rot,"
Job,14,9,"but at the touch of water, fresh twigs shoot up."
Job,14,10,"Humans are different— we die, and that's the end."
Job,14,11,We are like streams and lakes after the water has gone;
Job,14,12,"we fall into the sleep of death, never to rise again, until the sky disappears."
Job,14,13,"Please hide me, God, deep in the ground— and when you are angry no more, remember to rescue me."
Job,14,14,Will we humans live again? I would gladly suffer and wait for my time.
Job,14,15,"My Creator, you would want me; you would call out, and I would answer."
Job,14,16,"You would take care of me, but not count my sins—"
Job,14,17,"you would put them in a bag, tie it tight, and toss them away."
Job,14,18,"But in the real world, mountains tumble, and rocks crumble;"
Job,14,19,streams wear away stones and wash away soil. And you destroy our hopes!
Job,14,20,"You change the way we look, then send us away, wiped out for ever."
Job,14,21,We never live to know if our children are praised or disgraced.
Job,14,22,"We feel no pain but our own, and when we mourn, it's only for ourselves."
Job,15,1,Eliphaz from Teman said:
Job,16,1,Job said:
Job,16,2,"I have often heard this, and it offers no comfort."
Job,16,3,So why don't you keep quiet? What's bothering you?
Job,16,4,"If I were in your place, it would be easy to criticize or to give advice."
Job,16,5,But I would offer hope and comfort instead.
Job,16,6,"If I speak, or if I don't, I suffer all the same. My torment continues."
Job,16,7,God has worn me down and destroyed my family;
Job,16,8,my shrivelled up skin proves that I am his prisoner.
Job,16,9,"God is my hateful enemy, glaring at me and attacking with his sharp teeth."
Job,16,10,Everyone is against me; they sneer and slap my face.
Job,16,11,And God is the one who handed me over to this merciless mob.
Job,16,12,"Everything was going well, until God grabbed my neck and shook me to pieces. God set me up as the target"
Job,16,13,"for his arrows, and without showing mercy, he slashed my stomach open, spilling out my insides."
Job,16,14,"God never stops attacking,"
Job,16,15,"and so, in my sorrow I dress in sackcloth and sit in the dust."
Job,16,16,"My face is red with tears, and dark shadows circle my eyes,"
Job,16,17,"though I am not violent, and my prayers are sincere."
Job,16,18,"If I should die, I beg the earth not to cover my cry for justice."
Job,16,19,"Even now, God in heaven is both my witness and my protector."
Job,16,20,"My friends have rejected me, but God is the one I beg"
Job,16,21,"to show that I am right, just as a friend should."
Job,16,22,"Because in only a few years, I will be dead and gone."
Job,17,1,"My hopes have died, my time is up, and the grave is ready."
Job,17,2,"All I can see are angry crowds, making fun of me."
Job,17,3,"If you, LORD , don't help, who will pay the price for my release?"
Job,17,4,"My friends won't really listen, all because of you, and so you must be the one to prove them wrong."
Job,17,5,"They have condemned me, just to benefit themselves; now blind their children."
Job,17,6,"You, God, are the reason I am insulted and spat on."
Job,17,7,I am almost blind with grief; my body is a mere shadow.
Job,17,8,"People who are truly good would feel so alarmed, that they would become angry with my worthless friends."
Job,17,9,"They would do the right thing and because they did, they would grow stronger."
Job,17,10,But none of my friends show any sense.
Job,17,11,My life is drawing to an end; hope has disappeared.
Job,17,12,But all my friends can do is offer empty hopes.
Job,17,13,I could tell the world below to prepare me a bed.
Job,17,14,"Then I could greet the grave as my father and say to the worms, “Hello, mother and sisters!”"
Job,17,15,But what kind of hope is that?
Job,17,16,Will it keep me company in the world of the dead?
Job,18,1,Bildad from Shuah said:
Job,18,2,How long will you talk? Be sensible! Let us speak.
Job,18,3,Or do you think that we are dumb animals?
Job,18,4,You cut yourself in anger. Will that shake the earth or even move the rocks?
Job,19,1,Job said:
Job,19,2,How long will you torture me with your words?
Job,19,3,Isn't ten times enough for you to accuse me? Aren't you ashamed?
Job,19,4,"Even if I have sinned, you haven't been harmed."
Job,19,5,"You boast of your goodness, claiming I am suffering because I am guilty."
Job,19,6,But God is the one at fault for finding fault with me.
Job,19,7,"Though I pray to be rescued from this torment, no whisper of justice answers me."
Job,19,8,God has me trapped with a wall of darkness
Job,19,9,and stripped of respect.
Job,19,10,"God rips me apart, uproots my hopes,"
Job,19,11,"and attacks with fierce anger, as though I were his enemy."
Job,19,12,"His entire army advances, then surrounds my tent."
Job,20,1,Zophar from Naamah said:
Job,20,2,Your words are disturbing; now I must speak.
Job,20,3,"You have accused and insulted me, and reason requires a reply."
Job,20,4,"Since the time of creation, everyone has known"
Job,20,5,that sinful people are happy for only a while.
Job,20,6,"Though their pride and power may reach to the sky,"
Job,20,7,"they will disappear like dust, and those who knew them will wonder what happened."
Job,20,8,They will be forgotten like a dream
Job,20,9,and vanish from the sight of family and friends.
Job,20,10,Their children will have to repay what the parents took from the poor.
Job,20,11,"Indeed, the wicked will die and go to their graves in the prime of life."
Job,20,12,Sinners love the taste of sin; they relish every bite
Job,20,13,and swallow it slowly.
Job,20,14,But their food will turn sour and poison their stomachs.
Job,20,15,Then God will make them lose the wealth they gobbled up.
Job,20,16,They will die from the fangs of poisonous snakes
Job,20,17,and never enjoy rivers flowing with milk and honey.
Job,20,18,"Their hard work will result in nothing gained,"
Job,20,19,because they cheated the poor and took their homes.
Job,20,20,Greedy people want everything and are never satisfied.
Job,20,21,"But when nothing remains for them to grab, they will be nothing."
Job,20,22,"Once they have everything, distress and despair will strike them down,"
Job,20,23,and God will make them swallow his blazing anger.
Job,20,24,"While running from iron spears, they will be killed by arrows of bronze,"
Job,20,25,"whose shining tips go straight through their bodies. They will be trapped by terror,"
Job,20,26,and what they treasure most will be lost in the dark. God will send flames to destroy them in their tents with all their property.
Job,20,27,"The heavens and the earth will testify against them,"
Job,20,28,and all their possessions will be dragged off when God becomes angry.
Job,20,29,This is what God has decided for those who are evil.
Job,21,1,Job said:
Job,21,2,"If you want to offer comfort, then listen to me."
Job,21,3,"And when I have finished, you can start your insults all over again."
Job,21,4,My complaint is against God; that's why I am impatient.
Job,21,5,"Just looking at me is enough to make you sick,"
Job,21,6,and the very thought of myself fills me with disgust.
Job,21,7,Why do evil people live so long and gain such power?
Job,21,8,Why are they allowed to see their children grow up?
Job,21,9,"They have no worries at home, and God never punishes them."
Job,21,10,Their cattle have lots of calves without ever losing one;
Job,21,11,their children play and dance safely by themselves.
Job,21,12,"These people sing and celebrate to the sound of tambourines, small harps, and flutes,"
Job,21,13,"and they are successful, without a worry, until the day they die."
Job,21,14,"Those who are evil say to God All-Powerful, “Leave us alone! Don't bother us with your teachings."
Job,21,15,What do we gain from praying and worshipping you?
Job,21,16,"We succeeded all on our own.” And so, I keep away from them and their evil schemes."
Job,21,17,How often does God become angry and send disaster and darkness to punish sinners?
Job,21,18,How often does he strike them like a storm that scatters straw?
Job,21,19,"You say, “God will punish those sinners' children in place of those sinners.” But I say, “Let him punish those sinners themselves until they really feel it."
Job,21,20,Let God All-Powerful force them to drink their own destruction from the cup of his anger.
Job,21,21,"Because after they are dead, they won't care what happens to their children.”"
Job,21,22,Who can tell God what to do? He judges powerful rulers.
Job,22,1,Eliphaz from Teman said:
Job,22,2,"What use are we humans to God, even the wisest of us?"
Job,22,3,"If you were completely sinless, that would still mean nothing to God All-Powerful."
Job,22,4,Is he correcting you for worshipping him?
Job,22,5,No! It's because of your terrible sins.
Job,22,6,"To guarantee payment of a debt, you have taken clothes from the poor."
Job,22,7,"And you refused bread and water to the hungry and thirsty,"
Job,22,8,"although you were rich, respected, and powerful."
Job,22,9,You have turned away widows and have broken the arms of orphans.
Job,22,10,"That's why you were suddenly trapped by terror,"
Job,22,11,"blinded by darkness, and drowned in a flood."
Job,22,12,"God lives in the heavens above the highest stars, where he sees everything."
Job,22,13,Do you think the deep darkness hides you from God?
Job,22,14,"Do thick clouds cover his eyes, as he walks around heaven's dome high above the earth?"
Job,22,15,"Give up those ancient ideas believed by sinners,"
Job,22,16,who were swept away without warning.
Job,22,17,"They rejected God All-Powerful, feeling he was helpless,"
Job,22,18,although he had been kind to their families. The beliefs of these sinners are truly disgusting.
Job,22,19,"When God's people see the godless swept away, they celebrate,"
Job,22,20,"saying, “Our enemies are gone, and fire has destroyed their possessions.”"
Job,22,21,Surrender to God All-Powerful! You will find peace and prosperity.
Job,22,22,Listen to his teachings and take them to heart.
Job,22,23,"If you return to God and turn from sin, all will go well for you."
Job,22,24,"So get rid of your finest gold, as though it were sand."
Job,22,25,"Let God All-Powerful be your silver and gold,"
Job,22,26,and you will find happiness by worshipping him.
Job,22,27,"God will answer your prayers, and you will keep the promises you made to him."
Job,22,28,"He will do whatever you ask, and life will be bright."
Job,22,29,"When others are disgraced, God will clear their names in answer to your prayers."
Job,22,30,"Even those who are guilty will be forgiven, because you obey God."
Job,23,1,Job said:
Job,23,2,"Today I complain bitterly, because God has been cruel and made me suffer."
Job,23,3,"If I knew where to find God, I would go there"
Job,23,4,and argue my case.
Job,23,5,Then I would discover what he wanted to say.
Job,23,6,Would he overwhelm me with his greatness? No! He would listen
Job,23,7,"because I am innocent, and he would say, “I now set you free!”"
Job,23,8,"I cannot find God anywhere— in front of or behind me,"
Job,23,9,"to my left or my right. God is always at work, though I never see him."
Job,23,10,"But he knows what I am doing, and when he tests me, I will be pure as gold."
Job,24,1,Why doesn't God set a time for court? Why don't his people know where he can be found?
Job,24,2,Sinners remove boundary markers and take care of sheep they have stolen.
Job,24,3,They cheat orphans and widows by taking their donkeys and oxen.
Job,24,4,The poor are trampled and forced to hide
Job,24,5,"in the desert, where they and their children must live like wild donkeys and search for food."
Job,24,6,"If they want grain or grapes, they must go to the property of these sinners."
Job,24,7,"They sleep naked in the cold, because they have no cover,"
Job,24,8,and during a storm their only shelters are caves among the rocky cliffs.
Job,24,9,Children whose fathers have died are taken from their mothers as payment for a debt.
Job,24,10,"Then they are forced to work naked in the grain fields because they have no clothes, and they go hungry."
Job,24,11,They crush olives to make oil and grapes to make wine— but still they go thirsty.
Job,24,12,"And along the city streets, the wounded and dying cry out, yet God does nothing."
Job,24,13,Some rebel and refuse to follow the light.
Job,24,14,"Soon after sunset they murder the poor and the needy, and at night they steal."
Job,24,15,"Others wait for the dark, thinking they won't be seen if they sleep with the wife or husband of someone else."
Job,24,16,"Robbers hide during the day, then break in after dark because they reject the light."
Job,24,17,"They prefer night to day, since the terrors of the night are their friends."
Job,24,18,"Those sinners are filthy foam on the surface of the water. And so, their fields and vineyards will fall under a curse and won't produce."
Job,24,19,"Just as the heat of summer swallows the snow, the world of the dead swallows those who sin."
Job,24,20,"Forgotten here on earth, and with their power broken, they taste sweet to worms."
Job,24,21,Sinners take advantage of widows and other helpless women.
Job,24,22,"But God's mighty strength destroys those in power. Even if they seem successful, they are doomed to fail."
Job,24,23,"God may let them feel secure, but they are never out of his sight."
Job,24,24,"Great for a while; gone for ever! Sinners are mowed down like weeds, then they wither and die."
Job,24,25,"If I haven't spoken the truth, then prove me wrong."
Job,25,1,Bildad from Shuah said:
Job,25,2,"God is the one to fear, because God is in control and rules the heavens."
Job,25,3,Who can count his army of stars? Isn't God the source of light?
Job,25,4,How can anyone be innocent in the sight of God?
Job,25,5,"To him, not even the light of the moon and stars can ever be pure."
Job,25,6,"So how can we humans, when we are merely worms?"
Job,26,1,Job said:
Job,26,2,You have really been helpful to someone weak and weary.
Job,26,3,You have given great advice and wonderful wisdom to someone truly in need.
Job,26,4,How can anyone possibly speak with such understanding?
Job,26,5,Remember the terrible trembling of those in the world of the dead below the mighty ocean.
Job,26,6,"Nothing in that land of death and destruction is hidden from God,"
Job,26,7,who hung the northern sky and suspended the earth on empty space.
Job,26,8,"God stores water in clouds, but they don't burst,"
Job,26,9,and he wraps them around the face of the moon.
Job,26,10,"On the surface of the sea, God has drawn a boundary line between light and darkness."
Job,26,11,And columns supporting the sky tremble at his command.
Job,26,12,"By his power and wisdom, God conquered the force of the mighty ocean."
Job,26,13,"The heavens became bright when he breathed, and the escaping sea monster died at the hands of God."
Job,26,14,These things are merely a whisper of God's power at work. How little we would understand if this whisper ever turned into thunder!
Job,27,1,Job said:
Job,27,2,"I am desperate because God All-Powerful refuses to do what is right. As surely as God lives,"
Job,27,3,"and while he gives me breath,"
Job,27,4,I will tell only the truth.
Job,27,5,"Until the day I die, I will refuse to do wrong by saying you are right,"
Job,27,6,because each day my conscience agrees that I am innocent.
Job,27,7,I pray that my enemies will suffer no less than the wicked.
Job,27,8,"Such people are hopeless, and God All-Powerful will cut them down,"
Job,27,9,without listening when they beg for mercy.
Job,27,10,"And that is what God should do, because they don't like him or ever pray."
Job,27,11,Now I will explain in detail what God All-Powerful does.
Job,27,12,All of you have seen these things for yourselves. So you have no excuse.
Job,27,13,Here is how God All-Powerful treats those who are wicked and brutal.
Job,27,14,"They may have many children, but most of them will go hungry or suffer a violent death."
Job,27,15,"Others will die of disease, and their widows won't be able to weep."
Job,27,16,The wicked may collect riches and clothes in abundance as easily as clay.
Job,27,17,But God's people will wear clothes taken from them and divide up their riches.
Job,27,18,No homes built by the wicked will outlast a cocoon or a shack.
Job,27,19,"Those sinners may go to bed rich, but they will wake up poor."
Job,27,20,Terror will strike at night like a flood or a storm.
Job,27,21,Then a scorching wind will sweep them away
Job,27,22,"without showing mercy, as they try to escape."
Job,27,23,"At last, the wind will celebrate because they are gone."
Job,28,1,"Gold and silver are mined, then purified;"
Job,28,2,the same is done with iron and copper.
Job,28,3,Miners carry lanterns deep into the darkness to search for these metals.
Job,28,4,"They dig tunnels in distant, unknown places, where they dangle by ropes."
Job,28,5,"Far beneath the grain fields, fires are built to break loose those rocks"
Job,28,6,that have jewels or gold.
Job,28,7,Miners go to places unseen by the eyes of hawks;
Job,28,8,they walk on soil unknown to the proudest lions.
Job,28,9,With their own hands they remove sharp rocks and uproot mountains.
Job,28,10,They dig through the rocks in search of jewels and precious metals.
Job,28,11,They also uncover the sources of rivers and discover secret places.
Job,28,12,But where is wisdom found?
Job,28,13,No human knows the way.
Job,28,14,Nor can it be discovered in the deepest sea.
Job,29,1,Job said:
Job,29,2,"I long for the past, when God took care of me,"
Job,29,3,and the light from his lamp showed me the way through the dark.
Job,29,4,"I was in the prime of life, God All-Powerful was my closest friend,"
Job,29,5,and all my children were nearby.
Job,29,6,"My herds gave enough milk to bathe my feet, and from my olive harvest flowed rivers of oil."
Job,30,1,"Young people now insult me, although their fathers would have been a disgrace to my sheep dogs."
Job,30,2,And those who insult me are helpless themselves.
Job,30,3,They must claw the desert sand in the dark for something to satisfy their hunger.
Job,30,4,"They gather tasteless shrubs for food and firewood,"
Job,30,5,"and they are driven out of towns, as though they were thieves."
Job,30,6,"Their only homes are ditches or holes between rocks,"
Job,30,7,where they bray like donkeys gathering around shrubs.
Job,30,8,And like senseless donkeys they are chased away.
Job,30,9,Those worthless nobodies make up jokes and songs to disgrace me.
Job,30,10,"They are hateful and keep their distance, even while spitting in my direction."
Job,30,11,"God has destroyed me, and so they don't care what they do."
Job,30,12,"Their attacks never stop, though I am defenceless, and my feet are trapped."
Job,30,13,"Without any help, they prevent my escape, destroying me completely"
Job,30,14,and leaving me crushed.
Job,30,15,Terror has me surrounded; my reputation and my riches have vanished like a cloud.
Job,30,16,I am sick at heart! Pain has taken its toll.
Job,30,17,"Night chews on my bones, causing endless torment,"
Job,30,18,"and God has shrunk my skin, choking me to death."
Job,30,19,I have been thrown in the dirt and now am dirt myself.
Job,30,20,"I beg God for help, but there is no answer; and when I stand up, he simply stares."
Job,30,21,"God has turned brutal,"
Job,30,22,stirring up a storm to toss me about.
Job,30,23,"Soon he will send me home to the world of the dead, where we all must go."
Job,30,24,"No one refuses help to others, when disaster strikes."
Job,30,25,I mourned for the poor and those who suffered.
Job,30,26,"But when I beg for relief and light, all I receive are disaster and darkness."
Job,30,27,My stomach is tied in knots; pain is my daily companion.
Job,30,28,"Suffering has scorched my skin, and in the city council I stand and cry out,"
Job,30,29,making mournful sounds like jackals and owls.
Job,30,30,"My skin is so parched, that it peels right off, and my bones are burning."
Job,30,31,My only songs are sorrow and sadness.
Job,31,1,I promised myself never to stare with desire at a young woman.
Job,31,2,God All-Powerful punishes men who do that.
Job,31,3,"In fact, God sends disaster on all who sin,"
Job,31,4,and he keeps a close watch on everything I do.
Job,31,5,"I am not dishonest or deceitful,"
Job,31,6,and I beg God to prove my innocence.
Job,31,7,"If I have disobeyed him or even wanted to,"
Job,31,8,then others can eat my harvest and uproot my crops.
Job,31,9,"If I have desired someone's wife and chased after her,"
Job,31,10,then let some stranger steal my wife from me.
Job,31,11,"If I took someone's wife, it would be a horrible crime,"
Job,31,12,sending me to destruction and my crops to the flames.
Job,31,13,"When my servants complained against me, I was fair to them."
Job,31,14,"Otherwise, what answer would I give to God when he judges me?"
Job,31,15,"After all, God is the one who gave life to each of us before we were born."
Job,31,16,"I have never cheated widows or others in need,"
Job,31,17,and I have always shared my food with orphans.
Job,31,18,"Since the time I was young, I have cared for orphans and helped widows."
Job,31,19,"I provided clothes for the poor,"
Job,31,20,and I was praised for supplying woollen garments to keep them warm.
Job,31,21,"If I have ever raised my arm to threaten an orphan when the power was mine,"
Job,31,22,I hope that arm will fall from its socket.
Job,31,23,I could not have been abusive; I was terrified at the thought that God might punish me.
Job,31,24,"I have never trusted the power of wealth,"
Job,31,25,or taken pride in owning many possessions.
Job,32,1,"Finally, these three men stopped arguing with Job, because he refused to admit that he was guilty."
Job,32,2,"Elihu from Buz was there, and he had become upset with Job for blaming God instead of himself."
Job,32,3,He was also angry with Job's three friends for not being able to prove that Job was wrong.
Job,32,4,"Elihu was younger than these three, and he let them speak first."
Job,32,5,"But he became irritated when they could not answer Job,"
Job,32,6,"and he said to them: I am much younger than you, so I have shown respect by keeping silent."
Job,32,7,I once believed age was the source of wisdom;
Job,32,8,now I truly realize wisdom comes from God.
Job,32,9,Age is no guarantee of wisdom and understanding.
Job,32,10,That's why I ask you to listen to me.
Job,33,1,"Job, listen to me! Pay close attention."
Job,34,1,Elihu said:
Job,34,2,"You men think you are wise, but just listen to me!"
Job,34,3,"Think about my words, as you would taste food."
Job,34,4,Then we can decide the case and give a just verdict.
Job,34,5,Job claims he is innocent and God is guilty of ill-treating him.
Job,34,6,Job also argues that God considers him a liar and that he is suffering severely in spite of his innocence.
Job,34,7,"But to tell the truth, Job is shameless!"
Job,34,8,"He spends his time with sinners,"
Job,34,9,"because he has said, “It doesn't pay to please God.”"
Job,34,10,"If any of you are clever, you will listen and learn that God All-Powerful does what is right."
Job,34,11,"God always treats everyone the way they deserve,"
Job,34,12,and he is never unfair.
Job,34,13,"From the very beginning, God has been in control of all the world."
Job,34,14,"If God took back the breath that he breathed into us,"
Job,34,15,we humans would die and return to the soil.
Job,34,16,So be wise and listen!
Job,34,17,"The mighty God is the one who brings about justice, and you are condemning him."
Job,34,18,"Indeed, God is the one who condemns unfair rulers."
Job,34,19,"And God created us all; he has no favourites, whether rich or poor."
Job,34,20,"Even powerful rulers die in the darkness of night when they least expect it, just like the rest of us."
Job,34,21,God watches everything we do.
Job,34,22,No evil person can hide in the deepest darkness.
Job,34,23,"And so, God doesn't need to set a time for judgment."
Job,34,24,"Without asking for advice, God removes mighty leaders and puts others in their place."
Job,34,25,"He knows what they are like, and he wipes them out in the middle of the night."
Job,34,26,"And while others look on, he punishes them because they were evil"
Job,34,27,and refused to obey him.
Job,34,28,"The persons they ill-treated had prayed for help, until God answered their prayers."
Job,34,29,"When God does nothing, can any person or nation find fault with him?"
Job,34,30,"But still, he punishes rulers who abuse their people."
Job,34,31,"Job, you should tell God that you are guilty and promise to do better."
Job,34,32,"Then ask him to point out what you did wrong, so you won't do it again."
Job,34,33,"Do you make the rules, or does God? You have to decide— I can't do it for you; now make up your mind."
Job,34,34,"Job, anyone with good sense can easily see"
Job,34,35,that you are speaking nonsense and lack good judgment.
Job,34,36,So I pray for you to suffer as much as possible for talking like a sinner.
Job,34,37,"You have rebelled against God, time after time, and have even insulted us."
Job,35,1,Elihu said:
Job,35,2,"Job, are you really innocent in the sight of God?"
Job,35,3,Don't you honestly believe it pays to obey him?
Job,35,4,I will give the answers to you and your friends.
Job,36,1,Elihu said:
Job,36,2,Be patient a while longer; I have something else to say in God's defence.
Job,36,3,God always does right— and this knowledge comes straight from God.
Job,36,4,You can rest assured that what I say is true.
Job,36,5,"Although God is mighty, he cares about everyone and makes fair decisions."
Job,36,6,"The wicked are cut down, and those who are wronged receive justice."
Job,36,7,God watches over good people and places them in positions of power and honour for ever.
Job,36,8,"But when people are prisoners of suffering and pain,"
Job,37,1,"I am frightened and tremble all over,"
Job,37,2,"when I hear the roaring voice of God in the thunder,"
Job,37,3,and when I see his lightning flash across the sky.
Job,37,4,"God's majestic voice thunders his commands,"
Job,37,5,creating miracles too marvellous for us to understand.
Job,37,6,Snow and heavy rainstorms
Job,37,7,"make us stop and think about God's power,"
Job,37,8,and they force animals to seek shelter.
Job,37,9,"The storms of winter strike,"
Job,37,10,and the breath of God freezes streams and rivers.
Job,37,11,"Rain clouds filled with lightning appear at God's command,"
Job,37,12,travelling across the sky
Job,37,13,"to release their cargo— sometimes as punishment for sin, sometimes as kindness."
Job,37,14,"Job, consider carefully the many wonders of God."
Job,37,15,Can you explain why lightning flashes at the orders
Job,37,16,of God who knows all things? Or how he hangs the clouds in empty space?
Job,37,17,You almost melt in the heat of fierce desert winds when the sky is like brass.
Job,37,18,"God can spread out the clouds to get relief from the heat, but can you?"
Job,37,19,"Tell us what to say to God! Our minds are in the dark, and we don't know how to argue our case."
Job,37,20,Should I risk my life by telling God that I want to speak?
Job,37,21,No one can stare at the sun after a breeze has blown the clouds from the sky.
Job,37,22,Yet the glorious splendour of God All-Powerful is brighter by far.
Job,37,23,"God cannot be seen— but his power is great, and he is always fair."
Job,37,24,"And so we humans fear God, because he shows no respect for those who are proud and think they know so much."
Job,38,1,"From out of a storm, the LORD said to Job:"
Job,38,2,Why do you talk so much when you know so little?
Job,38,3,Now get ready to face me! Can you answer the questions I ask?
Job,38,4,How did I lay the foundation for the earth? Were you there?
Job,38,5,Doubtless you know who decided its length and width.
Job,38,6,"What supports the foundation? Who placed the cornerstone,"
Job,38,7,"while morning stars sang, and angels rejoiced?"
Job,38,8,"When the ocean was born, I set its boundaries"
Job,38,9,and wrapped it in blankets of thickest fog.
Job,38,10,"Then I built a wall around it, locked the gates,"
Job,38,11,"and said, “Your powerful waves stop here! They can go no further.”"
Job,38,12,Did you ever tell the sun to rise? And did it obey?
Job,38,13,Did it take hold of the earth and shake out the wicked like dust from a rug?
Job,38,14,Early dawn outlines the hills like stitches on clothing or sketches on clay.
Job,38,15,"But its light is too much for those who are evil, and their power is broken."
Job,38,16,"Job, have you ever walked on the ocean floor?"
Job,38,17,Have you seen the gate to the world of the dead?
Job,38,18,"And how large is the earth? Tell me, if you know!"
Job,38,19,"Where is the home of light, and where does darkness live?"
Job,38,20,Can you lead them home?
Job,38,21,"I'm certain you must be able to, since you were already born when I created everything."
Job,38,22,"Have you been to the places where I keep snow and hail,"
Job,38,23,until I use them to punish and conquer nations?
Job,38,24,"From where does lightning leap, or the east wind blow?"
Job,38,25,Who carves out a path for thunderstorms? Who sends torrents of rain
Job,38,26,on empty deserts where no one lives?
Job,38,27,Rain that changes barren land to meadows green with grass.
Job,38,28,Who is the father of the dew and of the rain?
Job,38,29,Who gives birth to the sleet and the frost
Job,38,30,"that fall in winter, when streams and lakes freeze solid as a rock?"
Job,38,31,Can you arrange stars in groups such as Orion and the Pleiades?
Job,38,32,Do you control the stars or set in place the Great Bear and the Little Bear?
Job,38,33,"Do you know the laws that govern the heavens, and can you make them rule the earth?"
Job,38,34,"Can you order the clouds to send a downpour,"
Job,38,35,or will lightning flash at your command?
Job,38,36,Did you teach birds to know that rain or floods are on their way?
Job,38,37,Can you count the clouds or pour out their water
Job,38,38,"on the dry, lumpy soil?"
Job,38,39,"When lions are hungry, do you help them hunt?"
Job,38,40,Do you send an animal into their den?
Job,38,41,"And when starving young ravens cry out to me for food, do you satisfy their hunger?"
Job,39,1,When do mountain goats and deer give birth? Have you been there when their young are born?
Job,41,1,Can you catch a sea monster by using a fish-hook? Can you tie its mouth shut with a rope?
Job,41,2,Can it be led around by a ring in its nose or a hook in its jaw?
Job,41,3,Will it beg for mercy?
Job,41,4,Will it surrender as a slave for life?
Job,41,5,Can it be tied by the leg like a pet bird for little girls?
Job,41,6,Is it ever chopped up and its pieces bargained for in the fish-market?
Job,41,7,Can it be killed with harpoons or spears?
Job,41,8,Wrestle with it just once— that will be the end.
Job,41,9,Merely a glimpse of this monster makes all courage melt.
Job,41,10,"And if it is too fierce for anyone to attack, who would dare oppose me?"
Job,41,11,I am in command of the world and in debt to no one.
Job,41,12,"What powerful legs, what a stout body this monster possesses!"
Job,41,13,Who could strip off its armour or bring it under control with a harness?
Job,41,14,"Who would try to open its jaws, full of fearsome teeth?"
Job,42,1,Job said:
Job,42,2,"No one can oppose you, because you have the power to do what you want."
Job,42,3,You asked why I talk so much when I know so little. I have talked about things that are far beyond my understanding.
Job,42,4,You told me to listen and answer your questions.
Job,42,5,I heard about you from others; now I have seen you with my own eyes.
Job,42,6,That's why I hate myself and sit here in dust and ashes to show my sorrow.
Job,42,7,"The LORD said to Eliphaz: What my servant Job has said about me is true, but I am angry with you and your two friends for not telling the truth."
Job,42,8,"So I want you to go over to Job and offer seven bulls and seven goats on an altar as a sacrifice to please me. After this, Job will pray, and I will agree not to punish you for your foolishness."
Job,42,9,"Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar obeyed the LORD , and he answered Job's prayer."
Job,42,10,"After Job had prayed for his three friends, the LORD made Job twice as rich as he had been before."
Job,42,11,"Then Job gave a feast for his brothers and sisters and for his old friends. They expressed their sorrow for the suffering the LORD had brought on him, and they each gave Job some silver and a gold ring."
Job,42,12,"The LORD now blessed Job more than ever; he gave him fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand pair of oxen, and a thousand donkeys."
Job,42,13,"In addition to seven sons, Job had three daughters,"
Job,42,14,"whose names were Jemimah, Keziah, and Keren Happuch."
Job,42,15,"They were the most beautiful women in that part of the world, and Job gave them shares of his property, along with their brothers."
Job,42,16,Job lived for another one hundred and forty years—long enough to see his great-grandchildren have children of their own—
Job,42,17,"and when he finally died, he was very old."
