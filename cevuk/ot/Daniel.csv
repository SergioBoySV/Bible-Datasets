Daniel,1,1,"In the third year that Jehoiakim was king of Judah, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia attacked Jerusalem."
Daniel,1,2,"The Lord let Nebuchadnezzar capture Jehoiakim and take away some of the things used in God's temple. And when the king returned to Babylonia, he put these things in the temple of his own god."
Daniel,1,3,"One day the king ordered Ashpenaz, his highest palace official, to choose some young men from the royal family of Judah and from other leading Jewish families."
Daniel,1,4,"The king said, “They must be healthy, handsome, clever, wise, educated, and fit to serve in the royal palace. Teach them how to speak and write our language"
Daniel,1,5,"and give them the same food and wine that I am served. Train them for three years, and then they can become court officials.”"
Daniel,1,6,"Four of the young Jews chosen were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, all from the tribe of Judah."
Daniel,1,7,"But the king's chief official gave them Babylonian names: Daniel became Belteshazzar, Hananiah became Shadrach, Mishael became Meshach, and Azariah became Abednego."
Daniel,1,8,Daniel made up his mind to eat and drink only what God had approved for his people to eat. And he asked the king's chief official for permission not to eat the food and wine served in the royal palace.
Daniel,1,9,God had made the official friendly and kind to Daniel.
Daniel,1,10,"But the man still told him, “The king has decided what you must eat and drink. And I am afraid he will kill me, if you eat something else and end up looking worse than the other young men.”"
Daniel,1,11,"The king's official had put a guard in charge of Daniel and his three friends. So Daniel said to the guard,"
Daniel,1,12,"“For the next ten days, let us have only vegetables and water at mealtimes."
Daniel,1,13,"When the ten days are up, compare how we look with the other young men, and decide what to do with us.”"
Daniel,1,14,The guard agreed to do what Daniel had asked.
Daniel,1,15,"Ten days later, Daniel and his friends looked healthier and better than the young men who had been served food from the royal palace."
Daniel,1,16,"After this, the guard let them eat vegetables instead of the rich food and wine."
Daniel,1,17,God made the four young men clever and wise. They read a lot of books and became well educated. Daniel could also tell the meaning of dreams and visions.
Daniel,1,18,"At the end of the three year period set by King Nebuchadnezzar, his chief palace official brought all the young men to him."
Daniel,1,19,"The king interviewed them and discovered that none of the others were as outstanding as Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. So they were given positions in the royal court."
Daniel,1,20,"From then on, whenever the king asked for advice, he found their wisdom was ten times better than that of any of his other advisers and magicians."
Daniel,1,21,Daniel served there until the first year of King Cyrus.
Daniel,2,1,"During the second year that Nebuchadnezzar was king, he had such horrible nightmares that he could not sleep."
Daniel,2,2,"So he called in his counsellors, advisers, magicians, and wise men,"
Daniel,2,3,"and said, “I am disturbed by a dream that I don't understand, and I want you to explain it.”"
Daniel,2,4,"They answered in Aramaic, “Your Majesty, we hope you live for ever! We are your servants. Please tell us your dream, and we will explain what it means.”"
Daniel,2,5,"But the king replied, “No! I have made up my mind. If you don't tell me both the dream and its meaning, you will be chopped to pieces and your houses will be torn down."
Daniel,2,6,"However, if you do tell me both the dream and its meaning, you will be greatly rewarded and highly honoured. Now tell me the dream and explain what it means.”"
Daniel,2,7,"“Your Majesty,” they said, “if you will only tell us your dream, we will interpret it for you.”"
Daniel,2,8,"The king replied, “You're just stalling for time,"
Daniel,2,9,"because you know what's going to happen if you don't come up with the answer. You've decided to make up a pack of lies, hoping I might change my mind. Now tell me the dream, and that will prove that you can interpret it.”"
Daniel,2,10,"His advisers explained, “Your Majesty, you are demanding the impossible! No king, not even the most famous and powerful, has ever ordered his advisers, magicians, or wise men to do such a thing."
Daniel,2,11,"It can't be done, except by the gods, and they don't live here on earth.”"
Daniel,3,1,"King Nebuchadnezzar ordered a gold statue to be built twenty-seven metres high and nearly three metres wide. He had it set up in Dura Valley near the city of Babylon,"
Daniel,3,2,"and he commanded his governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, and his other officials to come from everywhere in his kingdom to the dedication of the statue."
Daniel,3,3,So all of them came and stood in front of it.
Daniel,3,4,"Then an official stood up and announced: People of every nation and race, now listen to the king's command!"
Daniel,3,5,"Trumpets, flutes, harps, and all other kinds of musical instruments will soon start playing. When you hear the music, you must bow down and worship the statue that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up."
Daniel,3,6,Anyone who refuses will at once be thrown into a flaming furnace.
Daniel,3,7,"As soon as the people heard the music, they bowed down and worshipped the gold statue that the king had set up."
Daniel,3,8,Some Babylonians used this as a chance to accuse the Jews to King Nebuchadnezzar.
Daniel,3,9,"They said, “Your Majesty, we hope you live for ever!"
Daniel,3,10,You commanded everyone to bow down and worship the gold statue when the music played.
Daniel,3,11,And you said that anyone who did not bow down and worship it would be thrown into a flaming furnace.
Daniel,3,12,"Sir, you appointed three men to high positions in Babylon Province, but they have disobeyed you. Those Jews, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, refuse to worship your gods and the statue you have set up.”"
Daniel,3,13,"King Nebuchadnezzar was furious. So he sent for the three young men and said,"
Daniel,3,14,“I hear that you refuse to worship my gods and the gold statue I have set up.
Daniel,3,15,"Now I am going to give you one more chance. If you bow down and worship the statue when you hear the music, everything will be all right. But if you don't, you will at once be thrown into a flaming furnace. No god can save you from me.”"
Daniel,3,16,"The three men replied, “Your Majesty, we don't need to defend ourselves."
Daniel,3,17,The God we worship can save us from you and your flaming furnace.
Daniel,3,18,"But even if he doesn't, we still won't worship your gods and the gold statue you have set up.”"
Daniel,3,19,Nebuchadnezzar's face twisted with anger at the three men. And he ordered the furnace to be heated seven times hotter than usual.
Daniel,3,20,"Next, he commanded some of his strongest soldiers to tie up the men and throw them into the flaming furnace."
Daniel,4,1,King Nebuchadnezzar sent the following letter to the people of all nations and races on the earth: Greetings to all of you!
Daniel,4,2,I am glad to tell about the wonderful miracles God Most High has done for me.
Daniel,4,3,"His miracles are mighty and marvellous. He will rule for ever, and his kingdom will never end."
Daniel,4,4,"I was enjoying a time of peace and prosperity,"
Daniel,4,5,when suddenly I had some horrifying dreams and visions.
Daniel,4,6,"Then I commanded every wise man in Babylonia to appear in my court, so they could explain the meaning of my dream."
Daniel,4,7,"After they arrived, I told them my dream, but they were not able to say what it meant."
Daniel,4,8,"Finally, a young man named Daniel came in, and I told him the dream. The holy gods had given him special powers, and I had renamed him Belteshazzar after my own god."
Daniel,4,9,"I said, “Belteshazzar, not only are you the wisest of all advisers and counsellors, but the holy gods have given you special powers to solve the most difficult mysteries. So listen to what I dreamed and tell me what it means:"
Daniel,4,10,In my sleep I saw a very tall tree in the centre of the world.
Daniel,4,11,"It grew stronger and higher, until it reached to heaven and could be seen from anywhere on earth."
Daniel,4,12,"It was covered with leaves and heavy with fruit— enough for all nations. Wild animals enjoyed its shade, birds nested in its branches, and all creatures on earth lived on its fruit."
Daniel,4,13,"“While I was in bed, having this vision, a holy angel came down from heaven"
Daniel,4,14,and shouted: ‘Chop down the tree and cut off its branches; strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Make the animals leave its shade and send the birds flying from its branches.
Daniel,4,15,"But leave its stump and roots in the ground, surrounded by grass and held by chains of iron and bronze. ‘Make sure that this ruler lives like the animals out in the open fields, unprotected from the dew."
Daniel,4,16,Give him the mind of a wild animal for seven long years.
Daniel,4,17,This punishment is given at the command of the holy angels. It will show to all who live that God Most High controls all kingdoms and chooses for their rulers persons of humble birth.’
Daniel,4,18,"“Daniel, that was the dream that none of the wise men in my kingdom were able to understand. But I am sure that you will understand what it means, because the holy gods have given you some special powers.”"
Daniel,4,19,"For a while, Daniel was terribly confused and worried by what he was thinking. But I said, “Don't be bothered either by the dream or by what it means.” Daniel replied: Your Majesty, I wish the dream had been against your enemies."
Daniel,4,20,You saw a tree that grew so big and strong that it reached up to heaven and could be seen from anywhere on earth.
Daniel,4,21,"Its leaves were beautiful, and it produced enough fruit for all living creatures; animals lived in its shade, and birds nested in its branches."
Daniel,4,22,"Your Majesty, that tree is you. Your glorious reputation has reached heaven, and your kingdom covers the earth."
Daniel,4,23,"Then you saw a holy angel come down from heaven and say, “Chop down the tree and destroy it! But leave its stump and roots in the ground, fastened there by a chain of iron and bronze. Let it stay for seven years out in the field with the wild animals, unprotected from the dew.”"
Daniel,4,24,"Your Majesty, God Most High has sent you this message, and it means"
Daniel,4,25,"that you will be forced to live with the wild animals, far away from humans. You will eat grass like a wild animal and live outdoors for seven years, until you learn that God Most High controls all earthly kingdoms and chooses their rulers."
Daniel,4,26,"But he gave orders not to disturb the stump and roots. This is to show that you will be king once again, after you learn that the God who rules from heaven is in control."
Daniel,4,27,"Your Majesty, please be willing to do what I say. Turn from your sins and start living right; have mercy on those who are ill-treated. Then all will go well with you for a long time."
Daniel,5,1,"One evening, King Belshazzar gave a great banquet for a thousand of his highest officials, and he drank wine with them."
Daniel,5,2,"He got drunk and ordered his servants to bring in the gold and silver cups his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem. Belshazzar wanted the cups, so that he and all his wives and officials could drink from them."
Daniel,6,1,Darius divided his kingdom into a hundred and twenty states and placed a governor in charge of each one.
Daniel,6,2,"In order to make sure that his government was run properly, Darius put three other officials in charge of the governors. One of these officials was Daniel."
Daniel,6,3,And he did his work so much better than the other governors and officials that the king decided to let him govern the whole kingdom.
Daniel,6,4,"The other men tried to find something wrong with the way Daniel did his work for the king. But they could not accuse him of anything wrong, because he was honest and faithful and did everything he was supposed to do."
Daniel,6,5,"Finally, they said to one another, “We will never be able to bring any charge against Daniel, unless it has to do with his religion.”"
Daniel,6,6,"They all went to the king and said: “Your Majesty, we hope you live for ever!"
Daniel,6,7,"All of your officials, leaders, advisers, and governors agree that you should make a law forbidding anyone to pray to any god or human except you for the next thirty days. Everyone who disobeys this law must be thrown into a pit of lions."
Daniel,6,8,"Order this to be written and then sign it, so it cannot be changed, just as no written law of the Medes and Persians can be changed.”"
Daniel,6,9,So King Darius made the law and had it written down.
Daniel,6,10,"Daniel heard about the law, but when he returned home, he went upstairs and prayed in front of the window that faced Jerusalem. In the same way that he had always done, he knelt down in prayer three times a day, giving thanks to God."
Daniel,6,11,The men who had spoken to the king watched Daniel and saw him praying to his God for help.
Daniel,6,12,"They went back to the king and said, “Didn't you make a law that forbids anyone to pray to any god or human except you for the next thirty days? And doesn't the law say that everyone who disobeys it will be thrown into a pit of lions?” “Yes, that's the law I made,” the king agreed. “And just like all written laws of the Medes and Persians, it cannot be changed.”"
Daniel,6,13,"The men then told the king, “That Jew named Daniel, who was brought here as a captive, refuses to obey you or the law that you ordered to be written. And he still prays to his god three times a day.”"
Daniel,6,14,"The king was really upset to hear about this, and for the rest of the day he tried to think how he could save Daniel."
Daniel,6,15,"At sunset the men returned and said, “Your Majesty, remember that no written law of the Medes and Persians can be changed, not even by the king.”"
Daniel,6,16,"So Darius ordered Daniel to be brought out and thrown into a pit of lions. But he said to Daniel, “You have been faithful to your God, and I pray that he will rescue you.”"
Daniel,6,17,"A stone was rolled over the pit, and it was sealed. Then Darius and his officials stamped the seal to show that no one should let Daniel out."
Daniel,6,18,"All night long the king could not sleep. He did not eat anything, and he would not let anyone come in to entertain him."
Daniel,6,19,At daybreak the king got up and ran to the pit.
Daniel,6,20,"He was anxious and shouted, “Daniel, you were faithful and served your God. Was he able to save you from the lions?”"
Daniel,6,21,"Daniel answered, “Your Majesty, I hope you live for ever!"
Daniel,6,22,"My God knew that I was innocent, and he sent an angel to keep the lions from eating me. Your Majesty, I have never done anything to hurt you.”"
Daniel,6,23,"The king was relieved to hear Daniel's voice, and he gave orders for him to be taken out of the pit. Daniel's faith in his God had kept him from being harmed."
Daniel,6,24,"And the king ordered the men who had brought charges against Daniel to be thrown into the pit, together with their wives and children. But before they even reached the bottom, the lions ripped them to pieces."
Daniel,6,25,King Darius then sent this message to all people of every nation and race in the world: “Greetings to all of you!
Daniel,6,26,"I command everyone in my kingdom to worship and honour the God of Daniel. He is the living God, the one who lives for ever. His power and his kingdom will never end."
Daniel,6,27,He rescues people and sets them free by working great miracles. Daniel's God has rescued him from the power of the lions.”
Daniel,6,28,"All went well for Daniel while Darius was king, and even when Cyrus the Persian ruled."
Daniel,8,1,"Daniel wrote: In the third year of King Belshazzar of Babylonia, I had a second vision"
Daniel,8,2,"in which I was in Susa, the chief city of Babylonia's Elam Province. I was beside the River Ulai,"
Daniel,8,3,"when I looked up and saw a ram standing there with two horns on its head—both of them were long, but the second one was longer than the first."
Daniel,8,4,"The ram went charging towards the west, the north, and the south. No other animals were strong enough to oppose him, and nothing could save them from his power. So he did as he pleased and became even more powerful."
Daniel,8,5,"I kept on watching and saw a goat come from the west and charge across the entire earth, without even touching the ground. Between his eyes was a powerful horn,"
Daniel,8,6,and with tremendous anger the goat started towards the ram that I had seen beside the river.
Daniel,8,7,"The goat was so fierce that its attack broke both horns of the ram, leaving him powerless. Then the goat trampled on the ram, and no one could do anything to help."
Daniel,8,8,"After this, the goat became even more powerful. But at the peak of his power, his mighty horn was broken, and four other mighty horns took its place—one pointing to the north and one to the east, one to the south and one to the west."
Daniel,8,9,"A little horn came from one of these, and its power reached to the south, the east, and even to the holy land."
Daniel,8,10,"It became so strong that it attacked the stars in the sky, which were heaven's army. Then it threw some of them down to the earth and trampled on them."
Daniel,10,1,"In the third year of Cyrus the king of Persia, a message came to Daniel from God, and it was explained in a vision. The message was about a horrible war, and it was true."
Daniel,10,2,Daniel wrote: For three weeks I was in sorrow.
Daniel,10,3,"I ate no fine food or meat, I drank no wine, and I put no olive oil on my face or hair."
Daniel,10,4,"Then, on the twenty-fourth day of the first month, I was standing on the banks of the great River Tigris,"
Daniel,10,5,when I looked up and saw someone dressed in linen and wearing a solid gold belt.
Daniel,10,6,"His body was like a precious stone, his face like lightning, his eyes like flaming fires, his arms and legs like polished bronze, and his voice like the roar of a crowd."
Daniel,10,7,"Although the people who were with me did not see the vision, they became so frightened that they scattered and hid."
Daniel,10,8,"Only I saw this great vision. I became weak and pale,"
Daniel,10,9,"and at the sound of his voice, I fell face down in a deep sleep."
Daniel,10,10,He raised me to my hands and knees
Daniel,10,11,"and then said, “Daniel, your God thinks highly of you, and he has sent me. So stand up and pay close attention.” I stood trembling, while the angel said:"
Daniel,10,12,"Daniel, don't be afraid! God has listened to your prayers since the first day you humbly asked for understanding, and he has sent me here."
Daniel,10,13,"But the guardian angel of Persia opposed me for twenty-one days. Then Michael, who is one of the strongest guardian angels, came to rescue me from the kings of Persia."
Daniel,10,14,Now I have come here to give you another vision about what will happen to your people in the future.
Daniel,10,15,"While this angel was speaking to me, I stared at the ground, speechless."
Daniel,10,16,"Then he appeared in human form and touched my lips. I said, “Sir, this vision has brought me great pain and has drained my strength."
Daniel,10,17,"I am merely your servant. How can I possibly speak with someone so powerful, when I am almost too weak to get my breath?”"
Daniel,11,1,You also need to know that I protected and helped Darius the Mede in his first year as king.
Daniel,11,2,"What I am going to tell you is certain to happen. Four kings will rule Persia, one after the other, but the fourth one will become much richer than the others. In fact, his wealth will make him so powerful that he will turn everyone against the kingdom of Greece."
Daniel,11,3,Then a mighty king will come to power and will be able to do whatever he pleases.
Daniel,11,4,"But suddenly his kingdom will be crushed and scattered to the four corners of the earth, where four more kingdoms will rise. But these won't be ruled by his descendants or be as powerful as his kingdom."
Daniel,11,5,The king of the south will grow powerful. Then one of his generals will rebel and take over most of the kingdom.
Daniel,11,6,"Years later the southern kingdom and the northern kingdom will make a treaty, and the daughter of the king of the south will marry the king of the north. But she will lose her power. Then she, her husband, their child, and the servants who came with her will all be killed. After this,"
Daniel,11,7,one of her relatives will become the ruler of the southern kingdom. He will attack the army of the northern kingdom and capture its fortresses.
Daniel,11,8,"Then he will carry their idols to Egypt, together with their precious treasures of silver and gold, but it will be a long time before he attacks the northern kingdom again. Some years later"
Daniel,11,9,"the king of the north will invade the southern kingdom, but he will be forced back to his own country."
Daniel,11,10,"The sons of the king of the north will gather a huge army that will sweep down like a roaring flood, reaching all the way to the fortress of the southern kingdom."
Daniel,11,11,"But this will make the king of the south angry, and he will defeat this large army from the north."
Daniel,11,12,"The king of the south will feel proud because of the many thousands he has killed. But his victories won't last long,"
Daniel,11,13,"because the king of the north will gather a larger and more powerful army than ever before. Then in a few years, he will start invading other countries."
Daniel,11,14,"At this time many of your own people will try to make this vision come true by rebelling against the king of the south, but their rebellion will fail."
Daniel,11,15,"Then the army from the north will surround and capture a fortress in the south, and not even the most experienced troops of the southern kingdom will be able to make them retreat."
Daniel,11,16,"The king who invaded from the north will do as he pleases, and he will even capture and destroy the holy land."
Daniel,11,17,"In fact, he will decide to invade the south with his entire army. Then he will attempt to make peace by giving the king of the south a bride from the northern kingdom, but this won't be successful."
Daniel,11,18,"Afterwards, this proud king of the north will invade and conquer many of the nations along the coast, but a military leader will defeat him and make him lose his pride."
Daniel,11,19,"He will retreat to his fortresses in his own country, but on the way he will be defeated and never again be seen."
Daniel,11,20,"The next king of the north will try to collect taxes for the glory of his kingdom. However, he will come to a sudden end in some mysterious way, instead of in battle or because of someone's anger."
Daniel,11,21,"The successor of this king of the north will be a worthless nobody, who doesn't come from a royal family. He will suddenly appear and gain control of the kingdom by treachery."
Daniel,11,22,Then he will destroy armies and remove God's chosen high priest.
Daniel,11,23,"He will make a treaty, but he will be deceitful and break it, even though he has only a few followers."
Daniel,11,24,"Without warning, he will successfully invade a wealthy province, which is something his ancestors never did. Then he will divide among his followers all of its treasures and property. But none of this will last very long."
Daniel,11,25,"He will gather a large and powerful army, and with great courage he will attack the king of the south. The king of the south will meet him with a much stronger army, but he will lose the battle, because he will be betrayed"
Daniel,11,26,"by members of the royal court. He will be ruined, and most of his army will be slaughtered."
Daniel,11,27,"The two kings will meet around a table and tell evil lies to each other. But their plans will fail, because God has already decided what will happen."
Daniel,11,28,"Then the king of the north will return to his country with great treasures. But on the way, he will attack the religion of God's people and do whatever else he pleases."
Daniel,11,29,"At the time God has decided, the king of the north will invade the southern kingdom again, but this time, things will be different."
Daniel,11,30,"Ships from the west will come to attack him, and he will be discouraged. Then he will start back to his own country and take out his anger on the religion of God's faithful people, while showing kindness to those who are unfaithful."
Daniel,11,31,"He will send troops to pollute the temple and the fortress, and he will stop the daily sacrifices. Then he will set up that “Horrible Thing” that causes destruction."
Daniel,11,32,"The king will use deceit to win followers from those who are unfaithful to God, but those who remain faithful will do everything possible to oppose him."
Daniel,11,33,"Wise leaders will instruct many of the people. But for a while, some of these leaders will either be killed with swords or burnt alive, or else robbed of their possessions and thrown into prison."
Daniel,11,34,"They will receive only a little help in their time of trouble, and many of their followers will be treacherous."
Daniel,11,35,"Some of those who are wise will suffer, so that God will make them pure and acceptable until the end, which will still come at the time he has decided."
Daniel,11,36,"This king will do as he pleases. He will proudly claim to be greater than any god and will insult the only true God. Indeed, he will be successful until God is no longer angry with his people."
Daniel,11,37,"This king will reject the gods his ancestors worshipped and the god preferred by women. In fact, he will put himself above all gods"
Daniel,11,38,"and worship only the so called god of fortresses, who was unknown to his ancestors. And he will honour it with gold, silver, precious stones, and other costly gifts."
Daniel,11,39,"With the help of this foreign god, he will capture the strongest fortresses. Everyone who worships this god will be put in a position of power and rewarded with wealth and land."
Daniel,11,40,"At the time of the end, the king of the south will attack the kingdom of the north. But its king will rush out like a storm with war chariots, cavalry, and many ships. Indeed, his forces will flood one country after another,"
Daniel,11,41,"and when they reach the holy land, tens of thousands will be killed. But the countries of Edom and Moab and the ruler of Ammon will escape."
Daniel,11,42,"The king of the north will invade many countries, including Egypt,"
Daniel,11,43,and he will take its rich treasures of gold and silver. He will also conquer Libya and Ethiopia.
Daniel,11,44,"But he will be alarmed by news from the east and the north, and he will become furious and cause great destruction."
Daniel,11,45,"After this, he will set up camp between the Mediterranean Sea and Mount Zion. Then he will be destroyed, and no one will be able to save him."
Daniel,12,1,"Michael, the chief of the angels, is the protector of your people, and he will come at a time of terrible suffering, the worst in all of history. And your people who have their names written in The Book will be protected."
Daniel,12,2,"Many of those who lie dead in the ground will rise from death. Some of them will be given eternal life, and others will receive nothing but eternal shame and disgrace."
Daniel,12,3,"Everyone who has been wise will shine as bright as the sky above, and everyone who has led others to please God will shine like the stars."
Daniel,12,4,"Daniel, I now command you to keep the message of this book secret until the end of time, even though many people will go everywhere, searching for the knowledge to be found in it."
Daniel,12,5,Daniel wrote: I looked around and saw two other people—one on this side of the river and one on the other side.
Daniel,12,6,"The angel who had spoken to me was dressed in linen and was standing upstream from them. So one of the two beside the river asked him, “How long before these amazing things happen?”"
Daniel,12,7,"The angel then raised both hands towards heaven and said, “In the name of the God who lives for ever, I solemnly promise that it will be a time, two times, and half a time. Everything will be over, when the suffering of God's holy people comes to an end.”"
Daniel,12,8,"I heard what the angel said, but I didn't understand. So I asked, “Sir, how will it all end?” The angel in my vision then replied:"
Daniel,12,9,"Daniel, go about your business, because the meaning of this message will remain secret until the end of time."
Daniel,12,10,"Many people will have their hearts and lives made pure and clean, but those who are evil will keep on being evil and never understand. Only the wise will understand."
Daniel,12,11,"There will be one thousand two hundred and ninety days from the time that the daily sacrifices are stopped, until someone sets up the “Horrible Thing” that causes destruction."
Daniel,12,12,God will bless everyone who patiently waits until one thousand three hundred and thirty-five days have gone by.
Daniel,12,13,"So, Daniel, be faithful until the end! You will rest, and at the end of time, you will rise from death to receive your reward."
