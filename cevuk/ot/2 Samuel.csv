2 Samuel,1,1,"Saul was dead. Meanwhile, David had defeated the Amalekites and returned to Ziklag."
2 Samuel,1,2,"Three days later, a soldier came from Saul's army. His clothes were torn, and earth was on his head. He went to David and knelt down in front of him."
2 Samuel,1,3,"David asked, “Where did you come from?” The man answered, “From Israel's army. I barely escaped with my life.”"
2 Samuel,1,4,"“Who won the battle?” David asked. The man said, “Our army turned and ran, but many were wounded and died. Even King Saul and his son Jonathan are dead.”"
2 Samuel,1,5,"David asked, “How do you know Saul and Jonathan are dead?”"
2 Samuel,1,6,The young man replied: I was on Mount Gilboa and saw King Saul leaning on his spear. The enemy's war chariots and cavalry were closing in on him.
2 Samuel,1,7,"When he turned round and saw me, he called me over. I went and asked what he wanted."
2 Samuel,1,8,"Saul asked me, “Who are you?” “An Amalekite,” I answered."
2 Samuel,1,9,"Then he said, “Kill me! I'm dying, and I'm in terrible pain.”"
2 Samuel,1,10,"So I killed him. I knew he was too badly wounded to live much longer. Then I took his crown and his arm-band, and I brought them to you, Your Majesty. Here they are."
2 Samuel,1,11,"Straight away, David and his soldiers tore their clothes in sorrow."
2 Samuel,1,12,"They cried all day long and would not eat anything. Everyone was sad because Saul, his son Jonathan, and many of the LORD 's people had been killed in the battle."
2 Samuel,1,13,"David asked the young man, “Where is your home?” The man replied, “My father is an Amalekite, but we live in Israel.”"
2 Samuel,2,1,"Later, David asked the LORD , “Should I go back to one of the towns of Judah?” The LORD answered, “Yes.” David asked, “Which town should I go to?” “Go to Hebron,” the LORD replied."
2 Samuel,2,2,"David went to Hebron with his two wives, Ahinoam and Abigail. Ahinoam was from Jezreel, and Abigail was the widow of Nabal from Carmel."
2 Samuel,2,3,David also took his men and their families to live in the villages near Hebron.
2 Samuel,2,4,"The people of Judah met with David at Hebron and poured olive oil on his head to show that he was their new king. Then they told David, “The people from Jabesh in Gilead buried Saul.”"
2 Samuel,2,5,"David sent messengers to tell them: The LORD bless you! You were kind enough to bury Saul your ruler,"
2 Samuel,2,6,and I pray that the LORD will be kind and faithful to you. I will be your friend because of what you have done.
2 Samuel,2,7,"Saul is dead, but the tribe of Judah has made me their king. So be strong and have courage."
2 Samuel,2,8,Abner the son of Ner had been the general of Saul's army. He took Saul's son Ishbosheth across the River Jordan to Mahanaim
2 Samuel,2,9,"and made him king of Israel, including the areas of Gilead, Asher, Jezreel, Ephraim, and Benjamin."
2 Samuel,2,10,"Ishbosheth was forty years old at the time, and he ruled for two years. But the tribe of Judah made David their king,"
2 Samuel,2,11,and he ruled from Hebron for seven and a half years.
2 Samuel,2,12,"One day, Abner and the soldiers of Ishbosheth left Mahanaim and went to Gibeon."
2 Samuel,2,13,"Meanwhile, Joab the son of Zeruiah was leading David's soldiers, and the two groups met at the pool in Gibeon. Abner and his men sat down on one side of the pool, while Joab and his men sat on the other side."
2 Samuel,2,14,"Abner yelled to Joab, “Let's get some of our best soldiers to stand up and fight each other!” Joab agreed,"
2 Samuel,2,15,and twelve of Ishbosheth's men from the tribe of Benjamin got up to fight twelve of David's men.
2 Samuel,2,16,They grabbed each other by the hair and stabbed each other in the side with their daggers. They all died there! That's why the place in Gibeon is called “Field of Daggers”.
2 Samuel,2,17,"Then everyone started fighting. Both sides fought very hard, but David's soldiers defeated Abner and the soldiers of Israel."
2 Samuel,2,18,"Zeruiah's three sons were there: Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Asahel could run as fast as a deer in an open field,"
2 Samuel,2,19,"and he ran straight after Abner, without looking to the right or to the left."
2 Samuel,2,20,"When Abner turned and saw him, he said, “Is that you, Asahel?” Asahel answered, “Yes it is.”"
2 Samuel,2,21,"Abner said, “There are soldiers all around. Stop chasing me and fight one of them! Kill him and take his clothes and weapons for yourself.” But Asahel refused to stop."
2 Samuel,2,22,"Abner said, “If you don't turn back, I'll have to kill you! Then I could never face your brother Joab again.”"
2 Samuel,2,23,"But Asahel would not turn back, so Abner struck him in the stomach with the back end of his spear. The spear went all the way through and came out of his back. Asahel fell down and died. Everyone who saw Asahel lying dead just stopped and stood still."
2 Samuel,2,24,"But Joab and Abishai went after Abner. Finally, about sunset, they came to the hill of Ammah, not far from Giah on the road to Gibeon Desert."
2 Samuel,2,25,"Abner brought the men of Benjamin together in one group on top of a hill, and they got ready to fight."
2 Samuel,2,26,"Abner shouted to Joab, “Aren't we ever going to stop killing each other? Don't you know that the longer we keep on doing this, the worse it's going to be when it's all over? When are you going to order your men to stop chasing their own relatives?”"
2 Samuel,2,27,"Joab shouted back, “I swear by the living God, if you hadn't spoken, my men would have chased their relatives all night!”"
2 Samuel,2,28,"Joab took his trumpet and blew the signal for his soldiers to stop chasing the soldiers of Israel. Straight away, the fighting stopped."
2 Samuel,2,29,Abner and his troops marched through the Jordan valley all that night. Then they crossed the river and marched all morning until they arrived back at Mahanaim.
2 Samuel,2,30,"As soon as Joab stopped chasing Abner, he got David's troops together and counted them. There were nineteen missing besides Asahel."
2 Samuel,2,31,But David's soldiers had killed 360 of Abner's men from the tribe of Benjamin.
2 Samuel,2,32,Joab and his troops carried Asahel's body to Bethlehem and buried him in the family burial place. Then they marched all night and reached Hebron before sunrise.
2 Samuel,3,1,"This battle was the beginning of a long war between the followers of Saul and the followers of David. Saul's power grew weaker, but David's grew stronger."
2 Samuel,4,1,Ishbosheth felt like giving up after he heard that Abner had died in Hebron. Everyone in Israel was terrified.
2 Samuel,4,2,"Ishbosheth had put the two brothers Baanah and Rechab in charge of the soldiers who raided enemy villages. Rimmon was their father, and they were from the town of Beeroth, which belonged to the tribe of Benjamin."
2 Samuel,4,3,"The people who used to live in Beeroth had run away to Gittaim, and they still live there."
2 Samuel,4,4,"Saul's son Jonathan had a son named Mephibosheth, who had not been able to walk since he was five years old. It happened when someone from Jezreel told his nurse that Saul and Jonathan had died. She hurried off with the boy in her arms, but he fell and injured his legs."
2 Samuel,4,5,"One day about midday, Rechab and Baanah went to Ishbosheth's house. It was a hot day, and he was resting"
2 Samuel,5,1,"Israel's leaders met with David at Hebron and said, “We are your relatives."
2 Samuel,5,2,"Even when Saul was king, you led our nation in battle. And the LORD promised that some day you would rule Israel and take care of us like a shepherd.”"
2 Samuel,5,3,"During the meeting, David made an agreement with the leaders and asked the LORD to be their witness. Then the leaders poured olive oil on David's head to show that he was now the king of Israel."
2 Samuel,5,4,"David was thirty years old when he became king, and he ruled for forty years."
2 Samuel,5,5,"He lived in Hebron for the first seven and a half years and ruled only Judah. Then he moved to Jerusalem, where he ruled both Israel and Judah for thirty-three years."
2 Samuel,5,6,"The Jebusites lived in Jerusalem, and David led his army there to attack them. The Jebusites did not think he could get in, so they told him, “You can't get in here! We could drive you away, even if we couldn't see or walk!”"
2 Samuel,6,1,David brought together thirty thousand of Israel's best soldiers and
2 Samuel,6,2,"led them to Baalah in Judah, which was also called Kiriath-Jearim. They were going there to get the sacred chest and bring it back to Jerusalem. The throne of the LORD All-Powerful is above the winged creatures on top of this chest, and he is worshipped there."
2 Samuel,6,3,"They put the sacred chest on a new ox cart and started bringing it down the hill from Abinadab's house. Abinadab's sons Uzzah and Ahio were guiding the ox cart,"
2 Samuel,6,4,with Ahio walking in front of it.
2 Samuel,6,5,"Some of the people of Israel were playing music on small harps and other stringed instruments, and on tambourines, castanets, and cymbals. David and the others were happy, and they danced for the LORD with all their might."
2 Samuel,6,6,"But when they came to Nacon's threshing floor, the oxen stumbled, so Uzzah reached out and took hold of the sacred chest."
2 Samuel,6,7,"The LORD God was very angry with Uzzah for doing this, and he killed Uzzah there beside the chest."
2 Samuel,6,8,"David got angry with God for killing Uzzah. He named that place “Bursting Out Against Uzzah”, and that's what it's still called."
2 Samuel,6,9,"David was afraid of the LORD and thought, “Should I really take the sacred chest to my city?”"
2 Samuel,6,10,"He decided not to take it there. Instead, he turned off the road and took it to the home of Obed-Edom, who was from Gath."
2 Samuel,7,1,"King David moved into his new palace, and the LORD let his kingdom be at peace."
2 Samuel,7,2,"Then one day, as David was talking with Nathan the prophet, David said, “Look around! I live in a palace made of cedar, but the sacred chest has to stay in a tent.”"
2 Samuel,7,3,"Nathan replied, “The LORD is with you, so do what you want!”"
2 Samuel,7,4,"That night, the LORD told Nathan"
2 Samuel,7,5,"to go to David and give him this message: David, you are my servant, so listen to what I say. Why should you build a temple for me?"
2 Samuel,7,6,"I didn't live in a temple when I brought my people out of Egypt, and I don't live in one now. A tent has always been my home wherever I have gone with them."
2 Samuel,7,7,I chose leaders and told them to be like shepherds for my people Israel. But did I ever say anything to even one of them about building a cedar temple for me?
2 Samuel,7,8,"David, this is what I, the LORD All-Powerful, say to you. I brought you in from the fields where you took care of sheep, and I made you the leader of my people."
2 Samuel,7,9,"Wherever you went, I helped you and destroyed your enemies right in front of your eyes. I have made you one of the most famous people in the world."
2 Samuel,7,10,"I have given my people Israel a land of their own where they can live in peace, and they won't have to tremble with fear any more. Evil nations won't bother them, as they did"
2 Samuel,7,11,when I let judges rule my people. And I have kept your enemies from attacking you. Now I promise that you and your descendants will be kings.
2 Samuel,7,12,"I'll choose one of your sons to be king when you reach the end of your life and are buried in the tomb of your ancestors. I'll make him a strong ruler,"
2 Samuel,7,13,and no one will be able to take his kingdom away from him. He will be the one to build a temple for me.
2 Samuel,7,14,"I will be his father, and he will be my son. When he does wrong, I'll see that he is corrected, just as children are corrected by their parents."
2 Samuel,7,15,"But I will never put an end to my agreement with him, as I put an end to my agreement with Saul, who was king before you."
2 Samuel,7,16,I will make sure that one of your descendants will always be king.
2 Samuel,7,17,Nathan told David exactly what he had heard in the vision.
2 Samuel,7,18,"David went into the tent he had set up for the sacred chest. Then he sat there and prayed: LORD All-Powerful, my family and I don't deserve what you have already done for us,"
2 Samuel,7,19,and yet you have promised to do even more. Is this the way you usually treat people?
2 Samuel,7,20,"I am your servant, and you know my thoughts, so there is nothing more that I need to say."
2 Samuel,7,21,"You have done this wonderful thing, and you have let me know about it, because you wanted to keep your promise."
2 Samuel,7,22," LORD All-Powerful, you are greater than all others. No one is like you, and you alone are God. Everything we have heard about you is true."
2 Samuel,7,23,"And there is no other nation on earth like Israel, the nation you rescued from slavery in Egypt to be your own. You became famous by using great and wonderful miracles to force other nations and their gods out of your land, so your people could live here."
2 Samuel,7,24,"You have chosen Israel to be your people for ever, and you have become their God."
2 Samuel,7,25,"And now, LORD God, please do what you have promised me and my descendants."
2 Samuel,7,26,"Then you will be famous for ever, and everyone will say, “The LORD God All-Powerful rules Israel, and David's descendants are his chosen kings.”"
2 Samuel,7,27,"After all, you really are Israel's God, the LORD All-Powerful. You've told me that you will let my descendants be kings. That's why I have the courage to pray to you like this, even though I am only your servant."
2 Samuel,7,28," LORD All-Powerful, you are God. You have promised me some very good things, and you can be trusted to do what you promise."
2 Samuel,7,29,"Please bless my descendants and let them always be your chosen kings. You have already promised, and I'm sure that you will bless my family for ever."
2 Samuel,8,1,"Later, David attacked and badly defeated the Philistines. Israel was now free from their control."
2 Samuel,8,2,"David also defeated the Moabites. Then he made their soldiers lie down on the ground, and he measured them off with a rope. He would measure off two lengths of the rope and have those men killed, then he would measure off one length and let those men live. The people of Moab had to accept David as their ruler and pay taxes to him."
2 Samuel,8,3,"David set out for the River Euphrates to build a monument there. On his way, he defeated the king of Zobah, whose name was Hadadezer the son of Rehob."
2 Samuel,8,4,"In the battle, David captured seventeen hundred cavalry and twenty thousand foot soldiers. He also captured war chariots, but he destroyed all but one hundred of them."
2 Samuel,8,5,"When troops from the Aramean kingdom of Damascus came to help Hadadezer, David killed twenty thousand of them."
2 Samuel,8,6,"He left some of his soldiers in Damascus, and the Arameans had to accept David as their ruler and pay taxes to him. Everywhere David went, the LORD helped him win battles."
2 Samuel,8,7,"Hadadezer's officers had carried their arrows in gold cases hung over their shoulders, but David took these cases and brought them to Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,8,8,"He also took a lot of bronze from the cities of Betah and Berothai, which had belonged to Hadadezer."
2 Samuel,9,1,"One day, David thought, “I wonder if any of Saul's family are still alive. If they are, I will be kind to them, because I made a promise to Jonathan.”"
2 Samuel,9,2,"David called in Ziba, one of the servants of Saul's family. David said, “So you are Ziba.” “Yes, Your Majesty, I am.”"
2 Samuel,9,3,"David asked, “Are any of Saul's family still alive? If there are, I want to be kind to them.” Ziba answered, “One of Jonathan's sons is still alive, but he can't walk.”"
2 Samuel,9,4,"“Where is he?” David asked. Ziba replied, “He lives in Lo-Debar with Machir the son of Ammiel.”"
2 Samuel,10,1,"Some time later, King Nahash of Ammon died, and his son Hanun became king."
2 Samuel,10,2,"David said, “Nahash was kind to me, and I will be kind to his son.” So he sent some officials to the country of Ammon to tell Hanun how sorry he was that his father had died."
2 Samuel,10,3,"But Hanun's officials told him, “Do you really believe David is honouring your father by sending these people to comfort you? He probably sent them to spy on our city, so he can destroy it.”"
2 Samuel,10,4,"Hanun arrested David's officials and had their beards shaved off on one side of their faces. He had their robes cut off just below the waist, and then he sent them away."
2 Samuel,10,5,"They were terribly ashamed. When David found out what had happened to his officials, he sent a message and told them, “Stay in Jericho until your beards grow back. Then you can come home.”"
2 Samuel,10,6,"The Ammonites realized that they had made David very angry, so they hired more foreign soldiers. Twenty thousand of them were foot soldiers from the Aramean cities of Beth-Rehob and Zobah, one thousand were from the king of Maacah, and twelve thousand were from the region of Tob."
2 Samuel,10,7,"David heard what they had done, and he sent out Joab with all his well-trained soldiers."
2 Samuel,10,8,The Ammonite troops came out and got ready to fight in front of the gate to their city. The Arameans from Zobah and Rehob and the soldiers from Tob and Maacah formed a separate group in the nearby fields.
2 Samuel,10,9,"Joab saw that he had to fight in front and behind at the same time, and he picked some of the best Israelite soldiers to fight the Arameans."
2 Samuel,10,10,He put his brother Abishai in command of the rest of the army and made them fight the Ammonites.
2 Samuel,10,11,"Joab told his brother, “If the Arameans are too much for me to handle, you can come and help me. If the Ammonites are too strong for you, I'll come and help you."
2 Samuel,10,12,Be brave and fight hard to protect our people and the cities of our God. I pray that the LORD will do whatever pleases him.”
2 Samuel,10,13,"Joab and his soldiers attacked the Arameans, and the Arameans ran from them."
2 Samuel,10,14,"When the Ammonite soldiers saw that the Arameans had run away, they ran from Abishai's soldiers and went back into their own city. Joab stopped fighting the Ammonites and returned to Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,10,15,"The Arameans realized they had lost the battle, so they brought all their troops together again."
2 Samuel,10,16,"Hadadezer sent messengers to call in the Arameans who were on the other side of the River Euphrates. Then Shobach, the commander of Hadadezer's army, led them to the town of Helam."
2 Samuel,10,17,"David found out what the Arameans were doing, and he brought Israel's whole army together. They crossed the River Jordan and went to Helam, where the Arameans were ready to meet them."
2 Samuel,10,18,"The Arameans attacked, but then they ran from Israel. David killed seven hundred chariot drivers and forty thousand cavalry. He also killed Shobach, their commander."
2 Samuel,10,19,"When the kings who had been under Hadadezer's rule saw that Israel had beaten them, they made peace with Israel and accepted David as their ruler. The Arameans were afraid to help Ammon any more."
2 Samuel,11,1,"It was now spring, the time when kings go to war. David sent out the whole Israelite army under the command of Joab and his officers. They destroyed the Ammonite army and surrounded the capital city of Rabbah, but David stayed in Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,12,1,and he sent Nathan the prophet to tell this story to David: A rich man and a poor man lived in the same town.
2 Samuel,12,2,"The rich man owned a lot of sheep and cattle,"
2 Samuel,12,3,but the poor man had only one little lamb that he had bought and raised. The lamb became a pet for him and his children. He even let it eat from his plate and drink from his cup and sleep on his lap. The lamb was like one of his own children.
2 Samuel,12,4,"One day someone came to visit the rich man, but the rich man didn't want to kill any of his own sheep or cattle and serve it to the visitor. So he stole the poor man's little lamb and served it instead."
2 Samuel,12,5,"David was furious with the rich man and said to Nathan, “I swear by the living LORD that the man who did this deserves to die!"
2 Samuel,12,6,"And because he didn't have any pity on the poor man, he will have to pay four times what the lamb was worth.”"
2 Samuel,12,7,Then Nathan told David: You are that rich man! Now listen to what the LORD God of Israel says to you: “I chose you to be the king of Israel. I kept you safe from Saul
2 Samuel,12,8,"and even gave you his house and his wives. I let you rule Israel and Judah, and if that had not been enough, I would have given you much more."
2 Samuel,12,9,"Why did you disobey me and do such a horrible thing? You murdered Uriah the Hittite by letting the Ammonites kill him, so you could take his wife."
2 Samuel,12,10,"“Because you wouldn't obey me and took Uriah's wife for yourself, your family will never live in peace."
2 Samuel,12,11,"Someone from your own family will cause you a lot of trouble, and I will take your wives and give them to another man before your very eyes. He will go to bed with them while everyone looks on."
2 Samuel,12,12,"What you did was in secret, but I will do this in the open for everyone in Israel to see.”"
2 Samuel,13,1,"David had a beautiful daughter named Tamar, who was the sister of Absalom. She was also the half-sister of Amnon, who fell in love with her."
2 Samuel,13,2,"But Tamar was a virgin, and Amnon could not think of a way to be alone with her. He was so upset about it that he made himself sick."
2 Samuel,13,3,"Amnon had a friend named Jonadab, who was the son of David's brother Shimeah. Jonadab always knew how to get what he wanted,"
2 Samuel,13,4,"and he said to Amnon, “What's the matter? You're the king's son! You shouldn't have to go around feeling sorry for yourself every morning.” Amnon said, “I'm in love with Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.”"
2 Samuel,13,5,"Jonadab told him, “Lie down on your bed and pretend to be sick. When your father comes to see you, ask him to send Tamar, so you can watch her cook something for you. Then she can serve you the food.”"
2 Samuel,13,6,"So Amnon went to bed and pretended to be sick. When the king came to see him, Amnon said, “Please, ask Tamar to come over. She can make some special bread while I watch, and then she can serve me the bread.”"
2 Samuel,13,7,"David told Tamar, “Go over to Amnon's house and prepare him some food.”"
2 Samuel,13,8,"When she got there, he was lying in bed. She mixed the dough, made the loaves, and baked them while he watched."
2 Samuel,13,9,"Then she took the bread out of the pan and put it on his plate, but he refused to eat it. Amnon said, “Send the servants out of the house.” After they had gone,"
2 Samuel,13,10,"he said to Tamar, “Serve the food in my bedroom.” Tamar picked up the bread that she had made and brought it into Amnon's bedroom."
2 Samuel,13,11,"But as she was taking it over to him, he grabbed her and said, “Come to bed with me!”"
2 Samuel,13,12,"She answered, “No! Please don't force me! This sort of thing isn't done in Israel. It's too disgusting!"
2 Samuel,13,13,"Think of me. I'll be disgraced for ever! And think of yourself. Everyone in Israel will say you're nothing but a load of rubbish! Just ask the king, and he will let you marry me.”"
2 Samuel,13,14,"But Amnon would not listen to what she said. He was stronger than she was, so he overpowered her and raped her."
2 Samuel,13,15,"Then Amnon hated her even more than he had loved her before. So he told her, “Get up and get out!”"
2 Samuel,13,16,"She said, “Don't send me away! That would be worse than what you have already done.” But Amnon would not listen."
2 Samuel,13,17,"He called in his servant and said, “Throw this woman out and lock the door!”"
2 Samuel,13,18,"The servant made her leave, and he locked the door behind her. The king's unmarried daughters used to wear long robes with sleeves."
2 Samuel,13,19,Tamar tore the robe she was wearing and put ashes on her head. Then she covered her face with her hands and cried loudly as she walked away.
2 Samuel,13,20,"Tamar's brother Absalom said to her, “How could Amnon have done such a terrible thing to you! But since he's your brother, don't tell anyone what happened. Just try not to think about it.” Tamar soon moved into Absalom's house, but she was always sad and lonely."
2 Samuel,13,21,"When David heard what had happened to Tamar, he was very angry. But Amnon was his eldest son and also his favourite, and David would not do anything to make Amnon unhappy."
2 Samuel,13,22,"Absalom treated Amnon as though nothing had happened, but he hated Amnon for what he had done to his sister Tamar."
2 Samuel,13,23,"Two years later, Absalom's servants were cutting wool from his sheep in Baal-Hazor near the town of Ephraim, and Absalom invited all the king's sons to be there."
2 Samuel,13,24,"Then he went to David and said, “My servants are cutting the wool from my sheep. Please come and join us!”"
2 Samuel,13,25,"David answered, “No, my son, we won't go. It would be too expensive for you.” Absalom tried to get him to change his mind, but David did not want to go. He only said that he hoped they would have a good time."
2 Samuel,13,26,"Absalom said, “If you won't go, at least let my brother Amnon come with us.” David asked, “Why should he go with you?”"
2 Samuel,13,27,"But Absalom kept on insisting, and finally David let Amnon and all his other sons go with Absalom. Absalom prepared a banquet fit for a king."
2 Samuel,13,28,"But he told his servants, “Keep an eye on Amnon. When he gets a little drunk from the wine and is feeling good, I'll give the signal. Then kill him! I've commanded you to do it, so don't be afraid. Be strong and brave.”"
2 Samuel,13,29,"Absalom's servants killed Amnon, just as Absalom had told them. The rest of the king's sons quickly rode away on their mules to escape from Absalom."
2 Samuel,13,30,"While they were on their way to Jerusalem, someone told David, “Absalom has killed all your sons! Not even one is left.”"
2 Samuel,13,31,"David got up, and in his sorrow he tore his clothes and lay down on the ground. His servants remained standing, but they tore their clothes too."
2 Samuel,13,32,"Then David's nephew Jonadab said, “Your Majesty, not all your sons were killed! Only Amnon is dead. On the day that Amnon raped Tamar, Absalom decided to kill him."
2 Samuel,13,33,"Don't worry about the report that all your sons were killed. Only Amnon is dead,"
2 Samuel,13,34,"and Absalom has run away.” One of the guards noticed a lot of people coming along the hillside on the road to Horonaim. He went and told the king, “I saw some men coming along Horonaim Road.”"
2 Samuel,13,35,"Jonadab said, “Your Majesty, look! Here come your sons now, just as I told you.”"
2 Samuel,13,36,"No sooner had he said it, than David's sons came in. They were weeping out loud, and David and all his officials cried just as loudly."
2 Samuel,14,1,"Joab knew that David couldn't stop thinking about Absalom,"
2 Samuel,15,1,"Some time later, Absalom got himself a chariot with horses to pull it, and he had fifty men to run in front."
2 Samuel,15,2,"He would get up early each morning and wait by the side of the road that led to the city gate. Anyone who had a complaint to bring to King David would have to go that way, and Absalom would ask each of them, “Where are you from?” If they said, “I'm from a tribe in the north,”"
2 Samuel,15,3,"Absalom would say, “You deserve to win your case. But the king doesn't have anyone to hear complaints like yours."
2 Samuel,15,4,I wish someone would make me the judge around here! I would be fair to everyone.”
2 Samuel,15,5,"Whenever anyone would come to Absalom and start bowing down, he would reach out and hug and kiss them."
2 Samuel,15,6,That's how he treated everyone from Israel who brought a complaint to the king. Soon everyone in Israel liked Absalom better than they liked David.
2 Samuel,15,7,"Four years later, Absalom said to David, “Please, let me go to Hebron. I have to keep a promise that I made to the LORD,"
2 Samuel,15,8,"when I was living with the Arameans in Geshur. I promised that if the LORD would bring me back to live in Jerusalem, I would worship him in Hebron.”"
2 Samuel,15,9,"David gave his permission, and Absalom went to Hebron."
2 Samuel,16,1,"David had started down the other side of the Mount of Olives, when he was met by Ziba, the chief servant of Mephibosheth. Ziba had two donkeys that were carrying two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred handfuls of raisins, a hundred figs, and some wine."
2 Samuel,16,2,"“What's all this?” David asked. Ziba said, “The donkeys are for your family to ride. The bread and fruit are for the people to eat, and the wine is for them to drink in the desert when they are tired out.”"
2 Samuel,16,3,"“And where is Mephibosheth?” David asked. Ziba answered, “He stayed in Jerusalem, because he thinks the people of Israel want him to rule the kingdom of his grandfather Saul.”"
2 Samuel,16,4,"David then told him, “Everything that used to belong to Mephibosheth is now yours.” Ziba said, “Your Majesty, I am your humble servant, and I hope you will be pleased with me.”"
2 Samuel,16,5,"David was near the town of Bahurim when a man came out and started cursing him. The man was Shimei the son of Gera, and he was one of Saul's distant relatives."
2 Samuel,16,6,"He threw stones at David, at his soldiers, and at everyone else, including the bodyguards who walked on each side of David."
2 Samuel,16,7,"Shimei was yelling at David, “Get out of here, you murderer! You good-for-nothing,"
2 Samuel,16,8,"the LORD is paying you back for killing so many in Saul's family. You stole his kingdom, but now the LORD has given it to your son Absalom. You're a murderer, and that's why you're in such big trouble!”"
2 Samuel,16,9,"Abishai said, “Your Majesty, this man is as useless as a dead dog! He shouldn't be allowed to curse you. Let me go over and chop off his head.”"
2 Samuel,16,10,"David replied, “What will I ever do with you and your brother Joab? If Shimei is cursing me because the LORD has told him to, then who are you to tell him to stop?”"
2 Samuel,16,11,Then David said to Abishai and all his soldiers: My own son is trying to kill me! Why shouldn't this man from the tribe of Benjamin want me dead even more? Let him curse all he wants. Perhaps the LORD did tell him to curse me.
2 Samuel,16,12,"But if the LORD hears these curses and sees the trouble I'm in, perhaps he will have pity on me instead."
2 Samuel,16,13,"David and the others went on down the road. Shimei went along the hillside by the road, cursing and throwing stones and earth at them."
2 Samuel,16,14,"When David and those with him came to the River Jordan, they were tired out. But after they rested, they felt much better."
2 Samuel,16,15,"By this time, Absalom, Ahithophel, and the others had reached Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,16,16,"David's friend Hushai came to Absalom and said, “Long live the king! Long live the king!”"
2 Samuel,16,17,"But Absalom asked Hushai, “Is this how you show loyalty to your friend David? Why didn't you go with him?”"
2 Samuel,16,18,"Hushai answered, “The LORD and the people of Israel have chosen you to be king. I can't leave. I have to stay and serve the one they've chosen."
2 Samuel,16,19,"Besides, it seems right for me to serve you, just as I served your father.”"
2 Samuel,16,20,"Absalom turned to Ahithophel and said, “Give us your advice! What should we do?”"
2 Samuel,16,21,"Ahithophel answered, “Some of your father's wives were left here to take care of the palace. You should have sex with them. Then everyone will find out that you have publicly disgraced your father. This will make you and your followers even more powerful.”"
2 Samuel,16,22,"Absalom had a tent set up on the flat roof of the palace, and everyone watched as he went into the tent with his father's wives."
2 Samuel,16,23,Ahithophel gave such good advice in those days that both Absalom and David thought it came straight from God.
2 Samuel,17,1,"Ahithophel said to Absalom: Let me choose twelve thousand men and attack David tonight,"
2 Samuel,17,2,"while he is tired and discouraged. He will panic, and everyone with him will run away. I won't kill anyone except David,"
2 Samuel,17,3,since he's the one you want to get rid of. Then I'll bring the whole nation back to you like a bride coming home to her husband. This way there won't be a civil war.
2 Samuel,17,4,Absalom and all the leaders of the tribes of Israel agreed that Ahithophel had a good plan.
2 Samuel,17,5,"Then Absalom said, “Bring in Hushai the Archite. Let's hear what he has to say.”"
2 Samuel,17,6,"Hushai came in, and Absalom told him what Ahithophel had planned. Then Absalom said, “Should we do what he says? And if we shouldn't, can you come up with anything better?”"
2 Samuel,17,7,Hushai said: This time Ahithophel's advice isn't so good.
2 Samuel,17,8,"You know that your father and his followers are real warriors. Now they are as fierce as a mother bear whose cubs have just been killed. Besides, your father has a lot of experience in fighting wars, and he won't be spending the night with the others."
2 Samuel,17,9,"He has probably already found a hiding place in a cave or somewhere else. As soon as anyone hears that some of your soldiers have been killed, everyone will think your whole army has been destroyed."
2 Samuel,17,10,Then even those who are as brave as a lion will lose their courage. All Israel knows what a great warrior your father is and what brave soldiers he has.
2 Samuel,17,11,"My advice is to gather all the fighting men of Israel from the town of Dan in the north down to the town of Beersheba in the south. You will have more soldiers than there are grains of sand on the seashore. Absalom, you should lead them yourself,"
2 Samuel,17,12,and we will all go to fight David wherever he is. We will fall on him just as dew falls and covers the ground. He and all his soldiers will die!
2 Samuel,17,13,"If they go into a walled town, we will put ropes around that town and drag it into the river. We won't leave even one small piece of a stone."
2 Samuel,17,14,Absalom and the others liked Hushai's plan better than Ahithophel's plan. This was because the LORD had decided to keep Ahithophel's plan from working and to cause trouble for Absalom.
2 Samuel,17,15,"Straight away, Hushai went to Zadok and Abiathar. He told them what advice Ahithophel had given to Absalom and to the leaders of Israel. He also told them about the advice he had given."
2 Samuel,17,16,"Then he said, “Hurry! Send someone to warn David not to spend the night on this side of the river. He must get across the river, so he and the others won't be wiped out!”"
2 Samuel,17,17,Jonathan and Ahimaaz had been waiting at Rogel Spring because they did not want to be seen in Jerusalem. A servant girl went to the spring and gave them the message for David.
2 Samuel,17,18,But a young man saw them and went to tell Absalom. So Jonathan and Ahimaaz left and hurried to the house of a man who lived in Bahurim. Then they climbed down into a well in the courtyard.
2 Samuel,17,19,"The man's wife put the cover on the well and poured grain on top of it, so the well could not be seen."
2 Samuel,17,20,"Absalom's soldiers came to the woman and demanded, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?” The woman answered, “They went across the stream.” The soldiers went off to look for the two men. But when they did not find the men, they went back to Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,17,21,"After the soldiers had gone, Jonathan and Ahimaaz climbed out of the well. They went to David and said, “Hurry! Get ready to cross the river!” Then they told him about Ahithophel's plan."
2 Samuel,17,22,David and the others got ready and started crossing the River Jordan. By sunrise all of them were on the other side.
2 Samuel,17,23,"When Ahithophel saw that Absalom and the leaders of Israel were not going to follow his advice, he saddled his donkey and rode back to his home in Gilo. He told his family and servants what to do. Then he hanged himself, and they buried him in his family's burial place."
2 Samuel,17,24,"David went to the town of Mahanaim, and Absalom crossed the River Jordan with the army of Israel."
2 Samuel,17,25,"Absalom put Amasa in Joab's place as commander of the army. Amasa's father was Ithra from the family of Ishmael, and his mother was Abigal, the daughter of Nahash and the sister of Joab's mother Zeruiah."
2 Samuel,17,26,The Israelites under Absalom's command set up camp in the region of Gilead.
2 Samuel,17,27,"After David came to the town of Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash came from Rabbah in Ammon, Machir the son of Ammiel came from Lo-Debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite came from Rogelim."
2 Samuel,18,1,David divided his soldiers into groups of a hundred and groups of a thousand. Then he chose officers to be in command of each group.
2 Samuel,18,2,"He sent out one third of his army under the command of Joab, another third under the command of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, and the rest under the command of Ittai from Gath. He told the soldiers, “I'm going into battle with you.”"
2 Samuel,18,3,"But the soldiers said, “No, don't go into battle with us! It won't matter to our enemies if they make us all run away, or even if they kill half of us. But you are worth ten thousand of us. It would be better for you to stay in town and send help if we need it.”"
2 Samuel,19,1,"Someone told Joab, “The king is crying because Absalom is dead.”"
2 Samuel,19,2,"David's army found out he was crying because his son had died, and their day of victory suddenly turned into a day of sadness."
2 Samuel,19,3,"The troops were sneaking into Mahanaim, just as if they had run away from a battle and were ashamed."
2 Samuel,19,4,"David held his hands over his face and kept on crying loudly, “My son, Absalom! Absalom, my son, my son!”"
2 Samuel,19,5,"Joab went to the house where David was staying and told him: You've made your soldiers ashamed! Not only did they save your life, they saved your sons and daughters and wives as well."
2 Samuel,19,6,"You're more loyal to your enemies than to your friends. What you've done today has shown your officers and soldiers that they don't mean a thing to you. You would be happy if Absalom was still alive, even if the rest of us were dead."
2 Samuel,19,7,"Now get up! Go out there and thank them for what they did. If you don't, I swear by the LORD that you won't even have one man left on your side tomorrow morning. You may have had a lot of troubles in the past, but this will be the worst thing that has ever happened to you!"
2 Samuel,19,8,"David got up and went to the town gate and sat down. When the people heard that he was sitting there, they came to see him. After Israel's soldiers had all returned home,"
2 Samuel,20,1,"A troublemaker from the tribe of Benjamin was there. His name was Sheba the son of Bichri, and he blew a trumpet to get everyone's attention. Then he said, “People of Israel, David the son of Jesse doesn't belong to us! Let's go home.”"
2 Samuel,20,2,So they stopped following David and went off with Sheba. But the people of Judah stayed close to David all the way from the Jordan to Jerusalem.
2 Samuel,20,3,"David had left ten of his wives in Jerusalem to take care of his palace. But when he came back, he had them taken to another house, and he placed soldiers there to guard them. He gave them whatever they needed, but he never slept with any of them again. They had to live there for the rest of their lives as if they were widows."
2 Samuel,20,4,"David said to Amasa, “Three days from now I want you and all of Judah's army to be here!”"
2 Samuel,20,5,"Amasa started bringing the army together, but it was taking him more than three days."
2 Samuel,20,6,"So David said to Abishai, “Sheba will hurt us more than Absalom ever did. Take my best soldiers and go after him. We don't want him to take over any walled cities and get away from us.”"
2 Samuel,20,7,"Abishai left Jerusalem to try and capture Sheba. He took along Joab and his soldiers, as well as David's bodyguard and best troops."
2 Samuel,20,8,"They had gone as far as the big rock at Gibeon when Amasa caught up with them. Joab had a dagger strapped around his waist over his military uniform, but it fell out as he started towards Amasa."
2 Samuel,20,9,"Joab said, “Amasa, my cousin, how are you?” Then Joab took hold of Amasa's beard with his right hand, so that he could greet him with a kiss."
2 Samuel,20,10,"Amasa did not see the dagger in Joab's other hand. Joab stuck it in Amasa's stomach, and his insides spilt out on the ground. Joab only struck him once, but Amasa was dying. Joab and his brother Abishai went off to chase Sheba."
2 Samuel,20,11,"One of Joab's soldiers stood by Amasa and shouted, “If any of you like Joab, and if you are for David, then follow Joab!”"
2 Samuel,20,12,"Amasa was still rolling in his own blood in the middle of the road. The soldier who had shouted noticed that everyone who passed by would stop, so he dragged Amasa off the road and covered him with a blanket."
2 Samuel,20,13,"After this, no one else stopped. They all walked straight past him on their way to help Joab capture Sheba."
2 Samuel,20,14,Sheba had gone through all the tribes of Israel when he came to the town of Abel Beth-Maacah. All his best soldiers met him there and followed him into the town.
2 Samuel,20,15,"Joab and his troops came and surrounded Abel, so that no one could go in or come out. They made an earth ramp up to the town wall and then started to use a battering ram to knock the wall down."
2 Samuel,20,16,"A wise woman shouted from the top of the wall, “Listen to me! Listen to me! I have to talk to Joab! Tell him to come here!”"
2 Samuel,20,17,"When he came, the woman said, “Are you Joab?” “Yes, I am,” he answered. She said, “Please, listen to what I have to say.” “All right,” he said. “I'll listen.”"
2 Samuel,20,18,"She said, “Long ago people used to say, ‘If you want good advice, go to the town of Abel to get it.’ The answers they got here were all that was needed to settle any problem."
2 Samuel,20,19,"We are Israelites, and we want peace! You can trust us. Why are you trying to destroy a town that's like a mother in Israel? Why do you want to wipe out the LORD 's people?”"
2 Samuel,20,20,"Joab answered, “No, no! I'm not trying to wipe you out or destroy your town!"
2 Samuel,20,21,"That's not it at all. There's a man in your town from the hill country of Ephraim. His name is Sheba, and he is the leader of a rebellion against King David. Turn him over to me, and we will leave your town alone.” The woman told Joab, “We will throw his head over the wall.”"
2 Samuel,20,22,"She went to the people of the town and talked them into doing it. They cut off Sheba's head and threw it to Joab. Joab blew a signal on his trumpet, and the soldiers returned to their homes. Joab went back to David in Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,20,23,Joab was the commander of Israel's entire army. Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was in command of David's bodyguard.
2 Samuel,20,24,Adoram was in charge of the slave labour force. Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud kept government records.
2 Samuel,20,25,Sheva was the secretary. Zadok and Abiathar were the priests.
2 Samuel,20,26,Ira from Jair was David's priest.
2 Samuel,21,1,"While David was king, there were three years in a row when the nation of Israel could not grow enough food. So David asked the LORD for help, and the LORD answered, “Saul and his family are guilty of murder, because he had the Gibeonites killed.”"
2 Samuel,21,2,"The Gibeonites were not Israelites; they were descendants of the Amorites. The people of Israel had promised not to kill them, but Saul had tried to kill them because he wanted Israel and Judah to control all the land. David called the Gibeonites to him, and he talked with them."
2 Samuel,21,3,"He said, “What can I do to make up for what Saul did, so that you'll ask the LORD to be kind to his people again?”"
2 Samuel,21,4,"The Gibeonites answered, “Silver and gold from Saul and his family are not enough. On the other hand, we don't have the right to put any Israelite to death.” David said, “I'll do whatever you ask.”"
2 Samuel,21,5,"They replied, “Saul tried to kill all our people so that none of us would be left in the land of Israel."
2 Samuel,21,6,"Give us seven of his descendants. We will hang these men near the place where the LORD is worshipped in Gibeah, the home town of Saul, the LORD 's chosen king.” “I'll give them to you,” David said."
2 Samuel,21,7,"David had made a promise to Jonathan with the LORD as his witness, so he spared Jonathan's son Mephibosheth, the grandson of Saul."
2 Samuel,21,8,But Saul and Rizpah the daughter of Aiah had two sons named Armoni and Mephibosheth. Saul's daughter Merab had five sons whose father was Adriel the son of Barzillai from Meholah. David took Rizpah's two sons and Merab's five sons and
2 Samuel,21,9,"turned them over to the Gibeonites, who hanged all seven of them on the mountain near the place where the LORD was worshipped. This happened right at the beginning of the barley harvest."
2 Samuel,21,10,"Rizpah spread out some sackcloth on a nearby rock. She wouldn't let the birds land on the bodies during the day, and she kept the wild animals away at night. She stayed there from the beginning of the harvest until it started to rain."
2 Samuel,22,1,"David sang a song to the LORD after the LORD had rescued him from his enemies, especially Saul. These are the words to David's song:"
2 Samuel,22,2,"Our LORD and our God, you are my mighty rock, my fortress, my protector."
2 Samuel,22,3,"You are the rock where I am safe. You are my shield, my powerful weapon, and my place of shelter. You rescue me and keep me from being hurt."
2 Samuel,22,4,"I praise you, our LORD! I prayed to you, and you rescued me from my enemies."
2 Samuel,22,5,"Death, like ocean waves, surrounded me, and I was almost swallowed by its flooding waters."
2 Samuel,22,6,"Ropes from the world of the dead had coiled around me, and death had set a trap in my path."
2 Samuel,22,7,"I was in terrible trouble when I called out to you, but from your temple you heard me and answered my prayer."
2 Samuel,22,8,Earth shook and shivered! The columns supporting the sky rocked back and forth. You were angry
2 Samuel,22,9,and breathed out smoke. Scorching heat and fiery flames spewed from your mouth.
2 Samuel,22,10,"You opened the heavens like curtains, and you came down with storm clouds under your feet."
2 Samuel,22,11,You rode on the backs of flying creatures. You appeared with the wind as wings.
2 Samuel,22,12,"Darkness was your tent! Thunderclouds filled the sky, hiding you from sight."
2 Samuel,22,13,Fiery coals lit up the sky in front of you.
2 Samuel,22,14," LORD Most High, your voice thundered from the heavens."
2 Samuel,22,15,You scattered your enemies with arrows of lightning.
2 Samuel,22,16,"You roared at the sea, and its deepest channels could be seen. You snorted, and the earth shook to its foundations."
2 Samuel,22,17,"You reached down from heaven, and you lifted me from deep in the ocean."
2 Samuel,22,18,You rescued me from enemies who were hateful and too powerful for me.
2 Samuel,22,19,"On the day disaster struck, they came and attacked, but you defended me."
2 Samuel,22,20,"When I was fenced in, you freed and rescued me because you love me."
2 Samuel,22,21,"You are good to me, LORD, because I do right, and you reward me because I am innocent."
2 Samuel,22,22,I do what you want and never turn to do evil.
2 Samuel,22,23,I keep your laws in mind and never turn away from your teachings.
2 Samuel,22,24,I obey you completely and guard against sin.
2 Samuel,22,25,You have been good to me because I do right; you have rewarded me for being innocent by your standards.
2 Samuel,22,26,"You are always loyal to your loyal people, and you are faithful to the faithful."
2 Samuel,22,27,"With all who are sincere you are sincere, but you treat the unfaithful as their deeds deserve."
2 Samuel,22,28,"You rescue the humble, but you look for ways to put down the proud."
2 Samuel,22,29,"Our LORD and God, you are my lamp. You turn darkness to light."
2 Samuel,22,30,You help me defeat armies and capture cities.
2 Samuel,22,31,"Your way is perfect, LORD, and your word is correct. You are a shield for those who run to you for help."
2 Samuel,22,32,You alone are God! Only you are a mighty rock.
2 Samuel,22,33,"You are my strong fortress, and you set me free."
2 Samuel,22,34,"You make my feet run as fast as those of a deer, and you help me stand on the mountains."
2 Samuel,22,35,You teach my hands to fight and my arms to use a bow of bronze.
2 Samuel,22,36,"You alone are my shield, and by coming to help me, you have made me famous."
2 Samuel,22,37,"You clear the way for me, and now I won't stumble."
2 Samuel,22,38,I kept chasing my enemies until I caught them and destroyed them.
2 Samuel,22,39,"I destroyed them! I stuck my sword through my enemies, and they were crushed under my feet."
2 Samuel,22,40,You helped me win victories and forced my attackers to fall victim to me.
2 Samuel,22,41,"You made my enemies run, and I killed them."
2 Samuel,22,42,"They cried out for help, but no one saved them; they called out to you, but there was no answer."
2 Samuel,22,43,"I ground them to dust, and I squashed them like mud in the streets."
2 Samuel,22,44,"You rescued me from my stubborn people and made me the leader of foreign nations, who are now my slaves."
2 Samuel,22,45,They obey and come crawling.
2 Samuel,22,46,They have lost all courage and from their fortresses they come trembling.
2 Samuel,22,47,You are the living LORD! I will praise you! You are a mighty rock. I will honour you for keeping me safe.
2 Samuel,22,48,"You took revenge for me, and you put nations in my power."
2 Samuel,22,49,"You protected me from violent enemies, and you made me much greater than all of them."
2 Samuel,22,50,"I will praise you, LORD, and I will honour you among the nations."
2 Samuel,22,51,You give glorious victories to your chosen king. Your faithful love for David and for his descendants will never end.
2 Samuel,23,1,"These are the last words of David the son of Jesse. The God of Jacob chose David and made him a great king. The Mighty God of Israel loved him. When God told him to speak, David said:"
2 Samuel,23,2,The Spirit of the LORD has told me what to say.
2 Samuel,23,3,"Our Mighty Rock, the God of Jacob, told me, “A ruler who obeys God and does right"
2 Samuel,23,4,"is like the sunrise on a cloudless day, or like rain that sparkles on the grass.”"
2 Samuel,23,5,"I have ruled this way, and God will never break his promise to me. God's promise is complete and unchanging; he will always help me and give me what I hope for."
2 Samuel,23,6,"But evil people are pulled up like thorn bushes. They are not dug up by hand,"
2 Samuel,23,7,but with a sharp spear and are burnt on the spot.
2 Samuel,23,8,"These are the names of David's warriors: Ishbosheth the son of Hachmon was the leader of the Three Warriors. In one battle, he killed eight hundred men with his spear."
2 Samuel,23,9,"The next one of the Three Warriors was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite. One time when the Philistines were at war with Israel, he and David dared the Philistines to fight them. Every one of the Israelite soldiers turned and ran,"
2 Samuel,23,10,"except Eleazar. He killed Philistines until his hand was cramped, and he couldn't let go of his sword. When Eleazar finished, all the Israelite troops had to do was come back and take the enemies' weapons and armour. The LORD gave Israel a great victory that day."
2 Samuel,23,11,"Next was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. One time the Philistines brought their army together to destroy a crop of peas growing in a field near Lehi. The rest of Israel's soldiers ran away from the Philistines,"
2 Samuel,23,12,"but Shammah stood in the middle of the field and killed the Philistines. The crops were saved, and the LORD gave Israel a great victory."
2 Samuel,23,13,"One year at harvest time, the Three Warriors went to meet David at Adullam Cave. The Philistine army had set up camp in Rephaim Valley"
2 Samuel,23,14,"and had taken over Bethlehem. David was in his fortress,"
2 Samuel,23,15,"and he was very thirsty. He said, “I wish I had a drink from the well by the gate at Bethlehem.”"
2 Samuel,23,16,"The Three Warriors sneaked into the Philistine camp and got some water from the well near Bethlehem's gate. But after they brought the water back to David, he refused to drink it. Instead, he poured it out as a sacrifice"
2 Samuel,23,17,"and said to the LORD , “I can't drink this water! It's like the blood of these men who risked their lives to get it for me.” The Three Warriors did these brave deeds."
2 Samuel,23,18,"Joab's brother Abishai was the leader of the Thirty Warriors, and in one battle he killed three hundred men with his spear. He was as famous as the Three Warriors"
2 Samuel,23,19,"and certainly just as famous as the rest of the Thirty Warriors. He was the commander of the Thirty Warriors, but he still did not become one of the Three Warriors."
2 Samuel,23,20,"Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was a brave man from Kabzeel who did some amazing things. He killed two of Moab's best fighters, and on a snowy day he went down into a pit and killed a lion."
2 Samuel,23,21,"Another time, he killed an Egyptian, as big as a giant. The Egyptian was armed with a spear, but Benaiah only had a club. Benaiah grabbed the spear from the Egyptian and killed him with it."
2 Samuel,24,1,"The LORD was angry with Israel again, and he made David think it would be a good idea to count the people in Israel and Judah."
2 Samuel,24,2,"So David told Joab and the army officers, “Go to every tribe in Israel, from the town of Dan in the north all the way south to Beersheba, and count everyone who can serve in the army. I want to know how many there are.”"
2 Samuel,24,3,"Joab answered, “I hope the LORD your God will give you a hundred times more soldiers than you already have. I hope you will live to see that day! But why do you want to do a thing like this?”"
2 Samuel,24,4,"But when David refused to change his mind, Joab and the army officers went out and started counting the people."
2 Samuel,24,5,They crossed the River Jordan and began with Aroer and the town in the middle of the river valley. From there they went towards Gad and on as far as Jazer.
2 Samuel,24,6,"They went to Gilead and to Kadesh in Syria. Then they went to Dan, Ijon, and on towards Sidon."
2 Samuel,24,7,"They came to the fortress of Tyre, then went through every town of the Hivites and the Canaanites. Finally, they went to Beersheba in the Southern Desert of Judah."
2 Samuel,24,8,"After they had gone through the whole land, they went back to Jerusalem. It had taken them nine months and twenty days."
2 Samuel,24,9,"Joab came and told David, “In Israel there are eight hundred thousand who can serve in the army, and in Judah there are five hundred thousand.”"
2 Samuel,24,10,"After David had everyone counted, he felt guilty and told the LORD , “What I did was stupid and terribly wrong. LORD , please forgive me.”"
2 Samuel,24,11,"Before David even got up the next morning, the LORD had told David's prophet Gad"
