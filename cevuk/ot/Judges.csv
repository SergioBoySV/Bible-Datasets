Judges,1,1,"After the death of Joshua, the Israelites asked the LORD , “Which of our tribes should attack the Canaanites first?”"
Judges,1,2,“Judah!” the LORD answered. “I'll help them take the land.”
Judges,1,3,"The people of Judah went to their relatives, the Simeon tribe, and said, “Canaanites live in the land God gave us. Help us fight them, and we will help you.” Troops from Simeon came to help Judah."
Judges,2,1,"The LORD 's angel went from Gilgal to Bochim and gave the Israelites this message from the LORD: I promised your ancestors that I would give this land to their families, and I brought your people here from Egypt. We made an agreement that I promised never to break,"
Judges,2,2,"and you promised not to make any peace treaties with the other nations that live in the land. Besides that, you agreed to tear down the altars where they sacrifice to their idols. But you didn't keep your promise."
Judges,2,3,"And so, I'll stop helping you defeat your enemies. Instead, they will be there to trap you into worshipping their idols."
Judges,2,4,"The Israelites started crying loudly,"
Judges,2,5,"and they offered sacrifices to the LORD . From then on, they called that place “Crying”."
Judges,4,1,"After the death of Ehud, the Israelites again started disobeying the LORD."
Judges,4,2,"So the LORD let the Canaanite King Jabin of Hazor conquer Israel. Sisera, the commander of Jabin's army, lived in Harosheth-Ha-Goiim."
Judges,4,3,"Jabin's army had nine hundred iron chariots, and for twenty years he made life miserable for the Israelites, until finally they begged the LORD for help."
Judges,4,4,Deborah the wife of Lappidoth was a prophet and a leader of Israel during those days.
Judges,4,5,"She would sit under Deborah's Palm Tree between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, where Israelites would come and ask her to settle their legal cases."
Judges,4,6,"One day, Barak the son of Abinoam was in Kedesh in Naphtali, and Deborah sent word for him to come and talk with her. When he arrived, she said: I have a message for you from the LORD God of Israel! You are to get together an army of ten thousand men from the Naphtali and Zebulun tribes and lead them to Mount Tabor."
Judges,4,7,"The LORD will trick Sisera into coming out to fight you at the River Kishon. Sisera will be leading King Jabin's army as usual, and they will have their chariots, but the LORD has promised to help you defeat them."
Judges,4,8,“I'm not going unless you go!” Barak told her.
Judges,4,9,"“All right, I'll go!” she replied. “But I'm warning you that the LORD is going to let a woman defeat Sisera, and no one will honour you for winning the battle.” Deborah and Barak left for Kedesh,"
Judges,4,10,"where Barak called together the troops from Zebulun and Naphtali. Ten thousand soldiers gathered there, and Barak led them out from Kedesh. Deborah went too."
Judges,4,11,"At this time, Heber of the Kenite clan was living near the village of Oak in Zaanannim, not far from Kedesh. The Kenites were descendants of Hobab, the father-in-law of Moses, but Heber had moved and had set up his tents away from the rest of the clan."
Judges,4,12,"When Sisera learnt that Barak had led an army to Mount Tabor,"
Judges,4,13,he called his troops together and got all nine hundred iron chariots ready. Then he led his army away from Harosheth-Ha-Goiim to the River Kishon.
Judges,4,14,"Deborah shouted, “Barak, it's time to attack Sisera! Because today the LORD is going to help you defeat him. In fact, the LORD has already gone on ahead to fight for you.” Barak led his ten thousand troops down from Mount Tabor."
Judges,4,15,"And during the battle, the LORD confused Sisera, his chariot drivers, and his whole army. Everyone was so afraid of Barak and his army, that even Sisera jumped down from his chariot and tried to escape."
Judges,4,16,Barak's forces went after Sisera's chariots and army as far as Harosheth-Ha-Goiim. Sisera's entire army was wiped out.
Judges,4,17,"Only Sisera escaped. He ran to Heber's camp, because Heber and his family had a peace treaty with the king of Hazor. Sisera went to the tent that belonged to Jael, Heber's wife."
Judges,4,18,"She came out to greet him and said, “Come in, sir! Please come on in. Don't be afraid.” After they had gone inside, Sisera lay down, and Jael covered him with a blanket."
Judges,4,19,"“Could I have a little water?” he asked. “I'm thirsty.” Jael opened a leather bottle and poured him some milk, then she covered him up again."
Judges,4,20,"“Stand at the entrance to the tent,” Sisera told her. “If someone comes by and asks if anyone is inside, tell them ‘No.’ ”"
Judges,4,21,"Sisera was exhausted and soon fell fast asleep. Jael took a hammer and drove a tent peg through his head into the ground, and he died."
Judges,4,22,"Meanwhile, Barak had been following Sisera, and Jael went out to meet him. “The man you're looking for is inside,” she said. “Come in and I'll show him to you.” They went inside, and there was Sisera—dead and stretched out with a tent peg through his skull."
Judges,4,23,"That same day the Israelites defeated the Canaanite King Jabin, and his army was no longer powerful enough to attack the Israelites."
Judges,4,24,"Jabin grew weaker while the Israelites kept growing stronger, and at last the Israelites destroyed him."
Judges,5,1,"After the battle was over that day, Deborah and Barak sang this song:"
Judges,5,2,"We praise you, LORD! Our soldiers volunteered, ready to follow you."
Judges,5,3,"Listen, kings and rulers, while I sing for the LORD, the God of Israel."
Judges,6,1,"Then once again the Israelites started disobeying the LORD , so he let the nation of Midian control Israel for seven years."
Judges,6,2,The Midianites were so cruel that many Israelites ran to the mountains and hid in caves.
Judges,6,3,"Every time the Israelites would plant crops, the Midianites invaded Israel together with the Amalekites and other eastern nations."
Judges,7,1,"Early the next morning, Gideon and his army got up and moved their camp to Fear Spring. The Midianite camp was to the north, in the valley at the foot of Moreh Hill."
Judges,7,2,"The LORD said, “Gideon, your army is too big. I can't let you win with this many soldiers. The Israelites would think that they had won the battle all by themselves and that I didn't have anything to do with it."
Judges,7,3,"So call your troops together and tell them that anyone who is really afraid can leave Mount Gilead and go home.” Twenty-two thousand men returned home, leaving Gideon with only ten thousand soldiers."
Judges,7,4,"“Gideon,” the LORD said, “you still have too many soldiers. Take them down to the spring and I'll test them. I'll tell you which ones can go along with you and which ones must go back home.”"
Judges,7,5,"When Gideon led his army down to the spring, the LORD told him, “Watch how each man gets a drink of water. Then divide them into two groups—those who lap the water like a dog and those who kneel down to drink.”"
Judges,7,6,"Three hundred men scooped up water in their hands and lapped it, and the rest knelt to get a drink."
Judges,7,7,"The LORD said, “Gideon, your army will be made up of everyone who lapped the water from their hands. Send the others home. I'm going to rescue Israel by helping you and your army of three hundred defeat the Midianites.”"
Judges,7,8,"Then Gideon gave these orders, “You three hundred men stay here. The rest of you may go home, but leave your food and trumpets with us.” Gideon's army camp was on top of a hill overlooking the Midianite camp in the valley."
Judges,7,9,"That night, the LORD said to Gideon. “Get up! Attack the Midianite camp. I am going to let you defeat them,"
Judges,7,10,"but if you're still afraid, you and your servant Purah should sneak down to their camp."
Judges,7,11,"When you hear what the Midianites are saying, you'll be brave enough to attack.” Gideon and Purah worked their way to the edge of the enemy camp, where soldiers were on guard duty."
Judges,7,12,"The camp was huge. The Midianites, Amalekites, and other eastern nations covered the valley like a swarm of locusts. And it would be easier to count the grains of sand on a beach than to count their camels."
Judges,7,13,"Gideon overheard one enemy guard telling another, “I had a dream about a flat loaf of barley bread that came tumbling into our camp. It hit the headquarters tent, and the tent tipped over and fell down.”"
Judges,7,14,"The other soldier answered, “Your dream must have been about Gideon, the Israelite commander. It means God will let him and his army defeat the Midianite army and everyone else in our camp.”"
Judges,7,15,"As soon as Gideon heard about the dream and what it meant, he bowed down to praise God. Then he went back to the Israelite camp and shouted, “Let's go! The LORD is going to let us defeat the Midianite army.”"
Judges,7,16,"Gideon divided his little army into three groups of one hundred men, and he gave each soldier a trumpet and a large clay jar with a burning torch inside."
Judges,8,1,"But the men were really upset with Gideon and complained, “When you went to war with Midian, you didn't ask us to help! Why did you treat us like that?”"
Judges,8,2,"Gideon answered: Don't be upset! Even though you came later, you were able to do much more than I did. It's just like the grape harvest: the grapes your tribe doesn't even bother to pick are better than the best grapes my family can grow."
Judges,8,3,"Besides, God chose you to capture Raven and Wolf. I didn't do a thing compared to you. By the time Gideon had finished talking, the men of Ephraim had calmed down and were no longer angry with him."
Judges,8,4,"After Gideon and his three hundred troops had chased the Midianites as far as the River Jordan, they were exhausted."
Judges,8,5,"The town of Succoth was nearby, so he went there and asked, “Please give my troops some food. They are worn out, but we have to keep chasing Zebah and Zalmunna, the two Midianite kings.”"
Judges,8,6,"The town leaders of Succoth answered, “Why should we feed your army? We don't know if you really will defeat Zebah and Zalmunna.”"
Judges,8,7,"“Just wait!” Gideon said. “After the LORD helps me defeat them, I'm coming back here. I'll make a whip out of thorns and rip the flesh from your bones.”"
Judges,8,8,"After leaving Succoth, Gideon went to Penuel and asked the leaders there for some food. But he got the same answer as he had got at Succoth."
Judges,8,9,"“I'll come back safe and sound,” Gideon said, “but when I do, I'm going to tear down your tower!”"
Judges,8,10,"Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with an army of fifteen thousand troops. They were all that was left of the army of the eastern nations, because one hundred and twenty thousand of their warriors had been killed in the battle."
Judges,8,11,"Gideon reached the enemy camp by going east along Nomad Road past Nobah and Jogbehah. He made a surprise attack,"
Judges,8,12,"and the enemy panicked. Zebah and Zalmunna tried to escape, but Gideon chased and captured them."
Judges,8,13,"After the battle, Gideon set out for home. As he was going through Heres Pass,"
Judges,8,14,"he caught a young man who lived in Succoth. Gideon asked him who the town officials of Succoth were, and the young man wrote down seventy-seven names."
Judges,8,15,"Gideon went to the town officials and said, “Here are Zebah and Zalmunna. Remember how you made fun of me? You said, ‘We don't know if you really will defeat those two Midianite kings. So why should we feed your worn out army?’ ”"
Judges,8,16,Gideon made a whip from thorn plants and used it to beat the town officials.
Judges,8,17,"Afterwards he went to Penuel, where he tore down the tower and killed all the town officials there."
Judges,8,18,"Then Gideon said, “Zebah and Zalmunna, tell me about the men you killed at Tabor.” “They were a lot like you,” the two kings answered. “They were dignified, almost like royalty.”"
Judges,8,19,"“They were my very own brothers!” Gideon said. “I swear by the living LORD that if you had let them live, I would let you live.”"
Judges,8,20,"Gideon turned to Jether, his eldest son. “Kill them!” Gideon said. But Jether was young, and he was too afraid even to pull out his sword."
Judges,8,21,"“What's the matter, Gideon?” Zebah and Zalmunna asked. “Do it yourself, if you're not too much of a coward!” Gideon jumped up and killed them both. Then he took the fine gold ornaments from the necks of their camels."
Judges,8,22,"After the battle with the Midianites, the Israelites said, “Gideon, you rescued us! Now we want you to be our king. Then after your death, your son and then your grandson will rule.”"
Judges,8,23,"“No,” Gideon replied, “I won't be your king, and my son won't be king either. Only the LORD is your ruler."
Judges,8,24,"But I will ask you to do one thing: give me all the earrings you took from the enemy.” The enemy soldiers had been Ishmaelites, and they wore gold earrings."
Judges,8,25,"The Israelite soldiers replied, “Of course we will give you the earrings.” Then they spread out a robe on the ground and tossed the earrings on it."
Judges,8,26,"The total weight of this gold was nearly twenty kilogrammes. In addition, there was the gold from the camels' ornaments and from the beautiful jewellery worn by the Midianite kings. Gideon also took their purple robes."
Judges,9,1,"Abimelech the son of Gideon went to Shechem. While there, he met with his mother's relatives"
Judges,9,2,"and told them to say to the leaders of Shechem, “Do you think it would be good to have all seventy of Gideon's sons ruling us? Wouldn't you rather have just one man as king? Abimelech would make a good king, and he's related to us.”"
Judges,9,3,"Abimelech's uncles talked it over with the leaders of Shechem who agreed, “Yes, it would be better for one of our relatives to be king.”"
Judges,9,4,Then they gave Abimelech seventy pieces of silver from the temple of their god Baal Berith. Abimelech used the silver to hire a gang of rough soldiers who would do anything for money.
Judges,9,5,"Abimelech and his soldiers went to his father's home in Ophrah and brought out Gideon's other sons to a large rock, where they murdered all seventy. Gideon's youngest son Jotham hid from the soldiers, but he was the only one who escaped."
Judges,9,6,"The leaders of Shechem, including the priests and the military officers, met at the tree next to the sacred rock in Shechem to crown Abimelech king."
Judges,9,7,"Jotham heard what they were doing. So he climbed to the top of Mount Gerizim and shouted down to the people who were there at the meeting: Leaders of Shechem, listen to me, and perhaps God will listen to you."
Judges,9,8,"Once the trees searched for someone to be king; they asked the olive tree, “Will you be our king?”"
Judges,9,9,"But the olive tree replied, “My oil brings honour to people and gods. I won't stop making oil, just so my branches can wave above the other trees.”"
Judges,9,10,"Then they asked the fig tree, “Will you be our king?”"
Judges,9,11,"But the fig tree replied, “I won't stop growing my delicious fruit, just so my branches can wave above the other trees.”"
Judges,9,12,"Next they asked the grapevine, “Will you be our king?”"
Judges,9,13,"But the grapevine replied, “My wine brings cheer to people and gods. I won't stop making wine, just so my branches can wave above the other trees.”"
Judges,9,14,"Finally, they went to the thorn bush and asked, “Will you be our king?”"
Judges,9,15,"The thorn bush replied, “If you really want me to be your king, then come into my shade and I will protect you. But if you're deceiving me, I'll start a fire that will spread out and destroy the cedars of Lebanon.” After Jotham had finished telling this story, he said:"
Judges,10,1,"Tola was the next person to rescue Israel. He belonged to the Issachar tribe, but he lived in Shamir, a town in the hill country of Ephraim. His father was Puah, and his grandfather was Dodo."
Judges,10,2,"Tola was a leader of Israel for twenty-three years, then he died and was buried in Shamir."
Judges,10,3,"The next leader of Israel was Jair, who lived in Gilead. He was a leader for twenty-two years."
Judges,10,4,"He had thirty sons, and each son had his own mule and was in charge of one town in Gilead. Those thirty towns are still called The Settlements of Jair."
Judges,10,5,"When he died, he was buried in the town of Kamon."
Judges,10,6,"Before long, the Israelites began disobeying the LORD by worshipping Baal, Astarte, and gods from Syria, Sidon, Moab, Ammon, and Philistia."
Judges,10,7,The LORD was angry with Israel and decided to let Philistia and Ammon conquer them.
Judges,10,8,"So the same year that Jair died, Israel's army was crushed by these two nations. For eighteen years, Ammon was cruel to the Israelites who lived in Gilead, the region east of the River Jordan that had once belonged to the Amorites."
Judges,10,9,"Then the Ammonites began crossing the Jordan and attacking the tribes of Judah, Benjamin, and Ephraim. Life was miserable for the Israelites."
Judges,10,10,"They begged the LORD for help and confessed, “We were unfaithful to you, our LORD . We stopped worshipping you and started worshipping idols of Baal.”"
Judges,12,1,"The men of the Ephraim tribe got together an army and went across the River Jordan to Zaphon to meet with Jephthah. They said, “Why did you go to war with the Ammonites without asking us to help? Just for that, we're going to burn down your house with you inside!”"
Judges,12,2,"“But I did ask for your help,” Jephthah answered. “That was back when the people of Gilead and I were having trouble with the Ammonites, and you wouldn't do a thing to help us."
Judges,12,3,"So when we realized you weren't coming, we risked our lives and attacked the Ammonites. And the LORD let us defeat them. There's no reason for you to come here today to attack me.”"
Judges,12,4,"But the men from Ephraim said, “You people of Gilead are nothing more than refugees from Ephraim. You even live on land that belongs to the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh.” So Jephthah called together the army of Gilead, then they attacked and defeated the army from Ephraim."
Judges,12,5,"The army of Gilead also posted guards at all the places where the soldiers from Ephraim could cross the River Jordan to return to their own land. Whenever one of the men from Ephraim would try to cross the river, the guards would say, “Are you from Ephraim?” “No,” the man would answer, “I'm not from Ephraim.”"
Judges,12,6,"The guards would then tell them to say “Shibboleth”, because they knew that people of Ephraim could say “Sibboleth”, but not “Shibboleth”. If the man said “Sibboleth”, the guards would grab him and kill him there. Altogether, forty-two thousand men from Ephraim were killed in the battle and at the Jordan."
Judges,12,7,"Jephthah was a leader of Israel for six years, before he died and was buried in his home town Mizpah in Gilead."
Judges,12,8,"Ibzan, the next leader of Israel, came from Bethlehem."
Judges,12,9,"He had thirty daughters and thirty sons, and he let them all marry outside his clan. Ibzan was a leader for seven years,"
Judges,12,10,before he died and was buried in Bethlehem.
Judges,12,11,"Elon from the Zebulun tribe was the next leader of Israel. He was a leader for ten years,"
Judges,12,12,before he died and was buried in Aijalon that belonged to the Zebulun tribe.
Judges,13,1,Once again the Israelites started disobeying the LORD . So he let the Philistines take control of Israel for forty years.
Judges,13,2,"Manoah from the tribe of Dan lived in the town of Zorah. His wife was not able to have children,"
Judges,14,1,"One day, Samson went to Timnah, where he saw a Philistine woman."
Judges,14,2,"When he got back home, he told his parents, “I saw a Philistine woman in Timnah, and I want to marry her. Get her for me!”"
Judges,14,3,"His parents answered, “There are a lot of women in our clan and even more in the rest of Israel. Those Philistines are pagans. Why would you want to marry one of their women?” “She looks good to me,” Samson answered. “Get her for me!”"
Judges,14,4,"At that time, the Philistines were in control of Israel, and the LORD wanted to stir up trouble for them. That's why he made Samson desire that woman."
Judges,14,5,"As Samson and his parents reached the vineyards near Timnah, a fierce young lion suddenly roared and attacked Samson."
Judges,14,6,"But the LORD 's Spirit took control of Samson, and with his bare hands he tore the lion apart, as though it had been a young goat. His parents didn't know what he had done, and he didn't tell them."
Judges,14,7,"When they got to Timnah, Samson talked to the woman, and he was sure that she was the one for him."
Judges,14,8,"Later, Samson returned to Timnah for the wedding. And when he came near the place where the lion had attacked, he left the road to see what was left of the lion. He was surprised to see that bees were living in the lion's skeleton, and that they had made some honey."
Judges,14,9,"He scooped up the honey in his hands and ate some of it as he walked along. When he got back to his parents, he gave them some of the honey, and they ate it too. But he didn't tell them he had found the honey in the skeleton of a lion."
Judges,14,10,"While Samson's father went to make the final arrangements with the bride and her family, Samson threw a big party, as grooms usually did."
Judges,14,11,"When the Philistines saw what Samson was like, they told thirty of their young men to stay with him at the party."
Judges,14,12,"Samson told the thirty young men, “This party will last for seven days. Let's make a bet: I'll tell you a riddle, and if you can tell me the right answer before the party is over, I'll give each one of you a shirt and a full change of clothing."
Judges,14,13,"But if you can't tell me the answer, then each of you will have to give me a shirt and a full change of clothing.” “It's a bet!” the Philistines said. “Tell us the riddle.”"
Judges,14,14,"Samson said: Once so strong and mighty— now so sweet and tasty! Three days went by, and the Philistine young men had not come up with the right answer."
Judges,14,15,"Finally, on the seventh day of the party they went to Samson's bride and said, “You had better trick your husband into telling you the answer to his riddle. Have you invited us here just to rob us? If you don't find out the answer, we will burn you and your family to death.”"
Judges,14,16,"Samson's bride went to him and started crying in his arms. “You must really hate me,” she sobbed. “If you loved me at all, you would have told me the answer to your riddle.” “But I haven't even told my parents the answer!” Samson replied. “Why should I tell you?”"
Judges,14,17,"For the entire seven days of the party, she had been whining and trying to get the answer from him. But that seventh day she put so much pressure on Samson that he finally gave in and told her the answer. She went straight to the young men and told them."
Judges,14,18,"Before sunset that day, the men of the town went to Samson with this answer: A lion is the strongest— honey is the sweetest! Samson replied, This answer you have given me doubtless came from my bride-to-be."
Judges,14,19,"Then the LORD 's Spirit took control of Samson. He went to Ashkelon, where he killed thirty men and took their clothing. Samson then gave it to the thirty young men at Timnah and stormed back home to his own family."
Judges,14,20,The father of the bride made Samson's wife marry one of the thirty young men who had been at Samson's party.
Judges,15,1,"Later, during the wheat harvest, Samson went to visit the young woman he thought was still his wife. He brought along a young goat as a gift and said to her father, “I want to go into my wife's bedroom.” “You can't do that,” he replied."
Judges,15,2,"“When you left the way you did, I thought you were divorcing her. So I arranged for her to marry one of the young men who were at your party. But my younger daughter is even prettier, and you can have her as your wife.”"
Judges,15,3,"“This time,” Samson answered, “I have a good reason for really hurting some Philistines.”"
Judges,15,4,Samson went out and caught three hundred foxes and tied them together in pairs with oil-soaked rags around their tails.
Judges,15,5,"Then Samson took the foxes into the Philistine wheat fields that were ready to be harvested. He set the rags on fire and let the foxes go. The wheat fields went up in flames, and so did the stacks of wheat that had already been cut. Even the Philistine vineyards and olive orchards burnt."
Judges,15,6,"Some of the Philistines started asking around, “Who could have done such a thing?” “It was Samson,” someone told them. “He married the daughter of that man in Timnah, but then the man gave Samson's wife to one of the men at the wedding.” The Philistine leaders went to Timnah and burnt to death Samson's wife and her father."
Judges,15,7,"When Samson found out what they had done, he went to them and said, “You killed them! And I won't rest until I get even with you.”"
Judges,15,8,Then Samson started hacking them to pieces with his sword. Samson left Philistia and went to live in the cave at Etam Rock.
Judges,15,9,But it wasn't long before the Philistines invaded Judah and set up a huge army camp at Jawbone.
Judges,15,10,"The people of Judah asked, “Why have you invaded our land?” The Philistines answered, “We've come to get Samson. We're going to do the same things to him that he did to our people.”"
Judges,15,11,"Three thousand men from Judah went to the cave at Etam Rock and said to Samson, “Don't you know that the Philistines rule us, and they will punish us for what you did?” “I was only getting even with them,” Samson replied. “They did the same things to me first.”"
Judges,15,12,"“We came here to tie you up and turn you over to them,” said the men of Judah. “I won't put up a fight,” Samson answered, “but you have to promise not to hurt me yourselves.”"
Judges,16,1,"One day while Samson was in Gaza, he saw a prostitute and went to her house to spend the night."
Judges,16,2,"The people who lived in Gaza found out he was there, and they decided to kill him at sunrise. So they went to the city gate and waited all night in the guardrooms on each side of the gate."
Judges,16,3,"But Samson got up in the middle of the night and went to the town gate. He pulled the gate doors and doorposts out of the wall and put them on his shoulders. Then he carried them all the way to the top of the hill that overlooks Hebron, where he set the doors down, still closed and locked."
Judges,16,4,"Some time later, Samson fell in love with a woman named Delilah, who lived in Sorek Valley."
Judges,16,5,"The Philistine rulers went to Delilah and said, “Trick Samson into telling you what makes him so strong and what can make him weak. Then we can tie him up so he can't get away. If you find out his secret, we will each give you eleven hundred pieces of silver.”"
Judges,16,6,"The next time Samson was at Delilah's house, she asked, “Samson, what makes you so strong? How can I tie you up so you can't get away? Come on, you can tell me.”"
Judges,16,7,"Samson answered, “If someone ties me up with seven new bowstrings that have never been dried, it will make me just as weak as anyone else.”"
Judges,17,1,Micah belonged to the Ephraim tribe and lived in the hill country.
Judges,17,2,"One day he told his mother, “Do you remember those eleven hundred pieces of silver that were stolen from you? I was there when you put a curse on whoever stole them. Well, I'm the one who did it.” His mother answered, “I pray that the LORD will bless you, my son.”"
Judges,18,1,"These things happened before kings ruled Israel. About this time, the tribe of Dan was looking for a place to live. The other tribes had land, but the people of Dan did not really have any to call their own."
Judges,18,2,"The tribe chose five warriors to represent their clans and told them, “Go and find some land where we can live.” The warriors left the area of Zorah and Eshtaol and went into the hill country of Ephraim. One night they stayed at Micah's house,"
Judges,18,3,"because they heard the young Levite talking, and they knew from his accent that he was from the south. They asked him, “What are you doing here? Who brought you here?”"
Judges,18,4,"The Levite replied, “Micah hired me as his priest.” Then he told them how well Micah had treated him."
Judges,18,5,"“Please talk to God for us,” the men said. “Ask God if we will be successful in what we are trying to do.”"
Judges,18,6,"“Don't worry,” answered the priest. “The LORD is pleased with what you are doing.”"
Judges,18,7,"The five men left and went to the town of Laish, whose people were from Sidon, but Sidon was too far away to protect them. Even though their town had no walls, the people thought they were safe from attack. So they had not asked anyone else for protection, which meant that the tribe of Dan could easily take over Laish."
Judges,18,8,"The five men went back to Zorah and Eshtaol, where their relatives asked, “Did you find any land?”"
Judges,19,1,"Before kings ruled Israel, a Levite was living deep in the hill country of the Ephraim tribe. He married a woman from Bethlehem in Judah,"
Judges,19,2,but she was unfaithful and went back to live with her family in Bethlehem. Four months later
Judges,19,3,"her husband decided to try and talk her into coming back. So he went to Bethlehem, taking along a servant and two donkeys. He talked with his wife, and she invited him into her family's home. Her father was glad to see him"
Judges,19,4,"and did not want him to leave. So the man stayed three days, eating and drinking with his father-in-law."
Judges,19,5,"When everyone got up on the fourth day, the Levite started getting ready to go home. But his father-in-law said, “Don't leave until you have a bite to eat. You'll need strength for your journey.”"
Judges,19,6,"The two men sat down together and ate a big meal. “Come on,” the man's father-in-law said. “Stay tonight and have a good time.”"
Judges,19,7,"The Levite tried to leave, but his father-in-law insisted, and he spent one more night."
Judges,19,8,"On the fifth day, the man got up early to leave, but his wife's father said, “You need to keep up your strength! Why don't you leave straight after lunch?” So the two of them started eating."
Judges,19,9,"Finally, the Levite got up from the meal, so he and his wife and servant could leave. “Look,” his father-in-law said, “it's already late afternoon, and if you leave now, you won't get very far before dark. Stay with us one more night and enjoy yourself. Then you can get up early tomorrow morning and start home.”"
Judges,19,10,"But the Levite decided not to spend the night there again. He had the saddles put on his two donkeys, then he and his wife and servant travelled as far as Jebus, which is now called Jerusalem."
Judges,19,11,"It was beginning to get dark, and the man's servant said, “Let's stop and spend the night in this town where the Jebusites live.”"
Judges,19,12,"“No,” the Levite answered. “They aren't Israelites, and I refuse to spend the night there. We'll stop for the night at Gibeah,"
Judges,19,13,because we can make it to Gibeah or perhaps even to Ramah before dark.”
Judges,19,14,They walked on and reached Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin just after sunset.
Judges,19,15,"They left the road and went into Gibeah. But the Levite couldn't find a house where anyone would let them spend the night, and they sat down in the open area just inside the town gates."
Judges,19,16,"Soon an old man came in through the gates on his way home from working in the fields. Most of the people who lived in Gibeah belonged to the tribe of Benjamin, but this man was originally from the hill country of Ephraim."
Judges,19,17,He noticed that the Levite was just in town to spend the night. “Where are you going?” the old man asked. “Where did you come from?”
Judges,19,18,"“We've come from Bethlehem in Judah,” the Levite answered. “We went there on a visit. Now we're going to the place where the LORD is worshipped, and later we will return to our home in the hill country of Ephraim. But no one here will let us spend the night in their home."
Judges,19,19,"We brought food for our donkeys and bread and wine for ourselves, so we don't need anything except a place to sleep.”"
Judges,19,20,"The old man said, “You are welcome to spend the night in my home and to be my guest, but don't stay out here!”"
Judges,19,21,The old man brought them into his house and fed their donkeys. Then he and his guests washed their feet and began eating and drinking.
Judges,19,22,"They were having a good time, when some worthless men of that town surrounded the house and started banging on the door and shouting, “A man came to your house tonight. Send him out, so we can have sex with him!”"
Judges,19,23,"The old man went outside and said, “My friends, please don't commit such a horrible crime against a man who is a guest in my house."
Judges,19,24,"Let me send out my daughter instead. She's a virgin. And I'll even send out the man's wife. You can rape them or do whatever else you want, but please don't do such a horrible thing to this man.”"
Judges,19,25,"The men refused to listen, so the Levite grabbed his wife and shoved her outside. The men raped her and abused her all night long. Finally, they let her go just before sunrise,"
Judges,19,26,and it was almost daybreak when she went back to the house where her husband was staying. She collapsed at the door and lay there until sunrise.
Judges,19,27,"About that time, her husband woke up and got ready to leave. He opened the door and went outside, where he found his wife lying at the door with her hands on the doorstep."
Judges,19,28,“Get up!” he said. “It's time to leave.” But his wife didn't move. He lifted her body on to his donkey and left.
Judges,19,29,"When he got home, he took a butcher's knife and cut her body into twelve pieces. Then he told some messengers, “Take one piece to each tribe of Israel"
Judges,19,30,"and ask everyone if anything like this has ever happened since Israel left Egypt. Tell them to think about it, talk it over, and tell us what should be done.” Everyone who saw a piece of the body said, “This is horrible! Nothing like this has ever happened since the day Israel left Egypt.”"
Judges,21,1,"When the Israelites had met at Mizpah before the war with Benjamin, they had made this sacred promise: “None of us will ever let our daughters marry any man from Benjamin.”"
Judges,21,2,"After the war with Benjamin, the Israelites went to the place of worship at Bethel and sat there until sunset. They cried loudly and bitterly"
Judges,21,3,"and prayed, “Our LORD , you are the God of Israel. Why did you let this happen? Now one of our tribes is almost gone.”"
Judges,21,4,"Early the next morning, the Israelites built an altar and offered sacrifices to please the LORD and to ask his blessing."
Judges,21,5,"Then they asked each other, “Did any of the tribes of Israel fail to come to the place of worship? We made a sacred promise that anyone who didn't come to the meeting at Mizpah would be put to death.”"
Judges,21,6,"The Israelites were sad about what had happened to the Benjamin tribe, and they said, “One of our tribes was almost wiped out."
Judges,21,7,"Only a few men of Benjamin weren't killed in the war. We need to get wives for them, so the tribe won't completely disappear. But how can we do that, after promising in the LORD 's name that we wouldn't let them marry any of our daughters?”"
