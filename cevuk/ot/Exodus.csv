Exodus,2,1,"A man from the Levi tribe married a woman from the same tribe,"
Exodus,2,2,"and she later had a baby boy. He was a beautiful child, and she kept him inside for three months."
Exodus,2,3,"But when she could no longer keep him hidden, she made a basket out of reeds and covered it with tar. She put him in the basket and placed it in the tall grass along the edge of the River Nile."
Exodus,2,4,The baby's elder sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.
Exodus,2,5,"About that time one of the king's daughters came down to take a bath in the river, while her servant women walked along the river bank. She saw the basket in the tall grass and sent one of the young women to pull it out of the water."
Exodus,2,6,"When the king's daughter opened the basket, she saw the baby and felt sorry for him because he was crying. She said, “This must be one of the Hebrew babies.”"
Exodus,2,7,"At once the baby's elder sister came up and asked, “Do you want me to get a Hebrew woman to take care of the baby for you?”"
Exodus,2,8,"“Yes,” the king's daughter answered. So the girl brought the baby's mother,"
Exodus,2,9,"and the king's daughter told her, “Take care of this child, and I will pay you.” The baby's mother carried him home and took care of him."
Exodus,2,10,"And when he was old enough, she took him to the king's daughter, who adopted him. She named him Moses because she said, “I pulled him out of the water.”"
Exodus,2,11,"After Moses had grown up, he went out to where his own people were hard at work, and he saw an Egyptian beating one of them."
Exodus,2,12,"Moses looked around to see if anyone was watching, then he killed the Egyptian and hid his body in the sand."
Exodus,2,13,"When Moses went out the next day, he saw two Hebrews fighting. So he went to the man who had started the fight and asked, “Why are you beating up one of your own people?”"
Exodus,2,14,"The man answered, “Who put you in charge of us and made you our judge? Are you planning to kill me, just as you killed that Egyptian?” This frightened Moses because he was sure that people must have found out what had happened."
Exodus,2,15,"When the king heard what Moses had done, the king wanted to kill him. But Moses escaped and went to the land of Midian. One day, Moses was sitting there by a well,"
Exodus,2,16,"when the seven daughters of Jethro, the priest of Midian, came up to water their father's sheep and goats."
Exodus,2,17,"Some shepherds tried to chase them away, but Moses came to their rescue and watered their animals."
Exodus,2,18,"When Jethro's daughters returned home, their father asked, “Why have you come back so early today?”"
Exodus,2,19,"They answered, “An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds, and he even watered our sheep and goats.”"
Exodus,2,20,“Where is he?” Jethro asked. “Why did you leave him out there? Invite him to eat with us.”
Exodus,2,21,"Moses agreed to stay on with Jethro, who later let his daughter Zipporah marry Moses."
Exodus,2,22,"And when she had a son, Moses said, “I will name him Gershom, since I am a foreigner in this country.”"
Exodus,2,23,"After the death of the king of Egypt, the Israelites still complained because they were forced to be slaves. They cried out for help,"
Exodus,2,24,"and God heard their loud cries. He did not forget the promise he had made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,"
Exodus,2,25,"and because he knew what was happening to his people, he felt sorry for them."
Exodus,3,1,"One day, Moses was taking care of the sheep and goats of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian, and Moses decided to lead them across the desert to Sinai, the holy mountain."
Exodus,3,2,"There an angel of the LORD appeared to him from a burning bush. Moses saw that the bush was on fire, but it was not burning up."
Exodus,3,3,“This is strange!” he said to himself. “I'll go over and see why the bush isn't burning up.”
Exodus,3,4,"When the LORD saw Moses coming near the bush, he called him by name, and Moses answered, “Here I am.”"
Exodus,3,5,"God replied, “Don't come any closer. Take off your sandals—the ground where you are standing is holy."
Exodus,3,6,"I am the God who was worshipped by your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.” Moses was afraid to look at God, and so he hid his face."
Exodus,3,7,"The LORD said: I have seen how my people are suffering as slaves in Egypt, and I have heard them beg for my help because of the way they are being ill-treated. I feel sorry for them,"
Exodus,3,8,"and I have come down to rescue them from the Egyptians. I will bring my people out of Egypt into a country where there is good land, rich with milk and honey. I will give them the land where the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites now live."
Exodus,3,9,"My people have begged for my help, and I have seen how cruel the Egyptians are to them."
Exodus,3,10,Now go to the king! I am sending you to lead my people out of his country.
Exodus,3,11,"But Moses said, “Who am I to go to the king and lead your people out of Egypt?”"
Exodus,3,12,"God replied, “I will be with you. And you will know that I am the one who sent you, when you worship me on this mountain after you have led my people out of Egypt.”"
Exodus,3,13,"Moses answered, “I will tell the people of Israel that the God their ancestors worshipped has sent me to them. But what should I say, if they ask me your name?”"
Exodus,4,1,"Moses asked the LORD , “Suppose everyone refuses to listen to my message, and no one believes that you really appeared to me?”"
Exodus,4,2,"The LORD answered, “What's that in your hand?” “A walking stick,” Moses replied."
Exodus,4,3,"“Throw it down!” the LORD commanded. So Moses threw the stick on the ground. It immediately turned into a snake, and Moses jumped back."
Exodus,4,4,"“Pick it up by the tail!” the LORD told him. And when Moses did this, the snake turned back into a walking stick."
Exodus,4,5,"“Do this,” the LORD said, “and the Israelites will believe that you have seen me, the God who was worshipped by their ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”"
Exodus,4,6,"Next, the LORD commanded Moses, “Put your hand inside your shirt.” Moses obeyed, and when he took it out, his hand had turned white as snow—like someone with leprosy."
Exodus,4,7,"“Put your hand back inside your shirt,” the LORD told him. Moses did so, and when he took it out again, it was as healthy as the rest of his body."
Exodus,5,1,"Moses and Aaron went to the king of Egypt and told him, “The LORD God says, ‘Let my people go into the desert, so they can honour me with a celebration there.’ ”"
Exodus,5,2,“Who is this LORD and why should I obey him?” the king replied. “I refuse to let you and your people go!”
Exodus,5,3,"They answered, “The LORD God of the Hebrews, has appeared to us. Please let us walk three days into the desert where we can offer sacrifices to him. If you don't, he may strike us down with terrible troubles or with war.”"
Exodus,6,1,"The LORD God told Moses: Soon you will see what I will do to the king. Because of my mighty power, he will let my people go, and he will even chase them out of his country."
Exodus,6,2,My name is the LORD.
Exodus,6,3,"But when I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, I came as God All-Powerful and did not use my name."
Exodus,6,4,"I made an agreement and promised them the land of Canaan, where they were living as foreigners."
Exodus,6,5,"Now I have seen how the people of Israel are suffering because of the Egyptians, and I will keep my promise."
Exodus,6,6,Here is my message for Israel: “I am the LORD ! And with my mighty power I will punish the Egyptians and free you from slavery.
Exodus,6,7,"I will accept you as my people, and I will be your God. Then you will know that I was the one who rescued you from the Egyptians."
Exodus,6,8,"I will bring you into the land that I solemnly promised Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and it will be yours. I am the LORD !”"
Exodus,6,9,"When Moses told this to the Israelites, they were too discouraged and ill-treated to believe him."
Exodus,6,10,Then the LORD told Moses
Exodus,6,11,to demand that the king of Egypt let the Israelites leave.
Exodus,6,12,"But Moses replied, “I'm not a powerful speaker. If the Israelites won't listen to me, why should the king of Egypt?”"
Exodus,6,13,But the LORD sent Aaron and Moses with a message for the Israelites and for the king; he also ordered Aaron and Moses to free the people from Egypt.
Exodus,6,14,"The following men were the heads of their ancestral clans: The sons of Reuben, Jacob's eldest son, were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi."
Exodus,6,15,"The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman."
Exodus,6,16,"Levi lived to be one hundred and thirty-seven; his sons were Gershon, Kohath, and Merari."
Exodus,6,17,Gershon's sons were Libni and Shimei.
Exodus,6,18,"Kohath lived to be one hundred and thirty-three; his sons were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel."
Exodus,6,19,Merari's sons were Mahli and Mushi. All of the above were from the Levi tribe.
Exodus,6,20,"Amram lived to be one hundred and thirty-seven. He married his father's sister Jochebed, and they had two sons, Aaron and Moses."
Exodus,6,21,"Izhar's sons were Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri."
Exodus,6,22,"Uzziel's sons were Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri."
Exodus,6,23,"Aaron married Elisheba. She was the daughter of Amminadab and the sister of Nahshon; they had four sons, Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar."
Exodus,6,24,"Korah's sons were Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph."
Exodus,6,25,"Aaron's son Eleazar married one of Putiel's daughters, and their son was Phinehas. This ends the list of those who were the heads of clans in the Levi tribe."
Exodus,6,26,"The LORD had commanded Aaron and Moses to lead every family and tribe of Israel out of Egypt,"
Exodus,6,27,and so they ordered the king of Egypt to set the people of Israel free.
Exodus,6,28,"When the LORD spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,"
Exodus,6,29,"he said, “I am the LORD . Tell the king of Egypt everything I say to you.”"
Exodus,6,30,"But Moses answered, “You know I am a very poor speaker, and the king will never listen to me.”"
Exodus,7,1,"The LORD said: I am going to let your brother Aaron speak for you. He will tell your message to the king, just as a prophet speaks my message to the people."
Exodus,7,2,"Tell Aaron everything I say to you, and he will order the king to let my people leave his country."
Exodus,8,1,"he said to Moses: Go to the palace and tell the king of Egypt that I order him to let my people go, so they can worship me."
Exodus,8,2,"If he refuses, I will cover his entire country with frogs."
Exodus,8,3,"Warn the king that the Nile will be full of frogs, and from there they will spread into the royal palace, including the king's bedroom and even his bed. Frogs will enter the homes of his officials and will find their way into ovens and into the bowls of bread dough."
Exodus,8,4,"Frogs will be crawling on everyone—the king, his officials, and every citizen of Egypt."
Exodus,8,5,"Moses, now command Aaron to hold his stick over the water. Then frogs will come from all rivers, canals, and ponds in Egypt, and they will cover the land."
Exodus,8,6,"Aaron obeyed, and suddenly frogs were everywhere in Egypt."
Exodus,8,7,But the magicians used their secret powers to do the same thing.
Exodus,8,8,"The king sent for Moses and Aaron and told them, “If you ask the LORD to take these frogs away from me and my people, I will let your people go and offer sacrifices to him.”"
Exodus,8,9,"“All right,” Moses answered. “You choose the time when I am to pray for the frogs to stop bothering you, your officials, and your people, and for them to leave your houses and be found only in the river.”"
Exodus,8,10,"“Do it tomorrow!” the king replied. “As you wish,” Moses agreed. “Then everyone will discover that there is no god like the LORD,"
Exodus,8,11,"and frogs will no longer be found anywhere, except in the Nile.”"
Exodus,8,12,"After Moses and Aaron left the palace, Moses begged the LORD to do something about the frogs he had sent as punishment for the king."
Exodus,8,13,"The LORD listened to Moses, and frogs died everywhere—in houses, yards, and fields."
Exodus,8,14,"The dead frogs were placed in piles, and the whole country began to stink."
Exodus,8,15,"But when the king saw that things were now better, he again did just as the LORD had said and stubbornly refused to listen to Moses and Aaron."
Exodus,8,16,"The LORD said to Moses, “Command Aaron to strike the ground with his walking stick, and everywhere in Egypt the dust will turn into gnats.”"
Exodus,8,17,"They obeyed, and when Aaron struck the ground with the stick, gnats started swarming on people and animals. In fact, every speck of dust in Egypt turned into a gnat."
Exodus,8,18,"When the magicians tried to use their secret powers to do this, they failed, and gnats stayed on people and animals."
Exodus,8,19,"The magicians told the king, “God has done this.” But, as the LORD had said, the king was too stubborn to listen."
Exodus,8,20,"The LORD said to Moses: Early tomorrow morning, while the king is on his way to the river, go and say to him, “The LORD commands you to let his people go, so they can worship him."
Exodus,8,21,"If you don't, he will send swarms of flies to attack you, your officials, and every citizen of your country. Houses will be full of flies, and the ground will crawl with them."
Exodus,9,1,"The LORD sent Moses with this message for the king of Egypt: The LORD God of the Hebrews commands you to let his people go, so they can worship him."
Exodus,9,2,"If you keep refusing,"
Exodus,9,3,"he will bring a terrible disease on your horses and donkeys, your camels and cattle, and your sheep and goats."
Exodus,9,4,"But the LORD will protect the animals that belong to the people of Israel, and none of theirs will die."
Exodus,9,5,Tomorrow is the day the LORD has set to do this.
Exodus,9,6,"It happened the next day—all the animals belonging to the Egyptians died, but the Israelites did not lose even one."
Exodus,9,7,"When the king found out, he was still too stubborn to let the people go."
Exodus,9,8,The LORD said to Moses and Aaron: Take a few handfuls of ashes from a stove and let Moses throw them into the air. Be sure the king is watching.
Exodus,9,9,"The ashes will blow across the land of Egypt, causing sores to break out on people and animals."
Exodus,9,10,"So they took a few handfuls of ashes and went to the king. Moses threw them into the air, and sores immediately broke out on the Egyptians and their animals."
Exodus,9,11,"The magicians were suffering so much from the sores, that they could not even come to Moses."
Exodus,9,12,Everything happened just as the LORD had told Moses—he made the king too stubborn to listen to Moses and Aaron.
Exodus,9,13,"The LORD told Moses to get up early the next morning and say to the king: The LORD God of the Hebrews commands you to let his people go, so they can worship him!"
Exodus,9,14,"If you don't, he will send his worst plagues to strike you, your officials, and everyone else in your country. Then you will find out that no one can oppose the LORD."
Exodus,9,15,"In fact, he could already have sent a terrible disease and wiped you from the face of the earth."
Exodus,9,16,"But he has kept you alive, just to show you his power and to bring honour to himself everywhere in the world."
Exodus,9,17,You are still determined not to let the LORD 's people go.
Exodus,9,18,"All right. At this time tomorrow, he will bring on Egypt the worst hailstorm in its history."
Exodus,9,19,"You had better give orders for every person and every animal in Egypt to take shelter. If they don't, they will die."
Exodus,9,20,"Some of the king's officials were frightened by what the LORD had said, and they hurried off to make sure their slaves and animals were safe."
Exodus,9,21,But others paid no attention to his threats and left their slaves and animals out in the open.
Exodus,9,22,"Then the LORD told Moses, “Stretch your arm towards the sky, so that hailstones will fall on people, animals, and crops in the land of Egypt.”"
Exodus,10,1,"The LORD said to Moses: Go back to the king. I have made him and his officials stubborn, so that I could work these miracles."
Exodus,10,2,I did this because I want you to tell your children and your grandchildren about my miracles and about my harsh treatment of the Egyptians. Then all of you will know that I am the LORD.
Exodus,10,3,Moses and Aaron went to the king and told him that the LORD God of the Hebrews had said: How long will you stubbornly refuse to obey? Release my people so they can worship me.
Exodus,10,4,"Do this by tomorrow, or I will cover your country with so many locusts"
Exodus,10,5,"that you won't be able to see the ground. Most of your crops were ruined by the hailstones, but these locusts will destroy what little is left, including the trees."
Exodus,10,6,"Your palace, the homes of your officials, and all other houses in Egypt will overflow with more locusts than have ever been seen in this country. After Moses left the palace,"
Exodus,10,7,"the king's officials asked, “Your Majesty, how much longer is this man going to be a troublemaker? Why don't you let the people leave, so they can worship the LORD their God? Don't you know that Egypt is a disaster?”"
Exodus,10,8,"The king had Moses and Aaron brought back, and he said, “All right, you may go and worship the LORD your God. But first tell me who will be going.”"
Exodus,10,9,"“Everyone, young and old,” Moses answered. “We will even take our sheep, goats, and cattle, because we want to hold a celebration in honour of the LORD .”"
Exodus,10,10,"The king replied, “The LORD had better watch over you on the day I let you leave with your families! You're up to no good."
Exodus,10,11,"Do you want to worship the LORD ? All right, take only the men and go.” Then Moses and Aaron were chased out of the palace."
Exodus,10,12,"The LORD told Moses, “Stretch your arm towards Egypt. Swarms of locusts will come and eat everything left by the hail.”"
Exodus,10,13,"Moses held out his walking stick, and the LORD sent an east wind that blew across Egypt the rest of the day and all that night. By morning, locusts"
Exodus,10,14,"were swarming everywhere. Never before had there been so many locusts in Egypt, and never again will there be so many."
Exodus,10,15,"The ground was black with locusts, and they ate everything left on the trees and in the fields. Nothing green remained in Egypt—not a tree or a plant."
Exodus,10,16,"At once the king sent for Moses and Aaron. He told them, “I have sinned against the LORD your God and against you."
Exodus,10,17,Forgive me one more time and ask the LORD to stop these insects from killing every living plant.”
Exodus,10,18,Moses left the palace and prayed.
Exodus,10,19,"Then the LORD sent a strong west wind that swept the locusts into the Red Sea. Not one locust was left anywhere in Egypt,"
Exodus,10,20,but the LORD made the king so stubborn that he still refused to let the Israelites go.
Exodus,10,21,"The LORD said to Moses, “Stretch your arm towards the sky, and everything will be covered with darkness thick enough to touch.”"
Exodus,10,22,"Moses stretched his arm towards the sky, and Egypt was covered with darkness for three days."
Exodus,10,23,"During that time, the Egyptians could not see each other or leave their homes, but there was light where the Israelites lived."
Exodus,10,24,"The king sent for Moses and told him, “Go and worship the LORD ! And take your families with you. Just leave your sheep, goats, and cattle.”"
Exodus,10,25,"“No!” Moses replied. “You must let us offer sacrifices to the LORD our God,"
Exodus,10,26,and we won't know which animals we will need until we get there. That's why we can't leave even one of them here.”
Exodus,10,27,This time the LORD made the king so stubborn
Exodus,10,28,"that he said to Moses, “Get out and stay out! If you ever come back, you're dead!”"
Exodus,10,29,"“Have it your way,” Moses answered. “You won't see me again.”"
Exodus,11,1,"The LORD said to Moses: I am going to punish the king of Egypt and his people one more time. Then the king will gladly let you leave his land, so that I will stop punishing the Egyptians. He will even chase you out."
Exodus,11,2,Now go and tell my people to ask their Egyptian neighbours for gold and silver jewellery.
Exodus,11,3,"So the LORD made the Egyptians greatly respect the Israelites, and everyone, including the king and his officials, considered Moses an important leader."
Exodus,11,4,"Moses went to the king and said: I have come to let you know what the LORD is going to do. About midnight he will go through the land of Egypt,"
Exodus,11,5,"and wherever he goes, the firstborn son in every family will die. Your own son will die, and so will the son of the lowest slave woman. Even the firstborn males of cattle will die."
Exodus,11,6,Everywhere in Egypt there will be loud crying. Nothing like this has ever happened before or will ever happen again.
Exodus,11,7,"But there won't be any need for the Israelites to cry. Things will be so quiet that not even a dog will be heard barking. Then you Egyptians will know that the LORD is good to the Israelites, even while he punishes you."
Exodus,11,8,"Your leaders will come and bow down, begging me to take my people and leave your country. Then we will leave. Moses was very angry; he turned and left the king."
Exodus,11,9,"What the LORD had earlier said to Moses came true. He had said, “The king of Egypt won't listen. Then I will perform even more miracles.”"
Exodus,11,10,"So the king of Egypt saw Moses and Aaron work miracles, but the LORD made him stubbornly refuse to let the Israelites leave his country."
Exodus,12,1,Some time later the LORD said to Moses and Aaron:
Exodus,12,2,This month is to be the first month of the year for you.
Exodus,12,3,Tell the people of Israel that on the tenth day of this month the head of each family must choose a lamb or a young goat for his family to eat.
Exodus,13,1,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Exodus,13,2,“Dedicate to me the firstborn son of every family and the firstborn males of your flocks and herds. These belong to me.”
Exodus,14,1,At Etham the LORD said to Moses:
Exodus,14,2,"Tell the people of Israel to turn back and camp across from Pi-Hahiroth near Baal-Zephon, between Migdol and the Red Sea."
Exodus,14,3,"The king will think they were afraid to cross the desert and that they are wandering around, trying to find another way to leave the country."
Exodus,14,4,"I will make the king stubborn again, and he will try to catch you. Then I will destroy him and his army. People everywhere will praise me for my victory, and the Egyptians will know that I really am the LORD. The Israelites obeyed the LORD and camped where he told them."
Exodus,14,5,"When the king of Egypt heard that the Israelites had finally left, he and his officials changed their minds and said, “Look what we have done! We let them get away, and they will no longer be our slaves.”"
Exodus,14,6,The king got his war chariot and army ready.
Exodus,14,7,He commanded his officers in charge of his six hundred best chariots and all his other chariots to start after the Israelites.
Exodus,14,8,"The LORD made the king so stubborn that he went after them, even though the Israelites proudly went on their way."
Exodus,14,9,But the king's horses and chariots and soldiers caught up with them while they were camping by the Red Sea near Pi-Hahiroth and Baal-Zephon.
Exodus,14,10,"When the Israelites saw the king coming with his army, they were frightened and begged the LORD for help."
Exodus,14,11,"They also complained to Moses, “Wasn't there enough room in Egypt to bury us? Is that why you brought us out here to die in the desert? Why did you bring us out of Egypt anyway?"
Exodus,14,12,"While we were there, didn't we tell you to leave us alone? We would rather be slaves in Egypt than die in this desert!”"
Exodus,14,13,"But Moses answered, “Don't be afraid! Be brave, and you will see the LORD save you today. These Egyptians will never bother you again."
Exodus,14,14,"The LORD will fight for you, and you won't have to do a thing.”"
Exodus,14,15,"The LORD said to Moses, “Why do you keep calling out to me for help? Tell the Israelites to move forward."
Exodus,14,16,Then hold your walking stick over the sea. The water will open up and make a road where they can walk through on dry ground.
Exodus,14,17,I will make the Egyptians so stubborn that they will go after you. Then I will be praised because of what happens to the king and his chariots and cavalry.
Exodus,14,18,The Egyptians will know for sure that I am the LORD .”
Exodus,14,19,"All this time God's angel had gone ahead of Israel's army, but now he moved behind them. A large cloud had also gone ahead of them,"
Exodus,14,20,"but now it moved between the Egyptians and the Israelites. The cloud gave light to the Israelites, but made it dark for the Egyptians, and during the night they could not come any closer."
Exodus,14,21,"Moses stretched his arm over the sea, and the LORD sent a strong east wind that blew all night until there was dry land where the water had been. The sea opened up,"
Exodus,14,22,and the Israelites walked through on dry land with a wall of water on each side.
Exodus,14,23,The Egyptian chariots and cavalry went after them.
Exodus,14,24,But before daylight the LORD looked down at the Egyptian army from the fiery cloud and made them panic.
Exodus,14,25,"Their chariot wheels got stuck, and it was hard for them to move. So the Egyptians said to one another, “Let's leave these people alone! The LORD is on their side and is fighting against us.”"
Exodus,14,26,"The LORD told Moses, “Stretch your arm towards the sea—the water will cover the Egyptians and their cavalry and chariots.”"
Exodus,14,27,"Moses stretched out his arm, and at daybreak the water rushed towards the Egyptians. They tried to run away, but the LORD drowned them in the sea."
Exodus,14,28,"The water came and covered the chariots, the cavalry, and the whole Egyptian army that had followed the Israelites into the sea. Not one of them was left alive."
Exodus,14,29,But the sea had made a wall of water on each side of the Israelites; so they walked through on dry land.
Exodus,14,30,"On that day, when the Israelites saw the bodies of the Egyptians washed up on the shore, they knew that the LORD had saved them."
Exodus,14,31,"Because of the mighty power he had used against the Egyptians, the Israelites worshipped him and trusted him and his servant Moses."
Exodus,15,1,Moses and the Israelites sang this song in praise of the LORD: I sing praises to the LORD for his great victory! He has thrown the horses and their riders into the sea.
Exodus,15,2,"The LORD is my strength, the reason for my song, because he has saved me. I praise and honour the LORD — he is my God and the God of my ancestors."
Exodus,15,3,"The LORD is his name, and he is a warrior!"
Exodus,15,4,"He threw the chariots and army of Egypt's king into the Red Sea, and he drowned the best of the king's officers."
Exodus,15,5,They sank to the bottom just like stones.
Exodus,15,6,"With the tremendous force of your right arm, our LORD, you crushed your enemies."
Exodus,15,7,"What a great victory was yours, as you defeated everyone who opposed you. Your fiery anger wiped them out, as though they were straw."
Exodus,15,8,"You were so furious that the sea piled up like a wall, and the ocean depths curdled like cheese."
Exodus,15,9,"Your enemies boasted that they would pursue and capture us, divide up our possessions, treat us as they wished, then take out their swords and kill us there."
Exodus,15,10,"But when you got furious, they sank like lead, swallowed by ocean waves."
Exodus,15,11,"Our LORD , no other gods compare with you— Majestic and holy! Fearsome and glorious! Miracle worker!"
Exodus,15,12,"When you signalled with your right hand, your enemies were swallowed deep into the earth."
Exodus,15,13,The people you rescued were led by your powerful love to your holy place.
Exodus,15,14,Nations learnt of this and trembled— Philistines shook with horror.
Exodus,15,15,"The leaders of Edom and of Moab were terrified. Everyone in Canaan fainted,"
Exodus,15,16,"struck down by fear. Our LORD , your powerful arm kept them still as a rock until the people you rescued for your very own had marched by."
Exodus,15,17,"You will let your people settle on your chosen mountain, where you built your home and your temple."
Exodus,15,18,"Our LORD , you will rule for ever!"
Exodus,15,19,"The LORD covered the royal Egyptian cavalry and chariots with the sea, after the Israelites had walked safely through on dry ground."
Exodus,15,20,Miriam the sister of Aaron was a prophet. So she took her tambourine and led the other women out to play their tambourines and to dance.
Exodus,15,21,Then she sang to them: “Sing praises to the LORD for his great victory! He has thrown the horses and their riders into the sea.”
Exodus,15,22,"After the Israelites left the Red Sea, Moses led them through the Shur Desert for three days, before finding water."
Exodus,15,23,"They did find water at Marah, but it was bitter, which is how that place got its name."
Exodus,15,24,"The people complained and said, “Moses, what are we going to drink?”"
Exodus,15,25,"Moses asked the LORD for help, and the LORD told him to throw a piece of wood into the water. Moses did so, and the water became fit to drink. At Marah the LORD tested his people and also gave them some laws and teachings."
Exodus,15,26,"Then he said, “I am the LORD your God, and I cure your diseases. If you obey me by doing right and by following my laws and teachings, I won't punish you with the diseases I sent on the Egyptians.”"
Exodus,15,27,"Later the Israelites came to Elim, where there were twelve springs and seventy palm trees. So they camped there."
Exodus,16,1,"On the fifteenth day of the second month after the Israelites had escaped from Egypt, they left Elim and started through the western edge of the Sinai Desert in the direction of Mount Sinai."
Exodus,16,2,"There in the desert they started complaining to Moses and Aaron,"
Exodus,16,3,"“We wish the LORD had killed us in Egypt. When we lived there, we could at least sit down and eat all the bread and meat we wanted. But you have brought us out here into this desert, where we are going to starve.”"
Exodus,16,4,"The LORD said to Moses, “I will send bread down from heaven like rain. Each day the people can go out and gather only enough for that day. That's how I will see if they obey me."
Exodus,16,5,But on the sixth day of each week they must gather and cook twice as much.”
Exodus,16,6,"Moses and Aaron told the people, “This evening you will know that the LORD was the one who rescued you from Egypt."
Exodus,16,7,"And in the morning you will see his glorious power, because he has heard your complaints against him. Why should you grumble to us? Who are we?”"
Exodus,16,8,"Then Moses continued, “You will know it is the LORD when he gives you meat each evening and more than enough bread each morning. He is really the one you are complaining about, not us—we are nobodies—but the LORD has heard your complaints.”"
Exodus,16,9,"Moses turned to Aaron and said, “Bring the people together, because the LORD has heard their complaints.”"
Exodus,16,10,"Aaron was speaking to them, when everyone looked out towards the desert and saw the bright glory of the LORD in a cloud."
Exodus,16,11,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Exodus,16,12,“I have heard my people complain. Now tell them that each evening they will have meat and each morning they will have more than enough bread. Then they will know that I am the LORD their God.”
Exodus,16,13,"That evening a lot of quails came and landed everywhere in the camp, and the next morning dew covered the ground."
Exodus,16,14,"After the dew had gone, the desert was covered with thin flakes that looked like frost."
Exodus,16,15,"The people had never seen anything like this, and they started asking each other, “What is it?” Moses answered, “This is the bread that the LORD has given you to eat."
Exodus,16,16,And he orders you to gather about two litres for each person in your family—that should be more than enough.”
Exodus,16,17,"They did as they were told. Some gathered more and some gathered less,"
Exodus,16,18,"according to their needs, and none was left over."
Exodus,16,19,Moses told them not to keep any overnight.
Exodus,16,20,"Some of them disobeyed, but the next morning what they kept was stinking and full of worms, and Moses was angry."
Exodus,16,21,"Each morning everyone gathered as much as they needed, and in the heat of the day the rest melted."
Exodus,16,22,"However, on the sixth day of the week, everyone gathered enough to have four litres, instead of two. When the leaders reported this to Moses,"
Exodus,16,23,"he told them that the LORD had said, “Tomorrow is the Sabbath, a sacred day of rest in honour of me. So gather all you want to bake or boil, and make sure you save enough for tomorrow.”"
Exodus,16,24,"The people obeyed, and the next morning the food smelt fine and had no worms."
Exodus,16,25,"“You may eat the food,” Moses said. “Today is the Sabbath in honour of the LORD , and there won't be any of this food on the ground today."
Exodus,16,26,"You will find it there for the first six days of the week, but not on the Sabbath.”"
Exodus,16,27,"A few of the Israelites did go out to look for some, but there was none."
Exodus,16,28,"Then the LORD said, “Moses, how long will you people keep disobeying my laws and teachings?"
Exodus,16,29,Remember that I was the one who gave you the Sabbath. That's why on the sixth day I provide enough bread for two days. Everyone is to stay at home and rest on the Sabbath.”
Exodus,16,30,And so they rested on the Sabbath.
Exodus,16,31,The Israelites called the bread manna. It was white like coriander seed and delicious as wafers made with honey.
Exodus,16,32,"Moses told the people that the LORD had said, “Store up two litres of this manna, because I want future generations to see the food I gave you during the time you were in the desert after I rescued you from Egypt.”"
Exodus,16,33,"Then Moses told Aaron, “Put some manna in a jar and store it in the place of worship for future generations to see.”"
Exodus,16,34,Aaron followed the LORD 's instructions and put the manna in front of the sacred chest for safekeeping.
Exodus,17,1,"The Israelites left the desert and moved from one place to another each time the LORD ordered them to. Once they camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for them to drink."
Exodus,17,2,"The people started complaining to Moses, “Give us some water!” Moses replied, “Why are you complaining to me and trying to put the LORD to the test?”"
Exodus,17,3,"But the people were thirsty and kept on complaining, “Moses, did you bring us out of Egypt just to let us and our families and our animals die of thirst?”"
Exodus,17,4,"Then Moses prayed to the LORD , “What am I going to do with these people? They are about to stone me to death!”"
Exodus,17,5,"The LORD answered, “Take some of the leaders with you and go ahead of the rest of the people. Also take along the walking stick you used to strike the River Nile,"
Exodus,17,6,"and when you get to the rock at Mount Sinai, I will be there with you. Strike the rock with the stick, and water will pour out for the people to drink.” Moses did this while the leaders watched."
Exodus,17,7,"The people had complained and tested the LORD by asking, “Is the LORD really with us?” So Moses named that place Massah, which means “testing” and Meribah, which means “complaining”."
Exodus,17,8,"When the Israelites were at Rephidim, they were attacked by the Amalekites."
Exodus,17,9,"So Moses told Joshua, “Have some men ready to attack the Amalekites tomorrow. I will stand on a hilltop, holding this walking stick that has the power of God.”"
Exodus,17,10,"Joshua led the attack as Moses had commanded, while Moses, Aaron, and Hur stood on the hilltop."
Exodus,17,11,"The Israelites out-fought the Amalekites as long as Moses held up his arms, but they started losing whenever he had to lower them."
Exodus,17,12,"Finally, Moses was so tired that Aaron and Hur got a rock for him to sit on. Then they stood beside him and supported his arms in the same position until sunset."
Exodus,17,13,That's how Joshua defeated the Amalekites.
Exodus,17,14,"Afterwards, the LORD said to Moses, “Write an account of this victory and read it to Joshua. I want the Amalekites to be forgotten for ever.”"
Exodus,17,15,Moses built an altar and named it “The LORD Gives me Victory”.
Exodus,17,16,"Then Moses explained, “This is because I depended on the LORD. But in future generations, the LORD will have to fight the Amalekites again.”"
Exodus,18,1,"Jethro was the priest of Midian and the father-in-law of Moses. And he heard what the LORD God had done for Moses and his people, after rescuing them from Egypt."
Exodus,20,1,God said to the people of Israel:
Exodus,20,2,"I am the LORD your God, the one who brought you out of Egypt where you were slaves."
Exodus,20,3,Do not worship any god except me.
Exodus,20,4,Do not make idols that look like anything in the sky or on earth or in the sea under the earth.
Exodus,20,5,"Don't bow down and worship idols. I am the LORD your God, and I demand all your love. If you reject me, I will punish your families for three or four generations."
Exodus,20,6,"But if you love me and obey my laws, I will be kind to your families for thousands of generations."
Exodus,20,7,"Do not misuse my name. I am the LORD your God, and I will punish anyone who misuses my name."
Exodus,20,8,Remember that the Sabbath Day belongs to me.
Exodus,20,9,"You have six days when you can do your work,"
Exodus,20,10,"but the seventh day of each week belongs to me, your God. No one is to work on that day—not you, your children, your slaves, your animals, or the foreigners who live in your towns."
Exodus,20,11,"In six days I made the sky, the earth, the seas, and everything in them, but on the seventh day I rested. That's why I made the Sabbath a special day that belongs to me."
Exodus,20,12,"Respect your father and your mother, and you will live a long time in the land I am giving you."
Exodus,20,13,Do not murder.
Exodus,20,14,Be faithful in marriage.
Exodus,20,15,Do not steal.
Exodus,20,16,Do not tell lies about others.
Exodus,20,17,"Do not want to take anything that belongs to someone else. Don't want to take anyone's house, wife or husband, slaves, oxen, donkeys or anything else."
Exodus,20,18,The people trembled with fear when they heard the thunder and the trumpet and saw the lightning and the smoke coming from the mountain. They stood a long way off
Exodus,20,19,"and said to Moses, “If you speak to us, we will listen. But don't let God speak to us, or we will die!”"
Exodus,20,20,"“Don't be afraid!” Moses replied. “God has come only to test you, so that by obeying him you won't sin.”"
Exodus,20,21,"But when Moses went near the thick cloud where God was, the people stayed a long way off."
Exodus,20,22,"The LORD told Moses to say to the people of Israel: With your own eyes, you saw me speak to you from heaven."
Exodus,20,23,So you must never make idols of silver or gold to worship in place of me.
Exodus,20,24,"Build an altar out of earth, and offer on it your sacrifices of sheep, goats, and cattle. Wherever I choose to be worshipped, I will come down to bless you."
Exodus,20,25,"If you ever build an altar for me out of stones, do not use any tools to chisel the stones, because that would make the altar unfit."
Exodus,20,26,And don't build an altar that requires steps; you might expose yourself when you climb up.
Exodus,21,1,The LORD gave Moses the following laws for his people:
Exodus,21,2,"If you buy a Hebrew slave, he must remain your slave for six years. But in the seventh year you must set him free, without cost to him."
Exodus,21,3,"If he was single at the time you bought him, he alone must be set free. But if he was married at the time, both he and his wife must be given their freedom."
Exodus,21,4,"If you give him a wife, and they have children, only the man himself must be set free; his wife and children remain the property of his owner."
Exodus,21,5,But suppose the slave loves his wife and children so much that he won't leave without them.
Exodus,21,6,"Then he must stand beside either the door or the doorpost at the place of worship, while his owner punches a small hole through one of his ears with a sharp metal rod. This makes him a slave for life."
Exodus,21,7,A young woman who was sold by her father doesn't gain her freedom in the same way that a man does.
Exodus,21,8,"If she doesn't please the man who bought her to be his wife, he must let her be bought back. He cannot sell her to foreigners; this would break the contract he made with her."
Exodus,21,9,"If he selects her as a wife for his son, he must treat her as his own daughter."
Exodus,21,10,"If the man later marries another woman, he must continue to provide food and clothing for the one he bought and to treat her as a wife."
Exodus,21,11,"If he fails to do any of these things, she must be given her freedom without cost."
Exodus,21,12,Death is the punishment for murder.
Exodus,21,13,"But if you did not intend to kill someone, and I, the LORD , let it happen anyway, you may run for safety to a place that I have set aside."
Exodus,21,14,"If you plan in advance to murder someone, there's no escape, not even by holding on to my altar. You will be dragged off and killed."
Exodus,21,15,Death is the punishment for attacking your father or mother.
Exodus,21,16,"Death is the punishment for kidnapping. If you sell the person you kidnapped, or if you are caught with that person, the penalty is death."
Exodus,21,17,Death is the punishment for cursing your father or mother.
Exodus,21,18,"Suppose two of you are arguing, and you hit the other with either a rock or your fist, without causing a fatal injury. If the victim has to stay in bed,"
Exodus,21,19,"and later has to use a stick when walking outside, you must pay for the loss of time and do what you can to help until the injury is completely healed. That's your only responsibility."
Exodus,21,20,Death is the punishment for beating to death any of your slaves.
Exodus,21,21,"However, if the slave lives a few days after the beating, you are not to be punished. After all, you have already lost the services of that slave who was your property."
Exodus,21,22,"Suppose a pregnant woman suffers a miscarriage as the result of an injury caused by someone who is fighting. If she isn't badly hurt, the one who injured her must pay whatever fine her husband demands and the judges approve."
Exodus,21,23,"But if she is seriously injured, the payment will be life for life,"
Exodus,21,24,"eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,"
Exodus,21,25,"burn for burn, cut for cut, and bruise for bruise."
Exodus,21,26,"If you hit one of your slaves and cause the loss of an eye, the slave must be set free."
Exodus,21,27,The same law applies if you knock out a slave's tooth—the slave goes free.
Exodus,21,28,"A bull that kills someone with its horns must be killed and its meat destroyed, but the owner of the bull isn't responsible for the death."
Exodus,21,29,"Suppose you own a bull that has been in the habit of attacking people, but you have refused to keep it fenced in. If that bull kills someone, both you and the bull must be put to death by stoning."
Exodus,21,30,"However, you may save your own life by paying whatever fine is demanded."
Exodus,21,31,This same law applies if the bull gores someone's son or daughter.
Exodus,21,32,"If the bull kills a slave, you must pay the slave owner thirty pieces of silver for the loss of the slave, and the bull must be killed by stoning."
Exodus,21,33,Suppose someone's ox or donkey is killed by falling into an open pit that you dug or left uncovered on your property.
Exodus,21,34,"You must pay for the dead animal, and it becomes yours."
Exodus,21,35,"If your bull kills someone else's, yours must be sold. Then the money from your bull and the meat from the dead bull must be divided equally between you and the other owner."
Exodus,21,36,"If you refuse to fence in a bull that is known to attack others, you must pay for any animal it kills, but the dead animal will belong to you."
Exodus,22,1,"If you steal an ox and slaughter or sell it, you must replace it with five oxen; if you steal a sheep and slaughter it or sell it, you must replace it with four sheep."
Exodus,23,1,Don't spread harmful rumours or help a criminal by giving false evidence.
Exodus,23,2,"Always tell the truth in court, even if everyone else is dishonest and stands in the way of justice."
Exodus,23,3,"And don't favour the poor, simply because they are poor."
Exodus,23,4,"If you find an ox or a donkey that has wandered off, take it back where it belongs, even if the owner is your enemy."
Exodus,23,5,"If a donkey is overloaded and falls down, you must do what you can to help, even if it belongs to someone who doesn't like you."
Exodus,23,6,Make sure that the poor are given equal justice in court.
Exodus,23,7,Don't bring false charges against anyone or sentence an innocent person to death. I won't forgive you if you do.
Exodus,23,8,Don't accept bribes. Judges are blinded and justice is twisted by bribes.
Exodus,23,9,"Don't ill-treat foreigners. You were foreigners in Egypt, and you know what it is like."
Exodus,23,10,"Plant and harvest your crops for six years,"
Exodus,23,11,"but let the land rest during the seventh year. The poor are to eat what they want from your fields, vineyards, and olive trees during that year, and when they have all they want from your fields, leave the rest for wild animals."
Exodus,23,12,"Work the first six days of the week, but rest and relax on the seventh day. This law is not only for you, but for your oxen, donkeys, and slaves, as well as for any foreigners among you."
Exodus,23,13,Make certain that you obey everything I have said. Don't pray to other gods or even mention their names.
Exodus,23,14,Celebrate three festivals each year in my honour.
Exodus,23,15,"Celebrate the Festival of Thin Bread by eating bread made without yeast, just as I have commanded. Do this at the proper time during the month of Abib, because it is the month when you left Egypt. And make certain that everyone brings the proper offerings."
Exodus,23,16,"Celebrate the Harvest Festival each spring when you start harvesting your wheat, and celebrate the Festival of Shelters each autumn when you pick your fruit."
Exodus,23,17,Your men must come to these three festivals each year to worship me.
Exodus,23,18,Do not offer bread made with yeast when you sacrifice an animal to me. And make sure that the fat of the animal is burnt that same day.
Exodus,23,19,Each year bring the best part of your first harvest to the place of worship. Don't boil a young goat in its mother's milk.
Exodus,23,20,I am sending an angel to protect you and to lead you into the land I have ready for you.
Exodus,23,21,"Carefully obey everything the angel says, because I am giving him complete authority, and he won't tolerate rebellion."
Exodus,23,22,"If you faithfully obey him, I will be a fierce enemy of your enemies."
Exodus,23,23,"My angel will lead you into the land of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hivites, and Jebusites, and I will wipe them out."
Exodus,23,24,"Don't worship their gods or follow their customs. Instead, destroy their idols and shatter their stone images."
Exodus,23,25,"Worship only me, the LORD your God! I will bless you with plenty of food and water and keep you strong."
Exodus,23,26,"Your women will give birth to healthy children, and everyone will live a long life."
Exodus,23,27,I will terrify those nations and make your enemies so confused that they will run from you.
Exodus,23,28,"I will make the Hivites, Canaanites, and Hittites panic as you approach."
Exodus,23,29,"But I won't do all this in the first year, because the land would become poor, and wild animals would be everywhere."
Exodus,23,30,"Instead, I will force out your enemies little by little and give your nation time to grow strong enough to take over the land."
Exodus,23,31,"I will see that your borders reach from the Red Sea to the River Euphrates and from the Mediterranean Sea to the desert. I will let you defeat the people who live there, and you will force them out of the land."
Exodus,23,32,But you must not make any agreements with them or with their gods.
Exodus,23,33,Don't let them stay in your land. They will trap you into sinning against me and worshipping their gods.
Exodus,24,1,"The LORD said to Moses, “Come up to me on this mountain. Bring along Aaron, as well as his two sons Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of Israel's leaders. They must worship me at a distance,"
Exodus,24,2,but you are to come near. Don't let anyone else come up.”
Exodus,24,3,"Moses gave the LORD 's instructions to the people, and they promised, “We will do everything the LORD has commanded!”"
Exodus,24,4,Then Moses wrote down what the LORD had said. The next morning Moses got up early. He built an altar at the foot of the mountain and set up a large stone for each of the twelve tribes of Israel.
Exodus,24,5,He also sent some young men to burn offerings and to sacrifice bulls as special offerings to the LORD.
Exodus,24,6,Moses put half of the blood from the animals into bowls and sprinkled the rest on the altar.
Exodus,24,7,"Then he read aloud the LORD 's commands and promises, and the people shouted, “We will obey the LORD and do everything he has commanded!”"
Exodus,24,8,"Moses took the blood from the bowls and sprinkled it on the people. Next, he told them, “With this blood the LORD makes his agreement with you.”"
Exodus,24,9,"Moses and Aaron, together with Nadab and Abihu and the seventy leaders, went up the mountain"
Exodus,24,10,"and saw the God of Israel. Under his feet was something that looked like a pavement made out of sapphire, and it was as bright as the sky."
Exodus,24,11,"Even though these leaders of Israel saw God, he did not punish them. So they ate and drank."
Exodus,24,12,"The LORD said to Moses, “Come up on the mountain and stay here for a while. I will give you the two flat stones on which I have written the laws that my people must obey.”"
Exodus,24,13,"Moses and Joshua his assistant got ready, then Moses started up the mountain to meet with God."
Exodus,24,14,"Moses had told the leaders, “Wait here until we come back. Aaron and Hur will be with you, and they can settle any arguments while we are away.”"
Exodus,24,15,"When Moses went up on Mount Sinai, a cloud covered it,"
Exodus,24,16,"and the bright glory of the LORD came down and stayed there. The cloud covered the mountain for six days, and on the seventh day the LORD told Moses to come into the cloud."
Exodus,25,1,The LORD said to Moses:
Exodus,25,2,Tell everyone in Israel who wants to give gifts that they must bring them to you.
Exodus,25,3,"Here is a list of what you are to collect: gold, silver, and bronze;"
Exodus,25,4,"blue, purple, and red wool; fine linen; goat hair;"
Exodus,25,5,tanned ram skins; fine leather; acacia wood;
Exodus,25,6,olive oil for the lamp; sweet-smelling spices to mix with the oil for dedicating the tent and ordaining the priests;
Exodus,25,7,and onyx stones for the sacred apron and the breastpiece.
Exodus,25,8,I also want them to build a special place where I can live among my people.
Exodus,25,9,Make it and its furnishings exactly like the pattern I will show you.
Exodus,25,10,"Tell the people to build a chest of acacia wood one hundred and ten centimetres long, sixty-six centimetres wide, and sixty-six centimetres high."
Exodus,25,11,Cover it inside and out with pure gold and put a gold edging around the lid.
Exodus,25,12,Make four gold rings and fasten one of them to each of the four legs of the chest.
Exodus,25,13,Make two poles of acacia wood. Cover them with gold
Exodus,25,14,"and put them through the rings, so the chest can be carried by the poles."
Exodus,25,15,Don't ever remove the poles from the rings.
Exodus,25,16,"When I give you the Ten Commandments written on two flat stones, put them inside the chest."
Exodus,25,17,Cover the lid of the chest with pure gold.
Exodus,26,1,"Furnish the sacred tent with curtains made from ten pieces of the finest linen. They must be woven with blue, purple, and red wool and embroidered with figures of winged creatures."
Exodus,26,2,Make each piece twelve metres long and two metres wide
Exodus,26,3,and sew them together into two curtains with five sections each.
Exodus,27,1,"Use acacia wood to build an altar two and a quarter metres square and one and a third metres high,"
Exodus,27,2,"and make each of the four top corners stick up like the horn of a bull. Then cover the whole altar with bronze, including the four horns."
Exodus,27,3,"All the equipment for the altar must also be made of bronze—the pans for the hot ashes, the shovels, the sprinkling bowls, the meat forks, and the fire pans."
Exodus,28,1,"Send for your brother Aaron and his sons Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. They are the ones I have chosen from Israel to serve as my priests."
Exodus,28,2,Make Aaron some beautiful clothes that are worthy of a high priest.
Exodus,28,3,"Aaron is to be dedicated as my high priest, and his clothes must be made only by persons who possess skills that I have given them."
Exodus,28,4,"Here are the items that need to be made: a breastpiece, a priestly apron, a robe, an embroidered shirt, a turban, and a sash. These sacred clothes are to be made for your brother Aaron and his sons who will be my priests."
Exodus,28,5,"Only gold and fine linen, woven with blue, purple, and red wool, are to be used for making these clothes."
Exodus,29,1,"When you ordain one of Aaron's sons as my priest, choose a young bull and two rams that have nothing wrong with them."
Exodus,29,2,"Then from your finest flour make three batches of dough without yeast. Shape some of it into larger loaves, some into smaller loaves mixed with olive oil, and the rest into thin wafers brushed with oil."
Exodus,29,3,Put all this bread in a basket and bring it when you come to sacrifice the three animals to me.
Exodus,29,4,Bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the sacred tent and make them wash themselves.
Exodus,29,5,"Dress Aaron in the priestly shirt, the robe that goes under the sacred apron, the apron itself, the breastpiece, and the sash."
Exodus,29,6,Put on his turban with its narrow strip of engraved gold
Exodus,29,7,and then ordain him by pouring olive oil on his head.
Exodus,29,8,"Next, dress Aaron's sons in their special shirts"
Exodus,29,9,"and caps and their sashes, then ordain them, because they and their descendants will always be priests."
Exodus,29,10,"Lead the bull to the entrance of the sacred tent, where Aaron and his sons will lay their hands on its head."
Exodus,29,11,Kill the bull near my altar in front of the tent.
Exodus,29,12,Use a finger to smear some of its blood on each of the four corners of the altar and pour out the rest of the blood on the ground next to the altar.
Exodus,29,13,"Then take the fat from the animal's insides, as well as the lower part of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat, and send them up in smoke on the altar."
Exodus,29,14,"But the meat, the skin, and the food still in the bull's stomach must be burnt outside the camp as an offering to ask forgiveness for the sins of the priests."
Exodus,29,15,Bring one of the rams to Aaron and his sons and make them lay their hands on its head.
Exodus,29,16,Kill the ram and splatter its blood against all four sides of the altar.
Exodus,29,17,"Cut up the ram, wash its insides and legs, and lay all its parts on the altar, including the head."
Exodus,29,18,Then make sure that the whole animal goes up in smoke with a smell that pleases me.
Exodus,29,19,Bring the other ram to Aaron and his sons and make them lay their hands on its head.
Exodus,29,20,"Kill the ram and place some of its blood on Aaron's right ear lobe, his right thumb, and the big toe of his right foot. Do the same for each of his sons and splatter the rest of the blood against the four sides of the altar."
Exodus,29,21,"Then take some of the blood from the altar, mix it with the oil used for ordination, and sprinkle it on Aaron and his clothes, and also on his sons and their clothes. This will show that they and their clothes have been dedicated to me."
Exodus,29,22,"This ram is part of the ordination service. So remove its right hind leg, its fat tail, the fat on its insides, as well as the lower part of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat."
Exodus,29,23,"Take one loaf of each kind of bread from the basket,"
Exodus,29,24,"and put this bread, together with the meat, into the hands of Aaron and his sons. Then they will lift it all up to show that it is dedicated to me."
Exodus,29,25,"After this, the meat and bread are to be placed on the altar and sent up in smoke with a smell that pleases me."
Exodus,29,26,"You may eat the choice ribs from this second ram, but you must first lift them up to show that this meat is dedicated to me."
Exodus,30,1,Build an altar of acacia wood where you can burn incense.
Exodus,30,2,"Make it forty-five centimetres square and ninety centimetres high, and make each of its four corners stick up like the horn of a bull."
Exodus,30,3,Cover it with pure gold and put a gold edging around it.
Exodus,30,4,Then below the edging on opposite sides attach two gold rings through which you can put the poles for carrying the altar.
Exodus,30,5,These poles are also to be made of acacia wood covered with gold.
Exodus,30,6,"Put the altar in front of the inside curtain of the sacred tent. The chest with the place of mercy is kept behind that curtain, and I will talk with you there."
Exodus,31,1,The LORD said to Moses:
Exodus,31,2,I have chosen Bezalel from the Judah tribe to make the sacred tent and its furnishings.
Exodus,32,1,"After the people saw that Moses had been on the mountain for a long time, they went to Aaron and said, “Make us an image of a god who will lead and protect us. Moses brought us out of Egypt, but nobody knows what has happened to him.”"
Exodus,32,2,"Aaron told them, “Bring me the gold earrings that your wives and sons and daughters are wearing.”"
Exodus,32,3,"Everybody took off their earrings and brought them to Aaron,"
Exodus,32,4,"then he melted them and made an idol in the shape of a young bull. All the people said to one another, “This is the god who brought us out of Egypt!”"
Exodus,32,5,"When Aaron saw what was happening, he built an altar in front of the idol and said, “Tomorrow we will celebrate in honour of the LORD .”"
Exodus,32,6,The people got up early the next morning and killed some animals to be used for sacrifices and others to be eaten. Then everyone ate and drank so much that they began to carry on like wild people.
Exodus,32,7,The LORD said to Moses: Hurry back down! Those people you led out of Egypt are acting like fools.
Exodus,32,8,"They have already stopped obeying me and have made themselves an idol in the shape of a young bull. They have bowed down to it, offered sacrifices, and said that it is the god who brought them out of Egypt."
Exodus,32,9,"Moses, I have seen how stubborn these people are,"
Exodus,32,10,"and I'm angry enough to destroy them, so don't try to stop me. But I will make your descendants into a great nation."
Exodus,32,11,"Moses tried to get the LORD God to change his mind: Our LORD , you used your mighty power to bring these people out of Egypt. Now don't become angry and destroy them."
Exodus,32,12,"If you do, the Egyptians will say that you brought your people out here into the mountains just to get rid of them. Please don't be angry with your people. Don't destroy them!"
Exodus,32,13,"Remember the solemn promise you made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. You promised that some day they would have as many descendants as there are stars in the sky and that you would give them land."
Exodus,32,14,"So even though the LORD had threatened to destroy the people, he changed his mind and let them live."
Exodus,33,1,"The LORD said to Moses: You led the people of Israel out of Egypt. Now get ready to lead them to the land I promised their ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."
Exodus,34,1,"One day the LORD said to Moses, “Cut two flat stones like the first ones I made, and I will write on them the same commandments that were on the two you broke."
Exodus,34,2,Be ready tomorrow morning to come up Mount Sinai and meet me at the top.
Exodus,34,3,No one is to come with you or to be on the mountain at all. Don't even let the sheep and cattle graze at the foot of the mountain.”
Exodus,34,4,"So Moses cut two flat stones like the first ones, and early the next morning he carried them to the top of Mount Sinai, just as the LORD had commanded."
Exodus,34,5,"The LORD God came down in a cloud and stood beside Moses there on the mountain. God spoke his holy name, “the LORD ”."
Exodus,34,6,"Then he passed in front of Moses and called out, “I am the LORD God. I am merciful and very patient with my people. I show great love, and I can be trusted."
Exodus,34,7,"I keep my promises to my people for ever, but I also punish anyone who sins. When people sin, I punish them and their children, and also their grandchildren and great-grandchildren.”"
Exodus,34,8,Moses quickly bowed down to the ground and worshipped the LORD.
Exodus,34,9,"He prayed, “ LORD , if you really are pleased with me, I pray that you will go with us. It is true that these people are sinful and rebellious, but forgive our sin and let us be your people.”"
Exodus,34,10,The LORD said: I promise to perform miracles for you that have never been seen anywhere on earth. Neighbouring nations will stand in fear and know that I was the one who did these marvellous things.
Exodus,34,11,"I will force out the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, but you must do what I command you today."
Exodus,34,12,"Don't make treaties with any of those people. If you do, it will be like falling into a trap."
Exodus,34,13,"Instead, you must destroy their altars and tear down the sacred poles they use in the worship of the goddess Asherah."
Exodus,34,14,I demand your complete loyalty—you must not worship any other god!
Exodus,34,15,"Don't make treaties with the people there, or you will soon find yourselves worshipping their gods and taking part in their sacrificial meals."
Exodus,34,16,Your men will even marry their women and be influenced to worship their gods.
Exodus,34,17,Don't make metal images of gods.
Exodus,34,18,"Don't fail to observe the Festival of Thin Bread in the month of Abib. Obey me and eat bread without yeast for seven days during Abib, because that is the month you left Egypt."
Exodus,34,19,The firstborn males of your families and of your flocks and herds belong to me.
Exodus,34,20,"You can save the life of a firstborn donkey by sacrificing a lamb; if you don't, you must break the donkey's neck. You must save every firstborn son. Bring an offering every time you come to worship."
Exodus,34,21,"Do your work in six days and rest on the seventh day, even during the seasons for ploughing and harvesting."
Exodus,34,22,"Celebrate the Harvest Festival each spring when you start harvesting your wheat, and celebrate the Festival of Shelters each autumn when you pick your fruit."
Exodus,34,23,"Your men must come to worship me three times a year, because I am the LORD God of Israel."
Exodus,34,24,I will force the nations out of your land and enlarge your borders. Then no one will try to take your property when you come to worship me these three times each year.
Exodus,34,25,"When you sacrifice an animal on the altar, don't offer bread made with yeast. And don't save any part of the Passover meal for the next day."
Exodus,34,26,"I am the LORD your God, and you must bring the first part of your harvest to the place of worship. Don't boil a young goat in its mother's milk."
Exodus,34,27,"The LORD told Moses to put these laws in writing, as part of his agreement with Israel."
Exodus,34,28,"Moses stayed on the mountain with the LORD for forty days and nights, without eating or drinking. And he wrote down the Ten Commandments, the most important part of God's agreement with his people."
Exodus,34,29,"Moses came down from Mount Sinai, carrying the Ten Commandments. His face was shining brightly because the LORD had been speaking to him. But Moses did not know at first that his face was shining."
Exodus,34,30,"When Aaron and the others looked at Moses, they saw that his face was shining, and they were afraid to go near him."
Exodus,34,31,"Moses called out for Aaron and the leaders to come to him, and he spoke with them."
Exodus,34,32,"Then the rest of the people of Israel gathered around Moses, and he gave them the laws that the LORD had given him on Mount Sinai."
Exodus,34,33,"The face of Moses kept shining, and after he had spoken with the people, he covered his face with a veil."
Exodus,34,34,"Moses would always remove the veil when he went into the sacred tent to speak with the LORD . And when he came out, he would tell the people everything the LORD had told him to say."
Exodus,34,35,"They could see that his face was still shining. So after he had spoken with them, he would put the veil back on and leave it on until the next time he went to speak with the LORD."
Exodus,35,1,Moses called together the people of Israel and told them that the LORD had said:
Exodus,35,2,"You have six days in which to do your work. But the seventh day must be dedicated to me, your LORD , as a day of rest. Whoever works on the Sabbath will be put to death."
Exodus,35,3,Don't even build a cooking fire at home on the Sabbath.
Exodus,35,4,Moses told the people of Israel that the LORD had said:
Exodus,35,5,"I would welcome an offering from anyone who wants to give something. You may bring gold, silver, or bronze;"
Exodus,35,6,"blue, purple, or red wool; fine linen; goat hair;"
Exodus,35,7,tanned ram skin or fine leather; acacia wood;
Exodus,35,8,olive oil for the lamp; sweet-smelling spices for the oil of dedication and for the incense; or
Exodus,35,9,onyx stones or other gems for the sacred apron and breastpiece.
Exodus,35,10,"If you have any skills, you should use them to help make what I have commanded:"
Exodus,35,11,"the sacred tent with its covering and hooks, its framework and crossbars, and its post and stands;"
Exodus,35,12,"the sacred chest with its carrying poles, its place of mercy, and the curtain in front of it;"
Exodus,35,13,"the table with all that goes on it, including the sacred bread;"
Exodus,35,14,the lamp with its equipment and oil;
Exodus,35,15,the incense altar with its carrying poles and sweet-smelling incense; the ordination oil; the curtain for the entrance to the sacred tent;
Exodus,35,16,"the altar for sacrifices with its bronze grating, its carrying poles, and its equipment; the large bronze bowl with its stand;"
Exodus,35,17,the curtains with the posts and stands that go around the courtyard;
Exodus,35,18,the pegs and ropes for the tent and the courtyard;
Exodus,35,19,and the finely woven priestly clothes for Aaron and his sons.
Exodus,35,20,"Moses finished speaking, and everyone left."
Exodus,35,21,"Then those who wanted to bring gifts to the LORD , brought them to be used for the sacred tent, the worship services, and the priestly clothes."
Exodus,35,22,"Men and women came willingly and gave all kinds of gold jewellery such as pins, earrings, rings, and necklaces."
Exodus,35,23,"Everyone brought their blue, purple, and red wool, their fine linen, and their cloth made of goat hair, as well as their ram skins dyed red and their fine leather."
Exodus,35,24,Anyone who had silver or bronze or acacia wood brought it as a gift to the LORD.
Exodus,35,25,"The women who were good at weaving cloth brought the blue, purple, and red wool and the fine linen they had made."
Exodus,35,26,And the women who knew how to make cloth from goat hair were glad to do so.
Exodus,35,27,The leaders brought different kinds of jewels to be sewn on the special clothes and the breastpiece for the high priest.
Exodus,35,28,They also brought sweet-smelling spices to be mixed with the incense and olive oil that were for the lamps and for ordaining the priests.
Exodus,35,29,"Moses had told the people what the LORD wanted them to do, and many of them decided to bring their gifts."
Exodus,35,30,Moses said to the people of Israel: The LORD has chosen Bezalel of the Judah tribe.
Exodus,36,1,"The LORD has given to Bezalel, Oholiab, and others the skills needed for building a place of worship, and they will follow the LORD 's instructions."
Exodus,36,2,"Then Moses brought together these workers who were eager to work,"
Exodus,36,3,"and he gave them the money that the people of Israel had donated for building the place of worship. In fact, so much money was being given each morning,"
Exodus,36,4,that finally everyone stopped working
Exodus,36,5,"and said, “Moses, there is already more money than we need for what the LORD has assigned us to do.”"
Exodus,36,6,"So Moses sent word for the people to stop giving, and they did."
Exodus,36,7,But there was already more than enough to do what needed to be done.
Exodus,37,1,"Bezalel built a chest of acacia wood one hundred and ten centimetres long, sixty-six centimetres wide, and sixty-six centimetres high."
Exodus,37,2,He covered it inside and out with pure gold and put a gold edging around the top.
Exodus,37,3,He made four gold rings and fastened one of them to each of the four legs of the chest.
Exodus,37,4,"Then he made two poles of acacia wood, covered them with gold,"
Exodus,37,5,"and put them through the rings, so the chest could be carried by the poles."
Exodus,37,6,"The entire lid of the chest, which was also covered with pure gold, was the place of mercy."
Exodus,38,1,Bezalel built an altar of acacia wood for offering sacrifices. It was two and a quarter metres square and one and a third metres high
Exodus,38,2,"with each of its four corners sticking up like the horn of a bull, and it was completely covered with bronze."
Exodus,38,3,"The equipment for the altar was also made of bronze—the pans for the hot ashes, the shovels, the meat forks, and the fire pans."
Exodus,38,4,Half-way up the altar he built a ledge around it and covered the bottom half of the altar with a decorative bronze grating.
Exodus,38,5,Then he attached a bronze ring beneath the ledge at the four corners to put the poles through.
Exodus,38,6,He covered two acacia wood poles with bronze and
Exodus,38,7,"put them through the rings for carrying the altar, which was shaped like an open box."
Exodus,38,8,Bezalel made a large bowl and a stand out of bronze from the mirrors of the women who helped at the entrance to the sacred tent.
Exodus,39,1,"Beautiful priestly clothes were made of blue, purple, and red wool for Aaron to wear when he performed his duties in the holy place. This was done exactly as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Exodus,40,1,The LORD said to Moses:
Exodus,40,2,Set up my tent on the first day of the year
Exodus,40,3,and put the chest with the Ten Commandments behind the inside curtain of the tent.
Exodus,40,4,Bring in the table and set on it those things that are made for it. Also bring in the lampstand and attach the lamps to it.
Exodus,40,5,Then place the gold altar of incense in front of the sacred chest and hang a curtain at the entrance to the tent.
Exodus,40,6,Set the altar for burning sacrifices in front of the entrance to my tent.
Exodus,40,7,Put the large bronze bowl between the tent and the altar and fill the bowl with water.
Exodus,40,8,Surround the tent and the altar with the wall of curtains and hang the curtain that was made for the entrance.
Exodus,40,9,Use the sacred olive oil to dedicate the tent and everything in it to me.
Exodus,40,10,Do the same thing with the altar for offering sacrifices and its equipment
Exodus,40,11,and with the bowl and its stand.
Exodus,40,12,Bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the tent and make them wash themselves.
Exodus,40,13,"Dress Aaron in the priestly clothes, then use the sacred olive oil to ordain him and dedicate him to me as my priest."
Exodus,40,14,Put the priestly robes on Aaron's sons
Exodus,40,15,"and ordain them in the same way, so they and their descendants will always be my priests."
Exodus,40,16,Moses followed the LORD 's instructions.
Exodus,40,17,"And on the first day of the first month of the second year, the sacred tent was set up."
Exodus,40,18,"The posts, stands, and framework were put in place,"
Exodus,40,19,then the two layers of coverings were hung over them.
Exodus,40,20,"The stones with the Ten Commandments written on them were stored in the sacred chest, the place of mercy was put on top of it, and the carrying poles were attached."
Exodus,40,21,The chest was brought into the tent and set behind the curtain in the most holy place. These things were done exactly as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Exodus,40,22,"The table for the sacred bread was put along the north wall of the holy place,"
Exodus,40,23,after which the bread was set on the table.
Exodus,40,24,"The lampstand was put along the south wall,"
Exodus,40,25,then the lamps were attached to it there in the presence of the LORD.
Exodus,40,26,"The gold incense altar was set up in front of the curtain,"
Exodus,40,27,and sweet-smelling incense was burnt on it. These things were done exactly as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Exodus,40,28,The curtain was hung at the entrance to the sacred tent.
Exodus,40,29,"Then the altar for offering sacrifices was put in front of the tent, and animal sacrifices and gifts of grain were offered there."
Exodus,40,30,"The large bronze bowl was placed between the altar and the entrance to the tent. It was filled with water,"
Exodus,40,31,"then Moses and Aaron, together with Aaron's sons, washed their hands and feet."
Exodus,40,32,"In fact, they washed each time before entering the tent or offering sacrifices at the altar. These things were done exactly as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Exodus,40,33,"Finally, Moses had the curtain hung around the courtyard."
Exodus,40,34,Suddenly the sacred tent was covered by a thick cloud and filled with the glory of the LORD.
Exodus,40,35,"And so, Moses could not enter the tent."
Exodus,40,36,"Whenever the cloud moved from the tent, the people would break camp and follow;"
Exodus,40,37,"then they would set up camp and stay there, until it moved again."
Exodus,40,38,"No matter where the people travelled, the LORD was with them. Each day his cloud was over the tent, and each night a fire could be seen in the cloud."
