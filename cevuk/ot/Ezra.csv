Ezra,1,1,"Years ago the LORD sent Jeremiah with a message about a promise for the people of Israel. Then in the first year that Cyrus was king of Persia, the LORD kept his promise by telling Cyrus to send this official message to all parts of his kingdom:"
Ezra,2,1,King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia had captured many of the people of Judah and had taken them as prisoners to Babylonia. Now they were on their way back to Jerusalem and to their own towns everywhere in Judah.
Ezra,3,1,"During the seventh month of the year, the Israelites who had settled in their towns went to Jerusalem."
Ezra,3,2,"The priest Joshua son of Jozadak, together with the other priests, and Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and his relatives rebuilt the altar of Israel's God. Then they were able to offer sacrifices there by following the instructions God had given to Moses."
Ezra,3,3,"And they built the altar where it had stood before, even though they were afraid of the people who were already living around there. Then every morning and evening they burnt sacrifices and offerings to the LORD."
Ezra,3,4,The people followed the rules for celebrating the Festival of Shelters and offered the proper sacrifices each day.
Ezra,3,5,"They offered sacrifices to please the LORD, sacrifices at each New Moon Festival, and sacrifices at the rest of the LORD 's festivals. Every offering the people had brought was presented to the LORD."
Ezra,3,6,"Although work on the temple itself had not yet begun, the people started offering sacrifices on the LORD 's altar on the first day of the seventh month of that year."
Ezra,3,7,"King Cyrus of Persia had said the Israelites could have cedar trees brought from Lebanon to Joppa by sea. So they sent grain, wine, and olive oil to the cities of Tyre and Sidon as payment for these trees, and they gave money to the stoneworkers and carpenters."
Ezra,3,8,"During the second month of the second year after the people had returned from Babylonia, they started rebuilding the LORD 's temple. Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Joshua son of Jozadak, the priests, the Levites, and everyone else who had returned started working. Every Levite over twenty years of age was put in charge of some part of the work."
Ezra,3,9,The Levites in charge of the whole project were Joshua and his sons and relatives and Kadmiel and his sons from the family of Hodaviah. The family of Henadad worked along with them.
Ezra,3,10,"When the builders had finished laying the foundation of the temple, the priests put on their robes and blew trumpets in honour of the LORD , while the Levites from the family of Asaph praised God with cymbals. All of them followed the instructions given years before by King David."
Ezra,3,11,They praised the LORD and gave thanks as they took turns singing: “The LORD is good! His faithful love for Israel will last for ever.” Everyone started shouting and praising the LORD because work on the foundation of the temple had begun.
Ezra,3,12,Many of the older priests and Levites and the heads of families cried aloud because they remembered seeing the first temple years before. But others were so happy that they celebrated with joyful shouts.
Ezra,3,13,Their shouting and crying were so noisy that it all sounded alike and could be heard a long way off.
Ezra,4,1,The enemies of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin heard that the people had come back to rebuild the temple of the LORD God of Israel.
Ezra,4,2,"So they went to Zerubbabel and to the family leaders and said, “Let us help! Ever since King Esarhaddon of Assyria brought us here, we have worshipped your God and offered sacrifices to him.”"
Ezra,4,3,"But Zerubbabel, Joshua, and the family leaders answered, “You cannot take part in building a temple for the LORD our God! We will build it ourselves, just as King Cyrus of Persia commanded us.”"
Ezra,4,4,Then the neighbouring people began to do everything possible to frighten the Jews and to make them stop building.
Ezra,4,5,"During the time when Cyrus was king and even until Darius became king, they kept bribing government officials to slow down the work."
Ezra,4,6,"In the first year that Xerxes was king, the neighbouring people brought written charges against the people of Judah and Jerusalem."
Ezra,4,7,"Later, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and their advisers got together and wrote a letter to Artaxerxes when he was king of Persia. It was written in Aramaic and had to be translated."
Ezra,5,1,Then the LORD God of Israel told the prophets Haggai and Zechariah to speak in his name to the people of Judah and Jerusalem. And they did.
Ezra,5,2,"So Zerubbabel the governor and Joshua the priest urged the people to start working on the temple again, and God's prophets encouraged them."
Ezra,5,3,"Governor Tattenai of Western Province and his assistant Shethar Bozenai got together with some of their officials. Then they went to Jerusalem and said to the people, “Who told you to rebuild this temple?"
Ezra,5,4,Give us the names of the workers!”
Ezra,5,5,But God was looking after the Jewish leaders. So the governor and his group decided not to make the people stop working on the temple until they could report to Darius and get his advice.
Ezra,5,6,"Governor Tattenai, Shethar Bozenai, and their advisers sent a report to Darius,"
Ezra,5,7,"which said: King Darius, we wish you the best!"
Ezra,5,8,"We went to Judah, where the temple of the great God is being built with huge stones and wooden beams set in the walls. Everyone is working hard, and the building is going up fast."
Ezra,5,9,We asked those in charge to tell us who gave them permission to rebuild the temple.
Ezra,5,10,"We also asked for the names of their leaders, so that we could write them down for you."
Ezra,5,11,They claimed to be servants of the God who rules heaven and earth. And they said they were rebuilding the temple that was built many years ago by one of Israel's greatest kings.
Ezra,5,12,"We were told that their people had made God angry, and he let them be captured by Nebuchadnezzar, the Babylonian king who took them away as captives to Babylonia. Nebuchadnezzar tore down their temple,"
Ezra,6,1,King Darius ordered someone to go through the old records kept in Babylonia.
Ezra,6,2,"Finally, a scroll was found in Ecbatana, the capital of Media Province, and it said: This official record will show"
Ezra,6,3,"that in the first year Cyrus was king, he gave orders to rebuild God's temple in Jerusalem, so that sacrifices and offerings could be presented there. It is to be built twenty-seven metres high and twenty-seven metres wide,"
Ezra,6,4,with one row of wooden beams for each three rows of large stones. The royal treasury will pay for everything.
Ezra,6,5,Then return to their proper places the gold and silver things that Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple and brought to Babylonia.
Ezra,6,6,"King Darius sent this message: Governor Tattenai of Western Province and Shethar Bozenai, you and your advisers must stay away from the temple."
Ezra,6,7,Let the Jewish governor and leaders rebuild it where it stood before. And stop slowing them down!
Ezra,6,8,"Starting at once, I am ordering you to help the leaders by paying their expenses from the tax money collected in Western Province."
Ezra,6,9,"And don't fail to let the priests in Jerusalem have whatever they need each day so they can offer sacrifices to the God of heaven. Give them young bulls, rams, sheep, as well as wheat, salt, wine, and olive oil."
Ezra,6,10,I want them to be able to offer pleasing sacrifices to God and to pray for me and my family.
Ezra,6,11,"If any of you don't obey this order, a wooden beam will be taken from your house and sharpened on one end. Then it will be driven through your body, and your house will be torn down and turned into a rubbish dump."
Ezra,6,12,"I ask the God who is worshipped in Jerusalem to destroy any king or nation who tries either to change what I have said or to tear down his temple. I, Darius, give these orders, and I expect them to be followed carefully."
Ezra,6,13,"Governor Tattenai, Shethar Bozenai, and their advisers carefully obeyed King Darius."
Ezra,6,14,"With great success the Jewish leaders continued working on the temple, while Haggai and Zechariah encouraged them by their preaching. And so, the temple was completed at the command of the God of Israel and by the orders of kings Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes of Persia."
Ezra,6,15,"On the third day of the month of Adar in the sixth year of the rule of Darius, the temple was finished."
Ezra,6,16,"The people of Israel, the priests, the Levites, and everyone else who had returned from exile were happy and celebrated as they dedicated God's temple."
Ezra,6,17,"One hundred bulls, two hundred rams, and four hundred lambs were offered as sacrifices at the dedication. Also twelve goats were sacrificed as sin offerings for the twelve tribes of Israel."
Ezra,6,18,"Then the priests and Levites were assigned their duties in God's temple in Jerusalem, according to the instructions Moses had written."
Ezra,6,19,Everyone who had returned from exile celebrated Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.
Ezra,6,20,"The priests and Levites had gone through a ceremony to make themselves acceptable to lead in worship. Then some of them killed Passover lambs for those who had returned, including the other priests and themselves."
Ezra,6,21,The sacrifices were eaten by the Israelites who had returned and by the neighbouring people who had given up the sinful customs of other nations in order to worship the LORD God of Israel.
Ezra,6,22,For seven days they celebrated the Festival of Thin Bread. Everyone was happy because the LORD God of Israel had made sure that the king of Assyria would be kind to them and help them build the temple.
Ezra,8,1,Artaxerxes was king of Persia when I led the following chiefs of the family groups from Babylonia to Jerusalem:
Ezra,9,1,"Later the Jewish leaders came to me and said: Many Israelites, including priests and Levites, are living just like the people around them. They are even guilty of some of the horrible sins of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites."
Ezra,9,2,"Some Israelite men have married foreign women and have let their sons do the same thing. Our own officials and leaders were the first to commit this disgusting sin, and now God's holy people are mixed with foreigners."
Ezra,9,3,This news made me so angry that I ripped my clothes and tore hair from my head and beard. Then I just sat in shock
Ezra,9,4,"until time for the evening sacrifice. Many of our people were greatly concerned and gathered around me, because the God of Israel had warned us to stay away from foreigners."
Ezra,9,5,"At the time of the evening sacrifice, I was still sitting there in sorrow with my clothes all torn. So I got down on my knees, then lifted my arms,"
Ezra,9,6,"and prayed: I am much too ashamed to face you, LORD God. Our sins and our guilt have swept over us like a flood that reaches up to the heavens."
Ezra,9,7,"Since the time of our ancestors, all of us have sinned. That's why we, our kings, and our priests have often been defeated by other kings. They have killed some of us and made slaves of others; they have taken our possessions and made us ashamed, just as we are today."
Ezra,9,8,"But for now, LORD God, you have shown great kindness to us. You made us truly happy by letting some of us settle in this sacred place and by helping us in our time of slavery."
Ezra,9,9,"We are slaves, but you have never turned your back on us. You love us, and because of you, the kings of Persia have helped us. It's as though you have given us new life! You let us rebuild your temple and live safely in Judah and Jerusalem."
Ezra,9,10,"Our God, what can we say now? Even after all this, we have disobeyed the commands"
Ezra,9,11,"that were given to us by your servants the prophets. They said the land you are giving us is full of sinful and wicked people, who never stop doing disgusting things."
Ezra,9,12,"And we were warned not to let our daughters and sons marry their sons and daughters. Your prophets also told us never to help those foreigners or even let them live in peace. You wanted us to become strong and to enjoy the good things in the land, then some day to leave it to our children for ever."
Ezra,9,13,"You punished us because of our terrible sins. But you did not punish us nearly as much as we deserve, and you have brought some of us back home."
Ezra,9,14,Why should we disobey your commands again by letting our sons and daughters marry these foreigners who do such disgusting things? That would make you angry enough to destroy us all!
Ezra,9,15,"LORD God of Israel, you have been more than fair by letting a few of us survive. But once again, our sins have made us ashamed to face you."
Ezra,10,1,"While Ezra was down on his knees in front of God's temple, praying with tears in his eyes, and confessing the sins of the people of Israel, a large number of men, women, and children gathered around him and cried bitterly."
Ezra,10,2,"Shecaniah son of Jehiel from the family of Elam said: Ezra, we have disobeyed God by marrying these foreign women. But there is still hope for the people of Israel,"
Ezra,10,3,"if we follow your advice and the advice of others who truly respect the laws of God. We must promise God that we will divorce our foreign wives and send them away, together with their children."
Ezra,10,4,"Ezra, it's up to you to do something! We will support whatever you do. So be brave!"
Ezra,10,5,"Ezra stood up and made the chief priests, the Levites, and everyone else in Israel swear that they would follow the advice of Shecaniah."
Ezra,10,6,"Then Ezra left God's temple and went to spend the night in the living quarters of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. He felt sorry for what the people had done, and he did not eat or drink a thing."
