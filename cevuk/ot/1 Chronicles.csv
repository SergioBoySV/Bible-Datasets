1 Chronicles,11,1,"Israel's leaders met with David at Hebron and said, “We are your relatives,"
1 Chronicles,11,2,"and we know that you have led our army into battle, even when Saul was still our king. The LORD God has promised that you would rule our country and take care of us like a shepherd."
1 Chronicles,11,3,So we have come to crown you king of Israel.” David made an agreement with the leaders and asked the LORD to be their witness. Then the leaders poured olive oil on David's head to show that he was now king of Israel. This happened just as the LORD 's prophet Samuel had said.
1 Chronicles,11,4,"Jerusalem was called Jebus at the time, and David led Israel's army to attack the town."
1 Chronicles,11,5,"The Jebusites said, “You won't be able to get in here!” But David captured the fortress of Mount Zion, which is now called the City of David."

1 Chronicles,11,9,"David became a great and strong ruler, because the LORD All-Powerful was on his side."
1 Chronicles,11,10,"The LORD had promised that David would become king, and so everyone in Israel gave David their support. Certain warriors also helped keep his kingdom strong."
1 Chronicles,11,11,"The first of these warriors was Jashobeam the son of Hachmoni, the leader of the Three Warriors. In one battle he killed three hundred men with his spear."
1 Chronicles,11,12,Another one of the Three Warriors was Eleazar son of Dodo the Ahohite.
1 Chronicles,11,13,"During a battle against the Philistines at Pas-Dammim, all the Israelite soldiers ran away,"
1 Chronicles,11,14,"except Eleazar, who stayed with David. They took their positions in a nearby barley field and defeated the Philistines! The LORD gave Israel a great victory that day."
1 Chronicles,11,15,One time the Three Warriors went to meet David among the rocks at Adullam Cave. The Philistine army had set up camp in Rephaim Valley
1 Chronicles,11,16,"and had taken over Bethlehem. David was in a fortress,"
1 Chronicles,11,17,"and he said, “I'm very thirsty. I wish I had a drink of water from the well by the gate to Bethlehem.”"
1 Chronicles,11,18,"The Three Warriors sneaked through the Philistine camp and got some water from the well near Bethlehem's gate. They took it back to David, but he refused to drink it. Instead, he poured out the water as a sacrifice to the LORD"
1 Chronicles,11,19,"and said, “Drinking this water would be like drinking the blood of these men who risked their lives to get it for me.” The Three Warriors did these brave deeds."
1 Chronicles,11,20,"Joab's brother Abishai was the leader of the Thirty Warriors, and in one battle he killed three hundred men with his spear. He was just as famous as the Three Warriors"
1 Chronicles,11,21,"and was more famous than the rest of the Thirty Warriors. He was their commander, but he never became one of the Three Warriors."
1 Chronicles,11,22,"Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was a brave man from Kabzeel who did some amazing things. One time he killed two of Moab's best fighters, and one snowy day he went into a pit and killed a lion."
1 Chronicles,11,23,"Another time he killed an Egyptian who was over two metres tall and was armed with a spear. Benaiah only had a club, so he grabbed the spear from the Egyptian and killed him with it."
1 Chronicles,11,24,"Benaiah did things like that; he was just as brave as the Three Warriors,"
1 Chronicles,11,25,even though he never became one of them. And he was certainly as famous as the rest of the Thirty Warriors. So David made him the leader of his own bodyguard.
1 Chronicles,12,1,"Some time earlier, David had gone to live in the town of Ziklag to escape from King Saul. While David was there, several brave warriors joined him to help fight his battles."
1 Chronicles,12,2,"Several of these warriors were from King Saul's own tribe of Benjamin. They were experts at using a bow and arrows, and they could shoot an arrow or sling a stone with either hand."
1 Chronicles,13,1,"Some time later, David talked with his army commanders,"
1 Chronicles,14,1,"King Hiram of Tyre sent some officials to David. They brought along carpenters and stone workers, and enough cedar logs to build David a palace."
1 Chronicles,14,2,David now knew that the LORD had made him a powerful king of Israel for the good of his people.
1 Chronicles,14,3,"After David moved to Jerusalem, he married more women and had more sons and daughters."
1 Chronicles,15,1,"David had several buildings built in Jerusalem, and he had a tent set up where the sacred chest would be kept."
1 Chronicles,15,2,"He said, “Only Levites will be allowed to carry the chest, because the LORD has chosen them to do that work and to serve him for ever.”"
1 Chronicles,15,3,"Next, David invited everyone to come to Jerusalem and watch the sacred chest being carried to the place he had set up for it."
1 Chronicles,15,4,He also sent for Aaron's descendants and for the Levites. The Levites who came were:
1 Chronicles,15,5,"Uriel, the leader of the Kohath clan, and one hundred and twenty of his relatives;"
1 Chronicles,15,6,"Asaiah, the leader of the Merari clan, and two hundred and twenty of his relatives;"
1 Chronicles,15,7,"Joel, the leader of the Gershon clan, and one hundred and thirty of his relatives;"
1 Chronicles,15,8,"Shemaiah, the leader of the Elizaphan clan, and two hundred of his relatives;"
1 Chronicles,15,9,"Eliel, the leader of the Hebron clan, and eighty of his relatives; and"
1 Chronicles,15,10,"Amminadab, the leader of the Uzziel clan, with one hundred and twelve of his relatives."
1 Chronicles,15,11,"David called together these six Levites and the two priests, Zadok and Abiathar."
1 Chronicles,15,12,"He said to them, “You are the leaders of the clans in the Levi tribe. You and your relatives must first go through the ceremony to make yourselves clean and acceptable to the LORD . Then you may carry the sacred chest that belongs to the LORD God of Israel and bring it to the place I have prepared for it."
1 Chronicles,15,13,"The first time we tried to bring the chest to Jerusalem, we didn't ask the LORD what he wanted us to do. He was angry with us, because you Levites weren't there to carry the chest.”"
1 Chronicles,15,14,The priests and the Levites made themselves clean. They were now ready to carry the sacred chest
1 Chronicles,15,15,"on poles that rested on their shoulders, just as the LORD had told Moses to do."
1 Chronicles,15,16,"David then told the leaders to choose some Levites to sing and play music on small harps, other stringed instruments, and cymbals."
1 Chronicles,16,1,"They put the sacred chest inside the tent that David had set up for it, then they offered sacrifices to please the LORD and sacrifices to ask his blessing."
1 Chronicles,16,2,"After David had finished, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD"
1 Chronicles,16,3,"and gave every person in the crowd a small loaf of bread, some meat, and a handful of raisins."
1 Chronicles,16,4,David appointed some of the Levites to serve at the sacred chest; they were to play music and sing praises to the LORD God of Israel.
1 Chronicles,16,5,"Asaph was their leader, and Zechariah was his assistant. Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-Edom, and another man named Jeiel were appointed to play small harps and stringed instruments. Asaph himself played the cymbals,"
1 Chronicles,16,6,and the two priests Benaiah and Jahaziel were to blow trumpets every day in front of the sacred chest.
1 Chronicles,16,7,"That same day, David instructed Asaph and his relatives for the first time to sing these praises to the LORD:"
1 Chronicles,16,8,Praise the LORD and pray in his name! Tell everyone what he has done.
1 Chronicles,16,9,Sing praises to the LORD! Tell about his miracles.
1 Chronicles,16,10,Celebrate and worship his holy name with all your heart.
1 Chronicles,16,11,Trust the LORD and his mighty power. Worship him always.
1 Chronicles,16,12,Remember his miracles and all his wonders and his fair decisions.
1 Chronicles,16,13,"You belong to the family of Israel, his servant; you are his chosen ones, the descendants of Jacob."
1 Chronicles,16,14,"The LORD is our God, bringing justice everywhere on earth."
1 Chronicles,16,15,"We must never forget his agreement and his promises, not in thousands of years."
1 Chronicles,17,1,"Soon after David moved into his new palace, he said to Nathan the prophet, “Look around! I live in a palace made of cedar, but the sacred chest is kept in a tent.”"
1 Chronicles,17,2,"Nathan replied, “The LORD is with you—do what you want.”"
1 Chronicles,17,3,"That night, the LORD told Nathan"
1 Chronicles,17,4,"to go to David and tell him: David, you are my servant, so listen carefully: you are not the one to build a temple for me."
1 Chronicles,17,5,"I didn't live in a temple when I brought my people out of Egypt, and I don't live in one now. A tent has always been my home wherever I have gone with them."
1 Chronicles,17,6,I chose special leaders and told them to be like shepherds for my people Israel. But did I ever say anything to even one of them about building a cedar temple for me?
1 Chronicles,17,7,"David, this is what I, the LORD All-Powerful, say to you. I brought you in from the fields where you took care of sheep, and I made you the leader of my people."
1 Chronicles,17,8,"Wherever you went, I helped you and destroyed your enemies right in front of your eyes. I have made you one of the most famous people in the world."
1 Chronicles,17,9,"I have given my people Israel a land of their own where they can live in peace. They will no longer have to tremble with fear—evil nations won't bother them, as they did"
1 Chronicles,17,10,"when I let judges rule my people, and I will keep your enemies from attacking you. Now I promise that like you, your descendants will be kings."
1 Chronicles,17,11,"I'll choose one of your sons to be king when you reach the end of your life and are buried beside your ancestors. I'll make him a strong ruler,"
1 Chronicles,17,12,and no one will be able to take his kingdom away from him. He will be the one to build a temple for me.
1 Chronicles,17,13,"I will be like a father to him, and he will be like a son to me. I will never put an end to my agreement with him, as I put an end to my agreement with Saul, who was king before you."
1 Chronicles,17,14,I will make sure that your son and his descendants will rule my people and my kingdom for ever.
1 Chronicles,17,15,Nathan told David exactly what the LORD had said.
1 Chronicles,17,16,"David went into the tent he had set up for the sacred chest. He sat there and prayed: LORD God, my family and I don't deserve what you have already done for us,"
1 Chronicles,17,17,and yet you have promised to do even more for my descendants. You are treating me as if I am a very important person.
1 Chronicles,17,18,"I am your servant, and you know my thoughts. What else can I say, except that you have honoured me?"
1 Chronicles,17,19,It was your choice to do these wonderful things for me and to make these promises.
1 Chronicles,17,20,"No other god is like you, LORD —you alone are God. Everything we have heard about you is true."
1 Chronicles,17,21,"And there is no other nation on earth like Israel, the nation you rescued from slavery in Egypt to be your own. You became famous by using great and wonderful miracles to force other nations and their gods out of your land, so that your people could live here."
1 Chronicles,17,22,"You have chosen Israel to be your people for ever, and you have become their God."
1 Chronicles,17,23," LORD God, please do what you promised me and my descendants."
1 Chronicles,17,24,"Then you will be famous for ever, and everyone will say, “The LORD All-Powerful rules Israel and is their God.” My kingdom will be strong,"
1 Chronicles,17,25,"because you are my God, and you have promised that my descendants will be kings. That's why I have the courage to pray to you like this, even though I am only your servant."
1 Chronicles,17,26,"You are the LORD God, and you have made this good promise to me."
1 Chronicles,17,27,"Now please bless my descendants for ever, and let them always be your chosen kings. You have already blessed my family, and I know you will bless us for ever."
1 Chronicles,18,1,"Later, David attacked and defeated the Philistines. He captured their town of Gath and the nearby villages."
1 Chronicles,18,2,"David also defeated the Moabites, and so they had to accept him as their ruler and pay taxes to him."
1 Chronicles,18,3,"While King Hadadezer of Zobah was trying to gain control of the territory near the River Euphrates, David met him in battle at Hamath and defeated him."
1 Chronicles,18,4,"David captured one thousand chariots, seven thousand chariot drivers, and twenty thousand soldiers. And he crippled all but one hundred of the horses."
1 Chronicles,18,5,"When troops from the Syrian kingdom of Damascus came to help Hadadezer, David killed twenty-two thousand of them."
1 Chronicles,18,6,"Then David stationed some of his troops in Damascus, and the people there had to accept David as their ruler and pay taxes to him. Everywhere David went, the LORD helped him win battles."
1 Chronicles,18,7,"Hadadezer's officers had carried gold shields, but David took these shields and brought them back to Jerusalem."
1 Chronicles,18,8,"He also took a lot of bronze from the cities of Tibhath and Cun, which had belonged to Hadadezer. Later, Solomon used this bronze to make the large bowl called the Sea, and to make the pillars and other furnishings for the temple."
1 Chronicles,19,1,"Some time later, King Nahash of Ammon died, and his son Hanun became king."
1 Chronicles,19,2,"David said, “Nahash was kind to me, so I will be kind to his son.” He sent some officials to Ammon to tell Hanun how sorry he was that his father had died. But when David's officials arrived at Ammon,"
1 Chronicles,19,3,"the Ammonite leaders said to Hanun, “Do you really believe King David is honouring your father by sending these men to comfort you? He probably sent them to spy on our country, so he can come and destroy it.”"
1 Chronicles,19,4,"Hanun arrested David's officials and had their beards shaved off and their robes cut off just below the waist, and then he sent them away."
1 Chronicles,19,5,"They were terribly ashamed. When David found out what had happened to his officials, he sent a message that told them, “Stay in Jericho until your beards grow back. Then you can come home.”"
1 Chronicles,19,6,The Ammonites realized they had made David furious. So they paid thirty-four thousand kilogrammes of silver to hire chariot troops from Mesopotamia and from the Syrian kingdoms of Maacah and Zobah.
1 Chronicles,19,7,"Thirty-two thousand troops, as well as the king of Maacah and his army, came and camped near Medeba. The Ammonite troops also left their towns and came to prepare for battle."
1 Chronicles,19,8,"David heard what was happening, and he sent out Joab with his army."
1 Chronicles,19,9,"The Ammonite troops marched to the entrance of the city and prepared for battle, while the Syrian troops took their positions in the open fields."
1 Chronicles,19,10,Joab saw that the enemy troops were lined up on both sides of him. So he picked some of the best Israelite soldiers to fight the Syrians.
1 Chronicles,19,11,Then he put his brother Abishai in command of the rest of the army and told them to fight against the Ammonites.
1 Chronicles,19,12,"Joab told his brother, “If the Syrians are too much for me to handle, come and help me. And if the Ammonites are too strong for you, I'll come and help you."
1 Chronicles,19,13,Be brave and fight hard to protect our people and the towns of our LORD God. I pray he will do whatever pleases him.”
1 Chronicles,19,14,"Joab and his soldiers attacked the Syrians, and the Syrians ran from them."
1 Chronicles,19,15,"When the Ammonite troops saw that the Syrians had run away, they ran from Abishai's soldiers and went back into their own city. Joab then returned to Jerusalem."
1 Chronicles,19,16,"As soon as the Syrians realized they had been defeated, they sent for their troops that were stationed on the other side of the River Euphrates. Shophach, the commander of Hadadezer's army, led these troops to Ammon."
1 Chronicles,19,17,"David found out what the Syrians were doing, and he brought Israel's entire army together. They crossed the River Jordan, and he commanded them to take their positions facing the Syrian troops. Soon after the fighting began,"
1 Chronicles,19,18,"the Syrians ran from Israel. David killed seven thousand chariot troops and forty thousand regular soldiers. He also killed Shophach, their commander."
1 Chronicles,19,19,"When the kings who had been under Hadadezer's rule saw that Israel had defeated them, they made peace with David and accepted him as their new ruler. The Syrians never helped the Ammonites again."
1 Chronicles,20,1,"The next spring, the time when kings go to war, Joab marched out in command of the Israelite army and destroyed towns all over the country of Ammon. He attacked the capital city of Rabbah and left it in ruins. But David stayed in Jerusalem."
1 Chronicles,20,2,"Later, David himself went to Rabbah, where he took the crown from the statue of their god Milcom. The crown was made of about thirty-four kilogrammes of gold, and there was a valuable jewel on it. David put the jewel on his crown, then carried off everything else of value."
1 Chronicles,20,3,"He forced the people of Rabbah to work with saws, iron picks, and axes. He also did the same thing with the people in all the other Ammonite towns. David then led Israel's army back to Jerusalem."
1 Chronicles,20,4,"Some time later, Israel fought a battle against the Philistines at Gezer. During this battle, Sibbecai from Hushah killed Sippai, a descendant of the Rephaim, and the Philistines were defeated."
1 Chronicles,20,5,"In another battle against the Philistines, Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath from Gath, whose spear shaft was like a weaver's beam."
1 Chronicles,20,6,"Another one of the Philistine soldiers who was a descendant of the Rephaim was as big as a giant and had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot. During a battle at Gath,"
1 Chronicles,20,7,"he made fun of Israel, so David's nephew Jonathan killed him."
1 Chronicles,20,8,David and his soldiers killed these three men from Gath who were descendants of the Rephaim.
1 Chronicles,21,1,Satan decided to cause trouble for Israel by making David think it was a good idea to find out how many people there were in Israel and Judah.
1 Chronicles,21,2,"David told Joab and the army commanders, “Count everyone in Israel, from the town of Beersheba in the south all the way north to Dan. Then I will know how many people can serve in my army.”"
1 Chronicles,21,3,"Joab answered, “Your Majesty, even if the LORD made your kingdom a hundred times larger, you would still rule everyone in it. Why do you need to know how many soldiers there are? Don't you think that would make the whole nation angry?”"
1 Chronicles,21,4,But David would not change his mind. And so Joab went everywhere in Israel and Judah and counted the people. He returned to Jerusalem
1 Chronicles,21,5,and told David that the total number of men who could serve in the army was one million one hundred thousand in Israel and four hundred and seventy thousand in Judah.
1 Chronicles,21,6,"Joab refused to include anyone from the tribes of Levi and Benjamin, because he still disagreed with David's orders."
1 Chronicles,21,7,"David's order to count the people made God angry, and he punished Israel."
1 Chronicles,21,8,"David prayed, “I am your servant. But what I did was stupid and terribly wrong. Please forgive me.”"
1 Chronicles,21,9,"The LORD said to Gad, one of David's prophets,"
1 Chronicles,21,10,“Tell David that I will punish him in one of three ways. But he will have to choose which one it will be.”
1 Chronicles,21,11,Gad went to David and told him: You must choose how the LORD will punish you:
1 Chronicles,21,12,"Will there be three years when the land won't grow enough food for its people? Or will your enemies constantly defeat you for three months? Or will the LORD send a horrible disease to strike your land for three days? Think about it and decide, because I have to give your answer to God who sent me."
1 Chronicles,21,13,"David was miserable and said, “It's a terrible choice to make! But the LORD is kind, and I'd rather be punished by him than by anyone else.”"
1 Chronicles,21,14,"So the LORD sent a horrible disease on Israel, and seventy thousand Israelites died."
1 Chronicles,21,15,"Then he sent an angel to destroy the city of Jerusalem. But just as the angel was about to do that, the LORD felt sorry for all the suffering he had caused the people, and he told the angel, “Stop! They have suffered enough.” This happened at the threshing place that belonged to Araunah the Jebusite."
1 Chronicles,21,16,"David saw the LORD 's angel in the air, holding a sword over Jerusalem. He and the leaders of Israel, who were all wearing sackcloth, bowed with their faces to the ground,"
1 Chronicles,21,17,"and David prayed, “It's my fault! I sinned by ordering the people to be counted. They have done nothing wrong—they are innocent sheep. LORD God, please punish me and my family. Don't let the disease wipe out your people.”"
1 Chronicles,21,18,The LORD 's angel told the prophet Gad to tell David that he must go to Araunah's threshing place and build an altar in honour of the LORD.
1 Chronicles,21,19,David followed the LORD 's instructions.
1 Chronicles,21,20,"Araunah and his four sons were threshing wheat at the time, and when they saw the angel, the four sons ran to hide."
1 Chronicles,21,21,"Just then, David arrived, and when Araunah saw him, he stopped his work and bowed down."
1 Chronicles,21,22,"David said, “Would you sell me your threshing place, so I can build an altar on it to the LORD ? Then this disease will stop killing the people. I'm willing to pay whatever you say it's worth.”"
1 Chronicles,21,23,"Araunah answered, “Take it, Your Majesty, and do whatever you want with it. I'll even give you the oxen for the sacrifice and the wheat for the grain sacrifice. And you can use the threshing boards for the fire. It's all yours!”"
1 Chronicles,21,24,"But David replied, “No! I want to pay you what they're worth. I can't just take something from you and then offer the LORD a sacrifice that cost me nothing.”"
1 Chronicles,21,25,So David paid Araunah six hundred gold coins for his threshing place.
1 Chronicles,21,26,"David built an altar and offered sacrifices to please the LORD and sacrifices to ask his blessing. David prayed, and the LORD answered him by sending fire down on the altar."
1 Chronicles,21,27,Then the LORD commanded the angel to put the sword away.
1 Chronicles,21,28,"When David saw that the LORD had answered his prayer, he offered more sacrifices there at the threshing place,"
1 Chronicles,22,1,"David said, “The temple of the LORD God must be built here at this threshing place. And the altar for offering sacrifices will also be here.”"
1 Chronicles,22,2,David ordered the foreigners living in Israel to come to Jerusalem. Then he assigned some to cut blocks of stone for building the temple.
1 Chronicles,22,3,"He got a large supply of iron to make into nails and hinges for the doors, and he provided so much bronze that it could not be weighed."
1 Chronicles,22,4,He also had cedar logs brought in from the cities of Sidon and Tyre.
1 Chronicles,22,5,"He said, “The temple for the LORD must be great, so that everyone in the world will know about it. But since my son Solomon is young and has no experience, I will make sure that everything is ready for the temple to be built.” That's why David did all these things before he died."
1 Chronicles,22,6,David sent for his son Solomon and told him to build a temple for the LORD God of Israel.
1 Chronicles,22,7,"He said: My son, I wanted to build a temple where the LORD my God would be worshipped."
1 Chronicles,22,8,"But some time ago, he told me, “David, you have killed too many people and have fought too many battles. That's why you are not the one to build my temple."
1 Chronicles,22,9,"But when your son becomes king, I will give him peace throughout his kingdom. His name will be Solomon, because during his rule I will keep Israel safe and peaceful."
1 Chronicles,22,10,"Solomon will build my temple. He will be like a son to me, and I will be like a father to him. In fact, one of his descendants will always rule in Israel.”"
1 Chronicles,22,11,"Solomon, my son, I now pray that the LORD your God will be with you and keep his promise to help you build a temple for him."
1 Chronicles,22,12,"May he give you wisdom and knowledge, so that you can rule Israel according to his Law."
1 Chronicles,22,13,"If you obey the laws and teachings that the LORD gave Moses, you will be successful. Be strong and brave and don't get discouraged or be afraid of anything."
1 Chronicles,22,14,"I have all the supplies you'll need to build the temple: you have more than three thousand tonnes of gold and over thirty-four thousand tonnes of silver. There's also plenty of wood, stone, and more bronze and iron than I could weigh. Ask for anything else you need."
1 Chronicles,22,15,I have also assigned men who will cut and lay the stone. And there are carpenters and people who are experts in working with
1 Chronicles,22,16,"gold, silver, bronze, and iron. You have plenty of workers to do the job. Now get started, and I pray that the LORD will be with you in your work."
1 Chronicles,22,17,David then gave orders for the leaders of Israel to help Solomon.
1 Chronicles,22,18,"David said: The LORD our God has helped me defeat all the people who lived here before us, and he has given you peace from all your enemies. Now this land belongs to the LORD and his people."
1 Chronicles,22,19,"Obey the LORD your God with your heart and soul. Begin work on the temple to honour him, so that the sacred chest and the things used for worship can be kept there."
1 Chronicles,23,1,David was old when he chose his son Solomon to be king of Israel.
1 Chronicles,23,2,"Some time later, David called together all of Israel's leaders, priests, and Levites."
1 Chronicles,23,3,"He then counted the Levite men who were at least thirty years old, and the total was thirty-eight thousand."
1 Chronicles,23,4,"He said, “Twenty-four thousand of the Levites will be in charge of the temple, six thousand will be temple officials and judges,"
1 Chronicles,23,5,"four thousand will be guards at the temple, and four thousand will praise the LORD by playing the musical instruments I have given them.”"
1 Chronicles,23,6,"David then divided the Levites into three groups according to the clans of Levi's sons, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari."
1 Chronicles,23,7,Gershon had two sons: Ladan and Shimei.
1 Chronicles,23,8,"Ladan was the father of Jehiel, Zetham, and Joel."
1 Chronicles,23,9,"They were all family leaders among their father's descendants. Shimei was the father of Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran."
1 Chronicles,24,1,"Aaron's descendants were then divided into work groups. Aaron had four sons: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar."
1 Chronicles,24,2,"But Nadab and Abihu died long before their father, without having any sons. That's why Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests."
1 Chronicles,24,3,"David divided Aaron's descendants into groups, according to their assigned work. Zadok, one of Eleazar's descendants, and Ahimelech, one of Ithamar's descendants, helped David."
1 Chronicles,24,4,"Eleazar's descendants were divided into sixteen groups, and Ithamar's were divided into eight groups, because Eleazar's family included more family leaders."
1 Chronicles,24,5,"However, both families included temple officials and priests, and so to make sure the work was divided fairly, David asked God what to do."
1 Chronicles,24,6,"As each group was assigned their duties, Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the Levite wrote down the name of the family leader in charge of that group. The witnesses were David and his officials, as well as Zadok the priest, Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the family leaders from the clans of the priests and the Levites."
1 Chronicles,25,1,"David and the temple officials chose the descendants of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun to be in charge of music. They were to praise the LORD by playing cymbals, harps and other stringed instruments. Here is a list of the musicians and their duties:"
1 Chronicles,25,2,"Asaph's four sons, Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asarelah, were under the direction of their father and played music whenever the king told them to."
1 Chronicles,25,3,"Jeduthun's six sons, Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, were under the direction of their father and played harps and sang praises to the LORD."
1 Chronicles,25,4,"Heman had fourteen sons: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, Romamtiezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, Mahazioth."
1 Chronicles,25,5,"Heman was one of the king's prophets, and God honoured Heman by giving him fourteen sons and three daughters."
1 Chronicles,25,6,"His sons were under his direction and played cymbals, harps, and other stringed instruments during times of worship at the temple. Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman took their orders directly from the king."
1 Chronicles,25,7,"There were two hundred and eighty-eight of these men, and all of them were skilled musicians."
1 Chronicles,25,8,"David assigned them their duties by asking the LORD what he wanted. Everyone was responsible for something, whether young or old, teacher or student."
1 Chronicles,26,1,The temple guards were also divided into groups according to clans. Meshelemiah son of Kore was from the Korah clan and was a descendant of Asaph.
1 Chronicles,26,2,"He had seven sons, who were born in the following order: Zechariah, Jediael, Zebadiah, Jathniel,"
1 Chronicles,26,3,"Elam, Jehohanan, and Eliehoenai."
1 Chronicles,27,1,"Each month a group of twenty-four thousand men served as soldiers in Israel's army. These men, which included the family leaders, army commanders, and officials of the king, were under the command of the following men, arranged by the month of their service:"
1 Chronicles,27,2,"In the first month, Jashobeam the son of Zabdiel,"
1 Chronicles,27,3,a descendant of Perez;
1 Chronicles,27,4,"in the second month, Dodai the Ahohite, whose assistant was Mikloth;"
1 Chronicles,27,5,"in the third month, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada the priest,"
1 Chronicles,27,6,"who was the leader of the Thirty Warriors, and whose son Ammizabad was also an army commander;"
1 Chronicles,27,7,"in the fourth month, Asahel the brother of Joab, whose son Zebadiah took over command after him;"
1 Chronicles,27,8,"in the fifth month, Shamhuth from the Izrah clan;"
1 Chronicles,27,9,"in the sixth month, Ira the son of Ikkesh from Tekoa;"
1 Chronicles,27,10,"in the seventh month, Helez from Pelon in the territory of Ephraim;"
1 Chronicles,27,11,"in the eighth month, Sibbecai from Hushah of the Zerah clan;"
1 Chronicles,27,12,"in the ninth month, Abiezer from Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin;"
1 Chronicles,27,13,"in the tenth month, Maharai from Netophah of the Zerah clan;"
1 Chronicles,27,14,"in the eleventh month, Benaiah from Pirathon in the territory of Ephraim;"
1 Chronicles,27,15,"in the twelfth month, Heldai from Netophah, who was a descendant of Othniel."
1 Chronicles,28,1,"David called a meeting in Jerusalem for all Israel's leaders, including the tribal leaders, the government officials, the army commanders, the officials in charge of the royal property and livestock, the palace officials, and the brave warriors."
1 Chronicles,28,2,"After everyone was there, David stood up and said: Listen to me, my people. I wanted to build a place where the sacred chest would be kept, so we could go there and worship the LORD our God. I have prepared all the supplies for building a temple,"
1 Chronicles,28,3,"but the LORD has refused to let me build it, because he said I have killed too many people in battle."
1 Chronicles,28,4,"The LORD God chose Judah to be the leading tribe in Israel. Then from Judah, he chose my father's family, and from that family, he chose me to be the king of Israel, and he promised that my descendants will also rule as kings."
1 Chronicles,28,5,"The LORD has blessed me with many sons, but he chose my son Solomon to be the next king of Israel."
1 Chronicles,28,6,"The LORD said to me, “Your son Solomon will build my temple, and it will honour me. Solomon will be like a son to me, and I will be like a father to him."
1 Chronicles,28,7,"If he continues to obey my laws and commands, his kingdom will never end.”"
1 Chronicles,28,8,"My friends, you are the LORD 's people. And now, with God as your witness, I want you to promise that you will do your best to obey everything the LORD God has commanded us. Then this land will always belong to you and your descendants."
1 Chronicles,28,9,"Solomon, my son, worship God and obey him with all your heart and mind, just as I have done. He knows all your thoughts and your reasons for doing things, and so if you turn to him, he will hear your prayers. But if you ignore him, he will reject you for ever."
1 Chronicles,28,10,The LORD has chosen you to build a temple for worshipping him. Be confident and do the work you have been assigned.
1 Chronicles,28,11,"After David finished speaking, he gave Solomon the plans for building the main rooms of the temple, including the porch, the storerooms, the rooms upstairs and downstairs, as well as the most holy place."
1 Chronicles,28,12,"He gave Solomon his plans for the courtyards and the open areas around the temple, and for the rooms to store the temple treasures and gifts that had been dedicated to God."
1 Chronicles,28,13,"David also gave Solomon his plans for dividing the priests and the Levites into groups, as well as for the work that needed to be done at the temple and for taking care of the objects used for worship."
1 Chronicles,28,14,"He told Solomon how much gold and silver was to be used in making the sacred objects,"
1 Chronicles,28,15,"including the lampstands and lamps,"
1 Chronicles,28,16,"the gold table which held the sacred loaves of bread, the tables made of silver,"
1 Chronicles,28,17,"the meat forks, the bowls and cups,"
1 Chronicles,28,18,"the gold incense altar, and the gold statue of a chariot for the winged creatures which were on the lid of the sacred chest."
1 Chronicles,28,19,David then said to Solomon: The LORD showed me how his temple is to be built.
1 Chronicles,28,20,"But you must see that everything is done according to these plans. Be confident, and never be afraid of anything or get discouraged. The LORD my God will help you do everything needed to finish the temple, so it can be used for worshipping him."
1 Chronicles,28,21,"The priests and Levites have been assigned their duties, and all the skilled workers are prepared to do their work. The people and their leaders will do anything you tell them."
1 Chronicles,29,1,"David told the crowd: God chose my son Solomon to build the temple, but Solomon is young and has no experience. This is not just any building—this is the temple for the LORD God!"
1 Chronicles,29,2,"That's why I have done my best to get everything Solomon will need to build it—gold, silver, bronze, iron, wood, onyx, turquoise, coloured gems, all kinds of precious stones, and marble."
1 Chronicles,29,3,"Besides doing all that, I have promised to give part of my own gold and silver as a way of showing my love for God's temple."
1 Chronicles,29,4,More than a hundred tonnes of my finest gold and almost two hundred and forty tonnes of my silver will be used to decorate its walls
1 Chronicles,29,5,"and to make the gold and silver objects. Now, who else will show their dedication to the LORD by giving gifts for building his temple?"
1 Chronicles,29,6,"After David finished speaking, the family leaders, the tribal leaders, the army commanders, and the government officials voluntarily gave gifts"
1 Chronicles,29,7,"for the temple. These gifts included more than a hundred and seventy tonnes of gold, over three hundred and forty tonnes of silver, six hundred and twenty tonnes of bronze, and more than three thousand four hundred tonnes of iron."
1 Chronicles,29,8,"Everyone who owned precious stones also donated them to the temple treasury, where Jehiel from the Levite clan of Gershon guarded them."
1 Chronicles,29,9,"David and the people were very happy that so much had been given to the LORD , and they all celebrated."
1 Chronicles,29,10,"Then, in front of everyone, David sang praises to the LORD: I praise you for ever, LORD ! You are the God our ancestor Jacob worshipped."
1 Chronicles,29,11,"Your power is great, and your glory is seen everywhere in heaven and on earth. You are king of the entire world,"
1 Chronicles,29,12,and you rule with strength and power. You make people rich and powerful and famous.
1 Chronicles,29,13,"We thank you, our God, and praise you."
1 Chronicles,29,14,"But why should we be happy that we have given you these gifts? They belong to you, and we have only given back what is already yours."
1 Chronicles,29,15,"We are only foreigners living here on earth for a while, just as our ancestors were. And we will soon be gone, like a shadow that suddenly disappears."
1 Chronicles,29,16,"Our LORD God, we have brought all these things for building a temple to honour you. They belong to you, and you gave them to us."
1 Chronicles,29,17,"But we are happy, because everyone has voluntarily given you these things. You know what is in everyone's heart, and you are pleased when people are honest."
1 Chronicles,29,18,"Always make us eager to give, and help us be faithful to you, just as our ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob faithfully worshipped you."
1 Chronicles,29,19,"And give Solomon the desire to obey your laws and teachings completely, and the desire to build the temple for which I have provided these gifts."
1 Chronicles,29,20,"David then said to the people, “Now it's your turn to praise the LORD , the God your ancestors worshipped!” So everyone praised the LORD , and they bowed down to honour him and David their king."
1 Chronicles,29,21,"The next day, the Israelites slaughtered a thousand bulls, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, and they offered them as sacrifices to please the LORD, along with offerings of wine."
1 Chronicles,29,22,"The people were very happy, and they ate and drank there at the LORD 's altar. That same day, Solomon was crowned king. The people celebrated and poured olive oil on Solomon's head to show that he would be their next king. They also poured oil on Zadok's head to show that he was their priest."
1 Chronicles,29,23,"So Solomon became king after David his father. Solomon was successful, and everyone in Israel obeyed him."
1 Chronicles,29,24,"Every official and every soldier, as well as all David's other sons, were loyal to him."
1 Chronicles,29,25,"The LORD made Solomon a great king, and the whole nation was amazed at how famous he was. In fact, no other king of Israel was as great as Solomon."
1 Chronicles,29,26,David the son of Jesse was king of Israel
1 Chronicles,29,27,for forty years. He ruled from Hebron for seven years and from Jerusalem for thirty-three years.
1 Chronicles,29,28,"David was rich and respected and lived to be an old man. Then he died, and his son Solomon became king."
1 Chronicles,29,29,"Everything David did while he was king is included in the history written by the prophets Samuel, Nathan, and Gad."
1 Chronicles,29,30,"They wrote about his powerful rule and about the things that happened not only to him, but also to Israel and the other nations."
