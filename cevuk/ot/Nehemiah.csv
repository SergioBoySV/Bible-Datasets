Nehemiah,1,1,"I am Nehemiah son of Hacaliah, and in this book I tell what I have done. During the month of Chislev in the twentieth year that Artaxerxes ruled Persia, I was in his fortress city of Susa,"
Nehemiah,1,2,when my brother Hanani came with some men from Judah. So I asked them about the Jews who had escaped from being captives in Babylonia. I also asked them about the city of Jerusalem.
Nehemiah,1,3,"They told me, “Those captives who have come back are having all kinds of troubles. They are terribly disgraced, Jerusalem's walls are broken down, and its gates have been burnt.”"
Nehemiah,1,4,"When I heard this, I sat down and cried. Then for several days, I mourned; I went without eating to show my sorrow, and I prayed:"
Nehemiah,1,5," LORD God of heaven, you are great and fearsome. And you faithfully keep your promises to everyone who loves you and obeys your commands."
Nehemiah,1,6,"I am your servant, so please have mercy on me and answer the prayer that I make day and night for these people of Israel who serve you. I, my family, and the rest of your people have sinned"
Nehemiah,1,7,by choosing to disobey you and the laws and teachings you gave to your servant Moses.
Nehemiah,1,8,"Please remember the promise you made to Moses. You told him that if we were unfaithful, you would scatter us among foreign nations."
Nehemiah,1,9,"But you also said that no matter how far away we were, we could turn to you and start obeying your laws. Then you would bring us back to the place where you have chosen to be worshipped."
Nehemiah,1,10,"Our LORD , I am praying for your servants—those you rescued by your great strength and mighty power."
Nehemiah,1,11,"Please answer my prayer and the prayer of your other servants who gladly honour your name. When I serve the king his wine today, make him pleased with me and let him do what I ask."
Nehemiah,2,1,"During the month of Nisan in the twentieth year that Artaxerxes was king, I served him his wine, as I had done before. But this was the first time I had ever looked depressed."
Nehemiah,2,2,"So the king said, “Why do you look so sad? You're not sick. Something must be bothering you.” Even though I was frightened,"
Nehemiah,2,3,"I answered, “Your Majesty, I hope you live for ever! I feel sad because the city where my ancestors are buried is in ruins, and its gates have been burnt down.”"
Nehemiah,2,4,"The king asked, “What do you want me to do?” I prayed to the God who rules from heaven."
Nehemiah,2,5,"Then I told the king, “Sir, if it's all right with you, please send me back to Judah, so that I can rebuild the city where my ancestors are buried.”"
Nehemiah,2,6,"The queen was sitting beside the king when he asked me, “How long will it take, and when will you be back?” The king agreed to let me go, and I told him when I would return."
Nehemiah,2,7,"Then I asked, “Your Majesty, would you be willing to give me letters to the governors of the provinces west of the River Euphrates, so that I can travel safely to Judah?"
Nehemiah,2,8,"I will need timber to rebuild the gates of the fortress near the temple and more timber to construct the city wall and to build a place for me to live. And so, I would appreciate a letter to Asaph, who is in charge of the royal forest.” God was good to me, and the king did everything I asked."
Nehemiah,2,9,"The king sent some army officers and cavalry troops along with me, and as I travelled through the Western Provinces, I gave the letters to the governors."
Nehemiah,2,10,"But when Sanballat from Horon and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about what had happened, they became very angry, because they didn't want anyone to help the people of Israel."
Nehemiah,2,11,"Three days after arriving in Jerusalem,"
Nehemiah,2,12,"I got up during the night and left my house. I took some men with me, without telling anyone what I thought God wanted me to do for the city. The only animal I took was the donkey I rode on."
Nehemiah,2,13,"I went through Valley Gate on the west, then south past Dragon Spring, before coming to Rubbish Gate. As I rode along, I took a good look at the crumbled walls of the city and the gates that had been torn down and burnt."
Nehemiah,2,14,"On the east side of the city, I headed north to Fountain Gate and King's Pool, but then the path became too narrow for my donkey."
Nehemiah,2,15,So I went down to Kidron Valley and looked at the wall from there. Then before daylight I returned to the city through Valley Gate.
Nehemiah,2,16,"None of the city officials knew what I had in mind. And I had not even told any of the Jews—not the priests, the leaders, the officials, or any other Jews who would be helping in the work."
Nehemiah,2,17,"But when I got back, I said to them, “Jerusalem is truly in a mess! The gates have been torn down and burnt, and everything is in ruins. We must rebuild the city wall so that we can again take pride in our city.”"
Nehemiah,2,18,"Then I told them how kind God had been and what the king had said. Immediately, they replied, “Let's start building now!” So they got everything ready."
Nehemiah,2,19,"When Sanballat, Tobiah, and Geshem the Arab heard about our plans, they started insulting us and saying, “Just look at you! Do you plan to rebuild the walls of the city and rebel against the king?”"
Nehemiah,2,20,"I answered, “We are servants of the God who rules from heaven, and he will make our work succeed. So we will start rebuilding Jerusalem, but you have no right to any of its property, because you have had no part in its history.”"
Nehemiah,3,1,These are the people who helped rebuild the wall and gates of Jerusalem: The high priest Eliashib and the other priests rebuilt Sheep Gate and hung its doors. Then they dedicated Sheep Gate and the section of the wall as far as Hundred Tower and Hananel Tower.
Nehemiah,3,2,"The people of Jericho rebuilt the next section of the wall, and Zaccur son of Imri rebuilt the section after that."
Nehemiah,3,3,"The family of Hassenaah built Fish Gate. They put the beams in place and hung the doors, then they added metal bolts and wooden beams as locks."
Nehemiah,3,4,"Meremoth, son of Uriah and grandson of Hakkoz, completed the next section of the wall. Meshullam, son of Berechiah and grandson of Meshezabel, rebuilt the next section, and Zadok son of Baana rebuilt the section beside that."
Nehemiah,3,5,"The next section was to be repaired by the men of Tekoa, but their town leaders refused to do the hard work they were assigned."
Nehemiah,3,6,"Joiada son of Paseah and Meshullam son of Besodeiah restored Ancient Gate. They put the beams in place, hung the doors, and added metal bolts and wooden beams as locks."
Nehemiah,3,7,"Melatiah from Gibeon, Jadon from Meronoth, and the men from Gibeon and Mizpah rebuilt the next section of the wall. This section reached as far as the house of the governor of West Euphrates Province."
Nehemiah,3,8,"Uzziel son of Harhaiah the goldsmith rebuilt the next section. Hananiah the perfume maker rebuilt the section next after that, and it went as far as Broad Wall."
Nehemiah,3,9,"Rephaiah son of Hur ruled half of the Jerusalem District, and he rebuilt the next section of the wall."
Nehemiah,3,10,"The section after that was close to the home of Jedaiah son of Harumaph, and he rebuilt it. Hattush son of Hashabneiah constructed the next section of the wall."
Nehemiah,3,11,"Malchijah son of Harim and Hasshub son of Pahath Moab rebuilt the section after that, and they also built Oven Tower."
Nehemiah,3,12,"Shallum son of Hallohesh ruled the other half of the Jerusalem District, and he rebuilt the next section of the wall. Shallum's daughters also worked with him."
Nehemiah,3,13,"Hanun and the people who lived in the town of Zanoah rebuilt Valley Gate. They hung the doors and added metal bolts and wooden beams as locks. They also rebuilt the wall for four hundred and forty metres, all the way to Rubbish Gate."
Nehemiah,3,14,"Malchijah son of Rechab ruled the district of Beth-Haccherem, and he rebuilt Rubbish Gate. He hung the doors and added metal bolts and wooden beams as locks."
Nehemiah,3,15,"Shallum son of Colhozeh ruled the district of Mizpah, and he rebuilt Fountain Gate. He put a cover over the gateway, then hung the doors and added metal bolts and wooden beams as locks. He also rebuilt the wall at Shelah Pool. This section was next to the king's garden and went as far as the stairs leading down from David's City."
Nehemiah,3,16,"Nehemiah son of Azbuk ruled half of the district of Beth-Zur, and he rebuilt the next section of the wall. It went as far as the royal cemetery, the artificial pool, and the army barracks."
Nehemiah,3,17,"The Levites who worked on the next sections of the wall were Rehum son of Bani; Hashabiah, who ruled half of the district of Keilah and did this work for his district;"
Nehemiah,3,18,"Binnui son of Henadad, who ruled the other half of the district of Keilah;"
Nehemiah,3,19,"Ezer son of Jeshua, who ruled Mizpah, rebuilt the section of the wall that was in front of the armoury and reached to the corner of the wall;"
Nehemiah,3,20,Baruch son of Zabbai eagerly rebuilt the section of the wall that went all the way to the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest;
Nehemiah,3,21,"Meremoth, son of Uriah and grandson of Hakkoz, built up to the far end of Eliashib's house."
Nehemiah,3,22,Here is a list of the priests who worked on the wall: Priests from the region around Jerusalem rebuilt the next section of the wall.
Nehemiah,3,23,"Benjamin and Hasshub rebuilt the wall in front of their own houses. Azariah, who was the son of Maaseiah and the grandson of Ananiah, rebuilt the section in front of his house."
Nehemiah,3,24,Binnui son of Henadad rebuilt the section of the wall from Azariah's house to the corner of the wall.
Nehemiah,3,25,"Palal son of Uzai rebuilt the next section, which began at the corner of the wall and the tower of the upper palace near the court of the guard. Pedaiah son of Parosh rebuilt the next section of the wall."
Nehemiah,3,26,"He stopped at a place near the Water Gate on the east and the tower guarding the temple. This was close to a section in the city called Ophel, where the temple workers lived."
Nehemiah,3,27,"The men from Tekoa rebuilt the next section of the wall, and it was their second section. It started at a place opposite the large tower that guarded the Temple, and it went all the way to the wall near Ophel."
Nehemiah,3,28,"Some priests rebuilt the next section of the wall. They began working north of Horse Gate, and each one worked on a section in front of his own house."
Nehemiah,3,29,"Zadok son of Immer rebuilt the wall in front of his house. Shemaiah son of Shecaniah, who looked after the East Gate, rebuilt the section after that."
Nehemiah,3,30,"Hananiah and Hanun rebuilt the next section, which was the second section for them. Meshullam son of Berechiah rebuilt the next section, which happened to be in front of his house."
Nehemiah,3,31,"Malchijah, a goldsmith, rebuilt the next section, as far as the house used by the temple workers and merchants. This area was opposite Gathering Gate, near the room on top of the wall at the north-east corner."
Nehemiah,3,32,"The goldsmiths and merchants rebuilt the last section of the wall, which went from the corner room all the way to Sheep Gate."
Nehemiah,4,1,"When Sanballat, the governor of Samaria, heard that we were rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem, he became angry and started insulting our people."
Nehemiah,4,2,"In front of his friends and the Samaritan army he said, “What is this feeble bunch of Jews trying to do? Are they going to rebuild the wall and offer sacrifices all in one day? Do they think they can make something out of this pile of scorched stones?”"
Nehemiah,4,3,"Tobiah from Ammon was standing beside Sanballat and said, “Look at the wall they are building! Why, even a fox could knock over this pile of stones.”"
Nehemiah,4,4,"But I prayed, “Our God, these people hate us and have wished horrible things for us. Please answer our prayers and make their insults fall on them! Let them be the ones to be dragged away as prisoners of war."
Nehemiah,4,5,Don't forgive the mean and evil way they have insulted the builders.”
Nehemiah,4,6,"The people worked hard, and we built the walls of Jerusalem halfway up again."
Nehemiah,4,7,"But Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the people from the city of Ashdod saw the walls going up and the holes being repaired. So they became angry"
Nehemiah,4,8,"and decided to stir up trouble, and to fight against the people of Jerusalem."
Nehemiah,4,9,"But we kept on praying to our God, and we also stationed guards day and night."
Nehemiah,4,10,"Meanwhile, the people of Judah were singing a sorrowful song: “So much rubble for us to haul! Worn out and weary, will we ever finish this wall?”"
Nehemiah,4,11,"Our enemies were saying, “Before those Jews know what has happened, we will sneak up and kill them and put an end to their work.”"
Nehemiah,4,12,"On at least ten different occasions, the Jews living near our enemies warned us against attacks from every side,"
Nehemiah,4,13,"and so I sent people to guard the wall at its lowest places and where there were still holes in it. I placed them according to families, and they stood guard with swords and spears and with bows and arrows."
Nehemiah,4,14,"Then I looked things over and told the leaders, the officials, and the rest of the people, “Don't be afraid of your enemies! The Lord is great and fearsome. So think of him and fight for your relatives and children, your wives and homes!”"
Nehemiah,4,15,"Our enemies found out that we knew about their plot against us, but God kept them from doing what they had planned. So we went back to work on the wall."
Nehemiah,4,16,"From then on, I let half of the young men work while the other half stood guard. They wore armour and had spears and shields, as well as bows and arrows. The leaders helped the workers"
Nehemiah,4,17,who were rebuilding the wall. Everyone who hauled building materials kept one hand free to carry a weapon.
Nehemiah,4,18,Even the workers who were rebuilding the wall strapped on a sword. The worker who was to blow the signal trumpet stayed with me.
Nehemiah,4,19,"I told the people and their officials and leaders, “Our work is so spread out, that we are a long way from one another."
Nehemiah,4,20,"If you hear the sound of the trumpet, come quickly and gather around me. Our God will help us fight.”"
Nehemiah,4,21,"Every day from dawn to dark, half of the workers rebuilt the walls, while the rest stood guard with their spears."
Nehemiah,4,22,I asked the men in charge and their workers to stay inside Jerusalem and stand guard at night. So they guarded the city at night and worked during the day.
Nehemiah,4,23,"I even slept in my work clothes at night; my children, the workers, and the guards slept in theirs as well. And we always kept our weapons close by."
Nehemiah,5,1,Some of the men and their wives complained about the Jews in power
Nehemiah,5,2,"and said, “We have large families, and it takes a lot of grain merely to keep them alive.”"
Nehemiah,5,3,"Others said, “During the famine we even had to mortgage our fields, vineyards, and homes to them in order to buy grain.”"
Nehemiah,5,4,"Then others said, “We had to borrow money from those in power to pay the government tax on our fields and vineyards."
Nehemiah,5,5,"We are Jews just as they are, and our children are as good as theirs. But we still have to sell our children as slaves, and some of our daughters have already been raped. We are completely helpless; our fields and vineyards have even been taken from us.”"
Nehemiah,5,6,"When I heard their complaints and their charges, I became very angry."
Nehemiah,5,7,"So I thought it over and said to the leaders and officials, “How can you charge your own people interest?” Then I called a public meeting and accused the leaders"
Nehemiah,5,8,"by saying, “We have tried to buy back all of our people who were sold into exile. But here you are, selling more of them for us to buy back!” The officials and leaders did not say a word, because they knew this was true."
Nehemiah,5,9,"I continued, “What you have done is wrong! We must honour our God by the way we live, so the Gentiles can't find fault with us."
Nehemiah,5,10,"My relatives, my friends, and I are also lending money and grain, but we must no longer demand payment in return."
Nehemiah,5,11,"Now give back the fields, vineyards, olive orchards, and houses you have taken and also the interest you have been paid.”"
Nehemiah,5,12,"The leaders answered, “We will do whatever you say and return their property, without asking to be repaid.” So I made the leaders promise in front of the priests to give back the property."
Nehemiah,5,13,"Then I emptied my pockets and said, “If you don't keep your promise, that's what God will do to you. He will empty out everything you own, even taking away your houses.” The people answered, “We will keep our promise.” Then they praised the LORD and did as they had promised."
Nehemiah,5,14,"I was governor of Judah from the twentieth year that Artaxerxes was king until the thirty-second year. And during these entire twelve years, my relatives and I refused to accept the food that I was allowed."
Nehemiah,5,15,"Each governor before me had been a burden to the people by making them pay for his food and wine and by demanding forty silver coins a day. Even their officials had been a burden to the people. But I respected God, and I didn't think it was right to be so hard on them."
Nehemiah,5,16,I spent all my time getting the wall rebuilt and did not buy any property. Everyone working for me did the same thing.
Nehemiah,5,17,"I usually fed a hundred and fifty of our own Jewish people and their leaders, as well as foreign visitors from surrounding lands."
Nehemiah,5,18,"Each day one ox, six of the best sheep, and lots of chickens were prepared. Then every ten days, a large supply of wine was brought in. I knew what a heavy burden this would have been for the people, and so I did not ask for my food allowance as governor."
Nehemiah,5,19,I pray that God will bless me for everything I have done for my people.
Nehemiah,6,1,"Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem, and our other enemies learnt that I had completely rebuilt the wall. All I lacked was hanging the doors in the gates."
Nehemiah,6,2,"Then Sanballat and Geshem sent a message, asking me to meet with them in one of the villages in Ono Valley. I knew they were planning to harm me in some way."
Nehemiah,6,3,"So I sent messengers to tell them, “My work is too important to stop now and go there. I can't afford to slow down the work just to visit you.”"
Nehemiah,6,4,"They invited me four times, but each time I refused to go."
Nehemiah,6,5,"Finally, Sanballat sent an official to me with an unsealed letter,"
Nehemiah,6,6,"which said: A rumour is going around among the nations that you and the other Jews are rebuilding the wall and planning to rebel, because you want to be their king. And Geshem says it's true!"
Nehemiah,6,7,"You even have prophets in Jerusalem, claiming you are now the king of Judah. You know the Persian king will hear about this, so let's get together and talk it over."
Nehemiah,6,8,"I sent a message back to Sanballat, saying, “None of this is true! You are making it all up.”"
Nehemiah,6,9,Our enemies were trying to frighten us and to keep us from our work. But I asked God to give me strength.
Nehemiah,6,10,"One day I went to visit Shemaiah. He was looking very worried, and he said, “Let's hurry to the holy place of the temple and hide there. We will lock the temple doors, because your enemies are planning to kill you tonight.”"
Nehemiah,6,11,"I answered, “Why should someone like me have to run and hide in the temple to save my life? I won't go!”"
Nehemiah,6,12,Suddenly I realized that God had not given Shemaiah this message. But Tobiah and Sanballat had paid him to trick me
Nehemiah,6,13,"and to frighten me into doing something wrong, because they wanted to ruin my good name."
Nehemiah,6,14,"Then I asked God to punish Tobiah and Sanballat for what they had done. I prayed that God would punish the prophet Noadiah and the other prophets who, together with her, had tried to frighten me."
Nehemiah,6,15,"On the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul, the wall was completely rebuilt. It had taken fifty-two days."
Nehemiah,6,16,"When our enemies in the surrounding nations learnt that the work was finished, they felt helpless, because they knew that our God had helped us rebuild the wall."
Nehemiah,6,17,All this time the Jewish leaders and Tobiah had been writing letters back and forth.
Nehemiah,6,18,"Many people in Judah were loyal to Tobiah for two reasons: Shecaniah son of Arah was his father-in-law, and Tobiah's son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berechiah."
Nehemiah,6,19,"The people would always tell me about the good things Tobiah had done, and then they would tell Tobiah everything I had said. So Tobiah kept sending letters, trying to frighten me."
Nehemiah,7,1,"After the wall had been rebuilt and the gates hung, then the temple guards, the singers, and the other Levites were assigned their work."
Nehemiah,7,2,"I put my brother Hanani in charge of Jerusalem, along with Hananiah, the commander of the fortress, because Hananiah could be trusted, and he respected God more than most people did."
Nehemiah,7,3,"I said to them, “Don't let the gates to the city be opened until the sun has been up for a while. And make sure that they are closed and barred before the guards go off duty at sunset. Choose people from Jerusalem to stand guard at different places around the wall and others to stand guard near their own houses.”"
Nehemiah,7,4,"Although Jerusalem covered a large area, not many people lived there, and no new houses had been built."
Nehemiah,9,1,"On the twenty-fourth day of the seventh month, the people of Israel went without eating, and they dressed in sackcloth and threw dust on their heads to show their sorrow."
Nehemiah,9,2,"They refused to let foreigners join them, as they met to confess their sins and the sins of their ancestors."
Nehemiah,9,3,"For three hours they stood and listened to the Law of the LORD their God, and then for the next three hours they confessed their sins and worshipped the LORD."
Nehemiah,9,4,"Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani stood on the special platform for the Levites and prayed aloud to the LORD their God."
Nehemiah,9,5,"Then the Levites Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah said: “Stand and shout praises to your LORD, the eternal God! Praise his wonderful name, though he is greater than words can express.”"
Nehemiah,9,6,"You alone are the LORD, Creator of the heavens and all the stars, Creator of the earth and those who live on it, Creator of the ocean and all its creatures. You are the source of life, praised by the stars that fill the heavens."
Nehemiah,9,7,"You are the LORD our God, the one who chose Abram— you brought him from Ur in Babylonia and named him Abraham."
Nehemiah,9,8,"Because he was faithful, you made an agreement to give his descendants the land of the Canaanites and Hittites, of the Amorites and Perizzites, and of the Jebusites and Girgashites. Now you have kept your promise, just as you always do."
Nehemiah,9,9,"When our ancestors were in Egypt, you saw their suffering; when they were at the Red Sea, you heard their cry for help."
Nehemiah,9,10,You knew that the King of Egypt and his officials and his nation had ill-treated your people. So you worked fearsome miracles against the Egyptians and earned a reputation that still remains.
Nehemiah,9,11,"You divided the deep sea, and your people walked through on dry land. But you tossed their enemies in, and they sank down like a heavy stone."
Nehemiah,9,12,"Each day you led your people with a thick cloud, and at night you showed the way with a flaming fire."
Nehemiah,9,13,"At Sinai you came down from heaven, and you gave your people good laws and teachings that are fair and honest."
Nehemiah,9,14,"You commanded them to respect your holy Sabbath, and you instructed your servant Moses to teach them your laws."
Nehemiah,9,15,"When they were hungry, you sent bread from heaven, and when they were thirsty, you let water flow from a rock. Then you commanded them to capture the land that you had solemnly promised."
Nehemiah,10,1,"As governor, I signed the agreement together with Zedekiah and the following priests:"
Nehemiah,11,1,"The nation's leaders and their families settled in Jerusalem. But there was room for only one out of every ten of the remaining families, and so they asked God to show them who would live there."
Nehemiah,11,2,Then everyone else asked God to bless those who were willing to live in Jerusalem.
Nehemiah,11,3,"Some of the people of Israel, the priests, the Levites, the temple workers, and the descendants of Solomon's servants lived on their own property in the towns of Judah. But the leaders of the province lived in Jerusalem with their families."
Nehemiah,12,1,"Many priests and Levites had returned from Babylonia with Zerubbabel and Joshua as their leaders. Those priests were Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,"
Nehemiah,12,2,"Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,"
Nehemiah,12,3,"Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,"
Nehemiah,12,4,"Iddo, Ginnethoi, Abijah,"
Nehemiah,12,5,"Mijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah,"
Nehemiah,12,6,"Shemaiah, Joiarib, Jedaiah,"
Nehemiah,12,7,"Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, and another Jedaiah. These were the leading priests and their assistants during the time of Joshua."
Nehemiah,12,8,"The Levites who returned were Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah. They and their assistants were responsible for the songs of praise,"
Nehemiah,12,9,"while Bakbukiah and Unno, together with their assistants, were responsible for the choral responses."
Nehemiah,12,10,"Joshua was the father of Joiakim, the grandfather of Eliashib, and the great-grandfather of Joiada."
Nehemiah,12,11,Joiada was the father of Jonathan and the grandfather of Jaddua.
Nehemiah,12,12,"When Joiakim was high priest, the following priests were leaders of their clans: Meraiah of the Seraiah clan, Hananiah of Jeremiah,"
Nehemiah,12,13,"Meshullam of Ezra, Jehohanan of Amariah,"
Nehemiah,12,14,"Jonathan of Malluchi, Joseph of Shebaniah,"
Nehemiah,12,15,"Adna of Harim, Helkai of Meraioth,"
Nehemiah,12,16,"Zechariah of Iddo, Meshullam of Ginnethon,"
Nehemiah,12,17,"Zichri of Abijah, Piltai of Moadiah,"
Nehemiah,12,18,"Shammua of Bilgah, Jehonathan of Shemaiah,"
Nehemiah,12,19,"Mattenai of Joiarib, Uzzi of Jedaiah,"
Nehemiah,12,20,"Kallai of Sallai, Eber of Amok,"
Nehemiah,12,21,"Hashabiah of Hilkiah, and Nethanel of Jedaiah."
Nehemiah,12,22,"During the time of the high priests Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua, and including the time that Darius was king of Persia, a record was kept of the heads of the Levite and priestly families."
Nehemiah,12,23,"However, no official record was kept of the heads of the Levite clans after the death of Johanan, the grandson of Eliashib."
Nehemiah,12,24,"Hashabiah, Sherebiah, Jeshua son of Kadmiel, and their assistants organized two choirs of Levites to offer praises to God, just as King David, the man of God, had commanded."
Nehemiah,12,25,"Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were responsible for guarding the storerooms near the temple gates."
Nehemiah,12,26,"All these men lived during the time of Joiakim and during the time that I was governor and Ezra, a teacher of the Law of Moses, was priest."
Nehemiah,12,27,"When the city wall was dedicated, Levites from everywhere in Judah were invited to join in the celebration with songs of praise and with the music of cymbals, small harps, and other stringed instruments."
Nehemiah,13,1,"On that day when the Law of Moses was read aloud to everyone, it was discovered that Ammonites and Moabites were forbidden to belong to the people of God."
Nehemiah,13,2,"This was because they had refused to give food and water to Israel and had hired Balaam to call down a curse on them. However, our God turned the curse into a blessing."
Nehemiah,13,3,"Following the reading of the Law of Moses, the people of Israel started sending away anyone who had any foreign ancestors."
Nehemiah,13,4,The priest Eliashib was a relative of Tobiah and had earlier been put in charge of the temple storerooms.
Nehemiah,13,5,"So he let Tobiah live in one of these rooms, where all kinds of things had been stored—the grain offerings, incense, utensils for the temple, as well as the tenth of the grain, wine, and olive oil that had been given for the use of the Levites, singers, and temple guards, and the gifts for the priests."
Nehemiah,13,6,"This happened in the thirty-second year that Artaxerxes ruled Babylonia. I was away from Jerusalem at the time, because I was visiting him. Later I received permission from the king"
Nehemiah,13,7,to return to Jerusalem. Only then did I find out that Eliashib had done this terrible thing of letting Tobiah have a room in the temple.
Nehemiah,13,8,It upset me so much that I threw out every bit of Tobiah's furniture.
Nehemiah,13,9,"Then I ordered the room to be cleaned and the temple utensils, the grain offerings, and the incense to be brought back into the room."
Nehemiah,13,10,"I also found out that the temple singers and several other Levites had returned to work on their farms, because they had not been given their share of the harvest."
Nehemiah,13,11,"I called the leaders together and angrily asked them, “Why is the temple neglected?” Then I told them to start doing their jobs."
Nehemiah,13,12,"After this, everyone in Judah brought a tenth of their grain, wine, and olive oil to the temple storeroom."
Nehemiah,13,13,"Finally, I appointed three men with good reputations to be in charge of what was brought there and to distribute it to the others. They were Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the teacher of the Law, and Pedaiah the Levite. Their assistant was Hanan, the son of Zaccur and the grandson of Mattaniah."
Nehemiah,13,14,I pray that my God will remember these good things that I have done for his temple and for those who worship there.
