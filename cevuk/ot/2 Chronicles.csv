2 Chronicles,1,1,"King Solomon, the son of David, was now in complete control of his kingdom, because the LORD God had blessed him and made him a powerful king."
2 Chronicles,2,1,"Solomon decided to build a temple where the LORD would be worshipped, and also to build a palace for himself."
2 Chronicles,2,2,He assigned seventy thousand men to carry building supplies and eighty thousand to cut stone from the hills. And he chose three thousand six hundred men to supervise these workers.
2 Chronicles,2,3,"Solomon sent the following message to King Hiram of Tyre: Years ago, when my father David was building his palace, you supplied him with cedar logs. Now will you send me supplies?"
2 Chronicles,2,4,"I am building a temple where the LORD my God will be worshipped. Sweet-smelling incense will be burnt there, and sacred bread will be offered to him. Worshippers will offer sacrifices to the LORD every morning and evening, every Sabbath, and on the first day of each month, as well as during all our religious festivals. These things will be done for all time, just as the LORD has commanded."
2 Chronicles,2,5,"This will be a great temple, because our God is greater than all other gods."
2 Chronicles,2,6,No one can ever build a temple large enough for God—even the heavens are too small a place for him to live in! All I can do is build a place where we can offer sacrifices to him.
2 Chronicles,2,7,"Send me a worker who can not only carve, but who can work with gold, silver, bronze, and iron, as well as make brightly-coloured cloth. The person you send will work here in Judah and Jerusalem with the skilled workers that my father has already hired."
2 Chronicles,2,8,"I know that you have workers who are experts at cutting timber in Lebanon. So would you please send me some cedar, pine, and juniper logs? My workers will be there to help them,"
2 Chronicles,2,9,because I'll need a lot of timber to build such a large and glorious temple.
2 Chronicles,2,10,"I will pay your woodcutters two thousand tonnes of wheat, the same amount of barley, four hundred thousand litres of wine, and that same amount of olive oil."
2 Chronicles,2,11,"Hiram sent his answer back to Solomon: I know that the LORD must love his people, because he has chosen you to be their king."
2 Chronicles,2,12,"Praise the LORD God of Israel who made heaven and earth! He has given David a son who is not only wise and clever, but who has the knowledge to build a temple for the LORD and a palace for himself."
2 Chronicles,2,13,I am sending Huram Abi to you. He is very bright.
2 Chronicles,2,14,"His mother was from the Israelite tribe of Dan, and his father was from Tyre. Not only is Huram an expert at working with gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone, and wood, but he can also make coloured cloth and fine linen. And he can carve anything if you give him a pattern to follow. He can help your workers and those hired by your father King David."
2 Chronicles,2,15,"Go ahead and send the wheat, barley, olive oil, and wine you promised to pay my workers."
2 Chronicles,2,16,"I will tell them to start cutting down trees in Lebanon. They will cut as many as you need, then tie them together into rafts, and float them down along the coast to Joppa. Your workers can take them to Jerusalem from there."
2 Chronicles,2,17,"Solomon counted all the foreigners who were living in Israel, just as his father David had done when he was king, and the total was 153,600."
2 Chronicles,2,18,"He assigned 70,000 of them to carry building supplies and 80,000 of them to cut stone from the hills. He chose 3,600 others to supervise the workers and to make sure the work was completed."
2 Chronicles,4,1,Solomon had a bronze altar made that was nine metres square and four and a half metres high.
2 Chronicles,4,2,"He also gave orders to make a large metal bowl called the Sea. It was four and a half metres across, just over two metres deep, and thirteen and a half metres around."
2 Chronicles,4,3,"Its outer edge was decorated with two rows of carvings of bulls, ten bulls to about every forty-five centimetres, all made from the same piece of metal as the bowl."
2 Chronicles,4,4,"The bowl itself sat on top of twelve bronze bulls, with three bulls facing outwards in each of four directions."
2 Chronicles,4,5,"The sides of the bowl were seventy-five millimetres thick, and its rim was in the shape of a cup that curved outwards like flower petals. The bowl held about sixty thousand litres."
2 Chronicles,4,6,"He also made ten small bowls and put five on each side of the large bowl. The small bowls were used to wash the animals that were burnt on the altar as sacrifices, and the priests used the water in the large bowl to wash their hands."
2 Chronicles,4,7,"Ten gold lampstands were also made according to the plans. Solomon placed these lampstands inside the temple, five on each side of the main room."
2 Chronicles,4,8,"He also made ten tables and placed them in the main room, five on each side. And he made a hundred small gold sprinkling bowls."
2 Chronicles,4,9,Solomon gave orders to build two courtyards: a smaller one that only priests could use and a larger one. The doors to these courtyards were covered with bronze.
2 Chronicles,4,10,The large bowl called the Sea was placed near the south-east corner of the temple.
2 Chronicles,4,11,"Huram made shovels, sprinkling bowls, and pans for hot ashes. Here is a list of the other furnishings he made for God's temple:"
2 Chronicles,4,12,"two columns, two bowl-shaped caps for the tops of these columns, two chain designs on the caps,"
2 Chronicles,4,13,"four hundred pomegranates for the chain designs,"
2 Chronicles,4,14,"the stands and the small bowls,"
2 Chronicles,4,15,"the large bowl and the twelve bulls that held it up,"
2 Chronicles,4,16,"pans for hot ashes, as well as shovels and meat forks. Huram made all these things out of polished bronze"
2 Chronicles,4,17,"by pouring melted bronze into the clay moulds he had set up near the River Jordan, between Succoth and Zeredah."
2 Chronicles,4,18,There were so many bronze furnishings that no one ever knew how much bronze it took to make them.
2 Chronicles,4,19,"Solomon also gave orders to make the following temple furnishings out of gold: the altar, the tables that held the sacred loaves of bread,"
2 Chronicles,4,20,"the lampstands and the lamps that burnt in front of the most holy place,"
2 Chronicles,4,21,"flower designs, lamps and tongs,"
2 Chronicles,4,22,"lamp snuffers, small sprinkling bowls, ladles, fire pans, and the doors to the most holy place and the main room of the temple."
2 Chronicles,5,1,"After the LORD 's temple was finished, Solomon put in its storage rooms everything that his father David had dedicated to the LORD , including the gold and silver, and the objects used in worship."
2 Chronicles,6,1,"Solomon prayed: “Our LORD , you said that you would live in a dark cloud."
2 Chronicles,6,2,Now I've built a glorious temple where you can live for ever.”
2 Chronicles,6,3,Solomon turned towards the people standing there. Then he blessed them
2 Chronicles,7,1,"As soon as Solomon finished praying, fire came down from heaven and burnt up the offerings. The LORD 's dazzling glory then filled the temple,"
2 Chronicles,7,2,and the priests could not go in.
2 Chronicles,7,3,"When the crowd of people saw the fire and the LORD 's glory, they knelt down and worshipped the LORD . They prayed: “The LORD is good, and his love never ends.”"
2 Chronicles,8,1,It took twenty years for the LORD 's temple and Solomon's palace to be built.
2 Chronicles,8,2,"After that, Solomon's workers rebuilt the towns that Hiram had given him. Then Solomon sent Israelites to live in those towns."
2 Chronicles,8,3,Solomon attacked and captured the town of Hamath-Zobah.
2 Chronicles,8,4,He made his workers build the town of Tadmor in the desert and some towns in Hamath where he could keep his supplies.
2 Chronicles,8,5,He strengthened Upper Beth-Horon and Lower Beth-Horon by adding walls and gates that could be locked.
2 Chronicles,8,6,"He did the same thing to the town of Baalath and to the cities where he kept supplies, chariots, and horses. Solomon made his workers build whatever he wanted in Jerusalem, Lebanon, and anywhere else in his kingdom."
2 Chronicles,9,1,"The Queen of Sheba heard how famous Solomon was, so she went to Jerusalem to test him with difficult questions. She took along several of her officials, and she loaded her camels with gifts of spices, jewels, and gold. When she arrived, she and Solomon talked about everything she could think of."
2 Chronicles,9,2,"He answered every question, no matter how difficult it was."
2 Chronicles,10,1,Rehoboam went to Shechem where everyone was waiting to crown him king.
2 Chronicles,10,2,"Jeroboam son of Nebat heard what was happening, and he returned from Egypt, where he had gone to hide from Solomon."
2 Chronicles,10,3,"The people from the northern tribes of Israel sent for him. Then together they went to Rehoboam and said,"
2 Chronicles,10,4,"“Your father Solomon forced us to work very hard. But if you make our work easier, we will serve you and do whatever you ask.”"
2 Chronicles,10,5,"Rehoboam replied, “Come back in three days for my answer.” So the people left."
2 Chronicles,10,6,"Rehoboam went to some leaders who had been his father's senior officials, and he asked them, “What should I tell these people?”"
2 Chronicles,10,7,"They answered, “If you want them to serve and obey you, then you should be kind and promise to make their work easier.”"
2 Chronicles,10,8,But Rehoboam refused their advice and went to the younger men who had grown up with him and were now his officials.
2 Chronicles,10,9,"He asked, “What do you think I should say to these people who asked me to make their work easier?”"
2 Chronicles,10,10,"His younger advisers said: Here's what we think you should say to them: “Compared to me, my father was weak."
2 Chronicles,10,11,"He made you work hard, but I'll make you work even harder. He punished you with whips, but I'll use whips with pieces of sharp metal!”"
2 Chronicles,10,12,"Three days later, Jeroboam and the others came back."
2 Chronicles,10,13,Rehoboam ignored the advice of the older advisers. He spoke bluntly
2 Chronicles,10,14,"and told them exactly what his own advisers had suggested. He said: “My father made you work hard, but I'll make you work even harder. He punished you with whips, but I'll use whips with pieces of sharp metal!”"
2 Chronicles,11,1,"After Rehoboam returned to Jerusalem, he decided to attack Israel and regain control of the whole country. So he called together one hundred and eighty thousand soldiers from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin."
2 Chronicles,11,2,"Meanwhile, the LORD had told Shemaiah the prophet"
2 Chronicles,11,3,"to tell Rehoboam and everyone from Judah and Benjamin,"
2 Chronicles,11,4,“The LORD warns you not to go to war against the people from the northern tribes—they are your relatives. Go home! The LORD is the one who made these things happen.” Rehoboam and his army obeyed the LORD 's message and did not attack Jeroboam and his troops.
2 Chronicles,11,5,"Rehoboam ruled from Jerusalem, and he had several cities in Judah turned into fortresses so he could use them to defend his country. These cities included"
2 Chronicles,11,6,"Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa,"
2 Chronicles,11,7,"Beth-Zur, Soco, Adullam,"
2 Chronicles,11,8,"Gath, Mareshah, Ziph,"
2 Chronicles,11,9,"Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah,"
2 Chronicles,11,10,"Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron. After he had fortified these cities in the territories of Judah and Benjamin,"
2 Chronicles,11,11,"he assigned an army commander to each of them and stocked them with supplies of food, olive oil, and wine,"
2 Chronicles,11,12,as well as with shields and spears. He used these fortified cities to keep control of Judah and Benjamin.
2 Chronicles,11,13,The priests and Levites from the northern tribes of Israel gave their support to King Rehoboam.
2 Chronicles,11,14,"And since Jeroboam and the kings of Israel who followed him would not allow any Levites to serve as priests, most Levites left their towns and pasture lands in Israel and moved to Jerusalem and other towns in Judah."
2 Chronicles,11,15,Jeroboam chose his own priests to serve at the local shrines in Israel and at the places of worship where he had set up statues of goat-demons and of calves.
2 Chronicles,11,16,"But some of the people from Israel wanted to worship the LORD God, just as their ancestors had done. So they followed the priests and Levites to Jerusalem, where they could offer sacrifices to the LORD."
2 Chronicles,11,17,"For the next three years, they lived in Judah and were loyal to Rehoboam and his kingdom, just as they had been loyal to David and Solomon."
2 Chronicles,11,18,"Rehoboam married Mahalath, whose father was Jerimoth son of David, and whose mother was Abihail the daughter of Eliab and granddaughter of Jesse."
2 Chronicles,11,19,"Rehoboam and Mahalath had three sons: Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham."
2 Chronicles,11,20,"Then Rehoboam married Maacah the daughter of Absalom. Their sons were Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith."
2 Chronicles,11,21,"Rehoboam had eighteen wives, but he also married sixty other women, and he was the father of twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters. Rehoboam loved his wife Maacah the most,"
2 Chronicles,11,22,so he chose their eldest son Abijah to be the next king.
2 Chronicles,11,23,Rehoboam was wise enough to put one of his sons in charge of each fortified city in his kingdom. He gave them all the supplies they needed and found wives for every one of them.
2 Chronicles,12,1,"Soon after Rehoboam had control of his kingdom, he and everyone in Judah stopped obeying the LORD."
2 Chronicles,12,2,"So in the fifth year of Rehoboam's rule, the LORD punished them for their unfaithfulness and allowed King Shishak of Egypt to invade Judah."
2 Chronicles,12,3,"Shishak attacked with his army of one thousand two hundred chariots and sixty thousand cavalry troops, as well as Egyptian soldiers from Libya, Sukkoth, and Ethiopia."
2 Chronicles,12,4,He captured every one of the fortified cities in Judah and then marched to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,12,5,"Rehoboam and the leaders of Judah had gone to Jerusalem to escape Shishak's invasion. And while they were there, Shemaiah the prophet told them, “The LORD says that because you have disobeyed him, he has now abandoned you. The LORD will not help you against Shishak!”"
2 Chronicles,12,6,"Rehoboam and the leaders were sorry for what they had done and admitted, “The LORD is right. We have deserted him.”"
2 Chronicles,12,7,"When the LORD heard this, he told Shemaiah: The people of Judah are truly sorry for their sins, and so I won't let Shishak completely destroy them. But because I am still angry,"
2 Chronicles,12,8,he will conquer and rule them. Then my people will know what it's like to serve a foreign king instead of serving me.
2 Chronicles,12,9,"Shishak attacked Jerusalem and took all the valuable things from the temple and from the palace, including Solomon's gold shields."
2 Chronicles,12,10,"Rehoboam had bronze shields made to replace the gold ones, and he ordered the guards at the city gates to keep them safe."
2 Chronicles,12,11,"Whenever Rehoboam went to the LORD 's temple, the guards carried the shields. But they always took them back to the guardroom as soon as he had finished worshipping."
2 Chronicles,12,12,"Rehoboam turned back to the LORD , and so the LORD did not let Judah be completely destroyed, and Judah was prosperous again."
2 Chronicles,12,13,"Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king, and he ruled seventeen years from Jerusalem, the city where the LORD had chosen to be worshipped. His mother Naamah was from Ammon. Rehoboam was a powerful king,"
2 Chronicles,12,14,but he still did wrong and refused to obey the LORD.
2 Chronicles,12,15,"Everything else Rehoboam did while he was king, including a history of his family, is written in the records of the two prophets, Shemaiah and Iddo. During Rehoboam's rule, he and King Jeroboam of Israel were constantly at war."
2 Chronicles,12,16,"When Rehoboam died, he was buried beside his ancestors in Jerusalem, and his son Abijah became king."
2 Chronicles,13,1,"Abijah became king of Judah in Jeroboam's eighteenth year as king of Israel,"
2 Chronicles,13,2,"and he ruled from Jerusalem for three years. His mother was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel from Gibeah. Some time later, Abijah and King Jeroboam of Israel went to war against each other."
2 Chronicles,13,3,"Abijah's army had four hundred thousand troops, and Jeroboam met him in battle with eight hundred thousand troops."
2 Chronicles,13,4,"Abijah went to the top of Mount Zemaraim in the hills of Ephraim and shouted: Listen, Jeroboam and all you Israelites!"
2 Chronicles,13,5,The LORD God of Israel has made a solemn promise that every king of Israel will be from David's family.
2 Chronicles,13,6,"But Jeroboam, you were King Solomon's official, and you rebelled."
2 Chronicles,13,7,"Then straight after Rehoboam became king, you and your bunch of worthless followers challenged Rehoboam, who was too young to know how to stop you."
2 Chronicles,13,8,Now you and your powerful army think you can stand up to the kingdom that the LORD has given to David's descendants. The only gods you have are those gold statues of calves that Jeroboam made for you.
2 Chronicles,13,9,"You don't even have descendants of Aaron on your side, because you forced out the LORD 's priests and Levites. In their place, you appoint ordinary people to be priests, just as the foreign nations do. In fact, anyone who brings a bull and seven rams to the altar can become a priest of your so called gods."
2 Chronicles,13,10,"But we have not turned our backs on the LORD God! Aaron's own descendants serve as our priests, and the Levites are their assistants."
2 Chronicles,13,11,"Twice every day they offer sacrifices and burn incense to the LORD . They set out the sacred loaves of bread on a table that has been purified, and they light the lamps in the gold lampstand every day at sunset. We follow the commands of the LORD our God—you have rejected him!"
2 Chronicles,13,12,"That's why God is on our side and will lead us into battle when the priests sound the signal on the trumpets. It's no use, Israelites. You might as well give up. There's no way you can defeat the LORD , the God your ancestors worshipped."
2 Chronicles,13,13,"But while Abijah was talking, Jeroboam had sent some of his troops to attack Judah's army from behind, while the rest attacked from the front."
2 Chronicles,13,14,"Judah's army realized they were trapped, and so they prayed to the LORD . The priests blew the signal on the trumpet,"
2 Chronicles,13,15,"and the troops let out a battle cry. Then with Abijah leading them into battle, God defeated Jeroboam and Israel's army."
2 Chronicles,13,16,"The Israelites ran away, and God helped Judah's soldiers slaughter"
2 Chronicles,13,17,five hundred thousand enemy troops.
2 Chronicles,13,18,Judah's army won because they had trusted the LORD God of their ancestors.
2 Chronicles,13,19,"Abijah kept up his attack on Jeroboam's army and captured the Israelite towns of Bethel, Jeshanah, and Ephron, as well as the villages around them."
2 Chronicles,13,20,"Jeroboam never regained his power during the rest of Abijah's rule. The LORD punished Jeroboam, and he died, but Abijah became more powerful."
2 Chronicles,13,21,"Abijah had a total of fourteen wives, twenty-two sons, and sixteen daughters."
2 Chronicles,13,22,Everything Abijah said and did while he was king is written in the records of Iddo the prophet.
2 Chronicles,14,1,"Abijah died and was buried in Jerusalem. Then his son Asa became king, and Judah had ten years of peace."
2 Chronicles,14,2,Asa obeyed the LORD his God and did right.
2 Chronicles,14,3,He destroyed the local shrines and the altars to foreign gods. He smashed the stone images of gods and cut down the sacred poles used in worshipping the goddess Asherah.
2 Chronicles,14,4,"Then he told everyone in Judah to worship the LORD God, just as their ancestors had done, and to obey his laws and teachings."
2 Chronicles,14,5,He destroyed every local shrine and incense altar in Judah.
2 Chronicles,14,6,"The LORD blessed Judah with peace while Asa was king, and so during that time, Asa fortified many of the towns."
2 Chronicles,14,7,"He said to the people, “Let's build walls and defence towers for these towns, and put in gates that can be locked with bars. This land still belongs to us, because we have obeyed the LORD our God. He has given us peace from all our enemies.” The people did everything Asa had suggested."
2 Chronicles,14,8,Asa had a large army of brave soldiers: three hundred thousand of them were from the tribe of Judah and were armed with shields and spears; two hundred and eighty thousand were from Benjamin and were armed with bows and arrows.
2 Chronicles,14,9,Zerah from Ethiopia led an army of a million soldiers and three hundred chariots to the town of Mareshah in Judah.
2 Chronicles,14,10,"Asa met him there, and the two armies prepared for battle in Zephathah Valley."
2 Chronicles,14,11,"Asa prayed: LORD God, only you can help a powerless army defeat a stronger one. So we depend on you to help us. We will fight against this powerful army to honour your name, and we know that you won't be defeated. You are the LORD our God."
2 Chronicles,14,12,"The LORD helped Asa and his army defeat the Ethiopians. The enemy soldiers ran away,"
2 Chronicles,14,13,but Asa and his troops chased them as far as Gerar. It was a total defeat—the Ethiopians could not even fight back! The soldiers from Judah took everything that had belonged to the Ethiopians.
2 Chronicles,14,14,The people who lived in the villages around Gerar learnt what had happened and were afraid of the LORD . So Judah's army easily defeated them and carried off everything of value that they wanted from these towns.
2 Chronicles,14,15,"They also attacked the camps where the shepherds lived and took a lot of sheep, goats, and camels. Then they went back to Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,15,1,"Some time later, God spoke to Azariah son of Oded."
2 Chronicles,15,2,"At once, Azariah went to Asa and said: Listen to me, King Asa and you people of Judah and Benjamin. The LORD will be with you and help you, as long as you obey and worship him. But if you disobey him, he will desert you."
2 Chronicles,15,3,"For a long time, the people of Israel did not worship the true God or listen to priests who could teach them about God. They refused to obey God's Law."
2 Chronicles,15,4,"But whenever trouble came, Israel turned back to the LORD their God and worshipped him."
2 Chronicles,15,5,There was so much confusion in those days that it wasn't safe to go anywhere in Israel.
2 Chronicles,15,6,"Nations were destroying each other, and cities were wiping out other cities, because God was causing trouble and unrest everywhere."
2 Chronicles,15,7,So you must be brave. Don't give up! God will honour you for obeying him.
2 Chronicles,15,8,"As soon as Asa heard what Azariah the prophet said, he gave orders for all the idols in Judah and Benjamin to be destroyed, including those in the towns he had captured in the territory of Ephraim. He also repaired the LORD 's altar that was in front of the temple porch."
2 Chronicles,15,9,"Asa called together the people from Judah and Benjamin, as well as the people from the territories of Ephraim, West Manasseh, and Simeon who were living in Judah. Many of these people were now loyal to Asa, because they had seen that the LORD was with him."
2 Chronicles,15,10,"In the third month of the fifteenth year of Asa's rule, they all met in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,15,11,"That same day, they took seven hundred bulls and seven thousand sheep and goats from what they had brought back from Gerar and sacrificed them as offerings to the LORD."
2 Chronicles,15,12,"They made a solemn promise to faithfully worship the LORD God their ancestors had worshipped,"
2 Chronicles,15,13,and to put to death anyone who refused to obey him.
2 Chronicles,15,14,"The crowd solemnly agreed to keep their promise to the LORD , then they celebrated by shouting and blowing trumpets and horns."
2 Chronicles,15,15,"Everyone was happy because they had made this solemn promise, and in return, the LORD blessed them with peace from all their enemies."
2 Chronicles,15,16,"Asa's grandmother Maacah had made a disgusting idol of the goddess Asherah, so he cut it down, crushed it, and burnt it in Kidron Valley. Then he removed Maacah from her position as queen mother."
2 Chronicles,15,17,"As long as Asa lived, he was faithful to the LORD , even though he did not destroy the local shrines in Israel."
2 Chronicles,15,18,He placed in the temple all the silver and gold objects that he and his father had dedicated to God.
2 Chronicles,15,19,There was peace in Judah until the thirty-fifth year of Asa's rule.
2 Chronicles,16,1,"In the thirty-sixth year of Asa's rule, King Baasha of Israel invaded Judah and captured the town of Ramah. He started making the town stronger, and he put troops there to stop people from going in and out of Judah."
2 Chronicles,16,2,"When Asa heard about this, he took the silver and gold from his palace and from the LORD 's temple. Then he sent it to Damascus with this message for King Benhadad of Syria:"
2 Chronicles,16,3,"“I think we should sign a peace treaty, just as our fathers did. This silver and gold is a present for you. Would you please break your treaty with King Baasha of Israel and force him to leave my country?”"
2 Chronicles,16,4,"Benhadad did what Asa asked and sent the Syrian army into Israel. They captured the towns of Ijon, Dan, Abel-Maim, and all the towns in Naphtali where supplies were kept."
2 Chronicles,16,5,"When Baasha heard about it, he stopped his work on the town of Ramah."
2 Chronicles,16,6,Asa ordered everyone in Judah to carry away the stones and wood Baasha had used to fortify Ramah. Then he fortified the towns of Geba and Mizpah with these same stones and wood.
2 Chronicles,16,7,"Soon after that happened, Hanani the prophet went to Asa and said: You depended on the king of Syria instead of depending on the LORD your God. And so, you will never defeat the Syrian army."
2 Chronicles,16,8,"Remember how powerful the Ethiopian and Libyan army was, with all their chariots and cavalry troops! You trusted the LORD to help you then, and you defeated them."
2 Chronicles,16,9,"The LORD is constantly watching everyone, and he gives strength to those who faithfully obey him. But you have done a foolish thing, and your kingdom will never be at peace again."
2 Chronicles,16,10,"When Asa heard this, he was so angry that he put Hanani in prison. Asa was also cruel to some of his people."
2 Chronicles,16,11,Everything Asa did while he was king is written in The History of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
2 Chronicles,16,12,"In the thirty-ninth year of his rule, he got a very bad foot disease, but he relied on doctors and refused to ask the LORD for help."
2 Chronicles,16,13,He died two years later.
2 Chronicles,16,14,"Earlier, Asa had his own tomb cut out of a rock hill in Jerusalem. So he was buried there, and the tomb was filled with spices and sweet-smelling oils. Then the people built a bonfire in his honour."
2 Chronicles,17,1,Jehoshaphat son of Asa became king and strengthened his defences against Israel.
2 Chronicles,17,2,"He assigned troops to the fortified cities in Judah, as well as to other towns in Judah and to those towns in Ephraim that his father Asa had captured."
2 Chronicles,18,1,Jehoshaphat was now very rich and famous. He signed a treaty with King Ahab of Israel by arranging the marriage of his son and Ahab's daughter.
2 Chronicles,18,2,"One day, Jehoshaphat went to visit Ahab in his capital city of Samaria. Ahab slaughtered sheep and cattle and prepared a big feast to honour Jehoshaphat and the officials with him. Ahab talked about attacking the city of Ramoth in Gilead,"
2 Chronicles,18,3,"and finally asked, “Jehoshaphat, would you go with me to attack Ramoth?” “Yes,” Jehoshaphat answered. “My army is at your command."
2 Chronicles,18,4,But first let's ask the LORD what to do.”
2 Chronicles,18,5,"Ahab sent for four hundred prophets and asked, “Should I attack the city of Ramoth?” “Yes!” the prophets answered. “God will help you capture the city.”"
2 Chronicles,18,6,"But Jehoshaphat said, “Just to make sure, is there another of the LORD 's prophets we can ask?”"
2 Chronicles,18,7,"“We could ask Micaiah son of Imlah,” Ahab said. “But I hate Micaiah. He always has bad news for me.” “Don't say that!” Jehoshaphat replied."
2 Chronicles,18,8,Then Ahab sent someone to bring Micaiah as soon as possible.
2 Chronicles,18,9,"All this time, Ahab and Jehoshaphat were dressed in their royal robes and were seated on their thrones at the threshing place near the gate of Samaria, listening to the prophets tell them what the LORD had said."
2 Chronicles,18,10,"Zedekiah son of Chenaanah was one of the prophets. He had made some horns out of iron and shouted, “Ahab, the LORD says you will attack the Syrians like a bull with iron horns and wipe them out!”"
2 Chronicles,18,11,All the prophets agreed that Ahab should attack the Syrians at Ramoth and promised that the LORD would help him defeat them.
2 Chronicles,18,12,"Meanwhile, the messenger who went to get Micaiah whispered, “Micaiah, all the prophets have good news for Ahab. Now go and say the same thing.”"
2 Chronicles,18,13,"“I'll say whatever the living LORD my God tells me to say,” Micaiah replied."
2 Chronicles,18,14,"Then Micaiah went up to Ahab, who asked, “Micaiah, should we attack Ramoth?” “Yes!” Micaiah answered. “The LORD will help you capture the city.”"
2 Chronicles,18,15,"Ahab shouted, “Micaiah, I've told you over and over again to tell me the truth! What does the LORD really say?”"
2 Chronicles,18,16,"Micaiah answered, “In a vision I saw Israelite soldiers wandering around, lost in the hills like sheep without a shepherd. The LORD said, ‘These troops have no leader. They should go home and not fight.’ ”"
2 Chronicles,18,17,"Ahab turned to Jehoshaphat and said, “I told you he would bring me bad news!”"
2 Chronicles,18,18,Micaiah replied: I then saw the LORD seated on his throne with every creature in heaven gathered around him.
2 Chronicles,18,19,"The LORD asked, “Who can trick Ahab and make him go to Ramoth where he will be killed?” They talked about it for a while,"
2 Chronicles,18,20,"then finally a spirit came forward and said to the LORD , “I can trick Ahab.” “How?” the LORD asked."
2 Chronicles,18,21,“I'll make Ahab's prophets lie to him.” “Good!” the LORD replied. “Now go and do it. You will be successful.”
2 Chronicles,18,22,"Ahab, this is exactly what has happened. The LORD made all your prophets lie to you, and he knows you will soon be destroyed."
2 Chronicles,18,23,"Zedekiah walked over and slapped Micaiah on the face. Then he asked, “Do you really think the LORD would speak to you and not to me?”"
2 Chronicles,18,24,"Micaiah answered, “You'll find out on the day you have to hide in the back room of some house.”"
2 Chronicles,18,25,"Ahab shouted, “Arrest Micaiah! Take him to Prince Joash and Governor Amon of Samaria."
2 Chronicles,18,26,Tell them to put him in prison and to give him nothing but bread and water until I come back safely.”
2 Chronicles,18,27,"Micaiah said, “If you do come back, I was wrong about what the LORD wanted me to say.” Then he told the crowd, “Don't forget what I said!”"
2 Chronicles,18,28,Ahab and Jehoshaphat led their armies to Ramoth in Gilead.
2 Chronicles,18,29,"Before they went into battle, Ahab said, “Jehoshaphat, I'll disguise myself, but you wear your royal robe.” Ahab disguised himself and went into battle."
2 Chronicles,18,30,The king of Syria had ordered his chariot commanders to attack only Ahab.
2 Chronicles,18,31,"So when they saw Jehoshaphat in his robe, they thought he was Ahab and started to attack him. But Jehoshaphat prayed, and the LORD made the Syrian soldiers stop."
2 Chronicles,18,32,"And when they realized he wasn't Ahab, they left him alone."
2 Chronicles,18,33,"However, during the fighting a soldier shot an arrow without even aiming, and it hit Ahab between two pieces of his armour. He shouted to his chariot driver, “I've been hit! Get me out of here!”"
2 Chronicles,18,34,"The fighting lasted all day, with Ahab propped up in his chariot so he could see the Syrian troops. He stayed there until evening, and by sundown he was dead."
2 Chronicles,19,1,Jehoshaphat returned safely to his palace in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,19,2,"But the prophet Jehu son of Hanani met him and said: By helping that wicked Ahab, you have made friends with someone who hates the LORD . Now the LORD God is angry with you!"
2 Chronicles,19,3,But not everything about you is bad. You destroyed the sacred poles used in worshipping the goddess Asherah—that shows you have tried to obey the LORD.
2 Chronicles,19,4,"Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem, but he often travelled through his kingdom, from Beersheba in the south to the edge of the hill country of Ephraim in the north. He talked with the people and convinced them to turn back to the LORD God and worship him, just as their ancestors had done."
2 Chronicles,19,5,He assigned judges to each of the fortified cities in Judah
2 Chronicles,19,6,"and told them: Be careful when you make your decisions in court, because these are the LORD 's people, and he will know what you decide."
2 Chronicles,19,7,So do your work in honour of him and know that he won't allow you to be unfair to anyone or to take bribes.
2 Chronicles,19,8,"Jehoshaphat also chose some Levites, some priests, and some of the family leaders, and he appointed them to serve as judges in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,19,9,He told them: Faithfully serve the LORD!
2 Chronicles,19,10,"The people of Judah will bring you legal cases that involve every type of crime, including murder. You must settle these cases and warn the people to stop sinning against the LORD , so that he won't get angry and punish Judah. Remember, if you follow these instructions, you won't be held responsible for anything that happens."
2 Chronicles,19,11,"Amariah the high priest will have the final say in any religious case. And Zebadiah, the leader of the Judah tribe, will have the final say in all other cases. The rest of the Levites will serve as your assistants. Be brave, and I pray that the LORD will help you do right."
2 Chronicles,20,1,"Some time later, the armies of Moab and Ammon, together with the Meunites, went to war against Jehoshaphat."
2 Chronicles,20,2,"Messengers told Jehoshaphat, “A large army from Edom east of the Dead Sea has invaded our country. They have already reached En-Gedi.”"
2 Chronicles,20,3,"Jehoshaphat was afraid, so he asked the LORD what to do. He then told the people of Judah to go without eating to show their sorrow."
2 Chronicles,20,4,They immediately left for Jerusalem to ask for the LORD 's help.
2 Chronicles,20,5,"After everyone from Judah and Jerusalem had come together at the LORD 's temple, Jehoshaphat stood in front of the new courtyard"
2 Chronicles,20,6,"and prayed: You, LORD , are the God our ancestors worshipped, and from heaven you rule every nation in the world. You are so powerful that no one can defeat you."
2 Chronicles,20,7,"Our God, you forced out the nations who lived in this land before your people Israel came here, and you gave it to the descendants of your friend Abraham for ever."
2 Chronicles,20,8,Our ancestors lived in this land and built a temple to honour you.
2 Chronicles,20,9,"They believed that whenever this land is struck by war or disease or famine, your people can pray to you at the temple, and you will hear their prayer and save them."
2 Chronicles,20,10,"You can see that the armies of Ammon, Moab, and Edom are attacking us! Those are the nations you would not let our ancestors invade on their way from Egypt, so these nations were not destroyed."
2 Chronicles,20,11,Now they are coming to take back the land you gave us.
2 Chronicles,20,12,Aren't you going to punish them? We won't stand a chance when this army attacks. We don't know what to do—we are begging for your help.
2 Chronicles,20,13,"While every man, woman, and child of Judah was standing there at the temple,"
2 Chronicles,20,14,"the LORD 's Spirit suddenly spoke to Jahaziel, a Levite from the Asaph clan."
2 Chronicles,20,15,"Then Jahaziel said: Your Majesty and everyone from Judah and Jerusalem, the LORD says that you don't need to be afraid or let this powerful army discourage you. God will fight on your side!"
2 Chronicles,20,16,So here's what you must do. Tomorrow the enemy armies will march through the desert around the town of Jeruel. March down and meet them at the town of Ziz as they come up the valley.
2 Chronicles,20,17,"You won't even have to fight. Just take your positions and watch the LORD rescue you from your enemy. Don't be afraid. Just do as you're told. And as you march out tomorrow, the LORD will be there with you."
2 Chronicles,20,18,Jehoshaphat bowed low to the ground and everyone worshipped the LORD.
2 Chronicles,20,19,Then some Levites from the Kohath and Korah clans stood up and shouted praises to the LORD God of Israel.
2 Chronicles,20,20,"Early the next morning, as everyone got ready to leave for the desert near Tekoa, Jehoshaphat stood up and said, “Listen my friends, if we trust the LORD God and believe what these prophets have told us, the LORD will help us, and we will be successful.”"
2 Chronicles,20,21,Then he explained his plan and appointed men to march in front of the army and praise the LORD for his holy power by singing: “Praise the LORD! His love never ends.”
2 Chronicles,20,22,"As soon as they began singing, the LORD confused the enemy camp,"
2 Chronicles,20,23,so that the Ammonite and Moabite troops attacked and completely destroyed those from Edom. Then they turned against each other and fought until the entire camp was wiped out!
2 Chronicles,20,24,"When Judah's army reached the tower that overlooked the desert, they saw that every soldier in the enemy's army was lying dead on the ground."
2 Chronicles,20,25,"So Jehoshaphat and his troops went into the camp to carry away everything of value. They found a large herd of livestock, a lot of equipment, clothes, and other valuable things. It took them three days to carry it all away, and there was still some left over."
2 Chronicles,20,26,"Then on the fourth day, everyone came together in Beracah Valley and sang praises to the LORD . That's why that place was called Praise Valley."
2 Chronicles,21,1,"Jehoshaphat died and was buried beside his ancestors in Jerusalem, and his son Jehoram became king."
2 Chronicles,21,2,"King Jehoshaphat had seven sons: Jehoram, Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, Michael, and Shephatiah."
2 Chronicles,21,3,"Jehoshaphat gave each of them silver and gold, as well as other valuable gifts. He also put them in charge of the fortified cities in Judah, but he had chosen his eldest son Jehoram to succeed him as king."
2 Chronicles,21,4,"After Jehoram had taken control of Judah, he had his brothers killed, as well as some of the nation's leaders."
2 Chronicles,21,5,"He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he ruled eight years from Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,21,6,"Jehoram married Ahab's daughter and followed the sinful example of Ahab's family and the other kings of Israel. He disobeyed the LORD by doing wrong,"
2 Chronicles,21,7,"but because the LORD had made a solemn promise to King David that someone from his family would always rule in Judah, he refused to wipe out David's descendants."
2 Chronicles,21,8,"While Jehoram was king, the people of Edom rebelled and chose their own king."
2 Chronicles,21,9,"Jehoram, his officers, and his cavalry marched to Edom, where the Edomite army surrounded them. He escaped during the night,"
2 Chronicles,21,10,"but Judah was never able to regain control of Edom. Even the town of Libnah rebelled at that time. Those things happened because Jehoram had turned away from the LORD , the God his ancestors had worshipped."
2 Chronicles,21,11,Jehoram even built local shrines in the hills of Judah and let the people sin against the LORD by worshipping foreign gods.
2 Chronicles,21,12,"One day, Jehoram received a letter from Elijah the prophet that said: I have a message for you from the LORD God your ancestor David worshipped. He knows that you have not followed the example of Jehoshaphat your father or Asa your grandfather."
2 Chronicles,21,13,"Instead you have acted like those sinful kings of Israel and have encouraged the people of Judah to stop worshipping the LORD , just as Ahab and his descendants did. You even murdered your own brothers, who were better men than you."
2 Chronicles,21,14,"Because you have done these terrible things, the LORD will severely punish the people in your kingdom, including your own family, and he will destroy everything you own."
2 Chronicles,21,15,You will be struck with a painful stomach disease and suffer until you die.
2 Chronicles,21,16,The LORD later caused the Philistines and the Arabs who lived near the Ethiopians to become angry with Jehoram.
2 Chronicles,21,17,"They invaded Judah and stole the royal property from the palace, and they led Jehoram's wives and sons away as prisoners. The only one left behind was Ahaziah, his youngest son."
2 Chronicles,21,18,"After this happened, the LORD struck Jehoram with an incurable stomach disease."
2 Chronicles,21,19,"About two years later, Jehoram died in terrible pain. No bonfire was built to honour him, even though the people had done this for his ancestors."
2 Chronicles,21,20,"Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he ruled eight years from Jerusalem. He died, and no one even felt sad. He was buried in Jerusalem, but not in the royal tombs."
2 Chronicles,22,1,"Earlier, when the Arabs led a raid against Judah, they killed all of Jehoram's sons, except Ahaziah, the youngest one. So the people of Jerusalem crowned him their king."
2 Chronicles,22,2,"He was twenty-two years old at the time, and he ruled only one year from Jerusalem. Ahaziah's mother was Athaliah, a granddaughter of King Omri of Israel,"
2 Chronicles,22,3,and she encouraged her son to sin against the LORD . He followed the evil example of King Ahab and his descendants.
2 Chronicles,22,4,"In fact, after his father's death, Ahaziah sinned against the LORD by appointing some of Ahab's relatives to be his advisers. Their advice led to his downfall."
2 Chronicles,22,5,"He listened to them and went with King Joram of Israel to attack King Hazael and the Syrian troops at Ramoth in Gilead. Joram was wounded in that battle,"
2 Chronicles,22,6,and he went to the town of Jezreel to recover. And Ahaziah later went there to visit him.
2 Chronicles,22,7,"It was during that visit that God had Ahaziah put to death. When Ahaziah arrived at Jezreel, he and Joram went to meet with Jehu, grandson of Nimshi. The LORD had already told Jehu to kill every male in Ahab's family,"
2 Chronicles,22,8,"and while Jehu was doing that, he saw some of Judah's leaders and Ahaziah's nephews who had come with Ahaziah. Jehu killed them on the spot,"
2 Chronicles,22,9,"then gave orders to find Ahaziah. Jehu's officers found him hiding in Samaria. They brought Ahaziah to Jehu, who immediately put him to death. They buried Ahaziah only because they respected Jehoshaphat his grandfather, who had done his best to obey the LORD. There was no one from Ahaziah's family left to become king of Judah."
2 Chronicles,22,10,"As soon as Athaliah heard that her son King Ahaziah was dead, she decided to kill any relative who could possibly become king. She would have done just that,"
2 Chronicles,22,11,"but Jehosheba rescued Joash son of Ahaziah just as the others were about to be murdered. Jehosheba, who was Jehoram's daughter and Ahaziah's half-sister, was married to Jehoiada the priest. So she was able to hide her nephew Joash and his personal servant in a bedroom in the LORD 's temple where he was safe from Athaliah."
2 Chronicles,22,12,Joash hid in the temple with them for six years while Athaliah ruled as queen of Judah.
2 Chronicles,23,1,"After Ahaziah's son Joash had hidden in the temple for six years, Jehoiada the priest knew that something had to be done. So he made sure he had the support of several army officers. They were Azariah son of Jeroham, Ishmael son of Jehohanan, Azariah son of Obed, Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat son of Zichri."
2 Chronicles,23,2,These five men went to the towns in Judah and called together the Levites and the clan leaders. They all came to Jerusalem
2 Chronicles,23,3,"and gathered at the temple, where they agreed to help Joash. Jehoiada said to them: Joash will be our next king, because long ago the LORD promised that one of David's descendants would always be king."
2 Chronicles,23,4,"Here is what we will do. Three groups of priests and Levites will be on guard duty on the Sabbath—one group will guard the gates of the temple,"
2 Chronicles,23,5,"one will guard the palace, and the other will guard Foundation Gate. The rest of you will stand guard in the temple courtyards."
2 Chronicles,23,6,"Only the priests and Levites who are on duty will be able to enter the temple, because they will be the only ones who have gone through the ceremony to make themselves clean and acceptable. The others must stay outside in the courtyards, just as the LORD has commanded."
2 Chronicles,23,7,You Levites must protect King Joash. Don't let him out of your sight! And keep your swords ready to kill anyone who comes into the temple.
2 Chronicles,23,8,"The Levites and the people of Judah followed Jehoiada's orders. The guards going off duty were not allowed to go home, and so each commander had all his guards available—those going off duty as well as those coming on duty."
2 Chronicles,23,9,"Jehoiada went into the temple and brought out the swords and shields that had belonged to King David, and he gave them to the commanders."
2 Chronicles,23,10,"They gave the weapons to the guards, and Jehoiada then made sure that the guards took their positions around the temple and the altar to protect the king on every side."
2 Chronicles,23,11,"Jehoiada and his sons brought Joash outside, where they placed the crown on his head and gave him a copy of the instructions for ruling the nation. Olive oil was poured on his head to show that he was now king, and the crowd cheered and shouted, “Long live the king!”"
2 Chronicles,23,12,"As soon as Queen Athaliah heard the crowd cheering for Joash, she went to the temple."
2 Chronicles,23,13,"There she saw Joash standing by one of the columns near the entrance, which was the usual place for the king. The commanders and the trumpet players were standing next to him, and the musicians were playing instruments and leading the people as they celebrated and blew trumpets. Athaliah tore her clothes in anger and shouted, “You betrayed me, you traitors!”"
2 Chronicles,23,14,"Straight away, Jehoiada said to the army commanders, “Don't kill her near the LORD 's temple. Take her out in front of the troops, and be sure to kill all her followers!”"
2 Chronicles,23,15,"She tried to escape, but the commanders caught and killed her near the gate where horses are led into the palace."
2 Chronicles,23,16,"Jehoiada asked King Joash and the people to join with him in being faithful to the LORD . They agreed,"
2 Chronicles,23,17,then rushed to the temple of the god Baal and tore it down. They smashed the altars and the idols and killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars.
2 Chronicles,23,18,"Jehoiada assigned the priests and Levites their duties at the temple, just as David had done. They were in charge of offering sacrifices to the LORD according to the Law of Moses, and they were responsible for leading the celebrations with singing."
2 Chronicles,23,19,Jehoiada ordered the guards at the temple gates to keep out anyone who was unclean.
2 Chronicles,23,20,"Finally, Jehoiada called together the army commanders, the most important citizens of Judah, and the government officials. The crowd of people followed them as they led Joash from the temple, through the Upper Gate, and into the palace, where he took his place as king of Judah."
2 Chronicles,23,21,Everyone celebrated because Athaliah had been killed and Jerusalem was peaceful again.
2 Chronicles,24,1,"Joash was only seven years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled forty years from Jerusalem. His mother Zibiah was from the town of Beersheba."
2 Chronicles,24,2,"While Jehoiada the priest was alive, Joash obeyed the LORD by doing right."
2 Chronicles,24,3,Jehoiada even chose two women for Joash to marry so he could have a family.
2 Chronicles,24,4,"Some time later, Joash decided it was time to repair the temple."
2 Chronicles,24,5,"He called together the priests and Levites and said, “Go everywhere in Judah and collect the annual tax from the people. I want this done straight away—we need that money to repair the temple.” But the Levites were in no hurry to follow the king's orders."
2 Chronicles,24,6,"So he sent for Jehoiada the high priest and asked, “Why didn't you send the Levites to collect the taxes? The LORD 's servant Moses and the people agreed long ago that this tax would be collected and used to pay for the upkeep of the sacred tent."
2 Chronicles,24,7,And now we need it to repair the temple because the sons of that evil woman Athaliah came in and wrecked it. They even used some of the sacred objects to worship the god Baal.”
2 Chronicles,24,8,"Joash gave orders for a wooden box to be made and had it placed outside, near the gate of the temple."
2 Chronicles,24,9,"He then sent letters everywhere in Judah and Jerusalem, asking everyone to bring their taxes to the temple, just as Moses had required their ancestors to do."
2 Chronicles,24,10,"The people and their leaders agreed, and they brought their money to Jerusalem and placed it in the box."
2 Chronicles,24,11,"Each day, after the Levites took the box into the temple, the king's secretary and the high priest's assistant would take out the money and count it. Then the empty box would be taken back outside. This happened day after day, and soon a large amount of money was collected."
2 Chronicles,24,12,"Joash and Jehoiada turned the money over to the men who were supervising the repairs to the temple. They used the money to hire stonecutters, carpenters, and experts in working with iron and bronze."
2 Chronicles,24,13,"These workers went straight to work repairing the temple, and when they had finished, it looked as good as new."
2 Chronicles,24,14,"They did not use all the tax money for the repairs, so the rest of it was handed over to Joash and Jehoiada, who then used it to make dishes and other gold and silver objects for the temple. Sacrifices to please the LORD were offered regularly in the temple for as long as Jehoiada lived."
2 Chronicles,24,15,"He died at the ripe old age of one hundred and thirty years,"
2 Chronicles,24,16,"and he was buried in the royal tombs in Jerusalem, because he had done so much good for the people of Israel, for God, and for the temple."
2 Chronicles,24,17,"After the death of Jehoiada the priest, the leaders of Judah went to Joash and talked him into doing what they wanted."
2 Chronicles,24,18,"Straight away, the people of Judah stopped worshipping in the temple of the LORD God, and they started worshipping idols and the symbols of the goddess Asherah. These sinful things made the LORD God angry with the people of Judah and Jerusalem,"
2 Chronicles,24,19,but he still sent prophets who warned them to turn back to him. The people refused to listen.
2 Chronicles,24,20,"God's Spirit spoke to Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest, and Zechariah told everyone that God was saying: “Why are you disobeying me and my laws? This will only bring punishment! You have deserted me, so now I will desert you.”"
2 Chronicles,25,1,"Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he ruled twenty-nine years from Jerusalem, the home town of his mother Jehoaddin."
2 Chronicles,25,2,"Even though Amaziah obeyed the LORD by doing right, he refused to be completely faithful."
2 Chronicles,25,3,"For example, as soon as he had control of Judah, he arrested and killed the officers who had murdered his father."
2 Chronicles,25,4,But the children of those officers were not killed; the LORD had commanded in the Law of Moses that only the people who sinned were to be punished.
2 Chronicles,25,5,"Amaziah sent a message to the tribes of Judah and Benjamin and called together all the men who were twenty years old and older. Three hundred thousand men went to Jerusalem, all of them ready for battle and able to fight with spears and shields. Amaziah grouped these soldiers according to their clans and put them under the command of his army officers."
2 Chronicles,25,6,Amaziah also paid about three thousand four hundred kilogrammes of silver to hire one hundred thousand soldiers from Israel.
2 Chronicles,25,7,"One of God's prophets said, “Your Majesty, don't let these Israelite soldiers march into battle with you. The LORD has refused to help anyone from the northern kingdom of Israel,"
2 Chronicles,25,8,"and so he will let your enemies defeat you, even if you fight hard. He is the one who brings both victory and defeat.”"
2 Chronicles,25,9,"Amaziah replied, “What am I supposed to do about all the silver I paid those troops?” “The LORD will give you back even more than you paid,” the prophet answered."
2 Chronicles,25,10,"Amaziah ordered the troops from Israel to go home, but when they left, they were furious with the people of Judah."
2 Chronicles,25,11,"After Amaziah got his courage back, he led his troops to Salt Valley, where he killed ten thousand Edomite soldiers in battle."
2 Chronicles,25,12,"He captured ten thousand more soldiers and dragged them to the top of a high cliff. Then he pushed them over the side, and they were all killed on the rocks below."
2 Chronicles,25,13,"Meanwhile, the Israelite troops that Amaziah had sent home, raided the towns in Judah between Samaria and Beth-Horon. They killed three thousand people and carried off their possessions."
2 Chronicles,25,14,"After Amaziah had defeated the Edomite army, he returned to Jerusalem. He took with him the idols of the Edomite gods and set them up. Then he bowed down and offered them sacrifices."
2 Chronicles,25,15,"This made the LORD very angry, and he sent a prophet to ask Amaziah, “Why would you worship these foreign gods that couldn't even save their own people from your attack?”"
2 Chronicles,25,16,"But before the prophet finished speaking, Amaziah interrupted and said, “You're not one of my advisers! Don't say another word, or I'll have you killed.” The prophet stopped. But then he added, “First you sinned and now you've ignored my warning. It's clear that God has decided to punish you!”"
2 Chronicles,25,17,"King Amaziah of Judah talked with his officials, then sent a message to King Jehoash of Israel: “Come out and face me in battle!”"
2 Chronicles,25,18,"Jehoash sent back a reply that said: Once upon a time, a small thorn bush in Lebanon arranged the marriage between his son and the daughter of a large cedar tree. But a wild animal came along and trampled the small bush."
2 Chronicles,25,19,"Amaziah, you think you're so powerful because you defeated Edom. But stay at home and do your celebrating. If you cause any trouble, both you and your kingdom of Judah will be destroyed."
2 Chronicles,25,20,"God made Amaziah stubborn because he was planning to punish him for worshipping the Edomite gods. Amaziah refused to listen to Jehoash's warning,"
2 Chronicles,25,21,so Jehoash led his army to the town of Beth-Shemesh in Judah to attack Amaziah and his troops.
2 Chronicles,25,22,"During the battle, Judah's army was crushed. Every soldier from Judah ran back home,"
2 Chronicles,25,23,"and Jehoash captured Amaziah. Jehoash took Amaziah with him when he went to attack Jerusalem. Jehoash broke down the city wall from Ephraim Gate to Corner Gate, a section nearly two hundred metres long."
2 Chronicles,25,24,"He carried away the gold, the silver, and all the valuable furnishings from God's temple where the descendants of Obed-Edom stood guard. He robbed the king's treasury, took hostages, then returned to Samaria."
2 Chronicles,25,25,Amaziah lived fifteen years after Jehoash died.
2 Chronicles,25,26,Everything else Amaziah did while he was king is written in The History of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
2 Chronicles,25,27,"As soon as Amaziah started disobeying the LORD , some people in Jerusalem plotted against Amaziah. He was able to escape to the town of Lachish, but another group of people caught him and killed him there."
2 Chronicles,25,28,His body was taken to Jerusalem on horseback and buried beside his ancestors.
2 Chronicles,27,1,"Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled from Jerusalem for sixteen years. Jerushah his mother was the daughter of Zadok."
2 Chronicles,27,2,"Jotham obeyed the LORD and did right. He followed the example of his father Uzziah, except he never burnt incense in the temple as his father had done. But the people of Judah kept sinning against the LORD."
2 Chronicles,27,3,Jotham rebuilt the Upper Gate of the temple and did a lot of work to repair the wall near Mount Ophel.
2 Chronicles,27,4,He built towns in the mountains of Judah and built fortresses and defence towers in the forests.
2 Chronicles,27,5,"During his rule he attacked and defeated the Ammonites. Then every year for the next three years, he forced them to pay three thousand four hundred kilogrammes of silver, one thousand tonnes of wheat, and one thousand tonnes of barley."
2 Chronicles,27,6,Jotham remained faithful to the LORD his God and became a very powerful king.
2 Chronicles,27,7,"Everything else Jotham did while he was king, including the wars he fought, is written in The History of the Kings of Israel and Judah."
2 Chronicles,27,8,"After he had ruled Judah sixteen years, he died at the age of forty-one."
2 Chronicles,27,9,"He was buried in Jerusalem, and his son Ahaz became king."
2 Chronicles,28,1,"Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled from Jerusalem for sixteen years. Ahaz was nothing like his ancestor David. Ahaz disobeyed the LORD"
2 Chronicles,28,2,"and was as sinful as the kings of Israel. He made idols of the god Baal,"
2 Chronicles,28,3,"and he offered sacrifices in Hinnom Valley. Worst of all, Ahaz sacrificed his own sons, which was a disgusting custom of the nations that the LORD had forced out of Israel."
2 Chronicles,28,4,"Ahaz offered sacrifices at the local shrines, as well as on every hill and in the shade of large trees."
2 Chronicles,29,1,"Hezekiah was twenty-five years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled twenty-nine years from Jerusalem. His mother was Abijah daughter of Zechariah."
2 Chronicles,29,2,"Hezekiah obeyed the LORD by doing right, just as his ancestor David had done."
2 Chronicles,29,3,"In the first month of the first year of Hezekiah's rule, he unlocked the doors to the LORD 's temple and had them repaired."
2 Chronicles,29,4,Then he called the priests and Levites to the east courtyard of the temple
2 Chronicles,29,5,"and said: It's time to purify the temple of the LORD God of our ancestors. You Levites must first go through the ceremony to make yourselves clean, then go into the temple and bring out everything that is unclean and unacceptable to the LORD."
2 Chronicles,29,6,"Some of our ancestors were unfaithful and disobeyed the LORD our God. Not only did they turn their backs on the LORD , but they also completely ignored his temple."

2 Chronicles,29,8,"The LORD became terribly angry with the people of Judah and Jerusalem, and everyone was shocked and horrified at what he did to punish them. Not only were"
2 Chronicles,29,9,"our ancestors killed in battle, but our own children and wives were taken captive."
2 Chronicles,29,10,So I have decided to renew our agreement with the LORD God of Israel. Perhaps then he will stop being so angry with us.
2 Chronicles,29,11,"Let's not waste any time, my friends. You are the ones who were chosen to be the LORD 's priests and to offer him sacrifices."
2 Chronicles,31,1,"After the Festival, the people went to every town in Judah and smashed the stone images of foreign gods and cut down the sacred poles for worshipping the goddess Asherah. They destroyed all the local shrines and foreign altars in Judah, as well as those in the territories of Benjamin, Ephraim, and West Manasseh. Then everyone went home."
2 Chronicles,31,2,"Hezekiah divided the priests and Levites into groups, according to their duties. Then he assigned them the responsibilities of offering sacrifices to please the LORD and sacrifices to ask his blessing. He also appointed people to serve at the temple and to sing praises at the temple gates."
2 Chronicles,31,3,"Hezekiah provided animals from his own herds and flocks to use for the morning and evening sacrifices, as well as for the sacrifices during the Sabbath celebrations, the New Moon Festivals, and the other religious feasts required by the Law of the LORD."

2 Chronicles,31,8,"When Hezekiah and his officials saw these offerings, they thanked the LORD and the people."

2 Chronicles,31,10,"The high priest at the time was Azariah, a descendant of Zadok, and he replied, “Ever since the people have been bringing us their offerings, we have had more than enough food and supplies. The LORD has certainly blessed his people. Look at how much is left over!”"

2 Chronicles,32,1,"After King Hezekiah had faithfully obeyed the LORD 's instructions by doing these things, King Sennacherib of Assyria invaded Judah. He attacked the fortified cities and thought he would capture every one of them."

2 Chronicles,33,2,Manasseh disobeyed the LORD by following the disgusting customs of the nations that the LORD had forced out of Israel.
2 Chronicles,33,3,He rebuilt the local shrines that his father Hezekiah had torn down. He built altars for the god Baal and set up sacred poles for worshipping the goddess Asherah. And he faithfully worshipped the stars in the sky.
2 Chronicles,33,4,"In the temple, where only the LORD was supposed to be worshipped, Manasseh built altars for pagan gods"
2 Chronicles,33,5,and for the stars. He placed these altars in both courtyards of the temple
2 Chronicles,34,1,"Josiah was eight years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled thirty-one years from Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,34,2,He followed the example of his ancestor David and always obeyed the LORD.

2 Chronicles,34,4,"He watched as the altars for the worship of the god Baal were torn down, and as the nearby incense altars were smashed. The Asherah poles, the idols, and the stone images were also smashed, and the pieces were scattered over the graves of their worshippers."
2 Chronicles,34,5,Josiah then had the bones of the pagan priests burnt on the altars. And so Josiah got rid of the worship of foreign gods in Judah and Jerusalem.

2 Chronicles,34,9,"These three men went to Hilkiah the high priest. They gave him the money that the Levite guards had collected from the people of West Manasseh, Ephraim, and the rest of Israel, as well as those living in Judah, Benjamin, and Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,34,10,"Then the money was turned over to the men who supervised the repairs to the temple. They used some of it to pay the workers,"
2 Chronicles,34,11,"and they gave the rest of it to the carpenters and builders, who used it to buy the stone and wood they needed to repair the other buildings that Judah's kings had not taken care of."
2 Chronicles,34,12,"The workers were honest, and their supervisors were Jahath and Obadiah from the Levite clan of Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam from the Levite clan of Kohath. Other Levites, who were all skilled musicians,"

2 Chronicles,34,15,"Hilkiah handed the book to Shaphan the official and said, “Look what I found here in the temple— The Book of God's Law .”"
2 Chronicles,34,16,"Shaphan took the book to Josiah and reported, “Your officials are doing everything you wanted."

2 Chronicles,34,23,"she said: You were sent here by King Josiah, and this is what the LORD God of Israel says to him:"
2 Chronicles,34,24,"“Josiah, I am the LORD ! And I intend to punish this country and everyone in it, just as this book says."
2 Chronicles,34,25,The people of Judah and Israel have rejected me. They have offered sacrifices to foreign gods and have worshipped their own idols. I can't stand it any longer. I am furious.

2 Chronicles,35,3,"He called together the Levites who served the LORD and who taught the people his laws, and he said: No longer will you have to carry the sacred chest from place to place.

2 Chronicles,35,14,"All day long, the priests were busy offering sacrifices and burning the animals' fat on the altar. And when everyone had finished, the Levites prepared Passover animals for themselves and for the priests."
2 Chronicles,35,15,"During the celebration some of the Levites prepared Passover animals for the musicians and the guards, so that the Levite musicians would not have to leave their places, which had been assigned to them according to the instructions of David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the king's prophet. Even the guards at the temple gates did not have to leave their posts."
