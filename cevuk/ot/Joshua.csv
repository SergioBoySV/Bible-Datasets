Joshua,1,1,"Moses, the LORD 's servant, was dead. So the LORD spoke to Joshua son of Nun, who had been the assistant of Moses. The LORD said:"
Joshua,1,2,My servant Moses is dead. Now you must lead Israel across the River Jordan into the land I'm giving to all of you.
Joshua,1,3,"Wherever you go, I'll give you that land, as I promised Moses."
Joshua,1,4,"It will reach from the Southern Desert to the Lebanon Mountains in the north, and to the north-east as far as the great River Euphrates. It will include the land of the Hittites, and the land from here at the River Jordan to the Mediterranean Sea on the west."
Joshua,1,5,"Joshua, I will always be with you and help you as I helped Moses, and no one will ever be able to defeat you."
Joshua,2,1,"Joshua chose two men as spies and sent them from their camp at Acacia with these instructions: “Go across the river and find out as much as you can about the whole region, especially about the town of Jericho.” The two spies left the Israelite camp at Acacia and went to Jericho, where they decided to spend the night at the house of a prostitute named Rahab."
Joshua,2,2,"But someone found out about them and told the king of Jericho, “Some Israelite men came here tonight, and they are spies.”"
Joshua,3,1,"Early the next morning, Joshua and the Israelites packed up and left Acacia. They went to the River Jordan and camped there that night."
Joshua,3,2,"Two days later their leaders went through the camp,"
Joshua,4,1,"After Israel had crossed the Jordan, the LORD said to Joshua:"
Joshua,5,1,"The Amorite kings west of the River Jordan and the Canaanite kings along the Mediterranean Sea lost their courage and their will to fight, when they heard how the LORD had dried up the River Jordan to let Israel go across."
Joshua,5,2,"While Israel was camped at Gilgal, the LORD said, “Joshua, make some flint knives and circumcise the rest of the Israelite men and boys.”"
Joshua,5,3,"Joshua made the knives, then circumcised those men and boys at Haaraloth Hill."
Joshua,6,1,"Meanwhile, the people of Jericho had been locking the gates in their town wall because they were afraid of the Israelites. No one could go out or come in."
Joshua,7,1,"The LORD had said that everything in Jericho belonged to him. But Achan from the Judah tribe took some of the things from Jericho for himself. And so the LORD was angry with the Israelites, because one of them had disobeyed him."
Joshua,7,2,"While Israel was still camped near Jericho, Joshua sent some spies with these instructions: “Go to the town of Ai and find out whatever you can about the region around the town.” The spies left and went to Ai, which is east of Bethel and near Beth-Aven."
Joshua,7,3,"They went back to Joshua and reported, “You don't need to send the whole army to attack Ai—two or three thousand troops will be enough. Why bother the whole army for a town that small?”"
Joshua,10,1,"King Adonizedek of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had captured and destroyed the town of Ai, and then killed its king as he had done at Jericho. He also learnt that the Gibeonites had signed a peace treaty with Israel."
Joshua,10,2,"This frightened Adonizedek and his people. They knew that Gibeon was a large town, as big as the towns that had kings, and even bigger than the town of Ai had been. And all the men of Gibeon were warriors."
Joshua,10,3,"So Adonizedek sent messages to the kings of four other towns: King Hoham of Hebron, King Piram of Jarmuth, King Japhia of Lachish, and King Debir of Eglon. The messages said,"
Joshua,10,4,“The Gibeonites have signed a peace treaty with Joshua and the Israelites. Come and help me attack Gibeon!”
Joshua,10,5,"When these five Amorite kings called their armies together and attacked Gibeon,"
Joshua,10,6,"the Gibeonites sent a message to the Israelite camp at Gilgal: “Joshua, please come and rescue us! The Amorite kings from the hill country have joined together and are attacking us. We are your servants, so don't let us down. Please hurry!”"
Joshua,10,7,"Joshua and his army, including his best warriors, left Gilgal."
Joshua,10,8,"“Joshua,” the LORD said, “don't be afraid of the Amorites. They will run away when you attack, and I will help you defeat them.”"
Joshua,10,9,Joshua marched all night from Gilgal to Gibeon and made a surprise attack on the Amorite camp.
Joshua,10,10,"The LORD made the enemy panic, and the Israelites started killing them right and left. They chased the Amorite troops up the road to Beth-Horon and kept on killing them, until they reached the towns of Azekah and Makkedah."
Joshua,10,11,"And while these troops were going down through Beth-Horon Pass, the LORD made huge hailstones fall on them all the way to Azekah. More of the enemy soldiers died from the hail than from the Israelite weapons."
Joshua,11,1,"King Jabin of Hazor heard about Joshua's victories, so he sent messages to many nearby kings and asked them to join him in fighting Israel. He sent these messages to King Jobab of Madon, the kings of Shimron and Achshaph,"
Joshua,11,2,"the kings in the northern hill country and in the valley of the River Jordan south of Lake Galilee, and the kings in the foothills and in Naphath-Dor to the west."
Joshua,11,3,"He sent messages to the Canaanite kings in the east and the west, to the Amorite, Hittite, Perizzite, and Jebusite kings in the hill country, and to the Hivite kings in the region of Mizpah, near the foot of Mount Hermon."
Joshua,12,1,"Before Moses died, he and the people of Israel had defeated two kings east of the River Jordan. These kings had ruled the region from the gorge of the River Arnon in the south to Mount Hermon in the north, including the eastern side of the Jordan valley."
Joshua,12,2,"The first king whom Moses and the Israelites defeated was an Amorite, King Sihon of Heshbon. The southern border of his kingdom ran down the middle of the Arnon gorge, taking in the town of Aroer on the northern edge of the gorge. The River Jabbok separated Sihon's kingdom from the Ammonites on the east. Then the Jabbok turned west and became his northern border, so his kingdom included the southern half of the region of Gilead."
Joshua,12,3,"Sihon also controlled the eastern side of the Jordan valley from Lake Galilee south to Beth-Jeshimoth and the Dead Sea. In addition to these regions, he ruled the town called Slopes of Mount Pisgah and the land south of there at the foot of the hill."
Joshua,12,4,"Next, Moses and the Israelites defeated King Og of Bashan, who lived in the town of Ashtaroth part of each year and in Edrei the rest of the year. Og was one of the last of the Rephaim."
Joshua,12,5,"His kingdom stretched north to Mount Hermon, east to the town of Salecah, and included the land of Bashan as far west as the borders of the kingdoms of Geshur and Maacah. He also ruled the northern half of Gilead."
Joshua,12,6,"Moses, the LORD 's servant, had led the people of Israel in defeating Sihon and Og. Then Moses gave their land to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh."
Joshua,13,1,"Many years later, the LORD told Joshua: Now you are very old, but there is still a lot of land that Israel has not yet taken."
Joshua,15,1,"The clans of the Judah tribe were given land that went south along the border of Edom, and at its furthest point south it even reached the Zin Desert."
Joshua,15,2,Judah's southern border started at the south end of the Dead Sea.
Joshua,15,3,"As it went west from there, it ran south of Scorpion Pass to Zin, and then came up from the south to Kadesh-Barnea. It continued past Hezron up to Addar, turned towards Karka,"
Joshua,15,4,"and ran along to Azmon. After that, it followed the Egyptian Gorge and ended at the Mediterranean Sea. This was also Israel's southern border."
Joshua,15,5,Judah's eastern border ran the full length of the Dead Sea. The northern border started at the northern end of the Dead Sea.
Joshua,15,6,"From there it went west up to Beth-Hoglah, continued north of Beth-Arabah, and went up to the Monument of Bohan, who belonged to the Reuben tribe."
Joshua,15,7,"From there, it went to Trouble Valley and Debir, then turned north and went to Gilgal, which is on the north side of the valley across from Adummim Pass. It continued on to Enshemesh, Enrogel,"
Joshua,15,8,"and up through Hinnom Valley on the land sloping south from Jerusalem. The city of Jerusalem itself belonged to the Jebusites. Next, the border went up to the top of the mountain on the west side of Hinnom Valley and at the north end of Rephaim Valley."
Joshua,15,9,"At the top of the mountain it turned and went to Nephtoah Spring and then to the ruins on Mount Ephron. From there, it went to Baalah, which is now called Kiriath-Jearim."
Joshua,15,10,"From Baalah the northern border curved west to Mount Seir and then ran along the northern ridge of Mount Jearim, where Chesalon is. Then it went down to Beth-Shemesh and over to Timnah."
Joshua,15,11,"It continued along to the hillside north of Ekron, curved around to Shikkeron, and then went to Mount Baalah. After going to Jabneel, the border finally ended at the Mediterranean Sea,"
Joshua,15,12,which was Judah's western border. The clans of Judah lived within these borders.
Joshua,15,13,"Joshua gave Caleb some land among the people of Judah, as God had told him to do. Caleb's share was Hebron, which at that time was known as Arba's Town, because Arba was the famous ancestor of the Anakim."
Joshua,15,14,"Caleb attacked Hebron and forced the three Anakim clans of Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai to leave."
Joshua,15,15,"Next, Caleb started a war with the town of Debir, which at that time was called Kiriath-Sepher."
Joshua,15,16,"He told his men, “The man who captures Kiriath-Sepher can marry my daughter Achsah.”"
Joshua,15,17,"Caleb's nephew Othniel captured Kiriath-Sepher, and Caleb let him marry Achsah."
Joshua,15,18,"Straight after the wedding, Achsah started telling Othniel that he ought to ask her father for a field. She went to see her father, and while she was getting down from her donkey, Caleb asked her, “What's bothering you?”"
Joshua,15,19,"She answered, “I need your help. The land you gave me is in the Southern Desert, so I really need some spring-fed ponds for a water supply.” Caleb gave her a couple of small ponds, named Higher Pond and Lower Pond."
Joshua,15,20,The following is a list of the towns in each region given to the Judah clans:
Joshua,18,1,"After Israel had captured the land, they met at Shiloh and set up the sacred tent."
Joshua,18,2,"There were still seven tribes without any land,"
Joshua,19,1,"Simeon was the second tribe chosen to receive land, and the region for its clans was inside Judah's borders."
Joshua,20,1,One day the LORD told Joshua:
Joshua,20,2,"When Moses was still alive, I told him to tell the Israelites about the Safe Towns. Now you tell them that it is time to set up these towns."
Joshua,22,1,"Joshua called the men of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh to a meeting, and he told them:"
Joshua,23,1,"The LORD let Israel live in peace with its neighbours for a long time, and Joshua lived to a ripe old age."
Joshua,23,2,"One day he called a meeting of the leaders of the tribes of Israel, including the old men, the judges, and the officials. Then he told them: I am now very old."
Joshua,23,3,You have seen how the LORD your God fought for you and helped you defeat the nations who lived in this land.
Joshua,24,1,"Joshua called the tribes of Israel together for a meeting at Shechem. He made the leaders, including the old men, the judges, and the officials, come up and stand near the sacred tent."
Joshua,24,2,"Then Joshua told everyone to listen to this message from the LORD , the God of Israel: Long ago your ancestors lived on the other side of the River Euphrates, and they worshipped other gods. This continued until the time of your ancestor Terah and his two sons, Abraham and Nahor."
Joshua,24,3,"But I brought Abraham across the River Euphrates and led him through the land of Canaan. I blessed him by giving him Isaac, the first in a line of many descendants."
Joshua,24,4,"Then I gave Isaac two sons, Jacob and Esau. I let Esau live in the hill country of Mount Seir, but your ancestor Jacob and his children went to live in Egypt."
