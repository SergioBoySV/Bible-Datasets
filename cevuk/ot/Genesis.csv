Genesis,1,1,In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
Genesis,1,2,"The earth was barren, with no form of life; it was under a roaring ocean covered with darkness. But the Spirit of God was moving over the water."
Genesis,1,3,"God said, “I command light to shine!” And light started shining."
Genesis,1,4,God looked at the light and saw that it was good. He separated light from darkness
Genesis,1,5,and named the light “Day” and the darkness “Night”. Evening came and then morning—that was the first day.
Genesis,1,6,"God said, “I command a dome to separate the water above it from the water below it.”"
Genesis,1,7,And that's what happened. God made the dome
Genesis,1,8,and named it “Sky”. Evening came and then morning—that was the second day.
Genesis,1,9,"God said, “I command the water under the sky to come together in one place, so there will be dry ground.” And that's what happened."
Genesis,1,10,"God named the dry ground “Land”, and he named the water “Sea”. God looked at what he had done and saw that it was good."
Genesis,1,11,"God said, “I command the earth to produce all kinds of plants, including fruit trees and grain.” And that's what happened."
Genesis,1,12,"The earth produced all kinds of vegetation. God looked at what he had done, and it was good."
Genesis,1,13,Evening came and then morning—that was the third day.
Genesis,1,14,"God said, “I command lights to appear in the sky and to separate day from night and to show the time for seasons, special days, and years."
Genesis,1,15,I command them to shine on the earth.” And that's what happened.
Genesis,1,16,"God made two powerful lights, the brighter one to rule the day and the other to rule the night. He also made the stars."
Genesis,1,17,"Then God put these lights in the sky to shine on the earth,"
Genesis,1,18,"to rule day and night, and to separate light from darkness. God looked at what he had done, and it was good."
Genesis,1,19,Evening came and then morning—that was the fourth day.
Genesis,1,20,"God said, “I command the sea to be full of living creatures, and I command birds to fly above the earth.”"
Genesis,1,21,"So God made the giant sea monsters and all the living creatures that swim in the sea. He also made every kind of bird. God looked at what he had done, and it was good."
Genesis,1,22,Then he gave the living creatures his blessing—he told the sea creatures to live everywhere in the sea and the birds to live everywhere on earth.
Genesis,1,23,Evening came and then morning—that was the fifth day.
Genesis,1,24,"God said, “I command the earth to give life to all kinds of tame animals, wild animals, and reptiles.” And that's what happened."
Genesis,1,25,"God made every one of them. Then he looked at what he had done, and it was good."
Genesis,1,26,"God said, “Now we will make humans, and they will be like us. We will let them rule the fish, the birds, and all other living creatures.”"
Genesis,1,27,So God created humans to be like himself; he made men and women.
Genesis,1,28,"God gave them his blessing and said: Have a lot of children! Fill the earth with people and bring it under your control. Rule over the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, and every animal on the earth."
Genesis,1,29,I have provided all kinds of fruit and grain for you to eat.
Genesis,1,30,"And I have given the green plants as food for everything else that breathes. These will be food for animals, both wild and tame, and for birds."
Genesis,1,31,God looked at what he had done. All of it was very good! Evening came and then morning—that was the sixth day.
Genesis,2,1,So the heavens and the earth and everything else were created.
Genesis,2,2,"By the seventh day God had finished his work, and so he rested."
Genesis,2,3,God blessed the seventh day and made it special because on that day he rested from his work.
Genesis,2,4,"That's how God created the heavens and the earth. When the LORD God made the heavens and the earth,"
Genesis,2,5,"no grass or plants were growing anywhere. God had not yet sent any rain, and there was no one to work the land."
Genesis,2,6,But streams came up from the ground and watered the earth.
Genesis,2,7,"The LORD God took a handful of soil and made a man. God breathed life into the man, and the man started breathing."
Genesis,2,8,"The LORD made a garden in a place called Eden, which was in the east, and he put the man there."
Genesis,2,9,The LORD God placed all kinds of beautiful trees and fruit trees in the garden. Two other trees were in the middle of the garden. One of the trees gave life—the other gave the power to know the difference between right and wrong.
Genesis,2,10,"From Eden a river flowed out to water the garden, then it divided into four rivers."
Genesis,2,11,"The first one is the River Pishon that flows through the land of Havilah,"
Genesis,2,12,"where pure gold, rare perfumes, and precious stones are found."
Genesis,2,13,The second is the River Gihon that winds through Ethiopia.
Genesis,2,14,"The River Tigris that flows east of Assyria is the third, and the fourth is the River Euphrates."
Genesis,2,15,The LORD God put the man in the Garden of Eden to take care of it and to look after it.
Genesis,2,16,"But the LORD told him, “You may eat fruit from any tree in the garden,"
Genesis,2,17,"except the one that has the power to let you know the difference between right and wrong. If you eat any fruit from that tree, you will die before the day is over!”"
Genesis,2,18,"The LORD God said, “It isn't good for the man to live alone. I need to make a suitable partner for him.”"
Genesis,3,1,"The snake was more cunning than any of the other wild animals that the LORD God had made. One day it came to the woman and asked, “Did God tell you not to eat fruit from any tree in the garden?”"
Genesis,3,2,"The woman answered, “God said we could eat fruit from any tree in the garden,"
Genesis,3,3,"except the one in the middle. He told us not to eat fruit from that tree or even to touch it. If we do, we will die.”"
Genesis,3,4,"“No, you won't!” the snake replied."
Genesis,3,5,"“God understands what will happen on the day you eat fruit from that tree. You will see what you have done, and you will know the difference between right and wrong, just as God does.”"
Genesis,3,6,"The woman stared at the fruit. It looked beautiful and tasty. She wanted the wisdom that it would give her, and she ate some of the fruit. Her husband was there with her, so she gave some to him, and he ate it too."
Genesis,3,7,"Straight away they saw what they had done, and they realized they were naked. Then they sewed fig leaves together to make something to cover themselves."
Genesis,3,8,"Late in the afternoon a breeze began to blow, and the man and woman heard the LORD God walking in the garden. They were frightened and hid behind some trees."
Genesis,3,9,"The LORD called out to the man and asked, “Where are you?”"
Genesis,3,10,"The man answered, “I was naked, and when I heard you walking through the garden, I was frightened and hid!”"
Genesis,3,11,“How did you know you were naked?” God asked. “Did you eat any fruit from that tree in the middle of the garden?”
Genesis,3,12,"“It was the woman you put here with me,” the man said. “She gave me some of the fruit, and I ate it.”"
Genesis,3,13,"The LORD God then asked the woman, “What have you done?” “The snake tricked me,” she answered. “And I ate some of that fruit.”"
Genesis,3,14,"So the LORD God said to the snake: “Because of what you have done, you will be the only animal to suffer this curse— for as long as you live, you will crawl on your stomach and eat dust."
Genesis,3,15,"You and this woman will hate each other; your descendants and hers will always be enemies. One of hers will strike you on the head, and you will strike him on the heel.”"
Genesis,3,16,"Then the LORD said to the woman, “You will suffer terribly when you give birth. But you will still desire your husband, and he will rule over you.”"
Genesis,3,17,"The LORD said to the man, “You listened to your wife and ate fruit from that tree. And so, the ground will be under a curse because of what you did. As long as you live, you will have to struggle to grow enough food."
Genesis,3,18,"Your food will be plants, but the ground will produce thorns and thistles."
Genesis,3,19,"You will have to sweat to earn a living; you were made out of soil, and you will once again turn into soil.”"
Genesis,3,20,The man Adam named his wife Eve because she would become the mother of all who live.
Genesis,3,21,Then the LORD God made clothes out of animal skins for the man and his wife.
Genesis,3,22,"The LORD said, “These people now know the difference between right and wrong, just as we do. But they must not be allowed to eat fruit from the tree that lets them live for ever.”"
Genesis,3,23,"So the LORD God sent them out of the Garden of Eden, where they would have to work the ground from which the man had been made."
Genesis,3,24,"Then God put winged creatures at the entrance to the garden and a flaming, flashing sword to guard the way to the life-giving tree."
Genesis,4,1,"Adam and Eve had a son. Then Eve said, “I'll name him Cain because I got him with the help of the LORD .”"
Genesis,4,2,"Later she had another son and named him Abel. Abel became a sheep farmer, but Cain farmed the land."
Genesis,4,3,"One day, Cain gave part of his harvest to the LORD,"
Genesis,4,4,"and Abel also gave an offering to the LORD . He killed the firstborn lamb from one of his sheep and gave the LORD the best parts of it. The LORD was pleased with Abel and his offering,"
Genesis,4,5,but not with Cain and his offering. This made Cain so angry that he could not hide his feelings.
Genesis,4,6,The LORD said to Cain: What's wrong with you? Why do you have such an angry look on your face?
Genesis,4,7,"If you had done the right thing, you would be smiling. But you did the wrong thing, and now sin is waiting to attack you like a lion. Sin wants to destroy you, but don't let it!"
Genesis,4,8,"Cain said to his brother Abel, “Let's go for a walk.” And when they were out in a field, Cain killed him."
Genesis,4,9,"Afterwards the LORD asked Cain, “Where is Abel?” “How should I know?” he answered. “Am I supposed to look after my brother?”"
Genesis,4,10,"Then the LORD said: Why have you done this terrible thing? You killed your own brother, and his blood flowed on to the ground. Now his blood is calling out for me to punish you."
Genesis,4,11,"And so, I'll put you under a curse. Because you killed Abel and made his blood run out on the ground, you will never be able to farm the land again."
Genesis,4,12,"If you try to farm the land, it won't produce anything for you. From now on, you'll be without a home, and you'll spend the rest of your life wandering from place to place."
Genesis,4,13,“This punishment is too hard!” Cain said.
Genesis,4,14,"“You're making me leave my home and live far from you. I will have to wander about without a home, and anyone could kill me.”"
Genesis,4,15,“No!” the LORD answered. “Anyone who kills you will be punished seven times worse than I am punishing you.” So the LORD put a mark on Cain to warn everyone not to kill him.
Genesis,4,16,"But Cain had to go far from the LORD and live in the Land of Wandering, which is east of Eden."
Genesis,4,17,"Later, Cain and his wife had a son named Enoch. At the time Cain was building a town, and so he named it Enoch after his son."
Genesis,4,18,"Then Enoch had a son named Irad, who had a son named Mehujael, who had a son named Methushael, who had a son named Lamech."
Genesis,4,19,"Lamech married Adah, then Zillah."
Genesis,7,1,"The LORD told Noah: Take your whole family with you into the boat, because you are the only one on this earth who pleases me."
Genesis,7,2,Take seven pairs of every kind of animal that can be used for sacrifice and one pair of all others.
Genesis,7,3,Also take seven pairs of every kind of bird with you. Do this so there will always be animals and birds on the earth.
Genesis,7,4,"Seven days from now I will send rain that will last for forty days and nights, and I will destroy all other living creatures I have made."
Genesis,8,1,"God did not forget about Noah and the animals with him in the boat. So God made a wind blow, and the water started going down."
Genesis,8,2,"God stopped up the places where the water had been gushing out from under the earth. He also closed up the sky, and the rain stopped."
Genesis,8,3,For one hundred and fifty days the water slowly went down.
Genesis,8,4,"Then on the seventeenth day of the seventh month of the year, the boat came to rest somewhere in the Ararat mountains."
Genesis,8,5,"The water kept going down, and the mountain tops could be seen on the first day of the tenth month."
Genesis,9,1,"God said to Noah and his sons: I am giving you my blessing. Have a lot of children and grandchildren, so people will live everywhere on this earth."
Genesis,9,2,"All animals, birds, reptiles, and fish will be afraid of you. I have placed them under your control,"
Genesis,9,3,"and I have given them to you for food. From now on, you may eat them, as well as the green plants that you have always eaten."
Genesis,9,4,"But life is in the blood, and you must not eat any meat that still has blood in it."
Genesis,10,1,"After the flood Shem, Ham, and Japheth had many descendants."
Genesis,11,1,"At first everyone spoke the same language,"
Genesis,11,2,"but after some of them moved from the east and settled in Babylonia,"
Genesis,12,1,"The LORD said to Abram: Leave your country, your family, and your relatives and go to the land that I will show you."
Genesis,12,2,I will bless you and make your descendants into a great nation. You will become famous and be a blessing to others.
Genesis,12,3,"I will bless anyone who blesses you, but I will put a curse on anyone who puts a curse on you. Everyone on earth will be blessed because of you."
Genesis,13,1,Abram and Sarai took everything they owned and went to the Southern Desert. Lot went with them.
Genesis,13,2,"Abram was very rich. He owned many cattle, sheep, and goats, and had a lot of silver and gold."
Genesis,13,3,"Abram moved from place to place in the Southern Desert. And finally, he went north and set up his tents between Bethel and Ai,"
Genesis,13,4,where he had earlier camped and built an altar. There he worshipped the LORD.
Genesis,13,5,"Lot, who was travelling with him, also had sheep, goats, and cattle, as well as his own family and slaves."
Genesis,14,1,"About this time, King Amraphel of Babylonia, King Arioch of Ellasar, King Chedorlaomer of Elam, and King Tidal of Goiim"
Genesis,14,2,"attacked King Bera of Sodom, King Birsha of Gomorrah, King Shinab of Admah, King Shemeber of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, also known as the city of Zoar."
Genesis,15,1,"Later the LORD spoke to Abram in a vision, “Abram, don't be afraid! I will protect you and reward you greatly.”"
Genesis,15,2,"But Abram answered, “ LORD All-Powerful, you have given me everything I could ask for, except children. And when I die, Eliezer of Damascus will get all I own."
Genesis,15,3,"You have not given me any children, and this servant of mine will inherit everything.”"
Genesis,15,4,"The LORD replied, “No, he won't! You will have a son of your own, and everything you have will be his.”"
Genesis,15,5,"Then the LORD took Abram outside and said, “Look at the sky and see if you can count the stars. That's how many descendants you will have.”"
Genesis,15,6,"Abram believed the LORD , and the LORD was pleased with him."
Genesis,15,7,"The LORD said to Abram, “I brought you here from Ur in Chaldea, and I gave you this land.”"
Genesis,15,8,"Abram asked, “ LORD God, how can I know the land will be mine?”"
Genesis,15,9,"Then the LORD told him, “Bring me a three-year-old cow, a three-year-old female goat, a three-year-old ram, a dove, and a young pigeon.”"
Genesis,15,10,Abram obeyed the LORD . Then he cut the animals in half and laid the two halves of each animal opposite each other on the ground. But he did not cut the doves and pigeons in half.
Genesis,15,11,"And when birds came down to eat the animals, Abram chased them away."
Genesis,15,12,"As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and everything became dark and frightening."
Genesis,16,1,"Abram's wife Sarai had not been able to have any children. But she owned a young Egyptian slave woman named Hagar,"
Genesis,16,2,"and Sarai said to Abram, “The LORD has not given me any children. Sleep with my slave, and if she has a child, it will be mine.” Abram agreed,"
Genesis,16,3,and Sarai gave him Hagar to be his wife. This happened after Abram had lived in the land of Canaan for ten years.
Genesis,16,4,"Later, when Hagar knew she was going to have a baby, she became proud and was hateful to Sarai."
Genesis,16,5,"Then Sarai said to Abram, “It's all your fault! I gave you my slave woman, but she has been hateful to me ever since she found out she was pregnant. You have done me wrong, and you will have to answer to the LORD for this.”"
Genesis,16,6,"Abram said, “All right! She's your slave, and you can do whatever you want with her.” But Sarai began treating Hagar so harshly that she finally ran away."
Genesis,16,7,"Hagar stopped to rest at a spring in the desert on the road to Shur. While she was there, the angel of the LORD came to her"
Genesis,16,8,"and asked, “Hagar, where have you come from, and where are you going?” She answered, “I'm running away from Sarai, my owner.”"
Genesis,16,9,"The angel said, “Go back to Sarai and be her slave."
Genesis,17,1,"Abram was ninety-nine years old when the LORD appeared to him again and said, “I am God All-Powerful. If you obey me and always do right,"
Genesis,17,2,I will keep my solemn promise to you and give you more descendants than can be counted.”
Genesis,17,3,"Abram bowed with his face to the ground, and God said:"
Genesis,18,1,"One hot summer afternoon Abraham was sitting by the entrance to his tent near the sacred trees of Mamre, when the LORD appeared to him."
Genesis,18,2,"Abraham looked up and saw three men standing nearby. He quickly ran to meet them, bowed with his face to the ground,"
Genesis,18,3,"and said, “Please come to my home where I can serve you."
Genesis,18,4,"I'll have some water brought, so you can wash your feet, then you can rest under the tree."
Genesis,18,5,"Let me get you some food to give you strength before you leave. I would be honoured to serve you.” “Thank you very much,” they answered. “We accept your offer.”"
Genesis,18,6,"Abraham quickly went to his tent and said to Sarah, “Hurry! Get a large sack of flour and make some bread.”"
Genesis,18,7,"After saying this, he rushed off to his herd of cattle and picked out one of the best calves, which his servant quickly prepared."
Genesis,18,8,"He then served his guests some yoghurt and milk together with the meat. While they were eating, he stood near them under the trees,"
Genesis,18,9,"and they asked, “Where is your wife Sarah?” “She is there in the tent,” Abraham answered."
Genesis,18,10,"One of the guests was the LORD , and he said, “I'll come back about this time next year, and when I do, Sarah will already have a son.” Sarah was behind Abraham, listening at the entrance to the tent."
Genesis,18,11,"Abraham and Sarah were very old, and Sarah was well past the age for having children."
Genesis,18,12,"So she laughed and said to herself, “Now that I am worn out and my husband is old, will I really know such happiness?”"
Genesis,18,13,"The LORD asked Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh? Does she doubt that she can have a child in her old age?"
Genesis,18,14,"I am the LORD ! There is nothing too difficult for me. I'll come back next year at the time I promised, and Sarah will already have a son.”"
Genesis,18,15,"Sarah was so frightened that she lied and said, “I didn't laugh.” “Yes, you did!” he answered."
Genesis,18,16,"When the three men got ready to leave, they looked down towards Sodom, and Abraham walked part of the way with them."
Genesis,18,17,"The LORD said to himself, “I should tell Abraham what I am going to do,"
Genesis,18,18,since his family will become a great and powerful nation that will be a blessing to all other nations on earth.
Genesis,18,19,"I have chosen him to teach his family to obey me for ever and to do what is right and fair. Then I will give Abraham many descendants, just as I promised.”"
Genesis,18,20,"The LORD said, “Abraham, I have heard that the people of Sodom and Gomorrah are doing all kinds of evil things."
Genesis,18,21,"Now I am going down to see for myself if those people really are that bad. If they aren't, I want to know about it.”"
Genesis,18,22,"The men turned and started towards Sodom. But the LORD stayed with Abraham,"
Genesis,18,23,"who asked, “ LORD , when you destroy the evil people, are you also going to destroy those who are good?"
Genesis,18,24,Wouldn't you spare the city if there are only fifty good people in it?
Genesis,18,25,"You surely wouldn't let them be killed when you destroy the evil ones. You are the judge of all the earth, and you do what is right.”"
Genesis,18,26,"The LORD replied, “If I find fifty good people in Sodom, I will save the city to keep them from being killed.”"
Genesis,18,27,"Abraham answered, “I am nothing more than the dust of the earth. Please forgive me, LORD , for daring to speak to you like this."
Genesis,18,28,"But suppose there are only forty-five good people in Sodom. Would you still wipe out the whole city?” “If I find forty-five good people,” the LORD replied, “I won't destroy the city.”"
Genesis,18,29,"“Suppose there are just forty good people?” Abraham asked. “Even for them,” the LORD replied, “I won't destroy the city.”"
Genesis,18,30,"Abraham said, “Please don't be angry, LORD , if I ask you what you will do if there are only thirty good people in the city.” “If I find thirty,” the LORD replied, “I still won't destroy it.”"
Genesis,18,31,"Then Abraham said, “I don't have any right to ask you, LORD , but what would you do if you find only twenty?” “Because of them, I won't destroy the city,” was the LORD 's answer."
Genesis,18,32,"Finally, Abraham said, “Please don't get angry, LORD , if I speak just once more. Suppose you find only ten good people there.” “For the sake of ten good people,” the LORD told him, “I still won't destroy the city.”"
Genesis,18,33,"After speaking with Abraham, the LORD left, and Abraham went back home."
Genesis,19,1,"That evening the two angels arrived in Sodom, while Lot was sitting near the city gate. When Lot saw them, he got up, bowed down low,"
Genesis,19,2,"and said, “Gentlemen, I am your servant. Please come to my home. You can wash your feet, spend the night, and be on your way in the morning.” They told him, “No, we'll spend the night in the city square.”"
Genesis,19,3,"But Lot kept insisting, until they finally agreed and went home with him. He baked some bread, cooked a meal, and they ate."
Genesis,19,4,"Before Lot and his guests could go to bed, every man in Sodom, young and old, came and stood outside his house"
Genesis,19,5,"and started shouting, “Where are your visitors? Send them out, so we can have sex with them!”"
Genesis,19,6,Lot went outside and shut the door behind him.
Genesis,19,7,"Then he said, “Friends, please don't do such a terrible thing!"
Genesis,19,8,"I have two daughters who have never been married. I'll bring them out, and you can do what you want with them. But don't harm these men. They are guests in my home.”"
Genesis,19,9,"“Don't get in our way,” the crowd answered. “You're an outsider. What right do you have to order us around? We'll do worse things to you than we're going to do to them.” The crowd kept arguing with Lot. Finally, they rushed towards the door to break it down."
Genesis,19,10,But the two angels in the house reached out and pulled Lot safely inside.
Genesis,19,11,"Then they struck everyone in the crowd blind, and none of them could even find the door."
Genesis,20,1,"Abraham moved to the Southern Desert, where he settled between Kadesh and Shur. Later he went to Gerar, and while there"
Genesis,20,2,he told everyone that his wife Sarah was his sister. So King Abimelech of Gerar had Sarah brought to him.
Genesis,20,3,"But God came to Abimelech in a dream and said, “You have taken a married woman, and for this you will die!”"
Genesis,21,1,The LORD was good to Sarah and kept his promise.
Genesis,21,2,"Although Abraham was very old, Sarah had a son exactly at the time God had said."
Genesis,21,3,"Abraham named his son Isaac,"
Genesis,21,4,"and when the boy was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him, just as the LORD had commanded."
Genesis,21,5,"Abraham was a hundred years old when Isaac was born,"
Genesis,21,6,"and Sarah said, “God has made me laugh. Now everyone will laugh with me."
Genesis,21,7,"Who would have dared to tell Abraham that some day I would have a child? But in his old age, I have given him a son.”"
Genesis,21,8,"The time came when Sarah no longer had to nurse Isaac, and on that day Abraham gave a big feast."
Genesis,22,1,"Some years later God decided to test Abraham, so he spoke to him. Abraham answered, “Here I am, LORD .”"
Genesis,22,2,"The LORD said, “Go and get Isaac, your only son, the one you dearly love! Take him to the land of Moriah, and I will show you a mountain where you must sacrifice him to me on the fires of an altar.”"
Genesis,22,3,So Abraham got up early the next morning and chopped wood for the fire. He put a saddle on his donkey and left with Isaac and two servants for the place where God had told him to go.
Genesis,22,4,Three days later Abraham looked into the distance and saw the place.
Genesis,22,5,"He told his servants, “Stay here with the donkey, while my son and I go over there to worship. We will come back.”"
Genesis,22,6,"Abraham put the wood on Isaac's shoulder, but he carried the hot coals and the knife. As the two of them walked along,"
Genesis,24,1,"Abraham was now a very old man. The LORD had made him rich, and he was successful in everything he did."
Genesis,24,2,"One day, Abraham called in his most trusted servant and said to him, “Solemnly promise me"
Genesis,24,3,"in the name of the LORD , who rules heaven and earth, that you won't choose a wife for my son Isaac from the people here in the land of Canaan."
Genesis,24,4,"Instead, go back to the land where I was born and find a wife for him from among my relatives.”"
Genesis,24,5,"But the servant asked, “What if the young woman I choose refuses to leave home and come here with me? Should I send Isaac there to look for a wife?”"
Genesis,24,6,"“No!” Abraham answered. “Don't ever do that, no matter what."
Genesis,24,7,"The LORD who rules heaven brought me here from the land where I was born and promised that he would give this land to my descendants for ever. When you go back there, the LORD will send his angel ahead of you to help you find a wife for my son."
Genesis,24,8,"If the woman refuses to come along, you don't have to keep this promise. But don't ever take my son back there.”"
Genesis,24,9,So the servant gave Abraham his word that he would do everything he had been told to do.
Genesis,24,10,"Soon after that, the servant loaded ten of Abraham's camels with valuable gifts. Then he set out for the city in northern Syria, where Abraham's brother Nahor lived."
Genesis,24,11,"When he got there, he let the camels rest near the well outside the city. It was late afternoon, the time when the women came out for water."
Genesis,24,12,"The servant prayed: You, LORD , are the God my master Abraham worships. Please keep your promise to him and let me find a wife for Isaac today."
Genesis,24,13,"The young women of the city will soon come to this well for water,"
Genesis,24,14,"and I'll ask one of them for a drink. If she gives me a drink and then offers to get some water for my camels, I'll know she is the one you have chosen and that you have kept your promise to my master."
Genesis,25,1,"Abraham married Keturah,"
Genesis,25,2,"and they had six sons: Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah."
Genesis,25,3,"Later, Jokshan became the father of Sheba and Dedan, and when Dedan grew up, he had three sons: Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim."
Genesis,25,4,"Midian also had five sons: Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah."
Genesis,26,1,"Once during Abraham's lifetime, the fields had not produced enough grain, and now the same thing happened. So Isaac went to King Abimelech of the Philistines in the land of Gerar,"
Genesis,26,2,"because the LORD had appeared to Isaac and said: Isaac, stay away from Egypt! I will show you where I want you to go."
Genesis,26,3,"You will live there as a foreigner, but I will be with you and bless you. I will keep my promise to your father Abraham by giving this land to you and your descendants."
Genesis,26,4,"I will give you as many descendants as there are stars in the sky, and I will give your descendants all this land. They will be a blessing to every nation on earth,"
Genesis,26,5,because Abraham did everything I told him to do.
Genesis,26,6,Isaac moved to Gerar
Genesis,26,7,"with his beautiful wife Rebekah. He was afraid that someone might kill him to get her, and so he told everyone that Rebekah was his sister."
Genesis,26,8,"After Isaac had been there a long time, King Abimelech looked out of a window and saw Isaac hugging and kissing Rebekah."
Genesis,26,9,"Abimelech called him in and said, “Rebekah must be your wife! Why did you say she is your sister?” “Because I thought someone would kill me,” Isaac answered."
Genesis,26,10,"“Don't you know what you've done?” Abimelech exclaimed. “If someone had slept with her, you would have made our whole nation guilty!”"
Genesis,26,11,Then Abimelech warned his people that anyone who even touched Isaac or Rebekah would be put to death.
Genesis,26,12,"Isaac planted grain and had a good harvest that same year. The LORD blessed him,"
Genesis,26,13,and Isaac was so successful that he became very rich.
Genesis,26,14,"In fact, the Philistines were jealous of the large number of sheep, goats, and slaves that Isaac owned,"
Genesis,26,15,and they stopped up the wells that Abraham's servants had dug before his death.
Genesis,26,16,"Finally, Abimelech said, “Isaac, I want you to leave our country. You have become too powerful to stay here.”"
Genesis,26,17,"Isaac left and settled in Gerar Valley,"
Genesis,26,18,where he cleaned out those wells that the Philistines had stopped up. Isaac also gave each of the wells the same name that Abraham had given to them.
Genesis,26,19,"While his servants were digging in the valley, they found a spring-fed well."
Genesis,26,20,"But the shepherds of Gerar Valley quarrelled with Isaac's shepherds and claimed the water belonged to them. So the well was named “Quarrel”, because they had quarrelled with Isaac."
Genesis,26,21,"Isaac's servants dug another well, and the shepherds also quarrelled about it. So that well was named “Jealous”."
Genesis,26,22,"Finally, they dug one more well. There was no quarrelling this time, and the well was named “Lots of Room”, because the LORD had given them room and would make them very successful."
Genesis,26,23,"Isaac went on to Beersheba,"
Genesis,26,24,"where the LORD appeared to him that night and told him, “Don't be afraid! I am the God who was worshipped by your father Abraham, my servant. I will be with you and bless you, and because of Abraham I will give you many descendants.”"
Genesis,26,25,"Isaac built an altar there and worshipped the LORD . Then he set up camp, and his servants started digging a well."
Genesis,26,26,"Meanwhile, Abimelech had left Gerar and was taking his adviser Ahuzzath and his army commander Phicol to see Isaac."
Genesis,26,27,"When they arrived, Isaac asked, “Why are you here? Didn't you send me away because you hated me?”"
Genesis,26,28,"They answered, “We now know for certain that the LORD is with you, and we have decided there needs to be a peace treaty between you and us. So let's make a solemn agreement"
Genesis,26,29,"not to harm each other. Remember, we have never hurt you, and when we sent you away, we let you go in peace. The LORD has truly blessed you.”"
Genesis,26,30,"Isaac gave a big feast for them, and everyone ate and drank."
Genesis,26,31,"Early the next morning Isaac and the others made a solemn agreement, then he let them go in peace."
Genesis,26,32,"Later that same day Isaac's servants came and said, “We've struck water!”"
Genesis,26,33,"So Isaac named the well Shibah, and the town is still called Beersheba."
Genesis,26,34,"When Esau was forty, he married Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite."
Genesis,26,35,But these two women brought a lot of grief to his parents Isaac and Rebekah.
Genesis,27,1,"After Isaac had become old and almost blind, he called in his firstborn son Esau, who asked him, “Father, what can I do for you?”"
Genesis,27,2,"Isaac replied, “I am old and might die at any time."
Genesis,27,3,"So take your bow and arrows, then go out in the fields, and kill a wild animal."
Genesis,27,4,Cook some of that tasty food that I love so much and bring it to me. I want to eat it once more and give you my blessing before I die.”
Genesis,27,5,"Rebekah had been listening, and as soon as Esau left to go hunting,"
Genesis,27,6,"she said to Jacob, “I heard your father tell Esau"
Genesis,27,7,to kill a wild animal and cook some tasty food for your father before he dies. Your father said this because he wants to bless your brother with the LORD as his witness.
Genesis,27,8,"Now, my son, listen carefully to what I want you to do."
Genesis,27,9,Go and kill two of your best young goats and bring them to me. I'll cook the tasty food that your father loves so much.
Genesis,27,10,"Then you can take it to him, so he can eat it and give you his blessing before he dies.”"
Genesis,27,11,"“My brother Esau is a hairy man,” Jacob reminded her. “And I am not."
Genesis,27,12,"If my father touches me and realizes I am trying to trick him, he will put a curse on me instead of giving me a blessing.”"
Genesis,27,13,"Rebekah insisted, “Let his curse fall on me! Just do what I say and bring me the meat.”"
Genesis,27,14,"So Jacob brought the meat to his mother, and she cooked the tasty food that his father liked."
Genesis,27,15,Then she took Esau's best clothes and put them on Jacob.
Genesis,27,16,She also covered the smooth part of his hands and neck with goatskins
Genesis,27,17,and gave him some bread and the tasty food she had cooked.
Genesis,27,18,"Jacob went to his father and said, “Father, here I am.” “Which one of my sons are you?” his father asked."
Genesis,27,19,"Jacob replied, “I am Esau, your firstborn, and I have done what you told me. Please sit up and eat the meat I have brought. Then you can give me your blessing.”"
Genesis,27,20,"Isaac asked, “My son, how did you find an animal so quickly?” “The LORD your God was kind to me,” Jacob answered."
Genesis,27,21,"“My son,” Isaac said, “come closer, where I can touch you and find out if you really are Esau.”"
Genesis,27,22,"Jacob went closer. His father touched him and said, “You sound like Jacob, but your hands feel hairy like Esau's.”"
Genesis,27,23,"And so Isaac blessed Jacob, thinking he was Esau."
Genesis,27,24,"Isaac asked, “Are you really my son Esau?” “Yes, I am,” Jacob answered."
Genesis,27,25,"So Isaac told him, “Serve me the wild meat, and I can give you my blessing.” Jacob gave him some meat, and he ate it. He also gave him some wine, and he drank it."
Genesis,27,26,"Then Isaac said, “Son, come over here and kiss me.”"
Genesis,27,27,"While Jacob was kissing him, Isaac caught the smell of his clothes and said: “The smell of my son is like a field the LORD has blessed."
Genesis,27,28,"God will bless you, my son, with dew from heaven and with fertile fields, rich with grain and grapes."
Genesis,27,29,"Nations will be your servants and bow down to you. You will rule over your brothers, and they will kneel at your feet. Anyone who curses you will be cursed; anyone who blesses you will be blessed.”"
Genesis,27,30,"Straight after Isaac had given Jacob his blessing and Jacob had gone, Esau came back from hunting."
Genesis,27,31,"He cooked the tasty food, brought it to his father, and said, “Father, please sit up and eat the meat I have brought you, so you can give me your blessing.”"
Genesis,27,32,"“Who are you?” Isaac asked. “I am Esau, your firstborn son.”"
Genesis,27,33,"Isaac started trembling and said, “Then who brought me some wild meat just before you came in? I ate it and gave him a blessing that cannot be taken back.”"
Genesis,27,34,"Esau cried loudly and begged, “Father, give me a blessing too!”"
Genesis,27,35,"Isaac answered, “Your brother tricked me and stole your blessing.”"
Genesis,27,36,"Esau replied, “My brother deserves the name Jacob, because he has already cheated me twice. The first time he cheated me out of my rights as the firstborn son, and now he has cheated me out of my blessing.” Then Esau asked his father, “Don't you still have any blessing left for me?”"
Genesis,27,37,"“My son,” Isaac answered, “I have made Jacob the ruler over you and your brothers, and all of you will be his servants. I have also promised him all the grain and grapes that he needs. There's nothing left that I can do for you.”"
Genesis,27,38,"“Father,” Esau asked, “don't you have more than one blessing? You can surely give me a blessing too!” Then Esau started crying again."
Genesis,27,39,"So his father said: “Your home will be far from that fertile land, where dew comes down from the heavens."
Genesis,27,40,"You will live by the power of your sword and be your brother's slave. But when you decide to be free, you will break loose.”"
Genesis,27,41,"Esau hated his brother Jacob because he had stolen the blessing that was supposed to be his. So he said to himself, “Just as soon as my father dies, I'll kill Jacob.”"
Genesis,27,42,"When Rebekah found out what Esau planned to do, she sent for Jacob and told him, “Son, your brother Esau is just waiting for the time when he can kill you."
Genesis,27,43,Now listen carefully and do what I say. Go to the home of my brother Laban in Haran
Genesis,27,44,and stay with him for a while. When Esau stops being angry
Genesis,27,45,"and forgets what you have done to him, I'll send for you to come home. Why should I lose both of my sons on the same day?”"
Genesis,27,46,"Rebekah later told Isaac, “Those Hittite wives of Esau are making my life miserable! If Jacob marries a Hittite woman, I'd be better off dead.”"
Genesis,28,1,"Isaac called in Jacob, then gave him a blessing, and said: Don't marry any of those Canaanite women."
Genesis,28,2,"Go at once to your mother's father Bethuel in northern Syria and choose a wife from one of the daughters of Laban, your mother's brother."
Genesis,28,3,I pray that God All-Powerful will bless you with many descendants and let you become a great nation.
Genesis,28,4,"May he bless you with the land he gave Abraham, so that you will take over this land where we now live as foreigners."
Genesis,28,5,"Isaac then sent Jacob to stay with Rebekah's brother Laban, the son of Bethuel the Aramean."
Genesis,28,6,Esau found out that his father Isaac had blessed Jacob and had warned him not to marry any of the Canaanite women. He also learnt that Jacob had been sent to find a wife in northern Syria
Genesis,28,7,and that he had obeyed his father and mother.
Genesis,28,8,"Esau already had several wives, but he realized at last how much his father hated the Canaanite women."
Genesis,28,9,"So he married Ishmael's daughter Mahalath, who was the sister of Nebaioth and the granddaughter of Abraham."
Genesis,28,10,Jacob left the town of Beersheba and started out for Haran.
Genesis,28,11,"At sunset he stopped for the night and went to sleep, resting his head on a large rock."
Genesis,28,12,"In a dream he saw a ladder that reached from earth to heaven, and God's angels were going up and down on it."
Genesis,28,13,The LORD was standing beside the ladder and said: I am the LORD God who was worshipped by Abraham and Isaac. I will give to you and your family the land on which you are now sleeping.
Genesis,28,14,Your descendants will spread over the earth in all directions and will become as numerous as the specks of dust. Your family will be a blessing to all people.
Genesis,28,15,"Wherever you go, I will watch over you, then later I will bring you back to this land. I won't leave you—I will do all I have promised."
Genesis,28,16,"Jacob woke up suddenly and thought, “The LORD is in this place, and I didn't even know it.”"
Genesis,28,17,"Then Jacob became frightened and said, “This is a fearsome place! It must be the house of God and the ladder to heaven.”"
Genesis,28,18,"When Jacob got up early the next morning, he took the rock that he had used for a pillow and stood it up for a place of worship. Then he poured olive oil on the rock to dedicate it to God,"
Genesis,28,19,and he named the place Bethel. Before that it had been named Luz.
Genesis,28,20,"Jacob solemnly promised God, “If you go with me and watch over me as I travel, and if you give me food and clothes"
Genesis,28,21,"and bring me safely home again, you will be my God."
Genesis,28,22,"This rock will be your house, and I will give back to you a tenth of everything you give me.”"
Genesis,29,1,"As Jacob continued on his way to the east,"
Genesis,29,2,"he looked out in a field and saw a well where shepherds took their sheep for water. Three flocks of sheep were lying around the well, which was covered with a large rock."
Genesis,29,3,"Shepherds would roll the rock away when all their sheep had gathered there. Then after the sheep had been watered, the shepherds would roll the rock back over the mouth of the well."
Genesis,29,4,"Jacob asked the shepherds, “Where are you from?” “We're from Haran,” they answered."
Genesis,29,5,"Then he asked, “Do you know Nahor's grandson Laban?” “Yes we do,” they replied."
Genesis,29,6,"“How is he?” Jacob asked. “He's fine,” they answered. “And here comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep.”"
Genesis,29,7,"Jacob told them, “Look, the sun is still high up in the sky, and it's too early to bring in the rest of the flocks. Water your sheep and take them back to the pasture.”"
Genesis,29,8,"But they replied, “We can't do that until they all get here, and the rock has been rolled away from the well.”"
Genesis,29,9,"While Jacob was still talking with the men, his cousin Rachel came up with her father's sheep."
Genesis,29,10,"When Jacob saw her and his uncle's sheep, he rolled the rock away and watered the sheep."
Genesis,29,11,He then kissed Rachel and started crying because he was so happy.
Genesis,29,12,"He told her that he was the son of her aunt Rebekah, and she ran and told her father about him."
Genesis,29,13,"As soon as Laban heard the news, he ran out to meet Jacob. He hugged and kissed him and brought him to his home, where Jacob told him everything that had happened."
Genesis,29,14,"Laban said, “You are my nephew, and you are like one of my own family.” After Jacob had been there for a month,"
Genesis,29,15,"Laban said to him, “You shouldn't have to work without pay, just because you are a relative of mine. What do you want me to give you?”"
Genesis,30,1,"Rachel was very jealous of Leah for having children, and she said to Jacob, “I'll die if you don't give me some children!”"
Genesis,30,2,"But Jacob became upset with Rachel and answered, “Don't blame me! I'm not God.”"
Genesis,30,3,"“Here, take my servant Bilhah,” Rachel told him. “Have children by her, and I'll let them be born on my knees to show that they are mine.”"
Genesis,30,4,"Then Rachel let Jacob marry Bilhah,"
Genesis,30,5,and they had a son.
Genesis,30,6,"Rachel named him Dan, because she said, “God has answered my prayers. He has judged me and given me a son.”"
Genesis,30,7,"When Bilhah and Jacob had a second son,"
Genesis,30,8,"Rachel said, “I've struggled hard with my sister, and I've won!” So she named the boy Naphtali."
Genesis,30,9,"When Leah realized she could not have any more children, she let Jacob marry her servant Zilpah,"
Genesis,30,10,and they had a son.
Genesis,30,11,"“I'm really lucky,” Leah said, and she named the boy Gad."
Genesis,30,12,"When they had another son,"
Genesis,30,13,"Leah exclaimed, “I'm happy now, and all the women will say how happy I am.” So she named him Asher."
Genesis,30,14,"During the time of the wheat harvest, Reuben found some love flowers and took them to his mother Leah. Rachel asked Leah for some of them,"
Genesis,30,15,"but Leah said, “It's bad enough that you stole my husband! Now you want my son's love flowers too.” “All right,” Rachel answered. “Let me have the flowers, and you can sleep with Jacob tonight.”"
Genesis,30,16,"That evening when Jacob came in from the fields, Leah told him, “You're sleeping with me tonight. I hired you with my son's love flowers.” They slept together that night,"
Genesis,30,17,and God answered Leah's prayers by giving her a fifth son.
Genesis,30,18,"Leah shouted, “God has rewarded me for letting Jacob marry my servant,” and she named the boy Issachar."
Genesis,30,19,"When Leah had another son,"
Genesis,30,20,"she exclaimed, “God has given me a wonderful gift, and my husband will praise me for giving him six sons.” So she named the boy Zebulun."
Genesis,30,21,"Later, Leah had a daughter and named her Dinah."
Genesis,31,1,"Jacob heard that Laban's sons were complaining, “Jacob is now a rich man, and he got everything he owns from our father.”"
Genesis,31,2,Jacob also noticed that Laban was not as friendly as he had been before.
Genesis,31,3,"One day the LORD said, “Jacob, go back to your relatives in the land of your ancestors, and I will bless you.”"
Genesis,31,4,"Jacob sent for Rachel and Leah to meet him in the field where he kept his sheep,"
Genesis,31,5,"and he told them: Your father isn't as friendly with me as he used to be, but the God my ancestors worshipped has been on my side."
Genesis,31,6,You know that I have worked hard for your father
Genesis,31,7,and that he keeps cheating me by changing my wages time after time. But God has protected me.
Genesis,31,8,"When your father said the speckled sheep would be my wages, all of them were speckled. And when he said the spotted ones would be mine, all of them were spotted."
Genesis,31,9,That's how God has taken sheep and goats from your father and given them to me.
Genesis,31,10,"Once, when the flocks were mating, I dreamed that all the rams were either spotted or speckled."
Genesis,31,11,"Then God's angel called me by name. I answered,"
Genesis,31,12,"and he said, “Notice that all the rams are either spotted or speckled. I know everything Laban is doing to you,"
Genesis,31,13,"and I am the God you worshipped at Bethel, when you poured olive oil on a rock and made a promise to me. Leave here straight away and return to the land where you were born.”"
Genesis,31,14,Rachel and Leah said to Jacob: There's nothing left for us to inherit from our father.
Genesis,31,15,He treats us like foreigners and has even cheated us out of the bride price that should have been ours.
Genesis,31,16,Now do whatever God tells you to do. Even the property God took from our father and gave to you really belongs to us and our children.
Genesis,31,17,"Then Jacob, his wives, and his children got on camels and left"
Genesis,31,18,"for the home of his father Isaac in Canaan. Jacob took all the flocks, herds, and other property that he had got in northern Syria."
Genesis,31,19,"Before Rachel left, she stole the household idols while Laban was out shearing his sheep."
Genesis,31,20,Jacob tricked Laban the Aramean by not saying that he intended to leave.
Genesis,31,21,"When Jacob crossed the River Euphrates and headed for the hill country of Gilead, he took with him everything he owned."
Genesis,31,22,Three days later Laban found out that Jacob had gone.
Genesis,31,23,"So he took some of his relatives along and chased after Jacob for seven days, before catching up with him in the hill country of Gilead."
Genesis,31,24,"But God appeared to Laban in a dream that night and warned, “Don't say a word to Jacob. Don't make a threat or a promise.”"
Genesis,31,25,"Jacob had set up camp in the hill country of Gilead, when Laban and his relatives came and set up camp in another part of the hill country. Laban went to Jacob"
Genesis,31,26,and said: Look what you've done! You've tricked me and run off with my daughters like a kidnapper.
Genesis,31,27,Why did you sneak away without telling me? I would have given you a going-away party with singing and with music on tambourines and harps.
Genesis,31,28,You didn't even give me a chance to kiss my own grandchildren and daughters goodbye. That was really foolish.
Genesis,31,29,"I could easily hurt you, but the God your father worshipped has warned me not to make any threats or promises."
Genesis,31,30,"I can understand why you were eager to return to your father, but why did you have to steal my idols?"
Genesis,31,31,"Jacob answered, “I left secretly because I was afraid you would take your daughters from me by force."
Genesis,31,32,"If you find that any one of us has taken your idols, I'll have that person killed. Let your relatives be witnesses. Show me what belongs to you, and you can take it back.” Jacob did not realize that Rachel had stolen the household idols."
Genesis,31,33,"Laban searched the tents of Jacob, Leah, and the two servant women, but did not find the idols. Then he started for Rachel's tent."
Genesis,31,34,She had already hidden them in the cushion she used as a saddle and was sitting on it. Laban searched everywhere and did not find them.
Genesis,31,35,"Rachel said, “Father, please don't be angry with me for not getting up; I am having my period.” Laban kept on searching, but still did not find the idols."
Genesis,31,36,Jacob became very angry and said to Laban: What have I done wrong? Have I committed some crime? Is that why you hunted me down?
Genesis,31,37,"After searching through everything I have, did you find anything of yours? If so, put it here, where your relatives and mine can see it. Then we can decide what to do."
Genesis,31,38,"In all the twenty years that I've worked for you, not one of your sheep or goats has had a miscarriage, and I've never eaten even one of your rams."
Genesis,31,39,"If a wild animal killed one of your sheep or goats, I paid for it myself. In fact, you demanded the full price, whether the animal was killed during the day or at night."
Genesis,31,40,"I sweated every day, and I couldn't sleep at night because of the cold."
Genesis,31,41,I had to work fourteen of these twenty long years to earn your two daughters and another six years to buy your sheep and goats. During that time you kept changing my wages.
Genesis,31,42,"If the fearsome God worshipped by Abraham and my father Isaac had not been on my side, you would have sent me away without a thing. But God saw my hard work, and he knew the trouble I was in, so he helped me. Then last night he told you how wrong you were."
Genesis,31,43,"Laban said to Jacob, “Leah and Rachel are my daughters, and their children belong to me. All these sheep you are taking are really mine too. In fact, everything you have belongs to me. But there is nothing I can do to keep my daughters and their children."
Genesis,31,44,"So I am ready to make an agreement with you, and we will pile up some large rocks here to remind us of the agreement.”"
Genesis,31,45,"After Jacob had set up a large rock,"
Genesis,31,46,he told his men to get some more rocks and pile them up next to it. Then Jacob and Laban ate a meal together beside the rocks.
Genesis,31,47,Laban named the pile of rocks Jegar Sahadutha. But Jacob named it Galeed.
Genesis,31,48,"Laban said to Jacob, “This pile of rocks will remind us of our agreement.” That's why the place was named Galeed."
Genesis,31,49,"Laban also said, “This pile of rocks means that the LORD will watch us both while we are apart from each other.” So the place was also named Mizpah."
Genesis,31,50,"Then Laban said: If you ill-treat my daughters or marry other women, I may not know about it, but remember, God is watching us!"
Genesis,32,1,"As Jacob was on his way back home, some of God's angels came and met him."
Genesis,32,2,"When Jacob saw them, he said, “This is God's camp.” So he named the place Mahanaim."
Genesis,32,3,"Jacob sent messengers on ahead to Esau, who lived in the land of Seir, also known as Edom."
Genesis,32,4,"Jacob told them to say to Esau, “Master, I am your servant! I have lived with Laban all this time,"
Genesis,32,5,"and now I own cattle, donkeys, and sheep, as well as many slaves. Master, I am sending these messengers in the hope that you will be kind to me.”"
Genesis,32,6,"When the messengers returned, they told Jacob, “We went to your brother Esau, and now he is heading this way with four hundred men.”"
Genesis,32,7,"Jacob was so frightened that he divided his people, sheep, cattle, and camels into two groups."
Genesis,32,8,"He thought, “If Esau attacks one group, perhaps the other can escape.”"
Genesis,32,9,"Then Jacob prayed: You, LORD , are the God who was worshipped by my grandfather Abraham and by my father Isaac. You told me to return home to my family, and you promised to be with me and make me successful."
Genesis,32,10,"I don't deserve all the good things you have done for me, your servant. When I first crossed the Jordan, I had only my walking stick, but now I have two large groups of people and animals."
Genesis,32,11,"Please rescue me from my brother. I am afraid he will come and attack not only me, but my wives and children as well."
Genesis,32,12,But you have promised that I would be a success and that some day it will be as hard to count my descendants as it is to count the stars in the sky.
Genesis,32,13,"After Jacob had spent the night there, he chose some animals as gifts for Esau:"
Genesis,33,1,Later that day Jacob met Esau coming with his four hundred men. So Jacob made his children walk with their mothers.
Genesis,33,2,"The two servant women, Zilpah and Bilhah, together with their children went first, followed by Leah and her children, then by Rachel and Joseph."
Genesis,33,3,"Jacob himself walked in front of them all, bowing to the ground seven times as he came near his brother."
Genesis,33,4,But Esau ran towards Jacob and hugged and kissed him. Then the two brothers started crying.
Genesis,33,5,"When Esau noticed the women and children he asked, “Whose children are these?” Jacob answered, “These are the ones the LORD has been kind enough to give to me, your servant.”"
Genesis,33,6,Then the two servant women and their children came and bowed down to Esau.
Genesis,33,7,"Next, Leah and her children came and bowed down; finally, Joseph and Rachel also came and bowed down."
Genesis,33,8,"Esau asked Jacob, “What did you mean by these herds I met along the road?” “Master,” Jacob answered, “I sent them so that you would be friendly to me.”"
Genesis,33,9,"“But, brother, I already have plenty,” Esau replied. “Keep them for yourself.”"
Genesis,33,10,"“No!” Jacob said. “Please accept these gifts as a sign of your friendship for me. When you welcomed me and I saw your face, it was like seeing the face of God."
Genesis,33,11,"Please accept these gifts I brought to you. God has been good to me, and I have everything I need.” Jacob kept insisting until Esau accepted the gifts."
Genesis,33,12,"“Let's get ready to travel,” Esau said. “I'll go along with you.”"
Genesis,33,13,"But Jacob answered, “Master, you know travelling is hard on children, and I have to look after the sheep and goats that are nursing their young. If my animals travel too much in one day, they will all die."
Genesis,33,14,"Why don't you go on ahead and let me travel along slowly with the children, the herds, and the flocks. We can meet again in the country of Edom.”"
Genesis,33,15,"Esau replied, “Let me leave some of my men with you.” “You don't have to do that,” Jacob answered. “I am happy, simply knowing that you are friendly to me.”"
Genesis,33,16,So Esau left for Edom.
Genesis,33,17,"But Jacob went to Succoth, where he built a house for himself and set up shelters for his animals. That's why the place is called Succoth."
Genesis,33,18,"After leaving northern Syria, Jacob arrived safely at Shechem in Canaan and set up camp outside the city."
Genesis,33,19,"The land where he camped was owned by the descendants of Hamor, the father of Shechem. So Jacob paid them one hundred pieces of silver for the property,"
Genesis,33,20,then he set up his tents and built an altar there to honour the God of Israel.
Genesis,34,1,"Dinah, the daughter of Jacob and Leah, went to visit some of the women who lived there."
Genesis,34,2,"She was seen by Hamor's son Shechem, the leader of the Hivites, and he grabbed her and raped her."
Genesis,34,3,"But Shechem was attracted to Dinah, so he told her how much he loved her."
Genesis,34,4,He even asked his father to get her for his wife.
Genesis,34,5,"Meanwhile, Jacob heard what had happened. But his sons were out in the fields with the cattle, so he did not do anything at the time."
Genesis,34,6,Hamor arrived at Jacob's home
Genesis,34,7,"just as Jacob's sons were coming in from work. When they learnt that their sister had been raped, they became furiously angry. Nothing is more disgraceful than rape, and it should not be tolerated in Israel."
Genesis,34,8,Hamor said to Jacob and his sons: My son Shechem really loves Dinah. Please let him marry her.
Genesis,34,9,Why don't you start letting your families marry into our families and ours marry into yours?
Genesis,34,10,You can share this land with us. Move freely about until you find the property you want; then buy it and settle down here.
Genesis,34,11,"Shechem added, “Do this favour for me, and I'll give whatever you want."
Genesis,34,12,"Ask anything, no matter how expensive. I'll do anything, just let me marry Dinah.”"
Genesis,34,13,Jacob's sons wanted to get even with Shechem and his father because of what had happened to their sister.
Genesis,34,14,So they tricked them by saying: You're not circumcised! It would be a disgrace for us to let you marry Dinah now.
Genesis,34,15,"But we will let you marry her, if you and the other men in your tribe get circumcised."
Genesis,34,16,"Then your families can marry into ours, and ours can marry into yours, and we can live together like one nation."
Genesis,34,17,"But if you don't agree to get circumcised, we'll take Dinah and leave this place."
Genesis,34,18,Hamor and Shechem liked what was said.
Genesis,34,19,"Shechem was the most respected person in his family, and he was so in love with Dinah that he hurried off to get everything done."
Genesis,34,20,The two men met with the other leaders of their city and told them:
Genesis,34,21,"These people really are friendly. Why not let them move freely about until they find the property they want? There's enough land here for them and for us. Then our families can marry into theirs, and theirs can marry into ours."
Genesis,34,22,We have to do only one thing before they will agree to stay here and become one nation with us. Our men will have to be circumcised like their men.
Genesis,34,23,"Just think! We'll get their property, as well as their flocks and herds. All we have to do is to agree, and they will live here with us."
Genesis,34,24,Every grown man followed this advice and got circumcised.
Genesis,34,25,"Three days later the men who had been circumcised were still weak from pain. So Simeon and Levi, two of Dinah's brothers, attacked with their swords and killed every man in town,"
Genesis,34,26,including Hamor and Shechem. Then they took Dinah and left.
Genesis,34,27,Jacob's other sons came and took everything they wanted. All this was done because of the horrible thing that had happened to their sister.
Genesis,34,28,"They took sheep, goats, donkeys, and everything else that was in the town or the fields."
Genesis,34,29,"After taking everything of value from the houses, they dragged away the wives and children of their victims."
Genesis,34,30,"Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “Look what you've done! Now I'm in real trouble with the Canaanites and Perizzites who live around here. There aren't many of us, and if they attack, they'll kill everyone in my household.”"
Genesis,34,31,"They answered, “Was it right to let our own sister be treated that way?”"
Genesis,35,1,"God told Jacob, “Return to Bethel, where I appeared to you when you were running from your brother Esau. Make your home there and build an altar for me.”"
Genesis,35,2,Jacob said to his family and to everyone else who was travelling with him: Get rid of your foreign gods! Then make yourselves acceptable to worship God and put on clean clothes.
Genesis,35,3,"Afterwards, we'll go to Bethel. I will build an altar there for God, who answered my prayers when I was in trouble and who has always been at my side."
Genesis,35,4,"So everyone gave Jacob their idols and their earrings, and he buried them under the oak tree near Shechem."
Genesis,35,5,"While Jacob and his family were travelling through Canaan, God terrified the people in the towns so much that no one dared bother them."
Genesis,35,6,"Finally, they reached Bethel, also known as Luz."
Genesis,35,7,"Jacob built an altar there and called it “God of Bethel”, because that was the place where God had appeared to him when he was running from Esau."
Genesis,35,8,"While they were there, Rebekah's personal servant Deborah died. They buried her under an oak tree and called it “Weeping Oak”."
Genesis,36,1,"Esau, also known as Edom, had many descendants."
Genesis,36,2,"He married three Canaanite women: the first was Adah, the daughter of Elon the Hittite; the second was Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah and the granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite;"
Genesis,36,3,"the third was Basemath, who was Ishmael's daughter and Nebaioth's sister."
Genesis,37,1,"Jacob lived in the land of Canaan, where his father Isaac had lived,"
Genesis,37,2,"and this is the story of his family. When Jacob's son Joseph was seventeen years old, he took care of the sheep with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah. But he was always telling his father all sorts of bad things about his brothers."
Genesis,37,3,"Jacob loved Joseph more than he did any of his other sons, because Joseph was born after Jacob was very old. Jacob had given Joseph a fine coat"
Genesis,37,4,"to show that he was his favourite son, and so Joseph's brothers hated him and would not be friendly to him."
Genesis,37,5,"One day, Joseph told his brothers what he had dreamed, and they hated him even more."
Genesis,37,6,"Joseph said, “Let me tell you about my dream."
Genesis,37,7,"We were out in the field, tying up bundles of wheat. Suddenly my bundle stood up, and your bundles gathered around and bowed down to it.”"
Genesis,37,8,"His brothers asked, “Do you really think you are going to be king and rule over us?” Now they hated Joseph more than ever because of what he had said about his dream."
Genesis,37,9,"Joseph later had another dream, and he told his brothers, “Listen to what else I dreamed. The sun, the moon, and eleven stars bowed down to me.”"
Genesis,37,10,"When he told his father about this dream, his father became angry and said, “What's that supposed to mean? Are your mother and I and your brothers all going to come and bow down in front of you?”"
Genesis,37,11,"Joseph's brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept wondering about the dream."
Genesis,37,12,"One day when Joseph's brothers had taken the sheep to a pasture near Shechem,"
Genesis,37,13,"his father Jacob said to him, “I want you to go to your brothers. They are with the sheep near Shechem.” “Yes, sir,” Joseph answered."
Genesis,37,14,"His father said, “Go and find out how your brothers and the sheep are doing. Then come back and let me know.” So he sent him from Hebron Valley. Joseph was near Shechem"
Genesis,37,15,"and wandering through the fields, when a man asked, “What are you looking for?”"
Genesis,37,16,"Joseph answered, “I'm looking for my brothers who are watching the sheep. Can you tell me where they are?”"
Genesis,37,17,"“They're not here any more,” the man replied. “I overheard them say they were going to Dothan.” Joseph left and found his brothers in Dothan."
Genesis,37,18,"But before he got there, they saw him coming and made plans to kill him."
Genesis,37,19,"They said to one another, “Look, here comes the hero of those dreams!"
Genesis,37,20,Let's kill him and throw him into a pit and say that some wild animal ate him. Then we'll see what happens to those dreams.”
Genesis,37,21,"Reuben heard this and tried to protect Joseph from them. “Let's not kill him,” he said."
Genesis,37,22,“Don't murder him or even harm him. Just throw him into a dry well out here in the desert.” Reuben planned to rescue Joseph later and take him back to his father.
Genesis,37,23,"When Joseph came to his brothers, they pulled off his fine coat"
Genesis,37,24,and threw him into a dry well.
Genesis,37,25,"As Joseph's brothers sat down to eat, they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were loaded with all kinds of spices that they were taking to Egypt."
Genesis,37,26,"So Judah said, “What will we gain if we kill our brother and hide his body?"
Genesis,37,27,"Let's sell him to the Ishmaelites and not harm him. After all, he is our brother.” And the others agreed."
Genesis,37,28,"When the Midianite merchants came by, Joseph's brothers took him out of the well, and for twenty pieces of silver they sold him to the Ishmaelites who took him to Egypt."
Genesis,37,29,"When Reuben returned to the well and did not find Joseph there, he tore his clothes in sorrow."
Genesis,37,30,"Then he went back to his brothers and said, “The boy is gone! What am I going to do?”"
Genesis,37,31,Joseph's brothers killed a goat and dipped Joseph's fine coat in its blood.
Genesis,37,32,"After this, they took the coat to their father and said, “We found this! Look at it carefully and see if it belongs to your son.”"
Genesis,37,33,"Jacob knew it was Joseph's coat and said, “It's my son's coat! Joseph has been torn to pieces and eaten by some wild animal.”"
Genesis,37,34,"Jacob mourned for Joseph a long time, and to show his sorrow he tore his clothes and wore sackcloth."
Genesis,37,35,"All Jacob's children came to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. “No,” he said, “I will go to my grave, mourning for my son.” So Jacob kept on grieving."
Genesis,37,36,"Meanwhile, the Midianites had sold Joseph in Egypt to a man named Potiphar, who was the king's official in charge of the palace guard."
Genesis,38,1,About that time Judah left his brothers in the hill country and went to live near his friend Hirah in the town of Adullam.
Genesis,38,2,"While there he met the daughter of Shua, a Canaanite man. Judah married her,"
Genesis,38,3,and they had three sons. He named the first one Er;
Genesis,38,4,she named the next one Onan.
Genesis,38,5,"The third one was born when Judah was in Chezib, and she named him Shelah."
Genesis,38,6,"Later, Judah chose Tamar as a wife for Er, his eldest son."
Genesis,38,7,"But Er was very evil, and the LORD took his life."
Genesis,38,8,"So Judah told Onan, “It's your duty to marry Tamar and have a child for your brother.”"
Genesis,38,9,"Onan knew the child would not be his, and when he had sex with Tamar, he made sure that she would not get pregnant."
Genesis,38,10,The LORD wasn't pleased with Onan and took his life too.
Genesis,38,11,"Judah did not want the same thing to happen to his son Shelah, and he told Tamar, “Go home to your father and live there as a widow until my son Shelah is grown up.” So Tamar went to live with her father."
Genesis,38,12,"Some years later Judah's wife died, and he mourned for her. He then went with his friend Hirah to the town of Timnah, where his sheep were being sheared."
Genesis,38,13,Tamar found out that her father-in-law Judah was going to Timnah to shear his sheep.
Genesis,38,14,"She also realized that Shelah was now a grown man, but she had not been allowed to marry him. So she decided to dress in something other than her widow's clothes and to cover her face with a veil. After this, she sat outside the town of Enaim on the road to Timnah."
Genesis,38,15,"When Judah came along, he did not recognize her because of the veil. He thought she was a prostitute"
Genesis,38,16,"and asked her to sleep with him. She asked, “What will you give me if I do?”"
Genesis,38,17,"“One of my young goats,” he answered. “What will you give me to keep until you send the goat?” she asked."
Genesis,38,18,"“What do you want?” he asked in return. “The ring on that cord around your neck,” was her reply. “I also want the special walking stick you have with you.” He gave them to her, they slept together, and she became pregnant."
Genesis,38,19,"After returning home, Tamar took off the veil and dressed in her widow's clothes again."
Genesis,38,20,"Judah sent his friend Hirah to take a goat to the woman, so he could get back the ring and walking stick, but she wasn't there."
Genesis,38,21,"Hirah asked the people of Enaim, “Where is the prostitute who sat along the road outside your town?” “There's never been one here,” they answered."
Genesis,38,22,"Hirah went back and told Judah, “I couldn't find the woman, and the people of Enaim said no prostitute had ever been there.”"
Genesis,38,23,"“If you couldn't find her, we'll just let her keep the things I gave her,” Judah answered. “And we'd better forget about the goat, or else we'll look like fools.”"
Genesis,38,24,"About three months later someone told Judah, “Your daughter-in-law Tamar has behaved like a prostitute, and now she's pregnant!” “Drag her out of town and burn her to death!” Judah shouted."
Genesis,38,25,"As Tamar was being dragged off, she sent someone to tell her father-in-law, “The man who gave me this ring, this cord, and this walking stick is the one who got me pregnant.”"
Genesis,38,26,"“Those are mine!” Judah admitted. “She's a better person than I am, because I broke my promise to let her marry my son Shelah.” After this, Judah never slept with her again."
Genesis,39,1,"The Ishmaelites took Joseph to Egypt and sold him to Potiphar, the king's official in charge of the palace guard."
Genesis,41,1,Two years later the king of Egypt dreamed he was standing beside the River Nile.
Genesis,41,2,"Suddenly, seven fat, healthy cows came up from the river and started eating grass along the bank."
Genesis,41,3,"Then seven ugly, skinny cows came up out of the river and"
Genesis,41,4,"ate the fat, healthy cows. When this happened, the king woke up."
Genesis,41,5,The king went back to sleep and had another dream. This time seven full heads of grain were growing on a single stalk.
Genesis,41,6,"Later, seven other heads of grain appeared, but they were thin and scorched by the east wind."
Genesis,41,7,"The thin heads of grain swallowed the seven full heads. Again the king woke up, and it had only been a dream."
Genesis,41,8,The next morning the king was upset. So he called in his magicians and wise men and told them what he had dreamed. None of them could tell him what the dreams meant.
Genesis,41,9,The king's personal servant said: Now I remember what I was supposed to do.
Genesis,41,10,"When you were angry with me and your chief cook, you threw us both in jail in the house of the captain of the guard."
Genesis,41,11,"One night we both had dreams, and each dream had a different meaning."
Genesis,41,12,"A young Hebrew, who was a servant of the captain of the guard, was there with us at the time. When we told him our dreams, he explained what each of them meant,"
Genesis,41,13,"and everything happened just as he said it would. I got my job back, and the cook was put to death."
Genesis,41,14,"The king sent for Joseph, who was quickly brought out of jail. He shaved, changed his clothes, and went to the king."
Genesis,41,15,"The king said to him, “I had a dream, yet no one can explain what it means. I am told that you can interpret dreams.”"
Genesis,41,16,"“Your Majesty,” Joseph answered, “I can't do it myself, but God can give a good meaning to your dreams.”"
Genesis,41,17,The king told Joseph: I dreamed I was standing on the bank of the River Nile.
Genesis,41,18,"I saw seven fat, healthy cows come up out of the river, and they began feeding on the grass."
Genesis,41,19,"Next, seven skinny, bony cows came up out of the river. I have never seen such terrible looking cows anywhere in Egypt."
Genesis,41,20,The skinny cows ate the fat ones.
Genesis,41,21,"But you couldn't tell it, because these skinny cows were just as skinny as they were before. Straight away, I woke up."
Genesis,41,22,I also dreamed that I saw seven heads of grain growing on one stalk. The heads were full and ripe.
Genesis,41,23,Then seven other heads of grain came up. They were thin and scorched by a wind from the desert.
Genesis,41,24,"These heads of grain swallowed the full ones. I told my dreams to the magicians, but none of them could tell me the meaning of the dreams."
Genesis,41,25,"Joseph replied: Your Majesty, both of your dreams mean the same thing, and in them God has shown what he is going to do."
Genesis,41,26,"The seven good cows stand for seven years, and so do the seven good heads of grain."
Genesis,41,27,"The seven skinny, ugly cows that came up later also stand for seven years, as do the seven bad heads of grain that were scorched by the east wind. The dreams mean there will be seven years when there won't be enough grain."
Genesis,41,28,It is just as I said—God has shown what he intends to do.
Genesis,41,29,"For seven years Egypt will have more than enough grain,"
Genesis,41,30,"but that will be followed by seven years when there won't be enough. The good years of plenty will be forgotten, and everywhere in Egypt people will be starving."
Genesis,41,31,The famine will be so bad that no one will remember that once there had been plenty.
Genesis,41,32,God has given you two dreams to let you know that he has definitely decided to do this and that he will do it soon.
Genesis,41,33,"Your Majesty, you should find someone who is wise and will know what to do, so that you can put him in charge of all Egypt."
Genesis,41,34,Then appoint some other officials to collect one-fifth of every crop harvested in Egypt during the seven years when there is plenty.
Genesis,41,35,Give them the power to collect the grain during those good years and to store it in your cities.
Genesis,41,36,It can be stored until it is needed during the seven years when there won't be enough grain in Egypt. This will keep the country from being destroyed because of the lack of food.
Genesis,41,37,The king and his officials liked this plan.
Genesis,41,38,"So the king said to them, “No one could possibly handle this better than Joseph, since the Spirit of God is with him.”"
Genesis,41,39,"The king told Joseph, “God is the one who has shown you these things. No one else is as wise as you are or knows as much as you do."
Genesis,41,40,"I'm putting you in charge of my palace, and everybody will have to obey you. No one will be over you except me."
Genesis,41,41,You are now governor of all Egypt!”
Genesis,41,42,Then the king took off his royal ring and put it on Joseph's finger. He gave him fine clothes to wear and placed a gold chain around his neck.
Genesis,41,43,"He also let him ride in the chariot next to his own, and people shouted, “Make way for Joseph!” So Joseph was governor of Egypt."
Genesis,41,44,"The king told Joseph, “Although I'm king, no one in Egypt is to do anything without your permission.”"
Genesis,41,45,"He gave Joseph the Egyptian name Zaphenath Paneah. And he let him marry Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, a priest in the city of Heliopolis. Joseph travelled all over Egypt."
Genesis,41,46,"Joseph was thirty when the king made him governor, and he went everywhere for the king."
Genesis,41,47,For seven years there were big harvests of grain.
Genesis,41,48,Joseph collected and stored up the extra grain in the cities of Egypt near the fields where it was harvested.
Genesis,41,49,"In fact, there was so much grain that they stopped keeping record, because it was like counting the grains of sand along the beach."
Genesis,41,50,Joseph and his wife had two sons before the famine began.
Genesis,41,51,"Their first son was named Manasseh, which means, “God has let me forget all my troubles and my family back home.”"
Genesis,41,52,"His second son was named Ephraim, which means “God has made me a success in the land where I suffered.”"
Genesis,41,53,"Egypt's seven years of plenty came to an end,"
Genesis,41,54,"and the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had said. There was not enough food in other countries, but all over Egypt there was plenty."
Genesis,41,55,"When the famine finally struck Egypt, the people asked the king for food, but he said, “Go to Joseph and do what he tells you to do.”"
Genesis,41,56,"The famine became bad everywhere in Egypt, so Joseph opened the storehouses and sold the grain to the Egyptians."
Genesis,41,57,"People from all over the world came to Egypt, because the famine was severe in their countries."
Genesis,42,1,"When Jacob found out there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, “Why are you just sitting here, staring at one another?"
Genesis,42,2,"I have heard there is grain in Egypt. Now go down and buy some, so we won't starve to death.”"
Genesis,42,3,Ten of Joseph's brothers went to Egypt to buy grain.
Genesis,42,4,But Jacob did not send Joseph's younger brother Benjamin with them; he was afraid that something might happen to him.
Genesis,42,5,So Jacob's sons joined others from Canaan who were going to Egypt because of the terrible famine.
Genesis,42,6,"Since Joseph was governor of Egypt and in charge of selling grain, his brothers came to him and bowed with their faces to the ground."
Genesis,43,1,"The famine in Canaan got worse,"
Genesis,43,2,"until finally, Jacob's family had eaten all the grain they had bought in Egypt. So Jacob said to his sons, “Go back and buy some more grain.”"
Genesis,45,1,"Since Joseph could no longer control his feelings in front of his servants, he sent them out of the room. When he was alone with his brothers, he told them, “I am Joseph.”"
Genesis,45,2,Then he cried so loudly that the Egyptians heard him and told about it in the king's palace.
Genesis,45,3,"Joseph asked his brothers if his father was still alive, but they were too frightened to answer."
Genesis,45,4,"Joseph told them to come closer to him, and when they did, he said: Yes, I am your brother Joseph, the one you sold into Egypt."
Genesis,45,5,Don't worry or blame yourselves for what you did. God is the one who sent me ahead of you to save lives.
Genesis,45,6,"There has already been a famine for two years, and for five more years no one will plough fields or harvest grain."
Genesis,45,7,But God sent me on ahead of you to keep your families alive and to save you in this wonderful way.
Genesis,45,8,"After all, you weren't really the ones who sent me here—it was God. He made me the highest official in the king's court and placed me over all Egypt."
Genesis,45,9,"Now hurry back and tell my father that his son Joseph says, “God has made me ruler of Egypt. Come here as quickly as you can."
Genesis,45,10,"You will live near me in the region of Goshen with your children and grandchildren, as well as with your sheep, goats, cattle, and everything else you own."
Genesis,45,11,"I will take care of you there during the next five years of famine. But if you don't come, you and your family and your animals will starve to death.”"
Genesis,45,12,"All of you, including my brother Benjamin, can tell by what I have said that I really am Joseph."
Genesis,45,13,Tell my father about my great power here in Egypt and about everything you have seen. Hurry and bring him here.
Genesis,45,14,Joseph and Benjamin hugged each other and started crying.
Genesis,45,15,"Joseph was still crying as he kissed each of his other brothers. After this, they started talking with Joseph."
Genesis,45,16,"When it was told in the palace that Joseph's brothers had come, the king and his officials were happy."
Genesis,45,17,So the king said to Joseph: Tell your brothers to load their donkeys and return to Canaan.
Genesis,45,18,"They must bring their father and their families here. I will give them the best land in Egypt, and they can eat and enjoy everything that grows on it."
Genesis,45,19,Also tell your brothers to take some wagons from Egypt for their wives and children to ride in. And they must be sure to bring their father.
Genesis,45,20,"They can leave their possessions behind, because they will be given the best of everything in Egypt."
Genesis,45,21,"Jacob's sons agreed to do what the king had said. And Joseph gave them wagons and food for their trip home, just as the king had ordered."
Genesis,45,22,"Joseph gave some new clothes to each of his brothers, but to Benjamin he gave five new outfits and three hundred pieces of silver."
Genesis,45,23,"To his father he sent ten donkeys loaded with the best things in Egypt, and ten other donkeys loaded with grain and bread and other food for the return trip."
Genesis,45,24,"Then he sent his brothers off and told them, “Don't argue on the way home!”"
Genesis,45,25,"Joseph's brothers left Egypt, and when they arrived in Canaan,"
Genesis,45,26,they told their father that Joseph was still alive and was the ruler of Egypt. But their father was so surprised that he could not believe them.
Genesis,45,27,"Then they told him everything Joseph had said. When he saw the wagons Joseph had sent, he felt much better"
Genesis,45,28,"and said, “Now I can believe you! My son Joseph must really be alive, and I will get to see him before I die.”"
Genesis,46,1,Jacob packed up everything he owned and left for Egypt. On the way he stopped near the town of Beersheba and offered sacrifices to the God his father Isaac had worshipped.
Genesis,46,2,"That night, God spoke to him and said, “Jacob! Jacob!” “Here I am,” Jacob answered."
Genesis,46,3,"God said, “I am God, the same God your father worshipped. Don't be afraid to go to Egypt. I will give you so many descendants that one day they will become a nation."
Genesis,46,4,"I will go with you to Egypt, and later I will bring your descendants back here. Your son Joseph will be at your side when you die.”"
Genesis,48,1,"Joseph was told that his father Jacob had become very sick. So Joseph went to see him and took along his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim."
Genesis,48,2,"When Joseph arrived, someone told Jacob, “Your son Joseph has come to see you.” Jacob sat up in bed, but it took almost all his strength."
Genesis,48,3,"Jacob told Joseph: God All-Powerful appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, where he gave me his blessing"
Genesis,48,4,"and promised, “I will give you a large family with many descendants that will grow into a nation. And I am giving you this land that will belong to you and your family for ever.”"
Genesis,48,5,"Then Jacob went on to say: Joseph, your two sons Ephraim and Manasseh were born in Egypt, but I accept them as my own, just as Reuben and Simeon are mine."
Genesis,48,6,"Any children you have later will be considered yours, but their inheritance will come from Ephraim and Manasseh."
Genesis,48,7,"Unfortunately, your mother Rachel died in Canaan after we had left northern Syria and before we reached Bethlehem. And I had to bury her along the way."
Genesis,50,1,"Joseph started crying, then leaned over to hug and kiss his father."
Genesis,50,2,"Joseph gave orders for Jacob's body to be embalmed,"
Genesis,50,3,and it took the usual forty days. The Egyptians mourned seventy days for Jacob.
Genesis,50,4,"When the time of mourning was over, Joseph said to the Egyptian leaders, “If you consider me your friend, please speak to the king for me."
Genesis,50,5,"Just before my father died, he made me promise to bury him in his burial cave in Canaan. If the king will give me permission to go, I will come back here.”"
Genesis,50,6,"The king answered, “Go to Canaan and keep your promise to your father.”"
