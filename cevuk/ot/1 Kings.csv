1 Kings,1,1,"King David was now an old man, and he always felt cold, even under a lot of blankets."
1 Kings,1,2,"His officials said, “Your Majesty, we will look for a young woman to take care of you. She can lie down beside you and keep you warm.”"
1 Kings,2,1,"Not long before David died, he told Solomon:"
1 Kings,2,2,"My son, I will soon die, as everyone must. But I want you to be strong and brave."
1 Kings,2,3,"Do what the LORD your God commands and follow his teachings. Obey everything written in the Law of Moses. Then you will be a success, no matter what you do or where you go."
1 Kings,2,4,"You and your descendants must always faithfully obey the LORD . If you do, he will keep the solemn promise he made to me that someone from our family will always be king of Israel."
1 Kings,2,5,"Solomon, don't forget what Joab did to me by killing Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether, the two commanders of Israel's army. He killed them as if they were his enemies in a war, but he did it when there was no war. He is guilty, and now it's up to you to punish him"
1 Kings,2,6,"in the way you think best. Whatever you do, don't let him die peacefully in his old age."
1 Kings,2,7,The sons of Barzillai from Gilead helped me when I was running from your brother Absalom. Be kind to them and let them eat at your table.
1 Kings,2,8,"Be sure to do something about Shimei son of Gera from Bahurim in the territory of Benjamin. He cursed and insulted me the day I went to Mahanaim. But later, when he came to meet me at the River Jordan, I promised that I wouldn't kill him."
1 Kings,2,9,"Now you must punish him. He's an old man, but you're wise enough to know that you must have him killed."
1 Kings,3,1,"Solomon signed a treaty with the king of Egypt and married his daughter. She lived in the older part of Jerusalem until the palace, the LORD 's temple, and the wall around Jerusalem were completed."
1 Kings,3,2,"At that time, there was no temple for worshipping the LORD , and everyone offered sacrifices at the local shrines."
1 Kings,3,3,"Solomon loved the LORD and followed his father David's instructions, but Solomon also offered sacrifices and burnt incense at the shrines."
1 Kings,3,4,"The most important shrine was in Gibeon, and Solomon had offered more than a thousand sacrifices on that altar."
1 Kings,3,5,"One night while Solomon was in Gibeon, the LORD God appeared to him in a dream and said, “Solomon, ask for anything you want, and I will give it to you.”"
1 Kings,3,6,"Solomon answered: My father David, your servant, was honest and did what you commanded. You were always loyal to him, and you gave him a son who is now king."
1 Kings,3,7,"LORD God, I'm your servant, and you've made me king in my father's place. But I'm very young and know so little about being a leader."
1 Kings,3,8,"And now I must rule your chosen people, even though there are too many of them to count."
1 Kings,3,9,"Please make me wise and teach me the difference between right and wrong. Then I will know how to rule your people. If you don't, there is no way I could rule this great nation of yours."
1 Kings,5,1,"King Hiram of Tyre had always been friends with Solomon's father David. When Hiram learnt that Solomon was king, he sent some of his officials to meet with Solomon."
1 Kings,5,2,Solomon sent a message back to Hiram:
1 Kings,5,3,"Remember how my father David wanted to build a temple where the LORD his God could be worshipped? But enemies kept attacking my father's kingdom, and he never had the chance."
1 Kings,5,4,"Now, thanks to the LORD God, there is peace in my kingdom and no trouble or threat of war anywhere."
1 Kings,5,5,"The LORD God promised my father that when his son became king, he would build a temple for worshipping the LORD . So I've decided to do that."
1 Kings,5,6,I'd like you to send your workers to cut down cedar trees in Lebanon for me. I will pay them whatever you say and will even make my workers help them. We both know that your workers are more experienced than anyone else at cutting timber.
1 Kings,5,7,"Hiram was so happy when he heard Solomon's request that he said, “I am grateful that the Lord gave David such a wise son to be king of that great nation!”"
1 Kings,5,8,Then he sent back his answer: I received your message and will give you all the cedar and pine logs you need.
1 Kings,5,9,"My workers will carry them down from Lebanon to the Mediterranean Sea. They will tie the logs together and float them along the coast to wherever you want them. Then they will untie the logs, and your workers can take them from there. To pay for the logs, you can provide the grain I need for my household."
1 Kings,5,10,Hiram gave Solomon all the cedar and pine logs he needed.
1 Kings,5,11,"In return, Solomon gave Hiram two thousand tonnes of wheat and four hundred thousand litres of pure olive oil each year."
1 Kings,5,12,The LORD kept his promise and made Solomon wise. Hiram and Solomon signed a treaty and never went to war against each other.
1 Kings,5,13,"Solomon ordered thirty thousand people from all over Israel to cut logs for the temple,"
1 Kings,5,14,and he put Adoniram in charge of these workers. Solomon divided them into three groups of ten thousand. Each group worked one month in Lebanon and had two months off at home.
1 Kings,5,15,"He also had eighty thousand workers to cut stone in the hill country of Israel, seventy thousand workers to carry the stones,"
1 Kings,5,16,and over three thousand assistants to keep track of the work and to supervise the workers.
1 Kings,5,17,He ordered the workers to cut and shape large blocks of good stone for the foundation of the temple.
1 Kings,5,18,"Solomon's and Hiram's men worked with men from the city of Gebal, and together they got the stones and logs ready for the temple."
1 Kings,6,1,"Solomon's workers started building the temple during Ziv, the second month of the year. It had been four years since Solomon became king of Israel, and four hundred and eighty years since the people of Israel left Egypt."
1 Kings,6,2,"The inside of the LORD 's temple was twenty-seven metres long, nine metres wide, and thirteen and a half metres high."
1 Kings,6,3,A four and a half metre porch went all the way across the front of the temple.
1 Kings,6,4,The windows were narrow on the outside but wide on the inside.
1 Kings,7,1,Solomon's palace took thirteen years to build.
1 Kings,9,1,"The LORD 's temple and Solomon's palace were now finished, and Solomon had built everything he wanted."
1 Kings,9,2,"Some time later the LORD appeared to him again in a dream, just as he had done at Gibeon."
1 Kings,9,3,"The LORD said: I heard your prayer and what you asked me to do. This temple you have built is where I will be worshipped for ever. It belongs to me, and I will never stop watching over it."
1 Kings,9,4,"You must obey me, as your father David did, and be honest and fair. Obey my laws and teachings,"
1 Kings,9,5,and I will keep my promise to David that someone from your family will always be king of Israel.
1 Kings,9,6,"But if you or any of your descendants disobey my commands or start worshipping foreign gods,"
1 Kings,9,7,I will no longer let my people Israel live in this land I gave them. I will desert this temple where I said I would be worshipped. Then people everywhere will think this nation is only a joke and will make fun of it.
1 Kings,9,8,"This temple will become a pile of rocks! Everyone who walks by will be shocked, and they will ask, “Why did the LORD do such a terrible thing to his people and to this temple?”"
1 Kings,9,9,"Then they will answer, “We know why the LORD did this. The people of Israel rejected the LORD their God, who rescued their ancestors from Egypt, and they started worshipping other gods.”"
1 Kings,9,10,It took twenty years for the LORD 's temple and Solomon's palace to be built.
1 Kings,9,11,"Later, Solomon gave King Hiram of Tyre twenty towns in the region of Galilee to repay him for the cedar, pine, and gold he had given Solomon."
1 Kings,9,12,"When Hiram went to see the towns, he did not like them."
1 Kings,9,13,"He said, “Solomon, my friend, are these the kind of towns you want to give me?” So Hiram called the region Cabul because he thought it was worthless."
1 Kings,9,14,He sent Solomon only five thousand kilogrammes of gold in return.
1 Kings,9,15,"After Solomon's workers had finished the temple and the palace, he ordered them to fill in the land on the east side of Jerusalem, to build a wall around the city, and to rebuild the towns of Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer."
1 Kings,9,16,"Earlier, the king of Egypt had captured the town of Gezer; he burnt it to the ground and killed the Canaanite people living there. Then he gave it to his daughter as a wedding present when she married Solomon."
1 Kings,9,17,"So Solomon had the town rebuilt. Solomon made his workers rebuild Lower Beth-Horon,"
1 Kings,9,18,"Baalath, and Tamar in the desert of Judah."
1 Kings,9,19,"They also built towns where he could keep his supplies and his chariots and horses. Solomon made them build whatever he wanted in Jerusalem, Lebanon, and anywhere in his kingdom."
1 Kings,10,1,"The Queen of Sheba heard how famous Solomon was, so she went to Jerusalem to test him with difficult questions."
1 Kings,10,2,"She took along several of her officials, and she loaded her camels with gifts of spices, jewels, and gold. When she arrived, she and Solomon talked about everything she could think of."
1 Kings,10,3,"He answered every question, no matter how difficult it was."
1 Kings,12,1,Rehoboam went to Shechem where everyone was waiting to crown him king.
1 Kings,12,2,"Jeroboam son of Nebat heard what was happening, and he stayed in Egypt, where he had gone to hide from Solomon."
1 Kings,12,3,"But the people from the northern tribes of Israel sent for him. Then together they went to Rehoboam and said,"
1 Kings,12,4,"“Your father Solomon forced us to work very hard. But if you make our work easier, we will serve you and do whatever you ask.”"
1 Kings,12,5,"“Give me three days to think about it,” Rehoboam replied, “then come back for my answer.” So the people left."
1 Kings,12,6,"Rehoboam went to some leaders who had been his father's senior officials, and he asked them, “What should I tell these people?”"
1 Kings,12,7,"They answered, “If you want them to serve and obey you, then you should do what they ask today. Tell them you will make their work easier.”"
1 Kings,12,8,But Rehoboam refused their advice and went to the younger men who had grown up with him and were now his officials.
1 Kings,12,9,"He asked, “What do you think I should say to these people who asked me to make their work easier?”"
1 Kings,12,10,"His younger advisers said: Here's what we think you should say to them: “Compared to me, my father was weak."
1 Kings,12,11,"He made you work hard, but I'll make you work even harder. He punished you with whips, but I'll use whips with pieces of sharp metal!”"
1 Kings,12,12,"Three days later, Jeroboam and the others came back."
1 Kings,12,13,Rehoboam ignored the advice of the older advisers.
1 Kings,12,14,"He spoke bluntly and told them exactly what his own advisers had suggested: “My father made you work hard, but I'll make you work even harder. He punished you with whips, but I'll use whips with pieces of sharp metal!”"
1 Kings,14,1,"About the same time, Abijah son of Jeroboam got sick."
1 Kings,15,1,"Abijam became king of Judah in Jeroboam's eighteenth year as king of Israel,"
1 Kings,15,2,and he ruled from Jerusalem for three years. His mother was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.
1 Kings,15,3,"Abijam did not truly obey the LORD his God as his ancestor David had done. Instead, he was sinful just like his father Rehoboam."
1 Kings,16,1,The LORD sent Jehu son of Hanani to say to Baasha:
1 Kings,16,2,"Nobody knew who you were until I, the LORD , chose you to be the leader of my people Israel. And now you're acting exactly like Jeroboam by causing the Israelites to sin. What you've done has made me so angry"
1 Kings,16,3,"that I will destroy you and your family, just as I did the family of Jeroboam."
1 Kings,16,4,"Dogs will eat the bodies of your relatives who die in town, and vultures will eat the bodies of those who die in the country."
1 Kings,17,1,"Elijah was a prophet from Tishbe in Gilead. One day he went to King Ahab and said, “I'm a servant of the living LORD , the God of Israel. And I swear in his name that it won't rain until I say so. There won't even be any dew on the ground.”"
1 Kings,17,2,"Later, the LORD said to Elijah,"
1 Kings,17,3,“Leave and go across the River Jordan so you can hide near Cherith Brook.
1 Kings,17,4,"You can drink water from the brook, and eat the food I've told the ravens to bring you.”"
1 Kings,17,5,Elijah obeyed the LORD and went to live near Cherith Brook.
1 Kings,17,6,"Ravens brought him bread and meat twice a day, and he drank water from the brook."
1 Kings,17,7,"But after a while, it dried up because there was no rain."
1 Kings,17,8,"The LORD told Elijah,"
1 Kings,17,9,“Go to the town of Zarephath in Sidon and live there. I've told a widow in that town to give you food.”
1 Kings,17,10,"When Elijah came near the town gate of Zarephath, he saw a widow gathering sticks for a fire. “Would you please bring me a cup of water?” he asked."
1 Kings,17,11,"As she left to get it, he asked, “Would you also please bring me a piece of bread?”"
1 Kings,17,12,"The widow answered, “In the name of the living LORD your God, I swear that I don't have any bread. All I have is a handful of flour and a little olive oil. I'm on my way home now with these few sticks to cook what I have for my son and me. After that, we will starve to death.”"
1 Kings,17,13,"Elijah said, “Everything will be fine. Do what you said. Go home and prepare something for yourself and your son. But first, please make a small piece of bread and bring it to me."
1 Kings,17,14,The LORD God of Israel has promised that your jar of flour won't run out and your bottle of oil won't dry up before he sends rain for the crops.”
1 Kings,17,15,The widow went home and did exactly what Elijah had told her. She and Elijah and her family had enough food for a long time.
1 Kings,17,16,"The LORD kept the promise that his prophet Elijah had made, and she did not run out of flour or oil."
1 Kings,17,17,"Several days later, the son of the woman who owned the house got sick, and he kept getting worse, until finally he died."
1 Kings,17,18,"The woman shouted at Elijah, “What have I done to you? I thought you were God's prophet. Did you come here to cause the death of my son as a reminder that I've sinned against God?”"
1 Kings,17,19,"“Bring me your son,” Elijah said. Then he took the boy from her arms and carried him upstairs to the room where he was staying. Elijah laid the boy on his bed"
1 Kings,17,20,"and prayed, “ LORD God, why did you do such a terrible thing to this woman? She's letting me stay here, and now you've let her son die.”"
1 Kings,17,21,"Elijah stretched himself out over the boy three times, while praying, “ LORD God, bring this boy back to life!”"
1 Kings,17,22,"The LORD answered Elijah's prayer, and the boy started breathing again."
1 Kings,17,23,"Elijah picked him up and carried him downstairs. He gave the boy to his mother and said, “Look, your son is alive.”"
1 Kings,17,24,“You are God's prophet!” the woman replied. “Now I know that you really do speak for the LORD .”
1 Kings,19,1,Ahab told his wife Jezebel what Elijah had done and that he had killed the prophets.
1 Kings,19,2,She sent a message to Elijah: “You killed my prophets. Now I'm going to kill you! I pray that the gods will punish me even more severely if I don't do it by this time tomorrow.”
1 Kings,19,3,"Elijah was afraid when he got her message, and he ran to the town of Beersheba in Judah. He left his servant there,"
1 Kings,19,4,"then walked another whole day into the desert. Finally, he came to a large bush and sat down in its shade. He begged the LORD , “I've had enough. Just let me die! I'm no better off than my ancestors.”"
1 Kings,19,5,"Then he lay down in the shade and fell asleep. Suddenly an angel woke him up and said, “Get up and eat.”"
1 Kings,19,6,"Elijah looked around, and by his head was a jar of water and some baked bread. He sat up, ate and drank, then lay down and went back to sleep."
1 Kings,19,7,"Soon the LORD 's angel woke him again and said, “Get up and eat, or else you'll get too tired to travel.”"
1 Kings,19,8,"So Elijah sat up and ate and drank. The food and water made him strong enough to walk forty more days. At last, he reached Mount Sinai, the mountain of God,"
1 Kings,19,9,"and he spent the night there in a cave. While Elijah was on Mount Sinai, the LORD asked, “Elijah, why are you here?”"
1 Kings,19,10,"He answered, “ LORD God All-Powerful, I've always done my best to obey you. But your people have broken their solemn promise to you. They have torn down your altars and killed all your prophets, except me. And now they are even trying to kill me!”"
1 Kings,19,11,"“Go out and stand on the mountain,” the LORD replied. “I want you to see me when I pass by.” All at once, a strong wind shook the mountain and shattered the rocks. But the LORD was not in the wind. Next, there was an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake."
1 Kings,19,12,"Then there was a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire. Finally, there was a gentle breeze,"
1 Kings,19,13,"and when Elijah heard it, he covered his face with his coat. He went out and stood at the entrance to the cave. The LORD asked, “Elijah, why are you here?”"
1 Kings,19,14,"Elijah answered, “ LORD God All-Powerful, I've always done my best to obey you. But your people have broken their solemn promise to you. They have torn down your altars and killed all your prophets, except me. And now they are even trying to kill me!”"
1 Kings,19,15,"The LORD said: Elijah, you can go back to the desert near Damascus. And when you get there, appoint Hazael to be king of Syria."
1 Kings,19,16,"Then appoint Jehu son of Nimshi to be king of Israel, and Elisha son of Shaphat to take your place as my prophet."
1 Kings,19,17,"Hazael will start killing the people who worship Baal. Jehu will kill those who escape from Hazael, and Elisha will kill those who escape from Jehu."
1 Kings,19,18,"But seven thousand Israelites have refused to worship Baal, and they will live."
1 Kings,19,19,"Elijah left and found Elisha ploughing a field with a pair of oxen. There were eleven other men in front of him, and each one was also ploughing with a pair of oxen. Elijah went over and put his own coat on Elisha."
1 Kings,19,20,"Elisha stopped ploughing and ran after him. “Let me kiss my parents goodbye, then I'll go with you,” he said. “You can go,” Elijah said. “But remember what I've done for you.”"
1 Kings,19,21,"Elisha left and took his oxen with him. He killed them and boiled them over a fire he had made with the wood from his plough. He gave the meat to the people who were with him, and they ate it. Then he left with Elijah and became his assistant."
1 Kings,20,1,"King Benhadad of Syria called his army together. He was joined by thirty-two other kings with their horses and chariots, and together they marched to Samaria and attacked."
1 Kings,20,2,"Benhadad sent a messenger to tell King Ahab of Israel,"
1 Kings,20,3,"“Ahab, give me your silver and gold, your wives, and your strongest sons!”"
1 Kings,20,4,"“Your Majesty,” Ahab replied, “everything I have is yours, including me.”"
1 Kings,20,5,"Later, Benhadad sent another messenger to say to Ahab, “I have already told you to give me your silver and gold, your wives, and your children."
1 Kings,20,6,"But tomorrow at this time, I will send my officials into your city to search your palace and the houses of your officials. They will take everything else that you own.”"
1 Kings,20,7,"Ahab called a meeting with the leaders of Israel and said, “Benhadad is causing real trouble. He told me to give him my wives and children, as well as my silver and gold. And I agreed.”"
1 Kings,20,8,“Don't listen to him!” they answered. “You don't have to do what he says.”
1 Kings,20,9,"So Ahab sent someone to tell Benhadad, “Your Majesty, I'll give you my silver and gold, and even my wives and children. But I won't let you have anything else.” When Benhadad got his answer,"
1 Kings,20,10,"he replied, “I'll completely destroy Samaria! There won't even be enough of it left for my soldiers to carry back in their hands. If I don't do it, I pray that the gods will punish me terribly.”"
1 Kings,20,11,"Ahab then answered, “Benhadad, don't boast before the fighting even begins. Wait and see if you live through it.”"
1 Kings,20,12,"Meanwhile, Benhadad and the other kings had been drinking in their tents. But when Ahab's reply came, he ordered his soldiers to prepare to attack Samaria, and they all got ready."
1 Kings,20,13,"At that very moment, a prophet ran up to Ahab and said, “You can see that Benhadad's army is very strong. But the LORD has promised to help you defeat them today. Then you will know that the LORD is in control.”"
1 Kings,20,14,"“Who will fight the battle?” Ahab asked. The prophet answered, “The young bodyguards who serve the district officials.” “But who will lead them into battle?” Ahab asked. “You will!” the prophet replied."
1 Kings,20,15,"So Ahab called together the two hundred and thirty-two young soldiers and the seven thousand troops in Israel's army, and he got them ready to fight the Syrians."
1 Kings,21,1,Naboth owned a vineyard in Jezreel near King Ahab's palace.
1 Kings,21,2,"One day, Ahab said, “Naboth, your vineyard is near my palace. Give it to me so I can turn it into a vegetable garden. I'll give you a better vineyard or pay whatever you want for yours.”"
1 Kings,21,3,"Naboth answered, “This vineyard has always been in my family. I won't let you have it.”"
1 Kings,21,4,"So Ahab went home, angry and depressed because of what Naboth had told him. He lay on his bed, just staring at the wall and refusing to eat a thing."
1 Kings,21,5,"Jezebel his wife came in and asked, “What's wrong? Why won't you eat?”"
1 Kings,21,6,"“I asked Naboth to sell me his vineyard or to let me give him a better one,” Ahab replied. “And he told me I couldn't have it.”"
1 Kings,21,7,"“Aren't you the king of Israel?” Jezebel asked. “Get out of bed and eat something! Don't worry, I'll get Naboth's vineyard for you.”"
1 Kings,22,1,For the next three years there was peace between Israel and Syria.
1 Kings,22,2,During the third year King Jehoshaphat of Judah went to visit King Ahab of Israel.
1 Kings,22,3,"Ahab asked his officials, “Why haven't we tried to get Ramoth in Gilead back from the Syrians? It belongs to us.”"
1 Kings,22,4,"Then he asked Jehoshaphat, “Would you go to Ramoth with me and attack the Syrians?” “Just tell me what to do,” Jehoshaphat answered. “My army and horses are at your command."
1 Kings,22,5,"But first, let's ask the LORD .”"
1 Kings,22,6,"Ahab sent for about four hundred prophets and asked, “Should I attack the Syrians at Ramoth?” “Yes!” the prophets answered. “The Lord will help you defeat them.”"
1 Kings,22,7,"But Jehoshaphat said, “Just to make sure, is there another of the LORD 's prophets we can ask?”"
1 Kings,22,8,"“We could ask Micaiah son of Imlah,” Ahab said. “But I hate Micaiah. He always has bad news for me.” “Don't say that!” Jehoshaphat replied."
1 Kings,22,9,Then Ahab sent someone to bring Micaiah as soon as possible.
1 Kings,22,10,"All this time, Ahab and Jehoshaphat were dressed in their royal robes and were seated on their thrones at the threshing place near the gate of Samaria. They were listening to the prophets tell them what the LORD had said."
1 Kings,22,11,"Zedekiah son of Chenaanah was one of the prophets. He had made some horns out of iron and shouted, “Ahab, the LORD says you will attack the Syrians like a bull with iron horns and wipe them out!”"
1 Kings,22,12,"All the prophets agreed that Ahab should attack the Syrians at Ramoth, and they promised that the LORD would help him defeat them."
1 Kings,22,13,"Meanwhile, the messenger who went to get Micaiah whispered, “Micaiah, all the prophets have good news for Ahab. Now go and say the same thing.”"
1 Kings,22,14,"“I'll say whatever the living LORD tells me to say,” Micaiah replied."
1 Kings,22,15,"Then Micaiah went to Ahab, and Ahab asked, “Micaiah, should I attack the Syrians at Ramoth?” “Yes!” Micaiah answered. “The LORD will help you defeat them.”"
1 Kings,22,16,"“Micaiah, I've told you over and over again to tell me the truth!” Ahab shouted. “What does the LORD really say?”"
1 Kings,22,17,"He answered, “In a vision I saw Israelite soldiers walking around in the hills like sheep without a shepherd to guide them. The LORD said, ‘This army has no leader. They should go home and not fight.’ ”"
1 Kings,22,18,"Ahab turned to Jehoshaphat and said, “I told you he would bring bad news!”"
1 Kings,22,19,Micaiah replied: Listen to this! I also saw the LORD seated on his throne with every creature in heaven gathered around him.
1 Kings,22,20,"The LORD asked, “Who can trick Ahab and make him go to Ramoth where he will be killed?” They talked about it for a while,"
1 Kings,22,21,"then finally a spirit came forward and said to the LORD , “I can trick Ahab.” “How?” the LORD asked."
1 Kings,22,22,“I'll make Ahab's prophets lie to him.” “Good!” the LORD replied. “Now go and do it.”
1 Kings,22,23,"This is exactly what has happened, Ahab. The LORD made all your prophets lie to you, and he knows you will soon be destroyed."
1 Kings,22,24,"Zedekiah walked up to Micaiah and slapped him on the face. Then he asked, “Do you really think the LORD would speak to you and not to me?”"
1 Kings,22,25,"Micaiah answered, “You'll find out on the day you have to hide in the back room of some house.”"
1 Kings,22,26,"Ahab shouted, “Arrest Micaiah! Take him to Prince Joash and Governor Amon of Samaria."
1 Kings,22,27,Tell them to put him in prison and to give him nothing but bread and water until I come back safely.”
1 Kings,22,28,"Micaiah said, “If you do come back, I was wrong about what the LORD wanted me to say.” Then he told the crowd, “Don't forget what I said!”"
1 Kings,22,29,Ahab and Jehoshaphat led their armies to Ramoth in Gilead.
1 Kings,22,30,"Before they went into battle, Ahab said, “Jehoshaphat, I'll disguise myself, but you wear your royal robe.” Then Ahab disguised himself and went into battle."
1 Kings,22,31,The king of Syria had ordered his thirty-two chariot commanders to attack only Ahab.
1 Kings,22,32,"So when they saw Jehoshaphat in his robe, they thought he was Ahab and started to attack him. But when Jehoshaphat shouted out to them,"
1 Kings,22,33,"they realized he wasn't Ahab, and they left him alone."
1 Kings,22,34,"However, during the fighting a soldier shot an arrow without even aiming, and it hit Ahab where two pieces of his armour joined. He shouted to his chariot driver, “I've been hit! Get me out of here!”"
1 Kings,22,35,"The fighting lasted all day, with Ahab propped up in his chariot so he could see the Syrian troops. He bled so much that the bottom of the chariot was covered with blood, and by evening he was dead."
1 Kings,22,36,"As the sun was going down, someone in Israel's army shouted to the others, “Retreat! Go back home!”"
1 Kings,22,37,Ahab's body was taken to Samaria and buried there.
1 Kings,22,38,"Some workers washed his chariot near a spring in Samaria, and prostitutes washed themselves in his blood. Dogs licked Ahab's blood off the ground, just as the LORD had warned."
1 Kings,22,39,"Everything else Ahab did while he was king, including the towns he strengthened and the palace he built and furnished with ivory, is written in The History of the Kings of Israel."
