Genesis,1,1,In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
Genesis,1,2,"The earth was barren, with no form of life; it was under a roaring ocean covered with darkness. But the Spirit of God was moving over the water."
Genesis,1,3,"God said, “I command light to shine!” And light started shining."
Genesis,1,4,God looked at the light and saw that it was good. He separated light from darkness
Genesis,1,5,and named the light “Day” and the darkness “Night”. Evening came and then morning—that was the first day.
Genesis,1,6,"God said, “I command a dome to separate the water above it from the water below it.”"
Genesis,1,7,And that's what happened. God made the dome
Genesis,1,8,and named it “Sky”. Evening came and then morning—that was the second day.
Genesis,1,9,"God said, “I command the water under the sky to come together in one place, so there will be dry ground.” And that's what happened."
Genesis,1,10,"God named the dry ground “Land”, and he named the water “Sea”. God looked at what he had done and saw that it was good."
Genesis,1,11,"God said, “I command the earth to produce all kinds of plants, including fruit trees and grain.” And that's what happened."
Genesis,1,12,"The earth produced all kinds of vegetation. God looked at what he had done, and it was good."
Genesis,1,13,Evening came and then morning—that was the third day.
Genesis,1,14,"God said, “I command lights to appear in the sky and to separate day from night and to show the time for seasons, special days, and years."
Genesis,1,15,I command them to shine on the earth.” And that's what happened.
Genesis,1,16,"God made two powerful lights, the brighter one to rule the day and the other to rule the night. He also made the stars."
Genesis,1,17,"Then God put these lights in the sky to shine on the earth,"
Genesis,1,18,"to rule day and night, and to separate light from darkness. God looked at what he had done, and it was good."
Genesis,1,19,Evening came and then morning—that was the fourth day.
Genesis,1,20,"God said, “I command the sea to be full of living creatures, and I command birds to fly above the earth.”"
Genesis,1,21,"So God made the giant sea monsters and all the living creatures that swim in the sea. He also made every kind of bird. God looked at what he had done, and it was good."
Genesis,1,22,Then he gave the living creatures his blessing—he told the sea creatures to live everywhere in the sea and the birds to live everywhere on earth.
Genesis,1,23,Evening came and then morning—that was the fifth day.
Genesis,1,24,"God said, “I command the earth to give life to all kinds of tame animals, wild animals, and reptiles.” And that's what happened."
Genesis,1,25,"God made every one of them. Then he looked at what he had done, and it was good."
Genesis,1,26,"God said, “Now we will make humans, and they will be like us. We will let them rule the fish, the birds, and all other living creatures.”"
Genesis,1,27,So God created humans to be like himself; he made men and women.
Genesis,1,28,"God gave them his blessing and said: Have a lot of children! Fill the earth with people and bring it under your control. Rule over the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, and every animal on the earth."
Genesis,1,29,I have provided all kinds of fruit and grain for you to eat.
Genesis,1,30,"And I have given the green plants as food for everything else that breathes. These will be food for animals, both wild and tame, and for birds."
Genesis,1,31,God looked at what he had done. All of it was very good! Evening came and then morning—that was the sixth day.
Genesis,2,1,So the heavens and the earth and everything else were created.
Genesis,2,2,"By the seventh day God had finished his work, and so he rested."
Genesis,2,3,God blessed the seventh day and made it special because on that day he rested from his work.
Genesis,2,4,"That's how God created the heavens and the earth. When the LORD God made the heavens and the earth,"
Genesis,2,5,"no grass or plants were growing anywhere. God had not yet sent any rain, and there was no one to work the land."
Genesis,2,6,But streams came up from the ground and watered the earth.
Genesis,2,7,"The LORD God took a handful of soil and made a man. God breathed life into the man, and the man started breathing."
Genesis,2,8,"The LORD made a garden in a place called Eden, which was in the east, and he put the man there."
Genesis,2,9,The LORD God placed all kinds of beautiful trees and fruit trees in the garden. Two other trees were in the middle of the garden. One of the trees gave life—the other gave the power to know the difference between right and wrong.
Genesis,2,10,"From Eden a river flowed out to water the garden, then it divided into four rivers."
Genesis,2,11,"The first one is the River Pishon that flows through the land of Havilah,"
Genesis,2,12,"where pure gold, rare perfumes, and precious stones are found."
Genesis,2,13,The second is the River Gihon that winds through Ethiopia.
Genesis,2,14,"The River Tigris that flows east of Assyria is the third, and the fourth is the River Euphrates."
Genesis,2,15,The LORD God put the man in the Garden of Eden to take care of it and to look after it.
Genesis,2,16,"But the LORD told him, “You may eat fruit from any tree in the garden,"
Genesis,2,17,"except the one that has the power to let you know the difference between right and wrong. If you eat any fruit from that tree, you will die before the day is over!”"
Genesis,2,18,"The LORD God said, “It isn't good for the man to live alone. I need to make a suitable partner for him.”"
Genesis,3,1,"The snake was more cunning than any of the other wild animals that the LORD God had made. One day it came to the woman and asked, “Did God tell you not to eat fruit from any tree in the garden?”"
Genesis,3,2,"The woman answered, “God said we could eat fruit from any tree in the garden,"
Genesis,3,3,"except the one in the middle. He told us not to eat fruit from that tree or even to touch it. If we do, we will die.”"
Genesis,3,4,"“No, you won't!” the snake replied."
Genesis,3,5,"“God understands what will happen on the day you eat fruit from that tree. You will see what you have done, and you will know the difference between right and wrong, just as God does.”"
Genesis,3,6,"The woman stared at the fruit. It looked beautiful and tasty. She wanted the wisdom that it would give her, and she ate some of the fruit. Her husband was there with her, so she gave some to him, and he ate it too."
Genesis,3,7,"Straight away they saw what they had done, and they realized they were naked. Then they sewed fig leaves together to make something to cover themselves."
Genesis,3,8,"Late in the afternoon a breeze began to blow, and the man and woman heard the LORD God walking in the garden. They were frightened and hid behind some trees."
Genesis,3,9,"The LORD called out to the man and asked, “Where are you?”"
Genesis,3,10,"The man answered, “I was naked, and when I heard you walking through the garden, I was frightened and hid!”"
Genesis,3,11,“How did you know you were naked?” God asked. “Did you eat any fruit from that tree in the middle of the garden?”
Genesis,3,12,"“It was the woman you put here with me,” the man said. “She gave me some of the fruit, and I ate it.”"
Genesis,3,13,"The LORD God then asked the woman, “What have you done?” “The snake tricked me,” she answered. “And I ate some of that fruit.”"
Genesis,3,14,"So the LORD God said to the snake: “Because of what you have done, you will be the only animal to suffer this curse— for as long as you live, you will crawl on your stomach and eat dust."
Genesis,3,15,"You and this woman will hate each other; your descendants and hers will always be enemies. One of hers will strike you on the head, and you will strike him on the heel.”"
Genesis,3,16,"Then the LORD said to the woman, “You will suffer terribly when you give birth. But you will still desire your husband, and he will rule over you.”"
Genesis,3,17,"The LORD said to the man, “You listened to your wife and ate fruit from that tree. And so, the ground will be under a curse because of what you did. As long as you live, you will have to struggle to grow enough food."
Genesis,3,18,"Your food will be plants, but the ground will produce thorns and thistles."
Genesis,3,19,"You will have to sweat to earn a living; you were made out of soil, and you will once again turn into soil.”"
Genesis,3,20,The man Adam named his wife Eve because she would become the mother of all who live.
Genesis,3,21,Then the LORD God made clothes out of animal skins for the man and his wife.
Genesis,3,22,"The LORD said, “These people now know the difference between right and wrong, just as we do. But they must not be allowed to eat fruit from the tree that lets them live for ever.”"
Genesis,3,23,"So the LORD God sent them out of the Garden of Eden, where they would have to work the ground from which the man had been made."
Genesis,3,24,"Then God put winged creatures at the entrance to the garden and a flaming, flashing sword to guard the way to the life-giving tree."
Genesis,4,1,"Adam and Eve had a son. Then Eve said, “I'll name him Cain because I got him with the help of the LORD .”"
Genesis,4,2,"Later she had another son and named him Abel. Abel became a sheep farmer, but Cain farmed the land."
Genesis,4,3,"One day, Cain gave part of his harvest to the LORD,"
Genesis,4,4,"and Abel also gave an offering to the LORD . He killed the firstborn lamb from one of his sheep and gave the LORD the best parts of it. The LORD was pleased with Abel and his offering,"
Genesis,4,5,but not with Cain and his offering. This made Cain so angry that he could not hide his feelings.
Genesis,4,6,The LORD said to Cain: What's wrong with you? Why do you have such an angry look on your face?
Genesis,4,7,"If you had done the right thing, you would be smiling. But you did the wrong thing, and now sin is waiting to attack you like a lion. Sin wants to destroy you, but don't let it!"
Genesis,4,8,"Cain said to his brother Abel, “Let's go for a walk.” And when they were out in a field, Cain killed him."
Genesis,4,9,"Afterwards the LORD asked Cain, “Where is Abel?” “How should I know?” he answered. “Am I supposed to look after my brother?”"
Genesis,4,10,"Then the LORD said: Why have you done this terrible thing? You killed your own brother, and his blood flowed on to the ground. Now his blood is calling out for me to punish you."
Genesis,4,11,"And so, I'll put you under a curse. Because you killed Abel and made his blood run out on the ground, you will never be able to farm the land again."
Genesis,4,12,"If you try to farm the land, it won't produce anything for you. From now on, you'll be without a home, and you'll spend the rest of your life wandering from place to place."
Genesis,4,13,“This punishment is too hard!” Cain said.
Genesis,4,14,"“You're making me leave my home and live far from you. I will have to wander about without a home, and anyone could kill me.”"
Genesis,4,15,“No!” the LORD answered. “Anyone who kills you will be punished seven times worse than I am punishing you.” So the LORD put a mark on Cain to warn everyone not to kill him.
Genesis,4,16,"But Cain had to go far from the LORD and live in the Land of Wandering, which is east of Eden."
Genesis,4,17,"Later, Cain and his wife had a son named Enoch. At the time Cain was building a town, and so he named it Enoch after his son."
Genesis,4,18,"Then Enoch had a son named Irad, who had a son named Mehujael, who had a son named Methushael, who had a son named Lamech."
Genesis,4,19,"Lamech married Adah, then Zillah."
Genesis,7,1,"The LORD told Noah: Take your whole family with you into the boat, because you are the only one on this earth who pleases me."
Genesis,7,2,Take seven pairs of every kind of animal that can be used for sacrifice and one pair of all others.
Genesis,7,3,Also take seven pairs of every kind of bird with you. Do this so there will always be animals and birds on the earth.
Genesis,7,4,"Seven days from now I will send rain that will last for forty days and nights, and I will destroy all other living creatures I have made."
Genesis,8,1,"God did not forget about Noah and the animals with him in the boat. So God made a wind blow, and the water started going down."
Genesis,8,2,"God stopped up the places where the water had been gushing out from under the earth. He also closed up the sky, and the rain stopped."
Genesis,8,3,For one hundred and fifty days the water slowly went down.
Genesis,8,4,"Then on the seventeenth day of the seventh month of the year, the boat came to rest somewhere in the Ararat mountains."
Genesis,8,5,"The water kept going down, and the mountain tops could be seen on the first day of the tenth month."
Genesis,9,1,"God said to Noah and his sons: I am giving you my blessing. Have a lot of children and grandchildren, so people will live everywhere on this earth."
Genesis,9,2,"All animals, birds, reptiles, and fish will be afraid of you. I have placed them under your control,"
Genesis,9,3,"and I have given them to you for food. From now on, you may eat them, as well as the green plants that you have always eaten."
Genesis,9,4,"But life is in the blood, and you must not eat any meat that still has blood in it."
Genesis,10,1,"After the flood Shem, Ham, and Japheth had many descendants."
Genesis,11,1,"At first everyone spoke the same language,"
Genesis,11,2,"but after some of them moved from the east and settled in Babylonia,"
Genesis,12,1,"The LORD said to Abram: Leave your country, your family, and your relatives and go to the land that I will show you."
Genesis,12,2,I will bless you and make your descendants into a great nation. You will become famous and be a blessing to others.
Genesis,12,3,"I will bless anyone who blesses you, but I will put a curse on anyone who puts a curse on you. Everyone on earth will be blessed because of you."
Genesis,13,1,Abram and Sarai took everything they owned and went to the Southern Desert. Lot went with them.
Genesis,13,2,"Abram was very rich. He owned many cattle, sheep, and goats, and had a lot of silver and gold."
Genesis,13,3,"Abram moved from place to place in the Southern Desert. And finally, he went north and set up his tents between Bethel and Ai,"
Genesis,13,4,where he had earlier camped and built an altar. There he worshipped the LORD.
Genesis,13,5,"Lot, who was travelling with him, also had sheep, goats, and cattle, as well as his own family and slaves."
Genesis,14,1,"About this time, King Amraphel of Babylonia, King Arioch of Ellasar, King Chedorlaomer of Elam, and King Tidal of Goiim"
Genesis,14,2,"attacked King Bera of Sodom, King Birsha of Gomorrah, King Shinab of Admah, King Shemeber of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, also known as the city of Zoar."
Genesis,15,1,"Later the LORD spoke to Abram in a vision, “Abram, don't be afraid! I will protect you and reward you greatly.”"
Genesis,15,2,"But Abram answered, “ LORD All-Powerful, you have given me everything I could ask for, except children. And when I die, Eliezer of Damascus will get all I own."
Genesis,15,3,"You have not given me any children, and this servant of mine will inherit everything.”"
Genesis,15,4,"The LORD replied, “No, he won't! You will have a son of your own, and everything you have will be his.”"
Genesis,15,5,"Then the LORD took Abram outside and said, “Look at the sky and see if you can count the stars. That's how many descendants you will have.”"
Genesis,15,6,"Abram believed the LORD , and the LORD was pleased with him."
Genesis,15,7,"The LORD said to Abram, “I brought you here from Ur in Chaldea, and I gave you this land.”"
Genesis,15,8,"Abram asked, “ LORD God, how can I know the land will be mine?”"
Genesis,15,9,"Then the LORD told him, “Bring me a three-year-old cow, a three-year-old female goat, a three-year-old ram, a dove, and a young pigeon.”"
Genesis,15,10,Abram obeyed the LORD . Then he cut the animals in half and laid the two halves of each animal opposite each other on the ground. But he did not cut the doves and pigeons in half.
Genesis,15,11,"And when birds came down to eat the animals, Abram chased them away."
Genesis,15,12,"As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and everything became dark and frightening."
Genesis,16,1,"Abram's wife Sarai had not been able to have any children. But she owned a young Egyptian slave woman named Hagar,"
Genesis,16,2,"and Sarai said to Abram, “The LORD has not given me any children. Sleep with my slave, and if she has a child, it will be mine.” Abram agreed,"
Genesis,16,3,and Sarai gave him Hagar to be his wife. This happened after Abram had lived in the land of Canaan for ten years.
Genesis,16,4,"Later, when Hagar knew she was going to have a baby, she became proud and was hateful to Sarai."
Genesis,16,5,"Then Sarai said to Abram, “It's all your fault! I gave you my slave woman, but she has been hateful to me ever since she found out she was pregnant. You have done me wrong, and you will have to answer to the LORD for this.”"
Genesis,16,6,"Abram said, “All right! She's your slave, and you can do whatever you want with her.” But Sarai began treating Hagar so harshly that she finally ran away."
Genesis,16,7,"Hagar stopped to rest at a spring in the desert on the road to Shur. While she was there, the angel of the LORD came to her"
Genesis,16,8,"and asked, “Hagar, where have you come from, and where are you going?” She answered, “I'm running away from Sarai, my owner.”"
Genesis,16,9,"The angel said, “Go back to Sarai and be her slave."
Genesis,17,1,"Abram was ninety-nine years old when the LORD appeared to him again and said, “I am God All-Powerful. If you obey me and always do right,"
Genesis,17,2,I will keep my solemn promise to you and give you more descendants than can be counted.”
Genesis,17,3,"Abram bowed with his face to the ground, and God said:"
Genesis,18,1,"One hot summer afternoon Abraham was sitting by the entrance to his tent near the sacred trees of Mamre, when the LORD appeared to him."
Genesis,18,2,"Abraham looked up and saw three men standing nearby. He quickly ran to meet them, bowed with his face to the ground,"
Genesis,18,3,"and said, “Please come to my home where I can serve you."
Genesis,18,4,"I'll have some water brought, so you can wash your feet, then you can rest under the tree."
Genesis,18,5,"Let me get you some food to give you strength before you leave. I would be honoured to serve you.” “Thank you very much,” they answered. “We accept your offer.”"
Genesis,18,6,"Abraham quickly went to his tent and said to Sarah, “Hurry! Get a large sack of flour and make some bread.”"
Genesis,18,7,"After saying this, he rushed off to his herd of cattle and picked out one of the best calves, which his servant quickly prepared."
Genesis,18,8,"He then served his guests some yoghurt and milk together with the meat. While they were eating, he stood near them under the trees,"
Genesis,18,9,"and they asked, “Where is your wife Sarah?” “She is there in the tent,” Abraham answered."
Genesis,18,10,"One of the guests was the LORD , and he said, “I'll come back about this time next year, and when I do, Sarah will already have a son.” Sarah was behind Abraham, listening at the entrance to the tent."
Genesis,18,11,"Abraham and Sarah were very old, and Sarah was well past the age for having children."
Genesis,18,12,"So she laughed and said to herself, “Now that I am worn out and my husband is old, will I really know such happiness?”"
Genesis,18,13,"The LORD asked Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh? Does she doubt that she can have a child in her old age?"
Genesis,18,14,"I am the LORD ! There is nothing too difficult for me. I'll come back next year at the time I promised, and Sarah will already have a son.”"
Genesis,18,15,"Sarah was so frightened that she lied and said, “I didn't laugh.” “Yes, you did!” he answered."
Genesis,18,16,"When the three men got ready to leave, they looked down towards Sodom, and Abraham walked part of the way with them."
Genesis,18,17,"The LORD said to himself, “I should tell Abraham what I am going to do,"
Genesis,18,18,since his family will become a great and powerful nation that will be a blessing to all other nations on earth.
Genesis,18,19,"I have chosen him to teach his family to obey me for ever and to do what is right and fair. Then I will give Abraham many descendants, just as I promised.”"
Genesis,18,20,"The LORD said, “Abraham, I have heard that the people of Sodom and Gomorrah are doing all kinds of evil things."
Genesis,18,21,"Now I am going down to see for myself if those people really are that bad. If they aren't, I want to know about it.”"
Genesis,18,22,"The men turned and started towards Sodom. But the LORD stayed with Abraham,"
Genesis,18,23,"who asked, “ LORD , when you destroy the evil people, are you also going to destroy those who are good?"
Genesis,18,24,Wouldn't you spare the city if there are only fifty good people in it?
Genesis,18,25,"You surely wouldn't let them be killed when you destroy the evil ones. You are the judge of all the earth, and you do what is right.”"
Genesis,18,26,"The LORD replied, “If I find fifty good people in Sodom, I will save the city to keep them from being killed.”"
Genesis,18,27,"Abraham answered, “I am nothing more than the dust of the earth. Please forgive me, LORD , for daring to speak to you like this."
Genesis,18,28,"But suppose there are only forty-five good people in Sodom. Would you still wipe out the whole city?” “If I find forty-five good people,” the LORD replied, “I won't destroy the city.”"
Genesis,18,29,"“Suppose there are just forty good people?” Abraham asked. “Even for them,” the LORD replied, “I won't destroy the city.”"
Genesis,18,30,"Abraham said, “Please don't be angry, LORD , if I ask you what you will do if there are only thirty good people in the city.” “If I find thirty,” the LORD replied, “I still won't destroy it.”"
Genesis,18,31,"Then Abraham said, “I don't have any right to ask you, LORD , but what would you do if you find only twenty?” “Because of them, I won't destroy the city,” was the LORD 's answer."
Genesis,18,32,"Finally, Abraham said, “Please don't get angry, LORD , if I speak just once more. Suppose you find only ten good people there.” “For the sake of ten good people,” the LORD told him, “I still won't destroy the city.”"
Genesis,18,33,"After speaking with Abraham, the LORD left, and Abraham went back home."
Genesis,19,1,"That evening the two angels arrived in Sodom, while Lot was sitting near the city gate. When Lot saw them, he got up, bowed down low,"
Genesis,19,2,"and said, “Gentlemen, I am your servant. Please come to my home. You can wash your feet, spend the night, and be on your way in the morning.” They told him, “No, we'll spend the night in the city square.”"
Genesis,19,3,"But Lot kept insisting, until they finally agreed and went home with him. He baked some bread, cooked a meal, and they ate."
Genesis,19,4,"Before Lot and his guests could go to bed, every man in Sodom, young and old, came and stood outside his house"
Genesis,19,5,"and started shouting, “Where are your visitors? Send them out, so we can have sex with them!”"
Genesis,19,6,Lot went outside and shut the door behind him.
Genesis,19,7,"Then he said, “Friends, please don't do such a terrible thing!"
Genesis,19,8,"I have two daughters who have never been married. I'll bring them out, and you can do what you want with them. But don't harm these men. They are guests in my home.”"
Genesis,19,9,"“Don't get in our way,” the crowd answered. “You're an outsider. What right do you have to order us around? We'll do worse things to you than we're going to do to them.” The crowd kept arguing with Lot. Finally, they rushed towards the door to break it down."
Genesis,19,10,But the two angels in the house reached out and pulled Lot safely inside.
Genesis,19,11,"Then they struck everyone in the crowd blind, and none of them could even find the door."
Genesis,20,1,"Abraham moved to the Southern Desert, where he settled between Kadesh and Shur. Later he went to Gerar, and while there"
Genesis,20,2,he told everyone that his wife Sarah was his sister. So King Abimelech of Gerar had Sarah brought to him.
Genesis,20,3,"But God came to Abimelech in a dream and said, “You have taken a married woman, and for this you will die!”"
Genesis,21,1,The LORD was good to Sarah and kept his promise.
Genesis,21,2,"Although Abraham was very old, Sarah had a son exactly at the time God had said."
Genesis,21,3,"Abraham named his son Isaac,"
Genesis,21,4,"and when the boy was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him, just as the LORD had commanded."
Genesis,21,5,"Abraham was a hundred years old when Isaac was born,"
Genesis,21,6,"and Sarah said, “God has made me laugh. Now everyone will laugh with me."
Genesis,21,7,"Who would have dared to tell Abraham that some day I would have a child? But in his old age, I have given him a son.”"
Genesis,21,8,"The time came when Sarah no longer had to nurse Isaac, and on that day Abraham gave a big feast."
Genesis,22,1,"Some years later God decided to test Abraham, so he spoke to him. Abraham answered, “Here I am, LORD .”"
Genesis,22,2,"The LORD said, “Go and get Isaac, your only son, the one you dearly love! Take him to the land of Moriah, and I will show you a mountain where you must sacrifice him to me on the fires of an altar.”"
Genesis,22,3,So Abraham got up early the next morning and chopped wood for the fire. He put a saddle on his donkey and left with Isaac and two servants for the place where God had told him to go.
Genesis,22,4,Three days later Abraham looked into the distance and saw the place.
Genesis,22,5,"He told his servants, “Stay here with the donkey, while my son and I go over there to worship. We will come back.”"
Genesis,22,6,"Abraham put the wood on Isaac's shoulder, but he carried the hot coals and the knife. As the two of them walked along,"
Genesis,24,1,"Abraham was now a very old man. The LORD had made him rich, and he was successful in everything he did."
Genesis,24,2,"One day, Abraham called in his most trusted servant and said to him, “Solemnly promise me"
Genesis,24,3,"in the name of the LORD , who rules heaven and earth, that you won't choose a wife for my son Isaac from the people here in the land of Canaan."
Genesis,24,4,"Instead, go back to the land where I was born and find a wife for him from among my relatives.”"
Genesis,24,5,"But the servant asked, “What if the young woman I choose refuses to leave home and come here with me? Should I send Isaac there to look for a wife?”"
Genesis,24,6,"“No!” Abraham answered. “Don't ever do that, no matter what."
Genesis,24,7,"The LORD who rules heaven brought me here from the land where I was born and promised that he would give this land to my descendants for ever. When you go back there, the LORD will send his angel ahead of you to help you find a wife for my son."
Genesis,24,8,"If the woman refuses to come along, you don't have to keep this promise. But don't ever take my son back there.”"
Genesis,24,9,So the servant gave Abraham his word that he would do everything he had been told to do.
Genesis,24,10,"Soon after that, the servant loaded ten of Abraham's camels with valuable gifts. Then he set out for the city in northern Syria, where Abraham's brother Nahor lived."
Genesis,24,11,"When he got there, he let the camels rest near the well outside the city. It was late afternoon, the time when the women came out for water."
Genesis,24,12,"The servant prayed: You, LORD , are the God my master Abraham worships. Please keep your promise to him and let me find a wife for Isaac today."
Genesis,24,13,"The young women of the city will soon come to this well for water,"
Genesis,24,14,"and I'll ask one of them for a drink. If she gives me a drink and then offers to get some water for my camels, I'll know she is the one you have chosen and that you have kept your promise to my master."
Genesis,25,1,"Abraham married Keturah,"
Genesis,25,2,"and they had six sons: Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah."
Genesis,25,3,"Later, Jokshan became the father of Sheba and Dedan, and when Dedan grew up, he had three sons: Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim."
Genesis,25,4,"Midian also had five sons: Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah."
Genesis,26,1,"Once during Abraham's lifetime, the fields had not produced enough grain, and now the same thing happened. So Isaac went to King Abimelech of the Philistines in the land of Gerar,"
Genesis,26,2,"because the LORD had appeared to Isaac and said: Isaac, stay away from Egypt! I will show you where I want you to go."
Genesis,26,3,"You will live there as a foreigner, but I will be with you and bless you. I will keep my promise to your father Abraham by giving this land to you and your descendants."
Genesis,26,4,"I will give you as many descendants as there are stars in the sky, and I will give your descendants all this land. They will be a blessing to every nation on earth,"
Genesis,26,5,because Abraham did everything I told him to do.
Genesis,26,6,Isaac moved to Gerar
Genesis,26,7,"with his beautiful wife Rebekah. He was afraid that someone might kill him to get her, and so he told everyone that Rebekah was his sister."
Genesis,26,8,"After Isaac had been there a long time, King Abimelech looked out of a window and saw Isaac hugging and kissing Rebekah."
Genesis,26,9,"Abimelech called him in and said, “Rebekah must be your wife! Why did you say she is your sister?” “Because I thought someone would kill me,” Isaac answered."
Genesis,26,10,"“Don't you know what you've done?” Abimelech exclaimed. “If someone had slept with her, you would have made our whole nation guilty!”"
Genesis,26,11,Then Abimelech warned his people that anyone who even touched Isaac or Rebekah would be put to death.
Genesis,26,12,"Isaac planted grain and had a good harvest that same year. The LORD blessed him,"
Genesis,26,13,and Isaac was so successful that he became very rich.
Genesis,26,14,"In fact, the Philistines were jealous of the large number of sheep, goats, and slaves that Isaac owned,"
Genesis,26,15,and they stopped up the wells that Abraham's servants had dug before his death.
Genesis,26,16,"Finally, Abimelech said, “Isaac, I want you to leave our country. You have become too powerful to stay here.”"
Genesis,26,17,"Isaac left and settled in Gerar Valley,"
Genesis,26,18,where he cleaned out those wells that the Philistines had stopped up. Isaac also gave each of the wells the same name that Abraham had given to them.
Genesis,26,19,"While his servants were digging in the valley, they found a spring-fed well."
Genesis,26,20,"But the shepherds of Gerar Valley quarrelled with Isaac's shepherds and claimed the water belonged to them. So the well was named “Quarrel”, because they had quarrelled with Isaac."
Genesis,26,21,"Isaac's servants dug another well, and the shepherds also quarrelled about it. So that well was named “Jealous”."
Genesis,26,22,"Finally, they dug one more well. There was no quarrelling this time, and the well was named “Lots of Room”, because the LORD had given them room and would make them very successful."
Genesis,26,23,"Isaac went on to Beersheba,"
Genesis,26,24,"where the LORD appeared to him that night and told him, “Don't be afraid! I am the God who was worshipped by your father Abraham, my servant. I will be with you and bless you, and because of Abraham I will give you many descendants.”"
Genesis,26,25,"Isaac built an altar there and worshipped the LORD . Then he set up camp, and his servants started digging a well."
Genesis,26,26,"Meanwhile, Abimelech had left Gerar and was taking his adviser Ahuzzath and his army commander Phicol to see Isaac."
Genesis,26,27,"When they arrived, Isaac asked, “Why are you here? Didn't you send me away because you hated me?”"
Genesis,26,28,"They answered, “We now know for certain that the LORD is with you, and we have decided there needs to be a peace treaty between you and us. So let's make a solemn agreement"
Genesis,26,29,"not to harm each other. Remember, we have never hurt you, and when we sent you away, we let you go in peace. The LORD has truly blessed you.”"
Genesis,26,30,"Isaac gave a big feast for them, and everyone ate and drank."
Genesis,26,31,"Early the next morning Isaac and the others made a solemn agreement, then he let them go in peace."
Genesis,26,32,"Later that same day Isaac's servants came and said, “We've struck water!”"
Genesis,26,33,"So Isaac named the well Shibah, and the town is still called Beersheba."
Genesis,26,34,"When Esau was forty, he married Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite."
Genesis,26,35,But these two women brought a lot of grief to his parents Isaac and Rebekah.
Genesis,27,1,"After Isaac had become old and almost blind, he called in his firstborn son Esau, who asked him, “Father, what can I do for you?”"
Genesis,27,2,"Isaac replied, “I am old and might die at any time."
Genesis,27,3,"So take your bow and arrows, then go out in the fields, and kill a wild animal."
Genesis,27,4,Cook some of that tasty food that I love so much and bring it to me. I want to eat it once more and give you my blessing before I die.”
Genesis,27,5,"Rebekah had been listening, and as soon as Esau left to go hunting,"
Genesis,27,6,"she said to Jacob, “I heard your father tell Esau"
Genesis,27,7,to kill a wild animal and cook some tasty food for your father before he dies. Your father said this because he wants to bless your brother with the LORD as his witness.
Genesis,27,8,"Now, my son, listen carefully to what I want you to do."
Genesis,27,9,Go and kill two of your best young goats and bring them to me. I'll cook the tasty food that your father loves so much.
Genesis,27,10,"Then you can take it to him, so he can eat it and give you his blessing before he dies.”"
Genesis,27,11,"“My brother Esau is a hairy man,” Jacob reminded her. “And I am not."
Genesis,27,12,"If my father touches me and realizes I am trying to trick him, he will put a curse on me instead of giving me a blessing.”"
Genesis,27,13,"Rebekah insisted, “Let his curse fall on me! Just do what I say and bring me the meat.”"
Genesis,27,14,"So Jacob brought the meat to his mother, and she cooked the tasty food that his father liked."
Genesis,27,15,Then she took Esau's best clothes and put them on Jacob.
Genesis,27,16,She also covered the smooth part of his hands and neck with goatskins
Genesis,27,17,and gave him some bread and the tasty food she had cooked.
Genesis,27,18,"Jacob went to his father and said, “Father, here I am.” “Which one of my sons are you?” his father asked."
Genesis,27,19,"Jacob replied, “I am Esau, your firstborn, and I have done what you told me. Please sit up and eat the meat I have brought. Then you can give me your blessing.”"
Genesis,27,20,"Isaac asked, “My son, how did you find an animal so quickly?” “The LORD your God was kind to me,” Jacob answered."
Genesis,27,21,"“My son,” Isaac said, “come closer, where I can touch you and find out if you really are Esau.”"
Genesis,27,22,"Jacob went closer. His father touched him and said, “You sound like Jacob, but your hands feel hairy like Esau's.”"
Genesis,27,23,"And so Isaac blessed Jacob, thinking he was Esau."
Genesis,27,24,"Isaac asked, “Are you really my son Esau?” “Yes, I am,” Jacob answered."
Genesis,27,25,"So Isaac told him, “Serve me the wild meat, and I can give you my blessing.” Jacob gave him some meat, and he ate it. He also gave him some wine, and he drank it."
Genesis,27,26,"Then Isaac said, “Son, come over here and kiss me.”"
Genesis,27,27,"While Jacob was kissing him, Isaac caught the smell of his clothes and said: “The smell of my son is like a field the LORD has blessed."
Genesis,27,28,"God will bless you, my son, with dew from heaven and with fertile fields, rich with grain and grapes."
Genesis,27,29,"Nations will be your servants and bow down to you. You will rule over your brothers, and they will kneel at your feet. Anyone who curses you will be cursed; anyone who blesses you will be blessed.”"
Genesis,27,30,"Straight after Isaac had given Jacob his blessing and Jacob had gone, Esau came back from hunting."
Genesis,27,31,"He cooked the tasty food, brought it to his father, and said, “Father, please sit up and eat the meat I have brought you, so you can give me your blessing.”"
Genesis,27,32,"“Who are you?” Isaac asked. “I am Esau, your firstborn son.”"
Genesis,27,33,"Isaac started trembling and said, “Then who brought me some wild meat just before you came in? I ate it and gave him a blessing that cannot be taken back.”"
Genesis,27,34,"Esau cried loudly and begged, “Father, give me a blessing too!”"
Genesis,27,35,"Isaac answered, “Your brother tricked me and stole your blessing.”"
Genesis,27,36,"Esau replied, “My brother deserves the name Jacob, because he has already cheated me twice. The first time he cheated me out of my rights as the firstborn son, and now he has cheated me out of my blessing.” Then Esau asked his father, “Don't you still have any blessing left for me?”"
Genesis,27,37,"“My son,” Isaac answered, “I have made Jacob the ruler over you and your brothers, and all of you will be his servants. I have also promised him all the grain and grapes that he needs. There's nothing left that I can do for you.”"
Genesis,27,38,"“Father,” Esau asked, “don't you have more than one blessing? You can surely give me a blessing too!” Then Esau started crying again."
Genesis,27,39,"So his father said: “Your home will be far from that fertile land, where dew comes down from the heavens."
Genesis,27,40,"You will live by the power of your sword and be your brother's slave. But when you decide to be free, you will break loose.”"
Genesis,27,41,"Esau hated his brother Jacob because he had stolen the blessing that was supposed to be his. So he said to himself, “Just as soon as my father dies, I'll kill Jacob.”"
Genesis,27,42,"When Rebekah found out what Esau planned to do, she sent for Jacob and told him, “Son, your brother Esau is just waiting for the time when he can kill you."
Genesis,27,43,Now listen carefully and do what I say. Go to the home of my brother Laban in Haran
Genesis,27,44,and stay with him for a while. When Esau stops being angry
Genesis,27,45,"and forgets what you have done to him, I'll send for you to come home. Why should I lose both of my sons on the same day?”"
Genesis,27,46,"Rebekah later told Isaac, “Those Hittite wives of Esau are making my life miserable! If Jacob marries a Hittite woman, I'd be better off dead.”"
Genesis,28,1,"Isaac called in Jacob, then gave him a blessing, and said: Don't marry any of those Canaanite women."
Genesis,28,2,"Go at once to your mother's father Bethuel in northern Syria and choose a wife from one of the daughters of Laban, your mother's brother."
Genesis,28,3,I pray that God All-Powerful will bless you with many descendants and let you become a great nation.
Genesis,28,4,"May he bless you with the land he gave Abraham, so that you will take over this land where we now live as foreigners."
Genesis,28,5,"Isaac then sent Jacob to stay with Rebekah's brother Laban, the son of Bethuel the Aramean."
Genesis,28,6,Esau found out that his father Isaac had blessed Jacob and had warned him not to marry any of the Canaanite women. He also learnt that Jacob had been sent to find a wife in northern Syria
Genesis,28,7,and that he had obeyed his father and mother.
Genesis,28,8,"Esau already had several wives, but he realized at last how much his father hated the Canaanite women."
Genesis,28,9,"So he married Ishmael's daughter Mahalath, who was the sister of Nebaioth and the granddaughter of Abraham."
Genesis,28,10,Jacob left the town of Beersheba and started out for Haran.
Genesis,28,11,"At sunset he stopped for the night and went to sleep, resting his head on a large rock."
Genesis,28,12,"In a dream he saw a ladder that reached from earth to heaven, and God's angels were going up and down on it."
Genesis,28,13,The LORD was standing beside the ladder and said: I am the LORD God who was worshipped by Abraham and Isaac. I will give to you and your family the land on which you are now sleeping.
Genesis,28,14,Your descendants will spread over the earth in all directions and will become as numerous as the specks of dust. Your family will be a blessing to all people.
Genesis,28,15,"Wherever you go, I will watch over you, then later I will bring you back to this land. I won't leave you—I will do all I have promised."
Genesis,28,16,"Jacob woke up suddenly and thought, “The LORD is in this place, and I didn't even know it.”"
Genesis,28,17,"Then Jacob became frightened and said, “This is a fearsome place! It must be the house of God and the ladder to heaven.”"
Genesis,28,18,"When Jacob got up early the next morning, he took the rock that he had used for a pillow and stood it up for a place of worship. Then he poured olive oil on the rock to dedicate it to God,"
Genesis,28,19,and he named the place Bethel. Before that it had been named Luz.
Genesis,28,20,"Jacob solemnly promised God, “If you go with me and watch over me as I travel, and if you give me food and clothes"
Genesis,28,21,"and bring me safely home again, you will be my God."
Genesis,28,22,"This rock will be your house, and I will give back to you a tenth of everything you give me.”"
Genesis,29,1,"As Jacob continued on his way to the east,"
Genesis,29,2,"he looked out in a field and saw a well where shepherds took their sheep for water. Three flocks of sheep were lying around the well, which was covered with a large rock."
Genesis,29,3,"Shepherds would roll the rock away when all their sheep had gathered there. Then after the sheep had been watered, the shepherds would roll the rock back over the mouth of the well."
Genesis,29,4,"Jacob asked the shepherds, “Where are you from?” “We're from Haran,” they answered."
Genesis,29,5,"Then he asked, “Do you know Nahor's grandson Laban?” “Yes we do,” they replied."
Genesis,29,6,"“How is he?” Jacob asked. “He's fine,” they answered. “And here comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep.”"
Genesis,29,7,"Jacob told them, “Look, the sun is still high up in the sky, and it's too early to bring in the rest of the flocks. Water your sheep and take them back to the pasture.”"
Genesis,29,8,"But they replied, “We can't do that until they all get here, and the rock has been rolled away from the well.”"
Genesis,29,9,"While Jacob was still talking with the men, his cousin Rachel came up with her father's sheep."
Genesis,29,10,"When Jacob saw her and his uncle's sheep, he rolled the rock away and watered the sheep."
Genesis,29,11,He then kissed Rachel and started crying because he was so happy.
Genesis,29,12,"He told her that he was the son of her aunt Rebekah, and she ran and told her father about him."
Genesis,29,13,"As soon as Laban heard the news, he ran out to meet Jacob. He hugged and kissed him and brought him to his home, where Jacob told him everything that had happened."
Genesis,29,14,"Laban said, “You are my nephew, and you are like one of my own family.” After Jacob had been there for a month,"
Genesis,29,15,"Laban said to him, “You shouldn't have to work without pay, just because you are a relative of mine. What do you want me to give you?”"
Genesis,30,1,"Rachel was very jealous of Leah for having children, and she said to Jacob, “I'll die if you don't give me some children!”"
Genesis,30,2,"But Jacob became upset with Rachel and answered, “Don't blame me! I'm not God.”"
Genesis,30,3,"“Here, take my servant Bilhah,” Rachel told him. “Have children by her, and I'll let them be born on my knees to show that they are mine.”"
Genesis,30,4,"Then Rachel let Jacob marry Bilhah,"
Genesis,30,5,and they had a son.
Genesis,30,6,"Rachel named him Dan, because she said, “God has answered my prayers. He has judged me and given me a son.”"
Genesis,30,7,"When Bilhah and Jacob had a second son,"
Genesis,30,8,"Rachel said, “I've struggled hard with my sister, and I've won!” So she named the boy Naphtali."
Genesis,30,9,"When Leah realized she could not have any more children, she let Jacob marry her servant Zilpah,"
Genesis,30,10,and they had a son.
Genesis,30,11,"“I'm really lucky,” Leah said, and she named the boy Gad."
Genesis,30,12,"When they had another son,"
Genesis,30,13,"Leah exclaimed, “I'm happy now, and all the women will say how happy I am.” So she named him Asher."
Genesis,30,14,"During the time of the wheat harvest, Reuben found some love flowers and took them to his mother Leah. Rachel asked Leah for some of them,"
Genesis,30,15,"but Leah said, “It's bad enough that you stole my husband! Now you want my son's love flowers too.” “All right,” Rachel answered. “Let me have the flowers, and you can sleep with Jacob tonight.”"
Genesis,30,16,"That evening when Jacob came in from the fields, Leah told him, “You're sleeping with me tonight. I hired you with my son's love flowers.” They slept together that night,"
Genesis,30,17,and God answered Leah's prayers by giving her a fifth son.
Genesis,30,18,"Leah shouted, “God has rewarded me for letting Jacob marry my servant,” and she named the boy Issachar."
Genesis,30,19,"When Leah had another son,"
Genesis,30,20,"she exclaimed, “God has given me a wonderful gift, and my husband will praise me for giving him six sons.” So she named the boy Zebulun."
Genesis,30,21,"Later, Leah had a daughter and named her Dinah."
Genesis,31,1,"Jacob heard that Laban's sons were complaining, “Jacob is now a rich man, and he got everything he owns from our father.”"
Genesis,31,2,Jacob also noticed that Laban was not as friendly as he had been before.
Genesis,31,3,"One day the LORD said, “Jacob, go back to your relatives in the land of your ancestors, and I will bless you.”"
Genesis,31,4,"Jacob sent for Rachel and Leah to meet him in the field where he kept his sheep,"
Genesis,31,5,"and he told them: Your father isn't as friendly with me as he used to be, but the God my ancestors worshipped has been on my side."
Genesis,31,6,You know that I have worked hard for your father
Genesis,31,7,and that he keeps cheating me by changing my wages time after time. But God has protected me.
Genesis,31,8,"When your father said the speckled sheep would be my wages, all of them were speckled. And when he said the spotted ones would be mine, all of them were spotted."
Genesis,31,9,That's how God has taken sheep and goats from your father and given them to me.
Genesis,31,10,"Once, when the flocks were mating, I dreamed that all the rams were either spotted or speckled."
Genesis,31,11,"Then God's angel called me by name. I answered,"
Genesis,31,12,"and he said, “Notice that all the rams are either spotted or speckled. I know everything Laban is doing to you,"
Genesis,31,13,"and I am the God you worshipped at Bethel, when you poured olive oil on a rock and made a promise to me. Leave here straight away and return to the land where you were born.”"
Genesis,31,14,Rachel and Leah said to Jacob: There's nothing left for us to inherit from our father.
Genesis,31,15,He treats us like foreigners and has even cheated us out of the bride price that should have been ours.
Genesis,31,16,Now do whatever God tells you to do. Even the property God took from our father and gave to you really belongs to us and our children.
Genesis,31,17,"Then Jacob, his wives, and his children got on camels and left"
Genesis,31,18,"for the home of his father Isaac in Canaan. Jacob took all the flocks, herds, and other property that he had got in northern Syria."
Genesis,31,19,"Before Rachel left, she stole the household idols while Laban was out shearing his sheep."
Genesis,31,20,Jacob tricked Laban the Aramean by not saying that he intended to leave.
Genesis,31,21,"When Jacob crossed the River Euphrates and headed for the hill country of Gilead, he took with him everything he owned."
Genesis,31,22,Three days later Laban found out that Jacob had gone.
Genesis,31,23,"So he took some of his relatives along and chased after Jacob for seven days, before catching up with him in the hill country of Gilead."
Genesis,31,24,"But God appeared to Laban in a dream that night and warned, “Don't say a word to Jacob. Don't make a threat or a promise.”"
Genesis,31,25,"Jacob had set up camp in the hill country of Gilead, when Laban and his relatives came and set up camp in another part of the hill country. Laban went to Jacob"
Genesis,31,26,and said: Look what you've done! You've tricked me and run off with my daughters like a kidnapper.
Genesis,31,27,Why did you sneak away without telling me? I would have given you a going-away party with singing and with music on tambourines and harps.
Genesis,31,28,You didn't even give me a chance to kiss my own grandchildren and daughters goodbye. That was really foolish.
Genesis,31,29,"I could easily hurt you, but the God your father worshipped has warned me not to make any threats or promises."
Genesis,31,30,"I can understand why you were eager to return to your father, but why did you have to steal my idols?"
Genesis,31,31,"Jacob answered, “I left secretly because I was afraid you would take your daughters from me by force."
Genesis,31,32,"If you find that any one of us has taken your idols, I'll have that person killed. Let your relatives be witnesses. Show me what belongs to you, and you can take it back.” Jacob did not realize that Rachel had stolen the household idols."
Genesis,31,33,"Laban searched the tents of Jacob, Leah, and the two servant women, but did not find the idols. Then he started for Rachel's tent."
Genesis,31,34,She had already hidden them in the cushion she used as a saddle and was sitting on it. Laban searched everywhere and did not find them.
Genesis,31,35,"Rachel said, “Father, please don't be angry with me for not getting up; I am having my period.” Laban kept on searching, but still did not find the idols."
Genesis,31,36,Jacob became very angry and said to Laban: What have I done wrong? Have I committed some crime? Is that why you hunted me down?
Genesis,31,37,"After searching through everything I have, did you find anything of yours? If so, put it here, where your relatives and mine can see it. Then we can decide what to do."
Genesis,31,38,"In all the twenty years that I've worked for you, not one of your sheep or goats has had a miscarriage, and I've never eaten even one of your rams."
Genesis,31,39,"If a wild animal killed one of your sheep or goats, I paid for it myself. In fact, you demanded the full price, whether the animal was killed during the day or at night."
Genesis,31,40,"I sweated every day, and I couldn't sleep at night because of the cold."
Genesis,31,41,I had to work fourteen of these twenty long years to earn your two daughters and another six years to buy your sheep and goats. During that time you kept changing my wages.
Genesis,31,42,"If the fearsome God worshipped by Abraham and my father Isaac had not been on my side, you would have sent me away without a thing. But God saw my hard work, and he knew the trouble I was in, so he helped me. Then last night he told you how wrong you were."
Genesis,31,43,"Laban said to Jacob, “Leah and Rachel are my daughters, and their children belong to me. All these sheep you are taking are really mine too. In fact, everything you have belongs to me. But there is nothing I can do to keep my daughters and their children."
Genesis,31,44,"So I am ready to make an agreement with you, and we will pile up some large rocks here to remind us of the agreement.”"
Genesis,31,45,"After Jacob had set up a large rock,"
Genesis,31,46,he told his men to get some more rocks and pile them up next to it. Then Jacob and Laban ate a meal together beside the rocks.
Genesis,31,47,Laban named the pile of rocks Jegar Sahadutha. But Jacob named it Galeed.
Genesis,31,48,"Laban said to Jacob, “This pile of rocks will remind us of our agreement.” That's why the place was named Galeed."
Genesis,31,49,"Laban also said, “This pile of rocks means that the LORD will watch us both while we are apart from each other.” So the place was also named Mizpah."
Genesis,31,50,"Then Laban said: If you ill-treat my daughters or marry other women, I may not know about it, but remember, God is watching us!"
Genesis,32,1,"As Jacob was on his way back home, some of God's angels came and met him."
Genesis,32,2,"When Jacob saw them, he said, “This is God's camp.” So he named the place Mahanaim."
Genesis,32,3,"Jacob sent messengers on ahead to Esau, who lived in the land of Seir, also known as Edom."
Genesis,32,4,"Jacob told them to say to Esau, “Master, I am your servant! I have lived with Laban all this time,"
Genesis,32,5,"and now I own cattle, donkeys, and sheep, as well as many slaves. Master, I am sending these messengers in the hope that you will be kind to me.”"
Genesis,32,6,"When the messengers returned, they told Jacob, “We went to your brother Esau, and now he is heading this way with four hundred men.”"
Genesis,32,7,"Jacob was so frightened that he divided his people, sheep, cattle, and camels into two groups."
Genesis,32,8,"He thought, “If Esau attacks one group, perhaps the other can escape.”"
Genesis,32,9,"Then Jacob prayed: You, LORD , are the God who was worshipped by my grandfather Abraham and by my father Isaac. You told me to return home to my family, and you promised to be with me and make me successful."
Genesis,32,10,"I don't deserve all the good things you have done for me, your servant. When I first crossed the Jordan, I had only my walking stick, but now I have two large groups of people and animals."
Genesis,32,11,"Please rescue me from my brother. I am afraid he will come and attack not only me, but my wives and children as well."
Genesis,32,12,But you have promised that I would be a success and that some day it will be as hard to count my descendants as it is to count the stars in the sky.
Genesis,32,13,"After Jacob had spent the night there, he chose some animals as gifts for Esau:"
Genesis,33,1,Later that day Jacob met Esau coming with his four hundred men. So Jacob made his children walk with their mothers.
Genesis,33,2,"The two servant women, Zilpah and Bilhah, together with their children went first, followed by Leah and her children, then by Rachel and Joseph."
Genesis,33,3,"Jacob himself walked in front of them all, bowing to the ground seven times as he came near his brother."
Genesis,33,4,But Esau ran towards Jacob and hugged and kissed him. Then the two brothers started crying.
Genesis,33,5,"When Esau noticed the women and children he asked, “Whose children are these?” Jacob answered, “These are the ones the LORD has been kind enough to give to me, your servant.”"
Genesis,33,6,Then the two servant women and their children came and bowed down to Esau.
Genesis,33,7,"Next, Leah and her children came and bowed down; finally, Joseph and Rachel also came and bowed down."
Genesis,33,8,"Esau asked Jacob, “What did you mean by these herds I met along the road?” “Master,” Jacob answered, “I sent them so that you would be friendly to me.”"
Genesis,33,9,"“But, brother, I already have plenty,” Esau replied. “Keep them for yourself.”"
Genesis,33,10,"“No!” Jacob said. “Please accept these gifts as a sign of your friendship for me. When you welcomed me and I saw your face, it was like seeing the face of God."
Genesis,33,11,"Please accept these gifts I brought to you. God has been good to me, and I have everything I need.” Jacob kept insisting until Esau accepted the gifts."
Genesis,33,12,"“Let's get ready to travel,” Esau said. “I'll go along with you.”"
Genesis,33,13,"But Jacob answered, “Master, you know travelling is hard on children, and I have to look after the sheep and goats that are nursing their young. If my animals travel too much in one day, they will all die."
Genesis,33,14,"Why don't you go on ahead and let me travel along slowly with the children, the herds, and the flocks. We can meet again in the country of Edom.”"
Genesis,33,15,"Esau replied, “Let me leave some of my men with you.” “You don't have to do that,” Jacob answered. “I am happy, simply knowing that you are friendly to me.”"
Genesis,33,16,So Esau left for Edom.
Genesis,33,17,"But Jacob went to Succoth, where he built a house for himself and set up shelters for his animals. That's why the place is called Succoth."
Genesis,33,18,"After leaving northern Syria, Jacob arrived safely at Shechem in Canaan and set up camp outside the city."
Genesis,33,19,"The land where he camped was owned by the descendants of Hamor, the father of Shechem. So Jacob paid them one hundred pieces of silver for the property,"
Genesis,33,20,then he set up his tents and built an altar there to honour the God of Israel.
Genesis,34,1,"Dinah, the daughter of Jacob and Leah, went to visit some of the women who lived there."
Genesis,34,2,"She was seen by Hamor's son Shechem, the leader of the Hivites, and he grabbed her and raped her."
Genesis,34,3,"But Shechem was attracted to Dinah, so he told her how much he loved her."
Genesis,34,4,He even asked his father to get her for his wife.
Genesis,34,5,"Meanwhile, Jacob heard what had happened. But his sons were out in the fields with the cattle, so he did not do anything at the time."
Genesis,34,6,Hamor arrived at Jacob's home
Genesis,34,7,"just as Jacob's sons were coming in from work. When they learnt that their sister had been raped, they became furiously angry. Nothing is more disgraceful than rape, and it should not be tolerated in Israel."
Genesis,34,8,Hamor said to Jacob and his sons: My son Shechem really loves Dinah. Please let him marry her.
Genesis,34,9,Why don't you start letting your families marry into our families and ours marry into yours?
Genesis,34,10,You can share this land with us. Move freely about until you find the property you want; then buy it and settle down here.
Genesis,34,11,"Shechem added, “Do this favour for me, and I'll give whatever you want."
Genesis,34,12,"Ask anything, no matter how expensive. I'll do anything, just let me marry Dinah.”"
Genesis,34,13,Jacob's sons wanted to get even with Shechem and his father because of what had happened to their sister.
Genesis,34,14,So they tricked them by saying: You're not circumcised! It would be a disgrace for us to let you marry Dinah now.
Genesis,34,15,"But we will let you marry her, if you and the other men in your tribe get circumcised."
Genesis,34,16,"Then your families can marry into ours, and ours can marry into yours, and we can live together like one nation."
Genesis,34,17,"But if you don't agree to get circumcised, we'll take Dinah and leave this place."
Genesis,34,18,Hamor and Shechem liked what was said.
Genesis,34,19,"Shechem was the most respected person in his family, and he was so in love with Dinah that he hurried off to get everything done."
Genesis,34,20,The two men met with the other leaders of their city and told them:
Genesis,34,21,"These people really are friendly. Why not let them move freely about until they find the property they want? There's enough land here for them and for us. Then our families can marry into theirs, and theirs can marry into ours."
Genesis,34,22,We have to do only one thing before they will agree to stay here and become one nation with us. Our men will have to be circumcised like their men.
Genesis,34,23,"Just think! We'll get their property, as well as their flocks and herds. All we have to do is to agree, and they will live here with us."
Genesis,34,24,Every grown man followed this advice and got circumcised.
Genesis,34,25,"Three days later the men who had been circumcised were still weak from pain. So Simeon and Levi, two of Dinah's brothers, attacked with their swords and killed every man in town,"
Genesis,34,26,including Hamor and Shechem. Then they took Dinah and left.
Genesis,34,27,Jacob's other sons came and took everything they wanted. All this was done because of the horrible thing that had happened to their sister.
Genesis,34,28,"They took sheep, goats, donkeys, and everything else that was in the town or the fields."
Genesis,34,29,"After taking everything of value from the houses, they dragged away the wives and children of their victims."
Genesis,34,30,"Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “Look what you've done! Now I'm in real trouble with the Canaanites and Perizzites who live around here. There aren't many of us, and if they attack, they'll kill everyone in my household.”"
Genesis,34,31,"They answered, “Was it right to let our own sister be treated that way?”"
Genesis,35,1,"God told Jacob, “Return to Bethel, where I appeared to you when you were running from your brother Esau. Make your home there and build an altar for me.”"
Genesis,35,2,Jacob said to his family and to everyone else who was travelling with him: Get rid of your foreign gods! Then make yourselves acceptable to worship God and put on clean clothes.
Genesis,35,3,"Afterwards, we'll go to Bethel. I will build an altar there for God, who answered my prayers when I was in trouble and who has always been at my side."
Genesis,35,4,"So everyone gave Jacob their idols and their earrings, and he buried them under the oak tree near Shechem."
Genesis,35,5,"While Jacob and his family were travelling through Canaan, God terrified the people in the towns so much that no one dared bother them."
Genesis,35,6,"Finally, they reached Bethel, also known as Luz."
Genesis,35,7,"Jacob built an altar there and called it “God of Bethel”, because that was the place where God had appeared to him when he was running from Esau."
Genesis,35,8,"While they were there, Rebekah's personal servant Deborah died. They buried her under an oak tree and called it “Weeping Oak”."
Genesis,36,1,"Esau, also known as Edom, had many descendants."
Genesis,36,2,"He married three Canaanite women: the first was Adah, the daughter of Elon the Hittite; the second was Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah and the granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite;"
Genesis,36,3,"the third was Basemath, who was Ishmael's daughter and Nebaioth's sister."
Genesis,37,1,"Jacob lived in the land of Canaan, where his father Isaac had lived,"
Genesis,37,2,"and this is the story of his family. When Jacob's son Joseph was seventeen years old, he took care of the sheep with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah. But he was always telling his father all sorts of bad things about his brothers."
Genesis,37,3,"Jacob loved Joseph more than he did any of his other sons, because Joseph was born after Jacob was very old. Jacob had given Joseph a fine coat"
Genesis,37,4,"to show that he was his favourite son, and so Joseph's brothers hated him and would not be friendly to him."
Genesis,37,5,"One day, Joseph told his brothers what he had dreamed, and they hated him even more."
Genesis,37,6,"Joseph said, “Let me tell you about my dream."
Genesis,37,7,"We were out in the field, tying up bundles of wheat. Suddenly my bundle stood up, and your bundles gathered around and bowed down to it.”"
Genesis,37,8,"His brothers asked, “Do you really think you are going to be king and rule over us?” Now they hated Joseph more than ever because of what he had said about his dream."
Genesis,37,9,"Joseph later had another dream, and he told his brothers, “Listen to what else I dreamed. The sun, the moon, and eleven stars bowed down to me.”"
Genesis,37,10,"When he told his father about this dream, his father became angry and said, “What's that supposed to mean? Are your mother and I and your brothers all going to come and bow down in front of you?”"
Genesis,37,11,"Joseph's brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept wondering about the dream."
Genesis,37,12,"One day when Joseph's brothers had taken the sheep to a pasture near Shechem,"
Genesis,37,13,"his father Jacob said to him, “I want you to go to your brothers. They are with the sheep near Shechem.” “Yes, sir,” Joseph answered."
Genesis,37,14,"His father said, “Go and find out how your brothers and the sheep are doing. Then come back and let me know.” So he sent him from Hebron Valley. Joseph was near Shechem"
Genesis,37,15,"and wandering through the fields, when a man asked, “What are you looking for?”"
Genesis,37,16,"Joseph answered, “I'm looking for my brothers who are watching the sheep. Can you tell me where they are?”"
Genesis,37,17,"“They're not here any more,” the man replied. “I overheard them say they were going to Dothan.” Joseph left and found his brothers in Dothan."
Genesis,37,18,"But before he got there, they saw him coming and made plans to kill him."
Genesis,37,19,"They said to one another, “Look, here comes the hero of those dreams!"
Genesis,37,20,Let's kill him and throw him into a pit and say that some wild animal ate him. Then we'll see what happens to those dreams.”
Genesis,37,21,"Reuben heard this and tried to protect Joseph from them. “Let's not kill him,” he said."
Genesis,37,22,“Don't murder him or even harm him. Just throw him into a dry well out here in the desert.” Reuben planned to rescue Joseph later and take him back to his father.
Genesis,37,23,"When Joseph came to his brothers, they pulled off his fine coat"
Genesis,37,24,and threw him into a dry well.
Genesis,37,25,"As Joseph's brothers sat down to eat, they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were loaded with all kinds of spices that they were taking to Egypt."
Genesis,37,26,"So Judah said, “What will we gain if we kill our brother and hide his body?"
Genesis,37,27,"Let's sell him to the Ishmaelites and not harm him. After all, he is our brother.” And the others agreed."
Genesis,37,28,"When the Midianite merchants came by, Joseph's brothers took him out of the well, and for twenty pieces of silver they sold him to the Ishmaelites who took him to Egypt."
Genesis,37,29,"When Reuben returned to the well and did not find Joseph there, he tore his clothes in sorrow."
Genesis,37,30,"Then he went back to his brothers and said, “The boy is gone! What am I going to do?”"
Genesis,37,31,Joseph's brothers killed a goat and dipped Joseph's fine coat in its blood.
Genesis,37,32,"After this, they took the coat to their father and said, “We found this! Look at it carefully and see if it belongs to your son.”"
Genesis,37,33,"Jacob knew it was Joseph's coat and said, “It's my son's coat! Joseph has been torn to pieces and eaten by some wild animal.”"
Genesis,37,34,"Jacob mourned for Joseph a long time, and to show his sorrow he tore his clothes and wore sackcloth."
Genesis,37,35,"All Jacob's children came to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. “No,” he said, “I will go to my grave, mourning for my son.” So Jacob kept on grieving."
Genesis,37,36,"Meanwhile, the Midianites had sold Joseph in Egypt to a man named Potiphar, who was the king's official in charge of the palace guard."
Genesis,38,1,About that time Judah left his brothers in the hill country and went to live near his friend Hirah in the town of Adullam.
Genesis,38,2,"While there he met the daughter of Shua, a Canaanite man. Judah married her,"
Genesis,38,3,and they had three sons. He named the first one Er;
Genesis,38,4,she named the next one Onan.
Genesis,38,5,"The third one was born when Judah was in Chezib, and she named him Shelah."
Genesis,38,6,"Later, Judah chose Tamar as a wife for Er, his eldest son."
Genesis,38,7,"But Er was very evil, and the LORD took his life."
Genesis,38,8,"So Judah told Onan, “It's your duty to marry Tamar and have a child for your brother.”"
Genesis,38,9,"Onan knew the child would not be his, and when he had sex with Tamar, he made sure that she would not get pregnant."
Genesis,38,10,The LORD wasn't pleased with Onan and took his life too.
Genesis,38,11,"Judah did not want the same thing to happen to his son Shelah, and he told Tamar, “Go home to your father and live there as a widow until my son Shelah is grown up.” So Tamar went to live with her father."
Genesis,38,12,"Some years later Judah's wife died, and he mourned for her. He then went with his friend Hirah to the town of Timnah, where his sheep were being sheared."
Genesis,38,13,Tamar found out that her father-in-law Judah was going to Timnah to shear his sheep.
Genesis,38,14,"She also realized that Shelah was now a grown man, but she had not been allowed to marry him. So she decided to dress in something other than her widow's clothes and to cover her face with a veil. After this, she sat outside the town of Enaim on the road to Timnah."
Genesis,38,15,"When Judah came along, he did not recognize her because of the veil. He thought she was a prostitute"
Genesis,38,16,"and asked her to sleep with him. She asked, “What will you give me if I do?”"
Genesis,38,17,"“One of my young goats,” he answered. “What will you give me to keep until you send the goat?” she asked."
Genesis,38,18,"“What do you want?” he asked in return. “The ring on that cord around your neck,” was her reply. “I also want the special walking stick you have with you.” He gave them to her, they slept together, and she became pregnant."
Genesis,38,19,"After returning home, Tamar took off the veil and dressed in her widow's clothes again."
Genesis,38,20,"Judah sent his friend Hirah to take a goat to the woman, so he could get back the ring and walking stick, but she wasn't there."
Genesis,38,21,"Hirah asked the people of Enaim, “Where is the prostitute who sat along the road outside your town?” “There's never been one here,” they answered."
Genesis,38,22,"Hirah went back and told Judah, “I couldn't find the woman, and the people of Enaim said no prostitute had ever been there.”"
Genesis,38,23,"“If you couldn't find her, we'll just let her keep the things I gave her,” Judah answered. “And we'd better forget about the goat, or else we'll look like fools.”"
Genesis,38,24,"About three months later someone told Judah, “Your daughter-in-law Tamar has behaved like a prostitute, and now she's pregnant!” “Drag her out of town and burn her to death!” Judah shouted."
Genesis,38,25,"As Tamar was being dragged off, she sent someone to tell her father-in-law, “The man who gave me this ring, this cord, and this walking stick is the one who got me pregnant.”"
Genesis,38,26,"“Those are mine!” Judah admitted. “She's a better person than I am, because I broke my promise to let her marry my son Shelah.” After this, Judah never slept with her again."
Genesis,39,1,"The Ishmaelites took Joseph to Egypt and sold him to Potiphar, the king's official in charge of the palace guard."
Genesis,41,1,Two years later the king of Egypt dreamed he was standing beside the River Nile.
Genesis,41,2,"Suddenly, seven fat, healthy cows came up from the river and started eating grass along the bank."
Genesis,41,3,"Then seven ugly, skinny cows came up out of the river and"
Genesis,41,4,"ate the fat, healthy cows. When this happened, the king woke up."
Genesis,41,5,The king went back to sleep and had another dream. This time seven full heads of grain were growing on a single stalk.
Genesis,41,6,"Later, seven other heads of grain appeared, but they were thin and scorched by the east wind."
Genesis,41,7,"The thin heads of grain swallowed the seven full heads. Again the king woke up, and it had only been a dream."
Genesis,41,8,The next morning the king was upset. So he called in his magicians and wise men and told them what he had dreamed. None of them could tell him what the dreams meant.
Genesis,41,9,The king's personal servant said: Now I remember what I was supposed to do.
Genesis,41,10,"When you were angry with me and your chief cook, you threw us both in jail in the house of the captain of the guard."
Genesis,41,11,"One night we both had dreams, and each dream had a different meaning."
Genesis,41,12,"A young Hebrew, who was a servant of the captain of the guard, was there with us at the time. When we told him our dreams, he explained what each of them meant,"
Genesis,41,13,"and everything happened just as he said it would. I got my job back, and the cook was put to death."
Genesis,41,14,"The king sent for Joseph, who was quickly brought out of jail. He shaved, changed his clothes, and went to the king."
Genesis,41,15,"The king said to him, “I had a dream, yet no one can explain what it means. I am told that you can interpret dreams.”"
Genesis,41,16,"“Your Majesty,” Joseph answered, “I can't do it myself, but God can give a good meaning to your dreams.”"
Genesis,41,17,The king told Joseph: I dreamed I was standing on the bank of the River Nile.
Genesis,41,18,"I saw seven fat, healthy cows come up out of the river, and they began feeding on the grass."
Genesis,41,19,"Next, seven skinny, bony cows came up out of the river. I have never seen such terrible looking cows anywhere in Egypt."
Genesis,41,20,The skinny cows ate the fat ones.
Genesis,41,21,"But you couldn't tell it, because these skinny cows were just as skinny as they were before. Straight away, I woke up."
Genesis,41,22,I also dreamed that I saw seven heads of grain growing on one stalk. The heads were full and ripe.
Genesis,41,23,Then seven other heads of grain came up. They were thin and scorched by a wind from the desert.
Genesis,41,24,"These heads of grain swallowed the full ones. I told my dreams to the magicians, but none of them could tell me the meaning of the dreams."
Genesis,41,25,"Joseph replied: Your Majesty, both of your dreams mean the same thing, and in them God has shown what he is going to do."
Genesis,41,26,"The seven good cows stand for seven years, and so do the seven good heads of grain."
Genesis,41,27,"The seven skinny, ugly cows that came up later also stand for seven years, as do the seven bad heads of grain that were scorched by the east wind. The dreams mean there will be seven years when there won't be enough grain."
Genesis,41,28,It is just as I said—God has shown what he intends to do.
Genesis,41,29,"For seven years Egypt will have more than enough grain,"
Genesis,41,30,"but that will be followed by seven years when there won't be enough. The good years of plenty will be forgotten, and everywhere in Egypt people will be starving."
Genesis,41,31,The famine will be so bad that no one will remember that once there had been plenty.
Genesis,41,32,God has given you two dreams to let you know that he has definitely decided to do this and that he will do it soon.
Genesis,41,33,"Your Majesty, you should find someone who is wise and will know what to do, so that you can put him in charge of all Egypt."
Genesis,41,34,Then appoint some other officials to collect one-fifth of every crop harvested in Egypt during the seven years when there is plenty.
Genesis,41,35,Give them the power to collect the grain during those good years and to store it in your cities.
Genesis,41,36,It can be stored until it is needed during the seven years when there won't be enough grain in Egypt. This will keep the country from being destroyed because of the lack of food.
Genesis,41,37,The king and his officials liked this plan.
Genesis,41,38,"So the king said to them, “No one could possibly handle this better than Joseph, since the Spirit of God is with him.”"
Genesis,41,39,"The king told Joseph, “God is the one who has shown you these things. No one else is as wise as you are or knows as much as you do."
Genesis,41,40,"I'm putting you in charge of my palace, and everybody will have to obey you. No one will be over you except me."
Genesis,41,41,You are now governor of all Egypt!”
Genesis,41,42,Then the king took off his royal ring and put it on Joseph's finger. He gave him fine clothes to wear and placed a gold chain around his neck.
Genesis,41,43,"He also let him ride in the chariot next to his own, and people shouted, “Make way for Joseph!” So Joseph was governor of Egypt."
Genesis,41,44,"The king told Joseph, “Although I'm king, no one in Egypt is to do anything without your permission.”"
Genesis,41,45,"He gave Joseph the Egyptian name Zaphenath Paneah. And he let him marry Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, a priest in the city of Heliopolis. Joseph travelled all over Egypt."
Genesis,41,46,"Joseph was thirty when the king made him governor, and he went everywhere for the king."
Genesis,41,47,For seven years there were big harvests of grain.
Genesis,41,48,Joseph collected and stored up the extra grain in the cities of Egypt near the fields where it was harvested.
Genesis,41,49,"In fact, there was so much grain that they stopped keeping record, because it was like counting the grains of sand along the beach."
Genesis,41,50,Joseph and his wife had two sons before the famine began.
Genesis,41,51,"Their first son was named Manasseh, which means, “God has let me forget all my troubles and my family back home.”"
Genesis,41,52,"His second son was named Ephraim, which means “God has made me a success in the land where I suffered.”"
Genesis,41,53,"Egypt's seven years of plenty came to an end,"
Genesis,41,54,"and the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had said. There was not enough food in other countries, but all over Egypt there was plenty."
Genesis,41,55,"When the famine finally struck Egypt, the people asked the king for food, but he said, “Go to Joseph and do what he tells you to do.”"
Genesis,41,56,"The famine became bad everywhere in Egypt, so Joseph opened the storehouses and sold the grain to the Egyptians."
Genesis,41,57,"People from all over the world came to Egypt, because the famine was severe in their countries."
Genesis,42,1,"When Jacob found out there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, “Why are you just sitting here, staring at one another?"
Genesis,42,2,"I have heard there is grain in Egypt. Now go down and buy some, so we won't starve to death.”"
Genesis,42,3,Ten of Joseph's brothers went to Egypt to buy grain.
Genesis,42,4,But Jacob did not send Joseph's younger brother Benjamin with them; he was afraid that something might happen to him.
Genesis,42,5,So Jacob's sons joined others from Canaan who were going to Egypt because of the terrible famine.
Genesis,42,6,"Since Joseph was governor of Egypt and in charge of selling grain, his brothers came to him and bowed with their faces to the ground."
Genesis,43,1,"The famine in Canaan got worse,"
Genesis,43,2,"until finally, Jacob's family had eaten all the grain they had bought in Egypt. So Jacob said to his sons, “Go back and buy some more grain.”"
Genesis,45,1,"Since Joseph could no longer control his feelings in front of his servants, he sent them out of the room. When he was alone with his brothers, he told them, “I am Joseph.”"
Genesis,45,2,Then he cried so loudly that the Egyptians heard him and told about it in the king's palace.
Genesis,45,3,"Joseph asked his brothers if his father was still alive, but they were too frightened to answer."
Genesis,45,4,"Joseph told them to come closer to him, and when they did, he said: Yes, I am your brother Joseph, the one you sold into Egypt."
Genesis,45,5,Don't worry or blame yourselves for what you did. God is the one who sent me ahead of you to save lives.
Genesis,45,6,"There has already been a famine for two years, and for five more years no one will plough fields or harvest grain."
Genesis,45,7,But God sent me on ahead of you to keep your families alive and to save you in this wonderful way.
Genesis,45,8,"After all, you weren't really the ones who sent me here—it was God. He made me the highest official in the king's court and placed me over all Egypt."
Genesis,45,9,"Now hurry back and tell my father that his son Joseph says, “God has made me ruler of Egypt. Come here as quickly as you can."
Genesis,45,10,"You will live near me in the region of Goshen with your children and grandchildren, as well as with your sheep, goats, cattle, and everything else you own."
Genesis,45,11,"I will take care of you there during the next five years of famine. But if you don't come, you and your family and your animals will starve to death.”"
Genesis,45,12,"All of you, including my brother Benjamin, can tell by what I have said that I really am Joseph."
Genesis,45,13,Tell my father about my great power here in Egypt and about everything you have seen. Hurry and bring him here.
Genesis,45,14,Joseph and Benjamin hugged each other and started crying.
Genesis,45,15,"Joseph was still crying as he kissed each of his other brothers. After this, they started talking with Joseph."
Genesis,45,16,"When it was told in the palace that Joseph's brothers had come, the king and his officials were happy."
Genesis,45,17,So the king said to Joseph: Tell your brothers to load their donkeys and return to Canaan.
Genesis,45,18,"They must bring their father and their families here. I will give them the best land in Egypt, and they can eat and enjoy everything that grows on it."
Genesis,45,19,Also tell your brothers to take some wagons from Egypt for their wives and children to ride in. And they must be sure to bring their father.
Genesis,45,20,"They can leave their possessions behind, because they will be given the best of everything in Egypt."
Genesis,45,21,"Jacob's sons agreed to do what the king had said. And Joseph gave them wagons and food for their trip home, just as the king had ordered."
Genesis,45,22,"Joseph gave some new clothes to each of his brothers, but to Benjamin he gave five new outfits and three hundred pieces of silver."
Genesis,45,23,"To his father he sent ten donkeys loaded with the best things in Egypt, and ten other donkeys loaded with grain and bread and other food for the return trip."
Genesis,45,24,"Then he sent his brothers off and told them, “Don't argue on the way home!”"
Genesis,45,25,"Joseph's brothers left Egypt, and when they arrived in Canaan,"
Genesis,45,26,they told their father that Joseph was still alive and was the ruler of Egypt. But their father was so surprised that he could not believe them.
Genesis,45,27,"Then they told him everything Joseph had said. When he saw the wagons Joseph had sent, he felt much better"
Genesis,45,28,"and said, “Now I can believe you! My son Joseph must really be alive, and I will get to see him before I die.”"
Genesis,46,1,Jacob packed up everything he owned and left for Egypt. On the way he stopped near the town of Beersheba and offered sacrifices to the God his father Isaac had worshipped.
Genesis,46,2,"That night, God spoke to him and said, “Jacob! Jacob!” “Here I am,” Jacob answered."
Genesis,46,3,"God said, “I am God, the same God your father worshipped. Don't be afraid to go to Egypt. I will give you so many descendants that one day they will become a nation."
Genesis,46,4,"I will go with you to Egypt, and later I will bring your descendants back here. Your son Joseph will be at your side when you die.”"
Genesis,48,1,"Joseph was told that his father Jacob had become very sick. So Joseph went to see him and took along his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim."
Genesis,48,2,"When Joseph arrived, someone told Jacob, “Your son Joseph has come to see you.” Jacob sat up in bed, but it took almost all his strength."
Genesis,48,3,"Jacob told Joseph: God All-Powerful appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, where he gave me his blessing"
Genesis,48,4,"and promised, “I will give you a large family with many descendants that will grow into a nation. And I am giving you this land that will belong to you and your family for ever.”"
Genesis,48,5,"Then Jacob went on to say: Joseph, your two sons Ephraim and Manasseh were born in Egypt, but I accept them as my own, just as Reuben and Simeon are mine."
Genesis,48,6,"Any children you have later will be considered yours, but their inheritance will come from Ephraim and Manasseh."
Genesis,48,7,"Unfortunately, your mother Rachel died in Canaan after we had left northern Syria and before we reached Bethlehem. And I had to bury her along the way."
Genesis,50,1,"Joseph started crying, then leaned over to hug and kiss his father."
Genesis,50,2,"Joseph gave orders for Jacob's body to be embalmed,"
Genesis,50,3,and it took the usual forty days. The Egyptians mourned seventy days for Jacob.
Genesis,50,4,"When the time of mourning was over, Joseph said to the Egyptian leaders, “If you consider me your friend, please speak to the king for me."
Genesis,50,5,"Just before my father died, he made me promise to bury him in his burial cave in Canaan. If the king will give me permission to go, I will come back here.”"
Genesis,50,6,"The king answered, “Go to Canaan and keep your promise to your father.”"
Exodus,2,1,"A man from the Levi tribe married a woman from the same tribe,"
Exodus,2,2,"and she later had a baby boy. He was a beautiful child, and she kept him inside for three months."
Exodus,2,3,"But when she could no longer keep him hidden, she made a basket out of reeds and covered it with tar. She put him in the basket and placed it in the tall grass along the edge of the River Nile."
Exodus,2,4,The baby's elder sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.
Exodus,2,5,"About that time one of the king's daughters came down to take a bath in the river, while her servant women walked along the river bank. She saw the basket in the tall grass and sent one of the young women to pull it out of the water."
Exodus,2,6,"When the king's daughter opened the basket, she saw the baby and felt sorry for him because he was crying. She said, “This must be one of the Hebrew babies.”"
Exodus,2,7,"At once the baby's elder sister came up and asked, “Do you want me to get a Hebrew woman to take care of the baby for you?”"
Exodus,2,8,"“Yes,” the king's daughter answered. So the girl brought the baby's mother,"
Exodus,2,9,"and the king's daughter told her, “Take care of this child, and I will pay you.” The baby's mother carried him home and took care of him."
Exodus,2,10,"And when he was old enough, she took him to the king's daughter, who adopted him. She named him Moses because she said, “I pulled him out of the water.”"
Exodus,2,11,"After Moses had grown up, he went out to where his own people were hard at work, and he saw an Egyptian beating one of them."
Exodus,2,12,"Moses looked around to see if anyone was watching, then he killed the Egyptian and hid his body in the sand."
Exodus,2,13,"When Moses went out the next day, he saw two Hebrews fighting. So he went to the man who had started the fight and asked, “Why are you beating up one of your own people?”"
Exodus,2,14,"The man answered, “Who put you in charge of us and made you our judge? Are you planning to kill me, just as you killed that Egyptian?” This frightened Moses because he was sure that people must have found out what had happened."
Exodus,2,15,"When the king heard what Moses had done, the king wanted to kill him. But Moses escaped and went to the land of Midian. One day, Moses was sitting there by a well,"
Exodus,2,16,"when the seven daughters of Jethro, the priest of Midian, came up to water their father's sheep and goats."
Exodus,2,17,"Some shepherds tried to chase them away, but Moses came to their rescue and watered their animals."
Exodus,2,18,"When Jethro's daughters returned home, their father asked, “Why have you come back so early today?”"
Exodus,2,19,"They answered, “An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds, and he even watered our sheep and goats.”"
Exodus,2,20,“Where is he?” Jethro asked. “Why did you leave him out there? Invite him to eat with us.”
Exodus,2,21,"Moses agreed to stay on with Jethro, who later let his daughter Zipporah marry Moses."
Exodus,2,22,"And when she had a son, Moses said, “I will name him Gershom, since I am a foreigner in this country.”"
Exodus,2,23,"After the death of the king of Egypt, the Israelites still complained because they were forced to be slaves. They cried out for help,"
Exodus,2,24,"and God heard their loud cries. He did not forget the promise he had made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,"
Exodus,2,25,"and because he knew what was happening to his people, he felt sorry for them."
Exodus,3,1,"One day, Moses was taking care of the sheep and goats of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian, and Moses decided to lead them across the desert to Sinai, the holy mountain."
Exodus,3,2,"There an angel of the LORD appeared to him from a burning bush. Moses saw that the bush was on fire, but it was not burning up."
Exodus,3,3,“This is strange!” he said to himself. “I'll go over and see why the bush isn't burning up.”
Exodus,3,4,"When the LORD saw Moses coming near the bush, he called him by name, and Moses answered, “Here I am.”"
Exodus,3,5,"God replied, “Don't come any closer. Take off your sandals—the ground where you are standing is holy."
Exodus,3,6,"I am the God who was worshipped by your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.” Moses was afraid to look at God, and so he hid his face."
Exodus,3,7,"The LORD said: I have seen how my people are suffering as slaves in Egypt, and I have heard them beg for my help because of the way they are being ill-treated. I feel sorry for them,"
Exodus,3,8,"and I have come down to rescue them from the Egyptians. I will bring my people out of Egypt into a country where there is good land, rich with milk and honey. I will give them the land where the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites now live."
Exodus,3,9,"My people have begged for my help, and I have seen how cruel the Egyptians are to them."
Exodus,3,10,Now go to the king! I am sending you to lead my people out of his country.
Exodus,3,11,"But Moses said, “Who am I to go to the king and lead your people out of Egypt?”"
Exodus,3,12,"God replied, “I will be with you. And you will know that I am the one who sent you, when you worship me on this mountain after you have led my people out of Egypt.”"
Exodus,3,13,"Moses answered, “I will tell the people of Israel that the God their ancestors worshipped has sent me to them. But what should I say, if they ask me your name?”"
Exodus,4,1,"Moses asked the LORD , “Suppose everyone refuses to listen to my message, and no one believes that you really appeared to me?”"
Exodus,4,2,"The LORD answered, “What's that in your hand?” “A walking stick,” Moses replied."
Exodus,4,3,"“Throw it down!” the LORD commanded. So Moses threw the stick on the ground. It immediately turned into a snake, and Moses jumped back."
Exodus,4,4,"“Pick it up by the tail!” the LORD told him. And when Moses did this, the snake turned back into a walking stick."
Exodus,4,5,"“Do this,” the LORD said, “and the Israelites will believe that you have seen me, the God who was worshipped by their ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”"
Exodus,4,6,"Next, the LORD commanded Moses, “Put your hand inside your shirt.” Moses obeyed, and when he took it out, his hand had turned white as snow—like someone with leprosy."
Exodus,4,7,"“Put your hand back inside your shirt,” the LORD told him. Moses did so, and when he took it out again, it was as healthy as the rest of his body."
Exodus,5,1,"Moses and Aaron went to the king of Egypt and told him, “The LORD God says, ‘Let my people go into the desert, so they can honour me with a celebration there.’ ”"
Exodus,5,2,“Who is this LORD and why should I obey him?” the king replied. “I refuse to let you and your people go!”
Exodus,5,3,"They answered, “The LORD God of the Hebrews, has appeared to us. Please let us walk three days into the desert where we can offer sacrifices to him. If you don't, he may strike us down with terrible troubles or with war.”"
Exodus,6,1,"The LORD God told Moses: Soon you will see what I will do to the king. Because of my mighty power, he will let my people go, and he will even chase them out of his country."
Exodus,6,2,My name is the LORD.
Exodus,6,3,"But when I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, I came as God All-Powerful and did not use my name."
Exodus,6,4,"I made an agreement and promised them the land of Canaan, where they were living as foreigners."
Exodus,6,5,"Now I have seen how the people of Israel are suffering because of the Egyptians, and I will keep my promise."
Exodus,6,6,Here is my message for Israel: “I am the LORD ! And with my mighty power I will punish the Egyptians and free you from slavery.
Exodus,6,7,"I will accept you as my people, and I will be your God. Then you will know that I was the one who rescued you from the Egyptians."
Exodus,6,8,"I will bring you into the land that I solemnly promised Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and it will be yours. I am the LORD !”"
Exodus,6,9,"When Moses told this to the Israelites, they were too discouraged and ill-treated to believe him."
Exodus,6,10,Then the LORD told Moses
Exodus,6,11,to demand that the king of Egypt let the Israelites leave.
Exodus,6,12,"But Moses replied, “I'm not a powerful speaker. If the Israelites won't listen to me, why should the king of Egypt?”"
Exodus,6,13,But the LORD sent Aaron and Moses with a message for the Israelites and for the king; he also ordered Aaron and Moses to free the people from Egypt.
Exodus,6,14,"The following men were the heads of their ancestral clans: The sons of Reuben, Jacob's eldest son, were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi."
Exodus,6,15,"The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman."
Exodus,6,16,"Levi lived to be one hundred and thirty-seven; his sons were Gershon, Kohath, and Merari."
Exodus,6,17,Gershon's sons were Libni and Shimei.
Exodus,6,18,"Kohath lived to be one hundred and thirty-three; his sons were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel."
Exodus,6,19,Merari's sons were Mahli and Mushi. All of the above were from the Levi tribe.
Exodus,6,20,"Amram lived to be one hundred and thirty-seven. He married his father's sister Jochebed, and they had two sons, Aaron and Moses."
Exodus,6,21,"Izhar's sons were Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri."
Exodus,6,22,"Uzziel's sons were Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri."
Exodus,6,23,"Aaron married Elisheba. She was the daughter of Amminadab and the sister of Nahshon; they had four sons, Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar."
Exodus,6,24,"Korah's sons were Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph."
Exodus,6,25,"Aaron's son Eleazar married one of Putiel's daughters, and their son was Phinehas. This ends the list of those who were the heads of clans in the Levi tribe."
Exodus,6,26,"The LORD had commanded Aaron and Moses to lead every family and tribe of Israel out of Egypt,"
Exodus,6,27,and so they ordered the king of Egypt to set the people of Israel free.
Exodus,6,28,"When the LORD spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,"
Exodus,6,29,"he said, “I am the LORD . Tell the king of Egypt everything I say to you.”"
Exodus,6,30,"But Moses answered, “You know I am a very poor speaker, and the king will never listen to me.”"
Exodus,7,1,"The LORD said: I am going to let your brother Aaron speak for you. He will tell your message to the king, just as a prophet speaks my message to the people."
Exodus,7,2,"Tell Aaron everything I say to you, and he will order the king to let my people leave his country."
Exodus,8,1,"he said to Moses: Go to the palace and tell the king of Egypt that I order him to let my people go, so they can worship me."
Exodus,8,2,"If he refuses, I will cover his entire country with frogs."
Exodus,8,3,"Warn the king that the Nile will be full of frogs, and from there they will spread into the royal palace, including the king's bedroom and even his bed. Frogs will enter the homes of his officials and will find their way into ovens and into the bowls of bread dough."
Exodus,8,4,"Frogs will be crawling on everyone—the king, his officials, and every citizen of Egypt."
Exodus,8,5,"Moses, now command Aaron to hold his stick over the water. Then frogs will come from all rivers, canals, and ponds in Egypt, and they will cover the land."
Exodus,8,6,"Aaron obeyed, and suddenly frogs were everywhere in Egypt."
Exodus,8,7,But the magicians used their secret powers to do the same thing.
Exodus,8,8,"The king sent for Moses and Aaron and told them, “If you ask the LORD to take these frogs away from me and my people, I will let your people go and offer sacrifices to him.”"
Exodus,8,9,"“All right,” Moses answered. “You choose the time when I am to pray for the frogs to stop bothering you, your officials, and your people, and for them to leave your houses and be found only in the river.”"
Exodus,8,10,"“Do it tomorrow!” the king replied. “As you wish,” Moses agreed. “Then everyone will discover that there is no god like the LORD,"
Exodus,8,11,"and frogs will no longer be found anywhere, except in the Nile.”"
Exodus,8,12,"After Moses and Aaron left the palace, Moses begged the LORD to do something about the frogs he had sent as punishment for the king."
Exodus,8,13,"The LORD listened to Moses, and frogs died everywhere—in houses, yards, and fields."
Exodus,8,14,"The dead frogs were placed in piles, and the whole country began to stink."
Exodus,8,15,"But when the king saw that things were now better, he again did just as the LORD had said and stubbornly refused to listen to Moses and Aaron."
Exodus,8,16,"The LORD said to Moses, “Command Aaron to strike the ground with his walking stick, and everywhere in Egypt the dust will turn into gnats.”"
Exodus,8,17,"They obeyed, and when Aaron struck the ground with the stick, gnats started swarming on people and animals. In fact, every speck of dust in Egypt turned into a gnat."
Exodus,8,18,"When the magicians tried to use their secret powers to do this, they failed, and gnats stayed on people and animals."
Exodus,8,19,"The magicians told the king, “God has done this.” But, as the LORD had said, the king was too stubborn to listen."
Exodus,8,20,"The LORD said to Moses: Early tomorrow morning, while the king is on his way to the river, go and say to him, “The LORD commands you to let his people go, so they can worship him."
Exodus,8,21,"If you don't, he will send swarms of flies to attack you, your officials, and every citizen of your country. Houses will be full of flies, and the ground will crawl with them."
Exodus,9,1,"The LORD sent Moses with this message for the king of Egypt: The LORD God of the Hebrews commands you to let his people go, so they can worship him."
Exodus,9,2,"If you keep refusing,"
Exodus,9,3,"he will bring a terrible disease on your horses and donkeys, your camels and cattle, and your sheep and goats."
Exodus,9,4,"But the LORD will protect the animals that belong to the people of Israel, and none of theirs will die."
Exodus,9,5,Tomorrow is the day the LORD has set to do this.
Exodus,9,6,"It happened the next day—all the animals belonging to the Egyptians died, but the Israelites did not lose even one."
Exodus,9,7,"When the king found out, he was still too stubborn to let the people go."
Exodus,9,8,The LORD said to Moses and Aaron: Take a few handfuls of ashes from a stove and let Moses throw them into the air. Be sure the king is watching.
Exodus,9,9,"The ashes will blow across the land of Egypt, causing sores to break out on people and animals."
Exodus,9,10,"So they took a few handfuls of ashes and went to the king. Moses threw them into the air, and sores immediately broke out on the Egyptians and their animals."
Exodus,9,11,"The magicians were suffering so much from the sores, that they could not even come to Moses."
Exodus,9,12,Everything happened just as the LORD had told Moses—he made the king too stubborn to listen to Moses and Aaron.
Exodus,9,13,"The LORD told Moses to get up early the next morning and say to the king: The LORD God of the Hebrews commands you to let his people go, so they can worship him!"
Exodus,9,14,"If you don't, he will send his worst plagues to strike you, your officials, and everyone else in your country. Then you will find out that no one can oppose the LORD."
Exodus,9,15,"In fact, he could already have sent a terrible disease and wiped you from the face of the earth."
Exodus,9,16,"But he has kept you alive, just to show you his power and to bring honour to himself everywhere in the world."
Exodus,9,17,You are still determined not to let the LORD 's people go.
Exodus,9,18,"All right. At this time tomorrow, he will bring on Egypt the worst hailstorm in its history."
Exodus,9,19,"You had better give orders for every person and every animal in Egypt to take shelter. If they don't, they will die."
Exodus,9,20,"Some of the king's officials were frightened by what the LORD had said, and they hurried off to make sure their slaves and animals were safe."
Exodus,9,21,But others paid no attention to his threats and left their slaves and animals out in the open.
Exodus,9,22,"Then the LORD told Moses, “Stretch your arm towards the sky, so that hailstones will fall on people, animals, and crops in the land of Egypt.”"
Exodus,10,1,"The LORD said to Moses: Go back to the king. I have made him and his officials stubborn, so that I could work these miracles."
Exodus,10,2,I did this because I want you to tell your children and your grandchildren about my miracles and about my harsh treatment of the Egyptians. Then all of you will know that I am the LORD.
Exodus,10,3,Moses and Aaron went to the king and told him that the LORD God of the Hebrews had said: How long will you stubbornly refuse to obey? Release my people so they can worship me.
Exodus,10,4,"Do this by tomorrow, or I will cover your country with so many locusts"
Exodus,10,5,"that you won't be able to see the ground. Most of your crops were ruined by the hailstones, but these locusts will destroy what little is left, including the trees."
Exodus,10,6,"Your palace, the homes of your officials, and all other houses in Egypt will overflow with more locusts than have ever been seen in this country. After Moses left the palace,"
Exodus,10,7,"the king's officials asked, “Your Majesty, how much longer is this man going to be a troublemaker? Why don't you let the people leave, so they can worship the LORD their God? Don't you know that Egypt is a disaster?”"
Exodus,10,8,"The king had Moses and Aaron brought back, and he said, “All right, you may go and worship the LORD your God. But first tell me who will be going.”"
Exodus,10,9,"“Everyone, young and old,” Moses answered. “We will even take our sheep, goats, and cattle, because we want to hold a celebration in honour of the LORD .”"
Exodus,10,10,"The king replied, “The LORD had better watch over you on the day I let you leave with your families! You're up to no good."
Exodus,10,11,"Do you want to worship the LORD ? All right, take only the men and go.” Then Moses and Aaron were chased out of the palace."
Exodus,10,12,"The LORD told Moses, “Stretch your arm towards Egypt. Swarms of locusts will come and eat everything left by the hail.”"
Exodus,10,13,"Moses held out his walking stick, and the LORD sent an east wind that blew across Egypt the rest of the day and all that night. By morning, locusts"
Exodus,10,14,"were swarming everywhere. Never before had there been so many locusts in Egypt, and never again will there be so many."
Exodus,10,15,"The ground was black with locusts, and they ate everything left on the trees and in the fields. Nothing green remained in Egypt—not a tree or a plant."
Exodus,10,16,"At once the king sent for Moses and Aaron. He told them, “I have sinned against the LORD your God and against you."
Exodus,10,17,Forgive me one more time and ask the LORD to stop these insects from killing every living plant.”
Exodus,10,18,Moses left the palace and prayed.
Exodus,10,19,"Then the LORD sent a strong west wind that swept the locusts into the Red Sea. Not one locust was left anywhere in Egypt,"
Exodus,10,20,but the LORD made the king so stubborn that he still refused to let the Israelites go.
Exodus,10,21,"The LORD said to Moses, “Stretch your arm towards the sky, and everything will be covered with darkness thick enough to touch.”"
Exodus,10,22,"Moses stretched his arm towards the sky, and Egypt was covered with darkness for three days."
Exodus,10,23,"During that time, the Egyptians could not see each other or leave their homes, but there was light where the Israelites lived."
Exodus,10,24,"The king sent for Moses and told him, “Go and worship the LORD ! And take your families with you. Just leave your sheep, goats, and cattle.”"
Exodus,10,25,"“No!” Moses replied. “You must let us offer sacrifices to the LORD our God,"
Exodus,10,26,and we won't know which animals we will need until we get there. That's why we can't leave even one of them here.”
Exodus,10,27,This time the LORD made the king so stubborn
Exodus,10,28,"that he said to Moses, “Get out and stay out! If you ever come back, you're dead!”"
Exodus,10,29,"“Have it your way,” Moses answered. “You won't see me again.”"
Exodus,11,1,"The LORD said to Moses: I am going to punish the king of Egypt and his people one more time. Then the king will gladly let you leave his land, so that I will stop punishing the Egyptians. He will even chase you out."
Exodus,11,2,Now go and tell my people to ask their Egyptian neighbours for gold and silver jewellery.
Exodus,11,3,"So the LORD made the Egyptians greatly respect the Israelites, and everyone, including the king and his officials, considered Moses an important leader."
Exodus,11,4,"Moses went to the king and said: I have come to let you know what the LORD is going to do. About midnight he will go through the land of Egypt,"
Exodus,11,5,"and wherever he goes, the firstborn son in every family will die. Your own son will die, and so will the son of the lowest slave woman. Even the firstborn males of cattle will die."
Exodus,11,6,Everywhere in Egypt there will be loud crying. Nothing like this has ever happened before or will ever happen again.
Exodus,11,7,"But there won't be any need for the Israelites to cry. Things will be so quiet that not even a dog will be heard barking. Then you Egyptians will know that the LORD is good to the Israelites, even while he punishes you."
Exodus,11,8,"Your leaders will come and bow down, begging me to take my people and leave your country. Then we will leave. Moses was very angry; he turned and left the king."
Exodus,11,9,"What the LORD had earlier said to Moses came true. He had said, “The king of Egypt won't listen. Then I will perform even more miracles.”"
Exodus,11,10,"So the king of Egypt saw Moses and Aaron work miracles, but the LORD made him stubbornly refuse to let the Israelites leave his country."
Exodus,12,1,Some time later the LORD said to Moses and Aaron:
Exodus,12,2,This month is to be the first month of the year for you.
Exodus,12,3,Tell the people of Israel that on the tenth day of this month the head of each family must choose a lamb or a young goat for his family to eat.
Exodus,13,1,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Exodus,13,2,“Dedicate to me the firstborn son of every family and the firstborn males of your flocks and herds. These belong to me.”
Exodus,14,1,At Etham the LORD said to Moses:
Exodus,14,2,"Tell the people of Israel to turn back and camp across from Pi-Hahiroth near Baal-Zephon, between Migdol and the Red Sea."
Exodus,14,3,"The king will think they were afraid to cross the desert and that they are wandering around, trying to find another way to leave the country."
Exodus,14,4,"I will make the king stubborn again, and he will try to catch you. Then I will destroy him and his army. People everywhere will praise me for my victory, and the Egyptians will know that I really am the LORD. The Israelites obeyed the LORD and camped where he told them."
Exodus,14,5,"When the king of Egypt heard that the Israelites had finally left, he and his officials changed their minds and said, “Look what we have done! We let them get away, and they will no longer be our slaves.”"
Exodus,14,6,The king got his war chariot and army ready.
Exodus,14,7,He commanded his officers in charge of his six hundred best chariots and all his other chariots to start after the Israelites.
Exodus,14,8,"The LORD made the king so stubborn that he went after them, even though the Israelites proudly went on their way."
Exodus,14,9,But the king's horses and chariots and soldiers caught up with them while they were camping by the Red Sea near Pi-Hahiroth and Baal-Zephon.
Exodus,14,10,"When the Israelites saw the king coming with his army, they were frightened and begged the LORD for help."
Exodus,14,11,"They also complained to Moses, “Wasn't there enough room in Egypt to bury us? Is that why you brought us out here to die in the desert? Why did you bring us out of Egypt anyway?"
Exodus,14,12,"While we were there, didn't we tell you to leave us alone? We would rather be slaves in Egypt than die in this desert!”"
Exodus,14,13,"But Moses answered, “Don't be afraid! Be brave, and you will see the LORD save you today. These Egyptians will never bother you again."
Exodus,14,14,"The LORD will fight for you, and you won't have to do a thing.”"
Exodus,14,15,"The LORD said to Moses, “Why do you keep calling out to me for help? Tell the Israelites to move forward."
Exodus,14,16,Then hold your walking stick over the sea. The water will open up and make a road where they can walk through on dry ground.
Exodus,14,17,I will make the Egyptians so stubborn that they will go after you. Then I will be praised because of what happens to the king and his chariots and cavalry.
Exodus,14,18,The Egyptians will know for sure that I am the LORD .”
Exodus,14,19,"All this time God's angel had gone ahead of Israel's army, but now he moved behind them. A large cloud had also gone ahead of them,"
Exodus,14,20,"but now it moved between the Egyptians and the Israelites. The cloud gave light to the Israelites, but made it dark for the Egyptians, and during the night they could not come any closer."
Exodus,14,21,"Moses stretched his arm over the sea, and the LORD sent a strong east wind that blew all night until there was dry land where the water had been. The sea opened up,"
Exodus,14,22,and the Israelites walked through on dry land with a wall of water on each side.
Exodus,14,23,The Egyptian chariots and cavalry went after them.
Exodus,14,24,But before daylight the LORD looked down at the Egyptian army from the fiery cloud and made them panic.
Exodus,14,25,"Their chariot wheels got stuck, and it was hard for them to move. So the Egyptians said to one another, “Let's leave these people alone! The LORD is on their side and is fighting against us.”"
Exodus,14,26,"The LORD told Moses, “Stretch your arm towards the sea—the water will cover the Egyptians and their cavalry and chariots.”"
Exodus,14,27,"Moses stretched out his arm, and at daybreak the water rushed towards the Egyptians. They tried to run away, but the LORD drowned them in the sea."
Exodus,14,28,"The water came and covered the chariots, the cavalry, and the whole Egyptian army that had followed the Israelites into the sea. Not one of them was left alive."
Exodus,14,29,But the sea had made a wall of water on each side of the Israelites; so they walked through on dry land.
Exodus,14,30,"On that day, when the Israelites saw the bodies of the Egyptians washed up on the shore, they knew that the LORD had saved them."
Exodus,14,31,"Because of the mighty power he had used against the Egyptians, the Israelites worshipped him and trusted him and his servant Moses."
Exodus,15,1,Moses and the Israelites sang this song in praise of the LORD: I sing praises to the LORD for his great victory! He has thrown the horses and their riders into the sea.
Exodus,15,2,"The LORD is my strength, the reason for my song, because he has saved me. I praise and honour the LORD — he is my God and the God of my ancestors."
Exodus,15,3,"The LORD is his name, and he is a warrior!"
Exodus,15,4,"He threw the chariots and army of Egypt's king into the Red Sea, and he drowned the best of the king's officers."
Exodus,15,5,They sank to the bottom just like stones.
Exodus,15,6,"With the tremendous force of your right arm, our LORD, you crushed your enemies."
Exodus,15,7,"What a great victory was yours, as you defeated everyone who opposed you. Your fiery anger wiped them out, as though they were straw."
Exodus,15,8,"You were so furious that the sea piled up like a wall, and the ocean depths curdled like cheese."
Exodus,15,9,"Your enemies boasted that they would pursue and capture us, divide up our possessions, treat us as they wished, then take out their swords and kill us there."
Exodus,15,10,"But when you got furious, they sank like lead, swallowed by ocean waves."
Exodus,15,11,"Our LORD , no other gods compare with you— Majestic and holy! Fearsome and glorious! Miracle worker!"
Exodus,15,12,"When you signalled with your right hand, your enemies were swallowed deep into the earth."
Exodus,15,13,The people you rescued were led by your powerful love to your holy place.
Exodus,15,14,Nations learnt of this and trembled— Philistines shook with horror.
Exodus,15,15,"The leaders of Edom and of Moab were terrified. Everyone in Canaan fainted,"
Exodus,15,16,"struck down by fear. Our LORD , your powerful arm kept them still as a rock until the people you rescued for your very own had marched by."
Exodus,15,17,"You will let your people settle on your chosen mountain, where you built your home and your temple."
Exodus,15,18,"Our LORD , you will rule for ever!"
Exodus,15,19,"The LORD covered the royal Egyptian cavalry and chariots with the sea, after the Israelites had walked safely through on dry ground."
Exodus,15,20,Miriam the sister of Aaron was a prophet. So she took her tambourine and led the other women out to play their tambourines and to dance.
Exodus,15,21,Then she sang to them: “Sing praises to the LORD for his great victory! He has thrown the horses and their riders into the sea.”
Exodus,15,22,"After the Israelites left the Red Sea, Moses led them through the Shur Desert for three days, before finding water."
Exodus,15,23,"They did find water at Marah, but it was bitter, which is how that place got its name."
Exodus,15,24,"The people complained and said, “Moses, what are we going to drink?”"
Exodus,15,25,"Moses asked the LORD for help, and the LORD told him to throw a piece of wood into the water. Moses did so, and the water became fit to drink. At Marah the LORD tested his people and also gave them some laws and teachings."
Exodus,15,26,"Then he said, “I am the LORD your God, and I cure your diseases. If you obey me by doing right and by following my laws and teachings, I won't punish you with the diseases I sent on the Egyptians.”"
Exodus,15,27,"Later the Israelites came to Elim, where there were twelve springs and seventy palm trees. So they camped there."
Exodus,16,1,"On the fifteenth day of the second month after the Israelites had escaped from Egypt, they left Elim and started through the western edge of the Sinai Desert in the direction of Mount Sinai."
Exodus,16,2,"There in the desert they started complaining to Moses and Aaron,"
Exodus,16,3,"“We wish the LORD had killed us in Egypt. When we lived there, we could at least sit down and eat all the bread and meat we wanted. But you have brought us out here into this desert, where we are going to starve.”"
Exodus,16,4,"The LORD said to Moses, “I will send bread down from heaven like rain. Each day the people can go out and gather only enough for that day. That's how I will see if they obey me."
Exodus,16,5,But on the sixth day of each week they must gather and cook twice as much.”
Exodus,16,6,"Moses and Aaron told the people, “This evening you will know that the LORD was the one who rescued you from Egypt."
Exodus,16,7,"And in the morning you will see his glorious power, because he has heard your complaints against him. Why should you grumble to us? Who are we?”"
Exodus,16,8,"Then Moses continued, “You will know it is the LORD when he gives you meat each evening and more than enough bread each morning. He is really the one you are complaining about, not us—we are nobodies—but the LORD has heard your complaints.”"
Exodus,16,9,"Moses turned to Aaron and said, “Bring the people together, because the LORD has heard their complaints.”"
Exodus,16,10,"Aaron was speaking to them, when everyone looked out towards the desert and saw the bright glory of the LORD in a cloud."
Exodus,16,11,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Exodus,16,12,“I have heard my people complain. Now tell them that each evening they will have meat and each morning they will have more than enough bread. Then they will know that I am the LORD their God.”
Exodus,16,13,"That evening a lot of quails came and landed everywhere in the camp, and the next morning dew covered the ground."
Exodus,16,14,"After the dew had gone, the desert was covered with thin flakes that looked like frost."
Exodus,16,15,"The people had never seen anything like this, and they started asking each other, “What is it?” Moses answered, “This is the bread that the LORD has given you to eat."
Exodus,16,16,And he orders you to gather about two litres for each person in your family—that should be more than enough.”
Exodus,16,17,"They did as they were told. Some gathered more and some gathered less,"
Exodus,16,18,"according to their needs, and none was left over."
Exodus,16,19,Moses told them not to keep any overnight.
Exodus,16,20,"Some of them disobeyed, but the next morning what they kept was stinking and full of worms, and Moses was angry."
Exodus,16,21,"Each morning everyone gathered as much as they needed, and in the heat of the day the rest melted."
Exodus,16,22,"However, on the sixth day of the week, everyone gathered enough to have four litres, instead of two. When the leaders reported this to Moses,"
Exodus,16,23,"he told them that the LORD had said, “Tomorrow is the Sabbath, a sacred day of rest in honour of me. So gather all you want to bake or boil, and make sure you save enough for tomorrow.”"
Exodus,16,24,"The people obeyed, and the next morning the food smelt fine and had no worms."
Exodus,16,25,"“You may eat the food,” Moses said. “Today is the Sabbath in honour of the LORD , and there won't be any of this food on the ground today."
Exodus,16,26,"You will find it there for the first six days of the week, but not on the Sabbath.”"
Exodus,16,27,"A few of the Israelites did go out to look for some, but there was none."
Exodus,16,28,"Then the LORD said, “Moses, how long will you people keep disobeying my laws and teachings?"
Exodus,16,29,Remember that I was the one who gave you the Sabbath. That's why on the sixth day I provide enough bread for two days. Everyone is to stay at home and rest on the Sabbath.”
Exodus,16,30,And so they rested on the Sabbath.
Exodus,16,31,The Israelites called the bread manna. It was white like coriander seed and delicious as wafers made with honey.
Exodus,16,32,"Moses told the people that the LORD had said, “Store up two litres of this manna, because I want future generations to see the food I gave you during the time you were in the desert after I rescued you from Egypt.”"
Exodus,16,33,"Then Moses told Aaron, “Put some manna in a jar and store it in the place of worship for future generations to see.”"
Exodus,16,34,Aaron followed the LORD 's instructions and put the manna in front of the sacred chest for safekeeping.
Exodus,17,1,"The Israelites left the desert and moved from one place to another each time the LORD ordered them to. Once they camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for them to drink."
Exodus,17,2,"The people started complaining to Moses, “Give us some water!” Moses replied, “Why are you complaining to me and trying to put the LORD to the test?”"
Exodus,17,3,"But the people were thirsty and kept on complaining, “Moses, did you bring us out of Egypt just to let us and our families and our animals die of thirst?”"
Exodus,17,4,"Then Moses prayed to the LORD , “What am I going to do with these people? They are about to stone me to death!”"
Exodus,17,5,"The LORD answered, “Take some of the leaders with you and go ahead of the rest of the people. Also take along the walking stick you used to strike the River Nile,"
Exodus,17,6,"and when you get to the rock at Mount Sinai, I will be there with you. Strike the rock with the stick, and water will pour out for the people to drink.” Moses did this while the leaders watched."
Exodus,17,7,"The people had complained and tested the LORD by asking, “Is the LORD really with us?” So Moses named that place Massah, which means “testing” and Meribah, which means “complaining”."
Exodus,17,8,"When the Israelites were at Rephidim, they were attacked by the Amalekites."
Exodus,17,9,"So Moses told Joshua, “Have some men ready to attack the Amalekites tomorrow. I will stand on a hilltop, holding this walking stick that has the power of God.”"
Exodus,17,10,"Joshua led the attack as Moses had commanded, while Moses, Aaron, and Hur stood on the hilltop."
Exodus,17,11,"The Israelites out-fought the Amalekites as long as Moses held up his arms, but they started losing whenever he had to lower them."
Exodus,17,12,"Finally, Moses was so tired that Aaron and Hur got a rock for him to sit on. Then they stood beside him and supported his arms in the same position until sunset."
Exodus,17,13,That's how Joshua defeated the Amalekites.
Exodus,17,14,"Afterwards, the LORD said to Moses, “Write an account of this victory and read it to Joshua. I want the Amalekites to be forgotten for ever.”"
Exodus,17,15,Moses built an altar and named it “The LORD Gives me Victory”.
Exodus,17,16,"Then Moses explained, “This is because I depended on the LORD. But in future generations, the LORD will have to fight the Amalekites again.”"
Exodus,18,1,"Jethro was the priest of Midian and the father-in-law of Moses. And he heard what the LORD God had done for Moses and his people, after rescuing them from Egypt."
Exodus,20,1,God said to the people of Israel:
Exodus,20,2,"I am the LORD your God, the one who brought you out of Egypt where you were slaves."
Exodus,20,3,Do not worship any god except me.
Exodus,20,4,Do not make idols that look like anything in the sky or on earth or in the sea under the earth.
Exodus,20,5,"Don't bow down and worship idols. I am the LORD your God, and I demand all your love. If you reject me, I will punish your families for three or four generations."
Exodus,20,6,"But if you love me and obey my laws, I will be kind to your families for thousands of generations."
Exodus,20,7,"Do not misuse my name. I am the LORD your God, and I will punish anyone who misuses my name."
Exodus,20,8,Remember that the Sabbath Day belongs to me.
Exodus,20,9,"You have six days when you can do your work,"
Exodus,20,10,"but the seventh day of each week belongs to me, your God. No one is to work on that day—not you, your children, your slaves, your animals, or the foreigners who live in your towns."
Exodus,20,11,"In six days I made the sky, the earth, the seas, and everything in them, but on the seventh day I rested. That's why I made the Sabbath a special day that belongs to me."
Exodus,20,12,"Respect your father and your mother, and you will live a long time in the land I am giving you."
Exodus,20,13,Do not murder.
Exodus,20,14,Be faithful in marriage.
Exodus,20,15,Do not steal.
Exodus,20,16,Do not tell lies about others.
Exodus,20,17,"Do not want to take anything that belongs to someone else. Don't want to take anyone's house, wife or husband, slaves, oxen, donkeys or anything else."
Exodus,20,18,The people trembled with fear when they heard the thunder and the trumpet and saw the lightning and the smoke coming from the mountain. They stood a long way off
Exodus,20,19,"and said to Moses, “If you speak to us, we will listen. But don't let God speak to us, or we will die!”"
Exodus,20,20,"“Don't be afraid!” Moses replied. “God has come only to test you, so that by obeying him you won't sin.”"
Exodus,20,21,"But when Moses went near the thick cloud where God was, the people stayed a long way off."
Exodus,20,22,"The LORD told Moses to say to the people of Israel: With your own eyes, you saw me speak to you from heaven."
Exodus,20,23,So you must never make idols of silver or gold to worship in place of me.
Exodus,20,24,"Build an altar out of earth, and offer on it your sacrifices of sheep, goats, and cattle. Wherever I choose to be worshipped, I will come down to bless you."
Exodus,20,25,"If you ever build an altar for me out of stones, do not use any tools to chisel the stones, because that would make the altar unfit."
Exodus,20,26,And don't build an altar that requires steps; you might expose yourself when you climb up.
Exodus,21,1,The LORD gave Moses the following laws for his people:
Exodus,21,2,"If you buy a Hebrew slave, he must remain your slave for six years. But in the seventh year you must set him free, without cost to him."
Exodus,21,3,"If he was single at the time you bought him, he alone must be set free. But if he was married at the time, both he and his wife must be given their freedom."
Exodus,21,4,"If you give him a wife, and they have children, only the man himself must be set free; his wife and children remain the property of his owner."
Exodus,21,5,But suppose the slave loves his wife and children so much that he won't leave without them.
Exodus,21,6,"Then he must stand beside either the door or the doorpost at the place of worship, while his owner punches a small hole through one of his ears with a sharp metal rod. This makes him a slave for life."
Exodus,21,7,A young woman who was sold by her father doesn't gain her freedom in the same way that a man does.
Exodus,21,8,"If she doesn't please the man who bought her to be his wife, he must let her be bought back. He cannot sell her to foreigners; this would break the contract he made with her."
Exodus,21,9,"If he selects her as a wife for his son, he must treat her as his own daughter."
Exodus,21,10,"If the man later marries another woman, he must continue to provide food and clothing for the one he bought and to treat her as a wife."
Exodus,21,11,"If he fails to do any of these things, she must be given her freedom without cost."
Exodus,21,12,Death is the punishment for murder.
Exodus,21,13,"But if you did not intend to kill someone, and I, the LORD , let it happen anyway, you may run for safety to a place that I have set aside."
Exodus,21,14,"If you plan in advance to murder someone, there's no escape, not even by holding on to my altar. You will be dragged off and killed."
Exodus,21,15,Death is the punishment for attacking your father or mother.
Exodus,21,16,"Death is the punishment for kidnapping. If you sell the person you kidnapped, or if you are caught with that person, the penalty is death."
Exodus,21,17,Death is the punishment for cursing your father or mother.
Exodus,21,18,"Suppose two of you are arguing, and you hit the other with either a rock or your fist, without causing a fatal injury. If the victim has to stay in bed,"
Exodus,21,19,"and later has to use a stick when walking outside, you must pay for the loss of time and do what you can to help until the injury is completely healed. That's your only responsibility."
Exodus,21,20,Death is the punishment for beating to death any of your slaves.
Exodus,21,21,"However, if the slave lives a few days after the beating, you are not to be punished. After all, you have already lost the services of that slave who was your property."
Exodus,21,22,"Suppose a pregnant woman suffers a miscarriage as the result of an injury caused by someone who is fighting. If she isn't badly hurt, the one who injured her must pay whatever fine her husband demands and the judges approve."
Exodus,21,23,"But if she is seriously injured, the payment will be life for life,"
Exodus,21,24,"eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,"
Exodus,21,25,"burn for burn, cut for cut, and bruise for bruise."
Exodus,21,26,"If you hit one of your slaves and cause the loss of an eye, the slave must be set free."
Exodus,21,27,The same law applies if you knock out a slave's tooth—the slave goes free.
Exodus,21,28,"A bull that kills someone with its horns must be killed and its meat destroyed, but the owner of the bull isn't responsible for the death."
Exodus,21,29,"Suppose you own a bull that has been in the habit of attacking people, but you have refused to keep it fenced in. If that bull kills someone, both you and the bull must be put to death by stoning."
Exodus,21,30,"However, you may save your own life by paying whatever fine is demanded."
Exodus,21,31,This same law applies if the bull gores someone's son or daughter.
Exodus,21,32,"If the bull kills a slave, you must pay the slave owner thirty pieces of silver for the loss of the slave, and the bull must be killed by stoning."
Exodus,21,33,Suppose someone's ox or donkey is killed by falling into an open pit that you dug or left uncovered on your property.
Exodus,21,34,"You must pay for the dead animal, and it becomes yours."
Exodus,21,35,"If your bull kills someone else's, yours must be sold. Then the money from your bull and the meat from the dead bull must be divided equally between you and the other owner."
Exodus,21,36,"If you refuse to fence in a bull that is known to attack others, you must pay for any animal it kills, but the dead animal will belong to you."
Exodus,22,1,"If you steal an ox and slaughter or sell it, you must replace it with five oxen; if you steal a sheep and slaughter it or sell it, you must replace it with four sheep."
Exodus,23,1,Don't spread harmful rumours or help a criminal by giving false evidence.
Exodus,23,2,"Always tell the truth in court, even if everyone else is dishonest and stands in the way of justice."
Exodus,23,3,"And don't favour the poor, simply because they are poor."
Exodus,23,4,"If you find an ox or a donkey that has wandered off, take it back where it belongs, even if the owner is your enemy."
Exodus,23,5,"If a donkey is overloaded and falls down, you must do what you can to help, even if it belongs to someone who doesn't like you."
Exodus,23,6,Make sure that the poor are given equal justice in court.
Exodus,23,7,Don't bring false charges against anyone or sentence an innocent person to death. I won't forgive you if you do.
Exodus,23,8,Don't accept bribes. Judges are blinded and justice is twisted by bribes.
Exodus,23,9,"Don't ill-treat foreigners. You were foreigners in Egypt, and you know what it is like."
Exodus,23,10,"Plant and harvest your crops for six years,"
Exodus,23,11,"but let the land rest during the seventh year. The poor are to eat what they want from your fields, vineyards, and olive trees during that year, and when they have all they want from your fields, leave the rest for wild animals."
Exodus,23,12,"Work the first six days of the week, but rest and relax on the seventh day. This law is not only for you, but for your oxen, donkeys, and slaves, as well as for any foreigners among you."
Exodus,23,13,Make certain that you obey everything I have said. Don't pray to other gods or even mention their names.
Exodus,23,14,Celebrate three festivals each year in my honour.
Exodus,23,15,"Celebrate the Festival of Thin Bread by eating bread made without yeast, just as I have commanded. Do this at the proper time during the month of Abib, because it is the month when you left Egypt. And make certain that everyone brings the proper offerings."
Exodus,23,16,"Celebrate the Harvest Festival each spring when you start harvesting your wheat, and celebrate the Festival of Shelters each autumn when you pick your fruit."
Exodus,23,17,Your men must come to these three festivals each year to worship me.
Exodus,23,18,Do not offer bread made with yeast when you sacrifice an animal to me. And make sure that the fat of the animal is burnt that same day.
Exodus,23,19,Each year bring the best part of your first harvest to the place of worship. Don't boil a young goat in its mother's milk.
Exodus,23,20,I am sending an angel to protect you and to lead you into the land I have ready for you.
Exodus,23,21,"Carefully obey everything the angel says, because I am giving him complete authority, and he won't tolerate rebellion."
Exodus,23,22,"If you faithfully obey him, I will be a fierce enemy of your enemies."
Exodus,23,23,"My angel will lead you into the land of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hivites, and Jebusites, and I will wipe them out."
Exodus,23,24,"Don't worship their gods or follow their customs. Instead, destroy their idols and shatter their stone images."
Exodus,23,25,"Worship only me, the LORD your God! I will bless you with plenty of food and water and keep you strong."
Exodus,23,26,"Your women will give birth to healthy children, and everyone will live a long life."
Exodus,23,27,I will terrify those nations and make your enemies so confused that they will run from you.
Exodus,23,28,"I will make the Hivites, Canaanites, and Hittites panic as you approach."
Exodus,23,29,"But I won't do all this in the first year, because the land would become poor, and wild animals would be everywhere."
Exodus,23,30,"Instead, I will force out your enemies little by little and give your nation time to grow strong enough to take over the land."
Exodus,23,31,"I will see that your borders reach from the Red Sea to the River Euphrates and from the Mediterranean Sea to the desert. I will let you defeat the people who live there, and you will force them out of the land."
Exodus,23,32,But you must not make any agreements with them or with their gods.
Exodus,23,33,Don't let them stay in your land. They will trap you into sinning against me and worshipping their gods.
Exodus,24,1,"The LORD said to Moses, “Come up to me on this mountain. Bring along Aaron, as well as his two sons Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of Israel's leaders. They must worship me at a distance,"
Exodus,24,2,but you are to come near. Don't let anyone else come up.”
Exodus,24,3,"Moses gave the LORD 's instructions to the people, and they promised, “We will do everything the LORD has commanded!”"
Exodus,24,4,Then Moses wrote down what the LORD had said. The next morning Moses got up early. He built an altar at the foot of the mountain and set up a large stone for each of the twelve tribes of Israel.
Exodus,24,5,He also sent some young men to burn offerings and to sacrifice bulls as special offerings to the LORD.
Exodus,24,6,Moses put half of the blood from the animals into bowls and sprinkled the rest on the altar.
Exodus,24,7,"Then he read aloud the LORD 's commands and promises, and the people shouted, “We will obey the LORD and do everything he has commanded!”"
Exodus,24,8,"Moses took the blood from the bowls and sprinkled it on the people. Next, he told them, “With this blood the LORD makes his agreement with you.”"
Exodus,24,9,"Moses and Aaron, together with Nadab and Abihu and the seventy leaders, went up the mountain"
Exodus,24,10,"and saw the God of Israel. Under his feet was something that looked like a pavement made out of sapphire, and it was as bright as the sky."
Exodus,24,11,"Even though these leaders of Israel saw God, he did not punish them. So they ate and drank."
Exodus,24,12,"The LORD said to Moses, “Come up on the mountain and stay here for a while. I will give you the two flat stones on which I have written the laws that my people must obey.”"
Exodus,24,13,"Moses and Joshua his assistant got ready, then Moses started up the mountain to meet with God."
Exodus,24,14,"Moses had told the leaders, “Wait here until we come back. Aaron and Hur will be with you, and they can settle any arguments while we are away.”"
Exodus,24,15,"When Moses went up on Mount Sinai, a cloud covered it,"
Exodus,24,16,"and the bright glory of the LORD came down and stayed there. The cloud covered the mountain for six days, and on the seventh day the LORD told Moses to come into the cloud."
Exodus,25,1,The LORD said to Moses:
Exodus,25,2,Tell everyone in Israel who wants to give gifts that they must bring them to you.
Exodus,25,3,"Here is a list of what you are to collect: gold, silver, and bronze;"
Exodus,25,4,"blue, purple, and red wool; fine linen; goat hair;"
Exodus,25,5,tanned ram skins; fine leather; acacia wood;
Exodus,25,6,olive oil for the lamp; sweet-smelling spices to mix with the oil for dedicating the tent and ordaining the priests;
Exodus,25,7,and onyx stones for the sacred apron and the breastpiece.
Exodus,25,8,I also want them to build a special place where I can live among my people.
Exodus,25,9,Make it and its furnishings exactly like the pattern I will show you.
Exodus,25,10,"Tell the people to build a chest of acacia wood one hundred and ten centimetres long, sixty-six centimetres wide, and sixty-six centimetres high."
Exodus,25,11,Cover it inside and out with pure gold and put a gold edging around the lid.
Exodus,25,12,Make four gold rings and fasten one of them to each of the four legs of the chest.
Exodus,25,13,Make two poles of acacia wood. Cover them with gold
Exodus,25,14,"and put them through the rings, so the chest can be carried by the poles."
Exodus,25,15,Don't ever remove the poles from the rings.
Exodus,25,16,"When I give you the Ten Commandments written on two flat stones, put them inside the chest."
Exodus,25,17,Cover the lid of the chest with pure gold.
Exodus,26,1,"Furnish the sacred tent with curtains made from ten pieces of the finest linen. They must be woven with blue, purple, and red wool and embroidered with figures of winged creatures."
Exodus,26,2,Make each piece twelve metres long and two metres wide
Exodus,26,3,and sew them together into two curtains with five sections each.
Exodus,27,1,"Use acacia wood to build an altar two and a quarter metres square and one and a third metres high,"
Exodus,27,2,"and make each of the four top corners stick up like the horn of a bull. Then cover the whole altar with bronze, including the four horns."
Exodus,27,3,"All the equipment for the altar must also be made of bronze—the pans for the hot ashes, the shovels, the sprinkling bowls, the meat forks, and the fire pans."
Exodus,28,1,"Send for your brother Aaron and his sons Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. They are the ones I have chosen from Israel to serve as my priests."
Exodus,28,2,Make Aaron some beautiful clothes that are worthy of a high priest.
Exodus,28,3,"Aaron is to be dedicated as my high priest, and his clothes must be made only by persons who possess skills that I have given them."
Exodus,28,4,"Here are the items that need to be made: a breastpiece, a priestly apron, a robe, an embroidered shirt, a turban, and a sash. These sacred clothes are to be made for your brother Aaron and his sons who will be my priests."
Exodus,28,5,"Only gold and fine linen, woven with blue, purple, and red wool, are to be used for making these clothes."
Exodus,29,1,"When you ordain one of Aaron's sons as my priest, choose a young bull and two rams that have nothing wrong with them."
Exodus,29,2,"Then from your finest flour make three batches of dough without yeast. Shape some of it into larger loaves, some into smaller loaves mixed with olive oil, and the rest into thin wafers brushed with oil."
Exodus,29,3,Put all this bread in a basket and bring it when you come to sacrifice the three animals to me.
Exodus,29,4,Bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the sacred tent and make them wash themselves.
Exodus,29,5,"Dress Aaron in the priestly shirt, the robe that goes under the sacred apron, the apron itself, the breastpiece, and the sash."
Exodus,29,6,Put on his turban with its narrow strip of engraved gold
Exodus,29,7,and then ordain him by pouring olive oil on his head.
Exodus,29,8,"Next, dress Aaron's sons in their special shirts"
Exodus,29,9,"and caps and their sashes, then ordain them, because they and their descendants will always be priests."
Exodus,29,10,"Lead the bull to the entrance of the sacred tent, where Aaron and his sons will lay their hands on its head."
Exodus,29,11,Kill the bull near my altar in front of the tent.
Exodus,29,12,Use a finger to smear some of its blood on each of the four corners of the altar and pour out the rest of the blood on the ground next to the altar.
Exodus,29,13,"Then take the fat from the animal's insides, as well as the lower part of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat, and send them up in smoke on the altar."
Exodus,29,14,"But the meat, the skin, and the food still in the bull's stomach must be burnt outside the camp as an offering to ask forgiveness for the sins of the priests."
Exodus,29,15,Bring one of the rams to Aaron and his sons and make them lay their hands on its head.
Exodus,29,16,Kill the ram and splatter its blood against all four sides of the altar.
Exodus,29,17,"Cut up the ram, wash its insides and legs, and lay all its parts on the altar, including the head."
Exodus,29,18,Then make sure that the whole animal goes up in smoke with a smell that pleases me.
Exodus,29,19,Bring the other ram to Aaron and his sons and make them lay their hands on its head.
Exodus,29,20,"Kill the ram and place some of its blood on Aaron's right ear lobe, his right thumb, and the big toe of his right foot. Do the same for each of his sons and splatter the rest of the blood against the four sides of the altar."
Exodus,29,21,"Then take some of the blood from the altar, mix it with the oil used for ordination, and sprinkle it on Aaron and his clothes, and also on his sons and their clothes. This will show that they and their clothes have been dedicated to me."
Exodus,29,22,"This ram is part of the ordination service. So remove its right hind leg, its fat tail, the fat on its insides, as well as the lower part of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat."
Exodus,29,23,"Take one loaf of each kind of bread from the basket,"
Exodus,29,24,"and put this bread, together with the meat, into the hands of Aaron and his sons. Then they will lift it all up to show that it is dedicated to me."
Exodus,29,25,"After this, the meat and bread are to be placed on the altar and sent up in smoke with a smell that pleases me."
Exodus,29,26,"You may eat the choice ribs from this second ram, but you must first lift them up to show that this meat is dedicated to me."
Exodus,30,1,Build an altar of acacia wood where you can burn incense.
Exodus,30,2,"Make it forty-five centimetres square and ninety centimetres high, and make each of its four corners stick up like the horn of a bull."
Exodus,30,3,Cover it with pure gold and put a gold edging around it.
Exodus,30,4,Then below the edging on opposite sides attach two gold rings through which you can put the poles for carrying the altar.
Exodus,30,5,These poles are also to be made of acacia wood covered with gold.
Exodus,30,6,"Put the altar in front of the inside curtain of the sacred tent. The chest with the place of mercy is kept behind that curtain, and I will talk with you there."
Exodus,31,1,The LORD said to Moses:
Exodus,31,2,I have chosen Bezalel from the Judah tribe to make the sacred tent and its furnishings.
Exodus,32,1,"After the people saw that Moses had been on the mountain for a long time, they went to Aaron and said, “Make us an image of a god who will lead and protect us. Moses brought us out of Egypt, but nobody knows what has happened to him.”"
Exodus,32,2,"Aaron told them, “Bring me the gold earrings that your wives and sons and daughters are wearing.”"
Exodus,32,3,"Everybody took off their earrings and brought them to Aaron,"
Exodus,32,4,"then he melted them and made an idol in the shape of a young bull. All the people said to one another, “This is the god who brought us out of Egypt!”"
Exodus,32,5,"When Aaron saw what was happening, he built an altar in front of the idol and said, “Tomorrow we will celebrate in honour of the LORD .”"
Exodus,32,6,The people got up early the next morning and killed some animals to be used for sacrifices and others to be eaten. Then everyone ate and drank so much that they began to carry on like wild people.
Exodus,32,7,The LORD said to Moses: Hurry back down! Those people you led out of Egypt are acting like fools.
Exodus,32,8,"They have already stopped obeying me and have made themselves an idol in the shape of a young bull. They have bowed down to it, offered sacrifices, and said that it is the god who brought them out of Egypt."
Exodus,32,9,"Moses, I have seen how stubborn these people are,"
Exodus,32,10,"and I'm angry enough to destroy them, so don't try to stop me. But I will make your descendants into a great nation."
Exodus,32,11,"Moses tried to get the LORD God to change his mind: Our LORD , you used your mighty power to bring these people out of Egypt. Now don't become angry and destroy them."
Exodus,32,12,"If you do, the Egyptians will say that you brought your people out here into the mountains just to get rid of them. Please don't be angry with your people. Don't destroy them!"
Exodus,32,13,"Remember the solemn promise you made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. You promised that some day they would have as many descendants as there are stars in the sky and that you would give them land."
Exodus,32,14,"So even though the LORD had threatened to destroy the people, he changed his mind and let them live."
Exodus,33,1,"The LORD said to Moses: You led the people of Israel out of Egypt. Now get ready to lead them to the land I promised their ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."
Exodus,34,1,"One day the LORD said to Moses, “Cut two flat stones like the first ones I made, and I will write on them the same commandments that were on the two you broke."
Exodus,34,2,Be ready tomorrow morning to come up Mount Sinai and meet me at the top.
Exodus,34,3,No one is to come with you or to be on the mountain at all. Don't even let the sheep and cattle graze at the foot of the mountain.”
Exodus,34,4,"So Moses cut two flat stones like the first ones, and early the next morning he carried them to the top of Mount Sinai, just as the LORD had commanded."
Exodus,34,5,"The LORD God came down in a cloud and stood beside Moses there on the mountain. God spoke his holy name, “the LORD ”."
Exodus,34,6,"Then he passed in front of Moses and called out, “I am the LORD God. I am merciful and very patient with my people. I show great love, and I can be trusted."
Exodus,34,7,"I keep my promises to my people for ever, but I also punish anyone who sins. When people sin, I punish them and their children, and also their grandchildren and great-grandchildren.”"
Exodus,34,8,Moses quickly bowed down to the ground and worshipped the LORD.
Exodus,34,9,"He prayed, “ LORD , if you really are pleased with me, I pray that you will go with us. It is true that these people are sinful and rebellious, but forgive our sin and let us be your people.”"
Exodus,34,10,The LORD said: I promise to perform miracles for you that have never been seen anywhere on earth. Neighbouring nations will stand in fear and know that I was the one who did these marvellous things.
Exodus,34,11,"I will force out the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, but you must do what I command you today."
Exodus,34,12,"Don't make treaties with any of those people. If you do, it will be like falling into a trap."
Exodus,34,13,"Instead, you must destroy their altars and tear down the sacred poles they use in the worship of the goddess Asherah."
Exodus,34,14,I demand your complete loyalty—you must not worship any other god!
Exodus,34,15,"Don't make treaties with the people there, or you will soon find yourselves worshipping their gods and taking part in their sacrificial meals."
Exodus,34,16,Your men will even marry their women and be influenced to worship their gods.
Exodus,34,17,Don't make metal images of gods.
Exodus,34,18,"Don't fail to observe the Festival of Thin Bread in the month of Abib. Obey me and eat bread without yeast for seven days during Abib, because that is the month you left Egypt."
Exodus,34,19,The firstborn males of your families and of your flocks and herds belong to me.
Exodus,34,20,"You can save the life of a firstborn donkey by sacrificing a lamb; if you don't, you must break the donkey's neck. You must save every firstborn son. Bring an offering every time you come to worship."
Exodus,34,21,"Do your work in six days and rest on the seventh day, even during the seasons for ploughing and harvesting."
Exodus,34,22,"Celebrate the Harvest Festival each spring when you start harvesting your wheat, and celebrate the Festival of Shelters each autumn when you pick your fruit."
Exodus,34,23,"Your men must come to worship me three times a year, because I am the LORD God of Israel."
Exodus,34,24,I will force the nations out of your land and enlarge your borders. Then no one will try to take your property when you come to worship me these three times each year.
Exodus,34,25,"When you sacrifice an animal on the altar, don't offer bread made with yeast. And don't save any part of the Passover meal for the next day."
Exodus,34,26,"I am the LORD your God, and you must bring the first part of your harvest to the place of worship. Don't boil a young goat in its mother's milk."
Exodus,34,27,"The LORD told Moses to put these laws in writing, as part of his agreement with Israel."
Exodus,34,28,"Moses stayed on the mountain with the LORD for forty days and nights, without eating or drinking. And he wrote down the Ten Commandments, the most important part of God's agreement with his people."
Exodus,34,29,"Moses came down from Mount Sinai, carrying the Ten Commandments. His face was shining brightly because the LORD had been speaking to him. But Moses did not know at first that his face was shining."
Exodus,34,30,"When Aaron and the others looked at Moses, they saw that his face was shining, and they were afraid to go near him."
Exodus,34,31,"Moses called out for Aaron and the leaders to come to him, and he spoke with them."
Exodus,34,32,"Then the rest of the people of Israel gathered around Moses, and he gave them the laws that the LORD had given him on Mount Sinai."
Exodus,34,33,"The face of Moses kept shining, and after he had spoken with the people, he covered his face with a veil."
Exodus,34,34,"Moses would always remove the veil when he went into the sacred tent to speak with the LORD . And when he came out, he would tell the people everything the LORD had told him to say."
Exodus,34,35,"They could see that his face was still shining. So after he had spoken with them, he would put the veil back on and leave it on until the next time he went to speak with the LORD."
Exodus,35,1,Moses called together the people of Israel and told them that the LORD had said:
Exodus,35,2,"You have six days in which to do your work. But the seventh day must be dedicated to me, your LORD , as a day of rest. Whoever works on the Sabbath will be put to death."
Exodus,35,3,Don't even build a cooking fire at home on the Sabbath.
Exodus,35,4,Moses told the people of Israel that the LORD had said:
Exodus,35,5,"I would welcome an offering from anyone who wants to give something. You may bring gold, silver, or bronze;"
Exodus,35,6,"blue, purple, or red wool; fine linen; goat hair;"
Exodus,35,7,tanned ram skin or fine leather; acacia wood;
Exodus,35,8,olive oil for the lamp; sweet-smelling spices for the oil of dedication and for the incense; or
Exodus,35,9,onyx stones or other gems for the sacred apron and breastpiece.
Exodus,35,10,"If you have any skills, you should use them to help make what I have commanded:"
Exodus,35,11,"the sacred tent with its covering and hooks, its framework and crossbars, and its post and stands;"
Exodus,35,12,"the sacred chest with its carrying poles, its place of mercy, and the curtain in front of it;"
Exodus,35,13,"the table with all that goes on it, including the sacred bread;"
Exodus,35,14,the lamp with its equipment and oil;
Exodus,35,15,the incense altar with its carrying poles and sweet-smelling incense; the ordination oil; the curtain for the entrance to the sacred tent;
Exodus,35,16,"the altar for sacrifices with its bronze grating, its carrying poles, and its equipment; the large bronze bowl with its stand;"
Exodus,35,17,the curtains with the posts and stands that go around the courtyard;
Exodus,35,18,the pegs and ropes for the tent and the courtyard;
Exodus,35,19,and the finely woven priestly clothes for Aaron and his sons.
Exodus,35,20,"Moses finished speaking, and everyone left."
Exodus,35,21,"Then those who wanted to bring gifts to the LORD , brought them to be used for the sacred tent, the worship services, and the priestly clothes."
Exodus,35,22,"Men and women came willingly and gave all kinds of gold jewellery such as pins, earrings, rings, and necklaces."
Exodus,35,23,"Everyone brought their blue, purple, and red wool, their fine linen, and their cloth made of goat hair, as well as their ram skins dyed red and their fine leather."
Exodus,35,24,Anyone who had silver or bronze or acacia wood brought it as a gift to the LORD.
Exodus,35,25,"The women who were good at weaving cloth brought the blue, purple, and red wool and the fine linen they had made."
Exodus,35,26,And the women who knew how to make cloth from goat hair were glad to do so.
Exodus,35,27,The leaders brought different kinds of jewels to be sewn on the special clothes and the breastpiece for the high priest.
Exodus,35,28,They also brought sweet-smelling spices to be mixed with the incense and olive oil that were for the lamps and for ordaining the priests.
Exodus,35,29,"Moses had told the people what the LORD wanted them to do, and many of them decided to bring their gifts."
Exodus,35,30,Moses said to the people of Israel: The LORD has chosen Bezalel of the Judah tribe.
Exodus,36,1,"The LORD has given to Bezalel, Oholiab, and others the skills needed for building a place of worship, and they will follow the LORD 's instructions."
Exodus,36,2,"Then Moses brought together these workers who were eager to work,"
Exodus,36,3,"and he gave them the money that the people of Israel had donated for building the place of worship. In fact, so much money was being given each morning,"
Exodus,36,4,that finally everyone stopped working
Exodus,36,5,"and said, “Moses, there is already more money than we need for what the LORD has assigned us to do.”"
Exodus,36,6,"So Moses sent word for the people to stop giving, and they did."
Exodus,36,7,But there was already more than enough to do what needed to be done.
Exodus,37,1,"Bezalel built a chest of acacia wood one hundred and ten centimetres long, sixty-six centimetres wide, and sixty-six centimetres high."
Exodus,37,2,He covered it inside and out with pure gold and put a gold edging around the top.
Exodus,37,3,He made four gold rings and fastened one of them to each of the four legs of the chest.
Exodus,37,4,"Then he made two poles of acacia wood, covered them with gold,"
Exodus,37,5,"and put them through the rings, so the chest could be carried by the poles."
Exodus,37,6,"The entire lid of the chest, which was also covered with pure gold, was the place of mercy."
Exodus,38,1,Bezalel built an altar of acacia wood for offering sacrifices. It was two and a quarter metres square and one and a third metres high
Exodus,38,2,"with each of its four corners sticking up like the horn of a bull, and it was completely covered with bronze."
Exodus,38,3,"The equipment for the altar was also made of bronze—the pans for the hot ashes, the shovels, the meat forks, and the fire pans."
Exodus,38,4,Half-way up the altar he built a ledge around it and covered the bottom half of the altar with a decorative bronze grating.
Exodus,38,5,Then he attached a bronze ring beneath the ledge at the four corners to put the poles through.
Exodus,38,6,He covered two acacia wood poles with bronze and
Exodus,38,7,"put them through the rings for carrying the altar, which was shaped like an open box."
Exodus,38,8,Bezalel made a large bowl and a stand out of bronze from the mirrors of the women who helped at the entrance to the sacred tent.
Exodus,39,1,"Beautiful priestly clothes were made of blue, purple, and red wool for Aaron to wear when he performed his duties in the holy place. This was done exactly as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Exodus,40,1,The LORD said to Moses:
Exodus,40,2,Set up my tent on the first day of the year
Exodus,40,3,and put the chest with the Ten Commandments behind the inside curtain of the tent.
Exodus,40,4,Bring in the table and set on it those things that are made for it. Also bring in the lampstand and attach the lamps to it.
Exodus,40,5,Then place the gold altar of incense in front of the sacred chest and hang a curtain at the entrance to the tent.
Exodus,40,6,Set the altar for burning sacrifices in front of the entrance to my tent.
Exodus,40,7,Put the large bronze bowl between the tent and the altar and fill the bowl with water.
Exodus,40,8,Surround the tent and the altar with the wall of curtains and hang the curtain that was made for the entrance.
Exodus,40,9,Use the sacred olive oil to dedicate the tent and everything in it to me.
Exodus,40,10,Do the same thing with the altar for offering sacrifices and its equipment
Exodus,40,11,and with the bowl and its stand.
Exodus,40,12,Bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the tent and make them wash themselves.
Exodus,40,13,"Dress Aaron in the priestly clothes, then use the sacred olive oil to ordain him and dedicate him to me as my priest."
Exodus,40,14,Put the priestly robes on Aaron's sons
Exodus,40,15,"and ordain them in the same way, so they and their descendants will always be my priests."
Exodus,40,16,Moses followed the LORD 's instructions.
Exodus,40,17,"And on the first day of the first month of the second year, the sacred tent was set up."
Exodus,40,18,"The posts, stands, and framework were put in place,"
Exodus,40,19,then the two layers of coverings were hung over them.
Exodus,40,20,"The stones with the Ten Commandments written on them were stored in the sacred chest, the place of mercy was put on top of it, and the carrying poles were attached."
Exodus,40,21,The chest was brought into the tent and set behind the curtain in the most holy place. These things were done exactly as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Exodus,40,22,"The table for the sacred bread was put along the north wall of the holy place,"
Exodus,40,23,after which the bread was set on the table.
Exodus,40,24,"The lampstand was put along the south wall,"
Exodus,40,25,then the lamps were attached to it there in the presence of the LORD.
Exodus,40,26,"The gold incense altar was set up in front of the curtain,"
Exodus,40,27,and sweet-smelling incense was burnt on it. These things were done exactly as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Exodus,40,28,The curtain was hung at the entrance to the sacred tent.
Exodus,40,29,"Then the altar for offering sacrifices was put in front of the tent, and animal sacrifices and gifts of grain were offered there."
Exodus,40,30,"The large bronze bowl was placed between the altar and the entrance to the tent. It was filled with water,"
Exodus,40,31,"then Moses and Aaron, together with Aaron's sons, washed their hands and feet."
Exodus,40,32,"In fact, they washed each time before entering the tent or offering sacrifices at the altar. These things were done exactly as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Exodus,40,33,"Finally, Moses had the curtain hung around the courtyard."
Exodus,40,34,Suddenly the sacred tent was covered by a thick cloud and filled with the glory of the LORD.
Exodus,40,35,"And so, Moses could not enter the tent."
Exodus,40,36,"Whenever the cloud moved from the tent, the people would break camp and follow;"
Exodus,40,37,"then they would set up camp and stay there, until it moved again."
Exodus,40,38,"No matter where the people travelled, the LORD was with them. Each day his cloud was over the tent, and each night a fire could be seen in the cloud."
Leviticus,2,1,"When you offer sacrifices to give thanks to me, you must use only your finest flour. Put it in a dish, sprinkle olive oil and incense on the flour,"
Leviticus,2,2,"and take it to the priests from Aaron's family. One of them will scoop up the incense together with a handful of the flour and oil. Then, to show that the whole offering belongs to me, the priest will lay this part on the bronze altar and send it up in smoke with a smell that pleases me."
Leviticus,2,3,The rest of this sacrifice is for the priests; it is very holy because it was offered to me.
Leviticus,2,4,"If you bake bread in an oven for this sacrifice, use only your finest flour, but without any yeast. You may make the flour into a loaf mixed with olive oil, or you may make it into thin wafers and brush them with oil."
Leviticus,2,5,"If you cook bread in a shallow pan for this sacrifice, use only your finest flour. Mix it with olive oil, but do not use any yeast."
Leviticus,2,6,Then break the bread into small pieces and sprinkle them with oil.
Leviticus,2,7,"If you cook your bread in a pan with a lid on it, you must also use the finest flour mixed with oil."
Leviticus,2,8,"You may prepare sacrifices to give thanks in any of these three ways. Bring your sacrifice to a priest, and he will take it to the bronze altar."
Leviticus,2,9,"Then, to show that the whole offering belongs to me, the priest will lay part of it on the altar and send it up in smoke with a smell that pleases me."
Leviticus,2,10,The rest of this sacrifice is for the priests; it is very holy because it was offered to me.
Leviticus,2,11,"Yeast and honey must never be burnt on the altar, so don't ever mix either of these in a grain sacrifice."
Leviticus,2,12,"You may offer either of them separately, when you present the first part of your harvest to me, but they must never be burnt on the altar."
Leviticus,2,13,"Salt is offered when you make an agreement with me, so sprinkle salt on these sacrifices."
Leviticus,2,14,"Freshly cut grain, either roasted or coarsely ground, must be used when you offer the first part of your grain harvest."
Leviticus,2,15,"You must mix in some olive oil and put incense on top, because this is a grain sacrifice."
Leviticus,2,16,A priest will sprinkle all the incense and some of the grain and oil on the altar and send them up in smoke to show that the whole offering belongs to me.
Leviticus,3,1,"When you offer sacrifices to ask my blessing, you may offer either a bull or a cow, but there must be nothing wrong with the animal."
Leviticus,3,2,"Lead it to the entrance of the sacred tent, lay your hand on its head, and have it killed there. A priest from Aaron's family will splatter its blood against the four sides of the altar."
Leviticus,3,3,"Offer all the fat on the animal's insides,"
Leviticus,3,4,as well as the lower part of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat.
Leviticus,3,5,"Some of the priests will lay these pieces on the altar and send them up in smoke with a smell that pleases me, together with the sacrifice that is offered to please me."
Leviticus,3,6,"Instead of a bull or a cow, you may offer any sheep or goat that has nothing wrong with it."
Leviticus,3,7,"If you offer a sheep, you must present it to me at the entrance to the sacred tent."
Leviticus,3,8,Lay your hand on its head and have it killed there. A priest will then splatter its blood against the four sides of the altar.
Leviticus,3,9,"Offer the fat on the tail, the tailbone, and the insides,"
Leviticus,3,10,as well as the lower part of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat.
Leviticus,3,11,One of the priests will lay these pieces on the altar and send them up in smoke as a food offering for me.
Leviticus,3,12,"If you offer a goat, you must also present it to me"
Leviticus,3,13,at the entrance to the sacred tent. Lay your hand on its head and have it killed there. A priest will then splatter its blood against the four sides of the altar.
Leviticus,3,14,"Offer all the fat on the animal's insides,"
Leviticus,3,15,as well as the lower part of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat.
Leviticus,3,16,One of the priests will put these pieces on the altar and send them up in smoke as a food offering with a smell that pleases me. All fat belongs to me.
Leviticus,3,17,"So you and your descendants must never eat any fat or any blood, not even in the privacy of your own homes. This law will never change."
Leviticus,4,1,The LORD told Moses
Leviticus,4,2,to say to the community of Israel: Offer a sacrifice to ask forgiveness when you sin by accidentally doing something I have told you not to do.
Leviticus,4,3,"When the high priest sins, he makes everyone else guilty too. And so, he must sacrifice a young bull that has nothing wrong with it."
Leviticus,4,4,"The priest will lead the bull to the entrance of the sacred tent, lay his hand on its head, and kill it there."
Leviticus,4,5,"He will take a bowl of the blood inside the tent,"
Leviticus,4,6,"dip a finger in the blood, and sprinkle some of it seven times towards the sacred chest behind the curtain."
Leviticus,4,7,"Then, in my presence, he will smear some of the blood on each of the four corners of the incense altar, before pouring out the rest at the foot of the bronze altar near the entrance to the tent."
Leviticus,5,1,"If you refuse to testify in court about something you saw or know has happened, you have sinned and can be punished."
Leviticus,5,2,"You are guilty and unfit to worship me, if you accidentally touch the dead body of any kind of unclean animal."
Leviticus,5,3,You are guilty if you find out that you have accidentally touched any waste that comes from a human body.
Leviticus,5,4,You are guilty the moment you realize that you have made a hasty promise to do something good or bad.
Leviticus,5,5,"As soon as you discover that you have committed any of these sins, you must confess what you have done."
Leviticus,5,6,"Then you must bring a female sheep or goat to me as the price for your sin. A priest will sacrifice the animal, and you will be forgiven."
Leviticus,5,7,"If you are poor and cannot afford to bring an animal, you may bring two doves or two pigeons. One of these will be a sacrifice to ask my forgiveness, and the other will be a sacrifice to please me."
Leviticus,5,8,"Give both birds to the priest, who will offer one as a sacrifice to ask my forgiveness. He will wring its neck without tearing off its head,"
Leviticus,5,9,"splatter some of its blood on one side of the bronze altar, and drain out the rest at the foot of the altar."
Leviticus,5,10,Then he will follow the proper rules for offering the other bird as a sacrifice to please me. You will be forgiven when the priest offers these sacrifices as the price for your sin.
Leviticus,5,11,"If you are so poor that you cannot afford doves or pigeons, you may bring one kilogramme of your finest flour. This is a sacrifice to ask my forgiveness, so don't sprinkle olive oil or sweet-smelling incense on it."
Leviticus,5,12,"Give the flour to a priest, who will scoop up a handful and send it up in smoke together with the other offerings. This is a reminder that all the flour belongs to me."
Leviticus,5,13,"By offering this sacrifice, the priest pays the price for any of these sins you may have committed. The priest gets the rest of the flour, just as he does with grain sacrifices."
Leviticus,7,1,The sacrifice to make things right is very sacred.
Leviticus,7,2,"The animal must be killed in the same place where the sacrifice to please me is killed, and the animal's blood must be splattered against the four sides of the bronze altar."
Leviticus,7,3,"Offer all the animal's fat, including the fat on its tail and on its insides,"
Leviticus,7,4,as well as the lower part of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat.
Leviticus,7,5,One of the priests will lay these pieces on the altar and send them up in smoke to me.
Leviticus,7,6,"This sacrifice for making things right is very holy. Only the priests may eat it, and they must eat it in a holy place."
Leviticus,7,7,"The ceremony for this sacrifice and the one for sin are alike, and the meat may be eaten only by the priest who performs this ceremony of forgiveness."
Leviticus,7,8,"In fact, the priest who offers a sacrifice to please me may keep the skin of the animal,"
Leviticus,7,9,just as he may eat the bread from a sacrifice to give thanks to me.
Leviticus,7,10,All other grain sacrifices—with or without olive oil in them—are to be divided equally among the priests of Aaron's family.
Leviticus,7,11,Here are the instructions for offering a sacrifice to ask my blessing:
Leviticus,7,12,"If you offer it to give thanks, you must offer some bread together with it. Use the finest flour to make three kinds of bread without yeast—two in the form of loaves mixed with olive oil and one in the form of thin wafers brushed with oil."
Leviticus,7,13,You must also make some bread with yeast.
Leviticus,7,14,"Give me one loaf or wafer from each of these four kinds of bread, after which they will belong to the priest who splattered the blood against the bronze altar."
Leviticus,7,15,"When you offer an animal to ask a blessing from me or to thank me, the meat belongs to you, but it must be eaten the same day."
Leviticus,7,16,"It is different with the sacrifices you offer when you make me a promise or voluntarily give me something. The meat from those sacrifices may be kept and eaten the next day,"
Leviticus,8,1,The LORD said to Moses:
Leviticus,8,2,"Send for Aaron and his sons, as well as their priestly clothes, the oil for ordination, the bull for the sin offering, the two rams, and a basket of bread made without yeast."
Leviticus,8,3,Then bring the whole community of Israel together at the entrance to the sacred tent.
Leviticus,8,4,"Moses obeyed the LORD , and when everyone had come together,"
Leviticus,8,5,"he said, “We are here to follow the LORD 's instructions.”"
Leviticus,8,6,"After Moses told Aaron and his sons to step forward, he made them wash themselves."
Leviticus,8,7,He put the priestly shirt and robe on Aaron and wrapped the sash around his waist. Then he put the sacred apron on Aaron and fastened it with the finely woven belt.
Leviticus,8,8,"Next, he put on Aaron the sacred breastpiece that was used in learning what the LORD wanted his people to do."
Leviticus,8,9,"He placed the turban on Aaron's head, and on the front of the turban was the narrow strip of thin gold as a sign of his dedication to the LORD."
Leviticus,8,10,Moses then dedicated the sacred tent and everything in it to the LORD by sprinkling them with some of the oil for ordination.
Leviticus,8,11,"He sprinkled the bronze altar seven times, and he sprinkled its equipment, as well as the large bronze bowl and its base."
Leviticus,8,12,He also poured some of the oil on Aaron's head to dedicate him to the LORD.
Leviticus,8,13,"At last, Moses dressed Aaron's sons in their shirts, then tied sashes around them and put special caps on them, just as the LORD had commanded."
Leviticus,8,14,"Moses led out the bull that was to be sacrificed for sin, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head."
Leviticus,8,15,"After it was killed, Moses dipped a finger in the blood and smeared some of it on each of the four corners of the bronze altar, before pouring out the rest at the foot of the altar. This purified the altar and made it a fit place for offering the sacrifice for sin."
Leviticus,8,16,"Moses then took the fat on the bull's insides, as well as the lower part of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat, and sent them up in smoke on the altar fire."
Leviticus,8,17,"Finally, he took the skin and the flesh of the bull, together with the food still in its stomach, and burnt them outside the camp, just as the LORD had commanded."
Leviticus,8,18,"Moses led out the ram for the sacrifice to please the LORD. After Aaron and his sons had laid their hands on its head,"
Leviticus,8,19,Moses killed the ram and splattered its blood against the four sides of the altar.
Leviticus,9,1,"Eight days later Moses called together Aaron, his sons, and Israel's leaders."
Leviticus,9,2,Then he said to Aaron: Find a young bull and a ram that have nothing wrong with them. Offer the bull to the LORD as a sacrifice for sin and the ram as a sacrifice to please him.
Leviticus,9,3,"Tell the people of Israel that they must offer sacrifices as well. They must offer a goat as a sacrifice for sin, and a bull and a ram as a sacrifice to please the LORD . The bull and the ram must be a year old and have nothing wrong with them."
Leviticus,9,4,"Then the people must offer a bull and a ram as a sacrifice to ask the LORD 's blessing and also a grain sacrifice mixed with oil. Do this, because the LORD will appear to you today."
Leviticus,9,5,"After the animals and the grain had been brought to the front of the sacred tent, and the people were standing there in the presence of the LORD,"
Leviticus,9,6,"Moses said: The LORD has ordered you to do this, so that he may appear to you in all his glory."
Leviticus,9,7,"Aaron, step up to the altar and offer the sacrifice to please the LORD , then offer the sacrifices for the forgiveness of your sins and for the sins of the people, just as the LORD has commanded."
Leviticus,9,8,Aaron stepped up to the altar and killed the bull that was to be the sacrifice for his sins.
Leviticus,9,9,"His sons brought him the blood. He dipped a finger in it, smeared some on the four corners of the bronze altar, and poured out the rest at its foot."
Leviticus,9,10,"But he sent up in smoke the fat, the kidneys, and the lower part of the liver, just as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Leviticus,9,11,Then Aaron burnt the skin and the flesh outside the camp.
Leviticus,9,12,"After Aaron had killed the ram that was sacrificed to please the LORD , Aaron's sons brought him the blood, and he splattered it against all four sides of the altar."
Leviticus,9,13,"They brought him each piece of the animal, including the head, and he burnt them all on the altar."
Leviticus,9,14,He washed the insides and the hind legs and also sent them up in smoke.
Leviticus,9,15,"Next, Aaron sacrificed the goat for the sins of the people, as he had done with the sacrifice for his own sins."
Leviticus,9,16,"And so, he burnt this sacrifice on the altar in the proper way."
Leviticus,9,17,He also presented the grain sacrifice and burnt a handful of the flour on the altar as part of the morning sacrifice.
Leviticus,9,18,"At last, he killed the bull and the ram as a sacrifice to ask the LORD 's blessing on the people. Aaron's sons brought him the blood, and he splattered it against the four sides of the altar."
Leviticus,9,19,"His sons placed all the fat, as well as the kidneys and the lower part of the liver"
Leviticus,9,20,on top of the choice ribs.
Leviticus,9,21,Then Aaron burnt the fat on the altar and lifted up the ribs and the right hind leg to show that these were dedicated to the LORD . This was done just as the LORD had instructed Moses.
Leviticus,9,22,"Aaron held out his hand and gave the people his blessing, before coming down from the bronze altar where he had offered the sacrifices."
Leviticus,9,23,"He and Moses went into the sacred tent, and when they came out, they gave the people their blessing. Then the LORD appeared to the people in all his glory."
Leviticus,9,24,"The LORD sent fiery flames that burnt up everything on the altar, and when everyone saw this, they shouted and fell to their knees to worship the LORD."
Leviticus,10,1,"Nadab and Abihu were two of Aaron's sons, but they disobeyed the LORD by burning incense to him on a fire pan, when they were not supposed to."
Leviticus,10,2,Suddenly the LORD sent fiery flames and burnt them to death.
Leviticus,10,3,"Then Moses told Aaron that this was exactly what the LORD had meant when he said: “I demand respect from my priests, and I will be praised by everyone!” Aaron was speechless."
Leviticus,10,4,"Moses sent for Mishael and Elzaphan, the two sons of Aaron's uncle Uzziel. Then he told them, “Take these two dead relatives of yours outside the camp far from the entrance to the sacred tent.”"
Leviticus,10,5,So they dragged the dead men away by their clothes.
Leviticus,10,6,"Then Moses told Aaron and his other two sons, Eleazar and Ithamar: Don't show your sorrow by leaving your hair uncombed and tearing your priestly clothes, or the LORD will get angry. He will kill the three of you and punish everyone else. It's all right for your relatives, the people of Israel, to mourn for those he destroyed by fire."
Leviticus,10,7,"But you are the LORD 's chosen priests, and you must not leave the sacred tent, or you will die. Aaron and his two sons obeyed Moses."
Leviticus,10,8,The LORD said to Aaron:
Leviticus,10,9,"When you or your sons enter the sacred tent, you must never drink beer or wine. If you do, you will die there! This law will never change."
Leviticus,10,10,You must learn the difference between what is holy and what isn't holy and between the clean and the unclean.
Leviticus,10,11,You must also teach the people of Israel everything that I commanded Moses to say to them.
Leviticus,10,12,"Moses told Aaron and his two sons, Eleazar and Ithamar: The grain sacrifice that was offered to give thanks to the LORD is very holy. So make bread without yeast from the part that wasn't sent up in smoke and eat it beside the altar."
Leviticus,10,13,"The LORD has said that this belongs to you and your sons, and that it must be eaten in a holy place."
Leviticus,11,1,The LORD told Moses and Aaron
Leviticus,11,2,to say to the community of Israel: You may eat
Leviticus,11,3,any animal that has divided hoofs and chews the cud.
Leviticus,12,1,The LORD told Moses
Leviticus,12,2,"to say to the community of Israel: If a woman gives birth to a son, she is unclean for seven days, just as she is during her monthly period."
Leviticus,12,3,"Her son must be circumcised on the eighth day,"
Leviticus,12,4,but her loss of blood keeps her from being completely clean for another thirty-three days. During this time she must not touch anything holy or go to the place of worship.
Leviticus,12,5,"Any woman who gives birth to a daughter is unclean for two weeks, just as she is during her period. And she won't be completely clean for another sixty-six days."
Leviticus,12,6,"When the mother has completed her time of cleansing, she must come to the front of the sacred tent and bring to the priest a year-old lamb as a sacrifice to please me and a dove or a pigeon as a sacrifice for sin."
Leviticus,12,7,"After the priest offers the sacrifices to me, the mother will become completely clean from her loss of blood, whether her child is a boy or a girl."
Leviticus,12,8,"If she cannot afford a lamb, she can offer two doves or two pigeons, one as a sacrifice to please me and the other as a sacrifice for sin."
Leviticus,13,1,The LORD told Moses and Aaron to say to the people:
Leviticus,13,2,"If sores or boils or a skin rash should break out and start spreading on your body, you must be brought to Aaron or to one of the other priests."
Leviticus,13,3,"If the priest discovers that the hair in the infected area has turned white and that the infection seems more than skin deep, he will say, “This is leprosy —you are unclean.”"
Leviticus,13,4,"But if the infected area is white and only skin deep, and if the hair in it hasn't turned white, the priest will order you to stay away from everyone else for seven days."
Leviticus,13,5,"If the disease hasn't spread by that time, he will order you to stay away from everyone else for another seven days."
Leviticus,13,6,"Then if the disease hasn't got any worse or spread, the priest will say, “You are clean. It was only a sore. After you wash your clothes, you may go home.”"
Leviticus,13,7,"However, if the disease comes back, you must return to the priest."
Leviticus,13,8,"If it is discovered that the disease has started spreading, he will say, “This is leprosy—you are unclean.”"
Leviticus,13,9,Any of you with a skin disease must be brought to a priest.
Leviticus,13,10,"If he discovers that the sore spot is white with pus and that the hair around it has also turned white,"
Leviticus,13,11,"he will say, “This is leprosy. You are unclean and must stay away from everyone else.”"
Leviticus,14,1,The LORD told Moses to say to the people:
Leviticus,15,1,The LORD told Moses and Aaron
Leviticus,15,2,"to say to the community of Israel: Any man with an infected penis is unclean,"
Leviticus,15,3,whether it is stopped up or keeps dripping.
Leviticus,15,4,"Anything that he rests on or sits on is also unclean,"
Leviticus,17,1,The LORD told Moses
Leviticus,17,2,"to tell Aaron, his sons, and everyone else in Israel:"
Leviticus,18,1,The LORD told Moses
Leviticus,18,2,to tell the people of Israel: I am the LORD your God!
Leviticus,18,3,So don't follow the customs of Egypt where you used to live or those of Canaan where I am bringing you.
Leviticus,18,4,"I am the LORD your God, and you must obey my teachings."
Leviticus,18,5,Obey them and you will live. I am the LORD.
Leviticus,18,6,"Don't have sex with any of your close relatives,"
Leviticus,18,7,especially your own mother. This would disgrace your father.
Leviticus,18,8,And don't disgrace him by having sex with any of his other wives.
Leviticus,18,9,"Don't have sex with your sister or stepsister, whether you grew up together or not."
Leviticus,18,10,Don't disgrace yourself by having sex with your granddaughter
Leviticus,18,11,or half-sister
Leviticus,19,1,The LORD told Moses
Leviticus,19,2,"to say to the community of Israel: I am the LORD your God. I am holy, and you must be holy too!"
Leviticus,20,1,The LORD told Moses
Leviticus,20,2,to say to the community of Israel: Death by stoning is the penalty for any citizens or foreigners in the country who sacrifice their children to the god Molech.
Leviticus,20,3,"They have disgraced both the place where I am worshipped and my holy name, and so I will turn against them and no longer let them belong to my people."
Leviticus,20,4,"Some of you may let them get away with human sacrifice,"
Leviticus,20,5,"but not me. If any of you worship Molech, I will turn against you and your entire family, and I will no longer let you belong to my people."
Leviticus,20,6,"I will be your enemy if you go to someone who claims to speak with the dead, and I will destroy you from among my people."
Leviticus,20,7,Dedicate yourselves to me and be holy because I am the LORD your God.
Leviticus,20,8,"I have chosen you as my people, and I expect you to obey my laws."
Leviticus,20,9,"If you curse your father or mother, you will be put to death, and it will be your own fault."
Leviticus,20,10,"If any of you men have sex with another man's wife, both you and the woman will be put to death."
Leviticus,20,11,"Having sex with one of your father's wives disgraces him. So both you and the woman will be put to death, just as you deserve."
Leviticus,20,12,"It isn't natural to have sex with your daughter-in-law, and both of you will be put to death, just as you deserve."
Leviticus,20,13,"It's disgusting for men to have sex with one another, and those who do will be put to death, just as they deserve."
Leviticus,20,14,"It isn't natural for a man to marry both a mother and her daughter, and so all three of them will be burnt to death."
Leviticus,21,1,"The LORD gave Moses these instructions for Aaron's sons, the priests: Touching a dead body will make you unclean. So don't go near a dead relative,"
Leviticus,21,2,"except your mother, father, son, daughter, brother,"
Leviticus,21,3,"or an unmarried sister, who has no husband to take care of her."
Leviticus,21,4,Don't make yourself unclean by attending the funeral of someone related to you by marriage.
Leviticus,21,5,Don't shave any part of your head or trim your beard or cut yourself to show that you are mourning.
Leviticus,21,6,"I am the LORD your God, and I have chosen you alone to offer sacrifices of food to me on the altar. That's why you must keep yourselves holy."
Leviticus,21,7,"Don't marry a divorced woman or a woman who has served as a temple prostitute. You are holy,"
Leviticus,21,8,"because I am holy. And so, you must be treated with proper respect, since you offer food sacrifices to me, the God of holiness."
Leviticus,21,9,"If any of you priests has a daughter who disgraces you by serving as a temple prostitute, she must be burnt to death."
Leviticus,21,10,"If you are the high priest, you must not leave your hair uncombed or tear your clothes in order to mourn for the dead."
Leviticus,21,11,"Don't make yourself unclean by going near a dead body, not even that of your own father or mother."
Leviticus,21,12,"If you leave the sacred place to attend a funeral, both you and the sacred place become unclean, because you are the high priest."
Leviticus,21,13,"If you are the high priest, you must marry only a virgin"
Leviticus,21,14,"from your own tribe. Don't marry a divorced woman or any other woman who has already had sex, including a temple prostitute."
Leviticus,21,15,"In this way, your descendants will be qualified to serve me. Remember—I am the LORD , and I have chosen you."
Leviticus,21,16,The LORD told Moses
Leviticus,22,1,The LORD told Moses
Leviticus,22,2,"to say to Aaron and his sons: I am the LORD God, and I demand that you honour my holy name by showing proper respect for the offerings brought to me by the people of Israel."
Leviticus,22,3,"If any of you are unclean when you accept an offering for me, I will no longer let you serve as a priest."
Leviticus,22,4,"None of you may take part in the sacred meals while you have a skin disease or an infected penis, or after you have been near a dead body or have had a flow of semen,"
Leviticus,22,5,"or if you have touched an unclean creature of any sort, including an unclean person."
Leviticus,23,1,The LORD told Moses
Leviticus,23,2,to say to the community of Israel: I have chosen certain times for you to come together and worship me.
Leviticus,23,3,"You have six days when you can do your work, but the seventh day of each week is holy because it belongs to me. No matter where you live, you must rest on the Sabbath and come together for worship. This law will never change."
Leviticus,24,1,The LORD told Moses
Leviticus,24,2,"to say to the community of Israel: You must supply the purest olive oil for the lamps in the sacred tent, so they will keep burning."
Leviticus,25,1,"When Moses was on Mount Sinai, the LORD told him"
Leviticus,25,2,"to say to the community of Israel: After you enter the land that I am giving you, it must be allowed to rest one year out of every seven."
Leviticus,25,3,"You may raise grain and grapes for six years,"
Leviticus,25,4,"but the seventh year you must let your fields and vineyards rest in honour of me, your LORD."
Leviticus,25,5,"This is to be a time of complete rest for your fields and vineyards, so don't harvest anything they produce."
Leviticus,26,1,I am the LORD your God! So don't make or worship any sort of idols or images.
Leviticus,26,2,"Respect the Sabbath and honour the place where I am worshipped, because I am the LORD."
Leviticus,26,3,"Faithfully obey my laws,"
Leviticus,26,4,and I will send rain to make your crops grow and your trees produce fruit.
Leviticus,26,5,"Your harvest of grain and grapes will be so abundant, that you won't know what to do with it all. You will eat and be satisfied, and you will live in safety."
Leviticus,26,6,"I will bless your country with peace, and you will rest without fear. I will wipe out the dangerous animals and protect you from enemy attacks."
Leviticus,26,7,"You will chase and destroy your enemies,"
Leviticus,26,8,"even if there are only five of you and a hundred of them, or only a hundred of you and ten thousand of them."
Leviticus,26,9,"I will treat you with such kindness that your nation will grow strong, and I will also keep my promises to you."
Leviticus,26,10,Your barns will overflow with grain each year.
Leviticus,26,11,I will live among you and never again look on you with disgust.
Leviticus,26,12,"I will walk with you—I will be your God, and you will be my people."
Leviticus,26,13,"I am the LORD your God, and I rescued you from Egypt, so that you would never again be slaves. I have set you free; now walk with your heads held high."
Leviticus,27,1,The LORD told Moses
Leviticus,27,2,"to say to the community of Israel: If you ever want to free someone who has been promised to me,"
Numbers,1,1,"The people of Israel had left Egypt and were living in the Sinai Desert. Then on the first day of the second month of the second year, Moses was in the sacred tent when the LORD said:"
Numbers,2,1,The LORD told Moses and Aaron
Numbers,2,2,"how the Israelites should arrange their camp: Each tribe must set up camp under its own banner and under the flags of its ancestral families. These camps will be arranged around the sacred tent, but not close to it."
Numbers,3,1,"When the LORD talked with Moses on Mount Sinai,"
Numbers,3,2,"Aaron's four sons, Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar,"
Numbers,3,3,were the ones to be ordained as priests.
Numbers,3,4,"But the LORD killed Nadab and Abihu in the Sinai Desert when they used fire that was unacceptable in their offering to the LORD. And because Nadab and Abihu had no sons, only Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests with their father Aaron."
Numbers,3,5,The LORD said to Moses:
Numbers,3,6,Assign the Levi tribe to Aaron the priest. They will be his assistants
Numbers,3,7,and will work at the sacred tent for him and for all the Israelites.
Numbers,3,8,The Levites will serve the community by being responsible for the furnishings of the tent.
Numbers,3,9,"They are assigned to help Aaron and his sons,"
Numbers,3,10,who have been appointed to be priests. Anyone else who tries to perform the duties of a priest must be put to death.
Numbers,4,1,The LORD told Moses and Aaron:
Numbers,5,1,The LORD told Moses
Numbers,6,1,The LORD told Moses
Numbers,6,2,"to say to the people of Israel: If any of you want to dedicate yourself to me by vowing to become a Nazirite,"
Numbers,6,3,you must no longer drink any wine or beer or use any kind of vinegar. Don't drink grape juice or eat grapes or raisins—
Numbers,6,4,not even the seeds or skins.
Numbers,6,5,"Even the hair of a Nazirite is sacred to me, and as long as you are a Nazirite, you must never cut your hair."
Numbers,6,6,"During the time that you are a Nazirite, you must never go close to a dead body,"
Numbers,7,1,"When Moses had finished setting up the sacred tent, he dedicated it to the LORD , together with its furnishings, the altar, and its equipment."
Numbers,7,2,"Then the twelve tribal leaders of Israel, the same men who had been in charge of counting the people, came to the tent"
Numbers,7,3,with gifts for the LORD . They brought six strong carts and twelve oxen—one ox from each leader and a cart from every two.
Numbers,7,4,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,7,5,"“Accept these gifts, so the Levites can use them here at the sacred tent for carrying the sacred things.”"
Numbers,7,6,"Then Moses took the carts and oxen and gave them to the Levites,"
Numbers,8,1,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,8,2,“Tell Aaron to put the seven lamps on the lampstand so they shine towards the front.”
Numbers,8,3,Aaron obeyed and placed the lamps as he was told.
Numbers,8,4,"The lampstand was made of hammered gold from its base to the decorative flowers on top, exactly like the pattern the LORD had described to Moses."
Numbers,8,5,The LORD said to Moses:
Numbers,8,6,The Levites must be acceptable to me before they begin working at the sacred tent. So separate them from the rest of the Israelites
Numbers,8,7,and sprinkle them with the water that washes away their sins. Then tell them to shave their entire bodies and wash their clothes.
Numbers,8,8,They are to bring a bull and its proper grain sacrifice of flour mixed with olive oil. And they must bring a second bull as a sacrifice for sin.
Numbers,8,9,"Then you, Moses, will call together all the people of Israel and make the Levites go to my sacred tent,"
Numbers,8,10,where the people will place their hands on them.
Numbers,8,11,"Aaron will present the Levites to me as a gift from the people, so that the Levites will do my work."
Numbers,8,12,"After this, the Levites are to place their hands on the heads of the bulls. Then one of the bulls will be sacrificed for the forgiveness of sin, and the other to make sure that I am pleased."
Numbers,8,13,"The Levites will stand at my altar in front of Aaron and his sons, who will then dedicate the Levites to me."
Numbers,8,14,This ceremony will show that the Levites are different from the other Israelites and belong to me in a special way.
Numbers,8,15,"After they have been made acceptable and have been dedicated, they will be allowed to work at my sacred tent."
Numbers,8,16,They are mine and will take the place of the firstborn Israelite sons.
Numbers,8,17,"When I killed the eldest sons of the Egyptians, I decided that the firstborn sons in each Israelite family would be mine, as well as every firstborn male from their flocks and herds."
Numbers,8,18,"But now I have chosen these Levites as substitutes for the firstborn sons,"
Numbers,8,19,and I have given them as gifts to Aaron and his sons to serve at the sacred tent. I will hold them responsible for what happens to anyone who gets too close to the sacred tent.
Numbers,8,20,"Moses, Aaron, and the other Israelites made sure that the Levites did everything the LORD had commanded."
Numbers,8,21,The Levites sprinkled themselves with the water of forgiveness and washed their clothes. Then Aaron brought them to the altar and offered sacrifices to forgive their sins and make them acceptable to the LORD.
Numbers,8,22,"After this, the Levites worked at the sacred tent as assistants to Aaron and his sons, just as the LORD had commanded."
Numbers,8,23,"The LORD also told Moses,"
Numbers,9,1,"During the first month of Israel's second year in the Sinai Desert, the LORD had told Moses"
Numbers,9,2,"to say to the people, “Celebrate Passover"
Numbers,9,3,in the evening of the fourteenth day of this month and do it by following all the regulations.”
Numbers,10,1,The LORD told Moses:
Numbers,10,2,Have two trumpets made out of hammered silver. These will be used to call the people together and to give the signal for moving your camp.
Numbers,10,3,"If both trumpets are blown, everyone is to meet with you at the entrance to the sacred tent."
Numbers,10,4,"But if just one is blown, only the twelve tribal leaders need to come together."
Numbers,11,1,One day the Israelites started complaining about their troubles. The LORD heard them and became so angry that he destroyed the outer edges of their camp with fire.
Numbers,11,2,"When the people begged Moses to help, he prayed, and the fire went out."
Numbers,11,3,"They named the place “Burning”, because in his anger the LORD had set their camp on fire."
Numbers,11,4,"One day some worthless foreigners among the Israelites became greedy for food, and even the Israelites themselves began moaning, “We don't have any meat!"
Numbers,11,5,"In Egypt we could eat all the fish we wanted, and there were cucumbers, melons, onions, and garlic."
Numbers,11,6,"But we're starving out here, and the only food we have is this manna.”"
Numbers,11,7,The manna was like small whitish seeds
Numbers,13,1,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,13,2,“Choose a leader from each tribe and send them into Canaan to explore the land I am giving you.”
Numbers,13,3,So Moses sent twelve tribal leaders from Israel's camp in the Paran Desert
Numbers,14,1,"After the Israelites heard the report from the twelve men who had explored Canaan, the people cried all night"
Numbers,14,2,"and complained to Moses and Aaron, “We wish we had died in Egypt or somewhere out here in the desert!"
Numbers,14,3,"Is the LORD leading us into Canaan, just to have us killed and our women and children captured? We'd be better off in Egypt.”"
Numbers,14,4,"Then they said to one another, “Let's choose our own leader and go back.”"
Numbers,14,5,Moses and Aaron bowed down to pray in front of the crowd.
Numbers,14,6,Joshua and Caleb tore their clothes in sorrow
Numbers,14,7,"and said: We saw the land ourselves, and it's very good."
Numbers,14,8,"If we obey the LORD , he will surely give us that land rich with milk and honey."
Numbers,14,9,"So don't rebel. We have no reason to be afraid of the people who live there. The LORD is on our side, and they won't stand a chance against us!"
Numbers,14,10,"The crowd threatened to stone Moses and Aaron to death. But just then, the LORD appeared in a cloud at the sacred tent."
Numbers,14,11,"The LORD said to Moses, “I have done great things for these people, and they still reject me by refusing to believe in my power."
Numbers,14,12,"So they will no longer be my people. I will destroy them, but I will make you the ancestor of a nation even stronger than theirs.”"
Numbers,15,1,The LORD told Moses
Numbers,15,2,to give the Israelites the following laws about offering sacrifices:
Numbers,15,3,"Bulls or rams or goats are the animals that you may burn on the altar as sacrifices to please me. You may also offer sacrifices voluntarily or because you made a promise, or because they are part of your regular religious ceremonies. The smell of the smoke from these sacrifices is pleasing to me."
Numbers,17,1,The LORD told Moses:
Numbers,18,1,"The LORD said to Aaron: You, your sons, and the other Levites of the Kohath clan, are responsible for what happens at the sacred tent. And you and your sons will be responsible for what the priests do."
Numbers,18,2,The Levites are your relatives and are here to help you in your service at the tent.
Numbers,18,3,"You must see that they perform their duties. But if they go near any of the sacred objects or the altar, all of you will die."
Numbers,18,4,No one else is allowed to take care of the sacred tent or to do anything connected with it.
Numbers,18,5,"Follow these instructions, so I won't become angry and punish the Israelites ever again."
Numbers,18,6,"I alone chose the Levites from all the other tribes to belong to me, and I have given them to you as your helpers."
Numbers,18,7,"But only you and your sons can serve as priests at the altar and in the most holy place. Your work as priests is a gift from me, and anyone else who tries to do that work must be put to death."
Numbers,20,1,The people of Israel arrived at the Zin Desert during the first month and set up camp near the town of Kadesh. It was there that Miriam died and was buried.
Numbers,20,2,"The Israelites had no water, so they went to Moses and Aaron"
Numbers,20,3,"and complained, “Moses, we'd be better off if we had died along with the others in front of the LORD 's sacred tent."
Numbers,20,4,"You brought us into this desert, and now we and our livestock are going to die!"
Numbers,20,5,Egypt was better than this horrible place. At least there we had grain and figs and grapevines and pomegranates. But now we don't even have any water.”
Numbers,20,6,"Moses and Aaron went to the entrance to the sacred tent, where they bowed down. The LORD appeared to them in all his glory"
Numbers,21,1,"The Canaanite king of Arad lived in the Southern Desert of Canaan, and when he heard that the Israelites were on their way to the village of Atharim, he attacked and took some of them hostage."
Numbers,21,2,"The Israelites prayed, “Our LORD , if you will help us defeat these Canaanites, we will completely destroy their towns and everything in them, to show that they belong to you.”"
Numbers,21,3,"The LORD answered their prayer and helped them wipe out the Canaanite army and completely destroy their towns. That's why one of the towns is named Hormah, which means “Destroyed Place”."
Numbers,21,4,"The Israelites had to go around the territory of Edom, so when they left Mount Hor, they headed south towards the Red Sea. But along the way, the people became so impatient"
Numbers,21,5,"that they complained against God and said to Moses, “Did you bring us out of Egypt, just to let us die in the desert? There's no water out here, and we can't stand this awful food!”"
Numbers,21,6,Then the LORD sent poisonous snakes that bit and killed many of them.
Numbers,21,7,"Some of the people went to Moses and admitted, “It was wrong of us to insult you and the LORD . Now please ask him to make these snakes go away.” Moses prayed,"
Numbers,21,8,"and the LORD answered, “Make a snake out of bronze and place it on top of a pole. Anyone who gets bitten can look at the snake and won't die.”"
Numbers,21,9,"Moses obeyed the LORD . And all of those who looked at the bronze snake lived, even though they had been bitten by the poisonous snakes."
Numbers,21,10,"As the Israelites continued their journey to Canaan, they camped at Oboth,"
Numbers,21,11,"then at Iye-Abarim in the desert east of Moab,"
Numbers,21,12,and then in the Zered Gorge.
Numbers,21,13,"After that, they crossed the gorge of the River Arnon and camped in the Moabite desert bordering Amorite territory. The Arnon was the border between the Moabites and the Amorites."
Numbers,21,14,"A song in The Book of the LORD 's Battles mentions the town of Waheb with its creeks in the territory of Suphah. It also mentions the River Arnon,"
Numbers,21,15,with its valleys that lie beside the Moabite border and extend to the town of Ar.
Numbers,21,16,"From the Arnon, the Israelites went to the well near the town of Beer, where the LORD had said to Moses, “Call the people together, and I will give them water to drink.”"
Numbers,21,17,That's also the same well the Israelites sang about in this song: Let's celebrate! The well has given us water.
Numbers,21,18,"With their royal sceptres, our leaders pointed out where to dig the well. The Israelites left the desert and camped near the town of Mattanah,"
Numbers,21,19,"then at Nahaliel, and then at Bamoth."
Numbers,21,20,"Finally, they reached Moabite territory, where they camped near Mount Pisgah in a valley overlooking the desert north of the Dead Sea."
Numbers,21,21,The Israelites sent this message to King Sihon of the Amorites:
Numbers,21,22,"Please let us pass through your territory. We promise to stay away from your fields and vineyards, and we won't drink any water from your wells. As long as we're in your land, we won't get off the main road."
Numbers,21,23,"But Sihon refused to let Israel travel through his land. Instead, he called together his entire army and marched into the desert to attack Israel near the town of Jahaz."
Numbers,21,24,"Israel defeated them and took over the Amorite territory from the gorge of the River Arnon in the south to the gorge of the River Jabbok in the north. Beyond the Jabbok was the territory of the Ammonites, who were much stronger than Israel."
Numbers,21,25,"The Israelites settled in the Amorite towns, including the capital city of Heshbon with its surrounding villages."
Numbers,21,26,"King Sihon had ruled from Heshbon, after defeating the Moabites and taking over their land north of the Arnon gorge."
Numbers,21,27,"That's why the Amorites had written this poem about Heshbon: Come and rebuild Heshbon, King Sihon's capital city!"
Numbers,21,28,"His armies marched out like fiery flames, burning down the town of Ar and destroying the hills along the River Arnon."
Numbers,21,29,"You Moabites are done for! Your god Chemosh deserted your people; they were captured, taken away by King Sihon the Amorite."
Numbers,21,30,"We completely defeated Moab. The towns of Heshbon and Dibon, of Nophah and Medeba are ruined and gone."
Numbers,21,31,"After the Israelites had settled in the Amorite territory,"
Numbers,21,32,"Moses sent some men to explore the town of Jazer. Later, the Israelites captured the villages surrounding it and forced out the Amorites who lived there."
Numbers,21,33,"The Israelites headed towards the region of Bashan, where King Og ruled, and he led his entire army to Edrei to meet Israel in battle."
Numbers,21,34,"The LORD said to Moses, “Don't be afraid of Og. I will help you defeat him and his army, just as you did King Sihon who ruled in Heshbon. Og's territory will be yours.”"
Numbers,21,35,"So the Israelites wiped out Og, his family, and his entire army—there were no survivors. Then Israel took over the land of Bashan."
Numbers,22,1,"Israel moved from there to the hills of Moab, where they camped across the River Jordan from the town of Jericho."
Numbers,23,1,"Balaam said to Balak, “Build seven altars here, then bring seven bulls and seven rams.”"
Numbers,23,2,"After Balak had done this, they sacrificed a bull and a ram on each altar."
Numbers,23,3,"Then Balaam said, “Wait here beside your offerings, and I'll go somewhere to be alone. Perhaps the LORD will appear to me. If he does, I will tell you everything he says.” And he left."
Numbers,23,4,"When God appeared to him, Balaam said, “I have built seven altars and have sacrificed a bull and a ram on each one.”"
Numbers,23,5,"The LORD gave Balaam a message, then sent him back to tell Balak."
Numbers,23,6,"When Balaam returned, he found Balak and his officials standing beside the offerings."
Numbers,23,7,Balaam said: “King Balak of Moab brought me from the hills of Syria to curse Israel and announce its doom.
Numbers,23,8,But I can't go against God! He did not curse or condemn Israel.
Numbers,23,9,"“From the mountain peaks, I look down and see Israel, the obedient people of God."
Numbers,23,10,"They are living alone in peace. And though they are many, they don't bother the other nations. “I hope to obey God for as long as I live and to die in such peace.”"
Numbers,23,11,"Balak said, “What are you doing? I asked you to come and place a curse on my enemies. But you have blessed them instead!”"
Numbers,23,12,"Balaam answered, “I can say only what the LORD tells me.”"
Numbers,23,13,"Balak said to Balaam, “Let's go somewhere else. Perhaps if you see a smaller part of the Israelites, you will be able to curse them for me.”"
Numbers,23,14,So he took Balaam to a field on top of Mount Pisgah where lookouts were stationed. Then he built seven altars there and sacrificed a bull and a ram on each one.
Numbers,23,15,"“Wait here beside your offerings,” Balaam said. “The LORD will appear to me over there.”"
Numbers,23,16,"The LORD appeared to Balaam and gave him another message, then he told him to go and tell Balak."
Numbers,23,17,"Balaam went back and saw him and his officials standing beside the offerings. Balak asked, “What did the LORD say?”"
Numbers,23,18,Balaam answered: “Pay close attention to my words—
Numbers,23,19,God is no mere human! He doesn't tell lies or change his mind. God always keeps his promises.
Numbers,23,20,"“My command from God was to bless these people, and there's nothing I can do to change what he has done."
Numbers,23,21,Israel's king is the LORD God. He lives there with them and intends them no harm.
Numbers,23,22,"With the strength of a wild ox, God led Israel out of Egypt."
Numbers,23,23,No magic charms can work against them— just look what God has done for his people.
Numbers,23,24,They are like angry lions ready to attack; and they won't rest until their victim is gobbled up.”
Numbers,23,25,"Balak shouted, “If you're not going to curse Israel, then at least don't bless them.”"
Numbers,23,26,"“I've already told you,” Balaam answered. “I will say only what the LORD tells me.”"
Numbers,23,27,"Balak said to Balaam, “Come on, let's try another place. Perhaps God will let you curse Israel from there.”"
Numbers,23,28,So he took Balaam to Mount Peor overlooking the desert north of the Dead Sea.
Numbers,23,29,"Balaam said, “Build seven altars here, then bring me seven bulls and seven rams.”"
Numbers,23,30,"After Balak had done what Balaam asked, he sacrificed a bull and a ram on each altar."
Numbers,24,1,"Balaam was sure that the LORD would tell him to bless Israel again. So he did not use any magic to find out what the LORD wanted him to do, as he had the first two times. Instead, he looked out towards the desert"
Numbers,24,2,"and saw the tribes of Israel camped below. Just then, God's Spirit took control of him,"
Numbers,24,3,"and Balaam said: “I am the son of Beor, and my words are true, so listen to my message!"
Numbers,24,4,"It comes from the LORD, the God All-Powerful. I bowed down to him and saw a vision of Israel."
Numbers,24,5,"“People of Israel, your camp is lovely."
Numbers,24,6,"It's like a grove of palm trees or a garden beside a river. You are like tall aloe trees that the LORD has planted, or like cedars growing near water."
Numbers,24,7,You and your descendants will prosper like an orchard beside a stream. Your king will rule with power and be a greater king than Agag the Amalekite.
Numbers,24,8,"With the strength of a wild ox, God led you out of Egypt. You will defeat your enemies, shooting them with arrows and crushing their bones."
Numbers,24,9,"Like a lion you lie down, resting after an attack. Who would dare disturb you? “Anyone who blesses you will be blessed; anyone who curses you will be cursed.”"
Numbers,24,10,"When Balak heard this, he was so furious that he pounded his fist against his hand and said, “I called you here to place a curse on my enemies, and you've blessed them three times."
Numbers,24,11,"Leave now and go home! I told you I would pay you well, but since the LORD didn't let you do what I asked, you won't be paid.”"
Numbers,24,12,"Balaam answered, “I told your messengers"
Numbers,24,13,"that even if you offered me a palace full of silver or gold, I would still obey the LORD . And I explained that I would say only what he told me."
Numbers,24,14,"So I'm going back home, but I'm leaving you with a warning about what the Israelites will some day do to your nation.”"
Numbers,24,15,"Balaam said: “I am the son of Beor, and my words are true, so listen to my message!"
Numbers,24,16,"My knowledge comes from God Most High, the LORD All-Powerful. I bowed down to him and saw a vision of Israel."
Numbers,24,17,"“What I saw in my vision hasn't happened yet. But some day, a king of Israel will appear like a star. He will wipe out you Moabites and destroy those tribes who live in the desert."
Numbers,24,18,Israel will conquer Edom and capture the land of that enemy nation.
Numbers,24,19,The king of Israel will rule and destroy the survivors of every town there.
Numbers,24,20,"“And I saw this vision about the Amalekites: Their nation is now great, but it will some day disappear for ever."
Numbers,24,21,"“And this is what I saw about the Kenites: They think they're safe, living among the rocks,"
Numbers,24,22,but they will be wiped out when Assyria conquers them.
Numbers,24,23,“No one can survive if God plans destruction.
Numbers,24,24,"Ships will come from Cyprus, bringing people who will invade the lands of Assyria and Eber. But finally, Cyprus itself will be ruined.”"
Numbers,24,25,"After Balaam finished, he started home, and Balak also left."
Numbers,25,1,"While the Israelites were camped at Acacia, some of the men had sex with Moabite women."
Numbers,25,2,These women then invited the men to ceremonies where sacrifices were offered to their gods. The men ate the meat from the sacrifices and worshipped the Moabite gods.
Numbers,25,3,The LORD was angry with Israel because they had worshipped the god Baal-Peor.
Numbers,25,4,"So he said to Moses, “Take the Israelite leaders who are responsible for this and have them killed in front of my sacred tent where everyone can see. Perhaps then I will stop being angry with the Israelites.”"
Numbers,25,5,"Moses told Israel's officials, “Each of you must put to death any of your men who worshipped Baal.”"
Numbers,25,6,"Later, Moses and the people were at the sacred tent, crying, when one of the Israelite men brought a Midianite woman to meet his family."
Numbers,25,7,"Phinehas, the grandson of Aaron the priest, saw the couple and left the crowd. He found a spear"
Numbers,25,8,"and followed the man into his tent, where he ran the spear through the man and into the woman's stomach. The LORD immediately stopped punishing Israel with a deadly disease,"
Numbers,25,9,but twenty-four thousand Israelites had already died.
Numbers,25,10,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,25,11,"“In my anger, I would have wiped out the Israelites if Phinehas had not been faithful to me."
Numbers,26,1,"After the LORD had stopped the deadly disease from killing the Israelites, he said to Moses and Eleazar son of Aaron,"
Numbers,26,2,“I want you to find out how many Israelites are in each family. And list every man twenty years and older who is able to serve in Israel's army.”
Numbers,26,3,Israel was now camped in the hills of Moab across the River Jordan from the town of Jericho. Moses and Eleazar told them
Numbers,26,4,"what the LORD had said about counting the men twenty years and older, just as Moses and their ancestors had done when they left Egypt."
Numbers,27,1,"Zelophehad was from the Manasseh tribe, and he had five daughters, whose names were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah."
Numbers,27,2,"One day his daughters went to the sacred tent, where they met with Moses, Eleazar, and some other leaders of Israel, as well as a large crowd of Israelites. The young women said:"
Numbers,27,3,"You know that our father died in the desert. But it was for something he did wrong, not for joining with Korah in rebelling against the LORD. Our father left no sons"
Numbers,27,4,"to carry on his family name. But why should his name die out for that reason? Give us some land like the rest of his relatives in our clan, so our father's name can live on."
Numbers,27,5,"Moses asked the LORD what should be done,"
Numbers,27,6,and the LORD answered:
Numbers,27,7,Zelophehad's daughters are right. They should each be given part of the land their father would have received.
Numbers,27,8,"Tell the Israelites that when a man dies without a son, his daughter will inherit his land."
Numbers,27,9,"If he has no daughter, his brothers will inherit the land."
Numbers,27,10,"But if he has no brothers, his father's brothers will inherit the land."
Numbers,27,11,"And if his father has no brothers, the land must be given to his nearest relative in the clan. This is my law, and the Israelites must obey it."
Numbers,27,12,"The LORD said to Moses, “One day you will go up into the Abarim Mountains, and from there you will see the land I am giving the Israelites."
Numbers,27,13,"After you have seen it, you will die, just like your brother Aaron,"
Numbers,27,14,"because both of you disobeyed me at Meribah near the town of Kadesh in the Zin Desert. When the Israelites insulted me there, you didn't believe in my holy power.”"
Numbers,27,15,"Moses replied,"
Numbers,27,16,"“You are the LORD God, and you know what is in everyone's heart. So I ask you to appoint a leader for Israel."
Numbers,27,17,"Your people need someone to lead them into battle, or else they will be like sheep wandering around without a shepherd.”"
Numbers,27,18,"The LORD answered, “Joshua son of Nun can do the job. Place your hands on him to show that he is the one to take your place."
Numbers,27,19,Then go with him and make him stand in front of Eleazar the priest and the Israelites. Appoint Joshua as their new leader
Numbers,27,20,"and tell them they must now obey him, just as they obey you."
Numbers,27,21,But Joshua must depend on Eleazar to find out from me what I want him to do as he leads Israel into battle.”
Numbers,27,22,"Moses followed the LORD 's instructions and took Joshua to Eleazar and the people,"
Numbers,27,23,then he placed his hands on Joshua and appointed him Israel's leader.
Numbers,28,1,The LORD told Moses
Numbers,28,2,"to say to the people of Israel: Offer sacrifices to me at the appointed times of worship, so that I will smell the smoke and be pleased."
Numbers,28,3,Each day offer two rams a year old as sacrifices to please me. The animals must have nothing wrong with them;
Numbers,28,4,"one will be sacrificed in the morning, and the other in the evening."
Numbers,28,5,"Along with each of them, one kilogramme of your finest flour mixed with a litre of olive oil must be offered as a grain sacrifice."
Numbers,28,6,This sacrifice to please me was first offered on Mount Sinai.
Numbers,28,7,"Finally, along with each of these two sacrifices, a litre of wine must be poured on the altar as a drink offering."
Numbers,28,8,"The second ram will be sacrificed that evening, along with the other offerings, just like the one sacrificed that morning. The smell of the smoke from these sacrifices will please me."
Numbers,29,1,"On the first day of the seventh month, you must rest from your work and come together to celebrate at the sound of the trumpets."
Numbers,29,2,"Bring to the altar one bull, one full-grown ram, and seven rams a year old that have nothing wrong with them. And then offer these as sacrifices to please me."
Numbers,29,3,"Three kilogrammes of your finest flour mixed with olive oil must be offered with the bull as a grain sacrifice. Two kilogrammes of flour mixed with oil must be offered with the ram,"
Numbers,29,4,and one kilogramme of flour mixed with oil must be offered with each of the young rams.
Numbers,29,5,You must also offer a goat as a sacrifice for sin.
Numbers,29,6,These sacrifices will be made in addition to the regular daily sacrifices and the sacrifices for the first day of the month. The smoke from these sacrifices will please me.
Numbers,29,7,"The tenth day of the seventh month is the Great Day of Forgiveness. On that day you must rest from all work and come together for worship. Show sorrow for your sins by going without food,"
Numbers,29,8,"and bring to the altar one young bull, one full-grown ram, and seven rams a year old that have nothing wrong with them. Then offer these as sacrifices to please me."
Numbers,29,9,"Three kilogrammes of your finest flour mixed with olive oil must be offered with the bull as a grain sacrifice. Two kilogrammes of flour mixed with oil must be offered with the ram,"
Numbers,29,10,and one kilogramme of flour mixed with oil must be offered with each of the young rams.
Numbers,29,11,A goat must also be sacrificed for the sins of the people. You will offer these sacrifices in addition to the sacrifice to ask forgiveness and the regular daily sacrifices.
Numbers,29,12,"Beginning on the fifteenth day of the seventh month and continuing for seven days, everyone must celebrate the Festival of Shelters in honour of me."
Numbers,29,13,"On the first day, you must rest from your work and come together for worship. Bring to the altar thirteen bulls, two full-grown rams, and fourteen rams a year old that have nothing wrong with them. Then offer these as sacrifices to please me."
Numbers,29,14,"Three kilogrammes of your finest flour mixed with olive oil must be offered with each bull as a grain sacrifice. Two kilogrammes of flour mixed with oil must be offered with each of the rams,"
Numbers,29,15,and one kilogramme of flour mixed with oil must be offered with each of the young rams.
Numbers,29,16,You must also offer a goat as a sacrifice for sin. These are to be offered in addition to the regular daily sacrifices.
Numbers,30,1,The LORD told Moses to say to Israel's tribal leaders:
Numbers,30,2,"When one of you men makes a promise to the LORD, you must keep your word."
Numbers,30,3,Suppose a young woman who is still living with her parents makes a promise to the LORD.
Numbers,30,4,"If her father hears about it and says nothing, she must keep her promise."
Numbers,30,5,"But if he hears about it and objects, then she no longer has to keep her promise. The LORD will forgive her, because her father did not agree with the promise."
Numbers,31,1,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,31,2,"“Before you die, make sure that the Midianites are punished for what they did to Israel.”"
Numbers,31,3,"Then Moses told the people, “The LORD wants to punish the Midianites. So tell our men to prepare for battle."
Numbers,31,4,Each tribe will send a thousand men to fight.”
Numbers,31,5,"Twelve thousand men were picked from the tribes of Israel, and after they were prepared for battle,"
Numbers,31,6,Moses sent them off to war. Phinehas the son of Eleazar went with them and took along some things from the sacred tent and the trumpets for sounding the battle signal.
Numbers,31,7,"The Israelites fought against the Midianites, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. They killed all the men,"
Numbers,31,8,"including Balaam son of Beor and the five Midianite kings, Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba."
Numbers,31,9,"The Israelites captured every woman and child, then led away the Midianites' cattle and sheep, and took everything else that belonged to them."
Numbers,31,10,They also burnt down the Midianite towns and villages.
Numbers,31,11,"Israel's soldiers gathered together everything they had taken from the Midianites, including the captives and the animals."
Numbers,32,1,"The tribes of Reuben and Gad owned a lot of cattle and sheep, and they saw that the regions of Jazer and Gilead had good pasture land."
Numbers,32,2,"So they went to Moses, Eleazar, and the other leaders of Israel and said,"
Numbers,33,1,"As Israel travelled from Egypt under the command of Moses and Aaron,"
Numbers,33,2,"Moses kept a list of the places where they camped, just as the LORD had instructed. Here is the record of their journey:"
Numbers,34,1,The LORD told Moses
Numbers,34,2,to tell the people of Israel that their land in Canaan would have the following borders:
Numbers,34,3,The southern border will be the Zin Desert and the north-west part of Edom. This border will begin at the south end of the Dead Sea.
Numbers,34,4,"It will go west from there, but will turn southward to include Scorpion Pass, the village of Zin, and the town of Kadesh-Barnea. From there, the border will continue to Hazar-Addar and on to Azmon."
Numbers,34,5,It will run along the Egyptian Gorge and end at the Mediterranean Sea.
Numbers,34,6,The western border will be the Mediterranean Sea.
Numbers,34,7,"The northern border will begin at the Mediterranean, then continue eastward to Mount Hor."
Numbers,34,8,"After that, it will run to Lebo-Hamath and across to Zedad, which is the northern edge of your land."
Numbers,34,9,"From Zedad, the border will continue east to Ziphron and end at Hazar-Enan."
Numbers,34,10,"The eastern border will begin at Hazar-Enan in the north, then run south to Shepham,"
Numbers,34,11,"and on down to Riblah on the east side of Ain. From there, it will go south to the eastern hills of Lake Galilee,"
Numbers,34,12,then follow the River Jordan down to the north end of the Dead Sea. The land within those four borders will belong to you.
Numbers,34,13,"Then Moses told the people, “You will receive the land inside these borders. It will be yours, but the LORD has commanded you to divide it among the nine and a half tribes."
Numbers,34,14,"The tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh have already been given their land"
Numbers,34,15,"across from Jericho, east of the River Jordan.”"
Numbers,34,16,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,34,17,“Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun will divide the land for the Israelites.
Numbers,34,18,"One leader from each tribe will help them,"
Numbers,35,1,"While the people of Israel were still camped in the lowlands of Moab across the River Jordan from Jericho, the LORD told Moses"
Numbers,35,2,"to say to them: When you receive your tribal lands, you must give towns and pastures to the Levi tribe."
Numbers,35,3,"That way, the Levites will have towns to live in and pastures for their animals."
Numbers,36,1,One day the family leaders from the Gilead clan of the Manasseh tribe went to Moses and the other family leaders of Israel
Numbers,36,2,"and said, “Sir, the LORD has said that he will show what land each tribe will receive as their own. And the LORD has commanded you to give the daughters of our relative Zelophehad the land that he would have received."
Numbers,36,3,"But if they marry men from other tribes of Israel, the land they receive will become part of that tribe's inheritance and will no longer belong to us."
Numbers,36,4,"Even when land is returned to its original owner in the Year of Celebration, we will not get back Zelophehad's land—it will belong to the tribe into which his daughters married.”"
Numbers,36,5,So Moses told the people that the LORD had said: These men from the Manasseh tribe are right.
Numbers,36,6,"I will allow Zelophehad's daughters to marry anyone, as long as those men belong to one of the clans of the Manasseh tribe."
Numbers,36,7,Tribal land must not be given to another tribe—it will remain the property of the tribe that received it.
Deuteronomy,2,1,"We spent many years wandering around outside the hill country of Seir,"
Deuteronomy,2,2,"until the LORD said: Moses,"
Deuteronomy,2,3,Israel has wandered in these hills long enough. Turn and go north.
Deuteronomy,2,4,"And give the people these orders: “Be very careful, because you will soon go through the land that belongs to your relatives, the descendants of Esau. They are afraid of you,"
Deuteronomy,2,5,"but don't start a war with them. I have given them the hill country of Seir, so I won't give any of it to you, not even enough to set a foot on."
Deuteronomy,2,6,"And as you go through their land, you will have to buy food and water from them.”"
Deuteronomy,2,7,"The LORD has helped us and taken care of us during the past forty years that we have been in this huge desert. We've had everything we needed, and the LORD has blessed us and made us successful in whatever we have done."
Deuteronomy,2,8,"We went past the territory that belonged to our relatives, the descendants of Esau. We followed Arabah Road that starts in the south at Elath and Ezion-Geber, then we turned on to the desert road that leads to Moab."
Deuteronomy,2,9,"The LORD told me, “Don't try to start a war with Moab. Leave them alone, because I gave the land of Ar to them, and I will not let you have any of it.”"
Deuteronomy,2,10,"Before the LORD gave the Moabites their land, a large and powerful tribe lived there. They were the Emim, and they were as tall as the Anakim."
Deuteronomy,2,11,"The Moabites called them Emim, though others sometimes used the name Rephaim for both the Anakim and the Emim."
Deuteronomy,2,12,"The Horites used to live in Seir, but the Edomites took over that region. They killed many of the Horites and forced the rest of them to leave, just as Israel did to the people in the land that the LORD gave them."
Deuteronomy,2,13,"When we came to the Zered Gorge along the southern border of Moab, the LORD told us to cross the gorge into Moab, and we did."
Deuteronomy,2,14,"This was thirty-eight years after we left Kadesh-Barnea, and by that time all the men who had been in the army at Kadesh-Barnea had died, just as the LORD had said they would."
Deuteronomy,3,1,"When we turned on to the road that leads to Bashan, King Og of Bashan led out his whole army to fight us at Edrei."
Deuteronomy,3,2,"But the LORD told me, “Moses, don't be afraid of King Og. I am going to help you defeat him and his army and take over his land. Destroy him and his people, just as you did with the Amorite King Sihon of Heshbon.”"
Deuteronomy,4,1,"Israel, listen to these laws and teachings! If you obey them, you will live, and you will go in and take the land that the LORD is giving you. He is the God your ancestors worshipped,"
Deuteronomy,4,2,"and now he is your God. I am telling you everything he has commanded, so don't add anything or take anything away."
Deuteronomy,4,3,You saw how he killed everyone who worshipped the god Baal-Peor.
Deuteronomy,4,4,But all of you who were faithful to the LORD your God are still alive today.
Deuteronomy,5,1,"Moses called together the people of Israel and said: Today I am telling you the laws and teachings that you must follow, so listen carefully."
Deuteronomy,5,2,The LORD our God made an agreement with our nation at Mount Sinai.
Deuteronomy,5,3,"That agreement wasn't only with our ancestors but with us, who are here today."
Deuteronomy,5,4,"The LORD himself spoke to you out of the fire,"
Deuteronomy,5,5,"but you were afraid of the fire and refused to go up the mountain. So I spoke with the LORD for you, then I told you that he had said:"
Deuteronomy,5,6,"I am the LORD your God, the one who brought you out of Egypt where you were slaves."
Deuteronomy,5,7,Do not worship any god except me.
Deuteronomy,5,8,Do not make idols that look like anything in the sky or on earth or in the ocean under the earth.
Deuteronomy,5,9,"Don't bow down and worship idols. I am the LORD your God, and I demand all your love. If you reject me and worship idols, I will punish your families for three or four generations."
Deuteronomy,5,10,"But if you love me and obey my laws, I will be kind to your families for thousands of generations."
Deuteronomy,5,11,"Do not misuse my name. I am the LORD your God, and I will punish anyone who misuses my name."
Deuteronomy,5,12,Show respect for the Sabbath Day—it belongs to me.
Deuteronomy,5,13,"You have six days when you can do your work,"
Deuteronomy,5,14,"but the seventh day of the week belongs to me, your God. No one is to work on that day—not you, your children, your oxen or donkeys or any other animal, not even those foreigners who live in your towns. And don't make your slaves do any work."
Deuteronomy,5,15,This special day of rest will remind you that I reached out my mighty arm and rescued you from slavery in Egypt.
Deuteronomy,5,16,"Respect your father and mother, and you will live a long and successful life in the land I am giving you."
Deuteronomy,5,17,Do not murder.
Deuteronomy,5,18,Be faithful in marriage.
Deuteronomy,5,19,Do not steal.
Deuteronomy,5,20,Do not tell lies about others.
Deuteronomy,5,21,"Do not want to take anything that belongs to someone else. Don't want to take anyone's wife or husband, house, land, slaves, oxen, donkeys, or anything else."
Deuteronomy,5,22,"When we were gathered on the mountain, the LORD spoke to us in a loud voice from the dark fiery cloud. The LORD gave us these commands, and only these. Then he wrote them on two flat stones and gave them to me."
Deuteronomy,5,23,"When fire blazed from the mountain, and you heard the voice coming from the darkness, your tribal leaders came to me"
Deuteronomy,5,24,"and said: Today the LORD our God has shown us how powerful and glorious he is. He spoke to us from the fire, and we learnt that people can live, even though God speaks to them."
Deuteronomy,5,25,"But we don't want to take a chance on being killed by that terrible fire, and if we keep on hearing the LORD 's voice, we will die."
Deuteronomy,5,26,"Has anyone else ever heard the only true God speaking from fire, as we have? And even if they have, would they live to tell about it?"
Deuteronomy,5,27,"Moses, go up close and listen to the LORD . Then come back and tell us, and we will do everything he says."
Deuteronomy,5,28,"The LORD heard you and said: Moses, I heard what the people said to you, and I approve."
Deuteronomy,5,29,I wish they would always worship me with fear and trembling and be this willing to obey me! Then they and their children would always enjoy a successful life.
Deuteronomy,5,30,"Now, tell them to return to their tents,"
Deuteronomy,5,31,"but you come back here to me. After I tell you my laws and teachings, you will repeat them to the people, so they can obey these laws in the land I am giving them."
Deuteronomy,5,32,"Israel, you must carefully obey the LORD 's commands."
Deuteronomy,5,33,"Follow them, because they make a path that will lead to a long successful life in the land the LORD your God is giving you."
Deuteronomy,6,1,"The LORD told me to give you these laws and teachings, so you can obey them in the land he is giving you. Soon you will cross the River Jordan and take that land."
Deuteronomy,6,2,"And if you and your descendants want to live a long time, you must always worship the LORD and obey his laws."
Deuteronomy,6,3,"Pay attention, Israel! Our ancestors worshipped the LORD , and he promised to give us this land that is rich with milk and honey. Be careful to obey him, and you will become a successful and powerful nation."
Deuteronomy,6,4,"Listen, Israel! The LORD our God is the only true God!"
Deuteronomy,6,5,"So love the LORD your God with all your heart, soul, and strength."
Deuteronomy,6,6,Memorize his laws
Deuteronomy,6,7,"and tell them to your children over and over again. Talk about them all the time, whether you're at home or walking along the road or going to bed at night, or getting up in the morning."
Deuteronomy,6,8,Write down copies and tie them to your wrists and foreheads to help you obey them.
Deuteronomy,6,9,Write these laws on the door frames of your homes and on your town gates.
Deuteronomy,6,10,"The LORD promised your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that he would give you this land. Now he will take you there and give you large towns, with good buildings that you didn't build,"
Deuteronomy,6,11,"and houses full of good things that you didn't put there. The LORD will give you wells that you didn't have to dig, and vineyards and olive orchards that you didn't have to plant. But when you have eaten so much that you can't eat any more,"
Deuteronomy,6,12,don't forget it was the LORD who set you free from slavery and brought you out of Egypt.
Deuteronomy,6,13,"Worship and obey the LORD your God with fear and trembling, and promise that you will be loyal to him."
Deuteronomy,6,14,Don't have anything to do with gods that are worshipped by the nations around you.
Deuteronomy,6,15,"If you worship other gods, the LORD will be furious and wipe you off the face of the earth. The LORD your God is with you,"
Deuteronomy,6,16,"so don't try to make him prove that he can help you, as you did at Massah."
Deuteronomy,6,17,Always obey the laws that the LORD has given you
Deuteronomy,7,1,"People of Israel, the LORD your God will help you take the land of the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. These seven nations have more people and are stronger than Israel, but when you attack them,"
Deuteronomy,7,2,"the LORD will force them out of the land. Then you must destroy them without mercy. Don't make any peace treaties with them,"
Deuteronomy,7,3,and don't let your sons and daughters marry any of them.
Deuteronomy,7,4,"If you do, those people will lead your descendants to worship other gods and to turn their backs on the LORD . That will make him very angry, and he will quickly destroy Israel."
Deuteronomy,7,5,"So when you conquer these nations, tear down the altars where they worship their gods. Break up their sacred stones, cut down the poles that they use in worshipping the goddess Asherah, and throw their idols in the fire."
Deuteronomy,7,6,"Israel, you are the chosen people of the LORD your God. There are many nations on this earth, but he chose only Israel to be his very own."
Deuteronomy,7,7,"You were the weakest of all nations,"
Deuteronomy,7,8,"but the LORD chose you because he loves you and because he had made a promise to your ancestors. Then with his mighty arm, he rescued you from the king of Egypt, who had made you his slaves."
Deuteronomy,7,9,"You know that the LORD your God is the only true God. So love him and obey his commands, and he will faithfully keep his agreement with you and your descendants for a thousand generations."
Deuteronomy,7,10,"But if you turn against the LORD , he will quickly destroy you."
Deuteronomy,7,11,So be sure to obey his laws and teachings I am giving you today.

Deuteronomy,11,1,"The LORD is your God, so you must always love him and obey his laws and teachings."
Deuteronomy,11,2,"Remember, he corrected you and not your children. You are the ones who saw the LORD use his great power"
Deuteronomy,11,3,"when he worked miracles in Egypt, making terrible things happen to the king and all his people."
Deuteronomy,11,4,"And when the Egyptian army chased you in their chariots, you saw the LORD drown them and their horses in the Red Sea. Egypt still suffers from that defeat!"

Deuteronomy,12,3,"Wherever these nations worship their gods, you must tear down their altars, break their sacred stones, burn the sacred poles used in worshipping the goddess Asherah, and smash their idols to pieces.

Deuteronomy,30,1,"I have told you everything the LORD your God will do for you, and I've also told you the curses he will put on you if you reject him. He will scatter you in faraway countries, but when you realize that he is punishing you,"

Deuteronomy,32,4,"The LORD is a mighty rock, and he never does wrong. God can always be trusted to bring justice."

Deuteronomy,32,6,"Israel, the LORD is your Father, the one who created you, but you repaid him by being foolish."
Deuteronomy,32,7,Think about past generations. Ask your parents or any of your elders. They will tell you

Deuteronomy,32,10,"Israel, the LORD discovered you in a barren desert filled with howling winds. God became your fortress, protecting you as though you were his own eyes."
Deuteronomy,32,11,"The LORD was like an eagle teaching its young to fly, always ready to swoop down and catch them on its back."
Deuteronomy,32,12,"Israel, the LORD led you, and without the aid of a foreign god,"
Deuteronomy,32,13,"he helped you capture the land. Your fields were rich with grain. Olive trees grew in your stony soil, and honey was found among the rocks."
Deuteronomy,32,14,"Your flocks and herds produced milk and yoghurt, and you got choice meat from your sheep and goats that grazed in Bashan. Your wheat was the finest, and you drank the best wine."

Deuteronomy,32,31,Even our enemies know that only our God is a Mighty Rock.
Deuteronomy,32,32,Our enemies are grapevines rooted in the fields of Sodom and Gomorrah. The grapes they produce are full of bitter poison;
Deuteronomy,32,33,their wine is more deadly than cobra venom.
Deuteronomy,32,34,But the LORD has written a list of their sins and locked it in his vault.
Deuteronomy,32,35,"Soon our enemies will get what they deserve — suddenly they will slip, and total disaster will quickly follow."
Deuteronomy,32,36,"When only a few of the LORD 's people remain, when their strength is gone, and some of them are slaves, the LORD will feel sorry for them and give them justice."
Deuteronomy,32,37,"But first the LORD will say, “You ran for safety to other gods— couldn't they help you?"
Deuteronomy,32,38,You offered them wine and your best sacrifices. Can't those gods help you now or give you protection?
Deuteronomy,32,39,"Don't you understand? I am the only God; there are no others. I am the one who takes life and gives it again. I punished you with suffering. But now I will heal you, and nothing can stop me!"
Deuteronomy,32,40,"“I make this solemn promise: just as I live for ever,"
Deuteronomy,32,41,I will take revenge on my hateful enemies. I will sharpen my sword and let it flash like lightning.

Deuteronomy,32,43,"Tell the heavens to celebrate and all gods to bow down to the LORD, because he will take revenge on those hateful enemies who killed his people. He will forgive the sins of Israel and purify their land."
Deuteronomy,33,1,"Moses was a prophet, and before he died, he blessed the tribes of Israel by saying:"
Deuteronomy,33,2,"The LORD came from Mount Sinai. From Edom, he gave light to his people, and his glory was shining from Mount Paran. Thousands of his warriors were with him, and fire was at his right hand."
Deuteronomy,33,3,"The LORD loves the tribes of Israel, and he protects his people. They listen to his words and worship at his feet."
Deuteronomy,34,1,"Some time later, Moses left the lowlands of Moab. He went up Mount Pisgah to the peak of Mount Nebo, which is across the River Jordan from Jericho. The LORD showed him all the land as far north as Gilead and the town of Dan."
Deuteronomy,34,2,"He let Moses see the territories that would soon belong to the tribes of Naphtali, Ephraim, Manasseh, and Judah, as far west as the Mediterranean Sea."
Deuteronomy,34,3,"The LORD also showed him the land in the south, from the valley near the town of Jericho, known as The City of Palm Trees, down to the town of Zoar."
Deuteronomy,34,4,"The LORD said, “Moses, this is the land I was talking about when I solemnly promised Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that I would give land to their descendants. I have let you see it, but you will not cross the Jordan and go in.”"
Deuteronomy,34,5,"And so, Moses the LORD 's servant died there in Moab, just as the LORD had said."
Deuteronomy,34,6,"The LORD buried him in a valley near the town of Beth-Peor, but even today no one knows exactly where."
Deuteronomy,34,7,"Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died, yet his eyesight was still good, and his body was strong."
Deuteronomy,34,8,"The people of Israel stayed in the lowlands of Moab, where they mourned and grieved thirty days for Moses, as was their custom."
Deuteronomy,34,9,"Before Moses died, he had placed his hands on Joshua, and the LORD had given Joshua wisdom. The Israelites paid attention to what Joshua said and obeyed the commands that the LORD had given Moses."
Deuteronomy,34,10,There has never again been a prophet in Israel like Moses. The LORD spoke face to face with him
Deuteronomy,34,11,and sent him to perform powerful miracles in the presence of the king of Egypt and his entire nation.
Deuteronomy,34,12,No one else has ever had the power to do such great things as Moses did for everyone to see.
Joshua,1,1,"Moses, the LORD 's servant, was dead. So the LORD spoke to Joshua son of Nun, who had been the assistant of Moses. The LORD said:"
Joshua,1,2,My servant Moses is dead. Now you must lead Israel across the River Jordan into the land I'm giving to all of you.
Joshua,1,3,"Wherever you go, I'll give you that land, as I promised Moses."
Joshua,1,4,"It will reach from the Southern Desert to the Lebanon Mountains in the north, and to the north-east as far as the great River Euphrates. It will include the land of the Hittites, and the land from here at the River Jordan to the Mediterranean Sea on the west."
Joshua,1,5,"Joshua, I will always be with you and help you as I helped Moses, and no one will ever be able to defeat you."
Joshua,2,1,"Joshua chose two men as spies and sent them from their camp at Acacia with these instructions: “Go across the river and find out as much as you can about the whole region, especially about the town of Jericho.” The two spies left the Israelite camp at Acacia and went to Jericho, where they decided to spend the night at the house of a prostitute named Rahab."
Joshua,2,2,"But someone found out about them and told the king of Jericho, “Some Israelite men came here tonight, and they are spies.”"
Joshua,3,1,"Early the next morning, Joshua and the Israelites packed up and left Acacia. They went to the River Jordan and camped there that night."
Joshua,3,2,"Two days later their leaders went through the camp,"
Joshua,4,1,"After Israel had crossed the Jordan, the LORD said to Joshua:"
Joshua,5,1,"The Amorite kings west of the River Jordan and the Canaanite kings along the Mediterranean Sea lost their courage and their will to fight, when they heard how the LORD had dried up the River Jordan to let Israel go across."
Joshua,5,2,"While Israel was camped at Gilgal, the LORD said, “Joshua, make some flint knives and circumcise the rest of the Israelite men and boys.”"
Joshua,5,3,"Joshua made the knives, then circumcised those men and boys at Haaraloth Hill."
Joshua,6,1,"Meanwhile, the people of Jericho had been locking the gates in their town wall because they were afraid of the Israelites. No one could go out or come in."
Joshua,7,1,"The LORD had said that everything in Jericho belonged to him. But Achan from the Judah tribe took some of the things from Jericho for himself. And so the LORD was angry with the Israelites, because one of them had disobeyed him."
Joshua,7,2,"While Israel was still camped near Jericho, Joshua sent some spies with these instructions: “Go to the town of Ai and find out whatever you can about the region around the town.” The spies left and went to Ai, which is east of Bethel and near Beth-Aven."
Joshua,7,3,"They went back to Joshua and reported, “You don't need to send the whole army to attack Ai—two or three thousand troops will be enough. Why bother the whole army for a town that small?”"
Joshua,10,1,"King Adonizedek of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had captured and destroyed the town of Ai, and then killed its king as he had done at Jericho. He also learnt that the Gibeonites had signed a peace treaty with Israel."
Joshua,10,2,"This frightened Adonizedek and his people. They knew that Gibeon was a large town, as big as the towns that had kings, and even bigger than the town of Ai had been. And all the men of Gibeon were warriors."
Joshua,10,3,"So Adonizedek sent messages to the kings of four other towns: King Hoham of Hebron, King Piram of Jarmuth, King Japhia of Lachish, and King Debir of Eglon. The messages said,"
Joshua,10,4,“The Gibeonites have signed a peace treaty with Joshua and the Israelites. Come and help me attack Gibeon!”
Joshua,10,5,"When these five Amorite kings called their armies together and attacked Gibeon,"
Joshua,10,6,"the Gibeonites sent a message to the Israelite camp at Gilgal: “Joshua, please come and rescue us! The Amorite kings from the hill country have joined together and are attacking us. We are your servants, so don't let us down. Please hurry!”"
Joshua,10,7,"Joshua and his army, including his best warriors, left Gilgal."
Joshua,10,8,"“Joshua,” the LORD said, “don't be afraid of the Amorites. They will run away when you attack, and I will help you defeat them.”"
Joshua,10,9,Joshua marched all night from Gilgal to Gibeon and made a surprise attack on the Amorite camp.
Joshua,10,10,"The LORD made the enemy panic, and the Israelites started killing them right and left. They chased the Amorite troops up the road to Beth-Horon and kept on killing them, until they reached the towns of Azekah and Makkedah."
Joshua,10,11,"And while these troops were going down through Beth-Horon Pass, the LORD made huge hailstones fall on them all the way to Azekah. More of the enemy soldiers died from the hail than from the Israelite weapons."
Joshua,11,1,"King Jabin of Hazor heard about Joshua's victories, so he sent messages to many nearby kings and asked them to join him in fighting Israel. He sent these messages to King Jobab of Madon, the kings of Shimron and Achshaph,"
Joshua,11,2,"the kings in the northern hill country and in the valley of the River Jordan south of Lake Galilee, and the kings in the foothills and in Naphath-Dor to the west."
Joshua,11,3,"He sent messages to the Canaanite kings in the east and the west, to the Amorite, Hittite, Perizzite, and Jebusite kings in the hill country, and to the Hivite kings in the region of Mizpah, near the foot of Mount Hermon."
Joshua,12,1,"Before Moses died, he and the people of Israel had defeated two kings east of the River Jordan. These kings had ruled the region from the gorge of the River Arnon in the south to Mount Hermon in the north, including the eastern side of the Jordan valley."
Joshua,12,2,"The first king whom Moses and the Israelites defeated was an Amorite, King Sihon of Heshbon. The southern border of his kingdom ran down the middle of the Arnon gorge, taking in the town of Aroer on the northern edge of the gorge. The River Jabbok separated Sihon's kingdom from the Ammonites on the east. Then the Jabbok turned west and became his northern border, so his kingdom included the southern half of the region of Gilead."
Joshua,12,3,"Sihon also controlled the eastern side of the Jordan valley from Lake Galilee south to Beth-Jeshimoth and the Dead Sea. In addition to these regions, he ruled the town called Slopes of Mount Pisgah and the land south of there at the foot of the hill."
Joshua,12,4,"Next, Moses and the Israelites defeated King Og of Bashan, who lived in the town of Ashtaroth part of each year and in Edrei the rest of the year. Og was one of the last of the Rephaim."
Joshua,12,5,"His kingdom stretched north to Mount Hermon, east to the town of Salecah, and included the land of Bashan as far west as the borders of the kingdoms of Geshur and Maacah. He also ruled the northern half of Gilead."
Joshua,12,6,"Moses, the LORD 's servant, had led the people of Israel in defeating Sihon and Og. Then Moses gave their land to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh."
Joshua,13,1,"Many years later, the LORD told Joshua: Now you are very old, but there is still a lot of land that Israel has not yet taken."
Joshua,15,1,"The clans of the Judah tribe were given land that went south along the border of Edom, and at its furthest point south it even reached the Zin Desert."
Joshua,15,2,Judah's southern border started at the south end of the Dead Sea.
Joshua,15,3,"As it went west from there, it ran south of Scorpion Pass to Zin, and then came up from the south to Kadesh-Barnea. It continued past Hezron up to Addar, turned towards Karka,"
Joshua,15,4,"and ran along to Azmon. After that, it followed the Egyptian Gorge and ended at the Mediterranean Sea. This was also Israel's southern border."
Joshua,15,5,Judah's eastern border ran the full length of the Dead Sea. The northern border started at the northern end of the Dead Sea.
Joshua,15,6,"From there it went west up to Beth-Hoglah, continued north of Beth-Arabah, and went up to the Monument of Bohan, who belonged to the Reuben tribe."
Joshua,15,7,"From there, it went to Trouble Valley and Debir, then turned north and went to Gilgal, which is on the north side of the valley across from Adummim Pass. It continued on to Enshemesh, Enrogel,"
Joshua,15,8,"and up through Hinnom Valley on the land sloping south from Jerusalem. The city of Jerusalem itself belonged to the Jebusites. Next, the border went up to the top of the mountain on the west side of Hinnom Valley and at the north end of Rephaim Valley."
Joshua,15,9,"At the top of the mountain it turned and went to Nephtoah Spring and then to the ruins on Mount Ephron. From there, it went to Baalah, which is now called Kiriath-Jearim."
Joshua,15,10,"From Baalah the northern border curved west to Mount Seir and then ran along the northern ridge of Mount Jearim, where Chesalon is. Then it went down to Beth-Shemesh and over to Timnah."
Joshua,15,11,"It continued along to the hillside north of Ekron, curved around to Shikkeron, and then went to Mount Baalah. After going to Jabneel, the border finally ended at the Mediterranean Sea,"
Joshua,15,12,which was Judah's western border. The clans of Judah lived within these borders.
Joshua,15,13,"Joshua gave Caleb some land among the people of Judah, as God had told him to do. Caleb's share was Hebron, which at that time was known as Arba's Town, because Arba was the famous ancestor of the Anakim."
Joshua,15,14,"Caleb attacked Hebron and forced the three Anakim clans of Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai to leave."
Joshua,15,15,"Next, Caleb started a war with the town of Debir, which at that time was called Kiriath-Sepher."
Joshua,15,16,"He told his men, “The man who captures Kiriath-Sepher can marry my daughter Achsah.”"
Joshua,15,17,"Caleb's nephew Othniel captured Kiriath-Sepher, and Caleb let him marry Achsah."
Joshua,15,18,"Straight after the wedding, Achsah started telling Othniel that he ought to ask her father for a field. She went to see her father, and while she was getting down from her donkey, Caleb asked her, “What's bothering you?”"
Joshua,15,19,"She answered, “I need your help. The land you gave me is in the Southern Desert, so I really need some spring-fed ponds for a water supply.” Caleb gave her a couple of small ponds, named Higher Pond and Lower Pond."
Joshua,15,20,The following is a list of the towns in each region given to the Judah clans:
Joshua,18,1,"After Israel had captured the land, they met at Shiloh and set up the sacred tent."
Joshua,18,2,"There were still seven tribes without any land,"
Joshua,19,1,"Simeon was the second tribe chosen to receive land, and the region for its clans was inside Judah's borders."
Joshua,20,1,One day the LORD told Joshua:
Joshua,20,2,"When Moses was still alive, I told him to tell the Israelites about the Safe Towns. Now you tell them that it is time to set up these towns."
Joshua,22,1,"Joshua called the men of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh to a meeting, and he told them:"
Joshua,23,1,"The LORD let Israel live in peace with its neighbours for a long time, and Joshua lived to a ripe old age."
Joshua,23,2,"One day he called a meeting of the leaders of the tribes of Israel, including the old men, the judges, and the officials. Then he told them: I am now very old."
Joshua,23,3,You have seen how the LORD your God fought for you and helped you defeat the nations who lived in this land.
Joshua,24,1,"Joshua called the tribes of Israel together for a meeting at Shechem. He made the leaders, including the old men, the judges, and the officials, come up and stand near the sacred tent."
Joshua,24,2,"Then Joshua told everyone to listen to this message from the LORD , the God of Israel: Long ago your ancestors lived on the other side of the River Euphrates, and they worshipped other gods. This continued until the time of your ancestor Terah and his two sons, Abraham and Nahor."
Joshua,24,3,"But I brought Abraham across the River Euphrates and led him through the land of Canaan. I blessed him by giving him Isaac, the first in a line of many descendants."
Joshua,24,4,"Then I gave Isaac two sons, Jacob and Esau. I let Esau live in the hill country of Mount Seir, but your ancestor Jacob and his children went to live in Egypt."
Judges,1,1,"After the death of Joshua, the Israelites asked the LORD , “Which of our tribes should attack the Canaanites first?”"
Judges,1,2,“Judah!” the LORD answered. “I'll help them take the land.”
Judges,1,3,"The people of Judah went to their relatives, the Simeon tribe, and said, “Canaanites live in the land God gave us. Help us fight them, and we will help you.” Troops from Simeon came to help Judah."
Judges,2,1,"The LORD 's angel went from Gilgal to Bochim and gave the Israelites this message from the LORD: I promised your ancestors that I would give this land to their families, and I brought your people here from Egypt. We made an agreement that I promised never to break,"
Judges,2,2,"and you promised not to make any peace treaties with the other nations that live in the land. Besides that, you agreed to tear down the altars where they sacrifice to their idols. But you didn't keep your promise."
Judges,2,3,"And so, I'll stop helping you defeat your enemies. Instead, they will be there to trap you into worshipping their idols."
Judges,2,4,"The Israelites started crying loudly,"
Judges,2,5,"and they offered sacrifices to the LORD . From then on, they called that place “Crying”."
Judges,4,1,"After the death of Ehud, the Israelites again started disobeying the LORD."
Judges,4,2,"So the LORD let the Canaanite King Jabin of Hazor conquer Israel. Sisera, the commander of Jabin's army, lived in Harosheth-Ha-Goiim."
Judges,4,3,"Jabin's army had nine hundred iron chariots, and for twenty years he made life miserable for the Israelites, until finally they begged the LORD for help."
Judges,4,4,Deborah the wife of Lappidoth was a prophet and a leader of Israel during those days.
Judges,4,5,"She would sit under Deborah's Palm Tree between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, where Israelites would come and ask her to settle their legal cases."
Judges,4,6,"One day, Barak the son of Abinoam was in Kedesh in Naphtali, and Deborah sent word for him to come and talk with her. When he arrived, she said: I have a message for you from the LORD God of Israel! You are to get together an army of ten thousand men from the Naphtali and Zebulun tribes and lead them to Mount Tabor."
Judges,4,7,"The LORD will trick Sisera into coming out to fight you at the River Kishon. Sisera will be leading King Jabin's army as usual, and they will have their chariots, but the LORD has promised to help you defeat them."
Judges,4,8,“I'm not going unless you go!” Barak told her.
Judges,4,9,"“All right, I'll go!” she replied. “But I'm warning you that the LORD is going to let a woman defeat Sisera, and no one will honour you for winning the battle.” Deborah and Barak left for Kedesh,"
Judges,4,10,"where Barak called together the troops from Zebulun and Naphtali. Ten thousand soldiers gathered there, and Barak led them out from Kedesh. Deborah went too."
Judges,4,11,"At this time, Heber of the Kenite clan was living near the village of Oak in Zaanannim, not far from Kedesh. The Kenites were descendants of Hobab, the father-in-law of Moses, but Heber had moved and had set up his tents away from the rest of the clan."
Judges,4,12,"When Sisera learnt that Barak had led an army to Mount Tabor,"
Judges,4,13,he called his troops together and got all nine hundred iron chariots ready. Then he led his army away from Harosheth-Ha-Goiim to the River Kishon.
Judges,4,14,"Deborah shouted, “Barak, it's time to attack Sisera! Because today the LORD is going to help you defeat him. In fact, the LORD has already gone on ahead to fight for you.” Barak led his ten thousand troops down from Mount Tabor."
Judges,4,15,"And during the battle, the LORD confused Sisera, his chariot drivers, and his whole army. Everyone was so afraid of Barak and his army, that even Sisera jumped down from his chariot and tried to escape."
Judges,4,16,Barak's forces went after Sisera's chariots and army as far as Harosheth-Ha-Goiim. Sisera's entire army was wiped out.
Judges,4,17,"Only Sisera escaped. He ran to Heber's camp, because Heber and his family had a peace treaty with the king of Hazor. Sisera went to the tent that belonged to Jael, Heber's wife."
Judges,4,18,"She came out to greet him and said, “Come in, sir! Please come on in. Don't be afraid.” After they had gone inside, Sisera lay down, and Jael covered him with a blanket."
Judges,4,19,"“Could I have a little water?” he asked. “I'm thirsty.” Jael opened a leather bottle and poured him some milk, then she covered him up again."
Judges,4,20,"“Stand at the entrance to the tent,” Sisera told her. “If someone comes by and asks if anyone is inside, tell them ‘No.’ ”"
Judges,4,21,"Sisera was exhausted and soon fell fast asleep. Jael took a hammer and drove a tent peg through his head into the ground, and he died."
Judges,4,22,"Meanwhile, Barak had been following Sisera, and Jael went out to meet him. “The man you're looking for is inside,” she said. “Come in and I'll show him to you.” They went inside, and there was Sisera—dead and stretched out with a tent peg through his skull."
Judges,4,23,"That same day the Israelites defeated the Canaanite King Jabin, and his army was no longer powerful enough to attack the Israelites."
Judges,4,24,"Jabin grew weaker while the Israelites kept growing stronger, and at last the Israelites destroyed him."
Judges,5,1,"After the battle was over that day, Deborah and Barak sang this song:"
Judges,5,2,"We praise you, LORD! Our soldiers volunteered, ready to follow you."
Judges,5,3,"Listen, kings and rulers, while I sing for the LORD, the God of Israel."
Judges,6,1,"Then once again the Israelites started disobeying the LORD , so he let the nation of Midian control Israel for seven years."
Judges,6,2,The Midianites were so cruel that many Israelites ran to the mountains and hid in caves.
Judges,6,3,"Every time the Israelites would plant crops, the Midianites invaded Israel together with the Amalekites and other eastern nations."
Judges,7,1,"Early the next morning, Gideon and his army got up and moved their camp to Fear Spring. The Midianite camp was to the north, in the valley at the foot of Moreh Hill."
Judges,7,2,"The LORD said, “Gideon, your army is too big. I can't let you win with this many soldiers. The Israelites would think that they had won the battle all by themselves and that I didn't have anything to do with it."
Judges,7,3,"So call your troops together and tell them that anyone who is really afraid can leave Mount Gilead and go home.” Twenty-two thousand men returned home, leaving Gideon with only ten thousand soldiers."
Judges,7,4,"“Gideon,” the LORD said, “you still have too many soldiers. Take them down to the spring and I'll test them. I'll tell you which ones can go along with you and which ones must go back home.”"
Judges,7,5,"When Gideon led his army down to the spring, the LORD told him, “Watch how each man gets a drink of water. Then divide them into two groups—those who lap the water like a dog and those who kneel down to drink.”"
Judges,7,6,"Three hundred men scooped up water in their hands and lapped it, and the rest knelt to get a drink."
Judges,7,7,"The LORD said, “Gideon, your army will be made up of everyone who lapped the water from their hands. Send the others home. I'm going to rescue Israel by helping you and your army of three hundred defeat the Midianites.”"
Judges,7,8,"Then Gideon gave these orders, “You three hundred men stay here. The rest of you may go home, but leave your food and trumpets with us.” Gideon's army camp was on top of a hill overlooking the Midianite camp in the valley."
Judges,7,9,"That night, the LORD said to Gideon. “Get up! Attack the Midianite camp. I am going to let you defeat them,"
Judges,7,10,"but if you're still afraid, you and your servant Purah should sneak down to their camp."
Judges,7,11,"When you hear what the Midianites are saying, you'll be brave enough to attack.” Gideon and Purah worked their way to the edge of the enemy camp, where soldiers were on guard duty."
Judges,7,12,"The camp was huge. The Midianites, Amalekites, and other eastern nations covered the valley like a swarm of locusts. And it would be easier to count the grains of sand on a beach than to count their camels."
Judges,7,13,"Gideon overheard one enemy guard telling another, “I had a dream about a flat loaf of barley bread that came tumbling into our camp. It hit the headquarters tent, and the tent tipped over and fell down.”"
Judges,7,14,"The other soldier answered, “Your dream must have been about Gideon, the Israelite commander. It means God will let him and his army defeat the Midianite army and everyone else in our camp.”"
Judges,7,15,"As soon as Gideon heard about the dream and what it meant, he bowed down to praise God. Then he went back to the Israelite camp and shouted, “Let's go! The LORD is going to let us defeat the Midianite army.”"
Judges,7,16,"Gideon divided his little army into three groups of one hundred men, and he gave each soldier a trumpet and a large clay jar with a burning torch inside."
Judges,8,1,"But the men were really upset with Gideon and complained, “When you went to war with Midian, you didn't ask us to help! Why did you treat us like that?”"
Judges,8,2,"Gideon answered: Don't be upset! Even though you came later, you were able to do much more than I did. It's just like the grape harvest: the grapes your tribe doesn't even bother to pick are better than the best grapes my family can grow."
Judges,8,3,"Besides, God chose you to capture Raven and Wolf. I didn't do a thing compared to you. By the time Gideon had finished talking, the men of Ephraim had calmed down and were no longer angry with him."
Judges,8,4,"After Gideon and his three hundred troops had chased the Midianites as far as the River Jordan, they were exhausted."
Judges,8,5,"The town of Succoth was nearby, so he went there and asked, “Please give my troops some food. They are worn out, but we have to keep chasing Zebah and Zalmunna, the two Midianite kings.”"
Judges,8,6,"The town leaders of Succoth answered, “Why should we feed your army? We don't know if you really will defeat Zebah and Zalmunna.”"
Judges,8,7,"“Just wait!” Gideon said. “After the LORD helps me defeat them, I'm coming back here. I'll make a whip out of thorns and rip the flesh from your bones.”"
Judges,8,8,"After leaving Succoth, Gideon went to Penuel and asked the leaders there for some food. But he got the same answer as he had got at Succoth."
Judges,8,9,"“I'll come back safe and sound,” Gideon said, “but when I do, I'm going to tear down your tower!”"
Judges,8,10,"Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with an army of fifteen thousand troops. They were all that was left of the army of the eastern nations, because one hundred and twenty thousand of their warriors had been killed in the battle."
Judges,8,11,"Gideon reached the enemy camp by going east along Nomad Road past Nobah and Jogbehah. He made a surprise attack,"
Judges,8,12,"and the enemy panicked. Zebah and Zalmunna tried to escape, but Gideon chased and captured them."
Judges,8,13,"After the battle, Gideon set out for home. As he was going through Heres Pass,"
Judges,8,14,"he caught a young man who lived in Succoth. Gideon asked him who the town officials of Succoth were, and the young man wrote down seventy-seven names."
Judges,8,15,"Gideon went to the town officials and said, “Here are Zebah and Zalmunna. Remember how you made fun of me? You said, ‘We don't know if you really will defeat those two Midianite kings. So why should we feed your worn out army?’ ”"
Judges,8,16,Gideon made a whip from thorn plants and used it to beat the town officials.
Judges,8,17,"Afterwards he went to Penuel, where he tore down the tower and killed all the town officials there."
Judges,8,18,"Then Gideon said, “Zebah and Zalmunna, tell me about the men you killed at Tabor.” “They were a lot like you,” the two kings answered. “They were dignified, almost like royalty.”"
Judges,8,19,"“They were my very own brothers!” Gideon said. “I swear by the living LORD that if you had let them live, I would let you live.”"
Judges,8,20,"Gideon turned to Jether, his eldest son. “Kill them!” Gideon said. But Jether was young, and he was too afraid even to pull out his sword."
Judges,8,21,"“What's the matter, Gideon?” Zebah and Zalmunna asked. “Do it yourself, if you're not too much of a coward!” Gideon jumped up and killed them both. Then he took the fine gold ornaments from the necks of their camels."
Judges,8,22,"After the battle with the Midianites, the Israelites said, “Gideon, you rescued us! Now we want you to be our king. Then after your death, your son and then your grandson will rule.”"
Judges,8,23,"“No,” Gideon replied, “I won't be your king, and my son won't be king either. Only the LORD is your ruler."
Judges,8,24,"But I will ask you to do one thing: give me all the earrings you took from the enemy.” The enemy soldiers had been Ishmaelites, and they wore gold earrings."
Judges,8,25,"The Israelite soldiers replied, “Of course we will give you the earrings.” Then they spread out a robe on the ground and tossed the earrings on it."
Judges,8,26,"The total weight of this gold was nearly twenty kilogrammes. In addition, there was the gold from the camels' ornaments and from the beautiful jewellery worn by the Midianite kings. Gideon also took their purple robes."
Judges,9,1,"Abimelech the son of Gideon went to Shechem. While there, he met with his mother's relatives"
Judges,9,2,"and told them to say to the leaders of Shechem, “Do you think it would be good to have all seventy of Gideon's sons ruling us? Wouldn't you rather have just one man as king? Abimelech would make a good king, and he's related to us.”"
Judges,9,3,"Abimelech's uncles talked it over with the leaders of Shechem who agreed, “Yes, it would be better for one of our relatives to be king.”"
Judges,9,4,Then they gave Abimelech seventy pieces of silver from the temple of their god Baal Berith. Abimelech used the silver to hire a gang of rough soldiers who would do anything for money.
Judges,9,5,"Abimelech and his soldiers went to his father's home in Ophrah and brought out Gideon's other sons to a large rock, where they murdered all seventy. Gideon's youngest son Jotham hid from the soldiers, but he was the only one who escaped."
Judges,9,6,"The leaders of Shechem, including the priests and the military officers, met at the tree next to the sacred rock in Shechem to crown Abimelech king."
Judges,9,7,"Jotham heard what they were doing. So he climbed to the top of Mount Gerizim and shouted down to the people who were there at the meeting: Leaders of Shechem, listen to me, and perhaps God will listen to you."
Judges,9,8,"Once the trees searched for someone to be king; they asked the olive tree, “Will you be our king?”"
Judges,9,9,"But the olive tree replied, “My oil brings honour to people and gods. I won't stop making oil, just so my branches can wave above the other trees.”"
Judges,9,10,"Then they asked the fig tree, “Will you be our king?”"
Judges,9,11,"But the fig tree replied, “I won't stop growing my delicious fruit, just so my branches can wave above the other trees.”"
Judges,9,12,"Next they asked the grapevine, “Will you be our king?”"
Judges,9,13,"But the grapevine replied, “My wine brings cheer to people and gods. I won't stop making wine, just so my branches can wave above the other trees.”"
Judges,9,14,"Finally, they went to the thorn bush and asked, “Will you be our king?”"
Judges,9,15,"The thorn bush replied, “If you really want me to be your king, then come into my shade and I will protect you. But if you're deceiving me, I'll start a fire that will spread out and destroy the cedars of Lebanon.” After Jotham had finished telling this story, he said:"
Judges,10,1,"Tola was the next person to rescue Israel. He belonged to the Issachar tribe, but he lived in Shamir, a town in the hill country of Ephraim. His father was Puah, and his grandfather was Dodo."
Judges,10,2,"Tola was a leader of Israel for twenty-three years, then he died and was buried in Shamir."
Judges,10,3,"The next leader of Israel was Jair, who lived in Gilead. He was a leader for twenty-two years."
Judges,10,4,"He had thirty sons, and each son had his own mule and was in charge of one town in Gilead. Those thirty towns are still called The Settlements of Jair."
Judges,10,5,"When he died, he was buried in the town of Kamon."
Judges,10,6,"Before long, the Israelites began disobeying the LORD by worshipping Baal, Astarte, and gods from Syria, Sidon, Moab, Ammon, and Philistia."
Judges,10,7,The LORD was angry with Israel and decided to let Philistia and Ammon conquer them.
Judges,10,8,"So the same year that Jair died, Israel's army was crushed by these two nations. For eighteen years, Ammon was cruel to the Israelites who lived in Gilead, the region east of the River Jordan that had once belonged to the Amorites."
Judges,10,9,"Then the Ammonites began crossing the Jordan and attacking the tribes of Judah, Benjamin, and Ephraim. Life was miserable for the Israelites."
Judges,10,10,"They begged the LORD for help and confessed, “We were unfaithful to you, our LORD . We stopped worshipping you and started worshipping idols of Baal.”"
Judges,12,1,"The men of the Ephraim tribe got together an army and went across the River Jordan to Zaphon to meet with Jephthah. They said, “Why did you go to war with the Ammonites without asking us to help? Just for that, we're going to burn down your house with you inside!”"
Judges,12,2,"“But I did ask for your help,” Jephthah answered. “That was back when the people of Gilead and I were having trouble with the Ammonites, and you wouldn't do a thing to help us."
Judges,12,3,"So when we realized you weren't coming, we risked our lives and attacked the Ammonites. And the LORD let us defeat them. There's no reason for you to come here today to attack me.”"
Judges,12,4,"But the men from Ephraim said, “You people of Gilead are nothing more than refugees from Ephraim. You even live on land that belongs to the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh.” So Jephthah called together the army of Gilead, then they attacked and defeated the army from Ephraim."
Judges,12,5,"The army of Gilead also posted guards at all the places where the soldiers from Ephraim could cross the River Jordan to return to their own land. Whenever one of the men from Ephraim would try to cross the river, the guards would say, “Are you from Ephraim?” “No,” the man would answer, “I'm not from Ephraim.”"
Judges,12,6,"The guards would then tell them to say “Shibboleth”, because they knew that people of Ephraim could say “Sibboleth”, but not “Shibboleth”. If the man said “Sibboleth”, the guards would grab him and kill him there. Altogether, forty-two thousand men from Ephraim were killed in the battle and at the Jordan."
Judges,12,7,"Jephthah was a leader of Israel for six years, before he died and was buried in his home town Mizpah in Gilead."
Judges,12,8,"Ibzan, the next leader of Israel, came from Bethlehem."
Judges,12,9,"He had thirty daughters and thirty sons, and he let them all marry outside his clan. Ibzan was a leader for seven years,"
Judges,12,10,before he died and was buried in Bethlehem.
Judges,12,11,"Elon from the Zebulun tribe was the next leader of Israel. He was a leader for ten years,"
Judges,12,12,before he died and was buried in Aijalon that belonged to the Zebulun tribe.
Judges,13,1,Once again the Israelites started disobeying the LORD . So he let the Philistines take control of Israel for forty years.
Judges,13,2,"Manoah from the tribe of Dan lived in the town of Zorah. His wife was not able to have children,"
Judges,14,1,"One day, Samson went to Timnah, where he saw a Philistine woman."
Judges,14,2,"When he got back home, he told his parents, “I saw a Philistine woman in Timnah, and I want to marry her. Get her for me!”"
Judges,14,3,"His parents answered, “There are a lot of women in our clan and even more in the rest of Israel. Those Philistines are pagans. Why would you want to marry one of their women?” “She looks good to me,” Samson answered. “Get her for me!”"
Judges,14,4,"At that time, the Philistines were in control of Israel, and the LORD wanted to stir up trouble for them. That's why he made Samson desire that woman."
Judges,14,5,"As Samson and his parents reached the vineyards near Timnah, a fierce young lion suddenly roared and attacked Samson."
Judges,14,6,"But the LORD 's Spirit took control of Samson, and with his bare hands he tore the lion apart, as though it had been a young goat. His parents didn't know what he had done, and he didn't tell them."
Judges,14,7,"When they got to Timnah, Samson talked to the woman, and he was sure that she was the one for him."
Judges,14,8,"Later, Samson returned to Timnah for the wedding. And when he came near the place where the lion had attacked, he left the road to see what was left of the lion. He was surprised to see that bees were living in the lion's skeleton, and that they had made some honey."
Judges,14,9,"He scooped up the honey in his hands and ate some of it as he walked along. When he got back to his parents, he gave them some of the honey, and they ate it too. But he didn't tell them he had found the honey in the skeleton of a lion."
Judges,14,10,"While Samson's father went to make the final arrangements with the bride and her family, Samson threw a big party, as grooms usually did."
Judges,14,11,"When the Philistines saw what Samson was like, they told thirty of their young men to stay with him at the party."
Judges,14,12,"Samson told the thirty young men, “This party will last for seven days. Let's make a bet: I'll tell you a riddle, and if you can tell me the right answer before the party is over, I'll give each one of you a shirt and a full change of clothing."
Judges,14,13,"But if you can't tell me the answer, then each of you will have to give me a shirt and a full change of clothing.” “It's a bet!” the Philistines said. “Tell us the riddle.”"
Judges,14,14,"Samson said: Once so strong and mighty— now so sweet and tasty! Three days went by, and the Philistine young men had not come up with the right answer."
Judges,14,15,"Finally, on the seventh day of the party they went to Samson's bride and said, “You had better trick your husband into telling you the answer to his riddle. Have you invited us here just to rob us? If you don't find out the answer, we will burn you and your family to death.”"
Judges,14,16,"Samson's bride went to him and started crying in his arms. “You must really hate me,” she sobbed. “If you loved me at all, you would have told me the answer to your riddle.” “But I haven't even told my parents the answer!” Samson replied. “Why should I tell you?”"
Judges,14,17,"For the entire seven days of the party, she had been whining and trying to get the answer from him. But that seventh day she put so much pressure on Samson that he finally gave in and told her the answer. She went straight to the young men and told them."
Judges,14,18,"Before sunset that day, the men of the town went to Samson with this answer: A lion is the strongest— honey is the sweetest! Samson replied, This answer you have given me doubtless came from my bride-to-be."
Judges,14,19,"Then the LORD 's Spirit took control of Samson. He went to Ashkelon, where he killed thirty men and took their clothing. Samson then gave it to the thirty young men at Timnah and stormed back home to his own family."
Judges,14,20,The father of the bride made Samson's wife marry one of the thirty young men who had been at Samson's party.
Judges,15,1,"Later, during the wheat harvest, Samson went to visit the young woman he thought was still his wife. He brought along a young goat as a gift and said to her father, “I want to go into my wife's bedroom.” “You can't do that,” he replied."
Judges,15,2,"“When you left the way you did, I thought you were divorcing her. So I arranged for her to marry one of the young men who were at your party. But my younger daughter is even prettier, and you can have her as your wife.”"
Judges,15,3,"“This time,” Samson answered, “I have a good reason for really hurting some Philistines.”"
Judges,15,4,Samson went out and caught three hundred foxes and tied them together in pairs with oil-soaked rags around their tails.
Judges,15,5,"Then Samson took the foxes into the Philistine wheat fields that were ready to be harvested. He set the rags on fire and let the foxes go. The wheat fields went up in flames, and so did the stacks of wheat that had already been cut. Even the Philistine vineyards and olive orchards burnt."
Judges,15,6,"Some of the Philistines started asking around, “Who could have done such a thing?” “It was Samson,” someone told them. “He married the daughter of that man in Timnah, but then the man gave Samson's wife to one of the men at the wedding.” The Philistine leaders went to Timnah and burnt to death Samson's wife and her father."
Judges,15,7,"When Samson found out what they had done, he went to them and said, “You killed them! And I won't rest until I get even with you.”"
Judges,15,8,Then Samson started hacking them to pieces with his sword. Samson left Philistia and went to live in the cave at Etam Rock.
Judges,15,9,But it wasn't long before the Philistines invaded Judah and set up a huge army camp at Jawbone.
Judges,15,10,"The people of Judah asked, “Why have you invaded our land?” The Philistines answered, “We've come to get Samson. We're going to do the same things to him that he did to our people.”"
Judges,15,11,"Three thousand men from Judah went to the cave at Etam Rock and said to Samson, “Don't you know that the Philistines rule us, and they will punish us for what you did?” “I was only getting even with them,” Samson replied. “They did the same things to me first.”"
Judges,15,12,"“We came here to tie you up and turn you over to them,” said the men of Judah. “I won't put up a fight,” Samson answered, “but you have to promise not to hurt me yourselves.”"
Judges,16,1,"One day while Samson was in Gaza, he saw a prostitute and went to her house to spend the night."
Judges,16,2,"The people who lived in Gaza found out he was there, and they decided to kill him at sunrise. So they went to the city gate and waited all night in the guardrooms on each side of the gate."
Judges,16,3,"But Samson got up in the middle of the night and went to the town gate. He pulled the gate doors and doorposts out of the wall and put them on his shoulders. Then he carried them all the way to the top of the hill that overlooks Hebron, where he set the doors down, still closed and locked."
Judges,16,4,"Some time later, Samson fell in love with a woman named Delilah, who lived in Sorek Valley."
Judges,16,5,"The Philistine rulers went to Delilah and said, “Trick Samson into telling you what makes him so strong and what can make him weak. Then we can tie him up so he can't get away. If you find out his secret, we will each give you eleven hundred pieces of silver.”"
Judges,16,6,"The next time Samson was at Delilah's house, she asked, “Samson, what makes you so strong? How can I tie you up so you can't get away? Come on, you can tell me.”"
Judges,16,7,"Samson answered, “If someone ties me up with seven new bowstrings that have never been dried, it will make me just as weak as anyone else.”"
Judges,17,1,Micah belonged to the Ephraim tribe and lived in the hill country.
Judges,17,2,"One day he told his mother, “Do you remember those eleven hundred pieces of silver that were stolen from you? I was there when you put a curse on whoever stole them. Well, I'm the one who did it.” His mother answered, “I pray that the LORD will bless you, my son.”"
Judges,18,1,"These things happened before kings ruled Israel. About this time, the tribe of Dan was looking for a place to live. The other tribes had land, but the people of Dan did not really have any to call their own."
Judges,18,2,"The tribe chose five warriors to represent their clans and told them, “Go and find some land where we can live.” The warriors left the area of Zorah and Eshtaol and went into the hill country of Ephraim. One night they stayed at Micah's house,"
Judges,18,3,"because they heard the young Levite talking, and they knew from his accent that he was from the south. They asked him, “What are you doing here? Who brought you here?”"
Judges,18,4,"The Levite replied, “Micah hired me as his priest.” Then he told them how well Micah had treated him."
Judges,18,5,"“Please talk to God for us,” the men said. “Ask God if we will be successful in what we are trying to do.”"
Judges,18,6,"“Don't worry,” answered the priest. “The LORD is pleased with what you are doing.”"
Judges,18,7,"The five men left and went to the town of Laish, whose people were from Sidon, but Sidon was too far away to protect them. Even though their town had no walls, the people thought they were safe from attack. So they had not asked anyone else for protection, which meant that the tribe of Dan could easily take over Laish."
Judges,18,8,"The five men went back to Zorah and Eshtaol, where their relatives asked, “Did you find any land?”"
Judges,19,1,"Before kings ruled Israel, a Levite was living deep in the hill country of the Ephraim tribe. He married a woman from Bethlehem in Judah,"
Judges,19,2,but she was unfaithful and went back to live with her family in Bethlehem. Four months later
Judges,19,3,"her husband decided to try and talk her into coming back. So he went to Bethlehem, taking along a servant and two donkeys. He talked with his wife, and she invited him into her family's home. Her father was glad to see him"
Judges,19,4,"and did not want him to leave. So the man stayed three days, eating and drinking with his father-in-law."
Judges,19,5,"When everyone got up on the fourth day, the Levite started getting ready to go home. But his father-in-law said, “Don't leave until you have a bite to eat. You'll need strength for your journey.”"
Judges,19,6,"The two men sat down together and ate a big meal. “Come on,” the man's father-in-law said. “Stay tonight and have a good time.”"
Judges,19,7,"The Levite tried to leave, but his father-in-law insisted, and he spent one more night."
Judges,19,8,"On the fifth day, the man got up early to leave, but his wife's father said, “You need to keep up your strength! Why don't you leave straight after lunch?” So the two of them started eating."
Judges,19,9,"Finally, the Levite got up from the meal, so he and his wife and servant could leave. “Look,” his father-in-law said, “it's already late afternoon, and if you leave now, you won't get very far before dark. Stay with us one more night and enjoy yourself. Then you can get up early tomorrow morning and start home.”"
Judges,19,10,"But the Levite decided not to spend the night there again. He had the saddles put on his two donkeys, then he and his wife and servant travelled as far as Jebus, which is now called Jerusalem."
Judges,19,11,"It was beginning to get dark, and the man's servant said, “Let's stop and spend the night in this town where the Jebusites live.”"
Judges,19,12,"“No,” the Levite answered. “They aren't Israelites, and I refuse to spend the night there. We'll stop for the night at Gibeah,"
Judges,19,13,because we can make it to Gibeah or perhaps even to Ramah before dark.”
Judges,19,14,They walked on and reached Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin just after sunset.
Judges,19,15,"They left the road and went into Gibeah. But the Levite couldn't find a house where anyone would let them spend the night, and they sat down in the open area just inside the town gates."
Judges,19,16,"Soon an old man came in through the gates on his way home from working in the fields. Most of the people who lived in Gibeah belonged to the tribe of Benjamin, but this man was originally from the hill country of Ephraim."
Judges,19,17,He noticed that the Levite was just in town to spend the night. “Where are you going?” the old man asked. “Where did you come from?”
Judges,19,18,"“We've come from Bethlehem in Judah,” the Levite answered. “We went there on a visit. Now we're going to the place where the LORD is worshipped, and later we will return to our home in the hill country of Ephraim. But no one here will let us spend the night in their home."
Judges,19,19,"We brought food for our donkeys and bread and wine for ourselves, so we don't need anything except a place to sleep.”"
Judges,19,20,"The old man said, “You are welcome to spend the night in my home and to be my guest, but don't stay out here!”"
Judges,19,21,The old man brought them into his house and fed their donkeys. Then he and his guests washed their feet and began eating and drinking.
Judges,19,22,"They were having a good time, when some worthless men of that town surrounded the house and started banging on the door and shouting, “A man came to your house tonight. Send him out, so we can have sex with him!”"
Judges,19,23,"The old man went outside and said, “My friends, please don't commit such a horrible crime against a man who is a guest in my house."
Judges,19,24,"Let me send out my daughter instead. She's a virgin. And I'll even send out the man's wife. You can rape them or do whatever else you want, but please don't do such a horrible thing to this man.”"
Judges,19,25,"The men refused to listen, so the Levite grabbed his wife and shoved her outside. The men raped her and abused her all night long. Finally, they let her go just before sunrise,"
Judges,19,26,and it was almost daybreak when she went back to the house where her husband was staying. She collapsed at the door and lay there until sunrise.
Judges,19,27,"About that time, her husband woke up and got ready to leave. He opened the door and went outside, where he found his wife lying at the door with her hands on the doorstep."
Judges,19,28,“Get up!” he said. “It's time to leave.” But his wife didn't move. He lifted her body on to his donkey and left.
Judges,19,29,"When he got home, he took a butcher's knife and cut her body into twelve pieces. Then he told some messengers, “Take one piece to each tribe of Israel"
Judges,19,30,"and ask everyone if anything like this has ever happened since Israel left Egypt. Tell them to think about it, talk it over, and tell us what should be done.” Everyone who saw a piece of the body said, “This is horrible! Nothing like this has ever happened since the day Israel left Egypt.”"
Judges,21,1,"When the Israelites had met at Mizpah before the war with Benjamin, they had made this sacred promise: “None of us will ever let our daughters marry any man from Benjamin.”"
Judges,21,2,"After the war with Benjamin, the Israelites went to the place of worship at Bethel and sat there until sunset. They cried loudly and bitterly"
Judges,21,3,"and prayed, “Our LORD , you are the God of Israel. Why did you let this happen? Now one of our tribes is almost gone.”"
Judges,21,4,"Early the next morning, the Israelites built an altar and offered sacrifices to please the LORD and to ask his blessing."
Judges,21,5,"Then they asked each other, “Did any of the tribes of Israel fail to come to the place of worship? We made a sacred promise that anyone who didn't come to the meeting at Mizpah would be put to death.”"
Judges,21,6,"The Israelites were sad about what had happened to the Benjamin tribe, and they said, “One of our tribes was almost wiped out."
Judges,21,7,"Only a few men of Benjamin weren't killed in the war. We need to get wives for them, so the tribe won't completely disappear. But how can we do that, after promising in the LORD 's name that we wouldn't let them marry any of our daughters?”"
Ruth,3,1,"One day, Naomi said to Ruth: It's time I found you a husband, who will give you a home and take care of you."
Ruth,3,2,"You have been picking up grain beside the women who work for Boaz, and you know he is a relative of ours. Tonight he will be threshing the grain."
Ruth,3,3,"Now take a bath and put on some perfume, then dress in your best clothes. Go where he is working, but don't let him see you until he has finished eating and drinking."
Ruth,3,4,"Watch where he goes to spend the night, then when he is asleep, lift the cover and lie down at his feet. He will tell you what to do."
Ruth,3,5,"Ruth answered, “I'll do whatever you say.”"
Ruth,3,6,She went out to the place where Boaz was working and did what Naomi had told her.
Ruth,3,7,"After Boaz finished eating and drinking and was feeling happy, he went over and fell asleep near the pile of grain. Ruth slipped over quietly. She lifted the cover and lay down near his feet."
Ruth,3,8,"In the middle of the night, Boaz suddenly woke up and was shocked to see a woman lying at his feet."
Ruth,3,9,"“Who are you?” he asked. “Sir, I am Ruth,” she answered, “and you are the relative who is supposed to take care of me. So spread the edge of your cover over me.”"
Ruth,3,10,"Boaz replied: The LORD bless you! This shows how truly loyal you are to your family. You could have looked for a younger man, either rich or poor, but you didn't."
Ruth,3,11,"Don't worry, I'll do what you have asked. You are respected by everyone in town."
Ruth,3,12,"It's true that I am one of the relatives who is supposed to take care of you, but there is someone who is an even closer relative."
Ruth,3,13,"Stay here until morning, then I will find out if he is willing to look after you. If he isn't, I promise by the living God to do it myself. Now go back to sleep until morning."
Ruth,3,14,"Ruth lay down again, but she got up before daylight, because Boaz did not want anyone to know she had been there."
Ruth,3,15,"Then he told her to spread out her cape. And he filled it with a lot of grain and placed it on her shoulder. When Ruth got back to town,"
Ruth,3,16,"Naomi asked her what had happened, and Ruth told her everything."
Ruth,3,17,"She also said, “Boaz gave me this grain, because he didn't want me to come back without something for you.”"
Ruth,3,18,"Naomi replied, “Just be patient and don't worry about what will happen. He won't rest until everything is settled today!”"
Ruth,4,1,"Meanwhile, Boaz had gone to the meeting place at the town gate and was sitting there when the other close relative came by. So Boaz invited him to come over and sit down, and he did."
Ruth,4,2,"Then Boaz got ten of the town leaders and also asked them to sit down. After they had sat down,"
Ruth,4,3,he said to the man: Naomi has come back from Moab and is selling the land that belonged to her husband Elimelech.
Ruth,4,4,"I am telling you about this, since you are his closest relative and have the right to buy the property. If you want it, you can buy it now. These ten men and the others standing here can be witnesses. But if you don't want the property, let me know, because I am next in line. The man replied, “I will buy it!”"
Ruth,4,5,"“If you do buy it from Naomi,” Boaz told him, “you must also marry Ruth. Then if you have a son by her, the property will stay in the family of Ruth's first husband.”"
Ruth,4,6,"The man answered, “If that's the case, I don't want to buy it! That would make problems with the property I already own. You may buy it yourself, because I cannot.”"
Ruth,4,7,"To make a sale legal in those days, one person would take off a sandal and give it to the other."
Ruth,4,8,"So after the man had agreed to let Boaz buy the property, he took off one of his sandals and handed it to Boaz."
Ruth,4,9,"Boaz told the town leaders and everyone else: All of you are witnesses that today I have bought from Naomi the property that belonged to Elimelech and his two sons, Chilion and Mahlon."
Ruth,4,10,"You are also witnesses that I have agreed to marry Mahlon's widow Ruth, the Moabite woman. This will keep the property in his family's name, and he will be remembered in this town."
Ruth,4,11,"The town leaders and the others standing there said: We are witnesses to this. And we pray that the LORD will give your wife many children, just as he did Leah and Rachel, the wives of Jacob. May you be a rich man in the tribe of Ephrath and an important man in Bethlehem."
Ruth,4,12,"May the children you have by this young woman make your family as famous as the family of Perez, the son of Tamar and Judah."
Ruth,4,13,"Boaz married Ruth, and the LORD blessed her with a son."
Ruth,4,14,"After his birth, the women said to Naomi: Praise the LORD ! Today he has given you a grandson to take care of you. We pray that the boy will grow up to be famous everywhere in Israel."
Ruth,4,15,"He will make you happy and take care of you in your old age, because he is the son of your daughter-in-law. And she loves you more than seven sons of your own would love you."
Ruth,4,16,Naomi loved the boy and took good care of him.
Ruth,4,17,"The neighbourhood women named him Obed, but they called him “Naomi's Boy”. When Obed grew up he had a son named Jesse, who later became the father of King David."
1 Samuel,1,1,"Elkanah lived in Ramah, a town in the hill country of Ephraim. His great-great-grandfather was Zuph, so Elkanah was a member of the Zuph clan of the Ephraim tribe. Elkanah's father was Jeroham, his grandfather was Elihu, and his great-grandfather was Tohu."
1 Samuel,1,2,"Elkanah had two wives, Hannah and Peninnah. Although Peninnah had children, Hannah did not have any."
1 Samuel,1,3,"Once a year Elkanah travelled from his home town to Shiloh, where he worshipped the LORD All-Powerful and offered sacrifices. Eli was the LORD 's priest there, and his two sons Hophni and Phinehas served with him as priests."
1 Samuel,1,4,"Whenever Elkanah offered a sacrifice, he gave some of the meat to Peninnah and some to each of her sons and daughters."
1 Samuel,1,5,"But he gave Hannah even more, because he loved Hannah very much, even though the LORD had kept her from having children of her own."
1 Samuel,1,6,"Peninnah liked to make Hannah feel miserable about not having any children,"
1 Samuel,1,7,"especially when the family went to the house of the LORD each year. One day, Elkanah was there offering a sacrifice, when Hannah began crying and refused to eat."
1 Samuel,1,8,"So Elkanah asked, “Hannah, why are you crying? Why won't you eat? Why do you feel so bad? Don't I mean more to you than ten sons?”"
1 Samuel,1,9,"When the sacrifice had been offered, and they had eaten the meal, Hannah got up and went to pray. Eli was sitting in his chair near the door to the place of worship."
1 Samuel,1,10,"Hannah was brokenhearted and was crying as she prayed,"
1 Samuel,1,11,"“ LORD All-Powerful, I am your servant, but I am so miserable! Please let me have a son. I will give him to you for as long as he lives, and his hair will never be cut.”"
1 Samuel,2,1,"Hannah prayed: You make me strong and happy, LORD. You rescued me. Now I can be glad and laugh at my enemies."
1 Samuel,2,2,No other god is like you. We're safer with you than on a high mountain.
1 Samuel,2,3,"I can tell those proud people, “Stop your boasting! Nothing is hidden from the LORD, and he judges what we do.”"
1 Samuel,2,4,"Our LORD , you break the bows of warriors, but you give strength to everyone who stumbles."
1 Samuel,2,5,"People who once had plenty to eat must now hire themselves out for only a piece of bread. But you give the hungry more than enough to eat. A woman did not have a child, and you gave her seven, but a woman who had many was left with none."
1 Samuel,2,6,"You take away life, and you give life. You send people down to the world of the dead and bring them back again."
1 Samuel,2,7,"Our LORD , you are the one who makes us rich or poor. You put some in high positions and bring disgrace on others."
1 Samuel,2,8,"You lift the poor and homeless out of the rubbish dump and give them places of honour in royal palaces. You set the world on foundations, and they belong to you."
1 Samuel,2,9,"You protect your loyal people, but everyone who is evil will die in darkness. We cannot win a victory by our own strength."
1 Samuel,2,10,"Our LORD , those who attack you will be broken in pieces when you fight back with thunder from heaven. You will judge the whole earth and give power and strength to your chosen king."
1 Samuel,2,11,"Elkanah and Hannah went back home to Ramah, but the boy Samuel stayed to help Eli serve the LORD."
1 Samuel,4,1,"Then Samuel would speak to the whole nation of Israel. One day the Israelites went out to fight the Philistines. They set up camp near Ebenezer, and the Philistines camped at Aphek."
1 Samuel,4,2,The Philistines made a fierce attack. They defeated the Israelites and killed about four thousand of them.
1 Samuel,4,3,"The Israelite army returned to their camp, and the leaders said, “Why did the LORD let us lose to the Philistines today? Let's get the sacred chest where the LORD 's agreement with Israel is kept. Then the LORD will help us and rescue us from our enemies.”"
1 Samuel,4,4,"The army sent some soldiers to bring back the sacred chest from Shiloh, because the LORD All-Powerful has his throne on the winged creatures on top of the chest. As Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas,"
1 Samuel,4,5,"brought the chest into camp, the army cheered so loudly that the ground shook."
1 Samuel,4,6,"The Philistines heard the noise and said, “What are those Hebrews shouting about?” When the Philistines learnt that the sacred chest had been brought into the camp,"
1 Samuel,4,7,they were scared to death and said: The gods have come into their camp. Now we're in real trouble! Nothing like this has ever happened to us before.
1 Samuel,4,8,We're in big trouble! Who can save us from these powerful gods? They're the same gods who made all those horrible things happen to the Egyptians in the desert.
1 Samuel,4,9,"Philistines, be brave and fight hard! If you don't, those Hebrews will rule us, just as we've been ruling them. Fight and don't be afraid."
1 Samuel,4,10,"The Philistines did fight. They killed thirty thousand Israelite soldiers, and all the rest ran off to their homes."
1 Samuel,4,11,"Hophni and Phinehas were killed, and the sacred chest was captured."
1 Samuel,4,12,That same day a soldier from the tribe of Benjamin ran from the battlefront to Shiloh. He had torn his clothes and put earth on his head to show his sorrow.
1 Samuel,4,13,"He went into town and told the news about the battle, and everyone started crying. Eli was afraid that something might happen to the sacred chest. So he was sitting on his chair beside the road, just waiting."
1 Samuel,5,1,The Philistines took the sacred chest from near Ebenezer to the town of Ashdod.
1 Samuel,5,2,"They brought it into the temple of their god Dagon and put it next to the statue of Dagon, which they worshipped."
1 Samuel,5,3,"When the people of Ashdod got up early the next morning, they found the statue lying face down on the floor in front of the sacred chest. They put the statue back where it belonged."
1 Samuel,5,4,"But early the next morning, it had fallen over again and was lying face down on the floor in front of the chest. The body of the statue was still in one piece, but its head and both hands had broken off and were lying on the stone floor in the doorway."
1 Samuel,5,5,This is the reason the priests and everyone else step over that part of the doorway when they enter the temple of Dagon in Ashdod.
1 Samuel,5,6,"The LORD caused a lot of trouble for the people of Ashdod and their neighbours. He made sores break out all over their bodies, and everyone was in a panic."
1 Samuel,5,7,"Finally, they said, “The God of Israel did this. He is the one who caused all this trouble for us and our god Dagon. We've got to get rid of this chest.”"
1 Samuel,5,8,"The people of Ashdod called all the Philistine rulers to Ashdod, and they asked them, “What can we do with the sacred chest that belongs to the God of Israel?” “Send it to Gath,” the rulers answered. But after they took it there,"
1 Samuel,5,9,"the LORD made sores break out on everyone in town. The people of Gath were frightened,"
1 Samuel,5,10,"so they sent the sacred chest to Ekron. But before they could take it through the town gates, the people of Ekron started screaming, “They've brought the sacred chest that belongs to the God of Israel! It will kill us and our families too!”"
1 Samuel,5,11,"The people of Ekron called for another meeting of the Philistine rulers and told them, “Send this chest back where it belongs. Then it won't kill us.” Everyone was in a panic, because God was causing a lot of people to die,"
1 Samuel,5,12,and those who had survived were suffering from the sores. They all cried to their gods for help.
1 Samuel,6,1,"After the sacred chest had been in Philistia for seven months,"
1 Samuel,6,2,"the Philistines called in their priests and fortune-tellers, and asked, “What should we do with this sacred chest? Tell us how to send it back where it belongs!”"
1 Samuel,6,3,"“Don't send it back without a gift,” the priests and fortune-tellers answered. “Send along something to Israel's God to make up for taking the chest in the first place. Then you will be healed, and you will find out why the LORD was causing you so much trouble.”"
1 Samuel,6,4,"“What should we send?” the Philistines asked. The priests and fortune-tellers answered: There are five Philistine rulers, and they all have the same disease that you have."
1 Samuel,6,5,"So make five gold models of the sores and five gold models of the rats that are wiping out your crops. If you honour the God of Israel with this gift, perhaps he will stop causing trouble for you and your gods and your crops."
1 Samuel,6,6,"Don't be like the Egyptians and their king. They were stubborn, but when Israel's God had finished with them, they had to let Israel go."
1 Samuel,6,7,"Get a new cart and two cows that have young calves and that have never pulled a cart. Hitch the cows to the cart, but take the calves back to their barn."
1 Samuel,6,8,Then put the chest on the cart. Put the gold rats and sores into a bag and put it on the cart next to the chest. Then send it on its way.
1 Samuel,6,9,"Watch to see if the chest goes on up the road to the Israelite town of Beth-Shemesh. If it goes back to its own country, you will know that it was the LORD who made us suffer so badly. But if the chest doesn't go back to its own country, then the LORD had nothing to do with the disease that hit us—it was simply bad luck."
1 Samuel,6,10,"The Philistines followed their advice. They hitched up the two cows to the cart, but they kept their calves in a barn."
1 Samuel,6,11,"Then they put the chest on the cart, along with the bag that had the gold rats and sores in it."
1 Samuel,6,12,"The cows went straight up the road towards Beth-Shemesh, mooing as they went. The Philistine rulers followed them until they got close to Beth-Shemesh."
1 Samuel,6,13,"The people of Beth-Shemesh were harvesting their wheat in the valley. When they looked up and saw the chest, they were so happy that they stopped working and started celebrating."
1 Samuel,7,1,"The people of Kiriath-Jearim got the chest and took it to Abinadab's house, which was on a hill in their town. They chose his son Eleazar to take care of it,"
1 Samuel,7,2,and it stayed there for twenty years. During this time everyone in Israel was very sad and begged the LORD for help.
1 Samuel,7,3,"One day, Samuel told all the people of Israel, “If you really want to turn back to the LORD , then prove it. Get rid of your foreign idols, including the ones of the goddess Astarte. Turn to the LORD with all your heart and worship only him. Then he will rescue you from the Philistines.”"
1 Samuel,7,4,The people got rid of their idols of Baal and Astarte and began worshipping only the LORD.
1 Samuel,7,5,"Then Samuel said, “Tell everyone in Israel to meet together at Mizpah, and I will pray to the LORD for you.”"
1 Samuel,7,6,"The Israelites met together at Mizpah with Samuel as their leader. They drew water from the well and poured it out as an offering to the LORD . On that same day they went without eating to show their sorrow, and they confessed they had been unfaithful to the LORD."
1 Samuel,7,7,"When the Philistine rulers found out about the meeting at Mizpah, they sent an army there to attack the people of Israel. The Israelites were afraid when they heard that the Philistines were coming."
1 Samuel,7,8,“Don't stop praying!” they told Samuel. “Ask the LORD our God to rescue us.”
1 Samuel,9,1,"Kish was a wealthy man who belonged to the tribe of Benjamin. His father was Abiel, his grandfather was Zeror, his great-grandfather was Becorath, and his great-great-grandfather was Aphiah."
1 Samuel,9,2,"Kish had a son named Saul, who was better looking and more than a head taller than anyone else in all Israel."
1 Samuel,9,3,"Kish owned some donkeys, but they had run off. So he told Saul, “Take one of the servants and go and look for the donkeys.”"
1 Samuel,9,4,"Saul and the servant went through the hill country of Ephraim and the territory of Shalishah, but they could not find the donkeys. Then they went through the territories of Shaalim and Benjamin, but still there was no sign of the donkeys."
1 Samuel,9,5,"Finally they came to the territory where the clan of Zuph lived. “Let's go back home,” Saul told his servant. “If we don't go back soon, my father will stop worrying about the donkeys and start worrying about us!”"
1 Samuel,9,6,“Wait!” the servant answered. “There's a man of God who lives in a town near here. He's amazing! Everything he says comes true. Let's talk to him. Perhaps he can tell us where to look.”
1 Samuel,9,7,"Saul said, “How can we talk to the prophet when I don't have anything to give him? We don't even have any bread left in our sacks. What can we give him?”"
1 Samuel,9,8,"“I have a small piece of silver,” the servant answered. “We can give him that, and then he will tell us where to look for the donkeys.”"
1 Samuel,10,1,Samuel took a small jar of olive oil and poured it on Saul's head. Then he kissed Saul and told him: The LORD has chosen you to be the leader and ruler of his people.
1 Samuel,10,2,"When you leave me today, you'll meet two men near Rachel's tomb at Zelzah in the territory of Benjamin. They'll tell you, “The donkeys you've been looking for have been found. Your father has forgotten about them, and now he's worrying about you! He's wondering how he can find you.”"
1 Samuel,10,3,"Go on from there until you reach the big oak tree at Tabor, where you'll meet three men on their way to worship God at Bethel. One of them will be leading three young goats, another will be carrying three round loaves of bread, and the last one will be carrying a clay jar of wine."
1 Samuel,10,4,"After they greet you, they'll give you two loaves of bread."
1 Samuel,10,5,"Next, go to Gibeah, where the Philistines have an army camp. As you're going into the town, you'll meet a group of prophets coming down from the place of worship. They'll be going along prophesying while others are walking in front of them, playing small harps, small drums, and flutes."
1 Samuel,10,6,The Spirit of the LORD will suddenly take control of you. You'll become a different person and start prophesying along with them.
1 Samuel,10,7,"After these things happen, do whatever you think is right! God will help you."
1 Samuel,10,8,"Then you should go to Gilgal. I'll come a little later, so wait for me. It may even take a week for me to get there, but when I come, I'll offer sacrifices and offerings to the LORD . I'll also tell you what to do next."
1 Samuel,10,9,"As Saul turned around to leave Samuel, God made Saul feel like a different person. That same day, everything happened just as Samuel had said."
1 Samuel,10,10,"When Saul arrived at Gibeah, a group of prophets met him. The Spirit of God suddenly took control of him, and there in the middle of the group he began prophesying."
1 Samuel,10,11,"Some people who had known Saul for a long time saw that he was speaking and behaving like a prophet. They said to each other, “What's happened? How can Saul be a prophet?”"
1 Samuel,10,12,"“Why not?” one of them answered. “Saul has as much right to be a prophet as anyone else!” That's why everyone started saying, “How can Saul be a prophet?”"
1 Samuel,10,13,"After Saul stopped prophesying, he went to the place of worship."
1 Samuel,10,14,"Later, Saul's uncle asked him, “Where have you been?” Saul answered, “Looking for the donkeys. We couldn't find them, so we went to talk with Samuel.”"
1 Samuel,10,15,“And what did he tell you?” Saul's uncle asked.
1 Samuel,10,16,"Saul answered, “He told us the donkeys had been found.” But Saul didn't mention that Samuel had chosen him to be king."
1 Samuel,10,17,Samuel sent messengers to tell the Israelites to come to Mizpah and meet with the LORD.
1 Samuel,10,18,"When everyone had arrived, Samuel said: The LORD God of Israel told me to remind you that he had rescued you from the Egyptians and from the other nations that abused you."
1 Samuel,10,19,God has rescued you from your troubles and hard times. But you have rejected your God and have asked for a king. Now each tribe and clan must come near the place of worship so the LORD can choose a king.
1 Samuel,10,20,"Samuel brought each tribe, one after the other, to the altar, and the LORD chose the Benjamin tribe."
1 Samuel,10,21,"Next, Samuel brought each clan of Benjamin there, and the LORD chose the Matri clan. Finally, Saul the son of Kish was chosen. But when they looked for him, he was nowhere to be found."
1 Samuel,10,22,"The people prayed, “Our LORD , is Saul here?” “Yes,” the LORD answered, “he is hiding behind the baggage.”"
1 Samuel,10,23,The people ran and got Saul and brought him into the middle of the crowd. He was more than a head taller than anyone else.
1 Samuel,10,24,"“Look closely at the man the LORD has chosen!” Samuel told the crowd. “There is no one like him!” The crowd shouted, “Long live the king!”"
1 Samuel,10,25,Samuel explained the rights and duties of a king and wrote them all in a book. He put the book in a temple building at one of the places where the LORD was worshipped. Then Samuel sent everyone home.
1 Samuel,10,26,"God had encouraged some young men to become followers of Saul, and when he returned to his home town of Gibeah, they went with him."
1 Samuel,10,27,"But some worthless fools said, “How can someone like Saul rescue us from our enemies?” They did not want Saul to be their king, and so they didn't bring him any gifts. But Saul kept calm."
1 Samuel,11,1,"About this time, King Nahash of Ammon came with his army and surrounded the town of Jabesh in Gilead. The people who lived there told Nahash, “If you will sign a peace treaty with us, you can be our ruler, and we will pay taxes to you.”"
1 Samuel,11,2,"Nahash answered, “Certainly, I'll sign a treaty! But not before I insult Israel by putting out the right eye of every man who lives in Jabesh.”"
1 Samuel,11,3,"The town leaders said, “Give us seven days so we can send messengers everywhere in Israel to ask for help. If no one comes here to save us, we will surrender to you.”"
1 Samuel,11,4,"Some of the messengers went to Gibeah, Saul's home town. They told what was happening at Jabesh, and everyone in Gibeah started crying."
1 Samuel,11,5,"Just then, Saul came in from the fields, walking behind his oxen. “Why is everyone crying?” Saul asked. They told him what the men from Jabesh had said."
1 Samuel,11,6,Then the Spirit of God suddenly took control of Saul and made him furious.
1 Samuel,11,7,"Saul killed two of his oxen, cut them up in pieces, and gave the pieces to the messengers. He told them to show the pieces to everyone in Israel and say, “Saul and Samuel are getting an army together. Come and join them. If you don't, this is what will happen to your oxen!” The LORD made the people of Israel terribly afraid. So all the men came together"
1 Samuel,11,8,at Bezek. Saul had them organized and counted. There were three hundred thousand from Israel and thirty thousand from Judah.
1 Samuel,11,9,Saul and his officers sent the messengers back to Jabesh with this promise: “We will rescue you tomorrow afternoon.” The messengers went back to the people at Jabesh and told them that they were going to be rescued. Everyone was encouraged!
1 Samuel,11,10,"So they told the Ammonites, “We will surrender to you tomorrow, and then you can do whatever you want to.”"
1 Samuel,11,11,"The next day, Saul divided his army into three groups and attacked before daylight. They started killing Ammonites and kept it up until afternoon. A few Ammonites managed to escape, but they were scattered far from each other."
1 Samuel,11,12,"The Israelite soldiers went to Samuel and demanded, “Where are the men who said they didn't want Saul to be king? Bring them to us, and we will put them to death!”"
1 Samuel,11,13,"“No you won't!” Saul told them. “The LORD rescued Israel today, and no one will be put to death.”"
1 Samuel,11,14,“Come on!” Samuel said. “Let's go to Gilgal and make an agreement that Saul will continue to be our king.”
1 Samuel,11,15,"Everyone went to the place of worship at Gilgal, where they agreed that Saul would be their king. Saul and the people sacrificed animals to ask for the LORD 's blessing, and they had a big celebration."
1 Samuel,12,1,"Samuel told the Israelites: I have given you a king, just as you asked."
1 Samuel,12,2,"You have seen how I have led you ever since I was a young man. I'm already old. My hair is grey, and my own sons are grown up. Now you must see how well your king will lead you."
1 Samuel,12,3,"Let me ask this. Have I ever taken anyone's ox or donkey or forced you to give me anything? Have I ever hurt anyone or taken a bribe to give an unfair decision? Answer me so the LORD and his chosen king can hear you. And if I have done any of these things, I will give it all back."
1 Samuel,12,4,"“No,” the Israelites answered. “You've never cheated us in any way!”"
1 Samuel,12,5,"Samuel said, “The LORD and his chosen king are witnesses to what you have said.” “That's true,” they replied."
1 Samuel,12,6,Then Samuel told them: The LORD brought your ancestors out of Egypt and chose Moses and Aaron to be your leaders.
1 Samuel,12,7,"Now the LORD will be your judge. So stand here and listen, while I remind you how often the LORD has saved you and your ancestors from your enemies."
1 Samuel,12,8,"After Jacob went to Egypt, your ancestors cried out to the LORD for help, and he sent Moses and Aaron. They led your ancestors out of Egypt and settled them in this land."
1 Samuel,12,9,"But your ancestors forgot the LORD , so he let them be defeated by the Philistines, the king of Moab, and Sisera, the commander of Hazor's army."
1 Samuel,12,10,"Again your ancestors cried out to the LORD for help. They said, “We have sinned! We stopped worshipping you, our LORD , and started worshipping Baal and Astarte. But now, if you rescue us from our enemies, we will worship you.”"
1 Samuel,12,11,"The LORD sent Gideon, Bedan, Jephthah, and Samuel to rescue you from your enemies, and you didn't have to worry about being attacked."
1 Samuel,12,12,"Then you saw that King Nahash of Ammon was going to attack you. And even though the LORD your God is your king, you told me, “This time it's different. We want a king to rule us!”"
1 Samuel,12,13,"You asked for a king, and you chose one. Now he stands here where all of you can see him. But it was really the LORD who made him your king."
1 Samuel,12,14,"If you and your king want to be followers of the LORD , you must worship him and do what he says. Don't be stubborn!"
1 Samuel,12,15,"If you're stubborn and refuse to obey the LORD , he will turn against you and your king."
1 Samuel,12,16,Just stand here and watch the LORD show his mighty power.
1 Samuel,12,17,"Isn't this the dry season? I'm going to ask the LORD to send a thunderstorm. When you see it, you will realize how wrong you were to ask for a king."
1 Samuel,12,18,"Samuel prayed, and that same day the LORD sent a thunderstorm. Everyone was afraid of the LORD and of Samuel."
1 Samuel,12,19,"They told Samuel, “Please, pray to the LORD your God for us! We don't want to die. We have sinned many times in the past, and we were very wrong to ask for a king.”"
1 Samuel,12,20,"Samuel answered: Even though what you did was wrong, you don't need to be afraid. But you must always follow the LORD and worship him with all your heart."
1 Samuel,12,21,"Don't worship idols! They don't have any power, and they can't help you or save you when you're in trouble."
1 Samuel,12,22,But the LORD has chosen you to be his own people. He will always take care of you so that everyone will know how great he is.
1 Samuel,12,23,I would be disobeying the LORD if I stopped praying for you! I will always teach you how to live right.
1 Samuel,12,24,You also must obey the LORD —you must worship him with all your heart and remember the great things he has done for you.
1 Samuel,12,25,"But if you and your king do evil, the LORD will wipe you out."
1 Samuel,13,1,"Saul was a young man when he became king, and he ruled Israel for two years."
1 Samuel,13,2,Then he chose three thousand men from Israel to be full-time soldiers and sent everyone else home. Two thousand of these troops stayed with him in the hills around Michmash and Bethel. The other thousand were stationed with Jonathan at Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin.
1 Samuel,13,3,"Jonathan led an attack on the Philistine army camp at Geba. The Philistine camp was destroyed, but the other Philistines heard what had happened. Then Saul told his messengers, “Go to every village in the country. Give a signal with the trumpet, and when the people come together, tell them what has happened.”"
1 Samuel,13,4,"The messengers then said to the people of Israel, “Saul has destroyed the Philistine army camp at Geba. Now the Philistines really hate Israel, so every town and village must send men to join Saul's army at Gilgal.”"
1 Samuel,13,5,"The Philistines called their army together to fight Israel. They had three thousand chariots, six thousand cavalry, and as many foot soldiers as there are grains of sand on the beach. They went to Michmash and set up camp there east of Beth-Aven."
1 Samuel,13,6,"The Israelite army realized that they were outnumbered and were going to lose the battle. Some of the Israelite men hid in caves or in clumps of bushes, and some ran to places where they could hide among large rocks. Others hid in tombs or in deep dry pits."
1 Samuel,13,7,"Still others went to Gad and Gilead on the other side of the River Jordan. Saul stayed at Gilgal. His soldiers were shaking with fear,"
1 Samuel,13,8,"and they were starting to run off and leave him. Saul waited there seven days, just as Samuel had ordered him to do, but Samuel did not come."
1 Samuel,13,9,"Finally, Saul commanded, “Bring me some animals, so we can offer sacrifices to please the LORD and ask for his help.” Saul killed one of the animals,"
1 Samuel,13,10,"and just as he was placing it on the altar, Samuel arrived. Saul went out to welcome him."
1 Samuel,13,11,"“What have you done?” Samuel asked. Saul answered, “My soldiers were leaving in all directions, and you didn't come when you were supposed to. The Philistines were gathering at Michmash,"
1 Samuel,13,12,"and I was worried that they would attack me here at Gilgal. I hadn't offered a sacrifice to ask for the LORD 's help, so I forced myself to offer a sacrifice on the altar fire.”"
1 Samuel,13,13,"“That was stupid!” Samuel said. “You didn't obey the LORD your God. If you had obeyed him, someone from your family would always have been king of Israel."
1 Samuel,13,14,"But no, you disobeyed, and so the LORD won't choose anyone else from your family to be king. In fact, he has already chosen the one he wants to be the next leader of his people.”"
1 Samuel,13,15,"Then Samuel left Gilgal. Part of Saul's army had not deserted him, and he led them to Gibeah in Benjamin to join his other troops. Then he counted them and found that he still had six hundred men."
1 Samuel,13,16,"Saul, Jonathan, and their army set up camp at Geba in Benjamin. The Philistine army was camped at Michmash."
1 Samuel,13,17,Each day they sent out patrols to attack and rob villages and then destroy them. One patrol would go north along the road to Ophrah in the region of Shual.
1 Samuel,13,18,Another patrol would go west along the road to Beth-Horon. A third patrol would go east towards the desert on the road to the ridge that overlooks Zeboim Valley.
1 Samuel,13,19,"The Philistines would not allow any Israelites to learn how to make iron tools. “If we allowed that,” they said, “those worthless Israelites would make swords and spears.”"
1 Samuel,15,1,"One day, Samuel told Saul: The LORD made me choose you to be king of his people, Israel. Now listen to this message from the LORD:"
1 Samuel,15,2,"“When the Israelites were on their way out of Egypt, the nation of Amalek attacked them. I am the LORD All-Powerful, and now I am going to make Amalek pay!"
1 Samuel,15,3,"“Go and attack the Amalekites! Destroy them and all their possessions. Don't have any pity. Kill their men, women, children, and even their babies. Slaughter their cattle, sheep, camels, and donkeys.”"
1 Samuel,15,4,"Saul sent messengers who told every town and village to send men to join the army at Telaim. There were two hundred and ten thousand troops in all, and ten thousand of these were from Judah. Saul organized them,"
1 Samuel,15,5,"then led them to a valley near one of the towns in Amalek, where they got ready to make a surprise attack."
1 Samuel,15,6,"Some Kenites lived nearby, and Saul told them, “Your people were kind to our nation when we left Egypt, and I don't want you to get killed when I wipe out the Amalekites. Leave here and stay away from them.” The Kenites left,"
1 Samuel,15,7,"and Saul attacked the Amalekites from Havilah to Shur, which is just east of Egypt."
1 Samuel,15,8,Every Amalekite was killed except King Agag.
1 Samuel,15,9,"Saul and his army let Agag live, and they also spared the best sheep and cattle. They didn't want to destroy anything of value, so they only killed the animals that were worthless or weak."
1 Samuel,15,10,"The LORD told Samuel,"
1 Samuel,15,11,"“Saul has stopped obeying me, and I'm sorry that I made him king.” Samuel was angry, and he cried out in prayer to the LORD all night."
1 Samuel,15,12,"Early the next morning he went to talk with Saul. Someone told him, “Saul went to Carmel, where he had a monument built so everyone would remember his victory. Then he left for Gilgal.”"
1 Samuel,15,13,"Samuel finally caught up with Saul, and Saul told him, “I hope the LORD will bless you! I have done what the LORD told me.”"
1 Samuel,15,14,"“Then why,” Samuel asked, “do I hear sheep and cattle?”"
1 Samuel,15,15,"“The army took them from the Amalekites,” Saul explained. “They kept the best sheep and cattle, so they could sacrifice them to the LORD your God. But we destroyed everything else.”"
1 Samuel,15,16,"“Stop!” Samuel said. “Let me tell you what the LORD told me last night.” “All right,” Saul answered."
1 Samuel,15,17,"Samuel continued, “You may not think you're very important, but the LORD chose you to be king, and you are in charge of the tribes of Israel."
1 Samuel,15,18,"When the LORD sent you on this mission, he told you to wipe out those worthless Amalekites."
1 Samuel,15,19,Why didn't you listen to the LORD ? Why did you keep the animals and make him angry?”
1 Samuel,15,20,"“But I did listen to the LORD !” Saul answered. “He sent me on a mission, and I went. I captured King Agag and destroyed his nation."
1 Samuel,15,21,All the animals were going to be destroyed anyway. That's why the army brought the best sheep and cattle to Gilgal as sacrifices to the LORD your God.”
1 Samuel,15,22,"“Tell me,” Samuel said. “Does the LORD really want sacrifices and offerings? No! He doesn't want your sacrifices. He wants you to obey him."
1 Samuel,15,23,"Rebelling against God or disobeying him because you are proud is just as bad as worshipping idols or asking them for advice. You refused to do what God told you, so God has decided that you can't be king.”"
1 Samuel,15,24,"“I have sinned,” Saul admitted. “I disobeyed both you and the LORD . I was afraid of the army, and I listened to them instead."
1 Samuel,15,25,Please forgive me and come back with me so I can worship the LORD .”
1 Samuel,15,26,"“No!” Samuel replied, “You disobeyed the LORD , and I won't go back with you. Now the LORD has said that you can't be king of Israel any longer.”"
1 Samuel,15,27,"As Samuel turned to go, Saul grabbed the edge of Samuel's robe. It tore!"
1 Samuel,15,28,"Samuel said, “The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel away from you today, and he will give it to someone who is better than you."
1 Samuel,15,29,"Besides, the eternal God of Israel isn't a human being. He doesn't tell lies or change his mind.”"
1 Samuel,15,30,"Saul said, “I did sin, but please honour me in front of the leaders of the army and the people of Israel. Come back with me, so I can worship the LORD your God.”"
1 Samuel,15,31,"Samuel followed Saul back, and Saul worshipped the LORD."
1 Samuel,15,32,"Then Samuel shouted, “Bring me King Agag of Amalek!” Agag came in chains, and he was saying to himself, “Surely they won't kill me now.”"
1 Samuel,15,33,"But Samuel said, “Agag, you have snatched children from their mothers' arms and killed them. Now your mother will be without children.” Then Samuel chopped Agag to pieces at the place of worship in Gilgal."
1 Samuel,15,34,"Samuel went home to Ramah, and Saul returned to his home in Gibeah."
1 Samuel,15,35,"Even though Samuel felt sad about Saul, Samuel never saw him again. The LORD was sorry he had made Saul the king of Israel."
1 Samuel,16,1,"One day he said, “Samuel, I've rejected Saul, and I refuse to let him be king any longer. Stop feeling sad about him. Put some olive oil in a small container and go and visit a man named Jesse, who lives in Bethlehem. I've chosen one of his sons to be my king.”"
1 Samuel,16,2,"Samuel answered, “If I do that, Saul will find out and have me killed.” “Take a calf with you,” the LORD replied. “Tell everyone that you've come to offer it as a sacrifice to me,"
1 Samuel,16,3,"then invite Jesse to the sacrifice. When I show you which one of his sons I have chosen, pour the olive oil on his head.”"
1 Samuel,16,4,"Samuel did what the LORD told him and went to Bethlehem. The town leaders went to meet him, but they were terribly afraid and asked, “Is this a friendly visit?”"
1 Samuel,16,5,"“Yes, it is!” Samuel answered. “I've come to offer a sacrifice to the LORD . Get yourselves ready to take part in the sacrifice and come with me.” Samuel also invited Jesse and his sons to come to the sacrifice, and he got them ready to take part."
1 Samuel,16,6,"When Jesse and his sons arrived, Samuel noticed Jesse's eldest son, Eliab. “He must be the one the LORD has chosen,” Samuel said to himself."
1 Samuel,16,7,"But the LORD told him, “Samuel, don't think Eliab is the one just because he's tall and handsome. He isn't the one I've chosen. People judge others by what they look like, but I judge people by what is in their hearts.”"
1 Samuel,16,8,"Jesse told his son Abinadab to go over to Samuel, but Samuel said, “No, the LORD hasn't chosen him.”"
1 Samuel,16,9,"Next, Jesse sent his son Shammah to him, and Samuel said, “The LORD hasn't chosen him either.”"
1 Samuel,16,10,"Jesse sent all seven of his sons over to Samuel. Finally, Samuel said, “Jesse, the LORD hasn't chosen any of these young men."
1 Samuel,16,11,"Do you have any more sons?” “Yes,” Jesse answered. “My youngest son David is out taking care of the sheep.” “Send for him!” Samuel said. “We won't start the ceremony until he gets here.”"
1 Samuel,16,12,"Jesse sent for David. He was a healthy, good-looking boy with a sparkle in his eyes. As soon as David came, the LORD told Samuel, “He's the one! Get up and pour the olive oil on his head.”"
1 Samuel,16,13,"Samuel poured the oil on David's head while his brothers watched. At that moment, the Spirit of the LORD took control of David and stayed with him from then on. Samuel returned home to Ramah."
1 Samuel,16,14,"The Spirit of the LORD had left Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD was terrifying him."
1 Samuel,16,15,"“It's an evil spirit from God that's frightening you,” Saul's officials told him."
1 Samuel,16,16,"“Your Majesty, let us go and look for someone who is good at playing the harp. He can play for you whenever the evil spirit from God bothers you, and you'll feel better.”"
1 Samuel,16,17,"“All right,” Saul answered. “Find me someone who is good at playing the harp and bring him here.”"
1 Samuel,16,18,"“A man named Jesse who lives in Bethlehem has a son who can play the harp,” one official said. “He's a brave warrior, he's good-looking, he can speak well, and the LORD is with him.”"
1 Samuel,16,19,Saul sent a message to Jesse: “Tell your son David to leave your sheep and come here to me.”
1 Samuel,16,20,"Jesse loaded a donkey with bread and a goatskin full of wine, then he told David to take the donkey and a young goat to Saul."
1 Samuel,16,21,David went to Saul and started working for him. Saul liked him so much that he put David in charge of carrying his weapons.
1 Samuel,16,22,"Not long after this, Saul sent another message to Jesse: “I really like David. Please let him stay with me.”"
1 Samuel,16,23,"Whenever the evil spirit from God bothered Saul, David would play his harp. Saul would relax and feel better, and the evil spirit would go away."
1 Samuel,17,1,"The Philistines got ready for war and brought their troops together to attack the town of Socoh in Judah. They set up camp at Ephes-Dammim, between Socoh and Azekah."
1 Samuel,18,1,"David and Saul finished talking, and soon David and Jonathan became best friends. Jonathan thought as much of David as he did of himself."
1 Samuel,18,2,"From that time on, Saul kept David in his service and would not let David go back to his own family."
1 Samuel,18,3,Jonathan liked David so much that they promised they would always be loyal friends.
1 Samuel,18,4,"Jonathan took off the robe that he was wearing and gave it to David. He also gave him his military clothes, his sword, his bow and arrows, and his belt."
1 Samuel,18,5,"David was a success in everything that Saul sent him to do, and Saul made him a high officer in his army. That pleased everyone, including Saul's other officers."
1 Samuel,18,6,"David had killed Goliath, the battle was over, and the Israelite army set out for home. As the army went along, women came out of each Israelite town to welcome King Saul. They were singing happy songs and dancing to the music of tambourines and harps."
1 Samuel,18,7,They sang: Saul has killed a thousand enemies; David has killed ten thousand enemies!
1 Samuel,18,8,"This song made Saul very angry, and he thought, “They are saying that David has killed ten times more enemies than I ever did. Next they will want to make him king.”"
1 Samuel,18,9,Saul never again trusted David.
1 Samuel,18,10,"The next day the LORD let an evil spirit take control of Saul, and he began acting like a mad man inside his house. David came to play the harp for Saul as usual, but this time Saul had a spear in his hand."
1 Samuel,18,11,"Saul thought, “I'll pin David to the wall.” He threw the spear at David twice, but David dodged and got away both times."
1 Samuel,18,12,"Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was helping David and was no longer helping him."
1 Samuel,18,13,Saul put David in charge of a thousand soldiers and sent him out to fight.
1 Samuel,18,14,"The LORD helped David, and he and his soldiers always won their battles."
1 Samuel,18,15,This made Saul even more afraid of David.
1 Samuel,18,16,"But everyone else in Judah and Israel was loyal to David, because he led the army in battle."
1 Samuel,18,17,"One day, Saul told David, “If you'll be brave and fight the LORD 's battles for me, I'll let you marry my eldest daughter Merab.” But Saul was really thinking, “I don't want to kill David myself, so I'll let the Philistines do it for me.”"
1 Samuel,18,18,"David answered, “How could I possibly marry your daughter? I'm not very important, and neither is my family.”"
1 Samuel,18,19,"But when the time came for David to marry Saul's daughter Merab, Saul told her to marry Adriel from the town of Meholah."
1 Samuel,18,20,"Saul had another daughter. Her name was Michal, and Saul found out that she was in love with David. This made Saul happy,"
1 Samuel,18,21,"and he thought, “I'll tell David he can marry Michal, but I'll set it up so that the Philistines will kill him.” He told David, “I'm going to give you a second chance to marry one of my daughters.”"
1 Samuel,19,1,"One day, Saul told his son Jonathan and his officers to kill David. But Jonathan liked David a lot,"
1 Samuel,20,1,"David escaped from Prophets Village. Then he ran to see Jonathan and asked, “Why does your father Saul want to kill me? What have I done wrong?”"
1 Samuel,20,2,“My father can't be trying to kill you! He never does anything without telling me about it. Why would he hide this from me? It can't be true!”
1 Samuel,20,3,"“Jonathan, I swear it's true! But your father knows how much you like me, and he didn't want to break your heart. That's why he didn't tell you. I swear by the living LORD and by your own life that I'm only one step ahead of death.”"
1 Samuel,20,4,"Then Jonathan said, “Tell me what to do, and I'll do it.”"
1 Samuel,20,5,"David answered: Tomorrow is the New Moon Festival, and I'm supposed to have dinner with your father. But instead, I'll hide in a field until the evening of the next day."
1 Samuel,20,6,"If Saul wonders where I am, tell him, “David asked me to let him go to his home town of Bethlehem, so he could take part in a sacrifice his family makes there every year.”"
1 Samuel,20,7,"If your father says it's all right, then I'm safe. But if he gets angry, you'll know he wants to harm me."
1 Samuel,20,8,"Be kind to me. After all, it was your idea to promise the LORD that we would always be loyal friends. If I've done anything wrong, kill me yourself, but don't hand me over to your father."
1 Samuel,20,9,"“Don't worry,” Jonathan said. “If I find out that my father wants to kill you, I'll certainly let you know.”"
1 Samuel,20,10,“How will you do that?” David asked.
1 Samuel,20,11,"“Let's go out to this field, and I'll tell you,” Jonathan answered. When they got there,"
1 Samuel,20,12,"Jonathan said: I swear by the LORD God of Israel, that two days from now I'll know what my father is planning. Of course I'll let you know if he's friendly towards you."
1 Samuel,20,13,"But if he wants to harm you, I promise to tell you and help you escape. And I ask the LORD to punish me severely if I don't keep my promise. I pray that the LORD will bless you, just as he used to bless my father."
1 Samuel,21,1,"David went to see Ahimelech, a priest who lived in the town of Nob. Ahimelech was trembling with fear as he came out to meet David. “Why are you alone?” Ahimelech asked. “Why isn't anyone else with you?”"
1 Samuel,21,2,"“I'm on a mission for King Saul,” David answered. “He ordered me not to tell anyone what the mission is all about, so I told my soldiers to stay somewhere else."
1 Samuel,21,3,Do you have any food you can give me? Could you spare five loaves of bread?”
1 Samuel,21,4,"“The only bread I have is the sacred bread,” the priest told David. “You can have it if your soldiers didn't sleep with women last night.”"
1 Samuel,21,5,"“Of course we didn't sleep with women,” David answered. “I never let my men do that when we're on a mission. They have to be acceptable to worship God even when we're on an ordinary mission, and today we're on a special mission.”"
1 Samuel,21,6,The only bread the priest had was the sacred bread that he had taken from the place of worship after putting out the fresh loaves. So he gave it to David.
1 Samuel,21,7,"It so happened that one of Saul's officers was there, worshipping the LORD that day. His name was Doeg the Edomite, and he was the strongest of Saul's shepherds."
1 Samuel,21,8,"David asked Ahimelech, “Do you have a spear or a sword? I had to leave so quickly on this mission for the king that I didn't bring along my sword or any other weapons.”"
1 Samuel,21,9,"The priest answered, “The only sword here is the one that belonged to Goliath the Philistine. You were the one who killed him in Elah Valley, and so you can take his sword if you want to. It's wrapped in a cloth behind the statue.” “It's the best sword there is,” David said. “I'll take it!”"
1 Samuel,21,10,"David kept on running from Saul that day until he came to Gath, where he met with King Achish."
1 Samuel,21,11,"The officers of King Achish were also there, and they asked Achish, “Isn't David a king back in his own country? Don't the Israelites dance and sing, ‘Saul has killed a thousand enemies; David has killed ten thousand enemies’?”"
1 Samuel,21,12,"David thought about what they were saying, and it made him afraid of Achish."
1 Samuel,21,13,"So in front of everyone, he pretended to be insane. He acted confused and scratched on the doors of the town gate, while drooling in his beard."
1 Samuel,21,14,“Look at him!” Achish said to his officers. “You can see he's mad. Why did you bring him to me?
1 Samuel,21,15,I have enough mad people without your bringing another one here. Keep him away from my palace!”
1 Samuel,22,1,"When David escaped from the town of Gath, he went to Adullam Cave. His brothers and the rest of his family found out where he was, and they followed him there."
1 Samuel,22,2,"A lot of other people joined him too. Some were in trouble, others were angry or in debt, and David was soon the leader of four hundred men."
1 Samuel,22,3,"David left Adullam Cave and went to the town of Mizpeh in Moab, where he talked with the king of Moab. “Please,” David said, “let my father and mother stay with you until I find out what God will do with me.”"
1 Samuel,22,4,"So he brought his parents to the king of Moab, and they stayed with him while David was in hiding."
1 Samuel,22,5,"One day the prophet Gad told David, “Don't stay here! Go back to Judah.” David then left and went to Hereth Forest."
1 Samuel,22,6,"Saul was sitting under a small tree on top of the hill at Gibeah when he heard that David and his men had been seen. Saul was holding his spear, and his officers were standing in front of him."
1 Samuel,22,7,"He told them: Listen to me! You belong to the Benjamin tribe, so if that son of Jesse ever becomes king, he won't give you fields or vineyards. He won't make you officers in charge of thousands or hundreds as I have done."
1 Samuel,22,8,But you're all plotting against me! Not one of you told me that my own son Jonathan had made an agreement with him. Not one of you cared enough to tell me that Jonathan had helped one of my officers rebel. Now that son of Jesse is trying to ambush me.
1 Samuel,22,9,"Doeg the Edomite was standing with the other officers and spoke up, “When I was in the town of Nob, I saw that son of Jesse. He was visiting the priest Ahimelech the son of Ahitub."
1 Samuel,22,10,"Ahimelech talked to the LORD for him, then gave him food and the sword that had belonged to Goliath the Philistine.”"
1 Samuel,22,11,"Saul sent a message to Ahimelech and his whole family of priests at Nob, ordering them to come to him. When they came,"
1 Samuel,22,12,"Saul told them, “Listen to me, you son of Ahitub.” “Certainly, Your Majesty,” Ahimelech answered."
1 Samuel,22,13,"Saul demanded, “Why did you plot against me with that son of Jesse? You helped him rebel against me by giving him food and a sword, and by talking with God for him. Now he's trying to ambush me!”"
1 Samuel,22,14,"“Your Majesty, none of your officers is more loyal than David!” Ahimelech replied. “He's your son-in-law and the captain of your bodyguard. Everyone in your family respects him."
1 Samuel,22,15,"This isn't the first time I've talked with God for David, and it's never made you angry before! Please don't accuse me or my family like this. I have no idea what's going on!”"
1 Samuel,22,16,"“Ahimelech,” Saul said, “you and your whole family are going to die.”"
1 Samuel,22,17,"Saul shouted to his bodyguards, “These priests of the LORD helped David! They knew he was running away, but they didn't tell me. Kill them!” But the king's officers would not attack the priests of the LORD."
1 Samuel,22,18,"Saul turned to Doeg, who was from Edom, and said, “Kill the priests!” On that same day, Doeg killed eighty-five priests."
1 Samuel,22,19,"Then he attacked the town of Nob, where the priests had lived, and he killed everyone there—men, women, children, and babies. He even killed their cattle, donkeys, and sheep."
1 Samuel,22,20,Ahimelech's son Abiathar was the only one who escaped. He ran to David
1 Samuel,22,21,"and told him, “Saul has murdered the priests at Nob!”"
1 Samuel,22,22,"David answered, “That day when I saw Doeg, I knew he would tell Saul! Your family died because of me."
1 Samuel,22,23,Stay here. Isn't the same person trying to kill both of us? Don't worry! You'll be safe here with me.”
1 Samuel,23,1,"One day some people told David, “The Philistines keep attacking the town of Keilah and stealing grain from the threshing place.”"
1 Samuel,23,2,"David asked the LORD , “Should I attack these Philistines?” “Yes,” the LORD answered. “Attack them and rescue Keilah.”"
1 Samuel,23,3,"But David's men said, “Look, even here in Judah we're afraid of the Philistines. We will be terrified if we try to fight them at Keilah!”"
1 Samuel,23,4,"David asked the LORD about it again. “Leave at once,” the LORD answered. “I will give you victory over the Philistines at Keilah.”"
1 Samuel,23,5,"David and his men went there and fiercely attacked the Philistines. They killed many of them, then led away their cattle, and rescued the people of Keilah."
1 Samuel,24,1,"When Saul got back from fighting off the Philistines, he heard that David was in the desert around En-Gedi."
1 Samuel,24,2,Saul led three thousand of Israel's best soldiers out to look for David and his men near Wild Goat Rocks at En-Gedi.
1 Samuel,24,3,"There were some sheep pens along the side of the road, and one of them was built around the entrance to a cave. Saul went into the cave to relieve himself. David and his men were hiding at the back of the cave."
1 Samuel,24,4,"They whispered to David, “The LORD told you he was going to let you defeat your enemies and do whatever you want with them. This must be the day the LORD was talking about.” David sneaked over and cut off a small piece of Saul's robe, but Saul didn't notice a thing."
1 Samuel,24,5,"Afterwards, David was sorry that he had even done that,"
1 Samuel,25,1,"Samuel died, and people from all over Israel gathered to mourn for him when he was buried at his home in Ramah. Meanwhile, David moved his camp to Paran Desert."
1 Samuel,26,1,"Once again, some people from Ziph went to Gibeah to talk with Saul. “David has a hideout on Mount Hachilah near Jeshimon out in the desert,” they told him."
1 Samuel,26,2,Saul took three thousand of Israel's best soldiers and went to look for David there in Ziph Desert.
1 Samuel,26,3,"Saul set up camp on Mount Hachilah, which is across the road from Jeshimon. But David was hiding out in the desert. When David heard that Saul was following him,"
1 Samuel,26,4,he sent some spies to find out if it was true.
1 Samuel,26,5,"Then he sneaked up to Saul's camp. He noticed that Saul and his army commander Abner the son of Ner were sleeping in the middle of the camp, with soldiers sleeping all around them."
1 Samuel,26,6,"David asked Ahimelech the Hittite and Joab's brother Abishai, “Which one of you will go with me into Saul's camp?” “I will!” Abishai answered."
1 Samuel,26,7,"That same night, David and Abishai crept into the camp. Saul was sleeping, and his spear was stuck in the ground not far from his head. Abner and the soldiers were sound asleep all around him."
1 Samuel,26,8,"Abishai whispered, “This time God has let you get your hands on your enemy! I'll pin him to the ground with one thrust of his own spear.”"
1 Samuel,26,9,“Don't kill him!” David whispered back. “The LORD will punish anyone who kills his chosen king.
1 Samuel,26,10,"As surely as the LORD lives, the LORD will kill Saul, or Saul will die a natural death or be killed in battle."
1 Samuel,26,11,But I pray that the LORD will keep me from harming his chosen king. Let's grab his spear and his water jar and get out of here!”
1 Samuel,26,12,"David took the spear and the water jar, then left the camp. None of Saul's soldiers knew what had happened or even woke up—the LORD had made all of them fall sound asleep."
1 Samuel,26,13,"David and Abishai crossed the valley and went to the top of the next hill, where they were at a safe distance."
1 Samuel,26,14,“Abner!” David shouted towards Saul's army. “Can you hear me?” Abner shouted back. “Who dares disturb the king?”
1 Samuel,26,15,"“Abner, what kind of a man are you?” David replied. “Aren't you supposed to be the best soldier in Israel? Then why didn't you protect your king? Anyone who went into your camp could have killed him tonight."
1 Samuel,26,16,You're a complete failure! I swear by the living LORD that you and your men deserve to die for not protecting the LORD 's chosen king. Look and see if you can find the king's spear and the water jar that were near his head.”
1 Samuel,26,17,"Saul could tell it was David's voice, and he called out, “David, my son! Is that you?” “Yes it is, Your Majesty."
1 Samuel,26,18,"Why are you after me? Have I done something wrong, or have I committed a crime?"
1 Samuel,26,19,"Please listen to what I have to say. If the LORD has turned you against me, perhaps a sacrifice will make him change his mind. But if some people have turned you against me, I hope the LORD will punish them! They have forced me to leave the land that belongs to the LORD and have told me to worship foreign gods."
1 Samuel,26,20,Don't let me die in a land far away from the LORD . I'm no more important than a flea! Why should the king of Israel hunt me down as if I were a bird in the mountains?”
1 Samuel,26,21,"“David, you had the chance to kill me today. But you didn't. I was very wrong about you. It was a terrible mistake for me to try to kill you. I've acted like a fool, but I'll never try to harm you again. You're like a son to me, so please come back.”"
1 Samuel,26,22,"“Your Majesty, here's your spear! Let one of your soldiers come and get it."
1 Samuel,26,23,"The LORD put you in my power today, but you are his chosen king and I wouldn't harm you. The LORD rewards people who are faithful and live right."
1 Samuel,26,24,"I saved your life today, and I pray that the LORD will protect me and keep me safe.”"
1 Samuel,26,25,"“David, my son, I pray that the Lord will bless you and make you successful!” Saul went back home. David also left,"
1 Samuel,27,1,"but he thought to himself, “One of these days, Saul is going to kill me. The only way to escape from him is to go to Philistia. Then I'll be outside Israel, and Saul will give up trying to catch me.”"
1 Samuel,29,1,"The Philistines had brought their whole army to Aphek, while Israel's army was camping near Jezreel Spring."
1 Samuel,30,1,"It took David and his men three days to reach Ziklag. But while they had been away, the Amalekites had been raiding in the desert around there. They had attacked Ziklag, burnt it to the ground,"
1 Samuel,30,2,and had taken away the women and children.
1 Samuel,30,3,"When David and his men came to Ziklag, they saw the burnt out ruins and learnt that their families had been taken captive."
1 Samuel,30,4,They started crying and kept it up until they were too weak to cry any more.
1 Samuel,30,5,"David's two wives, Ahinoam and Abigail, had been taken captive with everyone else."
1 Samuel,30,6,"David was desperate. His soldiers were so upset over what had happened to their sons and daughters that they were thinking about stoning David to death. But he felt the LORD God giving him strength,"
1 Samuel,30,7,"and he said to the priest, “Abiathar, let's ask God what to do.” Abiathar brought everything he needed to get answers from God, and he went over to David."
1 Samuel,30,8,"Then David asked the LORD , “Should I go after the people who raided our town? Can I catch up with them?” “Go after them,” the LORD answered. “You will catch up with them, and you will rescue your families.”"
1 Samuel,31,1,"Meanwhile, the Philistines were fighting Israel at Mount Gilboa. Israel's soldiers ran from the Philistines, and many of them were killed."
1 Samuel,31,2,"The Philistines closed in on Saul and his sons, and they killed his sons Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua."
1 Samuel,31,3,"The fighting was fierce around Saul, and he was badly wounded by enemy arrows."
1 Samuel,31,4,"Saul told the soldier who carried his weapons, “Kill me with your sword! I don't want those worthless Philistines to torture me and make fun of me.” But the soldier was afraid to kill him. Saul then took out his own sword; he stuck the blade into his stomach, and fell on it."
1 Samuel,31,5,"When the soldier knew that Saul was dead, he killed himself in the same way."
1 Samuel,31,6,"Saul was dead, his three sons were dead, and the soldier who carried his weapons was dead. They and all his soldiers died on that same day."
1 Samuel,31,7,"The Israelites on the other side of Jezreel Valley and the other side of the Jordan learnt that Saul and his sons were dead. They saw that the Israelite army had run away. So they ran away too, and the Philistines moved into the towns the Israelites had left behind."
1 Samuel,31,8,"The day after the battle, when the Philistines returned to the battlefield to take the weapons of the dead Israelite soldiers, they found Saul and his three sons lying dead on Mount Gilboa."
2 Samuel,1,1,"Saul was dead. Meanwhile, David had defeated the Amalekites and returned to Ziklag."
2 Samuel,1,2,"Three days later, a soldier came from Saul's army. His clothes were torn, and earth was on his head. He went to David and knelt down in front of him."
2 Samuel,1,3,"David asked, “Where did you come from?” The man answered, “From Israel's army. I barely escaped with my life.”"
2 Samuel,1,4,"“Who won the battle?” David asked. The man said, “Our army turned and ran, but many were wounded and died. Even King Saul and his son Jonathan are dead.”"
2 Samuel,1,5,"David asked, “How do you know Saul and Jonathan are dead?”"
2 Samuel,1,6,The young man replied: I was on Mount Gilboa and saw King Saul leaning on his spear. The enemy's war chariots and cavalry were closing in on him.
2 Samuel,1,7,"When he turned round and saw me, he called me over. I went and asked what he wanted."
2 Samuel,1,8,"Saul asked me, “Who are you?” “An Amalekite,” I answered."
2 Samuel,1,9,"Then he said, “Kill me! I'm dying, and I'm in terrible pain.”"
2 Samuel,1,10,"So I killed him. I knew he was too badly wounded to live much longer. Then I took his crown and his arm-band, and I brought them to you, Your Majesty. Here they are."
2 Samuel,1,11,"Straight away, David and his soldiers tore their clothes in sorrow."
2 Samuel,1,12,"They cried all day long and would not eat anything. Everyone was sad because Saul, his son Jonathan, and many of the LORD 's people had been killed in the battle."
2 Samuel,1,13,"David asked the young man, “Where is your home?” The man replied, “My father is an Amalekite, but we live in Israel.”"
2 Samuel,2,1,"Later, David asked the LORD , “Should I go back to one of the towns of Judah?” The LORD answered, “Yes.” David asked, “Which town should I go to?” “Go to Hebron,” the LORD replied."
2 Samuel,2,2,"David went to Hebron with his two wives, Ahinoam and Abigail. Ahinoam was from Jezreel, and Abigail was the widow of Nabal from Carmel."
2 Samuel,2,3,David also took his men and their families to live in the villages near Hebron.
2 Samuel,2,4,"The people of Judah met with David at Hebron and poured olive oil on his head to show that he was their new king. Then they told David, “The people from Jabesh in Gilead buried Saul.”"
2 Samuel,2,5,"David sent messengers to tell them: The LORD bless you! You were kind enough to bury Saul your ruler,"
2 Samuel,2,6,and I pray that the LORD will be kind and faithful to you. I will be your friend because of what you have done.
2 Samuel,2,7,"Saul is dead, but the tribe of Judah has made me their king. So be strong and have courage."
2 Samuel,2,8,Abner the son of Ner had been the general of Saul's army. He took Saul's son Ishbosheth across the River Jordan to Mahanaim
2 Samuel,2,9,"and made him king of Israel, including the areas of Gilead, Asher, Jezreel, Ephraim, and Benjamin."
2 Samuel,2,10,"Ishbosheth was forty years old at the time, and he ruled for two years. But the tribe of Judah made David their king,"
2 Samuel,2,11,and he ruled from Hebron for seven and a half years.
2 Samuel,2,12,"One day, Abner and the soldiers of Ishbosheth left Mahanaim and went to Gibeon."
2 Samuel,2,13,"Meanwhile, Joab the son of Zeruiah was leading David's soldiers, and the two groups met at the pool in Gibeon. Abner and his men sat down on one side of the pool, while Joab and his men sat on the other side."
2 Samuel,2,14,"Abner yelled to Joab, “Let's get some of our best soldiers to stand up and fight each other!” Joab agreed,"
2 Samuel,2,15,and twelve of Ishbosheth's men from the tribe of Benjamin got up to fight twelve of David's men.
2 Samuel,2,16,They grabbed each other by the hair and stabbed each other in the side with their daggers. They all died there! That's why the place in Gibeon is called “Field of Daggers”.
2 Samuel,2,17,"Then everyone started fighting. Both sides fought very hard, but David's soldiers defeated Abner and the soldiers of Israel."
2 Samuel,2,18,"Zeruiah's three sons were there: Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Asahel could run as fast as a deer in an open field,"
2 Samuel,2,19,"and he ran straight after Abner, without looking to the right or to the left."
2 Samuel,2,20,"When Abner turned and saw him, he said, “Is that you, Asahel?” Asahel answered, “Yes it is.”"
2 Samuel,2,21,"Abner said, “There are soldiers all around. Stop chasing me and fight one of them! Kill him and take his clothes and weapons for yourself.” But Asahel refused to stop."
2 Samuel,2,22,"Abner said, “If you don't turn back, I'll have to kill you! Then I could never face your brother Joab again.”"
2 Samuel,2,23,"But Asahel would not turn back, so Abner struck him in the stomach with the back end of his spear. The spear went all the way through and came out of his back. Asahel fell down and died. Everyone who saw Asahel lying dead just stopped and stood still."
2 Samuel,2,24,"But Joab and Abishai went after Abner. Finally, about sunset, they came to the hill of Ammah, not far from Giah on the road to Gibeon Desert."
2 Samuel,2,25,"Abner brought the men of Benjamin together in one group on top of a hill, and they got ready to fight."
2 Samuel,2,26,"Abner shouted to Joab, “Aren't we ever going to stop killing each other? Don't you know that the longer we keep on doing this, the worse it's going to be when it's all over? When are you going to order your men to stop chasing their own relatives?”"
2 Samuel,2,27,"Joab shouted back, “I swear by the living God, if you hadn't spoken, my men would have chased their relatives all night!”"
2 Samuel,2,28,"Joab took his trumpet and blew the signal for his soldiers to stop chasing the soldiers of Israel. Straight away, the fighting stopped."
2 Samuel,2,29,Abner and his troops marched through the Jordan valley all that night. Then they crossed the river and marched all morning until they arrived back at Mahanaim.
2 Samuel,2,30,"As soon as Joab stopped chasing Abner, he got David's troops together and counted them. There were nineteen missing besides Asahel."
2 Samuel,2,31,But David's soldiers had killed 360 of Abner's men from the tribe of Benjamin.
2 Samuel,2,32,Joab and his troops carried Asahel's body to Bethlehem and buried him in the family burial place. Then they marched all night and reached Hebron before sunrise.
2 Samuel,3,1,"This battle was the beginning of a long war between the followers of Saul and the followers of David. Saul's power grew weaker, but David's grew stronger."
2 Samuel,4,1,Ishbosheth felt like giving up after he heard that Abner had died in Hebron. Everyone in Israel was terrified.
2 Samuel,4,2,"Ishbosheth had put the two brothers Baanah and Rechab in charge of the soldiers who raided enemy villages. Rimmon was their father, and they were from the town of Beeroth, which belonged to the tribe of Benjamin."
2 Samuel,4,3,"The people who used to live in Beeroth had run away to Gittaim, and they still live there."
2 Samuel,4,4,"Saul's son Jonathan had a son named Mephibosheth, who had not been able to walk since he was five years old. It happened when someone from Jezreel told his nurse that Saul and Jonathan had died. She hurried off with the boy in her arms, but he fell and injured his legs."
2 Samuel,4,5,"One day about midday, Rechab and Baanah went to Ishbosheth's house. It was a hot day, and he was resting"
2 Samuel,5,1,"Israel's leaders met with David at Hebron and said, “We are your relatives."
2 Samuel,5,2,"Even when Saul was king, you led our nation in battle. And the LORD promised that some day you would rule Israel and take care of us like a shepherd.”"
2 Samuel,5,3,"During the meeting, David made an agreement with the leaders and asked the LORD to be their witness. Then the leaders poured olive oil on David's head to show that he was now the king of Israel."
2 Samuel,5,4,"David was thirty years old when he became king, and he ruled for forty years."
2 Samuel,5,5,"He lived in Hebron for the first seven and a half years and ruled only Judah. Then he moved to Jerusalem, where he ruled both Israel and Judah for thirty-three years."
2 Samuel,5,6,"The Jebusites lived in Jerusalem, and David led his army there to attack them. The Jebusites did not think he could get in, so they told him, “You can't get in here! We could drive you away, even if we couldn't see or walk!”"
2 Samuel,6,1,David brought together thirty thousand of Israel's best soldiers and
2 Samuel,6,2,"led them to Baalah in Judah, which was also called Kiriath-Jearim. They were going there to get the sacred chest and bring it back to Jerusalem. The throne of the LORD All-Powerful is above the winged creatures on top of this chest, and he is worshipped there."
2 Samuel,6,3,"They put the sacred chest on a new ox cart and started bringing it down the hill from Abinadab's house. Abinadab's sons Uzzah and Ahio were guiding the ox cart,"
2 Samuel,6,4,with Ahio walking in front of it.
2 Samuel,6,5,"Some of the people of Israel were playing music on small harps and other stringed instruments, and on tambourines, castanets, and cymbals. David and the others were happy, and they danced for the LORD with all their might."
2 Samuel,6,6,"But when they came to Nacon's threshing floor, the oxen stumbled, so Uzzah reached out and took hold of the sacred chest."
2 Samuel,6,7,"The LORD God was very angry with Uzzah for doing this, and he killed Uzzah there beside the chest."
2 Samuel,6,8,"David got angry with God for killing Uzzah. He named that place “Bursting Out Against Uzzah”, and that's what it's still called."
2 Samuel,6,9,"David was afraid of the LORD and thought, “Should I really take the sacred chest to my city?”"
2 Samuel,6,10,"He decided not to take it there. Instead, he turned off the road and took it to the home of Obed-Edom, who was from Gath."
2 Samuel,7,1,"King David moved into his new palace, and the LORD let his kingdom be at peace."
2 Samuel,7,2,"Then one day, as David was talking with Nathan the prophet, David said, “Look around! I live in a palace made of cedar, but the sacred chest has to stay in a tent.”"
2 Samuel,7,3,"Nathan replied, “The LORD is with you, so do what you want!”"
2 Samuel,7,4,"That night, the LORD told Nathan"
2 Samuel,7,5,"to go to David and give him this message: David, you are my servant, so listen to what I say. Why should you build a temple for me?"
2 Samuel,7,6,"I didn't live in a temple when I brought my people out of Egypt, and I don't live in one now. A tent has always been my home wherever I have gone with them."
2 Samuel,7,7,I chose leaders and told them to be like shepherds for my people Israel. But did I ever say anything to even one of them about building a cedar temple for me?
2 Samuel,7,8,"David, this is what I, the LORD All-Powerful, say to you. I brought you in from the fields where you took care of sheep, and I made you the leader of my people."
2 Samuel,7,9,"Wherever you went, I helped you and destroyed your enemies right in front of your eyes. I have made you one of the most famous people in the world."
2 Samuel,7,10,"I have given my people Israel a land of their own where they can live in peace, and they won't have to tremble with fear any more. Evil nations won't bother them, as they did"
2 Samuel,7,11,when I let judges rule my people. And I have kept your enemies from attacking you. Now I promise that you and your descendants will be kings.
2 Samuel,7,12,"I'll choose one of your sons to be king when you reach the end of your life and are buried in the tomb of your ancestors. I'll make him a strong ruler,"
2 Samuel,7,13,and no one will be able to take his kingdom away from him. He will be the one to build a temple for me.
2 Samuel,7,14,"I will be his father, and he will be my son. When he does wrong, I'll see that he is corrected, just as children are corrected by their parents."
2 Samuel,7,15,"But I will never put an end to my agreement with him, as I put an end to my agreement with Saul, who was king before you."
2 Samuel,7,16,I will make sure that one of your descendants will always be king.
2 Samuel,7,17,Nathan told David exactly what he had heard in the vision.
2 Samuel,7,18,"David went into the tent he had set up for the sacred chest. Then he sat there and prayed: LORD All-Powerful, my family and I don't deserve what you have already done for us,"
2 Samuel,7,19,and yet you have promised to do even more. Is this the way you usually treat people?
2 Samuel,7,20,"I am your servant, and you know my thoughts, so there is nothing more that I need to say."
2 Samuel,7,21,"You have done this wonderful thing, and you have let me know about it, because you wanted to keep your promise."
2 Samuel,7,22," LORD All-Powerful, you are greater than all others. No one is like you, and you alone are God. Everything we have heard about you is true."
2 Samuel,7,23,"And there is no other nation on earth like Israel, the nation you rescued from slavery in Egypt to be your own. You became famous by using great and wonderful miracles to force other nations and their gods out of your land, so your people could live here."
2 Samuel,7,24,"You have chosen Israel to be your people for ever, and you have become their God."
2 Samuel,7,25,"And now, LORD God, please do what you have promised me and my descendants."
2 Samuel,7,26,"Then you will be famous for ever, and everyone will say, “The LORD God All-Powerful rules Israel, and David's descendants are his chosen kings.”"
2 Samuel,7,27,"After all, you really are Israel's God, the LORD All-Powerful. You've told me that you will let my descendants be kings. That's why I have the courage to pray to you like this, even though I am only your servant."
2 Samuel,7,28," LORD All-Powerful, you are God. You have promised me some very good things, and you can be trusted to do what you promise."
2 Samuel,7,29,"Please bless my descendants and let them always be your chosen kings. You have already promised, and I'm sure that you will bless my family for ever."
2 Samuel,8,1,"Later, David attacked and badly defeated the Philistines. Israel was now free from their control."
2 Samuel,8,2,"David also defeated the Moabites. Then he made their soldiers lie down on the ground, and he measured them off with a rope. He would measure off two lengths of the rope and have those men killed, then he would measure off one length and let those men live. The people of Moab had to accept David as their ruler and pay taxes to him."
2 Samuel,8,3,"David set out for the River Euphrates to build a monument there. On his way, he defeated the king of Zobah, whose name was Hadadezer the son of Rehob."
2 Samuel,8,4,"In the battle, David captured seventeen hundred cavalry and twenty thousand foot soldiers. He also captured war chariots, but he destroyed all but one hundred of them."
2 Samuel,8,5,"When troops from the Aramean kingdom of Damascus came to help Hadadezer, David killed twenty thousand of them."
2 Samuel,8,6,"He left some of his soldiers in Damascus, and the Arameans had to accept David as their ruler and pay taxes to him. Everywhere David went, the LORD helped him win battles."
2 Samuel,8,7,"Hadadezer's officers had carried their arrows in gold cases hung over their shoulders, but David took these cases and brought them to Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,8,8,"He also took a lot of bronze from the cities of Betah and Berothai, which had belonged to Hadadezer."
2 Samuel,9,1,"One day, David thought, “I wonder if any of Saul's family are still alive. If they are, I will be kind to them, because I made a promise to Jonathan.”"
2 Samuel,9,2,"David called in Ziba, one of the servants of Saul's family. David said, “So you are Ziba.” “Yes, Your Majesty, I am.”"
2 Samuel,9,3,"David asked, “Are any of Saul's family still alive? If there are, I want to be kind to them.” Ziba answered, “One of Jonathan's sons is still alive, but he can't walk.”"
2 Samuel,9,4,"“Where is he?” David asked. Ziba replied, “He lives in Lo-Debar with Machir the son of Ammiel.”"
2 Samuel,10,1,"Some time later, King Nahash of Ammon died, and his son Hanun became king."
2 Samuel,10,2,"David said, “Nahash was kind to me, and I will be kind to his son.” So he sent some officials to the country of Ammon to tell Hanun how sorry he was that his father had died."
2 Samuel,10,3,"But Hanun's officials told him, “Do you really believe David is honouring your father by sending these people to comfort you? He probably sent them to spy on our city, so he can destroy it.”"
2 Samuel,10,4,"Hanun arrested David's officials and had their beards shaved off on one side of their faces. He had their robes cut off just below the waist, and then he sent them away."
2 Samuel,10,5,"They were terribly ashamed. When David found out what had happened to his officials, he sent a message and told them, “Stay in Jericho until your beards grow back. Then you can come home.”"
2 Samuel,10,6,"The Ammonites realized that they had made David very angry, so they hired more foreign soldiers. Twenty thousand of them were foot soldiers from the Aramean cities of Beth-Rehob and Zobah, one thousand were from the king of Maacah, and twelve thousand were from the region of Tob."
2 Samuel,10,7,"David heard what they had done, and he sent out Joab with all his well-trained soldiers."
2 Samuel,10,8,The Ammonite troops came out and got ready to fight in front of the gate to their city. The Arameans from Zobah and Rehob and the soldiers from Tob and Maacah formed a separate group in the nearby fields.
2 Samuel,10,9,"Joab saw that he had to fight in front and behind at the same time, and he picked some of the best Israelite soldiers to fight the Arameans."
2 Samuel,10,10,He put his brother Abishai in command of the rest of the army and made them fight the Ammonites.
2 Samuel,10,11,"Joab told his brother, “If the Arameans are too much for me to handle, you can come and help me. If the Ammonites are too strong for you, I'll come and help you."
2 Samuel,10,12,Be brave and fight hard to protect our people and the cities of our God. I pray that the LORD will do whatever pleases him.”
2 Samuel,10,13,"Joab and his soldiers attacked the Arameans, and the Arameans ran from them."
2 Samuel,10,14,"When the Ammonite soldiers saw that the Arameans had run away, they ran from Abishai's soldiers and went back into their own city. Joab stopped fighting the Ammonites and returned to Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,10,15,"The Arameans realized they had lost the battle, so they brought all their troops together again."
2 Samuel,10,16,"Hadadezer sent messengers to call in the Arameans who were on the other side of the River Euphrates. Then Shobach, the commander of Hadadezer's army, led them to the town of Helam."
2 Samuel,10,17,"David found out what the Arameans were doing, and he brought Israel's whole army together. They crossed the River Jordan and went to Helam, where the Arameans were ready to meet them."
2 Samuel,10,18,"The Arameans attacked, but then they ran from Israel. David killed seven hundred chariot drivers and forty thousand cavalry. He also killed Shobach, their commander."
2 Samuel,10,19,"When the kings who had been under Hadadezer's rule saw that Israel had beaten them, they made peace with Israel and accepted David as their ruler. The Arameans were afraid to help Ammon any more."
2 Samuel,11,1,"It was now spring, the time when kings go to war. David sent out the whole Israelite army under the command of Joab and his officers. They destroyed the Ammonite army and surrounded the capital city of Rabbah, but David stayed in Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,12,1,and he sent Nathan the prophet to tell this story to David: A rich man and a poor man lived in the same town.
2 Samuel,12,2,"The rich man owned a lot of sheep and cattle,"
2 Samuel,12,3,but the poor man had only one little lamb that he had bought and raised. The lamb became a pet for him and his children. He even let it eat from his plate and drink from his cup and sleep on his lap. The lamb was like one of his own children.
2 Samuel,12,4,"One day someone came to visit the rich man, but the rich man didn't want to kill any of his own sheep or cattle and serve it to the visitor. So he stole the poor man's little lamb and served it instead."
2 Samuel,12,5,"David was furious with the rich man and said to Nathan, “I swear by the living LORD that the man who did this deserves to die!"
2 Samuel,12,6,"And because he didn't have any pity on the poor man, he will have to pay four times what the lamb was worth.”"
2 Samuel,12,7,Then Nathan told David: You are that rich man! Now listen to what the LORD God of Israel says to you: “I chose you to be the king of Israel. I kept you safe from Saul
2 Samuel,12,8,"and even gave you his house and his wives. I let you rule Israel and Judah, and if that had not been enough, I would have given you much more."
2 Samuel,12,9,"Why did you disobey me and do such a horrible thing? You murdered Uriah the Hittite by letting the Ammonites kill him, so you could take his wife."
2 Samuel,12,10,"“Because you wouldn't obey me and took Uriah's wife for yourself, your family will never live in peace."
2 Samuel,12,11,"Someone from your own family will cause you a lot of trouble, and I will take your wives and give them to another man before your very eyes. He will go to bed with them while everyone looks on."
2 Samuel,12,12,"What you did was in secret, but I will do this in the open for everyone in Israel to see.”"
2 Samuel,13,1,"David had a beautiful daughter named Tamar, who was the sister of Absalom. She was also the half-sister of Amnon, who fell in love with her."
2 Samuel,13,2,"But Tamar was a virgin, and Amnon could not think of a way to be alone with her. He was so upset about it that he made himself sick."
2 Samuel,13,3,"Amnon had a friend named Jonadab, who was the son of David's brother Shimeah. Jonadab always knew how to get what he wanted,"
2 Samuel,13,4,"and he said to Amnon, “What's the matter? You're the king's son! You shouldn't have to go around feeling sorry for yourself every morning.” Amnon said, “I'm in love with Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.”"
2 Samuel,13,5,"Jonadab told him, “Lie down on your bed and pretend to be sick. When your father comes to see you, ask him to send Tamar, so you can watch her cook something for you. Then she can serve you the food.”"
2 Samuel,13,6,"So Amnon went to bed and pretended to be sick. When the king came to see him, Amnon said, “Please, ask Tamar to come over. She can make some special bread while I watch, and then she can serve me the bread.”"
2 Samuel,13,7,"David told Tamar, “Go over to Amnon's house and prepare him some food.”"
2 Samuel,13,8,"When she got there, he was lying in bed. She mixed the dough, made the loaves, and baked them while he watched."
2 Samuel,13,9,"Then she took the bread out of the pan and put it on his plate, but he refused to eat it. Amnon said, “Send the servants out of the house.” After they had gone,"
2 Samuel,13,10,"he said to Tamar, “Serve the food in my bedroom.” Tamar picked up the bread that she had made and brought it into Amnon's bedroom."
2 Samuel,13,11,"But as she was taking it over to him, he grabbed her and said, “Come to bed with me!”"
2 Samuel,13,12,"She answered, “No! Please don't force me! This sort of thing isn't done in Israel. It's too disgusting!"
2 Samuel,13,13,"Think of me. I'll be disgraced for ever! And think of yourself. Everyone in Israel will say you're nothing but a load of rubbish! Just ask the king, and he will let you marry me.”"
2 Samuel,13,14,"But Amnon would not listen to what she said. He was stronger than she was, so he overpowered her and raped her."
2 Samuel,13,15,"Then Amnon hated her even more than he had loved her before. So he told her, “Get up and get out!”"
2 Samuel,13,16,"She said, “Don't send me away! That would be worse than what you have already done.” But Amnon would not listen."
2 Samuel,13,17,"He called in his servant and said, “Throw this woman out and lock the door!”"
2 Samuel,13,18,"The servant made her leave, and he locked the door behind her. The king's unmarried daughters used to wear long robes with sleeves."
2 Samuel,13,19,Tamar tore the robe she was wearing and put ashes on her head. Then she covered her face with her hands and cried loudly as she walked away.
2 Samuel,13,20,"Tamar's brother Absalom said to her, “How could Amnon have done such a terrible thing to you! But since he's your brother, don't tell anyone what happened. Just try not to think about it.” Tamar soon moved into Absalom's house, but she was always sad and lonely."
2 Samuel,13,21,"When David heard what had happened to Tamar, he was very angry. But Amnon was his eldest son and also his favourite, and David would not do anything to make Amnon unhappy."
2 Samuel,13,22,"Absalom treated Amnon as though nothing had happened, but he hated Amnon for what he had done to his sister Tamar."
2 Samuel,13,23,"Two years later, Absalom's servants were cutting wool from his sheep in Baal-Hazor near the town of Ephraim, and Absalom invited all the king's sons to be there."
2 Samuel,13,24,"Then he went to David and said, “My servants are cutting the wool from my sheep. Please come and join us!”"
2 Samuel,13,25,"David answered, “No, my son, we won't go. It would be too expensive for you.” Absalom tried to get him to change his mind, but David did not want to go. He only said that he hoped they would have a good time."
2 Samuel,13,26,"Absalom said, “If you won't go, at least let my brother Amnon come with us.” David asked, “Why should he go with you?”"
2 Samuel,13,27,"But Absalom kept on insisting, and finally David let Amnon and all his other sons go with Absalom. Absalom prepared a banquet fit for a king."
2 Samuel,13,28,"But he told his servants, “Keep an eye on Amnon. When he gets a little drunk from the wine and is feeling good, I'll give the signal. Then kill him! I've commanded you to do it, so don't be afraid. Be strong and brave.”"
2 Samuel,13,29,"Absalom's servants killed Amnon, just as Absalom had told them. The rest of the king's sons quickly rode away on their mules to escape from Absalom."
2 Samuel,13,30,"While they were on their way to Jerusalem, someone told David, “Absalom has killed all your sons! Not even one is left.”"
2 Samuel,13,31,"David got up, and in his sorrow he tore his clothes and lay down on the ground. His servants remained standing, but they tore their clothes too."
2 Samuel,13,32,"Then David's nephew Jonadab said, “Your Majesty, not all your sons were killed! Only Amnon is dead. On the day that Amnon raped Tamar, Absalom decided to kill him."
2 Samuel,13,33,"Don't worry about the report that all your sons were killed. Only Amnon is dead,"
2 Samuel,13,34,"and Absalom has run away.” One of the guards noticed a lot of people coming along the hillside on the road to Horonaim. He went and told the king, “I saw some men coming along Horonaim Road.”"
2 Samuel,13,35,"Jonadab said, “Your Majesty, look! Here come your sons now, just as I told you.”"
2 Samuel,13,36,"No sooner had he said it, than David's sons came in. They were weeping out loud, and David and all his officials cried just as loudly."
2 Samuel,14,1,"Joab knew that David couldn't stop thinking about Absalom,"
2 Samuel,15,1,"Some time later, Absalom got himself a chariot with horses to pull it, and he had fifty men to run in front."
2 Samuel,15,2,"He would get up early each morning and wait by the side of the road that led to the city gate. Anyone who had a complaint to bring to King David would have to go that way, and Absalom would ask each of them, “Where are you from?” If they said, “I'm from a tribe in the north,”"
2 Samuel,15,3,"Absalom would say, “You deserve to win your case. But the king doesn't have anyone to hear complaints like yours."
2 Samuel,15,4,I wish someone would make me the judge around here! I would be fair to everyone.”
2 Samuel,15,5,"Whenever anyone would come to Absalom and start bowing down, he would reach out and hug and kiss them."
2 Samuel,15,6,That's how he treated everyone from Israel who brought a complaint to the king. Soon everyone in Israel liked Absalom better than they liked David.
2 Samuel,15,7,"Four years later, Absalom said to David, “Please, let me go to Hebron. I have to keep a promise that I made to the LORD,"
2 Samuel,15,8,"when I was living with the Arameans in Geshur. I promised that if the LORD would bring me back to live in Jerusalem, I would worship him in Hebron.”"
2 Samuel,15,9,"David gave his permission, and Absalom went to Hebron."
2 Samuel,16,1,"David had started down the other side of the Mount of Olives, when he was met by Ziba, the chief servant of Mephibosheth. Ziba had two donkeys that were carrying two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred handfuls of raisins, a hundred figs, and some wine."
2 Samuel,16,2,"“What's all this?” David asked. Ziba said, “The donkeys are for your family to ride. The bread and fruit are for the people to eat, and the wine is for them to drink in the desert when they are tired out.”"
2 Samuel,16,3,"“And where is Mephibosheth?” David asked. Ziba answered, “He stayed in Jerusalem, because he thinks the people of Israel want him to rule the kingdom of his grandfather Saul.”"
2 Samuel,16,4,"David then told him, “Everything that used to belong to Mephibosheth is now yours.” Ziba said, “Your Majesty, I am your humble servant, and I hope you will be pleased with me.”"
2 Samuel,16,5,"David was near the town of Bahurim when a man came out and started cursing him. The man was Shimei the son of Gera, and he was one of Saul's distant relatives."
2 Samuel,16,6,"He threw stones at David, at his soldiers, and at everyone else, including the bodyguards who walked on each side of David."
2 Samuel,16,7,"Shimei was yelling at David, “Get out of here, you murderer! You good-for-nothing,"
2 Samuel,16,8,"the LORD is paying you back for killing so many in Saul's family. You stole his kingdom, but now the LORD has given it to your son Absalom. You're a murderer, and that's why you're in such big trouble!”"
2 Samuel,16,9,"Abishai said, “Your Majesty, this man is as useless as a dead dog! He shouldn't be allowed to curse you. Let me go over and chop off his head.”"
2 Samuel,16,10,"David replied, “What will I ever do with you and your brother Joab? If Shimei is cursing me because the LORD has told him to, then who are you to tell him to stop?”"
2 Samuel,16,11,Then David said to Abishai and all his soldiers: My own son is trying to kill me! Why shouldn't this man from the tribe of Benjamin want me dead even more? Let him curse all he wants. Perhaps the LORD did tell him to curse me.
2 Samuel,16,12,"But if the LORD hears these curses and sees the trouble I'm in, perhaps he will have pity on me instead."
2 Samuel,16,13,"David and the others went on down the road. Shimei went along the hillside by the road, cursing and throwing stones and earth at them."
2 Samuel,16,14,"When David and those with him came to the River Jordan, they were tired out. But after they rested, they felt much better."
2 Samuel,16,15,"By this time, Absalom, Ahithophel, and the others had reached Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,16,16,"David's friend Hushai came to Absalom and said, “Long live the king! Long live the king!”"
2 Samuel,16,17,"But Absalom asked Hushai, “Is this how you show loyalty to your friend David? Why didn't you go with him?”"
2 Samuel,16,18,"Hushai answered, “The LORD and the people of Israel have chosen you to be king. I can't leave. I have to stay and serve the one they've chosen."
2 Samuel,16,19,"Besides, it seems right for me to serve you, just as I served your father.”"
2 Samuel,16,20,"Absalom turned to Ahithophel and said, “Give us your advice! What should we do?”"
2 Samuel,16,21,"Ahithophel answered, “Some of your father's wives were left here to take care of the palace. You should have sex with them. Then everyone will find out that you have publicly disgraced your father. This will make you and your followers even more powerful.”"
2 Samuel,16,22,"Absalom had a tent set up on the flat roof of the palace, and everyone watched as he went into the tent with his father's wives."
2 Samuel,16,23,Ahithophel gave such good advice in those days that both Absalom and David thought it came straight from God.
2 Samuel,17,1,"Ahithophel said to Absalom: Let me choose twelve thousand men and attack David tonight,"
2 Samuel,17,2,"while he is tired and discouraged. He will panic, and everyone with him will run away. I won't kill anyone except David,"
2 Samuel,17,3,since he's the one you want to get rid of. Then I'll bring the whole nation back to you like a bride coming home to her husband. This way there won't be a civil war.
2 Samuel,17,4,Absalom and all the leaders of the tribes of Israel agreed that Ahithophel had a good plan.
2 Samuel,17,5,"Then Absalom said, “Bring in Hushai the Archite. Let's hear what he has to say.”"
2 Samuel,17,6,"Hushai came in, and Absalom told him what Ahithophel had planned. Then Absalom said, “Should we do what he says? And if we shouldn't, can you come up with anything better?”"
2 Samuel,17,7,Hushai said: This time Ahithophel's advice isn't so good.
2 Samuel,17,8,"You know that your father and his followers are real warriors. Now they are as fierce as a mother bear whose cubs have just been killed. Besides, your father has a lot of experience in fighting wars, and he won't be spending the night with the others."
2 Samuel,17,9,"He has probably already found a hiding place in a cave or somewhere else. As soon as anyone hears that some of your soldiers have been killed, everyone will think your whole army has been destroyed."
2 Samuel,17,10,Then even those who are as brave as a lion will lose their courage. All Israel knows what a great warrior your father is and what brave soldiers he has.
2 Samuel,17,11,"My advice is to gather all the fighting men of Israel from the town of Dan in the north down to the town of Beersheba in the south. You will have more soldiers than there are grains of sand on the seashore. Absalom, you should lead them yourself,"
2 Samuel,17,12,and we will all go to fight David wherever he is. We will fall on him just as dew falls and covers the ground. He and all his soldiers will die!
2 Samuel,17,13,"If they go into a walled town, we will put ropes around that town and drag it into the river. We won't leave even one small piece of a stone."
2 Samuel,17,14,Absalom and the others liked Hushai's plan better than Ahithophel's plan. This was because the LORD had decided to keep Ahithophel's plan from working and to cause trouble for Absalom.
2 Samuel,17,15,"Straight away, Hushai went to Zadok and Abiathar. He told them what advice Ahithophel had given to Absalom and to the leaders of Israel. He also told them about the advice he had given."
2 Samuel,17,16,"Then he said, “Hurry! Send someone to warn David not to spend the night on this side of the river. He must get across the river, so he and the others won't be wiped out!”"
2 Samuel,17,17,Jonathan and Ahimaaz had been waiting at Rogel Spring because they did not want to be seen in Jerusalem. A servant girl went to the spring and gave them the message for David.
2 Samuel,17,18,But a young man saw them and went to tell Absalom. So Jonathan and Ahimaaz left and hurried to the house of a man who lived in Bahurim. Then they climbed down into a well in the courtyard.
2 Samuel,17,19,"The man's wife put the cover on the well and poured grain on top of it, so the well could not be seen."
2 Samuel,17,20,"Absalom's soldiers came to the woman and demanded, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?” The woman answered, “They went across the stream.” The soldiers went off to look for the two men. But when they did not find the men, they went back to Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,17,21,"After the soldiers had gone, Jonathan and Ahimaaz climbed out of the well. They went to David and said, “Hurry! Get ready to cross the river!” Then they told him about Ahithophel's plan."
2 Samuel,17,22,David and the others got ready and started crossing the River Jordan. By sunrise all of them were on the other side.
2 Samuel,17,23,"When Ahithophel saw that Absalom and the leaders of Israel were not going to follow his advice, he saddled his donkey and rode back to his home in Gilo. He told his family and servants what to do. Then he hanged himself, and they buried him in his family's burial place."
2 Samuel,17,24,"David went to the town of Mahanaim, and Absalom crossed the River Jordan with the army of Israel."
2 Samuel,17,25,"Absalom put Amasa in Joab's place as commander of the army. Amasa's father was Ithra from the family of Ishmael, and his mother was Abigal, the daughter of Nahash and the sister of Joab's mother Zeruiah."
2 Samuel,17,26,The Israelites under Absalom's command set up camp in the region of Gilead.
2 Samuel,17,27,"After David came to the town of Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash came from Rabbah in Ammon, Machir the son of Ammiel came from Lo-Debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite came from Rogelim."
2 Samuel,18,1,David divided his soldiers into groups of a hundred and groups of a thousand. Then he chose officers to be in command of each group.
2 Samuel,18,2,"He sent out one third of his army under the command of Joab, another third under the command of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, and the rest under the command of Ittai from Gath. He told the soldiers, “I'm going into battle with you.”"
2 Samuel,18,3,"But the soldiers said, “No, don't go into battle with us! It won't matter to our enemies if they make us all run away, or even if they kill half of us. But you are worth ten thousand of us. It would be better for you to stay in town and send help if we need it.”"
2 Samuel,19,1,"Someone told Joab, “The king is crying because Absalom is dead.”"
2 Samuel,19,2,"David's army found out he was crying because his son had died, and their day of victory suddenly turned into a day of sadness."
2 Samuel,19,3,"The troops were sneaking into Mahanaim, just as if they had run away from a battle and were ashamed."
2 Samuel,19,4,"David held his hands over his face and kept on crying loudly, “My son, Absalom! Absalom, my son, my son!”"
2 Samuel,19,5,"Joab went to the house where David was staying and told him: You've made your soldiers ashamed! Not only did they save your life, they saved your sons and daughters and wives as well."
2 Samuel,19,6,"You're more loyal to your enemies than to your friends. What you've done today has shown your officers and soldiers that they don't mean a thing to you. You would be happy if Absalom was still alive, even if the rest of us were dead."
2 Samuel,19,7,"Now get up! Go out there and thank them for what they did. If you don't, I swear by the LORD that you won't even have one man left on your side tomorrow morning. You may have had a lot of troubles in the past, but this will be the worst thing that has ever happened to you!"
2 Samuel,19,8,"David got up and went to the town gate and sat down. When the people heard that he was sitting there, they came to see him. After Israel's soldiers had all returned home,"
2 Samuel,20,1,"A troublemaker from the tribe of Benjamin was there. His name was Sheba the son of Bichri, and he blew a trumpet to get everyone's attention. Then he said, “People of Israel, David the son of Jesse doesn't belong to us! Let's go home.”"
2 Samuel,20,2,So they stopped following David and went off with Sheba. But the people of Judah stayed close to David all the way from the Jordan to Jerusalem.
2 Samuel,20,3,"David had left ten of his wives in Jerusalem to take care of his palace. But when he came back, he had them taken to another house, and he placed soldiers there to guard them. He gave them whatever they needed, but he never slept with any of them again. They had to live there for the rest of their lives as if they were widows."
2 Samuel,20,4,"David said to Amasa, “Three days from now I want you and all of Judah's army to be here!”"
2 Samuel,20,5,"Amasa started bringing the army together, but it was taking him more than three days."
2 Samuel,20,6,"So David said to Abishai, “Sheba will hurt us more than Absalom ever did. Take my best soldiers and go after him. We don't want him to take over any walled cities and get away from us.”"
2 Samuel,20,7,"Abishai left Jerusalem to try and capture Sheba. He took along Joab and his soldiers, as well as David's bodyguard and best troops."
2 Samuel,20,8,"They had gone as far as the big rock at Gibeon when Amasa caught up with them. Joab had a dagger strapped around his waist over his military uniform, but it fell out as he started towards Amasa."
2 Samuel,20,9,"Joab said, “Amasa, my cousin, how are you?” Then Joab took hold of Amasa's beard with his right hand, so that he could greet him with a kiss."
2 Samuel,20,10,"Amasa did not see the dagger in Joab's other hand. Joab stuck it in Amasa's stomach, and his insides spilt out on the ground. Joab only struck him once, but Amasa was dying. Joab and his brother Abishai went off to chase Sheba."
2 Samuel,20,11,"One of Joab's soldiers stood by Amasa and shouted, “If any of you like Joab, and if you are for David, then follow Joab!”"
2 Samuel,20,12,"Amasa was still rolling in his own blood in the middle of the road. The soldier who had shouted noticed that everyone who passed by would stop, so he dragged Amasa off the road and covered him with a blanket."
2 Samuel,20,13,"After this, no one else stopped. They all walked straight past him on their way to help Joab capture Sheba."
2 Samuel,20,14,Sheba had gone through all the tribes of Israel when he came to the town of Abel Beth-Maacah. All his best soldiers met him there and followed him into the town.
2 Samuel,20,15,"Joab and his troops came and surrounded Abel, so that no one could go in or come out. They made an earth ramp up to the town wall and then started to use a battering ram to knock the wall down."
2 Samuel,20,16,"A wise woman shouted from the top of the wall, “Listen to me! Listen to me! I have to talk to Joab! Tell him to come here!”"
2 Samuel,20,17,"When he came, the woman said, “Are you Joab?” “Yes, I am,” he answered. She said, “Please, listen to what I have to say.” “All right,” he said. “I'll listen.”"
2 Samuel,20,18,"She said, “Long ago people used to say, ‘If you want good advice, go to the town of Abel to get it.’ The answers they got here were all that was needed to settle any problem."
2 Samuel,20,19,"We are Israelites, and we want peace! You can trust us. Why are you trying to destroy a town that's like a mother in Israel? Why do you want to wipe out the LORD 's people?”"
2 Samuel,20,20,"Joab answered, “No, no! I'm not trying to wipe you out or destroy your town!"
2 Samuel,20,21,"That's not it at all. There's a man in your town from the hill country of Ephraim. His name is Sheba, and he is the leader of a rebellion against King David. Turn him over to me, and we will leave your town alone.” The woman told Joab, “We will throw his head over the wall.”"
2 Samuel,20,22,"She went to the people of the town and talked them into doing it. They cut off Sheba's head and threw it to Joab. Joab blew a signal on his trumpet, and the soldiers returned to their homes. Joab went back to David in Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,20,23,Joab was the commander of Israel's entire army. Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was in command of David's bodyguard.
2 Samuel,20,24,Adoram was in charge of the slave labour force. Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud kept government records.
2 Samuel,20,25,Sheva was the secretary. Zadok and Abiathar were the priests.
2 Samuel,20,26,Ira from Jair was David's priest.
2 Samuel,21,1,"While David was king, there were three years in a row when the nation of Israel could not grow enough food. So David asked the LORD for help, and the LORD answered, “Saul and his family are guilty of murder, because he had the Gibeonites killed.”"
2 Samuel,21,2,"The Gibeonites were not Israelites; they were descendants of the Amorites. The people of Israel had promised not to kill them, but Saul had tried to kill them because he wanted Israel and Judah to control all the land. David called the Gibeonites to him, and he talked with them."
2 Samuel,21,3,"He said, “What can I do to make up for what Saul did, so that you'll ask the LORD to be kind to his people again?”"
2 Samuel,21,4,"The Gibeonites answered, “Silver and gold from Saul and his family are not enough. On the other hand, we don't have the right to put any Israelite to death.” David said, “I'll do whatever you ask.”"
2 Samuel,21,5,"They replied, “Saul tried to kill all our people so that none of us would be left in the land of Israel."
2 Samuel,21,6,"Give us seven of his descendants. We will hang these men near the place where the LORD is worshipped in Gibeah, the home town of Saul, the LORD 's chosen king.” “I'll give them to you,” David said."
2 Samuel,21,7,"David had made a promise to Jonathan with the LORD as his witness, so he spared Jonathan's son Mephibosheth, the grandson of Saul."
2 Samuel,21,8,But Saul and Rizpah the daughter of Aiah had two sons named Armoni and Mephibosheth. Saul's daughter Merab had five sons whose father was Adriel the son of Barzillai from Meholah. David took Rizpah's two sons and Merab's five sons and
2 Samuel,21,9,"turned them over to the Gibeonites, who hanged all seven of them on the mountain near the place where the LORD was worshipped. This happened right at the beginning of the barley harvest."
2 Samuel,21,10,"Rizpah spread out some sackcloth on a nearby rock. She wouldn't let the birds land on the bodies during the day, and she kept the wild animals away at night. She stayed there from the beginning of the harvest until it started to rain."
2 Samuel,22,1,"David sang a song to the LORD after the LORD had rescued him from his enemies, especially Saul. These are the words to David's song:"
2 Samuel,22,2,"Our LORD and our God, you are my mighty rock, my fortress, my protector."
2 Samuel,22,3,"You are the rock where I am safe. You are my shield, my powerful weapon, and my place of shelter. You rescue me and keep me from being hurt."
2 Samuel,22,4,"I praise you, our LORD! I prayed to you, and you rescued me from my enemies."
2 Samuel,22,5,"Death, like ocean waves, surrounded me, and I was almost swallowed by its flooding waters."
2 Samuel,22,6,"Ropes from the world of the dead had coiled around me, and death had set a trap in my path."
2 Samuel,22,7,"I was in terrible trouble when I called out to you, but from your temple you heard me and answered my prayer."
2 Samuel,22,8,Earth shook and shivered! The columns supporting the sky rocked back and forth. You were angry
2 Samuel,22,9,and breathed out smoke. Scorching heat and fiery flames spewed from your mouth.
2 Samuel,22,10,"You opened the heavens like curtains, and you came down with storm clouds under your feet."
2 Samuel,22,11,You rode on the backs of flying creatures. You appeared with the wind as wings.
2 Samuel,22,12,"Darkness was your tent! Thunderclouds filled the sky, hiding you from sight."
2 Samuel,22,13,Fiery coals lit up the sky in front of you.
2 Samuel,22,14," LORD Most High, your voice thundered from the heavens."
2 Samuel,22,15,You scattered your enemies with arrows of lightning.
2 Samuel,22,16,"You roared at the sea, and its deepest channels could be seen. You snorted, and the earth shook to its foundations."
2 Samuel,22,17,"You reached down from heaven, and you lifted me from deep in the ocean."
2 Samuel,22,18,You rescued me from enemies who were hateful and too powerful for me.
2 Samuel,22,19,"On the day disaster struck, they came and attacked, but you defended me."
2 Samuel,22,20,"When I was fenced in, you freed and rescued me because you love me."
2 Samuel,22,21,"You are good to me, LORD, because I do right, and you reward me because I am innocent."
2 Samuel,22,22,I do what you want and never turn to do evil.
2 Samuel,22,23,I keep your laws in mind and never turn away from your teachings.
2 Samuel,22,24,I obey you completely and guard against sin.
2 Samuel,22,25,You have been good to me because I do right; you have rewarded me for being innocent by your standards.
2 Samuel,22,26,"You are always loyal to your loyal people, and you are faithful to the faithful."
2 Samuel,22,27,"With all who are sincere you are sincere, but you treat the unfaithful as their deeds deserve."
2 Samuel,22,28,"You rescue the humble, but you look for ways to put down the proud."
2 Samuel,22,29,"Our LORD and God, you are my lamp. You turn darkness to light."
2 Samuel,22,30,You help me defeat armies and capture cities.
2 Samuel,22,31,"Your way is perfect, LORD, and your word is correct. You are a shield for those who run to you for help."
2 Samuel,22,32,You alone are God! Only you are a mighty rock.
2 Samuel,22,33,"You are my strong fortress, and you set me free."
2 Samuel,22,34,"You make my feet run as fast as those of a deer, and you help me stand on the mountains."
2 Samuel,22,35,You teach my hands to fight and my arms to use a bow of bronze.
2 Samuel,22,36,"You alone are my shield, and by coming to help me, you have made me famous."
2 Samuel,22,37,"You clear the way for me, and now I won't stumble."
2 Samuel,22,38,I kept chasing my enemies until I caught them and destroyed them.
2 Samuel,22,39,"I destroyed them! I stuck my sword through my enemies, and they were crushed under my feet."
2 Samuel,22,40,You helped me win victories and forced my attackers to fall victim to me.
2 Samuel,22,41,"You made my enemies run, and I killed them."
2 Samuel,22,42,"They cried out for help, but no one saved them; they called out to you, but there was no answer."
2 Samuel,22,43,"I ground them to dust, and I squashed them like mud in the streets."
2 Samuel,22,44,"You rescued me from my stubborn people and made me the leader of foreign nations, who are now my slaves."
2 Samuel,22,45,They obey and come crawling.
2 Samuel,22,46,They have lost all courage and from their fortresses they come trembling.
2 Samuel,22,47,You are the living LORD! I will praise you! You are a mighty rock. I will honour you for keeping me safe.
2 Samuel,22,48,"You took revenge for me, and you put nations in my power."
2 Samuel,22,49,"You protected me from violent enemies, and you made me much greater than all of them."
2 Samuel,22,50,"I will praise you, LORD, and I will honour you among the nations."
2 Samuel,22,51,You give glorious victories to your chosen king. Your faithful love for David and for his descendants will never end.
2 Samuel,23,1,"These are the last words of David the son of Jesse. The God of Jacob chose David and made him a great king. The Mighty God of Israel loved him. When God told him to speak, David said:"
2 Samuel,23,2,The Spirit of the LORD has told me what to say.
2 Samuel,23,3,"Our Mighty Rock, the God of Jacob, told me, “A ruler who obeys God and does right"
2 Samuel,23,4,"is like the sunrise on a cloudless day, or like rain that sparkles on the grass.”"
2 Samuel,23,5,"I have ruled this way, and God will never break his promise to me. God's promise is complete and unchanging; he will always help me and give me what I hope for."
2 Samuel,23,6,"But evil people are pulled up like thorn bushes. They are not dug up by hand,"
2 Samuel,23,7,but with a sharp spear and are burnt on the spot.
2 Samuel,23,8,"These are the names of David's warriors: Ishbosheth the son of Hachmon was the leader of the Three Warriors. In one battle, he killed eight hundred men with his spear."
2 Samuel,23,9,"The next one of the Three Warriors was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite. One time when the Philistines were at war with Israel, he and David dared the Philistines to fight them. Every one of the Israelite soldiers turned and ran,"
2 Samuel,23,10,"except Eleazar. He killed Philistines until his hand was cramped, and he couldn't let go of his sword. When Eleazar finished, all the Israelite troops had to do was come back and take the enemies' weapons and armour. The LORD gave Israel a great victory that day."
2 Samuel,23,11,"Next was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. One time the Philistines brought their army together to destroy a crop of peas growing in a field near Lehi. The rest of Israel's soldiers ran away from the Philistines,"
2 Samuel,23,12,"but Shammah stood in the middle of the field and killed the Philistines. The crops were saved, and the LORD gave Israel a great victory."
2 Samuel,23,13,"One year at harvest time, the Three Warriors went to meet David at Adullam Cave. The Philistine army had set up camp in Rephaim Valley"
2 Samuel,23,14,"and had taken over Bethlehem. David was in his fortress,"
2 Samuel,23,15,"and he was very thirsty. He said, “I wish I had a drink from the well by the gate at Bethlehem.”"
2 Samuel,23,16,"The Three Warriors sneaked into the Philistine camp and got some water from the well near Bethlehem's gate. But after they brought the water back to David, he refused to drink it. Instead, he poured it out as a sacrifice"
2 Samuel,23,17,"and said to the LORD , “I can't drink this water! It's like the blood of these men who risked their lives to get it for me.” The Three Warriors did these brave deeds."
2 Samuel,23,18,"Joab's brother Abishai was the leader of the Thirty Warriors, and in one battle he killed three hundred men with his spear. He was as famous as the Three Warriors"
2 Samuel,23,19,"and certainly just as famous as the rest of the Thirty Warriors. He was the commander of the Thirty Warriors, but he still did not become one of the Three Warriors."
2 Samuel,23,20,"Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was a brave man from Kabzeel who did some amazing things. He killed two of Moab's best fighters, and on a snowy day he went down into a pit and killed a lion."
2 Samuel,23,21,"Another time, he killed an Egyptian, as big as a giant. The Egyptian was armed with a spear, but Benaiah only had a club. Benaiah grabbed the spear from the Egyptian and killed him with it."
2 Samuel,24,1,"The LORD was angry with Israel again, and he made David think it would be a good idea to count the people in Israel and Judah."
2 Samuel,24,2,"So David told Joab and the army officers, “Go to every tribe in Israel, from the town of Dan in the north all the way south to Beersheba, and count everyone who can serve in the army. I want to know how many there are.”"
2 Samuel,24,3,"Joab answered, “I hope the LORD your God will give you a hundred times more soldiers than you already have. I hope you will live to see that day! But why do you want to do a thing like this?”"
2 Samuel,24,4,"But when David refused to change his mind, Joab and the army officers went out and started counting the people."
2 Samuel,24,5,They crossed the River Jordan and began with Aroer and the town in the middle of the river valley. From there they went towards Gad and on as far as Jazer.
2 Samuel,24,6,"They went to Gilead and to Kadesh in Syria. Then they went to Dan, Ijon, and on towards Sidon."
2 Samuel,24,7,"They came to the fortress of Tyre, then went through every town of the Hivites and the Canaanites. Finally, they went to Beersheba in the Southern Desert of Judah."
2 Samuel,24,8,"After they had gone through the whole land, they went back to Jerusalem. It had taken them nine months and twenty days."
2 Samuel,24,9,"Joab came and told David, “In Israel there are eight hundred thousand who can serve in the army, and in Judah there are five hundred thousand.”"
2 Samuel,24,10,"After David had everyone counted, he felt guilty and told the LORD , “What I did was stupid and terribly wrong. LORD , please forgive me.”"
2 Samuel,24,11,"Before David even got up the next morning, the LORD had told David's prophet Gad"
1 Kings,1,1,"King David was now an old man, and he always felt cold, even under a lot of blankets."
1 Kings,1,2,"His officials said, “Your Majesty, we will look for a young woman to take care of you. She can lie down beside you and keep you warm.”"
1 Kings,2,1,"Not long before David died, he told Solomon:"
1 Kings,2,2,"My son, I will soon die, as everyone must. But I want you to be strong and brave."
1 Kings,2,3,"Do what the LORD your God commands and follow his teachings. Obey everything written in the Law of Moses. Then you will be a success, no matter what you do or where you go."
1 Kings,2,4,"You and your descendants must always faithfully obey the LORD . If you do, he will keep the solemn promise he made to me that someone from our family will always be king of Israel."
1 Kings,2,5,"Solomon, don't forget what Joab did to me by killing Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether, the two commanders of Israel's army. He killed them as if they were his enemies in a war, but he did it when there was no war. He is guilty, and now it's up to you to punish him"
1 Kings,2,6,"in the way you think best. Whatever you do, don't let him die peacefully in his old age."
1 Kings,2,7,The sons of Barzillai from Gilead helped me when I was running from your brother Absalom. Be kind to them and let them eat at your table.
1 Kings,2,8,"Be sure to do something about Shimei son of Gera from Bahurim in the territory of Benjamin. He cursed and insulted me the day I went to Mahanaim. But later, when he came to meet me at the River Jordan, I promised that I wouldn't kill him."
1 Kings,2,9,"Now you must punish him. He's an old man, but you're wise enough to know that you must have him killed."
1 Kings,3,1,"Solomon signed a treaty with the king of Egypt and married his daughter. She lived in the older part of Jerusalem until the palace, the LORD 's temple, and the wall around Jerusalem were completed."
1 Kings,3,2,"At that time, there was no temple for worshipping the LORD , and everyone offered sacrifices at the local shrines."
1 Kings,3,3,"Solomon loved the LORD and followed his father David's instructions, but Solomon also offered sacrifices and burnt incense at the shrines."
1 Kings,3,4,"The most important shrine was in Gibeon, and Solomon had offered more than a thousand sacrifices on that altar."
1 Kings,3,5,"One night while Solomon was in Gibeon, the LORD God appeared to him in a dream and said, “Solomon, ask for anything you want, and I will give it to you.”"
1 Kings,3,6,"Solomon answered: My father David, your servant, was honest and did what you commanded. You were always loyal to him, and you gave him a son who is now king."
1 Kings,3,7,"LORD God, I'm your servant, and you've made me king in my father's place. But I'm very young and know so little about being a leader."
1 Kings,3,8,"And now I must rule your chosen people, even though there are too many of them to count."
1 Kings,3,9,"Please make me wise and teach me the difference between right and wrong. Then I will know how to rule your people. If you don't, there is no way I could rule this great nation of yours."
1 Kings,5,1,"King Hiram of Tyre had always been friends with Solomon's father David. When Hiram learnt that Solomon was king, he sent some of his officials to meet with Solomon."
1 Kings,5,2,Solomon sent a message back to Hiram:
1 Kings,5,3,"Remember how my father David wanted to build a temple where the LORD his God could be worshipped? But enemies kept attacking my father's kingdom, and he never had the chance."
1 Kings,5,4,"Now, thanks to the LORD God, there is peace in my kingdom and no trouble or threat of war anywhere."
1 Kings,5,5,"The LORD God promised my father that when his son became king, he would build a temple for worshipping the LORD . So I've decided to do that."
1 Kings,5,6,I'd like you to send your workers to cut down cedar trees in Lebanon for me. I will pay them whatever you say and will even make my workers help them. We both know that your workers are more experienced than anyone else at cutting timber.
1 Kings,5,7,"Hiram was so happy when he heard Solomon's request that he said, “I am grateful that the Lord gave David such a wise son to be king of that great nation!”"
1 Kings,5,8,Then he sent back his answer: I received your message and will give you all the cedar and pine logs you need.
1 Kings,5,9,"My workers will carry them down from Lebanon to the Mediterranean Sea. They will tie the logs together and float them along the coast to wherever you want them. Then they will untie the logs, and your workers can take them from there. To pay for the logs, you can provide the grain I need for my household."
1 Kings,5,10,Hiram gave Solomon all the cedar and pine logs he needed.
1 Kings,5,11,"In return, Solomon gave Hiram two thousand tonnes of wheat and four hundred thousand litres of pure olive oil each year."
1 Kings,5,12,The LORD kept his promise and made Solomon wise. Hiram and Solomon signed a treaty and never went to war against each other.
1 Kings,5,13,"Solomon ordered thirty thousand people from all over Israel to cut logs for the temple,"
1 Kings,5,14,and he put Adoniram in charge of these workers. Solomon divided them into three groups of ten thousand. Each group worked one month in Lebanon and had two months off at home.
1 Kings,5,15,"He also had eighty thousand workers to cut stone in the hill country of Israel, seventy thousand workers to carry the stones,"
1 Kings,5,16,and over three thousand assistants to keep track of the work and to supervise the workers.
1 Kings,5,17,He ordered the workers to cut and shape large blocks of good stone for the foundation of the temple.
1 Kings,5,18,"Solomon's and Hiram's men worked with men from the city of Gebal, and together they got the stones and logs ready for the temple."
1 Kings,6,1,"Solomon's workers started building the temple during Ziv, the second month of the year. It had been four years since Solomon became king of Israel, and four hundred and eighty years since the people of Israel left Egypt."
1 Kings,6,2,"The inside of the LORD 's temple was twenty-seven metres long, nine metres wide, and thirteen and a half metres high."
1 Kings,6,3,A four and a half metre porch went all the way across the front of the temple.
1 Kings,6,4,The windows were narrow on the outside but wide on the inside.
1 Kings,7,1,Solomon's palace took thirteen years to build.
1 Kings,9,1,"The LORD 's temple and Solomon's palace were now finished, and Solomon had built everything he wanted."
1 Kings,9,2,"Some time later the LORD appeared to him again in a dream, just as he had done at Gibeon."
1 Kings,9,3,"The LORD said: I heard your prayer and what you asked me to do. This temple you have built is where I will be worshipped for ever. It belongs to me, and I will never stop watching over it."
1 Kings,9,4,"You must obey me, as your father David did, and be honest and fair. Obey my laws and teachings,"
1 Kings,9,5,and I will keep my promise to David that someone from your family will always be king of Israel.
1 Kings,9,6,"But if you or any of your descendants disobey my commands or start worshipping foreign gods,"
1 Kings,9,7,I will no longer let my people Israel live in this land I gave them. I will desert this temple where I said I would be worshipped. Then people everywhere will think this nation is only a joke and will make fun of it.
1 Kings,9,8,"This temple will become a pile of rocks! Everyone who walks by will be shocked, and they will ask, “Why did the LORD do such a terrible thing to his people and to this temple?”"
1 Kings,9,9,"Then they will answer, “We know why the LORD did this. The people of Israel rejected the LORD their God, who rescued their ancestors from Egypt, and they started worshipping other gods.”"
1 Kings,9,10,It took twenty years for the LORD 's temple and Solomon's palace to be built.
1 Kings,9,11,"Later, Solomon gave King Hiram of Tyre twenty towns in the region of Galilee to repay him for the cedar, pine, and gold he had given Solomon."
1 Kings,9,12,"When Hiram went to see the towns, he did not like them."
1 Kings,9,13,"He said, “Solomon, my friend, are these the kind of towns you want to give me?” So Hiram called the region Cabul because he thought it was worthless."
1 Kings,9,14,He sent Solomon only five thousand kilogrammes of gold in return.
1 Kings,9,15,"After Solomon's workers had finished the temple and the palace, he ordered them to fill in the land on the east side of Jerusalem, to build a wall around the city, and to rebuild the towns of Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer."
1 Kings,9,16,"Earlier, the king of Egypt had captured the town of Gezer; he burnt it to the ground and killed the Canaanite people living there. Then he gave it to his daughter as a wedding present when she married Solomon."
1 Kings,9,17,"So Solomon had the town rebuilt. Solomon made his workers rebuild Lower Beth-Horon,"
1 Kings,9,18,"Baalath, and Tamar in the desert of Judah."
1 Kings,9,19,"They also built towns where he could keep his supplies and his chariots and horses. Solomon made them build whatever he wanted in Jerusalem, Lebanon, and anywhere in his kingdom."
1 Kings,10,1,"The Queen of Sheba heard how famous Solomon was, so she went to Jerusalem to test him with difficult questions."
1 Kings,10,2,"She took along several of her officials, and she loaded her camels with gifts of spices, jewels, and gold. When she arrived, she and Solomon talked about everything she could think of."
1 Kings,10,3,"He answered every question, no matter how difficult it was."
1 Kings,12,1,Rehoboam went to Shechem where everyone was waiting to crown him king.
1 Kings,12,2,"Jeroboam son of Nebat heard what was happening, and he stayed in Egypt, where he had gone to hide from Solomon."
1 Kings,12,3,"But the people from the northern tribes of Israel sent for him. Then together they went to Rehoboam and said,"
1 Kings,12,4,"“Your father Solomon forced us to work very hard. But if you make our work easier, we will serve you and do whatever you ask.”"
1 Kings,12,5,"“Give me three days to think about it,” Rehoboam replied, “then come back for my answer.” So the people left."
1 Kings,12,6,"Rehoboam went to some leaders who had been his father's senior officials, and he asked them, “What should I tell these people?”"
1 Kings,12,7,"They answered, “If you want them to serve and obey you, then you should do what they ask today. Tell them you will make their work easier.”"
1 Kings,12,8,But Rehoboam refused their advice and went to the younger men who had grown up with him and were now his officials.
1 Kings,12,9,"He asked, “What do you think I should say to these people who asked me to make their work easier?”"
1 Kings,12,10,"His younger advisers said: Here's what we think you should say to them: “Compared to me, my father was weak."
1 Kings,12,11,"He made you work hard, but I'll make you work even harder. He punished you with whips, but I'll use whips with pieces of sharp metal!”"
1 Kings,12,12,"Three days later, Jeroboam and the others came back."
1 Kings,12,13,Rehoboam ignored the advice of the older advisers.
1 Kings,12,14,"He spoke bluntly and told them exactly what his own advisers had suggested: “My father made you work hard, but I'll make you work even harder. He punished you with whips, but I'll use whips with pieces of sharp metal!”"
1 Kings,14,1,"About the same time, Abijah son of Jeroboam got sick."
1 Kings,15,1,"Abijam became king of Judah in Jeroboam's eighteenth year as king of Israel,"
1 Kings,15,2,and he ruled from Jerusalem for three years. His mother was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.
1 Kings,15,3,"Abijam did not truly obey the LORD his God as his ancestor David had done. Instead, he was sinful just like his father Rehoboam."
1 Kings,16,1,The LORD sent Jehu son of Hanani to say to Baasha:
1 Kings,16,2,"Nobody knew who you were until I, the LORD , chose you to be the leader of my people Israel. And now you're acting exactly like Jeroboam by causing the Israelites to sin. What you've done has made me so angry"
1 Kings,16,3,"that I will destroy you and your family, just as I did the family of Jeroboam."
1 Kings,16,4,"Dogs will eat the bodies of your relatives who die in town, and vultures will eat the bodies of those who die in the country."
1 Kings,17,1,"Elijah was a prophet from Tishbe in Gilead. One day he went to King Ahab and said, “I'm a servant of the living LORD , the God of Israel. And I swear in his name that it won't rain until I say so. There won't even be any dew on the ground.”"
1 Kings,17,2,"Later, the LORD said to Elijah,"
1 Kings,17,3,“Leave and go across the River Jordan so you can hide near Cherith Brook.
1 Kings,17,4,"You can drink water from the brook, and eat the food I've told the ravens to bring you.”"
1 Kings,17,5,Elijah obeyed the LORD and went to live near Cherith Brook.
1 Kings,17,6,"Ravens brought him bread and meat twice a day, and he drank water from the brook."
1 Kings,17,7,"But after a while, it dried up because there was no rain."
1 Kings,17,8,"The LORD told Elijah,"
1 Kings,17,9,“Go to the town of Zarephath in Sidon and live there. I've told a widow in that town to give you food.”
1 Kings,17,10,"When Elijah came near the town gate of Zarephath, he saw a widow gathering sticks for a fire. “Would you please bring me a cup of water?” he asked."
1 Kings,17,11,"As she left to get it, he asked, “Would you also please bring me a piece of bread?”"
1 Kings,17,12,"The widow answered, “In the name of the living LORD your God, I swear that I don't have any bread. All I have is a handful of flour and a little olive oil. I'm on my way home now with these few sticks to cook what I have for my son and me. After that, we will starve to death.”"
1 Kings,17,13,"Elijah said, “Everything will be fine. Do what you said. Go home and prepare something for yourself and your son. But first, please make a small piece of bread and bring it to me."
1 Kings,17,14,The LORD God of Israel has promised that your jar of flour won't run out and your bottle of oil won't dry up before he sends rain for the crops.”
1 Kings,17,15,The widow went home and did exactly what Elijah had told her. She and Elijah and her family had enough food for a long time.
1 Kings,17,16,"The LORD kept the promise that his prophet Elijah had made, and she did not run out of flour or oil."
1 Kings,17,17,"Several days later, the son of the woman who owned the house got sick, and he kept getting worse, until finally he died."
1 Kings,17,18,"The woman shouted at Elijah, “What have I done to you? I thought you were God's prophet. Did you come here to cause the death of my son as a reminder that I've sinned against God?”"
1 Kings,17,19,"“Bring me your son,” Elijah said. Then he took the boy from her arms and carried him upstairs to the room where he was staying. Elijah laid the boy on his bed"
1 Kings,17,20,"and prayed, “ LORD God, why did you do such a terrible thing to this woman? She's letting me stay here, and now you've let her son die.”"
1 Kings,17,21,"Elijah stretched himself out over the boy three times, while praying, “ LORD God, bring this boy back to life!”"
1 Kings,17,22,"The LORD answered Elijah's prayer, and the boy started breathing again."
1 Kings,17,23,"Elijah picked him up and carried him downstairs. He gave the boy to his mother and said, “Look, your son is alive.”"
1 Kings,17,24,“You are God's prophet!” the woman replied. “Now I know that you really do speak for the LORD .”
1 Kings,19,1,Ahab told his wife Jezebel what Elijah had done and that he had killed the prophets.
1 Kings,19,2,She sent a message to Elijah: “You killed my prophets. Now I'm going to kill you! I pray that the gods will punish me even more severely if I don't do it by this time tomorrow.”
1 Kings,19,3,"Elijah was afraid when he got her message, and he ran to the town of Beersheba in Judah. He left his servant there,"
1 Kings,19,4,"then walked another whole day into the desert. Finally, he came to a large bush and sat down in its shade. He begged the LORD , “I've had enough. Just let me die! I'm no better off than my ancestors.”"
1 Kings,19,5,"Then he lay down in the shade and fell asleep. Suddenly an angel woke him up and said, “Get up and eat.”"
1 Kings,19,6,"Elijah looked around, and by his head was a jar of water and some baked bread. He sat up, ate and drank, then lay down and went back to sleep."
1 Kings,19,7,"Soon the LORD 's angel woke him again and said, “Get up and eat, or else you'll get too tired to travel.”"
1 Kings,19,8,"So Elijah sat up and ate and drank. The food and water made him strong enough to walk forty more days. At last, he reached Mount Sinai, the mountain of God,"
1 Kings,19,9,"and he spent the night there in a cave. While Elijah was on Mount Sinai, the LORD asked, “Elijah, why are you here?”"
1 Kings,19,10,"He answered, “ LORD God All-Powerful, I've always done my best to obey you. But your people have broken their solemn promise to you. They have torn down your altars and killed all your prophets, except me. And now they are even trying to kill me!”"
1 Kings,19,11,"“Go out and stand on the mountain,” the LORD replied. “I want you to see me when I pass by.” All at once, a strong wind shook the mountain and shattered the rocks. But the LORD was not in the wind. Next, there was an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake."
1 Kings,19,12,"Then there was a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire. Finally, there was a gentle breeze,"
1 Kings,19,13,"and when Elijah heard it, he covered his face with his coat. He went out and stood at the entrance to the cave. The LORD asked, “Elijah, why are you here?”"
1 Kings,19,14,"Elijah answered, “ LORD God All-Powerful, I've always done my best to obey you. But your people have broken their solemn promise to you. They have torn down your altars and killed all your prophets, except me. And now they are even trying to kill me!”"
1 Kings,19,15,"The LORD said: Elijah, you can go back to the desert near Damascus. And when you get there, appoint Hazael to be king of Syria."
1 Kings,19,16,"Then appoint Jehu son of Nimshi to be king of Israel, and Elisha son of Shaphat to take your place as my prophet."
1 Kings,19,17,"Hazael will start killing the people who worship Baal. Jehu will kill those who escape from Hazael, and Elisha will kill those who escape from Jehu."
1 Kings,19,18,"But seven thousand Israelites have refused to worship Baal, and they will live."
1 Kings,19,19,"Elijah left and found Elisha ploughing a field with a pair of oxen. There were eleven other men in front of him, and each one was also ploughing with a pair of oxen. Elijah went over and put his own coat on Elisha."
1 Kings,19,20,"Elisha stopped ploughing and ran after him. “Let me kiss my parents goodbye, then I'll go with you,” he said. “You can go,” Elijah said. “But remember what I've done for you.”"
1 Kings,19,21,"Elisha left and took his oxen with him. He killed them and boiled them over a fire he had made with the wood from his plough. He gave the meat to the people who were with him, and they ate it. Then he left with Elijah and became his assistant."
1 Kings,20,1,"King Benhadad of Syria called his army together. He was joined by thirty-two other kings with their horses and chariots, and together they marched to Samaria and attacked."
1 Kings,20,2,"Benhadad sent a messenger to tell King Ahab of Israel,"
1 Kings,20,3,"“Ahab, give me your silver and gold, your wives, and your strongest sons!”"
1 Kings,20,4,"“Your Majesty,” Ahab replied, “everything I have is yours, including me.”"
1 Kings,20,5,"Later, Benhadad sent another messenger to say to Ahab, “I have already told you to give me your silver and gold, your wives, and your children."
1 Kings,20,6,"But tomorrow at this time, I will send my officials into your city to search your palace and the houses of your officials. They will take everything else that you own.”"
1 Kings,20,7,"Ahab called a meeting with the leaders of Israel and said, “Benhadad is causing real trouble. He told me to give him my wives and children, as well as my silver and gold. And I agreed.”"
1 Kings,20,8,“Don't listen to him!” they answered. “You don't have to do what he says.”
1 Kings,20,9,"So Ahab sent someone to tell Benhadad, “Your Majesty, I'll give you my silver and gold, and even my wives and children. But I won't let you have anything else.” When Benhadad got his answer,"
1 Kings,20,10,"he replied, “I'll completely destroy Samaria! There won't even be enough of it left for my soldiers to carry back in their hands. If I don't do it, I pray that the gods will punish me terribly.”"
1 Kings,20,11,"Ahab then answered, “Benhadad, don't boast before the fighting even begins. Wait and see if you live through it.”"
1 Kings,20,12,"Meanwhile, Benhadad and the other kings had been drinking in their tents. But when Ahab's reply came, he ordered his soldiers to prepare to attack Samaria, and they all got ready."
1 Kings,20,13,"At that very moment, a prophet ran up to Ahab and said, “You can see that Benhadad's army is very strong. But the LORD has promised to help you defeat them today. Then you will know that the LORD is in control.”"
1 Kings,20,14,"“Who will fight the battle?” Ahab asked. The prophet answered, “The young bodyguards who serve the district officials.” “But who will lead them into battle?” Ahab asked. “You will!” the prophet replied."
1 Kings,20,15,"So Ahab called together the two hundred and thirty-two young soldiers and the seven thousand troops in Israel's army, and he got them ready to fight the Syrians."
1 Kings,21,1,Naboth owned a vineyard in Jezreel near King Ahab's palace.
1 Kings,21,2,"One day, Ahab said, “Naboth, your vineyard is near my palace. Give it to me so I can turn it into a vegetable garden. I'll give you a better vineyard or pay whatever you want for yours.”"
1 Kings,21,3,"Naboth answered, “This vineyard has always been in my family. I won't let you have it.”"
1 Kings,21,4,"So Ahab went home, angry and depressed because of what Naboth had told him. He lay on his bed, just staring at the wall and refusing to eat a thing."
1 Kings,21,5,"Jezebel his wife came in and asked, “What's wrong? Why won't you eat?”"
1 Kings,21,6,"“I asked Naboth to sell me his vineyard or to let me give him a better one,” Ahab replied. “And he told me I couldn't have it.”"
1 Kings,21,7,"“Aren't you the king of Israel?” Jezebel asked. “Get out of bed and eat something! Don't worry, I'll get Naboth's vineyard for you.”"
1 Kings,22,1,For the next three years there was peace between Israel and Syria.
1 Kings,22,2,During the third year King Jehoshaphat of Judah went to visit King Ahab of Israel.
1 Kings,22,3,"Ahab asked his officials, “Why haven't we tried to get Ramoth in Gilead back from the Syrians? It belongs to us.”"
1 Kings,22,4,"Then he asked Jehoshaphat, “Would you go to Ramoth with me and attack the Syrians?” “Just tell me what to do,” Jehoshaphat answered. “My army and horses are at your command."
1 Kings,22,5,"But first, let's ask the LORD .”"
1 Kings,22,6,"Ahab sent for about four hundred prophets and asked, “Should I attack the Syrians at Ramoth?” “Yes!” the prophets answered. “The Lord will help you defeat them.”"
1 Kings,22,7,"But Jehoshaphat said, “Just to make sure, is there another of the LORD 's prophets we can ask?”"
1 Kings,22,8,"“We could ask Micaiah son of Imlah,” Ahab said. “But I hate Micaiah. He always has bad news for me.” “Don't say that!” Jehoshaphat replied."
1 Kings,22,9,Then Ahab sent someone to bring Micaiah as soon as possible.
1 Kings,22,10,"All this time, Ahab and Jehoshaphat were dressed in their royal robes and were seated on their thrones at the threshing place near the gate of Samaria. They were listening to the prophets tell them what the LORD had said."
1 Kings,22,11,"Zedekiah son of Chenaanah was one of the prophets. He had made some horns out of iron and shouted, “Ahab, the LORD says you will attack the Syrians like a bull with iron horns and wipe them out!”"
1 Kings,22,12,"All the prophets agreed that Ahab should attack the Syrians at Ramoth, and they promised that the LORD would help him defeat them."
1 Kings,22,13,"Meanwhile, the messenger who went to get Micaiah whispered, “Micaiah, all the prophets have good news for Ahab. Now go and say the same thing.”"
1 Kings,22,14,"“I'll say whatever the living LORD tells me to say,” Micaiah replied."
1 Kings,22,15,"Then Micaiah went to Ahab, and Ahab asked, “Micaiah, should I attack the Syrians at Ramoth?” “Yes!” Micaiah answered. “The LORD will help you defeat them.”"
1 Kings,22,16,"“Micaiah, I've told you over and over again to tell me the truth!” Ahab shouted. “What does the LORD really say?”"
1 Kings,22,17,"He answered, “In a vision I saw Israelite soldiers walking around in the hills like sheep without a shepherd to guide them. The LORD said, ‘This army has no leader. They should go home and not fight.’ ”"
1 Kings,22,18,"Ahab turned to Jehoshaphat and said, “I told you he would bring bad news!”"
1 Kings,22,19,Micaiah replied: Listen to this! I also saw the LORD seated on his throne with every creature in heaven gathered around him.
1 Kings,22,20,"The LORD asked, “Who can trick Ahab and make him go to Ramoth where he will be killed?” They talked about it for a while,"
1 Kings,22,21,"then finally a spirit came forward and said to the LORD , “I can trick Ahab.” “How?” the LORD asked."
1 Kings,22,22,“I'll make Ahab's prophets lie to him.” “Good!” the LORD replied. “Now go and do it.”
1 Kings,22,23,"This is exactly what has happened, Ahab. The LORD made all your prophets lie to you, and he knows you will soon be destroyed."
1 Kings,22,24,"Zedekiah walked up to Micaiah and slapped him on the face. Then he asked, “Do you really think the LORD would speak to you and not to me?”"
1 Kings,22,25,"Micaiah answered, “You'll find out on the day you have to hide in the back room of some house.”"
1 Kings,22,26,"Ahab shouted, “Arrest Micaiah! Take him to Prince Joash and Governor Amon of Samaria."
1 Kings,22,27,Tell them to put him in prison and to give him nothing but bread and water until I come back safely.”
1 Kings,22,28,"Micaiah said, “If you do come back, I was wrong about what the LORD wanted me to say.” Then he told the crowd, “Don't forget what I said!”"
1 Kings,22,29,Ahab and Jehoshaphat led their armies to Ramoth in Gilead.
1 Kings,22,30,"Before they went into battle, Ahab said, “Jehoshaphat, I'll disguise myself, but you wear your royal robe.” Then Ahab disguised himself and went into battle."
1 Kings,22,31,The king of Syria had ordered his thirty-two chariot commanders to attack only Ahab.
1 Kings,22,32,"So when they saw Jehoshaphat in his robe, they thought he was Ahab and started to attack him. But when Jehoshaphat shouted out to them,"
1 Kings,22,33,"they realized he wasn't Ahab, and they left him alone."
1 Kings,22,34,"However, during the fighting a soldier shot an arrow without even aiming, and it hit Ahab where two pieces of his armour joined. He shouted to his chariot driver, “I've been hit! Get me out of here!”"
1 Kings,22,35,"The fighting lasted all day, with Ahab propped up in his chariot so he could see the Syrian troops. He bled so much that the bottom of the chariot was covered with blood, and by evening he was dead."
1 Kings,22,36,"As the sun was going down, someone in Israel's army shouted to the others, “Retreat! Go back home!”"
1 Kings,22,37,Ahab's body was taken to Samaria and buried there.
1 Kings,22,38,"Some workers washed his chariot near a spring in Samaria, and prostitutes washed themselves in his blood. Dogs licked Ahab's blood off the ground, just as the LORD had warned."
1 Kings,22,39,"Everything else Ahab did while he was king, including the towns he strengthened and the palace he built and furnished with ivory, is written in The History of the Kings of Israel."
1 Kings,22,40,"Ahab died, and his son Ahaziah became king."
1 Kings,22,41,Jehoshaphat son of Asa became king of Judah in Ahab's fourth year as king of Israel.
1 Kings,22,42,"Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he ruled from Jerusalem for twenty-five years. His mother was Azubah daughter of Shilhi."
2 Kings,2,1,"Not long before the LORD took Elijah up into heaven in a strong wind, Elijah and Elisha were leaving Gilgal."
2 Kings,2,2,"Elijah said to Elisha, “The LORD wants me to go to Bethel, but you must stay here.” Elisha replied, “I swear by the living LORD and by your own life that I will stay with you no matter what!” And he went with Elijah to Bethel."
2 Kings,2,3,"A group of prophets who lived there asked Elisha, “Do you know that today the LORD is going to take away your master?” “Yes, I do,” Elisha answered. “But don't remind me of it.”"
2 Kings,2,4,"Elijah then said, “Elisha, now the LORD wants me to go to Jericho, but you must stay here.” Elisha replied, “I swear by the living LORD and by your own life, that I will stay with you no matter what!” And he went with Elijah to Jericho."
2 Kings,2,5,"A group of prophets who lived there asked Elisha, “Do you know that today the LORD is going to take away your master?” “Yes, I do,” Elisha answered. “But don't remind me of it.”"
2 Kings,2,6,"Elijah then said to Elisha, “Now the LORD wants me to go to the River Jordan, but you must stay here.” Elisha replied, “I swear by the living LORD and by your own life that I will never leave you!” So the two of them walked on together."
2 Kings,2,7,"Fifty prophets followed Elijah and Elisha from Jericho, then stood at a distance and watched as the two men walked towards the river."
2 Kings,2,8,"When they got there, Elijah took off his coat, then he rolled it up and struck the water with it. At once a path opened up through the river, and the two of them walked across on dry ground."
2 Kings,2,9,"After they had reached the other side, Elijah said, “Elisha, the LORD will soon take me away. What can I do for you before that happens?” Elisha answered, “Please give me twice as much of your power as you give the other prophets, so I can be the one who takes your place as their leader.”"
2 Kings,2,10,"“It won't be easy,” Elijah answered. “It can happen only if you see me as I am being taken away.”"
2 Kings,2,11,"Elijah and Elisha were walking along and talking, when suddenly there appeared between them a flaming chariot pulled by fiery horses. Straight away, a strong wind took Elijah up into heaven."
2 Kings,2,12,"Elisha saw this and shouted, “Israel's cavalry and chariots have taken my master away!” After Elijah had gone, Elisha tore his clothes in sorrow."
2 Kings,2,13,"Elijah's coat had fallen off, so Elisha picked it up and walked back to the River Jordan."
2 Kings,2,14,"He struck the water with the coat and wondered, “Will the LORD perform miracles for me as he did for Elijah?” As soon as Elisha did this, a dry path opened up through the water, and he walked across."
2 Kings,2,15,"When the prophets from Jericho saw what happened, they said to each other, “Elisha now has Elijah's power.” They walked over to him, bowed down,"
2 Kings,2,16,"and said, “There are fifty strong men here with us. Please let them go and look for your master. Perhaps the Spirit of the LORD carried him off to some mountain or valley.” “No,” Elisha replied, “they won't find him.”"
2 Kings,2,17,"They kept begging until he was embarrassed to say no. He finally agreed, and the prophets sent the men out. They looked three days for Elijah but never found him."
2 Kings,2,18,"They returned to Jericho, and Elisha said, “I told you that you wouldn't find him.”"
2 Kings,2,19,"One day the people of Jericho said, “Elisha, you can see that our city is in a good spot. But the water from our spring is so bad that it even keeps our crops from growing.”"
2 Kings,2,20,"He replied, “Put some salt in a new bowl and bring it to me.” They brought him the bowl of salt,"
2 Kings,2,21,"and he carried it to the spring. He threw the salt into the water and said, “The LORD has made this water pure again. From now on you'll be able to grow crops, and no one will starve.”"
2 Kings,2,22,"The water has been fine ever since, just as Elisha said."
2 Kings,2,23,"Elisha left and headed towards Bethel. Along the way some boys started making fun of him by shouting, “Go away, baldy! Get out of here!”"
2 Kings,2,24,Elisha turned round and stared at the boys. Then he cursed them in the name of the LORD . Straight away two bears ran out of the woods and ripped to pieces forty-two of the boys.
2 Kings,2,25,"Elisha went up to Mount Carmel, then returned to Samaria."
2 Kings,3,1,Joram son of Ahab became king of Israel in Jehoshaphat's eighteenth year as king of Judah. Joram ruled twelve years from Samaria
2 Kings,3,2,"and disobeyed the LORD by doing wrong. He tore down the stone image his father had made to honour Baal, and so he wasn't as sinful as his parents."
2 Kings,3,3,But he kept doing the sinful things that Jeroboam son of Nebat had led Israel to do.
2 Kings,3,4,"For many years the country of Moab had been controlled by Israel and was forced to pay taxes to the kings of Israel. King Mesha of Moab raised sheep, so he paid the king of Israel one hundred thousand lambs and the wool from one hundred thousand rams."
2 Kings,3,5,"But soon after the death of Ahab, Mesha rebelled against Israel."
2 Kings,3,6,"One day, Joram left Samaria and called together Israel's army."
2 Kings,3,7,"He sent this message to King Jehoshaphat of Judah, “The king of Moab has rebelled. Will you go with me to attack him?” “Yes, I will,” Jehoshaphat answered. “I'm on your side, and my soldiers and horses are at your command."
2 Kings,3,8,"But which way should we go?” “We will march through Edom Desert,” Joram replied."
2 Kings,3,9,"So Joram, Jehoshaphat, and the king of Edom led their troops out. But seven days later, there was no drinking water left for them or their animals."
2 Kings,3,10,"Joram cried out, “This is terrible! The LORD must have led us out here to be captured by Moab's army.”"
2 Kings,3,11,"Jehoshaphat said, “Which of the LORD 's prophets is with us? We can find out from him what the LORD wants us to do.” One of Joram's officers answered, “Elisha son of Shaphat is here. He was one of Elijah's closest followers.”"
2 Kings,3,12,"Jehoshaphat replied, “He can give us the LORD 's message.” The three kings went over to Elisha,"
2 Kings,3,13,"and he asked Joram, “Why did you come to me? Go and talk to the prophets of the foreign gods your parents worshipped.” “No,” Joram answered. “It was the LORD who led us out here, so that Moab's army could capture us.”"
2 Kings,3,14,"Elisha said to him, “I serve the LORD All-Powerful, and as surely as he lives, I swear I wouldn't even look at you if I didn't respect King Jehoshaphat.”"
2 Kings,3,15,"Then Elisha said, “Send for someone who can play the harp.” The harpist began playing, and the LORD gave Elisha this message for Joram:"
2 Kings,3,16,The LORD says that this dry river bed will be filled with water.
2 Kings,3,17,"You won't feel any wind or see any rain, but there will be plenty of water for you and your animals."
2 Kings,3,18,That simple thing isn't all the LORD is going to do. He will also help you defeat Moab's army.
2 Kings,3,19,"You will capture all their walled cities and important towns. You will chop down every good tree and stop up every spring of water, then ruin their fertile fields by covering them with rocks."
2 Kings,3,20,"The next morning, while the sacrifice was being offered, water suddenly started flowing from the direction of Edom, and it flooded the land."
2 Kings,3,21,"Meanwhile, the people of Moab had heard that the three kings were coming to attack them. They had called together all their fighting men, from the youngest to the oldest, and these troops were now standing at their border, ready for battle."
2 Kings,3,22,"When they got up that morning, the sun was shining across the water, making it look red. The Moabite troops took one look"
2 Kings,3,23,"and shouted, “Look at that blood! The armies of those kings must have fought and killed each other. Come on, let's go and take what's left in their camp.”"
2 Kings,3,24,"But when they arrived at Israel's camp, the Israelite soldiers came out and attacked them, until they turned and ran away. Israel's army chased them all the way back to Moab, and even there they kept up the attack."
2 Kings,3,25,"The Israelites destroyed the Moabite towns. They chopped down the good trees and stopped up the springs of water, then covered the fertile fields with rocks. Finally, the only city left standing was Kir-Hareseth, but soldiers armed with slings surrounded and attacked it."
2 Kings,3,26,King Mesha of Moab saw that he was about to be defeated. So he took along seven hundred soldiers with swords and tried to break through the front line where the Edomite troops were positioned. But he failed.
2 Kings,3,27,He then grabbed his eldest son who was to be the next king and sacrificed him as an offering on the city wall. The Israelite troops were so horrified that they left the city and went back home.
2 Kings,4,1,"One day the widow of one of the LORD 's prophets said to Elisha, “You know that before my husband died, he was a follower of yours and a worshipper of the LORD . But he owed a man some money, and now that man is on his way to take my two sons as his slaves.”"
2 Kings,4,2,"“Perhaps there's something I can do to help,” Elisha said. “What do you have in your house?” “Sir, I have nothing but a small bottle of olive oil.”"
2 Kings,4,3,"Elisha told her, “Ask your neighbours for their empty jars. And after you've borrowed as many as you can,"
2 Kings,4,4,go home and shut the door behind you and your sons. Then begin filling the jars with oil and set each one aside as you fill it.”
2 Kings,4,5,"The woman left. Later, when she and her sons were back inside their house, the two sons brought her the jars, and she began filling them."
2 Kings,4,6,"At last, she said to one of her sons, “Bring me another jar.” “We don't have any more,” he answered, and the oil stopped flowing from the small bottle."
2 Kings,4,7,"After she told Elisha what had happened, he said, “Sell the oil and use part of the money to pay what you owe the man. You and your sons can live on what is left.”"
2 Kings,4,8,"Once, while Elisha was in the town of Shunem, he met a rich woman who invited him to her home for dinner. After that, whenever he was in Shunem, he would have a meal there with her and her husband."
2 Kings,4,9,"Some time later the woman said to her husband, “I'm sure the man who comes here so often is a prophet of God."
2 Kings,4,10,"Why don't we build him a small room on the flat roof of our house? We can put a bed, a table and chair, and an oil lamp in it. Then whenever he comes, he can stay with us.”"
2 Kings,4,11,"The next time Elisha was in Shunem, he stopped at their house and went up to his room to rest."
2 Kings,5,1,"Naaman was the commander of the Syrian army. The LORD had helped him and his troops defeat their enemies, so the king of Syria respected Naaman very much. Naaman was a brave soldier, but he had leprosy."
2 Kings,5,2,"One day while the Syrian troops were raiding Israel, they captured a girl, and she became a servant of Naaman's wife."
2 Kings,5,3,"Some time later the girl said, “If your husband Naaman would go to the prophet in Samaria, he would be cured of his leprosy.”"
2 Kings,5,4,"When Naaman told the king what the girl had said,"
2 Kings,5,5,"the king replied, “Go ahead! I will give you a letter to take to the king of Israel.” Naaman left and took along thirty thousand pieces of silver, six thousand pieces of gold, and ten new outfits."
2 Kings,5,6,"He also carried the letter to the king of Israel. It said, “I am sending my servant Naaman to you. Would you cure him of his leprosy?”"
2 Kings,5,7,"When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes in fear and shouted, “That Syrian king believes I can cure this man of leprosy! Does he think I'm God with power over life and death? He must be trying to pick a fight with me.”"
2 Kings,5,8,"As soon as Elisha the prophet heard what had happened, he sent the Israelite king this message: “Why are you so afraid? Send the man to me, so that he will know there is a prophet in Israel.”"
2 Kings,5,9,Naaman left with his horses and chariots and stopped at the door of Elisha's house.
2 Kings,5,10,"Elisha sent someone outside to say to him, “Go and wash seven times in the River Jordan. Then you'll be completely cured.”"
2 Kings,5,11,"But Naaman stormed off, grumbling, “Why couldn't he come out and talk to me? I thought he would be sure to stand in front of me and pray to the LORD his God, then wave his hand over my skin and cure me."
2 Kings,5,12,What about the River Abana or the River Pharpar? Those rivers in Damascus are just as good as any river in Israel. I could have washed in them and been cured.”
2 Kings,5,13,"His servants went over to him and said, “Sir, if the prophet had told you to do something difficult, you would have done it. So why don't you do what he said? Go and wash and be cured.”"
2 Kings,5,14,"Naaman walked down to the Jordan; he waded out into the water and stooped down in it seven times, just as Elisha had told him. Straight away, he was cured, and his skin became as smooth as a child's."
2 Kings,5,15,"Naaman and his officials went back to Elisha. Naaman stood in front of him and announced, “Now I know that the God of Israel is the only God in the whole world. Sir, would you please accept a gift from me?”"
2 Kings,5,16,"“I am a servant of the living LORD ,” Elisha answered, “and I swear that I will not take anything from you.” Naaman kept begging, but Elisha kept refusing."
2 Kings,5,17,"Finally Naaman said, “If you won't accept a gift, then please let me take home as much soil as two mules can pull in a wagon. Sir, from now on I will offer sacrifices only to the LORD."
2 Kings,5,18,But I pray that the LORD will forgive me when I go into the temple of the god Rimmon and bow down there with the king of Syria.”
2 Kings,5,19,"“Go home, and don't worry about that,” Elisha replied. Then Naaman left. After Naaman had gone only a short distance,"
2 Kings,5,20,"Gehazi said to himself, “Elisha let that Syrian off too easily. He should have taken Naaman's gift. I swear by the living LORD that I will talk to Naaman myself and get something from him.”"
2 Kings,5,21,"So he hurried after Naaman. When Naaman saw Gehazi running after him, he got out of his chariot to meet him. Naaman asked, “Is everything all right?”"
2 Kings,5,22,"“Yes,” Gehazi answered. “But my master has sent me to tell you about two young prophets from the hills of Ephraim. They came asking for help, and now Elisha wants to know if you would give them three thousand pieces of silver and some new clothes?”"
2 Kings,5,23,"“Certainly,” Naaman replied. “But why don't you take twice that amount of silver?” He convinced Gehazi to take it all, then put the silver in two bags. He handed the bags and the clothes to his two servants, and they carried them for Gehazi."
2 Kings,5,24,"When they reached the hill where Gehazi lived, he took the bags from the servants and placed them in his house, then sent the men away. After they had gone,"
2 Kings,5,25,"Gehazi went in and stood in front of Elisha, who asked, “Gehazi, where have you been?” “Nowhere, sir,” Gehazi answered."
2 Kings,5,26,"Elisha asked, “Don't you know that my spirit was there when Naaman got out of his chariot to talk with you? Gehazi, you have no right to accept money or clothes, olive orchards or vineyards, sheep or cattle, or servants."
2 Kings,5,27,"Because of what you've done, Naaman's leprosy will now be on you and your descendants for ever!” Suddenly, Gehazi's skin became white with leprosy, and he left."
2 Kings,6,1,"One day the prophets said to Elisha, “The place where we meet with you is too small."
2 Kings,6,2,"Why don't we build a new meeting place near the River Jordan? Each of us could get some wood, then we could build it.” “That's a good idea,” Elisha replied, “get started.”"
2 Kings,6,3,"“Aren't you going with us?” one of the prophets asked. “Yes, I'll go,” Elisha answered,"
2 Kings,6,4,and he left with them. They went to the River Jordan and began chopping down trees.
2 Kings,6,5,"While one of the prophets was working, his axe head fell off and dropped into the water. “Oh!” he shouted. “Sir, I borrowed this axe.”"
2 Kings,6,6,"“Where did it fall in?” Elisha asked. The prophet pointed to the place, and Elisha cut a stick and threw it into the water at that spot. The axe head floated to the top of the water."
2 Kings,6,7,"“Now get it,” Elisha told him. And the prophet reached in and grabbed it."
2 Kings,6,8,"Time after time, when the king of Syria was at war against the Israelites, he met with his officers and announced, “I've decided where we will set up camp.”"
2 Kings,6,9,"Each time, Elisha would send this warning to the king of Israel: “Don't go near there. That's where the Syrian troops have set up camp.”"
2 Kings,6,10,So the king would warn the Israelite troops in that place to be on guard.
2 Kings,6,11,"The king of Syria was furious when he found out what was happening. He called in his officers and asked, “Which one of you has been telling the king of Israel our plans?”"
2 Kings,6,12,"“None of us, Your Majesty,” one of them answered. “It's an Israelite named Elisha. He's a prophet, so he can tell his king everything—even what you say in your own room.”"
2 Kings,6,13,“Find out where he is!” the king ordered. “I'll send soldiers to bring him here.” They learnt that Elisha was in the town of Dothan and reported it to the king.
2 Kings,6,14,He ordered his best troops to go there with horses and chariots. They marched out during the night and surrounded the town.
2 Kings,6,15,"When Elisha's servant got up the next morning, he saw that Syrian troops had the town surrounded. “Sir, what are we going to do?” he asked."
2 Kings,6,16,"“Don't be afraid,” Elisha answered. “There are more troops on our side than on theirs.”"
2 Kings,6,17,"Then he prayed, “ LORD , please help him to see.” And the LORD let the servant see that the hill was covered with fiery horses and flaming chariots all around Elisha."
2 Kings,6,18,"As the Syrian army came closer, Elisha prayed, “ LORD , make those soldiers blind!” And the LORD blinded them with a bright light."
2 Kings,6,19,"Elisha told the enemy troops, “You've taken the wrong road and are in the wrong town. Follow me. I'll lead you to the man you're looking for.” Elisha led them straight to the capital city of Samaria."
2 Kings,6,20,"When all the soldiers were inside the city, Elisha prayed, “ LORD , now let them see again.” The LORD let them see that they were standing in the middle of Samaria."
2 Kings,6,21,"The king of Israel saw them and asked Elisha, “Should I kill them, sir?”"
2 Kings,6,22,"“No!” Elisha answered. “You didn't capture these troops in battle, so you have no right to kill them. Instead, give them something to eat and drink and let them return to their leader.”"
2 Kings,6,23,"The king ordered a huge meal to be prepared for Syria's army, and when they finished eating, he let them go. For a while, the Syrian troops stopped invading Israel's territory."
2 Kings,6,24,"Some time later, King Benhadad of Syria called his entire army together, then they marched to Samaria and attacked."
2 Kings,6,25,"They kept up the attack until there was nothing to eat in the city. In fact, a donkey's head cost about eighty pieces of silver, and a small bowl of pigeon droppings cost five pieces of silver."
2 Kings,6,26,"One day as the king of Israel was walking along the top of the city wall, a woman shouted to him, “Please, Your Majesty, help me!”"
2 Kings,6,27,“Let the LORD help you!” the king said. “Do you think I have grain or wine to give you?”
2 Kings,6,28,"Then he asked, “What's the matter anyway?” The woman answered, “Another woman and I were so hungry that we agreed to eat our sons. She said if we ate my son one day, we could eat hers the next day."
2 Kings,6,29,"So yesterday we cooked my son and ate him. But today when I went to her house to eat her son, she had hidden him.”"
2 Kings,6,30,"The king tore off his clothes in sorrow, and since he was on top of the city wall, the people saw that he was wearing sackcloth underneath."
2 Kings,6,31,"He said, “I pray that God will punish me terribly, if Elisha's head is still on his shoulders by this time tomorrow.”"
2 Kings,6,32,"Then he sent a messenger to Elisha. Elisha was at home at the time, and the important leaders of Israel were meeting with him. Even before the king's messenger arrived, Elisha told the leaders, “That murderer is sending someone to cut off my head. When you see him coming, shut the door and don't let him in. I'm sure the king himself will be just behind him.”"
2 Kings,6,33,"Before Elisha finished talking, the messenger came up and said, “The LORD has made all these terrible things happen to us. Why should I think he will help us now?”"
2 Kings,7,1,"Elisha answered, “I have a message for you. The LORD promises that tomorrow here in Samaria, you will be able to buy a large sack of flour or two large sacks of barley for almost nothing.”"
2 Kings,7,2,"The chief officer there with the king replied, “I don't believe it! Even if the LORD sent a rainstorm, it couldn't produce that much grain by tomorrow.” “You will see it happen, but you won't eat any of the food,” Elisha warned him."
2 Kings,7,3,"About the same time, four men with leprosy were just outside the gate of Samaria. They said to each other, “Why should we sit here, waiting to die?"
2 Kings,7,4,"There's nothing to eat in the city, so we would starve if we went inside. But if we stay out here, we will die for certain. Let's sneak over to the Syrian army camp and surrender. They might kill us, but they might not.”"
2 Kings,8,1,"Elisha told the woman whose son he had brought back to life, “The LORD has warned that there will be no food here for seven years. Take your family and go and live somewhere else for a while.”"
2 Kings,8,2,The woman did exactly what Elisha had said and went to live in Philistine territory. She and her family lived there seven years.
2 Kings,8,3,Then she returned to Israel and immediately begged the king to give back her house and property.
2 Kings,8,4,"Meanwhile, the king was asking Gehazi the servant of Elisha about the amazing things Elisha had been doing."
2 Kings,8,5,"While Gehazi was telling him that Elisha had brought a dead boy back to life, the woman and her son arrived. “Here's the boy, Your Majesty,” Gehazi said. “And this is his mother.”"
2 Kings,8,6,"The king asked the woman to tell her story, and she told him everything that had happened. He then said to one of his officials, “I want you to make sure that this woman gets back everything that belonged to her, including the money her crops have made since the day she left Israel.”"
2 Kings,8,7,"Some time later Elisha went to the capital city of Damascus to visit King Benhadad of Syria, who was sick. And when Benhadad was told he was there,"
2 Kings,8,8,"he said to Hazael, “Go and see Elisha the man of God and get him to ask the LORD if I will get well. And take along a gift for him.”"
2 Kings,8,9,"Hazael left with forty camel loads of the best things made in Damascus as a gift for Elisha. He found the prophet and said, “Your servant, King Benhadad, wants to know if he will get well.”"
2 Kings,8,10,"“Tell him he will,” Elisha said to Hazael. “But the LORD has already told me that Benhadad will definitely die.”"
2 Kings,8,11,"Elisha stared at him until Hazael was embarrassed, then Elisha began crying."
2 Kings,8,12,"“Sir, why are you crying?” Hazael asked. Elisha answered, “Because I know the terrible things you will do to the people of Israel. You will burn down their walled cities and slaughter their young men. You will even crush the heads of their babies and rip open their pregnant women.”"
2 Kings,8,13,"“How could I ever do anything like that?” Hazael replied. “I'm only a servant and don't have that kind of power.” “Hazael, the LORD has told me that you will be the next king of Syria.”"
2 Kings,8,14,"Hazael went back to Benhadad and told him, “Elisha said that you will get well.”"
2 Kings,8,15,"But the very next day, Hazael got a thick blanket; he soaked it in water and held it over Benhadad's face until he died. Hazael then became king."
2 Kings,8,16,"Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat became king of Judah in Joram's fifth year as king of Israel, while Jehoshaphat was still king of Judah."
2 Kings,8,17,"Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he ruled eight years from Jerusalem."
2 Kings,8,18,Jehoram disobeyed the LORD by doing wrong. He married Ahab's daughter and was as sinful as Ahab's family and the kings of Israel.
2 Kings,8,19,"But the LORD refused to destroy Judah, because he had promised his servant David that someone from his family would always rule in Judah."
2 Kings,8,20,"While Jehoram was king, the people of Edom rebelled and chose their own king."
2 Kings,8,21,"So Jehoram and his cavalry marched to Zair, where the Edomite army surrounded him and his commanders. During the night he attacked the Edomites, but he was defeated, and his troops escaped to their homes."
2 Kings,8,22,Judah was never able to regain control of Edom. Even the town of Libnah rebelled at that time.
2 Kings,8,23,Everything else Jehoram did while he was king is written in The History of the Kings of Judah.
2 Kings,8,24,Jehoram died and was buried beside his ancestors in Jerusalem. His son Ahaziah then became king.
2 Kings,8,25,Ahaziah son of Jehoram became king of Judah in the twelfth year of Joram's rule in Israel.
2 Kings,8,26,"Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he ruled from Jerusalem for only one year. His mother was Athaliah, a granddaughter of King Omri of Israel."
2 Kings,8,27,"Since Ahaziah was related to Ahab's family, he acted just like them and disobeyed the LORD by doing wrong."
2 Kings,8,28,"Ahaziah went with King Joram of Israel to attack King Hazael and the Syrian troops at Ramoth in Gilead. Joram was wounded in that battle,"
2 Kings,8,29,so he went to the town of Jezreel to recover. Ahaziah went there to visit him.
2 Kings,9,1,"One day, Elisha called for one of the other prophets and said: Take this bottle of olive oil and get ready to go to the town of Ramoth in Gilead."
2 Kings,9,2,"When you get there, find Jehu son of Jehoshaphat and grandson of Nimshi. Take him to a place where the two of you can be alone,"
2 Kings,9,3,"then pour olive oil on his head to show that he is the new king. Say to him, “The LORD has chosen you to be king of Israel.” Then leave quickly—don't wait for anything!"
2 Kings,9,4,The young prophet left for Ramoth.
2 Kings,9,5,"When he arrived, the army officers were meeting together. “Sir, I have a message for you,” he said. “For which one of us?” Jehu asked. “You, sir,” the prophet answered."
2 Kings,9,6,"So Jehu got up and went inside. The prophet poured olive oil on Jehu's head and told him: The LORD God of Israel has this message for you: “I am the LORD , and I have chosen you to be king of my people Israel."
2 Kings,9,7,"I want you to wipe out the family of Ahab, so Jezebel will be punished for killing the prophets and my other servants."
2 Kings,9,8,"Every man and boy in Ahab's family must die, whether slave or free."
2 Kings,9,9,"His whole family must be destroyed, just like the families of Jeroboam son of Nebat and Baasha son of Ahijah."
2 Kings,9,10,"As for Jezebel, her body will be eaten by dogs in the town of Jezreel. There won't be enough left of her to bury.” Then the young prophet opened the door and ran out."
2 Kings,9,11,"Jehu went back to his officers, and one of them asked, “What did that mad prophet want? Is everything all right?” “You know him and how he talks,” Jehu answered."
2 Kings,9,12,"“No, we don't. What did he say?” they asked. “He had a message from the LORD ,” Jehu replied. “He said that the LORD has chosen me to be the next king of Israel.”"
2 Kings,9,13,"They quickly grabbed their coats and spread them out on the steps where Jehu was standing. Someone blew a trumpet, and everyone shouted, “Jehu is king!”"
2 Kings,10,1,"Ahab still had seventy descendants living in Samaria. So Jehu wrote a letter to each of the important leaders and officials of the town, and to those who supported Ahab. In the letters he wrote:"
2 Kings,10,2,"Your town is strong, and you're protected by chariots and an armed cavalry. And I know that King Ahab's descendants live there with you. So as soon as you read this letter,"
2 Kings,10,3,choose the best person for the job and make him the next king. Then be prepared to defend Ahab's family.
2 Kings,10,4,"The officials and leaders read the letters and were very frightened. They said to each other, “Jehu has already killed King Joram and King Ahaziah! We have to do what he says.”"
2 Kings,10,5,"The prime minister, the mayor of the city, as well as the other leaders and Ahab's supporters, sent this answer to Jehu, “We are your servants, Your Majesty, and we will do whatever you tell us. But it's not our place to choose someone to be king. You do what you think is best.”"
2 Kings,10,6,"Jehu then wrote another letter which said, “If you are on my side and will obey me, then prove it. Bring me the heads of the descendants of Ahab! And be here in Jezreel by this time tomorrow.” The seventy descendants of King Ahab were living with some of the most important people of the city."
2 Kings,10,7,"And when these people read Jehu's second letter, they called together all seventy of Ahab's descendants. They killed them, put their heads in baskets, and sent them to Jezreel."
2 Kings,10,8,"When Jehu was told what had happened, he said, “Put the heads in two piles at the city gate, and leave them there until morning.”"
2 Kings,10,9,"The next morning, Jehu went out and stood where everyone could hear him, and he said, “You people are not guilty of anything. I'm the one who plotted against Joram and had him killed. But who killed all these men?"
2 Kings,10,10,Listen to me. Everything the LORD 's servant Elijah promised about Ahab's family will come true.”
2 Kings,10,11,"Then Jehu killed the rest of Ahab's relatives living in Jezreel, as well as his highest officials, his priests, and his closest friends. No one in Ahab's family was left alive in Jezreel."
2 Kings,11,1,"As soon as Athaliah heard that her son King Ahaziah was dead, she decided to kill any relative who could possibly become king. She would have done that,"
2 Kings,11,2,"but Jehosheba rescued Joash son of Ahaziah just as he was about to be murdered. Jehosheba, who was Jehoram's daughter and Ahaziah's half-sister, hid her nephew Joash and his personal servant in a bedroom in the LORD 's temple where he was safe from Athaliah."
2 Kings,11,3,Joash hid in the temple with Jehosheba for six years while Athaliah ruled as queen of Judah.
2 Kings,11,4,"Joash son of Ahaziah had hidden in the LORD 's temple six years. Then in the seventh year, Jehoiada the priest sent for the commanders of the king's special bodyguards and the commanders of the palace guards. They met him at the temple, and he asked them to make a promise in the name of the LORD . Then he brought out Joash"
2 Kings,11,5,and said to them: Here's what I want you to do. Three of your guard units will be on duty on the Sabbath. I want one unit to guard the palace.
2 Kings,11,6,"Another unit will guard Sur Gate, and the third unit will guard the palace gate and relieve the palace guards."
2 Kings,11,7,The other two guard units are supposed to be off duty on the Sabbath. But I want both of them to stay here at the temple and protect King Joash.
2 Kings,11,8,"Make sure they follow him wherever he goes, and tell them to keep their swords ready to kill anyone who tries to get near him."
2 Kings,11,9,The commanders followed Jehoiada's orders. Each one called together his guards—those coming on duty and those going off duty.
2 Kings,11,10,Jehoiada brought out the swords and shields that had belonged to King David and gave them to the commanders.
2 Kings,11,11,"Then they gave the weapons to their guards, who took their positions around the temple and the altar to protect Joash on every side."
2 Kings,11,12,"Jehoiada brought Joash outside, where he placed the crown on his head and gave him a copy of instructions for ruling the nation. Olive oil was poured on his head to show that he was now king, while the crowd clapped and shouted, “Long live the king!”"
2 Kings,11,13,Queen Athaliah heard the crowd and went to the temple.
2 Kings,11,14,"There she saw Joash standing by one of the columns, which was the usual place for the king. The singers and the trumpet players were standing next to him, and the people were celebrating and blowing trumpets. Athaliah tore her clothes in anger and shouted, “You betrayed me, you traitors!”"
2 Kings,11,15,"Straight away, Jehoiada said to the army commanders, “Kill her! But don't do it anywhere near the LORD 's temple. Take her out in front of the troops and kill anyone who is with her!”"
2 Kings,11,16,"So the commanders dragged her to the gate where horses are led into the palace, and they killed her there."
2 Kings,11,17,Jehoiada the priest asked King Joash and the people to promise that they would be faithful to each other and to the LORD.
2 Kings,11,18,"Then the crowd went to the temple built to honour Baal and tore it down. They smashed the altars and idols and killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars. After Jehoiada had placed guards around the LORD 's temple,"
2 Kings,11,19,"he called together all the commanders, the king's special bodyguards, the palace guards, and the people. They led Joash from the temple, through the Guards' Gate, and into the palace. He took his place on the throne and became king of Judah."
2 Kings,11,20,Everyone celebrated because Athaliah had been killed and Jerusalem was peaceful again.
2 Kings,11,21,Joash was only seven years old when this happened.
2 Kings,12,1,"Joash became king of Judah in Jehu's seventh year as king of Israel, and he ruled forty years from Jerusalem. His mother Zibiah was from the town of Beersheba."
2 Kings,12,2,"Jehoiada the priest taught Joash what was right, and so for the rest of his life Joash obeyed the LORD."
2 Kings,12,3,"But even Joash did not destroy the local shrines, and they were still used as places for offering sacrifices."
2 Kings,12,4,"One day, Joash said to the priests, “Collect all the money that has been given to the LORD 's temple, whether from taxes or gifts,"
2 Kings,12,5,and use it to repair the temple. You priests can contribute your own money too.”
2 Kings,12,6,"But the priests never started repairing the temple. So in the twenty-third year of his rule,"
2 Kings,12,7,"Joash called for Jehoiada and the other priests and said, “Why aren't you using the money to repair the temple? Don't take any more money for yourselves. It is only to be used to pay for the repairs.”"
2 Kings,12,8,The priests agreed that they would not collect any more money or be in charge of the temple repairs.
2 Kings,12,9,"Jehoiada found a wooden box; he cut a hole in the top of it and set it on the right side of the altar where people went into the temple. Whenever someone gave money to the temple, the priests guarding the entrance would put it into this box."
2 Kings,12,10,"When the box was full of money, the king's secretary and the chief priest would count the money and put it in bags."
2 Kings,12,11,"Then they would give it to the men supervising the repairs to the temple. Some of the money was used to pay the builders, the woodworkers,"
2 Kings,12,12,"the stonecutters, and the men who built the walls. And some was used to buy wood and stone and to pay any other costs for repairing the temple."
2 Kings,12,13,"While the repairs were being made, the money that was given to the temple was not used to make silver bowls, lamp snuffers, small sprinkling bowls, trumpets, or anything gold or silver for the temple."
2 Kings,12,14,It went only to pay for repairs.
2 Kings,12,15,"The men in charge were honest, so no one had to keep track of the money."
2 Kings,12,16,The fines that had to be paid along with the sacrifices to make things right and the sacrifices for sin did not go to the temple. This money belonged only to the priests.
2 Kings,12,17,"About the same time, King Hazael of Syria attacked the town of Gath and captured it. Next, he decided to attack Jerusalem."
2 Kings,12,18,"So Joash collected everything he and his ancestors Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, and Ahaziah had dedicated to the LORD , as well as the gold in the storage rooms in the temple and palace. He sent it all to Hazael as a gift, and when Hazael received it, he ordered his troops to leave Jerusalem."
2 Kings,12,19,Everything else Joash did while he was king is written in The History of the Kings of Judah.
2 Kings,13,1,Jehoahaz son of Jehu became king of Israel in the twenty-third year of Joash's rule in Judah. Jehoahaz ruled seventeen years from Samaria
2 Kings,13,2,"and disobeyed the LORD by doing wrong. He never stopped following the example of Jeroboam, who had caused the Israelites to sin."
2 Kings,13,3,"The LORD was angry with the Israelites, so he let King Hazael of Syria and his son Benhadad rule over them for a long time."
2 Kings,13,4,"Jehoahaz prayed to the LORD for help, and the LORD saw how terribly Hazael was treating the Israelites. He answered Jehoahaz"
2 Kings,13,5,"by sending Israel a leader who rescued them from the Syrians, and the Israelites lived in peace as they had before."
2 Kings,14,1,Amaziah son of Joash became king of Judah in the second year of Jehoash's rule in Israel.
2 Kings,14,2,"Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he ruled twenty-nine years from Jerusalem, which was also the home town of his mother Jehoaddin."
2 Kings,14,3,Amaziah followed the example of his father Joash by obeying the LORD and doing right. But he was not as faithful as his ancestor David.
2 Kings,14,4,"Amaziah did not destroy the local shrines, and they were still used as places for offering sacrifices."
2 Kings,14,5,"As soon as Amaziah had control of Judah, he arrested and killed the officers who had murdered his father."
2 Kings,14,6,"But the children of those officers were not killed. The LORD had commanded in the Law of Moses that only the people who sinned were to be punished, not their parents or children."
2 Kings,14,7,"While Amaziah was king, he killed ten thousand Edomite soldiers in Salt Valley. He captured the town of Sela and renamed it Joktheel, which is still its name."
2 Kings,14,8,"One day, Amaziah sent a message to King Jehoash of Israel: “Come out and face me in battle!”"
2 Kings,14,9,"Jehoash sent back this reply: Once upon a time, a small thorn bush in Lebanon announced that his son was going to marry the daughter of a large cedar tree. But a wild animal came along and trampled the small bush."
2 Kings,14,10,"Amaziah, you think you're so powerful because you defeated Edom. Go ahead and celebrate—but stay at home. If you cause any trouble, both you and your kingdom of Judah will be destroyed."
2 Kings,14,11,But Amaziah refused to listen. So Jehoash and his troops marched to the town of Beth-Shemesh in Judah to attack Amaziah and his troops.
2 Kings,14,12,"During the battle, Judah's army was crushed. Every soldier from Judah ran back home,"
2 Kings,14,13,"and Jehoash captured Amaziah. Jehoash then marched to Jerusalem and broke down the city wall from Ephraim Gate to Corner Gate, a section nearly two hundred metres long."
2 Kings,14,14,"He took the gold and silver, as well as everything of value from the LORD 's temple and the king's treasury. He took hostages, then returned to Samaria."
2 Kings,14,15,"Everything else Jehoash did while he was king, including his brave deeds and how he defeated King Amaziah of Judah, is written in The History of the Kings of Israel."
2 Kings,14,16,Jehoash died and was buried in Samaria beside the other Israelite kings. His son Jeroboam then became king.
2 Kings,14,17,"Fifteen years after Jehoash died,"
2 Kings,15,1,Azariah son of Amaziah became king of Judah in Jeroboam's twenty-seventh year as king of Israel.
2 Kings,15,2,"He was only sixteen years old when he became king, and he ruled fifty-two years from Jerusalem, which was also the home town of his mother Jecoliah."
2 Kings,15,3,"Azariah obeyed the LORD by doing right, as his father Amaziah had done."
2 Kings,15,4,"But Azariah did not destroy the local shrines, and they were still used as places for offering sacrifices."
2 Kings,15,5,"The LORD punished Azariah with leprosy for the rest of his life. He wasn't allowed to live in the royal palace, so his son Jotham lived there and ruled in his place."
2 Kings,15,6,Everything else Azariah did while he was king is written in The History of the Kings of Judah.
2 Kings,15,7,Azariah died and was buried beside his ancestors in Jerusalem. His son Jotham then became king.
2 Kings,15,8,"Zechariah son of Jeroboam became king of Israel in the thirty-eighth year of Azariah's rule in Judah, but he ruled only six months from Samaria."
2 Kings,15,9,"Like his ancestors, Zechariah disobeyed the LORD by following the evil ways of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who had caused the Israelites to sin."
2 Kings,15,10,Shallum son of Jabesh plotted against Zechariah and killed him in public. Shallum then became king.
2 Kings,16,1,Ahaz son of Jotham became king of Judah in the seventeenth year of Pekah's rule in Israel.
2 Kings,16,2,"He was twenty years old at the time, and he ruled from Jerusalem for sixteen years. Ahaz wasn't like his ancestor David. Instead, he disobeyed the LORD"
2 Kings,16,3,"and was even more sinful than the kings of Israel. He sacrificed his own son, which was a disgusting custom of the nations that the LORD had forced out of Israel."
2 Kings,16,4,"Ahaz offered sacrifices at the local shrines, as well as on every hill and in the shade of large trees."
2 Kings,17,1,"Hoshea son of Elah became king of Israel in the twelfth year of Ahaz's rule in Judah, and he ruled nine years from Samaria."
2 Kings,17,2,"Hoshea disobeyed the LORD and sinned, but not as much as the earlier Israelite kings had done."
2 Kings,17,3,"During Hoshea's rule, King Shalmaneser of Assyria invaded Israel; he took control of the country and made Hoshea pay taxes."
2 Kings,17,4,"But later, Hoshea refused to pay the taxes and asked King So of Egypt to help him rebel. When Shalmaneser found out, he arrested Hoshea and put him in prison."
2 Kings,17,5,"Shalmaneser invaded Israel and attacked the city of Samaria for three years,"
2 Kings,17,6,"before capturing it in the ninth year of Hoshea's rule. The Assyrian king took the Israelites away to Assyria as prisoners. He forced some of them to live in the town of Halah, others to live near the River Habor in the territory of Gozan, and still others to live in towns where the Median people lived."
2 Kings,17,7,"All of this happened because the people of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God, who had rescued them from Egypt, where they had been slaves. They worshipped foreign gods,"
2 Kings,17,8,"followed the customs of the nations that the LORD had forced out of Israel, and were just as sinful as the Israelite kings."
2 Kings,17,9,"Even worse, the Israelites tried to hide their sins from the LORD their God. They built their own local shrines everywhere in Israel—from small towns to large, walled cities."
2 Kings,17,10,They also built stone images of foreign gods and set up sacred poles for the worship of Asherah on every hill and under every shady tree.
2 Kings,17,11,"They offered sacrifices at the shrines, just as the foreign nations had done before the LORD forced them out of Israel. They did sinful things that made the LORD very angry."
2 Kings,17,12,"Even though the LORD had commanded the Israelites not to worship idols, they did it anyway."
2 Kings,17,13,"So the LORD made sure that every prophet warned Israel and Judah with these words: “I, the LORD , command you to stop doing sinful things and start obeying my laws and teachings! I gave them to your ancestors, and I told my servants the prophets to repeat them to you.”"
2 Kings,17,14,But the Israelites would not listen; they were as stubborn as their ancestors who had refused to worship the LORD their God.
2 Kings,17,15,"They ignored the LORD 's warnings and commands, and they rejected the solemn agreement he had made with their ancestors. They worshipped worthless idols and became worthless themselves. The LORD had told the Israelites not to do the things that the foreign nations around them were doing, but Israel became just like them."
2 Kings,17,16,The people of Israel disobeyed all the commands of the LORD their God. They made two gold statues of calves and set up a sacred pole for Asherah; they also worshipped the stars and the god Baal.
2 Kings,17,17,They used magic and witchcraft and even sacrificed their own children. The Israelites were determined to do whatever the LORD hated.
2 Kings,17,18,"The LORD became so furious with the people of Israel that he allowed them to be carried away as prisoners. Only the people living in Judah were left,"
2 Kings,17,19,but they also disobeyed the LORD 's commands and acted like the Israelites.
2 Kings,17,20,So the LORD turned his back on everyone in Israel and Judah and let them be punished and defeated until no one was left.
2 Kings,17,21,"Earlier, when the LORD took the northern tribes away from David's family, the people living in northern Israel chose Jeroboam son of Nebat as their king. Jeroboam caused the Israelites to sin and to stop worshipping the LORD."
2 Kings,17,22,"The people kept on sinning like Jeroboam,"
2 Kings,17,23,"until the LORD got rid of them, just as he had warned his servants the prophets. That's why the people of Israel were taken away as prisoners to Assyria, and that's where they remained."
2 Kings,17,24,"The king of Assyria took people who were living in the cities of Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim, and forced them to move to Israel. They took over the towns where the Israelites had lived, including the capital city of Samaria."
2 Kings,17,25,"At first these people did not worship the LORD , so he sent lions to attack them, and the lions killed some of them."
2 Kings,17,26,"A messenger told the king of Assyria, “The people you moved to Israel don't know how to worship the god of that country. So he sent lions that have attacked and killed some of them.”"
2 Kings,17,27,"The king replied, “Get one of the Israelite priests we brought here and send him back to Israel. He can live there and teach them about the god of that country.”"
2 Kings,17,28,One of the Israelite priests was chosen to go back to Israel. He lived in Bethel and taught the people how to worship the LORD.
2 Kings,17,29,"But in towns all over Israel, the different groups of people made statues of their own gods, then they placed these idols in local Israelite shrines."
2 Kings,17,30,The people from Babylonia made the god Succoth-Benoth; those from Cuthah made the god Nergal; those from Hamath made Ashima;
2 Kings,17,31,those from Avva made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the people from Sepharvaim sacrificed their children to their own gods Adrammelech and Anammelech.
2 Kings,18,1,Hezekiah son of Ahaz became king of Judah in the third year of Hoshea's rule in Israel.
2 Kings,18,2,"Hezekiah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he ruled twenty-nine years from Jerusalem. His mother Abi was the daughter of Zechariah."
2 Kings,18,3,"Hezekiah obeyed the LORD , just as his ancestor David had done."
2 Kings,18,4,"He destroyed the local shrines, then tore down the images of foreign gods and cut down the sacred pole for worshipping the goddess Asherah. He also smashed the bronze snake Moses had made. The people had named it Nehushtan and had been offering sacrifices to it."
2 Kings,18,5,"Hezekiah trusted the LORD God of Israel. No other king of Judah was like Hezekiah, either before or after him."
2 Kings,18,6,He was completely faithful to the LORD and obeyed the laws the LORD had given to Moses for the people.
2 Kings,18,7,"The LORD helped Hezekiah, so he was successful in everything he did. He even rebelled against the king of Assyria, refusing to be his servant."
2 Kings,18,8,"Hezekiah defeated the Philistine towns as far away as Gaza—from the smallest towns to the large, walled cities."
2 Kings,18,9,"During the fourth year of Hezekiah's rule, which was the seventh year of Hoshea's rule in Israel, King Shalmaneser of Assyria led his troops to Samaria, the capital city of Israel. They attacked"
2 Kings,18,10,"and captured it three years later, in the sixth year of Hezekiah's rule and the ninth year of Hoshea's rule."
2 Kings,18,11,"The king of Assyria took the Israelites away as prisoners; he forced some of them to live in the town of Halah, others to live near the River Habor in the territory of Gozan, and still others to live in towns where the Median people lived."
2 Kings,18,12,"All of that happened because the people of Israel had not obeyed the LORD their God. They rejected the solemn agreement he had made with them, and they ignored everything that the LORD 's servant Moses had told them."
2 Kings,18,13,"In the fourteenth year of Hezekiah's rule in Judah, King Sennacherib of Assyria invaded the country and captured every walled city, except Jerusalem."
2 Kings,18,14,"Hezekiah sent this message to Sennacherib, who was in the town of Lachish: “I know I am guilty of rebellion. But I will pay you whatever you want, if you stop your attack.” Sennacherib told Hezekiah to pay ten thousand kilogrammes of silver and a thousand kilogrammes of gold."
2 Kings,18,15,So Hezekiah collected all the silver from the LORD 's temple and the royal treasury.
2 Kings,18,16,He even stripped the gold that he had used to cover the doors and doorposts in the temple. He gave it all to Sennacherib.
2 Kings,18,17,"The king of Assyria ordered his three highest military officers to leave Lachish and take a large army to Jerusalem. When they arrived, the officers stood on the road near the cloth makers' shops along the canal from the upper pool."
2 Kings,18,18,"They called out to Hezekiah, and three of his highest officials came out to meet them. One of them was Hilkiah's son Eliakim, who was the prime minister. The other two were Shebna, assistant to the prime minister, and Joah son of Asaph, keeper of the government records."
2 Kings,18,19,One of the Assyrian commanders told them: I have a message for Hezekiah from the great king of Assyria. Ask Hezekiah why he feels so sure of himself.
2 Kings,18,20,"Does he think he can plan and win a war with nothing but words? Who is going to help him, now that he has turned against the king of Assyria?"
2 Kings,18,21,"Is he depending on Egypt and its king? That's the same as leaning on a broken stick, and it will go right through his hand."
2 Kings,18,22,Is Hezekiah now depending on the LORD your God? Didn't Hezekiah tear down all except one of the LORD 's altars and places of worship? Didn't he tell the people of Jerusalem and Judah to worship at that one place?
2 Kings,18,23,"The king of Assyria wants to make a bet with you people. He will give you two thousand horses, if you have enough troops to ride them."
2 Kings,18,24,"How could you even defeat our lowest ranking officer, when you have to depend on Egypt for chariots and cavalry?"
2 Kings,18,25,Don't forget that it was the LORD who sent me here with orders to destroy your nation!
2 Kings,18,26,"Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said, “Sir, we don't want the people listening from the city wall to understand what you are saying. So please speak to us in Aramaic instead of Hebrew.”"
2 Kings,18,27,"The Assyrian army commander answered, “My king sent me to speak to everyone, not just to you leaders. These people will soon have to eat their own body waste and drink their own urine! And so will the three of you.”"
2 Kings,18,28,"Then, in a voice loud enough for everyone to hear, he shouted in Hebrew: Listen to what the great king of Assyria says!"
2 Kings,18,29,Don't be fooled by Hezekiah. He can't save you.
2 Kings,18,30,Don't trust him when he tells you that the LORD will protect you from the king of Assyria.
2 Kings,18,31,"Stop listening to Hezekiah! Pay attention to my king. Surrender to him. He will let you keep your own vineyards, fig trees, and cisterns"
2 Kings,18,32,"for a while. Then he will come and take you away to a country just like yours, where you can plant vineyards, raise your own grain, and have plenty of olive oil and honey. Believe me, you won't starve there. Hezekiah claims the LORD will save you. But don't be fooled by him."
2 Kings,18,33,Were any other gods able to defend their land against the king of Assyria?
2 Kings,18,34,"What happened to the gods of Hamath and Arpad? What about the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah? Were the gods of Samaria able to protect their land against the Assyrian forces?"
2 Kings,18,35,None of these gods kept their people safe from the king of Assyria. Do you think the LORD your God can do any better?
2 Kings,19,1,"As soon as Hezekiah heard the news, he tore off his clothes in sorrow and put on sackcloth. Then he went into the temple of the LORD."
2 Kings,19,2,"He told Prime Minister Eliakim, Assistant Prime Minister Shebna, and the senior priests to dress in sackcloth and tell the prophet Isaiah:"
2 Kings,19,3,"These are difficult and disgraceful times. Our nation is like a woman too weak to give birth, when it's time for her baby to be born."
2 Kings,19,4,"Please pray for those of us who are left alive. The king of Assyria sent his army commander to insult the living God. Perhaps the LORD heard what he said and will do something, if you will pray."
2 Kings,19,5,"When these leaders went to Isaiah,"
2 Kings,19,6,he told them that the LORD had this message for Hezekiah: I am the LORD . Don't worry about the insulting things that have been said about me by these messengers from the king of Assyria.
2 Kings,19,7,"I will upset him with rumours about what's happening in his own country. He will go back, and there I will make him die a violent death."
2 Kings,19,8,"Meanwhile, the commander of the Assyrian forces heard that his king had left the town of Lachish and was now attacking Libnah. So he went there."
2 Kings,19,9,About this same time the king of Assyria learnt that King Tirhakah of Ethiopia was on his way to attack him. Then the king of Assyria sent some messengers with this note for Hezekiah:
2 Kings,19,10,Don't trust your God or be fooled by his promise to defend Jerusalem against me.
2 Kings,19,11,You have heard how we Assyrian kings have completely wiped out other nations. What makes you feel so safe?
2 Kings,19,12,"The Assyrian kings before me destroyed the towns of Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and everyone from Eden who lived in Telassar. What good did their gods do them?"
2 Kings,19,13,"The kings of Hamath, Arpad, Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah have all disappeared."
2 Kings,19,14,"After Hezekiah had read the note from the king of Assyria, he took it to the temple and spread it out for the LORD to see."
2 Kings,19,15,"He prayed: LORD God of Israel, your throne is above the winged creatures. You created the heavens and the earth, and you alone rule the kingdoms of this world."
2 Kings,19,16,"But just look how Sennacherib has insulted you, the living God."
2 Kings,19,17,"It is true, our LORD , that Assyrian kings have turned nations into deserts."
2 Kings,19,18,They destroyed the idols of wood and stone that the people of those nations had made and worshipped.
2 Kings,19,19,But you are our LORD and our God! We ask you to keep us safe from the Assyrian king. Then everyone in every kingdom on earth will know that you are the only God.
2 Kings,19,20,"Isaiah went to Hezekiah and told him that the LORD God of Israel had said: Hezekiah, I heard your prayer about King Sennacherib of Assyria."
2 Kings,19,21,Now this is what I say to that king: The people of Jerusalem hate and make fun of you; they laugh behind your back.
2 Kings,19,22,"Sennacherib, you cursed, shouted, and sneered at me, the holy God of Israel."
2 Kings,19,23,"You let your officials insult me, the Lord. And here is what you have said about yourself, “I led my chariots to the highest heights of Lebanon's mountains. I went deep into its forest, cutting down the best cedar and cypress trees."
2 Kings,19,24,"I dried up every stream in the land of Egypt, and I drank water from wells I had dug.”"
2 Kings,19,25,"Sennacherib, now listen to me, the Lord. I planned all this long ago. And you don't even realize that I alone am the one who decided that you would do these things. I let you make ruins of fortified cities."
2 Kings,19,26,"Their people became weak, terribly confused. They were like wild flowers or tender young grass growing on a flat roof, scorched before it matures."
2 Kings,19,27,"I know-all about you, even how fiercely angry you are with me."
2 Kings,19,28,"I have seen your pride and the tremendous hatred you have for me. Now I will put a hook in your nose, a bit in your mouth, then I will send you back to where you came from."
2 Kings,19,29,"Hezekiah, I will tell you what's going to happen. This year you will eat crops that grow on their own, and the next year you will eat whatever springs up where those crops grew. But the third year you will plant grain and vineyards, and you will eat what you harvest."
2 Kings,19,30,Those who survive in Judah will be like a vine that puts down deep roots and bears fruit.
2 Kings,19,31,"I, the LORD All-Powerful, will see to it that some who live in Jerusalem will survive."
2 Kings,19,32,"I promise that the king of Assyria won't get into Jerusalem, or shoot an arrow into the city, or even surround it and prepare to attack."
2 Kings,19,33,"As surely as I am the LORD , he will return by the way he came and will never enter Jerusalem."
2 Kings,19,34,I will protect it for myself and for my servant David.
2 Kings,19,35,"That same night the LORD sent an angel to the camp of the Assyrians, and he killed one hundred and eighty-five thousand of them. And so the next morning, the camp was full of dead bodies."
2 Kings,19,36,After this King Sennacherib went back to Assyria and lived in the city of Nineveh.
2 Kings,19,37,"One day he was worshipping in the temple of his god Nisroch, when his sons, Adrammelech and Sharezer, killed him with their swords. They escaped to the land of Ararat, and his son Esarhaddon became king."
2 Kings,20,1,"About this time, Hezekiah got sick and was almost dead. Isaiah the prophet went in and told him, “The LORD says you won't ever get well. You are going to die, so you had better start doing what needs to be done.”"
2 Kings,20,2,"Hezekiah turned towards the wall and prayed,"
2 Kings,20,3,"“Don't forget that I have been faithful to you, LORD . I have obeyed you with all my heart, and I do whatever you say is right.” After this, he cried hard."
2 Kings,20,4,"Before Isaiah got to the middle court of the palace,"
2 Kings,20,5,"the LORD sent him back to Hezekiah with this message: Hezekiah, you are the ruler of my people, and I am the LORD God, who was worshipped by your ancestor David. I heard you pray, and I saw you cry. I will heal you, so that three days from now you will be able to worship in my temple."
2 Kings,20,6,"I will let you live fifteen years more, while I protect you and your city from the king of Assyria. I will defend this city as an honour to me and to my servant David."
2 Kings,20,7,"Then Isaiah said to the king's servants, “Bring some mashed figs and place them on the king's open sore. He will then get well.”"
2 Kings,20,8,"Hezekiah asked Isaiah, “Can you prove that the LORD will heal me, so that I can worship in his temple in three days?”"
2 Kings,20,9,"Isaiah replied, “The LORD will prove to you that he will keep his promise. Will the shadow made by the setting sun on the stairway go forward ten steps or back ten steps?”"
2 Kings,20,10,"“It's normal for the sun to go forward,” Hezekiah answered. “But how can it go back?”"
2 Kings,20,11,"Isaiah prayed, and the LORD made the shadow go back ten steps on the stairway built for King Ahaz."
2 Kings,20,12,"Merodach Baladan, the son of Baladan, was now king of Babylonia. And when he learnt that Hezekiah had been sick, he sent messengers with letters and a gift for him."
2 Kings,20,13,"Hezekiah welcomed the messengers and showed them all the silver, the gold, the spices, and the fine oils that were in his storehouse. He even showed them where he kept his weapons. Nothing in his palace or in his entire kingdom was kept hidden from them."
2 Kings,20,14,"Isaiah asked Hezekiah, “Where did these men come from? What did they want?” “They came all the way from Babylonia,” Hezekiah answered."
2 Kings,20,15,"“What did you show them?” Isaiah asked. Hezekiah answered, “I showed them everything in my kingdom.”"
2 Kings,20,16,Then Isaiah told Hezekiah: I have a message for you from the LORD.
2 Kings,20,17,One day everything you and your ancestors have stored up will be taken to Babylonia. The LORD has promised that nothing will be left.
2 Kings,20,18,"Some of your own sons will be taken to Babylonia, where they will be disgraced and made to serve in the king's palace."
2 Kings,20,19,"Hezekiah thought, “At least our nation will be at peace for a while.” So he told Isaiah, “The message you brought me from the LORD is good.”"
2 Kings,20,20,"Everything else Hezekiah did while he was king, including how he made the upper pool and tunnel to bring water into Jerusalem, is written in The History of the Kings of Judah."
2 Kings,20,21,"Hezekiah died, and his son Manasseh became king."
2 Kings,21,1,"Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled fifty-five years from Jerusalem. His mother was Hephzibah."
2 Kings,21,2,Manasseh disobeyed the LORD by following the disgusting customs of the nations that the LORD had forced out of Israel.
2 Kings,21,3,"He rebuilt the local shrines that his father Hezekiah had torn down. He built altars for the god Baal and set up a sacred pole for worshipping the goddess Asherah, just as King Ahab of Israel had done. And he faithfully worshipped the stars in heaven."
2 Kings,21,4,"In the temple, where only the LORD was supposed to be worshipped, Manasseh built altars for pagan gods"
2 Kings,21,5,"and for the stars. He placed these altars in both courts of the temple,"
2 Kings,22,1,"Josiah was eight years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled thirty-one years from Jerusalem. His mother Jedidah was the daughter of Adaiah from Bozkath."
2 Kings,22,2,"Josiah always obeyed the LORD , just as his ancestor David had done."
2 Kings,22,3,"After Josiah had been king for eighteen years, he told Shaphan, one of his highest officials: Go to the LORD 's temple"
2 Kings,22,4,and ask Hilkiah the high priest to collect from the guards all the money that the people have donated.
2 Kings,22,5,Tell Hilkiah to give it to the men supervising the repairs to the temple. They can use some of the money to pay
2 Kings,22,6,"the workers, and with the rest of it they can buy wood and stone for the repair work."
2 Kings,22,7,"They are honest, so we won't ask them to keep track of the money."
2 Kings,22,8,"While Shaphan was at the temple, Hilkiah handed him a book and said, “Look what I found here in the temple— The Book of God's Law .” Shaphan read it,"
2 Kings,22,9,"then went back to Josiah and reported, “Your officials collected the money in the temple and gave it to the men supervising the repairs."
2 Kings,22,10,"But there's something else, Your Majesty. The priest Hilkiah gave me this book.” Then Shaphan read it out loud."
2 Kings,22,11,"When Josiah heard what was in The Book of God's Law , he tore his clothes in sorrow."
2 Kings,22,12,"At once he called together Hilkiah, Shaphan, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Achbor son of Micaiah, and his own servant Asaiah. He said,"
2 Kings,22,13,"“The LORD must be furious with me and everyone else in Judah, because our ancestors did not obey the laws written in this book. Go and find out what the LORD wants us to do.”"
2 Kings,22,14,"The five men left straight away and went to talk with Huldah the prophet. Her husband was Shallum, who was in charge of the king's clothes. Huldah lived in the northern part of Jerusalem, and when they met in her home,"
2 Kings,22,15,"she said: You were sent here by King Josiah, and this is what the LORD God of Israel says to him:"
2 Kings,22,16,"“Josiah, I am the LORD ! And I will see to it that this country and everyone living in it will be destroyed. It will happen just as this book says."
2 Kings,22,17,The people of Judah have rejected me. They have offered sacrifices to foreign gods and have worshipped their own idols. I cannot stand it any longer. I am furious.
2 Kings,22,18,"“Josiah, listen to what I am going to do."
2 Kings,22,19,"I noticed how sad you were when you read that this country and its people would be completely wiped out. You even tore your clothes in sorrow, and I heard you cry."
2 Kings,22,20,"So I will let you die in peace, before I destroy this place.” The men left and took Huldah's answer back to Josiah."
2 Kings,23,1,King Josiah called together the older leaders of Judah and Jerusalem.
2 Kings,23,2,"Then he went to the LORD 's temple, together with the people of Judah and Jerusalem, the priests, and the prophets. Finally, when everybody was there, he read aloud The Book of God's Law that had been found in the temple."
2 Kings,23,3,"After Josiah had finished reading, he stood by one of the columns. He asked the people to promise in the LORD 's name to obey the LORD faithfully and to follow his commands. The people agreed to do everything written in the book."
2 Kings,23,4,"Josiah told Hilkiah the priest, the assistant priests, and the guards at the temple door to go into the temple and bring out the things used to worship Baal, Asherah, and the stars. Josiah had these things burnt in Kidron Valley just outside Jerusalem, and he had the ashes carried away to the town of Bethel."
2 Kings,23,5,"Josiah also got rid of the pagan priests at the local shrines in Judah and around Jerusalem. These were the men whom the kings of Judah had appointed to offer sacrifices to Baal and to the sun, moon, and stars."
2 Kings,23,6,"Josiah had the sacred pole for Asherah brought out of the temple and taken to Kidron Valley, where it was burnt. He then had its ashes ground into dust and scattered over the public cemetery there."
2 Kings,23,7,"He had the buildings torn down where the male prostitutes lived next to the temple, and where the women wove sacred robes for the idol of Asherah."
2 Kings,23,8,"In almost every town in Judah, priests had been offering sacrifices to the LORD at local shrines. Josiah brought these priests to Jerusalem and had their shrines made unfit for worship—every shrine from Geba just north of Jerusalem to Beersheba in the south. He even tore down the shrine at Beersheba that was just to the left of Joshua Gate, which was named after the highest official of the city."
2 Kings,23,9,"Those local priests could not serve at the LORD 's altar in Jerusalem, but they were allowed to eat sacred bread, just like the priests from Jerusalem."
2 Kings,23,10,"Josiah sent some men to Hinnom Valley just outside Jerusalem with orders to make the altar there unfit for worship. That way, people could no longer use it for sacrificing their children to the god Molech."
2 Kings,23,11,"He also got rid of the horses that the kings of Judah used in their ceremonies to worship the sun, and he destroyed the chariots along with them. The horses had been kept near the entrance to the LORD 's temple, in a courtyard close to where an official named Nathan-Melech lived."
2 Kings,23,12,"Some of the kings of Judah, especially Manasseh, had built altars in the two courts of the temple and in the room that Ahaz had built on the palace roof. Josiah had these altars torn down and smashed to pieces, and he had the pieces thrown into Kidron Valley, just outside Jerusalem."
2 Kings,23,13,"After that, he closed down the shrines that Solomon had built east of Jerusalem and south of Spoil Hill to honour Astarte the disgusting goddess of Sidon, Chemosh the disgusting god of Moab, and Milcom the disgusting god of Ammon."
2 Kings,23,14,He tore down the stone images of foreign gods and cut down the sacred pole used in the worship of Asherah. Then he had the whole area covered with human bones.
2 Kings,23,15,But Josiah had not finished yet. At Bethel he destroyed the shrine and the altar that Jeroboam son of Nebat had built and that had caused the Israelites to sin. Josiah had the shrine and the Asherah pole burnt and ground into dust.
2 Kings,23,16,"As he looked around, he saw graves on the hillside. He had the bones in them dug up and burnt on the altar, so that it could no longer be used. This happened just as God's prophet had said when Jeroboam was standing at the altar, celebrating a festival. Then Josiah saw the grave of the prophet who had said this would happen"
2 Kings,23,17,"and he asked, “Whose grave is that?” Some people who lived nearby answered, “It belongs to the prophet from Judah who told what would happen to this altar.”"
2 Kings,23,18,"Josiah replied, “Then leave it alone. Don't dig up his bones.” So they did not disturb his bones or the bones of the old prophet from Israel who had also been buried there."
2 Kings,23,19,Some of the Israelite kings had made the LORD angry by building pagan shrines all over Israel. So Josiah sent troops to destroy these shrines just as he had done to the one in Bethel.
2 Kings,23,20,"He killed the priests who served at them and burnt their bones on the altars. After all that, Josiah went back to Jerusalem."
2 Kings,23,21,"Josiah told the people of Judah, “Celebrate Passover in honour of the LORD your God, just as it says in The Book of God's Law .”"
2 Kings,23,22,This festival had not been celebrated in this way since kings ruled Israel and Judah.
2 Kings,23,23,"But in Josiah's eighteenth year as king of Judah, everyone came to Jerusalem to celebrate Passover."
2 Kings,23,24,"Josiah got rid of every disgusting person and thing in Judah and Jerusalem—including magicians, fortune-tellers, and idols. He did his best to obey every law written in the book that the priest Hilkiah found in the LORD 's temple."
2 Kings,23,25,No other king before or after Josiah tried as hard as he did to obey the Law of Moses.
2 Kings,23,26,But the LORD was still furious with the people of Judah because Manasseh had done so many things to make him angry.
2 Kings,23,27,"The LORD said, “I will desert the people of Judah, just as I deserted the people of Israel. I will reject Jerusalem, even though I chose it to be mine. And I will abandon this temple built to honour me.”"
2 Kings,23,28,Everything else Josiah did while he was king is written in The History of the Kings of Judah.
2 Kings,23,29,"During Josiah's rule, King Neco of Egypt led his army north to the River Euphrates to help the king of Assyria. Josiah led his troops north to fight Neco, but when they met in battle at Megiddo, Josiah was killed."
2 Kings,23,30,"A few of Josiah's servants put his body in a chariot and took it back to Jerusalem, where they buried it in his own tomb. Then the people of Judah found his son Jehoahaz and poured olive oil on his head to show that he was their new king."
2 Kings,23,31,"Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled from Jerusalem only three months. His mother Hamutal was the daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah."
2 Kings,23,32,"Jehoahaz disobeyed the LORD , just as some of his ancestors had done."
2 Kings,23,33,King Neco of Egypt had Jehoahaz arrested and put in prison at Riblah near Hamath. Then he forced the people of Judah to pay him three thousand four hundred kilogrammes of silver and thirty-four kilogrammes of gold as taxes.
2 Kings,23,34,"Neco appointed Josiah's son Eliakim king of Judah, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. He took Jehoahaz as a prisoner to Egypt, where he died."
2 Kings,23,35,"Jehoiakim forced the people of Judah to pay higher taxes, so he could give Neco the silver and gold he demanded."
2 Kings,23,36,"Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he was appointed king, and he ruled eleven years from Jerusalem. His mother Zebidah was the daughter of Pedaiah from Rumah."
2 Kings,23,37,Jehoiakim disobeyed the LORD by following the example of his ancestors.
2 Kings,24,1,"During Jehoiakim's rule, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia invaded and took control of Judah. Jehoiakim obeyed Nebuchadnezzar for three years, but then he rebelled."
2 Kings,24,2,"At that time, the LORD started sending troops to rob and destroy towns in Judah. Some of these troops were from Babylonia, and others were from Syria, Moab, and Ammon. The LORD had sent his servants the prophets to warn Judah about this,"
2 Kings,24,3,"and now he was making it happen. The country of Judah was going to be wiped out, because Manasseh had sinned"
2 Kings,24,4,and caused many innocent people to die. The LORD would not forgive this.
2 Kings,24,5,Everything else Jehoiakim did while he was king is written in The History of the Kings of Judah.
2 Kings,24,6,"Jehoiakim died, and his son Jehoiachin became king."
2 Kings,24,7,King Nebuchadnezzar defeated King Neco of Egypt and took control of his land from the Egyptian Gorge all the way north to the River Euphrates. So Neco never invaded Judah again.
2 Kings,24,8,"Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled only three months from Jerusalem. His mother Nehushta was the daughter of Elnathan from Jerusalem."
2 Kings,24,9,"Jehoiachin disobeyed the LORD , just as his father Jehoiakim had done."
2 Kings,24,10,King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia sent troops to attack Jerusalem soon after Jehoiachin became king.
2 Kings,24,11,"During the attack, Nebuchadnezzar himself arrived at the city."
2 Kings,24,12,"Jehoiachin immediately surrendered, together with his mother and his servants, as well as his army officers and officials. Then Nebuchadnezzar had Jehoiachin arrested. These things took place in the eighth year of Nebuchadnezzar's rule in Babylonia."
2 Kings,24,13,"The LORD had warned that some day the treasures would be taken from the royal palace and from the temple, including the gold objects that Solomon had made for the temple. And that's exactly what Nebuchadnezzar ordered his soldiers to do."
2 Kings,24,14,"He also led away as prisoners the Jerusalem officials, the military leaders, and the skilled workers—ten thousand in all. Only the very poorest people were left in Judah."
2 Kings,24,15,"Nebuchadnezzar took Jehoiachin to Babylon, along with his mother, his wives, his officials, and the most important leaders of Judah."
2 Kings,24,16,"He also led away seven thousand soldiers, one thousand skilled workers, and anyone who would be useful in battle."
2 Kings,24,17,Then Nebuchadnezzar appointed Jehoiachin's uncle Mattaniah king of Judah and changed his name to Zedekiah.
2 Kings,24,18,"Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he was appointed king of Judah, and he ruled from Jerusalem for eleven years. His mother Hamutal was the daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah."
2 Kings,24,19,"Zedekiah disobeyed the LORD , just as Jehoiakim had done."
2 Kings,24,20,It was Zedekiah who finally rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar. The people of Judah and Jerusalem had made the LORD so angry that he finally turned his back on them. That's why these horrible things were happening.
2 Kings,25,1,"In Zedekiah's ninth year as king, on the tenth day of the tenth month, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia led his entire army to attack Jerusalem. The troops set up camp outside the city and built ramps up to the city walls."

1 Chronicles,10,13,"Saul died because he was unfaithful and disobeyed the LORD . He even asked advice from a woman who talked to spirits of the dead,"

1 Chronicles,11,1,"Israel's leaders met with David at Hebron and said, “We are your relatives,"
1 Chronicles,11,2,"and we know that you have led our army into battle, even when Saul was still our king. The LORD God has promised that you would rule our country and take care of us like a shepherd."
1 Chronicles,11,3,So we have come to crown you king of Israel.” David made an agreement with the leaders and asked the LORD to be their witness. Then the leaders poured olive oil on David's head to show that he was now king of Israel. This happened just as the LORD 's prophet Samuel had said.
1 Chronicles,11,4,"Jerusalem was called Jebus at the time, and David led Israel's army to attack the town."
1 Chronicles,11,5,"The Jebusites said, “You won't be able to get in here!” But David captured the fortress of Mount Zion, which is now called the City of David."
1 Chronicles,11,6,"David had told his troops, “The first soldier to kill a Jebusite will become my army commander.” And since Joab son of Zeruiah attacked first, he became commander."
1 Chronicles,11,7,"Later, David moved to the fortress—that's why it's called the City of David."
1 Chronicles,11,8,"He had the city rebuilt, starting at the landfill on the east side. Meanwhile, Joab supervised the repairs to the rest of the city."
1 Chronicles,11,9,"David became a great and strong ruler, because the LORD All-Powerful was on his side."
1 Chronicles,11,10,"The LORD had promised that David would become king, and so everyone in Israel gave David their support. Certain warriors also helped keep his kingdom strong."
1 Chronicles,11,11,"The first of these warriors was Jashobeam the son of Hachmoni, the leader of the Three Warriors. In one battle he killed three hundred men with his spear."
1 Chronicles,11,12,Another one of the Three Warriors was Eleazar son of Dodo the Ahohite.
1 Chronicles,11,13,"During a battle against the Philistines at Pas-Dammim, all the Israelite soldiers ran away,"
1 Chronicles,11,14,"except Eleazar, who stayed with David. They took their positions in a nearby barley field and defeated the Philistines! The LORD gave Israel a great victory that day."
1 Chronicles,11,15,One time the Three Warriors went to meet David among the rocks at Adullam Cave. The Philistine army had set up camp in Rephaim Valley
1 Chronicles,11,16,"and had taken over Bethlehem. David was in a fortress,"
1 Chronicles,11,17,"and he said, “I'm very thirsty. I wish I had a drink of water from the well by the gate to Bethlehem.”"
1 Chronicles,11,18,"The Three Warriors sneaked through the Philistine camp and got some water from the well near Bethlehem's gate. They took it back to David, but he refused to drink it. Instead, he poured out the water as a sacrifice to the LORD"
1 Chronicles,11,19,"and said, “Drinking this water would be like drinking the blood of these men who risked their lives to get it for me.” The Three Warriors did these brave deeds."
1 Chronicles,11,20,"Joab's brother Abishai was the leader of the Thirty Warriors, and in one battle he killed three hundred men with his spear. He was just as famous as the Three Warriors"
1 Chronicles,11,21,"and was more famous than the rest of the Thirty Warriors. He was their commander, but he never became one of the Three Warriors."
1 Chronicles,11,22,"Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was a brave man from Kabzeel who did some amazing things. One time he killed two of Moab's best fighters, and one snowy day he went into a pit and killed a lion."
1 Chronicles,11,23,"Another time he killed an Egyptian who was over two metres tall and was armed with a spear. Benaiah only had a club, so he grabbed the spear from the Egyptian and killed him with it."
1 Chronicles,11,24,"Benaiah did things like that; he was just as brave as the Three Warriors,"
1 Chronicles,11,25,even though he never became one of them. And he was certainly as famous as the rest of the Thirty Warriors. So David made him the leader of his own bodyguard.
1 Chronicles,12,1,"Some time earlier, David had gone to live in the town of Ziklag to escape from King Saul. While David was there, several brave warriors joined him to help fight his battles."
1 Chronicles,12,2,"Several of these warriors were from King Saul's own tribe of Benjamin. They were experts at using a bow and arrows, and they could shoot an arrow or sling a stone with either hand."
1 Chronicles,13,1,"Some time later, David talked with his army commanders,"
1 Chronicles,14,1,"King Hiram of Tyre sent some officials to David. They brought along carpenters and stone workers, and enough cedar logs to build David a palace."
1 Chronicles,14,2,David now knew that the LORD had made him a powerful king of Israel for the good of his people.
1 Chronicles,14,3,"After David moved to Jerusalem, he married more women and had more sons and daughters."
1 Chronicles,15,1,"David had several buildings built in Jerusalem, and he had a tent set up where the sacred chest would be kept."
1 Chronicles,15,2,"He said, “Only Levites will be allowed to carry the chest, because the LORD has chosen them to do that work and to serve him for ever.”"
1 Chronicles,15,3,"Next, David invited everyone to come to Jerusalem and watch the sacred chest being carried to the place he had set up for it."
1 Chronicles,15,4,He also sent for Aaron's descendants and for the Levites. The Levites who came were:
1 Chronicles,15,5,"Uriel, the leader of the Kohath clan, and one hundred and twenty of his relatives;"
1 Chronicles,15,6,"Asaiah, the leader of the Merari clan, and two hundred and twenty of his relatives;"
1 Chronicles,15,7,"Joel, the leader of the Gershon clan, and one hundred and thirty of his relatives;"
1 Chronicles,15,8,"Shemaiah, the leader of the Elizaphan clan, and two hundred of his relatives;"
1 Chronicles,15,9,"Eliel, the leader of the Hebron clan, and eighty of his relatives; and"
1 Chronicles,15,10,"Amminadab, the leader of the Uzziel clan, with one hundred and twelve of his relatives."
1 Chronicles,15,11,"David called together these six Levites and the two priests, Zadok and Abiathar."
1 Chronicles,15,12,"He said to them, “You are the leaders of the clans in the Levi tribe. You and your relatives must first go through the ceremony to make yourselves clean and acceptable to the LORD . Then you may carry the sacred chest that belongs to the LORD God of Israel and bring it to the place I have prepared for it."
1 Chronicles,15,13,"The first time we tried to bring the chest to Jerusalem, we didn't ask the LORD what he wanted us to do. He was angry with us, because you Levites weren't there to carry the chest.”"
1 Chronicles,15,14,The priests and the Levites made themselves clean. They were now ready to carry the sacred chest
1 Chronicles,15,15,"on poles that rested on their shoulders, just as the LORD had told Moses to do."
1 Chronicles,15,16,"David then told the leaders to choose some Levites to sing and play music on small harps, other stringed instruments, and cymbals."
1 Chronicles,16,1,"They put the sacred chest inside the tent that David had set up for it, then they offered sacrifices to please the LORD and sacrifices to ask his blessing."
1 Chronicles,16,2,"After David had finished, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD"
1 Chronicles,16,3,"and gave every person in the crowd a small loaf of bread, some meat, and a handful of raisins."
1 Chronicles,16,4,David appointed some of the Levites to serve at the sacred chest; they were to play music and sing praises to the LORD God of Israel.
1 Chronicles,16,5,"Asaph was their leader, and Zechariah was his assistant. Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-Edom, and another man named Jeiel were appointed to play small harps and stringed instruments. Asaph himself played the cymbals,"
1 Chronicles,16,6,and the two priests Benaiah and Jahaziel were to blow trumpets every day in front of the sacred chest.
1 Chronicles,16,7,"That same day, David instructed Asaph and his relatives for the first time to sing these praises to the LORD:"
1 Chronicles,16,8,Praise the LORD and pray in his name! Tell everyone what he has done.
1 Chronicles,16,9,Sing praises to the LORD! Tell about his miracles.
1 Chronicles,16,10,Celebrate and worship his holy name with all your heart.
1 Chronicles,16,11,Trust the LORD and his mighty power. Worship him always.
1 Chronicles,16,12,Remember his miracles and all his wonders and his fair decisions.
1 Chronicles,16,13,"You belong to the family of Israel, his servant; you are his chosen ones, the descendants of Jacob."
1 Chronicles,16,14,"The LORD is our God, bringing justice everywhere on earth."
1 Chronicles,16,15,"We must never forget his agreement and his promises, not in thousands of years."
1 Chronicles,17,1,"Soon after David moved into his new palace, he said to Nathan the prophet, “Look around! I live in a palace made of cedar, but the sacred chest is kept in a tent.”"
1 Chronicles,17,2,"Nathan replied, “The LORD is with you—do what you want.”"
1 Chronicles,17,3,"That night, the LORD told Nathan"
1 Chronicles,17,4,"to go to David and tell him: David, you are my servant, so listen carefully: you are not the one to build a temple for me."
1 Chronicles,17,5,"I didn't live in a temple when I brought my people out of Egypt, and I don't live in one now. A tent has always been my home wherever I have gone with them."
1 Chronicles,17,6,I chose special leaders and told them to be like shepherds for my people Israel. But did I ever say anything to even one of them about building a cedar temple for me?
1 Chronicles,17,7,"David, this is what I, the LORD All-Powerful, say to you. I brought you in from the fields where you took care of sheep, and I made you the leader of my people."
1 Chronicles,17,8,"Wherever you went, I helped you and destroyed your enemies right in front of your eyes. I have made you one of the most famous people in the world."
1 Chronicles,17,9,"I have given my people Israel a land of their own where they can live in peace. They will no longer have to tremble with fear—evil nations won't bother them, as they did"
1 Chronicles,17,10,"when I let judges rule my people, and I will keep your enemies from attacking you. Now I promise that like you, your descendants will be kings."
1 Chronicles,17,11,"I'll choose one of your sons to be king when you reach the end of your life and are buried beside your ancestors. I'll make him a strong ruler,"
1 Chronicles,17,12,and no one will be able to take his kingdom away from him. He will be the one to build a temple for me.
1 Chronicles,17,13,"I will be like a father to him, and he will be like a son to me. I will never put an end to my agreement with him, as I put an end to my agreement with Saul, who was king before you."
1 Chronicles,17,14,I will make sure that your son and his descendants will rule my people and my kingdom for ever.
1 Chronicles,17,15,Nathan told David exactly what the LORD had said.
1 Chronicles,17,16,"David went into the tent he had set up for the sacred chest. He sat there and prayed: LORD God, my family and I don't deserve what you have already done for us,"
1 Chronicles,17,17,and yet you have promised to do even more for my descendants. You are treating me as if I am a very important person.
1 Chronicles,17,18,"I am your servant, and you know my thoughts. What else can I say, except that you have honoured me?"
1 Chronicles,17,19,It was your choice to do these wonderful things for me and to make these promises.
1 Chronicles,17,20,"No other god is like you, LORD —you alone are God. Everything we have heard about you is true."
1 Chronicles,17,21,"And there is no other nation on earth like Israel, the nation you rescued from slavery in Egypt to be your own. You became famous by using great and wonderful miracles to force other nations and their gods out of your land, so that your people could live here."
1 Chronicles,17,22,"You have chosen Israel to be your people for ever, and you have become their God."
1 Chronicles,17,23," LORD God, please do what you promised me and my descendants."
1 Chronicles,17,24,"Then you will be famous for ever, and everyone will say, “The LORD All-Powerful rules Israel and is their God.” My kingdom will be strong,"
1 Chronicles,17,25,"because you are my God, and you have promised that my descendants will be kings. That's why I have the courage to pray to you like this, even though I am only your servant."
1 Chronicles,17,26,"You are the LORD God, and you have made this good promise to me."
1 Chronicles,17,27,"Now please bless my descendants for ever, and let them always be your chosen kings. You have already blessed my family, and I know you will bless us for ever."
1 Chronicles,18,1,"Later, David attacked and defeated the Philistines. He captured their town of Gath and the nearby villages."
1 Chronicles,18,2,"David also defeated the Moabites, and so they had to accept him as their ruler and pay taxes to him."
1 Chronicles,18,3,"While King Hadadezer of Zobah was trying to gain control of the territory near the River Euphrates, David met him in battle at Hamath and defeated him."
1 Chronicles,18,4,"David captured one thousand chariots, seven thousand chariot drivers, and twenty thousand soldiers. And he crippled all but one hundred of the horses."
1 Chronicles,18,5,"When troops from the Syrian kingdom of Damascus came to help Hadadezer, David killed twenty-two thousand of them."
1 Chronicles,18,6,"Then David stationed some of his troops in Damascus, and the people there had to accept David as their ruler and pay taxes to him. Everywhere David went, the LORD helped him win battles."
1 Chronicles,18,7,"Hadadezer's officers had carried gold shields, but David took these shields and brought them back to Jerusalem."
1 Chronicles,18,8,"He also took a lot of bronze from the cities of Tibhath and Cun, which had belonged to Hadadezer. Later, Solomon used this bronze to make the large bowl called the Sea, and to make the pillars and other furnishings for the temple."
1 Chronicles,19,1,"Some time later, King Nahash of Ammon died, and his son Hanun became king."
1 Chronicles,19,2,"David said, “Nahash was kind to me, so I will be kind to his son.” He sent some officials to Ammon to tell Hanun how sorry he was that his father had died. But when David's officials arrived at Ammon,"
1 Chronicles,19,3,"the Ammonite leaders said to Hanun, “Do you really believe King David is honouring your father by sending these men to comfort you? He probably sent them to spy on our country, so he can come and destroy it.”"
1 Chronicles,19,4,"Hanun arrested David's officials and had their beards shaved off and their robes cut off just below the waist, and then he sent them away."
1 Chronicles,19,5,"They were terribly ashamed. When David found out what had happened to his officials, he sent a message that told them, “Stay in Jericho until your beards grow back. Then you can come home.”"
1 Chronicles,19,6,The Ammonites realized they had made David furious. So they paid thirty-four thousand kilogrammes of silver to hire chariot troops from Mesopotamia and from the Syrian kingdoms of Maacah and Zobah.
1 Chronicles,19,7,"Thirty-two thousand troops, as well as the king of Maacah and his army, came and camped near Medeba. The Ammonite troops also left their towns and came to prepare for battle."
1 Chronicles,19,8,"David heard what was happening, and he sent out Joab with his army."
1 Chronicles,19,9,"The Ammonite troops marched to the entrance of the city and prepared for battle, while the Syrian troops took their positions in the open fields."
1 Chronicles,19,10,Joab saw that the enemy troops were lined up on both sides of him. So he picked some of the best Israelite soldiers to fight the Syrians.
1 Chronicles,19,11,Then he put his brother Abishai in command of the rest of the army and told them to fight against the Ammonites.
1 Chronicles,19,12,"Joab told his brother, “If the Syrians are too much for me to handle, come and help me. And if the Ammonites are too strong for you, I'll come and help you."
1 Chronicles,19,13,Be brave and fight hard to protect our people and the towns of our LORD God. I pray he will do whatever pleases him.”
1 Chronicles,19,14,"Joab and his soldiers attacked the Syrians, and the Syrians ran from them."
1 Chronicles,19,15,"When the Ammonite troops saw that the Syrians had run away, they ran from Abishai's soldiers and went back into their own city. Joab then returned to Jerusalem."
1 Chronicles,19,16,"As soon as the Syrians realized they had been defeated, they sent for their troops that were stationed on the other side of the River Euphrates. Shophach, the commander of Hadadezer's army, led these troops to Ammon."
1 Chronicles,19,17,"David found out what the Syrians were doing, and he brought Israel's entire army together. They crossed the River Jordan, and he commanded them to take their positions facing the Syrian troops. Soon after the fighting began,"
1 Chronicles,19,18,"the Syrians ran from Israel. David killed seven thousand chariot troops and forty thousand regular soldiers. He also killed Shophach, their commander."
1 Chronicles,19,19,"When the kings who had been under Hadadezer's rule saw that Israel had defeated them, they made peace with David and accepted him as their new ruler. The Syrians never helped the Ammonites again."
1 Chronicles,20,1,"The next spring, the time when kings go to war, Joab marched out in command of the Israelite army and destroyed towns all over the country of Ammon. He attacked the capital city of Rabbah and left it in ruins. But David stayed in Jerusalem."
1 Chronicles,20,2,"Later, David himself went to Rabbah, where he took the crown from the statue of their god Milcom. The crown was made of about thirty-four kilogrammes of gold, and there was a valuable jewel on it. David put the jewel on his crown, then carried off everything else of value."
1 Chronicles,20,3,"He forced the people of Rabbah to work with saws, iron picks, and axes. He also did the same thing with the people in all the other Ammonite towns. David then led Israel's army back to Jerusalem."
1 Chronicles,20,4,"Some time later, Israel fought a battle against the Philistines at Gezer. During this battle, Sibbecai from Hushah killed Sippai, a descendant of the Rephaim, and the Philistines were defeated."
1 Chronicles,20,5,"In another battle against the Philistines, Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath from Gath, whose spear shaft was like a weaver's beam."
1 Chronicles,20,6,"Another one of the Philistine soldiers who was a descendant of the Rephaim was as big as a giant and had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot. During a battle at Gath,"
1 Chronicles,20,7,"he made fun of Israel, so David's nephew Jonathan killed him."
1 Chronicles,20,8,David and his soldiers killed these three men from Gath who were descendants of the Rephaim.
1 Chronicles,21,1,Satan decided to cause trouble for Israel by making David think it was a good idea to find out how many people there were in Israel and Judah.
1 Chronicles,21,2,"David told Joab and the army commanders, “Count everyone in Israel, from the town of Beersheba in the south all the way north to Dan. Then I will know how many people can serve in my army.”"
1 Chronicles,21,3,"Joab answered, “Your Majesty, even if the LORD made your kingdom a hundred times larger, you would still rule everyone in it. Why do you need to know how many soldiers there are? Don't you think that would make the whole nation angry?”"
1 Chronicles,21,4,But David would not change his mind. And so Joab went everywhere in Israel and Judah and counted the people. He returned to Jerusalem
1 Chronicles,21,5,and told David that the total number of men who could serve in the army was one million one hundred thousand in Israel and four hundred and seventy thousand in Judah.
1 Chronicles,21,6,"Joab refused to include anyone from the tribes of Levi and Benjamin, because he still disagreed with David's orders."
1 Chronicles,21,7,"David's order to count the people made God angry, and he punished Israel."
1 Chronicles,21,8,"David prayed, “I am your servant. But what I did was stupid and terribly wrong. Please forgive me.”"
1 Chronicles,21,9,"The LORD said to Gad, one of David's prophets,"
1 Chronicles,21,10,“Tell David that I will punish him in one of three ways. But he will have to choose which one it will be.”
1 Chronicles,21,11,Gad went to David and told him: You must choose how the LORD will punish you:
1 Chronicles,21,12,"Will there be three years when the land won't grow enough food for its people? Or will your enemies constantly defeat you for three months? Or will the LORD send a horrible disease to strike your land for three days? Think about it and decide, because I have to give your answer to God who sent me."
1 Chronicles,21,13,"David was miserable and said, “It's a terrible choice to make! But the LORD is kind, and I'd rather be punished by him than by anyone else.”"
1 Chronicles,21,14,"So the LORD sent a horrible disease on Israel, and seventy thousand Israelites died."
1 Chronicles,21,15,"Then he sent an angel to destroy the city of Jerusalem. But just as the angel was about to do that, the LORD felt sorry for all the suffering he had caused the people, and he told the angel, “Stop! They have suffered enough.” This happened at the threshing place that belonged to Araunah the Jebusite."
1 Chronicles,21,16,"David saw the LORD 's angel in the air, holding a sword over Jerusalem. He and the leaders of Israel, who were all wearing sackcloth, bowed with their faces to the ground,"
1 Chronicles,21,17,"and David prayed, “It's my fault! I sinned by ordering the people to be counted. They have done nothing wrong—they are innocent sheep. LORD God, please punish me and my family. Don't let the disease wipe out your people.”"
1 Chronicles,21,18,The LORD 's angel told the prophet Gad to tell David that he must go to Araunah's threshing place and build an altar in honour of the LORD.
1 Chronicles,21,19,David followed the LORD 's instructions.
1 Chronicles,21,20,"Araunah and his four sons were threshing wheat at the time, and when they saw the angel, the four sons ran to hide."
1 Chronicles,21,21,"Just then, David arrived, and when Araunah saw him, he stopped his work and bowed down."
1 Chronicles,21,22,"David said, “Would you sell me your threshing place, so I can build an altar on it to the LORD ? Then this disease will stop killing the people. I'm willing to pay whatever you say it's worth.”"
1 Chronicles,21,23,"Araunah answered, “Take it, Your Majesty, and do whatever you want with it. I'll even give you the oxen for the sacrifice and the wheat for the grain sacrifice. And you can use the threshing boards for the fire. It's all yours!”"
1 Chronicles,21,24,"But David replied, “No! I want to pay you what they're worth. I can't just take something from you and then offer the LORD a sacrifice that cost me nothing.”"
1 Chronicles,21,25,So David paid Araunah six hundred gold coins for his threshing place.
1 Chronicles,21,26,"David built an altar and offered sacrifices to please the LORD and sacrifices to ask his blessing. David prayed, and the LORD answered him by sending fire down on the altar."
1 Chronicles,21,27,Then the LORD commanded the angel to put the sword away.
1 Chronicles,21,28,"When David saw that the LORD had answered his prayer, he offered more sacrifices there at the threshing place,"
1 Chronicles,22,1,"David said, “The temple of the LORD God must be built here at this threshing place. And the altar for offering sacrifices will also be here.”"
1 Chronicles,22,2,David ordered the foreigners living in Israel to come to Jerusalem. Then he assigned some to cut blocks of stone for building the temple.
1 Chronicles,22,3,"He got a large supply of iron to make into nails and hinges for the doors, and he provided so much bronze that it could not be weighed."
1 Chronicles,22,4,He also had cedar logs brought in from the cities of Sidon and Tyre.
1 Chronicles,22,5,"He said, “The temple for the LORD must be great, so that everyone in the world will know about it. But since my son Solomon is young and has no experience, I will make sure that everything is ready for the temple to be built.” That's why David did all these things before he died."
1 Chronicles,22,6,David sent for his son Solomon and told him to build a temple for the LORD God of Israel.
1 Chronicles,22,7,"He said: My son, I wanted to build a temple where the LORD my God would be worshipped."
1 Chronicles,22,8,"But some time ago, he told me, “David, you have killed too many people and have fought too many battles. That's why you are not the one to build my temple."
1 Chronicles,22,9,"But when your son becomes king, I will give him peace throughout his kingdom. His name will be Solomon, because during his rule I will keep Israel safe and peaceful."
1 Chronicles,22,10,"Solomon will build my temple. He will be like a son to me, and I will be like a father to him. In fact, one of his descendants will always rule in Israel.”"
1 Chronicles,22,11,"Solomon, my son, I now pray that the LORD your God will be with you and keep his promise to help you build a temple for him."
1 Chronicles,22,12,"May he give you wisdom and knowledge, so that you can rule Israel according to his Law."
1 Chronicles,22,13,"If you obey the laws and teachings that the LORD gave Moses, you will be successful. Be strong and brave and don't get discouraged or be afraid of anything."
1 Chronicles,22,14,"I have all the supplies you'll need to build the temple: you have more than three thousand tonnes of gold and over thirty-four thousand tonnes of silver. There's also plenty of wood, stone, and more bronze and iron than I could weigh. Ask for anything else you need."
1 Chronicles,22,15,I have also assigned men who will cut and lay the stone. And there are carpenters and people who are experts in working with
1 Chronicles,22,16,"gold, silver, bronze, and iron. You have plenty of workers to do the job. Now get started, and I pray that the LORD will be with you in your work."
1 Chronicles,22,17,David then gave orders for the leaders of Israel to help Solomon.
1 Chronicles,22,18,"David said: The LORD our God has helped me defeat all the people who lived here before us, and he has given you peace from all your enemies. Now this land belongs to the LORD and his people."
1 Chronicles,22,19,"Obey the LORD your God with your heart and soul. Begin work on the temple to honour him, so that the sacred chest and the things used for worship can be kept there."
1 Chronicles,23,1,David was old when he chose his son Solomon to be king of Israel.
1 Chronicles,23,2,"Some time later, David called together all of Israel's leaders, priests, and Levites."
1 Chronicles,23,3,"He then counted the Levite men who were at least thirty years old, and the total was thirty-eight thousand."
1 Chronicles,23,4,"He said, “Twenty-four thousand of the Levites will be in charge of the temple, six thousand will be temple officials and judges,"
1 Chronicles,23,5,"four thousand will be guards at the temple, and four thousand will praise the LORD by playing the musical instruments I have given them.”"
1 Chronicles,23,6,"David then divided the Levites into three groups according to the clans of Levi's sons, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari."
1 Chronicles,23,7,Gershon had two sons: Ladan and Shimei.
1 Chronicles,23,8,"Ladan was the father of Jehiel, Zetham, and Joel."
1 Chronicles,23,9,"They were all family leaders among their father's descendants. Shimei was the father of Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran."
1 Chronicles,24,1,"Aaron's descendants were then divided into work groups. Aaron had four sons: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar."
1 Chronicles,24,2,"But Nadab and Abihu died long before their father, without having any sons. That's why Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests."
1 Chronicles,24,3,"David divided Aaron's descendants into groups, according to their assigned work. Zadok, one of Eleazar's descendants, and Ahimelech, one of Ithamar's descendants, helped David."
1 Chronicles,24,4,"Eleazar's descendants were divided into sixteen groups, and Ithamar's were divided into eight groups, because Eleazar's family included more family leaders."
1 Chronicles,24,5,"However, both families included temple officials and priests, and so to make sure the work was divided fairly, David asked God what to do."
1 Chronicles,24,6,"As each group was assigned their duties, Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the Levite wrote down the name of the family leader in charge of that group. The witnesses were David and his officials, as well as Zadok the priest, Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the family leaders from the clans of the priests and the Levites."
1 Chronicles,25,1,"David and the temple officials chose the descendants of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun to be in charge of music. They were to praise the LORD by playing cymbals, harps and other stringed instruments. Here is a list of the musicians and their duties:"
1 Chronicles,25,2,"Asaph's four sons, Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asarelah, were under the direction of their father and played music whenever the king told them to."
1 Chronicles,25,3,"Jeduthun's six sons, Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, were under the direction of their father and played harps and sang praises to the LORD."
1 Chronicles,25,4,"Heman had fourteen sons: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, Romamtiezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, Mahazioth."
1 Chronicles,25,5,"Heman was one of the king's prophets, and God honoured Heman by giving him fourteen sons and three daughters."
1 Chronicles,25,6,"His sons were under his direction and played cymbals, harps, and other stringed instruments during times of worship at the temple. Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman took their orders directly from the king."
1 Chronicles,25,7,"There were two hundred and eighty-eight of these men, and all of them were skilled musicians."
1 Chronicles,25,8,"David assigned them their duties by asking the LORD what he wanted. Everyone was responsible for something, whether young or old, teacher or student."
1 Chronicles,26,1,The temple guards were also divided into groups according to clans. Meshelemiah son of Kore was from the Korah clan and was a descendant of Asaph.
1 Chronicles,26,2,"He had seven sons, who were born in the following order: Zechariah, Jediael, Zebadiah, Jathniel,"
1 Chronicles,26,3,"Elam, Jehohanan, and Eliehoenai."
1 Chronicles,27,1,"Each month a group of twenty-four thousand men served as soldiers in Israel's army. These men, which included the family leaders, army commanders, and officials of the king, were under the command of the following men, arranged by the month of their service:"
1 Chronicles,27,2,"In the first month, Jashobeam the son of Zabdiel,"
1 Chronicles,27,3,a descendant of Perez;
1 Chronicles,27,4,"in the second month, Dodai the Ahohite, whose assistant was Mikloth;"
1 Chronicles,27,5,"in the third month, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada the priest,"
1 Chronicles,27,6,"who was the leader of the Thirty Warriors, and whose son Ammizabad was also an army commander;"
1 Chronicles,27,7,"in the fourth month, Asahel the brother of Joab, whose son Zebadiah took over command after him;"
1 Chronicles,27,8,"in the fifth month, Shamhuth from the Izrah clan;"
1 Chronicles,27,9,"in the sixth month, Ira the son of Ikkesh from Tekoa;"
1 Chronicles,27,10,"in the seventh month, Helez from Pelon in the territory of Ephraim;"
1 Chronicles,27,11,"in the eighth month, Sibbecai from Hushah of the Zerah clan;"
1 Chronicles,27,12,"in the ninth month, Abiezer from Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin;"
1 Chronicles,27,13,"in the tenth month, Maharai from Netophah of the Zerah clan;"
1 Chronicles,27,14,"in the eleventh month, Benaiah from Pirathon in the territory of Ephraim;"
1 Chronicles,27,15,"in the twelfth month, Heldai from Netophah, who was a descendant of Othniel."
1 Chronicles,28,1,"David called a meeting in Jerusalem for all Israel's leaders, including the tribal leaders, the government officials, the army commanders, the officials in charge of the royal property and livestock, the palace officials, and the brave warriors."
1 Chronicles,28,2,"After everyone was there, David stood up and said: Listen to me, my people. I wanted to build a place where the sacred chest would be kept, so we could go there and worship the LORD our God. I have prepared all the supplies for building a temple,"
1 Chronicles,28,3,"but the LORD has refused to let me build it, because he said I have killed too many people in battle."
1 Chronicles,28,4,"The LORD God chose Judah to be the leading tribe in Israel. Then from Judah, he chose my father's family, and from that family, he chose me to be the king of Israel, and he promised that my descendants will also rule as kings."
1 Chronicles,28,5,"The LORD has blessed me with many sons, but he chose my son Solomon to be the next king of Israel."
1 Chronicles,28,6,"The LORD said to me, “Your son Solomon will build my temple, and it will honour me. Solomon will be like a son to me, and I will be like a father to him."
1 Chronicles,28,7,"If he continues to obey my laws and commands, his kingdom will never end.”"
1 Chronicles,28,8,"My friends, you are the LORD 's people. And now, with God as your witness, I want you to promise that you will do your best to obey everything the LORD God has commanded us. Then this land will always belong to you and your descendants."
1 Chronicles,28,9,"Solomon, my son, worship God and obey him with all your heart and mind, just as I have done. He knows all your thoughts and your reasons for doing things, and so if you turn to him, he will hear your prayers. But if you ignore him, he will reject you for ever."
1 Chronicles,28,10,The LORD has chosen you to build a temple for worshipping him. Be confident and do the work you have been assigned.
1 Chronicles,28,11,"After David finished speaking, he gave Solomon the plans for building the main rooms of the temple, including the porch, the storerooms, the rooms upstairs and downstairs, as well as the most holy place."
1 Chronicles,28,12,"He gave Solomon his plans for the courtyards and the open areas around the temple, and for the rooms to store the temple treasures and gifts that had been dedicated to God."
1 Chronicles,28,13,"David also gave Solomon his plans for dividing the priests and the Levites into groups, as well as for the work that needed to be done at the temple and for taking care of the objects used for worship."
1 Chronicles,28,14,"He told Solomon how much gold and silver was to be used in making the sacred objects,"
1 Chronicles,28,15,"including the lampstands and lamps,"
1 Chronicles,28,16,"the gold table which held the sacred loaves of bread, the tables made of silver,"
1 Chronicles,28,17,"the meat forks, the bowls and cups,"
1 Chronicles,28,18,"the gold incense altar, and the gold statue of a chariot for the winged creatures which were on the lid of the sacred chest."
1 Chronicles,28,19,David then said to Solomon: The LORD showed me how his temple is to be built.
1 Chronicles,28,20,"But you must see that everything is done according to these plans. Be confident, and never be afraid of anything or get discouraged. The LORD my God will help you do everything needed to finish the temple, so it can be used for worshipping him."
1 Chronicles,28,21,"The priests and Levites have been assigned their duties, and all the skilled workers are prepared to do their work. The people and their leaders will do anything you tell them."
1 Chronicles,29,1,"David told the crowd: God chose my son Solomon to build the temple, but Solomon is young and has no experience. This is not just any building—this is the temple for the LORD God!"
1 Chronicles,29,2,"That's why I have done my best to get everything Solomon will need to build it—gold, silver, bronze, iron, wood, onyx, turquoise, coloured gems, all kinds of precious stones, and marble."
1 Chronicles,29,3,"Besides doing all that, I have promised to give part of my own gold and silver as a way of showing my love for God's temple."
1 Chronicles,29,4,More than a hundred tonnes of my finest gold and almost two hundred and forty tonnes of my silver will be used to decorate its walls
1 Chronicles,29,5,"and to make the gold and silver objects. Now, who else will show their dedication to the LORD by giving gifts for building his temple?"
1 Chronicles,29,6,"After David finished speaking, the family leaders, the tribal leaders, the army commanders, and the government officials voluntarily gave gifts"
1 Chronicles,29,7,"for the temple. These gifts included more than a hundred and seventy tonnes of gold, over three hundred and forty tonnes of silver, six hundred and twenty tonnes of bronze, and more than three thousand four hundred tonnes of iron."
1 Chronicles,29,8,"Everyone who owned precious stones also donated them to the temple treasury, where Jehiel from the Levite clan of Gershon guarded them."
1 Chronicles,29,9,"David and the people were very happy that so much had been given to the LORD , and they all celebrated."
1 Chronicles,29,10,"Then, in front of everyone, David sang praises to the LORD: I praise you for ever, LORD ! You are the God our ancestor Jacob worshipped."
1 Chronicles,29,11,"Your power is great, and your glory is seen everywhere in heaven and on earth. You are king of the entire world,"
1 Chronicles,29,12,and you rule with strength and power. You make people rich and powerful and famous.
1 Chronicles,29,13,"We thank you, our God, and praise you."
1 Chronicles,29,14,"But why should we be happy that we have given you these gifts? They belong to you, and we have only given back what is already yours."
1 Chronicles,29,15,"We are only foreigners living here on earth for a while, just as our ancestors were. And we will soon be gone, like a shadow that suddenly disappears."
1 Chronicles,29,16,"Our LORD God, we have brought all these things for building a temple to honour you. They belong to you, and you gave them to us."
1 Chronicles,29,17,"But we are happy, because everyone has voluntarily given you these things. You know what is in everyone's heart, and you are pleased when people are honest."
1 Chronicles,29,18,"Always make us eager to give, and help us be faithful to you, just as our ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob faithfully worshipped you."
1 Chronicles,29,19,"And give Solomon the desire to obey your laws and teachings completely, and the desire to build the temple for which I have provided these gifts."
1 Chronicles,29,20,"David then said to the people, “Now it's your turn to praise the LORD , the God your ancestors worshipped!” So everyone praised the LORD , and they bowed down to honour him and David their king."
1 Chronicles,29,21,"The next day, the Israelites slaughtered a thousand bulls, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, and they offered them as sacrifices to please the LORD, along with offerings of wine."
1 Chronicles,29,22,"The people were very happy, and they ate and drank there at the LORD 's altar. That same day, Solomon was crowned king. The people celebrated and poured olive oil on Solomon's head to show that he would be their next king. They also poured oil on Zadok's head to show that he was their priest."
1 Chronicles,29,23,"So Solomon became king after David his father. Solomon was successful, and everyone in Israel obeyed him."
1 Chronicles,29,24,"Every official and every soldier, as well as all David's other sons, were loyal to him."
1 Chronicles,29,25,"The LORD made Solomon a great king, and the whole nation was amazed at how famous he was. In fact, no other king of Israel was as great as Solomon."
1 Chronicles,29,26,David the son of Jesse was king of Israel
1 Chronicles,29,27,for forty years. He ruled from Hebron for seven years and from Jerusalem for thirty-three years.
1 Chronicles,29,28,"David was rich and respected and lived to be an old man. Then he died, and his son Solomon became king."
1 Chronicles,29,29,"Everything David did while he was king is included in the history written by the prophets Samuel, Nathan, and Gad."
1 Chronicles,29,30,"They wrote about his powerful rule and about the things that happened not only to him, but also to Israel and the other nations."
2 Chronicles,1,1,"King Solomon, the son of David, was now in complete control of his kingdom, because the LORD God had blessed him and made him a powerful king."
2 Chronicles,2,1,"Solomon decided to build a temple where the LORD would be worshipped, and also to build a palace for himself."
2 Chronicles,2,2,He assigned seventy thousand men to carry building supplies and eighty thousand to cut stone from the hills. And he chose three thousand six hundred men to supervise these workers.
2 Chronicles,2,3,"Solomon sent the following message to King Hiram of Tyre: Years ago, when my father David was building his palace, you supplied him with cedar logs. Now will you send me supplies?"
2 Chronicles,2,4,"I am building a temple where the LORD my God will be worshipped. Sweet-smelling incense will be burnt there, and sacred bread will be offered to him. Worshippers will offer sacrifices to the LORD every morning and evening, every Sabbath, and on the first day of each month, as well as during all our religious festivals. These things will be done for all time, just as the LORD has commanded."
2 Chronicles,2,5,"This will be a great temple, because our God is greater than all other gods."
2 Chronicles,2,6,No one can ever build a temple large enough for God—even the heavens are too small a place for him to live in! All I can do is build a place where we can offer sacrifices to him.
2 Chronicles,2,7,"Send me a worker who can not only carve, but who can work with gold, silver, bronze, and iron, as well as make brightly-coloured cloth. The person you send will work here in Judah and Jerusalem with the skilled workers that my father has already hired."
2 Chronicles,2,8,"I know that you have workers who are experts at cutting timber in Lebanon. So would you please send me some cedar, pine, and juniper logs? My workers will be there to help them,"
2 Chronicles,2,9,because I'll need a lot of timber to build such a large and glorious temple.
2 Chronicles,2,10,"I will pay your woodcutters two thousand tonnes of wheat, the same amount of barley, four hundred thousand litres of wine, and that same amount of olive oil."
2 Chronicles,2,11,"Hiram sent his answer back to Solomon: I know that the LORD must love his people, because he has chosen you to be their king."
2 Chronicles,2,12,"Praise the LORD God of Israel who made heaven and earth! He has given David a son who is not only wise and clever, but who has the knowledge to build a temple for the LORD and a palace for himself."
2 Chronicles,2,13,I am sending Huram Abi to you. He is very bright.
2 Chronicles,2,14,"His mother was from the Israelite tribe of Dan, and his father was from Tyre. Not only is Huram an expert at working with gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone, and wood, but he can also make coloured cloth and fine linen. And he can carve anything if you give him a pattern to follow. He can help your workers and those hired by your father King David."
2 Chronicles,2,15,"Go ahead and send the wheat, barley, olive oil, and wine you promised to pay my workers."
2 Chronicles,2,16,"I will tell them to start cutting down trees in Lebanon. They will cut as many as you need, then tie them together into rafts, and float them down along the coast to Joppa. Your workers can take them to Jerusalem from there."
2 Chronicles,2,17,"Solomon counted all the foreigners who were living in Israel, just as his father David had done when he was king, and the total was 153,600."
2 Chronicles,2,18,"He assigned 70,000 of them to carry building supplies and 80,000 of them to cut stone from the hills. He chose 3,600 others to supervise the workers and to make sure the work was completed."
2 Chronicles,4,1,Solomon had a bronze altar made that was nine metres square and four and a half metres high.
2 Chronicles,4,2,"He also gave orders to make a large metal bowl called the Sea. It was four and a half metres across, just over two metres deep, and thirteen and a half metres around."
2 Chronicles,4,3,"Its outer edge was decorated with two rows of carvings of bulls, ten bulls to about every forty-five centimetres, all made from the same piece of metal as the bowl."
2 Chronicles,4,4,"The bowl itself sat on top of twelve bronze bulls, with three bulls facing outwards in each of four directions."
2 Chronicles,4,5,"The sides of the bowl were seventy-five millimetres thick, and its rim was in the shape of a cup that curved outwards like flower petals. The bowl held about sixty thousand litres."
2 Chronicles,4,6,"He also made ten small bowls and put five on each side of the large bowl. The small bowls were used to wash the animals that were burnt on the altar as sacrifices, and the priests used the water in the large bowl to wash their hands."
2 Chronicles,4,7,"Ten gold lampstands were also made according to the plans. Solomon placed these lampstands inside the temple, five on each side of the main room."
2 Chronicles,4,8,"He also made ten tables and placed them in the main room, five on each side. And he made a hundred small gold sprinkling bowls."
2 Chronicles,4,9,Solomon gave orders to build two courtyards: a smaller one that only priests could use and a larger one. The doors to these courtyards were covered with bronze.
2 Chronicles,4,10,The large bowl called the Sea was placed near the south-east corner of the temple.
2 Chronicles,4,11,"Huram made shovels, sprinkling bowls, and pans for hot ashes. Here is a list of the other furnishings he made for God's temple:"
2 Chronicles,4,12,"two columns, two bowl-shaped caps for the tops of these columns, two chain designs on the caps,"
2 Chronicles,4,13,"four hundred pomegranates for the chain designs,"
2 Chronicles,4,14,"the stands and the small bowls,"
2 Chronicles,4,15,"the large bowl and the twelve bulls that held it up,"
2 Chronicles,4,16,"pans for hot ashes, as well as shovels and meat forks. Huram made all these things out of polished bronze"
2 Chronicles,4,17,"by pouring melted bronze into the clay moulds he had set up near the River Jordan, between Succoth and Zeredah."
2 Chronicles,4,18,There were so many bronze furnishings that no one ever knew how much bronze it took to make them.
2 Chronicles,4,19,"Solomon also gave orders to make the following temple furnishings out of gold: the altar, the tables that held the sacred loaves of bread,"
2 Chronicles,4,20,"the lampstands and the lamps that burnt in front of the most holy place,"
2 Chronicles,4,21,"flower designs, lamps and tongs,"
2 Chronicles,4,22,"lamp snuffers, small sprinkling bowls, ladles, fire pans, and the doors to the most holy place and the main room of the temple."
2 Chronicles,5,1,"After the LORD 's temple was finished, Solomon put in its storage rooms everything that his father David had dedicated to the LORD , including the gold and silver, and the objects used in worship."
2 Chronicles,6,1,"Solomon prayed: “Our LORD , you said that you would live in a dark cloud."
2 Chronicles,6,2,Now I've built a glorious temple where you can live for ever.”
2 Chronicles,6,3,Solomon turned towards the people standing there. Then he blessed them
2 Chronicles,7,1,"As soon as Solomon finished praying, fire came down from heaven and burnt up the offerings. The LORD 's dazzling glory then filled the temple,"
2 Chronicles,7,2,and the priests could not go in.
2 Chronicles,7,3,"When the crowd of people saw the fire and the LORD 's glory, they knelt down and worshipped the LORD . They prayed: “The LORD is good, and his love never ends.”"
2 Chronicles,8,1,It took twenty years for the LORD 's temple and Solomon's palace to be built.
2 Chronicles,8,2,"After that, Solomon's workers rebuilt the towns that Hiram had given him. Then Solomon sent Israelites to live in those towns."
2 Chronicles,8,3,Solomon attacked and captured the town of Hamath-Zobah.
2 Chronicles,8,4,He made his workers build the town of Tadmor in the desert and some towns in Hamath where he could keep his supplies.
2 Chronicles,8,5,He strengthened Upper Beth-Horon and Lower Beth-Horon by adding walls and gates that could be locked.
2 Chronicles,8,6,"He did the same thing to the town of Baalath and to the cities where he kept supplies, chariots, and horses. Solomon made his workers build whatever he wanted in Jerusalem, Lebanon, and anywhere else in his kingdom."
2 Chronicles,9,1,"The Queen of Sheba heard how famous Solomon was, so she went to Jerusalem to test him with difficult questions. She took along several of her officials, and she loaded her camels with gifts of spices, jewels, and gold. When she arrived, she and Solomon talked about everything she could think of."
2 Chronicles,9,2,"He answered every question, no matter how difficult it was."
2 Chronicles,10,1,Rehoboam went to Shechem where everyone was waiting to crown him king.
2 Chronicles,10,2,"Jeroboam son of Nebat heard what was happening, and he returned from Egypt, where he had gone to hide from Solomon."
2 Chronicles,10,3,"The people from the northern tribes of Israel sent for him. Then together they went to Rehoboam and said,"
2 Chronicles,10,4,"“Your father Solomon forced us to work very hard. But if you make our work easier, we will serve you and do whatever you ask.”"
2 Chronicles,10,5,"Rehoboam replied, “Come back in three days for my answer.” So the people left."
2 Chronicles,10,6,"Rehoboam went to some leaders who had been his father's senior officials, and he asked them, “What should I tell these people?”"
2 Chronicles,10,7,"They answered, “If you want them to serve and obey you, then you should be kind and promise to make their work easier.”"
2 Chronicles,10,8,But Rehoboam refused their advice and went to the younger men who had grown up with him and were now his officials.
2 Chronicles,10,9,"He asked, “What do you think I should say to these people who asked me to make their work easier?”"
2 Chronicles,10,10,"His younger advisers said: Here's what we think you should say to them: “Compared to me, my father was weak."
2 Chronicles,10,11,"He made you work hard, but I'll make you work even harder. He punished you with whips, but I'll use whips with pieces of sharp metal!”"
2 Chronicles,10,12,"Three days later, Jeroboam and the others came back."
2 Chronicles,10,13,Rehoboam ignored the advice of the older advisers. He spoke bluntly
2 Chronicles,10,14,"and told them exactly what his own advisers had suggested. He said: “My father made you work hard, but I'll make you work even harder. He punished you with whips, but I'll use whips with pieces of sharp metal!”"
2 Chronicles,11,1,"After Rehoboam returned to Jerusalem, he decided to attack Israel and regain control of the whole country. So he called together one hundred and eighty thousand soldiers from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin."
2 Chronicles,11,2,"Meanwhile, the LORD had told Shemaiah the prophet"
2 Chronicles,11,3,"to tell Rehoboam and everyone from Judah and Benjamin,"
2 Chronicles,11,4,“The LORD warns you not to go to war against the people from the northern tribes—they are your relatives. Go home! The LORD is the one who made these things happen.” Rehoboam and his army obeyed the LORD 's message and did not attack Jeroboam and his troops.
2 Chronicles,11,5,"Rehoboam ruled from Jerusalem, and he had several cities in Judah turned into fortresses so he could use them to defend his country. These cities included"
2 Chronicles,11,6,"Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa,"
2 Chronicles,11,7,"Beth-Zur, Soco, Adullam,"
2 Chronicles,11,8,"Gath, Mareshah, Ziph,"
2 Chronicles,11,9,"Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah,"
2 Chronicles,11,10,"Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron. After he had fortified these cities in the territories of Judah and Benjamin,"
2 Chronicles,11,11,"he assigned an army commander to each of them and stocked them with supplies of food, olive oil, and wine,"
2 Chronicles,11,12,as well as with shields and spears. He used these fortified cities to keep control of Judah and Benjamin.
2 Chronicles,11,13,The priests and Levites from the northern tribes of Israel gave their support to King Rehoboam.
2 Chronicles,11,14,"And since Jeroboam and the kings of Israel who followed him would not allow any Levites to serve as priests, most Levites left their towns and pasture lands in Israel and moved to Jerusalem and other towns in Judah."
2 Chronicles,11,15,Jeroboam chose his own priests to serve at the local shrines in Israel and at the places of worship where he had set up statues of goat-demons and of calves.
2 Chronicles,11,16,"But some of the people from Israel wanted to worship the LORD God, just as their ancestors had done. So they followed the priests and Levites to Jerusalem, where they could offer sacrifices to the LORD."
2 Chronicles,11,17,"For the next three years, they lived in Judah and were loyal to Rehoboam and his kingdom, just as they had been loyal to David and Solomon."
2 Chronicles,11,18,"Rehoboam married Mahalath, whose father was Jerimoth son of David, and whose mother was Abihail the daughter of Eliab and granddaughter of Jesse."
2 Chronicles,11,19,"Rehoboam and Mahalath had three sons: Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham."
2 Chronicles,11,20,"Then Rehoboam married Maacah the daughter of Absalom. Their sons were Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith."
2 Chronicles,11,21,"Rehoboam had eighteen wives, but he also married sixty other women, and he was the father of twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters. Rehoboam loved his wife Maacah the most,"
2 Chronicles,11,22,so he chose their eldest son Abijah to be the next king.
2 Chronicles,11,23,Rehoboam was wise enough to put one of his sons in charge of each fortified city in his kingdom. He gave them all the supplies they needed and found wives for every one of them.
2 Chronicles,12,1,"Soon after Rehoboam had control of his kingdom, he and everyone in Judah stopped obeying the LORD."
2 Chronicles,12,2,"So in the fifth year of Rehoboam's rule, the LORD punished them for their unfaithfulness and allowed King Shishak of Egypt to invade Judah."
2 Chronicles,12,3,"Shishak attacked with his army of one thousand two hundred chariots and sixty thousand cavalry troops, as well as Egyptian soldiers from Libya, Sukkoth, and Ethiopia."
2 Chronicles,12,4,He captured every one of the fortified cities in Judah and then marched to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,12,5,"Rehoboam and the leaders of Judah had gone to Jerusalem to escape Shishak's invasion. And while they were there, Shemaiah the prophet told them, “The LORD says that because you have disobeyed him, he has now abandoned you. The LORD will not help you against Shishak!”"
2 Chronicles,12,6,"Rehoboam and the leaders were sorry for what they had done and admitted, “The LORD is right. We have deserted him.”"
2 Chronicles,12,7,"When the LORD heard this, he told Shemaiah: The people of Judah are truly sorry for their sins, and so I won't let Shishak completely destroy them. But because I am still angry,"
2 Chronicles,12,8,he will conquer and rule them. Then my people will know what it's like to serve a foreign king instead of serving me.
2 Chronicles,12,9,"Shishak attacked Jerusalem and took all the valuable things from the temple and from the palace, including Solomon's gold shields."
2 Chronicles,12,10,"Rehoboam had bronze shields made to replace the gold ones, and he ordered the guards at the city gates to keep them safe."
2 Chronicles,12,11,"Whenever Rehoboam went to the LORD 's temple, the guards carried the shields. But they always took them back to the guardroom as soon as he had finished worshipping."
2 Chronicles,12,12,"Rehoboam turned back to the LORD , and so the LORD did not let Judah be completely destroyed, and Judah was prosperous again."
2 Chronicles,12,13,"Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king, and he ruled seventeen years from Jerusalem, the city where the LORD had chosen to be worshipped. His mother Naamah was from Ammon. Rehoboam was a powerful king,"
2 Chronicles,12,14,but he still did wrong and refused to obey the LORD.
2 Chronicles,12,15,"Everything else Rehoboam did while he was king, including a history of his family, is written in the records of the two prophets, Shemaiah and Iddo. During Rehoboam's rule, he and King Jeroboam of Israel were constantly at war."
2 Chronicles,12,16,"When Rehoboam died, he was buried beside his ancestors in Jerusalem, and his son Abijah became king."
2 Chronicles,13,1,"Abijah became king of Judah in Jeroboam's eighteenth year as king of Israel,"
2 Chronicles,13,2,"and he ruled from Jerusalem for three years. His mother was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel from Gibeah. Some time later, Abijah and King Jeroboam of Israel went to war against each other."
2 Chronicles,13,3,"Abijah's army had four hundred thousand troops, and Jeroboam met him in battle with eight hundred thousand troops."
2 Chronicles,13,4,"Abijah went to the top of Mount Zemaraim in the hills of Ephraim and shouted: Listen, Jeroboam and all you Israelites!"
2 Chronicles,13,5,The LORD God of Israel has made a solemn promise that every king of Israel will be from David's family.
2 Chronicles,13,6,"But Jeroboam, you were King Solomon's official, and you rebelled."
2 Chronicles,13,7,"Then straight after Rehoboam became king, you and your bunch of worthless followers challenged Rehoboam, who was too young to know how to stop you."
2 Chronicles,13,8,Now you and your powerful army think you can stand up to the kingdom that the LORD has given to David's descendants. The only gods you have are those gold statues of calves that Jeroboam made for you.
2 Chronicles,13,9,"You don't even have descendants of Aaron on your side, because you forced out the LORD 's priests and Levites. In their place, you appoint ordinary people to be priests, just as the foreign nations do. In fact, anyone who brings a bull and seven rams to the altar can become a priest of your so called gods."
2 Chronicles,13,10,"But we have not turned our backs on the LORD God! Aaron's own descendants serve as our priests, and the Levites are their assistants."
2 Chronicles,13,11,"Twice every day they offer sacrifices and burn incense to the LORD . They set out the sacred loaves of bread on a table that has been purified, and they light the lamps in the gold lampstand every day at sunset. We follow the commands of the LORD our God—you have rejected him!"
2 Chronicles,13,12,"That's why God is on our side and will lead us into battle when the priests sound the signal on the trumpets. It's no use, Israelites. You might as well give up. There's no way you can defeat the LORD , the God your ancestors worshipped."
2 Chronicles,13,13,"But while Abijah was talking, Jeroboam had sent some of his troops to attack Judah's army from behind, while the rest attacked from the front."
2 Chronicles,13,14,"Judah's army realized they were trapped, and so they prayed to the LORD . The priests blew the signal on the trumpet,"
2 Chronicles,13,15,"and the troops let out a battle cry. Then with Abijah leading them into battle, God defeated Jeroboam and Israel's army."
2 Chronicles,13,16,"The Israelites ran away, and God helped Judah's soldiers slaughter"
2 Chronicles,13,17,five hundred thousand enemy troops.
2 Chronicles,13,18,Judah's army won because they had trusted the LORD God of their ancestors.
2 Chronicles,13,19,"Abijah kept up his attack on Jeroboam's army and captured the Israelite towns of Bethel, Jeshanah, and Ephron, as well as the villages around them."
2 Chronicles,13,20,"Jeroboam never regained his power during the rest of Abijah's rule. The LORD punished Jeroboam, and he died, but Abijah became more powerful."
2 Chronicles,13,21,"Abijah had a total of fourteen wives, twenty-two sons, and sixteen daughters."
2 Chronicles,13,22,Everything Abijah said and did while he was king is written in the records of Iddo the prophet.
2 Chronicles,14,1,"Abijah died and was buried in Jerusalem. Then his son Asa became king, and Judah had ten years of peace."
2 Chronicles,14,2,Asa obeyed the LORD his God and did right.
2 Chronicles,14,3,He destroyed the local shrines and the altars to foreign gods. He smashed the stone images of gods and cut down the sacred poles used in worshipping the goddess Asherah.
2 Chronicles,14,4,"Then he told everyone in Judah to worship the LORD God, just as their ancestors had done, and to obey his laws and teachings."
2 Chronicles,14,5,He destroyed every local shrine and incense altar in Judah.
2 Chronicles,14,6,"The LORD blessed Judah with peace while Asa was king, and so during that time, Asa fortified many of the towns."
2 Chronicles,14,7,"He said to the people, “Let's build walls and defence towers for these towns, and put in gates that can be locked with bars. This land still belongs to us, because we have obeyed the LORD our God. He has given us peace from all our enemies.” The people did everything Asa had suggested."
2 Chronicles,14,8,Asa had a large army of brave soldiers: three hundred thousand of them were from the tribe of Judah and were armed with shields and spears; two hundred and eighty thousand were from Benjamin and were armed with bows and arrows.
2 Chronicles,14,9,Zerah from Ethiopia led an army of a million soldiers and three hundred chariots to the town of Mareshah in Judah.
2 Chronicles,14,10,"Asa met him there, and the two armies prepared for battle in Zephathah Valley."
2 Chronicles,14,11,"Asa prayed: LORD God, only you can help a powerless army defeat a stronger one. So we depend on you to help us. We will fight against this powerful army to honour your name, and we know that you won't be defeated. You are the LORD our God."
2 Chronicles,14,12,"The LORD helped Asa and his army defeat the Ethiopians. The enemy soldiers ran away,"
2 Chronicles,14,13,but Asa and his troops chased them as far as Gerar. It was a total defeat—the Ethiopians could not even fight back! The soldiers from Judah took everything that had belonged to the Ethiopians.
2 Chronicles,14,14,The people who lived in the villages around Gerar learnt what had happened and were afraid of the LORD . So Judah's army easily defeated them and carried off everything of value that they wanted from these towns.
2 Chronicles,14,15,"They also attacked the camps where the shepherds lived and took a lot of sheep, goats, and camels. Then they went back to Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,15,1,"Some time later, God spoke to Azariah son of Oded."
2 Chronicles,15,2,"At once, Azariah went to Asa and said: Listen to me, King Asa and you people of Judah and Benjamin. The LORD will be with you and help you, as long as you obey and worship him. But if you disobey him, he will desert you."
2 Chronicles,15,3,"For a long time, the people of Israel did not worship the true God or listen to priests who could teach them about God. They refused to obey God's Law."
2 Chronicles,15,4,"But whenever trouble came, Israel turned back to the LORD their God and worshipped him."
2 Chronicles,15,5,There was so much confusion in those days that it wasn't safe to go anywhere in Israel.
2 Chronicles,15,6,"Nations were destroying each other, and cities were wiping out other cities, because God was causing trouble and unrest everywhere."
2 Chronicles,15,7,So you must be brave. Don't give up! God will honour you for obeying him.
2 Chronicles,15,8,"As soon as Asa heard what Azariah the prophet said, he gave orders for all the idols in Judah and Benjamin to be destroyed, including those in the towns he had captured in the territory of Ephraim. He also repaired the LORD 's altar that was in front of the temple porch."
2 Chronicles,15,9,"Asa called together the people from Judah and Benjamin, as well as the people from the territories of Ephraim, West Manasseh, and Simeon who were living in Judah. Many of these people were now loyal to Asa, because they had seen that the LORD was with him."
2 Chronicles,15,10,"In the third month of the fifteenth year of Asa's rule, they all met in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,15,11,"That same day, they took seven hundred bulls and seven thousand sheep and goats from what they had brought back from Gerar and sacrificed them as offerings to the LORD."
2 Chronicles,15,12,"They made a solemn promise to faithfully worship the LORD God their ancestors had worshipped,"
2 Chronicles,15,13,and to put to death anyone who refused to obey him.
2 Chronicles,15,14,"The crowd solemnly agreed to keep their promise to the LORD , then they celebrated by shouting and blowing trumpets and horns."
2 Chronicles,15,15,"Everyone was happy because they had made this solemn promise, and in return, the LORD blessed them with peace from all their enemies."
2 Chronicles,15,16,"Asa's grandmother Maacah had made a disgusting idol of the goddess Asherah, so he cut it down, crushed it, and burnt it in Kidron Valley. Then he removed Maacah from her position as queen mother."
2 Chronicles,15,17,"As long as Asa lived, he was faithful to the LORD , even though he did not destroy the local shrines in Israel."
2 Chronicles,15,18,He placed in the temple all the silver and gold objects that he and his father had dedicated to God.
2 Chronicles,15,19,There was peace in Judah until the thirty-fifth year of Asa's rule.
2 Chronicles,16,1,"In the thirty-sixth year of Asa's rule, King Baasha of Israel invaded Judah and captured the town of Ramah. He started making the town stronger, and he put troops there to stop people from going in and out of Judah."
2 Chronicles,16,2,"When Asa heard about this, he took the silver and gold from his palace and from the LORD 's temple. Then he sent it to Damascus with this message for King Benhadad of Syria:"
2 Chronicles,16,3,"“I think we should sign a peace treaty, just as our fathers did. This silver and gold is a present for you. Would you please break your treaty with King Baasha of Israel and force him to leave my country?”"
2 Chronicles,16,4,"Benhadad did what Asa asked and sent the Syrian army into Israel. They captured the towns of Ijon, Dan, Abel-Maim, and all the towns in Naphtali where supplies were kept."
2 Chronicles,16,5,"When Baasha heard about it, he stopped his work on the town of Ramah."
2 Chronicles,16,6,Asa ordered everyone in Judah to carry away the stones and wood Baasha had used to fortify Ramah. Then he fortified the towns of Geba and Mizpah with these same stones and wood.
2 Chronicles,16,7,"Soon after that happened, Hanani the prophet went to Asa and said: You depended on the king of Syria instead of depending on the LORD your God. And so, you will never defeat the Syrian army."
2 Chronicles,16,8,"Remember how powerful the Ethiopian and Libyan army was, with all their chariots and cavalry troops! You trusted the LORD to help you then, and you defeated them."
2 Chronicles,16,9,"The LORD is constantly watching everyone, and he gives strength to those who faithfully obey him. But you have done a foolish thing, and your kingdom will never be at peace again."
2 Chronicles,16,10,"When Asa heard this, he was so angry that he put Hanani in prison. Asa was also cruel to some of his people."
2 Chronicles,16,11,Everything Asa did while he was king is written in The History of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
2 Chronicles,16,12,"In the thirty-ninth year of his rule, he got a very bad foot disease, but he relied on doctors and refused to ask the LORD for help."
2 Chronicles,16,13,He died two years later.
2 Chronicles,16,14,"Earlier, Asa had his own tomb cut out of a rock hill in Jerusalem. So he was buried there, and the tomb was filled with spices and sweet-smelling oils. Then the people built a bonfire in his honour."
2 Chronicles,17,1,Jehoshaphat son of Asa became king and strengthened his defences against Israel.
2 Chronicles,17,2,"He assigned troops to the fortified cities in Judah, as well as to other towns in Judah and to those towns in Ephraim that his father Asa had captured."
2 Chronicles,18,1,Jehoshaphat was now very rich and famous. He signed a treaty with King Ahab of Israel by arranging the marriage of his son and Ahab's daughter.
2 Chronicles,18,2,"One day, Jehoshaphat went to visit Ahab in his capital city of Samaria. Ahab slaughtered sheep and cattle and prepared a big feast to honour Jehoshaphat and the officials with him. Ahab talked about attacking the city of Ramoth in Gilead,"
2 Chronicles,18,3,"and finally asked, “Jehoshaphat, would you go with me to attack Ramoth?” “Yes,” Jehoshaphat answered. “My army is at your command."
2 Chronicles,18,4,But first let's ask the LORD what to do.”
2 Chronicles,18,5,"Ahab sent for four hundred prophets and asked, “Should I attack the city of Ramoth?” “Yes!” the prophets answered. “God will help you capture the city.”"
2 Chronicles,18,6,"But Jehoshaphat said, “Just to make sure, is there another of the LORD 's prophets we can ask?”"
2 Chronicles,18,7,"“We could ask Micaiah son of Imlah,” Ahab said. “But I hate Micaiah. He always has bad news for me.” “Don't say that!” Jehoshaphat replied."
2 Chronicles,18,8,Then Ahab sent someone to bring Micaiah as soon as possible.
2 Chronicles,18,9,"All this time, Ahab and Jehoshaphat were dressed in their royal robes and were seated on their thrones at the threshing place near the gate of Samaria, listening to the prophets tell them what the LORD had said."
2 Chronicles,18,10,"Zedekiah son of Chenaanah was one of the prophets. He had made some horns out of iron and shouted, “Ahab, the LORD says you will attack the Syrians like a bull with iron horns and wipe them out!”"
2 Chronicles,18,11,All the prophets agreed that Ahab should attack the Syrians at Ramoth and promised that the LORD would help him defeat them.
2 Chronicles,18,12,"Meanwhile, the messenger who went to get Micaiah whispered, “Micaiah, all the prophets have good news for Ahab. Now go and say the same thing.”"
2 Chronicles,18,13,"“I'll say whatever the living LORD my God tells me to say,” Micaiah replied."
2 Chronicles,18,14,"Then Micaiah went up to Ahab, who asked, “Micaiah, should we attack Ramoth?” “Yes!” Micaiah answered. “The LORD will help you capture the city.”"
2 Chronicles,18,15,"Ahab shouted, “Micaiah, I've told you over and over again to tell me the truth! What does the LORD really say?”"
2 Chronicles,18,16,"Micaiah answered, “In a vision I saw Israelite soldiers wandering around, lost in the hills like sheep without a shepherd. The LORD said, ‘These troops have no leader. They should go home and not fight.’ ”"
2 Chronicles,18,17,"Ahab turned to Jehoshaphat and said, “I told you he would bring me bad news!”"
2 Chronicles,18,18,Micaiah replied: I then saw the LORD seated on his throne with every creature in heaven gathered around him.
2 Chronicles,18,19,"The LORD asked, “Who can trick Ahab and make him go to Ramoth where he will be killed?” They talked about it for a while,"
2 Chronicles,18,20,"then finally a spirit came forward and said to the LORD , “I can trick Ahab.” “How?” the LORD asked."
2 Chronicles,18,21,“I'll make Ahab's prophets lie to him.” “Good!” the LORD replied. “Now go and do it. You will be successful.”
2 Chronicles,18,22,"Ahab, this is exactly what has happened. The LORD made all your prophets lie to you, and he knows you will soon be destroyed."
2 Chronicles,18,23,"Zedekiah walked over and slapped Micaiah on the face. Then he asked, “Do you really think the LORD would speak to you and not to me?”"
2 Chronicles,18,24,"Micaiah answered, “You'll find out on the day you have to hide in the back room of some house.”"
2 Chronicles,18,25,"Ahab shouted, “Arrest Micaiah! Take him to Prince Joash and Governor Amon of Samaria."
2 Chronicles,18,26,Tell them to put him in prison and to give him nothing but bread and water until I come back safely.”
2 Chronicles,18,27,"Micaiah said, “If you do come back, I was wrong about what the LORD wanted me to say.” Then he told the crowd, “Don't forget what I said!”"
2 Chronicles,18,28,Ahab and Jehoshaphat led their armies to Ramoth in Gilead.
2 Chronicles,18,29,"Before they went into battle, Ahab said, “Jehoshaphat, I'll disguise myself, but you wear your royal robe.” Ahab disguised himself and went into battle."
2 Chronicles,18,30,The king of Syria had ordered his chariot commanders to attack only Ahab.
2 Chronicles,18,31,"So when they saw Jehoshaphat in his robe, they thought he was Ahab and started to attack him. But Jehoshaphat prayed, and the LORD made the Syrian soldiers stop."
2 Chronicles,18,32,"And when they realized he wasn't Ahab, they left him alone."
2 Chronicles,18,33,"However, during the fighting a soldier shot an arrow without even aiming, and it hit Ahab between two pieces of his armour. He shouted to his chariot driver, “I've been hit! Get me out of here!”"
2 Chronicles,18,34,"The fighting lasted all day, with Ahab propped up in his chariot so he could see the Syrian troops. He stayed there until evening, and by sundown he was dead."
2 Chronicles,19,1,Jehoshaphat returned safely to his palace in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,19,2,"But the prophet Jehu son of Hanani met him and said: By helping that wicked Ahab, you have made friends with someone who hates the LORD . Now the LORD God is angry with you!"
2 Chronicles,19,3,But not everything about you is bad. You destroyed the sacred poles used in worshipping the goddess Asherah—that shows you have tried to obey the LORD.
2 Chronicles,19,4,"Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem, but he often travelled through his kingdom, from Beersheba in the south to the edge of the hill country of Ephraim in the north. He talked with the people and convinced them to turn back to the LORD God and worship him, just as their ancestors had done."
2 Chronicles,19,5,He assigned judges to each of the fortified cities in Judah
2 Chronicles,19,6,"and told them: Be careful when you make your decisions in court, because these are the LORD 's people, and he will know what you decide."
2 Chronicles,19,7,So do your work in honour of him and know that he won't allow you to be unfair to anyone or to take bribes.
2 Chronicles,19,8,"Jehoshaphat also chose some Levites, some priests, and some of the family leaders, and he appointed them to serve as judges in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,19,9,He told them: Faithfully serve the LORD!
2 Chronicles,19,10,"The people of Judah will bring you legal cases that involve every type of crime, including murder. You must settle these cases and warn the people to stop sinning against the LORD , so that he won't get angry and punish Judah. Remember, if you follow these instructions, you won't be held responsible for anything that happens."
2 Chronicles,19,11,"Amariah the high priest will have the final say in any religious case. And Zebadiah, the leader of the Judah tribe, will have the final say in all other cases. The rest of the Levites will serve as your assistants. Be brave, and I pray that the LORD will help you do right."
2 Chronicles,20,1,"Some time later, the armies of Moab and Ammon, together with the Meunites, went to war against Jehoshaphat."
2 Chronicles,20,2,"Messengers told Jehoshaphat, “A large army from Edom east of the Dead Sea has invaded our country. They have already reached En-Gedi.”"
2 Chronicles,20,3,"Jehoshaphat was afraid, so he asked the LORD what to do. He then told the people of Judah to go without eating to show their sorrow."
2 Chronicles,20,4,They immediately left for Jerusalem to ask for the LORD 's help.
2 Chronicles,20,5,"After everyone from Judah and Jerusalem had come together at the LORD 's temple, Jehoshaphat stood in front of the new courtyard"
2 Chronicles,20,6,"and prayed: You, LORD , are the God our ancestors worshipped, and from heaven you rule every nation in the world. You are so powerful that no one can defeat you."
2 Chronicles,20,7,"Our God, you forced out the nations who lived in this land before your people Israel came here, and you gave it to the descendants of your friend Abraham for ever."
2 Chronicles,20,8,Our ancestors lived in this land and built a temple to honour you.
2 Chronicles,20,9,"They believed that whenever this land is struck by war or disease or famine, your people can pray to you at the temple, and you will hear their prayer and save them."
2 Chronicles,20,10,"You can see that the armies of Ammon, Moab, and Edom are attacking us! Those are the nations you would not let our ancestors invade on their way from Egypt, so these nations were not destroyed."
2 Chronicles,20,11,Now they are coming to take back the land you gave us.
2 Chronicles,20,12,Aren't you going to punish them? We won't stand a chance when this army attacks. We don't know what to do—we are begging for your help.
2 Chronicles,20,13,"While every man, woman, and child of Judah was standing there at the temple,"
2 Chronicles,20,14,"the LORD 's Spirit suddenly spoke to Jahaziel, a Levite from the Asaph clan."
2 Chronicles,20,15,"Then Jahaziel said: Your Majesty and everyone from Judah and Jerusalem, the LORD says that you don't need to be afraid or let this powerful army discourage you. God will fight on your side!"
2 Chronicles,20,16,So here's what you must do. Tomorrow the enemy armies will march through the desert around the town of Jeruel. March down and meet them at the town of Ziz as they come up the valley.
2 Chronicles,20,17,"You won't even have to fight. Just take your positions and watch the LORD rescue you from your enemy. Don't be afraid. Just do as you're told. And as you march out tomorrow, the LORD will be there with you."
2 Chronicles,20,18,Jehoshaphat bowed low to the ground and everyone worshipped the LORD.
2 Chronicles,20,19,Then some Levites from the Kohath and Korah clans stood up and shouted praises to the LORD God of Israel.
2 Chronicles,20,20,"Early the next morning, as everyone got ready to leave for the desert near Tekoa, Jehoshaphat stood up and said, “Listen my friends, if we trust the LORD God and believe what these prophets have told us, the LORD will help us, and we will be successful.”"
2 Chronicles,20,21,Then he explained his plan and appointed men to march in front of the army and praise the LORD for his holy power by singing: “Praise the LORD! His love never ends.”
2 Chronicles,20,22,"As soon as they began singing, the LORD confused the enemy camp,"
2 Chronicles,20,23,so that the Ammonite and Moabite troops attacked and completely destroyed those from Edom. Then they turned against each other and fought until the entire camp was wiped out!
2 Chronicles,20,24,"When Judah's army reached the tower that overlooked the desert, they saw that every soldier in the enemy's army was lying dead on the ground."
2 Chronicles,20,25,"So Jehoshaphat and his troops went into the camp to carry away everything of value. They found a large herd of livestock, a lot of equipment, clothes, and other valuable things. It took them three days to carry it all away, and there was still some left over."
2 Chronicles,20,26,"Then on the fourth day, everyone came together in Beracah Valley and sang praises to the LORD . That's why that place was called Praise Valley."
2 Chronicles,21,1,"Jehoshaphat died and was buried beside his ancestors in Jerusalem, and his son Jehoram became king."
2 Chronicles,21,2,"King Jehoshaphat had seven sons: Jehoram, Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, Michael, and Shephatiah."
2 Chronicles,21,3,"Jehoshaphat gave each of them silver and gold, as well as other valuable gifts. He also put them in charge of the fortified cities in Judah, but he had chosen his eldest son Jehoram to succeed him as king."
2 Chronicles,21,4,"After Jehoram had taken control of Judah, he had his brothers killed, as well as some of the nation's leaders."
2 Chronicles,21,5,"He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he ruled eight years from Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,21,6,"Jehoram married Ahab's daughter and followed the sinful example of Ahab's family and the other kings of Israel. He disobeyed the LORD by doing wrong,"
2 Chronicles,21,7,"but because the LORD had made a solemn promise to King David that someone from his family would always rule in Judah, he refused to wipe out David's descendants."
2 Chronicles,21,8,"While Jehoram was king, the people of Edom rebelled and chose their own king."
2 Chronicles,21,9,"Jehoram, his officers, and his cavalry marched to Edom, where the Edomite army surrounded them. He escaped during the night,"
2 Chronicles,21,10,"but Judah was never able to regain control of Edom. Even the town of Libnah rebelled at that time. Those things happened because Jehoram had turned away from the LORD , the God his ancestors had worshipped."
2 Chronicles,21,11,Jehoram even built local shrines in the hills of Judah and let the people sin against the LORD by worshipping foreign gods.
2 Chronicles,21,12,"One day, Jehoram received a letter from Elijah the prophet that said: I have a message for you from the LORD God your ancestor David worshipped. He knows that you have not followed the example of Jehoshaphat your father or Asa your grandfather."
2 Chronicles,21,13,"Instead you have acted like those sinful kings of Israel and have encouraged the people of Judah to stop worshipping the LORD , just as Ahab and his descendants did. You even murdered your own brothers, who were better men than you."
2 Chronicles,21,14,"Because you have done these terrible things, the LORD will severely punish the people in your kingdom, including your own family, and he will destroy everything you own."
2 Chronicles,21,15,You will be struck with a painful stomach disease and suffer until you die.
2 Chronicles,21,16,The LORD later caused the Philistines and the Arabs who lived near the Ethiopians to become angry with Jehoram.
2 Chronicles,21,17,"They invaded Judah and stole the royal property from the palace, and they led Jehoram's wives and sons away as prisoners. The only one left behind was Ahaziah, his youngest son."
2 Chronicles,21,18,"After this happened, the LORD struck Jehoram with an incurable stomach disease."
2 Chronicles,21,19,"About two years later, Jehoram died in terrible pain. No bonfire was built to honour him, even though the people had done this for his ancestors."
2 Chronicles,21,20,"Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he ruled eight years from Jerusalem. He died, and no one even felt sad. He was buried in Jerusalem, but not in the royal tombs."
2 Chronicles,22,1,"Earlier, when the Arabs led a raid against Judah, they killed all of Jehoram's sons, except Ahaziah, the youngest one. So the people of Jerusalem crowned him their king."
2 Chronicles,22,2,"He was twenty-two years old at the time, and he ruled only one year from Jerusalem. Ahaziah's mother was Athaliah, a granddaughter of King Omri of Israel,"
2 Chronicles,22,3,and she encouraged her son to sin against the LORD . He followed the evil example of King Ahab and his descendants.
2 Chronicles,22,4,"In fact, after his father's death, Ahaziah sinned against the LORD by appointing some of Ahab's relatives to be his advisers. Their advice led to his downfall."
2 Chronicles,22,5,"He listened to them and went with King Joram of Israel to attack King Hazael and the Syrian troops at Ramoth in Gilead. Joram was wounded in that battle,"
2 Chronicles,22,6,and he went to the town of Jezreel to recover. And Ahaziah later went there to visit him.
2 Chronicles,22,7,"It was during that visit that God had Ahaziah put to death. When Ahaziah arrived at Jezreel, he and Joram went to meet with Jehu, grandson of Nimshi. The LORD had already told Jehu to kill every male in Ahab's family,"
2 Chronicles,22,8,"and while Jehu was doing that, he saw some of Judah's leaders and Ahaziah's nephews who had come with Ahaziah. Jehu killed them on the spot,"
2 Chronicles,22,9,"then gave orders to find Ahaziah. Jehu's officers found him hiding in Samaria. They brought Ahaziah to Jehu, who immediately put him to death. They buried Ahaziah only because they respected Jehoshaphat his grandfather, who had done his best to obey the LORD. There was no one from Ahaziah's family left to become king of Judah."
2 Chronicles,22,10,"As soon as Athaliah heard that her son King Ahaziah was dead, she decided to kill any relative who could possibly become king. She would have done just that,"
2 Chronicles,22,11,"but Jehosheba rescued Joash son of Ahaziah just as the others were about to be murdered. Jehosheba, who was Jehoram's daughter and Ahaziah's half-sister, was married to Jehoiada the priest. So she was able to hide her nephew Joash and his personal servant in a bedroom in the LORD 's temple where he was safe from Athaliah."
2 Chronicles,22,12,Joash hid in the temple with them for six years while Athaliah ruled as queen of Judah.
2 Chronicles,23,1,"After Ahaziah's son Joash had hidden in the temple for six years, Jehoiada the priest knew that something had to be done. So he made sure he had the support of several army officers. They were Azariah son of Jeroham, Ishmael son of Jehohanan, Azariah son of Obed, Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat son of Zichri."
2 Chronicles,23,2,These five men went to the towns in Judah and called together the Levites and the clan leaders. They all came to Jerusalem
2 Chronicles,23,3,"and gathered at the temple, where they agreed to help Joash. Jehoiada said to them: Joash will be our next king, because long ago the LORD promised that one of David's descendants would always be king."
2 Chronicles,23,4,"Here is what we will do. Three groups of priests and Levites will be on guard duty on the Sabbath—one group will guard the gates of the temple,"
2 Chronicles,23,5,"one will guard the palace, and the other will guard Foundation Gate. The rest of you will stand guard in the temple courtyards."
2 Chronicles,23,6,"Only the priests and Levites who are on duty will be able to enter the temple, because they will be the only ones who have gone through the ceremony to make themselves clean and acceptable. The others must stay outside in the courtyards, just as the LORD has commanded."
2 Chronicles,23,7,You Levites must protect King Joash. Don't let him out of your sight! And keep your swords ready to kill anyone who comes into the temple.
2 Chronicles,23,8,"The Levites and the people of Judah followed Jehoiada's orders. The guards going off duty were not allowed to go home, and so each commander had all his guards available—those going off duty as well as those coming on duty."
2 Chronicles,23,9,"Jehoiada went into the temple and brought out the swords and shields that had belonged to King David, and he gave them to the commanders."
2 Chronicles,23,10,"They gave the weapons to the guards, and Jehoiada then made sure that the guards took their positions around the temple and the altar to protect the king on every side."
2 Chronicles,23,11,"Jehoiada and his sons brought Joash outside, where they placed the crown on his head and gave him a copy of the instructions for ruling the nation. Olive oil was poured on his head to show that he was now king, and the crowd cheered and shouted, “Long live the king!”"
2 Chronicles,23,12,"As soon as Queen Athaliah heard the crowd cheering for Joash, she went to the temple."
2 Chronicles,23,13,"There she saw Joash standing by one of the columns near the entrance, which was the usual place for the king. The commanders and the trumpet players were standing next to him, and the musicians were playing instruments and leading the people as they celebrated and blew trumpets. Athaliah tore her clothes in anger and shouted, “You betrayed me, you traitors!”"
2 Chronicles,23,14,"Straight away, Jehoiada said to the army commanders, “Don't kill her near the LORD 's temple. Take her out in front of the troops, and be sure to kill all her followers!”"
2 Chronicles,23,15,"She tried to escape, but the commanders caught and killed her near the gate where horses are led into the palace."
2 Chronicles,23,16,"Jehoiada asked King Joash and the people to join with him in being faithful to the LORD . They agreed,"
2 Chronicles,23,17,then rushed to the temple of the god Baal and tore it down. They smashed the altars and the idols and killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars.
2 Chronicles,23,18,"Jehoiada assigned the priests and Levites their duties at the temple, just as David had done. They were in charge of offering sacrifices to the LORD according to the Law of Moses, and they were responsible for leading the celebrations with singing."
2 Chronicles,23,19,Jehoiada ordered the guards at the temple gates to keep out anyone who was unclean.
2 Chronicles,23,20,"Finally, Jehoiada called together the army commanders, the most important citizens of Judah, and the government officials. The crowd of people followed them as they led Joash from the temple, through the Upper Gate, and into the palace, where he took his place as king of Judah."
2 Chronicles,23,21,Everyone celebrated because Athaliah had been killed and Jerusalem was peaceful again.
2 Chronicles,24,1,"Joash was only seven years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled forty years from Jerusalem. His mother Zibiah was from the town of Beersheba."
2 Chronicles,24,2,"While Jehoiada the priest was alive, Joash obeyed the LORD by doing right."
2 Chronicles,24,3,Jehoiada even chose two women for Joash to marry so he could have a family.
2 Chronicles,24,4,"Some time later, Joash decided it was time to repair the temple."
2 Chronicles,24,5,"He called together the priests and Levites and said, “Go everywhere in Judah and collect the annual tax from the people. I want this done straight away—we need that money to repair the temple.” But the Levites were in no hurry to follow the king's orders."
2 Chronicles,24,6,"So he sent for Jehoiada the high priest and asked, “Why didn't you send the Levites to collect the taxes? The LORD 's servant Moses and the people agreed long ago that this tax would be collected and used to pay for the upkeep of the sacred tent."
2 Chronicles,24,7,And now we need it to repair the temple because the sons of that evil woman Athaliah came in and wrecked it. They even used some of the sacred objects to worship the god Baal.”
2 Chronicles,24,8,"Joash gave orders for a wooden box to be made and had it placed outside, near the gate of the temple."
2 Chronicles,24,9,"He then sent letters everywhere in Judah and Jerusalem, asking everyone to bring their taxes to the temple, just as Moses had required their ancestors to do."
2 Chronicles,24,10,"The people and their leaders agreed, and they brought their money to Jerusalem and placed it in the box."
2 Chronicles,24,11,"Each day, after the Levites took the box into the temple, the king's secretary and the high priest's assistant would take out the money and count it. Then the empty box would be taken back outside. This happened day after day, and soon a large amount of money was collected."
2 Chronicles,24,12,"Joash and Jehoiada turned the money over to the men who were supervising the repairs to the temple. They used the money to hire stonecutters, carpenters, and experts in working with iron and bronze."
2 Chronicles,24,13,"These workers went straight to work repairing the temple, and when they had finished, it looked as good as new."
2 Chronicles,24,14,"They did not use all the tax money for the repairs, so the rest of it was handed over to Joash and Jehoiada, who then used it to make dishes and other gold and silver objects for the temple. Sacrifices to please the LORD were offered regularly in the temple for as long as Jehoiada lived."
2 Chronicles,24,15,"He died at the ripe old age of one hundred and thirty years,"
2 Chronicles,24,16,"and he was buried in the royal tombs in Jerusalem, because he had done so much good for the people of Israel, for God, and for the temple."
2 Chronicles,24,17,"After the death of Jehoiada the priest, the leaders of Judah went to Joash and talked him into doing what they wanted."
2 Chronicles,24,18,"Straight away, the people of Judah stopped worshipping in the temple of the LORD God, and they started worshipping idols and the symbols of the goddess Asherah. These sinful things made the LORD God angry with the people of Judah and Jerusalem,"
2 Chronicles,24,19,but he still sent prophets who warned them to turn back to him. The people refused to listen.
2 Chronicles,24,20,"God's Spirit spoke to Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest, and Zechariah told everyone that God was saying: “Why are you disobeying me and my laws? This will only bring punishment! You have deserted me, so now I will desert you.”"
2 Chronicles,25,1,"Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he ruled twenty-nine years from Jerusalem, the home town of his mother Jehoaddin."
2 Chronicles,25,2,"Even though Amaziah obeyed the LORD by doing right, he refused to be completely faithful."
2 Chronicles,25,3,"For example, as soon as he had control of Judah, he arrested and killed the officers who had murdered his father."
2 Chronicles,25,4,But the children of those officers were not killed; the LORD had commanded in the Law of Moses that only the people who sinned were to be punished.
2 Chronicles,25,5,"Amaziah sent a message to the tribes of Judah and Benjamin and called together all the men who were twenty years old and older. Three hundred thousand men went to Jerusalem, all of them ready for battle and able to fight with spears and shields. Amaziah grouped these soldiers according to their clans and put them under the command of his army officers."
2 Chronicles,25,6,Amaziah also paid about three thousand four hundred kilogrammes of silver to hire one hundred thousand soldiers from Israel.
2 Chronicles,25,7,"One of God's prophets said, “Your Majesty, don't let these Israelite soldiers march into battle with you. The LORD has refused to help anyone from the northern kingdom of Israel,"
2 Chronicles,25,8,"and so he will let your enemies defeat you, even if you fight hard. He is the one who brings both victory and defeat.”"
2 Chronicles,25,9,"Amaziah replied, “What am I supposed to do about all the silver I paid those troops?” “The LORD will give you back even more than you paid,” the prophet answered."
2 Chronicles,25,10,"Amaziah ordered the troops from Israel to go home, but when they left, they were furious with the people of Judah."
2 Chronicles,25,11,"After Amaziah got his courage back, he led his troops to Salt Valley, where he killed ten thousand Edomite soldiers in battle."
2 Chronicles,25,12,"He captured ten thousand more soldiers and dragged them to the top of a high cliff. Then he pushed them over the side, and they were all killed on the rocks below."
2 Chronicles,25,13,"Meanwhile, the Israelite troops that Amaziah had sent home, raided the towns in Judah between Samaria and Beth-Horon. They killed three thousand people and carried off their possessions."
2 Chronicles,25,14,"After Amaziah had defeated the Edomite army, he returned to Jerusalem. He took with him the idols of the Edomite gods and set them up. Then he bowed down and offered them sacrifices."
2 Chronicles,25,15,"This made the LORD very angry, and he sent a prophet to ask Amaziah, “Why would you worship these foreign gods that couldn't even save their own people from your attack?”"
2 Chronicles,25,16,"But before the prophet finished speaking, Amaziah interrupted and said, “You're not one of my advisers! Don't say another word, or I'll have you killed.” The prophet stopped. But then he added, “First you sinned and now you've ignored my warning. It's clear that God has decided to punish you!”"
2 Chronicles,25,17,"King Amaziah of Judah talked with his officials, then sent a message to King Jehoash of Israel: “Come out and face me in battle!”"
2 Chronicles,25,18,"Jehoash sent back a reply that said: Once upon a time, a small thorn bush in Lebanon arranged the marriage between his son and the daughter of a large cedar tree. But a wild animal came along and trampled the small bush."
2 Chronicles,25,19,"Amaziah, you think you're so powerful because you defeated Edom. But stay at home and do your celebrating. If you cause any trouble, both you and your kingdom of Judah will be destroyed."
2 Chronicles,25,20,"God made Amaziah stubborn because he was planning to punish him for worshipping the Edomite gods. Amaziah refused to listen to Jehoash's warning,"
2 Chronicles,25,21,so Jehoash led his army to the town of Beth-Shemesh in Judah to attack Amaziah and his troops.
2 Chronicles,25,22,"During the battle, Judah's army was crushed. Every soldier from Judah ran back home,"
2 Chronicles,25,23,"and Jehoash captured Amaziah. Jehoash took Amaziah with him when he went to attack Jerusalem. Jehoash broke down the city wall from Ephraim Gate to Corner Gate, a section nearly two hundred metres long."
2 Chronicles,25,24,"He carried away the gold, the silver, and all the valuable furnishings from God's temple where the descendants of Obed-Edom stood guard. He robbed the king's treasury, took hostages, then returned to Samaria."
2 Chronicles,25,25,Amaziah lived fifteen years after Jehoash died.
2 Chronicles,25,26,Everything else Amaziah did while he was king is written in The History of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
2 Chronicles,25,27,"As soon as Amaziah started disobeying the LORD , some people in Jerusalem plotted against Amaziah. He was able to escape to the town of Lachish, but another group of people caught him and killed him there."
2 Chronicles,25,28,His body was taken to Jerusalem on horseback and buried beside his ancestors.
2 Chronicles,27,1,"Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled from Jerusalem for sixteen years. Jerushah his mother was the daughter of Zadok."
2 Chronicles,27,2,"Jotham obeyed the LORD and did right. He followed the example of his father Uzziah, except he never burnt incense in the temple as his father had done. But the people of Judah kept sinning against the LORD."
2 Chronicles,27,3,Jotham rebuilt the Upper Gate of the temple and did a lot of work to repair the wall near Mount Ophel.
2 Chronicles,27,4,He built towns in the mountains of Judah and built fortresses and defence towers in the forests.
2 Chronicles,27,5,"During his rule he attacked and defeated the Ammonites. Then every year for the next three years, he forced them to pay three thousand four hundred kilogrammes of silver, one thousand tonnes of wheat, and one thousand tonnes of barley."
2 Chronicles,27,6,Jotham remained faithful to the LORD his God and became a very powerful king.
2 Chronicles,27,7,"Everything else Jotham did while he was king, including the wars he fought, is written in The History of the Kings of Israel and Judah."
2 Chronicles,27,8,"After he had ruled Judah sixteen years, he died at the age of forty-one."
2 Chronicles,27,9,"He was buried in Jerusalem, and his son Ahaz became king."
2 Chronicles,28,1,"Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled from Jerusalem for sixteen years. Ahaz was nothing like his ancestor David. Ahaz disobeyed the LORD"
2 Chronicles,28,2,"and was as sinful as the kings of Israel. He made idols of the god Baal,"
2 Chronicles,28,3,"and he offered sacrifices in Hinnom Valley. Worst of all, Ahaz sacrificed his own sons, which was a disgusting custom of the nations that the LORD had forced out of Israel."
2 Chronicles,28,4,"Ahaz offered sacrifices at the local shrines, as well as on every hill and in the shade of large trees."
2 Chronicles,29,1,"Hezekiah was twenty-five years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled twenty-nine years from Jerusalem. His mother was Abijah daughter of Zechariah."
2 Chronicles,29,2,"Hezekiah obeyed the LORD by doing right, just as his ancestor David had done."
2 Chronicles,29,3,"In the first month of the first year of Hezekiah's rule, he unlocked the doors to the LORD 's temple and had them repaired."
2 Chronicles,29,4,Then he called the priests and Levites to the east courtyard of the temple
2 Chronicles,29,5,"and said: It's time to purify the temple of the LORD God of our ancestors. You Levites must first go through the ceremony to make yourselves clean, then go into the temple and bring out everything that is unclean and unacceptable to the LORD."
2 Chronicles,29,6,"Some of our ancestors were unfaithful and disobeyed the LORD our God. Not only did they turn their backs on the LORD , but they also completely ignored his temple."
2 Chronicles,29,7,"They locked the doors, then let the lamps go out and stopped burning incense and offering sacrifices to him."
2 Chronicles,29,8,"The LORD became terribly angry with the people of Judah and Jerusalem, and everyone was shocked and horrified at what he did to punish them. Not only were"
2 Chronicles,29,9,"our ancestors killed in battle, but our own children and wives were taken captive."
2 Chronicles,29,10,So I have decided to renew our agreement with the LORD God of Israel. Perhaps then he will stop being so angry with us.
2 Chronicles,29,11,"Let's not waste any time, my friends. You are the ones who were chosen to be the LORD 's priests and to offer him sacrifices."
2 Chronicles,31,1,"After the Festival, the people went to every town in Judah and smashed the stone images of foreign gods and cut down the sacred poles for worshipping the goddess Asherah. They destroyed all the local shrines and foreign altars in Judah, as well as those in the territories of Benjamin, Ephraim, and West Manasseh. Then everyone went home."
2 Chronicles,31,2,"Hezekiah divided the priests and Levites into groups, according to their duties. Then he assigned them the responsibilities of offering sacrifices to please the LORD and sacrifices to ask his blessing. He also appointed people to serve at the temple and to sing praises at the temple gates."
2 Chronicles,31,3,"Hezekiah provided animals from his own herds and flocks to use for the morning and evening sacrifices, as well as for the sacrifices during the Sabbath celebrations, the New Moon Festivals, and the other religious feasts required by the Law of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,31,4,"He told the people of Jerusalem to bring the offerings that were to be given to the priests and Levites, so that they would have time to serve the LORD with their work."
2 Chronicles,31,5,"As soon as the people heard what the king wanted, they brought a tenth of everything they owned, including their best grain, wine, olive oil, honey, and other crops."
2 Chronicles,31,6,"The people from the other towns of Judah brought a tenth of their herds and flocks, as well as a tenth of anything they had dedicated to the LORD."
2 Chronicles,31,7,"The people started bringing their offerings to Jerusalem in the third month, and the last ones arrived four months later."
2 Chronicles,31,8,"When Hezekiah and his officials saw these offerings, they thanked the LORD and the people."
2 Chronicles,31,9,Hezekiah asked the priests and Levites about the large amount of offerings.
2 Chronicles,31,10,"The high priest at the time was Azariah, a descendant of Zadok, and he replied, “Ever since the people have been bringing us their offerings, we have had more than enough food and supplies. The LORD has certainly blessed his people. Look at how much is left over!”"
2 Chronicles,31,11,"So the king gave orders for storerooms to be built in the temple, and when they were completed,"
2 Chronicles,32,1,"After King Hezekiah had faithfully obeyed the LORD 's instructions by doing these things, King Sennacherib of Assyria invaded Judah. He attacked the fortified cities and thought he would capture every one of them."
2 Chronicles,32,2,"As soon as Hezekiah learnt that Sennacherib was planning to attack Jerusalem,"
2 Chronicles,33,1,"Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled fifty-five years from Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,33,2,Manasseh disobeyed the LORD by following the disgusting customs of the nations that the LORD had forced out of Israel.
2 Chronicles,33,3,He rebuilt the local shrines that his father Hezekiah had torn down. He built altars for the god Baal and set up sacred poles for worshipping the goddess Asherah. And he faithfully worshipped the stars in the sky.
2 Chronicles,33,4,"In the temple, where only the LORD was supposed to be worshipped, Manasseh built altars for pagan gods"
2 Chronicles,33,5,and for the stars. He placed these altars in both courtyards of the temple
2 Chronicles,34,1,"Josiah was eight years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled thirty-one years from Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,34,2,He followed the example of his ancestor David and always obeyed the LORD.
2 Chronicles,34,3,"When Josiah was only sixteen years old he began worshipping God, just as his ancestor David had done. Then, four years later, he decided to destroy the local shrines in Judah and Jerusalem, as well as the sacred poles for worshipping the goddess Asherah and the idols of foreign gods."
2 Chronicles,34,4,"He watched as the altars for the worship of the god Baal were torn down, and as the nearby incense altars were smashed. The Asherah poles, the idols, and the stone images were also smashed, and the pieces were scattered over the graves of their worshippers."
2 Chronicles,34,5,Josiah then had the bones of the pagan priests burnt on the altars. And so Josiah got rid of the worship of foreign gods in Judah and Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,34,6,"He did the same things in the towns and ruined villages in the territories of West Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, as far as the border of Naphtali."
2 Chronicles,34,7,"Everywhere in the northern kingdom of Israel, Josiah tore down pagan altars and Asherah poles; he crushed idols to dust and smashed incense altars. Then Josiah went back to Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,34,8,"In the eighteenth year of Josiah's rule in Judah, after he had got rid of all the sinful things from the land and from the LORD 's temple, he sent three of his officials to repair the temple. They were Shaphan son of Azaliah, Governor Maaseiah of Jerusalem, and Joah son of Joahaz, who kept the government records."
2 Chronicles,34,9,"These three men went to Hilkiah the high priest. They gave him the money that the Levite guards had collected from the people of West Manasseh, Ephraim, and the rest of Israel, as well as those living in Judah, Benjamin, and Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,34,10,"Then the money was turned over to the men who supervised the repairs to the temple. They used some of it to pay the workers,"
2 Chronicles,34,11,"and they gave the rest of it to the carpenters and builders, who used it to buy the stone and wood they needed to repair the other buildings that Judah's kings had not taken care of."
2 Chronicles,34,12,"The workers were honest, and their supervisors were Jahath and Obadiah from the Levite clan of Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam from the Levite clan of Kohath. Other Levites, who were all skilled musicians,"
2 Chronicles,34,13,were in charge of carrying supplies and supervising the workers. Other Levites were appointed to stand guard around the temple.
2 Chronicles,34,14,"While the money was being given to these supervisors, Hilkiah found the book that contained the laws that the LORD had given to Moses."
2 Chronicles,34,15,"Hilkiah handed the book to Shaphan the official and said, “Look what I found here in the temple— The Book of God's Law .”"
2 Chronicles,34,16,"Shaphan took the book to Josiah and reported, “Your officials are doing everything you wanted."
2 Chronicles,34,17,They have collected the money from the temple and have given it to the men supervising the repairs.
2 Chronicles,34,18,"But there's something else, Your Majesty. The priest Hilkiah gave me this book.” Then Shaphan read it aloud."
2 Chronicles,34,19,"When Josiah heard what was in The Book of God's Law , he tore his clothes in sorrow."
2 Chronicles,34,20,"At once he called together Hilkiah, Shaphan, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Abdon son of Micah, and his own servant Asaiah. He said,"
2 Chronicles,34,21,"“The LORD must be furious with me and everyone else in Israel and Judah, because our ancestors did not obey the laws written in this book. Go and find out what the LORD wants us to do.”"
2 Chronicles,34,22,"Hilkiah and the four other men left straight away and went to talk with Huldah the prophet. Her husband was Shallum, who was in charge of the king's clothes. Huldah lived in the northern part of Jerusalem, and when they met in her home,"
2 Chronicles,34,23,"she said: You were sent here by King Josiah, and this is what the LORD God of Israel says to him:"
2 Chronicles,34,24,"“Josiah, I am the LORD ! And I intend to punish this country and everyone in it, just as this book says."
2 Chronicles,34,25,The people of Judah and Israel have rejected me. They have offered sacrifices to foreign gods and have worshipped their own idols. I can't stand it any longer. I am furious.
2 Chronicles,35,1,"Josiah commanded that Passover be celebrated in Jerusalem to honour the LORD . So, on the fourteenth day of the first month, the lambs were killed for the Passover celebration."
2 Chronicles,35,2,"On that day, Josiah made sure the priests knew what duties they were to do in the temple."
2 Chronicles,35,3,"He called together the Levites who served the LORD and who taught the people his laws, and he said: No longer will you have to carry the sacred chest from place to place. It will stay in the temple built by King Solomon son of David, where you will serve the LORD and his people Israel."
2 Chronicles,35,4,"Get ready to do the work that David and Solomon assigned to you, according to your clans."
2 Chronicles,35,5,"Divide yourselves into groups, then arrange yourselves throughout the temple so that each family of worshippers will be able to get help from one of you."
2 Chronicles,35,6,"When the people bring you their Passover lamb, you must kill it and prepare it to be sacrificed to the LORD . Make sure the people celebrate according to the instructions that the LORD gave Moses, and don't do anything to make yourselves unclean and unacceptable."
2 Chronicles,35,7,"Josiah donated thirty thousand sheep and goats, and three thousand bulls from his own flocks and herds for the people to offer as sacrifices."
2 Chronicles,35,8,"Josiah's officials also voluntarily gave some of their animals to the people, the priests, and the Levites as sacrifices. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, who were the officials in charge of the temple, gave the priests twenty-six hundred sheep and lambs and three hundred bulls to sacrifice during the Passover celebration."
2 Chronicles,35,9,"Conaniah, his two brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel, as well as Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad were leaders of the Levites, and they gave the other Levites five thousand sheep and goats, and five hundred bulls to offer as sacrifices."
2 Chronicles,35,10,"When everything was ready to celebrate Passover, the priests and the Levites stood where Josiah had told them."
2 Chronicles,35,11,"Then the Levites killed and skinned the Passover lambs, and they handed some of the blood to the priests, who splattered it on the altar."
2 Chronicles,35,12,"The Levites set aside the parts of the animal that the worshippers needed for their sacrifices to please the LORD, just as the Law of Moses required. They also did the same thing with the bulls."
2 Chronicles,35,13,"They sacrificed the Passover animals on the altar and boiled the meat for the other offerings in pots, kettles, and pans. Then they quickly handed the meat to the people so they could eat it."
2 Chronicles,35,14,"All day long, the priests were busy offering sacrifices and burning the animals' fat on the altar. And when everyone had finished, the Levites prepared Passover animals for themselves and for the priests."
2 Chronicles,35,15,"During the celebration some of the Levites prepared Passover animals for the musicians and the guards, so that the Levite musicians would not have to leave their places, which had been assigned to them according to the instructions of David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the king's prophet. Even the guards at the temple gates did not have to leave their posts."
2 Chronicles,35,16,"So on that day, Passover was celebrated to honour the LORD , and sacrifices were offered on the altar to him, just as Josiah had commanded."
2 Chronicles,35,17,The worshippers then celebrated the Festival of Thin Bread for the next seven days.
2 Chronicles,35,18,"People from Jerusalem and from towns all over Judah and Israel were there. Passover had not been observed like this since the days of Samuel the prophet. In fact, this was the greatest Passover celebration in Israel's history!"
2 Chronicles,35,19,All these things happened in the eighteenth year of Josiah's rule in Judah.
2 Chronicles,35,20,"Some time later, King Neco of Egypt led his army to the city of Carchemish on the River Euphrates. And Josiah led his troops north to meet the Egyptians in battle."
2 Chronicles,35,21,"Neco sent the following message to Josiah: I'm not attacking you, king of Judah! We're not even at war. But God has told me to attack my enemy quickly. God is on my side, so if you try to stop me, he will punish you."
2 Chronicles,35,22,"But Josiah ignored Neco's warning, even though it came from God! Instead, he disguised himself and marched into battle against Neco in the valley near Megiddo."
2 Chronicles,35,23,"During the battle an Egyptian soldier shot Josiah with an arrow. Josiah told his servants, “Get me out of here! I've been hit.”"
2 Chronicles,35,24,"They carried Josiah out of his chariot, then put him in the other chariot he had there and took him back to Jerusalem, where he soon died. He was buried beside his ancestors, and everyone in Judah and Jerusalem mourned his death."
2 Chronicles,35,25,"Jeremiah the prophet wrote a funeral song in honour of Josiah. And since then, anyone in Judah who mourns the death of Josiah sings that song. It is included in the collection of funeral songs."
2 Chronicles,35,26,"Everything else Josiah did while he was king, including how he faithfully obeyed the LORD,"
2 Chronicles,35,27,is written in The History of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
2 Chronicles,36,1,"After the death of Josiah, the people of Judah crowned his son Jehoahaz their new king."
2 Chronicles,36,2,"He was twenty-three years old at the time, and he ruled only three months from Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,36,3,King Neco of Egypt captured Jehoahaz and forced Judah to pay three thousand four hundred kilogrammes of silver and thirty-four kilogrammes of gold as taxes.
2 Chronicles,36,4,Then Neco appointed Jehoahaz's brother Eliakim king of Judah and changed his name to Jehoiakim. He led Jehoahaz away to Egypt as his prisoner.
2 Chronicles,36,5,"Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he was appointed king, and he ruled eleven years from Jerusalem. Jehoiakim disobeyed the LORD his God by doing evil."
2 Chronicles,36,6,"During Jehoiakim's rule, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia invaded Judah. He arrested Jehoiakim and put him in chains, and he sent him to the capital city of Babylon."
2 Chronicles,36,7,"Nebuchadnezzar also carried off many of the valuable things in the LORD 's temple, and he put them in his palace in Babylon."
2 Chronicles,36,8,"Everything else Jehoiakim did while he was king, including all the disgusting and evil things, is written in The History of the Kings of Israel and Judah . His son Jehoiachin then became king."
2 Chronicles,36,9,"Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled only three months and ten days from Jerusalem. Jehoiachin also disobeyed the LORD by doing evil."
2 Chronicles,36,10,"In the spring of the year, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia had Jehoiachin arrested and taken to Babylon, along with more of the valuable items in the temple. Then Nebuchadnezzar appointed Zedekiah king of Judah."
2 Chronicles,36,11,"Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he was appointed king of Judah, and he ruled from Jerusalem for eleven years."
2 Chronicles,36,12,"He disobeyed the LORD his God and refused to change his ways, even after a warning from Jeremiah, the LORD 's prophet."
2 Chronicles,36,13,"King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia had forced Zedekiah to promise in God's name that he would be loyal. Zedekiah was stubborn and refused to turn back to the LORD God of Israel, so he rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar."
2 Chronicles,36,14,The people of Judah and even the priests who were their leaders became more unfaithful. They followed the disgusting example of the nations around them and made the LORD 's holy temple unfit for worship.
2 Chronicles,36,15,"But the LORD God felt sorry for his people, and instead of destroying the temple, he sent prophets who warned the people over and over again about their sins."
2 Chronicles,36,16,"But the people only laughed and insulted these prophets. They ignored what the LORD God was trying to tell them, until he finally became so angry that nothing could stop him from punishing Judah and Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,36,17,"The LORD sent King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia to attack Jerusalem. Nebuchadnezzar killed the young men who were in the temple, and he showed no mercy to anyone, whether man or woman, young or old. God let him kill everyone in the city."
2 Chronicles,36,18,Nebuchadnezzar carried off everything that was left in the temple; he robbed the treasury and the personal storerooms of the king and his officials. He took everything back to Babylon.
2 Chronicles,36,19,Nebuchadnezzar's troops burnt down the temple and destroyed every important building in the city. Then they broke down the city wall.
2 Chronicles,36,20,"The survivors were taken to Babylonia as prisoners, where they were slaves of the king and his sons, until Persia became a powerful nation."
2 Chronicles,36,21,"Judah was an empty desert, and it stayed that way for seventy years, to make up for all the years it was not allowed to rest. These things happened just as Jeremiah the LORD 's prophet had said."
2 Chronicles,36,22,"In the first year that Cyrus was king of Persia, the LORD told Cyrus to send a message to all parts of his kingdom. This happened just as Jeremiah the LORD 's prophet had promised."
2 Chronicles,36,23,"The message said: I am King Cyrus of Persia. The LORD God of heaven has made me the ruler of every nation on earth. He has also chosen me to build a temple for him in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. The LORD God will watch over any of his people who want to go back to Judah."
Ezra,1,1,"Years ago the LORD sent Jeremiah with a message about a promise for the people of Israel. Then in the first year that Cyrus was king of Persia, the LORD kept his promise by telling Cyrus to send this official message to all parts of his kingdom:"
Ezra,2,1,King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia had captured many of the people of Judah and had taken them as prisoners to Babylonia. Now they were on their way back to Jerusalem and to their own towns everywhere in Judah.
Ezra,3,1,"During the seventh month of the year, the Israelites who had settled in their towns went to Jerusalem."
Ezra,3,2,"The priest Joshua son of Jozadak, together with the other priests, and Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and his relatives rebuilt the altar of Israel's God. Then they were able to offer sacrifices there by following the instructions God had given to Moses."
Ezra,3,3,"And they built the altar where it had stood before, even though they were afraid of the people who were already living around there. Then every morning and evening they burnt sacrifices and offerings to the LORD."
Ezra,3,4,The people followed the rules for celebrating the Festival of Shelters and offered the proper sacrifices each day.
Ezra,3,5,"They offered sacrifices to please the LORD, sacrifices at each New Moon Festival, and sacrifices at the rest of the LORD 's festivals. Every offering the people had brought was presented to the LORD."
Ezra,3,6,"Although work on the temple itself had not yet begun, the people started offering sacrifices on the LORD 's altar on the first day of the seventh month of that year."
Ezra,3,7,"King Cyrus of Persia had said the Israelites could have cedar trees brought from Lebanon to Joppa by sea. So they sent grain, wine, and olive oil to the cities of Tyre and Sidon as payment for these trees, and they gave money to the stoneworkers and carpenters."
Ezra,3,8,"During the second month of the second year after the people had returned from Babylonia, they started rebuilding the LORD 's temple. Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Joshua son of Jozadak, the priests, the Levites, and everyone else who had returned started working. Every Levite over twenty years of age was put in charge of some part of the work."
Ezra,3,9,The Levites in charge of the whole project were Joshua and his sons and relatives and Kadmiel and his sons from the family of Hodaviah. The family of Henadad worked along with them.
Ezra,3,10,"When the builders had finished laying the foundation of the temple, the priests put on their robes and blew trumpets in honour of the LORD , while the Levites from the family of Asaph praised God with cymbals. All of them followed the instructions given years before by King David."
Ezra,3,11,They praised the LORD and gave thanks as they took turns singing: “The LORD is good! His faithful love for Israel will last for ever.” Everyone started shouting and praising the LORD because work on the foundation of the temple had begun.
Ezra,3,12,Many of the older priests and Levites and the heads of families cried aloud because they remembered seeing the first temple years before. But others were so happy that they celebrated with joyful shouts.
Ezra,3,13,Their shouting and crying were so noisy that it all sounded alike and could be heard a long way off.
Ezra,4,1,The enemies of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin heard that the people had come back to rebuild the temple of the LORD God of Israel.
Ezra,4,2,"So they went to Zerubbabel and to the family leaders and said, “Let us help! Ever since King Esarhaddon of Assyria brought us here, we have worshipped your God and offered sacrifices to him.”"
Ezra,4,3,"But Zerubbabel, Joshua, and the family leaders answered, “You cannot take part in building a temple for the LORD our God! We will build it ourselves, just as King Cyrus of Persia commanded us.”"
Ezra,4,4,Then the neighbouring people began to do everything possible to frighten the Jews and to make them stop building.
Ezra,4,5,"During the time when Cyrus was king and even until Darius became king, they kept bribing government officials to slow down the work."
Ezra,4,6,"In the first year that Xerxes was king, the neighbouring people brought written charges against the people of Judah and Jerusalem."
Ezra,4,7,"Later, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and their advisers got together and wrote a letter to Artaxerxes when he was king of Persia. It was written in Aramaic and had to be translated."
Ezra,5,1,Then the LORD God of Israel told the prophets Haggai and Zechariah to speak in his name to the people of Judah and Jerusalem. And they did.
Ezra,5,2,"So Zerubbabel the governor and Joshua the priest urged the people to start working on the temple again, and God's prophets encouraged them."
Ezra,5,3,"Governor Tattenai of Western Province and his assistant Shethar Bozenai got together with some of their officials. Then they went to Jerusalem and said to the people, “Who told you to rebuild this temple?"
Ezra,5,4,Give us the names of the workers!”
Ezra,5,5,But God was looking after the Jewish leaders. So the governor and his group decided not to make the people stop working on the temple until they could report to Darius and get his advice.
Ezra,5,6,"Governor Tattenai, Shethar Bozenai, and their advisers sent a report to Darius,"
Ezra,5,7,"which said: King Darius, we wish you the best!"
Ezra,5,8,"We went to Judah, where the temple of the great God is being built with huge stones and wooden beams set in the walls. Everyone is working hard, and the building is going up fast."
Ezra,5,9,We asked those in charge to tell us who gave them permission to rebuild the temple.
Ezra,5,10,"We also asked for the names of their leaders, so that we could write them down for you."
Ezra,5,11,They claimed to be servants of the God who rules heaven and earth. And they said they were rebuilding the temple that was built many years ago by one of Israel's greatest kings.
Ezra,5,12,"We were told that their people had made God angry, and he let them be captured by Nebuchadnezzar, the Babylonian king who took them away as captives to Babylonia. Nebuchadnezzar tore down their temple,"
Ezra,6,1,King Darius ordered someone to go through the old records kept in Babylonia.
Ezra,6,2,"Finally, a scroll was found in Ecbatana, the capital of Media Province, and it said: This official record will show"
Ezra,6,3,"that in the first year Cyrus was king, he gave orders to rebuild God's temple in Jerusalem, so that sacrifices and offerings could be presented there. It is to be built twenty-seven metres high and twenty-seven metres wide,"
Ezra,6,4,with one row of wooden beams for each three rows of large stones. The royal treasury will pay for everything.
Ezra,6,5,Then return to their proper places the gold and silver things that Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple and brought to Babylonia.
Ezra,6,6,"King Darius sent this message: Governor Tattenai of Western Province and Shethar Bozenai, you and your advisers must stay away from the temple."
Ezra,6,7,Let the Jewish governor and leaders rebuild it where it stood before. And stop slowing them down!
Ezra,6,8,"Starting at once, I am ordering you to help the leaders by paying their expenses from the tax money collected in Western Province."
Ezra,6,9,"And don't fail to let the priests in Jerusalem have whatever they need each day so they can offer sacrifices to the God of heaven. Give them young bulls, rams, sheep, as well as wheat, salt, wine, and olive oil."
Ezra,6,10,I want them to be able to offer pleasing sacrifices to God and to pray for me and my family.
Ezra,6,11,"If any of you don't obey this order, a wooden beam will be taken from your house and sharpened on one end. Then it will be driven through your body, and your house will be torn down and turned into a rubbish dump."
Ezra,6,12,"I ask the God who is worshipped in Jerusalem to destroy any king or nation who tries either to change what I have said or to tear down his temple. I, Darius, give these orders, and I expect them to be followed carefully."
Ezra,6,13,"Governor Tattenai, Shethar Bozenai, and their advisers carefully obeyed King Darius."
Ezra,6,14,"With great success the Jewish leaders continued working on the temple, while Haggai and Zechariah encouraged them by their preaching. And so, the temple was completed at the command of the God of Israel and by the orders of kings Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes of Persia."
Ezra,6,15,"On the third day of the month of Adar in the sixth year of the rule of Darius, the temple was finished."
Ezra,6,16,"The people of Israel, the priests, the Levites, and everyone else who had returned from exile were happy and celebrated as they dedicated God's temple."
Ezra,6,17,"One hundred bulls, two hundred rams, and four hundred lambs were offered as sacrifices at the dedication. Also twelve goats were sacrificed as sin offerings for the twelve tribes of Israel."
Ezra,6,18,"Then the priests and Levites were assigned their duties in God's temple in Jerusalem, according to the instructions Moses had written."
Ezra,6,19,Everyone who had returned from exile celebrated Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.
Ezra,6,20,"The priests and Levites had gone through a ceremony to make themselves acceptable to lead in worship. Then some of them killed Passover lambs for those who had returned, including the other priests and themselves."
Ezra,6,21,The sacrifices were eaten by the Israelites who had returned and by the neighbouring people who had given up the sinful customs of other nations in order to worship the LORD God of Israel.
Ezra,6,22,For seven days they celebrated the Festival of Thin Bread. Everyone was happy because the LORD God of Israel had made sure that the king of Assyria would be kind to them and help them build the temple.
Ezra,8,1,Artaxerxes was king of Persia when I led the following chiefs of the family groups from Babylonia to Jerusalem:
Ezra,9,1,"Later the Jewish leaders came to me and said: Many Israelites, including priests and Levites, are living just like the people around them. They are even guilty of some of the horrible sins of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites."
Ezra,9,2,"Some Israelite men have married foreign women and have let their sons do the same thing. Our own officials and leaders were the first to commit this disgusting sin, and now God's holy people are mixed with foreigners."
Ezra,9,3,This news made me so angry that I ripped my clothes and tore hair from my head and beard. Then I just sat in shock
Ezra,9,4,"until time for the evening sacrifice. Many of our people were greatly concerned and gathered around me, because the God of Israel had warned us to stay away from foreigners."
Ezra,9,5,"At the time of the evening sacrifice, I was still sitting there in sorrow with my clothes all torn. So I got down on my knees, then lifted my arms,"
Ezra,9,6,"and prayed: I am much too ashamed to face you, LORD God. Our sins and our guilt have swept over us like a flood that reaches up to the heavens."
Ezra,9,7,"Since the time of our ancestors, all of us have sinned. That's why we, our kings, and our priests have often been defeated by other kings. They have killed some of us and made slaves of others; they have taken our possessions and made us ashamed, just as we are today."
Ezra,9,8,"But for now, LORD God, you have shown great kindness to us. You made us truly happy by letting some of us settle in this sacred place and by helping us in our time of slavery."
Ezra,9,9,"We are slaves, but you have never turned your back on us. You love us, and because of you, the kings of Persia have helped us. It's as though you have given us new life! You let us rebuild your temple and live safely in Judah and Jerusalem."
Ezra,9,10,"Our God, what can we say now? Even after all this, we have disobeyed the commands"
Ezra,9,11,"that were given to us by your servants the prophets. They said the land you are giving us is full of sinful and wicked people, who never stop doing disgusting things."
Ezra,9,12,"And we were warned not to let our daughters and sons marry their sons and daughters. Your prophets also told us never to help those foreigners or even let them live in peace. You wanted us to become strong and to enjoy the good things in the land, then some day to leave it to our children for ever."
Ezra,9,13,"You punished us because of our terrible sins. But you did not punish us nearly as much as we deserve, and you have brought some of us back home."
Ezra,9,14,Why should we disobey your commands again by letting our sons and daughters marry these foreigners who do such disgusting things? That would make you angry enough to destroy us all!
Ezra,9,15,"LORD God of Israel, you have been more than fair by letting a few of us survive. But once again, our sins have made us ashamed to face you."
Ezra,10,1,"While Ezra was down on his knees in front of God's temple, praying with tears in his eyes, and confessing the sins of the people of Israel, a large number of men, women, and children gathered around him and cried bitterly."
Ezra,10,2,"Shecaniah son of Jehiel from the family of Elam said: Ezra, we have disobeyed God by marrying these foreign women. But there is still hope for the people of Israel,"
Ezra,10,3,"if we follow your advice and the advice of others who truly respect the laws of God. We must promise God that we will divorce our foreign wives and send them away, together with their children."
Ezra,10,4,"Ezra, it's up to you to do something! We will support whatever you do. So be brave!"
Ezra,10,5,"Ezra stood up and made the chief priests, the Levites, and everyone else in Israel swear that they would follow the advice of Shecaniah."
Ezra,10,6,"Then Ezra left God's temple and went to spend the night in the living quarters of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. He felt sorry for what the people had done, and he did not eat or drink a thing."
Nehemiah,1,1,"I am Nehemiah son of Hacaliah, and in this book I tell what I have done. During the month of Chislev in the twentieth year that Artaxerxes ruled Persia, I was in his fortress city of Susa,"
Nehemiah,1,2,when my brother Hanani came with some men from Judah. So I asked them about the Jews who had escaped from being captives in Babylonia. I also asked them about the city of Jerusalem.
Nehemiah,1,3,"They told me, “Those captives who have come back are having all kinds of troubles. They are terribly disgraced, Jerusalem's walls are broken down, and its gates have been burnt.”"
Nehemiah,1,4,"When I heard this, I sat down and cried. Then for several days, I mourned; I went without eating to show my sorrow, and I prayed:"
Nehemiah,1,5," LORD God of heaven, you are great and fearsome. And you faithfully keep your promises to everyone who loves you and obeys your commands."
Nehemiah,1,6,"I am your servant, so please have mercy on me and answer the prayer that I make day and night for these people of Israel who serve you. I, my family, and the rest of your people have sinned"
Nehemiah,1,7,by choosing to disobey you and the laws and teachings you gave to your servant Moses.
Nehemiah,1,8,"Please remember the promise you made to Moses. You told him that if we were unfaithful, you would scatter us among foreign nations."
Nehemiah,1,9,"But you also said that no matter how far away we were, we could turn to you and start obeying your laws. Then you would bring us back to the place where you have chosen to be worshipped."
Nehemiah,1,10,"Our LORD , I am praying for your servants—those you rescued by your great strength and mighty power."
Nehemiah,1,11,"Please answer my prayer and the prayer of your other servants who gladly honour your name. When I serve the king his wine today, make him pleased with me and let him do what I ask."
Nehemiah,2,1,"During the month of Nisan in the twentieth year that Artaxerxes was king, I served him his wine, as I had done before. But this was the first time I had ever looked depressed."
Nehemiah,2,2,"So the king said, “Why do you look so sad? You're not sick. Something must be bothering you.” Even though I was frightened,"
Nehemiah,2,3,"I answered, “Your Majesty, I hope you live for ever! I feel sad because the city where my ancestors are buried is in ruins, and its gates have been burnt down.”"
Nehemiah,2,4,"The king asked, “What do you want me to do?” I prayed to the God who rules from heaven."
Nehemiah,2,5,"Then I told the king, “Sir, if it's all right with you, please send me back to Judah, so that I can rebuild the city where my ancestors are buried.”"
Nehemiah,2,6,"The queen was sitting beside the king when he asked me, “How long will it take, and when will you be back?” The king agreed to let me go, and I told him when I would return."
Nehemiah,2,7,"Then I asked, “Your Majesty, would you be willing to give me letters to the governors of the provinces west of the River Euphrates, so that I can travel safely to Judah?"
Nehemiah,2,8,"I will need timber to rebuild the gates of the fortress near the temple and more timber to construct the city wall and to build a place for me to live. And so, I would appreciate a letter to Asaph, who is in charge of the royal forest.” God was good to me, and the king did everything I asked."
Nehemiah,2,9,"The king sent some army officers and cavalry troops along with me, and as I travelled through the Western Provinces, I gave the letters to the governors."
Nehemiah,2,10,"But when Sanballat from Horon and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about what had happened, they became very angry, because they didn't want anyone to help the people of Israel."
Nehemiah,2,11,"Three days after arriving in Jerusalem,"
Nehemiah,2,12,"I got up during the night and left my house. I took some men with me, without telling anyone what I thought God wanted me to do for the city. The only animal I took was the donkey I rode on."
Nehemiah,2,13,"I went through Valley Gate on the west, then south past Dragon Spring, before coming to Rubbish Gate. As I rode along, I took a good look at the crumbled walls of the city and the gates that had been torn down and burnt."
Nehemiah,2,14,"On the east side of the city, I headed north to Fountain Gate and King's Pool, but then the path became too narrow for my donkey."
Nehemiah,2,15,So I went down to Kidron Valley and looked at the wall from there. Then before daylight I returned to the city through Valley Gate.
Nehemiah,2,16,"None of the city officials knew what I had in mind. And I had not even told any of the Jews—not the priests, the leaders, the officials, or any other Jews who would be helping in the work."
Nehemiah,2,17,"But when I got back, I said to them, “Jerusalem is truly in a mess! The gates have been torn down and burnt, and everything is in ruins. We must rebuild the city wall so that we can again take pride in our city.”"
Nehemiah,2,18,"Then I told them how kind God had been and what the king had said. Immediately, they replied, “Let's start building now!” So they got everything ready."
Nehemiah,2,19,"When Sanballat, Tobiah, and Geshem the Arab heard about our plans, they started insulting us and saying, “Just look at you! Do you plan to rebuild the walls of the city and rebel against the king?”"
Nehemiah,2,20,"I answered, “We are servants of the God who rules from heaven, and he will make our work succeed. So we will start rebuilding Jerusalem, but you have no right to any of its property, because you have had no part in its history.”"
Nehemiah,3,1,These are the people who helped rebuild the wall and gates of Jerusalem: The high priest Eliashib and the other priests rebuilt Sheep Gate and hung its doors. Then they dedicated Sheep Gate and the section of the wall as far as Hundred Tower and Hananel Tower.
Nehemiah,3,2,"The people of Jericho rebuilt the next section of the wall, and Zaccur son of Imri rebuilt the section after that."
Nehemiah,3,3,"The family of Hassenaah built Fish Gate. They put the beams in place and hung the doors, then they added metal bolts and wooden beams as locks."
Nehemiah,3,4,"Meremoth, son of Uriah and grandson of Hakkoz, completed the next section of the wall. Meshullam, son of Berechiah and grandson of Meshezabel, rebuilt the next section, and Zadok son of Baana rebuilt the section beside that."
Nehemiah,3,5,"The next section was to be repaired by the men of Tekoa, but their town leaders refused to do the hard work they were assigned."
Nehemiah,3,6,"Joiada son of Paseah and Meshullam son of Besodeiah restored Ancient Gate. They put the beams in place, hung the doors, and added metal bolts and wooden beams as locks."
Nehemiah,3,7,"Melatiah from Gibeon, Jadon from Meronoth, and the men from Gibeon and Mizpah rebuilt the next section of the wall. This section reached as far as the house of the governor of West Euphrates Province."
Nehemiah,3,8,"Uzziel son of Harhaiah the goldsmith rebuilt the next section. Hananiah the perfume maker rebuilt the section next after that, and it went as far as Broad Wall."
Nehemiah,3,9,"Rephaiah son of Hur ruled half of the Jerusalem District, and he rebuilt the next section of the wall."
Nehemiah,3,10,"The section after that was close to the home of Jedaiah son of Harumaph, and he rebuilt it. Hattush son of Hashabneiah constructed the next section of the wall."
Nehemiah,3,11,"Malchijah son of Harim and Hasshub son of Pahath Moab rebuilt the section after that, and they also built Oven Tower."
Nehemiah,3,12,"Shallum son of Hallohesh ruled the other half of the Jerusalem District, and he rebuilt the next section of the wall. Shallum's daughters also worked with him."
Nehemiah,3,13,"Hanun and the people who lived in the town of Zanoah rebuilt Valley Gate. They hung the doors and added metal bolts and wooden beams as locks. They also rebuilt the wall for four hundred and forty metres, all the way to Rubbish Gate."
Nehemiah,3,14,"Malchijah son of Rechab ruled the district of Beth-Haccherem, and he rebuilt Rubbish Gate. He hung the doors and added metal bolts and wooden beams as locks."
Nehemiah,3,15,"Shallum son of Colhozeh ruled the district of Mizpah, and he rebuilt Fountain Gate. He put a cover over the gateway, then hung the doors and added metal bolts and wooden beams as locks. He also rebuilt the wall at Shelah Pool. This section was next to the king's garden and went as far as the stairs leading down from David's City."
Nehemiah,3,16,"Nehemiah son of Azbuk ruled half of the district of Beth-Zur, and he rebuilt the next section of the wall. It went as far as the royal cemetery, the artificial pool, and the army barracks."
Nehemiah,3,17,"The Levites who worked on the next sections of the wall were Rehum son of Bani; Hashabiah, who ruled half of the district of Keilah and did this work for his district;"
Nehemiah,3,18,"Binnui son of Henadad, who ruled the other half of the district of Keilah;"
Nehemiah,3,19,"Ezer son of Jeshua, who ruled Mizpah, rebuilt the section of the wall that was in front of the armoury and reached to the corner of the wall;"
Nehemiah,3,20,Baruch son of Zabbai eagerly rebuilt the section of the wall that went all the way to the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest;
Nehemiah,3,21,"Meremoth, son of Uriah and grandson of Hakkoz, built up to the far end of Eliashib's house."
Nehemiah,3,22,Here is a list of the priests who worked on the wall: Priests from the region around Jerusalem rebuilt the next section of the wall.
Nehemiah,3,23,"Benjamin and Hasshub rebuilt the wall in front of their own houses. Azariah, who was the son of Maaseiah and the grandson of Ananiah, rebuilt the section in front of his house."
Nehemiah,3,24,Binnui son of Henadad rebuilt the section of the wall from Azariah's house to the corner of the wall.
Nehemiah,3,25,"Palal son of Uzai rebuilt the next section, which began at the corner of the wall and the tower of the upper palace near the court of the guard. Pedaiah son of Parosh rebuilt the next section of the wall."
Nehemiah,3,26,"He stopped at a place near the Water Gate on the east and the tower guarding the temple. This was close to a section in the city called Ophel, where the temple workers lived."
Nehemiah,3,27,"The men from Tekoa rebuilt the next section of the wall, and it was their second section. It started at a place opposite the large tower that guarded the Temple, and it went all the way to the wall near Ophel."
Nehemiah,3,28,"Some priests rebuilt the next section of the wall. They began working north of Horse Gate, and each one worked on a section in front of his own house."
Nehemiah,3,29,"Zadok son of Immer rebuilt the wall in front of his house. Shemaiah son of Shecaniah, who looked after the East Gate, rebuilt the section after that."
Nehemiah,3,30,"Hananiah and Hanun rebuilt the next section, which was the second section for them. Meshullam son of Berechiah rebuilt the next section, which happened to be in front of his house."
Nehemiah,3,31,"Malchijah, a goldsmith, rebuilt the next section, as far as the house used by the temple workers and merchants. This area was opposite Gathering Gate, near the room on top of the wall at the north-east corner."
Nehemiah,3,32,"The goldsmiths and merchants rebuilt the last section of the wall, which went from the corner room all the way to Sheep Gate."
Nehemiah,4,1,"When Sanballat, the governor of Samaria, heard that we were rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem, he became angry and started insulting our people."
Nehemiah,4,2,"In front of his friends and the Samaritan army he said, “What is this feeble bunch of Jews trying to do? Are they going to rebuild the wall and offer sacrifices all in one day? Do they think they can make something out of this pile of scorched stones?”"
Nehemiah,4,3,"Tobiah from Ammon was standing beside Sanballat and said, “Look at the wall they are building! Why, even a fox could knock over this pile of stones.”"
Nehemiah,4,4,"But I prayed, “Our God, these people hate us and have wished horrible things for us. Please answer our prayers and make their insults fall on them! Let them be the ones to be dragged away as prisoners of war."
Nehemiah,4,5,Don't forgive the mean and evil way they have insulted the builders.”
Nehemiah,4,6,"The people worked hard, and we built the walls of Jerusalem halfway up again."
Nehemiah,4,7,"But Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the people from the city of Ashdod saw the walls going up and the holes being repaired. So they became angry"
Nehemiah,4,8,"and decided to stir up trouble, and to fight against the people of Jerusalem."
Nehemiah,4,9,"But we kept on praying to our God, and we also stationed guards day and night."
Nehemiah,4,10,"Meanwhile, the people of Judah were singing a sorrowful song: “So much rubble for us to haul! Worn out and weary, will we ever finish this wall?”"
Nehemiah,4,11,"Our enemies were saying, “Before those Jews know what has happened, we will sneak up and kill them and put an end to their work.”"
Nehemiah,4,12,"On at least ten different occasions, the Jews living near our enemies warned us against attacks from every side,"
Nehemiah,4,13,"and so I sent people to guard the wall at its lowest places and where there were still holes in it. I placed them according to families, and they stood guard with swords and spears and with bows and arrows."
Nehemiah,4,14,"Then I looked things over and told the leaders, the officials, and the rest of the people, “Don't be afraid of your enemies! The Lord is great and fearsome. So think of him and fight for your relatives and children, your wives and homes!”"
Nehemiah,4,15,"Our enemies found out that we knew about their plot against us, but God kept them from doing what they had planned. So we went back to work on the wall."
Nehemiah,4,16,"From then on, I let half of the young men work while the other half stood guard. They wore armour and had spears and shields, as well as bows and arrows. The leaders helped the workers"
Nehemiah,4,17,who were rebuilding the wall. Everyone who hauled building materials kept one hand free to carry a weapon.
Nehemiah,4,18,Even the workers who were rebuilding the wall strapped on a sword. The worker who was to blow the signal trumpet stayed with me.
Nehemiah,4,19,"I told the people and their officials and leaders, “Our work is so spread out, that we are a long way from one another."
Nehemiah,4,20,"If you hear the sound of the trumpet, come quickly and gather around me. Our God will help us fight.”"
Nehemiah,4,21,"Every day from dawn to dark, half of the workers rebuilt the walls, while the rest stood guard with their spears."
Nehemiah,4,22,I asked the men in charge and their workers to stay inside Jerusalem and stand guard at night. So they guarded the city at night and worked during the day.
Nehemiah,4,23,"I even slept in my work clothes at night; my children, the workers, and the guards slept in theirs as well. And we always kept our weapons close by."
Nehemiah,5,1,Some of the men and their wives complained about the Jews in power
Nehemiah,5,2,"and said, “We have large families, and it takes a lot of grain merely to keep them alive.”"
Nehemiah,5,3,"Others said, “During the famine we even had to mortgage our fields, vineyards, and homes to them in order to buy grain.”"
Nehemiah,5,4,"Then others said, “We had to borrow money from those in power to pay the government tax on our fields and vineyards."
Nehemiah,5,5,"We are Jews just as they are, and our children are as good as theirs. But we still have to sell our children as slaves, and some of our daughters have already been raped. We are completely helpless; our fields and vineyards have even been taken from us.”"
Nehemiah,5,6,"When I heard their complaints and their charges, I became very angry."
Nehemiah,5,7,"So I thought it over and said to the leaders and officials, “How can you charge your own people interest?” Then I called a public meeting and accused the leaders"
Nehemiah,5,8,"by saying, “We have tried to buy back all of our people who were sold into exile. But here you are, selling more of them for us to buy back!” The officials and leaders did not say a word, because they knew this was true."
Nehemiah,5,9,"I continued, “What you have done is wrong! We must honour our God by the way we live, so the Gentiles can't find fault with us."
Nehemiah,5,10,"My relatives, my friends, and I are also lending money and grain, but we must no longer demand payment in return."
Nehemiah,5,11,"Now give back the fields, vineyards, olive orchards, and houses you have taken and also the interest you have been paid.”"
Nehemiah,5,12,"The leaders answered, “We will do whatever you say and return their property, without asking to be repaid.” So I made the leaders promise in front of the priests to give back the property."
Nehemiah,5,13,"Then I emptied my pockets and said, “If you don't keep your promise, that's what God will do to you. He will empty out everything you own, even taking away your houses.” The people answered, “We will keep our promise.” Then they praised the LORD and did as they had promised."
Nehemiah,5,14,"I was governor of Judah from the twentieth year that Artaxerxes was king until the thirty-second year. And during these entire twelve years, my relatives and I refused to accept the food that I was allowed."
Nehemiah,5,15,"Each governor before me had been a burden to the people by making them pay for his food and wine and by demanding forty silver coins a day. Even their officials had been a burden to the people. But I respected God, and I didn't think it was right to be so hard on them."
Nehemiah,5,16,I spent all my time getting the wall rebuilt and did not buy any property. Everyone working for me did the same thing.
Nehemiah,5,17,"I usually fed a hundred and fifty of our own Jewish people and their leaders, as well as foreign visitors from surrounding lands."
Nehemiah,5,18,"Each day one ox, six of the best sheep, and lots of chickens were prepared. Then every ten days, a large supply of wine was brought in. I knew what a heavy burden this would have been for the people, and so I did not ask for my food allowance as governor."
Nehemiah,5,19,I pray that God will bless me for everything I have done for my people.
Nehemiah,6,1,"Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem, and our other enemies learnt that I had completely rebuilt the wall. All I lacked was hanging the doors in the gates."
Nehemiah,6,2,"Then Sanballat and Geshem sent a message, asking me to meet with them in one of the villages in Ono Valley. I knew they were planning to harm me in some way."
Nehemiah,6,3,"So I sent messengers to tell them, “My work is too important to stop now and go there. I can't afford to slow down the work just to visit you.”"
Nehemiah,6,4,"They invited me four times, but each time I refused to go."
Nehemiah,6,5,"Finally, Sanballat sent an official to me with an unsealed letter,"
Nehemiah,6,6,"which said: A rumour is going around among the nations that you and the other Jews are rebuilding the wall and planning to rebel, because you want to be their king. And Geshem says it's true!"
Nehemiah,6,7,"You even have prophets in Jerusalem, claiming you are now the king of Judah. You know the Persian king will hear about this, so let's get together and talk it over."
Nehemiah,6,8,"I sent a message back to Sanballat, saying, “None of this is true! You are making it all up.”"
Nehemiah,6,9,Our enemies were trying to frighten us and to keep us from our work. But I asked God to give me strength.
Nehemiah,6,10,"One day I went to visit Shemaiah. He was looking very worried, and he said, “Let's hurry to the holy place of the temple and hide there. We will lock the temple doors, because your enemies are planning to kill you tonight.”"
Nehemiah,6,11,"I answered, “Why should someone like me have to run and hide in the temple to save my life? I won't go!”"
Nehemiah,6,12,Suddenly I realized that God had not given Shemaiah this message. But Tobiah and Sanballat had paid him to trick me
Nehemiah,6,13,"and to frighten me into doing something wrong, because they wanted to ruin my good name."
Nehemiah,6,14,"Then I asked God to punish Tobiah and Sanballat for what they had done. I prayed that God would punish the prophet Noadiah and the other prophets who, together with her, had tried to frighten me."
Nehemiah,6,15,"On the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul, the wall was completely rebuilt. It had taken fifty-two days."
Nehemiah,6,16,"When our enemies in the surrounding nations learnt that the work was finished, they felt helpless, because they knew that our God had helped us rebuild the wall."
Nehemiah,6,17,All this time the Jewish leaders and Tobiah had been writing letters back and forth.
Nehemiah,6,18,"Many people in Judah were loyal to Tobiah for two reasons: Shecaniah son of Arah was his father-in-law, and Tobiah's son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berechiah."
Nehemiah,6,19,"The people would always tell me about the good things Tobiah had done, and then they would tell Tobiah everything I had said. So Tobiah kept sending letters, trying to frighten me."
Nehemiah,7,1,"After the wall had been rebuilt and the gates hung, then the temple guards, the singers, and the other Levites were assigned their work."
Nehemiah,7,2,"I put my brother Hanani in charge of Jerusalem, along with Hananiah, the commander of the fortress, because Hananiah could be trusted, and he respected God more than most people did."
Nehemiah,7,3,"I said to them, “Don't let the gates to the city be opened until the sun has been up for a while. And make sure that they are closed and barred before the guards go off duty at sunset. Choose people from Jerusalem to stand guard at different places around the wall and others to stand guard near their own houses.”"
Nehemiah,7,4,"Although Jerusalem covered a large area, not many people lived there, and no new houses had been built."
Nehemiah,9,1,"On the twenty-fourth day of the seventh month, the people of Israel went without eating, and they dressed in sackcloth and threw dust on their heads to show their sorrow."
Nehemiah,9,2,"They refused to let foreigners join them, as they met to confess their sins and the sins of their ancestors."
Nehemiah,9,3,"For three hours they stood and listened to the Law of the LORD their God, and then for the next three hours they confessed their sins and worshipped the LORD."
Nehemiah,9,4,"Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani stood on the special platform for the Levites and prayed aloud to the LORD their God."
Nehemiah,9,5,"Then the Levites Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah said: “Stand and shout praises to your LORD, the eternal God! Praise his wonderful name, though he is greater than words can express.”"
Nehemiah,9,6,"You alone are the LORD, Creator of the heavens and all the stars, Creator of the earth and those who live on it, Creator of the ocean and all its creatures. You are the source of life, praised by the stars that fill the heavens."
Nehemiah,9,7,"You are the LORD our God, the one who chose Abram— you brought him from Ur in Babylonia and named him Abraham."
Nehemiah,9,8,"Because he was faithful, you made an agreement to give his descendants the land of the Canaanites and Hittites, of the Amorites and Perizzites, and of the Jebusites and Girgashites. Now you have kept your promise, just as you always do."
Nehemiah,9,9,"When our ancestors were in Egypt, you saw their suffering; when they were at the Red Sea, you heard their cry for help."
Nehemiah,9,10,You knew that the King of Egypt and his officials and his nation had ill-treated your people. So you worked fearsome miracles against the Egyptians and earned a reputation that still remains.
Nehemiah,9,11,"You divided the deep sea, and your people walked through on dry land. But you tossed their enemies in, and they sank down like a heavy stone."
Nehemiah,9,12,"Each day you led your people with a thick cloud, and at night you showed the way with a flaming fire."
Nehemiah,9,13,"At Sinai you came down from heaven, and you gave your people good laws and teachings that are fair and honest."
Nehemiah,9,14,"You commanded them to respect your holy Sabbath, and you instructed your servant Moses to teach them your laws."
Nehemiah,9,15,"When they were hungry, you sent bread from heaven, and when they were thirsty, you let water flow from a rock. Then you commanded them to capture the land that you had solemnly promised."
Nehemiah,10,1,"As governor, I signed the agreement together with Zedekiah and the following priests:"
Nehemiah,11,1,"The nation's leaders and their families settled in Jerusalem. But there was room for only one out of every ten of the remaining families, and so they asked God to show them who would live there."
Nehemiah,11,2,Then everyone else asked God to bless those who were willing to live in Jerusalem.
Nehemiah,11,3,"Some of the people of Israel, the priests, the Levites, the temple workers, and the descendants of Solomon's servants lived on their own property in the towns of Judah. But the leaders of the province lived in Jerusalem with their families."
Nehemiah,12,1,"Many priests and Levites had returned from Babylonia with Zerubbabel and Joshua as their leaders. Those priests were Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,"
Nehemiah,12,2,"Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,"
Nehemiah,12,3,"Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,"
Nehemiah,12,4,"Iddo, Ginnethoi, Abijah,"
Nehemiah,12,5,"Mijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah,"
Nehemiah,12,6,"Shemaiah, Joiarib, Jedaiah,"
Nehemiah,12,7,"Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, and another Jedaiah. These were the leading priests and their assistants during the time of Joshua."
Nehemiah,12,8,"The Levites who returned were Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah. They and their assistants were responsible for the songs of praise,"
Nehemiah,12,9,"while Bakbukiah and Unno, together with their assistants, were responsible for the choral responses."
Nehemiah,12,10,"Joshua was the father of Joiakim, the grandfather of Eliashib, and the great-grandfather of Joiada."
Nehemiah,12,11,Joiada was the father of Jonathan and the grandfather of Jaddua.
Nehemiah,12,12,"When Joiakim was high priest, the following priests were leaders of their clans: Meraiah of the Seraiah clan, Hananiah of Jeremiah,"
Nehemiah,12,13,"Meshullam of Ezra, Jehohanan of Amariah,"
Nehemiah,12,14,"Jonathan of Malluchi, Joseph of Shebaniah,"

Nehemiah,12,20,"Kallai of Sallai, Eber of Amok,"
Nehemiah,12,21,"Hashabiah of Hilkiah, and Nethanel of Jedaiah."
Nehemiah,12,22,"During the time of the high priests Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua, and including the time that Darius was king of Persia, a record was kept of the heads of the Levite and priestly families."
Nehemiah,12,23,"However, no official record was kept of the heads of the Levite clans after the death of Johanan, the grandson of Eliashib."
Nehemiah,12,24,"Hashabiah, Sherebiah, Jeshua son of Kadmiel, and their assistants organized two choirs of Levites to offer praises to God, just as King David, the man of God, had commanded."
Nehemiah,12,25,"Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were responsible for guarding the storerooms near the temple gates."
Nehemiah,12,26,"All these men lived during the time of Joiakim and during the time that I was governor and Ezra, a teacher of the Law of Moses, was priest."
Nehemiah,12,27,"When the city wall was dedicated, Levites from everywhere in Judah were invited to join in the celebration with songs of praise and with the music of cymbals, small harps, and other stringed instruments."
Nehemiah,13,1,"On that day when the Law of Moses was read aloud to everyone, it was discovered that Ammonites and Moabites were forbidden to belong to the people of God."
Nehemiah,13,2,"This was because they had refused to give food and water to Israel and had hired Balaam to call down a curse on them. However, our God turned the curse into a blessing."
Nehemiah,13,3,"Following the reading of the Law of Moses, the people of Israel started sending away anyone who had any foreign ancestors."
Nehemiah,13,4,The priest Eliashib was a relative of Tobiah and had earlier been put in charge of the temple storerooms.
Nehemiah,13,5,"So he let Tobiah live in one of these rooms, where all kinds of things had been stored—the grain offerings, incense, utensils for the temple, as well as the tenth of the grain, wine, and olive oil that had been given for the use of the Levites, singers, and temple guards, and the gifts for the priests."
Nehemiah,13,6,"This happened in the thirty-second year that Artaxerxes ruled Babylonia. I was away from Jerusalem at the time, because I was visiting him. Later I received permission from the king"
Nehemiah,13,7,to return to Jerusalem. Only then did I find out that Eliashib had done this terrible thing of letting Tobiah have a room in the temple.
Nehemiah,13,8,It upset me so much that I threw out every bit of Tobiah's furniture.
Nehemiah,13,9,"Then I ordered the room to be cleaned and the temple utensils, the grain offerings, and the incense to be brought back into the room."
Nehemiah,13,10,"I also found out that the temple singers and several other Levites had returned to work on their farms, because they had not been given their share of the harvest."
Nehemiah,13,11,"I called the leaders together and angrily asked them, “Why is the temple neglected?” Then I told them to start doing their jobs."
Nehemiah,13,12,"After this, everyone in Judah brought a tenth of their grain, wine, and olive oil to the temple storeroom."
Nehemiah,13,13,"Finally, I appointed three men with good reputations to be in charge of what was brought there and to distribute it to the others. They were Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the teacher of the Law, and Pedaiah the Levite. Their assistant was Hanan, the son of Zaccur and the grandson of Mattaniah."
Nehemiah,13,14,I pray that my God will remember these good things that I have done for his temple and for those who worship there.
Nehemiah,13,15,"I also noticed what the people of Judah were doing on the Sabbath. Not only were they trampling grapes to make wine, but they were harvesting their grain, grapes, figs, and other crops, and then loading these on donkeys to sell in Jerusalem. So I warned them not to sell food on the Sabbath."
Nehemiah,13,16,People who had moved to Jerusalem from the city of Tyre were bringing in fish and other things to sell there on the Sabbath.
Nehemiah,13,17,"I got angry and said to the leaders of Judah, “This evil you are doing is an insult to the Sabbath!"
Nehemiah,13,18,"Didn't God punish us and this city because our ancestors did these very same things? And here you are, about to make God furious again by disgracing the Sabbath!”"
Nehemiah,13,19,I ordered the gates of Jerusalem to be closed on the eve of the Sabbath and not to be opened until after the Sabbath had ended. Then I put some of my own men in charge of the gates to make certain that nothing was brought in on the Sabbath.
Nehemiah,13,20,Once or twice some merchants spent the night outside Jerusalem with their goods.
Nehemiah,13,21,"But I warned them, “If you do this again, I'll have you arrested.” From then on, they did not come on the Sabbath."
Nehemiah,13,22,"I ordered the Levites to make themselves holy and to guard the gates on the Sabbath, so that it would be kept holy. God is truly merciful, and I pray that he will treat me with kindness and bless me for doing this."
Nehemiah,13,23,"I discovered that some Jewish men had married women from Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab."
Nehemiah,13,24,About half of their children could not speak Hebrew—they spoke only the language of Ashdod or some other foreign language.
Nehemiah,13,25,"So in my anger, I called down curses on those men. I had them beaten and even pulled out the hair of some of them. Then I made them promise: In the name of God we solemnly promise not to let our sons and daughters marry foreigners."
Nehemiah,13,26,"God dearly loved King Solomon of Israel and made him the greatest king on earth, but Solomon's foreign wives led him into sin."
Nehemiah,13,27,So we will obey you and not rebel against our God by marrying foreign women.
Nehemiah,13,28,"Jehoiada, the son of the high priest Eliashib, had a son who had married a daughter of Sanballat from Horon, and I forced his son to leave."
Nehemiah,13,29,I pray that God will punish them for breaking their priestly vows and disgracing the Levi tribe.
Nehemiah,13,30,"Then I made sure that the people were free from every foreign influence, and I assigned duties for the priests and Levites."
Nehemiah,13,31,I also arranged for the people to bring firewood to the altar each day and for them to bring the first part of their harvest to the temple. I pray that God will bless me for the good I have done.
Esther,2,1,"After a while, King Xerxes got over being angry. But he kept thinking about what Vashti had done and the law that he had written because of her."
Esther,2,2,"Then the king's personal servants said: Your Majesty, a search must be made to find you some beautiful young women."
Esther,2,3,You can select officers in every province to bring them to the place where you keep your wives in the capital city of Susa. Put your servant Hegai in charge of them since that is his job. He can see to it that they are given the proper beauty treatments.
Esther,2,4,"Then let the young woman who pleases you most take Vashti's place as queen. King Xerxes liked these suggestions, and he followed them."
Esther,2,5,"At this time a Jew named Mordecai was living in Susa. His father was Jair, and his grandfather Shimei was the son of Kish from the tribe of Benjamin."
Esther,2,6,"Kish was one of the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had taken from Jerusalem, when he took King Jeconiah of Judah to Babylonia."
Esther,2,7,"Mordecai had a very beautiful cousin named Esther, whose Hebrew name was Hadassah. He had raised her as his own daughter, after her father and mother died."
Esther,2,8,"When the king ordered the search for beautiful women, many were taken to the king's palace in Susa, and Esther was one of them. Hegai was put in charge of all the women,"
Esther,2,9,"and from the first day, Esther was his favourite. He began her beauty treatments at once. He also gave her plenty of food and seven special maids from the king's palace, and they had the best rooms."
Esther,2,10,"Mordecai had warned Esther not to tell anyone that she was a Jew, and she obeyed him."
Esther,2,11,He was anxious to see how Esther was getting on and to learn what had happened to her. So each day he would walk back and forth in front of the court where the women lived.
Esther,2,12,"The young women were given beauty treatments for one whole year. The first six months their skin was rubbed with olive oil and myrrh, and the last six months it was treated with perfumes and cosmetics. Then each of them spent the night alone with King Xerxes."
Esther,2,13,"When a young woman went to the king, she could wear whatever clothes or jewellery she chose from the women's living quarters."
Esther,2,14,"In the evening she would go to the king, and the following morning she would go to the place where his wives stayed after being with him. There a man named Shaashgaz was in charge of the king's wives. Only the ones the king wanted and asked for by name could go back to the king."
Esther,3,1,"Later, King Xerxes promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha to the highest position in his kingdom. Haman was a descendant of Agag,"
Esther,3,2,and the king had given orders for his officials at the royal gate to honour Haman by kneeling down to him. All of them obeyed except Mordecai.
Esther,3,3,"When the other officials asked Mordecai why he disobeyed the king's command,"
Esther,3,4,"he said, “Because I am a Jew.” They spoke to him for several days about kneeling down, but he still refused to obey. Finally, they reported this to Haman, to find out if he would let Mordecai get away with it."
Esther,3,5,Haman was furious to learn that Mordecai refused to kneel down and honour him.
Esther,3,6,"And when he found out that Mordecai was a Jew, he knew that killing only Mordecai was not enough. Every Jew in the whole kingdom had to be killed."
Esther,3,7,"It was now the twelfth year of the rule of King Xerxes. During Nisan, the first month of the year, Haman said, “Find out the best time for me to do this.” The time chosen was Adar, the twelfth month."
Esther,3,8,"Then Haman went to the king and said: Your Majesty, there are some people who live all over your kingdom and won't have a thing to do with anyone else. They have customs that are different from everyone else's, and they refuse to obey your laws. We would be better off to get rid of them!"
Esther,3,9,Why not give orders for all of them to be killed? I can promise that you will get a great deal of silver for your treasury.
Esther,3,10,"The king handed his official ring to Haman, who hated the Jews, and the king told him,"
Esther,3,11,“Do what you want with those people! You can keep their money.”
Esther,3,12,"On the thirteenth day of Nisan, Haman called in the king's secretaries and ordered them to write letters in every language used in the kingdom. The letters were written in the name of the king and sealed by using the king's own ring. At once they were sent to the king's highest officials, the governors of each province, and the leaders of the different nations in the kingdom of Xerxes."
Esther,3,13,"The letters were taken by messengers to every part of the kingdom, and this is what was said in the letters: On the thirteenth day of Adar, the twelfth month, all Jewish men, women, and children are to be killed. And their property is to be taken."
Esther,4,1,"When Mordecai heard about the letter, he tore his clothes in sorrow and put on sackcloth. Then he covered his head with ashes and went through the city, crying and weeping."
Esther,4,2,"But he could go only as far as the palace gate, because no one wearing sackcloth was allowed inside the palace."
Esther,4,3,"In every province where the king's orders were read, the Jews cried and mourned, and they went without eating. Many of them even put on sackcloth and sat in ashes."
Esther,4,4,"When Esther's servant girls and her other servants told her what Mordecai was doing, she became very upset and sent Mordecai some clothes to wear in place of the sackcloth. But he refused to take them."
Esther,4,5,"Esther had a servant named Hathach, who had been given to her by the king. So she called him in and said, “Find out what's wrong with Mordecai and why he's acting this way.”"
Esther,4,6,"Hathach went to Mordecai in the city square in front of the palace gate,"
Esther,4,7,"and Mordecai told him everything that had happened. He also told him how much money Haman had promised to add to the king's treasury, if all the Jews were killed."
Esther,4,8,"Mordecai gave Hathach a copy of the orders for the murder of the Jews and told him that these had been read in Susa. He said, “Show this to Esther and explain what it means. Ask her to go to the king and beg him to have pity on her people, the Jews!”"
Esther,4,9,Hathach went back to Esther and told her what Mordecai had said.
Esther,4,10,"She answered, “Tell Mordecai"
Esther,4,11,"there is a law about going in to see the king, and all his officials and his people know about this law. Anyone who goes in to see the king without being invited by him will be put to death. The only way that anyone can be saved is for the king to hold out the gold sceptre to that person. And it's been thirty days since he has asked for me.”"
Esther,4,12,"When Mordecai was told what Esther had said,"
Esther,4,13,"he sent back this reply, “Don't think that you will escape being killed with the rest of the Jews, just because you live in the king's palace."
Esther,4,14,"If you don't speak up now, we will somehow get help, but you and your family will be killed. It could be that you were made queen for a time like this!”"
Esther,4,15,"Esther sent a message to Mordecai, saying,"
Esther,4,16,"“Bring together all the Jews in Susa and tell them to go without eating for my sake! Don't eat or drink for three days and nights. My servant girls and I will do the same. Then I will go in to see the king, even if it means I must die.”"
Esther,4,17,Mordecai did everything Esther told him to do.
Esther,5,1,"Three days later, Esther dressed in her royal robes and went to the inner court of the palace in front of the throne. The king was sitting there, facing the open doorway."
Esther,5,2,"He was happy to see Esther, and he held out the gold sceptre to her. When Esther came up and touched the tip of the sceptre,"
Esther,5,3,"the king said, “Esther, what brings you here? Just ask, and I will give you as much as half of my kingdom.”"
Esther,5,4,"Esther answered, “Your Majesty, please come with Haman to a dinner I will prepare for you later today.”"
Esther,5,5,"The king said to his servants, “Hurry and get Haman, so we can accept Esther's invitation.” The king and Haman went to Esther's dinner,"
Esther,5,6,"and while they were drinking wine, the king asked her, “What can I do for you? Just ask, and I will give you as much as half of my kingdom.”"
Esther,6,1,"That night the king could not sleep, and he got a servant to read him the records of what had happened since he had been king."
Esther,6,2,"When the servant read how Mordecai had kept Bigthana and Teresh from killing the king,"
Esther,6,3,"the king asked, “What has been done to reward Mordecai for this?” “Nothing, Your Majesty!” the king's servants replied."
Esther,6,4,"About this time, Haman came in to ask the king to have Mordecai hanged on the tower he had built. The king saw him and asked, “Who is that man waiting in front of the throne room?”"
Esther,6,5,"The king's servants answered, “Your Majesty, it is Haman.” “Tell him to come in,” the king commanded."
Esther,6,6,"When Haman entered the room, the king asked him, “What should I do for a man I want to honour?” Haman was sure that he was the one the king wanted to honour."
Esther,6,7,"So he replied, “Your Majesty, if you wish to honour a man,"
Esther,6,8,get someone to bring him one of your own robes and one of your own horses with a fancy head-dress.
Esther,6,9,"Tell one of your highest officials to place your robe on this man and lead him through the streets on your horse, while someone shouts, ‘This is how the king honours a man!’ ”"
Esther,6,10,"The king replied, “Hurry and do just what you have said! Don't forget a thing. Get the robe and the horse for Mordecai the Jew, who is on duty at the palace gate!”"
Esther,6,11,"Haman got the king's robe and put it on Mordecai. He led him through the city on the horse and shouted as he went, “This is how the king honours a man!”"
Esther,6,12,"Afterwards, Mordecai returned to his duties at the palace gate, and Haman hurried home, hiding his face in shame."
Esther,6,13,"Haman told his wife and friends what had happened. Then his wife and his advisers said, “If Mordecai is a Jew, this is just the beginning of your troubles! You will end up a ruined man.”"
Esther,6,14,"They were still talking, when the king's servants came and quickly took Haman to the dinner that Esther had prepared."
Esther,7,1,The king and Haman were dining with Esther
Esther,7,2,"and drinking wine during the second dinner, when the king again said, “Esther, what can I do for you? Just ask, and I will give you as much as half of my kingdom!”"
Esther,7,3,"Esther answered, “Your Majesty, if you really care for me and are willing to help, you can save me and my people. That's what I really want,"
Esther,7,4,"because a reward has been promised to anyone who kills my people. Your Majesty, if we were merely going to be sold as slaves, I would not have bothered you.”"
Esther,7,5,“Who would dare to do such a thing?” the king asked.
Esther,7,6,"Esther replied, “That evil Haman is the one out to get us!” Haman was terrified, as he looked at the king and the queen."
Esther,7,7,"The king was so angry that he got up, left his wine, and went out into the palace garden. Haman realized that the king had already decided what to do with him, and he stayed and begged Esther to save his life."
Esther,7,8,"Just as the king came back into the room, Haman got down on his knees beside Esther, who was lying on the couch. The king shouted, “Now you're even trying to rape my queen here in my own palace!” As soon as the king said this, his servants covered Haman's head."
Esther,7,9,"Then Harbona, one of the king's personal servants, said, “Your Majesty, Haman built a tower twenty-two metres high beside his house, so he could hang Mordecai on it. And Mordecai is the very one who spoke up and saved your life.” “Hang Haman from his own tower!” the king commanded."
Esther,7,10,"Straight away, Haman was hanged on the tower he had built to hang Mordecai, and the king calmed down."
Esther,8,1,"Before the end of the day, King Xerxes gave Esther everything that had belonged to Haman, the enemy of the Jews. Esther told the king that Mordecai was her cousin. So the king made Mordecai one of his highest officials"
Esther,8,2,and gave him the royal ring that Haman had worn. Then Esther put Mordecai in charge of Haman's property.
Esther,8,3,"Once again Esther went to speak to the king. This time she fell down at his feet, crying and begging, “Please stop Haman's evil plan to have the Jews killed!”"
Esther,8,4,"King Xerxes held out the golden sceptre to Esther,"
Esther,8,5,"and she got up and said, “Your Majesty, I know that you will do the right thing and that you really love me. Please stop what Haman has planned. He has already sent letters demanding that the Jews in all your provinces be killed,"
Esther,8,6,and I can't bear to see my people and my own relatives destroyed.”
Esther,8,7,"King Xerxes then said to Esther and Mordecai, “I have already ordered Haman to be hanged and his house given to Esther, because of his evil plans to kill the Jews."
Esther,8,8,"I now give you permission to make a law that will save the lives of your people. You may use my ring to seal the law, so that it can never be changed.”"
Esther,8,9,"On the twenty-third day of Sivan, the third month, the king's secretaries wrote the law. They obeyed Mordecai and wrote to the Jews, the rulers, the governors, and the officials of all one hundred and twenty-seven provinces from India to Ethiopia. The letters were written in every language used in the kingdom, including the Jewish language."
Esther,8,10,They were written in the name of King Xerxes and sealed with his ring. Then they were taken by messengers who rode the king's finest and fastest horses.
Esther,9,1,"The first law that the king had made was to be followed on the thirteenth day of Adar, the twelfth month. This was the very day that the enemies of the Jews had hoped to do away with them. But the Jews turned things around,"
Esther,9,2,"and in the cities of every province they came together to attack their enemies. Everyone was afraid of the Jews, and no one could do anything to oppose them."
Esther,9,3,"The leaders of the provinces, the rulers, the governors, and the court officials were afraid of Mordecai and took sides with the Jews."
Esther,9,4,Everyone in the provinces knew that the king had promoted him and had given him a lot of power.
Esther,9,5,"The Jews took their swords and did away with their enemies, without showing any mercy."
Esther,10,1,"King Xerxes made everyone in his kingdom pay taxes, even those in lands across the sea."
Esther,10,2,All the great and famous things that King Xerxes did are written in the record books of the kings of Media and Persia. These records also tell about the honours that the king gave to Mordecai.
Esther,10,3,"Next to the king himself, Mordecai was the highest official in the kingdom. He was a popular leader of the Jews, because he helped them in many ways and would even speak to the king for them."
Job,1,1,"Many years ago, a man named Job lived in the land of Uz. He was a truly good person, who respected God and refused to do evil."
Job,1,2,Job had seven sons and three daughters.
Job,1,3,"He owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred pair of oxen, five hundred donkeys, and a large number of servants. He was the richest person in the East."
Job,1,4,"Job's sons took turns having feasts in their homes, and they always invited their three sisters to join in the eating and drinking."
Job,1,5,"After each feast, Job would send for his children and perform a ceremony, as a way of asking God to forgive them for any wrongs they might have done. He would get up early the next morning and offer a sacrifice for each of them, just in case they had sinned or silently cursed God."
Job,1,6,"One day, when the angels had gathered around the LORD , and Satan was there with them,"
Job,1,7,"the LORD asked, “Satan, where have you been?” Satan replied, “I have been going all over the earth.”"
Job,1,8,"Then the LORD asked, “What do you think of my servant Job? No one on earth is like him—he is a truly good person, who respects me and refuses to do evil.”"
Job,1,9,“Why shouldn't he respect you?” Satan remarked.
Job,1,10,"“You are like a wall protecting not only him, but his entire family and all his property. You make him successful in whatever he does, and his flocks and herds are everywhere."
Job,1,11,"Try taking away everything he owns, and he will curse you to your face.”"
Job,1,12,"The LORD replied, “All right, Satan, do what you want with anything that belongs to him, but don't harm Job.” Then Satan left."
Job,1,13,"Job's sons and daughters were having a feast in the home of his eldest son,"
Job,1,14,"when someone rushed up to Job and said, “While your servants were ploughing with your oxen, and your donkeys were nearby eating grass,"
Job,1,15,"a gang of Sabeans attacked and stole the oxen and donkeys! Your other servants were killed, and I was the only one who escaped to tell you.”"
Job,1,16,"That servant was still speaking, when a second one came running up and saying, “God sent down a fire that killed your sheep and your servants. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”"
Job,1,17,"Before that servant finished speaking, a third one raced up and said, “Three gangs of Chaldeans attacked and stole your camels! All your other servants were killed, and I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”"
Job,1,18,"That servant was still speaking, when a fourth one dashed up and said, “Your children were having a feast and drinking wine at the home of your eldest son,"
Job,1,19,"when suddenly a storm from the desert blew the house down, crushing all your children. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”"
Job,1,20,"When Job heard this, he tore his clothes and shaved his head because of his great sorrow. He knelt on the ground, then worshipped God"
Job,1,21,and said: “We bring nothing at birth; we take nothing with us at death. The LORD alone gives and takes. Praise the name of the LORD !”
Job,1,22,"In spite of everything, Job did not sin or accuse God of doing wrong."
Job,2,1,"When the angels gathered around the LORD again, Satan was there with them,"
Job,2,2,"and the LORD asked, “Satan, where have you been?” Satan replied, “I have been going all over the earth.”"
Job,2,3,"Then the LORD asked, “What do you think of my servant Job? No one on earth is like him—he is a truly good person, who respects me and refuses to do evil. And he hasn't changed, even though you persuaded me to destroy him for no reason.”"
Job,2,4,"Satan answered, “There's no pain like your own. People will do anything to stay alive."
Job,2,5,"Try striking Job's own body with pain, and he will curse you to your face.”"
Job,2,6,"“All right!” the LORD replied. “Make Job suffer as much as you want, but just don't kill him.”"
Job,2,7,Satan left and caused painful sores to break out all over Job's body—from head to toe.
Job,2,8,"Then Job sat on the ash heap to show his sorrow. And while he was scraping his sores with a broken piece of pottery,"
Job,2,9,"his wife asked, “Why do you still trust God? Why don't you curse him and die?”"
Job,2,10,"Job replied, “Don't talk like a fool! If we accept blessings from God, we must accept trouble as well.” In all that happened, Job never once said anything against God."
Job,2,11,"Eliphaz from Teman, Bildad from Shuah, and Zophar from Naamah were three of Job's friends, and they heard about his troubles. So they agreed to visit Job and comfort him."
Job,2,12,"When they came near enough to see Job, they could hardly recognize him. And in their great sorrow, they tore their clothes, then sprinkled dust on their heads and cried bitterly."
Job,2,13,"For seven days and nights, they sat silently on the ground beside him, because they realized what terrible pain he was in."
Job,3,1,"Finally, Job cursed the day of his birth"
Job,3,2,by saying to God:
Job,3,3,Blot out the day of my birth and the night when my parents created a son.
Job,3,4,"Forget about that day, cover it with darkness,"
Job,3,5,"and send thick, gloomy shadows to fill it with dread."
Job,3,6,Erase that night from the calendar and conceal it with darkness.
Job,3,7,Don't let children be created or joyful shouts be heard ever again in that night.
Job,3,8,Let those with magic powers place a curse on that day.
Job,3,9,"Darken its morning stars and remove all hope of light,"
Job,3,10,because it let me be born into a world of trouble.
Job,3,11,Why didn't I die at birth?
Job,3,12,Why was I accepted and allowed to nurse at my mother's breast?
Job,3,13,Now I would be at peace in the silent world below
Job,3,14,"with kings and their advisers whose palaces lie in ruins,"
Job,3,15,and with rulers once rich with silver and gold.
Job,3,16,"I wish I had been born dead and then buried, never to see the light of day."
Job,3,17,"In the world of the dead, the wicked and the weary rest without a worry."
Job,4,1,Eliphaz from Teman said:
Job,4,2,Please be patient and listen to what I have to say.
Job,5,1,"Job, call out for help and see if an angel comes!"
Job,5,2,Envy and jealousy will kill a stupid fool.
Job,5,3,"I have seen fools take root. But God sends a curse, suddenly uprooting them"
Job,5,4,and leaving their children helpless in court.
Job,5,5,Then hungry and greedy people gobble up their crops and grab their wealth.
Job,5,6,Our suffering isn't caused by the failure of crops;
Job,5,7,"it's all part of life, like sparks shooting skyward."
Job,5,8,"Job, if I were you, I would ask God for help."
Job,5,9,"His miracles are marvellous, more than we can count."
Job,5,10,God sends showers on earth and waters the fields.
Job,5,11,He protects the sorrowful and lifts up those who have been disgraced.
Job,6,1,Job said:
Job,6,2,It's impossible to weigh my misery and grief!
Job,6,3,"They outweigh the sand along the beach, and that's why I have spoken without thinking first."
Job,6,4,The fearsome arrows of God All-Powerful have filled my soul with their poison.
Job,6,5,Do oxen and wild donkeys cry out in distress unless they are hungry?
Job,6,6,What is food without salt? What is more tasteless than the white of an egg?
Job,6,7,"That's how my food tastes, and my appetite is gone."
Job,7,1,Why is life so hard? Why do we suffer?
Job,7,2,We are slaves in search of shade; we are labourers longing for our wages.
Job,7,3,God has made my days drag on and my nights miserable.
Job,7,4,"I pray for night to end, but it stretches out while I toss and turn."
Job,7,5,"My parched skin is covered with worms, dirt, and sores,"
Job,7,6,and my days are running out quicker than the thread of a fast-moving needle.
Job,7,7,"I beg you, God, don't forget! My life is just a breath, and trouble lies ahead."
Job,7,8,"I will vanish from sight, and no one, including you, will ever see me again."
Job,7,9,I will disappear in the grave or vanish from sight like a passing cloud.
Job,7,10,Never will I return home; soon I will be forgotten.
Job,7,11,"And so, I cry out to you in agony and distress."
Job,7,12,Am I the sea or a sea monster? Is that why you imprison me?
Job,7,13,"I go to bed, hoping for rest,"
Job,7,14,but you torture me with terrible dreams.
Job,8,1,Bildad from Shuah said:
Job,8,2,How long will you talk and keep saying nothing?
Job,8,3,Does God All-Powerful stand in the way of justice?
Job,8,4,He made your children pay for their sins.
Job,8,5,So why don't you turn to him
Job,8,6,and start living right? Then he will decide to rescue and restore you to your place of honour.
Job,8,7,Your future will be brighter by far than your past.
Job,8,8,"Our ancestors were wise, so learn from them."
Job,8,9,"Our own time has been short, like a fading shadow, and we know very little."
Job,8,10,But they will instruct you with great understanding.
Job,8,11,"Papyrus reeds grow healthy only in a swamp,"
Job,8,12,"and if the water dries up, they die sooner than grass."
Job,8,13,Such is the hopeless future of all who turn from God
Job,8,14,and trust in something as frail as a spider's web—
Job,8,15,they take hold and fall because it's so flimsy.
Job,8,16,Sinful people are like plants with spreading roots and plenty of sun and water.
Job,8,17,They wrap their roots tightly around rocks.
Job,8,18,"But once they are pulled up, they have no more place;"
Job,8,19,"their life slips away, and other plants grow there."
Job,8,20,We know God doesn't reject an innocent person or help a sinner.
Job,8,21,"And so, he will make you happy and give you something to smile about."
Job,8,22,But your evil enemies will be put to shame and disappear for ever.
Job,9,1,Job said:
Job,9,2,What you say is true. No human is innocent in the sight of God.
Job,9,3,Not once in a thousand times could we win our case if we took him to court.
Job,9,4,God is wise and powerful— who could possibly oppose him and win?
Job,9,5,"When God becomes angry, he can move mountains before they even know it."
Job,9,6,God can shake the earth loose from its foundations
Job,9,7,or command the sun and stars to hold back their light.
Job,9,8,"God alone stretched out the sky, stepped on the sea,"
Job,9,9,"and set the stars in place— the Great Bear and Orion, the Pleiades and the stars in the southern sky."
Job,9,10,"Of all the miracles God works, we cannot understand a single one."
Job,9,11,"God walks right past me, without making a sound."
Job,9,12,"And if he grabs something, who can stop him or raise a question?"
Job,9,13,"When God showed his anger, the servants of the sea monster fell at his feet."
Job,9,14,"How, then, could I possibly argue my case with God?"
Job,9,15,"Even though I am innocent, I can only beg for mercy."
Job,9,16,"And if God came into court when I called him, he would not hear my case."
Job,9,17,He would strike me with a storm and increase my injuries for no reason at all.
Job,9,18,"Before I could get my breath, my miseries would multiply."
Job,9,19,"God is much stronger than I am, and who would call me into court to give me justice?"
Job,9,20,"Even if I were innocent, God would prove me wrong."
Job,9,21,"I am not guilty, but I no longer care what happens to me."
Job,9,22,What difference does it make? God destroys the innocent along with the guilty.
Job,9,23,"When a good person dies a sudden death, God sits back and laughs."
Job,9,24,"And who else but God blindfolds the judges, then lets the wicked take over the earth?"
Job,9,25,"My life is speeding by, without a hope of happiness."
Job,9,26,Each day passes swifter than a sailing ship or an eagle swooping down.
Job,9,27,"Sometimes I try to be cheerful and to stop complaining,"
Job,9,28,"but my sufferings frighten me, because I know that God still considers me guilty."
Job,9,29,So what's the use of trying to prove my innocence?
Job,9,30,"Even if I washed myself with the strongest soap,"
Job,9,31,"God would throw me into a pit of stinking slime, leaving me disgusting to my clothes."
Job,9,32,God isn't a mere human like me. I can't put him on trial.
Job,9,33,Who could possibly judge between the two of us?
Job,9,34,Can someone snatch away the stick God carries to frighten me?
Job,9,35,"Then I could speak up without fear of him, but for now, I cannot speak."
Job,10,1,"I am sick of life! And from my deep despair, I complain to you, my God."
Job,10,2,Don't just condemn me! Point out my sin.
Job,10,3,Why do you take such delight in destroying those you created and in smiling on sinners?
Job,10,4,Do you look at things the way we humans do?
Job,10,5,Is your life as short as ours?
Job,10,6,Is that why you are so quick to find fault with me?
Job,10,7,"You know I am innocent, but who can defend me against you?"
Job,10,8,Will you now destroy someone you created?
Job,10,9,Remember that you moulded me like a piece of clay. So don't turn me back into dust once again.
Job,10,10,"As cheese is made from milk, you created my body from a tiny drop."
Job,10,11,Then you tied my bones together with muscles and covered them with flesh and skin.
Job,10,12,"You, the source of my life, showered me with kindness and watched over me."
Job,10,13,"You have not explained all your mysteries,"
Job,10,14,but you catch and punish me each time I sin.
Job,10,15,"Guilty or innocent, I am condemned and ashamed because of my troubles."
Job,10,16,"No matter how hard I try, you keep hunting me down like a powerful lion."
Job,10,17,You never stop accusing me; you become furious and attack over and over again.
Job,10,18,Why did you let me be born? I would rather have died before birth
Job,10,19,and been carried to the grave without ever breathing.
Job,10,20,"I have only a few days left. Why don't you leave me alone? Let me find some relief,"
Job,11,1,Zophar from Naamah said:
Job,11,2,So much foolish talk cannot go unanswered.
Job,11,3,Your words have silenced others and made them ashamed; now it is only right for you to be put to shame.
Job,11,4,You claim to be innocent and argue that your beliefs are acceptable to God.
Job,11,5,But I wish he would speak
Job,11,6,and let you know that wisdom has many different sides. You would then discover that God has punished you less than you deserve.
Job,11,7,Can you understand the mysteries surrounding God All-Powerful?
Job,11,8,"They are higher than the heavens and deeper than the grave. So what can you do when you know so little,"
Job,11,9,and these mysteries outreach the earth and the sea?
Job,11,10,"If God puts you in prison or drags you to court, what can you do?"
Job,11,11,"God has the wisdom to know when someone is worthless and sinful,"
Job,11,12,but it's easier to tame a wild donkey than to make a fool wise.
Job,11,13,"Surrender your heart to God, turn to him in prayer,"
Job,11,14,and give up your sins— even those you do in secret.
Job,11,15,Then you won't be ashamed; you will be confident and fearless.
Job,11,16,"Your troubles will go away like water beneath a bridge,"
Job,11,17,and your darkest night will be brighter than midday.
Job,11,18,"You will rest safe and secure, filled with hope and emptied of worry."
Job,11,19,You will sleep without fear and be greatly respected.
Job,11,20,But those who are evil will go blind and lose their way. Their only escape is death!
Job,13,1,I know and understand every bit of this.
Job,13,2,None of you are cleverer than I am; there's nothing you know that I don't.
Job,13,3,But I prefer to argue my case with God All-Powerful—
Job,13,4,"you are merely useless doctors, who treat me with lies."
Job,13,5,The wisest thing you can do is to keep quiet
Job,13,6,and listen to my argument.
Job,13,7,Are you telling lies for God
Job,13,8,and not telling the whole truth when you argue his case?
Job,13,9,"If he took you to court, could you fool him, just as you fool others?"
Job,13,10,"If you were secretly unfair, he would correct you,"
Job,13,11,and his glorious splendour would make you terrified.
Job,13,12,Your wisdom and arguments are as delicate as dust.
Job,13,13,"Be quiet while I speak, then say what you will."
Job,13,14,I will be responsible for what happens to me.
Job,13,15,"God may kill me, but still I will trust him and offer my defence."
Job,13,16,"This may be what saves me, because no guilty person would come to his court."
Job,13,17,Listen carefully to my words!
Job,13,18,"I have prepared my case well, and I am certain to win."
Job,13,19,"If you can prove me guilty, I will give up and die."
Job,13,20,"I ask only two things of you, my God, and I will no longer hide from you—"
Job,13,21,stop punishing and terrifying me!
Job,13,22,"Then speak, and I will reply; or else let me speak, and you reply."
Job,13,23,"Please point out my sins, so I will know them."
Job,13,24,Why have you turned your back and count me your enemy?
Job,13,25,Do you really enjoy frightening a fallen leaf?
Job,13,26,Why do you accuse me of horrible crimes and make me pay for sins I did in my youth?
Job,13,27,You have tied my feet down and keep me surrounded;
Job,13,28,I am rotting away like cloth eaten by worms.
Job,14,1,Life is short and sorrowful for every living soul.
Job,14,2,We are flowers that fade and shadows that vanish.
Job,14,3,"And so, I ask you, God, why pick on me?"
Job,14,4,There's no way a human can be completely pure.
Job,14,5,Our time on earth is brief; the number of our days is already decided by you.
Job,14,6,Why don't you leave us alone and let us find some happiness while we toil and labour?
Job,14,7,"When a tree is chopped down, there is always the hope that it will sprout again."
Job,14,8,"Its roots and stump may rot,"
Job,14,9,"but at the touch of water, fresh twigs shoot up."
Job,14,10,"Humans are different— we die, and that's the end."
Job,14,11,We are like streams and lakes after the water has gone;
Job,14,12,"we fall into the sleep of death, never to rise again, until the sky disappears."
Job,14,13,"Please hide me, God, deep in the ground— and when you are angry no more, remember to rescue me."
Job,14,14,Will we humans live again? I would gladly suffer and wait for my time.
Job,14,15,"My Creator, you would want me; you would call out, and I would answer."
Job,14,16,"You would take care of me, but not count my sins—"
Job,14,17,"you would put them in a bag, tie it tight, and toss them away."
Job,14,18,"But in the real world, mountains tumble, and rocks crumble;"
Job,14,19,streams wear away stones and wash away soil. And you destroy our hopes!
Job,14,20,"You change the way we look, then send us away, wiped out for ever."
Job,14,21,We never live to know if our children are praised or disgraced.
Job,14,22,"We feel no pain but our own, and when we mourn, it's only for ourselves."
Job,15,1,Eliphaz from Teman said:
Job,16,1,Job said:
Job,16,2,"I have often heard this, and it offers no comfort."
Job,16,3,So why don't you keep quiet? What's bothering you?
Job,16,4,"If I were in your place, it would be easy to criticize or to give advice."
Job,16,5,But I would offer hope and comfort instead.
Job,16,6,"If I speak, or if I don't, I suffer all the same. My torment continues."
Job,16,7,God has worn me down and destroyed my family;
Job,16,8,my shrivelled up skin proves that I am his prisoner.
Job,16,9,"God is my hateful enemy, glaring at me and attacking with his sharp teeth."
Job,16,10,Everyone is against me; they sneer and slap my face.
Job,16,11,And God is the one who handed me over to this merciless mob.
Job,16,12,"Everything was going well, until God grabbed my neck and shook me to pieces. God set me up as the target"
Job,16,13,"for his arrows, and without showing mercy, he slashed my stomach open, spilling out my insides."
Job,16,14,"God never stops attacking,"
Job,16,15,"and so, in my sorrow I dress in sackcloth and sit in the dust."
Job,16,16,"My face is red with tears, and dark shadows circle my eyes,"
Job,16,17,"though I am not violent, and my prayers are sincere."
Job,16,18,"If I should die, I beg the earth not to cover my cry for justice."
Job,16,19,"Even now, God in heaven is both my witness and my protector."
Job,16,20,"My friends have rejected me, but God is the one I beg"
Job,16,21,"to show that I am right, just as a friend should."
Job,16,22,"Because in only a few years, I will be dead and gone."
Job,17,1,"My hopes have died, my time is up, and the grave is ready."
Job,17,2,"All I can see are angry crowds, making fun of me."
Job,17,3,"If you, LORD , don't help, who will pay the price for my release?"
Job,17,4,"My friends won't really listen, all because of you, and so you must be the one to prove them wrong."
Job,17,5,"They have condemned me, just to benefit themselves; now blind their children."
Job,17,6,"You, God, are the reason I am insulted and spat on."
Job,17,7,I am almost blind with grief; my body is a mere shadow.
Job,17,8,"People who are truly good would feel so alarmed, that they would become angry with my worthless friends."
Job,17,9,"They would do the right thing and because they did, they would grow stronger."
Job,17,10,But none of my friends show any sense.
Job,17,11,My life is drawing to an end; hope has disappeared.
Job,17,12,But all my friends can do is offer empty hopes.
Job,17,13,I could tell the world below to prepare me a bed.
Job,17,14,"Then I could greet the grave as my father and say to the worms, “Hello, mother and sisters!”"
Job,17,15,But what kind of hope is that?
Job,17,16,Will it keep me company in the world of the dead?
Job,18,1,Bildad from Shuah said:
Job,18,2,How long will you talk? Be sensible! Let us speak.
Job,18,3,Or do you think that we are dumb animals?
Job,18,4,You cut yourself in anger. Will that shake the earth or even move the rocks?
Job,19,1,Job said:
Job,19,2,How long will you torture me with your words?
Job,19,3,Isn't ten times enough for you to accuse me? Aren't you ashamed?
Job,19,4,"Even if I have sinned, you haven't been harmed."
Job,19,5,"You boast of your goodness, claiming I am suffering because I am guilty."
Job,19,6,But God is the one at fault for finding fault with me.
Job,19,7,"Though I pray to be rescued from this torment, no whisper of justice answers me."
Job,19,8,God has me trapped with a wall of darkness
Job,19,9,and stripped of respect.
Job,19,10,"God rips me apart, uproots my hopes,"
Job,19,11,"and attacks with fierce anger, as though I were his enemy."
Job,19,12,"His entire army advances, then surrounds my tent."
Job,20,1,Zophar from Naamah said:
Job,20,2,Your words are disturbing; now I must speak.
Job,20,3,"You have accused and insulted me, and reason requires a reply."
Job,20,4,"Since the time of creation, everyone has known"
Job,20,5,that sinful people are happy for only a while.
Job,20,6,"Though their pride and power may reach to the sky,"
Job,20,7,"they will disappear like dust, and those who knew them will wonder what happened."
Job,20,8,They will be forgotten like a dream
Job,20,9,and vanish from the sight of family and friends.
Job,20,10,Their children will have to repay what the parents took from the poor.
Job,20,11,"Indeed, the wicked will die and go to their graves in the prime of life."
Job,20,12,Sinners love the taste of sin; they relish every bite
Job,20,13,and swallow it slowly.
Job,20,14,But their food will turn sour and poison their stomachs.
Job,20,15,Then God will make them lose the wealth they gobbled up.
Job,20,16,They will die from the fangs of poisonous snakes
Job,20,17,and never enjoy rivers flowing with milk and honey.
Job,20,18,"Their hard work will result in nothing gained,"
Job,20,19,because they cheated the poor and took their homes.
Job,20,20,Greedy people want everything and are never satisfied.
Job,20,21,"But when nothing remains for them to grab, they will be nothing."
Job,20,22,"Once they have everything, distress and despair will strike them down,"
Job,20,23,and God will make them swallow his blazing anger.
Job,20,24,"While running from iron spears, they will be killed by arrows of bronze,"
Job,20,25,"whose shining tips go straight through their bodies. They will be trapped by terror,"
Job,20,26,and what they treasure most will be lost in the dark. God will send flames to destroy them in their tents with all their property.
Job,20,27,"The heavens and the earth will testify against them,"
Job,20,28,and all their possessions will be dragged off when God becomes angry.
Job,20,29,This is what God has decided for those who are evil.
Job,21,1,Job said:
Job,21,2,"If you want to offer comfort, then listen to me."
Job,21,3,"And when I have finished, you can start your insults all over again."
Job,21,4,My complaint is against God; that's why I am impatient.
Job,21,5,"Just looking at me is enough to make you sick,"
Job,21,6,and the very thought of myself fills me with disgust.
Job,21,7,Why do evil people live so long and gain such power?
Job,21,8,Why are they allowed to see their children grow up?
Job,21,9,"They have no worries at home, and God never punishes them."
Job,21,10,Their cattle have lots of calves without ever losing one;
Job,21,11,their children play and dance safely by themselves.
Job,21,12,"These people sing and celebrate to the sound of tambourines, small harps, and flutes,"
Job,21,13,"and they are successful, without a worry, until the day they die."
Job,21,14,"Those who are evil say to God All-Powerful, “Leave us alone! Don't bother us with your teachings."
Job,21,15,What do we gain from praying and worshipping you?
Job,21,16,"We succeeded all on our own.” And so, I keep away from them and their evil schemes."
Job,21,17,How often does God become angry and send disaster and darkness to punish sinners?
Job,21,18,How often does he strike them like a storm that scatters straw?
Job,21,19,"You say, “God will punish those sinners' children in place of those sinners.” But I say, “Let him punish those sinners themselves until they really feel it."
Job,21,20,Let God All-Powerful force them to drink their own destruction from the cup of his anger.
Job,21,21,"Because after they are dead, they won't care what happens to their children.”"
Job,21,22,Who can tell God what to do? He judges powerful rulers.
Job,22,1,Eliphaz from Teman said:
Job,22,2,"What use are we humans to God, even the wisest of us?"
Job,22,3,"If you were completely sinless, that would still mean nothing to God All-Powerful."
Job,22,4,Is he correcting you for worshipping him?
Job,22,5,No! It's because of your terrible sins.
Job,22,6,"To guarantee payment of a debt, you have taken clothes from the poor."
Job,22,7,"And you refused bread and water to the hungry and thirsty,"
Job,22,8,"although you were rich, respected, and powerful."
Job,22,9,You have turned away widows and have broken the arms of orphans.
Job,22,10,"That's why you were suddenly trapped by terror,"
Job,22,11,"blinded by darkness, and drowned in a flood."
Job,22,12,"God lives in the heavens above the highest stars, where he sees everything."
Job,22,13,Do you think the deep darkness hides you from God?
Job,22,14,"Do thick clouds cover his eyes, as he walks around heaven's dome high above the earth?"
Job,22,15,"Give up those ancient ideas believed by sinners,"
Job,22,16,who were swept away without warning.
Job,22,17,"They rejected God All-Powerful, feeling he was helpless,"
Job,22,18,although he had been kind to their families. The beliefs of these sinners are truly disgusting.
Job,22,19,"When God's people see the godless swept away, they celebrate,"
Job,22,20,"saying, “Our enemies are gone, and fire has destroyed their possessions.”"
Job,22,21,Surrender to God All-Powerful! You will find peace and prosperity.
Job,22,22,Listen to his teachings and take them to heart.
Job,22,23,"If you return to God and turn from sin, all will go well for you."
Job,22,24,"So get rid of your finest gold, as though it were sand."
Job,22,25,"Let God All-Powerful be your silver and gold,"
Job,22,26,and you will find happiness by worshipping him.
Job,22,27,"God will answer your prayers, and you will keep the promises you made to him."
Job,22,28,"He will do whatever you ask, and life will be bright."
Job,22,29,"When others are disgraced, God will clear their names in answer to your prayers."
Job,22,30,"Even those who are guilty will be forgiven, because you obey God."
Job,23,1,Job said:
Job,23,2,"Today I complain bitterly, because God has been cruel and made me suffer."
Job,23,3,"If I knew where to find God, I would go there"
Job,23,4,and argue my case.
Job,23,5,Then I would discover what he wanted to say.
Job,23,6,Would he overwhelm me with his greatness? No! He would listen
Job,23,7,"because I am innocent, and he would say, “I now set you free!”"
Job,23,8,"I cannot find God anywhere— in front of or behind me,"
Job,23,9,"to my left or my right. God is always at work, though I never see him."
Job,23,10,"But he knows what I am doing, and when he tests me, I will be pure as gold."
Job,24,1,Why doesn't God set a time for court? Why don't his people know where he can be found?
Job,24,2,Sinners remove boundary markers and take care of sheep they have stolen.
Job,24,3,They cheat orphans and widows by taking their donkeys and oxen.
Job,24,4,The poor are trampled and forced to hide
Job,24,5,"in the desert, where they and their children must live like wild donkeys and search for food."
Job,24,6,"If they want grain or grapes, they must go to the property of these sinners."
Job,24,7,"They sleep naked in the cold, because they have no cover,"
Job,24,8,and during a storm their only shelters are caves among the rocky cliffs.
Job,24,9,Children whose fathers have died are taken from their mothers as payment for a debt.
Job,24,10,"Then they are forced to work naked in the grain fields because they have no clothes, and they go hungry."
Job,24,11,They crush olives to make oil and grapes to make wine— but still they go thirsty.
Job,24,12,"And along the city streets, the wounded and dying cry out, yet God does nothing."
Job,24,13,Some rebel and refuse to follow the light.
Job,24,14,"Soon after sunset they murder the poor and the needy, and at night they steal."
Job,24,15,"Others wait for the dark, thinking they won't be seen if they sleep with the wife or husband of someone else."
Job,24,16,"Robbers hide during the day, then break in after dark because they reject the light."
Job,24,17,"They prefer night to day, since the terrors of the night are their friends."
Job,24,18,"Those sinners are filthy foam on the surface of the water. And so, their fields and vineyards will fall under a curse and won't produce."
Job,24,19,"Just as the heat of summer swallows the snow, the world of the dead swallows those who sin."
Job,24,20,"Forgotten here on earth, and with their power broken, they taste sweet to worms."
Job,24,21,Sinners take advantage of widows and other helpless women.
Job,24,22,"But God's mighty strength destroys those in power. Even if they seem successful, they are doomed to fail."
Job,24,23,"God may let them feel secure, but they are never out of his sight."
Job,24,24,"Great for a while; gone for ever! Sinners are mowed down like weeds, then they wither and die."
Job,24,25,"If I haven't spoken the truth, then prove me wrong."
Job,25,1,Bildad from Shuah said:
Job,25,2,"God is the one to fear, because God is in control and rules the heavens."
Job,25,3,Who can count his army of stars? Isn't God the source of light?
Job,25,4,How can anyone be innocent in the sight of God?
Job,25,5,"To him, not even the light of the moon and stars can ever be pure."
Job,25,6,"So how can we humans, when we are merely worms?"
Job,26,1,Job said:
Job,26,2,You have really been helpful to someone weak and weary.
Job,26,3,You have given great advice and wonderful wisdom to someone truly in need.
Job,26,4,How can anyone possibly speak with such understanding?
Job,26,5,Remember the terrible trembling of those in the world of the dead below the mighty ocean.
Job,26,6,"Nothing in that land of death and destruction is hidden from God,"
Job,26,7,who hung the northern sky and suspended the earth on empty space.
Job,26,8,"God stores water in clouds, but they don't burst,"
Job,26,9,and he wraps them around the face of the moon.
Job,26,10,"On the surface of the sea, God has drawn a boundary line between light and darkness."
Job,26,11,And columns supporting the sky tremble at his command.
Job,26,12,"By his power and wisdom, God conquered the force of the mighty ocean."
Job,26,13,"The heavens became bright when he breathed, and the escaping sea monster died at the hands of God."
Job,26,14,These things are merely a whisper of God's power at work. How little we would understand if this whisper ever turned into thunder!
Job,27,1,Job said:
Job,27,2,"I am desperate because God All-Powerful refuses to do what is right. As surely as God lives,"
Job,27,3,"and while he gives me breath,"
Job,27,4,I will tell only the truth.
Job,27,5,"Until the day I die, I will refuse to do wrong by saying you are right,"
Job,27,6,because each day my conscience agrees that I am innocent.
Job,27,7,I pray that my enemies will suffer no less than the wicked.
Job,27,8,"Such people are hopeless, and God All-Powerful will cut them down,"
Job,27,9,without listening when they beg for mercy.
Job,27,10,"And that is what God should do, because they don't like him or ever pray."
Job,27,11,Now I will explain in detail what God All-Powerful does.
Job,27,12,All of you have seen these things for yourselves. So you have no excuse.
Job,27,13,Here is how God All-Powerful treats those who are wicked and brutal.
Job,27,14,"They may have many children, but most of them will go hungry or suffer a violent death."
Job,27,15,"Others will die of disease, and their widows won't be able to weep."
Job,27,16,The wicked may collect riches and clothes in abundance as easily as clay.
Job,27,17,But God's people will wear clothes taken from them and divide up their riches.
Job,27,18,No homes built by the wicked will outlast a cocoon or a shack.
Job,27,19,"Those sinners may go to bed rich, but they will wake up poor."
Job,27,20,Terror will strike at night like a flood or a storm.
Job,27,21,Then a scorching wind will sweep them away
Job,27,22,"without showing mercy, as they try to escape."
Job,27,23,"At last, the wind will celebrate because they are gone."
Job,28,1,"Gold and silver are mined, then purified;"
Job,28,2,the same is done with iron and copper.
Job,28,3,Miners carry lanterns deep into the darkness to search for these metals.
Job,28,4,"They dig tunnels in distant, unknown places, where they dangle by ropes."
Job,28,5,"Far beneath the grain fields, fires are built to break loose those rocks"
Job,28,6,that have jewels or gold.
Job,28,7,Miners go to places unseen by the eyes of hawks;
Job,28,8,they walk on soil unknown to the proudest lions.
Job,28,9,With their own hands they remove sharp rocks and uproot mountains.
Job,28,10,They dig through the rocks in search of jewels and precious metals.
Job,28,11,They also uncover the sources of rivers and discover secret places.
Job,28,12,But where is wisdom found?
Job,28,13,No human knows the way.
Job,28,14,Nor can it be discovered in the deepest sea.
Job,29,1,Job said:
Job,29,2,"I long for the past, when God took care of me,"
Job,29,3,and the light from his lamp showed me the way through the dark.
Job,29,4,"I was in the prime of life, God All-Powerful was my closest friend,"
Job,29,5,and all my children were nearby.
Job,29,6,"My herds gave enough milk to bathe my feet, and from my olive harvest flowed rivers of oil."
Job,30,1,"Young people now insult me, although their fathers would have been a disgrace to my sheep dogs."
Job,30,2,And those who insult me are helpless themselves.
Job,30,3,They must claw the desert sand in the dark for something to satisfy their hunger.
Job,30,4,"They gather tasteless shrubs for food and firewood,"
Job,30,5,"and they are driven out of towns, as though they were thieves."
Job,30,6,"Their only homes are ditches or holes between rocks,"
Job,30,7,where they bray like donkeys gathering around shrubs.
Job,30,8,And like senseless donkeys they are chased away.
Job,30,9,Those worthless nobodies make up jokes and songs to disgrace me.
Job,30,10,"They are hateful and keep their distance, even while spitting in my direction."
Job,30,11,"God has destroyed me, and so they don't care what they do."
Job,30,12,"Their attacks never stop, though I am defenceless, and my feet are trapped."
Job,30,13,"Without any help, they prevent my escape, destroying me completely"
Job,30,14,and leaving me crushed.
Job,30,15,Terror has me surrounded; my reputation and my riches have vanished like a cloud.
Job,30,16,I am sick at heart! Pain has taken its toll.
Job,30,17,"Night chews on my bones, causing endless torment,"
Job,30,18,"and God has shrunk my skin, choking me to death."
Job,30,19,I have been thrown in the dirt and now am dirt myself.
Job,30,20,"I beg God for help, but there is no answer; and when I stand up, he simply stares."
Job,30,21,"God has turned brutal,"
Job,30,22,stirring up a storm to toss me about.
Job,30,23,"Soon he will send me home to the world of the dead, where we all must go."
Job,30,24,"No one refuses help to others, when disaster strikes."
Job,30,25,I mourned for the poor and those who suffered.
Job,30,26,"But when I beg for relief and light, all I receive are disaster and darkness."
Job,30,27,My stomach is tied in knots; pain is my daily companion.
Job,30,28,"Suffering has scorched my skin, and in the city council I stand and cry out,"
Job,30,29,making mournful sounds like jackals and owls.
Job,30,30,"My skin is so parched, that it peels right off, and my bones are burning."
Job,30,31,My only songs are sorrow and sadness.
Job,31,1,I promised myself never to stare with desire at a young woman.
Job,31,2,God All-Powerful punishes men who do that.
Job,31,3,"In fact, God sends disaster on all who sin,"
Job,31,4,and he keeps a close watch on everything I do.
Job,31,5,"I am not dishonest or deceitful,"
Job,31,6,and I beg God to prove my innocence.
Job,31,7,"If I have disobeyed him or even wanted to,"
Job,31,8,then others can eat my harvest and uproot my crops.
Job,31,9,"If I have desired someone's wife and chased after her,"
Job,31,10,then let some stranger steal my wife from me.
Job,31,11,"If I took someone's wife, it would be a horrible crime,"
Job,31,12,sending me to destruction and my crops to the flames.
Job,31,13,"When my servants complained against me, I was fair to them."
Job,31,14,"Otherwise, what answer would I give to God when he judges me?"
Job,31,15,"After all, God is the one who gave life to each of us before we were born."
Job,31,16,"I have never cheated widows or others in need,"
Job,31,17,and I have always shared my food with orphans.
Job,31,18,"Since the time I was young, I have cared for orphans and helped widows."
Job,31,19,"I provided clothes for the poor,"
Job,31,20,and I was praised for supplying woollen garments to keep them warm.
Job,31,21,"If I have ever raised my arm to threaten an orphan when the power was mine,"
Job,31,22,I hope that arm will fall from its socket.
Job,31,23,I could not have been abusive; I was terrified at the thought that God might punish me.
Job,31,24,"I have never trusted the power of wealth,"
Job,31,25,or taken pride in owning many possessions.
Job,32,1,"Finally, these three men stopped arguing with Job, because he refused to admit that he was guilty."
Job,32,2,"Elihu from Buz was there, and he had become upset with Job for blaming God instead of himself."
Job,32,3,He was also angry with Job's three friends for not being able to prove that Job was wrong.
Job,32,4,"Elihu was younger than these three, and he let them speak first."
Job,32,5,"But he became irritated when they could not answer Job,"
Job,32,6,"and he said to them: I am much younger than you, so I have shown respect by keeping silent."
Job,32,7,I once believed age was the source of wisdom;
Job,32,8,now I truly realize wisdom comes from God.
Job,32,9,Age is no guarantee of wisdom and understanding.
Job,32,10,That's why I ask you to listen to me.
Job,33,1,"Job, listen to me! Pay close attention."
Job,34,1,Elihu said:
Job,34,2,"You men think you are wise, but just listen to me!"
Job,34,3,"Think about my words, as you would taste food."
Job,34,4,Then we can decide the case and give a just verdict.
Job,34,5,Job claims he is innocent and God is guilty of ill-treating him.
Job,34,6,Job also argues that God considers him a liar and that he is suffering severely in spite of his innocence.
Job,34,7,"But to tell the truth, Job is shameless!"
Job,34,8,"He spends his time with sinners,"
Job,34,9,"because he has said, “It doesn't pay to please God.”"
Job,34,10,"If any of you are clever, you will listen and learn that God All-Powerful does what is right."
Job,34,11,"God always treats everyone the way they deserve,"
Job,34,12,and he is never unfair.
Job,34,13,"From the very beginning, God has been in control of all the world."
Job,34,14,"If God took back the breath that he breathed into us,"
Job,34,15,we humans would die and return to the soil.
Job,34,16,So be wise and listen!
Job,34,17,"The mighty God is the one who brings about justice, and you are condemning him."
Job,34,18,"Indeed, God is the one who condemns unfair rulers."
Job,34,19,"And God created us all; he has no favourites, whether rich or poor."
Job,34,20,"Even powerful rulers die in the darkness of night when they least expect it, just like the rest of us."
Job,34,21,God watches everything we do.
Job,34,22,No evil person can hide in the deepest darkness.
Job,34,23,"And so, God doesn't need to set a time for judgment."
Job,34,24,"Without asking for advice, God removes mighty leaders and puts others in their place."
Job,34,25,"He knows what they are like, and he wipes them out in the middle of the night."
Job,34,26,"And while others look on, he punishes them because they were evil"
Job,34,27,and refused to obey him.
Job,34,28,"The persons they ill-treated had prayed for help, until God answered their prayers."
Job,34,29,"When God does nothing, can any person or nation find fault with him?"
Job,34,30,"But still, he punishes rulers who abuse their people."
Job,34,31,"Job, you should tell God that you are guilty and promise to do better."
Job,34,32,"Then ask him to point out what you did wrong, so you won't do it again."
Job,34,33,"Do you make the rules, or does God? You have to decide— I can't do it for you; now make up your mind."
Job,34,34,"Job, anyone with good sense can easily see"
Job,34,35,that you are speaking nonsense and lack good judgment.
Job,34,36,So I pray for you to suffer as much as possible for talking like a sinner.
Job,34,37,"You have rebelled against God, time after time, and have even insulted us."
Job,35,1,Elihu said:
Job,35,2,"Job, are you really innocent in the sight of God?"
Job,35,3,Don't you honestly believe it pays to obey him?
Job,35,4,I will give the answers to you and your friends.
Job,36,1,Elihu said:
Job,36,2,Be patient a while longer; I have something else to say in God's defence.
Job,36,3,God always does right— and this knowledge comes straight from God.
Job,36,4,You can rest assured that what I say is true.
Job,36,5,"Although God is mighty, he cares about everyone and makes fair decisions."
Job,36,6,"The wicked are cut down, and those who are wronged receive justice."
Job,36,7,God watches over good people and places them in positions of power and honour for ever.
Job,36,8,"But when people are prisoners of suffering and pain,"
Job,37,1,"I am frightened and tremble all over,"
Job,37,2,"when I hear the roaring voice of God in the thunder,"
Job,37,3,and when I see his lightning flash across the sky.
Job,37,4,"God's majestic voice thunders his commands,"
Job,37,5,creating miracles too marvellous for us to understand.
Job,37,6,Snow and heavy rainstorms
Job,37,7,"make us stop and think about God's power,"
Job,37,8,and they force animals to seek shelter.
Job,37,9,"The storms of winter strike,"
Job,37,10,and the breath of God freezes streams and rivers.
Job,37,11,"Rain clouds filled with lightning appear at God's command,"
Job,37,12,travelling across the sky
Job,37,13,"to release their cargo— sometimes as punishment for sin, sometimes as kindness."
Job,37,14,"Job, consider carefully the many wonders of God."
Job,37,15,Can you explain why lightning flashes at the orders
Job,37,16,of God who knows all things? Or how he hangs the clouds in empty space?
Job,37,17,You almost melt in the heat of fierce desert winds when the sky is like brass.
Job,37,18,"God can spread out the clouds to get relief from the heat, but can you?"
Job,37,19,"Tell us what to say to God! Our minds are in the dark, and we don't know how to argue our case."
Job,37,20,Should I risk my life by telling God that I want to speak?
Job,37,21,No one can stare at the sun after a breeze has blown the clouds from the sky.
Job,37,22,Yet the glorious splendour of God All-Powerful is brighter by far.
Job,37,23,"God cannot be seen— but his power is great, and he is always fair."
Job,37,24,"And so we humans fear God, because he shows no respect for those who are proud and think they know so much."
Job,38,1,"From out of a storm, the LORD said to Job:"
Job,38,2,Why do you talk so much when you know so little?
Job,38,3,Now get ready to face me! Can you answer the questions I ask?
Job,38,4,How did I lay the foundation for the earth? Were you there?
Job,38,5,Doubtless you know who decided its length and width.
Job,38,6,"What supports the foundation? Who placed the cornerstone,"
Job,38,7,"while morning stars sang, and angels rejoiced?"
Job,38,8,"When the ocean was born, I set its boundaries"
Job,38,9,and wrapped it in blankets of thickest fog.
Job,38,10,"Then I built a wall around it, locked the gates,"
Job,38,11,"and said, “Your powerful waves stop here! They can go no further.”"
Job,38,12,Did you ever tell the sun to rise? And did it obey?
Job,38,13,Did it take hold of the earth and shake out the wicked like dust from a rug?
Job,38,14,Early dawn outlines the hills like stitches on clothing or sketches on clay.
Job,38,15,"But its light is too much for those who are evil, and their power is broken."
Job,38,16,"Job, have you ever walked on the ocean floor?"
Job,38,17,Have you seen the gate to the world of the dead?
Job,38,18,"And how large is the earth? Tell me, if you know!"
Job,38,19,"Where is the home of light, and where does darkness live?"
Job,38,20,Can you lead them home?
Job,38,21,"I'm certain you must be able to, since you were already born when I created everything."
Job,38,22,"Have you been to the places where I keep snow and hail,"
Job,38,23,until I use them to punish and conquer nations?
Job,38,24,"From where does lightning leap, or the east wind blow?"
Job,38,25,Who carves out a path for thunderstorms? Who sends torrents of rain
Job,38,26,on empty deserts where no one lives?
Job,38,27,Rain that changes barren land to meadows green with grass.
Job,38,28,Who is the father of the dew and of the rain?
Job,38,29,Who gives birth to the sleet and the frost
Job,38,30,"that fall in winter, when streams and lakes freeze solid as a rock?"
Job,38,31,Can you arrange stars in groups such as Orion and the Pleiades?
Job,38,32,Do you control the stars or set in place the Great Bear and the Little Bear?
Job,38,33,"Do you know the laws that govern the heavens, and can you make them rule the earth?"
Job,38,34,"Can you order the clouds to send a downpour,"
Job,38,35,or will lightning flash at your command?
Job,38,36,Did you teach birds to know that rain or floods are on their way?
Job,38,37,Can you count the clouds or pour out their water
Job,38,38,"on the dry, lumpy soil?"
Job,38,39,"When lions are hungry, do you help them hunt?"
Job,38,40,Do you send an animal into their den?
Job,38,41,"And when starving young ravens cry out to me for food, do you satisfy their hunger?"
Job,39,1,When do mountain goats and deer give birth? Have you been there when their young are born?
Job,41,1,Can you catch a sea monster by using a fish-hook? Can you tie its mouth shut with a rope?
Job,41,2,Can it be led around by a ring in its nose or a hook in its jaw?
Job,41,3,Will it beg for mercy?
Job,41,4,Will it surrender as a slave for life?
Job,41,5,Can it be tied by the leg like a pet bird for little girls?
Job,41,6,Is it ever chopped up and its pieces bargained for in the fish-market?
Job,41,7,Can it be killed with harpoons or spears?
Job,41,8,Wrestle with it just once— that will be the end.
Job,41,9,Merely a glimpse of this monster makes all courage melt.
Job,41,10,"And if it is too fierce for anyone to attack, who would dare oppose me?"
Job,41,11,I am in command of the world and in debt to no one.
Job,41,12,"What powerful legs, what a stout body this monster possesses!"
Job,41,13,Who could strip off its armour or bring it under control with a harness?
Job,41,14,"Who would try to open its jaws, full of fearsome teeth?"
Job,42,1,Job said:
Job,42,2,"No one can oppose you, because you have the power to do what you want."
Job,42,3,You asked why I talk so much when I know so little. I have talked about things that are far beyond my understanding.
Job,42,4,You told me to listen and answer your questions.
Job,42,5,I heard about you from others; now I have seen you with my own eyes.
Job,42,6,That's why I hate myself and sit here in dust and ashes to show my sorrow.
Job,42,7,"The LORD said to Eliphaz: What my servant Job has said about me is true, but I am angry with you and your two friends for not telling the truth."
Job,42,8,"So I want you to go over to Job and offer seven bulls and seven goats on an altar as a sacrifice to please me. After this, Job will pray, and I will agree not to punish you for your foolishness."
Job,42,9,"Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar obeyed the LORD , and he answered Job's prayer."
Job,42,10,"After Job had prayed for his three friends, the LORD made Job twice as rich as he had been before."
Job,42,11,"Then Job gave a feast for his brothers and sisters and for his old friends. They expressed their sorrow for the suffering the LORD had brought on him, and they each gave Job some silver and a gold ring."
Job,42,12,"The LORD now blessed Job more than ever; he gave him fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand pair of oxen, and a thousand donkeys."
Job,42,13,"In addition to seven sons, Job had three daughters,"
Job,42,14,"whose names were Jemimah, Keziah, and Keren Happuch."
Job,42,15,"They were the most beautiful women in that part of the world, and Job gave them shares of his property, along with their brothers."
Job,42,16,Job lived for another one hundred and forty years—long enough to see his great-grandchildren have children of their own—
Job,42,17,"and when he finally died, he was very old."

Ecclesiastes,2,18,"Suddenly I realized that others would some day get everything I had worked so hard for, then I started hating it all."
Ecclesiastes,2,19,"Who knows if those people will be sensible or stupid? Either way, they will own everything I have earned by hard work and wisdom. It doesn't make sense."
Ecclesiastes,2,20,"I thought about all my hard work, and I felt depressed."
Ecclesiastes,2,21,"When we use our wisdom, knowledge, and skill to get what we own, why do we have to leave it to someone who didn't work for it? This is senseless and wrong."
Ecclesiastes,2,22,What do we really gain from all our hard work?
Ecclesiastes,2,23,"Our bodies ache during the day, and work is torture. Then at night our thoughts are troubled. It just doesn't make sense."
Ecclesiastes,2,24,"The best thing we can do is to enjoy eating, drinking, and working. I believe these are God's gifts to us,"
Ecclesiastes,2,25,and no one enjoys eating and living more than I do.
Ecclesiastes,2,26,"If we please God, he will make us wise, understanding, and happy. But if we sin, God will make us struggle for a living, then he will give all we own to someone who pleases him. This makes no more sense than chasing the wind."
Ecclesiastes,3,1,Everything on earth has its own time and its own season.
Ecclesiastes,3,2,"There is a time for birth and death, planting and reaping,"
Ecclesiastes,3,3,"for killing and healing, destroying and building,"
Ecclesiastes,3,4,"for crying and laughing, weeping and dancing,"
Ecclesiastes,3,5,"for throwing stones and gathering stones, embracing and parting."
Ecclesiastes,3,6,"There is a time for finding and losing, keeping and giving,"
Ecclesiastes,3,7,"for tearing and sewing, listening and speaking."
Ecclesiastes,3,8,"There is also a time for love and hate, for war and peace."
Ecclesiastes,3,9,What do we gain by all our hard work?
Ecclesiastes,3,10,I have seen what difficult things God demands of us.
Ecclesiastes,3,11,"God makes everything happen at the right time. Yet none of us can ever fully understand all he has done, and he puts questions in our minds about the past and the future."
Ecclesiastes,3,12,"I know the best thing we can do is always to enjoy life,"
Ecclesiastes,3,13,because God's gift to us is the happiness we get from our food and drink and from the work we do.
Ecclesiastes,3,14,"Everything God has done will last for ever; nothing he does can ever be changed. God has done all this, so that we will worship him."
Ecclesiastes,3,15,"Everything that happens has happened before, and all that will be has already been— God does everything over and over again."
Ecclesiastes,3,16,Everywhere on earth I saw violence and injustice instead of fairness and justice.
Ecclesiastes,3,17,"So I told myself that God has set a time and a place for everything. He will judge everyone, both the wicked and the good."
Ecclesiastes,3,18,I know that God is testing us to show us that we are merely animals.
Ecclesiastes,3,19,"Like animals we breathe and die, and we are no better off than they are. It just doesn't make sense."
Ecclesiastes,3,20,"All living creatures go to the same place. We are made from earth, and we return to the earth."
Ecclesiastes,3,21,Who really knows if our spirits go up and the spirits of animals go down into the earth?
Ecclesiastes,3,22,"We were meant to enjoy our work, and that's the best thing we can do. We can never know the future."
Ecclesiastes,4,1,"I looked again and saw people being ill-treated everywhere on earth. They were crying, but no one was there to offer comfort, and those who ill-treated them were powerful."
Ecclesiastes,4,2,"I said to myself, “The dead are better off than the living."
Ecclesiastes,4,3,"But those who have never been born are better off than anyone else, because they have never seen the terrible things that happen on this earth.”"
Ecclesiastes,4,4,Then I realized that we work and do wonderful things just because we are jealous of others. This makes no more sense than chasing the wind.
Ecclesiastes,4,5,Fools will fold their hands and starve to death.
Ecclesiastes,4,6,Yet a very little food eaten in peace is better than twice as much earned from overwork and chasing the wind.
Ecclesiastes,4,7,Once again I saw that nothing on earth makes sense.
Ecclesiastes,4,8,"For example, some people don't have friends or family. But they are never satisfied with what they own, and they never stop working to get more. They should ask themselves, “Why am I always working to have more? Who will get what I leave behind?” What a senseless and miserable life!"
Ecclesiastes,4,9,"You are better off having a friend than being all alone, because then you will get more enjoyment out of what you earn."
Ecclesiastes,4,10,"If you fall, your friend can help you up. But if you fall without having a friend nearby, you are really in trouble."
Ecclesiastes,4,11,"If you sleep alone, you won't have anyone to keep you warm on a cold night."
Ecclesiastes,4,12,"Someone might be able to beat up one of you, but not both of you. As the saying goes, “A rope made from three strands of cord is hard to break.”"
Ecclesiastes,4,13,"You may be poor and young. But if you are wise, you are better off than a foolish old king who won't listen to advice."
Ecclesiastes,4,14,"Even if you were not born into the royal family and have been a prisoner and poor, you can still be king."
Ecclesiastes,4,15,I once saw everyone in the world follow a young leader who came to power after the king was gone.
Ecclesiastes,4,16,"His followers could not even be counted. But years from now, no one will praise him—this makes no more sense than chasing the wind."
Ecclesiastes,5,1,"Be careful what you do when you enter the house of God. Some fools go there to offer sacrifices, even though they haven't sinned. But it's best just to listen when you go to worship."
Ecclesiastes,5,2,"Don't talk before you think or make promises to God without thinking them through. God is in heaven, and you are on earth, so don't talk too much."
Ecclesiastes,5,3,"If you keep thinking about something, you will dream about it. If you talk too much, you will say the wrong thing."
Ecclesiastes,5,4,God doesn't like fools. So don't be slow to keep your promises to God.
Ecclesiastes,5,5,It's better not to make a promise at all than to make one and not keep it.
Ecclesiastes,5,6,"Don't let your mouth get you in trouble! And don't say to the worship leader, “I didn't mean what I said.” God can destroy everything you have worked for, so don't say something that makes God angry."
Ecclesiastes,5,7,Respect and obey God! Daydreaming leads to a lot of senseless talk.
Ecclesiastes,5,8,"Don't be surprised if the poor of your country are abused, and injustice takes the place of justice. After all, the lower officials must do what the higher ones order them to do."
Ecclesiastes,5,9,"And since the king is the highest official, he benefits most from the taxes paid on the land."
Ecclesiastes,5,10,"If you love money and wealth, you will never be satisfied with what you have. This doesn't make sense either."
Ecclesiastes,5,11,"The more you have, the more everyone expects from you. Your money won't do you any good—others will just spend it for you."
Ecclesiastes,5,12,"If you have to work hard for a living, you can rest well at night, even if you don't have much to eat. But if you are rich, you can't even sleep."
Ecclesiastes,5,13,"I have seen something terribly unfair. People get rich, but it does them no good."
Ecclesiastes,5,14,"Suddenly they lose everything in a bad business deal, then have nothing to leave for their children."
Ecclesiastes,5,15,"They came into this world naked, and when they die, they will be just as naked. They can't take anything with them, and they won't have anything to show for all their work."
Ecclesiastes,5,16,That's terribly unfair. They leave the world just as they came into it. They gained nothing from running after the wind.
Ecclesiastes,5,17,"Besides all this, they are always gloomy at mealtimes, and they are troubled, sick, and bitter."
Ecclesiastes,5,18,"What is the best thing to do in the short life that God has given us? I think we should enjoy eating, drinking, and working hard. This is what God intends us to do."
Ecclesiastes,5,19,Suppose you are very rich and able to enjoy everything you own. Then go ahead and enjoy working hard—this is God's gift to you.
Ecclesiastes,5,20,God will keep you so happy that you won't have time to worry about each day.
Ecclesiastes,6,1,"There is something else terribly unfair, and it troubles everyone on earth."
Ecclesiastes,6,2,"God may give you everything you want—money, property, and wealth. Then God doesn't let you enjoy it, and someone you don't even know gets it all. That's senseless and terribly unfair!"
Ecclesiastes,6,3,"You may live a long time and have a hundred children. But a child born dead is better off than you, unless you enjoy life and have a decent burial."
Ecclesiastes,7,1,A good reputation at the time of death is better than loving care at the time of birth.
Ecclesiastes,7,2,It's better to go to a funeral than to attend a feast; funerals remind us that we all must die.
Ecclesiastes,7,3,Choose sorrow over laughter because a sad face may hide a happy heart.
Ecclesiastes,7,4,"A sensible person mourns, but fools always laugh."
Ecclesiastes,7,5,Harsh correction is better than the songs of a fool.
Ecclesiastes,7,6,Foolish laughter is stupid. It sounds like thorns crackling in a fire.
Ecclesiastes,7,7,"Corruption makes fools of sensible people, and bribes can ruin you."
Ecclesiastes,7,8,Something completed is better than something just begun; patience is better than too much pride.
Ecclesiastes,7,9,Only fools get angry quickly and hold a grudge.
Ecclesiastes,7,10,"It isn't wise to ask, “Why is everything worse than it used to be?”"
Ecclesiastes,7,11,Having wisdom is better than an inheritance.
Ecclesiastes,7,12,Wisdom will protect you just like money; knowledge with good sense will lead you to life.
Ecclesiastes,7,13,"Think of what God has done! If God makes something crooked, can you make it straight?"
Ecclesiastes,7,14,"When times are good, you should be cheerful; when times are bad, think what it means. God makes them both to keep us from knowing what will happen next."
Ecclesiastes,7,15,"I have seen everything during this senseless life of mine. I have seen good citizens die for doing the right thing, and I have seen criminals live to a ripe old age."
Ecclesiastes,7,16,So don't destroy yourself by being too good or acting too clever!
Ecclesiastes,7,17,Don't die before your time by being too evil or acting like a fool.
Ecclesiastes,7,18,Keep to the middle of the road. You can do this if you truly respect God.
Ecclesiastes,7,19,Wisdom will make you stronger than the ten most powerful leaders in your city.
Ecclesiastes,7,20,No one in this world always does right.
Ecclesiastes,7,21,"Don't listen to everything that everyone says, or you might hear your servant cursing you."
Ecclesiastes,7,22,Haven't you cursed many others?
Ecclesiastes,7,23,"I told myself that I would be clever and try to understand all of this, but it was too much for me."
Ecclesiastes,7,24,The truth is beyond us. It's far too deep.
Ecclesiastes,7,25,"So I decided to learn everything I could and become wise enough to discover what life is all about. At the same time, I wanted to understand why it's stupid and senseless to be an evil fool."
Ecclesiastes,7,26,"Here is what I discovered: a bad woman is worse than death. She is a trap, reaching out with body and soul to catch you. But if you obey God, you can escape. If you don't obey, you are done for."
Ecclesiastes,7,27,"With all my wisdom I have tried to find out how everything fits together,"
Ecclesiastes,7,28,"but so far I have not been able to. I do know there is one good man in a thousand, but never have I found a good woman."
Ecclesiastes,7,29,"I did learn one thing: we were completely honest when God created us, but now we have twisted minds."
Ecclesiastes,8,1,Who is clever enough to explain everything? Wisdom makes you cheerful and gives you a smile.
Ecclesiastes,8,2,"If you promised God that you would be loyal to the king, I advise you to keep that promise."
Ecclesiastes,8,3,Don't quickly oppose the king or argue when he has already made up his mind.
Ecclesiastes,8,4,"The king's word is law. No one can ask him, “Why are you doing this?”"
Ecclesiastes,8,5,"If you obey the king, you will stay out of trouble. So be clever and learn what to do and when to do it."
Ecclesiastes,8,6,"Life is hard, but there is a time and a place for everything,"
Ecclesiastes,8,7,though no one can tell the future.
Ecclesiastes,8,8,"We cannot control the wind or determine the day of our death. There is no escape in time of war, and no one can hide behind evil."
Ecclesiastes,8,9,I noticed all this and thought seriously about what goes on in the world. Why does one person have the power to hurt another?
Ecclesiastes,8,10,"I saw the wicked buried with honour, but God's people had to leave the holy city and were forgotten. None of this makes sense."
Ecclesiastes,8,11,"When we see criminals commit crime after crime without being punished, it makes us want to start a life of crime."
Ecclesiastes,8,12,"They commit hundreds of crimes and live to a ripe old age, in spite of the saying: Everyone who lives right and respects God will prosper,"
Ecclesiastes,8,13,but no one who sins and rejects God will prosper or live very long.
Ecclesiastes,8,14,"There is something else that doesn't make sense to me. Good citizens are treated as criminals, while criminals are honoured as though they were good citizens."
Ecclesiastes,8,15,So I think we should get as much out of life as we possibly can. There is nothing better than to enjoy our food and drink and to have a good time. Then we can make it through this troublesome life that God has given us here on earth.
Ecclesiastes,8,16,"Day and night I went without sleep, trying to understand what goes on in this world."
Ecclesiastes,8,17,"I saw everything God does, and I realized that no one can really understand what happens. We may be very wise, but no matter how much we try or how much we claim to know, we cannot understand it all."
Ecclesiastes,9,1,"I thought about these things. Then I understood that God has power over everyone, even those of us who are wise and live right. Anything can happen to any of us, and so we never know if life will be good or bad."
Ecclesiastes,9,2,"But exactly the same thing will finally happen to all of us, whether we live right and respect God or sin and don't respect God. Yes, the same thing will happen if we offer sacrifices to God or if we don't, if we keep our promises or break them."
Ecclesiastes,9,3,"It's terribly unfair for the same thing to happen to each of us. We are mean and foolish while we live, and then we die."
Ecclesiastes,9,4,"As long as we are alive, we still have hope, just as a live dog is better off than a dead lion."
Ecclesiastes,9,5,"We know that we will die, but the dead don't know a thing. Nothing good will happen to them—they are gone and forgotten."
Ecclesiastes,9,6,"Their loves, their hates, and their jealous feelings have all disappeared with them. They will never again take part in anything that happens on this earth."
Ecclesiastes,9,7,Be happy and enjoy eating and drinking! God decided long ago that this is what you should do.
Ecclesiastes,9,8,"Dress up, comb your hair, and look your best."
Ecclesiastes,9,9,"Life is short, and you love your wife, so enjoy being with her. This is what you are supposed to do as you struggle through life on this earth."
Ecclesiastes,9,10,"Work hard at whatever you do. You will soon go to the world of the dead, where no one works or thinks or reasons or knows anything."
Ecclesiastes,9,11,"Here is something else I have learnt: The fastest runners and the greatest heroes don't always win races and battles. Wisdom, intelligence, and skill don't always make you healthy, rich, or popular. We each have our share of bad luck."
Ecclesiastes,9,12,None of us know when we might fall victim to a sudden disaster and find ourselves like fish in a net or birds in a trap.
Ecclesiastes,9,13,Once I saw what people really think of wisdom.
Ecclesiastes,9,14,It happened when a powerful ruler surrounded and attacked a small city where only a few people lived. The enemy army was getting ready to break through the city walls.
Ecclesiastes,9,15,But the city was saved by the wisdom of a poor person who was soon forgotten.
Ecclesiastes,9,16,"So I decided that wisdom is better than strength. Yet if you are poor, no one pays any attention to you, no matter how clever you are."
Ecclesiastes,9,17,Words of wisdom spoken softly make much more sense than the shouts of a ruler to a crowd of fools.
Ecclesiastes,9,18,"Wisdom is more powerful than weapons, yet one mistake can destroy all the good you have done."
Ecclesiastes,10,1,"A few dead flies in perfume make all of it stink, and a little foolishness outweighs a lot of wisdom."
Ecclesiastes,10,2,Sensible thoughts lead you to do right; foolish thoughts lead you to do wrong.
Ecclesiastes,10,3,Fools show their stupidity by the way they live; it's easy to see they have no sense.
Ecclesiastes,10,4,"Don't give up your job when your boss gets angry. If you stay calm, you'll be forgiven."
Ecclesiastes,10,5,Some things rulers do are terribly unfair:
Ecclesiastes,10,6,"they honour fools, but dishonour the rich;"
Ecclesiastes,10,7,"they let slaves ride on horses, but force slave owners to walk."
Ecclesiastes,10,8,"If you dig a pit, you might fall in; if you break down a wall, a snake might bite you."
Ecclesiastes,10,9,You could even get hurt by chiselling a stone or chopping a log.
Ecclesiastes,10,10,"If you don't sharpen your axe, it will be harder to use; if you are clever, you'll know what to do."
Ecclesiastes,10,11,The power to charm a snake does you no good if it bites you anyway.
Ecclesiastes,10,12,"If you talk sensibly, you will have friends; if you talk foolishly, you will destroy yourself."
Ecclesiastes,10,13,"Fools begin with nonsense, and their stupid chatter ends with disaster."
Ecclesiastes,10,14,"They never tire of talking, but none of us really know what the future will bring."
Ecclesiastes,10,15,Fools wear themselves out— they don't know enough to find their way home.
Ecclesiastes,10,16,"A country is in for trouble when its ruler is childish, and its leaders feast all day long."
Ecclesiastes,10,17,"But a nation will prosper when its ruler is mature, and its leaders don't feast too much."
Ecclesiastes,10,18,Some people are too lazy to fix a leaky roof— then the house falls in.
Ecclesiastes,10,19,"Eating and drinking make you feel happy, and bribes can buy everything you need."
Ecclesiastes,10,20,"Don't even think about cursing the king; don't curse the rich, not even in secret. A little bird might hear and tell everything."
Ecclesiastes,11,1,"Be generous, and some day you will be rewarded."
Ecclesiastes,11,2,"Share what you have with seven or eight others, because you never know when disaster may strike."
Ecclesiastes,11,3,Rain clouds always bring rain; trees always stay wherever they fall.
Ecclesiastes,11,4,"If you worry about the weather and don't plant seeds, you won't harvest a crop."
Ecclesiastes,11,5,"No one can explain how a baby breathes before it is born. So how can anyone explain what God does? After all, he created everything."
Ecclesiastes,11,6,"Plant your seeds early in the morning and keep working in the field until dark. Who knows? Your work might pay off, and your seeds might produce."
Ecclesiastes,11,7,Nothing on earth is more beautiful than the morning sun.
Ecclesiastes,11,8,"Even if you live to a ripe old age, you should try to enjoy each day, because darkness will come and will last a long time. Nothing makes sense."
Ecclesiastes,11,9,Be cheerful and enjoy life while you are young! Do what you want and find pleasure in what you see. But don't forget that God will judge you for everything you do.
Ecclesiastes,11,10,"Rid yourself of all worry and pain, because the wonderful moments of youth quickly disappear."
Ecclesiastes,12,1,"Keep your Creator in mind while you are young! In years to come, you will be burdened down with troubles and say, “I don't enjoy life any more.”"
Ecclesiastes,12,2,Some day the light of the sun and the moon and the stars will all seem dim to you. Rain clouds will remain over your head.
Ecclesiastes,12,3,"Your body will grow feeble, your teeth will decay, and your eyesight fail."
Ecclesiastes,12,4,"The noisy grinding of grain will be shut out by your deaf ears, but even the song of a bird will keep you awake."
Ecclesiastes,12,5,"You will be afraid to climb up a hill or walk down a road. Your hair will turn as white as almond blossoms. You will feel lifeless and drag along like an old grasshopper. We each go to our eternal home, and the streets are filled with those who mourn."
Ecclesiastes,12,6,"The silver cord snaps, the golden bowl breaks; the water pitcher is smashed, and the pulley at the well is shattered."
Ecclesiastes,12,7,"So our bodies return to the earth, and the life-giving breath returns to God."
Ecclesiastes,12,8,Nothing makes sense. I have seen it all— nothing makes sense.
Ecclesiastes,12,9,"I was a wise teacher with much understanding, and I collected a number of proverbs that I had carefully studied."
Ecclesiastes,12,10,Then I tried to explain these things in the best and most accurate way.
Ecclesiastes,12,11,"Words of wisdom are like the stick a farmer uses to make animals move. These sayings come from God, our only shepherd, and they are like nails that fasten things together."
Ecclesiastes,12,12,"My child, I warn you to stay away from any teachings except these. There is no end to books, and too much study will wear you out."
Ecclesiastes,12,13,Everything you were taught can be put into a few words: Respect and obey God! This is what life is all about.
Ecclesiastes,12,14,"God will judge everything we do, even what is done in secret, whether good or bad."
Song of Songs,1,1,This is Solomon's most beautiful song.
Song of Songs,1,2,"Kiss me tenderly! Your love is better than wine,"
Song of Songs,1,3,and you smell so sweet. All the young women adore you; the very mention of your name is like spreading perfume.
Song of Songs,2,1,"I am merely a rose from the land of Sharon, a lily from the valley."
Song of Songs,2,2,"My darling, when compared with other young women, you are a lily among thorns."
Song of Songs,2,3,"And you, my love, are an apple tree among trees of the forest. Your shade brought me pleasure; your fruit was sweet."
Song of Songs,2,4,You led me to your banquet room and showered me with love.
Song of Songs,2,5,Refresh and strengthen me with raisins and apples. I am hungry for love!
Song of Songs,2,6,Put your left hand under my head and embrace me with your right arm.
Song of Songs,2,7,"Young women of Jerusalem, promise me by the power of deer and gazelles never to awaken love before it is ready."
Song of Songs,2,8,"I hear the voice of the one I love, as he comes leaping over mountains and hills"
Song of Songs,2,9,"like a deer or a gazelle. Now he stands outside our wall, looking through the window"
Song of Songs,2,10,"and speaking to me. My darling, I love you! Let's go away together."
Song of Songs,2,11,"Winter is past, the rain has stopped;"
Song of Songs,2,12,"flowers cover the earth, it's time to sing. The cooing of doves is heard in our land."
Song of Songs,2,13,"Fig trees are bearing fruit, while blossoms on grapevines fill the air with perfume. My darling, I love you! Let's go away together."
Song of Songs,2,14,You are my dove hiding among the rocks on the side of a cliff. Let me see how lovely you are! Let me hear the sound of your melodious voice.
Song of Songs,2,15,Our vineyards are in blossom; we must catch the little foxes that destroy the vineyards.
Song of Songs,2,16,"My darling, I am yours, and you are mine, as you feed your sheep among the lilies."
Song of Songs,2,17,Pretend to be a young deer dancing on mountain slopes until daylight comes and shadows fade away.
Song of Songs,3,1,"While in bed at night, I reached for the one I love with heart and soul. I looked for him, but he wasn't there."
Song of Songs,3,2,"So I searched through the town for the one I love. I looked in every street, but he wasn't there."
Song of Songs,3,3,"I even asked the guards patrolling the town, “Have you seen the one I love so much?”"
Song of Songs,3,4,"Straight after that, I found him. I held him and would not let go until I had taken him to the home of my mother."
Song of Songs,3,5,"Young women of Jerusalem, promise me by the power of deer and gazelles, never to awaken love before it is ready."
Song of Songs,3,6,"What do we see approaching from the desert like a cloud of smoke? With it comes the sweet smell of spices, including myrrh and frankincense."
Song of Songs,3,7,"It is King Solomon carried on a throne, surrounded by sixty of Israel's best soldiers."
Song of Songs,3,8,"Each of them wears a sword. They are experts at fighting, even in the dark."
Song of Songs,3,9,The throne is made of trees from Lebanon.
Song of Songs,3,10,"Its posts are silver, the back is gold, and the seat is covered with purple cloth. You women of Jerusalem have taken great care to furnish the inside."
Song of Songs,3,11,Now come and see the crown given to Solomon by his mother on his happy wedding day.
Song of Songs,4,1,"My darling, you are lovely, so very lovely— as you look through your veil, your eyes are those of a dove. Your hair tosses about as gracefully as goats coming down from Gilead."
Song of Songs,4,2,"Your teeth are whiter than sheep freshly washed; they match perfectly, not one is missing."
Song of Songs,4,3,"Your lips are crimson cords, your mouth is shapely; behind your veil are hidden beautiful rosy cheeks."
Song of Songs,4,4,"Your neck is more graceful than the tower of David, decorated with thousands of warriors' shields."
Song of Songs,4,5,Your breasts are perfect; they are twin deer feeding among lilies.
Song of Songs,4,6,I will hasten to those hills sprinkled with sweet perfume and stay there till sunrise.
Song of Songs,4,7,"My darling, you are lovely in every way."
Song of Songs,4,8,"My bride, together we will leave Lebanon! We will say goodbye to the peaks of Mount Amana, Senir, and Hermon, where lions and leopards live in the caves."
Song of Songs,4,9,"My bride, my very own, you have stolen my heart! With one glance from your eyes and the glow of your necklace, you have stolen my heart."
Song of Songs,4,10,Your love is sweeter than wine; the smell of your perfume is more fragrant than spices.
Song of Songs,4,11,Your lips are a honeycomb; milk and honey flow from your tongue. Your dress has the aroma of cedar trees from Lebanon.
Song of Songs,4,12,"My bride, my very own, you are a garden, a fountain closed off to all others."
Song of Songs,4,13,"Your arms are vines, covered with delicious fruits and all sorts of spices— henna, nard,"
Song of Songs,4,14,"saffron, calamus, cinnamon, frankincense, myrrh, and aloes— all the finest spices."
Song of Songs,4,15,"You are a spring in the garden, a fountain of pure water, and a refreshing stream from Mount Lebanon."
Song of Songs,4,16,"Let the north wind blow, the south wind too! Let them spread the aroma of my garden, so the one I love may enter and taste its delicious fruits."
Song of Songs,5,1,"My bride, my very own, I come to my garden and enjoy its spices. I eat my honeycomb and honey; I drink my wine and milk. Eat and drink until you are drunk with love."
Song of Songs,5,2,"I was asleep, but dreaming: the one I love was at the door, knocking and saying, “My darling, my very own, my flawless dove, open the door for me! My head is drenched with evening dew.”"
Song of Songs,5,3,But I had already undressed and bathed my feet. Should I dress again and get my feet dirty?
Song of Songs,5,4,"Then my darling's hand reached to open the latch, and my heart stood still."
Song of Songs,5,5,"When I rose to open the door, my hands and my fingers dripped with perfume."
Song of Songs,5,6,"My heart stood still while he spoke to me, but when I opened the door, my darling had disappeared. I searched and shouted, but I could not find him— there was no answer."
Song of Songs,5,7,Then I was found by the guards patrolling the town and guarding the wall. They beat me up and stripped off my robe.
Song of Songs,5,8,"Young women of Jerusalem, if you find the one I love, please say to him, “She is weak with desire.”"
Song of Songs,5,9,"Most beautiful of women, why is the one you love more special than others? Why do you ask us to tell him how you feel?"
Song of Songs,5,10,"He is handsome and healthy, the most outstanding among ten thousand."
Song of Songs,5,11,"His head is purest gold; his hair is wavy, black as a raven."
Song of Songs,5,12,His eyes are a pair of doves bathing in a stream flowing with milk.
Song of Songs,5,13,His face is a garden of sweet-smelling spices; his lips are lilies dripping with perfume.
Song of Songs,5,14,His arms are branches of gold covered with jewels; his body is ivory decorated with sapphires.
Song of Songs,5,15,His legs are columns of marble on feet of gold. He stands there majestic like Mount Lebanon and its choice cedar trees.
Song of Songs,5,16,"His kisses are sweet. I desire him so much! Young women of Jerusalem, he is my lover and friend."
Song of Songs,6,1,"Most beautiful of women, tell us where he has gone. Let us help you find him."
Song of Songs,6,2,"My darling has gone down to his garden of spices, where he will feed his sheep and gather lilies."
Song of Songs,6,3,"I am his, and he is mine, as he feeds his sheep among the lilies."
Song of Songs,6,4,"My dearest, the cities of Tirzah and Jerusalem are not as lovely as you. Your charms are more powerful than all the stars in the heavens."
Song of Songs,6,5,Turn away your eyes— they make me melt. Your hair tosses about as gracefully as goats coming down from Gilead.
Song of Songs,6,6,"Your teeth are whiter than sheep freshly washed; they match perfectly, not one is missing."
Song of Songs,6,7,Behind your veil are hidden beautiful rosy cheeks.
Song of Songs,6,8,"What if I could have sixty queens, eighty wives, and thousands of others!"
Song of Songs,6,9,"You would be my only choice, my flawless dove, the favourite child of your mother. The young women, the queens, and all the others tell how excited you are as they sing your praises:"
Song of Songs,6,10,“You are as majestic as the morning sky— glorious as the moon— blinding as the sun! Your charms are more powerful than all the stars above.”
Song of Songs,6,11,"I went down to see if blossoms were on the walnut trees, grapevines, and fruit trees."
Song of Songs,6,12,But in my imagination I was suddenly riding on a glorious chariot.
Song of Songs,6,13,"Dance! Dance! Beautiful woman from Shulam, let us see you dance! Why do you want to see this woman from Shulam dancing with the others?"
Song of Songs,7,1,"You are a princess, and your feet are graceful in their sandals. Your thighs are works of art, each one a jewel;"
Song of Songs,7,2,your navel is a wine glass filled to overflowing. Your body is full and slender like a bundle of wheat bound together by lilies.
Song of Songs,7,3,Your breasts are like twins of a deer.
Song of Songs,7,4,"Your neck is like ivory, and your eyes sparkle like the pools of Heshbon by the gate of Bath-Rabbim. Your nose is beautiful like Mount Lebanon above the city of Damascus."
Song of Songs,7,5,Your head is held high like Mount Carmel; your hair is so lovely it holds a king prisoner.
Song of Songs,7,6,"You are beautiful, so very desirable!"
Song of Songs,7,7,"You are tall and slender like a palm tree, and your breasts are full."
Song of Songs,7,8,"I will climb that tree and cling to its branches. I will discover that your breasts are clusters of grapes, and that your breath is the aroma of apples."
Song of Songs,7,9,Kissing you is more delicious than drinking the finest wine. How wonderful and tasty!
Song of Songs,7,10,"My darling, I am yours, and you desire me."
Song of Songs,7,11,Let's stroll through the fields and sleep in the villages.
Song of Songs,7,12,"At dawn let's slip out and see if grapevines and fruit trees are covered with blossoms. When we are there, I will give you my love."
Song of Songs,7,13,"Perfume from the magic flower fills the air, my darling. Right at our doorstep I have stored up for you all kinds of tasty fruits."
Song of Songs,8,1,"If you were my brother, I could kiss you whenever we happen to meet, and no one would say I did wrong."
Song of Songs,8,2,"I could take you to the home of my mother, who taught me all I know. I would give you delicious wine and fruit juice as well."
Song of Songs,8,3,Put your left hand under my head and embrace me with your right arm.
Song of Songs,8,4,"Young women of Jerusalem, promise me by the power of deer and gazelles never to awaken love before it is ready."
Song of Songs,8,5,Who is this young woman coming in from the desert and leaning on the shoulder of the one she loves? I stirred up your passions under the apple tree where you were born.
Song of Songs,8,6,"Always keep me in your heart and wear this bracelet to remember me by. The passion of love bursting into flame is more powerful than death, stronger than the grave."
Song of Songs,8,7,"Love cannot be drowned by oceans or floods; it cannot be bought, no matter what is offered."
Song of Songs,8,8,"We have a little sister whose breasts are not yet formed. If someone asks to marry her, what should we do?"
Song of Songs,8,9,She isn't a wall that we can defend behind a silver shield. Neither is she a room that we can protect behind a wooden door.
Song of Songs,8,10,"I am a wall around a city, my breasts are towers, and just looking at me brings him great pleasure."
Song of Songs,8,11,"Solomon has a vineyard at Baal-Hamon, which he rents to others for a thousand pieces of silver each."
Song of Songs,8,12,My vineyard is mine alone! Solomon can keep his silver and the others can keep their share of the profits.
Song of Songs,8,13,You are in the garden with friends all around. Let me hear your voice!
Song of Songs,8,14,"Hurry to me, my darling! Run faster than a deer to mountains of spices."
Isaiah,1,1,"I am Isaiah, the son of Amoz. And this is the message that I was given about Judah and Jerusalem when Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah were the kings of Judah:"
Isaiah,1,2,"The LORD has said, “Listen, heaven and earth! The children I raised have turned against me."
Isaiah,1,3,"Oxen and donkeys know who owns and feeds them, but my people won't ever learn.”"
Isaiah,1,4,"Israel, you are a sinful nation loaded down with guilt. You are wicked and corrupt and have turned from the LORD, the holy God of Israel."
Isaiah,1,5,"Why be punished more? Why not give up your sin? Your head is badly bruised, and you are weak all over."
Isaiah,1,6,"From your head to your toes there isn't a healthy spot. Bruises, cuts, and open sores go without care or oil to ease the pain."
Isaiah,1,7,Your country lies in ruins; your towns are in ashes. Foreigners and strangers take and destroy your land while you watch.
Isaiah,1,8,"Enemies surround Jerusalem, alone like a hut in a vineyard or in a cucumber field."
Isaiah,1,9,"Zion would have disappeared like Sodom and Gomorrah, if the LORD All-Powerful had not let a few of its people survive."
Isaiah,1,10,You are no better than the leaders and people of Sodom and Gomorrah! So listen to the LORD God:
Isaiah,1,11,“Your sacrifices mean nothing to me. I am sick of your offerings of rams and choice cattle; I don't like the blood of bulls or lambs or goats.
Isaiah,1,12,“Who asked you to bring all this when you come to worship me? Stay out of my temple!
Isaiah,1,13,"Your sacrifices are worthless, and incense is disgusting. I can't stand the evil you do on your New Moon Festivals or on your Sabbaths and other times of worship."
Isaiah,1,14,I hate your New Moon Festivals and all others as well. They are a heavy burden I am tired of carrying.
Isaiah,1,15,"“No matter how much you pray, I won't listen. You are too violent."
Isaiah,1,16,Wash yourselves clean! I am disgusted with your filthy deeds. Stop doing wrong
Isaiah,1,17,and learn to live right. See that justice is done. Defend widows and orphans and help those in need.”
Isaiah,1,18,"I, the LORD , invite you to come and talk it over. Your sins are scarlet red, but they will be whiter than snow or wool."
Isaiah,1,19,"If you willingly obey me, the best crops in the land will be yours."
Isaiah,1,20,"But if you turn against me, your enemies will kill you. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Isaiah,1,21,"Jerusalem, you are like an unfaithful wife. Once your judges were honest and your people lived right; now you are a city full of murderers."
Isaiah,1,22,"Your silver is fake, and your wine is watered down."
Isaiah,1,23,Your leaders have rejected me to become friends of crooks; your rulers are looking for gifts and bribes. Widows and orphans never get a fair trial.
Isaiah,1,24,"I am the LORD All-Powerful, the mighty ruler of Israel, and I make you a promise: you are now my enemy, and I will show my anger by taking revenge on you."
Isaiah,1,25,I will punish you terribly and burn away everything that makes you unfit to worship me.
Isaiah,1,26,"Jerusalem, I will choose judges and advisers like those you had before. Your new name will be “Justice and Faithfulness”."
Isaiah,1,27,"Jerusalem, you will be saved by showing justice; Zion's people who turn to me will be saved by doing right."
Isaiah,1,28,"But those rebellious sinners who turn against me, the LORD, will all disappear."
Isaiah,1,29,You will be made ashamed of those groves of trees where you worshipped idols.
Isaiah,1,30,You will be like a grove of trees dying in a drought.
Isaiah,1,31,"Your strongest leaders will be like dry wood set on fire by their idols. No one will be able to help, as they all go up in flames."
Isaiah,2,1,This is the message that I was given about Judah and Jerusalem:
Isaiah,2,2,"In the future, the mountain with the LORD 's temple will be the highest of all. It will reach above the hills; every nation will rush to it."
Isaiah,2,3,"Many people will come and say, “Let's go to the mountain of the LORD God of Jacob and worship in his temple.” The LORD will teach us his Law from Jerusalem, and we will obey him."
Isaiah,2,4,He will settle arguments between nations. They will beat their swords and their spears into rakes and shovels; they will never make war or attack one another.
Isaiah,2,5,"People of Israel, let's live by the light of the LORD."
Isaiah,2,6,"Our LORD , you have deserted your people, Israel, because they follow customs of nations from the east. They worship Philistine gods and are close friends of foreigners."
Isaiah,2,7,They have endless treasures of silver and gold; they have countless horses and war chariots.
Isaiah,2,8,Everywhere in the country they worship the idols they have made.
Isaiah,2,9,"And so, all of them will be ashamed and disgraced. Don't help them!"
Isaiah,2,10,"Every one of you, hide among the rocks and in the ground, because the LORD is fearsome, marvellous, and glorious."
Isaiah,2,11,"When the LORD comes, everyone who is proud will be made humble, and the LORD alone will be honoured."
Isaiah,2,12,The LORD All-Powerful has chosen a day when those who are proud and conceited will be put down.
Isaiah,2,13,"The tall and towering cedars of Lebanon will be destroyed. So will the oak trees of Bashan,"
Isaiah,2,14,"all high mountains and hills,"
Isaiah,2,15,"every strong fortress,"
Isaiah,2,16,"all the seagoing ships, and every beautiful boat."
Isaiah,2,17,"When that day comes, everyone who is proud will be put down. Only the LORD will be honoured."
Isaiah,2,18,Idols will be gone for good.
Isaiah,2,19,"You had better hide in caves and holes— the LORD will be fearsome, marvellous, and glorious when he comes to terrify people on earth."
Isaiah,2,20,On that day everyone will throw to the rats and bats their idols of silver and gold they made to worship.
Isaiah,2,21,"The LORD will be fearsome, marvellous, and glorious when he comes to terrify people on earth— they will hide in caves and in the hills."
Isaiah,2,22,"Stop trusting the power of humans. They are all going to die, so how can they help?"
Isaiah,3,1,"The mighty LORD All-Powerful is going to take away from Jerusalem and Judah everything you need— your bread and water,"
Isaiah,4,1,"When this happens, seven women will grab the same man, and each of them will say, “I'll buy my own food and clothes! Just marry me and take away my disgrace.”"
Isaiah,4,2,"The time is coming when the LORD will make his land fruitful and glorious again, and the people of Israel who survive will take great pride in what the land produces."
Isaiah,4,3,"Everyone who is left alive in Jerusalem will be called special,"
Isaiah,4,4,after the LORD sends a fiery judgment to clean the city and its people of their violent deeds.
Isaiah,4,5,Then the LORD will cover the whole city and its meeting places with a thick cloud each day and with a flaming fire each night. God's own glory will be like a huge tent that covers everything.
Isaiah,4,6,It will provide shade from the heat of the sun and a place of shelter and protection from storms and rain.
Isaiah,5,1,I will sing a song about my friend's vineyard that was on the side of a fertile hill.
Isaiah,5,2,"My friend dug the ground, removed the stones, and planted the best vines. He built a watchtower and dug a pit in rocky ground for pressing the grapes. He hoped they would be sweet, but bitter grapes were all it produced."
Isaiah,5,3,"Listen, people of Jerusalem and of Judah! You be the judge of me and my vineyard."
Isaiah,5,4,"What more could I have done for my vineyard? I hoped for sweet grapes, but bitter grapes were all that grew."
Isaiah,5,5,Now I will let you know what I am going to do. I will cut down the hedge and tear down the wall. My vineyard will be trampled and left in ruins.
Isaiah,5,6,"It will turn into a desert, neither pruned nor hoed; it will be covered with thorns and briars. I will command the clouds not to send rain."
Isaiah,5,7,"I am the LORD All-Powerful! Israel is the vineyard, and Judah is the garden I tended with care. I had hoped for honesty and for justice, but dishonesty and cries for mercy were all I found."
Isaiah,5,8,"You are in for trouble! You take over house after house and field after field, until there is no room left for anyone else in all the land."
Isaiah,5,9,"But the LORD All-Powerful has made this promise to me: Those large and beautiful homes will be left empty, with no one to take care of them."
Isaiah,5,10,"Four hectares of grapevines will produce only twenty-seven litres of juice, and a hundred and eighty litres of seed will produce merely eighteen litres of grain."
Isaiah,5,11,"You are in for trouble! You get up early to start drinking, and you keep it up late into the night."
Isaiah,5,12,"At your drinking parties you have the music of stringed instruments, tambourines, and flutes. But you never even think about all the LORD has done,"
Isaiah,5,13,"and so his people know nothing about him. That's why many of you will be dragged off to foreign lands. Your leaders will starve to death, and everyone else will suffer from thirst."
Isaiah,5,14,"The world of the dead has opened its mouth wide and is eagerly waiting for the leaders of Jerusalem and for its noisy crowds, especially for those who take pride in that city."
Isaiah,5,15,"Its citizens have been put down, and its proud people have been brought to shame."
Isaiah,5,16,"But the holy LORD God All-Powerful is praised, because he has shown who he is by bringing justice."
Isaiah,5,17,"His people will be like sheep grazing in their own pasture, and they will take off what was left by others."
Isaiah,5,18,You are in for trouble! The lies you tell are like ropes by which you drag along sin and evil.
Isaiah,5,19,"And you say, “Let the holy God of Israel hurry up and do what he has promised, so we can see it for ourselves.”"
Isaiah,5,20,"You are headed for trouble! You say wrong is right, darkness is light, and bitter is sweet."
Isaiah,5,21,You think you are clever and wise.
Isaiah,5,22,And you are great at drinking and mixing drinks. But you are in for trouble.
Isaiah,5,23,"You accept bribes to let the guilty go free, and you cheat the innocent out of a fair trial."
Isaiah,5,24,"You will go up in flames like straw and hay! You have rejected the teaching of the holy LORD God All-Powerful of Israel. Now your roots will rot, and your blossoms will turn to dust."
Isaiah,5,25,"You are the LORD 's people, but you made him terribly angry, and he struck you with his mighty arm. Mountains shook, and dead bodies covered the streets like rubbish. The LORD is still angry, and he is ready to strike you again."
Isaiah,5,26,"The LORD has signalled for the foreign nations to come and attack you. He has already whistled, and they are coming as fast as they can."
Isaiah,5,27,"None of them are tired. They don't sleep or get drowsy, and they run without stumbling. Their belts don't come loose; their sandal straps don't break."
Isaiah,5,28,"Their arrows are sharp, and their bows are ready. The hoofs of their horses are hard as flint; the wheels of their war chariots turn as fast as a whirlwind."
Isaiah,5,29,They roar and growl like fierce young lions as they grab their victims and drag them off where no one can rescue them.
Isaiah,5,30,"On the day they attack, they will roar like the sea. And across the land you will see nothing but darkness and trouble, because the light of day will be covered by thick clouds."
Isaiah,6,1,"In the year that King Uzziah died, I had a vision of the LORD . He was on his throne high above, and his robe filled the temple."
Isaiah,6,2,"Flaming creatures with six wings each were flying over him. They covered their faces with two of their wings and their bodies with two more. They used the other two wings for flying,"
Isaiah,6,3,"as they shouted, “Holy, holy, holy, LORD All-Powerful! The earth is filled with your glory.”"
Isaiah,6,4,"As they shouted, the doorposts of the temple shook, and the temple was filled with smoke."
Isaiah,6,5,"Then I cried out, “I'm doomed! Everything I say is sinful, and so are the words of everyone around me. Yet I have seen the King, the LORD All-Powerful.”"
Isaiah,6,6,One of the flaming creatures flew over to me with a burning coal that it had taken from the altar with a pair of metal tongs.
Isaiah,6,7,"It touched my lips with the hot coal and said, “This has touched your lips. Your sins are forgiven, and you are no longer guilty.”"
Isaiah,6,8,"After this, I heard the LORD ask, “Is there anyone I can send? Will someone go for us?” “I'll go,” I answered. “Send me!”"
Isaiah,6,9,"Then the LORD told me to go and speak this message to the people: “You will listen and listen, but never understand. You will look and look, but never see.” The LORD also said,"
Isaiah,6,10,"“Make these people stubborn! Make them stop up their ears, cover their eyes, and fail to understand. Don't let them turn to me and be healed.”"
Isaiah,6,11,"Then I asked the LORD , “How long will this last?” The LORD answered: Until their towns are destroyed and their houses are deserted, until their fields are empty,"
Isaiah,6,12,"and I have sent them far away, leaving their land in ruins."
Isaiah,6,13,"If only a tenth of the people are left, even they will be destroyed. But just as stumps remain after trees have been cut down, some of my chosen ones will be left."
Isaiah,7,1,"Ahaz, the son of Jotham and the grandson of Uzziah, was king of Judah when King Rezin of Syria and King Pekah son of Remaliah of Israel went to attack Jerusalem. But they were not able to do what they had planned."
Isaiah,7,2,"When news reached the royal palace that Syria had joined forces with Israel, King Ahaz and everyone in Judah were so terrified that they shook like trees in a storm."
Isaiah,7,3,Then the LORD said to me: Take your son Shearjashub and go and see King Ahaz. You will find him on the road near the cloth makers' shops at the end of the canal that brings water from the upper pool.
Isaiah,7,4,"Tell Ahaz to stop worrying. There's no need for him to be afraid of King Rezin and King Pekah. They are very angry, but they are nothing more than a dying fire. Ahaz doesn't need to fear"
Isaiah,7,5,their evil threats
Isaiah,7,6,to invade and defeat Judah and Jerusalem and to let the son of Tabeel be king in his place.
Isaiah,7,7,"I, the LORD , promise that this will never happen."
Isaiah,8,1,"The LORD said, “Isaiah, get something to write on. Then write in big clear letters the name, MAHER-SHALAL-HASH-BAZ."
Isaiah,8,2,I will tell Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberechiah to serve as witnesses to this.”
Isaiah,8,3,"Some time later, my wife and I had a son, and the LORD said, “Name him Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz."
Isaiah,8,4,"Because before he can say ‘Mummy’ or ‘Daddy’, the king of Assyria will attack and take everything of value from Damascus and Samaria.”"
Isaiah,8,5,The LORD spoke to me again and said:
Isaiah,8,6,These people have refused the gentle waters of Shiloah and have gladly gone over to the side of King Rezin and King Pekah.
Isaiah,8,7,"Now I will send the king of Assyria against them with his powerful army, which will attack like the mighty River Euphrates overflowing its banks."
Isaiah,8,8,Enemy soldiers will cover Judah like a flood reaching up to your neck. But God is with us. He will spread his wings and protect our land.
Isaiah,8,9,"All you foreign nations, go ahead and prepare for war, but you will be crushed."
Isaiah,8,10,"Get together and make plans, but you will fail because God is with us."
Isaiah,8,11,The LORD took hold of me with his powerful hand and said: I'm warning you! Don't act like these people.
Isaiah,8,12,"Don't call something a rebellious plot, just because they do, and don't be afraid of something, just because they are."
Isaiah,8,13,"I am the one you should fear and respect. I am the holy God, the LORD All-Powerful!"
Isaiah,9,1,But those who have suffered will no longer be in pain. The territories of Zebulun and Naphtali in Galilee were once hated. But this land of the Gentiles across the River Jordan and along the Mediterranean Sea will be greatly respected.
Isaiah,9,2,Those who walked in the dark have seen a bright light. And it shines upon everyone who lives in the land of darkest shadows.
Isaiah,9,3,"Our LORD , you have made your nation stronger. Because of you, its people are glad and celebrate like workers at harvest time or like soldiers dividing up what they have taken."
Isaiah,9,4,You have broken the power of those who abused and enslaved your people. You have rescued them just as you saved your people from Midian.
Isaiah,9,5,The boots of marching warriors and the blood-stained uniforms have been fed to flames and eaten by fire.
Isaiah,9,6,"A child has been born for us. We have been given a son who will be our ruler. His names will be Wonderful Adviser and Mighty God, Eternal Father and Prince of Peace."
Isaiah,9,7,His power will never end; peace will last for ever. He will rule David's kingdom and make it grow strong. He will always rule with honesty and justice. The LORD All-Powerful will make certain that all of this is done.
Isaiah,9,8,"The Lord had warned the people of Israel,"
Isaiah,9,9,"and all of them knew it, including everyone in the capital city of Samaria. But they were proud and stubborn and said,"
Isaiah,9,10,"“Houses of brick and sycamore have fallen to the ground, but we will build houses with stones and cedar.”"
Isaiah,9,11,The LORD made their enemies attack them.
Isaiah,9,12,"He sent the Arameans from the east and the Philistines from the west, and they swallowed up Israel. But even this did not stop him from being angry, so he kept on punishing them."
Isaiah,9,13,The people of Israel still did not turn back to the LORD All-Powerful and worship him.
Isaiah,9,14,"In one day he cut off their head and tail, their leaves and branches."
Isaiah,9,15,"Their rulers and leaders were the head, and the lying prophets were the tail."
Isaiah,9,16,"They had led the nation down the wrong path, and the people were confused."
Isaiah,9,17,"The Lord was angry with his people and kept punishing them, because they had turned against him. They were evil and spoke foolishly. That's why he did not have pity on their young people or on their widows and orphans."
Isaiah,9,18,Evil had spread like a raging forest fire sending thorn bushes up in smoke.
Isaiah,9,19,The LORD All-Powerful was angry and used the people as fuel for a fire that scorched the land. They turned against each other
Isaiah,9,20,"like wild animals attacking and eating everyone around them, even their own relatives. But still they were not satisfied."
Isaiah,9,21,"The tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh turned against each other, then joined forces to attack Judah. But the LORD was still angry and ready to punish the nation even more."
Isaiah,10,1,You people are in for trouble! You have made cruel and unfair laws
Isaiah,10,2,that let you cheat the poor and needy and rob widows and orphans.
Isaiah,10,3,But what will you do when you are fiercely attacked and punished by foreigners? Where will you run for help? Where will you hide your valuables?
Isaiah,10,4,"How will you escape being captured or killed? The Lord is still angry, and he isn't through with you yet!"
Isaiah,10,5,The Lord says: I am furious! And I will use the king of Assyria as a club
Isaiah,10,6,"to beat down you godless people. I am angry with you, and I will send him to attack you. He will take what he wants and walk on you like mud in the streets."
Isaiah,10,7,"He has even bigger plans in mind, because he wants to destroy many nations."
Isaiah,10,8,The king of Assyria says: My army commanders are kings!
Isaiah,10,9,"They have already captured the cities of Calno, Carchemish, Hamath, Arpad, Samaria, and Damascus."
Isaiah,11,1,"Like a branch that sprouts from a stump, someone from David's family will some day be king."
Isaiah,11,2,"The Spirit of the LORD will be with him to give him understanding, wisdom, and insight. He will be powerful, and he will know and honour the LORD."
Isaiah,11,3,His greatest joy will be to obey the LORD. This king won't judge by appearances or listen to rumours.
Isaiah,11,4,"The poor and the needy will be treated with fairness and with justice. His word will be law everywhere in the land, and criminals will be put to death."
Isaiah,11,5,Honesty and fairness will be his royal robes.
Isaiah,11,6,"Leopards will lie down with young goats, and wolves will rest with lambs. Calves and lions will eat together and be cared for by little children."
Isaiah,11,7,Cows and bears will share the same pasture; their young will rest side by side. Lions and oxen will both eat straw.
Isaiah,11,8,Little children will play near snake holes. They will stick their hands into dens of poisonous snakes and never be hurt.
Isaiah,11,9,"Nothing harmful will take place on the LORD 's holy mountain. Just as water fills the sea, the land will be filled with people who know and honour the LORD."
Isaiah,11,10,"The time is coming when one of David's descendants will be the signal for the people of all nations to come together. They will follow his advice, and his own nation will become famous."
Isaiah,11,11,"When that day comes, the Lord will again reach out his mighty arm and bring home his people who have survived in Assyria, Egypt, Pathros, Ethiopia, Elam, Shinar, Hamath, and the land along the coast."
Isaiah,11,12,"He will give a signal to the nations, and he will bring together the refugees from Judah and Israel, who have been scattered all over the earth."
Isaiah,11,13,"Israel will stop being jealous of Judah, and Judah will no longer be the enemy of Israel."
Isaiah,11,14,"Instead, they will get together and attack the Philistines in the west. Then they will defeat the Edomites, the Moabites, and the Ammonites in the east. They will rule those people and take from them whatever they want."
Isaiah,11,15,"The Lord will dry up the arm of the Red Sea near Egypt, and he will send a scorching wind to divide the River Euphrates into seven streams that anyone can step across."
Isaiah,11,16,"Then for his people who survive, there will be a good road from Assyria, just as there was a good road for their ancestors when they left Egypt."
Isaiah,12,1,"At that time you will say, “I thank you, LORD! You were angry with me, but you stopped being angry and gave me comfort."
Isaiah,12,2,"I trust you to save me, LORD God, and I won't be afraid. My power and my strength come from you, and you have saved me.”"
Isaiah,12,3,"With great joy, you people will get water from the well of victory."
Isaiah,12,4,"At that time you will say, “Our LORD , we are thankful, and we worship only you. We will tell the nations how glorious you are and what you have done."
Isaiah,12,5,Because of your wonderful deeds we will sing your praises everywhere on earth.”
Isaiah,12,6,"Sing, people of Zion! Celebrate the greatness of the holy LORD of Israel. God is here to help you."
Isaiah,13,1,This is the message that I was given about Babylon:
Isaiah,13,2,"From high on a barren hill give a signal, shout the orders, and point the way to enter the gates of Babylon's proud rulers."
Isaiah,13,3,The LORD has commanded his very best warriors and his proud heroes to show how angry he is.
Isaiah,13,4,Listen to the noisy crowds on the mountains! Kingdoms and nations are joining forces. The LORD All-Powerful is bringing together an army for battle.
Isaiah,13,5,From a distant land the LORD is coming fierce and furious— he brings his weapons to destroy the earth.
Isaiah,13,6,Cry and weep! The day is coming when the mighty LORD will bring destruction.
Isaiah,14,1,"The LORD will have mercy on Israel and will let them be his chosen people once again. He will bring them back to their own land, and foreigners will join them as part of Israel."
Isaiah,14,2,"Other nations will lead them home, and Israel will make slaves of them in the land that belongs to the Lord. Israel will rule over those who once governed and ill-treated them."
Isaiah,14,3,"The LORD will set you free from your sorrow, suffering, and slavery."
Isaiah,14,4,Then you will make fun of the king of Babylonia by singing this song: That cruel monster is done for! He won't attack us again.
Isaiah,14,5,"The LORD has crushed the power of those evil kings,"
Isaiah,14,6,who were furious and never stopped abusing the people of other nations.
Isaiah,14,7,Now all the world is at peace; its people are celebrating with joyful songs.
Isaiah,14,8,"King of Babylonia, even the cypress trees and the cedars of Lebanon celebrate and say, “Since you were put down, no one comes along to chop us down.”"
Isaiah,14,9,"The world of the dead eagerly waits for you. With great excitement, the spirits of ancient rulers hear about your coming."
Isaiah,14,10,"Each one of them will say, “Now you are just as weak as any of us!"
Isaiah,14,11,"Your pride and your music have ended here in the world of the dead. Worms are your blanket, maggots are your bed.”"
Isaiah,14,12,"You, the bright morning star, have fallen from the sky! You brought down other nations; now you are brought down."
Isaiah,14,13,"You said to yourself, “I'll climb to heaven and place my throne above the highest stars. I'll sit there with the gods far away in the north."
Isaiah,14,14,"I'll be above the clouds, just like God Most High.”"
Isaiah,14,15,But now you are deep in the world of the dead.

Isaiah,28,21,"The LORD will fiercely attack as he did at Mount Perazim and in Gibeon Valley. But this time the LORD will do something surprising, not what you expect."
Isaiah,28,22,So you had better stop sneering or you will be in worse shape than ever before. I heard the LORD All-Powerful threaten the whole country with destruction.
Isaiah,28,23,Pay close attention to what I am saying.
Isaiah,28,24,Farmers don't just plough and break up the ground.
Isaiah,28,25,"When a field is ready, they scatter the seeds of dill and cumin; they plant the seeds of wheat and barley in the proper places."
Isaiah,28,26,They learn this from their God.
Isaiah,28,27,"After dill and cumin have been harvested, the stalks are beaten, not run over with a wagon."
Isaiah,28,28,"Wheat and barley are pounded, but not beaten to pulp; they are run over with a wagon, but not ground to dust."
Isaiah,28,29,"This wonderful knowledge comes from the LORD All-Powerful, who has such great wisdom."
Isaiah,29,1,"Jerusalem, city of David, the place of my altar, you are in for trouble! Celebrate your festivals year after year."
Isaiah,29,2,"I will still make you suffer, and your people will cry when I make an altar of you."
Isaiah,29,3,I will surround you and prepare to attack from all sides.
Isaiah,29,4,"From deep in the earth, you will call out for help with only a faint whisper."
Isaiah,29,5,Then your cruel enemies will suddenly be swept away like dust in a storm.
Isaiah,29,6,"I, the LORD All-Powerful, will come to your rescue with a thundering earthquake and a fiery whirlwind."
Isaiah,29,7,Every brutal nation that attacks Jerusalem and makes it suffer will disappear like a dream when night is over.
Isaiah,29,8,Those nations that attack Mount Zion will suffer from hunger and thirst. They will dream of food and drink but wake up weary and hungry and thirsty as ever.
Isaiah,29,9,"Be shocked and stunned, you prophets! Refuse to see. Get drunk and stagger, but not from wine."
Isaiah,29,10,The LORD has made you drowsy; he put you into a deep sleep and covered your head.
Isaiah,29,11,"Now his message is like a sealed letter to you. Some of you say, “We can't read it, because it's sealed.”"
Isaiah,29,12,"Others say, “We can't read it, because we don't know how to read.”"
Isaiah,29,13,"The Lord has said: “These people praise me with their words, but they never really think about me. They worship me by repeating rules made up by humans."
Isaiah,29,14,"So once again I will do things that shock and amaze them, and I will destroy the wisdom of those who claim to know and understand.”"
Isaiah,29,15,"You are in for trouble, if you try to hide your plans from the LORD! Or if you think what you do in the dark can't be seen."
Isaiah,29,16,"You have it all backwards. A clay dish doesn't say to the potter, “You didn't make me. You don't even know how.”"
Isaiah,29,17,"Soon the forest of Lebanon will become a field with crops, thick as a forest."
Isaiah,29,18,The deaf will be able to hear whatever is read to them; the blind will be freed from a life of darkness.
Isaiah,29,19,"The poor and the needy will celebrate and shout because of the LORD, the holy God of Israel."
Isaiah,29,20,"All who are cruel and arrogant will be gone for ever. Those who live by crime will disappear,"
Isaiah,29,21,together with everyone who tells lies in court and keeps innocent people from getting a fair trial.
Isaiah,29,22,The LORD who rescued Abraham has this to say about Jacob's descendants: “They will no longer be ashamed and disgraced.
Isaiah,29,23,"When they see how great I have made their nation, they will praise and honour me, the holy God of Israel."
Isaiah,29,24,"Everyone who is confused will understand, and all who have complained will obey my teaching.”"
Isaiah,30,1,"This is the LORD 's message for his rebellious people: “You follow your own plans instead of mine; you make treaties without asking me, and you keep on sinning."
Isaiah,30,2,You trust Egypt for protection. So you refuse my advice and send messengers to Egypt to beg their king for help.
Isaiah,30,3,"You will be disappointed, completely disgraced for trusting Egypt."
Isaiah,30,4,The king's power reaches from the city of Zoan as far south as Hanes.
Isaiah,30,5,"But Egypt can't protect you, and to trust that nation is useless and foolish.”"
Isaiah,30,6,This is a message about the animals of the Southern Desert: you people carry treasures on donkeys and camels. You travel to a feeble nation through a troublesome desert filled with lions and flying fiery dragons.
Isaiah,30,7,Egypt can't help you! That's why I call that nation a helpless monster.
Isaiah,30,8,"The LORD told me to write down his message for his people, so that it would be there for ever."
Isaiah,30,9,They have turned against the LORD and can't be trusted. They have refused his teaching
Isaiah,30,10,"and have said to his messengers and prophets: Don't tell us what God has shown you and don't preach the truth. Just say what we want to hear, even if it's false."
Isaiah,30,11,Stop telling us what God has said! We don't want to hear any more about the holy God of Israel.
Isaiah,30,12,"Now this is the answer of the holy God of Israel: “You rejected my message, and you trust in violence and lies."
Isaiah,30,13,This sin is like a crack that makes a high wall quickly crumble
Isaiah,30,14,and shatter like a crushed bowl. There's not a piece left big enough to carry hot coals or to scoop up water.”
Isaiah,30,15,"The holy LORD God of Israel had told all of you, “I will keep you safe if you turn back to me and calm down. I will make you strong if you quietly trust me.” Then you stubbornly"
Isaiah,30,16,"said, “No! We will safely escape on speedy horses.” But those who chase you will be even faster."
Isaiah,30,17,"As few as five of them, or even one, will be enough to chase a thousand of you. Finally, all that will be left will be a few survivors as lonely as a flag pole on a barren hill."
Isaiah,30,18,The LORD God is waiting to show how kind he is and to have pity on you. The LORD always does right; he blesses those who trust him.
Isaiah,30,19,"People of Jerusalem, you don't need to cry any more. The Lord is kind, and as soon as he hears your cries for help, he will come."
Isaiah,30,20,"The Lord has given you trouble and sorrow as your food and drink. But now you will again see the Lord, your teacher, and he will guide you."
Isaiah,30,21,"Whether you turn to the right or to the left, you will hear a voice saying, “This is the road! Now follow it.”"
Isaiah,30,22,Then you will treat your idols of silver and gold like rubbish; you will throw them away like filthy rags.
Isaiah,30,23,"The Lord will send rain to water the seeds you have planted—your fields will produce more crops than you need, and your cattle will graze in open pastures."
Isaiah,30,24,Even the oxen and donkeys that plough your fields will be fed the finest grain.
Isaiah,30,25,"On that day people will be slaughtered and towers destroyed, but streams of water will flow from high hills and towering mountains."
Isaiah,30,26,"Then the LORD will bandage his people's injuries and heal the wounds he has caused. The moon will shine as bright as the sun, and the sun will shine seven times brighter than usual. It will be like the light of seven days all at once."
Isaiah,30,27,The LORD is coming from far away with his fiery anger and thick clouds of smoke. His angry words flame up like a destructive fire;
Isaiah,30,28,he breathes out a flood that comes up to the neck. He sifts the nations and destroys them. Then he puts a bridle in every foreigner's mouth and leads them to doom.
Isaiah,30,29,"The LORD 's people will sing as they do when they celebrate a religious festival at night. The LORD is Israel's mighty rock, and his people will be as happy as they are when they follow the sound of flutes to the mountain where he is worshipped."
Isaiah,30,30,"The LORD will get furious. His fearsome voice will be heard, his arm will be seen ready to strike, and his anger will be like a destructive fire, followed by thunderstorms and hailstones."
Isaiah,30,31,"When the Assyrians hear the LORD 's voice and see him striking with his iron rod, they will be terrified."
Isaiah,30,32,"He will attack them in battle, and each time he strikes them, it will be to the music of tambourines and harps."
Isaiah,30,33,"Long ago the LORD got a place ready for burning the body of the dead king. The place for the fire is deep and wide, the wood is piled high, and the LORD will start the fire by breathing out flaming sulphur."
Isaiah,31,1,"You are in for trouble if you go to Egypt for help, or if you depend on an army of chariots or a powerful cavalry. Instead you should depend on and trust the holy LORD God of Israel."
Isaiah,31,2,"The LORD isn't stupid! He does what he promises, and he can bring doom. If you are cruel yourself, or help those who are evil, you will be destroyed."
Isaiah,31,3,"The Egyptians are mere humans. They aren't God. Their horses are made of flesh; they can't live for ever. When the LORD shows his power, he will destroy the Egyptians and all who depend on them. Together they will fall."
Isaiah,31,4,"The LORD All-Powerful said to me, “I will roar and attack like a fearless lion not frightened by the shouts of shepherds trying to protect their sheep. That's how I will come down and fight on Mount Zion."
Isaiah,31,5,"I, the LORD All-Powerful, will protect Jerusalem like a mother bird circling over her nest.”"
Isaiah,31,6,"People of Israel, come back! You have completely turned from the LORD."
Isaiah,31,7,"The time is coming when you will throw away your idols of silver and gold, made by your sinful hands."
Isaiah,31,8,"The Assyrians will be killed, but not by the swords of humans. Their young men will try to escape, but they will be captured and forced into slavery."
Isaiah,31,9,"Their fortress will fall when terror strikes; their army officers will be frightened and run from the battle. This is what the LORD has said, the LORD whose fiery furnace is built on Mount Zion."
Isaiah,32,1,A king and his leaders will rule with justice.
Isaiah,32,2,"They will be a place of safety from stormy winds, a stream in the desert, and a rock that gives shade from the heat of the sun."
Isaiah,32,3,"Then everyone who has eyes will open them and see, and those who have ears will pay attention."
Isaiah,32,4,All who are impatient will take time to think; everyone who stutters will talk clearly.
Isaiah,32,5,"Fools will no longer be highly respected, and crooks won't be given positions of honour."
Isaiah,32,6,"Fools talk foolishness. They always make plans to do sinful things, to lie about the LORD, to let the hungry starve, and to keep water from those who are thirsty."
Isaiah,32,7,"Cruel people tell lies— they do evil things, and make cruel plans to destroy the poor and needy, even when they beg for justice."
Isaiah,32,8,But helpful people can always be trusted to make helpful plans.
Isaiah,32,9,"Listen to what I say, you women who are carefree and careless!"
Isaiah,32,10,"You may not have worries now, but in about a year, the grape harvest will fail, and you will tremble."
Isaiah,32,11,"Shake and shudder, you women without a care! Strip off your clothes— put on sackcloth."
Isaiah,32,12,"Slap your breasts in sorrow because of what happened to the fruitful fields and vineyards,"
Isaiah,32,13,and to the happy homes in Jerusalem. The land of my people is covered with thorns.
Isaiah,32,14,"The palace will be deserted, the crowded city empty. Fortresses and towers will for ever become playgrounds for wild donkeys and pastures for sheep."
Isaiah,32,15,"When the Spirit is given to us from heaven, deserts will become orchards thick as fertile forests."
Isaiah,32,16,"Honesty and justice will prosper there,"
Isaiah,32,17,and justice will produce lasting peace and security.
Isaiah,32,18,"You, the LORD 's people, will live in peace, calm and secure,"
Isaiah,32,19,even if hailstones flatten forests and cities.
Isaiah,32,20,"You will have God's blessing, as you plant your crops beside streams, while your donkeys and cattle roam freely about."
Isaiah,33,1,"You defeated my people. Now you're in for trouble! You've never been destroyed, but you will be destroyed; you've never been betrayed, but you will be betrayed. When you have finished destroying and betraying, you will be destroyed and betrayed in return."
Isaiah,33,2,"Please, LORD , be kind to us! We depend on you. Make us strong each morning, and come to save us when we are in trouble."
Isaiah,33,3,Nations scatter when you roar and show your greatness.
Isaiah,33,4,We attack our enemies like swarms of locusts; we take everything that belongs to them.
Isaiah,33,5,"You, LORD , are above all others, and you live in the heavens. You have brought justice and fairness to Jerusalem;"
Isaiah,33,6,you are the foundation on which we stand today. You always save us and give true wisdom and knowledge. Nothing means more to us than obeying you.
Isaiah,33,7,"Listen! Our bravest soldiers are running through the streets, screaming for help. Our messengers hoped for peace, but came home crying."
Isaiah,33,8,"No one travels any more; every road is empty. Treaties are broken, and no respect is shown to any who keep promises."
Isaiah,33,9,Fields are dry and barren; Mount Lebanon wilts with shame. Sharon Valley is a desert; the forests of Bashan and Carmel have lost their leaves.
Isaiah,33,10,"But the LORD says, “Now I will do something and be greatly praised."
Isaiah,33,11,Your deeds are straw that will be set on fire by your very own breath.
Isaiah,33,12,You will be burnt to ashes like thorns in a fire.
Isaiah,33,13,"Everyone, both far and near, come, look at what I have done. See my mighty power!”"
Isaiah,33,14,"Those terrible sinners on Mount Zion tremble as they ask in fear, “How can we possibly live where a raging fire never stops burning?”"
Isaiah,33,15,"But there will be rewards for those who live right and tell the truth, for those who refuse to take money by force or accept bribes, for all who hate murder and violent crimes."
Isaiah,33,16,"They will live in a fortress high on a rocky cliff, where they will have food and plenty of water."
Isaiah,33,17,With your own eyes you will see the glorious King; you will see his kingdom reaching far and wide.
Isaiah,33,18,"Then you will ask yourself, “Where are those officials who terrified us and forced us to pay such heavy taxes?”"
Isaiah,33,19,You will never again have to see the proud people who spoke a strange and foreign language you could not understand.
Isaiah,33,20,"Look to Mount Zion where we celebrate our religious festivals. You will see Jerusalem, secure as a tent with pegs that cannot be pulled up and fastened with ropes that can never be broken."
Isaiah,33,21,Our wonderful LORD will be with us! There will be deep rivers and wide streams safe from enemy ships.
Isaiah,33,22,The LORD is our judge and our ruler; the LORD is our king and will keep us safe.
Isaiah,33,23,"But your nation is a ship with its rigging loose, its mast shaky, and its sail not spread. Some day even you who are lame will take everything you want from your enemies."
Isaiah,33,24,"The LORD will forgive your sins, and none of you will say, “I feel ill.”"
Isaiah,34,1,"Everyone of every nation, the entire earth, and all its creatures, come here and listen!"
Isaiah,34,2,The LORD is terribly angry with the nations; he has condemned them to be slaughtered.
Isaiah,34,3,Their dead bodies will be left to rot and stink; their blood will flow down the mountains.
Isaiah,34,4,Each star will disappear— the sky will roll up like a scroll. Everything in the sky will dry up and wilt like leaves on a vine or fruit on a tree.
Isaiah,34,5,"After the sword of the LORD has done what it wants to the skies above, it will come down on Edom, the nation that the LORD has doomed for destruction."
Isaiah,34,6,"The sword of the LORD is covered with blood from lambs and goats, together with fat from kidneys of rams. This is because the LORD will slaughter many people and make a sacrifice of them in the city of Bozrah and everywhere else in Edom."
Isaiah,34,7,"Edom's leaders are wild oxen. They are powerful bulls, but they will die with the others. Their country will be soaked with their blood, and its soil made fertile with their fat."
Isaiah,34,8,"The LORD has chosen the year and the day, when he will take revenge and come to Zion's defence."
Isaiah,34,9,Edom's streams will turn into tar and its soil into sulphur— then the whole country will go up in flames.
Isaiah,34,10,"It will burn night and day and never stop smoking. Edom will be a desert, generation after generation; no one will ever travel through that land."
Isaiah,34,11,"Owls, hawks, and wild animals will make it their home. God will leave it in ruins, merely a pile of rocks."
Isaiah,34,12,Edom will be called “Kingdom of Nothing”. Its rulers will also be nothing.
Isaiah,34,13,Its palaces and fortresses will be covered with thorns; only wolves and ostriches will make their home there.
Isaiah,34,14,"Wildcats and hyenas will hunt together, demons will scream to demons, and creatures of the night will live among the ruins."
Isaiah,34,15,"Owls will nest there to raise their young among its shadows, while families of vultures circle around."
Isaiah,34,16,"In The Book of the Lord you can search and find where it is written, “The LORD brought together all his creatures by the power of his Spirit. Not one is missing.”"
Isaiah,34,17,"The LORD has decided where they each should live; they will be there for ever, generation after generation."
Isaiah,35,1,Thirsty deserts will be glad; barren lands will celebrate and blossom with flowers.
Isaiah,35,2,"Deserts will bloom everywhere and sing joyful songs. They will be as majestic as Mount Lebanon, as glorious as Mount Carmel or Sharon Valley. Everyone will see the wonderful splendour of the LORD our God."
Isaiah,36,1,Hezekiah had been king of Judah for fourteen years when King Sennacherib of Assyria invaded the country and captured every walled city
Isaiah,36,2,except Jerusalem. The Assyrian king ordered his army commander to leave the city of Lachish and to take a large army to Jerusalem. The commander went there and stood on the road near the cloth makers' shops along the canal from the upper pool.
Isaiah,36,3,"Three of the king's highest officials came out of Jerusalem to meet him. One of them was Hilkiah's son Eliakim, who was the prime minister. The other two were Shebna, assistant to the prime minister, and Joah son of Asaph, keeper of the government records."
Isaiah,36,4,The Assyrian commander told them: I have a message for Hezekiah from the great king of Assyria. Ask Hezekiah why he feels so sure of himself.
Isaiah,36,5,"Does he think he can plan and win a war with nothing but words? Who is going to help him, now that he has turned against the king of Assyria?"
Isaiah,36,6,"Is he depending on Egypt and its king? That's the same as leaning on a broken stick, and it will go right through his hand."
Isaiah,36,7,"Is Hezekiah now depending on the LORD , your God? Didn't Hezekiah tear down all except one of the LORD 's altars and places of worship? Didn't he tell the people of Jerusalem and Judah to worship at that one place?"
Isaiah,36,8,"The king of Assyria wants to make a bet with you people! He will give you two thousand horses, if you have enough troops to ride them."
Isaiah,36,9,"How could you defeat even our lowest ranking officer, when you have to depend on Egypt for chariots and cavalry?"
Isaiah,36,10,Don't forget that it was the LORD who sent me here with orders to destroy your nation!
Isaiah,36,11,"Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said, “Sir, we don't want the people listening from the city wall to understand what you are saying. So please speak to us in Aramaic instead of Hebrew.”"
Isaiah,36,12,"The Assyrian army commander answered, “My king sent me to speak to everyone, not just to you leaders. These people will soon have to eat their own body waste and drink their own urine! And so will the three of you!”"
Isaiah,36,13,"Then, in a voice loud enough for everyone to hear, he shouted out in Hebrew: Listen to what the great king of Assyria says!"
Isaiah,36,14,Don't be fooled by Hezekiah. He can't save you.
Isaiah,36,15,Don't trust him when he tells you that the LORD will protect you from the king of Assyria.
Isaiah,36,16,"Stop listening to Hezekiah. Pay attention to my king. Surrender to him. He will let you keep your own vineyards, fig trees, and cisterns"
Isaiah,36,17,"for a while. Then he will come and take you away to a country just like yours, where you can plant vineyards and raise your own grain."
Isaiah,36,18,Hezekiah claims the LORD will save you. But don't be fooled by him. Were any other gods able to defend their land against the king of Assyria?
Isaiah,36,19,"What happened to the gods of Hamath, Arpad, and Sepharvaim? Were the gods of Samaria able to protect their land against the Assyrian forces?"
Isaiah,36,20,"None of these gods kept their people safe from the king of Assyria. Do you think the LORD , your God, can do any better?"
Isaiah,37,1,"As soon as Hezekiah heard the news, he tore off his clothes in sorrow and put on sackcloth. Then he went into the temple of the LORD."
Isaiah,37,2,"He told Prime Minister Eliakim, Assistant Prime Minister Shebna, and the senior priests to dress in sackcloth and tell me:"
Isaiah,37,3,"Isaiah, these are difficult and disgraceful times. Our nation is like a woman too weak to give birth, when it's time for her baby to be born."
Isaiah,37,4,"Please pray for those of us who are left alive. The king of Assyria sent his army commander to insult the living God. Perhaps the LORD heard what he said and will do something, if you will pray."
Isaiah,37,5,"When these leaders came to me,"
Isaiah,37,6,I told them that the LORD had this message for Hezekiah: I am the LORD . Don't worry about the insulting things that have been said about me by these messengers from the king of Assyria.
Isaiah,37,7,"I will upset him with rumours about what's happening in his own country. He will go back, and there I will make him die a violent death."
Isaiah,37,8,Meanwhile the commander of the Assyrian forces heard that his king had left the town of Lachish and was now attacking Libnah. So he went there.
Isaiah,37,9,"About this same time, the king of Assyria learnt that King Tirhakah of Ethiopia was on his way to attack him. Then the king of Assyria sent some messengers with this note for Hezekiah:"
Isaiah,37,10,Don't trust your God or be fooled by his promise to defend Jerusalem against me.
Isaiah,37,11,You have heard how we Assyrian kings have completely wiped out other nations. What makes you feel so safe?
Isaiah,37,12,"The Assyrian kings before me destroyed the towns of Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and everyone from Eden who lived in Telassar. What good did their gods do them?"
Isaiah,37,13,"The kings of Hamath, Arpad, Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah have all disappeared."
Isaiah,37,14,"After Hezekiah had read the note from the king of Assyria, he took it to the temple and spread it out for the LORD to see."
Isaiah,37,15,Then he prayed:
Isaiah,37,16," LORD God All-Powerful of Israel, your throne is above the winged creatures. You created the heavens and the earth, and you alone rule the kingdoms of this world."
Isaiah,37,17,"Just look and see how Sennacherib has insulted you, the living God."
Isaiah,37,18,"It is true, our LORD , that Assyrian kings have turned nations into deserts."
Isaiah,37,19,They destroyed the idols of wood and stone that the people of those nations had made and worshipped.
Isaiah,37,20,But you are our LORD and our God! We ask you to keep us safe from the Assyrian king. Then everyone in every kingdom on earth will know that you are the only LORD.
Isaiah,38,1,"About this time, Hezekiah got sick and was almost dead. So I went in and told him, “The LORD says you won't ever get well. You are going to die, and so you had better start doing what needs to be done.”"
Isaiah,38,2,"Hezekiah turned towards the wall and prayed,"
Isaiah,38,3,"“Don't forget that I have been faithful to you, LORD . I have obeyed you with all my heart, and I do whatever you say is right.” After this, he cried hard."
Isaiah,38,4,Then the LORD sent me
Isaiah,38,5,"with this message for Hezekiah: I am the LORD God, who was worshipped by your ancestor David. I heard you pray, and I saw you cry. I will let you live fifteen years more,"
Isaiah,38,6,while I protect you and your city from the king of Assyria.
Isaiah,38,7,Now I will prove to you that I will keep my promise.
Isaiah,38,8,Do you see the shadow made by the setting sun on the stairway built for King Ahaz? I will make the shadow go back ten steps. Then the shadow went back ten steps.
Isaiah,38,9,This is what Hezekiah wrote after he got well:
Isaiah,38,10,I thought I would die during my best years and stay as a prisoner for ever in the world of the dead.
Isaiah,38,11,"I thought I would never again see you, my LORD, or any of the people who live on this earth."
Isaiah,38,12,My life was taken from me like the tent that a shepherd pulls up and moves. You cut me off like thread from a weaver's loom; you make a wreck of me day and night.
Isaiah,38,13,"Until morning came, I thought you would crush my bones just like a hungry lion; both night and day you make a wreck of me."
Isaiah,38,14,"I cry like a swallow; I mourn like a dove. My eyes are red from looking to you, LORD. I am terribly abused. Please come and help me."
Isaiah,38,15,"There's nothing I can say in answer to you, since you are the one who has done this to me. My life has turned sour; I will limp until I die."
Isaiah,38,16,"Your words and your deeds bring life to everyone, including me. Please make me healthy and strong again."
Isaiah,38,17,"It was for my own good that I had such hard times. But your love protected me from doom in the deep pit, and you turned your eyes away from my sins."
Isaiah,38,18,No one in the world of the dead can thank you or praise you; none of those in the deep pit can hope for you to show them how faithful you are.
Isaiah,38,19,"Only the living can thank you, as I am doing today. Each generation tells the next about your faithfulness."
Isaiah,38,20,"You, LORD , will save me, and every day that we live we will sing in your temple to the music of stringed instruments."
Isaiah,38,21,"I had told King Hezekiah's servants to put some mashed figs on the king's open sore, and he would get well."
Isaiah,38,22,Then Hezekiah asked for proof that he would again worship in the LORD 's temple.
Isaiah,39,1,"Merodach Baladan, the son of Baladan, was now king of Babylonia. And when he learnt that Hezekiah was well, he sent messengers with letters and a gift for him."
Isaiah,39,2,"Hezekiah welcomed the messengers and showed them all the silver, the gold, the spices, and the fine oils that were in his storehouse. He even showed them where he kept his weapons. Nothing in his palace or in his entire kingdom was kept hidden from them."
Isaiah,39,3,"I asked Hezekiah, “Where did these men come from? What did they want?” “They came all the way from Babylonia,” Hezekiah answered."
Isaiah,39,4,"“What did you show them?” I asked. Hezekiah answered, “I showed them everything in my kingdom.”"
Isaiah,39,5,Then I told Hezekiah: I have a message for you from the LORD All-Powerful.
Isaiah,39,6,One day everything you and your ancestors have stored up will be taken to Babylonia. The LORD has promised that nothing will be left.
Isaiah,39,7,"Some of your own sons will be taken to Babylonia, where they will be disgraced and made to serve in the king's palace."
Isaiah,39,8,"Hezekiah thought, “At least our nation will be at peace for a while.” So he told me, “The message you brought from the LORD is good.”"
Isaiah,40,1,Our God has said: “Encourage my people! Give them comfort.
Isaiah,40,2,"Speak kindly to Jerusalem and announce: Your slavery is past; your punishment is over. I, the LORD , made you pay double for your sins.”"
Isaiah,40,3,Someone is shouting: “Clear a path in the desert! Make a straight road for the LORD our God.
Isaiah,40,4,Fill in the valleys; flatten every hill and mountain. Level the rough and rugged ground.
Isaiah,40,5,Then the glory of the LORD will appear for all to see. The LORD has promised this!”
Isaiah,40,6,"Someone told me to shout, and I asked, “What should I shout?” We humans are merely grass, and we last no longer than wild flowers."
Isaiah,40,7,"At the LORD 's command, flowers and grass disappear, and so do we."
Isaiah,40,8,"Flowers and grass fade away, but what our God has said will never change."
Isaiah,40,9,"There is good news for the city of Zion. Shout it as loud as you can from the highest mountain. Don't be afraid to shout to the towns of Judah, “Your God is here!”"
Isaiah,40,10,"Look! The powerful LORD God is coming to rule with his mighty arm. He brings with him what he has taken in war, and he rewards his people."
Isaiah,40,11,"The LORD cares for his nation, just as shepherds care for their flocks. He carries the lambs in his arms, while gently leading the mother sheep."
Isaiah,40,12,Did any of you measure the ocean by yourself or stretch out the sky with your own hands? Did you put the soil of the earth in a bucket or weigh the hills and mountains on balance scales?
Isaiah,40,13,Has anyone told the LORD what he must do or given him advice?
Isaiah,40,14,Did the LORD ask anyone to teach him wisdom and justice? Who gave him knowledge and understanding?
Isaiah,40,15,"To the LORD , all nations are merely a drop in a bucket or dust on balance scales; all the islands are but a handful of sand."
Isaiah,40,16,"The cattle on Lebanon's mountains would not be enough to offer as a sacrifice to God, and the trees would not be enough for the fire."
Isaiah,40,17,God thinks of the nations as far less than nothing.
Isaiah,40,18,Who compares with God? Is anything like him?
Isaiah,40,19,"Is an idol at all like God? It is made of bronze with a thin layer of gold, and decorated with silver."
Isaiah,40,20,Or special wood may be chosen because it doesn't rot— then skilled hands take care to make an idol that won't fall on its face.
Isaiah,40,21,Don't you know? Haven't you heard? Isn't it clear that God created the world?
Isaiah,40,22,"God is the one who rules the whole earth, and we who live here are merely insects. He spread out the heavens like a curtain or an open tent."
Isaiah,40,23,God brings down rulers and turns them into nothing.
Isaiah,40,24,"They are like flowers freshly sprung up and starting to grow. But when God blows on them, they wilt and are carried off like straw in a storm."
Isaiah,40,25,"The holy God asks, “Who compares with me? Is anyone my equal?”"
Isaiah,40,26,Look at the evening sky! Who created the stars? Who gave them each a name? Who leads them like an army? The LORD is so powerful that none of the stars are ever missing.
Isaiah,40,27,"You people of Israel, say, “God pays no attention to us! He doesn't care if we are treated unjustly.” But how can you say that?"
Isaiah,40,28,"Don't you know? Haven't you heard? The LORD is the eternal God, Creator of the earth. He never gets weary or tired; his wisdom cannot be measured."
Isaiah,40,29,The LORD gives strength to those who are weary.
Isaiah,40,30,"Even young people get tired, then stumble and fall."
Isaiah,40,31,But those who trust the LORD will find new strength. They will be strong like eagles soaring upward on wings; they will walk and run without getting tired.
Isaiah,41,1,"Be silent and listen, every island in the sea. Have courage and come near, every one of you nations. Let's settle this matter!"
Isaiah,41,2,Who appointed this ruler from the east? Who puts nations and kings in his power? His sword and his arrows turn them to dust blown by the wind.
Isaiah,41,3,He goes after them so quickly that his feet barely touch the ground— he doesn't even get hurt.
Isaiah,41,4,Who makes these things happen? Who controls human events? I do! I am the LORD. I was there at the beginning; I will be there at the end.
Isaiah,41,5,Islands and foreign nations saw what I did and trembled as they came near.
Isaiah,41,6,"Worshippers of idols comfort each other, saying, “Don't worry!”"
Isaiah,41,7,"Woodcarvers, goldsmiths, and other workers encourage one another and say, “We've done a great job!” Then they nail the idol down, so it won't fall over."
Isaiah,41,8,"Israel, you are my servant. I chose you, the family of my friend Abraham."
Isaiah,41,9,"From far across the earth I brought you here and said, “You are my chosen servant. I haven't forgotten you.”"
Isaiah,41,10,"Don't be afraid. I am with you. Don't tremble with fear. I am your God. I will make you strong, as I protect you with my arm and give you victories."
Isaiah,41,11,Everyone who hates you will be terribly disgraced; those who attack will vanish into thin air.
Isaiah,41,12,"You will look around for those brutal enemies, but you won't find them because they will be gone."
Isaiah,41,13,"I am the LORD your God. I am holding your hand, so don't be afraid. I am here to help you."
Isaiah,41,14,"People of Israel, don't worry, though others may say, “Israel is only a worm!” I am the holy God of Israel, who saves and protects you."
Isaiah,41,15,I will let you be like a log covered with sharp spikes. You will grind and crush every mountain and hill until they turn to dust.
Isaiah,41,16,"A strong wind will scatter them in all directions. Then you will celebrate and praise me, your LORD, the holy God of Israel."
Isaiah,41,17,"When the poor and needy are dying of thirst and cannot find water, I, the LORD God of Israel, will come to their rescue. I won't forget them."
Isaiah,41,18,I will make rivers flow on mountain peaks. I will send streams to fill the valleys. Dry and barren land will flow with springs and become a lake.
Isaiah,41,19,"I will fill the desert with all kinds of trees— cedars, acacias, and myrtles; olive and cypress trees; fir trees and pines."
Isaiah,41,20,"Everyone will see this and know that I, the holy LORD God of Israel, created it all."
Isaiah,41,21,"I am the LORD, the King of Israel! Come, argue your case with me. Present your evidence."
Isaiah,41,22,"Come near me, you idols. Tell us about the past, and we will think about it. Tell us about the future, so we will know what is going to happen."
Isaiah,41,23,"Prove that you are gods by making your predictions come true. Do something good or evil, so we can be amazed and terrified."
Isaiah,41,24,"You idols are nothing, and you are powerless. To worship you would be disgusting."
Isaiah,41,25,"I, the LORD , appointed a ruler in the north; now he comes from the east to honour my name. He tramples kings like mud, as potters trample clay."
Isaiah,41,26,Did any of you idols predict what would happen? Did any of you get it right? None of you told about this or even spoke a word.
Isaiah,41,27,"I was the first to tell the people of Jerusalem, “Look, it's happening!” I was the one who announced this good news to Zion."
Isaiah,41,28,None of these idols are able to give advice or answer questions.
Isaiah,41,29,"They are nothing, and they can do nothing— they are less than a passing breeze."
Isaiah,42,1,"Here is my servant! I have made him strong. He is my chosen one; I am pleased with him. I have given him my Spirit, and he will bring justice to the nations."
Isaiah,42,2,He won't shout or yell or call out in the streets.
Isaiah,42,3,"He won't break off a bent reed or put out a dying flame, but he will make sure that justice is done."
Isaiah,42,4,"He won't stop or give up until he brings justice everywhere on earth, and people in foreign nations long for his teaching."
Isaiah,42,5,"I am the LORD God. I created the heavens like an open tent above. I made the earth and everything that grows on it. I am the source of life for all who live on this earth, so listen to what I say."
Isaiah,42,6,"I chose you to bring justice, and I am here at your side. I selected and sent you to bring light and my promise of hope to the nations."

Isaiah,42,8,My name is the LORD! I won't let idols or humans share my glory and praise.
Isaiah,42,9,Everything has happened just as I said it would; now I will announce what will happen next.

Isaiah,42,11,Tell the tribes of the desert and everyone in the mountains to celebrate and sing.
Isaiah,42,12,Let them announce his praises everywhere.
Isaiah,42,13,"The LORD is marching out like an angry soldier, shouting with all his might while attacking his enemies."
Isaiah,42,14,"For a long time, I, the LORD, have held my temper; now I will scream and groan like a woman giving birth."
Isaiah,42,15,I will destroy the mountains and what grows on them; I will dry up rivers and ponds.
Isaiah,42,16,"I will lead the blind on roads they have never known; I will guide them on paths they have never travelled. Their road is dark and rough, but I will give light to keep them from stumbling. This is my solemn promise."
Isaiah,42,17,Everyone who worships idols as though they were gods will be terribly ashamed.
Isaiah,42,18,"You people are deaf and blind, but the LORD commands you to listen and to see."
Isaiah,42,19,"No one is as blind or deaf as his messenger, his chosen servant,"
Isaiah,42,20,"who sees and hears so much, but pays no attention."
Isaiah,42,21,"The LORD always does right, and so he wanted his Law to be greatly praised."
Isaiah,42,22,"But his people were trapped and imprisoned in holes with no one to rescue them. All they owned had been taken, and no one was willing to give it back."
Isaiah,42,23,Why won't his people ever learn to listen?
Isaiah,42,24,Israel sinned and refused to obey the LORD or follow his instructions. So the LORD let them be robbed of everything they owned.
Isaiah,42,25,He was furious with them and punished their nation with the fires of war. Still they paid no attention. They didn't even care when they were surrounded and scorched by flames.
Isaiah,43,1,"Descendants of Jacob, I, the LORD , created you and formed your nation. Israel, don't be afraid. I have rescued you. I have called you by name; now you belong to me."
Isaiah,43,2,"When you cross deep rivers, I will be with you, and you won't drown. When you walk through fire, you won't be burnt or scorched by the flames."
Isaiah,43,3,"I am the LORD , your God, the Holy One of Israel, the God who saves you. I gave up Egypt, Ethiopia, and the region of Seba in exchange for you."
Isaiah,43,4,"To me, you are very dear, and I love you. That's why I gave up nations and people to rescue you."
Isaiah,43,5,Don't be afraid! I am with you. From both east and west I will bring you together.
Isaiah,43,6,"I will say to the north and to the south, “Free my sons and daughters! Let them return from distant lands."
Isaiah,43,7,They are my people— I created each of them to bring honour to me.”
Isaiah,43,8,"Bring my people together. They have eyes and ears, but they can't see or hear."
Isaiah,43,9,"Tell everyone of every nation to gather around. None of them can honestly say, “We told you so!” If someone heard them say this, then tell us about it now."

Isaiah,43,11,I alone am the LORD; only I can rescue you.
Isaiah,43,12,"I promised to save you, and I kept my promise. You are my witnesses that no other god did this. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Isaiah,43,13,I am God now and for ever. No one can snatch you from me or stand in my way.
Isaiah,43,14,"I, the LORD , will rescue you! I am Israel's holy God, and this is my promise: For your sake, I will send an army against Babylon to drag its people away, crying as they go."
Isaiah,43,15,"I am the LORD , your holy God, Israel's Creator and King."
Isaiah,43,16,I am the one who cut a path through the mighty ocean.
Isaiah,43,17,"I sent an army to chase you with chariots and horses; now they lie dead, unable to move. They are like an oil lamp with the flame snuffed out."
Isaiah,43,18,Forget what happened long ago! Don't think about the past.
Isaiah,43,19,"I am creating something new. There it is! Do you see it? I have put roads in deserts, streams in thirsty lands."
Isaiah,43,20,"Every wild animal honours me, even jackals and owls. I provide water in deserts— streams in thirsty lands for my chosen people."
Isaiah,43,21,"I made them my own nation, so they would praise me."
Isaiah,43,22,"I, the LORD , said to Israel: You have become weary, but not from worshipping me."
Isaiah,43,23,You have not honoured me by sacrificing sheep or other animals. And I have not burdened you with demands for sacrifices or sweet-smelling incense.
Isaiah,43,24,"You have not brought delicious spices for me or given me the best part of your sacrificed animals. Instead, you burden me down with your terrible sins."
Isaiah,43,25,"But I wipe away your sins because of who I am. And so, I will forget the wrongs you have done."
Isaiah,43,26,Meet me in court! State your case and prove that you are right.
Isaiah,43,27,Your earliest ancestor and all your leaders rebelled against me.
Isaiah,43,28,That's why I don't allow your priests to serve me; I let Israel be destroyed and your people disgraced.
Isaiah,44,1,"People of Israel, I have chosen you as my servant."
Isaiah,44,2,"I am your Creator. You were in my care even before you were born. Israel, don't be terrified! You are my chosen servant, my very favourite."
Isaiah,44,3,I will bless the thirsty land by sending streams of water; I will bless your descendants by giving them my Spirit.
Isaiah,44,4,They will spring up like grass or like willow trees near flowing streams.
Isaiah,44,5,They will worship me and become my people. They will write my name on the back of their hands.
Isaiah,44,6,"I am the LORD All-Powerful, the first and the last, the one and only God. Israel, I have rescued you! I am your King."
Isaiah,44,7,"Can anyone compare with me? If so, let them speak up and tell me now. Let them say what has happened since I made my nation long ago, and let them tell what is going to happen."
Isaiah,44,8,Don't tremble with fear! Didn't I tell you long ago? Didn't you hear me? I alone am God— no one else is a mighty rock.
Isaiah,44,9,"Those people who make idols are nothing themselves, and the idols they treasure are just as worthless. Worshippers of idols are blind, stupid, and foolish."
Isaiah,44,10,Why make an idol or an image that can't do a thing?
Isaiah,44,11,"Everyone who makes idols and all who worship them are mere humans, who will end up sadly disappointed. Let them face me in court and be terrified."
Isaiah,44,12,"A metalworker shapes an idol by using a hammer and heat from the fire. In his powerful hand he holds a hammer, as he pounds the metal into the proper shape. But he gets hungry and thirsty and loses his strength."
Isaiah,44,13,"Some woodcarver measures a piece of wood, then draws an outline. The idol is carefully carved with each detail exact. At last it looks like a person and is placed in a temple."
Isaiah,44,14,"Cedar, cypress, oak, or any tree from the forest may be chosen. Or even a pine tree planted by the woodcarver and watered by the rain."
Isaiah,44,15,"Some of the wood is used to make a fire for heating or for cooking. One piece is made into an idol, then the woodcarver bows down and worships it."
Isaiah,44,16,He enjoys the warm fire and the meat that was roasted over the burning coals.
Isaiah,44,17,"Afterwards, he bows down to worship the wooden idol. “Protect me!” he says. “You are my god.”"
Isaiah,44,18,Those who worship idols are stupid and blind!
Isaiah,44,19,"They don't have enough sense to say to themselves, “I made a fire with half of the wood and cooked my bread and meat on it. Then I made something worthless with the other half. Why worship a block of wood?”"
Isaiah,44,20,How can anyone be stupid enough to trust something that can be burnt to ashes? No one can save themselves like that. Don't they realize that the idols they hold in their hands are not really gods?
Isaiah,44,21,"People of Israel, you are my servant, so remember all of this. Israel, I created you, and you are my servant. I won't forget you."
Isaiah,44,22,Turn back to me! I have rescued you and swept away your sins as though they were clouds.
Isaiah,44,23,Tell the heavens and the earth to start singing! Tell the mountains and every tree in the forest to join in the song! The LORD has rescued his people; now they will worship him.
Isaiah,44,24,"Israel, I am your LORD. I am your source of life, and I have rescued you. I created everything from the sky above to the earth below."
Isaiah,44,25,I make liars of false prophets and fools of fortune-tellers. I take human wisdom and turn it into nonsense.
Isaiah,44,26,"I will make the message of my prophets come true. They are saying, “Jerusalem will be filled with people, and the LORD will rebuild the towns of Judah.”"
Isaiah,44,27,I am the one who commands the sea and its streams to run dry.
Isaiah,44,28,"I am also the one who says, “Cyrus will lead my people and obey my orders. Jerusalem and the temple will be rebuilt.”"
Isaiah,45,1,"The LORD said to Cyrus, his chosen one: I have taken hold of your right hand to help you capture nations and remove kings from power. City gates will open for you; not one will stay closed."
Isaiah,45,2,"As I lead you, I will level mountains and break the iron bars on bronze gates of cities."
Isaiah,45,3,"I will give you treasures hidden in dark and secret places. Then you will know that I, the LORD God of Israel, have called you by name."
Isaiah,45,4,"Cyrus, you don't even know me! But I have called you by name and highly honoured you because of Israel, my chosen servant."
Isaiah,45,5,"Only I am the LORD! There are no other gods. I have made you strong, though you don't know me."
Isaiah,45,6,Now everyone from east to west will learn that I am the LORD. No other gods are real.
Isaiah,45,7,"I create light and darkness, happiness and sorrow. I, the LORD , do all of this."
Isaiah,45,8,"Tell the heavens to send down justice like showers of rain. Prepare the earth for my saving power to sprout and produce justice that I, the LORD , create."
Isaiah,45,9,"Israel, you have no right to argue with your Creator. You are merely a clay pot shaped by a potter. The clay doesn't ask, “Why did you make me this way? Where are the handles?”"
Isaiah,45,10,"Children don't have the right to demand of their parents, “What have you done to make us what we are?”"
Isaiah,45,11,"I am the LORD , the Creator, the holy God of Israel. Do you dare question me about my own nation or about what I have done?"
Isaiah,45,12,I created the world and covered it with people; I stretched out the sky and filled it with stars.
Isaiah,45,13,"I have done the right thing by placing Cyrus in power, and I will make the roads easy for him to follow. I am the LORD All-Powerful! Cyrus will rebuild my city and set my people free without being paid a thing. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Isaiah,45,14,"My people, I, the LORD , promise that the riches of Egypt and the treasures of Ethiopia will belong to you. You will force into slavery those tall people of Seba. They will bow down and say, “The only true God is with you; there are no other gods.”"
Isaiah,45,15,"People of Israel, your God is a mystery, though he alone can save."
Isaiah,45,16,Anyone who makes idols will be confused and terribly disgraced.
Isaiah,45,17,"But Israel, I, the LORD, will always keep you safe and free from shame."
Isaiah,45,18,"The LORD alone is God! He created the heavens and made a world where people can live, instead of creating an empty desert. The LORD alone is God; there are no others."
Isaiah,45,19,"The LORD did not speak in a dark secret place or command Jacob's descendants to search for him in vain. The LORD speaks the truth, and this is what he says"
Isaiah,45,20,to every survivor from every nation: “Gather around me! Learn how senseless it is to worship wooden idols or pray to helpless gods.
Isaiah,45,21,"“Why don't you get together and meet me in court? Didn't I tell you long ago what would happen? I am the only God! There are no others. I bring about justice, and have the power to save."
Isaiah,45,22,“I invite the whole world to turn to me and be saved. I alone am God! No others are real.
Isaiah,45,23,"I have made a solemn promise, one that won't be broken: everyone will bow down and worship me."
Isaiah,45,24,They will admit that I alone can bring about justice. Everyone who is angry with me will be terribly ashamed and will turn to me.
Isaiah,45,25,"I, the LORD , will give victory and great honour to the people of Israel.”"
Isaiah,46,1,"The gods Bel and Nebo are down on their knees, as wooden images of them are carried away on weary animals."
Isaiah,46,2,"They are down on their knees to rescue the heavy load, but the images are still taken to a foreign country."
Isaiah,46,3,"You survivors in Israel, listen to me, the LORD. Since the day you were born, I have carried you along."
Isaiah,46,4,"I will still be the same when you are old and grey, and I will take care of you. I created you. I will carry you and always keep you safe."
Isaiah,46,5,Can anyone compare with me? Is anyone my equal?
Isaiah,46,6,Some people hire a goldsmith and give silver and gold to be formed into an idol for them to worship.
Isaiah,46,7,"They carry the idol on their shoulders, then put it on a stand, but it cannot move. They call out to the idol when they are in trouble, but it doesn't answer, and it cannot help."
Isaiah,46,8,"Now keep this in mind, you sinful people. And don't ever forget it."
Isaiah,46,9,I alone am God! There are no other gods; no one is like me. Think about what happened many years ago.
Isaiah,46,10,"From the very beginning, I told what would happen long before it took place. I kept my word"
Isaiah,46,11,"and brought someone from a distant land to do what I wanted. He attacked from the east, like a hawk swooping down. Now I will keep my promise and do what I planned."
Isaiah,46,12,"You people are stubborn and far from being safe, so listen to me."
Isaiah,46,13,I will soon come to save you. I am not far away and will waste no time; I take pride in Israel and will save Jerusalem.
Isaiah,47,1,"City of Babylon, you are delicate and untouched, but that will change. Surrender your royal power and sit in the dust."
Isaiah,47,2,Start grinding grain! Take off your veil. Strip off your fine clothes and cross over rivers.
Isaiah,47,3,"You will suffer the shame of going naked, because I will take revenge, and no one can escape."
Isaiah,47,4,"I am the LORD All-Powerful, the holy God of Israel. I am their Saviour."
Isaiah,47,5,"Babylon, be silent! Sit in the dark. No longer will nations accept you as their queen."
Isaiah,47,6,"I was angry with my people. So I let you take their land and bring disgrace on them. You showed them no mercy, but were especially cruel to those who were old."
Isaiah,47,7,You thought that you would be queen for ever. You didn't care what you did; it never entered your mind that you might get caught.
Isaiah,47,8,"You think that you alone are all-powerful, that you won't be a widow or lose your children. All you care about is pleasure, but listen to what I say."
Isaiah,47,9,"Your magic powers and charms will suddenly fail, then you will be a widow and lose your children."
Isaiah,47,10,"You hid behind evil like a shield and said, “No one can see me!” You were fooled by your wisdom and your knowledge; you felt sure that you alone were in full control."
Isaiah,47,11,"But without warning, disaster will strike— and your magic charms won't help at all."
Isaiah,47,12,Keep using your magic powers and your charms as you have always done. Perhaps—just perhaps— you will frighten somebody!
Isaiah,47,13,"You have worn yourself out, asking for advice from those who study the stars and tell the future month after month. Go and ask them how to be saved from what will happen."
Isaiah,47,14,"People who trust the stars are as helpless as straw in a flaming fire. No one can even keep warm, sitting by a fire that feeds only on straw."
Isaiah,47,15,"These are the fortune-tellers you have done business with all your life. But they don't know where they are going, and they can't save you."
Isaiah,48,1,"People of Israel, you come from Jacob's family and the tribe of Judah. You claim to worship me, the LORD God of Israel, but you are lying."
Isaiah,48,2,"You call Jerusalem your home and say you depend on me, the LORD All-Powerful, the God of Israel."
Isaiah,48,3,"Long ago I announced what was going to be, then without warning, I made it happen."
Isaiah,48,4,I knew you were stubborn and hard-headed.
Isaiah,48,5,"And I told you these things, so that when they happened you would not say, “The idols we worship did this.”"
Isaiah,48,6,"You heard what I said, and you have seen it happen. Now admit that it's true! I will show you secrets you have never known."
Isaiah,48,7,"Today I am doing something new, something you cannot say you have heard before."
Isaiah,48,8,"You have never been willing to listen to what I say; from the moment of your birth, I knew you would rebel."
Isaiah,48,9,"I, the LORD , am true to myself; I will be praised for not punishing and destroying you."
Isaiah,48,10,I tested you in hard times just as silver is refined in a heated furnace.
Isaiah,48,11,I did this because of who I am. I refuse to be dishonoured or share my praise with any other god.
Isaiah,48,12,"Israel, my chosen people, listen to me. I alone am the LORD, the first and the last."
Isaiah,48,13,With my own hand I created the earth and stretched out the sky. They obey my every command.
Isaiah,48,14,"Gather around me, all of you! Listen to what I say. Did any of your idols predict this would happen? Did they say that my friend would do what I want done to Babylonia?"
Isaiah,48,15,"I was the one who chose him. I have brought him this far, and he will be successful."
Isaiah,48,16,"Come closer and listen! I have never kept secret the things I have said, and I was here before time began. By the power of his Spirit the LORD God has sent me"
Isaiah,48,17,"with this message: People of Israel, I am the holy LORD God, the one who rescues you. For your own good, I teach you, and I lead you along the right path."
Isaiah,48,18,How I wish that you had obeyed my commands! Your success and good fortune would then have overflowed like a flooding river.
Isaiah,48,19,Your nation would be blessed with more people than there are grains of sand along the seashore. And I would never have let your country be destroyed.
Isaiah,48,20,"Now leave Babylon! Celebrate as you go. Be happy and shout for everyone to hear, “The LORD has rescued his servant Israel!"
Isaiah,48,21,He led us through the desert and made water flow from a rock to satisfy our thirst.
Isaiah,48,22,But the LORD has promised that none who are evil will live in peace.”
Isaiah,49,1,"Everyone, listen, even you foreign nations across the sea. The LORD chose me and gave me a name before I was born."
Isaiah,49,2,He made my words pierce like a sharp sword or a pointed arrow; he kept me safely hidden in the palm of his hand.
Isaiah,49,3,"The LORD said to me, “Israel, you are my servant; and because of you I will be highly honoured.”"
Isaiah,49,4,"I said to myself, “I'm completely worn out; my time has been wasted. But I did it for the LORD God, and he will reward me.”"
Isaiah,49,5,"Even before I was born, the LORD God chose me to serve him and to lead back the people of Israel. So the LORD has honoured me and made me strong."
Isaiah,49,6,"Now the LORD says to me, “It isn't enough for you to be merely my servant. You must do more than lead back survivors from the tribes of Israel. I have placed you here as a light for other nations; you must take my saving power to everyone on earth.”"
Isaiah,49,7,"Israel, I am the holy LORD God, the one who rescues you. You are slaves of rulers and of a nation who despises you. Now this is what I promise: kings and rulers will honour you by kneeling at your feet. You can trust me! I am your LORD, the holy God of Israel, and you are my chosen ones."
Isaiah,49,8,"This is what the LORD says: I will answer your prayers because I have set a time when I will help by coming to save you. I have chosen you to take my promise of hope to other nations. You will rebuild the country from its ruins, then people will come and settle there."
Isaiah,49,9,"You will set prisoners free from dark dungeons to see the light of day. On their way home, they will find plenty to eat, even on barren hills."
Isaiah,49,10,They won't go hungry or get thirsty; they won't be bothered by the scorching sun or hot desert winds. I will be merciful while leading them along to streams of water.
Isaiah,49,11,I will level the mountains and make roads.
Isaiah,49,12,Then my people will return from distant lands in the north and the west and from the city of Syene.
Isaiah,49,13,"Tell the heavens and the earth to celebrate and sing; command every mountain to join in the song. The LORD 's people have suffered, but he has shown mercy and given them comfort."
Isaiah,49,14,"The people of Zion said, “The LORD has turned away and forgotten us.”"
Isaiah,49,15,"The LORD answered, “Could a mother forget a child who nurses at her breast? Could she fail to love an infant who came from her own body? Even if a mother could forget, I will never forget you."
Isaiah,49,16,A picture of your city is drawn on my hand. You are always in my thoughts!
Isaiah,49,17,“Your city will be built faster than it was destroyed — those who attacked it will retreat and leave.
Isaiah,49,18,"Look around! You will see your people coming home. As surely as I live, I, the LORD , promise that your city with its people will be as lovely as a bride wearing her jewellery.”"
Isaiah,49,19,Jerusalem is now in ruins! Nothing is left of the city. But it will be rebuilt and soon overcrowded; its cruel enemies will be gone far away.
Isaiah,49,20,"Jerusalem is a woman whose children were born while she was in deep sorrow over the loss of her husband. Now those children will come and seek room in the crowded city,"
Isaiah,49,21,"and Jerusalem will ask, “Am I really their mother? How could I have given birth when I was still mourning in a foreign land? Who raised these children? Where have they come from?”"
Isaiah,49,22,The LORD God says: “I will soon give a signal for the nations to return your sons and your daughters to the arms of Jerusalem.
Isaiah,49,23,The kings and queens of those nations where they were raised will come and bow down. They will take care of you just like a slave taking care of a child. Then you will know that I am the LORD. You won't be disappointed if you trust me.”
Isaiah,49,24,Is it possible to rescue victims from someone strong and cruel?
Isaiah,49,25,But the LORD has promised to fight on our side and to rescue our children from those strong and violent enemies.
Isaiah,49,26,He will make those cruel people dine on their own flesh and get drunk from drinking their own blood. Then everyone will know that the LORD is our Saviour; the powerful God of Israel has rescued his people.
Isaiah,50,1,"The LORD says, “Children, I didn't divorce your mother or sell you to pay debts; I divorced her and sold you because of your sins."

Isaiah,51,15,"I will help them because I am your God, the LORD All-Powerful, who makes the ocean roar."

Isaiah,52,13,The LORD says: My servant will succeed! He will be given great praise and the highest honours.
Isaiah,52,14,Many were horrified at what happened to him. But everyone who saw him was even more horrified because he suffered until he no longer looked human.
Isaiah,52,15,My servant will make nations worthy to worship me; kings will be silent as they bow in wonder. They will see and think about things they have never seen or thought about before.
Isaiah,53,1,Has anyone believed us or seen the mighty power of the LORD in action?
Isaiah,53,2,"Like a young plant or a root that sprouts in dry ground, the servant grew up obeying the LORD. He wasn't some handsome king. Nothing about the way he looked made him attractive to us."

Isaiah,53,5,"He was wounded and crushed because of our sins; by taking our punishment, he made us completely well."
Isaiah,53,6,"All of us were like sheep that had wandered off. We had each gone our own way, but the LORD gave him the punishment we deserved."
Isaiah,53,7,"He was painfully abused, but he did not complain. He was silent like a lamb being led to the butcher, as quiet as a sheep having its wool cut off."

Isaiah,53,9,"He wasn't dishonest or violent, but he was buried in a tomb of cruel and rich people."

Isaiah,54,9,I once promised Noah that I would never again destroy the earth by a flood. Now I have promised that I will never again get angry and punish you.
Isaiah,54,10,Every mountain and hill may disappear. But I will always be kind and merciful to you; I won't break my agreement to give your nation peace.
Isaiah,54,11,"Jerusalem, you are sad and discouraged, tossed around in a storm. But I, the LORD, will rebuild your city with precious stones; for your foundation I will use blue sapphires."
Isaiah,54,12,"Your fortresses will be built of rubies, your gates of jewels, and your walls of gems."

Isaiah,54,14,You will be built on fairness with no fears of injustice; every one of your worries will be taken far from you.
Isaiah,54,15,"I will never send anyone to attack your city, and you will make prisoners of those who do attack."

Isaiah,56,2,I will bless everyone who respects the Sabbath and refuses to do wrong.

Isaiah,56,9,"Come from the forest, you wild animals! Attack and gobble up your victims."
Isaiah,56,10,"You leaders of Israel should be watchdogs, protecting my people. But you can't see a thing, and you never warn them. Dozing and daydreaming are all you ever do."
Isaiah,56,11,You stupid leaders are a pack of hungry and greedy dogs that never get enough. You are shepherds who ill-treat your own sheep for selfish gain.
Isaiah,56,12,"You say to each other, “Let's drink till we're drunk! Tomorrow we'll do it again. We'll really enjoy ourselves.”"
Isaiah,57,1,"God's faithful people are dragged off and killed, and no one even cares. Evil sweeps them away,"

Isaiah,57,3,"You people are unfaithful! You go to fortune-tellers, and you worship idols. Now pay close attention!"
Isaiah,57,4,Who are you making fun of? Who are you sneering at? Look how your sins have made fools of you.
Isaiah,57,5,All you think about is sex under those green trees where idols are worshipped. You sacrifice your children on altars built in valleys under rocky slopes.
Isaiah,57,6,You have chosen to worship idols made of stone; you have given them offerings of wine and grain. Should I be pleased?
Isaiah,57,7,"You have spread out your beds on the tops of high mountains, where you sacrifice to idols."
Isaiah,57,8,"Even in your homes you have placed pagan symbols all around your huge beds. Yes, you have rejected me, sold yourselves to your lovers, and gone to bed with them."
Isaiah,57,9,You smear on olive oil and all kinds of perfume to worship the god Molech. You even seek advice from spirits of the dead.
Isaiah,57,10,"Though you tired yourself out by running after idols, you refused to stop. Your desires were so strong that they kept you going."
Isaiah,57,11,Did you forget about me and become unfaithful because you were more afraid of someone else? Have I been silent so long that you no longer fear me?
Isaiah,57,12,"You think you're so good, but I'll point out the truth."
Isaiah,57,13,"Ask your idols to save you when you are in trouble. Be careful though— it takes only a faint breath to blow them over. But if you come to me for protection, this land and my holy mountain will always belong to you."
Isaiah,57,14,"The LORD says, “Clear the road! Get it ready for my people.”"

Isaiah,58,2,"Day after day, you worship him and seem eager to learn his teachings. You act like a nation that wants to do right by obeying his laws. You ask him about justice, and say you enjoy worshipping the LORD."
Isaiah,58,3,"You wonder why the LORD pays no attention when you go without eating and act humble. But on those same days that you give up eating, you think only of yourselves and abuse your workers."
Isaiah,58,4,You even get angry and ready to fight. No wonder God won't listen to your prayers!
Isaiah,58,5,Do you think the LORD wants you to give up eating and to act as humble as a bent over bush? Or to dress in sackcloth and sit in ashes? Is this really what he wants on a day of worship?
Isaiah,58,6,I'll tell you what it really means to worship the LORD. Remove the chains of prisoners who are chained unjustly. Free those who are abused!
Isaiah,58,7,Share your food with everyone who is hungry; share your home with the poor and homeless. Give clothes to those in need; don't turn away your relatives.
Isaiah,58,8,"Then your light will shine like the dawning sun, and you will quickly be healed. Your honesty will protect you as you advance, and the glory of the LORD will defend you from behind."
Isaiah,58,9,"When you beg the LORD for help, he will answer, “Here I am!” Don't ill-treat others or falsely accuse them or say something cruel."
Isaiah,58,10,Give your food to the hungry and care for the homeless. Then your light will shine in the dark; your darkest hour will be like the noonday sun.
Isaiah,58,11,The LORD will always guide you and provide good things to eat when you are in the desert. He will make you healthy. You will be like a garden that has plenty of water or like a stream that never runs dry.
Isaiah,58,12,You will rebuild those houses left in ruins for years; you will be known as a builder and repairer of city walls and streets.
Isaiah,58,13,"But first, you must start respecting the Sabbath as a joyful day of worship. You must stop doing and saying whatever you please on this special day."
Isaiah,58,14,Then you will truly enjoy knowing the LORD. He will let you rule from the highest mountains and bless you with the land of your ancestor Jacob. The LORD has spoken!
Isaiah,59,1,The LORD hasn't lost his powerful strength; he can still hear and answer prayers.
Isaiah,59,2,Your sins are the roadblock between you and your God. That's why he doesn't answer your prayers or let you see his face.
Isaiah,59,3,Your talk is filled with lies and plans for violence; every finger on your hands is covered with blood.
Isaiah,59,4,You falsely accuse others and tell lies in court; sin and trouble are the names of your children.
Isaiah,59,5,"You eat the deadly eggs of poisonous snakes, and more snakes crawl out from the eggs left to hatch. You weave spider's webs,"
Isaiah,59,6,but you can't make clothes with those webs or hide behind them. You're sinful and brutal.
Isaiah,59,7,You hurry off to do wrong or murder innocent victims. All you think about is sin; you leave ruin and destruction wherever you go.
Isaiah,59,8,You don't know how to live in peace or to be fair with others. The roads you make are crooked; your followers cannot find peace.
Isaiah,59,9,"No one has come to defend us or to bring about justice. We hoped for a day of sunshine, but all we found was a dark, gloomy night."
Isaiah,59,10,"We feel our way along, as if we were blind; we stumble at midday, as if it were night. We can see no better than someone dead."
Isaiah,59,11,"We growl like bears and mourn like doves. We hope for justice and victory, but they escape us."
Isaiah,59,12,"How often have we sinned and turned against you, the LORD God? Our sins condemn us! We have done wrong."
Isaiah,59,13,"We have rebelled and refused to follow you. Our hearts were deceitful, and so we lied; we planned to abuse others and turn our backs on you."
Isaiah,59,14,Injustice is everywhere; justice seems far away. Truth is chased out of court; honesty is shoved aside.
Isaiah,59,15,"Everyone tells lies; those who turn from crime end up ruined. When the LORD noticed that justice had disappeared, he became very displeased."
Isaiah,59,16,"It disgusted him even more to learn that no one would do a thing about it. So with his own powerful arm, he won victories for truth."
Isaiah,59,17,Justice was the LORD 's armour; saving power was his helmet; anger and revenge were his clothes.
Isaiah,59,18,"Now the LORD will get furious and do to his enemies, both near and far, what they did to his people."
Isaiah,59,19,He will attack like a flood in a mighty storm. Nations in the west and the east will then honour and praise his wonderful name.

Isaiah,60,7,Every sheep of Kedar will come to you; rams from Nebaioth will be yours as well. I will accept them as offerings and bring honour to my temple.
Isaiah,60,8,What is that sailing by like clouds or like doves flying home?

Isaiah,61,5,They will hire foreigners to take care of their sheep and their vineyards.

Isaiah,63,2,What are those red spots? Your clothes look stained from trampling on grapes.
Isaiah,63,3,“I alone trampled the grapes! None of the nations helped. I trampled nations in my anger and stained my clothes with their blood.
Isaiah,63,4,I did this because I wanted to take revenge— the time had come to rescue my people.
Isaiah,63,5,"No one was there to help me or to give support; my mighty arm won the battle, strengthened by my anger."
Isaiah,63,6,In my fury I trampled on nations and made them drunk; their blood poured out everywhere on earth.”
Isaiah,63,7,I will tell about the kind deeds the LORD has done. They deserve praise! The LORD has shown mercy to the people of Israel; he has been kind and good.
Isaiah,63,8,"The LORD rescued his people, and said, “They are mine. They won't betray me.”"
Isaiah,63,9,"It troubled the LORD to see them in trouble, and his angel saved them. The LORD was truly merciful, so he rescued his people. He took them in his arms and carried them all those years."
Isaiah,63,10,Then the LORD 's people turned against him and made his Holy Spirit sad. So he became their enemy and attacked them.
Isaiah,63,11,But his people remembered what had happened during the time of Moses. Didn't the LORD bring them and their leaders safely through the sea? Didn't he give them his Holy Spirit?
Isaiah,63,12,The glorious power of the LORD marched beside Moses. The LORD will be praised for ever for dividing the sea.
Isaiah,63,13,He led his people across like horses running wild without stumbling.
Isaiah,63,14,"His Spirit gave them rest, just as cattle find rest when led into a valley. The name of the LORD was praised for doing these things."
Isaiah,63,15,"Please, LORD , look down from your holy and glorious home in the heavens and see what's going on. Have you lost interest? Where is your power? Show that you care about us and have mercy!"
Isaiah,63,16,Our ancestors Abraham and Jacob have both rejected us. But you are still our Father; you have been our protector since ancient times.
Isaiah,63,17,"Why did you make us turn away from you, our LORD? Why did you make us want to disobey you? Please change your mind! We are your servants, your very own people."
Isaiah,63,18,"For a little while, your temple belonged to us; and now our enemies have torn it down."
Isaiah,63,19,We act as though you had never ruled us or called us your people.
Isaiah,64,1,"Rip the heavens apart! Come down, LORD; make the mountains tremble."
Isaiah,64,2,Be a spark that starts a fire causing water to boil. Then your enemies will know who you are; all nations will tremble because you are nearby.
Isaiah,64,3,Your fearsome deeds have completely amazed us; even the mountains shake when you come down.
Isaiah,64,4,You are the only God ever seen or heard of who works miracles for his followers.
Isaiah,64,5,"You help all who gladly obey and do what you want, but sin makes you angry. Only by your help can we ever be saved."
Isaiah,64,6,We are unfit to worship you; each of our good deeds is merely a filthy rag. We dry up like leaves; our sins are storm winds sweeping us away.
Isaiah,64,7,No one worships in your name or remains faithful. You have turned your back on us and let our sins melt us away.
Isaiah,64,8,"You, LORD , are our Father. We are nothing but clay, but you are the potter who moulded us."
Isaiah,64,9,Don't be so furious or keep our sins in your thoughts for ever! Remember that all of us are your people.
Isaiah,64,10,"Every one of your towns has turned into a desert, especially Jerusalem."
Isaiah,64,11,Zion's glorious and holy temple where our ancestors praised you has been destroyed by fire. Our beautiful buildings are now a pile of ruins.
Isaiah,64,12,"When you see these things, how can you just sit there and make us suffer more?"
Isaiah,65,1,"I, the LORD , was ready to answer even those who were not asking and to be found by those who were not searching. To a nation that refused to worship me, I said, “Here I am!”"
Isaiah,65,2,All day long I have reached out to stubborn and sinful people going their own way.
Isaiah,65,3,"They keep making me angry by sneering at me, while offering sacrifices to idols in gardens and burning incense to them on bricks."
Isaiah,65,4,"They spend their nights hiding in burial caves; they eat the meat of pigs, cooked in sauces made of stuff unfit to eat."
Isaiah,65,5,"And then they say to others, “Don't come near us! We're dedicated to God.” Such people are like smoke, irritating my nose all day."
Isaiah,65,6,I have written this down; I won't keep silent. I'll pay them back just as their sins deserve.
Isaiah,65,7,"I, the LORD , will make them pay for their sins and for those of their ancestors— they have disgraced me by burning incense on mountains."
Isaiah,65,8,"Here is what the LORD says: A cluster of grapes that produces wine is worth keeping! So, because of my servants, I won't destroy everyone."
Isaiah,65,9,"I have chosen the people of Israel and Judah, and I will bless them with many descendants. They will settle here in this land of mountains, and it will be theirs."
Isaiah,65,10,My people will worship me. Then the coastlands of Sharon and the land as far as Achor Valley will turn into pasture land where cattle and sheep will feed and rest.
Isaiah,65,11,"What will I, the LORD , do if any of you reject me and my holy mountain? What will happen to you for offering food and wine to the gods you call “Good Luck” and “Fate”?"
Isaiah,65,12,"Your luck will end! I will see to it that you are slaughtered with swords. You refused to answer when I called out; you paid no attention to my instructions. Instead, you did what I hated, knowing it was wrong."
Isaiah,65,13,"I, the LORD God, will give food and drink to my servants, and they will celebrate. But all of you sinners will go hungry and thirsty, overcome with disgrace."
Isaiah,65,14,"My servants will laugh and sing, but you will be sad and cry out in pain."
Isaiah,65,15,"I, the LORD God, promise to see that you are killed and that my chosen servants use your names as curse words. But I will give new names to my servants."
Isaiah,65,16,"I am God! I can be trusted. Your past troubles are gone; I no longer think of them. When you pray for someone to receive a blessing, or when you make a promise, you must do it in my name. I alone am the God who can be trusted."
Isaiah,65,17,I am creating new heavens and a new earth; everything of the past will be forgotten.
Isaiah,65,18,"Celebrate and be glad for ever! I am creating a Jerusalem, full of happy people."
Isaiah,65,19,I will celebrate with Jerusalem and all its people; there will be no more crying or sorrow in that city.
Isaiah,65,20,"No child will die in infancy; everyone will live to a ripe old age. Anyone a hundred years old will be considered young, and to die younger than that will be considered a curse."
Isaiah,65,21,My people will live in the houses they build; they will enjoy grapes from their own vineyards.
Isaiah,65,22,"No one will take away their homes or vineyards. My chosen people will live to be as old as trees, and they will enjoy what they have earned."
Isaiah,65,23,"Their work won't be wasted, and their children won't die of dreadful diseases. I will bless their children and their grandchildren."
Isaiah,65,24,I will answer their prayers before they finish praying.
Isaiah,65,25,"Wolves and lambs will graze together; lions and oxen will feed on straw. Snakes will eat only dust! They won't bite or harm anyone on my holy mountain. I, the LORD , have spoken!"
Isaiah,66,1,The LORD said: Heaven is my throne; the earth is my footstool. What kind of house could you build for me? In what place will I rest?
Isaiah,66,2,"I have made everything; that's how it all came to be. I, the LORD , have spoken. The people I treasure most are the humble— they depend only on me and tremble when I speak."
Isaiah,66,3,"You sacrifice oxen to me, and you commit murder; you sacrifice lambs to me and dogs to other gods; you offer grain to me and pigs' blood to idols; you burn incense to me and praise your idols. You have made your own choice to do these disgusting things that you enjoy so much."
Isaiah,66,4,"You refused to answer when I called out; you paid no attention to my instructions. Instead, you did what I hated, knowing it was wrong. Now I will punish you in a way you dread the most."
Isaiah,66,5,"If you tremble when the LORD speaks, listen to what he says: “Some of your own people hate and reject you because of me. They make fun and say, ‘Let the LORD show his power! Let us see him make you truly happy.’ But those who say these things will be terribly ashamed.”"
Isaiah,66,6,Do you hear that noise in the city and those shouts coming from the temple? It is the LORD shouting as he punishes his enemies.
Isaiah,66,7,Have you ever heard of a woman who gave birth to a child before having labour pains?
Isaiah,66,8,Who ever heard of such a thing or imagined it could happen? Can a nation be born in a day or come to life in a second? Jerusalem is like a mother who gave birth to her children as soon as she was in labour.
Isaiah,66,9,The LORD is the one who makes birth possible. And he will see that Zion has many more children. The LORD has spoken.
Isaiah,66,10,"If you love Jerusalem, celebrate and shout! If you were in sorrow because of the city, you can now be glad."
Isaiah,66,11,"She will nurse and comfort you, just like your own mother, until you are satisfied. You will fully enjoy her wonderful glory."
Isaiah,66,12,"The LORD has promised: “I will flood Jerusalem with the wealth of nations and make the city prosper. Zion will nurse you at her breast, carry you in her arms, and hold you in her lap."
Isaiah,66,13,I will comfort you there like a mother comforting her child.”
Isaiah,66,14,"When you see this happen, you will celebrate; your strength will return faster than grass can sprout. Then everyone will know that the LORD is present with his servants, but he is angry with his enemies."
Isaiah,66,15,The LORD will come down like a whirlwind with his flaming chariots. He will be terribly furious and punish his enemies with fire.
Isaiah,66,16,The LORD 's fiery sword will bring justice everywhere on this earth and execute many people.
Isaiah,66,17,"Some of you get yourselves ready and go to a garden to worship a foreign goddess. You eat the meat of pigs, lizards, and mice. But I, the LORD , will destroy you for this."
Isaiah,66,18,I know everything you do and think! The time has now come to bring together the people of every language and nation and to show them my glory
Isaiah,66,19,"by proving what I can do. I will send the survivors to Tarshish, Pul, Lud, Meshech, Tubal, Javan, and to the distant islands. I will send them to announce my wonderful glory to nations that have never heard about me."
Isaiah,66,20,"They will bring your relatives from the nations as an offering to me, the LORD . They will come on horses, chariots, wagons, mules, and camels to Jerusalem, my holy mountain. It will be like the people of Israel bringing the right offering to my temple."
Isaiah,66,21,"I promise that some of them will be priests and others will be helpers in my temple. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Isaiah,66,22,"I also promise that you will always have descendants and will never be forgotten, just as the new heavens and the new earth that I create will last for ever."
Isaiah,66,23,"On the first day of each month and on each Sabbath, everyone will worship me. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Isaiah,66,24,"My people will go out and look at the dead bodies of those who turned against me. The worms there never die, the fire never stops burning, and the sight of those bodies will be disgusting to everyone."
Jeremiah,1,1,"My name is Jeremiah. I am a priest, and my father Hilkiah and everyone else in my family are from Anathoth in the territory of the Benjamin tribe. This book contains the things that the LORD told me to say."
Jeremiah,1,2,"The LORD first spoke to me in the thirteenth year that Josiah was king of Judah,"
Jeremiah,1,3,and he continued to speak to me during the rule of Josiah's son Jehoiakim. The last time the LORD spoke to me was in the fifth month of the eleventh year that Josiah's son Zedekiah was king. That was also when the people of Jerusalem were taken away as prisoners.
Jeremiah,1,4,The LORD said:
Jeremiah,1,5,"“Jeremiah, I am your Creator, and before you were born, I chose you to speak for me to the nations.”"
Jeremiah,1,6,"I replied, “I'm not a good speaker, LORD , and I'm too young.”"
Jeremiah,1,7,"“Don't say you're too young,” the LORD answered. “If I tell you to go and speak to someone, then go! And when I tell you what to say, don't leave out a word!"
Jeremiah,1,8,"I promise to be with you and keep you safe, so don't be afraid.”"
Jeremiah,1,9,"The LORD reached out his hand, then he touched my mouth and said, “I am giving you the words to say,"
Jeremiah,1,10,"and I am sending you with authority to speak to the nations for me. You will tell them of doom and destruction, and of rising and rebuilding again.”"
Jeremiah,1,11,"The LORD showed me something in a vision. Then he asked, “What do you see, Jeremiah?” I answered, “A branch of almonds that ripen early.”"
Jeremiah,1,12,"“That's right,” the LORD replied, “and I always rise early to keep a promise.”"
Jeremiah,1,13,"Then the LORD showed me something else and asked, “What do you see now?” I answered, “I see a pot of boiling water in the north, and it's about to spill out towards us.”"
Jeremiah,1,14,The LORD said: I will pour out destruction all over the land.
Jeremiah,1,15,"Just watch while I send for the kings of the north. They will attack and capture Jerusalem and other towns, then set up their thrones at the gates of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,1,16,"I will punish my people, because they are guilty of turning from me to worship idols."
Jeremiah,1,17,"Jeremiah, get ready! Go and tell the people what I command you to say. Don't be frightened by them, or I will make you terrified while they watch."
Jeremiah,1,18,"My power will make you strong like a fortress or a column of iron or a wall of bronze. You will oppose all of Judah, including its kings and leaders, its priests and people."
Jeremiah,1,19,"They will fight back, but they won't win. I, the LORD , give my word— I won't let them harm you."
Jeremiah,2,1,The LORD told me
Jeremiah,2,2,"to go to Jerusalem and tell everyone that he had said: When you were my young bride, you loved me and followed me through the barren desert."
Jeremiah,2,3,"You belonged to me alone, like the first part of the harvest, and I severely punished those who ill-treated you."
Jeremiah,2,4,"Listen, people of Israel,"
Jeremiah,2,5,"and I, the LORD , will speak. I was never unfair to your ancestors, but they left me and became worthless by following worthless idols."
Jeremiah,2,6,"Your ancestors refused to ask for my help, though I had rescued them from Egypt and led them through a treacherous, barren desert, where no one lives or dares to travel."
Jeremiah,2,7,"I brought you here to my land, where food is abundant, but you made my land filthy with your sins."
Jeremiah,2,8,The priests who teach my laws don't care to know me. Your leaders rebel against me; your prophets give messages from Baal and worship false gods.
Jeremiah,2,9,I will take you to court and accuse you and your descendants
Jeremiah,3,1,"The LORD said to the people of Israel: If a divorced woman marries, can her first husband ever marry her again? No, because this would pollute the land. But you have more gods than a prostitute has lovers. Why should I take you back?"
Jeremiah,3,2,"Just try to find one hilltop where you haven't gone to worship other gods by having sex. You sat beside the road like a robber in ambush, except you offered yourself to every passer-by. Your sins of unfaithfulness have polluted the land."
Jeremiah,3,3,"So I, the LORD , refused to let the spring rains fall. But just like a prostitute, you still have no shame for what you have done."
Jeremiah,3,4,You call me your father or your long-lost friend;
Jeremiah,3,5,"you beg me to stop being angry, but you won't stop sinning."
Jeremiah,3,6,"When Josiah was king, the LORD said: Jeremiah, the kingdom of Israel was like an unfaithful wife who became a prostitute on the hilltops and in the shade of large trees."
Jeremiah,4,1,"The LORD said: Israel, if you really want to come back to me, get rid of those disgusting idols."
Jeremiah,4,2,"Make promises only in my name, and do what you promise! Then all nations will praise me, and I will bless them."
Jeremiah,4,3,"People of Jerusalem and Judah, don't be so stubborn! Your hearts have become hard, like unploughed ground where thorn bushes grow."
Jeremiah,4,4,"With all your hearts, keep the agreement I made with you. But if you are stubborn and keep on sinning, my anger will burn like a fire that cannot be put out."
Jeremiah,5,1,"“Search Jerusalem for honest people who try to be faithful. If you can find even one, I'll forgive the whole city."
Jeremiah,5,2,Everyone breaks promises made in my name.”
Jeremiah,5,3,"I answered, “I know that you look for truth. You punished your people for their lies, but in spite of the pain, they became more stubborn and refused to turn back to you.”"
Jeremiah,5,4,"Then I thought to myself, “These common people act like fools, and they have never learnt what the LORD their God demands of them."
Jeremiah,5,5,I'll go and talk to the leaders. They know what God demands.” But even they had decided not to obey the LORD.
Jeremiah,5,6,"The people have rebelled and rejected the LORD too many times. So enemies will attack like lions from the forest or wolves from the desert. Those enemies will watch the towns of Judah, and like leopards they will tear to pieces whoever goes outside."
Jeremiah,5,7,"People of Judah, how can I forgive you? I gave you everything, but you abandoned me and worshipped idols. You men go to prostitutes and are unfaithful to your wives."
Jeremiah,5,8,"You are no better than animals, and you always want sex with someone else's wife."
Jeremiah,5,9,Why shouldn't I punish the people of Judah?
Jeremiah,5,10,"I will tell their enemies, “Go through my vineyard. Don't destroy the vines, but cut off the branches, because they are the people who don't belong to me.”"
Jeremiah,5,11,"In every way, Judah and Israel have been unfaithful to me."
Jeremiah,6,1,"Run for your lives, people of Benjamin. Get out of Jerusalem. Sound a trumpet in Tekoa and light a signal fire in Beth-Haccherem. Soon you will be struck by disaster from the north."
Jeremiah,8,1,"Then the bones of the dead kings of Judah and their officials will be dug up, along with the bones of the priests, the prophets, and everyone else in Jerusalem"
Jeremiah,8,2,"who loved and worshipped the sun, moon, and stars. These bones will be scattered and left lying on the ground like rubbish, where the sun and moon and stars can shine on them."
Jeremiah,8,3,"Some of you people of Judah will be left alive, but I will force you to go to foreign countries, and you will wish you were dead. I, the LORD God All-Powerful, have spoken."
Jeremiah,8,4,"The LORD said: People of Jerusalem, when you stumble and fall, you get back up, and if you take a wrong road, you turn round and go back."
Jeremiah,8,5,So why do you refuse to come back to me? Why do you hold so tightly to your false gods?
Jeremiah,8,6,"I listen carefully, but none of you admit that you've done wrong. Without a second thought, you run down the wrong road like cavalry troops charging into battle."
Jeremiah,8,7,"Storks, doves, swallows, and thrushes all know when it's time to fly away for the winter and when to come back. But you, my people, don't know what I demand."
Jeremiah,8,8,"You say, “We are wise because we have the teachings and laws of the LORD .” But I say that your teachers have turned my words into lies!"
Jeremiah,8,9,"Your wise men have rejected what I say, and so they have no wisdom. Now they will be trapped and put to shame; they won't know what to do."
Jeremiah,8,10,"I'll give their wives and fields to strangers. Everyone is greedy and dishonest, whether poor or rich. Even the prophets and priests cannot be trusted."
Jeremiah,8,11,All they ever offer to my deeply wounded people are empty hopes for peace.
Jeremiah,8,12,"They should be ashamed of their disgusting sins, but they don't even blush. And so, when I punish Judah, they will end up on the ground, dead like everyone else."
Jeremiah,8,13,"I will wipe them out. They are vines without grapes; fig trees without figs or leaves. They have not done a thing that I told them! I, the LORD , have spoken."
Jeremiah,8,14,"The people of Judah say to each other, “What are we waiting for? Let's run to a town with walls and die there. We rebelled against the LORD, and we were sentenced to die by drinking poison."
Jeremiah,8,15,"We had hoped for peace and a time of healing, but all we got was terror."
Jeremiah,8,16,"Our enemies have reached the town of Dan in the north, and the snorting of their horses makes us tremble with fear. The enemy will destroy Jerusalem and our entire nation. No one will survive.”"
Jeremiah,8,17,"“Watch out!” the LORD says. “I'm sending poisonous snakes to attack you, and no one can stop them.”"
Jeremiah,8,18,I'm burdened with sorrow and feel like giving up.
Jeremiah,8,19,"In a foreign land my people are crying. Listen! You'll hear them say, “Has the LORD deserted Zion? Is he no longer its king?” I hear the LORD reply, “Why did you make me angry by worshipping useless idols?”"
Jeremiah,8,20,"The people complain, “Spring and summer have come and gone, but still the LORD hasn't rescued us.”"
Jeremiah,8,21,"My people are crushed, and so is my heart. I am horrified and mourn."
Jeremiah,8,22,"If medicine and doctors may be found in Gilead, why aren't my people healed?"
Jeremiah,9,1,"I wish that my eyes were fountains of tears, so I could cry day and night for my people who were killed."
Jeremiah,9,2,I wish I could go into the desert and find a hiding place from all who are treacherous and unfaithful to God.
Jeremiah,9,3,"The LORD replied: Lies come from the mouths of my people, like arrows from a bow. With each dishonest deed their power increases, and not one of them will admit that I am God."
Jeremiah,9,4,"Jeremiah, all your friends and relatives tell lies about you, so don't trust them."
Jeremiah,9,5,"They wear themselves out, always looking for a new way to cheat their friends."
Jeremiah,9,6,"Everyone takes advantage of everyone else, and no one will admit that I am God."
Jeremiah,9,7,And so I will purify the hearts of my people just as gold is purified in a furnace. I have no other choice.
Jeremiah,9,8,"They say they want peace, but this lie is deadly, like an arrow that strikes when you least expect it."
Jeremiah,9,9,"Give me one good reason not to punish them as they deserve. I, the LORD All-Powerful, have spoken."
Jeremiah,9,10,"I weep for the pasture land in the hill country. It's so barren and scorched that no one travels there. No cattle can be found there, and birds and wild animals have all disappeared."
Jeremiah,9,11,"I heard the LORD reply, “When I have finished, Jerusalem and the towns of Judah will be piles of ruins where only jackals live.”"
Jeremiah,9,12,"I said to the LORD , “None of us can understand why the land has become like an uncrossable desert. Won't you explain why?”"
Jeremiah,9,13,The LORD said: I destroyed the land because the people disobeyed me and rejected my laws and teachings.
Jeremiah,9,14,"They were stubborn and worshipped Baal, just as their ancestors did."
Jeremiah,9,15,"So I, the LORD All-Powerful, the God of Israel, promise them poison to eat and drink."
Jeremiah,9,16,"I'll scatter them in foreign countries that they and their ancestors have never even heard of. Finally, I will send enemy soldiers to kill every last one of them."
Jeremiah,9,17,"The LORD All-Powerful said, “Send for the women who are paid to weep at funerals, especially the women who can cry the loudest.”"
Jeremiah,9,18,"The people answered, “Let them come quickly and cry for us, until our own eyes are flooded with tears."
Jeremiah,9,19,"Now those of us on Zion cry, ‘We are ruined! We can't stand the shame. Our homes have been destroyed, and we must leave our land.’"
Jeremiah,9,20,“We ask you women to pay attention to what the LORD says. We will teach you a funeral song that you can teach your daughters and friends:
Jeremiah,9,21,"‘We were in our fortress, but death sneaked in through our windows. It even struck down children at play and our strongest young men.’"
Jeremiah,9,22,"“The LORD has told us the ground will be covered with dead bodies, like stalks of ungathered grain or like manure.”"
Jeremiah,9,23,The LORD says: Don't boast about your wisdom or strength or wealth.
Jeremiah,9,24,"If you feel you must boast, then have enough sense to boast about worshipping me, the LORD. What I like best is showing kindness, justice, and mercy to everyone on earth."
Jeremiah,12,1,"Whenever I complain to you, LORD, you are always fair. But now I have questions about your justice. Why is life easy for sinners? Why are they successful?"
Jeremiah,12,2,"You plant them like trees; you let them prosper and produce fruit. Yet even when they praise you, they don't mean it."
Jeremiah,12,3,"But you know, LORD, how faithful I've always been, even in my thoughts. So drag my enemies away and butcher them like sheep!"
Jeremiah,12,4,"How long will the ground be dry and the pasture lands parched? The birds and animals are dead and gone. And all this happened because the people are so sinful. They even boast, “God can't see the sins we commit.”"
Jeremiah,12,5,"Jeremiah, if you get tired in a race against people, how can you possibly run against horses? If you fall in open fields, what will happen in the forest along the River Jordan?"
Jeremiah,12,6,"Even your own family has turned against you. They act friendly, but don't trust them. They're out to get you, and so is everyone else."
Jeremiah,12,7,I loved my people and chose them as my very own. But now I will reject them and hand them over to their enemies.
Jeremiah,12,8,My people have turned against me and roar at me like lions. That's why I hate them.
Jeremiah,12,9,My people are like a hawk surrounded and attacked by other hawks. Tell the wild animals to come and eat their fill.
Jeremiah,12,10,My beautiful land is ruined like a field or a vineyard trampled by shepherds and stripped bare by their flocks.
Jeremiah,12,11,"Every field I see lies barren, and no one cares."
Jeremiah,12,12,A destroying army marches along desert roads and attacks everywhere. They are my deadly sword; no one is safe from them.
Jeremiah,12,13,"My people, you planted wheat, but because I was furious, I let only weeds grow. You wore yourselves out for nothing!"
Jeremiah,12,14,"The LORD said: I gave this land to my people Israel, but enemies around it have attacked and robbed it. So I will uproot them from their own countries just as I will uproot Judah from its land."
Jeremiah,12,15,"But later, I will have pity on these nations and bring them back to their own lands."
Jeremiah,12,16,"They once taught my people to worship Baal. But if they admit I am the only true God, and if they let my people teach them how to worship me, these nations will also become my people."
Jeremiah,12,17,"However, if they don't listen to me, I will uproot them from their lands and completely destroy them. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Jeremiah,13,1,"The LORD told me, “Go and buy a pair of linen shorts. Wear them for a while, but don't wash them.”"
Jeremiah,13,2,So I bought a pair of shorts and put them on.
Jeremiah,13,3,"Then the LORD said,"
Jeremiah,13,4,“Take off the shorts. Go to Parah and hide the shorts in a crack between some large rocks.”
Jeremiah,13,5,And that's what I did.
Jeremiah,13,6,"Some time later the LORD said, “Go back and get the shorts.”"
Jeremiah,13,7,"I went back and dug the shorts out of their hiding place, but the cloth had rotted, and the shorts were ruined."
Jeremiah,13,8,Then the LORD said:
Jeremiah,13,9,"Jeremiah, I will use Babylonia to destroy the pride of the people of Judah and Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,13,10,"The people of Judah are evil and stubborn. So instead of listening to me, they do whatever they want and even worship other gods. When I have finished with these people, they will be good for nothing, just like this pair of shorts."
Jeremiah,13,11,"These shorts were tight around your waist, and that's how tightly I held on to the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. I wanted them to be my people. I wanted to make them famous, so that other nations would praise and honour me, but they refused to obey me."
Jeremiah,13,12,"Jeremiah, tell the people of Judah, “The LORD God of Israel orders you to fill your wine jars with wine.” They will answer, “Of course we fill our wine jars with wine! Why are you telling us something we already know?”"
Jeremiah,13,13,"Then say to them: I am the LORD , and what I'm going to do will make everyone in Judah and Jerusalem appear to be full of wine. And the worst ones will be the kings of David's family and the priests and the prophets."
Jeremiah,13,14,"Then I will smash them against each other like jars. I will have no pity on the young or the old, and they will all be destroyed. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Jeremiah,13,15,"People of Judah, don't be too proud to listen to what the LORD has said."
Jeremiah,13,16,"You hope for light, but God is sending darkness. Evening shadows already deepen in the hills. So return to God and confess your sins to him before you trip and fall."
Jeremiah,13,17,"If you are too proud to listen, I will weep alone. Tears will stream from my eyes when the LORD 's people are taken away as prisoners."
Jeremiah,13,18,The LORD told me to tell you that your king and his mother must surrender their thrones and remove their crowns.
Jeremiah,13,19,The cities in the Southern Desert are surrounded; no one can get in or out. Everyone in Judah will be taken away.
Jeremiah,13,20,"Jerusalem, you were so proud of ruling the people of Judah. But where are they now? Look north, and you will see your enemies approaching."
Jeremiah,13,21,"You once trusted them to help, but now I'll let them rule you. What do you say about that? You will be in pain like a woman giving birth."
Jeremiah,13,22,Do you know why your clothes were torn off and you were abused? It was because of your terrible sins.
Jeremiah,13,23,"Can you ever change and do what's right? Can people change the colour of their skin, or can a leopard remove its spots? If so, then perhaps you can change and learn to do right."
Jeremiah,13,24,"I will scatter you, just as the desert wind blows husks from grain tossed in the air."
Jeremiah,13,25,"I won't change my mind. I, the LORD , have spoken. You rejected me and worshipped false gods."
Jeremiah,14,1,"When there had been no rain for a long time, the LORD told me to say to the people:"
Jeremiah,14,2,Judah and Jerusalem weep as the land dries up.
Jeremiah,14,3,Rulers send their servants to the storage pits for water. But there's none to be found; they return in despair with their jars still empty.
Jeremiah,14,4,"There has been no rain, and farmers feel sick as they watch cracks appear in the dry ground."
Jeremiah,14,5,"A deer gives birth in a field, then abandons her newborn fawn and leaves in search of grass."
Jeremiah,14,6,"Wild donkeys go blind from starvation. So they stand on barren hilltops and sniff the air, hoping to smell green grass."
Jeremiah,14,7,"Our terrible sins may demand that we be punished. But if you rescue us, LORD, everyone will see how great you are."
Jeremiah,14,8,"You're our only hope; you alone can save us now. You help us one day, but you're gone the next."
Jeremiah,14,9,"Did this disaster take you by surprise? Are you a warrior with your hands tied? You have chosen us, and your temple is here. Don't abandon us!"
Jeremiah,14,10,"My people, you love to wander away; you don't even try to stay close to me. So now I will reject you and punish you for your sins. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Jeremiah,14,11,"The LORD said, “Jeremiah, don't ask me to help these people."
Jeremiah,14,12,"They may even go without eating and offer sacrifices to please me and to give thanks. But when they cry out for my help, I won't listen, and I won't accept their sacrifices. Instead, I'll send war, starvation, and disease to wipe them out.”"
Jeremiah,14,13,"I replied, “The other prophets keep telling everyone that you won't send starvation or war, and that you're going to give us peace.”"
Jeremiah,14,14,"The LORD answered: They claim to speak for me, but they're lying! I didn't even speak to them, much less choose them to be my prophets. Their messages come from worthless dreams, useless fortune-telling, and their own imaginations."
Jeremiah,14,15,Those lying prophets say there will be peace and plenty of food. But I say that those same prophets will die from war and hunger.
Jeremiah,14,16,"And everyone who listens to them will be killed, just as they deserve. Their dead bodies will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem, because their families will also be dead, and no one will be left to bury them."
Jeremiah,14,17,"Jeremiah, go and tell the people how you feel about all this. So I told them: “Tears will flood my eyes both day and night, because my nation suffers from a deadly wound."
Jeremiah,14,18,"In the fields I see the bodies of those killed in battle. And in the towns I see crowds dying of hunger. But the prophets and priests go about their business, without understanding what has happened.”"
Jeremiah,14,19,"Have you rejected Judah, LORD? Do you hate Jerusalem? Why did you strike down Judah with a fatal wound? We had hoped for peace and a time of healing, but all we got was terror."
Jeremiah,14,20,We and our ancestors are guilty of rebelling against you.
Jeremiah,14,21,"If you save us, it will show how great you are. Don't let our enemies disgrace your temple, your beautiful throne. Don't forget that you promised to rescue us."
Jeremiah,14,22,"Idols can't send rain, and showers don't fall by themselves. Only you control the rain, so we put our trust in you, the LORD our God."
Jeremiah,15,1,"The LORD said to me: Even if Moses and Samuel were here, praying with you, I wouldn't change my mind. So send the people of Judah away."
Jeremiah,15,2,"And when they ask where they are going, tell them that I, the LORD , have said: Some of you are going to die of horrible diseases. Others are going to die in war or from starvation. The rest will be led away to a foreign country."
Jeremiah,15,3,"I will punish you in four different ways: You will be killed in war and your bodies dragged off by dogs, your flesh will be eaten by birds, and your bones will be chewed on by wild animals."
Jeremiah,15,4,This punishment will happen because of the horrible things your King Manasseh did. And you will be disgusting to all nations on earth.
Jeremiah,15,5,"People of Jerusalem, who will feel sorry for you? Will anyone bother to ask if you are well?"
Jeremiah,15,6,"My people, you abandoned me and walked away. I am tired of showing mercy; that's why I'll destroy you"
Jeremiah,15,7,"by scattering you like straw blown by the wind. I will punish you with sorrow and death, because you refuse to change your ways."
Jeremiah,15,8,There will be more widows in Judah than grains of sand on a beach. A surprise attack at midday! And the mothers in Jerusalem mourn for their children.
Jeremiah,15,9,"A mother is in deep despair and struggles for breath. Her daylight has turned to darkness— she has suffered the loss of her seven sons. I will kill anyone who survives. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Jeremiah,15,10,"I wish I had never been born! I'm always in trouble with everyone in Judah. I never lend or borrow money, but everyone curses me just the same."
Jeremiah,15,11,"Then the LORD replied, “I promise to protect you, and when disaster comes, even your enemies will beg you for help.”"
Jeremiah,15,12,"People of Judah, just as you can't break iron mixed with bronze, you can't defeat the enemies who will attack from the north."
Jeremiah,15,13,"I will give them everything you own, because you have sinned everywhere in your country."
Jeremiah,15,14,"My anger is a fire that cannot be put out, so I will make you slaves of your enemies in a foreign land."
Jeremiah,15,15,"You can see how I suffer insult after insult, all because of you, LORD. Don't be so patient with my enemies; take revenge on them before they kill me."
Jeremiah,15,16,"When you spoke to me, I was glad to obey, because I belong to you, the LORD All-Powerful."
Jeremiah,15,17,"I don't go to parties and have a good time. Instead, I keep to myself, because you have filled me with your anger."
Jeremiah,15,18,"I am badly injured and in constant pain. Are you going to disappoint me, like a stream that goes dry in the heat of summer?"
Jeremiah,15,19,"Then the LORD told me: Stop talking like a fool! If you turn back to me and speak my message, I will let you be my prophet once again. I hope the people of Judah will accept what you say. But you can ignore their threats,"
Jeremiah,16,1,The LORD said to me:
Jeremiah,16,2,"Jeremiah, don't get married and have children—Judah is no place to raise a family."
Jeremiah,16,3,I'll tell you what's going to happen to children and their parents here.
Jeremiah,16,4,"They will die of horrible diseases and of war and starvation. No one will give them a funeral or bury them, and their bodies will be food for the birds and wild animals. And what's left will lie on the ground like manure."
Jeremiah,16,5,"When someone dies, don't visit the family or show any sorrow. I will no longer love or bless or have any pity on the people of Judah."
Jeremiah,16,6,Rich and poor alike will die and be left unburied. No one will mourn and show their sorrow by cutting themselves or shaving their heads.
Jeremiah,16,7,No one will bring food and wine to help comfort those who are mourning the death of their father or mother.
Jeremiah,16,8,Don't even set foot in a house where there is eating and drinking and celebrating.
Jeremiah,16,9,"Warn the people of Judah that I, the LORD All-Powerful, will put an end to all their parties and wedding celebrations."
Jeremiah,16,10,"They will ask, “Why has the LORD our God threatened us with so many disasters? Have we done something wrong or sinned against him?”"
Jeremiah,16,11,"Then tell them I have said: People of Judah, your ancestors turned away from me; they rejected my laws and teachings and started worshipping other gods."
Jeremiah,16,12,"And you have done even worse! You are stubborn, and instead of obeying me, you do whatever evil comes to your mind."
Jeremiah,16,13,"So I will throw you into a land that you and your ancestors know nothing about, a place where you will have to worship other gods both day and night. And I won't feel the least bit sorry for you."
Jeremiah,16,14,A time will come when you will again worship me. But you will no longer call me the Living God who rescued Israel from Egypt.
Jeremiah,16,15,"Instead, you will call me the Living God who rescued you from that country in the north and from the other countries where I had forced you to go. Some day I will bring you back to this land that I gave your ancestors."
Jeremiah,16,16,"But for now, I am sending enemies who will catch you like fish and hunt you down like wild animals in the hills and the caves."
Jeremiah,16,17,"I can see everything you are doing, even if you try to hide your sins from me."
Jeremiah,16,18,"I will punish you double for your sins, because you have made my own land disgusting. You have filled it with lifeless idols that remind me of dead bodies."
Jeremiah,16,19,"Our LORD , you are the one who gives me strength and protects me like a fortress when I am in trouble. People will come to you from distant nations and say, “Our ancestors worshipped false and useless gods,"
Jeremiah,16,20,worthless idols made by human hands.”
Jeremiah,16,21,"Then the LORD replied, “That's why I will teach them about my power, and they will know that I am the true God.”"
Jeremiah,17,1,"People of Judah, your sins cannot be erased. They are written on your hearts like words chiselled in stone or carved on the corners of your altars."
Jeremiah,18,1,"The LORD told me,"
Jeremiah,18,2,"“Go to the pottery shop, and when you get there, I will tell you what to say to the people.”"
Jeremiah,18,3,I went there and saw the potter making clay pots on his pottery wheel.
Jeremiah,18,4,"And whenever the clay would not take the shape he wanted, he would change his mind and form it into some other shape."
Jeremiah,18,5,Then the LORD told me to say:
Jeremiah,18,6,"People of Israel, I, the LORD , have power over you, just as a potter has power over clay."
Jeremiah,18,7,If I threaten to uproot and shatter an evil nation
Jeremiah,18,8,"and that nation turns from its evil, I will change my mind."
Jeremiah,18,9,"If I promise to make a nation strong,"
Jeremiah,18,10,"but its people start disobeying me and doing evil, then I will change my mind and not help them at all."
Jeremiah,18,11,"So listen to me, people of Judah and Jerusalem! I have decided to strike you with disaster, and I won't change my mind unless you stop sinning and start living right."
Jeremiah,18,12,"But I know you won't listen. You might as well answer, “We don't care what you say. We have made plans to sin, and we are going to be stubborn and do what we want!”"
Jeremiah,18,13,"So I, the LORD , command you to ask the nations, and find out if they have ever heard of such a horrible sin as what you have done."
Jeremiah,18,14,"The snow on Lebanon's mountains never melts away, and the streams there never run dry."
Jeremiah,18,15,"But you, my people, have turned from me to burn incense to worthless idols. You have left the ancient road to follow an unknown path where you stumble over idols."
Jeremiah,18,16,"Your land will be ruined, and every passer-by will look at it with horror and make insulting remarks."
Jeremiah,18,17,"When your enemies attack, I will scatter you like dust blown by an eastern wind. Then, on that day of disaster, I will turn my back on you."
Jeremiah,18,18,"Some of the people said, “Let's get rid of Jeremiah! We will always have priests to teach us God's laws, as well as wise people to give us advice, and prophets to speak the LORD 's messages. So, instead of listening to Jeremiah any longer, let's accuse him of a crime.”"
Jeremiah,18,19,"Please, LORD , answer my prayer. Make my enemies stop accusing me of evil."
Jeremiah,18,20,"I tried to help them, but they are paying me back by digging a pit to trap me. I even begged you not to punish them."
Jeremiah,18,21,But now I am asking you to let their children starve or be killed in war. Let women lose their husbands and sons to disease and violence.
Jeremiah,18,22,"These people have dug pits and set traps for me, LORD. Make them scream in fear when you send enemy troops to attack their homes."
Jeremiah,18,23,You know they plan to kill me. So get angry and punish them! Don't ever forgive their terrible crimes.
Jeremiah,19,1,"The LORD said: Jeremiah, go to the pottery shop and buy a clay jar. Then take along some of the city officials and leading priests"
Jeremiah,19,2,"and go to Hinnom Valley, just outside Potsherd Gate. Tell the people that I have said:"
Jeremiah,19,3,"I am the LORD All-Powerful, the God of Israel, and you kings of Judah and you people of Jerusalem had better pay attention. I am going to bring so much trouble on this valley that everyone who hears about it will be shocked."
Jeremiah,20,1,"Pashhur son of Immer was a priest and the chief of temple security. He heard what I had said,"
Jeremiah,20,2,and so he hit me. Then he had me arrested and put in chains at the Benjamin Gate in the LORD 's temple.
Jeremiah,20,3,"The next day, when Pashhur let me go free, I told him that the LORD had said: No longer will I call you Pashhur. Instead, I will call you Afraid-of-Everything."
Jeremiah,20,4,"You will be afraid, and you will bring fear to your friends as well. You will see enemies kill them in battle. Then I will make the king of Babylonia take everyone in Judah prisoner, killing some and dragging the rest away to Babylonia."
Jeremiah,20,5,He will clean out the royal treasury and take everything else of value from Jerusalem.
Jeremiah,20,6,"Pashhur, you are guilty of telling lies and claiming they were messages from me. That's why I will make the Babylonians take you, your family, and your friends as prisoners to Babylonia, where you will all die and be buried."
Jeremiah,20,7,"You tricked me, LORD, and I was really fooled. You are stronger than I am, and you have defeated me. People never stop sneering and insulting me."
Jeremiah,20,8,You have let me announce only destruction and death. Your message has brought me nothing but insults and trouble.
Jeremiah,20,9,"Sometimes I tell myself not to think about you, LORD, or even mention your name. But your message burns in my heart and bones, and I cannot keep silent."
Jeremiah,20,10,"I heard the crowds whisper, “Everyone is afraid. Now's our chance to accuse Jeremiah!” All of my so called friends are just waiting for me to make a mistake. They say, “Perhaps Jeremiah can be tricked. Then we can overpower him and get even at last.”"
Jeremiah,20,11,"But you, LORD, are a mighty soldier, standing at my side. Those troublemakers will fall down and fail— terribly embarrassed, for ever ashamed."
Jeremiah,20,12," LORD All-Powerful, you test those who do right, and you know every heart and mind. I have told you my complaints, so let me watch you take revenge on my enemies."
Jeremiah,20,13,"I sing praises to you, LORD. You rescue the oppressed from the wicked."
Jeremiah,20,14,Put a curse on the day I was born! Don't bless my mother.
Jeremiah,20,15,"Put a curse on the man who told my father, “Good news! You have a son.”"
Jeremiah,20,16,May that man be like the towns you destroyed without pity. Let him hear shouts of alarm in the morning and battle cries at midday.
Jeremiah,20,17,He deserves to die for not killing me before I was born. Then my mother's body would have been my grave.
Jeremiah,20,18,Why did I have to be born? Was it just to suffer and die in shame?
Jeremiah,21,1,"King Zedekiah of Judah sent for Pashhur son of Malchiah and for a priest named Zephaniah son of Maaseiah. Then he told them, “Talk with Jeremiah for me.” So they came to me and said,"
Jeremiah,21,2,"“King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia has attacked Judah. Please ask the LORD to work miracles for our people, as he has done in the past, so that Nebuchadnezzar will leave us alone.”"
Jeremiah,23,1,You leaders of my people are like shepherds that kill and scatter the sheep.
Jeremiah,23,2,"You were supposed to take care of my people, but instead you chased them away. So now I'll really take care of you, and believe me, you will pay for your crimes!"
Jeremiah,23,3,"I will bring the rest of my people home from the lands where I have scattered them, and they will grow into a mighty nation."
Jeremiah,23,4,"I promise to choose leaders who will care for them like real shepherds. All my people will be there, and they will never again be frightened."
Jeremiah,23,5,"Some day I will appoint an honest king from the family of David, a king who will be wise and rule with justice."
Jeremiah,23,6,"As long as he is king, Israel will have peace, and Judah will be safe. The name of this king will be “The LORD Gives Justice”."
Jeremiah,23,7,A time will come when you will again worship me. But you will no longer call me the Living God who rescued Israel from Egypt.
Jeremiah,23,8,"Instead, you will call me the Living God who rescued you from the land in the north and from all the other countries where I had forced you to go. And you will once again live in your own land."
Jeremiah,23,9,"When I think of the prophets, I am shocked, and I tremble like someone drunk, because of the LORD and his sacred words."
Jeremiah,23,10,Those unfaithful prophets misuse their power all over the country. So God turned the pasture lands into scorching deserts.
Jeremiah,23,11,"The LORD told me to say: You prophets and priests think so little of me, the LORD, that you even sin in my own temple!"
Jeremiah,23,12,"Now I will punish you with disaster, and you will slip and fall in the darkness. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Jeremiah,23,13,"The prophets in Samaria were disgusting to me, because they preached in the name of Baal and led my people astray."
Jeremiah,23,14,And you prophets in Jerusalem are even worse. You're unfaithful in marriage and never tell the truth. You even lead others to sin instead of helping them turn back to me. You and the people of Jerusalem are evil like Sodom and Gomorrah.
Jeremiah,23,15,"You prophets in Jerusalem have spread evil everywhere. That's why I, the LORD , promise to give you bitter poison to eat and drink."
Jeremiah,23,16,"Don't listen to the lies of these false prophets, you people of Judah! The message they preach is something they imagined; it did not come from me, the LORD All-Powerful."
Jeremiah,23,17,"These prophets go to people who refuse to respect me and who are stubborn and do whatever they want. The prophets tell them, “The LORD has promised everything will be fine.”"
Jeremiah,23,18,"But I, the LORD , tell you that these prophets have never attended a meeting of my council in heaven or heard me speak."
Jeremiah,23,19,They are evil! So in my anger I will strike them like a violent storm.
Jeremiah,23,20,"I won't calm down, until I have finished what I have decided to do. Some day you will understand exactly what I mean."
Jeremiah,23,21,"I did not send these prophets or speak to them, but they ran to find you and to preach their message."
Jeremiah,23,22,"If they had been in a meeting of my council in heaven, they would have told you people of Judah to give up your sins and come back to me."
Jeremiah,23,23,"I am everywhere— both near and far,"
Jeremiah,23,24,in heaven and on earth. There are no secret places where you can hide from me.
Jeremiah,23,25,"These unfaithful prophets claim that I have given them a dream or a vision, and then they tell lies in my name."
Jeremiah,23,26,But everything they say comes from their own twisted minds. How long can this go on?
Jeremiah,23,27,"They tell each other their dreams and try to get my people to reject me, just as their ancestors left me and worshipped Baal."
Jeremiah,23,28,"Their dreams and my truth are as different as straw and wheat. But when prophets speak for me, they must say only what I have told them."
Jeremiah,23,29,My words are a powerful fire; they are a hammer that shatters rocks.
Jeremiah,24,1,"The LORD spoke to me in a vision after King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia had come to Judah and taken King Jehoiachin, his officials, and all the skilled workers back to Babylonia. In this vision I saw two baskets of figs in front of the LORD 's temple."
Jeremiah,24,2,"One basket was full of very good figs that ripened early, and the other was full of rotten figs that were not fit to eat."
Jeremiah,24,3,"“Jeremiah,” the LORD asked, “what do you see?” “Figs,” I said. “Some are very good, but the others are too rotten to eat.”"
Jeremiah,24,4,Then the LORD told me to say:
Jeremiah,24,5,"People of Judah, the good figs stand for those of you I sent away as exiles to Babylonia,"
Jeremiah,24,6,"where I am watching over them. Then some day I will bring them back to this land. I will plant them, instead of uprooting them, and I will build them up, rather than tearing them down."
Jeremiah,24,7,"I will give them a desire to know me and to be my people. They will want me to be their God, and they will turn back to me with all their heart."
Jeremiah,24,8,"The rotten figs stand for King Zedekiah of Judah, his officials, and all the others who were not taken away to Babylonia, whether they stayed here in Judah or went to live in Egypt."
Jeremiah,24,9,"I will punish them with a terrible disaster, and everyone on earth will tremble when they hear about it. I will force the people of Judah to go to foreign countries, where they will be cursed and insulted."
Jeremiah,24,10,"War and hunger and disease will strike them, until they finally disappear from the land that I gave them and their ancestors."
Jeremiah,26,1,"Soon after Jehoiakim became king of Judah, the LORD said:"
Jeremiah,26,2,"Jeremiah, I have a message for everyone who comes from the towns of Judah to worship in my temple. Go to the temple courtyard and speak every word that I tell you."
Jeremiah,26,3,"Perhaps the people will listen this time. And if they stop doing wrong, I will change my mind and not punish them for their sins."
Jeremiah,26,4,Tell them that I have said: You have refused to listen to me and to obey my laws and teachings.
Jeremiah,26,5,"Again and again I have sent my servants the prophets to preach to you, but you ignored them as well. Now I am warning you that if you don't start obeying me straight away,"
Jeremiah,26,6,"I will destroy this temple, just as I destroyed the town of Shiloh. Then everyone on earth will use the name “Jerusalem” as a curse word."
Jeremiah,26,7,"The prophets, the priests, and everyone else in the temple heard what I said,"
Jeremiah,28,1,"Later that same year, in the fifth month of the fourth year that Zedekiah was king, the prophet Hananiah son of Azzur from Gibeon came up to me in the temple. And while the priests and others in the temple were listening,"
Jeremiah,28,2,"he told me that the LORD had said: I am the LORD All-Powerful, the God of Israel, and I will smash the yoke that Nebuchadnezzar put on the necks of the nations to make them his slaves."
Jeremiah,28,3,"And within two years, I will bring back to Jerusalem everything that he took from my temple and carried off to Babylonia."
Jeremiah,28,4,King Jehoiachin and the other people who were taken from Judah to Babylonia will be allowed to come back here as well. All this will happen because I will smash the power of the king of Babylonia!
Jeremiah,28,5,"The priests and the others were still standing there, so I said:"
Jeremiah,28,6,"Hananiah, I hope the LORD will do exactly what you said. I hope he does bring back everything the Babylonians took from the temple, and that our people who were taken to Babylonia will be allowed to return home."
Jeremiah,28,7,But let me remind you and everyone else
Jeremiah,28,8,"that long before we were born, prophets were saying powerful kingdoms would be struck by war, disaster, and disease."
Jeremiah,28,9,Now you are saying we will have peace. We will just have to wait and see if that is really what the LORD has said.
Jeremiah,28,10,Hananiah grabbed the wooden yoke from my neck and smashed it.
Jeremiah,28,11,"Then he said, “The LORD says this is the way he will smash the power Nebuchadnezzar has over the nations, and it will happen in less than two years.” I left the temple,"
Jeremiah,28,12,"and a little while later, the LORD told me"
Jeremiah,31,1,"The LORD said: Israel, I promise that some day all your tribes will again be my people, and I will be your God."
Jeremiah,31,2,"In the desert I was kind to those who escaped death. I gave them peace, and when the time is right, I'll do the same for you. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Jeremiah,31,3,"Some time ago, the LORD appeared to me and told me to say: Israel, I will always love you; that's why I've been so patient and kind."
Jeremiah,31,4,"You are precious to me, and so I will rebuild your nation. Once again you will dance for joy and play your tambourines."
Jeremiah,31,5,You will plant vineyards on the hills of Samaria and enjoy the grapes.
Jeremiah,31,6,"Some day those who guard the hill country of Ephraim will shout, “Let's go to Zion and worship the LORD our God.”"
Jeremiah,31,7,"The LORD says: Celebrate and sing for Israel, the greatest of nations. Offer praises and shout, “Come and rescue your people, LORD! Save what's left of Israel.”"
Jeremiah,31,8,"I, the LORD , will bring my people back from Babylonia and everywhere else on earth. The blind and the lame will be there. Expectant mothers and women about to give birth will come and be part of that great crowd."
Jeremiah,31,9,"They will weep and pray as I bring them home. I will lead them to streams of water. They will walk on a level road and not stumble. I am a father to Israel, my favourite children."
Jeremiah,31,10,"Listen to me, you nations nearby or across the sea. I scattered the people of Israel, but I will gather them again. I will protect them like a shepherd guarding a flock;"
Jeremiah,31,11,I will rescue them from enemies who could overpower them.
Jeremiah,31,12,"My people will come to Mount Zion and celebrate; their faces will glow because of my blessings. I'll give them grain, grapes, and olive oil, as well as sheep and cattle. Israel will be prosperous and grow like a garden with plenty of water."
Jeremiah,31,13,"Young women and young men, together with the elderly, will celebrate and dance, because I will comfort them and turn their sorrow into happiness."
Jeremiah,31,14,"I will bless my people with more food than they need, and the priests will enjoy the choice cuts of meat. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Jeremiah,31,15,"In Ramah a voice is heard, crying and weeping loudly. Rachel mourns for her children and refuses to be comforted, because they are dead."
Jeremiah,32,1,"The LORD spoke to me in the tenth year that Zedekiah was king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year that Nebuchadnezzar was king of Babylonia."
Jeremiah,32,2,"At that time, the Babylonian army had surrounded Jerusalem, and I was in the prison at the courtyard of the palace guards."
Jeremiah,32,3,"Zedekiah had ordered me to be held there because I told everyone that the LORD had said: I am the LORD , and I am about to let the king of Babylonia conquer Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,32,4,"King Zedekiah will be captured and taken to King Nebuchadnezzar, who will speak with him face to face."
Jeremiah,32,5,"Then Zedekiah will be led away to Babylonia, where he will stay until I have finished with him. So, if you people of Judah fight against the Babylonians, you will lose. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Jeremiah,32,6,"Later, when I was in prison, the LORD said:"
Jeremiah,32,7,"Jeremiah, your cousin Hanamel, the son of your uncle Shallum, will visit you. He must sell his field near the town of Anathoth, and because you are his nearest relative, you have the right and the responsibility to buy it and keep it in the family."
Jeremiah,32,8,"Hanamel came, just as the LORD had promised. And he said, “Please buy my field near Anathoth in the territory of the Benjamin tribe. You have the right to buy it, and if you do, it will stay in our family.” The LORD had told me to buy it"
Jeremiah,32,9,"from Hanamel, and so I did. The price was seventeen pieces of silver, and I weighed out the full amount on a scale."
Jeremiah,34,1,"King Nebuchadnezzar had a large army made up of people from every kingdom in his empire. He and his army were attacking Jerusalem and all the nearby towns, when the LORD told me"
Jeremiah,34,2,"to say to King Zedekiah: I am the LORD , and I am going to let Nebuchadnezzar capture this city and burn it down."
Jeremiah,34,3,"You will be taken prisoner and brought to Nebuchadnezzar, and he will speak with you face to face. Then you will be led away to Babylonia."
Jeremiah,34,4,"Zedekiah, I promise that you won't die in battle."
Jeremiah,34,5,"You will die a peaceful death. People will mourn when you die, and they will light bonfires in your honour, just as they did for your ancestors, the kings who ruled before you."
Jeremiah,34,6,I went to Zedekiah and told him what the LORD had said.
Jeremiah,34,7,"Meanwhile, the king of Babylonia was trying to break through the walls of Lachish, Azekah, and Jerusalem, the only three towns of Judah that had not been captured."
Jeremiah,35,1,"When Jehoiakim was king of Judah, the LORD told me,"
Jeremiah,35,2,"“Go to the Rechabite clan and invite them to meet you in one of the side rooms of the temple. When they arrive, offer them a drink of wine.”"
Jeremiah,35,3,"So I went to Jaazaniah, the leader of the clan, and I invited him and all the men of his clan."
Jeremiah,35,4,"I brought them into the temple courtyard and took them upstairs to a room belonging to the prophets who were followers of Hanan son of Igdaliah. It was next to a room belonging to some of the officials, and that room was over the one belonging to Maaseiah, a priest who was one of the high officials in the temple."
Jeremiah,35,5,"I set out some large bowls full of wine together with some cups, and then I said to the Rechabites, “Have some wine!”"
Jeremiah,35,6,"But they answered: No! The ancestor of our clan, Jonadab son of Rechab, made a rule that we must obey. He said, “Don't ever drink wine"
Jeremiah,35,7,"or build houses or plant crops and vineyards. Instead, you must always live in tents and move from place to place. If you obey this command, you will live a long time.”"
Jeremiah,36,1,"During the fourth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was king of Judah, the LORD said to me, “Jeremiah,"
Jeremiah,36,2,"since the time Josiah was king, I have been speaking to you about Israel, Judah, and the other nations. Now, get a scroll and write down everything I have told you,"
Jeremiah,36,3,"then read it to the people of Judah. Perhaps they will stop sinning when they hear what terrible things I plan for them. And if they turn to me, I will forgive them.”"
Jeremiah,36,4,"I sent for Baruch son of Neriah and asked him to help me. I repeated everything the LORD had told me, and Baruch wrote it all down on a scroll."
Jeremiah,36,5,"Then I said, Baruch, the officials refuse to let me go into the LORD 's temple,"
Jeremiah,36,6,so you must go instead. Wait for the next holy day when the people of Judah come to the temple to pray and to go without eating. Then take this scroll to the temple and read it aloud.
Jeremiah,36,7,"The LORD is furious, and if the people hear how he is going to punish them, perhaps they will ask to be forgiven."
Jeremiah,37,1,King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia had removed Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim from being the king of Judah and had made Josiah's son Zedekiah king instead.
Jeremiah,37,2,"But Zedekiah, his officials, and everyone else in Judah ignored everything the LORD had told me."
Jeremiah,38,1,"One day, Shephatiah, Gedaliah, Jehucal, and Pashhur heard me tell the people of Judah"
Jeremiah,40,1,"I was led away in chains along with the people of Judah and Jerusalem who were being taken to Babylonia. Nebuzaradan was the officer in charge of the guard, and when we stopped at Ramah, the LORD made him set me free."
Jeremiah,40,2,"Nebuzaradan said: Jeremiah, the LORD your God warned your people that he would bring disaster on this land."
Jeremiah,40,3,"But they continued to rebel against him, and now he has punished them just as he threatened."
Jeremiah,40,4,"Today I am taking the chains off your wrists and setting you free! If you want to, you can come with me to Babylonia, and I will see that you are taken care of. Or if you decide to stay here, you can go wherever you wish."
Jeremiah,40,5,"King Nebuchadnezzar has chosen Gedaliah to rule Judah. You can live near Gedaliah, and he will provide for you, or you can live anywhere else you want. Nebuzaradan gave me a supply of food, then let me leave."
Jeremiah,40,6,"I decided to stay with the people of Judah, and I went to live near Gedaliah in Mizpah."
Jeremiah,41,1,"But in the seventh month, Ishmael came to Mizpah with ten of his soldiers. He had been one of the king's officials and was a member of the royal family. Ishmael and his men were invited to eat with Gedaliah."
Jeremiah,41,2,"During the meal, Ishmael and his soldiers killed Gedaliah, the man chosen as ruler of Judah by the king of Babylonia."
Jeremiah,41,3,"Then they killed the Jews who were with Gedaliah, and they also killed the Babylonian soldiers who were there."
Jeremiah,41,4,"The next day, the murders had still not been discovered,"
Jeremiah,41,5,"when eighty men came down the road towards Mizpah from the towns of Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria. They were on their way to the temple to offer gifts of grain and incense to the LORD . They had shaved off their beards, torn their clothes, and cut themselves, because they were mourning."
Jeremiah,41,6,"Ishmael went out of the town gate to meet them. He pretended to be weeping, and he asked them to come into Mizpah to meet with Gedaliah, the ruler of Judah."
Jeremiah,41,7,"But after they were inside the town, Ishmael ordered his soldiers to kill them and throw their bodies into a well."
Jeremiah,41,8,"He let ten of the men live, because they offered to give him supplies of wheat, barley, olive oil, and honey they had hidden in a field."
Jeremiah,41,9,"The well that he filled with bodies had been dug by King Asa of Judah to store rainwater, because he was afraid that King Baasha of Israel might surround Mizpah and keep the people from getting to their water supply."
Jeremiah,41,10,"Nebuzaradan, King Nebuchadnezzar's officer in charge of the guard, had left King Zedekiah's daughters and many other people at Mizpah, and he had put Gedaliah in charge of them. But now Ishmael took them all prisoner and led them towards Ammon, on the other side of the River Jordan."
Jeremiah,41,11,Johanan and the other army officers heard what Ishmael had done.
Jeremiah,41,12,So they and their troops chased Ishmael and caught up with him at the large pit at Gibeon.
Jeremiah,41,13,"When Ishmael's prisoners saw Johanan and the officers, they were happy"
Jeremiah,41,14,and turned round and ran towards Johanan.
Jeremiah,41,15,But Ishmael and eight of his men escaped and went to Ammon.
Jeremiah,41,16,"Johanan and the officers had rescued the women, children, and royal officials whom Ishmael had taken prisoner after killing Gedaliah. Johanan led the people from Gibeon"
Jeremiah,42,1,"Johanan, Jezaniah, the other army officers, and everyone else in the group, came to me"
Jeremiah,42,2,"and said, “Please pray to the LORD your God for us. Judah used to have many people, but as you can see, only a few of us are left."
Jeremiah,42,3,Ask the LORD to tell us where he wants us to go and what he wants us to do.”
Jeremiah,42,4,"“All right,” I answered, “I will pray to the LORD your God, and I will tell you everything he says.”"
Jeremiah,42,5,"They answered, “The LORD himself will be our witness that we promise to do whatever he says,"
Jeremiah,42,6,even if it isn't what we want to do. We will obey the LORD so that all will go well for us.”
Jeremiah,42,7,"Ten days later, the LORD gave me an answer for"
Jeremiah,42,8,"Johanan, the officers, and the other people. So I called them together"
Jeremiah,42,9,and told them that the LORD God of Israel had said: You asked Jeremiah to pray and find out what you should do.
Jeremiah,42,10,"I am sorry that I had to punish you, and so I now tell you to stay here in Judah, where I will plant you and build you up, instead of tearing you down and uprooting you."
Jeremiah,42,11,"Don't be afraid of the King of Babylonia. I will protect you from him,"
Jeremiah,42,12,and I will even force him to have mercy on you and give back your farms.
Jeremiah,42,13,"But you might keep on saying, “We won't stay here in Judah, and we won't obey the LORD our God."
Jeremiah,42,14,"We are going to Egypt, where there is plenty of food and no danger of war.”"
Jeremiah,42,15,"People of Judah, you survived when the Babylonian army attacked. Now you are planning to move to Egypt, and if you do go, this is what will happen."
Jeremiah,43,1,I told the people everything the LORD had told me.
Jeremiah,43,2,"But Azariah, Johanan and some other arrogant men said to me, “You're lying! The LORD didn't tell you to say that we shouldn't go to Egypt."
Jeremiah,43,3,"Baruch son of Neriah must have told you to say that. He wants the Babylonians to capture us, so they can take us away to Babylonia or even kill us.”"
Jeremiah,43,4,"Johanan, the other army officers, and everyone else refused to stay in Judah in spite of the LORD 's command."
Jeremiah,43,5,So Johanan and the officers led us away towards Egypt. The group that left Judah included those who had been scattered in other countries and who had then come back to live in Judah.
Jeremiah,43,6,"Baruch and I and others in the group had been staying with Gedaliah, because Nebuzaradan, the Babylonian officer in charge of the guard, had ordered him to take care of the king's daughters and quite a few men, women, and children."
Jeremiah,43,7,"The people disobeyed the LORD and went to Egypt. The group had settled in Tahpanhes,"
Jeremiah,43,8,when the LORD told me:
Jeremiah,43,9,"Jeremiah, carry some large stones to the entrance of the government building in Tahpanhes. Bury the stones underneath the brick pavement and be sure the Jews are watching."
Jeremiah,43,10,"Then tell them that I, the LORD All-Powerful, the God of Israel, have sent for my servant, Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia. I will bring him here and make him set up his throne and his royal tent over these stones that I told you to bury."
Jeremiah,43,11,He will attack Egypt and kill many of its people; others will die of disease or be dragged away as prisoners.
Jeremiah,44,1,"The LORD told me to speak with the Jews who were living in the towns of Migdol, Tahpanhes, and Memphis in northern Egypt, and also to those living in southern Egypt. He told me to tell them:"
Jeremiah,44,2,"I am the LORD All-Powerful, the God of Israel. You saw how I destroyed Jerusalem and the towns of Judah. They lie empty and in ruins today,"
Jeremiah,44,3,because the people of Judah made me angry by worshipping gods that had never helped them or their ancestors.
Jeremiah,44,4,"Time after time I sent my servants the prophets to tell the people of Judah how much I hated their disgusting sins. The prophets warned them to stop sinning,"
Jeremiah,44,5,but they refused to listen and would not stop worshipping other gods.
Jeremiah,44,6,"Finally, my anger struck like a raging flood, and today Jerusalem and the towns of Judah are nothing but empty ruins."
Jeremiah,44,7,"Why do you now insist on heading for another disaster? A disaster that will destroy not only you, but also your children and babies."
Jeremiah,44,8,"You have made me angry by worshipping idols and burning incense to other gods after you came here to Egypt. You will die such a disgusting death, that other nations will use the name of Judah as a curse word."
Jeremiah,44,9,"When you were living in Jerusalem and Judah, you followed the example of your ancestors in doing evil things, just like your kings and queens."
Jeremiah,44,10,"Even now, your pride keeps you from respecting me and obeying the laws and teachings I gave you and your ancestors."
Jeremiah,44,11,"I, the LORD All-Powerful, have decided to wipe you out with disasters."
Jeremiah,44,12,"There were only a few of you left in Judah, and you decided to go to Egypt. But you will die such horrible deaths in war or from starvation, that people of other countries will use the name of Judah as a curse word."
Jeremiah,44,13,"I punished Jerusalem with war, hunger, and disease, and that's how I will punish you."
Jeremiah,44,14,"None of you will survive. You may hope to return to Judah some day, but only a very few of you will escape death and be able to go back."
Jeremiah,44,15,A large number of Jews from both northern and southern Egypt listened to me as I told them what the LORD had said. Most of the men in the crowd knew that their wives often burnt incense to other gods. So they and their wives shouted:
Jeremiah,44,16,"Jeremiah, what do we care if you speak in the LORD 's name? We refuse to listen!"
Jeremiah,44,17,"We have promised to worship the goddess Astarte, the Queen of Heaven, and that is exactly what we are going to do. We will burn incense and offer sacrifices of wine to her, just as we, our ancestors, our kings, and our leaders did when we lived in Jerusalem and the other towns of Judah. We had plenty of food back then. We were well off, and nothing bad ever happened to us."
Jeremiah,44,18,"But since the time we stopped burning incense and offering wine sacrifices to her, we have been dying from war and hunger."
Jeremiah,44,19,"Then the women said, “When we lived in Judah, we worshipped the Queen of Heaven and offered sacrifices of wine and special loaves of bread shaped like her. Our husbands knew what we were doing, and they approved of it.”"
Jeremiah,44,20,Then I told the crowd:
Jeremiah,44,21,"Don't you think the LORD knew that you and your ancestors, your leaders and kings, and the rest of the people were burning incense to other gods in Jerusalem and everywhere else in Judah?"
Jeremiah,44,22,"And when he could no longer put up with your disgusting sins, he placed a curse on your land and turned it into a desert, as it is today."
Jeremiah,44,23,This disaster happened because you worshipped other gods and rebelled against the LORD by refusing to obey him or follow his laws and teachings.
Jeremiah,45,1,"In the fourth year that Jehoiakim was king of Judah, Baruch wrote down everything I had told him."
Jeremiah,45,2,"Then later, the LORD God of Israel told me to say to Baruch:"
Jeremiah,45,3,"You are moaning and blaming me, the LORD , for your troubles and sorrow, and for being so tired that you can't even rest."
Jeremiah,45,4,But all over the earth I am tearing down what I built and pulling up what I planted.
Jeremiah,45,5,"I am bringing disaster everywhere, so don't even think about making any big plans for yourself. However, I promise that wherever you go, I will at least protect you from death. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Jeremiah,46,1,The LORD often told me what to say about the different nations of the world.
Jeremiah,46,2,"In the fourth year that Jehoiakim was king of Judah, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia defeated King Neco of Egypt in a battle at the city of Carchemish near the River Euphrates. And here is what the LORD told me to say about the Egyptian army:"
Jeremiah,46,3,"It's time to go into battle! So grab your shields,"
Jeremiah,46,4,"saddle your horses, and polish your spears. Put on your helmets and armour, then take your positions."
Jeremiah,46,5,"I can see the battle now— you are defeated and running away, never once looking back. Terror is all around."
Jeremiah,46,6,"You are strong and run fast, but you can't escape. You fall in battle near the River Euphrates."
Jeremiah,46,7,"What nation is this, that rises like the River Nile overflowing its banks?"
Jeremiah,46,8,"It is Egypt, rising with a roar like a raging river and saying, “I'll flood the earth, destroying cities, and killing everyone in them.”"
Jeremiah,46,9,"Go ahead, Egypt. Tell your chariots and cavalry to attack and fight hard. Order your troops to march out, with Ethiopians and Libyans carrying shields, and the Lydians armed with bows and arrows."
Jeremiah,46,10,"But the LORD All-Powerful will win this battle and take revenge on his enemies. His sword will eat them and drink their blood until it is full. They will be killed in the north near the River Euphrates, as a sacrifice to the LORD."
Jeremiah,46,11,"Egypt, no medicine can heal you, not even the soothing lotion from Gilead."
Jeremiah,46,12,"All nations have heard you weep; you are disgraced, and they know it. Your troops fall to the ground, stumbling over each other."
Jeremiah,47,1,"Before the king of Egypt attacked the town of Gaza, the LORD told me to say to the Philistines:"
Jeremiah,47,2,"I, the LORD , tell you that your land will be flooded with an army from the north. It will destroy your towns and sweep you away, moaning and screaming."
Jeremiah,47,3,"When you hear the thunder of horses and chariots, your courage will vanish, and parents will abandon their own children."
Jeremiah,47,4,"You refugees from Crete, your time has now come, and I will destroy you. None of you will be left to help the cities of Tyre and Sidon."
Jeremiah,48,1,"The LORD All-Powerful, the God of Israel, told me to say to the nation of Moab: The town of Nebo is doomed; Kiriathaim will be captured and disgraced, and even its fortress will be left in ruins."
Jeremiah,48,2,"No one honours you, Moab. In Heshbon, enemies make plans to end your life. My sword will leave only silence in your town named “Quiet”."
Jeremiah,48,3,"The people of Horonaim will cry for help, as their town is attacked and destroyed."
Jeremiah,48,4,Moab will be shattered! Your children will sob
Jeremiah,48,5,and cry on their way up to the town of Luhith; on the road to Horonaim they will tell of disasters.
Jeremiah,48,6,Run for your lives! Head into the desert like a wild donkey.
Jeremiah,48,7,"You thought you could be saved by your power and wealth, but you will be captured along with your god Chemosh, his priests, and officials."
Jeremiah,48,8,"Not one of your towns will escape destruction. I have told your enemies, “Wipe out the valley and the flat lands of Moab."
Jeremiah,48,9,"Spread salt on the ground to kill the crops. Leave its towns in ruins, with no one living there."
Jeremiah,48,10,"I want you to kill the Moabites, and if you let them escape, I will put a curse on you.”"
Jeremiah,48,11,"Moab, you are like wine left to settle undisturbed, never poured from jar to jar. And so, your nation continues to prosper and improve."
Jeremiah,48,12,"But now, I will send enemies to pour out the wine and smash the jars!"
Jeremiah,48,13,"Then you will be ashamed, because your god Chemosh cannot save you, just as Bethel could not help the Israelites."
Jeremiah,48,14,You claim that your soldiers are strong and brave.
Jeremiah,48,15,"But I am the LORD, the all-powerful King, and I promise that enemies will overpower your towns. Even your best warriors will die in the battle."
Jeremiah,48,16,It won't be long now— disaster will hit Moab!
Jeremiah,48,17,"I will order the nearby nations to mourn for you and say, “Isn't it sad? Moab ruled others, but now its glorious power has been shattered.”"
Jeremiah,48,18,"People in the town of Dibon, you will be honoured no more, so have a seat in the dust. Your walls will be torn down when the enemies attack."
Jeremiah,48,19,"You people of Aroer, wait beside the road, and when refugees run by, ask them, “What happened?”"
Jeremiah,48,20,"They will answer, “Moab has been defeated! Weep with us in shame. Tell everyone at the River Arnon that Moab is destroyed.”"
Jeremiah,49,1,The LORD has this to say about the nation of Ammon: The people of Israel have plenty of children to inherit their lands. So why have you worshippers of the god Milcom taken over towns and land belonging to the Gad tribe?
Jeremiah,49,2,"Some day I will send an army to attack you in Rabbah, your capital city. It will be left in ruins, and the surrounding villages will lie in ashes. You took some of Israel's land, but on that day Israel will take yours!"
Jeremiah,49,3,"Cry, people of Heshbon; your town will become a pile of rubble. You will turn here and there, but your path will be blocked. Put on sackcloth and mourn, you citizens of Rabbah, because the idol you worship will be taken to a foreign country, along with its priests and temple officials."
Jeremiah,49,4,"You rebellious Ammonites trust your wealth and ask, “Who could attack us?” But I warn you not to boast when your strength is fading."
Jeremiah,49,5,"I, the LORD All-Powerful, will send neighbouring nations to strike you with terror. You will be scattered, with no one to care for your refugees."
Jeremiah,49,6,"Yet some day, I will bring your people back home. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Jeremiah,51,1,"I, the LORD , am sending a wind to destroy the people of Babylonia and Babylon, its capital."
Jeremiah,51,2,"Foreign soldiers will come from every direction, and when the disaster is over, Babylonia will be empty and worthless."
Jeremiah,51,3,"I will tell these soldiers, “Attack quickly, before the Babylonians can string their bows or put on their armour. Kill their best soldiers and destroy their army!”"
Jeremiah,51,4,Their troops will fall wounded in the streets of Babylon.
Jeremiah,51,5,"Everyone in Israel and Judah is guilty. But I, the LORD All-Powerful, their holy God, have not abandoned them."
Jeremiah,51,6,"Get out of Babylon! Run for your lives! If you stay, you will be killed when I take revenge on the city and punish it for its sins."
Jeremiah,51,7,"Babylon was my golden cup, filled with the wine of my anger. The nations of the world got drunk on this wine and went insane."
Jeremiah,51,8,"But suddenly, Babylon will fall and be destroyed. I, the LORD , told the foreigners who lived there, “Weep for the city! Get medicine for its wounds; perhaps they will heal.”"
Jeremiah,51,9,"The foreigners answered, “We have already tried to treat Babylon's wounds, but they would not heal. Come on, let's all go home to our own countries. Nothing is left in Babylonia; everything is destroyed.”"
Jeremiah,51,10,"The people of Israel said, “Tell everyone in Zion! The LORD has taken revenge for what Babylon did to us.”"
Jeremiah,51,11,"I, the LORD, want Babylon destroyed, because its army destroyed my temple. So, you kings of Media, sharpen your arrows and pick up your shields."
Jeremiah,51,12,"Raise the signal flag and attack the city walls. Post more guards. Command soldiers to watch the city and set up ambushes. I have made plans to destroy Babylon, and nothing will stop me."
Jeremiah,51,13,"People of Babylon, you live along the River Euphrates and are surrounded by canals. You are rich, but now the time has come for you to die."
Jeremiah,51,14,"I, the LORD All-Powerful, swear by my own life that enemy soldiers will fill your streets like a swarm of locusts. They will shout and celebrate their victory."
Jeremiah,51,15,God used his wisdom and power to create the earth and spread out the heavens.
Jeremiah,51,16,The waters in the heavens roar at his command. He makes clouds appear; he sends the wind from his storehouse and makes lightning flash in the rain.
Jeremiah,51,17,"People who make idols are stupid! They will be disappointed, because their false gods cannot breathe."
Jeremiah,51,18,"Idols are merely a joke, and when the time is right, they will be destroyed."
Jeremiah,51,19,"But the LORD , Israel's God, is all-powerful. He created everything, and he chose Israel to be his very own."
Jeremiah,51,20,"Babylonia, you were my hammer; I used you to pound nations and break kingdoms,"
Jeremiah,51,21,"to shatter cavalry and chariots,"
Jeremiah,51,22,"as well as men and women, young and old,"
Jeremiah,51,23,"shepherds and their flocks, farmers and their oxen, and governors and leaders."
Jeremiah,51,24,"But now, my people will watch, while I repay you for what you did to Zion."
Jeremiah,51,25,"You destroyed the nations and seem strong as a mountain, but I am your enemy. I might even grab you and roll you off a cliff. When I have finished, you'll only be a pile of scorched bricks."
Jeremiah,51,26,"Your stone blocks won't be reused for cornerstones or foundations, and I promise that for ever you will be a desert. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Jeremiah,51,27,"Signal the nations to get ready to attack. Raise a flag and blow a trumpet. Send for the armies of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz. Choose a commander; let the cavalry attack like a swarm of locusts."
Jeremiah,51,28,"Tell the kings and governors, the leaders and the people of the kingdoms of the Medes to prepare for war!"
Jeremiah,51,29,"The earth twists and turns in torment, because I have decided to make Babylonia a desert where no one can live, and I won't change my mind."
Jeremiah,51,30,"The Babylonian soldiers have lost their strength and courage. They stay in their fortresses, unable to fight, while the enemy breaks through the city gates, then sets their homes on fire."
Jeremiah,51,31,"One messenger after another announces to the king, “Babylon has been captured!"
Jeremiah,51,32,The enemy now controls the river crossings! The marshes are on fire! Your army has panicked!”
Jeremiah,51,33,"I am the LORD All-Powerful, the God of Israel, and I make this promise— “Soon Babylon will be levelled and packed down like a threshing place at harvest time.”"
Jeremiah,51,34,"The people of Jerusalem say, “King Nebuchadnezzar made us panic. That monster stuffed himself with us and our treasures, leaving us empty— he gobbled up what he wanted and spat out the rest."
Jeremiah,51,35,"The people of Babylonia harmed some of us and killed others. Now, LORD , make them pay!”"
Jeremiah,51,36,"My people, I am on your side, and I will take revenge on Babylon. I will cut off its water supply, and its stream will dry up."
Jeremiah,51,37,"Babylon will be a pile of rubble where only jackals live. People will laugh, but they will be afraid to walk among the ruins."
Jeremiah,51,38,The Babylonians roar and growl like young lions.
Jeremiah,51,39,"And since they are hungry, I will give them a banquet. They will celebrate, get drunk, then fall asleep, never to wake up!"
Jeremiah,51,40,"I will lead them away to die, like sheep, lambs, and goats being led to the butcher."
Jeremiah,51,41,"All nations now praise Babylon, but when it is captured, those same nations will be horrified."
Jeremiah,51,42,Babylon's enemies will rise like ocean waves and flood the city.
Jeremiah,51,43,"Horrible destruction will strike the nearby towns. The land will become a barren desert, where no one can live or even travel."
Jeremiah,51,44,"I will punish Marduk, the god of Babylon, and make him vomit everything he gobbled up. Then nations will no longer bring him gifts, and Babylon's walls will crumble."
Jeremiah,51,45,"Get out of Babylon, my people, and run for your lives, before I strike the city in my anger!"
Jeremiah,51,46,"Don't be afraid or lose hope, though year after year there are rumours of leaders fighting for control in the city of Babylon."
Jeremiah,51,47,"The time will come when I will punish Babylon's false gods. Everyone there will die, and the whole nation will be disgraced,"
Jeremiah,51,48,when an army attacks from the north and brings destruction. Then the earth and the heavens and everything in them will celebrate.
Jeremiah,51,49,"Babylon must be overthrown, because it slaughtered the people of Israel and of many other nations."
Jeremiah,51,50,"My people, you escaped death when Jerusalem fell. Now you live far from home, but you should trust me and think about Jerusalem. Leave Babylon! Don't stay!"
Jeremiah,51,51,"You feel ashamed and disgraced, because foreigners have entered my sacred temple."
Jeremiah,51,52,Soon I will send a war to punish Babylon's idols and leave its wounded people moaning everywhere.
Jeremiah,51,53,"Although Babylon's walls reach to the sky, the army I send will destroy that city. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Jeremiah,51,54,Listen to the cries for help coming from Babylon. Everywhere in the country the sounds of destruction can be heard.
Jeremiah,51,55,"The shouts of the enemy, like crashing ocean waves, will drown out Babylon's cries as I level the city."
Jeremiah,51,56,"An enemy will attack and destroy Babylon. Its soldiers will be captured and their weapons broken, because I am a God who takes revenge against nations for what they do."
Jeremiah,51,57,"I, the LORD All-Powerful, the true King, promise that the officials and advisers, the governors and leaders and the soldiers of Babylon will get drunk, fall asleep, and never wake up."
Jeremiah,51,58,"The thick walls of that city will be torn down, and its huge gates burnt. Everything that nation worked so hard to gain will go up in smoke."
Jeremiah,51,59,"During Zedekiah's fourth year as king of Judah, he went to Babylon. And Baruch's brother Seraiah went along as the officer in charge of arranging for places to stay overnight."
Jeremiah,51,60,"Before they left, I wrote on a scroll all the terrible things that would happen to Babylon."
Jeremiah,51,61,"I gave the scroll to Seraiah and said: When you get to Babylon, read this scroll aloud,"
Jeremiah,51,62,"then pray, “Our LORD , you promised to destroy this place and make it into a desert where no people or animals will ever live.”"
Jeremiah,51,63,"When you finish praying, tie the scroll to a rock and throw it in the River Euphrates. Then say,"
Jeremiah,51,64,"“This is how Babylon will sink when the LORD destroys it. Everyone in the city will die, and it won't have the strength to rise again.” Jeremiah's writing ends here."
Jeremiah,52,1,"Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he was appointed king of Judah, and he ruled from Jerusalem for eleven years. His mother Hamutal was the daughter of Jeremiah from the town of Libnah."
Jeremiah,52,2,"Zedekiah disobeyed the LORD , just as Jehoiakim had done,"
Jeremiah,52,3,and it was Zedekiah who finally rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar. The people of Judah and Jerusalem had made the LORD so angry that he finally turned his back on them. That's why horrible things were happening.
Jeremiah,52,4,"In Zedekiah's ninth year as king, on the tenth day of the tenth month, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia led his entire army to attack Jerusalem. The troops set up camp outside the city and built ramps up to the city walls."
Lamentations,1,1,"Jerusalem, once so crowded, lies deserted and lonely. This city that was known all over the world is now like a widow. This queen of the nations has been made a slave."
Lamentations,1,2,"Each night, bitter tears flood her cheeks. None of her former lovers are there to offer comfort; her friends have betrayed her and are now her enemies."
Lamentations,1,3,"The people of Judah are slaves, suffering in a foreign land, with no rest from sorrow. Their enemies captured them and were terribly cruel."
Lamentations,1,4,The roads to Zion mourn because no one travels there to celebrate the festivals. The city gates are deserted; priests are weeping. Young women are raped; Zion is in sorrow!
Lamentations,1,5,Enemies now rule the city and live as they please. The LORD has punished Jerusalem because of her awful sins; he has let her people be dragged away.
Lamentations,1,6,Zion's glory has disappeared. Her leaders are like deer that cannot find pasture; they are hunted down till their strength is gone.
Lamentations,1,7,Her people recall the good life that once was theirs; now they suffer and are scattered. No one was there to protect them from their enemies who sneered when their city was taken.
Lamentations,1,8,Jerusalem's horrible sins have made the city a joke. Those who once admired her now hate her instead— she has been disgraced; she groans and turns away.
Lamentations,1,9,"Her sins had made her filthy, but she wasn't worried about what could happen. And when Jerusalem fell, it was so tragic. No one gave her comfort when she cried out, “Help! I'm in trouble, LORD! The enemy has won.”"
Lamentations,1,10,"Zion's treasures were stolen. Jerusalem saw foreigners enter her place of worship, though the LORD had forbidden them to belong to his people."
Lamentations,1,11,"Everyone in the city groans while searching for food; they trade their valuables for barely enough scraps to stay alive. Jerusalem shouts to the LORD, “Please look and see how miserable I am!”"
Lamentations,1,12,"No passer-by even cares. Why doesn't someone notice my terrible sufferings? You were fiercely angry, LORD, and you punished me worst of all."
Lamentations,1,13,From heaven you sent a fire that burnt in my bones; you set a trap for my feet and made me turn back. All day long you leave me in shock from constant pain.
Lamentations,1,14,"You have tied my sins around my neck, and they weigh so heavily that my strength is gone. You have put me in the power of enemies too strong for me."
Lamentations,1,15,"You, LORD , have turned back my warriors and crushed my young heroes. Judah was a woman untouched, but you let her be trampled like grapes in a wine-pit."
Lamentations,1,16,"Because of this, I mourn, and tears flood my eyes. No one is here to comfort or to encourage me; we have lost the war— my people are suffering."
Lamentations,1,17,"Zion reaches out her hands, but no one offers comfort. The LORD has turned the neighbouring nations against Jacob's descendants. Jerusalem is merely a filthy rag to her neighbours."
Lamentations,1,18,"The LORD was right, but I refused to obey him. Now I ask all of you to look at my sufferings— even my young people have been dragged away."
Lamentations,1,19,"I called out to my lovers, but they betrayed me. My priests and my leaders died while searching the city for scraps of food."
Lamentations,1,20,"Won't you look and see how upset I am, our LORD? My stomach is in knots, and my heart is broken because I betrayed you. In the streets and at home, my people are slaughtered."
Lamentations,1,21,"Everyone heard my groaning, but no one offered comfort. My enemies know of the trouble that you have brought on me, and it makes them glad. Hurry and punish them, as you have promised."
Lamentations,1,22,Don't let their evil deeds escape your sight. Punish them as much as you have punished me because of my sins. I never stop groaning— I've lost all hope!
Lamentations,2,1,The Lord was angry! So he disgraced Zion though it was Israel's pride and his own place of rest. In his anger he threw Zion down from heaven to earth.
Lamentations,2,2,"The LORD had no mercy! He destroyed the homes of Jacob's descendants. In his anger he tore down every walled city in Judah; he toppled the nation together with its leaders, leaving them in shame."
Lamentations,2,3,The Lord was so furiously angry that he wiped out the whole army of Israel by not supporting them when the enemy attacked. He was like a raging fire that swallowed up the descendants of Jacob.
Lamentations,2,4,"He attacked like an enemy with a bow and arrows, killing our loved ones. He has burnt to the ground the homes on Mount Zion."
Lamentations,2,5,"The Lord was like an enemy! He left Israel in ruins with its palaces and fortresses destroyed, and with everyone in Judah moaning and weeping."
Lamentations,2,6,"He shattered his temple like a hut in a garden; he completely wiped out his meeting place, and did away with festivals and Sabbaths in the city of Zion. In his fierce anger he rejected our king and priests."
Lamentations,2,7,"The Lord abandoned his altar and his temple; he let Zion's enemies capture her fortresses. Noisy shouts were heard from the temple, as if it were a time of celebration."
Lamentations,2,8,The LORD had decided to tear down the walls of Zion stone by stone. So he started destroying and did not stop until walls and fortresses mourned and trembled.
Lamentations,2,9,"Zion's gates have fallen face down on the ground; the bars that locked the gates are smashed to pieces. Her king and royal family are prisoners in foreign lands. Her priests don't teach, and her prophets don't have a message from the LORD."
Lamentations,2,10,"Zion's leaders are silent. They just sit on the ground, tossing dust on their heads and wearing sackcloth. Her young women can do nothing but stare at the ground."
Lamentations,2,11,"My eyes are red from crying, my stomach is in knots, and I feel sick all over. My people are being wiped out, and children lie helpless in the streets of the city."
Lamentations,2,12,"A child begs its mother for food and drink, then blacks out like a wounded soldier lying in the street. The child slowly dies in its mother's arms."
Lamentations,2,13,"Zion, how can I comfort you? How great is your pain? Lovely city of Jerusalem, how can I heal your wounds, gaping as wide as the sea?"
Lamentations,2,14,Your prophets deceived you with false visions and lying messages— they should have warned you to leave your sins and be saved from disaster.
Lamentations,2,15,"Those who pass by shake their heads and sneer as they make fun and shout, “What a lovely city you were, the happiest on earth, but look at you now!”"
Lamentations,2,16,"Zion, your enemies curse you and snarl like wild animals, while shouting, “This is the day we've waited for! At last, we've got you!”"
Lamentations,2,17,The LORD has done everything that he had planned and threatened long ago. He destroyed you without mercy and let your enemies boast about their powerful forces.
Lamentations,2,18,"Zion, deep in your heart you cried out to the Lord. Now let your tears overflow your walls day and night. Don't ever lose hope or let your tears stop."
Lamentations,2,19,"Get up and pray for help all through the night. Pour out your feelings to the Lord, as you would pour water out of a jug. Beg him to save your people, who are starving to death at every street crossing."
Lamentations,2,20,"Think about it, LORD! Have you ever been this cruel to anyone before? Is it right for mothers to eat their children, or for priests and prophets to be killed in your temple?"
Lamentations,2,21,"My people, both young and old, lie dead in the streets. Because you were angry, my young men and women were brutally slaughtered."
Lamentations,2,22,"When you were angry, LORD, you invited my enemies like guests for a party. No one survived that day; enemies killed my children, my own little ones."
Lamentations,3,1,I have suffered much because God was angry.
Lamentations,3,2,"He chased me into a dark place, where no light could enter."
Lamentations,3,3,"I am the only one he punishes over and over again, without ever stopping."
Lamentations,3,4,"God caused my skin and flesh to waste away, and he crushed my bones."
Lamentations,3,5,He attacked and surrounded me with hardships and trouble;
Lamentations,3,6,he forced me to sit in the dark like someone long dead.
Lamentations,3,7,"God built a fence around me that I cannot climb over, and he chained me down."
Lamentations,3,8,"Even when I shouted and prayed for help, he refused to listen."
Lamentations,3,9,God put big rocks in my way and made me follow a crooked path.
Lamentations,3,10,God was like a bear or a lion waiting in ambush for me;
Lamentations,3,11,"he dragged me from the road, then tore me to shreds."
Lamentations,3,12,God took careful aim and shot his arrows
Lamentations,3,13,straight through my heart.
Lamentations,3,14,I am a joke to everyone— no one ever stops making fun of me.
Lamentations,3,15,God has turned my life sour.
Lamentations,3,16,He made me eat gravel and rubbed me in the earth.
Lamentations,3,17,I cannot find peace or remember happiness.
Lamentations,3,18,"I tell myself, “I am finished! I can't count on the LORD to do anything for me.”"
Lamentations,3,19,Just thinking of my troubles and my lonely wandering makes me miserable.
Lamentations,3,20,"That's all I ever think about, and I am depressed."
Lamentations,3,21,Then I remember something that fills me with hope.
Lamentations,3,22,"The LORD 's kindness never fails! If he had not been merciful, we would have been destroyed."
Lamentations,3,23,The LORD can always be trusted to show mercy each morning.
Lamentations,3,24,"Deep in my heart I say, “The LORD is all I need; I can depend on him!”"
Lamentations,3,25,The LORD is kind to everyone who trusts and obeys him.
Lamentations,3,26,It is good to wait patiently for the LORD to save us.
Lamentations,3,27,"When we are young, it is good to struggle hard"
Lamentations,3,28,"and to sit silently alone, if this is what the LORD intends."
Lamentations,3,29,Being rubbed in the earth can teach us a lesson;
Lamentations,3,30,we can also learn from insults and hard knocks.
Lamentations,3,31,The Lord won't always reject us!
Lamentations,3,32,"He causes a lot of suffering, but he also has pity because of his great love."
Lamentations,3,33,The Lord doesn't enjoy sending grief or pain.
Lamentations,3,34,Don't trample prisoners under your feet
Lamentations,3,35,"or cheat anyone out of what is rightfully theirs. God Most High sees everything,"
Lamentations,3,36,and he knows when you refuse to give someone a fair trial.
Lamentations,3,37,No one can do anything without the Lord's approval.
Lamentations,3,38,Good and bad each happen at the command of God Most High.
Lamentations,3,39,We're still alive! We shouldn't complain when we are being punished for our sins.
Lamentations,3,40,"Instead, we should think about the way we are living, and turn back to the LORD."
Lamentations,3,41,"When we lift our hands in prayer to God in heaven, we should offer him our hearts and say,"
Lamentations,3,42,"“We've sinned! We've rebelled against you, and you haven't forgiven us!"
Lamentations,3,43,"Anger is written all over you, as you pursue and slaughter us without showing pity."
Lamentations,3,44,You are behind a wall of clouds that blocks out our prayers.
Lamentations,3,45,You allowed nations to treat us like rubbish;
Lamentations,3,46,our enemies curse us.
Lamentations,3,47,"We are terrified and trapped, caught and crushed.”"
Lamentations,3,48,"My people are destroyed! Tears flood my eyes,"
Lamentations,3,49,and they won't stop
Lamentations,3,50,until the LORD looks down from heaven and helps.
Lamentations,3,51,I am horrified when I see what enemies have done to the young women of our city.
Lamentations,3,52,"No one had reason to hate me, but I was hunted down like a bird."
Lamentations,3,53,Then they tried to kill me by tossing me into a pit and throwing stones at me.
Lamentations,3,54,Water covered my head— I thought I was gone.
Lamentations,3,55,"From the bottom of the pit, I prayed to you, LORD."
Lamentations,3,56,I begged you to listen. “Help!” I shouted. “Save me!” You answered my prayer
Lamentations,3,57,"and came when I was in need. You told me, “Don't worry!”"
Lamentations,3,58,You rescued me and saved my life.
Lamentations,3,59,"You saw them abuse me, LORD, so make things right."
Lamentations,3,60,You know every plot they have made against me.
Lamentations,3,61,"Yes, you know their insults and their evil plans."
Lamentations,3,62,All day long they attack with words and whispers.
Lamentations,3,63,"No matter what they are doing, they keep on mocking me."
Lamentations,3,64,"Pay them back for everything they have done, LORD!"
Lamentations,3,65,Put your curse on them and make them suffer.
Lamentations,3,66,Get angry and go after them until not a trace is left under the heavens.
Lamentations,4,1,The purest gold is ruined and has lost its shine; jewels from the temple lie scattered in the streets.
Lamentations,4,2,"These are Zion's people, worth more than purest gold; yet they are counted worthless like dishes of clay."
Lamentations,4,3,"Even jackals nurse their young, but my people are like ostriches that abandon their own."
Lamentations,4,4,"Babies are so thirsty that their tongues are stuck to the roof of the mouth. Children go begging for food, but no one gives them any."
Lamentations,4,5,All who ate expensive foods lie starving in the streets; those who grew up in luxury now sit on rubbish heaps.
Lamentations,4,6,"My nation was punished worse than the people of Sodom, whose city was destroyed in a flash without the help of human hands."
Lamentations,4,7,The leaders of Jerusalem were purer than snow and whiter than milk; their bodies were healthy and glowed like jewels.
Lamentations,4,8,"Now they are blacker than tar, and no one recognizes them; their skin clings to their bones and is drier than firewood."
Lamentations,4,9,Being killed with a sword is better than slowly starving to death.
Lamentations,4,10,Life in the city is so bad that loving mothers have boiled and eaten their own children.
Lamentations,4,11,The LORD was so fiercely angry that he burnt the city of Zion to the ground.
Lamentations,4,12,Not a king on this earth or the people of any nation believed enemies could break through her gates.
Lamentations,4,13,Jerusalem was punished because her prophets and her priests had sinned and caused the death of innocent victims.
Lamentations,4,14,"Yes, her prophets and priests were covered with blood; no one would come near them, as they wandered from street to street."
Lamentations,4,15,"Instead, everyone shouted, “Go away! Don't touch us! You're filthy and unfit to belong to God's people!” So they had to leave and become refugees. But foreign nations told them, “You can't stay here!”"
Lamentations,4,16,"The LORD is the one who sent them scattering, and he has forgotten them. No respect or kindness will be shown to the priests or leaders."
Lamentations,4,17,"Our eyes became weary, hopelessly looking for help from a nation that could not save us."
Lamentations,4,18,Enemies hunted us down on every public street. Our time was up; our doom was near.
Lamentations,4,19,They swooped down faster than eagles from the sky. They hunted for us in the hills and set traps to catch us out in the desert.
Lamentations,4,20,"The LORD 's chosen leader was our hope for survival! We thought he would keep us safe somewhere among the nations, but even he was caught in one of their traps."
Lamentations,4,21,You people of Edom can celebrate now! But your time will come to suffer and stagger around naked.
Lamentations,4,22,"The people of Zion have paid for their sins, and the Lord will soon let them return home. But, people of Edom, you will be punished, and your sins exposed."
Lamentations,5,1,"Our LORD , don't forget how we have suffered and been disgraced."
Lamentations,5,2,Foreigners and strangers have taken our land and our homes.
Lamentations,5,3,We are like children whose mothers are widows.
Lamentations,5,4,The water we drink and the wood we burn cost far too much.
Lamentations,5,5,We are terribly ill-treated; we are worn out and can find no rest.
Lamentations,5,6,We had to surrender to Egypt and Assyria because we were hungry.
Lamentations,5,7,"Our ancestors sinned, but they are dead, and we are left to pay for their sins."
Lamentations,5,8,"Slaves are now our rulers, and there is no one to set us free."
Lamentations,5,9,We are in danger from brutal desert tribes; we must risk our lives just to bring in our crops.
Lamentations,5,10,Our skin is scorched from fever and hunger.
Lamentations,5,11,On Zion and everywhere in Judah our wives and daughters are being raped.
Lamentations,5,12,"Our rulers are strung up by their arms, and our nation's advisers are treated shamefully."
Lamentations,5,13,Young men are forced to do the work of slaves; boys must carry heavy loads of wood.
Lamentations,5,14,"Our leaders are not allowed to decide cases in court, and young people no longer play music."
Lamentations,5,15,"Our hearts are sad; instead of dancing, we mourn."
Lamentations,5,16,Zion's glory has disappeared! And we are doomed because of our sins.
Lamentations,5,17,We feel sick all over and can't even see straight;
Lamentations,5,18,"our city is in ruins, overrun by wild dogs."
Lamentations,5,19,"You will rule for ever, LORD! You are King for all time."
Lamentations,5,20,Why have you forgotten us for so long?
Lamentations,5,21,Bring us back to you! Give us a fresh start.
Lamentations,5,22,Or do you despise us so much that you don't want us?
Ezekiel,2,1,"The LORD said, “Ezekiel, son of man, I want you to stand up and listen.”"
Ezekiel,2,2,"After he said this, his Spirit took control of me and lifted me to my feet. Then the LORD said:"
Ezekiel,2,3,"Ezekiel, I am sending you to the people of Israel. They are just like their ancestors who rebelled against me and refused to stop."
Ezekiel,2,4,"They are stubborn and hard-headed. But I, the LORD God, have chosen you to tell them what I say."
Ezekiel,2,5,"Those rebels may not even listen, but at least they will know that a prophet has come to them."
Ezekiel,2,6,Don't be afraid of them or of anything they say. You may think you're in the middle of thorn bushes or scorpions. But be brave
Ezekiel,2,7,"and preach my message to them, whether they choose to listen or not."
Ezekiel,2,8,"Ezekiel, don't rebel against me, as they have done. Instead, listen to everything I tell you. And now, Ezekiel, open your mouth and eat what I am going to give you."
Ezekiel,2,9,"Just then, I saw a hand stretched out towards me. And in it was a scroll."
Ezekiel,2,10,"The hand opened the scroll, and both sides of it were filled with words of sadness, mourning, and grief."
Ezekiel,3,1,"The LORD said, “Ezekiel, son of man, after you eat this scroll, go and speak to the people of Israel.”"
Ezekiel,4,1,"Ezekiel, son of man, find a brick and sketch a picture of Jerusalem on it."
Ezekiel,4,2,Then prepare to attack the brick as if it were a real city. Build an earth mound and a ramp up to the top and surround the brick with enemy camps. On every side put large wooden poles as though you were going to break down the gate to the city.
Ezekiel,4,3,Set up an iron pan like a wall between you and the brick. All this will be a warning for the people of Israel.
Ezekiel,5,1,"Ezekiel, son of man, get a sharp sword and use it to cut off your hair and beard. Weigh the hair and divide it into three equal piles."
Ezekiel,5,2,"After you attack the brick that stands for Jerusalem, burn one pile of your hair on the brick. Chop up the second pile and let the small pieces of hair fall around the brick. Throw the third pile into the wind, and I will strike it with my own sword."
Ezekiel,5,3,Keep a few of the hairs and wrap them in the hem of your clothes.
Ezekiel,5,4,"Then pull out a few of those hairs and throw them in the fire, so they will also burn. This fire will spread, destroying everyone in Israel."
Ezekiel,5,5,"I am the LORD God, and I have made Jerusalem the most important place in the world, and all other nations admire it."
Ezekiel,5,6,But the people of Jerusalem rebelled and refuse to obey me. They ignored my laws and have become even more sinful than the nations around them.
Ezekiel,5,7,"So tell the people of Jerusalem: I am the LORD God! You have refused to obey my laws and teachings, and instead you have obeyed the laws of the surrounding nations. You have become more rebellious than any of them!"
Ezekiel,5,8,Now all those nations will watch as I turn against you and punish you
Ezekiel,5,9,for your sins. Your punishment will be more horrible than anything I've ever done or will ever do again.
Ezekiel,5,10,"Parents will be so desperate for food that they will eat their own children, and children will eat their parents. Those who survive this horror will be scattered in every direction."
Ezekiel,5,11,Your disgusting sins have made my temple unfit as a place to worship me. So I swear by my own life that I will turn my back on you and show you no pity.
Ezekiel,5,12,"A third of you will die here in Jerusalem from disease or starvation. Another third will be killed in war. And I will scatter the last third of you in every direction, then track you down and kill you."
Ezekiel,5,13,"You will feel my fierce anger until I have finished taking revenge. Then you will know that I, the LORD , was furious because of your disobedience."
Ezekiel,5,14,Every passer-by will laugh at your destruction. Foreign nations
Ezekiel,5,15,"will insult you and make fun of you, but they will also be shocked and terrified at what I did in my anger."
Ezekiel,5,16,"I will destroy your crops until you starve to death, and disasters will strike you like arrows."
Ezekiel,5,17,"Starvation and wild animals will kill your children. I'll punish you with horrible diseases, and your enemies will strike you down with their swords. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Ezekiel,6,1,The LORD God said:
Ezekiel,6,2,"Ezekiel, son of man, face the hills of Israel and tell them:"
Ezekiel,6,3,"Listen, you mountains and hills, and every valley and gorge! I, the LORD , am about to turn against you and crush all the places where foreign gods are worshipped."
Ezekiel,6,4,"Every altar will be smashed, and in front of the idols I will put to death the people who worship them."
Ezekiel,6,5,Dead bodies and bones will be lying around the idols and the altars.
Ezekiel,6,6,"Every town in Israel will be destroyed to make sure that each shrine, idol, and altar is smashed—everything the Israelites made will be a pile of ruins."
Ezekiel,6,7,"All over the country, your people will die. And those who survive will know that I, the LORD , did these things."
Ezekiel,6,8,"I will let some of the people live through this punishment, but I will scatter them among the nations,"
Ezekiel,6,9,"where they will be prisoners. And when they think of me, they will realize that they disgraced me by rebelling and by worshipping idols. They will hate themselves for the evil things they did,"
Ezekiel,6,10,and they will know that I am the LORD and that my warnings must be taken seriously.
Ezekiel,6,11,"The LORD God then said: Ezekiel, beat your fists together and stamp your feet in despair! Moan in sorrow, because the people of Israel have done disgusting things and now will be killed by enemy troops, or they will die from starvation and disease."
Ezekiel,6,12,Those who live far away will be struck with deadly diseases. Those who live nearby will be killed in war. And the ones who are left will starve to death. I will let loose my anger on them!
Ezekiel,6,13,"These people used to offer incense to idols at altars built on hills and mountaintops and in the shade of large oak trees. But when they see dead bodies lying around those altars, they will know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,6,14,"I will make their country a barren wasteland, from the Southern Desert to the town of Diblah in the north. Then they will know that I, the LORD , have done these things."
Ezekiel,7,1,The LORD God said:
Ezekiel,7,2,"Ezekiel, son of man, tell the people of Israel that I am saying: Israel will soon come to an end! Your whole country is about to be destroyed"
Ezekiel,7,3,"as punishment for your disgusting sins. I, the LORD , am so angry"
Ezekiel,7,4,"that I will show no pity. I will punish you for the evil you've done, and you will know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,7,5,There's never been anything like the coming disaster.
Ezekiel,7,6,"And when it comes, your life will be over."
Ezekiel,7,7,You people of Israel are doomed! Soon there will be panic on the mountaintops instead of celebration.
Ezekiel,7,8,I will let loose my anger and punish you for the evil things you've done. You'll get what you deserve.
Ezekiel,7,9,"Your sins are so terrible, that you'll get no mercy from me. Then you will know that I, the LORD , have punished you."
Ezekiel,7,10,"Disaster is near! Injustice and arrogance are everywhere,"
Ezekiel,7,11,"and violent criminals run free. None of you will survive the disaster, and everything you own and value will be shattered."
Ezekiel,7,12,"The time is coming when everyone will be ruined. Buying and selling will stop,"
Ezekiel,7,13,"and people who sell property will never get it back, because all of you must be punished for your sins. And I won't change my mind!"
Ezekiel,7,14,"A signal has been blown on the trumpet, and weapons are prepared for battle. But no one goes to war, because in my anger I will strike down everyone in Israel."
Ezekiel,7,15,"War, disease, and starvation are everywhere! People who live in the countryside will be killed in battle, and those who live in towns will die from starvation or deadly diseases."
Ezekiel,7,16,"Anyone who survives will escape into the hills, like doves who leave the valleys to find safety. All of you will moan because of your sins."
Ezekiel,7,17,"Your hands will tremble, and your knees will go limp."
Ezekiel,7,18,"You will put on sackcloth to show your sorrow, but terror will overpower you. Shame will be written all over your faces, and you will shave your heads in despair."
Ezekiel,7,19,"Your silver and gold will be thrown into the streets like rubbish, because those are the two things that led you into sin, and now they cannot save you from my anger. They are not even worth enough to buy food."
Ezekiel,7,20,You took great pride in using your beautiful jewellery to make disgusting idols of foreign gods. So I will make your jewellery worthless.
Ezekiel,7,21,Wicked foreigners will rob and disgrace you.
Ezekiel,7,22,"They will break into my temple and leave it unfit as a place to worship me, but I will look away and let it happen."
Ezekiel,7,23,"Your whole country is in confusion! Murder and violence are everywhere in Israel,"
Ezekiel,7,24,"so I will tell the most wicked nations to come and take over your homes. They will put an end to the pride you have in your strong army, and they will make your places of worship unfit to use."
Ezekiel,7,25,You will be terrified and will desperately look for peace—but there will be no peace.
Ezekiel,7,26,"One tragedy will follow another, and you'll hear only bad news. People will beg prophets to give them a message from me. Priests will stop teaching my Law, and wise leaders won't be able to give advice."
Ezekiel,7,27,Even your king and his officials will lose hope and cry in despair. Your hands will tremble with fear. I will punish you for your sins and treat you the same way you have treated others. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel,8,1,"Six years after King Jehoiachin and the rest of us had been led away as prisoners to Babylonia, the leaders of Judah were meeting with me in my house. On the fifth day of the sixth month, the LORD God suddenly took control of me,"
Ezekiel,8,2,"and I saw something in the shape of a human. This figure was like fire from the waist down, and it was bright as polished metal from the waist up."
Ezekiel,8,3,"It reached out what seemed to be a hand and grabbed my hair. Then in my vision the LORD 's Spirit lifted me into the sky and carried me to Jerusalem. The Spirit took me to the north gate of the temple's inner courtyard, where there was an idol that disgusted the LORD and made him furious."
Ezekiel,8,4,"Then I saw the brightness of the glory of the God of Israel, just as I had seen it near the River Chebar."
Ezekiel,8,5,"God said to me, “Ezekiel, son of man, look north.” And when I did, I saw that disgusting idol by the altar near the gate."
Ezekiel,8,6,"God then said, “Do you see the terrible sins of the people of Israel? Their sins are making my holy temple unfit as a place to worship me. Yet you will see even worse things than this.”"
Ezekiel,8,7,"Next, I was taken to the entrance of the courtyard, where I saw a hole in the wall."
Ezekiel,8,8,"God said, “Make this hole bigger.” And when I did, I realized it was a doorway."
Ezekiel,8,9,"“Go in,” God said, “and see what horrible and evil things the people are doing.”"
Ezekiel,8,10,"Inside, I saw that the walls were covered with pictures of reptiles and disgusting, unclean animals, as well as with idols that the Israelites were worshipping."
Ezekiel,8,11,"Seventy Israelite leaders were standing there, including Jaazaniah son of Shaphan. Each of these leaders was holding an incense burner, and the smell of incense filled the room."
Ezekiel,8,12,"God said, “Ezekiel, do you see what horrible things Israel's leaders are doing in secret? They have filled their rooms with idols. And they say I can't see them, because they think I have already deserted Israel."
Ezekiel,8,13,But I will show you something even worse than this.”
Ezekiel,8,14,"He took me to the north gate of the temple, where I saw women mourning for the god Tammuz."
Ezekiel,8,15,"God asked me, “Can you believe what these women are doing? But now I want to show you something worse.”"
Ezekiel,8,16,"I was then led into the temple's inner courtyard, where I saw about twenty-five men standing near the entrance, between the porch and the altar. Their backs were to the LORD 's temple, and they were bowing down to the rising sun."
Ezekiel,8,17,"God said, “Ezekiel, it's bad enough that the people of Judah are doing these disgusting things. But they have also spread violence and injustice everywhere in Israel and have made me very angry. They have disgraced and insulted me in the worst possible way."
Ezekiel,8,18,"So in my fierce anger, I will punish them without mercy and refuse to help them when they cry out to me.”"
Ezekiel,9,1,"After that, I heard the LORD shout, “Come to Jerusalem, you men chosen to destroy the city. And bring your weapons!”"
Ezekiel,9,2,"I saw six men come through the north gate of the temple, each one holding a deadly weapon. A seventh man dressed in a linen robe was with them, and he was carrying things to write with. The men went into the temple and stood by the bronze altar."
Ezekiel,9,3,"The brightness of God's glory then left its place above the statues of the winged creatures inside the temple and moved to the entrance. The LORD said to the man in the linen robe,"
Ezekiel,9,4,“Walk through the city of Jerusalem and mark the forehead of anyone who is truly upset and sad about the disgusting things that are being done here.”
Ezekiel,10,1,"I saw the dome that was above the four winged creatures, and on it was the sapphire throne."
Ezekiel,10,2,"The LORD said to the man in the linen robe, “Walk among the four wheels beside the creatures and pick up as many hot coals as you can carry. Then scatter them over the city of Jerusalem.” I watched him as he followed the LORD 's instructions."
Ezekiel,10,3,"The winged creatures were standing south of the temple when the man walked among them. A cloud filled the inner courtyard,"
Ezekiel,10,4,"and the brightness of the LORD 's glory moved from above the creatures and stopped at the entrance of the temple. The entire temple was filled with his glory, and the courtyard was dazzling bright."
Ezekiel,10,5,The sound of the creatures' wings was as loud as the voice of God All-Powerful and could even be heard in the outer courtyard.
Ezekiel,10,6,The man in the robe was now standing beside a wheel.
Ezekiel,10,7,One of the four creatures reached its hand into the fire among them and gave him some of the hot coals. The man took the coals and left.
Ezekiel,10,8,"I noticed again that each of the four winged creatures had what looked like human hands under their wings,"
Ezekiel,10,9,and I saw the four wheels near the creatures. These wheels were shining like chrysolite.
Ezekiel,10,10,"Each wheel was exactly the same and had a second wheel that cut through the middle of it,"
Ezekiel,10,11,so that they could move in any direction without turning. The wheels moved together whenever the creatures moved.
Ezekiel,10,12,"I also noticed that the wheels and the creatures' bodies, including their backs, their hands, and their wings, were covered with eyes."
Ezekiel,10,13,And I heard a voice calling these “the wheels that spin”.
Ezekiel,10,14,"Each of the winged creatures had four faces: the face of a bull, the face of a human, the face of a lion, and the face of an eagle."
Ezekiel,11,1,"The LORD 's Spirit lifted me up and took me to the east gate of the temple, where I saw twenty-five men, including the two leaders, Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah."
Ezekiel,11,2,"The LORD said, “Ezekiel, son of man, these men are making evil plans and giving dangerous advice to the people of Jerusalem."
Ezekiel,11,3,"They say things like, ‘Let's build more houses. This city is like a cooking pot over a fire, and we are the meat, but at least the pot keeps us from being burnt in the fire.’"
Ezekiel,11,4,"So, Ezekiel, condemn them!”"
Ezekiel,11,5,"The LORD 's Spirit took control of me and told me to tell these leaders: I, the LORD God, know what you leaders are saying."
Ezekiel,11,6,You have murdered so many people that the city is filled with dead bodies!
Ezekiel,11,7,"This city is indeed a cooking pot, but the bodies of those you killed are the meat. And so I will force you to leave Jerusalem,"
Ezekiel,11,8,"and I'll send armies to attack you, just as you fear."
Ezekiel,11,9,Then you will be captured and punished by foreign enemies.
Ezekiel,11,10,"You will be killed in your own country, but not before you realize that I, the LORD , have done these things."
Ezekiel,11,11,"You leaders claim to be meat in a cooking pot, but you won't be protected by this city. No, you will die at the border of Israel."
Ezekiel,11,12,"You will realize that while you were following the laws of nearby nations, you were disobeying my laws and teachings. And I am the LORD!"
Ezekiel,11,13,"Before I finished speaking, Pelatiah dropped dead. I bowed down and cried out, “Please, LORD God, don't kill everyone left in Israel.”"
Ezekiel,11,14,The LORD replied:
Ezekiel,11,15,"Ezekiel, son of man, the people living in Jerusalem claim that you and the other Israelites who were taken to Babylonia are too far away to worship me. They also claim that the land of Israel now belongs only to them."
Ezekiel,11,16,"But here is what I want you to tell the Israelites in Babylonia: It's true that I, the LORD God, have forced you out of your own country and made you live among foreign nations. But for now, I will be with you wherever you are, so that you can worship me."
Ezekiel,11,17,"And some day, I will gather you from the nations where you are scattered and let you live in Israel again."
Ezekiel,11,18,"When that happens, I want you to clear the land of all disgusting idols."
Ezekiel,11,19,Then I will take away your stubbornness and make you eager to be completely faithful to me. You will want to obey me
Ezekiel,11,20,"and all my laws and teachings. You will be my people, and I will be your God."
Ezekiel,11,21,"But those who worship idols will be punished and get what they deserve. I, the LORD God, have spoken."
Ezekiel,11,22,"After the LORD had finished speaking, the winged creatures spread their wings and flew into the air, and the wheels were beside them. The brightness of the LORD 's glory above them"
Ezekiel,11,23,left Jerusalem and stopped at a hill east of the city.
Ezekiel,11,24,"Then in my vision, the LORD 's Spirit lifted me up and carried me back to the other exiles in Babylonia. The vision faded away,"
Ezekiel,11,25,and I told them everything the LORD had shown me.
Ezekiel,12,1,The LORD said:
Ezekiel,12,2,"Ezekiel, son of man, you are living among rebellious people. They have eyes, but refuse to see; they have ears, but refuse to listen."
Ezekiel,12,3,"So before it gets dark, here is what I want you to do. Pack a few things as though you were going to be taken away as a prisoner. Then go outside where everyone can see you and walk around from place to place. Perhaps as they watch, they will realize what rebels they are."
Ezekiel,12,4,"After you have done this, return to your house. Later that evening leave your house as if you were going into exile."
Ezekiel,12,5,"Dig through the wall of your house and crawl out, carrying the bag with you. Make sure everyone is watching."
Ezekiel,12,6,"Lift the bag to your shoulders, and with your face covered, take it into the darkness, so that you cannot see the land you are leaving. All this will be a warning for the people of Israel."
Ezekiel,12,7,"I did everything the LORD had said. I packed a few things. Then as the sun was going down, and while everyone was watching, I dug a hole through one of the walls of my house. I pulled out my bag, then lifted it to my shoulders and left in the darkness."
Ezekiel,12,8,"The next morning, the LORD"
Ezekiel,12,9,reminded me that those rebellious people didn't even ask what I was doing.
Ezekiel,12,10,So he sent me back to tell them: The LORD God has a message for the leader of Jerusalem and everyone living there!
Ezekiel,12,11,I have done these things to show them what will happen when they are taken away as prisoners.
Ezekiel,12,12,"The leader of Jerusalem will lift his own bag to his shoulders at sunset and leave through a hole that the others have dug in the wall of his house. He will cover his face, so he can't see the land he is leaving."
Ezekiel,12,13,"The LORD will spread out a net and trap him as he leaves Jerusalem. He will then be led away to the city of Babylon, but will never see that place, even though he will die there."
Ezekiel,12,14,"His own officials and troops will scatter in every direction, and the LORD will track them down and put them to death."
Ezekiel,12,15,"The LORD will force the rest of the people in Jerusalem to live in foreign nations, where they will realize that he has done all these things."
Ezekiel,12,16,"Some of them will survive the war, the starvation, and the deadly diseases. That way, they will be able to tell foreigners how disgusting their sins were, and that it was the LORD who punished them in this way."
Ezekiel,12,17,The LORD said:
Ezekiel,12,18,"Ezekiel, son of man, shake with fear when you eat, and tremble when you drink."
Ezekiel,12,19,"Tell the people of Israel that I, the LORD , say that some day everyone in Jerusalem will shake when they eat and tremble when they drink. Their country will be destroyed and left empty, because they have been cruel and violent."
Ezekiel,12,20,"Every town will lie in ruins, and the land will be a barren desert. Then they will know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,12,21,The LORD said:
Ezekiel,12,22,"Ezekiel, son of man, you've heard people in Israel use the saying, “Time passes, and prophets are proved wrong.”"
Ezekiel,12,23,"Now tell the people that I, the LORD , am going to prove that saying wrong. No one will ever be able to use it again in Israel, because very soon everything I have said will come true!"
Ezekiel,12,24,The people will hear no more useless warnings and false messages.
Ezekiel,12,25,"I will give them my message, and what I say will certainly happen. Warn those rebels that the time has come for them to be punished. I, the LORD , make this promise."
Ezekiel,13,1,The LORD said:
Ezekiel,13,2,"Ezekiel, son of man, condemn the prophets of Israel who say they speak in my name, but who preach messages that come from their own imagination. Tell them it's time to hear my message."
Ezekiel,13,3,"I, the LORD God, say those lying prophets are doomed! They don't see visions—they make up their own messages!"
Ezekiel,13,4,Israel's prophets are no better than jackals that hunt for food among the ruins of a city.
Ezekiel,13,5,They don't warn the people about coming trouble or tell them how dangerous it is to sin against me.
Ezekiel,13,6,"Those prophets lie by claiming they speak for me, but I have not even chosen them to be my prophets. And they still think their words will come true."
Ezekiel,13,7,"They say they're preaching my messages, but they are full of lies—I did not speak to them!"
Ezekiel,13,8,So I am going to punish those lying prophets for deceiving the people of Israel with false messages.
Ezekiel,13,9,I will turn against them and no longer let them belong to my people. They will not be allowed to call themselves Israelites or even to set foot in Israel. Then they will realize that I am the LORD God.
Ezekiel,13,10,"Those prophets refuse to be honest. They tell my people there will be peace, even though there's no peace to be found. They are like workers who think they can fix a shaky wall by covering it with paint."
Ezekiel,13,11,"But when I send rainstorms, hailstones, and strong winds, the wall will surely collapse."
Ezekiel,13,12,People will then ask the workers why the paint didn't hold it up.
Ezekiel,13,13,"That wall is the city of Jerusalem. And I, the LORD God, am so angry that I will send strong winds, rainstorms, and hailstones to destroy it."
Ezekiel,13,14,"The lying prophets have tried to cover-up the evil in Jerusalem, but I will tear down the city, all the way to its foundations. And when it collapses, those prophets will be killed, and everyone will know that I have done these things."
Ezekiel,13,15,"The city of Jerusalem and its lying prophets will feel my fierce anger. Then I will announce that the city has fallen and that the lying prophets are dead,"
Ezekiel,13,16,"because they promised my people peace, when there was no peace. I, the LORD God, have spoken."
Ezekiel,13,17,"Ezekiel, son of man, now condemn the women of Israel who preach messages that come from their own imagination."
Ezekiel,13,18,"Tell them they're doomed! They wear magic charms on their wrists and scarves on their heads, then trick others into believing they can predict the future. They won't get away with telling those lies."
Ezekiel,13,19,"They charge my people a few handfuls of barley and a couple of pieces of bread, and then give messages that are insulting to me. They use lies to sentence the innocent to death and to help the guilty go free. And my people believe them!"
Ezekiel,13,20,I hate the magic charms they use to trick people into believing their lies. I will rip those charms from their wrists and set free the people they have trapped like birds.
Ezekiel,13,21,I will tear the scarves from their heads and rescue my people from their power once and for all. Then they will know that I am the LORD God.
Ezekiel,13,22,"They do things I would never do. They lie to good people and encourage them to do wrong, and they convince the wicked to keep sinning and ruin their lives."
Ezekiel,13,23,"I will no longer let these women give false messages and use magic, and I will free my people from their control. Then they will know that I, the LORD , have done these things."
Ezekiel,14,1,"One day, some of Israel's leaders came to me and asked for a message from the LORD."
Ezekiel,14,2,"While they were there, the LORD said:"
Ezekiel,14,3,"Ezekiel, son of man, these men have started worshipping idols, though they know it will cause them to sin even more. So I refuse to give them a message!"
Ezekiel,14,4,"Tell the people of Israel that if they sin by worshipping idols and then go to a prophet to find out what I say, I will give them the answer their sins deserve."
Ezekiel,14,5,"When they hear my message, perhaps they will see that they need to turn back to me and stop worshipping those idols."
Ezekiel,14,6,"Now, Ezekiel, tell everyone in Israel: I am the LORD God. Stop worshipping your disgusting idols and come back to me."
Ezekiel,14,7,"Suppose one of you Israelites or a foreigner living in Israel rejects me and starts worshipping idols. If you then go to a prophet to find out what I say, I will answer"
Ezekiel,14,8,"by turning against you. I will make you a warning to anyone who might think of doing the same thing, and you will no longer belong to my people. Then you will know that I am the LORD and that you have sinned against me."
Ezekiel,14,9,"If a prophet gives a false message, I am the one who caused that prophet to lie. But I will still reject him and cut him off from my people,"
Ezekiel,14,10,and anyone who goes to that prophet for a message will be punished in the same way.
Ezekiel,14,11,"I will do this, so that you will come back to me and stop destroying yourselves with these disgusting sins. So turn back to me! Then I will be your God, and you will be my people. I, the LORD God, make this promise."
Ezekiel,14,12,The LORD God said:
Ezekiel,14,13,"Ezekiel, son of man, suppose an entire nation sins against me, and I punish it by destroying the crops and letting its people and livestock starve to death."
Ezekiel,14,14,"Even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were living in that nation, their faithfulness would not save anyone but themselves."
Ezekiel,14,15,"Or suppose I punish a nation by sending wild animals to eat people and scare away every passer-by, so that the land becomes a barren desert."
Ezekiel,14,16,"As surely as I live, I promise that even if these three men lived in that nation, their own children would not be spared. The three men would live, but the land would be an empty desert."
Ezekiel,14,17,Or suppose I send an enemy to attack a sinful nation and kill its people and livestock.
Ezekiel,14,18,"If these three men were in that nation when I punished it, not even their children would be spared. Only the three men would live."
Ezekiel,14,19,And suppose I am so angry that I send a deadly disease to wipe out the people and livestock of a sinful nation.
Ezekiel,14,20,"Again, even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were living there, I, the LORD , promise that the children of these faithful men would also die. Only the three of them would be spared."
Ezekiel,14,21,"I am the LORD God, and I promise to punish Jerusalem severely. I will send war, starvation, wild animals, and deadly disease to slaughter its people and livestock."
Ezekiel,14,22,"And those who survive will be taken from their country and led here to Babylonia. Ezekiel, when you see how sinful they are, you will know why I did all these things to Jerusalem."
Ezekiel,14,23,"You will be convinced that I, the LORD God, was right in doing what I did."
Ezekiel,15,1,"Some time later, the LORD said:"
Ezekiel,15,2,"Ezekiel, son of man, what happens to the wood of a grapevine after the grapes have been picked? It isn't like other trees in the forest,"
Ezekiel,15,3,"because the wood of a grapevine can't be used to make anything, not even a small peg to hang things on."
Ezekiel,15,4,"It can only be used as firewood. But after its ends are burnt and its middle is charred, it can't be used for anything."
Ezekiel,15,5,"The wood is useless before it is burnt, and afterwards, it is completely worthless."
Ezekiel,15,6,"I, the LORD God, promise that just as the wood of a grapevine is burnt as firewood,"
Ezekiel,15,7,"I will punish the people of Jerusalem with fire. Some of them have escaped one destruction, but soon they will be completely burnt. And when that happens, you, Ezekiel, will know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,15,8,"I will make their country an empty wasteland, because they have not been loyal to me. I, the LORD God, have spoken."
Ezekiel,16,1,The LORD said:
Ezekiel,16,2,"Ezekiel, son of man, remind the people of Jerusalem of their disgusting sins"
Ezekiel,16,3,"and tell them that I, the LORD God, am saying: Jerusalem, you were born in the country where Canaanites lived. Your father was an Amorite, and your mother was a Hittite."
Ezekiel,16,4,"When you were born, no one cut you loose from your mother or washed your body. No one rubbed your skin with salt and olive oil, and wrapped you in warm blankets."
Ezekiel,16,5,"Not one person loved you enough to do any of these things, and no one even felt sorry for you. You were despised, thrown into a field, and forgotten."
Ezekiel,16,6,"I saw you lying there, rolling around in your own blood, and I couldn't let you die."
Ezekiel,16,7,"I took care of you, like someone caring for a tender, young plant. You grew up to be a beautiful young woman with perfect breasts and long hair, but you were still naked."
Ezekiel,16,8,"When I saw you again, you were old enough to have sex. So I covered your naked body with my own robe. Then I solemnly promised that you would belong to me and that I, the LORD God, would take care of you."
Ezekiel,16,9,I washed the blood off you and rubbed your skin with olive oil.
Ezekiel,16,10,"I gave you the finest clothes and the most expensive robes, as well as sandals made from the best leather."
Ezekiel,16,11,"I gave you bracelets, a necklace,"
Ezekiel,16,12,"a ring for your nose, some earrings, and a beautiful crown."
Ezekiel,16,13,"Your jewellery was gold and silver, and your clothes were made of only the finest material and embroidered linen. Your bread was baked from fine flour, and you ate honey and olive oil. You were as beautiful as a queen,"
Ezekiel,16,14,"and everyone on earth knew it. I, the LORD God, had helped you become a lovely young woman."
Ezekiel,16,15,"You learnt that you were attractive enough to have any man you wanted, so you offered yourself to every passer-by."
Ezekiel,16,16,You made shrines for yourself and decorated them with some of your clothes. That's where you took your visitors to have sex with them. These things should never have happened!
Ezekiel,16,17,"You made idols out of the gold and silver jewellery I gave you, then you sinned by worshipping those idols."
Ezekiel,16,18,"You dressed them in the clothes you got from me, and you offered them the olive oil and incense I gave you."
Ezekiel,16,19,"I supplied you with fine flour, olive oil, and honey, but you sacrificed it all as offerings to please those idols. I, the LORD God, watched this happen."
Ezekiel,16,20,But you did something even worse than that—you sacrificed your own children to those idols!
Ezekiel,16,21,"You slaughtered my children, so you could offer them as sacrifices."
Ezekiel,16,22,You were so busy sinning and being a prostitute that you refused to think about the days when you were young and were rolling around naked in your own blood.
Ezekiel,16,23,"Now I, the LORD God, say you are doomed! Not only did you do these evil things,"
Ezekiel,16,24,but you also built places on every street corner
Ezekiel,16,25,where you disgraced yourself by having sex with anyone who walked by. And you did that more and more every day!
Ezekiel,16,26,"To make me angry, you even offered yourself to Egyptians, who were always ready to sleep with you."
Ezekiel,16,27,So I punished you by letting those greedy Philistine enemies take over some of your territory. But even they were offended by your disgusting behaviour.
Ezekiel,16,28,"You couldn't get enough sex, so you chased after Assyrians and slept with them. You still weren't satisfied,"
Ezekiel,16,29,so you went after Babylonians. But those merchants could not satisfy you either.
Ezekiel,16,30,"I, the LORD God, say that you were so disgusting that you would have done anything to get what you wanted."
Ezekiel,16,31,"You had sex on every street corner, and when you finished, you refused to accept money. That's worse than being a prostitute!"
Ezekiel,16,32,You are nothing but an unfaithful wife who would rather have sex with strangers than with your own husband.
Ezekiel,16,33,"Prostitutes accept money for having sex, but you bribe men from everywhere to have sex with you."
Ezekiel,16,34,You're not like other prostitutes. Men don't ask you for sex—you offer to pay them!
Ezekiel,16,35,"Jerusalem, you prostitute, listen to me."
Ezekiel,16,36,"You chased after lovers, then took off your clothes and had sex. You even worshipped disgusting idols and sacrificed your own children as offerings to them."
Ezekiel,16,37,"So I, the LORD God, will gather every one of your lovers, those you liked and those you hated. They will stand around you, and I will rip off your clothes and let all those lovers stare at your nakedness."
Ezekiel,16,38,"I will find you guilty of being an unfaithful wife and a murderer, and in my fierce anger I will sentence you to death!"
Ezekiel,16,39,"Then I will hand you over to your lovers, who will tear down the places where you had sex. They will take your clothes and jewellery, leaving you naked and empty-handed."
Ezekiel,16,40,Your lovers and an angry mob will stone you to death; they will cut your dead body into pieces
Ezekiel,16,41,and burn down your houses. Other women will watch these terrible things happen to you. I promise to stop you from being a prostitute and paying your lovers for sex.
Ezekiel,16,42,Only then will I calm down and stop being angry and jealous.
Ezekiel,16,43,"You made me furious by doing all these disgusting things and by forgetting how I took care of you when you were young. Then you made things worse by acting like a prostitute. You must be punished! I, the LORD God, have spoken."
Ezekiel,16,44,"People will use this saying about you, Jerusalem: “If the mother is bad, so is her daughter.”"
Ezekiel,16,45,"You are just like your mother, who hated her husband and her own children. You are also like your sisters, who hated their husbands and children. Your father was an Amorite, and your mother was a Hittite."
Ezekiel,16,46,"Your elder sister was Samaria, that city to your north with her nearby villages. Your younger sister was Sodom, that city to your south with her nearby villages."
Ezekiel,16,47,"You followed their way of life and their wicked customs, and soon you were more disgusting than they were."
Ezekiel,16,48,"As surely as I am the living LORD God, the people of Sodom and its nearby villages were never as sinful as you."
Ezekiel,16,49,They were arrogant and spoilt; they had everything they needed and still refused to help the poor and needy.
Ezekiel,16,50,"They thought they were better than everyone else, and they did things I hate. And so I destroyed them."
Ezekiel,16,51,"You people of Jerusalem have sinned twice as much as the people of Samaria. In fact, your evil ways have made both Sodom and Samaria look innocent."
Ezekiel,16,52,So their punishment will seem light compared to yours. You will be disgraced and put to shame because of your disgusting sins.
Ezekiel,16,53,"Some day I will bless Sodom and Samaria and their nearby villages. I will also bless you, Jerusalem."
Ezekiel,16,54,"Then you will be ashamed of how you've acted, and Sodom and Samaria will be relieved that they weren't as sinful as you."
Ezekiel,16,55,"When that day comes, you and Sodom and Samaria will once again be well off, and all nearby villages will be restored."
Ezekiel,16,56,"Jerusalem, you were so arrogant that you sneered at Sodom."
Ezekiel,16,57,"But now everyone has learnt how wicked you really are. The countries of Syria and Philistia, as well as your other neighbours, hate you and make insulting remarks."
Ezekiel,16,58,"You must pay for all the vulgar and disgusting things you have done. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Ezekiel,16,59,"Jerusalem, you deserve to be punished, because you broke your promises and ignored our agreement."
Ezekiel,16,60,"But I remember the agreement I made with you when you were young, and so I will make you a promise that will last for ever."
Ezekiel,16,61,"When you think about how you acted, you will be ashamed, especially when I return your sisters to you as daughters, even though this was not part of our agreement."
Ezekiel,16,62,"I will keep this solemn promise, and you will know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,16,63,"I will forgive you, but you will think about your sins and be too ashamed to say a word. I, the LORD God, have spoken."
Ezekiel,17,1,The LORD said:
Ezekiel,17,2,"Ezekiel, son of man, tell the people of Israel the following story,"
Ezekiel,17,3,"so they will understand what I am saying to them: A large eagle with strong wings and beautiful feathers once flew to Lebanon. It broke the top branch off a cedar tree,"
Ezekiel,17,4,then carried it to a nation of merchants and left it in one of their cities.
Ezekiel,17,5,"The eagle also took seed from Israel and planted it in a fertile field with plenty of water, like a willow tree beside a stream."
Ezekiel,17,6,"The seed sprouted and grew into a grapevine that spread over the ground. It had lots of leaves and strong, deep roots, and its branches grew upward towards the eagle."
Ezekiel,17,7,"There was another eagle with strong wings and thick feathers. The roots and branches of the grapevine soon turned towards this eagle, hoping it would bring water for the soil."
Ezekiel,17,8,"But the vine was already growing in fertile soil, where there was plenty of water to produce healthy leaves and large grapes."
Ezekiel,17,9,"Now tell me, Ezekiel, do you think this grapevine will live? Or will the first eagle pull it up by its roots and pluck off the grapes and let its new leaves die? The eagle could easily kill it without the help of a large and powerful army."
Ezekiel,17,10,"The grapevine is strong and healthy, but as soon as the scorching desert wind blows, it will quickly wither."
Ezekiel,17,11,The LORD said:
Ezekiel,17,12,"Ezekiel, ask the rebellious people of Israel if they know what this story means. Tell them that the king of Babylonia came to Jerusalem, then he captured the king of Judah and his officials, and took them back to Babylon as prisoners."
Ezekiel,17,13,"He chose someone from the family of Judah's king and signed a treaty with him, then made him swear to be loyal. He also led away other important citizens,"
Ezekiel,17,14,so that the rest of the people of Judah would obey only him and never gain control of their own country again.
Ezekiel,17,15,But this new king of Judah later rebelled against Babylonia and sent officials to Egypt to get horses and troops. Will this king be successful in breaking the treaty with Babylonia? Or will he be punished for what he's done?
Ezekiel,17,16,"As surely as I am the living LORD God, I swear that the king of Judah will die in Babylon, because he broke the treaty with the king of Babylonia, who appointed him king."
Ezekiel,17,17,Even the king of Egypt and his powerful army will be useless to Judah when the Babylonians attack and build earth ramps to invade the cities of Judah and kill its people.
Ezekiel,17,18,The king of Judah broke his own promises and ignored the treaty with Babylonia. And so he will be punished!
Ezekiel,17,19,"He made a promise in my name and swore to honour the treaty. And now that he has broken that promise, my name is disgraced. He must pay for what he's done."
Ezekiel,17,20,I will spread out a net to trap him. Then I will drag him to Babylon and see that he is punished for his unfaithfulness to me.
Ezekiel,17,21,"His best troops will be killed in battle, and the survivors will be scattered in every direction. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Ezekiel,18,1,The LORD said:
Ezekiel,18,2,"Ezekiel, I hear the people of Israel using the old saying, “Sour grapes eaten by parents leave a sour taste in the mouths of their children.”"
Ezekiel,18,3,"Now tell them that I am the LORD God, and as surely as I live, that saying will no longer be used in Israel."
Ezekiel,18,4,The lives of all people belong to me—parents as well as children. Only those who sin will be put to death.
Ezekiel,18,5,Suppose there is a truly good man who always does what is fair and right.
Ezekiel,18,6,He refuses to eat meat sacrificed to foreign gods at local shrines or to worship Israel's idols. He doesn't have sex with someone else's wife or with a woman having her monthly period.
Ezekiel,18,7,He never cheats or robs anyone and always returns anything taken as security for a loan; he gives food and clothes to the poor
Ezekiel,18,8,and doesn't charge interest when lending money. He refuses to do anything evil; he is fair to everyone
Ezekiel,18,9,"and faithfully obeys my laws and teachings. This man is good, and I promise he will live."
Ezekiel,18,10,But suppose this good man has an evil son who is violent and commits sins
Ezekiel,18,11,"his father never did. He eats meat at local shrines, has sex with someone else's wife,"
Ezekiel,18,12,"cheats the poor, and robs people. He keeps what is given to him as security for a loan. He worships idols, does disgusting things,"
Ezekiel,18,13,"and charges high interest when lending money. An evil man like that will certainly not live. He is the one who has done these horrible sins, so it's his own fault that he will be put to death."
Ezekiel,18,14,But suppose this evil man has a son who sees his father do these things and refuses to act like him.
Ezekiel,18,15,"He doesn't eat meat at local shrines or worship Israel's idols, and he doesn't have sex with someone else's wife."
Ezekiel,18,16,He never cheats or robs anyone and doesn't even demand security for a loan. He gives food and clothes to the poor
Ezekiel,18,17,"and refuses to do anything evil or to charge interest. And he obeys all my laws and teachings. Such a man will live. His own father sinned, but this good man will not be put to death for the sins of his father."
Ezekiel,18,18,It is his father who will die for cheating and robbing and doing evil.
Ezekiel,18,19,You may wonder why a son isn't punished for the sins of his father. It is because the son does what is right and obeys my laws.
Ezekiel,18,20,"Only those who sin will be put to death. Children won't suffer for the sins of their parents, and parents won't suffer for the sins of their children. Good people will be rewarded for what they do, and evil people will be punished for what they do."
Ezekiel,18,21,Suppose wicked people stop sinning and start obeying my laws and doing right. They won't be put to death.
Ezekiel,18,22,"All their sins will be forgiven, and they will live because they did right."
Ezekiel,18,23,"I, the LORD God, don't like to see wicked people die. I enjoy seeing them turn from their sins and live."
Ezekiel,18,24,"But when good people start sinning and doing disgusting things, will they live? No! All their good deeds will be forgotten, and they will be put to death because of their sins."
Ezekiel,18,25,You people of Israel accuse me of being unfair! But listen—I'm not unfair; you are!
Ezekiel,18,26,"If good people start doing evil, they must be put to death, because they have sinned."
Ezekiel,18,27,"And if wicked people start doing right, they will save themselves from punishment."
Ezekiel,18,28,"They will think about what they've done and stop sinning, and so they won't be put to death."
Ezekiel,18,29,But you still say that I am unfair. You are the ones who have done wrong and are unfair!
Ezekiel,18,30,"I will judge each of you for what you've done. So stop sinning, or else you will certainly be punished."
Ezekiel,18,31,Give up your evil ways and start thinking pure thoughts. And be faithful to me! Do you really want to be put to death for your sins?
Ezekiel,18,32,"I, the LORD God, don't want to see that happen to anyone. So stop sinning and live!"
Ezekiel,19,1,"Ezekiel, sing a funeral song for two of Israel's leaders:"
Ezekiel,19,2,Your mother was a brave lioness who raised her cubs among lions.
Ezekiel,19,3,"She taught one of them to hunt, and he learnt to eat people."
Ezekiel,19,4,"When the nations heard of him, they trapped him in a pit, then they used hooks to drag him to Egypt."
Ezekiel,19,5,"His mother waited for him to return. But soon she lost all hope and raised another cub, who also became fierce."
Ezekiel,19,6,He hunted with other lions and learnt to eat people.
Ezekiel,19,7,He destroyed fortresses and ruined towns; his mighty roar terrified everyone.
Ezekiel,19,8,"Nations plotted to kill him, and people came from everywhere to spread out a net and catch him in a trap."
Ezekiel,19,9,"They put him in a cage and took him to Babylonia. The lion was locked away, so that his mighty roar would never again be heard on Israel's hills."
Ezekiel,19,10,"Your mother was a vine growing near a stream. There was plenty of water, so she was filled with branches and with lots of fruit."
Ezekiel,19,11,"Her strong branches became symbols of authority, and she was taller than all other trees— everyone could see how strong and healthy she was."
Ezekiel,19,12,"But in anger, I pulled her up by the roots and threw her to the ground, where the scorching desert wind dried out her fruit. Her strong branches wilted and burnt up."
Ezekiel,19,13,"Then she was planted in a hot, dry desert,"
Ezekiel,19,14,"where her stem caught fire, and flames burnt her branches and fruit. Not one strong branch is left; she is stripped bare. This funeral song must be sung with sorrow."
Ezekiel,20,1,"Seven years after King Jehoiachin and the rest of us had been led away as prisoners to Babylonia, some of Israel's leaders came to me on the tenth day of the fifth month. They sat down and asked for a message from the LORD."
Ezekiel,20,2,"Just then, the LORD God said:"
Ezekiel,20,3,"Ezekiel, son of man, these leaders have come to find out what I want them to do. As surely as I live, I will not give them an answer of any kind."
Ezekiel,20,4,"Are you willing to warn them, Ezekiel? Then remind them of the disgusting sins of their ancestors."
Ezekiel,20,5,"Tell them that long ago I, the LORD God, chose Israel to be my own. I appeared to their ancestors in Egypt and made a solemn promise that I would be their God and the God of their descendants."
Ezekiel,20,6,I swore that I would rescue them from Egypt and lead them to a land I had already chosen. This land was rich with milk and honey and was the most splendid land of all.
Ezekiel,20,7,"I told them to get rid of their disgusting idols and not to sin by worshipping the gods of Egypt. I reminded them that I was the LORD their God,"
Ezekiel,20,8,"but they still rebelled against me. They refused to listen and kept on worshipping their idols and foreign gods. In my anger, I decided to punish the Israelites in Egypt."
Ezekiel,20,9,"But that would have made me look like a liar, because I had already promised in front of everyone that I would lead them out of Egypt."
Ezekiel,20,10,So I brought them out and led them into the desert.
Ezekiel,20,11,"I gave them my laws and teachings, so they would know how to live right."
Ezekiel,20,12,And I commanded them to respect the Sabbath as a way of showing that they were holy and belonged to me.
Ezekiel,20,13,"But the Israelites rebelled against me in the desert. They refused to obey my laws and teachings, and they treated the Sabbath like any other day. Then in my anger, I decided to destroy the Israelites in the desert once and for all."
Ezekiel,20,14,"But that would have disgraced me, because many other nations had seen me bring the Israelites out of Egypt."
Ezekiel,20,15,"Instead, I told them in the desert that I would not lead them into the beautiful, fertile land I had promised."
Ezekiel,20,16,"I said this because they had not only ignored my laws and teachings, but had disgraced my Sabbath and worshipped idols."
Ezekiel,20,17,"Yet, I felt sorry for them and could not let them die in the desert."
Ezekiel,20,18,So I warned the children not to act like their parents or follow their evil ways or worship their idols.
Ezekiel,20,19,I reminded them that I was the LORD their God and that they should obey my laws and teachings.
Ezekiel,20,20,I told them to respect my Sabbath to show that they were my people and that I was the LORD their God.
Ezekiel,20,21,"But the children also rebelled against me. They refused to obey my laws and teachings, and they treated the Sabbath as any other day. I became angry and decided to punish them in the desert."
Ezekiel,20,22,But I did not. That would have disgraced me in front of the nations that had seen me bring the Israelites out of Egypt.
Ezekiel,20,23,"So I solemnly swore that I would scatter the people of Israel across the nations,"
Ezekiel,20,24,because they had disobeyed my laws and ignored my teachings; they had disgraced my Sabbath and worshipped the idols their ancestors had made.
Ezekiel,20,25,"I gave them laws that bring punishment instead of life,"
Ezekiel,20,26,"and I let them offer me unacceptable sacrifices, including their firstborn sons. I did this to horrify them and to let them know that I, the LORD , was punishing them."
Ezekiel,20,27,"Ezekiel, tell the people of Israel that their ancestors also rejected and insulted me"
Ezekiel,20,28,"by offering sacrifices, incense, and wine to gods on every hill and under every large tree. I was very angry, because they did these things in the land I had given them!"
Ezekiel,20,29,"I asked them where they went to worship those gods, and they answered, “At the local shrines.” And those places of worship are still called shrines."
Ezekiel,20,30,Then ask the Israelites why they are following the example of their wicked ancestors
Ezekiel,20,31,"by worshipping idols and by sacrificing their own children as offerings. They commit these sins and still think they can ask me for a message. As surely as I am the living LORD God, I will give them no answer."
Ezekiel,20,32,They may think they can be like other nations and get away with worshipping idols made of wood and stone. But that will never happen!
Ezekiel,20,33,"As surely as I am the living LORD God, I will rule over you with my powerful arm. You will feel my fierce anger"
Ezekiel,20,34,"and my power, when I gather you from the places where you are scattered"
Ezekiel,20,35,and lead you into a desert surrounded by nations. I will meet you there face to face. Then I will pass judgment on you
Ezekiel,20,36,"and punish you, just as I punished your ancestors in the desert near Egypt."
Ezekiel,20,37,I will force each of you to obey the regulations of our solemn agreement.
Ezekiel,20,38,"I will separate the sinful rebels from the rest of you, and even though I will bring them from the nations where they live in exile, they won't be allowed to return to Israel. Then you will know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,20,39,"Go ahead and worship your idols for now, you Israelites, because soon I will no longer let you dishonour me by offering gifts to them. You will have no choice but to obey me!"
Ezekiel,20,40,"When that day comes, everyone in Israel will worship me on Mount Zion, my holy mountain in Jerusalem. I will once again call you my own, and I will accept your sacred offerings and sacrifices."
Ezekiel,20,41,"When I bring you home from the places where you are now scattered, I will be pleased with you, just as I am pleased with the smell of the smoke from your sacrifices. Every nation on earth will see that I am holy,"
Ezekiel,20,42,"and you will know that I, the LORD , am the one who brought you back to Israel, the land I promised your ancestors."
Ezekiel,20,43,"Then you will remember your wicked sins, and you will hate yourselves for doing such horrible things. They have made you unacceptable to me,"
Ezekiel,20,44,"so you deserve to be punished. But I will treat you in a way that will bring honour to my name, and you will know that I am the LORD God."
Ezekiel,20,45,"The LORD said,"
Ezekiel,20,46,"“Ezekiel, son of man, turn towards the south and warn the forests"
Ezekiel,20,47,"that I, the LORD God, will start a fire that will burn up every tree, whether green or dry. Nothing will be able to put out the blaze of that fire as it spreads to the north and burns everything in its path."
Ezekiel,20,48,"Everyone will know that I started it, and that it cannot be stopped.”"
Ezekiel,20,49,"But I complained, “ LORD God, I don't want to do that! People already say I confuse them with my messages.”"
Ezekiel,21,1,The LORD said:
Ezekiel,21,2,"Ezekiel, son of man, condemn the places in Jerusalem where people worship. Warn everyone in Israel"
Ezekiel,21,3,"that I am about to punish them. I will pull out my sword and have it ready to kill everyone, whether good or evil."
Ezekiel,21,4,"From south to north, people will die,"
Ezekiel,21,5,knowing that my sword will never be put away.
Ezekiel,21,6,"Ezekiel, groan in sorrow and despair so that everyone can hear you."
Ezekiel,21,7,"When they ask why you are groaning, tell them you have terrifying news that will make them faint and tremble in fear and lose all courage. These things will happen soon. I, the LORD God, make this promise!"
Ezekiel,21,8,The LORD said:
Ezekiel,22,1,"Some time later, the LORD said:"
Ezekiel,22,2,"Ezekiel, son of man, are you ready to condemn Jerusalem? That city is filled with murderers, so remind the people of their sins"
Ezekiel,22,3,"and tell them I am saying: Jerusalem, you have murdered many of your own people and have worshipped idols. You will soon be punished!"
Ezekiel,22,4,"Those crimes have made you guilty, and the idols have made you unacceptable to me. So your final punishment is near. Other nations will laugh at you and make insulting remarks,"
Ezekiel,22,5,and people far and near will make fun of your misery.
Ezekiel,22,6,Your own leaders use their power to murder.
Ezekiel,22,7,"None of you honour your parents, and you cheat foreigners, orphans, and widows."
Ezekiel,22,8,You show no respect for my sacred places and treat the Sabbath just like any other day.
Ezekiel,22,9,"Some of your own people tell lies, so that others will be put to death. Some of you eat meat sacrificed to idols at local shrines, and others never stop doing vulgar things."
Ezekiel,22,10,Men have sex with their father's wife or with women who are having their monthly period
Ezekiel,22,11,or with someone else's wife. Some men even sleep with their own daughter-in-law or half-sister.
Ezekiel,22,12,"Others of you accept money to murder someone. Your own people charge high interest when making a loan to other Israelites, and they get rich by cheating. Worst of all, you have forgotten me, the LORD God."
Ezekiel,22,13,I will shake my fist in anger at your violent crimes.
Ezekiel,22,14,"When I've finished with you, your courage will disappear, and you will be so weak that you won't be able to lift your hands. I, the LORD , have spoken and will not change my mind."
Ezekiel,22,15,I will scatter you throughout every nation on earth and put a stop to your sinful ways.
Ezekiel,22,16,"You will be humiliated in the eyes of other nations. Then you will know that I, the LORD God, have done these things."
Ezekiel,22,17,The LORD said:
Ezekiel,22,18,"Ezekiel, son of man, I consider the people of Israel as worthless as the leftover metal in a furnace after silver has been purified."
Ezekiel,22,19,So I am going to bring them together in Jerusalem.
Ezekiel,23,1,The LORD said:
Ezekiel,23,2,"Ezekiel, son of man, listen to this story about two sisters."
Ezekiel,23,3,"While they were young and living in Egypt, they became prostitutes."
Ezekiel,23,4,"The elder one was named Oholah, which stands for Samaria; the younger one was Oholibah, which stands for Jerusalem. They became my wives and gave birth to my children."
Ezekiel,23,5,"Even though Oholah was my wife, she continued to be a prostitute and chased after Assyrian lovers."
Ezekiel,23,6,"She offered herself to soldiers in purple uniforms, to every handsome, high-ranking officer, and to cavalry troops."
Ezekiel,23,7,She had sex with all the important Assyrian officials and even worshipped their disgusting idols.
Ezekiel,23,8,"Once she started doing these things in Egypt, she never stopped. Men slept with her, and she was always ready for sex."
Ezekiel,23,9,So I gave Oholah to the Assyrian lovers she wanted so badly.
Ezekiel,23,10,"They ripped off her clothes, then captured her children and killed her. Women everywhere talked about what had happened to Oholah."
Ezekiel,23,11,"Oholibah saw all this, but she was more sinful and wanted sex more than her sister Oholah ever did."
Ezekiel,23,12,"Oholibah also chased after good-looking Assyrian officers, uniformed soldiers, and cavalry troops."
Ezekiel,23,13,"Just like her sister, she did vulgar things."
Ezekiel,23,14,But Oholibah behaved worse than her sister. Oholibah saw images of Babylonian men carved into walls and painted red.
Ezekiel,23,15,"They had belts around their waists and large turbans on their heads, and they reminded her of Babylonian cavalry officers."
Ezekiel,23,16,"As soon as she looked at them, she wanted to have sex with them. And so, she sent messengers to bring them to her."
Ezekiel,23,17,Men from Babylonia came and had sex with her so many times that she got disgusted with them.
Ezekiel,23,18,"She let everyone see her naked body and didn't care if they knew she was a prostitute. That's why I turned my back on her, just as I had done with her elder sister."
Ezekiel,23,19,"Oholibah didn't stop there, but became even more immoral and acted as she had back in Egypt."
Ezekiel,23,20,"She eagerly wanted to go to bed with Egyptian men, who were famous for their sexual powers."
Ezekiel,23,21,"And she longed for the days when she was a young prostitute, when men enjoyed having sex with her."
Ezekiel,23,22,"The LORD God said: Oholibah, though you no longer want to be with your lovers, they will surround you like enemies, when I turn them against you."
Ezekiel,23,23,"I will gather all the handsome young officials and the high-ranking cavalry officers from Babylonia and Assyria, as well as from the Chaldean tribes of Pekod, Shoa, and Koa."
Ezekiel,23,24,"Their large armies will come from the north with chariots and wagons carrying weapons. They will wear shields and helmets and will surround you, and I will let them judge and sentence you according to their own laws."
Ezekiel,23,25,"I am angry with you, so I will let them be very cruel. They will cut off your nose and ears; they will kill your children and put to death anyone in your family who is still alive."
Ezekiel,23,26,Your clothes and jewellery will be torn off.
Ezekiel,23,27,I will stop your wickedness and the prostitution you started back in Egypt. You will never want to think about those days again.
Ezekiel,23,28,"I, the LORD God, am ready to hand you over to those hateful enemies that you find so disgusting."
Ezekiel,23,29,They will cruelly take away everything you have worked for and strip you naked. Then everyone will see you for the prostitute you really are. Your own vulgar sins
Ezekiel,23,30,have led to this. You were the one determined to have sex with men from other nations and to worship their idols.
Ezekiel,23,31,"You have turned out no better than your elder sister, and now you must drink from the cup filled with my anger."
Ezekiel,23,32,"I, the LORD God, gave your sister a large, deep cup filled with my anger. And when you drink from that cup, you will be mocked and insulted."
Ezekiel,23,33,"You will end up drunk and devastated, because that cup is filled with horror and ruin."
Ezekiel,23,34,"But you must drink every drop! Then smash the cup to pieces and use them to cut your breasts in sorrow. I, the LORD God, have spoken."
Ezekiel,23,35,"You have completely rejected me, and so I promise that you will be punished for the disgusting things you did as a prostitute."
Ezekiel,23,36,"The LORD said: Ezekiel, son of man, it's time for you to tell Oholah and Oholibah that they are guilty. Remind them of their evil ways!"
Ezekiel,23,37,"They have been unfaithful by worshipping idols, and they have committed murder by sacrificing my own children as offerings to idols."
Ezekiel,24,1,"Nine years after King Jehoiachin and the rest of us had been led away as prisoners to Babylonia, the LORD spoke to me on the tenth day of the tenth month. He said:"
Ezekiel,24,2,"Ezekiel, son of man, write down today's date, because the king of Babylonia has just begun attacking the city of Jerusalem."
Ezekiel,24,3,Then tell my rebellious people: “Pour water in a cooking pot and set it over a fire.
Ezekiel,25,1,The LORD God said:
Ezekiel,25,2,"Ezekiel, son of man, condemn the people of Ammon"
Ezekiel,25,3,"and tell them: You celebrated when my temple was destroyed, when Israel was defeated, and when my people were taken away as prisoners."
Ezekiel,25,4,Now I am going to let you be conquered by tribes from the eastern desert. They will set up their camps in your land and eat your fruit and drink your milk.
Ezekiel,25,5,"Your capital city of Rabbah will be nothing but pasture land for camels, and the rest of the country will be pastures for sheep. Then you will know that I am the LORD God."
Ezekiel,25,6,You hated Israel so much that you clapped and shouted and celebrated.
Ezekiel,25,7,"And so I will hand you over to enemies who will rob you. I will completely destroy you. There won't be enough of your people left to be a nation ever again, and you will know that I, the LORD , have done these things."
Ezekiel,25,8,"The LORD God said, “The people of Moab thought Judah was no different from any other nation."
Ezekiel,25,9,"So I will let Moab's fortress towns along its border be attacked, including Beth-Jeshimoth, Baal-Meon, and Kiriathaim."
Ezekiel,25,10,"The same eastern desert tribes that invade Ammon will invade Moab, and just as Ammon will be forgotten for ever,"
Ezekiel,25,11,Moab will be punished. Then the people there will know that I am the LORD .”
Ezekiel,25,12,"The LORD God then said, “The people of Edom are guilty of taking revenge on Judah."
Ezekiel,25,13,So I will punish Edom by killing all its people and livestock. It will be an empty wasteland all the way from Teman to Dedan.
Ezekiel,25,14,"I will send my own people to take revenge on the Edomites by making them feel my fierce anger. And when I punish them, they will know that I am the LORD God.”"
Ezekiel,25,15,"The LORD God said, “The cruel Philistines have taken revenge on their enemies over and over and have tried to destroy them."
Ezekiel,25,16,Now it's my turn to treat the Philistines as my enemies and to kill everyone living in their towns along the coast.
Ezekiel,25,17,"In my fierce anger, I will take revenge on them. And when I punish them, they will know that I am the LORD .”"
Ezekiel,26,1,"Eleven years after King Jehoiachin and the rest of us had been led away as prisoners to Babylonia, the LORD spoke to me on the first day of the month. He said:"
Ezekiel,26,2,"Ezekiel, son of man, the people of the city of Tyre have celebrated Jerusalem's defeat by singing, “Jerusalem has fallen! It used to be powerful, a centre of trade. Now the city is shattered, and we will take its place.”"
Ezekiel,26,3,"Because the people of Tyre have sung that song, I have the following warning for them: I am the LORD God, and I am now your enemy! I will send nations to attack you, like waves crashing against the shore."
Ezekiel,26,4,"They will tear down your city walls and defence towers. I will sweep away the ruins until all that's left of you is a bare rock,"
Ezekiel,26,5,where fishermen can dry their nets along the coast. I promise that you will be robbed
Ezekiel,26,6,and that the people who live in your towns along the coast will be killed. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel,26,7,"King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia is the world's most powerful king, and I will send him to attack you. He will march from the north with a powerful army, including horses and chariots and cavalry troops."
Ezekiel,26,8,"First, he will attack your towns along the coast and kill the people who live there. Then he will build earth ramps up to the top of your city walls and set up rows of shields around you."
Ezekiel,26,9,"He will command some of his troops to use large wooden poles to beat down your walls, while others use iron rods to knock down your watchtowers."
Ezekiel,26,10,"He will have so many horses that the dust they stir up will seem like a thick fog. And as his chariots and cavalry approach, even the walls will shake, especially when he proudly enters your ruined city."
Ezekiel,26,11,"His troops will ride through your streets, killing people left and right, and your strong columns will crumble to the ground."
Ezekiel,26,12,"The troops will steal your valuable possessions; they will break down your walls, and crush your expensive houses. Then the stones and wood and all the remains will be dumped into the sea."
Ezekiel,26,13,"You will have no reason to sing or play music on harps,"
Ezekiel,26,14,"because I will turn you into a bare rock where fishermen can dry their nets. And you will never rebuild your city. I, the LORD God, make this promise."
Ezekiel,26,15,The people of the nations up and down the coast will shudder when they hear your screams and moans of death.
Ezekiel,26,16,"The kings will step down from their thrones, then take off their royal robes and fine clothes, and sit on the ground, trembling. They will be so shocked at the news of your defeat that they will shake in fear"
Ezekiel,26,17,and sing this funeral song: “The great city beside the sea is destroyed! Its people once ruled the coast and terrified everyone there.
Ezekiel,26,18,"But now Tyre is in ruins, and the people on the coast stare at it in horror and tremble in fear.”"
Ezekiel,26,19,"I, the LORD God, will turn you into a ghost town. The ocean depths will rise over you"
Ezekiel,26,20,"and carry you down to the world of the dead, where you will join people of ancient times and towns ruined long ago. You will stay there and never again be a city filled with people."
Ezekiel,26,21,"You will die a horrible death! People will come looking for your city, but it will never be found. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Ezekiel,27,1,The LORD said:
Ezekiel,27,2,"Ezekiel, son of man, sing a funeral song for Tyre,"
Ezekiel,27,3,"the city that is built along the sea and that trades with nations along the coast. Tell the people of Tyre that the following message is from me: Tyre, you boast about your perfect beauty,"
Ezekiel,27,4,and your control of the sea. You are a ship built to perfection.
Ezekiel,27,5,Builders used cypress trees from Mount Hermon to make your planks and a cedar tree from Lebanon for your tall mast.
Ezekiel,27,6,"Oak trees from Bashan were shaped into oars; pine trees from Cyprus were cut for your deck, which was then decorated with strips of ivory."
Ezekiel,27,7,"The builders used fine linen from Egypt for your sails, so everyone could see you. Blue and purple cloth from Cyprus was used to shade your deck."
Ezekiel,27,8,"Men from Sidon and Arvad did the rowing, and your own skilled workers were the captains."
Ezekiel,27,9,Experienced men from Byblos repaired any damages. Sailors from all over shopped at the stores in your port.
Ezekiel,27,10,"Brave soldiers from Persia, Lydia, and Libya served in your navy, protecting you with shields and helmets, and making you famous."
Ezekiel,27,11,"Your guards came from Arvad and Cilicia, and men from Gamad stood watch in your towers. With their weapons hung on your walls, your beauty was complete."
Ezekiel,27,12,"Merchants from southern Spain traded silver, iron, tin, and lead for your products."
Ezekiel,27,13,"The people of Greece, Tubal, and Meshech traded slaves and things made of bronze,"
Ezekiel,27,14,"and those from Beth-Togarmah traded work horses, war horses, and mules."
Ezekiel,27,15,"You also did business with people from Rhodes, and people from nations along the coast gave you ivory and ebony in exchange for your goods."
Ezekiel,27,16,"Edom traded emeralds, purple cloth, embroidery, fine linen, coral, and rubies."
Ezekiel,27,17,"Judah and Israel gave you their finest wheat, best figs, honey, olive oil, and spices in exchange for your merchandise."
Ezekiel,27,18,The people of Damascus saw what you had to offer and brought you wine from Helbon and wool from Zahar.
Ezekiel,27,19,Vedan and Javan near Uzal traded you iron and spices.
Ezekiel,27,20,"The people of Dedan supplied you with saddle blankets,"
Ezekiel,27,21,"while people from Arabia and the rulers of Kedar traded lambs, sheep, and goats."
Ezekiel,27,22,"Merchants from Sheba and Raamah gave you excellent spices, precious stones, and gold in exchange for your products."
Ezekiel,27,23,"You also did business with merchants from the cities of Haran, Canneh, Eden, Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad,"
Ezekiel,27,24,"and they gave you expensive clothing, purple and embroidered cloth, brightly-coloured rugs, and strong rope."
Ezekiel,27,25,"Large, seagoing ships carried your goods wherever they needed to go. You were like a ship loaded with heavy cargo"
Ezekiel,27,26,"and sailing across the sea, but you were wrecked by strong eastern winds."
Ezekiel,27,27,"Everything on board was lost— your valuable cargo, your sailors and carpenters, merchants and soldiers."
Ezekiel,27,28,The shouts of your drowning crew were heard on the shore.
Ezekiel,27,29,"Every ship is deserted; rowers and sailors and captains all stand on shore,"
Ezekiel,27,30,mourning for you. They show their sorrow by putting dust on their heads and rolling in ashes;
Ezekiel,27,31,they shave their heads and dress in sackcloth as they cry in despair.
Ezekiel,27,32,"In their grief they sing a funeral song for you: “Tyre, you were greater than all other cities. But now you lie in silence at the bottom of the sea."
Ezekiel,27,33,“Nations that received your merchandise were always pleased; kings everywhere got rich from your costly goods.
Ezekiel,27,34,"But now you are wrecked in the deep sea, with your cargo and crew scattered everywhere."
Ezekiel,27,35,"People living along the coast are shocked at the news. Their rulers are horrified, and terror is written across their faces."
Ezekiel,27,36,"The merchants of the world can't believe what happened. Your death was gruesome, and you are gone for ever.”"
Ezekiel,28,1,The LORD God said:
Ezekiel,28,2,"Ezekiel, son of man, tell the king of Tyre that I am saying: You are so arrogant that you think you're a god and that the city of Tyre is your throne. You may claim to be a god, though you're nothing but a mere human."
Ezekiel,28,3,You think you're wiser than Daniel and know everything.
Ezekiel,28,4,"Your wisdom has certainly made you rich, because you have storehouses filled with gold and silver."
Ezekiel,28,5,"You're a clever businessman and are extremely wealthy, but your wealth has led to arrogance!"
Ezekiel,28,6,"You compared yourself to a god, so now I, the LORD God,"
Ezekiel,28,7,will make you the victim of cruel enemies. They will destroy all the possessions you've worked so hard to get.
Ezekiel,28,8,"Your enemies will brutally kill you, and the sea will be your only grave."
Ezekiel,28,9,"When you face your enemies, will you still claim to be a god? They will attack, and you will suffer like any other human."
Ezekiel,28,10,"Foreigners will kill you, and you will die the death of those who don't worship me. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Ezekiel,28,11,The LORD said:
Ezekiel,28,12,"Ezekiel, son of man, sing a funeral song for the king of Tyre and tell him I am saying: At one time, you were perfect, intelligent, and good-looking."
Ezekiel,28,13,You lived in the garden of Eden and wore jewellery made of brightly-coloured gems and precious stones. They were all set in gold and were ready for you on the day you were born.
Ezekiel,28,14,"I appointed a winged creature to guard your home on my holy mountain, where you walked among gems that dazzled like fire."
Ezekiel,28,15,"You were truly good from the time of your birth, but later you started doing wicked things."
Ezekiel,28,16,"You traded with other nations and became more and more cruel and evil. So I forced you to leave my mountain, and the creature that had been your protector now chased you away from the gems."
Ezekiel,28,17,"It was your good looks that made you arrogant, and you were so famous that you started acting like a fool. That's why I threw you to the ground and let other kings sneer at you."
Ezekiel,28,18,"You have cheated so many other merchants that your places of worship are corrupt. So I set your city on fire and burnt it down. Now everyone sees only ashes where your city once stood,"
Ezekiel,28,19,"and the people of other nations are shocked. Your punishment was horrible, and you are gone for ever."
Ezekiel,28,20,The LORD said:
Ezekiel,28,21,"Ezekiel, son of man, condemn the city of Sidon"
Ezekiel,28,22,"and tell its people: I, the LORD God, am your enemy! People will praise me when I punish you, and they will see that I am holy."
Ezekiel,28,23,"I will send deadly diseases to wipe you out, and I will send enemies to invade and surround you. Your people will be killed, and you will know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,28,24,"When that happens, the people of Israel will no longer have cruel neighbours that abuse them and make them feel as though they are in a field of thorns and briers. And the Israelites will know that I, the LORD God, have done these things."
Ezekiel,28,25,"The LORD God said: Some day I will gather the people of Israel from the nations where they are now scattered, and every nation will see that I am holy. The Israelites will once again live in the land I gave to my servant Jacob."
Ezekiel,28,26,"They will be safe and will build houses and plant vineyards. They will no longer be in danger, because I will punish their hateful neighbours. Israel will know that I am the LORD their God."
Ezekiel,29,1,"Ten years after King Jehoiachin and the rest of us had been led away as prisoners to Babylonia, the LORD spoke to me on the twelfth day of the tenth month. He said:"
Ezekiel,29,2,"Ezekiel, son of man, condemn the king of Egypt. Tell him and his people"
Ezekiel,29,3,"that I am saying: King of Egypt, you were like a giant crocodile lying in a river. You acted as though you owned the Nile and made it for yourself. But now I, the LORD God, am your enemy!"
Ezekiel,29,4,"I will put a hook in your jaw and pull you out of the water, and all the fish in your river will stick to your scaly body."
Ezekiel,29,5,"I'll throw you and the fish into the desert, and your body will fall on the hard ground. You will be left unburied, and wild animals and birds will eat your flesh."
Ezekiel,29,6,Then everyone in Egypt will know that I am the LORD. You and your nation refused to help the people of Israel and were nothing more than a broken stick.
Ezekiel,29,7,"When they reached out to you for support, you broke in half, cutting their arms and making them fall."
Ezekiel,29,8,"So I, the LORD God, will send troops to attack you, king of Egypt. They will kill your people and livestock,"
Ezekiel,29,9,until your land is a barren desert. Then you will know that I have done these things. You claimed that you made the River Nile and control it.
Ezekiel,29,10,"Now I am turning against you and your river. Your nation will be nothing but an empty wasteland all the way from the town of Migdol in the north to Aswan in the south, and as far as the border of Ethiopia."
Ezekiel,29,11,"No human or animal will even dare travel through Egypt, because no sign of life will be found there for forty years."
Ezekiel,29,12,"It will be the most barren place on earth. Every city in Egypt will lie in ruins during those forty years, and I will scatter your people throughout the nations of the world."
Ezekiel,29,13,"Then after those forty years have passed, I will bring your people back from the places where I scattered them."
Ezekiel,29,14,They will once again live in their homeland in southern Egypt. But they will be a weak kingdom
Ezekiel,29,15,"and won't ever be strong enough to rule nations, as they did in the past."
Ezekiel,29,16,"My own people Israel will never again depend on your nation. In fact, when the Israelites remember what happened to you Egyptians, they will realize how wrong they were to turn to you for help. Then the Israelites will know that I, the LORD God, did these things."
Ezekiel,29,17,"Twenty-seven years after King Jehoiachin and the rest of us had been led away as prisoners to Babylonia, the LORD spoke to me on the first day of the first month. He said:"
Ezekiel,29,18,"King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia has attacked the city of Tyre. He forced his soldiers to carry so many heavy loads that their heads were rubbed bald, and their shoulders were red and sore. Nebuchadnezzar and his army still could not capture the city."
Ezekiel,29,19,So now I will hand over the nation of Egypt to him. He will take Egypt's valuable treasures and give them to his own troops.
Ezekiel,29,20,"Egypt will be his reward, because he and his army have been following my orders. I, the LORD God, have spoken."
Ezekiel,29,21,"Ezekiel, when Egypt is defeated, I will make the people of Israel strong, and I will give you the power to speak to them. Then they will know that I, the LORD , have done these things."
Ezekiel,30,1,The LORD said:
Ezekiel,30,2,"Ezekiel, son of man, tell the people of Egypt that I am saying: Cry out in despair,"
Ezekiel,30,3,because you will soon be punished! That will be a time of darkness and doom for all nations.
Ezekiel,30,4,"Your own nation of Egypt will be attacked, and Ethiopia will suffer. You will be killed in battle, and your land will be robbed and left in ruins."
Ezekiel,30,5,"Soldiers hired from Ethiopia, Libya, Lydia, Arabia, Kub, as well as from Israel, will die in that battle."
Ezekiel,30,6,"All your allies will be killed, and your proud strength will crumble. People will die from Migdol in the north to Aswan in the south. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Ezekiel,30,7,"Your nation of Egypt will be the most deserted place on earth, and its cities will lie in complete ruin."
Ezekiel,30,8,"I will set fire to your land, and anyone who defended your nation will die. Then you will know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,30,9,"On the same day I destroy Egypt, I will send messengers to the Ethiopians to announce their coming destruction. They think they are safe, but they will be terrified."
Ezekiel,30,10,"Your Egyptian army is very strong, but I will send King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia to completely defeat that army."
Ezekiel,30,11,He and his cruel troops will invade and destroy your land and leave your dead bodies piled everywhere.
Ezekiel,30,12,"I will dry up the River Nile, then sell the land to evil buyers. I will send foreigners to turn your entire nation into a barren desert. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Ezekiel,30,13,"All the idols and images you Egyptians worship in the city of Memphis will be smashed. No one will be left to rule your nation, and terror will fill the land."
Ezekiel,30,14,"The city of Pathros will be left in ruins, and Zoan will be burnt to the ground. Thebes, your capital city, will also be destroyed!"
Ezekiel,30,15,"The fortress city of Pelusium will feel my fierce anger, and all the troops stationed at Thebes will be slaughtered."
Ezekiel,30,16,"I will set fire to your nation of Egypt! The city of Pelusium will be in anguish. Thebes will fall, and the people of Memphis will live in constant fear."
Ezekiel,30,17,"The young soldiers in the cities of Heliopolis and Bubastis will die in battle, and the rest of the people will be taken prisoner."
Ezekiel,30,18,"You were so proud of your nation's power, but when I crush that power and kill that pride, darkness will fall over the city of Tahpanhes. A dark, gloomy cloud will cover the land as you are being led away into captivity."
Ezekiel,30,19,"When I've finished punishing Egypt, you will know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,30,20,"Eleven years after King Jehoiachin and the rest of us had been led away as prisoners to Babylonia, the LORD spoke to me on the seventh day of the first month. He said:"
Ezekiel,30,21,"Ezekiel, son of man, I, the LORD , have defeated the king of Egypt! I broke his arm, and no one has wrapped it or put it in a sling, so that it could heal and get strong enough to hold a sword."
Ezekiel,30,22,"So tell him that I am now his worst enemy. I will break both his arms—the good one and the broken one! His sword will drop from his hand for ever,"
Ezekiel,30,23,and I will scatter the Egyptians all over the world.
Ezekiel,31,1,"Eleven years after King Jehoiachin and the rest of us had been led away as prisoners to Babylonia, the LORD spoke to me on the first day of the third month. He said:"
Ezekiel,31,2,"Ezekiel, son of man, tell the king of Egypt and his people that I am saying: You are more powerful than anyone on earth. Now listen to this."
Ezekiel,31,3,"There was once a cedar tree in Lebanon with large, strong branches reaching to the sky."
Ezekiel,31,4,"This tree had plenty of water to help it grow tall, and nearby streams watered the other trees in the forest."
Ezekiel,31,5,"But this tree towered over those other trees, and its branches grew long and thick."
Ezekiel,31,6,"Birds built nests in its branches, and animals were born beneath it. People from all nations lived in the shade of this strong tree."
Ezekiel,31,7,"It had beautiful, long branches, and its roots found water deep in the soil."
Ezekiel,31,8,None of the cedar trees in my garden of Eden were as beautiful as this tree; no tree of any kind had such long branches.
Ezekiel,31,9,"I, the LORD , gave this tree its beauty, and I helped the branches grow strong. All other trees in Eden wanted to be just like it."
Ezekiel,31,10,"King of Egypt, now listen to what I, the LORD God, am saying about that tree: The tree grew so tall that it reached the sky and became very proud and arrogant."
Ezekiel,31,11,"So I, the LORD God, will reject the tree and hand it over to a foreign ruler, who will punish it for its wickedness."
Ezekiel,31,12,Cruel foreigners will chop it down and leave it wherever it falls. Branches and broken limbs will be scattered over the mountains and in the valleys. The people living in the shade of those branches will go somewhere else.
Ezekiel,31,13,"Birds will then nest on the stump of the fallen tree, and wild animals will trample its branches."
Ezekiel,31,14,"Never again will any tree dare to grow as tall as this tree, no matter how much water it has. Every tree must die, just as humans die and go down to the world of the dead."
Ezekiel,31,15,"On the day this tree dies and goes to the world below, I, the LORD God, will command rivers and streams to mourn its death. Every underground spring of water and every river will stop flowing. The mountains in Lebanon will be covered with darkness as a sign of their sorrow, and all the trees in the forest will wither."
Ezekiel,31,16,"This tree will crash to the ground, and I will send it to the world below. Then the nations of the earth will tremble. The trees from Eden and the choice trees from Lebanon are now in the world of the dead, and they will be comforted when this tree falls."
Ezekiel,31,17,"Those people who found protection in its shade will also be sent to the world below, where they will join the dead."
Ezekiel,31,18,"King of Egypt, all these things will happen to you and your people! You were like this tree at one time—taller and stronger than anyone on earth. But now you will be chopped down, just as every tree in the garden of Eden must die. You will be sent down to the world of the dead, where you will join the godless and the other victims of violent death. I, the LORD God, have spoken."
Ezekiel,32,1,"Twelve years after King Jehoiachin and the rest of us had been led away as prisoners to Babylonia, the LORD spoke to me on the first day of the twelfth month. He said:"
Ezekiel,32,2,"Ezekiel, son of man, condemn the king of Egypt and tell him I am saying: You act like a lion roaming the earth; but you are nothing more than a crocodile in a river, churning up muddy water with your feet."
Ezekiel,32,3,"King of Egypt, listen to me. I, the LORD God, will catch you in my net and let a crowd of foreigners drag you to shore."
Ezekiel,32,4,"I will throw you into an open field, where birds and animals will come to feed on your body."
Ezekiel,32,5,"I will spread your rotting flesh over the mountains and in the valleys,"
Ezekiel,32,6,and your blood will flow throughout the land and fill up the streams.
Ezekiel,32,7,"I will cover the whole sky and every star with thick clouds, so that the sun and moon will stop shining."
Ezekiel,32,8,"The heavens will become black, leaving your country in total darkness. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Ezekiel,32,9,Foreign nations you have never heard of will be shocked when I tell them how I destroyed you.
Ezekiel,32,10,"They will be horrified, and when I flash my sword in victory on the day of your death, their kings will tremble in the fear of what could happen to them."
Ezekiel,32,11,"The king of Babylonia is coming to attack you, king of Egypt!"
Ezekiel,32,12,"Your soldiers will be killed by the cruellest army in the world, and everything you take pride in will be crushed."
Ezekiel,32,13,"I will slaughter your cattle that graze by the river, and no people or livestock will be left to muddy its water."
Ezekiel,32,14,"The water will be clear, and streams will be calm. I, the LORD God, have spoken."
Ezekiel,32,15,"Egypt will become a barren wasteland, and no living thing will ever survive there. Then you and your people will know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,32,16,"This is your warning, and it will be used as a funeral song by foreign women to mourn the death of your people. I, the LORD God, have spoken."
Ezekiel,32,17,"On the fifteenth day of that same month, the LORD said:"
Ezekiel,32,18,"Ezekiel, son of man, mourn for the Egyptians and condemn them to the world of the dead, where they will be buried beside the people of other powerful nations."
Ezekiel,32,19,"Say to them: You may be more beautiful than the people of other nations, but you will also die and join the godless in the world below."
Ezekiel,32,20,You cannot escape! The enemy's sword is ready to slaughter every one of you.
Ezekiel,32,21,Brave military leaders killed in battle will gladly welcome you and your allies into the world of the dead.
Ezekiel,33,1,The LORD said:
Ezekiel,33,2,"Ezekiel, son of man, warn your people by saying: Some day, I, the LORD , may send an enemy to invade a country. And suppose its people choose someone to stand watch"
Ezekiel,33,3,and to sound a warning signal when the enemy is seen coming.
Ezekiel,34,1,The LORD God said:
Ezekiel,34,2,"Ezekiel, son of man, Israel's leaders are like shepherds taking care of my sheep, the people of Israel. But I want you to condemn these leaders and tell them: I, the LORD God, say you shepherds of Israel are doomed! You take care of yourselves while ignoring my sheep."
Ezekiel,34,3,You drink their milk and use their wool to make your clothes. Then you butcher the best ones for food. But you don't take care of the flock!
Ezekiel,34,4,You have never protected the weak ones or healed the sick ones or bandaged those that get hurt. You let them wander off and never look for those that get lost. You are cruel and mean to my sheep.
Ezekiel,34,5,"They strayed in every direction, and because there was no shepherd to watch them, they were attacked and eaten by wild animals."
Ezekiel,34,6,"So my sheep were scattered across the earth. They roamed on hills and mountains, without anyone even bothering to look for them."
Ezekiel,35,1,The LORD said:
Ezekiel,35,2,"Ezekiel, son of man, condemn the people of Edom"
Ezekiel,35,3,"and say to them: I, the LORD God, am now your enemy! And I will turn your nation into an empty wasteland,"
Ezekiel,35,4,"leaving your towns in ruins. Your land will be a desert, and then you will know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,35,5,"People of Edom, not only have you been Israel's longtime enemy, you simply watched when disaster wiped out its people as punishment for their sins."
Ezekiel,35,6,"And so, as surely as I am the living LORD God, you are guilty of murder and must be put to death."
Ezekiel,35,7,I will destroy your nation and kill anyone who travels through it.
Ezekiel,35,8,"Dead bodies will cover your mountains and fill up your valleys,"
Ezekiel,35,9,and your land will lie in ruins for ever. No one will live in your towns ever again. You will know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel,35,10,"You thought the nations of Judah and Israel belonged to you, and that you could take over their territory. But I am their God,"
Ezekiel,35,11,"and as surely as I live, I will punish you for treating my people with anger and hatred. Then they will know that I, the LORD , am punishing you!"
Ezekiel,35,12,And you will finally realize that I heard you laugh at their destruction and say their land was yours to take.
Ezekiel,35,13,"You even insulted me, but I heard it all."
Ezekiel,35,14,"Everyone on earth will celebrate when I destroy you,"
Ezekiel,35,15,just as you celebrated when Israel was destroyed. Your nation of Edom will be nothing but a wasteland. Then everyone will know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel,36,1,"The LORD said: Ezekiel, son of man, tell the mountains of Israel"
Ezekiel,36,2,"that I, the LORD God, am saying: Your enemies sneered and said that you mountains belonged to them."
Ezekiel,36,3,"They ruined and crushed you from every side, and foreign nations captured and made fun of you."
Ezekiel,36,4,"So all you mountains and hills, streams and valleys, listen to what I will do. Your towns may now lie in ruins, and nations may laugh and insult you."
Ezekiel,36,5,"But in my fierce anger, I will turn against those nations, and especially the Edomites, because they laughed at you the loudest and took over your pasture lands."
Ezekiel,36,6,"You have suffered long enough, and, I, the LORD God, am very angry! Nations have insulted you,"
Ezekiel,36,7,so I will now insult and disgrace them. That is my solemn promise.
Ezekiel,36,8,"Trees will grow on you mountains of Israel and produce fruit for my people, because they will soon come home."
Ezekiel,36,9,I will take care of you by ploughing your soil and planting crops on your fertile slopes.
Ezekiel,36,10,The people of Israel will return and rebuild your ruined towns and live in them.
Ezekiel,36,11,"Children will be born, and animals will give birth to their young. You will no longer be deserted as you are now, but you will be covered with people and treated better than ever. Then you will know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,36,12,"I will bring my people Israel home, and they will live on you mountains, because you belong to them, and your fertile slopes will never again let them starve."
Ezekiel,36,13,It's true that you have been accused of not producing enough food and of letting your people starve.
Ezekiel,37,1,"Some time later, I felt the LORD 's power take control of me, and his Spirit carried me to a valley full of bones."
Ezekiel,37,2,"The LORD showed me all around, and everywhere I looked I saw bones that were dried out."
Ezekiel,37,3,"He said, “Ezekiel, son of man, can these bones come back to life?” I replied, “ LORD God, only you can answer that.”"
Ezekiel,37,4,"He then told me to say: Dry bones, listen to what the LORD is saying to you,"
Ezekiel,37,5,"“I, the LORD God, will put breath in you, and once again you will live."
Ezekiel,37,6,I will wrap you with muscles and skin and breathe life into you. Then you will know that I am the LORD .”
Ezekiel,37,7,"I did what the LORD said, but before I finished speaking, I heard a rattling noise. The bones were coming together!"
Ezekiel,37,8,"I saw muscles and skin cover the bones, but they had no life in them."
Ezekiel,37,9,"The LORD said: Ezekiel, now say to the wind, “The LORD God commands you to blow from every direction and to breathe life into these dead bodies, so they can live again.”"
Ezekiel,37,10,"As soon as I said this, the wind blew among the bodies, and they came back to life! They all stood up, and there were enough to make a large army."
Ezekiel,37,11,"The LORD said: Ezekiel, the people of Israel are like dead bones. They complain that they are dried up and that they have no hope for the future."
Ezekiel,37,12,"So tell them, “I, the LORD God, promise to open your graves and set you free. I will bring you back to Israel,"
Ezekiel,37,13,"and when that happens, you will realize that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,37,14,"My Spirit will give you breath, and you will live again. I will bring you home, and you will know that I have kept my promise. I, the LORD , have spoken.”"
Ezekiel,37,15,The LORD said:
Ezekiel,37,16,"Ezekiel, son of man, get a stick and write on it, “The kingdom of Judah”. Then get another stick and write on it, “The kingdom of Israel”."
Ezekiel,37,17,"Hold these two sticks end to end, so they look like one stick."
Ezekiel,37,18,"And when your people ask you what this means,"
Ezekiel,37,19,"tell them that I, the LORD , will join together the stick of Israel and the stick of Judah. I will hold them in my hand, and they will become one."
Ezekiel,37,20,Hold these two sticks where they can be seen by everyone
Ezekiel,37,21,"and then say: I, the LORD God, will gather the people of Israel and bring them home from the foreign nations where they now live."
Ezekiel,37,22,"I will make them into one nation and let them once again live in the land of Israel. Only one king will rule them, and they will never again be divided into two nations."
Ezekiel,37,23,"They will no longer worship idols and do things that make them unacceptable to me. I will wash away their sin and make them clean, and I will protect them from everything that makes them unclean. They will be my people, and I will be their God."
Ezekiel,38,1,The LORD said:
Ezekiel,38,2,"Ezekiel, son of man, condemn Gog, that wicked ruler of the kingdoms of Meshech and Tubal in the land of Magog. Tell him:"
Ezekiel,38,3,"I, the LORD God, am your enemy,"
Ezekiel,38,4,and I will make you powerless! I will put a hook in your jaw and drag away both you and your large army. You command cavalry troops that wear heavy armour and carry shields and swords.
Ezekiel,38,5,"Your army includes soldiers from Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya,"
Ezekiel,38,6,as well as from Gomer and Beth-Togarmah in the north. Your army is enormous!
Ezekiel,38,7,"So keep your troops prepared to fight,"
Ezekiel,38,8,"because in a few years, I will command you to invade Israel, a country that was ruined by war. It was deserted for a long time, but its people have returned from the foreign nations where they once lived. The Israelites now live in peace in the mountains of their own land."
Ezekiel,38,9,But you and your army will attack them like a fierce thunderstorm and surround them like a cloud.
Ezekiel,38,10,"When that day comes, I know that you will have an evil plan"
Ezekiel,38,11,"to take advantage of Israel, that weak and peaceful country where people live safely inside towns that have no walls or gates or locks."
Ezekiel,38,12,"You will rob the people in towns that were once a pile of rubble. These people lived as prisoners in foreign nations, but they have returned to Israel, the most important place in the world, and they own livestock and property."
Ezekiel,38,13,"The people of Sheba and Dedan, along with merchants from villages in southern Spain, will be your allies. They will want some of the silver and gold, as well as the livestock and property that your army takes from Israel."
Ezekiel,38,14,"I, the LORD God, know that when you see my people Israel living in peace,"
Ezekiel,38,15,you will lead your powerful cavalry from your kingdom in the north.
Ezekiel,38,16,"You will attack my people like a storm cloud that covers their land. I will let you invade my country Israel, so that every nation on earth will know that I, the LORD , am holy."
Ezekiel,38,17,"The LORD said to Gog: Long ago, I made my prophets warn the people of Israel that some day I would send an enemy to attack them. You, Gog, are that enemy, and that day is coming."
Ezekiel,38,18,"When you invade Israel, I will become furious,"
Ezekiel,38,19,and in my anger I will send a terrible earthquake to shake Israel.
Ezekiel,38,20,"Every living thing on earth will tremble in fear of me—every fish and bird, every wild animal and reptile, and every human. Mountains will crumble, cliffs will fall, and cities will collapse."
Ezekiel,38,21,"I, the LORD , will make the mountains of Israel turn against you. Your troops will be so terrified that they will attack each other."
Ezekiel,38,22,"I will strike you with diseases and punish you with death. You and your army will be pounded with rainstorms, hailstones, and burning sulphur."
Ezekiel,38,23,"I will do these things to show the world that I, the LORD , am holy."
Ezekiel,39,1,"Ezekiel, son of man, condemn Gog and tell him: You are the ruler of Meshech and Tubal, but I, the LORD , am your enemy!"
Ezekiel,39,2,I will turn you around and drag you from the north until you reach the mountains of Israel.
Ezekiel,39,3,"I will knock the bow out of your left hand and the arrows out of your right hand,"
Ezekiel,39,4,and you and your army will die on those mountains. Then birds and wild animals will eat the flesh
Ezekiel,39,5,"of your dead bodies left lying in open fields. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Ezekiel,39,6,"I will set fire to the land of Magog and to those nations along the coast that think they are so secure, and they will know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,39,7,"My people Israel will know me, and they will no longer disgrace my holy name. Everyone on earth will know that I am the holy LORD God of Israel."
Ezekiel,39,8,"The day is coming when these things will happen, just as I have promised."
Ezekiel,39,9,"When that day comes, the people in the towns of Israel will collect the weapons of their dead enemies. They will use these shields, bows and arrows, spears, and clubs as firewood, and there will be enough to last for seven years."
Ezekiel,39,10,"They will burn these weapons instead of gathering sticks or chopping down trees. That's how the Israelites will take revenge on those who robbed and abused them. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Ezekiel,39,11,"After Gog has been destroyed, I will bury him and his army in Israel, in Travellers' Valley, east of the Dead Sea. That graveyard will be so large that it will block the way of anyone who tries to walk through the valley, which will then be known as “The Valley of Gog's Army”."
Ezekiel,39,12,The Israelites will spend seven months burying dead bodies and cleaning up their land.
Ezekiel,39,13,"Everyone will help with the burial, and they will be honoured for this on the day the brightness of my glory is seen."
Ezekiel,39,14,"After those seven months, the people will appoint a group of men to look for any dead bodies left unburied. This must be done for seven months to make sure that the land is no longer unclean."
Ezekiel,39,15,"Whenever they find a human bone, they will set up a marker next to it. Then the gravediggers will bury it in “The Valley of Gog's Army”"
Ezekiel,39,16,"near the town of “Gog's Army”. After that, the land will be pure again."
Ezekiel,39,17,"Ezekiel, son of man, I am going to hold a feast on Israel's mountains and offer sacrifices there. So invite all the birds and wild animals to come from every direction and eat the meat of sacrifices and drink the blood. The birds and animals"
Ezekiel,39,18,"will feast on the bodies of warriors and foreign rulers that I will sacrifice like sheep, goats, and bulls."
Ezekiel,39,19,I want the birds and animals to eat until they are full and drink until they are drunk.
Ezekiel,39,20,"They will come to my table and stuff themselves with the flesh of horses and warriors of every kind. I, the LORD God, have spoken."
Ezekiel,39,21,"When I punish the nations of the earth, they will see the brightness of my glory."
Ezekiel,39,22,The people of Israel will know from then on that I am the LORD their God.
Ezekiel,39,23,Foreign nations will realize that the Israelites were forced to leave their own land because they sinned against me. I turned my back on my people and let enemies attack and kill them.
Ezekiel,39,24,"Their lives were wicked and corrupt, and they deserved to be punished."
Ezekiel,39,25,"Now I will show mercy to the people of Israel and bring them back from the nations where they are living. They are Jacob's descendants, so I will bless them and show that I am holy."
Ezekiel,39,26,"They will live safely in their own land, but will be ashamed when they remember their evil ways and how they disgraced me."
Ezekiel,39,27,"Foreign nations will watch as I take the Israelites from enemy lands and bring them back home, and those nations will see that I am holy."
Ezekiel,39,28,"My people will realize that I, the LORD their God, sent them away as prisoners and now will bring them back to their own land."
Ezekiel,39,29,"Never again will I turn my back on the people of Israel, and my Spirit will live in them. I, the LORD , have spoken."
Ezekiel,41,1,"Next we went into the main room of the temple. The man measured the doorway of this room: it was three metres wide,"
Ezekiel,41,2,"five metres long, and the distance from the doorway to the wall on either side was two and a half metres. The main room itself was twenty metres by ten metres."
Ezekiel,43,1,"The man took me back to the east gate of the temple,"
Ezekiel,43,2,"where I saw the brightness of the glory of Israel's God coming from the east. The sound I heard was as loud as ocean waves, and everything around was shining with the dazzling brightness of his glory."
Ezekiel,43,3,"This vision was like the one I had seen when God came to destroy Jerusalem and like the one I had seen near the River Chebar. I immediately bowed with my face to the ground,"
Ezekiel,43,4,and the LORD 's glory came through the east gate and into the temple.
Ezekiel,43,5,"The LORD 's Spirit lifted me to my feet and carried me to the inner courtyard, where I saw that the LORD 's glory had filled the temple."
Ezekiel,43,6,"The man was standing beside me, and I heard the LORD say from inside the temple:"
Ezekiel,43,7,"Ezekiel, son of man, this temple is my throne on earth. I will live here among the people of Israel for ever. They and their kings will never again disgrace me by worshipping idols at local shrines or by setting up memorials to their dead kings."
Ezekiel,43,8,"Israel's kings built their palaces so close to my holy temple that only a wall separated them from me. Then these kings disgraced me with their evil ways, and in my fierce anger I destroyed them."
Ezekiel,43,9,"But if the people and their kings stop worshipping other gods and tear down those memorials, I will live among them for ever."
Ezekiel,43,10,"The people of Israel must suffer shame for sinning against me, so tell them about my holy temple. Let them think about it,"
Ezekiel,43,11,"then if they are truly sorry, describe for them the design and shape of the temple, the gates, the measurements, and how the buildings are arranged. Explain the regulations about worshipping there, then write down these things, so they can study and obey them."
Ezekiel,43,12,The temple area on my holy mountain must be kept sacred! This is the most important law about the temple.
Ezekiel,43,13,"According to the official standards, the altar in the temple had the following measurements: around the bottom of the altar was a gutter fifty centimetres wide and fifty centimetres deep, with a twenty-five-centimetre ledge on the outer rim."
Ezekiel,44,1,"The man took me back to the outer courtyard, near the east gate of the temple area. I saw that the doors to this gate were closed."
Ezekiel,44,2,"The LORD said: I, the LORD God of Israel, came through this gate, so it must remain closed for ever! No one must ever use it."
Ezekiel,44,3,"The ruler of Israel may come here to eat a sacrificial meal that has been offered to me, but he must use only the entrance room of this gate."
Ezekiel,44,4,"Then the man took me through the north gate to the front of the temple. I saw that the brightness of the LORD 's glory had filled the temple, and I immediately bowed with my face to the ground."
Ezekiel,44,5,"The LORD said: Ezekiel, son of man, I am going to give you the laws for my temple. So pay attention and listen carefully to what kind of people are allowed to come in the temple, and what kind are not."
Ezekiel,44,6,"Tell those rebellious people of Israel: I, the LORD God, command you to stop your evil ways!"
Ezekiel,44,7,"My temple has been disgraced, because you have let godless, stubborn foreigners come here when sacrifices are being offered to me. You have sinned and have broken our solemn agreement."
Ezekiel,44,8,"Instead of following the proper ways to worship me, you have put foreigners in charge of worship at my temple."
Ezekiel,44,9,"And so I, the LORD God, say that no godless foreigner who disobeys me will be allowed in my temple. This includes any foreigner living in Israel."
Ezekiel,44,10,Some of the Levites turned their backs on me and joined the other people of Israel in worshipping idols. So these Levites must be punished!
Ezekiel,44,11,They will still be allowed to serve me as temple workers by guarding the gates and by killing the animals to be sacrificed and by helping the worshippers.
Ezekiel,44,12,"But because these Levites served the people of Israel when they worshipped idols, I, the LORD God, promise that the Levites will be punished. They did not stop the Israelites from sinning,"
Ezekiel,44,13,and now I will no longer let the Levites serve as my priests or come near anything sacred to me. They must suffer shame and disgrace for their disgusting sins.
Ezekiel,44,14,They will be responsible for all the hard work that must be done in the temple.
Ezekiel,44,15,"The priests of the Levi tribe who are descendants of Zadok the priest were faithful to me, even when the rest of the Israelites turned away. And so, these priests will continue to serve as my priests and to offer the fat and the blood of sacrifices."
Ezekiel,44,16,"They will come into my temple, where they will offer sacrifices at my altar and lead others in worship."
Ezekiel,44,17,"When they come to the inner courtyard, they must wear their linen priestly clothes. My priests must never wear anything made of wool when they are on duty in this courtyard or in the temple."
Ezekiel,44,18,Even their turbans and underwear must be made of linen to keep my priests from sweating when they work.
Ezekiel,44,19,"And before they leave to join the other people in the outer courtyard, they must take off their priestly clothes, then place them in the sacred rooms and put on their ordinary clothes. That way, no one will touch their sacred clothes and be harmed."
Ezekiel,44,20,Priests must never shave their heads when they are mourning. But they must keep their hair properly trimmed and not let it grow too long.
Ezekiel,44,21,They must not drink wine before going to the inner courtyard.
Ezekiel,44,22,A priest must not marry a divorced woman; he can marry only a virgin from Israel or the widow of another priest.
Ezekiel,44,23,"Priests must teach my people the difference between what is sacred and what is ordinary, and between what is clean and what is unclean."
Ezekiel,44,24,"They will make decisions in difficult legal cases, according to my own laws. They must also observe the religious festivals my Law requires and must always respect the Sabbath."
Ezekiel,44,25,"Touching a dead body will make a person unclean. So a priest must not go near a dead body, unless it is one of his parents or children, or his brother or unmarried sister."
Ezekiel,44,26,"If a priest touches a dead body, he is unclean and must go through a ceremony to make himself clean. Then seven days later,"
Ezekiel,44,27,"he must go to the inner courtyard of the temple and offer a sacrifice for sin. After that, he may once again serve as my priest. I, the LORD God, have spoken."
Ezekiel,44,28,"I myself will provide for my priests, and so they won't receive any land of their own."
Ezekiel,44,29,"Instead, they will receive part of the grain sacrifices, as well as part of the sacrifices for sin and sacrifices to make things right. They will also be given everything in Israel that has been completely dedicated to me."
Ezekiel,44,30,"The first part of every harvest will belong to the priests. They will also receive part of all special gifts and offerings the Israelites bring to me. And whenever any of my people bake bread, they will give their first loaf as an offering to the priests, and I will bless the homes of the people when they do this."
Ezekiel,44,31,Priests must not eat any bird or animal that dies a natural death or that has been killed by a wild animal.
Ezekiel,45,1,"When the land of Israel is divided among the twelve tribes, you must set aside an area that will belong to me. This sacred area will be twelve and a half kilometres long and ten kilometres wide."
Ezekiel,45,2,"The temple will be on a piece of land two hundred and fifty-five metres square, and the temple will be completely surrounded by an open space twenty-five metres wide."
Ezekiel,46,1,"The LORD said: The east gate of the inner courtyard must remain closed during the six working days of each week. But on the Sabbath and on the first day of the month, this gate will be opened."
Ezekiel,46,2,"Israel's ruler will go from the outer courtyard into the entrance room of this gate and stand in the doorway while the priest offers sacrifices to ask my blessing and sacrifices to please me. The ruler will bow with his face to the ground to show that he has worshipped me. Then he will leave, and the gate will remain open until evening."
Ezekiel,46,3,"Each Sabbath and on the first day of each month, the people of Israel must also come to the east gate and worship me."
Ezekiel,46,4,"On the Sabbath, the ruler will bring six lambs and one ram to be offered as sacrifices to please me. There must be nothing wrong with any of these animals."
Ezekiel,46,5,"With the ram, he is to offer nine kilogrammes of grain, and with each of the lambs, he can offer as much as he wants. He must also offer three litres of olive oil with every nine kilogrammes of grain."
Ezekiel,46,6,"The ruler is to bring six lambs, a bull, and a ram to be offered as sacrifices at the New Moon Festival. There must be nothing wrong with any of these animals."
Ezekiel,46,7,"With the bull and the ram, he is to offer nine kilogrammes of grain, and with each of the lambs, he can offer as much as he wants. He must also offer three litres of olive oil with every nine kilogrammes of grain."
Ezekiel,46,8,The ruler must come through the entrance room of the east gate and leave the same way.
Ezekiel,46,9,"When my people come to worship me during any festival, they must always leave by the opposite gate from which they came: those who come in the north gate must leave by the south gate, and those who come in the south gate must leave by the north gate."
Ezekiel,46,10,Their ruler will come in at the same time they do and leave at the same time they leave.
Ezekiel,46,11,"At all other festivals and celebrations, nine kilogrammes of grain will be offered with a bull, and nine kilogrammes will be offered with a ram. The worshippers can offer as much grain as they want with each lamb. Three litres of olive oil must be offered with every nine kilogrammes of grain."
Ezekiel,46,12,"If the ruler voluntarily offers a sacrifice to please me or to ask my blessing, the east gate of the inner courtyard will be opened for him. He will offer his sacrifices just as he does on each Sabbath; then he will leave, and the gate will be closed."
Ezekiel,46,13,Each morning a year-old lamb that has nothing wrong with it must be offered as a sacrifice to please me.
Ezekiel,46,14,"Along with it, two kilogrammes of fine flour mixed with a litre of olive oil must be offered as a grain sacrifice. This law will never change—"
Ezekiel,46,15,"the lamb, the flour, and the olive oil will be offered to me every morning for all time."
Ezekiel,46,16,"The LORD God said: If the ruler of Israel gives some of his land to one of his children, it will belong to the ruler's child as part of the family property."
Ezekiel,46,17,"But if the ruler gives some of his land to one of his servants, the land will belong to the servant until the Year of Celebration, when it will be returned to the ruler. Only the ruler's children can keep what is given to them."
Ezekiel,46,18,The ruler must never abuse my people by taking land from them. Any land he gives his children must already belong to him.
Ezekiel,46,19,The man who was showing me the temple then took me back to the inner courtyard. We walked to the south side of the courtyard and stopped at the door to the sacred rooms that belonged to the priests. He showed me more rooms at the western edge of the courtyard
Ezekiel,46,20,"and said, “These are the kitchens where the priests must boil the meat to be offered as sacrifices to make things right and as sacrifices for sin. They will also bake the grain for sacrifices in these kitchens. That way, these sacred offerings won't have to be carried through the outer courtyard, where someone could accidentally touch them and be harmed.”"
Ezekiel,46,21,We went back to the outer courtyard and walked past the four corners.
Ezekiel,46,22,"At each corner I saw a smaller courtyard, twenty metres long and fifteen metres wide."
Ezekiel,46,23,"Around the inside of these smaller courtyards was a low wall of stones, and against the wall were places to build fires."
Ezekiel,46,24,"The man said, “These are the kitchens where the temple workers will boil the meat that worshippers offer as sacrifices.”"
Ezekiel,47,1,"The man took me back to the temple, where I saw a stream flowing from under the entrance. It began in the south part of the temple, where it ran past the altar and continued east through the courtyard."
Ezekiel,47,2,We walked out of the temple area through the north gate and went around to the east gate. I saw the small stream of water flowing east from the south side of the gate.
Ezekiel,47,3,"The man walked east, then took out his measuring stick and measured five hundred metres downstream. He told me to wade through the stream there, and the water came up to my ankles."
Ezekiel,47,4,"Then he measured another five hundred metres downstream, and told me to wade through it there. The water came up to my knees. Another five hundred metres downstream the water came up to my waist."
Ezekiel,47,5,"Another five hundred metres downstream, the stream had become a river that could be crossed only by swimming."
Ezekiel,47,6,"The man said, “Ezekiel, son of man, pay attention to what you've seen.” We walked to the river bank,"
Ezekiel,47,7,where I saw dozens of trees on each side.
Ezekiel,47,8,"The man said: This water flows eastwards to the valley of the River Jordan and empties into the Dead Sea, where it turns the salt water into fresh water."
Ezekiel,47,9,"Wherever this water flows, there will be all kinds of animals and fish, because it will bring life and fresh water to the Dead Sea."
Ezekiel,47,10,"From En-Gedi to Eneglaim, people will fish in the sea and dry their nets along the coast. There will be as many kinds of fish in the Dead Sea as there are in the Mediterranean Sea."
Ezekiel,47,11,"But the marshes along the shore will remain salty, so that people can use the salt from them."
Ezekiel,47,12,"Fruit trees will grow all along this river and produce fresh fruit every month. The leaves will never dry out, because they will always have water from the stream that flows from the temple, and they will be used for healing people."
Daniel,1,1,"In the third year that Jehoiakim was king of Judah, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia attacked Jerusalem."
Daniel,1,2,"The Lord let Nebuchadnezzar capture Jehoiakim and take away some of the things used in God's temple. And when the king returned to Babylonia, he put these things in the temple of his own god."
Daniel,1,3,"One day the king ordered Ashpenaz, his highest palace official, to choose some young men from the royal family of Judah and from other leading Jewish families."
Daniel,1,4,"The king said, “They must be healthy, handsome, clever, wise, educated, and fit to serve in the royal palace. Teach them how to speak and write our language"
Daniel,1,5,"and give them the same food and wine that I am served. Train them for three years, and then they can become court officials.”"
Daniel,1,6,"Four of the young Jews chosen were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, all from the tribe of Judah."
Daniel,1,7,"But the king's chief official gave them Babylonian names: Daniel became Belteshazzar, Hananiah became Shadrach, Mishael became Meshach, and Azariah became Abednego."
Daniel,1,8,Daniel made up his mind to eat and drink only what God had approved for his people to eat. And he asked the king's chief official for permission not to eat the food and wine served in the royal palace.
Daniel,1,9,God had made the official friendly and kind to Daniel.
Daniel,1,10,"But the man still told him, “The king has decided what you must eat and drink. And I am afraid he will kill me, if you eat something else and end up looking worse than the other young men.”"
Daniel,1,11,"The king's official had put a guard in charge of Daniel and his three friends. So Daniel said to the guard,"
Daniel,1,12,"“For the next ten days, let us have only vegetables and water at mealtimes."
Daniel,1,13,"When the ten days are up, compare how we look with the other young men, and decide what to do with us.”"
Daniel,1,14,The guard agreed to do what Daniel had asked.
Daniel,1,15,"Ten days later, Daniel and his friends looked healthier and better than the young men who had been served food from the royal palace."
Daniel,1,16,"After this, the guard let them eat vegetables instead of the rich food and wine."
Daniel,1,17,God made the four young men clever and wise. They read a lot of books and became well educated. Daniel could also tell the meaning of dreams and visions.
Daniel,1,18,"At the end of the three year period set by King Nebuchadnezzar, his chief palace official brought all the young men to him."
Daniel,1,19,"The king interviewed them and discovered that none of the others were as outstanding as Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. So they were given positions in the royal court."
Daniel,1,20,"From then on, whenever the king asked for advice, he found their wisdom was ten times better than that of any of his other advisers and magicians."
Daniel,1,21,Daniel served there until the first year of King Cyrus.
Daniel,2,1,"During the second year that Nebuchadnezzar was king, he had such horrible nightmares that he could not sleep."
Daniel,2,2,"So he called in his counsellors, advisers, magicians, and wise men,"
Daniel,2,3,"and said, “I am disturbed by a dream that I don't understand, and I want you to explain it.”"
Daniel,2,4,"They answered in Aramaic, “Your Majesty, we hope you live for ever! We are your servants. Please tell us your dream, and we will explain what it means.”"
Daniel,2,5,"But the king replied, “No! I have made up my mind. If you don't tell me both the dream and its meaning, you will be chopped to pieces and your houses will be torn down."
Daniel,2,6,"However, if you do tell me both the dream and its meaning, you will be greatly rewarded and highly honoured. Now tell me the dream and explain what it means.”"
Daniel,2,7,"“Your Majesty,” they said, “if you will only tell us your dream, we will interpret it for you.”"
Daniel,2,8,"The king replied, “You're just stalling for time,"
Daniel,2,9,"because you know what's going to happen if you don't come up with the answer. You've decided to make up a pack of lies, hoping I might change my mind. Now tell me the dream, and that will prove that you can interpret it.”"
Daniel,2,10,"His advisers explained, “Your Majesty, you are demanding the impossible! No king, not even the most famous and powerful, has ever ordered his advisers, magicians, or wise men to do such a thing."
Daniel,2,11,"It can't be done, except by the gods, and they don't live here on earth.”"
Daniel,3,1,"King Nebuchadnezzar ordered a gold statue to be built twenty-seven metres high and nearly three metres wide. He had it set up in Dura Valley near the city of Babylon,"
Daniel,3,2,"and he commanded his governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, and his other officials to come from everywhere in his kingdom to the dedication of the statue."
Daniel,3,3,So all of them came and stood in front of it.
Daniel,3,4,"Then an official stood up and announced: People of every nation and race, now listen to the king's command!"
Daniel,3,5,"Trumpets, flutes, harps, and all other kinds of musical instruments will soon start playing. When you hear the music, you must bow down and worship the statue that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up."
Daniel,3,6,Anyone who refuses will at once be thrown into a flaming furnace.
Daniel,3,7,"As soon as the people heard the music, they bowed down and worshipped the gold statue that the king had set up."
Daniel,3,8,Some Babylonians used this as a chance to accuse the Jews to King Nebuchadnezzar.
Daniel,3,9,"They said, “Your Majesty, we hope you live for ever!"
Daniel,3,10,You commanded everyone to bow down and worship the gold statue when the music played.
Daniel,3,11,And you said that anyone who did not bow down and worship it would be thrown into a flaming furnace.
Daniel,3,12,"Sir, you appointed three men to high positions in Babylon Province, but they have disobeyed you. Those Jews, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, refuse to worship your gods and the statue you have set up.”"
Daniel,3,13,"King Nebuchadnezzar was furious. So he sent for the three young men and said,"
Daniel,3,14,“I hear that you refuse to worship my gods and the gold statue I have set up.
Daniel,3,15,"Now I am going to give you one more chance. If you bow down and worship the statue when you hear the music, everything will be all right. But if you don't, you will at once be thrown into a flaming furnace. No god can save you from me.”"
Daniel,3,16,"The three men replied, “Your Majesty, we don't need to defend ourselves."
Daniel,3,17,The God we worship can save us from you and your flaming furnace.
Daniel,3,18,"But even if he doesn't, we still won't worship your gods and the gold statue you have set up.”"
Daniel,3,19,Nebuchadnezzar's face twisted with anger at the three men. And he ordered the furnace to be heated seven times hotter than usual.
Daniel,3,20,"Next, he commanded some of his strongest soldiers to tie up the men and throw them into the flaming furnace."
Daniel,4,1,King Nebuchadnezzar sent the following letter to the people of all nations and races on the earth: Greetings to all of you!
Daniel,4,2,I am glad to tell about the wonderful miracles God Most High has done for me.
Daniel,4,3,"His miracles are mighty and marvellous. He will rule for ever, and his kingdom will never end."
Daniel,4,4,"I was enjoying a time of peace and prosperity,"
Daniel,4,5,when suddenly I had some horrifying dreams and visions.
Daniel,4,6,"Then I commanded every wise man in Babylonia to appear in my court, so they could explain the meaning of my dream."
Daniel,4,7,"After they arrived, I told them my dream, but they were not able to say what it meant."
Daniel,4,8,"Finally, a young man named Daniel came in, and I told him the dream. The holy gods had given him special powers, and I had renamed him Belteshazzar after my own god."
Daniel,4,9,"I said, “Belteshazzar, not only are you the wisest of all advisers and counsellors, but the holy gods have given you special powers to solve the most difficult mysteries. So listen to what I dreamed and tell me what it means:"
Daniel,4,10,In my sleep I saw a very tall tree in the centre of the world.
Daniel,4,11,"It grew stronger and higher, until it reached to heaven and could be seen from anywhere on earth."
Daniel,4,12,"It was covered with leaves and heavy with fruit— enough for all nations. Wild animals enjoyed its shade, birds nested in its branches, and all creatures on earth lived on its fruit."
Daniel,4,13,"“While I was in bed, having this vision, a holy angel came down from heaven"
Daniel,4,14,and shouted: ‘Chop down the tree and cut off its branches; strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Make the animals leave its shade and send the birds flying from its branches.
Daniel,4,15,"But leave its stump and roots in the ground, surrounded by grass and held by chains of iron and bronze. ‘Make sure that this ruler lives like the animals out in the open fields, unprotected from the dew."
Daniel,4,16,Give him the mind of a wild animal for seven long years.
Daniel,4,17,This punishment is given at the command of the holy angels. It will show to all who live that God Most High controls all kingdoms and chooses for their rulers persons of humble birth.’
Daniel,4,18,"“Daniel, that was the dream that none of the wise men in my kingdom were able to understand. But I am sure that you will understand what it means, because the holy gods have given you some special powers.”"
Daniel,4,19,"For a while, Daniel was terribly confused and worried by what he was thinking. But I said, “Don't be bothered either by the dream or by what it means.” Daniel replied: Your Majesty, I wish the dream had been against your enemies."
Daniel,4,20,You saw a tree that grew so big and strong that it reached up to heaven and could be seen from anywhere on earth.
Daniel,4,21,"Its leaves were beautiful, and it produced enough fruit for all living creatures; animals lived in its shade, and birds nested in its branches."
Daniel,4,22,"Your Majesty, that tree is you. Your glorious reputation has reached heaven, and your kingdom covers the earth."
Daniel,4,23,"Then you saw a holy angel come down from heaven and say, “Chop down the tree and destroy it! But leave its stump and roots in the ground, fastened there by a chain of iron and bronze. Let it stay for seven years out in the field with the wild animals, unprotected from the dew.”"
Daniel,4,24,"Your Majesty, God Most High has sent you this message, and it means"
Daniel,4,25,"that you will be forced to live with the wild animals, far away from humans. You will eat grass like a wild animal and live outdoors for seven years, until you learn that God Most High controls all earthly kingdoms and chooses their rulers."
Daniel,4,26,"But he gave orders not to disturb the stump and roots. This is to show that you will be king once again, after you learn that the God who rules from heaven is in control."
Daniel,4,27,"Your Majesty, please be willing to do what I say. Turn from your sins and start living right; have mercy on those who are ill-treated. Then all will go well with you for a long time."
Daniel,5,1,"One evening, King Belshazzar gave a great banquet for a thousand of his highest officials, and he drank wine with them."
Daniel,5,2,"He got drunk and ordered his servants to bring in the gold and silver cups his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem. Belshazzar wanted the cups, so that he and all his wives and officials could drink from them."
Daniel,6,1,Darius divided his kingdom into a hundred and twenty states and placed a governor in charge of each one.
Daniel,6,2,"In order to make sure that his government was run properly, Darius put three other officials in charge of the governors. One of these officials was Daniel."
Daniel,6,3,And he did his work so much better than the other governors and officials that the king decided to let him govern the whole kingdom.
Daniel,6,4,"The other men tried to find something wrong with the way Daniel did his work for the king. But they could not accuse him of anything wrong, because he was honest and faithful and did everything he was supposed to do."
Daniel,6,5,"Finally, they said to one another, “We will never be able to bring any charge against Daniel, unless it has to do with his religion.”"
Daniel,6,6,"They all went to the king and said: “Your Majesty, we hope you live for ever!"
Daniel,6,7,"All of your officials, leaders, advisers, and governors agree that you should make a law forbidding anyone to pray to any god or human except you for the next thirty days. Everyone who disobeys this law must be thrown into a pit of lions."
Daniel,6,8,"Order this to be written and then sign it, so it cannot be changed, just as no written law of the Medes and Persians can be changed.”"
Daniel,6,9,So King Darius made the law and had it written down.
Daniel,6,10,"Daniel heard about the law, but when he returned home, he went upstairs and prayed in front of the window that faced Jerusalem. In the same way that he had always done, he knelt down in prayer three times a day, giving thanks to God."
Daniel,6,11,The men who had spoken to the king watched Daniel and saw him praying to his God for help.
Daniel,6,12,"They went back to the king and said, “Didn't you make a law that forbids anyone to pray to any god or human except you for the next thirty days? And doesn't the law say that everyone who disobeys it will be thrown into a pit of lions?” “Yes, that's the law I made,” the king agreed. “And just like all written laws of the Medes and Persians, it cannot be changed.”"
Daniel,6,13,"The men then told the king, “That Jew named Daniel, who was brought here as a captive, refuses to obey you or the law that you ordered to be written. And he still prays to his god three times a day.”"
Daniel,6,14,"The king was really upset to hear about this, and for the rest of the day he tried to think how he could save Daniel."
Daniel,6,15,"At sunset the men returned and said, “Your Majesty, remember that no written law of the Medes and Persians can be changed, not even by the king.”"
Daniel,6,16,"So Darius ordered Daniel to be brought out and thrown into a pit of lions. But he said to Daniel, “You have been faithful to your God, and I pray that he will rescue you.”"
Daniel,6,17,"A stone was rolled over the pit, and it was sealed. Then Darius and his officials stamped the seal to show that no one should let Daniel out."
Daniel,6,18,"All night long the king could not sleep. He did not eat anything, and he would not let anyone come in to entertain him."
Daniel,6,19,At daybreak the king got up and ran to the pit.
Daniel,6,20,"He was anxious and shouted, “Daniel, you were faithful and served your God. Was he able to save you from the lions?”"
Daniel,6,21,"Daniel answered, “Your Majesty, I hope you live for ever!"
Daniel,6,22,"My God knew that I was innocent, and he sent an angel to keep the lions from eating me. Your Majesty, I have never done anything to hurt you.”"
Daniel,6,23,"The king was relieved to hear Daniel's voice, and he gave orders for him to be taken out of the pit. Daniel's faith in his God had kept him from being harmed."
Daniel,6,24,"And the king ordered the men who had brought charges against Daniel to be thrown into the pit, together with their wives and children. But before they even reached the bottom, the lions ripped them to pieces."
Daniel,6,25,King Darius then sent this message to all people of every nation and race in the world: “Greetings to all of you!
Daniel,6,26,"I command everyone in my kingdom to worship and honour the God of Daniel. He is the living God, the one who lives for ever. His power and his kingdom will never end."
Daniel,6,27,He rescues people and sets them free by working great miracles. Daniel's God has rescued him from the power of the lions.”
Daniel,6,28,"All went well for Daniel while Darius was king, and even when Cyrus the Persian ruled."
Daniel,8,1,"Daniel wrote: In the third year of King Belshazzar of Babylonia, I had a second vision"
Daniel,8,2,"in which I was in Susa, the chief city of Babylonia's Elam Province. I was beside the River Ulai,"
Daniel,8,3,"when I looked up and saw a ram standing there with two horns on its head—both of them were long, but the second one was longer than the first."
Daniel,8,4,"The ram went charging towards the west, the north, and the south. No other animals were strong enough to oppose him, and nothing could save them from his power. So he did as he pleased and became even more powerful."
Daniel,8,5,"I kept on watching and saw a goat come from the west and charge across the entire earth, without even touching the ground. Between his eyes was a powerful horn,"
Daniel,8,6,and with tremendous anger the goat started towards the ram that I had seen beside the river.
Daniel,8,7,"The goat was so fierce that its attack broke both horns of the ram, leaving him powerless. Then the goat trampled on the ram, and no one could do anything to help."
Daniel,8,8,"After this, the goat became even more powerful. But at the peak of his power, his mighty horn was broken, and four other mighty horns took its place—one pointing to the north and one to the east, one to the south and one to the west."
Daniel,8,9,"A little horn came from one of these, and its power reached to the south, the east, and even to the holy land."
Daniel,8,10,"It became so strong that it attacked the stars in the sky, which were heaven's army. Then it threw some of them down to the earth and trampled on them."
Daniel,10,1,"In the third year of Cyrus the king of Persia, a message came to Daniel from God, and it was explained in a vision. The message was about a horrible war, and it was true."
Daniel,10,2,Daniel wrote: For three weeks I was in sorrow.
Daniel,10,3,"I ate no fine food or meat, I drank no wine, and I put no olive oil on my face or hair."
Daniel,10,4,"Then, on the twenty-fourth day of the first month, I was standing on the banks of the great River Tigris,"
Daniel,10,5,when I looked up and saw someone dressed in linen and wearing a solid gold belt.
Daniel,10,6,"His body was like a precious stone, his face like lightning, his eyes like flaming fires, his arms and legs like polished bronze, and his voice like the roar of a crowd."
Daniel,10,7,"Although the people who were with me did not see the vision, they became so frightened that they scattered and hid."
Daniel,10,8,"Only I saw this great vision. I became weak and pale,"
Daniel,10,9,"and at the sound of his voice, I fell face down in a deep sleep."
Daniel,10,10,He raised me to my hands and knees
Daniel,10,11,"and then said, “Daniel, your God thinks highly of you, and he has sent me. So stand up and pay close attention.” I stood trembling, while the angel said:"
Daniel,10,12,"Daniel, don't be afraid! God has listened to your prayers since the first day you humbly asked for understanding, and he has sent me here."
Daniel,10,13,"But the guardian angel of Persia opposed me for twenty-one days. Then Michael, who is one of the strongest guardian angels, came to rescue me from the kings of Persia."
Daniel,10,14,Now I have come here to give you another vision about what will happen to your people in the future.
Daniel,10,15,"While this angel was speaking to me, I stared at the ground, speechless."
Daniel,10,16,"Then he appeared in human form and touched my lips. I said, “Sir, this vision has brought me great pain and has drained my strength."
Daniel,10,17,"I am merely your servant. How can I possibly speak with someone so powerful, when I am almost too weak to get my breath?”"
Daniel,11,1,You also need to know that I protected and helped Darius the Mede in his first year as king.
Daniel,11,2,"What I am going to tell you is certain to happen. Four kings will rule Persia, one after the other, but the fourth one will become much richer than the others. In fact, his wealth will make him so powerful that he will turn everyone against the kingdom of Greece."
Daniel,11,3,Then a mighty king will come to power and will be able to do whatever he pleases.
Daniel,11,4,"But suddenly his kingdom will be crushed and scattered to the four corners of the earth, where four more kingdoms will rise. But these won't be ruled by his descendants or be as powerful as his kingdom."
Daniel,11,5,The king of the south will grow powerful. Then one of his generals will rebel and take over most of the kingdom.
Daniel,11,6,"Years later the southern kingdom and the northern kingdom will make a treaty, and the daughter of the king of the south will marry the king of the north. But she will lose her power. Then she, her husband, their child, and the servants who came with her will all be killed. After this,"
Daniel,11,7,one of her relatives will become the ruler of the southern kingdom. He will attack the army of the northern kingdom and capture its fortresses.
Daniel,11,8,"Then he will carry their idols to Egypt, together with their precious treasures of silver and gold, but it will be a long time before he attacks the northern kingdom again. Some years later"
Daniel,11,9,"the king of the north will invade the southern kingdom, but he will be forced back to his own country."
Daniel,11,10,"The sons of the king of the north will gather a huge army that will sweep down like a roaring flood, reaching all the way to the fortress of the southern kingdom."
Daniel,11,11,"But this will make the king of the south angry, and he will defeat this large army from the north."
Daniel,11,12,"The king of the south will feel proud because of the many thousands he has killed. But his victories won't last long,"
Daniel,11,13,"because the king of the north will gather a larger and more powerful army than ever before. Then in a few years, he will start invading other countries."
Daniel,11,14,"At this time many of your own people will try to make this vision come true by rebelling against the king of the south, but their rebellion will fail."
Daniel,11,15,"Then the army from the north will surround and capture a fortress in the south, and not even the most experienced troops of the southern kingdom will be able to make them retreat."
Daniel,11,16,"The king who invaded from the north will do as he pleases, and he will even capture and destroy the holy land."
Daniel,11,17,"In fact, he will decide to invade the south with his entire army. Then he will attempt to make peace by giving the king of the south a bride from the northern kingdom, but this won't be successful."
Daniel,11,18,"Afterwards, this proud king of the north will invade and conquer many of the nations along the coast, but a military leader will defeat him and make him lose his pride."
Daniel,11,19,"He will retreat to his fortresses in his own country, but on the way he will be defeated and never again be seen."
Daniel,11,20,"The next king of the north will try to collect taxes for the glory of his kingdom. However, he will come to a sudden end in some mysterious way, instead of in battle or because of someone's anger."
Daniel,11,21,"The successor of this king of the north will be a worthless nobody, who doesn't come from a royal family. He will suddenly appear and gain control of the kingdom by treachery."
Daniel,11,22,Then he will destroy armies and remove God's chosen high priest.
Daniel,11,23,"He will make a treaty, but he will be deceitful and break it, even though he has only a few followers."
Daniel,11,24,"Without warning, he will successfully invade a wealthy province, which is something his ancestors never did. Then he will divide among his followers all of its treasures and property. But none of this will last very long."
Daniel,11,25,"He will gather a large and powerful army, and with great courage he will attack the king of the south. The king of the south will meet him with a much stronger army, but he will lose the battle, because he will be betrayed"
Daniel,11,26,"by members of the royal court. He will be ruined, and most of his army will be slaughtered."
Daniel,11,27,"The two kings will meet around a table and tell evil lies to each other. But their plans will fail, because God has already decided what will happen."
Daniel,11,28,"Then the king of the north will return to his country with great treasures. But on the way, he will attack the religion of God's people and do whatever else he pleases."
Daniel,11,29,"At the time God has decided, the king of the north will invade the southern kingdom again, but this time, things will be different."
Daniel,11,30,"Ships from the west will come to attack him, and he will be discouraged. Then he will start back to his own country and take out his anger on the religion of God's faithful people, while showing kindness to those who are unfaithful."
Daniel,11,31,"He will send troops to pollute the temple and the fortress, and he will stop the daily sacrifices. Then he will set up that “Horrible Thing” that causes destruction."
Daniel,11,32,"The king will use deceit to win followers from those who are unfaithful to God, but those who remain faithful will do everything possible to oppose him."
Daniel,11,33,"Wise leaders will instruct many of the people. But for a while, some of these leaders will either be killed with swords or burnt alive, or else robbed of their possessions and thrown into prison."
Daniel,11,34,"They will receive only a little help in their time of trouble, and many of their followers will be treacherous."
Daniel,11,35,"Some of those who are wise will suffer, so that God will make them pure and acceptable until the end, which will still come at the time he has decided."
Daniel,11,36,"This king will do as he pleases. He will proudly claim to be greater than any god and will insult the only true God. Indeed, he will be successful until God is no longer angry with his people."
Daniel,11,37,"This king will reject the gods his ancestors worshipped and the god preferred by women. In fact, he will put himself above all gods"
Daniel,11,38,"and worship only the so called god of fortresses, who was unknown to his ancestors. And he will honour it with gold, silver, precious stones, and other costly gifts."
Daniel,11,39,"With the help of this foreign god, he will capture the strongest fortresses. Everyone who worships this god will be put in a position of power and rewarded with wealth and land."
Daniel,11,40,"At the time of the end, the king of the south will attack the kingdom of the north. But its king will rush out like a storm with war chariots, cavalry, and many ships. Indeed, his forces will flood one country after another,"
Daniel,11,41,"and when they reach the holy land, tens of thousands will be killed. But the countries of Edom and Moab and the ruler of Ammon will escape."
Daniel,11,42,"The king of the north will invade many countries, including Egypt,"
Daniel,11,43,and he will take its rich treasures of gold and silver. He will also conquer Libya and Ethiopia.
Daniel,11,44,"But he will be alarmed by news from the east and the north, and he will become furious and cause great destruction."
Daniel,11,45,"After this, he will set up camp between the Mediterranean Sea and Mount Zion. Then he will be destroyed, and no one will be able to save him."
Daniel,12,1,"Michael, the chief of the angels, is the protector of your people, and he will come at a time of terrible suffering, the worst in all of history. And your people who have their names written in The Book will be protected."
Daniel,12,2,"Many of those who lie dead in the ground will rise from death. Some of them will be given eternal life, and others will receive nothing but eternal shame and disgrace."
Daniel,12,3,"Everyone who has been wise will shine as bright as the sky above, and everyone who has led others to please God will shine like the stars."
Daniel,12,4,"Daniel, I now command you to keep the message of this book secret until the end of time, even though many people will go everywhere, searching for the knowledge to be found in it."
Daniel,12,5,Daniel wrote: I looked around and saw two other people—one on this side of the river and one on the other side.
Daniel,12,6,"The angel who had spoken to me was dressed in linen and was standing upstream from them. So one of the two beside the river asked him, “How long before these amazing things happen?”"
Daniel,12,7,"The angel then raised both hands towards heaven and said, “In the name of the God who lives for ever, I solemnly promise that it will be a time, two times, and half a time. Everything will be over, when the suffering of God's holy people comes to an end.”"
Daniel,12,8,"I heard what the angel said, but I didn't understand. So I asked, “Sir, how will it all end?” The angel in my vision then replied:"
Daniel,12,9,"Daniel, go about your business, because the meaning of this message will remain secret until the end of time."
Daniel,12,10,"Many people will have their hearts and lives made pure and clean, but those who are evil will keep on being evil and never understand. Only the wise will understand."
Daniel,12,11,"There will be one thousand two hundred and ninety days from the time that the daily sacrifices are stopped, until someone sets up the “Horrible Thing” that causes destruction."
Daniel,12,12,God will bless everyone who patiently waits until one thousand three hundred and thirty-five days have gone by.
Daniel,12,13,"So, Daniel, be faithful until the end! You will rest, and at the end of time, you will rise from death to receive your reward."
Hosea,1,1,"I am Hosea son of Beeri. When Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah were the kings of Judah, and when Jeroboam son of Jehoash was king of Israel, the LORD spoke this message to me."
Hosea,1,2,"The LORD said, “Hosea, Israel has betrayed me like an unfaithful wife. Marry such a woman and have children by her.”"
Hosea,1,3,"So I married Gomer the daughter of Diblaim, and we had a son."
Hosea,1,4,"Then the LORD said, “Hosea, name your son Jezreel, because I will soon punish the descendants of King Jehu of Israel for the murders he committed in Jezreel Valley. I will destroy his kingdom,"
Hosea,1,5,and in Jezreel Valley I will break the power of Israel.”
Hosea,1,6,"Later, Gomer had a daughter, and the LORD said, “Name her Lo-Ruhamah, because I will no longer have mercy and forgive Israel."
Hosea,1,7,"But I am the LORD God of Judah, and I will have mercy and save Judah by my own power—not by wars and arrows or swords and cavalry.”"
Hosea,1,8,"After Gomer had stopped nursing Lo-Ruhamah, she had another son."
Hosea,1,9,"Then the LORD said, “Name him Lo-Ammi, because these people are not mine, and I am not their God.”"
Hosea,1,10,"Some day it will be impossible to count the people of Israel, because there will be as many of them as there are grains of sand along the seashore. They are now called “Not My People”, but in the future they will be called “Children of the Living God”."
Hosea,1,11,"Israel and Judah will unite and choose one leader. Then they will take back their land, and this will be a great day for Jezreel."
Hosea,2,1,So let your brothers be called “My People” and your sisters be called “Shown Mercy”.
Hosea,2,2,"Accuse! Accuse your mother! She is no longer my wife, and now I, the LORD, am not her husband. Beg her to give up prostitution and stop being unfaithful,"
Hosea,2,3,"or I will strip her naked like the day she was born. I will make her barren like a desert, and she will die of thirst."
Hosea,2,4,"You children are the result of her unfaithfulness, and I'll show you no pity."
Hosea,2,5,"Your mother was unfaithful. She was disgraceful and said, “I'll run after my lovers. Everything comes from them— my food and drink, my linen and wool, my olive oil and wine.”"
Hosea,2,6,"I, the LORD , will build a fence of thorns to block her path."
Hosea,2,7,"She will run after her lovers, but not catch them; she will search, but not find them. Then she will say, “I'll return to my first husband. Life was better then.”"
Hosea,2,8,"She didn't know that her grain, wine, and olive oil were gifts from me, as were the gold and silver she used in worshipping Baal."
Hosea,2,9,So I'll hold back the harvest of grain and grapes. I'll take back my wool and my linen that cover her body.
Hosea,2,10,Then I'll strip her naked in the sight of her lovers. No one can rescue her.
Hosea,2,11,"I'll stop Israel's celebrations— no more New Moon Festivals, Sabbaths, or other feasts."
Hosea,2,12,"She said, “My lovers gave me vineyards and fig trees as payment for sex.” Now I, the LORD , will ruin her vineyards and fig trees; they will become clumps of weeds eaten by wild animals."
Hosea,2,13,"I'll punish her for the days she worshipped Baal and burnt incense to him. I'll punish her for the times she forgot about me and wore jewellery and rings to attract her lovers. I, the LORD , have spoken!"
Hosea,2,14,"Israel, I, the LORD, will lure you into the desert and speak gently to you."
Hosea,2,15,"I will return your vineyards, and then Trouble Valley will become Hopeful Valley. You will say “Yes” to me as you did in your youth, when leaving Egypt."
Hosea,2,16,"I promise that from that day on, you will call me your husband instead of your master."
Hosea,2,17,I will no longer even let you mention the names of those pagan gods that you called “Master”.
Hosea,2,18,And I will agree to let you live in peace—you will no longer be attacked by wild animals and birds or by weapons of war.
Hosea,2,19,"I will accept you as my wife for ever, and instead of a bride price I will give you justice, fairness, love, kindness,"
Hosea,2,20,and faithfulness. Then you will truly know who I am.
Hosea,2,21,"I will command the sky to send rain on the earth,"
Hosea,2,22,"and it will produce grain, grapes, and olives in Jezreel Valley."
Hosea,2,23,"I will scatter the seeds and show mercy to Lo-Ruhamah. I will say to Lo-Ammi, “You are my people,” and they will answer, “You are our God.”"
Hosea,3,1,"Once again the LORD spoke to me. And this time he said, “Hosea, fall in love with an unfaithful woman who has a lover. Do this to show that I love the people of Israel, even though they worship idols and enjoy the offering cakes made with fruit.”"
Hosea,3,2,So I paid fifteen pieces of silver and about a hundred and fifty kilogrammes of grain for such a woman.
Hosea,3,3,"Then I said, “Now you are mine! You will have to remain faithful to me, though it will be a long time before we sleep together.”"
Hosea,3,4,It will also be a long time before Israel has a king or before sacrifices are offered at the temple or before there is any way to get guidance from God.
Hosea,3,5,"But later, Israel will turn back to the LORD their God and to David their king. At that time they will come to the LORD with fear and trembling, and he will be good to them."
Hosea,4,1,"Israel, listen as the LORD accuses everyone in the land! No one is faithful or loyal or truly cares about God."
Hosea,4,2,"Cursing, dishonesty, murder, robbery, unfaithfulness— these happen all the time. Violence is everywhere."
Hosea,4,3,"And so your land is a desert. Every living creature is dying— people and wild animals, birds and fish."
Hosea,4,4,"Don't accuse just anyone! Not everyone is at fault. My case is against you, the priests."
Hosea,4,5,You and the prophets will stumble day and night; I'll silence your mothers.
Hosea,4,6,"You priests have rejected me, and my people are destroyed by refusing to obey. Now I'll reject you and forget your children, because you have forgotten my Law."
Hosea,4,7,"By adding more of you priests, you multiply the number of people who sin. Now I'll change your pride into shame."
Hosea,4,8,"You encourage others to sin, so you can stuff yourselves on their sin offerings."
Hosea,4,9,"That's why I will punish the people for their deeds, just as I will punish you priests."
Hosea,4,10,"Their food won't satisfy, and having sex at pagan shrines won't produce children. My people have rebelled"
Hosea,4,11,"and have been unfaithful to me, their LORD. My people, you are foolish because of too much pleasure and too much wine."
Hosea,4,12,"You expect wooden idols and other objects of wood to give you advice. Lusting for sex at pagan shrines has made you unfaithful to me, your God."
Hosea,4,13,"You offer sacrifices on mountaintops and hills, under oak trees, and wherever good shade is found. Your own daughters and daughters-in-law sell themselves for sex."
Hosea,4,14,"But I won't punish them. You men are to blame, because you go to prostitutes and offer sacrifices with them at pagan shrines. Your own foolishness will lead to your ruin."
Hosea,4,15,"Israel, you are unfaithful, but don't lead Judah to sin. Stop worshipping at Gilgal or at sinful Bethel. And stop making promises in my name— the name of the living LORD."
Hosea,4,16,"You are nothing more than a stubborn cow— so stubborn that I, the LORD, cannot feed you like lambs in an open pasture."
Hosea,4,17,You people of Israel are charmed by idols. Leave them alone!
Hosea,4,18,"You get drunk, then sleep with prostitutes; you would rather be vulgar than lead a decent life."
Hosea,4,19,And so you will be swept away in a whirlwind for sacrificing to idols.
Hosea,5,1,"Listen, you priests! Pay attention, Israel! Listen, you members of the royal family. Justice was your duty. But at Mizpah and Mount Tabor you trapped the people."
Hosea,5,2,"At the place of worship you were a treacherous pit, and I will punish you."
Hosea,5,3,"Israel, I know-all about you, and because of your unfaithfulness, I find you unacceptable."
Hosea,5,4,"Your evil deeds are the reason you won't return to me, your LORD God. And your constant craving for sex keeps you from knowing me."
Hosea,5,5,"Israel, your pride testifies to your guilt; it makes you stumble, and Judah stumbles too."
Hosea,5,6,"You offer sheep and cattle as sacrifices to me, but I have turned away and refuse to be found."
Hosea,5,7,"You have been unfaithful to me, your LORD; you have had children by prostitutes. So at the New Moon Festival, you and your crops will be destroyed."
Hosea,5,8,"Give a warning on the trumpet! Let it be heard in Gibeah, Ramah, and sinful Bethel. Benjamin, watch out!"
Hosea,5,9,"I, the LORD , will punish and wipe out Israel. This is my solemn promise to every tribe of Israel."
Hosea,5,10,Judah's leaders are like crooks who move boundary markers; that's why I will flood them with my anger.
Hosea,5,11,Israel was brutally crushed. They got what they deserved for worshipping useless idols.
Hosea,5,12,"Now I, the LORD, will fill Israel with maggots and make Judah rot."
Hosea,5,13,"When Israel and Judah saw their sickness and wounds, Israel asked help from Assyria and its mighty king. But the king cannot cure them or heal their wounds."
Hosea,5,14,"So I'll become a fierce lion attacking Israel and Judah. I'll snatch and carry off what I want, and no one can stop me."
Hosea,5,15,"Then I'll return to my temple until they confess their guilt and worship me, until they are desperate and beg for my help."
Hosea,6,1,"Let's return to the LORD. He has torn us to shreds, but he will bandage our wounds and make us well."
Hosea,6,2,In two or three days he will heal us and restore our strength that we may live with him.
Hosea,6,3,Let's do our best to know the LORD. His coming is as certain as the morning sun; he will refresh us like rain renewing the earth in the springtime.
Hosea,6,4,"People of Israel and Judah, what can I do with you? Your love for me disappears more quickly than mist or dew at sunrise."
Hosea,6,5,That's why I slaughtered you with the words of my prophets. That's why my judgments blazed like the dawning sun.
Hosea,6,6,I'd rather you were faithful and knew me than offered sacrifices.
Hosea,6,7,"At a place named Adam, you betrayed me by breaking our agreement."
Hosea,6,8,Everyone in Gilead is evil; your hands are stained with the blood of victims.
Hosea,6,9,You priests are like a gang of robbers in ambush. On the road to Shechem you murder and commit other horrible crimes.
Hosea,6,10,I have seen a terrible thing in Israel— you are unfaithful and unfit to worship me.
Hosea,6,11,"People of Judah, your time is coming too. I, the LORD , would like to make my nation prosper again"
Hosea,7,1,and to heal its wounds. But then I see the crimes in Israel and Samaria. Everyone is deceitful; robbers roam the streets.
Hosea,7,2,No one realizes that I have seen their sins surround them like a flood.
Hosea,7,3,The king and his officials take great pleasure in their sin and deceit.
Hosea,7,4,"Everyone burns with desire— they are like coals in an oven, ready to burst into flames."
Hosea,7,5,"On the day their king was crowned, his officials got him drunk, and he joined in their foolishness."
Hosea,7,6,"Their anger is a fire that smoulders all night, then flares up at dawn."
Hosea,7,7,They are flames destroying their leaders. And their kings are powerless; none of them trust me.
Hosea,7,8,The people of Israel have mixed with foreigners; they are a thin piece of bread scorched on one side.
Hosea,7,9,"They don't seem to realize how weak and feeble they are; their hair has turned grey, while foreigners rule."
Hosea,7,10,"I am the LORD , their God, but in all their troubles their pride keeps them from returning to me."
Hosea,7,11,"Israel is a senseless bird, fluttering back and forth between Egypt and Assyria."
Hosea,7,12,"But I will catch them in a net as hunters trap birds; I threatened to punish them, and indeed I will."
Hosea,7,13,"Trouble and destruction will be their reward for rejecting me. I would have rescued them, but they told me lies."
Hosea,7,14,"They don't really pray to me; they just howl in their beds. They have rejected me for Baal and slashed themselves, in the hope that Baal will bless their crops."
Hosea,7,15,"I taught them what they know, and I made them strong. Now they plot against me"
Hosea,7,16,and refuse to obey. They are more useless than a crooked arrow. Their leaders will die in war for saying foolish things. Egyptians will laugh at them.
Hosea,8,1,"Sound a warning! Israel, you broke our agreement and ignored my teaching. Now an eagle is swooping down to attack my land."
Hosea,8,2,"Israel, you say, “We claim you, the LORD , as our God.”"
Hosea,8,3,But your enemies will chase you for rejecting our good agreement.
Hosea,8,4,You chose kings and leaders without consulting me; you made silver and gold idols that led to your downfall.
Hosea,8,5,"City of Samaria, I'm angry because of your idol in the shape of a calf. When will you ever be innocent again?"
Hosea,8,6,"Someone from Israel built that idol for you, but only I am God. And so it will be smashed to pieces."
Hosea,8,7,"If you scatter wind instead of wheat, you will harvest a whirlwind and have no wheat. Even if you harvest grain, enemies will steal it all."
Hosea,8,8,"Israel, you are ruined, and now the nations consider you worthless."
Hosea,8,9,You are like a wild donkey that goes its own way. You've run off to Assyria and hired them as allies.
Hosea,8,10,"You can bargain with nations, but I'll catch you anyway. Soon you will suffer abuse by kings and rulers."
Hosea,8,11,"Israel, you have built many altars where you offer sacrifices for sin. But these altars have become places for sin."
Hosea,8,12,"My instructions for sacrifices were written in detail, but you ignored them."
Hosea,8,13,"You sacrifice your best animals and eat the sacrificial meals, but I, the LORD, refuse your offerings. I will remember your sins and punish you. Then you will return to Egypt."
Hosea,8,14,"Israel, I created you, but you forgot me. You and Judah built palaces and many strong cities. Now I will send fire to destroy your towns and fortresses."
Hosea,9,1,"Israel, don't celebrate or make noisy shouts like other nations. You have been unfaithful to your God. Wherever grain is threshed, you behave like prostitutes because you enjoy the money you receive."
Hosea,9,2,"But you will run short of grain and wine,"
Hosea,9,3,and you will have to leave the land of the LORD. Some of you will go to Egypt; others will go to Assyria and eat unclean food.
Hosea,9,4,You won't be able to offer sacrifices of wine to the LORD. None of your sacrifices will please him— they will be unclean like food offered to the dead. Your food will only be used to satisfy your hunger; none of it will be brought to the LORD 's temple.
Hosea,9,5,You will no longer be able to celebrate the festival of the LORD.
Hosea,9,6,"Even if you escape alive, you will end up in Egypt and be buried in Memphis. Your silver treasures will be lost among weeds; thorns will sprout in your tents."
Hosea,9,7,"Israel, the time has come. You will get what you deserve, and you will know it. “Prophets are fools,” you say. “And God's messengers are mad.” Your terrible guilt has filled you with hatred."
Hosea,9,8,"Israel, the LORD sent me to look after you. But you trap his prophets and flood his temple with your hatred."
Hosea,9,9,"You are brutal and corrupt, as were the men of Gibeah. But God remembers your sin, and you will be punished."
Hosea,9,10,"Israel, when I, the LORD, found you long ago it was like finding grapes in a barren desert or tender young figs. Then you worshipped Baal-Peor, that disgusting idol, and you became as disgusting as the idol you loved."
Hosea,9,11,"And so, Israel, your glory will fly away like birds— your women will no longer be able to give birth."
Hosea,9,12,"Even if you do have children, I will take them all and leave you to mourn. I will turn away, and you will sink down in deep trouble."
Hosea,9,13,"Israel, when I first met you, I thought of you as palm trees growing in fertile ground. Now you lead your people out, only to be slaughtered."
Hosea,9,14,"Our LORD , do just one thing for your people— make their women unable to have children or to nurse their babies."
Hosea,9,15,"Israel, I first began to hate you because you did evil at Gilgal. Now I will chase you out of my house. No longer will I love you; your leaders betrayed me."
Hosea,9,16,"Israel, you are a vine with dried up roots and fruitless branches. Even if you had more children and loved them dearly, I would slaughter them all."
Hosea,9,17,"Israel, you disobeyed my God. Now he will force you to roam from nation to nation."
Hosea,10,1,"You were a healthy vine covered with grapes. But the more grapes you grew, the more altars you built; the better off you became, the better shrines you set up for pagan gods."
Hosea,10,2,"You are deceitful and disloyal. So you will pay for your sins, because the LORD will destroy your altars and images."
Hosea,10,3,"“We don't have a king,” you will say. “We don't fear the LORD. And what good are kings?”"
Hosea,10,4,"Israel, you break treaties and don't keep promises; you turn justice into poisonous weeds where healthy plants should grow."
Hosea,10,5,"All who live in Samaria tremble with concern for the idols at sinful Bethel. The idol there was the pride of the priests, but it has been put to shame; now everyone will cry."
Hosea,10,6,It will be taken to Assyria and given to the great king. Then Israel will be disgraced for worshipping that idol.
Hosea,10,7,"Like a twig in a stream, the king of Samaria will be swept away."
Hosea,10,8,The altars at sinful Bethel will be destroyed for causing Israel to sin; they will be overgrown with thorns and thistles. Then everyone will beg the mountains and hills to cover and protect them.
Hosea,10,9,"Israel, you have never stopped sinning since that time at Gibeah. That's why you will be attacked at Gibeah."
Hosea,10,10,"Your sins have doubled, and you are rebellious. Now I have decided to send nations to attack and put you in chains."
Hosea,10,11,Once you were obedient like a calf that loved to thresh grain. But I will put a harness on your powerful neck; you and Judah must plough and cultivate the ground.
Hosea,10,12,"Plough your fields, scatter seeds of justice, and harvest faithfulness. Worship me, the LORD, and I will send my saving power down like rain."
Hosea,10,13,"You have planted evil, harvested injustice, and eaten the fruit of your lies. You trusted your own strength and your powerful forces."
Hosea,10,14,"So war will break out, and your fortresses will be destroyed. Your enemies will do to you what Shalman did to the people of Beth-Arbel— mothers and their children will be beaten to death against rocks."
Hosea,10,15,"Bethel, this will be your fate because of your evil. Israel, at dawn your king will be killed."
Hosea,11,1,"When Israel was a child, I loved him, and I called my son out of Egypt."
Hosea,11,2,"But as the saying goes, “The more they were called, the more they rebelled.” They never stopped offering incense and sacrifices to the idols of Baal."
Hosea,11,3,I took Israel by the arm and taught them to walk. But they would not admit that I was the one who had healed them.
Hosea,11,4,"I led them with kindness and with love, not with ropes. I held them close to me; I bent down to feed them."
Hosea,11,5,But they trusted Egypt instead of returning to me; now Assyria will rule them.
Hosea,11,6,"War will visit their cities, and their plans will fail."
Hosea,11,7,"My people are determined to reject me for a god they think is stronger, but he can't help."
Hosea,11,8,"Israel, I can't let you go. I can't give you up. How could I possibly destroy you as I did the towns of Admah and Zeboiim? I just can't do it. My feelings for you are much too strong."
Hosea,11,9,"Israel, I won't lose my temper and destroy you again. I am the Holy God— not merely a human being, and I won't stay angry."
Hosea,11,10,"I, the LORD , will roar like a lion, and my children will return, trembling from the west."
Hosea,11,11,"They will come back, fluttering like birds from Egypt or like doves from Assyria. Then I will bring them back to their homes. I, the LORD , have spoken!"
Hosea,11,12,"Israel is deceitful to me, their loyal and holy God; they surround me with lies, and Judah worships other gods."
Hosea,12,1,All day long Israel chases wind from the desert; deceit and violence are found everywhere. Treaties are made with Assyria; olive oil is taken to Egypt.
Hosea,12,2,"The LORD also brings charges against the people of Judah, the descendants of Jacob. He will punish them for what they have done."
Hosea,12,3,"Even before Jacob was born, he cheated his brother, and when he grew up, he fought against God."
Hosea,12,4,"At Bethel, Jacob wrestled with an angel and won; then with tears in his eyes, he asked for a blessing, and God spoke to us there."
Hosea,12,5,"God's name is the LORD, the LORD God All-Powerful."
Hosea,12,6,"So return to your God. Patiently trust him, and show love and justice."
Hosea,12,7,"Israel, you enjoy cheating and taking advantage of others."
Hosea,12,8,"You say to yourself, “I'm rich! I earned it all on my own, without committing a sin.”"
Hosea,12,9,"Israel, I, the LORD, am still your God, just as I have been since the time you were in Egypt. Now I will force you to live in tents once again, as you did in the desert."
Hosea,12,10,"I spoke to the prophets— often I spoke in visions. And so, I will send my prophets with messages of doom."
Hosea,12,11,"Gilead is terribly sinful and will end up ruined. Bulls are sacrificed in Gilgal on altars made of stones, but those stones will be scattered in every field."
Hosea,12,12,Jacob escaped to Syria where he tended sheep to earn himself a wife.
Hosea,12,13,I sent the prophet Moses to lead Israel from Egypt and to keep them safe.
Hosea,12,14,"Israel, I will make you pay for your terrible sins and for insulting me."
Hosea,13,1,"When your leaders spoke, everyone in Israel trembled and showed great respect. But you sinned by worshipping Baal, and you were destroyed."
Hosea,13,2,"Now you continue to sin by designing and making idols of silver in the shape of calves. You are told to sacrifice to these idols — yes, even to kiss them."
Hosea,13,3,"And so, all of you will vanish like the mist or the dew of early morning, or husks of grain in the wind or smoke from a chimney."
Hosea,13,4,"I, the LORD , have been your God since the time you were in Egypt. I am the only God you know, the only one who can save."
Hosea,13,5,I took care of you in a thirsty desert.
Hosea,13,6,"I fed you till you were satisfied, then you became proud and forgot about me."
Hosea,13,7,"Now I will attack like a lion, ambush you like a leopard,"
Hosea,13,8,"and rip you apart like a bear robbed of her cubs. I will gnaw on your bones, as though I were a lion or some other wild animal."
Hosea,13,9,"Israel, you are done for. Don't expect help from me."
Hosea,13,10,You wanted a king and rulers. Where is your king now? What cities have rulers?
Hosea,13,11,"In my anger, I gave you a king; in my fury, I took him away."
Hosea,13,12,"Israel, your terrible sins are written down and stored away."
Hosea,13,13,You are like a senseless child who refuses to be born at the proper time.
Hosea,13,14,"Should I, the LORD , rescue you from death and the grave? No! I call death and the grave to strike you like a plague. I refuse to show mercy."
Hosea,13,15,"No matter how much you prosper more than the other tribes, I, the LORD , will wipe you out, just as a scorching desert wind dries up streams of water. I will take away your precious treasures."
Hosea,13,16,"Samaria will be punished for turning against me. It will be destroyed in war— children will be beaten against rocks, and pregnant women will be ripped open."
Hosea,14,1,"Israel, return! Come back to the LORD , your God. Sin has made you fall."
Hosea,14,2,"Return to the LORD and say, “Please forgive our sins. Accept our good sacrifices of praise instead of bulls."
Hosea,14,3,"Assyria can't save us, and chariots can't help. So we will no longer worship the idols we have made. Our LORD , you show mercy to orphans.”"
Hosea,14,4,"Israel, you have rejected me, but my anger is gone; I will heal you and love you without limit."
Hosea,14,5,I will be like the dew— then you will blossom like lilies and have roots like a tree.
Hosea,14,6,Your branches will spread with the beauty of an olive tree and with the aroma of Lebanon Forest.
Hosea,14,7,"You will rest in my shade, and your grain will grow. You will blossom like a vineyard and be famous as the wine from Lebanon."
Hosea,14,8,"Israel, give up your idols! I will answer your prayers and take care of you. I am that glorious tree, the source of your fruit."
Hosea,14,9,"If you are wise, you will know and understand what I mean. I am the LORD , and I lead you along the right path. If you obey me, we will walk together, but if you are wicked, you will stumble."
Joel,1,1,I am Joel the son of Pethuel. And this is the message the LORD gave to me.
Joel,1,2,"Listen, you leaders and everyone else in the land. Has anything like this ever happened before?"
Joel,1,3,Tell our children! Let it be told to our grandchildren and their children too.
Joel,1,4,"Swarm after swarm of locusts has attacked our crops, eating everything in sight."
Joel,1,5,"Sober up, you drunkards! Cry long and loud; your wine supply is gone."
Joel,1,6,A powerful nation with countless troops has invaded our land. They have the teeth and jaws of powerful lions.
Joel,1,7,Our grapevines and fig trees are stripped bare; only naked branches remain.
Joel,1,8,Grieve like a young woman mourning for the man she was to marry.
Joel,1,9,"Offerings of grain and wine are no longer brought to the LORD 's temple. His servants, the priests, are deep in sorrow."
Joel,1,10,"Barren fields mourn; grain, grapes, and olives are scorched and shrivelled."
Joel,1,11,Mourn for our farms and our vineyards! There's no wheat or barley growing in our fields.
Joel,1,12,"Grapevines have dried up and so has every tree— figs and pomegranates, date palms and apples. All happiness has faded away."
Joel,1,13,"Mourn, you priests who serve at the altar of my God. Spend your days and nights wearing sackcloth. Offerings of grain and wine are no longer brought to the LORD 's temple."
Joel,1,14,Tell the leaders and people to come together at the temple. Order them to go without eating and to pray sincerely.
Joel,1,15,We are in for trouble! Soon the LORD All-Powerful will bring disaster.
Joel,1,16,Our food is already gone; there's no more celebrating at the temple of our God.
Joel,1,17,"Seeds dry up in the ground; no harvest is possible. Our barns are in bad shape, with no grain to store in them."
Joel,1,18,"Our cattle wander aimlessly, moaning for lack of pasture, and sheep are suffering."
Joel,1,19,"I cry out to you, LORD. Grasslands and forests are eaten by the scorching heat."
Joel,1,20,"Wild animals have no water because of you; rivers and streams are dry, and pastures are parched."
Joel,2,1,"Sound the trumpet on Zion, the LORD 's sacred hill. Warn everyone to tremble! The judgment day of the LORD is coming soon."
Joel,2,2,It will be dark and gloomy with storm clouds overhead. Troops will cover the mountains like thunderclouds. No army this powerful has ever been gathered before or will ever be again.
Joel,2,3,"Fiery flames surround them; no one escapes. Before they invaded, the land was like Eden; now only a desert remains."
Joel,2,4,They look like horses and charge like cavalry.
Joel,2,5,"They roar over mountains like noisy chariots, or a mighty army ready for battle. They are a forest fire that feasts on straw."
Joel,2,6,The very sight of them is frightening.
Joel,2,7,They climb over walls like warriors; they march in columns and never turn aside.
Joel,2,8,"They charge straight ahead, without pushing each other; even arrows and spears cannot make them retreat."
Joel,2,9,"They swarm over city walls and enter our homes; they crawl in through windows, just like thieves."
Joel,2,10,"They make the earth tremble and the heavens shake; the sun and moon turn dark, and stars stop shining."
Joel,2,11,"The LORD God leads this army of countless troops, and they obey his commands. The day of his judgment is so terrible that no one can stand it."
Joel,2,12,The LORD said: It isn't too late. You can still return to me with all your heart. Start crying and mourning! Go without eating.
Joel,2,13,"Don't rip your clothes to show your sorrow. Instead, turn back to me with broken hearts. I am merciful, kind, and caring. I don't easily lose my temper, and I don't like to punish."
Joel,2,14,I am the LORD your God. Perhaps I will change my mind and treat you with mercy. Then you will be blessed with enough grain and wine for offering sacrifices to me.
Joel,2,15,Sound the trumpet on Zion! Call the people together. Show your sorrow by going without food.
Joel,2,16,"Make sure that everyone is fit to worship me. Bring adults, children, babies, and even bring newlyweds from their festivities."
Joel,2,17,"Tell my servants, the priests, to cry inside the temple and to offer this prayer near the altar: “Save your people, LORD God! Don't let foreign nations make jokes about us. Don't let them laugh and ask, ‘Where is your God?’ ”"
Joel,2,18,The LORD was deeply concerned about his land and had pity on his people.
Joel,2,19,"In answer to their prayers he said, “I will give you enough grain, wine, and olive oil to satisfy your needs. No longer will I let you be insulted by the nations."
Joel,2,20,"An army attacked from the north, but I will chase it into a scorching desert. There it will rot and stink from the Dead Sea to the Mediterranean.” The LORD works wonders"
Joel,2,21,and does great things. So tell the soil to celebrate
Joel,2,22,and wild animals to stop being afraid. Grasslands are green again; fruit trees and fig trees are loaded with fruit. Grapevines are covered with grapes.
Joel,2,23,"People of Zion, celebrate in honour of the LORD your God! He is generous and has sent the autumn and spring rains in the proper seasons."
Joel,2,24,Grain will cover your threshing places; jars will overflow with wine and olive oil.
Joel,2,25,"I, the LORD your God, will make up for the losses caused by those swarms and swarms of locusts I sent to attack you."
Joel,2,26,"My people, you will eat until you are satisfied. Then you will praise me for the wonderful things I have done. Never again will you be put to shame."
Joel,2,27,"Israel, you will know that I stand at your side. I am the LORD your God— there are no other gods. Never again will you be put to shame."
Joel,2,28,"Later, I will give my Spirit to everyone. Your sons and daughters will prophesy. Your old men will have dreams, and your young men will see visions."
Joel,2,29,"In those days I will even give my Spirit to my servants, both men and women."
Joel,2,30,I will work wonders in the sky above and on the earth below. There will be blood and fire and clouds of smoke.
Joel,2,31,"The sun will turn dark, and the moon will be as red as blood before that great and terrible day when I appear."
Joel,2,32,"Then the LORD will save everyone who faithfully worships him. He has promised there will be survivors on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and among them will be his chosen ones."
Joel,3,1,"At that time I, the LORD , will make Judah and Jerusalem prosperous again."
Joel,3,2,"Then in Judgment Valley I will bring together the nations that scattered my people Israel everywhere in the world, and I will bring charges against those nations. They divided up my land"
Joel,3,3,and gambled to see who would get my people; they sold boys and girls to pay for prostitutes and wine.
Joel,3,4,"You people of Tyre and Sidon and you Philistines, why are you doing this? Are you trying to get even with me? I'll strike back before you know what's happened."
Joel,3,5,"You've taken my prized possessions, including my silver and gold, and carried them off to your temples."
Joel,3,6,You have dragged the people of Judah and Jerusalem from their land and sold them to the Greeks.
Joel,3,7,"But I'll make the people of Judah determined to come home, and what happened to them will happen to you."
Joel,3,8,"I'll hand over your sons and daughters to the people of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, who live far away. I, the LORD , have spoken!"
Joel,3,9,Say to the nations: “Get ready for war! Be eager to fight. Line up for battle and prepare to attack.
Joel,3,10,Make swords out of ploughs and spears out of garden tools. Strengthen every weakling.”
Joel,3,11,"Hurry, all you nations! Come quickly. Ask the LORD to bring his warriors along."
Joel,3,12,"You must come now to Judgment Valley, where the LORD will judge the surrounding nations."
Joel,3,13,"They are a field of ripe crops. Bring in the harvest! They are grapes piled high. Start trampling them now! If our enemy's sins were wine, every jar would overflow."
Joel,3,14,Crowds fill Decision Valley. The judgment day of the LORD will soon be here—
Joel,3,15,"no light from the sun or moon, and stars no longer shine."
Joel,3,16,"From the heart of Jerusalem the LORD roars like a lion, shaking the earth and sky. But the LORD is a fortress, a place of safety for his people Israel."
Joel,3,17,"I am the LORD your God. And you will know I live on Zion, my sacred hill, because Jerusalem will be sacred, untouched by foreign troops."
Joel,3,18,"On that day, fruitful vineyards will cover the mountains. And your cattle and goats that graze on the hills will produce a lot of milk. Streams in Judah will never run dry; a stream from my house will flow in Acacia Valley."
Joel,3,19,"Egypt and Edom were cruel and brutal to Judah, without a reason. Now their countries will become a barren desert,"
Joel,3,20,but Judah and Jerusalem will always have people.
Joel,3,21,"I, the LORD , live on Mount Zion. I will punish the guilty and defend the innocent."
Amos,1,1,"I am Amos. And I raised sheep near the town of Tekoa when Uzziah was king of Judah and Jeroboam son of Jehoash was king of Israel. Two years before the earthquake, the LORD gave me several messages about Israel,"
Amos,1,2,"and I said: When the LORD roars from Jerusalem, pasture lands and Mount Carmel dry up and turn brown."
Amos,1,3,"The LORD said: I will punish Syria for countless crimes, and I won't change my mind. They dragged logs with spikes over the people of Gilead."
Amos,1,4,Now I will burn down the palaces and fortresses of King Hazael and of King Benhadad.
Amos,1,5,"I will break through the gates of Damascus. I will destroy the people of Wicked Valley and the ruler of Beth-Eden. Then the Syrians will be dragged as prisoners to Kir. I, the LORD , have spoken!"
Amos,1,6,"The LORD said: I will punish Philistia for countless crimes, and I won't change my mind. They dragged off my people from town after town to sell them as slaves to the Edomites."
Amos,1,7,That's why I will burn down the walls and fortresses of the city of Gaza.
Amos,1,8,"I will destroy the king of Ashdod and the ruler of Ashkelon. I will strike down Ekron, and that will be the end of the Philistines. I, the LORD , have spoken!"
Amos,1,9,"The LORD said: I will punish Phoenicia for countless crimes, and I won't change my mind. They broke their treaty and dragged off my people from town after town to sell them as slaves to the Edomites."
Amos,1,10,That's why I will send flames to burn down the city of Tyre along with its fortresses.
Amos,1,11,"The LORD said: I will punish Edom for countless crimes, and I won't change my mind. They killed their own relatives and were so terribly furious that they showed no mercy."
Amos,1,12,Now I will send fire to wipe out the fortresses of Teman and Bozrah.
Amos,1,13,"The LORD said: I will punish Ammon for countless crimes, and I won't change my mind. In Gilead they ripped open pregnant women, just to take the land."
Amos,1,14,Now I will send fire to destroy the walls and fortresses of Rabbah. Enemies will shout and attack like a whirlwind.
Amos,1,15,"Ammon's king and leaders will be dragged away. I, the LORD , have spoken!"
Amos,2,1,"The LORD said: I will punish Moab for countless crimes, and I won't change my mind. They made lime from the bones of the king of Edom."
Amos,2,2,Now I will send fire to destroy the fortresses of Kerioth. Battle shouts and trumpet blasts will be heard as I destroy Moab
Amos,2,3,"with its king and leaders. I, the LORD , have spoken!"
Amos,2,4,"The LORD said: I will punish Judah for countless crimes, and I won't change my mind. They have rejected my teachings and refused to obey me. They were led astray by the same false gods their ancestors worshipped."
Amos,2,5,Now I will send fire on Judah and destroy the fortresses of Jerusalem.
Amos,2,6,"The LORD said: I will punish Israel for countless crimes, and I won't change my mind. They sell honest people for money, and the needy are sold for the price of sandals."
Amos,2,7,"They throw the poor to the ground and push aside those who are helpless. My holy name is dishonoured, because fathers and sons sleep with the same young women."
Amos,2,8,"They lie down beside altars on clothes taken as security for loans. And they drink wine in my temple, wine bought with the money they received from fines."
Amos,2,9,"Israel, the Amorites were there when you entered Canaan. They were tall as cedars and strong as oaks. But I wiped them out— I destroyed their branches and their roots."
Amos,2,10,"I had rescued you from Egypt, and for forty years I had led you through the desert. Then I gave you the land of the Amorites."
Amos,2,11,"I chose some of you to be prophets and others to be Nazirites. People of Israel, you know this is true. I, the LORD , have spoken!"
Amos,2,12,"But you commanded the prophets not to speak their message, and you pressured the Nazirites into drinking wine."
Amos,2,13,"And so I will crush you, just as a wagon full of grain crushes the ground."
Amos,2,14,"No matter how fast you run, you won't escape. No matter how strong you are, you will lose your strength and your life."
Amos,2,15,"Even if you are an expert with a bow and arrow, you will retreat. And you won't get away alive, not even if you run fast or ride a horse."
Amos,2,16,"You may be brave and strong, but you will run away, stripped naked. I, the LORD , have spoken!"
Amos,3,1,"People of Israel, I rescued you from Egypt. Now listen to my judgment against you."
Amos,3,2,"Of all nations on earth, you are the only one I have chosen. That's why I will punish you because of your sins."
Amos,3,3,Can two people walk together without agreeing to meet?
Amos,3,4,Does a lion roar in the forest unless it has caught a victim? Does it growl in its den unless it is eating?
Amos,3,5,How can anyone catch a bird without using a net? Does a trap spring shut unless something is caught?
Amos,3,6,Isn't the whole city frightened when the trumpet signals an attack? Isn't it the LORD who brings disaster on a city?
Amos,3,7,"Whatever the LORD God plans to do, he tells his servants, the prophets."
Amos,3,8,Everyone is terrified when a lion roars— and ordinary people become prophets when the LORD God speaks.
Amos,3,9,Here is a message for the leaders of Philistia and Egypt— tell everyone to come together on the hills of Samaria. Let them see the injustice and the lawlessness in that city.
Amos,3,10,The LORD has said that they don't even know how to do right. They have become rich from violence and robbery.
Amos,3,11,And so the LORD God has sworn that they will be surrounded. Enemies will break through their defences and steal their treasures.
Amos,3,12,The LORD has promised that only a few from Samaria will escape with their lives and with some broken pieces of their beds and couches. It will be like when a shepherd rescues two leg bones and part of a sheep's ear from the jaws of a lion.
Amos,3,13,The LORD God All-Powerful told me to speak this message against Jacob's descendants:
Amos,3,14,"When I, the LORD , punish Israel for their sins, I will destroy the altars at Bethel. Even the corners of the altar will be left in the dust."
Amos,3,15,"I will tear down winter homes and summer homes. Houses decorated with ivory and all other mansions will be gone for ever. I, the LORD , have spoken!"
Amos,4,1,"You women of Samaria are fat cows! You ill-treat and abuse the poor and needy, then you say to your husbands, “Bring us more drinks!”"
Amos,4,2,"I, the LORD God, have sworn by my own name that your time is coming. Not one of you will be left— you will be taken away by sharp hooks."
Amos,4,3,"You will be dragged through holes in your city walls, and you will be thrown towards Harmon. I, the LORD , have spoken!"
Amos,4,4,Come to Bethel and Gilgal. Sin all you want! Offer sacrifices the next morning and bring a tenth of your crops on the third day.
Amos,4,5,"Bring offerings to show me how thankful you are. Gladly bring more offerings than I have demanded. You really love to do this. I, the LORD God, have spoken!"
Amos,4,6,"I, the LORD , took away the food from every town and village, but still you rejected me."
Amos,4,7,"Three months before harvest, I kept back the rain. Sometimes I would let it fall on one town or field but not on another, and pastures dried up."
Amos,4,8,"People from two or three towns would go to a town that still had water, but it wasn't enough. Even then you rejected me. I, the LORD , have spoken!"
Amos,4,9,"I dried up your grain fields; your gardens and vineyards turned brown. Locusts ate your fig trees and olive orchards, but even then you rejected me. I, the LORD , have spoken!"
Amos,4,10,"I did terrible things to you, just as I did to Egypt— I killed your young men in war; I let your horses be stolen, and I made your camp stink with dead bodies. Even then you rejected me. I, the LORD , have spoken!"
Amos,4,11,"I destroyed many of you, just as I did the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. You were a burning stick I rescued from the fire. Even then you rejected me. I, the LORD , have spoken!"
Amos,4,12,"Now, Israel, I myself will deal with you. Get ready to face your God!"
Amos,4,13,I created the mountains and the wind. I let humans know what I am thinking. I bring darkness at dawn and step over hills. I am the LORD God All-Powerful!
Amos,5,1,"Listen, nation of Israel, to my mournful message:"
Amos,5,2,"you, dearest Israel, have fallen, never to rise again— you lie deserted in your own land, with no one to help you up."
Amos,5,3,"The LORD God has warned, “From every ten soldiers only one will be left; from a thousand troops, only a hundred will survive.”"
Amos,5,4,"The LORD keeps saying, “Israel, turn back to me and you will live!"
Amos,5,5,"Don't go to Gilgal or Bethel or even to Beersheba. Gilgal will be dragged away, and Bethel will end up as nothing.”"
Amos,5,6,"Turn back to the LORD, you descendants of Joseph, and you will live. If you don't, the LORD will attack like fire. Bethel will burn to the ground, and no one can save it."
Amos,5,7,You people are doomed! You twist the truth and trample on justice.
Amos,5,8,But the LORD created the stars and put them in place. He turns darkness to dawn and daylight to darkness; he scoops up the ocean and empties it on the earth.
Amos,5,9,God destroys mighty soldiers and strong fortresses.
Amos,5,10,You people hate judges and honest witnesses;
Amos,5,11,"you abuse the poor and demand heavy taxes from them. You have built expensive homes, but you won't enjoy them; you have planted vineyards, but you will get no wine."
Amos,5,12,"I am the LORD , and I know your terrible sins. You cheat honest people and take bribes; you rob the poor of justice."
Amos,5,13,Times are so evil that anyone with good sense will keep quiet.
Amos,5,14,"If you really want to live, you must stop doing wrong and start doing right. I, the LORD God All-Powerful, will then be on your side, just as you claim I am."
Amos,5,15,"Choose good instead of evil! See that justice is done. Perhaps I, the LORD All-Powerful, will be kind to what's left of your people."
Amos,5,16,"This is what the LORD has sworn: Noisy crying will be heard in every town and street. Even farmers will be told to mourn for the dead, together with those who are paid to mourn."
Amos,5,17,"Your vineyards will be filled with crying and weeping, because I will punish you. I, the LORD , have spoken!"
Amos,5,18,You look forward to the day when the LORD comes to judge. But you are in for trouble! It won't be a time of sunshine; all will be darkness.
Amos,5,19,"You will run from a lion, only to meet a bear. You will escape to your house, rest your hand on the wall, and be bitten by a snake."
Amos,5,20,"The day when the LORD judges will be dark, very dark, without a ray of light."
Amos,5,21,"I, the LORD , hate and despise your religious celebrations and your times of worship."
Amos,5,22,I won't accept your offerings or animal sacrifices— not even your very best.
Amos,5,23,No more of your noisy songs! I won't listen when you play your harps.
Amos,5,24,But let justice and fairness flow like a river that never runs dry.
Amos,5,25,"Israel, for forty years you wandered in the desert, without bringing offerings or sacrifices to me."
Amos,5,26,"Now you will have to carry the two idols you made— Sakkuth, the one you call king, and Kaiwan, the one you built in the shape of a star."
Amos,5,27,"I will force you to march as captives beyond Damascus. I, the LORD God All-Powerful, have spoken!"
Amos,6,1,"Do you rulers in Jerusalem and in the city of Samaria feel safe and at ease? Everyone bows down to you, and you think you are better than any other nation. But you are in for trouble!"
Amos,6,2,"Look what happened to the cities of Calneh, powerful Hamath, and Gath in Philistia. Are you greater than any of those kingdoms?"
Amos,6,3,"You are cruel, and you forget the coming day of judgment."
Amos,6,4,"You rich people lounge around on beds with ivory posts, while dining on the meat of your lambs and calves."
Amos,6,5,"You sing foolish songs to the music of harps, and you make up new tunes, just as David used to do."
Amos,6,6,"You drink all the wine you want and wear expensive perfume, but you don't care about the ruin of your nation."
Amos,6,7,So you will be the first to be dragged off as captives; your good times will end.
Amos,6,8,"The LORD God All-Powerful has sworn by his own name: “You descendants of Jacob make me angry by your pride, and I hate your fortresses. And so I will surrender your city and possessions to your enemies.”"
Amos,6,9,If only ten of you survive by hiding in a house you will still die.
Amos,6,10,"As you carry out a corpse to prepare it for burial, your relative in the house will ask, “Are there others?” You will answer, “No!” Then your relative will reply, “Be quiet! Don't dare mention the name of the LORD .”"
Amos,6,11,"At the LORD 's command, houses great and small will be smashed to pieces."
Amos,6,12,Horses can't gallop on rocks; oceans can't be ploughed. But you have turned justice and fairness into bitter poison.
Amos,6,13,"You celebrate the defeat of Lo-Debar and Karnaim, and you boast by saying, “We did it on our own.”"
Amos,6,14,"But the LORD God All-Powerful will send a nation to attack you people of Israel. They will capture Lebo-Hamath in the north, Arabah Brook in the south, and everything in between."
Amos,7,1,The LORD God showed me that he is going to send locusts to attack your crops. It will happen after the king has already been given his share of the grain and before the rest of the grain has been harvested.
Amos,7,2,"In my vision the locusts ate every crop in the land, and I said to the LORD , “Forgive me for asking, but how can the nation survive? It's so weak.”"
Amos,7,3,"Then the LORD felt sorry and answered, “I won't let it be destroyed.”"
Amos,7,4,"The LORD showed me that he is going to send a ball of fire to burn up everything on earth, including the sea."
Amos,7,5,"Then I said, “Won't you please stop? How can our weak nation survive?”"
Amos,7,6,"Again the LORD felt sorry and answered, “I won't let it be destroyed.”"
Amos,7,7,The LORD showed me a vision of himself standing beside a wall and holding a string with a weight tied to the end of it. The string and weight had been used to measure the straightness of the wall.
Amos,7,8,"Then he asked, “Amos, what do you see?” “A measuring line,” I answered. The LORD said, “I'm using this measuring line to show that my people Israel don't measure up, and I won't forgive them any more."
Amos,7,9,"Their sacred places will be destroyed, and I will send war against the nation of King Jeroboam.”"
Amos,7,10,"Amaziah the priest at Bethel sent this message to King Jeroboam of Israel, “Amos is plotting against you in the very heart of Israel. Our nation cannot put up with his message for very long."
Amos,7,11,"Here is what he is saying: ‘Jeroboam will be put to death, and the people will be taken to a foreign country.’ ”"
Amos,7,12,"Then Amaziah told me, “Amos, take your visions and get out! Go back to Judah and earn your living there as a prophet."
Amos,7,13,Don't do any more preaching at Bethel. The king worships here at our national temple.”
Amos,7,14,"I answered: I'm not a prophet! And I wasn't trained to be a prophet. I am a shepherd, and I take care of fig trees."
Amos,7,15,But the LORD told me to leave my herds and preach to the people of Israel.
Amos,7,16,"And here you are, telling me not to preach!"
Amos,7,17,"Now, listen to what the LORD says about you: Your wife will become a prostitute in the city, your sons and daughters will be killed in war, and your land will be divided among others. You will die in a country of foreigners, and the people of Israel will be dragged from their homeland."
Amos,8,1,The LORD God showed me a basket of ripe fruit
Amos,8,2,"and asked, “Amos, what do you see?” “A basket of ripe fruit,” I replied. Then he said, “This is the end for my people Israel. I won't forgive them again."
Amos,8,3,"Instead of singing in the temple, they will cry and weep. Dead bodies will be everywhere. So keep silent! I, the LORD , have spoken!”"
Amos,8,4,You people crush those in need and wipe out the poor.
Amos,8,5,"You say to yourselves, “How much longer before the end of the New Moon Festival? When will the Sabbath be over? Our wheat is ready, and we want to sell it now. We can't wait to cheat and charge high prices for the grain we sell. We will use dishonest scales"
Amos,8,6,and mix dust in the grain. Those who are needy and poor don't have any money. We will make them our slaves for the price of a pair of sandals.”
Amos,8,7,"I, the LORD , won't forget any of this, though you take great pride in your ancestor Jacob."
Amos,8,8,"Your country will tremble, and you will mourn. It will be like the River Nile that rises and overflows, then sinks back down."
Amos,8,9,"On that day, I, the LORD God, will make the sun go down at midday, and I will turn daylight into darkness."
Amos,8,10,"Your festivals and joyful singing will turn into sorrow. You will wear sackcloth and shave your heads, as you would at the death of your only son. It will be a horrible day."
Amos,8,11,"I, the LORD , also promise you a terrible shortage, but not of food and water. You will hunger and thirst to hear my message."
Amos,8,12,"You will search everywhere— from north to south, from east to west. You will go all over the earth, seeking a message from me, the LORD. But you won't find one."
Amos,8,13,Your beautiful young women and your young men will faint from thirst.
Amos,8,14,"You made promises in the name of Ashimah, the goddess of Samaria. And you made vows in my name at the shrines of Dan and Beersheba. But you will fall and never get up."
Amos,9,1,"I saw a vision of the LORD standing by the temple altar, and he said, “Shake the columns until the tops fall loose, and the doorposts crumble. Then make the pieces fall on the people below. I will take a sword and kill anyone who escapes."
Amos,9,2,"“If they dig deep into the earth or climb to the sky, I'll reach out and get them."
Amos,9,3,"If they escape to the peaks of Mount Carmel, I'll search and find them. And if they hide from me at the bottom of the ocean, I'll command a sea monster to bite them."
Amos,9,4,"I'll send a sword to kill them, wherever their enemies drag them off as captives. I'm determined to hurt them, not to help them.”"
Amos,9,5,"When the LORD God All-Powerful touches the earth, it melts, and its people mourn. God makes the earth rise and then fall, just like the River Nile."
Amos,9,6,He built his palace in the heavens and let its foundations rest on the earth. He scoops up the ocean and empties it on the earth. His name is the LORD.
Amos,9,7,"Israel, I am the LORD God, and the Ethiopians are no less important to me than you are. I brought you out of Egypt, but I also brought the Philistines from Crete and the Arameans from Kir."
Amos,9,8,"My eyes have seen what a sinful nation you are, and I'll wipe you out. But I will leave a few of Jacob's descendants. I, the LORD , have spoken!"
Amos,9,9,"At my command, all of you will be sifted like grain. Israelites who remain faithful will be scattered among the nations. And the others will be trapped like rubbish in a sieve."
Amos,9,10,"Some of you are evil, and you deny that you will ever get caught. But you will be killed."
Amos,9,11,"In the future, I will rebuild David's fallen kingdom. I will build it from its ruins and set it up again, just as it used to be."
Amos,9,12,"Then you will capture Edom and the other nations that are mine. I, the LORD , have spoken, and my words will come true."
Amos,9,13,You will have such a harvest that you won't be able to bring in all your wheat before ploughing time. You will have grapes left over from season to season; your fruitful vineyards will cover the mountains.
Amos,9,14,I'll make Israel prosper again. You will rebuild your towns and live in them. You will drink wine from your own vineyards and eat the fruit you grow.
Amos,9,15,"I'll plant your roots deep in the land I have given you, and you won't ever be uprooted again. I, the LORD God, have spoken!"
Obadiah,1,1,"The LORD God gave Obadiah a message about Edom, and this is what we heard: “I, the LORD , have sent a messenger with orders for the nations to attack Edom.”"
Obadiah,1,2,The LORD said to Edom: I will make you the weakest and most despised nation.
Obadiah,1,3,"You live in a mountain fortress, because your pride makes you feel safe from attack, but you are mistaken."
Obadiah,1,4,"I will still bring you down, even if you fly higher than an eagle or nest among the stars. I, the LORD , have spoken!"
Obadiah,1,5,"If thieves break in at night, they steal only what they want. And people who harvest grapes always leave some unpicked. But, Edom, you are doomed!"
Obadiah,1,6,Everything you treasure most will be taken from you.
Obadiah,1,7,"Your allies can't be trusted. They will force you out of your own country. Your best friends will trick and trap you, even before you know it."
Obadiah,1,8,"Edom, when this happens, I, the LORD , will destroy all your marvellous wisdom."
Obadiah,1,9,"Warriors from the city of Teman will be terrified, and you descendants of Esau will be wiped out."
Obadiah,1,10,"You were cruel to your relatives, the descendants of Jacob. Now you will be destroyed, disgraced for ever."
Obadiah,1,11,"You stood there and watched as foreigners entered Jerusalem and took what they wanted. In fact, you were no better than those foreigners."
Obadiah,1,12,Why did you celebrate when such a dreadful disaster struck your relatives? Why were you so pleased when everyone in Judah was suffering?
Obadiah,1,13,"They are my people, and you were cruel to them. You went through their towns, sneering and stealing whatever was left."
Obadiah,1,14,"In their time of torment, you ambushed refugees and handed them over to their attackers."
Obadiah,1,15,"The day is coming when I, the LORD, will judge the nations. And, Edom, you will pay in full for what you have done."
Obadiah,1,16,I forced the people of Judah to drink the wine of my anger on my sacred mountain. Soon the neighbouring nations must drink their fill— then vanish without a trace.
Obadiah,1,17,"The LORD 's people who escape will go to Mount Zion, and it will be holy. Then Jacob's descendants will capture the land of those who took their land."
Obadiah,1,18,"Israel will be a fire, and Edom will be straw going up in flames. The LORD has spoken!"
Obadiah,1,19,"The people of Israel who live in the Southern Desert will take the land of Edom. Those who live in the hills will capture Philistia, Ephraim, and Samaria. And the tribe of Benjamin will conquer Gilead."
Obadiah,1,20,Those who return from captivity will control Phoenicia as far as Zarephath. Captives from Jerusalem who were taken to Sepharad will capture the towns of the Southern Desert.
Obadiah,1,21,Those the LORD has saved will live on Mount Zion and rule over Edom. Then the kingdom will belong to the LORD.
Jonah,1,1,"One day the LORD told Jonah, the son of Amittai,"
Jonah,1,2,"to go to the great city of Nineveh and say to the people, “The LORD has seen your terrible sins. You are doomed!”"
Jonah,1,3,"Instead, Jonah ran from the LORD . He went to the seaport of Joppa and bought a ticket on a ship that was going to Spain. Then he got on the ship and sailed away to escape."
Jonah,1,4,"But the LORD made a strong wind blow, and such a bad storm came up that the ship was about to be broken to pieces."
Jonah,1,5,"The sailors were frightened, and they all started praying to their gods. They even threw the ship's cargo overboard to make the ship lighter. All this time, Jonah was down below deck, sound asleep."
Jonah,1,6,"The ship's captain went to him and said, “How can you sleep at a time like this? Get up and pray to your God! Perhaps he will have pity on us and keep us from drowning.”"
Jonah,1,7,"Finally, the sailors got together and said, “Let's ask our gods to show us who caused all this trouble.” It turned out to be Jonah."
Jonah,1,8,"They started asking him, “Are you the one who brought all this trouble on us? What business are you in? Where do you come from? What is your country? Who are your people?”"
Jonah,1,9,"Jonah answered, “I'm a Hebrew, and I worship the LORD God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land.”"
Jonah,1,10,"When the sailors heard this, they were frightened, because Jonah had already told them he was running from the LORD . Then they said, “Do you know what you have done?”"
Jonah,1,11,"The storm kept getting worse, until finally the sailors asked him, “What should we do with you to make the sea calm down?”"
Jonah,1,12,"Jonah told them, “Throw me into the sea, and it will calm down. I'm the cause of this terrible storm.”"
Jonah,1,13,"The sailors tried their best to row to the shore. But they could not do it, and the storm kept getting worse every minute."
Jonah,1,14,"So they prayed to the LORD , “Please don't let us drown for taking this man's life. Don't hold us guilty for killing an innocent man. All this happened because you wanted it to.”"
Jonah,1,15,"Then they threw Jonah overboard, and the sea calmed down."
Jonah,1,16,The sailors were so terrified that they offered a sacrifice to the LORD and made all kinds of promises.
Jonah,1,17,"The LORD sent a big fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was inside the fish for three days and three nights."
Jonah,2,1,"From inside the fish, Jonah prayed to the LORD his God:"
Jonah,2,2,"When I was in trouble, LORD, I prayed to you, and you listened to me. From deep in the world of the dead, I begged for your help, and you answered my prayer."
Jonah,2,3,You threw me down to the bottom of the sea. The water was churning all around; I was completely covered by your mighty waves.
Jonah,2,4,"I thought I was swept away from your sight, never again to see your holy temple."
Jonah,2,5,I was almost drowned by the swirling waters that surrounded me. Seaweed had wrapped around my head.
Jonah,2,6,"I had sunk down below the underwater mountains; I knew that for ever, I would be a prisoner there. But, you, LORD God, rescued me from that pit."
Jonah,2,7,"When my life was slipping away, I remembered you— and in your holy temple you heard my prayer."
Jonah,2,8,All who worship worthless idols turn from the God who offers them mercy.
Jonah,2,9,"But with shouts of praise, I will offer a sacrifice to you, my LORD. I will keep my promise, because you are the one with power to save."
Jonah,2,10,The LORD commanded the fish to vomit up Jonah on the shore. And it did.
Jonah,3,1,Once again the LORD told Jonah
Jonah,3,2,to go to that great city of Nineveh and preach his message of doom.
Jonah,3,3,Jonah obeyed the LORD and went to Nineveh. The city was so big that it took three days just to walk through it.
Jonah,3,4,"After walking for a day, Jonah warned the people, “Forty days from now, Nineveh will be destroyed!”"
Jonah,3,5,"They believed God's message and set a time when they would go without eating to show their sorrow. Then everyone in the city, no matter who they were, dressed in sackcloth."
Jonah,3,6,"When the king of Nineveh heard what was happening, he also dressed in sackcloth; he left the royal palace and sat in dust."
Jonah,4,1,Jonah was really upset and angry.
Jonah,4,2,"So he prayed: Our LORD , I knew from the very beginning that you wouldn't destroy Nineveh. That's why I left my own country and headed for Spain. You are a kind and merciful God, and you are very patient. You always show love, and you don't like to punish anyone, not even foreigners."
Jonah,4,3,Now let me die! I'd be better off dead.
Jonah,4,4,"The LORD replied, “What right do you have to be angry?”"
Jonah,4,5,"Jonah then left through the east gate of the city and made a shelter to protect himself from the sun. He sat under the shelter, waiting to see what would happen to Nineveh."
Jonah,4,6,"The LORD made a vine grow up to shade Jonah's head and protect him from the sun. Jonah was very happy to have the vine,"
Jonah,4,7,"but early the next morning the LORD sent a worm to chew on the vine, and the vine dried up."
Jonah,4,8,"During the day the LORD sent a scorching wind, and the sun beat down on Jonah's head, making him feel faint. Jonah was ready to die, and he shouted, “I wish I were dead!”"
Jonah,4,9,"But the LORD asked, “Jonah, do you have the right to be angry about the vine?” “Yes, I do,” he answered, “and I'm angry enough to die.”"
Jonah,4,10,"But the LORD said: You are concerned about a vine that you did not plant or take care of, a vine that grew up in one night and died the next."
Jonah,4,11,"In that city of Nineveh there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand people who cannot tell right from wrong, and many cattle are also there. Don't you think I should be concerned about that big city?"
Micah,1,1,"I am Micah from Moresheth. And this is the message about Samaria and Jerusalem that the LORD gave to me when Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah were the kings of Judah."
Micah,1,2,"Listen, all of you! Earth and everything on it, pay close attention. The LORD God accuses you from his holy temple."
Micah,1,3,And he will come down to crush underfoot every pagan altar.
Micah,1,4,Mountains will melt beneath his feet like wax beside a fire. Valleys will vanish like water rushing down a ravine.
Micah,1,5,"This will happen because of the terrible sins of Israel, the descendants of Jacob. Samaria has led Israel to sin, and pagan altars at Jerusalem have made Judah sin."
Micah,1,6,So the LORD will leave Samaria in ruins— merely an empty field where vineyards are planted. He will scatter its stones and destroy its foundations.
Micah,1,7,"Samaria's idols will be smashed, and the wages of temple prostitutes will be destroyed by fire. Silver and gold from those idols will then be used by foreigners as payment for prostitutes."
Micah,1,8,"Because of this tragedy, I go barefoot and naked. My crying and weeping sound like howling wolves or ostriches."
Micah,1,9,The nation is fatally wounded. Judah is doomed. Jerusalem will fall.
Micah,1,10,"Don't tell it in Gath! Don't even cry. Instead, roll in the dust at Beth-Leaphrah."
Micah,1,11,"Depart naked and ashamed, you people of Shaphir. The town of Bethezel mourns because no one from Zaanan went out to help."
Micah,1,12,"Everyone in Maroth hoped for the best, but the LORD sent disaster down on Jerusalem."
Micah,1,13,"Get the war chariots ready, you people of Lachish. You led Jerusalem into sin, just as Israel did."
Micah,1,14,Now you will have to give a going-away gift to Moresheth. Israel's kings will discover that they cannot trust the town of Achzib.
Micah,1,15,"People of Mareshah, the LORD will send someone to capture your town. Then Israel's glorious king will be forced to hide in Adullam Cave."
Micah,1,16,"Judah, shave your head as bald as a vulture and start mourning. Your precious children will be dragged off to a foreign country."
Micah,2,1,"Doomed! You're doomed! At night you lie in bed, making evil plans. And when morning comes, you do what you've planned because you have the power."
Micah,2,2,You grab any field or house that you want; you cheat families out of homes and land.
Micah,2,3,"But here is what the LORD says: “I am planning trouble for you. Your necks will be caught in a noose, and you will be disgraced in this time of disaster.”"
Micah,2,4,"When that happens, this sorrowful song will be sung about you: “Ruined! Completely ruined! The LORD has taken our land and given it to traitors.”"
Micah,2,5,And so you will never again own property among the LORD 's people.
Micah,2,6,"“Enough of your preaching!” That's what you tell me. “We won't be disgraced, so stop preaching!”"
Micah,2,7,"Descendants of Jacob, is it right for you to claim that the LORD did what he did because he was angry? Doesn't he always bless those who do right?"
Micah,2,8,"My people, you have even stolen clothes right off the backs of your unsuspecting soldiers returning home from battle."
Micah,2,9,You take over lovely homes that belong to the women of my nation. Then you cheat their children out of the inheritance that comes from the LORD.
Micah,2,10,"Get out of here, you crooks! You'll find no rest here. You're not fit to belong to the LORD 's people, and you will be destroyed."
Micah,2,11,"The only prophet you want is a liar who will say, “Drink and get drunk!”"
Micah,2,12,"I, the LORD , promise to bring together the people of Israel who have survived. I will gather them, just as a shepherd brings sheep together, and there will be many."
Micah,2,13,I will break down the gate and lead them out— then I will be their king.
Micah,3,1,"Listen to me, you rulers of Israel! You know right from wrong,"
Micah,3,2,"but you prefer to do evil instead of what is right. You skin my people alive. You strip off their flesh,"
Micah,3,3,"break their bones, cook it all in a pot, and gulp it down."
Micah,3,4,"Some day you will beg the LORD to help you, but he will turn away because of your sins."
Micah,3,5,"You lying prophets promise security for anyone who gives you food, but disaster for anyone who refuses to feed you. Here is what the LORD says to you prophets:"
Micah,3,6,"“You will live in the dark, far from the sight of the sun, with no message from me."
Micah,3,7,"You prophets and fortune-tellers will all be disgraced, with no message from me.”"
Micah,3,8,But the LORD has filled me with power and his Spirit. I have been given the courage to speak about justice and to tell you people of Israel that you have sinned.
Micah,3,9,"So listen to my message, you rulers of Israel! You hate justice and twist the truth."
Micah,3,10,You make cruelty and murder a way of life in Jerusalem.
Micah,3,11,"You leaders accept bribes for dishonest decisions. You priests and prophets teach and preach, but only for money. Then you say, “The LORD is on our side. No harm will come to us.”"
Micah,3,12,"And so, because of you, Jerusalem will be ploughed under and left in ruins. Thorns will cover the mountain where the temple now stands."
Micah,4,1,"In the future, the mountain with the LORD 's temple will be the highest of all. It will reach above the hills, and every nation will rush to it."
Micah,4,2,"People of many nations will come and say, “Let's go up to the mountain of the LORD God of Jacob and worship in his temple.” The LORD will teach us his Law from Jerusalem, and we will obey him."
Micah,4,3,He will settle arguments between distant and powerful nations. They will beat their swords and their spears into rakes and shovels; they will never again make war or attack one another.
Micah,4,4,"Everyone will find rest beneath their own fig trees or grapevines, and they will live in peace. This is a solemn promise of the LORD All-Powerful."
Micah,4,5,"Others may follow their gods, but we will always follow the LORD our God."
Micah,4,6,"The LORD said: At that time I will gather my people— the lame and the outcasts, and all into whose lives I have brought sorrow."
Micah,4,7,"Then the lame and the outcasts will belong to my people and become a strong nation. I, the LORD , will rule them from Mount Zion for ever."
Micah,4,8,"Mount Zion in Jerusalem, guardian of my people, you will rule again."
Micah,4,9,"Jerusalem, why are you crying? Don't you have a king? Have your advisers gone? Are you suffering like a woman in childbirth?"
Micah,4,10,"Keep on groaning with pain, you people of Jerusalem! If you escape from your city to the countryside, you will still be taken as prisoners to Babylonia. But later I will rescue you from your enemies."
Micah,4,11,"Zion, because of your sins you are surrounded by many nations who say, “We can hardly wait to see you disgraced.”"
Micah,4,12,"But they don't know that I, the LORD, have gathered them here to grind them like grain."
Micah,4,13,"Smash them to pieces, Zion! I'll let you be like a bull with iron horns and bronze hoofs. Crush those nations and bring their wealth to me, the LORD of the earth."
Micah,5,1,"Jerusalem, enemy troops have surrounded you; they have struck Israel's ruler in the face with a stick."
Micah,5,2,"Bethlehem Ephrath, you are one of the smallest towns in the nation of Judah. But the LORD will choose one of your people to rule the nation— someone whose family goes back to ancient times."
Micah,5,3,"The LORD will abandon Israel only until this ruler is born, and the rest of his family returns to Israel."
Micah,5,4,"Like a shepherd taking care of his sheep, this ruler will lead and care for his people by the power and glorious name of the LORD his God. His people will live securely, and the whole earth will know his true greatness,"
Micah,5,5,"because he will bring peace. Let Assyria attack our country and our palaces. We will counter-attack, led by a number of rulers"
Micah,5,6,"whose strong army will defeat the nation of Assyria. Yes, our leaders will rescue us, if those Assyrians dare to invade our land."
Micah,5,7,A few of Jacob's descendants survived and are scattered among the nations. But the LORD will let them cover the earth like dew and rain that refreshes the soil.
Micah,5,8,"At present they are scattered, but later they will attack, as though they were fierce lions pouncing on sheep. Their enemies will be torn to shreds, with no one to save them;"
Micah,5,9,"they will be helpless, completely destroyed."
Micah,5,10,"The LORD said: At that time I will wipe out your cavalry and chariots,"
Micah,5,11,as well as your cities and your fortresses.
Micah,5,12,I will stop you from telling fortunes and practising witchcraft.
Micah,5,13,"You will no longer worship the idols or stone images you have made— I will destroy them,"
Micah,5,14,together with the sacred poles and even your towns.
Micah,5,15,I will become furious and take revenge on the nations that refuse to obey me.
Micah,6,1,The LORD said to his people: Come and present your case to the hills and mountains.
Micah,6,2,"Israel, I am bringing charges against you— I call upon the mountains and the earth's firm foundation to be my witnesses."
Micah,6,3,"My people, have I wronged you in any way at all? Please tell me."
Micah,6,4,"I rescued you from Egypt, where you were slaves. I sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam to be your leaders."
Micah,6,5,"Don't forget the evil plans of King Balak of Moab or what Balaam son of Beor said to him. Remember how I, the LORD, saved you many times on your way from Acacia to Gilgal."
Micah,6,6,What offering should I bring when I bow down to worship the LORD God Most High? Should I try to please him by sacrificing calves a year old?
Micah,6,7,Will thousands of sheep or rivers of olive oil make God satisfied with me? Should I sacrifice to the LORD my firstborn child as payment for my terrible sins?
Micah,6,8,"The LORD God has told us what is right and what he demands: “See that justice is done, let mercy be your first concern, and humbly obey your God.”"
Micah,6,9,"I am the LORD, and it makes sense to respect my power to punish. So listen to my message for the city of Jerusalem:"
Micah,6,10,You store up stolen treasures and use dishonest scales.
Micah,6,11,"But I, the LORD , will punish you for cheating with weights and with measures."
Micah,6,12,"You rich people are violent, and everyone tells lies."
Micah,6,13,"Because of your sins, I will wound you and leave you ruined and defenceless."
Micah,6,14,"You will eat, but still be hungry; you will store up goods, but lose everything— I, the LORD , will let it all be captured in war."
Micah,6,15,You won't harvest what you plant or use the oil from your olive trees or drink the wine from grapes you grow.
Micah,6,16,"Jerusalem, this will happen because you followed the sinful example of kings Omri and Ahab. Now I will destroy you and your property. Then the people of every nation will make fun and insult you."
Micah,7,1,"I feel so empty inside— like someone starving for grapes or figs, after the vines and trees have all been picked clean."
Micah,7,2,No one is loyal to God; no one does right. Everyone is brutal and eager to deceive everyone else.
Micah,7,3,"People cooperate to commit crime. Judges and leaders demand bribes, and rulers cheat in court."
Micah,7,4,"The most honest of them is worse than a thorn patch. Your doom has come! Lookouts sound the warning, and everyone panics."
Micah,7,5,"Don't trust anyone, not even your best friend, and be careful what you say to the one you love."
Micah,7,6,"Sons refuse to respect their own fathers, daughters rebel against their own mothers, and daughters-in-law despise their mothers-in-law. Your family is now your enemy."
Micah,7,7,"But I trust the LORD God to save me, and I will wait for him to answer my prayer."
Micah,7,8,"My enemies, don't be glad because of my troubles! I may have fallen, but I will get up; I may be sitting in the dark, but the LORD is my light."
Micah,7,9,"I have sinned against the LORD. And so I must endure his anger, until he comes to my defence. But I know that I will see him making things right for me and leading me to the light."
Micah,7,10,"You, my enemies, said, “The LORD God is helpless.” Now each of you will be disgraced and put to shame. I will see you trampled like mud in the street."
Micah,7,11,"Towns of Judah, the day is coming when your walls will be rebuilt, and your boundaries enlarged."
Micah,7,12,"People will flock to you from Assyria and Egypt, from Babylonia and everywhere else."
Micah,7,13,Those nations will suffer disaster because of what they did.
Micah,7,14,"Lead your people, LORD! Come and be our shepherd. Grasslands surround us, but we live in a forest. So lead us to Bashan and Gilead, and let us find pasture as we did long ago."
Micah,7,15,"I, the LORD , will work miracles just as I did when I led you out of Egypt."
Micah,7,16,"Nations will see this and be ashamed because of their helpless armies. They will be in shock, unable to speak or hear,"
Micah,7,17,"because of their fear of me, your LORD and God. Then they will come trembling, crawling out of their fortresses like insects or snakes, lapping up the dust."
Micah,7,18,"Our God, no one is like you. We are all that is left of your chosen people, and you freely forgive our sin and guilt. You don't stay angry for ever; you're glad to have pity"
Micah,7,19,and pleased to be merciful. You will trample on our sins and throw them in the sea.
Micah,7,20,"You will keep your word and be faithful to Jacob and to Abraham, as you promised our ancestors many years ago."
Nahum,1,1,I am Nahum from Elkosh. And this is the message that I wrote down about Nineveh.
Nahum,1,2,"The LORD God demands loyalty. In his anger, he takes revenge on his enemies."
Nahum,1,3,"The LORD is powerful, yet patient; he makes sure that the guilty are always punished. He can be seen in storms and in whirlwinds; clouds are the dust from his feet."
Nahum,1,4,"At the LORD 's command, oceans and rivers dry up. Bashan, Mount Carmel, and Lebanon wither, and their flowers fade."
Nahum,1,5,"At the sight of the LORD, mountains and hills tremble and melt; the earth and its people shudder and shake."
Nahum,1,6,Who can stand the heat of his furious anger? It flashes out like fire and shatters stones.
Nahum,1,7,The LORD is good. He protects those who trust him in times of trouble.
Nahum,1,8,"But like a roaring flood, the LORD chases his enemies into dark places and destroys them."
Nahum,1,9,"So don't plot against the LORD! He wipes out his enemies, and they never revive."
Nahum,1,10,"They are like drunkards overcome by wine, or like dry thorn bushes burning in a fire."
Nahum,1,11,"Assyria, one of your rulers has made evil plans against the LORD."
Nahum,1,12,"But the LORD says, “Assyria, no matter how strong you are, you are doomed! My people Judah, I have troubled you before, but I won't do it again."
Nahum,1,13,I'll snap your chains and set you free from the Assyrians.”
Nahum,1,14,"Assyria, this is what else the LORD says to you: “Your name will be forgotten. I will destroy every idol in your temple, and I will send you to the grave, because you are worthless.”"
Nahum,1,15,"Look towards the mountains, people of Judah! Here comes a messenger with good news of peace. Celebrate your festivals. Keep your promises to God. Your evil enemies are destroyed and will never again invade your country."
Nahum,2,1,"Nineveh, someone is coming to attack and scatter you. Guard your fortresses! Watch the road! Be brave! Prepare for battle!"
Nahum,2,2,Judah and Israel are like trees with branches broken by their enemies. But the LORD is going to restore their power and glory.
Nahum,3,1,"Doom to the crime capital! Nineveh, city of murder and treachery,"
Nahum,3,2,"here is your fate— cracking whips, churning wheels; galloping horses, roaring chariots;"
Nahum,3,3,"cavalry attacking, swords and spears flashing; soldiers stumbling over piles of dead bodies."
Nahum,3,4,You were nothing more than a prostitute using your magical charms and witchcraft to attract and trap nations.
Nahum,3,5,"But I, the LORD All-Powerful, am now your enemy. I will pull up your skirt and let nations and kingdoms stare at your nakedness."
Nahum,3,6,"I will cover you with rubbish, treat you like trash, and rub you in the dirt."
Nahum,3,7,"Everyone who sees you will turn away and shout, “Nineveh is done for! Is anyone willing to mourn or to give her comfort?”"
Nahum,3,8,"Nineveh, do you feel safer than the city of Thebes? The River Nile was its wall of defence."
Nahum,3,9,Thebes trusted the mighty power of Ethiopia and Egypt; the nations of Put and Libya were her allies.
Nahum,3,10,"But she was captured and taken to a foreign country. Her children were murdered at every street corner. The members of her royal family were auctioned off, and her high officials were bound in chains."
Nahum,3,11,"Nineveh, now it's your turn! You will get drunk and try to hide from your enemy."
Nahum,3,12,"Your fortresses are fig trees with ripe figs. Merely shake the trees, and fruit will fall into every open mouth."
Nahum,3,13,Your army is weak. Fire has destroyed the crossbars on your city gates; now they stand wide open to your enemy.
Nahum,3,14,Your city is under attack. Haul in extra water! Strengthen your defences! Start making bricks! Stir the mortar!
Nahum,3,15,"You will still go up in flames and be cut down by swords that will wipe you out like wheat attacked by grasshoppers. So, go ahead and increase like a swarm of locusts!"
Nahum,3,16,"More merchants are in your city than there are stars in the sky— but they are like locusts that eat everything, then fly away."
Nahum,3,17,"Your guards and your officials are swarms of locusts. On a chilly day they settle on a fence, but when the sun comes out, they take off to who-knows-where."
Nahum,3,18,"King of Assyria, your officials and leaders sleep the eternal sleep, while your people are scattered in the mountains. Yes, your people are sheep without a shepherd."
Nahum,3,19,"You're fatally wounded. There's no hope for you. But everyone claps when they hear this news, because your constant cruelty has caused them pain."
Habakkuk,1,1,I am Habakkuk the prophet. And this is the message that the LORD gave me.
Habakkuk,1,2,"Our LORD , how long must I beg for your help before you listen? How long before you save us from all this violence?"
Habakkuk,1,3,"Why do you make me watch such terrible injustice? Why do you allow violence, lawlessness, crime, and cruelty to spread everywhere?"
Habakkuk,1,4,Laws cannot be enforced; justice is always the loser; criminals crowd out honest people and twist the laws around.
Habakkuk,1,5,"Look and be amazed at what's happening among the nations! Even if you were told, you would never believe what's taking place now."
Habakkuk,1,6,"I am sending the Babylonians. They are fierce and cruel— marching across the land, conquering cities and towns."
Habakkuk,1,7,How fearsome and frightening. Their only laws and rules are the ones they make up.
Habakkuk,1,8,"Their cavalry troops are faster than leopards, more ferocious than wolves hunting at sunset, and swifter than hungry eagles suddenly swooping down."
Habakkuk,1,9,"They are eager to destroy, and they gather captives like handfuls of sand."
Habakkuk,1,10,"They make fun of rulers and laugh at fortresses, while building earth mounds so they can capture cities."
Habakkuk,1,11,Then suddenly they disappear like a gust of wind— those sinful people who worship their own strength.
Habakkuk,1,12,"Holy LORD God, mighty rock, you are eternal, and we are safe from death. You are using those Babylonians to judge and punish others."
Habakkuk,1,13,But you can't stand sin or wrong. So don't sit by in silence while they gobble up people who are better than they are.
Habakkuk,1,14,The people you put on this earth are like fish or reptiles without a leader.
Habakkuk,1,15,Then an enemy comes along and takes them captive with hooks and nets. It makes him so happy
Habakkuk,1,16,"that he offers sacrifices to his fishing nets, because they make him rich and provide choice foods."
Habakkuk,1,17,Will he keep hauling in his nets and destroying nations without showing mercy?
Habakkuk,2,1,"While standing guard on the watchtower, I waited for the LORD 's answer, before explaining the reason for my complaint."
Habakkuk,2,2,Then the LORD told me: “I will give you my message in the form of a vision. Write it clearly enough to be read at a glance.
Habakkuk,2,3,"At the time I have decided, my words will come true. You can trust what I say about the future. It may take a long time, but keep on waiting— it will happen!"
Habakkuk,2,4,"“I, the LORD , refuse to accept anyone who is proud. Only those who live by faith are acceptable to me.”"
Habakkuk,2,5,"Wine is treacherous, and arrogant people are never satisfied. They are no less greedy than death itself— they open their mouths as wide as the world of the dead and swallow everyone."
Habakkuk,2,6,But they will be mocked with these words: You're doomed! You stored up stolen goods and cheated others of what belonged to them.
Habakkuk,2,7,"But without warning, those you owe will demand payment. Then you will become a frightened victim."
Habakkuk,2,8,You robbed cities and nations everywhere on earth and murdered their people. Now those who survived will be as cruel to you.
Habakkuk,2,9,"You're doomed! You made your family rich at the expense of others. You even said to yourself, “I'm above the law.”"
Habakkuk,2,10,But you will bring shame on your family and ruin to yourself for what you did to others.
Habakkuk,2,11,The very stones and wood in your home will testify against you.
Habakkuk,2,12,You're doomed! You built a city on crime and violence.
Habakkuk,2,13,But the LORD All-Powerful sends up in flames what nations and people work so hard to gain.
Habakkuk,2,14,"Just as water fills the sea, the land will be filled with people who know and honour the LORD."
Habakkuk,2,15,"You're doomed! You get your friends drunk, just to see them naked."
Habakkuk,2,16,"Now you will be disgraced instead of praised. The LORD will make you drunk, and when others see you naked, you will lose their respect."
Habakkuk,2,17,You destroyed trees and animals on Mount Lebanon; you were ruthless to towns and people everywhere. Now you will be terrorized.
Habakkuk,2,18,What is an idol worth? It's merely a false god. Why trust a speechless image made from wood or metal by human hands?
Habakkuk,2,19,"What can you learn from idols covered with silver or gold? They can't even breathe. Pity anyone who says to an idol of wood or stone, “Get up and do something!”"
Habakkuk,2,20,Let all the world be silent— the LORD is present in his holy temple.
Habakkuk,3,1,This is my prayer:
Habakkuk,3,2,"I know your reputation, LORD, and I am amazed at what you have done. Please turn from your anger and be merciful; do for us what you did for our ancestors."
Habakkuk,3,3,"You are the same Holy God who came from Teman and Paran to help us. The brightness of your glory covered the heavens, and your praises were heard everywhere on earth."
Habakkuk,3,4,"Your glory shone like the sun, and light flashed from your hands, hiding your mighty power."
Habakkuk,3,5,Dreadful diseases and plagues marched in front and followed behind.
Habakkuk,3,6,"When you stopped, the earth shook; when you stared, nations trembled; when you walked along your ancient paths, eternal mountains and hills crumbled and collapsed."
Habakkuk,3,7,The tents of desert tribes in Cushan and Midian were ripped apart.
Habakkuk,3,8,"Our LORD , were you angry with the monsters of the deep? You attacked in your chariot and wiped them out."
Habakkuk,3,9,Your arrows were ready and obeyed your commands. You split the earth apart with rivers and streams;
Habakkuk,3,10,mountains trembled at the sight of you; rain poured from the clouds; ocean waves roared and rose.
Habakkuk,3,11,"The sun and moon stood still, while your arrows and spears flashed like lightning."
Habakkuk,3,12,"In your furious anger, you trampled on nations"
Habakkuk,3,13,to rescue your people and save your chosen one. You crushed a nation's ruler and stripped his evil kingdom of its power.
Habakkuk,3,14,"His troops had come like a storm, hoping to scatter us and glad to gobble us up. To them we were refugees in hiding— but you smashed their heads with their own weapons."
Habakkuk,3,15,Then your chariots churned the waters of the sea.
Habakkuk,3,16,"When I heard this message, I felt weak from fear, and my lips quivered. My bones seemed to melt, and I stumbled around. But I will patiently wait. Some day those vicious enemies will be struck by disaster."
Habakkuk,3,17,"Fig trees may no longer bloom, or vineyards produce grapes; olive trees may be fruitless, and harvest time a failure; sheep pens may be empty, and cattle stalls vacant—"
Habakkuk,3,18,but I will still celebrate because the LORD God saves me.
Habakkuk,3,19,"The LORD gives me strength. He makes my feet as sure as those of a deer, and he helps me stand on the mountains. To the music director: Use stringed instruments."
Zephaniah,1,1,"I am Zephaniah, the son of Cushi, the grandson of Gedaliah, the great-grandson of Amariah, and the great-great-grandson of Hezekiah. When Josiah son of Amon was king of Judah, the LORD gave me this message."
Zephaniah,1,2,"I, the LORD , now promise to destroy everything on this earth—"
Zephaniah,1,3,"people and animals, birds and fish. Everyone who is evil will crash to the ground, and I will wipe out the entire human race."
Zephaniah,1,4,I will reach out to punish Judah and Jerusalem— nothing will remain of the god Baal; nothing will be remembered of his pagan priests.
Zephaniah,1,5,"Not a trace will be found of those who worship stars from their rooftops, or bow down to the god Milcom, while claiming loyalty to me, the LORD."
Zephaniah,1,6,Nothing will remain of anyone who has turned away and rejected me.
Zephaniah,1,7,"Be silent! I am the LORD God, and the time is near. I am preparing to sacrifice my people and to invite my guests."
Zephaniah,1,8,"On that day I will punish national leaders and sons of the king, along with all who follow foreign customs."
Zephaniah,1,9,I will punish worshippers of pagan gods and cruel palace officials who abuse their power.
Zephaniah,1,10,"I, the LORD , promise that on that day noisy crying will be heard from Fish Gate, New Town, and Upper Hills."
Zephaniah,1,11,"Everyone in Lower Hollow will mourn loudly, because merchants and money changers will be wiped out."
Zephaniah,1,12,"I'll search Jerusalem with lamps and punish those people who sit there unworried while thinking, “The LORD won't do anything, good or bad.”"
Zephaniah,1,13,"Their possessions will be taken, their homes left in ruins. They won't get to live in the houses they build, or drink wine from the grapes in their own vineyards."
Zephaniah,1,14,"The great day of the LORD is coming soon, very soon. On that terrible day, fearsome shouts of warriors will be heard everywhere."
Zephaniah,1,15,"It will be a time of anger— of trouble and torment, of disaster and destruction, of darkness and despair, of storm clouds and shadows,"
Zephaniah,1,16,of trumpet calls and battle cries against fortified cities and mighty fortresses.
Zephaniah,1,17,"The LORD warns everyone who has sinned against him, “I'll strike you blind! Then your blood and your insides will gush out like vomit."
Zephaniah,1,18,"Not even your silver or gold can save you on that day when I, the LORD , am angry. My anger will flare up like a furious fire scorching the earth and everyone on it.”"
Zephaniah,2,1,"You disgraceful nation, gather around,"
Zephaniah,2,2,before it's too late. The LORD has set a time when his fierce anger will strike like a storm and sweep you away.
Zephaniah,2,3,"If you humbly obey the LORD, then come and worship him. If you do right and are humble, perhaps you will be safe on that day when the LORD turns loose his anger."
Zephaniah,2,4,"Gaza and Ashkelon will be deserted and left in ruins. Ashdod will be emptied in broad daylight, and Ekron uprooted."
Zephaniah,2,5,"To you people of Philistia who live along the coast, the LORD has this to say: “I am now your enemy, and I'll wipe you out!”"
Zephaniah,2,6,Your coast will be changed into pasture land and sheep pens.
Zephaniah,2,7,"The LORD God hasn't forgotten those survivors in Judah, and he will help them— his people will take your land to use for pasture. And when evening comes, they will rest in houses at Ashkelon."
Zephaniah,3,1,"Too bad for that disgusting, corrupt, and lawless city!"
Zephaniah,3,2,"For ever rebellious and rejecting correction, Jerusalem refuses to trust or obey the LORD God."
Zephaniah,3,3,"Its officials are roaring lions, its judges are wolves; in the evening they attack, by morning nothing is left."
Zephaniah,3,4,Jerusalem's prophets are proud and not to be trusted. The priests have disgraced the place of worship and abused God's Law.
Zephaniah,3,5,"All who do evil are shameless, but the LORD does right and is always fair. With the dawn of each day, God brings about justice."
Zephaniah,3,6,The LORD wiped out nations and left fortresses crumbling in the dust. Their streets and towns were reduced to ruins and emptied of people.
Zephaniah,3,7,God felt certain that Jerusalem would learn to respect and obey him. Then he would hold back from punishing the city and not wipe it out. But everyone there was eager to start sinning again.
Zephaniah,3,8,"The LORD said: Just wait for the day when I accuse you nations. I have decided on a day, when I will bring together every nation and kingdom and punish them all in my fiery anger. I will become furious and destroy the earth."
Zephaniah,3,9,"I will purify each language and make those languages acceptable for praising me. Then, with hearts united, everyone will serve only me, the LORD."
Zephaniah,3,10,"From across the rivers of Ethiopia, my scattered people, my true worshippers, will bring offerings to me."
Zephaniah,3,11,"When that time comes, you won't rebel against me and be put to shame. I'll do away with those who are proud and arrogant. Never will any of them strut around on my holy mountain."
Zephaniah,3,12,"But I, the LORD , won't destroy any of your people who are truly humble and turn to me for safety."
Zephaniah,3,13,The people of Israel who survive will live right and refuse to tell lies. They will eat and rest with nothing to fear.
Zephaniah,3,14,"Everyone in Jerusalem and Judah, celebrate and shout with all your heart!"
Zephaniah,3,15,"Zion, your punishment is over. The LORD has forced your enemies to turn and retreat. Your LORD is King of Israel and stands at your side; you don't have to worry about any more troubles."
Zephaniah,3,16,"Jerusalem, the time is coming, when it will be said to you: “Don't be discouraged or grow weak from fear!"
Zephaniah,3,17,"The LORD your God wins victory after victory and is always with you. He celebrates and sings because of you, and he will refresh your life with his love.”"
Zephaniah,3,18,"The LORD has promised: Your sorrow has ended, and you can celebrate."
Zephaniah,3,19,"I will punish those who ill-treat you. I will bring together the lame and the outcasts, then they will be praised, instead of despised, in every country on earth."
Zephaniah,3,20,"I will lead you home, and with your own eyes you will see me bless you with all you once owned. Then you will be famous everywhere on this earth. I, the LORD , have spoken!"
Haggai,1,1,"On the first day of the sixth month of the second year that Darius was king of Persia, the LORD told Haggai the prophet to speak his message to the governor of Judah and to the high priest. So Haggai told Governor Zerubbabel and High Priest Joshua"
Zechariah,1,1,"I am the prophet Zechariah, the son of Berechiah and the grandson of Iddo. In the eighth month of the second year that Darius was king of Persia, the LORD told me to say:"
Zechariah,2,1,"This time I saw someone holding a measuring line,"
Zechariah,2,2,"and I asked, “Where are you going?” “To measure Jerusalem,” was the answer. “To find out how wide and long it is.”"
Zechariah,2,3,"The angel who had spoken to me was leaving, when another angel came up to him"
Zechariah,2,4,"and said, “Hurry! Tell that man with the measuring line that Jerusalem won't have any boundaries. It will be too full of people and animals even to have a wall."
Zechariah,2,5,"The LORD himself has promised to be a protective wall of fire surrounding Jerusalem, and he will be its shining glory in the heart of the city.”"
Zechariah,2,6,"The LORD says to his people, “Run! Escape from the land in the north, where I scattered you to the four winds."
Zechariah,2,7,Leave Babylonia and hurry back to Zion.”
Zechariah,2,8,"Then the glorious LORD All-Powerful ordered me to say to the nations that had raided and robbed Zion: Zion is as precious to the LORD as are his eyes. Whatever you do to Zion, you do to him."
Zechariah,2,9,"And so, he will put you in the power of your slaves, and they will raid and rob you. Then you will know that I am a prophet of the LORD All-Powerful."
Zechariah,2,10,"City of Zion, sing and celebrate! The LORD has promised to come and live with you."
Zechariah,2,11,"When he does, many nations will turn to him and become his people. At that time you will know that I am a prophet of the LORD All-Powerful."
Zechariah,2,12,"Then Judah will be his part of the holy land, and Jerusalem will again be his chosen city."
Zechariah,2,13,"Everyone, be silent! The LORD is present and moving about in his holy place."
Zechariah,3,1,"I was given another vision. This time Joshua the high priest was standing in front of the LORD 's angel. And there was Satan, standing at Joshua's right side, ready to accuse him."
Zechariah,3,2,"But the LORD said, “Satan, you are wrong. Jerusalem is my chosen city, and this man was rescued like a stick from a flaming fire.”"
Zechariah,3,3,Joshua's clothes were filthy.
Zechariah,3,4,"So the angel told some of the people to remove Joshua's filthy clothes. Then he said to Joshua, “This means you are forgiven. Now I will dress you in priestly clothes.”"
Zechariah,3,5,"I spoke up and said, “Also put a clean priestly turban on his head.” Then they dressed him in priestly clothes and put the turban on him, while the LORD 's angel stood there watching."
Zechariah,3,6,"After this, the angel encouraged Joshua by telling him that the LORD All-Powerful had promised:"
Zechariah,3,7,"If you truly obey me, I will put you in charge of my temple, including the courtyard around it, and you will be allowed to speak at any time with the angels standing beside me."
Zechariah,3,8,"Listen carefully, High Priest Joshua and all you other priests. You are a sign of things to come, because I am going to bring back my servant, the Chosen King."
Zechariah,3,9,"Joshua, I have placed in front of you a stone with seven sides. I will engrave something on that stone, and in a single day I will forgive this guilty country."
Zechariah,3,10,Then each of you will live at peace and entertain your friends in your own vineyard and under your own fig trees.
Zechariah,4,1,The angel who explained the visions woke me from what seemed like sleep.
Zechariah,4,2,"Then he asked, “What do you see?” “A solid gold lampstand with an oil container above it,” I answered. “On the stand are seven lamps, each with seven flames."
Zechariah,4,3,One olive tree is on the right side and another on the left of the oil container.
Zechariah,4,4,"But, sir, what do these mean?”"
Zechariah,4,5,"Then he asked, “Don't you know?” “No sir,” I replied."
Zechariah,4,6,"So the angel explained that it was the following message of the LORD to Zerubbabel: I am the LORD All-Powerful. So don't depend on your own power or strength, but on my Spirit."
Zechariah,4,7,"Zerubbabel, that mountain in front of you will be levelled to the ground. Then you will bring out the temple's most important stone and shout, “God has been very kind.”"
Zechariah,4,8,The LORD spoke to me again and said:
Zechariah,4,9,"Zerubbabel laid the foundation for the temple, and he will complete it. Then everyone will know that you were sent by me, the LORD All-Powerful."
Zechariah,4,10,Those who have made fun of this day of small beginnings will celebrate when they see Zerubbabel holding this important stone. Those seven lamps represent my eyes—the eyes of the LORD —and they see everything on this earth.
Zechariah,4,11,"Then I asked the angel, “What about the olive trees on each side of the lampstand? What do they represent?"
Zechariah,4,12,And what is the meaning of the two branches from which golden olive oil flows through the two gold pipes?”
Zechariah,4,13,"“Don't you know?” he asked. “No sir, I don't,” was my answer."
Zechariah,4,14,"Then he told me, “These branches are the two chosen leaders who stand beside the Lord of all the earth.”"
Zechariah,5,1,"When I looked the next time, I saw a flying scroll,"
Zechariah,5,2,"and the angel asked, “What do you see?” “A flying scroll,” I answered. “About nine metres long and four and a half metres wide.”"
Zechariah,5,3,"Then he told me: This scroll puts a curse on everyone in the land who steals or tells lies. The writing on one side tells about the destruction of those who steal, while the writing on the other side tells about the destruction of those who lie."
Zechariah,5,4,"The LORD All-Powerful has said, “I am sending this scroll into the house of everyone who is a robber or tells lies in my name, and it will remain there until every piece of wood and stone in that house crumbles.”"
Zechariah,5,5,"Now the angel who was there to explain the visions came over and said, “Look up and tell me what you see coming.”"
Zechariah,5,6,"“I don't know what it is,” was my reply. “It's a big basket,” he said. “And it shows what everyone in the land has in mind.”"
Zechariah,5,7,"The lead cover of the basket was opened, and in the basket was a woman."
Zechariah,5,8,"“This woman represents evil,” the angel explained. Then he threw her back into the basket and slammed the heavy cover down tight."
Zechariah,5,9,"Straight after this I saw two women coming through the sky like storks with wings outstretched in the wind. Suddenly they lifted the basket into the air,"
Zechariah,5,10,"and I asked the angel, “Where are they taking the basket?”"
Zechariah,5,11,"“To Babylonia,” he answered, “where they will build a house for the basket and set it down inside.”"
Zechariah,6,1,"Finally, I looked up and saw four chariots coming from between two bronze mountains."
Zechariah,6,2,"The first chariot was pulled by red horses, and the second by black horses;"
Zechariah,6,3,"the third chariot was pulled by white horses, and the fourth by spotted grey horses."
Zechariah,6,4,"“Sir,” I asked the angel. “What do these stand for?”"
Zechariah,6,5,"Then he explained, “These are the four winds of heaven, and now they are going out, after presenting themselves to the Lord of all the earth."
Zechariah,6,6,"The chariot with black horses goes towards the north, the chariot with white horses goes towards the west, and the one with spotted horses goes towards the south.”"
Zechariah,6,7,"The horses came out eager to patrol the earth, and the angel told them, “Start patrolling the earth.” When they had gone on their way,"
Zechariah,6,8,"he shouted to me, “Those that have gone to the country in the north will do what the LORD 's Spirit wants them to do there.”"
Zechariah,6,9,The LORD said to me:
Zechariah,7,1,"On the fourth day of Chislev, the ninth month of the fourth year that Darius was king of Persia, the LORD again spoke to me."
Zechariah,8,1,The LORD All-Powerful said to me:
Zechariah,8,2,I love Zion so much that her enemies make me angry.
Zechariah,8,3,"I will return to Jerusalem and live there on Mount Zion. Then Jerusalem will be known as my faithful city, and Zion will be known as my holy mountain."
Zechariah,8,4,"Very old people with walking sticks will once again sit around in Jerusalem,"
Zechariah,8,5,while boys and girls play in the streets.
Zechariah,8,6,"This may seem impossible for my people who are left, but it isn't impossible for me, the LORD All-Powerful."
Zechariah,8,7,"I will save those who were taken to lands in the east and the west,"
Zechariah,8,8,"and I will bring them to live in Jerusalem. They will be my people, and I will be their God, faithful to bring about justice."
Zechariah,8,9,I am the LORD All-Powerful! So don't give up. Think about the message my prophets spoke when the foundation of my temple was laid.
Zechariah,8,10,"Before that time, neither people nor animals were rewarded for their work, and no one was safe anywhere, because I had turned them against each other."
Zechariah,8,11,"My people, only a few of you are left, and I promise not to punish you as I did before."
Zechariah,8,12,"Instead, I will make sure that your crops are planted in peace and your vineyards are fruitful, that your fields are fertile and the dew falls from the sky."
Zechariah,8,13,"People of Judah and Israel, you have been a curse to the nations, but I will save you and make you a blessing to them. So don't be afraid or lose courage."
Zechariah,8,14,"When your ancestors made me angry, I decided to punish you with disasters, and I didn't hold back."
Zechariah,8,15,Now you no longer need to be afraid. I have decided to treat Jerusalem and Judah with kindness.
Zechariah,8,16,"But you must be truthful with each other, and in court you must give fair decisions that lead to peace."
Zechariah,8,17,"Don't ever plan evil things against others or tell lies under oath. I, the LORD , hate such things."
Zechariah,8,18,The LORD All-Powerful told me to say:
Zechariah,8,19,"People of Judah, I, the LORD , demand that whenever you go without food as a way of worshipping me, it should become a time of celebration. No matter if it's the fourth month, the fifth month, the seventh month, or the tenth month, you should have a joyful festival. So love truth and live at peace."
Zechariah,8,20,I tell you that people will come here from cities everywhere.
Zechariah,8,21,"Those of one town will go to another and say, “We're going to ask the LORD All-Powerful to treat us with kindness. Come and join us.”"
Zechariah,8,22,Many people from strong nations will come to Jerusalem to worship me and to ask me to treat them with kindness.
Zechariah,8,23,"When this happens, ten people from nations with different languages will grab a Jew by his clothes and say, “Let us go with you. We've heard that God is on your side.” I, the LORD All-Powerful, have spoken!"
Zechariah,9,1,"This is a message from the LORD: His eyes are on everyone, especially the tribes of Israel. So he pronounces judgment against the cities of Hadrach and Damascus."
Zechariah,9,2,"Judgment will also fall on the nearby city of Hamath, as well as on Tyre and Sidon, whose people are clever."
Zechariah,9,3,"Tyre has built a fortress and piled up silver and gold, as though they were dust or mud from the streets."
Zechariah,9,4,Now the Lord will punish Tyre with poverty; he will sink its ships and send it up in flames.
Zechariah,9,5,"Both Ashkelon and Gaza will tremble with fear; Ekron will lose all hope. Gaza's king will be killed, and Ashkelon emptied of its people."
Zechariah,9,6,"A mob of half-breeds will settle in Ashdod, and the Lord himself will rob Philistia of pride."
Zechariah,9,7,"No longer will the Philistines eat meat with blood in it or any unclean food. They will become part of the people of our God from the tribe of Judah. And God will accept the people of Ekron, as he did the Jebusites."
Zechariah,9,8,"God says, “I will stand guard to protect my temple from those who come to attack. I know what's happening, and no one will ill-treat my people ever again.”"
Zechariah,9,9,"Everyone in Jerusalem, celebrate and shout! Your king has won a victory, and he is coming to you. He is humble and rides on a donkey; he comes on the colt of a donkey."
Zechariah,9,10,"I, the LORD , will take away war chariots and horses from Israel and Jerusalem. Bows that were made for battle will be broken. I will bring peace to nations, and your king will rule from sea to sea. His kingdom will reach from the River Euphrates across the earth."
Zechariah,9,11,"When I made a sacred agreement with you, my people, we sealed it with blood. Now some of you are captives in waterless pits, but I will come to your rescue"
Zechariah,9,12,"and offer you hope. Return to your fortress, because today I will reward you with twice what you had."
Zechariah,9,13,I will use Judah as my bow and Israel as my arrow. I will take the people of Zion as my sword and attack the Greeks.
Zechariah,9,14,"Like a cloud, the LORD God will appear over his people, and his arrows will flash like lightning. God will sound his trumpet and attack in a whirlwind from the south."
Zechariah,9,15,"The LORD All-Powerful will protect his people, and they will trample down the sharpshooters and their slingshots. They will drink and get rowdy; they will be as full as a bowl at the time of sacrifice."
Zechariah,9,16,"The LORD God will save them on that day, because they are his people, and they will shine on his land like jewels in a crown."
Zechariah,9,17,How lovely they will be. Young people will grow there like grain in a field or grapes in a vineyard.
Zechariah,10,1,"I, the LORD , am the one who sends storm clouds and showers of rain to make fields produce. So when the crops need rain, you should pray to me."
Zechariah,10,2,"You can't believe idols and fortune-tellers, or depend on the hope you receive from witchcraft and interpreters of dreams. But you have tried all of these, and now you are like sheep without a shepherd."
Zechariah,10,3,"I, the LORD All-Powerful, am fiercely angry with you leaders, and I will punish you. I care for my people, the nation of Judah, and I will change this flock of sheep into charging war horses."
Zechariah,10,4,From this flock will come leaders who will be strong like cornerstones and tent pegs and weapons of war.
Zechariah,10,5,"They will join in the fighting, and together they will trample their enemies like mud. They will fight, because I, the LORD, will be on their side. And they will crush the enemy cavalry."
Zechariah,10,6,"I will strengthen the kingdoms of Judah and Israel. And I will show mercy because I am the LORD, their God. I will answer their prayers and bring them home. Then it will seem as though I had never rejected them."
Zechariah,10,7,"Israel will be like a tribe of warriors celebrating with wine. When their children see this, they will also be happy because of me, the LORD."
Zechariah,10,8,I will give a signal for them to come together because I have rescued them. And there will be as many as ever before.
Zechariah,10,9,"Although I scattered my people in distant countries, they won't forget me. Once their children are raised, they will return—"
Zechariah,10,10,"I will bring them home from Egypt and Assyria, then let them settle as far as Gilead and Lebanon, until the land overflows with them."
Zechariah,10,11,"My people will go through an ocean of troubles, but I will overcome the waves and dry up the deepest part of the Nile. Assyria's great pride will be put down, and the power of Egypt will disappear."
Zechariah,10,12,"I'll strengthen my people because of who I am, and they will follow me. I, the LORD , have spoken!"
Zechariah,11,1,"Lebanon, open your gates! Let the fire come in to destroy your cedar trees."
Zechariah,11,2,"Cry, you cypress trees! The glorious cedars have fallen and are rotting. Cry, you oak trees of Bashan! The dense forest has been chopped down."
Zechariah,11,3,Listen! Shepherds are crying. Their glorious pastures have been ruined. Listen! Lions are roaring. The forests of the Jordan Valley are no more to be found.
Zechariah,11,4,The LORD my God said to me: Tend those sheep doomed for slaughter!
Zechariah,11,5,"The people who buy and butcher them go unpunished, while everyone who sells them says, “Praise the LORD ! I'm rich.” Not even their shepherds have pity on them."
Zechariah,11,6,"Tend those sheep because I, the LORD , will no longer have pity on the people of this earth. I'll turn neighbour against neighbour and make them slaves of a king. They will bring disaster on the earth, and I'll do nothing to rescue any of them."
Zechariah,11,7,So I became a shepherd of those sheep doomed to be slaughtered by the sheep dealers. And I gave names to the two sticks I used for tending the sheep: one of them was named “Mercy” and the other “Unity”.
Zechariah,11,8,"In less than a month, I became impatient with three shepherds who didn't like me, and I got rid of them."
Zechariah,11,9,"Then I said, “I refuse to be your shepherd. Let the sheep that are going to die, go on and die, and those that are going to be destroyed, go on and be destroyed. Then let the others eat one another alive.”"
Zechariah,11,10,"On that same day, I broke the stick named “Mercy” to show that the LORD had cancelled his agreement with all people."
Zechariah,11,11,The sheep dealers who saw me knew straight away that this was a message from the LORD.
Zechariah,12,1,This is a message from the LORD about Israel: I am the LORD ! I stretched out the heavens; I put the earth on its foundations and gave breath to humans.
Zechariah,12,2,"I have decided that Jerusalem will become a bowl of wine that makes the neighbouring nations drunk. And when Jerusalem is attacked, Judah will also be attacked."
Zechariah,12,3,"But I will turn Jerusalem into a heavy stone that crushes anyone who tries to lift it. When all nations on earth surround Jerusalem,"
Zechariah,12,4,"I will make every horse panic and every rider confused. But at the same time, I will watch over Judah."
Zechariah,12,5,"Then every clan in Judah will realize that I, the LORD All-Powerful, am their God, and that I am the source of their strength."
Zechariah,12,6,At that time I will let the clans of Judah be like a ball of fire in a wood pile or a fiery torch in a hay stack. Then Judah will send the surrounding nations up in smoke. And once again the city of Jerusalem will be filled with people.
Zechariah,12,7,"But I will first give victory to Judah, so the kingdom of David and the city of Jerusalem in all their glory won't be thought of more highly than Judah itself."
Zechariah,12,8,"I, the LORD God, will protect Jerusalem. Even the weakest person there will be as strong as David, and David's kingdom will rule as though my very own angel were its leader."
Zechariah,12,9,I am determined to wipe out every nation that attacks Jerusalem.
Zechariah,12,10,"I, the LORD , will make the descendants of David and the people of Jerusalem feel deep sorrow and pray when they see the one they pierced with a spear. They will mourn and weep for him, as parents weep over the death of their only child or their firstborn."
Zechariah,12,11,On that day the people of Jerusalem will mourn as much as everyone did for Hadad Rimmon on the flat lands near Megiddo.
Zechariah,12,12,"Everyone of each family in the land will mourn, and the men will mourn separately from the women. This includes those from the family of David, and the families of Nathan,"
Zechariah,12,13,"Levi, Shimei,"
Zechariah,12,14,and all other families as well.
Zechariah,13,1,"In the future there will be a fountain, where David's descendants and the people of Jerusalem can wash away their sin and guilt."
Zechariah,13,2,"The LORD All-Powerful says: When that time comes, I will get rid of every idol in the country, and they will be forgotten for ever. I will also do away with their prophets and those evil spirits that control them."
Zechariah,13,3,"If any such prophets ever appear again, their own parents must warn them that they will die for telling lies in my name—the name of the LORD . If those prophets don't stop speaking, their parents must then kill them with a sword."
Zechariah,13,4,"Those prophets will be ashamed of their so called visions, and they won't deceive anyone by dressing like a true prophet."
Zechariah,13,5,"Instead, they will say, “I'm no prophet. I've been a farmer all my life.”"
Zechariah,13,6,"And if any of them are asked why they are wounded, they will answer, “It happened at the house of some friends.”"
Zechariah,13,7,"The LORD All-Powerful said: My sword, wake up! Attack my shepherd and friend. Strike down the shepherd! Scatter the little sheep, and I will destroy them."
Zechariah,13,8,Nowhere in the land will more than a third of them be left alive.
Zechariah,13,9,"Then I will purify them and put them to the test, just as gold and silver are purified and tested. They will pray in my name, and I will answer them. I will say, “You are my people,” and they will reply, “You, LORD , are our God!”"
Zechariah,14,1,"The LORD will have his day. And when it comes, everything that was ever taken from Jerusalem will be returned and divided among its people."
Zechariah,14,2,"But first, he will bring many nations to attack Jerusalem—homes will be robbed, women raped, and half of the population dragged off, though the others will be allowed to remain."
Zechariah,14,3,The LORD will attack those nations like a warrior fighting in battle.
Zechariah,14,4,"He will take his stand on the Mount of Olives east of Jerusalem, and the mountain will split in half, forming a wide valley that runs from east to west."
Zechariah,14,5,"Then you people will escape from the LORD 's mountain, through this valley, which reaches to Azal. You will run in all directions, just as everyone did when the earthquake struck in the time of King Uzziah of Judah. Afterwards, the LORD my God will appear with his holy angels."
Zechariah,14,6,It will be a bright day that won't turn cloudy.
Zechariah,14,7,And the LORD has decided when it will happen—this time of unending day.
Zechariah,14,8,"In both summer and winter, life-giving streams will flow from Jerusalem, half of them to the Dead Sea in the east and half to the Mediterranean Sea in the west."
Zechariah,14,9,Then there will be only one LORD who rules as King and whose name is worshipped everywhere on earth.
Malachi,1,1,I am Malachi. And this is the message that the LORD gave me for Israel.
Malachi,1,2,"Israel, I, the LORD , have loved you. And yet you ask in what way have I loved you. Don't forget that Esau was the brother of your ancestor Jacob, but I chose Jacob"
Malachi,1,3,instead of Esau. And I turned Esau's hill country into a barren desert where jackals roam.
Malachi,1,4,"Esau's descendants may say, “Although our nation Edom is in ruins, we will rebuild.” But I, the LORD All-Powerful, promise to tear down whatever they build. Then everyone will know that I will never stop being angry with them as long as they are so sinful."
Malachi,1,5,"Israel, when you see this, you will shout, “The LORD 's great reputation reaches beyond our borders.”"
Malachi,1,6,"I, the LORD All-Powerful, have something to say to you priests. Children respect their fathers, and servants respect their masters. I am your father and your master, so why don't you respect me? You priests have insulted me, and now you ask, “How did we insult you?”"
Malachi,1,7,"You embarrass me by offering worthless food on my altar. Then you ask, “How have we embarrassed you?” You have done it by saying, “What's so great about the LORD 's altar?”"
Malachi,1,8,"But isn't it wrong to offer animals that are blind, crippled, or sick? Just try giving those animals to your governor. That certainly wouldn't please him or make him want to help you."
Malachi,1,9,"I am the LORD God All-Powerful, and you had better try to please me. You have sinned. Now see if I will have mercy on any of you."
Malachi,1,10,"I wish someone would lock the doors of my temple, so you would stop wasting time building fires on my altar. I am not pleased with you priests, and I refuse to accept any more of your offerings."
Malachi,1,11,"From dawn until dusk my name is praised by every nation on this earth, as they burn incense and offer the proper sacrifices to me."
Malachi,1,12,"But even you priests insult me by saying, “There's nothing special about the LORD 's altar, and these sacrifices are worthless.”"
Malachi,1,13,"You get so disgusted that you even make vulgar signs at me. And for an offering, you bring stolen animals or those that are crippled or sick. Should I accept these?"
Malachi,1,14,"Instead of offering the acceptable animals you have promised, you bring me those that are unhealthy. I will punish you for this, because I am the great King, the LORD All-Powerful, and I am worshipped by nations everywhere."
Malachi,2,1,"I, the LORD All-Powerful, have something else to say to you priests."
Malachi,2,2,"You had better take seriously the need to honour my name. Otherwise, when you give a blessing, I will turn it into a curse. In fact, I have already done this, because you haven't taken to heart your duties as priests."
Malachi,2,3,"I will punish your descendants and rub your faces in the manure from your animal sacrifices, and then be done with you."
Malachi,2,4,"I am telling you this, so I can continue to keep my agreement with your ancestor Levi."
Malachi,2,5,"I blessed him with a full life, as I had promised, and he kept his part of the agreement by honouring me and respecting my name."
Malachi,2,6,"He taught the truth and never told lies, and he led a lot of people to turn from sin, because he obeyed me and lived right."
Malachi,2,7,"You priests should be eager to spread knowledge, and everyone should come to you for instruction, because you speak for me, the LORD All-Powerful."
Malachi,2,8,"But you have turned your backs on me. Your teachings have led others to do sinful things, and you have broken the agreement I made with your ancestor Levi."
Malachi,2,9,"So I caused everyone to hate and despise you, because you disobeyed me and failed to treat all people alike."
Malachi,2,10,Don't you know that we all have God as our Father? Didn't the one God create each of us? Then why do you cheat each other by breaking the agreement God made with your ancestors?
Malachi,2,11,"You people in Judah and Jerusalem have been unfaithful to the LORD . You have disgraced the temple that he loves, and you have committed the disgusting sin of worshipping other gods."
Malachi,2,12,"I pray that the LORD will no longer let those who are guilty belong to his people, even if they eagerly decide to offer the LORD a gift."
Malachi,2,13,"And what else are you doing? You cry noisily and flood the LORD 's altar with your tears, because he isn't pleased with your offerings and refuses to accept them."
Malachi,2,14,"And why isn't God pleased? It's because he knows that each of you men has been unfaithful to the wife you married when you were young. You promised that she would be your partner, but now you have broken that promise."
Malachi,2,15,"Didn't God create you to become like one person with your wife? And why did he do this? It was so you would have children, and then lead them to become God's people. Don't ever be unfaithful to your wife."
Malachi,2,16,The LORD God All-Powerful of Israel hates anyone who is cruel enough to divorce his wife. So take care never to be unfaithful!
Malachi,2,17,"You have worn out the LORD with your words. And yet, you ask, “How did we do that?” You did it by saying, “The LORD is pleased with evil and doesn't care about justice.”"
Malachi,3,1,"I, the LORD All-Powerful, will send my messenger to prepare the way for me. Then suddenly the Lord you are looking for will appear in his temple. The messenger you desire is coming with my promise, and he is on his way."
Malachi,3,2,"On the day the Lord comes, he will be like a furnace that purifies silver or like strong soap in a washbasin. No one will be able to stand up to him."
Malachi,3,3,"The LORD will purify the descendants of Levi, as though they were gold or silver. Then they will bring the proper offerings to the LORD,"
Malachi,3,4,"and the offerings of the people of Judah and Jerusalem will please him, just as they did in the past."
Malachi,3,5,The LORD All-Powerful said: I'm now on my way to judge you. And I will quickly condemn all who practise witchcraft or cheat in marriage or tell lies in court or rob workers of their pay or ill-treat widows and orphans or steal the property of foreigners or refuse to respect me.
Malachi,3,6,"Descendants of Jacob, I am the LORD All-Powerful, and I never change. That's why you haven't been wiped out,"
Malachi,3,7,"even though you have ignored and disobeyed my laws ever since the time of your ancestors. But if you return to me, I will return to you. And yet you ask, “How can we return?”"
Malachi,3,8,"You people are robbing me, your God. And, here you are, asking, “How are we robbing you?” You are robbing me of the offerings and of the ten per cent that belongs to me."
Malachi,3,9,That's why your whole nation is under a curse.
Malachi,3,10,"I am the LORD All-Powerful, and I challenge you to put me to the test. Bring the entire ten per cent into the storehouse, so there will be food in my house. Then I will open the windows of heaven and flood you with blessing after blessing."
Malachi,3,11,I will also stop locusts from destroying your crops and keeping your vineyards from producing.
Malachi,3,12,"Everyone of every nation will talk about how I have blessed you and about your wonderful land. I, the LORD All-Powerful, have spoken!"
Malachi,3,13,"You have said horrible things about me, and yet you ask, “What have we said?”"
Malachi,3,14,Here is what you have said: “It's foolish to serve the LORD God All-Powerful. What do we get for obeying him and from going around looking sad?
Malachi,3,15,"See how happy those arrogant people are. Everyone who does wrong is successful, and when they put God to the test, they always get away with it.”"
Malachi,3,16,"All those who truly respected the LORD and honoured his name started discussing these things, and when God saw what was happening, he had their names written as a reminder in his book."
Malachi,3,17,"Then the LORD All-Powerful said: You people are precious to me, and when I come to bring justice, I will protect you, just as parents protect an obedient child."
Malachi,3,18,Then everyone will once again see the difference between those who obey me by doing right and those who reject me by doing wrong.
Malachi,4,1,"The day of judgment is certain to come. And it will be like a red-hot furnace with flames that burn up proud and sinful people, as though they were straw. Not a branch or a root will be left. I, the LORD All-Powerful, have spoken!"
Malachi,4,2,"But for you who honour my name, victory will shine like the sun with healing in its rays, and you will jump around like calves at play."
Malachi,4,3,"When I come to bring justice, you will trample those who are evil, as though they were ashes under your feet. I, the LORD All-Powerful, have spoken!"
Malachi,4,4,Don't ever forget the laws and teachings I gave my servant Moses on Mount Sinai.
Malachi,4,5,"I, the LORD , promise to send the prophet Elijah before that great and terrible day comes."
Malachi,4,6,"He will lead children and parents to love each other more, so that when I come, I won't bring doom to the land."
Matthew,1,1,Jesus Christ came from the family of King David and also from the family of Abraham. And this is a list of his ancestors.
Matthew,2,1,"When Jesus was born in the village of Bethlehem in Judea, Herod was king. During this time some wise men from the east came to Jerusalem"
Matthew,2,2,"and said, “Where is the child born to be king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him.”"
Matthew,2,3,"When King Herod heard about this, he was worried, and so was everyone else in Jerusalem."
Matthew,2,4,"Herod brought together the chief priests and the teachers of the Law of Moses and asked them, “Where will the Messiah be born?”"
Matthew,2,5,"They told him, “He will be born in Bethlehem, just as the prophet wrote,"
Matthew,2,6,"‘Bethlehem in the land of Judea, you are very important among the towns of Judea. From your town will come a leader, who will be like a shepherd for my people Israel.’ ”"
Matthew,2,7,Herod secretly called in the wise men and asked them when they had first seen the star.
Matthew,2,8,"He told them, “Go to Bethlehem and search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, let me know. I want to go and worship him too.”"
Matthew,2,9,The wise men listened to what the king said and then left. And the star they had seen in the east went on ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was.
Matthew,2,10,They were thrilled and excited to see the star.
Matthew,2,11,"When the men went into the house and saw the child with Mary, his mother, they knelt down and worshipped him. They took out their gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh and gave them to him."
Matthew,2,12,"Later they were warned in a dream not to return to Herod, and they went back home by another road."
Matthew,2,13,"After the wise men had gone, an angel from the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, “Get up! Hurry and take the child and his mother to Egypt! Stay there until I tell you to return, because Herod is looking for the child and wants to kill him.”"
Matthew,2,14,"That night, Joseph got up and took his wife and the child to Egypt,"
Matthew,2,15,"where they stayed until Herod died. So the Lord's promise came true, just as the prophet had said, “I called my son out of Egypt.”"
Matthew,2,16,"When Herod found out that the wise men from the east had tricked him, he was very angry. He gave orders for his men to kill all the boys who lived in or near Bethlehem and were two years old and younger. This was based on what he had learnt from the wise men."
Matthew,2,17,"So the Lord's promise came true, just as the prophet Jeremiah had said,"
Matthew,2,18,"“In Ramah a voice was heard crying and weeping loudly. Rachel was mourning for her children, and she refused to be comforted, because they were dead.”"
Matthew,2,19,"After King Herod died, an angel from the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph while he was still in Egypt."
Matthew,2,20,"The angel said, “Get up and take the child and his mother back to Israel. The people who wanted to kill him are now dead.”"
Matthew,2,21,Joseph got up and left with them for Israel.
Matthew,2,22,"But when he heard that Herod's son Archelaus was now ruler of Judea, he was afraid to go there. Then in a dream he was told to go to Galilee,"
Matthew,2,23,"and they went to live there in the town of Nazareth. So the Lord's promise came true, just as the prophet had said, “He will be called a Nazarene.”"
Matthew,3,1,"Years later, John the Baptist started preaching in the desert of Judea."
Matthew,3,2,"He said, “Turn back to God! The kingdom of heaven will soon be here.”"
Matthew,3,3,"John was the one the prophet Isaiah was talking about, when he said, “In the desert someone is shouting, ‘Get the road ready for the Lord! Make a straight path for him.’ ”"
Matthew,3,4,John wore clothes made of camel's hair. He had a leather strap around his waist and ate grasshoppers and wild honey.
Matthew,3,5,From Jerusalem and all Judea and from the River Jordan Valley crowds of people went to John.
Matthew,3,6,"They told how sorry they were for their sins, and he baptized them in the river."
Matthew,3,7,Many Pharisees and Sadducees also came to be baptized. But John said to them: You snakes! Who warned you to run from the coming judgment?
Matthew,3,8,Do something to show that you have really given up your sins.
Matthew,3,9,And don't start telling yourselves that you belong to Abraham's family. I tell you that God can turn these stones into children for Abraham.
Matthew,3,10,An axe is ready to cut the trees down at their roots. Any tree that doesn't produce good fruit will be chopped down and thrown into a fire.
Matthew,3,11,"I baptize you with water so that you will give up your sins. But someone more powerful is going to come, and I am not good enough even to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire."
Matthew,3,12,"His threshing fork is in his hand, and he is ready to separate the wheat from the husks. He will store the wheat in a barn and burn the husks in a fire that never goes out."
Matthew,3,13,Jesus left Galilee and went to the River Jordan to be baptized by John.
Matthew,3,14,"But John kept objecting and said, “I ought to be baptized by you. Why have you come to me?”"
Matthew,3,15,"Jesus answered, “For now this is how it should be, because we must do all that God wants us to do.” Then John agreed."
Matthew,3,16,"So Jesus was baptized. And as soon as he came out of the water, the sky opened, and he saw the Spirit of God coming down on him like a dove."
Matthew,3,17,"Then a voice from heaven said, “This is my own dear Son, and I am pleased with him.”"
Matthew,4,1,"The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the desert, so that the devil could test him."
Matthew,4,2,"After Jesus had gone without eating for forty days and nights, he was very hungry."
Matthew,4,3,"Then the devil came to him and said, “If you are God's Son, tell these stones to turn into bread.”"
Matthew,4,4,"Jesus answered, “The Scriptures say: ‘No one can live only on food. People need every word that God has spoken.’ ”"
Matthew,4,5,"Next, the devil took Jesus to the holy city and made him stand on the highest part of the temple."
Matthew,4,6,"The devil said, “If you are God's Son, jump off. The Scriptures say: ‘God will give his angels orders about you. They will catch you in their arms, and you won't hurt your feet on the stones.’ ”"
Matthew,4,7,"Jesus answered, “The Scriptures also say, ‘Don't try to test the Lord your God!’ ”"
Matthew,4,8,"Finally, the devil took Jesus up on a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms on earth and their power."
Matthew,4,9,"The devil said to him, “I will give all this to you, if you will bow down and worship me.”"
Matthew,4,10,"Jesus answered, “Go away Satan! The Scriptures say: ‘Worship the Lord your God and serve only him.’ ”"
Matthew,4,11,"Then the devil left Jesus, and angels came to help him."
Matthew,4,12,"When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he went to Galilee."
Matthew,4,13,"But instead of staying in Nazareth, Jesus moved to Capernaum. This town was beside Lake Galilee in the territory of Zebulun and Naphtali."
Matthew,4,14,"So God's promise came true, just as the prophet Isaiah had said,"
Matthew,4,15,"“Listen, lands of Zebulun and Naphtali, lands along the road to the sea and east of the Jordan! Listen Galilee, land of the Gentiles!"
Matthew,4,16,"Although your people live in darkness, they will see a bright light. Although they live in the shadow of death, a light will shine on them.”"
Matthew,4,17,"Then Jesus started preaching, “Turn back to God! The kingdom of heaven will soon be here.”"
Matthew,4,18,"While Jesus was walking along the shore of Lake Galilee, he saw two brothers. One was Simon, also known as Peter, and the other was Andrew. They were fishermen, and they were casting their net into the lake."
Matthew,4,19,"Jesus said to them, “Come with me! I will teach you how to bring in people instead of fish.”"
Matthew,4,20,At once the two brothers dropped their nets and went with him.
Matthew,4,21,"Jesus walked on until he saw James and John, the sons of Zebedee. They were in a boat with their father, mending their nets. Jesus asked them to come with him too."
Matthew,4,22,Straight away they left the boat and their father and went with Jesus.
Matthew,4,23,"Jesus went all over Galilee, teaching in the Jewish meeting places and preaching the good news about God's kingdom. He also healed every kind of disease and sickness."
Matthew,4,24,"News about him spread all over Syria, and people with every kind of sickness or disease were brought to him. Some of them had a lot of demons in them, others were thought to be mad, and still others could not walk. But Jesus healed them all."
Matthew,4,25,"Large crowds followed Jesus from Galilee and the region around the ten cities known as Decapolis. They also came from Jerusalem, Judea, and from across the River Jordan."
Matthew,5,1,"When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on the side of a mountain and sat down. Jesus' disciples gathered around him,"
Matthew,5,2,and he taught them:
Matthew,5,3,God blesses those people who depend only on him. They belong to the kingdom of heaven!
Matthew,5,4,God blesses those people who grieve. They will find comfort!
Matthew,5,5,God blesses those people who are humble. The earth will belong to them!
Matthew,5,6,God blesses those people who want to obey him more than to eat or drink. They will be given what they want!
Matthew,5,7,God blesses those people who are merciful. They will be treated with mercy!
Matthew,5,8,God blesses those people whose hearts are pure. They will see him!
Matthew,5,9,God blesses those people who make peace. They will be called his children!
Matthew,5,10,God blesses those people who are treated badly for doing right. They belong to the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew,5,11,"God will bless you when people insult you, ill-treat you, and tell all kinds of evil lies about you because of me."
Matthew,5,12,Be happy and excited! You will have a great reward in heaven. People did these same things to the prophets who lived long ago.
Matthew,5,13,"You are like salt for everyone on earth. But if salt no longer tastes like salt, how can it make food salty? All it is good for is to be thrown out and walked on."
Matthew,5,14,"You are like light for the whole world. A city built on top of a hill cannot be hidden,"
Matthew,5,15,"and no one would light a lamp and put it under a clay pot. A lamp is placed on a lampstand, where it can give light to everyone in the house."
Matthew,5,16,"Make your light shine, so that others will see the good that you do and will praise your Father in heaven."
Matthew,5,17,"Don't suppose that I came to do away with the Law and the Prophets. I did not come to do away with them, but to give them their full meaning."
Matthew,5,18,Heaven and earth may disappear. But I promise you that not even a full stop or comma will ever disappear from the Law. Everything written in it must happen.
Matthew,5,19,"If you reject even the least important command in the Law and teach others to do the same, you will be the least important person in the kingdom of heaven. But if you obey and teach others its commands, you will have an important place in the kingdom."
Matthew,5,20,"You must obey God's commands better than the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law obey them. If you don't, I promise you that you will never get into the kingdom of heaven."
Matthew,5,21,"You know that our ancestors were told, “Do not murder” and “A murderer must be brought to trial.”"
Matthew,5,22,"But I promise you that if you are angry with someone, you will have to stand trial. If you call someone a fool, you will be taken to court. And if you say that someone is worthless, you will be in danger of the fires of hell."
Matthew,5,23,"So if you are about to place your gift on the altar and remember that someone is angry with you,"
Matthew,5,24,"leave your gift there in front of the altar. Make peace with that person, then come back and offer your gift to God."
Matthew,5,25,"Before you are dragged into court, make friends with the person who has accused you of doing wrong. If you don't, you will be handed over to the judge and then to the officer who will put you in jail."
Matthew,5,26,I promise you that you will not get out until you have paid the last penny you owe.
Matthew,5,27,"You know the commandment which says, “Be faithful in marriage.”"
Matthew,5,28,"But I tell you that if you look at another woman and want her, you are already unfaithful in your thoughts."
Matthew,5,29,"If your right eye causes you to sin, poke it out and throw it away. It is better to lose one part of your body, than for your whole body to end up in hell."
Matthew,5,30,"If your right hand causes you to sin, chop it off and throw it away! It is better to lose one part of your body, than for your whole body to be thrown into hell."
Matthew,5,31,You have been taught that a man who divorces his wife must write out divorce papers for her.
Matthew,5,32,"But I tell you not to divorce your wife unless she has committed some terrible sexual sin. If you divorce her, you will cause her to be unfaithful, just as any man who marries her is guilty of taking another man's wife."
Matthew,5,33,"You know that our ancestors were told, “Don't use the Lord's name to make a promise unless you are going to keep it.”"
Matthew,5,34,"But I tell you not to swear by anything when you make a promise! Heaven is God's throne, so don't swear by heaven."
Matthew,5,35,"The earth is God's footstool, so don't swear by the earth. Jerusalem is the city of the great king, so don't swear by it."
Matthew,5,36,Don't swear by your own head. You cannot make one hair white or black.
Matthew,5,37,"When you make a promise, say only “Yes” or “No”. Anything else comes from the devil."
Matthew,5,38,"You know that you have been taught, “An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.”"
Matthew,5,39,"But I tell you not to try to get even with a person who has done something to you. When someone slaps your right cheek, turn and let that person slap your other cheek."
Matthew,5,40,"If someone sues you for your shirt, give up your coat as well."
Matthew,5,41,"If a soldier forces you to carry his pack one kilometre, carry it two kilometres."
Matthew,5,42,"When people ask you for something, give it to them. When they want to borrow money, lend it to them."
Matthew,5,43,"You have heard people say, “Love your neighbours and hate your enemies.”"
Matthew,5,44,But I tell you to love your enemies and pray for anyone who ill-treats you.
Matthew,5,45,Then you will be acting like your Father in heaven. He makes the sun rise on both good and bad people. And he sends rain for the ones who do right and for the ones who do wrong.
Matthew,5,46,"If you love only those people who love you, will God reward you for that? Even tax collectors love their friends."
Matthew,5,47,"If you greet only your friends, what's so great about that? Don't even unbelievers do that?"
Matthew,5,48,But you must always act like your Father in heaven.
Matthew,6,1,"When you do good deeds, don't try to show off. If you do, you won't get a reward from your Father in heaven."
Matthew,6,2,"When you give to the poor, don't blow a loud horn. That's what show-offs do in the meeting places and on the street corners, because they are always looking for praise. I can assure you that they already have their reward."
Matthew,6,3,"When you give to the poor, don't let anyone know about it."
Matthew,6,4,"Then your gift will be given in secret. Your Father knows what is done in secret, and he will reward you."
Matthew,6,5,"When you pray, don't be like those show-offs who love to stand up and pray in the meeting places and on the street corners. They do this just to look good. I can assure you that they already have their reward."
Matthew,6,6,"When you pray, go into a room alone and close the door. Pray to your Father in private. He knows what is done in private, and he will reward you."
Matthew,6,7,"When you pray, don't talk on and on as people do who don't know God. They think God likes to hear long prayers."
Matthew,6,8,Don't be like them. Your Father knows what you need before you ask.
Matthew,6,9,"You should pray like this: Our Father in heaven, help us to honour your name."
Matthew,6,10,"Come and set up your kingdom, so that everyone on earth will obey you, as you are obeyed in heaven."
Matthew,6,11,Give us our food for today.
Matthew,6,12,"Forgive us for doing wrong, as we forgive others."
Matthew,6,13,Keep us from being tempted and protect us from evil.
Matthew,6,14,"If you forgive others for the wrongs they do to you, your Father in heaven will forgive you."
Matthew,6,15,"But if you don't forgive others, your Father will not forgive your sins."
Matthew,6,16,"When you go without eating, don't try to look gloomy as those show-offs do when they go without eating. I can assure you that they already have their reward."
Matthew,6,17,"Instead, comb your hair and wash your face."
Matthew,6,18,"Then others won't know that you are going without eating. But your Father sees what is done in private, and he will reward you."
Matthew,6,19,"Don't store up treasures on earth! Moths and rust can destroy them, and thieves can break in and steal them."
Matthew,6,20,"Instead, store up your treasures in heaven, where moths and rust cannot destroy them, and thieves cannot break in and steal them."
Matthew,6,21,Your heart will always be where your treasure is.
Matthew,6,22,"Your eyes are like a window for your body. When they are good, you have all the light you need."
Matthew,6,23,"But when your eyes are bad, everything is dark. If the light inside you is dark, you are in the dark."
Matthew,6,24,You cannot be the slave of two masters! You will like one more than the other or be more loyal to one than the other. You cannot serve both God and money.
Matthew,6,25,"I tell you not to worry about your life. Don't worry about having something to eat, drink, or wear. Isn't life more than food or clothing?"
Matthew,6,26,Look at the birds in the sky! They don't plant or harvest. They don't even store grain in barns. Yet your Father in heaven takes care of them. Aren't you worth more than birds?
Matthew,6,27,Can worry make you live longer?
Matthew,6,28,Why worry about clothes? Look how the wild flowers grow. They don't work hard to make their clothes.
Matthew,6,29,But I tell you that Solomon with all his wealth wasn't as well clothed as one of them.
Matthew,6,30,"God gives such beauty to everything that grows in the fields, even though it is here today and thrown into a fire tomorrow. He will surely do even more for you! Why do you have such little faith?"
Matthew,6,31,"Don't worry and ask yourselves, “Will we have anything to eat? Will we have anything to drink? Will we have any clothes to wear?”"
Matthew,6,32,Only people who don't know God are always worrying about such things. Your Father in heaven knows that you need all these.
Matthew,6,33,"But more than anything else, put God's work first and do what he wants. Then the other things will be yours as well."
Matthew,6,34,Don't worry about tomorrow. It will take care of itself. You have enough to worry about today.
Matthew,7,1,"Don't condemn others, and God won't condemn you."
Matthew,7,2,God will be as hard on you as you are on others! He will treat you exactly as you treat them.
Matthew,7,3,"You can see the speck in your friend's eye, but you don't notice the log in your own eye."
Matthew,7,4,"How can you say, “My friend, let me take the speck out of your eye,” when you don't see the log in your own eye?"
Matthew,7,5,"You're nothing but show-offs! First, take the log out of your own eye. Then you can see how to take the speck out of your friend's eye."
Matthew,7,6,Don't give to dogs what belongs to God. They will only turn and attack you. Don't throw pearls down in front of pigs. They will trample all over them.
Matthew,7,7,"Ask, and you will receive. Search, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened for you."
Matthew,7,8,Everyone who asks will receive. Everyone who searches will find. And the door will be opened for everyone who knocks.
Matthew,7,9,"Would any of you give your hungry child a stone, if the child asked for some bread?"
Matthew,7,10,Would you give your child a snake if the child asked for a fish?
Matthew,7,11,"As bad as you are, you still know how to give good gifts to your children. But your heavenly Father is even more ready to give good things to people who ask."
Matthew,7,12,Treat others as you want them to treat you. This is what the Law and the Prophets are all about.
Matthew,7,13,"Go in through the narrow gate. The gate to destruction is wide, and the road that leads there is easy to follow. A lot of people go through that gate."
Matthew,7,14,But the gate to life is very narrow. The road that leads there is so hard to follow that only a few people find it.
Matthew,7,15,"Watch out for false prophets! They dress up like sheep, but inside they are wolves who have come to attack you."
Matthew,7,16,You can tell what they are by what they do. No one picks grapes or figs from thorn bushes.
Matthew,7,17,"A good tree produces good fruit, and a bad tree produces bad fruit."
Matthew,7,18,"A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot produce good fruit."
Matthew,7,19,Every tree that produces bad fruit will be chopped down and burnt.
Matthew,7,20,You can tell who the false prophets are by their deeds.
Matthew,7,21,Not everyone who calls me their Lord will get into the kingdom of heaven. Only the ones who obey my Father in heaven will get in.
Matthew,7,22,"On the day of judgment many will call me their Lord. They will say, “We preached in your name, and in your name we forced out demons and performed many miracles.”"
Matthew,7,23,"But I will tell them, “I will have nothing to do with you! Get out of my sight, you evil people!”"
Matthew,7,24,Anyone who hears and obeys these teachings of mine is like a wise person who built a house on solid rock.
Matthew,7,25,"Rain poured down, rivers flooded, and winds beat against that house. But it did not fall, because it was built on solid rock."
Matthew,7,26,Anyone who hears my teachings and doesn't obey them is like a foolish person who built a house on sand.
Matthew,7,27,"The rain poured down, the rivers flooded, and the winds blew and beat against that house. Finally, it fell with a crash."
Matthew,7,28,"When Jesus finished speaking, the crowds were surprised at his teaching."
Matthew,7,29,"He taught them like someone with authority, and not like their teachers of the Law of Moses."
Matthew,8,1,"As Jesus came down the mountain, he was followed by large crowds."
Matthew,8,2,"Suddenly a man with leprosy came and knelt in front of Jesus. He said, “Lord, you have the power to make me well, if only you wanted to.”"
Matthew,8,3,"Jesus put his hand on the man and said, “I want to! Now you are well.” At once the man's leprosy disappeared."
Matthew,8,4,"Jesus told him, “Don't tell anyone about this, but go and show the priest that you are well. Then take a gift to the temple just as Moses commanded, and everyone will know that you have been healed.”"
Matthew,8,5,"When Jesus was going into the town of Capernaum, an army officer came up to him and said,"
Matthew,8,6,"“Lord, my servant is at home in such terrible pain that he can't even move.”"
Matthew,8,7,"“I will go and heal him,” Jesus replied."
Matthew,8,8,"But the officer said, “Lord, I'm not good enough for you to come into my house. Just give the order, and my servant will get well."
Matthew,8,9,"I have officers who give orders to me, and I have soldiers who take orders from me. I can say to one of them, ‘Go!’ and he goes. I can say to another, ‘Come!’ and he comes. I can say to my servant, ‘Do this!’ and he will do it.”"
Matthew,8,10,"When Jesus heard this, he was so surprised that he turned and said to the crowd following him, “I tell you that in all of Israel I've never found anyone with this much faith!"
Matthew,8,11,"Many people will come from everywhere to enjoy the feast in the kingdom of heaven with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."
Matthew,8,12,But the ones who should have been in the kingdom will be thrown out into the dark. They will cry and grit their teeth in pain.”
Matthew,8,13,"Then Jesus said to the officer, “You may go home now. Your faith has made it happen.” At once his servant was healed."
Matthew,8,14,"Jesus went to the home of Peter, where he found that Peter's mother-in-law was sick in bed with fever."
Matthew,8,15,"He took her by the hand, and the fever left her. Then she got up and served Jesus a meal."
Matthew,8,16,That evening many people with demons in them were brought to Jesus. And with only a word he forced out the evil spirits and healed everyone who was sick.
Matthew,8,17,"So God's promise came true, just as the prophet Isaiah had said, “He healed our diseases and made us well.”"
Matthew,8,18,"When Jesus saw the crowd, he went across Lake Galilee."
Matthew,8,19,"A teacher of the Law of Moses came up to him and said, “Teacher, I'll go anywhere with you!”"
Matthew,8,20,"Jesus replied, “Foxes have dens, and birds have nests. But the Son of Man doesn't have a place to call his own.”"
Matthew,8,21,"Another disciple said to Jesus, “Lord, let me wait till I bury my father.”"
Matthew,8,22,"Jesus answered, “Come with me, and let the dead bury their dead.”"
Matthew,8,23,"After Jesus left in a boat with his disciples,"
Matthew,8,24,"a terrible storm suddenly struck the lake, and waves started splashing into their boat. Jesus was sound asleep,"
Matthew,8,25,"so the disciples went over to him and woke him up. They said, “Lord, save us! We're going to drown!”"
Matthew,8,26,"But Jesus replied, “Why are you so afraid? You don't have much faith.” Then he got up and ordered the wind and the waves to calm down. And everything was calm."
Matthew,8,27,"The men in the boat were amazed and said, “Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him.”"
Matthew,8,28,"After Jesus had crossed the lake, he came to shore near the town of Gadara and started down the road. Two men with demons in them came to him from the tombs. They were so fierce that no one could travel that way."
Matthew,8,29,"Suddenly they shouted, “Jesus, Son of God, what do you want with us? Have you come to punish us before our time?”"
Matthew,8,30,Not far from there a large herd of pigs was feeding.
Matthew,8,31,"So the demons begged Jesus, “If you force us out, please send us into those pigs!”"
Matthew,8,32,"Jesus told them to go, and they went out of the men and into the pigs. All at once the pigs rushed down the steep bank into the lake and drowned."
Matthew,8,33,"The people taking care of the pigs ran to the town and told everything, especially what had happened to the two men."
Matthew,8,34,"Everyone in town came out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged him to leave their part of the country."
Matthew,9,1,Jesus got into a boat and crossed back over to the town where he lived.
Matthew,9,2,"Some people soon brought to him a crippled man lying on a mat. When Jesus saw how much faith they had, he said to the crippled man, “My friend, don't worry! Your sins are forgiven.”"
Matthew,9,3,"Some teachers of the Law of Moses said to themselves, “Jesus must think he is God!”"
Matthew,9,4,"But Jesus knew what was in their minds, and he said, “Why are you thinking such evil things?"
Matthew,9,5,Is it easier for me to tell this crippled man that his sins are forgiven or to tell him to get up and walk?
Matthew,9,6,"But I will show you that the Son of Man has the right to forgive sins here on earth.” So Jesus said to the man, “Get up! Pick up your mat and go on home.”"
Matthew,9,7,The man got up and went home.
Matthew,9,8,"When the crowds saw this, they were afraid and praised God for giving such authority to people."
Matthew,9,9,"As Jesus was leaving, he saw a tax collector named Matthew sitting at the place for paying taxes. Jesus said to him, “Come with me.” Matthew got up and went with him."
Matthew,9,10,"Later, Jesus and his disciples were having dinner at Matthew's house. Many tax collectors and other sinners were also there."
Matthew,9,11,"Some Pharisees asked Jesus' disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and other sinners?”"
Matthew,9,12,"Jesus heard them and answered, “Healthy people don't need a doctor, but sick people do."
Matthew,9,13,"Go and learn what the Scriptures mean when they say, ‘Instead of offering sacrifices to me, I want you to be merciful to others.’ I didn't come to invite good people to be my followers. I came to invite sinners.”"
Matthew,9,14,"One day some followers of John the Baptist came and asked Jesus, “Why do we and the Pharisees often go without eating, while your disciples never do?”"
Matthew,9,15,Jesus answered: The friends of a bridegroom don't go without eating while he is still with them. But the time will come when he will be taken from them. Then they will go without eating.
Matthew,9,16,No one uses a new piece of cloth to patch old clothes. The patch would shrink and tear a bigger hole.
Matthew,9,17,"No one pours new wine into old wineskins. The wine would swell and burst the old skins. Then the wine would be lost, and the skins would be ruined. New wine must be put into new wineskins. Both the skins and the wine will then be safe."
Matthew,9,18,"While Jesus was still speaking, an official came and knelt in front of him. The man said, “My daughter has just died! Please come and place your hand on her. Then she will live again.”"
Matthew,9,19,Jesus and his disciples got up and went with the man.
Matthew,9,20,A woman who had been bleeding for twelve years came up behind Jesus and barely touched his clothes.
Matthew,9,21,"She had said to herself, “If I can just touch his clothes, I will get well.”"
Matthew,9,22,"Jesus turned. He saw the woman and said, “Don't worry! You are now well because of your faith.” At that moment she was healed."
Matthew,9,23,"When Jesus went into the home of the official and saw the musicians and the crowd of mourners,"
Matthew,9,24,"he said, “Get out of here! The little girl isn't dead. She is just asleep.” Everyone started laughing at Jesus."
Matthew,9,25,"But after the crowd had been sent out of the house, Jesus went to the girl's bedside. He took her by the hand and helped her up."
Matthew,9,26,News about this spread all over that part of the country.
Matthew,9,27,"As Jesus was walking along, two blind men began following him and shouting, “Son of David, have pity on us!”"
Matthew,9,28,"After Jesus had gone indoors, the two blind men came up to him. He asked them, “Do you believe I can make you well?” “Yes, Lord,” they answered."
Matthew,9,29,"Jesus touched their eyes and said, “Because of your faith, you will be healed.”"
Matthew,9,30,"They were able to see, and Jesus strictly warned them not to tell anyone about him."
Matthew,9,31,But they left and talked about him to everyone in that part of the country.
Matthew,9,32,"As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, some people brought to him a man who could not talk because a demon was in him."
Matthew,9,33,"After Jesus had forced the demon out, the man started talking. The crowds were so amazed that they began saying, “Nothing like this has ever happened in Israel!”"
Matthew,9,34,"But the Pharisees said, “The leader of the demons gives him the power to force out demons.”"
Matthew,9,35,Jesus went to every town and village. He taught in their meeting places and preached the good news about God's kingdom. Jesus also healed every kind of disease and sickness.
Matthew,9,36,"When he saw the crowds, he felt sorry for them. They were confused and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd."
Matthew,9,37,"He said to his disciples, “A large crop is in the fields, but there are only a few workers."
Matthew,9,38,Ask the Lord in charge of the harvest to send out workers to bring it in.”
Matthew,10,1,Jesus called together his twelve disciples. He gave them the power to force out evil spirits and to heal every kind of disease and sickness.
Matthew,10,2,"The first of the twelve apostles was Simon, better known as Peter. His brother Andrew was an apostle, and so were James and John, the two sons of Zebedee."
Matthew,10,3,"Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew the tax collector, James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus were also apostles."
Matthew,10,4,"The others were Simon, known as the Eager One, and Judas Iscariot, who later betrayed Jesus."
Matthew,10,5,Jesus sent out the twelve apostles with these instructions: Stay away from the Gentiles and don't go to any Samaritan town.
Matthew,10,6,"Go only to the people of Israel, because they are like a flock of lost sheep."
Matthew,10,7,"As you go, announce that the kingdom of heaven will soon be here."
Matthew,10,8,"Heal the sick, raise the dead to life, heal people who have leprosy, and force out demons. You received without paying, now give without being paid."
Matthew,10,9,"Don't take along any gold, silver, or copper coins."
Matthew,10,10,And don't carry a travelling bag or an extra shirt or sandals or a walking stick. Workers deserve their food.
Matthew,10,11,"So when you go to a town or a village, find someone worthy enough to have you as their guest and stay with them until you leave."
Matthew,10,12,"When you go to a home, give it your blessing of peace."
Matthew,10,13,"If the home is deserving, let your blessing remain with them. But if the home isn't deserving, take back your blessing of peace."
Matthew,10,14,"If someone won't welcome you or listen to your message, leave their home or town. And shake the dust from your feet at them."
Matthew,10,15,I promise you that the day of judgment will be easier for the towns of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town.
Matthew,10,16,I am sending you like lambs into a pack of wolves. So be as wise as snakes and as innocent as doves.
Matthew,10,17,Watch out for people who will take you to court and have you beaten in their meeting places.
Matthew,10,18,"Because of me, you will be dragged before rulers and kings to tell them and the Gentiles about your faith."
Matthew,10,19,"But when someone arrests you, don't worry about what you will say or how you will say it. At that time you will be given the words to say."
Matthew,10,20,But you will not really be the one speaking. The Spirit from your Father will tell you what to say.
Matthew,10,21,"Brothers and sisters will betray one another and have each other put to death. Parents will betray their own children, and children will turn against their parents and have them killed."
Matthew,10,22,"Everyone will hate you because of me. But if you remain faithful until the end, you will be saved."
Matthew,10,23,"When people ill-treat you in one town, hurry to another one. I promise you that before you have gone to all the towns of Israel, the Son of Man will come."
Matthew,10,24,"Disciples are not better than their teacher, and slaves are not better than their master."
Matthew,10,25,"It is enough for disciples to be like their teacher and for slaves to be like their master. If people call the head of the family Satan, what will they say about the rest of the family?"
Matthew,10,26,"Don't be afraid of anyone! Everything that is hidden will be found out, and every secret will be known."
Matthew,10,27,"Whatever I say to you in the dark, you must tell in the light. And you must announce from the housetops whatever I have whispered to you."
Matthew,10,28,"Don't be afraid of people. They can kill you, but they cannot harm your soul. Instead, you should fear God who can destroy both your body and your soul in hell."
Matthew,10,29,Aren't two sparrows sold for only a penny? But your Father knows when any one of them falls to the ground.
Matthew,10,30,Even the hairs on your head are counted.
Matthew,10,31,So don't be afraid! You are worth much more than many sparrows.
Matthew,10,32,"If you tell others that you belong to me, I will tell my Father in heaven that you are my followers."
Matthew,10,33,"But if you reject me, I will tell my Father in heaven that you don't belong to me."
Matthew,10,34,"Don't think that I came to bring peace to the earth! I came to bring trouble, not peace."
Matthew,10,35,"I came to turn sons against their fathers, daughters against their mothers, and daughters-in-law against their mothers-in-law."
Matthew,10,36,Your worst enemies will be in your own family.
Matthew,10,37,"If you love your father or mother or even your sons and daughters more than me, you are not fit to be my disciples."
Matthew,10,38,"And unless you are willing to take up your cross and come with me, you are not fit to be my disciples."
Matthew,10,39,"If you try to save your life, you will lose it. But if you give it up for me, you will find it."
Matthew,10,40,Anyone who welcomes you welcomes me. And anyone who welcomes me also welcomes the one who sent me.
Matthew,10,41,"Anyone who welcomes a prophet, just because that person is a prophet, will be given the same reward as a prophet. Anyone who welcomes a good person, just because that person is good, will be given the same reward as a good person."
Matthew,10,42,"And anyone who gives one of my most humble followers a cup of cool water, just because that person is my follower, will be rewarded."
Matthew,11,1,"After Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he left and began teaching and preaching in the towns."
Matthew,11,2,John was in prison when he heard what Christ was doing. So John sent some of his followers
Matthew,11,3,"to ask Jesus, “Are you the one we should be looking for? Or must we wait for someone else?”"
Matthew,11,4,"Jesus answered, “Go and tell John what you have heard and seen."
Matthew,11,5,"The blind are now able to see, and the lame can walk. People with leprosy are being healed, and the deaf can hear. The dead are raised to life, and the poor are hearing the good news."
Matthew,11,6,God will bless everyone who doesn't reject me because of what I do.”
Matthew,11,7,"As John's followers were going away, Jesus spoke to the crowds about John: What sort of person did you go out into the desert to see? Was he like tall grass blown about by the wind?"
Matthew,11,8,What kind of man did you go out to see? Was he someone dressed in fine clothes? People who dress like that live in the king's palace.
Matthew,11,9,What did you really go out to see? Was he a prophet? He certainly was. I tell you that he was more than a prophet.
Matthew,11,10,"In the Scriptures God says about him, “I am sending my messenger ahead of you to get things ready for you.”"
Matthew,11,11,I tell you that no one ever born on this earth is greater than John the Baptist. But whoever is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than John.
Matthew,11,12,"From the time of John the Baptist until now, violent people have been trying to take over the kingdom of heaven by force."
Matthew,11,13,All the Books of the Prophets and the Law of Moses told what was going to happen up to the time of John.
Matthew,11,14,"And if you believe them, John is Elijah, the prophet you are waiting for."
Matthew,11,15,"If you have ears, pay attention!"
Matthew,11,16,"You people are like children sitting in the market and shouting to each other,"
Matthew,11,17,"“We played the flute, but you would not dance! We sang a funeral song, but you would not mourn!”"
Matthew,11,18,"John the Baptist did not go around eating and drinking, and you said, “That man has a demon in him!”"
Matthew,11,19,"But the Son of Man goes around eating and drinking, and you say, “That man eats and drinks too much! He is even a friend of tax collectors and sinners.” Yet Wisdom is shown to be right by what it does."
Matthew,11,20,"In the towns where Jesus had performed most of his miracles, the people refused to turn to God. So Jesus was upset with them and said:"
Matthew,11,21,"You people of Chorazin are in for trouble! You people of Bethsaida are in for trouble too! If the miracles that took place in your towns had happened in Tyre and Sidon, the people there would have turned to God long ago. They would have dressed in sackcloth and put ashes on their heads."
Matthew,11,22,I tell you that on the day of judgment the people of Tyre and Sidon will get off easier than you will.
Matthew,11,23,"People of Capernaum, do you think you will be honoured in heaven? You will go down to hell! If the miracles that took place in your town had happened in Sodom, that town would still be standing."
Matthew,11,24,So I tell you that on the day of judgment the people of Sodom will get off easier than you.
Matthew,11,25,"At that moment Jesus said: My Father, Lord of heaven and earth, I am grateful that you hid all this from wise and educated people and showed it to ordinary people."
Matthew,11,26,"Yes, Father, that is what pleased you."
Matthew,11,27,"My Father has given me everything, and he is the only one who knows the Son. The only one who truly knows the Father is the Son. But the Son wants to tell others about the Father, so that they can know him too."
Matthew,11,28,"If you are tired from carrying heavy burdens, come to me and I will give you rest."
Matthew,11,29,"Take the yoke I give you. Put it on your shoulders and learn from me. I am gentle and humble, and you will find rest."
Matthew,11,30,"This yoke is easy to bear, and this burden is light."
Matthew,12,1,"One Sabbath, Jesus and his disciples were walking through some wheat fields. His disciples were hungry and began picking and eating grains of wheat."
Matthew,12,2,"Some Pharisees noticed this and said to Jesus, “Why are your disciples picking grain on the Sabbath? They are not supposed to do that!”"
Matthew,12,3,Jesus answered: You must have read what David did when he and his followers were hungry.
Matthew,12,4,"He went into the house of God, and then they ate the sacred loaves of bread that only priests are supposed to eat."
Matthew,12,5,Haven't you read in the Law of Moses that the priests are allowed to work in the temple on the Sabbath? But no one says that they are guilty of breaking the law of the Sabbath.
Matthew,12,6,I tell you that there is something here greater than the temple.
Matthew,12,7,"Don't you know what the Scriptures mean when they say, “Instead of offering sacrifices to me, I want you to be merciful to others”? If you knew what this means, you would not condemn these innocent disciples of mine."
Matthew,12,8,So the Son of Man is Lord over the Sabbath.
Matthew,12,9,"Jesus left and went into one of the Jewish meeting places,"
Matthew,12,10,"where there was a man whose hand was crippled. Some Pharisees wanted to accuse Jesus of doing something wrong, and they asked him, “Is it right to heal someone on the Sabbath?”"
Matthew,12,11,"Jesus answered, “If you had a sheep that fell into a ditch on the Sabbath, wouldn't you lift it out?"
Matthew,12,12,"People are worth much more than sheep, and so it is right to do good on the Sabbath.”"
Matthew,12,13,"Then Jesus told the man, “Hold out your hand.” The man did, and it became as healthy as the other one."
Matthew,12,14,The Pharisees left and started making plans to kill Jesus.
Matthew,12,15,"When Jesus found out what was happening, he left there and large crowds followed him. He healed all their sick,"
Matthew,12,16,but warned them not to tell anyone about him.
Matthew,12,17,"So God's promise came true, just as Isaiah the prophet had said,"
Matthew,12,18,"“Here is my chosen servant! I love him, and he pleases me. I will give him my Spirit, and he will bring justice to the nations."
Matthew,12,19,He won't shout or yell or call out in the streets.
Matthew,12,20,"He won't break off a bent reed or put out a dying flame, but he will make sure that justice is done."
Matthew,12,21,All nations will place their hope in him.”
Matthew,12,22,"Some people brought to Jesus a man who was blind and could not talk because he had a demon in him. Jesus healed the man, and then he was able to talk and see."
Matthew,12,23,"The crowds were so amazed that they asked, “Could Jesus be the Son of David?”"
Matthew,12,24,"When the Pharisees heard this, they said, “He forces out demons by the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons!”"
Matthew,12,25,"Jesus knew what they were thinking, and he said to them: Any kingdom where people fight each other will end up ruined. And a town or family that fights will soon destroy itself."
Matthew,12,26,"So if Satan fights against himself, how can his kingdom last?"
Matthew,12,27,"If I use the power of Beelzebul to force out demons, whose power do your own followers use to force them out? Your followers are the ones who will judge you."
Matthew,12,28,"But when I force out demons by the power of God's Spirit, it proves that God's kingdom has already come to you."
Matthew,12,29,"How can anyone break into a strong man's house and steal his things, unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can take everything."
Matthew,12,30,"If you are not on my side, you are against me. If you don't gather in the harvest with me, you scatter it."
Matthew,13,1,"That same day Jesus left the house and went out beside Lake Galilee, where he sat down to teach."
Matthew,13,2,"Such large crowds gathered around him that he had to sit in a boat, while the people stood on the shore."
Matthew,13,3,Then he taught them many things by using stories. He said: A farmer went out to scatter seed in a field.
Matthew,13,4,"While the farmer was scattering the seed, some of it fell along the road and was eaten by birds."
Matthew,13,5,"Other seeds fell on thin, rocky ground and quickly started growing because the soil wasn't very deep."
Matthew,13,6,"But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched and dried up, because they did not have enough roots."
Matthew,13,7,Some other seeds fell where thorn bushes grew up and choked the plants.
Matthew,13,8,But a few seeds did fall on good ground where the plants produced a hundred or sixty or thirty times as much as was scattered.
Matthew,13,9,"If you have ears, pay attention!"
Matthew,13,10,"Jesus' disciples came to him and asked, “Why do you use nothing but stories when you speak to the people?”"
Matthew,13,11,"Jesus answered: I have explained the secrets about the kingdom of heaven to you, but not to others."
Matthew,13,12,Everyone who has something will be given more. But people who don't have anything will lose even what little they have.
Matthew,13,13,"I use stories when I speak to them because when they look, they cannot see, and when they listen, they cannot hear or understand."
Matthew,13,14,"So God's promise came true, just as the prophet Isaiah had said, “These people will listen and listen, but never understand. They will look and look, but never see."
Matthew,13,15,"All of them have stubborn minds! Their ears are stopped up, and their eyes are covered. They cannot see or hear or understand. If they could, they would turn to me, and I would heal them.”"
Matthew,13,16,"But God has blessed you, because your eyes can see and your ears can hear!"
Matthew,13,17,Many prophets and good people were eager to see what you see and to hear what you hear. But I tell you that they did not see or hear.
Matthew,13,18,Now listen to the meaning of the story about the farmer:
Matthew,13,19,"The seeds that fell along the road are the people who hear the message about the kingdom, but don't understand it. Then the evil one comes and snatches the message from their hearts."
Matthew,13,20,The seeds that fell on rocky ground are the people who gladly hear the message and accept it straight away.
Matthew,13,21,"But they don't have deep roots, and they don't last very long. As soon as life gets hard or the message gets them in trouble, they give up."
Matthew,13,22,"The seeds that fell among the thorn bushes are also people who hear the message. But they start worrying about the needs of this life and are fooled by the desire to get rich. So the message gets choked out, and they never produce anything."
Matthew,13,23,The seeds that fell on good ground are the people who hear and understand the message. They produce as much as a hundred or sixty or thirty times what was planted.
Matthew,13,24,Jesus then told them this story: The kingdom of heaven is like what happened when a farmer scattered good seed in a field.
Matthew,13,25,"But while everyone was sleeping, an enemy came and scattered weeds in the field and then left."
Matthew,13,26,"When the plants came up and began to ripen, the farmer's servants could see the weeds."
Matthew,13,27,"The servants came and asked, “Sir, didn't you scatter good seed in your field? Where did these weeds come from?”"
Matthew,13,28,"“An enemy did this,” he replied. His servants then asked, “Do you want us to go out and pull up the weeds?”"
Matthew,13,29,“No!” he answered. “You might also pull up the wheat.
Matthew,13,30,Leave the weeds alone until harvest time. Then I'll tell my workers to gather the weeds and tie them up and burn them. But I'll order them to store the wheat in my barn.”
Matthew,13,31,Jesus told them another story: The kingdom of heaven is like what happens when a farmer plants a mustard seed in a field.
Matthew,13,32,"Although it is the smallest of all seeds, it grows larger than any garden plant and becomes a tree. Birds even come and nest on its branches."
Matthew,13,33,"Jesus also said: The kingdom of heaven is like what happens when a woman mixes a little yeast into three big batches of flour. Finally, all the dough rises."
Matthew,13,34,"Jesus used stories when he spoke to the people. In fact, he did not tell them anything without using stories."
Matthew,13,35,"So God's promise came true, just as the prophet had said, “I will use stories to speak my message and to explain things that have been hidden since the creation of the world.”"
Matthew,13,36,"After Jesus left the crowd and went inside, his disciples came to him and said, “Explain to us the story about the weeds in the wheat field.”"
Matthew,13,37,Jesus answered: The one who scattered the good seed is the Son of Man.
Matthew,13,38,"The field is the world, and the good seeds are the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are those who belong to the evil one,"
Matthew,13,39,"and the one who scattered them is the devil. The harvest is the end of time, and angels are the ones who bring in the harvest."
Matthew,13,40,Weeds are gathered and burnt. That's how it will be at the end of time.
Matthew,13,41,"The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will gather from his kingdom everyone who does wrong or causes others to sin."
Matthew,13,42,"Then he will throw them into a flaming furnace, where people will cry and grit their teeth in pain."
Matthew,13,43,"But everyone who has done right will shine like the sun in their Father's kingdom. If you have ears, pay attention!"
Matthew,13,44,The kingdom of heaven is like what happens when someone finds treasure hidden in a field and buries it again. A person like that is happy and goes and sells everything in order to buy that field.
Matthew,13,45,The kingdom of heaven is like what happens when a shop owner is looking for fine pearls.
Matthew,13,46,"After finding a very valuable one, the owner goes and sells everything in order to buy that pearl."
Matthew,13,47,The kingdom of heaven is like what happens when a net is thrown into a lake and catches all kinds of fish.
Matthew,13,48,"When the net is full, it is dragged to the shore, and the fishermen sit down to separate the fish. They keep the good ones, but throw the bad ones away."
Matthew,13,49,That's how it will be at the end of time. Angels will come and separate the evil people from the ones who have done right.
Matthew,13,50,"Then those evil people will be thrown into a flaming furnace, where they will cry and grit their teeth in pain."
Matthew,13,51,"Jesus asked his disciples if they understood all these things. They said, “Yes, we do.”"
Matthew,13,52,"So he told them, “Every student of the Scriptures who becomes a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like someone who brings out new and old treasures from the storeroom.”"
Matthew,13,53,"When Jesus had finished telling these stories, he left"
Matthew,13,54,"and went to his home town. He taught in their meeting place, and the people were so amazed that they asked, “Where does he get all this wisdom and the power to perform these miracles?"
Matthew,13,55,"Isn't he the son of the carpenter? Isn't Mary his mother, and aren't James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas his brothers?"
Matthew,13,56,Don't his sisters still live here in our town? How can he do all this?”
Matthew,13,57,"So the people were very unhappy because of what he was doing. But Jesus said, “Prophets are honoured by everyone, except the people of their home town and their own family.”"
Matthew,13,58,"And because the people did not have any faith, Jesus did not perform many miracles there."
Matthew,14,1,About this time Herod the ruler heard the news about Jesus
Matthew,14,2,"and told his officials, “This is John the Baptist! He has come back from death, and that's why he has the power to perform these miracles.”"
Matthew,15,1,"About this time some Pharisees and teachers of the Law of Moses came from Jerusalem. They asked Jesus,"
Matthew,15,2,“Why don't your disciples obey what our ancestors taught us to do? They don't even wash their hands before they eat.”
Matthew,15,3,Jesus answered: Why do you disobey God and follow your own teaching?
Matthew,15,4,Didn't God command you to respect your father and mother? Didn't he tell you to put to death all who curse their parents?
Matthew,15,5,But you let people get by without helping their parents when they should. You let them say that what they have has been offered to God.
Matthew,15,6,Is this any way to show respect to your parents? You ignore God's commands in order to follow your own teaching.
Matthew,15,7,"And you are nothing but show-offs! Isaiah the prophet was right when he wrote that God had said,"
Matthew,15,8,"“All of you praise me with your words, but you never really think about me."
Matthew,15,9,"It is useless for you to worship me, when you teach rules made up by humans.”"
Matthew,15,10,"Jesus called the crowd together and said, “Pay attention and try to understand what I mean."
Matthew,15,11,The food that you put into your mouth doesn't make you unclean and unfit to worship God. The bad words that come out of your mouth are what make you unclean.”
Matthew,15,12,"Then his disciples came over to him and asked, “Do you know that you insulted the Pharisees by what you said?”"
Matthew,15,13,"Jesus answered, “Every plant that my Father in heaven did not plant will be pulled up by the roots."
Matthew,15,14,"Stay away from those Pharisees! They are like blind people leading other blind people, and all of them will fall into a ditch.”"
Matthew,15,15,"Peter replied, “What did you mean when you talked about the things that make people unclean?”"
Matthew,15,16,Jesus then said: Don't any of you know what I am talking about by now?
Matthew,15,17,Don't you know that the food you put into your mouth goes into your stomach and then out of your body?
Matthew,15,18,But the words that come out of your mouth come from your heart. And they are what make you unfit to worship God.
Matthew,15,19,"Out of your heart come evil thoughts, murder, unfaithfulness in marriage, vulgar deeds, stealing, telling lies, and insulting others."
Matthew,15,20,These are what make you unclean. Eating without washing your hands will not make you unfit to worship God.
Matthew,15,21,Jesus left and went to the territory near the cities of Tyre and Sidon.
Matthew,15,22,"Suddenly a Canaanite woman from there came out shouting, “Lord and Son of David, have pity on me! My daughter is full of demons.”"
Matthew,15,23,"Jesus did not say a word. But the woman kept following along and shouting, so his disciples came up and asked him to send her away."
Matthew,15,24,"Jesus said, “I was sent only to the people of Israel! They are like a flock of lost sheep.”"
Matthew,15,25,"The woman came closer. Then she knelt down and begged, “Please help me, Lord!”"
Matthew,15,26,"Jesus replied, “It isn't right to take food away from children and feed it to dogs.”"
Matthew,15,27,"“Lord, that's true,” the woman said, “but even dogs get the crumbs that fall from their owner's table.”"
Matthew,15,28,"Jesus answered, “Dear woman, you really do have a lot of faith, and you will be given what you want.” At that moment her daughter was healed."
Matthew,15,29,"From there, Jesus went along Lake Galilee. Then he climbed a hill and sat down."
Matthew,15,30,"Large crowds came and brought many people who were crippled or blind or lame or unable to talk. They placed them, and many others, in front of Jesus, and he healed them all."
Matthew,15,31,"Everyone was amazed at what they saw and heard. People who had never spoken could now speak. The lame were healed, the crippled could walk, and the blind were able to see. Everyone was praising the God of Israel."
Matthew,15,32,"Jesus called his disciples together and told them, “I feel sorry for these people. They have been with me for three days, and they don't have anything to eat. I don't want to send them away hungry. They might faint on their way home.”"
Matthew,15,33,"His disciples said, “This place is like a desert. Where can we find enough food to feed such a crowd?”"
Matthew,15,34,"Jesus asked them how much food they had. They replied, “Seven small loaves of bread and a few little fish.”"
Matthew,15,35,"After Jesus had told the people to sit down,"
Matthew,15,36,"he took the seven loaves of bread and the fish and gave thanks. He then broke them and handed them to his disciples, who passed them around to the crowds."
Matthew,15,37,"Everyone ate all they wanted, and the leftovers filled seven large baskets."
Matthew,15,38,"There were four thousand men who ate, not counting the women and children."
Matthew,15,39,"After Jesus had sent the crowds away, he got into a boat and sailed across the lake. He came to shore near the town of Magadan."
Matthew,16,1,The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus and tried to test him by asking for a sign from heaven.
Matthew,16,2,"He told them: If the sky is red in the evening, you say the weather will be good."
Matthew,16,3,"But if the sky is red and gloomy in the morning, you say it is going to rain. You can tell what the weather will be like by looking at the sky. But you don't understand what is happening now."
Matthew,16,4,You want a sign because you are evil and won't believe! But the only sign you will be given is what happened to Jonah. Then Jesus left.
Matthew,16,5,The disciples had forgotten to bring any bread when they crossed the lake.
Matthew,16,6,"Jesus then warned them, “Watch out! Guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”"
Matthew,16,7,"The disciples talked this over and said to each other, “He must be saying this because we didn't bring along any bread.”"
Matthew,16,8,Jesus knew what they were thinking and said: You don't have much faith! Why are you talking about not having any bread?
Matthew,16,9,Don't you understand? Have you forgotten about the five thousand people and all those baskets of leftovers from just five loaves of bread?
Matthew,16,10,And what about the four thousand people and all those baskets of leftovers from only seven loaves of bread?
Matthew,16,11,Don't you know by now that I am not talking to you about bread? Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!
Matthew,16,12,"Finally, the disciples understood that Jesus wasn't talking about the yeast used to make bread, but about the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
Matthew,16,13,"When Jesus and his disciples were near the town of Caesarea Philippi, he asked them, “What do people say about the Son of Man?”"
Matthew,16,14,"The disciples answered, “Some people say you are John the Baptist or perhaps Elijah or Jeremiah or some other prophet.”"
Matthew,16,15,"Then Jesus asked them, “But who do you say I am?”"
Matthew,16,16,"Simon Peter spoke up, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.”"
Matthew,16,17,"Jesus told him: Simon, son of Jonah, you are blessed! You didn't discover this on your own. It was shown to you by my Father in heaven."
Matthew,16,18,"So I will call you Peter, which means “a rock”. On this rock I will build my church, and death itself will not have any power over it."
Matthew,16,19,"I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven, and God in heaven will allow whatever you allow on earth. But he will not allow anything that you don't allow."
Matthew,16,20,Jesus told his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah.
Matthew,16,21,"From then on, Jesus began telling his disciples what would happen to him. He said, “I must go to Jerusalem. There the nation's leaders, the chief priests, and the teachers of the Law of Moses will make me suffer terribly. I will be killed, but three days later I will rise to life.”"
Matthew,16,22,"Peter took Jesus aside and told him to stop talking like that. He said, “God would never let this happen to you, Lord!”"
Matthew,16,23,"Jesus turned to Peter and said, “Satan, get away from me! You're in my way because you think like everyone else and not like God.”"
Matthew,16,24,"Then Jesus said to his disciples: If any of you want to be my followers, you must forget about yourself. You must take up your cross and follow me."
Matthew,16,25,"If you want to save your life, you will destroy it. But if you give up your life for me, you will find it."
Matthew,16,26,"What will you gain, if you own the whole world but destroy yourself? What would you give to get back your soul?"
Matthew,16,27,The Son of Man will soon come in the glory of his Father and with his angels to reward all people for what they have done.
Matthew,16,28,I promise you that some of those standing here will not die before they see the Son of Man coming with his kingdom.
Matthew,17,1,Six days later Jesus took Peter and the brothers James and John with him. They went up on a very high mountain where they could be alone.
Matthew,17,2,"There in front of the disciples, Jesus was completely changed. His face was shining like the sun, and his clothes became white as light."
Matthew,17,3,All at once Moses and Elijah were there talking with Jesus.
Matthew,17,4,"So Peter said to him, “Lord, it is good for us to be here! Let us make three shelters, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”"
Matthew,17,5,"While Peter was still speaking, the shadow of a bright cloud passed over them. From the cloud a voice said, “This is my own dear Son, and I am pleased with him. Listen to what he says!”"
Matthew,17,6,"When the disciples heard the voice, they were so afraid that they fell flat on the ground."
Matthew,17,7,"But Jesus came over and touched them. He said, “Get up and don't be afraid!”"
Matthew,17,8,"When they opened their eyes, they saw only Jesus."
Matthew,17,9,"On their way down from the mountain, Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone what they had seen until after the Son of Man had been raised from death."
Matthew,17,10,"The disciples asked Jesus, “Don't the teachers of the Law of Moses say that Elijah must come before the Messiah does?”"
Matthew,17,11,"Jesus told them, “Elijah certainly will come and get everything ready."
Matthew,17,12,"In fact, he has already come. But the people did not recognize him and treated him just as they wanted to. They will soon make the Son of Man suffer in the same way.”"
Matthew,17,13,Then the disciples understood that Jesus was talking to them about John the Baptist.
Matthew,17,14,Jesus and his disciples returned to the crowd. A man knelt in front of him
Matthew,17,15,"and said, “Lord, have pity on my son! He has a bad case of epilepsy and often falls into a fire or into water."
Matthew,17,16,"I brought him to your disciples, but none of them could heal him.”"
Matthew,17,17,"Jesus said, “You people are too stubborn to have any faith! How much longer must I be with you? Why do I have to put up with you? Bring the boy here.”"
Matthew,17,18,"Then Jesus spoke sternly to the demon. It went out of the boy, and at once he was healed."
Matthew,17,19,"Later the disciples went to Jesus in private and asked him, “Why couldn't we force out the demon?”"
Matthew,18,1,About this time the disciples came to Jesus and asked him who would be the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew,18,2,Jesus called a child over and made the child stand near him.
Matthew,18,3,"Then he said: I promise you this. If you don't change and become like a child, you will never get into the kingdom of heaven."
Matthew,18,4,"But if you are as humble as this child, you are the greatest in the kingdom of heaven."
Matthew,18,5,"And when you welcome one of these children because of me, you welcome me."
Matthew,18,6,It will be terrible for people who cause even one of my little followers to sin. Those people would be better off thrown into the deepest part of the sea with a heavy stone tied around their necks!
Matthew,18,7,"The world is in for trouble because of the way it causes people to sin. There will always be something to cause people to sin, but anyone who does this will be in for trouble."
Matthew,18,8,"If your hand or foot causes you to sin, chop it off and throw it away! You would be better off to go into life crippled or lame than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into the fire that never goes out."
Matthew,18,9,"If your eye causes you to sin, poke it out and get rid of it. You would be better off to go into life with only one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fires of hell."
Matthew,19,1,"When Jesus finished teaching, he left Galilee and went to the part of Judea that is east of the River Jordan."
Matthew,19,2,"Large crowds followed him, and he healed their sick people."
Matthew,19,3,"Some Pharisees wanted to test Jesus. They came up to him and asked, “Is it right for a man to divorce his wife for just any reason?”"
Matthew,19,4,"Jesus answered, “Don't you know that in the beginning the Creator made a man and a woman?"
Matthew,19,5,That's why a man leaves his father and mother and gets married. He becomes like one person with his wife.
Matthew,19,6,"Then they are no longer two people, but one. And no one should separate a couple that God has joined together.”"
Matthew,19,7,"The Pharisees asked Jesus, “Why did Moses say that a man could write out divorce papers and send his wife away?”"
Matthew,19,8,"Jesus replied, “You are so heartless! That's why Moses allowed you to divorce your wife. But from the beginning God did not intend it to be that way."
Matthew,19,9,"I say that if your wife has not committed some terrible sexual sin, you must not divorce her to marry someone else. If you do, you are unfaithful.”"
Matthew,19,10,"The disciples said, “If that's how it is between a man and a woman, it's better not to get married.”"
Matthew,19,11,"Jesus told them, “Only those people who have been given the gift of staying single can accept this teaching."
Matthew,19,12,Some people are unable to marry because of birth defects or because of what someone has done to their bodies. Others stay single for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Anyone who can accept this teaching should do so.”
Matthew,19,13,"Some people brought their children to Jesus, so that he could place his hands on them and pray for them. His disciples told the people to stop bothering him."
Matthew,19,14,"But Jesus said, “Let the children come to me, and don't try to stop them! People who are like these children belong to God's kingdom.”"
Matthew,19,15,"After Jesus had placed his hands on the children, he left."
Matthew,19,16,"A man came to Jesus and asked, “Teacher, what good thing must I do to have eternal life?”"
Matthew,19,17,"Jesus said to him, “Why do you ask me about what is good? Only God is good. If you want to have eternal life, you must obey his commandments.”"
Matthew,19,18,"“Which ones?” the man asked. Jesus answered, “Do not murder. Be faithful in marriage. Do not steal. Do not tell lies about others."
Matthew,19,19,Respect your father and mother. And love others as much as you love yourself.”
Matthew,19,20,"The young man said, “I have obeyed all these. What else must I do?”"
Matthew,19,21,"Jesus replied, “If you want to be perfect, go and sell everything you own! Give the money to the poor, and you will have riches in heaven. Then come and be my follower.”"
Matthew,19,22,"When the young man heard this, he was sad, because he was very rich."
Matthew,19,23,"Jesus said to his disciples, “It's terribly hard for rich people to get into the kingdom of heaven!"
Matthew,19,24,"In fact, it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to get into God's kingdom.”"
Matthew,19,25,"When the disciples heard this, they were greatly surprised and asked, “How can anyone ever be saved?”"
Matthew,19,26,"Jesus looked straight at them and said, “There are some things that people cannot do, but God can do anything.”"
Matthew,19,27,"Peter replied, “Remember, we have left everything to be your followers! What will we get?”"
Matthew,19,28,"Jesus answered: Yes, all of you have become my followers. And so in the future world, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, I promise that you will sit on twelve thrones to judge the twelve tribes of Israel."
Matthew,19,29,All who have given up home or brothers and sisters or father and mother or children or land for me will be given a hundred times as much. They will also have eternal life.
Matthew,19,30,"But many who are now first will be last, and many who are last will be first."
Matthew,20,1,"As Jesus was telling what the kingdom of heaven would be like, he said: Early one morning a man went out to hire some workers for his vineyard."
Matthew,20,2,"After he had agreed to pay them the usual amount for a day's work, he sent them off to his vineyard."
Matthew,20,3,"About nine that morning, the man saw some other people standing in the market with nothing to do."
Matthew,20,4,"He said he would pay them what was fair, if they would work in his vineyard."
Matthew,20,5,So they went. At midday and again about three in the afternoon he returned to the market. And each time he made the same agreement with others who were lazing around with nothing to do.
Matthew,20,6,"Finally, about five in the afternoon the man went back and found some others standing there. He asked them, “Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing?”"
Matthew,20,7,"“Because no one has hired us,” they answered. Then he told them to go and work in his vineyard."
Matthew,20,8,That evening the owner of the vineyard told the man in charge of the workers to call them in and give them their money. He also told the man to begin with the ones who were hired last.
Matthew,20,9,"When the workers arrived, the ones who had been hired at five in the afternoon were given a full day's pay."
Matthew,20,10,"The workers who had been hired first thought they would be given more than the others. But when they were given the same,"
Matthew,20,11,they began complaining to the owner of the vineyard.
Matthew,20,12,"They said, “The ones who were hired last worked for only one hour. But you paid them the same that you did us. And we worked in the hot sun all day long!”"
Matthew,20,13,"The owner answered one of them, “Friend, I didn't cheat you. I paid you exactly what we agreed on."
Matthew,20,14,Take your money now and go! What business is it of yours if I want to pay them the same that I paid you?
Matthew,20,15,"Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Why should you be jealous, if I want to be generous?”"
Matthew,20,16,"Jesus then said, “So it is. Everyone who is now first will be last, and everyone who is last will be first.”"
Matthew,20,17,"As Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem, he took his twelve disciples aside and told them in private:"
Matthew,20,18,"We are now on our way to Jerusalem, where the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the Law of Moses. They will sentence him to death,"
Matthew,20,19,and then they will hand him over to foreigners who will make fun of him. They will beat him and nail him to a cross. But on the third day he will rise from death.
Matthew,20,20,The mother of James and John came to Jesus with her two sons. She knelt down and started begging him to do something for her.
Matthew,20,21,"Jesus asked her what she wanted, and she said, “When you come into your kingdom, please let one of my sons sit at your right side and the other at your left.”"
Matthew,20,22,"Jesus answered, “Not one of you knows what you are asking. Are you able to drink from the cup that I must soon drink from?” James and John said, “Yes, we are!”"
Matthew,20,23,"Jesus replied, “You certainly will drink from my cup! But it isn't for me to say who will sit at my right side and at my left. That is for my Father to say.”"
Matthew,20,24,"When the ten other disciples heard this, they were angry with the two brothers."
Matthew,20,25,But Jesus called the disciples together and said: You know that foreign rulers like to order their people around. And their great leaders have full power over everyone they rule.
Matthew,20,26,"But don't act like them. If you want to be great, you must be the servant of all the others."
Matthew,20,27,"And if you want to be first, you must be the slave of the rest."
Matthew,20,28,"The Son of Man did not come to be a slave master, but a slave who will give his life to rescue many people."
Matthew,20,29,Jesus was followed by a large crowd as he and his disciples were leaving Jericho.
Matthew,20,30,"Two blind men were sitting beside the road. And when they heard that Jesus was coming their way, they shouted, “Lord and Son of David, have pity on us!”"
Matthew,20,31,"The crowd told them to be quiet, but they shouted even louder, “Lord and Son of David, have pity on us!”"
Matthew,20,32,"When Jesus heard them, he stopped and asked, “What do you want me to do for you?”"
Matthew,20,33,"They answered, “Lord, we want to see!”"
Matthew,20,34,"Jesus felt sorry for them and touched their eyes. Straight away they could see, and they became his followers."
Matthew,21,1,"When Jesus and his disciples came near Jerusalem, he went to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives and sent two of them on ahead."
Matthew,21,2,"He told them, “Go into the next village, where you will at once find a donkey and her colt. Untie the two donkeys and bring them to me."
Matthew,21,3,"If anyone asks why you are doing that, just say, ‘The Lord needs them.’ Straight away he will let you have the donkeys.”"
Matthew,21,4,"So God's promise came true, just as the prophet had said,"
Matthew,21,5,“Announce to the people of Jerusalem: ‘Your king is coming to you! He is humble and rides on a donkey. He comes on the colt of a donkey.’ ”
Matthew,21,6,The disciples left and did what Jesus had told them to do.
Matthew,21,7,They brought the donkey and its colt and laid some clothes on their backs. Then Jesus got on.
Matthew,21,8,"Many people spread clothes in the road, while others put down branches which they had cut from trees."
Matthew,21,9,"Some people walked ahead of Jesus and others followed behind. They were all shouting, “Hooray for the Son of David! God bless the one who comes in the name of the Lord. Hooray for God in heaven above!”"
Matthew,21,10,"When Jesus came to Jerusalem, everyone in the city was excited and asked, “Who can this be?”"
Matthew,21,11,"The crowd answered, “This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.”"
Matthew,21,12,Jesus went into the temple and chased out everyone who was selling or buying. He turned over the tables of the moneychangers and the benches of the ones who were selling doves.
Matthew,21,13,"He told them, “The Scriptures say, ‘My house should be called a place of worship.’ But you have turned it into a place where robbers hide.”"
Matthew,21,14,"Blind and lame people came to Jesus in the temple, and he healed them."
Matthew,21,15,But the chief priests and the teachers of the Law of Moses were angry when they saw his miracles and heard the children shouting praises to the Son of David.
Matthew,21,16,"The men said to Jesus, “Don't you hear what those children are saying?” “Yes, I do!” Jesus answered. “Don't you know that the Scriptures say, ‘Children and infants will sing praises’?”"
Matthew,21,17,"Then Jesus left the city and went out to the village of Bethany, where he spent the night."
Matthew,21,18,"When Jesus got up the next morning, he was hungry. He started out for the city,"
Matthew,21,19,"and along the way he saw a fig tree. But when he came to it, he found only leaves and no figs. So he told the tree, “You will never again grow any fruit!” At once the fig tree dried up."
Matthew,21,20,The disciples were shocked when they saw how quickly the tree had dried up.
Matthew,21,21,"But Jesus said to them, “If you have faith and don't doubt, I promise that you can do what I did to this tree. And you will be able to do even more. You can tell this mountain to get up and jump into the sea, and it will."
Matthew,21,22,"If you have faith when you pray, you will be given whatever you ask for.”"
Matthew,21,23,"Jesus had gone into the temple and was teaching when the chief priests and the leaders of the people came up to him. They asked, “What right do you have to do these things? Who gave you this authority?”"
Matthew,21,24,"Jesus answered, “I have just one question to ask you. If you answer it, I will tell you where I got the right to do these things."
Matthew,21,25,"Who gave John the right to baptize? Was it God in heaven or merely some human being?” They thought it over and said to each other, “We can't say that God gave John this right. Jesus will ask us why we didn't believe John."
Matthew,21,26,"On the other hand, these people think that John was a prophet, and we are afraid of what they might do to us. That's why we can't say that it was merely some human who gave John the right to baptize.”"
Matthew,21,27,"So they told Jesus, “We don't know.” Jesus said, “Then I won't tell you who gave me the right to do what I do.”"
Matthew,21,28,"Jesus said: I will tell you a story about a man who had two sons. Then you can tell me what you think. The father went to the elder son and said, “Go and work in the vineyard today!”"
Matthew,21,29,"His son told him that he would not do it, but later he changed his mind and went."
Matthew,21,30,"The man then told his younger son to go and work in the vineyard. The boy said he would, but he didn't go."
Matthew,21,31,"Which one of the sons obeyed his father? “The elder one,” the chief priests and leaders answered. Then Jesus told them: You can be sure that tax collectors and prostitutes will get into the kingdom of God before you ever will!"
Matthew,21,32,"When John the Baptist showed you how to do right, you would not believe him. But these evil people did believe. And even when you saw what they did, you still would not change your minds and believe."
Matthew,21,33,Jesus told the chief priests and leaders to listen to this story: A land owner once planted a vineyard. He built a wall around it and dug a pit to crush the grapes in. He also built a lookout tower. Then he let his vineyard and left the country.
Matthew,21,34,"When it was harvest time, the owner sent some servants to get his share of the grapes."
Matthew,21,35,"But the tenants grabbed those servants. They beat up one, killed one, and stoned one of them to death."
Matthew,21,36,He then sent more servants than he did the first time. But the tenants treated them in the same way.
Matthew,21,37,"Finally, the owner sent his own son to the tenants, because he thought they would respect him."
Matthew,21,38,"But when they saw the man's son, they said, “Some day he will own the vineyard. Let's kill him! Then we can have it all for ourselves.”"
Matthew,21,39,"So they grabbed him, threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him."
Matthew,21,40,"Jesus asked, “When the owner of that vineyard comes, what do you suppose he will do to those tenants?”"
Matthew,21,41,"The chief priests and leaders answered, “He will kill them in some horrible way. Then he will let his vineyard to people who will give him his share of grapes at harvest time.”"
Matthew,21,42,"Jesus replied, “Surely you know that the Scriptures say, ‘The stone that the builders tossed aside is now the most important stone of all. This is something the Lord has done, and it is amazing to us.’"
Matthew,21,43,I tell you that God's kingdom will be taken from you and given to people who will do what he demands.
Matthew,21,44,"Anyone who stumbles over this stone will be crushed, and anyone it falls on will be smashed to pieces.”"
Matthew,21,45,"When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard these stories, they knew that Jesus was talking about them."
Matthew,21,46,"So they looked for a way to arrest Jesus. But they were afraid to, because the people thought he was a prophet."
Matthew,22,1,Once again Jesus used stories to teach the people:
Matthew,22,2,The kingdom of heaven is like what happened when a king gave a wedding banquet for his son.
Matthew,22,3,"The king sent some servants to tell the invited guests to come to the banquet, but the guests refused."
Matthew,22,4,"He sent other servants to say to the guests, “The banquet is ready! My cattle and prize calves have all been prepared. Everything is ready. Come to the banquet!”"
Matthew,22,5,"But the guests did not pay any attention. Some of them left for their farms, and some went to their places of business."
Matthew,22,6,"Others grabbed the servants, then beat them up and killed them."
Matthew,22,7,This made the king so furious that he sent an army to kill those murderers and burn down their city.
Matthew,22,8,"Then he said to the servants, “It is time for the wedding banquet, and the invited guests don't deserve to come."
Matthew,22,9,Go out to the street corners and tell everyone you meet to come to the banquet.”
Matthew,22,10,"They went out into the streets and brought in everyone they could find, good and bad alike. And the banquet room was filled with guests."
Matthew,22,11,"When the king went in to meet the guests, he found that one of them wasn't wearing the right kind of clothes for the wedding."
Matthew,22,12,"The king asked, “Friend, why didn't you wear proper clothes for the wedding?” But the guest had no excuse."
Matthew,22,13,So the king gave orders for that person to be tied hand and foot and to be thrown outside into the dark. That's where people will cry and grit their teeth in pain.
Matthew,22,14,"Many are invited, but only a few are chosen."
Matthew,22,15,The Pharisees got together and planned how they could trick Jesus into saying something wrong.
Matthew,22,16,"They sent some of their followers and some of Herod's followers to say to him, “Teacher, we know that you are honest. You teach the truth about what God wants people to do. And you treat everyone with the same respect, no matter who they are."
Matthew,22,17,Tell us what you think! Should we pay taxes to the Emperor or not?”
Matthew,22,18,"Jesus knew their evil thoughts and said, “Why are you trying to test me? You show-offs!"
Matthew,22,19,"Let me see one of the coins used for paying taxes.” They brought him a silver coin,"
Matthew,22,20,"and he asked, “Whose picture and name are on it?”"
Matthew,22,21,"“The Emperor's,” they answered. Then Jesus told them, “Give the Emperor what belongs to him and give God what belongs to God.”"
Matthew,22,22,His answer surprised them so much that they walked away.
Matthew,22,23,The Sadducees did not believe that people would rise to life after death. So that same day some of the Sadducees came to Jesus and said:
Matthew,22,24,"Teacher, Moses wrote that if a married man dies and has no children, his brother should marry the widow. Their first son would then be thought of as the son of the dead brother."
Matthew,22,25,"Once there were seven brothers who lived here. The first one married, but died without having any children. So his wife was left to his brother."
Matthew,22,26,The same thing happened to the second and third brothers and finally to all seven of them.
Matthew,22,27,At last the woman died.
Matthew,22,28,"When God raises people from death, whose wife will this woman be? She had been married to all seven brothers."
Matthew,22,29,Jesus answered: You are completely wrong! You don't know what the Scriptures teach. And you don't know anything about the power of God.
Matthew,22,30,"When God raises people to life, they won't marry. They will be like the angels in heaven."
Matthew,22,31,"And as for people being raised to life, God was speaking to you when he said,"
Matthew,22,32,"“I am the God worshipped by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.” He isn't the God of the dead, but of the living."
Matthew,22,33,The crowds were surprised to hear what Jesus was teaching.
Matthew,22,34,"After Jesus had made the Sadducees look foolish, the Pharisees heard about it and got together."
Matthew,22,35,"One of them was an expert in the Jewish Law. So he tried to test Jesus by asking,"
Matthew,22,36,"“Teacher, what is the most important commandment in the Law?”"
Matthew,22,37,"Jesus answered: Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, and mind."
Matthew,22,38,This is the first and most important commandment.
Matthew,22,39,"The second most important commandment is like this one. And it is, “Love others as much as you love yourself.”"
Matthew,22,40,All the Law of Moses and the Books of the Prophets are based on these two commandments.
Matthew,22,41,"While the Pharisees were still there, Jesus asked them,"
Matthew,22,42,"“What do you think about the Messiah? Whose family will he come from?” They answered, “He will be a son of King David.”"
Matthew,22,43,"Jesus replied, “How then could the Spirit lead David to call the Messiah his Lord? David said,"
Matthew,22,44,‘The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at my right side until I make your enemies into a footstool for you.’
Matthew,22,45,"If David called the Messiah his Lord, how can the Messiah be a son of King David?”"
Matthew,22,46,"No one was able to give Jesus an answer, and from that day on, no one dared ask him any more questions."
Matthew,23,1,Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples:
Matthew,23,2,The Pharisees and the teachers of the Law are experts in the Law of Moses.
Matthew,23,3,"So obey everything they teach you, but don't do as they do. After all, they say one thing and do something else."
Matthew,23,4,They pile heavy burdens on people's shoulders and won't lift a finger to help.
Matthew,23,5,"Everything they do is just to show off in front of others. They even make a big show of wearing Scripture verses on their foreheads and arms, and they wear big tassels for everyone to see."
Matthew,23,6,They love the best seats at banquets and the front seats in the meeting places.
Matthew,23,7,"And when they are in the market, they like to have people greet them as their teachers."
Matthew,23,8,"But none of you should be called a teacher. You have only one teacher, and all of you are like brothers and sisters."
Matthew,23,9,Don't call anyone on earth your father. All of you have the same Father in heaven.
Matthew,23,10,None of you should be called the leader. The Messiah is your only leader.
Matthew,23,11,Whoever is the greatest should be the servant of the others.
Matthew,23,12,"If you put yourself above others, you will be put down. But if you humble yourself, you will be honoured."
Matthew,24,1,"After Jesus left the temple, his disciples came over and said, “Look at all these buildings!”"
Matthew,24,2,"Jesus replied, “Do you see these buildings? They will certainly be torn down! Not one stone will be left in place.”"
Matthew,24,3,"Later, as Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, his disciples came to him in private and asked, “When will this happen? What will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the world?”"
Matthew,24,4,Jesus answered: Don't let anyone fool you.
Matthew,24,5,"Many will come and claim to be me. They will say that they are the Messiah, and they will fool many people."
Matthew,24,6,"You will soon hear about wars and threats of wars, but don't be afraid. These things will have to happen first, but that isn't the end."
Matthew,24,7,"Nations and kingdoms will go to war against each other. People will starve to death, and in some places there will be earthquakes."
Matthew,24,8,But this is just the beginning of troubles.
Matthew,24,9,"You will be arrested, punished, and even killed. Because of me, you will be hated by people of all nations."
Matthew,24,10,Many will give up and will betray and hate each other.
Matthew,24,11,Many false prophets will come and fool a lot of people.
Matthew,24,12,Evil will spread and cause many people to stop loving others.
Matthew,24,13,"But if you keep on being faithful right to the end, you will be saved."
Matthew,24,14,"When the good news about the kingdom has been preached all over the world and told to all nations, the end will come."
Matthew,24,15,"Some day you will see that “Horrible Thing” in the holy place, just as the prophet Daniel said. Everyone who reads this must try to understand!"
Matthew,24,16,"If you are living in Judea at that time, run to the mountains."
Matthew,24,17,"If you are on the roof of your house, don't go inside to get anything."
Matthew,24,18,"If you are out in the field, don't go back for your coat."
Matthew,24,19,It will be a terrible time for women who are expecting babies or nursing young children.
Matthew,24,20,And pray that you won't have to escape in winter or on a Sabbath.
Matthew,24,21,"This will be the worst time of suffering since the beginning of the world, and nothing this terrible will ever happen again."
Matthew,24,22,"If God doesn't make the time shorter, no one will be left alive. But because of God's chosen ones, he will make the time shorter."
Matthew,24,23,"Someone may say, “Here is the Messiah!” or “There he is!” But don't believe it."
Matthew,24,24,False messiahs and false prophets will come and perform great miracles and signs. They will even try to fool God's chosen ones.
Matthew,24,25,But I have warned you beforehand.
Matthew,24,26,"If you are told that the Messiah is out in the desert, don't go there! And if you are told that he is in some secret place, don't believe it!"
Matthew,24,27,The coming of the Son of Man will be like lightning that can be seen from east to west.
Matthew,24,28,"Where there is a corpse, there will always be vultures."
Matthew,24,29,"Straight after those days of suffering, “The sun will become dark, and the moon will no longer shine. The stars will fall, and the powers in the sky will be shaken.”"
Matthew,24,30,Then a sign will appear in the sky. And there will be the Son of Man. All nations on earth will weep when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
Matthew,24,31,"At the sound of a loud trumpet, he will send his angels to bring his chosen ones together from all over the earth."
Matthew,24,32,"Learn a lesson from a fig tree. When its branches sprout and start putting out leaves, you know that summer is near."
Matthew,24,33,"So when you see all these things happening, you will know that the time has almost come."
Matthew,24,34,I can promise you that some of the people of this generation will still be alive when all this happens.
Matthew,24,35,"The sky and the earth won't last for ever, but my words will."
Matthew,24,36,"No one knows the day or hour. The angels in heaven don't know, and the Son himself doesn't know. Only the Father knows."
Matthew,24,37,"When the Son of Man appears, things will be just as they were when Noah lived."
Matthew,24,38,"People were eating, drinking, and getting married right up to the day that the flood came and Noah went into the big boat."
Matthew,24,39,They didn't know anything was happening until the flood came and swept them all away. That is how it will be when the Son of Man appears.
Matthew,24,40,"Two men will be in the same field, but only one will be taken. The other will be left."
Matthew,24,41,"Two women will be together grinding grain, but only one will be taken. The other will be left."
Matthew,24,42,So be on your guard! You don't know when your Lord will come.
Matthew,24,43,"Homeowners never know when a thief is coming, and they are always on guard to keep one from breaking in."
Matthew,24,44,Always be ready! You don't know when the Son of Man will come.
Matthew,24,45,Who are faithful and wise servants? Who are the ones the master will put in charge of giving the other servants their food supplies at the proper time?
Matthew,24,46,Servants are fortunate if their master comes and finds them doing their job.
Matthew,24,47,You may be sure that a servant who is always faithful will be put in charge of everything the master owns.
Matthew,24,48,But suppose one of the servants thinks that the master won't return until late.
Matthew,24,49,Suppose that evil servant starts beating the other servants and eats and drinks with people who are drunk.
Matthew,24,50,"If that happens, the master will come on a day and at a time when the servant least expects him."
Matthew,24,51,That servant will then be punished and thrown out with the ones who only pretended to serve their master. There they will cry and grit their teeth in pain.
Matthew,25,1,The kingdom of heaven is like what happened one night when ten girls took their oil lamps and went to a wedding to meet the groom.
Matthew,25,2,Five of the girls were foolish and five were wise.
Matthew,25,3,"The foolish ones took their lamps, but no extra oil."
Matthew,25,4,The ones who were wise took along extra oil for their lamps.
Matthew,25,5,"The groom was late arriving, and the girls became drowsy and fell asleep."
Matthew,25,6,"Then in the middle of the night someone shouted, “Here's the groom! Come to meet him!”"
Matthew,25,7,"When the girls got up and started getting their lamps ready,"
Matthew,25,8,"the foolish ones said to the others, “Let us have some of your oil! Our lamps are going out.”"
Matthew,25,9,"The girls who were wise answered, “There's not enough oil for all of us! Go and buy some for yourselves.”"
Matthew,25,10,"While the foolish girls were on their way to get some oil, the groom arrived. The girls who were ready went into the wedding, and the doors were closed."
Matthew,25,11,"Later the other girls returned and shouted, “Sir, sir! Open the door for us!”"
Matthew,25,12,"But the groom replied, “I don't even know you!”"
Matthew,25,13,"So, my disciples, always be ready! You don't know the day or the time when all this will happen."
Matthew,25,14,The kingdom is also like what happened when a man went away and put his three servants in charge of all he owned.
Matthew,25,15,"The man knew what each servant could do. So he handed five thousand coins to the first servant, two thousand to the second, and one thousand to the third. Then he left the country."
Matthew,25,16,"As soon as the man had gone, the servant with the five thousand coins used them to earn five thousand more."
Matthew,25,17,The servant who had two thousand coins did the same with his money and earned two thousand more.
Matthew,25,18,But the servant with one thousand coins dug a hole and hid his master's money in the ground.
Matthew,25,19,Some time later the master of those servants returned. He called them in and asked what they had done with his money.
Matthew,25,20,"The servant who had been given five thousand coins brought them in with the five thousand that he had earned. He said, “Sir, you gave me five thousand coins, and I have earned five thousand more.”"
Matthew,25,21,"“Wonderful!” his master replied. “You are a good and faithful servant. I left you in charge of only a little, but now I will put you in charge of much more. Come and share in my happiness!”"
Matthew,25,22,"Next, the servant who had been given two thousand coins came in and said, “Sir, you gave me two thousand coins, and I have earned two thousand more.”"
Matthew,25,23,"“Wonderful!” his master replied. “You are a good and faithful servant. I left you in charge of only a little, but now I will put you in charge of much more. Come and share in my happiness!”"
Matthew,25,24,"The servant who had been given one thousand coins then came in and said, “Sir, I know that you are hard to get along with. You harvest what you don't plant and gather crops where you haven't scattered seed."
Matthew,25,25,I was frightened and went out and hid your money in the ground. Here is every single coin!”
Matthew,25,26,"The master of the servant told him, “You are lazy and good-for-nothing! You know that I harvest what I don't plant and gather crops where I haven't scattered seed."
Matthew,25,27,"You could have at least put my money in the bank, so that I could have earned interest on it.”"
Matthew,25,28,"Then the master said, “Now your money will be taken away and given to the servant with ten thousand coins!"
Matthew,25,29,"Everyone who has something will be given more, and they will have more than enough. But everything will be taken from those who don't have anything."
Matthew,25,30,"You are a worthless servant, and you will be thrown out into the dark where people will cry and grit their teeth in pain.”"
Matthew,25,31,"When the Son of Man comes in his glory with all his angels, he will sit on his royal throne."
Matthew,25,32,"The people of all nations will be brought before him, and he will separate them, as shepherds separate their sheep from their goats."
Matthew,25,33,He will place the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
Matthew,25,34,"Then the king will say to those on his right, “My father has blessed you! Come and receive the kingdom that was prepared for you before the world was created."
Matthew,25,35,"When I was hungry, you gave me something to eat, and when I was thirsty, you gave me something to drink. When I was a stranger, you welcomed me,"
Matthew,25,36,"and when I was naked, you gave me clothes to wear. When I was sick, you took care of me, and when I was in jail, you visited me.”"
Matthew,25,37,"Then the ones who pleased the Lord will ask, “When did we give you something to eat or drink?"
Matthew,25,38,When did we welcome you as a stranger or give you clothes to wear
Matthew,25,39,or visit you while you were sick or in jail?”
Matthew,25,40,"The king will answer, “Whenever you did it for any of my people, no matter how unimportant they seemed, you did it for me.”"
Matthew,25,41,"Then the king will say to those on his left, “Get away from me! You are under God's curse. Go into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels!"
Matthew,25,42,"I was hungry, but you did not give me anything to eat, and I was thirsty, but you did not give me anything to drink."
Matthew,25,43,"I was a stranger, but you did not welcome me, and I was naked, but you did not give me any clothes to wear. I was sick and in jail, but you did not take care of me.”"
Matthew,25,44,"Then the people will ask, “Lord, when did we fail to help you when you were hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in jail?”"
Matthew,25,45,"The king will say to them, “Whenever you failed to help any of my people, no matter how unimportant they seemed, you failed to do it for me.”"
Matthew,25,46,"Then Jesus said, “Those people will be punished for ever. But the ones who pleased God will have eternal life.”"
Matthew,26,1,"When Jesus had finished teaching, he told his disciples,"
Matthew,26,2,“You know that two days from now will be Passover. That is when the Son of Man will be handed over to his enemies and nailed to a cross.”
Matthew,26,3,At that time the chief priests and the nation's leaders were meeting at the home of Caiaphas the high priest.
Matthew,26,4,They secretly planned to have Jesus arrested and put to death.
Matthew,26,5,"But they said, “We must not do it during Passover, because the people will riot.”"
Matthew,26,6,"Jesus was in the town of Bethany, eating at the home of Simon, who had leprosy."
Matthew,26,7,A woman came in with a bottle of expensive perfume and poured it on Jesus' head.
Matthew,26,8,"But when his disciples saw this, they became angry and complained, “Why such a waste?"
Matthew,26,9,We could have sold this perfume for a lot of money and given it to the poor.”
Matthew,26,10,"Jesus knew what they were thinking, and he said: Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing for me."
Matthew,26,11,"You will always have the poor with you, but you won't always have me."
Matthew,26,12,She has poured perfume on my body to prepare it for burial.
Matthew,26,13,"You may be sure that wherever the good news is told all over the world, people will remember what she has done. And they will tell others."
Matthew,26,14,Judas Iscariot was one of the twelve disciples. He went to the chief priests
Matthew,26,15,"and asked, “How much will you give me if I help you arrest Jesus?” They paid Judas thirty silver coins,"
Matthew,26,16,and from then on he started looking for a good chance to betray Jesus.
Matthew,26,17,"On the first day of the Festival of Thin Bread, Jesus' disciples came to him and asked, “Where do you want us to prepare the Passover meal?”"
Matthew,26,18,"Jesus told them to go to a certain man in the city and tell him, “Our teacher says, ‘My time has come! I want to eat the Passover meal with my disciples in your home.’ ”"
Matthew,26,19,They did as Jesus told them and prepared the meal.
Matthew,27,1,Early the next morning all the chief priests and the nation's leaders met and decided that Jesus should be put to death.
Matthew,27,2,They tied him up and led him away to Pilate the governor.
Matthew,27,3,"Judas had betrayed Jesus, but when he learnt that Jesus had been sentenced to death, he was sorry for what he had done. He returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and leaders"
Matthew,27,4,"and said, “I have sinned by betraying a man who has never done anything wrong.” “So what? That's your problem,” they replied."
Matthew,27,5,Judas threw the money into the temple and then went out and hanged himself.
Matthew,27,6,"The chief priests picked up the money and said, “This money was paid to have a man killed. We can't put it in the temple treasury.”"
Matthew,27,7,Then they had a meeting and decided to buy a field that belonged to someone who made clay pots. They wanted to use it as a graveyard for foreigners.
Matthew,27,8,That's why people still call that place “Field of Blood”.
Matthew,27,9,"So the words of the prophet Jeremiah came true, “They took the thirty silver coins, the price of a person among the people of Israel."
Matthew,27,10,"They paid it for a potter's field, as the Lord had commanded me.”"
Matthew,27,11,"Jesus was brought before Pilate the governor, who asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?” “Those are your words!” Jesus answered."
Matthew,27,12,"And when the chief priests and leaders brought their charges against him, he did not say a thing."
Matthew,27,13,"Pilate asked him, “Don't you hear what crimes they say you have done?”"
Matthew,27,14,"But Jesus did not say anything, and the governor was greatly amazed."
Matthew,27,15,During Passover the governor always freed a prisoner chosen by the people.
Matthew,27,16,At that time a well known terrorist named Jesus Barabbas was in jail.
Matthew,27,17,"So when the crowd came together, Pilate asked them, “Which prisoner do you want me to set free? Do you want Jesus Barabbas or Jesus who is called the Messiah?”"
Matthew,27,18,Pilate knew that the leaders had brought Jesus to him because they were jealous.
Matthew,27,19,"While Pilate was judging the case, his wife sent him a message. It said, “Don't have anything to do with that innocent man. I have had nightmares because of him.”"
Matthew,27,20,But the chief priests and the leaders convinced the crowds to ask for Barabbas to be set free and for Jesus to be killed.
Matthew,27,21,"Pilate asked the crowd again, “Which of these two men do you want me to set free?” “Barabbas!” they replied."
Matthew,27,22,"Pilate asked them, “What am I to do with Jesus, who is called the Messiah?” They all yelled, “Nail him to a cross!”"
Matthew,27,23,"Pilate answered, “But what crime has he done?” “Nail him to a cross!” they yelled even louder."
Matthew,27,24,"Pilate saw that there was nothing he could do and that the people were starting to riot. So he took some water and washed his hands in front of them and said, “I won't have anything to do with killing this man. You are the ones doing it!”"
Matthew,27,25,"Everyone answered, “We and our own families will take the blame for his death!”"
Matthew,27,26,Pilate set Barabbas free. Then he ordered his soldiers to beat Jesus with a whip and nail him to a cross.
Matthew,27,27,The governor's soldiers led Jesus into the fortress and brought together the rest of the troops.
Matthew,27,28,They stripped off Jesus' clothes and put a scarlet robe on him.
Matthew,27,29,"They made a crown out of thorn branches and placed it on his head, and they put a stick in his right hand. The soldiers knelt down and pretended to worship him. They made fun of him and shouted, “Hey, you king of the Jews!”"
Matthew,27,30,Then they spat on him. They took the stick from him and beat him on the head with it.
Matthew,27,31,"When the soldiers had finished making fun of Jesus, they took off the robe. They put his own clothes back on him and led him off to be nailed to a cross."
Matthew,27,32,"On the way they met a man from Cyrene named Simon, and they forced him to carry Jesus' cross."
Matthew,27,33,"They came to a place named Golgotha, which means “Place of a Skull”."
Matthew,27,34,"There they gave Jesus some wine mixed with a drug to ease the pain. But when Jesus tasted what it was, he refused to drink it."
Matthew,27,35,The soldiers nailed Jesus to a cross and gambled to see who would get his clothes.
Matthew,27,36,Then they sat down to guard him.
Matthew,27,37,"Above his head they put a sign that told why he was nailed there. It read, “This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.”"
Matthew,27,38,"The soldiers also nailed two criminals on crosses, one to the right of Jesus and the other to his left."
Matthew,27,39,People who passed by said terrible things about Jesus. They shook their heads and
Matthew,27,40,"shouted, “So you're the one who claimed you could tear down the temple and build it again in three days! If you are God's Son, save yourself and come down from the cross!”"
Matthew,27,41,"The chief priests, the leaders, and the teachers of the Law of Moses also made fun of Jesus. They said,"
Matthew,27,42,"“He saved others, but he can't save himself. If he is the king of Israel, he should come down from the cross! Then we will believe him."
Matthew,27,43,"He trusted God, so let God save him, if he wants to. He even said he was God's Son.”"
Matthew,27,44,The two criminals also said cruel things to Jesus.
Matthew,27,45,At midday the sky turned dark and stayed that way until three o'clock.
Matthew,27,46,"Then about that time Jesus shouted, “Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?” which means, “My God, my God, why have you deserted me?”"
Matthew,27,47,"Some of the people standing there heard Jesus and said, “He's calling for Elijah.”"
Matthew,27,48,"One of them at once ran and grabbed a sponge. He soaked it in wine, then put it on a stick and held it up to Jesus."
Matthew,27,49,"Others said, “Wait! Let's see if Elijah will come and save him.”"
Matthew,27,50,"Once again Jesus shouted, and then he died."
Matthew,27,51,"At once the curtain in the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook, and rocks split apart."
Matthew,27,52,"Graves opened, and many of God's people were raised to life."
Matthew,27,53,"Then after Jesus had risen to life, they came out of their graves and went into the holy city, where they were seen by many people."
Matthew,27,54,"The officer and the soldiers guarding Jesus felt the earthquake and saw everything else that happened. They were frightened and said, “This man really was God's Son!”"
Matthew,27,55,"Many women had come with Jesus from Galilee to be of help to him, and they were there, looking on at a distance."
Matthew,27,56,"Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of James and John were some of these women."
Matthew,27,57,That evening a rich disciple named Joseph from the town of Arimathea
Matthew,27,58,"went and asked for Jesus' body. Pilate gave orders for it to be given to Joseph,"
Matthew,27,59,who took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.
Matthew,27,60,Then Joseph put the body in his own tomb that had been cut into solid rock and had never been used. He rolled a big stone against the entrance to the tomb and went away.
Matthew,27,61,All this time Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting across from the tomb.
Matthew,27,62,"On the next day, which was a Sabbath, the chief priests and the Pharisees went together to Pilate."
Matthew,27,63,"They said, “Sir, we remember what that liar said while he was still alive. He claimed that in three days he would come back from death."
Matthew,27,64,"So please order the tomb to be carefully guarded for three days. If you don't, his disciples may come and steal his body. They will tell the people that he has been raised to life, and this last lie will be worse than the first one.”"
Matthew,27,65,"Pilate said to them, “All right, take some of your soldiers and guard the tomb as well as you know how.”"
Matthew,27,66,So they sealed it tight and placed soldiers there to guard it.
Matthew,28,1,"The Sabbath was over, and it was almost daybreak on Sunday when Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb."
Matthew,28,2,"Suddenly a strong earthquake struck, and the Lord's angel came down from heaven. He rolled away the stone and sat on it."
Matthew,28,3,"The angel looked as bright as lightning, and his clothes were white as snow."
Matthew,28,4,"The guards shook from fear and fell down, as though they were dead."
Matthew,28,5,"The angel said to the women, “Don't be afraid! I know you are looking for Jesus, who was nailed to a cross."
Matthew,28,6,"He isn't here! God has raised him to life, just as Jesus said he would. Come, see the place where his body was lying."
Matthew,28,7,"Now hurry! Tell his disciples that he has been raised to life and is on his way to Galilee. Go there, and you will see him. That is what I came to tell you.”"
Matthew,28,8,"The women were frightened and yet very happy, as they hurried from the tomb and ran to tell his disciples."
Matthew,28,9,"Suddenly Jesus met them and greeted them. They went near him, held on to his feet, and worshipped him."
Matthew,28,10,"Then Jesus said, “Don't be afraid! Tell my followers to go to Galilee. They will see me there.”"
Matthew,28,11,"While the women were on their way, some soldiers who had been guarding the tomb went into the city. They told the chief priests everything that had happened."
Matthew,28,12,So the chief priests met with the leaders and decided to bribe the soldiers with a lot of money.
Matthew,28,13,"They said to the soldiers, “Tell everyone that Jesus' disciples came during the night and stole his body while you were asleep."
Matthew,28,14,"If the governor hears about this, we will talk to him. You won't have anything to worry about.”"
Matthew,28,15,The soldiers took the money and did what they were told. Some of the Jewish people still tell each other this story.
Matthew,28,16,"Jesus' eleven disciples went to a mountain in Galilee, where Jesus had told them to meet him."
Matthew,28,17,"They saw him and worshipped him, but some of them doubted."
Matthew,28,18,Jesus came to them and said: I have been given all authority in heaven and on earth!
Matthew,28,19,"Go to the people of all nations and make them my disciples. Baptize them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,"
Matthew,28,20,"and teach them to do everything I have told you. I will be with you always, even until the end of the world."
Mark,1,1,"This is the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God."
Mark,1,2,"It began just as God had said in the book written by Isaiah the prophet, “I am sending my messenger to get the way ready for you."
Mark,1,3,"In the desert someone is shouting, ‘Get the road ready for the Lord! Make a straight path for him.’ ”"
Mark,1,4,"So John the Baptist appeared in the desert and told everyone, “Turn back to God and be baptized! Then your sins will be forgiven.”"
Mark,1,5,"From all Judea and Jerusalem crowds of people went to John. They told how sorry they were for their sins, and he baptized them in the River Jordan."
Mark,1,6,John wore clothes made of camel's hair. He had a leather strap around his waist and ate grasshoppers and wild honey.
Mark,1,7,"John also told the people, “Someone more powerful is going to come. And I am not good enough even to stoop down and untie his sandals."
Mark,1,8,"I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit!”"
Mark,1,9,"About that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee, and John baptized him in the River Jordan."
Mark,1,10,"As soon as Jesus came out of the water, he saw the sky open and the Holy Spirit coming down to him like a dove."
Mark,1,11,"A voice from heaven said, “You are my own dear Son, and I am pleased with you.”"
Mark,1,12,Straight away God's Spirit made Jesus go into the desert.
Mark,1,13,"He stayed there for forty days while Satan tested him. Jesus was with the wild animals, but angels took care of him."
Mark,1,14,"After John was arrested, Jesus went to Galilee and told the good news that comes from God."
Mark,1,15,"He said, “The time has come! God's kingdom will soon be here. Turn back to God and believe the good news!”"
Mark,1,16,"As Jesus was walking along the shore of Lake Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were fishermen and were casting their nets into the lake."
Mark,1,17,"Jesus said to them, “Come with me! I will teach you how to bring in people instead of fish.”"
Mark,1,18,At once the two brothers dropped their nets and went with him.
Mark,1,19,"Jesus walked on and soon saw James and John, the sons of Zebedee. They were in a boat, mending their nets."
Mark,1,20,At once Jesus asked them to come with him. They left their father in the boat with the hired workers and went with him.
Mark,1,21,Jesus and his disciples went to the town of Capernaum. Then on the next Sabbath he went into the Jewish meeting place and started teaching.
Mark,1,22,"Everyone was amazed at his teaching. He taught with authority, and not like the teachers of the Law of Moses."
Mark,1,23,"Suddenly a man with an evil spirit in him entered the meeting place and yelled,"
Mark,1,24,"“Jesus from Nazareth, what do you want with us? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are! You are God's Holy One.”"
Mark,1,25,"Jesus told the evil spirit, “Be quiet and come out of the man!”"
Mark,1,26,The spirit shook him. Then it gave a loud shout and left.
Mark,1,27,"Everyone was completely surprised and kept saying to each other, “What is this? It must be some new kind of powerful teaching! Even the evil spirits obey him.”"
Mark,1,28,News about Jesus quickly spread all over Galilee.
Mark,1,29,"As soon as Jesus left the meeting place with James and John, they went home with Simon and Andrew."
Mark,1,30,"When they got there, Jesus was told that Simon's mother-in-law was sick in bed with fever."
Mark,1,31,"Jesus went to her. He took hold of her hand and helped her up. The fever left her, and she served them a meal."
Mark,1,32,"That evening after sunset, all who were sick or had demons in them were brought to Jesus."
Mark,1,33,"In fact, the whole town gathered around the door of the house."
Mark,1,34,"Jesus healed all kinds of terrible diseases and forced out a lot of demons. But the demons knew who he was, and he did not let them speak."
Mark,1,35,"Very early the next morning, Jesus got up and went to a place where he could be alone and pray."
Mark,1,36,Simon and the others started looking for him.
Mark,1,37,"And when they found him, they said, “Everyone is looking for you!”"
Mark,1,38,"Jesus replied, “We must go to the nearby towns, so that I can tell the good news to those people. This is why I have come.”"
Mark,1,39,"Then Jesus went to Jewish meeting places everywhere in Galilee, where he preached and forced out demons."
Mark,1,40,"A man with leprosy came to Jesus and knelt down. He begged, “You have the power to make me well, if only you wanted to.”"
Mark,1,41,"Jesus felt sorry for the man. So he put his hand on him and said, “I want to! Now you are well.”"
Mark,1,42,"At once the man's leprosy disappeared, and he was well."
Mark,1,43,"After Jesus strictly warned the man, he sent him on his way."
Mark,1,44,"He said, “Don't tell anyone about this. Just go and show the priest that you are well. Then take a gift to the temple as Moses commanded, and everyone will know that you have been healed.”"
Mark,1,45,"The man talked about it so much and told so many people, that Jesus could no longer go openly into a town. He had to stay away from the towns, but people still came to him from everywhere."
Mark,2,1,"Jesus went back to Capernaum, and a few days later people heard that he was at home."
Mark,2,2,Then so many of them came to the house that there wasn't even standing room left in front of the door. Jesus was still teaching
Mark,2,3,"when four people came up, carrying a crippled man on a mat."
Mark,2,4,"But because of the crowd, they could not get him to Jesus. So they made a hole in the roof above him and let the man down in front of everyone."
Mark,2,5,"When Jesus saw how much faith they had, he said to the crippled man, “My friend, your sins are forgiven.”"
Mark,2,6,"Some of the teachers of the Law of Moses were sitting there. They started wondering,"
Mark,2,7,“Why would he say such a thing? He must think he is God! Only God can forgive sins.”
Mark,2,8,"Straight away, Jesus knew what they were thinking, and he said, “Why are you thinking such things?"
Mark,2,9,Is it easier for me to tell this crippled man that his sins are forgiven or to tell him to get up and pick up his mat and go on home?
Mark,2,10,"I will show you that the Son of Man has the right to forgive sins here on earth.” So Jesus said to the man,"
Mark,2,11,“Get up! Pick up your mat and go on home.”
Mark,2,12,"The man got straight up. He picked up his mat and went out while everyone watched in amazement. They praised God and said, “We have never seen anything like this!”"
Mark,2,13,"Once again, Jesus went to the shore of Lake Galilee. A large crowd gathered around him, and he taught them."
Mark,2,14,"As he walked along, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus. Levi was sitting at the place for paying taxes, and Jesus said to him, “Come with me!” So he got up and went with Jesus."
Mark,2,15,"Later, Jesus and his disciples were having dinner at Levi's house. Many tax collectors and other sinners had become followers of Jesus, and they were also guests at the dinner."
Mark,2,16,"Some of the teachers of the Law of Moses were Pharisees, and they saw that Jesus was eating with sinners and tax collectors. So they asked his disciples, “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?”"
Mark,2,17,"Jesus heard them and answered, “Healthy people don't need a doctor, but sick people do. I didn't come to invite good people to be my followers. I came to invite sinners.”"
Mark,2,18,"The followers of John the Baptist and the Pharisees often went without eating. Some people came and asked Jesus, “Why do the followers of John and those of the Pharisees often go without eating, while your disciples never do?”"
Mark,2,19,Jesus answered: The friends of a bridegroom don't go without eating while he is still with them.
Mark,2,20,But the time will come when he will be taken from them. Then they will go without eating.
Mark,2,21,No one patches old clothes by sewing on a piece of new cloth. The new piece would shrink and tear a bigger hole.
Mark,2,22,"No one pours new wine into old wineskins. The wine would swell and burst the old skins. Then the wine would be lost, and the skins would be ruined. New wine must be put into new wineskins."
Mark,2,23,One Sabbath Jesus and his disciples were walking through some wheat fields. His disciples were picking grains of wheat as they went along.
Mark,2,24,"Some Pharisees asked Jesus, “Why are your disciples picking grain on the Sabbath? They are not supposed to do that!”"
Mark,2,25,"Jesus answered, “Haven't you read what David did when he and his followers were hungry and in need?"
Mark,2,26,It was during the time of Abiathar the high priest. David went into the house of God and ate the sacred loaves of bread that only priests are allowed to eat. He also gave some to his followers.”
Mark,2,27,"Jesus finished by saying, “People were not made for the good of the Sabbath. The Sabbath was made for the good of people."
Mark,2,28,So the Son of Man is Lord over the Sabbath.”
Mark,3,1,"The next time that Jesus went into the meeting place, a man with a crippled hand was there."
Mark,3,2,"The Pharisees wanted to accuse Jesus of doing something wrong, and they kept watching to see if Jesus would heal him on the Sabbath."
Mark,3,3,Jesus told the man to stand up where everyone could see him.
Mark,3,4,"Then he asked, “On the Sabbath should we do good deeds or evil deeds? Should we save someone's life or destroy it?” But no one said a word."
Mark,3,5,"Jesus was angry as he looked around at the people. Yet he felt sorry for them because they were so stubborn. Then he told the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He did, and his bad hand was healed."
Mark,3,6,The Pharisees left. And straight away they started making plans with Herod's followers to kill Jesus.
Mark,3,7,"Jesus led his disciples down to the shore of the lake. Large crowds followed him from Galilee, Judea,"
Mark,3,8,"and Jerusalem. People came from Idumea, as well as other places east of the River Jordan. They also came from the region around the cities of Tyre and Sidon. All these crowds came because they had heard what Jesus was doing."
Mark,3,9,He even had to tell his disciples to get a boat ready to keep him from being crushed by the crowds.
Mark,3,10,"After Jesus had healed many people, the other sick people begged him to let them touch him."
Mark,3,11,"And whenever any evil spirits saw Jesus, they would fall to the ground and shout, “You are the Son of God!”"
Mark,3,12,But Jesus warned the spirits not to tell who he was.
Mark,3,13,"Jesus decided to ask some of his disciples to go up on a mountain with him, and they went."
Mark,3,14,"Then he chose twelve of them to be his apostles, so that they could be with him. He also wanted to send them out to preach"
Mark,3,15,and to force out demons.
Mark,3,16,"Simon was one of the twelve, and Jesus named him Peter."
Mark,3,17,"There were also James and John, the two sons of Zebedee. Jesus called them Boanerges, which means “Thunderbolts”."
Mark,3,18,"Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus were also apostles. The others were Simon, known as the Eager One,"
Mark,3,19,"and Judas Iscariot, who later betrayed Jesus."
Mark,3,20,"Jesus went back home, and once again such a large crowd gathered that there was no chance even to eat."
Mark,3,21,"When Jesus' family heard what he was doing, they thought he was mad and went to get him under control."
Mark,3,22,"Some teachers of the Law of Moses came from Jerusalem and said, “This man is under the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of demons! He is even forcing out demons with the help of Beelzebul.”"
Mark,3,23,Jesus told the people to gather around him. Then he spoke to them in riddles and said: How can Satan force himself out?
Mark,3,24,A nation whose people fight each other won't last very long.
Mark,3,25,And a family that fights won't last long either.
Mark,3,26,"So if Satan fights against himself, that will be the end of him."
Mark,3,27,"How can anyone break into the house of a strong man and steal his things, unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can take everything."
Mark,3,28,"I promise you that any of the sinful things you say or do can be forgiven, no matter how terrible those things are."
Mark,3,29,"But if you speak against the Holy Spirit, you can never be forgiven. That sin will be held against you for ever."
Mark,3,30,Jesus said this because the people were saying that he had an evil spirit in him.
Mark,3,31,Jesus' mother and brothers came and stood outside. Then they sent someone with a message for him to come out to them.
Mark,3,32,"The crowd that was sitting around Jesus told him, “Your mother and your brothers and sisters are outside and want to see you.”"
Mark,3,33,"Jesus asked, “Who is my mother and who are my brothers?”"
Mark,3,34,"Then he looked at the people sitting around him and said, “Here are my mother and my brothers."
Mark,3,35,Anyone who obeys God is my brother or sister or mother.”
Mark,4,1,"The next time Jesus taught beside Lake Galilee, a big crowd gathered. It was so large that he had to sit in a boat out on the lake, while the people stood on the shore."
Mark,4,2,"He used stories to teach them many things, and this is part of what he taught:"
Mark,4,3,Now listen! A farmer went out to scatter seed in a field.
Mark,4,4,"While the farmer was scattering the seed, some of it fell along the road and was eaten by birds."
Mark,4,5,"Other seeds fell on thin, rocky ground and quickly started growing because the soil wasn't very deep."
Mark,4,6,"But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched and dried up, because they did not have enough roots."
Mark,4,7,Some other seeds fell where thorn bushes grew up and choked out the plants. So they did not produce any grain.
Mark,4,8,But a few seeds did fall on good ground where the plants grew and produced thirty or sixty or even a hundred times as much as was scattered.
Mark,4,9,"Then Jesus said, “If you have ears, pay attention.”"
Mark,4,10,"When Jesus was alone with the twelve apostles and some others, they asked him about these stories."
Mark,4,11,"He answered: I have explained the secret about God's kingdom to you, but for others I can use only stories."
Mark,4,12,"The reason is, “These people will look and look, but never see. They will listen and listen, but never understand. If they did, they would turn to God, and he would forgive them.”"
Mark,4,13,"Jesus told them: If you don't understand this story, you won't understand any others."
Mark,4,14,What the farmer is spreading is really the message about the kingdom.
Mark,4,15,The seeds that fell along the road are the people who hear the message. But Satan soon comes and snatches it away from them.
Mark,4,16,The seeds that fell on rocky ground are the people who gladly hear the message and accept it straight away.
Mark,4,17,"But they don't have any roots, and they don't last very long. As soon as life gets hard or the message gets them in trouble, they give up."
Mark,4,18,The seeds that fell among the thorn bushes are also people who hear the message.
Mark,4,19,"But they start worrying about the needs of this life. They are fooled by the desire to get rich and to have all kinds of other things. So the message gets choked out, and they never produce anything."
Mark,4,20,The seeds that fell on good ground are the people who hear and welcome the message. They produce thirty or sixty or even a hundred times as much as was planted.
Mark,4,21,Jesus also said: You don't light a lamp and put it under a clay pot or under a bed. Don't you put a lamp on a lampstand?
Mark,4,22,There is nothing hidden that will not be made public. There is no secret that will not be well known.
Mark,4,23,"If you have ears, pay attention!"
Mark,4,24,Listen carefully to what you hear! The way you treat others will be the way you will be treated—and even worse.
Mark,4,25,Everyone who has something will be given more. But people who don't have anything will lose what little they have.
Mark,4,26,Again Jesus said: God's kingdom is like what happens when a farmer scatters seed in a field.
Mark,4,27,"The farmer sleeps at night and is up and around during the day. Yet the seeds keep sprouting and growing, and he doesn't understand how."
Mark,4,28,It is the ground that makes the seeds sprout and grow into plants that produce grain.
Mark,4,29,"Then when harvest season comes and the grain is ripe, the farmer cuts it with a sickle."
Mark,4,30,"Finally, Jesus said: What is God's kingdom like? What story can I use to explain it?"
Mark,4,31,It is like what happens when a mustard seed is planted in the ground. It is the smallest seed in all the world.
Mark,4,32,"But once it is planted, it grows larger than any garden plant. It even puts out branches that are big enough for birds to nest in its shade."
Mark,4,33,"Jesus used many other stories when he spoke to the people, and he taught them as much as they could understand."
Mark,4,34,"He did not tell them anything without using stories. But when he was alone with his disciples, he explained everything to them."
Mark,4,35,"That evening, Jesus said to his disciples, “Let's cross to the east side.”"
Mark,4,36,"So they left the crowd, and his disciples started across the lake with him in the boat. Some other boats followed along."
Mark,4,37,"Suddenly a storm struck the lake. Waves started splashing into the boat, and it was about to sink."
Mark,4,38,"Jesus was in the back of the boat with his head on a pillow, and he was asleep. His disciples woke him and said, “Teacher, don't you care that we're about to drown?”"
Mark,4,39,"Jesus got up and ordered the wind and the waves to be quiet. The wind stopped, and everything was calm."
Mark,4,40,"Jesus asked his disciples, “Why were you afraid? Don't you have any faith?”"
Mark,4,41,"Now they were more afraid than ever and said to each other, “Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!”"
Mark,5,1,Jesus and his disciples crossed Lake Galilee and came to shore near the town of Gerasa.
Mark,5,2,"When he was getting out of the boat, a man with an evil spirit quickly ran to him"
Mark,5,3,"from the graveyard where he had been living. No one was able to tie the man up any more, not even with a chain."
Mark,5,4,"He had often been put in chains and leg irons, but he broke the chains and smashed the leg irons. No one could control him."
Mark,5,5,"Night and day he was in the graveyard or on the hills, yelling and cutting himself with stones."
Mark,5,6,"When the man saw Jesus in the distance, he ran up to him and knelt down."
Mark,5,7,"He shouted, “Jesus, Son of God in heaven, what do you want with me? Promise me in God's name that you won't torture me!”"
Mark,5,8,The man said this because Jesus had already told the evil spirit to come out of him.
Mark,5,9,"Jesus asked, “What is your name?” The man answered, “My name is Lots, because I have ‘lots’ of evil spirits.”"
Mark,5,10,He then begged Jesus not to send them away.
Mark,5,11,Over on the hillside a large herd of pigs was feeding.
Mark,5,12,"So the evil spirits begged Jesus, “Send us into those pigs! Let us go into them.”"
Mark,5,13,"Jesus let them go, and they went out of the man and into the pigs. The whole herd of about two thousand pigs rushed down the steep bank into the lake and drowned."
Mark,5,14,The men taking care of the pigs ran to the town and the farms to spread the news. Then the people came out to see what had happened.
Mark,5,15,"When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had once been full of demons. He was sitting there with his clothes on and in his right mind, and they were terrified."
Mark,5,16,Everyone who had seen what had happened told about the man and the pigs.
Mark,5,17,Then the people started begging Jesus to leave their part of the country.
Mark,5,18,"When Jesus was getting into the boat, the man begged to go with him."
Mark,5,19,"But Jesus would not let him. Instead, he said, “Go home to your family and tell them how much the Lord has done for you and how good he has been to you.”"
Mark,5,20,The man went away into the region near the ten cities known as Decapolis and began telling everyone how much Jesus had done for him. Everyone who heard what had happened was amazed.
Mark,5,21,"Once again Jesus got into the boat and crossed Lake Galilee. Then as he stood on the shore, a large crowd gathered around him."
Mark,5,22,"The person in charge of the Jewish meeting place was also there. His name was Jairus, and when he saw Jesus, he went over to him. He knelt at Jesus' feet"
Mark,5,23,"and started begging him for help. He said, “My daughter is about to die! Please come and touch her, so she will get well and live.”"
Mark,5,24,Jesus went with Jairus. Many people followed along and kept crowding around.
Mark,5,25,In the crowd was a woman who had been bleeding for twelve years.
Mark,5,26,"She had gone to many doctors, and they had not done anything except cause her a lot of pain. She had paid them all the money she had. But instead of getting better, she only got worse."
Mark,5,27,"The woman had heard about Jesus, so she came up behind him in the crowd and barely touched his clothes."
Mark,5,28,"She had said to herself, “If I can just touch his clothes, I will get well.”"
Mark,5,29,"As soon as she touched them, her bleeding stopped, and she knew she was well."
Mark,5,30,"At that moment Jesus felt power go out from him. He turned to the crowd and asked, “Who touched my clothes?”"
Mark,5,31,"His disciples said to him, “Look at all these people crowding around you! How can you ask who touched you?”"
Mark,5,32,But Jesus turned to see who had touched him.
Mark,5,33,The woman knew what had happened to her. She came shaking with fear and knelt down in front of Jesus. Then she told him the whole story.
Mark,5,34,"Jesus said to the woman, “You are now well because of your faith. May God give you peace! You are healed, and you will no longer be in pain.”"
Mark,5,35,"While Jesus was still speaking, some men came from Jairus' home and said, “Your daughter has died! Why bother the teacher any more?”"
Mark,5,36,"Jesus heard what they said, and he said to Jairus, “Don't worry. Just have faith!”"
Mark,5,37,"Jesus did not let anyone go with him except Peter and the two brothers, James and John."
Mark,5,38,They went home with Jairus and saw the people crying and making a lot of noise.
Mark,5,39,"Then Jesus went inside and said to them, “Why are you crying and carrying on like this? The child isn't dead. She is just asleep.”"
Mark,5,40,"But the people laughed at him. After Jesus had sent them all out of the house, he took the girl's father and mother and his three disciples and went to where she was."
Mark,6,1,Jesus left and returned to his home town with his disciples.
Mark,6,2,"The next Sabbath he taught in the Jewish meeting place. Many of the people who heard him were amazed and asked, “How can he do all this? Where did he get such wisdom and the power to perform these miracles?"
Mark,6,3,"Isn't he the carpenter, the son of Mary? Aren't James, Joseph, Judas, and Simon his brothers? Don't his sisters still live here in our town?” The people were very unhappy because of what he was doing."
Mark,6,4,"But Jesus said, “Prophets are honoured by everyone, except the people of their home town and their relatives and their own family.”"
Mark,6,5,"Jesus could not perform any miracles there, except to heal a few sick people by placing his hands on them."
Mark,6,6,He was surprised that the people did not have any faith. Jesus taught in all the neighbouring villages.
Mark,6,7,Then he called together his twelve apostles and sent them out two by two with power over evil spirits.
Mark,6,8,"He told them, “You may take along a walking stick. But don't carry food or a travelling bag or any money."
Mark,6,9,"It's all right to wear sandals, but don't take along a change of clothes."
Mark,6,10,"When you are welcomed into a home, stay there until you leave that town."
Mark,6,11,"If any place won't welcome you or listen to your message, leave and shake the dust from your feet as a warning to them.”"
Mark,6,12,The apostles left and started telling everyone to turn to God.
Mark,6,13,They forced out many demons and healed a lot of sick people by putting olive oil on them.
Mark,6,14,"Jesus became so well known that Herod the ruler heard about him. Some people thought he was John the Baptist, who had come back to life with the power to perform miracles."
Mark,6,15,Others thought he was Elijah or some other prophet who had lived long ago.
Mark,6,16,"But when Herod heard about Jesus, he said, “This must be John! I had his head cut off, and now he has come back to life.”"
Mark,7,1,Some Pharisees and several teachers of the Law of Moses from Jerusalem came and gathered around Jesus.
Mark,7,2,They noticed that some of his disciples ate without first washing their hands.
Mark,7,3,The Pharisees and many other Jewish people obey the teachings of their ancestors. They always wash their hands in the proper way before eating.
Mark,7,4,"None of them will eat anything they buy in the market until it is washed. They also follow a lot of other teachings, such as washing cups, jugs, and bowls."
Mark,7,5,"The Pharisees and teachers asked Jesus, “Why don't your disciples obey what our ancestors taught us to do? Why do they eat without washing their hands?”"
Mark,7,6,"Jesus replied: You are nothing but show-offs! The prophet Isaiah was right when he wrote that God had said, “All of you praise me with your words, but you never really think about me."
Mark,7,7,"It is useless for you to worship me, when you teach rules made up by humans.”"
Mark,7,8,You disobey God's commands in order to obey what humans have taught.
Mark,7,9,You are good at rejecting God's commands so that you can follow your own teachings!
Mark,7,10,Didn't Moses command you to respect your father and mother? Didn't he tell you to put to death all who curse their parents?
Mark,7,11,But you let people get by without helping their parents when they should. You let them say that what they own has been offered to God.
Mark,7,12,You won't let those people help their parents.
Mark,7,13,And you ignore God's commands in order to follow your own teaching. You do a lot of other things that are just as bad.
Mark,7,14,"Jesus called the crowd together again and said, “Pay attention and try to understand what I mean."
Mark,8,1,"One day another large crowd gathered around Jesus. They had not brought along anything to eat. So Jesus called his disciples together and said,"
Mark,8,2,"“I feel sorry for these people. They have been with me for three days, and they don't have anything to eat."
Mark,8,3,"Some of them live a long way from here. If I send them away hungry, they might faint on their way home.”"
Mark,8,4,"The disciples said, “This place is like a desert. Where can we find enough food to feed such a crowd?”"
Mark,8,5,"Jesus asked them how much food they had. They replied, “Seven small loaves of bread.”"
Mark,8,6,"After Jesus told the crowd to sit down, he took the seven loaves and blessed them. He then broke the loaves and handed them to his disciples, who passed them out to the crowd."
Mark,8,7,"They also had a few little fish, and after Jesus had blessed these, he told the disciples to pass them around."
Mark,9,1,I can assure you that some of the people standing here will not die before they see God's kingdom come with power.
Mark,9,2,"Six days later Jesus took Peter, James, and John with him. They went up on a high mountain, where they could be alone. There in front of the disciples, Jesus was completely changed."
Mark,9,3,And his clothes became much whiter than any bleach on earth could make them.
Mark,9,4,Then Moses and Elijah were there talking with Jesus.
Mark,9,5,"Peter said to Jesus, “Teacher, it is good for us to be here! Let us make three shelters, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”"
Mark,9,6,"But Peter and the others were terribly frightened, and he did not know what he was talking about."
Mark,9,7,"The shadow of a cloud passed over and covered them. From the cloud a voice said, “This is my Son, and I love him. Listen to what he says!”"
Mark,9,8,"At once the disciples looked around, but they saw only Jesus."
Mark,9,9,"As Jesus and his disciples were coming down the mountain, he told them not to say a word about what they had seen, until the Son of Man had been raised from death."
Mark,9,10,So they kept it to themselves. But they wondered what he meant by the words “raised from death”.
Mark,9,11,"The disciples asked Jesus, “Don't the teachers of the Law of Moses say that Elijah must come before the Messiah does?”"
Mark,9,12,Jesus answered: Elijah certainly will come to get everything ready. But don't the Scriptures also say that the Son of Man must suffer terribly and be rejected?
Mark,9,13,"I can assure you that Elijah has already come. And people treated him just as they wanted to, as the Scriptures say they would."
Mark,9,14,"When Jesus and his three disciples came back down, they saw a large crowd around the other disciples. The teachers of the Law of Moses were arguing with them."
Mark,9,15,"The crowd was really surprised to see Jesus, and everyone hurried over to greet him."
Mark,9,16,"Jesus asked, “What are you arguing about?”"
Mark,9,17,"Someone from the crowd answered, “Teacher, I brought my son to you. A demon keeps him from talking."
Mark,9,18,"Whenever the demon attacks my son, it throws him to the ground and makes him foam at the mouth and grit his teeth in pain. Then he becomes stiff. I asked your disciples to force out the demon, but they couldn't do it.”"
Mark,9,19,"Jesus said, “You people don't have any faith! How much longer must I be with you? Why do I have to put up with you? Bring the boy to me.”"
Mark,9,20,"They brought the boy, and as soon as the demon saw Jesus, it made the boy shake all over. He fell down and began rolling on the ground and foaming at the mouth."
Mark,9,21,"Jesus asked the boy's father, “How long has he been like this?” The man answered, “Ever since he was a child."
Mark,9,22,The demon has often tried to kill him by throwing him into a fire or into water. Please have pity and help us if you can!”
Mark,9,23,"Jesus replied, “Why do you say ‘if you can’? Anything is possible for someone who has faith!”"
Mark,9,24,"Straight away the boy's father shouted, “I do have faith! Please help me to have even more.”"
Mark,9,25,"When Jesus saw that a crowd was gathering fast, he spoke sternly to the evil spirit that had kept the boy from speaking or hearing. He said, “I order you to come out of the boy! Don't ever bother him again.”"
Mark,9,26,"The spirit screamed and made the boy shake all over. Then it went out of him. The boy looked dead, and almost everyone said he was."
Mark,9,27,But Jesus took hold of his hand and helped him stand up.
Mark,9,28,"After Jesus and the disciples had gone back home and were alone, they asked him, “Why couldn't we force out that demon?”"
Mark,9,29,"Jesus answered, “Only prayer can force out that kind of demon.”"
Mark,9,30,"Jesus left with his disciples and started through Galilee. He did not want anyone to know about it,"
Mark,9,31,because he was teaching the disciples that the Son of Man would be handed over to people who would kill him. But three days later he would rise to life.
Mark,9,32,"The disciples did not understand what Jesus meant, and they were afraid to ask."
Mark,9,33,"Jesus and his disciples went to his home in Capernaum. After they were inside the house, Jesus asked them, “What were you arguing about along the way?”"
Mark,9,34,"They had been arguing about which one of them was the greatest, and so they did not answer."
Mark,9,35,"After Jesus sat down and told the twelve disciples to gather around him, he said, “If you want the place of honour, you must become a slave and serve others!”"
Mark,9,36,"Then Jesus made a child stand near him. He put his arm around the child and said,"
Mark,9,37,"“When you welcome even a child because of me, you welcome me. And when you welcome me, you welcome the one who sent me.”"
Mark,9,38,"John said, “Teacher, we saw a man using your name to force demons out of people. But he wasn't one of us, and we told him to stop.”"
Mark,9,39,Jesus said to his disciples: Don't stop him! No one who performs miracles in my name is going to say something bad about me the next minute.
Mark,9,40,Anyone who isn't against us is for us.
Mark,9,41,"And anyone who gives you a cup of water in my name, just because you belong to me, will surely be rewarded."
Mark,9,42,It will be terrible for people who cause even one of my little followers to sin. Those people would be better off thrown into the sea with a heavy stone tied around their necks.
Mark,10,1,"After Jesus left, he went to Judea and then on to the other side of the River Jordan. Once again large crowds came to him, and as usual, he taught them."
Mark,10,2,Some Pharisees wanted to test Jesus. So they came up to him and asked if it was right for a man to divorce his wife.
Mark,10,3,"Jesus asked them, “What does the Law of Moses say about that?”"
Mark,10,4,"They answered, “Moses allows a man to write out divorce papers and send his wife away.”"
Mark,10,5,"Jesus replied, “Moses gave you this law because you are so heartless."
Mark,10,6,But in the beginning God made a man and a woman.
Mark,10,7,That's why a man leaves his father and mother and gets married.
Mark,10,8,"He becomes like one person with his wife. Then they are no longer two people, but one."
Mark,10,9,And no one should separate a couple that God has joined together.”
Mark,10,10,"When Jesus and his disciples were back in the house, they asked him about what he had said."
Mark,10,11,"He told them, “A man who divorces his wife and marries someone else is unfaithful to his wife."
Mark,10,12,A woman who divorces her husband and marries again is also unfaithful.”
Mark,10,13,Some people brought their children to Jesus so that he could bless them by placing his hands on them. But his disciples told the people to stop bothering him.
Mark,10,14,"When Jesus saw this, he became angry and said, “Let the children come to me! Don't try to stop them. People who are like these little children belong to the kingdom of God."
Mark,10,15,"I promise you that you cannot get into God's kingdom, unless you accept it the way a child does.”"
Mark,10,16,Then Jesus took the children in his arms and blessed them by placing his hands on them.
Mark,10,17,"As Jesus was walking down a road, a man ran up to him. He knelt down, and asked, “Good teacher, what can I do to have eternal life?”"
Mark,10,18,"Jesus replied, “Why do you call me good? Only God is good."
Mark,10,19,You know the commandments. ‘Do not murder. Be faithful in marriage. Do not steal. Do not tell lies about others. Do not cheat. Respect your father and mother.’ ”
Mark,10,20,"The man answered, “Teacher, I have obeyed all these commandments since I was a young man.”"
Mark,10,21,"Jesus looked closely at the man. He liked him and said, “There's one thing you still need to do. Go and sell everything you own. Give the money to the poor, and you will have riches in heaven. Then come with me.”"
Mark,10,22,"When the man heard Jesus say this, he went away gloomy and sad because he was very rich."
Mark,10,23,"Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, “It's hard for rich people to get into God's kingdom!”"
Mark,10,24,"The disciples were shocked to hear this. So Jesus told them again, “It's terribly hard to get into God's kingdom!"
Mark,10,25,"In fact, it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to get into God's kingdom.”"
Mark,10,26,"Jesus' disciples were even more amazed. They asked each other, “How can anyone ever be saved?”"
Mark,10,27,"Jesus looked at them and said, “There are some things that people cannot do, but God can do anything.”"
Mark,10,28,"Peter replied, “Remember, we left everything to be your followers!”"
Mark,10,29,Jesus told him: You can be sure that anyone who gives up home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or land for me and for the good news
Mark,10,30,"will be rewarded. In this world they will be given a hundred times as many houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and pieces of land, though they will also be ill-treated. And in the world to come, they will have eternal life."
Mark,10,31,"But many who are now first will be last, and many who are now last will be first."
Mark,10,32,"The disciples were confused as Jesus led them towards Jerusalem, and his other followers were afraid. Once again, Jesus took the twelve disciples aside and told them what was going to happen to him. He said:"
Mark,10,33,"We are now on our way to Jerusalem where the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the Law of Moses. They will sentence him to death and hand him over to foreigners,"
Mark,10,34,who will make fun of him and spit on him. They will beat him and kill him. But three days later he will rise to life.
Mark,10,35,"James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came up to Jesus and asked, “Teacher, will you do us a favour?”"
Mark,10,36,"Jesus asked them what they wanted,"
Mark,10,37,"and they answered, “When you come into your glory, please let one of us sit at your right side and the other at your left.”"
Mark,10,38,"Jesus told them, “You don't really know what you're asking! Are you able to drink from the cup that I must soon drink from or be baptized as I must be baptized?”"
Mark,10,39,"“Yes, we are!” James and John answered. Then Jesus replied, “You certainly will drink from the cup from which I must drink. And you will be baptized just as I must!"
Mark,10,40,But it isn't for me to say who will sit at my right side and at my left. That is for God to decide.”
Mark,10,41,"When the ten other disciples heard this, they were angry with James and John."
Mark,10,42,But Jesus called the disciples together and said: You know that those foreigners who call themselves kings like to order their people around. And their great leaders have full power over the people they rule.
Mark,10,43,"But don't act like them. If you want to be great, you must be the servant of all the others."
Mark,10,44,"And if you want to be first, you must be everyone's slave."
Mark,10,45,"The Son of Man did not come to be a slave master, but a slave who will give his life to rescue many people."
Mark,10,46,"Jesus and his disciples went to Jericho. And as they were leaving, they were followed by a large crowd. A blind beggar called Bartimaeus son of Timaeus was sitting beside the road."
Mark,10,47,"When he heard that it was Jesus from Nazareth, he shouted, “Jesus, Son of David, have pity on me!”"
Mark,10,48,"Many people told the man to stop, but he shouted even louder, “Son of David, have pity on me!”"
Mark,10,49,"Jesus stopped and said, “Call him over!” They called out to the blind man and said, “Don't be afraid! Come on! He is calling for you.”"
Mark,10,50,The man threw off his coat as he jumped up and ran to Jesus.
Mark,10,51,"Jesus asked, “What do you want me to do for you?” The blind man answered, “Master, I want to see!”"
Mark,10,52,"Jesus told him, “You may go. Your eyes are healed because of your faith.” Straight away the man could see, and he went down the road with Jesus."
Mark,11,1,"Jesus and his disciples reached Bethphage and Bethany near the Mount of Olives. When they were getting close to Jerusalem, Jesus sent two of them on ahead."
Mark,11,2,"He told them, “Go into the next village. As soon as you enter it, you will find a young donkey that has never been ridden. Untie the donkey and bring it here."
Mark,11,3,"If anyone asks why you are doing that, say, ‘The Lord needs it and will soon bring it back.’ ”"
Mark,11,4,"The disciples left and found the donkey tied near a door that faced the street. While they were untying it,"
Mark,11,5,"some of the people standing there asked, “Why are you untying the donkey?”"
Mark,11,6,"They told them what Jesus had said, and the people let them take it."
Mark,11,7,"The disciples led the donkey to Jesus. They put some of their clothes on its back, and Jesus got on."
Mark,11,8,"Many people spread clothes on the road, while others went to cut branches from the fields."
Mark,11,9,"In front of Jesus and behind him, people went along shouting, “Hooray! God bless the one who comes in the name of the Lord!"
Mark,11,10,God bless the coming kingdom of our ancestor David. Hooray for God in heaven above!”
Mark,11,11,"After Jesus had gone to Jerusalem, he went into the temple and looked around at everything. But since it was already late in the day, he went back to Bethany with the twelve disciples."
Mark,11,12,"When Jesus and his disciples left Bethany the next morning, he was hungry."
Mark,11,13,"From a distance Jesus saw a fig tree covered with leaves, and he went to see if there were any figs on the tree. But there were not any, because it wasn't the season for figs."
Mark,11,14,"So Jesus said to the tree, “Never again will anyone eat fruit from this tree!” The disciples heard him say this."
Mark,11,15,"After Jesus and his disciples reached Jerusalem, he went into the temple and began chasing out everyone who was selling and buying. He turned over the tables of the moneychangers and the benches of those who were selling doves."
Mark,11,16,Jesus would not let anyone carry things through the temple.
Mark,11,17,"Then he taught the people and said, “The Scriptures say, ‘My house should be called a place of worship for all nations.’ But you have made it a place where robbers hide!”"
Mark,11,18,"The chief priests and the teachers of the Law of Moses heard what Jesus said, and they started looking for a way to kill him. They were afraid of him, because the crowds were completely amazed at his teaching."
Mark,11,19,"That evening, Jesus and the disciples went outside the city."
Mark,11,20,"As the disciples walked past the fig tree the next morning, they noticed that it was completely dried up, roots and all."
Mark,11,21,"Peter remembered what Jesus had said to the tree. Then Peter said, “Teacher, look! The tree you put a curse on has dried up.”"
Mark,11,22,Jesus told his disciples: Have faith in God!
Mark,11,23,"If you have faith in God and don't doubt, you can tell this mountain to get up and jump into the sea, and it will."
Mark,11,24,"Everything you ask for in prayer will be yours, if you only have faith."
Mark,12,1,Jesus then told them this story: A farmer once planted a vineyard. He built a wall around it and dug a pit to crush the grapes in. He also built a lookout tower. Then he let his vineyard and left the country.
Mark,12,2,"When it was harvest time, he sent a servant to get his share of the grapes."
Mark,12,3,The tenants grabbed the servant. They beat him up and sent him away without a thing.
Mark,12,4,"The owner sent another servant, but the tenants beat him on the head and insulted him terribly."
Mark,12,5,"Then the man sent another servant, and they killed him. He kept sending servant after servant. They beat some of them and killed others."
Mark,12,6,"The owner had a son he loved very much. Finally, he sent his son to the tenants because he thought they would respect him."
Mark,12,7,"But they said to themselves, “Some day he will own this vineyard. Let's kill him! That way we can have it all for ourselves.”"
Mark,12,8,So they grabbed the owner's son and killed him. Then they threw his body out of the vineyard.
Mark,12,9,"Jesus asked, “What do you think the owner of the vineyard will do? He will come and kill those tenants and let someone else have his vineyard."
Mark,12,10,"Surely you know that the Scriptures say, ‘The stone that the builders tossed aside is now the most important stone of all."
Mark,12,11,"This is something the Lord has done, and it is amazing to us.’ ”"
Mark,12,12,"The leaders knew that Jesus was really talking about them, and they wanted to arrest him. But because they were afraid of the crowd, they let him alone and left."
Mark,12,13,The Pharisees got together with Herod's followers. Then they sent some men to trick Jesus into saying something wrong.
Mark,12,14,"They went to him and said, “Teacher, we know that you are honest. You treat everyone with the same respect, no matter who they are. And you teach the truth about what God wants people to do. Tell us, should we pay taxes to the Emperor or not?”"
Mark,12,15,"Jesus knew what they were up to, and he said, “Why are you trying to test me? Show me a coin!”"
Mark,12,16,"They brought him a silver coin, and he asked, “Whose picture and name are on it?” “The Emperor's,” they answered."
Mark,12,17,"Then Jesus told them, “Give the Emperor what belongs to him and give God what belongs to God.” The men were amazed at Jesus."
Mark,12,18,The Sadducees did not believe that people would rise to life after death. So some of them came to Jesus and said:
Mark,12,19,"Teacher, Moses wrote that if a married man dies and has no children, his brother should marry the widow. Their first son would then be thought of as the son of the dead brother."
Mark,12,20,"There were once seven brothers. The first one married, but died without having any children."
Mark,12,21,"The second brother married his brother's widow, and he also died without having children. The same thing happened to the third brother,"
Mark,12,22,and finally to all seven brothers. At last the woman died.
Mark,12,23,"When God raises people from death, whose wife will this woman be? After all, she had been married to all seven brothers."
Mark,12,24,Jesus answered: You are completely wrong! You don't know what the Scriptures teach. And you don't know anything about the power of God.
Mark,12,25,"When God raises people to life, they won't marry. They will be like the angels in heaven."
Mark,12,26,"You know about people being raised to life. You know that in the story about Moses and the burning bush, God said, “I am the God worshipped by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”"
Mark,12,27,"He isn't the God of the dead, but of the living. You Sadducees are all wrong."
Mark,12,28,"One of the teachers of the Law of Moses came up while Jesus and the Sadducees were arguing. When he heard Jesus give a good answer, he asked him, “What is the most important commandment?”"
Mark,12,29,"Jesus answered, “The most important one says: ‘People of Israel, you have only one Lord and God."
Mark,12,30,"You must love him with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength.’"
Mark,12,31,The second most important commandment says: ‘Love others as much as you love yourself.’ No other commandment is more important than these.”
Mark,12,32,"The man replied, “Teacher, you are certainly right to say there is only one God."
Mark,12,33,"It is also true that we must love God with all our heart, mind, and strength, and that we must love others as much as we love ourselves. These commandments are more important than all the sacrifices and offerings that we could possibly make.”"
Mark,12,34,"When Jesus saw that the man had given a sensible answer, he told him, “You are not far from God's kingdom.” After this, no one dared ask Jesus any more questions."
Mark,12,35,"As Jesus was teaching in the temple, he said, “How can the teachers of the Law of Moses say that the Messiah will come from the family of King David?"
Mark,12,36,"The Holy Spirit led David to say, ‘The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at my right side until I make your enemies into a footstool for you.’"
Mark,12,37,"If David called the Messiah his Lord, how can the Messiah be his son?” The large crowd enjoyed listening to Jesus teach."
Mark,12,38,"As Jesus was teaching, he said: Guard against the teachers of the Law of Moses! They love to walk around in long robes and be greeted in the market."
Mark,12,39,They like the front seats in the meeting places and the best seats at banquets.
Mark,12,40,But they cheat widows out of their homes and pray long prayers just to show off. They will be punished most of all.
Mark,12,41,Jesus was sitting in the temple near the offering box and watching people put in their gifts. He noticed that many rich people were giving a lot of money.
Mark,12,42,"Finally, a poor widow came up and put in two coins that were worth only a few pennies."
Mark,12,43,Jesus told his disciples to gather around him. Then he said: I tell you that this poor widow has put in more than all the others.
Mark,12,44,Everyone else gave what they didn't need. But she is very poor and gave everything she had. Now she doesn't have a penny to live on.
Mark,13,1,"As Jesus was leaving the temple, one of his disciples said to him, “Teacher, look at these beautiful stones and wonderful buildings!”"
Mark,13,2,"Jesus replied, “Do you see these huge buildings? They will certainly be torn down! Not one stone will be left in place.”"
Mark,13,3,"Later, as Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives across from the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew came to him in private."
Mark,13,4,"They asked, “When will these things happen? What will be the sign that they are about to take place?”"
Mark,13,5,Jesus answered: Watch out and don't let anyone fool you!
Mark,13,6,Many will come and claim to be me. They will use my name and fool many people.
Mark,13,7,"When you hear about wars and threats of wars, don't be afraid. These things will have to happen first, but that isn't the end."
Mark,13,8,"Nations and kingdoms will go to war against each other. There will be earthquakes in many places, and people will starve to death. But this is just the beginning of troubles."
Mark,13,9,"Be on your guard! You will be taken to courts and beaten with whips in their meeting places. And because of me, you will have to stand before rulers and kings to tell about your faith."
Mark,13,10,"But before the end comes, the good news must be preached to all nations."
Mark,13,11,"When you are arrested, don't worry about what you will say. You will be given the right words when the time comes. But you will not really be the ones speaking. Your words will come from the Holy Spirit."
Mark,13,12,"Brothers and sisters will betray each other and have each other put to death. Parents will betray their own children, and children will turn against their parents and have them killed."
Mark,13,13,"Everyone will hate you because of me. But if you keep on being faithful right to the end, you will be saved."
Mark,13,14,"Some day you will see that “Horrible Thing” where it should not be. Everyone who reads this must try to understand! If you are living in Judea at that time, run to the mountains."
Mark,13,15,"If you are on the roof of your house, don't go inside to get anything."
Mark,13,16,"If you are out in the field, don't go back for your coat."
Mark,13,17,It will be an awful time for women who are expecting babies or nursing young children.
Mark,13,18,Pray that it won't happen in winter.
Mark,13,19,"This will be the worst time of suffering since God created the world, and nothing this terrible will ever happen again."
Mark,13,20,"If the Lord doesn't make the time shorter, no one will be left alive. But because of his chosen and special ones, he will make the time shorter."
Mark,13,21,"If someone should say, “Here is the Messiah!” or “There he is!” don't believe it."
Mark,13,22,False messiahs and false prophets will come and perform miracles and signs. They will even try to fool God's chosen ones.
Mark,13,23,But be on your guard! That's why I am telling you these things now.
Mark,13,24,"In those days, straight after that time of suffering, “The sun will become dark, and the moon will no longer shine."
Mark,13,25,"The stars will fall, and the powers in the sky will be shaken.”"
Mark,13,26,Then the Son of Man will be seen coming in the clouds with great power and glory.
Mark,13,27,He will send his angels to gather his chosen ones from all over the earth.
Mark,13,28,"Learn a lesson from a fig tree. When its branches sprout and start putting out leaves, you know summer is near."
Mark,13,29,"So when you see all these things happening, you will know that the time has almost come."
Mark,13,30,You can be sure that some of the people of this generation will still be alive when all this happens.
Mark,13,31,"The sky and the earth will not last for ever, but my words will."
Mark,13,32,"No one knows the day or the time. The angels in heaven don't know, and the Son himself doesn't know. Only the Father knows."
Mark,13,33,So watch out and be ready! You don't know when the time will come.
Mark,13,34,"It is like what happens when a man goes away for a while and places his servants in charge of everything. He tells each of them what to do, and he orders the guard to keep alert."
Mark,13,35,So be alert! You don't know when the master of the house will come back. It could be in the evening or at midnight or before dawn or in the morning.
Mark,13,36,"But if he comes suddenly, don't let him find you asleep."
Mark,13,37,I tell everyone just what I have told you. Be alert!
Mark,14,1,It was now two days before Passover and the Festival of Thin Bread. The chief priests and the teachers of the Law of Moses were secretly planning to have Jesus arrested and put to death.
Mark,14,2,"They were saying, “We must not do it during the festival, because the people will riot.”"
Mark,14,3,"Jesus was eating in Bethany at the home of Simon, who once had leprosy, when a woman came in with a very expensive bottle of sweet-smelling perfume. After breaking it open, she poured the perfume on Jesus' head."
Mark,14,4,"This made some of the guests angry, and they complained, “Why such a waste?"
Mark,14,5,We could have sold this perfume for more than three hundred silver coins and given the money to the poor!” So they started saying cruel things to the woman.
Mark,14,6,But Jesus said: Leave her alone! Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing for me.
Mark,14,7,"You will always have the poor with you. And whenever you want to, you can give to them. But you won't always have me here with you."
Mark,14,8,She has done all she could by pouring perfume on my body to prepare it for burial.
Mark,14,9,"You may be sure that wherever the good news is told all over the world, people will remember what she has done. And they will tell others."
Mark,14,10,Judas Iscariot was one of the twelve disciples. He went to the chief priests and offered to help them arrest Jesus.
Mark,14,11,"They were glad to hear this, and they promised to pay him. So Judas started looking for a good chance to betray Jesus."
Mark,14,12,"It was the first day of the Festival of Thin Bread, and the Passover lambs were being killed. Jesus' disciples asked him, “Where do you want us to prepare the Passover meal?”"
Mark,14,13,"Jesus said to two of the disciples, “Go into the city, where you will meet a man carrying a jar of water. Follow him,"
Mark,14,14,"and when he goes into a house, say to the owner, ‘Our teacher wants to know if you have a room where he can eat the Passover meal with his disciples.’"
Mark,14,15,The owner will take you upstairs and show you a large room furnished and ready for you to use. Prepare the meal there.”
Mark,14,16,The two disciples went into the city and found everything just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover meal.
Mark,15,1,"Early the next morning the chief priests, the nation's leaders, and the teachers of the Law of Moses met together with the whole Jewish council. They tied up Jesus and led him off to Pilate."
Mark,15,2,"He asked Jesus, “Are you the king of the Jews?” “Those are your words,” Jesus answered."
Mark,15,3,The chief priests brought many charges against Jesus.
Mark,15,4,"Then Pilate questioned him again, “Don't you have anything to say? Don't you hear what crimes they say you have done?”"
Mark,15,5,"But Jesus did not answer, and Pilate was amazed."
Mark,15,6,"During Passover, Pilate always freed one prisoner chosen by the people."
Mark,15,7,And at that time there was a prisoner named Barabbas. He and some others had been arrested for murder during a riot.
Mark,15,8,"The crowd now came and asked Pilate to set a prisoner free, just as he usually did."
Mark,15,9,"Pilate asked them, “Do you want me to free the king of the Jews?”"
Mark,15,10,Pilate knew that the chief priests had brought Jesus to him because they were jealous.
Mark,15,11,But the chief priests told the crowd to ask Pilate to free Barabbas.
Mark,15,12,"Then Pilate asked the crowd, “What do you want me to do with this man you say is the king of the Jews?”"
Mark,15,13,"They yelled, “Nail him to a cross!”"
Mark,15,14,"Pilate asked, “But what crime has he done?” “Nail him to a cross!” they yelled even louder."
Mark,15,15,Pilate wanted to please the crowd. So he set Barabbas free. Then he ordered his soldiers to beat Jesus with a whip and nail him to a cross.
Mark,15,16,The soldiers led Jesus inside the courtyard of the fortress and called together the rest of the troops.
Mark,15,17,"They put a purple robe on him, and on his head they placed a crown that they had made out of thorn branches."
Mark,15,18,"They made fun of Jesus and shouted, “Hey, you king of the Jews!”"
Mark,15,19,Then they beat him on the head with a stick. They spat on him and knelt down and pretended to worship him.
Mark,15,20,"When the soldiers had finished making fun of Jesus, they took off the purple robe. They put his own clothes back on him and led him off to be nailed to a cross."
Mark,15,21,"Simon from Cyrene happened to be coming in from a farm, and they forced him to carry Jesus' cross. Simon was the father of Alexander and Rufus."
Mark,15,22,"The soldiers took Jesus to Golgotha, which means “Place of a Skull”."
Mark,15,23,"There they gave him some wine mixed with a drug to ease the pain, but he refused to drink it."
Mark,15,24,They nailed Jesus to a cross and gambled to see who would get his clothes.
Mark,15,25,It was about nine o'clock in the morning when they nailed him to the cross.
Mark,15,26,"On it was a sign that told why he was nailed there. It read, “This is the King of the Jews.”"
Mark,16,1,"After the Sabbath, Mary Magdalene, Salome, and Mary the mother of James bought some spices to put on Jesus' body."
Mark,16,2,"Very early on Sunday morning, just as the sun was coming up, they went to the tomb."
Mark,16,3,"On their way, they were asking one another, “Who will roll the stone away from the entrance for us?”"
Mark,16,4,"But when they looked, they saw that the stone had already been rolled away. And it was a huge stone!"
Mark,16,5,"The women went into the tomb, and on the right side they saw a young man in a white robe sitting there. They were alarmed."
Mark,16,6,"The man said, “Don't be alarmed! You are looking for Jesus from Nazareth, who was nailed to a cross. God has raised him to life, and he isn't here. You can see the place where they put his body."
Mark,16,7,"Now go and tell his disciples, and especially Peter, that he will go ahead of you to Galilee. You will see him there, just as he told you.”"
Mark,16,8,"When the women ran from the tomb, they were confused and shaking all over. They were too afraid to tell anyone what had happened."
Mark,16,9,"Very early on the first day of the week, after Jesus had risen to life, he appeared to Mary Magdalene. Earlier he had forced seven demons out of her."
Mark,16,10,"She left and told his friends, who were crying and mourning."
Mark,16,11,"Even though they heard that Jesus was alive and that Mary had seen him, they would not believe it."
Mark,16,12,"Later, Jesus appeared in another form to two disciples, as they were on their way out of the city."
Mark,16,13,"But when these disciples told what had happened, the others would not believe."
Mark,16,14,"Afterwards, Jesus appeared to his eleven disciples as they were eating. He scolded them because they were too stubborn to believe the ones who had seen him after he had been raised to life."
Mark,16,15,Then he told them: Go and preach the good news to everyone in the world.
Mark,16,16,Anyone who believes me and is baptized will be saved. But anyone who refuses to believe me will be condemned.
Mark,16,17,"Everyone who believes me will be able to do wonderful things. By using my name they will force out demons, and they will speak new languages."
Mark,16,18,They will handle snakes and will drink poison and not be hurt. They will also heal sick people by placing their hands on them.
Mark,16,19,"After the Lord Jesus had said these things to the disciples, he was taken back up to heaven where he sat down at the right side of God."
Mark,16,20,"Then the disciples left and preached everywhere. The Lord was with them, and the miracles they performed proved that their message was true."
Luke,1,1,Many people have tried to tell the story of what God has done among us.
Luke,1,2,They wrote what we had been told by the ones who were there in the beginning and saw what happened.
Luke,1,3,"So I made a careful study of everything and then decided to write and tell you exactly what took place. Honourable Theophilus,"
Luke,1,4,I have done this to let you know the truth about what you have heard.
Luke,1,5,"When Herod was king of Judea, there was a priest called Zechariah from the priestly group of Abijah. His wife Elizabeth was from the family of Aaron."
Luke,1,6,Both of them were good people and pleased the Lord God by obeying all that he had commanded.
Luke,1,7,"But they did not have children. Elizabeth could not have any, and both Zechariah and Elizabeth were already old."
Luke,1,8,"One day Zechariah's group of priests were on duty, and he was serving God as a priest."
Luke,1,9,"According to the custom of the priests, he had been chosen to go into the Lord's temple that day and to burn incense,"
Luke,1,10,while the people stood outside praying.
Luke,1,11,All at once an angel from the Lord appeared to Zechariah at the right side of the altar.
Luke,1,12,Zechariah was confused and afraid when he saw the angel.
Luke,1,13,"But the angel told him: Don't be afraid, Zechariah! God has heard your prayers. Your wife Elizabeth will have a son, and you must name him John."
Luke,1,14,"His birth will make you very happy, and many people will be glad."
Luke,1,15,"Your son will be a great servant of the Lord. He must never drink wine or beer, and the power of the Holy Spirit will be with him from the time he is born."
Luke,1,16,John will lead many people in Israel to turn back to the Lord their God.
Luke,1,17,"He will go ahead of the Lord with the same power and spirit that Elijah had. And because of John, parents will be more thoughtful of their children. And people who now disobey God will begin to think as they ought to. That is how John will get people ready for the Lord."
Luke,1,18,"Zechariah said to the angel, “How will I know this is going to happen? My wife and I are both very old.”"
Luke,1,19,"The angel answered, “I am Gabriel, God's servant, and I was sent to tell you this good news."
Luke,1,20,You have not believed what I have said. So you will not be able to say a thing until all this happens. But everything will take place when it is supposed to.”
Luke,1,21,The crowd was waiting for Zechariah and kept wondering why he was staying so long in the temple.
Luke,1,22,"When he did come out, he could not speak, and they knew he had seen a vision. He motioned to them with his hands, but did not say a thing."
Luke,1,23,"When Zechariah's time of service in the temple was over, he went home."
Luke,1,24,"Soon after that, his wife was expecting a baby, and for five months she did not leave the house. She said to herself,"
Luke,1,25,“What the Lord has done for me will keep people from looking down on me.”
Luke,1,26,One month later God sent the angel Gabriel to the town of Nazareth in Galilee
Luke,1,27,with a message for a virgin named Mary. She was engaged to Joseph from the family of King David.
Luke,1,28,"The angel greeted Mary and said, “You are truly blessed! The Lord is with you.”"
Luke,1,29,Mary was confused by the angel's words and wondered what they meant.
Luke,1,30,"Then the angel told Mary, “Don't be afraid! God is pleased with you,"
Luke,1,31,and you will have a son. His name will be Jesus.
Luke,1,32,"He will be great and will be called the Son of God Most High. The Lord God will make him king, as his ancestor David was."
Luke,1,33,"He will rule the people of Israel for ever, and his kingdom will never end.”"
Luke,1,34,"Mary asked the angel, “How can this happen? I am not married!”"
Luke,1,35,"The angel answered, “The Holy Spirit will come down to you, and God's power will come over you. So your child will be called the holy Son of God."
Luke,1,36,"Your relative Elizabeth is also going to have a son, even though she is old. No one thought she could ever have a baby, but in three months she will have a son."
Luke,1,37,Nothing is impossible for God!”
Luke,1,38,"Mary said, “I am the Lord's servant! Let it happen as you have said.” And the angel left her."
Luke,1,39,A short time later Mary hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea.
Luke,1,40,"She went into Zechariah's home, where she greeted Elizabeth."
Luke,1,41,"When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, her baby moved within her. The Holy Spirit came upon Elizabeth."
Luke,1,42,Then in a loud voice she said to Mary: God has blessed you more than any other woman! He has also blessed the child you will have.
Luke,1,43,Why should the mother of my Lord come to me?
Luke,1,44,"As soon as I heard your greeting, my baby became happy and moved within me."
Luke,1,45,The Lord has blessed you because you believed that he will keep his promise.
Luke,1,46,"Mary said: With all my heart I praise the Lord,"
Luke,1,47,and I am glad because of God my Saviour.
Luke,1,48,"He cares for me, his humble servant. From now on, all people will say God has blessed me."
Luke,1,49,"God All-Powerful has done great things for me, and his name is holy."
Luke,1,50,He always shows mercy to everyone who worships him.
Luke,1,51,The Lord has used his powerful arm to scatter those who are proud.
Luke,1,52,He drags strong rulers from their thrones and puts humble people in places of power.
Luke,1,53,"God gives the hungry good things to eat, and sends the rich away with nothing."
Luke,1,54,He helps his servant Israel and is always merciful to his people.
Luke,1,55,"The Lord made this promise to our ancestors, to Abraham and his family for ever!"
Luke,1,56,Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months. Then she went back home.
Luke,1,57,"When Elizabeth's son was born,"
Luke,1,58,"her neighbours and relatives heard how kind the Lord had been to her, and they too were glad."
Luke,1,59,"Eight days later they did for the child what the Law of Moses commands. They were going to name him Zechariah, after his father."
Luke,1,60,"But Elizabeth said, “No! His name is John.”"
Luke,1,61,"The people argued, “No one in your family has ever been named John.”"
Luke,1,62,So they motioned to Zechariah to find out what he wanted to name his son.
Luke,1,63,"Zechariah asked for a writing tablet. Then he wrote, “His name is John.” Everyone was amazed."
Luke,1,64,Straight away Zechariah started speaking and praising God.
Luke,1,65,"All the neighbours were frightened because of what had happened, and everywhere in the hill country people kept talking about these things."
Luke,1,66,Everyone who heard about this wondered what this child would grow up to be. They knew that the Lord was with him.
Luke,1,67,"The Holy Spirit came upon Zechariah, and he began to speak:"
Luke,1,68,"Praise the Lord, the God of Israel! He has come to save his people."
Luke,1,69,Our God has given us a mighty Saviour from the family of David his servant.
Luke,1,70,Long ago the Lord promised by the words of his holy prophets
Luke,1,71,to save us from our enemies and from everyone who hates us.
Luke,1,72,God said he would be kind to our people and keep his sacred promise.
Luke,1,73,He told our ancestor Abraham
Luke,1,74,"that he would rescue us from our enemies. Then we could serve him without fear,"
Luke,1,75,by being holy and good as long as we live.
Luke,1,76,"You, my son, will be called a prophet of God in heaven above. You will go ahead of the Lord to get everything ready for him."
Luke,1,77,You will tell his people that they can be saved when their sins are forgiven.
Luke,1,78,God's love and kindness will shine upon us like the sun that rises in the sky.
Luke,1,79,On us who live in the dark shadow of death this light will shine to guide us into a life of peace.
Luke,1,80,"As John grew up, God's Spirit gave him great power. John lived in the desert until the time he was sent to the people of Israel."
Luke,2,1,About that time Emperor Augustus gave orders for the names of all the people to be listed in record books.
Luke,2,2,These first records were made when Quirinius was governor of Syria.
Luke,2,3,Everyone had to go to their own home town to be listed.
Luke,2,4,"So Joseph had to leave Nazareth in Galilee and go to Bethlehem in Judea. Long ago Bethlehem had been King David's home town, and Joseph went there because he was from David's family."
Luke,2,5,"Mary was engaged to Joseph and travelled with him to Bethlehem. She was soon going to have a baby,"
Luke,2,6,"and while they were there,"
Luke,2,7,"she gave birth to her firstborn son. She dressed him in baby clothes and laid him on a bed of hay, because there was no room for them in the inn."
Luke,2,8,That night in the fields near Bethlehem some shepherds were guarding their sheep.
Luke,2,9,"All at once an angel came down to them from the Lord, and the brightness of the Lord's glory flashed around them. The shepherds were frightened."
Luke,2,10,"But the angel said, “Don't be afraid! I have good news for you, which will make everyone happy."
Luke,2,11,This very day in King David's home town a Saviour was born for you. He is Christ the Lord.
Luke,2,12,"You will know who he is, because you will find him dressed in baby clothes and lying on a bed of hay.”"
Luke,2,13,Suddenly many other angels came down from heaven and joined in praising God. They said:
Luke,2,14,“Praise God in heaven! Peace on earth to everyone who pleases God.”
Luke,2,15,"After the angels had left and gone back to heaven, the shepherds said to each other, “Let's go to Bethlehem and see what the Lord has told us about.”"
Luke,2,16,"They hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and they saw the baby lying on a bed of hay."
Luke,2,17,"When the shepherds saw Jesus, they told his parents what the angel had said about him."
Luke,2,18,Everyone listened and was surprised.
Luke,2,19,But Mary kept thinking about all this and wondering what it meant.
Luke,2,20,"As the shepherds returned to their sheep, they were praising God and saying wonderful things about him. Everything they had seen and heard was just as the angel had said."
Luke,2,21,"Eight days later Jesus' parents did for him what the Law of Moses commands. And they named him Jesus, just as the angel had told Mary when he promised she would have a baby."
Luke,2,22,"The time came for Mary and Joseph to do what the Law of Moses says a mother is supposed to do after her baby is born. They took Jesus to the temple in Jerusalem and presented him to the Lord,"
Luke,2,23,"just as the Law of the Lord says, “Each firstborn baby boy belongs to the Lord.”"
Luke,2,24,"The Law of the Lord also says that parents have to offer a sacrifice, giving at least a pair of doves or two young pigeons. So that is what Mary and Joseph did."
Luke,2,25,At this time a man named Simeon was living in Jerusalem. Simeon was a good man. He loved God and was waiting for God to save the people of Israel. God's Spirit came to him
Luke,2,26,and told him that he would not die until he had seen Christ the Lord.
Luke,2,27,"When Mary and Joseph brought Jesus to the temple to do what the Law of Moses says should be done for a new baby, the Spirit told Simeon to go into the temple."
Luke,2,28,"Simeon took the baby Jesus in his arms and praised God,"
Luke,2,29,"“Lord, I am your servant, and now I can die in peace, because you have kept your promise to me."
Luke,2,30,"With my own eyes I have seen what you have done to save your people,"
Luke,2,31,and foreign nations will also see this.
Luke,2,32,"Your mighty power is a light for all nations, and it will bring honour to your people Israel.”"
Luke,2,33,Jesus' parents were surprised at what Simeon had said.
Luke,2,34,"Then he blessed them and told Mary, “This child of yours will cause many people in Israel to fall and others to stand. The child will be like a warning sign. Many people will reject him,"
Luke,2,35,"and you, Mary, will suffer as though you had been stabbed by a dagger. But all this will show what people are really thinking.”"
Luke,2,36,"The prophet Anna was also there in the temple. She was the daughter of Phanuel from the tribe of Asher, and she was very old. In her youth she had been married for seven years, but her husband had died."
Luke,2,37,And now she was eighty-four years old. Night and day she served God in the temple by praying and often going without eating.
Luke,2,38,At that time Anna came in and praised God. She spoke about the child Jesus to everyone who hoped for Jerusalem to be set free.
Luke,2,39,"After Joseph and Mary had done everything that the Law of the Lord commands, they returned home to Nazareth in Galilee."
Luke,2,40,"The child Jesus grew. He became strong and wise, and God blessed him."
Luke,2,41,Every year Jesus' parents went to Jerusalem for Passover.
Luke,2,42,"And when Jesus was twelve years old, they all went there as usual for the celebration."
Luke,2,43,"After Passover his parents left, but they did not know that Jesus had stayed on in the city."
Luke,2,44,"They thought he was travelling with some other people, and they went a whole day before they started looking for him."
Luke,2,45,"When they could not find him with their relatives and friends, they went back to Jerusalem and started looking for him there."
Luke,2,46,"Three days later they found Jesus sitting in the temple, listening to the teachers and asking them questions."
Luke,2,47,Everyone who heard him was surprised at how much he knew and at the answers he gave.
Luke,2,48,"When his parents found him, they were amazed. His mother said, “Son, why have you done this to us? Your father and I have been very worried, and we have been searching for you!”"
Luke,2,49,"Jesus answered, “Why did you have to look for me? Didn't you know that I would be in my Father's house?”"
Luke,2,50,But they did not understand what he meant.
Luke,2,51,Jesus went back to Nazareth with his parents and obeyed them. His mother kept on thinking about all that had happened.
Luke,2,52,"Jesus became wise, and he grew strong. God was pleased with him and so were the people."
Luke,3,1,"For fifteen years Emperor Tiberius had ruled that part of the world. Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was the ruler of Galilee. Herod's brother, Philip, was the ruler in the countries of Iturea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias was the ruler of Abilene."
Luke,3,2,"Annas and Caiaphas were the Jewish high priests. At that time God spoke to Zechariah's son John, who was living in the desert."
Luke,3,3,"So John went along the Jordan Valley, telling the people, “Turn back to God and be baptized! Then your sins will be forgiven.”"
Luke,3,4,"Isaiah the prophet wrote about John when he said, “In the desert someone is shouting, ‘Get the road ready for the Lord! Make a straight path for him."
Luke,3,5,Fill up every valley and level every mountain and hill. Straighten the crooked paths and smooth out the rough roads.
Luke,3,6,Then everyone will see the saving power of God.’ ”
Luke,3,7,"Crowds of people came out to be baptized, but John said to them, “You snakes! Who warned you to run from the coming judgment?"
Luke,3,8,Do something to show that you really have given up your sins. Don't start saying that you belong to Abraham's family. God can turn these stones into children for Abraham.
Luke,3,9,An axe is ready to cut the trees down at their roots. Any tree that doesn't produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into a fire.”
Luke,3,10,"The crowds asked John, “What should we do?”"
Luke,3,11,"John told them, “If you have two coats, give one to someone who doesn't have any. If you have food, share it with someone else.”"
Luke,3,12,"When tax collectors came to be baptized, they asked John, “Teacher, what should we do?”"
Luke,3,13,"John told them, “Don't make people pay more than they owe.”"
Luke,3,14,"Some soldiers asked him, “And what about us? What do we have to do?” John told them, “Don't force people to pay money to make you leave them alone. Be satisfied with your pay.”"
Luke,3,15,"Everyone became excited and wondered, “Could John be the Messiah?”"
Luke,3,16,"John said, “I am just baptizing with water. But someone more powerful is going to come, and I am not good enough even to untie his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire."
Luke,3,17,"His threshing fork is in his hand, and he is ready to separate the wheat from the husks. He will store the wheat in his barn and burn the husks with a fire that never goes out.”"
Luke,3,18,In many different ways John preached the good news to the people.
Luke,3,19,"But to Herod the ruler, he said, “It was wrong for you to take Herodias, your brother's wife.” John also said that Herod had done many other bad things."
Luke,3,20,"Finally, Herod put John in jail, and this was the worst thing he had done."
Luke,3,21,"While everyone else was being baptized, Jesus himself was baptized. Then as he prayed, the sky opened up,"
Luke,3,22,"and the Holy Spirit came down upon him in the form of a dove. A voice from heaven said, “You are my own dear Son, and I am pleased with you.”"
Luke,3,23,"When Jesus began to preach, he was about thirty years old. Everyone thought he was the son of Joseph. But his family went back through Heli,"
Luke,3,24,"Matthat, Levi, Melchi, Jannai, Joseph,"
Luke,3,25,"Mattathias, Amos, Nahum, Esli, Naggai,"
Luke,3,26,"Maath, Mattathias, Semein, Josech, Joda;"
Luke,3,27,"Joanan, Rhesa, Zerubbabel, Shealtiel, Neri,"
Luke,3,28,"Melchi, Addi, Cosam, Elmadam, Er,"
Luke,3,29,"Joshua, Eliezer, Jorim, Matthat, Levi;"
Luke,3,30,"Simeon, Judah, Joseph, Jonam, Eliakim,"
Luke,3,31,"Melea, Menna, Mattatha, Nathan, David,"
Luke,3,32,"Jesse, Obed, Boaz, Salmon, Nahshon;"

Luke,3,34,"Jacob, Isaac, Abraham, Terah, Nahor,"
Luke,3,35,"Serug, Reu, Peleg, Eber, Shelah;"
Luke,3,36,"Cainan, Arphaxad, Shem, Noah, Lamech,"
Luke,3,37,"Methuselah, Enoch, Jared, Mahalaleel, Kenan,"
Luke,3,38,"Enosh, and Seth. The family of Jesus went all the way back to Adam and then to God."
Luke,4,1,"When Jesus returned from the River Jordan, the power of the Holy Spirit was with him, and the Spirit led him into the desert."
Luke,4,2,"For forty days Jesus was tested by the devil, and during that time he went without eating. When it was all over, he was hungry."
Luke,4,3,"The devil said to Jesus, “If you are God's Son, tell this stone to turn into bread.”"
Luke,4,4,"Jesus answered, “The Scriptures say, ‘No one can live only on food.’ ”"
Luke,4,5,Then the devil led Jesus up to a high place and quickly showed him all the nations on earth.
Luke,4,6,"The devil said, “I will give all this power and glory to you. It has been given to me, and I can give it to anyone I want to."
Luke,4,7,"Just worship me, and you can have it all.”"
Luke,4,8,"Jesus answered, “The Scriptures say: ‘Worship the Lord your God and serve only him!’ ”"
Luke,4,9,"Finally, the devil took Jesus to Jerusalem and had him stand on top of the temple. The devil said, “If you are God's Son, jump off."
Luke,5,1,"Jesus was standing on the shore of Lake Gennesaret, teaching the people as they crowded around him to hear God's message."
Luke,5,2,Near the shore he saw two boats left there by some fishermen who had gone to wash their nets.
Luke,5,3,Jesus got into the boat that belonged to Simon and asked him to row it out a little way from the shore. Then Jesus sat down in the boat to teach the crowd.
Luke,5,4,"When Jesus had finished speaking, he told Simon, “Row the boat out into the deep water and let your nets down to catch some fish.”"
Luke,5,5,"“Master,” Simon answered, “we have worked hard all night long and have not caught a thing. But if you tell me to, I will let the nets down.”"
Luke,5,6,They did it and caught so many fish that their nets began ripping apart.
Luke,5,7,"Then they signalled for their partners in the other boat to come and help them. The men came, and together they filled the two boats so full that they both began to sink."
Luke,5,8,"When Simon Peter saw this happen, he knelt down in front of Jesus and said, “Lord, don't come near me! I am a sinner.”"
Luke,5,9,Peter and everyone with him were completely surprised at all the fish they had caught.
Luke,5,10,"His partners James and John, the sons of Zebedee, were surprised too. Jesus told Simon, “Don't be afraid! From now on you will bring in people instead of fish.”"
Luke,5,11,The men pulled their boats up on the shore. Then they left everything and went with Jesus.
Luke,5,12,"Jesus came to a town where there was a man who had leprosy. When the man saw Jesus, he knelt down on the ground in front of Jesus and begged, “Lord, you have the power to make me well, if only you wanted to.”"
Luke,5,13,"Jesus put his hand on him and said, “I want to! Now you are well.” At once the man's leprosy disappeared."
Luke,5,14,"Jesus told him, “Don't tell anyone about this, but go and show yourself to the priest. Offer a gift to the priest, just as Moses commanded, and everyone will know that you have been healed.”"
Luke,5,15,News about Jesus kept spreading. Large crowds came to listen to him teach and to be healed of their diseases.
Luke,5,16,But Jesus would often go to some place where he could be alone and pray.
Luke,5,17,"One day some Pharisees and experts in the Law of Moses sat listening to Jesus teach. They had come from every village in Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem. God had given Jesus the power to heal the sick,"
Luke,5,18,and some people came carrying a crippled man on a mat. They tried to take him inside the house and put him in front of Jesus.
Luke,5,19,"But because of the crowd, they could not get him to Jesus. So they went up on the roof, where they removed some tiles and let the mat down in the middle of the room."
Luke,5,20,"When Jesus saw how much faith they had, he said to the crippled man, “My friend, your sins are forgiven.”"
Luke,5,21,"The Pharisees and the experts began arguing, “Jesus must think he is God! Only God can forgive sins.”"
Luke,5,22,"Jesus knew what they were thinking, and he said, “Why are you thinking that?"
Luke,5,23,Is it easier for me to tell this crippled man that his sins are forgiven or to tell him to get up and walk?
Luke,5,24,"But now you will see that the Son of Man has the right to forgive sins here on earth.” Jesus then said to the man, “Get up! Pick up your mat and walk home.”"
Luke,5,25,"At once the man stood up in front of everyone. He picked up his mat and went home, giving thanks to God."
Luke,5,26,"Everyone was amazed and praised God. What they saw surprised them, and they said, “We have seen a great miracle today!”"
Luke,5,27,"Later, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the place for paying taxes. Jesus said to him, “Come with me.”"
Luke,5,28,Levi left everything and went with Jesus.
Luke,5,29,In his home Levi gave a big dinner for Jesus. Many tax collectors and other guests were also there.
Luke,5,30,"The Pharisees and some of their teachers of the Law of Moses grumbled to Jesus' disciples, “Why do you eat and drink with those tax collectors and other sinners?”"
Luke,5,31,"Jesus answered, “Healthy people don't need a doctor, but sick people do."
Luke,5,32,I didn't come to invite good people to turn to God. I came to invite sinners.”
Luke,5,33,"Some people said to Jesus, “John's followers often pray and go without eating, and so do the followers of the Pharisees. But your disciples never go without eating or drinking.”"
Luke,5,34,"Jesus told them, “The friends of a bridegroom don't go without eating while he is still with them."
Luke,5,35,But the time will come when he will be taken from them. Then they will go without eating.”
Luke,5,36,Jesus then told them these sayings: No one uses a new piece of cloth to patch old clothes. The patch would shrink and make the hole even bigger.
Luke,5,37,"No one pours new wine into old wineskins. The new wine would swell and burst the old skins. Then the wine would be lost, and the skins would be ruined."
Luke,5,38,New wine must be put only into new wineskins.
Luke,5,39,"No one wants new wine after drinking old wine. They say, “The old wine is better.”"
Luke,6,1,"One Sabbath when Jesus and his disciples were walking through some wheat fields, the disciples picked some wheat. They rubbed the husks off with their hands and started eating the grain."
Luke,6,2,"Some Pharisees said, “Why are you picking grain on the Sabbath? You're not supposed to do that!”"
Luke,6,3,"Jesus answered, “Surely you have read what David did when he and his followers were hungry."
Luke,6,4,"He went into the house of God and took the sacred loaves of bread that only priests were supposed to eat. He not only ate some himself, but even gave some to his followers.”"
Luke,6,5,"Jesus finished by saying, “The Son of Man is Lord over the Sabbath.”"
Luke,6,6,"On another Sabbath Jesus was teaching in a Jewish meeting place, and a man with a crippled right hand was there."
Luke,6,7,Some Pharisees and teachers of the Law of Moses kept watching Jesus to see if he would heal the man. They did this because they wanted to accuse Jesus of doing something wrong.
Luke,6,8,Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he told the man to stand up where everyone could see him. And the man stood up.
Luke,6,9,"Then Jesus asked, “On the Sabbath should we do good deeds or evil deeds? Should we save someone's life or destroy it?”"
Luke,6,10,"After he had looked around at everyone, he told the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He did, and his bad hand became completely well."
Luke,6,11,"The teachers and the Pharisees were furious and started saying to each other, “What can we do about Jesus?”"
Luke,6,12,"About that time Jesus went off to a mountain to pray, and he spent the whole night there."
Luke,6,13,The next morning he called his disciples together and chose twelve of them to be his apostles.
Luke,6,14,"One was Simon, and Jesus named him Peter. Another was Andrew, Peter's brother. There were also James, John, Philip, Bartholomew,"
Luke,6,15,"Matthew, Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus. The rest of the apostles were Simon, known as the Eager One,"
Luke,6,16,"Jude, who was the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who later betrayed Jesus."
Luke,6,17,"Jesus and his apostles went down from the mountain and came to some flat, level ground. Many other disciples were there to meet him. Large crowds of people from all over Judea, Jerusalem, and the coastal cities of Tyre and Sidon were there too."
Luke,6,18,These people had come to listen to Jesus and to be healed of their diseases. All who were troubled by evil spirits were also healed.
Luke,6,19,"Everyone was trying to touch Jesus, because power was going out from him and healing them all."
Luke,6,20,Jesus looked at his disciples and said: God will bless you people who are poor. His kingdom belongs to you!
Luke,6,21,God will bless you hungry people. You will have plenty to eat! God will bless you people who are crying. You will laugh!
Luke,6,22,"God will bless you when others hate you and won't have anything to do with you. God will bless you when people insult you and say cruel things about you, all because you are a follower of the Son of Man."
Luke,6,23,"Long ago your own people did these same things to the prophets. So when this happens to you, be happy and jump for joy! You will have a great reward in heaven."
Luke,6,24,But you rich people are in for trouble. You have already had an easy life!
Luke,6,25,You well-fed people are in for trouble. You will go hungry! You people who are laughing now are in for trouble. You are going to cry and weep!
Luke,6,26,You are in for trouble when everyone says good things about you. That is what your own people said about those prophets who told lies.
Luke,6,27,"This is what I say to all who will listen to me: Love your enemies, and be good to everyone who hates you."
Luke,6,28,"Ask God to bless anyone who curses you, and pray for everyone who is cruel to you."
Luke,6,29,"If someone slaps you on one cheek, don't stop that person from slapping you on the other cheek. If someone wants to take your coat, don't try to keep back your shirt."
Luke,6,30,Give to everyone who asks and don't ask people to return what they have taken from you.
Luke,6,31,Treat others just as you want to be treated.
Luke,6,32,"If you love only someone who loves you, will God praise you for that? Even sinners love people who love them."
Luke,6,33,"If you are kind only to someone who is kind to you, will God be pleased with you for that? Even sinners are kind to people who are kind to them."
Luke,6,34,"If you lend money only to someone you think will pay you back, will God be pleased with you for that? Even sinners lend to sinners because they think they will get it all back."
Luke,6,35,"But love your enemies and be good to them. Lend without expecting to be paid back. Then you will get a great reward, and you will be the true children of God in heaven. He is good even to people who are unthankful and cruel."
Luke,6,36,"Have pity on others, just as your Father has pity on you."
Luke,6,37,"Jesus said: Don't judge others, and God won't judge you. Don't be hard on others, and God won't be hard on you. Forgive others, and God will forgive you."
Luke,6,38,"If you give to others, you will be given a full amount in return. It will be packed down, shaken together, and spilling over into your lap. The way you treat others is the way you will be treated."
Luke,6,39,Jesus also used some sayings as he spoke to the people. He said: Can one blind person lead another blind person? Won't they both fall into a ditch?
Luke,6,40,"Are students better than their teacher? But when they are fully trained, they will be like their teacher."
Luke,6,41,You can see the speck in your friend's eye. But you don't notice the log in your own eye.
Luke,6,42,"How can you say, “My friend, let me take the speck out of your eye,” when you don't see the log in your own eye? You show-offs! First, get the log out of your own eye. Then you can see how to take the speck out of your friend's eye."
Luke,6,43,"A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot produce good fruit."
Luke,6,44,You can tell what a tree is like by the fruit it produces. You cannot pick figs or grapes from thorn bushes.
Luke,6,45,Good people do good things because of the good in their hearts. Bad people do bad things because of the evil in their hearts. Your words show what is in your heart.
Luke,6,46,"Why do you keep on saying that I am your Lord, when you refuse to do what I say?"
Luke,6,47,Anyone who comes and listens to me and obeys me
Luke,6,48,"is like someone who dug down deep and built a house on solid rock. When the flood came and the river rushed against the house, it was built so well that it didn't even shake."
Luke,6,49,"But anyone who hears what I say and doesn't obey me is like someone whose house wasn't built on solid rock. As soon as the river rushed against that house, it was smashed to pieces!"
Luke,7,1,"After Jesus had finished teaching the people, he went to Capernaum."
Luke,7,2,In that town an army officer's servant was sick and about to die. The officer liked this servant very much.
Luke,7,3,"And when he heard about Jesus, he sent some Jewish leaders to ask him to come and heal the servant."
Luke,7,4,"The leaders went to Jesus and begged him to do something. They said, “This man deserves your help!"
Luke,7,5,He loves our nation and even built us a meeting place.”
Luke,7,6,"So Jesus went with them. When Jesus wasn't far from the house, the officer sent some friends to tell him, “Lord, don't go to any trouble for me! I am not good enough for you to come into my house."
Luke,7,7,"And I am certainly not worthy to come to you. Just say the word, and my servant will get well."
Luke,7,8,"I have officers who give orders to me, and I have soldiers who take orders from me. I can say to one of them, ‘Go!’ and he goes. I can say to another, ‘Come!’ and he comes. I can say to my servant, ‘Do this!’ and he will do it.”"
Luke,7,9,"When Jesus heard this, he was so surprised that he turned and said to the crowd following him, “In all of Israel I've never found anyone with this much faith!”"
Luke,7,10,The officer's friends returned and found the servant well.
Luke,7,11,"Soon Jesus and his disciples were on their way to the town of Nain, and a big crowd was going along with them."
Luke,7,12,"As they came near the gate of the town, they saw people carrying out the body of a widow's only son. Many people from the town were walking along with her."
Luke,7,13,"When the Lord saw the woman, he felt sorry for her and said, “Don't cry!”"
Luke,7,14,"Jesus went over and touched the stretcher on which the people were carrying the dead boy. They stopped, and Jesus said, “Young man, get up!”"
Luke,7,15,The boy sat up and began to speak. Jesus then gave him back to his mother.
Luke,7,16,"Everyone was frightened and praised God. They said, “A great prophet is here with us! God has come to his people.”"
Luke,7,17,News about Jesus spread all over Judea and everywhere else in that part of the country.
Luke,8,1,"Soon after this, Jesus was going through towns and villages, telling the good news about God's kingdom. His twelve apostles were with him,"
Luke,8,2,"and so were some women who had been healed of evil spirits and all sorts of diseases. One of the women was Mary Magdalene, who once had seven demons in her."
Luke,8,3,"Joanna, Susanna, and many others had also used what they owned to help Jesus and his disciples. Joanna's husband Chuza was one of Herod's officials."
Luke,8,4,"When a large crowd from several towns had gathered around Jesus, he told them this story:"
Luke,8,5,"A farmer went out to scatter seed in a field. While the farmer was doing it, some of the seeds fell along the road and were stepped on or eaten by birds."
Luke,8,6,Other seeds fell on rocky ground and started growing. But the plants did not have enough water and soon dried up.
Luke,8,7,Some other seeds fell where thorn bushes grew up and choked the plants.
Luke,8,8,"The rest of the seeds fell on good ground where they grew and produced a hundred times as many seeds. When Jesus had finished speaking, he said, “If you have ears, pay attention!”"
Luke,8,9,Jesus' disciples asked him what the story meant.
Luke,8,10,"So he answered: I have explained the secrets about God's kingdom to you, but for others I can only use stories. These people look, but they don't see, and they hear, but they don't understand."
Luke,8,11,"This is what the story means: The seed is God's message,"
Luke,8,12,"and the seeds that fell along the road are the people who hear the message. But the devil comes and snatches the message out of their hearts, so that they will not believe and be saved."
Luke,8,13,"The seeds that fell on rocky ground are the people who gladly hear the message and accept it. But they don't have deep roots, and they believe only for a little while. As soon as life gets hard, they give up."
Luke,8,14,The seeds that fell among the thorn bushes are also people who hear the message. But they are so eager for riches and pleasures that they never produce anything.
Luke,8,15,Those seeds that fell on good ground are the people who listen to the message and keep it in good and honest hearts. They last and produce a harvest.
Luke,8,16,"No one lights a lamp and puts it under a bowl or under a bed. A lamp is always put on a lampstand, so that people who come into a house will see the light."
Luke,8,17,There is nothing hidden that will not be found. There is no secret that will not be well known.
Luke,8,18,"Pay attention to how you listen! Everyone who has something will be given more, but people who have nothing will lose what little they think they have."
Luke,8,19,"Jesus' mother and brothers went to see him, but because of the crowd they could not get near him."
Luke,8,20,"Someone told Jesus, “Your mother and brothers are standing outside and want to see you.”"
Luke,8,21,"Jesus answered, “My mother and my brothers are those people who hear and obey God's message.”"
Luke,8,22,"One day, Jesus and his disciples got into a boat, and he said, “Let's cross the lake.” They started out,"
Luke,8,23,"and while they were sailing across, he went to sleep. Suddenly a storm struck the lake, and the boat started sinking. They were in danger."
Luke,8,24,"So they went to Jesus and woke him up, “Master, Master! We are about to drown!” Jesus got up and ordered the wind and waves to stop. They obeyed, and everything was calm."
Luke,8,25,"Then Jesus asked the disciples, “Don't you have any faith?” But they were frightened and amazed. They said to each other, “Who is this? He can give orders to the wind and the waves, and they obey him!”"
Luke,8,26,Jesus and his disciples sailed across Lake Galilee and came to shore near the town of Gerasa.
Luke,8,27,"As Jesus was getting out of the boat, he was met by a man from that town. The man had demons in him. He had gone naked for a long time and no longer lived in a house, but in the graveyard."
Luke,8,28,"The man saw Jesus and screamed. He knelt down in front of him and shouted, “Jesus, Son of God in heaven, what do you want with me? I beg you not to torture me!”"
Luke,8,29,"He said this because Jesus had already told the evil spirit to go out of him. The man had often been attacked by the demon. And even though he had been bound with chains and leg irons and kept under guard, he smashed whatever bound him. Then the demon would force him out into lonely places."
Luke,8,30,"Jesus asked the man, “What is your name?” He answered, “My name is Lots.” He said this because there were ‘lots’ of demons in him."
Luke,8,31,"They begged Jesus not to send them to the deep pit, where they would be punished."
Luke,8,32,"A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. So the demons begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs, and Jesus let them go."
Luke,8,33,Then the demons left the man and went into the pigs. The whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and drowned.
Luke,8,34,"When the men taking care of the pigs saw this, they ran to spread the news in the town and on the farms."
Luke,8,35,"The people went out to see what had happened, and when they came to Jesus, they also found the man. The demons had gone out of him, and he was sitting there at the feet of Jesus. He had clothes on and was in his right mind. But the people were terrified."
Luke,8,36,Then all who had seen the man healed told about it.
Luke,8,37,"Everyone from around Gerasa begged Jesus to leave, because they were so frightened. When Jesus got into the boat to start back,"
Luke,8,38,"the man who had been healed begged to go with him. But Jesus sent him off and said,"
Luke,8,39,"“Go back home and tell everyone how much God has done for you.” The man then went all over town, telling everything that Jesus had done for him."
Luke,8,40,"Everyone had been waiting for Jesus, and when he came back, a crowd was there to welcome him."
Luke,8,41,"Just then the man in charge of the Jewish meeting place came and knelt down in front of Jesus. His name was Jairus, and he begged Jesus to come to his home"
Luke,8,42,"because his twelve-year-old child was dying. She was his only daughter. While Jesus was on his way, people were crowding all around him."
Luke,8,43,"In the crowd was a woman who had been bleeding for twelve years. She had spent everything she had on doctors, but none of them could make her well."
Luke,8,44,"As soon as she came up behind Jesus and barely touched his clothes, her bleeding stopped."
Luke,8,45,"“Who touched me?” Jesus asked. While everyone was denying it, Peter said, “Master, people are crowding all around and pushing you from every side.”"
Luke,8,46,"But Jesus answered, “Someone touched me, because I felt power going out from me.”"
Luke,8,47,"The woman knew that she could not hide, so she came trembling and knelt down in front of Jesus. She told everyone why she had touched him and that she had been healed straight away."
Luke,8,48,"Jesus said to the woman, “You are now well because of your faith. May God give you peace!”"
Luke,8,49,"While Jesus was speaking, someone came from Jairus' home and said, “Your daughter has died! Why bother the teacher any more?”"
Luke,8,50,"When Jesus heard this, he told Jairus, “Don't worry! Have faith, and your daughter will get well.”"
Luke,8,51,"Jesus went into the house, but he did not let anyone else go with him, except Peter, John, James, and the girl's father and mother."
Luke,8,52,"Everyone was crying and weeping for the girl. But Jesus said, “The child isn't dead. She is just asleep.”"
Luke,8,53,The people laughed at him because they knew she was dead.
Luke,8,54,"Jesus took hold of the girl's hand and said, “Child, get up!”"
Luke,8,55,She came back to life and got straight up. Jesus told them to give her something to eat.
Luke,8,56,"Her parents were surprised, but Jesus ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened."
Luke,9,1,Jesus called together his twelve apostles and gave them complete power over all demons and diseases.
Luke,9,2,Then he sent them to tell about God's kingdom and to heal the sick.
Luke,9,3,"He told them, “Don't take anything with you! Don't take a walking stick or a travelling bag or food or money or even a change of clothes."
Luke,9,4,"When you are welcomed into a home, stay there until you leave that town."
Luke,9,5,"If people won't welcome you, leave the town and shake the dust from your feet as a warning to them.”"
Luke,9,6,"The apostles left and went from village to village, telling the good news and healing people everywhere."
Luke,9,7,"Herod the ruler heard about all that was happening, and he was worried. Some people were saying that John the Baptist had come back to life."
Luke,9,8,Others were saying that Elijah had come or that one of the prophets from long ago had come back to life.
Luke,9,9,"But Herod said, “I had John's head cut off! Who is this I hear so much about?” Herod was eager to meet Jesus."
Luke,9,10,"The apostles came back and told Jesus everything they had done. He then took them with him to the village of Bethsaida, where they could be alone."
Luke,9,11,But a lot of people found out about this and followed him. Jesus welcomed them. He spoke to them about God's kingdom and healed everyone who was sick.
Luke,9,12,"Late in the afternoon the twelve apostles came to Jesus and said, “Send the crowd to the villages and farms around here. They need to find a place to stay and something to eat. There is nothing in this place. It is like a desert!”"
Luke,9,13,"Jesus answered, “You give them something to eat.” But they replied, “We have only five small loaves of bread and two fish. If we are going to feed all these people, we will have to go and buy food.”"
Luke,9,14,"There were about five thousand men in the crowd. Jesus said to his disciples, “Tell the people to sit in groups of fifty.”"
Luke,9,15,"They did this, and all the people sat down."
Luke,9,16,Jesus took the five loaves and the two fish. He looked up towards heaven and blessed the food. Then he broke the bread and fish and handed them to his disciples to give to the people.
Luke,9,17,Everyone ate all they wanted. What was left over filled twelve baskets.
Luke,9,18,"When Jesus was alone praying, his disciples came to him, and he asked them, “What do people say about me?”"
Luke,9,19,"They answered, “Some say that you are John the Baptist or Elijah or a prophet from long ago who has come back to life.”"
Luke,9,20,"Jesus then asked them, “But who do you say I am?” Peter answered, “You are the Messiah sent from God.”"
Luke,9,21,Jesus strictly warned his disciples not to tell anyone about this.
Luke,9,22,"Jesus told his disciples, “The nation's leaders, the chief priests, and the teachers of the Law of Moses will make the Son of Man suffer terribly. They will reject him and kill him, but three days later he will rise to life.”"
Luke,9,23,"Then Jesus said to all the people: If any of you want to be my followers, you must forget about yourself. You must take up your cross each day and follow me."
Luke,9,24,"If you want to save your life, you will destroy it. But if you give up your life for me, you will save it."
Luke,9,25,"What will you gain, if you own the whole world but destroy yourself or waste your life?"
Luke,9,26,"If you are ashamed of me and my message, the Son of Man will be ashamed of you when he comes in his glory and in the glory of his Father and the holy angels."
Luke,9,27,You can be sure that some of the people standing here will not die before they see God's kingdom.
Luke,9,28,"About eight days later Jesus took Peter, John, and James with him and went up on a mountain to pray."
Luke,9,29,"While he was praying, his face changed, and his clothes became shining white."
Luke,9,30,Suddenly Moses and Elijah were there speaking with him.
Luke,9,31,They appeared in heavenly glory and talked about all that Jesus' death in Jerusalem would mean.
Luke,9,32,Peter and the other two disciples had been sound asleep. All at once they woke up and saw how glorious Jesus was. They also saw the two men who were with him.
Luke,9,33,"Moses and Elijah were about to leave, when Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here! Let us make three shelters, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” But Peter did not know what he was talking about."
Luke,9,34,"While Peter was still speaking, a shadow from a cloud passed over them, and they were frightened as the cloud covered them."
Luke,9,35,"From the cloud a voice spoke, “This is my chosen Son. Listen to what he says!”"
Luke,9,36,"After the voice had spoken, Peter, John, and James saw only Jesus. For some time they kept quiet and did not say anything about what they had seen."
Luke,9,37,The next day Jesus and his three disciples came down from the mountain and were met by a large crowd.
Luke,9,38,"Just then someone in the crowd shouted, “Teacher, please do something for my son! He is my only child!"
Luke,9,39,"A demon often attacks him and makes him scream. It shakes him until he foams at the mouth, and it won't leave him until it has completely worn the boy out."
Luke,9,40,"I begged your disciples to force out the demon, but they couldn't do it.”"
Luke,9,41,"Jesus said to them, “You people are stubborn and don't have any faith! How much longer must I be with you? Why do I have to put up with you?” Then Jesus said to the man, “Bring your son to me.”"
Luke,9,42,"While the boy was being brought, the demon attacked him and made him shake all over. Jesus ordered the demon to stop. Then he healed the boy and gave him back to his father."
Luke,9,43,"Everyone was amazed at God's great power. While everyone was still amazed at what Jesus was doing, he said to his disciples,"
Luke,9,44,“Pay close attention to what I am telling you! The Son of Man will be handed over to his enemies.”
Luke,9,45,"But the disciples did not know what he meant. The meaning was hidden from them. They could not understand it, and they were afraid to ask."
Luke,9,46,Jesus' disciples were arguing about which one of them was the greatest.
Luke,9,47,"Jesus knew what they were thinking, and he had a child stand there beside him."
Luke,9,48,"Then he said to his disciples, “When you welcome even a child because of me, you welcome me. And when you welcome me, you welcome the one who sent me. Whichever one of you is the most humble is the greatest.”"
Luke,9,49,"John said, “Master, we saw a man using your name to force demons out of people. But we told him to stop, because he isn't one of us.”"
Luke,9,50,“Don't stop him!” Jesus said. “Anyone who isn't against you is for you.”
Luke,9,51,"Not long before it was time for Jesus to be taken up to heaven, he made up his mind to go to Jerusalem."
Luke,9,52,He sent some messengers on ahead to a Samaritan village to get things ready for him.
Luke,9,53,"But he was on his way to Jerusalem, so the people there refused to welcome him."
Luke,9,54,"When the disciples James and John saw what was happening, they asked, “Lord, do you want us to call down fire from heaven to destroy these people?”"
Luke,9,55,But Jesus turned and corrected them for what they had said.
Luke,9,56,Then they all went on to another village.
Luke,9,57,"Along the way someone said to Jesus, “I'll go anywhere with you!”"
Luke,9,58,"Jesus said, “Foxes have dens, and birds have nests, but the Son of Man doesn't have a place to call his own.”"
Luke,9,59,"Jesus told someone else to come with him. But the man said, “Lord, let me wait until I bury my father.”"
Luke,9,60,"Jesus answered, “Let the dead take care of the dead, while you go and tell about God's kingdom.”"
Luke,9,61,"Then someone said to Jesus, “I want to go with you, Lord, but first let me go back and take care of things at home.”"
Luke,9,62,"Jesus answered, “Anyone who starts ploughing and keeps looking back isn't worth a thing to God's kingdom!”"
Luke,10,1,Later the Lord chose seventy-two other followers and sent them out two by two to every town and village where he was about to go.
Luke,10,2,"He said to them: A large crop is in the fields, but there are only a few workers. Ask the Lord in charge of the harvest to send out workers to bring it in."
Luke,10,3,"Now go, but remember, I am sending you like lambs into a pack of wolves."
Luke,10,4,Don't take along a money bag or a travelling bag or sandals. And don't waste time greeting people on the road.
Luke,10,5,"As soon as you enter a home, say, “God bless this home with peace.”"
Luke,10,6,"If the people living there are peace-loving, your prayer for peace will bless them. But if they are not peace-loving, your prayer will return to you."
Luke,10,7,"Stay with the same family, eating and drinking whatever they give you, because workers are worth what they earn. Don't move around from house to house."
Luke,10,8,"If the people of a town welcome you, eat whatever they offer."
Luke,10,9,"Heal their sick and say, “God's kingdom will soon be here!”"
Luke,10,10,"But if the people of a town refuse to welcome you, go out into the street and say,"
Luke,10,11,“We are shaking the dust from our feet as a warning to you. And you can be sure that God's kingdom will soon be here!”
Luke,10,12,I tell you that on the day of judgment the people of Sodom will get off easier than the people of that town!
Luke,10,13,"You people of Chorazin are in for trouble! You people of Bethsaida are also in for trouble! If the miracles that took place in your towns had happened in Tyre and Sidon, the people there would have turned to God long ago. They would have dressed in sackcloth and put ashes on their heads."
Luke,10,14,On the day of judgment the people of Tyre and Sidon will get off easier than you will.
Luke,10,15,"People of Capernaum, do you think you will be honoured in heaven? Well, you will go down to hell!"
Luke,10,16,"My followers, whoever listens to you is listening to me. Anyone who says “No” to you is saying “No” to me. And anyone who says “No” to me is really saying “No” to the one who sent me."
Luke,10,17,"When the seventy-two followers returned, they were excited and said, “Lord, even the demons obeyed when we spoke in your name!”"
Luke,10,18,Jesus told them: I saw Satan fall from heaven like a flash of lightning.
Luke,10,19,I have given you the power to trample on snakes and scorpions and to defeat the power of your enemy Satan. Nothing can harm you.
Luke,10,20,But don't be happy because evil spirits obey you. Be happy that your names are written in heaven!
Luke,10,21,"At that same time, Jesus felt the joy that comes from the Holy Spirit, and he said: My Father, Lord of heaven and earth, I am grateful that you hid all this from wise and educated people and showed it to ordinary people. Yes, Father, that is what pleased you."
Luke,10,22,"My Father has given me everything, and he is the only one who knows the Son. The only one who really knows the Father is the Son. But the Son wants to tell others about the Father, so that they can know him too."
Luke,10,23,"Jesus then turned to his disciples and said to them in private, “You are really blessed to see what you see!"
Luke,10,24,Many prophets and kings were eager to see what you see and to hear what you hear. But I tell you that they did not see or hear.”
Luke,10,25,"An expert in the Law of Moses stood up and asked Jesus a question to see what he would say. “Teacher,” he asked, “what must I do to have eternal life?”"
Luke,10,26,"Jesus answered, “What is written in the Scriptures? How do you understand them?”"
Luke,10,27,"The man replied, “The Scriptures say, ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, strength, and mind.’ They also say, ‘Love your neighbours as much as you love yourself.’ ”"
Luke,10,28,"Jesus said, “You have given the right answer. If you do this, you will have eternal life.”"
Luke,10,29,"But the man wanted to show that he knew what he was talking about. So he asked Jesus, “Who are my neighbours?”"
Luke,10,30,"Jesus replied: As a man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, robbers attacked him and grabbed everything he had. They beat him up and ran off, leaving him half dead."
Luke,10,31,"A priest happened to be going down the same road. But when he saw the man, he walked by on the other side."
Luke,10,32,"Later a temple helper came to the same place. But when he saw the man who had been beaten up, he also went by on the other side."
Luke,10,33,"A man from Samaria then came travelling along that road. When he saw the man, he felt sorry for him"
Luke,10,34,"and went over to him. He treated his wounds with olive oil and wine and bandaged them. Then he put him on his own donkey and took him to an inn, where he took care of him."
Luke,10,35,"The next morning he gave the innkeeper two silver coins and said, “Please take care of the man. If you spend more than this on him, I will pay you when I return.”"
Luke,10,36,"Then Jesus asked, “Which one of these three people was a real neighbour to the man who was beaten up by robbers?”"
Luke,10,37,"The teacher answered, “The one who showed pity.” Jesus said, “Go and do the same!”"
Luke,10,38,"The Lord and his disciples were travelling along and came to a village. When they got there, a woman named Martha welcomed him into her home."
Luke,10,39,"She had a sister named Mary, who sat down in front of the Lord and was listening to what he said."
Luke,10,40,"Martha was worried about all that had to be done. Finally, she went to Jesus and said, “Lord, doesn't it bother you that my sister has left me to do all the work by myself? Tell her to come and help me!”"
Luke,10,41,"The Lord answered, “Martha, Martha! You are worried and upset about so many things,"
Luke,10,42,"but only one thing is necessary. Mary has chosen what is best, and it will not be taken away from her.”"
Luke,11,1,"When Jesus had finished praying, one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his followers to pray.”"
Luke,11,2,"So Jesus told them, “Pray in this way: ‘Father, help us to honour your name. Come and set up your kingdom."
Luke,11,3,Give us each day the food we need.
Luke,11,4,"Forgive our sins, as we forgive everyone who has done wrong to us. And keep us from being tempted.’ ”"
Luke,11,5,"Then Jesus went on to say: Suppose one of you goes to a friend in the middle of the night and says, “Let me borrow three loaves of bread."
Luke,11,6,"A friend of mine has dropped in, and I don't have a thing for him to eat.”"
Luke,11,7,"And suppose your friend answers, “Don't bother me! The door is bolted, and my children and I are in bed. I cannot get up to give you something.”"
Luke,11,8,"He may not get up and give you the bread, just because you are his friend. But he will get up and give you as much as you need, simply because you are not ashamed to keep on asking."
Luke,11,9,"So I tell you to ask and you will receive, search and you will find, knock and the door will be opened for you."
Luke,11,10,"Everyone who asks will receive, everyone who searches will find, and the door will be opened for everyone who knocks."
Luke,11,11,Which one of you fathers would give your hungry child a snake if the child asked for a fish?
Luke,11,12,Which one of you would give your child a scorpion if the child asked for an egg?
Luke,11,13,"As bad as you are, you still know how to give good gifts to your children. But your heavenly Father is even more ready to give the Holy Spirit to anyone who asks."
Luke,11,14,"Jesus forced a demon out of a man who could not talk. And after the demon had gone out, the man started speaking, and the crowds were amazed."
Luke,11,15,"But some people said, “He forces out demons by the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons!”"
Luke,11,16,Others wanted to put Jesus to the test. So they asked him to show them a sign from God.
Luke,11,17,"Jesus knew what they were thinking, and he said: A kingdom where people fight each other will end up in ruin. And a family that fights will break up."
Luke,11,18,"If Satan fights against himself, how can his kingdom last? Yet you say that I force out demons by the power of Beelzebul."
Luke,11,19,"If I use his power to force out demons, whose power do your own followers use to force them out? They are the ones who will judge you."
Luke,11,20,"But if I use God's power to force out demons, it proves that God's kingdom has already come to you."
Luke,11,21,"When a strong man arms himself and guards his home, everything he owns is safe."
Luke,11,22,"But if a stronger man comes and defeats him, he will carry off the weapons in which the strong man trusted. Then he will divide with others what he has taken."
Luke,11,23,"If you are not on my side, you are against me. If you don't gather in the crop with me, you scatter it."
Luke,11,24,"When an evil spirit leaves a person, it travels through the desert, looking for a place to rest. But when it doesn't find a place, it says, “I will go back to the home I left.”"
Luke,11,25,"When it gets there and finds the place clean and tidy,"
Luke,11,26,"it goes off and finds seven other evil spirits even worse than itself. They all come and make their home there, and that person ends up in a worse state than before."
Luke,11,27,"While Jesus was still talking, a woman in the crowd spoke up, “The woman who gave birth to you and nursed you is blessed!”"
Luke,11,28,"Jesus replied, “That's true, but the people who are really blessed are the ones who hear and obey God's message!”"
Luke,11,29,"As crowds were gathering around Jesus, he said: You people of today are evil! You keep looking for a sign from God. But what happened to Jonah is the only sign you will be given."
Luke,11,30,"Just as Jonah was a sign to the people of Nineveh, the Son of Man will be a sign to the people of today."
Luke,11,31,"When the judgment comes, the Queen of the South will stand there with you and condemn you. She travelled a long way to hear Solomon's wisdom, and yet here is something far greater than Solomon."
Luke,11,32,"The people of Nineveh will also stand there with you and condemn you. They turned to God when Jonah preached, and yet here is something far greater than Jonah."
Luke,11,33,"No one lights a lamp and then hides it or puts it under a clay pot. A lamp is put on a lampstand, so that everyone who comes into the house can see the light."
Luke,11,34,"Your eyes are the lamp for your body. When your eyes are good, you have all the light you need. But when your eyes are bad, everything is dark."
Luke,11,35,So be sure that your light isn't darkness.
Luke,11,36,"If you have light, and nothing is dark, then light will be everywhere, as when a lamp shines brightly on you."
Luke,11,37,"When Jesus finished speaking, a Pharisee invited him home for a meal. Jesus went and sat down to eat."
Luke,11,38,The Pharisee was surprised that he did not wash his hands before eating.
Luke,11,39,"So the Lord said to him: You Pharisees clean the outside of cups and dishes, but on the inside you are greedy and evil."
Luke,11,40,You fools! Didn't God make both the outside and the inside?
Luke,11,41,"If you would only give what you have to the poor, everything you do would please God."
Luke,11,42,"You Pharisees are in for trouble! You give God a tenth of the spices from your gardens, such as mint and rue. But you cheat people, and you don't love God. You should be fair and kind to others and still give a tenth to God."
Luke,11,43,"You Pharisees are in for trouble! You love the front seats in the meeting places, and you like to be greeted with honour in the market."
Luke,11,44,But you are in for trouble! You are like unmarked graves that people walk on without even knowing it.
Luke,11,45,"A teacher of the Law of Moses spoke up, “Teacher, you said cruel things about us.”"
Luke,11,46,"Jesus replied: You teachers are also in for trouble! You load people down with heavy burdens, but you won't lift a finger to help them carry the loads."
Luke,11,47,"Yes, you are really in for trouble. You build monuments to honour the prophets your own people murdered long ago."
Luke,11,48,"You must think that was the right thing for your people to do, or else you would not have built monuments for the prophets they murdered."
Luke,11,49,"Because of your evil deeds, the Wisdom of God said, “I will send prophets and apostles to you. But you will murder some and ill-treat others.”"
Luke,11,50,You people living today will be punished for all the prophets who have been murdered since the beginning of the world.
Luke,11,51,"This includes every prophet from the time of Abel to the time of Zechariah, who was murdered between the altar and the temple. You people will certainly be punished for all this."
Luke,11,52,"You teachers of the Law of Moses are really in for trouble! You carry the keys to the door of knowledge about God. But you never go in, and you keep others from going in."
Luke,11,53,"Jesus was about to leave, but the teachers and the Pharisees wanted to get even with him. They tried to make him say what he thought about other things,"
Luke,11,54,so that they could catch him saying something wrong.
Luke,12,1,"As thousands of people crowded around Jesus and were stepping on each other, he told his disciples: Be sure to guard against the dishonest teaching of the Pharisees! It is their way of fooling people."
Luke,12,2,"Everything that is hidden will be found out, and every secret will be known."
Luke,12,3,Whatever you say in the dark will be heard when it is day. Whatever you whisper in a closed room will be shouted from the housetops.
Luke,12,4,"My friends, don't be afraid of people. They can kill you, but after that, there is nothing else they can do."
Luke,12,5,"God is the one you must fear. Not only can he take your life, but he can throw you into hell. God is certainly the one you should fear!"
Luke,12,6,"Five sparrows are sold for just two pennies, but God doesn't forget a single one of them."
Luke,12,7,Even the hairs on your head are counted. So don't be afraid! You are worth much more than many sparrows.
Luke,12,8,"If you tell others that you belong to me, the Son of Man will tell God's angels that you are my followers."
Luke,12,9,"But if you reject me, you will be rejected in front of them."
Luke,12,10,"If you speak against the Son of Man, you can be forgiven, but if you speak against the Holy Spirit, you cannot be forgiven."
Luke,12,11,"When you are brought to trial in the Jewish meeting places or before rulers or officials, don't worry about how you will defend yourselves or what you will say."
Luke,12,12,At that time the Holy Spirit will tell you what to say.
Luke,12,13,"A man in a crowd said to Jesus, “Teacher, tell my brother to give me my share of what our father left us when he died.”"
Luke,12,14,"Jesus answered, “Who gave me the right to settle arguments between you and your brother?”"
Luke,12,15,"Then he said to the crowd, “Don't be greedy! Owning a lot of things won't make your life safe.”"
Luke,12,16,"So Jesus told them this story: A rich man's farm produced a big crop,"
Luke,12,17,"and he said to himself, “What can I do? I don't have a place large enough to store everything.”"
Luke,12,18,"Later, he said, “Now I know what I'll do. I'll tear down my barns and build bigger ones, where I can store all my grain and other goods."
Luke,12,19,"Then I'll say to myself, ‘You have stored up enough good things to last for years to come. Live it up! Eat, drink, and enjoy yourself.’ ”"
Luke,12,20,"But God said to him, “You fool! Tonight you will die. Then who will get what you have stored up?”"
Luke,12,21,"“This is what happens to people who store up everything for themselves, but are poor in the sight of God.”"
Luke,12,22,Jesus said to his disciples: I tell you not to worry about your life! Don't worry about having something to eat or wear.
Luke,12,23,Life is more than food or clothing.
Luke,12,24,"Look at the crows! They don't plant or harvest, and they don't have storehouses or barns. But God takes care of them. You are much more important than any birds."
Luke,12,25,Can worry make you live longer?
Luke,12,26,"If you don't have power over small things, why worry about everything else?"
Luke,12,27,Look how the wild flowers grow! They don't work hard to make their clothes. But I tell you that Solomon with all his wealth wasn't as well clothed as one of these flowers.
Luke,12,28,"God gives such beauty to everything that grows in the fields, even though it is here today and thrown into a fire tomorrow. Won't he do even more for you? You have such little faith!"
Luke,12,29,Don't keep worrying about having something to eat or drink.
Luke,12,30,Only people who don't know God are always worrying about such things. Your Father knows what you need.
Luke,12,31,"But put God's work first, and these things will be yours as well."
Luke,12,32,"My little group of disciples, don't be afraid! Your Father wants to give you the kingdom."
Luke,12,33,"Sell what you have and give the money to the poor. Make yourselves money bags that never wear out. Make sure your treasure is safe in heaven, where thieves cannot steal it and moths cannot destroy it."
Luke,12,34,Your heart will always be where your treasure is.
Luke,12,35,Be ready and keep your lamps burning
Luke,12,36,"just like those servants who wait up for their master to return from a wedding feast. As soon as he comes and knocks, they open the door for him."
Luke,12,37,Servants are fortunate if their master finds them awake and ready when he comes! I promise you that he will get ready and make his servants sit down so that he can serve them.
Luke,12,38,"Those servants are really fortunate if their master finds them ready, even though he comes late at night or early in the morning."
Luke,12,39,"You would not let a thief break into your home, if you knew when the thief was coming."
Luke,12,40,So always be ready! You don't know when the Son of Man will come.
Luke,12,41,"Peter asked Jesus, “Did you say this just for us or for everyone?”"
Luke,12,42,The Lord answered: Who are faithful and wise servants? Who are the ones the master will put in charge of giving the other servants their food supplies at the proper time?
Luke,12,43,Servants are fortunate if their master comes and finds them doing their job.
Luke,12,44,A servant who is always faithful will be put in charge of everything the master owns.
Luke,12,45,But suppose one of the servants thinks that the master won't return until late. Suppose that servant starts beating all the other servants and eats and drinks and gets drunk.
Luke,12,46,"If that happens, the master will come on a day and at a time when the servant least expects him. That servant will then be punished and thrown out with the servants who cannot be trusted."
Luke,12,47,"If servants are not ready or willing to do what their master wants them to do, they will be beaten hard."
Luke,12,48,"But servants who don't know what their master wants them to do will not be beaten so hard for doing wrong. If God has been generous with you, he will expect you to serve him well. But if he has been more than generous, he will expect you to serve him even better."
Luke,12,49,"I came to set fire to the earth, and I wish it were already on fire!"
Luke,12,50,I am going to be put to a hard test. And I will have to suffer a lot of pain until it is over.
Luke,12,51,Do you think that I came to bring peace to earth? No indeed! I came to make people choose sides.
Luke,12,52,"A family of five will be divided, with two of them against the other three."
Luke,12,53,"Fathers and sons will turn against one another, and mothers and daughters will do the same. Mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law will also turn against each other."
Luke,12,54,"Jesus said to all the people: As soon as you see a cloud coming up in the west, you say, “It's going to rain,” and it does."
Luke,12,55,"When the south wind blows, you say, “It's going to get hot,” and it does."
Luke,12,56,"Are you trying to fool someone? You can predict the weather by looking at the earth and sky, but you don't really know what's going on right now."
Luke,12,57,Why don't you understand the right thing to do?
Luke,12,58,"When someone accuses you of something, try to settle things before you are taken to court. If you don't, you will be dragged before the judge. Then the judge will hand you over to the jailer, and you will be locked up."
Luke,12,59,You won't get out until you have paid the last penny you owe.
Luke,13,1,About this same time Jesus was told that Pilate had given orders for some people from Galilee to be killed while they were offering sacrifices.
Luke,13,2,Jesus replied: Do you think that these people were worse sinners than everyone else in Galilee just because of what happened to them?
Luke,13,3,"Not at all! But you can be sure that if you don't turn back to God, every one of you will also be killed."
Luke,13,4,What about those eighteen people who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them? Do you think they were worse than everyone else in Jerusalem?
Luke,13,5,"Not at all! But you can be sure that if you don't turn back to God, every one of you will also die."
Luke,13,6,"Jesus then told them this story: A man had a fig tree growing in his vineyard. One day he went out to pick some figs, but he didn't find any."
Luke,13,7,"So he said to the gardener, “For three years I have come looking for figs on this tree, and I haven't found any yet. Chop it down! Why should it take up space?”"
Luke,13,8,"The gardener answered, “Master, leave it for another year. I'll dig around it and put some manure on it to make it grow."
Luke,13,9,"Perhaps it will have figs on it next year. If it doesn't, you can have it cut down.”"
Luke,13,10,"One Sabbath, Jesus was teaching in a Jewish meeting place,"
Luke,13,11,and a woman was there who had been crippled by an evil spirit for eighteen years. She was completely bent over and could not straighten up.
Luke,13,12,"When Jesus saw the woman, he called her over and said, “You are now well.”"
Luke,13,13,"He placed his hands on her, and at once she stood up straight and praised God."
Luke,13,14,"The man in charge of the meeting place was angry because Jesus had healed someone on the Sabbath. So he said to the people, “Each week has six days when we can work. Come and be healed on one of those days, but not on the Sabbath.”"
Luke,13,15,"The Lord replied, “Are you trying to fool someone? Won't any one of you untie your ox or donkey and lead it out to drink on a Sabbath?"
Luke,13,16,"This woman belongs to the family of Abraham, but Satan has kept her bound for eighteen years. Isn't it right to set her free on the Sabbath?”"
Luke,13,17,Jesus' words made his enemies ashamed. But everyone else in the crowd was happy about the wonderful things he was doing.
Luke,13,18,"Jesus said, “What is God's kingdom like? What can I compare it with?"
Luke,13,19,"It is like what happens when someone plants a mustard seed in a garden. The seed grows as big as a tree, and birds nest in its branches.”"
Luke,13,20,"Then Jesus said, “What can I compare God's kingdom with?"
Luke,13,21,"It is like what happens when a woman mixes yeast into three batches of flour. Finally, all the dough rises.”"
Luke,13,22,"As Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem, he taught the people in the towns and villages."
Luke,13,23,"Someone asked him, “Lord, are only a few people going to be saved?” Jesus answered:"
Luke,13,24,"Do all you can to go in by the narrow door! A lot of people will try to get in, but will not be able to."
Luke,13,25,"Once the owner of the house gets up and locks the door, you will be left standing outside. You will knock on the door and say, “Sir, open the door for us!” But the owner will answer, “I don't know a thing about you!”"
Luke,13,26,"Then you will start saying, “We dined with you, and you taught in our streets.”"
Luke,13,27,"But he will say, “I really don't know who you are! Get away from me, you evil people!”"
Luke,13,28,"Then when you have been thrown outside, you will weep and grit your teeth because you will see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets in God's kingdom."
Luke,13,29,People will come from all directions and sit down to feast in God's kingdom.
Luke,13,30,"There the ones who are now least important will be the most important, and those who are now most important will be least important."
Luke,13,31,"At that time some Pharisees came to Jesus and said, “You had better get away from here! Herod wants to kill you.”"
Luke,13,32,"Jesus said to them: Go and tell that fox, “I am going to force out demons and heal people today and tomorrow, and three days later I'll have finished.”"
Luke,13,33,"But I am going on my way today and tomorrow and the next day. After all, Jerusalem is the place where prophets are killed."
Luke,13,34,"Jerusalem, Jerusalem! Your people have killed the prophets and have stoned the messengers who were sent to you. I have often wanted to gather your people, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings. But you wouldn't let me."
Luke,13,35,"Now your temple will be deserted. You won't see me again until the time when you say, “Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord.”"
Luke,14,1,"One Sabbath, Jesus was having dinner in the home of an important Pharisee, and everyone was carefully watching Jesus."
Luke,14,2,All of a sudden a man with swollen legs stood up in front of him.
Luke,14,3,"Jesus turned and asked the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law of Moses, “Is it right to heal on the Sabbath?”"
Luke,14,4,But they did not say a word. Jesus took hold of the man. Then he healed him and sent him away.
Luke,14,5,"Afterwards, Jesus asked the people, “If your son or ox falls into a well, wouldn't you pull him out straight away, even on the Sabbath?”"
Luke,14,6,There was nothing they could say.
Luke,14,7,Jesus saw how the guests had tried to take the best seats. So he told them:
Luke,14,8,"When you are invited to a wedding feast, don't sit in the best place. Someone more important may have been invited."
Luke,14,9,"Then the one who invited you will come and say, “Give your place to this other guest!” You will be embarrassed and will have to sit in the worst place."
Luke,14,10,"When you are invited to be a guest, go and sit in the worst place. Then the one who invited you may come and say, “My friend, take a better seat!” You will then be honoured in front of all the other guests."
Luke,14,11,"If you put yourself above others, you will be put down. But if you humble yourself, you will be honoured."
Luke,14,12,"Then Jesus said to the man who had invited him: When you give a dinner or a banquet, don't invite your friends and family and relatives and rich neighbours. If you do, they will invite you in return, and you will be paid back."
Luke,14,13,"When you give a feast, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind."
Luke,14,14,They cannot pay you back. But God will bless you and reward you when his people rise from death.
Luke,14,15,"After Jesus had finished speaking, one of the guests said, “The greatest blessing of all is to be at the banquet in God's kingdom!”"
Luke,14,16,Jesus told him: A man once gave a great banquet and invited a lot of guests.
Luke,14,17,"When the banquet was ready, he sent a servant to tell the guests, “Everything is ready! Please come.”"
Luke,14,18,"One guest after another started making excuses. The first one said, “I bought some land, and I've got to look it over. Please excuse me.”"
Luke,14,19,"Another guest said, “I bought five teams of oxen, and I need to try them out. Please excuse me.”"
Luke,14,20,"Still another guest said, “I have just got married, and I can't be there.”"
Luke,14,21,"The servant told his master what happened, and the master became so angry that he said, “Go as fast as you can to every street and alley in town! Bring in everyone who is poor or crippled or blind or lame.”"
Luke,14,22,"When the servant returned, he said, “Master, I've done what you told me, and there is still plenty of room for more people.”"
Luke,14,23,"His master then told him, “Go out along the back roads and lanes and make people come in, so that my house will be full."
Luke,14,24,Not one of the guests I first invited will get even a bite of my food!”
Luke,14,25,"Large crowds were walking along with Jesus, when he turned and said:"
Luke,14,26,"You cannot be my disciple, unless you love me more than you love your father and mother, your wife and children, and your brothers and sisters. You cannot come with me unless you love me more than you love your own life."
Luke,14,27,You cannot be my disciple unless you carry your own cross and come with me.
Luke,14,28,Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. What is the first thing you will do? Won't you sit down and figure out how much it will cost and if you have enough money to pay for it?
Luke,14,29,"Otherwise, you will start building the tower, but not be able to finish. Then everyone who sees what is happening will laugh at you."
Luke,14,30,"They will say, “You started building, but could not finish the job.”"
Luke,14,31,"What will a king do if he has only ten thousand soldiers to defend himself against a king who is about to attack him with twenty thousand soldiers? Before he goes out to battle, won't he first sit down and decide if he can win?"
Luke,14,32,"If he thinks he won't be able to defend himself, he will send messengers and ask for peace while the other king is still a long way off."
Luke,14,33,"So then, you cannot be my disciple unless you give away everything you own."
Luke,14,34,"Salt is good, but if it no longer tastes like salt, how can it be made to taste salty again?"
Luke,14,35,"It is no longer good for the soil or even for the manure pile. People simply throw it out. If you have ears, pay attention!"
Luke,15,1,Tax collectors and sinners were all crowding around to listen to Jesus.
Luke,15,2,"So the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law of Moses started grumbling, “This man is friendly with sinners. He even eats with them.”"
Luke,15,3,Then Jesus told them this story:
Luke,15,4,"If any of you has a hundred sheep, and one of them gets lost, what will you do? Won't you leave the ninety-nine in the field and go and look for the lost sheep until you find it?"
Luke,15,5,"And when you find it, you will be so glad that you will put it on your shoulder"
Luke,15,6,"and carry it home. Then you will call in your friends and neighbours and say, “Let's celebrate! I've found my lost sheep.”"
Luke,15,7,"Jesus said, “In the same way there is more happiness in heaven because of one sinner who turns to God than over ninety-nine good people who don't need to.”"
Luke,15,8,"Jesus told the people another story: What will a woman do if she has ten silver coins and loses one of them? Won't she light a lamp, sweep the floor, and look carefully until she finds it?"
Luke,15,9,"Then she will call in her friends and neighbours and say, “Let's celebrate! I've found the coin I lost.”"
Luke,15,10,"Jesus said, “In the same way God's angels are happy when even one person turns to him.”"
Luke,15,11,Jesus also told them another story: Once a man had two sons.
Luke,15,12,"The younger son said to his father, “Give me my share of the property.” So the father divided his property between his two sons."
Luke,15,13,"Not long after that, the younger son packed up everything he owned and left for a foreign country, where he wasted all his money in wild living."
Luke,15,14,"He had spent everything, when a bad famine spread through that whole land. Soon he had nothing to eat."
Luke,15,15,"He went to work for a man in that country, and the man sent him out to take care of his pigs."
Luke,15,16,"He would have been glad to eat what the pigs were eating, but no one gave him a thing."
Luke,15,17,"Finally, he came to his senses and said, “My father's workers have plenty to eat, and here I am, starving to death!"
Luke,15,18,"I will go to my father and say to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against God in heaven and against you."
Luke,15,19,I am no longer good enough to be called your son. Treat me like one of your workers.’ ”
Luke,15,20,"The younger son got up and started back to his father. But when he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt sorry for him. He ran to his son and hugged and kissed him."
Luke,15,21,"The son said, “Father, I have sinned against God in heaven and against you. I am no longer good enough to be called your son.”"
Luke,15,22,"But his father said to the servants, “Hurry and bring the best clothes and put them on him. Give him a ring for his finger and sandals for his feet."
Luke,15,23,"Get the best calf and prepare it, so we can eat and celebrate."
Luke,15,24,"This son of mine was dead, but has now come back to life. He was lost and has now been found.” And they began to celebrate."
Luke,15,25,"The elder son had been out in the field. But when he came near the house, he heard the music and dancing."
Luke,15,26,"So he called one of the servants over and asked, “What's going on here?”"
Luke,15,27,"The servant answered, “Your brother has come home safe and sound, and your father ordered us to kill the best calf.”"
Luke,15,28,The elder brother got so angry that he would not even go into the house. His father came out and begged him to go in.
Luke,15,29,"But he said to his father, “For years I have worked for you like a slave and have always obeyed you. But you have never even given me a little goat, so that I could give a dinner for my friends."
Luke,15,30,"This other son of yours wasted your money on prostitutes. And now that he has come home, you ordered the best calf to be killed for a feast.”"
Luke,15,31,"His father replied, “My son, you are always with me, and everything I have is yours."
Luke,15,32,"But we should be glad and celebrate! Your brother was dead, but he is now alive. He was lost and has now been found.”"
Luke,16,1,Jesus said to his disciples: A rich man once had a manager to take care of his business. But he was told that his manager was wasting money.
Luke,16,2,"So the rich man called him in and said, “What is this I hear about you? Tell me what you have done! You are no longer going to work for me.”"
Luke,16,3,"The manager said to himself, “What shall I do now that my master is going to fire me? I can't dig ditches, and I'm ashamed to beg."
Luke,16,4,"I know what I'll do, so that people will welcome me into their homes after I've lost my job.”"
Luke,16,5,"Then one by one he called in the people who were in debt to his master. He asked the first one, “How much do you owe my master?”"
Luke,16,6,"“A hundred barrels of olive oil,” the man answered. So the manager said, “Take your bill and sit down and quickly write ‘fifty’.”"
Luke,16,7,"The manager asked someone else who was in debt to his master, “How much do you owe?” “A thousand sacks of wheat,” the man replied. The manager said, “Take your bill and write ‘eight hundred’.”"
Luke,16,8,The master praised his dishonest manager for looking out for himself so well. That's how it is! The people of this world look out for themselves better than the people who belong to the light.
Luke,16,9,"My disciples, I tell you to use wicked wealth to make friends for yourselves. Then when it is gone, you will be welcomed into an eternal home."
Luke,16,10,Anyone who can be trusted in little matters can also be trusted in important matters. But anyone who is dishonest in little matters will be dishonest in important matters.
Luke,16,11,"If you cannot be trusted with this wicked wealth, who will trust you with true wealth?"
Luke,16,12,"And if you cannot be trusted with what belongs to someone else, who will give you something that will be your own?"
Luke,16,13,You cannot be the slave of two masters. You will like one more than the other or be more loyal to one than to the other. You cannot serve God and money.
Luke,16,14,"The Pharisees really loved money. So when they heard what Jesus said, they made fun of him."
Luke,16,15,"But Jesus told them: You are always making yourselves look good, but God sees what is in your heart. The things that most people think are important are worthless as far as God is concerned."
Luke,16,16,"Until the time of John the Baptist, people had to obey the Law of Moses and the Books of the Prophets. But since God's kingdom has been preached, everyone is trying hard to get in."
Luke,16,17,Heaven and earth will disappear before the smallest letter of the Law does.
Luke,16,18,It is a terrible sin for a man to divorce his wife and marry another woman. It is also a terrible sin for a man to marry a divorced woman.
Luke,16,19,There was once a rich man who wore expensive clothes and every day ate the best food.
Luke,16,20,But a poor beggar named Lazarus was brought to the gate of the rich man's house.
Luke,16,21,"He was happy just to eat the scraps that fell from the rich man's table. His body was covered with sores, and dogs kept coming up to lick them."
Luke,16,22,"The poor man died, and angels took him to the place of honour next to Abraham. The rich man also died and was buried."
Luke,16,23,"He went to hell and was suffering terribly. When he looked up and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his side,"
Luke,16,24,"he said to Abraham, “Have pity on me! Send Lazarus to dip his finger in water and touch my tongue. I'm suffering terribly in this fire.”"
Luke,16,25,"Abraham answered, “My friend, remember that while you lived, you had everything good, and Lazarus had everything bad. Now he is happy, and you are in pain."
Luke,16,26,"And besides, there is a deep ditch between us, and no one from either side can cross over.”"
Luke,16,27,"But the rich man said, “Abraham, then please send Lazarus to my father's home."
Luke,16,28,"Let him warn my five brothers, so they won't come to this horrible place.”"
Luke,16,29,"Abraham answered, “Your brothers can read what Moses and the prophets wrote. They should pay attention to that.”"
Luke,16,30,"Then the rich man said, “No, that's not enough! If only someone from the dead would go to them, they would listen and turn to God.”"
Luke,16,31,"So Abraham said, “If they won't pay attention to Moses and the prophets, they won't listen even to someone who comes back from the dead.”"
Luke,17,1,Jesus said to his disciples: There will always be something that causes people to sin. But anyone who causes them to sin is in for trouble. A person who causes even one of my little followers to sin
Luke,17,2,would be better off thrown into the ocean with a heavy stone tied around their neck.
Luke,17,3,"So be careful what you do. Correct any followers of mine who sin, and forgive the ones who say they are sorry."
Luke,17,4,"Even if one of them ill-treats you seven times in one day and says, “I am sorry,” you should still forgive that person."
Luke,17,5,"The apostles said to the Lord, “Make our faith stronger!”"
Luke,17,6,"Jesus replied: If you had faith no bigger than a tiny mustard seed, you could tell this mulberry tree to pull itself up, roots and all, and to plant itself in the ocean. And it would!"
Luke,17,7,"If your servant comes in from ploughing or from taking care of the sheep, would you say, “Welcome! Come on in and have something to eat”?"
Luke,17,8,"No, you wouldn't say that. You would say, “Prepare me something to eat. Get ready to serve me, so I can have my meal. Then later on you can eat and drink.”"
Luke,17,9,Servants don't deserve special thanks for doing what they are supposed to do.
Luke,17,10,"And that's how it should be with you. When you've done all you should, then say, “We are merely servants, and we have simply done our duty.”"
Luke,17,11,"On his way to Jerusalem, Jesus went along the border between Samaria and Galilee."
Luke,17,12,"As he was going into a village, ten men with leprosy came towards him. They stood at a distance"
Luke,17,13,"and shouted, “Jesus, Master, have pity on us!”"
Luke,17,14,"Jesus looked at them and said, “Go and show yourselves to the priests.” On their way they were healed."
Luke,17,15,"When one of them discovered that he was healed, he came back, shouting praises to God."
Luke,17,16,He bowed down at the feet of Jesus and thanked him. The man was from the country of Samaria.
Luke,17,17,"Jesus asked, “Weren't ten men healed? Where are the other nine?"
Luke,17,18,Why was this foreigner the only one who came back to thank God?”
Luke,17,19,"Then Jesus told the man, “You may get up and go. Your faith has made you well.”"
Luke,17,20,"Some Pharisees asked Jesus when God's kingdom would come. He answered, “God's kingdom isn't something you can see."
Luke,17,21,"There is no use saying, ‘Look! Here it is’ or ‘Look! There it is.’ God's kingdom is here with you.”"
Luke,17,22,"Jesus said to his disciples: The time will come when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not."
Luke,17,23,"When people say to you, “Look there,” or “Look here,” don't go looking for him."
Luke,17,24,The day of the Son of Man will be like lightning flashing across the sky.
Luke,17,25,But first he must suffer terribly and be rejected by the people of today.
Luke,17,26,"When the Son of Man comes, things will be just as they were when Noah lived."
Luke,17,27,"People were eating, drinking, and getting married right up to the day when Noah went into the big boat. Then the flood came and drowned everyone on earth."
Luke,17,28,"When Lot lived, people were also eating and drinking. They were buying, selling, planting, and building."
Luke,17,29,"But on the very day Lot left Sodom, fiery flames poured down from the sky and killed everyone."
Luke,17,30,The same will happen on the day when the Son of Man appears.
Luke,17,31,At that time no one on a rooftop should go down into the house to get anything. No one in a field should go back to the house for anything.
Luke,17,32,Remember what happened to Lot's wife.
Luke,17,33,"People who try to save their lives will lose them, and those who lose their lives will save them."
Luke,17,34,"On that night two people will be sleeping in the same bed, but only one will be taken. The other will be left."
Luke,18,1,Jesus told his disciples a story about how they should keep on praying and never give up:
Luke,18,2,In a town there was once a judge who didn't fear God or care about people.
Luke,18,3,"In that same town there was a widow who kept going to the judge and saying, “Make sure that I get fair treatment in court.”"
Luke,18,4,"For a while the judge refused to do anything. Finally, he said to himself, “Even though I don't fear God or care about people,"
Luke,18,5,"I will help this widow because she keeps on bothering me. If I don't help her, she will wear me out.”"
Luke,18,6,The Lord said: Think about what that crooked judge said.
Luke,18,7,Won't God protect his chosen ones who pray to him day and night? Won't he be concerned for them?
Luke,18,8,"He will hurry and help them. But when the Son of Man comes, will he find on this earth anyone with faith?"
Luke,18,9,Jesus told a story to some people who thought they were better than others and who looked down on everyone else:
Luke,18,10,Two men went into the temple to pray. One was a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.
Luke,18,11,"The Pharisee stood over by himself and prayed, “God, I thank you that I am not greedy, dishonest, and unfaithful in marriage like other people. And I am really glad that I am not like that tax collector over there."
Luke,18,12,"I go without eating for two days a week, and I give you one tenth of all I earn.”"
Luke,18,13,"The tax collector stood off at a distance and did not think he was good enough even to look up towards heaven. He was so sorry for what he had done that he pounded his chest and prayed, “God, have pity on me! I am such a sinner.”"
Luke,18,14,"Then Jesus said, “When the two men went home, it was the tax collector and not the Pharisee who was pleasing to God. If you put yourself above others, you will be put down. But if you humble yourself, you will be honoured.”"
Luke,18,15,"Some people brought their little children for Jesus to bless. But when his disciples saw them doing this, they told the people to stop bothering him."
Luke,18,16,"So Jesus called the children over to him and said, “Let the children come to me! Don't try to stop them. People who are like these children belong to God's kingdom."
Luke,18,17,You will never get into God's kingdom unless you enter it like a child!”
Luke,18,18,"An important man asked Jesus, “Good Teacher, what must I do to have eternal life?”"
Luke,18,19,"Jesus said, “Why do you call me good? Only God is good."
Luke,18,20,You know the commandments: ‘Be faithful in marriage. Do not murder. Do not steal. Do not tell lies about others. Respect your father and mother.’ ”
Luke,18,21,"He told Jesus, “I have obeyed all these commandments since I was a young man.”"
Luke,18,22,"When Jesus heard this, he said, “There is one thing you still need to do. Go and sell everything you own! Give the money to the poor, and you will have riches in heaven. Then come and be my follower.”"
Luke,18,23,"When the man heard this, he was sad, because he was very rich."
Luke,18,24,"Jesus saw how sad the man was. So he said, “It's terribly hard for rich people to get into God's kingdom!"
Luke,18,25,"In fact, it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to get into God's kingdom.”"
Luke,18,26,"When the crowd heard this, they asked, “How can anyone ever be saved?”"
Luke,18,27,"Jesus replied, “There are some things that people cannot do, but God can do anything.”"
Luke,18,28,"Peter said, “Remember, we left everything to be your followers!”"
Luke,18,29,"Jesus answered, “You can be sure that anyone who gives up home or wife or brothers or family or children because of God's kingdom"
Luke,18,30,will be given much more in this life. And in the future world they will have eternal life.”
Luke,18,31,Jesus took the twelve apostles aside and said: We are now on our way to Jerusalem. Everything that the prophets wrote about the Son of Man will happen there.
Luke,18,32,"He will be handed over to foreigners, who will make fun of him, ill-treat him, and spit on him."
Luke,18,33,"They will beat him and kill him, but three days later he will rise to life."
Luke,18,34,"The apostles did not understand what Jesus was talking about. They could not understand, because the meaning of what he said was hidden from them."
Luke,18,35,"When Jesus was coming close to Jericho, a blind man sat begging beside the road."
Luke,18,36,The man heard the crowd walking by and asked what was happening.
Luke,18,37,Some people told him that Jesus from Nazareth was passing by.
Luke,18,38,"So the blind man shouted, “Jesus, Son of David, have pity on me!”"
Luke,18,39,"The people who were going along with Jesus told the man to be quiet. But he shouted even louder, “Son of David, have pity on me!”"
Luke,18,40,"Jesus stopped and told some people to bring the blind man over to him. When the blind man was getting near, Jesus asked,"
Luke,18,41,"“What do you want me to do for you?” “Lord, I want to see!” he answered."
Luke,18,42,"Jesus replied, “Look and you will see! Your eyes are healed because of your faith.”"
Luke,18,43,"Straight away the man could see, and he went with Jesus and started thanking God. When the crowds saw what happened, they praised God."
Luke,19,1,"Jesus was going through Jericho,"
Luke,19,2,where a man named Zacchaeus lived. He was in charge of collecting taxes and was very rich.
Luke,20,1,"One day, Jesus was teaching in the temple and telling the good news. So the chief priests, the teachers, and the nation's leaders"
Luke,20,2,"asked him, “What right do you have to do these things? Who gave you this authority?”"
Luke,20,3,"Jesus replied, “I want to ask you a question."
Luke,20,4,Who gave John the right to baptize? Was it God in heaven or merely some human being?”
Luke,20,5,"They talked this over and said to each other, “We can't say that God gave John this right. Jesus will ask us why we didn't believe John."
Luke,20,6,"And we can't say that it was merely some human who gave John the right to baptize. The crowd will stone us to death, because they think John was a prophet.”"
Luke,20,7,"So they told Jesus, “We don't know who gave John the right to baptize.”"
Luke,20,8,"Jesus replied, “Then I won't tell you who gave me the right to do what I do.”"
Luke,20,9,Jesus told the people this story: A man once planted a vineyard and let it. Then he left the country for a long time.
Luke,20,10,"When it was time to harvest the crop, he sent a servant to ask the tenants for his share of the grapes. But they beat up the servant and sent him away without anything."
Luke,20,11,So the owner sent another servant. The tenants also beat him up. They insulted him terribly and sent him away without a thing.
Luke,20,12,The owner sent a third servant. He was also beaten terribly and thrown out of the vineyard.
Luke,20,13,"The owner then said to himself, “What am I going to do? I know what. I'll send my son, the one I love so much. They will surely respect him!”"
Luke,20,14,"When the tenants saw the owner's son, they said to one another, “Some day he will own the vineyard. Let's kill him! Then we can have it all for ourselves.”"
Luke,20,15,"So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. Jesus asked, “What do you think the owner of the vineyard will do?"
Luke,20,16,"I'll tell you what. He will come and kill those tenants and let someone else have his vineyard.” When the people heard this, they said, “This must never happen!”"
Luke,20,17,"But Jesus looked straight at them and said, “Then what do the Scriptures mean when they say, ‘The stone that the builders tossed aside is now the most important stone of all’?"
Luke,20,18,"Anyone who stumbles over this stone will get hurt, and anyone it falls on will be smashed to pieces.”"
Luke,20,19,"The chief priests and the teachers of the Law of Moses knew that Jesus was talking about them when he was telling this story. They wanted to arrest him at once, but they were afraid of the people."
Luke,20,20,"Jesus' enemies kept watching him closely, because they wanted to hand him over to the Roman governor. So they sent some men who pretended to be good. But they were really spies trying to catch Jesus saying something wrong."
Luke,20,21,"The spies said to him, “Teacher, we know that you teach the truth about what God wants people to do. And you treat everyone with the same respect, no matter who they are."
Luke,20,22,"Tell us, should we pay taxes to the Emperor or not?”"
Luke,20,23,"Jesus knew that they were trying to trick him. So he told them,"
Luke,20,24,"“Show me a coin.” Then he asked, “Whose picture and name are on it?” “The Emperor's,” they answered."
Luke,20,25,"Then he told them, “Give the Emperor what belongs to him and give God what belongs to God.”"
Luke,20,26,Jesus' enemies could not catch him saying anything wrong there in front of the people. They were amazed at his answer and kept quiet.
Luke,20,27,The Sadducees did not believe that people would rise to life after death. So some of them came to Jesus
Luke,20,28,"and said: Teacher, Moses wrote that if a married man dies and has no children, his brother should marry the widow. Their first son would then be thought of as the son of the dead brother."
Luke,20,29,"There were once seven brothers. The first one married, but died without having any children."
Luke,20,30,"The second one married his brother's widow, and he also died without having any children."
Luke,20,31,"The same thing happened to the third one. Finally, all seven brothers married that woman and died without having any children."
Luke,20,32,At last the woman died.
Luke,20,33,"When God raises people from death, whose wife will this woman be? All seven brothers had married her."
Luke,20,34,Jesus answered: The people in this world get married.
Luke,20,35,But in the future world no one who is worthy to rise from death will either marry
Luke,20,36,"or die. They will be like the angels and will be God's children, because they have been raised to life."
Luke,20,37,"In the story about the burning bush, Moses clearly shows that people will live again. He said, “The Lord is the God worshipped by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”"
Luke,20,38,"So the Lord isn't the God of the dead, but of the living. This means that everyone is alive as far as God is concerned."
Luke,20,39,"Some of the teachers of the Law of Moses said, “Teacher, you have given a good answer!”"
Luke,20,40,"From then on, no one dared to ask Jesus any questions."
Luke,20,41,"Jesus asked, “Why do people say that the Messiah will be the son of King David?"
Luke,20,42,"In the book of Psalms, David himself says, ‘The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right side"
Luke,20,43,until I make your enemies into a footstool for you.’
Luke,20,44,"David spoke of the Messiah as his Lord, so how can the Messiah be his son?”"
Luke,20,45,"While everyone was listening to Jesus, he said to his disciples:"
Luke,20,46,"Guard against the teachers of the Law of Moses! They love to walk around in long robes, and they like to be greeted in the market. They want the front seats in the meeting places and the best seats at banquets."
Luke,20,47,But they cheat widows out of their homes and then pray long prayers just to show off. These teachers will be punished most of all.
Luke,21,1,Jesus looked up and saw some rich people tossing their gifts into the offering box.
Luke,21,2,He also saw a poor widow putting in two pennies.
Luke,21,3,"And he said, “I tell you that this poor woman has put in more than all the others."
Luke,21,4,Everyone else gave what they didn't need. But she is very poor and gave everything she had.”
Luke,21,5,"Some people were talking about the beautiful stones used to build the temple and about the gifts that had been placed in it. Jesus said,"
Luke,21,6,“Do you see these stones? The time is coming when not one of them will be left in place. They will all be knocked down.”
Luke,21,7,"Some people asked, “Teacher, when will all this happen? How can we know when these things are about to take place?”"
Luke,21,8,"Jesus replied: Don't be fooled by those who will come and claim to be me. They will say, “I am Christ!” and “Now is the time!” But don't follow them."
Luke,21,9,"When you hear about wars and riots, don't be afraid. These things will have to happen first, but that isn't the end."
Luke,21,10,"Nations will go to war against one another, and kingdoms will attack each other."
Luke,21,11,"There will be great earthquakes, and in many places people will starve to death and suffer terrible diseases. All sorts of frightening things will be seen in the sky."
Luke,21,12,"Before all this happens, you will be arrested and punished. You will be tried in your meeting places and put in jail. Because of me you will be placed on trial before kings and governors."
Luke,21,13,But this will be your chance to tell about your faith.
Luke,21,14,Don't worry about what you will say to defend yourselves.
Luke,21,15,I will give you the wisdom to know what to say. None of your enemies will be able to oppose you or to say that you are wrong.
Luke,21,16,"You will be betrayed by your own parents, brothers, family, and friends. Some of you will even be killed."
Luke,21,17,"Because of me, you will be hated by everyone."
Luke,21,18,But don't worry!
Luke,21,19,You will be saved by being faithful to me.
Luke,21,20,"When you see Jerusalem surrounded by soldiers, you will know that it will soon be destroyed."
Luke,21,21,"If you are living in Judea at that time, run to the mountains. If you are in the city, leave it. And if you are out in the country, don't go back into the city."
Luke,21,22,This time of punishment is what is written about in the Scriptures.
Luke,21,23,It will be an awful time for women who are expecting babies or nursing young children! Everywhere in the land people will suffer horribly and be punished.
Luke,21,24,Some of them will be killed by swords. Others will be carried off to foreign countries. Jerusalem will be overrun by foreign nations until their time comes to an end.
Luke,21,25,"Strange things will happen to the sun, moon, and stars. The nations on earth will be afraid of the roaring sea and tides, and they won't know what to do."
Luke,21,26,People will be so frightened that they will faint because of what is happening to the world. Every power in the sky will be shaken.
Luke,21,27,"Then the Son of Man will be seen, coming in a cloud with great power and glory."
Luke,21,28,"When all this starts happening, stand up straight and be brave. You will soon be set free."
Luke,21,29,Then Jesus told them a story: When you see a fig tree or any other tree
Luke,21,30,"putting out leaves, you know that summer will soon come."
Luke,21,31,"So, when you see these things happening, you know that God's kingdom will soon be here."
Luke,21,32,You can be sure that some of the people of this generation will still be alive when all this takes place.
Luke,21,33,"The sky and the earth won't last for ever, but my words will."
Luke,21,34,"Don't spend all your time thinking about eating or drinking or worrying about life. If you do, the final day will suddenly catch you"
Luke,21,35,like a trap. That day will surprise everyone on earth.
Luke,21,36,Watch out and keep praying that you can escape all that is going to happen and that the Son of Man will be pleased with you.
Luke,21,37,"Jesus taught in the temple each day, and he spent each night on the Mount of Olives."
Luke,21,38,Everyone got up early and came to the temple to hear him teach.
Luke,22,1,"The Festival of Thin Bread, also called Passover, was near."
Luke,22,2,"The chief priests and the teachers of the Law of Moses were looking for a way to get rid of Jesus, because they were afraid of what the people might do."
Luke,22,3,"Then Satan entered the heart of Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve apostles."
Luke,22,4,Judas went to talk with the chief priests and the officers of the temple police about how he could help them arrest Jesus.
Luke,22,5,They were very pleased and offered to pay Judas some money.
Luke,22,6,He agreed and started looking for a good chance to betray Jesus when the crowds were not around.
Luke,22,7,"The day had come for the Festival of Thin Bread, and it was time to kill the Passover lambs."
Luke,22,8,"So Jesus said to Peter and John, “Go and prepare the Passover meal for us to eat.”"
Luke,22,9,"But they asked, “Where do you want us to prepare it?”"
Luke,22,10,"Jesus told them, “As you go into the city, you will meet a man carrying a jar of water. Follow him into the house"
Luke,22,11,"and say to the owner, ‘Our teacher wants to know where he can eat the Passover meal with his disciples.’"
Luke,22,12,The owner will take you upstairs and show you a large room ready for you to use. Prepare the meal there.”
Luke,22,13,"Peter and John left. They found everything just as Jesus had told them, and they prepared the Passover meal."
Luke,22,14,"When the time came for Jesus and the apostles to eat,"
Luke,22,15,"he said to them, “I have very much wanted to eat this Passover meal with you before I suffer."
Luke,22,16,I tell you that I will not eat another Passover meal until it is finally eaten in God's kingdom.”
Luke,22,17,"Jesus took a cup of wine in his hands and gave thanks to God. Then he told the apostles, “Take this wine and share it with each other."
Luke,22,18,I tell you that I will not drink any more wine until God's kingdom comes.”
Luke,22,19,"Jesus took some bread in his hands and gave thanks for it. He broke the bread and handed it to his apostles. Then he said, “This is my body, which is given for you. Eat this as a way of remembering me!”"
Luke,22,20,"After the meal he took another cup of wine in his hands. Then he said, “This is my blood. It is poured out for you, and with it God makes his new agreement."
Luke,22,21,The one who will betray me is here at the table with me!
Luke,22,22,"The Son of Man will die in the way that has been decided for him, but it will be terrible for the one who betrays him!”"
Luke,22,23,Then the apostles started arguing about who would ever do such a thing.
Luke,22,24,The apostles got into an argument about which one of them was the greatest.
Luke,22,25,"So Jesus told them: Foreign kings order their people around, and powerful rulers call themselves everyone's friends."
Luke,22,26,"But don't be like them. The most important one of you should be like the least important, and your leader should be like a servant."
Luke,22,27,"Who do people think is the greatest, a person who is served or one who serves? Isn't it the one who is served? But I have been with you as a servant."
Luke,22,28,You have stayed with me in all my troubles.
Luke,22,29,"So I will give you the right to rule as kings, just as my Father has given me the right to rule as a king."
Luke,22,30,"You will eat and drink with me in my kingdom, and you will each sit on a throne to judge the twelve tribes of Israel."
Luke,22,31,"Jesus said, “Simon, listen to me! Satan has demanded the right to test each one of you, as a farmer does when he separates wheat from the husks."
Luke,22,32,"But Simon, I have prayed that your faith will be strong. And when you have come back to me, help the others.”"
Luke,22,33,"Peter said, “Lord, I am ready to go with you to jail and even to die with you.”"
Luke,22,34,"Jesus replied, “Peter, I tell you that before a cock crows tomorrow morning, you will say three times that you don't know me.”"
Luke,22,35,"Jesus asked his disciples, “When I sent you out without a money bag or a travelling bag or sandals, did you need anything?” “No!” they answered."
Luke,22,36,"Jesus told them, “But now, if you have a money bag, take it with you. Also take a travelling bag, and if you don't have a sword, sell some of your clothes and buy one."
Luke,22,37,"Do this because the Scriptures say, ‘He was considered a criminal.’ This was written about me, and it will soon come true.”"
Luke,22,38,"The disciples said, “Lord, here are two swords!” “Enough of that!” Jesus replied."
Luke,22,39,"Jesus went out to the Mount of Olives, as he often did, and his disciples went with him."
Luke,22,40,"When they got there, he told them, “Pray that you won't be tested.”"
Luke,22,41,"Jesus walked on a little way before he knelt down and prayed,"
Luke,22,42,"“Father, if you will, please don't make me suffer by making me drink from this cup. But do what you want, and not what I want.”"
Luke,22,43,Then an angel from heaven came to help him.
Luke,22,44,Jesus was in great pain and prayed so sincerely that his sweat fell to the ground like drops of blood.
Luke,22,45,Jesus got up from praying and went over to his disciples. They were asleep and worn out from being so sad.
Luke,22,46,"He said to them, “Why are you asleep? Wake up and pray that you won't be tested.”"
Luke,22,47,"While Jesus was still speaking, a crowd came up. It was led by Judas, one of the twelve apostles. He went over to Jesus and greeted him with a kiss."
Luke,22,48,"Jesus asked Judas, “Are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?”"
Luke,22,49,"When Jesus' disciples saw what was about to happen, they asked, “Lord, should we attack them with a sword?”"
Luke,22,50,One of the disciples even struck at the high priest's servant with his sword and cut off the servant's right ear.
Luke,22,51,“Enough of that!” Jesus said. Then he touched the servant's ear and healed it.
Luke,22,52,"Jesus spoke to the chief priests, the temple police, and the leaders who had come to arrest him. He said, “Why do you come out with swords and clubs and treat me like a criminal?"
Luke,22,53,"I was with you every day in the temple, and you didn't arrest me. But this is your time, and darkness is in control.”"
Luke,22,54,"Jesus was arrested and led away to the house of the high priest, while Peter followed at a distance."
Luke,22,55,"Some people built a fire in the middle of the courtyard and were sitting around it. Peter sat there with them,"
Luke,22,56,"and a servant girl saw him. Then after she had looked at him carefully, she said, “This man was with Jesus!”"
Luke,22,57,"Peter said, “Woman, I don't even know that man!”"
Luke,22,58,"A little later someone else saw Peter and said, “You are one of them!” “No, I'm not!” Peter replied."
Luke,22,59,"About an hour later another man insisted, “This man must have been with Jesus. They both come from Galilee.”"
Luke,22,60,"Peter replied, “I don't know what you are talking about!” At once, while Peter was still speaking, a cock crowed."
Luke,22,61,"The Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered that the Lord had said, “Before a cock crows tomorrow morning, you will say three times that you don't know me.”"
Luke,22,62,Then Peter went out and cried hard.
Luke,22,63,The men who were guarding Jesus made fun of him and beat him.
Luke,22,64,"They put a blindfold on him and said, “Tell us who struck you!”"
Luke,22,65,They kept on insulting Jesus in many other ways.
Luke,22,66,"At daybreak the nation's leaders, the chief priests, and the teachers of the Law of Moses got together and brought Jesus before their council."
Luke,22,67,"They said, “Tell us! Are you the Messiah?” Jesus replied, “If I said so, you wouldn't believe me."
Luke,22,68,"And if I asked you a question, you wouldn't answer."
Luke,22,69,"But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right side of God All-Powerful.”"
Luke,22,70,"Then they asked, “Are you the Son of God?” Jesus answered, “You say I am!”"
Luke,22,71,"They replied, “Why do we need more witnesses? He said it himself!”"
Luke,23,1,Everyone in the council got up and led Jesus off to Pilate.
Luke,23,2,"They started accusing him and said, “We caught this man trying to get our people to riot and to stop paying taxes to the Emperor. He also claims that he is the Messiah, our king.”"
Luke,23,3,"Pilate asked Jesus, “Are you the king of the Jews?” “Those are your words,” Jesus answered."
Luke,23,4,"Pilate told the chief priests and the crowd, “I don't find him guilty of anything.”"
Luke,23,5,"But they all kept on saying, “He has been teaching and causing trouble all over Judea. He started in Galilee and has now come all the way here.”"
Luke,23,6,"When Pilate heard this, he asked, “Is this man from Galilee?”"
Luke,23,7,"After Pilate learnt that Jesus came from the region ruled by Herod, he sent him to Herod, who was in Jerusalem at that time."
Luke,23,8,For a long time Herod had wanted to see Jesus and was very happy because he finally had this chance. He had heard many things about Jesus and hoped to see him perform a miracle.
Luke,23,9,"Herod asked him a lot of questions, but Jesus did not answer."
Luke,23,10,Then the chief priests and the teachers of the Law of Moses stood up and accused him of all kinds of bad things.
Luke,23,11,Herod and his soldiers made fun of Jesus and insulted him. They put a fine robe on him and sent him back to Pilate.
Luke,23,12,"That same day Herod and Pilate became friends, even though they had been enemies before this."
Luke,23,13,"Pilate called together the chief priests, the leaders, and the people."
Luke,23,14,"He told them, “You brought Jesus to me and said he was a troublemaker. But I have questioned him here in front of you, and I have not found him guilty of anything that you say he has done."
Luke,23,15,Herod didn't find him guilty either and sent him back. This man doesn't deserve to be put to death!
Luke,24,1,"Very early on Sunday morning the women went to the tomb, carrying the spices that they had prepared."
Luke,24,2,"When they found the stone rolled away from the entrance,"
Luke,24,3,"they went in. But they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus,"
Luke,24,4,and they did not know what to think. Suddenly two men in shining white clothes stood beside them.
Luke,24,5,"The women were afraid and bowed to the ground. But the men said, “Why are you looking in the place of the dead for someone who is alive?"
Luke,24,6,"Jesus isn't here! He has been raised from death. Remember that while he was still in Galilee, he told you,"
Luke,24,7,‘The Son of Man will be handed over to sinners who will nail him to a cross. But three days later he will rise to life.’ ”
Luke,24,8,Then they remembered what Jesus had said.
John,1,1,In the beginning was the one who is called the Word. The Word was with God and was truly God.
John,1,2,From the very beginning the Word was with God.
John,1,3,"And with this Word, God created all things. Nothing was made without the Word. Everything that was created"
John,1,4,"received its life from him, and his life gave light to everyone."
John,1,5,"The light keeps shining in the dark, and darkness has never put it out."
John,1,6,"God sent a man named John,"
John,1,7,who came to tell about the light and to lead all people to have faith.
John,1,8,John wasn't that light. He came only to tell about the light.
John,1,9,The true light that shines on everyone was coming into the world.
John,1,10,"The Word was in the world, but no one knew him, though God had made the world with his Word."
John,1,11,"He came into his own world, but his own nation did not welcome him."
John,1,12,Yet some people accepted him and put their faith in him. So he gave them the right to be the children of God.
John,1,13,They were not God's children by nature or because of any human desires. God himself was the one who made them his children.
John,1,14,"The Word became a human being and lived here with us. We saw his true glory, the glory of the only Son of the Father. From him all the kindness and all the truth of God have come down to us."
John,1,15,"John spoke about him and shouted, “This is the one I told you would come! He is greater than I am, because he was alive before I was born.”"
John,1,16,"Because of all that the Son is, we have been given one blessing after another."
John,1,17,"The Law was given by Moses, but Jesus Christ brought us undeserved kindness and truth."
John,1,18,"No one has ever seen God. The only Son, who is truly God and is closest to the Father, has shown us what God is like."
John,2,1,"Three days later Mary, the mother of Jesus, was at a wedding feast in the village of Cana in Galilee."
John,2,2,Jesus and his disciples had also been invited and were there.
John,2,3,"When the wine was all gone, Mary said to Jesus, “They don't have any more wine.”"
John,2,4,"Jesus replied, “Mother, my time hasn't yet come! You must not tell me what to do.”"
John,2,5,"Mary then said to the servants, “Do whatever Jesus tells you to do.”"
John,2,6,At the feast there were six stone water jars that were used by the people for washing themselves in the way that their religion said they must. Each jar held about a hundred litres.
John,2,7,"Jesus told the servants to fill them to the top with water. Then after the jars had been filled,"
John,2,8,"he said, “Now take some water and give it to the man in charge of the feast.” The servants did as Jesus told them,"
John,2,9,"and the man in charge drank some of the water that had now turned into wine. He did not know where the wine had come from, but the servants did. He called the bridegroom over"
John,2,10,"and said, “The best wine is always served first. Then after the guests have had plenty, the other wine is served. But you have kept the best until last!”"
John,2,11,"This was Jesus' first miracle, and he did it in the village of Cana in Galilee. There Jesus showed his glory, and his disciples put their faith in him."
John,2,12,"After this, he went with his mother, his brothers, and his disciples to the town of Capernaum, where they stayed for a few days."
John,2,13,"Not long before the Jewish festival of Passover, Jesus went to Jerusalem."
John,2,14,"There he found people selling cattle, sheep, and doves in the temple. He also saw moneychangers sitting at their tables."
John,2,15,"So he took some rope and made a whip. Then he chased everyone out of the temple, together with their sheep and cattle. He turned over the tables of the moneychangers and scattered their coins."
John,2,16,"Jesus said to the people who had been selling doves, “Get those doves out of here! Don't make my Father's house a market place.”"
John,2,17,"The disciples then remembered that the Scriptures say, “My love for your house burns in me like a fire.”"
John,2,18,"The Jewish leaders asked Jesus, “What miracle will you perform to show us why you have done this?”"
John,2,19,"“Destroy this temple,” Jesus answered, “and in three days I will build it again!”"
John,2,20,"The leaders replied, “It took forty-six years to build this temple. What makes you think you can rebuild it in three days?”"
John,2,21,But Jesus was talking about his body as a temple.
John,2,22,"And when he was raised from death, his disciples remembered what he had told them. Then they believed the Scriptures and the words of Jesus."
John,2,23,"In Jerusalem during Passover many people put their faith in Jesus, because they saw him perform miracles."
John,2,24,"But Jesus knew what was in their hearts, and he would not let them have power over him."
John,2,25,No one had to tell him what people were like. He already knew.
John,3,1,There was a man named Nicodemus who was a Pharisee and a Jewish leader.
John,3,2,"One night he went to Jesus and said, “Sir, we know that God has sent you to teach us. You could not perform these miracles, unless God were with you.”"
John,3,3,"Jesus replied, “I tell you for certain that you must be born from above before you can see God's kingdom!”"
John,3,4,"Nicodemus asked, “How can a grown man ever be born a second time?”"
John,3,5,"Jesus answered: I tell you for certain that before you can get into God's kingdom, you must be born not only by water, but by the Spirit."
John,3,6,Humans give life to their children. Yet only God's Spirit can change you into a child of God.
John,3,7,Don't be surprised when I say that you must be born from above.
John,3,8,"Only God's Spirit gives new life. The Spirit is like the wind that blows wherever it wants to. You can hear the wind, but you don't know where it comes from or where it is going."
John,3,9,“How can this be?” Nicodemus asked.
John,3,10,Jesus replied: How can you be a teacher of Israel and not know these things?
John,3,11,I tell you for certain that we know what we are talking about because we have seen it ourselves. But none of you will accept what we say.
John,3,12,"If you don't believe when I talk to you about things on earth, how can you possibly believe if I talk to you about things in heaven?"
John,3,13,"No one has gone up to heaven except the Son of Man, who came down from there."
John,3,14,"And the Son of Man must be lifted up, just as that metal snake was lifted up by Moses in the desert."
John,3,15,Then everyone who has faith in the Son of Man will have eternal life.
John,3,16,"God loved the people of this world so much that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who has faith in him will have eternal life and never really die."
John,3,17,God did not send his Son into the world to condemn its people. He sent him to save them!
John,3,18,No one who has faith in God's Son will be condemned. But everyone who doesn't have faith in him has already been condemned for not having faith in God's only Son.
John,3,19,"The light has come into the world, and people who do evil things are judged guilty because they love the dark more than the light."
John,3,20,"People who do evil hate the light and won't come to the light, because it clearly shows what they have done."
John,3,21,"But everyone who lives by the truth will come to the light, because they want others to know that God is really the one doing what they do."
John,3,22,"Later, Jesus and his disciples went to Judea, where he stayed with them for a while and was baptizing people."
John,4,1,Jesus knew that the Pharisees had heard that he was winning and baptizing more followers than John was.
John,4,2,"But Jesus' disciples were really the ones doing the baptizing, and not Jesus himself."
John,4,3,Jesus left Judea and started for Galilee again.
John,4,4,"This time he had to go through Samaria,"
John,4,5,and on his way he came to the town of Sychar. It was near the field that Jacob had long ago given to his son Joseph.
John,5,1,"Later, Jesus went to Jerusalem for another Jewish festival."
John,5,2,"In the city near the sheep gate was a pool with five porches, and its name in Hebrew was Bethzatha."
John,6,1,"Jesus crossed Lake Galilee, which was also known as Lake Tiberias."
John,6,2,"A large crowd had seen him perform miracles to heal the sick, and those people went with him."
John,7,1,Jesus decided to leave Judea and to start going through Galilee because the Jewish leaders wanted to kill him.
John,7,2,"It was almost time for the Festival of Shelters,"
John,7,3,"and Jesus' brothers said to him, “Why don't you go to Judea? Then your disciples can see what you are doing."
John,7,4,"No one does anything in secret, if they want others to know about them. So let the world know what you are doing!”"
John,7,5,Even Jesus' own brothers had not yet become his followers.
John,7,6,"Jesus answered, “My time hasn't yet come, but your time is always here."
John,7,7,"The people of this world cannot hate you. They hate me, because I tell them that they do evil things."
John,7,8,"Go on to the festival. My time hasn't yet come, and I am not going.”"
John,7,9,Jesus said this and stayed on in Galilee.
John,7,10,"After Jesus' brothers had gone to the festival, he went secretly, without telling anyone."
John,7,11,"During the festival the Jewish leaders looked for Jesus and asked, “Where is he?”"
John,7,12,"The crowds even got into an argument about him. Some were saying, “Jesus is a good man,” while others were saying, “He is lying to everyone.”"
John,7,13,"But the people were afraid of their leaders, and none of them talked in public about him."
John,7,14,"When the festival was about half over, Jesus went into the temple and started teaching."
John,7,15,"The leaders were surprised and said, “How does this man know so much? He has never been taught!”"
John,7,16,Jesus replied: I am not teaching something that I thought up. What I teach comes from the one who sent me.
John,7,17,"If you really want to obey God, you will know if what I teach comes from God or from me."
John,7,18,"If I wanted to bring honour to myself, I would speak for myself. But I want to honour the one who sent me. That is why I tell the truth and not a lie."
John,7,19,Didn't Moses give you the Law? Yet none of you obey it! So why do you want to kill me?
John,7,20,"The crowd replied, “You're mad! What makes you think someone wants to kill you?”"
John,7,21,"Jesus answered: I performed one miracle, and it amazed you."
John,7,22,"Moses commanded you to circumcise your sons. But it wasn't really Moses who gave you this command. It was your ancestors, and even on the Sabbath you circumcise your sons"
John,7,23,in order to obey the Law of Moses. Why are you angry with me for making someone completely well on the Sabbath?
John,7,24,Don't judge by appearances. Judge by what is right.
John,7,25,"Some of the people from Jerusalem were saying, “Isn't this the man they want to kill?"
John,7,26,"Yet here he is, speaking for everyone to hear. And no one is arguing with him. Do you suppose the authorities know that he is the Messiah?"
John,7,27,"But how could that be? No one knows where the Messiah will come from, but we know where this man comes from.”"
John,7,28,"As Jesus was teaching in the temple, he shouted, “Do you really think you know me and where I came from? I didn't come on my own! The one who sent me is truthful, and you don't know him."
John,7,29,"But I know the one who sent me, because I came from him.”"
John,7,30,"Some of the people wanted to arrest Jesus there and then. But no one even laid a hand on him, because his time had not yet come."
John,7,31,"A lot of people in the crowd put their faith in him and said, “When the Messiah comes, he won't perform more miracles than this man has done!”"
John,7,32,"When the Pharisees heard the crowd arguing about Jesus, they got together with the chief priests and sent some temple police to arrest him."
John,7,33,"But Jesus told them, “I will be with you a little while longer, and then I will return to the one who sent me."
John,7,34,"You will look for me, but you won't find me. You cannot go where I am going.”"
John,7,35,"The Jewish leaders asked each other, “Where can he go to keep us from finding him? Is he going to some foreign country where our people live? Is he going there to teach the Greeks?"
John,7,36,"What did he mean by saying that we will look for him, but won't find him? Why can't we go where he is going?”"
John,7,37,"On the last and most important day of the festival, Jesus stood up and shouted, “If you are thirsty, come to me and drink!"
John,7,38,"Have faith in me, and you will have life-giving water flowing from deep inside you, just as the Scriptures say.”"
John,7,39,"Jesus was talking about the Holy Spirit, who would be given to everyone that had faith in him. The Spirit had not yet been given to anyone, since Jesus had not yet been given his full glory."
John,7,40,"When the crowd heard Jesus say this, some of them said, “He must be the Prophet!”"
John,7,41,"Others said, “He is the Messiah!” Others even said, “Can the Messiah come from Galilee?"
John,7,42,The Scriptures say that the Messiah will come from the family of King David. Doesn't this mean that he will be born in David's home town of Bethlehem?”
John,7,43,The people started taking sides against each other because of Jesus.
John,7,44,"Some of them wanted to arrest him, but no one laid a hand on him."
John,7,45,"When the temple police returned to the chief priests and Pharisees, they were asked, “Why didn't you bring Jesus here?”"
John,7,46,"They answered, “No one has ever spoken like that man!”"
John,7,47,"The Pharisees said to them, “Have you also been fooled?"
John,7,48,Not one of the chief priests or the Pharisees has faith in him.
John,7,49,And these people who don't know the Law are under God's curse anyway.”
John,7,50,"Nicodemus was there at the time. He was a member of the council, and was the same one who had earlier come to see Jesus. He said,"
John,7,51,“Our Law doesn't let us condemn people before we hear what they have to say. We cannot judge them before we know what they have done.”
John,7,52,"Then they said, “Nicodemus, you must be from Galilee! Read the Scriptures, and you will find that no prophet is to come from Galilee.”"
John,7,53,"Everyone else went home,"
John,8,1,but Jesus walked out to the Mount of Olives.
John,8,2,"Then early the next morning he went to the temple. The people came to him, and he sat down and started teaching them."
John,8,3,The Pharisees and the teachers of the Law of Moses brought in a woman who had been caught in bed with a man who wasn't her husband. They made her stand in the middle of the crowd.
John,8,4,"Then they said, “Teacher, this woman was caught sleeping with a man who isn't her husband."
John,8,5,The Law of Moses teaches that a woman like this should be stoned to death! What do you say?”
John,8,6,"They asked Jesus this question, because they wanted to test him and bring some charge against him. But Jesus simply bent over and started writing on the ground with his finger."
John,8,7,"They kept on asking Jesus about the woman. Finally, he stood up and said, “If any of you have never sinned, then go ahead and throw the first stone at her!”"
John,8,8,Once again he bent over and began writing on the ground.
John,8,9,"The people left one by one, beginning with the oldest. Finally, Jesus and the woman were there alone."
John,8,10,"Jesus stood up and asked her, “Where is everyone? Isn't there anyone left to accuse you?”"
John,8,11,"“No sir,” the woman answered. Then Jesus told her, “I am not going to accuse you either. You may go now, but don't sin any more.”"
John,8,12,"Once again Jesus spoke to the people. This time he said, “I am the light for the world! Follow me, and you won't be walking in the dark. You will have the light that gives life.”"
John,8,13,"The Pharisees objected, “You are the only one speaking for yourself, and what you say isn't true!”"
John,8,14,"Jesus replied: Even if I do speak for myself, what I say is true! I know where I came from and where I am going. But you don't know where I am from or where I am going."
John,8,15,"You judge in the same way that everyone else does, but I don't judge anyone."
John,8,16,"If I did judge, I would judge fairly, because I would not be doing it alone. The Father who sent me is here with me."
John,8,17,Your Law requires two witnesses to prove that something is true.
John,8,18,"I am one of my witnesses, and the Father who sent me is the other one."
John,8,19,"“Where is your Father?” they asked. “You don't know me or my Father!” Jesus answered. “If you knew me, you would know my Father.”"
John,8,20,"Jesus said this while he was still teaching in the place where the temple treasures were stored. But no one arrested him, because his time had not yet come."
John,8,21,"Jesus also told them, “I am going away, and you will look for me. But you cannot go where I am going, and you will die with your sins unforgiven.”"
John,8,22,"The Jewish leaders asked, “Does he intend to kill himself? Is that what he means by saying we cannot go where he is going?”"
John,8,23,"Jesus answered, “You are from below, but I am from above. You belong to this world, but I don't."
John,8,24,"That is why I said you will die with your sins unforgiven. If you don't have faith in me for who I am, you will die, and your sins will not be forgiven.”"
John,8,25,"“Who are you?” they asked Jesus. Jesus answered, “I am exactly who I told you at the beginning."
John,8,26,"There is a lot more I could say to condemn you. But the one who sent me is truthful, and I tell the people of this world only what I have heard from him.”"
John,8,27,No one understood that Jesus was talking to them about the Father.
John,8,28,"Jesus went on to say, “When you have lifted up the Son of Man, you will know who I am. You will also know that I don't do anything on my own. I say only what my Father taught me."
John,8,29,"The one who sent me is with me. I always do what pleases him, and he will never leave me.”"
John,8,30,"After Jesus said this, many of the people put their faith in him."
John,8,31,"Jesus told the people who had faith in him, “If you keep on obeying what I have said, you truly are my disciples."
John,8,32,"You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”"
John,8,33,"They answered, “We are Abraham's children! We have never been anyone's slaves. How can you say we will be set free?”"
John,8,34,Jesus replied: I tell you for certain that anyone who sins is a slave of sin!
John,8,35,"And slaves don't stay in the family for ever, though the Son will always remain in the family."
John,8,36,"If the Son gives you freedom, you are free!"
John,8,37,"I know that you are from Abraham's family. Yet you want to kill me, because my message isn't really in your hearts."
John,8,38,"I am telling you what my Father has shown me, just as you are doing what your father has taught you."
John,8,39,"The people said to Jesus, “Abraham is our father!” Jesus replied, “If you were Abraham's children, you would do what Abraham did."
John,8,40,"Instead, you want to kill me for telling you the truth that God gave me. Abraham never did anything like that."
John,8,41,"But you are doing exactly what your father does.” “Don't accuse us of having someone else as our father!” they said. “We just have one father, and he is God.”"
John,8,42,"Jesus answered: If God were your Father, you would love me, because I came from God and only from him. He sent me. I did not come on my own."
John,8,43,Why can't you understand what I am talking about? Can't you stand to hear what I am saying?
John,8,44,"Your father is the devil, and you do exactly what he wants. He has always been a murderer and a liar. There is nothing truthful about him. He speaks on his own, and everything he says is a lie. Not only is he a liar himself, but he is also the father of all lies."
John,8,45,"Everything I have told you is true, and you still refuse to have faith in me."
John,8,46,"Can any of you accuse me of sin? If you cannot, why won't you have faith in me? After all, I am telling you the truth."
John,8,47,"Anyone who belongs to God will listen to his message. But you refuse to listen, because you don't belong to God."
John,8,48,"The people told Jesus, “We were right to say that you are a Samaritan and that you have a demon in you!”"
John,8,49,"Jesus answered, “I don't have a demon in me. I honour my Father, and you refuse to honour me."
John,8,50,"I don't want honour for myself. But there is one who wants me to be honoured, and he is also the one who judges."
John,8,51,"I tell you for certain that if you obey my words, you will never die.”"
John,8,52,"Then the people said, “Now we are sure that you have a demon. Abraham is dead, and so are the prophets. How can you say that no one who obeys your words will ever die?"
John,8,53,"Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you think you are?”"
John,8,54,"Jesus replied, “If I honoured myself, it would mean nothing. My Father is the one who honours me. You claim that he is your God,"
John,8,55,"even though you don't really know him. If I said I didn't know him, I would be a liar, just like all of you. But I know him, and I do what he says."
John,8,56,Your father Abraham was really glad to see me.”
John,8,57,“You are not even fifty years old!” they said. “How could you have seen Abraham?”
John,8,58,"Jesus answered, “I tell you for certain that even before Abraham was, I was, and I am.”"
John,8,59,"The people picked up stones to kill Jesus, but he hid and left the temple."
John,9,1,"As Jesus walked along, he saw a man who had been blind since birth."
John,9,2,"Jesus' disciples asked, “Teacher, why was this man born blind? Was it because he or his parents sinned?”"
John,9,3,"“No, it wasn't!” Jesus answered. “But because of his blindness, you will see God perform a miracle for him."
John,9,4,"As long as it is day, we must do what the one who sent me wants me to do. When night comes, no one can work."
John,9,5,"While I am in the world, I am the light for the world.”"
John,9,6,"After Jesus said this, he spat on the ground. He made some mud and smeared it on the man's eyes."
John,9,7,"Then he said, “Go and wash off the mud in Siloam Pool.” The man went and washed in Siloam, which means “One who is sent”. When he had washed off the mud, he could see."
John,9,8,The man's neighbours and the people who had seen him begging wondered if he really could be the same man.
John,9,9,"Some of them said he was the same beggar, while others said he only looked like him. But he told them, “I am that man.”"
John,9,10,“Then how can you see?” they asked.
John,9,11,"He answered, “Someone named Jesus made some mud and smeared it on my eyes. He told me to go and wash it off in Siloam Pool. When I did, I could see.”"
John,9,12,"“Where is he now?” they asked. “I don't know,” he answered."
John,10,1,Jesus said: I tell you for certain that only thieves and robbers climb over the fence instead of going in through the gate to the sheep pen.
John,12,1,"Six days before Passover Jesus went back to Bethany, where he had raised Lazarus from death."
John,12,2,"A meal had been prepared for Jesus. Martha was doing the serving, and Lazarus himself was there."
John,12,3,"Mary took a very expensive bottle of perfume and poured it on Jesus' feet. She wiped them with her hair, and the sweet smell of the perfume filled the house."
John,12,4,"A disciple named Judas Iscariot was there. He was the one who was going to betray Jesus, and he asked,"
John,12,5,“Why wasn't this perfume sold for three hundred silver coins and the money given to the poor?”
John,12,6,Judas did not really care about the poor. He asked this because he carried the money bag and sometimes would steal from it.
John,12,7,"Jesus replied, “Leave her alone! She has kept this perfume for the day of my burial."
John,12,8,"You will always have the poor with you, but you won't always have me.”"
John,12,9,"A lot of people came when they heard that Jesus was there. They also wanted to see Lazarus, because Jesus had raised him from death."
John,12,10,So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus.
John,12,11,He was the reason that many of the Jewish people were turning from them and putting their faith in Jesus.
John,12,12,"The next day a large crowd was in Jerusalem for Passover. When they heard that Jesus was coming for the festival,"
John,12,13,"they took palm branches and went out to greet him. They shouted, “Hooray! God bless the one who comes in the name of the Lord! God bless the King of Israel!”"
John,12,14,"Jesus found a donkey and rode on it, just as the Scriptures say,"
John,12,15,"“People of Jerusalem, don't be afraid! Your King is now coming, and he is riding on a donkey.”"
John,12,16,"At first, Jesus' disciples did not understand. But after he had been given his glory, they remembered all this. Everything had happened exactly as the Scriptures said it would."
John,13,1,"It was before Passover, and Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave this world and to return to the Father. He had always loved his followers in this world, and he loved them to the very end."
John,13,2,"Even before the evening meal started, the devil had made Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, decide to betray Jesus."
John,13,3,Jesus knew that he had come from God and would go back to God. He also knew that the Father had given him complete power.
John,13,4,"So during the meal Jesus got up, removed his outer garment, and wrapped a towel around his waist."
John,13,5,He put some water into a large bowl. Then he began washing his disciples' feet and drying them with the towel he was wearing.
John,13,6,"But when he came to Simon Peter, that disciple asked, “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?”"
John,13,7,"Jesus answered, “You don't really know what I am doing, but later you will understand.”"
John,13,8,"“You will never wash my feet!” Peter replied. “If I don't wash you,” Jesus told him, “you don't really belong to me.”"
John,13,9,"Peter said, “Lord, don't wash just my feet. Wash my hands and my head.”"
John,13,10,"Jesus answered, “People who have bathed and are clean all over need to wash just their feet. And you, my disciples, are clean, except for one of you.”"
John,13,11,"Jesus knew who would betray him. That is why he said, “except for one of you.”"
John,13,12,"After Jesus had washed his disciples' feet and had put his outer garment back on, he sat down again. Then he said: Do you understand what I have done?"
John,13,13,"You call me your teacher and Lord, and you should, because that is who I am."
John,13,14,"And if your Lord and teacher has washed your feet, you should do the same for each other."
John,13,15,"I have set the example, and you should do for each other exactly what I have done for you."
John,13,16,"I tell you for certain that servants are not greater than their master, and messengers are not greater than the one who sent them."
John,13,17,"You know these things, and God will bless you, if you do them."
John,13,18,"I am not talking about all of you. I know the ones I have chosen. But what the Scriptures say must come true. And they say, “The man who ate with me has turned against me!”"
John,13,19,"I am telling you this before it all happens. Then when it does happen, you will believe who I am."
John,13,20,"I tell you for certain that anyone who welcomes my messengers also welcomes me, and anyone who welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me."
John,13,21,"After Jesus had said these things, he was deeply troubled and told his disciples, “I tell you for certain that one of you will betray me.”"
John,13,22,They were confused about what he meant. And they just stared at each other.
John,13,23,"Jesus' favourite disciple was sitting next to him at the meal,"
John,13,24,and Simon motioned for that disciple to find out which one Jesus meant.
John,13,25,"So the disciple leaned towards Jesus and asked, “Lord, which one of us are you talking about?”"
John,13,26,"Jesus answered, “I will dip this piece of bread in the sauce and give it to the one I was talking about.” Then Jesus dipped the bread and gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot."
John,13,27,"At once Satan took control of Judas. Jesus said, “Judas, go quickly and do what you have to do.”"
John,13,28,No one at the meal understood what Jesus meant.
John,13,29,"But because Judas was in charge of the money, some of them thought that Jesus had told him to buy something they needed for the festival. Others thought that Jesus had told him to give some money to the poor."
John,13,30,Judas took the piece of bread and went out. It was already night.
John,13,31,"After Judas had gone, Jesus said: Now the Son of Man will be given glory, and he will bring glory to God."
John,13,32,"Then, after God is given glory because of him, God will bring glory to him, and God will do it very soon."
John,13,33,"My children, I will be with you for a little while longer. Then you will look for me, but you won't find me. I tell you just as I told the people, “You cannot go where I am going.”"
John,13,34,"But I am giving you a new command. You must love each other, just as I have loved you."
John,13,35,"If you love each other, everyone will know that you are my disciples."
John,13,36,"Simon Peter asked, “Lord, where are you going?” Jesus answered, “You can't go with me now, but later on you will.”"
John,13,37,"Peter asked, “Lord, why can't I go with you now? I would die for you!”"
John,13,38,"“Would you really die for me?” Jesus asked. “I tell you for certain that before a cock crows, you will say three times that you don't even know me.”"
John,14,1,"Jesus said to his disciples, “Don't be worried! Have faith in God and have faith in me."
John,14,2,"There are many rooms in my Father's house. I wouldn't tell you this, unless it was true. I am going there to prepare a place for each of you."
John,14,3,"After I have done this, I will come back and take you with me. Then we will be together."
John,14,4,You know the way to where I am going.”
John,14,5,"Thomas said, “Lord, we don't even know where you are going! How can we know the way?”"
John,14,6,"“I am the way, the truth, and the life!” Jesus answered. “Without me, no one can go to the Father."
John,14,7,"If you had known me, you would have known the Father. But from now on, you do know him, and you have seen him.”"
John,14,8,"Philip said, “Lord, show us the Father. That is all we need.”"
John,14,9,"Jesus replied: Philip, I have been with you for a long time. Don't you know who I am? If you have seen me, you have seen the Father. How can you ask me to show you the Father?"
John,14,10,Don't you believe that I am one with the Father and that the Father is one with me? What I say isn't said on my own. The Father who lives in me does these things.
John,14,11,Have faith in me when I say that the Father is one with me and that I am one with the Father. Or else have faith in me simply because of the things I do.
John,14,12,"I tell you for certain that if you have faith in me, you will do the same things that I am doing. You will do even greater things, now that I am going back to the Father."
John,14,13,"Ask me, and I will do whatever you ask. This way the Son will bring honour to the Father."
John,14,14,I will do whatever you ask me to do.
John,14,15,"Jesus said to his disciples: If you love me, you will do as I command."
John,14,16,Then I will ask the Father to send you the Holy Spirit who will help you and always be with you.
John,14,17,"The Spirit will show you what is true. The people of this world cannot accept the Spirit, because they don't see or know him. But you know the Spirit, who is with you and will keep on living in you."
John,14,18,I won't leave you like orphans. I will come back to you.
John,14,19,"In a little while the people of this world won't be able to see me, but you will see me. And because I live, you will live."
John,14,20,"Then you will know that I am one with the Father. You will know that you are one with me, and I am one with you."
John,14,21,"If you love me, you will do what I have said, and my Father will love you. I will also love you and show you what I am like."
John,14,22,"The other Judas, not Judas Iscariot, then spoke up and asked, “Lord, what do you mean by saying that you will show us what you are like, but you will not show the people of this world?”"
John,14,23,"Jesus replied: If anyone loves me, they will obey me. Then my Father will love them, and we will come to them and live in them."
John,14,24,"But anyone who doesn't love me, won't obey me. What they have heard me say doesn't really come from me, but from the Father who sent me."
John,14,25,I have told you these things while I am still with you.
John,14,26,"But the Holy Spirit will come and help you, because the Father will send the Spirit to take my place. The Spirit will teach you everything and will remind you of what I said while I was with you."
John,14,27,"I give you peace, the kind of peace that only I can give. It isn't like the peace that this world can give. So don't be worried or afraid."
John,14,28,"You have already heard me say that I am going and that I will also come back to you. If you really love me, you should be glad that I am going back to the Father, because he is greater than I am."
John,14,29,"I am telling you this before I leave, so that when it does happen, you will have faith in me."
John,14,30,"I cannot speak with you much longer, because the ruler of this world is coming. But he has no power over me."
John,14,31,"I obey my Father, so that everyone in the world might know that I love him. It is time for us to go now."
John,15,1,"Jesus said to his disciples: I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener."
John,15,2,"He cuts away every branch of mine that doesn't produce fruit. But he trims clean every branch that does produce fruit, so that it will produce even more fruit."
John,15,3,You are already clean because of what I have said to you.
John,15,4,"Stay joined to me, and I will stay joined to you. Just as a branch cannot produce fruit unless it stays joined to the vine, you cannot produce fruit unless you stay joined to me."
John,15,5,"I am the vine, and you are the branches. If you stay joined to me, and I stay joined to you, then you will produce lots of fruit. But you cannot do anything without me."
John,15,6,"If you don't stay joined to me, you will be thrown away. You will be like dry branches that are gathered up and burnt in a fire."
John,15,7,"Stay joined to me and let my teachings become part of you. Then you can pray for whatever you want, and your prayer will be answered."
John,15,8,"When you become fruitful disciples of mine, my Father will be honoured."
John,15,9,"I have loved you, just as my Father has loved me. So remain faithful to my love for you."
John,15,10,"If you obey me, I will keep loving you, just as my Father keeps loving me, because I have obeyed him."
John,15,11,I have told you this to make you as completely happy as I am.
John,15,12,"Now I tell you to love each other, as I have loved you."
John,15,13,The greatest way to show love for friends is to die for them.
John,15,14,"And you are my friends, if you obey me."
John,15,15,"Servants don't know what their master is doing, and so I don't speak to you as my servants. I speak to you as my friends, and I have told you everything that my Father has told me."
John,15,16,"You did not choose me. I chose you and sent you out to produce fruit, the kind of fruit that will last. Then my Father will give you whatever you ask for in my name."
John,15,17,So I command you to love each other.
John,15,18,"If the people of this world hate you, just remember that they hated me first."
John,15,19,"If you belonged to the world, its people would love you. But you don't belong to the world. I have chosen you to leave the world behind, and that is why its people hate you."
John,15,20,"Remember how I told you that servants are not greater than their master. So if people ill-treat me, they will ill-treat you. If they do what I say, they will do what you say."
John,15,21,"People will do to you exactly what they did to me. They will do it because you belong to me, and they don't know the one who sent me."
John,15,22,"If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin. But now they have no excuse for their sin."
John,15,23,Everyone who hates me also hates my Father.
John,15,24,"I have done things that no one else has ever done. If they had not seen me do these things, they would not be guilty. But they did see me do these things, and they still hate me and my Father too."
John,15,25,"That is why the Scriptures are true when they say, “People hated me for no reason.”"
John,15,26,I will send you the Spirit who comes from the Father and shows what is true. The Spirit will help you and will tell you about me.
John,15,27,"Then you will also tell others about me, because you have been with me from the beginning."
John,16,1,I am telling you this to keep you from being afraid.
John,16,2,You will be chased out of the Jewish meeting places. And the time will come when people will kill you and think they are doing God a favour.
John,16,3,They will do these things because they don't know either the Father or me.
John,16,4,"I am saying this to you now, so that when the time comes, you will remember what I have said. I was with you at the first, and so I didn't tell you these things."
John,16,5,"But now I am going back to the Father who sent me, and none of you asks me where I am going."
John,16,6,You are very sad from hearing all this.
John,16,7,"But I tell you that I am going to do what is best for you. That is why I am going away. The Holy Spirit cannot come to help you until I leave. But after I am gone, I will send the Spirit to you."
John,16,8,The Spirit will come and show the people of this world the truth about sin and God's justice and the judgment.
John,16,9,"The Spirit will show them that they are wrong about sin, because they didn't have faith in me."
John,16,10,"They are wrong about God's justice, because I am going to the Father, and you won't see me again."
John,16,11,"And they are wrong about the judgment, because God has already judged the ruler of this world."
John,16,12,"I have much more to say to you, but right now it would be more than you could understand."
John,16,13,"The Spirit shows what is true and will come and guide you into the full truth. The Spirit doesn't speak on his own. He will tell you only what he has heard from me, and he will let you know what is going to happen."
John,16,14,The Spirit will bring glory to me by taking my message and telling it to you.
John,16,15,Everything that the Father has is mine. That is why I have said that the Spirit takes my message and tells it to you.
John,16,16,"Jesus told his disciples, “For a little while you won't see me, but after a while you will see me.”"
John,16,17,"They said to each other, “What does Jesus mean by saying that for a little while we won't see him, but after a while we will see him? What does he mean by saying that he is going to the Father?"
John,16,18,What is this ‘little while’ that he is talking about? We don't know what he means.”
John,16,19,"Jesus knew that they had some questions, so he said: You are wondering what I meant when I said that for a little while you won't see me, but after a while you will see me."
John,16,20,"I tell you for certain that you will cry and be sad, but the world will be happy. You will be sad, but later you will be happy."
John,16,21,"When a woman is about to give birth, she is in great pain. But after it is all over, she forgets the pain and is happy, because she has brought a child into the world."
John,16,22,"You are now very sad. But later I will see you, and you will be so happy that no one will be able to change the way you feel."
John,16,23,"When that time comes, you won't have to ask me about anything. I tell you for certain that the Father will give you whatever you ask for in my name."
John,16,24,"You have not asked for anything in this way before, but now you must ask in my name. Then it will be given to you, so that you will be completely happy."
John,16,25,I have used examples to explain to you what I have been talking about. But the time will come when I will speak to you plainly about the Father and will no longer use examples like these.
John,16,26,"You will ask the Father in my name, and I won't have to ask him for you."
John,16,27,"God the Father loves you because you love me, and you believe that I have come from him."
John,16,28,"I came from the Father into the world, but I am leaving the world and returning to the Father."
John,16,29,"The disciples said, “Now you are speaking plainly to us! You are not using examples."
John,16,30,"At last we know that you understand everything, and we don't have any more questions. Now we believe that you truly have come from God.”"
John,16,31,Jesus replied: Do you really believe me?
John,16,32,"The time will come and is already here when all of you will be scattered. Each of you will go back home and leave me by myself. But the Father will be with me, and I won't be alone."
John,16,33,"I have told you this, so that you might have peace in your hearts because of me. While you are in the world, you will have to suffer. But cheer up! I have defeated the world."
John,17,1,"After Jesus had finished speaking to his disciples, he looked up towards heaven and prayed: Father, the time has come for you to bring glory to your Son, in order that he may bring glory to you."
John,17,2,"And you gave him power over all people, so that he would give eternal life to everyone you give him."
John,17,3,"Eternal life is to know you, the only true God, and to know Jesus Christ, the one you sent."
John,17,4,I have brought glory to you here on earth by doing everything you gave me to do.
John,17,5,"Now, Father, give me back the glory that I had with you before the world was created."
John,17,6,"You have given me some followers from this world, and I have shown them what you are like. They were yours, but you gave them to me, and they have obeyed you."
John,17,7,They know that you gave me everything I have.
John,17,8,"I told my followers what you told me, and they accepted it. They know that I came from you, and they believe that you are the one who sent me."
John,17,9,"I am praying for them, but not for those who belong to this world. My followers belong to you, and I am praying for them."
John,17,10,"All that I have is yours, and all that you have is mine, and they will bring glory to me."
John,17,11,"Holy Father, I am no longer in the world. I am coming to you, but my followers are still in the world. So keep them safe by the power of the name that you have given me. Then they will be one with each other, just as you and I are one."
John,17,12,"While I was with them, I kept them safe by the power you have given me. I guarded them, and not one of them was lost, except the one who had to be lost. This happened so that what the Scriptures say would come true."
John,17,13,"I am on my way to you. But I say these things while I am still in the world, so that my followers will have the same complete joy that I do."
John,17,14,"I have told them your message. But the people of this world hate them, because they don't belong to this world, just as I don't."
John,17,15,"Father, I don't ask you to take my followers out of the world, but keep them safe from the evil one."
John,17,16,"They don't belong to this world, and neither do I."
John,17,17,Your word is the truth. So let this truth make them completely yours.
John,17,18,"I am sending them into the world, just as you sent me."
John,17,19,"I have given myself completely for their sake, so that they may belong completely to the truth."
John,17,20,I am not praying just for these followers. I am also praying for everyone else who will have faith because of what my followers will say about me.
John,17,21,"I want all of them to be one with each other, just as I am one with you and you are one with me. I also want them to be one with us. Then the people of this world will believe that you sent me."
John,17,22,"I have honoured my followers in the same way that you honoured me, in order that they may be one with each other, just as we are one."
John,17,23,"I am one with them, and you are one with me, so that they may become completely one. Then this world's people will know that you sent me. They will know that you love my followers as much as you love me."
John,17,24,"Father, I want everyone you have given me to be with me, wherever I am. Then they will see the glory that you have given me, because you loved me before the world was created."
John,17,25,"Good Father, the people of this world don't know you. But I know you, and my followers know that you sent me."
John,17,26,"I told them what you are like, and I will tell them even more. Then the love that you have for me will become part of them, and I will be one with them."
John,18,1,"When Jesus had finished praying, he and his disciples crossed the Kidron Valley and went into a garden."
John,18,2,"Jesus had often met there with his disciples, and Judas knew where the place was."
John,19,1,Pilate gave orders for Jesus to be beaten with a whip.
John,19,2,The soldiers made a crown out of thorn branches and put it on Jesus. Then they put a purple robe on him.
John,19,3,"They came up to him and said, “Hey, you king of the Jews!” They also hit him with their fists."
John,19,4,"Once again Pilate went out. This time he said, “I will have Jesus brought out to you again. Then you can see for yourselves that I have not found him guilty.”"
John,19,5,"Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said, “Here is the man!”"
John,19,6,"When the chief priests and the temple police saw him, they yelled, “Nail him to a cross! Nail him to a cross!” Pilate told them, “You take him and nail him to a cross! I don't find him guilty of anything.”"
John,19,7,"The crowd replied, “He claimed to be the Son of God! Our Jewish Law says that he must be put to death.”"
John,19,8,"When Pilate heard this, he was terrified."
John,19,9,"He went back inside and asked Jesus, “Where are you from?” But Jesus did not answer."
John,19,10,“Why won't you answer my question?” Pilate asked. “Don't you know that I have the power to let you go free or to nail you to a cross?”
John,19,11,"Jesus replied, “If God had not given you the power, you couldn't do anything at all to me. But the one who handed me over to you did something even worse.”"
John,19,12,"Then Pilate wanted to set Jesus free. But the crowd again yelled, “If you set this man free, you are no friend of the Emperor! Anyone who claims to be a king is an enemy of the Emperor.”"
John,19,13,"When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out. Then he sat down on the judge's bench at the place known as “The Stone Pavement”. In Aramaic this pavement is called “Gabbatha”."
John,19,14,"It was about midday on the day before Passover, and Pilate said to the crowd, “Look at your king!”"
John,19,15,"“Kill him! Kill him!” they yelled. “Nail him to a cross!” “So you want me to nail your king to a cross?” Pilate asked. The chief priests replied, “The Emperor is our king!”"
John,19,16,"Then Pilate handed Jesus over to be nailed to a cross. Jesus was taken away,"
John,19,17,and he carried his cross to a place known as “The Skull”. In Aramaic this place is called “Golgotha”.
John,19,18,"There Jesus was nailed to the cross, and on each side of him a man was also nailed to a cross."
John,19,19,"Pilate ordered the charge against Jesus to be written on a board and put above the cross. It read, “Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.”"
John,19,20,"The words were written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek. The place where Jesus was taken wasn't far from the city, and many of the Jewish people read the charge against him."
John,19,21,"So the chief priests went to Pilate and said, “Why did you write that he is King of the Jews? You should have written, ‘He claimed to be King of the Jews.’ ”"
John,19,22,"But Pilate told them, “What is written will not be changed!”"
John,19,23,"After the soldiers had nailed Jesus to the cross, they divided up his clothes into four parts, one for each of them. But his outer garment was made from a single piece of cloth, and it did not have any seams."
John,19,24,"The soldiers said to each other, “Let's not rip it apart. We will gamble to see who gets it.” This happened so that the Scriptures would come true, which say, “They divided up my clothes and gambled for my garments.” The soldiers then did what they had decided."
John,19,25,Jesus' mother stood beside his cross with her sister and Mary the wife of Clopas. Mary Magdalene was standing there too.
John,19,26,"When Jesus saw his mother and his favourite disciple with her, he said to his mother, “This man is now your son.”"
John,19,27,"Then he said to the disciple, “She is now your mother.” From then on, that disciple took her into his own home."
John,19,28,"Jesus knew that he had now finished his work. And in order to make the Scriptures come true, he said, “I am thirsty!”"
John,19,29,A jar of cheap wine was there. Someone then soaked a sponge with the wine and held it up to Jesus' mouth on the stem of a hyssop plant.
John,19,30,"After Jesus drank the wine, he said, “Everything is done!” He bowed his head and died."
John,19,31,"The next day would be both a Sabbath and the Passover. It was a special day for the Jewish people, and they did not want the bodies to stay on the crosses during that day. So they asked Pilate to break the men's legs and take their bodies down."
John,19,32,The soldiers first broke the legs of the other two men who were nailed there.
John,19,33,"But when they came to Jesus, they saw that he was already dead, and they did not break his legs."
John,19,34,"One of the soldiers stuck his spear into Jesus' side, and blood and water came out."
John,19,35,"We know this is true, because it was told by someone who saw it happen. Now you can have faith too."
John,19,36,"All this happened so that the Scriptures would come true, which say, “No bone of his body will be broken”"
John,19,37,"and, “They will see the one in whose side they stuck a spear.”"
John,19,38,"Joseph from Arimathea was one of Jesus' disciples. He had kept it secret though, because he was afraid of the Jewish leaders. But now he asked Pilate to let him have Jesus' body. Pilate gave him permission, and Joseph took it down from the cross."
John,19,39,Nicodemus also came with about thirty kilogrammes of spices made from myrrh and aloes. This was the same Nicodemus who had visited Jesus one night.
John,19,40,"The two men wrapped the body in a linen cloth, together with the spices, which was how the Jewish people buried their dead."
John,19,41,"In the place where Jesus had been nailed to a cross, there was a garden with a tomb that had never been used."
John,19,42,"The tomb was nearby, and since it was the time to prepare for the Sabbath, they were in a hurry to put Jesus' body there."
John,20,1,"On Sunday morning while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been rolled away from the entrance."
John,20,2,"She ran to Simon Peter and to Jesus' favourite disciple and said, “They have taken the Lord from the tomb! We don't know where they have put him.”"
John,20,3,Peter and the other disciple set off for the tomb.
John,20,4,"They ran side by side, until the other disciple ran faster than Peter and got there first."
John,20,5,"He bent over and saw the strips of linen cloth lying inside the tomb, but he did not go in."
John,20,6,"When Simon Peter got there, he went into the tomb and saw the strips of cloth."
John,20,7,He also saw the piece of cloth that had been used to cover Jesus' face. It was rolled up and in a place by itself.
John,20,8,"The disciple who got there first then went into the tomb, and when he saw it, he believed."
John,20,9,At that time Peter and the other disciple did not know that the Scriptures said Jesus would rise to life.
John,20,10,So the two of them went back to the other disciples.
John,20,11,"Mary Magdalene stood crying outside the tomb. She was still weeping, when she stooped down"
John,20,12,and saw two angels inside. They were dressed in white and were sitting where Jesus' body had been. One was at the head and the other was at the foot.
John,20,13,"The angels asked Mary, “Why are you crying?” She answered, “They have taken away my Lord's body! I don't know where they have put him.”"
John,20,14,"As soon as Mary said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there. But she did not know who he was."
John,20,15,"Jesus asked her, “Why are you crying? Who are you looking for?” She thought he was the gardener and said, “Sir, if you have taken his body away, please tell me, so I can go and get him.”"
John,20,16,"Then Jesus said to her, “Mary!” She turned and said to him, “Rabboni.” The Aramaic word “Rabboni” means “Teacher”."
John,20,17,"Jesus told her, “Don't hold on to me! I have not yet gone to the Father. But tell my disciples that I am going to the one who is my Father and my God, as well as your Father and your God.”"
John,20,18,Mary Magdalene then went and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord. She also told them what he had said to her.
John,20,19,"The disciples were afraid of the Jewish leaders, and on the evening of that same Sunday they locked themselves in a room. Suddenly, Jesus appeared in the middle of the group. He greeted them"
John,20,20,"and showed them his hands and his side. When the disciples saw the Lord, they became very happy."
John,20,21,"After Jesus had greeted them again, he said, “I am sending you, just as the Father has sent me.”"
John,20,22,"Then he breathed on them and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit."
John,20,23,"If you forgive anyone's sins, they will be forgiven. But if you don't forgive their sins, they will not be forgiven.”"
John,20,24,"Although Thomas the Twin was one of the twelve disciples, he wasn't with the others when Jesus appeared to them."
John,20,25,"So they told him, “We have seen the Lord!” But Thomas said, “First, I must see the nail scars in his hands and touch them with my finger. I must put my hand where the spear went into his side. I won't believe unless I do this!”"
John,20,26,"A week later the disciples were together again. This time, Thomas was with them. Jesus came in while the doors were still locked and stood in the middle of the group. He greeted his disciples"
John,20,27,"and said to Thomas, “Put your finger here and look at my hands! Put your hand into my side. Stop doubting and have faith!”"
John,20,28,"Thomas replied, “You are my Lord and my God!”"
John,20,29,"Jesus said, “Thomas, do you have faith because you have seen me? The people who have faith in me without seeing me are the ones who are really blessed!”"
John,20,30,"Jesus performed many other miracles for his disciples, and not all of them are written in this book."
John,20,31,"But these are written so that you will put your faith in Jesus as the Messiah and the Son of God. If you have faith in him, you will have true life."
John,21,1,Jesus later appeared to his disciples along the shore of Lake Tiberias.
John,21,2,"Simon Peter, Thomas the Twin, Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, and the brothers James and John, were there, together with two other disciples."
John,21,3,"Simon Peter said, “I'm going fishing!” The others said, “We will go with you.” They went out in their boat. But they didn't catch a thing that night."
John,21,4,"Early the next morning Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not realize who he was."
John,21,5,"Jesus shouted, “Friends, have you caught anything?” “No!” they answered."
John,21,6,"So he told them, “Let your net down on the right side of your boat, and you will catch some fish.” They did, and the net was so full of fish that they could not drag it up into the boat."
John,21,7,"Jesus' favourite disciple told Peter, “It's the Lord!” When Simon heard that it was the Lord, he put on the clothes that he had taken off while he was working. Then he jumped into the water."
John,21,8,The boat was only about a hundred metres from shore. So the other disciples stayed in the boat and dragged in the net full of fish.
John,21,9,"When the disciples got out of the boat, they saw some bread and a charcoal fire with fish on it."
John,21,10,"Jesus told his disciples, “Bring some of the fish you have just caught.”"
John,21,11,"Simon Peter got back into the boat and dragged the net to shore. In it were one hundred and fifty-three large fish, but still the net did not rip."
John,21,12,"Jesus said, “Come and eat!” But none of the disciples dared ask who he was. They knew he was the Lord."
John,21,13,Jesus took the bread in his hands and gave some of it to his disciples. He did the same with the fish.
John,21,14,This was the third time that Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from death.
John,21,15,"When Jesus and his disciples had finished eating, he asked, “Simon son of John, do you love me more than the others do?” Simon Peter answered, “Yes, Lord, you know I do!” “Then feed my lambs,” Jesus said."
John,21,16,"Jesus asked a second time, “Simon son of John, do you love me?” Peter answered, “Yes, Lord, you know I love you!” “Then take care of my sheep,” Jesus told him."
John,21,17,"Jesus asked a third time, “Simon son of John, do you love me?” Peter was hurt because Jesus had asked him three times if he loved him. So he told Jesus, “Lord, you know everything. You know I love you.” Jesus replied, “Feed my sheep."
John,21,18,"I tell you for certain that when you were a young man, you dressed yourself and went wherever you wanted to go. But when you are old, you will hold out your hands. Then others will tie your belt around you and lead you where you don't want to go.”"
John,21,19,"Jesus said this to tell how Peter would die and bring honour to God. Then he said to Peter, “Follow me!”"
John,21,20,"Peter turned and saw Jesus' favourite disciple following them. He was the same one who had sat next to Jesus at the meal and had asked, “Lord, who is going to betray you?”"
John,21,21,"When Peter saw that disciple, he asked Jesus, “Lord, what about him?”"
John,21,22,"Jesus answered, “What is it to you, if I want him to live until I return? You must follow me.”"
John,21,23,"So the rumour spread among the other disciples that this disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say he would not die. He simply said, “What is it to you, if I want him to live until I return?”"
John,21,24,"This disciple is the one who told all this. He wrote it, and we know he is telling the truth."
John,21,25,"Jesus did many other things. If they were all written in books, I don't suppose there would be room enough in the whole world for all the books."
Acts,1,1,"Theophilus, I first wrote to you about all that Jesus did and taught from the very first"
Acts,1,2,"until he was taken up to heaven. But before he was taken up, he gave orders to the apostles he had chosen with the help of the Holy Spirit."
Acts,1,3,"For forty days after Jesus had suffered and died, he proved in many ways that he had been raised from death. He appeared to his apostles and spoke to them about God's kingdom."
Acts,1,4,"While he was still with them, he said: Don't leave Jerusalem yet. Wait here for the Father to give you the Holy Spirit, just as I told you he has promised to do."
Acts,1,5,"John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit."
Acts,1,6,"While the apostles were still with Jesus, they asked him, “Lord, are you now going to give Israel its own king again?”"
Acts,1,7,"Jesus said to them, “You don't need to know the time of those events that only the Father controls."
Acts,1,8,"But the Holy Spirit will come upon you and give you power. Then you will tell everyone about me in Jerusalem, in all Judea, in Samaria, and everywhere in the world.”"
Acts,1,9,"After Jesus had said this and while they were watching, he was taken up into a cloud. They could not see him,"
Acts,1,10,"but as he went up, they kept looking up into the sky. Suddenly two men dressed in white clothes were standing there beside them."
Acts,1,11,"They said, “Why are you men from Galilee standing here and looking up into the sky? Jesus has been taken to heaven. But he will come back in the same way that you have seen him go.”"
Acts,2,1,On the day of Pentecost all the Lord's followers were together in one place.
Acts,2,2,Suddenly there was a noise from heaven like the sound of a mighty wind! It filled the house where they were meeting.
Acts,2,3,"Then they saw what looked like fiery tongues moving in all directions, and a tongue came and settled on each person there."
Acts,2,4,"The Holy Spirit took control of everyone, and they began speaking whatever languages the Spirit let them speak."
Acts,2,5,Many religious Jews from every country in the world were living in Jerusalem.
Acts,2,6,"And when they heard this noise, a crowd gathered. But they were surprised, because they were hearing everything in their own languages."
Acts,2,7,"They were excited and amazed, and said: Don't all these who are speaking come from Galilee?"
Acts,2,8,Then why do we hear them speaking our very own languages?
Acts,2,9,"Some of us are from Parthia, Media, and Elam. Others are from Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia,"
Acts,2,10,"Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, parts of Libya near Cyrene, Rome,"
Acts,2,11,"Crete, and Arabia. Some of us were born Jews, and others of us have chosen to be Jews. Yet we all hear them using our own languages to tell the wonderful things God has done."
Acts,2,12,"Everyone was excited and confused. Some of them even kept asking each other, “What does all this mean?”"
Acts,2,13,"Others made fun of the Lord's followers and said, “They are drunk.”"
Acts,2,14,"Peter stood with the eleven apostles and spoke in a loud and clear voice to the crowd: Friends and everyone else living in Jerusalem, listen carefully to what I have to say!"
Acts,2,15,"You are wrong to think that these people are drunk. After all, it is only nine o'clock in the morning."
Acts,2,16,"But this is what God led the prophet Joel to say,"
Acts,2,17,"“When the last days come, I will give my Spirit to everyone. Your sons and daughters will prophesy. Your young men will see visions, and your old men will have dreams."
Acts,2,18,"In those days I will give my Spirit to my servants, both men and women, and they will prophesy."
Acts,2,19,I will perform miracles in the sky above and wonders on the earth below. There will be blood and fire and clouds of smoke.
Acts,2,20,"The sun will turn dark, and the moon will be as red as blood before the great and wonderful day of the Lord appears."
Acts,2,21,Then the Lord will save everyone who asks for his help.”
Acts,2,22,"Now, listen to what I have to say about Jesus from Nazareth. God proved that he sent Jesus to you by having him perform miracles, wonders, and signs. All of you know this."
Acts,2,23,God had already planned and decided that Jesus would be handed over to you. So you took him and had evil men put him to death on a cross.
Acts,2,24,But God set him free from death and raised him to life. Death could not hold him in its power.
Acts,2,25,"What David said are really the words of Jesus, “I always see the Lord near me, and I will not be afraid with him at my right side."
Acts,2,26,"Because of this, my heart will be glad, my words will be joyful, and I will live in hope."
Acts,2,27,"The Lord won't leave me in the grave. I am his holy one, and he won't let my body decay."
Acts,2,28,"He has shown me the path to life, and he makes me glad by being near me.”"
Acts,2,29,"My friends, it is right for me to speak to you about our ancestor David. He died and was buried, and his tomb is still here."
Acts,2,30,"But David was a prophet, and he knew that God had made a promise he would not break. He had told David that someone from his own family would some day be king."
Acts,2,31,"David knew this would happen, and so he told us that Christ would be raised to life. He said that God would not leave him in the grave or let his body decay."
Acts,2,32,All of us can tell you that God has raised Jesus to life!
Acts,2,33,"Jesus was taken up to sit at the right side of God, and he was given the Holy Spirit, just as the Father had promised. Jesus is also the one who has given the Spirit to us, and that is what you are now seeing and hearing."
Acts,2,34,"David didn't go up to heaven. So he wasn't talking about himself when he said, “The Lord told my Lord to sit at his right side,"
Acts,2,35,until he made my Lord's enemies into a footstool for him.”
Acts,2,36,"Everyone in Israel should then know for certain that God has made Jesus both Lord and Christ, even though you put him to death on a cross."
Acts,2,37,"When the people heard this, they were very upset. They asked Peter and the other apostles, “Friends, what shall we do?”"

Acts,3,6,"But Peter said, “I don't have any silver or gold! But I will give you what I do have. In the name of Jesus Christ from Nazareth, get up and start walking.”"
Acts,3,7,"Peter then took him by the right hand and helped him up. At once the man's feet and ankles became strong,"

Acts,3,12,"Peter saw that a crowd had gathered, and he said: Friends, why are you surprised at what has happened? Why are you staring at us? Do you think we have some power of our own? Do you think we were able to make this man walk because we are so religious?"
Acts,3,13,"The God that Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and our other ancestors worshipped has brought honour to his Servant Jesus. He is the one you betrayed. You turned against him when he was being tried by Pilate, even though Pilate wanted to set him free."
Acts,3,14,"You rejected Jesus, who was holy and good. You asked for a murderer to be set free,"
Acts,3,15,"and you killed the one who leads people to life. But God raised him from death, and all of us can tell you what he has done."
Acts,3,16,"You see this man, and you know him. He put his faith in the name of Jesus and was made strong. Faith in Jesus made this man completely well while everyone was watching."

Acts,3,24,Samuel and all the other prophets who came later also spoke about what is now happening.
Acts,3,25,"You are really the ones God told his prophets to speak to. And you were given the promise that God made to your ancestors. He said to Abraham, “All nations on earth will be blessed because of someone from your family.”"
Acts,3,26,"God sent his chosen Son to you first, because God wanted to bless you and make each one of you turn away from your sins."
Acts,4,1,"The apostles were still talking to the people, when some priests, the captain of the temple guard, and some Sadducees arrived."
Acts,4,2,"These men were angry because the apostles were teaching the people that the dead would be raised from death, just as Jesus had been raised from death."
Acts,4,3,"It was already late in the afternoon, and they arrested Peter and John and put them in jail for the night."
Acts,4,4,But a lot of people who had heard the message believed it. So by now there were about five thousand followers of the Lord.

Acts,4,9,You are questioning us today about a kind deed in which a crippled man was healed.
Acts,4,10,"But there is something we must tell you and everyone else in Israel. This man is standing here completely well because of the power of Jesus Christ from Nazareth. You put Jesus to death on a cross, but God raised him to life."

Acts,4,13,"The officials were amazed to see how brave Peter and John were, and they knew that these two apostles were only ordinary men and not well educated. The officials were certain that these men had been with Jesus."
Acts,4,14,But they could not deny what had happened. The man who had been healed was standing there with the apostles.
Acts,4,15,"The officials commanded them to leave the council room. Then the officials said to each other,"
Acts,4,16,"“What can we do with these men? Everyone in Jerusalem knows about this miracle, and we cannot say it didn't happen."
Acts,4,17,"But to keep this thing from spreading, we will warn them never again to speak to anyone about the name of Jesus.”"
Acts,4,18,"So they called the two apostles back in and told them that they must never, for any reason, teach anything about the name of Jesus."
Acts,4,19,"Peter and John answered, “Do you think God wants us to obey you or to obey him?"
Acts,4,20,We cannot keep quiet about what we have seen and heard.”
Acts,5,1,Ananias and his wife Sapphira also sold a piece of property.
Acts,5,2,"But they agreed to cheat and keep some of the money for themselves. So when Ananias took the rest of the money to the apostles,"
Acts,5,3,"Peter said, “Why has Satan made you keep back some of the money from the sale of the property? Why have you lied to the Holy Spirit?"
Acts,5,4,"The property was yours before you sold it, and even after you sold it, the money was still yours. What made you do such a thing? You didn't lie to people. You lied to God!”"
Acts,5,5,"As soon as Ananias heard this, he dropped dead, and everyone who heard about it was frightened."
Acts,5,6,Some young men came in and wrapped up his body. Then they took it out and buried it.
Acts,5,7,"Three hours later Sapphira came in, but she did not know what had happened to her husband."
Acts,5,8,"Peter asked her, “Tell me, did you sell the property for this amount?” “Yes,” she answered, “that's the amount.”"
Acts,5,9,"Then Peter said, “Why did the two of you agree to test the Lord's Spirit? The men who buried Ananias are by the door, and they will carry you out!”"
Acts,5,10,"At once she fell at Peter's feet and died. When the young men came back in, they found Sapphira lying there dead. So they carried her out and buried her beside her husband."
Acts,5,11,"The church members were afraid, and so was everyone else who heard what had happened."
Acts,5,12,The apostles performed many miracles and wonders among the people. All the Lord's followers often met in the part of the temple known as Solomon's Porch.
Acts,5,13,"No one outside their group dared join them, even though everyone liked them very much."
Acts,5,14,Many men and women started having faith in the Lord.
Acts,5,15,"Then sick people were brought out to the road and placed on stretchers and mats. It was hoped that Peter would walk by, and his shadow would fall on them and heal them."
Acts,5,16,"A lot of people living in the towns near Jerusalem brought those who were sick or troubled by evil spirits, and they were all healed."
Acts,5,17,The high priest and all the other Sadducees who were with him became jealous.
Acts,5,18,They arrested the apostles and put them in the city jail.
Acts,5,19,"But that night an angel from the Lord opened the doors of the jail and led the apostles out. The angel said,"
Acts,5,20,“Go to the temple and tell the people everything about this new life.”
Acts,5,21,"So they went into the temple before sunrise and started teaching. The high priest and his men called together their council, which included all Israel's leaders. Then they ordered the apostles to be brought to them from the jail."
Acts,5,22,"The temple police who were sent to the jail did not find the apostles. They returned and said,"
Acts,5,23,"“We found the jail locked tight and the guards standing at the doors. But when we opened the doors and went in, we didn't find anyone there.”"
Acts,5,24,"The captain of the temple police and the chief priests listened to their report, but they did not know what to think about it."
Acts,5,25,"Just then someone came in and said, “Now those men you put in jail are in the temple, teaching the people!”"
Acts,5,26,The captain went with some of the temple police and brought the apostles back. But they did not use force. They were afraid that the people might start throwing stones at them.
Acts,5,27,"When the apostles were brought before the council, the high priest said to them,"
Acts,5,28,"“We told you plainly not to teach in the name of Jesus. But look what you have done! You have been teaching all over Jerusalem, and you are trying to blame us for his death.”"
Acts,5,29,Peter and the apostles replied: We don't obey people. We obey God.
Acts,5,30,You killed Jesus by nailing him to a cross. But the God our ancestors worshipped raised him to life
Acts,5,31,"and made him our Leader and Saviour. Then God gave him a place at his right side, so that the people of Israel would turn back to him and be forgiven."
Acts,5,32,"We are here to tell you about all this, and so is the Holy Spirit, who is God's gift to everyone who obeys God."
Acts,5,33,"When the council members heard this, they became so angry that they wanted to kill the apostles."
Acts,5,34,"But one of the members was the Pharisee Gamaliel, a highly respected teacher. He ordered the apostles to be taken out of the room for a little while."
Acts,5,35,"Then he said to the council: People of Israel, be careful what you do with these men."
Acts,5,36,"Not long ago Theudas claimed to be someone important, and about four hundred men joined him. But he was killed. All his followers were scattered, and that was the end of that."
Acts,5,37,"Later, when the people of our nation were being counted, Judas from Galilee appeared. A lot of people followed him, but he was killed, and all his followers were scattered."
Acts,5,38,"So I advise you to stay away from these men. Leave them alone. If what they are planning is something of their own doing, it will fail."
Acts,5,39,"But if God is behind it, you cannot stop it anyway, unless you want to fight against God. The council members agreed with what he said,"
Acts,5,40,and they called the apostles back in. They had them beaten with a whip and warned them not to speak in the name of Jesus. Then they let them go.
Acts,5,41,"The apostles left the council and were happy, because God had considered them worthy to suffer for the sake of Jesus."
Acts,5,42,Every day they spent time in the temple and in one home after another. They never stopped teaching and telling the good news that Jesus is the Messiah.
Acts,6,1,A lot of people were now becoming followers of the Lord. But some of the ones who spoke Greek started complaining about the ones who spoke Aramaic. They complained that the Greek-speaking widows were not given their share when the food supplies were handed out each day.
Acts,6,2,"The twelve apostles called the whole group of followers together and said, “We should not give up preaching God's message in order to serve at tables."
Acts,6,3,"My friends, choose seven men who are respected and wise and filled with God's Spirit. We will put them in charge of these things."
Acts,6,4,We can spend our time praying and serving God by preaching.”
Acts,6,5,"This suggestion pleased everyone, and they began by choosing Stephen. He had great faith and was filled with the Holy Spirit. Then they chose Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and also Nicolaus, who worshipped with the Jewish people in Antioch."
Acts,6,6,These men were brought to the apostles. Then the apostles prayed and placed their hands on the men to show that they had been chosen to do this work.
Acts,6,7,"God's message spread, and many more people in Jerusalem became followers. Even a large number of priests put their faith in the Lord."
Acts,6,8,God gave Stephen the power to perform great miracles and wonders among the people.
Acts,6,9,But some Jews from Cyrene and Alexandria were members of a group who called themselves “Free Men”. They started arguing with Stephen. Some others from Cilicia and Asia also argued with him.
Acts,6,10,"But they were no match for Stephen, who spoke with the great wisdom that the Spirit gave him."
Acts,6,11,"So they talked some men into saying, “We heard Stephen say terrible things against Moses and God!”"
Acts,6,12,They turned the people and their leaders and the teachers of the Law of Moses against Stephen. Then they all grabbed Stephen and dragged him in front of the council.
Acts,6,13,"Some men agreed to tell lies about Stephen, and they said, “This man keeps on saying terrible things about this holy temple and the Law of Moses."
Acts,6,14,We have heard him claim that Jesus from Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs that Moses gave us.”
Acts,6,15,Then all the council members stared at Stephen. They saw that his face looked like the face of an angel.
Acts,7,1,"The high priest asked Stephen, “Are they telling the truth about you?”"
Acts,7,2,"Stephen answered: Friends, listen to me. Our glorious God appeared to our ancestor Abraham while he was still in Mesopotamia, before he had moved to Haran."
Acts,7,3,"God told him, “Leave your country and your relatives and go to a land that I will show you.”"
Acts,7,4,"Then Abraham left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. After his father died, Abraham came and settled in this land where you now live."
Acts,7,5,"God didn't give him any part of it, not even a square metre. But God did promise to give it to him and his family for ever, even though Abraham didn't have any children."
Acts,7,6,God said that Abraham's descendants would live for a while in a foreign land. There they would be slaves and would be ill-treated four hundred years.
Acts,7,7,"But he also said, “I will punish the nation that makes them slaves. Then later they will come and worship me in this place.”"
Acts,7,8,"God said to Abraham, “Every son in each family must be circumcised to show that you have kept your agreement with me.” So when Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him. Later, Isaac circumcised his son Jacob, and Jacob circumcised his twelve sons."
Acts,7,9,These men were our ancestors. Joseph was also one of our famous ancestors. His brothers were jealous of him and sold him as a slave to be taken to Egypt. But God was with him
Acts,7,10,and rescued him from all his troubles. God made him so wise that the Egyptian king Pharaoh thought highly of him. Pharaoh even made Joseph governor over Egypt and put him in charge of everything he owned.
Acts,7,11,"Everywhere in Egypt and Canaan the grain crops failed. There was terrible suffering, and our ancestors could not find enough to eat."
Acts,7,12,"But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our ancestors there for the first time."
Acts,7,13,"It was on their second trip that Joseph told his brothers who he was, and Pharaoh learnt about Joseph's family."
Acts,7,14,"Joseph sent for his father and his relatives. In all, there were seventy-five of them."
Acts,7,15,"His father went to Egypt and died there, just as our ancestors did."
Acts,7,16,Later their bodies were taken back to Shechem and placed in the tomb that Abraham had bought from the sons of Hamor.
Acts,7,17,"Finally, the time came for God to do what he had promised Abraham. By then the number of our people in Egypt had greatly increased."
Acts,7,18,"Another king was ruling Egypt, and he didn't know anything about Joseph."
Acts,7,19,"He tricked our ancestors and was cruel to them. He even made them leave their babies outside, so they would die."
Acts,7,20,"During this time Moses was born. He was a very beautiful child, and for three months his parents took care of him in their home."
Acts,7,21,"Then when they were forced to leave him outside, the king's daughter found him and raised him as her own son."
Acts,7,22,Moses was given the best education in Egypt. He was a strong man and a powerful speaker.
Acts,7,23,"When Moses was forty years old, he wanted to help the Israelites because they were his own people."
Acts,7,24,One day he saw an Egyptian ill-treating one of them. So he rescued the man and killed the Egyptian.
Acts,7,25,Moses thought the rest of his people would realize that God was going to use him to set them free. But they didn't understand.
Acts,7,26,"The next day Moses saw two of his own people fighting, and he tried to make them stop. He said, “Men, you are both Israelites. Why are you so cruel to each other?”"
Acts,7,27,"But the man who had started the fight pushed Moses aside and asked, “Who made you our ruler and judge?"
Acts,7,28,"Are you going to kill me, just as you killed that Egyptian yesterday?”"
Acts,7,29,"When Moses heard this, he ran away to live in the country of Midian. His two sons were born there."
Acts,7,30,"Forty years later, an angel appeared to Moses from a burning bush in the desert near Mount Sinai."
Acts,7,31,"Moses was surprised by what he saw. He went closer to get a better look, and the Lord said,"
Acts,7,32,"“I am the God who was worshipped by your ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.” Moses started shaking all over and didn't dare to look at the bush."
Acts,7,33,"The Lord said to him, “Take off your sandals. The place where you are standing is holy."
Acts,7,34,With my own eyes I have seen the suffering of my people in Egypt. I have heard their groans and have come down to rescue them. Now I am sending you back to Egypt.”
Acts,7,35,"This was the same Moses that the people rejected by saying, “Who made you our leader and judge?” God's angel had spoken to Moses from the bush. And God had even sent the angel to help Moses rescue the people and be their leader."
Acts,7,36,"In Egypt and at the Red Sea and in the desert, Moses rescued the people by performing miracles and wonders for forty years."
Acts,7,37,"Moses is the one who told the people of Israel, “God will choose one of your people to be a prophet, just as he chose me.”"
Acts,7,38,"Moses brought our people together in the desert, and the angel spoke to him on Mount Sinai. There he was given these life-giving words to pass on to us."
Acts,7,39,But our ancestors refused to obey Moses. They rejected him and wanted to go back to Egypt.
Acts,7,40,"The people said to Aaron, “Make some gods to lead us! Moses led us out of Egypt, but we don't know what's happened to him now.”"
Acts,7,41,Then they made an idol in the shape of a calf. They offered sacrifices to the idol and were pleased with what they had done.
Acts,7,42,"God turned his back on his people and left them. Then they worshipped the stars in the sky, just as it says in the Book of the Prophets, “People of Israel, you didn't offer sacrifices and offerings to me during those forty years in the desert."
Acts,7,43,"Instead, you carried the tent where the god Molech is worshipped, and you took along the star of your god Rephan. You made those idols and worshipped them. So now I will have you carried off beyond Babylonia.”"
Acts,7,44,The tent where our ancestors worshipped God was with them in the desert. This was the same tent that God had commanded Moses to make. And it was made like the model that Moses had seen.
Acts,7,45,"Later it was given to our ancestors, and they took it with them when they went with Joshua. They carried the tent along as they took over the land from those people that God had chased out for them. Our ancestors used this tent until the time of King David."
Acts,7,46,He pleased God and asked him if he could build a house of worship for the people of Israel.
Acts,7,47,And it was finally King Solomon who built a house for God.
Acts,7,48,"But the Most High God doesn't live in houses made by humans. It is just as the prophet said, when he spoke for the Lord,"
Acts,7,49,"“Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. What kind of house will you build for me? In what place will I rest?"
Acts,7,50,I have made everything.”
Acts,7,51,"You stubborn and hard-headed people! You are always fighting against the Holy Spirit, just as your ancestors did."
Acts,7,52,Is there one prophet that your ancestors didn't ill-treat? They killed the prophets who told about the coming of the One Who Obeys God. And now you have turned against him and killed him.
Acts,7,53,"Angels gave you God's Law, but you still don't obey it."
Acts,7,54,"When the council members heard Stephen's speech, they were angry and furious."
Acts,7,55,"But Stephen was filled with the Holy Spirit. He looked towards heaven, where he saw our glorious God and Jesus standing at his right side."
Acts,7,56,"Then Stephen said, “I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the right side of God!”"
Acts,7,57,The council members shouted and covered their ears. At once they all attacked Stephen
Acts,7,58,and dragged him out of the city. Then they started throwing stones at him. The men who had brought charges against him put their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul.
Acts,7,59,"As Stephen was being stoned to death, he called out, “Lord Jesus, please welcome me!”"
Acts,7,60,"He knelt down and shouted, “Lord, don't blame them for what they have done.” Then he died."
Acts,9,1,Saul kept on threatening to kill the Lord's followers. He even went to the high priest
Acts,9,2,and asked for letters to the Jewish leaders in Damascus. He did this because he wanted to arrest and take to Jerusalem any man or woman who had accepted the Lord's Way.
Acts,9,3,"When Saul had almost reached Damascus, a bright light from heaven suddenly flashed around him."
Acts,9,4,"He fell to the ground and heard a voice that said, “Saul! Saul! Why are you so cruel to me?”"
Acts,9,5,"“Who are you?” Saul asked. “I am Jesus,” the Lord answered. “I am the one you are so cruel to."
Acts,9,6,"Now get up and go into the city, where you will be told what to do.”"
Acts,9,7,"The men with Saul stood there speechless. They had heard the voice, but they had not seen anyone."
Acts,9,8,"Saul got up from the ground, and when he opened his eyes, he could not see a thing. Someone then led him by the hand to Damascus,"
Acts,9,9,and for three days he was blind and did not eat or drink.
Acts,9,10,"A follower named Ananias lived in Damascus, and the Lord spoke to him in a vision. Ananias answered, “Lord, here I am.”"
Acts,9,11,"The Lord said to him, “Get up and go to the house of Judas in Straight Street. When you get there, you will find a man named Saul from the city of Tarsus. Saul is praying,"
Acts,9,12,"and he has seen a vision. He saw a man named Ananias coming to him and putting his hands on him, so that he could see again.”"
Acts,9,13,"Ananias replied, “Lord, a lot of people have told me about the terrible things this man has done to your followers in Jerusalem."
Acts,9,14,Now the chief priests have given him the power to come here and arrest anyone who worships in your name.”
Acts,9,15,"The Lord said to Ananias, “Go! I have chosen him to tell foreigners, kings, and the people of Israel about me."
Acts,9,16,I will show him how much he must suffer for worshipping in my name.”
Acts,9,17,"Ananias left and went into the house where Saul was staying. Ananias placed his hands on him and said, “Saul, the Lord Jesus has sent me. He is the same one who appeared to you along the road. He wants you to be able to see and to be filled with the Holy Spirit.”"
Acts,9,18,"Suddenly something like fish scales fell from Saul's eyes, and he could see. He got up and was baptized."
Acts,9,19,Then he ate and felt much better. For several days Saul stayed with the Lord's followers in Damascus.
Acts,9,20,Soon he went to the Jewish meeting places and started telling people that Jesus is the Son of God.
Acts,9,21,"Everyone who heard Saul was amazed and said, “Isn't this the man who caused so much trouble for those people in Jerusalem who worship in the name of Jesus? Didn't he come here to arrest them and take them to the chief priests?”"
Acts,9,22,"Saul preached with such power that he completely confused the Jewish people in Damascus, as he tried to show them that Jesus is the Messiah."
Acts,9,23,"Later some of them made plans to kill Saul,"
Acts,9,24,but he found out about it. He learnt that they were guarding the gates of the city day and night in order to kill him.
Acts,9,25,Then one night his followers let him down over the city wall in a large basket.
Acts,9,26,"When Saul arrived in Jerusalem, he tried to join the followers. But they were all afraid of him, because they did not believe he was a true follower."
Acts,9,27,"Then Barnabas helped him by taking him to the apostles. He explained how Saul had seen the Lord and how the Lord had spoken to him. Barnabas also said that when Saul was in Damascus, he had spoken bravely in the name of Jesus."
Acts,9,28,Saul moved about freely with the followers in Jerusalem and told everyone about the Lord.
Acts,9,29,"He was always arguing with the Jews who spoke Greek, and so they tried to kill him."
Acts,9,30,But the followers found out about this and took Saul to Caesarea. From there they sent him to the city of Tarsus.
Acts,9,31,"The church in Judea, Galilee, and Samaria now had a time of peace and kept on worshipping the Lord. The church became stronger, as the Holy Spirit encouraged it and helped it grow."
Acts,9,32,"While Peter was travelling from place to place, he visited the Lord's followers who lived in the town of Lydda."
Acts,9,33,"There he met a man named Aeneas, who for eight years had been sick in bed and could not move."
Acts,9,34,"Peter said to Aeneas, “Jesus Christ has healed you! Get up and make up your bed.” Straight away he stood up."
Acts,9,35,Many people in the towns of Lydda and Sharon saw Aeneas and became followers of the Lord.
Acts,9,36,"In Joppa there was a follower named Tabitha. Her Greek name was Dorcas, which means “deer”. She was always doing good things for people and had given much to the poor."
Acts,9,37,"But she became ill and died, and her body was washed and placed in an upstairs room."
Acts,9,38,"Joppa wasn't far from Lydda, and the followers heard that Peter was there. They sent two men to say to him, “Please come with us as quickly as you can!”"
Acts,9,39,"Straight away, Peter went with them. The men took Peter upstairs into the room. Many widows were there crying. They showed him the coats and clothes that Dorcas had made while she was still alive."
Acts,9,40,"After Peter had sent everyone out of the room, he knelt down and prayed. Then he turned to the body of Dorcas and said, “Tabitha, get up!” The woman opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up."
Acts,9,41,He took her by the hand and helped her to her feet. Peter called in the widows and the other followers and showed them that Dorcas had been raised from death.
Acts,9,42,"Everyone in Joppa heard what had happened, and many of them put their faith in the Lord."
Acts,9,43,"Peter stayed on for a while in Joppa in the house of a man named Simon, who made leather."
Acts,10,1,"In Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, who was the captain of a group of soldiers called “The Italian Unit”."
Acts,10,2,"Cornelius was a very religious man. He worshipped God, and so did everyone else who lived in his house. He had given a lot of money to the poor and was always praying to God."
Acts,10,3,"One afternoon at about three o'clock, Cornelius had a vision. He saw an angel from God coming to him and calling him by name."
Acts,10,4,"Cornelius was surprised and stared at the angel. Then he asked, “What is this all about?” The angel answered, “God has heard your prayers and knows about your gifts to the poor."
Acts,10,5,Now send some men to Joppa for a man named Simon Peter.
Acts,10,6,"He is staying with Simon the leather maker, who lives in a house near the sea.”"
Acts,10,7,"After saying this, the angel left. Cornelius called in two of his servants and one of his soldiers who worshipped God."
Acts,10,8,He explained everything to them and sent them off to Joppa.
Acts,10,9,The next day about midday these men were coming near Joppa. Peter went up on the roof of the house to pray
Acts,10,10,"and became very hungry. While the food was being prepared, he fell sound asleep and had a vision."
Acts,10,11,"He saw heaven open, and something came down like a huge sheet held up by its four corners."
Acts,10,12,"In it were all kinds of animals, snakes, and birds."
Acts,10,13,"A voice said to him, “Peter, get up! Kill these and eat them.”"
Acts,10,14,"But Peter said, “Lord, I can't do that! I've never eaten anything that is unclean and not fit to eat.”"
Acts,10,15,"The voice spoke to him again, “When God says that something can be used for food, don't say it isn't fit to eat.”"
Acts,10,16,This happened three times before the sheet was suddenly taken back to heaven.
Acts,10,17,"Peter was still wondering what all this meant, when the men sent by Cornelius came and stood at the gate. They had found their way to Simon's house"
Acts,10,18,and were asking if Simon Peter was staying there.
Acts,10,19,"While Peter was still thinking about the vision, the Holy Spirit said to him, “Three men are here looking for you."
Acts,10,20,"Hurry down and go with them. Don't worry, I sent them.”"
Acts,10,21,"Peter went down and said to the men, “I am the one you are looking for. Why have you come?”"
Acts,10,22,"They answered, “Captain Cornelius sent us. He is a good man who worships God and is liked by the Jewish people. One of God's holy angels told Cornelius to send for you, so he could hear what you have to say.”"
Acts,10,23,"Peter invited them to spend the night. The next morning, Peter and some of the Lord's followers in Joppa left with the men who had come from Cornelius."
Acts,10,24,The next day they arrived in Caesarea where Cornelius was waiting for them. He had also invited his relatives and close friends.
Acts,10,25,"When Peter arrived, Cornelius greeted him. Then he knelt at Peter's feet and started worshipping him."
Acts,10,26,"But Peter took hold of him and said, “Stand up! I am nothing more than a human.”"
Acts,10,27,"As Peter entered the house, he was still talking with Cornelius. Many people were there,"
Acts,10,28,"and Peter said to them, “You know that we Jews are not allowed to have anything to do with other people. But God has shown me that he doesn't think anyone is unclean or unfit."
Acts,10,29,"I agreed to come here, but I want to know why you sent for me.”"
Acts,10,30,Cornelius answered: Four days ago at about three o'clock in the afternoon I was praying at home. Suddenly a man in bright clothes stood in front of me.
Acts,10,31,"He said, “Cornelius, God has heard your prayers, and he knows about your gifts to the poor."
Acts,10,32,"Now send to Joppa for Simon Peter. He is staying in the home of Simon the leather maker, who lives near the sea.”"
Acts,10,33,"I sent for you straight away, and you have been good enough to come. All of us are here in the presence of the Lord God, so that we can hear what he has to say."
Acts,10,34,Peter then said: Now I am certain that God treats all people alike.
Acts,10,35,"God is pleased with everyone who worships him and does right, no matter what nation they come from."
Acts,10,36,"This is the same message that God gave to the people of Israel, when he sent Jesus Christ, the Lord of all, to offer peace to them."
Acts,10,37,You know what happened everywhere in Judea. It all began in Galilee after John had told everyone to be baptized.
Acts,10,38,"God gave the Holy Spirit and power to Jesus from Nazareth. He was with Jesus, as he went around doing good and healing everyone who was under the power of the devil."
Acts,10,39,We all saw what Jesus did both in Israel and in the city of Jerusalem. Jesus was put to death on a cross.
Acts,10,40,"But three days later, God raised him to life and let him be seen."
Acts,10,41,"Not everyone saw him. He was seen only by us, who ate and drank with him after he was raised from death. We were the ones God chose to tell others about him."
Acts,10,42,God told us to announce clearly to the people that Jesus is the one he has chosen to judge the living and the dead.
Acts,10,43,Every one of the prophets has said that all who have faith in Jesus will have their sins forgiven in his name.
Acts,10,44,"While Peter was still speaking, the Holy Spirit took control of everyone who was listening."
Acts,10,45,"Some Jewish followers of the Lord had come with Peter, and they were surprised that the Holy Spirit had been given to Gentiles."
Acts,10,46,"Now they were hearing Gentiles speaking unknown languages and praising God. Peter said,"
Acts,10,47,"“These Gentiles have been given the Holy Spirit, just as we have! I am certain that no one would dare stop us from baptizing them.”"
Acts,10,48,"Peter ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, and they asked him to stay on for a few days."
Acts,11,1,The apostles and the followers in Judea heard that Gentiles had accepted God's message.
Acts,11,2,"So when Peter came to Jerusalem, some of the Jewish followers started arguing with him. They wanted Gentile followers to be circumcised, and"
Acts,11,3,"they said, “You stayed in the homes of Gentiles, and you even ate with them!”"
Acts,11,4,Then Peter told them exactly what had happened:
Acts,11,5,"I was in the town of Joppa and was praying when I fell sound asleep and had a vision. I saw heaven open, and something like a huge sheet held by its four corners came down to me."
Acts,11,6,"When I looked in it, I saw animals, wild beasts, snakes, and birds."
Acts,11,7,"I heard a voice saying to me, “Peter, get up! Kill these and eat them.”"
Acts,11,8,"But I said, “Lord, I can't do that! I've never taken a bite of anything that is unclean and not fit to eat.”"
Acts,11,9,"The voice from heaven spoke to me again, “When God says that something can be used for food, don't say it isn't fit to eat.”"
Acts,11,10,This happened three times before it was all taken back into heaven.
Acts,11,11,Suddenly three men from Caesarea stood in front of the house where I was staying.
Acts,11,12,The Holy Spirit told me to go with them and not to worry. Then six of the Lord's followers went with me to the home of a man
Acts,11,13,who told us that an angel had appeared to him. The angel had ordered him to send to Joppa for someone named Simon Peter.
Acts,11,14,Then Peter would tell him how he and everyone in his house could be saved.
Acts,11,15,"After I started speaking, the Holy Spirit was given to them, just as the Spirit had been given to us at the beginning."
Acts,11,16,"I remembered that the Lord had said, “John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.”"
Acts,11,17,God gave those Gentiles the same gift that he gave us when we put our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. So how could I have gone against God?
Acts,11,18,"When they heard Peter say this, they stopped arguing and started praising God. They said, “God has now let Gentiles turn to him, and he has given life to them!”"
Acts,11,19,"Some of the Lord's followers had been scattered because of the terrible trouble that started when Stephen was killed. They went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, but they told the message only to the Jews."
Acts,11,20,Some of the followers from Cyprus and Cyrene went to Antioch and started telling Gentiles the good news about the Lord Jesus.
Acts,11,21,"The Lord's power was with them, and many people turned to the Lord and put their faith in him."
Acts,11,22,News of what was happening reached the church in Jerusalem. Then they sent Barnabas to Antioch.
Acts,11,23,"When Barnabas got there and saw what God had been kind enough to do for them, he was very glad. So he begged them to remain faithful to the Lord with all their hearts."
Acts,11,24,"Barnabas was a good man of great faith, and he was filled with the Holy Spirit. Many more people turned to the Lord."
Acts,11,25,Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul.
Acts,11,26,"He found Saul and brought him to Antioch, where they met with the church for a whole year and taught many of its people. There in Antioch the Lord's followers were first called Christians."
Acts,11,27,During this time some prophets from Jerusalem came to Antioch.
Acts,11,28,"One of them was Agabus. Then with the help of the Spirit, he told that there would be a terrible famine everywhere in the world. And it happened when Claudius was Emperor."
Acts,11,29,The followers in Antioch decided to send whatever help they could to the followers in Judea.
Acts,11,30,So they asked Barnabas and Saul to take their gifts to the church leaders in Jerusalem.
Acts,12,1,At that time King Herod caused terrible suffering for some members of the church.
Acts,12,2,"He ordered soldiers to cut off the head of James, the brother of John."
Acts,12,3,"When Herod saw that this pleased the Jewish people, he had Peter arrested during the Festival of Thin Bread."
Acts,12,4,He put Peter in jail and ordered four squads of soldiers to guard him. Herod planned to put him on trial in public after the festival.
Acts,12,5,"While Peter was being kept in jail, the church never stopped praying to God for him."
Acts,12,6,"The night before Peter was to be put on trial, he was asleep and bound by two chains. A soldier was guarding him on each side, and two other soldiers were guarding the entrance to the jail."
Acts,12,7,"Suddenly an angel from the Lord appeared, and light flashed around in the cell. The angel poked Peter in the side and woke him up. Then he said, “Quick! Get up!” The chains fell off his hands,"
Acts,12,8,"and the angel said, “Get dressed and put on your sandals.” Peter did what he was told. Then the angel said, “Now put on your coat and follow me.”"
Acts,12,9,"Peter left with the angel, but he thought everything was only a dream."
Acts,12,10,"They went past the two groups of soldiers, and when they came to the iron gate to the city, it opened by itself. They went out and were going along the street, when all at once the angel disappeared."
Acts,12,11,"Peter now realized what had happened, and he said, “I am certain that the Lord sent his angel to rescue me from Herod and from everything the Jewish leaders planned to do to me.”"
Acts,12,12,Then Peter went to the house of Mary the mother of John whose other name was Mark. Many of the Lord's followers had come together there and were praying.
Acts,12,13,"Peter knocked on the gate, and a servant named Rhoda came to answer."
Acts,12,14,"When she heard Peter's voice, she was too excited to open the gate. She ran back into the house and said that Peter was standing there."
Acts,12,15,"“You are mad!” everyone told her. But she kept saying that it was Peter. Then they said, “It must be his angel.”"
Acts,12,16,"But Peter kept on knocking, until finally they opened the gate. They saw him and were completely amazed."
Acts,12,17,"Peter motioned for them to keep quiet. Then he told how the Lord had led him out of jail. He also said, “Tell James and the others what has happened.” After that, he left and went somewhere else."
Acts,12,18,The next morning the soldiers who had been on guard were terribly worried and wondered what had happened to Peter.
Acts,12,19,"Herod ordered his own soldiers to search for him, but they could not find him. Then he questioned the guards and had them put to death. After this, Herod left Judea to stay in Caesarea for a while."
Acts,12,20,"Herod and the people of Tyre and Sidon were very angry with each other. But their country got its food supply from the region that he ruled. So a group of them went to see Blastus, who was one of Herod's high officials. They convinced Blastus that they wanted to make peace between their cities and Herod,"
Acts,12,21,and a day was set for them to meet with him. Herod came dressed in his royal robes. He sat down on his throne and made a speech.
Acts,12,22,"The people shouted, “You speak more like a god than a man!”"
Acts,12,23,"At once an angel from the Lord struck him down because he took the honour that belonged to God. Later, Herod was eaten by worms and died."
Acts,12,24,God's message kept spreading.
Acts,12,25,"And after Barnabas and Saul had done the work they were sent to do, they went back to Jerusalem with John, whose other name was Mark."
Acts,13,1,"The church at Antioch had several prophets and teachers. They were Barnabas, Simeon, also called Niger, Lucius from Cyrene, Manaen, who was Herod's close friend, and Saul."
Acts,13,2,"While they were worshipping the Lord and going without eating, the Holy Spirit told them, “Appoint Barnabas and Saul to do the work for which I have chosen them.”"
Acts,13,3,"Everyone prayed and went without eating for a while longer. Next, they placed their hands on Barnabas and Saul to show that they had been appointed to do this work. Then everyone sent them on their way."
Acts,13,4,"After Barnabas and Saul had been sent by the Holy Spirit, they went to Seleucia. From there they sailed to the island of Cyprus."
Acts,13,5,They arrived at Salamis and began to preach God's message in the Jewish meeting places. They also had John as a helper.
Acts,13,6,"Barnabas and Saul went all the way to the city of Paphos on the other end of the island, where they met a Jewish man named Bar-Jesus. He practised witchcraft and was a false prophet."
Acts,13,7,"He also worked for Sergius Paulus, who was very clever and was the governor of the island. Sergius Paulus wanted to hear God's message, and he sent for Barnabas and Saul."
Acts,13,8,"But Bar-Jesus, whose other name was Elymas, was against them. He even tried to keep the governor from having faith in the Lord."
Acts,13,9,"Then Saul, better known as Paul, was filled with the Holy Spirit. He looked straight at Elymas"
Acts,13,10,"and said, “You son of the devil! You are a liar, a criminal, and an enemy of everything that is right. When will you stop speaking against the true ways of the Lord?"
Acts,13,11,"The Lord is going to punish you by making you completely blind for a while.” Suddenly the man's eyes were covered by a dark mist, and he went around trying to get someone to lead him by the hand."
Acts,13,12,"When the governor saw what had happened, he was amazed at this teaching about the Lord. So he put his faith in the Lord."
Acts,13,13,Paul and the others left Paphos and sailed to Perga in Pamphylia. But John left them and went back to Jerusalem.
Acts,13,14,The rest of them went on from Perga to Antioch in Pisidia. Then on the Sabbath they went to the Jewish meeting place and sat down.
Acts,13,15,"After the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the leaders sent someone over to tell Paul and Barnabas, “Friends, if you have anything to say that will help the people, please say it.”"
Acts,13,16,"Paul got up. He motioned with his hand and said: People of Israel, and everyone else who worships God, listen!"
Acts,13,17,"The God of Israel chose our ancestors, and he let our people prosper while they were living in Egypt. Then with his mighty power he led them out,"
Acts,13,18,and for about forty years he took care of them in the desert.
Acts,13,19,He destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan and gave their land to our people.
Acts,13,20,"All this happened in about 450 years. Then God gave our people judges until the time of the prophet Samuel,"
Acts,13,21,"but the people demanded a king. So for forty years God gave them King Saul, the son of Kish from the tribe of Benjamin."
Acts,13,22,"Later, God removed Saul and let David rule in his place. God said about him, “David the son of Jesse is the kind of person who pleases me most! He does everything I want him to do.”"
Acts,13,23,"God promised that someone from David's family would come to save the people of Israel, and that one is Jesus."
Acts,13,24,"But before Jesus came, John was telling everyone in Israel to turn back to God and be baptized."
Acts,13,25,"Then, when John's work was almost done, he said, “Who do you people think I am? Do you think I am the Promised One? He will come later, and I am not good enough to untie his sandals.”"
Acts,13,26,"Now listen, you descendants of Abraham! Pay attention, all you Gentiles who are here to worship God! Listen to this message about how to be saved, because it is for everyone."
Acts,13,27,The people of Jerusalem and their leaders didn't realize who Jesus was. And they didn't understand the words of the prophets that they read each Sabbath. So they condemned Jesus just as the prophets had said.
Acts,14,1,"Paul and Barnabas spoke in the Jewish meeting place in Iconium, just as they had done at Antioch, and many Jews and Gentiles put their faith in the Lord."
Acts,14,2,But the Jews who did not have faith in him made the other Gentiles angry and turned them against the Lord's followers.
Acts,14,3,"Paul and Barnabas stayed there for a while, having faith in the Lord and bravely speaking his message. The Lord gave them the power to perform miracles and wonders, and he showed that their message about his great kindness was true."
Acts,14,4,"The people of Iconium did not know what to think. Some of them believed the Jewish group, and others believed the apostles."
Acts,14,5,"Finally, some Gentiles and Jews, together with their leaders, decided to make trouble for Paul and Barnabas and to stone them to death."
Acts,15,1,"Some people came from Judea and started teaching the Lord's followers that they could not be saved, unless they were circumcised as Moses had taught."
Acts,15,2,"This caused trouble, and Paul and Barnabas argued with them about this teaching. So it was decided to send Paul and Barnabas and a few others to Jerusalem to discuss this problem with the apostles and the church leaders."
Acts,15,3,"The men who were sent by the church went through Phoenicia and Samaria, telling how the Gentiles had turned to God. This news made the Lord's followers very happy."
Acts,15,4,"When the men arrived in Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church, including the apostles and the leaders. They told them everything God had helped them do."
Acts,15,5,"But some Pharisees had become followers of the Lord. They stood up and said, “Gentiles who have faith in the Lord must be circumcised and told to obey the Law of Moses.”"
Acts,15,6,The apostles and church leaders met to discuss this problem about Gentiles.
Acts,15,7,"They had talked it over for a long time, when Peter got up and said: My friends, you know that God decided long ago to let me be the one from your group to preach the good news to the Gentiles. God did this so that they would hear and obey him."
Acts,15,8,"He knows what is in everyone's heart. And he showed that he had chosen the Gentiles, when he gave them the Holy Spirit, just as he had given his Spirit to us."
Acts,15,9,"God treated them in the same way that he treated us. They put their faith in him, and he made their hearts pure."
Acts,15,10,Now why are you trying to make God angry by placing a heavy burden on these followers? This burden was too heavy for us or our ancestors.
Acts,15,11,"But our Lord Jesus was kind to us, and we are saved by faith in him, just as the Gentiles are."
Acts,15,12,Everyone kept quiet and listened as Barnabas and Paul told how God had given them the power to perform a lot of miracles and wonders for the Gentiles.
Acts,15,13,"After they had finished speaking, James said: My friends, listen to me!"
Acts,15,14,Simon Peter has told how God first came to the Gentiles and made some of them his own people.
Acts,15,15,"This agrees with what the prophets wrote,"
Acts,15,16,"“I, the Lord, will return and rebuild David's fallen house. I will build it from its ruins and set it up again."
Acts,15,17,"Then other nations will turn to me and be my chosen ones. I, the Lord, say this."
Acts,15,18,I promised it long ago.”
Acts,15,19,"And so, my friends, I don't think we should place burdens on the Gentiles who are turning to God."
Acts,15,20,We should simply write and tell them not to eat anything that has been offered to idols. They should be told not to eat the meat of any animal that has been strangled or that still has blood in it. They must also not commit any terrible sexual sins.
Acts,15,21,"We must remember that the Law of Moses has been preached in city after city for many years, and every Sabbath it is read when we Jews meet."
Acts,15,22,"The apostles, the leaders, and all the church members decided to send some men to Antioch along with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Silas and Judas Barsabbas, who were two leaders of the Lord's followers."
Acts,15,23,"They wrote a letter that said: We apostles and leaders send friendly greetings to all you Gentiles who are followers of the Lord in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia."
Acts,15,24,We have heard that some people from here have terribly upset you by what they said. But we did not send them!
Acts,15,25,So we met together and decided to choose some men and to send them to you along with our good friends Barnabas and Paul.
Acts,15,26,These men have risked their lives for our Lord Jesus Christ.
Acts,15,27,"We are also sending Judas and Silas, who will tell you in person the same things that we are writing."
Acts,15,28,The Holy Spirit has shown us that we should not place any extra burden on you.
Acts,15,29,"But you should not eat anything offered to idols. You should not eat any meat that still has the blood in it or any meat of any animal that has been strangled. You must also not commit any terrible sexual sins. If you follow these instructions, you will do well. We send our best wishes."
Acts,15,30,The four men left Jerusalem and went to Antioch. Then they called the church members together and gave them the letter.
Acts,15,31,"When the letter was read, everyone was pleased and greatly encouraged."
Acts,15,32,"Judas and Silas were prophets, and they spoke a long time, encouraging and helping the Lord's followers."
Acts,15,33,"The men from Jerusalem stayed on in Antioch for a while. And when they left to return to the ones who had sent them, the followers wished them well."
Acts,16,1,"Paul and Silas went back to Derbe and Lystra, where there was a follower named Timothy. His mother was also a follower. She was Jewish, and his father was Greek."
Acts,16,2,"The Lord's followers in Lystra and Iconium said good things about Timothy,"
Acts,16,3,"and Paul wanted him to go with them. But Paul first had him circumcised, because all the Jewish people around there knew that Timothy's father was Greek."
Acts,16,4,"As Paul and the others went from city to city, they told the followers what the apostles and leaders in Jerusalem had decided, and they urged them to follow these instructions."
Acts,16,5,"The churches became stronger in their faith, and each day more people put their faith in the Lord."
Acts,16,6,"Paul and his friends went through Phrygia and Galatia, but the Holy Spirit would not let them preach in Asia."
Acts,16,7,"After they arrived in Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus would not let them."
Acts,16,8,So they went on through Mysia until they came to Troas.
Acts,16,9,"During the night, Paul had a vision of someone from Macedonia who was standing there and begging him, “Come over to Macedonia and help us!”"
Acts,16,10,"After Paul had seen the vision, we began looking for a way to go to Macedonia. We were sure that God had called us to preach the good news there."
Acts,16,11,"We sailed straight from Troas to Samothrace, and the next day we arrived in Neapolis."
Acts,16,12,"From there we went to Philippi, which is a Roman colony in the first district of Macedonia. We spent several days in Philippi."
Acts,16,13,"Then on the Sabbath we went outside the city gate to a place by the river, where we thought there would be a Jewish meeting place for prayer. We sat down and talked with the women who came."
Acts,16,14,"One of them was Lydia, who was from the city of Thyatira and sold expensive purple cloth. She was a worshipper of the Lord God, and he made her willing to accept what Paul was saying."
Acts,16,15,"Then after she and her family were baptized, she kept on begging us, “If you think I really do have faith in the Lord, come and stay in my home.” Finally, we accepted her invitation."
Acts,16,16,"One day on our way to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl. She had a spirit in her that gave her the power to tell the future. By doing this she made a lot of money for her owners."
Acts,16,17,"The girl followed Paul and the rest of us and kept yelling, “These men are servants of the Most High God! They are telling you how to be saved.”"
Acts,16,18,"This went on for several days. Finally, Paul got so upset that he turned and said to the spirit, “In the name of Jesus Christ, I order you to leave this girl alone!” At once the evil spirit left her."
Acts,16,19,"When the girl's owners realized that they had lost all chances for making more money, they grabbed Paul and Silas and dragged them into court."
Acts,16,20,"They told the officials, “These Jews are upsetting our city!"
Acts,16,21,They are telling us to do things we Romans are not allowed to do.”
Acts,16,22,The crowd joined in the attack on Paul and Silas. Then the officials tore the clothes off the two men and ordered them to be beaten with a whip.
Acts,16,23,"After they had been badly beaten, they were put in jail, and the jailer was told to guard them carefully."
Acts,16,24,The jailer did as he was told. He put them deep inside the jail and chained their feet to heavy blocks of wood.
Acts,16,25,"About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing praises to God, while the other prisoners listened."
Acts,16,26,"Suddenly a strong earthquake shook the jail to its foundations. The doors opened, and the chains fell from all the prisoners."
Acts,16,27,"When the jailer woke up and saw that the doors were open, he thought that the prisoners had escaped. He pulled out his sword and was about to kill himself."
Acts,16,28,"But Paul shouted, “Don't harm yourself! No one has escaped.”"
Acts,16,29,The jailer asked for a torch and went into the jail. He was shaking all over as he knelt down in front of Paul and Silas.
Acts,16,30,"After he had led them out of the jail, he asked, “What must I do to be saved?”"
Acts,16,31,"They replied, “Have faith in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved! This is also true for everyone who lives in your home.”"
Acts,16,32,Then Paul and Silas told him and everyone else in his house about the Lord.
Acts,16,33,"While it was still night, the jailer took them to a place where he could wash their cuts and bruises. Then he and everyone in his home were baptized."
Acts,16,34,"They were very glad that they had put their faith in God. After this, the jailer took Paul and Silas to his home and gave them something to eat."
Acts,16,35,The next morning the officials sent some police with orders for the jailer to let Paul and Silas go.
Acts,16,36,"The jailer told Paul, “The officials have ordered me to set you free. Now you can leave in peace.”"
Acts,16,37,"But Paul told the police, “We are Roman citizens, and the Roman officials had us beaten in public without giving us a trial. They threw us into jail. Now do they think they can secretly send us away? No, they cannot! They will have to come here themselves and let us out.”"
Acts,16,38,"When the police told the officials that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens, the officials were afraid."
Acts,16,39,So they came and apologized. They led them out of the jail and asked them to leave town.
Acts,16,40,"But Paul and Silas went straight to the home of Lydia, where they saw the Lord's followers and encouraged them. Then they left."
Acts,17,1,"After Paul and his friends had travelled through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they went on to Thessalonica. A Jewish meeting place was in that city."
Acts,17,2,"So as usual, Paul went there to worship, and on three Sabbaths he spoke to the people. He used the Scriptures"
Acts,17,3,"to show them that the Messiah had to suffer, but that he would rise from death. Paul also told them that Jesus is the Messiah he was preaching about."
Acts,17,4,"Some of them believed what Paul had said, and they became followers with Paul and Silas. Some Gentiles and many important women also believed the message."
Acts,17,5,"The Jewish leaders were jealous and got some worthless louts who hung around the market place to start a riot in the city. They wanted to drag Paul and Silas out to the mob, and so they went straight to Jason's home."
Acts,17,6,"But when they did not find them there, they dragged out Jason and some of the Lord's followers. They took them to the city authorities and shouted, “Paul and Silas have been upsetting things everywhere. Now they have come here,"
Acts,17,7,and Jason has welcomed them into his home. All of them break the laws of the Roman Emperor by claiming that someone named Jesus is king.”
Acts,17,8,The officials and the people were upset when they heard this.
Acts,17,9,So they made Jason and the other followers pay bail before letting them go.
Acts,17,10,"That same night the Lord's followers sent Paul and Silas on to Berea, and after they arrived, they went to the Jewish meeting place."
Acts,17,11,"The people in Berea were much nicer than those in Thessalonica, and they gladly accepted the message. Day after day they studied the Scriptures to see if these things were true."
Acts,17,12,"Many of them put their faith in the Lord, including some important Greek women and several men."
Acts,17,13,"When the Jewish leaders in Thessalonica heard that Paul had been preaching God's message in Berea, they went there and caused trouble by turning the crowds against Paul."
Acts,17,14,"Straight away the followers sent Paul down to the coast, but Silas and Timothy stayed in Berea."
Acts,17,15,"Some men went with Paul as far as Athens, and then returned with instructions for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as possible."
Acts,17,16,"While Paul was waiting in Athens, he was upset to see all the idols in the city."
Acts,17,17,He went to the Jewish meeting place to speak to the Jews and to anyone who worshipped with them. Day after day he also spoke to everyone he met in the market.
Acts,17,18,"Some of them were Epicureans and some were Stoics, and they started arguing with him. People were asking, “What is this know-all trying to say?” Some even said, “Paul must be preaching about foreign gods! That's what he means when he talks about Jesus and about people rising from death.”"
Acts,17,19,"They brought Paul before a council called the Areopagus, and said, “Tell us what your new teaching is all about."
Acts,17,20,"We have heard you say some strange things, and we want to know what you mean.”"
Acts,17,21,More than anything else the people of Athens and the foreigners living there loved to hear and to talk about anything new.
Acts,17,22,"So Paul stood up in front of the council and said: People of Athens, I see that you are very religious."
Acts,17,23,"As I was going through your city and looking at the things you worship, I found an altar with the words, “To an Unknown God.” You worship this God, but you don't really know him. So I want to tell you about him."
Acts,17,24,"This God made the world and everything in it. He is Lord of heaven and earth, and he doesn't live in temples built by human hands."
Acts,17,25,"He doesn't need help from anyone. He gives life, breath, and everything else to all people."
Acts,17,26,"From one person God made all nations who live on earth, and he decided when and where every nation would be."
Acts,17,27,"God has done all this, so that we will look for him and reach out and find him. He isn't far from any of us,"
Acts,17,28,"and he gives us the power to live, to move, and to be who we are. “We are his children,” just as some of your poets have said."
Acts,17,29,"Since we are God's children, we must not think that he is like an idol made out of gold or silver or stone. He isn't like anything that humans have thought up and made."
Acts,17,30,"In the past, God forgave all this because people did not know what they were doing. But now he says that everyone everywhere must turn to him."
Acts,17,31,He has set a day when he will judge the world's people with fairness. And he has chosen the man Jesus to do the judging for him. God has given proof of this to all of us by raising Jesus from death.
Acts,17,32,"As soon as the people heard Paul say that a man had been raised from death, some of them started laughing. Others said, “We will hear you talk about this some other time.”"
Acts,17,33,"When Paul left the council meeting,"
Acts,17,34,some of the men put their faith in the Lord and went with Paul. One of them was a council member named Dionysius. A woman named Damaris and several others also put their faith in the Lord.
Acts,18,1,"Paul left Athens and went to Corinth,"
Acts,18,2,"where he met Aquila, a Jewish man from Pontus. Not long before this, Aquila had come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Emperor Claudius had ordered the Jewish people to leave Rome. Paul went to see Aquila and Priscilla"
Acts,18,3,"and found out that they were tent makers. Paul was a tent maker too. So he stayed with them, and they worked together."
Acts,18,4,"Every Sabbath, Paul went to the Jewish meeting place. He spoke to Jews and Gentiles and tried to win them over."
Acts,18,5,"But after Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, he spent all his time preaching to the Jews about Jesus the Messiah."
Acts,18,6,"Finally, they turned against him and insulted him. So he shook the dust from his clothes and told them, “Whatever happens to you will be your own fault! I am not to blame. From now on I am going to preach to the Gentiles.”"
Acts,18,7,"Paul then moved into the house of a man named Titius Justus, who worshipped God and lived next door to the Jewish meeting place."
Acts,18,8,"Crispus was the leader of the meeting place. He and everyone in his family put their faith in the Lord. Many others in Corinth also heard the message, and all the people who had faith in the Lord were baptized."
Acts,18,9,"One night, Paul had a vision, and in it the Lord said, “Don't be afraid to keep on preaching. Don't stop!"
Acts,18,10,"I am with you, and you won't be harmed. Many people in this city belong to me.”"
Acts,18,11,"Paul stayed on in Corinth for a year and a half, teaching God's message to the people."
Acts,18,12,"While Gallio was governor of Achaia, some of the Jewish leaders got together and grabbed Paul. They brought him into court"
Acts,18,13,"and said, “This man is trying to make our people worship God in a way that is against our Law!”"
Acts,18,14,"Even before Paul could speak, Gallio said, “If you were charging this man with a crime or some other wrong, I would have to listen to you."
Acts,18,15,"But since this concerns only words, names, and your own law, you will have to take care of it. I refuse to judge such matters.”"
Acts,18,16,Then he sent them out of the court.
Acts,18,17,"The crowd grabbed Sosthenes, the Jewish leader, and beat him up in front of the court. But none of this mattered to Gallio."
Acts,18,18,"After Paul had stayed for a while with the Lord's followers in Corinth, he said goodbye to them and sailed on to Syria with Aquila and Priscilla. But before he left, he had his head shaved at Cenchreae because he had made a promise to God."
Acts,18,19,"The three of them arrived in Ephesus, where Paul left Priscilla and Aquila. He then went into the Jewish meeting place to talk with the people there."
Acts,18,20,"They asked him to stay longer, but he refused."
Acts,18,21,"He said goodbye to them and told them, “If God lets me, I will come back.”"
Acts,18,22,"Paul sailed to Caesarea, where he greeted the church. Then he went on to Antioch."
Acts,18,23,"After staying there for a while, he left and visited several places in Galatia and Phrygia. He helped the followers there to become stronger in their faith."
Acts,18,24,A Jewish man named Apollos came to Ephesus. Apollos had been born in the city of Alexandria. He was a very good speaker and knew a lot about the Scriptures.
Acts,18,25,"He also knew much about the Lord's Way, and he spoke about it with great excitement. What he taught about Jesus was right, but all he knew was John's message about baptism."
Acts,18,26,"Apollos started speaking bravely in the Jewish meeting place. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him to their home and helped him understand God's Way even better."
Acts,18,27,"Apollos decided to travel through Achaia. So the Lord's followers wrote letters, encouraging the followers there to welcome him. After Apollos arrived in Achaia, he was a great help to everyone who had put their faith in the Lord Jesus because of God's kindness."
Acts,18,28,"He got into fierce arguments with the Jewish people, and in public he used the Scriptures to prove that Jesus is the Messiah."
Acts,19,1,"While Apollos was in Corinth, Paul travelled across the hill country to Ephesus, where he met some of the Lord's followers."
Acts,19,2,"He asked them, “When you put your faith in Jesus, were you given the Holy Spirit?” “No!” they answered. “We have never even heard of the Holy Spirit.”"
Acts,19,3,"“Then why were you baptized?” Paul asked. They answered, “Because of what John taught.”"
Acts,19,4,"Paul replied, “John baptized people so that they would turn to God. But he also told them that someone else was coming, and that they should put their faith in him. Jesus is the one that John was talking about.”"
Acts,19,5,"After the people heard Paul say this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus."
Acts,19,6,"Then Paul placed his hands on them. The Holy Spirit was given to them, and they spoke unknown languages and prophesied."
Acts,19,7,There were about twelve men in this group.
Acts,19,8,"For three months Paul went to the Jewish meeting place and talked bravely with the people about God's kingdom. He tried to win them over,"
Acts,19,9,but some of them were stubborn and refused to believe. In front of everyone they said terrible things about God's Way. Paul left and took the followers with him to the lecture hall of Tyrannus. He spoke there every day
Acts,19,10,"for two years, until every Jew and Gentile in Asia had heard the Lord's message."
Acts,19,11,God gave Paul the power to perform great miracles.
Acts,19,12,"People even took handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched Paul's body, and they carried them to everyone who was sick. All the sick people were healed, and the evil spirits went out."
Acts,19,13,"Some Jewish men started going around trying to force out evil spirits by using the name of the Lord Jesus. They said to the spirits, “Come out in the name of that same Jesus that Paul preaches about!”"
Acts,19,14,"Seven sons of a Jewish high priest named Sceva were doing this,"
Acts,19,15,"when an evil spirit said to them, “I know Jesus! And I have heard about Paul. But who are you?”"
Acts,19,16,"Then the man with the evil spirit jumped on them and beat them up. They ran out of the house, naked and bruised."
Acts,19,17,"When the Jews and Gentiles in Ephesus heard about this, they were so frightened that they praised the name of the Lord Jesus."
Acts,19,18,Many who were followers now started telling everyone about the evil things they had been doing.
Acts,19,19,Some who had been practising witchcraft even brought their books and burnt them in public. These books were worth about fifty thousand silver coins.
Acts,19,20,So the Lord's message spread and became even more powerful.
Acts,19,21,"After all this had happened, Paul decided to visit Macedonia and Achaia on his way to Jerusalem. Paul had said, “From there I will go on to Rome.”"
Acts,19,22,"So he sent his two helpers, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia. But he stayed on in Asia for a while."
Acts,19,23,At that time there was serious trouble because of the Lord's Way.
Acts,19,24,A silversmith named Demetrius had a business that made silver models of the temple of the goddess Artemis. Those who worked for him earned a lot of money.
Acts,19,25,"Demetrius brought together everyone who was in the same business and said: Friends, you know that we make a good living at this."
Acts,19,26,"But you have seen and heard how this man Paul is upsetting a lot of people, not only in Ephesus, but almost everywhere in Asia. He claims that the gods we humans make are not really gods at all."
Acts,19,27,"Everyone will start saying terrible things about our business. They will stop respecting the temple of the goddess Artemis, who is worshipped in Asia and all over the world. Our great goddess will be forgotten!"
Acts,19,28,"When the workers heard this, they got angry and started shouting, “Great is Artemis, the goddess of the Ephesians!”"
Acts,19,29,"Soon the whole city was in a riot, and some men grabbed Gaius and Aristarchus, who had come from Macedonia with Paul. Then everyone in the crowd rushed to the place where the town meetings were held."
Acts,19,30,"Paul wanted to go out and speak to the people, but the Lord's followers would not let him."
Acts,19,31,"A few of the local officials were friendly to Paul, and they sent someone to warn him not to go."
Acts,19,32,"Some of the people in the meeting were shouting one thing, and others were shouting something else. Everyone was completely confused, and most of them did not even know why they were there."
Acts,19,33,Several of the Jewish leaders pushed a man named Alexander to the front of the crowd and started telling him what to say. He motioned with his hand and tried to explain what was going on.
Acts,19,34,"But when the crowd saw that he was Jewish, they all shouted for two hours, “Great is Artemis, the goddess of the Ephesians!”"
Acts,19,35,"Finally, a town official made the crowd be quiet. Then he said: People of Ephesus, who in the world doesn't know that our city is the centre for worshipping the great goddess Artemis? Who doesn't know that her image which fell from heaven is here?"
Acts,19,36,"No one can deny this, and so you should calm down and not do anything foolish."
Acts,19,37,You have brought men in here who have not robbed temples or spoken against our goddess.
Acts,19,38,"If Demetrius and his workers have a case against these men, we have courts and judges. Let them take their complaints there."
Acts,19,39,"But if you want to do more than that, the matter will have to be brought before the city council."
Acts,19,40,We could easily be accused of starting a riot today. There is no excuse for it! We cannot even give a reason for this uproar.
Acts,19,41,"After saying this, he told the people to leave."
Acts,20,1,"When the riot was over, Paul sent for the followers and encouraged them. He then said goodbye to them and left for Macedonia."
Acts,20,2,"As he travelled from place to place, he encouraged the followers with many messages. Finally, he went to Greece"
Acts,20,3,"and stayed there for three months. Paul was about to sail to Syria. But some of the Jewish leaders plotted against him, so he decided to return by way of Macedonia."
Acts,20,4,"With him were Sopater, son of Pyrrhus from Berea, and Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica. Gaius from Derbe was also with him, and so were Timothy and the two Asians, Tychicus and Trophimus."
Acts,20,5,They went on ahead to Troas and waited for us there.
Acts,20,6,"After the Festival of Thin Bread, we sailed from Philippi. Five days later we met them in Troas and stayed there for a week."
Acts,20,7,On the first day of the week we met to break bread together. Paul spoke to the people until midnight because he was leaving the next morning.
Acts,20,8,"In the upstairs room where we were meeting, there were a lot of lamps."
Acts,20,9,"A young man called Eutychus was sitting on a window sill. While Paul was speaking, the young man got very sleepy. Finally, he went to sleep and fell three floors all the way down to the ground. When they picked him up, he was dead."
Acts,20,10,"Paul went down and bent over Eutychus. He took him in his arms and said, “Don't worry! He's alive.”"
Acts,20,11,"After Paul had gone back upstairs, he broke bread, and ate with us. He then spoke until dawn and left."
Acts,20,12,Then the followers took the young man home alive and were very happy.
Acts,20,13,"Paul decided to travel by land to Assos. The rest of us went on ahead by ship, and we were to take him aboard there."
Acts,20,14,"When he met us in Assos, he came aboard, and we sailed on to Mitylene."
Acts,20,15,"The next day we came to a place near Chios, and the following day we reached Samos. The day after that we sailed to Miletus."
Acts,20,16,"Paul had decided to sail on past Ephesus, because he did not want to spend too much time in Asia. He was in a hurry and wanted to be in Jerusalem in time for Pentecost."
Acts,20,17,"From Miletus, Paul sent a message for the church leaders at Ephesus to come and meet with him."
Acts,20,18,"When they got there, he said: You know everything I did during the time I was with you when I first came to Asia."
Acts,20,19,Some of the Jews plotted against me and caused me a lot of sorrow and trouble. But I served the Lord and was humble.
Acts,20,20,"When I preached in public or taught in your homes, I didn't hold back from telling anything that would help you."
Acts,20,21,I told Jews and Gentiles to turn to God and have faith in our Lord Jesus.
Acts,20,22,"I don't know what will happen to me in Jerusalem, but I must obey God's Spirit and go there."
Acts,20,23,"In every city I visit, I am told by the Holy Spirit that I will be put in jail and will be in trouble in Jerusalem."
Acts,20,24,"But I don't care what happens to me, as long as I finish the work that the Lord Jesus gave me to do. And that work is to tell the good news about God's great kindness."
Acts,20,25,"I have gone from place to place, preaching to you about God's kingdom, but now I know that none of you will ever see me again."
Acts,20,26,I tell you today that I am no longer responsible for any of you!
Acts,20,27,I have told you everything God wants you to know.
Acts,20,28,Look after yourselves and everyone the Holy Spirit has placed in your care. Be like shepherds to God's church. It is the flock that he bought with the blood of his own Son.
Acts,20,29,"I know that after I am gone, others will come like fierce wolves to attack you."
Acts,20,30,Some of your own people will tell lies to win over the Lord's followers.
Acts,20,31,Be on your guard! Remember how day and night for three years I kept warning you with tears in my eyes.
Acts,20,32,I now place you in God's care. Remember the message about his great kindness! This message can help you and give you what belongs to you as God's people.
Acts,20,33,I have never wanted anyone's money or clothes.
Acts,20,34,You know how I have worked with my own hands to make a living for myself and my friends.
Acts,20,35,"By everything I did, I showed how you should work to help everyone who is weak. Remember that our Lord Jesus said, “More blessings come from giving than from receiving.”"
Acts,20,36,"After Paul had finished speaking, he knelt down with all of them and prayed."
Acts,20,37,Everyone cried and hugged and kissed him.
Acts,20,38,"They were especially sad because Paul had told them, “You will never see me again.” Then they went with him to the ship."
Acts,21,1,"After saying goodbye, we sailed straight to Cos. The next day we reached Rhodes and from there sailed on to Patara."
Acts,21,2,"We found a ship going to Phoenicia, so we got on board and sailed off."
Acts,21,3,"We came within sight of Cyprus and then sailed south of it on to the port of Tyre in Syria, where the ship was going to unload its cargo."
Acts,21,4,We found the Lord's followers and stayed with them for a week. The Holy Spirit had told them to warn Paul not to go on to Jerusalem.
Acts,21,5,"But when the week was over, we started on our way again. All the men, together with their wives and children, walked with us from the town to the seashore. We knelt on the beach and prayed."
Acts,21,6,"Then after saying goodbye to each other, we got into the ship, and they went back home."
Acts,21,7,"We sailed from Tyre to Ptolemais, where we greeted the followers and stayed with them for a day."
Acts,21,8,"The next day we went to Caesarea and stayed with Philip, the preacher. He was one of the seven men who helped the apostles,"
Acts,21,9,and he had four unmarried daughters who prophesied.
Acts,21,10,"We had been in Caesarea for several days, when the prophet Agabus came to us from Judea."
Acts,21,11,"He took Paul's belt, and with it he tied up his own hands and feet. Then he told us, “The Holy Spirit says that some of the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem will tie up the man who owns this belt. They will also hand him over to the Gentiles.”"
Acts,21,12,"After Agabus said this, we and the followers living there begged Paul not to go to Jerusalem."
Acts,21,13,"But Paul answered, “Why are you crying and breaking my heart? I am not only willing to be put in jail for the Lord Jesus. I am even willing to die for him in Jerusalem!”"
Acts,21,14,"Since we could not get Paul to change his mind, we gave up and prayed, “Lord, please make us willing to do what you want.”"
Acts,21,15,Then we got ready to go to Jerusalem.
Acts,21,16,Some of the followers from Caesarea went with us and took us to stay in the home of Mnason. He was from Cyprus and had been a follower from the beginning.
Acts,21,17,"When we arrived in Jerusalem, the Lord's followers gladly welcomed us."
Acts,21,18,"Paul went with us to see James the next day, and all the church leaders were present."
Acts,21,19,Paul greeted them and told how God had used him to help the Gentiles.
Acts,21,20,"Everyone who heard this praised God and said to Paul: My friend, you can see how many tens of thousands of the Jewish people have become followers! And all of them are eager to obey the Law of Moses."
Acts,21,21,But they have been told that you are teaching those who live among the Gentiles to disobey this Law. They claim that you are telling them not to circumcise their sons or to follow Jewish customs.
Acts,21,22,What should we do now that our people have heard that you are here?
Acts,21,23,"Please do what we ask, because four of our men have made special promises to God."
Acts,21,24,Join with them and prepare yourself for the ceremony that goes with the promises. Pay the cost for their heads to be shaved. Then everyone will learn that the reports about you are not true. They will know that you do obey the Law of Moses.
Acts,21,25,Some while ago we told the Gentile followers what we think they should do. We instructed them not to eat anything offered to idols. They were told not to eat any meat with blood still in it or the meat of an animal that has been strangled. They were also told not to commit any terrible sexual sins.
Acts,21,26,The next day Paul took the four men with him and got himself ready at the same time they did. Then he went into the temple and told when the final ceremony would take place and when an offering would be made for each of them.
Acts,21,27,"When the period of seven days for the ceremony was almost over, some of the Jewish people from Asia saw Paul in the temple. They got a large crowd together and started attacking him."
Acts,21,28,"They were shouting, “Friends, help us! This man goes around everywhere, saying bad things about our nation and about the Law of Moses and about this temple. He has even brought shame to this holy temple by bringing in Gentiles.”"
Acts,21,29,"Some of them thought that Paul had brought Trophimus from Ephesus into the temple, because they had seen them together in the city."
Acts,21,30,"The whole city was in an uproar, and the people turned into a mob. They grabbed Paul and dragged him out of the temple. Then suddenly the doors were shut."
Acts,21,31,The people were about to kill Paul when the Roman army commander heard that all Jerusalem was starting to riot.
Acts,21,32,"So he quickly took some soldiers and officers and ran to where the crowd had gathered. As soon as the mob saw the commander and soldiers, they stopped beating Paul."
Acts,21,33,The army commander went over and arrested him and had him bound with two chains. Then he tried to find out who Paul was and what he had done.
Acts,21,34,"Part of the crowd shouted one thing, and part of them shouted something else. But they were making so much noise that the commander could not find out a thing. Then he ordered Paul to be taken into the fortress."
Acts,21,35,"As they reached the steps, the crowd became so wild that the soldiers had to lift Paul up and carry him."
Acts,21,36,"The crowd followed and kept shouting, “Kill him! Kill him!”"
Acts,21,37,"When Paul was about to be taken into the fortress, he asked the commander, “Can I say something to you?” “How do you know Greek?” the commander asked."
Acts,21,38,“Aren't you that Egyptian who started a riot not long ago and led four thousand terrorists into the desert?”
Acts,21,39,"“No!” Paul replied. “I am a Jew from Tarsus, an important city in Cilicia. Please let me speak to the crowd.”"
Acts,21,40,"The commander told him he could speak, so Paul stood on the steps and motioned to the people. When they were quiet, he spoke to them in Aramaic:"
Acts,22,1,"“My friends and leaders of our nation, listen as I explain what happened!”"
Acts,22,2,"When the crowd heard Paul speak to them in Aramaic, they became even quieter. Then Paul said:"
Acts,22,3,"I am a Jew, born and raised in the city of Tarsus in Cilicia. I was a student of Gamaliel and was taught to follow every single law of our ancestors. In fact, I was just as eager to obey God as any of you are today."
Acts,22,4,"I made trouble for everyone who followed the Lord's Way, and I even had some of them killed. I had others arrested and put in jail. I didn't care if they were men or women."
Acts,22,5,"The high priest and all the council members can tell you that this is true. They even gave me letters to the Jewish leaders in Damascus, so that I could arrest people there and bring them to Jerusalem to be punished."
Acts,22,6,"One day about midday I was getting close to Damascus, when a bright light from heaven suddenly flashed around me."
Acts,22,7,"I fell to the ground and heard a voice asking me, “Saul, Saul, why are you so cruel to me?”"
Acts,22,8,"“Who are you?” I answered. The Lord replied, “I am Jesus from Nazareth! I am the one you are so cruel to.”"
Acts,22,9,"The men who were travelling with me saw the light, but did not hear the voice."
Acts,22,10,"I asked, “Lord, what do you want me to do?” Then he told me, “Get up and go to Damascus. When you get there, you will be told what to do.”"
Acts,22,11,The light had been so bright that I couldn't see. And the other men had to lead me by the hand to Damascus.
Acts,22,12,"In that city there was a man named Ananias, who faithfully obeyed the Law of Moses and was well liked by all the Jewish people living there."
Acts,22,13,"He came to me and said, “Saul, my friend, you can now see again!” At once I could see."
Acts,22,14,"Then Ananias told me, “The God that our ancestors worshipped has chosen you to know what he wants done. He has chosen you to see the One Who Obeys God and to hear his voice."
Acts,22,15,You must tell everyone what you have seen and heard.
Acts,22,16,"What are you waiting for? Get up! Be baptized, and wash away your sins by praying to the Lord.”"
Acts,22,17,After this I returned to Jerusalem and went to the temple to pray. There I had a vision
Acts,22,18,"of the Lord who said to me, “Hurry and leave Jerusalem! The people won't listen to what you say about me.”"
Acts,22,19,"I replied, “Lord, they know that in many of our meeting places I arrested and beat people who had faith in you."
Acts,22,20,"Stephen was killed because he spoke for you, and I stood there and cheered them on. I even guarded the clothes of the men who murdered him.”"
Acts,22,21,"But the Lord told me to go, and he promised to send me far away to the Gentiles."
Acts,22,22,"The crowd listened until Paul said this. Then they started shouting, “Get rid of this man! He doesn't deserve to live.”"
Acts,22,23,They kept shouting. They waved their clothes around and threw dust into the air.
Acts,22,24,The Roman commander ordered Paul to be taken into the fortress and beaten with a whip. He did this to find out why the people were screaming at Paul.
Acts,22,25,"While the soldiers were tying Paul up to be beaten, he asked the officer standing there, “Is it legal to beat a Roman citizen before he has been tried in court?”"
Acts,22,26,"When the officer heard this, he went to the commander and said, “What are you doing? This man is a Roman citizen!”"
Acts,22,27,"The commander went to Paul and asked, “Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?” “Yes,” Paul answered."
Acts,22,28,"The commander then said, “I paid a lot of money to become a Roman citizen.” But Paul replied, “I was born a Roman citizen.”"
Acts,22,29,The men who were about to beat and question Paul quickly backed off. And the commander himself was frightened when he realized that he had put a Roman citizen in chains.
Acts,22,30,"The next day the commander wanted to know the real reason why the Jewish leaders had brought charges against Paul. So he had Paul's chains removed, and he ordered the chief priests and the whole council to meet. Then he had Paul led in and made him stand in front of them."
Acts,23,1,"Paul looked straight at the council members and said, “My friends, to this day I have served God with a clear conscience!”"
Acts,23,2,Then Ananias the high priest ordered the men standing beside Paul to hit him on the mouth.
Acts,23,3,"Paul turned to the high priest and said, “You whitewashed wall! God will hit you. You sit there to judge me by the Law of Moses. But at the same time you order men to break the Law by hitting me.”"
Acts,23,4,"The men standing beside Paul asked, “Don't you know you are insulting God's high priest?”"
Acts,23,5,"Paul replied, “Oh! I didn't know he was the high priest. The Scriptures do tell us not to speak evil about a leader of our people.”"
Acts,23,6,"When Paul saw that some of the council members were Sadducees and others were Pharisees, he shouted, “My friends, I am a Pharisee and the son of a Pharisee. I am on trial simply because I believe that the dead will be raised to life.”"
Acts,23,7,"As soon as Paul said this, the Pharisees and the Sadducees got into a big argument, and the council members started taking sides."
Acts,23,8,"The Sadducees do not believe in angels or spirits or that the dead will rise to life. But the Pharisees believe in all these,"
Acts,23,9,"and so there was a lot of shouting. Some of the teachers of the Law of Moses were Pharisees. Finally, they became angry and said, “We don't find anything wrong with this man. Perhaps a spirit or an angel really did speak to him.”"
Acts,23,10,"The argument became fierce, and the commander was afraid that Paul would be pulled apart. So he ordered the soldiers to go in and rescue Paul. Then they took him back into the fortress."
Acts,23,11,"That night the Lord stood beside Paul and said, “Don't worry! Just as you have told others about me in Jerusalem, you must also tell about me in Rome.”"
Acts,24,1,"Five days later Ananias the high priest, together with some of their leaders and a lawyer named Tertullus, went to the governor to present their case against Paul."
Acts,24,2,"So Paul was called in, and Tertullus stated the case against him: Honourable Felix, you have brought our people a long period of peace, and because of your concern our nation is much better off."
Acts,24,3,All of us are always grateful for what you have done.
Acts,24,4,"I don't want to bother you, but please be patient with us and listen to me for just a few minutes."
Acts,24,5,This man has been found to be a real pest and troublemaker for Jews all over the world. He is also a leader of a group called Nazarenes.
Acts,25,1,"Three days after Festus had become governor, he went from Caesarea to Jerusalem."
Acts,25,2,There the chief priests and some Jewish leaders told him about their charges against Paul. They also asked Festus
Acts,25,3,if he would be willing to bring Paul to Jerusalem. They begged him to do this because they were planning to attack and kill Paul on the way.
Acts,25,4,"But Festus told them, “Paul will be kept in Caesarea, and I am soon going there myself."
Acts,25,5,"If he has done anything wrong, let your leaders go with me and bring charges against him there.”"
Acts,25,6,Festus stayed in Jerusalem for eight or ten more days before going to Caesarea. Then the next day he took his place as judge and had Paul brought into court.
Acts,25,7,"As soon as Paul came in, the Jewish leaders from Jerusalem crowded around him and said he was guilty of many serious crimes. But they could not prove anything."
Acts,25,8,"Then Paul spoke in his own defence, “I have not broken the Law of my people. And I have not done anything against either the temple or the Emperor.”"
Acts,25,9,"Festus wanted to please the leaders. So he asked Paul, “Are you willing to go to Jerusalem and be tried by me on these charges?”"
Acts,25,10,"Paul replied, “I am on trial in the Emperor's court, and that's where I should be tried. You know very well that I have not done anything to harm the Jewish nation."
Acts,25,11,"If I had done something deserving death, I would not ask to escape the death penalty. But I am not guilty of any of these crimes, and no one has the right to hand me over to these people. I now ask to be tried by the Emperor himself.”"
Acts,25,12,"After Festus had talked this over with members of his council, he told Paul, “You have asked to be tried by the Emperor, and to the Emperor you will go!”"
Acts,25,13,A few days later King Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to visit Festus.
Acts,25,14,"They had been there for several days, when Festus told the king about the charges against Paul. He said: Felix left a man here in jail,"
Acts,25,15,"and when I went to Jerusalem, the chief priests and the Jewish leaders came and asked me to find him guilty."
Acts,25,16,I told them that it isn't the Roman custom to hand a man over to people who are bringing charges against him. He must first have the chance to meet them face to face and to defend himself against their charges.
Acts,25,17,"So when they came here with me, I wasted no time. On the very next day I took my place on the judge's bench and ordered him to be brought in."
Acts,25,18,"But when the men stood up to make their charges against him, they did not accuse him of any of the crimes that I thought they would."
Acts,25,19,"Instead, they argued with him about some of their beliefs and about a dead man named Jesus, who Paul said was alive."
Acts,25,20,"Since I did not know how to find out the truth about all this, I asked Paul if he would be willing to go to Jerusalem and be put on trial there."
Acts,25,21,But Paul asked to be kept in jail until the Emperor could decide his case. So I ordered him to be kept here until I could send him to the Emperor.
Acts,25,22,"Then Agrippa said to Festus, “I would also like to hear what this man has to say.” Festus answered, “You can hear him tomorrow.”"
Acts,25,23,The next day Agrippa and Bernice made a big show as they came into the meeting room. High ranking army officers and leading citizens of the town were also there. Festus then ordered Paul to be brought in
Acts,25,24,"and said: King Agrippa and other guests, look at this man! Every Jew from Jerusalem and Caesarea has come to me, demanding for him to be put to death."
Acts,25,25,"I have not found him guilty of any crime deserving death. But because he has asked to be judged by the Emperor, I have decided to send him to Rome."
Acts,25,26,"I have to write some facts about this man to the Emperor. So I have brought him before all of you, but especially before you, King Agrippa. After we have talked about his case, I will then have something to write."
Acts,25,27,It makes no sense to send a prisoner to the Emperor without stating the charges against him.
Acts,26,1,"Agrippa told Paul, “You may now speak for yourself.” Paul stretched out his hand and said:"
Acts,26,2,"King Agrippa, I am glad for this chance to defend myself before you today on all these charges that my own people have brought against me."
Acts,26,3,You know a lot about our religious customs and the beliefs that divide us. So I ask you to listen patiently to me.
Acts,27,1,"When it was time for us to sail to Rome, Captain Julius from the Emperor's special troops was put in charge of Paul and the other prisoners."
Acts,27,2,We went aboard a ship from Adramyttium that was about to sail to some ports along the coast of Asia. Aristarchus from Thessalonica in Macedonia sailed on the ship with us.
Acts,27,3,"The next day we came to shore at Sidon. Captain Julius was very kind to Paul. He even let him visit his friends, so they could give him whatever he needed."
Acts,27,4,"When we left Sidon, the winds were blowing against us, and we sailed close to the island of Cyprus to be safe from the wind."
Acts,27,5,Then we sailed south of Cilicia and Pamphylia until we came to the port of Myra in Lycia.
Acts,27,6,There the army captain found a ship from Alexandria that was going to Italy. So he ordered us to board that ship.
Acts,27,7,"We sailed along slowly for several days and had a hard time reaching Cnidus. The wind would not let us go any further in that direction, so we sailed past Cape Salmone, where the island of Crete would protect us from the wind."
Acts,27,8,"We went slowly along the coast and finally reached a place called Fair Havens, not far from the town of Lasea."
Acts,27,9,"By now we had already lost a lot of time, and sailing was no longer safe. In fact, even the Great Day of Forgiveness was past."
Acts,27,10,"Then Paul spoke to the crew of the ship, “Men, listen to me! If we sail now, our ship and its cargo will be badly damaged, and many lives will be lost.”"
Acts,27,11,"But Julius listened to the captain of the ship and its owner, rather than to Paul."
Acts,27,12,"The harbour at Fair Havens wasn't a good place to spend the winter. Because of this, almost everyone agreed that we should at least try to sail along the coast of Crete as far as Phoenix. It had a harbour that opened towards the south-west and north-west, and we could spend the winter there."
Acts,27,13,"When a gentle wind from the south started blowing, the men thought it was a good time to do what they had planned. So they pulled up the anchor, and we sailed along the coast of Crete."
Acts,27,14,But soon a strong wind called “The North-easter” blew against us from the island.
Acts,27,15,"The wind struck the ship, and we could not sail against it. So we let the wind carry the ship."
Acts,27,16,"We went along the island of Cauda on the side that was protected from the wind. We had a hard time holding the lifeboat in place,"
Acts,27,17,"but finally we got it where it belonged. Then the sailors tied ropes around the ship to hold it together. They lowered the sail and let the ship drift along, because they were afraid it might hit the sandbanks in the gulf of Syrtis."
Acts,27,18,The storm was so fierce that the next day they threw some of the ship's cargo overboard.
Acts,27,19,"Then on the third day, with their bare hands they threw overboard some of the ship's gear."
Acts,27,20,"For several days we could not see either the sun or the stars. A strong wind kept blowing, and we finally gave up all hope of being saved."
Acts,27,21,"Since none of us had eaten anything for a long time, Paul stood up and told the men: You should have listened to me! If you had stayed on in Crete, you would not have had this damage and loss."
Acts,27,22,"But now I beg you to cheer up, because you will be safe. Only the ship will be lost."
Acts,27,23,"I belong to God, and I worship him. Last night he sent an angel"
Acts,27,24,"to tell me, “Paul, don't be afraid! You will stand trial before the Emperor. And because of you, God will save the lives of everyone on the ship.”"
Acts,27,25,Cheer up! I am sure that God will do exactly what he promised.
Acts,27,26,But we will first be shipwrecked on some island.
Acts,27,27,For fourteen days and nights we had been blown around over the Mediterranean Sea. But about midnight the sailors realized that we were getting near land.
Acts,27,28,They measured and found that the water was about forty metres deep. A little later they measured again and found it was only about thirty metres.
Acts,27,29,"The sailors were afraid that we might hit some rocks, and they let down four anchors from the back of the ship. Then they prayed for daylight."
Acts,27,30,"The sailors wanted to escape from the ship. So they lowered the lifeboat into the water, pretending that they were letting down an anchor from the front of the ship."
Acts,27,31,"But Paul said to Captain Julius and the soldiers, “If the sailors don't stay on the ship, you won't have any chance to save your lives.”"
Acts,27,32,The soldiers then cut the ropes that held the lifeboat and let it fall into the sea.
Acts,27,33,"Just before daylight Paul begged the people to eat something. He told them, “For fourteen days you have been so worried that you haven't eaten a thing."
Acts,27,34,I beg you to eat something. Your lives depend on it. Do this and not one of you will be hurt.”
Acts,27,35,"After Paul had said this, he took a piece of bread and gave thanks to God. Then in front of everyone, he broke the bread and ate some."
Acts,27,36,"They all felt encouraged, and each of them ate something."
Acts,27,37,"There were 276 people on the ship,"
Acts,27,38,"and after everyone had eaten, they threw the cargo of wheat into the sea to make the ship lighter."
Acts,27,39,"Morning came, and the ship's crew saw a coast that they did not recognize. But they did see a cove with a beach. So they decided to try to run the ship aground on the beach."
Acts,27,40,"They cut the anchors loose and let them sink into the sea. At the same time they untied the ropes that were holding the rudders. Next, they raised the sail at the front of the ship and let the wind carry the ship towards the beach."
Acts,27,41,"But it ran aground on a sandbank. The front of the ship stuck firmly in the sand, and the rear was being smashed by the force of the waves."
Acts,27,42,The soldiers decided to kill the prisoners to keep them from swimming away and escaping.
Acts,27,43,"But Captain Julius wanted to save Paul's life, and he did not let the soldiers do what they had planned. Instead, he ordered everyone who could swim to dive into the water and head for shore."
Acts,27,44,"Then he told the others to hold on to planks of wood or parts of the ship. At last, everyone safely reached shore."
Acts,28,1,"When we came ashore, we learnt that the island was called Malta."
Acts,28,2,"The local people were very friendly, and they welcomed us by building a fire, because it was rainy and cold."
Acts,28,3,"After Paul had gathered some wood and had put it on the fire, the heat caused a snake to crawl out, and it bit him on the hand."
Acts,28,4,"When the local people saw the snake hanging from Paul's hand, they said to each other, “This man must be a murderer! He didn't drown in the sea, but the goddess of justice will kill him anyway.”"
Acts,28,5,Paul shook the snake off into the fire and wasn't harmed.
Acts,28,6,"The people kept thinking that Paul would either swell up or suddenly drop dead. They watched him for a long time, and when nothing happened to him, they changed their minds and said, “This man is a god.”"
Acts,28,7,"The governor of the island was named Publius, and he owned some of the land around there. Publius was very friendly and welcomed us into his home for three days."
Acts,28,8,"His father was in bed, sick with fever and stomach trouble, and Paul went to visit him. Paul healed the man by praying and placing his hands on him."
Acts,28,9,"After this happened, everyone on the island brought their sick people to Paul, and they were all healed."
Acts,28,10,"The people were very respectful to us, and when we sailed, they gave us everything we needed."
Acts,28,11,Three months later we sailed in a ship that had been docked at Malta for the winter. The ship was from Alexandria in Egypt and was known as “The Twin Gods”.
Acts,28,12,We arrived in Syracuse and stayed for three days.
Acts,28,13,"From there we sailed to Rhegium. The next day a south wind began to blow, and two days later we arrived in Puteoli."
Acts,28,14,"There we found some of the Lord's followers, who begged us to stay with them. A week later we left for the city of Rome."
Acts,28,15,"Some of the followers in Rome heard about us and came to meet us at the Market of Appius and at the Three Inns. When Paul saw them, he thanked God and was encouraged."
Acts,28,16,"We arrived in Rome, and Paul was allowed to live in a house by himself with a soldier to guard him."
Acts,28,17,"Three days after we got there, Paul called together some of the Jewish leaders and said: My friends, I have never done anything to hurt our people, and I have never gone against the customs of our ancestors. But in Jerusalem I was handed over as a prisoner to the Romans."
Acts,28,18,They looked into the charges against me and wanted to release me. They found that I had not done anything deserving death.
Acts,28,19,"The Jewish leaders disagreed, so I asked to be tried by the Emperor. But I don't have anything to say against my own nation."
Acts,28,20,I am bound by these chains because of what we people of Israel hope for. That's why I have called you here to talk about this hope of ours.
Acts,28,21,"The leaders replied, “No one from Judea has written us a letter about you. And not one of them has come here to report on you or to say anything against you."
Acts,28,22,But we would like to hear what you have to say. We understand that people everywhere are against this new group.”
Acts,28,23,"They agreed on a time to meet with Paul, and many of them came to his house. From early morning until late in the afternoon, Paul talked to them about God's kingdom. He used the Law of Moses and the Books of the Prophets to try to win them over to Jesus."
Acts,28,24,"Some of the leaders agreed with what Paul said, but others did not."
Acts,28,25,"Since they could not agree among themselves, they started leaving. But Paul said, “The Holy Spirit said the right thing when he sent Isaiah the prophet"
Acts,28,26,"to tell our ancestors, ‘Go to these people and tell them: You will listen and listen, but never understand. You will look and look, but never see."
Acts,28,27,"All of you have stubborn hearts. Your ears are stopped up, and your eyes are covered. You cannot see or hear or understand. If you could, you would turn to me, and I would heal you.’ ”"
Romans,1,1,"From Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus. God chose me to be an apostle, and he appointed me to preach the good news"
Romans,1,2,that he promised long ago by what his prophets said in the holy Scriptures.
Romans,2,1,"Some of you accuse others of doing wrong. But there is no excuse for what you do. When you judge others, you condemn yourselves, because you are guilty of doing the very same things."
Romans,2,2,We know that God is right to judge everyone who behaves in this way.
Romans,2,3,"Do you really think God won't punish you, when you behave exactly like the people you accuse?"
Romans,2,4,You don't think much of God's wonderful goodness or of his patience and willingness to put up with you. Don't you know that the reason God is good to you is because he wants you to turn to him?
Romans,2,5,But you are stubborn and refuse to turn to God. So you are making things even worse for yourselves on that day when he will show how angry he is and will judge the world with fairness.
Romans,2,6,God will reward each of us for what we have done.
Romans,2,7,"He will give eternal life to everyone who has patiently done what is good in the hope of receiving glory, honour, and life that lasts for ever."
Romans,2,8,But he will show how angry and furious he can be with every selfish person who rejects the truth and wants to do evil.
Romans,2,9,All who are wicked will be punished with trouble and suffering. It doesn't matter if they are Jews or Gentiles.
Romans,2,10,"But all who do right will be rewarded with glory, honour, and peace, whether they are Jews or Gentiles."
Romans,2,11,God doesn't have any favourites!
Romans,2,12,Those people who don't know about God's Law will still be punished for what they do wrong. And the Law will be used to judge everyone who knows what it says.
Romans,2,13,"God accepts those who obey his Law, but not those who simply hear it."
Romans,2,14,"Some people naturally obey the Law's commands, even though they don't have the Law."
Romans,2,15,"This proves that the conscience is like a law written in the human heart. And it will show whether we are forgiven or condemned,"
Romans,2,16,"when God appoints Jesus Christ to judge everyone's secret thoughts, just as my message says."
Romans,2,17,Some of you call yourselves Jews. You trust in the Law and take pride in God.
Romans,2,18,"By reading the Scriptures you learn how God wants you to behave, and you discover what is right."
Romans,2,19,You are sure that you are a guide for the blind and a light for all who are in the dark.
Romans,2,20,"And since there is knowledge and truth in God's Law, you think you can instruct fools and teach young people."
Romans,2,21,But how can you teach others when you refuse to learn? You preach that it is wrong to steal. But do you steal?
Romans,2,22,"You say people should be faithful in marriage. But are you faithful? You hate idols, yet you rob their temples."
Romans,2,23,"You take pride in the Law, but you disobey the Law and bring shame to God."
Romans,2,24,"It is just as the Scriptures tell us, “You have made foreigners say insulting things about God.”"
Romans,2,25,"Being circumcised is worthwhile, if you obey the Law. But if you don't obey the Law, you are no better off than people who are not circumcised."
Romans,2,26,"In fact, if they obey the Law, they are as good as anyone who is circumcised."
Romans,2,27,"So everyone who obeys the Law, but has never been circumcised, will condemn you. Even though you are circumcised and have the Law, you still don't obey its teachings."
Romans,2,28,Just because you live like a Jew and are circumcised doesn't make you a real Jew.
Romans,2,29,"To be a real Jew you must obey the Law. True circumcision is something that happens deep in your heart, not something done to your body. And besides, you should want praise from God and not from humans."
Romans,3,1,What good is it to be a Jew? What good is it to be circumcised?
Romans,3,2,"It is good in a lot of ways! First of all, God's messages were spoken to the Jews."
Romans,3,3,"It is true that some of them did not believe the message. But does this mean that God cannot be trusted, just because they did not have faith?"
Romans,3,4,"No, indeed! God tells the truth, even if everyone else is a liar. The Scriptures say about God, “Your words will be proved true, and in court you will win your case.”"
Romans,3,5,"If our evil deeds show how right God is, then what can we say? Is it wrong for God to become angry and punish us? What a foolish thing to ask."
Romans,3,6,"But the answer is, “No.” Otherwise, how could God judge the world?"
Romans,3,7,"Since your lies bring great honour to God by showing how truthful he is, you may ask why God still says you are a sinner."
Romans,3,8,"You might as well say, “Let's do something evil, so that something good will come of it!” Some people even claim that we are saying this. But God is fair and will judge them as well."
Romans,3,9,"What does all this mean? Does it mean that we Jews are better off than the Gentiles? No, it doesn't! Jews, as well as Gentiles, are ruled by sin, just as I have said."
Romans,3,10,"The Scriptures tell us, “No one is acceptable to God!"
Romans,3,11,Not one of them understands or even searches for God.
Romans,3,12,They have all turned away and are worthless. There isn't one person who does right.
Romans,3,13,"Their words are like an open pit, and their tongues are good only for telling lies. Each word is as deadly as the fangs of a snake,"
Romans,3,14,and they say nothing but bitter curses.
Romans,3,15,These people quickly become violent.
Romans,3,16,"Wherever they go, they leave ruin and destruction."
Romans,3,17,They don't know how to live in peace.
Romans,3,18,They don't even fear God.”
Romans,3,19,We know that everything in the Law was written for those who are under its power. The Law says these things to stop anyone from making excuses and to let God show that the whole world is guilty.
Romans,3,20,"God doesn't accept people simply because they obey the Law. No, indeed! All the Law does is to point out our sin."
Romans,3,21,"Now we see how God does make us acceptable to him. The Law and the Prophets tell how we become acceptable, and it isn't by obeying the Law of Moses."
Romans,3,22,God treats everyone alike. He accepts people only because they have faith in Jesus Christ.
Romans,3,23,All of us have sinned and fallen short of God's glory.
Romans,3,24,"But God treats us much better than we deserve, and because of Christ Jesus, he freely accepts us and sets us free from our sins."
Romans,4,1,"Well then, what can we say about our ancestor Abraham?"
Romans,4,2,"If he became acceptable to God because of what he did, then he would have something to boast about. But he would never be able to boast about it to God."
Romans,4,3,"The Scriptures say, “God accepted Abraham because Abraham had faith in him.”"
Romans,4,4,Money paid to workers isn't a gift. It is something they earn by working.
Romans,4,5,But you cannot make God accept you because of something you do. God accepts sinners only because they have faith in him.
Romans,4,6,"In the Scriptures David talks about the blessings that come to people who are acceptable to God, even though they don't do anything to deserve these blessings. David says,"
Romans,4,7,“God blesses people whose sins are forgiven and whose evil deeds are forgotten.
Romans,4,8,The Lord blesses people whose sins are erased from his book.”
Romans,4,9,"Are these blessings meant for circumcised people or for those who are not circumcised? Well, the Scriptures say that God accepted Abraham because Abraham had faith in him."
Romans,4,10,"But when did this happen? Was it before or after Abraham was circumcised? Of course, it was before."
Romans,4,11,"Abraham let himself be circumcised to show that he had been accepted because of his faith even before he was circumcised. This makes Abraham the father of all who are acceptable to God because of their faith, even though they are not circumcised."
Romans,4,12,"This also makes Abraham the father of everyone who is circumcised and has faith in God, as Abraham did before he was circumcised."
Romans,4,13,"God promised Abraham and his descendants that he would give them the world. This promise wasn't made because Abraham had obeyed a law, but because his faith in God made him acceptable."
Romans,4,14,"If Abraham and his descendants were given this promise because they had obeyed a law, then faith would mean nothing, and the promise would be worthless."
Romans,4,15,"God becomes angry when his Law is broken. But where there isn't a law, it cannot be broken."
Romans,4,16,"Everything depends on having faith in God, so that God's promise is assured by his great kindness. This promise isn't only for Abraham's descendants who have the Law. It is for all who are Abraham's descendants because they have faith, just as he did. Abraham is the ancestor of us all."
Romans,4,17,"The Scriptures say that Abraham would become the ancestor of many nations. This promise was made to Abraham because he had faith in God, who raises the dead to life and creates new things."
Romans,4,18,"God promised Abraham a lot of descendants. And when it all seemed hopeless, Abraham still had faith in God and became the ancestor of many nations."
Romans,4,19,"Abraham's faith never became weak, not even when he was nearly a hundred years old. He knew that he was almost dead and that his wife Sarah could not have children."
Romans,4,20,"But Abraham never doubted or questioned God's promise. His faith made him strong, and he gave all the credit to God."
Romans,4,21,Abraham was certain that God could do what he had promised.
Romans,4,22,"So God accepted him,"
Romans,4,23,just as we read in the Scriptures. But these words were not written only for Abraham.
Romans,4,24,"They were written for us, since we will also be accepted because of our faith in God, who raised our Lord Jesus to life."
Romans,4,25,"God gave Jesus to die for our sins, and he raised him to life, so that we would be made acceptable to God."
Romans,5,1,"By faith we have been made acceptable to God. And now, because of our Lord Jesus Christ, we live at peace with God."
Romans,5,2,"Christ has also introduced us to God's undeserved kindness on which we take our stand. So we are happy, as we look forward to sharing in the glory of God."
Romans,5,3,"But that's not all! We gladly suffer, because we know that suffering helps us to endure."
Romans,5,4,"And endurance builds character, which gives us a hope"
Romans,5,5,"that will never disappoint us. All this happens because God has given us the Holy Spirit, who fills our hearts with his love."
Romans,5,6,Christ died for us at a time when we were helpless and sinful.
Romans,5,7,"No one is really willing to die for an honest person, though someone might be willing to die for a truly good person."
Romans,5,8,"But God showed how much he loved us by having Christ die for us, even though we were sinful."
Romans,5,9,"But there is more! Now that God has accepted us because Christ sacrificed his life's blood, we will also be kept safe from God's anger."
Romans,5,10,"Even when we were God's enemies, he made peace with us, because his Son died for us. Yet something even greater than friendship is ours. Now that we are at peace with God, we will be saved by his Son's life."
Romans,5,11,"And in addition to everything else, we are happy because God sent our Lord Jesus Christ to make peace with us."
Romans,5,12,"Adam sinned, and that sin brought death into the world. Now everyone has sinned, and so everyone must die."
Romans,5,13,"Sin was in the world before the Law came. But no record of sin was kept, because there was no Law."
Romans,5,14,"Yet death still had power over all who lived from the time of Adam to the time of Moses. This happened, though not everyone disobeyed a direct command from God, as Adam did. In some ways Adam is like Christ who came later."
Romans,5,15,"But the gift that God was kind enough to give was very different from Adam's sin. That one sin brought death to many others. Yet in an even greater way, Jesus Christ alone brought God's gift of kindness to many people."
Romans,5,16,"There is a lot of difference between Adam's sin and God's gift. That one sin led to punishment. But God's gift made it possible for us to be acceptable to him, even though we have sinned many times."
Romans,5,17,"Death ruled like a king because Adam had sinned. But that cannot compare with what Jesus Christ has done. God has been so kind to us, and he has accepted us because of Jesus. And so we will live and rule like kings."
Romans,5,18,"Everyone was going to be punished because Adam sinned. But because of the good thing that Christ has done, God accepts us and gives us the gift of life."
Romans,5,19,Adam disobeyed God and caused many others to be sinners. But Jesus obeyed him and will make many people acceptable to God.
Romans,5,20,"The Law came, so that the full power of sin could be seen. Yet where sin was powerful, God's kindness was even more powerful."
Romans,5,21,"Sin ruled by means of death. But God's kindness now rules, and God has accepted us because of Jesus Christ our Lord. This means that we will have eternal life."
Romans,6,1,"What should we say? Should we keep on sinning, so that God's wonderful kindness will show up even better?"
Romans,6,2,"No, we should not! If we are dead to sin, how can we go on sinning?"
Romans,6,3,Don't you know that all who share in Christ Jesus by being baptized also share in his death?
Romans,6,4,"When we were baptized, we died and were buried with Christ. We were baptized, so that we would live a new life, as Christ was raised to life by the glory of God the Father."
Romans,6,5,"If we shared in Jesus' death by being baptized, we will be raised to life with him."
Romans,6,6,"We know that the persons we used to be were nailed to the cross with Jesus. This was done, so that our sinful bodies would no longer be the slaves of sin."
Romans,6,7,We know that sin doesn't have power over dead people.
Romans,6,8,"As we died with Christ, we believe we will also live with him."
Romans,6,9,"We know that death no longer has any power over Christ. He died and was raised to life, never again to die."
Romans,6,10,"When Christ died, he died for sin once and for all. But now he is alive, and he lives only for God."
Romans,6,11,"In the same way, you must think of yourselves as dead to the power of sin. But Christ Jesus has given life to you, and you live for God."
Romans,6,12,"Don't let sin rule your body. After all, your body is bound to die, so don't obey its desires"
Romans,6,13,"or let any part of it become a slave of evil. Give yourselves to God, as people who have been raised from death to life. Make every part of your body a slave that pleases God."
Romans,6,14,Don't let sin keep ruling your lives. You are ruled by God's kindness and not by the Law.
Romans,6,15,"What does all this mean? Does it mean we are free to sin, because we are ruled by God's wonderful kindness and not by the Law? Certainly not!"
Romans,6,16,"Don't you know that you are slaves of anyone you obey? You can be slaves of sin and die, or you can be obedient slaves of God and be acceptable to him."
Romans,6,17,You used to be slaves of sin. But I thank God that with all your heart you obeyed the teaching you received from me.
Romans,6,18,Now you are set free from sin and are slaves who please God.
Romans,6,19,"I am using these everyday examples, because in some ways you are still weak. You used to let the different parts of your body be slaves of your evil thoughts. But now you must make every part of your body serve God, so that you will belong completely to him."
Romans,6,20,"When you were slaves of sin, you didn't have to please God."
Romans,6,21,"But what good did you receive from the things you did? All you have to show for them is your shame, and they lead to death."
Romans,6,22,"Now you have been set free from sin, and you are God's slaves. This will make you holy and will lead you to eternal life."
Romans,6,23,The reward for sin is death. But God's gift is eternal life given by Jesus Christ our Lord.
Romans,7,1,"My friends, you understand enough about law to know that laws only have power over people who are alive."
Romans,7,2,"For example, the Law says that a man's wife must remain his wife as long as he lives. But once her husband is dead, she is free"
Romans,7,3,"to marry someone else. However, if she goes off with another man while her husband is still alive, she is said to be unfaithful."
Romans,7,4,"That is how it is with you, my friends. You are now part of the body of Christ and are dead to the power of the Law. You are free to belong to Christ, who was raised to life so that we could serve God."
Romans,7,5,"When we thought only of ourselves, the Law made us have sinful desires. It made every part of our bodies into slaves who are doomed to die."
Romans,7,6,"But the Law no longer rules over us. We are like dead people, and it cannot have any power over us. Now we can serve God in a new way by obeying his Spirit, and not in the old way by obeying the written Law."
Romans,7,7,"Does this mean that the Law is sinful? Certainly not! But if it had not been for the Law, I would not have known what sin is really like. For example, I would not have known what it means to want something that belongs to someone else, unless the Law had told me not to do that."
Romans,7,8,"It was sin that used this command as a way of making me have all kinds of desires. But without the Law, sin is dead."
Romans,7,9,"Before I knew about the Law, I was alive. But as soon as I heard that command, sin came to life,"
Romans,7,10,"and I died. The very command that was supposed to bring life to me, instead brought death."
Romans,7,11,"Sin used this command to trick me, and because of it I died."
Romans,7,12,"Still, the Law and its commands are holy and correct and good."
Romans,7,13,Am I saying that something good caused my death? Certainly not! It was sin that killed me by using something good. Now we can see how terrible and evil sin really is.
Romans,7,14,"We know that the Law is spiritual. But I am merely a human, and I have been sold as a slave to sin."
Romans,7,15,"In fact, I don't understand why I act the way I do. I don't do what I know is right. I do the things I hate."
Romans,7,16,"Although I don't do what I know is right, I agree that the Law is good."
Romans,7,17,So I am not the one doing these evil things. The sin that lives in me is what does them.
Romans,7,18,"I know that my selfish desires won't let me do anything that is good. Even when I want to do right, I cannot."
Romans,7,19,"Instead of doing what I know is right, I do wrong."
Romans,7,20,"And so, if I don't do what I know is right, I am no longer the one doing these evil things. The sin that lives in me is what does them."
Romans,7,21,The Law has shown me that something in me keeps me from doing what I know is right.
Romans,7,22,With my whole heart I agree with the Law of God.
Romans,7,23,"But in every part of me I discover something fighting against my mind, and it makes me a prisoner of sin that controls everything I do."
Romans,7,24,What a miserable person I am. Who will rescue me from this body that is doomed to die?
Romans,7,25,"Thank God! Jesus Christ will rescue me. So with my mind I serve the Law of God, although my selfish desires make me serve the law of sin."
Romans,8,1,"If you belong to Christ Jesus, you won't be punished."
Romans,8,2,The Holy Spirit will give you life that comes from Christ Jesus and will set you free from sin and death.
Romans,8,3,"The Law of Moses cannot do this, because our selfish desires make the Law weak. But God set you free when he sent his own Son to be like us sinners and to be a sacrifice for our sin. God used Christ's body to condemn sin."
Romans,8,4,"He did this, so that we would do what the Law commands by obeying the Spirit instead of our own desires."
Romans,8,5,People who are ruled by their desires think only of themselves. Everyone who is ruled by the Holy Spirit thinks about spiritual things.
Romans,8,6,"If our minds are ruled by our desires, we will die. But if our minds are ruled by the Spirit, we will have life and peace."
Romans,8,7,"Our desires fight against God, because they do not and cannot obey God's laws."
Romans,8,8,"If we follow our desires, we cannot please God."
Romans,8,9,"You are no longer ruled by your desires, but by God's Spirit, who lives in you. People who don't have the Spirit of Christ in them don't belong to him."
Romans,8,10,"But Christ lives in you. So you are alive because God has accepted you, even though your bodies must die because of your sins."
Romans,8,11,"Yet God raised Jesus to life! God's Spirit now lives in you, and he will raise you to life by his Spirit."
Romans,8,12,"My dear friends, we must not live to satisfy our desires."
Romans,8,13,"If you do, you will die. But you will live, if by the help of God's Spirit you say “No” to your desires."
Romans,8,14,Only those people who are led by God's Spirit are his children.
Romans,8,15,"God's Spirit doesn't make us slaves who are afraid of him. Instead, we become his children and call him our Father."
Romans,8,16,God's Spirit makes us sure that we are his children.
Romans,8,17,"His Spirit lets us know that together with Christ we will be given what God has promised. We will also share in the glory of Christ, because we have suffered with him."
Romans,8,18,I am sure that what we are suffering now cannot compare with the glory that will be shown to us.
Romans,8,19,"In fact, all creation is eagerly waiting for God to show who his children are."
Romans,8,20,"Meanwhile, creation is confused, but not because it wants to be confused. God made it this way in the hope"
Romans,8,21,that creation would be set free from decay and would share in the glorious freedom of his children.
Romans,8,22,"We know that all creation is still groaning and is in pain, like a woman about to give birth."
Romans,8,23,"The Spirit makes us sure about what we will be in the future. But now we groan silently, while we wait for God to show that we are his children. This means that our bodies will also be set free."
Romans,8,24,"And this hope is what saves us. But if we already have what we hope for, there is no need to keep on hoping."
Romans,8,25,"However, we hope for something we have not yet seen, and we patiently wait for it."
Romans,8,26,"In certain ways we are weak, but the Spirit is here to help us. For example, when we don't know what to pray for, the Spirit prays for us in ways that cannot be put into words."
Romans,8,27,"All our thoughts are known to God. He can understand what is in the mind of the Spirit, as the Spirit prays for God's people."
Romans,8,28,"We know that God is always at work for the good of everyone who loves him. They are the ones God has chosen for his purpose,"
Romans,8,29,"and he has always known who his chosen ones would be. He had decided to let them become like his own Son, so that his Son would be the first of many children."
Romans,8,30,"God then accepted the people he had already decided to choose, and he has shared his glory with them."
Romans,8,31,"What can we say about all this? If God is on our side, can anyone be against us?"
Romans,8,32,"God did not keep back his own Son, but he gave him for us. If God did this, won't he freely give us everything else?"
Romans,8,33,"If God says his chosen ones are acceptable to him, can anyone bring charges against them?"
Romans,8,34,"Or can anyone condemn them? No indeed! Christ died and was raised to life, and now he is at God's right side, speaking to him for us."
Romans,8,35,"Can anything separate us from the love of Christ? Can trouble, suffering, and hard times, or hunger and nakedness, or danger and death?"
Romans,8,36,"It is exactly as the Scriptures say, “For you we face death all day long. We are like sheep on their way to be butchered.”"
Romans,8,37,In everything we have won more than a victory because of Christ who loves us.
Romans,8,38,"I am sure that nothing can separate us from God's love—not life or death, not angels or spirits, not the present or the future,"
Romans,8,39,and not powers above or powers below. Nothing in all creation can separate us from God's love for us in Christ Jesus our Lord!
Romans,9,1,"I am a follower of Christ, and the Holy Spirit is a witness to my conscience. So I tell the truth and I am not lying when I say"
Romans,9,2,my heart is broken and I am in great sorrow.
Romans,9,3,I would gladly be placed under God's curse and be separated from Christ for the good of my own people.
Romans,9,4,"They are the descendants of Israel, and they are also God's chosen people. God showed them his glory. He made agreements with them and gave them his Law. The temple is theirs and so are the promises that God made to them."
Romans,9,5,"They have those famous ancestors, who were also the ancestors of Jesus Christ. I pray that God, who rules over all, will be praised for ever! Amen."
Romans,9,6,"It cannot be said that God broke his promise. After all, not all the people of Israel are the true people of God."
Romans,10,1,"Dear friends, my greatest wish and my prayer to God is for the people of Israel to be saved."
Romans,10,2,"I know they love God, but they don't understand"
Romans,10,3,"what makes people acceptable to him. So they refuse to trust God, and they try to be acceptable by obeying the Law."
Romans,10,4,But Christ makes the Law no longer necessary for those who become acceptable to God by faith.
Romans,10,5,"Moses said that a person could become acceptable to God by obeying the Law. He did this when he wrote, “If you want to live, you must do all that the Law commands.”"
Romans,10,6,"But people whose faith makes them acceptable to God will never ask, “Who will go up to heaven to bring Christ down?”"
Romans,10,7,"Neither will they ask, “Who will go down into the world of the dead to raise him to life?”"
Romans,10,8,"All who are acceptable because of their faith simply say, “The message is as near as your mouth or your heart.” And this is the same message we preach about faith."
Romans,10,9,"So you will be saved, if you honestly say, “Jesus is Lord”, and if you believe with all your heart that God raised him from death."
Romans,10,10,"God will accept you and save you, if you truly believe this and tell it to others."
Romans,10,11,"The Scriptures say that no one who has faith will be disappointed,"
Romans,10,12,"no matter if that person is a Jew or a Gentile. There is only one Lord, and he is generous to everyone who asks for his help."
Romans,10,13,All who call out to the Lord will be saved.
Romans,10,14,"How can people have faith in the Lord and ask him to save them, if they have never heard about him? And how can they hear, unless someone tells them?"
Romans,10,15,And how can anyone tell them without being sent by the Lord? The Scriptures say it is a beautiful sight to see even the feet of someone coming to preach the good news.
Romans,10,16,"Yet not everyone has believed the message. For example, the prophet Isaiah asked, “Lord, has anyone believed what we said?”"
Romans,10,17,No one can have faith without hearing the message about Christ.
Romans,10,18,"But am I saying that the people of Israel did not hear? No, I am not! The Scriptures say, “The message was told everywhere on earth. It was announced all over the world.”"
Romans,10,19,"Did the people of Israel understand or not? Moses answered this question when he told that the Lord had said, “I will make Israel jealous of people who are a nation of nobodies. I will make them angry with people who don't understand a thing.”"
Romans,10,20,"Isaiah was fearless enough to tell that the Lord had said, “I was found by people who were not looking for me. I appeared to the ones who were not asking about me.”"
Romans,10,21,"And Isaiah said about the people of Israel, “All day long the Lord has reached out to people who are stubborn and refuse to obey.”"
Romans,11,1,"Am I saying that God has turned his back on his people? Certainly not! I am one of the people of Israel, and I myself am a descendant of Abraham from the tribe of Benjamin."
Romans,11,2,God did not turn his back on his chosen people. Don't you remember reading in the Scriptures how Elijah complained to God about the people of Israel?
Romans,11,3,"He said, “Lord, they killed your prophets and destroyed your altars. I am the only one left, and now they want to kill me.”"
Romans,11,4,"But the Lord told Elijah, “I still have seven thousand followers who have not worshipped Baal.”"
Romans,11,5,"It is the same way now. God was kind to the people of Israel, and so a few of them are still his followers."
Romans,11,6,This happened because of God's undeserved kindness and not because of anything they have done. It could not have happened except for God's kindness.
Romans,11,7,"This means that only a chosen few of the people of Israel found what all of them were searching for. And the rest of them were stubborn,"
Romans,11,8,"just as the Scriptures say, “God made them so stupid that their eyes are blind, and their ears are still deaf.”"
Romans,11,9,"Then David said, “Turn their meals into bait for a trap, so that they will stumble and be given what they deserve."
Romans,11,10,Blindfold their eyes! Don't let them see. Bend their backs beneath a burden that will never be lifted.”
Romans,11,11,"Do I mean that the people of Israel fell, never to get up again? Certainly not! Their failure made it possible for the Gentiles to be saved, and this will make the people of Israel jealous."
Romans,11,12,"But if the rest of the world's people were helped so much by Israel's sin and loss, they will be helped even more by their full return."
Romans,11,13,"I am now speaking to you Gentiles, and as long as I am an apostle to you, I will take pride in my work."
Romans,11,14,I hope in this way to make some of my own people jealous enough to be saved.
Romans,11,15,"When Israel rejected God, the rest of the people in the world were able to turn to him. So when God makes friends with Israel, it will be like bringing the dead back to life."
Romans,11,16,"If part of a batch of dough is made holy by being offered to God, then all the dough is holy. If the roots of a tree are holy, the rest of the tree is holy too."
Romans,11,17,"You Gentiles are like branches of a wild olive tree that were made to be part of a cultivated olive tree. You have taken the place of some branches that were cut away from it. And because of this, you enjoy the blessings that come from being part of that cultivated tree."
Romans,11,18,But don't think you are better than the branches that were cut away. Just remember that you are not supporting the roots of that tree. Its roots are supporting you.
Romans,11,19,"Perhaps you think those branches were cut away, so that you could be put in their place."
Romans,11,20,"That's true enough. But they were cut away because they did not have faith, and you are where you are because you do have faith. So don't be proud, but be afraid."
Romans,11,21,"If God cut away those natural branches, couldn't he do the same to you?"
Romans,11,22,"Now you see both how kind and how hard God can be. He was hard on those who fell, but he was kind to you. And he will keep on being kind to you, if you keep on trusting in his kindness. Otherwise, you will be cut away too."
Romans,11,23,"If those other branches will start having faith, they will be made a part of that tree again. God has the power to put them back."
Romans,11,24,"After all, it wasn't natural for branches to be cut from a wild olive tree and to be made part of a cultivated olive tree. So it is much more likely that God will join the natural branches back to the cultivated olive tree."
Romans,11,25,"My friends, I don't want you Gentiles to be too proud of yourselves. So I will explain the mystery of what has happened to the people of Israel. Some of them have become stubborn, and they will stay like that until the complete number of you Gentiles has come in."
Romans,11,26,"In this way all Israel will be saved, as the Scriptures say, “From Zion someone will come to rescue us. Then Jacob's descendants will stop being evil."
Romans,11,27,This is what the Lord has promised to do when he forgives their sins.”
Romans,11,28,"The people of Israel are treated as God's enemies, so that the good news can come to you Gentiles. But they are still the chosen ones, and God loves them because of their famous ancestors."
Romans,11,29,God doesn't take back the gifts he has given or forget about the people he has chosen.
Romans,11,30,"At one time you Gentiles rejected God. But now Israel has rejected God, and you have been shown mercy."
Romans,11,31,"And because of the mercy shown to you, they will also be shown mercy."
Romans,11,32,"All people have disobeyed God, and that's why he treats them as prisoners. But he does this, so that he can have mercy on all of them."
Romans,11,33,Who can measure the wealth and wisdom and knowledge of God? Who can understand his decisions or explain what he does?
Romans,11,34,“Has anyone known the thoughts of the Lord or given him advice?
Romans,11,35,Has anyone loaned something to the Lord that must be repaid?”
Romans,11,36,Everything comes from the Lord. All things were made because of him and will return to him. Praise the Lord for ever! Amen.
Romans,12,1,"Dear friends, God is good. So I beg you to offer your bodies to him as a living sacrifice, pure and pleasing. That's the most sensible way to serve God."
Romans,12,2,"Don't be like the people of this world, but let God change the way you think. Then you will know how to do everything that is good and pleasing to him."
Romans,12,3,"I realize how kind God has been to me, and so I tell each of you not to think you are better than you really are. Use good sense and measure yourself by the amount of faith that God has given you."
Romans,12,4,"A body is made up of many parts, and each of them has its own use."
Romans,12,5,"That's how it is with us. There are many of us, but we are each part of the body of Christ, as well as part of one another."
Romans,12,6,"God has also given each of us different gifts to use. If we can prophesy, we should do it according to the amount of faith we have."
Romans,12,7,"If we can serve others, we should serve. If we can teach, we should teach."
Romans,12,8,"If we can encourage others, we should encourage them. If we can give, we should be generous. If we are leaders, we should do our best. If we are good to others, we should do it cheerfully."
Romans,12,9,Be sincere in your love for others. Hate everything that is evil and hold tight to everything that is good.
Romans,12,10,Love each other as brothers and sisters and honour others more than you do yourself.
Romans,12,11,Never give up. Eagerly follow the Holy Spirit and serve the Lord.
Romans,12,12,Let your hope make you glad. Be patient in time of trouble and never stop praying.
Romans,12,13,Take care of God's needy people and welcome strangers into your home.
Romans,12,14,Ask God to bless everyone who ill-treats you. Ask him to bless them and not to curse them.
Romans,12,15,"When others are happy, be happy with them, and when they are sad, be sad."
Romans,12,16,Be friendly with everyone. Don't be proud and feel that you are cleverer than others. Make friends with ordinary people.
Romans,12,17,"Don't ill-treat someone who has ill-treated you. But try to earn the respect of others,"
Romans,12,18,and do your best to live at peace with everyone.
Romans,12,19,"Dear friends, don't try to get even. Let God take revenge. In the Scriptures the Lord says, “I am the one to take revenge and pay them back.”"
Romans,12,20,"The Scriptures also say, “If your enemies are hungry, give them something to eat. And if they are thirsty, give them something to drink. This will be the same as piling burning coals on their heads.”"
Romans,12,21,"Don't let evil defeat you, but defeat evil with good."
Romans,13,1,"Obey the rulers who have authority over you. Only God can give authority to anyone, and he puts these rulers in their places of power."
Romans,13,2,"People who oppose the authorities are opposing what God has done, and they will be punished."
Romans,13,3,"Rulers are a threat to evil people, not to good people. There is no need to be afraid of the authorities. Just do right, and they will praise you for it."
Romans,13,4,"After all, they are God's servants, and it is their duty to help you. If you do something wrong, you ought to be afraid, because these rulers have the right to punish you. They are God's servants who punish criminals to show how angry God is."
Romans,13,5,"But you should obey the rulers because you know it is the right thing to do, and not just because of God's anger."
Romans,13,6,"You must also pay your taxes. The authorities are God's servants, and it is their duty to take care of these matters."
Romans,13,7,"Pay all that you owe, whether it is taxes and fees or respect and honour."
Romans,13,8,"Let love be your only debt! If you love others, you have done all that the Law demands."
Romans,13,9,"In the Law there are many commands, such as, “Be faithful in marriage. Do not murder. Do not steal. Do not want what belongs to others.” But all these are summed up in the command that says, “Love others as much as you love yourself.”"
Romans,13,10,No one who loves others will harm them. So love is all that the Law demands.
Romans,13,11,"You know what sort of times we live in, and so you should live properly. It is time to wake up. You know that the day when we will be saved is nearer now than when we first put our faith in the Lord."
Romans,13,12,"Night is almost over, and day will soon appear. We must stop behaving as people do in the dark and be ready to live in the light."
Romans,13,13,"So behave properly, as people do in the day. Don't go to wild parties or get drunk or be vulgar or indecent. Don't quarrel or be jealous."
Romans,13,14,Let the Lord Jesus Christ be as near to you as the clothes you wear. Then you won't try to satisfy your selfish desires.
Romans,14,1,"Welcome all the Lord's followers, even those whose faith is weak. Don't criticize them for having beliefs that are different from yours."
Romans,14,2,"Some think it is all right to eat anything, while those whose faith is weak will eat only vegetables."
Romans,14,3,"But you should not criticize others for eating or for not eating. After all, God welcomes everyone."
Romans,14,4,"What right do you have to criticize someone else's servants? Only their Lord can decide if they are doing right, and the Lord will make sure that they do right."
Romans,14,5,Some of the Lord's followers think one day is more important than another. Others think all days are the same. But each of you should make up your own mind.
Romans,14,6,"Any followers who count one day more important than another day do it to honour their Lord. And any followers who eat meat give thanks to God, just like the ones who don't eat meat."
Romans,14,7,"Whether we live or die, it must be for God, rather than for ourselves."
Romans,14,8,"Whether we live or die, it must be for the Lord. Alive or dead, we still belong to the Lord."
Romans,14,9,"This is because Christ died and rose to life, so that he would be the Lord of the dead and of the living."
Romans,14,10,Why do you criticize other followers of the Lord? Why do you look down on them? The day is coming when God will judge all of us.
Romans,14,11,"In the Scriptures God says, “I swear by my very life that everyone will kneel down and praise my name!”"
Romans,14,12,"And so, each of us must give an account to God for what we do."
Romans,14,13,We must stop judging others. We must also make up our minds not to upset anyone's faith.
Romans,14,14,"The Lord Jesus has made it clear to me that God considers all foods fit to eat. But if you think some foods are unfit to eat, then for you they are not fit."
Romans,14,15,"If you are hurting others by the foods you eat, you are not guided by love. Don't let your appetite destroy someone Christ died for."
Romans,14,16,Don't let your right to eat bring shame to Christ.
Romans,14,17,"God's kingdom isn't about eating and drinking. It is about pleasing God, about living in peace, and about true happiness. All this comes from the Holy Spirit."
Romans,14,18,"If you serve Christ in this way, you will please God and be respected by people."
Romans,14,19,We should try to live at peace and help each other have a strong faith.
Romans,14,20,"Don't let your appetite destroy what God has done. All foods are fit to eat, but it is wrong to cause problems for others by what you eat."
Romans,14,21,It is best not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything else that causes problems for other followers of the Lord.
Romans,14,22,"What you believe about these things should be kept between you and God. You are fortunate, if your actions don't make you have doubts."
Romans,14,23,"But if you do have doubts about what you eat, you are going against your beliefs. And you know that is wrong, because anything you do against your beliefs is sin."
Romans,15,1,"If our faith is strong, we should be patient with the Lord's followers whose faith is weak. We should try to please them instead of ourselves."
Romans,15,2,We should think of their good and try to help them by doing what pleases them.
Romans,15,3,"Even Christ did not try to please himself. But as the Scriptures say, “The people who insulted you also insulted me.”"
Romans,15,4,And the Scriptures were written to teach and encourage us by giving us hope.
Romans,15,5,"God is the one who makes us patient and cheerful. I pray that he will help you live at peace with each other, as you follow Christ."
Romans,15,6,"Then all of you together will praise God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ."
Romans,15,7,"Honour God by accepting each other, as Christ has accepted you."
Romans,15,8,"I tell you that Christ came as a servant of the Jews to show that God has kept the promises he made to their famous ancestors. Christ also came,"
Romans,15,9,"so that the Gentiles would praise God for being kind to them. It is just as the Scriptures say, “I will tell the nations about you, and I will sing praises to your name.”"
Romans,15,10,"The Scriptures also say to the Gentiles, “Come and celebrate with God's people.”"
Romans,15,11,"Again the Scriptures say, “Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles. All you nations, come and worship him.”"
Romans,15,12,"Isaiah says, “Someone from David's family will come to power. He will rule the nations, and they will put their hope in him.”"
Romans,15,13,"I pray that God, who gives hope, will bless you with complete happiness and peace because of your faith. And may the power of the Holy Spirit fill you with hope."
Romans,15,14,"My friends, I am sure that you are very good and that you have all the knowledge you need to teach each other."
Romans,15,15,But I have spoken to you plainly and have tried to remind you of some things. God was so kind to me!
Romans,15,16,"He chose me to be a servant of Christ Jesus for the Gentiles and to do the work of a priest in the service of his good news. God did this so that the Holy Spirit could make the Gentiles into a holy offering, pleasing to him."
Romans,15,17,"Because of Christ Jesus, I can take pride in my service for God."
Romans,15,18,"In fact, all I will talk about is how Christ let me speak and work, so that the Gentiles would obey him."
Romans,15,19,"Indeed, I will tell how Christ performed miracles and wonders by the power of the Holy Spirit. I have preached the good news about him all the way from Jerusalem to Illyricum."
Romans,15,20,But I have always tried to preach where people have never heard about Christ. I am like a builder who doesn't build on anyone else's foundation.
Romans,15,21,"It is just as the Scriptures say, “All who haven't been told about him will see him, and those who haven't heard about him will understand.”"
Romans,15,22,My work has always kept me from coming to see you.
Romans,15,23,"Now there is nothing left for me to do in this part of the world, and for years I have wanted to visit you."
Romans,15,24,"So I plan to stop off on my way to Spain. Then after a short, but refreshing, stay with you, I hope you will quickly send me on."
Romans,16,1,"I have good things to say about Phoebe, who is a leader in the church at Cenchreae."
Romans,16,2,"Welcome her in a way that is proper for someone who has faith in the Lord and is one of God's own people. Help her in any way you can. After all, she has proved to be a respected leader for many others, including me."
Romans,16,3,"Give my greetings to Priscilla and Aquila. They have not only served Christ Jesus together with me,"
Romans,16,4,but they have even risked their lives for me. I am grateful for them and so are all the Gentile churches.
Romans,16,5,"Greet the church that meets in their home. Greet my dear friend Epaenetus, who was the first person in Asia to have faith in Christ."
Romans,16,6,"Greet Mary, who has worked so hard for you."
Romans,16,7,"Greet my relatives Andronicus and Junias , who were in jail with me. They are highly respected by the apostles and were followers of Christ before I was."
Romans,16,8,"Greet Ampliatus, my dear friend whose faith is in the Lord."
Romans,16,9,"Greet Urbanus, who serves Christ along with us. Greet my dear friend Stachys."
Romans,16,10,"Greet Apelles, a faithful servant of Christ. Greet Aristobulus and his family."
Romans,16,11,"Greet Herodion, who is a relative of mine. Greet Narcissus and the others in his family, who have faith in the Lord."
Romans,16,12,"Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who work hard for the Lord. Greet my dear friend Persis. She also works hard for the Lord."
Romans,16,13,"Greet Rufus, that special servant of the Lord, and greet his mother, who has been like a mother to me."
Romans,16,14,"Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, and Hermas, as well as our friends who are with them."
Romans,16,15,"Greet Philologus, Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all God's people who are with them."
Romans,16,16,Be sure to give each other a warm greeting. All Christ's churches greet you.
Romans,16,17,"My friends, I beg you to watch out for anyone who causes trouble and divides the church by refusing to do what all of you were taught. Stay away from them!"
Romans,16,18,They want to serve themselves and not Christ the Lord. Their flattery and fancy talk fool people who don't know any better.
Romans,16,19,"I am glad that everyone knows how well you obey the Lord. But still, I want you to understand what is good and not have anything to do with evil."
Romans,16,20,"Then God, who gives peace, will soon crush Satan under your feet. I pray that our Lord Jesus will be kind to you."
Romans,16,21,"Timothy, who works with me, sends his greetings, and so do my relatives, Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater."
Romans,16,22,"I, Tertius, also send my greetings. I am a follower of the Lord, and I wrote this letter."
1 Corinthians,1,1,"From Paul, chosen by God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus, and from Sosthenes, who is also a follower."
1 Corinthians,1,2,"To God's church in Corinth. Christ Jesus chose you to be his very own people, and you worship in his name, as we and all others do who call him Lord."
1 Corinthians,1,3,My prayer is that God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you and will bless you with peace!
1 Corinthians,1,4,"I never stop thanking my God for being kind enough to give you Christ Jesus,"
1 Corinthians,1,5,who helps you speak and understand so well.
1 Corinthians,1,6,Now you are certain that everything we told you about our Lord Christ Jesus is true.
1 Corinthians,1,7,"You are not missing out on any blessings, as you wait for him to return."
1 Corinthians,1,8,"And until the day Christ does return, he will keep you completely innocent."
1 Corinthians,1,9,"God can be trusted, and he chose you to be partners with his Son, our Lord Jesus Christ."
1 Corinthians,1,10,"My dear friends, as a follower of our Lord Jesus Christ, I beg you to get along with each other. Don't take sides. Always try to agree in what you think."
1 Corinthians,1,11,Several people from Chloe's family have already reported to me that you keep arguing with each other.
1 Corinthians,1,12,"They have said that some of you claim to follow me, while others claim to follow Apollos or Peter or Christ."
1 Corinthians,1,13,Has Christ been divided up? Was I nailed to a cross for you? Were you baptized in my name?
1 Corinthians,1,14,I thank God that I didn't baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius.
1 Corinthians,1,15,Not one of you can say that you were baptized in my name.
1 Corinthians,1,16,"I did baptize the family of Stephanas, but I don't remember if I baptized anyone else."
1 Corinthians,1,17,Christ did not send me to baptize. He sent me to tell the good news without using big words that would make the cross of Christ lose its power.
1 Corinthians,1,18,"The message about the cross doesn't make any sense to lost people. But for those of us who are being saved, it is God's power at work."
1 Corinthians,1,19,"As God says in the Scriptures, “I will destroy the wisdom of all who claim to be wise. I will confuse those who think they know so much.”"
1 Corinthians,1,20,What happened to those wise people? What happened to those experts in the Scriptures? What happened to the ones who think they have all the answers? Didn't God show that the wisdom of this world is foolish?
1 Corinthians,1,21,"God was wise and decided not to let the people of this world use their wisdom to learn about him. Instead, God chose to save only those who believe the foolish message we preach."
1 Corinthians,1,22,"Jews ask for miracles, and Greeks want something that sounds wise."
1 Corinthians,1,23,"But we preach that Christ was nailed to a cross. Most Jews have problems with this, and most Gentiles think it is foolish."
1 Corinthians,1,24,Our message is God's power and wisdom for the Jews and the Greeks that he has chosen.
1 Corinthians,1,25,"Even when God is foolish, he is wiser than everyone else, and even when God is weak, he is stronger than everyone else."
1 Corinthians,1,26,"My dear friends, remember what you were when God chose you. The people of this world didn't think that many of you were wise. Only a few of you were in places of power, and not many of you came from important families."
1 Corinthians,1,27,But God chose the foolish things of this world to put the wise to shame. He chose the weak things of this world to put the powerful to shame.
1 Corinthians,1,28,"What the world thinks is worthless, useless, and nothing at all is what God has used to destroy what the world considers important."
1 Corinthians,1,29,God did all this to keep anyone from boasting to him.
1 Corinthians,1,30,"You are God's children. He sent Christ Jesus to save us and to make us wise, acceptable, and holy."
1 Corinthians,1,31,"So if you want to boast, do what the Scriptures say and boast about the Lord."
1 Corinthians,2,1,"Friends, when I came and told you the mystery that God had shared with us, I didn't use big words or try to sound wise."
1 Corinthians,2,2,"In fact, while I was with you, I made up my mind to speak only about Jesus Christ, who had been nailed to a cross."
1 Corinthians,2,3,"At first, I was weak and trembling with fear."
1 Corinthians,2,4,"When I talked with you or preached, I didn't try to prove anything by sounding wise. I simply let God's Spirit show his power."
1 Corinthians,2,5,That way you would have faith because of God's power and not because of human wisdom.
1 Corinthians,2,6,"We do use wisdom when speaking to people who are mature in their faith. But it isn't the wisdom of this world or of its rulers, who will soon disappear."
1 Corinthians,2,7,We speak of God's hidden and mysterious wisdom that God decided to use for our glory long before the world began.
1 Corinthians,2,8,"The rulers of this world didn't know anything about this wisdom. If they had known about it, they would not have nailed the glorious Lord to a cross."
1 Corinthians,2,9,"But it is just as the Scriptures say, “What God has planned for people who love him is more than eyes have seen or ears have heard. It has never even entered our minds!”"
1 Corinthians,2,10,"God's Spirit has shown you everything. His Spirit finds out everything, even what is deep in the mind of God."
1 Corinthians,2,11,"You are the only one who knows what is in your own mind, and God's Spirit is the only one who knows what is in God's mind."
1 Corinthians,2,12,But God has given us his Spirit. That's why we don't think the same way that the people of this world think. That's also why we can recognize the blessings that God has given us.
1 Corinthians,2,13,"Every word we speak was taught to us by God's Spirit, not by human wisdom. And this same Spirit helps us teach spiritual things to spiritual people."
1 Corinthians,2,14,That's why only someone who has God's Spirit can understand spiritual blessings. Anyone who doesn't have God's Spirit thinks these blessings are foolish.
1 Corinthians,2,15,"People who are guided by the Spirit can make all kinds of judgments, but they cannot be judged by others."
1 Corinthians,2,16,"The Scriptures ask, “Has anyone ever known the thoughts of the Lord or given him advice?” But we understand what Christ is thinking."
1 Corinthians,3,1,"My friends, you are acting like the people of this world. That's why I could not speak to you as spiritual people. You are like babies as far as your faith in Christ is concerned."
1 Corinthians,3,2,"So I had to treat you like babies and feed you milk. You could not take solid food, and you still cannot,"
1 Corinthians,3,3,because you are not yet spiritual. You are jealous and argue with each other. This proves that you are not spiritual and that you are acting like the people of this world.
1 Corinthians,3,4,"Some of you say that you follow me, and others claim to follow Apollos. Isn't that how ordinary people behave?"
1 Corinthians,3,5,Apollos and I are merely servants who helped you to have faith. It was the Lord who made it all happen.
1 Corinthians,3,6,"I planted the seeds, Apollos watered them, but God made them sprout and grow."
1 Corinthians,3,7,"What matters isn't those who planted or watered, but God who made the plants grow."
1 Corinthians,3,8,The one who plants is just as important as the one who waters. And each one will be paid for what they do.
1 Corinthians,3,9,"Apollos and I work together for God, and you are God's garden and God's building."
1 Corinthians,3,10,"God was kind and let me become an expert builder. I laid a foundation on which others have built. But we must each be careful how we build,"
1 Corinthians,3,11,because Christ is the only foundation.
1 Corinthians,4,1,Think of us as servants of Christ who have been given the work of explaining God's mysterious ways.
1 Corinthians,4,2,"And since our first duty is to be faithful to the one we work for,"
1 Corinthians,4,3,"it doesn't matter to me if I am judged by you or even by a court of law. In fact, I don't judge myself."
1 Corinthians,4,4,"I don't know of anything against me, but that doesn't prove that I am right. The Lord is my judge."
1 Corinthians,4,5,So don't judge anyone until the Lord returns. He will show what is hidden in the dark and what is in everyone's heart. Then God will be the one who praises each of us.
1 Corinthians,4,6,"Friends, I have used Apollos and myself as examples to teach you the meaning of the saying, “Follow the rules.” I want you to stop saying that one of us is better than the other."
1 Corinthians,4,7,"What is so special about you? What do you have that you were not given? And if it was given to you, how can you boast?"
1 Corinthians,4,8,Are you already satisfied? Are you now rich? Have you become kings while we are still nobodies? I wish you were kings. Then we could have a share in your kingdom.
1 Corinthians,4,9,It seems to me that God has put us apostles in the worst possible place. We are like prisoners on their way to death. Angels and the people of this world just laugh at us.
1 Corinthians,4,10,"Because of Christ we are thought of as fools, but Christ has made you wise. We are weak and hated, but you are powerful and respected."
1 Corinthians,4,11,Even today we go hungry and thirsty and don't have anything to wear except rags. We are ill-treated and don't have a place to live.
1 Corinthians,4,12,"We work hard with our own hands, and when people abuse us, we wish them well. When we suffer, we are patient."
1 Corinthians,4,13,"When someone curses us, we answer with kind words. Until now we are thought of as nothing more than the trash and rubbish of this world."
1 Corinthians,4,14,"I am not writing to embarrass you. I want to help you, just as parents help their own dear children."
1 Corinthians,4,15,"Ten thousand people may teach you about Christ, but I am your only father. You became my children when I told you about Christ Jesus,"
1 Corinthians,4,16,and I want you to be like me.
1 Corinthians,4,17,"That's why I sent Timothy to you. I love him like a son, and he is a faithful servant of the Lord. Timothy will tell you what I do to follow Christ and how it agrees with what I always teach about Christ in every church."
1 Corinthians,4,18,"Some of you think I am not coming for a visit, and so you are boasting."
1 Corinthians,4,19,"But if the Lord lets me come, I will soon be there. Then I will find out if the ones who are doing all this boasting really have any power."
1 Corinthians,4,20,God's kingdom isn't just a lot of words. It is power.
1 Corinthians,4,21,What do you want me to do when I arrive? Do you want me to be hard on you or to be kind and gentle?
1 Corinthians,5,1,"I have heard terrible things about some of you. In fact, you are behaving worse than the Gentiles. A man is even sleeping with his own stepmother."
1 Corinthians,5,2,"You are proud, when you ought to feel bad enough to chase away anyone who acts like that."
1 Corinthians,6,1,"When one of you has a complaint against another, do you take your complaint to a court of sinners? Or do you take it to God's people?"
1 Corinthians,6,2,"Don't you know that God's people will judge the world? And if you are going to judge the world, can't you settle small problems?"
1 Corinthians,6,3,"Don't you know that we will judge angels? And if that is so, we can surely judge everyday matters."
1 Corinthians,6,4,Why do you take everyday complaints to judges who are not respected by the church?
1 Corinthians,6,5,I say this to your shame. Aren't any of you wise enough to act as a judge between one follower and another?
1 Corinthians,6,6,Why should one of you take another to be tried by unbelievers?
1 Corinthians,6,7,"When one of you takes another to court, all of you lose. It would be better to let yourselves be cheated and robbed."
1 Corinthians,6,8,"But instead, you cheat and rob other followers."
1 Corinthians,6,9,Don't you know that evil people won't have a share in the blessings of God's kingdom? Don't fool yourselves! No one who is immoral or worships idols or is unfaithful in marriage or is a pervert or behaves like a homosexual
1 Corinthians,6,10,will share in God's kingdom. Neither will any thief or greedy person or drunkard or anyone who curses and cheats others.
1 Corinthians,6,11,Some of you used to be like that. But now the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and the power of God's Spirit have washed you and made you holy and acceptable to God.
1 Corinthians,6,12,"Some of you say, “We can do anything we want to.” But I tell you that not everything is good for us. So I refuse to let anything have power over me."
1 Corinthians,6,13,"You also say, “Food is meant for our bodies, and our bodies are meant for food.” But I tell you that God will destroy them both. We are not supposed to do indecent things with our bodies. We are to use them for the Lord who is in charge of our bodies."
1 Corinthians,6,14,God will raise us from death by the same power that he used when he raised our Lord to life.
1 Corinthians,6,15,"Don't you know that your bodies are part of the body of Christ? Is it right for me to join part of the body of Christ to a prostitute? No, it isn't!"
1 Corinthians,6,16,"Don't you know that a man who does that becomes part of her body? The Scriptures say, “The two of them will be like one person.”"
1 Corinthians,6,17,But anyone who is joined to the Lord is one in spirit with him.
1 Corinthians,6,18,Don't be immoral in matters of sex. That is a sin against your own body in a way that no other sin is.
1 Corinthians,6,19,You know that your body is a temple where the Holy Spirit lives. The Spirit is in you and is a gift from God. You are no longer your own.
1 Corinthians,6,20,God paid a great price for you. So use your body to honour God.
1 Corinthians,7,1,"Now I will answer the questions that you asked in your letter. You asked, “Is it best for people not to marry?”"
1 Corinthians,7,2,"Well, having your own husband or wife should keep you from doing something immoral."
1 Corinthians,7,3,Husbands and wives should be fair with each other about having sex.
1 Corinthians,7,4,"A wife belongs to her husband instead of to herself, and a husband belongs to his wife instead of to himself."
1 Corinthians,7,5,"So don't refuse sex to each other, unless you agree not to have sex for a little while, in order to spend time in prayer. Then Satan won't be able to tempt you because of your lack of self-control."
1 Corinthians,7,6,"In my opinion that is what should be done, though I don't know of anything the Lord said about this matter."
1 Corinthians,7,7,"I wish that all of you were like me, but God has given different gifts to each of us."
1 Corinthians,7,8,"Here is my advice for people who have never been married and for widows. You should stay single, just as I am."
1 Corinthians,7,9,"But if you don't have enough self-control, then go ahead and get married. After all, it is better to marry than to burn with desire."
1 Corinthians,7,10,"I instruct married couples to stay together, and this is exactly what the Lord himself taught. A wife who leaves her husband"
1 Corinthians,7,11,should either stay single or go back to her husband. And a husband should not leave his wife.
1 Corinthians,7,12,"I don't know of anything else the Lord said about marriage. All I can do is to give you my own advice. If your wife isn't a follower of the Lord, but is willing to stay with you, don't divorce her."
1 Corinthians,7,13,"If your husband isn't a follower, but is willing to stay with you, don't divorce him."
1 Corinthians,7,14,Your husband or wife who isn't a follower is made holy by having you as a partner. This also makes your children holy and keeps them from being unclean in God's sight.
1 Corinthians,7,15,"If your husband or wife isn't a follower of the Lord and decides to divorce you, then you should agree to it. You are no longer bound to that person. After all, God chose you and wants you to live at peace."
1 Corinthians,7,16,"And besides, how do you know if you will be able to save your husband or wife who isn't a follower?"
1 Corinthians,7,17,In every church I tell the people to stay as they were when the Lord Jesus chose them and God called them to be his own. Now I say the same thing to you.
1 Corinthians,7,18,"If you are already circumcised, don't try to change it. If you are not circumcised, don't get circumcised."
1 Corinthians,7,19,Being circumcised or uncircumcised isn't really what matters. The important thing is to obey God's commands.
1 Corinthians,7,20,So don't try to change what you were when God chose you.
1 Corinthians,7,21,"Are you a slave? Don't let that bother you. But if you can win your freedom, you should."
1 Corinthians,7,22,"When the Lord chooses slaves, they become his free people. And when he chooses free people, they become slaves of Christ."
1 Corinthians,7,23,God paid a great price for you. So don't become slaves of anyone else.
1 Corinthians,7,24,Stay what you were when God chose you.
1 Corinthians,7,25,"I don't know of anything that the Lord said about people who have never been married. But I will tell you what I think. And you can trust me, because the Lord has treated me with kindness."
1 Corinthians,7,26,"We are now going through hard times, and I think it is best for you to stay as you are."
1 Corinthians,7,27,"If you are married, stay married. If you are not married, don't try to get married."
1 Corinthians,7,28,"It isn't wrong to marry, even if you have never been married before. But those who marry will have a lot of trouble, and I want to protect you from that."
1 Corinthians,7,29,"My friends, what I mean is that the Lord will soon come, and it won't matter if you are married or not."
1 Corinthians,7,30,"It will be all the same if you are crying or laughing, or if you are buying or are completely broke."
1 Corinthians,7,31,It won't make any difference how much good you are getting from this world or how much you like it. This world as we know it is now passing away.
1 Corinthians,7,32,I want all of you to be free from worry. An unmarried man worries about how to please the Lord.
1 Corinthians,7,33,"But a married man has more worries. He must worry about the things of this world, because he wants to please his wife."
1 Corinthians,7,34,"So he is pulled in two directions. Unmarried women and women who have never been married worry only about pleasing the Lord, and they keep their bodies and minds pure. But a married woman worries about the things of this world, because she wants to please her husband."
1 Corinthians,7,35,What I am saying is for your own good—it isn't to limit your freedom. I want to help you to live right and to love the Lord above all else.
1 Corinthians,7,36,"But suppose you are engaged to someone old enough to be married, and you want her so much that all you can think about is getting married. Then go ahead and marry. There is nothing wrong with that."
1 Corinthians,7,37,But it is better to have self-control and to make up your mind not to marry.
1 Corinthians,7,38,"It is perfectly all right to marry, but it is better not to get married at all."
1 Corinthians,7,39,"A wife should stay married to her husband until he dies. Then she is free to marry again, but only to a man who is a follower of the Lord."
1 Corinthians,7,40,"However, I think I am obeying God's Spirit when I say she would be happier to stay single."
1 Corinthians,8,1,"In your letter you asked me about food offered to idols. All of us know something about this subject. But knowledge makes us proud of ourselves, while love makes us helpful to others."
1 Corinthians,8,2,"In fact, people who think they know so much don't know anything at all."
1 Corinthians,8,3,But God has no doubts about who loves him.
1 Corinthians,8,4,"Even though food is offered to idols, we know that none of the idols in this world are alive. After all, there is only one God."
1 Corinthians,8,5,"Many things in heaven and on earth are called gods and lords, but none of them really are gods or lords."
1 Corinthians,8,6,"We have only one God, and he is the Father. He created everything, and we live for him. Jesus Christ is our only Lord. Everything was made by him, and by him life was given to us."
1 Corinthians,8,7,"Not everyone knows these things. In fact, many people have grown up with the belief that idols have life in them. So when they eat meat offered to idols, they are bothered by a weak conscience."
1 Corinthians,8,8,"But food doesn't bring us any closer to God. We are no worse off if we don't eat, and we are no better off if we do."
1 Corinthians,8,9,"Don't cause problems for someone with a weak conscience, just because you have the right to eat anything."
1 Corinthians,8,10,"You know-all this, and so it doesn't bother you to eat in the temple of an idol. But suppose a person with a weak conscience sees you and decides to eat food that has been offered to idols."
1 Corinthians,8,11,Then what you know has destroyed someone Christ died for.
1 Corinthians,8,12,"When you sin by hurting a follower with a weak conscience, you sin against Christ."
1 Corinthians,8,13,"So if I hurt one of the Lord's followers by what I eat, I will never eat meat as long as I live."
1 Corinthians,9,1,I am free. I am an apostle. I have seen the Lord Jesus and have led you to have faith in him.
1 Corinthians,9,2,"Others may think that I am not an apostle, but you are proof that I am an apostle to you."
1 Corinthians,9,3,"When people question me, I tell them"
1 Corinthians,9,4,that Barnabas and I have the right to our food and drink.
1 Corinthians,9,5,"We each have the right to marry one of the Lord's followers and to take her along with us, just as the other apostles and the Lord's brothers and Peter do."
1 Corinthians,9,6,Are we the only ones who have to support ourselves by working at another job?
1 Corinthians,9,7,Do soldiers pay their own salaries? Don't people who raise grapes eat some of what they grow? Don't shepherds get milk from their own goats?
1 Corinthians,10,1,"Friends, I want to remind you that all our ancestors walked under the cloud and went through the sea."
1 Corinthians,10,2,This was like being baptized and becoming followers of Moses.
1 Corinthians,10,3,All of them also ate the same spiritual food
1 Corinthians,10,4,"and drank the same spiritual drink, which flowed from the spiritual rock that followed them. That rock was Christ."
1 Corinthians,10,5,"But most of them did not please God. So they died, and their bodies were scattered all over the desert."
1 Corinthians,10,6,What happened to them is a warning to keep us from wanting to do the same evil things.
1 Corinthians,10,7,"They worshipped idols, just as the Scriptures say, “The people sat down to eat and drink. Then they got up to dance around.” So don't worship idols."
1 Corinthians,10,8,"Some of those people did shameful things, and in a single day about twenty-three thousand of them died. Don't do shameful things as they did."
1 Corinthians,10,9,"And don't try to test Christ, as some of them did and were later bitten by poisonous snakes."
1 Corinthians,10,10,"Don't even grumble, as some of them did and were killed by the destroying angel."
1 Corinthians,10,11,These things happened to them as a warning to us. All this was written in the Scriptures to teach us who live in these last days.
1 Corinthians,10,12,"Even if you think you can stand up to temptation, be careful not to fall."
1 Corinthians,10,13,"You are tempted in the same way that everyone else is tempted. But God can be trusted not to let you be tempted too much, and he will show you how to escape from your temptations."
1 Corinthians,10,14,"My friends, you must keep away from idols."
1 Corinthians,10,15,I am speaking to you as people who have enough sense to know what I am talking about.
1 Corinthians,10,16,"When we drink from the cup that we ask God to bless, isn't that sharing in the blood of Christ? When we eat the bread that we break, isn't that sharing in the body of Christ?"
1 Corinthians,10,17,"By sharing in the same loaf of bread, we become one body, even though there are many of us."
1 Corinthians,10,18,Aren't the people of Israel sharing in the worship when they gather around the altar and eat the sacrifices offered there?
1 Corinthians,10,19,Am I saying that either the idols or the food sacrificed to them is anything at all?
1 Corinthians,10,20,"No, I am not! That food is really sacrificed to demons and not to God. I don't want you to have anything to do with demons."
1 Corinthians,10,21,You cannot drink from the cup of demons and still drink from the Lord's cup. You cannot eat at the table of demons and still eat at the Lord's table.
1 Corinthians,10,22,We would make the Lord jealous if we did that. And we are not stronger than the Lord.
1 Corinthians,10,23,"Some of you say, “We can do whatever we want to!” But I tell you that not everything may be good or helpful."
1 Corinthians,10,24,We should think about others and not about ourselves.
1 Corinthians,10,25,"However, when you buy meat in the market, go ahead and eat it. Keep your conscience clear by not asking where the meat came from."
1 Corinthians,10,26,"The Scriptures say, “The earth and everything in it belong to the Lord.”"
1 Corinthians,10,27,"If an unbeliever invites you to dinner, and you want to go, then go. Eat whatever you are served. Don't cause a problem for someone's conscience by asking where the food came from."
1 Corinthians,11,1,"You must follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ."
1 Corinthians,11,2,"I am proud of you, because you always remember me and obey the teachings I gave you."
1 Corinthians,11,3,"Now I want you to know that Christ is the head over all men, and a man is the head over a woman. But God is the head over Christ."
1 Corinthians,11,4,This means that any man who prays or prophesies with something on his head brings shame to his head.
1 Corinthians,11,5,"But any woman who prays or prophesies without something on her head brings shame to her head. In fact, she may as well shave her head."
1 Corinthians,11,6,"A woman should wear something on her head. It is a disgrace for a woman to shave her head or cut her hair. But if she refuses to wear something on her head, let her cut off her hair."
1 Corinthians,11,7,Men were created to be like God and to bring honour to God. This means that a man should not wear anything on his head. Women were created to bring honour to men.
1 Corinthians,11,8,"It was the woman who was made from a man, and not the man who was made from a woman."
1 Corinthians,11,9,He wasn't created for her. She was created for him.
1 Corinthians,11,10,"And so, because of this, and also because of the angels, a woman ought to wear something on her head, as a sign of her authority."
1 Corinthians,11,11,"As far as the Lord is concerned, men and women need each other."
1 Corinthians,11,12,"It is true that the first woman came from a man, but all other men have been given birth by women. Yet God is the one who created everything."
1 Corinthians,11,13,Ask yourselves if it is proper for a woman to pray without something on her head.
1 Corinthians,11,14,Isn't it unnatural and disgraceful for men to have long hair?
1 Corinthians,11,15,But long hair is a beautiful way for a woman to cover her head.
1 Corinthians,11,16,"This is how things are done in all God's churches, and that's why none of you should argue about what I have said."
1 Corinthians,11,17,Your worship services do you more harm than good. I am certainly not going to praise you for this.
1 Corinthians,11,18,"I am told that you can't get along with each other when you worship, and I am sure that some of what I have heard is true."
1 Corinthians,11,19,"You are bound to argue with each other, but it is easy to see which of you have God's approval."
1 Corinthians,11,20,"When you meet together, you don't really celebrate the Lord's Supper."
1 Corinthians,11,21,"You even start eating before everyone gets to the meeting, and some of you go hungry, while others get drunk."
1 Corinthians,11,22,Don't you have homes where you can eat and drink? Do you hate God's church? Do you want to embarrass people who don't have anything? What can I say to you? I certainly cannot praise you.
1 Corinthians,11,23,I have already told you what the Lord Jesus did on the night he was betrayed. And it came from the Lord himself. He took some bread in his hands.
1 Corinthians,11,24,"Then after he had given thanks, he broke it and said, “This is my body, which is given for you. Eat this and remember me.”"
1 Corinthians,11,25,"After the meal, Jesus took a cup of wine in his hands and said, “This is my blood, and with it God makes his new agreement with you. Drink this and remember me.”"
1 Corinthians,11,26,"The Lord meant that when you eat this bread and drink from this cup, you tell about his death until he comes."
1 Corinthians,11,27,"But if you eat the bread and drink the wine in a way that isn't worthy of the Lord, you sin against his body and blood."
1 Corinthians,11,28,That's why you must examine the way you eat and drink.
1 Corinthians,11,29,"If you fail to understand that you are the body of the Lord, you will condemn yourselves by the way you eat and drink."
1 Corinthians,11,30,That's why many of you are sick and weak and why a lot of others have died.
1 Corinthians,11,31,"If we carefully judge ourselves, we won't be punished."
1 Corinthians,11,32,"But when the Lord judges and punishes us, he does it to keep us from being condemned with the rest of the world."
1 Corinthians,11,33,"My dear friends, you should wait until everyone gets there before you start eating."
1 Corinthians,11,34,"If you really are hungry, you can eat at home. Then you won't condemn yourselves when you meet together. After I arrive, I will instruct you about the other matters."
1 Corinthians,12,1,"My friends, you asked me about spiritual gifts."
1 Corinthians,12,2,"I want you to remember that before you became followers of the Lord, you were led in all the wrong ways by idols that cannot even talk."
1 Corinthians,12,3,"Now I want you to know that if you are led by God's Spirit, you will say that Jesus is Lord, and you will never curse Jesus."
1 Corinthians,12,4,"There are different kinds of spiritual gifts, but they all come from the same Spirit."
1 Corinthians,12,5,"There are different ways to serve the same Lord,"
1 Corinthians,12,6,and we can each do different things. Yet the same God works in all of us and helps us in everything we do.
1 Corinthians,12,7,The Spirit has given each of us a special way of serving others.
1 Corinthians,12,8,"Some of us can speak with wisdom, while others can speak with knowledge, but these gifts come from the same Spirit."
1 Corinthians,12,9,To others the Spirit has given great faith or the power to heal the sick
1 Corinthians,12,10,"or the power to perform mighty miracles. Some of us are prophets, and some of us recognize when God's Spirit is present. Others can speak different kinds of languages, and still others can tell what these languages mean."
1 Corinthians,12,11,But it is the Spirit who does all this and decides which gifts to give to each of us.
1 Corinthians,12,12,"The body of Christ has many different parts, just as any other body does."
1 Corinthians,12,13,"Some of us are Jews, and others are Gentiles. Some of us are slaves, and others are free. But God's Spirit baptized each of us and made us part of the body of Christ. Now we each drink from that same Spirit."
1 Corinthians,12,14,Our bodies don't have just one part. They have many parts.
1 Corinthians,12,15,"Suppose a foot says, “I'm not a hand, and so I'm not part of the body.” Wouldn't the foot still belong to the body?"
1 Corinthians,12,16,"Or suppose an ear says, “I'm not an eye, and so I'm not part of the body.” Wouldn't the ear still belong to the body?"
1 Corinthians,12,17,"If our bodies were only an eye, we couldn't hear a thing. And if they were only an ear, we couldn't smell a thing."
1 Corinthians,12,18,But God has put all parts of our body together in the way that he decided is best.
1 Corinthians,12,19,"A body isn't really a body, unless there is more than one part."
1 Corinthians,12,20,It takes many parts to make a single body.
1 Corinthians,12,21,That's why the eyes cannot say they don't need the hands. That's also why the head cannot say it doesn't need the feet.
1 Corinthians,12,22,"In fact, we cannot get along without the parts of the body that seem to be the weakest."
1 Corinthians,12,23,"We take special care to dress up some parts of our bodies. We are modest about our personal parts,"
1 Corinthians,12,24,but we don't have to be modest about other parts. God put our bodies together in such a way that even the parts that seem the least important are valuable.
1 Corinthians,12,25,"He did this to make all parts of the body work together smoothly, with each part caring about the others."
1 Corinthians,12,26,"If one part of our body hurts, we hurt all over. If one part of our body is honoured, the whole body will be happy."
1 Corinthians,12,27,Together you are the body of Christ. Each one of you is part of his body.
1 Corinthians,12,28,"First, God chose some people to be apostles and prophets and teachers for the church. But he also chose some to perform miracles or heal the sick or help others or be leaders or speak different kinds of languages."
1 Corinthians,12,29,Not everyone is an apostle. Not everyone is a prophet. Not everyone is a teacher. Not everyone can perform miracles.
1 Corinthians,12,30,Not everyone can heal the sick. Not everyone can speak different kinds of languages. Not everyone can tell what these languages mean.
1 Corinthians,12,31,I want you to desire the best gifts. So I will show you a much better way.
1 Corinthians,13,1,"What if I could speak all languages of humans and of angels? If I did not love others, I would be nothing more than a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal."
1 Corinthians,13,2,"What if I could prophesy and understand all secrets and all knowledge? And what if I had faith that moved mountains? I would be nothing, unless I loved others."
1 Corinthians,13,3,"What if I gave away all that I owned and let myself be burnt alive? I would gain nothing, unless I loved others."
1 Corinthians,13,4,"Love is kind and patient, never jealous, boastful, proud, or"
1 Corinthians,13,5,rude. Love isn't selfish or quick-tempered. It doesn't keep a record of wrongs that others do.
1 Corinthians,13,6,"Love rejoices in the truth, but not in evil."
1 Corinthians,13,7,"Love is always supportive, loyal, hopeful, and trusting."
1 Corinthians,13,8,"Love never fails! Everyone who prophesies will stop, and unknown languages will no longer be spoken. All that we know will be forgotten."
1 Corinthians,13,9,"We don't know everything, and our prophecies are not complete."
1 Corinthians,13,10,"But what is perfect will some day appear, and what isn't perfect will then disappear."
1 Corinthians,13,11,"When we were children, we thought and reasoned as children do. But when we grew up, we stopped our childish ways."
1 Corinthians,13,12,"Now all we can see of God is like a cloudy picture in a mirror. Later we will see him face to face. We don't know everything, but then we will, just as God completely understands us."
1 Corinthians,13,13,"For now there are faith, hope, and love. But of these three, the greatest is love."
1 Corinthians,14,1,"Love should be your guide. Be eager to have the gifts that come from the Holy Spirit, especially the gift of prophecy."
1 Corinthians,14,2,"If you speak languages that others don't know, God will understand what you are saying, though no one else will know what you mean. You will be talking about mysteries that only the Spirit understands."
1 Corinthians,14,3,"But when you prophesy, you will be understood, and others will be helped. They will be encouraged and made to feel better."
1 Corinthians,14,4,"By speaking languages that others don't know, you help only yourself. But by prophesying you help everyone in the church."
1 Corinthians,14,5,"I am glad for you to speak unknown languages, although I would rather you prophesied. In fact, prophesying does much more good than speaking unknown languages, unless someone can help the church by explaining what you mean."
1 Corinthians,14,6,"My friends, what good would it do, if I came and spoke unknown languages to you and didn't explain what I meant? How would I help you, unless I told you what God had shown me or gave you some knowledge or prophecy or teaching?"
1 Corinthians,14,7,"If all musical instruments sounded alike, how would you know the difference between a flute and a harp?"
1 Corinthians,14,8,"If a bugle call isn't clear, how would you know to get ready for battle?"
1 Corinthians,14,9,"That's how it is when you speak unknown languages. If no one can understand what you are talking about, you will only be talking to the wind."
1 Corinthians,14,10,"There are many different languages in this world, and all of them make sense."
1 Corinthians,14,11,"But if I don't understand the language that someone is using, we will be like foreigners to each other."
1 Corinthians,14,12,"If you really want spiritual gifts, choose the ones that will be most helpful to the church."
1 Corinthians,14,13,"When we speak languages that others don't know, we should pray for the power to explain what we mean."
1 Corinthians,14,14,"For example, if I use an unknown language in my prayers, my spirit prays but my mind is useless."
1 Corinthians,14,15,"Then what should I do? There are times when I should pray with my spirit, and times when I should pray with my mind. Sometimes I should sing with my spirit, and at other times I should sing with my mind."
1 Corinthians,14,16,"Suppose some strangers are in your worship service, when you are praising God with your spirit. If they don't understand you, how will they know to say, “Amen”?"
1 Corinthians,14,17,"You may be worshipping God in a wonderful way, but no one else will be helped."
1 Corinthians,14,18,I thank God that I speak unknown languages more than any of you.
1 Corinthians,14,19,But words that make sense can help the church. That's why in church I had rather speak five words that make sense than to speak ten thousand words in a language that others don't know.
1 Corinthians,14,20,"My friends, stop thinking like children. Think like mature people and be as innocent as tiny babies."
1 Corinthians,14,21,"In the Scriptures the Lord says, “I will use strangers who speak unknown languages to talk to my people. They will speak to them in foreign languages, but still my people won't listen to me.”"
1 Corinthians,14,22,"Languages that others don't know may mean something to unbelievers, but not to the Lord's followers. Prophecy, on the other hand, is for followers, not for unbelievers."
1 Corinthians,14,23,"Suppose everyone in your worship service started speaking unknown languages, and some outsiders or some unbelievers come in. Won't they think you are mad?"
1 Corinthians,14,24,"But suppose all of you are prophesying when those unbelievers and outsiders come in. They will realize that they are sinners, and they will want to change their ways because of what you are saying."
1 Corinthians,14,25,"They will tell what is hidden in their hearts. Then they will kneel down and say to God, “We are certain that you are with these people.”"
1 Corinthians,14,26,"My friends, when you meet to worship, you must do everything for the good of everyone there. That's how it should be when someone sings or teaches or tells what God has said or speaks an unknown language or explains what the language means."
1 Corinthians,14,27,"No more than two or three of you should speak unknown languages during the meeting. You must take turns, and someone should always be there to explain what you mean."
1 Corinthians,14,28,"If no one can explain, you must keep silent in church and speak only to yourself and to God."
1 Corinthians,14,29,"Two or three persons may prophesy, and everyone else must listen carefully."
1 Corinthians,14,30,"If someone sitting there receives a message from God, the speaker must stop and let the other person speak."
1 Corinthians,14,31,"Let only one person speak at a time, then all of you will learn something and be encouraged."
1 Corinthians,14,32,A prophet should be willing to stop and let someone else speak.
1 Corinthians,14,33,"God wants everything to be done peacefully and in order. When God's people meet in church,"
1 Corinthians,14,34,"the women must not be allowed to speak. They must keep quiet and listen, as the Law of Moses teaches."
1 Corinthians,14,35,"If there is something they want to know, they can ask their husbands when they get home. It is disgraceful for women to speak in church."
1 Corinthians,14,36,"God's message did not start with you people, and you are not the only ones it has reached."
1 Corinthians,14,37,"If you think of yourself as a prophet or a spiritual person, you will know that I am writing only what the Lord has commanded."
1 Corinthians,14,38,So don't pay attention to anyone who ignores what I am writing.
1 Corinthians,14,39,"My friends, be eager to prophesy and don't stop anyone from speaking languages that others don't know."
1 Corinthians,14,40,But do everything properly and in order.
1 Corinthians,15,1,"My friends, I want you to remember the message that I preached and that you believed and trusted."
1 Corinthians,15,2,"You will be saved by this message, if you hold firmly to it. But if you don't, your faith was all for nothing."
1 Corinthians,15,3,"I told you the most important part of the message exactly as it was told to me. That part is: Christ died for our sins, as the Scriptures say."
1 Corinthians,15,4,"He was buried, and three days later he was raised to life, as the Scriptures say."
1 Corinthians,15,5,"Christ appeared to Peter, then to the twelve."
1 Corinthians,15,6,"After this, he appeared to more than five hundred other followers. Most of them are still alive, but some have died."
1 Corinthians,15,7,"He also appeared to James, and then to all the apostles."
1 Corinthians,15,8,"Finally, he appeared to me, even though I am like someone who was born at the wrong time."
1 Corinthians,15,9,"I am the least important of all the apostles. In fact, I caused so much trouble for God's church that I don't even deserve to be called an apostle."
1 Corinthians,15,10,"But God was kind! He made me what I am, and his wonderful kindness wasn't wasted. I worked much harder than any of the other apostles, although it was really God's kindness at work and not me."
1 Corinthians,15,11,But it doesn't matter if I preached or if they preached. All of you believed the message just the same.
1 Corinthians,15,12,"If we preach that Christ was raised from death, how can some of you say that the dead will not be raised to life?"
1 Corinthians,15,13,"If they won't be raised to life, Christ himself wasn't raised to life."
1 Corinthians,15,14,"And if Christ wasn't raised to life, our message is worthless, and so is your faith."
1 Corinthians,15,15,"If the dead won't be raised to life, we have told lies about God by saying that he raised Christ to life, when he really did not."
1 Corinthians,15,16,"So if the dead won't be raised to life, Christ wasn't raised to life."
1 Corinthians,15,17,"Unless Christ was raised to life, your faith is useless, and you are still living in your sins."
1 Corinthians,15,18,And those people who died after putting their faith in him are completely lost.
1 Corinthians,15,19,"If our hope in Christ is good only for this life, we are worse off than anyone else."
1 Corinthians,15,20,But Christ has been raised to life! And he makes us certain that others will also be raised to life.
1 Corinthians,15,21,"Just as we will die because of Adam, we will be raised to life because of Christ."
1 Corinthians,15,22,"Adam brought death to all of us, and Christ will bring life to all of us."
1 Corinthians,15,23,"But we must each wait our turn. Christ was the first to be raised to life, and his people will be raised to life when he returns."
1 Corinthians,15,24,"Then after Christ has destroyed all powers and forces, the end will come, and he will give the kingdom to God the Father."
1 Corinthians,15,25,"Christ will rule until he puts all his enemies under his power,"
1 Corinthians,15,26,and the last enemy he destroys will be death.
1 Corinthians,15,27,"When the Scriptures say that he will put everything under his power, they don't include God. It was God who put everything under the power of Christ."
1 Corinthians,15,28,"After everything is under the power of God's Son, he will put himself under the power of God, who put everything under his Son's power. Then God will mean everything to everyone."
1 Corinthians,15,29,"If the dead are not going to be raised to life, what will people do who are being baptized for them? Why are they being baptized for those dead people?"
1 Corinthians,15,30,And why do we always risk our lives
1 Corinthians,15,31,and face death every day? The pride that I have in you because of Christ Jesus our Lord is what makes me say this.
1 Corinthians,15,32,"What do you think I gained by fighting wild animals in Ephesus? If the dead are not raised to life, “Let's eat and drink. Tomorrow we die.”"
1 Corinthians,15,33,Don't fool yourselves. Bad friends will destroy you.
1 Corinthians,15,34,Be sensible and stop sinning. You should be embarrassed that some people still don't know about God.
1 Corinthians,15,35,"Some of you have asked, “How will the dead be raised to life? What kind of bodies will they have?”"
1 Corinthians,15,36,Don't be foolish. A seed must die before it can sprout from the ground.
1 Corinthians,15,37,Wheat seeds and all other seeds look different from the sprouts that come up.
1 Corinthians,15,38,This is because God gives everything the kind of body he wants it to have.
1 Corinthians,15,39,"People, animals, birds, and fish are each made of flesh, but none of them are alike."
1 Corinthians,15,40,"Everything in the heavens has a body, and so does everything on earth. But each one is very different from all the others."
1 Corinthians,15,41,"The sun isn't like the moon, the moon isn't like the stars, and each star is different."
1 Corinthians,15,42,"That's how it will be when our bodies are raised to life. These bodies will die, but the bodies that are raised will live for ever."
1 Corinthians,15,43,These ugly and weak bodies will become beautiful and strong.
1 Corinthians,15,44,"As there are physical bodies, there are spiritual bodies. And our physical bodies will be changed into spiritual bodies."
1 Corinthians,15,45,"The first man was named Adam, and the Scriptures tell us that he was a living person. But Jesus, who may be called the last Adam, is a life-giving spirit."
1 Corinthians,15,46,We see that the one with a spiritual body did not come first. He came after the one who had a physical body.
1 Corinthians,15,47,"The first man was made from the dust of the earth, but the second man came from heaven."
1 Corinthians,15,48,Everyone on earth has a body like the body of the one who was made from the dust of the earth. And everyone in heaven has a body like the body of the one who came from heaven.
1 Corinthians,15,49,"Just as we are like the one who was made out of earth, we will be like the one who came from heaven."
1 Corinthians,15,50,"My friends, I want you to know that our bodies of flesh and blood will decay. This means that they cannot share in God's kingdom, which lasts for ever."
1 Corinthians,15,51,"I will explain a mystery to you. Not every one of us will die, but we will all be changed."
1 Corinthians,15,52,"It will happen suddenly, quicker than the blink of an eye. At the sound of the last trumpet the dead will be raised. We will all be changed, so that we will never die again."
1 Corinthians,15,53,Our dead and decaying bodies will be changed into bodies that won't die or decay.
1 Corinthians,15,54,"The bodies we now have are weak and can die. But they will be changed into bodies that are eternal. Then the Scriptures will come true, “Death has lost the battle!"
1 Corinthians,15,55,Where is its victory? Where is its sting?”
1 Corinthians,15,56,"Sin is what gives death its sting, and the Law is the power behind sin."
1 Corinthians,15,57,But thank God for letting our Lord Jesus Christ give us the victory!
1 Corinthians,15,58,"My dear friends, stand firm and don't be shaken. Always keep busy working for the Lord. You know that everything you do for him is worthwhile."
1 Corinthians,16,1,"When you collect money for God's people, I want you to do exactly what I told the churches in Galatia to do."
1 Corinthians,16,2,"That is, each Sunday each of you must put aside part of what you have earned. If you do this, you won't have to take up a collection when I come."
1 Corinthians,16,3,Choose some followers to take the money to Jerusalem. I will send them on with the money and with letters which show that you approve of them.
1 Corinthians,16,4,"If you think I should go along, they can go with me."
1 Corinthians,16,5,"After I have gone through Macedonia, I hope to see you"
1 Corinthians,16,6,"and stay with you for a while. I may even stay all winter, so that you can help me on my way to wherever I will be going next."
1 Corinthians,16,7,"If the Lord lets me, I would rather come later for a longer visit than to stop off now for only a short visit."
1 Corinthians,16,8,"I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost,"
1 Corinthians,16,9,because there is a wonderful opportunity for me to do some work here. But there are also many people who are against me.
1 Corinthians,16,10,"When Timothy arrives, give him a friendly welcome. He is doing the Lord's work, just as I am."
1 Corinthians,16,11,"Don't let anyone ill-treat him. I am looking for him to return to me together with the other followers. So when he leaves, send him off with your blessings."
1 Corinthians,16,12,"I have tried hard to get our friend Apollos to visit you with the other followers. He doesn't want to come just now, but he will come when he can."
1 Corinthians,16,13,Keep alert. Be firm in your faith. Stay brave and strong.
1 Corinthians,16,14,Show love in everything you do.
1 Corinthians,16,15,"You know that Stephanas and his family were the first in Achaia to have faith in the Lord. They have done all they can for God's people. My friends, I ask you"
1 Corinthians,16,16,to obey leaders like them and to do the same for all others who work hard with you.
1 Corinthians,16,17,I was glad to see Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus. Having them here was like having you.
1 Corinthians,16,18,"They made me feel much better, just as they made you feel better. You should appreciate people like them."
1 Corinthians,16,19,"Greetings from the churches in Asia. Aquila and Priscilla, together with the church that meets in their house, send greetings in the name of the Lord."
1 Corinthians,16,20,All the Lord's followers send their greetings. Give each other a warm greeting.
1 Corinthians,16,21,I am signing this letter myself: PAUL.
1 Corinthians,16,22,I pray that God will put a curse on everyone who doesn't love the Lord. And may the Lord come soon.
1 Corinthians,16,23,I pray that the Lord Jesus will be kind to you.
1 Corinthians,16,24,I love everyone who belongs to Christ Jesus.
2 Corinthians,1,1,"From Paul, chosen by God to be an apostle of Jesus Christ, and from Timothy, who is also a follower. To God's church in Corinth and to all God's people in Achaia."
2 Corinthians,1,2,I pray that God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you and will bless you with peace!
2 Corinthians,1,3,"Praise God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! The Father is a merciful God, who always gives us comfort."
2 Corinthians,1,4,"He comforts us when we are in trouble, so that we can share that same comfort with others in trouble."
2 Corinthians,1,5,"We share in the terrible sufferings of Christ, but also in the wonderful comfort he gives."
2 Corinthians,1,6,"We suffer in the hope that you will be comforted and saved. And because we are comforted, you will also be comforted, as you patiently endure suffering like ours."
2 Corinthians,1,7,"You never disappoint us. You suffered as much as we did, and we know that you will be comforted as we were."
2 Corinthians,1,8,"My friends, I want you to know what a hard time we had in Asia. Our sufferings were so horrible and so unbearable that death seemed certain."
2 Corinthians,1,9,"In fact, we felt sure that we were going to die. But this made us stop trusting in ourselves and start trusting God, who raises the dead to life."
2 Corinthians,1,10,"God saved us from the threat of death, and we are sure that he will do it again and again."
2 Corinthians,1,11,Please help us by praying for us. Then many people will give thanks for the blessings we receive in answer to all these prayers.
2 Corinthians,1,12,"We can be proud of our clear conscience. We have always lived honestly and sincerely, especially when we were with you. And we were guided by God's wonderful kindness instead of by the wisdom of this world."
2 Corinthians,1,13,"I am not writing anything you cannot read and understand. I hope you will understand it completely,"
2 Corinthians,1,14,"just as you already partly understand us. Then when our Lord Jesus returns, you can be as proud of us as we are of you."
2 Corinthians,1,15,I was so sure of your pride in us that I had planned to visit you first of all. In this way you would have the blessing of two visits from me.
2 Corinthians,1,16,Once on my way to Macedonia and again on my return from there. Then you could send me on to Judea.
2 Corinthians,1,17,Do you think I couldn't make up my mind about what to do? Or do I seem like someone who says “Yes” or “No” simply to please others?
2 Corinthians,1,18,"God can be trusted, and so can I, when I say that our answer to you has always been “Yes” and never “No”."
2 Corinthians,1,19,"This is because Jesus Christ the Son of God is always “Yes” and never “No”. And he is the one that Silas, Timothy, and I told you about."
2 Corinthians,1,20,Christ says “Yes” to all of God's promises. That's why we have Christ to say “Amen” for us to the glory of God.
2 Corinthians,1,21,And so God makes it possible for you and us to stand firmly together with Christ. God is also the one who chose us
2 Corinthians,1,22,and put his Spirit in our hearts to show that we belong only to him.
2 Corinthians,1,23,"God is my witness that I stayed away from Corinth, just to keep from being hard on you."
2 Corinthians,1,24,"We are not bosses who tell you what to believe. We are working with you to make you glad, because your faith is strong."
2 Corinthians,2,1,I have decided not to make my next visit to you so painful.
2 Corinthians,2,2,"If I make you feel bad, who would be left to cheer me up, except the people I had made to feel bad?"
2 Corinthians,2,3,"The reason I want to be happy is to make you happy. I wrote as I did because I didn't want to visit you and be made to feel bad, when you should make me feel happy."
2 Corinthians,2,4,"At the time I wrote, I was suffering terribly. My eyes were full of tears, and my heart was broken. But I didn't want to make you feel bad. I only wanted to let you know how much I cared for you."
2 Corinthians,2,5,"I don't want to be hard on you. But if one of you has made someone feel bad, I am not really the one who has been made to feel bad. Some of you are the ones."
2 Corinthians,2,6,"Most of you have already pointed out the wrong that person did, and that is punishment enough for what was done."
2 Corinthians,2,7,"When people sin, you should forgive and comfort them, so they won't give up in despair."
2 Corinthians,2,8,You should make them sure of your love for them.
2 Corinthians,2,9,I also wrote because I wanted to test you and find out if you would follow my instructions.
2 Corinthians,2,10,"I will forgive anyone you forgive. Yes, for your sake and with Christ as my witness, I have forgiven whatever needed to be forgiven."
2 Corinthians,2,11,I have done this to keep Satan from getting the better of us. We all know what goes on in his mind.
2 Corinthians,2,12,"When I went to Troas to preach the good news about Christ, I found that the Lord had already prepared the way."
2 Corinthians,2,13,But I was worried when I didn't find my friend Titus there. So I left the other followers and went on to Macedonia.
2 Corinthians,2,14,"I am grateful that God always makes it possible for Christ to lead us to victory. God also helps us spread the knowledge about Christ everywhere, and this knowledge is like the smell of perfume."
2 Corinthians,3,1,Are we once again boasting about ourselves? Do we need letters to you or from you to tell others about us? Some people do need letters that tell about them.
2 Corinthians,3,2,"But you are our letter, and you are in our hearts for everyone to read and understand."
2 Corinthians,3,3,You are like a letter written by Christ and delivered by us. But you are not written with pen and ink or on tablets made of stone. You are written in our hearts by the Spirit of the living God.
2 Corinthians,3,4,We are sure about all this. Christ makes us sure in the very presence of God.
2 Corinthians,3,5,We don't have the right to claim that we have done anything on our own. God gives us what it takes to do all that we do.
2 Corinthians,3,6,"He makes us worthy to be the servants of his new agreement that comes from the Holy Spirit and not from a written Law. After all, the Law brings death, but the Spirit brings life."
2 Corinthians,3,7,"The Law of Moses brought only the promise of death, even though it was carved on stones and given in a wonderful way. Still the Law made Moses' face shine so brightly that the people of Israel could not look at it, even though it was a fading glory."
2 Corinthians,3,8,So won't the agreement that the Spirit brings to us be even more wonderful?
2 Corinthians,3,9,"If something that brings the death sentence is glorious, won't something that makes us acceptable to God be even more glorious?"
2 Corinthians,3,10,"In fact, the new agreement is so wonderful that the Law is no longer glorious at all."
2 Corinthians,3,11,"The Law was given with a glory that faded away. But the glory of the new agreement is much greater, because it will never fade away."
2 Corinthians,3,12,This wonderful hope makes us feel like speaking freely.
2 Corinthians,3,13,"We are not like Moses. His face was shining, but he covered it to keep the people of Israel from seeing the brightness fade away."
2 Corinthians,3,14,"The people were stubborn, and something still keeps them from seeing the truth when the Law is read. Only Christ can take away the covering that keeps them from seeing."
2 Corinthians,3,15,"When the Law of Moses is read, they have their minds covered over"
2 Corinthians,3,16,with a covering that is removed only for those who turn to the Lord.
2 Corinthians,3,17,"The Lord and the Spirit are one and the same, and the Lord's Spirit sets us free."
2 Corinthians,3,18,"So our faces are not covered. They show the bright glory of the Lord, as the Lord's Spirit makes us more and more like our glorious Lord."
2 Corinthians,4,1,God has been kind enough to trust us with this work. That's why we never give up.
2 Corinthians,4,2,"We don't do shameful things that must be kept secret. And we don't try to fool anyone or twist God's message around. God is our witness that we speak only the truth, so others will be sure that we can be trusted."
2 Corinthians,4,3,"If there is anything hidden about our message, it is hidden only to someone who is lost."
2 Corinthians,4,4,"The god who rules this world has blinded the minds of unbelievers. They cannot see the light, which is the good news about our glorious Christ, who shows what God is like."
2 Corinthians,4,5,We are not preaching about ourselves. Our message is that Jesus Christ is Lord. He also sent us to be your servants.
2 Corinthians,4,6,"The Scriptures say, “God commanded light to shine in the dark.” Now God is shining in our hearts to let you know that his glory is seen in Jesus Christ."
2 Corinthians,4,7,We are like clay jars in which this treasure is stored. The real power comes from God and not from us.
2 Corinthians,4,8,"We often suffer, but we are never crushed. Even when we don't know what to do, we never give up."
2 Corinthians,4,9,"In times of trouble, God is with us, and when we are knocked down, we get up again."
2 Corinthians,5,1,"Our bodies are like tents that we live in here on earth. But when these tents are destroyed, we know that God will give each of us a place to live. These homes will not be buildings that someone has made, but they are in heaven and will last for ever."
2 Corinthians,5,2,"While we are here on earth, we sigh because we want to live in that heavenly home."
2 Corinthians,5,3,We want to put it on like clothes and not be naked.
2 Corinthians,5,4,"These tents we now live in are like a heavy burden, and we groan. But we don't do this just because we want to leave these bodies that will die. It is because we want to change them for bodies that will never die."
2 Corinthians,5,5,God is the one who makes all this possible. He has given us his Spirit to make us certain that he will do it.
2 Corinthians,5,6,"So always be cheerful! As long as we are in these bodies, we are away from the Lord."
2 Corinthians,5,7,"But we live by faith, not by what we see."
2 Corinthians,5,8,"We should be cheerful, because we would rather leave these bodies and be at home with the Lord."
2 Corinthians,5,9,"But whether we are at home with the Lord or away from him, we still try our best to please him."
2 Corinthians,5,10,"After all, Christ will judge each of us for the good or the bad that we do while living in these bodies."
2 Corinthians,5,11,"We know what it means to respect the Lord, and we encourage everyone to turn to him. God himself knows what we are like, and I hope you also know what kind of people we are."
2 Corinthians,5,12,"We are not trying once more to boast about ourselves. But we want you to be proud of us, when you are with those who are not sincere and boast about what others think of them."
2 Corinthians,5,13,"If we seem out of our minds, it is between God and us. But if we are in our right minds, it is for your good."
2 Corinthians,5,14,"We are ruled by Christ's love for us. We are certain that if one person died for everyone else, then all of us have died."
2 Corinthians,5,15,"And Christ did die for all of us. He died so we would no longer live for ourselves, but for the one who died and was raised to life for us."
2 Corinthians,5,16,"We are careful not to judge people by what they seem to be, though we once judged Christ in that way."
2 Corinthians,5,17,"Anyone who belongs to Christ is a new person. The past is forgotten, and everything is new."
2 Corinthians,5,18,"God has done it all! He sent Christ to make peace between himself and us, and he has given us the work of making peace between himself and others."
2 Corinthians,5,19,"What we mean is that God was in Christ, offering peace and forgiveness to the people of this world. And he has given us the work of sharing his message about peace."
2 Corinthians,5,20,"We were sent to speak for Christ, and God is begging you to listen to our message. We speak for Christ and sincerely ask you to make peace with God."
2 Corinthians,5,21,"Christ never sinned! But God treated him as a sinner, so that Christ could make us acceptable to God."
2 Corinthians,6,1,"We work together with God, and we beg you to make good use of God's kindness to you."
2 Corinthians,6,2,"In the Scriptures God says, “When the time came, I listened to you, and when you needed help, I came to save you.” That time has come. This is the day for you to be saved."
2 Corinthians,6,3,"We don't want anyone to find fault with our work, and so we try hard not to cause problems."
2 Corinthians,6,4,"But in everything and in every way we show that we truly are God's servants. We have always been patient, though we have had a lot of trouble, suffering, and hard times."
2 Corinthians,6,5,"We have been beaten, put in jail, and hurt in riots. We have worked hard and have gone without sleep or food."
2 Corinthians,6,6,"But we have kept ourselves pure and have been understanding, patient, and kind. The Holy Spirit has been with us, and our love has been real."
2 Corinthians,6,7,"We have spoken the truth, and God's power has worked in us. In all our struggles we have said and done only what is right."
2 Corinthians,6,8,"Whether we were honoured or dishonoured or praised or cursed, we always told the truth about ourselves. But some people said we did not."
2 Corinthians,6,9,"We are unknown to others, but well known to you. We seem to be dying, and yet we are still alive. We have been punished, but never killed,"
2 Corinthians,6,10,"and we are always happy, even in times of suffering. Although we are poor, we have made many people rich. And though we own nothing, everything is ours."
2 Corinthians,6,11,"Friends in Corinth, we are telling the truth when we say that there is room in our hearts for you."
2 Corinthians,6,12,"We are not holding back on our love for you, but you are holding back on your love for us."
2 Corinthians,6,13,I speak to you as I would speak to my own children. Please make room in your hearts for us.
2 Corinthians,6,14,Stay away from people who are not followers of the Lord! Can someone who is good get along with someone who is evil? Are light and darkness the same?
2 Corinthians,6,15,Is Christ a friend of Satan? Can people who follow the Lord have anything in common with those who don't?
2 Corinthians,6,16,"Do idols belong in the temple of God? We are the temple of the living God, as God himself says, “I will live with these people and walk among them. I will be their God, and they will be my people.”"
2 Corinthians,6,17,"The Lord also says, “Leave them and stay away! Don't touch anything that isn't clean. Then I will welcome you"
2 Corinthians,6,18,"and be your Father. You will be my sons and my daughters, as surely as I am God, the All-Powerful.”"
2 Corinthians,7,1,"My friends, God has made us these promises. So we should stay away from everything that keeps our bodies and spirits from being clean. We should honour God and try to be completely like him."
2 Corinthians,7,2,Make a place for us in your hearts! We haven't ill-treated or hurt anyone. We haven't cheated anyone.
2 Corinthians,7,3,"I am not saying this to be hard on you. But, as I have said before, you will always be in our thoughts, whether we live or die."
2 Corinthians,7,4,"I trust you completely. I am always proud of you, and I am greatly encouraged. In all my trouble I am still very happy."
2 Corinthians,7,5,"After we came to Macedonia, we didn't have any chance to rest. We were faced with all kinds of problems. We were troubled by enemies and troubled by fears."
2 Corinthians,7,6,"But God cheers up people in need, and that is what he did when he sent Titus to us."
2 Corinthians,7,7,"Of course, we were glad to see Titus, but what really made us glad is the way you cheered him up. He told how sorry you were and how concerned you were about me. And this made me even happier."
2 Corinthians,7,8,"I don't feel bad any more, even though my letter hurt your feelings. I did feel bad at first, but I don't now. I know that the letter hurt you for a while."
2 Corinthians,7,9,"Now I am happy, but not because I hurt your feelings. It is because God used your hurt feelings to make you turn back to him, and none of you were harmed by us."
2 Corinthians,7,10,"When God makes you feel sorry enough to turn to him and be saved, you don't have anything to feel bad about. But when this world makes you feel sorry, it can cause your death."
2 Corinthians,7,11,Just look what God has done by making you feel sorry! You sincerely want to prove that you are innocent. You are angry. You are shocked. You are eager to see that justice is done. You have proved that you were completely right in this matter.
2 Corinthians,7,12,"When I wrote to you, it wasn't to accuse the one who was wrong or to stand up for the one who was hurt. I wrote, so that God would show you how much you do care for us."
2 Corinthians,7,13,"And we were greatly encouraged. Although we were encouraged, we felt even better when we saw how happy Titus was, because you had shown that he had nothing to worry about."
2 Corinthians,7,14,"We had told him how much we thought of you, and you did not disappoint us. Just as we have always told you the truth, so everything we told him about you has also proved to be true."
2 Corinthians,7,15,"Titus loves all of you very much, especially when he remembers how you obeyed him and how you trembled with fear when you welcomed him."
2 Corinthians,7,16,It makes me really glad to know that I can depend on you.
2 Corinthians,8,1,"My friends, we want you to know that the churches in Macedonia have shown others how kind God is."
2 Corinthians,8,2,"Although they were going through hard times and were very poor, they were glad to give generously."
2 Corinthians,8,3,"They gave as much as they could afford and even more, simply because they wanted to."
2 Corinthians,8,4,They even asked and begged us to let them have the joy of giving their money for God's people.
2 Corinthians,8,5,"And they did more than we had hoped. They gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us, just as God wanted them to do."
2 Corinthians,8,6,"Titus was the one who got you started doing this good thing, so we begged him to help you finish what you had begun."
2 Corinthians,8,7,"You do everything better than anyone else. You have stronger faith. You speak better and know more. You are eager to give, and you love us better. Now you must give more generously than anyone else."
2 Corinthians,8,8,I am not ordering you to do this. I am simply testing how real your love is by comparing it with the concern that others have shown.
2 Corinthians,8,9,"You know that our Lord Jesus Christ was kind enough to give up all his riches and become poor, so that you could become rich."
2 Corinthians,8,10,"A year ago you were the first ones to give, and you gave because you wanted to. So listen to my advice."
2 Corinthians,8,11,"I think you should finish what you started. If you give according to what you have, you will prove that you are as eager to give as you were to think about giving."
2 Corinthians,8,12,It doesn't matter how much you have. What matters is how much you are willing to give from what you have.
2 Corinthians,8,13,I am not trying to make life easier for others by making life harder for you. But it is only fair
2 Corinthians,8,14,"for you to share with them when you have so much, and they have so little. Later, when they have more than enough, and you are in need, they can share with you. Then everyone will have a fair share,"
2 Corinthians,8,15,"just as the Scriptures say, “Those who gathered too much had nothing left. Those who gathered only a little had all they needed.”"
2 Corinthians,8,16,I am grateful that God made Titus care as much about you as we do.
2 Corinthians,8,17,"When we begged Titus to visit you, he said he would. He wanted to because he cared so much for you."
2 Corinthians,8,18,With Titus we are also sending one of the Lord's followers who is well known in every church for spreading the good news.
2 Corinthians,8,19,The churches chose this follower to travel with us while we carry this gift that will bring praise to the Lord and show how much we hope to help.
2 Corinthians,8,20,We don't want anyone to find fault with the way we handle your generous gift.
2 Corinthians,8,21,But we want to do what pleases the Lord and what people think is right.
2 Corinthians,8,22,"We are also sending someone else with Titus and the other follower. We approve of this man. In fact, he has already shown us many times that he wants to help. And now he wants to help even more than ever, because he trusts you so much."
2 Corinthians,8,23,"Titus is my partner, who works with me to serve you. The other two followers are sent by the churches, and they bring honour to Christ."
2 Corinthians,8,24,Treat them in such a way that the churches will see your love and will know why we boasted about you.
2 Corinthians,9,1,I don't need to write to you about the money you plan to give for God's people.
2 Corinthians,9,2,I know how eager you are to give. And I have proudly told the Lord's followers in Macedonia that you people in Achaia have been ready for a whole year. Now your desire to give has made them want to give.
2 Corinthians,9,3,"That's why I am sending Titus and the two others to you. I want you to be ready, just as I promised. This will prove that we were not wrong to boast about you."
2 Corinthians,9,4,"Some followers from Macedonia may come with me, and I want them to find that you have the money ready. If you don't, I would be embarrassed for trusting you to do this. But you would be embarrassed even more."
2 Corinthians,9,5,"So I have decided to ask Titus and the others to spend some time with you before I arrive. This way they can arrange to collect the money you have promised. Then you will have the chance to give because you want to, and not because you feel forced to."
2 Corinthians,9,6,"Remember this saying, “A few seeds make a small harvest, but a lot of seeds make a big harvest.”"
2 Corinthians,9,7,Each of you must make up your own mind about how much to give. But don't feel sorry that you must give and don't feel that you are forced to give. God loves people who love to give.
2 Corinthians,9,8,"God can bless you with everything you need, and you will always have more than enough to do all kinds of good things for others."
2 Corinthians,9,9,"The Scriptures say, “God freely gives his gifts to the poor, and always does right.”"
2 Corinthians,9,10,"God gives seed to farmers and provides everyone with food. He will increase what you have, so that you can give even more to those in need."
2 Corinthians,9,11,"You will be blessed in every way, and you will be able to keep on being generous. Then many people will thank God when we deliver your gift."
2 Corinthians,9,12,What you are doing is much more than a service that supplies God's people with what they need. It is something that will make many others thank God.
2 Corinthians,9,13,"The way in which you have proved yourselves by this service will bring honour and praise to God. You believed the message about Christ, and you obeyed it by sharing generously with God's people and with everyone else."
2 Corinthians,9,14,"Now they are praying for you and want to see you, because God used you to bless them so very much."
2 Corinthians,9,15,Thank God for his gift that is too wonderful for words!
2 Corinthians,10,1,"Do you think I am a coward when I am with you and brave when I am far away? Well, I ask you to listen, because Christ himself was humble and gentle."
2 Corinthians,10,2,"Some people have said that we act like the people of this world. So when I arrive, I expect I will have to be firm and forceful in what I say to them. Please don't make me treat you that way."
2 Corinthians,10,3,"We live in this world, but we don't act like its people"
2 Corinthians,10,4,"or fight our battles with the weapons of this world. Instead, we use God's power that can destroy fortresses. We destroy arguments"
2 Corinthians,10,5,and every bit of pride that keeps anyone from knowing God. We capture people's thoughts and make them obey Christ.
2 Corinthians,10,6,"And when you completely obey him, we will punish anyone who refuses to obey."
2 Corinthians,10,7,"You judge by appearances. If any of you think you are the only ones who belong to Christ, then think again. We belong to Christ as much as you do."
2 Corinthians,10,8,Perhaps I boast a little too much about the authority that the Lord gave me to help you and not to hurt you. Yet I am not embarrassed to boast.
2 Corinthians,10,9,And I am not trying to scare you with my letters.
2 Corinthians,10,10,"Some of you are saying, “Paul's letters are harsh and powerful. But in person, he is a weakling and has nothing worth saying.”"
2 Corinthians,10,11,"Those people had better understand that when I am with you, I will do exactly what I say in my letters."
2 Corinthians,10,12,We won't dare compare ourselves with those who think so much of themselves. But they are foolish to compare themselves with themselves.
2 Corinthians,10,13,"We won't boast about something we don't have a right to boast about. We will only boast about the work that God has sent us to do, and you are part of that work."
2 Corinthians,10,14,"We are not boasting more than we should. After all, we did bring the message about Christ to you."
2 Corinthians,10,15,"We don't boast about what others have done, as if we had done those things ourselves. But I hope that as you become stronger in your faith, we will be able to reach many more of the people around you. That has always been our goal."
2 Corinthians,10,16,Then we will be able to preach the good news in other lands where we cannot take credit for work someone else has already done.
2 Corinthians,10,17,"The Scriptures say, “If you want to boast, then boast about the Lord.”"
2 Corinthians,10,18,"You may boast about yourself, but the only approval that counts is the Lord's approval."
2 Corinthians,11,1,Please put up with a little of my foolishness.
2 Corinthians,11,2,I am as concerned about you as God is. You were like a virgin bride I had chosen only for Christ.
2 Corinthians,11,3,"But now I fear that you will be tricked, just as Eve was tricked by that lying snake. I am afraid that you might stop thinking about Christ in an honest and sincere way."
2 Corinthians,11,4,"We told you about Jesus, and you received the Holy Spirit and accepted our message. But you let some people tell you about another Jesus. Now you are ready to receive another spirit and accept a different message."
2 Corinthians,11,5,I think I am as good as any of those super apostles.
2 Corinthians,11,6,"I may not speak as well as they do, but I know as much. And this has already been made perfectly clear to you."
2 Corinthians,11,7,Was it wrong for me to lower myself and honour you by preaching God's message free of charge?
2 Corinthians,11,8,I robbed other churches by taking money from them to serve you.
2 Corinthians,11,9,"Even when I was in need, I still didn't bother you. In fact, some of the Lord's followers from Macedonia brought me what I needed. I have not been a burden to you in the past, and I will never be a burden."
2 Corinthians,11,10,"As surely as I speak the truth about Christ, no one in Achaia can stop me from boasting about this."
2 Corinthians,11,11,And it isn't because I don't love you. God himself knows how much I do love you.
2 Corinthians,11,12,I plan to go on doing just what I have always done. Then those people won't be able to boast about doing the same things we are doing.
2 Corinthians,11,13,"Anyway, they are no more than false apostles and dishonest workers. They only pretend to be apostles of Christ."
2 Corinthians,11,14,And it is no wonder. Even Satan tries to make himself look like an angel of light.
2 Corinthians,11,15,So why does it seem strange for Satan's servants to pretend to do what is right? Some day they will get exactly what they deserve.
2 Corinthians,11,16,"I don't want any of you to think that I am a fool. But if you do, then let me be a fool and boast a little."
2 Corinthians,11,17,"When I do all this boasting, I do it as a fool and not for the Lord."
2 Corinthians,11,18,"Yet if others want to boast about what they have done, so will I."
2 Corinthians,11,19,"And since you are so clever, you will gladly put up with a fool."
2 Corinthians,11,20,"In fact, you let people make slaves of you and cheat you and steal from you. Why, you even let them strut around and slap you in the face."
2 Corinthians,11,21,"I am ashamed to say that we are too weak to behave in such a way. If they can boast, so can I, but it is a foolish thing to do."
2 Corinthians,11,22,"Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Jews? So am I. Are they from the family of Abraham? Well, so am I."
2 Corinthians,11,23,"Are they servants of Christ? I am a fool to talk this way, but I serve him better than they do. I have worked harder and have been put in jail more times. I have been beaten with whips more and have been in danger of death more often."
2 Corinthians,11,24,Five times the Jews gave me thirty-nine lashes with a whip.
2 Corinthians,11,25,"Three times the Romans beat me with a big stick, and once my enemies stoned me. I have been shipwrecked three times, and I even had to spend a night and a day in the sea."
2 Corinthians,11,26,"During my many travels, I have been in danger from rivers, robbers, my own people, and foreigners. My life has been in danger in cities, in deserts, at sea, and with people who only pretended to be the Lord's followers."
2 Corinthians,11,27,I have worked and struggled and spent many sleepless nights. I have gone hungry and thirsty and often had nothing to eat. I have been cold from not having enough clothes to keep me warm.
2 Corinthians,11,28,"Besides everything else, each day I am burdened down, worrying about all the churches."
2 Corinthians,11,29,"When others are weak, I am weak too. When others are tricked into sin, I get angry."
2 Corinthians,11,30,"If I have to boast, I will boast about how weak I am."
2 Corinthians,11,31,"God, the Father of our Lord Jesus, knows I am not lying. And God is to be praised for ever!"
2 Corinthians,11,32,"The governor of Damascus at the time of King Aretas had the city gates guarded, so that he could capture me."
2 Corinthians,11,33,But I escaped by being let down in a basket through a window in the city wall.
2 Corinthians,12,1,"I have to boast. There is nothing to be gained by it, but I must boast about the visions and other things that the Lord has shown me."
2 Corinthians,12,2,"I know about one of Christ's followers who was taken up into the third heaven fourteen years ago. I don't know if the man was still in his body when it happened, but God certainly knows."
2 Corinthians,12,3,"As I said, only God really knows if this man was in his body at the time."
2 Corinthians,12,4,"But he was taken up into paradise, where he heard things that are too wonderful to tell."
2 Corinthians,12,5,"I will boast about that man, but not about myself, except to say how weak I am."
2 Corinthians,12,6,"Yet even if I did boast, I would not be foolish. I would simply be speaking the truth. But I will try not to say too much. That way, none of you will think more highly of me than you should because of what you have seen me do and say."
2 Corinthians,12,7,"Of course, I am now referring to the wonderful things I saw. One of Satan's angels was sent to make me suffer terribly, so that I would not feel too proud."
2 Corinthians,12,8,Three times I begged the Lord to make this suffering go away.
2 Corinthians,12,9,"But he replied, “My kindness is all you need. My power is strongest when you are weak.” So if Christ keeps giving me his power, I will gladly boast about how weak I am."
2 Corinthians,12,10,"Yes, I am glad to be weak or insulted or ill-treated or to have troubles and sufferings, if it is for Christ. Because when I am weak, I am strong."
2 Corinthians,12,11,"I have been making a fool of myself. But you forced me to do it, when you should have been speaking up for me. I may be nothing at all, but I am as good as those super apostles."
2 Corinthians,12,12,"When I was with you, I was patient and worked all the powerful miracles and signs and wonders of a true apostle."
2 Corinthians,12,13,"You missed out on only one blessing that the other churches received. That is, you didn't have to support me. Forgive me for doing you wrong."
2 Corinthians,12,14,"I am planning to visit you for the third time. But I still won't make a burden of myself. What I really want is you, and not what you have. Children are not supposed to save up for their parents, but parents are supposed to take care of their children."
2 Corinthians,12,15,So I will gladly give all that I have and all that I am. Will you love me less for loving you too much?
2 Corinthians,12,16,You agree that I wasn't a burden to you. Perhaps that's because I was trying to catch you off guard and trick you.
2 Corinthians,12,17,Were you cheated by any of those I sent to you?
2 Corinthians,12,18,"I urged Titus to visit you, and I sent another follower with him. But Titus didn't cheat you, and we felt and behaved the same way he did."
2 Corinthians,12,19,"Have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves to you? Actually, we have been speaking to God as followers of Christ. But, my friends, we did it all for your good."
2 Corinthians,12,20,"I am afraid that when I come, we won't be pleased with each other. I fear that some of you may be arguing or jealous or angry or selfish or gossiping or insulting each other. I even fear that you may be proud and acting like a mob."
2 Corinthians,12,21,"I am afraid God will make me ashamed when I visit you again. I will feel like crying because many of you have never given up your old sins. You are still doing things that are immoral, indecent, and shameful."
2 Corinthians,13,1,"I am on my way to visit you for the third time. And as the Scriptures say, “Any charges must be proved true by at least two or three witnesses.”"
2 Corinthians,13,2,"During my second visit I warned you that I would punish you and anyone else who doesn't stop sinning. I am far away from you now, but I give you the same warning."
2 Corinthians,13,3,"This should prove to you that I am speaking for Christ. When he corrects you, he won't be weak. He will be powerful!"
2 Corinthians,13,4,"Although he was weak when he was nailed to the cross, he now lives by the power of God. We are weak, just as Christ was. But you will see that we will live by the power of God, just as Christ does."
2 Corinthians,13,5,"Test yourselves and find out if you really are true to your faith. If you pass the test, you will discover that Christ is living in you. But if Christ isn't living in you, you have failed."
2 Corinthians,13,6,I hope you will discover that we have not failed.
2 Corinthians,13,7,"We pray that you will stop doing evil things. We don't pray like this to make ourselves look good, but to get you to do right, even if we are failures."
2 Corinthians,13,8,All we can do is to follow the truth and not fight against it.
2 Corinthians,13,9,"Even though we are weak, we are glad that you are strong, and we pray that you will do even better."
2 Corinthians,13,10,"I am writing these things to you before I arrive. This way I won't have to be hard on you when I use the authority that the Lord has given me. I was given this authority, so that I could help you and not destroy you."
2 Corinthians,13,11,"Goodbye, my friends. Do better and pay attention to what I have said. Try to get along and live peacefully with each other. Now I pray that God, who gives love and peace, will be with you."
2 Corinthians,13,12,Give each other a warm greeting. All God's people send their greetings.
2 Corinthians,13,13,"I pray that the Lord Jesus Christ will bless you and be kind to you! May God bless you with his love, and may the Holy Spirit join all your hearts together."
Galatians,2,1,Fourteen years later I went to Jerusalem with Barnabas. I also took along Titus.
Galatians,2,2,"But I went there because God had told me to go, and I explained the good news that I had been preaching to the Gentiles. Then I met privately with the ones who seemed to be the most important leaders. I wanted to make sure that my work in the past and my future work would not be for nothing."
Galatians,2,3,"Titus went to Jerusalem with me. He was a Greek, but still he wasn't forced to be circumcised."
Galatians,2,4,"We went there because of those who pretended to be followers and had sneaked in among us as spies. They had come to take away the freedom that Christ Jesus had given us, and they were trying to make us their slaves."
Galatians,2,5,"But we wanted you to have the true message. That's why we didn't give in to them, not even for a second."
Galatians,2,6,"Some of them were supposed to be important leaders, but I didn't care who they were. God doesn't have any favourites! None of these so called special leaders added anything to my message."
Galatians,2,7,"They realized that God had sent me with the good news for Gentiles, and that he had sent Peter with the same message for Jews."
Galatians,2,8,"God, who had sent Peter on a mission to the Jews, was now using me to preach to the Gentiles."
Galatians,2,9,"James, Peter, and John realized that God had given me the message about his undeserved kindness. And these men are supposed to be the backbone of the church. They even gave Barnabas and me a friendly handshake. This was to show that we would work with Gentiles and that they would work with Jews."
Galatians,2,10,"They only asked us to remember the poor, and that was something I had always been eager to do."
Galatians,2,11,"When Peter came to Antioch, I told him face to face that he was wrong."
Galatians,2,12,"He used to eat with Gentile followers of the Lord, until James sent some Jewish followers. Peter was afraid of the Jews and soon stopped eating with Gentiles."
Galatians,2,13,He and the other Jews hid their true feelings so well that even Barnabas was fooled.
Galatians,2,14,"But when I saw that they were not really obeying the truth that is in the good news, I corrected Peter in front of everyone and said: Peter, you are a Jew, but you live like a Gentile. So how can you force Gentiles to live like Jews?"
Galatians,2,15,We are Jews by birth and are not sinners like Gentiles.
Galatians,2,16,"But we know that God accepts only those who have faith in Jesus Christ. No one can please God by simply obeying the Law. So we put our faith in Christ Jesus, and God accepted us because of our faith."
Galatians,2,17,"When we Jews started looking for a way to please God, we discovered that we are sinners too. Does this mean that Christ is the one who makes us sinners? No, it doesn't!"
Galatians,2,18,"But if I tear down something and then build it again, I prove that I was wrong at first."
Galatians,2,19,"It was the Law itself that killed me and freed me from its power, so that I could live for God. I have been nailed to the cross with Christ."
Galatians,2,20,"I have died, but Christ lives in me. And I now live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave his life for me."
Galatians,2,21,"I don't turn my back on God's undeserved kindness. If we can be acceptable to God by obeying the Law, it was useless for Christ to die."
Galatians,3,1,You stupid Galatians! I told you exactly how Jesus Christ was nailed to a cross. Has someone now put an evil spell on you?
Galatians,3,2,I want to know only one thing. How were you given God's Spirit? Was it by obeying the Law of Moses or by hearing about Christ and having faith in him?
Galatians,3,3,How can you be so stupid? Do you think that by yourself you can complete what God's Spirit started in you?
Galatians,3,4,Have you gone through all this for nothing? Is it all really for nothing?
Galatians,3,5,God gives you his Spirit and works miracles in you. But does he do this because you obey the Law of Moses or because you have heard about Christ and have faith in him?
Galatians,3,6,The Scriptures say that God accepted Abraham because Abraham had faith.
Galatians,3,7,"And so, you should understand that everyone who has faith is a child of Abraham."
Galatians,3,8,Long ago the Scriptures said that God would accept the Gentiles because of their faith. That's why God told Abraham the good news that all nations would be blessed because of him.
Galatians,3,9,This means that everyone who has faith will share in the blessings that were given to Abraham because of his faith.
Galatians,3,10,"Anyone who tries to please God by obeying the Law is under a curse. The Scriptures say, “Everyone who doesn't obey everything in the Law is under a curse.”"
Galatians,3,11,"No one can please God by obeying the Law. The Scriptures also say, “The people God accepts because of their faith will live.”"
Galatians,3,12,The Law isn't based on faith. It promises life only to people who obey its commands.
Galatians,3,13,"But Christ rescued us from the Law's curse, when he became a curse in our place. This is because the Scriptures say that anyone who is nailed to a tree is under a curse."
Galatians,3,14,"And because of what Jesus Christ has done, the blessing that was promised to Abraham was taken to the Gentiles. This happened so that by faith we would be given the promised Holy Spirit."
Galatians,3,15,"My friends, I will use an everyday example to explain what I mean. Once someone agrees to something, no one else can change or cancel the agreement."
Galatians,3,16,"That is how it is with the promises God made to Abraham and his descendant. The promises were not made to many descendants, but only to one, and that one is Christ."
Galatians,3,17,What I am saying is that the Law cannot change or cancel God's promise that was made 430 years before the Law was given.
Galatians,3,18,"If we have to obey the Law in order to receive God's blessings, those blessings don't really come to us because of God's promise. But God was kind to Abraham and made him a promise."
Galatians,3,19,"What is the use of the Law? It was given later to show that we sin. But it was only supposed to last until the coming of that descendant who was given the promise. In fact, angels gave the Law to Moses, and he gave it to the people."
Galatians,3,20,"There is only one God, and the Law did not come directly from him."
Galatians,3,21,"Does the Law disagree with God's promises? No, it doesn't! If any law could give life to us, we could become acceptable to God by obeying that law."
Galatians,3,22,"But the Scriptures say that sin controls everyone, so that God's promises will be for anyone who has faith in Jesus Christ."
Galatians,3,23,The Law controlled us and kept us under its power until the time came when we would have faith.
Galatians,3,24,"In fact, the Law was our teacher. It was supposed to teach us until we had faith and were acceptable to God."
Galatians,3,25,"But once a person has learnt to have faith, there is no more need to have the Law as a teacher."
Galatians,3,26,All of you are God's children because of your faith in Christ Jesus.
Galatians,3,27,"And when you were baptized, it was as though you had put on Christ in the same way you put on new clothes."
Galatians,3,28,"Faith in Christ Jesus is what makes each of you equal with each other, whether you are a Jew or a Greek, a slave or a free person, a man or a woman."
Galatians,3,29,"So if you belong to Christ, you are now part of Abraham's family, and you will be given what God has promised."
Galatians,4,1,"Children who are under age are no better off than slaves, even though everything their parents own will some day be theirs."
Galatians,4,2,This is because children are placed in the care of guardians and teachers until the time their parents have set.
Galatians,4,3,That is how it was with us. We were like children ruled by the powers of this world.
Galatians,4,4,"But when the time was right, God sent his Son, and a woman gave birth to him. His Son obeyed the Law,"
Galatians,4,5,"so he could set us free from the Law, and we could become God's children."
Galatians,4,6,"Now that we are his children, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts. And his Spirit tells us that God is our Father."
Galatians,4,7,"You are no longer slaves. You are God's children, and you will be given what he has promised."
Galatians,4,8,"Before you knew God, you were slaves of gods that are not real."
Galatians,4,9,"But now you know God, or better still, God knows you. How can you turn back and become the slaves of those weak and pitiful powers?"
Galatians,4,10,"You even celebrate certain days, months, seasons, and years."
Galatians,4,11,I am afraid I have wasted my time working with you.
Galatians,4,12,"My friends, I beg you to be like me, just as I once tried to be like you. Did you ill-treat me"
Galatians,4,13,"when I first preached to you? No you didn't, even though you knew I had come there because I was sick."
Galatians,4,14,"My illness must have caused you some trouble, but you didn't hate me or turn me away because of it. You welcomed me as though I were one of God's angels or even Christ Jesus himself."
Galatians,4,15,"Where is that good feeling now? I am sure that if it had been possible, you would have taken out your own eyes and given them to me."
Galatians,4,16,"Am I now your enemy, just because I told you the truth?"
Galatians,4,17,"Those people may be paying you a lot of attention, but it isn't for your good. They only want to keep you away from me, so you will pay them a lot of attention."
Galatians,4,18,"It is always good to give your attention to something worthwhile, even when I am not with you."
Galatians,4,19,"My children, I am in terrible pain until Christ may be seen living in you."
Galatians,4,20,I wish I were with you now. Then I would not have to talk this way. You really have me puzzled.
Galatians,4,21,Some of you would like to be under the rule of the Law of Moses. But do you know what the Law says?
Galatians,4,22,"In the Scriptures we learn that Abraham had two sons. The mother of one of them was a slave, while the mother of the other one had always been free."
Galatians,4,23,The son of the slave woman was born in the usual way. But the son of the free woman was born because of God's promise.
Galatians,4,24,"All this has another meaning as well. Each of the two women stands for one of the agreements God made with his people. Hagar, the slave woman, stands for the agreement that was made at Mount Sinai. Everyone born into her family is a slave."
Galatians,4,25,Hagar also stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and for the present city of Jerusalem. She and her children are slaves.
Galatians,4,26,"But our mother is the city of Jerusalem in heaven above, and she isn't a slave."
Galatians,4,27,"The Scriptures say about her, “You have never had children, but now you can be glad. You have never given birth, but now you can shout. Once you had no children, but now you will have more children than a woman who has been married for a long time.”"
Galatians,4,28,"My friends, you were born because of this promise, just as Isaac was."
Galatians,4,29,But the child who was born in the natural way made trouble for the child who was born because of the Spirit. The same thing is happening today.
Galatians,4,30,"The Scriptures say, “Get rid of the slave woman and her son! He won't be given anything. The son of the free woman will receive everything.”"
Galatians,4,31,"My friends, we are children of the free woman and not of the slave."
Galatians,5,1,Christ has set us free! This means we are really free. Now hold on to your freedom and don't ever become slaves of the Law again.
Galatians,5,2,"I, Paul, promise you that Christ won't do you any good if you get circumcised."
Galatians,5,3,"If you do, you must obey the whole Law."
Galatians,5,4,"And if you try to please God by obeying the Law, you have cut yourself off from Christ and his wonderful kindness."
Galatians,5,5,But the Spirit makes us sure that God will accept us because of our faith in Christ.
Galatians,5,6,"If you are a follower of Christ Jesus, it makes no difference whether you are circumcised or not. All that matters is your faith that makes you love others."
Galatians,5,7,You were doing so well until someone made you turn from the truth.
Galatians,5,8,And that person was certainly not sent by the one who chose you.
Galatians,5,9,"A little yeast can change a whole batch of dough,"
Galatians,5,10,"but you belong to the Lord. That makes me certain that you will do what I say, instead of what someone else tells you to do. Whoever is causing trouble for you will be punished."
Galatians,5,11,"My friends, if I still preach that people need to be circumcised, why am I in so much trouble? The message about the cross would no longer be a problem, if I told people to be circumcised."
Galatians,5,12,"I wish that everyone who is upsetting you would not only get circumcised, but would cut off much more!"
Galatians,5,13,"My friends, you were chosen to be free. So don't use your freedom as an excuse to do anything you want. Use it as an opportunity to serve each other with love."
Galatians,5,14,All that the Law says can be summed up in the command to love others as much as you love yourself.
Galatians,5,15,"But if you keep attacking each other like wild animals, you had better watch out or you will destroy yourselves."
Galatians,5,16,"If you are guided by the Spirit, you won't obey your selfish desires."
Galatians,5,17,The Spirit and your desires are enemies of each other. They are always fighting each other and keeping you from doing what you feel you should.
Galatians,5,18,"But if you obey the Spirit, the Law of Moses has no control over you."
Galatians,5,19,"People's desires make them give in to immoral ways, filthy thoughts, and shameful deeds."
Galatians,5,20,"They worship idols, practise witchcraft, hate others, and are hard to get along with. People become jealous, angry, and selfish. They not only argue and cause trouble, but they are"
Galatians,5,21,"envious. They get drunk, carry on at wild parties, and do other evil things as well. I told you before, and I am telling you again: no one who does these things will share in the blessings of God's kingdom."
Galatians,5,22,"God's Spirit makes us loving, happy, peaceful, patient, kind, good, faithful,"
Galatians,5,23,"gentle, and self-controlled. There is no law against behaving in any of these ways."
Galatians,5,24,"And because we belong to Christ Jesus, we have killed our selfish feelings and desires."
Galatians,5,25,"God's Spirit has given us life, and so we should follow the Spirit."
Galatians,5,26,But don't be conceited or make others jealous by claiming to be better than they are.
Galatians,6,1,"My friends, you are spiritual. So if someone is trapped in sin, you should gently lead that person back to the right path. But watch out, and don't be tempted yourself."
Galatians,6,2,You obey the law of Christ when you offer each other a helping hand.
Galatians,6,3,"If you think you are better than others, when you really aren't, you are wrong."
Galatians,6,4,"Do your own work well, and then you will have something to be proud of. But don't compare yourself with others."
Galatians,6,5,We each must carry our own load.
Galatians,6,6,Share every good thing you have with anyone who teaches you what God has said.
Galatians,6,7,"You cannot fool God, so don't make a fool of yourself! You will harvest what you plant."
Galatians,6,8,"If you follow your selfish desires, you will harvest destruction, but if you follow the Spirit, you will harvest eternal life."
Galatians,6,9,"Don't get tired of helping others. You will be rewarded when the time is right, if you don't give up."
Galatians,6,10,"We should help people whenever we can, especially if they are followers of the Lord."
Galatians,6,11,You can see what big letters I make when I write with my own hand.
Galatians,6,12,Those people who are telling you to get circumcised are only trying to show how important they are. And they don't want to get into trouble for preaching about the cross of Christ.
Galatians,6,13,"They are circumcised, but they don't obey the Law of Moses. All they want is to boast about having you circumcised."
Galatians,6,14,"But I will never boast about anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. Because of his cross, the world is dead as far as I am concerned, and I am dead as far as the world is concerned."
Galatians,6,15,It doesn't matter if you are circumcised or not. All that matters is that you are a new person.
Galatians,6,16,"If you follow this rule, you will belong to God's true people. God will treat you with undeserved kindness and will bless you with peace."
Galatians,6,17,On my own body are scars that prove I belong to Christ Jesus. So I don't want anyone to bother me any more.
Galatians,6,18,"My friends, I pray that the Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you! Amen."
Ephesians,1,1,"From Paul, chosen by God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus. To God's people who live in Ephesus and are faithful followers of Christ Jesus."
Ephesians,1,2,I pray that God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you and will bless you with peace!
Ephesians,1,3,Praise the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ for the spiritual blessings that Christ has brought us from heaven!
Ephesians,1,4,"Before the world was created, God had Christ choose us to live with him and to be his holy and innocent and loving people."
Ephesians,1,5,God was kind and decided that Christ would choose us to be God's own adopted children.
Ephesians,1,6,"God was very kind to us because of the Son he dearly loves, and so we should praise God."
Ephesians,2,1,In the past you were dead because you sinned and fought against God.
Ephesians,2,2,"You followed the ways of this world and obeyed the devil. He rules the world, and his spirit has power over everyone who doesn't obey God."
Ephesians,2,3,"Once we were also ruled by the selfish desires of our bodies and minds. We had made God angry, and we were going to be punished like everyone else."
Ephesians,3,1,"Christ Jesus made me his prisoner, so that I could help you Gentiles."
Ephesians,3,2,You have heard about God's kindness in choosing me to help you.
Ephesians,3,3,"In fact, this letter tells you a little about how God has shown me his mysterious ways."
Ephesians,3,4,"As you read the letter, you will also find out how well I really do understand the mystery about Christ."
Ephesians,3,5,No one knew about this mystery until God's Spirit told it to his holy apostles and prophets.
Ephesians,3,6,"And the mystery is this: Because of Christ Jesus, the good news has given the Gentiles a share in the promises that God gave to the Jews. God has also let the Gentiles be part of the same body."
Ephesians,3,7,"God treated me with kindness. His power worked in me, and it became my job to spread the good news."
Ephesians,3,8,I am the least important of all God's people. But God was kind and chose me to tell the Gentiles that because of Christ there are blessings that cannot be measured.
Ephesians,3,9,"God, who created everything, wanted me to help everyone understand the mysterious plan that had always been hidden in his mind."
Ephesians,3,10,Then God would use the church to show the powers and authorities in the spiritual world that he has many different kinds of wisdom.
Ephesians,3,11,God did this according to his eternal plan. And he was able to do what he had planned because of all that Christ Jesus our Lord had done.
Ephesians,3,12,"Christ now gives us courage and confidence, so that we can come to God by faith."
Ephesians,3,13,"That's why you should not be discouraged when I suffer for you. After all, it will bring honour to you."
Ephesians,3,14,I kneel in prayer to the Father.
Ephesians,3,15,All beings in heaven and on earth receive their life from him.
Ephesians,3,16,God is wonderful and glorious. I pray that his Spirit will make you become strong followers
Ephesians,3,17,and that Christ will live in your hearts because of your faith. Stand firm and be deeply rooted in his love.
Ephesians,3,18,I pray that you and all God's people will understand what is called wide or long or high or deep.
Ephesians,3,19,"I want you to know-all about Christ's love, although it is too wonderful to be measured. Then your lives will be filled with all that God is."
Ephesians,4,1,"As a prisoner of the Lord, I beg you to live in a way that is worthy of the people God has chosen to be his own."
Ephesians,4,2,Always be humble and gentle. Patiently put up with each other and love each other.
Ephesians,4,3,Try your best to let God's Spirit keep your hearts united. Do this by living at peace.
Ephesians,4,4,"All of you are part of the same body. There is only one Spirit of God, just as you were given one hope when you were chosen to be God's people."
Ephesians,4,5,"We have only one Lord, one faith, and one baptism."
Ephesians,4,6,"There is one God who is the Father of all people. Not only is God above all others, but he works by using all of us, and he lives in all of us."
Ephesians,4,7,Christ has generously divided out his gifts to us.
Ephesians,4,8,"As the Scriptures say, “When he went up to the highest place, he led away many prisoners and gave gifts to people.”"
Ephesians,4,9,"When it says, “he went up”, it means that Christ had been deep in the earth."
Ephesians,4,10,"This also means that the one who went deep into the earth is the same one who went into the highest heaven, so that he would fill the whole universe."
Ephesians,4,11,"Christ chose some of us to be apostles, prophets, missionaries, pastors, and teachers,"
Ephesians,4,12,so that his people would learn to serve and his body would grow strong.
Ephesians,4,13,"This will continue until we are united by our faith and by our understanding of the Son of God. Then we will be mature, just as Christ is, and we will be completely like him."
Ephesians,4,14,"We must stop acting like children. We must not let deceitful people trick us by their false teachings, which are like winds that toss us around from place to place."
Ephesians,4,15,"Love should always make us tell the truth. Then we will grow in every way and be more like Christ, the head"
Ephesians,4,16,"of the body. Christ holds it together and makes all its parts work perfectly, as it grows and becomes strong because of love."
Ephesians,4,17,"As a follower of the Lord, I order you to stop living like stupid, godless people."
Ephesians,4,18,"Their minds are in the dark, and they are stubborn and ignorant and have missed out on the life that comes from God. They no longer have any feelings about what is right,"
Ephesians,4,19,and they are so greedy that they do all kinds of indecent things.
Ephesians,5,1,"Do as God does. After all, you are his dear children."
Ephesians,5,2,Let love be your guide. Christ loved us and offered his life for us as a sacrifice that pleases God.
Ephesians,5,3,"You are God's people, so don't let it be said that any of you are immoral or indecent or greedy."
Ephesians,5,4,"Don't use dirty or foolish or filthy words. Instead, say how thankful you are."
Ephesians,5,5,"Being greedy, indecent, or immoral is just another way of worshipping idols. You can be sure that people who behave in this way will never be part of the kingdom that belongs to Christ and to God."
Ephesians,5,6,Don't let anyone trick you with foolish talk. God punishes everyone who disobeys him and says foolish things.
Ephesians,5,7,So don't have anything to do with anyone like that.
Ephesians,5,8,"You used to be like people living in the dark, but now you are people of the light because you belong to the Lord. So act like people of the light"
Ephesians,5,9,"and make your light shine. Be good and honest and truthful,"
Ephesians,5,10,as you try to please the Lord.
Ephesians,5,11,"Don't take part in doing those worthless things that are done in the dark. Instead, show how wrong they are."
Ephesians,5,12,It is disgusting even to talk about what is done in the dark.
Ephesians,5,13,But the light will show what these things are really like.
Ephesians,5,14,"Light shows up everything, just as the Scriptures say, “Wake up from your sleep and rise from death. Then Christ will shine on you.”"
Ephesians,5,15,Act like people with good sense and not like fools.
Ephesians,5,16,"These are evil times, so make every minute count."
Ephesians,5,17,"Don't be stupid. Instead, find out what the Lord wants you to do."
Ephesians,5,18,"Don't destroy yourself by getting drunk, but let the Spirit fill your life."
Ephesians,5,19,"When you meet together, sing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, as you praise the Lord with all your heart."
Ephesians,5,20,Always use the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to thank God the Father for everything.
Ephesians,5,21,Honour Christ and put others first.
Ephesians,5,22,"A wife should put her husband first, as she does the Lord."
Ephesians,5,23,"A husband is the head of his wife, as Christ is the head and the Saviour of the church, which is his own body."
Ephesians,5,24,"Wives should always put their husbands first, as the church puts Christ first."
Ephesians,5,25,A husband should love his wife as much as Christ loved the church and gave his life for it.
Ephesians,5,26,"He made the church holy by the power of his word, and he made it pure by washing it with water."
Ephesians,5,27,"Christ did this, so that he would have a glorious and holy church, without faults or spots or wrinkles or any other flaws."
Ephesians,5,28,"In the same way, a husband should love his wife as much as he loves himself. A husband who loves his wife shows that he loves himself."
Ephesians,5,29,"None of us hate our own bodies. We provide for them and take good care of them, just as Christ does for the church,"
Ephesians,5,30,because we are each part of his body.
Ephesians,5,31,"As the Scriptures say, “A man leaves his father and mother to get married, and he becomes like one person with his wife.”"
Ephesians,5,32,"This is a great mystery, but I understand it to mean Christ and his church."
Ephesians,5,33,"So each husband should love his wife as much as he loves himself, and each wife should respect her husband."
Ephesians,6,1,"Children, you belong to the Lord, and you do the right thing when you obey your parents. The first commandment with a promise says,"
Ephesians,6,2,"“Obey your father and your mother,"
Ephesians,6,3,and you will have a long and happy life.”
Ephesians,6,4,"Parents, don't be hard on your children. Raise them properly. Teach them and instruct them about the Lord."
Ephesians,6,5,"Slaves, you must obey your earthly masters. Show them great respect and be as loyal to them as you are to Christ."
Ephesians,6,6,"Try to please them at all times, and not just when you think they are watching. You are slaves of Christ, so with your whole heart you must do what God wants you to do."
Ephesians,6,7,"Gladly serve your masters, as though they were the Lord himself, and not simply people."
Ephesians,6,8,"You know that you will be rewarded for any good things you do, whether you are slaves or free."
Ephesians,6,9,"Slave owners, you must treat your slaves with this same respect. Don't threaten them. They have the same Master in heaven that you do, and he doesn't have any favourites."
Ephesians,6,10,"Finally, let the mighty strength of the Lord make you strong."
Ephesians,6,11,"Put on all the armour that God gives, so you can defend yourself against the devil's tricks."
Ephesians,6,12,We are not fighting against humans. We are fighting against forces and authorities and against rulers of darkness and powers in the spiritual world.
Ephesians,6,13,"So put on all the armour that God gives. Then when that evil day comes, you will be able to defend yourself. And when the battle is over, you will still be standing firm."
Ephesians,6,14,"Be ready! Let the truth be like a belt around your waist, and let God's justice protect you like armour."
Ephesians,6,15,Your desire to tell the good news about peace should be like shoes on your feet.
Ephesians,6,16,"Let your faith be like a shield, and you will be able to stop all the flaming arrows of the evil one."
Ephesians,6,17,"Let God's saving power be like a helmet, and for a sword use God's message that comes from the Spirit."
Ephesians,6,18,"Never stop praying, especially for others. Always pray by the power of the Spirit. Stay alert and keep praying for God's people."
Ephesians,6,19,Pray that I will be given the message to speak and that I may fearlessly explain the mystery about the good news.
Ephesians,6,20,"I was sent to do this work, and that's the reason I am in jail. So pray that I will be brave and will speak as I should."
Philippians,1,1,"From Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus. To all God's people who belong to Christ Jesus at Philippi and to all your church officials and officers."
Philippians,1,2,I pray that God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you and will bless you with peace!
Philippians,1,3,"Every time I think of you, I thank my God."
Philippians,1,4,"And whenever I mention you in my prayers, it makes me happy."
Philippians,1,5,This is because you have taken part with me in spreading the good news from the first day you heard about it.
Philippians,1,6,"God is the one who began this good work in you, and I am certain that he won't stop before it is complete on the day that Christ Jesus returns."
Philippians,1,7,"You have a special place in my heart. So it is only natural for me to feel the way I do. All of you have helped in the work that God has given me, as I defend the good news and tell about it here in jail."
Philippians,1,8,God himself knows how much I want to see you. He knows that I care for you in the same way that Christ Jesus does.
Philippians,1,9,I pray that your love will keep on growing and that you will fully know and understand
Philippians,1,10,"how to make the right choices. Then you will still be pure and innocent when Christ returns. And until that day,"
Philippians,1,11,Jesus Christ will keep you busy doing good deeds that bring glory and praise to God.
Philippians,1,12,"My dear friends, I want you to know that what has happened to me has helped to spread the good news."
Philippians,1,13,The Roman guards and all the others know that I am here in jail because I serve Christ.
Philippians,1,14,Now most of the Lord's followers have become brave and are fearlessly telling the message.
Philippians,1,15,Some are preaching about Christ because they are jealous and envious of us. Others are preaching because they want to help.
Philippians,1,16,They love Christ and know that I am here to defend the good news about him.
Philippians,1,17,But the ones who are jealous of us are not sincere. They just want to cause trouble for me while I am in jail.
Philippians,1,18,"But that doesn't matter. All that matters is that people are telling about Christ, whether they are sincere or not. That is what makes me glad. I will keep on being glad,"
Philippians,1,19,because I know that your prayers and the help that comes from the Spirit of Christ Jesus will keep me safe.
Philippians,1,20,"I honestly expect and hope that I will never do anything to be ashamed of. Whether I live or die, I always want to be as brave as I am now and bring honour to Christ."
Philippians,1,21,"If I live, it will be for Christ, and if I die, I will gain even more."
Philippians,1,22,I don't know what to choose. I could keep on living and doing something useful.
Philippians,1,23,"It is a hard choice to make. I want to die and be with Christ, because that would be much better."
Philippians,2,1,"Christ encourages you, and his love comforts you. God's Spirit unites you, and you are concerned for others."
Philippians,2,2,"Now make me completely happy! Live in harmony by showing love for each other. Be united in what you think, as if you were only one person."
Philippians,2,3,"Don't be jealous or proud, but be humble and consider others more important than yourselves."
Philippians,2,4,Care about them as much as you care about yourselves
Philippians,2,5,and think the same way that Christ Jesus thought:
Philippians,2,6,Christ was truly God. But he did not try to remain equal with God.
Philippians,2,7,"Instead he gave up everything and became a slave, when he became like one of us."
Philippians,2,8,Christ was humble. He obeyed God and even died on a cross.
Philippians,2,9,Then God gave Christ the highest place and honoured his name above all others.
Philippians,2,10,"So at the name of Jesus everyone will bow down, those in heaven, on earth, and under the earth."
Philippians,2,11,"And to the glory of God the Father everyone will openly agree, “Jesus Christ is Lord!”"
Philippians,2,12,"My dear friends, you always obeyed when I was with you. Now that I am away, you should obey even more. So work with fear and trembling to discover what it really means to be saved."
Philippians,2,13,God is working in you to make you willing and able to obey him.
Philippians,2,14,Do everything without grumbling or arguing.
Philippians,2,15,"Then you will be the pure and innocent children of God. You live among people who are crooked and evil, but you must not do anything that they can say is wrong. Try to shine as lights among the people of this world,"
Philippians,2,16,"as you hold firmly to the message that gives life. Then on the day when Christ returns, I can take pride in you. I can also know that my work and efforts were not useless."
Philippians,2,17,"Your faith in the Lord and your service are like a sacrifice offered to him. And my own blood may have to be poured out with the sacrifice. If this happens, I will be glad and rejoice with you."
Philippians,2,18,"In the same way, you should be glad and rejoice with me."
Philippians,2,19,I want to be encouraged by news about you. So I hope the Lord Jesus will soon let me send Timothy to you.
Philippians,2,20,I don't have anyone else who cares about you as much as he does.
Philippians,2,21,The others think only about what interests them and not about what concerns Christ Jesus.
Philippians,2,22,But you know what kind of person Timothy is. He has worked with me like a son in spreading the good news.
Philippians,2,23,"I hope to send him to you, as soon as I find out what is going to happen to me."
Philippians,2,24,And I feel sure that the Lord will also let me come soon.
Philippians,2,25,"I think I ought to send my dear friend Epaphroditus back to you. He is a follower and a worker and a soldier of the Lord, just as I am. You sent him to look after me,"
Philippians,2,26,"but now he is eager to see you. He is worried, because you heard he was sick."
Philippians,2,27,"In fact, he was very sick and almost died. But God was kind to him, and also to me, and he kept me from being burdened down with sorrow."
Philippians,2,28,"Now I am more eager than ever to send Epaphroditus back again. You will be glad to see him, and I won't have to worry any longer."
Philippians,2,29,"Be sure to give him a cheerful welcome, just as people who serve the Lord deserve."
Philippians,2,30,"He almost died working for Christ, and he risked his own life to do for me what you could not."
Philippians,3,1,"Finally, my dear friends, be glad that you belong to the Lord. It doesn't bother me to write the same things to you that I have written before. In fact, it is for your own good."
Philippians,3,2,Watch out for those people who behave like dogs! They are evil and want to do more than just circumcise you.
Philippians,3,3,"But we are the ones who are truly circumcised, because we worship by the power of God's Spirit and take pride in Christ Jesus. We don't boast about what we have done,"
Philippians,3,4,"although I could. Others may boast about themselves, but I have more reason to boast than anyone else."
Philippians,3,5,"I was circumcised when I was eight days old, and I am from the nation of Israel and the tribe of Benjamin. I am a true Hebrew. As a Pharisee, I strictly obeyed the Law of Moses."
Philippians,3,6,And I was so eager that I even made trouble for the church. I did everything the Law demands in order to please God.
Philippians,3,7,But Christ has shown me that what I once thought was valuable is worthless.
Philippians,3,8,Nothing is as wonderful as knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. I have given up everything else and count it all as rubbish. All I want is Christ
Philippians,3,9,and to know that I belong to him. I could not make myself acceptable to God by obeying the Law of Moses. God accepted me simply because of my faith in Christ.
Philippians,3,10,"All I want is to know Christ and the power that raised him to life. I want to suffer and die as he did,"
Philippians,3,11,so that somehow I also may be raised to life.
Philippians,3,12,"I have not yet reached my goal, and I am not perfect. But Christ has taken hold of me. So I keep on running and struggling to take hold of the prize."
Philippians,3,13,"My friends, I don't feel that I have already arrived. But I forget what is behind, and I struggle for what is ahead."
Philippians,3,14,"I run towards the goal, so that I can win the prize of being called to heaven. This is the prize that God offers because of what Christ Jesus has done."
Philippians,3,15,"All of us who are mature should think in this same way. And if any of you think differently, God will make it clear to you."
Philippians,3,16,But we must keep going in the direction that we are now headed.
Philippians,3,17,"My friends, I want you to follow my example and learn from others who closely follow the example we set for you."
Philippians,3,18,"I often warned you that many people are living as enemies of the cross of Christ. And now with tears in my eyes, I warn you again"
Philippians,3,19,that they are headed for hell! They worship their stomachs and boast about the disgusting things they do. All they can think about are the things of this world.
Philippians,3,20,But we are citizens of heaven and are eagerly waiting for our Saviour to come from there. Our Lord Jesus Christ
Philippians,3,21,"has power over everything, and he will make these poor bodies of ours like his own glorious body."
Philippians,4,1,"Dear friends, I love you and long to see you. Please keep on being faithful to the Lord. You are my pride and joy."
Philippians,4,2,"Euodia and Syntyche, you belong to the Lord, so I beg you to stop arguing with each other."
Philippians,4,3,"And, my true partner, I ask you to help them. These women have worked together with me and with Clement and with the others in spreading the good news. Their names are now written in the book of life."
Philippians,4,4,Always be glad because of the Lord! I will say it again: be glad.
Philippians,4,5,Always be gentle with others. The Lord will soon be here.
Philippians,4,6,"Don't worry about anything, but pray about everything. With thankful hearts offer up your prayers and requests to God."
Philippians,4,7,"Then, because you belong to Christ Jesus, God will bless you with peace that no one can completely understand. And this peace will control the way you think and feel."
Philippians,4,8,"Finally, my friends, keep your minds on whatever is true, pure, right, holy, friendly, and proper. Don't ever stop thinking about what is truly worthwhile and worthy of praise."
Philippians,4,9,"You know the teachings I gave you, and you know what you heard me say and saw me do. So follow my example. And God, who gives peace, will be with you."
Philippians,4,10,"The Lord has made me very grateful that at last you have thought about me once again. Actually, you were thinking about me all along, but you didn't have any chance to show it."
Philippians,4,11,I am not complaining about having too little. I have learnt to be satisfied with whatever I have.
Philippians,4,12,"I know what it is to be poor or to have plenty, and I have lived under all kinds of conditions. I know what it means to be full or to be hungry, to have too much or too little."
Philippians,4,13,Christ gives me the strength to face anything.
Philippians,4,14,It was good of you to help me when I was having such a hard time.
Philippians,4,15,"My friends at Philippi, you remember what it was like when I started preaching the good news in Macedonia. After I left there, you were the only church that became my partner by giving blessings and by receiving them in return."
Philippians,4,16,"Even when I was in Thessalonica, you helped me more than once."
Philippians,4,17,"I am not trying to get something from you, but I want you to receive the blessings that come from giving."
Philippians,4,18,"I have been paid back everything, and with interest. I am completely satisfied with the gifts that you asked Epaphroditus to bring me. They are like a sweet-smelling offering or like the right kind of sacrifice that pleases God."
Philippians,4,19,I pray that God will take care of all your needs with the wonderful blessings that come from Christ Jesus!
Philippians,4,20,May God our Father be praised for ever and ever. Amen.
Philippians,4,21,Give my greetings to all who are God's people because of Christ Jesus. The Lord's followers here with me send you their greetings.
Philippians,4,22,"All God's people send their greetings, especially those in the service of the Emperor."
Philippians,4,23,I pray that our Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you and will bless your life!
Colossians,1,1,"From Paul, chosen by God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus, and from Timothy, who is also a follower."
Colossians,1,2,To God's people who live in Colossae and are faithful followers of Christ. I pray that God our Father will be kind to you and will bless you with peace!
Colossians,1,3,"Each time we pray for you, we thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ."
Colossians,1,4,"We have heard of your faith in Christ and of your love for all God's people,"
Colossians,1,5,"because what you hope for is kept safe for you in heaven. You first heard about this hope when you believed the true message, which is the good news."
Colossians,1,6,"The good news is spreading all over the world with great success. It has spread in that same way among you, ever since the first day you learnt the truth about God's wonderful kindness"
Colossians,1,7,from our good friend Epaphras. He works together with us for Christ and is a faithful worker for you.
Colossians,1,8,He is also the one who told us about the love that God's Spirit has given you.
Colossians,1,9,"We have not stopped praying for you since the first day we heard about you. In fact, we always pray that God will show you everything he wants you to do and that you may have all the wisdom and understanding that his Spirit gives."
Colossians,1,10,"Then you will live a life that honours the Lord, and you will always please him by doing good deeds. You will come to know God even better."
Colossians,1,11,"His glorious power will make you patient and strong enough to endure anything, and you will be truly happy."
Colossians,1,12,I pray that you will be grateful to God for letting you have part in what he has promised his people in the kingdom of light.
Colossians,1,13,"God rescued us from the dark power of Satan and brought us into the kingdom of his dear Son,"
Colossians,1,14,who forgives our sins and sets us free.
Colossians,1,15,"Christ is exactly like God, who cannot be seen. He is the firstborn Son, superior to all creation."
Colossians,1,16,"Everything was created by him, everything in heaven and on earth, everything seen and unseen, including all forces and powers, and all rulers and authorities. All things were created by God's Son, and everything was made for him."
Colossians,1,17,"God's Son was before all else, and by him everything is held together."
Colossians,1,18,"He is the head of his body, which is the church. He is the very beginning, the first to be raised from death, so that he would be above all others."
Colossians,1,19,God himself was pleased to live fully in his Son.
Colossians,1,20,"And God was pleased for him to make peace by sacrificing his blood on the cross, so that all beings in heaven and on earth would be brought back to God."
Colossians,1,21,"You used to be far from God. Your thoughts made you his enemies, and you did evil things."
Colossians,1,22,"But his Son became a human and died. So God made peace with you, and now he lets you stand in his presence as people who are holy and faultless and innocent."
Colossians,1,23,"But you must stay deeply rooted and firm in your faith. You must not give up the hope you received when you heard the good news. It was preached to everyone on earth, and I myself have become a servant of this message."
Colossians,1,24,"I am glad that I can suffer for you. I am pleased also that in my own body I can continue the suffering of Christ for his body, the church."
Colossians,1,25,God's plan was to make me a servant of his church and to send me to preach his complete message to you.
Colossians,1,26,"For many ages this message was kept secret from everyone, but now it has been explained to God's people."
Colossians,1,27,"God did this because he wanted you Gentiles to understand his wonderful and glorious mystery. And the mystery is that Christ lives in you, and he is your hope of sharing in God's glory."
Colossians,1,28,"We announce the message about Christ, and we use all our wisdom to warn and teach everyone, so that all Christ's followers will grow and become mature."
Colossians,1,29,That's why I work so hard and use the mighty power he gives me.
Colossians,2,1,"I want you to know what a struggle I am going through for you, for God's people at Laodicea, and for all those followers who have never met me."
Colossians,2,2,"I do it to encourage them. Then as their hearts are joined together in love, they will be wonderfully blessed with complete understanding. And they will truly know Christ. Not only is he the key to God's mystery,"
Colossians,2,3,but all wisdom and knowledge are hidden away in him.
Colossians,2,4,I tell you these things to keep you from being fooled by fancy talk.
Colossians,2,5,"Even though I am not with you, I keep thinking about you. I am glad to know that you are living as you should and that your faith in Christ is strong."
Colossians,2,6,You have accepted Christ Jesus as your Lord. Now keep on following him.
Colossians,2,7,"Plant your roots in Christ and let him be the foundation for your life. Be strong in your faith, just as you were taught. And be grateful."
Colossians,2,8,"Don't let anyone fool you by using senseless arguments. These arguments may sound wise, but they are only human teachings. They come from the powers of this world and not from Christ."
Colossians,2,9,God lives fully in Christ.
Colossians,2,10,"And you are fully grown because you belong to Christ, who is over every power and authority."
Colossians,2,11,"Christ has also taken away your selfish desires, just as circumcision removes flesh from the body."
Colossians,2,12,"And when you were baptized, it was the same as being buried with Christ. Then you were raised to life because you had faith in the power of God, who raised Christ from death."
Colossians,2,13,"You were dead, because you were sinful and were not God's people. But God let Christ make you alive, when he forgave all our sins."
Colossians,2,14,God wiped out the charges that were against us for disobeying the Law of Moses. He took them away and nailed them to the cross.
Colossians,2,15,There Christ defeated all powers and forces. He let the whole world see them being led away as prisoners when he celebrated his victory.
Colossians,2,16,"Don't let anyone tell you what you must eat or drink. Don't let them say that you must celebrate the New Moon festival, the Sabbath, or any other festival."
Colossians,2,17,These things are only a shadow of what was to come. But Christ is real!
Colossians,2,18,"Don't be cheated by people who make a show of acting humble and who worship angels. They boast about seeing visions. But it is all nonsense, because their minds are filled with selfish desires."
Colossians,2,19,"They are no longer part of Christ, who is the head of the whole body. Christ gives the body its strength, and he uses its joints and muscles to hold it together, as it grows by the power of God."
Colossians,2,20,"You died with Christ. Now the forces of the universe don't have any power over you. Why do you live as if you had to obey such rules as,"
Colossians,2,21,“Don't handle this. Don't taste that. Don't touch this.”?
Colossians,2,22,"After these things are used, they are no longer good for anything. So why be bothered with the rules that humans have made up?"
Colossians,2,23,Obeying these rules may seem to be the clever thing to do. They appear to make you love God more and to be very humble and to have control over your body. But they don't really have any power over our desires.
Colossians,3,1,"You have been raised to life with Christ. Now set your heart on what is in heaven, where Christ rules at God's right side."
Colossians,3,2,"Think about what is up there, not about what is here on earth."
Colossians,3,3,"You died, which means that your life is hidden with Christ, who sits beside God."
Colossians,3,4,"Christ gives meaning to your life, and when he appears, you will also appear with him in glory."
Colossians,3,5,"Don't be controlled by your body. Kill every desire for the wrong kind of sex. Don't be immoral or indecent or have evil thoughts. Don't be greedy, which is the same as worshipping idols."
Colossians,3,6,God is angry with people who disobey him by doing these things.
Colossians,3,7,"And that is exactly what you did, when you lived among people who behaved in this way."
Colossians,3,8,"But now you must stop doing such things. You must stop being angry, hateful, and evil. You must no longer say insulting or cruel things about others."
Colossians,3,9,And stop lying to each other. You have given up your old way of life with its habits.
Colossians,3,10,"Each of you is now a new person. You are becoming more and more like your Creator, and you will understand him better."
Colossians,3,11,"It doesn't matter if you are a Greek or a Jew, or if you are circumcised or not. You may even be a barbarian or a Scythian, and you may be a slave or a free person. Yet Christ is all that matters, and he lives in all of us."
Colossians,3,12,"God loves you and has chosen you as his own special people. So be gentle, kind, humble, meek, and patient."
Colossians,3,13,"Put up with each other, and forgive anyone who does you wrong, just as Christ has forgiven you."
Colossians,3,14,Love is more important than anything else. It is what ties everything completely together.
Colossians,3,15,"Each one of you is part of the body of Christ, and you were chosen to live together in peace. So let the peace that comes from Christ control your thoughts. And be grateful."
Colossians,3,16,"Let the message about Christ completely fill your lives, while you use all your wisdom to teach and instruct each other. With thankful hearts, sing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs to God."
Colossians,3,17,"Whatever you say or do should be done in the name of the Lord Jesus, as you give thanks to God the Father because of him."
Colossians,3,18,A wife must put her husband first. This is her duty as a follower of the Lord.
Colossians,3,19,A husband must love his wife and not abuse her.
Colossians,3,20,Children must always obey their parents. This pleases the Lord.
Colossians,3,21,"Parents, don't be hard on your children. If you are, they might give up."
Colossians,3,22,"Slaves, you must always obey your earthly masters. Try to please them at all times, and not just when you think they are watching. Honour the Lord and serve your masters with your whole heart."
Colossians,3,23,"Do your work willingly, as though you were serving the Lord himself, and not just your earthly master."
Colossians,3,24,"In fact, the Lord Christ is the one you are really serving, and you know that he will reward you."
Colossians,3,25,"But Christ has no favourites! He will punish evil people, just as they deserve."
Colossians,4,1,"Slave owners, be fair and honest with your slaves. Don't forget that you have a Master in heaven."
Colossians,4,2,"Never give up praying. And when you pray, keep alert and be thankful."
Colossians,4,3,"Be sure to pray that God will make a way for us to spread his message and explain the mystery about Christ, even though I am in jail for doing this."
Colossians,4,4,Please pray that I will make the message as clear as possible.
Colossians,4,5,"When you are with unbelievers, always make good use of the time."
Colossians,4,6,Be pleasant and hold their interest when you speak the message. Choose your words carefully and be ready to give answers to anyone who asks questions.
Colossians,4,7,"Tychicus is the dear friend, who faithfully works and serves the Lord with us, and he will give you the news about me."
Colossians,4,8,I am sending him to cheer you up by telling you how we are getting along.
Colossians,4,9,"Onesimus, that dear and faithful follower from your own group, is coming with him. The two of them will tell you everything that has happened here."
Colossians,4,10,"Aristarchus is in jail with me. He sends greetings to you, and so does Mark, the cousin of Barnabas. You have already been told to welcome Mark, if he visits you."
Colossians,4,11,"Jesus, who is known as Justus, sends his greetings. These three men are the only Jewish followers who have worked with me for the kingdom of God. They have given me much comfort."
Colossians,4,12,"Your own Epaphras, who serves Christ Jesus, sends his greetings. He always prays hard that you may fully know what the Lord wants you to do and that you may do it completely."
Colossians,4,13,I have seen how much trouble he has gone through for you and for the followers in Laodicea and Hierapolis.
Colossians,4,14,"Our dear doctor Luke sends you his greetings, and so does Demas."
Colossians,4,15,"Give my greetings to the followers at Laodicea, especially to Nympha and the church that meets in her home."
Colossians,4,16,"After this letter has been read to your people, be sure to have it read in the church at Laodicea. And you should read the letter that I have sent to them."
Colossians,4,17,Remind Archippus to do the work that the Lord has given him to do.
Colossians,4,18,I am signing this letter myself: PAUL. Don't forget that I am in jail. I pray that God will be kind to you.
1 Thessalonians,1,1,"From Paul, Silas, and Timothy. To the church in Thessalonica, the people of God the Father and of the Lord Jesus Christ. I pray that God will be kind to you and will bless you with peace!"
1 Thessalonians,1,2,"We thank God for you and always mention you in our prayers. Each time we pray,"
1 Thessalonians,1,3,we tell God our Father about your faith and loving work and about your firm hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Thessalonians,1,4,"My dear friends, God loves you, and we know he has chosen you to be his people."
1 Thessalonians,1,5,"When we told you the good news, it was with the power and assurance that come from the Holy Spirit, and not simply with words. You knew what kind of people we were and how we helped you."
1 Thessalonians,1,6,"So, when you accepted the message, you followed our example and the example of the Lord. You suffered, but the Holy Spirit made you glad."
1 Thessalonians,1,7,You became an example for all the Lord's followers in Macedonia and Achaia.
1 Thessalonians,1,8,"And because of you, the Lord's message has spread everywhere in those regions. Now the news of your faith in God is known all over the world, and we don't have to say a thing about it."
1 Thessalonians,1,9,Everyone is talking about how you welcomed us and how you turned away from idols to serve the true and living God.
1 Thessalonians,1,10,"They also tell how you are waiting for his Son Jesus to come from heaven. God raised him from death, and on the day of judgment Jesus will save us from God's anger."
1 Thessalonians,2,1,"My friends, you know that our time with you wasn't wasted."
1 Thessalonians,2,2,"As you remember, we had been ill-treated and insulted at Philippi. But God gave us the courage to tell you the good news about him, even though many people caused us trouble."

1 Thessalonians,2,6,We were not trying to get you or anyone else to praise us.
1 Thessalonians,2,7,"But as apostles, we could have demanded help from you. After all, Christ is the one who sent us. We chose to be like children or like a mother nursing her baby."
1 Thessalonians,2,8,"We cared so much for you, and you became so dear to us, that we were willing to give our lives for you when we gave you God's message."
1 Thessalonians,2,9,"My dear friends, you haven't forgotten our hard work and hardships. You remember how night and day we struggled to make a living, so that we could tell you God's message without being a burden to anyone."
1 Thessalonians,2,10,Both you and God are witnesses that we were pure and honest and innocent in our dealings with you followers of the Lord.
1 Thessalonians,2,11,You also know we did everything for you that parents would do for their own children.
1 Thessalonians,2,12,"We begged, encouraged, and urged each of you to live in a way that would honour God. He is the one who chose you to share in his own kingdom and glory."
1 Thessalonians,2,13,"We always thank God that you believed the message we preached. It came from him, and it isn't something made up by humans. You accepted it as God's message, and now he is working in you."
1 Thessalonians,2,14,"My friends, you did just like God's churches in Judea and like the other followers of Christ Jesus there. And so, you were ill-treated by your own people, in the same way they were ill-treated by their people."
1 Thessalonians,2,15,"Those Jews killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and they even chased us away. God doesn't like what they do and neither does anyone else."
1 Thessalonians,2,16,They keep us from speaking his message to the Gentiles and from leading them to be saved. The Jews have always gone too far with their sins. Now God has finally become angry and will punish them.
1 Thessalonians,2,17,"My friends, we were kept from coming to you for a while, but we never stopped thinking about you. We were eager to see you and tried our best to visit you in person."
1 Thessalonians,2,18,"We really wanted to come. I myself tried several times, but Satan always stopped us."
1 Thessalonians,2,19,"After all, when the Lord Jesus appears, who else but you will give us hope and joy and be like a glorious crown for us?"
1 Thessalonians,2,20,You alone are our glory and joy!
1 Thessalonians,3,1,"Finally, we couldn't stand it any longer. We decided to stay in Athens by ourselves"
1 Thessalonians,3,2,and send our friend Timothy to you. He works with us as God's servant and preaches the good news about Christ. We wanted him to make you strong in your faith and to encourage you.
1 Thessalonians,3,3,"We didn't want any of you to be discouraged by all these troubles. You knew we would have to suffer,"
1 Thessalonians,3,4,"because when we were with you, we told you this would happen. And we did suffer, as you well know."
1 Thessalonians,3,5,"At last, when I could not wait any longer, I sent Timothy to find out about your faith. I hoped that Satan had not tempted you and made all our work useless."
1 Thessalonians,3,6,Timothy has come back from his visit to you and has told us about your faith and love. He also said that you always have happy memories of us and that you want to see us as much as we want to see you.
1 Thessalonians,3,7,"My friends, even though we have a lot of trouble and suffering, your faith makes us feel better about you."
1 Thessalonians,3,8,Your strong faith in the Lord is like a breath of new life.
1 Thessalonians,3,9,How can we possibly thank God enough for all the happiness you have brought us?
1 Thessalonians,3,10,Day and night we sincerely pray that we will see you again and help you to have an even stronger faith.
1 Thessalonians,3,11,We pray that God our Father and our Lord Jesus will let us visit you.
1 Thessalonians,3,12,May the Lord make your love for each other and for everyone else grow by leaps and bounds. That's how our love for you has grown.
1 Thessalonians,3,13,"And when our Lord comes with all his people, I pray that he will make your hearts pure and innocent in the sight of God the Father."
1 Thessalonians,4,1,"Finally, my dear friends, since you belong to the Lord Jesus, we beg and urge you to live as we taught you. Then you will please God. You are already living that way, but try even harder."
1 Thessalonians,4,2,Remember the instructions we gave you as followers of the Lord Jesus.
1 Thessalonians,4,3,"God wants you to be holy, so don't be immoral in matters of sex."
1 Thessalonians,4,4,Respect and honour your wife.
1 Thessalonians,4,5,Don't be a slave of your desires or live like people who don't know God.
1 Thessalonians,4,6,"You must not cheat any of the Lord's followers in matters of sex. Remember, we warned you that he punishes everyone who does such things."
1 Thessalonians,4,7,"God didn't choose you to be filthy, but to be pure."
1 Thessalonians,4,8,"So if you don't obey these rules, you are not really disobeying us. You are disobeying God, who gives you his Holy Spirit."
1 Thessalonians,4,9,"We don't have to write to you about the need to love each other. God has taught you to do this,"
1 Thessalonians,4,10,"and you already have shown your love for all his people in Macedonia. But, my dear friends, we ask you to do even more."
1 Thessalonians,4,11,"Try your best to live quietly, to mind your own business, and to work hard, just as we taught you to do."
1 Thessalonians,4,12,"Then you will be respected by people who are not followers of the Lord, and you won't have to depend on anyone."
1 Thessalonians,4,13,"My friends, we want you to understand how it will be for those followers who have already died. Then you won't grieve over them and be like people who don't have any hope."
1 Thessalonians,4,14,"We believe that Jesus died and was raised to life. We also believe that when God brings Jesus back again, he will bring with him all who had faith in Jesus before they died."
1 Thessalonians,4,15,"Our Lord Jesus told us that when he comes, we won't go up to meet him ahead of his followers who have already died."
1 Thessalonians,4,16,"With a loud command and with the shout of the chief angel and a blast of God's trumpet, the Lord will return from heaven. Then those who had faith in Christ before they died will be raised to life."
1 Thessalonians,4,17,"Next, all of us who are still alive will be taken up into the clouds together with them to meet the Lord in the sky. From that time on we will all be with the Lord for ever."
1 Thessalonians,4,18,Encourage each other with these words.
1 Thessalonians,5,1,I don't need to write to you about the time or date when all this will happen.
1 Thessalonians,5,2,You know that the Lord's return will be as a thief coming at night.
1 Thessalonians,5,3,People will think they are safe and secure. But destruction will suddenly strike them like the pains of a woman about to give birth. And they won't escape.
1 Thessalonians,5,4,"My dear friends, you don't live in darkness, and so that day won't surprise you like a thief."
1 Thessalonians,5,5,You belong to the light and live in the day. We don't live in the night or belong to the dark.
1 Thessalonians,5,6,"Others may sleep, but we should stay awake and be alert."
1 Thessalonians,5,7,"People sleep during the night, and some even get drunk."
1 Thessalonians,5,8,But we belong to the day. So we must stay sober and let our faith and love be like a suit of armour. Our firm hope that we will be saved is our helmet.
1 Thessalonians,5,9,"God doesn't intend to punish us, but wants us to be saved by our Lord Jesus Christ."
1 Thessalonians,5,10,"Christ died for us, so that we could live with him, whether we are alive or dead when he comes."
1 Thessalonians,5,11,"That's why you must encourage and help each other, just as you are already doing."
1 Thessalonians,5,12,"My friends, we ask you to be thoughtful of your leaders who work hard and tell you how to live for the Lord."
1 Thessalonians,5,13,Show them great respect and love because of their work. Try to get along with each other.
1 Thessalonians,5,14,"My friends, we beg you to warn anyone who isn't living right. Encourage anyone who feels left out, help all who are weak, and be patient with everyone."
1 Thessalonians,5,15,"Don't be hateful to people, just because they are hateful to you. Rather, be good to each other and to everyone else."
1 Thessalonians,5,16,Always be joyful
1 Thessalonians,5,17,and never stop praying.
1 Thessalonians,5,18,"Whatever happens, keep thanking God because of Jesus Christ. This is what God wants you to do."
1 Thessalonians,5,19,Don't turn away God's Spirit
1 Thessalonians,5,20,or ignore prophecies.
1 Thessalonians,5,21,Put everything to the test. Accept what is good
1 Thessalonians,5,22,and don't have anything to do with evil.
1 Thessalonians,5,23,"I pray that God, who gives peace, will make you completely holy. And may your spirit, soul, and body be kept healthy and faultless until our Lord Jesus Christ returns."
1 Thessalonians,5,24,"The one who chose you can be trusted, and he will do this."
1 Thessalonians,5,25,"Friends, please pray for us."
1 Thessalonians,5,26,Give the Lord's followers a warm greeting.
1 Thessalonians,5,27,In the name of the Lord I beg you to read this letter to all his followers.
1 Thessalonians,5,28,I pray that our Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you!
2 Thessalonians,1,1,"From Paul, Silas, and Timothy. To the church in Thessalonica, the people of God our Father and of the Lord Jesus Christ."
2 Thessalonians,1,2,I pray that God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you and will bless you with peace!
2 Thessalonians,1,3,"My dear friends, we always have good reason to thank God for you, because your faith in God and your love for each other keep growing all the time."
2 Thessalonians,1,4,"That's why we boast about you to all God's churches. We tell them how patient you are and how you keep on having faith, even though you are going through a lot of trouble and suffering."
2 Thessalonians,1,5,All this shows that God judges fairly and that he is making you fit to share in his kingdom for which you are suffering.
2 Thessalonians,1,6,"It is only right for God to punish everyone who is causing you trouble,"
2 Thessalonians,1,7,"but he will give you relief from your troubles. He will do the same for us, when the Lord Jesus comes from heaven with his powerful angels"
2 Thessalonians,1,8,and with a flaming fire. Our Lord Jesus will punish anyone who doesn't know God and won't obey his message.
2 Thessalonians,1,9,"Their punishment will be eternal destruction, and they will be kept far from the presence of our Lord and his glorious strength."
2 Thessalonians,1,10,"This will happen on that day when the Lord returns to be praised and honoured by all who have faith in him and belong to him. This includes you, because you believed what we said."
2 Thessalonians,1,11,"God chose you, and we keep praying that God will make you worthy of being his people. We pray for God's power to help you do all the good things that you hope to do and that your faith makes you want to do."
2 Thessalonians,1,12,"Then, because God and our Lord Jesus Christ are so kind, you will bring honour to the name of our Lord Jesus, and he will bring honour to you."
2 Thessalonians,2,1,"When our Lord Jesus returns, we will be gathered up to meet him. So I ask you, my friends,"
2 Thessalonians,2,2,"not to be easily upset or disturbed by people who claim that the Lord has already come. They may say that they heard this directly from the Holy Spirit, or from someone else, or even that they read it in one of our letters."
2 Thessalonians,2,3,"But don't be fooled! People will rebel against God. Then before the Lord returns, the wicked one who is doomed to be destroyed will appear."
2 Thessalonians,2,4,He will boast and oppose everything that is holy or sacred. He will even sit in God's temple and claim to be God.
2 Thessalonians,2,5,Don't you remember that I told you this while I was still with you?
2 Thessalonians,2,6,You already know what is holding this wicked one back until it is time for him to come.
2 Thessalonians,2,7,"His mysterious power is already at work, but someone is holding him back. And the wicked one won't appear until that someone is out of the way."
2 Thessalonians,2,8,"Then he will appear, but the Lord Jesus will kill him simply by breathing on him. He will be completely destroyed by the Lord's glorious return."
2 Thessalonians,2,9,"When the wicked one appears, Satan will pretend to perform all kinds of miracles, wonders, and signs."
2 Thessalonians,2,10,"Lost people will be fooled by his evil deeds. They could be saved, but they will refuse to love the truth and accept it."
2 Thessalonians,2,11,So God will make sure that they are fooled into believing a lie.
2 Thessalonians,2,12,"All of them will be punished, because they would rather do evil than believe the truth."
2 Thessalonians,2,13,"My friends, the Lord loves you, and it is only natural for us to thank God for you. God chose you to be the first ones to be saved. His Spirit made you holy, and you put your faith in the truth."
2 Thessalonians,2,14,God used our preaching as his way of inviting you to share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Thessalonians,2,15,"My friends, that's why you must remain faithful and follow closely what we taught you in person and by our letters."
2 Thessalonians,2,16,God our Father loves us. He is kind and has given us eternal comfort and a wonderful hope. We pray that our Lord Jesus Christ and God our Father
2 Thessalonians,2,17,will encourage you and help you always to do and say the right thing.
2 Thessalonians,3,1,"Finally, our friends, please pray for us. This will help the message about the Lord to spread quickly, and others will respect it, just as you do."
2 Thessalonians,3,2,"Pray that we may be kept safe from worthless and evil people. After all, not everyone has faith."
2 Thessalonians,3,3,But the Lord can be trusted to make you strong and protect you from harm.
2 Thessalonians,3,4,He has made us sure that you are obeying what we taught you and that you will keep on obeying.
2 Thessalonians,3,5,I pray that the Lord will guide you to be as loving as God and as patient as Christ.
2 Thessalonians,3,6,"My dear friends, in the name of the Lord Jesus, I beg you not to have anything to do with any of your people who waste their time and refuse to obey the instructions we gave you."
2 Thessalonians,3,7,"You know that you should follow our example. We didn't waste our time being lazy,"
2 Thessalonians,3,8,"and we didn't accept food from anyone without paying for it. We didn't want to be a burden to any of you, so night and day we worked as hard as we could."
2 Thessalonians,3,9,"We had the right not to work, but we wanted to set an example for you."
2 Thessalonians,3,10,"We also gave you the rule that if you don't work, you don't eat."
2 Thessalonians,3,11,"Now we learn that some of you waste your time and won't do any work, except the work of a busybody."
2 Thessalonians,3,12,"So, for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ, we ask and beg these people to settle down and start working for a living."
2 Thessalonians,3,13,"Dear friends, you must never become tired of doing right."
2 Thessalonians,3,14,Be on your guard against any followers who refuse to obey what we have written in this letter. Put them to shame by not having anything to do with them.
2 Thessalonians,3,15,"Don't consider them your enemies, but speak kindly to them as you would to any other follower."
2 Thessalonians,3,16,"I pray that the Lord, who gives peace, will always bless you with peace. May the Lord be with all of you."
2 Thessalonians,3,17,I always sign my letters as I am now doing: PAUL.
2 Thessalonians,3,18,I pray that our Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to all of you.
1 Timothy,1,1,"From Paul. God our Saviour and Christ Jesus commanded me to be an apostle of Christ Jesus, who gives us hope."
1 Timothy,1,2,"Timothy, because of our faith, you are like a son to me. I pray that God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ will be kind and merciful to you. May they bless you with peace!"
1 Timothy,1,3,"When I was leaving for Macedonia, I asked you to stay on in Ephesus and warn certain people there to stop spreading their false teachings."
1 Timothy,1,4,You needed to warn them to stop wasting their time on senseless stories and endless lists of ancestors. Such things only cause arguments. They don't help anyone to do God's work that can only be done by faith.
1 Timothy,1,5,"You must teach people to have genuine love, as well as a good conscience and true faith."
1 Timothy,1,6,There are some who have given up these for nothing but empty talk.
1 Timothy,1,7,"They want to be teachers of the Law of Moses. But they don't know what they are talking about, even though they think they do."
1 Timothy,1,8,"We know that the Law is good, if it is used in the right way."
1 Timothy,1,9,"We also understand that it wasn't given to control people who please God, but to control lawbreakers, criminals, godless people, and sinners. It is for wicked and evil people, and for murderers, who would even kill their own parents."
1 Timothy,1,10,The Law was written for people who are sexual perverts or who live as homosexuals or are kidnappers or liars or won't tell the truth in court. It is for anything else that opposes the correct teaching
1 Timothy,1,11,of the good news that the glorious and wonderful God has given me.
1 Timothy,1,12,I thank Christ Jesus our Lord. He has given me the strength for my work because he knew that he could trust me.
1 Timothy,1,13,"I used to say terrible and insulting things about him, and I was cruel. But he had mercy on me because I didn't know what I was doing, and I had not yet put my faith in him."
1 Timothy,1,14,Christ Jesus our Lord was very kind to me. He has greatly blessed my life with faith and love just like his own.
1 Timothy,1,15,"“Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.” This saying is true, and it can be trusted. I was the worst sinner of all!"
1 Timothy,1,16,"But since I was worse than anyone else, God had mercy on me and let me be an example of the endless patience of Christ Jesus. He did this so that others would put their faith in Christ and have eternal life."
1 Timothy,1,17,"I pray that honour and glory will always be given to the only God, who lives for ever and is the invisible and eternal King! Amen."
1 Timothy,1,18,"Timothy, my son, the instructions I am giving you are based on what some prophets once said about you. If you follow these instructions, you will fight like a good soldier."
1 Timothy,1,19,You will be faithful and have a clear conscience. Some people have made a mess of their faith because they didn't listen to their consciences.
1 Timothy,1,20,"Two of them are Hymenaeus and Alexander. I have given these men over to the power of Satan, so they will learn not to oppose God."
1 Timothy,2,1,"First of all, I ask you to pray for everyone. Ask God to help and bless them all, and tell God how thankful you are for each of them."
1 Timothy,2,2,"Pray for kings and others in power, so that we may live quiet and peaceful lives as we worship and honour God."
1 Timothy,2,3,"This kind of prayer is good, and it pleases God our Saviour."
1 Timothy,2,4,"God wants everyone to be saved and to know the whole truth, which is,"
1 Timothy,2,5,"There is only one God, and Christ Jesus is the only one who can bring us to God. Jesus was truly human, and he gave himself to rescue all of us."
1 Timothy,2,6,God showed us this at the right time.
1 Timothy,2,7,This is why God chose me to be a preacher and an apostle of the good news. I am telling the truth. I am not lying. God sent me to teach the Gentiles about faith and truth.
1 Timothy,2,8,"I want everyone everywhere to lift innocent hands towards heaven and pray, without being angry or arguing with each other."
1 Timothy,2,9,"I would like women to wear modest and sensible clothes. They should not have fancy hair styles, or wear expensive clothes, or put on jewellery made of gold or pearls."
1 Timothy,2,10,"Women who claim to love God should do helpful things for others,"
1 Timothy,2,11,and they should learn by being quiet and paying attention.
1 Timothy,2,12,They should be silent and not be allowed to teach or to tell men what to do.
1 Timothy,2,13,"After all, Adam was created before Eve,"
1 Timothy,2,14,and the man Adam wasn't the one who was fooled. It was the woman Eve who was completely fooled and sinned.
1 Timothy,2,15,"But women will be saved by having children, if they stay faithful, loving, holy, and modest."
1 Timothy,3,1,It is true that anyone who desires to be a church official wants to be something worthwhile.
1 Timothy,3,2,"That's why officials must have a good reputation and be faithful in marriage. They must be self-controlled, sensible, well-behaved, friendly to strangers, and able to teach."
1 Timothy,3,3,"They must not be heavy drinkers or troublemakers. Instead, they must be kind and gentle and not love money."
1 Timothy,3,4,"Church officials must be in control of their own families, and they must see that their children are obedient and always respectful."
1 Timothy,3,5,"If they don't know how to control their own families, how can they look after God's people?"
1 Timothy,3,6,"They must not be new followers of the Lord. If they are, they might become proud and be doomed along with the devil."
1 Timothy,3,7,"Finally, they must be well respected by people who are not followers. Then they won't be trapped and disgraced by the devil."
1 Timothy,3,8,"Church officers should be serious. They must not be liars, heavy drinkers, or greedy for money."
1 Timothy,3,9,And they must have a clear conscience and hold firmly to what God has shown us about our faith.
1 Timothy,3,10,"They must first prove themselves. Then if no one has anything against them, they can serve as officers."
1 Timothy,3,11,"Women must also be serious. They must not gossip or be heavy drinkers, and they must be faithful in everything they do."
1 Timothy,3,12,Church officers must be faithful in marriage. They must be in full control of their children and everyone else in their home.
1 Timothy,3,13,Those who serve well as officers will earn a good reputation and will be highly respected for their faith in Christ Jesus.
1 Timothy,3,14,"I hope to visit you soon. But I am writing these instructions,"
1 Timothy,3,15,"so that if I am delayed, you will know how everyone who belongs to God's family ought to behave. After all, the church of the living God is the strong foundation of truth."
1 Timothy,3,16,"Here is the great mystery of our religion: Christ came as a human. The Spirit proved that he pleased God, and he was seen by angels. Christ was preached to the nations. People in this world put their faith in him, and he was taken up to glory."
1 Timothy,4,1,God's Spirit clearly says that in the last days many people will turn from their faith. They will be fooled by evil spirits and by teachings that come from demons.
1 Timothy,4,2,They will also be fooled by the false claims of liars whose consciences have lost all feeling. These liars
1 Timothy,4,3,will forbid people to marry or to eat certain foods. But God created these foods to be eaten with thankful hearts by his followers who know the truth.
1 Timothy,4,4,"Everything God created is good. And if you give thanks, you may eat anything."
1 Timothy,4,5,What God has said and your prayer will make it fit to eat.
1 Timothy,4,6,"If you teach these things to other followers, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus. You will show that you have grown up on the teachings about our faith and on the good instructions you have obeyed."
1 Timothy,4,7,"Don't have anything to do with worthless, senseless stories. Work hard to be truly religious."
1 Timothy,5,1,"Don't correct an older man. Encourage him, as you would your own father. Treat younger men as you would your own brother,"
1 Timothy,5,2,and treat older women as you would your own mother. Show the same respect to younger women that you would to your sister.
1 Timothy,5,3,Take care of any widow who is really in need.
1 Timothy,5,4,"But if a widow has children or grandchildren, they should learn to serve God by taking care of her, as she once took care of them. This is what God wants them to do."
1 Timothy,5,5,"A widow who is really in need is one who doesn't have any relatives. She has faith in God, and she keeps praying to him night and day, asking for his help."
1 Timothy,5,6,"A widow who thinks only about having a good time is already dead, even though she is still alive."
1 Timothy,5,7,"Tell all this to everyone, so they will do the right thing."
1 Timothy,5,8,"People who don't take care of their relatives, and especially their own families, have given up their faith. They are worse than someone who doesn't have faith in the Lord."
1 Timothy,5,9,"For a widow to be put on the list of widows, she must be at least sixty years old, and she must have been faithful in marriage."
1 Timothy,5,10,"She must also be well known for doing all sorts of good things, such as raising children, giving food to strangers, welcoming God's people into her home, helping people in need, and always making herself useful."
1 Timothy,5,11,Don't put young widows on the list. They may later have a strong desire to get married. Then they will turn away from Christ
1 Timothy,5,12,and become guilty of breaking their promise to him.
1 Timothy,5,13,"Besides, they will become lazy and get into the habit of going from house to house. Next, they will start gossiping and become busybodies, talking about things that are none of their business."
1 Timothy,5,14,"I would prefer that young widows get married, have children, and look after their families. Then the enemy won't have any reason to say insulting things about us."
1 Timothy,5,15,Look what's already happened to some of the young widows! They have turned away to follow Satan.
1 Timothy,5,16,"If a woman who is a follower has any widows in her family, she should help them. This will keep the church from having that burden, and then the church can help widows who are really in need."
1 Timothy,5,17,"Church leaders who do their job well deserve to be paid twice as much, especially if they work hard at preaching and teaching."
1 Timothy,5,18,"It is just as the Scriptures say, “Don't muzzle an ox when you are using it to grind grain.” You also know the saying, “Workers are worth their pay.”"
1 Timothy,5,19,"Don't listen to any charge against a church leader, unless at least two or three people bring the same charges."
1 Timothy,5,20,"But if any of the leaders should keep on sinning, they must be corrected in front of the whole group, as a warning to everyone else."
1 Timothy,5,21,"In the presence of God and Christ Jesus and their chosen angels, I order you to follow my instructions! Be fair with everyone, and don't have any favourites."
1 Timothy,5,22,"Don't be too quick to accept people into the service of the Lord by placing your hands on them. Don't sin because others do, but stay close to God."
1 Timothy,5,23,Stop drinking only water. Take a little wine to help your stomach trouble and the other illnesses you always have.
1 Timothy,5,24,"Some people get caught in their sins straight away, even before the time of judgment. But other people's sins don't show up until later."
1 Timothy,5,25,"It is the same with good deeds. Some are easily seen, but none of them can be hidden."
1 Timothy,6,1,"If you are a slave, you should respect and honour your owner. This will keep people from saying bad things about God and about our teaching."
1 Timothy,6,2,"If any of you slaves have owners who are followers, you should show them respect. After all, they are also followers of Christ, and he loves them. So you should serve and help them the best you can. These are the things you must teach and tell the people to do."
1 Timothy,6,3,Anyone who teaches something different disagrees with the correct and godly teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Timothy,6,4,"Those people who disagree are proud of themselves, but they don't really know a thing. Their minds are sick, and they like to argue over words. They cause jealousy, disagreements, unkind words, evil suspicions,"
1 Timothy,6,5,and nasty quarrels. They have wicked minds and have missed out on the truth. These people think religion is supposed to make you rich.
1 Timothy,6,6,"And religion does make your life rich, by making you content with what you have."
1 Timothy,6,7,"We didn't bring anything into this world, and we won't take anything with us when we leave."
1 Timothy,6,8,So we should be satisfied just to have food and clothes.
1 Timothy,6,9,People who want to be rich fall into all sorts of temptations and traps. They are caught by foolish and harmful desires that drag them down and destroy them.
1 Timothy,6,10,The love of money causes all kinds of trouble. Some people want money so much that they have given up their faith and caused themselves a lot of pain.
1 Timothy,6,11,"Timothy, you belong to God, so keep away from all these evil things. Try your best to please God and to be like him. Be faithful, loving, dependable, and gentle."
1 Timothy,6,12,"Fight a good fight for the faith and claim eternal life. God offered it to you when you clearly told about your faith, while so many people listened."
1 Timothy,6,13,"Now I ask you to make a promise. Make it in the presence of God, who gives life to all, and in the presence of Jesus Christ, who openly told Pontius Pilate about his faith."
1 Timothy,6,14,Promise to obey completely and fully all that you have been told until our Lord Jesus Christ returns.
1 Timothy,6,15,"The glorious God is the only Ruler, the King of kings and Lord of lords. At the time that God has already decided, he will send Jesus Christ back again."
1 Timothy,6,16,"Only God lives for ever! And he lives in light that no one can come near. No human has ever seen God or ever can see him. God will be honoured, and his power will last for ever. Amen."
1 Timothy,6,17,"Warn the rich people of this world not to be proud or to trust in wealth that is easily lost. Tell them to have faith in God, who is rich and blesses us with everything we need to enjoy life."
1 Timothy,6,18,Instruct them to do as many good deeds as they can and to help everyone. Remind the rich to be generous and share what they have.
1 Timothy,6,19,"This will lay a solid foundation for the future, so that they will know what true life is like."
1 Timothy,6,20,"Timothy, guard what God has placed in your care! Don't pay any attention to that godless and stupid talk that sounds clever but really isn't."
1 Timothy,6,21,Some people have even lost their faith by believing this talk. I pray that the Lord will be kind to all of you!
2 Timothy,1,1,"From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus. God himself chose me to be an apostle, and he gave me the promised life that Jesus Christ makes possible."
2 Timothy,1,2,"Timothy, you are like a dear child to me. I pray that God our Father and our Lord Christ Jesus will be kind and merciful to you and will bless you with peace!"
2 Timothy,1,3,"Night and day I mention you in my prayers. I am always grateful for you, as I pray to the God my ancestors and I have served with a clear conscience."
2 Timothy,1,4,"I remember how you cried, and I want to see you, because that will make me truly happy."
2 Timothy,1,5,"I also remember the genuine faith of your mother Eunice. Your grandmother Lois had the same sort of faith, and I am sure that you have it as well."
2 Timothy,1,6,So I ask you to make full use of the gift that God gave you when I placed my hands on you. Use it well.
2 Timothy,1,7,"God's Spirit doesn't make cowards out of us. The Spirit gives us power, love, and self-control."
2 Timothy,1,8,"Don't be ashamed to speak for our Lord. And don't be ashamed of me, just because I am in jail for serving him. Use the power that comes from God and join with me in suffering for telling the good news."
2 Timothy,1,9,"God saved us and chose us to be his holy people. We did nothing to deserve this, but God planned it because he is so kind. Even before time began God planned for Christ Jesus to show kindness to us."
2 Timothy,1,10,Now Christ Jesus has come to show us the kindness of God. Christ our Saviour defeated death and brought us the good news. It shines like a light and offers life that never ends.
2 Timothy,1,11,"My work is to be a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher."
2 Timothy,1,12,"That's why I am suffering now. But I am not ashamed! I know the one I have faith in, and I am sure that he can guard until the last day what he has trusted me with."
2 Timothy,1,13,"Now follow the example of the correct teaching I gave you, and let the faith and love of Christ Jesus be your model."
2 Timothy,1,14,"You have been trusted with a wonderful treasure. Guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit, who lives within you."
2 Timothy,1,15,"You know that everyone in Asia has turned against me, especially Phygelus and Hermogenes."
2 Timothy,1,16,I pray that the Lord will be kind to the family of Onesiphorus. He often cheered me up and wasn't ashamed of me when I was put in jail.
2 Timothy,1,17,"Then after he arrived in Rome, he searched everywhere until he found me."
2 Timothy,1,18,I pray that the Lord Jesus will ask God to show mercy to Onesiphorus on the day of judgment. You know how much he helped me in Ephesus.
2 Timothy,2,1,"Timothy, my child, Christ Jesus is kind, and you must let him make you strong."
2 Timothy,2,2,You have often heard me teach. Now I want you to tell these same things to followers who can be trusted to tell others.
2 Timothy,2,3,As a good soldier of Christ Jesus you must endure your share of suffering.
2 Timothy,2,4,Soldiers on duty don't work at outside jobs. They try only to please their commanding officer.
2 Timothy,2,5,No one wins an athletic contest without obeying the rules.
2 Timothy,2,6,And farmers who work hard are the first to eat what grows in their field.
2 Timothy,2,7,"If you keep in mind what I have told you, the Lord will help you understand completely."
2 Timothy,2,8,"Keep your mind on Jesus Christ! He was from the family of David and was raised from death, just as my good news says."
2 Timothy,2,9,"And because of this message, I am locked up in jail and treated like a criminal. But God's good news isn't locked in jail,"
2 Timothy,2,10,and so I am willing to put up with anything. Then God's special people will be saved. They will be given eternal glory because they belong to Christ Jesus.
2 Timothy,2,11,"Here is a true message: “If we died with Christ, we will live with him."
2 Timothy,2,12,"If we don't give up, we will rule with him. If we deny that we know him, he will deny that he knows us."
2 Timothy,2,13,"If we are not faithful, he will still be faithful. Christ cannot deny who he is.”"
2 Timothy,2,14,"Don't let anyone forget these things. And with God as your witness, you must warn them not to argue about words. These arguments don't help anyone. In fact, they ruin everyone who listens to them."
2 Timothy,2,15,Do your best to win God's approval as a worker who doesn't need to be ashamed and who teaches only the true message.
2 Timothy,2,16,Keep away from worthless and useless talk. It only leads people further away from God.
2 Timothy,2,17,That sort of talk is like a sore that won't heal. And Hymenaeus and Philetus have been talking this way
2 Timothy,2,18,"by teaching that the dead have already been raised to life. This is far from the truth, and it is destroying the faith of some people."
2 Timothy,2,19,"But the foundation that God has laid is solid. On it is written, “The Lord knows who his people are. So everyone who worships the Lord must turn away from evil.”"
2 Timothy,2,20,"In a large house some dishes are made of gold or silver, while others are made of wood or clay. Some of these are special, and others are not."
2 Timothy,2,21,"That's also how it is with people. The ones who stop doing evil and make themselves pure will become special. Their lives will be holy and pleasing to their Master, and they will be able to do all kinds of good deeds."
2 Timothy,2,22,"Run from temptations that capture young people. Always do the right thing. Be faithful, loving, and easy to get along with. Worship with people whose hearts are pure."
2 Timothy,2,23,"Stay away from stupid and senseless arguments. These only lead to trouble,"
2 Timothy,2,24,"and God's servants must not be troublemakers. They must be kind to everyone, and they must be good teachers and very patient."
2 Timothy,2,25,Be humble when you correct people who oppose you. Perhaps God will lead them to turn to him and learn the truth.
2 Timothy,2,26,"They have been trapped by the devil, and he makes them obey him, but God may help them escape."
2 Timothy,3,1,You can be certain that in the last days there will be some very hard times.
2 Timothy,3,2,"People will love only themselves and money. They will be proud, stuck-up, rude, and disobedient to their parents. They will also be ungrateful, godless,"
2 Timothy,3,3,"heartless, and hateful. Their words will be cruel, and they will have no self-control or pity. These people will hate everything that is good."
2 Timothy,3,4,"They will be sneaky, reckless, and puffed up with pride. Instead of loving God, they will love pleasure."
2 Timothy,3,5,"Even though they will make a show of being religious, their religion won't be real. Don't have anything to do with such people."
2 Timothy,3,6,"Some men fool whole families, just to get power over those women who are slaves of sin and are controlled by all sorts of desires."
2 Timothy,3,7,"These women always want to learn something new, but they never can discover the truth."
2 Timothy,3,8,"Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, these people are enemies of the truth. Their minds are sick, and their faith isn't real."
2 Timothy,3,9,"But they won't get very far with their foolishness. Soon everyone will know the truth about them, just as Jannes and Jambres were found out."
2 Timothy,3,10,"Timothy, you know what I teach and how I live. You know what I want to do and what I believe. You have seen how patient and loving I am, and how in the past I put up with"
2 Timothy,3,11,"trouble and suffering in the cities of Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. Yet the Lord rescued me from all those terrible troubles."
2 Timothy,3,12,Anyone who belongs to Christ Jesus and wants to live right will have trouble from others.
2 Timothy,3,13,"But evil people who pretend to be what they are not will become worse than ever, as they fool others and are fooled themselves."
2 Timothy,3,14,"Keep on being faithful to what you were taught and to what you believed. After all, you know who taught you these things."
2 Timothy,3,15,"Since childhood, you have known the Holy Scriptures that are able to make you wise enough to have faith in Christ Jesus and be saved."
2 Timothy,3,16,Everything in the Scriptures is God's Word. All of it is useful for teaching and helping people and for correcting them and showing them how to live.
2 Timothy,3,17,The Scriptures train God's servants to do all kinds of good deeds.
2 Timothy,4,1,"When Christ Jesus comes as king, he will be the judge of everyone, whether they are living or dead. So with God and Christ as witnesses, I command you"
2 Timothy,4,2,"to preach God's message. Do it willingly, even if it isn't the popular thing to do. You must correct people and point out their sins. But also cheer them up, and when you instruct them, always be patient."
2 Timothy,4,3,"The time is coming when people won't listen to good teaching. Instead, they will look for teachers who will please them by telling them only what they are itching to hear."
2 Timothy,4,4,They will turn from the truth and eagerly listen to senseless stories.
2 Timothy,4,5,But you must stay calm and be willing to suffer. You must work hard to tell the good news and to do your job well.
2 Timothy,4,6,Now the time has come for me to die. My life is like a drink offering being poured out on the altar.
2 Timothy,4,7,"I have fought well. I have finished the race, and I have been faithful."
2 Timothy,4,8,"So a crown will be given to me for pleasing the Lord. He judges fairly, and on the day of judgment he will give a crown to me and to everyone else who wants him to appear with power."
2 Timothy,4,9,Come to see me as soon as you can.
2 Timothy,4,10,"Demas loves the things of this world so much that he left me and went to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus has gone to Dalmatia."
2 Timothy,4,11,"Only Luke has stayed with me. Mark can be very helpful to me, so please find him and bring him with you."
2 Timothy,4,12,I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.
2 Timothy,4,13,"When you come, bring the coat I left at Troas with Carpus. Don't forget to bring the scrolls, especially the ones made of leather."
2 Timothy,4,14,"Alexander, the metalworker, has hurt me in many ways. But the Lord will pay him back for what he has done."
2 Timothy,4,15,Alexander opposes what we preach. You had better watch out for him.
2 Timothy,4,16,"When I was first put on trial, no one helped me. In fact, everyone deserted me. I hope it won't be held against them."
2 Timothy,4,17,"But the Lord stood beside me. He gave me the strength to tell his full message, so that all Gentiles would hear it. And I was kept safe from hungry lions."
2 Timothy,4,18,"The Lord will always keep me from being harmed by evil, and he will bring me safely into his heavenly kingdom. Praise him for ever and ever! Amen."
2 Timothy,4,19,Give my greetings to Priscilla and Aquila and to the family of Onesiphorus.
2 Timothy,4,20,Erastus stayed at Corinth. Trophimus was sick when I left him at Miletus.
2 Timothy,4,21,"Do your best to come before winter. Eubulus, Pudens, Linus, and Claudia send you their greetings, and so do the rest of the Lord's followers."
2 Timothy,4,22,I pray that the Lord will bless your life and will be kind to you.
Titus,1,1,"From Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ. I encourage God's own people to have more faith and to understand the truth about religion."
Titus,1,2,Then they will have the hope of eternal life that God promised long ago. And God never tells a lie!
Titus,1,3,"So, at the proper time, God our Saviour gave this message and told me to announce what he had said."
Titus,1,4,"Titus, because of our faith, you are like a son to me. I pray that God our Father and Christ Jesus our Saviour will be kind to you and will bless you with peace!"
Titus,1,5,"I left you in Crete to do what had been left undone and to appoint leaders for the churches in each town. As I told you,"
Titus,1,6,they must have a good reputation and be faithful in marriage. Their children must be followers of the Lord and not have a reputation for being wild and disobedient.
Titus,1,7,"Church officials are in charge of God's work, and so they must also have a good reputation. They must not be bossy, quick-tempered, heavy drinkers, bullies, or dishonest in business."
Titus,1,8,"Instead, they must be friendly to strangers and enjoy doing good things. They must also be sensible, fair, pure, and self-controlled."
Titus,1,9,"They must stick to the true message they were taught, so that their good teaching can help others and correct everyone who opposes it."
Titus,1,10,"There are many who don't respect authority, and they fool others by talking nonsense. This is especially true of some Jewish followers."
Titus,1,11,"But you must make them be quiet. They are after money, and they upset whole families by teaching what they should not."
Titus,1,12,"It is like one of their own prophets once said, “The people of Crete always tell lies. They are greedy and lazy like wild animals.”"
Titus,1,13,"That is a true saying. And you should be hard on such people, so you can help them grow stronger in their faith."
Titus,1,14,Don't pay any attention to any of those senseless Jewish stories and human commands. These are made up by people who won't obey the truth.
Titus,1,15,Everything is pure for someone whose heart is pure. But nothing is pure for an unbeliever with a dirty mind. That person's mind and conscience are destroyed.
Titus,1,16,"Such people claim to know God, but their actions prove that they really don't. They are disgusting. They won't obey God, and they are too worthless to do anything good."
Titus,2,1,"Titus, you must teach only what is correct."
Titus,2,2,"Tell the older men to have self-control and to be serious and sensible. Their faith, love, and patience must never fail."
Titus,2,3,"Tell the older women to behave as those who love the Lord should. They must not gossip about others or be slaves of wine. They must teach what is proper,"
Titus,2,4,so the younger women will be loving wives and mothers.
Titus,2,5,"Each of the younger women must be sensible and kind, as well as a good homemaker, who puts her own husband first. Then no one can say insulting things about God's message."
Titus,2,6,Tell the young men to have self-control in everything.
Titus,2,7,Always set a good example for others. Be sincere and serious when you teach.
Titus,2,8,"Use clean language that no one can criticize. Do this, and your enemies will be too ashamed to say anything against you."
Titus,2,9,Tell slaves always to please their owners by obeying them in everything. Slaves must not talk back to their owners
Titus,2,10,or steal from them. They must be completely honest and trustworthy. Then everyone will show great respect for what is taught about God our Saviour.
Titus,2,11,God has shown us how kind he is by coming to save all people.
Titus,2,12,He taught us to give up our wicked ways and our worldly desires and to live decent and honest lives in this world.
Titus,2,13,"We are filled with hope, as we wait for the glorious return of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ."
Titus,2,14,He gave himself to rescue us from everything that is evil and to make our hearts pure. He wanted us to be his own people and to be eager to do right.
Titus,2,15,"Teach these things, as you use your full authority to encourage and correct people. Make sure you earn everyone's respect."
Titus,3,1,Remind your people to obey the rulers and authorities and not to be rebellious. They must always be ready to do something helpful
Titus,3,2,and not say cruel things or argue. They should be gentle and kind to everyone.
Titus,3,3,"We used to be stupid, disobedient, and foolish, as well as slaves of all sorts of desires and pleasures. We were evil and jealous. Everyone hated us, and we hated everyone."
Titus,3,4,God our Saviour showed us how good and kind he is.
Titus,3,5,"He saved us because of his mercy, and not because of any good things that we have done. God washed us by the power of the Holy Spirit. He gave us new birth and a fresh beginning."
Titus,3,6,God sent Jesus Christ our Saviour to give us his Spirit.
Titus,3,7,Jesus treated us much better than we deserve. He made us acceptable to God and gave us the hope of eternal life.
Titus,3,8,"This message is certainly true. These teachings are useful and helpful for everyone. I want you to insist that the people follow them, so that all who have faith in God will be sure to do good deeds."
Titus,3,9,But don't have anything to do with stupid arguments about ancestors. And stay away from disagreements and quarrels about the Law of Moses. Such arguments are useless and senseless.
Titus,3,10,Warn troublemakers once or twice. Then don't have anything else to do with them.
Titus,3,11,"You know that their minds are twisted, and their own sins show how guilty they are."
Titus,3,12,"I plan to send Artemas or Tychicus to you. After he arrives, please try your best to meet me at Nicopolis. I have decided to spend the winter there."
Titus,3,13,"When Zenas the lawyer and Apollos get ready to leave, help them as much as you can, so they won't have need of anything."
Titus,3,14,Our people should learn to spend their time doing something useful and worthwhile.
Titus,3,15,Greetings to you from everyone here. Greet all our friends who share in our faith. I pray that the Lord will be kind to all of you!
Philemon,1,1,"From Paul, who is in jail for serving Christ Jesus, and from Timothy, who is like a brother because of our faith. Philemon, you work with us and are very dear to us. This letter is to you"
Philemon,1,2,"and to the church that meets in your home. It is also to our dear friend Apphia and to Archippus, who serves the Lord as we do."
Philemon,1,3,I pray that God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you and will bless you with peace!
Philemon,1,4,"Philemon, each time I mention you in my prayers, I thank God."
Philemon,1,5,I hear about your faith in our Lord Jesus and about your love for all God's people.
Philemon,1,6,"As you share your faith with others, I pray that they may come to know-all the blessings Christ has given us."
Philemon,1,7,"My friend, your love has made me happy and has greatly encouraged me. It has also cheered the hearts of God's people."
Philemon,1,8,Christ gives me the courage to tell you what to do.
Philemon,1,9,"But I would rather ask you to do it simply because of love. Yes, as someone in jail for Christ,"
Philemon,1,10,I beg you to help Onesimus! He is like a son to me because I led him to Christ here in jail.
Philemon,1,11,"Before this, he was useless to you, but now he is useful both to you and to me."
Philemon,1,12,Sending Onesimus back to you makes me very sad.
Philemon,1,13,"I would like to keep him here with me, where he could take your place in helping me while I am here in prison for preaching the good news."
Philemon,1,14,"But I won't do anything unless you agree to it first. I want your act of kindness to come from your heart, and not be something you feel forced to do."
Philemon,1,15,"Perhaps Onesimus was taken from you for a little while so that you could have him back for good,"
Philemon,1,16,"but not as a slave. Onesimus is much more than a slave. To me he is a dear friend, but to you he is even more, both as a person and as a follower of the Lord."
Philemon,1,17,"If you consider me a friend because of Christ, then welcome Onesimus as you would welcome me."
Philemon,1,18,"If he has cheated you or owes you anything, charge it to my account."
Philemon,1,19,"With my own hand I write: I, PAUL, WILL PAY YOU BACK. But don't forget that you owe me your life."
Philemon,1,20,"My dear friend and follower of Christ our Lord, please cheer me up by doing this for me."
Philemon,1,21,"I am sure you will do all I have asked, and even more."
Philemon,1,22,"Please get a room ready for me. I hope your prayers will be answered, and I can visit you."
Philemon,1,23,"Epaphras is also here in jail for being a follower of Christ Jesus. He sends his greetings,"
Philemon,1,24,"and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, who work together with me."
Philemon,1,25,I pray that the Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you!
Hebrews,1,1,Long ago in many ways and at many times God's prophets spoke his message to our ancestors.
Hebrews,1,2,"But now at last, God sent his Son to bring his message to us. God created the universe by his Son, and everything will some day belong to the Son."
Hebrews,1,3,"God's Son has all the brightness of God's own glory and is like him in every way. By his own mighty word, he holds the universe together. After the Son had washed away our sins, he sat down at the right side of the glorious God in heaven."
Hebrews,1,4,"He had become much greater than the angels, and the name he was given is far greater than any of theirs."
Hebrews,1,5,"God has never said to any of the angels, “You are my Son, because today I have become your Father!” Neither has God said to any of them, “I will be his Father, and he will be my Son!”"
Hebrews,1,6,"When God brings his firstborn Son into the world, he commands all his angels to worship him."
Hebrews,1,7,"And when God speaks about the angels, he says, “I change my angels into wind and my servants into flaming fire.”"
Hebrews,1,8,"But God says about his Son, “You are God, and you will rule as King for ever! Your royal power brings about justice."
Hebrews,1,9,"You loved justice and hated evil, and so I, your God, have chosen you. I appointed you and made you happier than any of your friends.”"
Hebrews,1,10,"The Scriptures also say, “In the beginning, Lord, you were the one who laid the foundation of the earth and created the heavens."
Hebrews,1,11,"They will all disappear and wear out like clothes, but you will last for ever."
Hebrews,1,12,"You will roll them up like a robe and change them like a garment. But you are always the same, and you will live for ever.”"
Hebrews,1,13,"God never said to any of the angels, “Sit at my right side until I make your enemies into a footstool for you!”"
Hebrews,1,14,Angels are merely spirits sent to serve people who are going to be saved.
Hebrews,2,1,"We must give our full attention to what we were told, so that we won't drift away."
Hebrews,2,2,"The message spoken by angels proved to be true, and all who disobeyed or rejected it were punished as they deserved."
Hebrews,2,3,"So if we refuse this great way of being saved, how can we hope to escape? The Lord himself was the first to tell about it, and people who heard the message proved to us that it was true."
Hebrews,2,4,God himself showed that his message was true by performing all kinds of powerful miracles and wonders. He also gave his Holy Spirit to anyone he chose to.
Hebrews,2,5,We know that God did not put the future world under the power of angels.
Hebrews,2,6,"Somewhere in the Scriptures someone says to God, “What makes you care about us humans? Why are you concerned for weaklings such as we?"
Hebrews,2,7,You made us lower than the angels for a while. Yet you have crowned us with glory and honour.
Hebrews,2,8,And you have put everything under our power!” God has put everything under our power and has not left anything out of our power. But we still don't see it all under our power.
Hebrews,2,9,"What we do see is Jesus, who for a little while was made lower than the angels. Because of God's wonderful kindness, Jesus died for everyone. And now that Jesus has suffered and died, he is crowned with glory and honour!"
Hebrews,2,10,"Everything belongs to God, and all things were created by his power. So God did the right thing when he made Jesus perfect by suffering, as Jesus led many of God's children to be saved and to share in his glory."
Hebrews,2,11,Jesus and the people he makes holy all belong to the same family. That is why he isn't ashamed to call them his brothers and sisters.
Hebrews,2,12,"He even said to God, “I will tell them your name and sing your praises when they come together to worship.”"
Hebrews,2,13,"He also said, “I will trust God.” Then he said, “Here I am with the children God has given me.”"
Hebrews,2,14,"We are people of flesh and blood. That is why Jesus became one of us. He died to destroy the devil, who had power over death."
Hebrews,2,15,But he also died to rescue all of us who live each day in fear of dying.
Hebrews,2,16,"Jesus clearly did not come to help angels, but he did come to help Abraham's descendants."
Hebrews,2,17,"He had to be one of us, so that he could serve God as our merciful and faithful high priest and sacrifice himself for the forgiveness of our sins."
Hebrews,2,18,"And now that Jesus has suffered and was tempted, he can help anyone else who is tempted."
Hebrews,3,1,"My friends, God has chosen you to be his holy people. So think about Jesus, the one we call our apostle and high priest!"
Hebrews,3,2,"Jesus was faithful to God, who appointed him, just as Moses was faithful in serving all God's people."
Hebrews,3,3,"But Jesus deserves more honour than Moses, just as the builder of a house deserves more honour than the house."
Hebrews,3,4,"Of course, every house is built by someone, and God is really the one who built everything."
Hebrews,3,5,Moses was a faithful servant and told God's people what would be said in the future.
Hebrews,3,6,"But Christ is the Son in charge of God's people. And we are those people, if we keep on being brave and don't lose hope."
Hebrews,3,7,"It is just as the Holy Spirit says, “If you hear God's voice today,"
Hebrews,3,8,don't be stubborn! Don't rebel like those people who were tested in the desert.
Hebrews,4,1,"The promise to enter the place of rest is still good, and we must take care that none of you miss out."
Hebrews,4,2,"We have heard the message, just as they did. But they failed to believe what they heard, and the message did not do them any good."
Hebrews,4,3,"Only people who have faith will enter the place of rest. It is just as the Scriptures say, “God became angry and told the people, ‘You will never enter my place of rest!’ ” God said this, even though everything has been ready from the time of creation."
Hebrews,4,4,"In fact, somewhere the Scriptures say that by the seventh day, God had finished his work, and so he rested."
Hebrews,4,5,"We also read that he later said, “You people will never enter my place of rest!”"
Hebrews,4,6,"This means that the promise to enter is still good, because those who first heard about it disobeyed and did not enter."
Hebrews,4,7,"Much later God told David to make the promise again, just as I have already said, “If you hear his voice today, don't be stubborn!”"
Hebrews,4,8,"If Joshua had really given the people rest, there would not be any need for God to talk about another day of rest."
Hebrews,4,9,"But God has promised us a Sabbath when we will rest, even though it has not yet come."
Hebrews,4,10,"On that day God's people will rest from their work, just as God rested from his work."
Hebrews,4,11,"We should do our best to enter that place of rest, so that none of us will disobey and miss going there, as they did."
Hebrews,4,12,"What God has said isn't only alive and active! It is sharper than any double-edged sword. His word can cut through our spirits and souls and through our joints and marrow, until it discovers the desires and thoughts of our hearts."
Hebrews,4,13,"Nothing is hidden from God! He sees through everything, and we will have to tell him the truth."
Hebrews,4,14,"We have a great high priest, who has gone into heaven, and he is Jesus the Son of God. That is why we must hold on to what we have said about him."
Hebrews,4,15,"Jesus understands every weakness of ours, because he was tempted in every way that we are. But he did not sin!"
Hebrews,4,16,"So whenever we are in need, we should come bravely before the throne of our merciful God. There we will be treated with undeserved kindness, and we will find help."
Hebrews,5,1,Every high priest is appointed to help others by offering gifts and sacrifices to God because of their sins.
Hebrews,5,2,"A high priest has weaknesses of his own, and he feels sorry for foolish and sinful people."
Hebrews,5,3,That is why he must offer sacrifices for his own sins and for the sins of others.
Hebrews,5,4,"But no one can have the honour of being a high priest simply by wanting to be one. Only God can choose a priest, and God is the one who chose Aaron."
Hebrews,5,5,"That is how it was with Christ. He became a high priest, but not just because he wanted the honour of being one. It was God who told him, “You are my Son, because today I have become your Father!”"
Hebrews,5,6,"In another place, God says, “You are a priest for ever just like Melchizedek.”"
Hebrews,5,7,"God had the power to save Jesus from death. And while Jesus was on earth, he begged God with loud crying and tears to save him. He truly worshipped God, and God listened to his prayers."
Hebrews,5,8,"Jesus is God's own Son, but still he had to suffer before he could learn what it really means to obey God."
Hebrews,5,9,"Suffering made Jesus perfect, and now he can save for ever all who obey him."
Hebrews,5,10,This is because God chose him to be a high priest like Melchizedek.
Hebrews,5,11,"Much more could be said about this subject. But it is hard to explain, and all of you are slow to understand."
Hebrews,5,12,"By now you should have been teachers, but once again you need to be taught the simplest things about what God has said. You need milk instead of solid food."
Hebrews,5,13,People who live on milk are like babies who don't really know what is right.
Hebrews,5,14,Solid food is for mature people who have been trained to know right from wrong.
Hebrews,6,1,We must try to become mature and start thinking about more than just the basic things we were taught about Christ. We shouldn't need to keep talking about why we ought to turn from deeds that bring death and why we ought to have faith in God.
Hebrews,6,2,And we shouldn't need to keep teaching about baptisms or about the laying on of hands or about people being raised from death and the future judgment.
Hebrews,6,3,"Let's grow up, if God is willing."
Hebrews,7,1,"Melchizedek was both king of Salem and priest of God Most High. He was the one who went out and gave Abraham his blessing, when Abraham returned from killing the kings."
Hebrews,7,2,"Then Abraham gave him a tenth of everything he had. The meaning of the name Melchizedek is “King of Justice”. But since Salem means “peace”, he is also “King of Peace”."
Hebrews,7,3,We are not told that he had a father or mother or ancestors or beginning or end. He is like the Son of God and will be a priest for ever.
Hebrews,7,4,Notice how great Melchizedek is! Our famous ancestor Abraham gave him a tenth of what he had taken from his enemies.
Hebrews,7,5,"The Law teaches that even Abraham's descendants must give a tenth of what they possess. And they are to give this to their own relatives, who are the descendants of Levi and are priests."
Hebrews,7,6,"Although Melchizedek wasn't a descendant of Levi, Abraham gave him a tenth of what he had. Then Melchizedek blessed Abraham, who had been given God's promise."
Hebrews,7,7,Everyone agrees that a person who gives a blessing is greater than the one who receives the blessing.
Hebrews,7,8,"Priests are given a tenth of what people earn. But all priests die, except Melchizedek, and the Scriptures teach that he is alive."
Hebrews,7,9,"Levi's descendants are now the ones who receive a tenth from people. We could even say that when Abraham gave Melchizedek a tenth, Levi also gave him a tenth."
Hebrews,7,10,"This is because Levi was born later into the family of Abraham, who gave a tenth to Melchizedek."
Hebrews,7,11,"Even though the Law of Moses says that the priests must be descendants of Levi, those priests cannot make anyone perfect. So there needs to be a priest like Melchizedek, rather than one from the priestly family of Aaron."
Hebrews,7,12,"And when the rules for selecting a priest are changed, the Law must also be changed."
Hebrews,7,13,"The person we are talking about is our Lord, who came from a tribe that had never had anyone to serve as a priest at the altar."
Hebrews,7,14,"Everyone knows he came from the tribe of Judah, and Moses never said that priests would come from that tribe."
Hebrews,7,15,"All this becomes clearer, when someone who is like Melchizedek is appointed to be a priest."
Hebrews,7,16,"That person wasn't appointed because of his ancestors, but because his life can never end."
Hebrews,7,17,"The Scriptures say about him, “You are a priest for ever, just like Melchizedek.”"
Hebrews,7,18,"In this way a weak and useless command was put aside,"
Hebrews,7,19,"because the Law cannot make anything perfect. At the same time, we are given a much better hope, and it can bring us close to God."
Hebrews,8,1,What I mean is that we have a high priest who sits at the right side of God's great throne in heaven.
Hebrews,8,2,"He also serves as the priest in the most holy place inside the real tent there in heaven. This tent of worship was set up by the Lord, not by humans."
Hebrews,8,3,"Since all priests must offer gifts and sacrifices, Christ also needed to have something to offer."
Hebrews,8,4,"If he were here on earth, he would not be a priest at all, because here the Law appoints other priests to offer sacrifices."
Hebrews,8,5,"But the tent where they serve is just a copy and a shadow of the real one in heaven. Before Moses made the tent, he was told, “Be sure to make it exactly like the pattern you were shown on the mountain!”"
Hebrews,8,6,"Now Christ has been appointed to serve as a priest in a much better way, and he has given us much assurance of a better agreement."
Hebrews,8,7,"If the first agreement with God had been all right, there would not have been any need for another one."
Hebrews,8,8,"But the Lord found fault with it and said, “I tell you the time will come, when I will make a new agreement with the people of Israel and the people of Judah."
Hebrews,8,9,"It won't be like the agreement that I made with their ancestors, when I took them by the hand and led them out of Egypt. They broke their agreement with me, and I stopped caring about them!"
Hebrews,8,10,"“But now I tell the people of Israel this is my new agreement: ‘The time will come when I, the Lord, will write my laws on their minds and hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people."
Hebrews,8,11,"Not one of them will have to teach another to know me, their Lord.’ “All of them will know me, no matter who they are."
Hebrews,8,12,"I will treat them with kindness, even though they are wicked. I will forget their sins.”"
Hebrews,8,13,"When the Lord talks about a new agreement, he means that the first one is out of date. And anything that is old and useless will soon disappear."
Hebrews,9,1,The first promise that was made included rules for worship and a tent for worship here on earth.
Hebrews,9,2,"The first part of the tent was called the holy place, and a lampstand, a table, and the sacred loaves of bread were kept there."
Hebrews,9,3,Behind the curtain was the most holy place.
Hebrews,9,4,"The gold altar that was used for burning incense was in this holy place. The gold-covered sacred chest was also there, and inside it were three things. First, there was a gold jar filled with manna. Then there was Aaron's walking stick that sprouted. Finally, there were the flat stones with the Ten Commandments written on them."
Hebrews,9,5,On top of the chest were the glorious creatures with wings opened out above the place of mercy. Now isn't the time to go into detail about these things.
Hebrews,9,6,But this is how everything was when the priests went each day into the first part of the tent to do their duties.
Hebrews,9,7,"However, only the high priest could go into the second part of the tent, and he went in only once a year. Each time he carried blood to offer for his sins and for any sins that the people had committed without meaning to."
Hebrews,9,8,All this is the Holy Spirit's way of saying that no one could enter the most holy place while the tent was still the place of worship.
Hebrews,9,9,This also has a meaning for today. It shows that we cannot make our consciences clear by offering gifts and sacrifices.
Hebrews,9,10,These rules are merely about such things as eating and drinking and ceremonies for washing ourselves. And rules about physical things will last only until the time comes to change them for something better.
Hebrews,9,11,Christ came as the high priest of the good things that are now here. He also went into a much better tent that wasn't made by humans and that doesn't belong to this world.
Hebrews,9,12,Then Christ went once for all into the most holy place and freed us from sin for ever. He did this by offering his own blood instead of the blood of goats and bulls.
Hebrews,9,13,"According to the Law of Moses, those people who become unclean are not fit to worship God. Yet they will be considered clean, if they are sprinkled with the blood of goats and bulls and with the ashes of a sacrificed calf."
Hebrews,9,14,"But Christ was sinless, and he offered himself as an eternal and spiritual sacrifice to God. That's why his blood is much more powerful and makes our consciences clear. Now we can serve the living God and no longer do things that lead to death."
Hebrews,9,15,Christ died to rescue those who had sinned and broken the old agreement. Now he brings his chosen ones a new agreement with its guarantee of God's eternal blessings!
Hebrews,9,16,"In fact, making an agreement of this kind is like writing a will. This is because the one who makes the will must die before it is of any use."
Hebrews,9,17,"In other words, a will doesn't go into effect as long as the one who made it is still alive."
Hebrews,9,18,Blood was also used to put the first agreement into effect.
Hebrews,9,19,Moses told the people all that the Law said they must do. Then he used red wool and a hyssop plant to sprinkle the people and the book of the Law with the blood of bulls and goats and with water.
Hebrews,9,20,"He told the people, “With this blood God makes his agreement with you.”"
Hebrews,9,21,Moses also sprinkled blood on the tent and on everything else that was used in worship.
Hebrews,9,22,"The Law says that almost everything must be sprinkled with blood, and no sins can be forgiven unless blood is offered."
Hebrews,9,23,"These things are only copies of what is in heaven, and so they had to be made holy by these ceremonies. But the real things in heaven must be made holy by something better."
Hebrews,9,24,"This is why Christ did not go into a tent that had been made by humans and was only a copy of the real one. Instead, he went into heaven and is now there with God to help us."
Hebrews,9,25,Christ did not have to offer himself many times. He wasn't like a high priest who goes into the most holy place each year to offer the blood of an animal.
Hebrews,9,26,"If he had offered himself every year, he would have suffered many times since the creation of the world. But instead, near the end of time he offered himself once and for all, so that he could be a sacrifice that does away with sin."
Hebrews,9,27,"We die only once, and then we are judged."
Hebrews,9,28,"So Christ died only once to take away the sins of many people. But when he comes again, it will not be to take away sin. He will come to save everyone who is waiting for him."
Hebrews,10,1,"The Law of Moses is like a shadow of the good things to come. This shadow isn't the good things themselves, because it cannot free people from sin by the sacrifices that are offered year after year."
Hebrews,10,2,"If there were worshippers who already have their sins washed away and their consciences made clear, there would not be any need to go on offering sacrifices."
Hebrews,11,1,Faith makes us sure of what we hope for and gives us proof of what we cannot see.
Hebrews,11,2,It was their faith that made our ancestors pleasing to God.
Hebrews,11,3,"Because of our faith, we know that the world was made at God's command. We also know that what can be seen was made out of what cannot be seen."
Hebrews,11,4,"Because Abel had faith, he offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did. God was pleased with him and his gift, and even though Abel is now dead, his faith still speaks for him."
Hebrews,11,5,"Enoch had faith and did not die. He pleased God, and God took him up to heaven. That's why his body was never found."
Hebrews,11,6,But without faith no one can please God. We must believe that God is real and that he rewards everyone who searches for him.
Hebrews,11,7,"Because Noah had faith, he was warned about something that had not yet happened. He obeyed and built a boat that saved him and his family. In this way the people of the world were judged, and Noah was given the blessings that come to everyone who pleases God."
Hebrews,11,8,"Abraham had faith and obeyed God. He was told to go to the land that God had said would be his, and he left for a country he had never seen."
Hebrews,11,9,"Because Abraham had faith, he lived as a stranger in the promised land. He lived there in a tent, and so did Isaac and Jacob, who were later given the same promise."
Hebrews,11,10,"Abraham did this, because he was waiting for the eternal city that God had planned and built."
Hebrews,11,11,"Even when Sarah was too old to have children, she had faith that God would do what he had promised, and she had a son."
Hebrews,11,12,"Her husband Abraham was almost dead, but he became the ancestor of many people. In fact, there are as many of them as there are stars in the sky or grains of sand along the beach."
Hebrews,11,13,"Every one of those people died. But they still had faith, even though they had not received what they had been promised. They were glad just to see these things from far away, and they agreed that they were only strangers and foreigners on this earth."
Hebrews,11,14,"When people talk this way, it is clear that they are looking for a place to call their own."
Hebrews,11,15,"If they had been talking about the land where they had once lived, they could have gone back at any time."
Hebrews,11,16,But they were looking forward to a better home in heaven. That's why God wasn't ashamed for them to call him their God. He even built a city for them.
Hebrews,12,1,"Such a large crowd of witnesses is all around us! So we must get rid of everything that slows us down, especially the sin that just won't let go. And we must be determined to run the race that is ahead of us."
Hebrews,12,2,"We must keep our eyes on Jesus, who leads us and makes our faith complete. He endured the shame of being nailed to a cross, because he knew that later on he would be glad he did. Now he is seated at the right side of God's throne!"
Hebrews,12,3,"So keep your mind on Jesus, who put up with many insults from sinners. Then you won't get discouraged and give up."
Hebrews,12,4,None of you have yet been hurt in your battle against sin.
Hebrews,12,5,"But you have forgotten that the Scriptures say to God's children, “When the Lord punishes you, don't make light of it, and when he corrects you, don't be discouraged."
Hebrews,12,6,The Lord corrects the people he loves and disciplines those he calls his own.”
Hebrews,12,7,Be patient when you are being corrected! This is how God treats his children. Don't all parents correct their children?
Hebrews,12,8,"God corrects all his children, and if he doesn't correct you, then you don't really belong to him."
Hebrews,12,9,"Our earthly fathers correct us, and we still respect them. Isn't it even better to be given true life by letting our spiritual Father correct us?"
Hebrews,12,10,"Our human fathers correct us for a short time, and they do it as they think best. But God corrects us for our own good, because he wants us to be holy, as he is."
Hebrews,12,11,"It is never fun to be corrected. In fact, at the time it is always painful. But if we learn to obey by being corrected, we will do right and live at peace."
Hebrews,12,12,Now stand up straight! Stop your knees from shaking
Hebrews,12,13,"and walk a straight path. Then lame people will be healed, instead of getting worse."
Hebrews,12,14,"Try to live at peace with everyone! Live a clean life. If you don't, you will never see the Lord."
Hebrews,12,15,Make sure that no one misses out on God's wonderful kindness. Don't let anyone become bitter and cause trouble for the rest of you.
Hebrews,12,16,"Watch out for immoral and ungodly people like Esau, who sold his future blessing for only one meal."
Hebrews,12,17,"You know how he later wanted it back. But there was nothing he could do to change things, even though he begged his father and cried."
Hebrews,12,18,You have not come to a place like Mount Sinai that can be seen and touched. There is no flaming fire or dark cloud or storm
Hebrews,12,19,"or trumpet sound. The people of Israel heard a voice speak. But they begged it to stop,"
Hebrews,12,20,because they could not obey its commands. They were even told to kill any animal that touched the mountain.
Hebrews,12,21,The sight was so frightening that Moses said he shook with fear.
Hebrews,12,22,"You have now come to Mount Zion and to the heavenly Jerusalem. This is the city of the living God, where thousands and thousands of angels have come to celebrate."
Hebrews,12,23,"Here you will find all God's dearest children, whose names are written in heaven. And you will find God himself, who judges everyone. Here also are the spirits of those good people who have been made perfect."
Hebrews,12,24,"And Jesus is here! He is the one who makes God's new agreement with us, and his sprinkled blood says much better things than the blood of Abel."
Hebrews,12,25,"Make sure that you obey the one who speaks to you. The people did not escape, when they refused to obey the one who spoke to them at Mount Sinai. Do you think you can possibly escape, if you refuse to obey the one who speaks to you from heaven?"
Hebrews,12,26,"When God spoke the first time, his voice shook only the earth. This time he has promised to shake the earth once again, and heaven too."
Hebrews,12,27,The words “once again” mean that these created things will some day be shaken and removed. Then what cannot be shaken will last.
Hebrews,12,28,We should be grateful that we were given a kingdom that cannot be shaken. And in this kingdom we please God by worshipping him and by showing him great honour and respect.
Hebrews,12,29,Our God is like a destructive fire!
Hebrews,13,1,Keep being concerned about each other as the Lord's followers should.
Hebrews,13,2,"Be sure to welcome strangers into your home. By doing this, some people have welcomed angels as guests, without even knowing it."
Hebrews,13,3,"Remember the Lord's people who are in jail and be concerned for them. Don't forget those who are suffering, but imagine that you are there with them."
Hebrews,13,4,"Have respect for marriage. Always be faithful to your partner, because God will punish anyone who is immoral or unfaithful in marriage."
Hebrews,13,5,Don't fall in love with money. Be satisfied with what you have. The Lord has promised that he will not leave us or desert us.
Hebrews,13,6,"That should make you feel like saying, “The Lord helps me! Why should I be afraid of what people can do to me?”"
Hebrews,13,7,Don't forget about your leaders who taught you God's message. Remember what kind of lives they lived and try to have faith like theirs.
Hebrews,13,8,"Jesus Christ never changes! He is the same yesterday, today, and for ever."
Hebrews,13,9,"Don't be fooled by any kind of strange teachings. It is better to receive strength from God's undeserved kindness than to depend on certain foods. After all, these foods don't really help the people who eat them."
Hebrews,13,10,But we have an altar where even the priests who serve in the place of worship have no right to eat.
Hebrews,13,11,"After the high priest offers the blood of animals as a sin offering, the bodies of those animals are burnt outside the camp."
Hebrews,13,12,"Jesus himself suffered outside the city gate, so that his blood would make people holy."
Hebrews,13,13,That's why we should go outside the camp to Jesus and share in his disgrace.
Hebrews,13,14,"On this earth we don't have a city that lasts for ever, but we are waiting for such a city."
Hebrews,13,15,Our sacrifice is to keep offering praise to God in the name of Jesus.
Hebrews,13,16,But don't forget to help others and to share your possessions with them. This too is like offering a sacrifice that pleases God.
Hebrews,13,17,"Obey your leaders and do what they say. They are watching over you, and they must answer to God. So don't make them sad as they do their work. Make them happy. Otherwise, they won't be able to help you at all."
Hebrews,13,18,"Pray for us. Our consciences are clear, and we always try to live right."
Hebrews,13,19,I especially want you to pray that I can visit you again soon.
Hebrews,13,20,"God gives peace, and he raised our Lord Jesus Christ from death. Now Jesus is like a Great Shepherd whose blood was used to make God's eternal agreement with his flock."
Hebrews,13,21,I pray that God will make you ready to obey him and that you will always be eager to do right. May Jesus help you do what pleases God. To Jesus Christ be glory for ever and ever! Amen.
Hebrews,13,22,"My friends, I have written only a short letter to encourage you, and I beg you to pay close attention to what I have said."
Hebrews,13,23,"By now you must know that our friend Timothy is out of jail. If he gets here in time, I will bring him with me when I come to visit you."
Hebrews,13,24,Please give my greetings to your leaders and to the rest of the Lord's people. His followers from Italy send you their greetings.
Hebrews,13,25,I pray that God will be kind to all of you!
James,1,1,"From James, a servant of God and of our Lord Jesus Christ. Greetings to the twelve tribes scattered all over the world."
James,1,2,"My friends, be glad, even if you have a lot of trouble."
James,1,3,You know that you learn to endure by having your faith tested.
James,1,4,"But you must learn to endure everything, so that you will be completely mature and not lacking in anything."
James,1,5,"If any of you need wisdom, you should ask God, and it will be given to you. God is generous and won't correct you for asking."
James,1,6,"But when you ask for something, you must have faith and not doubt. Anyone who doubts is like an ocean wave tossed around in a storm."
James,2,1,"My friends, if you have faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ, you won't treat some people better than others."
James,2,2,Suppose a rich person wearing fine clothes and a gold ring comes to one of your meetings. And suppose a poor person dressed in worn out clothes also comes.
James,2,3,You must not give the best seat to the one in fine clothes and tell the one who is poor to stand at the side or sit on the floor.
James,2,4,"That is the same as saying that some people are better than others, and you would be acting like a crooked judge."
James,2,5,"My dear friends, pay attention. God has given a lot of faith to the poor people in this world. He has also promised them a share in his kingdom that he will give to everyone who loves him."
James,2,6,You ill-treat the poor. But isn't it the rich who boss you around and drag you off to court?
James,2,7,Aren't they the ones who make fun of your Lord?
James,2,8,"You will do well, if you obey the most important law in the Scriptures. It is the law that commands us to love others as much as we love ourselves."
James,2,9,"But if you treat some people better than others, you have done wrong, and the Scriptures teach that you have sinned."
James,2,10,"If you obey every law except one, you are still guilty of breaking them all."
James,2,11,"The same God who told us to be faithful in marriage also told us not to murder. So even if you are faithful in marriage, but murder someone, you have still broken God's Law."
James,2,12,Speak and act like people who will be judged by the law that sets us free.
James,2,13,"Do this, because on the day of judgment there will be no pity for those who have not had pity on others. But even in judgment, God is merciful!"
James,2,14,"My friends, what good is it to say you have faith, when you don't do anything to show that you really do have faith? Can that kind of faith save you?"
James,2,15,"If you know someone who doesn't have any clothes or food,"
James,2,16,"you shouldn't just say, “I hope all goes well for you. I hope you will be warm and have plenty to eat.” What good is it to say this, unless you do something to help?"
James,2,17,Faith that doesn't lead us to do good deeds is all alone and dead!
James,2,18,"Suppose someone disagrees and says, “It is possible to have faith without doing kind deeds.” I would answer, “Prove that you have faith without doing kind deeds, and I will prove that I have faith by doing them.”"
James,2,19,"You believe there is only one God. That's fine. Even demons believe this, and it makes them shake with fear."
James,2,20,Does some stupid person want proof that faith without deeds is useless?
James,2,21,"Well, our ancestor Abraham pleased God by putting his son Isaac on the altar to sacrifice him."
James,2,22,Now you see how Abraham's faith and deeds worked together. He proved that his faith was real by what he did.
James,2,23,"This is what the Scriptures mean by saying, “Abraham had faith in God, and God was pleased with him.” That's how Abraham became God's friend."
James,2,24,You can now see that we please God by what we do and not only by what we believe.
James,2,25,"For example, Rahab had been a prostitute. But she pleased God when she welcomed the spies and sent them home by another way."
James,2,26,"Anyone who doesn't breathe is dead, and faith that doesn't do anything is just as dead!"
James,3,1,"My friends, we should not all try to become teachers. In fact, teachers will be judged more strictly than others."
James,3,2,"All of us do many wrong things. But if you can control your tongue, you are mature and able to control your whole body."
James,3,3,"By putting a bit into the mouth of a horse, we can turn the horse in different directions."
James,3,4,"It takes strong winds to move a large sailing ship, but the captain uses only a small rudder to make it go in any direction."
James,3,5,"Our tongues are small too, and yet they boast about big things. It takes only a spark to start a forest fire!"
James,3,6,The tongue is like a spark. It is an evil power that dirties the rest of the body and sets a person's entire life on fire with flames that come from hell itself.
James,3,7,"All kinds of animals, birds, reptiles, and sea creatures can be tamed and have been tamed."
James,3,8,"But our tongues get out of control. They are restless and evil, and always spreading deadly poison."
James,4,1,Why do you fight and argue with each other? Isn't it because you are full of selfish desires that fight to control your body?
James,4,2,"You want something you don't have, and you will do anything to get it. You will even kill! But you still cannot get what you want, and you won't get it by fighting and arguing. You should pray for it."
James,4,3,"Yet even when you do pray, your prayers are not answered, because you pray just for selfish reasons."
James,4,4,"You people aren't faithful to God! Don't you know that if you love the world, you are God's enemies? And if you decide to be a friend of the world, you make yourself an enemy of God."
James,4,5,"Do you doubt the Scriptures that say, “God truly cares about the Spirit he has put in us”?"
James,4,6,"In fact, God treats us with even greater kindness, just as the Scriptures say, “God opposes everyone who is proud, but he is kind to everyone who is humble.”"
James,4,7,"Surrender to God! Resist the devil, and he will run from you."
James,4,8,"Come near to God, and he will come near to you. Clean up your lives, you sinners. Purify your hearts, you people who can't make up your mind."
James,4,9,Be sad and sorry and weep. Stop laughing and start crying. Be gloomy instead of glad.
James,4,10,"Be humble in the Lord's presence, and he will honour you."
James,4,11,"My friends, don't say cruel things about others! If you do, or if you condemn others, you are condemning God's Law. And if you condemn the Law, you put yourself above the Law and refuse to obey either it"
James,4,12,"or God who gave it. God is our judge, and he can save or destroy us. What right do you have to condemn anyone?"
James,4,13,"You should know better than to say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to the city. We will do business there for a year and make a lot of money!”"
James,4,14,What do you know about tomorrow? How can you be so sure about your life? It is nothing more than mist that appears for only a little while before it disappears.
James,4,15,"You should say, “If the Lord lets us live, we will do these things.”"
James,4,16,"Yet you are stupid enough to boast, and it is wrong to be so proud."
James,4,17,"If you don't do what you know is right, you have sinned."
James,5,1,You rich people should cry and weep! Terrible things are going to happen to you.
James,5,2,"Your treasures have already rotted, and moths have eaten your clothes."
James,5,3,"Your money has rusted, and the rust will be evidence against you, as it burns your body like fire. Yet you keep on storing up wealth in these last days."
James,5,4,"You refused to pay the people who worked in your fields, and now their unpaid wages are shouting out against you. The Lord All-Powerful has heard the cries of the workers who harvested your crops."
James,5,5,"While here on earth, you have thought only of filling your own stomachs and having a good time. But now you are like fat cattle on their way to be butchered."
James,5,6,"You have condemned and murdered innocent people, who couldn't even fight back."
James,5,7,"My friends, be patient until the Lord returns. Think of farmers who wait patiently for the spring and summer rains to make their valuable crops grow."
James,5,8,Be patient like those farmers and don't give up. The Lord will soon be here!
James,5,9,"Don't grumble about each other or you will be judged, and the judge is just outside the door."
James,5,10,"My friends, follow the example of the prophets who spoke for the Lord. They were patient, even when they had to suffer."
James,5,11,"In fact, we praise the ones who endured the most. You remember how patient Job was and how the Lord finally helped him. The Lord did this because he is so merciful and kind."
James,5,12,"My friends, above all else, don't take an oath. You must not swear by heaven or by earth or by anything else. “Yes” or “No” is all you need to say. If you say anything more, you will be condemned."
James,5,13,"If you are having trouble, you should pray. And if you are feeling good, you should sing praises."
James,5,14,"If you are sick, ask the church leaders to come and pray for you. Ask them to put olive oil on you in the name of the Lord."
James,5,15,"If you have faith when you pray for sick people, they will get well. The Lord will heal them, and if they have sinned, he will forgive them."
James,5,16,"If you have sinned, you should tell each other what you have done. Then you can pray for one another and be healed. The prayer of an innocent person is powerful, and it can help a lot."
James,5,17,"Elijah was just as human as we are, and for three and a half years his prayers kept the rain from falling."
James,5,18,"But when he did pray for rain, it fell from the skies and made the crops grow."
James,5,19,"My friends, if any followers have wandered away from the truth, you should try to lead them back."
James,5,20,"If you turn sinners from the wrong way, you will save them from death, and many of their sins will be forgiven."
1 Peter,1,1,"From Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ. To God's people who are scattered like foreigners in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia."
1 Peter,1,2,"God the Father decided to choose you as his people, and his Spirit has made you holy. You have obeyed Jesus Christ and are sprinkled with his blood. I pray that God will be kind to you and will keep on giving you peace!"
1 Peter,1,3,"Praise God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. God is so good, and by raising Jesus from death, he has given us new life and a hope that lives on."
1 Peter,1,4,"God has something stored up for you in heaven, where it will never decay or be ruined or disappear."
1 Peter,1,5,"You have faith in God, whose power will protect you until the last day. Then he will save you, just as he has always planned to do."
1 Peter,1,6,"On that day you will be glad, even if you have to go through many hard trials for a while."
1 Peter,1,7,Your faith will be like gold that has been tested in a fire. And these trials will prove that your faith is worth much more than gold that can be destroyed. They will show that you will be given praise and honour and glory when Jesus Christ returns.
1 Peter,1,8,"You have never seen Jesus, and you don't see him now. But still you love him and have faith in him, and no words can tell how glad and happy"
1 Peter,1,9,you are to be saved. That's why you have faith.
1 Peter,1,10,"Some prophets told how kind God would be to you, and they searched hard to find out more about the way you would be saved."
1 Peter,1,11,The Spirit of Christ was in them and was telling them how Christ would suffer and would then be given great honour. So they searched to find out exactly who Christ would be and when this would happen.
1 Peter,1,12,"But they were told that they were serving you and not themselves. They preached to you by the power of the Holy Spirit, who was sent from heaven. And their message was only for you, even though angels would like to know more about it."
1 Peter,1,13,Be alert and think straight. Put all your hope in how kind God will be to you when Jesus Christ appears.
1 Peter,1,14,"Behave like obedient children. Don't let your lives be controlled by your desires, as they used to be."
1 Peter,1,15,"Always live as God's holy people should, because God is the one who chose you, and he is holy."
1 Peter,1,16,"That's why the Scriptures say, “I am the holy God, and you must be holy too.”"
1 Peter,1,17,"You say that God is your Father, but God doesn't have favourites! He judges all people by what they do. So you must honour God while you live as strangers here on earth."
1 Peter,1,18,You were rescued from the useless way of life that you learnt from your ancestors. But you know that you were not rescued by such things as silver or gold that don't last for ever.
1 Peter,1,19,"You were rescued by the precious blood of Christ, that spotless and innocent lamb."
1 Peter,1,20,"Christ was chosen even before the world was created, but because of you, he did not come until these last days."
1 Peter,1,21,"And when he did come, it was to lead you to have faith in God, who raised him from death and honoured him in a glorious way. That's why you have put your faith and hope in God."
1 Peter,1,22,"You obeyed the truth, and your souls were made pure. Now you sincerely love each other. But you must keep on loving with all your heart."
1 Peter,1,23,Do this because God has given you new birth by his message that lives on for ever.
1 Peter,1,24,"The Scriptures say, “Humans wither like grass, and their glory fades like wild flowers. Grass dries up, and flowers fall to the ground."
1 Peter,1,25,But what the Lord has said will stand for ever.” Our good news to you is what the Lord has said.
1 Peter,2,1,"Stop being hateful! Stop trying to fool people, and start being sincere. Don't be jealous or say cruel things about others."
1 Peter,2,2,Be like newborn babies who are thirsty for the pure spiritual milk that will help you grow and be saved.
1 Peter,2,3,You have already found out how good the Lord really is.
1 Peter,2,4,"Come to Jesus Christ. He is the living stone that people have rejected, but which God has chosen and highly honoured."
1 Peter,2,5,"And now you are living stones that are being used to build a spiritual house. You are also a group of holy priests, and with the help of Jesus Christ you will offer sacrifices that please God."
1 Peter,2,6,"It is just as God says in the Scriptures, “Look! I am placing in Zion a choice and precious cornerstone. No one who has faith in that one will be disappointed.”"
1 Peter,2,7,"You are followers of the Lord, and that stone is precious to you. But it isn't precious to those who refuse to follow him. They are the builders who tossed aside the stone that turned out to be the most important one of all."
1 Peter,2,8,"They disobeyed the message and stumbled and fell over that stone, because they were doomed."
1 Peter,2,9,"But you are God's chosen and special people. You are a group of royal priests and a holy nation. God has brought you out of darkness into his marvellous light. Now you must tell all the wonderful things that he has done. The Scriptures say,"
1 Peter,2,10,“Once you were nobody. Now you are God's people. At one time no one had pity on you. Now God has treated you with kindness.”
1 Peter,2,11,"Dear friends, you are foreigners and strangers on this earth. So I beg you not to surrender to those desires that fight against you."
1 Peter,2,12,"Always let others see you behaving properly, even though they may still accuse you of doing wrong. Then on the day of judgment, they will honour God by telling the good things they saw you do."
1 Peter,2,13,"The Lord wants you to obey all human authorities, especially the Emperor, who rules over everyone."
1 Peter,2,14,"You must also obey governors, because they are sent by the Emperor to punish criminals and to praise good citizens."
1 Peter,2,15,God wants you to silence stupid and ignorant people by doing right.
1 Peter,2,16,"You are free, but still you are God's servants, and you must not use your freedom as an excuse for doing wrong."
1 Peter,2,17,Respect everyone and show special love for God's people. Honour God and respect the Emperor.
1 Peter,2,18,"Servants, you must obey your masters and always show respect to them. Do this, not only to those who are kind and thoughtful, but also to those who are cruel."
1 Peter,2,19,"God will bless you, even if others treat you unfairly for being loyal to him."
1 Peter,2,20,"You don't gain anything by being punished for some wrong you have done. But God will bless you, if you have to suffer for doing something good."
1 Peter,2,21,"After all, God chose you to suffer as you follow in the footsteps of Christ, who set an example by suffering for you."
1 Peter,2,22,Christ did not sin or ever tell a lie.
1 Peter,2,23,"Although he was abused, he never tried to get even. And when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he had faith in God, who judges fairly."
1 Peter,2,24,"Christ carried the burden of our sins. He was nailed to the cross, so that we would stop sinning and start living right. By his cuts and bruises you are healed."
1 Peter,2,25,You had wandered away like sheep. Now you have returned to the one who is your shepherd and protector.
1 Peter,3,1,"If you are a wife, you must put your husband first. Even if he opposes our message, you will win him over by what you do. No one else will have to say anything to him,"
1 Peter,3,2,because he will see how you honour God and live a pure life.
1 Peter,3,3,Don't depend on things like fancy hair styles or gold jewellery or expensive clothes to make you look beautiful.
1 Peter,3,4,"Be beautiful in your heart by being gentle and quiet. This kind of beauty will last, and God considers it very special."
1 Peter,3,5,Long ago those women who worshipped God and put their hope in him made themselves beautiful by putting their husbands first.
1 Peter,3,6,"For example, Sarah obeyed Abraham and called him her master. You are her true children, if you do right and don't let anything frighten you."
1 Peter,3,7,"If you are a husband, you should be thoughtful of your wife. Treat her with honour, because she isn't as strong as you are, and she shares with you in the gift of life. Then nothing will stand in the way of your prayers."
1 Peter,3,8,"Finally, all of you should agree and have concern and love for each other. You should also be kind and humble."
1 Peter,3,9,"Don't be hateful and insult people just because they are hateful and insult you. Instead, treat everyone with kindness. You are God's chosen ones, and he will bless you. The Scriptures say,"
1 Peter,3,10,“Do you really love life? Do you want to be happy? Then stop saying cruel things and stop telling lies.
1 Peter,3,11,"Give up your evil ways and do right, as you find and follow the road that leads to peace."
1 Peter,3,12,"The Lord watches over everyone who obeys him, and he listens to their prayers. But he opposes everyone who does evil.”"
1 Peter,3,13,Can anyone really harm you for being eager to do good deeds?
1 Peter,3,14,"Even if you have to suffer for doing good things, God will bless you. So stop being afraid and don't worry about what people might do."
1 Peter,3,15,Honour Christ and let him be the Lord of your life. Always be ready to give an answer when someone asks you about your hope.
1 Peter,3,16,Give a kind and respectful answer and keep your conscience clear. This way you will make people ashamed for saying bad things about your good conduct as a follower of Christ.
1 Peter,3,17,You are better off to obey God and suffer for doing right than to suffer for doing wrong.
1 Peter,3,18,"Christ died once for our sins. An innocent person died for those who are guilty. Christ did this to bring you to God, when his body was put to death and his spirit was made alive."
1 Peter,3,19,Christ then preached to the spirits that were being kept in prison.
1 Peter,3,20,"They had disobeyed God while Noah was building the boat, but God had been patient with them. Eight people went into that boat and were brought safely through the flood."
1 Peter,3,21,"Those flood waters were like baptism that now saves you. But baptism is more than just washing your body. It means turning to God with a clear conscience, because Jesus Christ was raised from death."
1 Peter,3,22,"Christ is now in heaven, where he sits at the right side of God. All angels, authorities, and powers are under his control."
1 Peter,4,1,"Christ suffered here on earth. Now you must be ready to suffer as he did, because suffering shows that you have stopped sinning."
1 Peter,4,2,It means you have turned from your own desires and want to obey God for the rest of your life.
1 Peter,4,3,"You have already lived long enough like people who don't know God. You were immoral and followed your evil desires. You went around drinking and feasting and carrying on. In fact, you even worshipped disgusting idols."
1 Peter,4,4,"Now your former friends wonder why you have stopped running around with them, and they curse you for it."
1 Peter,4,5,"But they will have to answer to God, who judges the living and the dead."
1 Peter,4,6,"The good news has even been preached to the dead, so that after they have been judged for what they have done in this life, their spirits will live with God."
1 Peter,4,7,Everything will soon come to an end. So be serious and be sensible enough to pray.
1 Peter,4,8,"Most important of all, you must sincerely love each other, because love wipes away many sins."
1 Peter,4,9,Welcome people into your home and don't grumble about it.
1 Peter,4,10,Each of you has been blessed with one of God's many wonderful gifts to be used in the service of others. So use your gift well.
1 Peter,4,11,"If you have the gift of speaking, preach God's message. If you have the gift of helping others, do it with the strength that God supplies. Everything should be done in a way that will bring honour to God because of Jesus Christ, who is glorious and powerful for ever. Amen."
1 Peter,4,12,"Dear friends, don't be surprised or shocked that you are going through testing that is like walking through fire."
1 Peter,4,13,Be glad for the chance to suffer as Christ suffered. It will prepare you for even greater happiness when he makes his glorious return.
1 Peter,4,14,Count it a blessing when you suffer for being a Christian. This shows that God's glorious Spirit is with you.
1 Peter,4,15,"But you deserve to suffer if you are a murderer, a thief, a criminal, or a busybody."
1 Peter,4,16,Don't be ashamed to suffer for being a Christian. Praise God that you belong to him.
1 Peter,4,17,"God has already begun judging his own people. And if his judgment begins with us, imagine how terrible it will be for those who refuse to obey his message. The Scriptures say,"
1 Peter,4,18,"“If good people barely escape, what will happen to sinners and to others who don't respect God?”"
1 Peter,4,19,"If you suffer for obeying God, you must have complete faith in your faithful Creator and keep on doing right."
1 Peter,5,1,"Church leaders, I am writing to encourage you. I too am a leader, as well as a witness to Christ's suffering, and I will share in his glory when it is shown to us."
1 Peter,5,2,"Just as shepherds watch over their sheep, you must watch over everyone God has placed in your care. Do it willingly in order to please God, and not simply because you think you must. Let it be something you want to do, instead of something you do merely to make money."
1 Peter,5,3,"Don't be bossy to those people who are in your care, but set an example for them."
1 Peter,5,4,"Then when Christ the Chief Shepherd returns, you will be given a crown that will never lose its glory."
1 Peter,5,5,"All you young people should obey your elders. In fact, everyone should be humble towards everyone else. The Scriptures say, “God opposes proud people, but he helps everyone who is humble.”"
1 Peter,5,6,"Be humble in the presence of God's mighty power, and he will honour you when the time comes."
1 Peter,5,7,"God cares for you, so turn all your worries over to him."
1 Peter,5,8,"Be on your guard and stay awake. Your enemy, the devil, is like a roaring lion, prowling around to find someone to attack."
1 Peter,5,9,But you must resist the devil and stay strong in your faith. You know that all over the world the Lord's followers are suffering just as you are.
1 Peter,5,10,"But God shows undeserved kindness to everyone. That's why he appointed Christ Jesus to choose you to share in his eternal glory. You will suffer for a while, but God will make you complete, steady, strong, and firm."
1 Peter,5,11,God will be in control for ever! Amen.
1 Peter,5,12,"Silvanus helped me write this short letter, and I consider him a faithful follower of the Lord. I wanted to encourage you and tell you how kind God really is, so that you will keep on having faith in him."
1 Peter,5,13,"Greetings from the Lord's followers in Babylon. They are God's chosen ones. Mark, who is like a son to me, sends his greetings too."
1 Peter,5,14,Give each other a warm greeting. I pray that God will give peace to everyone who belongs to Christ.
2 Peter,1,1,"From Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ. To everyone who shares with us in the privilege of believing that our God and Saviour Jesus Christ will do what is just and fair."
2 Peter,1,2,I pray that God will be kind to you and will let you live in perfect peace! May you keep learning more and more about God and our Lord Jesus.
2 Peter,1,3,"We have everything we need to live a life that pleases God. It was all given to us by God's own power, when we learnt that he had invited us to share in his wonderful goodness."
2 Peter,1,4,"God made great and marvellous promises, so that his nature would become part of us. Then we could escape our evil desires and the corrupt influences of this world."
2 Peter,1,5,"Do your best to improve your faith. You can do this by adding goodness, understanding,"
2 Peter,1,6,"self-control, patience, devotion to God,"
2 Peter,1,7,"concern for others, and love."
2 Peter,1,8,"If you keep growing in this way, it will show that what you know about our Lord Jesus Christ has made your lives useful and meaningful."
2 Peter,1,9,"But if you don't grow, you are like someone who is nearsighted or blind, and you have forgotten that your past sins are forgiven."
2 Peter,1,10,"My friends, you must do all you can to show that God has really chosen and selected you. If you keep on doing this, you won't stumble and fall."
2 Peter,1,11,Then our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ will give you a glorious welcome into his kingdom that will last for ever.
2 Peter,1,12,You are holding firmly to the truth that you were given. But I am still going to remind you of these things.
2 Peter,1,13,"In fact, I think I should keep on reminding you until I leave this body."
2 Peter,1,14,And our Lord Jesus Christ has already told me that I will soon leave it behind.
2 Peter,1,15,That is why I am doing my best to make sure that each of you remembers all this after I am gone.
2 Peter,1,16,"When we told you about the power and the return of our Lord Jesus Christ, we were not telling clever stories that someone had made up. But with our own eyes we saw his true greatness."
2 Peter,1,17,"God, our great and wonderful Father, truly honoured him by saying, “This is my own dear Son, and I am pleased with him.”"
2 Peter,1,18,We were there with Jesus on the holy mountain and heard this voice speak from heaven.
2 Peter,1,19,"All this makes us even more certain that what the prophets said is true. So you should pay close attention to their message, as you would to a lamp shining in some dark place. You must keep on paying attention until daylight comes and the morning star rises in your hearts."
2 Peter,1,20,But you need to realize that no one alone can understand any of the prophecies in the Scriptures.
2 Peter,1,21,"The prophets did not think these things up on their own, but they were guided by the Spirit of God."
2 Peter,2,1,"Sometimes false prophets spoke to the people of Israel. False teachers will also sneak in and speak harmful lies to you. But these teachers don't really belong to the Master who paid a great price for them, and they will quickly destroy themselves."
2 Peter,2,2,Many people will follow their evil ways and cause others to tell lies about the true way.
2 Peter,2,3,"They will be greedy and cheat you with smooth talk. But long ago God decided to punish them, and God doesn't sleep."
2 Peter,2,4,God did not have pity on the angels that sinned. He had them tied up and thrown into the dark pits of hell until the time of judgment.
2 Peter,2,5,"And during Noah's time, God did not have pity on the ungodly people of the world. He destroyed them with a flood, though he did save eight people, including Noah, who preached the truth."
2 Peter,2,6,"God punished the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by burning them to ashes, and this is a warning to anyone else who wants to sin."
2 Peter,3,1,"My dear friends, this is the second letter I have written to encourage you to do some honest thinking. I don't want you to forget"
2 Peter,3,2,what God's prophets said would happen. You must never forget what the holy prophets taught in the past. And you must remember what the apostles told you our Lord and Saviour has commanded us to do.
2 Peter,3,3,But first you must realize that in the last days some people won't think about anything except their own selfish desires. They will make fun of you
2 Peter,3,4,"and say, “Didn't your Lord promise to come back? Yet the first leaders have already died, and the world hasn't changed a bit.”"
2 Peter,3,5,They will say this because they want to forget that long ago the heavens and the earth were made at God's command. The earth came out of water and was made from water.
2 Peter,3,6,Later it was destroyed by the waters of a mighty flood.
2 Peter,3,7,"But God has commanded the present heavens and earth to remain until the day of judgment. Then they will be set on fire, and ungodly people will be destroyed."
2 Peter,3,8,"Dear friends, don't forget that for the Lord one day is the same as a thousand years, and a thousand years is the same as one day."
2 Peter,3,9,"The Lord isn't slow about keeping his promises, as some people think he is. In fact, God is patient, because he wants everyone to turn from sin and no one to be lost."
2 Peter,3,10,"The day of the Lord's return will surprise us like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a loud noise, and the heat will melt the whole universe. Then the earth and everything on it will be seen for what they are."
2 Peter,3,11,Everything will be destroyed. So you should serve and honour God by the way you live.
2 Peter,3,12,"You should look forward to the day when God judges everyone, and you should try to make it come soon. On that day the heavens will be destroyed by fire, and everything else will melt in the heat."
2 Peter,3,13,"But God has promised us a new heaven and a new earth, where justice will rule. We are really looking forward to that!"
2 Peter,3,14,"My friends, while you are waiting, you should make certain that the Lord finds you pure, spotless, and living at peace."
2 Peter,3,15,Don't forget that the Lord is patient because he wants people to be saved. This is also what our dear friend Paul said when he wrote to you with the wisdom that God had given him.
2 Peter,3,16,"Paul talks about these same things in all his letters, but part of what he says is hard to understand. Some ignorant and unsteady people even destroy themselves by twisting what he said. They do the same thing with other Scriptures too."
2 Peter,3,17,"My dear friends, you have been warned beforehand! So don't let the errors of evil people lead you down the wrong path and make you lose your balance."
2 Peter,3,18,Let the wonderful kindness and the understanding that come from our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ help you to keep on growing. Praise Jesus now and for ever! Amen.
1 John,1,1,"The Word that gives life was from the beginning, and this is the one our message is about. Our ears have heard, our own eyes have seen, and our hands touched this Word."
1 John,1,2,"The one who gives life appeared! We saw it happen, and we are witnesses to what we have seen. Now we are telling you about this eternal life that was with the Father and appeared to us."
1 John,1,3,"We are telling you what we have seen and heard, so that you may share in this life with us. And we share in it with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ."
1 John,1,4,"We are writing to tell you these things, because this makes us truly happy."
1 John,1,5,Jesus told us that God is light and doesn't have any darkness in him. Now we are telling you.
1 John,1,6,"If we say that we share in life with God and keep on living in the dark, we are lying and are not living by the truth."
1 John,1,7,"But if we live in the light, as God does, we share in life with each other. And the blood of his Son Jesus washes all our sins away."
1 John,1,8,"If we say that we have not sinned, we are fooling ourselves, and the truth isn't in our hearts."
1 John,1,9,"But if we confess our sins to God, he can always be trusted to forgive us and take our sins away."
1 John,1,10,"If we say that we have not sinned, we make God a liar, and his message isn't in our hearts."
1 John,2,1,"My children, I am writing this so that you won't sin. But if you do sin, Jesus Christ always does the right thing, and he will speak to the Father for us."
1 John,2,2,Christ is the sacrifice that takes away our sins and the sins of all the world's people.
1 John,2,3,"When we obey God, we are sure that we know him."
1 John,2,4,"But if we claim to know him and don't obey him, we are lying and the truth isn't in our hearts."
1 John,2,5,"We truly love God only when we obey him as we should, and then we know that we belong to him."
1 John,2,6,"If we say we are his, we must follow the example of Christ."
1 John,2,7,"My dear friends, I am not writing to give you a new commandment. It is the same one that you were first given, and it is the message you heard."
1 John,2,8,"But it really is a new commandment, and you know its true meaning, just as Christ does. You can see the darkness fading away and the true light already shining."
1 John,2,9,"If we claim to be in the light and hate someone, we are still in the dark."
1 John,2,10,"But if we love others, we are in the light, and we don't cause problems for them."
1 John,2,11,"If we hate others, we are living and walking in the dark. We don't know where we are going, because we can't see in the dark."
1 John,2,12,"Children, I am writing to you, because your sins have been forgiven in the name of Christ."
1 John,2,13,"Parents, I am writing to you, because you have known the one who was there from the beginning. Young people, I am writing to you, because you have defeated the evil one."
1 John,2,14,"Children, I am writing to you, because you have known the Father. Parents, I am writing to you, because you have known the one who was there from the beginning. Young people, I am writing to you, because you are strong. God's message is firm in your hearts, and you have defeated the evil one."
1 John,2,15,"Don't love the world or anything that belongs to the world. If you love the world, you cannot love the Father."
1 John,2,16,"Our foolish pride comes from this world, and so do our selfish desires and our desire to have everything we see. None of this comes from the Father."
1 John,2,17,"The world and the desires it causes are disappearing. But if we obey God, we will live for ever."
1 John,2,18,"Children, this is the last hour. You heard that the enemy of Christ would appear at this time, and many of Christ's enemies have already appeared. So we know that the last hour is here."
1 John,2,19,"These people came from our own group, yet they were not part of us. If they had been part of us, they would have stayed with us. But they left, which proves that they did not belong to our group."
1 John,2,20,"Christ, the Holy One, has blessed you, and now all of you understand."
1 John,2,21,"I did not need to write to you about the truth, since you already know it. You also know that liars do not belong to the truth."
1 John,2,22,And a liar is anyone who says that Jesus isn't truly Christ. Anyone who says this is an enemy of Christ and rejects both the Father and the Son.
1 John,2,23,"If we reject the Son, we reject the Father. But if we say that we accept the Son, we have the Father."
1 John,2,24,"Keep thinking about the message you first heard, and you will always be one in your heart with the Son and with the Father."
1 John,2,25,The Son has promised us eternal life.
1 John,2,26,I am writing to warn you about those people who are misleading you.
1 John,2,27,"But Christ has blessed you with the Holy Spirit. Now the Spirit stays in you, and you don't need any teachers. The Spirit is truthful and teaches you everything. So stay united in your heart with Christ, just as the Spirit has taught you to do."
1 John,2,28,"Children, stay united in your hearts with Christ. Then when he returns, we will have confidence and won't have to hide in shame."
1 John,2,29,You know that Christ always does right and that everyone who does right is a child of God.
1 John,3,1,"Think how much the Father loves us. He loves us so much that he lets us be called his children, as we truly are. But since the people of this world did not know who Christ is, they don't know who we are."
1 John,3,2,"My dear friends, we are already God's children, though what we will be hasn't yet been seen. But we do know that when Christ returns, we will be like him, because we will see him as he truly is."
1 John,3,3,"This hope makes us keep ourselves holy, just as Christ is holy."
1 John,3,4,"Everyone who sins breaks God's law, because sin is the same as breaking God's law."
1 John,3,5,"You know that Christ came to take away sins. He isn't sinful,"
1 John,3,6,"and people who stay united in their hearts with him won't keep on sinning. If they do keep on sinning, they don't know Christ, and they have never seen him."
1 John,3,7,"Children, don't be fooled. Anyone who does right is good, just like Christ himself."
1 John,3,8,"Anyone who keeps on sinning belongs to the devil. He has sinned from the beginning, but the Son of God came to destroy all that he has done."
1 John,3,9,"God's children cannot keep on being sinful. His life-giving power lives in them and makes them his children, so that they cannot keep on sinning."
1 John,3,10,"You can tell God's children from the devil's children, because those who belong to the devil refuse to do right or to love each other."
1 John,3,11,From the beginning you were told that we must love each other.
1 John,3,12,"Don't be like Cain, who belonged to the devil and murdered his own brother. Why did he murder him? He did it because his brother was good, and he was evil."
1 John,3,13,"My friends, don't be surprised if the people of this world hate you."
1 John,3,14,"Our love for each other proves that we have gone from death to life. But if you don't love each other, you are still under the power of death."
1 John,3,15,"If you hate each other, you are murderers, and we know that murderers do not have eternal life."
1 John,3,16,We know what love is because Jesus gave his life for us. That's why we must give our lives for each other.
1 John,3,17,"If we have all we need and see one of our own people in need, we must have pity on that person, or else we cannot say we love God."
1 John,3,18,"Children, you show love for others by truly helping them, and not merely by talking about it."
1 John,3,19,"When we love others, we know that we belong to the truth, and we feel at ease in the presence of God."
1 John,3,20,"But even if we don't feel at ease, God is greater than our feelings, and he knows everything."
1 John,3,21,"Dear friends, if we feel at ease in the presence of God, we will have the courage to come near him."
1 John,3,22,"He will give us whatever we ask, because we obey him and do what pleases him."
1 John,3,23,God wants us to have faith in his Son Jesus Christ and to love each other. This is also what Jesus taught us to do.
1 John,3,24,"If we obey God's commandments, we will stay united in our hearts with him, and he will stay united with us. The Spirit that he has given us is proof that we are one with him."
1 John,4,1,"Dear friends, don't believe everyone who claims to have the Spirit of God. Test them all to find out if they really do come from God. Many false prophets have already gone out into the world,"
1 John,4,2,and you can know which ones come from God. His Spirit says that Jesus Christ had a truly human body.
1 John,4,3,"But when someone doesn't say this about Jesus, you know that person has a spirit that doesn't come from God and is the enemy of Christ. You knew that this enemy was coming into the world and now is already here."
1 John,4,4,"Children, you belong to God, and you have defeated these enemies. God's Spirit is in you and is more powerful than the one that is in the world."
1 John,4,5,"These enemies belong to this world, and the world listens to them, because they speak its language."
1 John,4,6,"We belong to God, and everyone who knows God will listen to us. But the people who don't know God won't listen to us. That is how we can tell the Spirit that speaks the truth from the one that tells lies."
1 John,4,7,"My dear friends, we must love each other. Love comes from God, and when we love each other, it shows that we have been given new life. We are now God's children, and we know him."
1 John,4,8,"God is love, and anyone who doesn't love others has never known him."
1 John,4,9,God showed his love for us when he sent his only Son into the world to give us life.
1 John,4,10,"Real love isn't our love for God, but his love for us. God sent his Son to be the sacrifice by which our sins are forgiven."
1 John,4,11,"Dear friends, since God loved us this much, we must love each other."
1 John,4,12,"No one has ever seen God. But if we love each other, God lives in us, and his love is truly in our hearts."
1 John,4,13,"God has given us his Spirit. That is how we know that we are one with him, just as he is one with us."
1 John,4,14,God sent his Son to be the Saviour of the world. We saw his Son and are now telling others about him.
1 John,4,15,God stays united with everyone who openly says that Jesus is the Son of God. That's how we stay united with God
1 John,4,16,"and are sure that God loves us. God is love. If we keep on loving others, we will stay united in our hearts with God, and he will stay united with us."
1 John,4,17,"If we truly love others and live as Christ did in this world, we won't be worried about the day of judgment."
1 John,4,18,A real love for others will chase those worries away. The thought of being punished is what makes us afraid. It shows that we have not really learnt to love.
1 John,4,19,We love because God loved us first.
1 John,4,20,"But if we say we love God and don't love each other, we are liars. We cannot see God. So how can we love God, if we don't love the people we can see?"
1 John,4,21,The commandment that God has given us is: “Love God and love each other!”
1 John,5,1,"If we believe that Jesus is truly Christ, we are God's children. Everyone who loves the Father will also love his children."
1 John,5,2,"If we love and obey God, we know that we will love his children."
1 John,5,3,"We show our love for God by obeying his commandments, and they are not hard to follow."
1 John,5,4,"Every child of God can defeat the world, and our faith is what gives us this victory."
1 John,5,5,No one can defeat the world without having faith in Jesus as the Son of God.
1 John,5,6,"Water and blood came out from the side of Jesus Christ. It wasn't just water, but water and blood. The Spirit tells about this, because the Spirit is truthful."
1 John,5,7,"In fact, there are three who tell about it."
1 John,5,8,"They are the Spirit, the water, and the blood, and they all agree."
1 John,5,9,"We believe what people tell us. But we can trust what God says even more, and God is the one who has spoken about his Son."
1 John,5,10,"If we have faith in God's Son, we have believed what God has said. But if we don't believe what God has said about his Son, it is the same as calling God a liar."
1 John,5,11,God has also said that he gave us eternal life and that this life comes to us from his Son.
1 John,5,12,"And so, if we have God's Son, we have this life. But if we don't have the Son, we don't have this life."
1 John,5,13,"All of you have faith in the Son of God, and I have written to let you know that you have eternal life."
1 John,5,14,We are certain that God will hear our prayers when we ask for what pleases him.
1 John,5,15,"And if we know that God listens when we pray, we are sure that our prayers have already been answered."
1 John,5,16,"Suppose you see one of our people commit a sin that isn't a deadly sin. You can pray, and that person will be given eternal life. But the sin must not be one that is deadly."
1 John,5,17,"Everything that is wrong is sin, but not all sins are deadly."
1 John,5,18,"We are sure that God's children do not keep on sinning. God's own Son protects them, and the devil cannot harm them."
1 John,5,19,We are certain that we come from God and that the rest of the world is under the power of the devil.
1 John,5,20,"We know that Jesus Christ the Son of God has come and has shown us the true God. And because of Jesus, we now belong to the true God who gives eternal life."
1 John,5,21,"Children, you must stay away from idols."
2 John,1,1,"From the church leader. To a very special woman and her children. I truly love all of you, and so does everyone else who knows the truth."
2 John,1,2,"We love you because the truth is now in our hearts, and it will be there for ever."
2 John,1,3,I pray that God the Father and Jesus Christ his Son will be kind and merciful to us! May they give us peace and truth and love.
2 John,1,4,"I was very glad to learn that some of your children are obeying the truth, as the Father told us to do."
2 John,1,5,"Dear friend, I am not writing to tell you and your children to do something you have not done before. I am writing to tell you to love each other, which is the first thing you were told to do."
2 John,1,6,"Love means that we do what God tells us. And from the beginning, he told you to love him."
2 John,1,7,Many liars have gone out into the world. These deceitful liars are saying that Jesus Christ did not have a truly human body. But they are liars and the enemies of Christ.
2 John,1,8,"So be sure not to lose what we have worked for. If you do, you won't be given your full reward."
2 John,1,9,"Don't keep changing what you were taught about Christ, or else God will no longer be with you. But if you hold firmly to what you were taught, both the Father and the Son will be with you."
2 John,1,10,"If people won't agree to this teaching, don't welcome them into your home or even greet them."
2 John,1,11,Greeting them is the same as taking part in their evil deeds.
2 John,1,12,"I have much more to tell you, but I don't want to write it with pen and ink. I want to come and talk to you in person, because that will make us really happy."
2 John,1,13,Greetings from the children of your very special sister.
3 John,1,1,"From the church leader. To my dear friend Gaius. I love you because we follow the truth,"
3 John,1,2,"dear friend, and I pray that all goes well for you. I hope that you are as strong in body, as I know you are in spirit."
3 John,1,3,It makes me very happy when the Lord's followers come by and speak openly of how you obey the truth.
3 John,1,4,Nothing brings me greater happiness than to hear that my children are obeying the truth.
3 John,1,5,"Dear friend, you have always been faithful in helping other followers of the Lord, even the ones you didn't know before."
3 John,1,6,They have told the church about your love. They say you were good enough to welcome them and to send them on their mission in a way that God's servants deserve.
3 John,1,7,"When they left to tell others about the Lord, they decided not to accept help from anyone who wasn't a follower."
3 John,1,8,"We must support people like them, so that we can take part in what they are doing to spread the truth."
3 John,1,9,"I wrote to the church. But Diotrephes likes to be the number-one leader, and he won't pay any attention to us."
3 John,1,10,"So if I come, I will remind him of how he has been attacking us with gossip. Not only has he been doing this, but he refuses to welcome any of the Lord's followers who come by. And when other church members want to welcome them, he puts them out of the church."
3 John,1,11,"Dear friend, don't copy the evil deeds of others! Follow the example of people who do kind deeds. They are God's children, but those who are always doing evil have never seen God."
3 John,1,12,"Everyone speaks well of Demetrius, and so does the true message that he teaches. I also speak well of him, and you know what I say is true."
3 John,1,13,"I have much more to say to you, but I don't want to write it with pen and ink."
3 John,1,14,"I hope to see you soon, and then we can talk in person."
3 John,1,15,I pray that God will bless you with peace! Your friends send their greetings. Please give a personal greeting to each of our friends.
Jude,1,1,"From Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and the brother of James. To all who are chosen and loved by God the Father and are kept safe by Jesus Christ."
Jude,1,2,"I pray that God will greatly bless you with kindness, peace, and love!"
Jude,1,3,"My dear friends, I really wanted to write to you about God's saving power at work in our lives. But instead, I must write and ask you to defend the faith that God has once for all given to his people."
Jude,1,4,"Some godless people have sneaked in among us and are saying, “God treats us much better than we deserve, and so it is all right to be immoral.” They even deny that we must obey Jesus Christ as our only Master and Lord. But long ago the Scriptures warned that these godless people were doomed."
Jude,1,5,"Don't forget what happened to those people that the Lord rescued from Egypt. Some of them did not have faith, and he later destroyed them."
Jude,1,6,You also know about the angels who didn't do their work and left their proper places. God chained them with everlasting chains and is now keeping them in dark pits until the great day of judgment.
Jude,1,7,We should also be warned by what happened to the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and the nearby towns. Their people became immoral and did all sorts of sexual sins. Then God made an example of them and punished them with eternal fire.
Jude,1,8,The people I am talking about are behaving just like those dreamers who destroyed their own bodies. They reject all authority and insult angels.
Jude,1,9,"Even Michael, the chief angel, didn't dare to insult the devil, when the two of them were arguing about the body of Moses. All Michael said was, “The Lord will punish you!”"
Jude,1,10,"But these people insult powers they don't know anything about. They are like senseless animals that end up getting destroyed, because they live only by their feelings."
Jude,1,11,"Now they are in for real trouble. They have followed Cain's example and have made the same mistake that Balaam did by caring only for money. They have also rebelled against God, just as Korah did. Because of all this, they will be destroyed."
Jude,1,12,"These people are filthy minded, and by their shameful and selfish actions they spoil the meals you eat together. They are like clouds blown along by the wind, but never bringing any rain. They are like leafless trees, uprooted and dead, and unable to produce fruit."
Jude,1,13,Their shameful deeds show up like foam on wild ocean waves. They are like wandering stars for ever doomed to the darkest pits of hell.
Jude,1,14,"Enoch was the seventh person after Adam, and he was talking about these people when he said: Look! The Lord is coming with thousands and thousands of holy angels"
Jude,1,15,to judge everyone. He will punish all those ungodly people for all the evil things they have done. The Lord will punish those ungodly sinners for every evil thing they have ever said about him.
Jude,1,16,These people grumble and complain and live by their own selfish desires. They boast about themselves and flatter others to get what they want.
Jude,1,17,"My dear friends, remember the warning you were given by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ."
Jude,1,18,"They told you that near the end of time, selfish and godless people would start making fun of God."
Jude,1,19,"And now these people are already making you turn against each other. They think only about this life, and they don't have God's Spirit."
Jude,1,20,"Dear friends, keep building on the foundation of your most holy faith, as the Holy Spirit helps you to pray."
Jude,1,21,"And keep in step with God's love, as you wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to show how kind he is by giving you eternal life."
Jude,1,22,Be helpful to all who may have doubts.
Jude,1,23,"Rescue any who need to be saved, as you would rescue someone from a fire. Then with fear in your own hearts, have mercy on everyone who needs it. But hate even the clothes of those who have been made dirty by their filthy deeds."
Revelation,1,1,"This is what God showed to Jesus Christ, so that he could tell his servants what must happen soon. Christ then sent his angel with the message to his servant John."
Revelation,1,2,And John told everything that he had seen about God's message and about what Jesus Christ had said and done.
Revelation,1,3,"God will bless everyone who reads this prophecy to others, and he will bless everyone who hears and obeys it. The time is almost here."
Revelation,1,4,"From John to the seven churches in Asia. I pray that you will be blessed with kindness and peace from God, who is and was and is coming. May you receive kindness and peace from the seven spirits before the throne of God."
Revelation,1,5,"May kindness and peace be yours from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness. Jesus was the first to conquer death, and he is the ruler of all earthly kings. Christ loves us, and by his blood he set us free from our sins."
Revelation,1,6,He lets us rule as kings and serve God his Father as priests. To him be glory and power for ever and ever! Amen.
Revelation,1,7,"Look! He is coming with the clouds. Everyone will see him, even the ones who stuck a sword through him. All people on earth will weep because of him. Yes, it will happen! Amen."
Revelation,1,8,"The Lord God says, “I am Alpha and Omega, the one who is and was and is coming. I am God All-Powerful!”"
Revelation,1,9,"I am John, a follower together with all of you. We suffer because Jesus is our king, but he gives us the strength to endure. I was sent to Patmos Island, because I had preached God's message and had told about Jesus."
Revelation,1,10,"On the Lord's day the Spirit took control of me, and behind me I heard a loud voice that sounded like a trumpet."
Revelation,1,11,"The voice said, “Write in a book what you see. Then send it to the seven churches in Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.”"
Revelation,1,12,"When I turned to see who was speaking to me, I saw seven gold lampstands."
Revelation,1,13,"There with the lampstands was someone who seemed to be the Son of Man. He was wearing a robe that reached down to his feet, and a gold cloth was wrapped around his chest."
Revelation,1,14,"His head and his hair were white as wool or snow, and his eyes looked like flames of fire."
Revelation,1,15,"His feet were glowing like bronze being heated in a furnace, and his voice sounded like the roar of a waterfall."
Revelation,1,16,"He held seven stars in his right hand, and a sharp double-edged sword was coming from his mouth. His face was shining as bright as the sun at midday."
Revelation,1,17,"When I saw him, I fell at his feet like a dead person. But he put his right hand on me and said: Don't be afraid! I am the first, the last,"
Revelation,1,18,"and the living one. I died, but now I am alive for evermore, and I have the keys to death and the world of the dead."
Revelation,1,19,Write what you have seen and what is and what will happen after these things.
Revelation,1,20,"I will explain the mystery of the seven stars that you saw at my right side and the seven gold lampstands. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the lampstands are the seven churches."
Revelation,2,1,"This is what you must write to the angel of the church in Ephesus: I am the one who holds the seven stars in my right hand, and I walk among the seven gold lampstands. Listen to what I say."
Revelation,2,2,"I know everything you have done, including your hard work and how you have endured. I know you won't put up with anyone who is evil. When some people pretended to be apostles, you tested them and found out that they were liars."
Revelation,2,3,"You have endured and gone through hard times because of me, and you have not given up."
Revelation,2,4,But I do have something against you! And it is this: you don't have as much love as you used to.
Revelation,2,5,"Think about where you have fallen from, and then turn back and do as you did at first. If you don't turn back, I will come and take away your lampstand."
Revelation,2,6,"But there is one thing you are doing right. You hate what the Nicolaitans are doing, and so do I."
Revelation,2,7,"If you have ears, listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. I will let everyone who wins the victory eat from the life-giving tree in God's wonderful garden."
Revelation,2,8,"This is what you must write to the angel of the church in Smyrna: I am the first and the last. I died, but now I am alive! Listen to what I say."
Revelation,2,9,"I know how much you suffer and how poor you are, but you are rich. I also know the cruel things being said about you by people who claim to be Jews. But they are not really Jews. They are a group that belongs to Satan."
Revelation,2,10,"Don't worry about what you will suffer. The devil will throw some of you into jail, and you will be tested and made to suffer for ten days. But if you are faithful until you die, I will reward you with a glorious life."
Revelation,2,11,"If you have ears, listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. Whoever wins the victory will not be hurt by the second death."
Revelation,2,12,This is what you must write to the angel of the church in Pergamum: I am the one who has the sharp double-edged sword! Listen to what I say.
Revelation,2,13,"I know that you live where Satan has his throne. But you have kept true to my name. There where Satan lives, my faithful witness Antipas was taken from you and put to death. Even then you did not give up your faith in me."
Revelation,2,14,I do have a few things against you. Some of you are following the teaching of Balaam. Long ago he told Balak to teach the people of Israel to eat food that had been offered to idols and to be immoral.
Revelation,2,15,Now some of you are following the teaching of the Nicolaitans.
Revelation,2,16,"Turn back! If you don't, I will come quickly and fight against these people. And my words will cut like a sword."
Revelation,2,17,"If you have ears, listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. To everyone who wins the victory, I will give some of the hidden food. I will also give each one a white stone with a new name written on it. No one will know that name except the one who is given the stone."
Revelation,2,18,"This is what you must write to the angel of the church in Thyatira: I am the Son of God! My eyes are like flames of fire, and my feet are like bronze. Listen to what I say."
Revelation,2,19,"I know everything about you, including your love, your faith, your service, and how you have endured. I know that you are doing more now than you have ever done before."
Revelation,2,20,"But I still have something against you because of that woman Jezebel. She calls herself a prophet, and you let her teach and mislead my servants to do immoral things and to eat food offered to idols."
Revelation,2,21,"I gave her a chance to turn from her sins, but she did not want to stop doing these immoral things."
Revelation,2,22,"I am going to strike down Jezebel. Everyone who does these immoral things with her will also be punished, if they don't stop."
Revelation,2,23,I will even kill her followers. Then all the churches will see that I know everyone's thoughts and feelings. I will treat each of you as you deserve.
Revelation,2,24,Some of you in Thyatira don't follow Jezebel's teaching. You don't know anything about what her followers call the “deep secrets of Satan”. So I won't burden you down with any other commands.
Revelation,2,25,"But until I come, you must hold firmly to the teaching you have."
Revelation,2,26,I will give power over the nations to everyone who wins the victory and keeps on obeying me until the end.
Revelation,3,1,"This is what you must write to the angel of the church in Sardis: I have the seven spirits of God and the seven stars. Listen to what I say. I know what you are doing. Everyone may think you are alive, but you are dead."
Revelation,3,2,"Wake up! You have only a little strength left, and it is almost gone. So try to become stronger. I have found that you are not completely obeying God."
Revelation,3,3,"Remember the teaching that you were given and that you heard. Hold firmly to it and turn from your sins. If you don't wake up, I will come when you least expect it, just as a thief does."
Revelation,3,4,"A few of you in Sardis have not dirtied your clothes with sin. You will walk with me in white clothes, because you are worthy."
Revelation,3,5,"Everyone who wins the victory will wear white clothes. Their names will not be erased from the book of life, and I will tell my Father and his angels that they are my followers."
Revelation,3,6,"If you have ears, listen to what the Spirit says to the churches."
Revelation,3,7,"This is what you must write to the angel of the church in Philadelphia: I am the one who is holy and true, and I have the keys that belonged to David. When I open a door, no one can close it. And when I close a door, no one can open it. Listen to what I say."
Revelation,3,8,"I know everything you have done. And I have placed before you an open door that no one can close. You were not very strong, but you obeyed my message and did not deny that you are my followers."
Revelation,3,9,"Now you will see what I will do with those people who belong to Satan's group. They claim to be Jews, but they are liars. I will make them come and kneel down at your feet. Then they will know that I love you."
Revelation,3,10,You obeyed my message and endured. So I will protect you from the time of testing that everyone in all the world must go through.
Revelation,3,11,"I am coming soon. So hold firmly to what you have, and no one will take away the crown that you will be given as your reward."
Revelation,3,12,"Everyone who wins the victory will be made into a pillar in the temple of my God, and they will stay there for ever. I will write on each of them the name of my God and the name of his city. It is the new Jerusalem that my God will send down from heaven. I will also write on them my own new name."
Revelation,3,13,"If you have ears, listen to what the Spirit says to the churches."
Revelation,3,14,This is what you must write to the angel of the church in Laodicea: I am the one called Amen! I am the faithful and true witness and the source of God's creation. Listen to what I say.
Revelation,3,15,"I know everything you have done, and you are not cold or hot. I wish you were either one or the other."
Revelation,3,16,"But since you are lukewarm and neither cold nor hot, I will spit you out of my mouth."
Revelation,3,17,"You claim to be rich and successful and to have everything you need. But you don't know how badly off you are. You are pitiful, poor, blind, and naked."
Revelation,3,18,"Buy your gold from me. It has been refined in a fire, and it will make you rich. Buy white clothes from me. Wear them and you can cover-up your shameful nakedness. Buy medicine for your eyes, so that you will be able to see."
Revelation,3,19,I correct and punish everyone I love. So make up your minds to turn away from your sins.
Revelation,3,20,"Listen! I am standing and knocking at your door. If you hear my voice and open the door, I will come in and we will eat together."
Revelation,3,21,"Everyone who wins the victory will sit with me on my throne, just as I won the victory and sat with my Father on his throne."
Revelation,3,22,"If you have ears, listen to what the Spirit says to the churches."
Revelation,4,1,"After this, I looked and saw a door that opened into heaven. Then the voice that had spoken to me at first and that sounded like a trumpet said, “Come up here! I will show you what must happen next.”"
Revelation,4,2,"At once the Spirit took control of me, and there in heaven I saw a throne and someone sitting on it."
Revelation,4,3,The one who was sitting there sparkled like precious stones of jasper and carnelian. A rainbow that looked like an emerald surrounded the throne.
Revelation,4,4,Twenty-four other thrones were in a circle around that throne. And on each of these thrones there was an elder dressed in white clothes and wearing a gold crown.
Revelation,4,5,"Flashes of lightning and roars of thunder came out from the throne in the centre of the circle. Seven torches, which are the seven spirits of God, were burning in front of the throne."
Revelation,4,6,"Also in front of the throne was something that looked like a glass sea, clear as crystal. Around the throne in the centre were four living creatures covered front and back with eyes."
Revelation,4,7,"The first creature was like a lion, the second one was like a bull, the third one had the face of a human, and the fourth was like a flying eagle."
Revelation,4,8,"Each of the four living creatures had six wings, and their bodies were covered with eyes. Day and night they never stopped singing, “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord, the all-powerful God, who was and is and is coming!”"
Revelation,4,9,"The living creatures kept praising, honouring, and thanking the one who sits on the throne and who lives for ever and ever."
Revelation,4,10,"At the same time the twenty-four elders knelt down before the one sitting on the throne. And as they worshipped the one who lives for ever, they placed their crowns in front of the throne and said,"
Revelation,4,11,"“Our Lord and God, you are worthy to receive glory, honour, and power. You created all things, and by your decision they are and were created.”"
Revelation,5,1,In the right hand of the one sitting on the throne I saw a scroll that had writing on the inside and on the outside. And it was sealed in seven places.
Revelation,5,2,"I saw a mighty angel ask with a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?”"
Revelation,5,3,No one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or see inside it.
Revelation,5,4,I cried hard because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or see inside it.
Revelation,5,5,"Then one of the elders said to me, “Stop crying and look! The one who is called both the ‘Lion from the Tribe of Judah’ and ‘King David's Great Descendant’ has won the victory. He will open the book and its seven seals.”"
Revelation,5,6,"Then I looked and saw a Lamb standing in the centre of the throne that was surrounded by the four living creatures and the elders. The Lamb looked as if it had once been killed. It had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God, sent out to all the earth."
Revelation,5,7,The Lamb went over and took the scroll from the right hand of the one who sat on the throne.
Revelation,5,8,"After he had taken it, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders knelt down before him. Each of them had a harp and a gold bowl full of incense, which are the prayers of God's people."
Revelation,5,9,"Then they sang a new song, “You are worthy to receive the scroll and open its seals, because you were killed. And with your own blood you bought for God people from every tribe, language, nation, and race."
Revelation,5,10,"You let them become kings and serve God as priests, and they will rule on earth.”"
Revelation,5,11,"As I looked, I heard the voices of a lot of angels around the throne and the voices of the living creatures and of the elders. There were millions and millions of them,"
Revelation,5,12,"and they were saying in a loud voice, “The Lamb who was killed is worthy to receive power, riches, wisdom, strength, honour, glory, and praise.”"
Revelation,5,13,"Then I heard all beings in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and in the sea offer praise. Together, all of them were saying, “Praise, honour, glory, and strength for ever and ever to the one who sits on the throne and to the Lamb!”"
Revelation,5,14,"The four living creatures said “Amen”, while the elders knelt down and worshipped."
Revelation,6,1,"At the same time that I saw the Lamb open the first of the seven seals, I heard one of the four living creatures shout with a voice like thunder. It said, “Come out!”"
Revelation,6,2,"Then I saw a white horse. Its rider carried a bow and was given a crown. He had already won some victories, and he went out to win more."
Revelation,6,3,"When the Lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, “Come out!”"
Revelation,6,4,"Then another horse came out. It was fiery red. And its rider was given the power to take away all peace from the earth, so that people would slaughter one another. He was also given a big sword."
Revelation,6,5,"When the Lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, “Come out!” Then I saw a black horse, and its rider had a balance scale in one hand."
Revelation,6,6,"I heard what sounded like a voice from somewhere among the four living creatures. It said, “A litre of wheat will cost you a whole day's wages! Three litres of barley will cost you a day's wages too. But don't ruin the olive oil or the wine.”"
Revelation,6,7,"When the Lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, “Come out!”"
Revelation,6,8,"Then I saw a pale green horse. Its rider was named Death, and Death's Kingdom followed behind. They were given power over one fourth of the earth, and they could kill its people with swords, famines, diseases, and wild animals."
Revelation,6,9,"When the Lamb opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of everyone who had been killed for speaking God's message and telling about their faith."
Revelation,6,10,"They shouted, “Master, you are holy and faithful! How long will it be before you judge and punish the people of this earth who killed us?”"
Revelation,6,11,Then each of those who had been killed was given a white robe and told to rest for a little while. They had to wait until the complete number of the Lord's other servants and followers would be killed.
Revelation,6,12,"When I saw the Lamb open the sixth seal, I looked and saw a great earthquake. The sun turned as dark as sackcloth, and the moon became as red as blood."
Revelation,6,13,"The stars in the sky fell to earth, just like figs shaken loose by a storm."
Revelation,6,14,"Then the sky was rolled up like a scroll, and all mountains and islands were moved from their places."
Revelation,6,15,"The kings of the earth, its famous people, and its military leaders hid in caves or behind rocks on the mountains. They hid there together with the rich and the powerful and with all the slaves and free people."
Revelation,6,16,"Then they shouted to the mountains and the rocks, “Fall on us! Hide us from the one who sits on the throne and from the anger of the Lamb."
Revelation,6,17,"That terrible day has come! God and the Lamb will show their anger, and who can face it?”"
Revelation,8,1,"When the Lamb opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour."
Revelation,8,2,I noticed that the seven angels who stood before God were each given a trumpet.
Revelation,8,3,"Another angel, who had a gold container for incense, came and stood at the altar. This one was given a lot of incense to offer with the prayers of God's people on the gold altar in front of the throne."
Revelation,8,4,"Then the smoke of the incense, together with the prayers of God's people, went up to God from the hand of the angel."
Revelation,8,5,"After this, the angel filled the incense container with fire from the altar and threw it on the earth. Thunder roared, lightning flashed, and the earth shook."
Revelation,8,6,The seven angels now got ready to blow their trumpets.
Revelation,8,7,"When the first angel blew his trumpet, hail and fire mixed with blood were thrown down on the earth. A third of the earth, a third of the trees, and a third of all green plants were burnt."
Revelation,8,8,"When the second angel blew his trumpet, something like a great fiery mountain was thrown into the sea. A third of the sea turned to blood,"
Revelation,8,9,"a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed."
Revelation,8,10,"When the third angel blew his trumpet, a great star fell from heaven. It was burning like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on a third of the springs of water."
Revelation,8,11,"The name of the star was Bitter, and a third of the water turned bitter. Many people died because the water was so bitter."
Revelation,8,12,"When the fourth angel blew his trumpet, a third of the sun, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars were struck. They each lost a third of their light. So during a third of the day there was no light, and a third of the night was also without light."
Revelation,8,13,"Then I looked and saw a lone eagle flying across the sky. It was shouting, “Trouble, trouble, trouble to everyone who lives on earth! The other three angels are now going to blow their trumpets.”"
Revelation,9,1,"When the fifth angel blew his trumpet, I saw a star fall from the sky to earth. It was given the key to the tunnel that leads down to the deep pit."
Revelation,9,2,"As it opened the tunnel, smoke poured out like the smoke of a great furnace. The sun and the air turned dark because of the smoke."
Revelation,9,3,Locusts came out of the smoke and covered the earth. They were given the same power that scorpions have.
Revelation,9,4,The locusts were told not to harm the grass on the earth or any plant or any tree. They were to punish only those people who did not have God's mark on their foreheads.
Revelation,9,5,"The locusts were allowed to make them suffer for five months, but not to kill them. The suffering they caused was like the sting of a scorpion."
Revelation,9,6,"In those days people will want to die, but they will not be able to. They will hope for death, but it will escape from them."
Revelation,9,7,"These locusts looked like horses ready for battle. On their heads they wore something like gold crowns, and they had human faces."
Revelation,9,8,"Their hair was like a woman's long hair, and their teeth were like those of a lion."
Revelation,9,9,On their chests they wore armour made of iron. Their wings roared like an army of horse-drawn chariots rushing into battle.
Revelation,9,10,Their tails were like a scorpion's tail with a sting that had the power to hurt someone for five months.
Revelation,9,11,"Their king was the angel in charge of the deep pit. In Hebrew his name was Abaddon, and in Greek it was Apollyon."
Revelation,9,12,The first horrible thing has now happened! But wait. Two more horrible things will happen soon.
Revelation,9,13,Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet. I heard a voice speak from the four corners of the gold altar that stands in the presence of God.
Revelation,9,14,"The voice spoke to this angel and said, “Release the four angels who are tied up beside the great River Euphrates.”"
Revelation,9,15,The four angels had been prepared for this very hour and day and month and year. Now they were set free to kill a third of all people.
Revelation,9,16,"By listening, I could tell there were more than two hundred million of these war horses."
Revelation,9,17,"In my vision their riders wore fiery red, dark blue, and yellow armour on their chests. The heads of the horses looked like lions, with fire and smoke and sulphur coming out of their mouths."
Revelation,9,18,"One third of all people were killed by the three terrible troubles caused by the fire, the smoke, and the sulphur."
Revelation,9,19,"The horses had powerful mouths, and their tails were like poisonous snakes that bite and hurt."
Revelation,9,20,"The people who lived through these terrible troubles did not turn away from the idols they had made, and they did not stop worshipping demons. They kept on worshipping idols that were made of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood. Not one of these idols could see, hear, or walk."
Revelation,9,21,No one stopped murdering or practising witchcraft or being immoral or stealing.
Revelation,10,1,"I saw another powerful angel come down from heaven. This one was covered with a cloud, and a rainbow was over his head. His face was like the sun, his legs were like columns of fire,"
Revelation,10,2,and with his hand he held a little scroll that had been unrolled. He stood there with his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land.
Revelation,10,3,Then he shouted with a voice that sounded like a growling lion. Thunder roared seven times.
Revelation,10,4,"After the thunder stopped, I was about to write what it had said. But a voice from heaven shouted, “Keep it secret! Don't write these things.”"
Revelation,10,5,The angel I had seen standing on the sea and the land then held his right hand up towards heaven.
Revelation,10,6,"He made a promise in the name of God who lives for ever and who created heaven, earth, the sea, and every living creature. The angel said, “You won't have to wait any longer."
Revelation,10,7,"God told his secret plans to his servants the prophets, and it will all happen by the time the seventh angel sounds his trumpet.”"
Revelation,10,8,"Once again the voice from heaven spoke to me. It said, “Go and take the open scroll from the hand of the angel standing on the sea and the land.”"
Revelation,10,9,"When I went over to ask the angel for the little scroll, the angel said, “Take the scroll and eat it! Your stomach will turn sour, but the taste in your mouth will be as sweet as honey.”"
Revelation,10,10,"I took the little scroll from the hand of the angel and ate it. The taste was as sweet as honey, but my stomach turned sour."
Revelation,10,11,"Then some voices said, “Keep on telling what will happen to the people of many nations, races, and languages, and also to kings.”"
Revelation,11,1,An angel gave me a measuring stick and said: Measure around God's temple. Be sure to include the altar and everyone worshipping there.
Revelation,11,2,"But don't measure the courtyard outside the temple building. Leave it out. It has been given to those people who don't know God, and they will trample all over the holy city for forty-two months."
Revelation,11,3,"My two witnesses will wear sackcloth, while I let them preach for one thousand two hundred and sixty days."
Revelation,11,4,These two witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand in the presence of the Lord who rules the earth.
Revelation,11,5,Any enemy who tries to harm them will be destroyed by the fire that comes out of their mouths.
Revelation,11,6,"They have the power to lock up the sky and to keep rain from falling while they are prophesying. And whenever they want to, they can turn water to blood and cause all kinds of terrible troubles on earth."
Revelation,11,7,"After the two witnesses have finished preaching God's message, the beast that lives in the deep pit will come up and fight against them. It will win the battle and kill them."
Revelation,11,8,Their bodies will be left lying in the streets of the same great city where their Lord was nailed to a cross. And that city is spiritually like the city of Sodom or the country of Egypt.
Revelation,11,9,"For three and a half days the people of every nation, tribe, language, and race will stare at the bodies of these two witnesses and refuse to let them be buried."
Revelation,11,10,"Everyone on earth will celebrate and be happy. They will give gifts to each other, because of what happened to the two prophets who caused them so much trouble."
Revelation,11,11,"But three and a half days later, God will breathe life into their bodies. They will stand up, and everyone who sees them will be terrified."
Revelation,11,12,"The witnesses then heard a loud voice from heaven, saying, “Come up here.” And while their enemies were watching, they were taken up to heaven in a cloud."
Revelation,11,13,"At that same moment there was a terrible earthquake that destroyed a tenth of the city. Seven thousand people were killed, and the rest were frightened and praised the God who rules in heaven."
Revelation,11,14,The second horrible thing has now happened! But the third one will be here soon.
Revelation,11,15,"At the sound of the seventh trumpet, loud voices were heard in heaven. They said, “Now the kingdom of this world belongs to our Lord and to his Chosen One! And he will rule for ever and ever!”"
Revelation,11,16,"Then the twenty-four elders, who were seated on thrones in God's presence, knelt down and worshipped him."
Revelation,11,17,"They said, “Lord God All-Powerful, you are and you were, and we thank you. You used your great power and started ruling."
Revelation,11,18,"When the nations got angry, you became angry too! Now the time has come for the dead to be judged. It is time for you to reward your servants the prophets and all your people who honour your name, no matter who they are. It is time to destroy everyone who has destroyed the earth.”"
Revelation,11,19,"The door to God's temple in heaven was then opened, and the sacred chest could be seen inside the temple. I saw lightning and heard roars of thunder. The earth trembled and huge hailstones fell to the ground."
Revelation,12,1,"Something important appeared in the sky. It was a woman whose clothes were the sun. The moon was under her feet, and a crown made of twelve stars was on her head."
Revelation,12,2,"She was about to give birth, and she was crying because of the great pain."
Revelation,12,3,"Something else appeared in the sky. It was a huge red dragon with seven heads and ten horns, and a crown on each of its seven heads."
Revelation,12,4,"With its tail, it dragged a third of the stars from the sky and threw them down to the earth. Then the dragon turned towards the woman, because it wanted to eat her child as soon as it was born."
Revelation,12,5,"The woman gave birth to a son, who would rule all nations with an iron rod. The boy was snatched away. He was taken to God and placed on his throne."
Revelation,12,6,The woman ran into the desert to a place that God had prepared for her. There she would be taken care of for one thousand two hundred and sixty days.
Revelation,12,7,A war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels were fighting against the dragon and its angels.
Revelation,12,8,But the dragon lost the battle. It and its angels were forced out of their places in heaven
Revelation,12,9,"and were thrown down to the earth. Yes, that old snake and his angels were thrown out of heaven! That snake, who fools everyone on earth, is known as the devil and Satan."
Revelation,12,10,"Then I heard a voice from heaven shout, “Our God has shown his saving power, and his kingdom has come! God's own Chosen One has shown his authority. Satan accused our people in the presence of God day and night. Now he has been thrown out!"
Revelation,12,11,Our people defeated Satan because of the blood of the Lamb and the message of God. They were willing to give up their lives.
Revelation,12,12,"The heavens should rejoice, together with everyone who lives there. But pity the earth and the sea, because the devil was thrown down to the earth. He knows his time is short, and he is very angry.”"
Revelation,12,13,"When the dragon realized that it had been thrown down to the earth, it tried to make trouble for the woman who had given birth to a son."
Revelation,12,14,"But the woman was given two wings like those of a huge eagle, so that she could fly into the desert. There she would escape from the snake and be taken care of for a time, two times, and half a time."
Revelation,12,15,The snake then spewed out water like a river to sweep the woman away.
Revelation,12,16,But the earth helped her and swallowed the water that had come from the dragon's mouth.
Revelation,12,17,This made the dragon terribly angry with the woman. So it started a war against the rest of her children. They are the people who obey God and are faithful to what Jesus did and taught.
Revelation,12,18,The dragon stood on the beach beside the sea.
Revelation,13,1,"I looked and saw a beast coming up from the sea. This one had ten horns and seven heads, and a crown was on each of its ten horns. On each of its heads were names that were an insult to God."
Revelation,13,2,"The beast that I saw had the body of a leopard, the feet of a bear, and the mouth of a lion. The dragon handed over its own power and throne and great authority to this beast."
Revelation,13,3,"One of its heads seemed to have been fatally wounded, but now it was well. Everyone on earth marvelled at this beast,"
Revelation,13,4,"and they worshipped the dragon who had given its authority to the beast. They also worshipped the beast and said, “No one is like this beast! No one can fight against it.”"
Revelation,13,5,"The beast was allowed to boast and claim to be God, and for forty-two months it was allowed to rule."
Revelation,13,6,"The beast cursed God, and it cursed the name of God. It even cursed the place where God lives, as well as everyone who lives in heaven with God."
Revelation,13,7,"It was allowed to fight against God's people and defeat them. It was also given authority over the people of every tribe, nation, language, and race."
Revelation,13,8,The beast was worshipped by everyone whose name wasn't written before the time of creation in the book of the Lamb who was killed.
Revelation,13,9,"If you have ears, then listen!"
Revelation,13,10,"If you are doomed to be captured, you will be captured. If you are doomed to be killed by a sword, you will be killed by a sword. This means that God's people must learn to endure and be faithful!"
Revelation,13,11,"I now saw another beast. This one came out of the ground. It had two horns like a lamb, but spoke like a dragon."
Revelation,13,12,It worked for the beast whose fatal wound had been healed. And it used all its authority to force the earth and its people to worship that beast.
Revelation,13,13,"It performed mighty miracles, and while people watched, it even made fire come down from the sky."
Revelation,13,14,This second beast fooled people on earth by performing miracles for the first one. Then it talked them into making an idol in the form of the beast that did not die after being wounded by a sword.
Revelation,13,15,"It was allowed to put breath into the idol, so that it could speak. Everyone who refused to worship the idol of the beast was put to death."
Revelation,13,16,"All people were forced to put a mark on their right hand or forehead. Whether they were powerful or weak, rich or poor, free people or slaves,"
Revelation,13,17,"they all had to have this mark, or else they could not buy or sell anything. This mark stood for the name of the beast and for the number of its name."
Revelation,13,18,"You need wisdom to understand the number of the beast! But if you are clever enough, you can work this out. Its number is six hundred and sixty-six, and it stands for a person."
Revelation,14,1,"I looked and saw the Lamb standing on Mount Zion! With him were a hundred and forty-four thousand, who had his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads."
Revelation,14,2,Then I heard a sound from heaven that was like a roaring flood or loud thunder or even like the music of harps.
Revelation,14,3,"And a new song was being sung in front of God's throne and in front of the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn that song, except the one hundred and forty-four thousand who had been rescued from the earth."
Revelation,14,4,"All these are pure virgins, and they follow the Lamb wherever he leads. They have been rescued to be presented to God and the Lamb as the most precious people on earth."
Revelation,14,5,"They never tell lies, and they are innocent."
Revelation,14,6,"I saw another angel. This one was flying across the sky and had the eternal good news to announce to the people of every race, tribe, language, and nation on earth."
Revelation,14,7,"The angel shouted, “Worship and honour God! The time has come for him to judge everyone. Kneel down before the one who created heaven and earth, the oceans, and every stream.”"
Revelation,14,8,"A second angel followed and said, “The great city of Babylon has fallen! This is the city that made all nations drunk and immoral. Now God is angry, and Babylon has fallen.”"
Revelation,14,9,"Finally, a third angel came and shouted: Here is what will happen if you worship the beast and the idol and have the mark of the beast on your hand or forehead."
Revelation,14,10,"You will have to drink the wine that God gives to everyone who makes him angry. You will feel his mighty anger, and you will be tortured with fire and burning sulphur, while the holy angels and the Lamb look on."
Revelation,14,11,"If you worship the beast and the idol and accept the mark of its name, you will be tortured day and night. The smoke from your torture will go up for ever and ever, and you will never be able to rest."
Revelation,14,12,God's people must learn to endure. They must also obey his commands and have faith in Jesus.
Revelation,14,13,"Then I heard a voice from heaven say, “Put this in writing. From now on, the Lord will bless everyone who has faith in him when they die.” The Spirit answered, “Yes, they will rest from their hard work, and they will be rewarded for what they have done.”"
Revelation,14,14,"I looked and saw a bright cloud, and someone who seemed to be the Son of Man was sitting on the cloud. He wore a gold crown on his head and held a sharp sickle in his hand."
Revelation,14,15,"An angel came out of the temple and shouted, “Start cutting with your sickle! Harvest season is here, and all crops on earth are ripe.”"
Revelation,14,16,The one on the cloud swung his sickle and harvested the crops.
Revelation,14,17,Another angel with a sharp sickle then came out of the temple in heaven.
Revelation,14,18,"After this, an angel with power over fire came from the altar and shouted to the angel who had the sickle. He said, “All grapes on earth are ripe! Harvest them with your sharp sickle.”"
Revelation,14,19,The angel swung his sickle on earth and cut off its grapes. He threw them into a pit where they were trampled on as a sign of God's anger.
Revelation,14,20,"The pit was outside the city, and when the grapes were squashed, blood flowed out. The blood turned into a river that was about three hundred kilometres long and almost deep enough to cover a horse."
Revelation,15,1,"After this, I looked at the sky and saw something else that was strange and important. Seven angels were bringing the last seven terrible troubles. When these are ended, God will no longer be angry."
Revelation,15,2,"Then I saw something that looked like a glass sea mixed with fire, and people were standing on it. They were the ones who had defeated the beast and the idol and the number that tells the name of the beast. God had given them harps,"
Revelation,15,3,"and they were singing the song that his servant Moses and the Lamb had sung. They were singing, “Lord God All-Powerful, you have done great and marvellous things. You are the ruler of all nations, and you do what is right and fair."
Revelation,15,4,"Lord, who doesn't honour and praise your name? You alone are holy, and all nations will come and worship you, because you have shown that you judge with fairness.”"
Revelation,15,5,"After this, I noticed something else in heaven. The sacred tent used for a temple was open."
Revelation,15,6,And the seven angels who were bringing the terrible troubles were coming out of it. They were dressed in robes of pure white linen and wore belts made of pure gold.
Revelation,15,7,One of the four living creatures gave each of the seven angels a bowl made of gold. These bowls were filled with the anger of God who lives for ever and ever.
Revelation,15,8,The temple quickly filled with smoke from the glory and power of God. No one could enter it until the seven angels had finished pouring out the seven last troubles.
Revelation,16,1,"From the temple I heard a voice shout to the seven angels, “Go and empty the seven bowls of God's anger on the earth.”"
Revelation,16,2,The first angel emptied his bowl on the earth. At once ugly and painful sores broke out on everyone who had the mark of the beast and worshipped the idol.
Revelation,16,3,"The second angel emptied his bowl on the sea. Straight away the sea turned into blood like that of a dead person, and every living thing in the sea died."
Revelation,16,4,The third angel emptied his bowl into the rivers and streams. At once they turned to blood.
Revelation,16,5,"Then I heard the angel, who has power over water, say, “You have always been, and you always will be the holy God. You had the right to judge in this way."
Revelation,16,6,"They poured out the blood of your people and your prophets. So you gave them blood to drink, as they deserve!”"
Revelation,16,7,"After this, I heard the altar shout, “Yes, Lord God All-Powerful, your judgments are honest and fair.”"
Revelation,16,8,"The fourth angel emptied his bowl on the sun, and it began to scorch people like fire."
Revelation,16,9,"Everyone was scorched by its great heat, and all of them cursed the name of God who had power over these terrible troubles. But no one turned to God and praised him."
Revelation,16,10,"The fifth angel emptied his bowl on the throne of the beast. At once darkness covered its kingdom, and its people began biting their tongues in pain."
Revelation,16,11,"And because of their painful sores, they cursed the God who rules in heaven. But still they did not stop doing evil things."
Revelation,16,12,"The sixth angel emptied his bowl on the great River Euphrates, and it completely dried up to make a road for the kings from the east."
Revelation,16,13,"An evil spirit that looked like a frog came out of the mouth of the dragon. One also came out of the mouth of the beast, and another out of the mouth of the false prophet."
Revelation,16,14,"These evil spirits had the power to perform miracles. They went to every king on earth, to bring them together for a war against God All-Powerful. But that will be the day of God's great victory."
Revelation,16,15,"Remember that Christ says, “When I come, it will surprise you like a thief! But God will bless you, if you are awake and ready. Then you won't have to walk around naked and be ashamed.”"
Revelation,16,16,Those armies came together in a place that in Hebrew is called Armagedon.
Revelation,16,17,"As soon as the seventh angel emptied his bowl in the air, a loud voice from the throne in the temple shouted, “It's done!”"
Revelation,16,18,"There were flashes of lightning, roars of thunder, and the worst earthquake in all history."
Revelation,16,19,"The great city of Babylon split into three parts, and the cities of other nations fell. So God made Babylon drink from the wine cup that was filled with his anger."
Revelation,16,20,"Every island ran away, and the mountains disappeared."
Revelation,16,21,"Hailstones, weighing about fifty kilogrammes each, fell from the sky on people. Finally, the people cursed God, because the hail was so terrible."
Revelation,17,1,"One of the seven angels who had emptied the bowls came over and said to me, “Come on! I will show you how God will punish that shameless prostitute who sits on many oceans."
Revelation,17,2,"Every king on earth has slept with her, and her shameless ways are like wine that has made everyone on earth drunk.”"
Revelation,17,3,"With the help of the Spirit, the angel took me into the desert, where I saw a woman sitting on a red beast. The beast was covered with names that were an insult to God, and it had seven heads and ten horns."
Revelation,17,4,"The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet robes, and she wore jewellery made of gold, precious stones, and pearls. In her hand she held a gold cup filled with the filthy and nasty things she had done."
Revelation,17,5,"On her forehead a mysterious name was written: I AM THE GREAT CITY OF BABYLON, THE MOTHER OF EVERY IMMORAL AND FILTHY THING ON EARTH."
Revelation,17,6,"I could tell that the woman was drunk on the blood of God's people who had given their lives for Jesus. This surprising sight amazed me,"
Revelation,17,7,"and the angel said: Why are you so amazed? I will explain the mystery about this woman and about the beast she is sitting on, with its seven heads and ten horns."
Revelation,17,8,"The beast you saw is one that used to be and no longer is. It will come back from the deep pit, but only to be destroyed. Everyone on earth whose names were not written in the book of life before the time of creation will be amazed. They will see this beast that used to be and no longer is, but will be once more."
Revelation,17,9,Anyone with wisdom can work this out. The seven heads that the woman is sitting on stand for seven hills. These heads are also seven kings.
Revelation,17,10,"Five of the kings are dead. One is ruling now, and the other one has not yet come. But when he does, he will rule for only a little while."
Revelation,17,11,"You also saw a beast that used to be and no longer is. That beast is one of the seven kings who will return as the eighth king, but only to be destroyed."
Revelation,17,12,"The ten horns that you saw are ten more kings, who have not yet come into power, and they will rule with the beast for only a short time."
Revelation,17,13,They all think alike and will give their power and authority to the beast.
Revelation,17,14,"These kings will go to war against the Lamb. But he will defeat them, because he is Lord over all lords and King over all kings. His followers are chosen and special and faithful."
Revelation,17,15,The oceans that you saw the prostitute sitting on are crowds of people from all races and languages.
Revelation,17,16,The ten horns and the beast will start hating the shameless woman. They will strip off her clothes and leave her naked. Then they will eat her flesh and throw the rest of her body into a fire.
Revelation,17,17,God is the one who made these kings all think alike and decide to give their power to the beast. And they will do this until what God has said comes true.
Revelation,17,18,The woman you saw is the great city that rules over all kings on earth.
Revelation,18,1,"I saw another angel come from heaven. This one had great power, and the earth was bright because of his glory."
Revelation,18,2,"The angel shouted, “Fallen! Powerful Babylon has fallen and is now the home of demons. It is the den of every filthy spirit and of all unclean birds, and every dirty and hated animal."
Revelation,18,3,"Babylon's evil and immoral wine has made all nations drunk. Every king on earth has slept with her, and every merchant on earth is rich because of her evil desires.”"
Revelation,18,4,"Then I heard another voice from heaven shout, “My people, you must escape from Babylon. Don't take part in her sins and share her punishment."
Revelation,18,5,Her sins are piled as high as heaven. God has remembered the evil she has done.
Revelation,18,6,Treat her as she has treated others. Make her pay double for what she has done. Make her drink twice as much of what she mixed for others.
Revelation,18,7,"That woman honoured herself with a life of luxury. Reward her now with suffering and pain. “Deep in her heart Babylon said, ‘I am the queen! Never will I be a widow or know what it means to be sad.’"

Revelation,18,9,"Every king on earth who slept with her and shared in her luxury will mourn. They will weep, when they see the smoke from that fire."

Revelation,18,16,"Then they shouted, “Pity the great city of Babylon! She dressed in fine linen and wore purple and scarlet cloth. She had jewellery made of gold and precious stones and pearls."

Revelation,19,1,"After this, I heard what sounded like a lot of voices in heaven, and they were shouting, “Praise the Lord! To our God belongs the glorious power to save,"
Revelation,19,2,because his judgments are honest and fair. That filthy prostitute ruined the earth with shameful deeds. But God has judged her and made her pay the price for murdering his servants.”

Revelation,19,10,"I knelt at the feet of the angel and began to worship him. But the angel said, “Don't do that! I am a servant, just like you and everyone else who tells about Jesus. Don't worship anyone but God. Everyone who tells about Jesus does it by the power of the Spirit.”"
Revelation,19,11,"I looked and saw that heaven was open, and a white horse was there. Its rider was called Faithful and True, and he is always fair when he judges or goes to war."
Revelation,19,12,"He had eyes like flames of fire, and he was wearing a lot of crowns. His name was written on him, but he was the only one who knew what the name meant."
Revelation,19,13,"The rider wore a robe that was covered with blood, and he was known as “The Word of God”."
Revelation,19,14,He was followed by armies from heaven that rode on horses and were dressed in pure white linen.
Revelation,19,15,From his mouth a sharp sword went out to attack the nations. He will rule them with an iron rod and will show the fierce anger of God All-Powerful by trampling on the grapes in the pit where wine is made.

Revelation,19,20,"But the beast was captured and so was the false prophet. This is the same prophet who had performed miracles for the beast, so that he could fool everyone who had the mark of the beast and worshipped the idol. The beast and the false prophet were thrown alive into a lake of burning sulphur."
Revelation,19,21,But the rest of their army was killed by the sword that came from the mouth of the rider on the horse. Then birds stuffed themselves on the dead bodies.
Revelation,20,1,"I saw an angel come down from heaven, carrying the key to the deep pit and a big chain."

Revelation,20,4,"I saw thrones, and sitting on those thrones were the ones who had been given the right to judge. I also saw the souls of the people who had their heads cut off because they had told about Jesus and preached God's message. They were the same ones who had not worshipped the beast or the idol, and they had refused to let its mark be put on their hands or foreheads. They will come to life and rule with Christ for a thousand years."

Revelation,21,11,The glory of God made the city bright. It was dazzling and crystal clear like a precious jasper stone.
Revelation,21,12,"The city had a high and thick wall with twelve gates, and each one of them was guarded by an angel. On each of the gates was written the name of one of the twelve tribes of Israel."
