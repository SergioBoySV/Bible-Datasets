1 Chronicles,19,2,"David said, “I will deal loyally with Hanun son of Nahash, for his father dealt loyally with me.” So David sent messengers to console him concerning his father. When David's servants came to Hanun in the land of the Ammonites, to console him,"
1 Chronicles,19,3,"the officials of the Ammonites said to Hanun, “Do you think, because David has sent consolers to you, that he is honoring your father? Have not his servants come to you to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land?”"
1 Chronicles,19,4,"So Hanun seized David's servants, shaved them, cut off their garments in the middle at their hips, and sent them away;"
1 Chronicles,19,5,"and they departed. When David was told about the men, he sent messengers to them, for they felt greatly humiliated. The king said, “Remain at Jericho until your beards have grown, and then return.”"
1 Chronicles,19,6,"When the Ammonites saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent a thousand talents of silver to hire chariots and cavalry from Mesopotamia, from Aram-maacah and from Zobah."
1 Chronicles,19,7,"They hired thirty-two thousand chariots and the king of Maacah with his army, who came and camped before Medeba. And the Ammonites were mustered from their cities and came to battle."
1 Chronicles,19,8,"When David heard of it, he sent Joab and all the army of the warriors."
1 Chronicles,19,9,"The Ammonites came out and drew up in battle array at the entrance of the city, and the kings who had come were by themselves in the open country."
1 Chronicles,19,10,"When Joab saw that the line of battle was set against him both in front and in the rear, he chose some of the picked men of Israel and arrayed them against the Arameans;"
1 Chronicles,19,11,"the rest of his troops he put in the charge of his brother Abishai, and they were arrayed against the Ammonites."
1 Chronicles,19,12,"He said, “If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will help you."
1 Chronicles,19,13,"Be strong, and let us be courageous for our people and for the cities of our God; and may the Lord do what seems good to him.”"
1 Chronicles,19,14,So Joab and the troops who were with him advanced toward the Arameans for battle; and they fled before him.
1 Chronicles,19,15,"When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans fled, they likewise fled before Abishai, Joab's brother, and entered the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem."
1 Chronicles,19,16,"But when the Arameans saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they sent messengers and brought out the Arameans who were beyond the Euphrates, with Shophach the commander of the army of Hadadezer at their head."
1 Chronicles,19,17,"When David was informed, he gathered all Israel together, crossed the Jordan, came to them, and drew up his forces against them. When David set the battle in array against the Arameans, they fought with him."
1 Chronicles,19,18,"The Arameans fled before Israel; and David killed seven thousand Aramean charioteers and forty thousand foot soldiers, and also killed Shophach the commander of their army."
1 Chronicles,19,19,"When the servants of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with David, and became subject to him. So the Arameans were not willing to help the Ammonites any more."
1 Chronicles,20,1,"In the spring of the year, the time when kings go out to battle, Joab led out the army, ravaged the country of the Ammonites, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David remained at Jerusalem. Joab attacked Rabbah, and overthrew it."
1 Chronicles,20,2,"David took the crown of Milcom from his head; he found that it weighed a talent of gold, and in it was a precious stone; and it was placed on David's head. He also brought out the booty of the city, a very great amount."
1 Chronicles,20,3,"He brought out the people who were in it, and set them to work with saws and iron picks and axes. Thus David did to all the cities of the Ammonites. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem."
1 Chronicles,20,4,"After this, war broke out with the Philistines at Gezer; then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, who was one of the descendants of the giants; and the Philistines were subdued."
1 Chronicles,20,5,"Again there was war with the Philistines; and Elhanan son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver's beam."
1 Chronicles,20,6,"Again there was war at Gath, where there was a man of great size, who had six fingers on each hand, and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in number; he also was descended from the giants."
1 Chronicles,20,7,"When he taunted Israel, Jonathan son of Shimea, David's brother, killed him."
1 Chronicles,20,8,These were descended from the giants in Gath; they fell by the hand of David and his servants.
1 Chronicles,21,1,"Satan stood up against Israel, and incited David to count the people of Israel."
1 Chronicles,21,2,"So David said to Joab and the commanders of the army, “Go, number Israel, from Beer-sheba to Dan, and bring me a report, so that I may know their number.”"
1 Chronicles,21,3,"But Joab said, “May the Lord increase the number of his people a hundredfold! Are they not, my lord the king, all of them my lord's servants? Why then should my lord require this? Why should he bring guilt on Israel?”"
1 Chronicles,21,4,"But the king's word prevailed against Joab. So Joab departed and went throughout all Israel, and came back to Jerusalem."
1 Chronicles,21,5,"Joab gave the total count of the people to David. In all Israel there were one million one hundred thousand men who drew the sword, and in Judah four hundred seventy thousand who drew the sword."
1 Chronicles,21,6,"But he did not include Levi and Benjamin in the numbering, for the king's command was abhorrent to Joab."
1 Chronicles,21,7,"But God was displeased with this thing, and he struck Israel."
1 Chronicles,21,8,"David said to God, “I have sinned greatly in that I have done this thing. But now, I pray you, take away the guilt of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.”"
1 Chronicles,21,9,"The Lord spoke to Gad, David's seer, saying,"
1 Chronicles,21,10,"“Go and say to David, ‘Thus says the Lord : Three things I offer you; choose one of them, so that I may do it to you.’ ”"
1 Chronicles,21,11,"So Gad came to David and said to him, “Thus says the Lord , ‘Take your choice:"
1 Chronicles,21,12,"either three years of famine; or three months of devastation by your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtakes you; or three days of the sword of the Lord , pestilence on the land, and the angel of the Lord destroying throughout all the territory of Israel.’ Now decide what answer I shall return to the one who sent me.”"
1 Chronicles,21,13,"Then David said to Gad, “I am in great distress; let me fall into the hand of the Lord , for his mercy is very great; but let me not fall into human hands.”"
1 Chronicles,21,14,So the Lord sent a pestilence on Israel; and seventy thousand persons fell in Israel.
1 Chronicles,21,15,"And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it; but when he was about to destroy it, the Lord took note and relented concerning the calamity; he said to the destroying angel, “Enough! Stay your hand.” The angel of the Lord was then standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite."
1 Chronicles,21,16,"David looked up and saw the angel of the Lord standing between earth and heaven, and in his hand a drawn sword stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces."
1 Chronicles,21,17,"And David said to God, “Was it not I who gave the command to count the people? It is I who have sinned and done very wickedly. But these sheep, what have they done? Let your hand, I pray, O Lord my God, be against me and against my father's house; but do not let your people be plagued!”"
1 Chronicles,21,18,Then the angel of the Lord commanded Gad to tell David that he should go up and erect an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
1 Chronicles,21,19,"So David went up following Gad's instructions, which he had spoken in the name of the Lord."
1 Chronicles,21,20,"Ornan turned and saw the angel; and while his four sons who were with him hid themselves, Ornan continued to thresh wheat."
1 Chronicles,21,21,"As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David; he went out from the threshing floor, and did obeisance to David with his face to the ground."
1 Chronicles,21,22,"David said to Ornan, “Give me the site of the threshing floor that I may build on it an altar to the Lord —give it to me at its full price—so that the plague may be averted from the people.”"
1 Chronicles,21,23,"Then Ornan said to David, “Take it; and let my lord the king do what seems good to him; see, I present the oxen for burnt offerings, and the threshing sledges for the wood, and the wheat for a grain offering. I give it all.”"
1 Chronicles,21,24,"But King David said to Ornan, “No; I will buy them for the full price. I will not take for the Lord what is yours, nor offer burnt offerings that cost me nothing.”"
1 Chronicles,21,25,So David paid Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the site.
1 Chronicles,21,26,"David built there an altar to the Lord and presented burnt offerings and offerings of well-being. He called upon the Lord , and he answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering."
1 Chronicles,21,27,"Then the Lord commanded the angel, and he put his sword back into its sheath."
1 Chronicles,21,28,"At that time, when David saw that the Lord had answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he made his sacrifices there."
1 Chronicles,21,29,"For the tabernacle of the Lord , which Moses had made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering were at that time in the high place at Gibeon;"
1 Chronicles,21,30,"but David could not go before it to inquire of God, for he was afraid of the sword of the angel of the Lord."
1 Chronicles,22,1,"Then David said, “Here shall be the house of the Lord God and here the altar of burnt offering for Israel.”"
1 Chronicles,22,2,"David gave orders to gather together the aliens who were residing in the land of Israel, and he set stonecutters to prepare dressed stones for building the house of God."
1 Chronicles,22,3,"David also provided great stores of iron for nails for the doors of the gates and for clamps, as well as bronze in quantities beyond weighing,"
1 Chronicles,22,4,and cedar logs without number—for the Sidonians and Tyrians brought great quantities of cedar to David.
1 Chronicles,22,5,"For David said, “My son Solomon is young and inexperienced, and the house that is to be built for the Lord must be exceedingly magnificent, famous and glorified throughout all lands; I will therefore make preparation for it.” So David provided materials in great quantity before his death."
1 Chronicles,22,6,"Then he called for his son Solomon and charged him to build a house for the Lord , the God of Israel."
1 Chronicles,22,7,"David said to Solomon, “My son, I had planned to build a house to the name of the Lord my God."
1 Chronicles,22,8,"But the word of the Lord came to me, saying, ‘You have shed much blood and have waged great wars; you shall not build a house to my name, because you have shed so much blood in my sight on the earth."
1 Chronicles,22,9,"See, a son shall be born to you; he shall be a man of peace. I will give him peace from all his enemies on every side; for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quiet to Israel in his days."
1 Chronicles,22,10,"He shall build a house for my name. He shall be a son to me, and I will be a father to him, and I will establish his royal throne in Israel forever.’"
1 Chronicles,22,11,"Now, my son, the Lord be with you, so that you may succeed in building the house of the Lord your God, as he has spoken concerning you."
1 Chronicles,22,12,"Only, may the Lord grant you discretion and understanding, so that when he gives you charge over Israel you may keep the law of the Lord your God."
1 Chronicles,22,13,Then you will prosper if you are careful to observe the statutes and the ordinances that the Lord commanded Moses for Israel. Be strong and of good courage. Do not be afraid or dismayed.
1 Chronicles,22,14,"With great pains I have provided for the house of the Lord one hundred thousand talents of gold, one million talents of silver, and bronze and iron beyond weighing, for there is so much of it; timber and stone too I have provided. To these you must add more."
1 Chronicles,22,15,"You have an abundance of workers: stonecutters, masons, carpenters, and all kinds of artisans without number, skilled in working"
1 Chronicles,22,16,"gold, silver, bronze, and iron. Now begin the work, and the Lord be with you.”"
1 Chronicles,22,17,"David also commanded all the leaders of Israel to help his son Solomon, saying,"
1 Chronicles,22,18,“Is not the Lord your God with you? Has he not given you peace on every side? For he has delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before the Lord and his people.
1 Chronicles,22,19,Now set your mind and heart to seek the Lord your God. Go and build the sanctuary of the Lord God so that the ark of the covenant of the Lord and the holy vessels of God may be brought into a house built for the name of the Lord .”
1 Chronicles,23,1,"When David was old and full of days, he made his son Solomon king over Israel."
1 Chronicles,23,2,David assembled all the leaders of Israel and the priests and the Levites.
1 Chronicles,23,3,"The Levites, thirty years old and upward, were counted, and the total was thirty-eight thousand."
1 Chronicles,23,4,"“Twenty-four thousand of these,” David said, “shall have charge of the work in the house of the Lord , six thousand shall be officers and judges,"
1 Chronicles,23,5,"four thousand gatekeepers, and four thousand shall offer praises to the Lord with the instruments that I have made for praise.”"

1 Chronicles,23,11,"Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second; but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, so they were enrolled as a single family."
1 Chronicles,23,12,"The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four."
1 Chronicles,23,13,"The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. Aaron was set apart to consecrate the most holy things, so that he and his sons forever should make offerings before the Lord , and minister to him and pronounce blessings in his name forever;"
1 Chronicles,23,14,"but as for Moses the man of God, his sons were to be reckoned among the tribe of Levi."

1 Chronicles,23,24,"These were the sons of Levi by their ancestral houses, the heads of families as they were enrolled according to the number of the names of the individuals from twenty years old and upward who were to do the work for the service of the house of the Lord."
1 Chronicles,23,25,"For David said, “The Lord , the God of Israel, has given rest to his people; and he resides in Jerusalem forever."
1 Chronicles,23,26,And so the Levites no longer need to carry the tabernacle or any of the things for its service”—
1 Chronicles,23,27,for according to the last words of David these were the number of the Levites from twenty years old and upward—
1 Chronicles,23,28,"“but their duty shall be to assist the descendants of Aaron for the service of the house of the Lord , having the care of the courts and the chambers, the cleansing of all that is holy, and any work for the service of the house of God;"
1 Chronicles,23,29,"to assist also with the rows of bread, the choice flour for the grain offering, the wafers of unleavened bread, the baked offering, the offering mixed with oil, and all measures of quantity or size."

1 Chronicles,24,2,"But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no sons; so Eleazar and Ithamar became the priests."
1 Chronicles,24,3,"Along with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, David organized them according to the appointed duties in their service."
1 Chronicles,24,4,"Since more chief men were found among the sons of Eleazar than among the sons of Ithamar, they organized them under sixteen heads of ancestral houses of the sons of Eleazar, and eight of the sons of Ithamar."
1 Chronicles,24,5,"They organized them by lot, all alike, for there were officers of the sanctuary and officers of God among both the sons of Eleazar and the sons of Ithamar."
