Lamentations,1,1,"How lonely sits the city that once was full of people! How like a widow she has become, she that was great among the nations! She that was a princess among the provinces has become a vassal."
Lamentations,1,2,"She weeps bitterly in the night, with tears on her cheeks; among all her lovers she has no one to comfort her; all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they have become her enemies."
Lamentations,1,3,"Judah has gone into exile with suffering and hard servitude; she lives now among the nations, and finds no resting place; her pursuers have all overtaken her in the midst of her distress."
Lamentations,1,4,"The roads to Zion mourn, for no one comes to the festivals; all her gates are desolate, her priests groan; her young girls grieve, and her lot is bitter."
Lamentations,1,5,"Her foes have become the masters, her enemies prosper, because the Lord has made her suffer for the multitude of her transgressions; her children have gone away, captives before the foe."
Lamentations,1,6,From daughter Zion has departed all her majesty. Her princes have become like stags that find no pasture; they fled without strength before the pursuer.
Lamentations,1,7,"Jerusalem remembers, in the days of her affliction and wandering, all the precious things that were hers in days of old. When her people fell into the hand of the foe, and there was no one to help her, the foe looked on mocking over her downfall."
Lamentations,1,8,"Jerusalem sinned grievously, so she has become a mockery; all who honored her despise her, for they have seen her nakedness; she herself groans, and turns her face away."
Lamentations,1,9,"Her uncleanness was in her skirts; she took no thought of her future; her downfall was appalling, with none to comfort her. “O Lord , look at my affliction, for the enemy has triumphed!”"
Lamentations,1,10,"Enemies have stretched out their hands over all her precious things; she has even seen the nations invade her sanctuary, those whom you forbade to enter your congregation."
Lamentations,1,11,"All her people groan as they search for bread; they trade their treasures for food to revive their strength. Look, O Lord , and see how worthless I have become."
Lamentations,1,12,"Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by? Look and see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow, which was brought upon me, which the Lord inflicted on the day of his fierce anger."
Lamentations,1,13,"From on high he sent fire; it went deep into my bones; he spread a net for my feet; he turned me back; he has left me stunned, faint all day long."
Lamentations,1,14,"My transgressions were bound into a yoke; by his hand they were fastened together; they weigh on my neck, sapping my strength; the Lord handed me over to those whom I cannot withstand."
Lamentations,1,15,The Lord has rejected all my warriors in the midst of me; he proclaimed a time against me to crush my young men; the Lord has trodden as in a wine press the virgin daughter Judah.
Lamentations,1,16,"For these things I weep; my eyes flow with tears; for a comforter is far from me, one to revive my courage; my children are desolate, for the enemy has prevailed."
Lamentations,1,17,"Zion stretches out her hands, but there is no one to comfort her; the Lord has commanded against Jacob that his neighbors should become his foes; Jerusalem has become a filthy thing among them."
Lamentations,1,18,"The Lord is in the right, for I have rebelled against his word; but hear, all you peoples, and behold my suffering; my young women and young men have gone into captivity."
Lamentations,1,19,I called to my lovers but they deceived me; my priests and elders perished in the city while seeking food to revive their strength.
Lamentations,1,20,"See, O Lord , how distressed I am; my stomach churns, my heart is wrung within me, because I have been very rebellious. In the street the sword bereaves; in the house it is like death."
Lamentations,1,21,"They heard how I was groaning, with no one to comfort me. All my enemies heard of my trouble; they are glad that you have done it. Bring on the day you have announced, and let them be as I am."
Lamentations,1,22,Let all their evil doing come before you; and deal with them as you have dealt with me because of all my transgressions; for my groans are many and my heart is faint.
Lamentations,2,1,How the Lord in his anger has humiliated daughter Zion! He has thrown down from heaven to earth the splendor of Israel; he has not remembered his footstool in the day of his anger.
Lamentations,2,2,The Lord has destroyed without mercy all the dwellings of Jacob; in his wrath he has broken down the strongholds of daughter Judah; he has brought down to the ground in dishonor the kingdom and its rulers.
Lamentations,2,3,"He has cut down in fierce anger all the might of Israel; he has withdrawn his right hand from them in the face of the enemy; he has burned like a flaming fire in Jacob, consuming all around."
Lamentations,2,4,"He has bent his bow like an enemy, with his right hand set like a foe; he has killed all in whom we took pride in the tent of daughter Zion; he has poured out his fury like fire."
Lamentations,2,5,"The Lord has become like an enemy; he has destroyed Israel; He has destroyed all its palaces, laid in ruins its strongholds, and multiplied in daughter Judah mourning and lamentation."
Lamentations,2,6,"He has broken down his booth like a garden, he has destroyed his tabernacle; the Lord has abolished in Zion festival and sabbath, and in his fierce indignation has spurned king and priest."
Lamentations,2,7,"The Lord has scorned his altar, disowned his sanctuary; he has delivered into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; a clamor was raised in the house of the Lord as on a day of festival."
Lamentations,2,8,The Lord determined to lay in ruins the wall of daughter Zion; he stretched the line; he did not withhold his hand from destroying; he caused rampart and wall to lament; they languish together.
Lamentations,2,9,"Her gates have sunk into the ground; he has ruined and broken her bars; her king and princes are among the nations; guidance is no more, and her prophets obtain no vision from the Lord."
Lamentations,2,10,The elders of daughter Zion sit on the ground in silence; they have thrown dust on their heads and put on sackcloth; the young girls of Jerusalem have bowed their heads to the ground.
Lamentations,2,11,"My eyes are spent with weeping; my stomach churns; my bile is poured out on the ground because of the destruction of my people, because infants and babes faint in the streets of the city."
Lamentations,2,12,"They cry to their mothers, “Where is bread and wine?” as they faint like the wounded in the streets of the city, as their life is poured out on their mothers' bosom."
Lamentations,2,13,"What can I say for you, to what compare you, O daughter Jerusalem? To what can I liken you, that I may comfort you, O virgin daughter Zion? For vast as the sea is your ruin; who can heal you?"
Lamentations,2,14,"Your prophets have seen for you false and deceptive visions; they have not exposed your iniquity to restore your fortunes, but have seen oracles for you that are false and misleading."
Lamentations,2,15,"All who pass along the way clap their hands at you; they hiss and wag their heads at daughter Jerusalem; “Is this the city that was called the perfection of beauty, the joy of all the earth?”"
Lamentations,2,16,"All your enemies open their mouths against you; they hiss, they gnash their teeth, they cry: “We have devoured her! Ah, this is the day we longed for; at last we have seen it!”"
Lamentations,2,17,"The Lord has done what he purposed, he has carried out his threat; as he ordained long ago, he has demolished without pity; he has made the enemy rejoice over you, and exalted the might of your foes."
Lamentations,2,18,"Cry aloud to the Lord! O wall of daughter Zion! Let tears stream down like a torrent day and night! Give yourself no rest, your eyes no respite!"
Lamentations,2,19,"Arise, cry out in the night, at the beginning of the watches! Pour out your heart like water before the presence of the Lord! Lift your hands to him for the lives of your children, who faint for hunger at the head of every street."
Lamentations,2,20,"Look, O Lord , and consider! To whom have you done this? Should women eat their offspring, the children they have borne? Should priest and prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord?"
Lamentations,2,21,"The young and the old are lying on the ground in the streets; my young women and my young men have fallen by the sword; in the day of your anger you have killed them, slaughtering without mercy."
Lamentations,2,22,You invited my enemies from all around as if for a day of festival; and on the day of the anger of the Lord no one escaped or survived; those whom I bore and reared my enemy has destroyed.
Lamentations,3,1,I am one who has seen affliction under the rod of God's wrath;
Lamentations,3,2,he has driven and brought me into darkness without any light;
Lamentations,3,3,"against me alone he turns his hand, again and again, all day long."
Lamentations,3,4,"He has made my flesh and my skin waste away, and broken my bones;"
Lamentations,3,5,he has besieged and enveloped me with bitterness and tribulation;
Lamentations,3,6,he has made me sit in darkness like the dead of long ago.
Lamentations,3,7,He has walled me about so that I cannot escape; he has put heavy chains on me;
Lamentations,3,8,"though I call and cry for help, he shuts out my prayer;"
Lamentations,3,9,"he has blocked my ways with hewn stones, he has made my paths crooked."
Lamentations,3,10,"He is a bear lying in wait for me, a lion in hiding;"
Lamentations,3,11,he led me off my way and tore me to pieces; he has made me desolate;
Lamentations,3,12,he bent his bow and set me as a mark for his arrow.
Lamentations,3,13,He shot into my vitals the arrows of his quiver;
Lamentations,3,14,"I have become the laughingstock of all my people, the object of their taunt-songs all day long."
Lamentations,3,15,"He has filled me with bitterness, he has sated me with wormwood."
Lamentations,3,16,"He has made my teeth grind on gravel, and made me cower in ashes;"
Lamentations,3,17,my soul is bereft of peace; I have forgotten what happiness is;
Lamentations,3,18,"so I say, “Gone is my glory, and all that I had hoped for from the Lord .”"
Lamentations,3,19,The thought of my affliction and my homelessness is wormwood and gall!
Lamentations,3,20,My soul continually thinks of it and is bowed down within me.
Lamentations,3,21,"But this I call to mind, and therefore I have hope:"
Lamentations,3,22,"The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases, his mercies never come to an end;"
Lamentations,3,23,they are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.
Lamentations,3,24,"“The Lord is my portion,” says my soul, “therefore I will hope in him.”"
Lamentations,3,25,"The Lord is good to those who wait for him, to the soul that seeks him."
Lamentations,3,26,It is good that one should wait quietly for the salvation of the Lord.
Lamentations,3,27,"It is good for one to bear the yoke in youth,"
Lamentations,3,28,"to sit alone in silence when the Lord has imposed it,"
Lamentations,3,29,"to put one's mouth to the dust (there may yet be hope),"
Lamentations,3,30,"to give one's cheek to the smiter, and be filled with insults."
Lamentations,3,31,For the Lord will not reject forever.
Lamentations,3,32,"Although he causes grief, he will have compassion according to the abundance of his steadfast love;"
Lamentations,3,33,for he does not willingly afflict or grieve anyone.
Lamentations,3,34,"When all the prisoners of the land are crushed under foot,"
Lamentations,3,35,"when human rights are perverted in the presence of the Most High,"
Lamentations,3,36,when one's case is subverted —does the Lord not see it?
Lamentations,3,37,"Who can command and have it done, if the Lord has not ordained it?"
Lamentations,3,38,Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that good and bad come?
Lamentations,3,39,Why should any who draw breath complain about the punishment of their sins?

Lamentations,3,42,"We have transgressed and rebelled, and you have not forgiven."
Lamentations,3,43,"You have wrapped yourself with anger and pursued us, killing without pity;"
Lamentations,3,44,you have wrapped yourself with a cloud so that no prayer can pass through.
Lamentations,3,45,You have made us filth and rubbish among the peoples.
Lamentations,3,46,All our enemies have opened their mouths against us;
Lamentations,3,47,"panic and pitfall have come upon us, devastation and destruction."
Lamentations,3,48,My eyes flow with rivers of tears because of the destruction of my people.
Lamentations,3,49,"My eyes will flow without ceasing, without respite,"
Lamentations,3,50,until the Lord from heaven looks down and sees.
Lamentations,3,51,My eyes cause me grief at the fate of all the young women in my city.
Lamentations,3,52,Those who were my enemies without cause have hunted me like a bird;
Lamentations,3,53,they flung me alive into a pit and hurled stones on me;
Lamentations,3,54,"water closed over my head; I said, “I am lost.”"
Lamentations,3,55,"I called on your name, O Lord, from the depths of the pit;"
Lamentations,3,56,"you heard my plea, “Do not close your ear to my cry for help, but give me relief!”"
Lamentations,3,57,"You came near when I called on you; you said, “Do not fear!”"
Lamentations,3,58,"You have taken up my cause, O Lord, you have redeemed my life."
Lamentations,3,59,"You have seen the wrong done to me, O Lord; judge my cause."
Lamentations,3,60,"You have seen all their malice, all their plots against me."
Lamentations,3,61,"You have heard their taunts, O Lord, all their plots against me."
Lamentations,3,62,The whispers and murmurs of my assailants are against me all day long.
Lamentations,3,63,"Whether they sit or rise—see, I am the object of their taunt-songs."
Lamentations,3,64,"Pay them back for their deeds, O Lord, according to the work of their hands!"
Lamentations,3,65,Give them anguish of heart; your curse be on them!
Lamentations,3,66,Pursue them in anger and destroy them from under the Lord 's heavens.
Lamentations,4,1,"How the gold has grown dim, how the pure gold is changed! The sacred stones lie scattered at the head of every street."
Lamentations,4,2,"The precious children of Zion, worth their weight in fine gold— how they are reckoned as earthen pots, the work of a potter's hands!"
Lamentations,4,3,"Even the jackals offer the breast and nurse their young, but my people has become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness."
Lamentations,4,4,"The tongue of the infant sticks to the roof of its mouth for thirst; the children beg for food, but no one gives them anything."
Lamentations,4,5,Those who feasted on delicacies perish in the streets; those who were brought up in purple cling to ash heaps.
Lamentations,4,6,"For the chastisement of my people has been greater than the punishment of Sodom, which was overthrown in a moment, though no hand was laid on it."
Lamentations,4,7,"Her princes were purer than snow, whiter than milk; their bodies were more ruddy than coral, their hair like sapphire."

Lamentations,4,9,"Happier were those pierced by the sword than those pierced by hunger, whose life drains away, deprived of the produce of the field."

Lamentations,4,15,"“Away! Unclean!” people shouted at them; “Away! Away! Do not touch!” So they became fugitives and wanderers; it was said among the nations, “They shall stay here no longer.”"
Lamentations,4,16,"The Lord himself has scattered them, he will regard them no more; no honor was shown to the priests, no favor to the elders."
Lamentations,4,17,"Our eyes failed, ever watching vainly for help; we were watching eagerly for a nation that could not save."
Lamentations,4,18,They dogged our steps so that we could not walk in our streets; our end drew near; our days were numbered; for our end had come.
Lamentations,4,19,"Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles in the heavens; they chased us on the mountains, they lay in wait for us in the wilderness."

Lamentations,5,13,"Young men are compelled to grind, and boys stagger under loads of wood."
Lamentations,5,14,"The old men have left the city gate, the young men their music."

Lamentations,5,16,"The crown has fallen from our head; woe to us, for we have sinned!"
Lamentations,5,17,"Because of this our hearts are sick, because of these things our eyes have grown dim:"
Lamentations,5,18,"because of Mount Zion, which lies desolate; jackals prowl over it."
Lamentations,5,19,"But you, O Lord , reign forever; your throne endures to all generations."
Lamentations,5,20,Why have you forgotten us completely? Why have you forsaken us these many days?
Lamentations,5,21,"Restore us to yourself, O Lord , that we may be restored; renew our days as of old—"
Lamentations,5,22,"unless you have utterly rejected us, and are angry with us beyond measure."
