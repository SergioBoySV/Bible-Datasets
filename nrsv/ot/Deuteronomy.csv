Deuteronomy,1,1,"These are the words that Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan—in the wilderness, on the plain opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Di-zahab."
Deuteronomy,1,2,(By the way of Mount Seir it takes eleven days to reach Kadesh-barnea from Horeb.)
Deuteronomy,1,3,"In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses spoke to the Israelites just as the Lord had commanded him to speak to them."
Deuteronomy,1,4,"This was after he had defeated King Sihon of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, and King Og of Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei."
Deuteronomy,1,5,"Beyond the Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses undertook to expound this law as follows:"
Deuteronomy,1,6,"The Lord our God spoke to us at Horeb, saying, “You have stayed long enough at this mountain."
Deuteronomy,1,7,"Resume your journey, and go into the hill country of the Amorites as well as into the neighboring regions—the Arabah, the hill country, the Shephelah, the Negeb, and the seacoast—the land of the Canaanites and the Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates."
Deuteronomy,1,8,"See, I have set the land before you; go in and take possession of the land that I swore to your ancestors, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to them and to their descendants after them.”"
Deuteronomy,1,9,"At that time I said to you, “I am unable by myself to bear you."
Deuteronomy,1,10,"The Lord your God has multiplied you, so that today you are as numerous as the stars of heaven."
Deuteronomy,1,11,"May the Lord , the God of your ancestors, increase you a thousand times more and bless you, as he has promised you!"
Deuteronomy,1,12,But how can I bear the heavy burden of your disputes all by myself?
Deuteronomy,1,13,"Choose for each of your tribes individuals who are wise, discerning, and reputable to be your leaders.”"
Deuteronomy,1,14,"You answered me, “The plan you have proposed is a good one.”"
Deuteronomy,1,15,"So I took the leaders of your tribes, wise and reputable individuals, and installed them as leaders over you, commanders of thousands, commanders of hundreds, commanders of fifties, commanders of tens, and officials, throughout your tribes."
Deuteronomy,1,16,"I charged your judges at that time: “Give the members of your community a fair hearing, and judge rightly between one person and another, whether citizen or resident alien."
Deuteronomy,1,17,"You must not be partial in judging: hear out the small and the great alike; you shall not be intimidated by anyone, for the judgment is God's. Any case that is too hard for you, bring to me, and I will hear it.”"
Deuteronomy,1,18,So I charged you at that time with all the things that you should do.
Deuteronomy,1,19,"Then, just as the Lord our God had ordered us, we set out from Horeb and went through all that great and terrible wilderness that you saw, on the way to the hill country of the Amorites, until we reached Kadesh-barnea."
Deuteronomy,1,20,"I said to you, “You have reached the hill country of the Amorites, which the Lord our God is giving us."
Deuteronomy,1,21,"See, the Lord your God has given the land to you; go up, take possession, as the Lord , the God of your ancestors, has promised you; do not fear or be dismayed.”"
Deuteronomy,1,22,"All of you came to me and said, “Let us send men ahead of us to explore the land for us and bring back a report to us regarding the route by which we should go up and the cities we will come to.”"
Deuteronomy,1,23,"The plan seemed good to me, and I selected twelve of you, one from each tribe."
Deuteronomy,1,24,"They set out and went up into the hill country, and when they reached the Valley of Eshcol they spied it out"
Deuteronomy,1,25,"and gathered some of the land's produce, which they brought down to us. They brought back a report to us, and said, “It is a good land that the Lord our God is giving us.”"
Deuteronomy,1,26,But you were unwilling to go up. You rebelled against the command of the Lord your God;
Deuteronomy,1,27,"you grumbled in your tents and said, “It is because the Lord hates us that he has brought us out of the land of Egypt, to hand us over to the Amorites to destroy us."
Deuteronomy,1,28,"Where are we headed? Our kindred have made our hearts melt by reporting, ‘The people are stronger and taller than we; the cities are large and fortified up to heaven! We actually saw there the offspring of the Anakim!’ ”"
Deuteronomy,1,29,"I said to you, “Have no dread or fear of them."
Deuteronomy,1,30,"The Lord your God, who goes before you, is the one who will fight for you, just as he did for you in Egypt before your very eyes,"
Deuteronomy,1,31,"and in the wilderness, where you saw how the Lord your God carried you, just as one carries a child, all the way that you traveled until you reached this place."
Deuteronomy,1,32,"But in spite of this, you have no trust in the Lord your God,"
Deuteronomy,1,33,"who goes before you on the way to seek out a place for you to camp, in fire by night, and in the cloud by day, to show you the route you should take.”"
Deuteronomy,1,34,"When the Lord heard your words, he was wrathful and swore:"
Deuteronomy,1,35,"“Not one of these—not one of this evil generation—shall see the good land that I swore to give to your ancestors,"
Deuteronomy,1,36,"except Caleb son of Jephunneh. He shall see it, and to him and to his descendants I will give the land on which he set foot, because of his complete fidelity to the Lord .”"
Deuteronomy,1,37,"Even with me the Lord was angry on your account, saying, “You also shall not enter there."
Deuteronomy,1,38,"Joshua son of Nun, your assistant, shall enter there; encourage him, for he is the one who will secure Israel's possession of it."
Deuteronomy,1,39,"And as for your little ones, who you thought would become booty, your children, who today do not yet know right from wrong, they shall enter there; to them I will give it, and they shall take possession of it."
Deuteronomy,1,40,"But as for you, journey back into the wilderness, in the direction of the Red Sea.”"
Deuteronomy,1,41,"You answered me, “We have sinned against the Lord ! We are ready to go up and fight, just as the Lord our God commanded us.” So all of you strapped on your battle gear, and thought it easy to go up into the hill country."
Deuteronomy,1,42,"The Lord said to me, “Say to them, ‘Do not go up and do not fight, for I am not in the midst of you; otherwise you will be defeated by your enemies.’ ”"
Deuteronomy,1,43,"Although I told you, you would not listen. You rebelled against the command of the Lord and presumptuously went up into the hill country."
Deuteronomy,1,44,The Amorites who lived in that hill country then came out against you and chased you as bees do. They beat you down in Seir as far as Hormah.
Deuteronomy,1,45,"When you returned and wept before the Lord , the Lord would neither heed your voice nor pay you any attention."
Deuteronomy,1,46,"After you had stayed at Kadesh as many days as you did,"
Deuteronomy,2,1,"we journeyed back into the wilderness, in the direction of the Red Sea, as the Lord had told me and skirted Mount Seir for many days."
Deuteronomy,2,2,Then the Lord said to me:
Deuteronomy,2,3,"“You have been skirting this hill country long enough. Head north,"
Deuteronomy,2,4,"and charge the people as follows: You are about to pass through the territory of your kindred, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. They will be afraid of you, so, be very careful"
Deuteronomy,2,5,"not to engage in battle with them, for I will not give you even so much as a foot's length of their land, since I have given Mount Seir to Esau as a possession."
Deuteronomy,2,6,"You shall purchase food from them for money, so that you may eat; and you shall also buy water from them for money, so that you may drink."
Deuteronomy,2,7,Surely the Lord your God has blessed you in all your undertakings; he knows your going through this great wilderness. These forty years the Lord your God has been with you; you have lacked nothing.”
Deuteronomy,2,8,"So we passed by our kin, the descendants of Esau who live in Seir, leaving behind the route of the Arabah, and leaving behind Elath and Ezion-geber. When we had headed out along the route of the wilderness of Moab,"
Deuteronomy,2,9,"the Lord said to me: “Do not harass Moab or engage them in battle, for I will not give you any of its land as a possession, since I have given Ar as a possession to the descendants of Lot.”"
Deuteronomy,2,10,"(The Emim—a large and numerous people, as tall as the Anakim—had formerly inhabited it."
Deuteronomy,2,11,"Like the Anakim, they are usually reckoned as Rephaim, though the Moabites call them Emim."
Deuteronomy,2,12,"Moreover, the Horim had formerly inhabited Seir, but the descendants of Esau dispossessed them, destroying them and settling in their place, as Israel has done in the land that the Lord gave them as a possession.)"
Deuteronomy,2,13,"“Now then, proceed to cross over the Wadi Zered.” So we crossed over the Wadi Zered."
Deuteronomy,2,14,"And the length of time we had traveled from Kadesh-barnea until we crossed the Wadi Zered was thirty-eight years, until the entire generation of warriors had perished from the camp, as the Lord had sworn concerning them."
Deuteronomy,2,15,"Indeed, the Lord 's own hand was against them, to root them out from the camp, until all had perished."
Deuteronomy,2,16,"Just as soon as all the warriors had died off from among the people,"
Deuteronomy,2,17,"the Lord spoke to me, saying,"
Deuteronomy,2,18,“Today you are going to cross the boundary of Moab at Ar.
Deuteronomy,2,19,"When you approach the frontier of the Ammonites, do not harass them or engage them in battle, for I will not give the land of the Ammonites to you as a possession, because I have given it to the descendants of Lot.”"
Deuteronomy,2,20,"(It also is usually reckoned as a land of Rephaim. Rephaim formerly inhabited it, though the Ammonites call them Zamzummim,"
Deuteronomy,2,21,"a strong and numerous people, as tall as the Anakim. But the Lord destroyed them from before the Ammonites so that they could dispossess them and settle in their place."
Deuteronomy,2,22,"He did the same for the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir, by destroying the Horim before them so that they could dispossess them and settle in their place even to this day."
Deuteronomy,2,23,"As for the Avvim, who had lived in settlements in the vicinity of Gaza, the Caphtorim, who came from Caphtor, destroyed them and settled in their place.)"
Deuteronomy,2,24,"“Proceed on your journey and cross the Wadi Arnon. See, I have handed over to you King Sihon the Amorite of Heshbon, and his land. Begin to take possession by engaging him in battle."
Deuteronomy,2,25,"This day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you upon the peoples everywhere under heaven; when they hear report of you, they will tremble and be in anguish because of you.”"
Deuteronomy,2,26,So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to King Sihon of Heshbon with the following terms of peace:
Deuteronomy,2,27,"“If you let me pass through your land, I will travel only along the road; I will turn aside neither to the right nor to the left."
Deuteronomy,2,28,"You shall sell me food for money, so that I may eat, and supply me water for money, so that I may drink. Only allow me to pass through on foot—"
Deuteronomy,2,29,just as the descendants of Esau who live in Seir have done for me and likewise the Moabites who live in Ar—until I cross the Jordan into the land that the Lord our God is giving us.”
Deuteronomy,2,30,"But King Sihon of Heshbon was not willing to let us pass through, for the Lord your God had hardened his spirit and made his heart defiant in order to hand him over to you, as he has now done."
Deuteronomy,2,31,"The Lord said to me, “See, I have begun to give Sihon and his land over to you. Begin now to take possession of his land.”"
Deuteronomy,2,32,"So when Sihon came out against us, he and all his people for battle at Jahaz,"
Deuteronomy,2,33,"the Lord our God gave him over to us; and we struck him down, along with his offspring and all his people."
Deuteronomy,2,34,"At that time we captured all his towns, and in each town we utterly destroyed men, women, and children. We left not a single survivor."
Deuteronomy,2,35,"Only the livestock we kept as spoil for ourselves, as well as the plunder of the towns that we had captured."
Deuteronomy,2,36,"From Aroer on the edge of the Wadi Arnon (including the town that is in the wadi itself) as far as Gilead, there was no citadel too high for us. The Lord our God gave everything to us."
Deuteronomy,2,37,"You did not encroach, however, on the land of the Ammonites, avoiding the whole upper region of the Wadi Jabbok as well as the towns of the hill country, just as the Lord our God had charged."
Deuteronomy,3,1,"When we headed up the road to Bashan, King Og of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, for battle at Edrei."
Deuteronomy,3,2,"The Lord said to me, “Do not fear him, for I have handed him over to you, along with his people and his land. Do to him as you did to King Sihon of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon.”"
Deuteronomy,3,3,So the Lord our God also handed over to us King Og of Bashan and all his people. We struck him down until not a single survivor was left.
Deuteronomy,3,4,"At that time we captured all his towns; there was no citadel that we did not take from them—sixty towns, the whole region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan."
Deuteronomy,3,5,"All these were fortress towns with high walls, double gates, and bars, besides a great many villages."
Deuteronomy,3,6,"And we utterly destroyed them, as we had done to King Sihon of Heshbon, in each city utterly destroying men, women, and children."
Deuteronomy,3,7,But all the livestock and the plunder of the towns we kept as spoil for ourselves.
Deuteronomy,3,8,"So at that time we took from the two kings of the Amorites the land beyond the Jordan, from the Wadi Arnon to Mount Hermon"
Deuteronomy,3,9,"(the Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, while the Amorites call it Senir),"
Deuteronomy,3,10,"all the towns of the tableland, the whole of Gilead, and all of Bashan, as far as Salecah and Edrei, towns of Og's kingdom in Bashan."
Deuteronomy,3,11,"(Now only King Og of Bashan was left of the remnant of the Rephaim. In fact his bed, an iron bed, can still be seen in Rabbah of the Ammonites. By the common cubit it is nine cubits long and four cubits wide.)"
Deuteronomy,3,12,"As for the land that we took possession of at that time, I gave to the Reubenites and Gadites the territory north of Aroer, that is on the edge of the Wadi Arnon, as well as half the hill country of Gilead with its towns,"
Deuteronomy,3,13,"and I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh the rest of Gilead and all of Bashan, Og's kingdom. (The whole region of Argob: all that portion of Bashan used to be called a land of Rephaim;"
Deuteronomy,3,14,"Jair the Manassite acquired the whole region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and he named them—that is, Bashan—after himself, Havvoth-jair, as it is to this day.)"
Deuteronomy,3,15,To Machir I gave Gilead.
Deuteronomy,3,16,"And to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave the territory from Gilead as far as the Wadi Arnon, with the middle of the wadi as a boundary, and up to the Jabbok, the wadi being boundary of the Ammonites;"
Deuteronomy,3,17,"the Arabah also, with the Jordan and its banks, from Chinnereth down to the sea of the Arabah, the Dead Sea, with the lower slopes of Pisgah on the east."
Deuteronomy,3,18,"At that time, I charged you as follows: “Although the Lord your God has given you this land to occupy, all your troops shall cross over armed as the vanguard of your Israelite kin."
Deuteronomy,3,19,"Only your wives, your children, and your livestock—I know that you have much livestock—shall stay behind in the towns that I have given to you."
Deuteronomy,3,20,"When the Lord gives rest to your kindred, as to you, and they too have occupied the land that the Lord your God is giving them beyond the Jordan, then each of you may return to the property that I have given to you.”"
Deuteronomy,3,21,"And I charged Joshua as well at that time, saying: “Your own eyes have seen everything that the Lord your God has done to these two kings; so the Lord will do to all the kingdoms into which you are about to cross."
Deuteronomy,3,22,"Do not fear them, for it is the Lord your God who fights for you.”"
Deuteronomy,3,23,"At that time, too, I entreated the Lord , saying:"
Deuteronomy,3,24,"“O Lord God , you have only begun to show your servant your greatness and your might; what god in heaven or on earth can perform deeds and mighty acts like yours!"
Deuteronomy,3,25,"Let me cross over to see the good land beyond the Jordan, that good hill country and the Lebanon.”"
Deuteronomy,3,26,"But the Lord was angry with me on your account and would not heed me. The Lord said to me, “Enough from you! Never speak to me of this matter again!"
Deuteronomy,3,27,"Go up to the top of Pisgah and look around you to the west, to the north, to the south, and to the east. Look well, for you shall not cross over this Jordan."
Deuteronomy,3,28,"But charge Joshua, and encourage and strengthen him, because it is he who shall cross over at the head of this people and who shall secure their possession of the land that you will see.”"
Deuteronomy,3,29,So we remained in the valley opposite Beth-peor.
Deuteronomy,4,1,"So now, Israel, give heed to the statutes and ordinances that I am teaching you to observe, so that you may live to enter and occupy the land that the Lord , the God of your ancestors, is giving you."
Deuteronomy,4,2,"You must neither add anything to what I command you nor take away anything from it, but keep the commandments of the Lord your God with which I am charging you."
Deuteronomy,4,3,"You have seen for yourselves what the Lord did with regard to the Baal of Peor—how the Lord your God destroyed from among you everyone who followed the Baal of Peor,"
Deuteronomy,4,4,while those of you who held fast to the Lord your God are all alive today.
Deuteronomy,4,5,"See, just as the Lord my God has charged me, I now teach you statutes and ordinances for you to observe in the land that you are about to enter and occupy."
Deuteronomy,4,6,"You must observe them diligently, for this will show your wisdom and discernment to the peoples, who, when they hear all these statutes, will say, “Surely this great nation is a wise and discerning people!”"
Deuteronomy,4,7,For what other great nation has a god so near to it as the Lord our God is whenever we call to him?
Deuteronomy,4,8,And what other great nation has statutes and ordinances as just as this entire law that I am setting before you today?
Deuteronomy,4,9,"But take care and watch yourselves closely, so as neither to forget the things that your eyes have seen nor to let them slip from your mind all the days of your life; make them known to your children and your children's children—"
Deuteronomy,4,10,"how you once stood before the Lord your God at Horeb, when the Lord said to me, “Assemble the people for me, and I will let them hear my words, so that they may learn to fear me as long as they live on the earth, and may teach their children so”;"
Deuteronomy,4,11,"you approached and stood at the foot of the mountain while the mountain was blazing up to the very heavens, shrouded in dark clouds."
Deuteronomy,4,12,Then the Lord spoke to you out of the fire. You heard the sound of words but saw no form; there was only a voice.
Deuteronomy,4,13,"He declared to you his covenant, which he charged you to observe, that is, the ten commandments; and he wrote them on two stone tablets."
Deuteronomy,4,14,And the Lord charged me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances for you to observe in the land that you are about to cross into and occupy.
Deuteronomy,4,15,"Since you saw no form when the Lord spoke to you at Horeb out of the fire, take care and watch yourselves closely,"
Deuteronomy,4,16,"so that you do not act corruptly by making an idol for yourselves, in the form of any figure—the likeness of male or female,"
Deuteronomy,4,17,"the likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the air,"
Deuteronomy,4,18,"the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth."
Deuteronomy,4,19,"And when you look up to the heavens and see the sun, the moon, and the stars, all the host of heaven, do not be led astray and bow down to them and serve them, things that the Lord your God has allotted to all the peoples everywhere under heaven."
Deuteronomy,4,20,"But the Lord has taken you and brought you out of the iron-smelter, out of Egypt, to become a people of his very own possession, as you are now."
Deuteronomy,4,21,"The Lord was angry with me because of you, and he vowed that I should not cross the Jordan and that I should not enter the good land that the Lord your God is giving for your possession."
Deuteronomy,4,22,"For I am going to die in this land without crossing over the Jordan, but you are going to cross over to take possession of that good land."
Deuteronomy,4,23,"So be careful not to forget the covenant that the Lord your God made with you, and not to make for yourselves an idol in the form of anything that the Lord your God has forbidden you."
Deuteronomy,4,24,"For the Lord your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God."
Deuteronomy,4,25,"When you have had children and children's children, and become complacent in the land, if you act corruptly by making an idol in the form of anything, thus doing what is evil in the sight of the Lord your God, and provoking him to anger,"
Deuteronomy,4,26,"I call heaven and earth to witness against you today that you will soon utterly perish from the land that you are crossing the Jordan to occupy; you will not live long on it, but will be utterly destroyed."
Deuteronomy,4,27,The Lord will scatter you among the peoples; only a few of you will be left among the nations where the Lord will lead you.
Deuteronomy,4,28,"There you will serve other gods made by human hands, objects of wood and stone that neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell."
Deuteronomy,4,29,"From there you will seek the Lord your God, and you will find him if you search after him with all your heart and soul."
Deuteronomy,4,30,"In your distress, when all these things have happened to you in time to come, you will return to the Lord your God and heed him."
Deuteronomy,4,31,"Because the Lord your God is a merciful God, he will neither abandon you nor destroy you; he will not forget the covenant with your ancestors that he swore to them."
Deuteronomy,4,32,"For ask now about former ages, long before your own, ever since the day that God created human beings on the earth; ask from one end of heaven to the other: has anything so great as this ever happened or has its like ever been heard of?"
Deuteronomy,4,33,"Has any people ever heard the voice of a god speaking out of a fire, as you have heard, and lived?"
Deuteronomy,4,34,"Or has any god ever attempted to go and take a nation for himself from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs and wonders, by war, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and by terrifying displays of power, as the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before your very eyes?"
Deuteronomy,4,35,To you it was shown so that you would acknowledge that the Lord is God; there is no other besides him.
Deuteronomy,4,36,"From heaven he made you hear his voice to discipline you. On earth he showed you his great fire, while you heard his words coming out of the fire."
Deuteronomy,4,37,"And because he loved your ancestors, he chose their descendants after them. He brought you out of Egypt with his own presence, by his great power,"
Deuteronomy,4,38,"driving out before you nations greater and mightier than yourselves, to bring you in, giving you their land for a possession, as it is still today."
Deuteronomy,4,39,So acknowledge today and take to heart that the Lord is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath; there is no other.
Deuteronomy,4,40,"Keep his statutes and his commandments, which I am commanding you today for your own well-being and that of your descendants after you, so that you may long remain in the land that the Lord your God is giving you for all time."
Deuteronomy,4,41,Then Moses set apart on the east side of the Jordan three cities
Deuteronomy,4,42,"to which a homicide could flee, someone who unintentionally kills another person, the two not having been at enmity before; the homicide could flee to one of these cities and live:"
Deuteronomy,4,43,"Bezer in the wilderness on the tableland belonging to the Reubenites, Ramoth in Gilead belonging to the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan belonging to the Manassites."
Deuteronomy,4,44,This is the law that Moses set before the Israelites.
Deuteronomy,4,45,"These are the decrees and the statutes and ordinances that Moses spoke to the Israelites when they had come out of Egypt,"
Deuteronomy,4,46,"beyond the Jordan in the valley opposite Beth-peor, in the land of King Sihon of the Amorites, who reigned at Heshbon, whom Moses and the Israelites defeated when they came out of Egypt."
Deuteronomy,4,47,"They occupied his land and the land of King Og of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites on the eastern side of the Jordan:"
Deuteronomy,4,48,"from Aroer, which is on the edge of the Wadi Arnon, as far as Mount Sirion (that is, Hermon),"
Deuteronomy,4,49,"together with all the Arabah on the east side of the Jordan as far as the Sea of the Arabah, under the slopes of Pisgah."
Deuteronomy,5,1,"Moses convened all Israel, and said to them: Hear, O Israel, the statutes and ordinances that I am addressing to you today; you shall learn them and observe them diligently."
Deuteronomy,5,2,The Lord our God made a covenant with us at Horeb.
Deuteronomy,5,3,"Not with our ancestors did the Lord make this covenant, but with us, who are all of us here alive today."
Deuteronomy,5,4,"The Lord spoke with you face to face at the mountain, out of the fire."
Deuteronomy,5,5,(At that time I was standing between the Lord and you to declare to you the words of the Lord ; for you were afraid because of the fire and did not go up the mountain.) And he said:
Deuteronomy,5,6,"I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery;"
Deuteronomy,5,7,you shall have no other gods before me.
Deuteronomy,5,8,"You shall not make for yourself an idol, whether in the form of anything that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth."
Deuteronomy,5,9,"You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, punishing children for the iniquity of parents, to the third and fourth generation of those who reject me,"
Deuteronomy,5,10,but showing steadfast love to the thousandth generation of those who love me and keep my commandments.
Deuteronomy,5,11,"You shall not make wrongful use of the name of the Lord your God, for the Lord will not acquit anyone who misuses his name."
Deuteronomy,5,12,"Observe the sabbath day and keep it holy, as the Lord your God commanded you."
Deuteronomy,5,13,Six days you shall labor and do all your work.
Deuteronomy,5,14,"But the seventh day is a sabbath to the Lord your God; you shall not do any work—you, or your son or your daughter, or your male or female slave, or your ox or your donkey, or any of your livestock, or the resident alien in your towns, so that your male and female slave may rest as well as you."
Deuteronomy,5,15,"Remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the Lord your God brought you out from there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm; therefore the Lord your God commanded you to keep the sabbath day."
Deuteronomy,5,16,"Honor your father and your mother, as the Lord your God commanded you, so that your days may be long and that it may go well with you in the land that the Lord your God is giving you."
Deuteronomy,5,17,You shall not murder.
Deuteronomy,5,18,Neither shall you commit adultery.
Deuteronomy,5,19,Neither shall you steal.
Deuteronomy,5,20,Neither shall you bear false witness against your neighbor.
Deuteronomy,5,21,"Neither shall you covet your neighbor's wife. Neither shall you desire your neighbor's house, or field, or male or female slave, or ox, or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor."
Deuteronomy,5,22,"These words the Lord spoke with a loud voice to your whole assembly at the mountain, out of the fire, the cloud, and the thick darkness, and he added no more. He wrote them on two stone tablets, and gave them to me."
Deuteronomy,5,23,"When you heard the voice out of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire, you approached me, all the heads of your tribes and your elders;"
Deuteronomy,5,24,"and you said, “Look, the Lord our God has shown us his glory and greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the fire. Today we have seen that God may speak to someone and the person may still live."
Deuteronomy,5,25,"So now why should we die? For this great fire will consume us; if we hear the voice of the Lord our God any longer, we shall die."
Deuteronomy,5,26,"For who is there of all flesh that has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of fire, as we have, and remained alive?"
Deuteronomy,5,27,"Go near, you yourself, and hear all that the Lord our God will say. Then tell us everything that the Lord our God tells you, and we will listen and do it.”"
Deuteronomy,5,28,"The Lord heard your words when you spoke to me, and the Lord said to me: “I have heard the words of this people, which they have spoken to you; they are right in all that they have spoken."
Deuteronomy,5,29,"If only they had such a mind as this, to fear me and to keep all my commandments always, so that it might go well with them and with their children forever!"
Deuteronomy,5,30,"Go say to them, ‘Return to your tents.’"
Deuteronomy,5,31,"But you, stand here by me, and I will tell you all the commandments, the statutes and the ordinances, that you shall teach them, so that they may do them in the land that I am giving them to possess.”"
Deuteronomy,5,32,You must therefore be careful to do as the Lord your God has commanded you; you shall not turn to the right or to the left.
Deuteronomy,5,33,"You must follow exactly the path that the Lord your God has commanded you, so that you may live, and that it may go well with you, and that you may live long in the land that you are to possess."
Deuteronomy,6,1,"Now this is the commandment—the statutes and the ordinances—that the Lord your God charged me to teach you to observe in the land that you are about to cross into and occupy,"
Deuteronomy,6,2,"so that you and your children and your children's children may fear the Lord your God all the days of your life, and keep all his decrees and his commandments that I am commanding you, so that your days may be long."
Deuteronomy,6,3,"Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe them diligently, so that it may go well with you, and so that you may multiply greatly in a land flowing with milk and honey, as the Lord , the God of your ancestors, has promised you."
Deuteronomy,6,4,"Hear, O Israel: The Lord is our God, the Lord alone."
Deuteronomy,6,5,"You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might."
Deuteronomy,6,6,Keep these words that I am commanding you today in your heart.
Deuteronomy,6,7,"Recite them to your children and talk about them when you are at home and when you are away, when you lie down and when you rise."
Deuteronomy,6,8,"Bind them as a sign on your hand, fix them as an emblem on your forehead,"
Deuteronomy,6,9,and write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.
Deuteronomy,6,10,"When the Lord your God has brought you into the land that he swore to your ancestors, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give you—a land with fine, large cities that you did not build,"
Deuteronomy,6,11,"houses filled with all sorts of goods that you did not fill, hewn cisterns that you did not hew, vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant—and when you have eaten your fill,"
Deuteronomy,6,12,"take care that you do not forget the Lord , who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery."
Deuteronomy,6,13,"The Lord your God you shall fear; him you shall serve, and by his name alone you shall swear."
Deuteronomy,6,14,"Do not follow other gods, any of the gods of the peoples who are all around you,"
Deuteronomy,6,15,"because the Lord your God, who is present with you, is a jealous God. The anger of the Lord your God would be kindled against you and he would destroy you from the face of the earth."
Deuteronomy,6,16,"Do not put the Lord your God to the test, as you tested him at Massah."
Deuteronomy,6,17,"You must diligently keep the commandments of the Lord your God, and his decrees, and his statutes that he has commanded you."
Deuteronomy,6,18,"Do what is right and good in the sight of the Lord , so that it may go well with you, and so that you may go in and occupy the good land that the Lord swore to your ancestors to give you,"
Deuteronomy,6,19,"thrusting out all your enemies from before you, as the Lord has promised."
Deuteronomy,6,20,"When your children ask you in time to come, “What is the meaning of the decrees and the statutes and the ordinances that the Lord our God has commanded you?”"
Deuteronomy,6,21,"then you shall say to your children, “We were Pharaoh's slaves in Egypt, but the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand."
Deuteronomy,6,22,"The Lord displayed before our eyes great and awesome signs and wonders against Egypt, against Pharaoh and all his household."
Deuteronomy,6,23,"He brought us out from there in order to bring us in, to give us the land that he promised on oath to our ancestors."
Deuteronomy,6,24,"Then the Lord commanded us to observe all these statutes, to fear the Lord our God, for our lasting good, so as to keep us alive, as is now the case."
Deuteronomy,6,25,"If we diligently observe this entire commandment before the Lord our God, as he has commanded us, we will be in the right.”"
Deuteronomy,7,1,"When the Lord your God brings you into the land that you are about to enter and occupy, and he clears away many nations before you—the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations mightier and more numerous than you—"
Deuteronomy,7,2,"and when the Lord your God gives them over to you and you defeat them, then you must utterly destroy them. Make no covenant with them and show them no mercy."
Deuteronomy,7,3,"Do not intermarry with them, giving your daughters to their sons or taking their daughters for your sons,"
Deuteronomy,7,4,"for that would turn away your children from following me, to serve other gods. Then the anger of the Lord would be kindled against you, and he would destroy you quickly."
Deuteronomy,7,5,"But this is how you must deal with them: break down their altars, smash their pillars, hew down their sacred poles, and burn their idols with fire."
Deuteronomy,7,6,"For you are a people holy to the Lord your God; the Lord your God has chosen you out of all the peoples on earth to be his people, his treasured possession."
Deuteronomy,7,7,It was not because you were more numerous than any other people that the Lord set his heart on you and chose you—for you were the fewest of all peoples.
Deuteronomy,7,8,"It was because the Lord loved you and kept the oath that he swore to your ancestors, that the Lord has brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you from the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt."
Deuteronomy,7,9,"Know therefore that the Lord your God is God, the faithful God who maintains covenant loyalty with those who love him and keep his commandments, to a thousand generations,"
Deuteronomy,7,10,and who repays in their own person those who reject him. He does not delay but repays in their own person those who reject him.
Deuteronomy,7,11,"Therefore, observe diligently the commandment—the statutes, and the ordinances—that I am commanding you today."
Deuteronomy,7,12,"If you heed these ordinances, by diligently observing them, the Lord your God will maintain with you the covenant loyalty that he swore to your ancestors;"
Deuteronomy,7,13,"he will love you, bless you, and multiply you; he will bless the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your ground, your grain and your wine and your oil, the increase of your cattle and the issue of your flock, in the land that he swore to your ancestors to give you."
Deuteronomy,7,14,"You shall be the most blessed of peoples, with neither sterility nor barrenness among you or your livestock."
Deuteronomy,7,15,"The Lord will turn away from you every illness; all the dread diseases of Egypt that you experienced, he will not inflict on you, but he will lay them on all who hate you."
Deuteronomy,7,16,"You shall devour all the peoples that the Lord your God is giving over to you, showing them no pity; you shall not serve their gods, for that would be a snare to you."
Deuteronomy,7,17,"If you say to yourself, “These nations are more numerous than I; how can I dispossess them?”"
Deuteronomy,7,18,"do not be afraid of them. Just remember what the Lord your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt,"
Deuteronomy,7,19,"the great trials that your eyes saw, the signs and wonders, the mighty hand and the outstretched arm by which the Lord your God brought you out. The Lord your God will do the same to all the peoples of whom you are afraid."
Deuteronomy,7,20,"Moreover, the Lord your God will send the pestilence against them, until even the survivors and the fugitives are destroyed."
Deuteronomy,7,21,"Have no dread of them, for the Lord your God, who is present with you, is a great and awesome God."
Deuteronomy,7,22,"The Lord your God will clear away these nations before you little by little; you will not be able to make a quick end of them, otherwise the wild animals would become too numerous for you."
Deuteronomy,7,23,"But the Lord your God will give them over to you, and throw them into great panic, until they are destroyed."
Deuteronomy,7,24,"He will hand their kings over to you and you shall blot out their name from under heaven; no one will be able to stand against you, until you have destroyed them."
Deuteronomy,7,25,"The images of their gods you shall burn with fire. Do not covet the silver or the gold that is on them and take it for yourself, because you could be ensnared by it; for it is abhorrent to the Lord your God."
Deuteronomy,7,26,"Do not bring an abhorrent thing into your house, or you will be set apart for destruction like it. You must utterly detest and abhor it, for it is set apart for destruction."
Deuteronomy,8,1,"This entire commandment that I command you today you must diligently observe, so that you may live and increase, and go in and occupy the land that the Lord promised on oath to your ancestors."
Deuteronomy,8,2,"Remember the long way that the Lord your God has led you these forty years in the wilderness, in order to humble you, testing you to know what was in your heart, whether or not you would keep his commandments."
Deuteronomy,8,3,"He humbled you by letting you hunger, then by feeding you with manna, with which neither you nor your ancestors were acquainted, in order to make you understand that one does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord."
Deuteronomy,8,4,The clothes on your back did not wear out and your feet did not swell these forty years.
Deuteronomy,8,5,Know then in your heart that as a parent disciplines a child so the Lord your God disciplines you.
Deuteronomy,8,6,"Therefore keep the commandments of the Lord your God, by walking in his ways and by fearing him."
Deuteronomy,8,7,"For the Lord your God is bringing you into a good land, a land with flowing streams, with springs and underground waters welling up in valleys and hills,"
Deuteronomy,8,8,"a land of wheat and barley, of vines and fig trees and pomegranates, a land of olive trees and honey,"
Deuteronomy,8,9,"a land where you may eat bread without scarcity, where you will lack nothing, a land whose stones are iron and from whose hills you may mine copper."
Deuteronomy,8,10,You shall eat your fill and bless the Lord your God for the good land that he has given you.
Deuteronomy,8,11,"Take care that you do not forget the Lord your God, by failing to keep his commandments, his ordinances, and his statutes, which I am commanding you today."
Deuteronomy,8,12,"When you have eaten your fill and have built fine houses and live in them,"
Deuteronomy,8,13,"and when your herds and flocks have multiplied, and your silver and gold is multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied,"
Deuteronomy,8,14,"then do not exalt yourself, forgetting the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery,"
Deuteronomy,8,15,"who led you through the great and terrible wilderness, an arid wasteland with poisonous snakes and scorpions. He made water flow for you from flint rock,"
Deuteronomy,8,16,"and fed you in the wilderness with manna that your ancestors did not know, to humble you and to test you, and in the end to do you good."
Deuteronomy,8,17,"Do not say to yourself, “My power and the might of my own hand have gotten me this wealth.”"
Deuteronomy,8,18,"But remember the Lord your God, for it is he who gives you power to get wealth, so that he may confirm his covenant that he swore to your ancestors, as he is doing today."
Deuteronomy,8,19,"If you do forget the Lord your God and follow other gods to serve and worship them, I solemnly warn you today that you shall surely perish."
Deuteronomy,8,20,"Like the nations that the Lord is destroying before you, so shall you perish, because you would not obey the voice of the Lord your God."
Deuteronomy,9,1,"Hear, O Israel! You are about to cross the Jordan today, to go in and dispossess nations larger and mightier than you, great cities, fortified to the heavens,"
Deuteronomy,9,2,"a strong and tall people, the offspring of the Anakim, whom you know. You have heard it said of them, “Who can stand up to the Anakim?”"
Deuteronomy,9,3,"Know then today that the Lord your God is the one who crosses over before you as a devouring fire; he will defeat them and subdue them before you, so that you may dispossess and destroy them quickly, as the Lord has promised you."
Deuteronomy,9,4,"When the Lord your God thrusts them out before you, do not say to yourself, “It is because of my righteousness that the Lord has brought me in to occupy this land”; it is rather because of the wickedness of these nations that the Lord is dispossessing them before you."
Deuteronomy,9,5,"It is not because of your righteousness or the uprightness of your heart that you are going in to occupy their land; but because of the wickedness of these nations the Lord your God is dispossessing them before you, in order to fulfill the promise that the Lord made on oath to your ancestors, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob."
Deuteronomy,9,6,"Know, then, that the Lord your God is not giving you this good land to occupy because of your righteousness; for you are a stubborn people."
Deuteronomy,9,7,Remember and do not forget how you provoked the Lord your God to wrath in the wilderness; you have been rebellious against the Lord from the day you came out of the land of Egypt until you came to this place.
Deuteronomy,9,8,"Even at Horeb you provoked the Lord to wrath, and the Lord was so angry with you that he was ready to destroy you."
Deuteronomy,9,9,"When I went up the mountain to receive the stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant that the Lord made with you, I remained on the mountain forty days and forty nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water."
Deuteronomy,9,10,And the Lord gave me the two stone tablets written with the finger of God; on them were all the words that the Lord had spoken to you at the mountain out of the fire on the day of the assembly.
Deuteronomy,9,11,"At the end of forty days and forty nights the Lord gave me the two stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant."
Deuteronomy,9,12,"Then the Lord said to me, “Get up, go down quickly from here, for your people whom you have brought from Egypt have acted corruptly. They have been quick to turn from the way that I commanded them; they have cast an image for themselves.”"
Deuteronomy,9,13,"Furthermore the Lord said to me, “I have seen that this people is indeed a stubborn people."
Deuteronomy,9,14,Let me alone that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven; and I will make of you a nation mightier and more numerous than they.”
Deuteronomy,9,15,"So I turned and went down from the mountain, while the mountain was ablaze; the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands."
Deuteronomy,9,16,"Then I saw that you had indeed sinned against the Lord your God, by casting for yourselves an image of a calf; you had been quick to turn from the way that the Lord had commanded you."
Deuteronomy,9,17,"So I took hold of the two tablets and flung them from my two hands, smashing them before your eyes."
Deuteronomy,9,18,"Then I lay prostrate before the Lord as before, forty days and forty nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all the sin you had committed, provoking the Lord by doing what was evil in his sight."
Deuteronomy,9,19,For I was afraid that the anger that the Lord bore against you was so fierce that he would destroy you. But the Lord listened to me that time also.
Deuteronomy,9,20,"The Lord was so angry with Aaron that he was ready to destroy him, but I interceded also on behalf of Aaron at that same time."
Deuteronomy,9,21,"Then I took the sinful thing you had made, the calf, and burned it with fire and crushed it, grinding it thoroughly, until it was reduced to dust; and I threw the dust of it into the stream that runs down the mountain."
Deuteronomy,9,22,"At Taberah also, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, you provoked the Lord to wrath."
Deuteronomy,9,23,"And when the Lord sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, “Go up and occupy the land that I have given you,” you rebelled against the command of the Lord your God, neither trusting him nor obeying him."
Deuteronomy,9,24,You have been rebellious against the Lord as long as he has known you.
Deuteronomy,9,25,"Throughout the forty days and forty nights that I lay prostrate before the Lord when the Lord intended to destroy you,"
Deuteronomy,9,26,"I prayed to the Lord and said, “Lord God , do not destroy the people who are your very own possession, whom you redeemed in your greatness, whom you brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand."
Deuteronomy,9,27,"Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; pay no attention to the stubbornness of this people, their wickedness and their sin,"
Deuteronomy,9,28,"otherwise the land from which you have brought us might say, ‘Because the Lord was not able to bring them into the land that he promised them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to let them die in the wilderness.’"
Deuteronomy,9,29,"For they are the people of your very own possession, whom you brought out by your great power and by your outstretched arm.”"
Deuteronomy,10,1,"At that time the Lord said to me, “Carve out two tablets of stone like the former ones, and come up to me on the mountain, and make an ark of wood."
Deuteronomy,10,2,"I will write on the tablets the words that were on the former tablets, which you smashed, and you shall put them in the ark.”"
Deuteronomy,10,3,"So I made an ark of acacia wood, cut two tablets of stone like the former ones, and went up the mountain with the two tablets in my hand."
Deuteronomy,10,4,"Then he wrote on the tablets the same words as before, the ten commandments that the Lord had spoken to you on the mountain out of the fire on the day of the assembly; and the Lord gave them to me."
Deuteronomy,10,5,"So I turned and came down from the mountain, and put the tablets in the ark that I had made; and there they are, as the Lord commanded me."
Deuteronomy,10,6,"(The Israelites journeyed from Beeroth-bene-jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died, and there he was buried; his son Eleazar succeeded him as priest."
Deuteronomy,10,7,"From there they journeyed to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land with flowing streams."
Deuteronomy,10,8,"At that time the Lord set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the Lord , to stand before the Lord to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day."
Deuteronomy,10,9,"Therefore Levi has no allotment or inheritance with his kindred; the Lord is his inheritance, as the Lord your God promised him.)"
Deuteronomy,10,10,"I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights, as I had done the first time. And once again the Lord listened to me. The Lord was unwilling to destroy you."
Deuteronomy,10,11,"The Lord said to me, “Get up, go on your journey at the head of the people, that they may go in and occupy the land that I swore to their ancestors to give them.”"
Deuteronomy,10,12,"So now, O Israel, what does the Lord your God require of you? Only to fear the Lord your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, to serve the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul,"
Deuteronomy,10,13,"and to keep the commandments of the Lord your God and his decrees that I am commanding you today, for your own well-being."
Deuteronomy,10,14,"Although heaven and the heaven of heavens belong to the Lord your God, the earth with all that is in it,"
Deuteronomy,10,15,"yet the Lord set his heart in love on your ancestors alone and chose you, their descendants after them, out of all the peoples, as it is today."
Deuteronomy,10,16,"Circumcise, then, the foreskin of your heart, and do not be stubborn any longer."
Deuteronomy,10,17,"For the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God, mighty and awesome, who is not partial and takes no bribe,"
Deuteronomy,10,18,"who executes justice for the orphan and the widow, and who loves the strangers, providing them food and clothing."
Deuteronomy,10,19,"You shall also love the stranger, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt."
Deuteronomy,10,20,"You shall fear the Lord your God; him alone you shall worship; to him you shall hold fast, and by his name you shall swear."
Deuteronomy,10,21,"He is your praise; he is your God, who has done for you these great and awesome things that your own eyes have seen."
Deuteronomy,10,22,Your ancestors went down to Egypt seventy persons; and now the Lord your God has made you as numerous as the stars in heaven.
Deuteronomy,11,1,"You shall love the Lord your God, therefore, and keep his charge, his decrees, his ordinances, and his commandments always."
Deuteronomy,11,2,"Remember today that it was not your children (who have not known or seen the discipline of the Lord your God), but it is you who must acknowledge his greatness, his mighty hand and his outstretched arm,"
Deuteronomy,11,3,"his signs and his deeds that he did in Egypt to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and to all his land;"
Deuteronomy,11,4,"what he did to the Egyptian army, to their horses and chariots, how he made the water of the Red Sea flow over them as they pursued you, so that the Lord has destroyed them to this day;"
Deuteronomy,11,5,"what he did to you in the wilderness, until you came to this place;"
Deuteronomy,11,6,"and what he did to Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab son of Reuben, how in the midst of all Israel the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, along with their households, their tents, and every living being in their company;"
Deuteronomy,11,7,for it is your own eyes that have seen every great deed that the Lord did.
Deuteronomy,11,8,"Keep, then, this entire commandment that I am commanding you today, so that you may have strength to go in and occupy the land that you are crossing over to occupy,"
Deuteronomy,11,9,"and so that you may live long in the land that the Lord swore to your ancestors to give them and to their descendants, a land flowing with milk and honey."
Deuteronomy,11,10,"For the land that you are about to enter to occupy is not like the land of Egypt, from which you have come, where you sow your seed and irrigate by foot like a vegetable garden."
Deuteronomy,11,11,"But the land that you are crossing over to occupy is a land of hills and valleys, watered by rain from the sky,"
Deuteronomy,11,12,"a land that the Lord your God looks after. The eyes of the Lord your God are always on it, from the beginning of the year to the end of the year."
Deuteronomy,11,13,"If you will only heed his every commandment that I am commanding you today—loving the Lord your God, and serving him with all your heart and with all your soul—"
Deuteronomy,11,14,"then he will give the rain for your land in its season, the early rain and the later rain, and you will gather in your grain, your wine, and your oil;"
Deuteronomy,11,15,"and he will give grass in your fields for your livestock, and you will eat your fill."
Deuteronomy,11,16,"Take care, or you will be seduced into turning away, serving other gods and worshiping them,"
Deuteronomy,11,17,"for then the anger of the Lord will be kindled against you and he will shut up the heavens, so that there will be no rain and the land will yield no fruit; then you will perish quickly off the good land that the Lord is giving you."
Deuteronomy,11,18,"You shall put these words of mine in your heart and soul, and you shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and fix them as an emblem on your forehead."
Deuteronomy,11,19,"Teach them to your children, talking about them when you are at home and when you are away, when you lie down and when you rise."
Deuteronomy,11,20,"Write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates,"
Deuteronomy,11,21,"so that your days and the days of your children may be multiplied in the land that the Lord swore to your ancestors to give them, as long as the heavens are above the earth."
Deuteronomy,11,22,"If you will diligently observe this entire commandment that I am commanding you, loving the Lord your God, walking in all his ways, and holding fast to him,"
Deuteronomy,11,23,"then the Lord will drive out all these nations before you, and you will dispossess nations larger and mightier than yourselves."
Deuteronomy,11,24,"Every place on which you set foot shall be yours; your territory shall extend from the wilderness to the Lebanon and from the River, the river Euphrates, to the Western Sea."
Deuteronomy,11,25,"No one will be able to stand against you; the Lord your God will put the fear and dread of you on all the land on which you set foot, as he promised you."
Deuteronomy,11,26,"See, I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse:"
Deuteronomy,11,27,"the blessing, if you obey the commandments of the Lord your God that I am commanding you today;"
Deuteronomy,11,28,"and the curse, if you do not obey the commandments of the Lord your God, but turn from the way that I am commanding you today, to follow other gods that you have not known."
Deuteronomy,11,29,"When the Lord your God has brought you into the land that you are entering to occupy, you shall set the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal."
Deuteronomy,11,30,"As you know, they are beyond the Jordan, some distance to the west, in the land of the Canaanites who live in the Arabah, opposite Gilgal, beside the oak of Moreh."
Deuteronomy,11,31,"When you cross the Jordan to go in to occupy the land that the Lord your God is giving you, and when you occupy it and live in it,"
Deuteronomy,11,32,you must diligently observe all the statutes and ordinances that I am setting before you today.
Deuteronomy,12,1,"These are the statutes and ordinances that you must diligently observe in the land that the Lord , the God of your ancestors, has given you to occupy all the days that you live on the earth."
Deuteronomy,12,2,"You must demolish completely all the places where the nations whom you are about to dispossess served their gods, on the mountain heights, on the hills, and under every leafy tree."
Deuteronomy,12,3,"Break down their altars, smash their pillars, burn their sacred poles with fire, and hew down the idols of their gods, and thus blot out their name from their places."
Deuteronomy,12,4,You shall not worship the Lord your God in such ways.
Deuteronomy,12,5,"But you shall seek the place that the Lord your God will choose out of all your tribes as his habitation to put his name there. You shall go there,"
Deuteronomy,12,6,"bringing there your burnt offerings and your sacrifices, your tithes and your donations, your votive gifts, your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and flocks."
Deuteronomy,12,7,"And you shall eat there in the presence of the Lord your God, you and your households together, rejoicing in all the undertakings in which the Lord your God has blessed you."
Deuteronomy,12,8,"You shall not act as we are acting here today, all of us according to our own desires,"
Deuteronomy,12,9,for you have not yet come into the rest and the possession that the Lord your God is giving you.
Deuteronomy,12,10,"When you cross over the Jordan and live in the land that the Lord your God is allotting to you, and when he gives you rest from your enemies all around so that you live in safety,"
Deuteronomy,12,11,"then you shall bring everything that I command you to the place that the Lord your God will choose as a dwelling for his name: your burnt offerings and your sacrifices, your tithes and your donations, and all your choice votive gifts that you vow to the Lord."
Deuteronomy,12,12,"And you shall rejoice before the Lord your God, you together with your sons and your daughters, your male and female slaves, and the Levites who reside in your towns (since they have no allotment or inheritance with you)."
Deuteronomy,12,13,Take care that you do not offer your burnt offerings at any place you happen to see.
Deuteronomy,12,14,But only at the place that the Lord will choose in one of your tribes—there you shall offer your burnt offerings and there you shall do everything I command you.
Deuteronomy,12,15,"Yet whenever you desire you may slaughter and eat meat within any of your towns, according to the blessing that the Lord your God has given you; the unclean and the clean may eat of it, as they would of gazelle or deer."
Deuteronomy,12,16,"The blood, however, you must not eat; you shall pour it out on the ground like water."
Deuteronomy,12,17,"Nor may you eat within your towns the tithe of your grain, your wine, and your oil, the firstlings of your herds and your flocks, any of your votive gifts that you vow, your freewill offerings, or your donations;"
Deuteronomy,12,18,"these you shall eat in the presence of the Lord your God at the place that the Lord your God will choose, you together with your son and your daughter, your male and female slaves, and the Levites resident in your towns, rejoicing in the presence of the Lord your God in all your undertakings."
Deuteronomy,12,19,Take care that you do not neglect the Levite as long as you live in your land.
Deuteronomy,12,20,"When the Lord your God enlarges your territory, as he has promised you, and you say, “I am going to eat some meat,” because you wish to eat meat, you may eat meat whenever you have the desire."
Deuteronomy,12,21,"If the place where the Lord your God will choose to put his name is too far from you, and you slaughter as I have commanded you any of your herd or flock that the Lord has given you, then you may eat within your towns whenever you desire."
Deuteronomy,12,22,"Indeed, just as gazelle or deer is eaten, so you may eat it; the unclean and the clean alike may eat it."
Deuteronomy,12,23,"Only be sure that you do not eat the blood; for the blood is the life, and you shall not eat the life with the meat."
Deuteronomy,12,24,Do not eat it; you shall pour it out on the ground like water.
Deuteronomy,12,25,"Do not eat it, so that all may go well with you and your children after you, because you do what is right in the sight of the Lord."
Deuteronomy,12,26,"But the sacred donations that are due from you, and your votive gifts, you shall bring to the place that the Lord will choose."
Deuteronomy,12,27,"You shall present your burnt offerings, both the meat and the blood, on the altar of the Lord your God; the blood of your other sacrifices shall be poured out beside the altar of the Lord your God, but the meat you may eat."
Deuteronomy,12,28,"Be careful to obey all these words that I command you today, so that it may go well with you and with your children after you forever, because you will be doing what is good and right in the sight of the Lord your God."
Deuteronomy,12,29,"When the Lord your God has cut off before you the nations whom you are about to enter to dispossess them, when you have dispossessed them and live in their land,"
Deuteronomy,12,30,"take care that you are not snared into imitating them, after they have been destroyed before you: do not inquire concerning their gods, saying, “How did these nations worship their gods? I also want to do the same.”"
Deuteronomy,12,31,"You must not do the same for the Lord your God, because every abhorrent thing that the Lord hates they have done for their gods. They would even burn their sons and their daughters in the fire to their gods."
Deuteronomy,12,32,You must diligently observe everything that I command you; do not add to it or take anything from it.
Deuteronomy,13,1," If prophets or those who divine by dreams appear among you and promise you omens or portents,"
Deuteronomy,13,2,"and the omens or the portents declared by them take place, and they say, “Let us follow other gods” (whom you have not known) “and let us serve them,”"
Deuteronomy,13,3,"you must not heed the words of those prophets or those who divine by dreams; for the Lord your God is testing you, to know whether you indeed love the Lord your God with all your heart and soul."
Deuteronomy,13,4,"The Lord your God you shall follow, him alone you shall fear, his commandments you shall keep, his voice you shall obey, him you shall serve, and to him you shall hold fast."
Deuteronomy,13,5,But those prophets or those who divine by dreams shall be put to death for having spoken treason against the Lord your God—who brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you from the house of slavery—to turn you from the way in which the Lord your God commanded you to walk. So you shall purge the evil from your midst.
Deuteronomy,13,6,"If anyone secretly entices you—even if it is your brother, your father's son or your mother's son, or your own son or daughter, or the wife you embrace, or your most intimate friend—saying, “Let us go worship other gods,” whom neither you nor your ancestors have known,"
Deuteronomy,13,7,"any of the gods of the peoples that are around you, whether near you or far away from you, from one end of the earth to the other,"
Deuteronomy,13,8,you must not yield to or heed any such persons. Show them no pity or compassion and do not shield them.
Deuteronomy,13,9,"But you shall surely kill them; your own hand shall be first against them to execute them, and afterwards the hand of all the people."
Deuteronomy,13,10,"Stone them to death for trying to turn you away from the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery."
Deuteronomy,13,11,"Then all Israel shall hear and be afraid, and never again do any such wickedness."
Deuteronomy,13,12,"If you hear it said about one of the towns that the Lord your God is giving you to live in,"
Deuteronomy,13,13,"that scoundrels from among you have gone out and led the inhabitants of the town astray, saying, “Let us go and worship other gods,” whom you have not known,"
Deuteronomy,13,14,"then you shall inquire and make a thorough investigation. If the charge is established that such an abhorrent thing has been done among you,"
Deuteronomy,13,15,"you shall put the inhabitants of that town to the sword, utterly destroying it and everything in it—even putting its livestock to the sword."
Deuteronomy,13,16,"All of its spoil you shall gather into its public square; then burn the town and all its spoil with fire, as a whole burnt offering to the Lord your God. It shall remain a perpetual ruin, never to be rebuilt."
Deuteronomy,13,17,"Do not let anything devoted to destruction stick to your hand, so that the Lord may turn from his fierce anger and show you compassion, and in his compassion multiply you, as he swore to your ancestors,"
Deuteronomy,13,18,"if you obey the voice of the Lord your God by keeping all his commandments that I am commanding you today, doing what is right in the sight of the Lord your God."
Deuteronomy,14,1,You are children of the Lord your God. You must not lacerate yourselves or shave your forelocks for the dead.
Deuteronomy,14,2,"For you are a people holy to the Lord your God; it is you the Lord has chosen out of all the peoples on earth to be his people, his treasured possession."
Deuteronomy,14,3,You shall not eat any abhorrent thing.
Deuteronomy,14,4,"These are the animals you may eat: the ox, the sheep, the goat,"
Deuteronomy,14,5,"the deer, the gazelle, the roebuck, the wild goat, the ibex, the antelope, and the mountain-sheep."
Deuteronomy,14,6,"Any animal that divides the hoof and has the hoof cleft in two, and chews the cud, among the animals, you may eat."
Deuteronomy,14,7,"Yet of those that chew the cud or have the hoof cleft you shall not eat these: the camel, the hare, and the rock badger, because they chew the cud but do not divide the hoof; they are unclean for you."
Deuteronomy,14,8,"And the pig, because it divides the hoof but does not chew the cud, is unclean for you. You shall not eat their meat, and you shall not touch their carcasses."
Deuteronomy,14,9,Of all that live in water you may eat these: whatever has fins and scales you may eat.
Deuteronomy,14,10,And whatever does not have fins and scales you shall not eat; it is unclean for you.
Deuteronomy,14,11,You may eat any clean birds.
Deuteronomy,14,12,"But these are the ones that you shall not eat: the eagle, the vulture, the osprey,"
Deuteronomy,14,13,"the buzzard, the kite, of any kind;"
Deuteronomy,14,14,every raven of any kind;
Deuteronomy,14,15,"the ostrich, the nighthawk, the sea gull, the hawk, of any kind;"
Deuteronomy,14,16,"the little owl and the great owl, the water hen"
Deuteronomy,14,17,"and the desert owl, the carrion vulture and the cormorant,"
Deuteronomy,14,18,"the stork, the heron, of any kind; the hoopoe and the bat."
Deuteronomy,14,19,And all winged insects are unclean for you; they shall not be eaten.
Deuteronomy,14,20,You may eat any clean winged creature.
Deuteronomy,14,21,"You shall not eat anything that dies of itself; you may give it to aliens residing in your towns for them to eat, or you may sell it to a foreigner. For you are a people holy to the Lord your God. You shall not boil a kid in its mother's milk."
Deuteronomy,14,22,Set apart a tithe of all the yield of your seed that is brought in yearly from the field.
Deuteronomy,14,23,"In the presence of the Lord your God, in the place that he will choose as a dwelling for his name, you shall eat the tithe of your grain, your wine, and your oil, as well as the firstlings of your herd and flock, so that you may learn to fear the Lord your God always."
Deuteronomy,14,24,"But if, when the Lord your God has blessed you, the distance is so great that you are unable to transport it, because the place where the Lord your God will choose to set his name is too far away from you,"
Deuteronomy,14,25,"then you may turn it into money. With the money secure in hand, go to the place that the Lord your God will choose;"
Deuteronomy,14,26,"spend the money for whatever you wish—oxen, sheep, wine, strong drink, or whatever you desire. And you shall eat there in the presence of the Lord your God, you and your household rejoicing together."
Deuteronomy,14,27,"As for the Levites resident in your towns, do not neglect them, because they have no allotment or inheritance with you."
Deuteronomy,14,28,"Every third year you shall bring out the full tithe of your produce for that year, and store it within your towns;"
Deuteronomy,14,29,"the Levites, because they have no allotment or inheritance with you, as well as the resident aliens, the orphans, and the widows in your towns, may come and eat their fill so that the Lord your God may bless you in all the work that you undertake."
Deuteronomy,15,1,Every seventh year you shall grant a remission of debts.
Deuteronomy,15,2,"And this is the manner of the remission: every creditor shall remit the claim that is held against a neighbor, not exacting it of a neighbor who is a member of the community, because the Lord 's remission has been proclaimed."
Deuteronomy,15,3,"Of a foreigner you may exact it, but you must remit your claim on whatever any member of your community owes you."
Deuteronomy,15,4,"There will, however, be no one in need among you, because the Lord is sure to bless you in the land that the Lord your God is giving you as a possession to occupy,"
Deuteronomy,15,5,if only you will obey the Lord your God by diligently observing this entire commandment that I command you today.
Deuteronomy,15,6,"When the Lord your God has blessed you, as he promised you, you will lend to many nations, but you will not borrow; you will rule over many nations, but they will not rule over you."
Deuteronomy,15,7,"If there is among you anyone in need, a member of your community in any of your towns within the land that the Lord your God is giving you, do not be hard-hearted or tight-fisted toward your needy neighbor."
Deuteronomy,15,8,"You should rather open your hand, willingly lending enough to meet the need, whatever it may be."
Deuteronomy,15,9,"Be careful that you do not entertain a mean thought, thinking, “The seventh year, the year of remission, is near,” and therefore view your needy neighbor with hostility and give nothing; your neighbor might cry to the Lord against you, and you would incur guilt."
Deuteronomy,15,10,"Give liberally and be ungrudging when you do so, for on this account the Lord your God will bless you in all your work and in all that you undertake."
Deuteronomy,15,11,"Since there will never cease to be some in need on the earth, I therefore command you, “Open your hand to the poor and needy neighbor in your land.”"

Deuteronomy,15,15,"Remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the Lord your God redeemed you; for this reason I lay this command upon you today."
Deuteronomy,15,16,"But if he says to you, “I will not go out from you,” because he loves you and your household, since he is well off with you,"
Deuteronomy,15,17,"then you shall take an awl and thrust it through his earlobe into the door, and he shall be your slave forever. You shall do the same with regard to your female slave."
Deuteronomy,15,18,"Do not consider it a hardship when you send them out from you free persons, because for six years they have given you services worth the wages of hired laborers; and the Lord your God will bless you in all that you do."
Deuteronomy,15,19,Every firstling male born of your herd and flock you shall consecrate to the Lord your God; you shall not do work with your firstling ox nor shear the firstling of your flock.
Deuteronomy,15,20,"You shall eat it, you together with your household, in the presence of the Lord your God year by year at the place that the Lord will choose."
Deuteronomy,15,21,"But if it has any defect—any serious defect, such as lameness or blindness—you shall not sacrifice it to the Lord your God;"
Deuteronomy,15,22,"within your towns you may eat it, the unclean and the clean alike, as you would a gazelle or deer."
Deuteronomy,15,23,"Its blood, however, you must not eat; you shall pour it out on the ground like water."
Deuteronomy,16,1,"Observe the month of Abib by keeping the passover for the Lord your God, for in the month of Abib the Lord your God brought you out of Egypt by night."
Deuteronomy,16,2,"You shall offer the passover sacrifice for the Lord your God, from the flock and the herd, at the place that the Lord will choose as a dwelling for his name."
Deuteronomy,16,3,"You must not eat with it anything leavened. For seven days you shall eat unleavened bread with it—the bread of affliction—because you came out of the land of Egypt in great haste, so that all the days of your life you may remember the day of your departure from the land of Egypt."
Deuteronomy,16,4,No leaven shall be seen with you in all your territory for seven days; and none of the meat of what you slaughter on the evening of the first day shall remain until morning.
Deuteronomy,16,5,You are not permitted to offer the passover sacrifice within any of your towns that the Lord your God is giving you.
Deuteronomy,16,6,"But at the place that the Lord your God will choose as a dwelling for his name, only there shall you offer the passover sacrifice, in the evening at sunset, the time of day when you departed from Egypt."
Deuteronomy,16,7,You shall cook it and eat it at the place that the Lord your God will choose; the next morning you may go back to your tents.
Deuteronomy,16,8,"For six days you shall continue to eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a solemn assembly for the Lord your God, when you shall do no work."
Deuteronomy,16,9,You shall count seven weeks; begin to count the seven weeks from the time the sickle is first put to the standing grain.
Deuteronomy,16,10,"Then you shall keep the festival of weeks for the Lord your God, contributing a freewill offering in proportion to the blessing that you have received from the Lord your God."
Deuteronomy,16,11,"Rejoice before the Lord your God—you and your sons and your daughters, your male and female slaves, the Levites resident in your towns, as well as the strangers, the orphans, and the widows who are among you—at the place that the Lord your God will choose as a dwelling for his name."
Deuteronomy,16,12,"Remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and diligently observe these statutes."

Deuteronomy,16,15,"Seven days you shall keep the festival for the Lord your God at the place that the Lord will choose; for the Lord your God will bless you in all your produce and in all your undertakings, and you shall surely celebrate."
Deuteronomy,16,16,"Three times a year all your males shall appear before the Lord your God at the place that he will choose: at the festival of unleavened bread, at the festival of weeks, and at the festival of booths. They shall not appear before the Lord empty-handed;"
Deuteronomy,16,17,"all shall give as they are able, according to the blessing of the Lord your God that he has given you."
Deuteronomy,16,18,"You shall appoint judges and officials throughout your tribes, in all your towns that the Lord your God is giving you, and they shall render just decisions for the people."
Deuteronomy,16,19,"You must not distort justice; you must not show partiality; and you must not accept bribes, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and subverts the cause of those who are in the right."
Deuteronomy,16,20,"Justice, and only justice, you shall pursue, so that you may live and occupy the land that the Lord your God is giving you."
Deuteronomy,16,21,You shall not plant any tree as a sacred pole beside the altar that you make for the Lord your God;
Deuteronomy,16,22,nor shall you set up a stone pillar—things that the Lord your God hates.
Deuteronomy,17,1,"You must not sacrifice to the Lord your God an ox or a sheep that has a defect, anything seriously wrong; for that is abhorrent to the Lord your God."
Deuteronomy,17,2,"If there is found among you, in one of your towns that the Lord your God is giving you, a man or woman who does what is evil in the sight of the Lord your God, and transgresses his covenant"
Deuteronomy,17,3,"by going to serve other gods and worshiping them—whether the sun or the moon or any of the host of heaven, which I have forbidden—"
Deuteronomy,17,4,"and if it is reported to you or you hear of it, and you make a thorough inquiry, and the charge is proved true that such an abhorrent thing has occurred in Israel,"
Deuteronomy,17,5,then you shall bring out to your gates that man or that woman who has committed this crime and you shall stone the man or woman to death.
Deuteronomy,17,6,On the evidence of two or three witnesses the death sentence shall be executed; a person must not be put to death on the evidence of only one witness.
Deuteronomy,17,7,"The hands of the witnesses shall be the first raised against the person to execute the death penalty, and afterward the hands of all the people. So you shall purge the evil from your midst."
Deuteronomy,17,8,"If a judicial decision is too difficult for you to make between one kind of bloodshed and another, one kind of legal right and another, or one kind of assault and another—any such matters of dispute in your towns—then you shall immediately go up to the place that the Lord your God will choose,"
Deuteronomy,17,9,where you shall consult with the levitical priests and the judge who is in office in those days; they shall announce to you the decision in the case.
Deuteronomy,17,10,"Carry out exactly the decision that they announce to you from the place that the Lord will choose, diligently observing everything they instruct you."
Deuteronomy,17,11,"You must carry out fully the law that they interpret for you or the ruling that they announce to you; do not turn aside from the decision that they announce to you, either to the right or to the left."
Deuteronomy,17,12,"As for anyone who presumes to disobey the priest appointed to minister there to the Lord your God, or the judge, that person shall die. So you shall purge the evil from Israel."
Deuteronomy,17,13,"All the people will hear and be afraid, and will not act presumptuously again."
Deuteronomy,17,14,"When you have come into the land that the Lord your God is giving you, and have taken possession of it and settled in it, and you say, “I will set a king over me, like all the nations that are around me,”"
Deuteronomy,17,15,"you may indeed set over you a king whom the Lord your God will choose. One of your own community you may set as king over you; you are not permitted to put a foreigner over you, who is not of your own community."
Deuteronomy,17,16,"Even so, he must not acquire many horses for himself, or return the people to Egypt in order to acquire more horses, since the Lord has said to you, “You must never return that way again.”"
Deuteronomy,17,17,"And he must not acquire many wives for himself, or else his heart will turn away; also silver and gold he must not acquire in great quantity for himself."
Deuteronomy,17,18,"When he has taken the throne of his kingdom, he shall have a copy of this law written for him in the presence of the levitical priests."
Deuteronomy,17,19,"It shall remain with him and he shall read in it all the days of his life, so that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, diligently observing all the words of this law and these statutes,"
Deuteronomy,17,20,"neither exalting himself above other members of the community nor turning aside from the commandment, either to the right or to the left, so that he and his descendants may reign long over his kingdom in Israel."
Deuteronomy,18,1,"The levitical priests, the whole tribe of Levi, shall have no allotment or inheritance within Israel. They may eat the sacrifices that are the Lord 's portion"
Deuteronomy,18,2,"but they shall have no inheritance among the other members of the community; the Lord is their inheritance, as he promised them."
Deuteronomy,18,3,"This shall be the priests' due from the people, from those offering a sacrifice, whether an ox or a sheep: they shall give to the priest the shoulder, the two jowls, and the stomach."
Deuteronomy,18,4,"The first fruits of your grain, your wine, and your oil, as well as the first of the fleece of your sheep, you shall give him."
Deuteronomy,18,5,"For the Lord your God has chosen Levi out of all your tribes, to stand and minister in the name of the Lord , him and his sons for all time."
Deuteronomy,18,6,"If a Levite leaves any of your towns, from wherever he has been residing in Israel, and comes to the place that the Lord will choose (and he may come whenever he wishes),"
Deuteronomy,18,7,"then he may minister in the name of the Lord his God, like all his fellow-Levites who stand to minister there before the Lord."
Deuteronomy,18,8,"They shall have equal portions to eat, even though they have income from the sale of family possessions."
Deuteronomy,18,9,"When you come into the land that the Lord your God is giving you, you must not learn to imitate the abhorrent practices of those nations."
Deuteronomy,18,10,"No one shall be found among you who makes a son or daughter pass through fire, or who practices divination, or is a soothsayer, or an augur, or a sorcerer,"
Deuteronomy,18,11,"or one who casts spells, or who consults ghosts or spirits, or who seeks oracles from the dead."
Deuteronomy,18,12,For whoever does these things is abhorrent to the Lord ; it is because of such abhorrent practices that the Lord your God is driving them out before you.
Deuteronomy,18,13,You must remain completely loyal to the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy,18,14,"Although these nations that you are about to dispossess do give heed to soothsayers and diviners, as for you, the Lord your God does not permit you to do so."
Deuteronomy,18,15,The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own people; you shall heed such a prophet.
Deuteronomy,18,16,"This is what you requested of the Lord your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly when you said: “If I hear the voice of the Lord my God any more, or ever again see this great fire, I will die.”"
Deuteronomy,18,17,Then the Lord replied to me: “They are right in what they have said.
Deuteronomy,18,18,"I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their own people; I will put my words in the mouth of the prophet, who shall speak to them everything that I command."
Deuteronomy,18,19,"Anyone who does not heed the words that the prophet shall speak in my name, I myself will hold accountable."
Deuteronomy,18,20,"But any prophet who speaks in the name of other gods, or who presumes to speak in my name a word that I have not commanded the prophet to speak—that prophet shall die.”"
Deuteronomy,18,21,"You may say to yourself, “How can we recognize a word that the Lord has not spoken?”"
Deuteronomy,18,22,"If a prophet speaks in the name of the Lord but the thing does not take place or prove true, it is a word that the Lord has not spoken. The prophet has spoken it presumptuously; do not be frightened by it."
Deuteronomy,19,1,"When the Lord your God has cut off the nations whose land the Lord your God is giving you, and you have dispossessed them and settled in their towns and in their houses,"
Deuteronomy,19,2,you shall set apart three cities in the land that the Lord your God is giving you to possess.
Deuteronomy,19,3,"You shall calculate the distances and divide into three regions the land that the Lord your God gives you as a possession, so that any homicide can flee to one of them."
Deuteronomy,19,4,"Now this is the case of a homicide who might flee there and live, that is, someone who has killed another person unintentionally when the two had not been at enmity before:"
Deuteronomy,19,5,"Suppose someone goes into the forest with another to cut wood, and when one of them swings the ax to cut down a tree, the head slips from the handle and strikes the other person who then dies; the killer may flee to one of these cities and live."
Deuteronomy,19,6,"But if the distance is too great, the avenger of blood in hot anger might pursue and overtake and put the killer to death, although a death sentence was not deserved, since the two had not been at enmity before."
Deuteronomy,19,7,Therefore I command you: You shall set apart three cities.
Deuteronomy,19,8,"If the Lord your God enlarges your territory, as he swore to your ancestors—and he will give you all the land that he promised your ancestors to give you,"
Deuteronomy,19,9,"provided you diligently observe this entire commandment that I command you today, by loving the Lord your God and walking always in his ways—then you shall add three more cities to these three,"
Deuteronomy,19,10,"so that the blood of an innocent person may not be shed in the land that the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance, thereby bringing bloodguilt upon you."
Deuteronomy,19,11,"But if someone at enmity with another lies in wait and attacks and takes the life of that person, and flees into one of these cities,"
Deuteronomy,19,12,then the elders of the killer's city shall send to have the culprit taken from there and handed over to the avenger of blood to be put to death.
Deuteronomy,19,13,"Show no pity; you shall purge the guilt of innocent blood from Israel, so that it may go well with you."
Deuteronomy,19,14,"You must not move your neighbor's boundary marker, set up by former generations, on the property that will be allotted to you in the land that the Lord your God is giving you to possess."
Deuteronomy,19,15,A single witness shall not suffice to convict a person of any crime or wrongdoing in connection with any offense that may be committed. Only on the evidence of two or three witnesses shall a charge be sustained.
Deuteronomy,19,16,"If a malicious witness comes forward to accuse someone of wrongdoing,"
Deuteronomy,19,17,"then both parties to the dispute shall appear before the Lord , before the priests and the judges who are in office in those days,"
Deuteronomy,19,18,"and the judges shall make a thorough inquiry. If the witness is a false witness, having testified falsely against another,"
Deuteronomy,19,19,then you shall do to the false witness just as the false witness had meant to do to the other. So you shall purge the evil from your midst.
Deuteronomy,19,20,"The rest shall hear and be afraid, and a crime such as this shall never again be committed among you."
Deuteronomy,19,21,"Show no pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot."
Deuteronomy,20,1,"When you go out to war against your enemies, and see horses and chariots, an army larger than your own, you shall not be afraid of them; for the Lord your God is with you, who brought you up from the land of Egypt."
Deuteronomy,20,2,"Before you engage in battle, the priest shall come forward and speak to the troops,"
Deuteronomy,20,3,"and shall say to them: “Hear, O Israel! Today you are drawing near to do battle against your enemies. Do not lose heart, or be afraid, or panic, or be in dread of them;"
Deuteronomy,20,4,"for it is the Lord your God who goes with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to give you victory.”"
Deuteronomy,20,5,"Then the officials shall address the troops, saying, “Has anyone built a new house but not dedicated it? He should go back to his house, or he might die in the battle and another dedicate it."
Deuteronomy,20,6,"Has anyone planted a vineyard but not yet enjoyed its fruit? He should go back to his house, or he might die in the battle and another be first to enjoy its fruit."
Deuteronomy,20,7,"Has anyone become engaged to a woman but not yet married her? He should go back to his house, or he might die in the battle and another marry her.”"
Deuteronomy,20,8,"The officials shall continue to address the troops, saying, “Is anyone afraid or disheartened? He should go back to his house, or he might cause the heart of his comrades to melt like his own.”"
Deuteronomy,20,9,"When the officials have finished addressing the troops, then the commanders shall take charge of them."
Deuteronomy,20,10,"When you draw near to a town to fight against it, offer it terms of peace."
Deuteronomy,20,11,"If it accepts your terms of peace and surrenders to you, then all the people in it shall serve you at forced labor."
Deuteronomy,20,12,"If it does not submit to you peacefully, but makes war against you, then you shall besiege it;"
Deuteronomy,20,13,"and when the Lord your God gives it into your hand, you shall put all its males to the sword."
Deuteronomy,20,14,"You may, however, take as your booty the women, the children, livestock, and everything else in the town, all its spoil. You may enjoy the spoil of your enemies, which the Lord your God has given you."
Deuteronomy,20,15,"Thus you shall treat all the towns that are very far from you, which are not towns of the nations here."
Deuteronomy,20,16,"But as for the towns of these peoples that the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance, you must not let anything that breathes remain alive."
Deuteronomy,20,17,"You shall annihilate them—the Hittites and the Amorites, the Canaanites and the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites—just as the Lord your God has commanded,"
Deuteronomy,20,18,"so that they may not teach you to do all the abhorrent things that they do for their gods, and you thus sin against the Lord your God."
Deuteronomy,20,19,"If you besiege a town for a long time, making war against it in order to take it, you must not destroy its trees by wielding an ax against them. Although you may take food from them, you must not cut them down. Are trees in the field human beings that they should come under siege from you?"
Deuteronomy,20,20,"You may destroy only the trees that you know do not produce food; you may cut them down for use in building siegeworks against the town that makes war with you, until it falls."
Deuteronomy,21,1,"If, in the land that the Lord your God is giving you to possess, a body is found lying in open country, and it is not known who struck the person down,"
Deuteronomy,21,2,then your elders and your judges shall come out to measure the distances to the towns that are near the body.
Deuteronomy,21,3,"The elders of the town nearest the body shall take a heifer that has never been worked, one that has not pulled in the yoke;"
Deuteronomy,21,4,"the elders of that town shall bring the heifer down to a wadi with running water, which is neither plowed nor sown, and shall break the heifer's neck there in the wadi."
Deuteronomy,21,5,"Then the priests, the sons of Levi, shall come forward, for the Lord your God has chosen them to minister to him and to pronounce blessings in the name of the Lord , and by their decision all cases of dispute and assault shall be settled."
Deuteronomy,21,6,"All the elders of that town nearest the body shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the wadi,"
Deuteronomy,21,7,"and they shall declare: “Our hands did not shed this blood, nor were we witnesses to it."
Deuteronomy,21,8,"Absolve, O Lord , your people Israel, whom you redeemed; do not let the guilt of innocent blood remain in the midst of your people Israel.” Then they will be absolved of bloodguilt."
Deuteronomy,21,9,"So you shall purge the guilt of innocent blood from your midst, because you must do what is right in the sight of the Lord."
Deuteronomy,21,10,"When you go out to war against your enemies, and the Lord your God hands them over to you and you take them captive,"
Deuteronomy,21,11,"suppose you see among the captives a beautiful woman whom you desire and want to marry,"
Deuteronomy,21,12,"and so you bring her home to your house: she shall shave her head, pare her nails,"
Deuteronomy,21,13,"discard her captive's garb, and shall remain in your house a full month, mourning for her father and mother; after that you may go in to her and be her husband, and she shall be your wife."
Deuteronomy,21,14,"But if you are not satisfied with her, you shall let her go free and not sell her for money. You must not treat her as a slave, since you have dishonored her."
Deuteronomy,21,15,"If a man has two wives, one of them loved and the other disliked, and if both the loved and the disliked have borne him sons, the firstborn being the son of the one who is disliked,"
Deuteronomy,21,16,"then on the day when he wills his possessions to his sons, he is not permitted to treat the son of the loved as the firstborn in preference to the son of the disliked, who is the firstborn."
Deuteronomy,21,17,"He must acknowledge as firstborn the son of the one who is disliked, giving him a double portion of all that he has; since he is the first issue of his virility, the right of the firstborn is his."
Deuteronomy,21,18,"If someone has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey his father and mother, who does not heed them when they discipline him,"
Deuteronomy,21,19,then his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his town at the gate of that place.
Deuteronomy,21,20,"They shall say to the elders of his town, “This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey us. He is a glutton and a drunkard.”"
Deuteronomy,21,21,"Then all the men of the town shall stone him to death. So you shall purge the evil from your midst; and all Israel will hear, and be afraid."
Deuteronomy,21,22,"When someone is convicted of a crime punishable by death and is executed, and you hang him on a tree,"
Deuteronomy,21,23,"his corpse must not remain all night upon the tree; you shall bury him that same day, for anyone hung on a tree is under God's curse. You must not defile the land that the Lord your God is giving you for possession."
Deuteronomy,22,1,You shall not watch your neighbor's ox or sheep straying away and ignore them; you shall take them back to their owner.
Deuteronomy,22,2,"If the owner does not reside near you or you do not know who the owner is, you shall bring it to your own house, and it shall remain with you until the owner claims it; then you shall return it."
Deuteronomy,22,3,You shall do the same with a neighbor's donkey; you shall do the same with a neighbor's garment; and you shall do the same with anything else that your neighbor loses and you find. You may not withhold your help.

Deuteronomy,28,63,"And just as the Lord took delight in making you prosperous and numerous, so the Lord will take delight in bringing you to ruin and destruction; you shall be plucked off the land that you are entering to possess."
Deuteronomy,28,64,"The Lord will scatter you among all peoples, from one end of the earth to the other; and there you shall serve other gods, of wood and stone, which neither you nor your ancestors have known."
Deuteronomy,28,65,"Among those nations you shall find no ease, no resting place for the sole of your foot. There the Lord will give you a trembling heart, failing eyes, and a languishing spirit."
Deuteronomy,28,66,"Your life shall hang in doubt before you; night and day you shall be in dread, with no assurance of your life."
Deuteronomy,28,67,"In the morning you shall say, “If only it were evening!” and at evening you shall say, “If only it were morning!”—because of the dread that your heart shall feel and the sights that your eyes shall see."
Deuteronomy,28,68,"The Lord will bring you back in ships to Egypt, by a route that I promised you would never see again; and there you shall offer yourselves for sale to your enemies as male and female slaves, but there will be no buyer."
Deuteronomy,29,1," These are the words of the covenant that the Lord commanded Moses to make with the Israelites in the land of Moab, in addition to the covenant that he had made with them at Horeb."
Deuteronomy,29,2," Moses summoned all Israel and said to them: You have seen all that the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh and to all his servants and to all his land,"
Deuteronomy,29,3,"the great trials that your eyes saw, the signs, and those great wonders."
Deuteronomy,29,4,"But to this day the Lord has not given you a mind to understand, or eyes to see, or ears to hear."
Deuteronomy,29,5,"I have led you forty years in the wilderness. The clothes on your back have not worn out, and the sandals on your feet have not worn out;"
Deuteronomy,29,6,"you have not eaten bread, and you have not drunk wine or strong drink—so that you may know that I am the Lord your God."
Deuteronomy,29,7,"When you came to this place, King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan came out against us for battle, but we defeated them."

Deuteronomy,29,10,"You stand assembled today, all of you, before the Lord your God—the leaders of your tribes, your elders, and your officials, all the men of Israel,"
Deuteronomy,29,11,"your children, your women, and the aliens who are in your camp, both those who cut your wood and those who draw your water—"
Deuteronomy,29,12,"to enter into the covenant of the Lord your God, sworn by an oath, which the Lord your God is making with you today;"
Deuteronomy,29,13,"in order that he may establish you today as his people, and that he may be your God, as he promised you and as he swore to your ancestors, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob."
Deuteronomy,29,14,"I am making this covenant, sworn by an oath, not only with you who stand here with us today before the Lord our God,"
Deuteronomy,29,15,but also with those who are not here with us today.
Deuteronomy,29,16,"You know how we lived in the land of Egypt, and how we came through the midst of the nations through which you passed."

Deuteronomy,29,18,"It may be that there is among you a man or woman, or a family or tribe, whose heart is already turning away from the Lord our God to serve the gods of those nations. It may be that there is among you a root sprouting poisonous and bitter growth."
Deuteronomy,29,19,"All who hear the words of this oath and bless themselves, thinking in their hearts, “We are safe even though we go our own stubborn ways” (thus bringing disaster on moist and dry alike) —"
Deuteronomy,29,20,"the Lord will be unwilling to pardon them, for the Lord 's anger and passion will smoke against them. All the curses written in this book will descend on them, and the Lord will blot out their names from under heaven."
Deuteronomy,29,21,"The Lord will single them out from all the tribes of Israel for calamity, in accordance with all the curses of the covenant written in this book of the law."
Deuteronomy,29,22,"The next generation, your children who rise up after you, as well as the foreigner who comes from a distant country, will see the devastation of that land and the afflictions with which the Lord has afflicted it—"
Deuteronomy,29,23,"all its soil burned out by sulfur and salt, nothing planted, nothing sprouting, unable to support any vegetation, like the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which the Lord destroyed in his fierce anger—"
Deuteronomy,29,24,"they and indeed all the nations will wonder, “Why has the Lord done thus to this land? What caused this great display of anger?”"
Deuteronomy,29,25,"They will conclude, “It is because they abandoned the covenant of the Lord , the God of their ancestors, which he made with them when he brought them out of the land of Egypt."
Deuteronomy,29,26,"They turned and served other gods, worshiping them, gods whom they had not known and whom he had not allotted to them;"
Deuteronomy,29,27,"so the anger of the Lord was kindled against that land, bringing on it every curse written in this book."
Deuteronomy,29,28,"The Lord uprooted them from their land in anger, fury, and great wrath, and cast them into another land, as is now the case.”"
Deuteronomy,29,29,"The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but the revealed things belong to us and to our children forever, to observe all the words of this law."
Deuteronomy,30,1,"When all these things have happened to you, the blessings and the curses that I have set before you, if you call them to mind among all the nations where the Lord your God has driven you,"
Deuteronomy,30,2,"and return to the Lord your God, and you and your children obey him with all your heart and with all your soul, just as I am commanding you today,"
Deuteronomy,30,3,"then the Lord your God will restore your fortunes and have compassion on you, gathering you again from all the peoples among whom the Lord your God has scattered you."
Deuteronomy,30,4,"Even if you are exiled to the ends of the world, from there the Lord your God will gather you, and from there he will bring you back."
Deuteronomy,30,5,"The Lord your God will bring you into the land that your ancestors possessed, and you will possess it; he will make you more prosperous and numerous than your ancestors."
Deuteronomy,30,6,"Moreover, the Lord your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your descendants, so that you will love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, in order that you may live."
Deuteronomy,30,7,The Lord your God will put all these curses on your enemies and on the adversaries who took advantage of you.
Deuteronomy,30,8,"Then you shall again obey the Lord , observing all his commandments that I am commanding you today,"
Deuteronomy,30,9,"and the Lord your God will make you abundantly prosperous in all your undertakings, in the fruit of your body, in the fruit of your livestock, and in the fruit of your soil. For the Lord will again take delight in prospering you, just as he delighted in prospering your ancestors,"
Deuteronomy,30,10,"when you obey the Lord your God by observing his commandments and decrees that are written in this book of the law, because you turn to the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul."
Deuteronomy,30,11,"Surely, this commandment that I am commanding you today is not too hard for you, nor is it too far away."
Deuteronomy,30,12,"It is not in heaven, that you should say, “Who will go up to heaven for us, and get it for us so that we may hear it and observe it?”"
Deuteronomy,30,13,"Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, “Who will cross to the other side of the sea for us, and get it for us so that we may hear it and observe it?”"
Deuteronomy,30,14,"No, the word is very near to you; it is in your mouth and in your heart for you to observe."
Deuteronomy,30,15,"See, I have set before you today life and prosperity, death and adversity."
Deuteronomy,30,16,"If you obey the commandments of the Lord your God that I am commanding you today, by loving the Lord your God, walking in his ways, and observing his commandments, decrees, and ordinances, then you shall live and become numerous, and the Lord your God will bless you in the land that you are entering to possess."
Deuteronomy,30,17,"But if your heart turns away and you do not hear, but are led astray to bow down to other gods and serve them,"
Deuteronomy,30,18,I declare to you today that you shall perish; you shall not live long in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess.
Deuteronomy,30,19,"I call heaven and earth to witness against you today that I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Choose life so that you and your descendants may live,"
Deuteronomy,30,20,"loving the Lord your God, obeying him, and holding fast to him; for that means life to you and length of days, so that you may live in the land that the Lord swore to give to your ancestors, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob."
Deuteronomy,31,1,"When Moses had finished speaking all these words to all Israel,"
Deuteronomy,31,2,"he said to them: “I am now one hundred twenty years old. I am no longer able to get about, and the Lord has told me, ‘You shall not cross over this Jordan.’"
Deuteronomy,31,3,"The Lord your God himself will cross over before you. He will destroy these nations before you, and you shall dispossess them. Joshua also will cross over before you, as the Lord promised."
Deuteronomy,31,4,"The Lord will do to them as he did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their land, when he destroyed them."
Deuteronomy,31,5,The Lord will give them over to you and you shall deal with them in full accord with the command that I have given to you.
Deuteronomy,31,6,"Be strong and bold; have no fear or dread of them, because it is the Lord your God who goes with you; he will not fail you or forsake you.”"
Deuteronomy,31,7,"Then Moses summoned Joshua and said to him in the sight of all Israel: “Be strong and bold, for you are the one who will go with this people into the land that the Lord has sworn to their ancestors to give them; and you will put them in possession of it."
Deuteronomy,31,8,It is the Lord who goes before you. He will be with you; he will not fail you or forsake you. Do not fear or be dismayed.”
Deuteronomy,31,9,"Then Moses wrote down this law, and gave it to the priests, the sons of Levi, who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord , and to all the elders of Israel."
Deuteronomy,31,10,"Moses commanded them: “Every seventh year, in the scheduled year of remission, during the festival of booths,"
Deuteronomy,31,11,"when all Israel comes to appear before the Lord your God at the place that he will choose, you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing."
Deuteronomy,31,12,"Assemble the people—men, women, and children, as well as the aliens residing in your towns—so that they may hear and learn to fear the Lord your God and to observe diligently all the words of this law,"
Deuteronomy,31,13,"and so that their children, who have not known it, may hear and learn to fear the Lord your God, as long as you live in the land that you are crossing over the Jordan to possess.”"
Deuteronomy,31,14,"The Lord said to Moses, “Your time to die is near; call Joshua and present yourselves in the tent of meeting, so that I may commission him.” So Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves in the tent of meeting,"
Deuteronomy,31,15,and the Lord appeared at the tent in a pillar of cloud; the pillar of cloud stood at the entrance to the tent.
Deuteronomy,31,16,"The Lord said to Moses, “Soon you will lie down with your ancestors. Then this people will begin to prostitute themselves to the foreign gods in their midst, the gods of the land into which they are going; they will forsake me, breaking my covenant that I have made with them."
Deuteronomy,31,17,"My anger will be kindled against them in that day. I will forsake them and hide my face from them; they will become easy prey, and many terrible troubles will come upon them. In that day they will say, ‘Have not these troubles come upon us because our God is not in our midst?’"
Deuteronomy,31,18,On that day I will surely hide my face on account of all the evil they have done by turning to other gods.
Deuteronomy,31,19,"Now therefore write this song, and teach it to the Israelites; put it in their mouths, in order that this song may be a witness for me against the Israelites."
Deuteronomy,31,20,"For when I have brought them into the land flowing with milk and honey, which I promised on oath to their ancestors, and they have eaten their fill and grown fat, they will turn to other gods and serve them, despising me and breaking my covenant."
Deuteronomy,31,21,"And when many terrible troubles come upon them, this song will confront them as a witness, because it will not be lost from the mouths of their descendants. For I know what they are inclined to do even now, before I have brought them into the land that I promised them on oath.”"
Deuteronomy,31,22,That very day Moses wrote this song and taught it to the Israelites.
Deuteronomy,31,23,"Then the Lord commissioned Joshua son of Nun and said, “Be strong and bold, for you shall bring the Israelites into the land that I promised them; I will be with you.”"
Deuteronomy,31,24,"When Moses had finished writing down in a book the words of this law to the very end,"
Deuteronomy,31,25,"Moses commanded the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord , saying,"
Deuteronomy,31,26,“Take this book of the law and put it beside the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God; let it remain there as a witness against you.
Deuteronomy,31,27,"For I know well how rebellious and stubborn you are. If you already have been so rebellious toward the Lord while I am still alive among you, how much more after my death!"
Deuteronomy,31,28,"Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes and your officials, so that I may recite these words in their hearing and call heaven and earth to witness against them."
Deuteronomy,31,29,"For I know that after my death you will surely act corruptly, turning aside from the way that I have commanded you. In time to come trouble will befall you, because you will do what is evil in the sight of the Lord , provoking him to anger through the work of your hands.”"
Deuteronomy,31,30,"Then Moses recited the words of this song, to the very end, in the hearing of the whole assembly of Israel:"
Deuteronomy,32,1,"Give ear, O heavens, and I will speak; let the earth hear the words of my mouth."
Deuteronomy,32,2,"May my teaching drop like the rain, my speech condense like the dew; like gentle rain on grass, like showers on new growth."
Deuteronomy,32,3,For I will proclaim the name of the Lord; ascribe greatness to our God!
Deuteronomy,32,4,"The Rock, his work is perfect, and all his ways are just. A faithful God, without deceit, just and upright is he;"
Deuteronomy,32,5,"yet his degenerate children have dealt falsely with him, a perverse and crooked generation."
Deuteronomy,32,6,"Do you thus repay the Lord, O foolish and senseless people? Is not he your father, who created you, who made you and established you?"
Deuteronomy,32,7,"Remember the days of old, consider the years long past; ask your father, and he will inform you; your elders, and they will tell you."
Deuteronomy,32,8,"When the Most High apportioned the nations, when he divided humankind, he fixed the boundaries of the peoples according to the number of the gods;"
Deuteronomy,32,9,"the Lord 's own portion was his people, Jacob his allotted share."
Deuteronomy,32,10,"He sustained him in a desert land, in a howling wilderness waste; he shielded him, cared for him, guarded him as the apple of his eye."
Deuteronomy,32,11,"As an eagle stirs up its nest, and hovers over its young; as it spreads its wings, takes them up, and bears them aloft on its pinions,"
Deuteronomy,32,12,the Lord alone guided him; no foreign god was with him.
Deuteronomy,32,13,"He set him atop the heights of the land, and fed him with produce of the field; he nursed him with honey from the crags, with oil from flinty rock;"
Deuteronomy,32,14,"curds from the herd, and milk from the flock, with fat of lambs and rams; Bashan bulls and goats, together with the choicest wheat— you drank fine wine from the blood of grapes."
Deuteronomy,32,15,"Jacob ate his fill; Jeshurun grew fat, and kicked. You grew fat, bloated, and gorged! He abandoned God who made him, and scoffed at the Rock of his salvation."
Deuteronomy,32,16,"They made him jealous with strange gods, with abhorrent things they provoked him."
Deuteronomy,32,17,"They sacrificed to demons, not God, to deities they had never known, to new ones recently arrived, whom your ancestors had not feared."
Deuteronomy,32,18,You were unmindful of the Rock that bore you; you forgot the God who gave you birth.
Deuteronomy,32,19,"The Lord saw it, and was jealous he spurned his sons and daughters."
Deuteronomy,32,20,"He said: I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end will be; for they are a perverse generation, children in whom there is no faithfulness."
Deuteronomy,32,21,"They made me jealous with what is no god, provoked me with their idols. So I will make them jealous with what is no people, provoke them with a foolish nation."
Deuteronomy,32,22,"For a fire is kindled by my anger, and burns to the depths of Sheol; it devours the earth and its increase, and sets on fire the foundations of the mountains."
Deuteronomy,32,23,"I will heap disasters upon them, spend my arrows against them:"
Deuteronomy,32,24,"wasting hunger, burning consumption, bitter pestilence. The teeth of beasts I will send against them, with venom of things crawling in the dust."
Deuteronomy,32,25,"In the street the sword shall bereave, and in the chambers terror, for young man and woman alike, nursing child and old gray head."
Deuteronomy,32,26,I thought to scatter them and blot out the memory of them from humankind;
Deuteronomy,32,27,"but I feared provocation by the enemy, for their adversaries might misunderstand and say, “Our hand is triumphant; it was not the Lord who did all this.”"
Deuteronomy,32,28,They are a nation void of sense; there is no understanding in them.
Deuteronomy,32,29,"If they were wise, they would understand this; they would discern what the end would be."
Deuteronomy,32,30,"How could one have routed a thousand, and two put a myriad to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, the Lord had given them up?"
Deuteronomy,32,31,Indeed their rock is not like our Rock; our enemies are fools.
Deuteronomy,32,32,"Their vine comes from the vinestock of Sodom, from the vineyards of Gomorrah; their grapes are grapes of poison, their clusters are bitter;"
Deuteronomy,32,33,"their wine is the poison of serpents, the cruel venom of asps."
Deuteronomy,32,34,"Is not this laid up in store with me, sealed up in my treasuries?"
Deuteronomy,32,35,"Vengeance is mine, and recompense, for the time when their foot shall slip; because the day of their calamity is at hand, their doom comes swiftly."
Deuteronomy,32,36,"Indeed the Lord will vindicate his people, have compassion on his servants, when he sees that their power is gone, neither bond nor free remaining."
Deuteronomy,32,37,"Then he will say: Where are their gods, the rock in which they took refuge,"
Deuteronomy,32,38,"who ate the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their libations? Let them rise up and help you, let them be your protection!"
Deuteronomy,32,39,"See now that I, even I, am he; there is no god besides me. I kill and I make alive; I wound and I heal; and no one can deliver from my hand."
Deuteronomy,32,40,"For I lift up my hand to heaven, and swear: As I live forever,"
Deuteronomy,32,41,"when I whet my flashing sword, and my hand takes hold on judgment; I will take vengeance on my adversaries, and will repay those who hate me."
Deuteronomy,32,42,"I will make my arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh— with the blood of the slain and the captives, from the long-haired enemy."
Deuteronomy,32,43,"Praise, O heavens, his people, worship him, all you gods! For he will avenge the blood of his children, and take vengeance on his adversaries; he will repay those who hate him, and cleanse the land for his people."
Deuteronomy,32,44,"Moses came and recited all the words of this song in the hearing of the people, he and Joshua son of Nun."
Deuteronomy,32,45,"When Moses had finished reciting all these words to all Israel,"
Deuteronomy,32,46,"he said to them: “Take to heart all the words that I am giving in witness against you today; give them as a command to your children, so that they may diligently observe all the words of this law."
Deuteronomy,32,47,"This is no trifling matter for you, but rather your very life; through it you may live long in the land that you are crossing over the Jordan to possess.”"
Deuteronomy,32,48,On that very day the Lord addressed Moses as follows:
Deuteronomy,32,49,"“Ascend this mountain of the Abarim, Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, across from Jericho, and view the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the Israelites for a possession;"
Deuteronomy,32,50,"you shall die there on the mountain that you ascend and shall be gathered to your kin, as your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his kin;"
Deuteronomy,32,51,"because both of you broke faith with me among the Israelites at the waters of Meribath-kadesh in the wilderness of Zin, by failing to maintain my holiness among the Israelites."
Deuteronomy,32,52,"Although you may view the land from a distance, you shall not enter it—the land that I am giving to the Israelites.”"
Deuteronomy,33,1,"This is the blessing with which Moses, the man of God, blessed the Israelites before his death."
Deuteronomy,33,2,"He said: The Lord came from Sinai, and dawned from Seir upon us; he shone forth from Mount Paran. With him were myriads of holy ones; at his right, a host of his own."

Deuteronomy,33,8,"And of Levi he said: Give to Levi your Thummim, and your Urim to your loyal one, whom you tested at Massah, with whom you contended at the waters of Meribah;"
Deuteronomy,33,9,"who said of his father and mother, “I regard them not”; he ignored his kin, and did not acknowledge his children. For they observed your word, and kept your covenant."
Deuteronomy,33,10,"They teach Jacob your ordinances, and Israel your law; they place incense before you, and whole burnt offerings on your altar."
Deuteronomy,33,11,"Bless, O Lord , his substance, and accept the work of his hands; crush the loins of his adversaries, of those that hate him, so that they do not rise again."
Deuteronomy,33,12,Of Benjamin he said: The beloved of the Lord rests in safety— the High God surrounds him all day long— the beloved rests between his shoulders.
Deuteronomy,33,13,"And of Joseph he said: Blessed by the Lord be his land, with the choice gifts of heaven above, and of the deep that lies beneath;"

Deuteronomy,33,15,"with the finest produce of the ancient mountains, and the abundance of the everlasting hills;"
Deuteronomy,33,16,"with the choice gifts of the earth and its fullness, and the favor of the one who dwells on Sinai. Let these come on the head of Joseph, on the brow of the prince among his brothers."
Deuteronomy,33,17,"A firstborn bull—majesty is his! His horns are the horns of a wild ox; with them he gores the peoples, driving them to the ends of the earth; such are the myriads of Ephraim, such the thousands of Manasseh."
Deuteronomy,33,18,"And of Zebulun he said: Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out; and Issachar, in your tents."
Deuteronomy,33,19,They call peoples to the mountain; there they offer the right sacrifices; for they suck the affluence of the seas and the hidden treasures of the sand.
Deuteronomy,33,20,And of Gad he said: Blessed be the enlargement of Gad! Gad lives like a lion; he tears at arm and scalp.
Deuteronomy,33,21,"He chose the best for himself, for there a commander's allotment was reserved; he came at the head of the people, he executed the justice of the Lord, and his ordinances for Israel."
Deuteronomy,33,22,And of Dan he said: Dan is a lion's whelp that leaps forth from Bashan.

Deuteronomy,33,28,"So Israel lives in safety, untroubled is Jacob's abode in a land of grain and wine, where the heavens drop down dew."
Deuteronomy,33,29,"Happy are you, O Israel! Who is like you, a people saved by the Lord, the shield of your help, and the sword of your triumph! Your enemies shall come fawning to you, and you shall tread on their backs."
Deuteronomy,34,1,"Then Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which is opposite Jericho, and the Lord showed him the whole land: Gilead as far as Dan,"
Deuteronomy,34,2,"all Naphtali, the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the Western Sea,"

Deuteronomy,34,4,"The Lord said to him, “This is the land of which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, ‘I will give it to your descendants’; I have let you see it with your eyes, but you shall not cross over there.”"

Deuteronomy,34,6,"He was buried in a valley in the land of Moab, opposite Beth-peor, but no one knows his burial place to this day."
