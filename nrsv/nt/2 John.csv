2 John,1,1,"The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth, and not only I but also all who know the truth,"
2 John,1,2,because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever:
2 John,1,3,"Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Father's Son, in truth and love."
2 John,1,4,"I was overjoyed to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as we have been commanded by the Father."
2 John,1,5,"But now, dear lady, I ask you, not as though I were writing you a new commandment, but one we have had from the beginning, let us love one another."
2 John,1,6,"And this is love, that we walk according to his commandments; this is the commandment just as you have heard it from the beginning—you must walk in it."
2 John,1,7,"Many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh; any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist!"
2 John,1,8,"Be on your guard, so that you do not lose what we have worked for, but may receive a full reward."
2 John,1,9,"Everyone who does not abide in the teaching of Christ, but goes beyond it, does not have God; whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son."
2 John,1,10,Do not receive into the house or welcome anyone who comes to you and does not bring this teaching;
2 John,1,11,for to welcome is to participate in the evil deeds of such a person.
2 John,1,12,"Although I have much to write to you, I would rather not use paper and ink; instead I hope to come to you and talk with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete."
2 John,1,13,The children of your elect sister send you their greetings.
