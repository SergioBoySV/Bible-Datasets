2 John,1,1,"To the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth, and not I only, but also all those who know the truth,"
2 John,1,2,"for the sake of the truth, which remains in us, and will be with us forever:"
2 John,1,3,"Grace, mercy, and peace will be with you from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love."
2 John,1,4,I greatly rejoiced that I found some of your children walking in truth as we were commanded by the Father.
2 John,1,5,"And now I ask you, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment to you, but that which we have had from the beginning, that we love one another."
2 John,1,6,"And this is love: that we walk according to His commandments. This is the commandment, that as you have heard from the beginning, you should walk in it."
2 John,1,7,"For many deceivers, who do not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh, have gone out into the world. Each one is a deceiver and an antichrist."
2 John,1,8,"Watch yourselves, so that we do not lose those things for which we have worked, but that we receive a full reward."
2 John,1,9,Whoever transgresses and does not remain in the teaching of Christ does not have God. Whoever remains in the teaching of Christ has both the Father and the Son.
2 John,1,10,"If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, nor greet him."
2 John,1,11,For whoever greets him takes part in his evil deeds.
2 John,1,12,"I have many things to write to you, but I prefer not to write with paper and ink. Instead, I hope to come to you and speak face to face that our joy may be complete."
2 John,1,13,The children of your elect sister greet you. Amen.
