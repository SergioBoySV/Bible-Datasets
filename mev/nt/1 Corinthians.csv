1 Corinthians,1,1,"Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes, our brother,"
1 Corinthians,1,2,"To the church of God which is at Corinth, to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all who in every place call on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both their Lord and ours:"
1 Corinthians,1,3,Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Corinthians,1,4,I thank my God always on your behalf for the grace of God which has been given to you through Jesus Christ.
1 Corinthians,1,5,"By Him you are enriched in everything, in all speech and in all knowledge,"
1 Corinthians,1,6,"even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you,"
1 Corinthians,1,7,so that you are not lacking in any gift while waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Corinthians,1,8,"He will strengthen you to the end, so that you may be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ."
1 Corinthians,1,9,"God is faithful, and by Him you were called to the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord."
1 Corinthians,1,10,"Now I ask you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak in agreement and that there be no divisions among you. But be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment."
1 Corinthians,1,11,"For it has been declared to me concerning you, my brothers, by those who are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you."
1 Corinthians,1,12,"Now this is what I mean: Every one of you is saying, “I am of Paul,” or “I am of Apollos,” or “I am of Cephas,” or “I am of Christ.”"
1 Corinthians,1,13,Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?
1 Corinthians,1,14,"I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,"
1 Corinthians,1,15,lest any should say that I had baptized in my own name.
1 Corinthians,1,16,"I also baptized the household of Stephanas. Besides them, I do not know whether I baptized any other."
1 Corinthians,1,17,"For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel, not with eloquent words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of no effect."
1 Corinthians,1,18,"For to those who are perishing, the preaching of the cross is foolishness, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God."
1 Corinthians,1,19,"For it is written: “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.”"
1 Corinthians,1,20,Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has God not made the wisdom of this world foolish?
1 Corinthians,1,21,"For since, in the wisdom of God, the world through its wisdom did not know God, it pleased God through the foolishness of preaching to save those who believe."
1 Corinthians,1,22,"For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom."
1 Corinthians,1,23,"But we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to the Jews and foolishness to the Greeks."
1 Corinthians,1,24,"But to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, we preach Christ as the power of God and the wisdom of God."
1 Corinthians,1,25,"For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men."
1 Corinthians,1,26,"For observe your calling, brothers. Among you, not many wise men according to the flesh, not many mighty men, and not many noble men were called."
1 Corinthians,1,27,But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise. God has chosen the weak things ofthe world to confound the things which are mighty.
1 Corinthians,1,28,"And God has chosen the base things of the world and things which are despised. Yes, and He chose things which did not exist to bring to nothing things that do,"
1 Corinthians,1,29,so that no flesh should boast in His presence.
1 Corinthians,1,30,"But because of Him you are in Christ Jesus, whom God made unto us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption."
1 Corinthians,1,31,"Therefore, as it is written, “Let him who boasts, boast in the Lord.”"
1 Corinthians,2,1,"Brothers, when I came to you, I did not come with superiority of speech or wisdom, declaring to you the testimony of God."
1 Corinthians,2,2,For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
1 Corinthians,2,3,I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling.
1 Corinthians,2,4,"My speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,"
1 Corinthians,2,5,"so that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God."
1 Corinthians,2,6,"Yet we speak wisdom among those who are mature, although not the wisdom of this age, nor of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing."
1 Corinthians,2,7,"But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the ages for our glory."
1 Corinthians,2,8,"None of the rulers of this age knew it. For had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory."
1 Corinthians,2,9,"But as it is written, “Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor has it entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for those who love Him.”"
1 Corinthians,2,10,"But God has revealed them to us by His Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God."
1 Corinthians,2,11,"For what man knows the things of a man, except the spirit of man which is in him? Likewise, no one knows the things of God, except the Spirit of God."
1 Corinthians,2,12,"Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, so that we might know the things that are freely given to us by God."
1 Corinthians,2,13,"These things also we proclaim, not in the words which man’s wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual."
1 Corinthians,2,14,"But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned."
1 Corinthians,2,15,But he who is spiritual judges all things. Yet he himself is not judged by anyone.
1 Corinthians,2,16,For “who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct Him?” But we have the mind of Christ.
1 Corinthians,3,1,"Brothers, I could not speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to worldly, even as to babes in Christ."
1 Corinthians,3,2,"I have fed you with milk and not with solid food. For to this day you were not able to endure it. Nor are you able now,"
1 Corinthians,3,3,"for you are still worldly. Since there is envy, strife, and divisions among you, are you not worldly and behaving as mere men?"
1 Corinthians,3,4,"For while one says, “I am of Paul,” and another, “I am of Apollos,” are you not worldly?"
1 Corinthians,3,5,"Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom you believed, even as the Lord gave to each one?"
1 Corinthians,3,6,"I have planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase."
1 Corinthians,3,7,"So then neither is he who plants nor he who waters anything, but God who gives the increase."
1 Corinthians,3,8,"Now he who plants and he who waters are one, and each one will receive his own reward according to his own labor."
1 Corinthians,3,9,For we are laborers together with God: You are God’s vineyard; you are God’s building.
1 Corinthians,3,10,"According to the grace of God which has been given to me, as a wise master builder, I have laid the foundation, but another builds on it. Now let each one take heed how he builds on it."
1 Corinthians,3,11,"For no one can lay another foundation than that which was laid, which is Jesus Christ."
1 Corinthians,3,12,"Now if anyone builds on this foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or stubble,"
1 Corinthians,3,13,"each one’s work will be revealed. For the Day will declare it, because it will be revealed by fire, and the fire will test what sort of work each has done."
1 Corinthians,3,14,"If anyone’s work which he has built on the foundation endures, he will receive a reward."
1 Corinthians,3,15,"If anyone’s work is burned, he will suffer loss. But he himself will be saved, still going through the fire."
1 Corinthians,3,16,"Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?"
1 Corinthians,3,17,"If anyone defiles the temple of God, God will destroy him. For the temple of God is holy. And you are His temple."
1 Corinthians,3,18,"Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you seems to be wise in this world, let him become a fool that he may be wise."
1 Corinthians,3,19,"For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, “He catches the wise in their own craftiness,”"
1 Corinthians,3,20,"and again, “The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.”"
1 Corinthians,3,21,Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours:
1 Corinthians,3,22,"whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come, all are yours,"
1 Corinthians,3,23,"and you are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s."
1 Corinthians,4,1,Let a man so regard us as the ministers of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.
1 Corinthians,4,2,Moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful.
1 Corinthians,4,3,But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by man’s judgment. I do not even judge myself.
1 Corinthians,4,4,For I know nothing against myself. Yet I am not justified by this. But He who judges me is the Lord.
1 Corinthians,4,5,Therefore judge nothing before the appointed time until the Lord comes. He will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will reveal the purposes of the hearts. Then everyone will have commendation from God.
1 Corinthians,4,6,"Brothers, I have figuratively applied these things to myself and to Apollos for your sakes, so that you may learn from us not to think of men above that which is written, and that not one of you would be arrogant for one against another."
1 Corinthians,4,7,"For who makes you differ from another? And what do you have that you did not receive? Now if you received it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?"
1 Corinthians,4,8,"Now you are full, now you are rich; you have begun reigning as kings without us, and I wish to God you reigned, so that we also might reign with you."
1 Corinthians,4,9,"For I think that God has exhibited us, the apostles, last, as if we were sentenced to death. For we have been made a spectacle to the world, to angels and to men."
1 Corinthians,4,10,"We are fools for Christ’s sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are honorable, but we are despised."
1 Corinthians,4,11,"Even to this present hour we both hunger and thirst, and are poorly clothed and beaten and homeless."
1 Corinthians,4,12,"We labor, working with our own hands. Being reviled, we bless. Being persecuted, we endure."
1 Corinthians,4,13,"Being slandered, we encourage. We are made as the filth of the world, and are the refuse of all things to this day."
1 Corinthians,4,14,"I do not write these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you."
1 Corinthians,4,15,"For if you were to have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet you do not have many fathers. In Christ Jesus I have become a father to you through the gospel."
1 Corinthians,4,16,"So I implore you, be followers of me."
1 Corinthians,4,17,"Therefore I have sent Timothy to you. He is my beloved son and is faithful in the Lord. He will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, as I teach everywhere in every church."
1 Corinthians,4,18,"Now some are arrogant, as though I were not coming to you."
1 Corinthians,4,19,"But I will come to you shortly if the Lord wills. And I will know not only what those who are arrogant are saying, but also their power."
1 Corinthians,4,20,"For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power."
1 Corinthians,4,21,"What do you desire? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and in the spirit of meekness?"
1 Corinthians,5,1,"It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and such immorality as is not even named among the Gentiles, that a man has his father’s wife."
1 Corinthians,5,2,"But you are arrogant. Instead you should have mourned, so that he who has done this deed might be removed from among you."
1 Corinthians,5,3,"For indeed, though absent in body but present in spirit, I have already, as if I were present, judged him who has done this deed,"
1 Corinthians,5,4,"in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. When you are assembled, along with my spirit, in the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
1 Corinthians,5,5,"deliver him to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that the spirit may be saved on the day of the Lord Jesus."
1 Corinthians,5,6,Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little yeast leavens the whole batch?
1 Corinthians,5,7,"Therefore purge out the old yeast, that you may be a new batch, since you are unleavened. For even Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed for us."
1 Corinthians,5,8,"Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old yeast, nor with the yeast of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth."
1 Corinthians,5,9,I wrote to you in my letter not to keep company with sexually immoral people.
1 Corinthians,5,10,"Yet I did not mean the sexually immoral people of this world, or the covetous and extortioners, or the idolaters, since you would then need to go out of the world."
1 Corinthians,5,11,"But I have written to you not to keep company with any man who is called a brother, who is sexually immoral, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner. Do not even eat with such a person."
1 Corinthians,5,12,For what have I to do with judging those also who are outside? Do you not judge those who are inside?
1 Corinthians,5,13,But God judges those who are outside. Therefore “put away from among yourselves that wicked person.”
1 Corinthians,6,1,"Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to the law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?"
1 Corinthians,6,2,"Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? If the world will be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?"
1 Corinthians,6,3,Do you not know that we shall judge angels? How much more the things that pertain to this life?
1 Corinthians,6,4,"If then you have judgments dealing with matters of this life, do you appoint as judges those who are least esteemed in the church?"
1 Corinthians,6,5,I speak to your shame. Is it true that there is not even one wise man among you who shall be able to judge between his brothers?
1 Corinthians,6,6,"But brother goes to the law against brother, and before unbelievers, at that."
1 Corinthians,6,7,Now therefore it is already an utter failure for you that you go to law against one another. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?
1 Corinthians,6,8,"But you yourselves do wrong and defraud, and do this to your brothers."
1 Corinthians,6,9,"Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor male prostitutes, nor homosexuals,"
1 Corinthians,6,10,"nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God."
1 Corinthians,6,11,"Such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, and you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus by the Spirit of our God."
1 Corinthians,6,12,"“All things are lawful to me,” but not all things are helpful. “All things are lawful for me,” but I will not be brought under the power of anything."
1 Corinthians,6,13,"“Food is for the belly, and the belly is for food,” but God will destroy both of them. Now the body is not for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body."
1 Corinthians,6,14,God has raised up the Lord and will also raise us up by His own power.
1 Corinthians,6,15,Do you not know that your bodies are the parts of Christ? Shall I then take the parts of Christ and make them the parts of a harlot? God forbid!
1 Corinthians,6,16,"What? Do you not know that he who is joined to a harlot is one body with her? For “the two,” He says, “shall become one flesh.”"
1 Corinthians,6,17,But he who is joined to the Lord becomes one spirit with Him.
1 Corinthians,6,18,Escape from sexual immorality. Every sin that a man commits is outside the body. But he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body.
1 Corinthians,6,19,"What? Do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God, and that you are not your own?"
1 Corinthians,6,20,"You were bought with a price. Therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God’s."
1 Corinthians,7,1,Now concerning the things about which you wrote to me: “It is good for a man not to touch a woman.”
1 Corinthians,7,2,"Nevertheless, because of sexual immorality, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband."
1 Corinthians,7,3,"Let the husband render to the wife due affection, and likewise the wife to the husband."
1 Corinthians,7,4,"The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. Likewise, the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does."
1 Corinthians,7,5,"Do not deprive one another except with consent for a time, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer. Then come together again, so that Satan does not tempt you for lack of self-control."
1 Corinthians,7,6,I speak this as a concession and not as a command.
1 Corinthians,7,7,"For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man has his proper gift from God, one after this manner and another after that."
1 Corinthians,7,8,I say to the unmarried and widows that it is good for them if they live even as I am.
1 Corinthians,7,9,"But if they cannot restrain themselves, let them marry. For it is better to marry than to burn with passion."
1 Corinthians,7,10,"Now to the married I command, not I, but the Lord, do not let the wife depart from her husband."
1 Corinthians,7,11,"But if she departs, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband. And do not let the husband divorce his wife."
1 Corinthians,7,12,"To the rest I speak, not the Lord: If any brother has an unbelieving wife who consents to live with him, he should not divorce her."
1 Corinthians,7,13,"And if the woman has an unbelieving husband who consents to live with her, she should not divorce him."
1 Corinthians,7,14,"For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband. Otherwise, your children would be unclean. But now they are holy."
1 Corinthians,7,15,"But if the unbeliever departs, let that one depart. A brother or a sister is not bound in such cases. God has called us to peace."
1 Corinthians,7,16,"For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife?"
1 Corinthians,7,17,"But as God has given to every man and as the Lord has called every man, so let him walk. This I command in all churches."
1 Corinthians,7,18,Is any man called while circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Is any man called while uncircumcised? Let him not be circumcised.
1 Corinthians,7,19,"Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God is everything."
1 Corinthians,7,20,Let each man remain in the same condition in which he was called.
1 Corinthians,7,21,"Were you called while a servant? Do not worry about it. But if you may become free, do so."
1 Corinthians,7,22,"For he who is called in the Lord while a servant is the Lord’s freeman. Likewise, he who is called while free is Christ’s servant."
1 Corinthians,7,23,You were bought at a price. Do not be the servants of men.
1 Corinthians,7,24,"Brothers, let every man, in whatever condition he is called, remain there with God."
1 Corinthians,7,25,"Now concerning virgins, I have no command from the Lord. Yet I will give my judgment as one who has obtained mercy from the Lord to be faithful."
1 Corinthians,7,26,"I suppose therefore that this is good because of the present distress, that it is good for a man to remain as he is."
1 Corinthians,7,27,Are you committed to a wife? Do not seek to be uncommitted. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife.
1 Corinthians,7,28,"But if you marry, you have not sinned. And if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Nevertheless they will have trouble in this life, but I would spare you that."
1 Corinthians,7,29,"But this I say, brothers, the time is short. It remains that those who have wives should be as though they had none;"
1 Corinthians,7,30,"those who weep, as though they did not weep; those who rejoice, as though they did not rejoice; those who buy, as though they possessed nothing;"
1 Corinthians,7,31,"and those who use this world, as though they did not make full use of it. For the form of this world is passing away."
1 Corinthians,7,32,"But I prefer that you have no concern. He who is unmarried cares for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord."
1 Corinthians,7,33,"But he who is married cares for the things of the world, how he may please his wife."
1 Corinthians,7,34,"There is a difference between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy in body and in spirit. But she who is married cares for the things of the world, how she may please her husband."
1 Corinthians,7,35,"I say this for your own benefit, not to put any restraint upon you, but for what is proper, and that you may serve the Lord without distraction."
1 Corinthians,7,36,"If any man thinks that he is behaving improperly toward his virgin, and if she is past the flower of her youth, and passions so require, let him do what he will. He does not sin. Let them marry."
1 Corinthians,7,37,"Nevertheless he who stands steadfast in his heart without necessity, and has power over his own will, and has so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, does well."
1 Corinthians,7,38,"So then he who gives her in marriage does well, but he who gives her not in marriage does better."
1 Corinthians,7,39,"The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband lives. But if her husband dies, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will, but only in the Lord."
1 Corinthians,7,40,But in my judgment she is happier if she so remains as she is. And I think that I have the Spirit of God.
1 Corinthians,8,1,"Now as concerning food offered to idols: We know that “we all have knowledge.” Knowledge produces arrogance, but love edifies."
1 Corinthians,8,2,"So if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know."
1 Corinthians,8,3,"But if anyone loves God, this one is known by Him."
1 Corinthians,8,4,"So concerning the eating of foods that are offered in sacrifice to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God but one."
1 Corinthians,8,5,"For there are those who are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, as there are many gods and many lords."
1 Corinthians,8,6,"But for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist. And there is one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist."
1 Corinthians,8,7,"However, not everyone has this knowledge. Some, being accustomed to the idol until now, eat the food as a thing offered to an idol. So their weak conscience is defiled."
1 Corinthians,8,8,"But food does not commend us to God. Neither if we eat are we the better, nor if we do not eat are we the worse."
1 Corinthians,8,9,"But take heed, lest by any means this liberty of yours becomes a stumbling block to those who are weak."
1 Corinthians,8,10,"For if anyone sees you, who have knowledge, eating in the idol’s temple, shall the conscience of him who is weak not be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols,"
1 Corinthians,8,11,"and by your knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?"
1 Corinthians,8,12,"When you thus sin against the brothers, wounding their weak conscience, you sin against Christ."
1 Corinthians,8,13,"Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will never eat meat, lest I cause my brother to stumble."
1 Corinthians,9,1,Am I not an apostle? Am I not free? Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord?
1 Corinthians,9,2,"If I am not an apostle to others, yet indeed I am to you. For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord."
1 Corinthians,9,3,This is my answer to those who examine me.
1 Corinthians,9,4,Do we have no right to eat and to drink?
1 Corinthians,9,5,"Do we not have the right to take along a believing wife as do other apostles, the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?"
1 Corinthians,9,6,Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to refrain from working?
1 Corinthians,9,7,"Who goes to war at any time at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard, but does not eat of its fruit? Or who feeds a flock, but does not drink of the flock’s milk?"
1 Corinthians,9,8,Do I say these things as a man? Or does the law not say the same thing also?
1 Corinthians,9,9,"For it is written in the Law of Moses, “You shall not muzzle the mouth of the ox while it treads out the grain.” Is God concerned about oxen?"
1 Corinthians,9,10,"Or does He say it completely for our sake? For our sake, no doubt, this is written so that he who plows should plow in hope, and that he who threshes in hope should partake of his hope."
1 Corinthians,9,11,"If we have sown for you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your material things?"
1 Corinthians,9,12,"If others partake of this right over you, should not we instead? Nevertheless, we have not used this right, but suffer all things, lest we might hinder the gospel of Christ."
1 Corinthians,9,13,Do you not know that those who minister unto holy things live from the things of the temple? And do you not know that those who wait at the altar partake of the altar?
1 Corinthians,9,14,"In the same way, the Lord has ordained that those who preach the gospel should live from the gospel."
1 Corinthians,9,15,"But I have used none of these rights, nor have I written these things that it should be so done to me. For it would be better for me to die than allow anyone to make my boasting void."
1 Corinthians,9,16,"Though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast of, for the requirement is laid upon me. Yes, woe unto me if I do not preach the gospel!"
1 Corinthians,9,17,"So if I do this willingly, I have a reward, but if against my will, I have been entrusted with a commission."
1 Corinthians,9,18,"What is my reward then? Truly that when I preach the gospel, I may present the gospel of Christ without charge, so that I may not abuse my authority in the gospel."
1 Corinthians,9,19,"For though I am free from all men, I have made myself servant to all, that I might win even more."
1 Corinthians,9,20,"To the Jews, I became as a Jew, that I might win the Jews; to those who are under the law, as under the law, that I might win those who are under the law;"
1 Corinthians,9,21,"to those who are outside the law, as outside the law (being not without God’s law, but under Christ’s law) that I might win those who are outside the law."
1 Corinthians,9,22,"To the weak, I became as weak, that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all men, that I might by all means save some."
1 Corinthians,9,23,"This I do for the gospel’s sake, that I might partake of it with you."
1 Corinthians,9,24,"Do you not know that all those who run in a race run, but one receives the prize? So run, that you may obtain it."
1 Corinthians,9,25,"Everyone who strives for the prize exercises self-control in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible one."
1 Corinthians,9,26,"So, therefore, I run, not with uncertainty. So I fight, not as one who beats the air."
1 Corinthians,9,27,"But I bring and keep my body under subjection, lest when preaching to others I myself should be disqualified."
1 Corinthians,10,1,"I would not want you to be unaware that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea,"
1 Corinthians,10,2,and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea;
1 Corinthians,10,3,all ate the same spiritual food;
1 Corinthians,10,4,"and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Christ."
1 Corinthians,10,5,"But with many of them God was not well pleased, and they were overthrown in the wilderness."
1 Corinthians,10,6,Now these things were our examples to the intent that we should not lust after evil things as they lusted.
1 Corinthians,10,7,"Neither be idolaters as were some of them. As it is written, “The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to revel.”"
1 Corinthians,10,8,"Neither let us commit sexual immorality as some of them committed, when twenty-three thousand fell in one day."
1 Corinthians,10,9,"Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted and were destroyed by serpents."
1 Corinthians,10,10,"Neither murmur, as some of them also murmured and were destroyed by the destroyer."
1 Corinthians,10,11,"Now all these things happened to them for examples. They are written as an admonition to us, upon whom the end of the ages has come."
1 Corinthians,10,12,"Therefore let him who thinks he stands take heed, lest he fall."
1 Corinthians,10,13,"No temptation has taken you except what is common to man. God is faithful, and He will not permit you to be tempted above what you can endure, but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that you may be able to bear it."
1 Corinthians,10,14,"So, my beloved, flee from idolatry."
1 Corinthians,10,15,I speak as to wise men. Judge for yourselves what I say.
1 Corinthians,10,16,"The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?"
1 Corinthians,10,17,"For we, being many, are one bread and one body, for we are all partakers of that one bread."
1 Corinthians,10,18,Consider Israel after the flesh: Are not those who eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?
1 Corinthians,10,19,"What am I saying then, that the idol is anything or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is anything?"
1 Corinthians,10,20,"But I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God. I do not want you to have fellowship with demons."
1 Corinthians,10,21,You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot be partakers of the Lord’s table and of the table of demons.
1 Corinthians,10,22,Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than He?
1 Corinthians,10,23,"“All things are lawful for me,” but not all things are helpful. “All things are lawful for me,” but not all things edify."
1 Corinthians,10,24,"Let no one seek his own, but each one the other’s well-being."
1 Corinthians,10,25,"Eat whatever is sold in the meat market, asking no question for the sake of conscience,"
1 Corinthians,10,26,"for “The earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it.”"
1 Corinthians,10,27,"If any of those who do not believe invite you to a feast, and you desire to go, eat whatever is set before you, asking no question for the sake of conscience."
1 Corinthians,10,28,"But if anyone says to you, “This was offered in sacrifice to idols,” do not eat it for the sake of him that mentioned it and for the sake of conscience, for “The earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it.”"
1 Corinthians,10,29,"Conscience, I say, not your own, but that of the other. For why is my liberty judged by another man’s conscience?"
1 Corinthians,10,30,"If I partake with thankfulness, why am I slandered concerning that for which I give thanks?"
1 Corinthians,10,31,"Therefore, whether you eat, or drink, or whatever you do, do it all to the glory of God."
1 Corinthians,10,32,"Give no offense, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God,"
1 Corinthians,10,33,"just as I try to please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved."
1 Corinthians,11,1,Follow me as I follow Christ.
1 Corinthians,11,2,"I praise you, brothers, that you remember me in all things and keep the traditions as I delivered them to you."
1 Corinthians,11,3,"But I would have you know that the head of the woman is the man, the head of every man is Christ, and the head of Christ is God."
1 Corinthians,11,4,"Every man praying or prophesying having his head covered dishonors his head,"
1 Corinthians,11,5,"but every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head, for that is the same as if she were shaved."
1 Corinthians,11,6,"For if the woman is not covered, let her also cut off her hair. But if it is a shame for a woman to have her hair cut off or shaved, let her be covered."
1 Corinthians,11,7,"For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, because he is the image and glory of God. But the woman is the glory of the man."
1 Corinthians,11,8,"The man is not from the woman, but the woman from the man."
1 Corinthians,11,9,"The man was not created for the woman, but the woman for the man."
1 Corinthians,11,10,"For this reason the woman ought to have a veil of authority over her head, because of the angels."
1 Corinthians,11,11,"Nevertheless, neither is the man without the woman, nor the woman without the man in the Lord."
1 Corinthians,11,12,"For just as the woman came from the man, so the man comes through the woman, but all things come from God."
1 Corinthians,11,13,Judge for yourselves. Is it proper for a woman to pray to God uncovered?
1 Corinthians,11,14,Does even nature itself not teach you that if a man has long hair it is a shame to him?
1 Corinthians,11,15,"But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her, for her hair is given her for a covering."
1 Corinthians,11,16,"But if anyone seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor have the churches of God."
1 Corinthians,11,17,"Now in what I have to say to you, I do not praise you. You have come together not for the better, but for the worse."
1 Corinthians,11,18,"First of all, when you come together as the church, I hear that there are divisions among you, and in part I believe it."
1 Corinthians,11,19,For there must also be factions among you so that those who are genuine may become evident among you.
1 Corinthians,11,20,"Therefore when you come together into one place, it is not to eat the Lord’s Supper."
1 Corinthians,11,21,"For in eating, each one eats his own supper ahead of others. One goes hungry, and another becomes drunk."
1 Corinthians,11,22,What? Do you not have houses to eat and to drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and shame those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you in this? I do not praise you.
1 Corinthians,11,23,"I have received of the Lord that which I delivered to you: that the Lord Jesus, on the night in which He was betrayed, took bread."
1 Corinthians,11,24,"When He had given thanks, He broke it and said, “Take and eat. This is My body which is broken for you. Do this in remembrance of Me.”"
1 Corinthians,11,25,"In the same manner He took the cup after He had supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me. ”"
1 Corinthians,11,26,"As often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes."
1 Corinthians,11,27,Therefore whoever eats this bread and drinks this cup of the Lord unworthily will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.
1 Corinthians,11,28,"Let a man examine himself, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup."
1 Corinthians,11,29,"For he who eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body."
1 Corinthians,11,30,"For this reason many are weak and unhealthy among you, and many die."
1 Corinthians,11,31,"If we would judge ourselves, we would not be judged."
1 Corinthians,11,32,"But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord, so that we would not be condemned with the world."
1 Corinthians,11,33,"So, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another."
1 Corinthians,11,34,"If anyone hungers, let him eat at home, so that you may not come together into condemnation. I will set the rest in order when I come."
1 Corinthians,12,1,"Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant."
1 Corinthians,12,2,"You know that you were Gentiles, carried away to these dumb idols, however you were led."
1 Corinthians,12,3,"Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus be cursed!” And no one can say, “Jesus is the Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit."
1 Corinthians,12,4,"There are various gifts, but the same Spirit."
1 Corinthians,12,5,"There are differences of administrations, but the same Lord."
1 Corinthians,12,6,"There are various operations, but it is the same God who operates all of them in all people."
1 Corinthians,12,7,But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to everyone for the common good.
1 Corinthians,12,8,"To one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit,"
1 Corinthians,12,9,"to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healings by the same Spirit,"
1 Corinthians,12,10,"to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, and to another the interpretation of tongues."
1 Corinthians,12,11,"But that one and very same Spirit works all these, dividing to each one individually as He will."
1 Corinthians,12,12,"For as the body is one and has many parts, and all the many parts of that one body are one body, so also is Christ."
1 Corinthians,12,13,"For by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body, whether we are Jews or Gentiles, whether we are slaves or free, and we have all been made to drink of one Spirit."
1 Corinthians,12,14,"The body is not one part, but many."
1 Corinthians,12,15,"If the foot says, “Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body,” is it therefore not of the body?"
1 Corinthians,12,16,"And if the ear says, “Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body,” is it therefore not of the body?"
1 Corinthians,12,17,"If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole body were hearing, where would the sense of smell be?"
1 Corinthians,12,18,"But now God has established the parts, every one of them, in the body as it has pleased Him."
1 Corinthians,12,19,"If they were all one part, where would the body be?"
1 Corinthians,12,20,"So there are many parts, yet one body."
1 Corinthians,12,21,"The eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you,” nor the head to the feet, “I have no need of you.”"
1 Corinthians,12,22,"No, those parts of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary."
1 Corinthians,12,23,"And those parts of the body which we think are less honorable, upon these we bestow more abundant honor. And our less respectable parts are treated with much more respect,"
1 Corinthians,12,24,"whereas our more respectable parts have no need of this. But God has composed the body, having given more abundant honor to that part which lacks it,"
1 Corinthians,12,25,"so that there should be no division in the body, but that the parts should have the same care for one another."
1 Corinthians,12,26,"If one part suffers, all the parts suffer with it, and if one part is honored, all the parts rejoice with it."
1 Corinthians,12,27,Now you are the body of Christ and members individually.
1 Corinthians,12,28,"God has put these in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, and various tongues."
1 Corinthians,12,29,Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all workers of miracles?
1 Corinthians,12,30,Do all have the gifts of healings? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?
1 Corinthians,12,31,But earnestly covet the greater gifts. Yet I show you a more excellent way.
1 Corinthians,13,1,"If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not love, I have become as sounding brass or a clanging cymbal."
1 Corinthians,13,2,"If I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not love, I am nothing."
1 Corinthians,13,3,"If I give all my goods to feed the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, and have not love, it profits me nothing."
1 Corinthians,13,4,"Love suffers long and is kind; love envies not; love flaunts not itself and is not puffed up,"
1 Corinthians,13,5,"does not behave itself improperly, seeks not its own, is not easily provoked, thinks no evil;"
1 Corinthians,13,6,"rejoices not in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth;"
1 Corinthians,13,7,"bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, and endures all things."
1 Corinthians,13,8,"Love never fails. But if there are prophecies, they shall fail; if there are tongues, they shall cease; and if there is knowledge, it shall vanish."
1 Corinthians,13,9,"For we know in part, and we prophesy in part."
1 Corinthians,13,10,"But when that which is perfect comes, then that which is imperfect shall pass away."
1 Corinthians,13,11,"When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, and I thought as a child. But when I became a man, I put away childish things."
1 Corinthians,13,12,"For now we see as through a glass, dimly, but then, face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know, even as I also am known."
1 Corinthians,13,13,"So now abide faith, hope, and love, these three. But the greatest of these is love."
1 Corinthians,14,1,"Follow after love and desire spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy."
1 Corinthians,14,2,"For he who speaks in an unknown tongue does not speak to men, but to God. For no one understands him, although in the spirit, he speaks mysteries."
1 Corinthians,14,3,But he who prophesies speaks to men for their edification and exhortation and comfort.
1 Corinthians,14,4,"He who speaks in an unknown tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church."
1 Corinthians,14,5,"I desire that you all speak in tongues, but even more that you prophesy. For greater is he who prophesies than he who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, so that the church may receive edification."
1 Corinthians,14,6,"Now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you by revelation or knowledge or prophesying or doctrine?"
1 Corinthians,14,7,"Even when things without life give sound, whether flute or harp, how will it be known what is played unless they give a distinction in the sounds?"
1 Corinthians,14,8,"If the trumpet makes an uncertain sound, who will prepare himself for the battle?"
1 Corinthians,14,9,"So also you, unless with the tongue you speak words easy to understand, how will it be known what is spoken? For you shall speak into the air."
1 Corinthians,14,10,"There are, it may be, so many kinds of languages in the world, and none of them is without significance."
1 Corinthians,14,11,"Therefore, if I do not know the meaning of the speech, I shall be a barbarian to him who speaks, and he who speaks will be a barbarian to me."
1 Corinthians,14,12,"So, seeing that you are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that you may excel to the edifying of the church."
1 Corinthians,14,13,Let him who speaks in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.
1 Corinthians,14,14,"For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful."
1 Corinthians,14,15,"What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding. I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding."
1 Corinthians,14,16,"Otherwise, when you bless with the spirit, how will he who occupies the place of the unlearned say “Amen” at your giving of thanks, seeing he does not understand what you say?"
1 Corinthians,14,17,"For you indeed give thanks well, but the other is not edified."
1 Corinthians,14,18,I thank my God that I speak in tongues more than you all.
1 Corinthians,14,19,"Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue."
1 Corinthians,14,20,"Brothers, do not be children in your thinking; rather be infants in evil, but in your thinking be mature."
1 Corinthians,14,21,"In the law it is written: “With men of other tongues and other lips I will speak to this people; but even then they will not hear Me,” says the Lord."
1 Corinthians,14,22,"So tongues are for a sign, not to believers, but to unbelievers. But prophesying does not serve unbelievers, but believers."
1 Corinthians,14,23,"Therefore if the whole church assembles in one place and all speak with tongues, and those who are unlearned or unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your mind?"
1 Corinthians,14,24,"But if all prophesy and there comes in one who does not believe or one unlearned, he is convinced by all and judged by all."
1 Corinthians,14,25,"Thus the secrets of his heart are revealed. And so falling down on his face, he will worship God and report that God is truly among you."
1 Corinthians,14,26,"How is it then, brothers? When you come together, every one of you has a psalm, a teaching, a tongue, a revelation, and an interpretation. Let all things be done for edification."
1 Corinthians,14,27,"If anyone speaks in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and each in turn, and let one interpret."
1 Corinthians,14,28,"But if there is no interpreter, let him remain silent in the church, and let him speak to himself and to God."
1 Corinthians,14,29,"Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others judge."
1 Corinthians,14,30,"If anything is revealed to another that sits by, let the first keep silent."
1 Corinthians,14,31,"For you may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all may be encouraged."
1 Corinthians,14,32,The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.
1 Corinthians,14,33,"For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints."
1 Corinthians,14,34,"Let your women remain silent in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak. They are commanded to be under obedience, as the law also says."
1 Corinthians,14,35,"If they will learn anything, let them ask their husbands at home, for it is a shame for women to speak in the church."
1 Corinthians,14,36,What? Did the word of God come from you? Or did it come to you only?
1 Corinthians,14,37,"If anyone thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him acknowledge that what I am writing you is a command of the Lord."
1 Corinthians,14,38,"But if anyone is ignorant, let him be ignorant."
1 Corinthians,14,39,"Therefore, brothers, eagerly desire to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues."
1 Corinthians,14,40,Let all things be done decently and in order.
1 Corinthians,15,1,"Now, brothers, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which you have received, and in which you stand."
1 Corinthians,15,2,"Through it you are saved, if you keep in memory what I preached to you, unless you have believed in vain."
1 Corinthians,15,3,"For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: how Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,"
1 Corinthians,15,4,"was buried, rose again the third day according to the Scriptures,"
1 Corinthians,15,5,"and was seen by Cephas, and then by the twelve."
1 Corinthians,15,6,"Then He was seen by over five hundred brothers at once, of whom the greater part remain to this present time, though some have passed away."
1 Corinthians,15,7,Then He was seen by James and then by all the apostles.
1 Corinthians,15,8,"Last of all, He was seen by me also, as by one born at the wrong time."
1 Corinthians,15,9,"For I am the least of the apostles and am not fit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God."
1 Corinthians,15,10,"But by the grace of God I am what I am. And His grace toward me was not in vain. I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me."
1 Corinthians,15,11,"Therefore, whether it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed."
1 Corinthians,15,12,"Now if Christ is preached that He rose from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?"
1 Corinthians,15,13,"If there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not risen."
1 Corinthians,15,14,"If Christ has not risen, then our preaching is vain, and your faith is also vain."
1 Corinthians,15,15,"Yes, and we would then be found false witnesses of God, because we have testified that God raised up Christ, whom He did not raise up, if in fact the dead do not rise."
1 Corinthians,15,16,"For if the dead do not rise, then Christ has not been raised."
1 Corinthians,15,17,"If Christ is not raised, your faith is vain; you are still in your sins."
1 Corinthians,15,18,Then they also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
1 Corinthians,15,19,"If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable."
1 Corinthians,15,20,But now is Christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.
1 Corinthians,15,21,"For since death came by man, by man came also the resurrection of the dead."
1 Corinthians,15,22,"For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive."
1 Corinthians,15,23,"But every man in his own order: Christ the first fruits; afterward, those who are Christ’s at His coming."
1 Corinthians,15,24,"Then comes the end when He will deliver up the kingdom to God the Father, when He puts an end to all rule and all authority and power."
1 Corinthians,15,25,For He will reign until He has put all enemies under His feet.
1 Corinthians,15,26,The last enemy that will be destroyed is death.
1 Corinthians,15,27,"For He “has put all things under His feet.” But when He says, “all things are put under Him,” it is revealed that He, who has put all things under Him, is the exception."
1 Corinthians,15,28,"When all things are subjected to Him, then the Son Himself will also be subject to Him who put all things under Him, that God may be all in all."
1 Corinthians,15,29,"Otherwise, what will they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead do not rise at all? Why are they then baptized for the dead?"
1 Corinthians,15,30,And why do we stand in danger every hour?
1 Corinthians,15,31,"I affirm, by the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily."
1 Corinthians,15,32,"If, in the manner of men, I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantage is it to me if the dead do not rise? “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.”"
1 Corinthians,15,33,Do not be deceived: “Bad company corrupts good morals.”
1 Corinthians,15,34,"Awake to righteousness and do not sin, for some do not have the knowledge of God. I say this to your shame."
1 Corinthians,15,35,"But someone will say, “How are the dead raised up? With what body do they come?”"
1 Corinthians,15,36,You fool! What you sow is not made alive unless it dies.
1 Corinthians,15,37,"When you sow, you do not sow the body that shall be, but a bare kernel, perhaps of wheat or of some other grain."
1 Corinthians,15,38,"Then God gives it a body as He pleases, and to each seed its own body."
1 Corinthians,15,39,"All flesh is not the same flesh. There is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fish, and another of birds."
1 Corinthians,15,40,"There are also celestial bodies and terrestrial bodies. The glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another."
1 Corinthians,15,41,"There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars. One star differs from another star in glory."
1 Corinthians,15,42,So also is the resurrection of the dead. The body is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption.
1 Corinthians,15,43,"It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power."
1 Corinthians,15,44,"It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body."
1 Corinthians,15,45,"So it is written, “The first man Adam was made a living soul.” The last Adam was made a life-giving spirit."
1 Corinthians,15,46,"However, that which is spiritual is not first, but the natural, and then the spiritual."
1 Corinthians,15,47,"The first man was of the earth, made of dust; the second man was the Lord from heaven."
1 Corinthians,15,48,"As was the man of dust, so are those who are of dust; and as is the man of heaven, so are those who are of heaven."
1 Corinthians,15,49,"As we have borne the image of the man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the man of heaven."
1 Corinthians,15,50,"Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does corruption inherit incorruption."
1 Corinthians,15,51,"Listen, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed."
1 Corinthians,15,52,"In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet, for the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed."
1 Corinthians,15,53,"For this corruptible will put on incorruption, and this mortal will put on immortality."
1 Corinthians,15,54,"When this corruptible will have put on incorruption, and this mortal will have put on immortality, then the saying that is written shall come to pass: “Death is swallowed up in victory.”"
1 Corinthians,15,55,"“O death, where is your sting? O grave, where is your victory?”"
1 Corinthians,15,56,"The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law."
1 Corinthians,15,57,"But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!"
1 Corinthians,15,58,"Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor in the Lord is not in vain."
1 Corinthians,16,1,"Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given instruction to the churches of Galatia, so even you must do."
1 Corinthians,16,2,"On the first day of the week let every one of you lay in store, as God has prospered him, so that no collections be made when I come."
1 Corinthians,16,3,"And when I come, I will send whomever you approve with your letters to take your generous gifts to Jerusalem."
1 Corinthians,16,4,"If it is fitting that I go also, they will go with me."
1 Corinthians,16,5,Now I will come to you after I pass through Macedonia. For I will pass through Macedonia.
1 Corinthians,16,6,"It may be that I will remain, of course, and spend the winter with you, that you may send me on my journey wherever I go."
1 Corinthians,16,7,"For I do not wish to see you now in passing. Instead, I trust to remain a while with you, if the Lord permits."
1 Corinthians,16,8,But I will remain at Ephesus until Pentecost.
1 Corinthians,16,9,"For a great and effective door has opened to me, and there are many adversaries."
1 Corinthians,16,10,"Now if Timothy comes, see that he may remain with you without fear, for he does the work of the Lord, as I also do."
1 Corinthians,16,11,"Therefore let no one despise him. But send him on his way in peace, that he may come to me. I am expecting him with the brothers."
1 Corinthians,16,12,"As for our brother Apollos, I greatly wanted him to come to you with the brothers. But he was not willing at all to come at this time. However, he will come when he has a convenient time."
1 Corinthians,16,13,"Watch, stand fast in the faith, be bold like men, and be strong."
1 Corinthians,16,14,Let all that you do be done with love.
1 Corinthians,16,15,"You know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves to the ministry of the saints. So I ask you, brothers,"
1 Corinthians,16,16,"that you submit yourselves to such people, and to everyone who helps and labors with us."
1 Corinthians,16,17,"I am happy about the arrival of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus, for they supplied what was lacking on your part."
1 Corinthians,16,18,They have refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore acknowledge these men.
1 Corinthians,16,19,"The churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla greet you heartily in the Lord, with the church that is in their house."
1 Corinthians,16,20,All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
1 Corinthians,16,21,"I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand."
1 Corinthians,16,22,"If anyone does not love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be accursed. Come, O Lord!"
1 Corinthians,16,23,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
1 Corinthians,16,24,My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
