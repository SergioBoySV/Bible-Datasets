Daniel,1,1,"In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it."
Daniel,1,2,"The Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God, and he carried them into the land of Shinar to the house of his god. And he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god."
Daniel,1,3,"The king spoke to Ashpenaz the master of his officials that he should bring some of the sons of Israel and some of the king’s descendants and some of the nobles,"
Daniel,1,4,"youths in whom was no blemish, who were handsome and skillful in every branch of wisdom and gifted with understanding and discerning knowledge, and such as had ability in them to serve in the king’s palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the language of the Chaldeans."
Daniel,1,5,"The king appointed them a daily provision of the king’s food and of the wine which he drank. They were to be educated for three years, that at the end of it they might serve before the king."
Daniel,1,6,"Now among them were of the sons of Judah: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,"
Daniel,1,7,"to whom the commander of the officials gave names. And he gave to Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; to Hananiah, Shadrach; to Mishael, Meshach; and to Azariah, Abednego."
Daniel,1,8,"But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king’s food, nor with the wine which he drank. Therefore he requested of the master of the officials that he might not defile himself."
Daniel,1,9,Now God had brought Daniel into favor and compassion with the master of the officials.
Daniel,1,10,"The master of the officials said to Daniel, “I fear my lord the king who has appointed your food and your drink. For why should he see your faces worse-looking than the youths who are your age? Then you would endanger my head before the king.”"
Daniel,1,11,"Then Daniel said to the steward, whom the master of the officials had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,"
Daniel,1,12,"“Please test your servants for ten days, and let them give us vegetables to eat and water to drink."
Daniel,1,13,"Then let our countenances be looked upon before you, and the countenance of the youths who eat of the portion of the king’s food. And as you see, deal with your servants.”"
Daniel,1,14,So he consented to them in this matter and tested them for ten days.
Daniel,1,15,At the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter than all the youths who ate the portion of the king’s food.
Daniel,1,16,"Thus the guard continued to take away the portion of their food and the wine that they were to drink, and gave them vegetables."
Daniel,1,17,"As for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and skill in every branch of learning and wisdom. And Daniel had understanding in all kinds of visions and dreams."
Daniel,1,18,"Now at the end of the days that the king had set for them to be brought in, the master of the officials brought them in before Neb­uchadnezzar."
Daniel,1,19,"The king spoke with them, and, among them all, none was found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. Therefore they served before the king."
Daniel,1,20,"In all matters of wisdom and understanding which the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm."
Daniel,1,21,Daniel continued even to the first year of King Cyrus.
Daniel,2,1,"And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams, and his spirit was troubled and his sleep left him."
Daniel,2,2,Then the king gave the command to call the magicians and the astrologers and the sorcerers and the Chaldeans to tell the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.
Daniel,2,3,"The king said to them, “I have had a dream, and my spirit is anxious to understand the dream.”"
Daniel,2,4,"Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic, “O king, live forever. Tell your servants the dream, and we will tell the interpretation.”"
Daniel,2,5,"The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, “The command from me is firm: If you will not make known to me the dream with its interpretation, you shall be cut in pieces and your houses shall be made a dunghill."
Daniel,2,6,"But if you tell the dream and its interpretation, you shall receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor. Therefore tell me the dream and its interpretation.”"
Daniel,2,7,"They answered again and said, “Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will tell the interpretation.”"
Daniel,2,8,"The king answered and said, “I know of certainty that you are bargaining for time, because you see that the command from me is firm:"
Daniel,2,9,"If you will not make known to me the dream, there is but one decree for you. For you have agreed to speak lying and corrupt words before me until the circumstance is changed. Therefore tell me the dream so that I know that you can tell me its interpretation.”"
Daniel,2,10,"The Chaldeans answered before the king and said, “There is not a man on the earth who can tell the king’s matter, inasmuch as no great king or ruler has ever asked such things of any magician or astrologer or Chaldean."
Daniel,2,11,"Also, it is a rare thing that the king requires, and there is no one else who can tell it before the king, except the gods whose dwelling is not with flesh.”"
Daniel,2,12,"For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon."
Daniel,2,13,Therefore the decree went out that the wise men should be slain. And they sought for Daniel and his companions to be slain.
Daniel,2,14,"Then Daniel answered with discretion and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king’s guard, who had gone out to kill the wise men of Babylon."
Daniel,2,15,"He answered and said to Arioch the king’s captain, “Why is the decree from the king so urgent?” Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel."
Daniel,2,16,Then Daniel went in and desired of the king that he would give him time in order that he could tell the king the interpretation.
Daniel,2,17,"Then Daniel went to his house and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions,"
Daniel,2,18,"so that they might ask for compassion from the God of heaven concerning this secret, so that Daniel and his companions might not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon."
Daniel,2,19,Then the secret was revealed to Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.
Daniel,2,20,"Daniel answered and said: “Blessed be the name of God forever and ever, for wisdom and might are His."
Daniel,2,21,It is He who changes the times and the seasons; He removes kings and sets up kings; He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those who know understanding.
Daniel,2,22,"He reveals the deep and secret things; He knows what is in the darkness, and the light dwells with Him."
Daniel,2,23,"I thank and praise You, O God of my fathers; for You have given me wisdom and might, and have made known to me now what we asked of You, for You have made known to us the king’s matter.”"
Daniel,2,24,"Therefore Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon. He went and said to him: “Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon. Bring me in before the king, and I will tell the king the interpretation.”"
Daniel,2,25,"Then in haste Arioch brought Daniel before the king and said thus to him, “I have found a man of the captives of Judah who can make known to the king the interpretation.”"
Daniel,2,26,"The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, “Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen, and its interpretation?”"
Daniel,2,27,"Daniel answered in the presence of the king and said, “The secret which the king has demanded, the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, and the soothsayers cannot tell the king."
Daniel,2,28,But there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets and makes known to King Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Your dream and the visions of your head upon your bed are these:
Daniel,2,29,"“As for you, O king, your thoughts came into your mind upon your bed about what would come to pass hereafter, and He who reveals secrets makes known to you what shall come to pass."
Daniel,2,30,"But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living man, but for the purpose of making known the interpretation to the king, and that you might understand the thoughts of your heart."
Daniel,2,31,"“You, O king, were watching, and there was a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before you. And its form was awesome."
Daniel,2,32,"This image’s head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of bronze,"
Daniel,2,33,"its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay."
Daniel,2,34,"You watched until a stone was cut out without hands which struck the image upon its feet, which were of iron and clay, and broke them to pieces."
Daniel,2,35,"Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors. And the wind carried them away so that not a trace of them was found. But the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth."
Daniel,2,36,“This was the dream. Now we will tell its interpretation before the king.
Daniel,2,37,"You, Oking, are the king of kings. For the God of heaven has given you a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory."
Daniel,2,38,"Wherever the sons of men dwell, or the animals of the field, or the fowl of the heavens, He has given them into your hand and has made you ruler over them all. You are the head of gold."
Daniel,2,39,"“After you, another kingdom inferior to you shall arise, and a third kingdom of bronze, which shall rule over all the earth."
Daniel,2,40,"And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron, for iron breaks in pieces and shatters everything; and like iron that crushes, it shall crush and shatter all these."
Daniel,2,41,"As you saw the feet and toes, partly of potters’ clay and partly of iron, the kingdom shall be divided. But there shall be in it some of the strength of the iron, inasmuch as you saw the iron mixed with miry clay."
Daniel,2,42,"As the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken."
Daniel,2,43,"Whereas you saw iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men, but they shall not cleave to one another, even as iron does not mix with clay."
Daniel,2,44,"“In the days of these kings the God of heaven shall set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed. And the kingdom shall not be left to another people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever."
Daniel,2,45,"Inasmuch as you saw that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that it broke in pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold, the great God has made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter. And the dream is certain, and its interpretation sure.”"
Daniel,2,46,"Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and did homage to Daniel, and commanded that they should present an offering and sweet incense to him."
Daniel,2,47,"The king answered Daniel and said, “Truly your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, since you could reveal this secret.”"
Daniel,2,48,"Then the king advanced Daniel and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon."
Daniel,2,49,"Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the affairs of the province of Babylon. But Daniel sat at the court of the king."
Daniel,3,1,"Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was sixty cubits and its width six cubits. He set it up in the plain of Dura in the province of Bab­ylon."
Daniel,3,2,"Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the officials, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up."
Daniel,3,3,"Then the officials, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces were gathered together to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up, and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up."
Daniel,3,4,"Then a herald cried aloud: “To you it is commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages,"
Daniel,3,5,"that at the time you hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of music, you should fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up."
Daniel,3,6,And whoever does not fall down and worship shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.”
Daniel,3,7,"Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, the nations, and the languages fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up."
Daniel,3,8,Therefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near and accused the Jews.
Daniel,3,9,"They spoke and said to King Nebuchadnezzar, “O king, live forever."
Daniel,3,10,"You, O king, have made a decree, that every man who hears the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music should fall down and worship the golden image."
Daniel,3,11,And whoever does not fall down and worship should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
Daniel,3,12,"There are certain Jews whom you have set over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These men, O king, have not regarded you. They do not serve your gods or worship the golden image which you have set up.”"
Daniel,3,13,"Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego be brought. Then they brought these men before the king."
Daniel,3,14,"Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said to them, “Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the golden image which I have set up?"
Daniel,3,15,"Now if you are ready at the time you hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music to fall down and worship the image which I have made, very well. But if you do not worship, you shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. And who is that god who can deliver you out of my hands?”"
Daniel,3,16,"Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said to the king, “O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to give you an answer in this matter."
Daniel,3,17,"If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us out of your hand, O king."
Daniel,3,18,"But even if He does not, be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods, nor worship the golden image which you have set up.”"
Daniel,3,19,"Then Nebuchadnezzar was full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Therefore he spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated."
Daniel,3,20,"He commanded the most mighty men in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and cast them into the burning fiery furnace."
Daniel,3,21,"Then these men were bound in their trousers, their coats, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace."
Daniel,3,22,"Therefore, because the king’s commandment was urgent and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire killed those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego."
Daniel,3,23,"These three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace."
Daniel,3,24,"Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste, and spoke, and said to his counselors, “Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire?” They answered and said to the king, “True, O king.”"
Daniel,3,25,"He answered and said, “But I see four men loose and walking in the midst of the fire, and they are unharmed. And the form of the fourth is like the Son of God!”"
Daniel,3,26,"Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spoke, and said, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, you servants of the Most High God, come out and come here!” Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the midst of the fire."
Daniel,3,27,"The officials, governors, and captains, and the king’s counselors, being gathered together, saw these men upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was a hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor had the smell of fire even come upon them."
Daniel,3,28,"Then Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said, “Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent His angel and delivered His servants who trusted in Him. They have defied the king’s word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God."
Daniel,3,29,"Therefore I make a decree that every people, nation, and language which speaks anything amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill, because there is no other God who can deliver in this way.”"
Daniel,3,30,"Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon."
Daniel,4,1,"Nebuchadnezzar the king, to all peoples, nations, and languages, who dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied to you."
Daniel,4,2,I thought it good to declare the signs and wonders that the Most High God has done for me.
Daniel,4,3,"How great are His signs, and how mighty are His wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and His dominion is from generation to generation."
Daniel,4,4,"I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace."
Daniel,4,5,"I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me."
Daniel,4,6,"Therefore I made a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream."
Daniel,4,7,"Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers, and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known to me its interpretation."
Daniel,4,8,"But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar according to the name of my god and in whom is the Spirit of the Holy God, and before him I told the dream, saying,"
Daniel,4,9,"“Belte­shazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the Spirit of the Holy God is in you and no secret troubles you, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and its interpretation."
Daniel,4,10,"Now these were the visions of my mind while on my bed: I saw a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height was great."
Daniel,4,11,"The tree grew and became strong, and its height reached heaven, and it was visible to the end of all the earth."
Daniel,4,12,"Its leaves were fair, and its fruit much, and in it was food for all. The animals of the field had shadow under it, and the fowl of the heavens lived in its boughs, and all flesh was fed of it."
Daniel,4,13,"“I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and there was a holy watcher coming down from heaven."
Daniel,4,14,"He cried aloud and said thus: ‘Hew down the tree and cut off its branches, shake off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Let the animals get away from under it, and the fowl from its branches."
Daniel,4,15,"Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field. “ ‘And let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let its portion be with the animals in the grass of the earth."
Daniel,4,16,"Let its heart be changed from that of a man, let him be given the heart of an animal. And let seven periods of time pass over it."
Daniel,4,17,"“ ‘This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones, in order that the living may know that the Most High rules over the kingdom of men and gives it to whomever He wills and sets up over it the basest of men.’"
Daniel,4,18,"“This dream I, King Nebuchadnezzar, have seen. Now you, Belteshazzar, tell its interpretation to me, because all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation. But you are able, for the Spirit of the Holy God is in you.”"
Daniel,4,19,"Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonished for a while, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spoke and said, “Belteshazzar, do not let the dream, or its interpretation, trouble you.” Belteshazzar answered and said, “My lord, if only the dream was for those who hate you, and its interpretation for your enemies!"
Daniel,4,20,"The tree that you saw, which grew and became strong, whose height reached to the heavens, and was visible to all the earth,"
Daniel,4,21,"and whose leaves were fair, and its fruit much, and in it was food for all, under which the animals of the field lived, and upon whose branches the fowl of the heavens had their habitation:"
Daniel,4,22,"It is you, O king, who have grown and become strong. Your greatness has grown and reaches to heaven, and your dominion to the ends of the earth."
Daniel,4,23,"“Whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven and saying, ‘Cut the tree down and destroy it, yet leave the stump of its roots in the ground, even with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field. And let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let its portion be with the animals of the field until seven periods of time pass over it’—"
Daniel,4,24,"“This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the Most High, which has come upon my lord the king:"
Daniel,4,25,"You shall be driven away from men, and your dwelling shall be with the wild animals. You shall be given grass to eat like oxen, and wet with the dew of heaven. And seven times shall pass over you, until you have learned that the Most High rules over the kingdom of men and gives it to whomever He chooses."
Daniel,4,26,"Inasmuch as they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots, your kingdom shall be assured to you after you acknowledge that Heaven rules."
Daniel,4,27,"Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you, and break off your sins by righteousness and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor, in case there may be a lengthening of your prosperity.”"
Daniel,4,28,All this came upon King Nebuchadnezzar.
Daniel,4,29,At the end of twelve months he walked on the roof of the palace of the kingdom of Babylon.
Daniel,4,30,"The king spoke, saying, “Is this not Babylon the Great that I myself have built as a royal residence by my mighty power and for the honor of my majesty?”"
Daniel,4,31,"While the word was in the king’s mouth, there fell a voice from heaven: “O King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken: The kingdom has departed from you!"
Daniel,4,32,"And you shall be driven away from men, and your dwelling shall be with the animals of the field. You shall be given grass to eat as oxen, and seven periods of time shall pass over you until you know that the Most High rules over the kingdom of men and gives it to whomever He wills.”"
Daniel,4,33,"Immediately the thing was fulfilled concerning Nebuchadnezzar. And he was driven from men and ate grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven until his hairs were grown like eagles’ feathers and his nails like birds’ claws."
Daniel,4,34,"But at the end of the days, I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up my eyes to heaven, and my understanding returned to me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honored Him who lives forever: For His dominion is an everlasting dominion, and whose kingdom endures from generation to generation."
Daniel,4,35,"And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing; and He does according to His will in the army of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth. And no one can stay His hand or say to Him, “What have You done?”"
Daniel,4,36,"At the same time my reason returned to me. And for the glory of my kingdom, my honor and splendor returned to me. And my counselors and my lords sought me out. Then I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added to me."
Daniel,4,37,"Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of heaven, for all His works are true and His ways just, and those who walk in pride He is able to abase."
Daniel,5,1,Belshazzar the king made a great feast for a thousand of his lords and drank wine before the thousand.
Daniel,5,2,"While he tasted the wine, Belshazzar commanded that they bring in the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple which was in Jerusalem, so that the king, and his officials, his wives, and his concubines might drink from them."
Daniel,5,3,"Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem. And the king and his officials, his wives and his concubines drank from them."
Daniel,5,4,"They drank wine and praised the gods of gold and of silver, of bronze, of iron, of wood, and of stone."
Daniel,5,5,Immediately fingers of a man’s hand appeared and wrote opposite the lampstand on the plaster of the wall of the king’s palace. And the king saw the back of the hand that wrote.
Daniel,5,6,"Then the king’s countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees struck against one another."
Daniel,5,7,"The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. And the king spoke and said to the wise men of Babylon, “Whoever shall read this writing and show me its interpretation shall be clothed with scarlet and have a chain of gold about his neck and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.”"
Daniel,5,8,"Then all the king’s wise men came in, but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king its interpretation."
Daniel,5,9,"Then King Belshazzar was greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his nobles were astonished."
Daniel,5,10,"Now the queen came into the banquet house because of the words of the king and his nobles. And the queen spoke and said, “O king, live forever. Do not let your thoughts trouble you, or let your countenance be changed."
Daniel,5,11,"There is a man in your kingdom in whom is the Spirit of the Holy God. And, in the days of your father, light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, were found in him. And King Nebuchadnezzar, your father, your father the king, made him master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers."
Daniel,5,12,"Inasmuch as an excellent spirit and knowledge and understanding, interpreting dreams and explanation of enigmas and solving of problems, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar, now let Daniel be called, and he will give the interpretation.”"
Daniel,5,13,"Then Daniel was brought in before the king. And the king spoke and said to Daniel, “Are you that Daniel who is one of the sons of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Judah?"
Daniel,5,14,"Now I have heard of you, that the Spirit of God is in you; and that light, and understanding, and excellent wisdom have been found in you."
Daniel,5,15,"Now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing and make known to me its interpretation, but they could not give the interpretation of the matter."
Daniel,5,16,"And I have heard of you, that you can give interpretations and solve problems. Now if you can read the writing, and make known to me its interpretation, you shall be clothed with scarlet and have a chain of gold about your neck and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.”"
Daniel,5,17,"Then Daniel answered and said before the king, “Let your gifts be for yourself, or give your rewards to another. Yet I will read the writing to the king and make known to him the interpretation."
Daniel,5,18,"“O king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father a kingdom and majesty and glory and honor."
Daniel,5,19,"And for the majesty that He gave him, all peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him. Whom he would, he slaughtered, and whom he would, he kept alive; whom he would, he set up, and whom he would, he put down."
Daniel,5,20,"But when his heart was lifted up and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne and they took his glory from him."
Daniel,5,21,"And he was driven from the sons of men, and his heart was made like the animals, and his dwelling was with the wild donkeys. He was given grass to eat like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven until he knew that the Most High God rules in the kingdom of men, and that He appoints over it whomever He wills."
Daniel,5,22,"“Yet you, his son, O Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, though you knew all this;"
Daniel,5,23,"but have lifted up yourself against the Lord of heaven. And they have brought the vessels of His house before you, and you and your lords, your wives and your concubines, have drunk wine in them. And you have praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know. And the God in whose hand is your breath, and whose are all your ways, you have not glorified."
Daniel,5,24,"Then the hand was sent from Him, and this inscription was written."
Daniel,5,25,“This is the inscription that was written:
Daniel,5,26,“This is the interpretation of the message: M ene: God has numbered your kingdom and put an end to it.
Daniel,5,27,T ekel: you have been weighed in the balances and are found wanting.
Daniel,5,28,P eres: your kingdom has been divided and given to the Medes and Persians.”
Daniel,5,29,"Then Belshazzar gave the command, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom."
Daniel,5,30,That same night Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans was slain.
Daniel,5,31,"Then Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about sixty-two years old."
Daniel,6,1,"It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom one hundred and twenty officials, so that they would be over the whole kingdom,"
Daniel,6,2,"and over them three presidents, of whom Daniel was first, so that the officials might give accounts to them and the king not suffer loss."
Daniel,6,3,"Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and officials because an excellent spirit was in him, and the king thought to set him over the whole realm."
Daniel,6,4,"Then the presidents and officials sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom, but they could find no occasion or fault because he was faithful; nor was there any error or fault found in him."
Daniel,6,5,"Then these men said, “We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, unless we find it against him concerning the law of his God.”"
Daniel,6,6,"Then these presidents and officials assembled together to the king, and said to him: “King Darius, live forever!"
Daniel,6,7,"All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the officials, the counselors, and the captains have consulted together to establish a royal statute and to make a firm decree, that whoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, save of you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions."
Daniel,6,8,"Now, O king, establish the decree and sign the writing, that it not be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which may not be altered.”"
Daniel,6,9,"Therefore King Darius signed the writing, even the decree."
Daniel,6,10,"Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house. And his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled on his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he had been doing previously."
Daniel,6,11,Then these men assembled and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God.
Daniel,6,12,"Then they came near and spoke before the king concerning the king’s decree: “Have you not signed a decree, that every man who asks a petition of any god or man within thirty days, save of you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions?” The king answered and said, “The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which may not be altered.”"
Daniel,6,13,"Then they answered and said before the king, “That Daniel, who is of the sons of the captivity of Judah, does not regard you, O king, or the decree that you have signed, but makes his petition three times a day.”"
Daniel,6,14,"Then the king, when he heard these words, was sorely displeased with himself and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him. And he labored until sunset to deliver him."
Daniel,6,15,"Then these men came by agreement to the king and said to the king, “Know, O king, that it is the law of the Medes and Persians that no decree or statute which the king establishes may be changed.”"
Daniel,6,16,"Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spoke and said to Daniel, “Your God whom you serve continually, He will deliver you.”"
Daniel,6,17,"A stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet and with the signet of his lords so that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel."
Daniel,6,18,"Then the king went to his palace and passed the night fasting, and no instruments of music were brought before him. And his sleep fled from him."
Daniel,6,19,Then the king arose very early in the morning and went in haste to the den of lions.
Daniel,6,20,"When he came to the den, he cried with a voice full of sorrow to Daniel. And the king spoke and said to Daniel, “Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God whom you serve continually been able to deliver you from the lions?”"
Daniel,6,21,"Then Daniel said to the king, “O king, live forever!"
Daniel,6,22,"My God has sent His angel and has shut the lions’ mouths so that they have not hurt me, because innocence was found in me before Him; and also before you, O king, I have done no harm.”"
Daniel,6,23,"Then the king was exceeding glad for him and commanded that they take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of harm was found on him, because he believed in his God."
Daniel,6,24,"Then the king commanded, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions—them, their children, and their wives. And the lions overpowered them and broke all their bones in pieces before they came to the bottom of the den."
Daniel,6,25,"Then King Darius wrote: To all peoples, nations, and languages that dwell in all the earth: “Peace be multiplied unto you."
Daniel,6,26,"“I make a decree that in every dominion of my kingdom men are to fear and tremble before the God of Daniel. “For He is the living God, enduring forever; His kingdom shall never be destroyed, and His dominion shall be forever."
Daniel,6,27,"He delivers and rescues, and He works signs and wonders in heaven and on earth, who has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.”"
Daniel,6,28,So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
Daniel,7,1,"In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream and visions of his mind while on his bed. Then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters."
Daniel,7,2,Daniel spoke and said: I saw in my vision by night the four winds of the heaven striving upon the Mediterranean Sea.
Daniel,7,3,"Four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse from one another."
Daniel,7,4,"The first was like a lion and had eagle’s wings. I watched until its wings were plucked and it was lifted up from the earth and made to stand on the feet as a man, and a man’s heart was given to it."
Daniel,7,5,"Another beast appeared, a second, like a bear, and it raised itself up on one side, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. And they said to it, “Arise, devour much flesh.”"
Daniel,7,6,"After this I looked and there was another, like a leopard, which had on its back four wings of a fowl. The beast also had four heads. And dominion was given to it."
Daniel,7,7,"After this I saw in the visions at night a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and exceedingly strong. And it had great iron teeth. It devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the rest with its feet. And it was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns."
Daniel,7,8,"I considered the horns, when there came up among them another little horn before whom three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots. And there, in this horn, were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things."
Daniel,7,9,"I watched until the thrones were cast down and the Ancient of Days was seated, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of His head like the pure wool. His throne was like the fiery flame, and its wheels as burning fire."
Daniel,7,10,"A fiery stream issued and came out from before Him. A thousand thousands ministered to Him; and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him. The judgment was set, and the books were opened."
Daniel,7,11,"Then I watched because of the sound of the boastful words which the horn was speaking. I watched even until the beast was slain, and his body destroyed and given to the burning flame."
Daniel,7,12,"As for the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away; yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time."
Daniel,7,13,"I saw in the night visions, and there was one like a Son of Man coming with the clouds of heaven. He came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before Him."
Daniel,7,14,"There was given to Him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed."
Daniel,7,15,"I, Daniel, was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me."
Daniel,7,16,I approached one of those who were standing by and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me and made known to me the interpretation of these things.
Daniel,7,17,"“These great beasts, which are four, are four kings which shall arise out of the earth."
Daniel,7,18,"But the saints of the Most High shall take the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever, even forever and ever.”"
Daniel,7,19,"Then I desired to know the truth of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron and its nails of bronze, and which devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped the rest with its feet;"
Daniel,7,20,"and of the ten horns that were in its head, and of the other which came up, and before whom three fell, even of that horn that had eyes and a mouth that spoke boastful words, whose look was more stout than its fellows."
Daniel,7,21,"I beheld, and the same horn was warring with the saints and prevailing against them"
Daniel,7,22,"until the Ancient of Days came, and judgment was passed in favor of the saints of the Most High, and the time came when the saints possessed the kingdom."
Daniel,7,23,"Thus he said: “The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be different from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth and shall tread it down and break it in pieces."
Daniel,7,24,"The ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise; and another shall rise after them, and he shall be different from the first, and he shall subdue three kings."
Daniel,7,25,He shall speak words against the Most High and shall wear out the saints of the Most High and plan to change times and law. And they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time.
Daniel,7,26,"“But the court shall sit for judgment, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it forever."
Daniel,7,27,"Then the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of all the kingdoms under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey Him.”"
Daniel,7,28,"At this point the matter ended. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts troubled me much, and my countenance changed in me; but I kept the matter in my heart."
Daniel,8,1,"In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar a vision appeared to me, even to me Daniel, after that which appeared to me at the first."
Daniel,8,2,"I saw in the vision, and while I was looking, I was at Susa in the palace which is in the province of Elam. And I saw in the vision that I was by the canal of Ulai."
Daniel,8,3,"Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and there stood before the river a ram which had two horns, and the two horns were high. But one was higher than the other, and the higher one came up last."
Daniel,8,4,"I saw the ram pushing westward and northward and southward, so that no animal might stand before him; nor was there any that could deliver out of his hand, but he did according to his will and became great."
Daniel,8,5,"As I was considering this, suddenly a male goat came from the west across the face of the whole earth and did not touch the ground. And the goat had a notable horn between his eyes."
Daniel,8,6,"He came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran to him in the fury of his power."
Daniel,8,7,"I saw him come close to the ram, and he was moved with rage against him, and struck the ram and broke his two horns. And there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground and stamped on him. And there was none who could deliver the ram out of his hand."
Daniel,8,8,"Therefore the male goat grew very great. And when he was strong, the great horn was broken, and four conspicuous horns came up in its place toward the four winds of heaven."
Daniel,8,9,"Out of one of them came a little horn, which grew exceedingly great toward the south, toward the east, and toward the Pleasant Land."
Daniel,8,10,"It grew great, even to the host of heaven. And it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground and stamped upon them."
Daniel,8,11,"Indeed, he magnified himself even to the Prince of the host, and from Him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of His sanctuary was cast down."
Daniel,8,12,"Because of rebellion, an army was given to the horn to oppose the daily sacrifice; and it cast truth to the ground. It practiced this and prospered."
Daniel,8,13,"Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said to that certain saint which spoke, “How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice and the transgression of desolation, the giving of both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?”"
Daniel,8,14,"And he said to me, “For two thousand three hundred evenings and mornings. Then the sanctuary shall be cleansed properly.”"
Daniel,8,15,"When I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought for the meaning. Then there before me stood one who had the appearance of a man."
Daniel,8,16,"I heard a man’s voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said, “Gabriel, make this man understand the vision.”"
Daniel,8,17,"So he came near where I stood. And when he came, I was afraid and fell upon my face; but he said to me, “Understand, son of man, that the vision deals with the time of the end.”"
Daniel,8,18,"Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep with my face toward the ground. But he touched me and set me upright."
Daniel,8,19,"He said, “Listen, I will make you know what shall be in the final period of the indignation, for the end shall be at the appointed time."
Daniel,8,20,The ram which you saw having two horns represents the kings of Media and Persia.
Daniel,8,21,"The rough goat is the king of Greece, and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king."
Daniel,8,22,"Now the broken horn and the four horns that stood up in its place are four kingdoms that shall stand up out of his nation, but not with his power."
Daniel,8,23,"“In the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors have reached their limit, a king will arise, having a fierce countenance, skilled in intrigue."
Daniel,8,24,"His power shall be mighty, but not by his own power. And he shall destroy wonderfully and shall prosper and practice his will and shall destroy the mighty men and the holy people."
Daniel,8,25,"By his cunning, he shall cause deceit to succeed under his hand, and he shall magnify himself in his heart. He shall destroy many in a time of peace. He shall also rise up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken, not by human hands."
Daniel,8,26,"“And the vision of the evenings and the mornings, which was told, is true. Therefore shut up the vision, for it deals with many days in the future .”"
Daniel,8,27,"Then I, Daniel, fainted and was sick for some days. Afterward I rose up again and did the king’s business. So I was astonished at the vision, but there was none to explain it."
Daniel,9,1,"In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus of the lineage of the Medes, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans,"
Daniel,9,2,"in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, observed in the books the number of the years which were specified by the word of the Lord to Jeremiah the prophet for the accomplishment of the desolations of Jerusalem, that is, seventy years."
Daniel,9,3,I set my face toward the Lord God to seek by prayer and supplications with fasting and sackcloth and ashes.
Daniel,9,4,"And I prayed to the Lord my God, and made my confession, and said, “Alas, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping His covenant and mercy to those who love Him, and to those who keep His commandments."
Daniel,9,5,"We have sinned and have committed iniquity and have done wickedly and have rebelled, even by departing from Your precepts and from Your judgments."
Daniel,9,6,"We have not listened to Your servants the prophets, who spoke in Your name to our kings, our officials, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land."
Daniel,9,7,"“O Lord, righteousness belongs to You, but to us shame of face, as it is this day, to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to all Israel, who are near and who are far off, through all the countries wherever You have driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against You."
Daniel,9,8,"O Lord, to us belongs shame of face, to our kings, to our officials, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against You."
Daniel,9,9,"To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgiveness, though we have rebelled against Him."
Daniel,9,10,"We have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in His laws, which He set before us by His servants the prophets."
Daniel,9,11,"Indeed, all Israel has transgressed Your law, even by departing that they might not obey Your voice. “Therefore the curse has been poured upon us, and the oath that is written in the Law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against Him."
Daniel,9,12,"He has confirmed His words, which He had spoken against us and against our judges who judged us, by bringing on us great calamity. For under the whole heaven there has not been done such as has been done to Jerusalem."
Daniel,9,13,"As it is written in the Law of Moses, great calamity has come on us. Yet we have not sought the favor of the Lord our God so that we might turn from our iniquities and give attention to Your truth."
Daniel,9,14,"Therefore, the Lord has kept the disaster in store and brought it upon us. For the Lord our God is righteous in all His works which He does, but we have not obeyed His voice."
Daniel,9,15,"“Now, O Lord our God, who brought Your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and made Yourself a name, even to this day, we have sinned, we have done wickedly."
Daniel,9,16,"O Lord, according to all Your righteousness, I beseech You, let Your anger and Your fury be turned away from Your city Jerusalem, Your holy mountain, because for our sins and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and Your people have become a reproach to all who are around us."
Daniel,9,17,"“Now therefore, O God, hear the prayer of Your servant and his supplications, and for Your sake, O Lord, cause Your face to shine upon Your sanctuary, which is desolate."
Daniel,9,18,"O my God, incline Your ear and hear. Open Your eyes and look at our desolations and the city which is called by Your name, for we do not present our supplications before You for our righteousness, but for Your great mercies."
Daniel,9,19,"O Lord, hear! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, listen and act! Do not defer, for Your own sake, O my God. For Your city and Your people are called by Your name.”"
Daniel,9,20,"While I was speaking and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God for the holy mountain of my God,"
Daniel,9,21,"indeed, while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation."
Daniel,9,22,"He informed me and talked with me, and said, “Daniel, I have now come to give you insight and understanding."
Daniel,9,23,"At the beginning of your supplications the command went out, and I have come to tell you, for you are greatly beloved. Therefore understand the matter and consider the vision:"
Daniel,9,24,"“Seventy weeks have been determined for your people and upon your holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make atonement for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the Most Holy Place."
Daniel,9,25,"“Know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the command to restore and to rebuild Jerusalem until the Prince Messiah shall be seven weeks, and sixty-two weeks. It shall be built again, with plaza and moat, even in times of trouble."
Daniel,9,26,After the sixty-two weeks Messiah shall be cut off and shall have nothing. And the troops of the prince who shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end of it shall come with a flood. And until the end of the war desolations are determined.
Daniel,9,27,"And he shall make a firm covenant with many for one week. But in the middle of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the offering to cease. And on the wing of abominations shall come one who makes desolate, until the decreed destruction is poured out on the desolator.”"
Daniel,10,1,"In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a message was revealed to Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar, and the message was true and one of great conflict. And he understood the message and had understanding of the vision."
Daniel,10,2,"In those days I, Daniel, was mourning three full weeks."
Daniel,10,3,"I ate no tasty food, no meat or wine entered my mouth, nor did I anoint myself at all until three whole weeks were fulfilled."
Daniel,10,4,"On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river which is Tigris,"
Daniel,10,5,"I lifted up my eyes and looked and saw a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with the fine gold of Uphaz."
Daniel,10,6,"His body also was like beryl, and his face had the appearance of lightning, and his eyes were like lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet were like the gleam of polished bronze, and the sound of his words like the sound of a tumult."
Daniel,10,7,"I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, while the men who were with me did not see the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves."
Daniel,10,8,"Therefore I was left alone and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me, and my countenance grew deathly pale, and I retained no strength."
Daniel,10,9,"Yet I heard the sound of his words; and while I heard the sound of his words, then I was in a deep sleep on my face with my face toward the ground."
Daniel,10,10,"But then a hand touched me, which set me on my knees and on the palms of my hands."
Daniel,10,11,"He said to me, “O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak to you, and stand upright, for I have been sent to you now.” And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood trembling."
Daniel,10,12,"Then he said to me, “Do not be afraid, Daniel. For from the first day that you set your heart to understand this and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come because of your words."
Daniel,10,13,"But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me for twenty-one days. So Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, for I had been left there with the kings of Persia."
Daniel,10,14,Now I have come to make you understand what shall befall your people in the latter days. For the vision is yet for many days.”
Daniel,10,15,"When he had spoken such words to me, I set my face toward the ground, and I became mute."
Daniel,10,16,"Then one in the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth and spoke and said to him who stood before me, “O my lord, because of the vision, sorrows have come upon me, and I have retained no strength."
Daniel,10,17,"How can the servant of my lord talk with you, my lord? And as for me, there remains no strength in me now, nor is there any breath left in me.”"
Daniel,10,18,"Then again, the one having the appearance of a man came and touched me, and he strengthened me."
Daniel,10,19,"He said, “O man, greatly beloved, do not fear. Peace be unto you. Be strong and courageous!” When he spoke to me, I was strengthened and said, “Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me.”"
Daniel,10,20,"Then he said, “Do you understand why I have come to you? But now I shall return to fight against the prince of Persia, and when I have gone forth, then truly the prince of Greece will come."
Daniel,10,21,"But I will show you what is inscribed in the Scripture of Truth. Yet there is no one who stands firmly with me against these forces, except Michael your prince."
Daniel,11,1,"#“Also, in the first year of Darius the Mede, I, even I, stood to confirm and to strengthen him."
Daniel,11,2,"“And now I will tell you the truth. Truly, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia, and the fourth shall be far richer than all of them; and by his strength, through his riches, he shall stir up all against the realm of Greece."
Daniel,11,3,A mighty king shall stand up who shall rule with great dominion and do according to his will.
Daniel,11,4,"When he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven, but not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled. For his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others besides them."
Daniel,11,5,"“The king of the South shall be strong, as well as one of his officials who shall be strong above him and have dominion. His dominion shall be a great dominion."
Daniel,11,6,"In the end of some years they shall join themselves together. For the king’s daughter of the South shall come to the king of the North to make an agreement. But she shall not retain her position of power, and neither he nor his power shall stand. But she shall be given up with those who brought her and with him who fathered her and with him who strengthened her in those times."
Daniel,11,7,"“But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his place, who shall come with an army and shall enter the fortress of the king of the North and shall deal against them and shall prevail."
Daniel,11,8,"And he shall also carry captive into Egypt their gods, with their officials, and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold. And he shall continue more years than the king of the North,"
Daniel,11,9,"who will enter the kingdom of the king of the South, but shall return to his own land."
Daniel,11,10,"His sons shall wage war and assemble a multitude of armed forces. One shall advance like a flood and pass through, and again shall wage the war as far as his fortress."
Daniel,11,11,"“The king of the South shall be moved with rage, and shall go out and fight with him, with the king of the North, who shall raise a great multitude; but that multitude shall be given into his enemy’s hand."
Daniel,11,12,"When he has taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted up; and he shall cast down many ten thousands, but he shall not be strengthened by it."
Daniel,11,13,"For the king of the North shall return and shall raise a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much equipment."
Daniel,11,14,"“In those times many shall stand up against the king of the South. Also the ­robbers of your people shall exalt themselves to fulfill the vision, but they shall fall."
Daniel,11,15,Then the king of the North shall come and set up a siege mound and capture a fortified city. And the forces of the South shall not withstand him; neither shall his chosen best troops have strength to resist.
Daniel,11,16,"But he who comes against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him. And he shall stand in the Pleasant Land, which shall be consumed by his hand."
Daniel,11,17,"He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, bringing with him a proposal of peace which he shall put into effect. And he shall give him the daughter of women to corrupt it. But she shall not stand on his side or be for him."
Daniel,11,18,"After this he shall turn his face to the coastlands and shall capture many. But a commander shall put a stop to his reproach against him, and he shall repay him for his reproach."
Daniel,11,19,"Then he shall turn his face toward the fortresses of his own land, but shall stumble and fall and not be found any more."
Daniel,11,20,"“Then one shall stand up in his place who shall send an oppressor in the glory of his kingdom. But within a few days he shall be destroyed, but not in anger or in battle."
Daniel,11,21,"“In his place a vile person shall stand up, to whom they shall not give the honor of the kingdom. But he shall come in peaceably and obtain the kingdom by flatteries."
Daniel,11,22,"A flood of armies shall be swept away before him and be broken, and the prince of the covenant as well."
Daniel,11,23,"After the league is made with him, he shall work deceitfully, and he shall come up and shall become strong with a small force of people."
Daniel,11,24,"He shall enter peaceably even upon the richest places of the realm. And he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers’ fathers. He shall distribute among them the plunder and spoil and riches. And he shall plan his devices against the strongholds, but only for a time."
Daniel,11,25,"“He shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the South with a great army. And the king of the South shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army. But he shall not stand, for schemes shall be devised against him."
Daniel,11,26,"Indeed, those who eat his choice food shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow, and many shall fall down slain."
Daniel,11,27,"As for both of these kings, their hearts shall plan on mischief, and they shall speak lies to one another at one table. But it shall not prosper, for the end shall yet be at the appointed time."
Daniel,11,28,"While turning back to his land with great wealth, his heart shall be against the holy covenant. He shall wage war and turn back to his own land."
Daniel,11,29,"“At the appointed time he shall return and come into the south, but this latter time shall not be as the former."
Daniel,11,30,For the ships of Kittim shall come against him. Therefore he shall be grieved and return and have indignation against the holy covenant and take action. He shall even return and show regard to those who forsake the holy covenant.
Daniel,11,31,“His armies shall rise up and desecrate the sanctuary fortress. They shall abolish the daily sacrifice and set up the abomination that makes desolate.
Daniel,11,32,By flatteries he will corrupt those who act wickedly toward the covenant. But the people who know their God will be strong and take action.
Daniel,11,33,"“The wise among the people shall instruct many. Yet for many days they shall fall by the sword and by flame, by captivity and by destruction."
Daniel,11,34,"Now when they fall, they shall be given a little help. But many shall cleave to them with flatteries."
Daniel,11,35,"Some of the wise will fall, so that they may be purged, purified, and made white,until the time of the end, for it is still for the appointed time."
Daniel,11,36,"“The king shall do according to his will. And he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak blasphemous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper until the indignation is accomplished. For that which is determined shall be done."
Daniel,11,37,"He shall regard neither the gods of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god; for he shall magnify himself above them all."
Daniel,11,38,"But instead he shall honor the god of forces, a god whom his fathers did not know. He shall honor him with gold and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things."
Daniel,11,39,"Thus he shall do in the strongest of fortresses with a foreign god. He shall give great honor to those who acknowledge him, and shall cause them to rule over the many and shall divide the land for gain."
Daniel,11,40,"“At the time of the end the king of the South shall push at him. But the king of the North shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots and with horsemen and with many ships. And he shall enter the countries and shall overflow them and pass over."
Daniel,11,41,"He shall enter also the Pleasant Land, and many countries shall be overthrown. But these shall escape out of his hand, even Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the sons of Ammon."
Daniel,11,42,"Then he shall stretch out his hand against the countries, and the land of Egypt shall not escape."
