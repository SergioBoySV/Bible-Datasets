Amos,2,7,"They trample the head of the poor into the dust of the earth, and push the oppressed out of the way. A man and his father go in to the same woman, profaning My holy name."

Amos,3,6,"If the trumpet blasts in the city, are not the people frightened? If there is disaster against a city, is it not the Lord who has done it?"
Amos,3,7,Surely the Lord God does nothing without revealing His purpose to His servants the prophets.

Amos,5,12,"For I know your transgressions are many and your sins are grievous, you who oppress the just, who take a bribe and subvert the needy at the gate."
Amos,5,13,"Therefore the prudent are silent at such a time, for it is an evil time."
Amos,5,14,"Seek good and not evil, so that you may live; then the Lord , the God of Hosts, will truly be with you, as you claim."
Amos,5,15,"Hate evil and love good, and establish justice at the gate. It may then be that the Lord God of Hosts will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph."
Amos,5,16,"Therefore thus says the Lord , the God of Hosts, the Lord: Wailing will be in all the squares, and in all the streets they will say, “Alas! Alas!” They shall call the farmer to mourning, and to wailing those skilled in lamentation."
Amos,5,17,"In all vineyards there shall be wailing, for I will pass through you, says the Lord."
Amos,5,18,"Woe to you that desire the day of the Lord! Why do you want the day of the Lord? It is darkness, and not light,"

Amos,6,2,"Cross over to Kalneh and see, and go from there to Hamath the great; then go down to Gath of the Philistines— are you better than these kingdoms? Or is their territory greater than your territory?"
Amos,6,3,"You who brush off the day of disaster, but bring on a session of lawlessness;"
Amos,6,4,"who lie upon beds of ivory, and lounge on their couches, eating lambs from the flock and calves from the stall;"
Amos,6,5,who sing to the sound of the harp and invent musical instruments for themselves like David;
Amos,6,6,"who drink from bowls of wine and anoint themselves with the finest oils, but are not grieved over the destruction of Joseph."
Amos,6,7,"Therefore now they will go at the head of the captives into exile, and the revelry of those who are lounging will vanish."

Amos,6,11,"But indeed the Lord gives a command, and He will shatter the great house to bits, and the small house to pieces."
Amos,6,12,"Can horses run on a rocky crag? Can one plow the sea with oxen? But you have turned justice into poison, and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood,"
Amos,6,13,"you who rejoice in Lo Debar, who say, “Is it not by our own strength that we captured Karnaim?”"

Amos,7,2,"When they had finished devouring the foliage of the land, I said, “O Lord God , please forgive. How can Jacob survive? For he is small.”"
Amos,7,3,"The Lord relented concerning this: “It shall not be,” said the Lord."
Amos,7,4,This is what the Lord God showed me: The Lord God was calling for a judgment by fire. It was consuming the great deep and was devouring the fields.
Amos,7,5,"I said, “O Lord God , please stop. How can Jacob survive? For he is small.”"
Amos,7,6,"The Lord relented concerning this: “This also shall not be,” said the Lord God."
Amos,7,7,"This is what He showed me: The Lord was standing by a wall made using a plumb line, with a plumb line in His hand."

Amos,7,9,"The high places of Isaac will be destroyed, the sanctuaries of Israel will be laid waste, and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.”"
Amos,7,10,"Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent a message to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, “Amos has conspired against you at the very center of the house of Israel. The country cannot endure all his words."
Amos,7,11,"For this is what Amos said: ‘Jeroboam will die by the sword, and Israel will surely be exiled away from its land.’ ”"
Amos,7,12,"So Amaziah said to Amos, “O seer, go, flee back to the land of Judah. Earn your sustenance there, and prophesy there."
Amos,7,13,"But do not prophesy any more at Bethel, for it is the king’s sanctuary and a royal temple.”"
Amos,7,14,"But Amos answered Amaziah: “I am no prophet, and I am no prophet’s disciple. Rather, I am a herdsman and a dresser of sycamore trees."
Amos,7,15,"But the Lord took me away from the flock, and the Lord said to me, ‘Go, prophesy to My people Israel.’"
Amos,7,16,"Now therefore hear the word of the Lord : You say, ‘Do not prophesy against Israel, and do not preach against the house of Isaac.’"
Amos,7,17,"“Therefore thus says the Lord: ‘Your wife will be a prostitute in the city, your sons and daughters will fall by the sword, and your land will be divided by measuring line; you yourself will die in an unclean land; and Israel will surely go into exile away from its land.’ ”"
Amos,8,1,This is what the Lord God showed me: a basket of summer fruit.

Amos,8,3,"“The songs of the temple shall become wailings on that day,” says the Lord God . “The corpses shall be many, cast down everywhere. Hush!”"
Amos,8,4,"Hear this, you who trample on the needy to make the poor of the land fail,"
Amos,8,5,"saying, “When will the New Moon be over, so that we may sell grain? And the Sabbath, that we may open the wheat sales, making the ephah too small, and the shekel too heavy, cheating with dishonest scales,"
Amos,8,6,"that we may buy the poor for silver, the needy for a pair of sandals, and sell the refuse as wheat?”"
Amos,8,7,The Lord has sworn by the pride of Jacob: Surely I will never forget any of their deeds.

Amos,8,9,"On that day, says the Lord God, I will make the sun go down at noon, and darken the earth in mid-daylight;"
Amos,8,10,"I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into dirges; I will put sackcloth upon all loins, and baldness on every head; I will make it like the mourning for an only child, and its end like a bitter day."
Amos,8,11,"The time is coming, says the Lord God, when I will send a famine on the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord."
Amos,8,12,"They will wander from sea to sea, and from north to east; they will run back and forth to seek the word of the Lord, but they will not find it."

Amos,9,2,"Though they dig down to Sheol, from there My hand will capture them; though they climb up to the heavens, from there I will bring them down;"
Amos,9,3,"though they hide on the top of Carmel, from there I will search and catch them; though they hide from My sight on the bottom of the sea, from there will I command the serpent to bite them;"
Amos,9,4,"and though they go into captivity before their enemies, from there will I command the sword to slay them. I will set My eyes upon them for evil and not for good."

Amos,9,10,"All the sinners of My people will die by the sword, those who say, “Never will disaster reach or overtakeus.”"
Amos,9,11,"On that day will I raise up the hut of David that is fallen; I will close up its breached walls, raise up its ruins, and rebuild it as in the days of old;"
Amos,9,12,"that they may possess the remnant of Edom, and of all the nations called by My name, says the Lord who will do this."
Amos,9,13,"Indeed, the days are coming, says the Lord, when the plowman will overtake the one who is reaping, and the treader of grapes the one who is sowing the seed; the mountains will drip sweet wine, and all the hills will flow with it."
Amos,9,14,I will restore the fortunes of My people Israel; they will rebuild the ruined cities and inhabit them; they will plant vineyards and drink their wine; they will make gardens and eat their fruit.
Amos,9,15,"I will plant them upon their land, and no more will they be uprooted out of their land which I have given them. The Lord your God has spoken."
