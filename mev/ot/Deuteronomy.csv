Deuteronomy,1,1,"These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on the other side of the Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel and Laban and Hazeroth and Dizahab."
Deuteronomy,1,2,(It is an eleven-day journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh Barnea.)
Deuteronomy,1,3,"In the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, Moses spoke to the children of Israel, according to all that the Lord had commanded him to give to them."
Deuteronomy,1,4,"It was after he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who lived at Ashtaroth in Edrei."
Deuteronomy,1,5,"Across the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses began to declare this law, saying:"
Deuteronomy,1,6,"The Lord our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying, “You have dwelt long enough at this mountain."
Deuteronomy,1,7,"Turn, and take your journey, and go to the mountains of the Amorites, and to all their neighbors, in the plain, in the mountains and in the lowland, in the Negev and by the seacoast, to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon, as far as the great river, the River Euphrates."
Deuteronomy,1,8,"See, I have set the land before you. Go in and possess the land which the Lord swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give to them and to their descendants after them.”"
Deuteronomy,1,9,"I spoke to you at that time, saying, “I am not able to bear you by myself."
Deuteronomy,1,10,"The Lord your God has multiplied you, and surely you are this day as numerous as the stars of heaven."
Deuteronomy,1,11,"May the Lord , the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times more numerous and bless you, just as He has promised you!"
Deuteronomy,1,12,How can I myself bear your load and your burden and your strife?
Deuteronomy,1,13,"Choose wise, discerning, and knowing men, among your tribes, and I will appoint them as leaders over you.”"
Deuteronomy,1,14,"You answered me, and said, “The thing which you have said is good for us to do.”"
Deuteronomy,1,15,"So I took the leaders of your tribes, wise and well-known men, and appointed them as leaders over you, leaders over thousands, and leaders over hundreds, and leaders over fifties, and leaders over tens, and officers among your tribes."
Deuteronomy,1,16,"I charged your judges at that time, saying, “Hear the issues between your countrymen, and judge righteously between every man and his fellow countryman, and the foreigner that is with him."
Deuteronomy,1,17,"You shall not show partiality in judgment, but you shallhear the small as well as the great. You shall not be afraid in any man’s presence, for the judgment is God’s. The case that is too hard for you, you shall bring it to me, and I will hear it.”"
Deuteronomy,1,18,"At that time, I commanded you all the things you should do."
Deuteronomy,1,19,"When we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which you saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the Lord our God commanded us, and we came to Kadesh Barnea."
Deuteronomy,1,20,"I said to you, “You have come to the mountains of the Amorites, which the Lord our God is giving to us."
Deuteronomy,1,21,"See, the Lord your God has set the land before you. Go up and possess it, just as the Lord , the God of your fathers, spoke to you. Do not fear or be discouraged.”"
Deuteronomy,1,22,"So all of you came near to me and said, “Let us send men before us, so that they shall scout out the land, and bring back to us word concerning what way we should go up and into what cities we shall come.”"
Deuteronomy,1,23,"The thing pleased me, and I took twelve men from you, one out of each tribe."
Deuteronomy,1,24,They turned and went up into the hill country and came to the Valley of Eshkol and scouted it out.
Deuteronomy,1,25,"They took the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down to us, and brought us word again, and said, “It is a good land which the Lord our God is giving us.”"
Deuteronomy,1,26,"Yet you were not willing to go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the Lord your God."
Deuteronomy,1,27,"You murmured in your tents, and said, “Because the Lord hates us, He has brought us out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us."
Deuteronomy,1,28,"Where shall we go up? Our brothers have discouraged our hearts, saying, ‘The people are greater and taller than we. The cities are great and walled up to heaven. And moreover, we have seen the sons of the Anakites there.’ ”"
Deuteronomy,1,29,"Then I said to you, “Do not be terrified, or afraid of them."
Deuteronomy,1,30,"The Lord your God who goes before you, He shall fight for you, just as all that He did for you in Egypt before your eyes,"
Deuteronomy,1,31,"and in the wilderness, where you saw how the Lord your God carried you, as a man carries his son, in all the way that you went, until you came to this place.”"
Deuteronomy,1,32,"Yet in this thing you did not believe the Lord your God,"
Deuteronomy,1,33,"who went in the way before you, to find you a place to pitch your tents, in fire by night and in a cloud by day, to show you by what way you should go."
Deuteronomy,1,34,"The Lord heard the sound of your words, and was angry, and vowed, saying,"
Deuteronomy,1,35,“Not one of these men of this evil generation will see the good land which I swore to give to your fathers.
Deuteronomy,1,36,"The exception will be Caleb the son of Jephunneh. He shall see it, and to him I will give the land upon which he has walked, and to his children, because he has wholly followed the Lord .”"
Deuteronomy,1,37,"Also the Lord was angry with me on your account, saying, “You also shall not go in."
Deuteronomy,1,38,"But Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall go in. Encourage him, for he will cause Israel to inherit it."
Deuteronomy,1,39,"Moreover, your little ones, who you said would be a prey, and your children, who in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in, and to them will I give it, and they shall possess it."
Deuteronomy,1,40,"But as for you, turn around, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.”"
Deuteronomy,1,41,"Then you answered and said to me, “We have sinned against the Lord . We will go up and fight, just as the Lord our God commanded us.” So each of you girded on his weapons of war and you thought it easy to go up into the hill country."
Deuteronomy,1,42,"Then the Lord said to me, “Tell them, ‘Do not go up nor fight, for I am not among you; lest you be defeated before your enemies.’ ”"
Deuteronomy,1,43,"So I spoke to you, but you would not listen. Instead, you rebelled against the commandment of the Lord and went presumptuously up into the hill country."
Deuteronomy,1,44,"The Amorites, who lived in the hill country, came out against you, and chased you as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir as far as Hormah."
Deuteronomy,1,45,"Then you returned and wept before the Lord , but the Lord would neither listen to your voice nor give ear to you."
Deuteronomy,1,46,"So you dwelt in Kadesh many days, according to the days you dwelt there."
Deuteronomy,2,1,"Then we turned, and set out toward the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea, as the Lord spoke to me, and we circled Mount Seir for many days."
Deuteronomy,2,2,"Then the Lord spoke to me, saying,"
Deuteronomy,2,3,“You have circled this mountain long enough. Now turn north.
Deuteronomy,2,4,"Command the people, saying: You are to pass through the territory of your brothers the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir, and they shall be afraid of you. So carefully watch yourselves."
Deuteronomy,2,5,"Do not provoke them, for I will not give you any of their land, no, not so much as a footprint, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau for a possession."
Deuteronomy,2,6,"You may buy food from them with money so that you may eat, and you may also buy water from them with money so that you may drink."
Deuteronomy,2,7,“For the Lord your God has blessed you in all the works of your hands. He knows your wanderings through this great wilderness. These forty years the Lord your God has been with you. You have lacked nothing.”
Deuteronomy,2,8,"So we passed by our brothers, the children of Esau, who lived in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath and from Ezion Geber, and we turned and passed by the way of the Wilderness of Moab."
Deuteronomy,2,9,"The Lord said to me, “Do not harass the Moabites, nor contend with them in battle, for I will not give you any of their land for a possession, because I have given Ar to the children of Lot as a possession.”"
Deuteronomy,2,10,"(The Emites lived there in times past, a people as great and as many and as tall as the Anakites."
Deuteronomy,2,11,"These people, as well as the Anakites, also were regarded as giants, but the Moabites call them Emites."
Deuteronomy,2,12,"The Horites also formerly lived in Seir, but the children of Esau dispossessed and destroyed them, and settled there in their place, just as Israel did to the land of its possession, which the Lord gave to them.)"
Deuteronomy,2,13,“Cross over the Zered Valley.” So we went over the Zered Valley.
Deuteronomy,2,14,"Now the length of time it took for us to come to Kadesh Barnea until we crossed over the brook Zered was thirty-eight years, until all the generation of the men of war perished from among the army, just as the Lord swore to them."
Deuteronomy,2,15,"For indeed the hand of the Lord was against them, to destroy them from among their midst, until they were gone."
Deuteronomy,2,16,"So it came to pass, when all the men of war were gone and dead from among the people,"
Deuteronomy,2,17,"then the Lord spoke to me, saying,"
Deuteronomy,2,18,"“Today, you are to pass over through Ar, the border of Moab."
Deuteronomy,2,19,"When you come close to the Ammonites, do not harass them or provoke them, for I will not give you any of the land of the Ammonites as a possession, because I have given it to the children of Lot for a possession.”"
Deuteronomy,2,20,"(That also is considered the land of giants. Giants formerly lived there, but the Ammon­ites call them Zamzummites."
Deuteronomy,2,21,"They were a great people, as numerous and tall as the Anakites. But the Lord destroyed them before the Ammonites . Then they dispossessed them and lived in their place,"
Deuteronomy,2,22,"just as He had done for the children of Esau, who lived in Seir, when He destroyed the Horites from before them, and they dispossessed them, and lived in their place even to this day."
Deuteronomy,2,23,"And the Avvites, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorites, who came out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and lived in their place.)"
Deuteronomy,2,24,"“Arise, set out, and cross the River Arnon. See, I have given Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land into your hand. Begin to possess it and contend with him in battle."
Deuteronomy,2,25,"This day I will begin to put the dread of you and the fear of you on the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear the report of you, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of you.”"
Deuteronomy,2,26,"I sent messengers out of the Wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon, king of Heshbon, with words of peace, saying,"
Deuteronomy,2,27,“Let me pass through your land. I will only go on the main road. I will not turn aside to the right or the left.
Deuteronomy,2,28,"You shall sell me food for money so that I may eat, and give me water for money so that I may drink, only allow me to pass through on foot,"
Deuteronomy,2,29,"just as the children of Esau who dwell in Seir and the Moabites who dwell in Ar did for me, until I pass over the Jordan into the land which the Lord our God is giving us.”"
Deuteronomy,2,30,"But Sihon, king of Heshbon, would not let us pass by him, for the Lord your God hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate, so that He might deliver him into your hand as he is to this day."
Deuteronomy,2,31,"The Lord said to me, “See, I have begun to give Sihon and his land to you. Begin to possess it , so that you may inherit his land.”"
Deuteronomy,2,32,"Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz."
Deuteronomy,2,33,"Then the Lord our God delivered him over to us, and we struck him down with his sons and all his people."
Deuteronomy,2,34,"We took all his cities at that time and utterly destroyed the men, the women, and the children of every city. We left no survivors."
Deuteronomy,2,35,We took only the livestock for plunder and the spoils of the cities which we took.
Deuteronomy,2,36,"From Aroer, which is on the bank of the River Arnon, and from the city that is in the valley, all the way to Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us. The Lord our God delivered all to us."
Deuteronomy,2,37,"Only you did not come near the land of the Ammonites, nor to any place on the River Jabbok, nor to the cities in the hill country, nor to any place the Lord our God had forbidden us."
Deuteronomy,3,1,"Then we turned and went up the way to Bashan, and Og, the king of Bashan, came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei."
Deuteronomy,3,2,"Then the Lord said to me, “Do not fear him, for I will deliver him and all his people and his land into your hand; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon, king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.”"
Deuteronomy,3,3,"So the Lord , our God, delivered Og, the king of Bashan, with all his people, into our hands also, and we struck him down until there was no survivor remaining."
Deuteronomy,3,4,"We took all his cities at that time. There was not a city which we did not take from them: sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan."
Deuteronomy,3,5,"All these cities were fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, besides a great many rural towns."
Deuteronomy,3,6,"We utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon, king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children of every city."
Deuteronomy,3,7,But we took all the livestock and the spoil of the cities as plunder for ourselves.
Deuteronomy,3,8,"So at that time we took from the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was across the Jordan, from the River Arnon to Mount Hermon"
Deuteronomy,3,9,"(the Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir),"
Deuteronomy,3,10,"all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, as far as Salekah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan."
Deuteronomy,3,11,"For only Og, king of Bashan, remained of the remnant of the giants. (Notably, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron. Is it not in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? It is nine cubits long and four cubits wide, according to the cubit of a man.)"
Deuteronomy,3,12,"This is the land which we possessed at that time from Aroer, which is by the River Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead and its cities I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites."
Deuteronomy,3,13,"The rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh. (All the region of Argob, with all Bashan, was called the land of giants."
Deuteronomy,3,14,"Jair, the son of Manasseh, took all the region of Argob, that is, Bashan, as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maakathites, and called the villages after his own name, Havvoth Jair, as it is to this day.)"
Deuteronomy,3,15,I gave Gilead to Makir.
Deuteronomy,3,16,"To the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave the territory from Gilead even as far as the stream bed of the River Arnon, half the valley as the border to the River Jabbok, which is the border of the Ammonites;"
Deuteronomy,3,17,"the plain also, with the Jordan as the border, from Kinnereth as far as the east side of the Sea of the Arabah (that is, the Dead Sea), below the slopes of Pisgah."
Deuteronomy,3,18,"Then I commanded you at that time, saying, “The Lord your God has given you this land to possess it. All you men of valor shall pass over armed before your brothers, the children of Israel."
Deuteronomy,3,19,"But your wives and your little ones, and your livestock (for I know that you have much livestock) shall remain in your cities which I have given you"
Deuteronomy,3,20,"until the Lord has given rest to your brothers, as well as to you, and until they also possess the land which the Lord your God has given them beyond the Jordan. Then each of you shall return to his possession which I have given you.”"
Deuteronomy,3,21,"I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, “Your eyes have seen all that the Lord your God has done to these two kings. So shall the Lord do to all the kingdoms where you pass."
Deuteronomy,3,22,"Do not fear them, for the Lord your God, He shall fight for you.”"
Deuteronomy,3,23,"I pleaded with the Lord at that time, saying,"
Deuteronomy,3,24,"“O Lord God, You have begun to show Your servant Your greatness, and Your mighty hand, for what god is there in heaven or in earth that can do according to Your works and according to Your might?"
Deuteronomy,3,25,"Let me, I pray, go over and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, that good hill country, and Lebanon.”"
Deuteronomy,3,26,"But the Lord was angry with me because of you and would not listen to me, and the Lord said to me, “Enough of that! Speak to Me no more of this matter."
Deuteronomy,3,27,"Get up to the top of Pisgah and lift up your eyes to the west and north and south and east, and see it with your eyes, for you shall not cross over this Jordan."
Deuteronomy,3,28,"But charge Joshua and encourage him and strengthen him, for he shall cross over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you will see.”"
Deuteronomy,3,29,So we remained in the valley over against Beth Peor.
Deuteronomy,4,1,"Now therefore, listen, O Israel, to the statutes and to the judgments which I am teaching you to do, so that you may live; and go in and possess the land which the Lord , the God of your fathers, is giving you."
Deuteronomy,4,2,"You shall not add to the word which I am commanding you, nor shall you take anything from it, so that you may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you."
Deuteronomy,4,3,Your eyes have seen what the Lord did at Baal Peor; for the Lord your God has destroyed from among you all the men who followed Baal of Peor.
Deuteronomy,4,4,"But you who held fast to the Lord your God are alive to this day, every one of you."
Deuteronomy,4,5,"See, I have taught you statutes and judgments, just as the Lord my God commanded me, that you should do so in the land where you are entering to possess it."
Deuteronomy,4,6,"Therefore, keep and do them, for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations which shall hear all these statutes, and say, “Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.”"
Deuteronomy,4,7,"For what nation is there so great, who has a god so near to it as the Lord our God is in all things whenever we call on Him?"
Deuteronomy,4,8,"And what nation is there so great that has statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I am setting before you today?"
Deuteronomy,4,9,"Only give heed to yourself and keep your soul diligently, lest you forget the things which your eyes have seen and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life; but teach them to your sons, and your grandsons."
Deuteronomy,4,10,"Especially concerning the day you stood before the Lord your God at Horeb, when the Lord said to me, “Gather the people together to Me, so that I will let them hear My words so that they may learn to fear Me all the days they shall live on the earth, and so that they may teach their children.”"
Deuteronomy,4,11,"Then you came near and stood at the foot of the mountain, and the mountain burned with fire up to the midst of heaven, with darkness, a cloud, a thick cloud."
Deuteronomy,4,12,Then the Lord spoke to you out of the midst of the fire. You heard the sound of the words but saw no form—only a voice was heard.
Deuteronomy,4,13,"He declared to you His covenant, which He commanded you to perform, even the Ten Commandments, and He wrote them on two tablets of stone."
Deuteronomy,4,14,"The Lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, so that you might do them in the land which you are crossing over to possess."
Deuteronomy,4,15,"Give good care to yourselves, for you saw no form on the day that the Lord spoke to you in Horeb from the midst of the fire,"
Deuteronomy,4,16,"lest you corrupt yourselves and make a graven image for yourselves in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female,"
Deuteronomy,4,17,"the likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flies in the air,"
Deuteronomy,4,18,"the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth."
Deuteronomy,4,19,"And beware , lest you lift up your eyes to heaven, and when you see the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, you are led astray and worship them, and serve them, that which the Lord your God has allotted to all nations under the whole heaven."
Deuteronomy,4,20,"But the Lord has taken you and brought you out of the iron furnace, from Egypt, to be to Him a people of inheritance, as you are today."
Deuteronomy,4,21,"Furthermore, the Lord was angry with me because of you and swore that I should not cross over the Jordan, and that I would not go into that good land which the Lord your God is giving you for an inheritance."
Deuteronomy,4,22,"So I must die in this land. I shall not cross over the Jordan, but you shall go over and possess that good land."
Deuteronomy,4,23,"Watch yourselves, so that you do not forget the covenant of the Lord your God, which He made with you, and make yourself a graven image or the likeness of anything as the Lord your God has forbidden you."
Deuteronomy,4,24,For the Lord your God is a consuming fire. He is a jealous God.
Deuteronomy,4,25,"When you produce children and grandchildren and you have remained a long time in the land, and you corrupt yourselves and make a graven image, or the likeness of anything, and do evil in the sight of the Lord your God, to provoke Him to anger,"
Deuteronomy,4,26,"I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that you will surely and suddenly perish from off the land that you are going across the Jordan to possess. You will not prolong your days on it, but shall be completely destroyed."
Deuteronomy,4,27,"The Lord shall scatter you among the peoples, and you shall be left few in number among the nations where the Lord shall lead you."
Deuteronomy,4,28,"There you will serve gods, the work of men’s hands, wood and stone, which neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell."
Deuteronomy,4,29,"But if from there you will seek the Lord your God, you will find Him, if you seek Him with all your heart and with all your soul."
Deuteronomy,4,30,"When you are in distress and all these things come upon you, even in the latter days, if you turn to the Lord your God and shall be obedient to His voice"
Deuteronomy,4,31,"(for the Lord your God is a merciful God), He will not abandon you or destroy you or forget the covenant of your fathers which He swore to them."
Deuteronomy,4,32,"Indeed, ask about the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth, and ask from one end of heavens to the other, whether there has ever been any such thing as this great thing, or has anything like it ever been heard?"
Deuteronomy,4,33,"Has a people ever heard the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you have heard, and lived?"
Deuteronomy,4,34,"Or has God ever tried to take for Himself a nation from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched-out arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?"
Deuteronomy,4,35,"To you it was shown so that you might know that the Lord , He is God. There is no one else besides Him."
Deuteronomy,4,36,"Out of heaven He let you hear His voice so that He might instruct you, and on earth He showed you His great fire, and you heard His words out of the midst of the fire."
Deuteronomy,4,37,"Because He loved your fathers, therefore He chose their descendants after them and personally brought you out of Egypt with His mighty power"
Deuteronomy,4,38,"to drive out nations from before you greater and mightier than you are, to bring you in, to give you their land for an inheritance, as it is today."
Deuteronomy,4,39,"Know therefore today, and consider it in your heart, that the Lord , He is God in heaven above and on the earth below. There is no other."
Deuteronomy,4,40,"Therefore, you shall keep His statutes and His commandments which I command you this day, so that it may go well with you and with your children after you, and so that you may prolong your days in the land, which the Lord your God gives you, forever."
Deuteronomy,4,41,"Then Moses set apart three cities across the Jordan, toward the east,"
Deuteronomy,4,42,"that the manslayer might flee there, that is, anyone who killed his neighbor unintentionally without hating him in time past could flee to one of these cities and live:"
Deuteronomy,4,43,"Bezer in the wilderness in the plateau of the Reubenites, and Ramoth in Gilead of the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan of the Manassites."
Deuteronomy,4,44,This is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel.
Deuteronomy,4,45,"These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances which Moses spoke to the children of Israel, after they came out of Egypt,"
Deuteronomy,4,46,"on this side of the Jordan, in the valley over against Beth Peor, in the land of Sihon, king of the Amo­rites, who lived at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel struck down, after they had come out of Egypt."
Deuteronomy,4,47,"They possessed his land, and the land of Og, king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who were across the Jordan toward the east,"
Deuteronomy,4,48,"from Aroer, which is by the edge of the River Arnon, even as far as Mount Sion (that is, Hermon),"
Deuteronomy,4,49,"with all the Arabah across the Jordan to the east, even to the sea of the Arabah, under the slopes of Pisgah."
Deuteronomy,5,1,"Then Moses called all Israel and said to them: Hear, O Israel, the statutes and ordinances which I am speaking in your hearing today, so that you may learn them, and keep, and do them."
Deuteronomy,5,2,The Lord our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.
Deuteronomy,5,3,"The Lord did not make this covenant with our fathers, but with us, we who are living now and here today."
Deuteronomy,5,4,The Lord talked with you face to face on the mountain from the midst of the fire.
Deuteronomy,5,5,I stood between the Lord and you at that time to declare to you the word of the Lord ; for you were afraid because of the fire and would not go up to the mountain. He said:
Deuteronomy,5,6,"I am the Lord , your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage."
Deuteronomy,5,7,You shall have no other gods before Me.
Deuteronomy,5,8,"You shall not make yourself any graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the waters beneath the earth;"
Deuteronomy,5,9,"you shall not bow down to them, nor serve them. For I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, and on the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me,"
Deuteronomy,5,10,but showing mercy to thousands of them that love Me and keep My commandments.
Deuteronomy,5,11,"You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not exonerate anyone who takes His name in vain."
Deuteronomy,5,12,"Keep the Sabbath day, to keep it holy, just as the Lord your God has commanded you."
Deuteronomy,5,13,"Six days you shall labor and do all your work,"
Deuteronomy,5,14,"but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God . On it you shall not do any work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your livestock, nor the foreigner that is within your gates, so that your male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you."
Deuteronomy,5,15,"Remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the Lord your God brought you out from there with a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm; therefore your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day."
Deuteronomy,5,16,"Honor your father and your mother, just as the Lord your God has commanded you, that your days may be prolonged, and that it may go well with you in the land which the Lord your God is giving you."
Deuteronomy,5,17,You shall not murder.
Deuteronomy,5,18,You shall not commit adultery.
Deuteronomy,5,19,You shall not steal.
Deuteronomy,5,20,You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
Deuteronomy,5,21,"You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, nor shall you covet your neighbor’s house, his field, his male servant, his female servant, his ox, his donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor."
Deuteronomy,5,22,"These are the words the Lord spoke to all your assembly at the mountain out from the midst of the fire, the cloud, and the thick darkness with a great voice, and He added no more. He wrote them on two tablets of stone and gave them to me."
Deuteronomy,5,23,"When you heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, while the mountain did burn with fire, you came near to me, all the heads of your tribes, and your elders."
Deuteronomy,5,24,"You said, “See, the Lord our God has shown us His glory and His greatness, and we have heard His voice from the midst of the fire. We have seen this day that God speaks with man, yet he lives."
Deuteronomy,5,25,"Now, therefore, why should we die? For this great fire will consume us. If we hear the voice of the Lord our God any more, then we will die."
Deuteronomy,5,26,"For who is there of all flesh who has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?"
Deuteronomy,5,27,"Go near and hear all that the Lord our God will say. Then speak to us all that the Lord our God will speak to you, and we will hear and do it.”"
Deuteronomy,5,28,"The Lord heard the sound of your words when you spoke to me, and the Lord said to me, “I have heard the sound of the words of this people which they have spoken to you. They have done well in all that they have spoken."
Deuteronomy,5,29,"O that there were such a heart in them that they would fear Me and always keep all My commandments, that it might be well with them and with their children forever!"
Deuteronomy,5,30,"“Go say to them, ‘Return to your tents.’"
Deuteronomy,5,31,"But as for you, stand here by Me, so that I may speak to you all the commandments, and the statutes, and the ordinances which you shall teach them, that they may keep them in the land which I am giving them to possess.”"
Deuteronomy,5,32,"Therefore, be careful to do as the Lord your God has commanded you. You shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left."
Deuteronomy,5,33,"You shall walk in all the ways which the Lord your God has commanded you, so that you may live and that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days in the land which you shall possess."
Deuteronomy,6,1,"Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the ordinances which the Lord your God commanded to teach you, so that you may observe them in the land which you are crossing over to possess,"
Deuteronomy,6,2,"so that you might fear the Lord your God in order to keep all His statutes and His commandments which I command you—you, and your son, and your grandson—all the days of your life, so that your days may be prolonged."
Deuteronomy,6,3,"Hear therefore, O Israel, and be careful to do it, so that it may be well with you and so that you may multiply greatly, as the Lord the God of your fathers has promised you in the land that flows with milk and honey."
Deuteronomy,6,4,"Hear, O Israel: The Lord is our God. The Lord is one!"
Deuteronomy,6,5,And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might.
Deuteronomy,6,6,"These words, which I am commanding you today, shall be in your heart."
Deuteronomy,6,7,"You shall teach them diligently to your children and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up."
Deuteronomy,6,8,"You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes."
Deuteronomy,6,9,You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.
Deuteronomy,6,10,"Then it shall be when the Lord your God brings you into the land which He swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give you great and fine cities, which you did not build,"
Deuteronomy,6,11,"and houses full of all good things which you did not fill, and hewn cisterns which you did not dig, vineyards and olive trees which you did not plant, and you eat and are full,"
Deuteronomy,6,12,"then beware lest you forget the Lord who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage."
Deuteronomy,6,13,You shall fear the Lord your God and serve Him and shall swear by His name.
Deuteronomy,6,14,"You shall not go after other gods, the gods of the people which surround you"
Deuteronomy,6,15,(for the Lord your God is a jealous God among you). Otherwise the anger of the Lord your God will be inflamed against you and destroy you from off the face of the earth.
Deuteronomy,6,16,"You shall not tempt the Lord your God, as you tempted Him in Massah."
Deuteronomy,6,17,"You shall diligently keep the commandments of the Lord your God, and His testimonies and His statutes which He has commanded you."
Deuteronomy,6,18,"You shall do what is right and good in the sight of the Lord that it may be well with you and that you may go in and possess the good land which the Lord swore to your fathers,"
Deuteronomy,6,19,"to drive out all your enemies before you, just as the Lord has spoken."
Deuteronomy,6,20,"When your son asks you in time to come, saying, “What do the testimonies and the statutes and the judgments mean which the Lord our God has commanded you?”"
Deuteronomy,6,21,"then you shall say to your son, “We were slaves of Pharaoh in Egypt, and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand."
Deuteronomy,6,22,"And the Lord showed great and devastating signs and wonders upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household before our eyes."
Deuteronomy,6,23,"He brought us out from there, so that He might bring us in, to give us the land which He swore to our fathers."
Deuteronomy,6,24,"The Lord commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the Lord our God, for our good always, that He might preserve us, as He has to this day."
Deuteronomy,6,25,"It will be our righteousness if we are careful to keep all these commandments before the Lord our God, just as He has commanded us.”"
Deuteronomy,7,1,"When the Lord your God brings you into the land which you are entering to possess and has driven out many nations before you, the Hittites and the Girgashites and the Amorites and the Canaanites and the Periz­zites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than you,"
Deuteronomy,7,2,"and when the Lord your God delivers them before you and you strike them down, then you must utterly destroy them. You shall make no covenant with them nor show mercy to them."
Deuteronomy,7,3,"What is more, you shall not intermarry with them. You shall not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons."
Deuteronomy,7,4,"For they will turn your sons away from following Me to serve other gods. Then the anger of the Lord will be inflamed against you, and He will quickly destroy you."
Deuteronomy,7,5,But this is how you shall deal with them: You shall destroy their altars and break down their images and cut down their Asherim and burn their graven images with fire.
Deuteronomy,7,6,"For you are a holy people to the Lord your God. The Lord your God has chosen you to be His special people, treasured above all peoples who are on the face of the earth."
Deuteronomy,7,7,"The Lord did not set His love on you nor choose you because you were more in number than any of the peoples, for you were the fewest of all the peoples."
Deuteronomy,7,8,"But it is because the Lord loved you and because He kept the oath which He swore to your fathers. The Lord brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh, king of Egypt."
Deuteronomy,7,9,"Know therefore that the Lord your God, He is God, the faithful God, who keeps ­covenant and mercy with them who love Him and keep His commandments to a thousand generations,"
Deuteronomy,7,10,"yet He repays those who hate Him to their face, to destroy them. He will not be slack with him who hates Him. He will repay him to his face."
Deuteronomy,7,11,"Therefore keep the commandments and the statutes and the judgments which I command you today, by doing them."
Deuteronomy,7,12,"If you listen to these judgments, keep them, and do them, then the Lord your God shall keep with you the covenant and the mercy which He swore to your fathers."
Deuteronomy,7,13,"He will love you and bless you and multiply you. He will also bless the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your land, your grain, and your wine, and your oil, the increase of your herd and the young of your flock, in the land which He swore to your fathers to give you."
Deuteronomy,7,14,You shall be blessed above all peoples. There will not be male or female barren among you or among your livestock.
Deuteronomy,7,15,"The Lord will take away from you all sickness, and will afflict you with none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which you know, but will lay them on all those who hate you."
Deuteronomy,7,16,"You must consume all the peoples whom the Lord your God will deliver to you. Your eye shall have no pity on them, nor shall you serve their gods, for that will be a snare to you."
Deuteronomy,7,17,"If you say in your heart, “These nations are greater than I—how can I dispossess them?”"
Deuteronomy,7,18,"you shall not be afraid of them. You must surely remember what the Lord your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt,"
Deuteronomy,7,19,"the great trials which your eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched-out arm, by which the Lord your God brought you out. So the Lord your God will do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid."
Deuteronomy,7,20,"Moreover the Lord your God will send the hornet among them, until they who are left and hide themselves from you perish."
Deuteronomy,7,21,"You must not be frightened of them, for the Lord your God is among you, a great and awesome God."
Deuteronomy,7,22,"The Lord your God will drive out those nations before you, little by little. You will not be able to destroy them all at once, lest the beasts of the field become too numerous for you."
Deuteronomy,7,23,But the Lord your God will deliver them to you and will throw them into a great confusion until they are destroyed.
Deuteronomy,7,24,He will deliver their kings into your hand so that you may erase their names from under heaven. No man will be able to stand before you until you have destroyed them.
Deuteronomy,7,25,"You must burn the graven images of their gods with fire. You must not desire the silver or gold that is on them nor take any of it, lest you be snared by them, for it is an abomination to the Lord your God."
Deuteronomy,7,26,"You shall not bring an abomination into your house, lest you become cursed like it, but you must absolutely detest and abhor it, for it is a cursed thing."
Deuteronomy,8,1,"You must carefully keep all the commandments that I am commanding you today, so that you may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the Lord swore to your fathers."
Deuteronomy,8,2,"You must remember that the Lord your God led you all the way these forty years in the wilderness, to humble you, and to prove you, to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep His commandments or not."
Deuteronomy,8,3,"He humbled you and let you suffer hunger, and fed you with manna, which you did not know, nor did your fathers know, that He might make you know that man does not live by bread alone; but man lives by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of the Lord."
Deuteronomy,8,4,"Your clothing did not wear out on you, nor did your feet swell these forty years."
Deuteronomy,8,5,"You must also consider in your heart that, as a man disciplines his son, so the Lord your God disciplines you."
Deuteronomy,8,6,"Therefore you must keep the commandments of the Lord your God, to walk in His ways and to fear Him."
Deuteronomy,8,7,"For the Lord your God is bringing you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and springs that flow out of valleys and hills,"
Deuteronomy,8,8,"a land of wheat, barley, vines, fig trees, and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey,"
Deuteronomy,8,9,"a land where you may eat bread without scarcity, in which you will not lack anything, a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you may dig copper."
Deuteronomy,8,10,"When you have eaten and are full, then you shall bless the Lord your God for the good land which He has given you."
Deuteronomy,8,11,"Beware that you do not forget the Lord your God by not keeping His commandments, and His judgments, and His statutes, which I am commanding you today."
Deuteronomy,8,12,"Otherwise, when you have eaten and are full and have built and occupied good houses,"
Deuteronomy,8,13,"and when your herds and your flocks multiply, and your silver and your gold multiply, and all that you have multiplies,"
Deuteronomy,8,14,"then your heart will become proud and you will forget the Lord your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of slavery,"
Deuteronomy,8,15,"who led you through that great and terrible wilderness, where there were fiery serpents and scorpions and drought, where there was no water, who brought forth for you water out of the rock of flint,"
Deuteronomy,8,16,"who fed you in the wilderness with manna, which your fathers did not know, that He might humble you and that He might prove you, to do good for you in the end."
Deuteronomy,8,17,"Otherwise, you may say in your heart, “My power and the might of my hand have gained me this wealth.”"
Deuteronomy,8,18,"But you must remember the Lord your God, for it is He who gives you the ability to get wealth, so that He may establish His covenant which He swore to your fathers, as it is today."
Deuteronomy,8,19,"If you ever forget the Lord your God and go after other gods and serve them and worship them, then I testify against you today that you will surely perish."
Deuteronomy,8,20,"Just like the nations which the Lord will destroy before you, so shall you perish because you would not be obedient to the voice of the Lord your God."
Deuteronomy,9,1,"Hear, O Israel! You are to cross over the Jordan today, to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than you, great cities fortified up to heaven,"
Deuteronomy,9,2,"a great and tall people, the children of the Anakites, whom you know and of whom you have heard it said, “Who can stand before the children of Anak?”"
Deuteronomy,9,3,"Understand therefore today that the Lord your God is He who goes over before you as a consuming fire. He shall destroy them and shall bring them down before you, so that you drive them out and destroy them quickly, as the Lord has spoken to you."
Deuteronomy,9,4,"Do not say in your heart, after the Lord your God has driven them out before you, “On account of my righteousness the Lord has brought me in to possess this land,” but it is because of the wickedness of these nations the Lord is driving them out before you."
Deuteronomy,9,5,"It is not because of your righteousness or the uprightness of your heart that you enter to possess their land, but because of the wickedness of these nations that the Lord your God drives them out before you, and that He may fulfill the word which the Lord swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."
Deuteronomy,9,6,"Understand, therefore, that the Lord your God is not giving you this good land to possess on account of your righteousness, for you are a stubborn people."
Deuteronomy,9,7,"Remember, and do not forget how you provoked the Lord your God to wrath in the wilderness. From the day that you departed out of the land of Egypt until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against the Lord."
Deuteronomy,9,8,"Also in Horeb you provoked the Lord to wrath, so that the Lord was angry enough with you to destroy you."
Deuteronomy,9,9,"When I went up into the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant which the Lord made with you, then I remained on the mountain forty days and forty nights. I did not eat bread or drink water."
Deuteronomy,9,10,"The Lord delivered to me two tablets of stone, written with the finger of God, and on them was written all the words which the Lord spoke to you at the mountain out of the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly."
Deuteronomy,9,11,"At the end of forty days and forty nights, the Lord gave me the two tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant."
Deuteronomy,9,12,"Then the Lord said to me, “Arise, go down from here quickly, for your people whom you brought out of Egypt have corrupted themselves. They are quickly turned aside from the way which I commanded them. They have made a molded image for themselves.”"
Deuteronomy,9,13,"Furthermore the Lord spoke to me, saying, “I have seen this people, and indeed, they are a stubborn people."
Deuteronomy,9,14,"Let Me alone, so that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven, and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.”"
Deuteronomy,9,15,"So I returned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire, and the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands."
Deuteronomy,9,16,"I looked, and indeed, you had sinned against the Lord your God and had made yourselves a molded calf. You had quickly turned aside out of the way which the Lord had commanded you."
Deuteronomy,9,17,I took the two tablets and threw them out of my two hands and broke them before your eyes.
Deuteronomy,9,18,"I fell down before the Lord , as at the first, forty days and forty nights. I did not eat bread or drink water because of all your sins which you committed, doing what was wicked in the sight of the Lord to provoke Him to anger."
Deuteronomy,9,19,For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure with which the Lord was wrathful against you to destroy you. But the Lord listened to me at that time also.
Deuteronomy,9,20,"The Lord was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him, so I also prayed for Aaron at the same time."
Deuteronomy,9,21,"I took your sin, the calf which you had made, and burned it with fire, and crushed it, and ground it very small until it was as small as dust. Then I threw the dust into the brook that descended down from the mountain."
Deuteronomy,9,22,Also at Taberah and at Massah and at Kibroth Hattaavah you provoked the Lord to wrath.
Deuteronomy,9,23,"Likewise when the Lord sent you from Kadesh Barnea, saying, “Go up and possess the land which I have given you,” then you rebelled against the commandment of the Lord your God, and you did not believe Him or listen to His voice."
Deuteronomy,9,24,You have been rebellious against the Lord from the day I knew you.
Deuteronomy,9,25,So I fell down before the Lord forty days and forty nights; I fell down because the Lord had said He would destroy you.
Deuteronomy,9,26,"I prayed therefore to the Lord , and said, “O Lord G od , do not destroy Your people, Your inheritance, which You have redeemed through Your greatness, which You have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand."
Deuteronomy,9,27,"Remember Your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Do not look at the stubbornness of this people or at their wickedness or their sin."
Deuteronomy,9,28,"Otherwise, the land from which You brought us may say, ‘Because the Lord was not able to bring them into the land which He promised them and because He hated them, He has brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.’"
Deuteronomy,9,29,"Yet they are Your people, Your inheritance, whom You brought out by Your mighty power and by Your stretched-out arm.”"
Deuteronomy,10,1,"At that time the Lord said to me, “Cut out for yourself two tablets of stone like the first and come up to Me onto the mountain and make an ark of wood for yourself."
Deuteronomy,10,2,"I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets which you broke, and you shall put them in the ark.”"
Deuteronomy,10,3,So I made an ark of acacia wood and cut out two tablets of stone just like the first and went up onto the mountain with the two tablets in my hand.
Deuteronomy,10,4,"He wrote on the tablets just like the first writing, the Ten Commandments which the Lord spoke to you at the mountain out of the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly, and the Lord gave them to me."
Deuteronomy,10,5,"I turned around and came down from the mountain and put the tablets in the ark which I had made, and there they are, just as the Lord commanded me."
Deuteronomy,10,6,"(The children of Israel set out from Beeroth of the sons of Jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died and was buried, and his son Eleazar ministered in the priest’s office in his place."
Deuteronomy,10,7,"From there they journeyed to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of rivers of waters."
Deuteronomy,10,8,"At that time the Lord set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the Lord , to stand before the Lord to minister to Him, and to bless in His name, to this day."
Deuteronomy,10,9,"Therefore, Levi has no portion or inheritance with his brothers. The Lord is his inheritance, just as the Lord your God promised him.)"
Deuteronomy,10,10,"As for me, I stayed on the mountain like the first time, forty days and forty nights, and the Lord listened to me at that time also. The Lord was not willing to destroy you."
Deuteronomy,10,11,"The Lord said to me, “Arise, take your journey before the people, so that they may go in and possess the land which I swore to give to their fathers.”"
Deuteronomy,10,12,"Now, Israel, what does the Lord your God require of you, but to fear the Lord your God, to walk in all His ways, and to love Him, and to serve the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul,"
Deuteronomy,10,13,to keep the commandments of the Lord and His statutes which I am commanding you today for your good?
Deuteronomy,10,14,"Indeed, heaven and the highest heavens belong to the Lord your God, also the earth with all that is in it."
Deuteronomy,10,15,"The Lord delighted only in your fathers, to love them; and He chose their descendants after them, even you above all people, as it is today."
Deuteronomy,10,16,"Therefore, circumcise your heart, and do not be stubborn anymore."
Deuteronomy,10,17,"For the Lord your God is the God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, the mighty, and the fearsome God who is unbiased and takes no bribe."
Deuteronomy,10,18,"He executes the judgment of the orphan and the widow and loves the foreigner, giving him food and clothing."
Deuteronomy,10,19,"Therefore, love the foreigner, for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt."
Deuteronomy,10,20,"You must fear the Lord your God. You must serve Him and cling to Him, and swear by His name."
Deuteronomy,10,21,"He is your praise, and He is your God, who has done for you these great and fearsome things which your eyes have seen."
Deuteronomy,10,22,"Your fathers went down into Egypt with seventy people, and now the Lord your God has made you as numerous as the stars of heaven."
Deuteronomy,11,1,"You must love the Lord your God and keep His charge, His statutes, His ordinances, and His commandments always."
Deuteronomy,11,2,"Know this day that I am not speaking with your children who have not known and who have not seen the discipline of the Lord your God, His greatness, His mighty hand, and His outstretched arm,"
Deuteronomy,11,3,"and His signs and His works which He did in the midst of Egypt to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and to all his land,"
Deuteronomy,11,4,"and what He did to the army of Egypt, to their horses, and to their chariots, when He made the water of the Red Sea to flow over them as they pursued after you, and how the Lord utterly destroyed them,"
Deuteronomy,11,5,"and what He did to you in the wilderness until you came to this place,"
Deuteronomy,11,6,"and what He did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben, when the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, their households, their tents, and everything that was in their possession, in the midst of all Israel."
Deuteronomy,11,7,But your eyes have seen all the great deeds of the Lord which He did.
Deuteronomy,11,8,"Therefore you must keep all the commandments which I am commanding you today, so that you may be strong and go in and possess the land which you are going to possess;"
Deuteronomy,11,9,"and that you may prolong your days in the land which the Lord swore to your fathers to give to them and to their descendants, a land flowing with milk and honey."
Deuteronomy,11,10,"For the land which you are entering to possess is not like the land of Egypt from where you came, where you sowed your seed and watered it with your foot like a vegetable garden,"
Deuteronomy,11,11,"but the land, which you are entering to possess, is a land of hills and valleys and drinks water from the rain of heaven,"
Deuteronomy,11,12,"a land for which the Lord your God cares. The eyes of the Lord your God are always on it, from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year."
Deuteronomy,11,13,"It will be, if you will diligently obey My commandments which I am commanding you today, to love the Lord your God, and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul,"
Deuteronomy,11,14,"then I will give you the rain of your land in its season, the early rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your grain and your wine and your oil."
Deuteronomy,11,15,"I will provide grass in your fields for your livestock, that you may eat and be full."
Deuteronomy,11,16,"Take heed to yourselves that your heart be not deceived, and you turn away and serve other gods and worship them."
Deuteronomy,11,17,"Then the Lord ’s wrath will be inflamed against you, and He will shut up the heavens so that there will be no rain and the land will not yield its fruit, and you will quickly perish from the good land which the Lord is giving you."
Deuteronomy,11,18,"Therefore you must fix these words of mine in your heart and in your soul, and bind them as a sign on your hand, so that they may be as frontlets between your eyes."
Deuteronomy,11,19,"You shall teach them to your children, speaking of them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up."
Deuteronomy,11,20,"You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates,"
Deuteronomy,11,21,"so that your days and the days of your children may be multiplied in the land which the Lord swore to your fathers to give them, as long as the days of heaven on the earth."
Deuteronomy,11,22,"For if you diligently keep all these commandments which I am commanding you to do—to love the Lord your God, to walk in all His ways, and to hold fast to Him—"
Deuteronomy,11,23,"then the Lord will drive out all these nations from before you, and you will dispossess nations greater and mightier than you."
Deuteronomy,11,24,"Every place where the soles of your feet tread will be yours. Your border will be from the wilderness to Lebanon, from the river, the River Euphrates, as far as the Mediterranean Sea."
Deuteronomy,11,25,"No man will be able to resist you, for the Lord your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you on all the land where you shall tread, just as He has spoken to you."
Deuteronomy,11,26,"See, I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse:"
Deuteronomy,11,27,"the blessing if you obey the commandments of the Lord your God, which I am commanding you today,"
Deuteronomy,11,28,"and the curse, if you will not obey the commandments of the Lord your God, but turn from the way which I am commanding you today, to go after other gods which you have not known."
Deuteronomy,11,29,"Now it shall be, when the Lord your God has brought you into the land which you are entering to possess, that you shall put the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal."
Deuteronomy,11,30,"Are they not on the other side of the Jordan, west where the sun goes down, in the land of the Canaanites, who dwell in the plain opposite Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh?"
Deuteronomy,11,31,"For you will cross over the Jordan to go in to possess the land which the Lord your God is giving you, and you will possess it, and dwell in it."
Deuteronomy,11,32,You must be careful to do all the statutes and judgments which I am setting before you today.
Deuteronomy,12,1,"These are the statutes and judgments which you shall be careful to observe in the land, which the Lord , the God of your fathers, has given you to possess, all the days that you live on the earth."
Deuteronomy,12,2,"You must utterly destroy all the places where the nations which you will possess served their gods, on the high mountains, and on the hills, and under every green tree."
Deuteronomy,12,3,"And you shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their Asherah poles with fire, and you shall cut down the engraved images of their gods, and eliminate their names out of that place."
Deuteronomy,12,4,You shall not act this way toward the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy,12,5,"But you must seek only the place which the Lord your God shall choose out of all your tribes to establish His name, and there you must go."
Deuteronomy,12,6,"There you shall bring your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the offerings of your hand, your vows, your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herds and of your flocks."
Deuteronomy,12,7,"There you must eat before the Lord your God, and you shall rejoice in all that you put your hand to, you and your households, where the Lord your God has blessed you."
Deuteronomy,12,8,"You are not to do all the things that we are doing here today, where every man does whatever is right in his own eyes."
Deuteronomy,12,9,For you have not yet come to the rest and to the inheritance which the Lord your God has given you.
Deuteronomy,12,10,"But when you cross the Jordan, and dwell in the land which the Lord your God has given you to inherit, and when He gives you rest from all your enemies round about, so that you dwell in safety,"
Deuteronomy,12,11,"then there will be a place which the Lord your God will choose to cause His name to dwell. There you must bring all that I command you: your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, the offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which you vow to the Lord."
Deuteronomy,12,12,"You will rejoice before the Lord your God, you, your sons, your daughters, your male servants, your female servants, and the Levite who is within your gates, for he has no portion or inheritance with you."
Deuteronomy,12,13,Be careful that you do not offer your burnt offerings in every place that you see.
Deuteronomy,12,14,"Rather, in the place which the Lord will choose in one of your tribes, there you must offer your burnt offerings, and there you must do all that I command you."
Deuteronomy,12,15,"Notwithstanding, you may kill and eat meat within all your gates, whatever your heart desires, according to the blessing of the Lord your God which He has given you. The unclean and the clean may eat of it, of the gazelle and of the deer,"
Deuteronomy,12,16,only you must not eat the blood. You shall pour it on the ground like water.
Deuteronomy,12,17,"You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain, your wine, your oil, the firstborn of your herds or of your flock, any of your vows which you vow, your freewill offerings, or the offering of your hand."
Deuteronomy,12,18,"Rather you must eat them before the Lord your God in the place which the Lord your God will choose—you, your son, your daughter, your male servant, your female servant, and the Levite that is within your gates—and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God in all that you undertake to do."
Deuteronomy,12,19,Take heed to yourself that you do not forsake the Levite as long as you live on the earth.
Deuteronomy,12,20,"When the Lord your God shall enlarge your border as He has promised you, and you say, “I will eat meat,” because you desire to eat meat, then you may eat as much meat as your heart desires."
Deuteronomy,12,21,"If the place which the Lord your God has chosen to put His name is too far from you, then you shall kill of your herd and of your flock, which the Lord has given you, as I have commanded you, and you must eat in your gates whatever your heart desires."
Deuteronomy,12,22,"Even as the gazelle and the deer are eaten, so you shall eat them. The unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike."
Deuteronomy,12,23,"Only be sure that you do not eat the blood. For the blood is the life, and you may not eat the life with the meat."
Deuteronomy,12,24,You must not eat it. You must pour it on the ground like water.
Deuteronomy,12,25,"You must not eat it, so that it may go well with you and with your children after you, when you do that which is right in the sight of the Lord."
Deuteronomy,12,26,"You shall take only your holy things which you have, along with your vows, and go to the place which the Lord shall choose."
Deuteronomy,12,27,"You must offer your burnt offerings, the meat and the blood, on the altar of the Lord your God, and the blood of your sacrifices will be poured out on the altar of the Lord your God, and you shall eat the meat."
Deuteronomy,12,28,"Observe and hear all these words which I command you, so that it may go well with you and with your children after you forever, when you do that which is good and right in the sight of the Lord your God."
Deuteronomy,12,29,"When the Lord your God shall cut off the nations from before you, where you go to possess them, and you dispossess them, and dwell in their land,"
Deuteronomy,12,30,"take heed to yourself so that you are not ensnared by following them, after they have been destroyed before you, and that you not inquire after their gods, saying, “How did these nations serve their gods? Even so I will do likewise.”"

Deuteronomy,19,17,"then both the men between whom the controversy is must stand before the Lord , before the priests and the judges, who are in office those days."
Deuteronomy,19,18,"The judges will thoroughly investigate, and if the witness is a false witness and has testified falsely against his brother,"
Deuteronomy,19,19,then you must do to him as he conspired to have done to his brother. In this way you must remove the evil from among you.

Deuteronomy,20,16,"But of the cities of these people, which the Lord your God is giving you for an inheritance, you must not leave alive anything that breathes."
Deuteronomy,20,17,"But you shall completely destroy them: namely, the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hi­vites, and the Jebusites, just as the Lord your God has commanded you,"
Deuteronomy,20,18,"so that they do not teach you to participate in all their abominations, which they have done to their gods, causing you to sin against the Lord your God."
Deuteronomy,20,19,"When you lay siege to a city for a long time, in making war against it in order to take it, you shall not destroy the trees there by chopping them down with an axe, for you may eat from them, and you shall not cut them down. For the tree of the field is not a man in which to lay siege."

Deuteronomy,21,3,"And it must be, that the city which is closest to the slain man, that is, the elders of that city shall take a heifer which has not been worked, that has never pulled in yoke,"
Deuteronomy,21,4,"and the elders of that city must bring down the heifer to a valley with flowing water, which is neither plowed nor sown, and shall break the heifer’s neck there in the valley."
Deuteronomy,21,5,"Then the priests, the sons of Levi, must come near, for the Lord your God has chosen them to minister to Him, and to bless in the name of the Lord , and by their word every controversy and every assault will be settled."
Deuteronomy,21,6,"And all the elders of that city, which is nearest to the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley."
Deuteronomy,21,7,"Then they must answer and say, “Our hands have not shed this blood, and our eyes have not seen it."
