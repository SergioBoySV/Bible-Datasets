1 Chronicles,17,3,But that same night God said to Nathan
1 Chronicles,17,4,"“Go and tell my servant David, ‘This is what the LORD has declared: You are not the one to build a house for me to live in."
1 Chronicles,17,5,"I have never lived in a house, from the day I brought the Israelites out of Egypt until this very day. My home has always been a tent, moving from one place to another in a Tabernacle."
1 Chronicles,17,6,"Yet no matter where I have gone with the Israelites, I have never once complained to Israel’s leaders, the shepherds of my people. I have never asked them, “Why haven’t you built me a beautiful cedar house?”’"

“‘Furthermore, I declare that the LORD will build a house for you—a dynasty of kings!"
1 Chronicles,17,11,"For when you die and join your ancestors, I will raise up one of your descendants, one of your sons, and I will make his kingdom strong."
1 Chronicles,17,12,He is the one who will build a house—a temple—for me. And I will secure his throne forever.

1 Chronicles,17,14,"I will confirm him as king over my house and my kingdom for all time, and his throne will be secure forever.’”"

1 Chronicles,17,16,"Then King David went in and sat before the LORD and prayed,
“Who am I, O LORD God, and what is my family, that you have brought me this far?"

1 Chronicles,17,23,"“And now, O LORD, I am your servant; do as you have promised concerning me and my family. May it be a promise that will last forever."
1 Chronicles,17,24,"And may your name be established and honored forever so that everyone will say, ‘The LORD of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, is Israel’s God!’ And may the house of your servant David continue before you forever."
1 Chronicles,17,25,"“O my God, I have been bold enough to pray to you because you have revealed to your servant that you will build a house for him—a dynasty of kings!"
1 Chronicles,17,26,"For you are God, O LORD. And you have promised these good things to your servant."

1 Chronicles,18,4,"David captured 1,000 chariots, 7,000 charioteers, and 20,000 foot soldiers. He crippled all the chariot horses except enough for 100 chariots."
1 Chronicles,18,5,"When Arameans from Damascus arrived to help King Hadadezer, David killed 22,000 of them."
1 Chronicles,18,6,"Then he placed several army garrisons in Damascus, the Aramean capital, and the Arameans became David’s subjects and paid him tribute money. So the LORD made David victorious wherever he went."
1 Chronicles,18,7,David brought the gold shields of Hadadezer’s officers to Jerusalem
1 Chronicles,18,8,"along with a large amount of bronze from Hadadezer’s towns of Tebah and Cun. Later Solomon melted the bronze and molded it into the great bronze basin called the Sea, the pillars, and the various bronze articles used at the Temple."
1 Chronicles,18,9,When King Toi of Hamath heard that David had destroyed the entire army of King Hadadezer of Zobah
1 Chronicles,18,10,"he sent his son Joram to congratulate King David for his successful campaign. Hadadezer and Toi had been enemies and were often at war. Joram presented David with many gifts of gold, silver, and bronze."

1 Chronicles,18,12,"Abishai son of Zeruiah destroyed 18,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt."
1 Chronicles,18,13,"He placed army garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became David’s subjects. In fact, the LORD made David victorious wherever he went."
1 Chronicles,18,14,So David reigned over all Israel and did what was just and right for all his people.
1 Chronicles,18,15,Joab son of Zeruiah was commander of the army. Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was the royal historian.
1 Chronicles,18,16,Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech son of Abiathar were the priests. Seraiah was the court secretary.
1 Chronicles,18,17,Benaiah son of Jehoiada was captain of the king’s bodyguard. And David’s sons served as the king’s chief assistants.
1 Chronicles,19,1,"Some time after this, King Nahash of the Ammonites died, and his son Hanun became king."
1 Chronicles,19,2,"David said, “I am going to show loyalty to Hanun because his father, Nahash, was always loyal to me.” So David sent messengers to express sympathy to Hanun about his father’s death.
But when David’s ambassadors arrived in the land of Ammon"
1 Chronicles,19,3,"the Ammonite commanders said to Hanun, “Do you really think these men are coming here to honor your father? No! David has sent them to spy out the land so they can come in and conquer it!”"
1 Chronicles,19,4,"So Hanun seized David’s ambassadors and shaved them, cut off their robes at the buttocks, and sent them back to David in shame."
1 Chronicles,19,5,"When David heard what had happened to the men, he sent messengers to tell them, “Stay at Jericho until your beards grow out, and then come back.” For they felt deep shame because of their appearance."
1 Chronicles,19,6,"When the people of Ammon realized how seriously they had angered David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent 75,000 pounds of silver to hire chariots and charioteers from Aram-naharaim, Aram-maacah, and Zobah."
1 Chronicles,19,7,"They also hired 32,000 chariots and secured the support of the king of Maacah and his army. These forces camped at Medeba, where they were joined by the Ammonite troops that Hanun had recruited from his own towns."
1 Chronicles,19,8,"When David heard about this, he sent Joab and all his warriors to fight them."
1 Chronicles,19,9,"The Ammonite troops came out and drew up their battle lines at the entrance of the city, while the other kings positioned themselves to fight in the open fields."
1 Chronicles,19,10,"When Joab saw that he would have to fight on both the front and the rear, he chose some of Israel’s elite troops and placed them under his personal command to fight the Arameans in the fields."
1 Chronicles,19,11,"He left the rest of the army under the command of his brother Abishai, who was to attack the Ammonites."
1 Chronicles,19,12,"“If the Arameans are too strong for me, then come over and help me,” Joab told his brother. “And if the Ammonites are too strong for you, I will help you."
1 Chronicles,19,13,Be courageous! Let us fight bravely for our people and the cities of our God. May the LORD’s will be done.”
1 Chronicles,19,14,"When Joab and his troops attacked, the Arameans began to run away."
1 Chronicles,19,15,"And when the Ammonites saw the Arameans running, they also ran from Abishai and retreated into the city. Then Joab returned to Jerusalem."
1 Chronicles,19,16,"The Arameans now realized that they were no match for Israel, so they sent messengers and summoned additional Aramean troops from the other side of the Euphrates River. These troops were under the command of Shobach, the commander of Hadadezer’s forces."
1 Chronicles,19,17,"When David heard what was happening, he mobilized all Israel, crossed the Jordan River, and positioned his troops in battle formation. Then David engaged the Arameans in battle, and they fought against him."
1 Chronicles,19,18,"But again the Arameans fled from the Israelites. This time David’s forces killed 7,000 charioteers and 40,000 foot soldiers, including Shobach, the commander of their army."
1 Chronicles,19,19,"When Hadadezer’s allies saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they surrendered to David and became his subjects. After that, the Arameans were no longer willing to help the Ammonites."
1 Chronicles,20,1,"In the spring of the year, when kings normally go out to war, Joab led the Israelite army in successful attacks against the land of the Ammonites. In the process he laid siege to the city of Rabbah, attacking and destroying it. However, David stayed behind in Jerusalem."
1 Chronicles,20,2,"Then David went to Rabbah and removed the crown from the king’s head, and it was placed on his own head. The crown was made of gold and set with gems, and he found that it weighed seventy-five pounds. David took a vast amount of plunder from the city."
1 Chronicles,20,3,"He also made slaves of the people of Rabbah and forced them to labor with saws, iron picks, and iron axes. That is how David dealt with the people of all the Ammonite towns. Then David and all the army returned to Jerusalem."
1 Chronicles,20,4,"After this, war broke out with the Philistines at Gezer. As they fought, Sibbecai from Hushah killed Saph, a descendant of the giants, and so the Philistines were subdued."
1 Chronicles,20,5,"During another battle with the Philistines, Elhanan son of Jair killed Lahmi, the brother of Goliath of Gath. The handle of Lahmi’s spear was as thick as a weaver’s beam!"
1 Chronicles,20,6,"In another battle with the Philistines at Gath, they encountered a huge man with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in all, who was also a descendant of the giants."
1 Chronicles,20,7,"But when he defied and taunted Israel, he was killed by Jonathan, the son of David’s brother Shimea."
1 Chronicles,20,8,"These Philistines were descendants of the giants of Gath, but David and his warriors killed them."
1 Chronicles,21,1,Satan rose up against Israel and caused David to take a census of the people of Israel.
1 Chronicles,21,2,"So David said to Joab and the commanders of the army, “Take a census of all the people of Israel—from Beersheba in the south to Dan in the north—and bring me a report so I may know how many there are.”"
1 Chronicles,21,3,"But Joab replied, “May the LORD increase the number of his people a hundred times over! But why, my lord the king, do you want to do this? Are they not all your servants? Why must you cause Israel to sin?”"
1 Chronicles,21,4,"But the king insisted that they take the census, so Joab traveled throughout all Israel to count the people. Then he returned to Jerusalem"
1 Chronicles,21,5,"and reported the number of people to David. There were 1,100,000 warriors in all Israel who could handle a sword, and 470,000 in Judah."
1 Chronicles,21,6,But Joab did not include the tribes of Levi and Benjamin in the census because he was so distressed at what the king had made him do.
1 Chronicles,21,7,"God was very displeased with the census, and he punished Israel for it."
1 Chronicles,21,8,"Then David said to God, “I have sinned greatly by taking this census. Please forgive my guilt for doing this foolish thing.”"
1 Chronicles,21,9,"Then the LORD spoke to Gad, David’s seer. This was the message"
1 Chronicles,21,10,"“Go and say to David, ‘This is what the LORD says: I will give you three choices. Choose one of these punishments, and I will inflict it on you.’”"
1 Chronicles,21,11,"So Gad came to David and said, “These are the choices the LORD has given you."
1 Chronicles,21,12,"You may choose three years of famine, three months of destruction by the sword of your enemies, or three days of severe plague as the angel of the LORD brings devastation throughout the land of Israel. Decide what answer I should give the LORD who sent me.”"
1 Chronicles,21,13,"“I’m in a desperate situation!” David replied to Gad. “But let me fall into the hands of the LORD, for his mercy is very great. Do not let me fall into human hands.”"
1 Chronicles,21,14,"So the LORD sent a plague upon Israel, and 70,000 people died as a result."
1 Chronicles,21,15,"And God sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem. But just as the angel was preparing to destroy it, the LORD relented and said to the death angel, “Stop! That is enough!” At that moment the angel of the LORD was standing by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite."
1 Chronicles,21,16,"David looked up and saw the angel of the LORD standing between heaven and earth with his sword drawn, reaching out over Jerusalem. So David and the leaders of Israel put on burlap to show their deep distress and fell face down on the ground."
1 Chronicles,21,17,"And David said to God, “I am the one who called for the census! I am the one who has sinned and done wrong! But these people are as innocent as sheep—what have they done? O LORD my God, let your anger fall against me and my family, but do not destroy your people.”"
1 Chronicles,21,18,Then the angel of the LORD told Gad to instruct David to go up and build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
1 Chronicles,21,19,So David went up to do what the LORD had commanded him through Gad.
1 Chronicles,21,20,"Araunah, who was busy threshing wheat at the time, turned and saw the angel there. His four sons, who were with him, ran away and hid."
1 Chronicles,21,21,"When Araunah saw David approaching, he left his threshing floor and bowed before David with his face to the ground."
1 Chronicles,21,22,"David said to Araunah, “Let me buy this threshing floor from you at its full price. Then I will build an altar to the LORD there, so that he will stop the plague.”"
1 Chronicles,21,23,"“Take it, my lord the king, and use it as you wish,” Araunah said to David. “I will give the oxen for the burnt offerings, and the threshing boards for wood to build a fire on the altar, and the wheat for the grain offering. I will give it all to you.”"
1 Chronicles,21,24,"But King David replied to Araunah, “No, I insist on buying it for the full price. I will not take what is yours and give it to the LORD. I will not present burnt offerings that have cost me nothing!”"
1 Chronicles,21,25,So David gave Araunah 600 pieces of gold in payment for the threshing floor.
1 Chronicles,21,26,"David built an altar there to the LORD and sacrificed burnt offerings and peace offerings. And when David prayed, the LORD answered him by sending fire from heaven to burn up the offering on the altar."
1 Chronicles,21,27,"Then the LORD spoke to the angel, who put the sword back into its sheath."
1 Chronicles,21,28,"When David saw that the LORD had answered his prayer, he offered sacrifices there at Araunah’s threshing floor."
1 Chronicles,21,29,At that time the Tabernacle of the LORD and the altar of burnt offering that Moses had made in the wilderness were located at the place of worship in Gibeon.
1 Chronicles,21,30,"But David was not able to go there to inquire of God, because he was terrified by the drawn sword of the angel of the LORD."
1 Chronicles,22,1,"Then David said, “This will be the location for the Temple of the LORD God and the place of the altar for Israel’s burnt offerings!”"
1 Chronicles,22,2,"So David gave orders to call together the foreigners living in Israel, and he assigned them the task of preparing finished stone for building the Temple of God."
1 Chronicles,22,3,"David provided large amounts of iron for the nails that would be needed for the doors in the gates and for the clamps, and he gave more bronze than could be weighed."
1 Chronicles,22,4,"He also provided innumerable cedar logs, for the men of Tyre and Sidon had brought vast amounts of cedar to David."
1 Chronicles,22,5,"David said, “My son Solomon is still young and inexperienced. And since the Temple to be built for the LORD must be a magnificent structure, famous and glorious throughout the world, I will begin making preparations for it now.” So David collected vast amounts of building materials before his death."
1 Chronicles,22,6,"Then David sent for his son Solomon and instructed him to build a Temple for the LORD, the God of Israel."
1 Chronicles,22,7,"“My son, I wanted to build a Temple to honor the name of the LORD my God,” David told him."
1 Chronicles,22,8,"“But the LORD said to me, ‘You have killed many men in the battles you have fought. And since you have shed so much blood in my sight, you will not be the one to build a Temple to honor my name."
1 Chronicles,22,9,"But you will have a son who will be a man of peace. I will give him peace with his enemies in all the surrounding lands. His name will be Solomon, and I will give peace and quiet to Israel during his reign."
1 Chronicles,22,10,"He is the one who will build a Temple to honor my name. He will be my son, and I will be his father. And I will secure the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.’"
1 Chronicles,22,11,"“Now, my son, may the LORD be with you and give you success as you follow his directions in building the Temple of the LORD your God."
1 Chronicles,22,12,"And may the LORD give you wisdom and understanding, that you may obey the Law of the LORD your God as you rule over Israel."
1 Chronicles,22,13,For you will be successful if you carefully obey the decrees and regulations that the LORD gave to Israel through Moses. Be strong and courageous; do not be afraid or lose heart!
1 Chronicles,22,14,"“I have worked hard to provide materials for building the Temple of the LORD—nearly 4,000 tons of gold, 40,000 tons of silver, and so much iron and bronze that it cannot be weighed. I have also gathered timber and stone for the walls, though you may need to add more."
1 Chronicles,22,15,You have a large number of skilled stonemasons and carpenters and craftsmen of every kind.
1 Chronicles,22,16,"You have expert goldsmiths and silversmiths and workers of bronze and iron. Now begin the work, and may the LORD be with you!”"
1 Chronicles,22,17,Then David ordered all the leaders of Israel to assist Solomon in this project.
1 Chronicles,22,18,"“The LORD your God is with you,” he declared. “He has given you peace with the surrounding nations. He has handed them over to me, and they are now subject to the LORD and his people."
1 Chronicles,22,19,Now seek the LORD your God with all your heart and soul. Build the sanctuary of the LORD God so that you can bring the Ark of the LORD’s Covenant and the holy vessels of God into the Temple built to honor the LORD’s name.”
1 Chronicles,23,1,"When David was an old man, he appointed his son Solomon to be king over Israel."
1 Chronicles,23,2,"David summoned all the leaders of Israel, together with the priests and Levites."
1 Chronicles,23,3,"All the Levites who were thirty years old or older were counted, and the total came to 38,000."
1 Chronicles,23,4,"Then David said, “From all the Levites, 24,000 will supervise the work at the Temple of the LORD. Another 6,000 will serve as officials and judges."
1 Chronicles,23,5,"Another 4,000 will work as gatekeepers, and 4,000 will praise the LORD with the musical instruments I have made.”"
1 Chronicles,23,6,"Then David divided the Levites into divisions named after the clans descended from the three sons of Levi—Gershon, Kohath, and Merari."

1 Chronicles,23,24,"These were the descendants of Levi by clans, the leaders of their family groups, registered carefully by name. Each had to be twenty years old or older to qualify for service in the house of the LORD."
1 Chronicles,23,25,"For David said, “The LORD, the God of Israel, has given us peace, and he will always live in Jerusalem."
1 Chronicles,23,26,Now the Levites will no longer need to carry the Tabernacle and its furnishings from place to place.”
1 Chronicles,23,27,"In accordance with David’s final instructions, all the Levites twenty years old or older were registered for service."
1 Chronicles,23,28,"The work of the Levites was to assist the priests, the descendants of Aaron, as they served at the house of the LORD. They also took care of the courtyards and side rooms, helped perform the ceremonies of purification, and served in many other ways in the house of God."
1 Chronicles,23,29,"They were in charge of the sacred bread that was set out on the table, the choice flour for the grain offerings, the wafers made without yeast, the cakes cooked in olive oil, and the other mixed breads. They were also responsible to check all the weights and measures."

1 Chronicles,23,31,"They assisted with the burnt offerings that were presented to the LORD on Sabbath days, at new moon celebrations, and at all the appointed festivals. The required number of Levites served in the LORD’s presence at all times, following all the procedures they had been given."
