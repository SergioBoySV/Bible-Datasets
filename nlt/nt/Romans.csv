Romans,1,1,"This letter is from Paul, a slave of Christ Jesus, chosen by God to be an apostle and sent out to preach his Good News."
Romans,1,2,God promised this Good News long ago through his prophets in the holy Scriptures.
Romans,1,3,"The Good News is about his Son. In his earthly life he was born into King David’s family line,"
Romans,1,4,and he was shown to be the Son of God when he was raised from the dead by the power of the Holy Spirit. He is Jesus Christ our Lord.
Romans,1,5,"Through Christ, God has given us the privilege and authority as apostles to tell Gentiles everywhere what God has done for them, so that they will believe and obey him, bringing glory to his name."
Romans,1,6,And you are included among those Gentiles who have been called to belong to Jesus Christ.
Romans,1,7,I am writing to all of you in Rome who are loved by God and are called to be his own holy people. May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace.
Romans,1,8,"Let me say first that I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith in him is being talked about all over the world."
Romans,1,9,"God knows how often I pray for you. Day and night I bring you and your needs in prayer to God, whom I serve with all my heart by spreading the Good News about his Son."
Romans,1,10,"One of the things I always pray for is the opportunity, God willing, to come at last to see you."
Romans,1,11,For I long to visit you so I can bring you some spiritual gift that will help you grow strong in the Lord.
Romans,1,12,"When we get together, I want to encourage you in your faith, but I also want to be encouraged by yours."
Romans,1,13,"I want you to know, dear brothers and sisters, that I planned many times to visit you, but I was prevented until now. I want to work among you and see spiritual fruit, just as I have seen among other Gentiles."
Romans,1,14,"For I have a great sense of obligation to people in both the civilized world and the rest of the world, to the educated and uneducated alike."
Romans,1,15,"So I am eager to come to you in Rome, too, to preach the Good News."
Romans,1,16,"For I am not ashamed of this Good News about Christ. It is the power of God at work, saving everyone who believes—the Jew first and also the Gentile."
Romans,1,17,"This Good News tells us how God makes us right in his sight. This is accomplished from start to finish by faith. As the Scriptures say, “It is through faith that a righteous person has life.”"
Romans,1,18,"But God shows his anger from heaven against all sinful, wicked people who suppress the truth by their wickedness."
Romans,1,19,They know the truth about God because he has made it obvious to them.
Romans,1,20,"For ever since the world was created, people have seen the earth and sky. Through everything God made, they can clearly see his invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature. So they have no excuse for not knowing God."
Romans,1,21,"Yes, they knew God, but they wouldn’t worship him as God or even give him thanks. And they began to think up foolish ideas of what God was like. As a result, their minds became dark and confused."
Romans,1,22,"Claiming to be wise, they instead became utter fools."
Romans,1,23,"And instead of worshiping the glorious, ever-living God, they worshiped idols made to look like mere people and birds and animals and reptiles."
Romans,1,24,"So God abandoned them to do whatever shameful things their hearts desired. As a result, they did vile and degrading things with each other’s bodies."
Romans,1,25,"They traded the truth about God for a lie. So they worshiped and served the things God created instead of the Creator himself, who is worthy of eternal praise! Amen."
Romans,1,26,That is why God abandoned them to their shameful desires. Even the women turned against the natural way to have sex and instead indulged in sex with each other.
Romans,1,27,"And the men, instead of having normal sexual relations with women, burned with lust for each other. Men did shameful things with other men, and as a result of this sin, they suffered within themselves the penalty they deserved."
Romans,1,28,"Since they thought it foolish to acknowledge God, he abandoned them to their foolish thinking and let them do things that should never be done."
Romans,1,29,"Their lives became full of every kind of wickedness, sin, greed, hate, envy, murder, quarreling, deception, malicious behavior, and gossip."
Romans,1,30,"They are backstabbers, haters of God, insolent, proud, and boastful. They invent new ways of sinning, and they disobey their parents."
Romans,1,31,"They refuse to understand, break their promises, are heartless, and have no mercy."
Romans,1,32,"They know God’s justice requires that those who do these things deserve to die, yet they do them anyway. Worse yet, they encourage others to do them, too."
Romans,2,1,"You may think you can condemn such people, but you are just as bad, and you have no excuse! When you say they are wicked and should be punished, you are condemning yourself, for you who judge others do these very same things."
Romans,2,2,"And we know that God, in his justice, will punish anyone who does such things."
Romans,2,3,"Since you judge others for doing these things, why do you think you can avoid God’s judgment when you do the same things?"
Romans,2,4,"Don’t you see how wonderfully kind, tolerant, and patient God is with you? Does this mean nothing to you? Can’t you see that his kindness is intended to turn you from your sin?"
Romans,2,5,"But because you are stubborn and refuse to turn from your sin, you are storing up terrible punishment for yourself. For a day of anger is coming, when God’s righteous judgment will be revealed."
Romans,2,6,He will judge everyone according to what they have done.
Romans,2,7,"He will give eternal life to those who keep on doing good, seeking after the glory and honor and immortality that God offers."
Romans,2,8,"But he will pour out his anger and wrath on those who live for themselves, who refuse to obey the truth and instead live lives of wickedness."
Romans,2,9,There will be trouble and calamity for everyone who keeps on doing what is evil—for the Jew first and also for the Gentile.
Romans,2,10,But there will be glory and honor and peace from God for all who do good—for the Jew first and also for the Gentile.
Romans,2,11,For God does not show favoritism.
Romans,2,12,"When the Gentiles sin, they will be destroyed, even though they never had God’s written law. And the Jews, who do have God’s law, will be judged by that law when they fail to obey it."
Romans,2,13,For merely listening to the law doesn’t make us right with God. It is obeying the law that makes us right in his sight.
Romans,2,14,"Even Gentiles, who do not have God’s written law, show that they know his law when they instinctively obey it, even without having heard it."
Romans,2,15,"They demonstrate that God’s law is written in their hearts, for their own conscience and thoughts either accuse them or tell them they are doing right."
Romans,2,16,"And this is the message I proclaim—that the day is coming when God, through Christ Jesus, will judge everyone’s secret life."
Romans,2,17,"You who call yourselves Jews are relying on God’s law, and you boast about your special relationship with him."
Romans,2,18,You know what he wants; you know what is right because you have been taught his law.
Romans,2,19,You are convinced that you are a guide for the blind and a light for people who are lost in darkness.
Romans,2,20,You think you can instruct the ignorant and teach children the ways of God. For you are certain that God’s law gives you complete knowledge and truth.
Romans,2,21,"Well then, if you teach others, why don’t you teach yourself? You tell others not to steal, but do you steal?"
Romans,2,22,"You say it is wrong to commit adultery, but do you commit adultery? You condemn idolatry, but do you use items stolen from pagan temples?"
Romans,2,23,"You are so proud of knowing the law, but you dishonor God by breaking it."
Romans,2,24,"No wonder the Scriptures say, “The Gentiles blaspheme the name of God because of you.”"
Romans,2,25,"The Jewish ceremony of circumcision has value only if you obey God’s law. But if you don’t obey God’s law, you are no better off than an uncircumcised Gentile."
Romans,2,26,"And if the Gentiles obey God’s law, won’t God declare them to be his own people?"
Romans,2,27,"In fact, uncircumcised Gentiles who keep God’s law will condemn you Jews who are circumcised and possess God’s law but don’t obey it."
Romans,2,28,For you are not a true Jew just because you were born of Jewish parents or because you have gone through the ceremony of circumcision.
Romans,2,29,"No, a true Jew is one whose heart is right with God. And true circumcision is not merely obeying the letter of the law; rather, it is a change of heart produced by the Spirit. And a person with a changed heart seeks praise from God, not from people."
Romans,3,1,Then what’s the advantage of being a Jew? Is there any value in the ceremony of circumcision?
Romans,3,2,"Yes, there are great benefits! First of all, the Jews were entrusted with the whole revelation of God."
Romans,3,3,"True, some of them were unfaithful; but just because they were unfaithful, does that mean God will be unfaithful?"
Romans,3,4,"Of course not! Even if everyone else is a liar, God is true. As the Scriptures say about him, “You will be proved right in what you say, and you will win your case in court.”"
Romans,3,5,"“But,” some might say, “our sinfulness serves a good purpose, for it helps people see how righteous God is. Isn’t it unfair, then, for him to punish us?” (This is merely a human point of view.)"
Romans,3,6,"Of course not! If God were not entirely fair, how would he be qualified to judge the world?"
Romans,3,7,"“But,” someone might still argue, “how can God condemn me as a sinner if my dishonesty highlights his truthfulness and brings him more glory?”"
Romans,3,8,"And some people even slander us by claiming that we say, “The more we sin, the better it is!” Those who say such things deserve to be condemned."
Romans,3,9,"Well then, should we conclude that we Jews are better than others? No, not at all, for we have already shown that all people, whether Jews or Gentiles, are under the power of sin."
Romans,3,10,"As the Scriptures say, “No one is righteous— not even one."
Romans,3,11,No one is truly wise; no one is seeking God.
Romans,3,12,"All have turned away; all have become useless. No one does good, not a single one.”"
Romans,3,13,"“Their talk is foul, like the stench from an open grave. Their tongues are filled with lies.” “Snake venom drips from their lips.”"
Romans,3,14,“Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.”
Romans,3,15,“They rush to commit murder.
Romans,3,16,Destruction and misery always follow them.
Romans,3,17,They don’t know where to find peace.”
Romans,3,18,“They have no fear of God at all.”
Romans,3,19,"Obviously, the law applies to those to whom it was given, for its purpose is to keep people from having excuses, and to show that the entire world is guilty before God."
Romans,3,20,For no one can ever be made right with God by doing what the law commands. The law simply shows us how sinful we are.
Romans,3,21,"But now God has shown us a way to be made right with him without keeping the requirements of the law, as was promised in the writings of Moses and the prophets long ago."
Romans,3,22,"We are made right with God by placing our faith in Jesus Christ. And this is true for everyone who believes, no matter who we are."
Romans,3,23,For everyone has sinned; we all fall short of God’s glorious standard.
Romans,3,24,"Yet God, in his grace, freely makes us right in his sight. He did this through Christ Jesus when he freed us from the penalty for our sins."
Romans,3,25,"For God presented Jesus as the sacrifice for sin. People are made right with God when they believe that Jesus sacrificed his life, shedding his blood. This sacrifice shows that God was being fair when he held back and did not punish those who sinned in times past,"
Romans,3,26,"for he was looking ahead and including them in what he would do in this present time. God did this to demonstrate his righteousness, for he himself is fair and just, and he makes sinners right in his sight when they believe in Jesus."
Romans,3,27,"Can we boast, then, that we have done anything to be accepted by God? No, because our acquittal is not based on obeying the law. It is based on faith."
Romans,3,28,So we are made right with God through faith and not by obeying the law.
Romans,3,29,"After all, is God the God of the Jews only? Isn’t he also the God of the Gentiles? Of course he is."
Romans,3,30,"There is only one God, and he makes people right with himself only by faith, whether they are Jews or Gentiles."
Romans,3,31,"Well then, if we emphasize faith, does this mean that we can forget about the law? Of course not! In fact, only when we have faith do we truly fulfill the law."
Romans,4,1,"Abraham was, humanly speaking, the founder of our Jewish nation. What did he discover about being made right with God?"
Romans,4,2,"If his good deeds had made him acceptable to God, he would have had something to boast about. But that was not God’s way."
Romans,4,3,"For the Scriptures tell us, “Abraham believed God, and God counted him as righteous because of his faith.”"
Romans,4,4,"When people work, their wages are not a gift, but something they have earned."
Romans,4,5,"But people are counted as righteous, not because of their work, but because of their faith in God who forgives sinners."
Romans,4,6,David also spoke of this when he described the happiness of those who are declared righteous without working for it:
Romans,4,7,"“Oh, what joy for those whose disobedience is forgiven, whose sins are put out of sight."
Romans,4,8,"Yes, what joy for those whose record the Lord has cleared of sin.”"
Romans,4,9,"Now, is this blessing only for the Jews, or is it also for uncircumcised Gentiles? Well, we have been saying that Abraham was counted as righteous by God because of his faith."
Romans,4,10,"But how did this happen? Was he counted as righteous only after he was circumcised, or was it before he was circumcised? Clearly, God accepted Abraham before he was circumcised!"
Romans,4,11,Circumcision was a sign that Abraham already had faith and that God had already accepted him and declared him to be righteous—even before he was circumcised. So Abraham is the spiritual father of those who have faith but have not been circumcised. They are counted as righteous because of their faith.
Romans,4,12,"And Abraham is also the spiritual father of those who have been circumcised, but only if they have the same kind of faith Abraham had before he was circumcised."
Romans,4,13,"Clearly, God’s promise to give the whole earth to Abraham and his descendants was based not on his obedience to God’s law, but on a right relationship with God that comes by faith."
Romans,4,14,"If God’s promise is only for those who obey the law, then faith is not necessary and the promise is pointless."
Romans,4,15,For the law always brings punishment on those who try to obey it. (The only way to avoid breaking the law is to have no law to break!)
Romans,4,16,"So the promise is received by faith. It is given as a free gift. And we are all certain to receive it, whether or not we live according to the law of Moses, if we have faith like Abraham’s. For Abraham is the father of all who believe."
Romans,4,17,"That is what the Scriptures mean when God told him, “I have made you the father of many nations.” This happened because Abraham believed in the God who brings the dead back to life and who creates new things out of nothing."
Romans,4,18,"Even when there was no reason for hope, Abraham kept hoping—believing that he would become the father of many nations. For God had said to him, “That’s how many descendants you will have!”"
Romans,4,19,"And Abraham’s faith did not weaken, even though, at about 100 years of age, he figured his body was as good as dead—and so was Sarah’s womb."
Romans,4,20,"Abraham never wavered in believing God’s promise. In fact, his faith grew stronger, and in this he brought glory to God."
Romans,4,21,He was fully convinced that God is able to do whatever he promises.
Romans,4,22,"And because of Abraham’s faith, God counted him as righteous."
Romans,4,23,"And when God counted him as righteous, it wasn’t just for Abraham’s benefit. It was recorded"
Romans,4,24,"for our benefit, too, assuring us that God will also count us as righteous if we believe in him, the one who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead."
Romans,4,25,"He was handed over to die because of our sins, and he was raised to life to make us right with God."
Romans,5,1,"Therefore, since we have been made right in God’s sight by faith, we have peace with God because of what Jesus Christ our Lord has done for us."
Romans,5,2,"Because of our faith, Christ has brought us into this place of undeserved privilege where we now stand, and we confidently and joyfully look forward to sharing God’s glory."
Romans,5,3,"We can rejoice, too, when we run into problems and trials, for we know that they help us develop endurance."
Romans,5,4,"And endurance develops strength of character, and character strengthens our confident hope of salvation."
Romans,5,5,"And this hope will not lead to disappointment. For we know how dearly God loves us, because he has given us the Holy Spirit to fill our hearts with his love."
Romans,5,6,"When we were utterly helpless, Christ came at just the right time and died for us sinners."
Romans,5,7,"Now, most people would not be willing to die for an upright person, though someone might perhaps be willing to die for a person who is especially good."
Romans,5,8,But God showed his great love for us by sending Christ to die for us while we were still sinners.
Romans,5,9,"And since we have been made right in God’s sight by the blood of Christ, he will certainly save us from God’s condemnation."
Romans,5,10,"For since our friendship with God was restored by the death of his Son while we were still his enemies, we will certainly be saved through the life of his Son."
Romans,5,11,So now we can rejoice in our wonderful new relationship with God because our Lord Jesus Christ has made us friends of God.
Romans,5,12,"When Adam sinned, sin entered the world. Adam’s sin brought death, so death spread to everyone, for everyone sinned."
Romans,5,13,"Yes, people sinned even before the law was given. But it was not counted as sin because there was not yet any law to break."
Romans,5,14,"Still, everyone died—from the time of Adam to the time of Moses—even those who did not disobey an explicit commandment of God, as Adam did. Now Adam is a symbol, a representation of Christ, who was yet to come."
Romans,5,15,"But there is a great difference between Adam’s sin and God’s gracious gift. For the sin of this one man, Adam, brought death to many. But even greater is God’s wonderful grace and his gift of forgiveness to many through this other man, Jesus Christ."
Romans,5,16,"And the result of God’s gracious gift is very different from the result of that one man’s sin. For Adam’s sin led to condemnation, but God’s free gift leads to our being made right with God, even though we are guilty of many sins."
Romans,5,17,"For the sin of this one man, Adam, caused death to rule over many. But even greater is God’s wonderful grace and his gift of righteousness, for all who receive it will live in triumph over sin and death through this one man, Jesus Christ."
Romans,5,18,"Yes, Adam’s one sin brings condemnation for everyone, but Christ’s one act of righteousness brings a right relationship with God and new life for everyone."
Romans,5,19,"Because one person disobeyed God, many became sinners. But because one other person obeyed God, many will be made righteous."
Romans,5,20,"God’s law was given so that all people could see how sinful they were. But as people sinned more and more, God’s wonderful grace became more abundant."
Romans,5,21,"So just as sin ruled over all people and brought them to death, now God’s wonderful grace rules instead, giving us right standing with God and resulting in eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
Romans,6,1,"Well then, should we keep on sinning so that God can show us more and more of his wonderful grace?"
Romans,6,2,"Of course not! Since we have died to sin, how can we continue to live in it?"
Romans,6,3,"Or have you forgotten that when we were joined with Christ Jesus in baptism, we joined him in his death?"
Romans,6,4,"For we died and were buried with Christ by baptism. And just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glorious power of the Father, now we also may live new lives."
Romans,6,5,"Since we have been united with him in his death, we will also be raised to life as he was."
Romans,6,6,We know that our old sinful selves were crucified with Christ so that sin might lose its power in our lives. We are no longer slaves to sin.
Romans,6,7,For when we died with Christ we were set free from the power of sin.
Romans,6,8,"And since we died with Christ, we know we will also live with him."
Romans,6,9,"We are sure of this because Christ was raised from the dead, and he will never die again. Death no longer has any power over him."
Romans,6,10,"When he died, he died once to break the power of sin. But now that he lives, he lives for the glory of God."
Romans,6,11,So you also should consider yourselves to be dead to the power of sin and alive to God through Christ Jesus.
Romans,6,12,Do not let sin control the way you live; do not give in to sinful desires.
Romans,6,13,"Do not let any part of your body become an instrument of evil to serve sin. Instead, give yourselves completely to God, for you were dead, but now you have new life. So use your whole body as an instrument to do what is right for the glory of God."
Romans,6,14,"Sin is no longer your master, for you no longer live under the requirements of the law. Instead, you live under the freedom of God’s grace."
Romans,6,15,"Well then, since God’s grace has set us free from the law, does that mean we can go on sinning? Of course not!"
Romans,6,16,"Don’t you realize that you become the slave of whatever you choose to obey? You can be a slave to sin, which leads to death, or you can choose to obey God, which leads to righteous living."
Romans,6,17,"Thank God! Once you were slaves of sin, but now you wholeheartedly obey this teaching we have given you."
Romans,6,18,"Now you are free from your slavery to sin, and you have become slaves to righteous living."
Romans,6,19,"Because of the weakness of your human nature, I am using the illustration of slavery to help you understand all this. Previously, you let yourselves be slaves to impurity and lawlessness, which led ever deeper into sin. Now you must give yourselves to be slaves to righteous living so that you will become holy."
Romans,6,20,"When you were slaves to sin, you were free from the obligation to do right."
Romans,6,21,"And what was the result? You are now ashamed of the things you used to do, things that end in eternal doom."
Romans,6,22,But now you are free from the power of sin and have become slaves of God. Now you do those things that lead to holiness and result in eternal life.
Romans,6,23,"For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord."
Romans,7,1,"Now, dear brothers and sisters —you who are familiar with the law—don’t you know that the law applies only while a person is living?"
Romans,7,2,"For example, when a woman marries, the law binds her to her husband as long as he is alive. But if he dies, the laws of marriage no longer apply to her."
Romans,7,3,"So while her husband is alive, she would be committing adultery if she married another man. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law and does not commit adultery when she remarries."
Romans,7,4,"So, my dear brothers and sisters, this is the point: You died to the power of the law when you died with Christ. And now you are united with the one who was raised from the dead. As a result, we can produce a harvest of good deeds for God."
Romans,7,5,"When we were controlled by our old nature, sinful desires were at work within us, and the law aroused these evil desires that produced a harvest of sinful deeds, resulting in death."
Romans,7,6,"But now we have been released from the law, for we died to it and are no longer captive to its power. Now we can serve God, not in the old way of obeying the letter of the law, but in the new way of living in the Spirit."
Romans,7,7,"Well then, am I suggesting that the law of God is sinful? Of course not! In fact, it was the law that showed me my sin. I would never have known that coveting is wrong if the law had not said, “You must not covet.”"
Romans,7,8,"But sin used this command to arouse all kinds of covetous desires within me! If there were no law, sin would not have that power."
Romans,7,9,"At one time I lived without understanding the law. But when I learned the command not to covet, for instance, the power of sin came to life,"
Romans,7,10,"and I died. So I discovered that the law’s commands, which were supposed to bring life, brought spiritual death instead."
Romans,7,11,Sin took advantage of those commands and deceived me; it used the commands to kill me.
Romans,7,12,"But still, the law itself is holy, and its commands are holy and right and good."
Romans,7,13,"But how can that be? Did the law, which is good, cause my death? Of course not! Sin used what was good to bring about my condemnation to death. So we can see how terrible sin really is. It uses God’s good commands for its own evil purposes."
Romans,7,14,"So the trouble is not with the law, for it is spiritual and good. The trouble is with me, for I am all too human, a slave to sin."
Romans,7,15,"I don’t really understand myself, for I want to do what is right, but I don’t do it. Instead, I do what I hate."
Romans,7,16,"But if I know that what I am doing is wrong, this shows that I agree that the law is good."
Romans,7,17,So I am not the one doing wrong; it is sin living in me that does it.
Romans,7,18,"And I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature. I want to do what is right, but I can’t."
Romans,7,19,"I want to do what is good, but I don’t. I don’t want to do what is wrong, but I do it anyway."
Romans,7,20,"But if I do what I don’t want to do, I am not really the one doing wrong; it is sin living in me that does it."
Romans,7,21,"I have discovered this principle of life—that when I want to do what is right, I inevitably do what is wrong."
Romans,7,22,I love God’s law with all my heart.
Romans,7,23,But there is another power within me that is at war with my mind. This power makes me a slave to the sin that is still within me.
Romans,7,24,"Oh, what a miserable person I am! Who will free me from this life that is dominated by sin and death?"
Romans,7,25,"Thank God! The answer is in Jesus Christ our Lord. So you see how it is: In my mind I really want to obey God’s law, but because of my sinful nature I am a slave to sin."
Romans,8,1,So now there is no condemnation for those who belong to Christ Jesus.
Romans,8,2,"And because you belong to him, the power of the life-giving Spirit has freed you from the power of sin that leads to death."
Romans,8,3,The law of Moses was unable to save us because of the weakness of our sinful nature. So God did what the law could not do. He sent his own Son in a body like the bodies we sinners have. And in that body God declared an end to sin’s control over us by giving his Son as a sacrifice for our sins.
Romans,8,4,"He did this so that the just requirement of the law would be fully satisfied for us, who no longer follow our sinful nature but instead follow the Spirit."
Romans,8,5,"Those who are dominated by the sinful nature think about sinful things, but those who are controlled by the Holy Spirit think about things that please the Spirit."
Romans,8,6,So letting your sinful nature control your mind leads to death. But letting the Spirit control your mind leads to life and peace.
Romans,8,7,"For the sinful nature is always hostile to God. It never did obey God’s laws, and it never will."
Romans,8,8,That’s why those who are still under the control of their sinful nature can never please God.
Romans,8,9,But you are not controlled by your sinful nature. You are controlled by the Spirit if you have the Spirit of God living in you. (And remember that those who do not have the Spirit of Christ living in them do not belong to him at all.)
Romans,8,10,"And Christ lives within you, so even though your body will die because of sin, the Spirit gives you life because you have been made right with God."
Romans,8,11,"The Spirit of God, who raised Jesus from the dead, lives in you. And just as God raised Christ Jesus from the dead, he will give life to your mortal bodies by this same Spirit living within you."
Romans,8,12,"Therefore, dear brothers and sisters, you have no obligation to do what your sinful nature urges you to do."
Romans,8,13,"For if you live by its dictates, you will die. But if through the power of the Spirit you put to death the deeds of your sinful nature, you will live."
Romans,8,14,For all who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God.
Romans,8,15,"So you have not received a spirit that makes you fearful slaves. Instead, you received God’s Spirit when he adopted you as his own children. Now we call him, “Abba, Father.”"
Romans,8,16,For his Spirit joins with our spirit to affirm that we are God’s children.
Romans,8,17,"And since we are his children, we are his heirs. In fact, together with Christ we are heirs of God’s glory. But if we are to share his glory, we must also share his suffering."
Romans,8,18,Yet what we suffer now is nothing compared to the glory he will reveal to us later.
Romans,8,19,For all creation is waiting eagerly for that future day when God will reveal who his children really are.
Romans,8,20,"Against its will, all creation was subjected to God’s curse. But with eager hope,"
Romans,8,21,the creation looks forward to the day when it will join God’s children in glorious freedom from death and decay.
Romans,8,22,For we know that all creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time.
Romans,8,23,"And we believers also groan, even though we have the Holy Spirit within us as a foretaste of future glory, for we long for our bodies to be released from sin and suffering. We, too, wait with eager hope for the day when God will give us our full rights as his adopted children, including the new bodies he has promised us."
Romans,8,24,"We were given this hope when we were saved. (If we already have something, we don’t need to hope for it."
Romans,8,25,"But if we look forward to something we don’t yet have, we must wait patiently and confidently.)"
Romans,8,26,"And the Holy Spirit helps us in our weakness. For example, we don’t know what God wants us to pray for. But the Holy Spirit prays for us with groanings that cannot be expressed in words."
Romans,8,27,"And the Father who knows all hearts knows what the Spirit is saying, for the Spirit pleads for us believers in harmony with God’s own will."
Romans,8,28,And we know that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to his purpose for them.
Romans,8,29,"For God knew his people in advance, and he chose them to become like his Son, so that his Son would be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters."
Romans,8,30,"And having chosen them, he called them to come to him. And having called them, he gave them right standing with himself. And having given them right standing, he gave them his glory."
Romans,8,31,"What shall we say about such wonderful things as these? If God is for us, who can ever be against us?"
Romans,8,32,"Since he did not spare even his own Son but gave him up for us all, won’t he also give us everything else?"
Romans,8,33,Who dares accuse us whom God has chosen for his own? No one—for God himself has given us right standing with himself.
Romans,8,34,"Who then will condemn us? No one—for Christ Jesus died for us and was raised to life for us, and he is sitting in the place of honor at God’s right hand, pleading for us."
Romans,8,35,"Can anything ever separate us from Christ’s love? Does it mean he no longer loves us if we have trouble or calamity, or are persecuted, or hungry, or destitute, or in danger, or threatened with death?"
Romans,8,36,"(As the Scriptures say, “For your sake we are killed every day; we are being slaughtered like sheep.”)"
Romans,8,37,"No, despite all these things, overwhelming victory is ours through Christ, who loved us."
Romans,8,38,"And I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from God’s love. Neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither our fears for today nor our worries about tomorrow—not even the powers of hell can separate us from God’s love."
Romans,8,39,"No power in the sky above or in the earth below—indeed, nothing in all creation will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is revealed in Christ Jesus our Lord."
Romans,9,1,"With Christ as my witness, I speak with utter truthfulness. My conscience and the Holy Spirit confirm it."
Romans,9,2,My heart is filled with bitter sorrow and unending grief
Romans,9,3,"for my people, my Jewish brothers and sisters. I would be willing to be forever cursed—cut off from Christ!—if that would save them."
Romans,9,4,"They are the people of Israel, chosen to be God’s adopted children. God revealed his glory to them. He made covenants with them and gave them his law. He gave them the privilege of worshiping him and receiving his wonderful promises."
Romans,9,5,"Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are their ancestors, and Christ himself was an Israelite as far as his human nature is concerned. And he is God, the one who rules over everything and is worthy of eternal praise! Amen."
Romans,9,6,"Well then, has God failed to fulfill his promise to Israel? No, for not all who are born into the nation of Israel are truly members of God’s people!"
Romans,9,7,"Being descendants of Abraham doesn’t make them truly Abraham’s children. For the Scriptures say, “Isaac is the son through whom your descendants will be counted,” though Abraham had other children, too."
Romans,9,8,This means that Abraham’s physical descendants are not necessarily children of God. Only the children of the promise are considered to be Abraham’s children.
Romans,9,9,"For God had promised, “I will return about this time next year, and Sarah will have a son.”"
Romans,9,10,"This son was our ancestor Isaac. When he married Rebekah, she gave birth to twins."
Romans,9,11,"But before they were born, before they had done anything good or bad, she received a message from God. (This message shows that God chooses people according to his own purposes;"
Romans,9,12,"he calls people, but not according to their good or bad works.) She was told, “Your older son will serve your younger son.”"
Romans,9,13,"In the words of the Scriptures, “I loved Jacob, but I rejected Esau.”"
Romans,9,14,"Are we saying, then, that God was unfair? Of course not!"
Romans,9,15,"For God said to Moses, “I will show mercy to anyone I choose, and I will show compassion to anyone I choose.”"
Romans,9,16,So it is God who decides to show mercy. We can neither choose it nor work for it.
Romans,9,17,"For the Scriptures say that God told Pharaoh, “I have appointed you for the very purpose of displaying my power in you and to spread my fame throughout the earth.”"
Romans,9,18,"So you see, God chooses to show mercy to some, and he chooses to harden the hearts of others so they refuse to listen."
Romans,9,19,"Well then, you might say, “Why does God blame people for not responding? Haven’t they simply done what he makes them do?”"
Romans,9,20,"No, don’t say that. Who are you, a mere human being, to argue with God? Should the thing that was created say to the one who created it, “Why have you made me like this?”"
Romans,9,21,"When a potter makes jars out of clay, doesn’t he have a right to use the same lump of clay to make one jar for decoration and another to throw garbage into?"
Romans,9,22,"In the same way, even though God has the right to show his anger and his power, he is very patient with those on whom his anger falls, who are destined for destruction."
Romans,9,23,"He does this to make the riches of his glory shine even brighter on those to whom he shows mercy, who were prepared in advance for glory."
Romans,9,24,"And we are among those whom he selected, both from the Jews and from the Gentiles."
Romans,9,25,"Concerning the Gentiles, God says in the prophecy of Hosea, “Those who were not my people, I will now call my people. And I will love those whom I did not love before.”"
Romans,9,26,"And, “Then, at the place where they were told, ‘You are not my people,’ there they will be called ‘children of the living God.’”"
Romans,9,27,"And concerning Israel, Isaiah the prophet cried out, “Though the people of Israel are as numerous as the sand of the seashore, only a remnant will be saved."
Romans,9,28,For the Lord will carry out his sentence upon the earth quickly and with finality.”
Romans,9,29,"And Isaiah said the same thing in another place: “If the Lord of Heaven’s Armies had not spared a few of our children, we would have been wiped out like Sodom, destroyed like Gomorrah.”"
Romans,9,30,"What does all this mean? Even though the Gentiles were not trying to follow God’s standards, they were made right with God. And it was by faith that this took place."
Romans,9,31,"But the people of Israel, who tried so hard to get right with God by keeping the law, never succeeded."
Romans,9,32,Why not? Because they were trying to get right with God by keeping the law instead of by trusting in him. They stumbled over the great rock in their path.
Romans,9,33,"God warned them of this in the Scriptures when he said, “I am placing a stone in Jerusalem that makes people stumble, a rock that makes them fall. But anyone who trusts in him will never be disgraced.”"
Romans,10,1,"Dear brothers and sisters, the longing of my heart and my prayer to God is for the people of Israel to be saved."
Romans,10,2,"I know what enthusiasm they have for God, but it is misdirected zeal."
Romans,10,3,"For they don’t understand God’s way of making people right with himself. Refusing to accept God’s way, they cling to their own way of getting right with God by trying to keep the law."
Romans,10,4,"For Christ has already accomplished the purpose for which the law was given. As a result, all who believe in him are made right with God."
Romans,10,5,For Moses writes that the law’s way of making a person right with God requires obedience to all of its commands.
Romans,10,6,"But faith’s way of getting right with God says, “Don’t say in your heart, ‘Who will go up to heaven?’ (to bring Christ down to earth)."
Romans,10,7,"And don’t say, ‘Who will go down to the place of the dead?’ (to bring Christ back to life again).”"
Romans,10,8,"In fact, it says, “The message is very close at hand; it is on your lips and in your heart.” And that message is the very message about faith that we preach:"
Romans,10,9,"If you openly declare that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."
Romans,10,10,"For it is by believing in your heart that you are made right with God, and it is by openly declaring your faith that you are saved."
Romans,10,11,"As the Scriptures tell us, “Anyone who trusts in him will never be disgraced.”"
Romans,10,12,"Jew and Gentile are the same in this respect. They have the same Lord, who gives generously to all who call on him."
Romans,10,13,For “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”
Romans,10,14,But how can they call on him to save them unless they believe in him? And how can they believe in him if they have never heard about him? And how can they hear about him unless someone tells them?
Romans,10,15,"And how will anyone go and tell them without being sent? That is why the Scriptures say, “How beautiful are the feet of messengers who bring good news!”"
Romans,10,16,"But not everyone welcomes the Good News, for Isaiah the prophet said, “ Lord , who has believed our message?”"
Romans,10,17,"So faith comes from hearing, that is, hearing the Good News about Christ."
Romans,10,18,"But I ask, have the people of Israel actually heard the message? Yes, they have: “The message has gone throughout the earth, and the words to all the world.”"
Romans,10,19,"But I ask, did the people of Israel really understand? Yes, they did, for even in the time of Moses, God said, “I will rouse your jealousy through people who are not even a nation. I will provoke your anger through the foolish Gentiles.”"
Romans,10,20,"And later Isaiah spoke boldly for God, saying, “I was found by people who were not looking for me. I showed myself to those who were not asking for me.”"
Romans,10,21,"But regarding Israel, God said, “All day long I opened my arms to them, but they were disobedient and rebellious.”"
Romans,11,1,"I ask, then, has God rejected his own people, the nation of Israel? Of course not! I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham and a member of the tribe of Benjamin."
Romans,11,2,"No, God has not rejected his own people, whom he chose from the very beginning. Do you realize what the Scriptures say about this? Elijah the prophet complained to God about the people of Israel and said,"
Romans,11,3,"“ Lord , they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars. I am the only one left, and now they are trying to kill me, too.”"
Romans,11,4,"And do you remember God’s reply? He said, “No, I have 7,000 others who have never bowed down to Baal!”"
Romans,11,5,"It is the same today, for a few of the people of Israel have remained faithful because of God’s grace—his undeserved kindness in choosing them."
Romans,11,6,"And since it is through God’s kindness, then it is not by their good works. For in that case, God’s grace would not be what it really is—free and undeserved."
Romans,11,7,So this is the situation: Most of the people of Israel have not found the favor of God they are looking for so earnestly. A few have—the ones God has chosen—but the hearts of the rest were hardened.
Romans,11,8,"As the Scriptures say, “God has put them into a deep sleep. To this day he has shut their eyes so they do not see, and closed their ears so they do not hear.”"
Romans,11,9,"Likewise, David said, “Let their bountiful table become a snare, a trap that makes them think all is well. Let their blessings cause them to stumble, and let them get what they deserve."
Romans,11,10,"Let their eyes go blind so they cannot see, and let their backs be bent forever.”"
Romans,11,11,"Did God’s people stumble and fall beyond recovery? Of course not! They were disobedient, so God made salvation available to the Gentiles. But he wanted his own people to become jealous and claim it for themselves."
Romans,11,12,"Now if the Gentiles were enriched because the people of Israel turned down God’s offer of salvation, think how much greater a blessing the world will share when they finally accept it."
Romans,11,13,"I am saying all this especially for you Gentiles. God has appointed me as the apostle to the Gentiles. I stress this,"
Romans,11,14,"for I want somehow to make the people of Israel jealous of what you Gentiles have, so I might save some of them."
Romans,11,15,"For since their rejection meant that God offered salvation to the rest of the world, their acceptance will be even more wonderful. It will be life for those who were dead!"
Romans,11,16,"And since Abraham and the other patriarchs were holy, their descendants will also be holy—just as the entire batch of dough is holy because the portion given as an offering is holy. For if the roots of the tree are holy, the branches will be, too."
Romans,11,17,"But some of these branches from Abraham’s tree—some of the people of Israel—have been broken off. And you Gentiles, who were branches from a wild olive tree, have been grafted in. So now you also receive the blessing God has promised Abraham and his children, sharing in the rich nourishment from the root of God’s special olive tree."
Romans,11,18,"But you must not brag about being grafted in to replace the branches that were broken off. You are just a branch, not the root."
Romans,11,19,"“Well,” you may say, “those branches were broken off to make room for me.”"
Romans,11,20,"Yes, but remember—those branches were broken off because they didn’t believe in Christ, and you are there because you do believe. So don’t think highly of yourself, but fear what could happen."
Romans,11,21,"For if God did not spare the original branches, he won’t spare you either."
Romans,11,22,"Notice how God is both kind and severe. He is severe toward those who disobeyed, but kind to you if you continue to trust in his kindness. But if you stop trusting, you also will be cut off."
Romans,11,23,"And if the people of Israel turn from their unbelief, they will be grafted in again, for God has the power to graft them back into the tree."
Romans,11,24,"You, by nature, were a branch cut from a wild olive tree. So if God was willing to do something contrary to nature by grafting you into his cultivated tree, he will be far more eager to graft the original branches back into the tree where they belong."
Romans,11,25,"I want you to understand this mystery, dear brothers and sisters, so that you will not feel proud about yourselves. Some of the people of Israel have hard hearts, but this will last only until the full number of Gentiles comes to Christ."
Romans,11,26,"And so all Israel will be saved. As the Scriptures say, “The one who rescues will come from Jerusalem, and he will turn Israel away from ungodliness."
Romans,11,27,"And this is my covenant with them, that I will take away their sins.”"
Romans,11,28,"Many of the people of Israel are now enemies of the Good News, and this benefits you Gentiles. Yet they are still the people he loves because he chose their ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."
Romans,11,29,For God’s gifts and his call can never be withdrawn.
Romans,11,30,"Once, you Gentiles were rebels against God, but when the people of Israel rebelled against him, God was merciful to you instead."
Romans,11,31,"Now they are the rebels, and God’s mercy has come to you so that they, too, will share in God’s mercy."
Romans,11,32,For God has imprisoned everyone in disobedience so he could have mercy on everyone.
Romans,11,33,"Oh, how great are God’s riches and wisdom and knowledge! How impossible it is for us to understand his decisions and his ways!"
Romans,11,34,For who can know the Lord ’s thoughts? Who knows enough to give him advice?
Romans,11,35,And who has given him so much that he needs to pay it back?
Romans,11,36,For everything comes from him and exists by his power and is intended for his glory. All glory to him forever! Amen.
Romans,12,1,"And so, dear brothers and sisters, I plead with you to give your bodies to God because of all he has done for you. Let them be a living and holy sacrifice—the kind he will find acceptable. This is truly the way to worship him."
Romans,12,2,"Don’t copy the behavior and customs of this world, but let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think. Then you will learn to know God’s will for you, which is good and pleasing and perfect."
Romans,12,3,"Because of the privilege and authority God has given me, I give each of you this warning: Don’t think you are better than you really are. Be honest in your evaluation of yourselves, measuring yourselves by the faith God has given us."
Romans,12,4,"Just as our bodies have many parts and each part has a special function,"
Romans,12,5,"so it is with Christ’s body. We are many parts of one body, and we all belong to each other."
Romans,12,6,"In his grace, God has given us different gifts for doing certain things well. So if God has given you the ability to prophesy, speak out with as much faith as God has given you."
Romans,12,7,"If your gift is serving others, serve them well. If you are a teacher, teach well."
Romans,12,8,"If your gift is to encourage others, be encouraging. If it is giving, give generously. If God has given you leadership ability, take the responsibility seriously. And if you have a gift for showing kindness to others, do it gladly."
Romans,12,9,Don’t just pretend to love others. Really love them. Hate what is wrong. Hold tightly to what is good.
Romans,12,10,"Love each other with genuine affection, and take delight in honoring each other."
Romans,12,11,"Never be lazy, but work hard and serve the Lord enthusiastically."
Romans,12,12,"Rejoice in our confident hope. Be patient in trouble, and keep on praying."
Romans,12,13,"When God’s people are in need, be ready to help them. Always be eager to practice hospitality."
Romans,12,14,Bless those who persecute you. Don’t curse them; pray that God will bless them.
Romans,12,15,"Be happy with those who are happy, and weep with those who weep."
Romans,12,16,Live in harmony with each other. Don’t be too proud to enjoy the company of ordinary people. And don’t think you know it all!
Romans,12,17,Never pay back evil with more evil. Do things in such a way that everyone can see you are honorable.
Romans,12,18,Do all that you can to live in peace with everyone.
Romans,12,19,"Dear friends, never take revenge. Leave that to the righteous anger of God. For the Scriptures say, “I will take revenge; I will pay them back,” says the Lord."
Romans,12,20,"Instead, “If your enemies are hungry, feed them. If they are thirsty, give them something to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals of shame on their heads.”"
Romans,12,21,"Don’t let evil conquer you, but conquer evil by doing good."
Romans,13,1,"Everyone must submit to governing authorities. For all authority comes from God, and those in positions of authority have been placed there by God."
Romans,13,2,"So anyone who rebels against authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and they will be punished."
Romans,13,3,"For the authorities do not strike fear in people who are doing right, but in those who are doing wrong. Would you like to live without fear of the authorities? Do what is right, and they will honor you."
Romans,13,4,"The authorities are God’s servants, sent for your good. But if you are doing wrong, of course you should be afraid, for they have the power to punish you. They are God’s servants, sent for the very purpose of punishing those who do what is wrong."
Romans,13,5,"So you must submit to them, not only to avoid punishment, but also to keep a clear conscience."
Romans,13,6,"Pay your taxes, too, for these same reasons. For government workers need to be paid. They are serving God in what they do."
Romans,13,7,"Give to everyone what you owe them: Pay your taxes and government fees to those who collect them, and give respect and honor to those who are in authority."
Romans,13,8,"Owe nothing to anyone—except for your obligation to love one another. If you love your neighbor, you will fulfill the requirements of God’s law."
Romans,13,9,"For the commandments say, “You must not commit adultery. You must not murder. You must not steal. You must not covet.” These—and other such commandments—are summed up in this one commandment: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”"
Romans,13,10,"Love does no wrong to others, so love fulfills the requirements of God’s law."
Romans,13,11,"This is all the more urgent, for you know how late it is; time is running out. Wake up, for our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed."
Romans,13,12,"The night is almost gone; the day of salvation will soon be here. So remove your dark deeds like dirty clothes, and put on the shining armor of right living."
Romans,13,13,"Because we belong to the day, we must live decent lives for all to see. Don’t participate in the darkness of wild parties and drunkenness, or in sexual promiscuity and immoral living, or in quarreling and jealousy."
Romans,13,14,"Instead, clothe yourself with the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ. And don’t let yourself think about ways to indulge your evil desires."
Romans,14,1,"Accept other believers who are weak in faith, and don’t argue with them about what they think is right or wrong."
Romans,14,2,"For instance, one person believes it’s all right to eat anything. But another believer with a sensitive conscience will eat only vegetables."
Romans,14,3,"Those who feel free to eat anything must not look down on those who don’t. And those who don’t eat certain foods must not condemn those who do, for God has accepted them."
Romans,14,4,"Who are you to condemn someone else’s servants? Their own master will judge whether they stand or fall. And with the Lord’s help, they will stand and receive his approval."
Romans,14,5,"In the same way, some think one day is more holy than another day, while others think every day is alike. You should each be fully convinced that whichever day you choose is acceptable."
Romans,14,6,"Those who worship the Lord on a special day do it to honor him. Those who eat any kind of food do so to honor the Lord, since they give thanks to God before eating. And those who refuse to eat certain foods also want to please the Lord and give thanks to God."
Romans,14,7,For we don’t live for ourselves or die for ourselves.
Romans,14,8,"If we live, it’s to honor the Lord. And if we die, it’s to honor the Lord. So whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord."
Romans,14,9,Christ died and rose again for this very purpose—to be Lord both of the living and of the dead.
Romans,14,10,"So why do you condemn another believer ? Why do you look down on another believer? Remember, we will all stand before the judgment seat of God."
Romans,14,11,"For the Scriptures say, “‘As surely as I live,’ says the Lord, ‘every knee will bend to me, and every tongue will declare allegiance to God. ’”"
Romans,14,12,"Yes, each of us will give a personal account to God."
Romans,14,13,So let’s stop condemning each other. Decide instead to live in such a way that you will not cause another believer to stumble and fall.
Romans,14,14,"I know and am convinced on the authority of the Lord Jesus that no food, in and of itself, is wrong to eat. But if someone believes it is wrong, then for that person it is wrong."
Romans,14,15,"And if another believer is distressed by what you eat, you are not acting in love if you eat it. Don’t let your eating ruin someone for whom Christ died."
Romans,14,16,Then you will not be criticized for doing something you believe is good.
Romans,14,17,"For the Kingdom of God is not a matter of what we eat or drink, but of living a life of goodness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit."
Romans,14,18,"If you serve Christ with this attitude, you will please God, and others will approve of you, too."
Romans,14,19,"So then, let us aim for harmony in the church and try to build each other up."
Romans,14,20,"Don’t tear apart the work of God over what you eat. Remember, all foods are acceptable, but it is wrong to eat something if it makes another person stumble."
Romans,14,21,It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything else if it might cause another believer to stumble.
Romans,14,22,"You may believe there’s nothing wrong with what you are doing, but keep it between yourself and God. Blessed are those who don’t feel guilty for doing something they have decided is right."
Romans,14,23,"But if you have doubts about whether or not you should eat something, you are sinning if you go ahead and do it. For you are not following your convictions. If you do anything you believe is not right, you are sinning."
Romans,15,1,We who are strong must be considerate of those who are sensitive about things like this. We must not just please ourselves.
Romans,15,2,We should help others do what is right and build them up in the Lord.
Romans,15,3,"For even Christ didn’t live to please himself. As the Scriptures say, “The insults of those who insult you, O God, have fallen on me.”"
Romans,15,4,Such things were written in the Scriptures long ago to teach us. And the Scriptures give us hope and encouragement as we wait patiently for God’s promises to be fulfilled.
Romans,15,5,"May God, who gives this patience and encouragement, help you live in complete harmony with each other, as is fitting for followers of Christ Jesus."
Romans,15,6,"Then all of you can join together with one voice, giving praise and glory to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ."
Romans,15,7,"Therefore, accept each other just as Christ has accepted you so that God will be given glory."
Romans,15,8,Remember that Christ came as a servant to the Jews to show that God is true to the promises he made to their ancestors.
Romans,15,9,"He also came so that the Gentiles might give glory to God for his mercies to them. That is what the psalmist meant when he wrote: “For this, I will praise you among the Gentiles; I will sing praises to your name.”"
Romans,15,10,"And in another place it is written, “Rejoice with his people, you Gentiles.”"
Romans,15,11,"And yet again, “Praise the Lord , all you Gentiles. Praise him, all you people of the earth.”"
Romans,15,12,"And in another place Isaiah said, “The heir to David’s throne will come, and he will rule over the Gentiles. They will place their hope on him.”"
Romans,15,13,"I pray that God, the source of hope, will fill you completely with joy and peace because you trust in him. Then you will overflow with confident hope through the power of the Holy Spirit."
Romans,15,14,"I am fully convinced, my dear brothers and sisters, that you are full of goodness. You know these things so well you can teach each other all about them."
Romans,15,15,"Even so, I have been bold enough to write about some of these points, knowing that all you need is this reminder. For by God’s grace,"
Romans,15,16,"I am a special messenger from Christ Jesus to you Gentiles. I bring you the Good News so that I might present you as an acceptable offering to God, made holy by the Holy Spirit."
Romans,15,17,So I have reason to be enthusiastic about all Christ Jesus has done through me in my service to God.
Romans,15,18,"Yet I dare not boast about anything except what Christ has done through me, bringing the Gentiles to God by my message and by the way I worked among them."
Romans,15,19,"They were convinced by the power of miraculous signs and wonders and by the power of God’s Spirit. In this way, I have fully presented the Good News of Christ from Jerusalem all the way to Illyricum."
Romans,15,20,"My ambition has always been to preach the Good News where the name of Christ has never been heard, rather than where a church has already been started by someone else."
Romans,15,21,"I have been following the plan spoken of in the Scriptures, where it says, “Those who have never been told about him will see, and those who have never heard of him will understand.”"
Romans,15,22,"In fact, my visit to you has been delayed so long because I have been preaching in these places."
Romans,15,23,"But now I have finished my work in these regions, and after all these long years of waiting, I am eager to visit you."
Romans,15,24,"I am planning to go to Spain, and when I do, I will stop off in Rome. And after I have enjoyed your fellowship for a little while, you can provide for my journey."
Romans,15,25,"But before I come, I must go to Jerusalem to take a gift to the believers there."
Romans,15,26,"For you see, the believers in Macedonia and Achaia have eagerly taken up an offering for the poor among the believers in Jerusalem."
Romans,15,27,"They were glad to do this because they feel they owe a real debt to them. Since the Gentiles received the spiritual blessings of the Good News from the believers in Jerusalem, they feel the least they can do in return is to help them financially."
Romans,15,28,"As soon as I have delivered this money and completed this good deed of theirs, I will come to see you on my way to Spain."
Romans,15,29,"And I am sure that when I come, Christ will richly bless our time together."
Romans,15,30,"Dear brothers and sisters, I urge you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to join in my struggle by praying to God for me. Do this because of your love for me, given to you by the Holy Spirit."
Romans,15,31,Pray that I will be rescued from those in Judea who refuse to obey God. Pray also that the believers there will be willing to accept the donation I am taking to Jerusalem.
Romans,15,32,"Then, by the will of God, I will be able to come to you with a joyful heart, and we will be an encouragement to each other."
Romans,15,33,"And now may God, who gives us his peace, be with you all. Amen."
Romans,16,1,"I commend to you our sister Phoebe, who is a deacon in the church in Cenchrea."
Romans,16,2,"Welcome her in the Lord as one who is worthy of honor among God’s people. Help her in whatever she needs, for she has been helpful to many, and especially to me."
Romans,16,3,"Give my greetings to Priscilla and Aquila, my co-workers in the ministry of Christ Jesus."
