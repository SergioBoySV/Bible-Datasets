Song of Songs,1,1,"This is Solomon's
most beautiful song."
Song of Songs,1,2,"Kiss me tenderly!
Your love is better than wine"
Song of Songs,1,3,"and you smell so sweet.
All the young women adore you;
the very mention of your name
is like spreading perfume.
*"
Song of Songs,1,4,"Hurry, my king! Let's hurry.
Take me to your home.
We are happy for you!
And we praise your love
even more than wine.
Young women of Jerusalem,
it is only right
that you should adore him."
Song of Songs,1,5,"My skin is dark and beautiful,
like a tent in the desert
or like Solomon's curtains."
Song of Songs,1,6,"Don't stare at me
just because the sun
has darkened my skin.
My brothers were angry with me;
they made me work in the vineyard,
and so I neglected
my complexion."
Song of Songs,1,7,"My darling, I love you!
Where do you feed your sheep
and let them rest at noon?
Don't let the other shepherds
think badly of me.
I'm not one of those women
who shamelessly follow
after shepherds."
Song of Songs,1,8,"My dearest, if you don't know,
just follow the path
of the sheep.
Then feed your young goats
near the shepherds' tents."
Song of Songs,1,9,"You move as gracefully
as the pony that leads
the chariot of the king."
Song of Songs,1,10,"Earrings add to your beauty,
and you wear a necklace
of precious stones."
Song of Songs,1,11,"Let's make you some jewelry
of gold, woven with silver."
Song of Songs,1,12,"My king, while you
were on your couch,
my aroma was a magic charm."
Song of Songs,1,13,"My darling, you are perfume
between my breasts"
Song of Songs,1,14,"you are flower blossoms
from the gardens of En-Gedi."
Song of Songs,1,15,"My darling, you are lovely,
so very lovely—
your eyes are those of a dove."
Song of Songs,1,16,"My love, you are handsome,
truly handsome—
the fresh green grass
will be our wedding bed"
Song of Songs,1,17,"in the shade of cedar
and cypress trees."
Song of Songs,2,1,"I am merely a rose
from the land of Sharon,
a lily from the valley."
Song of Songs,2,2,"My darling, when compared
with other young women,
you are a lily among thorns."
Song of Songs,2,3,"And you, my love,
are an apple tree
among trees of the forest.
Your shade brought me pleasure;
your fruit was sweet."
Song of Songs,2,4,"You led me to your banquet room
and showered me with love."
Song of Songs,2,5,"Refresh and strengthen me
with raisins and apples.
I am hungry for love!"
Song of Songs,2,6,"Put your left hand under my head
and embrace me
with your right arm."
Song of Songs,2,7,"Young women of Jerusalem,
promise me by the power
of deer and gazelles
never to awaken love
before it is ready."
Song of Songs,2,8,"I hear the voice
of the one I love,
as he comes leaping
over mountains and hills"
Song of Songs,2,9,"like a deer or a gazelle.
Now he stands outside our wall,
looking through the window"
Song of Songs,2,10,"and speaking to me.
My darling, I love you!
Let's go away together."
Song of Songs,2,11,"Winter is past,
the rain has stopped"
Song of Songs,2,12,"flowers cover the earth,
it's time to sing.
The cooing of doves
is heard in our land."
Song of Songs,2,13,"Fig trees are bearing fruit,
while blossoms on grapevines
fill the air with perfume.
My darling, I love you!
Let's go away together."
Song of Songs,2,14,"You are my dove
hiding among the rocks
on the side of a cliff.
Let me see how lovely you are!
Let me hear the sound
of your melodious voice."
Song of Songs,2,15,"Our vineyards are in blossom;
we must catch the little foxes
that destroy the vineyards."
Song of Songs,2,16,"My darling, I am yours,
and you are mine,
as you feed your sheep
among the lilies."
Song of Songs,2,17,"Pretend to be a young deer
dancing on mountain slopes
until daylight comes
and shadows fade away."
Song of Songs,3,1,"While in bed at night,
I reached for the one I love
with heart and soul.
I looked for him,
but he wasn't there."
Song of Songs,3,2,"So I searched through the town
for the one I love.
I looked on every street,
but he wasn't there."
Song of Songs,3,3,"I even asked the guards
patrolling the town,
“Have you seen the one
I love so much?”"
Song of Songs,3,4,"Right after that, I found him.
I held him and would not let go
until I had taken him
to the home of my mother."
Song of Songs,3,5,"Young women of Jerusalem,
promise me by the power
of deer and gazelles,
never to awaken love
before it is ready."
Song of Songs,3,6,"What do we see approaching
from the desert
like a cloud of smoke?
With it comes the sweet smell
of spices, including myrrh
and frankincense."
Song of Songs,3,7,"It is King Solomon
carried on a throne,
surrounded by sixty
of Israel's best soldiers."
Song of Songs,3,8,"Each of them wears a sword.
They are experts at fighting,
even in the dark."
Song of Songs,3,9,"The throne is made of trees
from Lebanon."
Song of Songs,3,10,"Its posts are silver,
the back is gold,
and the seat is covered
with purple cloth.
You women of Jerusalem
have taken great care
to furnish the inside."
Song of Songs,3,11,"Now come and see the crown
given to Solomon by his mother
on his happy wedding day."
Song of Songs,4,1,"My darling, you are lovely,
so very lovely—
as you look through your veil,
your eyes are those of a dove.
Your hair tosses about
as gracefully as goats
coming down from Gilead."
Song of Songs,4,2,"Your teeth are whiter
than sheep freshly washed;
they match perfectly,
not one is missing."
Song of Songs,4,3,"Your lips are crimson cords,
your mouth is shapely;
behind your veil are hidden
beautiful rosy cheeks."
Song of Songs,4,4,"Your neck is more graceful
than the tower of David,
decorated with thousands
of warriors' shields."
Song of Songs,4,5,"Your breasts are perfect;
they are twin deer
feeding among lilies."
Song of Songs,4,6,"I will hasten to those hills
sprinkled with sweet perfume
and stay there till sunrise."
Song of Songs,4,7,"My darling, you are lovely
in every way."
Song of Songs,4,8,"My bride, together
we will leave Lebanon!
We will say goodbye
to the peaks of Mount Amana,
Senir, and Hermon,
where lions and leopards
live in the caves."
Song of Songs,4,9,"My bride, my very own,
you have stolen my heart!
With one glance from your eyes
and the glow of your necklace,
you have stolen my heart."
Song of Songs,4,10,"Your love is sweeter than wine;
the smell of your perfume
is more fragrant than spices."
Song of Songs,4,11,"Your lips are a honeycomb;
milk and honey
flow from your tongue.
Your dress has the aroma
of cedar trees from Lebanon."
Song of Songs,4,12,"My bride, my very own,
you are a garden, a fountain
closed off to all others."
Song of Songs,4,13,"Your arms are vines,
covered with delicious fruits
and all sorts of spices—
henna, nard"
Song of Songs,4,14,"saffron,
calamus, cinnamon,
frankincense, myrrh, and aloes
—all the finest spices."
Song of Songs,4,15,"You are a spring in the garden,
a fountain of pure water,
and a refreshing stream
from Mount Lebanon."
Song of Songs,4,16,"Let the north wind blow,
the south wind too!
Let them spread the aroma
of my garden,
so the one I love
may enter and taste
its delicious fruits."
Song of Songs,5,1,"My bride, my very own,
I come to my garden
and enjoy its spices.
I eat my honeycomb and honey;
I drink my wine and milk.
Eat and drink until
you are drunk with love."
Song of Songs,5,2,"I was asleep, but dreaming:
The one I love was at the door,
knocking and saying,
“My darling, my very own,
my flawless dove,
open the door for me!
My head is drenched
with evening dew.”"
Song of Songs,5,3,"But I had already undressed
and bathed my feet.
Should I dress again
and get my feet dirty?"
Song of Songs,5,4,"Then my darling's hand
reached to open the latch,
and my heart stood still."
Song of Songs,5,5,"When I rose to open the door,
my hands and my fingers
dripped with perfume."
Song of Songs,5,6,"And I yearned for him
while he spoke to me,
but when I opened the door,
my darling had disappeared.
I searched and shouted,
but I could not find him—
there was no answer."
Song of Songs,5,7,"Then I was found by the guards
patrolling the town
and guarding the wall.
They beat me up
and stripped off my robe."
Song of Songs,5,8,"Young women of Jerusalem,
if you find the one I love,
please say to him,
“She is weak with desire.”"
Song of Songs,5,9,"Most beautiful of women,
why is the one you love
more special than others?
Why do you ask us
to tell him how you feel?"
Song of Songs,5,10,"He is handsome and healthy,
the most outstanding
among ten thousand."
Song of Songs,5,11,"His head is purest gold;
his hair is wavy,
black as a raven."
Song of Songs,5,12,"His eyes are a pair of doves
bathing in a stream
flowing with milk."
Song of Songs,5,13,"His face is a garden
of sweet-smelling spices;
his lips are lilies
dripping with perfume."
Song of Songs,5,14,"His arms are branches of gold
covered with jewels;
his body is ivory
decorated with sapphires."
Song of Songs,5,15,"His legs are columns of marble
on feet of gold.
He stands there majestic
like Mount Lebanon
and its choice cedar trees."
Song of Songs,5,16,"His kisses are sweet.
I desire him so much!
Young women of Jerusalem,
he is my lover and friend."
Song of Songs,6,1,"Most beautiful of women,
tell us where he has gone.
Let us help you find him."
Song of Songs,6,2,"My darling has gone down
to his garden of spices,
where he will feed his sheep
and gather lilies."
Song of Songs,6,3,"I am his, and he is mine,
as he feeds his sheep
among the lilies."
Song of Songs,6,4,"My dearest, the cities of Tirzah
and Jerusalem
are not as lovely as you.
Your charms are more powerful
than all of the stars
in the heavens."
Song of Songs,6,5,"Turn away your eyes—
they make me melt.
Your hair tosses about
as gracefully as goats
coming down from Gilead."
Song of Songs,6,6,"Your teeth are whiter
than sheep freshly washed;
they match perfectly,
not one is missing."
Song of Songs,6,7,"Behind your veil are hidden
beautiful rosy cheeks."
Song of Songs,6,8,"What if I could have
sixty queens, eighty wives,
and thousands of others!"
Song of Songs,6,9,"You would be my only choice,
my flawless dove,
the favorite child
of your mother.
The young women, the queens,
and all the others
tell how excited you are
as they sing your praises"
Song of Songs,6,10,"“You are as majestic
as the morning sky—
glorious as the moon—
blinding as the sun!
Your charms are more powerful
than all the stars above.”"
Song of Songs,6,11,"I went down to see if blossoms
were on the walnut trees,
grapevines, and fruit trees."
Song of Songs,6,12,"But in my imagination
I was suddenly riding
on a glorious chariot."
Song of Songs,6,13,"Dance! Dance!
Beautiful woman from Shulam,
let us see you dance!
Why do you want to see
this woman from Shulam
dancing with the others?"
Song of Songs,7,1,"You are a princess,
and your feet are graceful
in their sandals.
Your thighs are works of art,
each one a jewel"
Song of Songs,7,2,"your navel is a wine glass
filled to overflowing.
Your body is full and slender
like a bundle of wheat
bound together by lilies."
Song of Songs,7,3,"Your breasts are like twins
of a deer."
Song of Songs,7,4,"Your neck is like ivory,
and your eyes sparkle
like the pools of Heshbon
by the gate of Bath-Rabbim.
Your nose is beautiful
like Mount Lebanon
above the city of Damascus."
Song of Songs,7,5,"Your head is held high
like Mount Carmel;
your hair is so lovely
it holds a king prisoner."
Song of Songs,7,6,"You are very beautiful,
so desirable!"
Song of Songs,7,7,"You are tall and slender
like a palm tree,
and your breasts are full."
Song of Songs,7,8,"I will climb that tree
and cling to its branches.
I will discover that your breasts
are clusters of grapes,
and that your breath
is the aroma of apples."
Song of Songs,7,9,"Kissing you is more delicious
than drinking the finest wine.
How wonderful and tasty!"
Song of Songs,7,10,"My darling, I am yours,
and you desire me."
Song of Songs,7,11,"Let's stroll through the fields
and sleep in the villages."
Song of Songs,7,12,"At dawn let's slip out and see
if grapevines and fruit trees
are covered with blossoms.
When we are there,
I will give you my love."
Song of Songs,7,13,"Perfume from the magic flower
fills the air, my darling.
Right at our doorstep
I have stored up for you
all kinds of tasty fruits."
Song of Songs,8,1,"If you were my brother,
I could kiss you
whenever we happen to meet,
and no one would say
I did wrong."
Song of Songs,8,2,"I could take you to the home
of my mother,
who taught me all I know.
I would give you delicious wine
and fruit juice as well."
Song of Songs,8,3,"Put your left hand under my head
and embrace me
with your right arm."
Song of Songs,8,4,"Young women of Jerusalem,
promise me never to awaken love
before it is ready."
Song of Songs,8,5,"Who is this young woman
coming in from the desert
and leaning on the shoulder
of the one she loves?
I stirred up your passions
under the apple tree
where you were born."
Song of Songs,8,6,"Always keep me in your heart
and wear this bracelet
to remember me by.
The passion of love
bursting into flame
is more powerful than death,
stronger than the grave."
Song of Songs,8,7,"Love cannot be drowned
by oceans or floods.
It cannot be bought—
any offer would be scorned
no matter how great."
Song of Songs,8,8,"We have a little sister
whose breasts
are not yet formed.
If someone asks to marry her,
what should we do?"
Song of Songs,8,9,"She isn't a wall
that we can defend
behind a silver shield.
Neither is she a room
that we can protect
behind a wooden door."
Song of Songs,8,10,"I am a wall around a city,
my breasts are towers,
and just looking at me
brings him great pleasure."
Song of Songs,8,11,"Solomon has a vineyard
at Baal-Hamon,
which he rents to others
for a thousand pieces
of silver each."
Song of Songs,8,12,"My vineyard is mine alone!
Solomon can keep his silver
and the others can keep
their share of the profits."
Song of Songs,8,13,"You are in the garden
with friends all around.
Let me hear your voice!"
Song of Songs,8,14,"Hurry to me, my darling!
Run faster than a deer
to mountains of spices."
