Nehemiah,1,1,"I am Nehemiah son of Hacaliah, and in this book I tell what I have done.
During the month of Chislev in the twentieth year that Artaxerxes ruled Persia, I was in his fortress city of Susa"
Nehemiah,1,2,when my brother Hanani came with some men from Judah. So I asked them about the Jews who had escaped from being captives in Babylonia. I also asked them about the city of Jerusalem.
Nehemiah,1,3,"They told me, “Those captives who have come back are having all kinds of troubles. They are terribly disgraced, Jerusalem's walls are broken down, and its gates have been burned.”"
Nehemiah,1,4,"When I heard this, I sat down on the ground and cried. Then for several days, I mourned; I went without eating to show my sorrow, and I prayed"
Nehemiah,1,5,"LORD God of heaven, you are great and fearsome. And you faithfully keep your promises to everyone who loves you and obeys your commands."
Nehemiah,1,6,"I am your servant, so please have mercy on me and answer the prayer that I make day and night for these people of Israel who serve you. I, my family, and the rest of your people have sinned"
Nehemiah,1,7,by choosing to disobey you and the laws and teachings you gave to your servant Moses.
Nehemiah,1,8,"Please remember the promise you made to Moses. You told him that if we were unfaithful, you would scatter us among foreign nations."
Nehemiah,1,9,"But you also said that no matter how far away we were, we could turn to you and start obeying your laws. Then you would bring us back to the place where you have chosen to be worshiped."
Nehemiah,1,10,"Our LORD, I am praying for your servants—those you rescued by your great strength and mighty power."
Nehemiah,1,11,"Please answer my prayer and the prayer of your other servants who gladly honor your name. When I serve the king his wine today, make him pleased with me and let him do what I ask."
Nehemiah,2,1,"During the month of Nisan in the twentieth year that Artaxerxes was king, I served him his wine, as I had done before. But this was the first time I had ever looked depressed."
Nehemiah,2,2,"So the king said, “Why do you look so sad? You're not sick. Something must be bothering you.”
Even though I was frightened"
Nehemiah,2,3,"I answered, “Your Majesty, I hope you live forever! I feel sad because the city where my ancestors are buried is in ruins, and its gates have been burned down.”"
Nehemiah,2,4,"The king asked, “What do you want me to do?”
I prayed to the God who rules from heaven."
Nehemiah,2,5,"Then I told the king, “Sir, if it's all right with you, please send me back to Judah, so that I can rebuild the city where my ancestors are buried.”"
Nehemiah,2,6,"The queen was sitting beside the king when he asked me, “How long will it take, and when will you be back?” The king agreed to let me go, and I told him when I would return."
Nehemiah,2,7,"Then I asked, “Your Majesty, would you be willing to give me letters to the governors of the provinces west of the Euphrates River, so that I can travel safely to Judah?"
Nehemiah,2,8,"I will need timber to rebuild the gates of the fortress near the temple and more timber to construct the city wall and to build a place for me to live. And so, I would appreciate a letter to Asaph, who is in charge of the royal forest.” God was good to me, and the king did everything I asked."
Nehemiah,2,9,"The king sent some army officers and cavalry troops along with me, and as I traveled through the Western Provinces, I gave the letters to the governors."
Nehemiah,2,10,"But when Sanballat from Horon and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about what had happened, they became very angry, because they didn't want anyone to help the people of Israel."
Nehemiah,2,11,Three days after arriving in Jerusalem
Nehemiah,2,12,"I got up during the night and left my house. I took some men with me, without telling anyone what I thought God wanted me to do for the city. The only animal I took was the donkey I rode on."
Nehemiah,2,13,"I went through Valley Gate on the west, then south past Dragon Spring, before coming to Garbage Gate. As I rode along, I took a good look at the crumbled walls of the city and the gates that had been torn down and burned."
Nehemiah,2,14,"On the east side of the city, I headed north to Fountain Gate and King's Pool, but then the trail became too narrow for my donkey."
Nehemiah,2,15,So I went down to Kidron Valley and looked at the wall from there. Then before daylight I returned to the city through Valley Gate.
Nehemiah,2,16,"None of the city officials knew what I had in mind. And I had not even told any of the Jews—not the priests, the leaders, the officials, or any other Jews who would be helping in the work."
Nehemiah,2,17,"But when I got back, I said to them, “Jerusalem is truly in a mess! The gates have been torn down and burned, and everything is in ruins. We must rebuild the city wall so that we can again take pride in our city.”"
Nehemiah,2,18,"Then I told them how kind God had been and what the king had said.
Immediately, they replied, “Let's start building now!” So they got everything ready."
Nehemiah,2,19,"When Sanballat, Tobiah, and Geshem the Arab heard about our plans, they started insulting us and saying, “Just look at you! Do you plan to rebuild the walls of the city and rebel against the king?”"
Nehemiah,2,20,"I answered, “We are servants of the God who rules from heaven, and he will make our work succeed. So we will start rebuilding Jerusalem, but you have no right to any of its property, because you have had no part in its history.”"
Nehemiah,3,1,"These are the people who helped rebuild the wall and gates of Jerusalem:
The high priest Eliashib and the other priests rebuilt Sheep Gate and hung its doors. Then they dedicated Sheep Gate and the section of the wall as far as Hundred Tower and Hananel Tower."
Nehemiah,3,2,"The people of Jericho rebuilt the next section of the wall, and Zaccur son of Imri rebuilt the section after that."
Nehemiah,3,3,"The family of Hassenaah built Fish Gate. They put the beams in place and hung the doors, then they added metal bolts and wooden beams as locks."

Nehemiah,3,15,"Shallum son of Colhozeh ruled the district of Mizpah, and he rebuilt Fountain Gate. He put a cover over the gateway, then hung the doors and added metal bolts and wooden beams as locks. He also rebuilt the wall at Shelah Pool. This section was next to the king's garden and went as far as the stairs leading down from David's City."
Nehemiah,3,16,"Nehemiah son of Azbuk ruled half of the district of Beth-Zur, and he rebuilt the next section of the wall. It went as far as the royal cemetery, the artificial pool, and the army barracks."
Nehemiah,3,17,"The Levites who worked on the next sections of the wall were Rehum son of Bani; Hashabiah, who ruled half of the district of Keilah and did this work for his district"
Nehemiah,3,18,"Binnui son of Henadad, who ruled the other half of the district of Keilah"
Nehemiah,3,19,"Ezer son of Jeshua, who ruled Mizpah, rebuilt the section of the wall that was in front of the armory and reached to the corner of the wall"
Nehemiah,3,20,Baruch son of Zabbai eagerly rebuilt the section of the wall that went all the way to the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest
Nehemiah,3,21,"Meremoth, son of Uriah and grandson of Hakkoz, built up to the far end of Eliashib's house."
Nehemiah,3,22,"Here is a list of the priests who worked on the wall:
Priests from the region around Jerusalem rebuilt the next section of the wall."
Nehemiah,3,23,"Benjamin and Hasshub rebuilt the wall in front of their own houses.
Azariah, who was the son of Maaseiah and the grandson of Ananiah, rebuilt the section in front of his house."
Nehemiah,3,24,Binnui son of Henadad rebuilt the section of the wall from Azariah's house to the corner of the wall.
Nehemiah,3,25,"Palal son of Uzai rebuilt the next section, which began at the corner of the wall and the tower of the upper palace near the court of the guard.
Pedaiah son of Parosh rebuilt the next section of the wall."
Nehemiah,3,26,"He stopped at a place near the Water Gate on the east and the tower guarding the temple. This was close to a section in the city called Ophel, where the temple workers lived."
Nehemiah,3,27,"The men from Tekoa rebuilt the next section of the wall, and it was their second section. It started at a place across from the large tower that guarded the Temple, and it went all the way to the wall near Ophel."
Nehemiah,3,28,"Some priests rebuilt the next section of the wall. They began working north of Horse Gate, and each one worked on a section in front of his own house."
Nehemiah,3,29,"Zadok son of Immer rebuilt the wall in front of his house.

Nehemiah,3,30,"Hananiah and Hanun rebuilt the next section, which was the second section for them.
Meshullam son of Berechiah rebuilt the next section, which happened to be in front of his house."
Nehemiah,3,31,"Malchijah, a goldsmith, rebuilt the next section, as far as the house used by the temple workers and merchants. This area was across from Gathering Gate, near the room on top of the wall at the northeast corner."
Nehemiah,3,32,"The goldsmiths and merchants rebuilt the last section of the wall, which went from the corner room all the way to Sheep Gate."
Nehemiah,4,1,"When Sanballat, the governor of Samaria, heard that we were rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem, he became angry and started insulting our people."
Nehemiah,4,2,"In front of his friends and the Samaritan army he said, “What is this feeble bunch of Jews trying to do? Are they going to rebuild the wall and offer sacrifices all in one day? Do they think they can make something out of this pile of scorched stones?”"
Nehemiah,4,3,"Tobiah from Ammon was standing beside Sanballat and said, “Look at the wall they are building! Why, even a fox could knock over this pile of stones.”"
Nehemiah,4,4,"But I prayed, “Our God, these people hate us and have wished horrible things for us. Please answer our prayers and make their insults fall on them! Let them be the ones to be dragged away as prisoners of war."
Nehemiah,4,5,Don't forgive the mean and evil way they have insulted the builders.”
Nehemiah,4,6,"The people worked hard, and we built the walls of Jerusalem halfway up again."
Nehemiah,4,7,"But Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the people from the city of Ashdod saw the walls going up and the holes being repaired. So they became angry"
Nehemiah,4,8,"and decided to stir up trouble, and to fight against the people of Jerusalem."
Nehemiah,4,9,"But we kept on praying to our God, and we also stationed guards day and night."
Nehemiah,4,10,"Meanwhile, the people of Judah were singing a sorrowful song:
“So much rubble for us to haul!
Worn out and weary,
will we ever finish this wall?”"
Nehemiah,4,11,"Our enemies were saying, “Before those Jews know what has happened, we will sneak up and kill them and put an end to their work.”"
Nehemiah,4,12,"On at least ten different occasions, the Jews living near our enemies warned us against attacks from every side"
Nehemiah,4,13,"and so I sent people to guard the wall at its lowest places and where there were still holes in it. I placed them according to families, and they stood guard with swords and spears and with bows and arrows."
Nehemiah,4,14,"Then I looked things over and told the leaders, the officials, and the rest of the people, “Don't be afraid of your enemies! The Lord is great and fearsome. So think of him and fight for your relatives and children, your wives and homes!”"
Nehemiah,4,15,"Our enemies found out that we knew about their plot against us, but God kept them from doing what they had planned. So we went back to work on the wall."
Nehemiah,4,16,"From then on, I let half of the young men work while the other half stood guard. They wore armor and had spears and shields, as well as bows and arrows. The leaders helped the workers"
Nehemiah,4,17,who were rebuilding the wall. Everyone who hauled building materials kept one hand free to carry a weapon.
Nehemiah,4,18,Even the workers who were rebuilding the wall strapped on a sword. The worker who was to blow the signal trumpet stayed with me.
Nehemiah,4,19,"I told the people and their officials and leaders, “Our work is so spread out, that we are a long way from one another."
Nehemiah,4,20,"If you hear the sound of the trumpet, come quickly and gather around me. Our God will help us fight.”"
Nehemiah,4,21,"Every day from dawn to dark, half of the workers rebuilt the walls, while the rest stood guard with their spears."
Nehemiah,4,22,I asked the men in charge and their workers to stay inside Jerusalem and stand guard at night. So they guarded the city at night and worked during the day.
Nehemiah,4,23,"I even slept in my work clothes at night; my relatives, the workers, and the guards slept in theirs as well. And we always kept our weapons close by."
Nehemiah,5,1,Some of the men and their wives complained about the Jews in power
Nehemiah,5,2,"and said, “We have large families, and it takes a lot of grain merely to keep us alive.”"
Nehemiah,5,3,"Others said, “During the famine we even had to mortgage our fields, vineyards, and homes to them in order to buy grain.”"
Nehemiah,5,4,"Then others said, “We had to borrow money from those in power to pay the government tax on our fields and vineyards."
Nehemiah,5,5,"We are Jews just as they are, and our children are as good as theirs. But we still have to sell our children as slaves, and some of our daughters have already been raped. We are completely helpless; our fields and vineyards have even been taken from us.”"
Nehemiah,5,6,"When I heard their complaints and their charges, I became very angry."
Nehemiah,5,7,"So I thought it over and said to the leaders and officials, “How can you charge your own people interest?”
Then I called a public meeting and accused the leaders"
Nehemiah,5,8,"by saying, “We have tried to buy back all of our people who were sold into exile. But here you are, selling more of them for us to buy back!” The officials and leaders did not say a word, because they knew this was true."
Nehemiah,5,9,"I continued, “What you have done is wrong! We must honor our God by the way we live, so the Gentiles can't find fault with us."
Nehemiah,5,10,"My relatives, my friends, and I are also lending money and grain, but we must no longer demand payment in return."
Nehemiah,5,11,"Now give back the fields, vineyards, olive orchards, and houses you have taken and also the interest you have been paid.”"
Nehemiah,5,12,"The leaders answered, “We will do whatever you say and return their property, without asking to be repaid.”
So I made the leaders promise in front of the priests to give back the property."
Nehemiah,5,13,"Then I emptied my pockets and said, “If you don't keep your promise, that's what God will do to you. He will empty out everything you own, even taking away your houses.”
The people answered, “We will keep our promise.” Then they praised the LORD and did as they had promised."
Nehemiah,5,14,"I was governor of Judah from the twentieth year that Artaxerxes was king until the thirty-second year. And during these entire twelve years, my relatives and I refused to accept the food that I was allowed."
Nehemiah,5,15,"Each governor before me had been a burden to the people by making them pay for his food and wine and by demanding forty silver coins a day. Even their officials had been a burden to the people. But I respected God, and I didn't think it was right to be so hard on them."
Nehemiah,5,16,I spent all my time getting the wall rebuilt and did not buy any property. Everyone working for me did the same thing.
Nehemiah,5,17,"I usually fed 150 of our own Jewish people and their leaders, as well as foreign visitors from surrounding lands."
Nehemiah,5,18,"Each day one ox, six of the best sheep, and lots of chickens were prepared. Then every ten days, a large supply of wine was brought in. I knew what a heavy burden this would have been for the people, and so I did not ask for my food allowance as governor."
Nehemiah,5,19,I pray that God will bless me for everything I have done for my people.
Nehemiah,6,1,"Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem, and our other enemies learned that I had completely rebuilt the wall. All I lacked was hanging the doors in the gates."
Nehemiah,6,2,"Then Sanballat and Geshem sent a message, asking me to meet with them in one of the villages in Ono Valley. I knew they were planning to harm me in some way."
Nehemiah,6,3,"So I sent messengers to tell them, “My work is too important to stop now and go there. I can't afford to slow down the work just to visit with you.”"
Nehemiah,6,4,"They invited me four times, but each time I refused to go."
Nehemiah,6,5,"Finally, Sanballat sent an official to me with an unsealed letter"
Nehemiah,6,6,"which said:
A rumor is going around among the nations that you and the other Jews are rebuilding the wall and planning to rebel, because you want to be their king. And Geshem says it's true!"
Nehemiah,6,7,"You even have prophets in Jerusalem, claiming you are now the king of Judah. You know the Persian king will hear about this, so let's get together and talk it over."
Nehemiah,6,8,"I sent a message back to Sanballat, saying, “None of this is true! You are making it all up.”"
Nehemiah,6,9,Our enemies were trying to frighten us and to keep us from our work. But I asked God to give me strength.
Nehemiah,6,10,"One day I went to visit Shemaiah. He wasn't supposed to leave his house, but he said, “Let's hurry to the holy place of the temple and hide there. We will lock the temple doors, because your enemies are planning to kill you tonight.”"
Nehemiah,6,11,"I answered, “Why should someone like me have to run and hide in the temple to save my life? I won't go!”"
Nehemiah,6,12,Suddenly I realized that God had not given Shemaiah this message. But Tobiah and Sanballat had paid him to trick me
Nehemiah,6,13,"and to frighten me into doing something wrong, because they wanted to ruin my good name."
Nehemiah,6,14,"Then I asked God to punish Tobiah and Sanballat for what they had done. I prayed that God would punish the prophet Noadiah and the other prophets who, together with her, had tried to frighten me."
Nehemiah,6,15,"On the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul, the wall was completely rebuilt. It had taken 52 days."
Nehemiah,6,16,"When our enemies in the surrounding nations learned that the work was finished, they felt helpless, because they knew that our God had helped us rebuild the wall."
Nehemiah,6,17,All this time the Jewish leaders and Tobiah had been writing letters back and forth.
Nehemiah,6,18,"Many people in Judah were loyal to Tobiah for two reasons: Shecaniah son of Arah was his father-in-law, and Tobiah's son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berechiah."
Nehemiah,6,19,"The people would always tell me about the good things Tobiah had done, and then they would tell Tobiah everything I had said. So Tobiah kept sending letters, trying to frighten me."
Nehemiah,7,1,"After the wall had been rebuilt and the gates hung, then the temple guards, the singers, and the other Levites were assigned their work."
Nehemiah,7,2,"I put my brother Hanani in charge of Jerusalem, along with Hananiah, the commander of the fortress, because Hananiah could be trusted, and he respected God more than most people did."
Nehemiah,7,3,"I said to them, “Don't let the gates to the city be opened until the sun has been up for a while. And make sure that they are closed and barred before the guards go off duty at sunset. Choose people from Jerusalem to stand guard at different places around the wall and others to stand guard near their own houses.”"
Nehemiah,7,4,"Although Jerusalem covered a large area, not many people lived there, and no new houses had been built."
Nehemiah,7,5,"So God gave me the idea to bring together the people, their leaders, and officials and to check the family records of those who had returned from captivity in Babylonia, after having been taken there by King Nebuchadnezzar. About this same time, I found records of those who had been the first to return to Jerusalem from Babylon Province. By reading these records, I learned that they settled in their own hometowns"
Nehemiah,7,6,"So God gave me the idea to bring together the people, their leaders, and officials and to check the family records of those who had returned from captivity in Babylonia, after having been taken there by King Nebuchadnezzar. About this same time, I found records of those who had been the first to return to Jerusalem from Babylon Province. By reading these records, I learned that they settled in their own hometowns"
Nehemiah,7,7,"and that they had come with Zerubbabel, Joshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, and Baanah."

Nehemiah,8,16,"So the people gathered branches and made shelters on the flat roofs of their houses, in their yards, in the courtyard of the temple, and in the open areas around the Water Gate and Ephraim Gate."
Nehemiah,8,17,Everyone who had returned from Babylonia built shelters. They lived in them and joyfully celebrated the Festival of Shelters for the first time since the days of Joshua son of Nun.
Nehemiah,8,18,"On each of the first seven days of the festival, Ezra read to the people from God's Law. Then on the eighth day, everyone gathered for worship, just as the Law had said they must."
Nehemiah,9,1,"On the twenty-fourth day of the seventh month, the people of Israel went without eating, and they dressed in sackcloth and threw dirt on their heads to show their sorrow."
Nehemiah,9,2,"They refused to let foreigners join them, as they met to confess their sins and the sins of their ancestors."
Nehemiah,9,3,"For three hours they stood and listened to the Law of the LORD their God, and then for the next three hours they confessed their sins and worshiped the LORD."
Nehemiah,9,4,"Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani stood on the special platform for the Levites and prayed aloud to the LORD their God."
Nehemiah,9,5,"Then the Levites Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah said:
“Stand and shout praises
to your LORD,
the eternal God!
Praise his wonderful name,
though he is greater
than words can express.”"
Nehemiah,9,6,"You alone are the LORD,
Creator of the heavens
and all the stars,
Creator of the earth
and those who live on it,
Creator of the ocean
and all its creatures.
You are the source of life,
praised by the stars
that fill the heavens."
Nehemiah,9,7,"You are the LORD our God,
the one who chose Abram—
you brought him from Ur
in Babylonia
and named him Abraham."
Nehemiah,9,8,"Because he was faithful,
you made an agreement
to give his descendants
the land of the Canaanites
and Hittites,
of the Amorites and Perizzites,
and of the Jebusites
and Girgashites.
Now you have kept your promise,
just as you always do."
Nehemiah,9,9,"When our ancestors
were in Egypt,
you saw their suffering;
when they were at the Red Sea,
you heard their cry for help."
Nehemiah,9,10,"You knew that the King of Egypt
and his officials and his nation
had mistreated your people.
So you worked fearsome miracles
against the Egyptians
and earned a reputation
that still remains."
Nehemiah,9,11,"You divided the deep sea,
and your people walked through
on dry land.
But you tossed their enemies in,
and they sank down
like a heavy stone."
Nehemiah,9,12,"Each day you led your people
with a thick cloud,
and at night you showed the way
with a flaming fire."
Nehemiah,9,13,"At Sinai you came down
from heaven,
and you gave your people
good laws and teachings
that are fair and honest."
Nehemiah,9,14,"You commanded them to respect
your holy Sabbath,
and you instructed
your servant Moses
to teach them your laws."
Nehemiah,9,15,"When they were hungry,
you sent bread from heaven,
and when they were thirsty,
you let water flow
from a rock.
Then you commanded them
to capture the land
that you had solemnly promised.
*"
Nehemiah,9,16,"Our stubborn ancestors
refused to obey—
they forgot about the miracles
you had worked for them,
and they were determined
to return to Egypt
and become slaves again."
Nehemiah,9,17,"But, our God, you are merciful
and quick to forgive;
you are loving, kind,
and very patient.
So you never turned away
from them"
Nehemiah,9,18,"not even when they made
an idol shaped like a calf
and insulted you by claiming,
“This is the god who rescued us
from Egypt.”"
Nehemiah,9,19,"Because of your great mercy,
you never abandoned them
in the desert.
And you always guided them
with a cloud by day
and a fire at night."
Nehemiah,9,20,"Your gentle Spirit
instructed them,
and you gave them manna to eat
and water to drink."
Nehemiah,9,21,"You took good care of them,
and for forty years
they never lacked a thing.
Their clothes didn't wear out,
and their feet were never swollen."
Nehemiah,9,22,"You let them conquer kings
and take their land,
including King Sihon of Heshbon
and King Og of Bashan."
Nehemiah,9,23,"You brought them into the land
that you had promised
their ancestors,
and you blessed their nation
with people that outnumbered
the stars in the sky."
Nehemiah,9,24,"Then their descendants
conquered the land.
You helped them defeat
the kings and nations
and treat their enemies
however they wished."
Nehemiah,9,25,"They captured strong cities
and rich farmland;
they took furnished houses,
as well as cisterns,
vineyards, olive orchards,
and numerous fruit trees.
They ate till they were satisfied,
and they celebrated
your abundant blessings."
Nehemiah,9,26,"In spite of this, they rebelled
and disobeyed your laws.
They killed your prophets,
who warned them
to turn back to you,
and they cursed your name."
Nehemiah,9,27,"So you handed them over
to their enemies,
who treated them terribly.
But in their sufferings,
they begged you to help.
From heaven you listened
to their prayers
and because of your great mercy,
you sent leaders to rescue them."
Nehemiah,9,28,"But when they were at peace,
they would turn against you,
and you would hand them over
to their enemies.
Then they would beg for help,
and because you are merciful,
you rescued them
over and over again."
Nehemiah,9,29,"You warned them to turn back
and discover true life
by obeying your laws.
But they stubbornly refused
and continued to sin."
Nehemiah,9,30,"For years, you were patient,
and your Spirit warned them
with messages spoken
by your prophets.
Still they refused to listen,
and you handed them over
to their enemies."
Nehemiah,9,31,"But you are merciful and kind,
and so you never forgot them
or let them be destroyed."
Nehemiah,9,32,"Our God, you are powerful,
fearsome, and faithful,
always true to your word.
So please keep in mind
the terrible sufferings
of our people, kings, leaders,
priests, and prophets,
from the time Assyria ruled
until this very day."
Nehemiah,9,33,"You have always been fair
when you punished us
for our sins."
Nehemiah,9,34,"Our kings and leaders,
our priests and ancestors
have never obeyed your commands
or heeded your warnings."
Nehemiah,9,35,"You blessed them with a kingdom
and with an abundance
of rich, fertile land,
but they refused to worship you
or turn from their evil."
Nehemiah,9,36,"Now we are slaves
in this fruitful land
you gave to our ancestors."
Nehemiah,9,37,"Its plentiful harvest is taken
by kings you placed over us
because of our sins.
Our suffering is unbearable,
because they do as they wish
to us and our livestock."

Nehemiah,12,44,"On that same day, some leaders were appointed to be responsible for the safekeeping of gifts for the temple and to be in charge of receiving the first part of the harvest and the ten percent of the crops and livestock that was offered to God. These same leaders also collected the part of crops that the Law of Moses taught was to be given to the Levites.
Everyone was pleased with the work of the priests and Levites"
Nehemiah,12,45,when they performed the ceremonies to make people acceptable to worship God. And the singers and the temple guards did their jobs according to the instructions given by David and his son Solomon.
Nehemiah,12,46,"In fact, ever since the days of David and Asaph, there had been song leaders and songs of praise and worship."
Nehemiah,12,47,"During the time that Zerubbabel and I were in charge, everyone in Israel gave what they were supposed to give for the daily needs of the singers and temple guards from the Levi tribe. Then the Levites would give the priests their share from what they had received."
Nehemiah,13,1,"On that day when the Law of Moses was read aloud to everyone, it was discovered that Ammonites and Moabites were forbidden to belong to the people of God."
Nehemiah,13,2,"This was because they had refused to give food and water to Israel and had hired Balaam to call down a curse on them. However, our God turned the curse into a blessing."

Nehemiah,13,4,The priest Eliashib was a relative of Tobiah and had earlier been put in charge of the temple storerooms.
Nehemiah,13,5,"So he let Tobiah live in one of these rooms, where all kinds of things had been stored—the grain offerings, incense, utensils for the temple, as well as the tenth of the grain, wine, and olive oil that had been given for the use of the Levites, singers, and temple guards, and the gifts for the priests."
Nehemiah,13,6,"This happened in the thirty-second year that Artaxerxes ruled Babylonia. I was away from Jerusalem at the time, because I was visiting him. Later I received permission from the king"
Nehemiah,13,7,to return to Jerusalem. Only then did I find out that Eliashib had done this terrible thing of letting Tobiah have a room in the temple.
Nehemiah,13,8,It upset me so much that I threw out every bit of Tobiah's furniture.
Nehemiah,13,9,"Then I ordered the room to be cleaned and the temple utensils, the grain offerings, and the incense to be brought back into the room."
Nehemiah,13,10,"I also found out that the temple singers and several other Levites had returned to work on their farms, because they had not been given their share of the harvest."
Nehemiah,13,11,"I called the leaders together and angrily asked them, “Why is the temple neglected?” Then I told them to start doing their jobs."
Nehemiah,13,12,"After this, everyone in Judah brought a tenth of their grain, wine, and olive oil to the temple storeroom."
Nehemiah,13,13,"Finally, I appointed three men with good reputations to be in charge of what was brought there and to distribute it to the others. They were Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the teacher of the Law, and Pedaiah the Levite. Their assistant was Hanan, the son of Zaccur and the grandson of Mattaniah."
