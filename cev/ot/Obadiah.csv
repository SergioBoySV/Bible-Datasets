Obadiah,1,1,"The LORD God gave Obadiah
a message about Edom,
and this is what we heard:
“I, the LORD, have sent
a messenger
with orders for the nations
to attack Edom.”"
Obadiah,1,2,"The LORD said to Edom:
I will make you the weakest
and most despised nation."
Obadiah,1,3,"You live in a mountain fortress,
because your pride
makes you feel safe from attack,
but you are mistaken."
Obadiah,1,4,"I will still bring you down,
even if you fly higher
than an eagle
or nest among the stars.
I, the LORD, have spoken!"
Obadiah,1,5,"If thieves break in at night,
they steal
only what they want.
And people who harvest grapes
always leave some unpicked.
But, Edom, you are doomed!"
Obadiah,1,6,"Everything you treasure most
will be taken from you."
Obadiah,1,7,"Your allies can't be trusted.
They will force you out
of your own country.
And your best friends
will trick and trap you,
even before you know it."
Obadiah,1,8,"Edom, when this happens,
I, the LORD, will destroy
all your marvelous wisdom."
Obadiah,1,9,"Warriors from the city of Teman
will be terrified,
and you descendants of Esau
will be wiped out."
Obadiah,1,10,"You were cruel to your relatives,
the descendants of Jacob.
Now you will be destroyed,
disgraced forever."
Obadiah,1,11,"You stood there and watched
as foreigners entered Jerusalem
and took what they wanted.
In fact, you were no better
than those foreigners."
Obadiah,1,12,"Why did you celebrate
when such a dreadful disaster
struck your relatives?
Why were you so pleased
when everyone in Judah
was suffering?"
Obadiah,1,13,"They are my people,
and you were cruel to them.
You went through their towns,
sneering and stealing
whatever was left."
Obadiah,1,14,"In their time of torment,
you ambushed refugees
and handed them over
to their attackers."
Obadiah,1,15,"The day is coming
when I, the LORD,
will judge the nations.
And, Edom, you will pay in full
for what you have done."
Obadiah,1,16,"I forced the people of Judah
to drink the wine of my anger
on my sacred mountain.
Soon the neighboring nations
must drink their fill—
then vanish without a trace."
Obadiah,1,17,"The LORD's people who escape
will go to Mount Zion,
and it will be holy.
Then Jacob's descendants
will capture the land of those
who took their land."
Obadiah,1,18,"Israel will be a fire,
and Edom will be straw
going up in flames.
The LORD has spoken!"
Obadiah,1,19,"The people of Israel
who live in the Southern Desert
will take the land of Edom.
Those who live in the hills
will capture Philistia,
Ephraim, and Samaria.
And the tribe of Benjamin
will conquer Gilead."
Obadiah,1,20,"Those who return from captivity
will control Phoenicia
as far as Zarephath.
Captives from Jerusalem
who were taken to Sepharad
will capture the towns
of the Southern Desert."
Obadiah,1,21,"Those the LORD has saved
will live on Mount Zion
and rule over Edom.
Then the kingdom will belong
to the LORD."
