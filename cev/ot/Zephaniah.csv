Zephaniah,1,1,"I am Zephaniah, the son of Cushi, the grandson of Gedaliah, the great-grandson of Amariah, and the great-great-grandson of Hezekiah.
When Josiah son of Amon was king of Judah, the LORD gave me this message."
Zephaniah,1,2,"I, the LORD, now promise
to destroy everything
on this earth"
Zephaniah,1,3,"people and animals,
birds and fish.
Everyone who is evil
will crash to the ground,
and I will wipe out
the entire human race."
Zephaniah,1,4,"I will reach out to punish
Judah and Jerusalem—
nothing will remain
of the god Baal;
nothing will be remembered
of his pagan priests."
Zephaniah,1,5,"Not a trace will be found
of those who worship stars
from their rooftops,
or bow down to the god Milcom,
while claiming loyalty
to me, the LORD."
Zephaniah,1,6,"Nothing will remain of anyone
who has turned away
and rejected me."
Zephaniah,1,7,"Be silent! I am the LORD God,
and the time is near.
I am preparing
to sacrifice my people
and to invite my guests."
Zephaniah,1,8,"On that day I will punish
national leaders
and sons of the king,
along with all who follow
foreign customs."
Zephaniah,1,9,"I will punish worshipers
of pagan gods
and cruel palace officials
who abuse their power."
Zephaniah,1,10,"I, the LORD, promise
that on that day
noisy crying will be heard
from Fish Gate, New Town,
and Upper Hills."
Zephaniah,1,11,"Everyone in Lower Hollow
will mourn loudly,
because merchants
and money changers
will be wiped out."
Zephaniah,1,12,"I'll search Jerusalem with lamps
and punish those people
who sit there unworried
while thinking,
“The LORD won't do anything,
good or bad.”"
Zephaniah,1,13,"Their possessions will be taken,
their homes left in ruins.
They won't get to live
in the houses they build,
or drink wine from the grapes
in their own vineyards."
Zephaniah,1,14,"The great day of the LORD
is coming soon, very soon.
On that terrible day,
fearsome shouts of warriors
will be heard everywhere."
Zephaniah,1,15,"It will be a time of anger—
of trouble and torment,
of disaster and destruction,
of darkness and despair,
of storm clouds and shadows"
Zephaniah,1,16,"of trumpet calls
and battle cries
against fortified cities
and mighty fortresses."
Zephaniah,1,17,"The LORD warns everyone
who has sinned against him,
“I'll strike you blind!
Then your blood and your insides
will gush out like vomit."
Zephaniah,1,18,"Not even your silver or gold
can save you on that day
when I, the LORD, am angry.
My anger will flare up
like a furious fire
scorching the earth
and everyone on it.”"
Zephaniah,2,1,"You disgraceful nation,
gather around"
Zephaniah,2,2,"before it's too late.
The LORD has set a time
when his fierce anger
will strike like a storm
and sweep you away."
Zephaniah,2,3,"If you humbly obey the LORD,
then come and worship him.
If you do right and are humble,
perhaps you will be safe
on that day when the LORD
turns loose his anger."
Zephaniah,2,4,"Gaza and Ashkelon
will be deserted
and left in ruins.
Ashdod will be emptied
in broad daylight,
and Ekron uprooted."
Zephaniah,2,5,"To you people of Philistia
who live along the coast,
the LORD has this to say:
“I am now your enemy,
and I'll wipe you out!”"
Zephaniah,2,6,"Your seacoast will be changed
into pastureland
and sheep pens."
Zephaniah,2,7,"The LORD God hasn't forgotten
those survivors in Judah,
and he will help them—
his people will take your land
to use for pasture.
And when evening comes,
they will rest
in houses at Ashkelon.
*"
Zephaniah,2,8,"The LORD All-Powerful,
the God of Israel, said:
I've heard Moab and Ammon
insult my people
and threaten their nation."
Zephaniah,2,9,"And so, I swear by my very life
that Moab and Ammon will end up
like Sodom and Gomorrah—
covered with thornbushes
and salt pits forever.
Then my people who survive
will take their land."
Zephaniah,2,10,"This is how Moab and Ammon
will at last be repaid
for their pride—
and for sneering at the nation
that belongs to me,
the LORD All-Powerful."
Zephaniah,2,11,"I will fiercely attack.
Then every god on this earth
will shrink to nothing,
and everyone of every nation
will bow down to me,
right where they are."
Zephaniah,2,12,"People of Ethiopia,
the sword of the LORD
will slaughter you!"
Zephaniah,2,13,"The LORD will reach to the north
to crush Assyria
and overthrow Nineveh."
Zephaniah,2,14,"Herds of wild animals
will live in its rubble;
all kinds of desert owls
will perch on its stones
and hoot in the windows.
Noisy ravens will be heard
inside its buildings,
stripped bare of cedar."
Zephaniah,2,15,"This is the glorious city
that felt secure and said,
“I am the only one!”
Now it's merely ruins,
a home for wild animals.
Every passerby simply sneers
and makes vulgar signs."
Zephaniah,3,1,"Too bad for that disgusting,
corrupt, and lawless city!"
Zephaniah,3,2,"Forever rebellious
and rejecting correction,
Jerusalem refuses to trust
or obey the LORD God."
Zephaniah,3,3,"Its officials are roaring lions,
its judges are wolves;
in the evening they attack,
by morning nothing is left."
Zephaniah,3,4,"Jerusalem's prophets are proud
and not to be trusted.
The priests have disgraced
the place of worship
and abused God's Law."
Zephaniah,3,5,"All who do evil are shameless,
but the LORD does right
and is always fair.
With the dawn of each day,
God brings about justice."
Zephaniah,3,6,"The LORD wiped out nations
and left fortresses
crumbling in the dirt.
Their streets and towns
were reduced to ruins
and emptied of people."
Zephaniah,3,7,"God felt certain that Jerusalem
would learn to respect
and obey him.
Then he would hold back
from punishing the city
and not wipe it out.
But everyone there was eager
to start sinning again."
Zephaniah,3,8,"The LORD said:
Just wait for the day
when I accuse you nations.
I have decided on a day,
when I will bring together
every nation and kingdom
and punish them all
in my fiery anger.
I will become furious
and destroy the earth."
Zephaniah,3,9,"I will purify each language
and make those languages
acceptable for praising me.
Then, with hearts united,
everyone will serve
only me, the LORD."
Zephaniah,3,10,"From across the rivers
of Ethiopia,
my scattered people,
my true worshipers,
will bring offerings to me."
Zephaniah,3,11,"When that time comes,
you won't rebel against me
and be put to shame.
I'll do away with those
who are proud and arrogant.
Never will any of them
strut around
on my holy mountain."
Zephaniah,3,12,"But I, the LORD, won't destroy
any of your people
who are truly humble
and turn to me for safety."
Zephaniah,3,13,"The people of Israel who survive
will live right
and refuse to tell lies.
They will eat and rest
with nothing to fear."
Zephaniah,3,14,"Everyone in Jerusalem and Judah,
celebrate and shout
with all your heart!"
Zephaniah,3,15,"Zion, your punishment is over.
The LORD has forced your enemies
to turn and retreat.
Your LORD is King of Israel
and stands at your side;
you don't have to worry
about any more troubles."
Zephaniah,3,16,"Jerusalem, the time is coming,
when it will be said to you:
“Don't be discouraged
or grow weak from fear!"
Zephaniah,3,17,"The LORD your God
wins victory after victory
and is always with you.
He celebrates and sings
because of you,
and he will refresh your life
with his love.”"
Zephaniah,3,18,"The LORD has promised:
Your sorrow has ended,
and you can celebrate."
Zephaniah,3,19,"I will punish those
who mistreat you.
I will bring together the lame
and the outcasts,
then they will be praised,
instead of despised,
in every country on earth."
Zephaniah,3,20,"I will lead you home,
and with your own eyes
you will see me bless you
with all you once owned.
Then you will be famous
everywhere on this earth.
I, the LORD, have spoken!"
