Deuteronomy,1,1,"This book contains the speeches that Moses made while Israel was in the land of Moab, camped near the town of Suph in the desert east of the Jordan River. The town of Paran was in one direction from their camp, and the towns of Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab were in the opposite direction.
Earlier, Moses had defeated the Amorite King Sihon of Heshbon. Moses had also defeated King Og of Bashan, who used to live in Ashtaroth for part of the year and in Edrei for the rest of the year.
Although it takes only eleven days to walk from Mount Sinai to Kadesh-Barnea by way of the Mount Seir Road, these speeches were not made until 40 years after Israel left Egypt.

Deuteronomy,1,6,"People of Israel, when we were in our camp at Mount Sinai, the LORD our God told us:
You have stayed here long enough."
Deuteronomy,1,7,"Leave this place and go into the land that belongs to the Amorites and their neighbors the Canaanites. This land includes the Jordan River valley, the hill country, the western foothills, the Southern Desert, the Mediterranean seacoast, the Lebanon Mountains, and all the territory as far as the Euphrates River."
Deuteronomy,1,8,"I give you this land, just as I promised your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Now you must go and take the land."
Deuteronomy,1,9,"Right after the LORD commanded us to leave Mount Sinai, I told you:
Israel, being your leader is too big a job for one person."
Deuteronomy,1,10,"The LORD our God has blessed us, and so now there are as many of us as there are stars in the sky."
Deuteronomy,1,11,"God has even promised to bless us a thousand times more, and I pray that he will."
Deuteronomy,1,12,But I cannot take care of all your problems and settle all your arguments alone.
Deuteronomy,1,13,"Each tribe must choose some experienced men who are known for their wisdom and understanding, and I will make those men the official leaders of their tribes."
Deuteronomy,1,14,"You answered, “That's a good idea!”"
Deuteronomy,1,15,"Then I took these men, who were already wise and respected leaders, and I appointed them as your official leaders. Some of them became military officers in charge of groups of 1,000, or 100, or 50, or 10"
Deuteronomy,1,16,"and others became judges. I gave these judges the following instructions:
When you settle legal cases, your decisions must be fair. It doesn't matter if the case is between two Israelites, or between an Israelite and a foreigner living in your community."
Deuteronomy,1,17,"And it doesn't matter if one is helpless and the other is powerful. Don't be afraid of anyone! No matter who shows up in your court, God will help you make a fair decision.
If any case is too hard for you, bring the people to me, and I will make the decision."
Deuteronomy,1,18,"After I gave these instructions to the judges, I taught you the LORD's commands."
Deuteronomy,1,19,"The LORD had commanded us to leave Mount Sinai and go to the hill country that belonged to the Amorites, so we started out into the huge desert. You remember how frightening it was, but soon we were at Kadesh-Barnea"
Deuteronomy,1,20,"and I told you, “We have reached the hill country. It belongs to the Amorites now, but the LORD our God is giving it to us. He is the same God our ancestors worshiped, and he has told us to go in and take this land, so don't hesitate and be afraid.”"
Deuteronomy,1,21,"and I told you, “We have reached the hill country. It belongs to the Amorites now, but the LORD our God is giving it to us. He is the same God our ancestors worshiped, and he has told us to go in and take this land, so don't hesitate and be afraid.”"
Deuteronomy,1,22,"Then all of you came to me and said, “Before we go into the land, let's send some men to explore it. When they come back, they can tell us about the towns we will find and what roads we should take to get there.”"
Deuteronomy,1,23,"It seemed like a good idea, so I chose twelve men, one from each tribe."
Deuteronomy,1,24,They explored the hill country as far as Bunch Valley
Deuteronomy,1,25,"and even brought back some of the fruit. They said, “The LORD our God is giving us good land.”"
Deuteronomy,1,26,"You did not want to go into the land, and you refused to obey the LORD your God."
Deuteronomy,1,27,"You stayed in your tents and grumbled, “The LORD must hate us—he brought us out of Egypt, just so he could hand us over to the Amorites and get rid of us."
Deuteronomy,1,28,"We are afraid, because the men who explored the land told us that the cities are large, with walls that reach to the sky. The people who live there are taller and stronger than we are, and some of them are Anakim. We have nowhere to go.”"
Deuteronomy,1,29,"Then I said, “Don't worry!"
Deuteronomy,1,30,"The LORD our God will lead the way. He will fight on our side, just as he did when we saw him do all those things to the Egyptians."
Deuteronomy,1,31,"And you know that the LORD has taken care of us the whole time we've been in the desert, just as you might carry one of your children.”"
Deuteronomy,1,32,But you still would not trust the LORD
Deuteronomy,1,33,"even though he had always been with us in the desert. During the daytime, the LORD was in the cloud, leading us in the right direction and showing us where to camp. And at night, he was there in the fire."
Deuteronomy,1,34,"You had made the LORD angry, and he said"
Deuteronomy,1,35,"You people of this generation are evil, and I refuse to let you go into the good land that I promised your ancestors."
Deuteronomy,1,36,"Caleb son of Jephunneh is the only one of your generation that I will allow to go in. He obeyed me completely, so I will give him and his descendants the land he explored."
Deuteronomy,1,37,"The LORD was even angry with me because of you people, and he said, “Moses, I won't let you go into the land either."
Deuteronomy,1,38,"Instead, I will let Joshua your assistant lead Israel to conquer the land. So encourage him.”"
Deuteronomy,1,39,"Then the LORD spoke to you again:
People of Israel, you said that your innocent young children would be taken prisoner in the battle for the land. But someday I will let them go into the land, and with my help they will conquer it and live there."
Deuteronomy,1,40,"Now, turn around and go back into the desert by way of Red Sea Road."
Deuteronomy,1,41,"Then you told me, “We disobeyed the LORD our God, but now we want to obey him. We will go into the hill country and fight, just as he told us to do.” So you picked up your weapons, thinking it would be easy to take over the hill country."
Deuteronomy,1,42,"But the LORD said, “Moses, warn them not to go into the hill country. I won't help them fight, and their enemies will defeat them.”"
Deuteronomy,1,43,"I told you what the LORD had said, but you paid no attention. You disobeyed him and went into the hill country anyway. You thought you were so great!"
Deuteronomy,1,44,"But when the Amorites in the hill country attacked from their towns, you ran from them as you would run from a swarm of bees. The Amorites chased your troops into Seir as far as Hormah, killing them as they went."
Deuteronomy,1,45,"Then you came back to the place of worship at Kadesh-Barnea and wept, but the LORD would not listen to your prayers."
Deuteronomy,1,46,"After we had been in Kadesh for a few months, we obeyed the LORD and headed back into the desert by way of Red Sea Road."
Deuteronomy,2,1,We spent many years wandering around outside the hill country of Seir
Deuteronomy,2,2,"until the LORD said:
Moses"
Deuteronomy,2,3,Israel has wandered in these hills long enough. Turn and go north.
Deuteronomy,2,4,"And give the people these orders: “Be very careful, because you will soon go through the land that belongs to your relatives, the descendants of Esau. They are afraid of you"
Deuteronomy,2,5,"but don't start a war with them. I have given them the hill country of Seir, so I won't give any of it to you, not even enough to set a foot on."
Deuteronomy,2,6,"And as you go through their land, you will have to buy food and water from them.”"
Deuteronomy,2,7,"The LORD has helped us and taken care of us during the past 40 years that we have been in this huge desert. We've had everything we needed, and the LORD has blessed us and made us successful in whatever we have done."
Deuteronomy,2,8,"We went past the territory that belonged to our relatives, the descendants of Esau. We followed Arabah Road that starts in the south at Elath and Ezion-Geber, then we turned onto the desert road that leads to Moab."
Deuteronomy,2,9,"The LORD told me, “Don't try to start a war with Moab. Leave them alone, because I gave the land of Ar to them, and I will not let you have any of it.”"
Deuteronomy,2,10,"Before the LORD gave the Moabites their land, a large and powerful tribe lived there. They were the Emim, and they were as tall as the Anakim."
Deuteronomy,2,11,"The Moabites called them Emim, though others sometimes used the name Rephaim for both the Anakim and the Emim."
Deuteronomy,2,12,"The Horites used to live in Seir, but the Edomites took over that region. They killed many of the Horites and forced the rest of them to leave, just as Israel did to the people in the land that the LORD gave them."
Deuteronomy,2,13,"When we came to the Zered Gorge along the southern border of Moab, the LORD told us to cross the gorge into Moab, and we did."
Deuteronomy,2,14,"This was 38 years after we left Kadesh-Barnea, and by that time all the men who had been in the army at Kadesh-Barnea had died, just as the LORD had said they would."
Deuteronomy,2,15,The LORD kept getting rid of them until finally none of them were left.
Deuteronomy,2,16,The LORD kept getting rid of them until finally none of them were left.
Deuteronomy,2,17,Then the LORD told me
Deuteronomy,2,18,"“Moses, now go past the town of Ar and cross Moab's northern border"
Deuteronomy,2,19,"into Ammon. But don't start a war with the Ammonites. I gave them their land, and I won't give any of it to Israel.”"
Deuteronomy,2,20,"Before the Ammonites conquered the land that the LORD had given them, some of the Rephaim used to live there, although the Ammonites called them Zamzummim."
Deuteronomy,2,21,"The Zamzummim were a large and powerful tribe and were as tall as the Anakim. But the LORD helped the Ammonites, and they killed many of the Zamzummim and forced the rest to leave. Then the Ammonites settled there."
Deuteronomy,2,22,"The LORD helped them as he had helped the Edomites, who killed many of the Horites in Seir and forced the rest to leave before settling there themselves."
Deuteronomy,2,23,"A group called the Avvim used to live in villages as far south as Gaza, but the Philistines killed them and settled on their land."
Deuteronomy,2,24,"After we went through Ammon, the LORD told us:
Israel, pack up your possessions, take down your tents, and cross the Arnon River gorge. The territory of the Amorite King Sihon of Heshbon lies on the other side of the river, but I now give you his land. So attack and take it!"
Deuteronomy,2,25,"Today I will start making all other nations afraid of you. They will tremble with fear when anyone mentions you, and they will be terrified when you show up."
Deuteronomy,2,26,"After we had crossed the Arnon and had set up camp in the Kedemoth Desert, I sent messengers to King Sihon of Heshbon, telling him that his nation and ours could be at peace. I said"
Deuteronomy,2,27,"Please let Israel go across your country. We will walk straight through, without turning off the road."
Deuteronomy,2,28,"You can even sell us food and water, and we will pay with silver. We need to reach the Jordan River and cross it, because the LORD our God is giving us the land on the west side. The Edomites and Moabites have already let us cross their land. Please let us cross your land as well."
Deuteronomy,2,29,"You can even sell us food and water, and we will pay with silver. We need to reach the Jordan River and cross it, because the LORD our God is giving us the land on the west side. The Edomites and Moabites have already let us cross their land. Please let us cross your land as well."
Deuteronomy,2,30,"But Sihon refused to let us go across his country, because the LORD made him stubborn and eager to fight us. The LORD told me, “I am going to help you defeat Sihon and take his land, so attack him!”"
Deuteronomy,2,31,"But Sihon refused to let us go across his country, because the LORD made him stubborn and eager to fight us. The LORD told me, “I am going to help you defeat Sihon and take his land, so attack him!”"
Deuteronomy,2,32,We met Sihon and his army in battle at Jahaz
Deuteronomy,2,33,"and the LORD our God helped us defeat them. We killed Sihon, his sons, and everyone else in his army."
Deuteronomy,2,34,"Then we captured and destroyed every town in Sihon's kingdom, killing everyone"
Deuteronomy,2,35,but keeping the livestock and everything else of value.
Deuteronomy,2,36,"The LORD helped us capture every town from the Arnon River gorge north to the boundary of Gilead, including the town of Aroer on the edge of the gorge and the town in the middle of the gorge."
Deuteronomy,2,37,"However, we stayed away from all the Ammonite towns, both in the hill country and near the Jabbok River, just as the LORD had commanded."
Deuteronomy,3,1,"When we turned onto the road that leads to Bashan, King Og of Bashan led out his whole army to fight us at Edrei."
Deuteronomy,3,2,"But the LORD told me, “Moses, don't be afraid of King Og. I am going to help you defeat him and his army and take over his land. Destroy him and his people, just as you did with the Amorite King Sihon of Heshbon.”"

Deuteronomy,3,7,but keeping the livestock and everything else of value.
Deuteronomy,3,8,"Sihon and Og had ruled Amorite kingdoms east of the Jordan River. Their land stretched from the Arnon River gorge in the south to Mount Hermon in the north, and we captured it all."
Deuteronomy,3,9,"Mount Hermon is called Mount Sirion by the people of Sidon, and it is called Mount Senir by the Amorites."
Deuteronomy,3,10,"We captured all the towns in the highlands, all of Gilead, and all of Bashan as far as Salecah and Edrei, two of the towns that Og had ruled."
Deuteronomy,3,11,"King Og was the last of the Rephaim, and his coffin is in the town of Rabbah in Ammon. It is made of hard black rock and is four meters long and almost two meters wide."
Deuteronomy,3,12,"I gave some of the land and towns we captured to the tribes of Reuben and Gad. Their share started at the Arnon River gorge in the south, took in the town of Aroer on the edge of the gorge, and went far enough north to include the southern half of the Gilead region. The northern part of their land went as far east as the upper Jabbok River gorge, which formed their border with the Ammonites. I also gave them the eastern side of the Jordan River valley, from Lake Galilee south to the Dead Sea below the slopes of Mount Pisgah.
I gave the northern half of Gilead and all of the Bashan region to half the tribe of Manasseh. Bashan had belonged to King Og, and the Argob region in Bashan used to be called the Land of the Rephaim. Jair from the Manasseh tribe conquered the Argob region as far west as the kingdoms of Geshur and Maacah. The Israelites even started calling Bashan by the name “Villages of Jair,” and that is still its name. I gave the northern half of Gilead to the Machir clan."
Deuteronomy,3,13,"I gave some of the land and towns we captured to the tribes of Reuben and Gad.

The LORD our God told me to give you this land with its towns, and that's what I have done.

Deuteronomy,3,25,The land west of the Jordan is such good land. Please let me cross the Jordan and see the hills and the Lebanon Mountains.”
Deuteronomy,3,26,"But the LORD was angry with me because of you people, and he refused to listen. “That's enough!” he said. “I don't want to hear any more."
Deuteronomy,3,27,"Climb to the top of Mount Pisgah and look north, south, east, and west. Take a good look, but you are not going to cross the Jordan River."
Deuteronomy,3,28,"Joshua will lead Israel across the Jordan to take the land, so help him be strong and brave and tell him what he must do.”"
Deuteronomy,3,29,After this we stayed in the valley at Beth-Peor.
Deuteronomy,4,1,"Israel, listen to these laws and teachings! If you obey them, you will live, and you will go in and take the land that the LORD is giving you. He is the God your ancestors worshiped"
Deuteronomy,4,2,"and now he is your God. I am telling you everything he has commanded, so don't add anything or take anything away."

Deuteronomy,11,23,"he will help you take the land. And even though the nations there are more powerful than you, the LORD will force them to leave when you attack."
Deuteronomy,11,24,"You will capture the land everywhere you go, from the Southern Desert to the Lebanon Mountains, and from the Euphrates River west to the Mediterranean Sea."
Deuteronomy,11,25,"No one will be able to stand up to you. The LORD will make everyone terrified of you, just as he promised."

Deuteronomy,11,32,be careful to obey his laws and teachings that I am giving you today.

Deuteronomy,12,5,"Soon you will cross the Jordan, and the LORD will help you conquer your enemies and let you live in peace, there in the land he has given you. But after you are settled, life will be different. You must not offer sacrifices just anywhere you want to. Instead, the LORD will choose a place somewhere in Israel where you must go to worship him. All of your sacrifices and offerings must be taken there, including sacrifices to please the LORD and any gift you promise or voluntarily give him. That's where you must also take one tenth of your grain, wine, and olive oil, as well as the first-born of your cattle, sheep, and goats. You and your family and servants will eat your gifts and sacrifices and celebrate there at the place of worship, because the LORD your God has made you successful in everything you have done. And since Levites will not have any land of their own, you must ask some of them to come along and celebrate with you.
Sometimes you may want to kill an animal for food and not as a sacrifice. If the LORD has blessed you and given you enough cows or sheep or goats, then you can butcher one of them where you live. You can eat it just like the meat from a deer or gazelle that you kill when you go hunting. And even those people who are unclean and unfit for worship can have some of the meat. But you must not eat the blood of any animal—let the blood drain out on the ground."

Deuteronomy,14,22,"People of Israel, every year you must set aside ten percent of your grain harvest."

Deuteronomy,14,29,"The Levites have no land of their own, so you must give them food from the storehouse.

Deuteronomy,15,8,"Instead, be kind and lend them what they need."
Deuteronomy,15,9,"Be careful! Don't say to yourself, “Soon it will be the seventh year, and then I won't be able to get my money back.” It would be horrible for you to think that way and to be so selfish that you refuse to help the poor. They are your relatives, and if you don't help them, they may ask the LORD to decide whether you have done wrong. And he will say that you are guilty."
Deuteronomy,15,10,"You should be happy to give the poor what they need, because then the LORD will make you successful in everything you do."

Deuteronomy,15,21,"But if the animal is lame or blind or has something else wrong with it, you must not sacrifice it to the LORD your God."
Deuteronomy,15,22,"You can butcher it where you live, and eat it just like the meat of a deer or gazelle that you kill while hunting. Even those people who are unclean and unfit for worship can have some."

Deuteronomy,16,3,"Eat all of the meat of the Passover sacrifice that same night. But don't serve bread made with yeast at the Passover meal. Serve the same kind of thin bread that you ate when you were slaves suffering in Egypt and when you had to leave Egypt quickly.

Deuteronomy,19,2,"you must choose three of your towns to be Safe Towns. Divide the land into three regions with one Safe Town near the middle of each, so that a Safe Town can be easily reached from anywhere in your land.

Deuteronomy,29,23,"has become a scorching desert of salt and sulfur, where nothing is planted, nothing sprouts, and nothing grows. It will be as lifeless as the land around the cities of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, after the LORD became angry and destroyed them."
Deuteronomy,29,24,"People from other nations will ask, “Why did the LORD destroy this country? Why was he so furious?”"
Deuteronomy,29,25,"And they will be given this answer:
Our ancestors worshiped the LORD, but after he brought them out of Egypt and made an agreement with them, they rejected the agreement"
Deuteronomy,29,26,and decided to worship gods that had never helped them. The LORD had forbidden Israel to worship these gods
Deuteronomy,29,27,"and so he became furious and punished the land with all the curses in The Book of God's Law . Then he pulled up Israel by the roots and tossed them into a foreign country, where they still are today."
Deuteronomy,29,28,"and so he became furious and punished the land with all the curses in The Book of God's Law . Then he pulled up Israel by the roots and tossed them into a foreign country, where they still are today."
Deuteronomy,29,29,"The LORD our God hasn't explained the present or the future, but he has commanded us to obey the laws he gave to us and our descendants."
Deuteronomy,30,1,"I have told you everything the LORD your God will do for you, and I've also told you the curses he will put on you if you reject him. He will scatter you in faraway countries, but when you realize that he is punishing you"
Deuteronomy,30,2,return to him with all your heart and soul and start obeying the commands I have given to you today.
Deuteronomy,30,3,"Then he will stop punishing you and treat you with kindness. He may have scattered you to the farthest countries on earth, but he will bring you back"
Deuteronomy,30,4,"Then he will stop punishing you and treat you with kindness. He may have scattered you to the farthest countries on earth, but he will bring you back"
Deuteronomy,30,5,to the land that had belonged to your ancestors and make you even more successful and powerful than they ever were.
Deuteronomy,30,6,"You and your descendants are stubborn, but the LORD will make you willing to obey him and love him with all your heart and soul, and you will enjoy a long life."
Deuteronomy,30,7,Then the LORD your God will remove the curses from you and put them on those enemies who hate and attack you.
Deuteronomy,30,8,You will again obey the laws and teachings of the LORD
Deuteronomy,30,9,"and he will bless you with many children, large herds and flocks, and abundant crops. The LORD will be happy to do good things for you, just as he did for your ancestors."
Deuteronomy,30,10,But you must decide once and for all to worship him with all your heart and soul and to obey everything in The Book of God's Law .
Deuteronomy,30,11,"You know God's laws, and it isn't impossible to obey them."
Deuteronomy,30,12,"His commands aren't in heaven, so you can't excuse yourselves by saying, “How can we obey the LORD's commands? They are in heaven, and no one can go up to get them, then bring them down and explain them to us.”"
Deuteronomy,30,13,"And you can't say, “How can we obey the LORD's commands? They are across the sea, and someone must go across, then bring them back and explain them to us.”"
Deuteronomy,30,14,"No, these commands are nearby and you know them by heart. All you have to do is obey!"
Deuteronomy,30,15,Today I am giving you a choice. You can choose life and success or death and disaster.
Deuteronomy,30,16,"I am commanding you to be loyal to the LORD, to live the way he has told you, and to obey his laws and teachings. You are about to cross the Jordan River and take the land that he is giving you. If you obey him, you will live and become successful and powerful.
On the other hand, you might choose to disobey the LORD and reject him. So I'm warning you that if you bow down and worship other gods, you won't have long to live."
Deuteronomy,30,17,"I am commanding you to be loyal to the LORD, to live the way he has told you, and to obey his laws and teachings. You are about to cross the Jordan River and take the land that he is giving you. If you obey him, you will live and become successful and powerful.
On the other hand, you might choose to disobey the LORD and reject him. So I'm warning you that if you bow down and worship other gods, you won't have long to live."
Deuteronomy,30,18,"I am commanding you to be loyal to the LORD, to live the way he has told you, and to obey his laws and teachings. You are about to cross the Jordan River and take the land that he is giving you. If you obey him, you will live and become successful and powerful.
On the other hand, you might choose to disobey the LORD and reject him. So I'm warning you that if you bow down and worship other gods, you won't have long to live."
Deuteronomy,30,19,Now I call the sky and the earth to be witnesses that I am offering you this choice. Will you choose for the LORD to make you prosperous and give you a long life? Or will he put you under a curse and kill you? Choose life!
Deuteronomy,30,20,"Be completely faithful to the LORD your God, love him, and do whatever he tells you. The LORD is the only one who can give life, and he will let you live a long time in the land that he promised to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."
Deuteronomy,31,1,Moses again spoke to the whole nation of Israel
Deuteronomy,31,2,"I am 120 years old, and I am no longer able to be your leader. And besides that, the LORD your God has told me that he won't let me cross the Jordan River."
Deuteronomy,31,3,"But he has promised that he and Joshua will lead you across the Jordan to attack the nations that live on the other side. The LORD will destroy those nations just as he destroyed Sihon and Og, those two Amorite kings. Just remember—whenever you capture a place, kill everyone who lives there."
Deuteronomy,31,4,"But he has promised that he and Joshua will lead you across the Jordan to attack the nations that live on the other side. The LORD will destroy those nations just as he destroyed Sihon and Og, those two Amorite kings. Just remember—whenever you capture a place, kill everyone who lives there."
Deuteronomy,31,5,"But he has promised that he and Joshua will lead you across the Jordan to attack the nations that live on the other side. The LORD will destroy those nations just as he destroyed Sihon and Og, those two Amorite kings. Just remember—whenever you capture a place, kill everyone who lives there."
Deuteronomy,31,6,"Be brave and strong! Don't be afraid of the nations on the other side of the Jordan. The LORD your God will always be at your side, and he will never abandon you."
Deuteronomy,31,7,"Then Moses called Joshua up in front of the crowd and said:
Joshua, be brave and strong as you lead these people into their land. The LORD made a promise long ago to Israel's ancestors that this land would someday belong to Israel. That time has now come, and you must divide up the land among the people."
Deuteronomy,31,8,"The LORD will lead you into the land. He will always be with you and help you, so don't ever be afraid of your enemies."
Deuteronomy,31,9,"Moses wrote down all of these laws and teachings and gave them to the priests and the leaders of Israel. The priests were from the Levi tribe, and they carried the sacred chest that belonged to the LORD."
Deuteronomy,31,10,"Moses told these priests and leaders:
Each year the Israelites must come together to celebrate the Festival of Shelters at the place where the LORD chooses to be worshiped. You must read these laws and teachings to the people at the festival every seventh year, the year when loans do not need to be repaid."
Deuteronomy,31,11,"Moses told these priests and leaders:
Each year the Israelites must come together to celebrate the Festival of Shelters at the place where the LORD chooses to be worshiped. You must read these laws and teachings to the people at the festival every seventh year, the year when loans do not need to be repaid."
Deuteronomy,31,12,"Everyone must come—men, women, children, and even the foreigners who live in your towns. And each new generation will listen and learn to worship the LORD their God with fear and trembling and to do exactly what is said in God's Law."
Deuteronomy,31,13,"Everyone must come—men, women, children, and even the foreigners who live in your towns. And each new generation will listen and learn to worship the LORD their God with fear and trembling and to do exactly what is said in God's Law."
Deuteronomy,31,14,"The LORD told Moses, “You will soon die, so bring Joshua to the sacred tent, and I will appoint him the leader of Israel.”
Moses and Joshua went to the sacred tent"
Deuteronomy,31,15,and the LORD appeared in a thick cloud right over the entrance to the tent.
Deuteronomy,31,16,"The LORD said:
Moses, you will soon die. But Israel is going into a land where other gods are worshiped, and Israel will reject me and start worshiping these gods. The people will break the agreement I made with them"
Deuteronomy,31,17,"and I will be so furious that I will abandon them and ignore their prayers. I will send disasters and suffering that will nearly wipe them out. Finally, they will realize that the disasters happened because I abandoned them."
Deuteronomy,31,18,"They will pray to me, but I will ignore them because they were evil and started worshiping other gods."
Deuteronomy,31,19,"Moses and Joshua, I am going to give you the words to a new song. Write them down and teach the song to the Israelites. If they learn it, they will know what I want them to do, and so they will have no excuse for not obeying me."
Deuteronomy,31,20,"I am bringing them into the land that I promised their ancestors. It is a land rich with milk and honey, and the Israelites will have more than enough food to eat. But they will get fat and turn their backs on me and start worshiping other gods. The Israelites will reject me and break the agreement that I made with them."
Deuteronomy,31,21,"When I punish the Israelites and their descendants with suffering and disasters, I will remind them that they know the words to this song, so they have no excuse for not obeying me.
I will give them the land that I promised, but I know the way they are going to live later on."
Deuteronomy,31,22,"Moses at once wrote down the words to the song, and he taught it to the Israelites."
Deuteronomy,31,23,"The LORD told Joshua, “Be brave and strong! I will help you lead the people of Israel into the land that I have promised them.”"
Deuteronomy,31,24,Moses wrote down all these laws and teachings in a book
Deuteronomy,31,25,then he went to the Levites who carried the sacred chest and said
Deuteronomy,31,26,This is The Book of God's Law . Keep it beside the sacred chest that holds the agreement the LORD your God made with Israel. This book is proof that you know what the LORD wants you to do.
Deuteronomy,31,27,"I know how stubborn and rebellious you and the rest of the Israelites are. You have rebelled against the LORD while I have been alive, and it will only get worse after I am gone."
Deuteronomy,31,28,"So call together the leaders and officials of the tribes of Israel. I will bring this book and read every word of it to you, and I will call the sky and the earth as witnesses that all of you know what you are supposed to do."
Deuteronomy,31,29,"I am going to die soon, and I know that in the future you will stop caring about what is right and what is wrong, and so you will disobey the LORD and stop living the way I told you to live. The LORD will be angry, and terrible things will happen to you."
Deuteronomy,31,30,"Moses called a meeting of all the people of Israel, so he could teach them the words to the song that the LORD had given him. And here are the words"
Deuteronomy,32,1,"Earth and Sky,
listen to what I say!"

to be his children."

but you repaid him
by being foolish."
Deuteronomy,32,7,"Think about past generations.
Ask your parents
or any of your elders.
They will tell you"
Deuteronomy,32,8,"that God Most High
gave land to every nation.
He assigned a guardian angel
to each of them"
Deuteronomy,32,9,"but the LORD himself
takes care of Israel."
Deuteronomy,32,10,"Israel, the LORD discovered you
in a barren desert
filled with howling winds.
God became your fortress,
protecting you as though
you were his own eyes."
Deuteronomy,32,11,"The LORD was like an eagle
teaching its young to fly,
always ready to swoop down
and catch them on its back."
Deuteronomy,32,12,"Israel, the LORD led you,
and without the aid
of a foreign god"
Deuteronomy,32,13,"he helped you
capture the land.
Your fields were rich
with grain.
Olive trees grew
in your stony soil,
and honey was found
among the rocks."
Deuteronomy,32,14,"Your flocks and herds
produced milk and yogurt,
and you got choice meat
from your sheep and goats
that grazed in Bashan.

and you drank the best wine."
Deuteronomy,32,15,"Israel, you grew fat and rebelled
against God, your Creator
you rejected the Mighty Rock,
your only place of safety."
Deuteronomy,32,16,"You made God jealous and angry
by worshiping disgusting idols
and foreign gods."
Deuteronomy,32,17,"You offered sacrifices
to demons, those useless gods
that never helped you,
new gods that your ancestors
never worshiped."
Deuteronomy,32,18,"You turned away
from God, your Creator;
you forgot the Mighty Rock,
the source of your life."
Deuteronomy,32,19,"You were the LORD's children,
but you made him angry.
Then he rejected you"
Deuteronomy,32,20,"and said,
“You are unfaithful
and can't be trusted.
So I won't answer your prayers;
I'll just watch and see
what happens to you."

and made me jealous
and angry!
Now I will send a cruel
and worthless nation
to make you jealous and angry."

will be killed in the streets
and terrified at home."

that's what the LORD
has said to you.
But you don't have good sense,
and you never listen
to advice."
Deuteronomy,32,29,"If you did, you could see
where you are headed."
Deuteronomy,32,30,"How could one enemy soldier
chase a thousand
of Israel's troops?
Or how could two of theirs
pursue ten thousand of ours?
It can only happen if the LORD
stops protecting Israel
and lets the enemy win."
Deuteronomy,32,31,"Even our enemies know
that only our God
is a Mighty Rock."
Deuteronomy,32,32,"Our enemies are grapevines
rooted in the fields
of Sodom and Gomorrah.
The grapes they produce
are full of bitter poison"

than cobra venom."

a list of their sins
and locked it in his vault."
Deuteronomy,32,35,"Soon our enemies will get
what they deserve—
suddenly they will slip,
and total disaster
will quickly follow."
Deuteronomy,32,36,"When only a few
of the LORD's people remain,
when their strength is gone,
and some of them are slaves,
the LORD will feel sorry for them
and give them justice."
Deuteronomy,32,37,"But first the LORD will say,
“You ran for safety to other gods—
couldn't they help you?"
Deuteronomy,32,38,"You offered them wine
and your best sacrifices.
Can't those gods help you now
or give you protection?"
