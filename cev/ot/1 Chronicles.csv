1 Chronicles,14,10,"David asked God, “Should I attack the Philistines? Will you help me win?”
The LORD told David, “Yes, attack them! I will give you victory.”"
1 Chronicles,14,11,"David and his army marched to Baal-Perazim, where they attacked and defeated the Philistines. He said, “I defeated my enemies because God broke through them like a mighty flood.” So he named the place “The Lord Broke Through.”"

1 Chronicles,14,13,"Some time later, the Philistines came back into the hill country and camped in Rephaim Valley."
1 Chronicles,14,14,"David asked God what he should do, and God answered, “Don't attack them from the front. Circle around behind them where the balsam trees are."
1 Chronicles,14,15,Wait there until you hear the treetops making the sound of marching troops. That sound will mean I have marched out ahead of you to fight the Philistine army. So you must then attack quickly!”
1 Chronicles,14,16,David obeyed God and he defeated the Philistines. He even chased them all the way from Gibeon to the entrance to Gezer.
1 Chronicles,14,17,"From then on, David became even more famous, and the LORD made all the nations afraid of him."

You and your relatives must first go through the ceremony to make yourselves clean and acceptable to the LORD. Then you may carry the sacred chest that belongs to the LORD God of Israel and bring it to the place I have prepared for it."
1 Chronicles,15,13,"The first time we tried to bring the chest to Jerusalem, we didn't ask the LORD what he wanted us to do. He was angry with us, because you Levites weren't there to carry the chest.”"

David, you are my servant, so listen carefully: You are not the one to build a temple for me."

But when David's officials arrived at Ammon"
1 Chronicles,19,3,"the Ammonite leaders said to Hanun, “Do you really believe King David is honoring your father by sending these men to comfort you? He probably sent them to spy on our country, so he can come and destroy it.”"
1 Chronicles,19,4,"Hanun arrested David's officials and had their beards shaved off and their robes cut off just below the waist, and then he sent them away."
1 Chronicles,19,5,"They were terribly ashamed.
When David found out what had happened to his officials, he sent a message that told them, “Stay in Jericho until your beards grow back. Then you can come home.”"
1 Chronicles,19,6,The Ammonites realized they had made David furious. So they paid 34 tons of silver to hire chariot troops from Mesopotamia and from the Syrian kingdoms of Maacah and Zobah.
1 Chronicles,19,7,"Thirty-two thousand troops, as well as the king of Maacah and his army, came and camped near Medeba. The Ammonite troops also left their towns and came to prepare for battle."
1 Chronicles,19,8,"David heard what was happening, and he sent out Joab with his army."
1 Chronicles,19,9,"The Ammonite troops marched to the entrance of the city and prepared for battle, while the Syrian troops took their positions in the open fields."
1 Chronicles,19,10,Joab saw that the enemy troops were lined up on both sides of him. So he picked some of the best Israelite soldiers to fight the Syrians.
1 Chronicles,19,11,Then he put his brother Abishai in command of the rest of the army and told them to fight against the Ammonites.
1 Chronicles,19,12,"Joab told his brother, “If the Syrians are too much for me to handle, come and help me. And if the Ammonites are too strong for you, I'll come and help you."
1 Chronicles,19,13,Be brave and fight hard to protect our people and the towns of our LORD God. I pray he will do whatever pleases him.”
1 Chronicles,19,14,"Joab and his soldiers attacked the Syrians, and the Syrians ran from them."

1 Chronicles,19,16,"As soon as the Syrians realized they had been defeated, they sent for their troops that were stationed on the other side of the Euphrates River. Shophach, the commander of Hadadezer's army, led these troops to Ammon."
1 Chronicles,19,17,"David found out what the Syrians were doing, and he brought Israel's entire army together. They crossed the Jordan River, and he commanded them to take their positions facing the Syrian troops.
Soon after the fighting began"
1 Chronicles,19,18,"the Syrians ran from Israel. David killed 7,000 chariot troops and 40,000 regular soldiers. He also killed Shophach, their commander."
1 Chronicles,19,19,"When the kings who had been under Hadadezer's rule saw that Israel had defeated them, they made peace with David and accepted him as their new ruler. The Syrians never helped the Ammonites again."
1 Chronicles,20,1,"The next spring, the time when kings go to war, Joab marched out in command of the Israelite army and destroyed towns all over the country of Ammon. He attacked the capital city of Rabbah and left it in ruins. But David stayed in Jerusalem."
1 Chronicles,20,2,"Later, David himself went to Rabbah, where he took the crown from the statue of their god Milcom. The crown was made of about 34 kilograms of gold, and there was a valuable jewel on it. David put the jewel on his crown, then carried off everything else of value."
1 Chronicles,20,3,"He forced the people of Rabbah to work with saws, iron picks, and axes. He also did the same thing with the people in all the other Ammonite towns.
David then led Israel's army back to Jerusalem."
1 Chronicles,20,4,"Some time later, Israel fought a battle against the Philistines at Gezer. During this battle, Sibbecai from Hushah killed Sippai, a descendant of the Rephaim, and the Philistines were defeated."
1 Chronicles,20,5,"In another battle against the Philistines, Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath from Gath, whose spear shaft was like a weaver's beam."
1 Chronicles,20,6,Another one of the Philistine soldiers who was a descendant of the Rephaim was as big as a giant and had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot. During a battle at Gath
1 Chronicles,20,7,"he made fun of Israel, so David's nephew Jonathan killed him."
1 Chronicles,20,8,David and his soldiers killed these three men from Gath who were descendants of the Rephaim.
1 Chronicles,21,1,Satan decided to cause trouble for Israel by making David think it was a good idea to find out how many people there were in Israel and Judah.
1 Chronicles,21,2,"David told Joab and the army commanders, “Count everyone in Israel, from the town of Beersheba in the south all the way north to Dan. Then I will know how many people can serve in my army.”"
1 Chronicles,21,3,"Joab answered, “Your Majesty, even if the LORD made your kingdom a hundred times larger, you would still rule everyone in it. Why do you need to know how many soldiers there are? Don't you think that would make the whole nation angry?”"
1 Chronicles,21,4,But David would not change his mind. And so Joab went everywhere in Israel and Judah and counted the people. He returned to Jerusalem
1 Chronicles,21,5,"and told David that the total number of men who could serve in the army was 1,100,000 in Israel and 470,000 in Judah."
1 Chronicles,21,6,"Joab refused to include anyone from the tribes of Levi and Benjamin, because he still disagreed with David's orders."
1 Chronicles,21,7,"David's order to count the people made God angry, and he punished Israel."
1 Chronicles,21,8,"David prayed, “I am your servant. But what I did was stupid and terribly wrong. Please forgive me.”"
1 Chronicles,21,9,"The LORD said to Gad, one of David's prophets"
1 Chronicles,21,10,“Tell David that I will punish him in one of three ways. But he will have to choose which one it will be.”
1 Chronicles,21,11,"Gad went to David and told him:
You must choose how the LORD will punish you"
1 Chronicles,21,12,"Will there be three years when the land won't grow enough food for its people? Or will your enemies constantly defeat you for three months? Or will the LORD send a horrible disease to strike your land for three days? Think about it and decide, because I have to give your answer to God who sent me."
1 Chronicles,21,13,"David was miserable and said, “It's a terrible choice to make! But the LORD is kind, and I'd rather be punished by him than by anyone else.”"
1 Chronicles,21,14,"So the LORD sent a horrible disease on Israel, and 70,000 Israelites died."
1 Chronicles,21,15,"Then he sent an angel to destroy the city of Jerusalem. But just as the angel was about to do that, the LORD felt sorry for all the suffering he had caused the people, and he told the angel, “Stop! They have suffered enough.” This happened at the threshing place that belonged to Araunah the Jebusite."
1 Chronicles,21,16,"David saw the LORD's angel in the air, holding a sword over Jerusalem. He and the leaders of Israel, who were all wearing sackcloth, bowed with their faces to the ground"
1 Chronicles,21,17,"and David prayed, “It's my fault! I sinned by ordering the people to be counted. They have done nothing wrong—they are innocent sheep. LORD God, please punish me and my family. Don't let the disease wipe out your people.”"
1 Chronicles,21,18,The LORD's angel told the prophet Gad to tell David that he must go to Araunah's threshing place and build an altar in honor of the LORD.
1 Chronicles,21,19,David followed the LORD's instructions.
1 Chronicles,21,20,"Araunah and his four sons were threshing wheat at the time, and when they saw the angel, the four sons ran to hide."
1 Chronicles,21,21,"Just then, David arrived, and when Araunah saw him, he stopped his work and bowed down."
1 Chronicles,21,22,"David said, “Would you sell me your threshing place, so I can build an altar on it to the LORD? Then this disease will stop killing the people. I'm willing to pay whatever you say it's worth.”"
1 Chronicles,21,23,"Araunah answered, “Take it, Your Majesty, and do whatever you want with it. I'll even give you the oxen for the sacrifice and the wheat for the grain sacrifice. And you can use the threshing-boards for the fire. It's all yours!”"
1 Chronicles,21,24,"But David replied, “No! I want to pay you what they're worth. I can't just take something from you and then offer the LORD a sacrifice that cost me nothing.”"
1 Chronicles,21,25,So David paid Araunah 600 gold coins for his threshing place.
1 Chronicles,21,26,"David built an altar and offered sacrifices to please the LORD and sacrifices to ask his blessing. David prayed, and the LORD answered him by sending fire down on the altar."
1 Chronicles,21,27,Then the LORD commanded the angel to put the sword away.
1 Chronicles,21,28,"When David saw that the LORD had answered his prayer, he offered more sacrifices there at the threshing place"
1 Chronicles,21,29,"because he was afraid of the angel's sword and did not want to go all the way to Gibeon. That's where the sacred tent that Moses had made in the desert was kept, as well as the altar where sacrifices were offered to the LORD."
1 Chronicles,21,30,"because he was afraid of the angel's sword and did not want to go all the way to Gibeon. That's where the sacred tent that Moses had made in the desert was kept, as well as the altar where sacrifices were offered to the LORD."
1 Chronicles,22,1,"David said, “The temple of the LORD God must be built right here at this threshing place. And the altar for offering sacrifices will also be here.”"
1 Chronicles,22,2,David ordered the foreigners living in Israel to come to Jerusalem. Then he assigned some to cut blocks of stone for building the temple.
1 Chronicles,22,3,"He got a large supply of iron to make into nails and hinges for the doors, and he provided so much bronze that it could not be weighed."
1 Chronicles,22,4,He also brought an endless supply of cedar logs from the cities of Sidon and Tyre.
1 Chronicles,22,5,"He said, “The temple for the LORD must be great, so that everyone in the world will know about it. But since my son Solomon is young and has no experience, I will make sure that everything is ready for the temple to be built.”
That's why David did all these things before he died."
1 Chronicles,22,6,David sent for his son Solomon and told him to build a temple for the LORD God of Israel.
1 Chronicles,22,7,"He said:
My son, I wanted to build a temple where the LORD my God would be worshiped."
1 Chronicles,22,8,"But some time ago, he told me, “David, you have killed too many people and have fought too many battles. That's why you are not the one to build my temple."
1 Chronicles,22,9,"But when your son becomes king, I will give him peace throughout his kingdom. His name will be Solomon, because during his rule I will keep Israel safe and peaceful."
1 Chronicles,22,10,"Solomon will build my temple. He will be like a son to me, and I will be like a father to him. In fact, one of his descendants will always rule in Israel.”"
1 Chronicles,22,11,"Solomon, my son, I now pray that the LORD your God will be with you and keep his promise to help you build a temple for him."
1 Chronicles,22,12,"May he give you wisdom and knowledge, so that you can rule Israel according to his Law."
1 Chronicles,22,13,"If you obey the laws and teachings that the LORD gave Moses, you will be successful. Be strong and brave and don't get discouraged or be afraid of anything."
1 Chronicles,22,14,"I have all the supplies you'll need to build the temple: You have more than 3,000 tons of gold and over 34,000 tons of silver. There's also plenty of wood, stone, and more bronze and iron than I could weigh. Ask for anything else you need."
1 Chronicles,22,15,I have also assigned men who will cut and lay the stone. And there are carpenters and people who are experts in working with
1 Chronicles,22,16,"gold, silver, bronze, and iron. You have plenty of workers to do the job. Now get started, and I pray that the LORD will be with you in your work."
1 Chronicles,22,17,David then gave orders for the leaders of Israel to help Solomon.
1 Chronicles,22,18,"David said:
The LORD our God has helped me defeat all the people who lived here before us, and he has given you peace from all your enemies. Now this land belongs to the LORD and his people."
1 Chronicles,22,19,"Obey the LORD your God with your heart and soul. Begin work on the temple to honor him, so that the sacred chest and the things used for worship can be kept there."
1 Chronicles,23,1,David was old when he chose his son Solomon to be king of Israel.
1 Chronicles,23,2,"Some time later, David called together all of Israel's leaders, priests, and Levites."
1 Chronicles,23,3,"He then counted the Levite men who were at least 30 years old, and the total was 38,000."
1 Chronicles,23,4,"He said, “Twenty-four thousand of the Levites will be in charge of the temple, 6,000 will be temple officials and judges"
1 Chronicles,23,5,"4,000 will be guards at the temple, and 4,000 will praise the LORD by playing the musical instruments I have given them.”"
1 Chronicles,23,6,"David then divided the Levites into three groups according to the clans of Levi's sons, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari."
1 Chronicles,23,7,Gershon had two sons: Ladan and Shimei.
1 Chronicles,23,8,"Ladan was the father of Jehiel, Zetham, and Joel."
1 Chronicles,23,9,"They were all family leaders among their father's descendants. Shimei was the father of Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran."
1 Chronicles,23,10,"Later, Shimei had four more sons, in the following order: Jahath, Ziza, Jeush, and Beriah. But Jeush and Beriah didn't have many children, so their descendants were counted as one family."
1 Chronicles,23,11,"Later, Shimei had four more sons, in the following order: Jahath, Ziza, Jeush, and Beriah. But Jeush and Beriah didn't have many children, so their descendants were counted as one family."
1 Chronicles,23,12,"Kohath had four sons: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel."
1 Chronicles,23,13,Amram was the father of Aaron and Moses. Aaron and his descendants were chosen to be in charge of all the sacred things. They served the LORD by offering sacrifices to him and by blessing the people in his name.
1 Chronicles,23,14,"Moses, the man of God, was the father of Gershom and Eliezer, and their descendants were considered Levites."
1 Chronicles,23,15,"Moses, the man of God, was the father of Gershom and Eliezer, and their descendants were considered Levites."
1 Chronicles,23,16,Gershom's oldest son was Shebuel.
1 Chronicles,23,17,"Rehabiah, who was Eliezer's only son, had many children."
1 Chronicles,23,18,"The second son born to Kohath was Izhar, and his oldest son was Shelomith."
1 Chronicles,23,19,"Hebron, the third son of Kohath, was the father of Jeriah, Amariah, Jahaziel, and Jekameam."
1 Chronicles,23,20,"Kohath's youngest son, Uzziel, was the father of Micah and Isshiah."
1 Chronicles,23,21,Merari had two sons: Mahli and Mushi. Mahli was the father of Eleazar and Kish.
1 Chronicles,23,22,"Eleazar had no sons, only daughters, and they married their uncle's sons."
1 Chronicles,23,23,"Mushi the second son of Merari, was the father of Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth."
1 Chronicles,23,24,These were the clans and families of the tribe of Levi. Those who were 20 years and older were assigned to work at the LORD's temple.
1 Chronicles,23,25,"David said:
The LORD God of Israel has given his people peace, and he will live in Jerusalem forever."
1 Chronicles,23,26,"And so, the Levites won't need to move the sacred tent and the things used for worship from place to place."
1 Chronicles,23,27,"From now on, all Levites at least 20 years old"
1 Chronicles,23,28,"will serve the LORD by helping Aaron's descendants do their work at the temple, by keeping the courtyards and rooms of the temple clean, and by making sure that everything used in worship stays pure."
1 Chronicles,23,29,"They will also be in charge of the sacred loaves of bread, the flour for the grain sacrifices, the thin wafers, any offerings to be baked, and the flour mixed with olive oil. These Levites will weigh and measure these offerings."
1 Chronicles,23,30,"Every morning and evening, the Levites are to give thanks to the LORD and sing praises to him."
1 Chronicles,23,31,"They must also give thanks and sing praises when sacrifices are offered on each Sabbath, as well as during New Moon Festivals and other religious feasts. There must always be enough Levites on duty at the temple to do everything that needs to be done."
1 Chronicles,23,32,They were once in charge of taking care of the sacred tent; now they are responsible for the temple and for helping Aaron's descendants.
1 Chronicles,24,1,"Aaron's descendants were then divided into work groups. Aaron had four sons: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar."
1 Chronicles,24,2,"But Nadab and Abihu died long before their father, without having any sons. That's why Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests."
1 Chronicles,24,3,"David divided Aaron's descendants into groups, according to their assigned work. Zadok, one of Eleazar's descendants, and Ahimelech, one of Ithamar's descendants, helped David."
1 Chronicles,24,4,"Eleazar's descendants were divided into 16 groups, and Ithamar's were divided into eight groups, because Eleazar's family included more family leaders."
1 Chronicles,24,5,"However, both families included temple officials and priests, and so to make sure the work was divided fairly, David asked God what to do."
1 Chronicles,24,6,"As each group was assigned their duties, Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the Levite wrote down the name of the family leader in charge of that group. The witnesses were David and his officials, as well as Zadok the priest, Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the family leaders from the clans of the priests and the Levites."
