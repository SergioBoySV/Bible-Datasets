Isaiah,1,1,"The vision concerning Judah and Jerusalem that Isaiah son of Amoz saw during the reigns of Kings Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah of Judah."
Isaiah,1,2,"Listen, heavens, and pay attention, earth,
for the LORD has spoken:
“I have raised children and brought them up,
but they have rebelled against me."
Isaiah,1,3,"The ox knows its owner,
and the donkey its master’s feeding trough,
but Israel does not know;
my people do not understand.”"
Isaiah,1,4,"Oh sinful nation,
people weighed down with iniquity,
brood of evildoers,
depraved children!
They have abandoned the LORD;
they have despised the Holy One of Israel;
they have turned their backs on him."
Isaiah,1,5,"Why do you want more beatings?
Why do you keep on rebelling?
The whole head is hurt,
and the whole heart is sick."
Isaiah,1,6,"From the sole of the foot even to the head,
no spot is uninjured  —
wounds, welts, and festering sores
not cleansed, bandaged,
or soothed with oil."
Isaiah,1,7,"Your land is desolate,
your cities burned down;
foreigners devour your fields
right in front of you —
a desolation, like a place demolished by foreigners."
Isaiah,1,8,"Daughter Zion is abandoned
like a shelter in a vineyard,
like a shack in a cucumber field,
like a besieged city."
Isaiah,1,9,"If the LORD of Armies
had not left us a few survivors,
we would be like Sodom,
we would resemble Gomorrah."
Isaiah,1,10,"Hear the word of the LORD,
you rulers of Sodom!
Listen to the instruction of our God,
you people of Gomorrah!"
Isaiah,1,11,"“What are all your sacrifices to me?”
asks the LORD.
“I have had enough of burnt offerings and rams
and the fat of well-fed cattle;
I have no desire for the blood of bulls,
lambs, or male goats."
Isaiah,1,12,"When you come to appear before me,
who requires this from you —
this trampling of my courts?"
Isaiah,1,13,"Stop bringing useless offerings.
Your incense is detestable to me.
New Moons and Sabbaths,
and the calling of solemn assemblies  —
I cannot stand iniquity with a festival."
Isaiah,1,14,"I hate your New Moons and prescribed festivals.
They have become a burden to me;
I am tired of putting up with them."
Isaiah,1,15,"When you spread out your hands in prayer,
I will refuse to look at you;
even if you offer countless prayers,
I will not listen.
Your hands are covered with blood."
Isaiah,1,16,"“Wash yourselves. Cleanse yourselves.
Remove your evil deeds from my sight.
Stop doing evil."
Isaiah,1,17,"Learn to do what is good.
Pursue justice.
Correct the oppressor.
Defend the rights of the fatherless.
Plead the widow’s cause."
Isaiah,1,18,"“Come, let’s settle this,”
says the LORD.
“Though your sins are scarlet,
they will be as white as snow;
though they are crimson red,
they will be like wool."
Isaiah,1,19,"If you are willing and obedient,
you will eat the good things of the land."
Isaiah,1,20,"But if you refuse and rebel,
you will be devoured by the sword.”
For the mouth of the LORD has spoken."
Isaiah,1,21,"The faithful town —
what an adulteress she has become!
She was once full of justice.
Righteousness once dwelt in her,
but now, murderers!"
Isaiah,1,22,"Your silver has become dross to be discarded,
your beer is diluted with water."
Isaiah,1,23,"Your rulers are rebels,
friends of thieves.
They all love graft
and chase after bribes.
They do not defend the rights of the fatherless,
and the widow’s case never comes before them."
Isaiah,1,24,"Therefore the Lord GOD of Armies,
the Mighty One of Israel, declares:
“Ah, I will get even with my foes;
I will take revenge against my enemies."
Isaiah,1,25,"I will turn my hand against you
and will burn away your dross completely;
I will remove all your impurities."
Isaiah,1,26,"I will restore your judges to what they were at first,
and your advisers to what they were at the start.
Afterward you will be called the Righteous City,
a Faithful Town.”"
Isaiah,1,27,"Zion will be redeemed by justice,
those who repent, by righteousness."
Isaiah,1,28,"At the same time both rebels and sinners will be broken,
and those who abandon the LORD will perish."
Isaiah,1,29,"Indeed, they will be ashamed of the sacred trees
you desired,
and you will be embarrassed because of the garden shrines
you have chosen."
Isaiah,1,30,"For you will become like an oak
whose leaves are withered,
and like a garden without water."
Isaiah,1,31,"The strong one will become tinder,
and his work a spark;
both will burn together,
with no one to extinguish the flames."
Isaiah,2,1,The vision that Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem
Isaiah,2,2,"In the last days
the mountain of the LORD’s house will be established
at the top of the mountains
and will be raised above the hills.
All nations will stream to it"
Isaiah,2,3,"and many peoples will come and say,
“Come, let’s go up to the mountain of the LORD,
to the house of the God of Jacob.
He will teach us about his ways
so that we may walk in his paths.”
For instruction will go out of Zion
and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem."
Isaiah,2,4,"He will settle disputes among the nations
and provide arbitration for many peoples.
They will beat their swords into plows
and their spears into pruning knives.
Nation will not take up the sword against nation,
and they will never again train for war."
Isaiah,2,5,"House of Jacob,
come and let’s walk in the LORD’s light."
Isaiah,2,6,"For you have abandoned your people,
the house of Jacob,
because they are full of divination from the East
and of fortune-tellers like the Philistines.
They are in league with foreigners."
Isaiah,2,7,"Their land is full of silver and gold,
and there is no limit to their treasures;
their land is full of horses,
and there is no limit to their chariots."
Isaiah,2,8,"Their land is full of worthless idols;
they worship the work of their hands,
what their fingers have made."
Isaiah,2,9,"So humanity is brought low,
and each person is humbled.
Do not forgive them!"
Isaiah,2,10,"Go into the rocks
and hide in the dust
from the terror of the LORD
and from his majestic splendor."
Isaiah,2,11,"The pride of mankind will be humbled,
and human loftiness will be brought low;
the LORD alone will be exalted on that day."
Isaiah,2,12,"For a day belonging to the LORD of Armies is coming
against all that is proud and lofty,
against all that is lifted up — it will be humbled "
Isaiah,2,13,"against all the cedars of Lebanon,
lofty and lifted up,
against all the oaks of Bashan"
Isaiah,2,14,"against all the high mountains,
against all the lofty hills"
Isaiah,2,15,"against every high tower,
against every fortified wall"
Isaiah,2,16,"against every ship of Tarshish,
and against every splendid sea vessel."
Isaiah,2,17,"The pride of mankind will be brought low,
and human loftiness will be humbled;
the LORD alone will be exalted on that day."
Isaiah,2,18,The worthless idols will vanish completely.
Isaiah,2,19,"People will go into caves in the rocks
and holes in the ground,
away from the terror of the LORD
and from his majestic splendor,
when he rises to terrify the earth."
Isaiah,2,20,"On that day people will throw
their worthless idols of silver and gold,
which they made to worship,
to the moles and the bats."
Isaiah,2,21,"They will go into the caves of the rocks
and the crevices in the cliffs,
away from the terror of the LORD
and from his majestic splendor,
when he rises to terrify the earth."
Isaiah,2,22,"Put no more trust in a mere human,
who has only the breath in his nostrils.
What is he really worth?"
Isaiah,3,1,"Note this: The Lord GOD of Armies
is about to remove from Jerusalem and from Judah
every kind of security:
the entire supply of bread and water"
Isaiah,3,2,"heroes and warriors,
judges and prophets,
fortune-tellers and elders"
Isaiah,3,3,"commanders of fifty and dignitaries,
counselors, cunning magicians, and necromancers."
Isaiah,3,4,"“I will make youths their leaders,
and unstable rulers will govern them.”"
Isaiah,3,5,"The people will oppress one another,
man against man, neighbor against neighbor;
the young will act arrogantly toward the old,
and the worthless toward the honorable."
Isaiah,3,6,"A man will even seize his brother
in his father’s house, saying,
“You have a cloak — you be our leader!
This heap of rubble will be under your control.”"
Isaiah,3,7,"On that day he will cry out, saying,
“I’m not a healer.
I don’t even have food or clothing in my house.
Don’t make me the leader of the people!”"
Isaiah,3,8,"For Jerusalem has stumbled
and Judah has fallen
because they have spoken and acted against the LORD,
defying his glorious presence."
Isaiah,3,9,"The look on their faces testifies against them,
and like Sodom, they flaunt their sin;
they do not conceal it.
Woe to them,
for they have brought disaster on themselves."
Isaiah,3,10,"Tell the righteous that it will go well for them,
for they will eat the fruit of their labor."
Isaiah,3,11,"Woe to the wicked — it will go badly for them,
for what they have done will be done to them."
Isaiah,3,12,"Youths oppress my people,
and women rule over them.
My people, your leaders mislead you;
they confuse the direction of your paths."
Isaiah,3,13,"The LORD rises to argue the case
and stands to judge the people."
Isaiah,3,14,"The LORD brings this charge
against the elders and leaders of his people:
“You have devastated the vineyard.
The plunder from the poor is in your houses."
Isaiah,3,15,"Why do you crush my people
and grind the faces of the poor?”
This is the declaration of the Lord GOD of Armies."
Isaiah,3,16,"The LORD also says:
Because the daughters of Zion are haughty,
walking with heads held high
and seductive eyes,
prancing along,
jingling their ankle bracelets"
Isaiah,3,17,"the Lord will put scabs on the heads
of the daughters of Zion,
and the LORD will shave their foreheads bare."
Isaiah,3,18,"On that day the Lord will strip their finery: ankle bracelets, headbands, crescents"
Isaiah,3,19,"pendants, bracelets, veils"
Isaiah,3,20,"headdresses, ankle jewelry, sashes, perfume bottles, amulets"
Isaiah,3,21,"signet rings, nose rings"
Isaiah,3,22,"festive robes, capes, cloaks, purses"
Isaiah,3,23,"garments, linen clothes, turbans, and shawls."
Isaiah,3,24,"Instead of perfume there will be a stench;
instead of a belt, a rope;
instead of beautifully styled hair, baldness;
instead of fine clothes, sackcloth;
instead of beauty, branding."
Isaiah,3,25,"Your men will fall by the sword,
your warriors in battle."
Isaiah,3,26,"Then her gates will lament and mourn;
deserted, she will sit on the ground."
Isaiah,4,1,"On that day seven women
will seize one man, saying,
“We will eat our own bread
and provide our own clothing.
Just let us bear your name.
Take away our disgrace.”"
Isaiah,4,2,"On that day the Branch of the LORD will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land will be the pride and glory of Israel’s survivors."
Isaiah,4,3,Whoever remains in Zion and whoever is left in Jerusalem will be called holy  — all in Jerusalem written in the book of life  
Isaiah,4,4,when the Lord has washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and cleansed the bloodguilt from the heart of Jerusalem by a spirit of judgment and a spirit of burning.
Isaiah,4,5,Then the LORD will create a cloud of smoke by day and a glowing flame of fire by night over the entire site of Mount Zion and over its assemblies. For there will be a canopy over all the glory
Isaiah,4,6,and there will be a shelter for shade from heat by day and a refuge and shelter from storm and rain.
Isaiah,5,1,"I will sing about the one I love,
a song about my loved one’s vineyard:
The one I love had a vineyard
on a very fertile hill."
Isaiah,5,2,"He broke up the soil, cleared it of stones,
and planted it with the finest vines.
He built a tower in the middle of it
and even dug out a winepress there.
He expected it to yield good grapes,
but it yielded worthless grapes."
Isaiah,5,3,"So now, residents of Jerusalem
and men of Judah,
please judge between me
and my vineyard."
Isaiah,5,4,"What more could I have done for my vineyard
than I did?
Why, when I expected a yield of good grapes,
did it yield worthless grapes?"
Isaiah,5,5,"Now I will tell you
what I am about to do to my vineyard:
I will remove its hedge,
and it will be consumed;
I will tear down its wall,
and it will be trampled."
Isaiah,5,6,"I will make it a wasteland.
It will not be pruned or weeded;
thorns and briers will grow up.
I will also give orders to the clouds
that rain should not fall on it."
Isaiah,5,7,"For the vineyard of the LORD of Armies
is the house of Israel,
and the men of Judah,
the plant he delighted in.
He expected justice
but saw injustice;
he expected righteousness
but heard cries of despair."
Isaiah,5,8,"Woe to those who add house to house
and join field to field
until there is no more room
and you alone are left in the land."
Isaiah,5,9,"I heard the LORD of Armies say:
Indeed, many houses will become desolate,
grand and lovely ones without inhabitants."
Isaiah,5,10,"For a ten-acre vineyard will yield
only six gallons of wine,
and ten bushels of seed will yield
only one bushel of grain."
Isaiah,5,11,"Woe to those who rise early in the morning
in pursuit of beer,
who linger into the evening,
inflamed by wine."
Isaiah,5,12,"At their feasts they have lyre, harp,
tambourine, flute, and wine.
They do not perceive the LORD’s actions,
and they do not see the work of his hands."
Isaiah,5,13,"Therefore my people will go into exile
because they lack knowledge;
her dignitaries are starving,
and her masses are parched with thirst."
Isaiah,5,14,"Therefore Sheol enlarges its throat
and opens wide its enormous jaws,
and down go Zion’s dignitaries, her masses,
her crowds, and those who celebrate in her!"
Isaiah,5,15,"Humanity is brought low, each person is humbled,
and haughty eyes are humbled."
Isaiah,5,16,"But the LORD of Armies is exalted by his justice,
and the holy God demonstrates his holiness through his righteousness."
Isaiah,5,17,"Lambs will graze
as if in their own pastures,
and resident aliens will eat
among the ruins of the rich."
Isaiah,5,18,"Woe to those who drag iniquity
with cords of deceit
and pull sin along with cart ropes"
Isaiah,5,19,"to those who say,
“Let him hurry up and do his work quickly
so that we can see it!
Let the plan of the Holy One of Israel take place
so that we can know it!”"
Isaiah,5,20,"Woe to those who call evil good
and good evil,
who substitute darkness for light
and light for darkness,
who substitute bitter for sweet
and sweet for bitter."
Isaiah,5,21,"Woe to those who consider themselves wise
and judge themselves clever."
Isaiah,5,22,"Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine,
who are champions at pouring beer"
Isaiah,5,23,"who acquit the guilty for a bribe
and deprive the innocent of justice."
Isaiah,5,24,"Therefore, as a tongue of fire consumes straw
and as dry grass shrivels in the flame,
so their roots will become like something rotten
and their blossoms will blow away like dust,
for they have rejected
the instruction of the LORD of Armies,
and they have despised
the word of the Holy One of Israel."
Isaiah,5,25,"Therefore the LORD’s anger burned against his people.
He raised his hand against them and struck them;
the mountains quaked,
and their corpses were like garbage in the streets.
In all this, his anger has not turned away,
and his hand is still raised to strike."
Isaiah,5,26,"He raises a signal flag for the distant nations
and whistles for them from the ends of the earth.
Look — how quickly and swiftly they come!"
Isaiah,5,27,"None of them grows weary or stumbles;
no one slumbers or sleeps.
No belt is loose
and no sandal strap broken."
Isaiah,5,28,"Their arrows are sharpened,
and all their bows strung.
Their horses’ hooves are like flint;
their chariot wheels are like a whirlwind."
Isaiah,5,29,"Their roaring is like a lion’s;
they roar like young lions;
they growl and seize their prey
and carry it off,
and no one can rescue it."
Isaiah,5,30,"On that day they will roar over it,
like the roaring of the sea.
When one looks at the land,
there will be darkness and distress;
light will be obscured by clouds."
Isaiah,6,1,"In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord seated on a high and lofty throne, and the hem of his robe filled the temple."
Isaiah,6,2,"Seraphim were standing above him; they each had six wings: with two they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they flew."
Isaiah,6,3,"And one called to another:
Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of Armies;
his glory fills the whole earth."
Isaiah,6,4,"The foundations of the doorways shook at the sound of their voices, and the temple was filled with smoke."
Isaiah,6,5,"Then I said:
Woe is me for I am ruined
because I am a man of unclean lips
and live among a people of unclean lips,
and because my eyes have seen the King,
the LORD of Armies."
Isaiah,6,6,"Then one of the seraphim flew to me, and in his hand was a glowing coal that he had taken from the altar with tongs."
Isaiah,6,7,"He touched my mouth with it and said:
Now that this has touched your lips,
your iniquity is removed
and your sin is atoned for."
Isaiah,6,8,"Then I heard the voice of the Lord asking:
Who will I send?
Who will go for us?
I said:
Here I am. Send me."
Isaiah,6,9,"And he replied:
Go! Say to these people:
Keep listening, but do not understand;
keep looking, but do not perceive."
Isaiah,6,10,"Make the minds of these people dull;
deafen their ears and blind their eyes;
otherwise they might see with their eyes
and hear with their ears,
understand with their minds,
turn back, and be healed."
Isaiah,6,11,"Then I said, “Until when, Lord?” And he replied:
Until cities lie in ruins without inhabitants,
houses are without people,
the land is ruined and desolate"
Isaiah,6,12,"and the LORD drives the people far away,
leaving great emptiness in the land."
Isaiah,6,13,"Though a tenth will remain in the land,
it will be burned again.
Like the terebinth or the oak
that leaves a stump when felled,
the holy seed is the stump."
Isaiah,7,1,"This took place during the reign of Ahaz, son of Jotham, son of Uzziah king of Judah: Aram’s King Rezin and Israel’s King Pekah son of Remaliah went to fight against Jerusalem, but they were not able to conquer it."
Isaiah,7,2,"When it became known to the house of David that Aram had occupied Ephraim, the heart of Ahaz and the hearts of his people trembled like trees of a forest shaking in the wind."
Isaiah,7,3,"The LORD said to Isaiah, “Go out with your son Shear-jashub to meet Ahaz at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, by the road to the Launderer’s Field."
Isaiah,7,4,"Say to him: Calm down and be quiet. Don’t be afraid or cowardly because of these two smoldering sticks, the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram, and the son of Remaliah."
Isaiah,7,5,"For Aram, along with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, has plotted harm against you. They say"
Isaiah,7,6,"‘Let’s go up against Judah, terrorize it, and conquer it for ourselves. Then we can install Tabeel’s son as king in it.’”"
Isaiah,7,7,"This is what the Lord GOD says:
It will not happen; it will not occur."
Isaiah,7,8,"The chief city of Aram is Damascus,
the chief of Damascus is Rezin
(within sixty-five years
Ephraim will be too shattered to be a people)"
Isaiah,7,9,"the chief city of Ephraim is Samaria,
and the chief of Samaria is the son of Remaliah.
If you do not stand firm in your faith,
then you will not stand at all."
Isaiah,7,10,Then the LORD spoke again to Ahaz
Isaiah,7,11,“Ask for a sign from the LORD your God — it can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven.”
Isaiah,7,12,"But Ahaz replied, “I will not ask. I will not test the LORD.”"
Isaiah,7,13,"Isaiah said, “Listen, house of David! Is it not enough for you to try the patience of men? Will you also try the patience of my God?"
Isaiah,7,14,"Therefore, the Lord himself will give you a sign: See, the virgin will conceive, have a son, and name him Immanuel."
Isaiah,7,15,"By the time he learns to reject what is bad and choose what is good, he will be eating curds and honey."
Isaiah,7,16,"For before the boy knows to reject what is bad and choose what is good, the land of the two kings you dread will be abandoned."
Isaiah,7,17,"The LORD will bring on you, your people, and your father’s house such a time as has never been since Ephraim separated from Judah: He will bring the king of Assyria.”"
Isaiah,7,18,"On that day
the LORD will whistle to flies
at the farthest streams of the Nile
and to bees in the land of Assyria."
Isaiah,7,19,"All of them will come and settle
in the steep ravines, in the clefts of the rocks,
in all the thornbushes, and in all the water holes."
Isaiah,7,20,"On that day the Lord will use a razor hired from beyond the Euphrates River — the king of Assyria  — to shave the hair on your heads, the hair on your legs, and even your beards."
Isaiah,7,21,"On that day
a man will raise a young cow and two sheep"
Isaiah,7,22,"and from the abundant milk they give
he will eat curds,
for every survivor in the land will eat curds and honey."
Isaiah,7,23,"And on that day
every place where there were a thousand vines,
worth a thousand pieces of silver,
will become thorns and briers."
Isaiah,7,24,"A man will go there with bow and arrows
because the whole land will be thorns and briers."
Isaiah,7,25,"You will not go to all the hills
that were once tilled with a hoe,
for fear of the thorns and briers.
Those hills will be places for oxen to graze
and for sheep to trample."
Isaiah,8,1,"Then the LORD said to me, “Take a large piece of parchment and write on it with an ordinary pen: Maher-shalal-hash-baz."
Isaiah,8,2,I have appointed trustworthy witnesses — the priest Uriah and Zechariah son of Jeberechiah.”
Isaiah,8,3,"I was then intimate with the prophetess, and she conceived and gave birth to a son. The LORD said to me, “Name him Maher-shalal-hash-baz"
Isaiah,8,4,"for before the boy knows how to call ‘Father,’ or ‘Mother,’ the wealth of Damascus and the spoils of Samaria will be carried off to the king of Assyria.”"
Isaiah,8,5,The LORD spoke to me again
Isaiah,8,6,"Because these people rejected
the slowly flowing water of Shiloah
and rejoiced with Rezin
and the son of Remaliah"
Isaiah,8,7,"the Lord will certainly bring against them
the mighty rushing water of the Euphrates River —
the king of Assyria and all his glory.
It will overflow its channels
and spill over all its banks."
Isaiah,8,8,"It will pour into Judah,
flood over it, and sweep through,
reaching up to the neck;
and its flooded banks
will fill your entire land, Immanuel!"
Isaiah,8,9,"Band together, peoples, and be broken;
pay attention, all you distant lands;
prepare for war, and be broken;
prepare for war, and be broken."
Isaiah,8,10,"Devise a plan; it will fail.
Make a prediction; it will not happen.
For God is with us."
Isaiah,8,11,"For this is what the LORD said to me with great power, to keep me from going the way of this people"
Isaiah,8,12,"Do not call everything a conspiracy
that these people say is a conspiracy.
Do not fear what they fear;
do not be terrified."
Isaiah,8,13,"You are to regard only the LORD of Armies as holy.
Only he should be feared;
only he should be held in awe."
Isaiah,8,14,"He will be a sanctuary;
but for the two houses of Israel,
he will be a stone to stumble over
and a rock to trip over,
and a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem."
Isaiah,8,15,"Many will stumble over these;
they will fall and be broken;
they will be snared and captured."
Isaiah,8,16,"Bind up the testimony.
Seal up the instruction among my disciples."
Isaiah,8,17,"I will wait for the LORD,
who is hiding his face from the house of Jacob.
I will wait for him."
Isaiah,8,18,Here I am with the children the LORD has given me to be signs and wonders in Israel from the LORD of Armies who dwells on Mount Zion.
Isaiah,8,19,"When they say to you, “Inquire of the mediums and the spiritists who chirp and mutter,” shouldn’t a people inquire of their God? Should they inquire of the dead on behalf of the living?"
Isaiah,8,20,"Go to God’s instruction and testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, there will be no dawn for them."
Isaiah,8,21,"They will wander through the land, dejected and hungry. When they are famished, they will become enraged, and, looking upward, will curse their king and their God."
Isaiah,8,22,"They will look toward the earth and see only distress, darkness, and the gloom of affliction, and they will be driven into thick darkness."
Isaiah,9,1,"Nevertheless, the gloom of the distressed land will not be like that of the former times when he humbled the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali. But in the future he will bring honor to the way of the sea, to the land east of the Jordan, and to Galilee of the nations."
Isaiah,9,2,"The people walking in darkness
have seen a great light;
a light has dawned
on those living in the land of darkness."
Isaiah,9,3,"You have enlarged the nation
and increased its joy.
The people have rejoiced before you
as they rejoice at harvest time
and as they rejoice when dividing spoils."
Isaiah,9,4,"For you have shattered their oppressive yoke
and the rod on their shoulders,
the staff of their oppressor,
just as you did on the day of Midian."
Isaiah,9,5,"For every trampling boot of battle
and the bloodied garments of war
will be burned as fuel for the fire."
Isaiah,9,6,"For a child will be born for us,
a son will be given to us,
and the government will be on his shoulders.
He will be named
Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,
Eternal Father, Prince of Peace."
Isaiah,9,7,"The dominion will be vast,
and its prosperity will never end.
He will reign on the throne of David
and over his kingdom,
to establish and sustain it
with justice and righteousness from now on and forever.
The zeal of the LORD of Armies will accomplish this."
Isaiah,9,8,"The Lord sent a message against Jacob;
it came against Israel."
Isaiah,9,9,"All the people —
Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria  — will know it.
They will say with pride and arrogance"
Isaiah,9,10,"“The bricks have fallen,
but we will rebuild with cut stones;
the sycamores have been cut down,
but we will replace them with cedars.”"
Isaiah,9,11,"The LORD has raised up Rezin’s adversaries against him
and stirred up his enemies."
Isaiah,9,12,"Aram from the east and Philistia from the west
have consumed Israel with open mouths.
In all this, his anger has not turned away,
and his hand is still raised to strike."
Isaiah,9,13,"The people did not turn to him who struck them;
they did not seek the LORD of Armies."
Isaiah,9,14,"So the LORD cut off Israel’s head and tail,
palm branch and reed in a single day."
Isaiah,9,15,"The head is the elder, the honored one;
the tail is the prophet, the one teaching lies."
Isaiah,9,16,"The leaders of the people mislead them,
and those they mislead are swallowed up."
Isaiah,9,17,"Therefore the Lord does not rejoice
over Israel’s young men
and has no compassion
on its fatherless and widows,
for everyone is a godless evildoer,
and every mouth speaks folly.
In all this, his anger has not turned away,
and his hand is still raised to strike."
Isaiah,9,18,"For wickedness burns like a fire
that consumes thorns and briers
and kindles the forest thickets
so that they go up in a column of smoke."
Isaiah,9,19,"The land is scorched
by the wrath of the LORD of Armies,
and the people are like fuel for the fire.
No one has compassion on his brother."

but they are still hungry;
they have eaten on the left,
but they are still not satisfied.
Each one eats the flesh of his arm."

He has turned my last glimmer of hope
into sheer terror."

let him report what he sees."

pairs of horsemen,
riders on donkeys,
riders on camels —
he must pay close attention.”"
Isaiah,21,8,"Then the lookout reported,
“Lord, I stand on the watchtower all day,
and I stay at my post all night."

Your dead did not die by the sword;
they were not killed in battle."

captured without a bow.
All your fugitives were captured together;
they had fled far away."

On that day you looked to the weapons in the House of the Forest."

Isaiah,22,10,You counted the houses of Jerusalem so that you could tear them down to fortify the wall.

Isaiah,22,24,"They will hang on him all the glory of his father’s family: the descendants and the offshoots — all the small vessels, from bowls to every kind of jar."
Isaiah,22,25,"On that day” — the declaration of the LORD of Armies — “the peg that was driven into a firm place will give way, be cut off, and fall, and the load on it will be destroyed.” Indeed, the LORD has spoken."

Word has reached them from the land of Cyprus."
Isaiah,23,2,"Mourn, inhabitants of the coastland,
you merchants of Sidon;
your agents have crossed the sea"

ravished young woman, daughter of Sidon.
Get up and cross over to Cyprus  —
even there you will have no rest!”"

because your fortress is destroyed!"
Isaiah,23,15,"On that day Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years — the life span of one king. At the end of seventy years, what the song says about the prostitute will happen to Tyre"

stroll through the city,
you forgotten prostitute.
Play skillfully,
sing many a song

the God of Israel."

who dwell on the earth."

a fortified city, into ruins;
the fortress of barbarians is no longer a city;
it will never be rebuilt."
Isaiah,25,3,"Therefore, a strong people will honor you.
The cities of violent nations will fear you."
Isaiah,25,4,"For you have been a stronghold for the poor person,
a stronghold for the needy in his distress,
a refuge from storms and a shade from heat.
When the breath of the violent
is like a storm against a wall"
Isaiah,25,5,"like heat in a dry land,
you will subdue the uproar of barbarians.
As the shade of a cloud cools the heat of the day,
so he will silence the song of the violent."

the steps of the poor."

yes, my spirit within me diligently seeks you,
for when your judgments are in the land,
the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness."

and does not see the majesty of the LORD."

writhes and cries out in her pains,
so we were before you, LORD."

we gave birth to wind.
We have won no victories on earth,
and the earth’s inhabitants have not fallen."

and close your doors behind you.
Hide for a little while until the wrath has passed."

make peace with me."

as he struck the one who struck Israel?
Was Israel killed like those killed by the LORD?"
Isaiah,27,8,"You disputed with Israel
by banishing and driving her away.
He removed her with his severe storm
on the day of the east wind."
Isaiah,27,9,"Therefore Jacob’s iniquity will be atoned for in this way,
and the result of the removal of his sin will be this:
when he makes all the altar stones
like crushed bits of chalk,
no Asherah poles or incense altars will remain standing."
Isaiah,27,10,"For the fortified city will be desolate,
pastures deserted and abandoned like a wilderness.
Calves will graze there,
and there they will spread out and strip its branches."
Isaiah,27,11,"When its branches dry out, they will be broken off.
Women will come and make fires with them,
for they are not a people with understanding.
Therefore their Maker will not have compassion on them,
and their Creator will not be gracious to them."

the LORD will thresh grain from the Euphrates River
as far as the Wadi of Egypt,
and you Israelites will be gathered one by one."

like a devastating hail storm,
like a storm with strong flooding water.
He will bring it across the land with his hand."
Isaiah,28,3,"The majestic crown of Ephraim’s drunkards
will be trampled underfoot."

while it is still in his hand."

the LORD of Armies will become a crown of beauty
and a diadem of splendor
to the remnant of his people"
Isaiah,28,6,"a spirit of justice
to the one who sits in judgment,
and strength
to those who repel attacks at the city gate."
Isaiah,28,7,"Even these stagger because of wine
and stumble under the influence of beer:
Priest and prophet stagger because of beer.
They are confused by wine.
They stumble because of beer.
They are muddled in their visions.
They stumble in their judgments."
Isaiah,28,8,"Indeed, all their tables are covered with vomit;
there is no place without a stench."
Isaiah,28,9,"Who is he trying to teach?
Who is he trying to instruct?
Infants just weaned from milk?
Babies removed from the breast?"
Isaiah,28,10,"“Law after law, law after law,
line after line, line after line,
a little here, a little there.”"
Isaiah,28,11,"For he will speak to this people
with stammering speech
and in a foreign language."
Isaiah,28,12,"He had said to them,
“This is the place of rest;
let the weary rest;
this is the place of repose.”
But they would not listen."
Isaiah,28,13,"The word of the LORD will come to them:
“Law after law, law after law,
line after line, line after line,
a little here, a little there,”
so they go stumbling backward,
to be broken, trapped, and captured."
Isaiah,28,14,"Therefore hear the word of the LORD, you scoffers
who rule this people in Jerusalem."
Isaiah,28,15,"For you said, “We have made a covenant with Death,
and we have an agreement with Sheol;
when the overwhelming catastrophe passes through,
it will not touch us,
because we have made falsehood our refuge
and have hidden behind treachery.”"
Isaiah,28,16,"Therefore the Lord GOD said:
“Look, I have laid a stone in Zion,
a tested stone,
a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation;
the one who believes will be unshakable."
Isaiah,28,17,"And I will make justice the measuring line
and righteousness the mason’s level.”
Hail will sweep away the false refuge,
and water will flood your hiding place."
Isaiah,28,18,"Your covenant with Death will be dissolved,
and your agreement with Sheol will not last.
When the overwhelming catastrophe passes through,
you will be trampled."
Isaiah,28,19,"Every time it passes through,
it will carry you away;
it will pass through every morning —
every day and every night.
Only terror will cause you
to understand the message."
Isaiah,28,20,"Indeed, the bed is too short to stretch out on,
and its cover too small to wrap up in."
Isaiah,28,21,"For the LORD will rise up as he did at Mount Perazim.
He will rise in wrath, as at the Valley of Gibeon,
to do his work, his unexpected work,
and to perform his task, his unfamiliar task."
Isaiah,28,22,"So now, do not scoff,
or your shackles will become stronger.
Indeed, I have heard from the Lord GOD of Armies
a decree of destruction for the whole land."
Isaiah,28,23,"Listen and hear my voice.
Pay attention and hear what I say."
Isaiah,28,24,"Does the plowman plow every day to plant seed?
Does he continuously break up and cultivate the soil?"
Isaiah,28,25,"When he has leveled its surface,
does he not then scatter black cumin and sow cumin?
He plants wheat in rows and barley in plots,
with spelt as their border."
Isaiah,28,26,"His God teaches him order;
he instructs him."
Isaiah,28,27,"Certainly black cumin is not threshed
with a threshing board,
and a cart wheel is not rolled over the cumin.
But black cumin is beaten out with a stick,
and cumin with a rod."
Isaiah,28,28,"Bread grain is crushed,
but is not threshed endlessly.
Though the wheel of the farmer’s cart rumbles,
his horses do not crush it."
Isaiah,28,29,"This also comes from the LORD of Armies.
He gives wondrous advice;
he gives great wisdom."
Isaiah,29,1,"Woe to Ariel, Ariel,
the city where David camped!
Continue year after year;
let the festivals recur."

I will besiege you with earth ramps,
and I will set up my siege towers against you."

you will speak from the ground,
and your words will come from low in the dust.
Your voice will be like that of a spirit from the ground;
your speech will whisper from the dust."
Isaiah,29,5,"Your many foes will be like fine dust,
and many of the ruthless, like blowing chaff.
Then suddenly, in an instant"
Isaiah,29,6,"you will be punished by the LORD of Armies
with thunder, earthquake, and loud noise,
storm, tempest, and a flame of consuming fire."
Isaiah,29,7,"All the many nations
going out to battle against Ariel —
all the attackers, the siege works against her,
and those who oppress her —
will then be like a dream, a vision in the night."
Isaiah,29,8,"It will be like a hungry one who dreams he is eating,
then wakes and is still hungry;
and like a thirsty one who dreams he is drinking,
then wakes and is still thirsty, longing for water.
So it will be for all the many nations
who go to battle against Mount Zion."
Isaiah,29,9,"Stop and be astonished;
blind yourselves and be blind!
They are drunk, but not with wine;
they stagger, but not with beer."
Isaiah,29,10,"For the LORD has poured out on you
an overwhelming urge to sleep;
he has shut your eyes (the prophets)
and covered your heads (the seers)."
Isaiah,29,11,"For you the entire vision will be like the words of a sealed document. If it is given to one who can read and he is asked to read it, he will say, “I can’t read it, because it is sealed.”"
Isaiah,29,12,"And if the document is given to one who cannot read and he is asked to read it, he will say, “I can’t read.”"
Isaiah,29,13,"The Lord said:
These people approach me with their speeches
to honor me with lip-service,
yet their hearts are far from me,
and human rules direct their worship of me."
Isaiah,29,14,"Therefore, I will again confound these people
with wonder after wonder.
The wisdom of their wise will vanish,
and the perception of their perceptive will be hidden."
Isaiah,29,15,"Woe to those who go to great lengths
to hide their plans from the LORD.
They do their works in the dark,
and say, “Who sees us? Who knows us?”"
Isaiah,29,16,"You have turned things around,
as if the potter were the same as the clay.
How can what is made say about its maker,
“He didn’t make me”?
How can what is formed
say about the one who formed it,
“He doesn’t understand what he’s doing”?"
Isaiah,29,17,"Isn’t it true that in just a little while
Lebanon will become an orchard,
and the orchard will seem like a forest?"
Isaiah,29,18,"On that day the deaf will hear
the words of a document,
and out of a deep darkness
the eyes of the blind will see."
Isaiah,29,19,"The humble will have joy
after joy in the LORD,
and the poor people will rejoice
in the Holy One of Israel."
Isaiah,29,20,"For the ruthless one will vanish,
the scorner will disappear,
and all those who lie in wait with evil intent
will be killed "
Isaiah,29,21,"those who, with their speech,
accuse a person of wrongdoing,
who set a trap for the one mediating at the city gate
and without cause deprive the righteous of justice."
Isaiah,29,22,"Therefore, the LORD who redeemed Abraham says this about the house of Jacob:
Jacob will no longer be ashamed,
and his face will no longer be pale."
Isaiah,29,23,"For when he sees his children,
the work of my hands within his nation,
they will honor my name,
they will honor the Holy One of Jacob
and stand in awe of the God of Israel."
Isaiah,29,24,"Those who are confused will gain understanding,
and those who grumble will accept instruction."
Isaiah,30,1,"Woe to the rebellious children!
This is the LORD’s declaration.
They carry out a plan, but not mine;
they make an alliance,
but against my will,
piling sin on top of sin."
Isaiah,30,2,"Without asking my advice
they set out to go down to Egypt
in order to seek shelter under Pharaoh’s protection
and take refuge in Egypt’s shadow."
Isaiah,30,3,"But Pharaoh’s protection will become your shame,
and refuge in Egypt’s shadow your humiliation."
Isaiah,30,4,"For though his princes are at Zoan
and his messengers reach as far as Hanes"
Isaiah,30,5,"everyone will be ashamed
because of a people who can’t help.
They are of no benefit, they are no help;
they are good for nothing but shame and disgrace."
Isaiah,30,6,"A pronouncement concerning the animals of the Negev:
Through a land of trouble and distress,
of lioness and lion,
of viper and flying serpent,
they carry their wealth on the backs of donkeys
and their treasures on the humps of camels,
to a people who will not help them."
Isaiah,30,7,"Egypt’s help is completely worthless;
therefore, I call her:
Rahab Who Just Sits."
Isaiah,30,8,"Go now, write it on a tablet in their presence
and inscribe it on a scroll;
it will be for the future,
forever and ever."
Isaiah,30,9,"They are a rebellious people,
deceptive children,
children who do not want to listen to the LORD’s instruction."
Isaiah,30,10,"They say to the seers, “Do not see,”
and to the prophets,
“Do not prophesy the truth to us.
Tell us flattering things.
Prophesy illusions."
Isaiah,30,11,"Get out of the way!
Leave the pathway.
Rid us of the Holy One of Israel.”"
Isaiah,30,12,"Therefore the Holy One of Israel says:
“Because you have rejected this message
and have trusted in oppression and deceit,
and have depended on them"
Isaiah,30,13,"this iniquity of yours will be
like a crumbling gap,
a bulge in a high wall
whose collapse will come in an instant — suddenly!"
Isaiah,30,14,"Its collapse will be like the shattering
of a potter’s jar, crushed to pieces,
so that not even a fragment of pottery
will be found among its shattered remains —
no fragment large enough to take fire from a hearth
or scoop water from a cistern.”"
Isaiah,30,15,"For the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel, has said:
“You will be delivered by returning and resting;
your strength will lie in quiet confidence.
But you are not willing.”"
Isaiah,30,16,"You say, “No!
We will escape on horses” —
therefore you will escape! —
and, “We will ride on fast horses” —
but those who pursue you will be faster."
Isaiah,30,17,"One thousand will flee at the threat of one,
at the threat of five you will flee,
until you remain
like a solitary pole on a mountaintop
or a banner on a hill."
Isaiah,30,18,"Therefore the LORD is waiting to show you mercy,
and is rising up to show you compassion,
for the LORD is a just God.
All who wait patiently for him are happy."
Isaiah,30,19,"For people will live on Zion in Jerusalem. You will never weep again; he will show favor to you at the sound of your outcry; as soon as he hears, he will answer you."
Isaiah,30,20,"The Lord will give you meager bread and water during oppression, but your Teacher will not hide any longer. Your eyes will see your Teacher"
Isaiah,30,21,"and whenever you turn to the right or to the left, your ears will hear this command behind you: “This is the way. Walk in it.”"
Isaiah,30,22,"Then you will defile your silver-plated idols and your gold-plated images. You will throw them away like menstrual cloths, and call them filth."
Isaiah,30,23,"Then he will send rain for your seed that you have sown in the ground, and the food, the produce of the ground, will be rich and plentiful. On that day your cattle will graze in open pastures."
Isaiah,30,24,The oxen and donkeys that work the ground will eat salted fodder scattered with winnowing shovel and fork.
Isaiah,30,25,Streams flowing with water will be on every high mountain and every raised hill on the day of great slaughter when the towers fall.
Isaiah,30,26,"The moonlight will be as bright as the sunlight, and the sunlight will be seven times brighter  — like the light of seven days — on the day that the LORD bandages his people’s injuries and heals the wounds he inflicted."
Isaiah,30,27,"Look! The name of the LORD is coming from far away,
his anger burning and heavy with smoke.
His lips are full of fury,
and his tongue is like a consuming fire."
Isaiah,30,28,"His breath is like an overflowing torrent
that rises to the neck.
He comes to sift the nations in a sieve of destruction
and to put a bridle on the jaws of the peoples
to lead them astray."
Isaiah,30,29,"Your singing will be like that
on the night of a holy festival,
and your heart will rejoice
like one who walks to the music of a flute,
going up to the mountain of the LORD,
to the Rock of Israel."
Isaiah,30,30,"And the LORD will make the splendor of his voice heard
and reveal his arm striking in angry wrath
and a flame of consuming fire,
in driving rain, a torrent, and hailstones."
Isaiah,30,31,"Assyria will be shattered by the voice of the LORD.
He will strike with a rod."
Isaiah,30,32,"And every stroke of the appointed staff
that the LORD brings down on him
will be to the sound of tambourines and lyres;
he will fight against him with brandished weapons."
Isaiah,30,33,"Indeed! Topheth has been ready
for the king for a long time.
Its funeral pyre is deep and wide,
with plenty of fire and wood.
The breath of the LORD, like a torrent of burning sulfur,
kindles it."
Isaiah,31,1,"Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help
and who depend on horses!
They trust in the abundance of chariots
and in the large number of horsemen.
They do not look to the Holy One of Israel,
and they do not seek the LORD."
Isaiah,31,2,"But he also is wise and brings disaster.
He does not go back on what he says;
he will rise up against the house of the wicked
and against the allies of evildoers."
Isaiah,31,3,"Egyptians are men, not God;
their horses are flesh, not spirit.
When the LORD raises his hand to strike,
the helper will stumble
and the one who is helped will fall;
both will perish together."
Isaiah,31,4,"For this is what the LORD said to me:
As a lion or young lion growls over its prey
when a band of shepherds is called out against it,
and it is not terrified by their shouting
or subdued by their noise,
so the LORD of Armies will come down
to fight on Mount Zion
and on its hill."
Isaiah,31,5,"Like hovering birds,
so the LORD of Armies will protect Jerusalem;
by protecting it, he will rescue it;
by passing over it, he will deliver it."
Isaiah,31,6,Return to the one the Israelites have greatly rebelled against.
Isaiah,31,7,"For on that day, every one of you will reject the worthless idols of silver and gold that your own hands have sinfully made."
Isaiah,31,8,"Then Assyria will fall,
but not by human sword;
a sword will devour him,
but not one made by man.
He will flee from the sword;
his young men will be put to forced labor."
Isaiah,31,9,"His rock will pass away because of fear,
and his officers will be afraid because of the signal flag.
This is the LORD’s declaration — whose fire is in Zion and whose furnace is in Jerusalem."
Isaiah,32,1,"Indeed, a king will reign righteously,
and rulers will rule justly."
Isaiah,32,2,"Each will be like a shelter from the wind,
a refuge from the rain,
like flowing streams in a dry land
and the shade of a massive rock in an arid land."
Isaiah,32,3,"Then the eyes of those who see will not be closed,
and the ears of those who hear will listen."
Isaiah,32,4,"The reckless mind will gain knowledge,
and the stammering tongue will speak clearly and fluently."
Isaiah,32,5,"A fool will no longer be called a noble,
nor a scoundrel said to be important."
Isaiah,32,6,"For a fool speaks foolishness
and his mind plots iniquity.
He lives in a godless way
and speaks falsely about the LORD.
He leaves the hungry empty
and deprives the thirsty of drink."
Isaiah,32,7,"The scoundrel’s weapons are destructive;
he hatches plots to destroy the needy with lies,
even when the poor person says what is right."
Isaiah,32,8,"But a noble person plans noble things;
he stands up for noble causes."
Isaiah,32,9,"Stand up, you complacent women;
listen to me.
Pay attention to what I say,
you overconfident daughters."
Isaiah,32,10,"In a little more than a year
you overconfident ones will shudder,
for the grapes will fail
and the harvest will not come."
Isaiah,32,11,"Shudder, you complacent ones;
tremble, you overconfident ones!
Strip yourselves bare
and put sackcloth around your waists."
Isaiah,32,12,"Beat your breasts in mourning
for the delightful fields and the fruitful vines"
Isaiah,32,13,"for the ground of my people
growing thorns and briers,
indeed, for every joyous house in the jubilant city."
Isaiah,32,14,"For the palace will be deserted,
the busy city abandoned.
The hill and the watchtower will become
barren places forever,
the joy of wild donkeys,
and a pasture for flocks"
Isaiah,32,15,"until the Spirit from on high is poured out on us.
Then the desert will become an orchard,
and the orchard will seem like a forest."
Isaiah,32,16,"Then justice will inhabit the wilderness,
and righteousness will dwell in the orchard."
Isaiah,32,17,"The result of righteousness will be peace;
the effect of righteousness
will be quiet confidence forever."
Isaiah,32,18,"Then my people will dwell in a peaceful place,
in safe and secure dwellings."
Isaiah,32,19,"But hail will level the forest,
and the city will sink into the depths."
Isaiah,32,20,"You will be happy as you sow seed
beside abundant water,
and as you let oxen and donkeys range freely."
Isaiah,33,1,"Woe, you destroyer never destroyed,
you traitor never betrayed!
When you have finished destroying,
you will be destroyed.
When you have finished betraying,
they will betray you."
Isaiah,33,2,"LORD, be gracious to us! We wait for you.
Be our strength every morning
and our salvation in time of trouble."
Isaiah,33,3,"The peoples flee at the thunderous noise;
the nations scatter when you rise in your majesty."
Isaiah,33,4,"Your spoil will be gathered as locusts are gathered;
people will swarm over it like an infestation of locusts."
Isaiah,33,5,"The LORD is exalted, for he dwells on high;
he has filled Zion with justice and righteousness."
Isaiah,33,6,"There will be times of security for you —
a storehouse of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge.
The fear of the LORD is Zion’s treasure."
Isaiah,33,7,"Listen! Their warriors cry loudly in the streets;
the messengers of peace weep bitterly."
Isaiah,33,8,"The highways are deserted;
travel has ceased.
An agreement has been broken,
cities despised,
and human life disregarded."
Isaiah,33,9,"The land mourns and withers;
Lebanon is ashamed and wilted.
Sharon is like a desert;
Bashan and Carmel shake off their leaves."
Isaiah,33,10,"“Now I will rise up,” says the LORD.
“Now I will lift myself up.
Now I will be exalted."
Isaiah,33,11,"You will conceive chaff;
you will give birth to stubble.
Your breath is fire that will consume you."
Isaiah,33,12,"The peoples will be burned to ashes,
like thorns cut down and burned in a fire."
Isaiah,33,13,"You who are far off, hear what I have done;
you who are near, know my strength.”"
Isaiah,33,14,"The sinners in Zion are afraid;
trembling seizes the ungodly:
“Who among us can dwell with a consuming fire?
Who among us can dwell with ever-burning flames?”"
Isaiah,33,15,"The one who lives righteously
and speaks rightly,
who refuses profit from extortion,
whose hand never takes a bribe,
who stops his ears from listening to murderous plots
and shuts his eyes against evil schemes  "
Isaiah,33,16,"he will dwell on the heights;
his refuge will be the rocky fortresses,
his food provided, his water assured."
Isaiah,33,17,"Your eyes will see the King in his beauty;
you will see a vast land."
Isaiah,33,18,"Your mind will meditate on the past terror:
“Where is the accountant?
Where is the tribute collector?
Where is the one who spied out our defenses?”"
Isaiah,33,19,"You will no longer see the barbarians,
a people whose speech is difficult to comprehend —
who stammer in a language that is not understood."
Isaiah,33,20,"Look at Zion, the city of our festival times.
Your eyes will see Jerusalem,
a peaceful pasture, a tent that does not wander;
its tent pegs will not be pulled up
nor will any of its cords be loosened."
Isaiah,33,21,"For the majestic one, our LORD, will be there,
a place of rivers and broad streams
where ships that are rowed will not go,
and majestic vessels will not pass."
Isaiah,33,22,"For the LORD is our Judge,
the LORD is our Lawgiver,
the LORD is our King.
He will save us."
Isaiah,33,23,"Your ropes are slack;
they cannot hold the base of the mast
or spread out the flag.
Then abundant spoil will be divided,
the lame will plunder it"
Isaiah,33,24,"and none there will say, “I am sick.”
The people who dwell there
will be forgiven their iniquity."
Isaiah,34,1,"You nations, come here and listen;
you peoples, pay attention!
Let the earth and all that fills it hear,
the world and all that comes from it."
Isaiah,34,2,"The LORD is angry with all the nations,
furious with all their armies.
He will set them apart for destruction,
giving them over to slaughter."
Isaiah,34,3,"Their slain will be thrown out,
and the stench of their corpses will rise;
the mountains will flow with their blood."
Isaiah,34,4,"All the stars in the sky will dissolve.
The sky will roll up like a scroll,
and its stars will all wither
as leaves wither on the vine,
and foliage on the fig tree."
Isaiah,34,5,"When my sword has drunk its fill in the heavens,
it will then come down on Edom
and on the people I have set apart for destruction."
Isaiah,34,6,"The LORD’s sword is covered with blood.
It drips with fat,
with the blood of lambs and goats,
with the fat of the kidneys of rams.
For the LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah,
a great slaughter in the land of Edom."
Isaiah,34,7,"The wild oxen will be struck down with them,
and young bulls with the mighty bulls.
Their land will be soaked with blood,
and their soil will be saturated with fat."
Isaiah,34,8,"For the LORD has a day of vengeance,
a time of paying back Edom
for its hostility against Zion."
Isaiah,34,9,"Edom’s streams will be turned into pitch,
her soil into sulfur;
her land will become burning pitch."
Isaiah,34,10,"It will never go out — day or night.
Its smoke will go up forever.
It will be desolate, from generation to generation;
no one will pass through it forever and ever."
Isaiah,34,11,"Eagle owls and herons will possess it,
and long-eared owls and ravens will dwell there.
The LORD will stretch out a measuring line
and a plumb line over her
for her destruction and chaos."
Isaiah,34,12,"No nobles will be left to proclaim a king,
and all her princes will come to nothing."
Isaiah,34,13,"Her palaces will be overgrown with thorns;
her fortified cities, with thistles and briers.
She will become a dwelling for jackals,
an abode for ostriches."
Isaiah,34,14,"The desert creatures will meet hyenas,
and one wild goat will call to another.
Indeed, the night birds will stay there
and will find a resting place."
Isaiah,34,15,"Sand partridges will make their nests there;
they will lay and hatch their eggs
and will gather their broods under their shadows.
Indeed, the birds of prey will gather there,
each with its mate."
Isaiah,34,16,"Search and read the scroll of the LORD:
Not one of them will be missing,
none will be lacking its mate,
because he has ordered it by my mouth,
and he will gather them by his Spirit."
Isaiah,34,17,"He has cast the lot for them;
his hand allotted their portion with a measuring line.
They will possess it forever;
they will dwell in it from generation to generation."
Isaiah,35,1,"The wilderness and the dry land will be glad;
the desert will rejoice and blossom like a wildflower."
Isaiah,35,2,"It will blossom abundantly
and will also rejoice with joy and singing.
The glory of Lebanon will be given to it,
the splendor of Carmel and Sharon.
They will see the glory of the LORD,
the splendor of our God."
Isaiah,35,3,"Strengthen the weak hands,
steady the shaking knees!"
Isaiah,35,4,"Say to the cowardly:
“Be strong; do not fear!
Here is your God; vengeance is coming.
God’s retribution is coming; he will save you.”"
Isaiah,35,5,"Then the eyes of the blind will be opened,
and the ears of the deaf unstopped."
Isaiah,35,6,"Then the lame will leap like a deer,
and the tongue of the mute will sing for joy,
for water will gush in the wilderness,
and streams in the desert"
Isaiah,35,7,"the parched ground will become a pool,
and the thirsty land, springs.
In the haunt of jackals, in their lairs,
there will be grass, reeds, and papyrus."
Isaiah,35,8,"A road will be there and a way;
it will be called the Holy Way.
The unclean will not travel on it,
but it will be for the one who walks the path.
Fools will not wander on it."
Isaiah,35,9,"There will be no lion there,
and no vicious beast will go up on it;
they will not be found there.
But the redeemed will walk on it"
Isaiah,35,10,"and the ransomed of the LORD will return
and come to Zion with singing,
crowned with unending joy.
Joy and gladness will overtake them,
and sorrow and sighing will flee."
Isaiah,36,1,"In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, King Sennacherib of Assyria attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them."
Isaiah,36,2,"Then the king of Assyria sent his royal spokesman, along with a massive army, from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. The Assyrian stood near the conduit of the upper pool, by the road to Launderer’s Field."
Isaiah,36,3,"Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the court secretary, and Joah son of Asaph, the court historian, came out to him."
Isaiah,36,4,"The royal spokesman said to them, “Tell Hezekiah:
The great king, the king of Assyria, says this: What are you relying on?"
Isaiah,36,5,You think mere words are strategy and strength for war. Who are you now relying on that you have rebelled against me?
Isaiah,36,6,"Look, you are relying on Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff that will pierce the hand of anyone who grabs it and leans on it. This is how Pharaoh king of Egypt is to all who rely on him."
Isaiah,36,7,"Suppose you say to me, ‘We rely on the LORD our God.’ Isn’t he the one whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, ‘You are to worship at this altar’?"
Isaiah,36,8,"“Now make a deal with my master, the king of Assyria. I’ll give you two thousand horses if you’re able to supply riders for them!"
Isaiah,36,9,How then can you drive back a single officer among the least of my master’s servants? How can you rely on Egypt for chariots and horsemen?
Isaiah,36,10,"Have I attacked this land to destroy it without the LORD’s approval? The LORD said to me, ‘Attack this land and destroy it.’”"
Isaiah,36,11,"Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to the royal spokesman, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, since we understand it. Don’t speak to us in Hebrew within earshot of the people who are on the wall.”"
Isaiah,36,12,"But the royal spokesman replied, “Has my master sent me to speak these words to your master and to you, and not to the men who are sitting on the wall, who are destined with you to eat their own excrement and drink their own urine?”"
Isaiah,36,13,"Then the royal spokesman stood and called out loudly in Hebrew:
Listen to the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!"
Isaiah,36,14,"This is what the king says: “Don’t let Hezekiah deceive you, for he cannot rescue you."
Isaiah,36,15,"Don’t let Hezekiah persuade you to rely on the LORD, saying, ‘The LORD will certainly rescue us! This city will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.’”"
Isaiah,36,16,"Don’t listen to Hezekiah, for this is what the king of Assyria says: “Make peace with me and surrender to me. Then every one of you may eat from his own vine and his own fig tree and drink water from his own cistern"
Isaiah,36,17,"until I come and take you away to a land like your own land — a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards."
Isaiah,36,18,"Beware that Hezekiah does not mislead you by saying, ‘The LORD will rescue us.’ Has any one of the gods of the nations rescued his land from the power of the king of Assyria?"
Isaiah,36,19,Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they rescued Samaria from my power?
Isaiah,36,20,Who among all the gods of these lands ever rescued his land from my power? So will the LORD rescue Jerusalem from my power?”
Isaiah,36,21,"But they kept silent; they didn’t say anything, for the king’s command was, “Don’t answer him.”"
Isaiah,36,22,"Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the court secretary, and Joah son of Asaph, the court historian, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn and reported to him the words of the royal spokesman."
Isaiah,37,1,"When King Hezekiah heard their report, he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth, and went to the LORD’s temple."
Isaiah,37,2,"He sent Eliakim, who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the court secretary, and the leading priests, who were covered with sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz."
Isaiah,37,3,"They said to him, “This is what Hezekiah says: ‘Today is a day of distress, rebuke, and disgrace. It is as if children have come to the point of birth, and there is no strength to deliver them."
Isaiah,37,4,"Perhaps the LORD your God will hear all the words of the royal spokesman, whom his master the king of Assyria sent to mock the living God, and will rebuke him for the words that the LORD your God has heard. Therefore offer a prayer for the surviving remnant.’”"
Isaiah,37,5,So the servants of King Hezekiah went to Isaiah
Isaiah,37,6,"who said to them, “Tell your master, ‘The LORD says this: Don’t be afraid because of the words you have heard, with which the king of Assyria’s attendants have blasphemed me."
Isaiah,37,7,"I am about to put a spirit in him and he will hear a rumor and return to his own land, where I will cause him to fall by the sword.’”"
Isaiah,37,8,"When the royal spokesman heard that the king of Assyria had pulled out of Lachish, he left and found him fighting against Libnah."
Isaiah,37,9,"The king had heard concerning King Tirhakah of Cush, “He has set out to fight against you.” So when he heard this, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying"
Isaiah,37,10,"“Say this to King Hezekiah of Judah: ‘Don’t let your God, on whom you rely, deceive you by promising that Jerusalem won’t be handed over to the king of Assyria."
Isaiah,37,11,"Look, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the countries: they completely destroyed them. Will you be rescued?"
Isaiah,37,12,"Did the gods of the nations that my predecessors destroyed rescue them — Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the Edenites in Telassar?"
Isaiah,37,13,"Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, or Ivvah? ’”"
Isaiah,37,14,"Hezekiah took the letter from the messengers’ hands, read it, then went up to the LORD’s temple and spread it out before the LORD."
Isaiah,37,15,Then Hezekiah prayed to the LORD
Isaiah,37,16,"LORD of Armies, God of Israel, enthroned between the cherubim, you are God  — you alone  — of all the kingdoms of the earth. You made the heavens and the earth."
Isaiah,37,17,"Listen closely, LORD, and hear; open your eyes, LORD, and see. Hear all the words that Sennacherib has sent to mock the living God."
Isaiah,37,18,"LORD, it is true that the kings of Assyria have devastated all these countries and their lands."
Isaiah,37,19,"They have thrown their gods into the fire, for they were not gods but made from wood and stone by human hands. So they have destroyed them."
Isaiah,37,20,"Now, LORD our God, save us from his power so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you, LORD, are God  — you alone."
Isaiah,37,21,"Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah: “The LORD, the God of Israel, says, ‘Because you prayed to me about King Sennacherib of Assyria"
Isaiah,37,22,"this is the word the LORD has spoken against him:
Virgin Daughter Zion
despises you and scorns you;
Daughter Jerusalem shakes her head
behind your back."
Isaiah,37,23,"Who is it you have mocked and blasphemed?
Against whom have you raised your voice
and lifted your eyes in pride?
Against the Holy One of Israel!"
Isaiah,37,24,"You have mocked the Lord through your servants.
You have said, “With my many chariots
I have gone up to the heights of the mountains,
to the far recesses of Lebanon.
I cut down its tallest cedars,
its choice cypress trees.
I came to its distant heights,
its densest forest."
Isaiah,37,25,"I dug wells and drank water in foreign lands.
I dried up all the streams of Egypt
with the soles of my feet.”"
Isaiah,37,26,"Have you not heard?
I designed it long ago;
I planned it in days gone by.
I have now brought it to pass,
and you have crushed fortified cities
into piles of rubble."
Isaiah,37,27,"Their inhabitants have become powerless,
dismayed, and ashamed.
They are plants of the field,
tender grass,
grass on the rooftops,
blasted by the east wind."
Isaiah,37,28,"But I know your sitting down,
your going out and your coming in,
and your raging against me."
Isaiah,37,29,"Because your raging against me
and your arrogance have reached my ears,
I will put my hook in your nose
and my bit in your mouth;
I will make you go back
the way you came."
Isaiah,37,30,"“‘This will be the sign for you: This year you will eat what grows on its own, and in the second year what grows from that. But in the third year sow and reap, plant vineyards and eat their fruit."
Isaiah,37,31,The surviving remnant of the house of Judah will again take root downward and bear fruit upward.
Isaiah,37,32,"For a remnant will go out from Jerusalem, and survivors from Mount Zion. The zeal of the LORD of Armies will accomplish this.’"
Isaiah,37,33,"“Therefore, this is what the LORD says about the king of Assyria:
He will not enter this city,
shoot an arrow here,
come before it with a shield,
or build up a siege ramp against it."
Isaiah,37,34,"He will go back
the way he came,
and he will not enter this city.
This is the LORD’s declaration."
Isaiah,37,35,"I will defend this city and rescue it
for my sake
and for the sake of my servant David.”"
Isaiah,37,36,"Then the angel of the LORD went out and struck down one hundred eighty-five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians. When the people got up the next morning, there were all the dead bodies!"
Isaiah,37,37,So King Sennacherib of Assyria broke camp and left. He returned home and lived in Nineveh.
Isaiah,37,38,"One day, while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him down with the sword and escaped to the land of Ararat. Then his son Esar-haddon became king in his place."
Isaiah,38,1,"In those days Hezekiah became terminally ill. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz came and said to him, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Set your house in order, for you are about to die; you will not recover.’”"
Isaiah,38,2,Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD.
Isaiah,38,3,"He said, “Please, LORD, remember how I have walked before you faithfully and wholeheartedly, and have done what pleases you.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly."
Isaiah,38,4,Then the word of the LORD came to Isaiah
Isaiah,38,5,"“Go and tell Hezekiah, ‘This is what the LORD God of your ancestor David says: I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears. Look, I am going to add fifteen years to your life."
Isaiah,38,6,And I will rescue you and this city from the grasp of the king of Assyria; I will defend this city.
Isaiah,38,7,This is the sign to you from the LORD that he will do what he has promised
Isaiah,38,8,I am going to make the sun’s shadow that goes down on the stairway of Ahaz go back by ten steps.’” So the sun’s shadow went back the ten steps it had descended.
Isaiah,38,9,A poem by King Hezekiah of Judah after he had been sick and had recovered from his illness
Isaiah,38,10,"I said: In the prime of my life
I must go to the gates of Sheol;
I am deprived of the rest of my years."
Isaiah,38,11,"I said: I will never see the LORD,
the LORD in the land of the living;
I will not look on humanity any longer
with the inhabitants of what is passing away."
Isaiah,38,12,"My dwelling is plucked up and removed from me
like a shepherd’s tent.
I have rolled up my life like a weaver;
he cuts me off from the loom.
By nightfall you make an end of me."
Isaiah,38,13,"I thought until the morning:
He will break all my bones like a lion.
By nightfall you make an end of me."
Isaiah,38,14,"I chirp like a swallow or a crane;
I moan like a dove.
My eyes grow weak looking upward.
Lord, I am oppressed; support me."
Isaiah,38,15,"What can I say?
He has spoken to me,
and he himself has done it.
I walk along slowly all my years
because of the bitterness of my soul."
Isaiah,38,16,"Lord, by such things people live,
and in every one of them my spirit finds life;
you have restored me to health
and let me live."
Isaiah,38,17,"Indeed, it was for my own well-being
that I had such intense bitterness;
but your love has delivered me
from the Pit of destruction,
for you have thrown all my sins behind your back."
Isaiah,38,18,"For Sheol cannot thank you;
Death cannot praise you.
Those who go down to the Pit
cannot hope for your faithfulness."
Isaiah,38,19,"The living, only the living can thank you,
as I do today;
a father will make your faithfulness known to children."
Isaiah,38,20,"The LORD is ready to save me;
we will play stringed instruments
all the days of our lives
at the house of the LORD."
Isaiah,38,21,"Now Isaiah had said, “Let them take a lump of pressed figs and apply it to his infected skin, so that he may recover.”"
Isaiah,38,22,"And Hezekiah had asked, “What is the sign that I will go up to the LORD’s temple?”"
Isaiah,39,1,"At that time Merodach-baladan son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah since he heard that he had been sick and had recovered."
Isaiah,39,2,"Hezekiah was pleased with the letters, and he showed the envoys his treasure house — the silver, the gold, the spices, and the precious oil — and all his armory, and everything that was found in his treasuries. There was nothing in his palace and in all his realm that Hezekiah did not show them."
Isaiah,39,3,"Then the prophet Isaiah came to King Hezekiah and asked him, “What did these men say, and where did they come to you from?”
Hezekiah replied, “They came to me from a distant country, from Babylon.”"
Isaiah,39,4,"Isaiah asked, “What have they seen in your palace?”
Hezekiah answered, “They have seen everything in my palace. There isn’t anything in my treasuries that I didn’t show them.”"
Isaiah,39,5,"Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the LORD of Armies"
Isaiah,39,6,"‘Look, the days are coming when everything in your palace and all that your predecessors have stored up until today will be carried off to Babylon; nothing will be left,’ says the LORD."
Isaiah,39,7,"‘Some of your descendants — who come from you, whom you father — will be taken away, and they will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.’”"
Isaiah,39,8,"Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The word of the LORD that you have spoken is good,” for he thought: There will be peace and security during my lifetime."

the uneven ground will become smooth
and the rough places, a plain."

and all humanity together will see it,
for the mouth of the LORD has spoken."

Another said, “What should I cry out?”

and all its goodness is like the flower of the field."
Isaiah,40,7,"The grass withers, the flowers fade

indeed, the people are grass."
Isaiah,40,8,"The grass withers, the flowers fade,
but the word of our God remains forever.”"

Isaiah,40,18,"With whom will you compare God?
What likeness will you set up for comparison with him?"
Isaiah,40,19,"An idol? — something that a smelter casts
and a metalworker plates with gold
and makes silver chains for?"
Isaiah,40,20,"A poor person contributes wood for a pedestal
that will not rot.
He looks for a skilled craftsman
to set up an idol that will not fall over."

not one of them is missing."

Anyone who chooses you is detestable."

like a potter who treads the clay."
Isaiah,41,26,"Who told about this from the beginning,

no one told it,
no one heard your words."

to dwell in a temple."

or he takes a cypress or an oak.
He lets it grow strong among the trees of the forest.
He plants a laurel, and the rain makes it grow."
Isaiah,44,15,"A person can use it for fuel.
He takes some of it and warms himself;
also he kindles a fire and bakes bread;

He eats the roast and is satisfied.
He warms himself and says, “Ah!
I am warm, I see the blaze.”"

and cannot understand,
for he has shut their eyes so they cannot see,
and their minds so they cannot understand."
Isaiah,44,19,"No one comes to his senses;
no one has the perception or insight to say,
“I burned half of it in the fire,
I also baked bread on its coals,
I roasted meat and ate.
Should I make something detestable with the rest of it?
Should I bow down to a block of wood?”"

‘What are you fathering?’
or to his mother,
‘What are you giving birth to? ’”"

the Holy One of Israel and its Maker, says:

“The products of Egypt and the merchandise of Cush
and the Sabeans, men of stature,
will come over to you
and will be yours;
they will follow you,
they will come over in chains
and bow down to you.
They will confess to you,

the God who formed the earth and made it,
the one who established it
(he did not create it to be a wasteland,
but formed it to be inhabited)  —
he says, “I am the LORD,
and there is no other."
Isaiah,45,19,"I have not spoken in secret,
somewhere in a land of darkness.
I did not say to the descendants of Jacob:
Seek me in a wasteland.
I am the LORD, who speaks righteously,
who declares what is right."
Isaiah,45,20,"“Come, gather together,
and approach, you fugitives of the nations.
Those who carry their wooden idols
and pray to a god who cannot save
have no knowledge."
Isaiah,45,21,"Speak up and present your case  —
yes, let them consult each other.
Who predicted this long ago?
Who announced it from ancient times?
Was it not I, the LORD?
There is no other God but me,

will be justified and boast in the LORD."

and weigh out silver on scales —
they hire a goldsmith and he makes it into a god.
Then they kneel and bow down to it."
Isaiah,46,7,"They lift it to their shoulder and bear it along;
they set it in its place, and there it stands;

my splendor in Israel."

Virgin Daughter Babylon.
Sit on the ground without a throne,
Daughter Chaldea!
For you will no longer be called pampered and spoiled."

remove your veil,
strip off your skirt, bare your thigh,
wade through the streams."

sit in silence and go into darkness.
For you will no longer be called mistress of kingdoms."

I profaned my possession,
and I handed them over to you.
You showed them no mercy;
you made your yoke very heavy on the elderly."
Isaiah,47,7,"You said, ‘I will be the queen forever.’
You did not take these things to heart
or think about their outcome."
Isaiah,47,8,"“So now hear this, lover of luxury,
who sits securely,
who says to herself,
‘I am, and there is no one else.
I will never be a widow
or know the loss of children.’"
Isaiah,47,9,"These two things will happen to you
suddenly, in one day:
loss of children and widowhood.
They will happen to you in their entirety,
in spite of your many sorceries
and the potency of your spells."
Isaiah,47,10,"You were secure in your wickedness;
you said, ‘No one sees me.’
Your wisdom and knowledge
led you astray.
You said to yourself,
‘I am, and there is no one else.’"
Isaiah,47,11,"But disaster will happen to you;
you will not know how to avert it.
And it will fall on you,
but you will be unable to ward it off.
Devastation will happen to you suddenly

which you have wearied yourself with from your youth.
Perhaps you will be able to succeed;
perhaps you will inspire terror!"

So let the astrologers stand and save you —
those who observe the stars,
those who predict monthly
what will happen to you."
Isaiah,47,14,"Look, they are like stubble;
fire burns them.
They cannot rescue themselves
from the power of the flame.
This is not a coal for warming themselves,
or a fire to sit beside!"

those who have wearied you
and have traded with you from your youth —
each wanders on his own way;
no one can save you."

those who are called by the name Israel
and have descended from Judah,
who swear by the name of the LORD
and declare the God of Israel,
but not in truth or righteousness."

and lean on the God of Israel;
his name is the LORD of Armies."
Isaiah,48,3,"I declared the past events long ago;
they came out of my mouth; I proclaimed them.
Suddenly I acted, and they occurred."
Isaiah,48,4,"Because I know that you are stubborn,
and your neck is iron
and your forehead bronze"
Isaiah,48,5,"therefore I declared to you long ago.
I announced it to you before it occurred,
so you could not claim, ‘My idol caused them;
my carved image and cast idol control them.’"
Isaiah,48,6,"You have heard it. Observe it all.
Will you not acknowledge it?
From now on I will announce new things to you,
hidden things that you have not known."
Isaiah,48,7,"They have been created now, and not long ago;
you have not heard of them before today,
so you could not claim, ‘I already knew them!’"
Isaiah,48,8,"You have never heard; you have never known;
for a long time your ears have not been open.
For I knew that you were very treacherous,
and were known as a rebel from birth."

they stood up together."

yes, I have called him;
I have brought him,
and he will succeed in his mission."

and the offspring of your body like its grains;
their name would not be cut off
or eliminated from my presence."

flee from the Chaldeans!
Declare with a shout of joy,
proclaim this,
let it go out to the end of the earth;

he hid me in the shadow of his hand.
He made me like a sharpened arrow;
he hid me in his quiver."
Isaiah,49,3,"He said to me, “You are my servant,
Israel, in whom I will be glorified.”"
Isaiah,49,4,"But I myself said: I have labored in vain,
I have spent my strength for nothing and futility;
yet my vindication is with the LORD,
and my reward is with my God."
Isaiah,49,5,"And now, says the LORD,
who formed me from the womb to be his servant,
to bring Jacob back to him
so that Israel might be gathered to him;
for I am honored in the sight of the LORD,
and my God is my strength "
Isaiah,49,6,"he says,
“It is not enough for you to be my servant
raising up the tribes of Jacob
and restoring the protected ones of Israel.

to be my salvation to the ends of the earth.”"
Isaiah,49,7,"This is what the LORD,
the Redeemer of Israel, his Holy One, says
to one who is despised,
to one abhorred by people,
to a servant of rulers:
“Kings will see, princes will stand up,
and they will all bow down
because of the LORD, who is faithful,
the Holy One of Israel  — and he has chosen you.”"
Isaiah,49,8,"This is what the LORD says:
I will answer you in a time of favor,
and I will help you in the day of salvation.
I will keep you, and I will appoint you
to be a covenant for the people,
to restore the land,
to make them possess the desolate inheritances"

and put them on as a bride does."
Isaiah,49,19,"For your waste and desolate places
and your land marked by ruins
will now be indeed too small for the inhabitants,
and those who swallowed you up will be far away."
Isaiah,49,20,"Yet as you listen, the children
that you have been deprived of will say,
‘This place is too small for me;
make room for me so that I may settle.’"
Isaiah,49,21,"Then you will say within yourself,
‘Who fathered these for me?
I was deprived of my children and unable to conceive,
exiled and wandering —
but who brought them up?
See, I was left by myself —
but these, where did they come from?’”"

those who put their hope in me
will not be put to shame."
Isaiah,49,24,"Can the prey be taken from a mighty man,
or the captives of a tyrant be delivered?"

Isaiah,50,1,"This is what the LORD says:
Where is your mother’s divorce certificate
that I used to send her away?
Or to which of my creditors did I sell you?
Look, you were sold for your iniquities,
and your mother was sent away
because of your transgressions."
Isaiah,50,2,"Why was no one there when I came?
Why was there no one to answer when I called?
Is my arm too weak to redeem?
Or do I have no power to rescue?
Look, I dry up the sea by my rebuke;
I turn the rivers into a wilderness;
their fish rot because of lack of water
and die of thirst."
Isaiah,50,3,"I dress the heavens in black
and make sackcloth their covering."

therefore I have set my face like flint,

Indeed, all of them will wear out like a garment;
a moth will devour them."

and listens to his servant?
Who among you walks in darkness,
and has no light?
Let him trust in the name of the LORD;
let him lean on his God."
Isaiah,50,11,"Look, all you who kindle a fire,
who encircle yourselves with torches;
walk in the light of your fire
and of the torches you have lit!
This is what you’ll get from my hand:
you will lie down in a place of torment."

you who seek the LORD:
Look to the rock from which you were cut,

and look at the earth beneath;
for the heavens will vanish like smoke,
the earth will wear out like a garment,

the people in whose heart is my instruction:
do not fear disgrace by men,
and do not be shattered by their taunts."

and worms will eat them like wool.
But my righteousness will last forever,
and my salvation for all generations."

Arm of the LORD, clothe yourself with strength.
Wake up as in days past,
as in generations long ago.

the waters of the great deep,
who made the sea-bed into a road

and come to Zion with singing,
crowned with unending joy.
Joy and gladness will overtake them,

in order to plant the heavens,
to found the earth,
and to say to Zion, “You are my people.”"
Isaiah,51,17,"Wake yourself, wake yourself up!
Stand up, Jerusalem,
you who have drunk the cup of his fury
from the LORD’s hand;
you who have drunk the goblet to the dregs —
the cup that causes people to stagger."
Isaiah,51,18,"There is no one to guide her
among all the children she has raised;
there is no one to take hold of her hand
among all the offspring she has brought up."

devastation and destruction,
famine and sword.
Who will grieve for you?
How can I comfort you?"

they lie at the head of every street
like an antelope in a net.
They are full of the LORD’s fury,
the rebuke of your God."
Isaiah,51,21,"So listen to this, suffering
and drunken one — but not with wine."
Isaiah,51,22,"This is what your Lord says —
the LORD, even your God,
who defends his people  —
“Look, I have removed from your hand
the cup that causes staggering;
that goblet, the cup of my fury.
You will never drink it again."

his appearance was so disfigured
that he did not look like a man,
and his form did not resemble a human being "
Isaiah,52,15,"so he will sprinkle many nations.
Kings will shut their mouths because of him,
for they will see what had not been told them,
and they will understand what they had not heard."
Isaiah,53,1,"Who has believed what we have heard?
And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?"

and like a root out of dry ground.
He didn’t have an impressive form
or majesty that we should look at him,
no appearance that we should desire him."
Isaiah,53,3,"He was despised and rejected by men,
a man of suffering who knew what sickness was.
He was like someone people turned away from;

and he carried our pains;
but we in turn regarded him stricken,

but he was with a rich man at his death,
because he had done no violence
and had not spoken deceitfully."

he will see light and be satisfied.
By his knowledge,
my righteous servant will justify many,

says the LORD."
Isaiah,54,2,"“Enlarge the site of your tent,
and let your tent curtains be stretched out;
do not hold back;
lengthen your ropes,
and drive your pegs deep."
Isaiah,54,3,"For you will spread out to the right and to the left,
and your descendants will dispossess nations
and inhabit the desolate cities."
Isaiah,54,4,"“Do not be afraid, for you will not be put to shame;
don’t be humiliated, for you will not be disgraced.
For you will forget the shame of your youth,
and you will no longer remember
the disgrace of your widowhood."
Isaiah,54,5,"Indeed, your husband is your Maker  —
his name is the LORD of Armies —
and the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer;
he is called the God of the whole earth."
Isaiah,54,6,"For the LORD has called you,
like a wife deserted and wounded in spirit,
a wife of one’s youth when she is rejected,”
says your God."
Isaiah,54,7,"“I deserted you for a brief moment,
but I will take you back with abundant compassion."
Isaiah,54,8,"In a surge of anger
I hid my face from you for a moment,
but I will have compassion on you
with everlasting love,”
says the LORD your Redeemer."
Isaiah,54,9,"“For this is like the days of Noah to me:
when I swore that the water of Noah
would never flood the earth again,
so I have sworn that I will not be angry with you
or rebuke you."
Isaiah,54,10,"Though the mountains move
and the hills shake,
my love will not be removed from you
and my covenant of peace will not be shaken,”
says your compassionate LORD."
Isaiah,54,11,"“Poor Jerusalem, storm-tossed, and not comforted,
I will set your stones in black mortar,
and lay your foundations in lapis lazuli."
Isaiah,54,12,"I will make your fortifications out of rubies,
your gates out of sparkling stones,
and all your walls out of precious stones."
Isaiah,54,13,"Then all your children will be taught by the LORD,
their prosperity will be great"
Isaiah,54,14,"and you will be established
on a foundation of righteousness.
You will be far from oppression,
you will certainly not be afraid;
you will be far from terror,
it will certainly not come near you."
Isaiah,54,15,"If anyone attacks you,
it is not from me;
whoever attacks you
will fall before you."
Isaiah,54,16,"Look, I have created the craftsman
who blows on the charcoal fire
and produces a weapon suitable for its task;
and I have created the destroyer to cause havoc."
Isaiah,54,17,"No weapon formed against you will succeed,
and you will refute any accusation
raised against you in court.
This is the heritage of the LORD’s servants,
and their vindication is from me.”
This is the LORD’s declaration."
Isaiah,55,1,"“Come, everyone who is thirsty,
come to the water;
and you without silver,
come, buy, and eat!
Come, buy wine and milk
without silver and without cost!"
Isaiah,55,2,"Why do you spend silver on what is not food,
and your wages on what does not satisfy?
Listen carefully to me, and eat what is good,
and you will enjoy the choicest of foods."
Isaiah,55,3,"Pay attention and come to me;
listen, so that you will live.
I will make a permanent covenant with you
on the basis of the faithful kindnesses of David."
Isaiah,55,4,"Since I have made him a witness to the peoples,
a leader and commander for the peoples"
Isaiah,55,5,"so you will summon a nation you do not know,
and nations who do not know you will run to you.
For the LORD your God,
even the Holy One of Israel,
has glorified you.”"
Isaiah,55,6,"Seek the LORD while he may be found;
call to him while he is near."
Isaiah,55,7,"Let the wicked one abandon his way
and the sinful one his thoughts;
let him return to the LORD,
so he may have compassion on him,
and to our God, for he will freely forgive."
Isaiah,55,8,"“For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
and your ways are not my ways.”
This is the LORD’s declaration."
Isaiah,55,9,"“For as heaven is higher than earth,
so my ways are higher than your ways,
and my thoughts than your thoughts."
Isaiah,55,10,"For just as rain and snow fall from heaven
and do not return there
without saturating the earth
and making it germinate and sprout,
and providing seed to sow
and food to eat"
Isaiah,55,11,"so my word that comes from my mouth
will not return to me empty,
but it will accomplish what I please
and will prosper in what I send it to do.”"
Isaiah,55,12,"You will indeed go out with joy
and be peacefully guided;
the mountains and the hills will break into singing before you,
and all the trees of the field will clap their hands."
Isaiah,55,13,"Instead of the thornbush, a cypress will come up,
and instead of the brier, a myrtle will come up;
this will stand as a monument for the LORD,
an everlasting sign that will not be destroyed."
Isaiah,56,1,"This is what the LORD says:
Preserve justice and do what is right,
for my salvation is coming soon,
and my righteousness will be revealed."
Isaiah,56,2,"Happy is the person who does this,
the son of man who holds it fast,
who keeps the Sabbath without desecrating it,
and keeps his hand from doing any evil."
Isaiah,56,3,"No foreigner who has joined himself to the LORD
should say,
“The LORD will exclude me from his people,”
and the eunuch should not say,
“Look, I am a dried-up tree.”"
Isaiah,56,4,"For the LORD says this:
“For the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths,
and choose what pleases me,
and hold firmly to my covenant"
Isaiah,56,5,"I will give them, in my house and within my walls,
a memorial and a name
better than sons and daughters.
I will give each of them an everlasting name
that will never be cut off."
Isaiah,56,6,"As for the foreigners who join themselves to the LORD
to minister to him, to love the name of the LORD,
and to become his servants —
all who keep the Sabbath without desecrating it
and who hold firmly to my covenant "
Isaiah,56,7,"I will bring them to my holy mountain
and let them rejoice in my house of prayer.
Their burnt offerings and sacrifices
will be acceptable on my altar,
for my house will be called a house of prayer
for all nations.”"
Isaiah,56,8,"This is the declaration of the Lord GOD,
who gathers the dispersed of Israel:
“I will gather to them still others
besides those already gathered.”"
Isaiah,56,9,"All you animals of the field and forest,
come and eat!"
Isaiah,56,10,"Israel’s watchmen are blind, all of them,
they know nothing;
all of them are mute dogs,
they cannot bark;
they dream, lie down,
and love to sleep."
Isaiah,56,11,"These dogs have fierce appetites;
they never have enough.
And they are shepherds
who have no discernment;
all of them turn to their own way,
every last one for his own profit."
Isaiah,56,12,"“Come, let me get some wine,
let’s guzzle some beer;
and tomorrow will be like today,
only far better!”"
Isaiah,57,1,"The righteous person perishes,
and no one takes it to heart;
the faithful are taken away,
with no one realizing
that the righteous person is taken away
because of evil."
Isaiah,57,2,"He will enter into peace —
they will rest on their beds  —
everyone who lives uprightly."
Isaiah,57,3,"But come here,
you witch’s sons,
offspring of an adulterer and a prostitute!"
Isaiah,57,4,"Who are you mocking?
Who are you opening your mouth
and sticking out your tongue at?
Isn’t it you, you rebellious children,
you offspring of liars"
Isaiah,57,5,"who burn with lust among the oaks,
under every green tree,
who slaughter children in the wadis
below the clefts of the rocks?"
Isaiah,57,6,"Your portion is among the smooth stones of the wadi;
indeed, they are your lot.
You have even poured out a drink offering to them;
you have offered a grain offering;
should I be satisfied with these?"
Isaiah,57,7,"You have placed your bed
on a high and lofty mountain;
you also went up there to offer sacrifice."
Isaiah,57,8,"You have set up your memorial
behind the door and doorpost.
For away from me, you stripped,
went up, and made your bed wide,
and you have made a bargain for yourself with them.
You have loved their bed;
you have gazed on their genitals."
Isaiah,57,9,"You went to the king with oil
and multiplied your perfumes;
you sent your envoys far away
and sent them down even to Sheol."
Isaiah,57,10,"You became weary on your many journeys,
but you did not say, “It’s hopeless!”
You found a renewal of your strength;
therefore you did not grow weak."
Isaiah,57,11,"Who was it you dreaded and feared,
so that you lied and didn’t remember me
or take it to heart?
I have kept silent for a long time, haven’t I?
So you do not fear me."
Isaiah,57,12,"I will announce your righteousness,
and your works — they will not profit you."
Isaiah,57,13,"When you cry out,
let your collection of idols rescue you!
The wind will carry all of them off,
a breath will take them away.
But whoever takes refuge in me
will inherit the land
and possess my holy mountain."
Isaiah,57,14,"He said,
“Build it up, build it up, prepare the way,
remove every obstacle from my people’s way.”"
Isaiah,57,15,"For the High and Exalted One,
who lives forever, whose name is holy, says this:
“I live in a high and holy place,
and with the oppressed and lowly of spirit,
to revive the spirit of the lowly
and revive the heart of the oppressed."
Isaiah,57,16,"For I will not accuse you forever,
and I will not always be angry;
for then the spirit would grow weak before me,
even the breath, which I have made."
Isaiah,57,17,"Because of his sinful greed I was angry,
so I struck him; I was angry and hid;
but he went on turning back to the desires of his heart."
Isaiah,57,18,"I have seen his ways, but I will heal him;
I will lead him and restore comfort
to him and his mourners"
Isaiah,57,19,"creating words of praise.”
The LORD says,
“Peace, peace to the one who is far or near,
and I will heal him."
Isaiah,57,20,"But the wicked are like the storm-tossed sea,
for it cannot be still,
and its water churns up mire and muck."
Isaiah,57,21,"There is no peace for the wicked,”
says my God."
Isaiah,58,1,"“Cry out loudly, don’t hold back!
Raise your voice like a ram’s horn.
Tell my people their transgression
and the house of Jacob their sins."
Isaiah,58,2,"They seek me day after day
and delight to know my ways,
like a nation that does what is right
and does not abandon the justice of their God.
They ask me for righteous judgments;
they delight in the nearness of God.”"
Isaiah,58,3,"“Why have we fasted, but you have not seen?
We have denied ourselves, but you haven’t noticed!”
“Look, you do as you please on the day of your fast,
and oppress all your workers."
Isaiah,58,4,"You fast with contention and strife
to strike viciously with your fist.
You cannot fast as you do today,
hoping to make your voice heard on high."
Isaiah,58,5,"Will the fast I choose be like this:
A day for a person to deny himself,
to bow his head like a reed,
and to spread out sackcloth and ashes?
Will you call this a fast
and a day acceptable to the LORD?"
Isaiah,58,6,"Isn’t this the fast I choose:
To break the chains of wickedness,
to untie the ropes of the yoke,
to set the oppressed free,
and to tear off every yoke?"
Isaiah,58,7,"Is it not to share your bread with the hungry,
to bring the poor and homeless into your house,
to clothe the naked when you see him,
and not to ignore your own flesh and blood?"
Isaiah,58,8,"Then your light will appear like the dawn,
and your recovery will come quickly.
Your righteousness will go before you,
and the LORD’s glory will be your rear guard."
Isaiah,58,9,"At that time, when you call, the LORD will answer;
when you cry out, he will say, ‘Here I am.’
If you get rid of the yoke among you,
the finger-pointing and malicious speaking"
Isaiah,58,10,"and if you offer yourself to the hungry,
and satisfy the afflicted one,
then your light will shine in the darkness,
and your night will be like noonday."
Isaiah,58,11,"The LORD will always lead you,
satisfy you in a parched land,
and strengthen your bones.
You will be like a watered garden
and like a spring whose water never runs dry."
Isaiah,58,12,"Some of you will rebuild the ancient ruins;
you will restore the foundations laid long ago;
you will be called the repairer of broken walls,
the restorer of streets where people live."
Isaiah,58,13,"“If you keep from desecrating the Sabbath,
from doing whatever you want on my holy day;
if you call the Sabbath a delight,
and the holy day of the LORD honorable;
if you honor it, not going your own ways,
seeking your own pleasure, or talking business"
Isaiah,58,14,"then you will delight in the LORD,
and I will make you ride over the heights of the land,
and let you enjoy the heritage of your father Jacob.”
For the mouth of the LORD has spoken."
Isaiah,59,1,"Indeed, the LORD’s arm is not too weak to save,
and his ear is not too deaf to hear."
Isaiah,59,2,"But your iniquities are separating you
from your God,
and your sins have hidden his face from you
so that he does not listen."
Isaiah,59,3,"For your hands are defiled with blood
and your fingers, with iniquity;
your lips have spoken lies,
and your tongues mutter injustice."
Isaiah,59,4,"No one makes claims justly;
no one pleads honestly.
They trust in empty and worthless words;
they conceive trouble and give birth to iniquity."
Isaiah,59,5,"They hatch viper’s eggs
and weave spider’s webs.
Whoever eats their eggs will die;
crack one open, and a viper is hatched."
Isaiah,59,6,"Their webs cannot become clothing,
and they cannot cover themselves with their works.
Their works are sinful works,
and violent acts are in their hands."
Isaiah,59,7,"Their feet run after evil,
and they rush to shed innocent blood.
Their thoughts are sinful thoughts;
ruin and wretchedness are in their paths."
Isaiah,59,8,"They have not known the path of peace,
and there is no justice in their ways.
They have made their roads crooked;
no one who walks on them will know peace."
Isaiah,59,9,"Therefore justice is far from us,
and righteousness does not reach us.
We hope for light, but there is darkness;
for brightness, but we live in the night."
Isaiah,59,10,"We grope along a wall like the blind;
we grope like those without eyes.
We stumble at noon as though it were twilight;
we are like the dead among those who are healthy."
Isaiah,59,11,"We all growl like bears
and moan like doves.
We hope for justice, but there is none;
for salvation, but it is far from us."
Isaiah,59,12,"For our transgressions have multiplied before you,
and our sins testify against us.
For our transgressions are with us,
and we know our iniquities"
Isaiah,59,13,"transgression and deception against the LORD,
turning away from following our God,
speaking oppression and revolt,
conceiving and uttering lying words from the heart."
Isaiah,59,14,"Justice is turned back,
and righteousness stands far off.
For truth has stumbled in the public square,
and honesty cannot enter."
Isaiah,59,15,"Truth is missing,
and whoever turns from evil is plundered.
The LORD saw that there was no justice,
and he was offended."
Isaiah,59,16,"He saw that there was no man —
he was amazed that there was no one interceding;
so his own arm brought salvation,
and his own righteousness supported him."
Isaiah,59,17,"He put on righteousness as body armor,
and a helmet of salvation on his head;
he put on garments of vengeance for clothing,
and he wrapped himself in zeal as in a cloak."
Isaiah,59,18,"So he will repay according to their deeds:
fury to his enemies,
retribution to his foes,
and he will repay the coasts and islands."
Isaiah,59,19,"They will fear the name of the LORD in the west
and his glory in the east;
for he will come like a rushing stream
driven by the wind of the LORD."
Isaiah,59,20,"“The Redeemer will come to Zion,
and to those in Jacob who turn from transgression.”
This is the LORD’s declaration."
Isaiah,59,21,"“As for me, this is my covenant with them,” says the LORD: “My Spirit who is on you, and my words that I have put in your mouth, will not depart from your mouth, or from the mouths of your children, or from the mouths of your children’s children, from now on and forever,” says the LORD."
Isaiah,60,1,"Arise, shine, for your light has come,
and the glory of the LORD shines over you."
Isaiah,60,2,"For look, darkness will cover the earth,
and total darkness the peoples;
but the LORD will shine over you,
and his glory will appear over you."
Isaiah,60,3,"Nations will come to your light,
and kings to your shining brightness."
Isaiah,60,4,"Raise your eyes and look around:
they all gather and come to you;
your sons will come from far away,
and your daughters on the hips of nursing mothers."
Isaiah,60,5,"Then you will see and be radiant,
and your heart will tremble and rejoice,
because the riches of the sea will become yours
and the wealth of the nations will come to you."
Isaiah,60,6,"Caravans of camels will cover your land  —
young camels of Midian and Ephah —
all of them will come from Sheba.
They will carry gold and frankincense
and proclaim the praises of the LORD."
Isaiah,60,7,"All the flocks of Kedar will be gathered to you;
the rams of Nebaioth will serve you
and go up on my altar as an acceptable sacrifice.
I will glorify my beautiful house."
Isaiah,60,8,"Who are these who fly like a cloud,
like doves to their shelters?"
Isaiah,60,9,"Yes, the coasts and islands will wait for me
with the ships of Tarshish in the lead,
to bring your children from far away,
their silver and gold with them,
for the honor of the LORD your God,
the Holy One of Israel,
who has glorified you."
Isaiah,60,10,"Foreigners will rebuild your walls,
and their kings will serve you.
Although I struck you in my wrath,
yet I will show mercy to you with my favor."
Isaiah,60,11,"Your city gates will always be open;
they will never be shut day or night
so that the wealth of the nations
may be brought into you,
with their kings being led in procession."
Isaiah,60,12,"For the nation and the kingdom
that will not serve you will perish;
those nations will be annihilated."
Isaiah,60,13,"The glory of Lebanon will come to you  —
its pine, elm, and cypress together  —
to beautify the place of my sanctuary,
and I will glorify my dwelling place."
Isaiah,60,14,"The sons of your oppressors
will come and bow down to you;
all who reviled you
will fall facedown at your feet.
They will call you the City of the LORD,
Zion of the Holy One of Israel."
Isaiah,60,15,"Instead of your being deserted and hated,
with no one passing through,
I will make you an object of eternal pride,
a joy from age to age."
Isaiah,60,16,"You will nurse on the milk of nations,
and nurse at the breast of kings;
you will know that I, the LORD, am your Savior
and Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob."
Isaiah,60,17,"I will bring gold instead of bronze;
I will bring silver instead of iron,
bronze instead of wood,
and iron instead of stones.
I will appoint peace as your government
and righteousness as your overseers."
Isaiah,60,18,"Violence will never again be heard of in your land;
devastation and destruction
will be gone from your borders.
You will call your walls Salvation
and your city gates Praise."
Isaiah,60,19,"The sun will no longer be your light by day,
and the brightness of the moon will not shine on you.
The LORD will be your everlasting light,
and your God will be your splendor."
Isaiah,60,20,"Your sun will no longer set,
and your moon will not fade;
for the LORD will be your everlasting light,
and the days of your sorrow will be over."
Isaiah,60,21,"All your people will be righteous;
they will possess the land forever;
they are the branch I planted,
the work of my hands,
so that I may be glorified."
Isaiah,60,22,"The least will become a thousand,
the smallest a mighty nation.
I am the LORD;
I will accomplish it quickly in its time."
Isaiah,61,1,"The Spirit of the Lord GOD is on me,
because the LORD has anointed me
to bring good news to the poor.
He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted,
to proclaim liberty to the captives
and freedom to the prisoners"
Isaiah,61,2,"to proclaim the year of the LORD’s favor,
and the day of our God’s vengeance;
to comfort all who mourn"
Isaiah,61,3,"to provide for those who mourn in Zion;
to give them a crown of beauty instead of ashes,
festive oil instead of mourning,
and splendid clothes instead of despair.
And they will be called righteous trees,
planted by the LORD
to glorify him."
Isaiah,61,4,"They will rebuild the ancient ruins;
they will restore the former devastations;
they will renew the ruined cities,
the devastations of many generations."
Isaiah,61,5,"Strangers will stand and feed your flocks,
and foreigners will be your plowmen and vinedressers."
Isaiah,61,6,"But you will be called the LORD’s priests;
they will speak of you as ministers of our God;
you will eat the wealth of the nations,
and you will boast in their riches."

in place of disgrace, they will rejoice over their share.
So they will possess double in their land,
and eternal joy will be theirs."

I hate robbery and injustice;
I will faithfully reward my people
and make a permanent covenant with them."

and their posterity among the peoples.
All who see them will recognize
that they are a people the LORD has blessed."
Isaiah,61,10,"I rejoice greatly in the LORD,
I exult in my God;
for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation
and wrapped me in a robe of righteousness,
as a groom wears a turban
and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels."
Isaiah,61,11,"For as the earth produces its growth,
and as a garden enables what is sown to spring up,
so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise
to spring up before all the nations."
Isaiah,62,1,"I will not keep silent because of Zion,
and I will not keep still because of Jerusalem,

and your land will not be called Desolate;
instead, you will be called My Delight Is in Her,
and your land Married;
for the LORD delights in you,
and your land will be married."

so your sons will marry you;
and as a groom rejoices over his bride,
so your God will rejoice over you."
Isaiah,62,6,"Jerusalem,
I have appointed watchmen on your walls;
they will never be silent, day or night.
There is no rest for you,
who remind the LORD."

until he establishes and makes Jerusalem
the praise of the earth."
Isaiah,62,8,"The LORD has sworn with his right hand
and his strong arm:
I will no longer give your grain
to your enemies for food,
and foreigners will not drink the new wine
for which you have labored."
Isaiah,62,9,"For those who gather grain will eat it
and praise the LORD,
and those who harvest the grapes will drink the wine
in my holy courts."
Isaiah,62,10,"Go out, go out through the city gates;
prepare a way for the people!
Build it up, build up the highway;
clear away the stones!
Raise a banner for the peoples."

to the ends of the earth,
“Say to Daughter Zion:
Look, your salvation is coming,
his wages are with him,
and his reward accompanies him.”"
Isaiah,62,12,"And they will be called the Holy People,
the LORD’s Redeemed;
and you will be called Cared For,
A City Not Deserted."
Isaiah,63,1,"Who is this coming from Edom
in crimson-stained garments from Bozrah —
this one who is splendid in his apparel,
striding in his formidable might?
It is I, proclaiming vindication,
powerful to save."
Isaiah,63,2,"Why are your clothes red,
and your garments like one who treads a winepress?"
Isaiah,63,3,"I trampled the winepress alone,
and no one from the nations was with me.
I trampled them in my anger
and ground them underfoot in my fury;
their blood spattered my garments,
and all my clothes were stained."
Isaiah,63,4,"For I planned the day of vengeance,
and the year of my redemption came."
Isaiah,63,5,"I looked, but there was no one to help,
and I was amazed that no one assisted;
so my arm accomplished victory for me,
and my wrath assisted me."
Isaiah,63,6,"I crushed nations in my anger;
I made them drunk with my wrath
and poured out their blood on the ground."
Isaiah,63,7,"I will make known the LORD’s faithful love
and the LORD’s praiseworthy acts,
because of all the LORD has done for us —
even the many good things
he has done for the house of Israel,
which he did for them based on his compassion
and the abundance of his faithful love."
Isaiah,63,8,"He said, “They are indeed my people,
children who will not be disloyal,”
and he became their Savior."
Isaiah,63,9,"In all their suffering, he suffered,
and the angel of his presence saved them.
He redeemed them
because of his love and compassion;
he lifted them up and carried them
all the days of the past."
Isaiah,63,10,"But they rebelled
and grieved his Holy Spirit.
So he became their enemy
and fought against them."
Isaiah,63,11,"Then he remembered the days of the past,
the days of Moses and his people.
Where is he who brought them out of the sea
with the shepherds of his flock?
Where is he who put his Holy Spirit among the flock?"
Isaiah,63,12,"He made his glorious strength
available at the right hand of Moses,
divided the water before them
to make an eternal name for himself"
Isaiah,63,13,"and led them through the depths
like a horse in the wilderness,
so that they did not stumble."
Isaiah,63,14,"Like cattle that go down into the valley,
the Spirit of the LORD gave them rest.
You led your people this way
to make a glorious name for yourself."
Isaiah,63,15,"Look down from heaven and see
from your lofty home — holy and beautiful.
Where is your zeal and your might?
Your yearning and your compassion
are withheld from me."
Isaiah,63,16,"Yet you are our Father,
even though Abraham does not know us
and Israel doesn’t recognize us.
You, LORD, are our Father;
your name is Our Redeemer
from Ancient Times."
Isaiah,63,17,"Why, LORD, do you make us stray from your ways?
You harden our hearts so we do not fear you.
Return, because of your servants,
the tribes of your heritage."
Isaiah,63,18,"Your holy people had a possession
for a little while,
but our enemies have trampled down
your sanctuary."
Isaiah,63,19,"We have become like those you never ruled,
like those who did not bear your name."
Isaiah,64,1,"If only you would tear the heavens open
and come down,
so that mountains would quake at your presence  "
Isaiah,64,2,"just as fire kindles brushwood,
and fire boils water —
to make your name known to your enemies,
so that nations would tremble at your presence!"
Isaiah,64,3,"When you did awesome works
that we did not expect,
you came down,
and the mountains quaked at your presence."
Isaiah,64,4,"From ancient times no one has heard,
no one has listened to,
no eye has seen any God except you
who acts on behalf of the one who waits for him."
Isaiah,64,5,"You welcome the one who joyfully does what is right;
they remember you in your ways.
