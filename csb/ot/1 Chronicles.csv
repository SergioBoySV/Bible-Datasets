gather us and rescue us from the nations
so that we may give thanks to your holy name
and rejoice in your praise."
1 Chronicles,16,36,"Blessed be the LORD God of Israel
from everlasting to everlasting.”

1 Chronicles,17,15,Nathan reported all these words and this entire vision to David.
1 Chronicles,17,16,"Then King David went in, sat in the LORD’s presence, and said,
Who am I, LORD God, and what is my house that you have brought me this far?"
1 Chronicles,17,17,"This was a little thing to you, God, for you have spoken about your servant’s house in the distant future. You regard me as a man of distinction, LORD God."

1 Chronicles,19,1,"Some time later, King Nahash of the Ammonites died, and his son became king in his place."
1 Chronicles,19,2,"Then David said, “I’ll show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me.”
So David sent messengers to console him concerning his father. However, when David’s emissaries arrived in the land of the Ammonites to console him"
1 Chronicles,19,3,"the Ammonite leaders said to Hanun, “Just because David has sent men with condolences for you, do you really believe he’s showing respect for your father? Instead, haven’t his emissaries come in order to scout out, overthrow, and spy on the land?”"
1 Chronicles,19,4,"So Hanun took David’s emissaries, shaved them, cut their clothes in half at the hips, and sent them away."
1 Chronicles,19,5,"It was reported to David about his men, so he sent messengers to meet them, since the men were deeply humiliated. The king said, “Stay in Jericho until your beards grow back; then return.”"
1 Chronicles,19,6,"When the Ammonites realized they had made themselves repulsive to David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent thirty-eight tons of silver to hire chariots and horsemen from Aram-naharaim, Aram-maacah, and Zobah."
1 Chronicles,19,7,"They hired thirty-two thousand chariots and the king of Maacah with his army, who came and camped near Medeba. The Ammonites also came together from their cities for the battle."
1 Chronicles,19,8,David heard about this and sent Joab and all the elite troops.
1 Chronicles,19,9,The Ammonites marched out and lined up in battle formation at the entrance of the city while the kings who had come were in the field by themselves.
1 Chronicles,19,10,"When Joab saw that there was a battle line in front of him and another behind him, he chose some of Israel’s finest young men and lined up in formation to engage the Arameans."
1 Chronicles,19,11,He placed the rest of the forces under the command of his brother Abishai. They lined up in formation to engage the Ammonites.
1 Chronicles,19,12,"“If the Arameans are too strong for me,” Joab said, “then you’ll be my help. However, if the Ammonites are too strong for you, I’ll help you."
1 Chronicles,19,13,Be strong! Let’s prove ourselves strong for our people and for the cities of our God. May the LORD’s will be done.”
1 Chronicles,19,14,"Joab and the people with him approached the Arameans for battle, and they fled before him."
1 Chronicles,19,15,"When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans had fled, they likewise fled before Joab’s brother Abishai and entered the city. Then Joab went to Jerusalem."
1 Chronicles,19,16,"When the Arameans realized that they had been defeated by Israel, they sent messengers to summon the Arameans who were beyond the Euphrates River. They were led by Shophach, the commander of Hadadezer’s army."
1 Chronicles,19,17,"When this was reported to David, he gathered all Israel and crossed the Jordan. He came up to the Arameans and lined up against them. When David lined up to engage them, they fought against him."
1 Chronicles,19,18,"But the Arameans fled before Israel, and David killed seven thousand of their charioteers and forty thousand foot soldiers. He also killed Shophach, commander of the army."
1 Chronicles,19,19,"When Hadadezer’s subjects saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and became his subjects. After this, the Arameans were never willing to help the Ammonites again."
1 Chronicles,20,1,"In the spring when kings march out to war, Joab led the army and destroyed the Ammonites’ land. He came to Rabbah and besieged it, but David remained in Jerusalem. Joab attacked Rabbah and demolished it."
1 Chronicles,20,2,"Then David took the crown from the head of their king, and it was placed on David’s head. He found that the crown weighed seventy-five pounds of gold, and there was a precious stone in it. In addition, David took away a large quantity of plunder from the city."
1 Chronicles,20,3,"He brought out the people who were in it and put them to work with saws, iron picks, and axes. David did the same to all the Ammonite cities. Then he and all his troops returned to Jerusalem."
1 Chronicles,20,4,"After this, a war broke out with the Philistines at Gezer. At that time Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, a descendant of the Rephaim, and the Philistines were subdued."
1 Chronicles,20,5,"Once again there was a battle with the Philistines, and Elhanan son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath of Gath. The shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam."
1 Chronicles,20,6,"There was still another battle at Gath where there was a man of extraordinary stature with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot — twenty-four in all. He, too, was descended from the giant."
1 Chronicles,20,7,"When he taunted Israel, Jonathan son of David’s brother Shimei killed him."
1 Chronicles,20,8,These were the descendants of the giant in Gath killed by David and his soldiers.
1 Chronicles,21,1,Satan rose up against Israel and incited David to count the people of Israel.
1 Chronicles,21,2,"So David said to Joab and the commanders of the troops, “Go and count Israel from Beer-sheba to Dan and bring a report to me so I can know their number.”"
1 Chronicles,21,3,"Joab replied, “May the LORD multiply the number of his people a hundred times over! My lord the king, aren’t they all my lord’s servants? Why does my lord want to do this? Why should he bring guilt on Israel?”"
1 Chronicles,21,4,Yet the king’s order prevailed over Joab. So Joab left and traveled throughout Israel and then returned to Jerusalem.
1 Chronicles,21,5,Joab gave the total troop registration to David. In all Israel there were one million one hundred thousand armed men and in Judah itself four hundred seventy thousand armed men.
1 Chronicles,21,6,But he did not include Levi and Benjamin in the count because the king’s command was detestable to him.
1 Chronicles,21,7,"This command was also evil in God’s sight, so he afflicted Israel."
1 Chronicles,21,8,"David said to God, “I have sinned greatly because I have done this thing. Now, please take away your servant’s guilt, for I’ve been very foolish.”"
1 Chronicles,21,9,"Then the LORD instructed Gad, David’s seer"
1 Chronicles,21,10,"“Go and say to David, ‘This is what the LORD says: I am offering you three choices. Choose one of them for yourself, and I will do it to you.’”"
1 Chronicles,21,11,"So Gad went to David and said to him, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Take your choice"
1 Chronicles,21,12,"three years of famine, or three months of devastation by your foes with the sword of your enemy overtaking you, or three days of the sword of the LORD  — a plague on the land, the angel of the LORD bringing destruction to the whole territory of Israel.’ Now decide what answer I should take back to the one who sent me.”"
1 Chronicles,21,13,"David answered Gad, “I’m in anguish. Please, let me fall into the LORD’s hands because his mercies are very great, but don’t let me fall into human hands.”"
1 Chronicles,21,14,"So the LORD sent a plague on Israel, and seventy thousand Israelite men died."
1 Chronicles,21,15,"Then God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it, but when the angel was about to destroy the city, the LORD looked, relented concerning the destruction, and said to the angel who was destroying the people, “Enough, withdraw your hand now!” The angel of the LORD was then standing at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite."
1 Chronicles,21,16,"When David looked up and saw the angel of the LORD standing between earth and heaven, with his drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem, David and the elders, covered in sackcloth, fell facedown."
1 Chronicles,21,17,"David said to God, “Wasn’t I the one who gave the order to count the people? I am the one who has sinned and acted very wickedly. But these sheep, what have they done? LORD my God, please let your hand be against me and against my father’s family, but don’t let the plague be against your people.”"
1 Chronicles,21,18,So the angel of the LORD ordered Gad to tell David to go and set up an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
1 Chronicles,21,19,David went up at Gad’s command spoken in the name of the LORD.
1 Chronicles,21,20,"Ornan was threshing wheat when he turned and saw the angel. His four sons, who were with him, hid."
1 Chronicles,21,21,"David came to Ornan, and when Ornan looked and saw David, he left the threshing floor and bowed to David with his face to the ground."
1 Chronicles,21,22,"Then David said to Ornan, “Give me this threshing-floor plot so that I may build an altar to the LORD on it. Give it to me for the full price, so the plague on the people may be stopped.”"
1 Chronicles,21,23,"Ornan said to David, “Take it! My lord the king may do whatever he wants. See, I give the oxen for the burnt offerings, the threshing sledges for the wood, and the wheat for the grain offering — I give it all.”"
1 Chronicles,21,24,"King David answered Ornan, “No, I insist on paying the full price, for I will not take for the LORD what belongs to you or offer burnt offerings that cost me nothing.”"
1 Chronicles,21,25,So David gave Ornan fifteen pounds of gold for the plot.
1 Chronicles,21,26,"He built an altar to the LORD there and offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. He called on the LORD, and he answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering."
1 Chronicles,21,27,"Then the LORD spoke to the angel, and he put his sword back into its sheath."
1 Chronicles,21,28,"At that time, David offered sacrifices there when he saw that the LORD answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite."
1 Chronicles,21,29,"The tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering were at the high place in Gibeon"
1 Chronicles,21,30,"but David could not go before it to inquire of God, because he was terrified of the sword of the LORD’s angel."
1 Chronicles,22,1,"Then David said, “This is the house of the LORD God, and this is the altar of burnt offering for Israel.”"
1 Chronicles,22,2,"So David gave orders to gather the resident aliens that were in the land of Israel, and he appointed stonecutters to cut finished stones for building God’s house."
1 Chronicles,22,3,"David supplied a great deal of iron to make the nails for the doors of the gates and for the fittings, together with an immeasurable quantity of bronze"
1 Chronicles,22,4,and innumerable cedar logs because the Sidonians and Tyrians had brought a large quantity of cedar logs to David.
1 Chronicles,22,5,"David said, “My son Solomon is young and inexperienced, and the house that is to be built for the LORD must be exceedingly great and famous and glorious in all the lands. Therefore, I will make provision for it.” So David made lavish preparations for it before his death."
1 Chronicles,22,6,Then he summoned his son Solomon and charged him to build a house for the LORD God of Israel.
1 Chronicles,22,7,"“My son,” David said to Solomon, “It was in my heart to build a house for the name of the LORD my God"
1 Chronicles,22,8,but the word of the LORD came to me: ‘You have shed much blood and waged great wars. You are not to build a house for my name because you have shed so much blood on the ground before me.
1 Chronicles,22,9,"But a son will be born to you; he will be a man of rest. I will give him rest from all his surrounding enemies, for his name will be Solomon, and I will give peace and quiet to Israel during his reign."
1 Chronicles,22,10,"He is the one who will build a house for my name. He will be my son, and I will be his father. I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.’"
1 Chronicles,22,11,"“Now, my son, may the LORD be with you, and may you succeed in building the house of the LORD your God, as he said about you."
1 Chronicles,22,12,"Above all, may the LORD give you insight and understanding when he puts you in charge of Israel so that you may keep the law of the LORD your God."
1 Chronicles,22,13,Then you will succeed if you carefully follow the statutes and ordinances the LORD commanded Moses for Israel. Be strong and courageous. Don’t be afraid or discouraged.
1 Chronicles,22,14,"“Notice I have taken great pains to provide for the house of the LORD  — 3,775 tons of gold, 37,750 tons of silver, and bronze and iron that can’t be weighed because there is so much of it. I have also provided timber and stone, but you will need to add more to them."
1 Chronicles,22,15,"You also have many workers: stonecutters, masons, carpenters, and people skilled in every kind of work"
1 Chronicles,22,16,"in gold, silver, bronze, and iron — beyond number. Now begin the work, and may the LORD be with you.”"
1 Chronicles,22,17,Then David ordered all the leaders of Israel to help his son Solomon
1 Chronicles,22,18,"“The LORD your God is with you, isn’t he? And hasn’t he given you rest on every side? For he has handed the land’s inhabitants over to me, and the land has been subdued before the LORD and his people."
1 Chronicles,22,19,Now determine in your mind and heart to seek the LORD your God. Get started building the LORD God’s sanctuary so that you may bring the ark of the LORD’s covenant and the holy articles of God to the temple that is to be built for the name of the LORD.”
1 Chronicles,23,1,"When David was old and full of days, he installed his son Solomon as king over Israel."
1 Chronicles,23,2,"Then he gathered all the leaders of Israel, the priests, and the Levites."
1 Chronicles,23,3,The Levites thirty years old or more were counted; the total number of men was thirty-eight thousand by headcount.
1 Chronicles,23,4,"“Of these,” David said, “twenty-four thousand are to be in charge of the work on the LORD’s temple, six thousand are to be officers and judges"
1 Chronicles,23,5,"four thousand are to be gatekeepers, and four thousand are to praise the LORD with the instruments that I have made for worship.”"
1 Chronicles,23,6,"Then David divided them into divisions according to Levi’s sons: Gershom, Kohath, and Merari."

1 Chronicles,23,12,"Kohath’s sons: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel — four."
1 Chronicles,23,13,"Amram’s sons: Aaron and Moses.

1 Chronicles,23,25,"For David said, “The LORD God of Israel has given rest to his people, and he has come to stay in Jerusalem forever."
1 Chronicles,23,26,"Also, the Levites no longer need to carry the tabernacle or any of the equipment for its service”  "
1 Chronicles,23,27,"for according to the last words of David, the Levites twenty years old or more were to be counted "
1 Chronicles,23,28,"“but their duty will be to assist the descendants of Aaron with the service of the LORD’s temple, being responsible for the courts and the chambers, the purification of all the holy things, and the work of the service of God’s temple "
