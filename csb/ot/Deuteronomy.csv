Deuteronomy,1,1,"These are the words Moses spoke to all Israel across the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Di-zahab."
Deuteronomy,1,2,It is an eleven-day journey from Horeb to Kadesh-barnea by way of Mount Seir.
Deuteronomy,1,3,"In the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first of the month, Moses told the Israelites everything the LORD had commanded him to say to them."
Deuteronomy,1,4,"This was after he had defeated King Sihon of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and King Og of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth, at Edrei."
Deuteronomy,1,5,"Across the Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses began to explain this law, saying"
Deuteronomy,1,6,“The LORD our God spoke to us at Horeb: ‘You have stayed at this mountain long enough.
Deuteronomy,1,7,"Resume your journey and go to the hill country of the Amorites and their neighbors in the Arabah, the hill country, the Judean foothills, the Negev and the sea coast — to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon as far as the great river, the Euphrates River."
Deuteronomy,1,8,"See, I have set the land before you. Enter and take possession of the land the LORD swore to give to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their future descendants.’"
Deuteronomy,1,9,“I said to you at that time: I can’t bear the responsibility for you on my own.
Deuteronomy,1,10,The LORD your God has so multiplied you that today you are as numerous as the stars of the sky.
Deuteronomy,1,11,"May the LORD, the God of your ancestors, increase you a thousand times more, and bless you as he promised you."
Deuteronomy,1,12,"But how can I bear your troubles, burdens, and disputes by myself?"
Deuteronomy,1,13,"Appoint for yourselves wise, understanding, and respected men from each of your tribes, and I will make them your leaders."
Deuteronomy,1,14,"“You replied to me, ‘What you propose to do is good.’"
Deuteronomy,1,15,"“So I took the leaders of your tribes, wise and respected men, and set them over you as leaders: commanders for thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens, and officers for your tribes."
Deuteronomy,1,16,"I commanded your judges at that time: Hear the cases between your brothers, and judge rightly between a man and his brother or his resident alien."
Deuteronomy,1,17,"Do not show partiality when deciding a case; listen to small and great alike. Do not be intimidated by anyone, for judgment belongs to God. Bring me any case too difficult for you, and I will hear it."
Deuteronomy,1,18,At that time I commanded you about all the things you were to do.
Deuteronomy,1,19,"“We then set out from Horeb and went across all the great and terrible wilderness you saw on the way to the hill country of the Amorites, just as the LORD our God had commanded us. When we reached Kadesh-barnea"
Deuteronomy,1,20,"I said to you: You have reached the hill country of the Amorites, which the LORD our God is giving us."
Deuteronomy,1,21,"See, the LORD your God has set the land before you. Go up and take possession of it as the LORD, the God of your ancestors, has told you. Do not be afraid or discouraged."
Deuteronomy,1,22,"“Then all of you approached me and said, ‘Let’s send men ahead of us, so that they may explore the land for us and bring us back a report about the route we should go up and the cities we will come to.’"
Deuteronomy,1,23,"The plan seemed good to me, so I selected twelve men from among you, one man for each tribe."
Deuteronomy,1,24,"They left and went up into the hill country and came to Eshcol Valley, scouting the land."
Deuteronomy,1,25,"They took some of the fruit from the land in their hands, carried it down to us, and brought us back a report: ‘The land the LORD our God is giving us is good.’"
Deuteronomy,1,26,“But you were not willing to go up. You rebelled against the command of the LORD your God.
Deuteronomy,1,27,"You grumbled in your tents and said, ‘The LORD brought us out of the land of Egypt to hand us over to the Amorites in order to destroy us, because he hates us."
Deuteronomy,1,28,"Where can we go? Our brothers have made us lose heart, saying: The people are larger and taller than we are; the cities are large, fortified to the heavens. We also saw the descendants of the Anakim there.’"
Deuteronomy,1,29,“So I said to you: Don’t be terrified or afraid of them!
Deuteronomy,1,30,"The LORD your God who goes before you will fight for you, just as you saw him do for you in Egypt."
Deuteronomy,1,31,And you saw in the wilderness how the LORD your God carried you as a man carries his son all along the way you traveled until you reached this place.
Deuteronomy,1,32,But in spite of this you did not trust the LORD your God
Deuteronomy,1,33,who went before you on the journey to seek out a place for you to camp. He went in the fire by night and in the cloud by day to guide you on the road you were to travel.
Deuteronomy,1,34,"“When the LORD heard your words, he grew angry and swore an oath"
Deuteronomy,1,35,‘None of these men in this evil generation will see the good land I swore to give your ancestors
Deuteronomy,1,36,"except Caleb the son of Jephunneh. He will see it, and I will give him and his descendants the land on which he has set foot, because he remained loyal to the LORD.’"
Deuteronomy,1,37,"“The LORD was angry with me also because of you and said, ‘You will not enter there either."
Deuteronomy,1,38,"Joshua son of Nun, who attends you, will enter it. Encourage him, for he will enable Israel to inherit it."
Deuteronomy,1,39,"Your children, who you said would be plunder, your sons who don’t yet know good from evil, will enter there. I will give them the land, and they will take possession of it."
Deuteronomy,1,40,But you are to turn back and head for the wilderness by way of the Red Sea.’
Deuteronomy,1,41,"“You answered me, ‘We have sinned against the LORD. We will go up and fight just as the LORD our God commanded us.’ Then each of you put on his weapons of war and thought it would be easy to go up into the hill country."
Deuteronomy,1,42,"“But the LORD said to me, ‘Tell them: Don’t go up and fight, for I am not with you to keep you from being defeated by your enemies.’"
Deuteronomy,1,43,"So I spoke to you, but you didn’t listen. You rebelled against the LORD’s command and defiantly went up into the hill country."
Deuteronomy,1,44,Then the Amorites who lived there came out against you and chased you like a swarm of bees. They routed you from Seir as far as Hormah.
Deuteronomy,1,45,"When you returned, you wept before the LORD, but he didn’t listen to your requests or pay attention to you."
Deuteronomy,1,46,For this reason you stayed in Kadesh as long as you did.
Deuteronomy,2,1,"“Then we turned back and headed for the wilderness by way of the Red Sea, as the LORD had told me, and we traveled around the hill country of Seir for many days."
Deuteronomy,2,2,The LORD then said to me
Deuteronomy,2,3,‘You’ve been traveling around this hill country long enough; turn north.
Deuteronomy,2,4,"Command the people: You are about to travel through the territory of your brothers, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. They will be afraid of you, so be very careful."
Deuteronomy,2,5,"Don’t provoke them, for I will not give you any of their land, not even a foot of it, because I have given Esau the hill country of Seir as his possession."
Deuteronomy,2,6,"You may purchase food from them, so that you may eat, and buy water from them to drink."
Deuteronomy,2,7,"For the LORD your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He has watched over your journey through this immense wilderness. The LORD your God has been with you these past forty years, and you have lacked nothing.’"
Deuteronomy,2,8,"“So we bypassed our brothers, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. We turned away from the Arabah road and from Elath and Ezion-geber. We traveled along the road to the Wilderness of Moab."
Deuteronomy,2,9,"The LORD said to me, ‘Show no hostility toward Moab, and do not provoke them to battle, for I will not give you any of their land as a possession, since I have given Ar as a possession to the descendants of Lot.’”"
Deuteronomy,2,10,"The Emim, a great and numerous people as tall as the Anakim, had previously lived there."
Deuteronomy,2,11,"They were also regarded as Rephaim, like the Anakim, though the Moabites called them Emim."
Deuteronomy,2,12,"The Horites had previously lived in Seir, but the descendants of Esau drove them out, destroying them completely and settling in their place, just as Israel did in the land of its possession the LORD gave them."
Deuteronomy,2,13,"“The LORD said, ‘Now get up and cross the Zered Valley.’ So we crossed the Zered Valley."
Deuteronomy,2,14,"The time we spent traveling from Kadesh-barnea until we crossed the Zered Valley was thirty-eight years until the entire generation of fighting men had perished from the camp, as the LORD had sworn to them."
Deuteronomy,2,15,"Indeed, the LORD’s hand was against them, to eliminate them from the camp until they had all perished."
Deuteronomy,2,16,“When all the fighting men had died among the people
Deuteronomy,2,17,the LORD spoke to me
Deuteronomy,2,18,‘Today you are going to cross the border of Moab at Ar.
Deuteronomy,2,19,"When you get close to the Ammonites, don’t show any hostility to them or provoke them, for I will not give you any of the Ammonites’ land as a possession; I have given it as a possession to the descendants of Lot.’”"
Deuteronomy,2,20,"This too used to be regarded as the land of the Rephaim. The Rephaim lived there previously, though the Ammonites called them Zamzummim"
Deuteronomy,2,21,"a great and numerous people, tall as the Anakim. The LORD destroyed the Rephaim at the advance of the Ammonites, so that they drove them out and settled in their place."
Deuteronomy,2,22,"This was just as he had done for the descendants of Esau who lived in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites before them; they drove them out and have lived in their place until now."
Deuteronomy,2,23,"The Caphtorim, who came from Caphtor, destroyed the Avvites, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, and settled in their place."
Deuteronomy,2,24,"“The LORD also said, ‘Get up, move out, and cross the Arnon Valley. See, I have handed the Amorites’ King Sihon of Heshbon and his land over to you. Begin to take possession of it; engage him in battle."
Deuteronomy,2,25,"Today I will begin to put the fear and dread of you on the peoples everywhere under heaven. They will hear the report about you, tremble, and be in anguish because of you.’"
Deuteronomy,2,26,"“So I sent messengers with an offer of peace to King Sihon of Heshbon from the Wilderness of Kedemoth, saying"
Deuteronomy,2,27,‘Let us travel through your land; we will keep strictly to the highway. We will not turn to the right or the left.
Deuteronomy,2,28,"You can sell us food in exchange for silver so we may eat, and give us water for silver so we may drink. Only let us travel through on foot"
Deuteronomy,2,29,"just as the descendants of Esau who live in Seir did for us, and the Moabites who live in Ar, until we cross the Jordan into the land the LORD our God is giving us.’"
Deuteronomy,2,30,"But King Sihon of Heshbon would not let us travel through his land, for the LORD your God had made his spirit stubborn and his heart obstinate in order to hand him over to you, as has now taken place."
Deuteronomy,2,31,"“Then the LORD said to me, ‘See, I have begun to give Sihon and his land to you. Begin to take possession of it.’"
Deuteronomy,2,32,So Sihon and his whole army came out against us for battle at Jahaz.
Deuteronomy,2,33,"The LORD our God handed him over to us, and we defeated him, his sons, and his whole army."
Deuteronomy,2,34,"At that time we captured all his cities and completely destroyed the people of every city, including the women and children. We left no survivors."
Deuteronomy,2,35,We took only the livestock and the spoil from the cities we captured as plunder for ourselves.
Deuteronomy,2,36,"There was no city that was inaccessible to us, from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Valley, along with the city in the valley, even as far as Gilead. The LORD our God gave everything to us."
Deuteronomy,2,37,"But you did not go near the Ammonites’ land, all along the bank of the Jabbok River, the cities of the hill country, or any place that the LORD our God had forbidden."
Deuteronomy,3,1,"“Then we turned and went up the road to Bashan, and King Og of Bashan came out against us with his whole army to do battle at Edrei."
Deuteronomy,3,2,"But the LORD said to me, ‘Do not fear him, for I have handed him over to you along with his whole army and his land. Do to him as you did to King Sihon of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon.’"
Deuteronomy,3,3,So the LORD our God also handed over King Og of Bashan and his whole army to us. We struck him until there was no survivor left.
Deuteronomy,3,4,"We captured all his cities at that time. There wasn’t a city that we didn’t take from them: sixty cities, the entire region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan."
Deuteronomy,3,5,"All these were fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, besides a large number of rural villages."
Deuteronomy,3,6,"We completely destroyed them, as we had done to King Sihon of Heshbon, destroying the men, women, and children of every city."
Deuteronomy,3,7,But we took all the livestock and the spoil from the cities as plunder for ourselves.
Deuteronomy,3,8,"“At that time we took the land from the two Amorite kings across the Jordan, from the Arnon Valley as far as Mount Hermon"
Deuteronomy,3,9,"which the Sidonians call Sirion, but the Amorites call Senir"
Deuteronomy,3,10,"all the cities of the plateau, Gilead, and Bashan as far as Salecah and Edrei, cities of Og’s kingdom in Bashan."
Deuteronomy,3,11,(Only King Og of Bashan was left of the remnant of the Rephaim. His bed was made of iron. Isn’t it in Rabbah of the Ammonites? It is 13½ feet long and 6 feet wide by a standard measure.)
Deuteronomy,3,12,"“At that time we took possession of this land. I gave to the Reubenites and Gadites the area extending from Aroer by the Arnon Valley, and half the hill country of Gilead along with its cities."
Deuteronomy,3,13,"I gave to half the tribe of Manasseh the rest of Gilead and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og. The entire region of Argob, the whole territory of Bashan, used to be called the land of the Rephaim."
Deuteronomy,3,14,"Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took over the entire region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites. He called Bashan by his own name, Jair’s Villages, as it is today."
Deuteronomy,3,15,I gave Gilead to Machir
Deuteronomy,3,16,"and I gave to the Reubenites and Gadites the area extending from Gilead to the Arnon Valley (the middle of the valley was the border) and up to the Jabbok River, the border of the Ammonites."
Deuteronomy,3,17,"The Arabah and Jordan are also borders from Chinnereth as far as the Sea of the Arabah, the Dead Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah on the east."
Deuteronomy,3,18,“I commanded you at that time: The LORD your God has given you this land to possess. All your valiant men will cross over in battle formation ahead of your brothers the Israelites.
Deuteronomy,3,19,"But your wives, dependents, and livestock — I know that you have a lot of livestock — will remain in the cities I have given you"
Deuteronomy,3,20,"until the LORD gives rest to your brothers as he has to you, and they also take possession of the land the LORD your God is giving them across the Jordan. Then each of you may return to his possession that I have given you."
Deuteronomy,3,21,“I commanded Joshua at that time: Your own eyes have seen everything the LORD your God has done to these two kings. The LORD will do the same to all the kingdoms you are about to enter.
Deuteronomy,3,22,"Don’t be afraid of them, for the LORD your God fights for you."
Deuteronomy,3,23,“At that time I begged the LORD
Deuteronomy,3,24,"Lord GOD, you have begun to show your greatness and your strong hand to your servant, for what god is there in heaven or on earth who can perform deeds and mighty acts like yours?"
Deuteronomy,3,25,"Please let me cross over and see the beautiful land on the other side of the Jordan, that good hill country and Lebanon."
Deuteronomy,3,26,"“But the LORD was angry with me because of you and would not listen to me. The LORD said to me, ‘That’s enough! Do not speak to me again about this matter."
Deuteronomy,3,27,"Go to the top of Pisgah and look to the west, north, south, and east, and see it with your own eyes, for you will not cross the Jordan."
Deuteronomy,3,28,"But commission Joshua and encourage and strengthen him, for he will cross over ahead of the people and enable them to inherit this land that you will see.’"
Deuteronomy,3,29,So we stayed in the valley facing Beth-peor.
Deuteronomy,4,1,"“Now, Israel, listen to the statutes and ordinances I am teaching you to follow, so that you may live, enter, and take possession of the land the LORD, the God of your ancestors, is giving you."
Deuteronomy,4,2,"You must not add anything to what I command you or take anything away from it, so that you may keep the commands of the LORD your God I am giving you."
Deuteronomy,4,3,"Your eyes have seen what the LORD did at Baal-peor, for the LORD your God destroyed every one of you who followed Baal of Peor."
Deuteronomy,4,4,But you who have remained faithful to the LORD your God are all alive today.
Deuteronomy,4,5,"Look, I have taught you statutes and ordinances as the LORD my God has commanded me, so that you may follow them in the land you are entering to possess."
Deuteronomy,4,6,"Carefully follow them, for this will show your wisdom and understanding in the eyes of the peoples. When they hear about all these statutes, they will say, ‘This great nation is indeed a wise and understanding people.’"
Deuteronomy,4,7,For what great nation is there that has a god near to it as the LORD our God is to us whenever we call to him?
Deuteronomy,4,8,And what great nation has righteous statutes and ordinances like this entire law I set before you today?
Deuteronomy,4,9,"“Only be on your guard and diligently watch yourselves, so that you don’t forget the things your eyes have seen and so that they don’t slip from your mind as long as you live. Teach them to your children and your grandchildren."
Deuteronomy,4,10,"The day you stood before the LORD your God at Horeb, the LORD said to me, ‘Assemble the people before me, and I will let them hear my words, so that they may learn to fear me all the days they live on the earth and may instruct their children.’"
Deuteronomy,4,11,"You came near and stood at the base of the mountain, a mountain blazing with fire into the heavens and enveloped in a totally black cloud."
Deuteronomy,4,12,"Then the LORD spoke to you from the fire. You kept hearing the sound of the words, but didn’t see a form; there was only a voice."
Deuteronomy,4,13,"He declared his covenant to you. He commanded you to follow the Ten Commandments, which he wrote on two stone tablets."
Deuteronomy,4,14,At that time the LORD commanded me to teach you statutes and ordinances for you to follow in the land you are about to cross into and possess.
Deuteronomy,4,15,“Diligently watch yourselves — because you did not see any form on the day the LORD spoke to you out of the fire at Horeb 
Deuteronomy,4,16,so you don’t act corruptly and make an idol for yourselves in the shape of any figure: a male or female form
Deuteronomy,4,17,"or the form of any animal on the earth, any winged creature that flies in the sky"
Deuteronomy,4,18,"any creature that crawls on the ground, or any fish in the waters under the earth."
Deuteronomy,4,19,"When you look to the heavens and see the sun, moon, and stars — all the stars in the sky — do not be led astray to bow in worship to them and serve them. The LORD your God has provided them for all people everywhere under heaven."
Deuteronomy,4,20,"But the LORD selected you and brought you out of Egypt’s iron furnace to be a people for his inheritance, as you are today."
Deuteronomy,4,21,“The LORD was angry with me on your account. He swore that I would not cross the Jordan and enter the good land the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance.
Deuteronomy,4,22,I won’t be crossing the Jordan because I am going to die in this land. But you are about to cross over and take possession of this good land.
Deuteronomy,4,23,"Be careful not to forget the covenant of the LORD your God that he made with you, and make an idol for yourselves in the shape of anything he has forbidden you."
Deuteronomy,4,24,"For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God."
Deuteronomy,4,25,"“When you have children and grandchildren and have been in the land a long time, and if you act corruptly, make an idol in the form of anything, and do what is evil in the sight of the LORD your God, angering him"
Deuteronomy,4,26,"I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you today that you will quickly perish from the land you are about to cross the Jordan to possess. You will not live long there, but you will certainly be destroyed."
Deuteronomy,4,27,"The LORD will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be reduced to a few survivors among the nations where the LORD your God will drive you."
Deuteronomy,4,28,"There you will worship man-made gods of wood and stone, which cannot see, hear, eat, or smell."
Deuteronomy,4,29,"But from there, you will search for the LORD your God, and you will find him when you seek him with all your heart and all your soul."
Deuteronomy,4,30,"When you are in distress and all these things have happened to you, in the future you will return to the LORD your God and obey him."
Deuteronomy,4,31,"He will not leave you, destroy you, or forget the covenant with your ancestors that he swore to them by oath, because the LORD your God is a compassionate God."
Deuteronomy,4,32,"“Indeed, ask about the earlier days that preceded you, from the day God created mankind on the earth and from one end of the heavens to the other: Has anything like this great event ever happened, or has anything like it been heard of?"
Deuteronomy,4,33,"Has a people heard God’s voice speaking from the fire as you have, and lived?"
Deuteronomy,4,34,"Or has a god attempted to go and take a nation as his own out of another nation, by trials, signs, wonders, and war, by a strong hand and an outstretched arm, by great terrors, as the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?"
Deuteronomy,4,35,You were shown these things so that you would know that the LORD is God; there is no other besides him.
Deuteronomy,4,36,"He let you hear his voice from heaven to instruct you. He showed you his great fire on earth, and you heard his words from the fire."
Deuteronomy,4,37,"Because he loved your ancestors, he chose their descendants after them and brought you out of Egypt by his presence and great power"
Deuteronomy,4,38,"to drive out before you nations greater and stronger than you and to bring you in and give you their land as an inheritance, as is now taking place."
Deuteronomy,4,39,"Today, recognize and keep in mind that the LORD is God in heaven above and on earth below; there is no other."
Deuteronomy,4,40,"Keep his statutes and commands, which I am giving you today, so that you and your children after you may prosper and so that you may live long in the land the LORD your God is giving you for all time.”"
Deuteronomy,4,41,Then Moses set apart three cities across the Jordan to the east.
Deuteronomy,4,42,"Someone could flee there who committed manslaughter, killing his neighbor accidentally without previously hating him. He could flee to one of these cities and stay alive"
Deuteronomy,4,43,"Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau land, belonging to the Reubenites; Ramoth in Gilead, belonging to the Gadites; or Golan in Bashan, belonging to the Manassites."
Deuteronomy,4,44,This is the law Moses gave the Israelites.
Deuteronomy,4,45,"These are the decrees, statutes, and ordinances Moses proclaimed to them after they came out of Egypt"
Deuteronomy,4,46,"across the Jordan in the valley facing Beth-peor in the land of King Sihon of the Amorites. He lived in Heshbon, and Moses and the Israelites defeated him after they came out of Egypt."
Deuteronomy,4,47,"They took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two Amorite kings who were across the Jordan to the east"
Deuteronomy,4,48,"from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Valley as far as Mount Sion (that is, Hermon)"
Deuteronomy,4,49,and all the Arabah on the east side of the Jordan as far as the Dead Sea below the slopes of Pisgah.
Deuteronomy,5,1,"Moses summoned all Israel and said to them, “Israel, listen to the statutes and ordinances I am proclaiming as you hear them today. Learn and follow them carefully."
Deuteronomy,5,2,The LORD our God made a covenant with us at Horeb.
Deuteronomy,5,3,"He did not make this covenant with our ancestors, but with all of us who are alive here today."
Deuteronomy,5,4,The LORD spoke to you face to face from the fire on the mountain.
Deuteronomy,5,5,"At that time I was standing between the LORD and you to report the word of the LORD to you, because you were afraid of the fire and did not go up the mountain. And he said"
Deuteronomy,5,6,"I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the place of slavery."
Deuteronomy,5,7,Do not have other gods besides me.
Deuteronomy,5,8,Do not make an idol for yourself in the shape of anything in the heavens above or on the earth below or in the waters under the earth.
Deuteronomy,5,9,"Do not bow in worship to them, and do not serve them, because I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, bringing the consequences of the fathers’ iniquity on the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate me"
Deuteronomy,5,10,but showing faithful love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commands.
Deuteronomy,5,11,"Do not misuse the name of the LORD your God, because the LORD will not leave anyone unpunished who misuses his name."
Deuteronomy,5,12,"Be careful to remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy as the LORD your God has commanded you."
Deuteronomy,5,13,You are to labor six days and do all your work
Deuteronomy,5,14,"but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. Do not do any work — you, your son or daughter, your male or female slave, your ox or donkey, any of your livestock, or the resident alien who lives within your city gates, so that your male and female slaves may rest as you do."
Deuteronomy,5,15,"Remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God brought you out of there with a strong hand and an outstretched arm. That is why the LORD your God has commanded you to keep the Sabbath day."
Deuteronomy,5,16,"Honor your father and your mother, as the LORD your God has commanded you, so that you may live long and so that you may prosper in the land the LORD your God is giving you."
Deuteronomy,5,17,Do not murder.
Deuteronomy,5,18,Do not commit adultery.
Deuteronomy,5,19,Do not steal.
Deuteronomy,5,20,Do not give dishonest testimony against your neighbor.
Deuteronomy,5,21,"Do not covet your neighbor’s wife or desire your neighbor’s house, his field, his male or female slave, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor."
Deuteronomy,5,22,"“The LORD spoke these commands in a loud voice to your entire assembly from the fire, cloud, and total darkness on the mountain; he added nothing more. He wrote them on two stone tablets and gave them to me."
Deuteronomy,5,23,All of you approached me with your tribal leaders and elders when you heard the voice from the darkness and while the mountain was blazing with fire.
Deuteronomy,5,24,"You said, ‘Look, the LORD our God has shown us his glory and greatness, and we have heard his voice from the fire. Today we have seen that God speaks with a person, yet he still lives."
Deuteronomy,5,25,"But now, why should we die? This great fire will consume us and we will die if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any longer."
Deuteronomy,5,26,"For who out of all humanity has heard the voice of the living God speaking from the fire, as we have, and lived?"
Deuteronomy,5,27,Go near and listen to everything the LORD our God says. Then you can tell us everything the LORD our God tells you; we will listen and obey.’
Deuteronomy,5,28,"“The LORD heard your words when you spoke to me. He said to me, ‘I have heard the words that these people have spoken to you. Everything they have said is right."
Deuteronomy,5,29,"If only they had such a heart to fear me and keep all my commands always, so that they and their children would prosper forever."
Deuteronomy,5,30,Go and tell them: Return to your tents.
Deuteronomy,5,31,"But you stand here with me, and I will tell you every command — the statutes and ordinances — you are to teach them, so that they may follow them in the land I am giving them to possess.’"
Deuteronomy,5,32,“Be careful to do as the LORD your God has commanded you; you are not to turn aside to the right or the left.
Deuteronomy,5,33,"Follow the whole instruction the LORD your God has commanded you, so that you may live, prosper, and have a long life in the land you will possess."
Deuteronomy,6,1,"“This is the command — the statutes and ordinances — the LORD your God has commanded me to teach you, so that you may follow them in the land you are about to enter and possess."
Deuteronomy,6,2,"Do this so that you may fear the LORD your God all the days of your life by keeping all his statutes and commands I am giving you, your son, and your grandson, and so that you may have a long life."
Deuteronomy,6,3,"Listen, Israel, and be careful to follow them, so that you may prosper and multiply greatly, because the LORD, the God of your ancestors, has promised you a land flowing with milk and honey."
Deuteronomy,6,4,"“Listen, Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one."
Deuteronomy,6,5,"Love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength."
Deuteronomy,6,6,These words that I am giving you today are to be in your heart.
Deuteronomy,6,7,"Repeat them to your children. Talk about them when you sit in your house and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up."
Deuteronomy,6,8,Bind them as a sign on your hand and let them be a symbol on your forehead.
Deuteronomy,6,9,Write them on the doorposts of your house and on your city gates.
Deuteronomy,6,10,"“When the LORD your God brings you into the land he swore to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that he would give you — a land with large and beautiful cities that you did not build"
Deuteronomy,6,11,"and houses full of all good things, which thou filledst not, and wells digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards and olive trees, which thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten and be full"
Deuteronomy,6,12,"be careful not to forget the LORD who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the place of slavery."
Deuteronomy,6,13,"Fear the LORD your God, worship him, and take your oaths in his name."
Deuteronomy,6,14,"Do not follow other gods, the gods of the peoples around you"

Deuteronomy,6,22,"Before our eyes the LORD inflicted great and devastating signs and wonders on Egypt, on Pharaoh, and on all his household"

Deuteronomy,7,2,"and when the LORD your God delivers them over to you and you defeat them, you must completely destroy them. Make no treaty with them and show them no mercy."
Deuteronomy,7,3,"You must not intermarry with them, and you must not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons"
Deuteronomy,7,4,"because they will turn your sons away from me to worship other gods. Then the LORD’s anger will burn against you, and he will swiftly destroy you."
Deuteronomy,7,5,"Instead, this is what you are to do to them: tear down their altars, smash their sacred pillars, cut down their Asherah poles, and burn their carved images."
Deuteronomy,7,6,For you are a holy people belonging to the LORD your God. The LORD your God has chosen you to be his own possession out of all the peoples on the face of the earth.

Deuteronomy,7,17,"“If you say to yourself, ‘These nations are greater than I; how can I drive them out?’"
Deuteronomy,7,18,do not be afraid of them. Be sure to remember what the LORD your God did to Pharaoh and all Egypt

Deuteronomy,9,17,"So I took hold of the two tablets and threw them from my hands, shattering them before your eyes."
Deuteronomy,9,18,"I fell down like the first time in the presence of the LORD for forty days and forty nights; I did not eat food or drink water because of all the sin you committed, doing what was evil in the LORD’s sight and angering him."

Deuteronomy,9,28,"Otherwise, those in the land you brought us from will say, ‘Because the LORD wasn’t able to bring them into the land he had promised them, and because he hated them, he brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.’"
Deuteronomy,9,29,"But they are your people, your inheritance, whom you brought out by your great power and outstretched arm."

Deuteronomy,14,24,"But if the distance is too great for you to carry it, since the place where the LORD your God chooses to put his name is too far away from you and since the LORD your God has blessed you"
Deuteronomy,14,25,"then exchange it for silver, take the silver in your hand, and go to the place the LORD your God chooses."

Deuteronomy,15,1,“At the end of every seven years you must cancel debts.
Deuteronomy,15,2,"This is how to cancel debt: Every creditor is to cancel what he has lent his neighbor. He is not to collect anything from his neighbor or brother, because the LORD’s release of debts has been proclaimed."

Deuteronomy,18,15,“The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own brothers. You must listen to him.

Deuteronomy,19,6,"Otherwise, the avenger of blood in the heat of his anger might pursue the one who committed manslaughter, overtake him because the distance is great, and strike him dead. Yet he did not deserve to die, since he did not previously hate his neighbor."

Deuteronomy,19,17,the two people in the dispute are to stand in the presence of the LORD before the priests and judges in authority at that time.
Deuteronomy,19,18,"The judges are to make a careful investigation, and if the witness turns out to be a liar who has falsely accused his brother"

Deuteronomy,20,12,"However, if it does not make peace with you but wages war against you, lay siege to it."
Deuteronomy,20,13,"When the LORD your God hands it over to you, strike down all its males with the sword."
Deuteronomy,20,14,"But you may take the women, dependents, animals, and whatever else is in the city — all its spoil — as plunder. You may enjoy the spoil of your enemies that the LORD your God has given you."
Deuteronomy,20,15,This is how you are to treat all the cities that are far away from you and are not among the cities of these nations.
Deuteronomy,20,16,"However, you must not let any living thing survive among the cities of these people the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance."
Deuteronomy,20,17,"You must completely destroy them — the Hethite, Amorite, Canaanite, Perizzite, Hivite, and Jebusite — as the LORD your God has commanded you"
Deuteronomy,20,18,"so that they won’t teach you to do all the detestable acts they do for their gods, and you sin against the LORD your God."
Deuteronomy,20,19,"“When you lay siege to a city for a long time, fighting against it in order to capture it, do not destroy its trees by putting an ax to them, because you can get food from them. Do not cut them down. Are trees of the field human, to come under siege by you?"

Deuteronomy,21,19,"his father and mother are to take hold of him and bring him to the elders of his city, to the gate of his hometown."
Deuteronomy,21,20,"They will say to the elders of his city, ‘This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious; he doesn’t obey us. He’s a glutton and a drunkard.’"

Deuteronomy,22,17,"He has accused her of shameful conduct, saying, “I didn’t find any evidence of your daughter’s virginity,” but here is the evidence of my daughter’s virginity.’ They will spread out the cloth before the city elders."
Deuteronomy,22,18,Then the elders of that city will take the man and punish him.
Deuteronomy,22,19,"They will also fine him a hundred silver shekels and give them to the young woman’s father, because that man gave an Israelite virgin a bad name. She will remain his wife; he cannot divorce her as long as he lives."
Deuteronomy,22,20,But if this accusation is true and no evidence of the young woman’s virginity is found
Deuteronomy,22,21,"they will bring the woman to the door of her father’s house, and the men of her city will stone her to death. For she has committed an outrage in Israel by being promiscuous while living in her father’s house. You must purge the evil from you."

Deuteronomy,22,24,take the two of them out to the gate of that city and stone them to death — the young woman because she did not cry out in the city and the man because he has violated his neighbor’s fiancée. You must purge the evil from you.
Deuteronomy,22,25,"But if the man encounters an engaged woman in the open country, and he seizes and rapes her, only the man who raped her must die."
Deuteronomy,22,26,"Do nothing to the young woman, because she is not guilty of an offense deserving death. This case is just like one in which a man attacks his neighbor and murders him."
Deuteronomy,22,27,"When he found her in the field, the engaged woman cried out, but there was no one to rescue her."

Deuteronomy,29,22,“Future generations of your children who follow you and the foreigner who comes from a distant country will see the plagues of that land and the sicknesses the LORD has inflicted on it.
Deuteronomy,29,23,"All its soil will be a burning waste of sulfur and salt, unsown, producing nothing, with no plant growing on it, just like the fall of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which the LORD demolished in his fierce anger."
Deuteronomy,29,24,"All the nations will ask, ‘Why has the LORD done this to this land? Why this intense outburst of anger?’"
Deuteronomy,29,25,"Then people will answer, ‘It is because they abandoned the covenant of the LORD, the God of their ancestors, which he had made with them when he brought them out of the land of Egypt."
Deuteronomy,29,26,"They began to serve other gods, bowing in worship to gods they had not known  — gods that the LORD had not permitted them to worship."
Deuteronomy,29,27,"Therefore the LORD’s anger burned against this land, and he brought every curse written in this book on it."
Deuteronomy,29,28,"The LORD uprooted them from their land in his anger, rage, and intense wrath, and threw them into another land where they are today.’"
Deuteronomy,29,29,"The hidden things belong to the LORD our God, but the revealed things belong to us and our children forever, so that we may follow all the words of this law."
Deuteronomy,30,1,“When all these things happen to you — the blessings and curses I have set before you — and you come to your senses while you are in all the nations where the LORD your God has driven you
Deuteronomy,30,2,and you and your children return to the LORD your God and obey him with all your heart and all your soul by doing everything I am commanding you today
Deuteronomy,30,3,"then he will restore your fortunes, have compassion on you, and gather you again from all the peoples where the LORD your God has scattered you."
Deuteronomy,30,4,"Even if your exiles are at the farthest horizon, he will gather you and bring you back from there."
Deuteronomy,30,5,"The LORD your God will bring you into the land your ancestors possessed, and you will take possession of it. He will cause you to prosper and multiply you more than he did your ancestors."
Deuteronomy,30,6,"The LORD your God will circumcise your heart and the hearts of your descendants, and you will love him with all your heart and all your soul so that you will live."
Deuteronomy,30,7,The LORD your God will put all these curses on your enemies who hate and persecute you.
Deuteronomy,30,8,Then you will again obey him and follow all his commands I am commanding you today.
Deuteronomy,30,9,"The LORD your God will make you prosper abundantly in all the work of your hands, your offspring, the offspring of your livestock, and the produce of your land. Indeed, the LORD will again delight in your prosperity, as he delighted in that of your ancestors"
Deuteronomy,30,10,when you obey the LORD your God by keeping his commands and statutes that are written in this book of the law and return to him with all your heart and all your soul.
Deuteronomy,30,11,“This command that I give you today is certainly not too difficult or beyond your reach.
Deuteronomy,30,12,"It is not in heaven so that you have to ask, ‘Who will go up to heaven, get it for us, and proclaim it to us so that we may follow it?’"
Deuteronomy,30,13,"And it is not across the sea so that you have to ask, ‘Who will cross the sea, get it for us, and proclaim it to us so that we may follow it?’"
Deuteronomy,30,14,"But the message is very near you, in your mouth and in your heart, so that you may follow it."
Deuteronomy,30,15,"See, today I have set before you life and prosperity, death and adversity."
Deuteronomy,30,16,"For I am commanding you today to love the LORD your God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commands, statutes, and ordinances, so that you may live and multiply, and the LORD your God may bless you in the land you are entering to possess."
Deuteronomy,30,17,But if your heart turns away and you do not listen and you are led astray to bow in worship to other gods and serve them
Deuteronomy,30,18,I tell you today that you will certainly perish and will not prolong your days in the land you are entering to possess across the Jordan.
Deuteronomy,30,19,"I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you today that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse. Choose life so that you and your descendants may live"
Deuteronomy,30,20,"love the LORD your God, obey him, and remain faithful to him. For he is your life, and he will prolong your days as you live in the land the LORD swore to give to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”"
Deuteronomy,31,1,Then Moses continued to speak these words to all Israel
Deuteronomy,31,2,"saying, “I am now 120 years old; I can no longer act as your leader. The LORD has told me, ‘You will not cross the Jordan.’"
Deuteronomy,31,3,"The LORD your God is the one who will cross ahead of you. He will destroy these nations before you, and you will drive them out. Joshua is the one who will cross ahead of you, as the LORD has said."
Deuteronomy,31,4,"The LORD will deal with them as he did Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, and their land when he destroyed them."
Deuteronomy,31,5,"The LORD will deliver them over to you, and you must do to them exactly as I have commanded you."
Deuteronomy,31,6,Be strong and courageous; don’t be terrified or afraid of them. For the LORD your God is the one who will go with you; he will not leave you or abandon you.”
Deuteronomy,31,7,"Moses then summoned Joshua and said to him in the sight of all Israel, “Be strong and courageous, for you will go with this people into the land the LORD swore to give to their ancestors. You will enable them to take possession of it."
Deuteronomy,31,8,The LORD is the one who will go before you. He will be with you; he will not leave you or abandon you. Do not be afraid or discouraged.”
Deuteronomy,31,9,"Moses wrote down this law and gave it to the priests, the sons of Levi, who carried the ark of the LORD’s covenant, and to all the elders of Israel."
Deuteronomy,31,10,"Moses commanded them, “At the end of every seven years, at the appointed time in the year of debt cancellation, during the Festival of Shelters"
Deuteronomy,31,11,"when all Israel assembles in the presence of the LORD your God at the place he chooses, you are to read this law aloud before all Israel."
Deuteronomy,31,12,"Gather the people — men, women, dependents, and the resident aliens within your city gates — so that they may listen and learn to fear the LORD your God and be careful to follow all the words of this law."
Deuteronomy,31,13,Then their children who do not know the law will listen and learn to fear the LORD your God as long as you live in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess.”
Deuteronomy,31,14,"The LORD said to Moses, “The time of your death is now approaching. Call Joshua and present yourselves at the tent of meeting so that I may commission him.” When Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves at the tent of meeting"
Deuteronomy,31,15,"the LORD appeared at the tent in a pillar of cloud, and the cloud stood at the entrance to the tent."
Deuteronomy,31,16,"The LORD said to Moses, “You are about to rest with your ancestors, and these people will soon prostitute themselves with the foreign gods of the land they are entering. They will abandon me and break the covenant I have made with them."
Deuteronomy,31,17,"My anger will burn against them on that day; I will abandon them and hide my face from them so that they will become easy prey. Many troubles and afflictions will come to them. On that day they will say, ‘Haven’t these troubles come to us because our God is no longer with us?’"
Deuteronomy,31,18,I will certainly hide my face on that day because of all the evil they have done by turning to other gods.
Deuteronomy,31,19,"Therefore write down this song for yourselves and teach it to the Israelites; have them sing it, so that this song may be a witness for me against the Israelites."
Deuteronomy,31,20,"When I bring them into the land I swore to give their ancestors, a land flowing with milk and honey, they will eat their fill and prosper. They will turn to other gods and worship them, despising me and breaking my covenant."
Deuteronomy,31,21,"And when many troubles and afflictions come to them, this song will testify against them, because their descendants will not have forgotten it. For I know what they are prone to do, even before I bring them into the land I swore to give them.”"
Deuteronomy,31,22,So Moses wrote down this song on that day and taught it to the Israelites.
Deuteronomy,31,23,"The LORD commissioned Joshua son of Nun, “Be strong and courageous, for you will bring the Israelites into the land I swore to them, and I will be with you.”"
Deuteronomy,31,24,When Moses had finished writing down on a scroll every single word of this law
Deuteronomy,31,25,he commanded the Levites who carried the ark of the LORD’s covenant
Deuteronomy,31,26,“Take this book of the law and place it beside the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God so that it may remain there as a witness against you.
Deuteronomy,31,27,"For I know how rebellious and stiff-necked you are. If you are rebelling against the LORD now, while I am still alive, how much more will you rebel after I am dead!"
Deuteronomy,31,28,Assemble all your tribal elders and officers before me so that I may speak these words directly to them and call heaven and earth as witnesses against them.
Deuteronomy,31,29,"For I know that after my death you will become completely corrupt and turn from the path I have commanded you. Disaster will come to you in the future, because you will do what is evil in the LORD’s sight, angering him with what your hands have made.”"
Deuteronomy,31,30,Then Moses recited aloud every single word of this song to the entire assembly of Israel
Deuteronomy,32,1,"Pay attention, heavens, and I will speak;
listen, earth, to the words from my mouth."
Deuteronomy,32,2,"Let my teaching fall like rain
and my word settle like dew,
like gentle rain on new grass
and showers on tender plants."
Deuteronomy,32,3,"For I will proclaim the LORD’s name.
Declare the greatness of our God!"

all his ways are just.

you foolish and senseless people?
Isn’t he your Father and Creator?

consider the years of past generations.
Ask your father, and he will tell you,
your elders, and they will teach you."

and divided the human race,
he set the boundaries of the peoples
according to the number of the people of Israel."
Deuteronomy,32,9,"But the LORD’s portion is his people,
Jacob, his own inheritance."
Deuteronomy,32,10,"He found him in a desolate land,
in a barren, howling wilderness;
he surrounded him, cared for him,
and protected him as the pupil of his eye."
Deuteronomy,32,11,"He watches over his nest like an eagle
and hovers over his young;
he spreads his wings, catches him,
and carries him on his feathers."
Deuteronomy,32,12,"The LORD alone led him,
with no help from a foreign god."
Deuteronomy,32,13,"He made him ride on the heights of the land
and eat the produce of the field.
He nourished him with honey from the rock
and oil from flinty rock"
Deuteronomy,32,14,"curds from the herd and milk from the flock,
with the fat of lambs,
rams from Bashan, and goats,
with the choicest grains of wheat;
you drank wine from the finest grapes."
Deuteronomy,32,15,"Then Jeshurun became fat and rebelled —
you became fat, bloated, and gorged.
He abandoned the God who made him
and scorned the Rock of his salvation."
Deuteronomy,32,16,"They provoked his jealousy with different gods;
they enraged him with detestable practices."
Deuteronomy,32,17,"They sacrificed to demons, not God,
to gods they had not known,
new gods that had just arrived,
which your ancestors did not fear."
Deuteronomy,32,18,"You ignored the Rock who gave you birth;
you forgot the God who gave birth to you."
Deuteronomy,32,19,"When the LORD saw this, he despised them,
angered by his sons and daughters."
Deuteronomy,32,20,"He said, “I will hide my face from them;
I will see what will become of them,
for they are a perverse generation —
unfaithful children."
Deuteronomy,32,21,"They have provoked my jealousy
with what is not a god;
they have enraged me with their worthless idols.
So I will provoke their jealousy
with what is not a people;
I will enrage them with a foolish nation."
Deuteronomy,32,22,"For fire has been kindled because of my anger
and burns to the depths of Sheol;
it devours the land and its produce,

Deuteronomy,32,23,"“I will pile disasters on them;
I will use up my arrows against them."

and inside, there will be terror;
the young man and the young woman will be killed,
the infant and the gray-haired man."
Deuteronomy,32,26,"“I would have said: I will cut them to pieces
and blot out the memory of them from mankind"
Deuteronomy,32,27,"if I had not feared provocation from the enemy,
or feared that these foes might misunderstand
and say, ‘Our own hand has prevailed;
it wasn’t the LORD who did all this.’”"
Deuteronomy,32,28,"Israel is a nation lacking sense
with no understanding at all."
Deuteronomy,32,29,"If only they were wise, they would comprehend this;
they would understand their fate."
Deuteronomy,32,30,"How could one pursue a thousand,
or two put ten thousand to flight,
unless their Rock had sold them,
unless the LORD had given them up?"
Deuteronomy,32,31,"But their “rock” is not like our Rock,
as even our enemies concede."
Deuteronomy,32,32,"For their vine is from the vine of Sodom
and from the fields of Gomorrah.
Their grapes are poisonous;

sealed up in my vaults?"

and no one is left — slave or free."

Let them rise up and help you;
let it be a shelter for you."

Deuteronomy,32,47,"For they are not meaningless words to you but they are your life, and by them you will live long in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess.”"

Deuteronomy,32,49,"“Go up Mount Nebo in the Abarim range in the land of Moab, across from Jericho, and view the land of Canaan I am giving the Israelites as a possession."
Deuteronomy,32,50,"Then you will die on the mountain that you go up, and you will be gathered to your people, just as your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people."
