Shmuel Alef,1,1,"Now there was a certain man of Ramatayim Tzophim, of the hill country of Ephrayim, and his name was Elkanah ben Yerocham ben Elihu ben Tochu ben Tzuph, from Ephrat;"
Shmuel Alef,1,2,"And he had two wives; the name of the one was Channah, and the name of the other Peninnah; and Peninnah had children, but Channah had no children."
Shmuel Alef,1,3,"And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto Hashem Tzva'os in Shiloh. And the two banim of Eli, Chophni and Pinchas, the kohanim of Hashem , were there."
Shmuel Alef,1,4,"And when the time was that Elkanah offered sacrifice, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her banim and her banot, portions;"
Shmuel Alef,1,5,But unto Channah he gave a double portion; for he loved Channah; but Hashem had shut up her womb.
Shmuel Alef,1,6,"And her tzarah (adversary) also provoked her greatly, for to make her fret, because Hashem had shut up her womb."
Shmuel Alef,1,7,"And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the Bais Hashem , so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat."
Shmuel Alef,1,8,"Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Channah, why weepest thou? And why eatest thou not? And why is thy lev bitter? Am not I better to thee than asarah banim?"
Shmuel Alef,1,9,"So Channah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli HaKohen sat upon a chair by mezuzat Heikhal Hashem."
Shmuel Alef,1,10,"And she was in bitterness of nefesh, and davened unto Hashem , and wept greatly."
Shmuel Alef,1,11,"And she vowed a neder (vow) , and said, O Hashem Tzva'os, if thou wilt indeed look on the misery of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid zera anashim, then I will give him unto Hashem kol yamei of his chayyah, and there shall no razor come upon his head."
Shmuel Alef,1,12,"And it came to pass, as she continued davening before Hashem , that Eli observed her mouth."
Shmuel Alef,1,13,"Now Channah, she davened in her lev; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard; therefore Eli thought her to be shikkorah."
Shmuel Alef,1,14,"And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunk? Put away thy yayin from thee."
Shmuel Alef,1,15,"And Channah answered and said, No, adoni, I am an isha of a keshat ruach (oppressed spirit) ; I have drunk neither yayin nor strong drink, but have poured out my nefesh before Hashem."
Shmuel Alef,1,16,"Take not thine amah (handmaid, servant) for a bat Beliyaal; for out of the abundance of my anguish and ka'as (grief) have I davened hitherto."
Shmuel Alef,1,17,"Then Eli answered and said, Go in shalom; and Elohei Yisroel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of Him."
Shmuel Alef,1,18,"And she said, Let thine handmaid find chen (grace, favor) in thy sight. So the isha went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad."
Shmuel Alef,1,19,"And they rose up in the boker early, and worshiped before Hashem and returned, and came to their bais in Ramah; and Elkanah knew Channah his wife; and Hashem remembered her."
Shmuel Alef,1,20,"And it came to pass in due time, after Channah had conceived, that she bore a ben, and called his name Shmuel (Heard of G-d) saying, Because from Hashem I have asked for him."
Shmuel Alef,1,21,"And the man Elkanah, and all his bais, went up to offer unto Hashem the zevach hayamim (sacrifice of the days) , and his neder (vow)."
Shmuel Alef,1,22,"But Channah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before Hashem , and there abide forever."
Shmuel Alef,1,23,"And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only Hashem make good (establish) His devar. So the isha stayed, and nursed her ben until she weaned him."
Shmuel Alef,1,24,"And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bulls, and one ephah of flour, and a skin of yayin, and brought him unto the Bais Hashem in Shiloh; and the child was young."
Shmuel Alef,1,25,"And they slaughtered a bull, and brought the child to Eli."
Shmuel Alef,1,26,"And she said, Oh adoni, as thy nefesh liveth, adoni, I am the isha that stood by thee here, davening unto Hashem."
Shmuel Alef,1,27,For this child I davened; and Hashem hath given me my petition which I asked of Him;
Shmuel Alef,1,28,Therefore also I make him one lent to Hashem ; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to Hashem . And he worshiped Hashem there.
Shmuel Alef,2,1,"And Channah davened, and said, My lev rejoiceth in Hashem , mine keren is exalted in Hashem ; my mouth is opened wide over mine oyevim; because I rejoice with simchah in Thy Yeshu'ah (Salvation)."
Shmuel Alef,2,2,There is none kadosh like Hashem ; for there is none besides Thee; neither is there any Tzur like Eloheinu.
Shmuel Alef,2,3,"Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not atak (insolence) come out of your mouth; for Hashem is El De'ot (a G-d who intensively knows) , and by Him alilot (actions) are weighed."
Shmuel Alef,2,4,"Keshet gibborim are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with chayil (strength)."
Shmuel Alef,2,5,They that were full have hired out themselves for lechem; and they that were hungry are such no more; so that the barren hath born shivah; and she that hath rabbat banim withers in grief.
Shmuel Alef,2,6," Hashem bringeth mot, and maketh chayyim; He bringeth down to Sheol, and raiseth up."
Shmuel Alef,2,7," Hashem maketh poor, and bringeth oisher; He bringeth low, and lifteth up."
Shmuel Alef,2,8,"He raiseth up the dal (poor) out of the aphar (dust) , and lifteth up the evyon (needy) from the dunghill, to seat them among nedivim (nobles) , and to make them inherit the kisse kavod; for the pillars of the earth belong to Hashem , and He hath set the tevel (world) upon them."
Shmuel Alef,2,9,"He is shomer over the feet of His chasidim, and the resha'im shall be silenced in choshech; for by ko'ach shall no ish prevail."
Shmuel Alef,2,10,"Those striving against Hashem shall be shattered; out of Shomayim shall He thunder upon him; Hashem shall judge the afsei eretz (ends of the earth) ; and He shall give oz (strength) unto His Melech, and exalt the keren (horn, power) of His Moshiach."
Shmuel Alef,2,11,And Elkanah went to Ramah to his bais. And the na'ar was mesharet (minister) unto Hashem under Eli HaKohen.
Shmuel Alef,2,12,Now the Bnei Eli were Bnei Beliyaal; they knew not Hashem.
Shmuel Alef,2,13,"And the mishpat hakohanim (kohen ºs custom) with the people was, that, when any ish offered zevach, the na'ar hakohen came, while the basar was cooking, with a mazleg (fork) of shlosh hashineayim (three prongs, lit. teeth) in his yad;"
Shmuel Alef,2,14,And he would plunge it into the kiyyor (basin) or dud (kettle) or kalakhat (caldron) or parur (pot) ; all that the mazleg brought up the kohen took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto kol Yisroel that came there.
Shmuel Alef,2,15,"Also before they burned the chelev, the na'ar hakohen came, and said to the ish hazove'ach (man making the sacrifice) , Give basar to roast for the kohen; for he will not accept cooked basar of thee, only raw."
Shmuel Alef,2,16,"And if any ish said unto him, Let them first not fail to burn the chelev, and then take as much as thy nefesh desireth; then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt hand it over to me now; and if not, I will take it by chazakah (force)."
Shmuel Alef,2,17,Wherefore the chattat hane'arim was gedolah me'od before Hashem ; for the anashim treated with contempt the minchat Hashem.
Shmuel Alef,2,18,"But Shmuel was mesharet (minister) before Hashem , being a na'ar, girded with an ephod bad (linen robe)."
Shmuel Alef,2,19,"Moreover immo made him a me'il katon (a little robe) , and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her ish to offer the zevach hayamim (yearly or annual sacrifice)."
Shmuel Alef,2,20,"And Eli put on Elkanah and his isha a brocha, and said, Hashem give thee zera of this isha in place of the she'elah (asked for [one] of) Hashem that was lent. And they went unto his makom (place, home)."
Shmuel Alef,2,21,"And Hashem visited Channah, so that she conceived, and bore three banim and two banot. And the na'ar Shmuel grew before Hashem."
Shmuel Alef,2,22,"Now Eli was zaken me'od, and heard all that his banim did unto kol Yisroel; and how they lay with the nashim hatzove'ot (women in ministry service) at the petach Ohel Mo'ed."
Shmuel Alef,2,23,"And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? For I hear of your evil deeds from kol HaAm (all the People)."
Shmuel Alef,2,24,"Nay, my banim; for it is no good report that I hear; ye make Am Hashem to transgress."
Shmuel Alef,2,25,"If one ish sin against another ish, Elohim shall intervene as arbiter for him; but if an ish sin against Hashem , who shall entreat for him? Notwithstanding they paid heed not unto the kol avihem (voice of their father) , because Hashem willed to execute them."
Shmuel Alef,2,26,"And the na'ar Shmuel was growing, and was in favor both with Hashem and also with anashim."
Shmuel Alef,2,27,"And there came an Ish Elohim unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith Hashem , Did I not plainly reveal Myself unto the Bais Avicha, when they were in Mitzrayim under Bais Pharaoh?"
Shmuel Alef,2,28,"And did I not choose him out of kol Shivtei Yisroel to be Kohen to Me, to ascend Mine Mizbe'ach, to burn ketoret, to wear an Ephod in My presence? And did I give unto the Bais Avicha all the fire offerings of the Bnei Yisroel?"
Shmuel Alef,2,29,"Why kick scornfully at My zevach and My minchah, which I have commanded in My ma'on (habitation, dwelling); and honorest thy banim above Me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of kol minchat Yisroel, before Ami (My People)."
Shmuel Alef,2,30,"Therefore Hashem Elohei Yisroel saith, I said indeed that thy Bais, and the Bais Avicha, should walk before Me ad olam (forever) ; but now Hashem saith, Be it far from Me; for them that honor Me I will honor, and they that despise Me shall be lightly esteemed."
Shmuel Alef,2,31,"Hinei, the yamim are coming, that I will cut off thine zero'a, and the zero'a of the Bais Avicha, that there shall not be a zaken in thine Bais."
Shmuel Alef,2,32,And thou shalt see Tzar Ma'on in spite of all that He will do of tov to Yisroel; and there shall not be a zaken in thine Bais kol hayamim.
Shmuel Alef,2,33,"And the ish of thine, whom I shall not cut off from Mine Mizbe'ach, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine nefesh; and all the increase of thine Bais shall die anashim."
Shmuel Alef,2,34,"And this shall be HaOt unto thee, that shall come upon thy two banim, on Chophni and on Pinchas: in one day they shall die both of them."
Shmuel Alef,2,35,"And I will raise up for Me a Kohen Ne'eman, that shall do according to that which is in Mine lev and in My nefesh; and I will build for him a Bais Ne'eman; and he shall walk before Mine Moshiach kol hayamim."
Shmuel Alef,2,36,"And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine Bais shall come and bow before him to get an agorat kesef (a silver coin) and a kikar lechem (loaf of bread) , and shall say, Put me please into one of the Kehunnot (Divisions of the Kehunah) , that I may get a piece of lechem to eat."
Shmuel Alef,3,1,"And the na'ar Shmuel ministered unto Hashem before Eli. And the Devar Hashem was yakar (precious, dear, rare) in those days; there was no chazon nifratz [prophetic] vision open, spread out, common."
Shmuel Alef,3,2,"And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was lying down in his makom (his eyes had began to grow dim, that he could not see);"
Shmuel Alef,3,3,"And the Ner Elohim had not yet gone out in the Heikhal Hashem , where the Aron Elohim was, and Shmuel was lying down;"
Shmuel Alef,3,4,"That Hashem called Shmuel; and he answered, Hineni."
Shmuel Alef,3,5,"And he ran unto Eli, and said, Hineni; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down."
Shmuel Alef,3,6,"And Hashem called yet again, Shmuel. And Shmuel got up and went to Eli, and said, Hineni; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, beni; lie down again."
Shmuel Alef,3,7,Now Shmuel did not yet know Hashem ; the Devar Hashem was not yet revealed unto him.
Shmuel Alef,3,8,"And Hashem called Shmuel again the third time. And he got up and went to Eli, and said, Hineni; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that Hashem was calling the na'ar."
Shmuel Alef,3,9,"Therefore Eli said unto Shmuel, Go, lie down; and it shall be, if He call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Hashem ; for Thy eved (servant) shomei'a (is listening) . So Shmuel went and lay down in his makom."
Shmuel Alef,3,10,"And Hashem came, and stood, and called as at other times, Shmuel, Shmuel. Then Shmuel answered, Speak; for Thy eved shomei'a."
Shmuel Alef,3,11,"And Hashem said to Shmuel, Hinei, I am doing a thing in Yisroel, at which both the oznayim of every one that heareth it shall tingle."
Shmuel Alef,3,12,In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his Bais; from beginning even to the end.
Shmuel Alef,3,13,"For I have told him that I will judge his Bais ad olam for the avon (iniquity) which he knoweth; because his banim brought klalot (curses) upon themselves, and he restrained them not."
Shmuel Alef,3,14,"And therefore I have sworn unto the Bais Eli, that there shall be no kapporah for the avon Bais Eli by zevach nor minchah ad olam."
Shmuel Alef,3,15,"And Shmuel lay until boker, and opened the dlatot Beis Hashem . And Shmuel feared to show Eli the mareh (vision)."
Shmuel Alef,3,16,"Then Eli called Shmuel, and said, Shmuel, beni. And he answered, Hineni."
Shmuel Alef,3,17,"And he said, What is the davar that Hashem hath said unto thee? Now hide it not from me; Elohim do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide anything from me of all the things that He said unto thee."
Shmuel Alef,3,18,"And Shmuel told him everything, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is Hashem ; let Him do what seemeth Him tov."
Shmuel Alef,3,19,"And Shmuel grew, and Hashem was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground."
Shmuel Alef,3,20,And kol Yisroel from Dan even to Be'er-Sheva knew that Shmuel was established to be a navi of Hashem.
Shmuel Alef,3,21,And Hashem appeared again in Shiloh; for Hashem revealed Himself to Shmuel in Shiloh by the Devar Hashem.
Shmuel Alef,4,1,"And the davar Shmuel came to kol Yisroel. Now Yisroel went out to meet in milchamah the Pelishtim (Philistines) , and encamped at Even-Ezer; and the Pelishtim (Philistines) encamped at Aphek."
Shmuel Alef,4,2,"And the Pelishtim (Philistines) put themselves in array to meet Yisroel [in battle]; and when the milchamah spread, Yisroel was defeated before the Pelishtim; and they slaughtered on the ma'arakhah (battleground) in the sadeh about arba'at alafim ish (four thousand men)."
Shmuel Alef,4,3,"And when HaAm were come into the machaneh, the Ziknei Yisroel said, Why hath Hashem defeated us today before the Pelishtim (Philistines) ? Let us bring the Aron Brit Hashem out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the palm of oyeveinu (our enemies)."
Shmuel Alef,4,4,"So HaAm sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from there the Aron Brit Hashem Tzva'os, Who dwelleth between the keruvim; and the two Bnei Eli, Chophni and Pinchas, were there with the Aron Brit HaElohim."
Shmuel Alef,4,5,"And when the Aron Brit Hashem came into the machaneh, kol Yisroel shouted with a teru'ah gedolah, so that ha'aretz shook."
Shmuel Alef,4,6,"And when the Pelishtim (Philistines) heard the kol hateruah, they said, What meaneth kol hateruah hagedolah hazot in the machaneh HaIvrit? And they understood that the Aron Hashem was come into the machaneh."
Shmuel Alef,4,7,"And the Pelishtim (Philistines) were afraid, for they said, elohim is come into the machaneh. And they said, Oy lanu! For there hath not been such a thing as this heretofore."
Shmuel Alef,4,8,Oy lanu! Who shall save us out of the yad of these elohim ha'adirim (mighty g-ds) ? These are the g-ds that struck the Mitzrayim with kol makkah (all the plagues) in the midbar.
Shmuel Alef,4,9,"Be strong and conduct yourselves like anashim, O ye Pelishtim (Philistines) , that ye be not avadim unto the Ivrim (Hebrews) , as they have been subject to you; conduct yourselves like anashim, and fight."
Shmuel Alef,4,10,"And the Pelishtim fought, and Yisroel was defeated, and they fled every ish into his ohel; and there was makkah gedolah me'od (a very great slaughter) ; for there fell of Yisroel shloshim elef foot soldiers."
Shmuel Alef,4,11,"And the Aron Elohim was captured; and the two Bnei Eli, Chophni and Pinchas, died."
Shmuel Alef,4,12,"And there ran an ish of Binyamin out of the ma'arakhah (battleground) , and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes torn, and with adamah upon his rosh."
Shmuel Alef,4,13,"And when he arrived, hinei, Eli sat upon a kisse by the side of the derech, watching; for his lev anxiously trembled for the Aron HaElohim. And when the ish came into the Ir [of Shiloh], and told it, kol HaIr cried out."
Shmuel Alef,4,14,"And when Eli heard the sound of the outcry, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the ish came in hastily, and told Eli."
Shmuel Alef,4,15,"Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were kamah (set, stiff, fixed motionless) , that he could not see."
Shmuel Alef,4,16,"And the ish said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the ma'arakhah (battle-ground) , and I fled today from the ma'arakhah. And he said, What happened there, beni?"
Shmuel Alef,4,17,"And the mevaser (herald, bringer of news, bearer of tidings, evangelist) answered and said, Yisroel is fled before the Pelishtim, and there hath been also a magefah gedolah among HaAm, and thy two banim also, Chophni and Pinchas, are dead, and the Aron HaElohim is captured."
Shmuel Alef,4,18,"And it came to pass, when he made mention of the Aron HaElohim, that he fell from off the kisse backward by the side of the sha'ar, and his neck was broken, and he died; for the ish was zaken (old) and kaved (heavy) . And he had judged Yisroel arba'im shanah."
Shmuel Alef,4,19,"And his kallah (daughter-in-law) , eshet Pinchas, was with child, near to be delivered; and when she heard the tidings that the Aron HaElohim was captured, and that her kham (woman ºs father-in-law) and her ish were dead, she fell upon her knees in labor and gave birth; for her labor pains came upon her."
Shmuel Alef,4,20,"And about the time of her mot (death) the attending women said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born ben. But she answered not, neither did her lev pay attention."
Shmuel Alef,4,21,"And she named the na'ar Ikhavod (Inglorious) , saying, The kavod is departed from Yisroel; because the Aron HaElohim is captured, and because of her kham (woman ºs father-in-law) and her ish."
Shmuel Alef,4,22,"And she said, The kavod is departed from Yisroel; for the Aron HaElohim is captured."
Shmuel Alef,5,1,"And the Pelishtim (Philistines) captured the Aron HaElohim, and brought it from Even HaEzer unto Ashdod."
Shmuel Alef,5,2,"When the Pelishtim (Philistines) took the Aron HaElohim, they brought it into the Bais Dagon, and set it beside Dagon."
Shmuel Alef,5,3,"And when they of Ashdod arose early the next day, hinei, Dagon was fallen upon his face on the ground before the Aron Hashem . And they took Dagon, and returned him to his makom."
Shmuel Alef,5,4,"And when they arose baboker on the next day, hinei, Dagon was fallen upon his face on the ground before the Aron Hashem ; and the rosh Dagon and both the kapot (palms) of his hands were cut off upon the miftan (threshold) ; only the trunk of Dagon was left to him."
Shmuel Alef,5,5,"Therefore neither the kohanim of Dagon, nor any that enter Bais Dagon, tread on the miftan (threshold) of Dagon in Ashdod to this day."
Shmuel Alef,5,6,"But the Yad Hashem was heavy upon the Ashdodim, and He brought desolation, and struck them with techorim (tumors) , even Ashdod and the vicinity thereof."
Shmuel Alef,5,7,"And when the anshei Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The Aron Elohei Yisroel shall not abide with us; for His Yad is hard upon us, and upon Dagon eloheinu."
Shmuel Alef,5,8,"They sent therefore and gathered all rulers of the Pelishtim (Philistines) unto them, and said, What shall we do with the Aron Elohei Yisroel? And they answered, Let the Aron Elohei Yisroel be brought about unto Gat. And they brought the Aron Elohei Yisroel about to there."
Shmuel Alef,5,9,"And it was so, that, after they had brought it about, the Yad Hashem was against the Ir with a mehumah gedolah me'od (a very great tumult, commotion) ; and He struck the anshei HaIr, both katon and gadol, so that techorim (tumors) broke out on them."
Shmuel Alef,5,10,"Therefore they sent the Aron HaElohim to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the Aron HaElohim came to Ekron, that the Ekronim cried out, saying, They have brought about the Aron Elohei Yisroel to us, to slay us and our people."
Shmuel Alef,5,11,"So they sent and gathered together all the rulers of the Pelishtim (Philistines) , and said, Send away the Aron Elohei Yisroel, and let it return to its own makom, that it slay us not, and our people; for there was a mehumah (tumult, public panic) of mavet (death) throughout kol HaIr; the Yad HaElohim was very heavy there."
Shmuel Alef,5,12,And the anashim that died not were struck with the techorim (tumors) ; and the outcry of the Ir went up to Shomayim.
Shmuel Alef,6,1,And the Aron Hashem was in the territory of the Pelishtim (Philistines) shivah chodashim.
Shmuel Alef,6,2,"And the Pelishtim (Philistines) called for the kohanim and the kosemim (sorcerers) , saying, What shall we do with the Aron Hashem ? Tell us wherewith we shall send it to its makom (place)."
Shmuel Alef,6,3,"And they said, If ye send away the Aron Elohei Yisroel, send it not away empty; but ye shall surely return to Him an asham (trespass offering) ; then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why His Yad is not removed from you."
Shmuel Alef,6,4,"Then they said, What shall be the asham (trespass offering) which we shall return to Him? They answered, Five techorim of zahav, and five akhbarim (rats) of zahav, according to the number of rulers of the Pelishtim: for one magefah (plague) was on you all, and on your rulers."
Shmuel Alef,6,5,"So ye shall make tzalmei techorim (likenesses of tumors) of yours, and tzalmei akhabarim (likenesses of rats) of yours, of that which mar the land; and ye shall give kavod unto Elohei Yisroel; perhaps He will lighten His Yad from off you, and from off eloheichem (your g-ds) , and from off your land."
Shmuel Alef,6,6,"Now then why do ye harden levavchem, as the Mitzrayim and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When He had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not send them away, so that they departed?"
Shmuel Alef,6,7,"Now therefore make an agalah chadashah (new cart, wagon) , and take two milch cows, on which there hath come no ol (yoke) , and hitch the cows to the agalah, and take their calves home, away from them;"
Shmuel Alef,6,8,"And take the Aron Hashem , and lay it upon the agalah; and put the kelei hazahav, which ye send back to Him for an asham (trespass offering) , in a box by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go."
Shmuel Alef,6,9,"And see: if it goeth up by the derech of its own territory toward Beit-Shemesh, then He hath done us this ra'ah hagedolah (great disaster) ; but if not, then we shall know that it is not His Yad that struck us; the evil came upon us mikreh (by chance, by accident)."
Shmuel Alef,6,10,"And the anashim did so; and took two milch cows, and hitched them to the agalah, and penned up their calves babayit;"
Shmuel Alef,6,11,"And they laid the Aron Hashem upon the agalah, and the box with the akhbarim of zahav and the tzalmei techorim (likenesses of tumors) of theirs."
Shmuel Alef,6,12,"And the cows took the straight derech to the derech Beit-Shemesh, and went along the path, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the yamin or to the semol; and the rulers of the Pelishtim went after them as far as the border of Beit-Shemesh."
Shmuel Alef,6,13,"And they of Beit-Shemesh were kotzerim (harvesting) their ketzir chittim (wheat harvest) in the valley; and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the Aron, and they rejoiced to see it."
Shmuel Alef,6,14,"And the agalah came into the sadeh of Yehoshua, a man of Beit-Shemesh, and stopped there, where there was an even gedolah (a large rock) ; and they chopped up the wood of the agalah, and offered the cows as an olah (burnt offering) unto Hashem."
Shmuel Alef,6,15,"And the Levi'im took down the Aron Hashem , and the box that was with it, wherein were the kelei zahav, and put them on the even hagedolah (large rock) ; and the anashim of Beit-Shemesh offered olot (burnt offerings) and sacrificed zevakhim (sacrifices) on that day unto Hashem."
Shmuel Alef,6,16,"And when the five rulers of the Pelishtim saw it, they returned to Ekron on that same day."
Shmuel Alef,6,17,"And these are the techorim (tumors) of zahav which the Pelishtim (Philistines) returned for an asham (trespass offering) unto Hashem ; for Ashdod one, for Azah (Gaza) one, for Ashkelon one, for Gat one, for Ekron one;"
Shmuel Alef,6,18,"And the akhbarim of zahav, according to the mispar of all the towns of the Pelishtim (Philistines) belonging to the five rulers, both of fortified cities and of country villages, even unto Avel HaGedolah, whereon they set down the Aron Hashem ; it [the even hagedolah] remaineth unto this day in the sadeh of Yehoshua, the man of Beit-Shemesh."
Shmuel Alef,6,19,"And He struck down the anashim of Beit-Shemesh, because they had looked into the Aron Hashem, even He struck down of HaAm shivim ish; and HaAm mourned, because Hashem had struck down many of HaAm with a makkah gedolah (a great stroke, blow)."
Shmuel Alef,6,20,"And the anashim of Beit-Shemesh said, Who is able to stand before Hashem HaElohim HaKadosh Hazeh( Hashem this holy G-d) ? And to whom shall He go up from us?"
Shmuel Alef,6,21,"And they sent malachim to the inhabitants of Kiryat-Ye'arim saying, The Pelishtim (Philistines) have returned the Aron Hashem ; come ye down, and take it up to you."
Shmuel Alef,7,1,"And the anshei Kiryat-Ye'arim came, and took up the Aron Hashem , and brought it into the bais Avinadav on the givah (hill) , and set apart as kodesh El'azar bno to be shomer over the Aron Hashem."
Shmuel Alef,7,2,"And it came to pass, while the Aron abode in Kiryat-Ye'arim, that the time was long; for it was esrim shanah; and kol Bais Yisroel mourned after Hashem."
Shmuel Alef,7,3,"And Shmuel spoke unto kol Bais Yisroel, saying, If ye do return unto Hashem with all your hearts, put away the elohei hanekhar and Ashtarot from among you, commit your hearts unto Hashem , serve Him only; and He will deliver you out of the yad Pelishtim."
Shmuel Alef,7,4,"Then the Bnei Yisroel did put away Ba'alim and Ashtarot, and served Hashem only."
Shmuel Alef,7,5,"And Shmuel said, Gather kol Yisroel to Mitzpah, and I will make intercessory prayer and daven for you unto Hashem."
Shmuel Alef,7,6,"And they gathered together at Mitzpah, and drew mayim, and poured it out before Hashem , and did a tzom on that day, and said there, We have sinned against Hashem . And Shmuel judged the Bnei Yisroel at Mitzpah."
Shmuel Alef,7,7,"And when the Pelishtim heard that the Bnei Yisroel were gathered together at Mitzpah, the rulers of the Pelishtim went up against Yisroel. And when the Bnei Yisroel heard it, they were afraid of the Pelishtim."
Shmuel Alef,7,8,"And the Bnei Yisroel said to Shmuel, Cease not to cry out unto Hashem Eloheinu for us, that He will save us out of the yad Pelishtim."
Shmuel Alef,7,9,"And Shmuel took a suckling lamb, and offered him for an olah unto Hashem ; and Shmuel cried out unto Hashem on behalf of Yisroel; and Hashem answered him."
Shmuel Alef,7,10,"And as Shmuel was offering up the olah, the Pelishtim drew near to battle against Yisroel; but Hashem thundered with a kol gadol on that day upon the Pelishtim, and threw them into confusion and panic; and they were struck down before Yisroel."
Shmuel Alef,7,11,"And the Anshei Yisroel went from Mitzpah, and pursued the Pelishtim, and struck them down, until they came to below Beit-Kar."
Shmuel Alef,7,12,"Then Shmuel took one even (stone) , and set it up between Mitzpah and Shen, and called the shem of it Even-Ezer, saying, Hitherto hath Hashem helped us."
Shmuel Alef,7,13,"So the Pelishtim were subdued, and they came no more into the territory of Yisroel; and the yad Hashem was against the Pelishtim all the days of Shmuel."
Shmuel Alef,7,14,"And the towns which the Pelishtim had captured from Yisroel were restored to Yisroel, from Ekron even unto Gat; and the territory thereof did Yisroel deliver out of the yad Pelishtim. And there was shalom between Yisroel and HaEmori (the Amorites)."
Shmuel Alef,7,15,And Shmuel judged Yisroel all the days of his life.
Shmuel Alef,7,16,"And he went from shanah b'shanah in circuit to Beit-El, and Gilgal, and Mitzpah, and judged Yisroel in all those places."
Shmuel Alef,7,17,And his teshuvah (return) was to Ramah; for there was his bais; and there he judged Yisroel; and there he built a Mizbe'ach unto Hashem.
Shmuel Alef,8,1,"And it came to pass, when Shmuel was old, that he made his banim shofetim over Yisroel."
Shmuel Alef,8,2,"Now the shem of his ben habechor was Yoel; and the shem of his mishneh (second) , Aviyah; they were shofetim at Be'er-Sheva."
Shmuel Alef,8,3,"And his banim walked not in his drakhim, but turned aside after betza (dishonest gain) , and took shochad (bribe[s]) , and perverted mishpat (justice)."
Shmuel Alef,8,4,"Then kol Ziknei Yisroel gathered themselves together, and came to Shmuel unto Ramah,"
Shmuel Alef,8,5,"And said unto him, Hinei, thou art old, and thy banim walk not in thy drakhim; now appoint for us a Melech to judge us like kol HaGoyim."
Shmuel Alef,8,6,"But the thing was displeasing in the eyes of Shmuel, when they said, Give us a Melech to judge us. And Shmuel davened unto Hashem."
Shmuel Alef,8,7,"And Hashem said unto Shmuel, Shema unto the voice of HaAm in all that they say unto thee; for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected Me, that I should not reign as Melech over them."
Shmuel Alef,8,8,"According to all the ma'asim which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Mitzrayim even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken Me, and served elohim acherim, so do they also unto thee."
Shmuel Alef,8,9,"Now therefore pay heed unto their voice; howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and show them the mishpat hamelech (customary ways of the king, kingly perogative) that shall reign over them."
Shmuel Alef,8,10,And Shmuel told all the Divrei Hashem unto the people that asked of him a Melech.
Shmuel Alef,8,11,"And he said, This will be the mishpat hamelech that shall reign over you: he will take your banim, and appoint them for himself for his merkavah and his parashim; and some shall run before his merkavah."
Shmuel Alef,8,12,"And he will appoint for him sarei elafim, and sarei chamishim and will set them to plow his ground, and to reap his katzir (harvest) , and to make his instruments of war, and his chariot equipment."
Shmuel Alef,8,13,"And he will take your banot to be perfumers, and to be tabakhot (cooks) and ofe'ot (bakers)."
Shmuel Alef,8,14,"And he will take your fields, and your kramim (vineyards) , and your olive groves, even the best of them, and give them to his avadim."
Shmuel Alef,8,15,"And he will take the tenth of your zera, and of your kramim (vines) , and give to his officers, and to his avadim."
Shmuel Alef,8,16,"And he will take your avadim, and your shifchot, and your finest bochurim, and your donkeys, and put them to his work."
Shmuel Alef,8,17,He will take the tenth of your tzon; and ye shall be his avadim.
Shmuel Alef,8,18,And ye shall cry out in that day because of your melech which ye shall have chosen for you; and Hashem will not hear you in that day.
Shmuel Alef,8,19,"Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Shmuel; and they said, No; but we will have a Melech over us;"
Shmuel Alef,8,20,"That we also may be like kol HaGoyim; and that our Melech may judge us, and go out before us, and fight milchamoteinu (our battles)."
Shmuel Alef,8,21,"And Shmuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of Hashem."
Shmuel Alef,8,22,"And Hashem said to Shmuel, Pay heed unto their voice, and crown them a Melech. And Shmuel said unto the Anshei Yisroel, Go ye back every ish unto his ir (town)."
Shmuel Alef,9,1,"Now there was an ish of Binyamin, shmo Kish Ben Aviel Ben Tzeror Ben Bechorat Ben Aphiach, an ish of Binyamin, a gibbor chayil (man of valor)."
Shmuel Alef,9,2,"And he had a ben, shmo Sha'ul, a handsome bochur; and there was not among the Bnei Yisroel one more handsome than he; he was head and shoulders taller than kol HaAm."
Shmuel Alef,9,3,"And the donkeys of Kish Avi Sha'ul were lost. And Kish said to Sha'ul bno, Take now one of the ne'arim with thee, and arise, go look for the donkeys."
Shmuel Alef,9,4,"And he passed through har Ephrayim, and passed through Eretz Shalishah, but they found them not; then they passed through Eretz Sha'alim, and they were not there; and he passed through the territory of Binyamin, but they found them not."
Shmuel Alef,9,5,"And when they were come to Eretz Tzuph, Sha'ul said to his na'ar that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest Avi stop caring for the donkeys, and become concerned for us."
Shmuel Alef,9,6,"And he said unto him, Hinei now, there is in this town an Ish Elohim, an ish nikhbad (an honorable man) ; all that he saith cometh surely to pass; now let us go there; perhaps he can show us darkeinu (our way) that we should go."
Shmuel Alef,9,7,"Then said Sha'ul to his na'ar, But, hinei, if we go, what shall we bring the Ish? For the lechem is all gone in our vessels, and there is not a teshurah (gift) for the Ish HaElohim: what have we?"
Shmuel Alef,9,8,"And the na'ar answered Sha'ul again, and said, Hinei, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of kesef; that will I give to the Ish HaElohim, to tell us darkeinu (our way)."
Shmuel Alef,9,9,"Beforetime in Yisroel, when an ish went to inquire of Elohim, thus he spoke, Come, and let us go to the ro'eh (seer) : for he that is now called a navi was beforetime called a ro'eh (seer)."
Shmuel Alef,9,10,"Then said Sha'ul to his na'ar, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the town where the Ish HaElohim was."
Shmuel Alef,9,11,"And as they went up the hill to the town, they found ne'arot (girls) going out to draw mayim, and said unto them, Is the ro'eh here?"
Shmuel Alef,9,12,"And they answered them, and said, He is; hinei, he is ahead of you; make haste now, for he came today to the town; for there is a zevach (sacrifice) for HaAm today in the bamah (high place);"
Shmuel Alef,9,13,"As soon as ye be come into the town, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat; for HaAm will not eat until he come, because hu yevarech hazevach (he doth bless the sacrifice) ; and afterwards hakeru'im (the ones being invited) eat. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him."
Shmuel Alef,9,14,"And they went up into the town; and when they were come into the town, hinei, Shmuel came out toward them as he was going up to the bamah (high place)."
Shmuel Alef,9,15,"Now Hashem galah (had revealed, unveiled) in the ozen (ear) of Shmuel yom echad before Sha'ul came, saying,"
Shmuel Alef,9,16,"Makhar (tomorrow) about this time I will send thee an ish out of Eretz Binyamin, and umeshachto (thou shalt anoint him) to be Nagid over My people Yisroel, that he may save My people out of the yad Pelishtim; for I have looked upon My people, because their cry has come unto Me."
Shmuel Alef,9,17,"And when Shmuel saw Sha'ul, Hashem said unto him, Hinei haIsh whom I spoke to thee of! This same shall rule over My people."
Shmuel Alef,9,18,"Then Sha'ul drew near to Shmuel in the sha'ar, and said, Tell me, now, where is the Bais HaRo'eh."
Shmuel Alef,9,19,"And Shmuel answered Sha'ul, and said, I am the Ro'eh (seer) : go up before me unto the bamah (high place) ; for ye shall eat with me hayom, and baboker I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thine levav."
Shmuel Alef,9,20,"And as for thine donkeys that were lost hayom sheloshet hayamim (now three days) , set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is kol chemdat Yisroel (all the Desire of Yisroel)? Is it not on thee, and on Kol Bais Avicha?"
Shmuel Alef,9,21,"And Sha'ul answered and said, Am not I of Binyamin, of the smallest of the Shivtei Yisroel? And my mishpakhat the least of all the mishpekhot of the Shivtei Binyamin? Wherefore then speakest thou so to me?"
Shmuel Alef,9,22,"And Shmuel took Sha'ul and his na'ar, and brought them into the room, and made them sit at the makom berosh (chief place) among hakeru'im (the ones being invited) , which were about shloshim ish."
Shmuel Alef,9,23,"And Shmuel said unto the tabakh (cook) , Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it aside for thee."
Shmuel Alef,9,24,"And the tabakh took up the shok (thigh piece) , and that which was upon it, and set it before Sha'ul. And Shmuel said, Hinei that which is set aside! Set it before thee, and eat; for unto this mo'ed hath it been set aside for thee since I said, I have invited HaAm. So Sha'ul did eat with Shmuel that day."
Shmuel Alef,9,25,"And when they were come down from the bamah (high place) into the town, Shmuel communed with Sha'ul upon the gag (rooftop)."
Shmuel Alef,9,26,"And they arose early; and it came to pass about shachar, that Shmuel called Sha'ul to the gag (rooftop) , saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Sha'ul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Shmuel, outside."
Shmuel Alef,9,27,"And as they were going down to the outskirts of the town, Shmuel said to Sha'ul, Bid the na'ar pass on before us (and he passed on) , but stand thou still a while, that I may show thee the Devar Elohim."
Shmuel Alef,10,1,"Then Shmuel took a flask of shemen, and poured it upon his rosh, and kissed him, and said, Hath not Hashem meshachacha (anointed thee) to be Nagid over His nachalah?"
Shmuel Alef,10,2,"When thou art departed from me today, then thou shalt find two anashim near Kevurat Rachel on the border of Binyamin at Tzeltzach; and they will say unto thee, The donkeys which thou wentest to seek are found; and, hinei, Avicha hath taken leave of caring about the donkeys, and careth for you, saying, What shall I do for beni (my son)?"
Shmuel Alef,10,3,"Then shalt thou go on forward from there, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tavor, and there shall meet thee shloshah anashim going up to HaElohim to Beit-El, one carrying shloshet gedayim (three young goats) , and another carrying shloshet kikrot (three loaves) lechem, and another carrying a skin of yayin;"
Shmuel Alef,10,4,"And they will give thee a Shalom greeting, and give thee two of the lechem; which thou shalt receive of their yad."
Shmuel Alef,10,5,"After that thou shalt come to the Giveat HaElohim, where is the outpost of the Pelishtim (Philistines) ; and it shall come to pass, when thou art come there to the Ir, that thou shalt meet a chevel (company, band) of nevi'im coming down from the high place with a nevel (lyre) , tof (tambourine) , khalil (flute) , and kinnor (harp) before them; and they shall prophesy;"
Shmuel Alef,10,6,"And the Ruach of Hashem will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be changed into an ish acher (another man, a different man)."
Shmuel Alef,10,7,"And let it be, when these otot (signs) are come unto thee, that thou do what yadecha (thy hand) finds; for HaElohim is with thee."
Shmuel Alef,10,8,"And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, hinei, I will come down unto thee, to offer olot (burnt offerings) , and to sacrifice zivkhei shelamim (sacrifices of peace offerings) ; shivat yamim shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and show thee what thou shalt do."
Shmuel Alef,10,9,"And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Shmuel, Elohim changed for him a lev acher (another heart, a different heart) ; and all those otot (signs) came to pass that day."
Shmuel Alef,10,10,"And when they came there to the Giv'ah (Hill) , hinei, a chevel (company, band) of nevi'im met him; and the Ruach of Elohim came upon him, and he prophesied among them."
Shmuel Alef,10,11,"And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, hinei, he prophesied with the nevi'im, then HaAm said one to another, What is this that hath happened unto the Ben Kish? Is Sha'ul also among the nevi'im?"
Shmuel Alef,10,12,"And an ish from that place answered and said, And who is avihem (their father) ? Therefore it became a mashal (proverb) , Is Sha'ul also among the nevi'im?"
Shmuel Alef,10,13,"And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the bamah (high place)."
Shmuel Alef,10,14,"And the dod Sha'ul said unto him and to his na'ar, Where went ye? And he said, To search for the donkeys; and when we saw that they were nowhere, we came to Shmuel."
Shmuel Alef,10,15,"And the dod Sha'ul said, Tell me, now, what Shmuel said unto you."
Shmuel Alef,10,16,"And Sha'ul said unto his dod, He told us plainly that the donkeys were found. But of the matter of the melukhah (kingship) , whereof Shmuel spoke, he told him not."
Shmuel Alef,10,17,And Shmuel called HaAm together unto Hashem at Mitzpah;
Shmuel Alef,10,18,"And said unto the Bnei Yisroel, Thus saith Hashem Elohei Yisroel, I brought up Yisroel out of Mitzrayim, and delivered you out of the yad Mitzrayim, and out of the yad kol HaMamlachot, and of them that oppressed you;"
Shmuel Alef,10,19,"And ye have this day rejected Eloheichem, who Himself was Moshi'a for you out of all your adversities and your tzoroses; and ye have said unto Him, No, but set a Melech over us. Now therefore present yourselves before Hashem by your Shevatim (Tribes) , and by your alefim (thousands, larger kinship units)."
Shmuel Alef,10,20,"And when Shmuel had caused all the Shivtei Yisroel to come near, the Shevet (Tribe) of Binyamin was lakhad (taken [by lot], singled out [by lot])."
Shmuel Alef,10,21,"When he had caused the Shevet (Tribe) of Binyamin to come near by their mishpekhot, the mishpakhat Matri was lakhad (singled out [by lot]) , and Sha'ul Ben Kish was lakhad; and when they searched for him, he could not be found."
Shmuel Alef,10,22,"Therefore they inquired of Hashem further, Has the ish come here yet? And Hashem answered, Hinei he hath hid himself among the kelim (vessels, baggage, stuff)."
Shmuel Alef,10,23,"And they ran and brought him out from there; and when he stood among HaAm, he was taller than any of HaAm from his shekhamim (shoulders) upward."
Shmuel Alef,10,24,"And Shmuel said to kol HaAm, See ye him whom Hashem hath chosen? That there is none like him among kol HaAm? And kol HaAm shouted, and said, May HaMelech live!"
Shmuel Alef,10,25,"Then Shmuel told HaAm the mishpat haMelukhah (right of the monarchy) , and wrote it in a sefer, and deposited it up before Hashem . And Shmuel sent kol HaAm away, every ish to his bais."
Shmuel Alef,10,26,And Sha'ul also went home to Giv'ah; and there went with him the valiant whose lev Elohim had touched.
Shmuel Alef,10,27,"But the Bnei Beliyaal said, How shall this one yoshi'einu (save us) ? And they despised him, and brought no minchah (gift) . But he held his peace."
Shmuel Alef,11,1,"Then Nachash the Ammoni came up, and laid siege to Yavesh Gil'ad; and all the anashim of Yavesh said unto Nachash, Make a brit with us, and we will serve thee."
Shmuel Alef,11,2,"And Nachash the Ammoni answered them, On this condition will I cut a brit with you, that I may gouge out all your ayin yamin (right eyes) , and so bring cherpah upon kol Yisroel."
Shmuel Alef,11,3,"And the Zekenim of Yavesh said unto him, Give us shivat yamim that we may send malachim unto all the territory of Yisroel; and then, if there be no moshi'a to save us, we will come out and surrender to thee."
Shmuel Alef,11,4,"Then came the malachim to Giv'at Sha'ul, and told the devarim in the oznayim of HaAm; and kol HaAm lifted up their kol (voices) , and wept."
Shmuel Alef,11,5,"And, hinei, Sha'ul came after the bakar out of the sadeh; and Sha'ul said, What aileth HaAm that they weep? And they told him the divrei anshei Yavesh."
Shmuel Alef,11,6,"And the Ruach Elohim came upon Sha'ul when he heard those devarim, and his anger was kindled greatly."
Shmuel Alef,11,7,"And he took a tzemed bakar, and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the territory of Yisroel by the hands of malachim, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Sha'ul and after Shmuel, so shall it be done unto his bakar. And the pachad Hashem fell on HaAm, and they came out as ish echad."
Shmuel Alef,11,8,"And when he mustered them at Bezek, the Bnei Yisroel were three hundred elef, and the Ish Yehudah thirty elef."
Shmuel Alef,11,9,"And they said unto the malachim that came, Thus shall ye say unto the Ish Yavesh Gil'ad, Tomorrow, by the time the shemesh is hot, teshuah will come to you. So the malachim came and reported it to the anshei Yavesh; and they had simchah."
Shmuel Alef,11,10,"Therefore the anshei Yavesh said, Tomorrow we will come out to surrender unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth tov in your eyes."
Shmuel Alef,11,11,"And it was so on the next day, that Sha'ul set HaAm into shloshah rashim (three companies) ; and they came into the midst of the machaneh in the ashmoret haboker (morning watch) , and slaughtered Ammon until the chom (heat) of the yom; and it came to pass, that they which survived were scattered, so that no two of them were left together."
Shmuel Alef,11,12,"HaAm said unto Shmuel, Who is he that said, Shall Sha'ul reign as melech over us? Bring the anashim, that we may put them to death."
Shmuel Alef,11,13,"And Sha'ul said, There shall not an ish be put to death this day; for today Hashem hath wrought Teshuah (Salvation) in Yisroel."
Shmuel Alef,11,14,"Then said Shmuel to HaAm, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the Meluchah (kingdom) there."
Shmuel Alef,11,15,And kol HaAm went to Gilgal; and there they made Sha'ul Melech before Hashem in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed zevakhim of shelamim before Hashem ; and there Sha'ul and kol Anshei Yisroel rejoiced with simchah me'od.
Shmuel Alef,12,1,"And Shmuel said unto kol Yisroel, Hinei, I have paid heed unto your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have set a Melech over you."
Shmuel Alef,12,2,"And now, hinei, the Melech walketh before you; and I am old and grayheaded; and, hinei, my banim are with you; and I have walked before you from my youth unto hayom hazeh."
Shmuel Alef,12,3,"Hineni (here I am) ; testify against me before Hashem , and before His Moshiach. Whose shor (ox) have I taken? Or whose chamor (donkey) have I taken? Or whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed? Or from whose yad have I accepted any kofer to blind mine eyes therewith? And I will restitution make to you."
Shmuel Alef,12,4,"And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken anything from any yad ish."
Shmuel Alef,12,5,"And he said unto them, Ed Hashem( Hashem is witness) against you, and His Moshiach is ed (witness) this day, that ye have not found anything in my yad. And they answered, He is Ed (witness)."
Shmuel Alef,12,6,"And Shmuel said unto HaAm, It is Hashem that made Moshe and Aharon, and that brought avoteichem up out of Eretz Mitzrayim."
Shmuel Alef,12,7,"Now therefore stand still, that I may enter into shofet judgment with you before Hashem of kol tzidkot (all the righteous acts ), which He made for you and avoteichem."
Shmuel Alef,12,8,"When Ya'akov was come into Mitzrayim, and avoteichem cried unto Hashem , then Hashem sent Moshe and Aharon, which brought forth avoteichem out of Mitzrayim, and made them dwell in this makom (place)."
Shmuel Alef,12,9,"And when they forgot Hashem Eloheihem, He sold them into the yad Sisra, Sar Tzeva Chatzor, and into the yad Pelishtim, and into the yad Melech Moav, and they fought against them."
Shmuel Alef,12,10,"And they cried unto Hashem , and said, Chatanu (we have sinned) , because we have forsaken Hashem , and have served Ba'alim and Ashtarot; but now deliver us out of the yad oyeveinu (power, hand of our enemies) , and we will serve Thee."
Shmuel Alef,12,11,"And Hashem sent Yeruba'al, and Bedan, and Yiftach, and Shmuel, and delivered you out of the yad oyeveichem on every side, and ye dwelled betach (in safety)."
Shmuel Alef,12,12,"And when ye saw that Nachash Melech Bnei Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, No; but a Melech shall reign over us: when Hashem Eloheichem was your Melech."
Shmuel Alef,12,13,"Now therefore behold the Melech whom ye have chosen, and for whom ye have made request! And, hinei, Hashem hath set a Melech over you."
Shmuel Alef,12,14,"If ye will fear Hashem , and serve Him, and obey His voice, and not rebel against the commandment of Hashem , then shall both ye and also the Melech that reigneth over you continue following after Hashem Eloheichem;"
Shmuel Alef,12,15,"But if ye will not obey the voice of Hashem , but rebel against the commandment of Hashem , then shall the yad Hashem be against you, as it was against avoteichem."
Shmuel Alef,12,16,"Now therefore stand and see this davar hagadol (great thing) , which Hashem will make before your eyes."
Shmuel Alef,12,17,"Is it not ketzir chittim (wheat harvest) today? I will call unto Hashem , and He shall send kolot (thunder) and matar (rain) ; that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness is rabbah (great) , which ye have made in the eyes of Hashem , in requesting for you a Melech."
Shmuel Alef,12,18,So Shmuel called unto Hashem ; and Hashem sent kolot and matar that day; and kol HaAm greatly feared Hashem and Shmuel.
Shmuel Alef,12,19,"And kol HaAm said unto Shmuel, Pray for thy avadim unto Hashem Eloheicha, that we die not; for we have added unto kol chattoteinu (all our sins) this ra'ah (evil) , to ask for us a Melech."
Shmuel Alef,12,20,"And Shmuel said unto HaAm, Fear not; ye have done kol hara'ah hazot (all this wickedness) ; yet turn not aside from following Hashem , but serve Hashem with kol levavchem;"
Shmuel Alef,12,21,"And turn ye not aside; for then should ye go after hatohu (the vain, empty thing, idol) , which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are tohu (vain, empty)."
Shmuel Alef,12,22,For Hashem will not forsake His people for the sake of Shmo Hagedol; because it hath pleased Hashem to make you His people.
Shmuel Alef,12,23,"Moreover, as for me, chalilah (far be it) from me that I should sin against Hashem in ceasing to pray for you; but horeiti (I will teach) you the derech hatovah v'hayesharah (the good and upright way);"
Shmuel Alef,12,24,"Only fear Hashem , and serve Him in emes with kol levavchem; for consider what great things He hath done for you."
Shmuel Alef,12,25,"But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your Melech."
Shmuel Alef,13,1,"It was in the first year of Sha'ul ºs reign, and when he had reigned two shanim over Yisroel,"
Shmuel Alef,13,2,"Sha'ul chose him shloshet alafim of Yisroel; whereof two elef were with Sha'ul at Michmas and in har Beit-El, and an elef were with Yonatan in Giv'at Binyamin; and the rest of HaAm he sent back every ish to his ohel."
Shmuel Alef,13,3,"And Yonatan struck the outpost of the Pelishtim (Philistines) that was in Geva, and the Pelishtim heard of it. Then Sha'ul blew the shofar throughout kol HaAretz, saying, Let the Ivrim (Hebrews) hear."
Shmuel Alef,13,4,"And kol Yisroel heard the news that Sha'ul had struck the outpost of the Pelishtim (Philistines) , and that Yisroel also had become odious to the Pelishtim. And HaAm were called together after Sha'ul at Gilgal."
Shmuel Alef,13,5,"And the Pelishtim (Philistines) gathered themselves together to fight against Yisroel, sheloshim elef merkavot and sheshet alafim parashim, and soldiers like the chol (sand) which is on the seashore in multitude; and they came up, and encamped at Michmas, east of Beit-Aven."
Shmuel Alef,13,6,"When the Ish Yisroel saw that they were in danger (for the army was hard-pressed) , then the people did hide themselves in me'arot (caves) , and in thickets, and among rocks, and in towers, and in borot (pits)."
Shmuel Alef,13,7,"And some of the Ivrim (Hebrews) went over Yarden to Eretz Gad and Gil'ad. As for Sha'ul, he was yet in Gilgal, and kol HaAm followed him fearfully trembling."
Shmuel Alef,13,8,"And he tarried shivat yamim, according to the mo'ed (set time) that Shmuel had appointed; but Shmuel came not to Gilgal; and HaAm started slipping away from him."
Shmuel Alef,13,9,"And Sha'ul said, Bring to me the olah (burnt offering) , and shelamim (peace offerings) . And he offered the olah (burnt offering)."
Shmuel Alef,13,10,"And it came to pass, that as soon as he had finished offering the olah (burnt offering) , hinei, Shmuel came; and Sha'ul went out to meet him, that he might make a brocha greeting on him."
Shmuel Alef,13,11,"And Shmuel said, What hast thou done? And Sha'ul said, Because I saw that HaAm were slipping away from me, and that thou camest not at the mo'ed hayamim, and that the Pelishtim were assembling themselves together at Michmas;"
Shmuel Alef,13,12,"Therefore, said I, the Pelishtim (Philistines) will come down now upon me at Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto Hashem ; I felt compelled therefore, and offered the olah (burnt offering)."
Shmuel Alef,13,13,"And Shmuel said to Sha'ul, Thou hast done foolishly; thou hast not been shomer over the mitzvat Hashem Eloheicha, which He commanded thee; for now would Hashem have established thy mamlachah over Yisroel ad olam."
Shmuel Alef,13,14,"But now thy mamlachah shall not endure; Hashem hath sought for Him an ish after His own levav, and Hashem hath commanded him to be Nagid over His people, because thou hast not been shomer over that which Hashem commanded thee."
Shmuel Alef,13,15,"And Shmuel arose, and went up from Gilgal unto Giv'at Binyamin. And Sha'ul numbered HaAm that were being found with him, about shesh me'ot ish (six hundred men)."
Shmuel Alef,13,16,"And Sha'ul, and Yonatan bno, and HaAm that were being found with them, abode in Geva of Binyamin; but the Pelishtim encamped in Michmas."
Shmuel Alef,13,17,"And the raiders came out of the machaneh of the Pelishtim in three companies; one company turned toward the derech Ophrah, unto Eretz Shu'al;"
Shmuel Alef,13,18,And another company turned toward derech Beit-Choron; and another company turned toward derech (the road) of the border that overlooks Gey HaTzevo'im toward the midbar.
Shmuel Alef,13,19,"Now there was no charash (blacksmith) found throughout kol Eretz Yisroel; for the Pelishtim (Philistines) said, Lest the Ivrim (Hebrews) make them cherev (sword) or khanit (spear);"
Shmuel Alef,13,20,"But kol Yisroel went down to the Pelishtim, to sharpen every ish his plowshare, and his spade, and his axe, and his hoe."
Shmuel Alef,13,21,"And a dullness of the edges occurred in the plowshares, hoes, three pronged pitchforks, axes, and for repointing the darvon (goad)."
Shmuel Alef,13,22,"So it came to pass in the yom milchemet (day of battle) , that there was neither cherev nor khanit found in the yad kol HaAm that were with Sha'ul and Yonatan; but with Sha'ul and with Yonatan bno was there found."
Shmuel Alef,13,23,And the detachment of the Pelishtim (Philistines) went out toward Ma'avar Michmas (Michmas Pass).
Shmuel Alef,14,1,"Now the day came to pass, that Yonatan Ben Sha'ul said unto the na'ar (young man) that bore his armor, Come, and let us go over to the outpost of the Pelishtim (Philistines) , that is on the other side.But he told not aviv."
Shmuel Alef,14,2,"And Sha'ul tarried in the outskirts of Giv'ah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron; and HaAm (the people, the army) that were with him were about shesh me'ot ish (six hundred men);"
Shmuel Alef,14,3,"And Achiyah Ben Achituv, the ach of Ikhavod Ben Pinchas Ben Eli, kohen Hashem in Shiloh, was wearing an ephod. And HaAm knew not that Yonatan was gone."
Shmuel Alef,14,4,"And between the passes, by which Yonatan sought to go over unto the outpost of the Pelishtim, there was a rocky cliff on the one side, and a rocky cliff on the other side; and the shem of the one was Botzetz, and the shem of the other Seneh."
Shmuel Alef,14,5,"The one steep rock faced north opposite Michmas, and the other southward toward Geva."
Shmuel Alef,14,6,"And Yonatan said to the na'ar that bore his armor, Come, and let us go over unto the outpost of these arelim (uncircumcised) ; it may be that Hashem will act for us; for nothing restrains Hashem l'hoshi'a (to save) , by many or by few."
Shmuel Alef,14,7,"And his armor-bearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine lev; turn thee; hineni, I am with thee according to thy lev."
Shmuel Alef,14,8,"Then said Yonatan, Hinei, we will pass over unto these anashim, and we will show ourselves unto them."
Shmuel Alef,14,9,"If they say thus unto us, Stand still until we come to you; then we will stand still tachteinu (in our place) , and will not go up unto them."
Shmuel Alef,14,10,"But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up; for Hashem hath delivered them into yadenu (our hand, power) : and this shall be haot (the sign) unto us."
Shmuel Alef,14,11,"And both of them showed themselves unto the outpost of the Pelishtim (Philistines) ; and the Pelishtim said, Hinei, the Ivrim (Hebrews) come forth out of the chorim (holes) where they had hid themselves."
Shmuel Alef,14,12,"And the anashim of the outpost answered Yonatan and his armor-bearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will teach you a thing. And Yonatan said unto his armor-bearer, Come up after me, for Hashem hath delivered them into the yad Yisroel."
Shmuel Alef,14,13,"And Yonatan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armor-bearer after him; and they fell before Yonatan; and his armor-bearer slaughtered behind him."
Shmuel Alef,14,14,"And that first attack, which Yonatan and his armor-bearer made, killed about esrim ish (twenty men) , within an area of half a yoke."
Shmuel Alef,14,15,"And there was fearful panic in the machaneh, in the sadeh, and among kol haAm; the outpost, and the raiders, they also trembled, and ha'aretz quaked; so it was a cheredat Elohim (a panic from Elohim)."
Shmuel Alef,14,16,"And the tzofim (watchmen, lookouts, sentries) of Sha'ul in Giv'at Binyamin looked; and, hinei, the multitude melted away, and they went in all directions."
Shmuel Alef,14,17,"Then said Sha'ul unto HaAm that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, hinei, Yonatan and his armor-bearer were not there."
Shmuel Alef,14,18,"And Sha'ul said unto Achiyah, Bring here the Aron HaElohim. For the Aron HaElohim was at that time with the Bnei Yisroel there."
Shmuel Alef,14,19,"And it came to pass, while Sha'ul talked to the kohen, that the tumult that was in the machaneh Pelishtim went on and increased; and Sha'ul said unto the kohen, Withdraw thine yad."
Shmuel Alef,14,20,"And Sha'ul and kol HaAm that were with him assembled themselves, and they went to the milchamah; and, hinei, every cherev ish was against his fellow, and there was mehumah gedolah me'od (a very great confusion)."
Shmuel Alef,14,21,"Moreover the Ivrim (Hebrews) that were with the Pelishtim (Philistines) before that time, which went up with them into the machaneh from the country round about, even they also turned to be with them of Yisroel that were with Sha'ul and Yonatan."
Shmuel Alef,14,22,"Likewise all the Ish Yisroel which had hid themselves in Har Ephrayim, when they heard that the Pelishtim fled, even they also followed hard after them in the milchamah (battle)."
Shmuel Alef,14,23,So Hashem saved Yisroel that day; and the milchamah continued raging even unto Beit-Aven.
Shmuel Alef,14,24,"And the Ish Yisroel were distressed that day; for Sha'ul had bound under oath HaAm, saying, Arur (cursed) be the ish that eateth lechem before erev, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of HaAm tasted lechem."
Shmuel Alef,14,25,And all they of HaAretz came to the wood; and there was devash on the surface of the sadeh.
Shmuel Alef,14,26,"And when HaAm were come into the wood, hinei, the devash was oozing; but no one put his yad to his mouth; for HaAm feared the shevuah (oath)."
Shmuel Alef,14,27,"But Yonatan heard not when aviv bound HaAm with the oath; wherefore he put forth the end of the matteh (staff) that was in his yad, and dipped it in a honeycomb of the devash, and put his yad to his mouth; and his eyes brightened."
Shmuel Alef,14,28,"Then answered an ish from HaAm, and said, Avicha strictly bound HaAm with an oath, saying, Arur (cursed) be the ish that eateth lechem this day. And HaAm were faint with famished exhaustion."
Shmuel Alef,14,29,"Then said Yonatan, Avi hath troubled HaAretz; see, now, how mine eyes hath brightened, because I tasted a little of this devash."
Shmuel Alef,14,30,"How much more, if only HaAm had eaten freely today of the plunder of their enemies which they found? For would there not have been now a much greater makkah (slaughter) among the Pelishtim (Philistines)?"
Shmuel Alef,14,31,And they drove back the Pelishtim that day from Michmas to Ayalon; and HaAm were very faint.
Shmuel Alef,14,32,"And the people flew upon the plunder, and took tzon, and bakar, and calves and butchered them on the ground; and HaAm did eat them with the dahm."
Shmuel Alef,14,33,"Then they told Sha'ul, saying, Hinei, HaAm sin against Hashem , in that they eat with the dahm. And he said, Ye have dealt treacherously; today roll an even gedolah (large stone) over here to me."
Shmuel Alef,14,34,"Then Sha'ul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me here every ish his shor (ox) , and every ish his seh, and you make shochet slaughter of them here, and eat; and sin not against Hashem in eating with the dahm. And kol HaAm brought every ish his shor with him that lailah, and made shochet slaughter of them there."
Shmuel Alef,14,35,And Sha'ul built a Mizbe'ach unto Hashem ; it was the first time that he built a Mizbe'ach unto Hashem.
Shmuel Alef,14,36,"And Sha'ul said, Let us go down after the Pelishtim by lailah, and plunder them until the ohr haboker, and let us not leave an ish of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth tov in thine eyes. Then said the kohen, Let us draw near here unto HaElohim."
Shmuel Alef,14,37,"And Sha'ul asked counsel of Elohim, Shall I go down after the Pelishtim? Wilt Thou deliver them into the yad Yisroel? But He did not answer him on that day."
Shmuel Alef,14,38,"And Sha'ul said, Draw ye near here, all the pinnot (corners, chiefs of) HaAm; and know and see wherein this chattat hath been this day."
Shmuel Alef,14,39,"For, as Hashem the Moshia Yisroel liveth, though it be in Yonatan beni (my son) , he shall surely die. But there was none among kol HaAm that answered him."
Shmuel Alef,14,40,"Then said he unto kol Yisroel, Be ye on one side, and I and Yonatan beni will be on the other side. And HaAm said unto Sha'ul, Do what seemeth tov in thine eyes."
Shmuel Alef,14,41,"Therefore Sha'ul said unto Hashem Elohei Yisroel, Give a tamim (perfect lot) . And Sha'ul and Yonatan were taken by lot; but HaAm escaped [from being taken by lot]."
Shmuel Alef,14,42,"And Sha'ul said, Cast lots between me and Yonatan beni (my son) . And Yonatan was taken by lot."
Shmuel Alef,14,43,"Then Sha'ul said to Yonatan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Yonatan told him, and said, I did but taste a little devash with the end of the matteh that was in mine yad, and, hineni, I must die."
Shmuel Alef,14,44,"And Sha'ul answered, Elohim do so and more also if thou shalt not surely die, Yonatan."
Shmuel Alef,14,45,"And HaAm said unto Sha'ul, Shall Yonatan die, who hath wrought this Yeshu'ah HaGedolah (Great Salvation, Deliverance, Rescue) in Yisroel? Chalilah (far be it!) ; as Hashem liveth, there shall not one hair of his rosh fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with Elohim this day. So HaAm rescued Yonatan, that he died not."
Shmuel Alef,14,46,Then Sha'ul stopped following the Pelishtim; and the Pelishtim withdrew to their own makom.
Shmuel Alef,14,47,"So Sha'ul took the melachah (kingdom, establishment of sovereignty) over Yisroel, and fought against all his oyevim on every side, against Moav, and against the Bnei Ammon, and against Edom, and against the melachim of Tzovah, and against the Pelishtim; and everywhere he turned himself, he terrorized them."
Shmuel Alef,14,48,"And he gathered an army, and struck Amalek, and delivered Yisroel out of the hands of them that plundered them."
Shmuel Alef,14,49,"Now the Bnei Sha'ul were Yonatan, and Yishvi, and Malki-Shu'a; and the shmot of his two banot were these; the shem of the bechirah (first born [daughter]) , Merav, and the shem of the younger Michal;"
Shmuel Alef,14,50,And the shem of eshet Sha'ul was Achino'am Bat Achima'atz; and the shem of the Sar of his Tzeva was Avner Ben Ner and Ner was dod Sha'ul (uncle of Sha'ul).
Shmuel Alef,14,51,And Kish was Avi Sha'ul; Ner Avi Avner was ben Aviel.
Shmuel Alef,14,52,"And there was milchamah chazakah against the Pelishtim all the days of Sha'ul; and when Sha'ul saw any ish gibbor, or any valiant man, he recruited him."
Shmuel Alef,15,1,"Shmuel also said unto Sha'ul, Hashem sent me limeshachacha (to anoint thee) to be Melech over His people, over Yisroel; now therefore shema (pay heed) thou unto the voice of the Divrei Hashem."
Shmuel Alef,15,2,"Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os, I remember that which Amalek did to Yisroel, how he waylaid him on the derech, when he came up from Mitzrayim."
Shmuel Alef,15,3,"Now go and attack Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both ish and isha, olel, and yonek, shor, seh, gamal, and chamor."
Shmuel Alef,15,4,"And Sha'ul gathered HaAm together, and numbered them at Tela'im, two hundred elef foot soldiers, and ten elef Ish Yehudah."
Shmuel Alef,15,5,"And Sha'ul came to a city of Amalek, and lay in wait in the valley."
Shmuel Alef,15,6,"And Sha'ul said unto the Keni, Go, depart, get you away from among the Amaleki, lest I destroy you with them; for ye showed chesed to kol Bnei Yisroel, when they came up out of Mitzrayim. So the Keni moved away from among Amalek."
Shmuel Alef,15,7,"And Sha'ul attacked Amalek from Chavilah until where thou comest to Shur, that is alongside Mitzrayim."
Shmuel Alef,15,8,"And he took Agag Melech Amalek alive, and destroyed with utter cherem destruction kol haAm with the edge of the cherev."
Shmuel Alef,15,9,"But Sha'ul and HaAm spared Agag, and the best of the tzon, and of the bakar, and of the fat bulls, and the fat sheep, and all that was tov, and would not utterly destroy them; but everything that was despised and worthless, that they destroyed with utter cherem destruction."
Shmuel Alef,15,10,"Then came the Devar Hashem unto Shmuel, saying,"
Shmuel Alef,15,11,"I greatly regret and relent and reconsider that I have set up Sha'ul to be Melech; for he is turned back from following Me, and hath not performed My Devar. And it grieved Shmuel; and he cried out unto Hashem kol halailah."
Shmuel Alef,15,12,"And when Shmuel rose early to meet Sha'ul in the boker, it was told Shmuel, saying, Sha'ul came to Carmel, and, hinei, he set up a yad (hand, i.e. memorial, monument) for himself. And he turned and went down to Gilgal."
Shmuel Alef,15,13,"And Shmuel came to Sha'ul; and Sha'ul said unto him, Baruch atah l' Hashem ; I have carried out the Devar Hashem."
Shmuel Alef,15,14,"And Shmuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the tzon (sheep) in mine ears, and the lowing of the bakar (cattle) which I hear?"
Shmuel Alef,15,15,"And Sha'ul said, They have brought them from Amalek; for HaAm spared the best of the tzon and of the bakar, in order to sacrifice unto Hashem Eloheicha; and the rest we have destroyed in utter cherem desruction."
Shmuel Alef,15,16,"Then Shmuel said unto Sha'ul, Stop, and I will tell thee what Hashem hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on."
Shmuel Alef,15,17,"And Shmuel said, When thou wast katon (little) in thine own eyes, wast thou not made the Rosh Shivtei Yisroel, and Hashem anointed thee Melech over Yisroel?"
Shmuel Alef,15,18,"And Hashem sent thee baderech (on a mission) , and said, Go destroy with utter cherem destruction the chatta'im (sinners) , Amalek, and make war against them until they be consumed."
Shmuel Alef,15,19,"Why then didst thou not obey the voice of Hashem , but didst pounce upon the plunder, and didst harah (the evil) in the eyes of Hashem?"
Shmuel Alef,15,20,"And Sha'ul said unto Shmuel, Yes, I have obeyed the voice of Hashem , and have gone baderech (on the mission) which Hashem sent me, and have brought back Agag Melech Amalek, and have destroyed Amalek with utter cherem destruction."
Shmuel Alef,15,21,"But HaAm took of the plunder the tzon and bakar, the reshit of the cherem to sacrifice unto Hashem Eloheicha at Gilgal."
Shmuel Alef,15,22,"And Shmuel said, Hath Hashem as great chefetz (delight) in olot and zevakhim, as in obeying the voice of Hashem ? Hinei, to obey is better than zevach (sacrifice) , and to pay heed than the chelev eilim (fat of rams)."
Shmuel Alef,15,23,"For meri (rebellion) is as the chattat (sin) of kesem (witchcraft, soothsaying, divination) , and stubbornness is as heathenish iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the Devar Hashem , He hath also rejected thee from being Melech."
Shmuel Alef,15,24,"And Sha'ul said unto Shmuel, Chatati (I have sinned) : for I have transgressed the commandment of Hashem , and thy words: because I feared HaAm, and listened to their voice."
Shmuel Alef,15,25,"Therefore, now, pardon my sin, and turn back with me, that I may worship Hashem."
Shmuel Alef,15,26,"And Shmuel said unto Sha'ul, I will not go back with thee: for thou hast rejected the Davar Hashem , and Hashem hath rejected thee from being Melech over Yisroel."
Shmuel Alef,15,27,"And as Shmuel turned about to go away, he seized the edge of his me'il (robe, mantle) , and he tore (it)."
Shmuel Alef,15,28,"And Shmuel said unto him, Hashem hath torn the Mamlechut Yisroel from thee this day, and hath given it to a re'a (neighbor) of thine, that is better than thou."
Shmuel Alef,15,29,"And also the Netzach Yisroel (Eternal One of Israel) will not lie nor relent: for He is not an adam, that He should change His mind."
Shmuel Alef,15,30,"Then he said, Chatati (I have sinned) : yet honor me now, before the Ziknei Ami, and before Yisroel, and turn back with me, that I may worship Hashem Eloheicha."
Shmuel Alef,15,31,So Shmuel turned back after Sha'ul; and Sha'ul worshiped Hashem.
Shmuel Alef,15,32,"Then said Shmuel, Bring ye to me Agag Melech Amalek. And Agag came unto him confidently. And Agag thought, Surely the mar hamavet (bitterness of death) is past."
Shmuel Alef,15,33,"And Shmuel said, As thy cherev hath made nashim childless, so shall immecha be childless among nashim. And Shmuel cut Agag in pieces before Hashem at Gilgal."
Shmuel Alef,15,34,Then Shmuel went to Ramah; and Sha'ul went up to his bais at Giv'at Sha'ul.
Shmuel Alef,15,35,Until his yom mot Shmuel came not again to see him: nevertheless Shmuel mourned for Sha'ul: and Hashem relented that He had made Sha'ul Melech over Yisroel.
Shmuel Alef,16,1,"And Hashem said unto Shmuel, Ad mosai wilt thou mourn for Sha'ul, seeing I have rejected him as Melech al Yisroel? Fill thine keren with shemen, and go, I will send thee to Yishai of Beit-Lechem: for I have provided Me a melech among his banim."
Shmuel Alef,16,2,"And Shmuel said, How can I go? If Sha'ul hear it, he will kill me. And Hashem said, Take an eglat bakar (heifer of the herd) with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to Hashem."
Shmuel Alef,16,3,"And call Yishai to the zevach, and I will show thee what thou shalt do; umashachta (and thou shalt anoint) unto Me him whom I say unto thee."
Shmuel Alef,16,4,"And Shmuel did that which Hashem spoke, and came to Beit-Lechem. And the zekenim of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou in shalom?"
Shmuel Alef,16,5,"And he said, Shalom; I am come to sacrifice unto Hashem ; set yourselves apart as kodesh, and come with me to the zevach. And he set apart as kodesh Yishai and his banim, and called them to the zevach."
Shmuel Alef,16,6,"And it came to pass, when they were come, that he took one look at Eliav, and said, Surely Hashem  ºs Moshiach is before Him."
Shmuel Alef,16,7,"But Hashem said unto Shmuel, Look not on his mareh (appearance) , or on the height of his stature; because I have rejected him; for Hashem seeth not as HaAdam seeth; for HaAdam looketh at the einayim (eyes, outward form); Hashem looketh at the lev."
Shmuel Alef,16,8,"Then Yishai called Avinadav, and made him pass before Shmuel. And he said, Neither hath Hashem chosen this."
Shmuel Alef,16,9,"Then Yishai made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath Hashem chosen this."
Shmuel Alef,16,10,"Again, Yishai made his shivat banim to pass before Shmuel. And Shmuel said unto Yishai, these Hashem hath not bachar (chosen)."
Shmuel Alef,16,11,"And Shmuel said unto Yishai, Are here all thy ne'arim (boys) ? And he said, There remaineth yet the katan (small, young) , and, hinei, ro'eh batzon (tending the flock) is he. And Shmuel said unto Yishai, Send and get him; for we will not sit down [to eat] till he come here."
Shmuel Alef,16,12,"And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was adomoni (ruddy, of healthy red complexion) and withal of a yafeh countenance, and good-looking. And Hashem said, Arise, meshachehu (anoint him) ; ki zeh hu (for this is he)."
Shmuel Alef,16,13,"Then Shmuel took the keren of shemen, v'yimshach (and anointed) him in the midst of his achim; and the Ruach of Hashem came upon Dovid from that day forward. So Shmuel rose up, and went to Ramah."
Shmuel Alef,16,14,"But the Ruach of Hashem departed from Sha'ul, and a ruach ra'ah from Hashem terrified and overwhelmed him."
Shmuel Alef,16,15,"And the avdei Sha'ul said unto him, Hinei now, a ruach Elohim ra'ah terrifieth and overwhelmeth thee."
Shmuel Alef,16,16,"Let adoneinu now command thy avadim, which are before thee, to seek out an ish, who is a menagen (player) on the kinnor (harp) ; and it shall come to pass, when the ruach Elohim ra'ah is upon thee, that he shall play with his yad, and thou shalt be tov (better, well)."
Shmuel Alef,16,17,"And Sha'ul said unto his avadim, Look for me now an ish that can play well, and bring him to me."
Shmuel Alef,16,18,"Then answered one of the ne'arim, and said, Hinei, I have seen a ben of Yishai of Beit-Lechem, that is skillful in playing, and a gibbor chayil and an ish milchamah prudent in matters, and an ish to'ar (handsome man) , and Hashem is with him."
Shmuel Alef,16,19,"Wherefore Sha'ul sent malachim unto Yishai, and said, Send me Dovid binecha, which is with the tzon."
Shmuel Alef,16,20,"And Yishai took a chamor laden with lechem, and a skin of yayin, and a gedi (young goat) , and sent them by Dovid bno unto Sha'ul."
Shmuel Alef,16,21,"And Dovid came to Sha'ul, and stood before him; and he loved him greatly; and he became his no'se kelim (armor-bearer)."
Shmuel Alef,16,22,"And Sha'ul sent to Yishai, saying, Let Dovid, now, stand before me; for he hath found chen (favor) in my eyes."
Shmuel Alef,16,23,"And it came to pass, when the ruach Elohim was upon Sha'ul, that Dovid took the kinnor, and played with his yad; so Sha'ul was relieved, and was tov, and the ruach hara'ah departed from him."
Shmuel Alef,17,1,"Now the Pelishtim gathered together their machanot (camps, military forces) , for milchamah and were gathered together at Sokhoh, which belongeth to Yehudah, and encamped between Sokhoh and Azekah, in Ephes Dammim."
Shmuel Alef,17,2,"And Sha'ul and the Ish Yisroel were gathered together, and encamped by the Emek (valley) of Elah, and drew up in battle array against the Pelishtim (Philistines)."
Shmuel Alef,17,3,"And the Pelishtim stood on the har on the one side, and Yisroel stood on the har on the other side; and there was a gey between them."
Shmuel Alef,17,4,"And there went out an Ish HaBenayim out of the machanot of the Pelishtim, shmo Golyat (Goliath) , of Gat, whose height was shesh cubits and a span."
Shmuel Alef,17,5,"And he had a kova (helmet) of nechoshet upon his rosh, and he was wearing a coat of mail armor; and the weight of the coat of armor was five thousand shekels of nechoshet."
Shmuel Alef,17,6,"And he had mitzchah (greaves, i.e., leg plate armor) of nechoshet upon his legs, and a kidron (javelin) of nechoshet [slung] between his shoulders."
Shmuel Alef,17,7,And the khetz (shaft) of his khanit (spear) was like a weaver ºs beam; and his spear ºs blade weighed six hundred barzel (iron) shekels; and the no'se tzinnah (great shield bearer) walked ahead of him.
Shmuel Alef,17,8,"And he stood and cried out unto the ma'arkhot Yisroel (ranks of Israel) , and said unto them, Why are ye come out to line up for milchamah? Am not I a Pelishti, and ye avadim of Sha'ul? Choose you an ish for you, and let him come down to me."
Shmuel Alef,17,9,"If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your avadim; but if I prevail over him, and kill him, then shall ye be to us for avadim, and serve us."
Shmuel Alef,17,10,"And the Pelishti said, I defy the maarkhot Yisroel this day; give me ish, that we may fight together."
Shmuel Alef,17,11,"When Sha'ul and kol Yisroel heard those divrei haPelishti, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid."
Shmuel Alef,17,12,"Now Dovid was the ben ish of that Ephrati from Beit-Lechem Yehudah, shmo Yishai; and he had shmoneh banim; and the ish was zaken in the days of Sha'ul, advanced in age among anashim."
Shmuel Alef,17,13,"And the shloshet Bnei Yishai hagedolim went and followed Sha'ul to the milchamah; and the shem of his three banim that went to the milchamah were Eliav the bechor, and mishneh unto him Avinadav, and hashelishi (the third) Shammah."
Shmuel Alef,17,14,And Dovid was the katan; and the shloshah hagedolim followed Sha'ul.
Shmuel Alef,17,15,But Dovid went and returned from Sha'ul to tend tzon aviv at Beit-Lechem.
Shmuel Alef,17,16,"And the Pelishti drew near morning and evening, and presented himself arba'im yom."
Shmuel Alef,17,17,"And Yishai said unto Dovid bno, Take now for thy achim an ephah of this roasted grain, and these ten lechem, and run to the machaneh of thy achim;"
Shmuel Alef,17,18,"And carry these ten charitzei hecholov (cuts of milk, hence cheeses) unto the sar of their elef (unit, thousand) , and look how thy achim fare for shalom, and take their arvut (pledge)."
Shmuel Alef,17,19,"Now Sha'ul, and they, and all the Ish Yisroel, were in the Emek (Valley) of Elah (Oak) , fighting with the Pelishtim (Philistines)."
Shmuel Alef,17,20,"And Dovid rose up early in the boker, and left the tzon with a shomer (watchman) , and loaded up, and embarked, as Yishai had commanded him; and he came to the camp, as the army was going forth to the fight and shouted for the milchamah (battle)."
Shmuel Alef,17,21,"For Yisroel and the Pelishtim took their positions, ma'arakhah (battle array) facing ma'arakhah."
Shmuel Alef,17,22,"And Dovid left his supplies in the yad of the shomer hakelim (supply master) , and ran into the ma'arakhah (battle line) , and came and gave shalom greeting to his achim."
Shmuel Alef,17,23,"And as he talked with them, hinei, there came up the Ish HaBenayim Golyat HaPelishti shmo, from Gat, out of the lines of the Pelishtim, and spoke according to these words; and Dovid heard them."
Shmuel Alef,17,24,"And all the Ish Yisroel, when they saw the ish, fled from before him, and were greatly afraid."
Shmuel Alef,17,25,"And the Ish Yisroel said, Have ye seen this ish that is come up? Surely to defy Yisroel is he come up; and it shall be, that the ish who killeth him, the melech will give ashires gadol and will give him bitto (his daughter) [in marriage], and bais aviv make khofshi b'Yisroel (free, tax-exempt in Israel)."
Shmuel Alef,17,26,"And Dovid spoke to the anashim that stood by him, saying, What shall be done for the ish that killeth this Pelishti, and taketh away the cherpah (reproach) from Yisroel? For who is this Pelishti hearel (uncircumcised Philistine) that he should defy the ma'arkhot Elohim Chayyim (arrayed battle forces of the living G-d)?"
Shmuel Alef,17,27,"And HaAm answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the ish that killeth him."
Shmuel Alef,17,28,"And Eliav achiv hagadol heard when he spoke unto the anashim; and af Eliav was kindled against Dovid, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? And with whom hast thou left those few tzon in the midbar? I know thy zadon (presumptuousness) , and the evil of thine levav; for thou art come down l'ma'an (in order that) thou mightest watch the milchamah."
Shmuel Alef,17,29,"And Dovid said, What have I done now? It was only a davar (word) [I said], wasn't it?"
Shmuel Alef,17,30,"And he turned from him toward another, and spoke after the same manner; and HaAm answered him again according to the davar harishon (the previous word)."
Shmuel Alef,17,31,"And when the devarim (words) were heard which Dovid spoke, they rehearsed them before Sha'ul: and he sent for him."
Shmuel Alef,17,32,"And Dovid said to Sha'ul, Let no lev adam fail because of him; thy eved will go and fight with this Pelishti."
Shmuel Alef,17,33,"And Sha'ul said to Dovid, Thou art not able to go against this Pelishti to fight with him: for thou art but a na'ar (boy) , and he an ish milchamah (man of war) from his youth."
Shmuel Alef,17,34,"And Dovid said unto Sha'ul, Thy eved is ro'eh (shepherd) of tzon of aviv, and there came the ari, and the dov, and carried off seh out of the eder (flock):"
Shmuel Alef,17,35,"And I went out after him, and struck him, and saved out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught hold by his zakan (beard) , and struck him, and killed him."
Shmuel Alef,17,36,"Thy eved slaughtered both the ari and the dov: and this Pelishti hearel (uncircumcised Philistine) shall be as one of them, seeing he hath charaf (taunted, defied, disgraced) the maarkhot Elohim Chayyim."
Shmuel Alef,17,37,"Dovid said moreover, Hashem that saved me out of the paw of the ari, and out of the paw of the dov, He will save me out of the yad of this Pelishti. And Sha'ul said unto Dovid, Go, and Hashem be with thee."
Shmuel Alef,17,38,"And Sha'ul dressed Dovid with his armor-clothes, put a kova of nechoshet upon his rosh; also he dressed him with a coat of mail armor."
Shmuel Alef,17,39,"And Dovid girded his cherev over his armor-clothes, and he tried to walk; for lo nissah (he had not tested, proved) it. And Dovid said unto Sha'ul, I cannot go with these; for lo nissti (I have not proved them) . And Dovid took them off him."
Shmuel Alef,17,40,"And he took his makel (stick, staff) in his yad, and chose him chamishah chalukei avanim (five smooth stones) out of the nachal (brook) , and put them in a keli haro'im (shepherd ºs bag) which he had, even in a wayfarer ºs bag; and his kela (slingshot) was in his yad; and he drew near to the Pelishti."
Shmuel Alef,17,41,"And the Pelishti came on and drew near unto Dovid; and the ish, the no'se hatzinnah, went ahead of him."
Shmuel Alef,17,42,"And when the Pelishti squinted and saw Dovid, he despised him: for he was but a na'ar (boy) , and admoni (ruddy) , and yafeh mareh (good-looking)."
Shmuel Alef,17,43,"And the Pelishti said unto Dovid, Am I a kelev (dog) , that thou comest to me with maklot (sticks) ? And the Pelishti cursed Dovid by his g-ds."
Shmuel Alef,17,44,"And the Pelishti said to Dovid, Come to me, and I will give thy basar unto the oph hashomayim, and to the behemat hasadeh."
Shmuel Alef,17,45,"Then said Dovid to the Pelishti, Thou comest against me with a cherev (sword) , and with a khanit (spear) , and with a kidon (javelin) ; but I come against thee b'Shem Hashem Tzva'os Elohei Ma'arkhot Yisroel, whom thou hast defied."
Shmuel Alef,17,46,"This day will Hashem hand thee over into mine yad; and I will strike thee down, and take thine rosh from thee; and I will give the peger machaneh Pelishtim this day unto the oph hashomayim, and to the chayyat ha'aretz; that kol ha'aretz may know that there is Elohim in Yisroel."
Shmuel Alef,17,47,"And kol hakahal hazeh shall know that Hashem yehoshi'a (saveth) not with cherev or khanit; for the milchamah is Hashem  ºs, and He will give you (plural) into yadenu (our hands)."
Shmuel Alef,17,48,"And it came to pass, when the Pelishti arose, and came, and drew nigh to meet Dovid, that Dovid hastened, and ran toward the ma'arakhah (battle line) to meet the Pelishti."
Shmuel Alef,17,49,"And Dovid put his yad in his keli (bag) , and took from there an even (stone) , and slung it, and struck the Pelishti in his metzach (forehead) , that the even (stone) sunk into his metzach; and he fell upon his face to the ground."
Shmuel Alef,17,50,"So Dovid prevailed chazak over the Pelishti with a sling and with an even (stone) , and struck down the Pelishti, and killed him; but there was no cherev in the yad Dovid."
Shmuel Alef,17,51,"Therefore Dovid ran, and stood over the Pelishti, and took hold of his cherev, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slaughtered him, v'yikhrat (and cut off) his rosh therewith. And when the Pelishtim saw their gibbor was dead, they fled."
Shmuel Alef,17,52,"And the Anshei Yisroel and of Yehudah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Pelishtim, until thou come to the gey (valley) , and to the Sha'arei Ekron. And the challei Pelishtim fell by the derech to Sha'arayim, even unto Gat, and unto Ekron."
Shmuel Alef,17,53,"And the Bnei Yisroel returned from chasing after the Pelishtim, and they plundered their machanot."
Shmuel Alef,17,54,"And Dovid took the rosh of the Pelishti, and brought it to Yerushalayim; but he put his kelim (weapons) in his ohel."
Shmuel Alef,17,55,"And when Sha'ul saw Dovid go forth to meet the Pelishti, he said unto Avner, the sar hatzavah, Avner, whose ben is this na'ar? And Avner said, As thy nefesh liveth, O Melech, I cannot tell."
Shmuel Alef,17,56,"And the Melech said, Inquire thou whose ben this elem (young man) is."
Shmuel Alef,17,57,"And as Dovid returned from the slaughter of the Pelishti, Avner took him, and brought him before Sha'ul with the rosh of the Pelishti in his yad."
Shmuel Alef,17,58,"And Sha'ul said to him, Whose ben art thou, na'ar? And Dovid answered, I am the ben avdecha Yishai of Beit-Lechem."
Shmuel Alef,18,1,"And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Sha'ul, that the nefesh Yonatan was kashur (tied together) with the nefesh Dovid, and Yonatan loved him as his own nefesh."
Shmuel Alef,18,2,"And Sha'ul drafted him that day, and would let him return no more to the bais aviv."
Shmuel Alef,18,3,"Then Yonatan and Dovid made a brit (covenant) , because he loved him as his own nefesh."
Shmuel Alef,18,4,"And Yonatan stripped himself of the me'il (robe) that was upon him, and gave it to Dovid, and his middah (war garments) , even to his cherev, and to his keshet, and to his khagor (belt)."
Shmuel Alef,18,5,"And Dovid went out whithersoever Sha'ul sent him, and prospered; and Sha'ul set him over the anshei hamilchamah, and he was accepted in the sight of kol HaAm, and also in the sight of the avdei Sha'ul."
Shmuel Alef,18,6,"And it came to pass as they came, when Dovid was returned from the slaughter of the Pelishti, that the nashim came out of all towns of Yisroel, singing and dancing, to meet Sha'ul HaMelech, with tambourines, with simchah, and with cymbals."
Shmuel Alef,18,7,"And the nashim answered one another as they played, and said, Sha'ul hath slain his alafim, and Dovid his revavot (myriads)."
Shmuel Alef,18,8,"And Sha'ul was very angry, and the saying was displeasing in his eyes and he said, They have ascribed unto Dovid revavot, and to me they have ascribed but alafim; and what can he have more but the maluchah (kingship)?"
Shmuel Alef,18,9,And there was jealous suspicion in the way Sha'ul eyed Dovid from that day forward.
Shmuel Alef,18,10,"And it came to pass on the next day, that the ruach Elohim ra'ah came upon Sha'ul, and he prophesied inside the bais; and Dovid made music with his yad, as at other times; and there was a khanit in the yad Sha'ul."
Shmuel Alef,18,11,"And Sha'ul hurled the khanit; for he said, I will pin Dovid even to the wall with it. And Dovid escaped his presence twice."
Shmuel Alef,18,12,"And Sha'ul was afraid of Dovid, because Hashem was with him, and was departed from Sha'ul."
Shmuel Alef,18,13,"Therefore Sha'ul removed him from him, and made him his sar elef; and he went out and came in before HaAm."
Shmuel Alef,18,14,And Dovid was maskil (successful) in kol drakhim of him; and Hashem was with him.
Shmuel Alef,18,15,"Wherefore when Sha'ul saw that he was maskil me'od, he was afraid of him."
Shmuel Alef,18,16,"But kol Yisroel and Yehudah loved Dovid, because he went out and came in before them."
Shmuel Alef,18,17,"And Sha'ul said to Dovid, Hinei bitti hagedolah Merav, her will I give thee as isha; only be thou ben chayil (valiant) for me, and fight Hashem  ºs milchamot. For Sha'ul said, Let not mine yad be upon him, but let the yad Pelishtim be upon him."
Shmuel Alef,18,18,"And Dovid said unto Sha'ul, Who am I? And what is my life, or the mishpakhat avi in Yisroel, that I should be Choson to HaMelech?"
Shmuel Alef,18,19,"But it came to pass at the time when Merav Bat Sha'ul should have been given to Dovid, that she was given as isha unto Adriel the Mecholati."
Shmuel Alef,18,20,"And Michal Bat Sha'ul loved Dovid; and they told Sha'ul, and the thing was yashar in eyes."
Shmuel Alef,18,21,"And Sha'ul said, I will give him her, that she may be a mokesh to him, and that the yad Pelishtim may be against him. Wherefore Sha'ul said to Dovid, Thou shalt this day become Choson to me by one of my two."
Shmuel Alef,18,22,"And Sha'ul commanded his avadim, saying, Commune with Dovid privately, and say, Hinei, HaMelech hath chafetz (delight) in thee, and all his avadim love thee; now therefore be Choson to HaMelech."
Shmuel Alef,18,23,"And the avadim of Sha'ul spoke those devarim in the ears of Dovid. And Dovid said, Seemeth it a light thing in your eyes to become Choson to HaMelech, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?"
Shmuel Alef,18,24,"And the avadim of Sha'ul told him, saying, According to these words spoke Dovid."
Shmuel Alef,18,25,"And Sha'ul said, Thus shall ye say to Dovid, HaMelech has chafetz (desire) for not any mohar (dowry, bride price) but a hundred arelot (foreskins) of the Pelishtim, to be avenged of the oyevei HaMelech. But Sha'ul schemed to make Dovid fall by the yad Pelishtim."
Shmuel Alef,18,26,"And when his avadim told Dovid these devarim, it pleased Dovid well to be Choson of HaMelech; and the yamim were not expired."
Shmuel Alef,18,27,"Wherefore Dovid arose and went, he and his anashim, and slaughtered of the Pelishtim (Philistines) two hundred ish; and Dovid brought their arelot, and they gave them in full count to HaMelech, that he might be the Choson of HaMelech. And Sha'ul gave him Michal bitto as isha."
Shmuel Alef,18,28,"And Sha'ul saw and knew that Hashem was with Dovid, and that Michal Bat Sha'ul loved him."
Shmuel Alef,18,29,And Sha'ul was yet the more afraid of Dovid; and Sha'ul became oyev to Dovid kol hayamim.
Shmuel Alef,18,30,"Then the sarim of the Pelishtim went forth [to fight]; and it came to pass, after they went forth, that Dovid prospered more than all the avadim (officers) of Sha'ul; so that shmo became esteemed as of good reputation. And Sha'ul spoke to Yonatan bno, and to all his avadim, that they should kill Dovid."
Shmuel Alef,19,1,But Yehonatan Ben Sha'ul liked Dovid me'od.
Shmuel Alef,19,2,"Yehonatan reported [this] to Dovid, saying, Sha'ul aviv seeketh to kill thee; now therefore be shomer in the boker, and abide baseter (in a secret place) and hide thyself;"
Shmuel Alef,19,3,"And I will go out and stand beside avi in the sadeh where thou art, and I will speak of thee with avi; and what I see, that I will tell thee."
Shmuel Alef,19,4,"And Yehonatan spoke tov of Dovid unto Sha'ul aviv, and said unto him, Let not HaMelech commit chet against his eved, against Dovid; because he hath not committed chet against thee, and because his ma'asim have been toward thee tov me'od:"
Shmuel Alef,19,5,"For he did put his nefesh in his yad, and slaughtered the Pelishti (Philistine) , and Hashem wrought Teshuah Gedolah for kol Yisroel; thou sawest it, and didst rejoice with simcha. Why then wilt thou commit chet against dahm naki (innocent blood) , to slay Dovid chinom (without cause)?"
Shmuel Alef,19,6,"And Sha'ul paid heed unto the voice of Yehonatan; and Sha'ul swore a shevuah, As Hashem liveth, he shall not be slain."
Shmuel Alef,19,7,"And Yehonatan called Dovid, and Yehonatan reported to him all these devarim. And Yehonatan brought Dovid to Sha'ul, and he was in his presence, as in times past."
Shmuel Alef,19,8,"And there was milchamah again; and Dovid went out, and fought with the Pelishtim (Philistines) , and slaughtered them with a makkah gedolah (with a great blow) ; and they fled from him."
Shmuel Alef,19,9,"And there was a ruach Hashem ra'ah upon Sha'ul, as he sat in his Bais with his khanit (spear) in his yad; while Dovid menaggen (was playing music) with his yad."
Shmuel Alef,19,10,"And Sha'ul sought to pin Dovid to the wall with the khanit; but he slipped away out of Sha'ul ºs presence, and he drove the khanit into the wall; and Dovid fled, and escaped that lailah."
Shmuel Alef,19,11,"Sha'ul also sent malachim unto Bais Dovid, to put him under surveillance, and to slay him in the boker; and Michal his isha warned Dovid, saying, If thou not escape with thy nefesh halilah (tonight) , makhar (tomorrow) thou shalt be slain."
Shmuel Alef,19,12,"So Michal let Dovid down through the chalon; and he went, and fled, and escaped."
Shmuel Alef,19,13,"And Michal took the terafim, and laid it in the mittah, and put a piece of woven goat ºs hair at its head, and covered it with beged (cloth, garment)."
Shmuel Alef,19,14,"And when Sha'ul sent malachim to capture Dovid, she said, He is choleh (ill)."
Shmuel Alef,19,15,"And Sha'ul sent the malachim back to see Dovid, saying [to them], Bring him up to me in the mittah (bed) , to have him slain."
Shmuel Alef,19,16,"And when the malachim were come in, hinei, there was the terafim in the mittah, with a piece of woven goats º hair at its head."
Shmuel Alef,19,17,"And Sha'ul said unto Michal, Why hast thou so deceived me, and sent away mine oyev, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Sha'ul, He said unto me, Let me get away; why should I kill thee?"
Shmuel Alef,19,18,"So Dovid fled, and escaped, and came to Shmuel at Ramah, and told him all that Sha'ul had done to him. And he and Shmuel went and dwelt in the dwellings of the nevi'im."
Shmuel Alef,19,19,"And it was told Sha'ul, saying, Hinei, Dovid is at the dwellings of the nevi'im in Ramah."
Shmuel Alef,19,20,"And Sha'ul sent malachim to capture Dovid; and when they saw the kat (sect, group) of the nevi'im prophesying, and Shmuel standing as nitzav (overseeing) them, the Ruach Elohim was upon the malachim of Sha'ul, and they also prophesied."
Shmuel Alef,19,21,"And when it was told Sha'ul, he sent other malachim, and they prophesied likewise. And Sha'ul sent malachim again shelishim (third ones) and they prophesied also."
Shmuel Alef,19,22,"Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a bor hagadol (great pit) at Sekhu; and he asked and said, Where are Shmuel and Dovid? And one said, Hinei, they are at the dwellings of the nevi'im in Ramah."
Shmuel Alef,19,23,"And he went there to the dwellings of the nevi'im at Ramah; and the Ruach Elohim was upon him also, and he walked along prophesying, until he came to the dwellings of the nevi'im at Ramah."
Shmuel Alef,19,24,"And he stripped off his beged also, and prophesied before Shmuel in like manner, and lay down arom (naked) all that day and all that lailah. Thus they say, Is Sha'ul also among the nevi'im?"
Shmuel Alef,20,1,"And Dovid fled from Nayot in Ramah, and came and said before Yonatan, What have I done? What is mine avon? And what is my chattat before avicha, that he seeketh my nefesh?"
Shmuel Alef,20,2,"And he said unto him, Chalilah (may it never be!) ; thou shalt not die: hinei, avi will do nothing either gadol or katon, but that he will reveal it to me; and why should avi hide this thing from me? It is not so."
Shmuel Alef,20,3,"And Dovid took an oath, moreover, and said, Avicha certainly knoweth that I have found chen in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Yonatan know this, lest he be grieved; but truly as Hashem liveth, and as thy nefesh liveth, there is hardly a peysah (step) between me and mavet."
Shmuel Alef,20,4,"Then said Yonatan unto Dovid, Whatsoever thy nefesh saith, I will even do it for thee."
Shmuel Alef,20,5,"And Dovid said unto Yonatan, Hinei, makhar (tomorrow) is Rosh Chodesh, and I should not fail to sit with HaMelech for tish; but let me go, that I may hide myself in the sadeh unto the erev hashlishit."
Shmuel Alef,20,6,"If avicha at all miss me, then say, Dovid earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Beit-Lechem his town; for there is a zevach hayamim there for kol mishpakhat."
Shmuel Alef,20,7,"If he say thus, It is tov; thy eved shall have shalom; but if he be very wrathful, then be sure that ra'ah is determined by him."
Shmuel Alef,20,8,"Therefore thou shalt deal with chesed unto thy eved; for thou hast brought thy eved into Brit Hashem with thee; notwithstanding, if there be in me avon (iniquity) , slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to avicha?"
Shmuel Alef,20,9,"And Yonatan said, Chalilah (far be it) from thee; for if I had da'as certainly that ra'ah were determined by Avi to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?"
Shmuel Alef,20,10,"Then said Dovid to Yonatan, Who shall tell me? Or what if avicha answer thee roughly?"
Shmuel Alef,20,11,"And Yonatan said unto Dovid, Come, and let us go out into the sadeh. And they went out both of them into the sadeh."
Shmuel Alef,20,12,"And Yonatan said unto Dovid, Hashem Elohei Yisroel, when I have sounded out Avi at this time on Yom HaShishi from now, and, hinei, if there be tov toward Dovid, and I then send not unto thee, and reveal it in thy ozen (ear);"
Shmuel Alef,20,13," Hashem do so and much more to Yonatan; but if it please Avi to do thee ra'ah, then I will reveal it in thy ozen (ear) , and send thee away, that thou mayest go in shalom; and Hashem be with thee, as He hath been with Avi."
Shmuel Alef,20,14,"And thou shalt not only while yet I live show me the chesed Hashem , that I die not;"
Shmuel Alef,20,15,"But also thou shalt not cut off thy chesed from my bais ad olam; no, not when Hashem hath cut off the oyevim of Dovid, every one from the pnei ha'adamah."
Shmuel Alef,20,16,"So Yonatan made Brit with the Bais Dovid, saying, Let Hashem even require it at the hands of the oyevim of Dovid."
Shmuel Alef,20,17,"And Yonatan caused Dovid to swear a shevua again, because he loved him; for he loved him with the ahavat nafsho (with the love of his own nefesh, self)."
Shmuel Alef,20,18,"Then Yonatan said to Dovid, Makhar (tomorrow) is Rosh Chodesh; and thou shalt be missed, because thy moshav (seat) will be empty."
Shmuel Alef,20,19,"And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the makom (place) where thou didst hide thyself on the day of the ma'aseh (deed), and shalt remain by the even (stone) Ezel."
Shmuel Alef,20,20,"And I will shoot three khitzim (arrows) on the side thereof, as though I shot at a matarah (target)."
Shmuel Alef,20,21,"And, hinei, I will send a na'ar, saying, Go, find the khitzim (arrows) . If I expressly say unto the na'ar, Hinei, the khitzim (arrows) are on this side of thee, take them; then come thou, for there is shalom to thee, and no davar (problem, concern) ; as Hashem liveth."
Shmuel Alef,20,22,"But if I say thus unto the elem (youth, young man) , Hinei, the khitzim (arrows) are beyond thee, go thy way; for Hashem hath sent thee away."
Shmuel Alef,20,23,"And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of, hinei, Hashem be between thee and me ad olam."
Shmuel Alef,20,24,"So Dovid hid himself in the sadeh; and when Rosh Chodesh was come, HaMelech sat him down to eat lechem."
Shmuel Alef,20,25,"And HaMelech sat upon his moshav (seat) , as at other times, even upon a moshav by the wall; and Yonatan arose, and Avner sat by Sha'ul ºs side, and Dovid ºs makom (place) was empty."
Shmuel Alef,20,26,"Nevertheless Sha'ul spoke not anything that day; for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not tahor; surely he is not tahor."
Shmuel Alef,20,27,"And it came to pass on the day after Rosh Chodesh, which was the second day of the month, that Dovid ºs makom was empty; and Sha'ul said unto Yonatan bno, Wherefore cometh not Ben Yishai to halechem neither yesterday, nor today?"
Shmuel Alef,20,28,"And Yonatan answered Sha'ul, Dovid earnestly asked leave of me to go to Beit-Lechem;"
Shmuel Alef,20,29,"And he said, Let me go, now; for we have mishpakhat zevach in the Ir; and my brother, he hath commanded me to be there; and now, if I have found chen in thine eyes, let me get away, now, and see my brethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the Shulchan HaMelech."
Shmuel Alef,20,30,"Then af Sha'ul (anger of Sha'ul) was kindled against Yonatan, and he said unto him, Thou ben of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I have da'as that thou hast chosen Ben Yishai to thine own shame, and unto the shame of ervat immecha (thy mother ºs nakedness)?"
Shmuel Alef,20,31,"For as long as Ben Yishai liveth al ha'adamah (upon the earth) thou shalt not be established, nor malkhutecha (thy kingdom) . Wherefore now send and bring him unto me, for he is ben mavet (son of death, he shall surely die)."
Shmuel Alef,20,32,"And Yonatan answered Sha'ul Aviv, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain? What hath he done?"
Shmuel Alef,20,33,And Sha'ul cast the khanit (spear) at him to strike him dead; whereby Yonatan knew that it was determined of Aviv to slay Dovid.
Shmuel Alef,20,34,"So Yonatan arose from the shulchan in chari af (fierce anger) , and did eat no lechem the second day of the month; for he was grieved for Dovid, because Aviv had shamefully humiliated him."
Shmuel Alef,20,35,"And it came to pass in the boker, that Yonatan went out into the sadeh at the mo'ed (appointed time) with Dovid, and a na'ar katon with him."
Shmuel Alef,20,36,"And he said unto his na'ar, Run, find out now the khitzim (arrows) which I shoot. And as the na'ar ran, he shot a khetz beyond him."
Shmuel Alef,20,37,"And when the na'ar was come to the makom of the khetz which Yonatan had shot, Yonatan cried after the na'ar, and said, Is not the khetz beyond thee?"
Shmuel Alef,20,38,"And Yonatan cried after the na'ar, Make speed, haste, stay not. And na'ar Yonatan gathered up the khitzim (arrows) , and came to his adon."
Shmuel Alef,20,39,But the na'ar had no da'as of anything; only Yonatan and Dovid knew the davar (matter).
Shmuel Alef,20,40,"And Yonatan gave his weapons unto his na'ar, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the Ir."
Shmuel Alef,20,41,"And as soon as the na'ar was gone, Dovid arose out of a place toward the negev (south) , and fell on his face to the ground, and prostrated himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until Dovid wept exceedingly."
Shmuel Alef,20,42,"And Yonatan said to Dovid, Go in shalom, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the Shem of Hashem , saying, Hashem be between me and thee, and between my zera and thy zera ad olam. [21:1] And he arose and departed: and Yonatan went into the Ir."
Shmuel Alef,21,1,"Then came Dovid to Nov to Achimelech HaKohen; and Achimelech was afraid at the meeting of Dovid, and said unto him, Why art thou alone, and no ish with thee?"
Shmuel Alef,21,2,"And Dovid said unto Achimelech HaKohen, HaMelech hath commanded me a matter, and hath said unto me, Let no ish know anything of the davar whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee; and I have directed ne'arim to such and such a makom (place)."
Shmuel Alef,21,3,"Now therefore what is under thine yad? Give me five lechem in mine yad, or whatever there is found."
Shmuel Alef,21,4,"And the Kohen answered Dovid, and said, There is no lechem chol (ordinary bread) under mine yad, but there is lechem kodesh; if the ne'arim have kept themselves at least from isha."
Shmuel Alef,21,5,"And Dovid answered the Kohen, and said unto him, Indeed isha have been kept from us yesterday and the day before, since I set out, and the vessels of the ne'arim (young men) are kodesh, and if this is a derech chol (ordinary mission) indeed it will remain kodesh today in their vessels."
Shmuel Alef,21,6,"So the Kohen gave him kodesh; for there was no lechem there but the Lechem HaPanim, that was taken from before Hashem , to be replaced with lechem cham on the day when it was taken away."
Shmuel Alef,21,7,"Now a certain ish of the avadim of Sha'ul was there that day, detained before Hashem ; shmo Do'eg, the Edomi, the chief of the ro'im that belonged to Sha'ul."
Shmuel Alef,21,8,"And Dovid said unto Achimelech, And is there not here under thine yad khanit or cherev? For I have neither brought my cherev nor my weapons with me, because the devar HaMelech (matter of the King) required haste."
Shmuel Alef,21,9,"And the Kohen said, The cherev of Golyat (Goliath) the Pelishti, whom thou slewest in the Emek Elah, hinei, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod; if thou wilt take that, take it; for there is no other except that here. And Dovid said, There is none like that; give it me."
Shmuel Alef,21,10,"And Dovid arose and fled that day from before Sha'ul, and went to Akhish Melech Gat."
Shmuel Alef,21,11,"And the avadim of Akhish said unto him, Is not this Dovid Melech HaAretz? Did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Sha'ul hath slain his thousands, and Dovid his myriads?"
Shmuel Alef,21,12,"And Dovid laid up these devarim in his levav, and was very much afraid of Akhish Melech Gat."
Shmuel Alef,21,13,"And he changed his behavior before them, and feigned himself a madman in their hands, and scratched on the daletot hasha'ar, and let his spittle fall down upon his zakan (beard)."
Shmuel Alef,21,14,"Then said Akhish unto his avadim, Hinei, ye see the man is meshuga; wherefore then have ye brought him to me?"
Shmuel Alef,21,15,"Have I need of meshuga'im, that ye have brought this one to play the meshuga in my presence? Shall this one come into my bais?"
Shmuel Alef,22,1,"Dovid therefore departed from there, and escaped to the me'arah (cave) of Adullam; and when his brethren and all the bais aviv heard it, they went down there to him."
Shmuel Alef,22,2,"And every ish that was in distress, and every ish that was in debt, and every ish that was mar-nefesh (bitter in spirit, discontented) gathered themselves unto him; and he became Sar over them; and there were with him about arba me'ot ish (four hundred men)."
Shmuel Alef,22,3,"And Dovid went from there to Mitzpeh Moav; and he said unto the Melech Moav, Let avi and immi now come out, and be with you, until I know what Elohim will do for me."
Shmuel Alef,22,4,And he brought them before Melech Moav; and they dwelt with him all the days that Dovid was in the metzudah (stronghold).
Shmuel Alef,22,5,"And Gad HaNavi said unto Dovid, Abide not in the metzudah; depart, and get thee into Eretz Yehudah. Then Dovid departed, and came into the Forest of Cheret."
Shmuel Alef,22,6,"When Sha'ul heard that Dovid was discovered, and the anashim that were with him, (now Sha'ul abode in Giv'ah under a tamarisk tree in Ramah, having his khanit in his yad, and all his avadim were standing about him);"
Shmuel Alef,22,7,"Then Sha'ul said unto his avadim that stood about him, Hear now, ye of Binyamin; will Ben Yishai give every one of you sadot and kramim (vineyards) , and make you all sarei alafim and sarei me'ot;"
Shmuel Alef,22,8,"That all of you have made a kesher against me, and there is none that reveals unto my ear that beni (my son) hath cut a Brit with Ben Yishai, and there is none of you that is concerned for me, or revealeth unto my ear that beni (my son) hath stirred up avdi against me, to lie in wait, as he does today?"
Shmuel Alef,22,9,"Then answered Do'eg the Edomi, which was set over the avadim of Sha'ul, and said, I saw Ben Yishai coming to Nov, to Achimelech ben Achituv."
Shmuel Alef,22,10,"And he inquired of Hashem for him, and gave him provision, and gave him the cherev Golyat HaPelishti."
Shmuel Alef,22,11,"Then HaMelech sent to call Achimelech Ben Achituv HaKohen, and kol Bais Aviv, the Kohanim that were in Nov; and they came all of them to HaMelech."
Shmuel Alef,22,12,"And Sha'ul said, Hear now, thou Ben Achituv. And he answered, Hineni, adoni."
Shmuel Alef,22,13,"And Sha'ul said unto him, Why have ye made a kesher against me, thou and Ben Yishai, in that thou hast given him lechem, and a cherev, and hast inquired of Elohim for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as he does this day?"
Shmuel Alef,22,14,"Then Achimelech answered HaMelech, and said, And who is so ne'eman (loyal) among all thy avadim as Dovid, which is the Choson HaMelech, obedient to thy bidding, and is honored in thine bais?"
Shmuel Alef,22,15,"Did I then begin to inquire of Elohim for him? Chalilah li! Let not HaMelech impute anything unto his eved, nor to all the Bais Avi; for thy eved knew nothing of all this, katon or gadol."
Shmuel Alef,22,16,"And HaMelech said, Thou shalt surely die, Achimelech, thou, and kol Bais Avicha."
Shmuel Alef,22,17,"And HaMelech said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the Kohanim of Hashem ; because their yad also is with Dovid, and because they knew when he fled, and did not reveal it in my ear. But the avadim of HaMelech would not put forth their yad to strike the Kohanim of Hashem."
Shmuel Alef,22,18,"And HaMelech said to Do'eg, Turn thou, and strike the Kohanim. And Do'eg the Edomi turned, and he struck the Kohanim, and slaughtered on that day fourscore and five ish that did wear ephod bad (linen robe)."
Shmuel Alef,22,19,"And Nov, the Ir of the Kohanim, he struck with the edge of the cherev, both ish and isha, olel and nursing infants, and shor, and chamor, and seh, with the edge of the cherev."
Shmuel Alef,22,20,"And ben echad of Achimelech Ben Achituv, shmo Evyatar (his name Evyatar), escaped, and fled after Dovid."
Shmuel Alef,22,21,And Evyatar (Abiathar) told Dovid that Sha'ul had slain the Kohanim of Hashem.
Shmuel Alef,22,22,"And Dovid said unto Evyatar (Abiathar) , I knew it that day, when Do'eg the Edomi was there, that he would surely tell Sha'ul. I am mortally responsible for nefesh Bais Avicha."
Shmuel Alef,22,23,"Abide thou with me, fear not; for he that seeketh my nefesh seeketh thy nefesh; but with me thou shalt be mishmeret (in safeguard)."
Shmuel Alef,23,1,"Then they told Dovid, saying, Hinei, the Pelishtim fight against Ke'ilah, and they rob the granot (threshing floors)."
Shmuel Alef,23,2,"Therefore Dovid inquired of Hashem , saying, Shall I go and strike these Pelishtim? And Hashem said unto Dovid, Go, and strike the Pelishtim, and save Ke'ilah."
Shmuel Alef,23,3,"And Anshei Dovid said unto him, Hinei, Anachnu (we) are afraid here in Yehudah; how much more then if we come to Ke'ilah against the maarkhot (military lines) of the Pelishtim?"
Shmuel Alef,23,4,"Then Dovid inquired of Hashem yet again. And Hashem answered him and said, Arise, go down to Ke'ilah; for I will deliver the Pelishtim into thine yad."
Shmuel Alef,23,5,"So Dovid and his anashim went to Ke'ilah, and fought with the Pelishtim, and brought away their livestock, and attacked them with a makkah gedolah (great defeat) . So Dovid saved the inhabitants of Ke'ilah."
Shmuel Alef,23,6,"And it came to pass, when Evyatar (Abiathar) Ben Achimelech fled to Dovid to Ke'ilah, that he came down with the Ephod in his yad."
Shmuel Alef,23,7,"And it was told Sha'ul that Dovid was come to Ke'ilah. And Sha'ul said, Elohim hath delivered him into mine yad; for he is shut in, by entering into an ir (town) that hath gates and bar."
Shmuel Alef,23,8,"And Sha'ul called kol HaAm together for milchamah, to go down to Ke'ilah, to besiege Dovid and his anashim."
Shmuel Alef,23,9,"And Dovid knew that Sha'ul secretly plotted ra'ah (evil, harm) against him; and he said to Evyatar (Abiathar) HaKohen, Bring here the Ephod."
Shmuel Alef,23,10,"Then said Dovid, Hashem Elohei Yisroel, Thy eved hath certainly heard that Sha'ul seeketh to come to Ke'ilah, to destroy the ir (town) on my account."
Shmuel Alef,23,11,"Will the Ba'alei Ke'ilah (citizens of Ke'ilah) deliver me up into his yad? Will Sha'ul come down, as Thy eved hath heard? Hashem Elohei Yisroel, tell now Thy eved. And Hashem said, He will come down."
Shmuel Alef,23,12,"Then said Dovid, Will the Baalei Ke'ilah shut me and my anashim up into the yad Sha'ul? And Hashem said, They will deliver thee up."
Shmuel Alef,23,13,"Then Dovid and his anashim, which were about shesh me'ot ish, arose and departed out of Ke'ilah, and went wherever they could go. And it was told Sha'ul that Dovid was escaped from Ke'ilah; and he refrained from going forth."
Shmuel Alef,23,14,"And Dovid stayed in the midbar in metzadot (strongholds, masadas) and remained on a har in the midbar Ziph. And Sha'ul searched for him every day, but Elohim delivered him not into his yad."
Shmuel Alef,23,15,And Dovid saw that Sha'ul was come out to seek his nefesh: and Dovid was in the midbar Ziph at Chorshah.
Shmuel Alef,23,16,"And Yonatan Ben Sha'ul arose, and went to Dovid at Chorshah, and strengthened his yad in Elohim."
Shmuel Alef,23,17,"And he said unto him, Fear not; for the yad Sha'ul Avi shall not find thee; and thou shalt be Melech over Yisroel, and I shall be mishneh (second) unto thee; and that also Sha'ul Avi knoweth."
Shmuel Alef,23,18,"And they two made a brit (covenant) before Hashem ; and Dovid stayed at Chorshah, and Yonatan went to his bais."
Shmuel Alef,23,19,"Then came up the Ziphim to Sha'ul to Giv'ah, saying, Doth not Dovid hide himself among us in metzadot (strongholds, masadas) at Chorshah, in the hill of Chakhilah, which is on the south of Yeshimon?"
Shmuel Alef,23,20,"Now therefore, O Melech, come down according to all the desire of thy nefesh to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him into the yad HaMelech."
Shmuel Alef,23,21,"And Sha'ul said, Berukhim atem l' Hashem (Blessed be ye of Hashem) ; for ye have compassion on me."
Shmuel Alef,23,22,"Now go, prepare further, and know and see his makom where his hideouts are, and who hath seen him there; for it is told me that he dealeth very craftily."
Shmuel Alef,23,23,"See therefore, and take knowledge of all the machavo'im (hideouts) where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you; it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Yehudah."
Shmuel Alef,23,24,"And they arose, and went to Ziph ahead of Sha'ul; but Dovid and his anashim were in the midbar Ma'on, in the Aravah on the south of Yeshimon."
Shmuel Alef,23,25,"Sha'ul also and his anashim went to seek him. When Dovid was told, he descended and came down to the Sela (Rock) , and stayed in the midbar Ma'on. And when Sha'ul heard that, he pursued Dovid in the midbar Ma'on."
Shmuel Alef,23,26,"And Sha'ul went on this side of the har, and Dovid and his anashim on that side of the har; and Dovid made haste to get away for fear of Sha'ul; for Sha'ul and his anashim encircled Dovid and his anashim round about to take them."
Shmuel Alef,23,27,"But there came a malach unto Sha'ul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Pelishtim have invaded HaAretz."
Shmuel Alef,23,28,"Wherefore Sha'ul returned from pursuing after Dovid, and went against the Pelishtim; therefore they called that makom Sela HaMachlekot (Rock of Escaping)."
Shmuel Alef,23,29,"And Dovid went up from there, and dwelt in metzadot at Ein-Gedi."
Shmuel Alef,24,1,"And it came to pass, when Sha'ul was returned from following the Pelishtim, that it was told him, saying, Hinei, Dovid is in the midbar of Ein-Gedi."
Shmuel Alef,24,2,"Then Sha'ul took shloshet alafim (three thousand) chosen men out of kol Yisroel, and went to search for Dovid and his anashim upon Wild Goat Rocks."
Shmuel Alef,24,3,"And he came to the gidrot hatzon (sheep pens of the flock) on the derech, where was a me'arah (cave) ; and Sha'ul went in to cover his feet, and Dovid and his anashim remained in the far end of the me'arah (cave)."
Shmuel Alef,24,4,"And the anashim of Dovid said unto him, Hinei, the day of which Hashem said unto thee, Hinei, I will deliver thine oyev (enemy) into thine yad, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem tov unto thee. Then Dovid arose, and cut off the corner of the me'il of Sha'ul without his notice."
Shmuel Alef,24,5,"And it came to pass afterward, that the lev Dovid smote him because he had cut off the corner of Sha'ul."
Shmuel Alef,24,6,"And he said unto his anashim, Chalilah (far be it) before Hashem that I should do this thing unto adoni, Hashem  ºs moshiach, to stretch forth mine yad against him, seeing he is the moshiach of Hashem."
Shmuel Alef,24,7,"So Dovid restrained his anashim with these devarim, and allowed them not to rise against Sha'ul. But Sha'ul rose up out of the me'arah (cave) , and went on his derech."
Shmuel Alef,24,8,"Dovid also arose afterward, and went out of the me'arah, and called after Sha'ul, saying, Adoni HaMelech. And when Sha'ul looked behind him, Dovid bowed down with his face to the ground, and prostrated himself."
Shmuel Alef,24,9,"And Dovid said to Sha'ul, Wherefore hearest thou divrei adam, saying, Hinei, Dovid seeketh thy hurt?"
Shmuel Alef,24,10,"Hinei, this day thine eyes have seen how that Hashem had delivered thee today into mine yad in the me'arah; and some urged me kill thee; but mine [nefesh] spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth mine yad against adoni; for he is the moshiach of Hashem."
Shmuel Alef,24,11,"Moreover, avi, see, indeed, see the corner of thy me'il (robe) in my yad; for in that I cut off the corner of thy me'il, and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither ra'ah nor peysha (rebellion) in mine yad, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my nefesh to take it."
Shmuel Alef,24,12," Hashem judge between me and thee, and Hashem avenge me on thee; but mine yad shall not be upon thee."
Shmuel Alef,24,13,"As saith the mashal (proverb) of the ancients, Resha (wickedness) proceedeth from the resha'im; but mine yad shall not be upon thee."
Shmuel Alef,24,14,"After whom is the Melech Yisroel come out? After whom dost thou pursue? After a dead kelev (dog) , after a parosh (flea)."
Shmuel Alef,24,15," Hashem therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and uphold my cause, and deliver me out of thine yad."
Shmuel Alef,24,16,"And it came to pass, when Dovid had made an end of speaking these devarim unto Sha'ul, that Sha'ul said, Is this thy voice, beni Dovid? And Sha'ul lifted up his voice, and wept."
Shmuel Alef,24,17,"And he said to Dovid, Thou art more tzaddik than I; for thou hast rewarded me tovah, whereas I have rewarded thee ra'ah."
Shmuel Alef,24,18,"And thou hast shown this day how that thou hast dealt tovah with me; forasmuch as when Hashem had delivered me into thine yad, thou killedst me not."
Shmuel Alef,24,19,"For if an ish find his oyev, will he let him go bederech tovah? Wherefore Hashem reward thee tovah for that thou hast done unto me this day."
Shmuel Alef,24,20,"And now, hinei, I know that thou shalt surely be Melech, and that the Mamlechet Yisroel shall be established in thine yad."
Shmuel Alef,24,21,"Swear now therefore unto me by Hashem , that thou wilt not cut off my zera after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my shem out of the Bais Avi."
Shmuel Alef,24,22,"And Dovid swore unto Sha'ul. And Sha'ul went to his bais; but Dovid and his anashim went up unto the metzudah (stronghold, masada)."
Shmuel Alef,25,1,"And Shmuel died; and kol Yisroel were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him at his bais at Ramah. And Dovid arose, and went down to the midbar Paran."
Shmuel Alef,25,2,"And there was an ish in Ma'on, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the ish was gadol me'od, and he had three thousand tzon, and a thousand izzim (goats) ; and he was shearing his tzon in Carmel."
Shmuel Alef,25,3,"Now the shem of the ish was Naval; and the shem of his isha Avigal; and she was an isha of tovat seichel, and beautiful; but the ish was kasheh (churlish, difficult) and rah (mean) in his doings; and he was a descendant of Kalev."
Shmuel Alef,25,4,And Dovid heard in the midbar that Naval did shear his tzon.
Shmuel Alef,25,5,"And Dovid sent out ten ne'arim, and Dovid said unto the ne'arim, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Naval, and give him a shalom greeting in my shem (name);"
Shmuel Alef,25,6,"And thus shall ye say to him, Koh lechai (good fortune to you) , shalom to thee, shalom to thine bais, shalom unto all that thou hast."
Shmuel Alef,25,7,"And now I have heard that thou hast shearers; now thy ro'im (shepherds) which were with us, we hurt them not, and nothing was missing by them, all the while they were in Carmel."
Shmuel Alef,25,8,"Ask thy ne'arim, and they will show thee. Wherefore let the ne'arim find chen (favor, grace) in thine eyes; for we come on yom tov; give, now, whatsoever cometh to thine yad unto thy avadim, and to thy ben, Dovid."
Shmuel Alef,25,9,"And when the naarei Dovid came, they spoke to Naval according to all those devarim b'shem Dovid, and ceased."
Shmuel Alef,25,10,"And Naval answered the avadim of Dovid, and said, Who is Dovid? And who is Ben Yishai? There be many avadim nowadays who break away every ish from his adon."
Shmuel Alef,25,11,"Shall I then take my lechem, and my mayim, and my meat that I have slaughtered for my shearers, and give it unto anashim who come from I know not where?"
Shmuel Alef,25,12,"So the ne'arim of Dovid turned to their derech, and went back, and came and told him all those devarim."
Shmuel Alef,25,13,"And Dovid said unto his anashim, Gird ye on every ish his cherev. And they girded on every ish his cherev; and Dovid also girded on his cherev; and there went up after Dovid about arba me'ot ish; and two hundred stayed by the kelim (supplies)."
Shmuel Alef,25,14,"But one of the ne'arim told Avigal, eshet Naval, saying, Hinei, Dovid sent malachim out of the midbar to put a brocha on adoneinu; and he drove them off."
Shmuel Alef,25,15,"But the anashim were tovim unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we accompanied them, when we were in the sadeh;"
Shmuel Alef,25,16,"They were a chomah (wall) unto us both by lailah gam yomam (night and day) , all the while we were with them shepherding hatzon."
Shmuel Alef,25,17,"Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for ra'ah is determined against adoneinu, and against all his bais; for he is such a ben Beliyaal, that a man cannot speak to him."
Shmuel Alef,25,18,"Then Avigal made haste, and took two hundred lechem, and two skins of yayin, and five tzon ready cooked, and five measures of roasted grain, and a hundred raisin cakes, and two hundred pressed figs, and laid them on chamorim (donkeys)."
Shmuel Alef,25,19,"And she said unto her ne'arim, Go on ahead of me; hineni, I come after you. But she told not her ish Naval."
Shmuel Alef,25,20,"And it was so, as she rode on the chamor, that she came down by the covert on the har, hinei, Dovid and his anashim came down toward her; and she met them."
Shmuel Alef,25,21,"Now Dovid had said, Surely for sheker have I been shomer over all that this one hath in the midbar, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him; and he hath requited me ra'ah for tovah."
Shmuel Alef,25,22,"So and more also do Elohim unto the oyvei Dovid, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the boker any that urinate against the wall."
Shmuel Alef,25,23,"And when Avigal saw Dovid, she hasted, dismounted the chamor, and fell before Dovid on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,"
Shmuel Alef,25,24,"And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, adoni, upon me let this avon be; and let now thine handmaid speak in thine audience, and hear the devarim of thine handmaid."
Shmuel Alef,25,25,"Let now not adoni regard this ish of Beliyaal, even Naval; for as shmo is, so is he; Naval (fool) is shmo, and nevalah (folly) is with him; but I thine handmaid saw not the ne'arim of adoni, whom thou didst send."
Shmuel Alef,25,26,"Now therefore, adoni, as Hashem liveth, and as thy nefesh liveth, seeing Hashem hath held thee back from coming to shed dahm, and from avenging thyself with thine own yad, now let thine oyevim, and they that seek ra'ah for adoni, be as Naval."
Shmuel Alef,25,27,"And now this brocha which thine shifchah (maid-servant) hath brought unto adoni, let it even be given unto the ne'arim that follow at the feet of adoni."
Shmuel Alef,25,28,"Forgive now the peysha of thine handmaid; for Hashem will certainly make adoni a bais ne'eman; because adoni fighteth the milchamot of Hashem , and ra'ah hath not been found in thee all thy yamim."
Shmuel Alef,25,29,"Yet adam is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy nefesh; but the nefesh of adoni shall be bound in the bundle of chayyim with Hashem Eloheicha; and the nefesh of thine oyevim, them shall He hurl away, as out of the hollow of a kela (slingshot)."
Shmuel Alef,25,30,"And it shall come to pass, when Hashem shall have done to adoni according to all the tovah that He hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee Nagid over Yisroel,"
Shmuel Alef,25,31,"There shall be no grief unto thee, nor michshol lev (downfall of conscience) unto adoni, either that thou hast committed shefach dahm chinom, or that adoni hath avenged himself; but when Hashem shall have dealt well with adoni, then remember thine handmaid."
Shmuel Alef,25,32,"And Dovid said to Avigal, Baruch Hashem Elohei Yisroel, Who sent thee today to meet me;"
Shmuel Alef,25,33,"And baruch be thy good sense, and berukhah be thou, who hast kept me this yom from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself with mine own yad."
Shmuel Alef,25,34,"For in very deed, as Hashem Elohei Yisroel liveth, Who hath kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Naval by ohr haboker any that urinates against the wall."
Shmuel Alef,25,35,"So Dovid received of her yad that which she had brought him, and said unto her, Go up in shalom to thine bais; see, I have paid heed to thy voice, and have granted thy request."
Shmuel Alef,25,36,"And Avigal came to Naval; and, hinei, he held a mishteh (feast) in his bais, like the mishteh of a melech; and lev Naval was tov within him, for he was shikkor ad me'od; wherefore she told him nothing, katan or gadol, until the ohr haboker."
Shmuel Alef,25,37,"But it came to pass in the boker, when the yayin was gone out of Naval, and his isha had told him these things, that his lev died within him, and he became like even (stone)."
Shmuel Alef,25,38,"It came to pass about ten yamim later, Hashem struck Naval, that he died."
Shmuel Alef,25,39,"And when Dovid heard that Naval was dead, he said, Baruch Hashem , that hath upheld the cause of my cherpah (reproach) from the yad of Naval, and hath kept his eved from ra'ah; for Hashem hath returned the ra'ah (wickedness) of Naval upon his own rosh. And Dovid sent and communed with Avigal, to take her to him as isha."
Shmuel Alef,25,40,"And when the avadim of Dovid were come to Avigal to Carmel, they spoke unto her, saying, Dovid sent us unto thee, to take thee to him as isha."
Shmuel Alef,25,41,"And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the ground, and said, Hinei, let thine handmaid be for a shifchah to wash the feet of the avadim of adoni."
Shmuel Alef,25,42,"And Avigal hasted, and arose and rode upon a chamor, with five na'arot of hers that attended her; and she went after the malachim of Dovid, and became his isha."
Shmuel Alef,25,43,Dovid also took Achino'am of Yizre'el; and they were also both of them his nashim (wives).
Shmuel Alef,25,44,"But Sha'ul had given Michal bitto (his daughter) , Dovid ºs isha, to Palti Ben Layish, who was from Gallim."
Shmuel Alef,26,1,"And the Ziphim came unto Sha'ul at Giv'ah, saying, Doth not Dovid hide himself in the hill of Chakhilah, which faces Yeshimon?"
Shmuel Alef,26,2,"Then Sha'ul arose, and went down to the midbar Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Yisroel with him, to search for Dovid in the midbar Ziph."
Shmuel Alef,26,3,"And Sha'ul encamped in the hill of Chakhilah, which faces Yeshimon, beside the derech (road) . But Dovid stayed in the midbar, and he saw that Sha'ul came after him into the midbar."
Shmuel Alef,26,4,"Dovid therefore sent out scouts, and understood that Sha'ul had indeed come."
Shmuel Alef,26,5,"And Dovid arose, and came to the makom where Sha'ul had encamped; and Dovid beheld the makom where Sha'ul lay down, and Avner Ben Ner, the sar of his tzava (army) ; and Sha'ul was lying in the camp, and HaAm encamped round about him."
Shmuel Alef,26,6,"Then answered Dovid and said to Achimelech the Chitti, and to Avishai Ben Tzeruyah, achi Yoav, saying, Who will go down with me to Sha'ul to the machaneh? And Avishai said, I will go down with thee."
Shmuel Alef,26,7,"So Dovid and Avishai came to HaAm by lailah; and, hinei, Sha'ul lay sleeping within the camp, and his khanit (spear) stuck in the ground at his head; but Avner and HaAm lay round about him."
Shmuel Alef,26,8,"Then said Avishai to Dovid, Elohim hath delivered thine oyev into thine yad today; now therefore let me strike him, now, with the khanit, pinning him to the ground once; I will not strike him the second time."
Shmuel Alef,26,9,"And Dovid said to Avishai, Destroy him not; for who can stretch forth his yad against Hashem  ºs moshiach, and be guiltless?"
Shmuel Alef,26,10,"Dovid said furthermore, As Hashem liveth, Hashem shall strike him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into milchamah, and perish."
Shmuel Alef,26,11,"Chalilah (far be it) from me by Hashem that I should stretch forth mine yad against Hashem  ºs moshiach; but, take now thou the khanit (spear) that is at his head, and the flask of mayim, and let us go."
Shmuel Alef,26,12,"So Dovid took the khanit and the flask of mayim from near Sha'ul ºs head; and they got them away, and no one saw it, nor knew it, neither awaked; for they were all asleep; because a tardamat Hashem was fallen upon them."
Shmuel Alef,26,13,"Then Dovid went over to the other side, and stood on the top of the har afar off; a great space being between them;"
Shmuel Alef,26,14,"And Dovid called out to the people, and to Avner Ben Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Avner? Then Avner answered and said, Who art thou that calls out to HaMelech?"
Shmuel Alef,26,15,"And Dovid said to Avner, Art not thou an ish (man) ? And who is like to thee in Yisroel? Wherefore then hast thou not been shomer over adoneicha HaMelech? For there came one of HaAm in to destroy HaMelech adoneicha."
Shmuel Alef,26,16,"This thing is not tov that thou hast done. As Hashem liveth, ye are worthy for mavet, because ye have not been shomer over adoneichem, Hashem  ºs moshiach. And now see where the khanit of HaMelech is, and the flask of mayim that was near his head."
Shmuel Alef,26,17,"And Sha'ul knew the voice of Dovid, and said, Is this thy voice, beni, Dovid? And Dovid said, It is my voice, adoni HaMelech."
Shmuel Alef,26,18,"And he said, Why doth adoni thus pursue after his eved? For what have I done? Or what ra'ah is in mine yad?"
Shmuel Alef,26,19,"Now therefore, let adoni HaMelech hear the devarim of his eved. If Hashem have stirred thee up against me, let Him accept a minchah; but if they be bnei adam, cursed be they before Hashem ; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the nachalah of Hashem , saying, Go, serve elohim acharim."
Shmuel Alef,26,20,"Now therefore, let not my dahm fall to the earth before the face of Hashem ; for the Melech Yisroel is come out to search for a parosh (flea) , as when one doth hunt the partridge in the harim."
Shmuel Alef,26,21,"Then said Sha'ul, I have sinned; return, beni Dovid; for I will no more do thee harm, because my nefesh was precious in thine eyes this day; hinei, I was foolish, and have erred exceedingly."
Shmuel Alef,26,22,"And Dovid answered and said, Hinei the khanit HaMelech! Let one of the ne'arim come over and bring it back."
Shmuel Alef,26,23," Hashem repay to every ish his tzedakah and his emunah; for Hashem delivered thee into my yad today, but I would not stretch forth mine yad against Hashem  ºs moshiach."
Shmuel Alef,26,24,"And, hinei, as thy nefesh was much valued this day in mine eyes, so let my nefesh be much valued in the eyes of Hashem , and let Him deliver me out of all tzarah (trouble)."
Shmuel Alef,26,25,"Then Sha'ul said to Dovid, Baruch atah, beni Dovid; may thou both accomplish many things, and also still succeed. So Dovid went on his derech, and Sha'ul returned to his makom."
Shmuel Alef,27,1,"And Dovid said in his lev, I shall now perish yom echad by the yad Sha'ul; there is nothing tov for me than that I should speedily escape into the Eretz Pelishtim; and Sha'ul shall despair of searching for me any more in kol gevul Yisroel; so shall I escape out of his yad."
Shmuel Alef,27,2,"And Dovid arose, and he passed over with the shesh me'ot ish that were with him unto Akhish Ben Maoch Melech Gat."
Shmuel Alef,27,3,"And Dovid dwelt with Akhish at Gat, he and his anashim, every ish with his bais (household) , even Dovid with his two nashim, Achino'am of Yizre'el, and Avigal eshet Naval of Karmel."
Shmuel Alef,27,4,And it was told Sha'ul that Dovid was fled to Gat; and he sought no more again for him.
Shmuel Alef,27,5,"And Dovid said unto Akhish, If I have now found chen in thine eyes, let them give me a makom (place) in some town in the sadeh (country) , that I may dwell there; for why should thy eved dwell in the ir hamamlachah (royal city) with thee?"
Shmuel Alef,27,6,Then Akhish gave him Tziklag that day; therefore Tziklag belongs unto the Melachim of Yehudah unto this day.
Shmuel Alef,27,7,And the mispar hayamim that Dovid dwelt in the sadeh of the Pelishtim was four months and two days.
Shmuel Alef,27,8,"And Dovid and his anashim went up, and raided the Geshuri, and the Girzi, and the Amaleki; for they were of old the inhabitants of HaAretz, as thou goest to Shur, even unto Eretz Mitzrayim."
Shmuel Alef,27,9,"And Dovid attacked the land, and left neither ish nor isha alive, and took away the tzon, and the bakar, and the chamorim, and the gemalim, and the begadim, and returned, and came to Akhish."
Shmuel Alef,27,10,"And Akhish said, Where have ye raided today? And Dovid said, Against the Negev of Yehudah, or against the Negev of the Yerachme'eli, or against the Negev of the Keni."
Shmuel Alef,27,11,"And Dovid saved neither ish nor isha alive, to bring [news] to Gat, saying, Lest they should inform on us, saying, So did Dovid, and so has been his mishpat (practice) all the yamim (days) he dwelleth in the sadeh of the Pelishtim (Philistines)."
Shmuel Alef,27,12,"And Akhish believed Dovid, saying, He hath made his people Yisroel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be eved to me olam (forever)."
Shmuel Alef,28,1,"And it came to pass in those yamim, that the Pelishtim gathered their machanot together for tzava (warfare) , to fight with Yisroel. And Akhish said unto Dovid, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me to machaneh, thou and thy anashim."
Shmuel Alef,28,2,"And Dovid said to Akhish, Surely thou shalt know what thy eved will do. And Akhish said to Dovid, Therefore will I make thee my shomer rosh (head bodyguard) kol hayamim."
Shmuel Alef,28,3,"Now Shmuel was dead, and kol Yisroel had mourned him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own town. And Sha'ul had deported the ovot (mediums, those with familiar spirits) , and the yidonim (spiritists) from HaAretz."
Shmuel Alef,28,4,"And the Pelishtim gathered themselves together, and came and encamped in Shunem; and Sha'ul gathered kol Yisroel together, and they encamped in Gilboa."
Shmuel Alef,28,5,"And when Sha'ul saw the machaneh of the Pelishtim, he was afraid, and his lev greatly trembled."
Shmuel Alef,28,6,"And when Sha'ul inquired of Hashem, Hashem answered him not, neither by chalomot (dreams) , nor by Urim, nor by nevi'im."
Shmuel Alef,28,7,"Then said Sha'ul unto his avadim, Seek me an isha that is a ba'alat ov (medium, a person with a familiar spirit) , that I may go to her, and inquire of her. And his avadim said to him, Hinei, there is an eshet ba'alat ov at Ein-Dor."
Shmuel Alef,28,8,"And Sha'ul disguised himself, and put on begadim acherim, and he went, and two anashim with him, and they came to the isha by lailah; and he said, divine for me by the ov (familiar spirit) , and bring him up for me, whom I shall name unto thee."
Shmuel Alef,28,9,"And the isha said unto him, Hinei, thou knowest what Sha'ul hath done, how he hath cut off the ovot (mediums, those with familiar spirits) , and the yidoni (spiritist) from HaAretz; why then layest thou a snare for my nefesh, to cause me to die?"
Shmuel Alef,28,10,"And Sha'ul vowed to her by Hashem , saying, As Hashem liveth, there shall no avon (punishment) happen to thee for this thing."
Shmuel Alef,28,11,"Then said the isha, Whom shall I bring up for thee? And he said, Bring up Shmuel for me."
Shmuel Alef,28,12,"And when the isha saw Shmuel, she cried with a kol gadol (loud voice) ; and the isha spoke to Sha'ul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? For thou art Sha'ul."
Shmuel Alef,28,13,"And HaMelech said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the isha said unto Sha'ul, I see elohim olim (spirits, ones ascending, a spirit ascending) from HaAretz."
Shmuel Alef,28,14,"And he said unto her, Of what form is he? And she said, An ish zaken cometh up; and he is wearing a me'il (robe) . And Sha'ul had da'as that it was Shmuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground, and prostrated himself."
Shmuel Alef,28,15,"And Shmuel said to Sha'ul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Sha'ul answered, I am greatly distressed; for the Pelishtim make war against me, and Elohim has turned away from me, and answereth me no more, neither by nevi'im, nor by chalomot (dreams) : therefore I have called on thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I should do."
Shmuel Alef,28,16,"Then said Shmuel, Why then dost thou ask of me, seeing Hashem is turned away from thee, and is become thine adversary?"
Shmuel Alef,28,17,"And Hashem hath done for Himself just as He spoke by me; for Hashem hath torn the Mamlachah out of thine yad, and given it to thy re'a (neighbor) , even to Dovid:"
Shmuel Alef,28,18,"Because thou obeyedst not the kol (voice) of Hashem , nor executedst His charon af upon Amalek, therefore hath Hashem done this thing unto thee this day."
Shmuel Alef,28,19,"Moreover Hashem will also deliver Yisroel with thee into the yad (hand, power) of the Pelishtim; and makhar (tomorrow) shalt thou and thy banim be with me; Hashem also shall deliver the machaneh Yisroel into the yad Pelishtim."
Shmuel Alef,28,20,"Then at once Sha'ul fell his full length on the ground, and was greatly afraid, because of the divrei Shmuel; and there was no ko'ach in him; for he had eaten no lechem all the yom, nor all the lailah."
Shmuel Alef,28,21,"And the isha came unto Sha'ul, and saw that he was greatly terrified, and said unto him, Hinei, thine shifcha hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put my nefesh in my palm, and have paid heed unto thy devarim which thou spoke unto me."
Shmuel Alef,28,22,"Now therefore, shema (pay heed) thou now also unto the voice of thine shifcha, and let me set some lechem before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have ko'ach, when thou goest on thy derech."
Shmuel Alef,28,23,"But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his avadim, together with the isha, urged him; and he paid heed unto their voice. So he arose from ha'aretz, and sat upon the mittah (bed)."
Shmuel Alef,28,24,"And the isha had a fattened egel in the bais; and she hasted, and slaughtered it, and took kemakh (flour) , and kneaded it, and did bake matzot thereof;"
Shmuel Alef,28,25,"And she brought it before Sha'ul, and before his avadim; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that lailah."
Shmuel Alef,29,1,Now the Pelishtim gathered together all their machanot to Aphek; and Yisroel encamped by an ayin (spring) which is in Yizre'el.
Shmuel Alef,29,2,"And the rulers of the Pelishtim (Philistines) were passing by with me'ot, and with alafim; but Dovid and his anashim were passing at the rearguard with Akhish."
Shmuel Alef,29,3,"Then said the sarim of the Pelishtim, What are these Ivrim doing here? And Akhish said unto the sarim of the Pelishtim, Is not this Dovid, the eved of Sha'ul Melech Yisroel, which hath been with me these yamim, or these shanim, and unto this day I have found no fault in him since he defected?"
Shmuel Alef,29,4,"And the sarim of the Pelishtim were angry with him; and the sarim of the Pelishtim said unto him, Send the ish back, that he may turn again to his makom (place, home) which thou hast assigned him, and let him not go down with us to milchamah, lest in the milchamah he be as satan (adversary, antagonist) to us; for wherewith should he make himself acceptable unto his adon? Is it not with the heads of these anashim?"
Shmuel Alef,29,5,"Is not this Dovid, of whom they sang one to another in mecholot (dances) , saying, Sha'ul slaughtered his alafim, and Dovid his revavot (myriads)?"
Shmuel Alef,29,6,"Then Akhish called Dovid, and said unto him, Surely, as Hashem liveth, thou hast been yashar (upright) , and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the machaneh is tov in my sight; for I have not found ra'ah in thee since the day of thy coming unto me until this day; nevertheless, in the eyes of the rulers thou art not tov."
Shmuel Alef,29,7,"Wherefore now shuv (turn, turn back) , and go in shalom, that thou displease not the rulers of the Pelishtim."
Shmuel Alef,29,8,"And Dovid said unto Akhish, But what have I done? And what hast thou found in thy eved from the day that I am before thee until this day, that I may not go fight against the oyevei adoni HaMelech?"
Shmuel Alef,29,9,"And Akhish answered and said to Dovid, I know that thou art tov in my sight, as a malach Elohim; notwithstanding, the sarim of the Pelishtim have said, He shall not go up with us to the milchamah."
Shmuel Alef,29,10,"Wherefore now rise up early in the boker with the avadim of thy adon that are come with thee; and as soon as ye get up early in the boker, and have ohr, depart."
Shmuel Alef,29,11,"So Dovid and his anashim rose up early to depart in the boker, to return to Eretz Pelishtim. And the Pelishtim went up to Yizre'el."
Shmuel Alef,30,1,"And it came to pass, when Dovid and his anashim were come to Tziklag on the Yom HaShelishi, that the Amaleki had made a raid on the Negev and Tziklag and attacked Tziklag, and burned it with eish;"
Shmuel Alef,30,2,"And had captured the nashim, that were therein; they killed not any, either gadol or katon, but carried them off, and went on their derech."
Shmuel Alef,30,3,"So Dovid and his anashim came to the Ir, and, hinei, it was aflame with eish; and their nashim, and their banim, and their banot, had been taken captive."
Shmuel Alef,30,4,"Then Dovid and HaAm that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more ko'ach to weep."
Shmuel Alef,30,5,"And Dovid ºs two nashim were taken captive, Achino'am the Yizre'elit, and Avigal eshet Naval the Karmeli."
Shmuel Alef,30,6,"And Dovid was greatly distressed; for HaAm spoke of stoning him, because the nefesh of kol HaAm was marah (bitter) , every ish for his banim and for his banot; but Dovid made himself chazak in Hashem Elohav."
Shmuel Alef,30,7,"And Dovid said to Evyatar HaKohen Ben Achimelech, Bring me now here the Ephod. And Evyatar brought the Ephod to Dovid."
Shmuel Alef,30,8,"And Dovid inquired of Hashem , saying, Shall I pursue after this gedood? Shall I overtake it? And He answered him, Pursue; for thou shalt surely overtake, and without fail save."
Shmuel Alef,30,9,"So Dovid went, he and shesh me'ot ish that were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed."
Shmuel Alef,30,10,"But Dovid pursued, he and arba me'ot ish; for two hundred stayed behind, which were so exhausted that they could not go over the brook Besor."
Shmuel Alef,30,11,"And they found an Egyptian in the sadeh, and brought him to Dovid, gave him lechem, and he did eat; they made him drink mayim;"
Shmuel Alef,30,12,"And they gave him a piece of pressed fig cake, and two raisin cakes; and when he had eaten, his ruach returned to him; for he had eaten no lechem, nor drunk any mayim, shloshah yamim and shloshah lailot."
Shmuel Alef,30,13,"And Dovid said unto him, To whom belongest thou? And from where art thou? And he said, I am a na'ar Mitzri, eved to an Amaleki; and my adon left me, because yamim sheloshah ago I fell sick."
Shmuel Alef,30,14,"We made a raid upon the south of the Kereti, and upon the territory of Yehudah, and upon the south of Kalev; and we burned Tziklag with eish."
Shmuel Alef,30,15,"And Dovid said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this gedood? And he said, Swear unto me by Elohim, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my adon, and I will lead thee down to this gedood."
Shmuel Alef,30,16,"And when he had led him down, hinei, they were spread out over the surface of kol ha'aretz, eating and drinking, and revelling, because of all the great plunder that they had taken from Eretz Pelishtim, and from Eretz Yehudah."
Shmuel Alef,30,17,"And Dovid struck them from the neshef (twilight, evening) even unto the erev of the next day; and there escaped not an ish of them, except four hundred na'ar, which rode off upon gemalim, and fled."
Shmuel Alef,30,18,And Dovid recovered all that Amalek had carried away; and Dovid saved his two nashim.
Shmuel Alef,30,19,"And there was nothing of them missing, lacking neither katon nor gadol, neither banim nor banot, neither plunder, nor anything that they had taken for them; Dovid recovered all."
Shmuel Alef,30,20,"And Dovid took all the tzon and the bakar, which they drove before those other mikneh, and said, This is shalal Dovid (the plunder of David)."
Shmuel Alef,30,21,"And Dovid came to the two hundred anashim, which were so exhausted that they could not follow Dovid, whom they had left behind also at the brook Besor; and they went forth to meet Dovid, and to meet HaAm that were with him; and when Dovid came near to the people, he gave them a shalom greeting."
Shmuel Alef,30,22,"Then answered all the ish rah and the Beliyaal among the anashim of those that went with Dovid, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them any of the shalal that we have recovered, except to every ish his isha and his banim, that they may take them and leave."
Shmuel Alef,30,23,"Then said Dovid, Ye shall not do so, my achim, with that which Hashem hath given us, Who hath been shomer over us, and delivered the gedood that came against us into our yad."
Shmuel Alef,30,24,"For who will pay heed unto you in this matter? But as his chelek is that goeth down to the milchamah (battle) , so shall his chelek be that tarrieth by the kelim (supplies) : their chelek they shall share alike."
Shmuel Alef,30,25,"And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a chok (statute) and a mishpat for Yisroel unto this day."
Shmuel Alef,30,26,"And when Dovid came to Tziklag, he sent of the shalal (plunder) unto the Ziknei Yehudah, even to his re'im (friends) , saying, Hinei, a brocha for you of the shalal (plunder) of the oyevim of Hashem;"
Shmuel Alef,30,27,"To them which were in Beit-El, and to them which were in Ramot of the South, and to them which were in Yatir,"
Shmuel Alef,30,28,"And to them which were in Aro'er, and to them which were in Siphmot, and to them which were in Eshtemo'a,"
Shmuel Alef,30,29,"And to them which were in Rachal, and to them which were in the cities of the Yerachme'eli, and to them which were in the cities of the Keni,"
Shmuel Alef,30,30,"And to them which were in Chormah, and to them which were in Bor-'Ashan, and to them which were in Atakh,"
Shmuel Alef,30,31,"And to them which were in Chevron, and to all the mekomot (places) where Dovid himself and his anashim were accustomed to visit."
Shmuel Alef,31,1,"Now the Pelishtim fought against Yisroel; and the anshei Yisroel fled from before the Pelishtim, and fell down chalalim (slain ones) on Mt Gilboa."
Shmuel Alef,31,2,"And the Pelishtim followed hard upon Sha'ul and upon his banim; and the Pelishtim slaughtered Yehonatan, and Avinadav, and Malki-Shu'a, the Bnei Sha'ul."
Shmuel Alef,31,3,"And the milchamah became intense against Sha'ul, and the archers overtook him; and he was mortally wounded by the archers."
Shmuel Alef,31,4,"Then said Sha'ul unto his noseh keli (armor bearer) , Draw thy cherev, and thrust me through therewith; lest these arelim (uncircumcised ones) come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his noseh keli would not; for he was very afraid. Therefore Sha'ul took a cherev, and fell upon it."
Shmuel Alef,31,5,"And when his noseh keli saw that Sha'ul was dead, he fell likewise upon his cherev, and died with him."
Shmuel Alef,31,6,"So Sha'ul died, and his shloshet banim, and his noseh keli, and kol anashim of him, that same day together."
Shmuel Alef,31,7,"And when the anshei Yisroel that were on the other side of the emek (valley) , and they that were on the other side of the Yarden, saw that the anshei Yisroel fled, and that Sha'ul and his banim were dead, they abandoned the towns, and fled; and the Pelishtim came and took occupation of them."
Shmuel Alef,31,8,"And it came to pass on the next day, when the Pelishtim came to strip the chalalim, that they found Sha'ul and his shloshet banim fallen on Mt Gilboa."
Shmuel Alef,31,9,"And they cut off his rosh (head) , and stripped off his keli, and sent through eretz Pelishtim all around, to publish it in the bais atzabim, and among the people."
Shmuel Alef,31,10,And they put his keli in the Bais Ashtarot; and they hung up his body on the chomat Beit-Shan.
Shmuel Alef,31,11,And when the inhabitants of Yavesh Gil'ad heard of that which the Pelishtim had done to Sha'ul;
Shmuel Alef,31,12,"kol ish chayil arose, and went kol halailah, and took the geviyyat Sha'ul and the geviyyot of his banim from the chomat Beit-Shan, and came to Yavesh, and cremated them there."
Shmuel Alef,31,13,"And they took their atzmot, and buried them under a tree at Yavesh, and underwent a tzom shivat yamim."
