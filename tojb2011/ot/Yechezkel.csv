Yechezkel,1,1,"Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, while I was among those of the Golus by the Nahar Kevar, that Shomayim was opened, and I saw mar'ot Elohim."
Yechezkel,1,2,"In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of the Golus of HaMelech Yoyakhin,"
Yechezkel,1,3,"The Devar Hashem came expressly unto Yechezkel the kohen, ben Buzi, in Eretz Kasdim (Chaldeans) by the Nahar Kevar; and the Yad Hashem was there upon him."
Yechezkel,1,4,"And I looked, and, hinei, a ruach se'arah came out of the tzafon, an anan gadol, and flashing fire, with brilliant light all about it, and out of the midst thereof something gleaming, shining out of the midst of the eish."
Yechezkel,1,5,Also out of the midst thereof came the demut (likeness) of four Chayos. And this was their appearance: they had the demut adam.
Yechezkel,1,6,"And every one had arba'ah panim, and every one had arba kenafayim."
Yechezkel,1,7,And their regalim were regel yesharah; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a regel egel; and they gleamed like the shining of burnished nechoshet.
Yechezkel,1,8,And they had the hands of an adam under their kenafayim on their four sides; and they four had their panim and their kenafayim.
Yechezkel,1,9,Their kenafayim were joined one to another; they turned not as they went; they went every one face forward.
Yechezkel,1,10,"As for the demut of their panim, they four had the face of an adam, and the face of an aryeh, on the right side; and they four had the face of a shor on the left side; they four also had the face of a nesher."
Yechezkel,1,11,"Thus were their panim; and their kenafayim were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their geviyot."
Yechezkel,1,12,"And they went every one face forward; whither the Ruach was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went."
Yechezkel,1,13,"As for the demut of the Chayos, their appearance was like coals of eish burning, and like the appearance of lapidim (torches) ; it spread back and forth among the Chayos; and the eish was brilliant, and out of the eish went forth barak (lightning)."
Yechezkel,1,14,And the Chayos ran and returned as the appearance of bazak (a flash of lightning).
Yechezkel,1,15,"Now as I beheld the Chayos, hinei there was one Ofan ba'aretz etzel the Chayos, with its four panim."
Yechezkel,1,16,The appearance of the Ofanim and their making was like unto the color of tarshish; and they four had one demut; and their appearance and their making was as it were an Ofan within an Ofan.
Yechezkel,1,17,Arba'at (four) sidedly they went; and they turned not as they went.
Yechezkel,1,18,"As for their rims, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rims were mele'ot einayim saviv (full of eyes round about) the four of them."
Yechezkel,1,19,"And when the Chayos went, the Ofanim went beside them; and when the Chayos were lifted up from ha'aretz, the Ofanim were lifted up."
Yechezkel,1,20,"Whithersoever the Ruach was to go, they went, thither was the Ruach to go; and the Ofanim were lifted facing them; for Ruach HaChayah was in the Ofanim."
Yechezkel,1,21,"When those went, these went; and when those stood still, these stood still; and when those were lifted up from ha'aretz, the Ofanim were lifted up facing them; for the Ruach HaChayah was in the Ofanim."
Yechezkel,1,22,"And the demut of the raki'a upon the rashei HaChayah was as the color of terrible ice crystal, spread out upward above their rashim."
Yechezkel,1,23,"And under the raki'a were their kenafayim stretched out, the one toward the other; every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their geviyot."
Yechezkel,1,24,"And when they went, I heard the kol of their kenafayim, like the kol of mayim rabbim, as the Kol Shaddai, the voice of a tumult, as the sound of a machaneh; when they stood still, they let down their kenafayim."
Yechezkel,1,25,"And there was a kol (voice) from the raki'a that was over their rosh, when they stood still, and had let down their kenafayim."
Yechezkel,1,26,"And above the raki'a that was over their rosh was the demut kisse, as the appearance of a precious stone, a sapphire; and upon the demut hakisse was the demut like the appearance of adam above upon it."
Yechezkel,1,27,"And I saw something gleaming, shining out like the appearance of eish; inside it all around, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw something like the appearance of eish, and it had radiance all around."
Yechezkel,1,28,"As the appearance of the keshet (rainbow) that is in the anan in yom hageshem, so was the appearance of the radiance all around. This was the appearance of the demut Kavod Hashem . And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spoke."
Yechezkel,2,1,"And He said unto me, Ben Adam, stand upon thy raglayim, and I will speak unto thee."
Yechezkel,2,2,"And the Ruach entered into me just as He spoke unto me, and stood me upon my raglayim, that I heard Him that spoke unto me."
Yechezkel,2,3,"And He said unto me, Ben Adam, I send thee to the Bnei Yisroel, to Goyim HaMoredim (Rebellious Nations) that hath rebelled against Me; they and their Avot have rebelled against Me, even unto this very day."
Yechezkel,2,4,"For they are stubborn banim and chizkei lev (stiff-hearted) . I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,2,5,"And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will refrain from heeding — for they are a bais meri (house of rebellion) , yet shall they know that there hath been a navi among them."
Yechezkel,2,6,"And thou, Ben Adam, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their devarim, though briers and thorns be with thee, and thou dost dwell among akrabim (scorpions) ; be not afraid of their devarim, nor be afraid at their looks, for they are a bais meri."
Yechezkel,2,7,"And thou shalt speak My devarim unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will refrain from heeding; for they are meri (rebellious)."
Yechezkel,2,8,"But thou, Ben Adam, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou meri (rebellious) like that bais hameri (rebellious house) . Open thy mouth and eat what I give thee."
Yechezkel,2,9,"And when I looked, hinei, a yad was sent unto me; and, hinei, a megillat sefer was therein;"
Yechezkel,2,10,"And He unrolled the megillah before me; and it was written on front and back: and there was written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe."
Yechezkel,3,1,"Moreover He said unto me, Ben Adam, eat that thou findest; eat this megillah, and go speak unto Bais Yisroel."
Yechezkel,3,2,"So I opened my mouth, and He caused me to eat that megillah."
Yechezkel,3,3,"And He said unto me, Ben Adam, cause thy beten to eat, and fill thy bowels with this megillah that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as devash for sweetness."
Yechezkel,3,4,"And He said unto me, Ben Adam, go, get thee unto the Bais Yisroel, and speak My words unto them."
Yechezkel,3,5,"For thou art not sent to an Am Imkei Safah (a people of indecipherable language) and of obscure lashon, but to Bais Yisroel;"
Yechezkel,3,6,"Not to amim rabbim of indecipherable language and obscure lashon whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have paid heed unto thee."
Yechezkel,3,7,But Bais Yisroel will not pay heed unto thee; for they will not pay heed unto Me; for kol Bais Yisroel are khizkei metzach (hard-set of brow) and keshei-lev (hard-hearted).
Yechezkel,3,8,"Hinei, I have made thy face chazakim against their faces, and thy metzach chazak (forehead strong) against their metzach."
Yechezkel,3,9,"As a shamir (adamant, hardest stone) more chazak than flint have I made thy metzach (forehead) ; fear them not, neither be terrified at their looks, though they be a bais meri (house of rebellion)."
Yechezkel,3,10,"Moreover He said unto me, Ben Adam, all My words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine lev, and hear with thine oznayim."
Yechezkel,3,11,"And go, get thee to them of the Golus, unto the Bnei Amecha, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem ; whether they will hear, or whether they will refrain."
Yechezkel,3,12,"Then the Ruach lifted me and took me up, and I heard behind me a kol ra'ash gadol (a voice of a great rustling) , saying, Baruch Kavod Hashem from His makom (place, home)."
Yechezkel,3,13,"I heard also the noise of the wings of the Chayos that touched one another, and the noise of the Ofanim (wheels) opposite them, and a voice of ra'ash gadol."
Yechezkel,3,14,"So the Ruach lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in mar (bitterness) , in the anger of my ruach; but the yad Hashem was chazah upon me."
Yechezkel,3,15,"Then I came to them of the Golus at Tel-Aviv, that dwelt by the Nahar Kevar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there speechlessly astounded among them shivat yamim."
Yechezkel,3,16,"And it came to pass at the end of shivat yamim, that the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,3,17,"Ben Adam, I have made thee a tzofeh (watchman) unto the Bais Yisroel; therefore hear the word at My mouth, and give them warning from Me."
Yechezkel,3,18,"When I say unto the rasha, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the rasha from his derech harasha'ah, to save his life; the same rasha shall die in his avon; but I will hold accountable thine yad for his dahm."
Yechezkel,3,19,"Yet if thou warn the rasha, and he turn not from his resha, nor from his derech harasha'ah, he shall die in his avon; but thou hast saved thy nefesh."
Yechezkel,3,20,"Again, When a tzaddik doth turn from his tzedek, and commit evil, and I lay a michshol (stumbling block of temptation) before him, he shall die; because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his chattat, and his tzidkot which he hath worked shall not be remembered; but I will hold accountable thine yad for his dahm."
Yechezkel,3,21,"Nevertheless if thou warn the tzaddik, that the tzaddik sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast saved thy nefesh."
Yechezkel,3,22,"And the Yad Hashem (Hand, Power of Hashem) was there upon me; and He said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there speak with thee."
Yechezkel,3,23,"Then I arose, and went forth into the plain; and, hinei, the Kavod Hashem stood there, as the Kavod which I saw by the Nahar Kevar; I fell on my face."
Yechezkel,3,24,"Then the Ruach entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spoke with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself in the confines of thine bais."
Yechezkel,3,25,"But thou, O Ben Adam, hinei, they tied on thee ropes, and have bound thee with them, that thou canst not go out among them;"
Yechezkel,3,26,"And I will make thy leshon cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be mute, and shalt not be to them an ish mokhi'ach (admonisher) ; for they are a bais meri."
Yechezkel,3,27,"But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem ; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that refuseth, let him refuse; for they are a bais meri."
Yechezkel,4,1,"Thou also, Ben Adam, take thee a levenah (tile, brick) , and lay it before thee, and engrave upon it the Ir, even Yerushalayim;"
Yechezkel,4,2,"And lay matzor (siege) against it, and erect against it siege works, and build a ramp against it; set the machanot also against it, and set battering rams against it all around."
Yechezkel,4,3,"Moreover take thou unto thee a machavat barzel (iron griddle) , and set it for a kir barzel (wall of iron) between thee and the Ir; and set thy face against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This shall be an ot (sign) to Bais Yisroel."
Yechezkel,4,4,"Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the avon Bais Yisroel upon it; according to the mispar of the yamim that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their avon."
Yechezkel,4,5,"For I have laid upon thee the shanim of their avon (iniquity) , according to the mispar (number) of the yamim, three hundred and ninety days; so shalt thou bear the avon Bais Yisroel."
Yechezkel,4,6,"And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the avon Bais Yehudah forty days; I have appointed thee a day for each year."
Yechezkel,4,7,"Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the Matzor Yerushalayim (Siege of Jerusalem) , and thine zero'a shall be bared, and thou shalt prophesy against it."
Yechezkel,4,8,"And, hinei, I will tie ropes upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another, till thou hast ended the days of thy matzor (siege)."
Yechezkel,4,9,"Take thou also unto thee chittin (wheat) , and se'orim (barley) , and fol (beans) , and adosim (lentils) , and dochan (millet) , and kussemim (spelt) , and put them in keli echad, and make thee lechem thereof, according to the mispar of the yamim that thou shalt lie upon thy side, three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof."
Yechezkel,4,10,"And thy okhel (food) which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day; from time to time shalt thou eat it."
Yechezkel,4,11,"Thou shalt drink also mayim by measure, the sixth part of a hin: from time to time shalt thou drink."
Yechezkel,4,12,"And thou shalt eat it as cakes of se'orim, and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of ha'adam, in their sight."
Yechezkel,4,13,"And Hashem said, Even thus shall the Bnei Yisroel eat their lechem tameh among the Goyim, whither I will drive them."
Yechezkel,4,14,"Then said I, Not so Adonoi Hashem ! Hinei, my nefesh hath not been made tuma'ah for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten nevelah or trefah; neither came there basar piggul into my mouth."
Yechezkel,4,15,"Then He said unto me, Behold, I have given thee cattle dung instead of dung of adam, and thou shalt prepare thy lechem therewith."
Yechezkel,4,16,"Moreover He said unto me, Ben Adam, hinei, I will break the mateh lechem (staff of bread, food supply) in Yerushalayim: and they shall eat lechem weighted out in rations, and with worry; and they shall drink mayim by measure, and with amazed alarm:"
Yechezkel,4,17,"In order that lechem and mayim be scarce, and that every ish and achiv be confounded with shock and rot away because of their avon."
Yechezkel,5,1,"And thou, Ben Adam, take thee a sharp cherev, take thee a barberʼs ta'ar (razor) , and cause it to pass upon thine rosh and upon thy zakan (beard) : then take thee scales for weighing and divide the hair."
Yechezkel,5,2,"Thou shalt burn with flame a third part in the midst of the Ir, when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou shalt take a third part, and strike it all around with the cherev: and a third part thou shalt scatter in the ruach; and I will draw out the cherev after them."
Yechezkel,5,3,"Thou shalt also take thereof a few in mispar, and bind them in the folds of thy robes."
Yechezkel,5,4,"Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the eish, and burn them in the eish; for thereof shall an eish spread unto kol Bais Yisroel."
Yechezkel,5,5,Thus saith Adonoi Hashem ; This is Yerushalayim: I have set it in the midst of the Goyim and countries that are all around her.
Yechezkel,5,6,"And she hath rebelled against My mishpatim with resha'ah more than the Goyim, and My chukkot more than the countries that are all around her: for they have refused My mishpatim and My chukkot, they have not walked in them."
Yechezkel,5,7,"Therefore thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Because more than the Goyim that are all around you, ye have been ungovernable, and have not walked in My chukkot, neither have done My mishpatim, neither have done according to the mishpatim of the Goyim that are all around you;"
Yechezkel,5,8,"Therefore thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Hineni, I, even I, am against thee, and will execute mishpatim in the midst of thee in the sight of the Goyim."
Yechezkel,5,9,"And I will do to thee that which I have not done, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of kol to'avot of thee."
Yechezkel,5,10,"Therefore the avot shall eat banim in the midst of thee, and the banim shall eat their avot; and I will execute shefatim (judgments, punishments) in thee, and kol she'erit of thee will I scatter unto kol ruach."
Yechezkel,5,11,"Therefore, as I live, saith Adonoi Hashem ; Surely, because thou hast made My Mikdash tameh with all thy shikkutzim, and with all thine to'avot, therefore will I also withdraw; neither shall Mine eye pity, neither will I spare."
Yechezkel,5,12,"A third part of thee shall die by dever, and by ra'av shall they be consumed in the midst of thee: and a third part shall fall by the cherev all around thee; and I will scatter a third part into kol ruach, and I will draw out a cherev after them."
Yechezkel,5,13,"Thus shall Mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause My chemah to be satisfied against them, and I will be avenged: and they shall know that I Hashem have spoken in My kinah, when I have accomplished My chemah against them."
Yechezkel,5,14,"Moreover I will make thee a ruin, and a cherpah among the Goyim that are all around thee, before the eyes of all that pass by."
Yechezkel,5,15,"So it shall be a cherpah (reproach) and a gedufah (taunt) , a musar and a meshammah (astonishment, object of horror) unto the Goyim that are all around thee, when I shall execute shefatim (judgments) on thee in anger and in chemah and in tokhchot chemah (furious rebukes) . I Hashem have spoken."
Yechezkel,5,16,"When I shall send upon them disastrous khitzim (arrows) of ra'av (famine) , which shall be for mashchit (destruction) , and which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the ra'av (famine) upon you, and will break your mateh lechem (staff of bread, food supply):"
Yechezkel,5,17,"So will I send upon you ra'av (famine) and chayyah ra'ah (wild beasts) , and they shall leave thee bereaved as childless: and dever and dahm shall pass through thee; and I will bring the cherev upon thee. I Hashem have spoken."
Yechezkel,6,1,"And the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,6,2,"Ben Adam, set thy face toward the mountains of Yisroel, and prophesy against them,"
Yechezkel,6,3,"And say, Ye mountains of Yisroel, hear the Devar Adonoi Hashem ; Thus saith Adonoi Hashem to the harim (mountains) , and to the geva'ot (hills) , to the ravines, and to the valleys: Hineni, I, even I, will bring a cherev upon you, and I will destroy your high places."
Yechezkel,6,4,"And your [idolatrous] mizbechot shall be decimated, and your incense altars shall be demolished; and I will cast down your slain before your gillulim (idols)."
Yechezkel,6,5,And I will lay the pigrei Bnei Yisroel (dead bodies of the children of Israel) before their gillulim; and I will scatter your atzmot all around your mizbechot.
Yechezkel,6,6,"In all your moshevot (dwellings) the towns shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate; that your mizbechot will be laid waste and made desolate, and your gillulim (idols) will be broken and cease, and your incense altars will be cut down, and your ma'asim will be abolished."
Yechezkel,6,7,"And the chalal (slain) shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I am Hashem."
Yechezkel,6,8,"Yet will I leave a remnant, that ye may have some that shall escape the cherev among the Goyim, when ye shall be scattered among the countries."
Yechezkel,6,9,"And they that escape of you shall remember Me among the Goyim where they shall be carried captive, how I have known hurt by the lev hazoneh of them which turned away from Me, and by their einayot hazonot which went a-whoring after their gillulim; they shall lothe themselves for the ra'ot (evils) which they have committed in all their to'avot."
Yechezkel,6,10,"And they shall know that I am Hashem , and that I have not served warning el-chinnom (in vain) that I would bring hara'ah hazot upon them."
Yechezkel,6,11,"Thus saith Adonoi Hashem ; strike with thine hand, and stamp with thy regel, and say, Alas for kol to'avot ra'ot Bais Yisroel! For they shall fall by cherev (sword) , by ra'av (famine) , and by dever (plague)."
Yechezkel,6,12,He that is far off shall die by dever; and he that is near shall fall by cherev; and he that surviveth and is besieged shall die by ra'av (famine) ; thus will I accomplish My chemah (fury) upon them.
Yechezkel,6,13,"Then shall ye know that I am Hashem , when their slain shall be among their gillulim all around their mizbechot, upon every givah ramah (high hill) , in all the tops of the harim, and under every spreading tree, and under every leafy elah (oak tree) , the makom (place) where they did offer rei'ach nicho'ach to all their gillulim."
Yechezkel,6,14,"So will I stretch out My yad upon them, and make HaAretz desolate, yes, more desolate than the midbar toward Divlah, in all their moshevot (dwellings) ; then they shall know that I am Hashem."
Yechezkel,7,1,"Moreover the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,7,2,"Also, thou ben adam, thus saith Adonoi Hashem unto Eretz Yisroel: Ketz (End) , the End is come upon the four corners of ha'aretz."
Yechezkel,7,3,"Now is the Ketz (End, Doom) come upon thee, and I will send Mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy drakhim, and will repay thee for all thine to'avot (abominations)."
Yechezkel,7,4,"And Mine eye shall not pity thee, neither will I spare; but I will repay thy drakhim upon thee, and thine to'avot shall be in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I am Hashem."
Yechezkel,7,5,"Thus saith Adonoi Hashem ; A ra'ah, a singular ra'ah, hinei, has come."
Yechezkel,7,6,"Ketz is come, the ketz is come; it is ripe for thee; hinei, it is come."
Yechezkel,7,7,"The Tzefirah (the Web) is come upon thee, O thou that dwellest in ha'aretz; the time is come, the Yom Mehumah (Day of Panic) is near, and not of rejoicing in the harim."
Yechezkel,7,8,"Now will I shortly pour out My fury upon thee, and spend Mine anger upon thee; and I will judge thee according to thy drakhim, and will repay thee for all thine to'avot."
Yechezkel,7,9,"And Mine eye shall not pity, neither will I spare; I will repay thee according to thy drakhim and thine to'avot that are in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I am Hashem that striketh."
Yechezkel,7,10,"Hinei, the Yom, hinei, it is come; The Tzefirah (Web) is gone forth; the mateh (rod) hath blossomed, zadon (pride) hath budded."
Yechezkel,7,11,"Chamas is risen up into mateh resha (a rod of wickedness) ; none of them shall remain, nor of their tumult, nor of any of theirʼs; none of their preeminence."
Yechezkel,7,12,"The time is come, the day draweth near; let not the koneh (buyer) rejoice, nor the mokher (seller) mourn; for charon (wrath) is upon all the multitude thereof."
Yechezkel,7,13,"For the mokher (seller) shall not return to that which is sold, as long as his life is alive; for the chazon (vision) concerns the whole multitude thereof, which shall not be reversed; neither shall any strengthen himself in the avon of his life."
Yechezkel,7,14,"They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goeth to the milchamah; for My charon (wrath) is upon all the multitude thereof."
Yechezkel,7,15,"The cherev is outside, and the dever and the ra'av (famine) inside; he that is in the sadeh shall die with the cherev; and he that is in the Ir, ra'av (famine) and dever shall devour him."
Yechezkel,7,16,"But they that survive of them shall escape, and shall be on the harim like doves of the ge'ayot (valleys) , all of them moaning, every one for his avon."
Yechezkel,7,17,"All hands shall go limp, and all birkayim (knees) shall be weak as mayim."
Yechezkel,7,18,"They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and terror shall cover them; and bushah (shame) shall be upon all faces, and shaved scalps upon all their heads."
Yechezkel,7,19,"They shall cast their kesef in the streets, and their zahav shall be like niddah; their kesef and their zahav shall not be able to save them in the Yom Evrat Hashem (Day of the Wrath of Hashem) ; they shall not satisfy their nefashot, neither fill their stomachs; for it has become the stumbling block of their avon."
Yechezkel,7,20,"As for the beauty of his jewelry, he set it in ga'on (pride) ; but they made the tzelem of their to'avot and of their shikkutzim therein; therefore I will make it like niddah to them."
Yechezkel,7,21,"And I will give it into the hands of the zarim (strangers) for plunder, and to the resha'im of ha'aretz for loot; and they shall defile it."
Yechezkel,7,22,"My face will I turn also from them, and they shall desecrate My treasure; for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it."
Yechezkel,7,23,"Make a chain; for ha'aretz is full of mishpat damim, and the ir is full of chamas."
Yechezkel,7,24,"Therefore I will bring the worst of the Goyim, and they shall possess their batim (houses) ; I will also make the ga'on (pride) of the mighty to cease; and their mikdashim (holy places) shall be defiled."
Yechezkel,7,25,"Terror cometh; and they shall seek shalom, and there shall be none."
Yechezkel,7,26,"Disaster shall come upon disaster, and rumor shall be upon rumor; then shall they seek a chazon (vision) from the navi; but the torah shall perish from the kohen, and etzah from the zekenim (elders)."
Yechezkel,7,27,"HaMelech shall mourn, and the nasi shall be clothed with despair, and the hands of the am ha'aretz shall fearfully tremble; I will do unto them according to their derech, and according to their mishpatim will I judge them; and they shall know that I am Hashem."
Yechezkel,8,1,"And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in mine bais, and the zekenim of Yehudah sat before me, that the yad Adonoi Hashem fell there upon me."
Yechezkel,8,2,"Then I beheld, and hinei a demut (likeness) as of the appearance of eish; from the appearance of His waist and downward, eish; and from His waist and upward, as the appearance of zohar (brightness) , as of gleaming amber."
Yechezkel,8,3,"And He put forth the form of a yad, and took me by a lock of mine rosh; and the Ruach lifted me up between Ha'Aretz and Shomayim, and brought me in mar'ot Elohim ([divinely granted] visions) to Yerushalayim, to the Petach Sha'ar Hapenimit (entrance of the inner gate) , the one facing north; where was the moshav (seat) of the semel hakinah (statue of jealousy) , which provoketh [ Hashem ʼs] jealousy."
Yechezkel,8,4,"And, hinei, the Kavod Elohei Yisroel was there, according to the mareh (vision) that I saw in the plain."
Yechezkel,8,5,"Then said He unto me, Ben adam, lift up thine eynayim now the derech (toward) north. So I lifted up mine eynayim the derech (toward) north, and hinei northward at the Sha'ar HaMizbe'ach was this semel hakinah in the entrance."
Yechezkel,8,6,"He said furthermore unto me, Ben adam, seest thou what they do? Even the to'evot gedolot (great abominations) that Bais Yisroel committeth here, causing that I go far off from My Mikdash? But turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see to'evot gedolot (greater abominations)."
Yechezkel,8,7,"And He brought me to the petach (entrance) of the khatzer (court) ; and when I looked, hinei, a hole in the kir (wall)!"
Yechezkel,8,8,"Then said He unto me, Ben adam, dig now in the kir (wall) ; and when I had dug in the kir (wall) , hinei, a petach (entrance)."
Yechezkel,8,9,"And He said unto me, Go in, and behold the to'evot hara'ot (wicked abominations) that they do here."
Yechezkel,8,10,"So I went in and saw; and, hinei, every form of remes (creeping things) , and behemah sheketz (abominable beasts) , and all the gillulim (idols) of the Bais Yisroel, portrayed upon the kir (wall) all around."
Yechezkel,8,11,"And there stood before them seventy ish of the zekenim of the Bais Yisroel, and in the midst of them stood Ya'azanyahu Ben Shaphan, with every ish his mikteret (censer, incense burner) in his yad; and a thick anan (cloud) of ketoret (incense) went up."
Yechezkel,8,12,"Then said He unto me, Ben adam, hast thou seen what the zekenim of Bais Yisroel do in the choshech (dark) , every ish in the cheder (room) of his maskit (image) ? For they say, Hashem seeth us not; Hashem hath forsaken ha'aretz."
Yechezkel,8,13,"He said also unto me, Turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see to'evot gedolot (greater abominations) that they do."
Yechezkel,8,14,"Then He brought me to the petach sha'ar Beis Hashem toward the north; and, hinei, there sat nashim weeping for Tammuz."
Yechezkel,8,15,"Then said He unto me, Hast thou seen this, O ben adam? Turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see to'evot gedolot (greater abominations) than these."
Yechezkel,8,16,"And He brought me into the khatzer Beis Hashem hapenimit, and, hinei, at the petach (entrance) of the Heikhal Hashem , between the Ulam and the Mizbe'ach, were about five and twenty ish, with their backs toward the Heikhal Hashem , and their faces toward the east; and they bowing down toward the east worshiping the sun."
Yechezkel,8,17,"Then He said unto me, Hast thou seen this, O ben adam? Is it a trivial thing to Bais Yehudah that they commit the to'evot (abominations) which they commit here? For they have filled ha'aretz with chamas, and yet have returned to provoke Me to anger; and, behold, they put the branch to their nose."
Yechezkel,8,18,"Therefore will I also deal in chemah (fury) ; Mine eye shall not pity, neither will I spare; and though they cry in Mine oznayim with a kol gadol, yet will I not hear them."
Yechezkel,9,1,"Then He cried also in mine oznayim with a kol gadol (loud voice) , saying, Cause them that have charge over the Ir to draw near, even every ish with his keli mashchet (destroying weapon) in his yad."
Yechezkel,9,2,"And, hinei, shishah anashim (six men) came from the derech of the Sha'ar HaElyon, which lieth toward the north, and every ish a keli mapatz (slaughter weapon) of his in his yad; and one ish among them was clothed with linen, with a keset hasofer (writing case) at his side; and they went in, and stood beside the Mizbe'ach HaNechoshet."
Yechezkel,9,3,"And the Kavod Elohei Yisroel was gone up from the Keruv (Cherub) , whereupon it was, to the miftan HaBeis [HaMikdash] (the Threshold of the Beis [HaMikdash]) . And He called to the ish clothed with linen, which had the keset hasofer at his side;"
Yechezkel,9,4,"And Hashem said unto him, Go through the midst of the Ir, through the midst of Yerushalayim, and put a TAV upon the mitzekhot (foreheads) of the anashim that grieve and lament for kol hato'evot that are being done in the midst thereof."
Yechezkel,9,5,"And to the others He said in mine hearing, Go ye through the Ir after him, and strike down; let not your eye have pity, and do not spare;"
Yechezkel,9,6,"Slay utterly zaken (old man) and bochur (young man) , betulah, little children, and nashim; but come not near any ish upon whom is the TAV; and begin at My Mikdash. Then they began with the anashim hazekenim which were before the Beis."
Yechezkel,9,7,"And He said unto them, Make the Beis tameh, and fill the khatzerot (coutyards) with chalalim (slain ones) ; go ye forth. And they went forth, and slaughtered in the Ir."
Yechezkel,9,8,"And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried out, and said, Ah, Adonoi Hashem ! Wilt Thou destroy kol She'erit Yisroel in Thy pouring out of Thy chemah (wrath, fury) upon Yerushalayim?"
Yechezkel,9,9,"Then He said unto me, The avon Bais Yisroel and Yehudah is exceeding great, and HaAretz is full of damim, and the Ir full of injustice; for they say, Hashem hath forsaken Ha'Aretz, and Hashem seeth not."
Yechezkel,9,10,"And as for Me, Mine eye shall show no pity, neither will I spare, but I will recompense their derech upon their rosh."
Yechezkel,9,11,"And, hinei, the ish clothed with linen, which had the keset ([writing] case) at his side, reported, saying, I have done as Thou hast commanded me."
Yechezkel,10,1,"Then I looked, and, hinei, above the raki'a that was over the rosh of the Keruvim there appeared over them something like a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the demut (likeness) of a kisse (throne)."
Yechezkel,10,2,"And He spoke unto the ish clothed with linen, and said, Come in between the galgal (wheelwork) , even under the Keruv, and fill thine yad with coals of eish from among the Keruvim, and scatter them over the Ir. And he went in in my sight."
Yechezkel,10,3,"Now the Keruvim stood on the right side of the Beis, when the ish went in; and the anan (cloud) filled the khatzer hapenimit (innermost courtyard)."
Yechezkel,10,4,"Then the Kavod Hashem went up from the Keruv, and stood over the threshold of the Beis; and the Beis was filled with the anan (cloud) , and the khatzer (courtyard) was full of the radiance of the Kavod Hashem."
Yechezkel,10,5,"And the sound of the wings of the Keruvim was heard even as far as the khatzer hakhitzonah (the outer court) , like the voice of El Shaddai when He speaketh."
Yechezkel,10,6,"And it came to pass, that when He had commanded the ish clothed with linen, saying, Take eish from between the Galgal (Wheelwork) , from between the Keruvim; then he went in, and stood beside the Ofan (Wheel)."
Yechezkel,10,7,"And one Keruv stretched forth his yad from between the Keruvim unto the eish that was between the Keruvim, and took thereof, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen: who took it, and went out."
Yechezkel,10,8,And Keruvim appeared to have the tavnit (form) of a yad adam under their kenafayim (wings).
Yechezkel,10,9,"And when I looked, hinei, the four Ofanim (wheels) by the Keruvim, one Ofan beside one Keruv, and another Ofan beside another Keruv: and the appearance of the Ofanim was like the color of tarshish even (stone)."
Yechezkel,10,10,"And as for their appearance, there was one demut (likeness) for the four of them, like that it was the Ofan within the Ofan."
Yechezkel,10,11,"When they went, they went toward their four sides; they did not turn aside as they went, but to the makom (place) where the rosh looked they followed it; they did not turn aside as they went."
Yechezkel,10,12,"And their whole basar, and their backs, and their hands, and their kenafayim (wings) , and the Ofanim, were full of eynayim all around, even the Ofanim that they four had."
Yechezkel,10,13,"As for the Ofanim, they were called in my hearing, The Galgal!"
Yechezkel,10,14,"And every one had four panim (faces) : the first face was the face of a Keruv, and the second face was the face of an Adam, and the third face of an Aryeh, and the fourth the face of a Nesher."
Yechezkel,10,15,And the Keruvim were lifted up. This is the Chayah (Living Creature) that I saw by the Kevar River.
Yechezkel,10,16,"And when the Keruvim went, the Ofanim went beside them: and when the Keruvim lifted up their kenafayim (wings) to mount up from ha'aretz, the Ofanim turned not away from beside them."
Yechezkel,10,17,"When they stood, these stood; and when they were lifted up, these lifted up themselves also: for the Ruach of the Chayah was in them."
Yechezkel,10,18,"Then the Kavod Hashem departed from off the threshold of the Beis, and stood over the Keruvim."
Yechezkel,10,19,"And the Keruvim lifted up their kenafayim (wings) , and mounted up from ha'aretz before my eyes: when they went out, the Ofanim also were beside them, and every one stood at the petach sha'ar Beis Hashem hakadmoni (eastern gate of the Beis HaMikdash of Hashem) ; and the Kavod Elohei Yisroel was over them from above."
Yechezkel,10,20,This is the Chayah that I saw under Elohei Yisroel by the Kevar River; and I knew that they were the Keruvim.
Yechezkel,10,21,"Every one had four panim (faces) each, and every one four kenafayim (wings) ; and the demut (likeness) of the yedei adam (human hand) was under their kenafayim (wings)."
Yechezkel,10,22,"And the demut (likeness) of their panim (faces) was the same panim which I saw by the Kevar River, their appearances and themselves: they went every one straight forward."
Yechezkel,11,1,"Moreover the Ruach lifted me up, and brought me unto the Sha'ar Beis Hashem hakadmoni (eastern gate of the Beis HaMikdash of Hashem) , and hinei at the petach of the Sha'ar five and twenty ish; among whom I saw Ya'azanyah Ben Azur, and Pelatyahu Ben Benayahu, sarim of HaAm."
Yechezkel,11,2,"Then said He unto me, Ben adam, these are the anashim that plot evil, and give atzat rah (evil counsel) in this ir,"
Yechezkel,11,3,"Which say, The end is not near; let us build batim (houses) : this ir is the caldron, and we are the basar."
Yechezkel,11,4,"Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O ben adam."
Yechezkel,11,5,"And the Ruach Hashem fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak: Thus saith Hashem ; Thus have ye said, O Bais Yisroel: for I know the things that come into your ruach, every one of them."
Yechezkel,11,6,"Ye have multiplied your slain in this ir, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain."
Yechezkel,11,7,"Therefore thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Your slain whom ye have placed in the midst of it, they are the basar, and this ir is the caldron; but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it."
Yechezkel,11,8,"Ye have feared the cherev; and I will bring a cherev upon you, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,11,9,"And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the yad of zarim, and will execute shefatim (judgments) among you."
Yechezkel,11,10,Ye shall fall by the cherev; I will judge you at the border of Yisroel; and ye shall know that I am Hashem.
Yechezkel,11,11,"This ir shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the basar in the midst thereof; but I will judge you at the border of Yisroel;"
Yechezkel,11,12,"And ye shall know that I am Hashem ; for ye have not walked in My chukkot, neither executed My mishpatim, but have done after the mishpatim of the Goyim that are all around you."
Yechezkel,11,13,"And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatyahu Ben Benayah died. Then I fell down upon my face, and cried out with a kol gadol, and said, Ah, Adonoi Hashem ! Wilt Thou make a full end of the she'erit (remnant) Yisroel?"
Yechezkel,11,14,"Again the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,11,15,"Ben adam, thy brethren, even thy relatives, the anashim of thy geulah, and kol Bais Yisroel wholly, are those of whom the inhabitants of Yerushalayim have said, They have gone far from Hashem ; unto us is this land given in possession."
Yechezkel,11,16,"Therefore say, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem ; Although I have cast them far off among the Goyim, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a mikdash me'at (little holy place) in the countries where they went."
Yechezkel,11,17,"Therefore say, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem ; I will even gather you from the nations, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you Eretz Yisroel."
Yechezkel,11,18,"And they shall come there, and they shall remove all the shikkutzim thereof and all the to'avot (abominations) thereof from her."
Yechezkel,11,19,"And I will give them a lev echad, and I will put a ruach chadashah (new regenerated spirit) within you; and I will remove the lev haeven (heart of stone) out of their basar, and will give them a lev basar;"
Yechezkel,11,20,"That they may walk in My chukkot, and be shomer over Mine mishpatim, and do them; and they shall be My people, and I will be their Elohim."
Yechezkel,11,21,"But as for them whose lev walketh after the lev of their shikkutzim and their to'avot, I will repay their derech upon their own rosh, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,11,22,"Then did the Keruvim lift up their wings, and the Ofanim (wheels) beside them; and the Kavod Elohei Yisroel was high above them."
Yechezkel,11,23,"And the Kavod Hashem went up from the midst of the Ir, and stood upon the har which is on the east side of the ir."
Yechezkel,11,24,"Afterward the Ruach lifted me up, and brought me in a mar'eh (vision) [inspired] by the Ruach Elohim into Kasdim (Chaldea, Babylon) , to them of the Golus. So the mareh (vision) that I had seen went up from me."
Yechezkel,11,25,Then I spoke unto them of the Golus all the things that Hashem had showed me.
Yechezkel,12,1,"The Davar Hashem also came unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,12,2,"Ben adam, thou dwellest in the midst of a bais hameri (rebellious house) which have eynayim to see, and see not; they have oznayim to hear, and hear not; for they are a bais meri (house of rebellion)."
Yechezkel,12,3,"Therefore, thou ben adam, pack for the Golus thy belongings and go into captivity by day before their eyes; and thou shalt remove from thy makom (place, home) to another makom in their sight; it may be they will consider, though they be bais meri (a rebellious house)."
Yechezkel,12,4,"Then shalt thou bring forth thy gear by day in their sight, as gear for the Golus; and thou shalt go forth at erev in their sight, as they that go forth into the Golus."
Yechezkel,12,5,"Dig thou through the kir (wall) in their sight, and carry out [everything] thereby."
Yechezkel,12,6,"In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy katef (shoulder) , and carry it forth in the twilight; thou shalt cover thy face, that thou see not ha'aretz; for I have set thee for a mofet (sign, symbol, portent) unto Bais Yisroel."
Yechezkel,12,7,"And I did so as I was commanded. I brought forth my gear by day, as gear for the Golus, and at erev I dug through the kir (wall) with mine yad; I carried it forth in the twilight, and I bore it upon my katef (shoulder) in their sight."
Yechezkel,12,8,"And in the boker came the Devar Hashem unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,12,9,"Ben adam, hath not Bais Yisroel, the bais hameri (the rebellious house) , said unto thee, What doest thou?"
Yechezkel,12,10,"Say thou unto them, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem ; This massa (burden) concerneth the nasi in Yerushalayim, and kol Bais Yisroel that are among them."
Yechezkel,12,11,"Say, I am your mofet; just as I have done, so shall it be done unto them: they shall be carried away into the Golus and go into captivity."
Yechezkel,12,12,"And the nasi that is among them shall bear [his gear] upon his katef (shoulder) in the twilight, and shall go forth; they shall dig through the kir (wall) to carry out thereby; he shall cover his face, that he see not ha'aretz with the ayin (eye)."
Yechezkel,12,13,"My net also will I spread over him, and he shall be caught in My snare; and I will bring him to Bavel to Eretz Kasdim (Chaldeans) ; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there."
Yechezkel,12,14,"And I will scatter toward every ruach (wind) all that are about him to help him, and all his troops; and I will draw out the cherev after them."
Yechezkel,12,15,"And they shall know that I am Hashem , when I shall scatter them among the Goyim, and disperse them throughout the countries."
Yechezkel,12,16,"But I will leave a few anashim of them from the cherev, from the ra'av (famine) , and from the dever; that they may declare all their to'avot among the Goyim to where they come; and they shall know that I am Hashem."
Yechezkel,12,17,"Moreover the Devar Hashem came to me, saying,"
Yechezkel,12,18,"Ben adam, eat thy lechem with fearful shaking, and drink thy mayim with trembling and with anxiety;"
Yechezkel,12,19,"And say unto the am ha'aretz: Thus saith Adonoi Hashem regarding the inhabitants of Yerushalayim, and of Admat Yisroel (Land of Israel) ; they shall eat their lechem with anxiety, and, as desolate, drink their mayim, because her land shall be desolate from all that is therein, because of the chamas of all them that dwell therein."
Yechezkel,12,20,"And the towns that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and ha'aretz shall be desolate; and ye shall know that I am Hashem."
Yechezkel,12,21,"And the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,12,22,"Ben adam, what is that mashal that ye have in Admat Yisroel, saying, The days drag on, and every chazon (vision) faileth [to come to anything]."
Yechezkel,12,23,"Tell them therefore, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : I will make this mashal to cease, and they shall no more use it as a mashal in Yisroel; but say unto them, The days are at hand, even the fulfillment of kol chazon."
Yechezkel,12,24,For there shall be no more any chazon shav (vain vision) nor smooth divination within Bais Yisroel.
Yechezkel,12,25,"For I am Hashem : I will speak, and the davar that I shall speak shall come to pass; it shall be no more delayed; for in your days, O Bais Hameri (O Rebellious House) , will I say the Davar (Word) , and will fulfill it, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,12,26,"Again the Devar Hashem came to me, saying."
Yechezkel,12,27,"Ben adam, hinei, they of Bais Yisroel say, The chazon that he seeth is for yamim rabbim to come, and he prophesieth of the times that are far off."
Yechezkel,12,28,"Therefore say unto them, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem ; There shall none of My Devarim be delayed any more, but the Davar which I have spoken shall be done, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,13,1,"And the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,13,2,"Ben adam, prophesy against the nevi'im of Yisroel that prophesy, and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own levavot, Hear ye the Devar Hashem;"
Yechezkel,13,3,"Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Hoy (woe, doom) unto the foolish nevi'im, that follow their own ruach, and have seen nothing!"
Yechezkel,13,4,"O Yisroel, thy nevi'im are like the jackals among ruins."
Yechezkel,13,5,"Ye have not gone up into the peratzot (breaches) , neither repaired the wall for Bais Yisroel to stand firm in the milchamah (battle) in the Yom Hashem."
Yechezkel,13,6,"They have seen shav (vanity) and kesem kazav (lying divination) , saying, Hashem saith; and Hashem hath not sent them; yet they hope that their davar will be fulfilled."
Yechezkel,13,7,"Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a kesem kazav (lying divination) , whereas ye say, Hashem saith it; albeit I have not spoken?"
Yechezkel,13,8,"Therefore thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Because ye have spoken shav (vanity, futility) and seen kazav (lie) , therefore, hineni, I am against you, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,13,9,"And Mine yad shall be against the nevi'im that see shav (vanity, futility) , and that divine kazav (lie) : they shall not be in the sod (council) of My people, neither shall they be written in the Ketav (Register) of Bais Yisroel, neither shall they enter into Admat Yisroel; and ye shall know that I am Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,13,10,"Because, even because they have seduced My people to lead them astray, saying, Shalom; v'ein shalom; and one built up a chayitz (wall, partition, temporary wall) , and, hinei, others plastered it with [dissolving] mud-plaster."
Yechezkel,13,11,Say unto them that plaster it with mud-plaster that it shall fall: there shall be an overflowing geshem; and great hailstones shall fall; and a ruach se'arot (storm wind) shall burst forth.
Yechezkel,13,12,"Hinei, when the kir (wall) is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where is the mud-plaster wherewith ye have daubed it?"
Yechezkel,13,13,"Therefore thus saith Adonoi Hashem ; I will even cause a ruach se'arot (storm wind) in My wrath; and there shall be an overflowing geshem in Mine anger, and great hailstones in My fury to destroy."
Yechezkel,13,14,"So will I break down the kir (wall) that ye have plastered with mud-plaster, and bring it down to the ground, so that the yesod (foundation) thereof shall be laid bare, and it shall fall, and ye shall be destroyed in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I am Hashem."
Yechezkel,13,15,"Thus will I spend My chemah (wrath) upon the kir (wall) , and upon them that have plastered it with mud-plaster, and will say unto you, The kir (wall) is no more, neither they that mud-plastered it;"
Yechezkel,13,16,"Namely, the nevi'im of Yisroel which prophesy concerning Yerushalayim, and which see chazon shalom for her, v'ein shalom, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,13,17,"Likewise, thou ben adam, set thy face against the banot amecha (daughters of your people) , which prophesy out of their own lev; and prophesy thou against them,"
Yechezkel,13,18,"And say, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Hoy (woe, doom) to the seamstresses of magic charms on wrists, who make mispachot (amulets) for the rosh of every size to hunt nefashot! Will ye hunt the nefashot of My people, and yet save your own nefashot alive?"
Yechezkel,13,19,"And will ye profane Me among My people for handfuls of se'orim and for pieces of lechem, to slay the nefashot that should not die, and to save the nefashot alive that should not live, by your kazav (lying) to My people that hear your kazav?"
Yechezkel,13,20,"Therefore thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Hineni, I am against your magic charms, wherewith ye there hunt to ensnare the nefashot like birds, and I will tear them from your arms, and will let the nefashot go, even the nefashot that ye hunt like birds."
Yechezkel,13,21,"Your mispachot (amulets) also will I tear off, and I will save My people out of your yad, and they shall be no more in your yad (hand, power) to be hunted; and ye shall know that I am Hashem."
Yechezkel,13,22,"Because with sheker (falsehood) ye have made the lev tzaddik sad, to whom I have not brought sadness; and strengthened the hands of the rasha, that he should not turn from his derech harah to save his life;"
Yechezkel,13,23,"Therefore ye shall see no longer shav (vanity, futility) , nor practice divinations; for I will save My people out of your yad; and ye shall know that I am Hashem."
Yechezkel,14,1,"Then came certain anashim of the zekenim of Yisroel unto me, and sat before me."
Yechezkel,14,2,"And the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,14,3,"Ben adam, these anashim have set up their gillulim (idols) in their lev, and put the michshol (stumbling block) of their avon before their face; should I be inquired of at all by them?"
Yechezkel,14,4,"Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Every ish of Bais Yisroel that setteth up his gillulim in his lev, and putteth the michshol (stumbling block) of his avon before his face, and cometh to the navi; I Hashem will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his gillulim;"
Yechezkel,14,5,"That I may seize Bais Yisroel in their lev, who have become estranged from me, all of them, for their gillulim (idols)."
Yechezkel,14,6,"Therefore say unto Bais Yisroel, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Make teshuvah, and turn yourselves away from your gillulim (idols) ; and turn away your faces from all your to'avot (abominations)."
Yechezkel,14,7,"For every one of Bais Yisroel, or of the ger that sojourneth in Yisroel, which separateth himself from Me, and setteth up his gillulim (idols) in his lev (heart) , and putteth the michshol (stumbling block) of his avon (iniquity) before his face, and cometh to a navi (prophet) to inquire of him concerning Me; I Hashem will answer him by Myself;"
Yechezkel,14,8,"And I will set My face against that ish, and will make him an ot (sign) and for meshalim (proverbs), and I will cut him off from the midst of My people; and ye shall know that I am Hashem."
Yechezkel,14,9,"And if the navi be induced to make a pronouncement, I Hashem have induced that navi, and I will stretch out My yad against him, and will make him shmad from the midst of My people Yisroel."
Yechezkel,14,10,And they shall bear the punishment of their avon; the punishment of the navi shall be even as the punishment of him that inquireth of him;
Yechezkel,14,11,"That Bais Yisroel may go no more astray from Me, neither be made tameh any more with all their peysha'im; but that they may be My people, and I may be to them Elohim, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,14,12,"The Devar Hashem came again to me, saying,"
Yechezkel,14,13,"Ben adam, when eretz sinneth against Me by persistent ma'al (faithlessness, treachery) , then will I stretch out Mine yad upon it, and will break the matteh lechem thereof, and will send ra'av (famine) upon it, and will cut off adam and behemah from it;"
Yechezkel,14,14,"Though these three anashim — Noach, Daniel, and Iyov — were in it, they would deliver but their own nefesh by their tzedakah, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,14,15,"If I cause chayyah ra'ah (wild beasts) to pass through ha'aretz, and they bereave it of children, so that it be desolate, that no one may pass through because of the beasts;"
Yechezkel,14,16,"Though these sheloshet ha'anashim were in the midst of it, as I live, saith Adonoi Hashem , they shall deliver neither banim nor banot; only they shall be delivered, but ha'aretz shall be desolate."
Yechezkel,14,17,"Or if I bring a cherev upon that land, and say, Cherev, pass through ha'aretz; so that I cut off adam and behemah from it;"
Yechezkel,14,18,"Though these sheloshet ha'anashim were in it, as I live, saith Adonoi Hashem , they would deliver neither banim nor banot, but they only themselves would be delivered."
Yechezkel,14,19,"Or if I send a dever (plague) into that land, and pour out My chemah (fury) upon it in dahm, to cut off from it adam and behemah;"
Yechezkel,14,20,"Though Noach, Daniel, and Iyov were in it, as I live, saith Adonoi Hashem , they would deliver neither ben nor bat; they would but deliver their own nefashot by their tzedakah."
Yechezkel,14,21,"For thus saith Adonoi Hashem : How much worse will it be when I send My four severe judgments upon Yerushalayim — the cherev, and the ra'av (famine) , and the chayyah ra'ah (wild beast) , and the dever — to cut off from it adam and behemah?"
Yechezkel,14,22,"Yet, hinei, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought out, both banim and banot; behold, they shall come forth unto you, and ye shall see their derech and their doings; and ye shall be consoled concerning the ra'ah that I have brought upon Yerushalayim, even concerning all that I have brought upon it."
Yechezkel,14,23,"And they shall console you, when ye see their drakhim and their doings; and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,15,1,"And the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,15,2,"Ben adam, how is the etz hagefen (wood of the grapevine) better than any tree, or than a branch which is among the trees of the forest?"
Yechezkel,15,3,Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? Or will men take a yated (peg) of it to hang any vessel thereon?
Yechezkel,15,4,"Hinei, it is cast into the eish for fuel; the eish devoureth both the ends of it, and the middle of it is charred. Is it fit for any melachah (work)?"
Yechezkel,15,5,"Hinei, when it was tamim (whole) , it was fit for no work; how much less shall it be fit yet for any work, when the eish hath devoured it, and it is charred?"
Yechezkel,15,6,"Therefore thus saith Adonoi Hashem : As the etz hagefen among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the eish for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Yerushalayim."
Yechezkel,15,7,"And I will set My face against them; they shall go out from one eish, and another eish shall devour them; and ye shall have da'as that I am Hashem , when I set My face against them."
Yechezkel,15,8,"And I will make ha'aretz desolate, because they have committed ma'al (unfaithfulness, betrayal of a trust) , saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,16,1,"Again the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,16,2,"Ben adam, cause Yerushalayim to know her to'avot (abominations),"
Yechezkel,16,3,"And say, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem unto Yerushalayim: Thy origin and thy birth are from Eretz HaKena'ani; avicha was HaEmori (the Amorite) and your em Chittit (a Hittite)."
Yechezkel,16,4,"And as for thy moledot (birth) , in the day thou wast born thy navel cord was not cut, neither wast thou washed in mayim to cleanse thee; thou wast not salted at all, nor swaddled at all."
Yechezkel,16,5,"None eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out into the open sadeh, when thou thyself were loathed, in your yom huledet (day of birth)."
Yechezkel,16,6,"And when I passed by thee, and saw thee flailing about in thine own dahm, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy dahm, Chayi! (live!) Indeed, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy dahm, Chayi!"
Yechezkel,16,7,"I have caused thee to multiply as the tzemach of the sadeh, and thou hast increased and matured, and thou art come to excellent beauty; thy breasts are fashioned, and thine hair is grown, whereas thou wast erom (naked) and bare."
Yechezkel,16,8,"Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, hinei, thy time was the time of dodim (love) ; and I spread My kanaf (wing, corner of garment) over thee, and covered thy ervah (nakedness) ; indeed, I swore an oath unto thee, and entered into a brit with thee, saith Adonoi Hashem , and thou becamest Mine."
Yechezkel,16,9,"Then washed I thee with mayim; indeed, I thoroughly washed away thy dahm from thee, and I anointed thee with shemen."
Yechezkel,16,10,"I clothed thee also with embroidered cloth, and shod thee with tachash leather, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I covered thee with silk."
Yechezkel,16,11,"I decked thee also with jewelry, and I put tzemidim (bracelets) upon thy hands, and a necklace chain on thy neck."
Yechezkel,16,12,"And I put a nezem (ring) in thy nose, and earrings in thine oznayim, and an ateret tiferet upon thine rosh."
Yechezkel,16,13,"Thus wast thou decked with zahav and kesef; and thy raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and embroidered cloth; thou didst eat fine flour, and devash, and shemen; and thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou didst become fit for royalty."
Yechezkel,16,14,"And thy shem (name, renown) went forth among the Goyim on account of thy beauty; for it was perfect, through My hadar (splendor) which I had set upon thee, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,16,15,"But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the zonah because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy harlotry on every one that passed by; his it became."
Yechezkel,16,16,"And of thy begadim thou didst take, and adorned thy bamot te'lu'ot (gaudy high places, cult prostitution brilliantly colored harlot “beds”) , and playedst the zonah thereupon; such things should not come, neither should they be."
Yechezkel,16,17,"Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of My zahav and of My kesef, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself tzelamim (images) of zachar (male), and didst play the zonah with them,"
Yechezkel,16,18,"And tookest thy embroidered garments, and coveredst them; and thou hast set Mine shemen and Mine ketoret before them."
Yechezkel,16,19,"My lechem also which I gave thee, solet (fine flour) , and shemen, and devash, wherewith I fed thee, thou hast even set it before them for a re'ach hannichoach; and it was thus, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,16,20,"Moreover thou hast taken thy banim and thy banot, whom thou hast borne unto Me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured. Was this thy zonah harlotry not enough,"
Yechezkel,16,21,"That thou hast slaughtered My banim, and offered them to cause them to pass through the eish for them?"
Yechezkel,16,22,"And in all thine to'avot and thy zonah harlotry thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast erom (naked) and bare, and wast flailing about in thy dahm."
Yechezkel,16,23,"And it came to pass after all thy ra'ah (wickedness) — Oy, oy unto thee! saith Adonoi Hashem —"
Yechezkel,16,24,"That thou hast also built unto thee a gev (eminent place, cult prostitution shrine) , and hast made thee a ramah (platform) in every rechov (public square)."
Yechezkel,16,25,"Thou hast built thy ramah at rosh derech (crossroad) , and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred, and hast spread open thy raglayim to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy zonah harlotry."
Yechezkel,16,26,"Thou hast also played the zonah fornicator with the Mitzrayim, thy very fleshy neighbors; and hast increased thy zonah harlotry, to provoke Me to anger."
Yechezkel,16,27,"Hinei, therefore I have stretched out My yad against thee, and have diminished thine food ration, and delivered thee unto the nefesh (passionate desire) of them that hate thee, the banot Pelishtim (daughters of the Philistines) , which are ashamed of thy derech zimmah (lewd deportment)."
Yechezkel,16,28,"Thou hast played the zonah also with Ashur, because thou wast insatiable; indeed, thou hast played the zonah with them, and yet couldest not be satisfied."
Yechezkel,16,29,Thou hast moreover multiplied thy zenut to eretz Kena'an unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied therewith.
Yechezkel,16,30,"How degenerate is thine lev, saith Adonoi Hashem , seeing thou doest all these things, the work of a brazen isha zonah;"
Yechezkel,16,31,"In that thou buildest thine gev in rosh kol derech, and makest thine ramah in every rechov; and hast not been as a zonah, in that thou scornest hire;"
Yechezkel,16,32,"But as the isha (wife) the mena'efet (one that commiteth adultery) , which taketh zarim instead of her ish!"
Yechezkel,16,33,"They give nedeh (gifts) to all zonot; but thou givest thy nadan (gift) to all thy lovers, and hirest them, that they may come unto thee on every side for thy zenut."
Yechezkel,16,34,"And the opposite is in thee from other nashim in thy zonah harlotry, whereas none doth solicit thee to commit zonah harlotry: and in that thou givest an etnan (payment) , and no etnan is given unto thee, therefore thou art opposite."
Yechezkel,16,35,"Therefore, O zonah, hear the Devar Hashem."
Yechezkel,16,36,"Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Because thy passion was poured out, and thy ervah uncovered through thy zonah harlotry with thy lovers, and with all the gillulim (idols) of thy to'avot, and by the dahm of thy banim, which thou didst give unto them;"
Yechezkel,16,37,"Hineni, therefore I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all them that thou hast loved, with all them that thou hast hated; I will even gather them around about against thee, and will uncover thy ervah (nakedness) unto them, that they may see all thy ervah (nakedness, pudenda)."
Yechezkel,16,38,"And I will judge thee, as nashim that are guilty of no'afot (acts of adulteresses, breaking wedlock) and shefach dahm are judged; and I will bring dahm upon thee in chemah (wrath) and kina (jealousy)."
Yechezkel,16,39,"And I will also give thee into their yad, and they shall throw down thine gev, and shall break down thy ramot (high places, cult prostitution sites of pagan worship) ; they shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels, and leave thee erom (naked) and bare."
Yechezkel,16,40,"They shall also bring up a kahal against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and hack thee to bits with their charavot (swords)."
Yechezkel,16,41,"And they shall burn thine batim (houses) with eish, and execute shefatim (judgments) upon thee in the sight of many nashim; and I will cause thee to cease from playing the zonah, and thou also shalt give no etnan (payment) any more."
Yechezkel,16,42,"So will I make My chemah (wrath) toward thee to rest, and My kina (jealousy) shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry."
Yechezkel,16,43,"Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast provoked Me in all these things; therefore surely I also will repay thy derech upon thine rosh, saith Adonoi Hashem ; and thou shalt not commit this zimmah (lewdness) in addition to all thine to'avot."
Yechezkel,16,44,"Hinei, every one that useth proverbs shall use this mashal against thee, saying, As is the imma (mother) , so is her bat (daughter)."
Yechezkel,16,45,"Thou art bat of thy em, that despised her ish and her banim; and thou art the achot (sister) of thy akhayot, which despised their anashim and their banim; your em was a Chittit (Hittite) , and your av an Emori (Amorite)."
Yechezkel,16,46,"And thine elder achot (sister) is Shomron, she and her banot that dwell to thy north; and thy younger achot, that dwelleth to thy south, is Sodom and her banot."
Yechezkel,16,47,"Yet hast thou not walked after their drakhim, nor done after their to'avot; but, as if that were too little a thing, thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy drakhim."
Yechezkel,16,48,"As I live, saith Adonoi Hashem , Sodom thy achot (sister) hath not done, she nor her banot, as thou hast done, thou and thy banot."
Yechezkel,16,49,"Hinei, this was the avon Sodom thy achot; ga'on (pride) , over fullness of lechem, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her banot, neither did she strengthen the yad of the oni (poor) and evyon (needy)."
Yechezkel,16,50,"And they were haughty, and committed to'evah before Me; therefore I took them away as I saw."
Yechezkel,16,51,"Neither hath Shomron committed half of thy chattot (sins) ; but thou hast multiplied thine to'avot more than they, and hast made thy akhayot (sisters) seem righteous in all thine to'avot which thou hast done."
Yechezkel,16,52,"Thou also, which hast judged thy akhayot (sisters) , bear thine own shame for thy chattot (sins) that thou hast committed more abominable than theirs; they are more righteous than thou; indeed, be thou disgraced also, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast made thy akhayot (sisters) seem righteous."
Yechezkel,16,53,"When I shall restore their fortunes, the fortunes of Sodom and her banot, and the fortunes of Shomron and her banot, then will I restore the fortunes of thy fortune among them:"
Yechezkel,16,54,"That thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be disgraced in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them."
Yechezkel,16,55,"When thy akhayot (sisters) , Sodom and her banot, shall return to their former state, and Shomron and her banot shall return to their former state, then thou and thy banot shall return to your former state."
Yechezkel,16,56,"For thy achot (sister) Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy ga'on (pride),"
Yechezkel,16,57,"Before thy ra'ah (wickedness) was uncovered, as at the time of the cherpah (disgrace) of the banot Aram (Syria) , and all that are around her, the banot of the Pelishtim (Philistines) , which despise thee all around."
Yechezkel,16,58,"Thou hast borne [the penalty of] thy zimmah (lewdness) and thine to'avot, saith Hashem."
Yechezkel,16,59,"For thus saith Adonoi Hashem : I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the brit (covenant)."
Yechezkel,16,60,"Nevertheless I will remember My Brit (covenant) with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee a Brit Olam."
Yechezkel,16,61,"Then thou shalt remember thy drakhim, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy akhayot (sisters) , thine elder and thy younger; and I will give them unto thee for banot, but not because of thy brit (covenant)."
Yechezkel,16,62,And I will establish My Brit (covenant) with thee; and thou shalt know that I am Hashem;
Yechezkel,16,63,"That thou mayest remember, and be ashamed, and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I have made kapporah (atonement) toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,17,1,"And the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,17,2,"Ben adam, put forth an allegory, and speak a mashal unto the Bais Yisroel;"
Yechezkel,17,3,"And say, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : A nesher hagadol with great kenafayim (wings) , long pinions, full of plumage, which had various colors, came unto Levanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar."
Yechezkel,17,4,"He broke off its topmost young twig, and carried it into an eretz kena'an (land of trade) ; he set it in a city of merchants."
Yechezkel,17,5,"He took also of the zera of ha'aretz, and planted it in a fertile sadeh; he placed it by abundant mayim, and set it out like a willow tree."
Yechezkel,17,6,"And it yitzmach (sprouted) , and became a spreading gefen of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him; so it became a gefen (vine) , and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs."
Yechezkel,17,7,"There was also another nesher hagadol with great kenafayim (wings) and many feathers; and, hinei, this gefen (vine) did bend her roots toward him, and shot forth her branches toward him, that he might water it by the furrows where it had been planted."
Yechezkel,17,8,"It was planted in a sadeh tov by mayim rabbim, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear p'ri, that it might be a majestic gefen."
Yechezkel,17,9,"Say thou, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Shall it thrive? Shall he not pull up the shorashim (roots) thereof, and cut off the p'ri (fruit) thereof, that it wither? All of its tzemach (sprouted) leaves shall wither, even without great power or many peoples to pluck it up by the shorashim (roots) thereof."
Yechezkel,17,10,"Indeed, hinei, being transplanted, shall it thrive? Shall it not utterly wither, when the east wind toucheth it? It shall wither in the furrows where it tzemach (sprouted)."
Yechezkel,17,11,"Moreover the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,17,12,"Say now to bais hameri (the rebellious house) , Know ye not what these things mean? Tell them: Hinei, Melech Bavel is come to Yerushalayim, and hath taken HaMelech thereof, and the sarim thereof, and led them with him to Bavel;"
Yechezkel,17,13,"And hath taken of the royal zera, and cut a Brit with him, and hath taken an oath of him; he hath also taken away the mighty of ha'aretz;"
Yechezkel,17,14,"That the mamlachah (kingdom) might be abased, that it might not exalt itself, but that by being shomer over his brit it might stand."
Yechezkel,17,15,"But he rebelled against him in sending his malachim into Mitzrayim, that they might give him susim and much people. Shall he prosper? Shall he escape that doeth such things? Or shall he break the brit (covenant) , and be delivered?"
Yechezkel,17,16,"As I live, saith Adonoi Hashem , surely in the makom where the melech dwelleth that made him melech, whose oath he despised, whose brit he broke, even with him in the midst of Bavel he shall die."
Yechezkel,17,17,"Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great kahal do anything for him in the milchamah, by casting up siege mounds, and building siegework, to cut off many nefashot."
Yechezkel,17,18,"Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the brit, when, hinei, he had given his yad, and still did all these things, he shall not escape."
Yechezkel,17,19,"Therefore thus saith Adonoi Hashem ; As I live, surely Mine oath that he hath despised, and My Brit (covenant) that he hath broken, even it will I repay upon his own rosh."
Yechezkel,17,20,"And I will spread My net upon him, and he shall be caught in My snare, and I will bring him to Bavel, and will execute justice on him there for his ma'al (unfaithfulness) that he hath been unfaithful against Me."
Yechezkel,17,21,"And all his fugitives with all his troops shall fall by the cherev, and they that survive and remain shall be scattered toward kol ruach (all winds) ; and ye shall know that I Hashem have spoken it."
Yechezkel,17,22,"Thus saith Adonoi Hashem ; I will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar, and will plant it; I will break off from the top of its young twigs a tender one, and will plant it upon a high mountain and prominent;"
Yechezkel,17,23,"On the high mountain of Yisroel will I plant it; and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear p'ri (fruit) , and be a majestic cedar; and under it shall dwell kol tzippor (every bird) of every wing; in the tzel (shadow) of the branches thereof shall they dwell."
Yechezkel,17,24,"And all the trees of the sadeh shall know that I Hashem have brought down the high etz (tree) , have exalted the low etz (tree) , have dried up the green etz (tree) , and have made the etz yavesh (dry tree) to flourish. I Hashem have spoken and have done it."
Yechezkel,18,1,"The Devar Hashem came unto me again, saying,"
Yechezkel,18,2,"What mean ye, that ye use this mashal concerning Admat Yisroel, saying, Avot have eaten sour grapes, and the teeth of the banim are set on edge?"
Yechezkel,18,3,"As I live, saith Adonoi Hashem , ye shall not have occasion any more to use this mashal in Yisroel."
Yechezkel,18,4,"Behold, all nefashot are Mine; as the nefesh of the av, so also the nefesh of the ben is Mine; the nefesh that sinneth, it shall die."
Yechezkel,18,5,"But if an ish be tzaddik, and do that which is mishpat and tzedakah,"
Yechezkel,18,6,"And hath not eaten [sacrifices of gillulim, idols] upon the harim, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the gillulim of Bais Yisroel, neither hath made tameh the isha of his neighbor, neither hath come near to an isha niddah,"
Yechezkel,18,7,"And hath not oppressed any ish, but hath restored to the debtor his chavolah (pledge, collateral) , hath spoiled none by a robberʼs violence, hath given his lechem to the hungry, and hath covered the eirom (naked) with a garment;"
Yechezkel,18,8,"He that hath not loaned gelt on neshekh, neither hath taken any tarbit (interest, usury) , that hath withdrawn his yad from iniquity, hath executed mishpat emes between ish and ish,"
Yechezkel,18,9,"Hath walked in My chukkot, and hath been shomer over My mishpatim, to do emes; he is tzaddik, he shall surely live, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,18,10,"If he father a ben-paritz shofech dahm (a violent son who sheds blood) , and that doeth the like to his brother,"
Yechezkel,18,11,"Though he doeth none of these; he hath eaten [sacrifices to idols] upon the harim, and made tameh the isha of his neighbor,"
Yechezkel,18,12,"Hath oppressed the oni and evyon, hath spoiled by a robberʼs violence, hath not restored the chavol (pledge) , and hath lifted up his eyes to the gillulim, hath committed to'evah (abomination),"
Yechezkel,18,13,"Hath loaned gelt upon neshekh (usury) , and hath taken tarbit (interest) ; shall he then live? He shall not live; he hath done all these to'evot; he shall surely die; his dahm shall be upon him."
Yechezkel,18,14,"Now, hinei, if he father a ben, that seeth all the chattot aviv which he hath done, and considereth, and doeth not like such,"
Yechezkel,18,15,"That hath not eaten [sacrifices to idols] upon the harim, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the gillulim of Bais Yisroel, hath not made tameh the isha of his neighbor,"
Yechezkel,18,16,"Neither hath oppressed any ish, hath not withheld the chavol (pledge) , neither hath spoiled by a robberʼs violence, but hath given his lechem to the hungry, and hath covered the eirom (naked) with a garment,"
Yechezkel,18,17,"That hath taken off his yad from the oni, that hath not received neshekh (usury) nor tarbit (interest) , hath executed My mishpat, hath walked in My chukkot; he shall not die for the avon aviv, he shall surely live."
Yechezkel,18,18,"As for aviv, because he cruelly oppressed with extortion, spoiled his brother by a robberʼs violence, and did that which is not tov among his people, hinei, even he shall die in his avon."
Yechezkel,18,19,"Yet say ye, Why? Doth not the ben bear the avon (iniquity, guilt) of the av? When the ben hath done that which is mishpat and tzedakah, and hath been shomer over all My chukkot, and hath done them, he shall surely live."
Yechezkel,18,20,"The nefesh that sinneth, it shall die. The ben shall not nasah the avon of the av, neither shall the av nasah the avon of the ben; the tzedakat hatzaddik shall be upon him, and the rishat rashah shall be upon him."
Yechezkel,18,21,"But if the rashah will turn from all his chattot that he hath committed, and be shomer over all My chukkot, and do that which is mishpat and tzedakah, he shall surely live, he shall not die."
Yechezkel,18,22,"All his peysha'im that he hath committed, they shall not be remembered against him: in his tzidkat that he hath done he shall live."
Yechezkel,18,23,"Have I any pleasure at all in the mot rashah? saith Adonoi Hashem . And not that he should make teshuvah from the darkhei of him, and live?"
Yechezkel,18,24,"But when the tzaddik turneth away from his tzedek, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the to'evot that the rashah doeth, shall he live? All his tzedek that he hath done shall not be remembered; in his ma'al (unfaithfulness) that he hath committed treachery, and in his chattat that he hath sinned, in them shall he die."
Yechezkel,18,25,"Yet ye say, The Derech Adonoi is not proper. Hear now, O Bais Yisroel: Is My Derech not proper? Is it not the drakhim of you that are not proper?"
Yechezkel,18,26,"When a tzaddik turneth away from his tzedek, and committeth iniquity, and dieth in them, for his iniquity that he hath done shall he die."
Yechezkel,18,27,"Again, when a rashah turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is mishpat and tzedakah, he shall save his nefesh alive."
Yechezkel,18,28,"Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his peysha'im that he hath committed, he shall surely live; he shall not die."
Yechezkel,18,29,"Yet saith Bais Yisroel, The Derech Adonoi is not proper. O Bais Yisroel, is My Derech not proper? Is it not the drakhim of you that are not proper?"
Yechezkel,18,30,"Therefore I will judge you, O Bais Yisroel, every one according to the drakhim of him, saith Adonoi Hashem . Make teshuvah, and turn yourselves from all your peysha'im, so avon shall not be your michshol (stumbling block, downfall)."
Yechezkel,18,31,"Cast away from you all your peysha'im, whereby ye have committed peysha; and get you a lev chadash and a ruach chadashah; for why will ye die, O Bais Yisroel?"
Yechezkel,18,32,"For I have no pleasure in the mot of him that dieth, saith Adonoi Hashem ; therefore, make teshuva and live!"
Yechezkel,19,1,"Moreover take thou up a kinah (lament) for the nasi'im of Yisroel,"
Yechezkel,19,2,"And say, What is immecha, a lioness? She lay down among arayot (lions) , rearing her cubs among young lions."
Yechezkel,19,3,"And she brought up one of her cubs; it became a strong lion, and it learned to tear teref (prey) ; it devoured adam."
Yechezkel,19,4,"The Goyim also heard of him; he was trapped in their shachat (pit) , and they brought him with hooks unto Eretz Mitzrayim."
Yechezkel,19,5,"Now when she saw that in vain she had waited, and her tikvah (hope) was lost, then she took another of her cubs, and made him a strong lion."
Yechezkel,19,6,"And he went up and down among the arayot (lions) , he became a strong lion, and learned to tear the teref, and devoured adam."
Yechezkel,19,7,"And he destroyed their strongholds, and he laid waste their towns; and eretz and the fulness thereof became desolate, through the sound of his roaring."
Yechezkel,19,8,"Then the Goyim set against him on every side from the medinot (provinces) , and spread their reshet (net) over him; he was trapped in their shachat (pit)."
Yechezkel,19,9,"And they put him in a neckstock with hooks, and brought him to Melech Bavel; they brought him into metzodot (fortresses) , that his voice should no more be heard upon the harim of Yisroel."
Yechezkel,19,10,"Immecha is like a gefen (vine) full of shoots, planted by the mayim; she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of mayim rabbim."
Yechezkel,19,11,"And she had strong branches that became the shivtei moshlim (scepters of rulers) , and her stature towered above the thick branches, and she was seen in her height amid the dense branches."
Yechezkel,19,12,"But she was uprooted in chemah (fury) , she was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up her p'ri; her strong branches were broken and withered; the eish consumed them."
Yechezkel,19,13,"And now she is planted in the midbar, in a dry and thirsty eretz."
Yechezkel,19,14,"And eish is gone out of a rod of her branches, which hath devoured her p'ri, so that she hath no strong branch to be a shevet (sceptre) to rule. This is a kinah lament, and shall be for a funeral dirge."
Yechezkel,20,1,"And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month, that certain anashim of the zekenim of Yisroel came to inquire of Hashem , and sat before me."
Yechezkel,20,2,"Then came the Devar Hashem unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,20,3,"Ben adam, speak unto the zekenim of Yisroel, and say unto them, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Are ye come to inquire of Me? As I live, saith Adonoi Hashem , I will not be inquired of by you."
Yechezkel,20,4,"Wilt thou judge them, ben adam, wilt thou judge them? Cause them to know the to'avot of their avot."
Yechezkel,20,5,"And say unto them, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : In the day when I chose Yisroel, and lifted up Mine yad unto the zera Bais Ya'akov, and made Myself known unto them in Eretz Mitzrayim, when I lifted up Mine yad unto them, saying, I am Hashem Eloheichem;"
Yechezkel,20,6,"In the day that I lifted up Mine yad unto them, to bring them forth from Eretz Mitzrayim into a land that I had searched out for them, zavat cholov udevash, which is the most beautiful of all lands;"
Yechezkel,20,7,"Then said I unto them, Cast ye away every ish the shikkutzim before his eynayim, and make not yourselves tameh with the gillulim (idols) of Mitzrayim; I am Hashem Eloheichem."
Yechezkel,20,8,"But they rebelled against Me, and would not pay heed unto Me; they did not every ish cast away the shikkutzim from before their eynayim, neither did they forsake the gillulim (idols) of Mitzrayim; then I said, I will pour out My chemah (wrath) upon them, to vent My anger against them in the midst of Eretz Mitzrayim."
Yechezkel,20,9,"But I acted for My Nameʼs sake, that it should not be profaned before the eyes of the Goyim, among whom they were living. In bringing them forth out of Eretz Mitzrayim, in their sight I made Myself [publicly] known unto them."
Yechezkel,20,10,"Therefore I caused them to go forth out of Eretz Mitzrayim, and brought them into the midbar."
Yechezkel,20,11,"And I gave them My chukkot, and made known to them My mishpatim, which if ha'adam does, he shall even live in them."
Yechezkel,20,12,"Moreover also I gave them My Shabbatot, to be an Ot between Me and them, that they might know that I am Hashem that set them apart as kodesh."
Yechezkel,20,13,"But Bais Yisroel rebelled against Me in the midbar; they walked not in My chukkot, and they despised My mishpatim, which if ha'adam does, he shall even live in them; and My Shabbatot they greatly defiled; then I said, I would pour out My chemah (wrath) upon them in the midbar, to consume them."
Yechezkel,20,14,"But I acted for My Nameʼs sake, that it should not be profaned before the eyes of the Goyim, in whose sight I brought them out."
Yechezkel,20,15,"Yet also I lifted up My Yad unto them in the midbar, that I would not bring them into ha'aretz which I had given them, zavat cholov udevash, the most beautiful of all lands;"
Yechezkel,20,16,"Because they despised My mishpatim, and walked not in My chukkot, but profaned My Shabbatot; for their lev went after their gillulim (idols)."
Yechezkel,20,17,"Nevertheless since Mine eye spared them from destroying them, I did not make an end of them in the midbar."
Yechezkel,20,18,"But I said unto their banim in the midbar, Walk ye not in the chukkot of avoteichem, neither be shomer over their mishpatim, nor make yourselves tameh with their gillulim (idols)."
Yechezkel,20,19,"I am Hashem Eloheichem; walk in My chukkot, and be shomer over My mishpatim, and do them;"
Yechezkel,20,20,"And be shomer shabbos over My Shabbatot, keeping them kodesh; and they shall be an Ot between Me and you, that ye may know that I am Hashem Eloheichem."
Yechezkel,20,21,"Notwithstanding, the banim rebelled against Me; they walked not in My chukkot, neither were shomer over My mishpatim to do them, which if ha'adam does, he shall even live in them; they profaned My Shabbatot; then I said, I would pour out My chemah (wrath) upon them, to accomplish My anger against them in the midbar."
Yechezkel,20,22,"Nevertheless, I withdrew Mine yad, and acted for My Nameʼs sake, that it should not be profaned before the eyes of the Goyim, in whose sight I brought them forth."
Yechezkel,20,23,"I lifted up Mine yad unto them also in the midbar, that I would scatter them among the Goyim, and disperse them through the countries;"
Yechezkel,20,24,"Because they had not executed My mishpatim, but had despised My chukkot, and had profaned My Shabbatot, and their eynayim were after the gillulim of their fathers."
Yechezkel,20,25,"Therefore I gave them also chukkot that were not tovim, and mishpatim whereby they could not live;"
Yechezkel,20,26,"And I pronounced them tameh (unclean) because of their own [ritual] gifts, in that they caused to pass through the eish all that openeth the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am Hashem."
Yechezkel,20,27,"Therefore, ben adam, speak unto Bais Yisroel, and say unto them, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Yet in this avoteichem have made gidduf (blasphemy) against Me, in that they have been ma'al (unfaithful) to Me."
Yechezkel,20,28,"For when I had brought them into ha'aretz, for the which I lifted up Mine yad to give it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered there their zevakhim, and there they presented the ka'as (provocation) of their korban; there also they made their re'ach hannichoach, and poured out there their nesakhim."
Yechezkel,20,29,"Then I said unto them, What is the bamah whereunto ye go? And the shem whereof is called Bamah (High Place) unto this day."
Yechezkel,20,30,"Therefore say unto Bais Yisroel, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Are ye ones making yourself tameh after the manner of avoteichem? And do ye commit zenut after their shikkutzim?"
Yechezkel,20,31,"For when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your banim to pass through the eish, ye make yourselves tameh with all your gillulim (idols) , even unto this day; and shall I be inquired of by you, O Bais Yisroel? As I live, saith Adonoi Hashem , I will not be inquired of by you."
Yechezkel,20,32,"And that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all — that ye say, We will be as the Goyim, as the mishpekhot of the countries, to serve wood and even (stone)."
Yechezkel,20,33,"As I live, saith Adonoi Hashem , surely with a yad chazakah, and with an outstretched zero'a, and with chemah (fury) poured out, will I rule over you;"
Yechezkel,20,34,"And I will bring you out from the peoples, and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a yad chazakah, and with an outstretched zero'a, and with chemah (wrath) poured out."
Yechezkel,20,35,"And I will bring you into the midbar of the peoples, and there will I execute judgment with you face to face."
Yechezkel,20,36,"Just as I judged avoteichem in the midbar of the Eretz Mitzrayim, so will I enter into judgment with you, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,20,37,"And I will cause you to pass under the shevet (rod) , and I will bring you into the bond of the brit (covenant);"
Yechezkel,20,38,"And I will purge out from among you the rebels and the posh'im against Me; I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn as gerim, and they shall not enter into Eretz Yisroel; and ye shall know that I am Hashem."
Yechezkel,20,39,"As for you, O Bais Yisroel, thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Go ye, serve ye every one his gillulim, and hereafter since ye will not pay heed unto Me; and do not profane Shem Kodshi anymore with your gifts, and with your gillulim."
Yechezkel,20,40,"For in Har Kodshi, in the mountain of the height of Yisroel, saith Adonoi Hashem , there shall all Bais Yisroel, all of them in ha'aretz, serve Me; there will I accept them, there will I require your terumot, the reshit of your offerings, with all your kodeshim."
Yechezkel,20,41,"I will accept you as a re'ach hannichoach, when I bring you out from the peoples, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered; and I will show Myself Kadosh among you before the eyes of the Goyim."
Yechezkel,20,42,"And ye shall know that I am Hashem , when I shall bring you into Admat Yisroel, into the country for which I lifted up Mine yad to give it to avoteichem."
Yechezkel,20,43,"And there shall ye remember your drakhim, and all your doings, wherein ye have made yourselves tameh; and ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed."
Yechezkel,20,44,"And ye shall know that I am Hashem when I have dealt with you for the sake of Shmi, not according to your wicked drakhim, nor according to your corrupt doings, O ye Bais Yisroel, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,20,45,"Moreover the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,20,46,"Ben adam, set thy face toward the south, and preach against the south, and prophesy against the forest land of the Negev;"
Yechezkel,20,47,"And say to the forest of the Negev, Hear the Devar Hashem : Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Hineni, I will kindle an eish in thee, and it shall devour every green etz (tree) in thee, and every dry etz (tree) ; the blazing flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the Negev to the north shall be scorched by it."
Yechezkel,20,48,And all basar shall see that I Hashem have kindled it; it shall not be quenched.
Yechezkel,20,49,"Then said I, Ah Adonoi Hashem ! They say of me, Doth he not speak meshalim (parables)?"
Yechezkel,21,1,"And the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,21,2,"Ben adam, set thy face toward Yerushalayim, and preach against the mikdashim, and prophesy against Admat Yisroel,"
Yechezkel,21,3,"And say to Admat Yisroel, Thus saith Hashem : Hineni, I am against thee, will draw forth My cherev out of its sheath, will cut off from thee the tzaddik and the rasha."
Yechezkel,21,4,"Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the tzaddik and the rasha, therefore shall My cherev go forth out of its sheath against kol basar from the Negev to the tzafon (north);"
Yechezkel,21,5,That kol basar may know that I Hashem have drawn forth My cherev out of its sheath; it shall not return any more.
Yechezkel,21,6,"Sigh therefore, thou ben adam, with a breaking heart; and with bitterness groan before their eynayim."
Yechezkel,21,7,"And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Why sighest thou? That thou shalt answer, For the news; because it cometh; and every lev shall melt, and all hands shall go limp with fear, and every ruach shall faint, and all birkayim (knees) shall be weak as mayim; hinei, it cometh, and shall be brought to pass, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,21,8,"Again the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,21,9,"Ben adam, prophesy, and say, Thus saith Adonoi: Say, A cherev, a cherev is sharpened, and also polished;"
Yechezkel,21,10,It is sharpened to make a dreadful tevo'ach; it is polished and lightening-like it flashes; should we then make mirth? The Shevet of Beni will despise kol etz (every tree).
Yechezkel,21,11,"And it is given to be polished, that it may be grasped with the palm; this cherev is sharpened, and it is polished, to deliver it into the yad of the slayer."
Yechezkel,21,12,"Cry and wail, ben adam; for it shall be upon My people, it shall be upon all the nasi'im of Yisroel; including terrors by reason of the cherev shall be upon My people; strike therefore upon thy thigh."
Yechezkel,21,13,"Because it is a testing, and what? Even if the despising Scepter shall be no more? saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,21,14,"Thou therefore, ben adam, prophesy, and strike thine hands together, and let the cherev do double damage the third time, the cherev of the slain; it is the cherev for great slaughter — it surrounds them."
Yechezkel,21,15,"I have set the point of the cherev against all their she'arim, that their lev may faint, and many may stumble. Ah! It is made for flashing, it is wrapped for slaughter."
Yechezkel,21,16,"Go thee one way or the other, either on right hand, or on left, wherever thy face is appointed."
Yechezkel,21,17,"I will also strike Mine palm together, and I will appease My chemah (wrath) . I Hashem have said it."
Yechezkel,21,18,"The Devar Hashem came unto me again, saying,"
Yechezkel,21,19,"Also, thou, ben adam, appoint thee two drakhim, that the cherev of Melech Bavel may come; both two shall come forth out of one land; and make a sign, put it at the rosh derech (crossroads) to the Ir."
Yechezkel,21,20,"Appoint a derech, that the cherev may come to Rabbah Bnei Ammon, and to Yehudah in fortified Yerushalayim."
Yechezkel,21,21,"For Melech Bavel stood at the fork in the derech, at the rosh of the two drakhim, to use divination; he shook his khitzim (arrows) , he consulted with teraphim, he looked in the liver."
Yechezkel,21,22,"At his right hand was the kesem (divination) for Yerushalayim, to set up battering rams, to call for a slaughter, to lift up the voice with teru'ah (shouting) , to appoint battering rams against the she'arim, to heap up a siege mound, and to build a siege work."
Yechezkel,21,23,"And it shall be unto them as a kesem shav (false divination) in their sight, to them that have sworn shevu'ot (oaths) ; but he will call to remembrance the avon, that they may be seized."
Yechezkel,21,24,"Therefore thus saith Adonoi Hashem ; Because ye have made your avon to be remembered, in that your peysha'im are uncovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because, that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be captured with the palm."
Yechezkel,21,25,"And thou, profane wicked nasi of Yisroel, whose day is come, when avon shall have an end,"
Yechezkel,21,26,"Thus saith Adonoi Hashem ; Remove the mitznefet (turban) , and take off the ateret; nothing shall be the same; exalt him that is low, and abase him that is exalted."
Yechezkel,21,27,"I will make it overthrown, overthrown, overthrown: and it shall be no longer, ad bo asher lo hamishpat (until He come to whom the right it is) ; and I will give it him."
Yechezkel,21,28,"And thou, ben adam, prophesy and say, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem concerning Bnei Ammon, and concerning their cherpah; even say thou: The cherev, the cherev is drawn; for the slaughter it is polished, to consume like lightning;"
Yechezkel,21,29,"While they see chazon shav (vain visions) for thee, while they divine a kazav (lie) unto thee, to bring thee upon the tzavarot (necks) of them that are slain, of the resha'im, whose day is come, when their avon shall have an end."
Yechezkel,21,30,"Shall I cause it to return into its sheath? I will judge thee in the makom where thou wast created, in thine eretz moledet."
Yechezkel,21,31,"And I will pour out Mine za'am (indignation) upon thee, I will blow against thee in the eish of My wrath, and deliver thee into the yad of brutal anashim, skillful in destruction."
Yechezkel,21,32,Thou shalt be for fuel to the eish; thy dahm shall be in the midst of ha'aretz; thou shalt be no more remembered; for I Hashem have spoken it.
Yechezkel,22,1,"Moreover the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,22,2,"Now, thou ben adam, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the ir hadamim (bloody city) ? V'hoda'tah (thou shalt show, make to know, arraign) her all her to'avot (abominations)."
Yechezkel,22,3,"Then say thou, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem , The Ir has shefach dahm in the midst of it, that her time may come, and maketh gillulim (idols) against herself to make herself tameh (unclean)."
Yechezkel,22,4,"Thou art become guilty by thy shefach dahm; and hast made thyself tameh in thine gillulim (idols) which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come even unto thy shanot (years) ; therefore have I made thee a cherpah unto the Goyim, and a kallasa (mockery, laughingstock) to all countries."
Yechezkel,22,5,"Those that be near, and those that be far from thee, shall mock at thee, which art tameh hashem (defiled, unclean of name, reputation) and much in turmoil."
Yechezkel,22,6,"Hinei, the nasi'im (rulers) of Yisroel, every one has used his zero'a (arm, power) for shefach dahm in thee."
Yechezkel,22,7,"In thee have they treated with contempt av and em in the midst of thee; they have dealt by oshek (oppression) with the ger (alien, proselyte) ; in thee have they mistreated the yatom and the almanah."
Yechezkel,22,8,"Thou hast despised Mine kadoshim, and hast profaned My Shabbatot."
Yechezkel,22,9,In thee are anashim that slander to cause shefach dahm; and in thee are they who eat upon the harim; in the midst of thee they commit zimmah (lewdness).
Yechezkel,22,10,"In thee have they uncovered the ervat av (nakedness of their father), in thee have they raped her that had the teme'at haniddah (the uncleanness of the menstruation period)."
Yechezkel,22,11,"And ish hath committed to'evah with his neighborʼs isha; and another hath lewdly made tameh his kallah (daughter-in-law) ; and another in thee hath raped his achot, his bat aviv."
Yechezkel,22,12,"In thee have they taken shochad (bribe) for shefach dahm; thou hast taken neshekh (usury) and tarbit (interest) , and thou hast unjustly profited from thy neighbors by oshek (opression, extortion) , and hast forgotten Me, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,22,13,"Hinei, therefore I have struck Mine palm at thy betza (dishonest gain) which thou hast made, and at thy bloodshed which hath been in the midst of thee."
Yechezkel,22,14,"Can thine lev stand firm, or can thine hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee? I Hashem have spoken it, and will do it."
Yechezkel,22,15,"And I will scatter thee among the Goyim, and disperse thee throughout the countries, and will remove thy tum'a (uncleanness) out of thee."
Yechezkel,22,16,"And thou shalt defile thyself in the sight of the Goyim, and thou shalt know that I am Hashem."
Yechezkel,22,17,"And the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,22,18,"Ben adam, Bais Yisroel is to Me become sig (dross, smelting waste product) ; all they are nechoshet, and bedil (tin) , and barzel (iron) , and oferet (lead) , in the midst of the kur (furnace) ; they are even the siggim (drosses) of kesef."
Yechezkel,22,19,"Therefore thus saith Adonoi Hashem ; because ye are all become siggim, hineni, therefore I will gather you into the midst of Yerushalayim."
Yechezkel,22,20,"As they gather kesef, and nechoshet, and barzel (iron) , and oferet (lead) , and bedil (tin) , into the midst of the kur (furnace) , to blow the eish upon the ore to melt it down; so will I gather you in Mine af (anger) and in My chemah (wrath) , and I will position you there, and melt you down."
Yechezkel,22,21,"Indeed, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the eish of My evrah (wrath) , and ye shall be melted down in the midst therof."
Yechezkel,22,22,"As kesef is melted down in the midst of the kur (furnace) , so shall ye be melted down in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I Hashem have poured out My chemah (wrath) upon you."
Yechezkel,22,23,"And the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,22,24,"Ben adam, say unto her, Thou art eretz that is not metoharah (cleansed) , nor rained upon in the Yom Za'am (Day of Indignation)."
Yechezkel,22,25,"There is a kesher of her nevi'im in the midst thereof, like a roaring ari (lion) tearing the prey; they have devoured nefesh; they have taken the khosen (treasure, wealth) and precious things; they have made her many almanot (widows) in the midst thereof."
Yechezkel,22,26,"Her kohanim have done violence to My torah, and have profaned Mine kadoshim; they have put no difference between the kodesh and chol (common, profane) , neither have they made a distinction between the tameh and the tahor, and have hid their eynayim from My Shabbatot, and I am profaned among them."
Yechezkel,22,27,"Her sarim in the midst thereof are like ze'evim (wolves) tearing the prey, to do shefach dahm, and to destroy nefashot, to get betza (dishonest gain)."
Yechezkel,22,28,"And her nevi'im have plastered them with [dissolving] mud plaster, seeing vain visions, and divining kazav (lies) unto them, saying, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem , when Hashem hath not spoken."
Yechezkel,22,29,"The am ha'aretz have used oshek (oppression, extortion) and committed gazel (robbery) , and have mistreated the oni and evyon; indeed, they have treated the ger without mishpat (justice)."
Yechezkel,22,30,"And I sought for an ish among them, that should repair the gader (fence) , and stand in the peretz (gap, breach) before Me on behalf of ha'aretz, that it might not be destroyed; but I found none."
Yechezkel,22,31,"Therefore have I poured out Mine za'am (indignation, rage) upon them; I have consumed them with the eish of My evrah (wrath) ; their own derech have I brought back upon their rosh, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,23,1,"The Davar Hashem came again unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,23,2,"Ben adam, there were two nashim, the banot of one em;"
Yechezkel,23,3,"And they committed zonah harlotry in Mitzrayim; they committed zonah harlotry in their youth; there were their breasts pressed, and there their betulah bosom was caressed."
Yechezkel,23,4,"And the shmot of them were Oholah the elder, and Oholivah her achot; and they were Mine, and they bore banim and banot. Thus were their shmot: Shomron is Oholah, and Yerushalayim Oholivah."
Yechezkel,23,5,"And Oholah (unfaithful to Me) played the zonah when she was Mine; and she lusted for her lovers, for Ashur warriors,"
Yechezkel,23,6,"Which were clothed with royal blue, pachot (governors) and seganim (officials) , all of them desirable bochurim, parashim (charioteers) driving susim."
Yechezkel,23,7,"Thus she committed her zonah harlotry with them, with all them that were the choice Bnei Ashur, and with all for whom she lusted; with all their gillulim (idols) she made herself tameh."
Yechezkel,23,8,"Neither did she give up her zonah harlotry brought from Mitzrayim; for in her youth they lay with her, and they caressed her betulah bosom, and poured out their zenut fornication upon her."
Yechezkel,23,9,"Therefore I have delivered her into the yad of her lovers, into the yad of the Bnei Ashur, upon whom she lusted."
Yechezkel,23,10,"These uncovered her ervah (nakedness) ; they took her banim and her banot, and slaughtered her with the cherev; and she became a shem (byword) among nashim; for they had executed judgments upon her."
Yechezkel,23,11,"And when her achot Oholivah saw this, she was more depraved in her craving than she, her zonah harlotry became worse than the zonah harlotry of her achot."
Yechezkel,23,12,"She lusted after the Bnei Ashur warriors, pachot and seganim, clothed most gorgeously, parashim driving susim, all of them desirable bochurim."
Yechezkel,23,13,"Then I saw that she had made herself tameh, that both of them had gone derech echad (the same road)."
Yechezkel,23,14,"And that she increased her zonah harlotry; for when she saw anashim portrayed upon the kir (wall) , the tzelamim (idol images) of the Kasdim (Chaldeans) portrayed in bright red,"
Yechezkel,23,15,"Girded with ezor (belts) upon their waists, with flowing tevulim (turbans) upon their heads, all of them shalishim (ranking officers) to look to, after the demut (appearance) of those of Bnei Bavel Kasdim, their eretz moledet;"
Yechezkel,23,16,"And as soon as she saw them with her eynayim, she lusted upon them, and sent malachim unto them into Chaldea."
Yechezkel,23,17,"And the Bnei Bavel came to her into the mishkav dodim (bed of love) , and they made her tameh with their zenut (whoredom) , and she was defiled by them, and her nefesh turned away from them in disgust."
Yechezkel,23,18,"So she uncovered her zonah harlotry, and uncovered her ervah: then My Nefesh was alienated from her, just as My Nefesh was alienated from her achot."
Yechezkel,23,19,"Yet she multiplied her zonah harlotry, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the zonah in Eretz Mitzrayim."
Yechezkel,23,20,"For she lusted upon their pilagshim (illicit lovers) , whose basar is as the basar of chamorim, and whose issue is like the issue of susim."
Yechezkel,23,21,"Thus thou calledst to remembrance the zimmah (lewdness) of thy youth, when those of Mitzrayim caressed thy bosom because of thy youthful bosom."
Yechezkel,23,22,"Therefore, O Oholivah, thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Hineni, I will stir up thy lovers against thee, from whom thou hast alienated thy nefesh, and I will bring them against thee on every side;"
Yechezkel,23,23,"The Bnei Bavel, and all the Kasdim, Pekod, Shoa, Koa, and all the Bnei Ashur with them; all of them desirable bochurim, pachot and seganim, shalishim and renowned, all of them riding upon susim."
Yechezkel,23,24,"And they shall come against thee with weapons, wheeled chariots, and with a kahal amim, which shall set against thee shield and mogen and kova (helmet) all around; they will array themselves against thee; and I will delegate mishpat to them, and they shall judge thee according to their mishpatim."
Yechezkel,23,25,"And I will set My kina (jealousy) against thee, and they shall deal in chemah (wrath) with thee; they shall cut off thy nose and thine oznayim; and thy remnant shall fall by the cherev; they shall take thy banim and thy banot; and thy remnant shall be devoured by the eish."
Yechezkel,23,26,"They shall also strip thee out of thy begadim, and take away thy beautiful jewels."
Yechezkel,23,27,"Thus will I make thy zimmah (lewdness) to cease from thee, and thy zenut brought from Eretz Mitzrayim; so that thou shalt not lift up thine eynayim unto them, nor remember Mitzrayim any more."
Yechezkel,23,28,"For thus saith Adonoi Hashem ; Hineni, I will deliver thee into the yad of them whom thou hatest, into the yad of them from whom thy nefesh is alienated;"
Yechezkel,23,29,"And they shall deal with thee b'sinah (in hatred) , and shall take away all thou hast labored for, and shall leave thee erom (naked) and bare; and the ervah of thy zonah harlotry shall be uncovered, both thy zimmah (lewdness) and thy zonah harlotry."
Yechezkel,23,30,"I will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a-whoring after the Goyim, and because thou art made tameh with their gillulim."
Yechezkel,23,31,Thou hast walked in the derech of thy achot; so will I give her kos into thine yad.
Yechezkel,23,32,"Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Thou shalt drink of thy achotʼs kos deep and wide; thou shalt be laughed to scorn and held in derision; it containeth so much, filled to the brim."
Yechezkel,23,33,"Thou shalt be filled with shikkaron (drunkenness) and sorrow, with the kos of horror and desolation, with the kos of thy achot Shomron."
Yechezkel,23,34,"Thou shalt even drink it and drain it dry, and thou shalt break it into shards, and tear at thine own breasts; for I have spoken it, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,23,35,"Therefore thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Because thou hast forgotten Me, and thrust Me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy zimmah and thy zonah harlotry."
Yechezkel,23,36," Hashem said moreover unto me: Ben adam, wilt thou judge Oholah and Oholivah? Indeed, declare unto them their to'avot;"
Yechezkel,23,37,"That they have committed ni'uf, and dahm is on their hands, and with their gillulim (idols) have they committed ni'uf, and have also caused their banim, whom they bore unto Me, to pass for them through the eish, offering them as [sacrificial] food."
Yechezkel,23,38,"Moreover this they have done unto Me: they have defiled My Mikdash in the same day, and have profaned My Shabbatot."
Yechezkel,23,39,"For when they had slaughtered their banim to their gillulim (idols) , then they came the same day, entering into My Mikdash to profane it; and, hinei, thus have they done in the midst of Mine Bais."
Yechezkel,23,40,"And furthermore, they sent for anashim to come from afar, unto whom malach (messenger) had been sent; and, hinei, they came; the men for whom thou didst wash thyself, didst paint thy eynayim, and didst deck thyself with jewelry,"
Yechezkel,23,41,"And satest upon a glorious mittah (couch) , and a shulchan spread before it, whereupon thou hast set Mine ketoret and Mine shemen."
Yechezkel,23,42,"And a voice of a carefree multitude was with her; and with the anashim of the common rabble were brought drunkards from the midbar, which put bracelets upon their hands, and ateret tiferet (beautiful crowns) upon their heads."
Yechezkel,23,43,"Then said I unto her that was old in niufim (adulteries) , Will they now commit zonah harlotry with her, and she with them?"
Yechezkel,23,44,"Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto an isha that playeth the zonah; so went they in unto Oholah and unto Oholivah, the women of zimmah (lewdness)."
Yechezkel,23,45,"And the anashim tzaddikim, they shall judge them after the mishpat of no'afot (adulteresses) , and after the mishpat of those guilty of shefach dahm; because they are no'afot (adulteresses) , and dahm is on their hands."
Yechezkel,23,46,"For thus saith Adonoi Hashem : I will bring up a kahal upon them, and will give them over to be terrorized and plundered."
Yechezkel,23,47,"And the kahal shall stone them with stones, and cut them down with their charavot (swords) ; they shall slay their banim and their banot, and burn up their batim (houses) with eish."
Yechezkel,23,48,"Thus will I cause zimmah (lewdness) to cease out of ha'aretz, that all nashim may be warned not to practice your zimmah (lewdness)."
Yechezkel,23,49,"And they shall bring your zimmah (lewdness) upon you, and ye shall bear sins of your gillulim (idols) ; and ye shall know that I am Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,24,1,"Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,24,2,"Ben adam, write thee the shem of the day, even of this very day; Melech Bavel laid his siege against Yerushalayim this very day."
Yechezkel,24,3,"And utter a mashal unto the bais hameri (the rebellious house) , and say unto them, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem ; Set on the siyr (cooking pot) , set it on, and also pour mayim into it;"
Yechezkel,24,4,"Gather the pieces of meat thereof into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice atzmot (bones)."
Yechezkel,24,5,"Take the choice of the tzon, and arrange also the atzmot at its bottom, and make it boil well, and let them cook the atzmot of it therein."
Yechezkel,24,6,"Therefore thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Oy to the ir hadamim (bloody city) , to the siyr (pot) whose scum is therein, and whose scum has not been removed from it! Remove it piece by piece; no goral has fallen on it."
Yechezkel,24,7,"For her dahm is in the midst of her; she set it upon an exposed rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with aphar;"
Yechezkel,24,8,"That it might cause chemah (fury) to come up to take vengeance; I have set her dahm upon the exposed rock, that it should not be covered."
Yechezkel,24,9,Therefore thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Oy to the ir hadamim (bloody city) ! I will even make the pyre great.
Yechezkel,24,10,"Heap on wood, kindle the eish, cook the basar, and spice it well, and let the atzmot be burned."
Yechezkel,24,11,"Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the nechoshet of it may be hot, and may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be melted in it, that the scum of it may be consumed."
Yechezkel,24,12,"All efforts are wearied, [scum] is not removed, and her great scum went not forth out of her; in the eish shall be her scum."
Yechezkel,24,13,"In thy tum'a is zimmah; because I have made thee tahor, and thou wast not tahor, thou shalt not be made tahor from thy tum'a any more, until I have caused My chemah (fury, wrath) to subside upon thee."
Yechezkel,24,14,"I Hashem have spoken it; it shall come to pass, and I will do it; I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I relent: according to thy drakhim, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,24,15,"Also the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,24,16,"Ben adam, hineni, I take away from thee the makhmad (darling delight) of thine eynayim with a magefah (stroke) ; yet neither shalt thou wail nor weep, neither shall thy dema'ot (tears) run down."
Yechezkel,24,17,"Forbear to cry, make no evel (mourning) for the mesim (dead ones) ; bind the turban of thine rosh upon thee, and put thy sandals upon thy feet, and cover not thy safam (mustache) , and eat not lechem anashim (bread of sorrow)."
Yechezkel,24,18,"So I spoke unto HaAm (the people) in the boker (morning) ; and at erev (evening) my isha (wife) died; and I did in the boker (morning), just as I was commanded."
Yechezkel,24,19,"And haam (the people) said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us, that thou art so doing?"
Yechezkel,24,20,"Then I answered them. The Devar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,24,21,"Speak unto Bais Yisroel, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Hineni, I will desecrate My Mikdash, the ga'on (pride) of your power, the makhmad of your eynayim, and the very passion of your nefesh; and your banim and your banot whom ye have left behind shall fall by the cherev."
Yechezkel,24,22,"And ye shall do just as I have done: ye shall not cover your safam (mustache) , nor eat lechem anashim."
Yechezkel,24,23,"And your turbans shall be upon your heads, and your sandals upon your feet; ye shall not wail nor weep; but ye shall waste away for your avonot, and groan one toward another."
Yechezkel,24,24,"Thus Yechezkel is unto you as a mofet; according to all that he hath done shall ye do; and when this cometh, ye shall know that I am Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,24,25,"Also, thou ben adam, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their ma'oz (stronghold) , the joy of their tiferet (glory) , the makhmad (desire) of their eynayim, and that on which their nefesh is uplifted — even their banim and their banot,"
Yechezkel,24,26,"That he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee, to cause thee to hear the news with thine oznayim?"
Yechezkel,24,27,"In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more mute; and thou shalt be a mofet unto them; and they shall know that I am Hashem."
Yechezkel,25,1,"The Devar Hashem came again unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,25,2,"Ben adam, set thy face against the Bnei Ammon, and prophesy against them;"
Yechezkel,25,3,"And say unto the Bnei Ammon, Hear the Devar Adonoi Hashem : thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Because thou saidst, Aha, against my [Beis Ha]Mikdash, when it was desecrated; and against Admat Yisroel, when it was laid waste; and against the Bais Yehudah, when they went into Golus;"
Yechezkel,25,4,"Hineni, therefore I will deliver thee to the Bnei Kedem for a morashah (possession, inheritance) , and they shall set up their camps in thee, and make their mishkanim in thee; they shall eat thy pri, and they shall drink thy cholov (milk)."
Yechezkel,25,5,"And I will make Rabbah a pasture for gemalim (camels) , and the Bnei Ammon a resting place for tzon; and ye shall have da'as that I am Hashem."
Yechezkel,25,6,"For thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Because thou hast clapped thine hands, and stamped with the regel, and rejoiced with all thy malice against Admat Yisroel;"
Yechezkel,25,7,"Hineni, therefore I will stretch out mine yad upon thee, and will hand thee over for plunder to the Goyim; and I will cut thee off from the nations, and I will cause thee to perish from the countries; I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I am Hashem."
Yechezkel,25,8,"Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Because Moav and Se'ir do say, Hinei, the Bais Yehudah is like all the Goyim;"
Yechezkel,25,9,"Therefore, hineni, I will open the flank of Moav of its towns, of its towns which are on its frontier, the glory of the Eretz Beit-HaYeshimot, Ba'al-Me'on, and Kiryatayim."
Yechezkel,25,10,"Unto the Bnei Kedem along with the Bnei Ammon will I give them as a morashah, so that the Bnei Ammon will not be remembered among the Goyim."
Yechezkel,25,11,And I will execute shfatim (punishments) upon Moav; and they shall know that I am Hashem.
Yechezkel,25,12,"Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Because Edom hath dealt against the Bais Yehudah by taking vengeance, and with great asham (guilt) offended, and revenged himself upon them;"
Yechezkel,25,13,"Therefore thus saith Adonoi Hashem : I will also stretch out Mine yad upon Edom, and will cut off adam and behemah from it; and I will make it desolate; from Teman even to Dedan shall they fall by the cherev."
Yechezkel,25,14,"And I will take My vengeance upon Edom by the yad of My people Yisroel; and they shall do in Edom according to Mine anger and according to My fury; and they shall know My vengeance, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,25,15,"Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Because the Pelishtim (Philistines) have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with malice in nefesh, to destroy it for the eyvat olam (ancient enmity);"
Yechezkel,25,16,"Therefore thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Hineni, I will stretch out Mine yad upon the Pelishtim (Philistines) , and I will cut off the Keretim, and destroy the she'erit (remnant) of the seacoast."
Yechezkel,25,17,"And I will execute great vengeance upon them with tokhechot chemah (punishments of wrath) ; and they shall know that I am Hashem , when I shall take my vengeance upon them."
Yechezkel,26,1,"And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first day of the month, that the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,26,2,"Ben adam, because that Tzor (Tyre) hath said against Yerushalayim, Aha, she is broken that was the daletot (gates) of the nations; she is turned over to me; I shall be filled, now that she is laid waste;"
Yechezkel,26,3,"Therefore thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Hineni, I am against thee, O Tzor (Tyre) , and will cause Goyim rabbim to come up against thee, like the yam (sea) causeth its waves to come up."
Yechezkel,26,4,"And they shall destroy the chomot (walls) of Tzor (Tyre) , and break down her migdalim (towers) ; I will also scrape her aphar from her, and make her into a barren rock."
Yechezkel,26,5,"It shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the yam; for I have spoken it, saith Adonoi Hashem ; and it shall become a plunder to the Goyim."
Yechezkel,26,6,And her banot which are in the sadeh shall be slain by the cherev; and they shall know that I am Hashem.
Yechezkel,26,7,"For thus saith Adonoi Hashem ; Hineni, I will bring upon Tzor (Tyre) Nevukhadretzar Melech Bavel, a melech melachim, from the tzafon (north) , with sus, and with chariots, and with parashim, and a kahal with much people."
Yechezkel,26,8,"He shall slay with the cherev thy banot in the sadeh; and he shall heap up a siege mound against thee, and build a ramp against thee, and lift up the shield against thee."
Yechezkel,26,9,"And he shall set battering rams against thy chomot (walls) , and with his weapons he shall break down thy migdalim (towers)."
Yechezkel,26,10,"By reason of the abundance of his susim their dust shall cover thee; thy chomot (walls) shall shake at the noise of the parash (war-horse) , and of the galgal (wheel) , and of the chariots, when he shall enter into thy she'arim, as invaders swarm into a breached ir."
Yechezkel,26,11,"With the hooves of his susim shall he trample down all thy streets; he shall slay thy people by the cherev, and thy strong pillars shall fall to the eretz."
Yechezkel,26,12,"And they shall plunder thy riches, and pillage thy merchandise; and they shall break down thy chomot, and destroy thy batim (houses) of chemdah (desire); and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy aphar in the midst of the mayim."
Yechezkel,26,13,And I will cause the sound of thy shirim (songs) to cease; and the sound of thy kinnorot shall be no more heard.
Yechezkel,26,14,"And I will make thee like the top of a barren rock; thou shalt be for spreading nets upon; thou shalt be rebuilt no more; for I Hashem have spoken it, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,26,15,"Thus saith Adonoi Hashem to Tzor (Tyre) : Shall not the coastlands tremble fearfully at the sound of thy fall, when the chalal (wounded) cry, when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee?"
Yechezkel,26,16,"Then all the nasi'im of the yam shall come down from their kisse'ot (thrones) , and lay aside their robes, and put off their embroidered garments; they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit upon ha'aretz, and shall tremble at every moment, and be horrified at thee."
Yechezkel,26,17,"And they shall take up a kinah (lament, funeral dirge) for thee, and say to thee, How thou hast perished, that wast inhabited of seafaring men, the renowned ir (city) , which wast chazakah on the yam, she and her inhabitants, which spread their terror — all who live there."
Yechezkel,26,18,"Now shall the coastlands tremble in the day of thy fall; indeed, the coastlands that are in the yam shall be traumatized at thy exile."
Yechezkel,26,19,"For thus saith Adonoi Hashem : When I shall make thee a desolate ir, like the towns that are not inhabited; when I shall bring up the tehom upon thee, and the mayim harabbim (great waters) shall cover thee;"
Yechezkel,26,20,"When I shall bring thee down with them that descend into the bor (pit) , with the people of old time, and shall set thee in the low parts of ha'aretz, in places desolate from of old, with them that go down to the bor (pit) , so that thou be not inhabited; but I shall bestow splendor on Eretz Chayyim;"
Yechezkel,26,21,"I will make thee a terror, and thou shalt be no more; though thou be sought for, yet shalt thou never be found again, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,27,1,"The Davar Hashem came again unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,27,2,"Now, thou ben adam, take up a kinah (lamentation) for Tzor (Tyre);"
Yechezkel,27,3,"And say unto Tzor (Tyre) , O thou that dwell at the entrance of the yam, which art a merchant of the peoples for many coastlands, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem ; O Tzor (Tyre) , thou hast said, I am perfect in beauty."
Yechezkel,27,4,"Thy borders are in the midst of the seas, thy bonim (builders) have perfected thy beauty."
Yechezkel,27,5,They have built all thy ship plank boards of beroshim (juniper) of Senir; they have taken cedars from Levanon to make masts for thee.
Yechezkel,27,6,"Of the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; thy hull of pines inlaid with ivory, they made from that brought out of the isles of Kittim (Cyprus)."
Yechezkel,27,7,Fine linen with embroidered work from Mitzrayim was that which thou spreadest forth to be thy nes (sail) ; blue and purple from the coasts of Elishah was that which covered thee.
Yechezkel,27,8,"The inhabitants of Tzidon and Arvad were thy oarsmen; thy chachamim, O Tzor (Tyre) , that were in thee, were thy helmsmen."
Yechezkel,27,9,The elders of Geval and the chachamim thereof were in thee thy caulkers to caulk thy seams; all the oniyyot of the yam with their oarsmen were in thee to market thy merchandise.
Yechezkel,27,10,"They of Paras (Persia) and of Lud (Lydia) and of Put (Libya) were in thine army, thy anshei hamilchamah; they hanged the mogen and kova (helmet) in thee; they set forth thy splendor."
Yechezkel,27,11,"The Bnei Arvad with thine army were upon thy chomot (walls) all around, and the men of Gammad were in thy migdalim (towers) ; they hung their shields upon thy chomot (walls) all around; they have made thy beauty perfect."
Yechezkel,27,12,"Tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all kind of riches; with kesef, barzel (iron) , bedil (tin) , and oferet (lead) , they traded for thy goods."
Yechezkel,27,13,"Yavan, Tuval, and Meshech, they were thy merchants; they traded the nefesh adam and kelim (vessels) of nechoshet for thy merchandise."
Yechezkel,27,14,They of the Bais Togarmah traded for thy wares with susim and parash and peradim (mules).
Yechezkel,27,15,The Bnei Dedan were thy merchants; many coastlands were the market of thine yad; they brought thee for a payment karnot (tusks) of shen (ivory) and ebony.
Yechezkel,27,16,"Aram (Syria) was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the goods of thy making; they gave thee for thy wares emeralds, purple, and embroidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and rubies."
Yechezkel,27,17,"Yehudah, and Eretz Yisroel, they were thy merchants; they traded for thy merchandise chittim (wheat) of Minnit, and balsam oil, and devash, and shemen, and balm."
Yechezkel,27,18,"Damascus was thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy making, for the multitude of all riches; in the yayin of Chelbon, and white wool."
Yechezkel,27,19,"Vedan also and Yavan (Greece) provided for your wares with fine yarn; wrought iron, cassia, and cane, were among thy merchandise."
Yechezkel,27,20,Dedan was thy merchant in saddle blankets for riding.
Yechezkel,27,21,"Arabia, and all the nasi'im of Kedar, they traded with thee in lambs, and rams, and goats; in these were they thy merchants."
Yechezkel,27,22,"The merchants of Sheva and Ra'amah, they were thy merchants; they traded as peddlers with choicest spices, and with all kinds of even yekarah (precious stones) , and zahav."
Yechezkel,27,23,"Charan, and Kanneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheva, Ashur (Assyria) , and Kilmad, were thy merchants."
Yechezkel,27,24,"These were thy merchants in choice things, in purple clothes, and embroidered work, and in chests of multicolored apparel, bound with chavalim (cords) and cedar boxed in thy marketplace."
Yechezkel,27,25,"The oniyyot of Tarshish were carriers of thy merchandise; and thou wast filled, and made very glorious in the midst of the yamim (seas)."
Yechezkel,27,26,Thy oarsmen have brought thee into mayim rabbim; the east wind hath broken thee in the midst of the yamim (seas).
Yechezkel,27,27,"Thy riches, and thy wares, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy sailors, thy caulkers, and the dealers in thy merchandise, and all thy anshei hamilchamah, that are in thee, and in all thy kahal (company) which is in the midst of thee, shall fall into the midst of the yamim (seas) in the day of thy shipwreck."
Yechezkel,27,28,The migroshot (open pasturelands) shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy seamen.
Yechezkel,27,29,"And all that handle the oar, the mariners, and all the sailors of the yam, shall come down from their oniyyot, they shall stand upon the shore;"
Yechezkel,27,30,"And shall cause their kol (voice) to be heard because of thee, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up aphar (dust) upon their heads, they shall roll themselves in the ashes;"
Yechezkel,27,31,"And they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee, and gird themselves with sackcloth and shall weep for thee with mar nefesh and bitter mourning."
Yechezkel,27,32,"And in their wailing they shall take up a kinah (lamentation) for thee, and lament over thee, saying, Who is like Tzor, like the destroyed in the midst of the yam?"
Yechezkel,27,33,"When thy wares went forth by sea, thou filledst many people; thou didst enrich the melachim of ha'aretz with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise."
Yechezkel,27,34,"In the time when thou shalt be broken by the yamim (seas) in the depths of the mayim, thy merchandise and all thy kahal (company) in the midst of thee shall fall."
Yechezkel,27,35,"All the inhabitants of the coastlands shall be astonished at thee, and their melachim shall be very afraid, they shall be troubled in their countenance."
Yechezkel,27,36,"The socharim (merchants) among the people shall hiss at thee; thou shalt be a horror, and ad olam (forever) thou shalt be no more."
Yechezkel,28,1,"The Davar Hashem came again unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,28,2,"Ben adam, say unto the Nagid Tzor, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Because thine lev is lifted up [in pride], and thou hast said, El ani (I am a g-d) , and I sit on a moshav elohim (seat of g-ds) , in the midst of the yamim (seas) ; yet thou art adam, and not El, though thou set thine mind as the lev elohim;"
Yechezkel,28,3,"Hinei, thou art more chacham than Daniel; there is no secret that they can hide from thee;"
Yechezkel,28,4,"With thy chochmah and with thine tevunah (understanding) thou hast gotten thee riches, and hast gotten zahav and kesef into thy otzarot;"
Yechezkel,28,5,"By thy great chochmah in thy trade hast thou increased thy riches, and thine lev is lifted up [in pride] because of thy riches;"
Yechezkel,28,6,Therefore thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Because thou hast set thine mind as the lev elohim;
Yechezkel,28,7,"Hineni, therefore I will bring zarim upon thee, the most terrible of the Goyim; and they shall draw their charavot (swords) against the beauty of thy chochmah, and they shall defile thy splendor."
Yechezkel,28,8,"They shall bring thee down to the shachat (pit) , and thou shalt die the deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the yamim (seas)."
Yechezkel,28,9,"Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, Elohim ani? But thou art adam, and no El, in the yad of him that slayeth thee."
Yechezkel,28,10,"Thou shalt die the deaths of the arelim (uncircumcised) by the yad of zarim; for I have spoken it, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,28,11,"Moreover the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,28,12,"Ben adam, take up a kinah (lamentation) upon HaMelech Tzor (Tyre) , and say unto him, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Thou wast the chotam (seal) of perfection, full of chochmah, and perfect in beauty."
Yechezkel,28,13,"Thou hast been in Eden, Gan Elohim; every even yekarah (precious stone) was thy covering, the ruby, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the turquoise, and the emerald, and zahav; the workmanship of thy hand drums and of thy wind instruments was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created."
Yechezkel,28,14,Thou art the keruv mimshach (anointed cherub) that guardeth; and I have set thee so; thou wast upon the Har Kodesh Elohim; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of eish.
Yechezkel,28,15,"Thou wast tamim in thy drakhim from the day that thou wast created, until wickedness was found in thee."
Yechezkel,28,16,"By the multitude of thy trading they have filled the midst of thee with chamas, and thou hast sinned; therefore I will banish thee as profane out of the Har Elohim; and I will destroy thee, O guardian keruv, from the midst of the stones of eish."
Yechezkel,28,17,"Thine lev was lifted up [in pride] because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy chochmah by reason of thy splendor; I will cast thee to eretz (earth) , I will lay thee before melachim, that they may gaze upon thee."
Yechezkel,28,18,"Thou hast defiled thy mikdashim by the multitude of thine avonot, by the avon of thy trading; therefore will I bring forth an eish from the midst of thee; it shall devour thee, and I will reduce thee to ashes upon ha'aretz in the sight of all them that gaze upon thee."
Yechezkel,28,19,"All they that know thee among the peoples shall be appalled at thee; thou shalt be a horror, and thou shalt be no more, ad olam."
Yechezkel,28,20,"Again the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,28,21,"Ben adam, set thy face toward Tzidon (Sidon) , and prophesy against it,"
Yechezkel,28,22,"And say, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Hineni, I am against thee, O Tzidon; and I will be glorified in the midst of thee; and they shall know that I am Hashem , when I shall have executed shefatim (punishments, judgments) in her, and I shall show Myself as set apart as kodesh in her."
Yechezkel,28,23,"For I will send into her dever, and dahm into her streets; and the slain shall be judged in the midst of her by the cherev upon her on every side; and they shall know that I am Hashem."
Yechezkel,28,24,"And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the Bais Yisroel, nor any painful kotz (thorn) of all that are around them, that despised them; and they shall know that I am Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,28,25,"Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : When I shall have gathered the Bais Yisroel from the people among whom they are scattered, and I shall show Myself as set apart as kodesh in them in the sight of the Goyim, then shall they dwell in their adamah (land) that I have given to Avdi Ya'akov (My servant Jacob)."
Yechezkel,28,26,"And they shall dwell securely therein, and shall build batim (houses) , and plant kramim (vineyards) ; indeed, they shall dwell securely, when I have executed shefatim (judgments) upon all those that despise them all around them; and they shall know that I am Hashem Eloheihem."
Yechezkel,29,1,"In the tenth year, in the tenth month, in the twelfth day of the month, the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,29,2,"Ben adam, set thy face against Pharaoh Melech Mitzrayim, and prophesy against him, and against all Mitzrayim:"
Yechezkel,29,3,"Speak, and say, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Hineni, I am against thee, Pharaoh Melech Mitzrayim, the great monster that lieth in the midst of his channels, which hath said, My Nile is mine own, and I have made it for myself."
Yechezkel,29,4,"But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the dag (fish) of thy channels to stick unto thy scales, and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy river channels, and all the dag (fish) of thy channels shall stick unto thy scales."
Yechezkel,29,5,"And I will throw thee out into the midbar, thee and all the dag (fish) of thy river channels; thou shalt fall upon the open sadeh; thou shalt not be picked up together, nor gathered; I have given thee for food to the beasts of ha'aretz and to the oph HaShomayim."
Yechezkel,29,6,"And all the inhabitants of Mitzrayim shall know that I am Hashem , because they have been mishenet kaneh (a staff of reed) to Bais Yisroel."
Yechezkel,29,7,"When they took hold of thee by thy palm, thou didst splinter, and tear all their katef (shoulder) ; and when they leaned upon thee, thou broke, and madest all their loins unsteady."
Yechezkel,29,8,"Therefore thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Hineni, I will bring a cherev upon thee, and cut off adam and behemah from thee."
Yechezkel,29,9,"And Eretz Mitzrayim shall be desolate and in ruins; and they shall know that I am Hashem ; because he hath said, The Nile is Mine, and I have made it."
Yechezkel,29,10,"Hineni, therefore I am against thee, and against thy river channels, and I will make Eretz Mitzrayim utterly ruins and desolate, from Migdol to Seveneh even unto the border of Kush."
Yechezkel,29,11,"No regel of adam shall pass through it, nor regel of behemah shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited arba'im shanah."
Yechezkel,29,12,"And I will make Eretz Mitzrayim desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate, and her towns among the towns that are laid waste shall be desolate arba'im shanah; and I will scatter the Mitzrayim among the Goyim, and will disperse them through the countries."
Yechezkel,29,13,Yet thus saith Adonoi Hashem : At the end of arba'im shanah will I gather Mitzrayim from the peoples where they were scattered;
Yechezkel,29,14,"And I will bring back the captives of Mitzrayim, and will cause them to return into Eretz Patros, into the land of their ancestry; and they shall be there a lowly mamlachah."
Yechezkel,29,15,"It shall be the shefalah (lowliest) of the mamlechot; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the Goyim; for I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the Goyim."
Yechezkel,29,16,"And it shall be no more the confidence of Bais Yisroel, but shall bring their avon to remembrance, when they turned toward them; but they shall know that I am Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,29,17,"And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first month, in the first day of the month, the Davar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,29,18,"Ben adam, Nevukhadretzar Melech Bavel caused his army to avodah gedolah (labor strenuously) against Tzor (Tyre) ; every rosh was rubbed bare, and every katef (shoulder) was rubbed raw; yet had he no sachar (pay) , nor his army, from Tzor (Tyre) , for the avodah that he had served against it;"
Yechezkel,29,19,"Therefore thus saith Adonoi Hashem ; Hineni, I will give Eretz Mitzrayim unto Nevukhadretzar Melech Bavel; and he shall take her wealth, and take her plunder, and pillage her booty; and it shall be the sachar (wages) for his army."
Yechezkel,29,20,"I have given him Eretz Mitzrayim as his pay for which he worked, because they worked for Me, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,29,21,"In that day will I cause the keren (horn, strength) of Bais Yisroel to atzmiach (branch, sprout) , and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I am Hashem."
Yechezkel,30,1,"The Davar Hashem came again unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,30,2,"Ben adam, prophesy, say, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Wail ye, Alas for the day!"
Yechezkel,30,3,"For the day is near, even the Yom Hashem is near, a Yom Anan (Day of Cloud) ; it shall be the time of the Goyim."
Yechezkel,30,4,"And the cherev shall come upon Mitzrayim, and great anguish shall be in Kush (Ethiopia) , when the slain shall fall in Mitzrayim, and they shall take away her wealth, and her yesodot (foundations) shall be broken down."
Yechezkel,30,5,"Kush, and Put, and Lud, and all the mixed horde, and Libya, and the Bnei Eretz HaBrit with them, shall fall by the cherev."
Yechezkel,30,6,"Thus saith Hashem : They also that support Mitzrayim shall fall; and the ga'on (pride) of her strength shall come down; from Migdol to Seveneh shall they fall within her by the cherev, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,30,7,"And they shall be desolate betoch (in the midst of) the countries that are desolate, and her towns shall be in the midst of the towns that are laid waste."
Yechezkel,30,8,"And they shall know that I am Hashem , when I have set an eish in Mitzrayim, and when all her allies shall be destroyed."
Yechezkel,30,9,"In that day shall malachim go forth from Me in ships to make the complacently secure Ethiopians afraid, and great anguish shall come upon them, as in the Yom Mitzrayim; for, hinei, it cometh."
Yechezkel,30,10,Thus saith Adonoi Hashem ; I will also cause the multitude of Mitzrayim to cease by the yad of Nevukhadretzar Melech Bavel.
Yechezkel,30,11,"He and his army with him, the most terrible of the Goyim, shall be brought in to destroy ha'aretz; and they shall draw their charavot (swords) against Mitzrayim, and fill ha'aretz with the slain."
Yechezkel,30,12,"And I will make the river channels dry, and sell ha'aretz to the yad ra'im; I will make eretz desolate, and all that is therein, by the yad of zarim. I Hashem have spoken it."
Yechezkel,30,13,"Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : I will also destroy the gillulim (idols) , and I will cause their elilim (images, false g-ds) to cease out of Noph; and there shall be no more a nasi of Eretz Mitzrayim; and I will put fear in Eretz Mitzrayim."
Yechezkel,30,14,"And I will make Patros desolate, and will kindle eish, setting fire to Tzoan, and will execute shefatim (judgments, punishments) in No."
Yechezkel,30,15,"And I will pour My fury upon Siyn, the ma'oz (stronghold) of Mitzrayim; and I will cut off the multitude of No."
Yechezkel,30,16,"And I will kindle eish, setting fire to Mitzrayim; Siyn shall writhe in anguish, and No shall be breached, and Noph shall be taken by storm in broad daylight."
Yechezkel,30,17,The bochurim of On and of Pi-Veset shall fall by the cherev; and these towns shall go into captivity.
Yechezkel,30,18,"At Tachpanches also the day shall be darkened, when I shall break there the yokes of Mitzrayim; and the ga'on (pride) of her strength shall cease in her; as for her, an anan (a cloud) shall cover her, and her banot shall go into captivity."
Yechezkel,30,19,Thus will I execute shefatim (judgments) in Mitzrayim; and they shall know that I am Hashem.
Yechezkel,30,20,"And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, in the seventh day of the month, that the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,30,21,"Ben adam, I have broken the zero'a of Pharaoh Melech Mitzrayim; and, hinei, it shall not be bound up to bring refu'ot (healing) , nor a splint put on to bind it, to make it strong to hold the cherev."
Yechezkel,30,22,"Therefore thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Hinei, I am against Pharaoh Melech Mitzrayim, and will break his zero'ot (arms) , the chazakah (strong) , and that which was broken; and I will cause the cherev to fall out of his yad."
Yechezkel,30,23,"And I will scatter Mitzrayim among the Goyim, and will disperse them through the countries."
Yechezkel,30,24,"And I will strengthen the zero'ot (arms) of Melech Bavel, and put My cherev in his yad; but I will break the zero'ot of Pharaoh, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of the mortally wounded."
Yechezkel,30,25,"But I will strengthen the zero'ot (arms) of Melech Bavel, and the zero'ot (arms) of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am Hashem , when I shall put My cherev into the yad of Melech Bavel, and he shall stretch it out against Eretz Mitzrayim."
Yechezkel,30,26,"And I will scatter the Mitzrayim among the Goyim, and disperse them among the countries; and they shall know that I am Hashem."
Yechezkel,31,1,"And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, in the first day of the month, that the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,31,2,"Ben adam, speak unto Pharaoh Melech Mitzrayim, and to his multitude: Whom art thou like in thy greatness?"
Yechezkel,31,3,"Hinei, Ashur (the Assyrian) was a cedar in Levanon with yafeh branches, and with a forest shade, and of a high stature; and his top was above the thick boughs."
Yechezkel,31,4,"The mayim made it grow, the tehom (underground water) set him up in height by her streams flowing all around its planting, and sent her rivulets unto all the trees of the sadeh."
Yechezkel,31,5,"Therefore his height was exalted above kol atzei hasadeh (all the trees of the field) , and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the mayim rabbim, as it sent them out."
Yechezkel,31,6,"All the oph HaShomayim made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the beasts of the sadeh give birth to their young, and under his tzel (shadow) dwelt kol Goyim rabbim."
Yechezkel,31,7,"Thus was he beautiful in his gadol (greatness) , in the length of his branches; for his shoresh (root) reached to mayim rabbim."
Yechezkel,31,8,"The cedars in the Gan Elohim could not compare with him; the pine trees were not like his boughs, and the plane trees were not like his branches; nor any etz (tree) in the Gan Elohim was like unto him in his beauty."
Yechezkel,31,9,"I have made him beautiful by the multitude of his branches: so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the Gan Elohim, envied him."
Yechezkel,31,10,"Therefore thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Because thou hast increased thyself in height, and he hath shot up his top above the thick boughs, and his lev is proudly lifted up in his height,"
Yechezkel,31,11,I have therefore delivered him into the yad of the mighty one of the Goyim; he shall surely deal with him; I have driven him out according to his wickedness.
Yechezkel,31,12,"And zarim, the most terrible of the Goyim, have cut him down, and have left him; upon the harim and in all the ge'ayot (valleys) his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the ravines of the earth; and kol Amei HaAretz (all the nations of the earth) departed from his tzel (shade) , and forsook him."
Yechezkel,31,13,"Upon his ruin shall all the oph Shomayim remain, and all the beasts of the sadeh shall come to his branches;"
Yechezkel,31,14,"To the end that none of all the trees by the mayim exalt themselves for their height, neither shoot up their top above the thick boughs, and that no trees that drink mayim may reach up to them in height; for they are all delivered unto mavet, to the depths of ha'aretz, in the midst of the bnei adam, with them that go down to the bor (pit)."
Yechezkel,31,15,"Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : In the day when he went down to Sheol I caused a mourning; I covered the tehom (deep) for him, and I restrained the rivers thereof, and the mayim rabbim were held back; and I caused Levanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the sadeh wilted and fainted for him."
Yechezkel,31,16,"I made the Goyim to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to Sheol with them that descend into the bor (pit) ; and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Levanon, all that drink mayim, shall be consoled in the depths of ha'aretz."
Yechezkel,31,17,"They also went down into Sheol with him unto them that be slain with the cherev; and they that were his zero'a, that dwelt under his tzel (shade) in the midst of the Goyim."
Yechezkel,31,18,"To whom art thou thus like in kavod and in greatness among the trees of Eden? Yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the depths of ha'aretz; thou shalt lie in the midst of the arelim (uncircumcised) with them that be slain by the cherev. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,32,1,"And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first day of the month, that the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,32,2,"Ben adam, take up a kinah (lamentation) for Pharaoh Melech Mitzrayim, and say unto him, Thou art like a lion of the Goyim, and thou art as a sea monster in the yamim (seas) ; and thou thrash about in thy rivers, and troubledst the mayim with thy feet, and fouledst their rivers."
Yechezkel,32,3,Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : I will therefore spread out My net over thee with a kahal of amim rabbim; and they shall draw thee up in My net.
Yechezkel,32,4,"Then will I throw thee upon ha'aretz, I will cast thee forth upon the open sadeh, and will cause all the oph HaShomayim to settle upon thee, and I will fill the beasts of kol ha'aretz (the whole earth) with thee."
Yechezkel,32,5,"And I will lay thy basar upon the harim, and fill the ge'ayot (valleys) with thy height."
Yechezkel,32,6,I will also water with thy flowing dahm eretz even up to the harim; and the ravines shall be full of thee.
Yechezkel,32,7,"And when I shall put out thy light, I will cover the Shomayim, and make the kokhavim thereof dark; I will cover the shemesh with an anan (cloud) , and the yarei'ach (moon) shall not give her light."
Yechezkel,32,8,"All the bright lights of Shomayim will I make dark over thee, and set choshech upon thy land, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,32,9,"I will also trouble the hearts of amim rabbim (many peoples) , when I shall bring thy destruction among the Goyim, into the countries which thou hast not known."
Yechezkel,32,10,"Indeed, I will make amim rabbim (many peoples) appalled at thee, and their melachim shall be horribly afraid because of thee when I brandish My cherev before them; and they shall tremble at every moment, every ish for his own nefesh, in the day of thy downfall."
Yechezkel,32,11,For thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Cherev of Melech Bavel shall come upon thee.
Yechezkel,32,12,"By the charavot (swords) of the gibborim (mighty) will I cause thy multitude to fall, the most terrible of the Goyim, all of them; and they shall plunder the ga'on (pomp) of Mitzrayim, and all the multitude thereof shall be made shmad."
Yechezkel,32,13,"I will destroy also all the behemah thereof from beside the mayim rabbim; neither shall the regel adam muddy them any more, nor the hooves of beasts muddy them."
Yechezkel,32,14,"Then will I make their mayim clear, and cause their rivers to run like shemen, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,32,15,"When I shall make Eretz Mitzrayim desolate, and the country shall be destitute of that whereof it was full, when I shall strike all them that dwell therein, then shall they know that I am Hashem."
Yechezkel,32,16,"This is the kinah (lamentation) wherewith they shall lament her; the banot of the Goyim shall lament her; they shall lament for her, even for Mitzrayim, and for all her multitude, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,32,17,"It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day of the month, that the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,32,18,"Ben adam, wail for the multitude of Mitzrayim, and send them down, even her, and the banot of the mighty Goyim, unto the depths of ha'aretz, with them that go down into the bor (pit)."
Yechezkel,32,19,"Whom dost thou surpass in beauty? Go down, and be thou laid with the arelim (uncircumcised)."
Yechezkel,32,20,They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the cherev; she is delivered to the cherev; drag her off and all her multitudes.
Yechezkel,32,21,"The mightiest among the gibborim shall speak to him out of the midst of Sheol with them [that as allies] help him; they are gone down, they lie with the arelim (uncircumcised) , slain by the cherev."
Yechezkel,32,22,"Ashur (Assyria) is there and all her kahal; his kevarim are about him; all of them slain, fallen by the cherev;"
Yechezkel,32,23,"Whose kevarim are set in the recesses of the bor (pit) , and her kahal (company) is all around her kevurah; all of them slain, fallen by the cherev, which caused terror in Eretz Chayyim."
Yechezkel,32,24,"There is Eilam and all her multitude around her kevurah, all of them slain, fallen by the cherev, which are gone down arelim (uncircumcised) into the lower parts of ha'aretz, which caused their terror in Eretz Chayyim; yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the bor (pit)."
Yechezkel,32,25,"They have set her a mishkav (bed) in the midst of the slain with all her multitude; her kevarim are all around him; all of them arelim (uncircumcised) , slain by the cherev; for they spread terror in Eretz Chayyim, yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the bor (pit) ; he is put in the midst of them that are slain."
Yechezkel,32,26,"There is Meshech, Tuval, and all her multitude; her kevarim are all around him; all of them arelim (uncircumcised) , slain by the cherev, though they caused their terror in Eretz Chayyim."
Yechezkel,32,27,"And they shall not lie with the gibborim that are fallen of the arelim (uncircumcised) , which are gone down to Sheol with their weapons of milchamah; and they have laid their charavot (swords) under their heads, but their avonot shall be upon their atzmot, though they were the terror of the gibborim in Eretz Chayyim."
Yechezkel,32,28,"Indeed, thou shalt be broken in the midst of the arelim (uncircumcised) , and shalt lie with them that are slain with the cherev."
Yechezkel,32,29,"There is Edom, her melachim, and all her nasi'im, which despite their gevurah (might) are laid beside them that were slain by the cherev; they shall lie with the arelim (uncircumcised) , and with them that go down to the bor."
Yechezkel,32,30,"There are the princes of the north, all of them, and all those of Tzidon, which are gone down with the slain; in shame at the terror which they caused by their gevurah (might) ; and they lie as arelim (uncircumcised) with them that be slain by the cherev, and bear their shame with them that go down to the bor."
Yechezkel,32,31,"Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be consoled over all his multitude, even Pharaoh and all his army slain by the cherev, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,32,32,"For I have caused My terror in Eretz Chayyim; and he shall be laid in the midst of the arelim (uncircumcised) with them that are slain with the cherev, even Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,33,1,"Again the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,33,2,"Ben Adam, speak to the Bnei Amecha, and say unto them, When I bring the cherev upon eretz, if the Am HaAretz take ish echad (one man) within their midst, and appoint him for their tzofeh (watchman, sentinel),"
Yechezkel,33,3,"If when he seeth the cherev come upon HaAretz, he blow the shofar, and warn HaAm;"
Yechezkel,33,4,"Then whosoever heareth the sound of the shofar, and taketh not warning; if the cherev come, and take him away, his dahm shall be upon his own rosh."
Yechezkel,33,5,"He heard the sound of the shofar, and took not warning; his dahm shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall save his nefesh."
Yechezkel,33,6,"But if the tzofeh (watchman, sentinel) see the cherev coming, and blow not the shofar, and HaAm be not warned; if the cherev come, and take any nefesh from among them, he is taken away in his avon (iniquity) ; but for his dahm will I require [an accounting] at the yad HaTzofeh."
Yechezkel,33,7,"So thou, O Ben Adam, I have set thee a tzofeh unto the Bais Yisroel; therefore thou shalt hear the Davar at My mouth, and give them warning from Me."
Yechezkel,33,8,"When I say unto the rashah (wicked man) , O rashah, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the rashah from his derech, that rashah shall die in his avon (iniquity) ; but for his dahm will I require [an accounting] at thine yad."
Yechezkel,33,9,"Nevertheless, if thou warn the rashah of his derech to turn from it; if he does not turn from his derech, he shall die in his avon (iniquity) ; but thou hast saved thy nefesh."
Yechezkel,33,10,"Therefore, O thou Ben Adam, speak unto Bais Yisroel: Thus ye have spoken, saying, If peysha'einu (our transgressions, rebellions) and chattoteinu (our sins) be upon us, and because of them we are rotting away, how should we then live?"
Yechezkel,33,11,"Say unto them, As I live, saith Adonoi Hashem , I have no pleasure in the mot of the rashah; but that the rashah make teshuvah from his derech and live; shuvu (turn ye) , shuvu (turn ye) from your drakhim hara'im; for why will ye die, O Bais Yisroel?"
Yechezkel,33,12,"Therefore, thou Ben Adam, say unto the Bnei Amecha, The tzidkat hatzaddik (righteousness of a righteous man) shall not save him in his Yom Peysha (Day of Rebellion, Day of his Transgession) ; as for the rishat harashah, he shall not fall thereby in his Yom Shuv (Day of Turning, Repentance) from his resha; neither shall the tzaddik be able to live his tzedakah in his Yom Chattot (day when he commits sin)."
Yechezkel,33,13,"When I shall say to the tzaddik, that he shall surely live, if he trust in his own tzedakah, and commit evil, all his tzidkot (righteousnesses) shall not be remembered; but for his evil that he hath committed, he shall die in it."
Yechezkel,33,14,"Again, when I say unto the rashah, Thou shalt surely die and he turn from his chattat, and do that which is mishpat and tzedakah;"
Yechezkel,33,15,"If the rashah give back the chavol (borrowerʼs pledge) , give back what he has stolen, walk in the chukkot hachayyim, without committing evil; he shall surely live, he shall not die."
Yechezkel,33,16,None of his chattot that he hath committed shall be remembered against him; he hath done that which is mishpat and tzedakah; he shall surely live.
Yechezkel,33,17,"Yet the Bnei Amecha say, The Derech Adonoi is not proper; but as for them, their derech is not proper."
Yechezkel,33,18,"When the tzaddik turneth from his tzedakah, and committeth evil, he shall even die thereby."
Yechezkel,33,19,"But if the rashah turn from his resha, and do that which is mishpat and tzedakah, he shall live thereby."
Yechezkel,33,20,"Yet ye say, The Derech Adonoi is not proper. O ye Bais Yisroel, I will judge you every one according to his drakhim."
Yechezkel,33,21,"And it came to pass in the twelfth shanah of our Golus, in the tenth month, on the fifth day of the month, that one that had escaped out of Yerushalayim came unto me, saying, The Ir (City, Jerusalem) has fallen."
Yechezkel,33,22,"Now the Yad Hashem was upon me in the erev before he that was escaped arrived; and He had opened my mouth before he came to me in the boker; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb."
Yechezkel,33,23,"Then the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,33,24,"Ben Adam, they that inhabit those ruins of Admat Yisroel speak, saying, Avraham was one, and he inherited HaAretz; but we are rabbim; HaAretz is given to us for an inherited possession."
Yechezkel,33,25,"Therefore say unto them, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem ; Ye eat al hadahm and lift up your eyes toward your gillulim, and do shefach dahm — even so shall you inherit the possession of HaAretz?"
Yechezkel,33,26,"Ye rely upon your cherev, ye work toevah, and ye defile every one his neighborʼs isha; and shall ye inherit as a possession HaAretz?"
Yechezkel,33,27,"Say thou thus unto them, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : As I live, surely they that are in the ruins shall fall by the cherev, and him that is in the open sadeh will I give to the wild animals to be devoured, and they that be in the metzudot (strongholds) and in the me'arot (caves) shall die of dever (plague)."
Yechezkel,33,28,"For I will make HaAretz most desolate, and the ga'on (pride, pomp) of her oz (strength) shall cease; and the harim of Yisroel shall be desolate, that none pass through."
Yechezkel,33,29,"Then shall they know that I am Hashem , when I have made HaAretz a desolation and a waste because of all their to'avot which they have committed."
Yechezkel,33,30,"Also, thou Ben Adam, the Bnei Amecha still are talking against thee by the kirot (walls) and in the doorways of the batim (houses) , and speak one to another, every one to achiv (his brother) , saying, Come, now, and hear what is the Davar that cometh forth from Hashem."
Yechezkel,33,31,"And they come unto thee as Am cometh, and they sit before thee as Ami, and they hear thy devarim, but they will not practice them; for with their mouth there is agavim (lusts) , but their lev pursueth after their betza (unjust gain)."
Yechezkel,33,32,"And, hinei, thou art unto them nothing more than one with a kol yafeh (beautiful voice) who sings shir agavim (sensual love songs) and can play well on a musical instrument; for they hear thy devarim, but they do them not."
Yechezkel,33,33,"And when this cometh to pass — hinei, it will come — then shall they know that a navi hath been among them."
Yechezkel,34,1,"And the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,34,2,"Ben Adam, prophesy against the ro'im (shepherds) of Yisroel, prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem unto the ro'im (shepherds) ; Oy to the ro'im (shepherds) of Yisroel who are ro'im tending to themselves! Should not the ro'im (shepherds) be ro'im tending to the tzon (flock)?"
Yechezkel,34,3,"Ye eat the chelev, and ye clothe you with the tzemer (wool) , ye slaughter the healthy; but ye are not ro'im that tend the tzon."
Yechezkel,34,4,"The weak have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was cholah (sick) , neither have ye bound up the nishberet (injured ones) , neither have ye brought back that which was straying, neither have ye sought haovedet (the lost) ; but with chazekah (force) and with perek (harshness, severity) have ye ruled them."
Yechezkel,34,5,"And they were scattered, because there is no ro'eh; and they became okhel (food) to kol chayyat hasadeh, when they were scattered."
Yechezkel,34,6,"My tzon wandered through all the harim, and upon every high givah (hill) ; yes, My tzon was scattered upon all the face of ha'aretz, and none did search or seek after them."
Yechezkel,34,7,"Therefore, ye ro'im, hear the Devar Hashem:"
Yechezkel,34,8,"As I live, saith Adonoi Hashem , surely because My tzon became a prey, and My tzon became okhel to kol chayyat hasadeh, because there was no ro'eh, neither did My ro'im (shepherds) search for My tzon, but the ro'im (shepherds) were ro'im tending to themselves, and tended not My tzon;"
Yechezkel,34,9,"Therefore, O ye ro'im, hear the Devar Hashem:"
Yechezkel,34,10,"Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Hineni, I am against the ro'im; and I will require an accounting for My tzon at their yad, and cause them to cease from being ro'im to the tzon; neither shall the ro'im (shepherds) be ro'im tending to themselves any more; for I will save My tzon from their mouth, that they may not be okhel for them."
Yechezkel,34,11,"For thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Hineni, I, even I, will both search for My tzon, and seek after them."
Yechezkel,34,12,"As a ro'eh seeketh after his tzon in the day that he is among his tzon that are scattered; so will I seek after My tzon, and will save them out of kol hamekomot (all the places) where they have been scattered there in the yom anan va'arafel (day of clouds and thick darkness)."
Yechezkel,34,13,"And I will bring them out from HaAmim, and gather them from the aratzot (countries) , and will bring them to their own adamah, and I will tend them as Ro'eh upon the harim of Yisroel by the ravines, and in all the moshevei HaAretz."
Yechezkel,34,14,"I will give them feeding of a roeh in a mireh tov (good pasture) and upon the high harim of Yisroel shall their naveh (fold, abode of sheep) be; there shall they lie in a naveh tov, and in a mireh shamen (fat pasture) shall they feed upon the harim of Yisroel."
Yechezkel,34,15,"As a ro'eh will I tend My tzon, and I will cause them to lie down, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,34,16,"I will seek haovedet (that which was lost) , and bring back that which was straying, and will bind up the nishberet (that which was injured) , and will strengthen the cholah (sick) ; but I will destroy the shemenah (stout, sleek) and the chazakah; I will tend to them with mishpat (justice)."
Yechezkel,34,17,"And as for you, O My tzon, thus saith Adonoi Hashem ; Hineni, I judge between seh and seh, between the rams and the goats."
Yechezkel,34,18,"Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the mireh hatov (good pasture) , that ye must also trample down with your raglayim what is left of your mirim (pastures) ? And to have drunk of the clear mayim, but ye must also foul the rest with your raglayim?"
Yechezkel,34,19,"And as for My tzon, they feed on that which ye have trampled with your raglayim; and they drink that which ye have fouled with your raglayim."
Yechezkel,34,20,"Therefore thus saith Adonoi Hashem unto them; Hineni, I, even I, will act as shofet between the seh biryah (fat lamb) and between the seh razah (emaciated lamb)."
Yechezkel,34,21,"Because ye have thrust with flank and with shoulder, and butted all the weak emaciated ones with your karnayim, till ye have scattered them abroad;"
Yechezkel,34,22,"Therefore will I save My tzon, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will act as shofet between seh and seh."
Yechezkel,34,23,"And I will set up Ro'eh Echad over them, He shall tend them as ro'eh, even Avdi Dovid; He shall feed them. He shall be their Ro'eh."
Yechezkel,34,24,"And I Hashem will be their Elohim, and Avdi Dovid a Nasi among them; I Hashem have spoken."
Yechezkel,34,25,"And I will make with them a Brit Shalom, and will cause the chayyah ra'ah to cease out of HaAretz; and they shall dwell safely in the midbar, and sleep in the ye'arot (forests)."
Yechezkel,34,26,And I will make them and the places surrounding My givah (hill) a brocha; and I will cause the geshem to come down in its season; there shall be gishmei brocha (showers of blessing).
Yechezkel,34,27,"And the etz hasadeh shall yield her p'ri, and ha'aretz shall yield her increase, and they shall be safe in their adamah, and shall know that I am Hashem , when I have broken the bars of their ol (yoke) , and saved them out of the yad haovedim (hand, power of enslavers) of them."
Yechezkel,34,28,"And they shall no more be a prey to the Goyim, neither shall the chayyat HaAretz devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and none shall make them afraid."
Yechezkel,34,29,"And I will raise up for them a planting of renown, and they shall be no more consumed with ra'av in HaAretz, neither bear the shame of the Goyim any more."
Yechezkel,34,30,"Thus shall they know that I Hashem Eloheihem am with them, and that they, even Bais Yisroel, are My people, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,34,31,"And ye My tzon, the tzon of My mireh, are adam, and I am Eloheichem, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,35,1,"Moreover the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,35,2,"Ben adam, set thy face against Har Se'ir, and prophesy against it,"
Yechezkel,35,3,"And say unto it, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Hineni, O Har Se'ir, I am against thee, and I will stretch out Mine yad against thee, and I will make thee a desolation and a waste."
Yechezkel,35,4,"I will lay thy towns waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I am Hashem."
Yechezkel,35,5,"Because thou hast had an eivat olam (ancient enmity) , and delivered over the Bnei Yisroel to the power of the cherev at the time of their calamity, in the time of their avon ketz (final punishment)."
Yechezkel,35,6,"Therefore, as I live, saith Adonoi Hashem , I will turn thee unto dahm, and dahm shall pursue thee; since thou hast not hated dahm, even dahm shall pursue thee."
Yechezkel,35,7,"Thus will I make Har Se'ir most desolate, and cut off from it him that goeth and him that cometh."
Yechezkel,35,8,"And I will fill his harim with his slain; in thy geva'ot (hills) , and in thy ge'ayot (valleys) and in all thy ravines, shall they fall that are slain with the cherev."
Yechezkel,35,9,"I will make thee shimemot olam (eternal desolations) , and thy towns shall not be inhabited; and ye shall know that I am Hashem."
Yechezkel,35,10,"Because thou hast said, These two Goyim and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; although Hashem was there;"
Yechezkel,35,11,"Therefore, as I live, saith Adonoi Hashem , I will even do according to thine anger, and according to thine kina (jealousy) which thou hast showed in thy hatred against them; and I will make Myself known among them, when I have judged thee."
Yechezkel,35,12,"And thou shalt know that I am Hashem , and that I have heard all thy insults which thou hast spoken against the harim of Yisroel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given to us to consume."
Yechezkel,35,13,"Thus with your mouth ye have boasted of your greatness against Me, have multiplied your devarim against Me; I have heard them."
Yechezkel,35,14,"Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : When kol ha'aretz (the whole earth) rejoiceth, I will make thee desolate."
Yechezkel,35,15,"As thou didst rejoice at the nachalah of the Bais Yisroel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee; thou shalt be desolate, O Har Se'ir, and all Edom, even all of it; and they shall know that I am Hashem."
Yechezkel,36,1,"Also, thou Ben Adam, prophesy unto the harim of Yisroel, and say, Ye harim of Yisroel hear the Devar Hashem."
Yechezkel,36,2,"Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Because the oyev hath said against you, Aha, even the bamot olam (ancient heights) are ours in possession,"
Yechezkel,36,3,"Therefore prophesy and say, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Because they have made you desolate, and crushed you on every side, that ye might be a possession unto the she'erit HaGoyim, and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers, and are slandered by the people:"
Yechezkel,36,4,"Therefore, ye harim of Yisroel, hear the Devar Adonoi Hashem : Thus saith Adonoi Hashem to the harim, and to the geva'ot, to the ravines, and to the ge'ayot, to desolate ruins, to towns deserted which became a plunder and mockery to the she'erit HaGoyim that are all around;"
Yechezkel,36,5,"Therefore thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Surely in the eish of My kina have I spoken against the she'erit HaGoyim, and against all Edom, which have given My land into their possession with simchat kol levav, with she'at nefesh (scorn of soul, contempt) , as her migrash for plunder."
Yechezkel,36,6,"Prophesy therefore concerning Admat Yisroel, and say unto the harim, and to the geva'ot (hills) , to the ravines, and to the ge'ayot (valleys) , Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Hineni, I have spoken in My kina (jealousy) and in My chemah (fury) , because ye have borne the scorn of the Goyim;"
Yechezkel,36,7,"Therefore thus saith Adonoi Hashem ; I have lifted up Mine yad [in oath-taking], Surely the Goyim that are around you, they shall bear their own scorn."
Yechezkel,36,8,"But ye, O harim of Yisroel, ye shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your p'ri to My people Yisroel; for their return [home] is at hand."
Yechezkel,36,9,"For, hineni, I am for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye shall be plowed and sown;"
Yechezkel,36,10,"And I will multiply adam upon you, kol Bais Yisroel, even all of it; and the towns shall be inhabited, and the ruins shall be rebuilt;"
Yechezkel,36,11,"And I will multiply upon you adam and behemah; and they shall increase and become numerous; and I will make you inhabited as in former times, and I will make you more prosperous than before; and ye shall know that I am Hashem."
Yechezkel,36,12,"Indeed, I will cause adam to walk upon you, even My people Yisroel; and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their nachalah, and thou shalt no more again bereave them of their children."
Yechezkel,36,13,"Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Because they say unto you, Thou art a land which devourest adam, and hast bereaved thy nation of children;"
Yechezkel,36,14,"Therefore thou shalt devour adam no more, neither bereave thy nation any more, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,36,15,"Neither will I cause men to hear in thee the taunts of the Goyim any more, neither shalt thou bear the cherpah of the people any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nation to stumble any more, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,36,16,"Moreover the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,36,17,"Ben adam, when Bais Yisroel dwelt in their own land, they made it tameh by their own derech and by their doings; their derech was before Me as the tumat haniddah (contamination of a woman during her menstrual period)."
Yechezkel,36,18,"Therefore I poured My chemah upon them for their shefach dahm upon ha'aretz, for their gillulim wherewith they had made it tameh;"
Yechezkel,36,19,"And I scattered them among the Goyim, and they were dispersed through the countries; according to their derech and according to their doings I judged them."
Yechezkel,36,20,"And when they entered unto the Goyim, to where they went, they profaned Shem Kodshi (Name of My Holiness, Holy Name) , when they said to them, These are the Am Hashem , and are gone forth out of His land."
Yechezkel,36,21,"But I had concern for Shem Kodshi (Name of My Holiness, Holy Name) , which Bais Yisroel had profaned among the Goyim, where they went."
Yechezkel,36,22,"Therefore say unto Bais Yisroel, thus saith Adonoi Hashem : I do not this for your sakes, O Bais Yisroel, but for the sake of Shem Kodshi, which ye have profaned among Goyim where ye went."
Yechezkel,36,23,"And I will show as kodesh My Shem HaGadol, which was profaned among the Goyim, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the Goyim shall know that I am Hashem , saith Adonoi Hashem , when I shall be set apart as kodesh in you before their eynayim."
Yechezkel,36,24,"For I will take you from among the Goyim, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own adamah (land)."
Yechezkel,36,25,"Then will I sprinkle mayim tehorim upon you, and ye shall be tahor; from all your tum'a, and from all your gillulim (idols) , will I make you tahor."
Yechezkel,36,26,"A lev chadash also will I give you, and a ruach chadashah will I put within you; and I will take away the lev haeven (stony heart) out of your basar, and I will give you a lev basar."
Yechezkel,36,27,"And I will put My Ruach within you, and cause you to walk in My chukkot, and ye shall be shomer over My mishpatim, and do them."
Yechezkel,36,28,"And ye shall dwell in ha'aretz that I gave to avoteichem; and ye shall be My people, and I will be your Elohim."
Yechezkel,36,29,"I will also save you from all your tumot (unclean-nesses) ; and I will call for the dagan (grain) , and will increase it, and lay no ra'av (famine) upon you."
Yechezkel,36,30,"And I will multiply the p'ri ha'etz, and the increase of the sadeh, that ye shall receive no more cherpah of ra'av (famine) among the Goyim."
Yechezkel,36,31,"Then shall ye remember your own drakhim ra'im, and your doings that were not tovim, and shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your avonot and for your to'avot."
Yechezkel,36,32,"Not for your sakes do I this, saith Adonoi Hashem , be it known unto you; be ashamed and humiliated for your own drakhim, O Bais Yisroel."
Yechezkel,36,33,"Thus saith Adonoi Hashem ; In the day that I shall have made you tahor from all your avonot, I will also cause you to resettle the towns, and the ruins shall be rebuilt."
Yechezkel,36,34,"And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay shemamah (desolate) in the sight of all that passed by."
Yechezkel,36,35,"And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like Gan Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined towns are become fortified, and are inhabited."
Yechezkel,36,36,"Then the Goyim that are left all around you shall know that I Hashem rebuilt the ruined places, and replanted that that was desolate; I Hashem have spoken it, and I will do it."
Yechezkel,36,37,"Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Also I will be inquired of by Bais Yisroel, to act in behalf of them; I will increase them adam as numberous as tzon."
Yechezkel,36,38,"As the tzon kadashim, as the tzon Yerushalayim in her mo'adim, so shall the ruined cities be filled with tzon adam; and they shall know that I am Hashem."
Yechezkel,37,1,"The Yad Hashem was upon me, and carried me out in the Ruach of Hashem , and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of atzmot,"
Yechezkel,37,2,"And caused me to pass by them round about; and, hinei, there were rabbot me'od in the open valley; and, hinei, they were very dry."
Yechezkel,37,3,"And He said unto me, Ben Adam, can these atzmot live? And I answered, Adonoi Hashem , Thou knowest."
Yechezkel,37,4,"Again He said unto me, Prophesy upon these atzmot, and say unto them, O ye atzmot hayeveshot, hear the Devar Hashem."
Yechezkel,37,5,"Thus saith Adonoi Hashem unto these atzmot: Hinei, I will cause ruach to enter into you, and ye shall live;"
Yechezkel,37,6,"And I will lay gidim (sinews, tendons) upon you, and will bring up basar upon you, and cover you with ohr (skin) , and put ruach in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall have da'as that I am Hashem."
Yechezkel,37,7,"So I prophesied as I was commanded; and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and hinei a rattling, and the atzmot came together, etzem to its etzem."
Yechezkel,37,8,"And when I beheld, hinei, the gidim and the basar came up upon them, and the ohr covered them above; but there was no ruach in them."
Yechezkel,37,9,"Then said He unto me, Prophesy unto the ruach; prophesy, Ben Adam, and say to the ruach, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Come from the arba ruchot, O ruach, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live."
Yechezkel,37,10,"So I prophesied as He commanded me, and the ruach came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their raglayim, a chayil gadol me'od me'od."
Yechezkel,37,11,"Then He said unto me, Ben Adam, these atzmot are the kol Bais Yisroel. Hinei, they say, Our atzmot are dried up, and tikvateinu (our hope) is gone; nigzarnu lanu (we are cut off)."
Yechezkel,37,12,"Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Hinei, O My people, I will open your keverot, and cause you to come up out of your keverot, and bring you into Admat Yisroel (the Land of Israel)."
Yechezkel,37,13,"And ye shall know that I am Hashem , when I have opened your keverot, O My people, and brought you up out of your keverot,"
Yechezkel,37,14,"And shall put My Ruach in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own land; then shall ye know that I Hashem have spoken it, and performed it, saith Hashem."
Yechezkel,37,15,"The Devar Hashem came again unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,37,16,"Moreover, thou ben adam, take thee Etz Echad, and write upon it, For Yehudah, and for the Bnei Yisroel his chaverim; then take another Etz Echad, and write upon it, For Yosef, the Etz Ephrayim and for kol Bais Yisroel his chaverim;"
Yechezkel,37,17,And join them one to another into Etz Echad; and they shall become achadim (one) in thine yad.
Yechezkel,37,18,"And when the Bnei Amecha speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not show us what thou meanest by these?"
Yechezkel,37,19,"Say unto them, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Hinei, I will take the Etz Yosef, which is in the Yad Ephrayim, and the Shivtei Yisroel his chaverim, and will put them with him, even with the Etz Yehudah, and make them Etz Echad, and they shall be Echad in Mine Yad."
Yechezkel,37,20,And the Etzim whereon thou writest shall be in thine yad before their eyes.
Yechezkel,37,21,"And say unto them, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Hinei, I will take the Bnei Yisroel from among the Goyim, whither they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land;"
Yechezkel,37,22,"And I will make them Goy Echad in the land upon the mountains of Yisroel; and Melech Echad shall be Melech to them all; and they shall be no more two Goyim, neither shall they be divided into two Mamlachot any more at all."
Yechezkel,37,23,"Neither shall they make themselves tameh any more with their gillulim, nor with their shikkutzim, nor with any of their peysha'im; but I will save them out of all their moshavot wherein they have sinned, and will make them tahor; so shall they be My people, and I will be their Elohim."
Yechezkel,37,24,"And Avdi Dovid shall be Melech over them; and they all shall have Ro'eh Echad; they shall also walk in My mishpatim, and observe My chukkot, and do them."
Yechezkel,37,25,"And they shall dwell in HaAretz that I have given unto Avdi Ya'akov, wherein your Avot have dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, even they, and their banim, and their bnei banim ad olam; and Dovid Avdi shall be their Nasi l'olam."
Yechezkel,37,26,"Moreover I will make a Brit Shalom with them; it shall be a Brit Olam with them; and I will establish them, and multiply them, and will set My Mikdash in the midst of them l'olam."
Yechezkel,37,27,"My Mishkan also shall be with them; yes, I will be their Elohim, and they shall be My people."
Yechezkel,37,28,"And the Goyim shall know that I Hashem set apart as kodesh Yisroel, when My Mikdash shall be in the midst of them l'olam (forever)."
Yechezkel,38,1,"And the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Yechezkel,38,2,"Ben adam, set thy face against Gog, Eretz HaMagog, the nasi rosh Meshech and Tuval, and prophesy against him,"
Yechezkel,38,3,"And say, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Hineni, I am against thee, O Gog, the nasi rosh Meshech and Tuval;"
Yechezkel,38,4,"And I will turn thee around, and put hooks into thy jaws, and I will take thee out, and all thine army, susim and parashim, all of them splendidly outfitted, even a kahal rav with body shields and mogen, all of them handling charavot (swords);"
Yechezkel,38,5,"Paras, Kush, and Put with them; all of them with mogen and kova (helmet);"
Yechezkel,38,6,"Gomer, and all its hordes; Bais Togarmah of the north parts, and all his troops; and amim rabbim (many peoples) with thee."
Yechezkel,38,7,"Be thou prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou, and all thy kahal that are assembled unto thee, and serve thou as guard unto them."
Yechezkel,38,8,"After yamim rabbim thou shalt be visited; in the acharit hashanim (future years) thou shalt invade eretz that is recovering from cherev (sword, war) , and [whose inhabitants] have been regathered out of amim rabbim, on the harim of Yisroel, which have long lain desolate; but it is brought forth out of the nations, and they shall dwell securely, all of them."
Yechezkel,38,9,"Thou shalt ascend and advance like a storm, thou shalt be like a storm cloud covering ha'aretz, thou, and all thy troops, and many peoples with thee."
Yechezkel,38,10,"Thus saith Adonoi Hashem ; It shall also come to pass, that on that day thoughts will arise into thy mind, and thou shalt devise a machashevet ra'ah (an evil plan);"
Yechezkel,38,11,"And thou shalt say, I will go up and invade eretz of unwalled villages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell securely, all of them dwelling without chomot (walls) , and having neither bars nor gates,"
Yechezkel,38,12,"To take a plunder, and to take a booty; to turn thine yad upon the desolate places that are now inhabited, and upon the people that are regathered out of the Goyim, which have gotten mikneh (livestock) and goods, that dwell in the midst of ha'aretz."
Yechezkel,38,13,"Sheva, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions thereof, shall say unto thee, Art thou come to take plunder? Hast thou gathered thine army to take booty? To carry away kesef and zahav, to take away mikneh (livestock) and goods, to take a great plunder?"
Yechezkel,38,14,"Therefore, Ben Adam, prophesy and say unto Gog, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : In that day when My people Yisroel dwelleth securely, thou wilt know it!"
Yechezkel,38,15,"And thou shalt come from thy makom (place) out of the far north, thou, and amim rabbim (many peoples) with thee, all of them riding upon susim, a kahal gadol, and a mighty army;"
Yechezkel,38,16,"And thou shalt come up against My people Yisroel, like an anan (cloud) covering ha'aretz; it shall be in the acharit hayamim, and I will bring thee against My land, so that the Goyim may know Me, when I shall be shown as set apart as kodesh in thee, O Gog, before their eynayim."
Yechezkel,38,17,"Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Art thou he of whom I have spoken in old time by My avadim the nevi'im of Yisroel, which prophesied in those days that after many years I would bring thee against them?"
Yechezkel,38,18,"And it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come against Admat Yisroel, saith Adonoi Hashem , that My hot chemah (fury) shall be aroused."
Yechezkel,38,19,"For in My kina (jealousy) and in the eish of My evrah (wrath) have I spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a ra'ash gadol (great earthquake) in Admat Yisroel;"
Yechezkel,38,20,"So that the dagim of the yam, and the oph HaShomayim, and the beasts of the sadeh, and all creeping things that creep upon ha'adamah, and kol ha'adam that are upon the face of adamah, shall shake at My presence, and the harim shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every chomah shall fall to the ground."
Yechezkel,38,21,"And I will call for a cherev against him throughout all My harim, saith Adonoi Hashem ; cherev of every ish shall be against his brother."
Yechezkel,38,22,"And I will judge him with dever and with dahm; and I will rain upon him, and upon his troops, and upon the amim rabbim (many peoples) that are with him, a torrential rain, and great hailstones, eish, and burning gofrit."
Yechezkel,38,23,"Thus will I magnify Myself, and set Myself apart as kodesh and I will make Myself known in the eynayim of Goyim rabbim, and they shall know that I am Hashem."
Yechezkel,39,1,"Therefore, thou Ben Adam, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Hineni, I am against thee, O Gog, nasi rosh Meshech and Tuval;"
Yechezkel,39,2,"And I will turn thee around, and drive thee on, and will cause thee to come up from the far north, and will bring thee upon the harim of Yisroel;"
Yechezkel,39,3,"And I will knock thy keshet out of thy left hand, and will cause thine khitzim to fall out of thy right hand."
Yechezkel,39,4,"Thou shalt fall upon the harim of Yisroel, thou, and all thy troops, and the peoples with thee; I will give thee unto the birds of prey of every sort, and to the beasts of the sadeh to be devoured."
Yechezkel,39,5,"Thou shalt fall upon the open sadeh; for I have spoken it, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,39,6,"And I will send an eish on Magog, and among them that dwell complacently secure in the coastlands; and they shall know that I am Hashem."
Yechezkel,39,7,"So will I make Shem Kodshi (Name of My Holiness, Holy Name) known in the midst of My people Yisroel; and I will not let them profane Shem Kodshi (Name of My Holiness, Holy Name) any more: and the Goyim shall know that I am Hashem Kadosh b'Yisroel."
Yechezkel,39,8,"Hinei, it is coming, and it shall be done, saith Adonoi Hashem ; this is the day whereof I have spoken."
Yechezkel,39,9,"And they that dwell in the towns of Yisroel shall go forth, and shall use for fuel and set on fire the weapons, both the mogen and the bucklers, the keshet and the khitzim, and the clubs, and the spears, and they shall burn them with eish sheva shanim;"
Yechezkel,39,10,"So that they shall take no wood [for fuel] out of the sadeh, neither cut down any out of the forests; for they shall burn the weapons with eish; and they shall plunder those that plundered them, and pillage those that looted them, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,39,11,"And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto Gog a makom kever (burial place) there in Yisroel — the valley of those who pass by, east of the yam; and it shall block the path of the passersby; and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude; and they shall call it Gey Hamon Gog."
Yechezkel,39,12,"And seven months shall Bais Yisroel be burying them, that they may make ha'aretz tahor."
Yechezkel,39,13,"Indeed, kol Am Ha'Aretz shall bury them; and it shall give them renown the day that I shall be glorified, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,39,14,"And they shall set apart anshei tamid (a regular detail of men) to work at passing through ha'aretz to bury those passing through, those bodies remaining upon the face of ha'aretz, to make it tahor; for the whole of seven months shall they make the search."
Yechezkel,39,15,"And the ones passing through ha'aretz, when any seeth an etzem adam (human bone) , then shall he build a tziyun (marker) beside it, until the mekabberim (buriers) have buried it in the Gey Hamon Gog."
Yechezkel,39,16,And also the shem of the Ir shall be Hamonah. Thus shall they make ha'aretz tahor.
Yechezkel,39,17,"And, thou ben adam, thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Speak unto every feathered fowl, and to every beast of the sadeh, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to My zevach (sacrificial feast) that I do sacrifice for you, even a Zevach Gadol upon the harim of Yisroel, that ye may eat basar, and drink dahm."
Yechezkel,39,18,"Ye shall eat the basar gibborim, and drink the dahm of the nasi'im of ha'aretz, as of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bulls, all of them fatlings of Bashan."
Yechezkel,39,19,"And ye shall eat chelev until ye be glutted, and drink dahm until ye be shikkaron, from My Zevach which I have sacrificed for you."
Yechezkel,39,20,"Thus ye shall be filled at My shulchan with susim and riders, with gibbor, and with all ish hamilchamah, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,39,21,"And I will set My Kavod among the Goyim, and kol HaGoyim shall see My mishpat that I have executed, and My yad that I have laid upon them."
Yechezkel,39,22,So Bais Yisroel shall know that I am Hashem Eloheihem from that day and forward.
Yechezkel,39,23,"And the Goyim shall know that Bais Yisroel went into the Golus for their avon; because they were unfaithful to Me; therefore hid I My face from them, and gave them into the yad of their enemies; so fell they all by the cherev."
Yechezkel,39,24,"According to their tumah and according to their peysha'im have I dealt with them, and hid My face from them."
Yechezkel,39,25,"Therefore thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Now will I bring back the captives of Ya'akov, and have compassion upon kol Bais Yisroel, and will be jealous for Shem Kodshi (Name of My Holiness, Holy Name);"
Yechezkel,39,26,"After that they have borne their shame, and all their unfaithfulness whereby they have been unfaithful against Me, when they dwelt securely in their adamah, and none made them afraid."
Yechezkel,39,27,"When I have brought them back from the nations, and regathered them out of the lands of their oyevim, and am set apart as kodesh through them in the sight of Goyim rabbim;"
Yechezkel,39,28,"Then shall they know that I am Hashem Eloheihem, Who caused them to be led into the Golus among the Goyim; but I have regathered them unto their own adamah (land) , and have left none of them behind any more in the Golus."
Yechezkel,39,29,"Neither will I hide My face any more from them; for I have poured out My Ruach upon Bais Yisroel, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,40,1,"In the five and twentieth year of our Golus, in the rosh hashanah, in the tenth day of the month in the fourteenth year after the fall of the Ir, in the selfsame day the Yad Hashem was upon me, and brought me there."
Yechezkel,40,2,"In the marot Elohim (visions of G-d, Divine visions) He brought me to Eretz Yisroel, and set me upon a very high mountain, on which was a mivneh (structure) resembling an ir to the negev (south)."
Yechezkel,40,3,"And He brought me there, and, hinei, there was an ish, whose appearance was like the appearance of nechoshet, with a cord of linen in his yad, and a keneh hamiddah (measuring rod) ; and he stood in the sha'ar."
Yechezkel,40,4,"And the ish said unto me, Ben Adam, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thine lev upon all that I shall show thee; for l'ma'an (to the intent, in order that) I might show them unto thee art thou brought here; declare all that thou seest to Bais Yisroel."
Yechezkel,40,5,"And, hinei, a chomah (wall) was on the outside of the Bais compound and was surrounding it, and in the yad of the ish was a keneh hamiddah of six long cubits, each a cubit and a handbreadth; so he measured the thickness of the structure, one rod; and the wallʼs height, one rod."
Yechezkel,40,6,"Then came he unto the sha'ar (gateway) which faceth eastward, and went up the ma'alot (steps, stairs) thereof, and measured the saf (threshold) of the sha'ar, which was one rod deep;"
Yechezkel,40,7,"And every ta (recess) was one rod wide, and one rod deep; and between the ta'im (rooms) were five cubits; and the saf (threshold) of the sha'ar next to the ulam of the sha'ar on the inside was one rod."
Yechezkel,40,8,"He measured also the ulam of the sha'ar on the inside, one rod."
Yechezkel,40,9,"Then he measured the ulam of the sha'ar, eight cubits; and the jambs thereof, two cubits; and the ulam of the sha'ar was on the inside."
Yechezkel,40,10,"And the ta'im of the sha'ar eastward were shloshah on this side, and shloshah on that side; they three were of the same measurement; and the jambs had the same measurement on this side and on that side."
Yechezkel,40,11,"And he measured the width of the petach (opening) of the sha'ar, ten cubits; and the length of the sha'ar, thirteen cubits."
Yechezkel,40,12,"The boundary line also before the ta'ot (recesses) was one cubit on this side, one cubit on that side; and the ta were six cubits deep on this side, and six cubits on that side."
Yechezkel,40,13,He measured then the sha'ar from the ceiling of one ta to the ceiling of another; the width was five and twenty cubits; petach was opposite to petach.
Yechezkel,40,14,"He made [measurement] of the ulam, threescore cubits, even unto the jamb of the khatzer at the sha'ar all around."
Yechezkel,40,15,"And from the front of the sha'ar, the outer side, unto the front of the interior ulam vestibule was fifty cubits."
Yechezkel,40,16,"And there were chalonot atumot (closed niches) for the ta'im, the sha'ar and for their side walls and these were interior of the sha'ar all around, and likewise the ulam vestibules: and chalonot were round about on the inside; and upon each jamb were timorim (palm trees)."
Yechezkel,40,17,"Then he brought me into the khatzer hakhitzonah (outer courtyard) , and, hinei, there were leshakhot (chambers) , and ritzpah (pavement) constructed for the khatzer (courtyard) all around; thirty leshakhot were along the ritzpah."
Yechezkel,40,18,"And the ritzpah was by the side of the she'arim running the length of the she'arim, the lower ritzpah."
Yechezkel,40,19,"Then he measured the width from the forefront of the lower sha'ar unto the forefront of the khatzer hapenimi (inner courtyard) on its outside, a hundred cubits eastward and northward."
Yechezkel,40,20,"And the sha'ar of the khatzer hakhitzonah that looked toward the north, he measured the length thereof, and the width thereof."
Yechezkel,40,21,"And the ta'im thereof were shloshah on this side and shloshah on that side; and the jambs thereof and the ulam thereof were after the measure of the first sha'ar; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the width five and twenty cubits."
Yechezkel,40,22,"And their chalonot, and their ulam vestibules, and their timorim, had the same measurements as the sha'ar that looketh toward the east; and they went up unto it by ma'alot sheva; and the ulam thereof were before them."
Yechezkel,40,23,"And the sha'ar of the khatzer hapenimi (inner courtyard) was facing toward the north, and toward the east; and he measured from sha'ar to sha'ar a hundred cubits."
Yechezkel,40,24,"After that he brought me toward the south, and, hinei, a sha'ar toward the south; and he measured the jambs thereof and the ulam vestibules thereof according to these measures."
Yechezkel,40,25,"And there were chalonim in it and in the ulam vestibule thereof round about, like those chalonot; the length was fifty cubits, and the width five and twenty cubits."
Yechezkel,40,26,"And there were ma'alot shivah (seven steps, stairs) to go up to it, and the ulam vestibule thereof were before them; and it had timorim, one on this side, and another on that side, upon the jambs thereof."
Yechezkel,40,27,And there was a sha'ar in the khatzer hapenimi toward the south; and he measured from sha'ar to sha'ar toward the south a hundred cubits.
Yechezkel,40,28,And he brought me to the khatzer hapenimi through the south sha'ar; and he measured the south sha'ar according to these measures;
Yechezkel,40,29,"And the ta'im thereof, and the jambs thereof, and the ulam vestibule thereof, according to these measures; and there were chalonot in it and in the ulam vestibule thereof round about; it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits wide."
Yechezkel,40,30,"And the ulam vestibules round about were five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits wide."
Yechezkel,40,31,"And the ulam vestibules thereof were facing the khatzer hachatzonah (the outer courtyard) ; and timorim were upon the jambs thereof; and the going up to it had ma'alot shmoneh (eight steps, stairs)."
Yechezkel,40,32,And he brought me into the khatzer hapenimi toward the east; and he measured the sha'ar according to these measures.
Yechezkel,40,33,"And the ta'im thereof, and the jambs thereof, and the ulam vestibule thereof, were according to these measures; and there were chalonot therein and in the ulam vestibule thereof round about; it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits wide."
Yechezkel,40,34,"And the ulam vestibule thereof was toward the khatzer hakhitzonah; and timorim were upon the jambs thereof, on this side, and on that side; and the going up to it had ma'alot shmoneh."
Yechezkel,40,35,"And he brought me to the northern sha'ar, and measured it according to these measures:"
Yechezkel,40,36,"The ta'im thereof, the jambs thereof, and the ulam vestibules thereof, and the chalonot to it round about; the length was fifty cubits, and the width five and twenty cubits."
Yechezkel,40,37,"And the jambs thereof were toward the khatzer hakhitzonah; and timorim were upon the jambs thereof, on this side, and on that side; and the going up to it had ma'alot shmoneh."
Yechezkel,40,38,"And the lishka and the entryways thereof were by the ulam vestibules of the she'arim, where they washed the olah (burnt offering)."
Yechezkel,40,39,"And in the ulam of the sha'ar were two shulchanot (tables) on this side, and two shulchanot on that side, to slaughter thereon the olah and the chattat and the asham."
Yechezkel,40,40,"And at the side outside, as one goeth up to the petach hasha'ar hatzafonah, were two shulchanot; and on the other side, which was at the ulam of the sha'ar, were two shulchanot."
Yechezkel,40,41,"Four shulchanot were on this side, and four shulchanot on that side, by the side of the sha'ar; eight shulchanot, whereupon they slaughtered [shachat]."
Yechezkel,40,42,"And the four shulchanot were of hewn stone for the olah (burnt offering) , of a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half wide, and one cubit high; whereupon also they placed the kelim wherewith they slaughtered the olah (burnt offering) and the zevach."
Yechezkel,40,43,"And within were hooks, one handbreadth, set up inside all around; and upon the shulchanot was the basar of the korban."
Yechezkel,40,44,"And outside the sha'ar hapenimi were the lishkhot of the sharim (singers) in the khatzer hapenimi, which was at the side of the northern sha'ar; and their view was toward the south; one at the side of the eastern sha'ar having the view toward the north."
Yechezkel,40,45,"And he said unto me, This lishka, whose view is toward the south, is for the Kohanim, the Shomrei Mishmeret HaBeis."
Yechezkel,40,46,"And the lishka whose view is toward the north is for the Kohanim, the Shomrei Mishmeret HaMizbe'ach; these are the Bnei Tzadok among the Bnei Levi, which come near to Hashem to minister unto Him."
Yechezkel,40,47,"So he measured the khatzer (court) , a hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits wide, foursquare; and the Mizbe'ach was before the Beis."
Yechezkel,40,48,"And he brought me to the Ulam of the Beis, and measured each jamb of the Ulam, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side; and the width of the sha'ar was shalosh cubits on this side, and shalosh cubits on that side."
Yechezkel,40,49,"The length of the Ulam was twenty cubits, and the width eleven cubits, and he brought me by the ma'alot whereby they went up to it; and there were ammudim (pillars) by the doorposts, one on this side, and another on that side."
Yechezkel,41,1,"Afterward he brought me to the Heikhal, and measured the jambs, six cubits wide on the one side, and six cubits wide on the other side, which was the width of the Ohel."
Yechezkel,41,2,"And the width of the Petach (Entrance) was ten cubits; and the ketefot (shoulders, sidewalls) of the Petach were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side; and he measured the depth thereof, forty cubits; and the width, twenty cubits."
Yechezkel,41,3,"Then he went into the Penimah (the Innermost ), and measured the jamb of the Petach, two cubits; and the Petach, six cubits; and the width of the Petach, sheva (seven) cubits."
Yechezkel,41,4,"So he measured the depth thereof, twenty cubits; and the width, twenty cubits, along the Heikhal; and he said unto me, This is the Kodesh HaKodashim."
Yechezkel,41,5,"After he measured the wall of the Beis, six cubits; and the width of every tzela (side chamber, cell) , four cubits, around the Beis on every side."
Yechezkel,41,6,"And the tzela'ot (side chambers, cells) were tzela over tzela, thirty-three in number; and there were ledges on the wall which was of the Beis for the tzela'ot round about, that they might take hold there, but they had not hold in the wall of the Beis."
Yechezkel,41,7,"And tzela'ot (side chambers, cells) were broader at each story; a ramp spiraled upward by stages around the Beis; therefore the width of the Beis increased as it went upward, so from the lowest to the highest through the middle."
Yechezkel,41,8,I saw also the height of the Beis all around; the yesodot (foundations) of the tzela'ot were a full rod of six cubits long.
Yechezkel,41,9,"The thickness of the wall, which was for the tzela toward the outside, was five cubits; and that which was open was the space at the end of the tzela'ot of the Beis."
Yechezkel,41,10,And between the leshakhot was the space the width of twenty cubits around the Beis all around.
Yechezkel,41,11,"And the petach of the tzela were toward the space that was open, one petach toward the north, and another petach toward the south; and the width of the place that was open was five cubits all around."
Yechezkel,41,12,"Now the Binyan (building, structure) that was before the Gizrah (separation, separating courtyard, restricted space, behind the Beis HaMikdash) at the end toward the west was seventy cubits wide; and the wall of the Binyan was five cubits thick all around, and the length thereof ninety cubits."
Yechezkel,41,13,"So he measured the Beis, a hundred cubits long; and the Gizrah, and the Binyan, with the walls thereof, a hundred cubits long;"
Yechezkel,41,14,"Also the width of the face of the Beis, and of the Gizrah toward the east, a hundred cubits."
Yechezkel,41,15,"And he measured the length of the Binyan along the front of the Gizrah which was behind it, and the atikeha (corner structures) thereof on the one side and on the other side, a hundred cubits, with the Heikhal Hapenimi, and the ulam vestibules of the Khatzer;"
Yechezkel,41,16,"The doorposts, and the narrow chalonim, and the atikim balconies around on their three stories, opposite the saf (threshold) , paneled with etz all around, and from the ground up to the chalonot, and the chalonot were covered;"
Yechezkel,41,17,"To that above the Petach, even unto the Beis HaPenimi, and at the outside, and by the wall all around penimi (inner) and khitzon (outer) , by measure."
Yechezkel,41,18,"And it was carved with keruvim and timorim, so that a palm tree was between a keruv and a keruv; and every keruv had two faces;"
Yechezkel,41,19,"So that the face of an adam was toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side; it was carved throughout kol HaBeis all around."
Yechezkel,41,20,"From the ground unto above the Petach were keruvim and timorim carved, and on the wall of the Heikhal."
Yechezkel,41,21,"The mezuzas of the Heikhal were squared; as for the front of the Kodesh [HaKodashim], the appearance of the one [mezuzah] was like the appearance of the other."
Yechezkel,41,22,"The Mizbe'ach was of etz and was three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the sides thereof, were of etz; and he said unto me, This is the shulchan that is before Hashem."
Yechezkel,41,23,And the Heikhal and the Kodesh had two delatot.
Yechezkel,41,24,"And the delatot had two doors apiece, two turning doors; two delatot for the one door, and two delatot for the other door."
Yechezkel,41,25,"And there were carved on them, on the delatot of the Heikhal, keruvim and timorim, like those carved upon the walls; and there was a beam upon the face of the Ulam at the outside."
Yechezkel,41,26,"And there were narrow chalonim and timorim on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the Ulam, and upon the tzela'ot of the Beis, and thick beams."
Yechezkel,42,1,"Then he brought me forth into the khatzer hakhatzonah, the way toward the north; and he brought me into the lishka that was opposite the Gizrah, and which was opposite the Binyan toward the north."
Yechezkel,42,2,"Before the length of a hundred cubits was the Petach HaTzafon, and the width was fifty cubits."
Yechezkel,42,3,"Opposite the twenty cubits of the khatzer hapenimah, and opposite the ritzpah which was for the khatzer hakhitzonah, was atik (balcony) against atik in three stories."
Yechezkel,42,4,"And before the leshakhot was a mahalach (walkway) ten cubits in width leading inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north."
Yechezkel,42,5,"Now the upper leshakhot were narrow; for the atikim took space from these, from the lower, and from the middlemost of the Binyan."
Yechezkel,42,6,"For they were in three stories, but had not ammudim like the ammudim of the khatzerot; therefore they were set back from the ground more than the lowest and the middlemost."
Yechezkel,42,7,"And the wall that was outside over against the leshakhot, toward the khatzer hakhitzonah on the forepart of the leshakhot, the length thereof was fifty cubits."
Yechezkel,42,8,"For the length of the leshakhot that were in the khatzer hakhitzonah was fifty cubits; and, hineh, before the Heikhal were a hundred cubits."
Yechezkel,42,9,"And from below these leshakhot was the entrance on the east side, as one goeth into them from the khatzer hakhitzonah."
Yechezkel,42,10,"In the thickness of the wall of the khatzer toward the east, facing the Gizrah, and over against the Binyan, were leshakhot (side rooms)."
Yechezkel,42,11,"And the derech before them was like the appearance of the leshakhot which were toward the north, as long as they, and as wide as they; and all their exits were both according to their arrangements, and according to their doorways."
Yechezkel,42,12,"And according to the doorways of the leshakhot that were toward the south was a petach in the rosh of the derech, even the derech directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them."
Yechezkel,42,13,"Then said he unto me, The leshakhot hatzafon and the leshakhot hadarom, which are before the Gizrah, they are leshakhot hakodesh, where the Kohanim that approach unto Hashem shall eat the kadshei hakadashim; there shall they put the kadshei hakadashim, and the minchah, and the chattat, and the asham (trespass offering) ; for the place is kadosh."
Yechezkel,42,14,"When the Kohanim enter therein, then shall they not go out of the Kodesh into the khatzer hakhitzonah, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they are kodesh; and shall put on begadim acherim (other garments) ; then shall they approach the precinct of the people."
Yechezkel,42,15,"Now when he had made an end of measuring the Beis HaPenimi, he brought me forth toward the sha'ar whose view is toward the east, and measured it all around."
Yechezkel,42,16,"He measured the eastern side with the measuring rod, five hundred rods, with the keneh hamiddah (measuring rod) all around."
Yechezkel,42,17,"He measured the northern side, five hundred rods, with the keneh hamiddah all around."
Yechezkel,42,18,"He measured the southern side, five hundred rods, with the keneh hamiddah."
Yechezkel,42,19,"He turned about to the western side, and measured five hundred rods with the keneh hamiddah."
Yechezkel,42,20,"He measured it by the four sides; it had a wall all around, five hundred rods long, and five hundred wide, lehavdil (to make a separation) between the Kodesh (Holy Precinct, area) and the Chol (Common Precinct, area)."
Yechezkel,43,1,"Afterward he brought me to the sha'ar, even the sha'ar that looketh toward the east;"
Yechezkel,43,2,"And, hinei, the Kavod Elohei Yisroel came from the derech of the east; and His voice was like a kol mayim rabbim and ha'aretz was radiant with His Kavod."
Yechezkel,43,3,"And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when He came to destroy the Ir; and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the Nahar Kevar; and I fell upon my face."
Yechezkel,43,4,And the Kavod Hashem came into the Beis by the derech of the sha'ar whose view is toward the east.
Yechezkel,43,5,"So the Ruach lifted me up, and brought me into the khatzer hapenimi and, hinei, the Kavod Hashem filled the Beis."
Yechezkel,43,6,And I heard Him speaking unto me out of the Beis; and the ish was standing beside me.
Yechezkel,43,7,"And He said unto me, Ben Adam, this is the makom (place, home) of My Kisse, and the makom of the soles of My feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the Bnei Yisroel l'olam, and My Shem Kadosh, shall Bais Yisroel no more make tameh, neither they, nor their melachim, by their zenut (whoredom) , nor by the pegarim (buried dead bodies) of their melachim in their high places."
Yechezkel,43,8,"In their setting of their threshold by My threshold, and their mezuzah by My mezuzah, and the wall between Me and them, they have even made tameh My Shem Kodesh by their to'evot that they have committed; therefore I have consumed them in Mine anger."
Yechezkel,43,9,"Now let them put away their zenut (whoredom) , and the pegarim (buried dead bodies) of their melachim, far from Me, and I will dwell in the midst of them l'olam."
Yechezkel,43,10,"Thou Ben Adam, declare the Beis to Bais Yisroel, that they may be ashamed of their avonot; and let them measure the tachnit (perfection, design)."
Yechezkel,43,11,"And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the tzurah (form, fashion) of the Beis, and the techunah (arrangement) thereof, and the exits thereof, and the entrances thereof, and all the tzurot thereof, and all the chukkot thereof, and all the tzurot thereof, and all the torot thereof; and write it before their eyes, that they may be shomer over the whole tzurah thereof, and all the chukkot thereof, and do them."
Yechezkel,43,12,"This is the torat HaBeis: upon the rosh hahar the entire boundary thereof round about shall be kodesh kadashim. Hinei, this is the torat HaBeis."
Yechezkel,43,13,"And these are the middot HaMizbe'ach (measurements of the Mizbe'ach) in cubits. The cubit is a cubit and a handbreadth; even the base shall be a cubit (in height) , and the width a cubit, and the moulding thereof by the edge thereof round about shall be a span; and this shall be for the gav (height, back) of the Mizbe'ach."
Yechezkel,43,14,"And from the base upon ha'aretz even to the lower enclosure shall be two cubits, and the width one cubit; and from the lesser enclosure even to the greater enclosure shall be four cubits, and the width one cubit."
Yechezkel,43,15,"So the ariel (surface of the altar, hearth) shall be four cubits; and from the hearth and upward shall be four keranot (horns)."
Yechezkel,43,16,"And the hearth shall be square, twelve cubits long, by twelve wide."
Yechezkel,43,17,"And the enclosure shall be square, fourteen cubits long and fourteen wide; and the moulding about it shall be half a cubit; and the base thereof shall be a cubit about; and its ma'alot (steps, stairs) shall look toward the east."
Yechezkel,43,18,"And He said unto me, Ben Adam, thus saith Adonoi Hashem : These are the chukkot HaMizbe'ach in the Yom when they shall build it, to offer olah thereon, and to sprinkle dahm thereon."
Yechezkel,43,19,"And thou shalt give to the Kohanim the Levi'im that are of the Zera Tzadok, which approach unto Me, to minister unto Me, saith Adonoi Hashem , a young bull for a chattat."
Yechezkel,43,20,"And thou shalt take of the dahm thereof, and put it on the four karnot of it, and on the four pinnot of the enclosure, and upon the moulding round about; thus shalt thou cleanse and make kapporah for it."
Yechezkel,43,21,"Thou shalt take the bull also of the chattat, and shall burn it in the mifkad (appointed place) of the Beis, outside the Mikdash."
Yechezkel,43,22,"And on the second day thou shalt offer a male of the goats tamim (without blemish) for a chattat; and they shall purify the Mitzbe'ach, as they did purify it with the bull."
Yechezkel,43,23,"When thou hast made an end of purifying it, thou shalt offer a young bull tamim (without blemish) , and a ram out of the tzon (flock) tamim (without blemish)."
Yechezkel,43,24,"And thou shalt offer them before Hashem , and the Kohanim shall cast melach upon them, and they shall offer them up for an olah unto Hashem."
Yechezkel,43,25,"Shivat yamim shalt thou prepare daily a se'ir (goat) for a chattat; they shall also prepare a young bull, and a ram out of the tzon (flock) , temimim (ones without blemish)."
Yechezkel,43,26,Shivat yamim shall they make kapporah for the Mizbe'ach and make it tahor and so consecrate it.
Yechezkel,43,27,"And when these yamim are expired, it shall be, that upon the Yom HaShemini, and so forward, the Kohanim shall make your olot upon the Mizbe'ach, and your Shelamim; and I will accept you, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,44,1,"Then he brought me back the derech sha'ar HaMikdash HaKhitzon, which looketh toward the east; and it was shut."
Yechezkel,44,2,"Then said Hashem unto me: This sha'ar shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no ish shall enter in by it; because Hashem Elohei Yisroel, hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut."
Yechezkel,44,3,"It is for the Nasi; the Nasi, he only shall sit in it to eat lechem before Hashem ; he shall enter by the derech ulam hasha'ar, and shall exit by its derech."
Yechezkel,44,4,"Then he brought me the derech sha'ar hatzafon to the front of the Beis; and I looked, and, hinei, the Kavod Hashem filled the Beis Hashem ; and I fell upon my face."
Yechezkel,44,5,"And Hashem said unto me, Ben Adam, mark well, and behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say unto thee concerning all the chukkot Beis Hashem , and all the torot thereof; and mark well the entrances of the Beis, with every exit of the Mikdash."
Yechezkel,44,6,"And thou shalt say to the meri (rebellious) , even to the Bais Yisroel, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem ; O ye Bais Yisroel, let it suffice you of all your to'avot (abominations),"
Yechezkel,44,7,"In that ye have admitted into My Mikdash bnei nechor (foreigners) , arelim in lev, and arelim in basar, to be in My Mikdash, to defile it, even My Beis, when ye offer My lechem, the chelev and the dahm, and they have broken My Brit (Covenant) because of all your to'avot (abominations)."
Yechezkel,44,8,And ye have not been shomer over the mishmeret of Mine Kadashim; but ye have set as shomrim of My mishmeret in My Mikdash any for yourselves.
Yechezkel,44,9,"Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : No ben nechor, arel lev, nor arel basar, shall enter into My Mikdash, of any ben nechor that is among the Bnei Yisroel."
Yechezkel,44,10,"And the Levi'im that went far away from Me, when Yisroel went astray, which went astray away from Me after their gillulim (idols) ; they shall even bear their avon."
Yechezkel,44,11,"Yet they shall be mesharetim (ministers) in My Mikdash, pekuddot (the ones who have charge) at the Sha'arei HaBeis and mesharetim in HaBeis; they shall do the shochet slaughter of the olah (burnt offering) and the zevach for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister unto them."
Yechezkel,44,12,"Because they ministered unto them before their gillulim, and caused Bais Yisroel a michshol avon; therefore have I lifted up Mine Yad against them, saith Adonoi Hashem , and nas'u (they shall bear) their avon."
Yechezkel,44,13,"And they shall not come near unto Me, to do the office of a Kohen unto Me, nor to come near to any of My kadashim, in the Kodesh HaKodashim; but nas'u their shame, and their to'avot which they have committed."
Yechezkel,44,14,"But I will make them Shomrei Meshmeret HaBeis, for all the avodah thereof, and for all that shall be done therein."
Yechezkel,44,15,"But the Kohanim the Levi'im, the Bnei Tzadok, that were shomer over the Mishmeret of My Mikdash when the Bnei Yisroel went astray from Me, they shall come near to Me to minister unto Me, and they shall stand before Me to offer unto Me the chelev and the dahm, saith Adonoi Hashem;"
Yechezkel,44,16,"They shall enter into My Mikdash, and they shall come near to My Shulchan, to minister unto Me, and they shall be shomer over My mishmeret."
Yechezkel,44,17,"And it shall come to pass, when they enter in at the Sha'arei HeKhatzer HaPenimit, they shall be clothed with linen; and no tzemer shall come upon them, while they minister at the Sha'arei HeKhatzer HaPenimit, within."
Yechezkel,44,18,"They shall have linen turbans upon their rosh, and shall have linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird themselves with that with which one perspires."
Yechezkel,44,19,"And when they go forth into HaKhatzer HaKhitzonah, even into the Khatzer HaKhitzonah to HaAm, they shall take off their garments wherein they ministered, and lay them in the lishkhot hakodesh (holy chambers) and they shall put on begadim acharim; and they shall not set apart as kodesh HaAm with their begadim."
Yechezkel,44,20,"Neither shall they shave their rosh, nor allow their hair to grow long; they shall keep trimmed their rosh."
Yechezkel,44,21,"Neither shall any Kohen drink yayin, when they enter into the Khatzer HaPenimit."
Yechezkel,44,22,"Neither shall they take for their nashim an almanah, nor a gerushah; but they shall take betulot of the zera Bais Yisroel, or an almanah who was almanah of a Kohen."
Yechezkel,44,23,"And they shall teach My people the difference between the kodesh and chol, and cause them to discern between the tameh and the tahor."
Yechezkel,44,24,And in a riv they shall stand as shofet; and they shall judge it according to My mishpatim; and they shall adjudicate them in accordance with My torot and My chukkot in all Mine mo'adim; and they shall be shomer to keep My Shabbatot kodesh.
Yechezkel,44,25,"And they shall come near no met adam to make themselves tameh; but for av, or for em, or for ben, or for bat, for ach, or for achot that hath had no ish, they may make themselves tameh."
Yechezkel,44,26,"And after he is made tahor, they shall reckon unto him shivat yamim."
Yechezkel,44,27,"And in the yom that he goeth into the Kodesh, unto the Khatzer HaPenimit, to minister in the Kodesh, he shall offer his chattat, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,44,28,And it shall be unto them for a nachalah; I am their nachalah; and ye shall give them no achuzzah in Yisroel; I am their achuzzah.
Yechezkel,44,29,"They shall eat the minchah, and the chattat, and the asham; and kol cherem in Yisroel shall be theirs."
Yechezkel,44,30,"And the reshit kol bikkurim of all things, and every terumah of all, of every sort of your terumot, shall belong to the Kohanim; ye shall also give unto the Kohen the reshit of your dough, that he may cause the brocha to rest on thine bais."
Yechezkel,44,31,"The Kohanim shall not eat of any thing nevelah, or terefah, whether it be oph or behemah."
Yechezkel,45,1,"Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot HaAretz as nachalah, ye shall offer a terumah (holy portion, gift) unto Hashem , kodesh from HaAretz; the length shall be five and twenty thousand long, and the width shall be ten thousand. This shall be kodesh in all the boundary thereof round about."
Yechezkel,45,2,Of this area there shall be for the Kodesh a square five hundred by five hundred all around; and fifty cubits round about for the migrash (open space) thereof.
Yechezkel,45,3,"And of this middah shalt thou measure the length of five and twenty thousand, and the width of ten thousand; and in it shall be the Mikdash and the Kodesh HaKodashim."
Yechezkel,45,4,"The kodesh of HaAretz shall be for the Kohanim the Mesharetim of the Mikdash, which shall come near to minister unto Hashem ; and it shall be a place for their batim (houses) , and a mikdash for the Mikdash."
Yechezkel,45,5,"And the five and twenty thousand of length, and the ten thousand of width shall also the Levi'im, the Mesharetim of the Beis, have for themselves, for a achuzzah for twenty leshakhot."
Yechezkel,45,6,"And ye shall allot the achuzzah of the Ir five thousand wide, and five and twenty thousand long, alongside the terumat hakodesh; it shall be for kol Bais Yisroel."
Yechezkel,45,7,"And a portion shall be for the Nasi on the one side and on the other side of the terumat hakodesh, and of the achuzzah of the Ir, before the terumat hakodesh, and before the achuzzah of the Ir, from the west side westward, and from the east side eastward; and the length shall correspond to one of the chalakim (portions), from the west boundary unto the east boundary."
Yechezkel,45,8,"In the land shall be his achuzzah in Yisroel; and My Nasiim (Princes, Rulers) shall no more oppress My people; and the rest of HaAretz shall they give to Bais Yisroel according to their Shivtei."
Yechezkel,45,9,"Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : Let it suffice you, O Nasi'im (Princes, Rulers) of Yisroel: remove chamas and oppression, and execute mishpat and tzedakah, take away your gerushot (exactions) from My people, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,45,10,"Ye shall have me'oznei tzedek (honest scales) , and an ephah tzedek, and a bas tzedek."
Yechezkel,45,11,"The ephah and the bas shall be of one measure, that the bas may contain the tenth part of a chomer, and the ephah the tenth part of a chomer; the measure thereof shall be after the chomer."
Yechezkel,45,12,"And the shekel shall be twenty gerah; twenty shekalim, five and twenty shekalim, fifteen shekel, shall be the minah for you."
Yechezkel,45,13,"This is the terumah that ye shall offer; the sixth part of an ephah of a chomer of chittim, and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah of a chomer of se'orim;"
Yechezkel,45,14,"Concerning the chok of shemen, the bas of shemen, ye shall offer the tenth part of a bas out of the cor, which is a chomer of ten bas; for ten basim are a chomer;"
Yechezkel,45,15,"And one seh out of the tzon, out of two hundred, out of the mashkeh of Yisroel; for a minchah, and for an olah, and for shelamim, to make kapporah for them, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yechezkel,45,16,Kol HaAm HaAretz shall give this terumah for the Nasi in Yisroel.
Yechezkel,45,17,"And it shall be the part of the Nasi to give olot, and minchah, and nesekh, in the Chagim, and in the Rosh Chodesh, and in the Shabbatot, in all Mo'adim of the Bais Yisroel; he shall prepare the chattat, and the minchah, and the olah, and the shelamim, to make kapporah for Bais Yisroel."
Yechezkel,45,18,"Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : In the first month, in the first day of the month, thou shalt take a young bull tamim (without blemish) , and cleanse the Mikdash;"
Yechezkel,45,19,"And the Kohen shall take of the dahm of the chattat, and put it upon the mezuzat HaBeis, and upon the four pinnot of the enclosure of the Mizbe'ach, and upon the mezuzat Sha'ar HeKhatzer HaPenimit."
Yechezkel,45,20,"And so thou shalt do the seventh day of the month for every one that is unwitting, and for him that is ignorant; so shall ye make kapporah for the Beis."
Yechezkel,45,21,"In the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall have the Pesach, a Chag shevu'ot yamim; matzot shall be eaten."
Yechezkel,45,22,And upon that day shall the Nasi prepare for himself and for kol Am HaAretz a bull for a chattat.
Yechezkel,45,23,"And shivat yamim of the Chag he shall prepare an olah to Hashem , seven bulls and seven rams temimim (without blemish) daily the shivat hayamim; and a goat daily for a chattat."
Yechezkel,45,24,"And he shall prepare a minchah of an ephah for a bull, and an ephah for a ram, and a hin of shemen for an ephah."
Yechezkel,45,25,"In the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of the month, shall he do the same in the Chag of the shivat hayamim, according to the chattat, according to the olah, and according to the minchah, and according to the shemen."
Yechezkel,46,1,"Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : The Sha'ar HeKhatzer HaPenimit that looketh toward the east shall be shut during the sheshet yemei hama'aseh (the six days of labor) ; but on Shabbos it shall be opened, and in the yom of the Rosh Chodesh it shall be opened."
Yechezkel,46,2,"And the Nasi shall enter by the derech ulam haSha'ar from without, and shall stand by the mezuzat HaSha'ar, and the Kohanim shall prepare his Olah (burnt offering) and his Shelamim, and he shall worship at the threshold of the Sha'ar; then he shall go out; but the Sha'ar shall not be shut until the erev."
Yechezkel,46,3,Likewise the Am HaAretz shall worship at the Petach HaSha'ar before Hashem in the Shabbatot and in Rosh Chodesh.
Yechezkel,46,4,"And the Olah that the Nasi shall offer unto Hashem in the Yom HaShabbos shall be six kevasim temimim, and a ram without blemish."
Yechezkel,46,5,"And the minchah shall be an ephah for a ram, and the minchah for the kevasim whatever his hand gives, and a hin of shemen to an ephah."
Yechezkel,46,6,"And in the yom of the Rosh Chodesh it shall be a young bull temimim, and six kevasim, and a ram; they shall be without blemish."
Yechezkel,46,7,"And he shall prepare a minchah, an ephah for a bull, and an ephah for a ram, and for the kevasim as much as he wishes, and a hin of shemen to an ephah."
Yechezkel,46,8,"And when the Nasi shall enter, he shall go in by the derech ulam HaSha'ar and he shall go out by the derech thereof."
Yechezkel,46,9,"But when the Am HaAretz shall come before Hashem in the Mo'adim, he that entereth in by the derech Sha'ar Tzafon to worship shall exit by the derech Sha'ar Negev; and he that entereth by the derech Sha'ar Negev shall go out by derech Sha'ar Tzafonah; he shall not return by the derech HaSha'ar whereby he came in, but shall go out opposite it."
Yechezkel,46,10,"And the Nasi in the midst of them, when they go in, shall go in; and when they go out, shall go out."
Yechezkel,46,11,"And in the Chagim and in the Mo'adim the minchah shall be an ephah to a bull, and an ephah to a ram, and to the kevasim as much as one wishes to give, and a hin of shemen to an ephah."
Yechezkel,46,12,"Now when the Nasi shall prepare a nedavah olah or shelamim nedavah unto Hashem , one shall then open for him the Sha'ar that looketh toward the east, and he shall prepare his Olah and his Shelamim, as he did on the Yom HaShabbos; then he shall go out; and after his going out one shall shut the Sha'ar."
Yechezkel,46,13,Thou shalt daily prepare an Olah unto Hashem of a keves of the first year tamim (without blemish) ; thou shalt prepare it baboker baboker.
Yechezkel,46,14,"And thou shalt prepare a Minchah for it baboker baboker, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of a hin of shemen, to moisten with the fine flour; a minchah chukkot olam tamid unto Hashem."
Yechezkel,46,15,"Thus shall they prepare the keves, and the minchah, and the shemen, baboker baboker for an olat tamid."
Yechezkel,46,16,"Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : If the Nasi give a mattanah (gift) unto any of his banim, the nachalah thereof shall belong to his banim; it shall be their achuzzah by nachalah."
Yechezkel,46,17,"But if he give a mattanah of his nachalah to one of his avadim, then it shall be his to the Shenat HaDeror (Jubilee Year) ; then it shall return to the Nasi; but his nachalah shall belong only to his banim."
Yechezkel,46,18,"Moreover the Nasi shall not take of the nachalah HaAm by oppression, to thrust them out of their achuzzah; but he shall give his banim nachalah out of his own achuzzah; that My people be not scattered each man from his achuzzah."
Yechezkel,46,19,"After he brought me through the entrance, which was at the side of the Sha'ar, into the lishkhot hakodesh of the Kohanim, which looked toward the tzafonah; and, hinei, there was a place at its western sides."
Yechezkel,46,20,"Then said he unto me, This is the place where the Kohanim shall cook the asham (trespass offering) and the chattat, where they shall bake the minchah; that they bear them not out into the Khatzer HaKhitzonah and so set apart as kodesh HaAm."
Yechezkel,46,21,"Then he brought me forth into the Khatzer HaKhitzonah, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the Khatzer; and, hinei, in the Khatzer I saw in every corner of the Khatzer there was a Khatzer."
Yechezkel,46,22,In the four corners of the Khatzer there were enclosed Khatzerot forty cubits long and thirty wide; these four corners were of one measure.
Yechezkel,46,23,"And there was a row of masonry saviv (around) inside them, round about these four, and it was made with hearths at the bottom of the rows round about."
Yechezkel,46,24,"Then said he unto me, These are the Bais HaMevashelim, where the Mesharetim of the Bais shall cook the zevach HaAm."
Yechezkel,47,1,"Afterward he brought me again unto the Petach HaBeis; and, hinei, mayim issued out from under the threshold of the Beis eastward; for the forefront of the Beis stood toward the east, and the mayim came down from under from the right side of the Beis, at the south side of the Mizbe'ach."
Yechezkel,47,2,"Then he brought me out of derech Sha'ar Tzafonah, and led me about the derech outside unto the outer Sha'ar by the derech that looketh eastward; and, hinei, there flowed out mayim on the right side."
Yechezkel,47,3,"And when the ish that had the measuring line in his yad went forth eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me through the mayim; the mayim were to the ankles."
Yechezkel,47,4,"Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through the mayim; the mayim were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through; the mayim were to the loins."
Yechezkel,47,5,"Afterward he measured a thousand; and it was a nachal (stream) that I could not cross over; for the mayim were risen, mayim to swim in, a nachal that could not be crossed over."
Yechezkel,47,6,"And he said unto me, Ben Adam, hast thou seen this? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the bank of the nachal."
Yechezkel,47,7,"Now when I had returned, hinei, at the bank of the nachal were etz rav me'od (very many trees) on the one side and on the other."
Yechezkel,47,8,"Then said he unto me, These mayim issue out toward the east country, and go down into the Aravah, and go into the Sea; which being brought forth into the Sea, the mayim shall be healed."
Yechezkel,47,9,"And it shall come to pass, that every nefesh chayyah, which moveth, whithersoever the nachalim shall come, shall live; and there shall be a very great multitude of dag (fish) , because these mayim shall come there; for they shall be healed; and every thing shall live whither the nachal cometh."
Yechezkel,47,10,"And it shall come to pass, that the fishermen shall stand upon it from Ein-Gedi even unto Ein Eglayim; they shall be a place to spread forth nets; their dag (fish) shall be according to their kinds, as the dag (fish) of the Yam HaGadol, exceeding many."
Yechezkel,47,11,But the miry places thereof and the marshes thereof shall not be healed; they shall be given to melach.
Yechezkel,47,12,"And by the nachal upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow kol etz ma'achal, whose aleh (leaf) shall not fade, neither shall the p'ri thereof fail; it shall yield fresh fruit every month, because the mayim for them flowed out of the Mikdash; and the p'ri thereof shall be for food, and the aleh (leaf) thereof for terufah (healing)."
Yechezkel,47,13,"Thus saith Adonoi Hashem : This shall be the boundary, whereby ye shall inherit HaAretz according to the Shnei Asar Shivtei Yisroel: Yosef shall have two portions."
Yechezkel,47,14,"And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another; concerning the which I lifted up Mine Yad to give it unto your Avot; and HaAretz HaZot shall fall unto you for nachalah."
Yechezkel,47,15,"And this shall be the boundary of HaAretz toward the north side, from the Yam HaGadol, the derech Chetlon, as men go to Tzedad;"
Yechezkel,47,16,"Chamat, Berotah, Sivrayim, which is between the boundary of Damascus and the boundary of Chamat; Chamat Chatzer Hattikhon, which is by the boundary of Chavran."
Yechezkel,47,17,"And the boundary from the Yam shall be Khatzar Einon, the boundary of Damascus, and the north northward, and the boundary of Chamat. And this is the north side."
Yechezkel,47,18,"And the east side ye shall measure from Chavran, and from Damascus, and from Gil'ad, and from Eretz Yisroel by Yarden, from the boundary unto the eastern sea. And this is the east side."
Yechezkel,47,19,"And the south side southward, from Tamar even to the waters of Merivot in Kadesh, the nachalah to the Yam HaGadol. And this is the south side southward."
Yechezkel,47,20,"The west side also shall be the Yam HaGadol from the boundary, until opposite the approach to Chamat. This is the west side."
Yechezkel,47,21,So shall ye divide HaAretz Hazot unto you according to the Shivtei Yisroel.
Yechezkel,47,22,"And it shall come to pass, that ye shall divide it by lot for a nachalah unto you, and to the gerim that sojourn among you, which shall father banim among you; and they shall be unto you as native-born among the Bnei Yisroel; they shall have nachalah with you among the Shivtei Yisroel."
Yechezkel,47,23,"And it shall come to pass, that in what shevet (tribe) the ger sojourneth, there shall ye give him his nachalah, saith Adonoi Hashem . Now these are the shmot of the Shevatim (Tribes)."
Yechezkel,48,1,"From the northern frontier near the derech Chetlon, as one goeth to Chamat, to Chatzar Einan, to the northward border of Damascus, near Chamat; for these are his, from the eastern side to the western side, Dan, one portion."
Yechezkel,48,2,"And by the border of Dan, from the east side unto the west side, Asher, one portion."
Yechezkel,48,3,"And by the border of Asher, from the east side even unto the west side, Naphtali, one portion."
Yechezkel,48,4,"And by the border of Naphtali, from the east side unto the west side, Menasheh, one portion."
Yechezkel,48,5,"And by the border of Menasheh, from the east side unto the west side, Ephrayim, one portion."
Yechezkel,48,6,"And by the border of Ephrayim, from the east side even unto the west side, Reuven, one portion."
Yechezkel,48,7,"And by the border of Reuven, from the east side unto the west side, Yehudah, one portion."
Yechezkel,48,8,"And by the border of Yehudah, from the east side unto the west side, shall be the terumah which ye shall offer of five and twenty elef [cubits] wide, and in length equal to one of the other portions, from the east side unto the west side; and the Bais shall be within it."
Yechezkel,48,9,"The terumah that ye shall offer unto Hashem shall be of five and twenty elef [cubits] in length, and of ten elef [cubits] in width."
Yechezkel,48,10,"And for them, even for the kohanim, shall be this terumat hakodesh; toward the north five and twenty elef, and toward the west ten elef in width, and toward the east ten elef in width, and toward the south five and twenty elef in length; and the Mikdash Hashem shall be within thereof."
Yechezkel,48,11,"It shall be for the kohanim hamekudash (set apart as kodesh) of the Bnei Tzadok; which have been shomer over My mishmeret, which went not astray when the Bnei Yisroel went astray, as the Levi'im went astray."
Yechezkel,48,12,"And this terumiyyah (separated portion) for the kohanim, out of the terumat ha'aretz, kodesh kodashim, next to the border of the Levi'im."
Yechezkel,48,13,"And over against the border of the kohanim, the Levi'im shall have five and twenty elef in length, and ten elef in width; all the length shall be five and twenty elef, and the width ten elef."
Yechezkel,48,14,"And they shall not sell of it, neither exchange, nor transfer the reshit ha'aretz (prime land) ; for it is kodesh unto Hashem."
Yechezkel,48,15,"And the five alafim, that are left in the width over against the five and twenty elef, shall be chol (secular, unconsecrated) for the Ir, for dwelling, and for migrash (open lands) ; and the Ir shall be within thereof."
Yechezkel,48,16,"And these shall be the measurement thereof; the north side four alafim and five hundred, and the south side four alafim and five hundred, and on the east side four alafim and five hundred, and the west side four alafim and five hundred."
Yechezkel,48,17,"And the migrash (open land) of the Ir shall extend toward the north two hundred and fifty [cubits], and toward the south two hundred and fifty, and toward the east two hundred and fifty, and toward the west two hundred and fifty."
Yechezkel,48,18,"And the remainder of that area running lengthwise along the terumat hakodesh shall measure ten alafim [cubits] eastward, and ten alafim westward; and the increase thereof shall be for lechem unto them that serve the Ir."
Yechezkel,48,19,And they that serve the Ir shall serve it out of all the Shivtei Yisroel.
Yechezkel,48,20,"All the terumah shall be foursquare, five and twenty elef by five and twenty elef; ye shall set apart as the terumat hakodesh and the property of the Ir."
Yechezkel,48,21,"And the remainder shall be for the Nasi, on the one side and on the other of the terumat hakodesh, and of the property of the Ir, along the five and twenty elef of the terumah toward the east border, and westward along the five and twenty elef toward the west border, along the chalakim (tribal portions) for the Nasi; and it shall be the terumat hakodesh; and the Mikdash HaBayit shall be within thereof."
Yechezkel,48,22,"Moreover from the property of the Levi'im, and from the property of the Ir, being in the midst of that which belongs to the Nasi, between the border of Yehudah and the border of Binyamin, shall be for the Nasi."
Yechezkel,48,23,"As for the rest of the Shevatim, from the east side unto the west side, Binyamin, one portion."
