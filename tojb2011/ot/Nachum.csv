Nachum,1,1,The burden concerning Nineveh. The sefer chazon (book of the vision) of Nachum of Elkosh.
Nachum,1,2,"A jealous G-d and taking vengeance is Hashem ; an avenger is Hashem , Ba'al Chemah (L-rd of Wrathful Fury); Hashem will take vengeance on His adversaries, and He reserveth wrath for His enemies."
Nachum,1,3," Hashem is slow to anger, and great in ko'ach, and will not at all leave the guilty unpunished; Hashem hath His way in the whirlwind and in the tempest, and the anan (clouds) are the dust of His feet."
Nachum,1,4," Hashem rebuketh the yam, and drieth it up, and maketh all the neharot (rivers) run dry; Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the flower of the Levanon fadeth."
Nachum,1,5,"The mountains quake before Hashem , and the hills melt away, and ha'aretz heaveth at His presence, yea, tevel (the world) , and all that dwell therein."
Nachum,1,6,Who can stand before Hashem Ê¼s fury? And who can endure His charon af (burning anger)? His chemah (wrath) is poured out like eish (fire) and the tzurim (rocks) are rent in pieces before Him.
Nachum,1,7," Hashem is tov, a maoz (stronghold) in the Yom Tzarah; and Hashem knoweth them that take refuge in Him."
Nachum,1,8,"But with an overwhelming flood He will make an utter end of her site, and Hashem shall pursue His enemies into choshech."
Nachum,1,9,"Whatever plot ye against Hashem, Hashem will make an utter end of anyone doing it; tzarah (affliction) will not arise a second time."
Nachum,1,10,"For while they be twisted together as sirim (thorns) , and while they are drunken as drunkards, they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry."
Nachum,1,11,"There is one come out of thee, that imagineth evil against Hashem , a yo'etz Beliya'al (a counselor of Beliya'al)."
Nachum,1,12,"Thus saith Hashem : Though they are strong, and likewise rabbim, yet shall they thus be cut down, and he shall pass away. Though I have afflicted thee [O Yehudah], I will afflict thee no more."
Nachum,1,13,"For now will I break his motah (yoke) from off thee, and will break thy fetters in pieces."
Nachum,1,14,"And Hashem hath given a command concerning thee, that no more of thy name be sown; out of the bais of thy g-ds will I cut off the pesel (graven image) and the molten image; I prepare thy kever (grave) ; for thou art vile."
Nachum,1,15,"Hinei, upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth Besorah (Good News) , that publisheth Shalom! O Yehudah, keep thy chagim, fulfill thy nedarim; for the Beliya'al shall no more pass through thee; he is utterly cut off."
Nachum,2,1,"A shatterer is come up before thy face [O Nineveh]; guard thy fortress, watch the derech, fortify thy loins, marshal all thy koach (power)."
Nachum,2,2,"For Hashem is about to restore the eminence of Ya'akov, like the eminence of Yisroel; for plunderers have plundered them, and made their vine branches as shachat."
Nachum,2,3,"The mogen (shield) of his gibborim is made red, the anshei chayil (valiant men) are in scarlet; the chariot shall flash like fire in the day of its array, and the spears shall be brandished."
Nachum,2,4,"The chariot shall rage in the streets, they shall jostle one against another in the rechovot, they shall seem like flaming torches, they shall dart about like the lightnings."
Nachum,2,5,"He shall remember his mighty ones; they stumble in their walk; they shall make haste to the chomah (wall) of it, and the defense shall be prepared."
Nachum,2,6,"The sha'arei haneharot (the gates of the rivers) shall be thrown open, and the heikhal (palace) reels."
Nachum,2,7,"Her golus (exile) is decreed, she shall be carried away, her slave girls moaning like the kol yonim (voice of doves) , beating their breasts."
Nachum,2,8,"But Nineveh is like a pool of mayim; and her mayim is draining away. Stop, stop, shall they cry; but no one turns back."
Nachum,2,9,"Take ye the plunder of kesef, take the plunder of zahav; for there is no end of the treasures, heaps of kol keli chemdah (every delightful vessel)."
Nachum,2,10,"She is empty, and void, and stripped; and the lev melteth, and the knees give way, bodies tremble, and the faces of them all grow pale."
Nachum,2,11,"Where is the ma'on arayot (den of lions) , and the feeding place of the young lions, where the aryeh, even the lioness, walked with their cubs, and none made them afraid?"
Nachum,2,12,"The aryeh did tear in pieces enough for his cubs, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his lairs with prey, and his dens with torn flesh."
Nachum,2,13,"Hineni, I am against thee [O Nineveh], saith Hashem Tzva'os, and I will burn your chariots in the smoke, and the cherev shall devour thy young lions; and I will cut off thy prey from ha'aretz, and the voice of thy malachim (messengers) shall no more be heard."
Nachum,3,1,Hoy (woe) to the ir damim (bloody city) ! It is all full of lies and booty; no end to the plunder;
Nachum,3,2,"The crack of the shot (whip) , and the noise of the rattling of the wheels, and of the prancing susim, and of the jolting merkavah (chariot);"
Nachum,3,3,"The parash (horsemen, cavalry) charging, the flash of the cherev and the glittering spear; and there is a multitude of slain, and a great number of dead bodies; and there is no end of their geviyot (corpses) ; they stumble over their geviyot;"
Nachum,3,4,"Because of the multitude of the harlotries of the alluring zonah, the ba'alat keshafim (the mistress of sorceries) , that enslaveth Goyim through her prostitutions, and mishpochot through her keshafim;"
Nachum,3,5,"Hineni, I am against thee, saith Hashem Tzva'os; and I will lift thy skirts over thy faces, and I will show the Goyim thy nakedness, and the mamlachot thy shame."
Nachum,3,6,"And I( Hashem) will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee contemptibly vile, and will make thee a spectacle."
Nachum,3,7,"And it shall come to pass, that all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is in ruins; who will bemoan her? From where shall I seek menachamim (comforters) for thee?"
Nachum,3,8,"Art thou better than No Amon (Thebes) , that was situated on the Nile, that had the mayim round about it, whose rampart was the yam, and her waters were her chomah?"
Nachum,3,9,"Ethiopia and Mitzrayim were her strength, and it was boundless; Put and Luvim (Libya) were her allies."
Nachum,3,10,"Yet she went into golus, she went into captivity; her olalim also were dashed in pieces at the head of all the streets; and they cast goral (lots) for her honorable men, and all her gedolim were bound in chains."
Nachum,3,11,"Thou also shalt be drunken, thou shalt be hid, thou also shalt seek maoz from the enemy."
Nachum,3,12,"All thy strongholds shall be like te'enim (fig trees) with the first ripe figs; if they be shaken, they shall even fall into the peh (mouth) of the ochel (eater)."
Nachum,3,13,"Hinei, thy troops in the midst of thee are nashim (women) ; the gates of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies; the eish shall devour thy (gate) bars."
Nachum,3,14,"Draw thee water for the matzor (siege) , fortify thy strongholds, go unto clay, and tread the mortar, repair the brickwork."
Nachum,3,15,"There shall the eish devour thee, the cherev shall consume thee, it shall eat thee up like the grasshopper. Make thyself many as the grasshopper, make thyself many as the arbeh (locust)."
Nachum,3,16,"Thou hast multiplied thy merchants more than the kokhavim of HaShomayim; but, like the locust, they strip the land, then fly away."
Nachum,3,17,"Thy commanders are as the swarming locusts, and thy officials as the great grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges on a cold day, but when the shemesh ariseth they flee away, and their place is whereabouts unknown."
Nachum,3,18,"Thy ro'im (shepherds) slumber, O melech of Ashur (Assyria) ; thy nobles shall dwell in the dust; thy people are scattered upon the mountains, and no man gathereth them."
Nachum,3,19,"There is no healing of thy shever (fracture, injury) ; thy wound is grievous; all that hear the news of thee shall clap their hands over thy fall; for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed tamid (continually)?"
