Amos,4,7,"And also I have withheld the geshem from you, when there were yet shloshah chodashim to the harvest; and I caused it to rain upon one town, and caused it not to rain upon another town; one chelek (part) was rained upon, and the chelek, whereupon it rained not, withered."

Amos,4,13,"For, hinei, He that formeth the harim, and createth the ruach, and declareth unto man what is his thought, that maketh the shachar darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth, Hashem Elohei Tzva'os Shmo."

Amos,5,3,"For thus saith Adonoi Hashem : The city that went out by a thousand will be left a hundred, and that which went forth by an hundred will be left ten, for Bais Yisroel."
Amos,5,4,"For thus saith Hashem unto Bais Yisroel: Seek ye Me, and live;"
Amos,5,5,"But seek not Beit-El, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Be'er-Sheva; for Gilgal shall surely go into golus, and Beit-El shall come to naught."

Amos,5,12,"For I have da'as of your manifold peysha'im and your mighty chattaim (sins) ; they afflict the tzaddik, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the sha'ar (gate, court) from their right."
Amos,5,13,Therefore the maskil (prudent) shall keep silence in such times; for it is an evil time.
Amos,5,14,"Seek tov, and not rah, that ye may live; and so Hashem Elohei Tzva'os shall be with you, just as ye say He is."

Amos,5,16,"Therefore Hashem Adonoi Elohei Tzva'os saith thus: Wailing shall be in all rechovot; and they shall cry in all the public squares, Alas! Alas! And they shall call the ikkar (farmer) to mourning, and such as are skillful of lamentation to wailing."
Amos,5,17,"And in all kramim (vineyards) shall be wailing; for I will pass through thee, saith Hashem."
Amos,5,18,"Hoy unto you that desire the Yom Hashem ! Why do ye seek it? The Yom Hashem is choshech, and not ohr."
Amos,5,19,"As if a man did flee from an ari, and a dov met him; or went into the bais, and leaned his hand on the kir (wall) , and a nachash bit him."
Amos,5,20,"Shall not the Yom Hashem be choshech, and not ohr? Even very dark, and no brightness in it?"
Amos,5,21,"I hate, I despise your chagim (religious festivals) , and I will not stand in your atzerot (solemn assemblies)."
Amos,5,22,"Though ye offer Me olot and your minchot, I will not accept them; neither will I regard your choice shelamim (peace offerings)."
Amos,5,23,Take thou away from Me the noise of thy shirim (songs) ; for I will not hear the melody of thy nevalim (harps).
Amos,5,24,"But let mishpat run down as mayim, and tzedakah as a never failing stream."
Amos,5,25,"Did ye offer unto Me zevakhim and minchah in the midbar arba'im shanah, O Bais Yisroel?"
Amos,5,26,"But ye have borne Sikkut your king and Kiyun your tzelamim, your star g-d, which ye made for yourselves."
Amos,5,27,"Therefore will I cause you to go into golus beyond Damascus, saith Hashem Elohei Tzva'os Shmo."

Amos,6,2,"Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to great Chamat; then go down to Gat of the Pelishtim (Philistines) ; be they better than these mamlachot? Or their territory more vast than your territory?"
Amos,6,3,"Ye that put far away the Yom Rah, and cause the shevet chamas to come near;"
Amos,6,4,"That lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat the lambs out of the tzon, and the calves from the stall;"
Amos,6,5,Who prattle to the tune of the nevel (harp) ; like Dovid they invent string instruments.
Amos,6,6,"That drink yayin in sacrificial bowls, and anoint themselves with the finest ointments; but they are not grieved for the shever Yosef (ruin of Yosef)."
Amos,6,7,"Therefore now shall they go into captivity at the head of the golus, and the merry shouting of the revellers will die."
Amos,6,8,"Adonoi Hashem hath sworn by Himself, saith Hashem Elohei Tzva'os: I abhor the ga'on Ya'akov, and hate his fortresses; therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein."

Amos,6,10,"And a manʼs relative shall take him up, and he that burieth him, to carry out the bones out of the bais, and shall say unto him still hiding inside, Is there yet any with thee? And he shall say, Not one. Then shall he say, Hold thy tongue; for the Shem Hashem is not to be invoked."
Amos,6,11,"For, hinei, Hashem commandeth, and He will strike the bais hagadol into ruins, and the bais hakaton into pieces."
Amos,6,12,"Do susim run upon the rock? Do men plow there with oxen? For ye have turned mishpat into poison, and the p'ri of tzedakah into wormwood;"
Amos,6,13,"Ye which rejoice over what is worthless, which say, Have we not taken to us horns by chazekeinu (our own strength)?"
Amos,6,14,"But, hineni, I will raise up against you a Goy (Nation) , O Bais Yisroel, saith Hashem Elohei Tzva'os; and they shall afflict you from the territory of Chamat unto the Wadi of the Aravah."
Amos,7,1,"Thus hath Adonoi Hashem showed unto me; and, hinei, He formed locusts in the beginning of the springing up of the second crop; and, hinei, it was the second crop after the mowing of the melech."
Amos,7,2,"And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating the vegetation of ha'aretz, then I said, O Adonoi Hashem , forgive, I beseech thee; how shall Ya'akov survive? For he is katon."
Amos,7,3," Hashem relented for this; It shall not be, saith Hashem."
Amos,7,4,"Thus hath Adonoi Hashem showed unto me; and, hinei, Adonoi Hashem called to punish with eish, and it devoured the tehom rabbah (great deep) , and did devour the chelek (portion)."

Amos,7,6," Hashem relented for this: This also shall not be, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Amos,7,7,"Thus He showed me; and, hinei, Hashem stood upon a chomah (wall) made with a plumb line, and a plumb line in His hand."
Amos,7,8,"And Hashem said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumb line. Then said Hashem , Hineni, I will set a plumb line in the midst of My people Yisroel; I will not again pass by them anymore;"
Amos,7,9,"And the high places of Yischak shall be desolate, and the mikdeshei Yisroel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the Bais Yarov'am with the cherev."
Amos,7,10,"Then Amatzyah the kohen of Beit-El sent to Yarov'am Melech Yisroel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of Bais Yisroel; the land is not able to bear all his words."
Amos,7,11,"For thus Amos saith, Yarov'am shall die by the cherev, and Yisroel shall surely be led away into the golus out of their own land."
Amos,7,12,"Also Amatzyah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into Eretz Yehudah, and there eat lechem, and prophesy there:"
Amos,7,13,"But prophesy not again any more at Beit-El; for it is the Mikdash Melech, and it is the Bais Mamlachah."
Amos,7,14,"Then answered Amos, and said to Amatzyah, I was no navi, neither was I a ben navi; but I was a herder, and a dresser of sycamore-fig trees;"
Amos,7,15,"And Hashem took me as I followed the tzon, and Hashem said unto me, Go, prophesy unto My people Yisroel."
Amos,7,16,"Now therefore hear thou the Devar Hashem : Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Yisroel, and drop not thy word against the Bais Yischak."
Amos,7,17,"Therefore thus saith Hashem : Thy isha shall be a zonah in the city, and thy banim and thy banot shall fall by the cherev, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in an adamah temei'ah (unclean land) ; and Yisroel shall surely go forth of his land into golus (exile)."
Amos,8,1,Thus hath Adonoi Hashem showed unto me: and hinei a basket of kayitz (summer fruit).
Amos,8,2,"And Hashem said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of kayitz (summer fruit) . Then said Hashem unto me, The ketz (end) is come upon My people Yisroel; I will not again pass by them [and spare them] anymore."

Amos,8,4,"Hear this, O ye that swallow up the needy, even to make the anivvei aretz (poor of the land) to fail,"
Amos,8,5,"Saying, When will the Rosh Chodesh be over, that we may sell grain? And Shabbos, that we may market wheat, making the eifah (bushel) small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by mirmah (deceit)?"
Amos,8,6,"That we may buy the poor for kesef, and the needy for a pair of sandals; yea, and sell the sweepings with the wheat?"
Amos,8,7," Hashem hath sworn by the ga'on Ya'akov, Surely I will never forget any of their ma'asim."
Amos,8,8,"Shall not ha'aretz (the land) tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwelleth therein? And the whole land shall rise like the Nile; and heave and sink, as by the Nile of Mitzrayim."

Amos,8,10,"And I will turn your chagim into mourning, and all your shirot into lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth upon all loins, and baldness upon every rosh; and I will make it as the mourning of a yachid (only son) , and the end thereof as a yom mar (bitter day)."
Amos,8,11,"Hinei, the yamim come, saith Adonoi Hashem , that I will send a ra'av (famine) in the land, not a ra'av (famine) of lechem, nor a thirst for mayim, but of hearing the Divrei Hashem;"
Amos,8,12,"And they shall wander from yam to yam, and from the tzafon (north) even to the mizrach (east) , they shall run to and fro to seek the Devar Hashem , and shall not find it."
Amos,8,13,In that Yom shall the betulot hayafot (fair virgins) and bochurim faint for thirst.
Amos,8,14,"They that swear by the sin of Shomron, and say, Chai Eloheicha, O Dan; and, The Derech Be'er-Sheva liveth; even they shall fall, and never rise up again."
Amos,9,1,"I saw Adonoi standing by the mizbe'ach; and He said, Strike the pillar capitals, that the thresholds may shake; and smash them upon the heads of all; and I will slay the last of them with the cherev; he that fleeth of them shall not get away, and he that escapeth of them shall not be delivered."
Amos,9,2,"Though they dig down to Sheol, thence shall Mine hand take them; though they climb up to Shomayim, thence will I bring them down;"
Amos,9,3,"And though they hide themselves in the summit of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from My sight in the bottom of the yam, thence will I command the nachash, and he shall bite them;"
Amos,9,4,"And though they go into golus (exile) before their enemies, thence will I command the cherev, and it shall slay them; and I will set Mine eyes upon them for rah, and not for tov."
Amos,9,5,"And Adonoi Hashem HaTzva'os is He that toucheth the land, and it shall melt, and all that dwell therein shall mourn; and it shall rise up wholly like the Nile; and sink like the Nile of Mitzrayim."
Amos,9,6,"It is He that buildeth his ma'alot (stairs) in Shomayim, and hath founded His aguddah (fitted together vault) over Eretz; He that calleth for the waters of the yam, and poureth them out upon the face of ha'aretz; Hashem Shmo."
Amos,9,7,"Are ye not as children of Ethiopia unto Me, O Bnai Yisroel? saith Hashem . Have not I brought up Yisroel out of Eretz Mitzrayim? And the Pelishtim (Philistines) from Caphtor, and Aram from Kir?"
Amos,9,8,"Hinei, the eyes of Adonoi Hashem are upon the mamlachah hachatta'ah, and I will destroy it from off the face of ha'aretz; nevertheless I will not utterly destroy Bais Ya'akov, saith Hashem."
Amos,9,9,"For, hinei, I will command, and I will sift Bais Yisroel among all Goyim, like as grain is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain fall upon ha'aretz."
Amos,9,10,"All the chatta'ei ami (sinners of My people) shall die by the cherev, which say, the ra'ah shall not overtake nor come to us."
Amos,9,11,"In that Yom will I raise up the Sukkat Dovid that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the yamei olam;"
Amos,9,12,"That they may possess the she'erit Edom and all the Goyim, which are called by Shmi, saith Hashem that doeth this."
Amos,9,13,"Hinei, the yamim are coming, saith Hashem , that the plowman shall overtake the kotzer (reaper) , and the treader of grapes him that soweth zera; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt."
Amos,9,14,"And I will bring again the captivity of My people Yisroel, and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they shall plant kramim (vineyards) , and drink the yayin thereof; they shall also make gannot, and eat the p'ri of them."
Amos,9,15,"And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be torn up out of their land which I have given them, saith Hashem Eloheicha."
