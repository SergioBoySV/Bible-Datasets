Tehillim,1,1,"Blessed is the ish that walketh not in the Etzah (counsel, scheme) of the Resha'im, nor standeth in the Derech Chatta'im, nor sitteth in the Moshav (seat) of the Leitzim (scornful, ones mocking and reviling)."
Tehillim,1,2,But his delight is in the Torat Hashem ; and in His torah doth he meditate yomam v'lailah.
Tehillim,1,3,"And he shall be like an etz planted by the streams of mayim, that bringeth forth its p'ri in its season; the leaf thereof also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper."
Tehillim,1,4,"The Resha'im are not so, but are like the chaff which the ruach driveth away."
Tehillim,1,5,"Therefore the Resha'im shall not stand in the Mishpat, nor Chatta'im (sinners) in the Adat Tzaddikim."
Tehillim,1,6,"For Hashem knoweth the Derech Tzaddikim, but the Derech Resha'im shall perish."
Tehillim,2,1,"Why do the Goyim rage, and the Amim (peoples) imagine a vain thing?"
Tehillim,2,2,"The Malchei Eretz rise up in rebellion, and the rulers take counsel together against Hashem and against His Moshiach, saying,"
Tehillim,2,3,"Let us break their chains asunder, and cast away their fetters from us."
Tehillim,2,4,He that sitteth enthroned in Shomayim laughs; Adonoi hath them in derision.
Tehillim,2,5,"Then shall He speak unto them in His wrath, and distress them in His hot displeasure."
Tehillim,2,6,"I have set Malki (My King) upon Tziyon, My Har Kodesh."
Tehillim,2,7,"I will declare the chok (decree): Hashem hath said unto me, Thou art Beni (My Son); HaYom (today) I have begotten thee."
Tehillim,2,8,"Ask of Me, and I shall give thee the Goyim for thine nachalah, and the uttermost parts of ha'aretz for thy possession."
Tehillim,2,9,Thou shalt rule them with a shevet barzel; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potterʼs vessel.
Tehillim,2,10,"Have seichel now therefore, O ye Melachim; be warned, ye Shoftei Aretz."
Tehillim,2,11,"Serve Hashem with fear, and rejoice with trembling."
Tehillim,2,12,"Kiss the Bar (Ben, Son), lest he be angry, and ye perish from the Derech, for his wrath can flare up in a moment. Ashrei are all they that take refuge in him."
Tehillim,3,1," Hashem , how are they increased that are my foes! Many are they that rise up against me."
Tehillim,3,2,"Many there be which say of my nefesh, There is no yeshu'ah for him in Elohim. Selah"
Tehillim,3,3,"But Thou, Hashem , art a mogen around me; my kavod, and the One who lifts up mine head."
Tehillim,3,4,"I cried unto Hashem with my voice, and He heard me out of His Har Kodesh. Selah"
Tehillim,3,5,"I laid me down and slept; I awaked, for Hashem sustains me."
Tehillim,3,6,"I will not be afraid of ten thousands of am (people) , that have set themselves against me round about."
Tehillim,3,7,"Arise, Hashem ; hoshieini (save me) , O Elohai; for Thou hast struck all mine enemies upon the cheekbone; Thou hast broken the teeth of the resha'im."
Tehillim,3,8,HaYeshuah (salvation) belongeth unto Hashem ; the Birkhat (blessing) of Thee is upon Thy people. Selah
Tehillim,4,1,"Hear me when I call, Elohei tzidki (O G-d of my righteousness) ; Thou hast relieved me when I was in distress; channeini, and hear my tefillah."
Tehillim,4,2,"O ye Bnei Ish, how long will ye turn my kavod into shame? How long will ye love delusion, and seek kazav (lie, falsehood) ? Selah"
Tehillim,4,3,But know that Hashem hath set apart the chasid for Himself; Hashem will hear when I call unto Him.
Tehillim,4,4,"Be angry, yet sin not; commune with your own levav upon your mishkav, and be still. Selah"
Tehillim,4,5,"Offer the zivkhei-tzedek, and put your trust in Hashem."
Tehillim,4,6,"There be many that say, Who will show us any tov? Hashem , lift Thou up the ohr of Thy countenance upon us."
Tehillim,4,7,"Thou hast put simcha in my lev, more than in the time that their dagan and their tirosh increased."
Tehillim,4,8,"In shalom I will both lay me down, and sleep, for Thou alone, Hashem , makest me dwell in safety."
Tehillim,5,1,"Give ear to my words, Hashem , consider my meditation."
Tehillim,5,2,"Pay heed unto the voice of my cry, Malki v'Elohai; for unto Thee will I daven."
Tehillim,5,3,"My voice shalt Thou hear in the boker, Hashem ; in the boker will I bring my prayer before Thee as a spiritual sacrifice and wait for an answer."
Tehillim,5,4,For Thou art not El that hath pleasure in resha; neither shall rah dwell with Thee.
Tehillim,5,5,The holelim (arrogant) shall not stand in Thy sight; Thou hatest all workers of iniquity.
Tehillim,5,6,Thou shalt destroy them that speak kazav (falsehood); Hashem will abhor the ish damim u'mirmah (bloody and deceitful man).
Tehillim,5,7,"But as for me, I will come into Thy Bais in the multitude of Thy chesed; and in Thy fear will I bow down toward Thy Heikhal Kodesh."
Tehillim,5,8,"Lead me, Hashem , in Thy tzedakah because of mine enemies; make Thy Derech straight before my face."
Tehillim,5,9,For there is nothing trustworthy in their mouth; their inwardness is a corruptible abyss; their throat is an open kever; they speak smooth deceit with their leshon.
Tehillim,5,10,"Punish them, Elohim; let them fall by their own intrigues; in the multitude of their peysha'im cast them out; for they have rebelled against Thee."
Tehillim,5,11,"But let all those that take refuge in Thee rejoice; let them shout for joy l'olam, and spread Thou protection over them that they be joyful in Thee, who love Shemecha (Thy Name)."
Tehillim,5,12,"For Thou, Hashem , wilt bless the Tzaddik; with ratzon (favor) wilt Thou encompass him as with a tzinnah (large rectangular shield)."
Tehillim,6,1," Hashem , rebuke me not in Thine anger, neither chasten me in Thy hot displeasure."
Tehillim,6,2,"Have mercy upon me, Hashem ; for I am weak: Hashem , heal me; for my atzmot are shaking."
Tehillim,6,3,"My nefesh is also much shaken; but Thou, Hashem , ad mosai (how much longer)?"
Tehillim,6,4,"Turn, Hashem , deliver my nefesh; hoshieini (save me) for the sake of Thy chesed."
Tehillim,6,5,For in mavet there is no remembrance of Thee; in Sheol who shall give Thee thanks?
Tehillim,6,6,I am weary with my groaning; all the lailah flood I my mittah with weeping; I water my couch with my tears.
Tehillim,6,7,Mine eye is consumed because of ka'as (grief) ; it groweth old because of all mine enemies.
Tehillim,6,8,"Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for Hashem hath heard the voice of my weeping."
Tehillim,6,9, Hashem hath heard my techinnah (supplication); Hashem will receive my tefillah (prayer).
Tehillim,6,10,Let all mine oyevim be ashamed and much troubled; let them turn back and suddenly be ashamed.
Tehillim,7,1," Hashem Elohai, in Thee do I seek refuge; hoshieini (save me) from all them that persecute me, and deliver me;"
Tehillim,7,2,"Lest he tear my nefesh like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to rescue."
Tehillim,7,3," Hashem Elohai, if I have done this; if there be guilt in my hands;"
Tehillim,7,4,"If I have recompensed with evil him that held out shalom unto me; or, without cause plundered my opposers,"
Tehillim,7,5,"Then let the enemy persecute my nefesh, and take it; yea, let him tread down my life to the earth, and lay mine kavod to sleep in the dust. Selah"
Tehillim,7,6,"Arise, Hashem , in Thine anger, lift up Thyself because of the rage of mine enemies; awake, o my El, to the mishpat Thou hast decreed."
Tehillim,7,7,So let the Adat l'Umim surround Thee; and over it return Thou on high.
Tehillim,7,8," Hashem shall judge the people; judge me, Hashem , according to my tzedek, and according to mine integrity that is in me."
Tehillim,7,9,Oh let the wickedness of the resha'im come to an end; but make the tzaddik secure; for the Elohim Tzaddik trieth the minds and hearts.
Tehillim,7,10,"My mogen (shield) is Elohim, Moshi'a of the upright in heart."
Tehillim,7,11,"Elohim is a Shofet Tzaddik, and El expresses wrath kol yom."
Tehillim,7,12,"If He relent not, He will sharpen His cherev; He hath bent His keshet (bow) and made it ready."
Tehillim,7,13,He hath also prepared for Him the instruments of mavet; He ordaineth His flaming khitzim (arrows).
Tehillim,7,14,"Hinei, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived trouble, and brought forth falsehood."
Tehillim,7,15,"He makes a pit, and digs it, and is fallen into the shachat (pit) which he made."
Tehillim,7,16,"His trouble shall return upon his own rosh, and his chamas shall come down upon his own kodkod (crown of the head)."
Tehillim,7,17,I will give thanks to Hashem according to His tzedek; and will sing praise to the Shem of Hashem Elyon.
Tehillim,8,1," Hashem Adoneinu, how excellent is Shimecha in kol ha'aretz, Who hast set Thy glory above HaShomayim."
Tehillim,8,2,"Out of the mouth of olelim and infants hast Thou established strength because of Thine enemies, that Thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger."
Tehillim,8,3,"When I consider Thy heavens, the ma'asim of Thy fingers, the yarei'ach and the kokhavim, which Thou hast ordained;"
Tehillim,8,4,"What is enosh (mankind) , that Thou art mindful of him? And the ben adam, that Thou visitest him?"
Tehillim,8,5,"For Thou hast made him a little lower than elohim, and hast crowned him with kavod and hadar."
Tehillim,8,6,Thou madest him to have dominion over the ma'asim of Thy hands; Thou hast put all things under his feet:
Tehillim,8,7,"All sheep and oxen, yea, and the behemot sadeh;"
Tehillim,8,8,"The fowl of the air, and the dag (fish) of the yam, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas."
Tehillim,8,9," Hashem Adoneinu, how excellent is Shimecha in kol ha'aretz!"
Tehillim,9,1,"I will give thanks to Thee, Hashem , with kol lev of me; I will show forth all Thy marvellous works."
Tehillim,9,2,"I will be glad and rejoice in Thee; I will sing praise to Thy Shem, O Thou Elyon."
Tehillim,9,3,"When mine oyevim are turned back, they shall fall and perish at Thy presence."
Tehillim,9,4,For Thou hast maintained my mishpat and my cause; Thou as Shofet Tzedek dost sit on the kisse.
Tehillim,9,5,"Thou hast rebuked the Goyim, Thou hast destroyed the wicked, Thou hast blotted out their shem l'olam va'ed."
Tehillim,9,6,Choravot lanetzach (endless ruins) have come to the enemy: and Thou hast rooted out cities; their memory is perished with them.
Tehillim,9,7,But Hashem shall reign l'olam; He hath established His kisse (throne) for mishpat.
Tehillim,9,8,"And He shall judge the tevel (world) in tzedek, He shall govern the nations with justice."
Tehillim,9,9," Hashem also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of tzoros."
Tehillim,9,10,"And they that know Shemecha will put their trust in Thee; for Thou, Hashem , hast not forsaken them that seek Thee."
Tehillim,9,11,"Sing praises to Hashem , enthroned in Tziyon; declare among the nations His deeds."
Tehillim,9,12,"When He avenges dahm, He remembereth them; He forgetteth not the cry of the aniyim (humble, afflicted, the helpless ones)."
Tehillim,9,13,"Have mercy upon me, Hashem ; consider my sufferings which I suffer of them that hate me, Thou that liftest me up from the sha'arei mavet (gates of death);"
Tehillim,9,14,That I may show forth all Thy praise in the Sha'arei Bat Tziyon. I will rejoice in Thy Yeshu'ah (salvation).
Tehillim,9,15,The Goyim are sunk down in the shachat (pit) that they dug; in the reshet (net) which they hid is their own foot caught.
Tehillim,9,16, Hashem is known by the mishpat which He executeth; the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgayon. Selah
Tehillim,9,17,"The resha'im shall be turned into Sheol, and all the Goyim that forget Elohim."
Tehillim,9,18,For the needy shall not always be forgotten; the tikveh of the poor shall not perish forever.
Tehillim,9,19,"Arise, Hashem ; let not enosh (mankind) prevail; let the Goyim be judged in Thy sight."
Tehillim,9,20,"Put them in terror, Hashem ; that the Goyim may know themselves to be but enosh. Selah"
Tehillim,10,1,"Why standest Thou afar off, Hashem ? Why hidest Thou Thyself in times of tzoros?"
Tehillim,10,2,The reshah in his ga'avah (haughtiness) doth persecute the ani (poor); let them be caught in the devices that they have schemed.
Tehillim,10,3,"For the reshah boasteth of his ta'avat nefesh (soulʼs lust) , and blesseth the covetous, whom Hashem abhorreth."
Tehillim,10,4,"The reshah, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after Him; Elohim is not in all his thoughts."
Tehillim,10,5,"His ways are always prosperous; Thy mishpatim are on high, out of his sight; as for all his enemies, he sneers at them."
Tehillim,10,6,"He hath said in his lev, I shall not be shaken; throughout all generations I shall never be in trouble."
Tehillim,10,7,His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud; under his leshon (tongue) is trouble and iniquity.
Tehillim,10,8,He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages; in the places for ambush doth he murder the naki (innocent) ; his eyes are secretly set against the poor.
Tehillim,10,9,He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den; he lieth in wait to catch the poor; he doth catch the poor when he draweth him into his reshet.
Tehillim,10,10,"He crouches, and stoops, that the poor may fall by his atzum (might)."
Tehillim,10,11,"He hath said in his lev, El hath forgotten; He hideth his face; He will never see it."
Tehillim,10,12,"Arise, Hashem ; O El, lift up Thine yad; forget not the aniyim."
Tehillim,10,13,"For why doth the reshah renounce Elohim? He hath said in his lev, Thou wilt not call me to account."
Tehillim,10,14,"Thou hast seen it; for Thou beholdest trouble and ka'as (grief) , to requite it with Thy yad; the helpless committeth himself unto Thee; Thou art the Ozer (helper) of the yatom (orphan)."
Tehillim,10,15,Break Thou the zero'a of the reshah and the evil man; call to account his wickedness that would not be found out.
Tehillim,10,16, Hashem is Melech olam va'ed; the Goyim are perished out of His land.
Tehillim,10,17," Hashem , Thou hast heard the desire of the aniyim; Thou wilt strengthen their lev, Thou wilt cause Thine ear to hear;"
Tehillim,10,18,"To judge the yatom (orphan) and the oppressed, that enosh of the earth may no more strike terror."
Tehillim,11,1,"In Hashem do I take refuge; how say ye to my nefesh, Flee as a bird to your mountain?"
Tehillim,11,2,"For, hinei, the resha'im bend their bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may secretly shoot at the yishrei lev (upright in heart)."
Tehillim,11,3,"If the foundations be destroyed, what can the tzaddik do?"
Tehillim,11,4," Hashem is in His Heikhal Kodesh, Hashem ʼs kisse is in Shomayim; His eyes examine, His eyelids try, Bnei Adam."
Tehillim,11,5," Hashem trieth the tzaddik, but the resha'im and him that loveth chamas (violence) His Nefesh hateth."
Tehillim,11,6,"Upon the resha'im He shall rain snares, eish and gofrit, and a burning wind; this shall be the portion of their kos (cup)."
Tehillim,11,7,"For Hashem is tzaddik (righteous), Hashem loveth tzedakot; His countenance doth behold the yashar (upright)."
Tehillim,12,1,"Help, Hashem ; for the chasid is no more; for the emunim (faithful ones) vanish from among Bnei Adam."
Tehillim,12,2,They speak vanity every one with his re'a (neighbor) ; with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak.
Tehillim,12,3," Hashem shall cut off all flattering lips, and the leshon that speaketh gedolot;"
Tehillim,12,4,"Who have said, With leshoneinu (our tongue) will we prevail; our lips are our own: who is Adon over us?"
Tehillim,12,5,"For the oppression of the aniyim, for the groaning of the needy, now will I arise, saith Hashem ; I will set him in safety from him that sneers at him."
Tehillim,12,6,"The words of Hashem are amarot tehorot (pure words) ; as kesef refined in the furnace on the earth, purified seven times."
Tehillim,12,7,"Thou shalt be shomer over them, Hashem , Thou shalt preserve him from this generation forever."
Tehillim,12,8,"The resha'im strut on every side, when the vilest among the Bnei Adam are exalted."
Tehillim,13,1,"How long wilt Thou forget me, Hashem ? Netzach (forever) ? How long wilt Thou hide Thy face from me?"
Tehillim,13,2,"How long shall I take counsel in my nefesh, having sorrow in my lev daily? How long shall mine oyev be exalted over me?"
Tehillim,13,3,"Consider and hear me, Hashem Elohai; enlighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of mavet;"
Tehillim,13,4,"Lest mine oyev say, I have prevailed against him; and those that trouble me rejoice when I am defeated."
Tehillim,13,5,But I have trusted in Thy chesed; my lev shall rejoice in Thy Yeshu'ah (salvation).
Tehillim,13,6,"I will sing unto Hashem , because He hath dealt bountifully with me."
Tehillim,14,1,"The naval (fool) hath said in his lev, There is no Elohim. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, ein oseh tov (there is none that doeth good)."
Tehillim,14,2," Hashem looked down from Shomayim upon Bnei Adam, to see if there is any with seichel, that seeketh Elohim."
Tehillim,14,3,"They are all turned aside, they are all together become corrupt; there is none that doeth tov, no, not one."
Tehillim,14,4,"Have all the workers of iniquity no da'as? Who eat up my people as they eat lechem, and call not upon Hashem."
Tehillim,14,5,"There they shall be in great dread, for Elohim is with the dor tzaddik."
Tehillim,14,6,"Would ye confound the etzah (counsel, plan) of the oni (poor) , for Hashem is indeed his refuge!"
Tehillim,14,7,"Oh that the Yeshu'ah (salvation) of Yisroel were come out of Tziyon! When Hashem turns misfortune and brings back the captives of His people, Ya'akov shall rejoice, and Yisroel shall be glad."
Tehillim,15,1," Hashem , who shall abide in Thy Ohel? Who shall dwell in Thy Har Kodesh?"
Tehillim,15,2,"He that walketh blamelessly, and worketh tzedek, and speaketh emes from his lev."
Tehillim,15,3,"He that backbiteth not with his leshon, nor doeth ra'ah to his re'a, nor taketh up a slur to discredit his neighbor."
Tehillim,15,4,"In whose eyes a vile person is despicable; but he honoreth them that fear Hashem . He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not."
Tehillim,15,5,"He that putteth not out his kesef to neshekh (usury) , nor taketh bribes against the naki (innocent) . He that doeth these things shall never be shaken."
Tehillim,16,1,"Be shomer over me, O El: for in Thee do I hide myself."
Tehillim,16,2,"I said unto Hashem , Thou art Adonoi of me; besides Thee I have no good;"
Tehillim,16,3,"But to the Kedoshim that are in ha'aretz, they are the glorious ones, in whom is all my delight."
Tehillim,16,4,"Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after other g-ds; their nesakhim (drink offerings) of dahm will I not offer, nor take up their shmot (names) on my lips."
Tehillim,16,5," Hashem is the chelek (allotted share) of mine inheritance and of my kos (cup); Thou maintainest my goral (lot, allotment by the divine will)."
Tehillim,16,6,"The boundary lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly nachalah (inheritance)."
Tehillim,16,7,"I will bless Hashem , Who hath given me counsel; my mind also instructs me in the night seasons."
Tehillim,16,8,"I have set Hashem always before me; because He is at my right hand, I shall not be shaken."
Tehillim,16,9,"Therefore my lev is glad, and my kavod rejoiceth; my basar also shall dwell securely."
Tehillim,16,10,"For Thou wilt not abandon my nefesh in Sheol; neither wilt Thou allow Thine Chasid to see shachat (corruption, the pit, the grave, the abyss of corruption)."
Tehillim,16,11,"Thou wilt show me the Orach Chayyim (the path of life) ; in Thy presence is fulness of joy, at Thy right hand there are pleasures netzach (for evermore)."
Tehillim,17,1,"Hear the tzedek (righteous plea of a just cause), Hashem , attend unto my cry, give ear unto my tefillah, that goeth not out of lips of mirmah (deceit)."
Tehillim,17,2,Let my mishpat (right) come forth from Thy presence; let Thine eyes behold the things that are right.
Tehillim,17,3,Thou hast probed mine lev; Thou hast visited me in the lailah; Thou hast tested me and shalt find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.
Tehillim,17,4,"Concerning the works of men, by the Devar of Thy lips I have kept myself from the paths of the cruel."
Tehillim,17,5,"Uphold my goings in Thy paths, that my footsteps stumble not."
Tehillim,17,6,"I have called upon Thee, for Thou wilt hear me, O El; incline Thine ear unto me, and hear my prayer."
Tehillim,17,7,"Show Thy marvellous chesed, O Thou Moshi'a Who saves by Thy right hand them which put their trust in Thee from those that rise up against them."
Tehillim,17,8,"Be shomer over me as the apple of Thy eye; hide me in the shadow of Thy wings,"
Tehillim,17,9,"From the resha'im that oppress me, from my deadly enemies threatening my nefesh, who surround me."
Tehillim,17,10,They have closed up callously and mercilessly against me; with their mouth they speak with ge'ut (pride).
Tehillim,17,11,At every step they have surrounded me; their purpose is to strike down to ha'aretz;
Tehillim,17,12,"Like aryeh eager to tear his prey, and like a young lion lurking in ambush."
Tehillim,17,13,"Arise, Hashem , confront him, cast him down; deliver my nefesh from the resha with Thy cherev;"
Tehillim,17,14,"From men with Thy yad, Hashem , from men of the world, whose portion is in this life, and with Thy treasures Thou fillest their belly; they are satisfied with children, and leave their abundance to their babes."
Tehillim,17,15,"As for me, in tzedek I will behold Thy face; I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with Thy temunah (form)."
Tehillim,18,1,"I will love Thee, Hashem , my strength."
Tehillim,18,2," Hashem is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; Eli my Tzur (rock) , in whom I take refuge; my mogen, and the keren of my salvation, and my misgav (high place as a refuge)."
Tehillim,18,3,"I will call upon Hashem , Who is worthy to be praised; so shall I be saved from mine oyevim."
Tehillim,18,4,"The chevlei mavet entangled me, and the floods of Beliya'al terrorized me."
Tehillim,18,5,The chevlei Sheol snaked around me; the snares of mavet confronted me.
Tehillim,18,6,"In my distress I called upon Hashem , and cried unto Elohai; He heard my voice out of His Heikhal, and my cry came before Him, even into His ears."
Tehillim,18,7,"Ha'aretz shook and trembled; the foundations also of the mountains quaked and were shaken, because He was angry."
Tehillim,18,8,"Smoke went up from His nostrils, and eish out of His mouth devoured; coals were kindled by it."
Tehillim,18,9,"He parted Shomayim, and descended, and dark clouds were under His feet."
Tehillim,18,10,"And He rode upon a keruv (cherub) , and did fly; yea, He soared upon the wings of the ruach."
Tehillim,18,11,He made choshech His secret place; His sukkah round about Him was dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.
Tehillim,18,12,Out of the brightness that was before Him there broke through barad (hailstones) and coals of eish out of His clouds.
Tehillim,18,13," Hashem also thundered in Shomayim, and Elyon gave His voice amid barad and coals of eish."
Tehillim,18,14,"Yea, He sent out His khitzim (arrows) , and scattered them; and He shot out great lightning bolts, and did put them to rout."
Tehillim,18,15,"Then the channels of waters were exposed, and the foundations of the tevel (world) were laid bare at Thy rebuke, Hashem , at the blast of the ruach of Thy nostrils."
Tehillim,18,16,"He sent from on high, He took hold of me, He drew me out of mayim rabbim (many waters)."
Tehillim,18,17,"He delivered me from my strong oyev, and from them which hated me; for they were too strong for me."
Tehillim,18,18,They confronted me in the day of my calamity; but Hashem was my stay.
Tehillim,18,19,"He brought me forth also into a place merkhav (spacious) ; He delivered me, because He delighted in me."
Tehillim,18,20, Hashem dealt with me according to my tzedek; according to the cleanness of my hands hath He recompensed me.
Tehillim,18,21,"For I have been shomer regarding the Darkhei Hashem , and have not wickedly departed from Elohai."
Tehillim,18,22,"For all His mishpatim were before me, and I did not put away His chukkot from me."
Tehillim,18,23,"I was also tamim (blameless) before Him, and I kept myself from mine avon."
Tehillim,18,24,"Therefore hath Hashem recompensed me according to my tzedek, according to the cleanness of my hands before His eyes."
Tehillim,18,25,With the chasid Thou wilt show Thyself chesed; with a perfect man Thou wilt show Thyself perfect;
Tehillim,18,26,"With the pure Thou wilt show Thyself pure; and with the ikesh (crooked, perverted, false) Thou wilt show Thyself shrewd."
Tehillim,18,27,For Thou wilt save the ani (poor) ; but wilt bring down low haughty looks.
Tehillim,18,28,For Thou wilt light my ner; Hashem Elohai will enlighten my choshech.
Tehillim,18,29,For by Thee have I scattered a troop; and by Elohai have I leaped over a wall.
Tehillim,18,30,"As for El, His derech is tamim (perfect) ; the word of Hashem is tzerufah (tested and proved flawless, inerrant) ; He is a mogen to all those that take refuge in Him."
Tehillim,18,31,For who is Elohim besides Hashem ? Or who is Tzur but Eloheinu?
Tehillim,18,32,"It is El that armeth me with chayil, and maketh my derech tamim (perfect)."
Tehillim,18,33,"He maketh my raglayim like deer feet, and setteth me upon my high places."
Tehillim,18,34,"He traineth my hands for milchamah, so that a keshet-nechushah mine arms can bend."
Tehillim,18,35,"Thou hast also given me the mogen of Thy salvation; and Thy right hand hath held me up, and Thy lowliness hath made me great."
Tehillim,18,36,"Thou hast made rakhav (broad) the place for my footsteps under me, that my ankles did not turn."
Tehillim,18,37,"I have pursued mine oyevim, and overtaken them; neither did I turn back till they were consumed."
Tehillim,18,38,I have crushed them that they were not able to rise; they are fallen under my raglayim.
Tehillim,18,39,For Thou hast armed me with chayil unto the milchamah; Thou hast made bow down under me those that rose up against me.
Tehillim,18,40,Thou hast also given me the necks of mine oyevim; that I might destroy them that hate me.
Tehillim,18,41,"They cried for help, but there was no Moshi'a to save them, even unto Hashem , but He answered them not."
Tehillim,18,42,Then did I beat them small as the dust before the ruach; I did empty them out as the dirt in the chutzot (streets).
Tehillim,18,43,Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and Thou hast made me the Rosh (head) of the Goyim (nations) ; an Am (people) whom I have not known shall serve me.
Tehillim,18,44,"As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me; the Bnei Nekhar (foreigners) shall submit themselves unto me."
Tehillim,18,45,"The Bnei Nekhar shall fade away, and come forth trembling out of their misgerot (stongholds, fastnesses, secure places)."
Tehillim,18,46, Hashem chai; and baruch be my Tzur; and let the Elohei of my salvation be exalted.
Tehillim,18,47,"It is El that avengeth me, and subdueth the nations under me."
Tehillim,18,48,"He saveth me from mine oyevim; yea, Thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me; Thou hast delivered me from the ish chamas."
Tehillim,18,49,"Therefore will I give thanks unto Thee, Hashem , among the Goyim, and sing praises unto Shimecha."
Tehillim,18,50,"Great deliverance giveth He to His Melech; and showeth chesed to His Moshiach, to Dovid, and to his Zera ad olam."
Tehillim,19,1,HaShomayim declare the kavod of G-d; and the raki'a (firmament) showeth His handiwork.
Tehillim,19,2,"Yom unto yom uttereth speech, and lailah unto lailah showeth da'as."
Tehillim,19,3,"There is no speech nor devarim (language) , where their voice is not heard."
Tehillim,19,4,"Their measuring line is gone out through kol ha'aretz, and their words to the end of the tevel (world) . In them hath He set an ohel for the shemesh,"
Tehillim,19,5,"Which is like a choson coming out of his chuppah, and rejoiceth as a gibbor to run a race."
Tehillim,19,6,"Its going forth is from the end of HaShomayim, and its circuit unto the ends of it; and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof."
Tehillim,19,7,"The torah of Hashem is temimah, converting the nefesh, the edut of Hashem is ne'emanah, making wise the simple."
Tehillim,19,8,"The precepts of Hashem are yasharim (right) , rejoicing the lev; the mitzvat Hashem is bara (clear, pure) , enlightening the eyes."
Tehillim,19,9,"The yirat Hashem (fear of the L-rd) is tehorah (clean) , enduring forever; the mishpatim of Hashem are emes and righteous altogether."
Tehillim,19,10,"More to be desired are they than zahav, yea, than much fine gold; sweeter also than devash and the honeycomb."
Tehillim,19,11,Moreover by them is Thy eved warned; and in being shomer over them there is great reward.
Tehillim,19,12,Who can discern his errors? Cleanse Thou me from nistarot (secret ones).
Tehillim,19,13,"Keep back Thy eved also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me; then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the peysha rav (great transgression)."
Tehillim,19,14,"Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my lev, be acceptable in Thy sight, O Hashem , my Tzur (rock) , and Go'ali (my Redeemer)."
Tehillim,20,1, Hashem hear thee in the Yom Tzarah (day of trouble) ; the Shem Elohei Ya'akov set thee up on high;
Tehillim,20,2,"Send thee help from the Kodesh (Holy Sanctuary) , and strengthen thee out of Tziyon;"
Tehillim,20,3,"Remember all thy minchot, and accept thy olat; Selah"
Tehillim,20,4,"Grant thee according to thine own levav, and fulfil kol etzah (plan, counsel) of thine."
Tehillim,20,5,"We will shout for joy at thy Yeshu'ah (salvation) , and in the Shem of Eloheinu we will lift up our banners; Hashem grant all thy requests."
Tehillim,20,6,Now I have da'as that Hashem hoshi'a (He saves) His Moshiach; He will answer him from His Sh'mei Kodesh (Holy Heaven) with the saving strength of His right hand.
Tehillim,20,7,"Some trust in chariots, and some susim: but we will trust in the Shem Hashem Eloheinu."
Tehillim,20,8,"They are brought down and fallen, but we are risen up, and stand firm."
Tehillim,20,9,"Hoshi'ah, Hashem , HaMelech! May He hear us on the day when we call."
Tehillim,21,1,"Melech shall have simcha in Thy strength, Hashem ; and in Thy Yeshu'ah (salvation) how greatly shall he rejoice!"
Tehillim,21,2,"Thou hast given him the desire of his lev, and hast not withheld the request of his lips. Selah"
Tehillim,21,3,For Thou meeteth him with the birkhot tov; Thou settest an ateret of pure gold on his head.
Tehillim,21,4,"He asked Chayyim of Thee, and Thou gavest it him, even length of yamim olam va'ed;"
Tehillim,21,5,Gadol is his kavod in Thy Yeshu'ah (salvation) ; hod v'hadar hast Thou bestowed upon him.
Tehillim,21,6,For Thou hast made him birkhot forever; Thou hast made him exceeding glad with simcha in Thy presence.
Tehillim,21,7,"For HaMelech trusteth in Hashem , and through the chesed of Elyon he shall not be moved."
Tehillim,21,8,Thine yad shall find out all thine enemies; thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.
Tehillim,21,9,"Thou shalt make them like an oven of eish in the time of thine presence; Hashem shall swallow them up in His wrath, and the eish shall devour them."
Tehillim,21,10,"Their fruit shalt Thou destroy from ha'aretz, and their zera from among Bnei Adam."
Tehillim,21,11,"For they intended ra'ah against Thee; they devised a plot, which they are not able to perform."
Tehillim,21,12,"Ki (therefore) shalt Thou make them turn their backs, when Thou shalt aim Thine bowstrings at their faces."
Tehillim,21,13,"Be Thou exalted, Hashem , in Thine Own Strength; so will we sing and praise Thy gevurah (power)."
Tehillim,22,1,"Eli, Eli, lamah azavtani? Why art Thou so far from my yeshu'ah, and from the words of my groaning?"
Tehillim,22,2,"Elohai, I cry yomam, but Thou hearest not; and v'lailah, and am not silent."
Tehillim,22,3,"But Atah Kadosh, O Thou enthroned on the tehillot Yisroel."
Tehillim,22,4,"Avoteinu trusted in Thee; they had bitachon, and Thou didst deliver them."
Tehillim,22,5,"They cried unto Thee, and were delivered; they had bitachon in Thee, and were not disappointed."
Tehillim,22,6,"But I am a tola'at, and no ish; a reproach of men, and despised of the people."
Tehillim,22,7,"All they that see me mock me; they shoot out the lip, they shake the rosh, saying,"
Tehillim,22,8,"He trusted in Hashem ; let Hashem rescue him; let Him deliver him, since He delights in him."
Tehillim,22,9,But Thou art He that took me out of the womb; Thou didst make me trust when I was upon the breasts of immi.
Tehillim,22,10,I was cast upon Thee from the womb; Thou art Eli from the womb of immi.
Tehillim,22,11,Be not far from me; for tzoros is near; and there is none to help.
Tehillim,22,12,Parim rabbim (many bulls) have encompassed me; strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round about.
Tehillim,22,13,"They opened wide their mouths upon me, like an aryeh roaring and tearing prey."
Tehillim,22,14,"I am poured out like mayim, and all my atzmot are out of joint; my lev is like wax; it is melted away within me."
Tehillim,22,15,My ko'ach is dried up like baked clay; and my leshon cleaveth to my jaws; and Thou layest me in the aphar mavet (dust of death).
Tehillim,22,16,For kelavim have surrounded me; the Adat Mere'im (congregation of evil men) have enclosed me; KA'ARU YADAI V'RAGELAI (they pierced my hands and my feet).
Tehillim,22,17,I can count all my atzmot; the people stare and gloat at me.
Tehillim,22,18,"They divide up my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast goral (lots)."
Tehillim,22,19,"But be not Thou far from me, Hashem ; O my strength, hasten Thee to help me."
Tehillim,22,20,"Deliver my nefesh from the cherev, my yechid (only one, only) [nefesh] from the power of the kelev (dog)."
Tehillim,22,21,Hoshieini from the mouth of the aryeh; for Thou hast heard me from the karnayim of the wild bulls.
Tehillim,22,22,I will declare Thy Shem unto my Achim; in the midst of the Kahal will I praise Thee.
Tehillim,22,23,"Ye that fear Hashem , praise Him; all ye Zera Ya'akov, give Him kavod; and fear Him, all ye Zera Yisroel."
Tehillim,22,24,"For He hath not despised nor disdained the enut ani (affliction of the afflicted) ; neither hath He hid His face from him; but when he cried unto Him, He heard."
Tehillim,22,25,My tehillah shall be from Thee in the Kahal Rav; I will fulfill my nedar before them that fear Him.
Tehillim,22,26,The anavim (meek) shall eat and be satisfied; they that seek Him shall praise Hashem . Let your levav live forever!
Tehillim,22,27,All the ends of HaAretz shall remember and turn unto Hashem ; and all the mishpechot of the Goyim shall bow down in worship before Thee.
Tehillim,22,28,For the Meluchah is Hashem ʼs: and He is the Moshel over the Goyim.
Tehillim,22,29,All they that thrive upon HaAretz shall eat and worship; all they that go down to the aphar (dust) shall bow before Him; even he who cannot keep alive his own nefesh.
Tehillim,22,30,Zera shall serve Him; it shall be told to the generation [to come] concerning Adonoi.
Tehillim,22,31,"They shall come, and shall declare His tzedek unto an Am Nolad (a [future] people that shall be born) , that He hath done this."
Tehillim,23,1, Hashem is my Ro'eh (Shepherd) ; I shall not lack.
Tehillim,23,2,He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside the mei menuchot (tranquil waters).
Tehillim,23,3,He restoreth my nefesh; He guideth me in the paths of tzedek l'ma'an Shmo (righteousness for the sake of His Name).
Tehillim,23,4,"Yea, though I walk through the Gey Tzalmavet (Valley of the Shadow of Death) , I will fear no rah (evil) ; for Thou art with me; Thy shevet (rod) and Thy staff they comfort me."
Tehillim,23,5,Thou preparest a shulchan before me in the presence of mine enemies: Thou anointest my head with shemen (olive oil) ; my kos runneth over.
Tehillim,23,6,"Surely tov and chesed shall follow me kol y'mei chaiyyai (all the days of my life) : and I will dwell in the Bais Hashem l'orech yamim (for length of days, whole life long, forever)."
Tehillim,24,1,"Ha'aretz is Hashem ʼs, and the fullness thereof; the tevel (world) , and they that dwell therein."
Tehillim,24,2,"For He hath founded it upon the yamim (seas) , and established it upon the waters."
Tehillim,24,3,Who shall ascend the Har Hashem ? Or who shall stand in His Makom Kodesh?
Tehillim,24,4,"He that hath clean hands, and a bar levav (pure heart) ; who hath not lifted up his nefesh unto shahv (vanity) , nor sworn l'mirmah (deceitfully)."
Tehillim,24,5,"He shall receive the brocha (blessing) from Hashem , and tzedakah from Elohei Yisho (the G-d of his Salvation)."
Tehillim,24,6,"This is the generation of them that seek Him, that seek Thy face, O Ya'akov. Selah"
Tehillim,24,7,"Lift up your heads, O ye she'arim; and be ye lifted up, ye Pitchei Olam (everlasting doorways) ; and Melech HaKavod shall come in."
Tehillim,24,8,"Who is this Melech HaKavod? Hashem strong and mighty, Hashem Gibbor Milchamah."
Tehillim,24,9,"Lift up your heads, O ye she'arim; even lift them up, ye Pitchei Olam; and Melech HaKavod shall come in."
Tehillim,24,10,"Who is this Melech HaKavod? Hashem Tzva'os, He is Melech HaKavod. Selah"
Tehillim,25,1," [Aleph] Unto Thee, Hashem , do I lift up my nefesh."
Tehillim,25,2," [Bais] O Elohai, I trust in Thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine oyevim triumph over me."
Tehillim,25,3," [Gimel] Yea, let none that wait [hoping in] Thee be ashamed; let them be ashamed which transgress without cause."
Tehillim,25,4," [Dalet] Show me Thy ways, Hashem ; teach me Thy paths."
Tehillim,25,5," [Heh Vav] Lead me in Thy emes, and teach me; for Thou art the Elohei of my Salvation; on Thee do I wait kol hayom."
Tehillim,25,6," [Zayin] Remember, Hashem , Thy rachamim and Thy lovingkindnesses; for they have ever been of old."
Tehillim,25,7," [Chet] Remember not the chattot of my youth, nor my peysha'im; according to Thy chesed remember Thou me for the sake of Thy goodness, Hashem."
Tehillim,25,8, [Tet] Tov and yashar is Hashem ; therefore will He teach chatta'im in the Derech.
Tehillim,25,9, [Yod] The meek will He guide in mishpat; and the aniyim will He teach His way.
Tehillim,25,10," [Kaph] All the paths of Hashem are chesed and emes unto such as keep His Brit (covenant) and His Edot (covenant demands, urgings, reminders, testimonies)."
Tehillim,25,11," [Lamed] For the sake of Thy Shem, Hashem , pardon mine iniquity; for it is great."
Tehillim,25,12, [Mem] What man is he that feareth Hashem ? Him shall He teach in the Derech that he shall choose.
Tehillim,25,13, [Nun] His nefesh (soul) shall dwell in prosperity; and his zera shall inherit the earth.
Tehillim,25,14, [Samech] The secret of Hashem is with them that fear Him; and He will show them His Brit (covenant).
Tehillim,25,15, [Ayin] Mine eyes are ever toward Hashem ; for He shall pluck my feet out of the reshet (net).
Tehillim,25,16," [Peh] Turn Thee unto me, and be gracious unto me; for I am yachid (alone, lonely) and afflicted."
Tehillim,25,17, [Tzade] The tzoros of my lev are multiplied; O bring Thou me forth out of my distresses.
Tehillim,25,18, [Resh] Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and take away all my chattot.
Tehillim,25,19, [Resh] Look upon mine enemies; for they are increased; and they hate me with sinas chamas.
Tehillim,25,20," [Shin] Be shomer over my nefesh, and deliver me; let me not be ashamed; for I take refuge in Thee."
Tehillim,25,21," [Tav] Let tohm (integrity, guilelessness) and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on Thee."
Tehillim,25,22,"Redeem Yisroel, O Elohim, out of all his tzoros."
Tehillim,26,1,"Vindicate me, Hashem ; for I have walked in mine tohm (guilelessness) ; I have trusted also in Hashem without wavering."
Tehillim,26,2,"Examine me, Hashem , and prove me; try my heart and my mind."
Tehillim,26,3,For Thy chesed is before mine eyes; and I have walked in Thy emes.
Tehillim,26,4,"I do not sit with metei-shav (men of vanity) , neither will I go in with dissemblers."
Tehillim,26,5,I have hated the kehal mere'im (congregation of evil doers) ; and will not sit with the resha'im.
Tehillim,26,6,"I will wash mine hands in nikkayon (innocency, cleanness, freedom from punishment) ; so will I encompass Thine Mizbe'ach, Hashem;"
Tehillim,26,7,"That I may publish with the voice of todah, and tell of all Thy wondrous works."
Tehillim,26,8," Hashem , I have loved the ma'on of Thy Bais, and the Mishkan where Thine kavod dwelleth."
Tehillim,26,9,"Take not away my nefesh with chatta'im (sinners) , nor my Chai (life) with anshei damim;"
Tehillim,26,10,"In whose hands is zimmah (wicked plans) , and their right hand is full of shochad (bribery)."
Tehillim,26,11,"But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity; redeem me, v'chaneini (and be merciful and gracious unto me)."
Tehillim,26,12,My regel standeth on level ground; in the great assemblies unto Hashem will I render brocha.
Tehillim,27,1, Hashem is my ohr and Yishi (my Salvation) ; whom shall I fear? Hashem is the ma'oz (stronghold) of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?
Tehillim,27,2,"When the resha'im, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to devour my basar, they stumbled and fell."
Tehillim,27,3,"Though an army should encamp against me, my lev shall not fear; though milchamah should break out against me, in this will I be confident."
Tehillim,27,4,"One thing have I asked of Hashem , that will I seek after: that I may dwell in the Bais Hashem all the days of my life, to behold the gracefulness of Hashem , and to inquire in His Heikhal."
Tehillim,27,5,For in the Yom Ra'ah (day of evil) He shall keep me safe in His Sukkah; in the shelter of His Ohel shall He conceal me; He shall set me up upon a Tzur (rock).
Tehillim,27,6,"And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies around about me; therefore will I offer in His Ohel sacrifices with shouts of joy; I will sing, yea, I will make music unto Hashem."
Tehillim,27,7,"Shema, Hashem , when I call with my voice; chaneini also upon me, and answer me."
Tehillim,27,8,"When my lev said of Thee, Seek ye My face, my lev said unto Thee, Thy face, Hashem , will I seek."
Tehillim,27,9,"Hide not Thy face far from me; turn not Thy eved away in anger; Thou hast been my ezer; leave me not, neither forsake me, Elohei Yishi (G-d of my Salvation)."
Tehillim,27,10,"When avi and immi forsake me, then Hashem will take me up."
Tehillim,27,11,"Teach me Thy Derech, Hashem , and lead me in a plain path, because of mine enemies."
Tehillim,27,12,"Deliver me not over unto the desire of mine enemies; for edei sheker are risen up against me, and such as breathe out chamas."
Tehillim,27,13,Did I not believe to see Hashem ʼs goodness in the Eretz Chayyim!
Tehillim,27,14,"Wait for Hashem : Chazak! And strengthen thine lev. Wait, I say, for Hashem."
Tehillim,28,1,"Unto Thee will I cry, Hashem my Tzur; do not turn a deaf ear to me: lest, if Thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit."
Tehillim,28,2,"Shema (hear) kol (voice) of my supplications, when I cry unto Thee, when I lift up my hands toward Thy Devir Kodesh (Innermost Sanctuary, Kodesh HaKodashim)."
Tehillim,28,3,"Draw me not away with the resha'im, and with the workers of iniquity, which speak shalom to their neighbors, but malice is in their hearts."
Tehillim,28,4,"Give to them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their endeavors; give them after the work of their hands; render to them their gemul (deserts)."
Tehillim,28,5,"Because they regard not the Pe'ulot Hashem , nor the Ma'aseh of His hands, He shall tear them down, and not build them up."
Tehillim,28,6,"Baruch Hashem , because He hath heard the kol (voice) of my supplications."
Tehillim,28,7," Hashem is my strength and my mogen; my lev trusts in Him, and I am helped; therefore my lev greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I thank Him."
Tehillim,28,8," Hashem is their oz (strength) , and He is the Ma'oz Yeshu'ot (saving refuge) of His Moshiach."
Tehillim,28,9,"Save Thy people, and bless Thine nachalah; shepherd them also, and carry them ad olam."
Tehillim,29,1,"Ascribe unto Hashem , O ye bnei elim (sons of the mighty) , ascribe unto Hashem kavod and oz (strength)."
Tehillim,29,2,Ascribe unto Hashem the Kavod Shmo; worship Hashem in the Hadrat Kodesh (beauty of holiness).
Tehillim,29,3,The voice of Hashem is upon the waters; El HaKavod thundereth; Hashem is over the mayim rabbim.
Tehillim,29,4,The voice of Hashem is in Ko'ach; the voice of Hashem is in hadar (majesty).
Tehillim,29,5,The voice of Hashem breaketh the cedars; Hashem breaketh the cedars of the Levanon.
Tehillim,29,6,"He maketh them also to skip like an egel (calf) ; Levanon and Siryon, like a young reimim (wild ox)."
Tehillim,29,7,The voice of Hashem hews out with flashes of eish.
Tehillim,29,8,The voice of Hashem shaketh the midbar; Hashem shaketh the Midbar Kadesh.
Tehillim,29,9,"The voice of Hashem causes the deer to calve, and strips bare the ye'arot (forests) ; and in His Heikhal doth everyone say, Kavod!"
Tehillim,29,10," Hashem sitteth upon the mabbul (flood) ; yea, Hashem sitteth enthroned as Melech l'olam."
Tehillim,29,11, Hashem will give oz (strength) unto His people; Hashem will bless His people with shalom.
Tehillim,30,1,"I will exalt Thee, Hashem , for Thou hast lifted me up, and hast not made my foes to gloat over me."
Tehillim,30,2," Hashem Elohai, I cried unto Thee, and Thou hast healed me."
Tehillim,30,3," Hashem , Thou hast brought up my nefesh from Sheol; Thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit."
Tehillim,30,4,"Sing unto Hashem , O ye chasidim of His, and give thanks to His Zekher Kodesh."
Tehillim,30,5,"For His anger endureth but a rega; in His favor is Chayyim; weeping may endure for an erev, but joy cometh in the boker."
Tehillim,30,6,"And in my shalvah (security) I said, I shall never be moved."
Tehillim,30,7," Hashem , by Thy favor Thou hast made my mountain to stand firm; Thou didst hide Thy face, and I was troubled."
Tehillim,30,8,"I cried to Thee, Hashem ; and unto Adonoi I made supplication."
Tehillim,30,9,"What profit is there in my dahm, in my going down into the pit? Shall the aphar (dust) praise Thee? Shall it declare Thy emes?"
Tehillim,30,10,"Shema, Hashem , and channeini; Hashem , be Thou my helper."
Tehillim,30,11,"Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing; Thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with simcha;"
Tehillim,30,12,"That kavod (my glory, my soul) may sing praise to Thee, and not be silent. Hashem Elohai, I will give thanks unto Thee l'olam."
Tehillim,31,1,"In Thee, Hashem , do I take refuge; let me never be put to shame; deliver me in Thy tzedakah."
Tehillim,31,2,"Incline Thine ear to me; deliver me speedily; be Thou for me a Tzur Ma'oz, a Bais Metzudot (fortress) to save me."
Tehillim,31,3,"For Thou art my Sela (rock) and my Metzudah (fortress) ; therefore for the sake of Thy Name, lead me, and guide me."
Tehillim,31,4,"Pull me out of the reshet (trap, net) that they have laid for me; for Thou art my ma'oz (stronghold)."
Tehillim,31,5,"Into Thine yad I commit my ruach; Thou hast redeemed me, Hashem El Emes."
Tehillim,31,6,I hate them that are the shomrim of lying vanities; but I trust in Hashem.
Tehillim,31,7,I will be glad and rejoice in Thy chesed; for Thou hast seen my affliction; Thou hast known the tzoros (troubles) of my nefesh;
Tehillim,31,8,"And hast not shut me up into the yad of the oyev (enemy) ; Thou hast set my feet in a merkhav (large place, spacious or broad place)."
Tehillim,31,9,"Channeni, Hashem , for I am in tzoros; mine eye is consumed with ka'as (grief) , my nefesh and my beten."
Tehillim,31,10,"For my life is spent with grief, and my years with groaning; my ko'ach faileth because of mine avon (iniquity) , and my atzmot waste away."
Tehillim,31,11,"I was a cherpah (reproach, scorn, disgrace) among all mine enemies, but especially among my shchenim (neighbors) , and a dread to mine acquaintance; they that did see me outside fled from me."
Tehillim,31,12,I am forgotten like a dead man out of mind; I am like a keli oved (broken vessel).
Tehillim,31,13,"For I have heard the dibbah (evil report, slander) of many; terror was on every side; while they conspire against me, they plot to take my nefesh."
Tehillim,31,14,"But I trust in Thee, Hashem ; I said, Thou art Elohai."
Tehillim,31,15,"My times are in Thy yad; deliver me from the yad of mine oyevim (enemies) , and from them that persecute me."
Tehillim,31,16,Make Thy face to shine upon Thy eved; hoshi'eini (save me) for the sake of Thy chesed.
Tehillim,31,17,"Let me not be put to shame, Hashem ; for I have called upon Thee; let the resha'im be put to shame, and let them keep silent in Sheol."
Tehillim,31,18,Let the siftei sheker (lying lips) be put to silence; which speak insolent things with ga'avah (pride) and contemptuously against the tzaddik.
Tehillim,31,19,"Oh how great is Thy goodness, which Thou hast stored up for them that fear Thee; which Thou hast wrought for them that take refuge in Thee before the Bnei Adam!"
Tehillim,31,20,"Thou shalt hide them b'seter (in the shelter) of Thy presence from the intrigues of ish; Thou shalt keep them safe in a sukkah from the riv l'shonot (the strife of tongues, contentious lashon hora, backbiting, slander)."
Tehillim,31,21,Baruch Hashem ! For He hath showed me His wondrous chesed in an Ir Matzor (besieged city).
Tehillim,31,22,"For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before Thine eyes; nevertheless Thou heardest the voice of my tachanun (supplications) when unto Thee I cried for help."
Tehillim,31,23,"O love Hashem , all ye His Chasidim; for Hashem preserveth the emunim (the faithful ones) , but He pays back in full the oseh ga'avah (the one acting in pride, haughtily)."
Tehillim,31,24,"Chazak! Be strong, let your levav take courage, all ye that hope in Hashem."
Tehillim,32,1,"Ashrei is he whose peysha (rebellion) is forgiven, whose chata'ah (sin) is covered."
Tehillim,32,2,"Ashrei is the adam unto whom Hashem imputeth not avon (iniquity) , and in whose ruach there is no remiyyah (guile, deceit)."
Tehillim,32,3,"When I kept silent, my atzmot wasted away through my groaning kol hayom (all the day)."
Tehillim,32,4,For yomam valailah Thy yad was heavy upon me; my strength was sapped as by the droughts of kayitz (summer) . Selah
Tehillim,32,5,"I acknowledge my chattat unto Thee, and mine avon (iniquity) have I not covered up. I said, I will confess my peysha'im (rebellions) unto Hashem ; and Thou forgavest the avon (iniquity) of my chattat. Selah"
Tehillim,32,6,Therefore shall every Chasid pray unto Thee in a time when Thou mayest be found; surely in the floods of mayim rabbim they shall not overtake him.
Tehillim,32,7,"Thou art my seter (hiding place, shelter) ; Thou shalt preserve me from tzoros; Thou shalt envelop me with songs of deliverance. Selah"
Tehillim,32,8,I will instruct thee and teach thee in the Derech which thou shalt go; I will counsel thee with Mine eye.
Tehillim,32,9,"Be ye not like the sus, or like the pered (mule) , which have no binah; whose mouth must be harnassed with bit and bridle, else they come not near thee."
Tehillim,32,10,"Many sorrows shall be to the resha'im, but he that trusteth in Hashem , chesed shall envelop and cover him."
Tehillim,32,11,"Be glad in Hashem , and rejoice, ye tzaddikim; and shout for joy, all ye yishrei lev (upright in heart)."
Tehillim,33,1,"Sing with joy in Hashem , O ye tzaddikim; for tehillah is fitting for the yesharim (upright ones)."
Tehillim,33,2,Hodu l' Hashem with kinnor (harp) ; make music unto Him with the ten stringed nevel (lyre).
Tehillim,33,3,Sing unto Him a shir chadash (new song) ; play skillfully with a teru'ah (shout of joy).
Tehillim,33,4,For the Devar Hashem is yashar; and kol ma'aseihu (all His deeds) are done in emunah (faithfulness).
Tehillim,33,5,He loveth Tzedakah and Mishpat; ha'aretz is full of the chesed Hashem.
Tehillim,33,6,By the Devar Hashem were Shomayim made; and all the tz'va (host) of them by the ruach (breath) of His mouth.
Tehillim,33,7,"He gathereth the mey hayam (waters of the sea) like a mound; He layeth up the tehomot (ocean depths) in otzarot (storehouses, vaults)."
Tehillim,33,8,Let kol ha'aretz fear Hashem ; let kol yoshvei tevel (all the inhabitants of the world) stand in awe of Him.
Tehillim,33,9,"For He spoke, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood firm."
Tehillim,33,10, Hashem annuls the atzat Goyim (plan of the Goyim) ; He foils the machsh'vot Amim (schemes of the peoples).
Tehillim,33,11,"The atzat Hashem standeth firm l'olam, the machsh'vot of His lev l'dor va'dor (from generation to generation)."
Tehillim,33,12,Ashrei is the Goy whose Elohav is Hashem ; and HaAm whom He hath chosen for His own nachalah.
Tehillim,33,13, Hashem looketh down from Shomayim: He beholdeth kol Bnei HaAdam.
Tehillim,33,14,From the place of His habitation He looketh upon kol yoshvei ha'aretz.
Tehillim,33,15,He formeth their hearts yachad; He considereth all their ma'asim (deeds).
Tehillim,33,16,There is no melech saved by the multitude of an army; a gibbor is not delivered by rav ko'ach.
Tehillim,33,17,"A sus is a sheker (vain, false thing) for teshu'ah (deliverance, salvation, safety) ; neither shall it save any by its great strength."
Tehillim,33,18,"Hinei, the eye of Hashem is upon them that fear Him, upon them that hope in His chesed;"
Tehillim,33,19,"To deliver their nefesh from mavet (death) , and to keep them alive in ra'av (famine)."
Tehillim,33,20,Our nefesh waiteth for Hashem ; He is ezreinu (our help) and moginneinu (our shield).
Tehillim,33,21,"For libeinu (our heart) shall rejoice in Him, because we have trusted b'Shem Kadsho (in His holy Name)."
Tehillim,33,22,"Let Thy chesed, Hashem , be upon us, even as we have hoped in Thee."
Tehillim,34,1,I will make a bracha of praise unto Hashem at all times; His praise shall continually be in my mouth.
Tehillim,34,2,"My nefesh shall make its boast in Hashem ; the anavim (humble) shall hear thereof, and be glad."
Tehillim,34,3,"O magnify Hashem with me, and let us exalt Shmo together."
Tehillim,34,4,"I sought Hashem , and He heard me, and delivered me from all my fears."
Tehillim,34,5,"They looked unto Him, and were radiant; and their panim were not ashamed."
Tehillim,34,6,"The oni (poor man) cried, and Hashem heard him, and saved him out of all his tzoros."
Tehillim,34,7,"The Malach Hashem encampeth round about them that fear Him, and delivereth them."
Tehillim,34,8,O taste and see that Hashem is tov; ashrei is the man that taketh refuge in Him.
Tehillim,34,9,"O fear Hashem , ye His Kedoshim; for there is no lack to them that fear Him."
Tehillim,34,10,"The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger; but they that seek Hashem shall not lack any good thing."
Tehillim,34,11,"Come, ye banim, pay heed unto me; I will teach you the fear of Hashem."
Tehillim,34,12,"What ish is he that desireth chayyim, and loveth many days, that he may see tov?"
Tehillim,34,13,"Keep thy tongue from rah, and thy lips from speaking mirmah."
Tehillim,34,14,"Depart from rah, and do tov; seek shalom, and pursue it."
Tehillim,34,15,"The eyes of Hashem are upon the tzaddikim, and His ears open to their cry."
Tehillim,34,16,"The face of Hashem is against them that do rah, to cut off the zekher (remembrance) of them from ha'aretz."
Tehillim,34,17,"The tzaddikim cry, and Hashem heareth, and delivereth them out of all their tzoros."
Tehillim,34,18, Hashem is near unto them whose lev is broken; and saveth such whose ruach is contrite.
Tehillim,34,19,Many are the afflictions of the tzaddik; but Hashem delivereth him out of them all.
Tehillim,34,20,He keepeth shomer over all his bones; not one of them is broken.
Tehillim,34,21,Evil shall slay the resha'im; and they that hate the tzaddik shall be desolate.
Tehillim,34,22, Hashem redeemeth the nefesh of His avadim; and none of them that take refuge in Him shall be condemned.
Tehillim,35,1,"Contend, Hashem , with them that contend with me; fight against them that fight against me."
Tehillim,35,2,Take hold of mogen and tzinnah (large shield) and arise to my aid.
Tehillim,35,3,"Draw out also the khanit (spear) , and block the way against them that persecute me; say unto my nefesh, I am Thy Yeshu'ah (salvation)."
Tehillim,35,4,Let them be put to shame and disgraced that seek after my nefesh; let a rout in retreat be theirs and let them be brought to dismay that plot my ruin.
Tehillim,35,5,Let them be like motz (chaff) before the ruach; and let the Malach Hashem drive them away.
Tehillim,35,6,Let their derech be choshech and slippery; and let the Malach Hashem pursue them.
Tehillim,35,7,"For without cause have they hid for me their reshet (net) in a shachat (pit) , which without cause they dug for my nefesh."
Tehillim,35,8,Let sho'ah (disaster) come upon him unawares; and let his own reshet (net) that he hath hid ensnare him; into that very sho'ah let him fall.
Tehillim,35,9,And my nefesh shall rejoice in Hashem ; it shall be joyful in His Yeshu'ah (salvation).
Tehillim,35,10,"All my atzmot shall say, Hashem , mi khamocha (who is like Thee) , Who deliverest the oni (poor) from him that is too strong for him, yes, the oni and the evyon (needy) from him that despoileth him?"
Tehillim,35,11,"Edei chamas (witnesses of violence, false witnesses) rise up; they lay to my charge things, questioning me of that which I have no da'as."
Tehillim,35,12,They repay me ra'ah for tovah to the forlornness of my nefesh.
Tehillim,35,13,"But as for me, when they were choleh (ill) , my clothing was sackcloth; I humbled my nefesh with tzom (fasting) ; and my tefillah (prayer) turned back on mine own kheyk (bosom)."
Tehillim,35,14,"I went about as though he had been my re'a or ach; I bowed in sadness, as one that mourneth for his em."
Tehillim,35,15,"But at mine stumbling they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together; yes, the attackers gathered themselves together against me, and I had no da'as; they did tear at me, and ceased not:"
Tehillim,35,16,"Like chanef (hypocritical) mockers at cake, they gnashed upon me with their teeth."
Tehillim,35,17,"Adonoi, how long wilt Thou look on? Rescue my nefesh from their destructions, my yechidah (only one, my life) from the lions."
Tehillim,35,18,I will give Thee thanks in the kahal rav (great congregation) ; I will praise Thee among the mighty throng.
Tehillim,35,19,Let not them that are mine oyevim gloat over me; neither let them wink with the eye that have sinas chinom (baseless hatred) toward me.
Tehillim,35,20,"For they speak not shalom, but they scheme divrei mirmot (deceitful matters) against the rigei eretz (them that are quiet in the land)."
Tehillim,35,21,"Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it."
Tehillim,35,22,"This Thou hast seen, Hashem ; keep not silent; Adonoi, be not far from me."
Tehillim,35,23,"Stir up Thyself, and awake to my mishpat, even to my cause, Elohai and Adonoi."
Tehillim,35,24,"Vindicate me, Hashem Elohai, according to Thy tzedakah; and let them not gloat over me."
Tehillim,35,25,"Let them not say in their lev, Ah, so would we have it; let them not say, We have swallowed him up."
Tehillim,35,26,"Let them be put to shame and brought to confusion together that gloat at mine ra'ah (disaster, distress) ; let them be clothed with boshet (shame) and kelimah (dishonor, disgrace) that exalt themselves against me."
Tehillim,35,27,"Let them sing for joy, and be glad, that favor my tzedek (righteousness, vindication) ; yes, let them say tamid (continually) , Let Hashem be magnified, which hath pleasure in the shalom (welfare) of His eved."
Tehillim,35,28,And my leshon (tongue) shall speak of Thy tzedek (righteousness) and of Thy tehillah (praise) kol hayom (all the day).
Tehillim,36,1,"Peysha speaketh to the rashah within my lev, that there is no pachad Elohim (fear of G-d) before his eyes."
Tehillim,36,2,"For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his avon (iniquity) be found to be hateful."
Tehillim,36,3,"The words of his mouth are iniquity and mirmah (deceit) ; he hath ceased to be wise, and to do tov (good)."
Tehillim,36,4,He deviseth evil upon his mishkav (bed) ; he setteth himself in a derech that is not tov; he abhorreth not rah.
Tehillim,36,5,"Thy chesed, Hashem , is in HaShomayim; and Thy emunah (faithfulness) reacheth unto the clouds."
Tehillim,36,6,"Thy tzedakah is like the great mountains; Thy mishpatim are tehom rabbah (a great deep); Hashem , Thou preservest adam (man) and behemah (beast)."
Tehillim,36,7,"How precious is Thy chesed, O Elohim! Therefore the Bnei Adam find refuge under the shadow of Thy wings."
Tehillim,36,8,They shall be abundantly satisfied with the abundance of Thy Beis; and Thou shalt give them to drink of Thy river of delight.
Tehillim,36,9,For with Thee is the Makor Chayyim (fountain of life) ; in Thy Ohr shall we see ohr.
Tehillim,36,10,O continue Thy chesed unto them that know Thee; and Thy tzedakah to the yishrei lev (the ones upright of heart).
Tehillim,36,11,"Let not the regel ga'avah (foot of pride) come against me, and let not the yad of the resha'im drive me away."
Tehillim,36,12,"There are the po'alei aven (workers of iniquity) fallen; they are thrown down, and shall not be able to rise."
Tehillim,37,1,"Fret not thyself because of re'im (evildoers) ; neither have thou kina (jealousy, envy) of the workers of iniquity."
Tehillim,37,2,"For they shall soon be cut down like the khatzir (grass) , and wither as the green desheh (herb, plant)."
Tehillim,37,3,"Trust in Hashem , and do tov; so shalt thou dwell in the Eretz (land) , ure'eh emunah (and thou be pastured securely)."
Tehillim,37,4,"Delight thyself also in Hashem , and He shall give thee the desires of thine lev."
Tehillim,37,5,"Commit thy derech (road, way) unto Hashem ; trust also in Him; and He shall bring it to pass."
Tehillim,37,6,"And He shall bring forth thy tzedakah (righteousness) as the ohr (light) , and thy mishpat (justice) as the tzohorayim (noonday)."
Tehillim,37,7,"Rest in Hashem , and wait patiently for Him; fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his derech, because of the ish who bringeth wicked schemes to pass."
Tehillim,37,8,"Cease from anger, and forsake chemah (wrath) ; fret not thyself in any wise to do rah."
Tehillim,37,9,"For evildoers shall be cut off; but those that wait upon Hashem , they shall inherit the Eretz (land)."
Tehillim,37,10,"For yet a little while, and the rasha shall not be; yes, thou shalt watch his place, and he will not be."
Tehillim,37,11,But the anavim (meek ones) shall inherit Eretz; and shall delight themselves in rov shalom (great peace).
Tehillim,37,12,"The rasha plotteth against the tzaddik, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth."
Tehillim,37,13,"Adonoi shall laugh at him, for He seeth that his yom is coming."
Tehillim,37,14,"The resha'im have drawn out the cherev, and have bent their keshet, to cast down the oni (poor) and evyon (needy) , and to slay such as be yishrei derech (upright ones on the road, that walk uprightly)."
Tehillim,37,15,"Their cherev shall enter into their own lev, and their keshatot (bows) shall be broken."
Tehillim,37,16,A little that a tzaddik hath is better than the riches of resha'im rabbim.
Tehillim,37,17,"For the zero'ot (arms, powers) of the resha'im shall be broken; but Hashem upholdeth the tzaddikim."
Tehillim,37,18, Hashem knoweth the yamim of the temimim (blameless ones) ; and their nachalah (inheritance) shall be l'olam (forever).
Tehillim,37,19,"They shall not be put to shame in time of evil; and in the days of famine yisba'u (they shall be satisfied, enjoy plenty)."
Tehillim,37,20,"But the resha'im shall perish, and the oyvei Hashem (enemies of Hashem) shall be like the glory of the meadows; they shall disappear like ashan (smoke) , they shall vanish."
Tehillim,37,21,"The rasha borroweth, and repayeth not; but the tzaddik showeth chonen (generosity) , and giveth."
Tehillim,37,22,For such as be blessed of Him shall inherit Eretz; and they that be cursed of Him shall be cut off.
Tehillim,37,23,"The steps of a gever (man) konanu (are ordered, made firm) by Hashem and He delighteth in his derech."
Tehillim,37,24,"Though he stumble, he shall not utterly fall; for Hashem upholdeth him with His yad (hand, power)."
Tehillim,37,25,"I have been na'ar (young) , and now am old; yet I have not seen the tzaddik forsaken, nor his zera begging lechem."
Tehillim,37,26,"He is ever chonen (generous, merciful), and lendeth; and his zera is blessed."
Tehillim,37,27,"Depart from rah, and do tov; and dwell l'olam (for evermore)."
Tehillim,37,28,"For Hashem loveth mishpat, and forsaketh not His chasidim; they are preserved l'olam; but the zera resha'im shall be cut off."
Tehillim,37,29,"The tzaddikim shall inherit Eretz, and dwell therein forever."
Tehillim,37,30,"The mouth of the tzaddik speaketh chochmah, and his leshon uttereth mishpat."
Tehillim,37,31,The torat Elohav is in his lev; no steps of his shall slip.
Tehillim,37,32,"The rashah lieth in wait to ambush the tzaddik, and seeketh to slay him."
Tehillim,37,33," Hashem will not leave him in his yad (hand, power) , nor condemn him b'hishshafto (when he is judged, brought to trial)."
Tehillim,37,34,"Wait on Hashem , and be shomer over His Derech, and He shall exalt thee to inherit Eretz; when the resha'im are cut off, thou shalt see it."
Tehillim,37,35,"I have seen the violently powerful rashah, spreading himself like an indigenous green tree."
Tehillim,37,36,"Yet he passed away, and, hinei, he was no more; yes, I sought him, but he could not be found."
Tehillim,37,37,"Mark the blameless man, and observe the yashar (upright) ; for the end of that ish is shalom."
Tehillim,37,38,"But the poshe'im (rebels, transgressors) shall be made shmad together; the latter end of the resha'im shall be cut off."
Tehillim,37,39,"But the Teshu'at Tzaddikim is of Hashem ; He is their ma'oz (stronghold, refuge) in the time of tzoros."
Tehillim,37,40,"And Hashem helps them, and delivers them; He shall deliver them from the resha'im, and save them, because they take refuge in Him."
Tehillim,38,1," Hashem , rebuke me not in Thy wrath; neither chasten me in Thy hot displeasure."
Tehillim,38,2,"For Thine khitzim (arrows) pierce me, and Thy Yad presseth upon me."
Tehillim,38,3,There is no health in my basar because of Thine anger; neither is there any shalom in my atzmot because of my chattat.
Tehillim,38,4,For mine avonot (iniquities) are gone over mine head; as a weighty massa (burden) they are too heavy for me.
Tehillim,38,5,My chaburot (wounds) are foul and festering because of my wicked folly.
Tehillim,38,6,I am bent down; I am brought low ad me'od; I go about mourning all day long.
Tehillim,38,7,For my loins are filled with burning; and there is no health in my basar.
Tehillim,38,8,I am feeble and broken ad me'od; I have groaned by reason of the disquietness of my lev.
Tehillim,38,9,"Adonoi, all my ta'avah (desire, longing) is before Thee; and my groaning is not hid from Thee."
Tehillim,38,10,"My lev panteth, my ko'ach faileth me; as for the ohr of mine eyes, it also is gone from me."
Tehillim,38,11,My loved ones and my re'a stand aloof from my nega; and my neighbors stand afar off.
Tehillim,38,12,"They also that seek after my nefesh lay snares for me; and they that seek my hurt speak of ruin, and plot mirmot (deceptions, deceits) all the day long."
Tehillim,38,13,"But I, like a cheresh (deaf man) , heard not; and I was like a mute that openeth not his mouth."
Tehillim,38,14,"Thus I was like an ish that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no tokhachot (reproofs)."
Tehillim,38,15,"For I wait for Thee, Hashem ; Thou wilt hear, Adonoi Elohai."
Tehillim,38,16,"For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should gloat over me; when my regel slippeth, they magnify themselves against me."
Tehillim,38,17,"For I am ready to fall, and my sorrow is before me tamid."
Tehillim,38,18,For I will declare mine avon; I will be in anguish over my chattat.
Tehillim,38,19,"But mine oveyim are chayyim (vigorous) , and they are strong; and they that hate me sheker (wrongfully) are multiplied."
Tehillim,38,20,They also that repay ra'ah for tovah are mine adversaries; because I pursue the thing that is tov.
Tehillim,38,21,"Forsake me not, Hashem Elohai; be not far from me."
Tehillim,38,22,"Make haste to help me, Adonoi Teshuati (L-rd of my salvation)."
Tehillim,39,1,"I said, I will be shomer over my ways, that I sin not with my leshon; I will be shomer over my mouth with a muzzle, while the rashah is before me."
Tehillim,39,2,"I was dumb with silence, I held my peace for the sake of tov; and my distress grew severe."
Tehillim,39,3,"My lev became hot within me; while I was musing the eish burned; then I spoke with my leshon,"
Tehillim,39,4," Hashem , make me to know mine end, and the measure of my yamim, what it is; that I may have da'as of how chadel (fleeting, frail) I am."
Tehillim,39,5,"Hinei, Thou hast made my yamim as a handbreadth, and mine lifespan is as nothing before Thee; verily kol adam stand as kol hevel (altogether vanity) . Selah"
Tehillim,39,6,"Surely every ish walketh in a tzel (shadow) ; surely they are in turmoil in vain; he heapeth up riches, and hath no da'as of who shall gather them."
Tehillim,39,7,"And now, Adonoi, what do I wait for? My hope is in Thee."
Tehillim,39,8,Save me from all my peysha'im; make me not the reproach of the foolish.
Tehillim,39,9,"I was silent, I opened not my mouth; because Atah (Thou) did it."
Tehillim,39,10,"Remove Thy nega (stroke, scourge) away from me; I am consumed by the blow of Thine yad."
Tehillim,39,11,"When Thou with rebukes dost correct man for avon (iniquity) , Thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely kol adam are hevel (vanity) . Selah"
Tehillim,39,12,"Hear my tefillah, Hashem , and give ear unto my cry; hold not Thy peace at my weeping; for I am a ger with Thee, and a sojourner, as were all my Avot."
Tehillim,39,13,"O spare me from Thy frown, that I may recover strength, before I depart, v'eineni (and I be no more)."
Tehillim,40,1,"I waited patiently for Hashem ; and He inclined unto me, and heard my cry."
Tehillim,40,2," Hashem brought me up also out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings."
Tehillim,40,3,"And He hath put a shir chadash in my mouth, even tehillah (hymn of praise) unto Eloheinu; many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in Hashem."
Tehillim,40,4,"Ashrei is that man that maketh Hashem his trust, and looketh not to the proud ones, nor such as turn aside to lies (false g-ds)."
Tehillim,40,5,"Many, O Hashem Elohai, are Thy wonderful works which Thou hast done, and Thy thoughts which are to us-ward; they cannot be recounted unto Thee; if I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered."
Tehillim,40,6,Zevach and minchah Thou didst not desire; mine ears hast Thou pierced; olah (burnt offering) and chata'ah (sin offering) hast Thou not required.
Tehillim,40,7,"Then said I, Hinei, I come; in the megillat sefer it is written of me,"
Tehillim,40,8,"I delight to do Thy will, O Elohai; yea, Thy torah is within my heart."
Tehillim,40,9,"I have preached tzedek in the kahal rav (great congregation) ; hinei, I have not restrained my lips, O Hashem , Thou knowest."
Tehillim,40,10,I have not hid thy tzedek within my lev; I have declared Thy emunah (faithfulness) and Thy teshuah (salvation) ; I have not concealed Thy chesed and Thy emes from the kahal rav.
Tehillim,40,11,"Withhold not Thou thy rachamim from me, O Hashem ; let Thy chesed and Thy emes continually preserve me."
Tehillim,40,12,"For innumerable evils have compassed me about; mine avonot (iniquities) have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head; therefore my lev faileth me."
Tehillim,40,13,"Be pleased, O Hashem , to deliver me; O Hashem , make haste to help me."
Tehillim,40,14,Let them be ashamed and mutually confounded that seek after my nefesh to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil.
Tehillim,40,15,"Let them be appalled because of their boshet (shame) that say unto me, Aha, aha."
Tehillim,40,16,"Let all those that seek Thee rejoice and be glad in Thee; let such as love Thy teshuah say continually, Hashem be magnified."
Tehillim,40,17,"But I am poor and needy; yet Adonoi thinketh upon me; Thou art my ezer and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O Elohai."
Tehillim,41,1,"Blessed is he that considereth the helpless; Hashem will deliver him in time of ra'ah (evil, trouble)."
Tehillim,41,2," Hashem will be shomer over him, and keep him alive; and he shall be blessed in ha'aretz; and Thou wilt not surrender him unto the desire of his enemies."
Tehillim,41,3," Hashem will support him upon the sickbed; in his illness, all his bedridden languishing Thou wilt change."
Tehillim,41,4,"I said, Hashem , channeni (be gracious unto me) ; heal my nefesh; for I have sinned against Thee."
Tehillim,41,5,"Mine enemies speak rah (evil) of me: When will he die, and shmo (his name) perish?"
Tehillim,41,6,"And if one cometh to see me, he speaketh falsely; his lev gathereth wickedness to itself; when he goeth lachutz (outside, around) he telleth it."
Tehillim,41,7,All that hate me whisper together against me; against me do they devise my hurt.
Tehillim,41,8,"A thing of beliya'al (a wicked fate), say they, cleaveth fast unto him, that when he lieth he shall rise up no more."
Tehillim,41,9,"Yea, mine own ish shalom (familiar friend, close friend) , in whom I trusted, which did eat of my lechem, hath lifted up his heel against me."
Tehillim,41,10,"But Thou, O Hashem , channeni (be gracious, merciful unto me) , and raise me up, that I may repay them."
Tehillim,41,11,"By this I know that Thou favorest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me."
Tehillim,41,12,"And as for me, Thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before Thy face l'olam (forever)."
Tehillim,41,13,Baruch Hashem Elohei Yisroel m'haolam v'ad haolam. Omein and Omein.
Tehillim,42,1,"As the deer panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my nefesh after Thee, O Elohim."
Tehillim,42,2,"My nefesh thirsteth for Elohim, for El Chai. When shall I come and appear before Elohim?"
Tehillim,42,3,"My tears have been my lechem yomam valailah, while they continually say unto me, Where is Eloheicha?"
Tehillim,42,4,"When I remember these things, I pour out my nefesh within me; for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the Beis Elohim with the voice of rinnah and todah, with the multitude keeping Chag (holy day, pilgrim feast)."
Tehillim,42,5,"Why art thou cast down, O my nefesh? And why groanest thou within me? Hope thou in Elohim; for I shall yet give Him thanks, for He is the yeshu'ah (salvation) of my countenance and Elohai."
Tehillim,42,6,"My nefesh is cast down within me; therefore will I remember Thee from Eretz Yarden, and from Chermonʼs peaks, from Har Mitzar."
Tehillim,42,7,Tehom el Tehom ([oceanic] deep unto [oceanic] deep) calleth at the noise of Thy waterfalls; all Thy breakers and Thy billows are passed over me.
Tehillim,42,8,"Yet Hashem will command His chesed by day, and in the night His shir (song) shall be with me, my tefillah (prayer) unto the El Chayyai (G-d of my life)."
Tehillim,42,9,"I will say unto El Sali (G-d my Rock) , Why hast Thou forgotten me? Why go I mourning because of the oppression of the oyev (enemy)?"
Tehillim,42,10,"As with the crushing of my atzamot (bones) , mine tzorer (vexers, harassers) reproach me; while they say all day long unto me, Where is Eloheicha?"
Tehillim,42,11,"Why art thou cast down, O my nefesh? And why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in (wait for) Elohim; for I shall yet give Him thanks, for He is the yeshu'ah (salvation) of my countenance and Elohai."
Tehillim,43,1,"Vindicate me, O Elohim, and plead my cause against a nation lo chasid; O deliver me from the ish mirmah v'avlah (deceitful and unjust man)."
Tehillim,43,2,For Thou art the Elohei Ma'oz of me. Why dost Thou cast me off? Why must I go mourning because of the oppression of the oyev?
Tehillim,43,3,"O send out Thy Ohr and Thy Emes; let them guide me; let them bring me unto Thy Har Kodesh, and to Thy Mishkan."
Tehillim,43,4,"Then will I go unto the Mizbe'ach of Elohim, unto El my exceeding joy; yea, upon the kinnor will I praise Thee, O Elohim Elohai."
Tehillim,43,5,"Why art thou cast down, O my nefesh? And why art thou disquieted within me? Hope in Elohim; for I shall yet praise Him, Who is the Yeshu'ot of my countenance, and Elohai."
Tehillim,44,1,"We have heard with our oznayim, O Elohim, Avoteinu have told us, what po'al (work) Thou hast wrought in their days, in the times of old."
Tehillim,44,2,"How Thou didst drive out the Goyim with Thy Yad, but plantedst them; how Thou didst afflict the people, but for them Thou madest room."
Tehillim,44,3,"For they got not eretz in possession by their own cherev, neither did their own zero'a save them, but Thy Yamin (Right Hand) , and Thine Zero'a, and the ohr (light) of Thy countenance, because Thou favored them."
Tehillim,44,4,"Thou art my Melech, O Elohim; command yeshu'ot (deliverances) for Ya'akov."
Tehillim,44,5,Through Thee will we push down our enemies; through Thy Shem will we trample them under that rise up against us.
Tehillim,44,6,"For I will not trust in my keshet (bow) , neither shall my cherev save me."
Tehillim,44,7,"But Thou hast saved us from tzareinu (our enemies) , and hast put them to shame that hated us."
Tehillim,44,8,"In Elohim we boast kol hayom, and praise Thy Shem l'olam (forever) . Selah"
Tehillim,44,9,"But Thou hast cast off, and disgraced us; and goest not forth with tzivoteinu (our armies)."
Tehillim,44,10,Thou makest us to turn back from before the tzar (enemy) ; and they which hate us have taken plunder for themselves.
Tehillim,44,11,Thou hast given us up like tzon appointed for food; and hast scattered us among the Goyim.
Tehillim,44,12,"Thou sellest Amecha (Thy People) for a mere nothing, and art not enriched by their price."
Tehillim,44,13,"Thou makest us a cherpah (reproach) to our shchenim (neighbors) , a scorn and a derision to them that are all around us."
Tehillim,44,14,"Thou makest us a mashal (byword) among the Goyim, a shaking of the rosh among the peoples."
Tehillim,44,15,"Kol hayom my dishonor is continually before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me,"
Tehillim,44,16,At the voice of him that reproacheth and revileth; by reason of the oyev (enemy) and avenger.
Tehillim,44,17,"All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten Thee, neither have we dealt falsely in Thy Brit."
Tehillim,44,18,"Libenu (our heart) is not turned back, neither have our steps departed from Thy way;"
Tehillim,44,19,"Though Thou hast crushed us in the makom (place, home, haunt) of jackals, and covered us with the tzalmavet (shadow of death)."
Tehillim,44,20,"If we have forgotten the Shem of Eloheinu, or stretched out our palms to an el zar (foreign g-d);"
Tehillim,44,21,Shall not Elohim search this out? For He knoweth the secrets of the lev.
Tehillim,44,22,"Yes, for Thy sake are we killed kol hayom; we are counted as tzon (sheep) for the tivchah (slaughter)."
Tehillim,44,23,"Awake. Why sleepest Thou, Adonoi? Arise, cast us not off lanetzach (forever)."
Tehillim,44,24,"Why hidest Thou Thy face, and forgettest our oni (misery, affliction) and our oppression?"
Tehillim,44,25,"For our nefesh is bowed down to the aphar (dust) ; our beten (belly, body) has deveykus with the dirt."
Tehillim,44,26,"Arise for our help, and redeem us for the sake of Thy chesed."
Tehillim,45,1,"My lev is stirred with davar tov; I speak my verses to HaMelech; my leshon (tongue) is the et (pen, stylus) of a sofer mahir (ready scribe, skillful writer)."
Tehillim,45,2,"Thou art fairer than Bnei Adam; chen (grace, favor) is poured upon Thy sfatayim (lips) ; therefore Elohim hath blessed Thee l'olam."
Tehillim,45,3,"Gird Thy cherev upon Thy side, O Gibbor, with Thy hod (glory, splendor) and Thy hadar (majesty)."
Tehillim,45,4,And in Thy hadar (majesty) ride forth victoriously for the sake of emes and anavah and tzedek; and Thy Yamin (Right Hand) shall guide Thee to nora'ot (things of awe).
Tehillim,45,5,Thine khitzim (arrows) are sharp in the lev oyvei HaMelech (in the heart of the Kingʼs enemies) ; the Amim (nations) fall under Thee.
Tehillim,45,6,"Thy kisse (throne) , O Elohim, is olam va'ed; the shevet (sceptre) of Thy Malchut is a shevet of uprightness."
Tehillim,45,7,"Thou lovest tzedek, and hatest resha; therefore Elohim, Eloheicha, hath anointed Thee with shemen sasson (the oil of gladness) above Thy chaverim."
Tehillim,45,8,"All Thy robes smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia; out of the ivory heikhalim stringed instruments have made Thee glad."
Tehillim,45,9,"Banot Melachim were among Thy ladies of honor; upon Thy Yamin (Right Hand) is stationed the Shegal (Queen consort, spouse of the reigning monarch) in golden jewelry of Ophir."
Tehillim,45,10,"Pay heed, O Bat (daughter) , and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy Bais Avi;"
Tehillim,45,11,"Then shall HaMelech be enthralled with thy beauty; since He is thy Adon, hishtachavi lo (bow to Him)."
Tehillim,45,12,And the Bat Tzor (Tyre) shall be there with a minchah (gift) ; even the ashirim (rich ones) among the people shall entreat thy favor.
Tehillim,45,13,The Bat Melech is all glorious within; her clothing is zahav embroidered.
Tehillim,45,14,"She shall be brought unto HaMelech in woven apparel; the betulot (virgins) , her companions that follow her, shall be brought unto Thee."
Tehillim,45,15,With simchah and gladness shall they be led forth; they shall enter into the Heikhal Melech.
Tehillim,45,16,"Instead of thy avot shall be thy sons, whom thou mayest make sarim (princes) in kol ha'aretz."
Tehillim,45,17,I will make Thy Shem to be remembered kol dor vador; therefore shall the Amim (nations) praise Thee l'olam va'ed.
Tehillim,46,1,"Elohim is our refuge and strength, a very present help in tzoros."
Tehillim,46,2,"Therefore we will not fear, though eretz be shaken, and though the harim (mountains) fall into the lev yamim (heart of the seas);"
Tehillim,46,3,"Though the mayim thereof roar and be troubled, though the harim shake with the surging thereof. Selah"
Tehillim,46,4,"There is a nahar (river) , the streams whereof shall make glad the Ir Elohim, the Kedosh Mishkenei Elyon (the holy dwelling of the Most High)."
Tehillim,46,5,Elohim is in the midst of it; it shall not be moved; Elohim shall help it at early boker.
Tehillim,46,6,"The Goyim raged, the kingdoms totter; He uttered His voice, eretz melted."
Tehillim,46,7, Hashem Tzva'os is with us; Elohei Ya'akov is our stronghold. Selah
Tehillim,46,8,"Come, behold the works of Hashem , what desolations He hath made in ha'aretz."
Tehillim,46,9,"He maketh milchamot to cease unto the end of ha'aretz; He breaketh the keshet (bow) , and cutteth the khanit (spear) ; He burneth the chariots in the eish."
Tehillim,46,10,"Be still, and know that I am Elohim: I will be exalted among the Goyim, I will be exalted in ha'aretz."
Tehillim,46,11, Hashem Tzva'os is with us; Elohei Ya'akov is our stronghold. Selah
Tehillim,47,1,"O clap your hands, all ye nations; shout unto Elohim with the voice of joy."
Tehillim,47,2,For Hashem Elyon is awesome; He is Melech Gadol over kol ha'aretz.
Tehillim,47,3,"He shall subdue the peoples under us, and the nations under our raglayim."
Tehillim,47,4,"He shall choose nachalateinu for us, the ga'on Ya'akov (pride, glory of Jacob) whom He loves. Selah"
Tehillim,47,5,"Elohim is ascended with a shout of joy, Hashem with the sound of a shofar."
Tehillim,47,6,"Sing praises to Elohim, sing praises; sing praises unto Malkeinu, sing praises."
Tehillim,47,7,For Melech kol ha'aretz is He; sing ye praises with understanding.
Tehillim,47,8,Elohim reigneth over the Goyim; Elohim sitteth upon the Kisse Kadsho.
Tehillim,47,9,"The princes of the nations are gathered together, even the Am Elohei Avraham; for the moginei Eretz (shields of the Earth) belong unto Elohim; He is greatly exalted."
Tehillim,48,1,"Gadol is Hashem , and greatly to be praised in the Ir Eloheinu, in His Har Kodesh."
Tehillim,48,2,"Yafeh in its loftiness, the joy of kol ha'aretz, is Mt Tziyon, on the sides of the north, the City of Melech Rav."
Tehillim,48,3,"Elohim is in her citadels, known as her fortress."
Tehillim,48,4,"For, hinei, the melachim were assembled, they advanced together."
Tehillim,48,5,"They saw, and ken (thus) they marvelled; they were troubled, and fled."
Tehillim,48,6,"Trembling took hold upon them sham (there) , and pain, as of a woman in labor."
Tehillim,48,7,Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.
Tehillim,48,8,"As we have heard, so have we seen in the Ir Hashem Tzva'os, in the Ir Eloheinu; Elohim will establish it ad olam. Selah"
Tehillim,48,9,"We meditate on Thy chesed, O Elohim, in the midst of Thy Heikhal."
Tehillim,48,10,"According to Thy Shem, O Elohim, so is Thy tehillah unto the ends of ha'aretz; Thy right hand is full of tzedek."
Tehillim,48,11,"Let Mt Tziyon rejoice, let the Banot Yehudah (Daughters of Judah) be glad, because of Thy mishpatim."
Tehillim,48,12,"Walk about Tziyon, and go around her; count the towers thereof."
Tehillim,48,13,"Mark ye well her ramparts, consider her citadels; that ye may tell it to the dor acharon."
Tehillim,48,14,For this Elohim is Eloheinu olam vaed; He will be our guide even unto death.
Tehillim,49,1,"Hear this, kol HaAmim; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the cheled (world, duration):"
Tehillim,49,2,"Bnei Adam and bnei ish, ashir (rich) and evyon (poor) alike,"
Tehillim,49,3,My mouth shall speak chochmot; and the meditation of my lev tevunot (understanding).
Tehillim,49,4,I will incline mine ear to a mashal; I will disclose my dark saying upon the kinnor (harp).
Tehillim,49,5,"Why should I fear in the days of rah, when the avon (iniquity) of my akev (supplanters, deceivers) surrounds me?"
Tehillim,49,6,"They that trust in their chayil (wealth) , and boast themselves in the rov of their oshir (riches);"
Tehillim,49,7,"A brother cannot by any means redeem ish (man) , nor give to Elohim a kofer (ransom) for him —"
Tehillim,49,8,"For the pidyon of their nefesh is costly, and is forever beyond their power to pay —"
Tehillim,49,9,"That he should live on lanetzach, and not see shachat (corruption, decay, the pit)."
Tehillim,49,10,"For he seeth that chachamim die, likewise the kesil (foolish) and the ba'ar (brutish, senseless person, dolt) perish, and leave their chayil (wealth) to others."
Tehillim,49,11,"Their inward thought is, that their batim (houses) shall continue l'olam and their mishkenot (dwelling places) l'odor vador; though they call their lands by their shmot (names)."
Tehillim,49,12,Nevertheless adam in his pomp endureth not; he is like the behemot (beasts) that perish.
Tehillim,49,13,"This is their derech, kesel (folly, imprudent confidence) is theirs; and the fate after them of those who approve their words."
Tehillim,49,14,"Like tzon they are destined for She'ol; mavet shall pasture them; and the yesharim (upright ones) shall have dominion over them in the boker; and their tzir (form) shall waste away to Sheol, so there is no dwelling place for it."
Tehillim,49,15,"But Elohim will redeem my nefesh from the yad (hand, power) of Sheol; for He shall receive me. Selah"
Tehillim,49,16,"Be not thou afraid when one is made an ish oishir, when the kavod of his bais is increased;"
Tehillim,49,17,"For in his mot (death) , he shall carry nothing away; his kavod (glory, wealth) shall not descend after him."
Tehillim,49,18,Though his nefesh during his life yevarech (he blessed) — for they praise thee when thou doest well for thyself —
Tehillim,49,19,He shall go to the dor (generation) of his avot; they shall never see ohr (light).
Tehillim,49,20,"Adam that is in his pomp, and understandeth not, is like the behemot (beasts) that perish."
Tehillim,50,1,"El Elohim, even Hashem , hath spoken, and called Eretz from the mizrach shemesh (rising of sun) unto the going down thereof."
Tehillim,50,2,"Out of Tziyon, the perfection of yofi, Elohim shineth forth."
Tehillim,50,3,"Eloheinu shall come, and shall not keep silent; an eish shall devour before Him, and it shall be tempestuous me'od round about Him."
Tehillim,50,4,"He shall summon Shomayim from above, and ha'aretz, that He may judge His people."
Tehillim,50,5,Gather My chasidim together unto Me; those that have cut a Brit (covenant) with Me by zevach (blood sacrifice).
Tehillim,50,6,And Shomayim shall declare His tzedek; for Elohim Shofet hu. Selah
Tehillim,50,7,"Hear, O My people, and I will speak; O Yisroel, and I will testify against thee; I am Elohim, even Eloheicha."
Tehillim,50,8,I will not reprove thee for thy zevakhim. And thy olot are before Me tamid.
Tehillim,50,9,"I will accept no par (bull) from thy bais, nor he-goats out of thy folds."
Tehillim,50,10,"For every beast of the ya'ar (forest) is Mine, and the behemot upon a thousand hills."
Tehillim,50,11,I know kol oph (every bird) of the harim; and the animals of the wild are Mine.
Tehillim,50,12,"If I were hungry, I would not tell thee; for the tevel is Mine, and the fulness thereof."
Tehillim,50,13,"Will I eat the basar of bulls, or drink the dahm of goats?"
Tehillim,50,14,"Sacrifice unto Elohim todah; and pay thy nedarim (vows, pledges) unto Elyon;"
Tehillim,50,15,"And call upon Me in the Yom Tzarah; I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify Me."
Tehillim,50,16,"But unto the rasha, Elohim saith, What right hast thou to declare My chukkot, or that thou shouldest take My Brit in thy mouth?"
Tehillim,50,17,"Seeing thou hatest musar (correction) , and casteth My devarim behind thee."
Tehillim,50,18,"When thou sawest a ganav (thief) , then thou consentedst with him, and hast taken thy chelek (lot) with mena'afim (adulterers)."
Tehillim,50,19,"Thou lettest loose thy mouth to ra'ah, and thy leshon frameth mirmah (deceit)."
Tehillim,50,20,Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own ben immecha.
Tehillim,50,21,"These things hast thou done, and I kept silent; thou thoughtest that I was altogether like thee; but I will reprove thee, and set the charge before thine eyes."
Tehillim,50,22,"Now consider this, ye that forget Elo'ah (G-d) , lest I tear you to pieces, and there be none to rescue."
Tehillim,50,23,Whoso offereth todah glorifieth Me; and to him that ordereth his derech aright will I show the Salvation of Elohim.
Tehillim,51,1,"Have mercy upon me, O Elohim, according to Thy chesed; according unto the multitude of Thy rachamim blot out my peysha'im (transgressions, rebellions)."
Tehillim,51,2,"Wash me thoroughly from mine avon (iniquity) , and cleanse me from my chattat (sin)."
Tehillim,51,3,"For I acknowledge my peysha'im (transgressions, rebellions) ; and my chattat (sin) is ever before me."
Tehillim,51,4,"Against Thee, Thee only, have I sinned, and done the rah in Thy sight; that Thou mightest be found just when Thou speakest, and be blameless when Thou judgest."
Tehillim,51,5,"Surely, I was brought forth in avon; and in chet did immi conceive me."
Tehillim,51,6,Surely Thou desirest emes in the inward parts; and in the inmost place Thou shalt make me to know chochmah.
Tehillim,51,7,"Purge me with ezov (hyssop) , and I shall be tahor; wash me, and I shall be whiter than sheleg (snow)."
Tehillim,51,8,Make me to hear sasson and simchah; that the atzmot which Thou hast broken may rejoice.
Tehillim,51,9,"Hide Thy face from my chatta'im, and blot out all mine avonot."
Tehillim,51,10,"Bara in me a lev tahor, O Elohim; and renew a ruach nekhon (steadfast spirit) within me."
Tehillim,51,11,Cast me not away from Thy presence; and take not Thy Ruach Hakodesh from me.
Tehillim,51,12,Restore unto me the sasson of Thy salvation; and uphold me with a ruach nedivah (a willing spirit).
Tehillim,51,13,Then will I teach poshe'im (transgressors) Thy drakhim; and chatta'im (sinners) shall be converted unto Thee.
Tehillim,51,14,"Save me from damim (bloodguiltiness) , O Elohim, Thou Elohei Teshuati; and my leshon shall sing aloud of Thy tzedakah."
Tehillim,51,15,"Adonoi, open Thou my lips; and my mouth shall show forth Thy tehillah (praise)."
Tehillim,51,16,For Thou desirest not zevach (sacrifice) ; else would I give it; Thou delightest not in olah (burnt offering).
Tehillim,51,17,"The zivkhei Elohim are a ruach nishbarah (broken spirit) ; a broken and contrite lev, O Elohim, Thou wilt not despise."
Tehillim,51,18,Do good in Thy good pleasure unto Tziyon; build Thou the chomot Yerushalayim.
Tehillim,51,19,"Then shalt Thou be pleased with zivkhei tzedek (true sacrifices, sacrifices of righteousness) , with olah (burnt offering) and whole burnt offering; then shall they offer parim (bulls) upon Thine Mizbe'ach."
Tehillim,52,1,"Why boastest thou thyself in ra'ah, O gibbor? The chesed El is kol hayom."
Tehillim,52,2,"The leshon (tongue) deviseth treachery; like a sharp ta'ar (razor) , working remiyyah (deceit)."
Tehillim,52,3,Thou lovest rah more than tov; and sheker rather than to speak tzedek. Selah
Tehillim,52,4,"Thou lovest all devouring words, O thou leshon mirmah (deceitful tongue)."
Tehillim,52,5,"El shall likewise demolish thee for netzach (eternity) , He shall break thee, and pluck thee out of thy ohel, and uproot thee out of the Eretz Chayyim. Selah"
Tehillim,52,6,"The tzaddikim also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him:"
Tehillim,52,7,"Hinei, this is the gever (man) that made not Elohim his ma'oz; but trusted in the abundance of his osher (riches) , and strengthened himself in his treachery."
Tehillim,52,8,But I am like a green zayit (olive tree) in the Beis Elohim; I trust in the chesed Elohim olam va'ed.
Tehillim,52,9,"I will give Thee thanks l'olam, because Thou hast done it; and I will wait on Shimecha; for it is tov before Thy chasidim."
Tehillim,53,1,"The naval (fool) hath said in his lev, Ein Elohim (There is no G-d) . Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity; there is none that doeth tov."
Tehillim,53,2,"Elohim looked down from Shomayim upon Bnei Adam, to see if there were any of seichel, that did seek Elohim."
Tehillim,53,3,"Every one of them has fallen away; they are altogether perverse; there is none that doeth tov, no, not echad (one)."
Tehillim,53,4,Have the workers of iniquity no da'as? Who eat up My people as they eat lechem; they have not called upon Elohim.
Tehillim,53,5,"There were they in great pachad (fear) , pachad such as never was; for Elohim hath scattered the atzmot of him that encampeth against thee; thou hast put them to shame, because Elohim hath rejected them."
Tehillim,53,6,"Oh that the Yeshu'at Yisroel would come out of Tziyon! When Elohim bringeth back the captivity of Amo (His people) , Ya'akov shall rejoice, and Yisroel shall be glad."
Tehillim,54,1,"Hoshieini (save me) , O Elohim, by Shimecha, and vindicate me by Thy gevurah (might, power)."
Tehillim,54,2,"Hear my tefillah, O Elohim; give ear to the words of my mouth."
Tehillim,54,3,"For zarim (strangers) are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my nefesh; they have not set Elohim before them. Selah"
Tehillim,54,4,"Hinei, Elohim is mine Ozer (helper) ; Adonoi is with them that uphold my nefesh."
Tehillim,54,5,He shall recompense the rah (evil) unto mine enemies; in Thy emes cut them off.
Tehillim,54,6,"I will sacrifice a nedavah (freewill offering) unto Thee; I will praise Shimecha, Hashem ; for it is tov (good)."
Tehillim,54,7,For He hath delivered me out of all my tzoros; and mine eye hath looked in triumph upon mine oyevim (enemies.)
Tehillim,55,1,"Give ear to my tefillah, O Elohim; and veil not Thyself from my techinnah (supplication)."
Tehillim,55,2,"Attend unto me, and hear me; I wander restlessly in my si'ach (anxiety) , and aloud I groan;"
Tehillim,55,3,"Because of the voice of the oyev (enemy) , because of the oppression of the rasha (evildoer) ; for they cast aven (iniquity) upon me, and in af (wrath, anger) cherish their malice against me."
Tehillim,55,4,My lev writhes within me; and the terrors of mavet are fallen upon me.
Tehillim,55,5,"Yirah va'ra'ad (fear and trembling) are come upon me, and pallatzut (horror, shuddering) overwhelmed me."
Tehillim,55,6,"And I said, Oh that I had wings like a yonah! For then would I fly away and be at rest."
Tehillim,55,7,"Hinei, then would I flee far off and lodge in the midbar. Selah"
Tehillim,55,8,I would hasten to my place of shelter from the ruach so'ah (wind of the tempest) and storm.
Tehillim,55,9,"Destroy, Adonoi, and confuse their leshon; for I see chamas (violence) and riv (strife) in the Ir (city)."
Tehillim,55,10,Yomam and lailah they go about her upon the chomot thereof; aven also and amal are in the midst of her.
Tehillim,55,11,"Ruin is in the midst thereof; oppression and mirmah (guile, fraud, deceit) depart not from her rechov."
Tehillim,55,12,For it was not an oyev (enemy) that reproached me; then I could bear it; neither was it he that had sinah (hatred) for me that did exalt himself against me; then I could have hid myself from him;
Tehillim,55,13,"But it was thou, an enosh (a man) equally, my aluf (intimate, friend) , and me'yuda'i (deep acquaintance, familiar friend)."
Tehillim,55,14,"Together we took sweet sod (intimate conversation, fellowship, counsel) , and walked unto the Beis Elohim with the throng."
Tehillim,55,15,"Let mavet seize upon them, and let them go down chayyim into Sheol; for ra'ot (evils) are in their dwellings, and among them."
Tehillim,55,16,"As for me, I will call upon Elohim; and Hashem shall save me."
Tehillim,55,17,"Erev, and boker, and at tzohorayim (noon) , will I pray, and cry aloud; and He shall hear my kol (voice)."
Tehillim,55,18,He hath redeemed my nefesh in shalom from the battle that was against me; for there were rabbim against me.
Tehillim,55,19,"El (G-d) shall hear, and afflict them, even He that abideth kedem (of old, forever) . Selah Because they do not change, therefore they fear not Elohim."
Tehillim,55,20,He hath laid his hands on such as are at shalom with him; he hath broken his Brit.
Tehillim,55,21,"The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his lev; his devarim were softer than shemen, yet they were drawn swords."
Tehillim,55,22,"Cast thy burden upon Hashem , and He shall sustain thee; He shall never suffer the tzaddik to be moved."
Tehillim,55,23,"But Thou, O Elohim, shalt bring them down into the pit of shachat; anshei damim umirmah (bloody and deceitful men) shall not live out half their yamim; but I will trust in Thee."
Tehillim,56,1,"Chaneini (be merciful) unto me, O Elohim: for enosh (man) tramples upon me; kol hayom they press their attack against me."
Tehillim,56,2,"Mine adversaries kol hayom trample me; for they be rabbim that fight against me, Marom (Most High)."
Tehillim,56,3,"What time I am afraid, I will trust in Thee."
Tehillim,56,4,In Elohim I will praise His Word. In Elohim I have put my trust; I will not fear what basar can do unto me.
Tehillim,56,5,Kol hayom they twist my words; all their machsh'vot (thoughts) are against me for rah (evil).
Tehillim,56,6,"They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they are shomer over my steps, when they wait for my nefesh."
Tehillim,56,7,"Shall they escape by iniquity? In Thine anger cast down the amim (peoples) , O Elohim."
Tehillim,56,8,"Thou hast acted as a sofer, recording my wanderings; put Thou my tears into Thy wineskin; are they not in Thy Sefer (Book)?"
Tehillim,56,9,"On the day when I cry unto Thee, then shall mine oyevim turn back; of this I have da'as; for Elohim is for me."
Tehillim,56,10,In Elohim will I praise His Word; in Hashem will I praise His Word.
Tehillim,56,11,In Elohim have I put my trust; I will not be afraid. What can adam do unto me?
Tehillim,56,12,"Thy nederim are upon me, O Elohim; I will render todot (thank offerings) unto Thee."
Tehillim,56,13,"For Thou hast delivered my nefesh from mavet (death) . Wilt not Thou deliver my feet from stumblimg, that I may walk before Elohim in the Ohr HaChayyim (the light of the living)?"
Tehillim,57,1,"Channeni, O Elohim, channeni; for my nefesh taketh refuge in Thee; yes, in the tzel (shadow) of Thy wings will I make my refuge, until these devastations pass by."
Tehillim,57,2,I will cry out unto Elohim Elyon; unto El that fulfilleth all things for me.
Tehillim,57,3,"He shall send from Shomayim, and save me from the disgrace of him that would swallow me up. Selah Elohim shall send forth His chesed (lovingkindness) and His emes (truth)."
Tehillim,57,4,"My nefesh is among lions, and I lie even among them that devour Bnei Adam, whose shinayim (teeth) are spears and khitzim (arrows) , and their leshon a sharp cherev."
Tehillim,57,5,"Be Thou exalted, O Elohim, above Shomayim; let Thy kavod be above kol ha'aretz."
Tehillim,57,6,"They have prepared a reshet (net) for my steps; my nefesh is bowed down; they have dug a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves. Selah"
Tehillim,57,7,"My lev is nachon (steadfast) , O Elohim, my lev is nachon; I will sing and make music."
Tehillim,57,8,"Awake, my kavod (glory, soul, life) ; awake, nevel and kinnor; I myself will awake the shachar (dawn)."
Tehillim,57,9,"I will give thanks unto Thee, Adonoi, among the peoples; I will sing of Thee among the peoples."
Tehillim,57,10,"For Thy chesed is gadol unto Shomayim, and Thy emes unto the heights."
Tehillim,57,11,"Be Thou exalted, O Elohim, above Shomayim; let Thy kavod be above kol ha'aretz (all the earth)."
Tehillim,58,1,"Do ye indeed decree tzedek, O elim (g-ds)? Do ye judge uprightly the Bnei Adam?"
Tehillim,58,2,"No, in lev (heart) ye work wickedness; ye weigh out the chamas (violence) of your hands in Ha'Aretz."
Tehillim,58,3,"The resha'im are perverted from the rekhem (womb) ; gone astray from birth are they, speaking kazav (lie, falsehood)."
Tehillim,58,4,Their venom is like the venom of a nachash; they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth its ear;
Tehillim,58,5,"That it may not pay heed to the voice of charmers, casting spells ever so cunningly."
Tehillim,58,6,"Break their teeth, O Elohim, in their mouth; tear out the fangs of the young lions, Hashem."
Tehillim,58,7,"Let them melt away like draining mayim; when he bendeth his bow to shoot his khitzim (arrows) , let them be crumbled to pieces."
Tehillim,58,8,"As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away; like the stillborn child of an isha, that they may not see the shemesh."
Tehillim,58,9,"Before your sirot (pots) can feel the burning thorns, may He with a whirlwind blow them away, both green and dry alike."
Tehillim,58,10,The tzaddik shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance; he shall wash feet in the dahm harasha.
Tehillim,58,11,"So that adam shall say, Verily there is a reward for the tzaddik; verily yesh Elohim Shofetim ba'aretz (there is a G-d that judgeth in the earth)."
Tehillim,59,1,"Save me from mine enemies, O Elohai; protect me from them that rise up against me."
Tehillim,59,2,"Deliver me from the po'alei aven (workers of iniquity) , and save me from anshei damim (bloody men)."
Tehillim,59,3,"For, hinei, they lie in wait for my nefesh; the fierce stir up strife against me; not for my peysha, nor for my chattat, Hashem."
Tehillim,59,4,"They run and prepare themselves without my avon (wrong, fault) ; awake to help me, and see."
Tehillim,59,5,"Thou therefore, Hashem Elohim Tzva'os, Elohei Yisroel, rouse Thyself to visit kol HaGoyim; be not merciful to any bogedei aven (wicked boged). Selah"
Tehillim,59,6,"They return at erev; they growl like a kelev (dog) , and prowl around the Ir."
Tehillim,59,7,"Hinei, they belch out with their mouth; charavot (swords) are in their sfatot (lips) ; for who, say they, doth hear?"
Tehillim,59,8,"But Thou, Hashem , shalt laugh at them; Thou shalt have all the Goyim in derision."
Tehillim,59,9,"O my Strength, I will be shomer to watch for Thee; for Elohim is my stronghold."
Tehillim,59,10,The G-d of my chesed shall come to meet me; Elohim shall let me see [the end] of my shorer (watchers).
Tehillim,59,11,"Slay them not, lest my people forget; scatter them by Thy power; and bring them down, Adonoi mogineinu (our Shield)."
Tehillim,59,12,For the chattat of their mouth and the davar of their sfatayim let them even be caught in their ga'on (pride) ; and for the cursing and lying which they speak.
Tehillim,59,13,"Consume them in chemah (wrath) , consume them, till they are no more; and let them know that Elohim ruleth in Ya'akov unto the ends of ha'aretz. Selah"
Tehillim,59,14,"And at erev let them return; and let them growl like a kelev, and prowl around the Ir."
Tehillim,59,15,"Let them wander up and down for okhel (food) , and howl if they be not satisfied."
Tehillim,59,16,"But I will sing of Thy oz; yes, I will sing aloud of Thy chesed in the boker; for Thou hast been my stronghold and refuge in the day of my tzoros."
Tehillim,59,17,"Unto Thee, O my Strength, will I sing; for Elohim is my strongold, and the Elohim of my chesed."
Tehillim,60,1,"O Elohim, Thou hath rejected us, scattered us; Thou hast been angry; O restore us!"
Tehillim,60,2,"Thou hast made eretz to tremble; Thou hast torn it asunder, heal the fractures thereof; for it tottereth."
Tehillim,60,3,"Thou hast showed Thy people kashah (hard times) ; Thou hast made us to drink the yayin of tarelah (bewilderment, reeling)."
Tehillim,60,4,"Thou hast set up a nes (banner) to them that fear Thee, that it may be unfurled on account of the truth. Selah"
Tehillim,60,5,That Thy Yedidot (beloved ones) may be saved; save with Thy Yamin (Right Hand) and hear me.
Tehillim,60,6,"Elohim hath spoken in His Kodesh (Holiness) ; I will exult, I will parcel Shechem as chelek, and measure out the Valley of Sukkot."
Tehillim,60,7,"Gil'ad is Mine, and Menasheh is Mine; Ephrayim also is the ma'oz of Mine Rosh; Yehudah is My Mekhokek (prescriber of laws, lawgiver)."
Tehillim,60,8,Moav is My washpot; over Edom will I cast My sandal; over Philistia I shout in triumph.
Tehillim,60,9,Who will bring me to the Ir Matzon (city of fortification) ? Who will bring me to Edom?
Tehillim,60,10,"Wilt not Thou, O Elohim, which hadst cast us off? And Thou, O Elohim, which didst not go out with tzivoteinu (our armies)?"
Tehillim,60,11,"Give us help against the enemy; for vain is the teshuat adam (help, salvation of or from Man)."
Tehillim,60,12,"In Elohim shall we obtain the victory; for He it is that shall tread down tzareinu (our enemies, oppressors)."
Tehillim,61,1,"Hear my cry, Elohim; attend unto my tefillah."
Tehillim,61,2,"From the end of ha'aretz will I call unto Thee, when my lev is overwhelmed; lead me to the Tzur that is higher than I."
Tehillim,61,3,"For Thou hast been a refuge for me, and a migdal oz (tower of strength) from the enemy."
Tehillim,61,4,I will abide in Thy ohel forever; I will take refuge in the covert of Thy wings. Selah
Tehillim,61,5,"For Thou, Elohim, hast heard my nederim; Thou hast given me the yerushat yirei Shemecha (inheritance of those that fear Thy Name)."
Tehillim,61,6,"Thou wilt prolong days of the Melech, and his shanot dor vador."
Tehillim,61,7,"He shall abide before Elohim forever; O appoint chesed and emes, to preserve him."
Tehillim,61,8,"So will I sing praise unto Shimecha forever, that I may yom yom (daily) perform my nederim."
Tehillim,62,1,Truly my nefesh waiteth silently upon Elohim; from Him cometh my Yeshu'ah (salvation).
Tehillim,62,2,Truly He is my Tzur and my Yeshu'ah (salvation) ; He is my stronghold; I shall not be greatly shaken.
Tehillim,62,3,"How long will ye rush to attack an ish? To thrust at, all of you, as at a leaning kir (wall) , and as at a tottering gader (fence)."
Tehillim,62,4,"Truly they consult to bring down a person of prominence; they delight in kazav (lie, falsehood, deceptive thing) ; they make a brocha with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah"
Tehillim,62,5,"Truly in Elohim wait silently, my nefesh, for my tikvah (hope) is from Him."
Tehillim,62,6,Truly He is my Tzur and my Yeshu'ah (salvation) ; He is my stronghold; I shall not be shaken.
Tehillim,62,7,"In Elohim is my salvation and my Kavod: the Tzur of my strength, and my refuge, is in Elohim."
Tehillim,62,8,"Trust in Him at all time; ye people, pour out your lev before Him; Elohim is a refuge for us. Selah"
Tehillim,62,9,"Truly Bnei Adam (those of low estate) are hevel (vanity) , and Bnei Ish (those who are highborn) are kazav (a lie) ; they go up in the balances; they are altogether lighter than hevel (vanity)."
Tehillim,62,10,"Trust not in oshek (oppression, extortion) and become not vain in gazel (the thing taken as plunder) ; if riches increase, set not your lev upon them."
Tehillim,62,11,Elohim hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that oz (strength) belongeth unto Elohim.
Tehillim,62,12,"Also unto Thee, Adonoi, belongeth chesed; for Thou renderest to ish (every man) according to his ma'asim (deeds)."
Tehillim,63,1,"O Elohim, Thou art Eli; early will I seek Thee; my nefesh thirsteth for Thee; my basar longeth for Thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no mayim is,"
Tehillim,63,2,"To see Thy oz (might, power) and Thy kavod, as I have beheld Thee in the Kodesh (holy place, sanctuary, Mikdash)."
Tehillim,63,3,"Because Thy chesed is better than chayyim, my lips shall praise Thee."
Tehillim,63,4,Thus will I bless Thee while I live; I will lift up my hands b'Shimcha (in Thy Name.)
Tehillim,63,5,My nefesh shall be satisfied as with chelev (fat) and deshen (abundance) ; and my mouth shall praise Thee with lips of joyful singing;
Tehillim,63,6,"When I remember Thee upon my bed, and meditate on Thee in the ashmurot (night watches)."
Tehillim,63,7,"Because Thou hast been my help, therefore in the tzel (shadow) of Thy wings will I sing with joy."
Tehillim,63,8,My nefesh followeth hard after Thee; Thy Yamin (Right Hand) upholdeth me.
Tehillim,63,9,"But those that seek my nefesh, to destroy it, shall go into the abysses of ha'aretz."
Tehillim,63,10,They deliver him into the power of the cherev; they shall be a portion for jackals.
Tehillim,63,11,But HaMelech shall rejoice in Elohim; every one that sweareth by Him shall glory; but the mouth of them that speak sheker shall be stopped.
Tehillim,64,1,"Hear my voice, O Elohim, in my si'akh (complaint) ; preserve my life from the pachad (terror) of the oyev (enemy)."
Tehillim,64,2,"Hide me from the sod (secret counsel, conspiracy) of the re'im; from the rigshah (insurrection, noisy crowd, assembly) of the workers of iniquity;"
Tehillim,64,3,"Who whet their tongue like a cherev, and aim their khitzim (arrows) , even davar mar (bitter words);"
Tehillim,64,4,"That they may shoot in secret at the tam (innoent) ; pitom (suddenly) do they shoot at him, and fear not."
Tehillim,64,5,"They encourage themselves in a davar rah (an evil plan) ; they speak in order to set mokshim (snares, hidden traps) ; they say, Who shall see them?"
Tehillim,64,6,"Or search out their iniquities? They have accomplished a cunningly devised plot; for the mind of ish (man) and the lev (heart) are deep,"
Tehillim,64,7,But Elohim shall shoot at them with a khetz (arrow) ; pitom (suddenly) shall their wounds be.
Tehillim,64,8,So the leshon of them will bring ruin upon them; all that see them shall shake their head.
Tehillim,64,9,"And kol adam shall fear, and shall declare the po'al Elohim (work of G-d) ; for they shall ponder His ma'aseh."
Tehillim,64,10,"The tzaddik shall be glad in Hashem , and shall take refuge in Him; and all the yishrei lev (upright of heart) shall glory."
Tehillim,65,1,"Tehillah (praise) is due Thee, O Elohim, in Tziyon; And unto Thee shall the neder (vow) be performed."
Tehillim,65,2,"O Thou that hearest tefillah (prayer) , unto Thee shall kol basar come."
Tehillim,65,3,"Divrei avonot (instances of iniquity) overwhelm me; as for peysha'einu (our transgressions) , Thou hast made kapporah for them."
Tehillim,65,4,"Ashrei is the one whom Thou choosest, and causest to come near unto Thee, that he may dwell in Thy khatzerot; we shall be satisfied with the tov of Thy Beis, even of Thy Heikhal Kodesh."
Tehillim,65,5,"By nora'ot (awesome deeds, awe-inspiring things) of tzedek (justice) wilt Thou answer us, O Elohei Yish'einu (G-d of our salvation) ; Who art the hope of all the ends of eretz, and of them that are on the farthest seas;"
Tehillim,65,6,"Which by His ko'ach established the harim (mountains) , being girded with gevurah;"
Tehillim,65,7,"Which stilleth the roar of the seas, the roar of their waves, and the tumult of the Amim (peoples, nations)."
Tehillim,65,8,They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at Thy otot (signs) ; Thou makest the outgoing exits of boker and erev to resound with joy.
Tehillim,65,9,"Thou visitest ha'aretz, and waterest it; Thou greatly enrichest it with the peleg Elohim (fountain of G-d) , which is full of mayim; Thou preparest them dagan (grain) , for so Thou didst prepare it."
Tehillim,65,10,"Thou waterest the furrows thereof abundantly; Thou settlest the ridges thereof; Thou makest it soft with showers; Thou blessest the tzemach (sprout, branch), thereof."
Tehillim,65,11,"Thou crownest shnat tovatecha (the year with Thy goodness, bounty) ; and Thy paths drip with plenty."
Tehillim,65,12,They drip upon the pastures of the midbar; and the hills are enrobed with gladness.
Tehillim,65,13,"The meadows are clothed with tzon; the amakim (valleys) also are covered over with grain; they shout for joy, they also sing."
Tehillim,66,1,"Make a joyful shout unto Elohim, kol HaAretz;"
Tehillim,66,2,Sing forth the kavod Shmo; make kavod (glorious) His tehillah (praise).
Tehillim,66,3,"Say unto Elohim, How norah (awesome) art Thou in Thy ma'asim (works) ! Through the greatness of Thy oz (might) shall Thine oyevim cower before Thee."
Tehillim,66,4,"Kol ha'aretz shall prostrate before Thee, and shall sing unto Thee; they shall sing praise to Shimecha. Selah"
Tehillim,66,5,Come and see the works of Elohim; He is norah (awesome) in deed toward Bnei Adam.
Tehillim,66,6,He turned the yam into yabashah (dry land); they passed through the nahar on regel; there did we rejoice in Him.
Tehillim,66,7,He ruleth by His gevurah (power) olam (forever) ; His eyes are a watchmanʼs eyes over the Goyim; let not the sorerim (rebellious ones) exalt themselves. Selah
Tehillim,66,8,"Barchu Eloheinu, Amim, and make the kol (sound) of His tehillah (praise) to be heard."
Tehillim,66,9,He is the One who set nafsheinu in chayyim and does not permit ragleinu (our foot) to slip.
Tehillim,66,10,"For Thou, Elohim, hath tested us and hast proved us; Thou hast put us in the crucibleʼs refining and refined us as kesef."
Tehillim,66,11,Thou broughtest us into the metzudah (prison) ; Thou laidst a mu'akah (burden) upon our loins.
Tehillim,66,12,Thou hast caused enosh (mankind) to ride over rosheinu (our head) ; we went through eish and through mayim; but Thou broughtest us out into plenty.
Tehillim,66,13,"I will come into Thy Beis with olot; I will fulfill for Thee my nedarim,"
Tehillim,66,14,"Which my sfatayim have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in tzoros."
Tehillim,66,15,"I will offer unto Thee olot mekhim (burnt offerings of fat animals) , with the ketoret (incense, offering) of rams; I will offer bakar with goats. Selah"
Tehillim,66,16,"Come and hear, Kol Yirei Elohim, and I will declare what He hath done for my nefesh."
Tehillim,66,17,"I cried unto Him with my mouth, and He was extolled with my leshon."
Tehillim,66,18,"If I regard avon (iniquity, sin) in my lev, Adonoi will not hear me;"
Tehillim,66,19,But surely Elohim hath heard me; He hath attended to the kol tefillati (voice of my prayer).
Tehillim,66,20,"Baruch Elohim, Who hath not turned away my tefillah, nor His chesed from me."
Tehillim,67,1,"Elohim be channun (gracious) unto us, and put a brocha upon us; and may He make His face to shine upon us. Selah"
Tehillim,67,2,"That Thy Derech may be known upon HaAretz, Thy Yeshu'ah (salvation) among kol Goyim."
Tehillim,67,3,"Let the Amim praise Thee, O Elohim; let kol Amim praise Thee."
Tehillim,67,4,"O let the peoples be glad and sing for joy, for Thou shalt judge the people righteously, and govern the peoples upon HaAretz. Selah"
Tehillim,67,5,"Let the people praise Thee, O Elohim; let kol Amim praise Thee."
Tehillim,67,6,"Then shall eretz yield her yevul (increase, produce, harvest) ; and Elohim, even Eloheinu, shall put a brocha upon us."
Tehillim,67,7,Elohim shall bless us; and kol afsei aretz (all the ends of the earth) shall fear Him.
Tehillim,68,1,"Let Elohim arise, let His oyevim be scattered; let them also that hate Him flee before Him."
Tehillim,68,2,"As ashan (smoke) is blown away, so drive them away; as wax melteth before the eish, so let the resha'im perish at the presence of Elohim."
Tehillim,68,3,"But let the tzaddikim have simchah; let them rejoice before Elohim; and, let them rejoice with simchah."
Tehillim,68,4,"Sing unto Elohim, sing praises to Shmo; extol Him that rideth on the clouds by Shmo Hashem , and rejoice before Him."
Tehillim,68,5,"Avi yetomim (father of orphans) , and a dayan (judge) of almanot (widows) , is Elohim in His Ma'on Kodesh."
Tehillim,68,6,"Elohim setteth the yechidim (alone ones) in a family; He bringeth out those which are asirim (prisoners, those bound with chains) ; but the sorerim (rebels) dwell in a dry land."
Tehillim,68,7,"O Elohim, when Thou wentest forth before Thy people, when Thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah;"
Tehillim,68,8,"Eretz shook, Shomayim also poured rain at the presence of Elohim; even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of Elohim, Elohei Yisroel."
Tehillim,68,9,"Thou, O Elohim, didst send a plentiful geshem (rain) , whereby Thou didst restore Thine nachalah, when it was parched."
Tehillim,68,10,"Thy congregation hath dwelt therein; Thou, O Elohim, hast prepared of Thy bounty for the oni."
Tehillim,68,11,"Adonoi gave the word; rav (great) was the tzava (company, army) of the mevaserot (heralds, those that published it, the lady evangelists)."
Tehillim,68,12,"Melachim of tzeva'ot (armies) shall flee, they flee; and she that tarried at home shall divide the plunder."
Tehillim,68,13,"Though ye have lain among the cooking pots, yet shall ye be as the wings of a yonah covered with kesef, and her feathers with glistening gold."
Tehillim,68,14,"When Shaddai scattered melachim therein, it was white as snow in Tzalmon."
Tehillim,68,15,The Har Elohim is the Har Bashan; a mountain of peaks is the Har Bashan.
Tehillim,68,16,"Why gaze ye in envy, ye many-peaked harim? This is the har which Elohim hath chosen to dwell in; indeed, Hashem will dwell in it lanetzach (forever)."
Tehillim,68,17,"The merkavot of Elohim are myriads, a thousand thousands; Adonoi is among them, as in Sinai, in kodesh (holiness)."
Tehillim,68,18,"Thou hast ascended on marom (high) , Thou hast led captivity captive; Thou hast received mattanot among adam; yes, even from the sorerim (the rebellious) also, that Hashem Elohim might dwell."
Tehillim,68,19,"Baruch Adonoi, Who yom yom bears us up, even HaEl Yeshu'ateinu (the G-d of our salvation) . Selah"
Tehillim,68,20,Our G-d is a G-d who saves; and from Hashem Adonoi come escapes from mavet (death).
Tehillim,68,21,"But Elohim shall shatter the rosh of His oyevim, and the hairy kodkod (crown of the head, scalp) of such a one as continueth on in his trespasses."
Tehillim,68,22,"Adonoi said, I will bring back from Bashan, I will bring back from the depths of the sea;"
Tehillim,68,23,"That thy regel may be bathed in dahm, that the leshon of thy klavim (dogs) may partake of the oyevim."
Tehillim,68,24,"They have seen Thy processions, O Elohim; even the goings of my G-d, my Melech, in the Kodesh."
Tehillim,68,25,"The sharim (singers) went before, the nogenim (players on instruments) followed after; among them were the alamot (young unmarried virgins) playing timbrels."
Tehillim,68,26,"Barchu Elohim in the congregations, even Hashem , out of the Makor Yisroel (Fountain of Israel)."
Tehillim,68,27,"There is Binyamin, the youngest at the head; the sarim (princes) of Yehudah and the throng of them, the sarim (princes) of Zevulun, and the sarim (princes) of Naphtali."
Tehillim,68,28,"Eloheicha hath commanded thy oz; strengthen, O Elohim, that which Thou hast wrought for us."
Tehillim,68,29,Because of Thy Heikhal at Yerushalayim shall melachim bring offerings unto Thee.
Tehillim,68,30,"Rebuke the chayat kaneh, the adat (herd) of bulls, with the agalim (calves) of the nations, till every one prostrate himself with ingots of kesef; He scatters the people that delight in wars."

Tehillim,68,35,"O Elohim, Thou art norah (awesome, terrible) out of Thy Mikdashim; the El (G-d) of Yisroel is He that giveth oz and strength unto His people. Baruch Elohim."
Tehillim,69,1,"Hoshi'eini, O Elohim; for the mayim are come unto my nefesh."
Tehillim,69,2,"I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing; I am come into the depths of the mayim, where the floods overflow me."
Tehillim,69,3,I am weary of my crying out; my garon (throat) is dry; mine eyes fail while I wait for Elohai.
Tehillim,69,4,"They that have sinas chinom (baseless hatred) toward me are more than the hairs of mine rosh; they that would destroy me, being mine oyevim (enemies) sheker (baselessly) are mighty; then I restored that which I did not steal."
Tehillim,69,5,"O Elohim, Thou knowest my folly; and my ashmot (guiltinesses) are not hid from Thee."
Tehillim,69,6,"Let not them that wait on Thee, Adonoi Hashem Tzva'os, be ashamed because of me; let not those that seek Thee be disgraced because of me, O Elohei Yisroel."
Tehillim,69,7,Because for Thy sake I have borne cherpah; shame hath covered my face.
Tehillim,69,8,"I am become a stranger unto my achim, and a nochri (foreigner) unto the bnei immi (sons of my mother)."
Tehillim,69,9,For kinas Beitcha (zeal for Thy House) hath consumed me; and the cherpot of them that scorned Thee are fallen upon me.
Tehillim,69,10,"When I wept, and chastened my nefesh in the tzom (fast) , that became my cherpot (reproaches)."
Tehillim,69,11,I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a mashal (byword) to them.
Tehillim,69,12,They that sit in the sha'ar (gate) speak against me; and I was the neginot (drinking songs) of the drunkards.
Tehillim,69,13,"But as for me, may my tefillah be unto Thee, Hashem , in an et ratzon (acceptable time, time of favor) ; O Elohim, in the multitude of Thy chesed hear me, in the emes of Thy salvation."
Tehillim,69,14,"Save me out of the teet (mire, clay, soil) and let me not sink; let me be saved from them that hate me, and out of the depths of the mayim."
Tehillim,69,15,"Let not the floodwaters overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the be'er (pit) shut her mouth upon me."
Tehillim,69,16,"Hear me, Hashem , for Thy chesed is tov; turn unto me according to the multitude of Thy rachamim;"
Tehillim,69,17,And hide not Thy face from Thy eved; for I am in tzoros. Hear me speedily.
Tehillim,69,18,"Draw near unto my nefesh, and make the go'el redemption of it; deliver me because of mine oyevim (enemies)."
Tehillim,69,19,"Thou hast known the cherpah (scorn) I bear, and my shame, and my dishonor; mine adversaries are all before Thee."
Tehillim,69,20,"Reproach hath broken my lev; and I have sickness as unto death; and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for menachamim (comforters) , but I found none."
Tehillim,69,21,They gave me also gall in my food; and in my tzamah (thirst) they gave me chometz (vinegar) to drink.
Tehillim,69,22,"Let their shulchan become a pach (snare, trap) before them; and that which should have been for their shlomim (peacefulnesses) , let it become a mokesh (trap)."
Tehillim,69,23,"Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins shake tamid."
Tehillim,69,24,"Pour out Thine indignation upon them, and let Thy charon af (burning wrath) overtake them."
Tehillim,69,25,Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their ohalim.
Tehillim,69,26,"For they persecute him whom Thou hast struck; and they tell of the makh'ov (pain, grief) of those whom Thou hast wounded."
Tehillim,69,27,Add avon (iniquity) unto their avon; and let them not come into Thy tzedakah.
Tehillim,69,28,"Let them be blotted out of the Sefer Chayyim, and not be recorded with the tzaddikim."
Tehillim,69,29,"But I am ani (poor) and in pain; let Thy Yeshu'ah (salvation) , O Elohim, set me up on high."
Tehillim,69,30,"I will praise Shem Elohim b'shir (in song) , and will magnify Him with todah (thanksgiving)."
Tehillim,69,31,This also shall please Hashem better than shor (ox) or bull that hath keren (horn) and parsah (hoof).
Tehillim,69,32,"Those that have anavah (meekness, humility) shall see this, and have simchah; and your lev shall live that seek Elohim."
Tehillim,69,33,"For Hashem heareth the evyonim (needy ones, poor) , and despiseth not His prisoners."
Tehillim,69,34,"Let the Shomayim va'Aretz praise Him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein."
Tehillim,69,35,"For Elohim yoshi'a (will save) Tziyon, and will build the cities of Yehudah; that they may dwell there, and have it in possession."
Tehillim,69,36,The zera also of His avadim shall inherit it; and they that love Shmo shall dwell therein.
Tehillim,70,1,"Make haste, Elohim, to deliver me; make haste to help me, Hashem."
Tehillim,70,2,"Let them have bushah and be confounded that seek my nefesh; let them be turned back, and be put to confusion, that desire my hurt."
Tehillim,70,3,"Let them be turned back for a reward of their bushah that say, Aha, aha."
Tehillim,70,4,"Let all those that seek Thee rejoice and have simcha in Thee; and let such as love Thy Yeshu'ah (salvation) say continually, Let Elohim be magnified."
Tehillim,70,5,"But I am poor and needy; make haste unto me, Elohim; Thou art my help and my deliverer. Hashem , make no delay."
Tehillim,71,1,"In Thee, Hashem , do I put my trust; let me not be put to shame l'olam."
Tehillim,71,2,"Deliver me in Thy tzedakah, and cause me to escape; incline Thine ear unto me, and hoshi'eini (save me)."
Tehillim,71,3,"Be Thou Tzur Ma'on (a rock of habitation) , whereunto I may resort tamid (continually) ; Thou hast given commandment to save me; for Thou art my rock and my fortress."
Tehillim,71,4,"Deliver me, O Elohai, out of the yad of the rasha, out of the palm of the unrighteous and cruel man."
Tehillim,71,5,"For Thou art my tikveh (hope) , Adonoi Hashem ; Thou art my trust from my youth."
Tehillim,71,6,By Thee have I been upheld from the beten (womb) ; Thou art He that took me out of the womb of immi; my tehillah (praise) shall be of Thee tamid (continually).
Tehillim,71,7,I am as a mofet (portent) unto rabbim (many) ; but Thou art my strong refuge.
Tehillim,71,8,Let my mouth be filled with Thy tehillah (praise) and with Thy tiferet (glory) kol hayom.
Tehillim,71,9,Cast me not off in the time of ziknah (old age) ; forsake me not when my ko'ach faileth.
Tehillim,71,10,"For mine oyevim speak against me; and they that lay in wait for my nefesh conspire together,"
Tehillim,71,11,"Saying, Elohim hath forsaken him; persecute and lay hold of him; for there is none to rescue him."
Tehillim,71,12,"O Elohim, be not far from me; O Elohai, make haste for my help."
Tehillim,71,13,Let them be ashamed and consumed that are adversaries to my nefesh; let them be covered with cherpah (reproach) and dishonor that seek my hurt.
Tehillim,71,14,"But I will hope tamid (continually) , and will yet give tehillah to Thee more and more."
Tehillim,71,15,My mouth shall proclaim Thy tzedakah and Thy Teshuah (salvation) kol hayom; for I know not the limits thereof.
Tehillim,71,16,"I will come in the gevurot (mighty acts) of Adonoi Hashem ; I will make mention of Thy tzedakah, even of Thine only."
Tehillim,71,17,"O Elohim, Thou hast taught me from my youth; and hitherto have I declared Thy nifle'ot (wondrous works)."
Tehillim,71,18,"Now also when I am in ziknah (old age) and grayheaded, O Elohim, forsake me not; until I have declared Thy zero'a unto this generation, and Thy gevurah to everyone that is to come."
Tehillim,71,19,"Thy tzedakah also, O Elohim, is ad marom (to the heights) . Thou Who hast done gedolot (great things) ; O Elohim, mi khamocha (who is like unto Thee)?"
Tehillim,71,20,"Thou, which hast showed me great and severe tzoros, shalt revive me again, and shalt bring me up again from the tehomot (abysses) of ha'aretz."
Tehillim,71,21,"Thou shalt increase my gedolah, and comfort me on every side."
Tehillim,71,22,"I will also praise Thee with the nevel (lyre) , even Thy emes, O Elohai; unto Thee will I sing with the kinnor (harp) , O Thou Kadosh Yisroel."
Tehillim,71,23,"My lips shall shout for joy when I sing unto Thee; and my nefesh, which Thou hast purchased for redemption."
Tehillim,71,24,"My leshon also shall tell of Thy tzedakah kol hayom; for they are brought unto shame, they are humiliated that seek my hurt."
Tehillim,72,1,"Give HaMelech Thy mishpatim, O Elohim, and Thy tzedakah unto the Ben Melech."
Tehillim,72,2,"He shall judge Thy people with tzedek, and Thy poor with mishpat."
Tehillim,72,3,"The harim (mountains) shall bear shalom to the people, and geva'ot (hills) in tzedakah."
Tehillim,72,4,"He shall judge the poor of the people; yoshia (He shall save) the bnei evyon (children of the needy) , and shall break in pieces the oppressor."
Tehillim,72,5,"They shall fear Thee as long as the shemesh and yarei'ach endure, dor dorim (throughout all generations)."
Tehillim,72,6,"He shall come down like matar (rain) upon the mown field, as showers watering eretz."
Tehillim,72,7,In his yamim shall the tzaddik flourish; and abundance of shalom so long as the yarei'ach endureth.
Tehillim,72,8,"He shall have dominion also from yam to yam, and from nahar (river) unto the afsei eretz (the ends of the earth)."
Tehillim,72,9,They that dwell in the desert shall bow before him; and his oyevim (enemies) shall lick the aphar (dust).
Tehillim,72,10,The melachim of Tarshish and of the iyim (islands) shall bring minchah (tribute) ; the melachim of Sheva and Seva shall offer gifts.
Tehillim,72,11,Kol melachim shall fall down before him; kol Goyim shall serve him.
Tehillim,72,12,"For he shall deliver the evyon (needy) when he crieth; the oni (poor, afflicted) also, and him that hath no ozer (helper)."
Tehillim,72,13,"He shall pity the weak and evyon (needy) , and yoshi'a (he shall save) the nefashot of the evyonim (needy)."
Tehillim,72,14,He shall be the Go'el Redeemer of their nefesh from deceit and chamas; and precious shall their dahm be in his sight.
Tehillim,72,15,"And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the zahav of Sheva; and prayer shall be for him continually; and daily shall a brocha be made on him."
Tehillim,72,16,There shall be an abundance of grain on ha'aretz upon the top of the harim (mountains) ; the fruit thereof shall shake Levanon; and they of the city shall flourish like esev ha'aretz.
Tehillim,72,17,Shmo (His Name) shall endure l'olam; Shmo shall be continued as long as the shemesh; and men shall be blessed in him; kol Goyim shall call him blessed.
Tehillim,72,18,"Baruch Hashem Elohim, Elohei Yisroel, who only doeth nifla'ot (wondrous things)."
Tehillim,72,19,"And baruch Shem kevodo l'olam (and blessed be His Glorious Name forever) ; and let the whole earth be filled with His glory. Omein, and Omein."
Tehillim,72,20,The tefillot Dovid Ben Yishai are ended.
Tehillim,73,1,"Truly Elohim is tov to Yisroel, even to the barei levav (pure of heart)."
Tehillim,73,2,"But as for me, my raglayim had almost stumbled; my steps had well near slipped."
Tehillim,73,3,"For I had kina (envy) of the holelim (arrogant ones) , when I saw the shalom of the resha'im."
Tehillim,73,4,"For there are no chartzubot (fetters, bonds, pains) in their mot; healthy is their belly."
Tehillim,73,5,They are not in amal (trouble) as enosh; neither are they plagued like adam.
Tehillim,73,6,Therefore ga'avah encircleth them like a chain necklace; chamas enwraps them like a garment.
Tehillim,73,7,Their eyes bulge with chelev; they have more than levav could imagine.
Tehillim,73,8,"They mock, and speak wickedly concerning oshek (oppression) ; they speak from marom (on high)."
Tehillim,73,9,"They set their mouth against Shomayim, and their leshon stalketh in ha'aretz."
Tehillim,73,10,Therefore their people return here; and mayim to the full are swallowed down by them.
Tehillim,73,11,"And they say, How doth El (G-d) know? And is there knowledge in Elyon?"
Tehillim,73,12,"Hinei, these are the resha'im; at ease olam, they increase in riches."
Tehillim,73,13,"Surely in vain have I cleansed my lev, and washed my hands in innocency."
Tehillim,73,14,"For kol hayom have I been plagued, and chastened in the bekarim (mornings)."
Tehillim,73,15,"If I say, I will speak thus; hinei, I would have dealt faithlessly with the dor banecha (the generation of Thy children)."
Tehillim,73,16,"When I thought to comprehend this, it was amal (difficulty) in my eyes;"
Tehillim,73,17,Until I went into the Mikdeshei El; then I had binah (understanding) of their (the wickedʼs) destiny.
Tehillim,73,18,"Surely Thou didst set them in slippery places; Thou castedst them down into mashu'ot (ruins, destruction)."
Tehillim,73,19,"How are they brought into desolation, as in a rega (moment) ! They are utterly consumed with balahot (terrors)."
Tehillim,73,20,"As a chalom when one awaketh; so, Adonoi, when Thou art aroused, Thou shalt despise their tzelem (shadowy form)."
Tehillim,73,21,"Thus my levav was grieved, and I was pricked in my mind."
Tehillim,73,22,"So senseless was I, and ignorant; I was like behemot before Thee."
Tehillim,73,23,Nevertheless I am with Thee tamid (always) ; Thou hast taken hold of me by my yamin.
Tehillim,73,24,"Thou shalt guide me with Thy etzah (counsel) , and afterward take me to kavod (glory)."
Tehillim,73,25,Whom have I in Shomayim but Thee? And there is none upon HaAretz that I desire beside Thee.
Tehillim,73,26,"My flesh and my levav may fail; but Elohim is the Tzur of my levav, and my chelek l'olam."
Tehillim,73,27,"For, hinei, they that are far from Thee shall perish; Thou hast destroyed all them that go zoneh (a-whoring) from Thee."
Tehillim,73,28,"But kiravat Elohim (drawing near to Elohim) is tov for me; I make in Adonoi Hashem my refuge, that I may declare all Thy deeds."
Tehillim,74,1,"O Elohim, why hast Thou cast us off lanetzach? Why doth Thine anger smoke against the tzon (sheep) of Thy mireh (pasture)?"
Tehillim,74,2,"Remember Thy Edah (congregation) , which Thou hast purchased of old; the shevet (tribe) of Thine nachalah, which Thou hast redeemed: this Har Tziyon, wherein Thou hast dwelt."
Tehillim,74,3,Lift up Thy footsteps unto the mashu'ot netzach (perpetual ruins) ; even all that the oyev hath done wickedly in the Kodesh.
Tehillim,74,4,Thine enemies roar in the midst of Thy Mo'ed (place of meeting) ; they set up their banners for otot (signs).
Tehillim,74,5,It had been as though one lifted up kardumim (axes) upon the thicket of etz.
Tehillim,74,6,But now they break down the carved panels at once with hammers and chisels.
Tehillim,74,7,"They have set ablaze Thy Mikdash, burning it to the ground; they have brought chillul to the Mishkan Shemecha (the dwelling place of Thy Name)."
Tehillim,74,8,"They said in their hearts, Let us crush them altogether; they have burned up all the Mo'adei El in HaAretz."
Tehillim,74,9,We see not our otot (signs) ; there is no longer any navi; neither is there among us any that knoweth ad mah (until when).
Tehillim,74,10,"O Elohim ad mosai, (how long) shall the adversary revile? Shall the oyev (enemy) blaspheme Thy Shem lanetzach (forever)?"
Tehillim,74,11,"Why withdrawest Thou Thy Yad, even Thy Yamin (Right Hand) ? Take it out of Thy Kheyk (bosom) and destroy."
Tehillim,74,12,"For Elohim is my Melech mikedem (from of old) , working Yeshu'ah (salvation) in the midst of Ha'Aretz."
Tehillim,74,13,Thou didst divide the yam by Thy oz (power) ; Thou didst break the heads of the sea serpents in the waters.
Tehillim,74,14,"Thou didst break the head of Leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to be ma'akhal (food) to the people inhabiting the wilderness."
Tehillim,74,15,Thou didst break open the fountain and the flood; Thou driedst up mighty naharot (rivers).
Tehillim,74,16,"The yom is Thine, the lailah also is Thine; Thou hast prepared the ma'ohr (luminary, moon) and the shemesh."
Tehillim,74,17,Thou hast set all the boundaries of Eretz; Thou hast made kayitz (summer) and choref (winter).
Tehillim,74,18,"Remember this, that the oyev (enemy) hath reproached Hashem , and that the am naval (foolish people) have blasphemed Shimcha."
Tehillim,74,19,O deliver not the nefesh of Thy turtledove unto the wild beast; forget not the life of Thy aniyim (poor) lanetzach (forever).
Tehillim,74,20,Have regard unto the Brit (covenant) ; for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of chamas.
Tehillim,74,21,O let not the oppressed return in shame; let the oni and evyon praise Thy Shem.
Tehillim,74,22,"Arise, O Elohim, fight for Thine Own cause; remember how the naval (foolish man) revileth Thee kol hayom."
Tehillim,74,23,"Forget not the kol (voice) of Thine enemies, the tumult of those against Thee that rises up tamid (continually)."
Tehillim,75,1,"Hodinu l'cha Elohim (Unto thee, Elohim, do we give thanks) . Hodinu; that Thy Shem is near Thy wondrous works declare."
Tehillim,75,2,"I shall seize the mo'ed (appointed time), I will judge uprightly."
Tehillim,75,3,"Eretz and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolving; I, even I, hold up the ammudim (pillars) of it. Selah"
Tehillim,75,4,"I said unto the hollelim (arrogant) , Deal not boastfully; and to the resha'im, Lift not up the keren;"
Tehillim,75,5,Lift not up your keren on high; speak not with a stiff neck.
Tehillim,75,6,"For promotion cometh lo (not) from the east, nor from the west, nor from the desert."
Tehillim,75,7,"But Elohim is the Shofet; He bringeth down one, and setteth up another."
Tehillim,75,8,"For in the yad Hashem there is a kos, and the yayin is foaming; full of mixture; and He poureth out of the same; but the dregs thereof, all rishei aretz (wicked of the earth) shall drain them down, and drink them."
Tehillim,75,9,But I will proclaim l'olam; I will sing zemirot to Elohei Ya'akov.
Tehillim,75,10,All the karnayim of the resha'im also will I cut off; but the karnayim of the tzaddik shall be exalted.
Tehillim,76,1,In Yehudah is Elohim known; Shmo is gadol in Yisroel.
Tehillim,76,2,"In Shalem also is His Sukkah, and His Ma'on (dwelling place) in Tziyon."
Tehillim,76,3,"There He broke the flashing arrows, the mogen, and the cherev, and the milchamah. Selah"
Tehillim,76,4,Thou art more glorious and adir (majestic) than the mountains of prey.
Tehillim,76,5,The stouthearted are plundered; now their last sleep they sleep; and none of the anshei chayil can find their hands.
Tehillim,76,6,"At Thy rebuke, O Elohei Ya'akov, both the merkavah and sus are cast into a dead sleep."
Tehillim,76,7,"Thou, even Thou, art to be feared; and who may stand in Thy sight when once Thou art angry?"
Tehillim,76,8,"Thou didst pronounce din (sentence, judgment) from Shomayim; Eretz feared, and was still,"
Tehillim,76,9,"When Elohim arose to mishpat, to save all the meek of Eretz. Selah"
Tehillim,76,10,"Surely the chamat adam (the wrath of man) shall praise Thee; the she'erit (remnant, survivor) of wrath shalt Thou restrain."
Tehillim,76,11,"Make neder (vow) , and pay unto Hashem Eloheichem; let all that be around Him bring gifts unto Him that ought to be feared."
Tehillim,76,12,He shall cut short the ruach of negidim (nobles) ; He is fearsome to the Malkhei-Aretz (Kings of the Earth).
Tehillim,77,1,"I cried unto Elohim with my voice, even unto Elohim with my voice; and He gave ear unto me."
Tehillim,77,2,"In my yom tzoros (day of trouble) I sought Adonoi; my hand was stretched up in the lailah, and ceased not; my nefesh refused to be comforted."
Tehillim,77,3,"I remembered Elohim, and groaned; I pondered, and my ruach was overwhelmed. Selah"
Tehillim,77,4,Thou holdest mine eyelids awake; I am so troubled that lo adaber (I cannot speak).
Tehillim,77,5,"I have considered the yamim mikedem (days of old) , the shnot olamim (years long past)."
Tehillim,77,6,I called to remembrance my neginah balailah (song in the night) ; I communed with mine own lev; and my ruach pondered with diligent search.
Tehillim,77,7,Will Adonoi cast off forever? And will He show favor no more?
Tehillim,77,8,Is His chesed passed away forever? Is His promise at an end l'dor vador?
Tehillim,77,9,Hath El (G-d) forgotten to be channot (gracious) ? Hath He in anger shut up His rachamim (mercy) ? Selah
Tehillim,77,10,"And I said, This is my affliction; but I will remember the shanot of the Yemin Elyon (Right Hand of the Most High)."
Tehillim,77,11,"I will remember the deeds of Hashem ; surely I will remember Thy wonders mikedem (of old, of long ago)."
Tehillim,77,12,"I will meditate also on kol po'al (all work) of Thine, and consider Thy mighty deeds."
Tehillim,77,13,"Thy Derech, O Elohim, is bakodesh (in holiness) . Who is so gadol El as Elohim?"
Tehillim,77,14,"Thou art HaEl oseh peleh (the G-d that doest wonders) ; Thou hast declared Thy oz (strength) among the amim (peoples, nations)."
Tehillim,77,15,"Thou hast with Thine zero'a (strong arm) redeemed Thy people, the Bnei Ya'akov and Yosef. Selah"
Tehillim,77,16,"The mayim saw Thee, O Elohim, the mayim saw Thee; they were afraid; the tehomot (ocean depths) also writhed."
Tehillim,77,17,The clouds poured down mayim; the skies resounded in thunder; Thine khitzim (arrows) also went forth.
Tehillim,77,18,The voice of Thy thunder was in the galgal (whirlwind) ; the lightning lit up the tevel (world) ; ha'aretz trembled and quaked.
Tehillim,77,19,"Thy derech is in the yam (sea) , and Thy path is through the mayim rabbim (great waters) , and Thy footsteps are not to be discerned."
Tehillim,77,20,Thou didst lead Thy people like a tzon (flock) by the yad Moshe and Aharon.
Tehillim,78,1,"Give ear, O my people, to my torah; incline your ears to the words of my mouth."
Tehillim,78,2,"I will open my mouth in a mashal; I will utter dark sayings from of old,"
Tehillim,78,3,"Which we have heard and known, and Avoteinu have told us."
Tehillim,78,4,"We will not hide them from their banim, recounting to the dor acharon the tehillot Hashem , and His power, and His nifla'ot (wonderful works) that He hath done."
Tehillim,78,5,"For He established edut in Ya'akov, set torah in Yisroel, which He commanded Avoteinu, that they should make them known to their banim;"
Tehillim,78,6,"So that the dor acharon might know them, even the banim which should be born; who should arise and recount them to their banim;"
Tehillim,78,7,"That they might put their confidence in Elohim, and not forget the ma'allei El (works of G-d) , but keep His mitzvot;"
Tehillim,78,8,"And might not be as their Avot, a dor sorer u'moreh (stubborn and rebellious generation) ; a generation that set not its lev aright, and whose ruach was not faithful to G-d."
Tehillim,78,9,"The Bnei Ephrayim, being armed, and shooting keshet (the bows) , turned back in the day of battle."
Tehillim,78,10,"They kept not the Brit Elohim, and refused to walk in His torah;"
Tehillim,78,11,"And forgot His works, and His nifla'ot (wonders) that He had shown them."
Tehillim,78,12,"Peleh (marvellous things) did He in the sight of their avot, in Eretz Mitzrayim, in the sadeh (area) of Tzoan."
Tehillim,78,13,"He divided the yam, and caused them to pass through; and He made the mayim to stand like a heap."
Tehillim,78,14,"In the daytime also He led them with an anan, and all the lailah with an ohr of eish."
Tehillim,78,15,"He split the rocks in the midbar, and gave them drink as out of the great tehomot."
Tehillim,78,16,"He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused mayim to run down like rivers."
Tehillim,78,17,And they sinned yet more against Him by provoking Elyon in the wilderness.
Tehillim,78,18,And they tested G-d by their lev by demanding ochel for their lust.
Tehillim,78,19,"And they spoke against Elohim; they said, Can G-d spread a shulchan in the midbar?"
Tehillim,78,20,"Behold, He struck the Tzur, that the mayim gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can He give lechem also? Can He provide meat for His people?"
Tehillim,78,21,"Therefore Hashem heard this, and was in wrath; so an eish was kindled against Ya'akov, and anger also came up against Yisroel;"
Tehillim,78,22,"Because they believed not in Elohim, and trusted not in His Yeshu'ah (salvation);"
Tehillim,78,23,"Though He had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the daletei Shomayim (doors of heaven),"
Tehillim,78,24,"And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the bread of Shomayim."
Tehillim,78,25,Ish did eat the bread of angels; He sent them lechem to the full.
Tehillim,78,26,He caused an east wind to blow from Shomayim; and by His oz He brought in the south wind.
Tehillim,78,27,"He rained meat also upon them like aphar, and winged fowls like the chol (sand) of the sea;"
Tehillim,78,28,"And He let it fall in the midst of their machaneh, all around their mishkenot (habitations)."
Tehillim,78,29,"So they did eat, and were well filled; for He gave them their own ta'avah (evil desire)."
Tehillim,78,30,"They were not estranged from their ta'avah. But while their food was yet in their mouths,"
Tehillim,78,31,"The Af Elohim (wrath of G-d) came upon them, and slaughtered the stoutest of them, and cut down the bochurim of Yisroel."
Tehillim,78,32,"For all this they sinned still, and believed not in His nifla'ot (wondrous works)."
Tehillim,78,33,"Therefore their yamim did He consume in hevel (futility, vanity) and their shanim in terror."
Tehillim,78,34,"When He slaughtered them, then they sought Him; and they returned and inquired diligently after G-d."
Tehillim,78,35,"And they remembered that Elohim was their Tzur, and the El Elyon their Go'el (Redeemer)."
Tehillim,78,36,"Nevertheless they did flatter Him with their mouth, and they lied unto Him with their leshon."
Tehillim,78,37,"For their lev was not right with Him, neither were they faithful in His Brit."
Tehillim,78,38,"But He, being full of compassion, made kapporah for their avon and destroyed them not; and He many times turned His anger away, and did not stir up all His wrath."
Tehillim,78,39,"For He remembered that they were but basar; a ruach (wind) that passeth away, and cometh not again."
Tehillim,78,40,"How oft did they provoke Him in the midbar, and grieve Him in the desert!"
Tehillim,78,41,"Again and again they turned back and tested G-d, and imposed limits on Kadosh Yisroel."
Tehillim,78,42,"They remembered not His Yad (Hand, Power) , nor the yom (day) when He redeemed them from the enemy."
Tehillim,78,43,"How He had wrought His otot in Mitzrayim, and His mofetim in the area of Tzoan."
Tehillim,78,44,"And had turned their rivers into dahm; and their streams, that they could not drink."
Tehillim,78,45,"He sent swarms of flies among them, which devoured them; and tzfarde'a (frogs) , which destroyed them."
Tehillim,78,46,"He gave also their crop unto the grasshopper, and their produce unto the arbeh (locust)."
Tehillim,78,47,"He destroyed their gefen with barad (hail) , and their fig trees with frost."
Tehillim,78,48,"He gave up their cattle also to the barad (hail) , and their livestock herds to hot thunderbolts."
Tehillim,78,49,"He cast upon them His charon af, evrah (wrath) , and za'am (indignation) , and tzarah, by sending malachim ra'im among them."
Tehillim,78,50,"He made a way for His anger; He spared not their nefesh from mavet (death) , but gave their beasts over to the dever (plague);"
Tehillim,78,51,And struck all the bechor in Mitzrayim; the reshit (first fruit) of their strength in the ohalim of Cham;
Tehillim,78,52,"But made His own people to go forth like tzon, and guided them in the midbar like an eder (flock)."
Tehillim,78,53,"And He led them in safety, so that they had no terror; but the yam overwhelmed their oyevim."
Tehillim,78,54,"And He brought them to His gevul kadosh (His holy border) , even to this Har, which His Yamin had purchased."
Tehillim,78,55,"He cast out the Goyim also before them, and divided by measure a nachalah for them, and made the Shivtei Yisroel to dwell in their ohalim."
Tehillim,78,56,"Yet they tested and provoked Elohim Elyon, and were not shomer over His edot;"
Tehillim,78,57,"But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their avot; they turned like a treacherous keshet."
Tehillim,78,58,"For they provoked Him to anger with their high places, and moved Him to jealousy with their pesilim."
Tehillim,78,59,"When Elohim heard this, He was in wrath, and greatly abhorred Yisroel;"
Tehillim,78,60,"So that He forsook the Mishkan of Shiloh, the Ohel which He placed among adam (men);"
Tehillim,78,61,"And delivered His oz (strength) into captivity, and His tiferet into the hand of the enemy."
Tehillim,78,62,He gave His people over also unto the cherev; and was in wrath with His nachalah.
Tehillim,78,63,The eish consumed their bochurim; and their betulot had no wedding celebration.
Tehillim,78,64,Their kohanim fell by the cherev; and their almanot made no lamentation.
Tehillim,78,65,"Then Adonoi awaked as one from sleep, and like a gibbor that shouteth from yayin."
Tehillim,78,66,And He struck down His enemies behind; He put them to cherpat olam (perpetual reproach).
Tehillim,78,67,"Moreover He rejected the Ohel Yosef, and chose not the Shevet Ephrayim;"
Tehillim,78,68,"But chose the Shevet Yehudah, Har Tziyon which He loved."
Tehillim,78,69,"And He built His Mikdash like heavenly heights, like Eretz which He hath established l'olam."
Tehillim,78,70,"He chose Dovid also His Eved, and took him from the mikhle'ot tzon (sheepfolds);"
Tehillim,78,71,"From following the nursing ewes He brought him to shepherd Ya'akov His people, and Yisroel His nachalah."
Tehillim,78,72,"So he shepherded them according to the tohm (integrity, guilelessness) of his lev; and led them by the skillfulness of his hands."
Tehillim,79,1,"O Elohim, the Goyim are come into Thine Nachalah; Thy Heikhal Kodesh have they defiled; they have reduced Yerushalayim to rubble."
Tehillim,79,2,"The dead bodies of Thy avadim have they given to be food unto the oph HaShomayim, the basar of Thy Chasidim, unto the beasts of the earth."
Tehillim,79,3,Their shefach dahm (shedding of blood) is like mayim all around Yerushalayim; and there is none to bury them.
Tehillim,79,4,"We are become a reproach to our shekhenim (neighbors) , a scorn and derision to them that are around us."
Tehillim,79,5,"How long, Hashem ? Wilt Thou be angry lanetzach (forever) ? Shall Thy kina (jealousy) burn like eish?"
Tehillim,79,6,"Pour out Thy wrath upon the Goyim that have no da'as of Thee, and upon the mamlachot that have not called upon Thy Shem."
Tehillim,79,7,"For they have devoured Ya'akov, and laid waste his naveh (home)."
Tehillim,79,8,O remember not against us avonot rishonim (former iniquities) ; let Thy rachamim speedily come to us; for we are brought very low.
Tehillim,79,9,"Help us, O Elohei Yisheinu, (G-d of our salvation) , for the kavod of Thy Shem; and deliver us, and make kapporah for our sins, for Thy Nameʼs sake."
Tehillim,79,10,"Why should the Goyim say, Where is Eloheihem? Let there be known among the Goyim in our sight, vengeance for the shefach dahm of Thy avadim."
Tehillim,79,11,Let the groaning of the asir (prisoner) come before Thee; according to the greatness of Thy Zero'a preserve Thou those that are Bnei Temutah (sons of death);
Tehillim,79,12,"And repay unto our shekhenim (neighbors) sevenfold into their kheyk their reproach, wherewith they have reproached Thee, Adonoi."
Tehillim,79,13,So we Thy people and tzon of Thy pasture will give Thee thanks l'olam (forever) ; we will show forth Thy praise l'dor vador.
Tehillim,80,1,"Give ear, O Ro'eh Yisroel, Thou that leadest Yosef like a tzon; Thou that art enthroned between the Keruvim, shine forth."
Tehillim,80,2,"Before Ephrayim and Binyamin and Menasheh, Stir up Thy gevurah (might) , and come and save us."
Tehillim,80,3,"Turn us again, O Elohim, and cause Thy face to shine that we may be saved."
Tehillim,80,4," Hashem Elohim Tzva'os, ad mosai (how long) wilt Thou be angry against the tefillat amecha (prayer of Thy people)?"
Tehillim,80,5,Thou feedest them with the lechem dimah (bread of tears) ; and givest them dima'ot (tears) to drink in great measure.
Tehillim,80,6,"Thou makest us a madon (strife, contention) unto shcheneinu (our neighbors) , and oyveinu (our enemies) mock us."
Tehillim,80,7,"Turn us again, O Elohim Tzva'os, and cause Thy face to shine that we may be saved."
Tehillim,80,8,"Thou hast brought a gefen (vine) out of Mitzrayim; Thou hast drove out Goyim, and planted it."
Tehillim,80,9,"Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the eretz."
Tehillim,80,10,"The harim were covered with the tzel (shadow) of it, and the branches thereof were like the mighty cedars."
Tehillim,80,11,"It sent out its branches unto the yam (sea), and its shoots unto the Nahar (river)."
Tehillim,80,12,"Lammah (why) hast Thou then broken down her walls, so that all they which pass by the derech do pluck her?"
Tehillim,80,13,"The chazir (wild boar) out of the forest doth lay it waste, and the beasts of the sadeh doth devour it."
Tehillim,80,14,"Shuv nah (return now) , we beseech Thee, O Elohim Tzva'os; look down from Shomayim, and behold, and visit gefen zot (this vine);"
Tehillim,80,15,"And the stock which Thy Yamin (Right Hand) hath planted, and the Ben that Thou madest strong for Thyself."
Tehillim,80,16,"It is burned with eish, it is cut down; they perish at the ge'arah (rebuke) of Thy countenance."
Tehillim,80,17,"Let Thy Yad be upon the Ish Yeminecha (the Man of your Right Hand) , upon the Ben Adam whom Thou madest strong for Thyself."
Tehillim,80,18,"So will we never turn back from Thee; revive us, and we will call upon Thy Shem."
Tehillim,80,19,"Turn us again, Hashem Elohim Tzva'os; cause Thy face to shine that we may be saved."
Tehillim,81,1,Sing with joy unto Elohim uzeinu (our strength) ; make a joyful noise unto Elohei Ya'akov.
Tehillim,81,2,"Begin a song, and bring hither the tambourine, the pleasant kinnor (harp) with the nevel (lyre)."
Tehillim,81,3,"Blow the shofar at Rosh Chodesh, at the full moon, on Yom Chageinu."
Tehillim,81,4,"For this was a chok for Yisroel, and a mishpat of the Elohei Ya'akov."
Tehillim,81,5,"This He ordained in Yosef for an edut, when He went out over Eretz Mitzrayim; where a language of one not known did I hear."
Tehillim,81,6,I removed his shekhem (shoulder) from the burden; his hands were delivered from the basket.
Tehillim,81,7,"In tzoros thou calledst, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the seter ra'am (secret place of thunder) ; I tested thee at the waters of Merivah. Selah"
Tehillim,81,8,"Shema, O My people, and I will admonish thee; O Yisroel, if thou wilt pay heed unto Me;"
Tehillim,81,9,"There shall no el zar (strange, foreign g-d) be among thee; neither shalt thou worship any el nechar (foreign g-d)."
Tehillim,81,10,"I am Hashem Eloheicha Who brought thee out of Eretz Mitzrayim; open thy mouth wide, I will fill it."
Tehillim,81,11,But My people would not pay heed to My voice; and Yisroel would have none of Me.
Tehillim,81,12,So I gave them up unto their own heartsʼ sherirut (stubbornness) ; and they walked in their own mo'atzot (counsels).
Tehillim,81,13,"Oh that My people had paid heed unto Me, and Yisroel had walked in My ways!"
Tehillim,81,14,"I should soon have subdued their oyevim and turned My Yad (hand, power) against their adversaries."
Tehillim,81,15,"The haters of Hashem should have cringed before Him; their et (time, fate, punishment) endures l'olam."
Tehillim,81,16,He would have fed them also with the finest of the chittah (wheat) ; and with devash (honey) from the Tzur would I have satisfied thee.
Tehillim,82,1,Elohim standeth in the Adat El; He judgeth among the elohim.
Tehillim,82,2,"Ad mosai (How long) will ye judge unjustly, and show partiality to the resha'im? Selah"
Tehillim,82,3,Defend the poor and yatom (fatherless) ; do justice to the oni (afflicted) and needy.
Tehillim,82,4,Deliver the poor and needy; rid them out of the yad resha'im.
Tehillim,82,5,"They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in choshech; all the foundations of ha'aretz are shaken."
Tehillim,82,6,"I have said, elohim ye are; and all of you are Bnei HaElyon."
Tehillim,82,7,"But ye shall die like adam, and fall like one of the sarim (princes)."
Tehillim,82,8,"Arise, Elohim, judge ha'aretz; for Thou shalt inherit kol HaGoyim."
Tehillim,83,1,"Keep not Thou silent, O Elohim; hold not Thy peace, and be not still, O El (G-d)."
Tehillim,83,2,"For, hinei, Thine oyevim are in tumult; and they that hate Thee have lifted up the rosh."
Tehillim,83,3,"They lay out a crafty conspiracy against Amecha (Thy people) , and plot against Tzefunecha (Thy sheltered, protected, hidden ones)."
Tehillim,83,4,"They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a goy (nation) ; that the shem Yisroel may be no more remembered."
Tehillim,83,5,For they have plotted together with one lev; they cut a brit against Thee;
Tehillim,83,6,"The ohalim Edom, and the Yishm'elim; of Moav, and the Hagerim;"
Tehillim,83,7,"Geval, and Ammon, and Amalek; Peleshet (Philistia) with the inhabitants of Tzor;"
Tehillim,83,8,Assyria also is joined with them; they are the zero'a (strong arm) of the Bnei Lot. Selah
Tehillim,83,9,"Do unto them as unto Midyan; as to Sisra, as to Yavin, at the Wadi Kishon;"
Tehillim,83,10,"Which became shmad at Ein-Dor; they became like domen (dung, fertilizer) for ha'adamah."
Tehillim,83,11,"Make their nobles like Orev, and like Ze'ev; yes, all their princes like Zevach, and like Tzalmunna;"
Tehillim,83,12,"Who said, Let us take possession for ourselves of the pasturelands of Elohim."
Tehillim,83,13,"O Elohai, make them like galgal (tumbleweed) ; like chaff before the ruach (wind)."
Tehillim,83,14,"As the eish consumeth the forest, and as the flame setteth ablaze harim;"
Tehillim,83,15,"So pursue them with Thy sa'ar (tempest, storm) , and make them afraid with Thy storm."
Tehillim,83,16,"Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek Shimcha, Hashem."
Tehillim,83,17,"Let them be put to shame and dismayed adei ad (forever) ; yes, let them perish in disgrace;"
Tehillim,83,18,"Let them have da'as that Thou alone, Shimcha Hashem , art Elyon al kol HaAretz."
Tehillim,84,1,"How yedidot (lovely) are thy mishkanot, O Hashem Tzva'os!"
Tehillim,84,2,"My nefesh longeth, yea, even fainteth for the khatzrot Hashem (courts of Hashem) ; my lev and my basar crieth out for El Chai."
Tehillim,84,3,"Yea, the sparrow hath found a bais, and the swallow a ken (nest) for herself, where she may lay her young, even Thine mizbechot, O Hashem Tzva'os Malki v'Elohai."
Tehillim,84,4,Ashrei are they that dwell in Thy Beis; they are ever praising Thee. Selah
Tehillim,84,5,Ashrei is the adam whose oz (strength) is in Thee; in whose lev are their highways [to Tziyon].
Tehillim,84,6,"Who passing through the valley of Baca (weeping) make it a ma'ayon (spring, fountain) ; the moreh (early rain) also covereth it with berakhot (blessings)."
Tehillim,84,7,"They go from strength to strength, every one of them who appeareth before Elohim in Tziyon."
Tehillim,84,8,"O Hashem Elohim Tzva'os, hear my tefillah; give ear, O Elohei Ya'akov. Selah"
Tehillim,84,9,"Behold mogineinu (our shield) , O Elohim, and look upon the face of Thine Moshiach."
Tehillim,84,10,"For a yom in Thy khatzrot is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the Beis Elohai, than to dwell in the ohalim resha (tents of wickedness)."
Tehillim,84,11,For Hashem Elohim is a shemesh and a mogen; Hashem will give chen and kavod; no good thing will He withhold from the holekhim b'tamim (them that walk uprightly).
Tehillim,84,12,"O Hashem Tzva'os, ashrei is the adam bote'ach (man that trusteth, hath confident faith) in Thee."
Tehillim,85,1," Hashem , Thou hast been favorable unto Thy land; Thou hast brought back the captivity of Ya'akov."
Tehillim,85,2,Thou hast forgiven the avon (iniquity) of Amecha (Thy people) ; Thou hast covered all their chattat (sin) . Selah
Tehillim,85,3,Thou hast withdrawn all Thy wrath; Thou hast turned from Thine charon af.
Tehillim,85,4,"Turn us, O Elohei Yisheinu (G-d of our salvation) , and put away Thine ka'as (anger) toward us."
Tehillim,85,5,Wilt Thou be angry with us l'olam? Wilt Thou draw out Thine anger l'dor vador?
Tehillim,85,6,Wilt Thou not revive us again; that Amecha (Thy people) may rejoice in Thee?
Tehillim,85,7,"Show us chasdecha (Thy chesed, kindness, steadfast love), Hashem , and grant us Thy salvation."
Tehillim,85,8,"I will hear what HaEl Hashem will say; for He will speak shalom unto His people, and to His Chasidim; but let them not turn again to folly."
Tehillim,85,9,Surely His salvation is karov (near) them that fear Him; that kavod may dwell in Artzeinu (our land).
Tehillim,85,10,Chesed and emes will meet together; tzedek and shalom will kiss each other.
Tehillim,85,11,Emes shall titzmach (sprout forth) out of ha'aretz; and tzedek shall look down from Shomayim.
Tehillim,85,12,"Yes, Hashem shall give that which is tov; and Artzeinu (our land) shall yield her yevul (increase, produce)."
Tehillim,85,13,Tzedek shall go before Him; and shall set us in the Derech of His steps.
Tehillim,86,1,"Incline Thine ear, Hashem ; hear me; for I am ani (poor) and evyon (needy)."
Tehillim,86,2,"Be shomer over my nefesh; for I am chasid; O Thou Elohai, save Thy eved that trusteth in Thee."
Tehillim,86,3,"Channeni (be merciful) unto me, Adonoi; for I cry unto Thee kol hayom."
Tehillim,86,4,"Samei'ach (rejoice) the nefesh of Thy eved; for unto Thee, Adonoi, do I lift up my nefesh."
Tehillim,86,5,"For Thou, Adonoi, art tov, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in chesed unto all them that call upon Thee."
Tehillim,86,6,"Give ear, Hashem , unto my tefillah (prayer) ; and attend to the voice of my techinnot (supplications)."
Tehillim,86,7,In my yom tzoros I will call upon Thee; for Thou wilt answer me.
Tehillim,86,8,"Ein kamocha vaelohim (there is none like Thee among the g-ds) , Adonoi; nor are there any ma'asim like Thine."
Tehillim,86,9,"Kol Goyim whom Thou hast made shall come and worship before Thee, Adonoi; and shall glorify Shimcha."
Tehillim,86,10,"For Thou art gadol, and doest nifla'ot (wondrous things) ; Thou alone art Elohim."
Tehillim,86,11,"Teach me Thy Derech, Hashem ; I will walk in Thy emes; Yachad (make undivided) levavi (my heart) to fear Thy Shem."
Tehillim,86,12,"I will praise Thee, Adonoi Elohai, with all my lev; and I will glorify Shimecha l'olam."
Tehillim,86,13,For gadol is Thy chesed toward me; and Thou hast saved my nefesh from the lowermost Sheol.
Tehillim,86,14,"O Elohim, the zedim (arrogant ones, proud, insolent ones) are risen up against me, and the adat aritzim (band of violent men) seek my nefesh; and have not set Thee before them."
Tehillim,86,15,"But Thou, Adonoi, art El Rachum and Channun, slow to anger, and plenteous in chesed and emes."
Tehillim,86,16,"O turn unto me, and be gracious upon me; give Thy oz (strength) unto Thy eved, and save the ben amatecha (the son of Thy handmaid)."
Tehillim,86,17,"Show me an ot (sign) for tovah; that they which hate me may see it, and be put to shame; because Thou, Hashem , hast helped me, and comforted me."
Tehillim,87,1,On the Harei Kodesh (Holy Mountain) stands His foundation.
Tehillim,87,2, Hashem loveth the sha'arei Tziyon more than all the mishkenot Ya'akov.
Tehillim,87,3,"Glorious things are spoken of thee, O Ir HaElohim. Selah"
Tehillim,87,4,"To them that know me, I will make mention of Rachav and Babylon; hinei, Philistia, and Tzor, with Ethiopia: this man was born there."
Tehillim,87,5,"But of Tziyon it shall be said, This one and that one were born in her; and Elyon Himself shall establish it."
Tehillim,87,6," Hashem shall register, when He writeth up the people, that this one was born there. Selah"
Tehillim,87,7,The sharim (ones singing) as well as the cholelim (players on instruments) shall be there; all my fountains are in thee.
Tehillim,88,1," Hashem Elohei Yeshu'ati (G-d of my salvation) , I have cried out yom valailah before Thee."
Tehillim,88,2,Let my tefillah come before Thee; incline Thine ear unto my cry;
Tehillim,88,3,For my nefesh is full of troubles; and my life draweth near unto Sheol.
Tehillim,88,4,I am counted with them that go down into the bor (pit) ; I am like a gever (man) that hath no strength;
Tehillim,88,5,"Free among the mesim, like the slain that lie in the kever, whom Thou rememberest no more; and nigzaru (they are cut off, excluded) from Thy Yad (hand, power, care)."
Tehillim,88,6,"Thou hast laid me in the lowest bor (pit) , in darkness, in the deeps."
Tehillim,88,7,"Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and Thou hast overwhelmed me with kol mishbarecha (all Thy waves, breakers) . Selah"
Tehillim,88,8,"Thou hast estranged mine acquaintances far from me; Thou hast made me to'evot unto them; I am shut up, and I cannot escape."
Tehillim,88,9,"Mine eye groweth dim by reason of oni (affliction); Hashem , I have called daily upon Thee, I have stretched up my hands unto Thee."
Tehillim,88,10,Wilt Thou show wonders to the mesim? Shall the lifeless arise and praise Thee? Selah
Tehillim,88,11,Shall Thy chesed be declared in the kever? Or Thy emunah in Avaddon?
Tehillim,88,12,"Shall Thy wonders be known in the choshech? And Thy tzedakah in the Eretz Neshiyyah (land of forgetfulness, oblivion)?"
Tehillim,88,13,"But unto Thee have I cried, Hashem ; and in the boker shall my tefillah come before Thee."
Tehillim,88,14," Hashem , why castest Thou off my nefesh? Why hidest Thou Thy face from me?"
Tehillim,88,15,I am afflicted and govei'a (one being close to death) from my youth up; while I suffer Thy terrors I am distraught.
Tehillim,88,16,Thy charon (fierce wrath) goeth over me; Thy terrors have flayed me.
Tehillim,88,17,"They came round about me daily like mayim; they close in, engulfing me."
Tehillim,88,18,"Ohev (lover) and re'a (companion) hast Thou estranged from me, and mine acquaintances are in darkness."
Tehillim,89,1,I will sing of the mercies of Hashem olam; with my mouth will I make known Thy emunah (faithfulness) to dor vador.
Tehillim,89,2,"For I have said, Chesed shall be built up olam; Thy emunah (faithfulness) shalt Thou establish in Shomayim itself."
Tehillim,89,3,"I have made a Brit with My Bechir (Chosen one) , I have sworn unto Dovid Avdi,"
Tehillim,89,4,"Thy Zera will I establish ad olam, and build up thy kisse to dor vador. Selah"
Tehillim,89,5,"And Shomayim shall praise Thy wonders, O Hashem ; Thy emunah (faithfulness) also in the Kahal Kedoshim."
Tehillim,89,6,For who in the heavens can be compared unto Hashem ? Who among the bnei elim can be likened unto Hashem?
Tehillim,89,7,"G-d is greatly to be feared in the sod Kedoshim (council of the holy ones) , and is awesome over all them that are around Him."
Tehillim,89,8," Hashem Elohei Tzva'os, who is like Thee, O Mighty One, Hashem ? Thy emunah also surrounds Thee!"
Tehillim,89,9,"Thou rulest the raging of the yam; when the waves thereof arise, Thou stillest them."
Tehillim,89,10,"Thou hast broken Rachav in pieces, as one that is slain; Thou hast scattered Thine oyevim with Thy strong Zero'a."
Tehillim,89,11,"Shomayim are Thine, Eretz also is Thine; as for the tevel (world) and the fulness thereof, Thou hast founded them."
Tehillim,89,12,The tzafon (north) and the yamin (south) Thou hast created them; Tavor and Chermon shall sing for joy in Thy Shem.
Tehillim,89,13,"Thou hast a mighty Zero'a; strong is Thy Yad, and exalted is Thy Yamin."
Tehillim,89,14,Tzedek and mishpat are the foundation of Thy kisse; chesed and emes shall go before Thy face.
Tehillim,89,15,"Ashrei is the people that know the joyful sound; they shall walk, Hashem , in the ohr (light) of Thy countenance."
Tehillim,89,16,In Thy Shem shall they rejoice kol hayom; and in Thy tzedakah shall they be exalted.
Tehillim,89,17,"For Thou art the tiferet (splendor, glory) of their strength; and in Thy favor our keren shall be exalted."
Tehillim,89,18,For Hashem is our mogen; and the Kadosh Yisroel is Malkeinu (our king).
Tehillim,89,19,"Then Thou spoke in chazon (vision) to Thy chasidim, and saidst, I have laid ezer (help) upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people."
Tehillim,89,20,I have found Dovid Avdi; with My shemen kadosh (holy oil) meshachtiv (I anointed him);
Tehillim,89,21,With whom My yad shall be established; Mine zero'a also shall strengthen him.
Tehillim,89,22,The oyev (enemy) shall not ensnare him; nor the ben avlah (son of wickedness) afflict him.
Tehillim,89,23,"And I will beat down his tzar before his face, and strike down them that hate him."
Tehillim,89,24,But My emunah (faithfulness) and My chesed shall be with him; and in My Shem shall his keren be exalted.
Tehillim,89,25,"I will set his yad also upon the yam, and his yamin upon the neharot (rivers)."
Tehillim,89,26,"He shall cry out unto Me, Thou art Avi, Eli, and the Tzur of my Yeshu'ah (salvation)."
Tehillim,89,27,"Also I will make him My Bechor, elyon (most exalted) of the Malkhei Aretz."
Tehillim,89,28,"My chesed will I be shomer over for him forevermore, and My Brit shall stand unfailing with him."
Tehillim,89,29,"His zera also will I make to endure forever, and his kisse as the days of Shomayim."
Tehillim,89,30,"If his banim forsake My torah, walk not in My mishpatim,"
Tehillim,89,31,"If they violate My chukkot, and are not shomer over My mitzvot;"
Tehillim,89,32,"Then will I visit their peysha with shevet (rod) , and their avon (iniquity) with stripes."
Tehillim,89,33,"Nevertheless My chesed will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer My emunah (faithfulness) to fail."
Tehillim,89,34,"My Brit will I not violate, nor alter the thing that is gone out of My lips."
Tehillim,89,35,Once have I sworn by My Kodesh; I will not lie unto Dovid.
Tehillim,89,36,"His zera shall endure l'olam, and his kisse as the shemesh before Me."
Tehillim,89,37,"It shall be established olam as the yarei'ach, and as an ed ne'eman (a faithful witness) in the heavens. Selah"
Tehillim,89,38,"But Thou hast cast off and abhorred, Thou hast been in wrath with Thine Moshiach."
Tehillim,89,39,Thou hast made void the Brit of Thy eved; Thou hast profaned his nezer (diadem) to the ground.
Tehillim,89,40,Thou hast broken down all his gederot (hedges) ; Thou hast brought his strongholds to ruin.
Tehillim,89,41,All that pass by the derech plunder him; he is a cherpah (reproach) to his shchenim.
Tehillim,89,42,Thou hast exalted the yamin of his adversaries; Thou hast made all his oyevim to rejoice.
Tehillim,89,43,"Thou hast also turned back the edge of his cherev, and hast not made him to stand in the milchamah."
Tehillim,89,44,"Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his kisse down to the ground."
Tehillim,89,45,The days of his youth hast thou shortened; Thou hast covered him with bushah (shame) . Selah
Tehillim,89,46,"How long, Hashem ? Wilt Thou hide Thyself lanetzach (forever) ? Shall Thy wrath burn like eish?"
Tehillim,89,47,Remember how short my time is. For what vanity hast Thou created kol bnei adam?
Tehillim,89,48,"What gever is he that liveth, and shall not see mavet? Shall he deliver his nefesh from the yad Sheol (power of Sheol) ? Selah"
Tehillim,89,49,"Adonoi, where are Thy former lovingkindnesses, which Thou didst swear unto Dovid in Thy emunah?"
Tehillim,89,50,"Remember, Adonoi, the reproach of Thy avadim; how I do bear in my kheyk (bosom) the reproach of all rabbim amim (many peoples);"
Tehillim,89,51,"Wherewith Thine oyevim have reproached, Hashem ; wherewith they have reproached the ikkevot (footsteps) of Thine Moshiach."
Tehillim,89,52,Baruch Hashem l'olam. Omein and Omein.
Tehillim,90,1,"Adonoi, Thou hast been our ma'on (dwelling place) b'dor vador."
Tehillim,90,2,"Before the harim were brought forth, or ever Thou hadst formed eretz and the tevel (inhabited world) , even from olam ad olam, Thou art El (G-d)."
Tehillim,90,3,"Thou turnest enosh to dakka (dust) ; and sayest, Shuvu, ye Bnei Adam."
Tehillim,90,4,"For an elef shanim in Thy sight are but as yom etmol (yesterday) when it is past, and as an ashmurah (watch, division of time) in the lailah."
Tehillim,90,5,Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sheinah (sleep) ; in the boker they are like khatzir (grass) which withereth.
Tehillim,90,6,"In the boker it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the erev it is cut down, and drieth up."
Tehillim,90,7,"For we are consumed by Thine anger, and by Thy chemah are we troubled."
Tehillim,90,8,"Thou hast set avonoteinu before Thee, our secret sins in the ohr of Thy countenance."
Tehillim,90,9,For kol yameinu are passed away in Thy evrah (fury) ; we spend shaneinu (our years) like a sigh.
Tehillim,90,10,"The yamim of shnoteinu (our years, life) are threescore shanah and ten; and if by reason of gevurot they are fourscore shanah, yet is their boast amal (trouble, toil) and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away."
Tehillim,90,11,"Who has da'as of the oz (power) of Thine anger? Thy evrah is as great as Thy yirah (fear of, reverence owed G-d)."
Tehillim,90,12,"So teach us to number yameinu, that we may apply levav unto chochmah."
Tehillim,90,13,"Shuvah, Hashem . Ad mosai? Have compassion on Thy avadim."
Tehillim,90,14,O satisfy us baboker with Thy chesed; that we may sing for joy and be glad kol yameinu (all our days).
Tehillim,90,15,"Make us glad according to the days wherein Thou hast afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen ra'ah."
Tehillim,90,16,"Let Thy work appear unto Thy avadim, and Thy glory unto their banim."
Tehillim,90,17,"And let the no'am (favor, delightfulness) of Adonoi Eloheinu be upon us; and establish Thou the ma'aseh yadeinu upon us; yes, the ma'aseh yadeinu establish Thou it."
Tehillim,91,1,"He that dwelleth in the seter Elyon (covering, hiding place of the Most High) shall abide under the tzel Shaddai (shadow of the Almighty)."
Tehillim,91,2,"I will say of Hashem , He is my refuge and my fortress; Elohai (my G-d) ; in Him will I trust."
Tehillim,91,3,"Surely He shall save thee from the pach yakosh ([deadly] snare of the fowler) , and from the devastating dever (plague)."
Tehillim,91,4,"He shall cover thee with His evrah (pinion, flight feathers) , and under His kenafayim (wings) shalt thou find defense; His Emes shall be thy shield and buckler."
Tehillim,91,5,Thou shalt not be afraid of the pachad (terror) by lailah; nor of the khetz (arrow) that flieth yomam (by day);
Tehillim,91,6,"Nor for the dever (plague) that walketh in darkness; nor for the ketev (pestilence, destruction) that destroyeth at tzohorayim (noon)."
Tehillim,91,7,"An elef (thousand) may fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy yamin (right hand) ; but it shall not come near thee."
Tehillim,91,8,"Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the shillumah (recompense, retribution) of the resha'im."
Tehillim,91,9,"Because thou hast made Hashem , which is my refuge, even Elyon, thy ma'on (habitation, dwelling),"
Tehillim,91,10,"There shall no ra'ah (evil, disaster) befall thee, neither shall any nega come near thy ohel."
Tehillim,91,11,"For He shall give charge to His malachim (angels) concerning thee, to be shomer over thee in kol drakhim of thee."
Tehillim,91,12,"They shall bear thee up on their palms, lest thou dash thy regel against an even (stone)."
Tehillim,91,13,Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder; the young lion and the tannin (serpent) shalt thou trample under foot.
Tehillim,91,14,"Because he hath set his longing upon Me, therefore will I rescue him; I will set him on high, because he hath da'as of Shmi (My Name)."
Tehillim,91,15,"He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in tzoros; I will deliver him, and honor him."
Tehillim,91,16,"With orech yamim (length of days, long life) will I satisfy him, and show him My Yeshu'ah (salvation)."
Tehillim,92,1,"It is tov to give thanks unto Hashem , and to make music unto Thy Shem, O Elyon;"
Tehillim,92,2,"To proclaim Thy chesed in the boker, and Thy emunah baleilot,"
Tehillim,92,3,"Upon a ten-stringed instrument, and upon the nevel (lyre) ; to the melody of the kinnor (harp)."
Tehillim,92,4,"For Thou, Hashem , hast made me glad through Thy work; I will joy in the works of Thy hands."
Tehillim,92,5," Hashem , how great are Thy works! And Thy machshe'vot (thoughts) are very deep."
Tehillim,92,6,"An ish ba'ar (brutish, senseless man, dolt) knoweth not; neither doth a kesil (fool) understand this."
Tehillim,92,7,"When the resha'im spring up like the esev (grass) , and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish, it is that they shall be destroyed adei-ad (forever)."
Tehillim,92,8,"But Thou, Hashem , art exalted l'olam."
Tehillim,92,9,"For, hinei, Thine enemies, Hashem , for, hinei, Thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered."
Tehillim,92,10,But my keren shalt Thou exalt like the keren of a re'eim (wild ox) ; I shall be anointed with fresh shemen.
Tehillim,92,11,"Mine eye also shall look on mine foes, and mine ears shall hear of the resha'im that rise up against me."
Tehillim,92,12,The tzaddik shall flourish like the palm tree; he shall grow like a cedar in Levanon.
Tehillim,92,13,Those that are planted in the Beis Hashem shall flourish in the khatzerot Eloheinu (courts of our G-d).
Tehillim,92,14,"They shall still bear forth fruit in old age; they shall be deshenim (stalwart, vigorous) and ra'ananim (luxuriant, fresh);"
Tehillim,92,15,"To proclaim that Hashem is yashar; He is my Tzur, and there is no unrighteousness in Him."
Tehillim,93,1," Hashem reigneth, He is robed with majesty; Hashem is clothed with strength, wherewith He hath girded Himself; the tevel (world) also is established, that it cannot be moved."
Tehillim,93,2,Thy kisse is established of old; Thou art me'olam (from everlasting).
Tehillim,93,3,"The floods have lifted up, Hashem , the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves."
Tehillim,93,4," Hashem on high is mightier than the noise of mayim rabbim, yea, than the mighty waves of the yam."
Tehillim,93,5,"Thy testimonies are very sure; Kodesh becometh Thine Beis, Hashem , forever."
Tehillim,94,1," Hashem G-d, to whom vengeance belongeth; O G-d, to whom vengeance belongeth, show Thyself."
Tehillim,94,2,"Rise up, Thou Shofet HaAretz; render gemul (recompense, desert) to the ge'im (proud ones)."
Tehillim,94,3,"Ad mosai, Hashem , shall the resha'im, how long shall the resha'im triumph?"
Tehillim,94,4,How long shall they utter and speak malicious lies? And all the po'alei aven (workers of iniquity) glorify themselves?
Tehillim,94,5,"They crush Thy people, Hashem , and afflict Thine nachalah."
Tehillim,94,6,"They slay the almanah and the ger, and murder the yetomim (fatherless, orphans)."
Tehillim,94,7,"Yet they say, Hashem shall not see, neither shall the Elohei Ya'akov regard it."
Tehillim,94,8,"Understand, ye brutish among the people; and ye kesilim (fools) , when will ye get seichel?"
Tehillim,94,9,"He that planted the ozen (ear) , shall He not hear? He that formed the ayin (eye) , shall He not see?"
Tehillim,94,10,"He that chastiseth the Goyim, shall not He reprove? He that is the melamed (teacher) of da'as to adam?"
Tehillim,94,11," Hashem knoweth the machshevot (thoughts) of adam, that they are hevel (vanity, futile)."
Tehillim,94,12,"Ashrei (blessed) is the gever whom Thou chastenest, Hashem , and teachest him out of Thy torah;"
Tehillim,94,13,"That Thou mayest grant him relief from the days of rah, until a shachat (pit) is dug for the rasha."
Tehillim,94,14,"For Hashem will not cast off His people, neither will He forsake His nachalah."
Tehillim,94,15,But mishpat shall revert unto tzedek; and all the yishrei lev (upright in heart) shall follow after it.
Tehillim,94,16,Who will rise up for Me against the evildoers? Or who will take a stand for Me against the po'alei aven (workers of iniquity)?
Tehillim,94,17,"Unless Hashem had been my help, my nefesh had almost dwelt in dumah (silence)."
Tehillim,94,18,"When I said, My regel (foot) slippeth, Thy chesed, Hashem , held me up."
Tehillim,94,19,In the multitude of my anxieties within me Thy comforts delight my nefesh.
Tehillim,94,20,"Shall the kisse of corruption have chavurah (fellowship) with Thee, those, which deviseth evil by a chok (statute)?"
Tehillim,94,21,"They band together against the nefesh of the tzaddik, and condemn dahm naki (innocent blood)."
Tehillim,94,22,But Hashem is my stronghold; and Elohai is the Tzur of my refuge.
Tehillim,94,23,"And He shall turn back upon them their own iniquity, and shall destroy them for their own wickedness; Hashem Eloheinu shall destroy them."
Tehillim,95,1,"O come, let us sing unto Hashem ; let us make a joyful noise to the Tzur of our salvation."
Tehillim,95,2,"Let us come before His presence with todah, and extol Him with zemirot (joyful songs)."
Tehillim,95,3,"For Hashem is El Gadol, and Melech Gadol above kol elohim (g-ds)."
Tehillim,95,4,In His yad are the deep places of ha'aretz; the peaks of the harim are His also.
Tehillim,95,5,"The yam is His, and He made it; and His hands formed the yabashah (dry land)."
Tehillim,95,6,"O come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before Hashem Oseinu (our Maker)."
Tehillim,95,7,"For He is Eloheinu; and we are the people of His pasture, and the tzon of His yad. Today if ye will hear His voice,"
Tehillim,95,8,"Harden not your lev, as in Merivah, and as in the Yom Massah in the midbar;"
Tehillim,95,9,"When your avot tested Me, tried Me, and saw My work."
Tehillim,95,10,"Arba'im shanah was I grieved with this generation, and said, It is a people that do stray in their lev, and they have no da'as of My ways;"
Tehillim,95,11,Unto whom I swore an oath in My wrath that they should not enter into My menuchah.
Tehillim,96,1,"O sing unto Hashem a shir chadash; sing unto Hashem , kol ha'aretz."
Tehillim,96,2,"Sing unto Hashem , barakhu Shmo, show forth His Yeshu'ah (salvation) from day to day."
Tehillim,96,3,"Declare His kavod among the Goyim, His nifle'ot (marvelous deeds) among all peoples."
Tehillim,96,4,"For Hashem is gadol, and me'od to be praised; He is to be feared above all elohim."
Tehillim,96,5,For kol elohei HaAmim are elilim (idols) ; but Hashem made Shomayim.
Tehillim,96,6,Hod and hadar are before Him; oz and tiferet are in His Mikdash.
Tehillim,96,7,"Render unto Hashem , O ye mishpekhot of the nations, render unto Hashem kavod and oz."
Tehillim,96,8,"Render unto Hashem the kavod due unto Shmo; bring a minchah, and come into His khatzerot (courtyards)."
Tehillim,96,9,"O worship Hashem in the hadrat Kodesh; fear before Him, kol ha'aretz."
Tehillim,96,10,"Say among the Goyim that Hashem reigneth; the tevel also is established that it shall not be moved; He shall judge the Amim bemeysharim (in equity, in uprightness)."
Tehillim,96,11,"Let Shomayim rejoice, and let ha'aretz be glad; let the yam roar, and the fullness thereof."
Tehillim,96,12,"Let the sadeh be jubilant, and all that is therein; then shall kol atzei ya'ar (all the trees of the forest) sing for joy"
Tehillim,96,13,"Before Hashem ; for He cometh, for He cometh to judge ha'aretz; He shall judge tevel betzedek (world in righteousness) , and Amim with His emunah (truth)."
Tehillim,97,1, Hashem reigneth; let ha'aretz rejoice; let the multitude of isles thereof be glad.
Tehillim,97,2,Anan and darkness are round about Him; tzedek and mishpat are the foundation of His kisse.
Tehillim,97,3,"Eish goeth before Him, and burneth up His enemies on every side."
Tehillim,97,4,"His lightnings light up the tevel; ha'aretz saw, and trembled."
Tehillim,97,5,"The harim melted like wax at the presence of Hashem , at the presence of Adon kol HaAretz."
Tehillim,97,6,"HaShomayim declare His tzedek, and kol ha'amim see His kavod."
Tehillim,97,7,"Shamed be all they that serve pesel, that boast themselves of elilim; worship Him, kol elohim."
Tehillim,97,8,"Tziyon heard, and was glad; and the banot Yehudah rejoiced because of Thy mishpatim, Hashem."
Tehillim,97,9,"For Thou, Hashem , art Elyon above kol ha'aretz; Thou art exalted far above kol elohim."
Tehillim,97,10,"Ye that love Hashem , hate rah; He preserveth the nefashot of His chasidim; He delivereth them out of the yad resha'im."
Tehillim,97,11,"Ohr dawns for the tzaddik, and simchah for the yishrei lev (upright in heart)."
Tehillim,97,12,"Rejoice in Hashem , ye tzaddikim; and give thanks at the remembrance of His kodesh (holiness)."
Tehillim,98,1,"O sing unto Hashem a shir chadash; for He hath done marvellous things; His right hand, and His zero'a kodesh, hath gotten Him victory."
Tehillim,98,2, Hashem hath made known His Yeshu'ah (salvation) ; His tzedek hath He openly showed in the sight of the Goyim.
Tehillim,98,3,He hath remembered His chesed and His emes toward the Bais Yisroel; all the ends of ha'aretz have seen the Yeshu'at Eloheinu (salvation of our G-d).
Tehillim,98,4,"Make a joyful noise unto Hashem , kol ha'aretz; make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise."
Tehillim,98,5,"Sing unto Hashem with the kinnor; with the kinnor, and the voice of singing."
Tehillim,98,6,With trumpets and sound of the shofar make a joyful noise before HaMelech Hashem.
Tehillim,98,7,"Let the yam roar, and the fullness thereof; the tevel, and they that dwell therein."
Tehillim,98,8,Let the floods clap their hands; let the harim be joyful together
Tehillim,98,9,"Before Hashem ; for He cometh to judge ha'aretz; with tzedek shall He judge the tevel, and the people with meisharim (uprightness)."
Tehillim,99,1, Hashem reigneth; let the nations tremble; He sitteth between the keruvim; let ha'aretz be shaken.
Tehillim,99,2, Hashem is great in Tziyon; and He is high above all the nations.
Tehillim,99,3,Let them praise Thy Shem gadol v'nora; for it is kadosh.
Tehillim,99,4,"The Mighty King also loveth mishpat; Thou dost establish equity, Thou executest mishpat and tzedakah in Ya'akov."
Tehillim,99,5,"Exalt ye Hashem Eloheinu, and worship at His footstool; for He is kadosh."
Tehillim,99,6,"Moshe and Aharon among His kohanim, and Shmuel among them that call upon Shmo; they called upon Hashem , and He answered them."
Tehillim,99,7,"He spoke unto them in the ammud anan (pillar of cloud) ; they were shomer over His statutes, and the chok (ordinance) that He gave them."
Tehillim,99,8,"Thou answeredst them, Hashem Eloheinu; Thou wast El (G-d) that forgavest them, though Thou tookest vengeance of their misdeeds."
Tehillim,99,9,"Exalt Hashem Eloheinu, and worship at His Har Kodesh; for Hashem Eloheinu is kadosh."
Tehillim,100,1,"Make a joyful shout unto Hashem , all ye lands."
Tehillim,100,2,Serve Hashem with simchah; come before His presence with joyful singing.
Tehillim,100,3,"Know ye that Hashem He is Elohim; it is He that hath made us, and not we ourselves, His people, the tzon of His pasture."
Tehillim,100,4,"Enter into His she'arim (gates) with todah, and into His khatzerot (courts) with tehillah; be thankful unto Him, and bless Shmo."
Tehillim,100,5,For Hashem is good; His chesed is l'olam; and His emunah (faithfulness) endureth dor vador.
Tehillim,101,1,"I will sing of chesed and mishpat; unto Thee, Hashem , will I sing."
Tehillim,101,2,I will study the derech tamim. O when wilt Thou come unto me? I will walk within my bais with tam levav.
Tehillim,101,3,I will set no devar beliyya'al before mine eyes; I hate the work of them that fall away; it shall not cleave to me.
Tehillim,101,4,A lev ikkesh (perverse heart) shall be far from me; I will not tolerate rah.
Tehillim,101,5,"The one who slandereth ba'seter (in secret) his neighbor, him will I destroy; him that hath haughty einayim (eyes) and a proud levav will I not endure."
Tehillim,101,6,"Mine eyes shall be upon the ne'emenei eretz (faithful of the land) , that they may dwell with me; he that walketh in a derech tamim, he shall minister to me."
Tehillim,101,7,"He that worketh remiyyah (deceit) shall not dwell within my bais; he that speaketh shekarim (falsehoods, lies) shall not continue in my presence."
Tehillim,101,8,In the bokerim I will destroy all rishei eretz (wicked ones of the land) ; that I may cut off all doers of evil from the Ir Hashem.
Tehillim,102,1,"Hear my tefillah, Hashem , and let my cry for help come unto Thee."
Tehillim,102,2,"Hide not Thy face from me in the yom tzar (day of distress) ; incline Thine ear unto me; in the yom when I call, answer me speedily."
Tehillim,102,3,"For my yamim are consumed like ashan (smoke) , and my atzmot burn like a furnace."
Tehillim,102,4,"My lev is struck, and withered like esev; so that I forget to eat my lechem."
Tehillim,102,5,By reason of the voice of my groaning my atzmot have deveykus to my basar.
Tehillim,102,6,I am like a bird of the midbar; I am like an owl of the desert.
Tehillim,102,7,"I keep watch, and am like a tzippor (bird) alone upon the gag (housetop, roof)."
Tehillim,102,8,Mine oyevim (enemies) reproach me kol hayom; and they that revile me curse by me.
Tehillim,102,9,"For I have eaten ashes like lechem, and mingled my drink with tears."
Tehillim,102,10,"Because of Thine za'am (indignation) and Thy ketsef (wrath, anger) ; for Thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down."
Tehillim,102,11,My days are like a tzel (shadow) that lengtheneth; and I am withered like esev (grass).
Tehillim,102,12,"But Thou, Hashem , shall endure l'olam; and Thy memory unto dor vador."
Tehillim,102,13,"Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Tziyon; for the time to favor her, the mo'ed (set time, appointed time) has come."
Tehillim,102,14,"For Thy avadim cherish her avanim (stones) , and pity her aphar."
Tehillim,102,15,"So the Goyim shall fear the Shem Hashem , and all the melachim of ha'aretz will revere Thy glory."
Tehillim,102,16,"When Hashem shall build up Tziyon, He shall appear in His Kavod."
Tehillim,102,17,"He will regard the tefillah of the destitute, and not despise their tefillah."
Tehillim,102,18,This shall be written for a dor acharon (future generation) ; and the people which shall be created shall praise Hashem.
Tehillim,102,19,For He hath looked down from the height of His Kodesh; from Shomayim did Hashem behold Eretz;
Tehillim,102,20,To hear the groaning of the asir (prisoner) ; to release those that are bnei temutah (men death);
Tehillim,102,21,"To declare the Shem Hashem in Tziyon, and His tehillah (praise) in Yerushalayim;"
Tehillim,102,22,"When the peoples are gathered together in assembly, and the mamlachot (kingdoms) , to serve Hashem."
Tehillim,102,23,He bowed down my ko'ach in the derech; He cut short my yamim.
Tehillim,102,24,"I said, O my G-d, take me not away in the midst of my yamim; Thy years are dor dorim (throughout all generations)."
Tehillim,102,25,Of old hast Thou laid the foundation of ha'aretz; and Shomayim is the ma'aseh (work) of Thy hands.
Tehillim,102,26,"They shall perish, but Thou shalt remain; and all of them shall wear out like a beged (garment) ; like a vesture shalt Thou change them, and they shall be changed;"
Tehillim,102,27,"But Thou art the same, and Thy shanot (years) shall have no end."
Tehillim,102,28,"The children of Thy avadim shall dwell, and their zera shall be established before Thee."
Tehillim,103,1,"Barachi (Bless) Hashem , O my nefesh; and all that is within me, bless His Shem kodesh."
Tehillim,103,2,"Barachi Hashem , O my nefesh, and forget not all His gmulim (benefits);"
Tehillim,103,3,Who forgiveth all thine avonim (iniquities) ; Who healeth all thy diseases;
Tehillim,103,4,"Who is the Go'el (Redeemer) of thy life from shachat (corruption, pit, grave) ; Who crowneth thee with chesed and rachamim;"
Tehillim,103,5,Who satisfieth thy mouth with tov; so that thy ne'urim is made chadash like the nesher.
Tehillim,103,6, Hashem executeth tzedakot and mishpatim for all that are oppressed.
Tehillim,103,7,"He made known His drakhim unto Moshe, His deeds unto the Bnei Yisroel."
Tehillim,103,8," Hashem is rachum and channun, slow to anger, and plenteous in chesed."
Tehillim,103,9,He will not strive l'netzach; neither will He keep His anger l'olam.
Tehillim,103,10,He hath not dealt with us according to chata'einu (our sins) ; nor repaid us according to avonoteinu (our iniquities).
Tehillim,103,11,"For as Shomayim is high above ha'aretz, so great is His chesed toward them that fear Him."
Tehillim,103,12,"As far as the mizrach (east) is from the ma'arav (west) , so far hath He removed peysha'einu (our transgressions) from us."
Tehillim,103,13,As an av has compassion on banim so Hashem has compassion on them that fear Him.
Tehillim,103,14,For He has da'as of yitzreinu (our nature) ; He remembereth that aphar anachnu (dust we are).
Tehillim,103,15,"As for enosh (mankind) , his yamim are like khatzir (green grass, herbage) ; like tzitz hasadeh (a flower of the field) , so he flourisheth."
Tehillim,103,16,"For the ruach (wind) passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall remember it no more."
Tehillim,103,17,"But the chesed Hashem is me'olam v'ad olam (from everlasting to everlasting) upon them that fear Him, and His tzedakah unto bnei banim;"
Tehillim,103,18,"To such as are shomer over His Brit, and to those that remember His precepts to do them."
Tehillim,103,19, Hashem hath established His kisse (throne) in Shomayim; and His malchut ruleth over all.
Tehillim,103,20,"Barachu Hashem , ye His malachim, gibborei ko'ach (mighty ones of power) , that do His bidding, paying heed unto the voice of His Davar."
Tehillim,103,21,"Barachu Hashem , all ye His Tzivos; ye mesharetim (ministers) of His, that do His ratzon (will)."
Tehillim,103,22,"Barachu Hashem , all His ma'asim in all places of His memshalet (dominion) ; Barachi Hashem , O my nefesh."
Tehillim,104,1,"Barachi (bless) Hashem , O my nefesh. Hashem Elohai, Thou art gadol me'od; Thou art clothed with hod (honor) and hadar (majesty)."
Tehillim,104,2,Who coverest Thyself with ohr (light) as with a garment; Who stretchest out Shomayim like a tent (curtain);
Tehillim,104,3,Who layeth the beams of His aliyyot (upper rooms) on the mayim; Who maketh the clouds His merkavah; Who walketh upon the wings of the ruach (wind);
Tehillim,104,4,"Who maketh ruchot (spirits, winds) His malachim; His mesharetim (ministers) , flaming eish;"
Tehillim,104,5,"Who laid the mekhonim (foundations) of ha'aretz, that it should not move out of place olam va'ed."
Tehillim,104,6,Thou coveredst it with the tehom (deep) as with a garment; the mayim stood above the harim (mountains).
Tehillim,104,7,At Thy ga'arah (rebuke) they fled; at the voice of Thy thunder they hasted away.
Tehillim,104,8,They go up by the harim (mountains) ; they go down by the beka'ot (valleys) unto the makom (place) which Thou hast assigned for them.
Tehillim,104,9,Thou hast set a boundary that they may not pass over; that they return not to cover ha'aretz.
Tehillim,104,10,"He sendeth the ma'ayanim (springs) into the ravines, which run among the harim."
Tehillim,104,11,They give drink to every beast of the sadeh; the pera'im (donkeys) quench their thirst.
Tehillim,104,12,"By them shall the oph HaShomayim have their habitation, which sing among the branches."
Tehillim,104,13,He watereth the harim from His aliyyot (upper rooms) ; ha'aretz is satisfied with the p'ri (fruit) of Thy ma'asim.
Tehillim,104,14,"He causeth the khatzir (grass) to grow for the behemah, and esev for the avodas ha'adam; that he may bring forth lechem out of ha'aretz;"
Tehillim,104,15,"And yayin that maketh glad levav enosh, and shemen to make panim (faces) to shine, and lechem which strengtheneth levav enosh."
Tehillim,104,16,"The trees of Hashem are full of sap, the arazim (cedars) of Levanon, which He hath planted;"
Tehillim,104,17,"Where the tzipporim (birds) make their nests; as for the khasidah (stork) , the beroshim (cypresses) are her bais."
Tehillim,104,18,"The high hills are a makhseh (refuge, shelter) for the wild goats; and the rocks for the gophers."
Tehillim,104,19,He appointed the yarei'ach for mo'adim; the shemesh knoweth the place of its going down.
Tehillim,104,20,"Thou makest choshech, and it is lailah; wherein all the beasts of the ya'ar (forest) do creep forth."
Tehillim,104,21,"The young lions roar after their teref (prey) , and seek their okhel from G-d."
Tehillim,104,22,"The shemesh ariseth, they retreat, and lay themselves down in their me'onot (dwelling places, dens, homes)."
Tehillim,104,23,"Adam goeth forth unto his work and to his avodah (labor, service) until erev."
Tehillim,104,24," Hashem , how manifold are Thy ma'asim! In chochmah (wisdom) hast Thou made them all; ha'aretz is full of Thy riches."
Tehillim,104,25,"So is this gadol (great) and rekhav (wide, spacious) yam (sea) , wherein are remes (creeping things) , innumerable swarming chayyot (creatures) , ketanot and gedolot."
Tehillim,104,26,"There go the oniyyot (ships) ; there is that Leviathan, whom Thou hast made lesakhek (to play, to sport, to frolic) therein."
Tehillim,104,27,These wait all upon Thee; that Thou mayest give them their ochel (food) in due season.
Tehillim,104,28,"That Thou givest them they gather; Thou openest Thine yad, they are satisfied with tov."
Tehillim,104,29,"Thou hidest Thy face, they are troubled; Thou takest away their ruach, they expire, and return to their aphar."
Tehillim,104,30,"Thou sendest forth Thy Ruach, they are created; and Thou renewest the face of adamah (earth)."
Tehillim,104,31,The Kavod Hashem shall endure l'olam; Hashem shall rejoice in His ma'asim (works).
Tehillim,104,32,"He looketh on ha'aretz, and it trembleth; He toucheth the harim, and they smoke."
Tehillim,104,33,I will sing unto Hashem as long as I live; I will sing praise to Elohai while I have my being.
Tehillim,104,34,"May my si'akh (musing, meditation) be acceptable to Him; I will have simchah in Hashem."
Tehillim,104,35,"Let the chatta'im (sinners) be consumed from ha'aretz, and let the resha'im (wicked) be no more. Baruch Hashem , O my nefesh. Praise Hashem!"
Tehillim,105,1,O give thanks unto Hashem ; call upon Shmo; make known His deeds among the amim.
Tehillim,105,2,"Sing unto Him, sing praise unto Him; talk ye of all His nifle'ot (wondrous works)."
Tehillim,105,3,Glory ye in the Shem Kadosh of Him; let the lev of them that seek Hashem be glad.
Tehillim,105,4,"Seek Hashem , and His oz (strength) ; seek His face tamid."
Tehillim,105,5,"Remember His nifla'ot (marvellous works) that He hath done; His mofetim (wonders) , and the mishpatim of His mouth;"
Tehillim,105,6,"O ye zera Avraham His eved, ye Bnei Ya'akov His Bechirim (chosen ones)."
Tehillim,105,7,He is Hashem Eloheinu; His mishpatim are in kol ha'aretz.
Tehillim,105,8,"He hath remembered His Brit l'olam, the Dvar which He commanded to an elef dor (a thousand generations),"
Tehillim,105,9,"Which Brit He made with Avraham, and His shevu'ah (oath) unto Yitzchak;"
Tehillim,105,10,"And confirmed the same unto Ya'akov for a chok (decree) , and to Yisroel as Brit Olam;"
Tehillim,105,11,"Saying, Unto thee will I give Eretz Kena'an, the chevel (lot, portion) of your nachalah."
Tehillim,105,12,"When they were but few in mispar (number) , very few, and gerim (strangers) in it."
Tehillim,105,13,"When they went from one goy (nation) to another, from one mamlachah (kingdom) to am acher (another people);"
Tehillim,105,14,He permitted no adam to oppress them; and He reproved melachim for their sakes;
Tehillim,105,15,"Saying, Touch not Mine meshichim (anointed ones, My Messianics) , and do My nevi'im no harm."
Tehillim,105,16,"Moreover He called for a ra'av (famine) upon ha'aretz; He broke the kol matteh (whole staff of, all supply of) lechem."
Tehillim,105,17,"He sent an ish before them, even Yosef, who was sold as an eved (slave);"
Tehillim,105,18,Whose regel they hurt with the kevel (shackle) ; his nefesh was laid in barzel;
Tehillim,105,19,"Until the time that his dvar (prophecy, word) came to pass; the Imrat Hashem (revelation, word of G-d), had tested him."
Tehillim,105,20,"The Melech sent and released him, the Moshel Amim, and set him free."
Tehillim,105,21,"He made him adon of his bais, and moshel of all his possessions;"
Tehillim,105,22,To bind his sarim (princes) at his pleasure; and teach his zekenim chochmah.
Tehillim,105,23,Yisroel also came into Mitzrayim; thus Ya'akov sojourned in Eretz Cham.
Tehillim,105,24,And He increased Amo (His people) greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.
Tehillim,105,25,"He turned their lev to hate Amo, to deal cunningly with His avadim."
Tehillim,105,26,He sent Moshe His Eved; and Aharon whom He had chosen.
Tehillim,105,27,"They showed His Otot (signs) among them, and mofetim (wonders) in Eretz Cham."
Tehillim,105,28,"He sent choshech, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against His Devar."
Tehillim,105,29,"He turned their mayim into dahm, and made their dag (fish) die."
Tehillim,105,30,"Their land brought forth tzfarde'im (frogs) in abundance, even in the chadarim (rooms) of their melachim."
Tehillim,105,31,"He spoke, and there came arov (flies) , and kinim (lice) in all their territory."
Tehillim,105,32,"He gave them barad (hail) for geshem (rain) , and eish of lightning in their land."
Tehillim,105,33,He struck down their gefen also and their te'enah (fig tree) ; and broke the trees of their territory.
Tehillim,105,34,"He spoke, and the arbeh (locusts) came, and grasshoppers, and that without number,"
Tehillim,105,35,"And did eat up all the esev (herbs) in their land, and devoured their p'ri adamah (fruit of the ground)."
Tehillim,105,36,"He struck down also kol bechor in their land, the reshit (firstfruit) of all their strength."
Tehillim,105,37,He brought them forth also with kesef and zahav; and there was not one stumbling among His Shvatim (tribes).
Tehillim,105,38,"Mitzrayim was glad when they departed; for the pachad (terror, dread) of them had fallen upon them."
Tehillim,105,39,He spread an anan for a curtain; and eish to give light in the lailah.
Tehillim,105,40,"The people asked, and He brought slav (quails) , and satisfied them with the lechem Shomayim."
Tehillim,105,41,"He opened the Tzur, and the mayim gushed out; it ran in the dry places like a nahar."
Tehillim,105,42,"For He remembered His Davar Kadosh, and Avraham His eved."
Tehillim,105,43,"And He brought forth His people with sasson, and His chosen with joyful shouts;"
Tehillim,105,44,"And gave them the lands of the Goyim; and they inherited the amal (labor, toil) of the amim;"
Tehillim,105,45,"That they might be shomer over His chukkot, and observe His torot (laws) . Praise Hashem."
Tehillim,106,1,Praise Hashem ! O give thanks unto Hashem ; for He is tov; for His chesed endureth l'olam.
Tehillim,106,2,Who can speak of the gevurot (mighty acts) of Hashem ? Who can show forth all His tehillah (praise)?
Tehillim,106,3,"Ashrei (happy, blessed) are they who are shomrei mishpat, and he that doeth tzedakah at all times."
Tehillim,106,4,"Remember me, Hashem , with the favor that Thou bearest unto Thy people; O visit me with Thy Yeshu'ah (salvation);"
Tehillim,106,5,"That I may see the good of Bechireicha (Thy chosen ones) , that I may rejoice in the simchah of Thy nation, that I may glory with Thine nachalah (the people of Thy inheritance)."
Tehillim,106,6,"We have sinned with Avoteinu, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly."
Tehillim,106,7,"Avoteinu had no seichal concerning Thy nifla'ot (wonders) in Mitzrayim; they remembered not the multitude of Thy mercies but provoked Him at the yam, even at the Yam Suf."
Tehillim,106,8,"Nevertheless He saved them for the sake of Shmo, that He might make His gevu'rot (mighty power) to be known."
Tehillim,106,9,"He rebuked the Yam Suf also, and it dried up; so He led them through the tehomot, as through the midbar."
Tehillim,106,10,"And He saved them from the yad of him that hated them, and He acted to make the go'el redemption from the yad of the oyev (enemy)."
Tehillim,106,11,And the mayim covered their enemies; there was not echad (one) of them left surviving.
Tehillim,106,12,Then believed they in His Devarim; they sang His tehillah.
Tehillim,106,13,"Then they hurried, they forgot His ma'asim; they waited not for His etzah (counsel, advice, wisdom);"
Tehillim,106,14,"But lusted exceedingly in the midbar, and tempted G-d in the desert."
Tehillim,106,15,And He gave them their she'elah (request) ; but sent leanness into their nefesh.
Tehillim,106,16,"They envied Moshe also in the machaneh, and Aharon the kadosh Hashem (Aharon the holy one of Hashem)."
Tehillim,106,17,Eretz opened and swallowed up Datan and covered over the Adat Aviram (the company of Aviram).
Tehillim,106,18,And an eish was kindled in their edah (assembly) ; the flame burned up the resha'im.
Tehillim,106,19,"They made an egel (a calf) in Chorev, and worshiped a massekhah (molden image)."
Tehillim,106,20,Thus they exchanged their kavod for a tavnit shor (likeness of an ox) that eateth esev (grass).
Tehillim,106,21,"They forgot G-d their Moshi'a, Who had done gedolot in Mitzrayim;"
Tehillim,106,22,"Nifla'ot (wondrous works) in Eretz Cham, and nora'ot (awesome things) by the Yam Suf."
Tehillim,106,23,"Therefore He said that He would destroy them, had not Moshe His bechir (chosen one) stood before Him in the peretz (breach) , to turn away His wrath, lest He should destroy them."
Tehillim,106,24,Then they despised the eretz chemdah (desirable land) ; they believed not His Devar;
Tehillim,106,25,"But murmured in their ohalim, and paid heed not unto the kol (voice) of Hashem."
Tehillim,106,26,"Therefore He lifted up His yad against them, that He would overthrow them in the midbar;"
Tehillim,106,27,"To make their zera fall also among the Goyim, and to scatter them among the aratzot (lands)."
Tehillim,106,28,"They joined themselves also unto Ba'al-Pe'or, and ate the zivkhei mesim (sacrifices offered to the dead)."
Tehillim,106,29,Thus they provoked Him to anger with their inventions; and the magefah (plague) broke out among them.
Tehillim,106,30,"Then stood up Pinchas, and interposed; and so the magefah (plague) was halted."
Tehillim,106,31,And that was counted unto him for tzedakah l'dor vador ad olam.
Tehillim,106,32,"They angered Him also at the waters of Merivah, so that it went ill with Moshe on their account;"
Tehillim,106,33,Because they provoked His Ruach and he spoke unadvisedly with his sfatayim (lips).
Tehillim,106,34,"They did not destroy the amim (peoples) , as Hashem commanded them;"
Tehillim,106,35,"But they mingled with the Goyim, and learned their ma'asim (works, customs)."
Tehillim,106,36,And they served their atzabim (idols) ; which were a mokesh (snare) unto them.
Tehillim,106,37,"And, they sacrificed their banim and their banot unto shedim (demons),"
Tehillim,106,38,"And they shed dahm naki (innocent blood) , even the dahm of their banim and of their banot, whom they sacrificed unto the atzabei Kena'an (idols of Canaan) ; and HaAretz was polluted with blood-guilt."
Tehillim,106,39,"Thus they made themselves tameh with their own ma'asim, and went a-whoring with their own inventions."
Tehillim,106,40,"Therefore was the wrath of Hashem kindled against His people, insomuch that He abhorred His own nachalah."
Tehillim,106,41,And He gave them into the yad Goyim; and they that hated them ruled over them.
Tehillim,106,42,"Their oyevim also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their yad."
Tehillim,106,43,"Many times did He deliver them; but they provoked Him with their etzah (counsel) , and so perished in their avon (iniquity)."
Tehillim,106,44,"Nevertheless He regarded their affliction, when He heard their rinnah (cry of grief);"
Tehillim,106,45,"And He remembered for their sake His Brit, and relented according to the multitude of His chasadim (lovingkindnesses)."
Tehillim,106,46,He made them also to be pitied with rachamim by all those that carried them away as captives.
Tehillim,106,47,"Hoshieini (save us), Hashem Eloheinu, and gather us from among the Goyim, to give thanks unto Thy Shem Kadosh, and to glory in Thy tehillah (praise)."
Tehillim,106,48,"Baruch Hashem Elohei Yisroel min haOlam v'ad haOlam; and let kol HaAm say, Omein. Praise Hashem!"
Tehillim,107,1,"O give thanks unto Hashem , for He is tov; ki l'olam chasdo (for His mercy endureth forever)."
Tehillim,107,2,"Let the Geulei Hashem (the redeemed of Hashem) say so, whom He hath redeemed from the yad tzar;"
Tehillim,107,3,"And gathered them out of the lands, from the mizrach (east) , and from the ma'arav (west) , from the tzafon (north) , and from the yam (sea)."
Tehillim,107,4,They wandered in the midbar in a desolate region; they found no derech to an ir moshav (inhabited city).
Tehillim,107,5,"Re'evim (hungry) and tzeme'im (thirsty) , their nefesh fainted within them."
Tehillim,107,6,"Then they cried unto Hashem in their tzoros, and He delivered them out of their distresses."
Tehillim,107,7,And He led them forth by the derech yesharah that they might go to an ir moshav.
Tehillim,107,8,"Oh that men would praise Hashem for His chesed, and for His nifla'ot (wonderful works) to the Bnei Adam!"
Tehillim,107,9,"For He satisfieth the longing nefesh, and filleth the hungry nefesh with the tov."
Tehillim,107,10,"Such as sit in choshech and in tzalmavet, being bound in oni and barzel (iron);"
Tehillim,107,11,"Because they rebelled against the words of G-d, and despised the atzat Elyon (counsel of the Most High);"
Tehillim,107,12,"Therefore He brought down their lev with amal (toil) ; they stumbled, and there was no ozer (helper)."
Tehillim,107,13,"Then they cried out unto Hashem in their tzoros, and He saved them out of their distresses."
Tehillim,107,14,"He brought them out of choshech and tzalmavet, and broke apart their chains."
Tehillim,107,15,"Oh that men would praise Hashem for His chesed, and for His nifla'ot (wonderful works) to the Bnei Adam!"
Tehillim,107,16,"For He hath broken down the dlatot nechoshet, and cut asunder the bars of barzel (iron)."
Tehillim,107,17,"Fools because of their derech peysha, and because of their avonot (iniquities) , were afflicted."
Tehillim,107,18,Their nefesh abhorreth all manner of ochel (food) ; and they drew near unto the sha'arei mavet (gates of death).
Tehillim,107,19,"Then they cried unto Hashem in their tzoros, and He saveth them out of their distresses."
Tehillim,107,20,"He sent His Davar, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions."
Tehillim,107,21,"Oh that men would praise Hashem for His chesed, and for His nifla'ot (wonderful works) to the Bnei Adam!"
Tehillim,107,22,"And let them sacrifice the zivkhei todah (sacrifices of thanksgiving) , and recount His works with joyful singing."
Tehillim,107,23,"They that go down to the yam in oniyot (ships) , that do business on mayim rabbim (great waters);"
Tehillim,107,24,"These have seen the ma'asei Hashem , and His nifla'ot (wonders) in the deep."
Tehillim,107,25,"For He commandeth, and raiseth up a ruach sa'arah (stormy wind) , which lifteth up the galim (waves) thereof."
Tehillim,107,26,"They mount up to Shomayim, they went down again to the tehomot (depths) ; their nefesh melted in ra'ah (peril, trouble)."
Tehillim,107,27,"They reeled and staggered like a shikkor, and were at their witʼs end."
Tehillim,107,28,"Then they cried unto Hashem in their tzoros, and He brought them out of their distresses."
Tehillim,107,29,"He made the sa'arah (storm) a calm, so that the galim (waves) thereof were still."
Tehillim,107,30,"Then were they glad because they were quiet; so He brought them unto their makhoz chefetz (desired haven, city, district, boundary)."
Tehillim,107,31,"Oh that men would praise Hashem for His chesed, and for His nifla'ot (wonderful works) to the Bnei Adam!"
Tehillim,107,32,"Let them exalt Him also in the Kehal Am, and praise Him in the moshav zekenim (council of the elders)."
Tehillim,107,33,"He turneth neharot (rivers) into a midbar, and the springs of water into dry ground;"
Tehillim,107,34,"An eretz p'ri (fruitful land) into salt wasteland, because of the wickedness of them that dwell therein."
Tehillim,107,35,"He turneth the midbar into an agam (pool, lake) of mayim, and dry ground into springs of water."
Tehillim,107,36,"And there He maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may found an ir moshav (an inhabited city);"
Tehillim,107,37,"And sow the sadot, and plant kramim, and acquire p'ri tevu'ah (fruits of increase)."
Tehillim,107,38,"He made a brocha on them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and He doth not permit their behemah to decrease."
Tehillim,107,39,"Again, they are diminished and brought low through otzer (oppression) , ra'ah (calamity, peril, trouble) and yagon (sorrow, grief)."
Tehillim,107,40,"He poureth contempt upon nedivim (nobles) , and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no derech."
Tehillim,107,41,"Yet setteth He the evyon (needy) up above oni (affliction) , and maketh him mishpekhot like a tzon (flock)."
Tehillim,107,42,"The yesharim (upright ones) shall see it, and rejoice with simchah; and all iniquity shall shut its mouth."
Tehillim,107,43,"Whosoever is chacham, and will be shomer over these things, even they shall understand the chasdei Hashem (lovingkindnesses of Hashem)."
Tehillim,108,1,"O Elohim, my lev is nachon; I will sing and make music, even with my kavod (glory, soul)."
Tehillim,108,2,"Awake, nevel and kinnor; I will awaken the shachar (dawn)."
Tehillim,108,3,"I will praise Thee, Hashem , among the peoples; and I will sing praises unto Thee among the nations."
Tehillim,108,4,For Thy chesed is gadol above Shomayim; and Thy emes reacheth unto the clouds.
Tehillim,108,5,"Be Thou exalted, Elohim, above Shomayim; and Thy kavod above kol ha'aretz;"
Tehillim,108,6,"That Thy beloved may be delivered; hoshiah (save) with Thy Yamin, and answer me."
Tehillim,108,7,"Elohim hath spoken in His Kodesh; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and measure out the Valley of Sukkot."
Tehillim,108,8,Gil'ad is Mine; Menasheh is Mine; Ephrayim also is the maoz of Mine rosh; Yehudah is My mechokek (lawgiver);
Tehillim,108,9,Moav is My washbasin; over Edom will I toss My na'al (sandal) ; over Philistia will I shout in triumph.
Tehillim,108,10,Who will bring me into the fortified city? Who will lead me into Edom?
Tehillim,108,11,"Wilt not Thou, Elohim, Who hast cast us off? And wilt not Thou, Elohim, go forth with our Tzivos?"
Tehillim,108,12,Give us help against the enemy; for vain is the teshuat adam (help of man).
Tehillim,108,13,Through Elohim we shall do valiantly; for He it is that shall tread down our enemies.
Tehillim,109,1,"Hold not Thy peace, O Elohei tehillati;"
Tehillim,109,2,For the mouth of the rasha and the mouth of the mirmah are opened against me; they have spoken against me with a leshon sheker (a lying tongue).
Tehillim,109,3,They surrounded me also with divrei sinah (words of hatred) ; and attacked me without cause.
Tehillim,109,4,In return for my ahavah they are my adversaries; but I give myself unto tefillah (prayer).
Tehillim,109,5,"Thus they have laid upon me ra'ah for tovah, and sinah for my ahavah."
Tehillim,109,6,Set Thou a rasha (wicked man) over him; and let Satan (the Accuser) stand at his yamin (right hand).
Tehillim,109,7,"When he shall be tried, let him be in the judgment condemned; and let his tefillah (prayer) become sin."
Tehillim,109,8,Let his yamim be few; and let another take his pekuddah.
Tehillim,109,9,"Let his banim be yetomim, and his isha an almanah."
Tehillim,109,10,"Let his banim be continually vagabonds, and beg; let them seek from their ruins."
Tehillim,109,11,Let the nosheh (creditor) seize all that he hath; and let the zarim (strangers) plunder his labor.
Tehillim,109,12,Let there be none to extend chesed unto him; neither let there be any to favor his yetomim.
Tehillim,109,13,Let his posterity be cut off; and in the dor acher (generation following) let their shem be blotted out.
Tehillim,109,14,Let the avon of his avot be remembered before Hashem ; and let not the chattat immo be blotted out.
Tehillim,109,15,"Let them be before Hashem tamid, that He may cut off the memory of them from ha'aretz."
Tehillim,109,16,"Because he remembered not to show chesed, but persecuted the ish oni and the evyon, that he might even slay the nikheh levav (broken-hearted person)."
Tehillim,109,17,"As he loved kelalah (cursing) , so it came on him; as he delighted not in brocha (blessing) , so it was far from him."
Tehillim,109,18,"As he clothed himself with kelalah as with his garment, so let it come into his inward parts like mayim, and like shemen into his atzmot."
Tehillim,109,19,"Let it be unto him like a beged which covereth him, and for a belt wherewith he is girded tamid (continually)."
Tehillim,109,20,"This is the reward of mine adversaries from Hashem , and of them that speak rah against my nefesh."
Tehillim,109,21,"But Thou O Hashem Adonoi, do with me for the sake of Thy Name; because Thy chesed is tov, deliver Thou me."
Tehillim,109,22,"For I am oni and evyon, and my lev is wounded within me."
Tehillim,109,23,I am gone like a lengthening tzel (shadow) ; I am shaken off like the arbeh.
Tehillim,109,24,My knees are weak from a tzom; and my basar faileth of fatness.
Tehillim,109,25,"I became also a cherpah (reproach) unto them; when they looked upon me, they shaked their heads."
Tehillim,109,26,"Help me, O Hashem Elohai; O hoshi'eini (save me) according to Thy chesed;"
Tehillim,109,27,"That they may know that this is Thy Yad; that Thou, Hashem , hast done it."
Tehillim,109,28,"Let them make kelalah (curse) , but do Thou make brocha; when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let Thy eved rejoice."
Tehillim,109,29,"Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own shame, as with a me'il (cloak)."
Tehillim,109,30,"I will greatly praise Hashem with my mouth; and, I will praise Him among the multitude."
Tehillim,109,31,"For He shall stand at the yamin (right hand) of the evyon (needy) , to save him from those that judge with condemnation his nefesh."
Tehillim,110,1," Hashem said unto Adoni, Sit thou at My right hand, until I make thine enemies a footstool for thy feet."
Tehillim,110,2, Hashem shall stretch forth the rod of thy might out of Tziyon; rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.
Tehillim,110,3,"Thy people, willing in the Day of thy Army, will be arrayed in the splendor of kodesh (holiness) ; from the womb of the dawn, cometh to thee thy young men as the tal (dew)."
Tehillim,110,4," Hashem hath sworn, and will not relent, Thou art a kohen l'olam al divrati Malki-Tzedek (kohen forever in respect to the order of Malki-Tzedek);"
Tehillim,110,5,Adonoi at thy right hand shall dash melachim (kings) in pieces in the Yom Afo (Day of His Wrath).

Tehillim,115,2,"Why should the Goyim say, Where is now their Elohim?"
Tehillim,115,3,But Eloheinu is in Shomayim; He hath done whatsoever He hath pleased.
Tehillim,115,4,"Their atzabim (idols) are kesef and zahav, the ma'aseh (work) of the hands of adam."
Tehillim,115,5,"Peh (mouth) they have, but they speak not; einayim (eyes) have they, but they see not;"
Tehillim,115,6,"Oznayim (ears) they have, but they hear not; af (nose) have they, but they smell not;"
Tehillim,115,7,"They have hands, but they handle not; raglayim (feet) have they, but they walk not; neither speak they through their garon (throat)."

Tehillim,118,6, Hashem is on my side; I will not fear; what can adam do unto me?
Tehillim,118,7, Hashem taketh my part through them that help me; therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.
Tehillim,118,8,It is better to trust in Hashem than to put confidence in adam.
Tehillim,118,9,It is better to trust in Hashem than to put confidence in nedivim (nobles).
Tehillim,118,10,All Goyim surrounded me; but in the Shem Hashem will I cut them off.
Tehillim,118,11,"They surrounded me; yes, they compassed me about; but in the Shem Hashem I will cut them off."
Tehillim,118,12,They compassed me about like devorim (bees) ; they are extinguished like the eish of kotzim (thorns) ; for in the Shem Hashem I will cut them off.
Tehillim,118,13,Thou hast hard pushed at me that I fell; but Hashem helped me.

Tehillim,118,17,"I shall not die, but live, and declare the ma'asim (works) of Hashem."
Tehillim,118,18, Hashem hath hard chastened me severely; but He hath not given me over unto mavet (death).
Tehillim,118,19,"Open to me the sha'arei tzedek; I will go through them, and I will praise Hashem;"
Tehillim,118,20,"This is the sha'ar of Hashem , into which the tzaddikim shall enter."

Tehillim,119,51,The zedim (arrogant ones) have had me greatly in derision; yet have I not turned aside from Thy torah.
Tehillim,119,52,"I remembered Thy mishpatim from of old, Hashem ; and have comforted myself."

Tehillim,119,59,"I thought on my drakhim, and turned my feet unto Thy edot (testimonies)."
Tehillim,119,60,"I made haste, and delayed not to be shomer over Thy mitzvot."
Tehillim,119,61,The ropes of the resha'im have bound me; but I have not forgotten Thy torah.
Tehillim,119,62,At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto Thee because of Thy righteous mishpatim.
Tehillim,119,63,"I am a chaver of all them that fear Thee, and of them that are shomer over Thy pikkudim."

Tehillim,119,67,Before I was afflicted I went astray; but now have I been shomer over Thy word.
Tehillim,119,68,"Thou art tov, and doest tov; teach me Thy chukkim."
Tehillim,119,69,The zedim (arrogant ones) have forged a sheker against me; but I will keep Thy pikkudim with my kol lev.
Tehillim,119,70,Their lev is callous like chelev; I delight in Thy torah.
Tehillim,119,71,It is tov for me that I have been afflicted l'ma'an (in order that) I might learn Thy chukkim.

Tehillim,119,80,"Let my lev be tamim (blameless, complete) in Thy chukkim; that I be not ashamed."
Tehillim,119,81,My nefesh fainteth for Thy salvation: but I hope in Thy davar.
Tehillim,119,82,"Mine eyes fail for Thy word saying, Mosai (when) wilt Thou comfort me?"
Tehillim,119,83,For I am become like a wineskin in the smoke; yet do I not forget Thy chukkim.
Tehillim,119,84,How many are the days of Thy eved? Mosai (when) wilt Thou execute mishpat on them that persecute me?
Tehillim,119,85,"The zedim (arrogant ones) have dug pits for me, which are not in accordance with Thy torah."
Tehillim,119,86,All Thy mitzvot are faithful: they persecute me wrongfully; help Thou me.
Tehillim,119,87,They had almost consumed me ba'aretz; but I forsook not Thy pikkudim.
Tehillim,119,88,Revive me after Thy chesed; so shall I be shomer over the edut of Thy mouth.
Tehillim,119,89,"Forever, Hashem , Thy Davar is settled and stands firm in Shomayim."
Tehillim,119,90,"Thy emunah (faithfulness) is to all generations: Thou hast established eretz, and it stands enduring."
Tehillim,119,91,They continue enduring to this day according to Thine mishpatim: for all things are Thy avadim.
Tehillim,119,92,"Unless Thy torah had been my delight, I should then have perished in mine oni."
Tehillim,119,93,I will never forget Thy pikkudim: for with them Thou hast revived me.
Tehillim,119,94,"I am Thine, save me: for I have sought out Thy pikkudim."
Tehillim,119,95,The resha'im have waited for me to destroy me: but I will think on Thy edot.
Tehillim,119,96,I have seen an end of all perfection: but Thy mitzvah is boundless.
Tehillim,119,97,O how I love Thy torah! It is my meditation kol hayom.
Tehillim,119,98,Thou through Thy mitzvot hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they are ever with me.
Tehillim,119,99,I have more understanding than every melamed of mine: for Thy edot are my meditation.
Tehillim,119,100,"I understand more than the zekenim, for I keep Thy pikkudim."
Tehillim,119,101,"I have refrained my feet from every orakh rah, in order that I might be shomer over Thy Devar."
Tehillim,119,102,I have not departed from Thy mishpatim: for Thou hast taught me.
Tehillim,119,103,How sweet are Thy words unto my palate! Sweeter than devash to my mouth!
Tehillim,119,104,Through Thy pikkudim I get understanding: therefore I hate every orakh sheker.
Tehillim,119,105,"Thy word is a ner unto my feet, ohr unto my path."
Tehillim,119,106,"I have sworn a shevuah, and I will perform it, that I will keep Thy righteous mishpatim."
Tehillim,119,107,"I am afflicted very much: revive me, Hashem , according unto Thy word."
Tehillim,119,108,"Accept the nidvot of my mouth, O Hashem , and teach me Thy mishpatim."
Tehillim,119,109,My nefesh is continually in my yad: yet do I not forget Thy torah.
Tehillim,119,110,The resha'im have laid a pach for me: yet I erred not from Thy pikkudim.
Tehillim,119,111,Thy edot have I taken as a heritage forever: for they are the sasson lev of me.
Tehillim,119,112,"I have inclined mine lev to perform Thy chukkim forever, even unto the end."
Tehillim,119,113,I hate the double-minded: but Thy torah do I love.
Tehillim,119,114,Thou art my seter (hiding place) and my mogen: I hope in Thy Devar.
Tehillim,119,115,"Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the mitzvot of Elohai."
Tehillim,119,116,"Uphold me according unto Thy imrah, that I may live: and let me not be ashamed from my hope."
Tehillim,119,117,"Hold Thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect unto Thy chukkim continually."
Tehillim,119,118,Thou hast rejected all them that err from Thy chukkim: for their deceitfulness is sheker (falsehood).
Tehillim,119,119,Thou puttest away all resha'im of eretz like dross; therefore I love Thy edot.
Tehillim,119,120,My basar trembleth for fear of Thee; and I am afraid of Thy mishpatim.
Tehillim,119,121,I have done mishpat and tzedek; leave me not to mine oppressors.
Tehillim,119,122,Be surety for Thy eved for good; let not the zedim (arrogant ones) oppress me.
Tehillim,119,123,"Mine eyes fail for Thy Yeshu'ah (salvation) , and for the word of Thy tzedakah."
Tehillim,119,124,"Deal with Thy eved according unto Thy chesed, and teach me Thy chukkim."
Tehillim,119,125,"I am Thy eved; give me understanding, that I may know Thy edot (testimonies)."
Tehillim,119,126,"It is time for Thee, Hashem , to work; for they have made void Thy torah."
Tehillim,119,127,"Therefore I love Thy mitzvot above zahav; yes, above fine gold."
Tehillim,119,128,Therefore I esteem right all Thy pikkudim concerning all things; and I hate every orakh sheker.
Tehillim,119,129,Thy edot (testimonies) are wonderful; therefore doth my nefesh keep them.
Tehillim,119,130,"The petach (entrance, doorway) of Thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple."
Tehillim,119,131,"I opened my mouth, and panted; for I longed for Thy mitzvot."
Tehillim,119,132,"Look Thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as Thy manner is unto those that love Shimcha."
Tehillim,119,133,Order my footsteps in Thy imrah; and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.
Tehillim,119,134,Redeem me from the oppression of adam; so will I keep Thy pikkudim.
Tehillim,119,135,Make Thy face to shine upon Thy eved; and teach me Thy chukkim.
Tehillim,119,136,"Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, for they are not shomer over Thy torah."
Tehillim,119,137,"Righteous art Thou, Hashem , and yashar are Thy mishpatim."
Tehillim,119,138,Thy edot (testimonies) that Thou hast commanded are tzedek and emunah me'od (very faithful).
Tehillim,119,139,"My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten Thy devarim."
Tehillim,119,140,Thy word is very tested; therefore Thy eved loveth it.
Tehillim,119,141,I am small and despised; yet do not I forget Thy pikkudim.
Tehillim,119,142,"Thy tzedakah is tzedek l'olam, and Thy torah emes."
Tehillim,119,143,Tzoros and anguish have taken hold on me; yet Thy mitzvot are my delight.
Tehillim,119,144,"The tzedek of Thy edot is l'olam; give me understanding, and I shall live."
Tehillim,119,145,"I cried with my kol lev; hear me, Hashem ; I will keep Thy chukkim."
Tehillim,119,146,"I cried unto Thee; save me, and I shall be shomer over Thy edot (testimonies)."
Tehillim,119,147,"I rose before the dawn, and cried out for help; I hoped in Thy Davar."
Tehillim,119,148,"Mine eyes are awake through the ashmurot (night watches) , that I might meditate on Thy word."
Tehillim,119,149,"Hear my voice according unto Thy chesed; Hashem , revive me according to Thy mishpat."
Tehillim,119,150,They draw near that follow after wicked schemes; they are far from Thy torah.
Tehillim,119,151,"Thou art karov (near), Hashem ; and all Thy mitzvot are emes."
Tehillim,119,152,"Concerning Thy edot (testimonies) , I have known of old that Thou hast founded them forever."
Tehillim,119,153,"Consider mine oni (affliction) , and deliver me; for I do not forget Thy torah."
Tehillim,119,154,Plead my cause; for me make go'el redemption; revive me according to Thy word.
Tehillim,119,155,"Yeshu'ah (salvation) is far from the resha'im, for they seek not Thy chukkim."
Tehillim,119,156,"Great are Thy rachamim, Hashem ; revive me according to Thy mishpatim."
Tehillim,119,157,Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet do I not turn aside from Thy edot.
Tehillim,119,158,"I beheld the bogedim, and was grieved because they were not shomer over Thy word."
Tehillim,119,159,"Consider how I love Thy pikkudim; revive me, Hashem , according to Thy chesed."
Tehillim,119,160,Thy word is emes from the beginning; and every one of Thy righteous mishpatim endureth forever.
Tehillim,119,161,Sarim (princes) have persecuted me without a cause; but my lev standeth in awe of Thy Davar.
Tehillim,119,162,"I rejoice at Thy imrah (word) , as one that findeth great plunder."
Tehillim,119,163,I hate and abhor sheker; but Thy torah do I love.
Tehillim,119,164,Shevah times a day do I praise Thee because of Thy righteous mishpatim.
Tehillim,119,165,Great shalom have they which love Thy torah; nothing shall cause them to stumble.
Tehillim,119,166," Hashem , I have hoped for Thy Yeshu'ah (salvation) , and do Thy mitzvot."
Tehillim,119,167,My nefesh is shomer over Thy edot (testimonies) ; and I love them exceedingly.
Tehillim,119,168,I have kept Thy pikkudim and Thy edot; for all my ways are before Thee.
Tehillim,119,169,"Let my cry come near before Thee, Hashem ; give me understanding according to Thy Davar."
Tehillim,119,170,Let my techinnah come before Thee; deliver me according to Thy word.
Tehillim,119,171,"My lips shall utter tehillah, when Thou hast taught me Thy chukkot."
Tehillim,119,172,My leshon shall speak of Thy word; for all Thy mitzvot are tzedek.
Tehillim,119,173,Let Thine Yad help me; for I have chosen Thy pikkudim.
Tehillim,119,174,"I have longed for Thy Yeshu'ah (salvation), Hashem ; and Thy torah is my delight."
Tehillim,119,175,"Let my nefesh live, and it shall praise Thee; and let Thy mishpatim sustain me."
Tehillim,119,176,I have gone astray like a seh oved (lost sheep) ; seek Thy eved; for I do not forget Thy mitzvot.
Tehillim,120,1,"In my tzoros I cried unto Hashem , and He heard me."
Tehillim,120,2,"Save my nefesh, Hashem , from sefat sheker (lying lips) , and from lashon remiyyah (a tongue of deceit)."
Tehillim,120,3,"What shall be given unto thee? Or what shall be done unto thee, thou lashon remiyyah?"
Tehillim,120,4,"Sharp khitzim (arrows) of the gibbor, with burning (charcoal) coals of the broom plant."
Tehillim,120,5,"Woe is me, that I sojourn in Meshech, that I dwell in the ohalim of Kedar!"
Tehillim,120,6,My nefesh hath long dwelt with him that hateth shalom.
Tehillim,120,7,"I am for shalom; but when I speak, they are for milchamah (war)."
Tehillim,121,1,"I will lift up mine eyes unto the harim (hills) , from whence cometh ezri (my help)."
Tehillim,121,2,"Ezri (my help) cometh from Hashem , Oseh Shomayim va'Aretz."
Tehillim,121,3,He will not allow thy regel to slip; He that is shomer over thee will not slumber.
Tehillim,121,4,"Hinei, He that is shomer over Yisroel shall neither slumber nor sleep."
Tehillim,121,5, Hashem is the One shomer over thee; Hashem is thy shade upon thy right hand.
Tehillim,121,6,"The shemesh shall not strike thee by day, nor the yarei'ach by night."
Tehillim,121,7, Hashem shall preserve thee from kol rah; He shall preserve thy nefesh.
Tehillim,121,8," Hashem shall be shomer over thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even v'ad olam."
Tehillim,122,1,"I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the Bais Hashem."
Tehillim,122,2,"Our feet shall stand within thy she'arim, O Yerushalayim."
Tehillim,122,3,Yerushalayim is built as an Ir bound firmly together;
Tehillim,122,4,"That is where the Shevatim (tribes) go up, the Shivtei Hashem , according to the edut l'Yisroel (the statute to Yisroel) , to give thanks unto the Shem of Hashem."
Tehillim,122,5,"For there are set kise'ot l'mishpat (thrones of judgment) , the kise'ot of the Bais Dovid."
Tehillim,122,6,Sha'alu shalom Yerushalayim (pray for the peace of Jerusalem) ; they shall prosper that love thee.
Tehillim,122,7,"Shalom be within thy wall, and security within thy citadels."
Tehillim,122,8,"L'ma'an (for the sake of) my achim and companions, I will now say, Shalom be within thee."
Tehillim,122,9,L'ma'an the Bais Hashem Eloheinu I will seek thy tov.
Tehillim,123,1,"Unto Thee lift I up mine eyes, O Thou that dwellest in Shomayim."
Tehillim,123,2,"Hinei, as the eyes of avadim look unto the yad adoneihem, and as the eyes of a shifchah (maiden) unto the yad of her gevirah; so our eyes wait upon Hashem Eloheinu, until He have channun (favor, grace) upon us."
Tehillim,123,3,"Channenu Hashem , channenu; for we are more than sated with buz (contempt)."
Tehillim,123,4,"Nafsheinu (our nefesh) is more than sated with the scorn of those that are at ease, and with the buz (contempt) of the g'eiyonim (proud ones, arrogant ones)."
Tehillim,124,1,"If it had not been Hashem Who was lanu (for us, on our side) , now may Yisroel say;"
Tehillim,124,2,"If it had not been Hashem Who was lanu, when adam (man) rose up against us;"
Tehillim,124,3,Then they had swallowed us up chayyim (alive) ; when their wrath was kindled against us;
Tehillim,124,4,"Then the mayim would have overwhelmed us, the torrent would have swept over nafsheinu (our nefesh);"
Tehillim,124,5,Then the mayim hazedonim (treacherous waters) would have swept over nafsheinu (our nefesh).
Tehillim,124,6,"Baruch Hashem , Who hath not given us up as a prey to their shinayim (teeth)."
Tehillim,124,7,"Nafsheinu (our nefesh) is escaped as a tzippor (bird) out of the pach (snare of the fowlers) ; the pach is broken, and we are escaped."
Tehillim,124,8,Ezreinu (our help) B'Shem Hashem Oseh Shomayim vaAretz.
Tehillim,125,1,"They that trust in Hashem shall be as Mt Tziyon, which is immoveable, and abideth l'olam."
Tehillim,125,2,"As harim (the mountains) surround Yerushalayim, so Hashem surrounds His people from henceforth v'ad olam (and to forever)."
Tehillim,125,3,"For the shevet (scepter) of the resha shall not rest upon the goral (allotment, property) of the tzaddikim; lest the tzaddikim put forth their hands unto iniquity."
Tehillim,125,4,"Do good, Hashem , unto the tovim, and to them that are upright in their hearts."
Tehillim,125,5,"As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, Hashem shall turn them away with the workers of iniquity; but shalom shall be upon Yisroel."
Tehillim,126,1,"When Hashem brought the return of the captivity of Tziyon, we were like the cholemim (them that dream)."
Tehillim,126,2,"Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and leshoneinu (our tongue) with rinnah (joyful song) ; then said they among the Goyim, Hashem hath done great things for them."
Tehillim,126,3, Hashem hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.
Tehillim,126,4,"Return our captivity and restore our fortunes, Hashem , like torrents in the Negev."
Tehillim,126,5,They that sow in dimah (tears) shall reap in rinnah (joyful song).
Tehillim,126,6,"He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing meshek hazara (seed to be sown) shall doubtless come again with rinnah, bearing his alummot (sheaves)."
Tehillim,127,1,"Except Hashem build the bais, they that build it labor in vain; except Hashem is shomer over the city, the shomair (watchman) stands guard in vain."
Tehillim,127,2,"It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the lechem ha'atzavim (bread of toils) ; for so He giveth his beloved sleep."
Tehillim,127,3,"Hinei, banim are nachalat Hashem ; and the p'ri habeten is a zachar (reward)."
Tehillim,127,4,As khitzim (arrows) are in the yad of a gibbor; so are bnei haneurim (children born in oneʼs youth).
Tehillim,127,5,"Ashrei hagever that hath his quiver full of them; they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the oyevim basha'ar (enemy at the gate)."
Tehillim,128,1,Ashrei kol yerei (fearers of) Hashem ; that walketh in His drakhim.
Tehillim,128,2,"For thou shalt eat the labor of thine hands; happy shalt thou be, and it shall be tov with thee."
Tehillim,128,3,Thy isha shall be as a fruitful gefen inside thine bais; thy banim like olive shoots around thy shulchan.
Tehillim,128,4,"Hinei, thus shall the gever be blessed that feareth Hashem."
Tehillim,128,5, Hashem shall bless thee out of Tziyon; and thou shalt see the tov of Yerushalayim all the days of thy life.
Tehillim,128,6,"Yea, thou shalt see thy bnei banim, and shalom upon Yisroel."
Tehillim,129,1,"Many a time have they afflicted me from my ne'ur, may Yisroel now say;"
Tehillim,129,2,Many a time have they afflicted me from my ne'ur (youth) ; yet they have not prevailed against me.
Tehillim,129,3,The choreshim (plowers) plowed upon my back; they made long their furrows.
Tehillim,129,4, Hashem is tzaddik; He hath cut asunder the cords of the resha'im.
Tehillim,129,5,Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Tziyon.
Tehillim,129,6,"Let them be as the khatzir (grass) upon the housetops, which withereth before it groweth up;"
Tehillim,129,7,"With it the kotzer (reaper) filleth not his yad; nor he that gathereth sheaves, his bosom."
Tehillim,129,8,"Neither do they which go by say, Birkat Hashem be upon you; we bless you b'Shem Hashem."
Tehillim,130,1,"Out of the depths have I cried unto Thee, Hashem."
Tehillim,130,2,"Adonoi, hear my voice; let Thine ears be attentive to the voice of my techinnot (supplications)."
Tehillim,130,3,"If Thou, Hashem , shouldest record iniquities, Adonoi, who could stand?"
Tehillim,130,4,"But there is selichah (forgiveness) with Thee; therefore, Thou art feared."
Tehillim,130,5,"I wait for Hashem , my nefesh doth wait, and in His Devar do I hope."
Tehillim,130,6,"My nefesh waiteth for Adonoi more than the shomrim that watch for the boker; I say, more than the shomrim that watch for the boker."
Tehillim,130,7,"Let Yisroel hope in Hashem ; for with Hashem there is chesed, and with Him is plenteous pedut (redemption)."
Tehillim,130,8,And He shall redeem Yisroel from all his iniquities.
Tehillim,131,1," Hashem , my lev is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty; neither do I exercise myself in gedolot, or in things too high for me."
Tehillim,131,2,"Surely I have stilled and quieted my nefesh, as a child that is weaned of immo; my nefesh is even as a weaned child."
Tehillim,131,3,Let Yisroel hope in Hashem from henceforth and ad olam.
Tehillim,132,1," Hashem , remember Dovid, and all his afflictions;"
Tehillim,132,2,"How he swore unto Hashem , and vowed unto Avir Ya'akov (the Mighty One of Ya'akov);"
Tehillim,132,3,"Surely I will not come into the ohel of my bais, nor go up into my bed;"
Tehillim,132,4,"I will not give sleep to mine eyes, nor tenumah (slumber) to mine eyelids,"
Tehillim,132,5,"Until I find a makom (place) for Hashem , even mishkanot for the Avir Ya'akov."
Tehillim,132,6,"Hinei, we heard of it at Ephratah; we found it in the sedei Ya'ar (fields of Ya'ar)."
Tehillim,132,7,We will go into His mishkanot; we will worship at the hadom (footstool) of His raglayim.
Tehillim,132,8,"Arise, Hashem , into Thy menuchah (resting place) ; Thou, and the Aron of Thy oz (might)."
Tehillim,132,9,Let Thy Kohanim be clothed with tzedek; and let Thy chasidim sing for joy.
Tehillim,132,10,"For the sake of Dovid Thy Eved, do not turn away the face of Thine Moshiach."
Tehillim,132,11, Hashem hath sworn in emes unto Dovid; He will not turn from His oath: Of the p'ri (fruit) of thy beten (body) will I set upon thy kisse (throne).
Tehillim,132,12,"If thy Banim are shomer over My Brit and My Edot that I shall teach them, their Banim shall also sit upon thy kisse adei-ad (forevermore)."
Tehillim,132,13,For Hashem hath chosen Tziyon; He hath desired her for His moshav.
Tehillim,132,14,This is My menuchah (resting place) adei-ad (forever) ; here will I dwell; for I have desired her.
Tehillim,132,15,I will place a bountiful brocha on her provision; I will satisfy her poor with lechem.
Tehillim,132,16,I will also clothe her Kohanim with Yesha (salvation) ; and her chasidim shall sing aloud for joy.
Tehillim,132,17,There atzmi'ach (I will make sprout) the Keren of Dovid; I have ordained a ner (lamp) for My Moshiach.
Tehillim,132,18,His oyevim will I clothe with boshet (shame) ; but upon him shall his nezer (crown) be resplendent.
Tehillim,133,1,"Hinei, mah tov umah na'im shevet achim gahm yachad (how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity)!"
Tehillim,133,2,"It is like the precious shemen upon the rosh, that ran down upon the beard, even Aharonʼs beard; that went down to the collar of his robes;"
Tehillim,133,3,"As the tal of Chermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Tziyon; for there Hashem commanded the brocha, even Chayyim Ad Olam."
Tehillim,134,1,"Hinei, barakhu Hashem , kol avedei Hashem , which balailah stand in the Bais Hashem."
Tehillim,134,2,"Lift up your hands in the Kodesh, and barakhu Hashem."
Tehillim,134,3,"Yevarekhecha Hashem from Tziyon, Oseh Shomayim va'Aretz (the Maker of Heaven and Earth)."
Tehillim,135,1,"Praise Hashem . Halelu Shem Hashem ; Halelu, O ye avadim of Hashem."
Tehillim,135,2,"Ye that stand ministering in the Beis Hashem , in the khatzerot Beis Eloheinu."
Tehillim,135,3,"Praise Hashem ; for Hashem is tov; sing praise unto Shmo; for it is na'im (lovely, pleasing)."
Tehillim,135,4,"For Hashem hath chosen Ya'akov unto Himself, and Yisroel for His segullah (peculiar treasure)."
Tehillim,135,5,"For I know that Hashem is gadol, and that Adoneinu is above kol elohim."
Tehillim,135,6,"Whatsoever Hashem pleases, that He does in Shomayim, and in HaAretz, in HaYam, and kol tehomot."
Tehillim,135,7,He causeth the clouds to ascend at the end of HaAretz; He maketh lightning for the matar (rain) ; He bringeth the ruach out of His otzarot.
Tehillim,135,8,"Who struck down the Bechorei Mitzrayim, both of adam and behemah."
Tehillim,135,9,"Who sent otot and mofetim into the midst of thee, O Mitzrayim, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his avadim."
Tehillim,135,10,"Who struck down Goyim rabbim, and slaughtered melachim atzumim (powerful kings);"
Tehillim,135,11,"Sichon Melech HaEmori, and Og Melech HaBashan, and all the mamlechot Kena'an;"
Tehillim,135,12,"And gave their land for a nachalah, an inheritance unto Yisroel Amo (His people)."
Tehillim,135,13,"Thy Shem, Hashem , endureth l'olam; and Thy remembrance, Hashem , l'dor vador."
Tehillim,135,14,For Hashem will vindicate His people; He will have compassion on His avadim.
Tehillim,135,15,"The idols of the Goyim are kesef and zahav, the ma'aseh yedei adam."
Tehillim,135,16,"They have mouths, but they speak not; einayim have they, but they see not;"
Tehillim,135,17,"They have oznayim, but they hear not; neither is there any ruach in their mouths."
Tehillim,135,18,They that oseihem (make them) will be like them; so is every one that trusteth in them.
Tehillim,135,19,"Barakhu Hashem , O Bais Yisroel; barakhu Hashem , O Bais Aharon;"
Tehillim,135,20,"Barakhu Hashem , O Bais HaLevi; ye that fear Hashem , barakhu Hashem."
Tehillim,135,21,"Baruch Hashem out of Tziyon, which dwelleth at Yerushalayim. Praise Hashem."
Tehillim,136,1,O give thanks unto Hashem ; for He is tov; ki l'olam chasdo (His chesed indures forever).
Tehillim,136,2,O give thanks unto Elohei HaElohim; ki l'olam chasdo.
Tehillim,136,3,O give thanks to Adonei HaAdonim; ki l'olam chasdo.
Tehillim,136,4,To Him Who alone doeth nifla'ot gedolot; ki l'olam chasdo.
Tehillim,136,5,To Him that by tevunah (understanding) made HaShomayim; ki l'olam chasdo.
Tehillim,136,6,To Him that stretched out ha'aretz above the mayim; ki l'olam chasdo.
Tehillim,136,7,To Him that made ohrim gedolim (great lights) ; ki l'olam chasdo.
Tehillim,136,8,The shemesh to rule by yom; ki l'olam chasdo.
Tehillim,136,9,The yarei'ach and kokhavim to rule by lailah; ki l'olam chasdo.
Tehillim,136,10,To Him that struck down Mitzrayim in their bechorot (firstborn) ; ki l'olam chasdo.
Tehillim,136,11,And brought out Yisroel from among them; ki l'olam chasdo.
Tehillim,136,12,"With a yad chazakah, and with a stretched out zero'a; ki l'olam chasdo."
Tehillim,136,13,To Him Who divided asunder Yam Suf; ki l'olam chasdo.
Tehillim,136,14,And made Yisroel to pass through the midst of it; ki l'olam chasdo.
Tehillim,136,15,But overthrew Pharaoh and his army in the Yam Suf; ki l'olam chasdo.
Tehillim,136,16,To Him Who led His people through the midbar; ki l'olam chasdo.
Tehillim,136,17,To Him Who struck down melachim gedolim; ki l'olam chasdo.
Tehillim,136,18,And slaughtered mighty melachim; ki l'olam chasdo.
Tehillim,136,19,Sichon Melech HaEmori; ki l'olam chasdo.
Tehillim,136,20,And Og Melech HaBashan; ki l'olam chasdo.
Tehillim,136,21,And gave their land for a nachalah; ki l'olam chasdo.
Tehillim,136,22,Even a nachalah unto Yisroel His eved; ki l'olam chasdo.
Tehillim,136,23,Who remembered us in our low estate; ki l'olam chasdo.
Tehillim,136,24,And hath released us from our enemies; ki l'olam chasdo.
Tehillim,136,25,Who giveth lechem to kol basar; ki l'olam chasdo.
Tehillim,136,26,O give thanks unto the G-d of Shomayim; ki l'olam chasdo.
Tehillim,137,1,"By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yes, we wept, when we remembered Tziyon."
Tehillim,137,2,We hung up our kinnorot (lyres) upon the willows in the midst thereof.
Tehillim,137,3,"For there they that carried us away captive required of us a shir (song) ; and they that tormented us required of us simchah, saying, Sing us one of the Shir Tziyon."
Tehillim,137,4,How shall we sing Shir Hashem in an admat nekhar (foreign land).
Tehillim,137,5,"If I forget thee, O Yerushalayim, let my yamin (right hand) forget."
Tehillim,137,6,"If I do not remember thee, let my leshon cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Yerushalayim above my rosh simchah (chief joy)."
Tehillim,137,7,"Remember, Hashem , the Bnei Edom in the Yom Yerushalayim; who said, Raze it, raze it, even to the yesod (foundation) thereof."
Tehillim,137,8,"O Bat Bavel, who art to be destroyed, ashrei shall he be, that repayeth thee the gemul thou hast done to us."
Tehillim,137,9,"Ashrei shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy olalim against the sela."
Tehillim,138,1,I will thank Thee with my whole lev; before the elohim will I sing praise unto Thee.
Tehillim,138,2,"I will worship toward Thy Heikhal Kodesh, and praise Shmecha (Thy Name) for Thy chesed and for Thy emes; for Thou hast magnified Thy Word above Kol Shimcha (all Thy Name)."
Tehillim,138,3,"In the day when I called out, Thou answeredst me, and madest me bold with oz (strength) in my nefesh."
Tehillim,138,4,"Kol Malchei Aretz shall praise Thee, Hashem , when they hear the words of Thy mouth."
Tehillim,138,5,"Yes, they shall sing of the Darkhei Hashem ; for gadol is the Kavod Hashem."
Tehillim,138,6,"Though Hashem be on high, yet He looks upon the lowly; but the proud He knoweth from afar."
Tehillim,138,7,"Though I walk in the midst of tzoros, Thou wilt preserve me alive; Thou shalt stretch forth Thine yad against the wrath of mine enemies, and Thy Yamin (Right Hand) shall save me."
Tehillim,138,8," Hashem will fulfill that which concerneth me; Thy chesed, O Hashem , endureth l'olam; forsake not the works of Thine own yadayim."
Tehillim,139,1," Hashem , Thou hast searched me, and known me."
Tehillim,139,2,"Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, Thou hast binah of my thought from afar off."
Tehillim,139,3,"Thou comprehendeth my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my drakhim."
Tehillim,139,4,"For there is not a milah (word) in my leshon, but, lo, Hashem , Thou knowest it altogether."
Tehillim,139,5,"Thou hast enclosed me achor (behind) and kedem (before) , and laid Thine hand upon me."
Tehillim,139,6,"Such da'as is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it."
Tehillim,139,7,To where can I go from Thy Ruach? Or to where shall I flee from Thy presence?
Tehillim,139,8,"If I ascend up into Shomayim, Thou art there; if I make my bed in Sheol, hinei, Thou art there."
Tehillim,139,9,"If I take the wings of the shachar (dawn) , and dwell in the uttermost acharit yam (the extreme end of the sea);"
Tehillim,139,10,"Even there shall Thy yad lead me, and Thy yamin shall hold me."
Tehillim,139,11,"If I say, Surely the choshech shall cover me, even the lailah shall be ohr about me."
Tehillim,139,12,Even the choshech is not dark to Thee; but the lailah shineth as the yom; the choshech and the ohr are both alike to Thee.
Tehillim,139,13,For Thou hast possessed my inmost being; Thou didst interweave me in the beten immi.
Tehillim,139,14,I will praise Thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; marvellous are Thy ma'asim; and that my nefesh knoweth very well.
Tehillim,139,15,"My atzamim (bones, frame) were not hid from Thee, when I was made beseter (in secret) , and skillfully wrought in the depths of the Eretz."
Tehillim,139,16,"Thine eyes did see my golem (embryo) , yet being unformed; and in Thy Sefer (Book) all the yamim (days) ordained for me were written down, when as yet there were none of them."
Tehillim,139,17,"How precious also are Thy thoughts unto me, O El! How great is the sum of them!"
Tehillim,139,18,"If I should count them, they are more in number than the chol (sand) ; when I awake, I am still with Thee."
Tehillim,139,19,"Surely Thou wilt slay the rasha, O Eloah; depart from me therefore, ye anshei damim (bloodthirsty men)."
Tehillim,139,20,"For they speak of Thee craftily, and it is taken lashav by Thy enemies."
Tehillim,139,21,"Should not I hate them, Hashem , that hate Thee? And am not I to be at odds with those that rise up against Thee?"
Tehillim,139,22,I abhor them with complete sinah; I count them mine enemies.
Tehillim,139,23,"Search me, O El, and know my levav; test me, and know my thoughts;"
Tehillim,139,24,"And see if there be any derech otzev (torturous crooked road) in me, and lead me in the Derech Olam."
Tehillim,140,1,"Deliver me, Hashem , from adam rah; preserve me from ish chamasim (violent men);"
Tehillim,140,2,Which plan ra'ot (evils) in their lev; kol yom they incite milchamot (wars).
Tehillim,140,3,They have sharpened their leshonot like a nachash; the venom of a spider is under their sfatayim (lips) . Selah
Tehillim,140,4,"Be shomer over me, Hashem , and keep me from the hands of the rashah; protect me from ish chamasim, whose scheme is to cause my steps to trip."
Tehillim,140,5,"The ge'im (proud, arrogant ones) have hid a pach for me, and chavalim (cords, ropes) ; they have spread a reshet (net) close by the path; they have set mokshim (traps) for me. Selah"
Tehillim,140,6,"I said unto Hashem , Thou art Eli; hear the kol tachanunai (voice of my supplications), Hashem."
Tehillim,140,7," Hashem Adonoi, Oz Yeshu'ati (strength of my salvation) , Thou hast covered my rosh in the Yom Neshek (Day of Arms, Day of Battle)."
Tehillim,140,8,"Grant not, Hashem , the desires of the rashah; let not his plot succeed; lest they exalt themselves. Selah"
Tehillim,140,9,"As for the rosh of those that surround me, let the amal (trouble) of their own sfatayim (lips) cover them."
Tehillim,140,10,"Let burning coals fall upon them; let them be cast into the eish; into mahamorot (watery pits) , that they rise not up again."
Tehillim,140,11,"Let not an ish lashon (idle talker, slanderer) be established in ha'aretz; rah shall hunt down the ish chamas to overthrow him."
Tehillim,140,12,"I know that Hashem will maintain the din oni (cause of the poor) , and the mishpat evyonim (the right of the needy)."
Tehillim,140,13,Surely the tzaddikim shall give thanks unto Thy Shem; the upright shall dwell in Thy presence.
Tehillim,141,1," Hashem , I cry unto Thee; make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto Thee."
Tehillim,141,2,Let my tefillah be set forth before Thee like ketoret; and the lifting up of my hands as the minchat erev.
Tehillim,141,3,"Be shomer, Hashem , over my mouth; guard the door of my lips."
Tehillim,141,4,"Let not my lev incline to any evil thing, to practice wicked works with men that work iniquity; and let me not eat of their dainties."
Tehillim,141,5,"Let the tzaddik strike me; it shall be chesed; and let him reprove me; it shall be shemen, which my rosh shall not refuse; for still shall my tefillah be against their evil deeds."
Tehillim,141,6,Their shofetim are overthrown in stony places; they hear my words; for they are pleasant.
Tehillim,141,7,"Atzameinu (our bones) are scattered at the mouth of Sheol, as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon ha'aretz."
Tehillim,141,8,"But mine eyes are unto Thee, Hashem Adonoi; in Thee do I take refuge; leave not my nefesh defenseless."
Tehillim,141,9,"Keep me from the pach (snare, trap) which they have laid for me, and the traps of the workers of iniquity."
Tehillim,141,10,"Let the resha'im fall into their own nets, while I escape safely."
Tehillim,142,1,I cried out unto Hashem with my voice; with my voice unto Hashem did I make my techinnah (supplication).
Tehillim,142,2,I poured out my complaint before Him; I showed before Him my tzoros.
Tehillim,142,3,"When my ruach became faint within me, then Thou had da'as of my path. In the way wherein I walked have they laid a pach (snare, hidden trap) for me."
Tehillim,142,4,"I looked on my right, and behold, there was no man that would know me; refuge failed me; no man cared for my nefesh."
Tehillim,142,5,"I cried unto Thee, Hashem ; I said, Thou art my refuge and my chelek (portion) in the Eretz HaChayyim."
Tehillim,142,6,Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low; save me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.
Tehillim,142,7,"Release my nefesh from prison, to praise Shemecha (Thy Name) ; the tzaddikim shall gather about me; for Thou shalt deal bountifully with me."
Tehillim,143,1,"Hear my tefillah, Hashem , give ear to my techinot (supplications) ; in Thy emunah answer me, and in Thy tzedakah."
Tehillim,143,2,And enter not into mishpat with Thy eved; for in Thy sight shall no man living be yitzadak (justified).
Tehillim,143,3,"For the oyev (enemy) hath persecuted my nefesh; he hath struck down my life to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in places of choshech (darkness) , like metei olam (those long dead)."
Tehillim,143,4,Therefore is my ruach become faint within me; my lev within me is desolate.
Tehillim,143,5,"I remember yamim mikedem (days of old) , I meditate on all Thy works; I muse on the ma'aseh (work) of Thy hands."
Tehillim,143,6,"I stretch forth my hands unto Thee; my nefesh thirsteth after Thee, like an eretz ayefah (a parched, thirsty land) . Selah"
Tehillim,143,7,"Hear me speedily, Hashem ; my ruach faileth; hide not Thy face from me, lest I be like those that go down into the bor (pit)."
Tehillim,143,8,Cause me to hear Thy chesed in the boker; for in Thee do I trust; cause me to know the Derech wherein I should walk; for I lift up my nefesh unto Thee.
Tehillim,143,9,"Save me, Hashem , from mine oyevim (enemies) ; I flee unto Thee to hide me."
Tehillim,143,10,Teach me to do Retzonecha (Thy will) ; for Thou art Elohai; may Thy Ruach Tov lead me on level ground.
Tehillim,143,11,"Revive me, Hashem , l'ma'an (for the sake of) Thy Shem (Name) ; in Thy tzedakah bring my nefesh out of tzoros."
Tehillim,143,12,"And in Thy chesed silence mine enemies, and destroy all them that oppress my nefesh; for I am Thy eved."
Tehillim,144,1,"Baruch Hashem my Tzur (rock) which teacheth my hands for war, and my fingers for milchamah (battle);"
Tehillim,144,2,"My Chesed, and my Metzudah (Fortress) ; my Stronghold, and my Deliverer; my Mogen, and He in Whom I take refuge; Who subdueth my people under me."
Tehillim,144,3," Hashem , what is adam, that Thou takest knowledge of him! Or the ben enosh, that Thou takest account of him!"
Tehillim,144,4,Adam is like hevel; his days are as a tzel that passeth away.
Tehillim,144,5,"Part Thy heavens, Hashem , and come down; touch the harim, and they shall smoke."
Tehillim,144,6,"Cast forth lightning, and scatter them; shoot Thine khitzim (arrows) , and destroy them."
Tehillim,144,7,"Send Thine Yad from above; rescue me, and deliver me out of mayim rabbim, from the yad Bnei Nekhar;"
Tehillim,144,8,"Whose mouth speaketh shav (lies) , and their right hand is a right hand of sheker."
Tehillim,144,9,"I will sing a shir chadash unto Thee, O Elohim; upon a nevel of ten strings will I make music unto Thee."
Tehillim,144,10,"It is He that giveth Teshu'ah (deliverance, salvation) unto melachim; Who delivereth Dovid His eved from the cherev ra'ah."
Tehillim,144,11,"Rescue me, and save me from the yad Bnei Nekhar, whose mouth speaketh shav (lies) and their right hand is a right yad of sheker;"
Tehillim,144,12,"In their youth, may baneinu (our sons) be like plants full grown; may benoteinu (our daughters) be like cornerstones, columns wrought for the Heikhal;"
Tehillim,144,13,"That our barns may be full, affording all manner of provision; that our tzon may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our meadows;"
Tehillim,144,14,That our oxen may be strong to labor; that there be no peretz (breach) nor golus; that there be no cry of anquish in our streets.
Tehillim,144,15,Ashrei are such people; Ashrei is the people that Hashem is Elohav. (Tehillah of Dovid).
Tehillim,145,1," [Alef] I will extol Thee, Elohai HaMelech; and I will bless Thy Shem l'olam va'ed."
Tehillim,145,2, [Beis] Kol yom will I bless Thee; and I will praise Thy Shem l'olam va'ed.

Tehillim,145,6, [Vav] And men shall speak of the power of Thy norot; and I will declare Thy greatness.
Tehillim,145,7," [Zayin] They shall utter the zekher (memory, recollection) of Thy rav tov and shall sing of Thy tzedakah."
Tehillim,145,8," [Chet] Channun (gracious) is Hashem , and full of compassion; erech apayim (slow to anger) , and of great chesed."

Tehillim,145,10," [Yod] All Thy ma'asim shall praise Thee, Hashem ; and Thy chasidim shall bless Thee."
Tehillim,145,11," [Khaf] They shall speak of the kavod of Thy Malchus, and tell of Thy gevurah;"

Tehillim,145,13," [Mem] Thy Malchus is a Malchus kol olamim, and Thy Memshelet for kol dor vador."
Tehillim,145,14," [Samekh] Hashem upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that are bowed down."
Tehillim,145,15, [Ayin] The eyes of all look to Thee; and Thou givest them their okhel (food) in its season.
