Shir Hashirim,1,1,"Shir HaShirim, which is Sh'lomoʼs."
Shir Hashirim,1,2,Let him kiss me with the neshikot (kisses) of his mouth; for better is dodecha (thy love) than yayin (wine).
Shir Hashirim,1,3,Tovim is the fragrance of thy shmanim (ointments) ; thy shem (name) is like shemen (ointment) poured forth; therefore do the alamot love thee.
Shir Hashirim,1,4,Draw me; so will we run after thee; the Melech hath brought me into his chadarim (chambers) ; we will be glad and rejoice in thee; we will extol dodecha (thy love) more than yayin; uprightly have they loved thee.
Shir Hashirim,1,5,"Shechorah (black, dark, sun-blackened) am I, yet lovely, O ye banot Yerushalayim, like the oholim (tents) of Kedar, like the curtains of Sh'lomo."
Shir Hashirim,1,6,"Let your eyes burn not into me because I am black, because the shemesh hath burned its eyes into me; bnei immi (my step-brothers) were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the kramim (vineyards) ; but mine own kerem (vineyard) have I not kept."
Shir Hashirim,1,7,"O tell me, thou whom my nefesh loveth, where feedest thou? Where makest thou thy flock to lie down at noon? For why should I be as one who veils herself among the edrei chaverecha (the flocks of thy chaverim, fellow companions)?"
Shir Hashirim,1,8,"If thou know not, O thou fairest among nashim, go thy way forth by the footprints of the tzon, and feed thy young goats beside the mishkenot haro'im (the tents of the shepherds)."
Shir Hashirim,1,9,"O my love, to a susah (mare) among the chariots of Pharaoh do I compare thee."

Shir Hashirim,1,12,"While the Melech is at his table, my spikenard perfume has yielded its fragrance."
Shir Hashirim,1,13,Dodi (my beloved) is to me a sachet of myrrh that lieth in my bosom.
Shir Hashirim,1,14,Dodi (my beloved) is to me as a cluster of henna blooms in the kramim (vineyards) of Ein-Gedi.
Shir Hashirim,1,15,"See, thou art yafeh (fair) , my love; see, thou art fair; thine eynayim are yonim (doves)."
Shir Hashirim,1,16,"See, thou art yafeh (handsome) , dodi (my beloved) , yea, na'im (pleasing) ; also our couch is verdant."
Shir Hashirim,1,17,"The beams of our bais are cedar, and our rafters are cypress."
Shir Hashirim,2,1,"I am the rose of Sharon, and the shoshan (lily) of the valleys."
Shir Hashirim,2,2,"As the shoshan (lily) among thorns, so is my love among the banot."
Shir Hashirim,2,3,"As the tapuach (apple tree) among the trees of the wood, so is dodi (my beloved) among the banim. Betzilloh (in his shade, shadow) chimmadti (I desire ), and his p'ri (fruit) is sweet to my taste."
Shir Hashirim,2,4,"He brought me to the Bais HaYayin, and his degel (standard, banner, flag) over me is ahavah."
Shir Hashirim,2,5,"Sustain me with cakes of raisins, comfort me with apples: ki cholat ahavah ani (for I am faint with ahavah, lovesick)."
Shir Hashirim,2,6,"His left hand is under my rosh, and his right hand doth embrace me."
Shir Hashirim,2,7,"I charge you, O ye banot Yerushalayim, by the gazelles, and by the deer of the sadeh, that ye arouse nor awake HaAhavah till it pleases."
Shir Hashirim,2,8,"Kol dodi (the voice of my beloved) ! Hinei, he cometh leaping upon the harim, bounding over the hills."
Shir Hashirim,2,9,"Dodi (my beloved) is like a gazelle or a young deer; hinei, he standeth behind our Kotel (Wall) ; he looketh forth at the chalonot (windows) , peering through the lattices."
Shir Hashirim,2,10,"Dodi (my beloved) spoke, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away."
Shir Hashirim,2,11,"For, hinei, the winter is past, the geshem (rain) is over and gone;"
Shir Hashirim,2,12,"The flowers appear on ha'aretz; the time of zemer (song, singing of birds) has come; and the voice of the turtledove is heard in Artzeinu (our Land);"
Shir Hashirim,2,13,"The te'enah (fig tree) putteth forth her early figs, and the vines with the tender grape give forth fragrance. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away."
Shir Hashirim,2,14,"O my yonah (dove) , that art in the clefts of the rock, in the seter (secret place) of the cliff, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is lovely."
Shir Hashirim,2,15,"Catch the shu'alim (foxes) , the shu'alim ketanim (little foxes) , that spoil the kramim (vines) ; for krameinu (our [blooming] vines) have tender grapes."
Shir Hashirim,2,16,"Dodi (my beloved) is mine, and I am his; he feedeth among the lilies."
Shir Hashirim,2,17,"Until HaYom (the day) break, and the shadows flee away, turn, dodi (my beloved) , and be thou like a gazelle or a young deer upon the hills of Beter."
Shir Hashirim,3,1,"In the nights on my bed I sought him whom my nefesh loveth; I sought him, but I found him not."
Shir Hashirim,3,2,"So I will rise then, and go about the city in the streets, and in the rechovot (open squares, places) ; I will seek him whom my nefesh loveth; I sought him, but found him not."
Shir Hashirim,3,3,"The shomrim (watchmen) that go about the city found me; to whom I said, Saw ye him whom my nefesh loveth?"
Shir Hashirim,3,4,"Scarcely had I passed from them, when I found him whom my nefesh loveth; I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into the bais immi (the house of my mother) , and into the cheder of her that conceived me."
Shir Hashirim,3,5,"I charge you, O ye banot Yerushalayim, by the gazelles, and by the deer of the sadeh, that ye arouse nor awake HaAhavah till it pleases."
Shir Hashirim,3,6,"Who is this that cometh out of the midbar like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense from all the fragrant powders of the rokhel (merchant)?"
Shir Hashirim,3,7,"Hinei, his conveyance, which is Sh'lomoʼs; threescore gibborim (valiant men) are around it, of the Gibborei Yisroel."
Shir Hashirim,3,8,"They all hold swords, being expert in milchamah (war) ; every man hath his cherev (sword) at his side against the pachad (terror, dread) of the nights."
Shir Hashirim,3,9,"HaMelech Sh'lomo made himself an appiryon (palanquin), of the wood of the Levanon."
Shir Hashirim,3,10,"He made the pillars thereof of kesef, the support thereof of zahav, the cushion of it of purple, the interior thereof being inlaid with Ahavah, by the banot Yerushalayim."
Shir Hashirim,3,11,"Come out, O ye banot Tziyon, and behold Sh'lomo HaMelech with the atarah (crown) wherewith his em crowned him in the Yom Chasunoh (day of his wedding) , and in the Yom Simchat Libo (day of the gladness of his heart)."
Shir Hashirim,4,1,"Behold, thou art yafeh, my love; behold, thou art yafeh; thine eyes are yonim (doves) behind your veil; thy hair is like an eder (flock) of goats descending from Mount Gil'ad."
Shir Hashirim,4,2,"Thy teeth are like an eder of sheep that are just shorn, coming up from washing; whereof every one is matched, and none is missing among them."
Shir Hashirim,4,3,"Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy mouth is naveh (lovely) ; thy temple is like a half-pomegranate within thy veil."
Shir Hashirim,4,4,"Thy tzavar (neck) is like the migdal Dovid girt with battlements, whereon there hang a thousand mogen, all the shields of Gibborim."
Shir Hashirim,4,5,"Thy two breasts are like two ofarim (fawns, young deer) that are twins, which graze among the lilies."
Shir Hashirim,4,6,"Until HaYom (the day) break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the har hamor (mountain of myrrh) , and to the hill of frankincense."

Shir Hashirim,4,8,"Come with me from the Levanon, my kallah (bride) , with me from the Levanon; come down from the heights of Amanah, from the top of Senir and Chermon, from the dens of the arayot (lions) , from the hills of the nemerim (leopards)."
Shir Hashirim,4,9,"Thou hast ravished my lev, my sister, my kallah; thou hast ravished my lev with one of thy glances, with one link of thy necklace."
Shir Hashirim,4,10,"How fair is thy love, my sister, my kallah! How much better is thy love than yayin! And the scent of thine perfumes than any spice!"
Shir Hashirim,4,11,"Thy lips, O my kallah, drip like the honeycomb; devash and cholov are under thy tongue; and the scent of thy garments is like the scent of the Levanon."
Shir Hashirim,4,12,"A gan (garden) locked is my sister, my kallah; a spring enclosed, a ma'ayan (fountain) sealed."
Shir Hashirim,4,13,"Thy plants are a pardeis (park, paradise) of pomegranates, with pleasant p'ri; henna with spikenard,"
Shir Hashirim,4,14,"Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with kol atzei levonah (all kinds of incense trees) ; myrrh and aloes, with all the finest spices:"
Shir Hashirim,4,15,"A na'yan (fountain) of gardens, a be'er (well) of mayim chayyim (well of living waters) , and streams from the Levanon."
Shir Hashirim,4,16,"Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south wind; blow upon my gan (garden) , that the fragrances thereof may flow out. Let dodi (my beloved) come into his gan (garden) , and let him taste its choice pri (fruits)."
Shir Hashirim,5,1,"I am come into my gan (garden) , my sister, my kallah; I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my devash (honey) ; I have drunk my yayin with my cholov (milk) : Eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, dodim."
Shir Hashirim,5,2,"I sleep, but my lev waketh: it is the voice of dodi (my beloved) that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my yonah (dove) tammati (my undefiled, my perfect one) ; for my head is filled with tal (dew) , and my hair with the drops of the lailah."
Shir Hashirim,5,3,"I have put off my kuttonet (kesones, chiton, robe) ; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?"
Shir Hashirim,5,4,"Dodi (my beloved) thrust his hand through the latch-opening, my heart began pounding for him."
Shir Hashirim,5,5,"I arose to open to dodi (my beloved) ; and my hands dripped with myrrh, and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the man'ul (lock, door bolt)."
Shir Hashirim,5,6,"I opened to dodi (my beloved) ; but dodi had withdrawn and gone; my nefesh departed when he spoke; I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer."
Shir Hashirim,5,7,"The shomrim (watchmen) that went about the city found me, they beat me, they wounded me; the shomrei hachomat took away my cloak from me."
Shir Hashirim,5,8,"I charge you, O banot Yerushalayim, if ye find dodi (my beloved) , what will ye tell him? Tell him shecholat ahavah ani (I am faint with ahavah, lovesick)."

Shir Hashirim,6,4,"Thou art yafeh, O my love, as Tirtzah, lovely as Yerushalayim, awe-inspiring as bannered troops on the march."
Shir Hashirim,6,5,"Turn away thine eyes from me, for they overwhelm me; thy hair is as an eder of goats that descend from Gil'ad."
Shir Hashirim,6,6,"Thy teeth are as an eder harechalim (flock of ewes) which go up from the washing, whereof every one is matched, and there is not one missing among them."
Shir Hashirim,6,7,As a half pomegranate is thy temple within thy veil.
Shir Hashirim,6,8,"There are threescore melakhot (queens) , and fourscore pilagshim (concubines) , and alamot (young unmarried virgins) without number."
Shir Hashirim,6,9,"My yonah (dove) , tammati (my perfect one, my undefiled) is unique; she is the only one of her em (mother) , she is the barah (choice one) of her that bore her. The banot saw her, they called her blessed; yea, the melakhot and the pilagshim praise her."
Shir Hashirim,6,10,"Who is she that looks forth like the shachar (dawn) , yafeh as the levanah (moon) , clear as the sun, and awe-inspiring as bannered troops on the march?"
Shir Hashirim,6,11,"I went down into the grove of nut trees to see the blossoms of the valley, and to see whether hagefen (the vine) flourished and the pomegranates bloomed."
Shir Hashirim,6,12,"Before I was aware, my nefesh lifted me up to the merkevot of ammi (my people) of one, a royal one."
Shir Hashirim,6,13,"Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may gaze upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the mecholat Machanayim (dance of the Machanayim)."
Shir Hashirim,7,1,"How beautiful are thy feet in sandals, O princeʼs daughter! Thy graceful legs are like jewels, ma'aseh yedei amon (the work of the hands of an artist)."
Shir Hashirim,7,2,"Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not wine: thy waist is like a mound of chittim (wheat) encircled by shoshanim (lilies)."
Shir Hashirim,7,3,Thy two breasts are like two fawns that are twins of a gazelle.
Shir Hashirim,7,4,"Thy tzavar (neck) is like a migdal of ivory; thine eyes like the pools of Cheshbon, by the sha'ar (gate) of Bat-Rabbim; thy nose is like the migdal of the Levanon which looketh toward Damascus."
Shir Hashirim,7,5,"Thine head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thine head like royal tapestry; Melech is held captive in its tresses."
Shir Hashirim,7,6,"How fair and how pleasant art thou, O Ahavah, for delights!"
Shir Hashirim,7,7,"This thy stature is like a tamar (palm tree) , and thy breasts eshkolot (clusters [of fruit])."
Shir Hashirim,7,8,"I said, I will climb up to the tamar, I will take hold of the branches thereof; now also thy breasts shall be as eshkelot hagefen (clusters of the vine) , and the scent of thy breath like apples;"
Shir Hashirim,7,9,"And the roof of thy mouth like the best yayin of dodi (my beloved) , that goeth down sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak."
Shir Hashirim,7,10,"I am my belovedʼs, and to me goeth forth his teshukah (desire)."
Shir Hashirim,7,11,"Come, dodi (my beloved) , let us go forth into the sadeh; let us lodge in the villages."
Shir Hashirim,7,12,"Let us get up early to the kramim (vineyards) ; let us see if the gefen budded, whether the tender grape appears, and the pomegranates bloom; there will I give thee my love."
Shir Hashirim,7,13,"The mandrakes send out their fragrance, and at our doors are all manner of pleasant fruits, chadashim (new ones) and yeshanim (old ones) , which I have stored up and kept for thee, O dodi (my beloved)."
Shir Hashirim,8,1,"O that thou were like my brother, that nursed the breasts of immi (my mother) ! Then, if I should find thee outside, I would kiss thee; yea, and no one would look down on me."
Shir Hashirim,8,2,"I would lead thee, and bring thee into bais immi. Thou wouldest instruct me; I would cause thee to drink of spiced yayin and the nectar of my pomegranate."
Shir Hashirim,8,3,"His left hand should be under my rosh, and his right hand embrace me."
Shir Hashirim,8,4,"I charge you, O banot Yerushalayim, that ye arouse nor awake HaAhavah (the Love) till it pleases."
Shir Hashirim,8,5,"Who is this that cometh up from the midbar, leaning upon her beloved? Under the tapuach (apple tree) I awakened thee; it was there thy em conceived thee; there she who brought thee forth conceived thee."
Shir Hashirim,8,6,"Set me as a chotam (seal) upon thine lev, as a chotam upon thine zero'a (arm) ; for ahavah is strong as mavet (death) ; kinah (jealousy) as unyielding as Sheol; the flames thereof are flames of eish, the flame of Hashem."
Shir Hashirim,8,7,"Mayim rabbim (many waters) cannot quench HaAhavah, neither can the floods drown it; if a man would give all the wealth of his bais for ahavah, it would be utterly scorned."
Shir Hashirim,8,8,"We have an achot ketannah (little sister) , and she hath as yet no breasts. What shall we do for achoteinu (our sister) in the day when she shall be spoken for?"
Shir Hashirim,8,9,"If she be a chomah (wall) , we will build upon her a pinnacle of kesef; and if she be a delet (door) , we will enclose her with panels of cedar."
Shir Hashirim,8,10,"I am a chomah (wall) , and my breasts, like migdalot; then was I in his eyes like one that findeth shalom."
Shir Hashirim,8,11,Sh'lomo had a kerem (vineyard) at Ba'al-Hamon; he gave over the kerem (vineyard) unto caretakers; each had to pay a thousand pieces of kesef for the p'ri (fruit) thereof.
Shir Hashirim,8,12,"My kerem (vineyard) , which is mine, is at my own disposal; thou, O Sh'lomo, the thousand are for thee, and two hundred for those that tend the p'ri thereof!"
Shir Hashirim,8,13,"Thou that dwellest in the ganim (gardens) , the chaverim are listening for thy voice; cause me to hear it."
Shir Hashirim,8,14,"Make haste, dodi (my beloved) , and be thou like to a gazelle or a young deer upon the mountains where spices grow."
