Nechemyah,1,1,"The Divrei Nechemyah ben Chakhalyah. And it came to pass in the month Kislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the capital,"
Nechemyah,1,2,"That Chanani, one of my achim, came, he and certain men, from Yehudah; and I asked them concerning the remnant of the Yehudim that had survived the Exile, and concerning Yerushalayim."
Nechemyah,1,3,"And they said unto me, The remnant that have survived the Exile there in the province are in ra'ah gedolah and reproach; the Chomat Yerushalayim also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with eish."
Nechemyah,1,4,"And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned for several yamim, and did a tzom, and davened before Elohei HaShomayim,"
Nechemyah,1,5,"And said, O Hashem Elohei HaShomayim, HaEl HaGadol v'HaNora, that is shomer habrit vachesed for them that love Him and are shomer mitzvot over His commandments,"
Nechemyah,1,6,"Let Thine ear now be attentive, and Thine eyes open, that Thou mayest hear the tefillah of Thy eved, which I am davening before Thee now, yomam valailah, for the Bnei Yisroel Thy avadim, and mitvaddeh al chattot (confess the sins) of the Bnei Yisroel, which we have sinned against Thee. Both I and the Bais Avi have sinned."
Nechemyah,1,7,"We have dealt very corruptly against Thee, and have not been shomer mitzvot, neither over the chukkim, nor the mishpatim, which Thou commandedst Moshe Thy eved."
Nechemyah,1,8,"Remember, the word that Thou commandedst Moshe Thy eved, saying, If ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations,"
Nechemyah,1,9,"But if ye make teshuvah and turn unto Me, and are shomer over My mitzvot, and do them; though there were of you those exiled unto the uttermost part of HaShomayim, yet will I gather them from there, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to make dwell Shmi (My Name) there."
Nechemyah,1,10,"Now these are Thy Avadim and Thy Am, whom Thou hast redeemed by Thy ko'ach hagadol, and by Thy Yad HaChazakah."
Nechemyah,1,11,"O Adonoi, let now Thine ear be attentive to the tefillah of Thy eved, and to the tefillah of Thy Avadim, who desire to fear Thy Shem; and give success to Thy eved today, and grant him rachamim in the sight of this man. For I was the Mashkeh l'Melech."
Nechemyah,2,1,"And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artachshasta HaMelech, that yayin was before him; and I took up the yayin, and gave it unto HaMelech.Now I had not been previously sad in his presence."
Nechemyah,2,2,"Wherefore HaMelech said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not choleh (sick) ? This is nothing else but ro'ah lev. Then I was very much afraid,"
Nechemyah,2,3,"And said unto HaMelech, HaMelech l'olam yicheyeh. Why should not my countenance look sad, when HaIr, the Bais Kivrot Avotai, lieth in ruins, and the gates thereof are consumed with eish?"
Nechemyah,2,4,"Then HaMelech said unto me, For what dost Thou make request? So I davened to Elohei HaShomayim."
Nechemyah,2,5,"And I said unto HaMelech, If it please HaMelech, and if thy eved have found favor in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Yehudah, unto the Ir Kivrot Avotai, that I may rebuild her."
Nechemyah,2,6,"And HaMelech said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall thy journey be, and when wilt thou return? So it pleased HaMelech to send me; and I set for him a zman."
Nechemyah,2,7,"Moreover I said unto HaMelech, If it please HaMelech, let iggrot be given me to the governors Beyond the River, that they may provide me safe conduct till I come into Yehudah;"
Nechemyah,2,8,"And an iggeret unto Asaph the Shomer of the forest of HaMelech, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the fortress by the Beis, and for the Chomat HaIr, and for the bais that I shall occupy. And HaMelech granted me, according to the Yad Elohai Hatovah upon me."
Nechemyah,2,9,"Then I came to the governors Beyond the River, and gave them the Iggrot HaMelech. Now HaMelech had sent captains of the army and parashim (a troop of horsemen) with me."
Nechemyah,2,10,"When Sanvalat the Choroni, and Toviyah the eved (official) , the Ammoni, heard of it, it grieved them with a ra'ah gedolah that there was come an adam to seek the welfare of the Bnei Yisroel."
Nechemyah,2,11,So I came to Yerushalayim; was there 3 yamim.
Nechemyah,2,12,"And I arose in the lailah, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what Elohai had put in my lev to do for Yerushalayim; neither was there any mount with me, save the mount that I rode upon."
Nechemyah,2,13,"And I went out by lailah by the Valley Gate, even before the Dragonʼs Spring, and to the Dung Gate, and made inspection of the Chomat Yerushalayim, which had been broken down, and the gates thereof that were consumed with eish."
Nechemyah,2,14,"Then I went on to the Fountain Gate, and to the Kingʼs Pool, but there was no place for the mount that was under me to pass."
Nechemyah,2,15,"Then went I up in the lailah by way of the valley, and viewed the Chomah (Wall) , and turned back, and entered by the Valley Gate, and so returned."
Nechemyah,2,16,"And the officials knew not where I went, or what I did; neither as yet to the Yehudim, nor to the Kohanim, nor to the Nobles, nor to the Rulers, nor to the rest that were to do the melachah (work) had I said anything."
Nechemyah,2,17,"Then said I unto them, Ye see hara'ah (the trouble) that we are in, how Yerushalayim lieth in ruins, and the gates thereof are burned with eish; come, and let us rebuild the Chomat Yerushalayim, that we suffer derision no more."
Nechemyah,2,18,"Then I told them of the Yad Elohai Hatovah which was upon me; as also the Divrei HaMelech that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and rebuild. So they strengthened their hands in tovah (in the good)."
Nechemyah,2,19,"But when Sanvalat the Choroni, and Toviyah the eved (official) , the Ammoni, and Geshem the Arab, heard it, they laughed at us in mockery, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do? Against HaMelech will you be moredim (ones rebelling)?"
Nechemyah,2,20,"Then answered I them, and said unto them, Elohei HaShomayim, He will give us success; therefore we His avadim will arise and rebuild; but ye have no chelek (allotted portion) , nor tzadakah (right) , nor zikaron b'Yerushalayim (history to commemorate in Jerusalem)."
Nechemyah,3,1,"Then Elyashiv the Kohen HaGadol rose up with his achim the Kohanim, and they rebuilt the Sheep Gate; they set it apart as kodesh, and set up the daletot of it; even unto the Migdal HaMe'ah they set it apart as kodesh, unto the Migdal Chanan'el."
Nechemyah,3,2,And next unto him the Anshei Yericho built. And next to them built Zakkur ben Imri.
Nechemyah,3,3,"But the Fish Gate did the Bnei Hasnaah build, who also laid the beams thereof, and set up the daletot thereof, the locks, and the bars thereof."
Nechemyah,3,4,And next unto them Meremot ben Uriyah ben Hakotz made repairs. And next unto them Meshullam ben Berekhyah ben Meshezav'el made repairs. And next unto them Tzadok ben Ba'ana did so.
Nechemyah,3,5,And next unto them the Tekoim built; but their Nobles put not their necks to the Avodas adoneihem.
Nechemyah,3,6,"Moreover Yoyada ben Paseach and Meshullam ben Besodyah made repairs on the Sha'ar HaYeshanah; they laid the beams thereof, and set up the daletot, and the locks, and the bars thereof."
Nechemyah,3,7,"And next unto them repaired Melatyah the Giv'oni, and Yadon the Meronoti, the men of Giv'on, and of Mitzpah, upto the seat of the governor of Beyond the River."
Nechemyah,3,8,"Next unto him repaired Uzziel ben Charhayah, one of the goldsmiths. Next unto him also repaired Chananyah son of the perfumers, and they fortified Yerushalayim upto the Broad Wall."
Nechemyah,3,9,"And next unto them repaired Refayah ben Chur, the ruler of half the district of Yerushalayim."
Nechemyah,3,10,"And next unto them repaired Yedayah ben Charumaph, opposite his bais. And next unto him repaired Chattush ben Chashavneyah."
Nechemyah,3,11,"Malkiyah ben Charim, and Chashuv ben Pachat-Moav, repaired the other section, and the Migdal HaTannurim."
Nechemyah,3,12,"And next unto him repaired Shallum ben Halochesh, the ruler of half the district of Yerushalayim, he and his banot."
Nechemyah,3,13,"The Valley Gate repaired Chanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoach; they rebuilt it, and set up the daletot thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and 1,000 cubits of Chomah unto the Dung Gate."
Nechemyah,3,14,"But the Dung Gate did Malkiyah ben Rechav, the ruler of the district of Beit-Hakerem repair; he rebuilt it, and set up the daletot thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof."
Nechemyah,3,15,"But the Fountain Gate did Shallun ben Kol-Chozeh, ruler of Mitzpah district repair; he rebuilt it, covered it, set up the daletot thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and the chomah of the Pool of Shelach by the Gan HaMelech, and upto the stairs that go down from the Ir Dovid."
Nechemyah,3,16,"After him repaired Nechemyah ben Azbuk, the ruler of half the district of Beit-Tzur, unto the place opposite the Kivrei Dovid, and to the artificial pool, and unto the Bais HaGiborim."
Nechemyah,3,17,"After him repaired the Levi'im, Rechum ben Bani. Next unto him repaired Chashavyah, the ruler of half the district of Ke'ilah, in his district."
Nechemyah,3,18,"After him repaired their achim, Bavai ben Chenadad, ruler half the Ke'ilah district."
Nechemyah,3,19,"And next to him repaired Ezer ben Yeshua, the ruler of Mitzpah, another section fronting the ascent to the armory at the Corner."
Nechemyah,3,20,"After him Baruch ben Zakai zealously repaired the other section, from the Corner unto the petach Bais Elyashiv the Kohen HaGadol."
Nechemyah,3,21,"After him repaired Meremot ben Uriyah ben Hakotz another section, from the entrance of the Bais Elyashiv even to the end of the Bais Elyashiv."
Nechemyah,3,22,"And after him repaired the Kohanim, who were the men of the surrounding area."
Nechemyah,3,23,After him repaired Binyamin and Chashuv opposite their bais. After him repaired Azaryah ben Ma'aseiyah ben Ananyah etzel (beside) his bais.
Nechemyah,3,24,"After him repaired Binnui ben Chenadad another section, from the bais Azaryah unto the Corner, even unto the Pinnah."
Nechemyah,3,25,"Palal ben Uzai, opposite the Corner, and the Migdal which projects from upper part of the Bais HaMelech, that was by the khatzer (court) of the Guard. After him Pedayah ben Parosh,"
Nechemyah,3,26,"And the Netenim (servants of the Bais Hamikdash) dwelt on Ophel, made repairs unto the place opposite the Water Gate on the east, and the migdal that projects out."
Nechemyah,3,27,"After them the Tekoim repaired another section, opposite the great migdal that projects out, even unto the Chomat Ophel."
Nechemyah,3,28,"From above the Horse Gate repaired the Kohanim, every one opposite his bais."
Nechemyah,3,29,"After them repaired Tzadok ben Immer opposite his bais. After him repaired also Shema'yah ben Shechanyah, the Shomer of the East Gate."
Nechemyah,3,30,"After him repaired Chananyah ben Shelemyah, and Chanun the sixth son of Tzalaph, another section. After him repaired Meshullam ben Berekhyah opposite his living quarters."
Nechemyah,3,31,"After him repaired Malkiyah one of the goldsmiths unto the place of the Netenim, and of the merchants, opposite the Sha'ar HaMifkad, and to the aliyyat hapinnah."
Nechemyah,3,32,And between the aliyyat hapinnah unto the Sheep Gate repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants.
Nechemyah,4,1,"But it came to pass, that when Sanvalat heard that we were rebuilding the Chomah, he was angered, took great indignation, mocked the Yehudim."
Nechemyah,4,2,"And he spoke before his brethren and the army of Shomron, and said, What do these feeble Yehudim? Will they fortify themselves? Will they sacrifice? Will they finish in a day? Will they revive the avanim out of the heaps of the burned rubble?"
Nechemyah,4,3,"Now Toviyah the Ammoni was by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox climb up on it, even he shall break down their chomat avanim."
Nechemyah,4,4,"Shema, Eloheinu, for we are despised; turn their insults upon their own head, and give them as plunder in a land of captivity;"
Nechemyah,4,5,"And cover not their avon, and let not their chattat be blotted out from before thee, for they threw insults in the face of HaBonim."
Nechemyah,4,6,"So we rebuilt HaChomah, and kol HaChomah was joined together unto half the height thereof, for HaAm had a mind to work."
Nechemyah,4,7,"But it came to pass, that when Sanvalat, and Toviyah, and the Arabs, and the Ammonim, and the Ashdodim, heard about the Chomat Yerushalayim, that its repairs had gone ahead, and that the gaps began to be closed up, then they were very angry,"
Nechemyah,4,8,"And they plotted all of them together to come and to fight against Yerushalayim, and to hinder it."
Nechemyah,4,9,"Nevertheless we davened unto Eloheinu, and set a watch against them yomam valailah, because of them."
Nechemyah,4,10,"And Yehudah said, The koach of the bearers of burdens is giving out, and there is much rubble, so that we are not able to rebuild the Chomah (Wall)."
Nechemyah,4,11,"And our adversaries said, They shall have no da'as, neither see, till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the melachah (work) to cease."
Nechemyah,4,12,"And it came to pass, that when the Yehudim which dwelt near them came, they said unto us eser pe'amim, Wherever ye turn, they will be upon us."
Nechemyah,4,13,"Therefore set I behind the lower places of the Chomah, and on the exposed places, I even set HaAm by their mishpekhot with their swords, their spears, and their bows."
Nechemyah,4,14,"And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the Nobles, and to the Officials, and to the rest of HaAm, Be not ye afraid of them. Remember Adonoi HaGadol vHaNorah, and fight for your achim, your banim, and your banot, your nashim, and your batim."
Nechemyah,4,15,"And it came to pass, when our enemies were aware that it was known unto us, and HaElohim had brought their etzah (plan) to nought, that we returned all of us to HaChomah, every one unto his melachah (work)."
Nechemyah,4,16,"And it came to pass from that day forth, that half of my men did the melachah, and the other half of them held the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the body armor; and the officials posted themselves behind Kol Bais Yehudah"
Nechemyah,4,17,"Who were HaBonim BaChomah. And they that bore burdens, carried their loads such that each one with one of his hands did the melachah, and with the other hand held a weapon."
Nechemyah,4,18,"For the Bonim, every one had his cherev girded by his side, and so built. And he that sounded the shofar was by me."
Nechemyah,4,19,"And I said unto the Nobles, and to the Officials, and to the rest of haAm, The melachah is great and spread out, and we are separated along the Chomah, one far from another."
Nechemyah,4,20,"In what place therefore ye hear the kol haShofar, rally ye thither unto us; Eloheinu shall fight for us."
Nechemyah,4,21,"So we labored in the melachah, and half of them held the spears from the break of dawn till the kokhavim appeared."
Nechemyah,4,22,"Likewise at the same time said I unto HaAm, Let every one with his servant lodge within Yerushalayim, that in halailah they may be a mishmar (guard) to us, and at hayom a melachah (workman)."
Nechemyah,4,23,"So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my men, nor the anshei hamishmar (the men of the guard) which followed me, none of us put off our clothes; every one carried his weapon, even when he went for water."
Nechemyah,5,1,And there was a great outcry of HaAm and of their nashim against their achim the Yehudim.
Nechemyah,5,2,"For there were that said, We, our banim, and our banot, are rabbim (many) ; therefore we must get dagan (grain) for them, that we may eat, and live."
Nechemyah,5,3,"Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our sadot (fields) , kramim (vineyards) , and batim (houses) , that we might buy dagan, because of the ra'av (famine)."
Nechemyah,5,4,"There were also that said, We have borrowed kesef for the tax of HaMelech, and that upon our sadot and kramim."
Nechemyah,5,5,"Yet now our basar is the same as the basar of acheinu (our brethren, countrymen) , our banot as their banot; and, hinei, we bring into the bondage of slavery our banim and our banot, and some of our banot are brought unto bondage already, neither is it in our power to redeem them, for other men have our sadot and kramim."
Nechemyah,5,6,And I was very angry when I heard their outcry and these devarim.
Nechemyah,5,7,"Then I consulted my own thoughts, and I rebuked the Nobles, and the officials, and said unto them, Ye exact massa (usury), every one from his brother. And I called a kehillah gedolah against them."
Nechemyah,5,8,"And I said unto them, We as far as we have ability have redeemed acheinu (bought back our brethren) the Yehudim, which were sold unto the Goyim; and will ye even sell your brethren? Or shall they be sold back unto us? Then they were speechless, and found nothing to answer."
Nechemyah,5,9,"Also I said, It is not tov this thing ye are doing. Ought ye not to walk in the fear of Eloheinu and end the derision of the Goyim oyveinu (our enemies)?"
Nechemyah,5,10,"I likewise, and my brethren, and my men, have allowed them to borrow kesef and dagan; let us stop now this massa (burden of debt)."
Nechemyah,5,11,"Restore, now, to them, even today, their sadot, their kramim, their zayit groves, and their batim (houses) , also the usury of the hundredth part of the kesef, and of the dagan, the tirosh (new wine) , and the yitzhar (olive oil) , that ye exact of them."
Nechemyah,5,12,"Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I summoned the Kohanim, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise."
Nechemyah,5,13,"Also I shook out the fold of my robe, and said, So may HaElohim shake out every man from his bais, and from that which belongs to him, that keepeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And Kol HaKahal said, Omein, and praised Hashem . And HaAm did according to this promise."
Nechemyah,5,14,"Moreover, from the yom that I was appointed to be their governor in Eretz Yehudah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artachshasta HaMelech, that is, twelve shanim, I and my brethren have not eaten the Lechem HaPechah (Allowance of the Governor)."
Nechemyah,5,15,"But the former governors that had been before me placed a heavy burden on HaAm, and had taken of them lechem and yayin, in addition to the forty shekels of kesef; yea, even their assistants domineered HaAm; but so did not I, because of yirat Elohim."
Nechemyah,5,16,"But instead I continued in the melekhet HaChomah (work of this Wall) , neither acquired we any sadeh; and all my men were gathered there unto the melachah (work)."
Nechemyah,5,17,"Moreover there were at my shulchan a hundred and fifty of the Yehudim and officials, besides those that came unto us from among the Goyim around us."
Nechemyah,5,18,"Now that which was prepared daily was one shor (ox) and six choice sheep; also poultry were prepared at my expense, and every ten days skins of yayin in quantity of all kinds; yet for all this required not I the Lechem HaPechah, because the avodah was heavy upon this people."
Nechemyah,5,19,"Remember me, Elohai, for tovah, according to all that I have done for this people."
Nechemyah,6,1,"Now it came to pass when Sanvalat, and Toviyah, and Geshem the Arab, and the rest of oyveinu (our enemies) , heard that I had rebuilt HaChomah, and that there was no peretz (gap) left therein (though at that time I had not set up the dalatot in the she'arim),"
Nechemyah,6,2,"That Sanvalat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they were choshevim (the ones scheming) to do me ra'ah (harm)."
Nechemyah,6,3,"And I sent malachim unto them, saying, I am doing a melachah gedolah, so that I cannot come down. Why should the melachah cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?"
Nechemyah,6,4,Yet they sent unto me this message arbah pe'amim; and I answered them after the same manner.
Nechemyah,6,5,Then sent Sanvalat his aid unto me in like manner the fifth time with an unsealed iggeret in his hand;
Nechemyah,6,6,"Wherein was written, It is reported among the Goyim, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Yehudim are choshevim (the ones scheming) revolt, for which cause thou buildest the Chomah, that thou mayest be their Melech, according to these reports."
Nechemyah,6,7,"And thou hast also appointed nevi'im to make this proclamation about thee at Yerushalayim, saying, There is a Melech in Yehudah! Now this report will get back to HaMelech. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together."
Nechemyah,6,8,"Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such devarim (things) done as thou sayest, but thou inventest them out of thine own lev."
Nechemyah,6,9,"For they all were trying to make us afraid, saying, Their hands shall get too weakened for the melachah, that it be not completed. Now therefore, strengthen my hands!"
Nechemyah,6,10,"Afterward I came unto the bais Shema'yah ben Delayah ben Mehetave'el, who was confined; and he said, Let us meet together in the Bais HaElohim, within the Heikhal, and let us close the dalatot of the Heikhal, for they will come to slay thee; yea, tonight they come to slay thee."
Nechemyah,6,11,"And I said, Should such a man as I flee? And who is there, that, being as I am, would go into the Heikhal to save his life? I will not go in."
Nechemyah,6,12,"And, hinei, I perceived that Elohim had not sent him; but that he pronounced this nevu'ah (prophecy) against me, for Toviyah and Sanvalat had hired him."
Nechemyah,6,13,"Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have given me a shem rah (bad name) , that they might discredit me."
Nechemyah,6,14,"Remember, Elohai, Toviyah and Sanvalat according to these their ma'asim, and also the neviah (prophetess) Noadyah, and the rest of the nevi'im, that would have intimidated me."
Nechemyah,6,15,"So the Chomah was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days."
Nechemyah,6,16,"And it came to pass, that when all oyveinu (our enemies) heard thereof, and all the Goyim around us saw these things, they were much cast down in their own eyes, for they perceived that this melachah was accomplished by Eloheinu."
Nechemyah,6,17,"Moreover in those days the nobles of Yehudah sent many iggerot unto Toviyah, and the iggrot of Toviyah were making reply unto them."
Nechemyah,6,18,"For there were many ba'alei shevuah in Yehudah unto him, because he was the choson (son-in-law) of Shechanyah ben Arach, and his son Yehochanan had taken the bat Meshullam ben Berekhyah."
Nechemyah,6,19,"Also they reported his merits before me, and uttered my words to him. And Toviyah sent letters with the intent of intimidating me."
Nechemyah,7,1,"Now it came to pass, when the chomah was rebuilt, and I had set up the dalatot, and the gatekeepers and the singers and the Levi'im were appointed,"
Nechemyah,7,2,"That I gave my brother Chanani, along with Chananyah (the commander of the citadel) , charge over Yerushalayim, for he was an ish emes, and feared HaElohim more than many."
Nechemyah,7,3,"And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Yerushalayim be opened until the shemesh be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the dalatot, and bar them, and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Yerushalayim, every one in his watch, and every one to be near his bais."
Nechemyah,7,4,"Now the Ir was large and gedolah, but HaAm were few therein, and the batim (houses) were not rebuilt."
Nechemyah,7,5,"And Elohai put into mine lev to gather together the nobles, and the officials, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found a Sefer HaYachash (record of the genealogy) of them which came up at the first, and found written therein:"
Nechemyah,7,6,"These are the people of the province, that went up out of the Golus captivity, of those that had been carried away, whom Nevukhadnetzar Melech Bavel had carried away, and came again to Yerushalayim and to Yehudah, everyone unto his town;"
Nechemyah,7,7,"Who came with Zerubavel, Yeshua, Nechemyah, Azaryah, Ra'amyah, Nachamani, Mordechai, Bilshan, Misperet, Bigvai, Nechum, and Ba'anah. The number of the men of the people of Yisroel was this:"

Nechemyah,7,63,"And of the kohanim; the Bnei Chavayah, the Bnei Hakotz, the Bnei Barzillai, which took one of the banot of Barzillai the Gil'adi to wife, and was named after their shem."
Nechemyah,7,64,"These sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy, but it was not found; therefore were they, as polluted, put from the Kehunah (Priesthood)."
Nechemyah,7,65,And the Tirshata said unto them that they should not eat of the kodesh hakodashim until there stood up a kohen with Urim and Tummim.
Nechemyah,7,66,"The kol hakahal together was 42,360,"
Nechemyah,7,67,"not counting their manservants and their maidservants, of whom there were 7,337; and they had 245 meshorarim (singing men) and meshorarot (singing women)."

Nechemyah,7,69,"Their camels, four hundred thirty and five; six thousand seven hundred and twenty donkeys."

Nechemyah,7,71,"And some of the chief of the avot gave to the treasury of the work twenty thousand drachmas of zahav, and two thousand and two hundred manim of kesef."
Nechemyah,7,72,"And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand drachmas of zahav, and two thousand manim of kesef, and threescore and seven kasenos for the Kohanim."
Nechemyah,7,73,"So the Kohanim, and the Levi'im, and the gatekeepers, and the singers, and some of the people, and the Netinim, and kol Yisroel, dwelt in their towns;"
Nechemyah,7,74,"and when the seventh month came, the Bnei Yisroel were in their towns."
Nechemyah,8,1,"And kol HaAm gathered themselves together as one man into the rechov that was before the Water Gate; and they spoke unto Ezra HaSofer to bring the Sefer Torat Moshe, which Hashem had commanded to Yisroel."
Nechemyah,8,2,"And Ezra HaKohen brought the Torah before the Kahal both of men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month."
Nechemyah,8,3,"And he read therein before the rechov that was before the Water Gate from the morning until midday, before the men and the women, and those that could understand; and the ears of kol HaAm were attentive unto the Sefer HaTorah."
Nechemyah,8,4,"And Ezra HaSofer stood upon a platform of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattityah, and Shema, and Anayah, and Uriyah, and Chilkiyah, and Ma'aseiyah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedayah, and Mishael, and Malkiyah, and Chashum, and Chashbadanah, Zecharyah, and Meshullam."
Nechemyah,8,5,"And Ezra opened the Sefer before the eyes of kol HaAm (for he was above kol HaAm) ; and when he opened it, all the people stood up."
Nechemyah,8,6,"And Ezra blessed Hashem , HaElohim HaGadol. And kol HaAm answered, Omein, Omein, with lifting up their hands; and they bowed, and worshiped Hashem with their faces to the ground."
Nechemyah,8,7,"Also Yeshua, and Bani, and Sherevyah, Yamin, Akkuv, Shabetai, Hodiyah, Ma'aseiyah, Kelita, Azaryah, Yozavad, Chanan, Pelayah, and the Levi'im caused the people to understand the Torah; and the people stood in their place."
Nechemyah,8,8,"So they read from the Sefer Torat HaElohim distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading."
Nechemyah,8,9,"And Nechemyah the Tirshata, and Ezra HaKohen HaSofer, and the Levi'im that taught the people, said unto all the people, This day is kadosh unto Hashem Eloheichem; mourn not, nor weep. For kol HaAm wept, when they heard the words of the Torah."
Nechemyah,8,10,"Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the choice foods, and drink the sweet things, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared; for this day is kadosh unto Adoneinu; neither be ye grieving; for the chedvah (joy) of Hashem is your strength."
Nechemyah,8,11,"So the Levi'im calmed kol HaAm, saying, Be still, for the day is kadosh; neither be ye grieved."
Nechemyah,8,12,"And kol HaAm went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make simchah gedolah, because they had understood the words that were declared unto them."
Nechemyah,8,13,"And on the second day were gathered together the chief of the avot of kol HaAm, the Kohanim, and the Levi'im, unto Ezra HaSofer, to understand the words of the Torah."
Nechemyah,8,14,"And they found written in the Torah which Hashem had commanded by Moshe, that the Bnei Yisroel should dwell in sukkot in the Chag of the seventh month,"
Nechemyah,8,15,"And that they should publish and proclaim in all their towns, and in Yerushalayim, saying, Go forth unto the hill country, and bring back olive branches, and wild olive branches, and myrtle, and palm branches, and branches of leafy trees, to make sukkot, as it is written."
Nechemyah,8,16,"So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves sukkot, every one upon the roof of his bais, and in their courtyards, and in the khatzerot Bais HaElohim, and in the rechov of the Water Gate, and in the rechov of the Ephrayim Gate."
Nechemyah,8,17,"And kol HaKahal of them that were come again out of the captivity made sukkot, and sat under the sukkot; for since the days of Yeshua ben Nun unto that day had not the Bnei Yisroel done so. And there was simchah gedolah."
Nechemyah,8,18,"Also day by day, from the first day unto the last, he read from the Sefer Torat HaElohim. And they kept the Chag seven days; and then came Shmini Atzeret, according unto the mishpat."
Nechemyah,9,1,"Now in the 24th day of this month the Bnei Yisroel were assembled with a tzom, with sack-cloth, and adamah upon them."
Nechemyah,9,2,"And the Zera Yisroel separated themselves from all foreigners, and stood and confessed their chattot, and the avonot of their avot."
Nechemyah,9,3,"And they stood up in their place, and read in the Sefer Torat Hashem Eloheihem one fourth part of the day; and another fourth part they confessed, and worshiped Hashem Eloheihem."
Nechemyah,9,4,"Then stood up upon the platform, of the Levi'im, Yeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shevanyah, Bunni, Sherevyah, Bani, and Kenani, and cried with a kol gadol unto Hashem Eloheihem."
Nechemyah,9,5,"Then the Levi'im, Yeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Chashavneyah, Sherevyah, Hodiyah, Shevanyah, and Petachyah, said, Stand up and bless Hashem Eloheichem for ever and ever; and blessed be Shem Kevodecha, which is exalted above all brocha and tehillah."
Nechemyah,9,6,"Thou, even Thou, art Hashem alone; Thou hast made HaShomayim, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, ha'aretz, and all things that are therein, the seas, and all that is therein, and Thou preservest them all; and the Tz'va HaShomayim worshipeth Thee."
Nechemyah,9,7,"Thou art Hashem HaElohim, Who didst choose Avram, and broughtest him forth out of Ur Kasdim, and gavest shmo Avraham;"
Nechemyah,9,8,"And foundest his lev ne'eman before Thee, and madest habrit (the covenant) with him to give the eretz HaKena'ani, the Chitti, the Emori, and the Perizzi, and the Yevusi, and the Girgashi, to give it to his zera, and hast performed Thy words; for Thou art tzaddik;"
Nechemyah,9,9,"And didst see the affliction of Avoteinu in Mitzrayim, and heardest their cry by the Yam Suf;"
Nechemyah,9,10,"And showedst otot and mofetim upon Pharaoh, and on all his avadim, and on kol HaAm of his land; for Thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them. So didst Thou get Thee a Shem, as it is this day."
Nechemyah,9,11,"And Thou didst divide the yam before them, so that they went through the midst of the yam on the yabashah; and their persecutors Thou threwest into the depths, as an even (stone) into the mighty waters."
Nechemyah,9,12,"Moreover Thou leddest them in the day by an Ammud Anan; and in the night by an Ammud Eish, to give them ohr in the way wherein they should go."
Nechemyah,9,13,"Thou camest down also upon Mt Sinai, and spoke with them from Shomayim, and gavest them mishpatim yesharim, and torot emes, chukkim and mitzvot tovim;"
Nechemyah,9,14,"And madest known unto them Thy Shabbos Kadosh, and commandedst them mitzvot, chukkim, and torah, by the yad of Moshe Thy eved;"
Nechemyah,9,15,"And gavest them lechem from Shomayim for their hunger, and broughtest forth mayim for them out of the rock for their thirst, and promisedst them that they should go in to possess Ha'Aretz which Thou hadst sworn to give them."
Nechemyah,9,16,"But they and Avoteinu dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and paid heed not to Thy mitzvot,"
Nechemyah,9,17,"And refused to obey, neither were mindful of Thy wonders that Thou didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a rosh to return to their bondage; but Thou art Eloah Selichot, channun and rachum, slow to anger, and of great chesed, and forsookest them not."
Nechemyah,9,18,"Yea, when they had made them an egel massekhah, and said, This is Eloheicha that brought thee up out of Mitzrayim, or when they committed ne'atzot gedolot (great blasphemies);"
Nechemyah,9,19,"Yet Thou in Thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the midbar; the Ammud heAnan departed not from them by day, to lead them in HaDerech; neither the Ammud HaEish by night, to show them light, and HaDerech wherein they should walk."
Nechemyah,9,20,"Thou gavest also Thy Ruach HaTovah to instruct them, and withheldest not Thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them mayim for their thirst."
Nechemyah,9,21,"Yea, arba'im shanah didst Thou sustain them in the midbar, so that they lacked nothing; their clothes did not wear out, and their feet swelled not."
Nechemyah,9,22,"Moreover Thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, allotting them as a boundary; so they possessed Eretz Sichon, and Eretz Melech Cheshbon, and Eretz Og Melech HaBashan."
Nechemyah,9,23,"Their children also multipliedst Thou as the kokhavim of Shomayim, and broughtest them into Ha'Aretz, concerning which Thou hadst promised to their avot, that they should go in to possess it."
Nechemyah,9,24,"So the children went in and possessed Ha'Aretz, and Thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Kena'anim, and gavest them into their hands, with their melachim, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they would."
Nechemyah,9,25,"And they took fortified cities, and an adamah shemenah, and possessed batim full of all goods, wells dug, kramim, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance; so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness."
Nechemyah,9,26,"Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against Thee, and cast Thy torah behind their backs, and slaughtered Thy nevi'im which testified against them to turn them to Thee, and they wrought ne'atzot gedolot."
Nechemyah,9,27,"Therefore Thou deliveredst them into the yad of their enemies, who oppressed them; and in the time of their tzoros, when they cried unto Thee, Thou heardest them from Shomayim; and according to Thy manifold mercies Thou gavest them moshi'im (deliverers) , who saved them out of the yad of their enemies."
Nechemyah,9,28,"But after they had rest, they did rah again before Thee; therefore Thou abandoned them unto the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them; yet when they returned, cried unto Thee, Thou heardest them from Shomayim; and many times didst Thou deliver them according to Thy mercies;"
Nechemyah,9,29,"And testifiedst against them, that Thou mightest bring them again unto Thy torah; yet they dealt proudly, and paid heed not unto Thy mitzvot, but sinned against Thy mishpatim, which if a man do, he shall live in them; and they stubbornly turned their backs, and hardened their neck, and would not hear."
Nechemyah,9,30,"Yet many shanim didst Thou forbear them, and testifiedst against them by Thy Ruach by Thy nevi'im; yet would they not give ear; therefore gavest Thou them into the yad of the peoples of the lands."
Nechemyah,9,31,"Nevertheless for Thy great merciesʼ sake Thou didst not utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for Thou art El Channun v'Rachum."
Nechemyah,9,32,"Now therefore, Eloheinu, the great, the mighty, and the terrible G-d, Who keepest brit and chesed, let not all the hardships seem little before Thee, that hath come upon us, on melacheinu, on sareinu, and on Kohaneinu, and on nevi'einu, and on Avoteinu, and on all Thy people, since the time of the melachim of Assyria unto this day."
Nechemyah,9,33,"Howbeit Thou art tzaddik in all that is brought upon us; for Thou hast done emes, but we have done wrong;"
Nechemyah,9,34,"Neither have melacheinu, sareinu, Kohaneinu, nor Avoteinu, kept Thy torah, nor paid heed unto Thy mitzvot and Thy testimonies, wherewith Thou didst testify against them."
Nechemyah,9,35,"For they have not served Thee in their malchut, and in Thy great goodness that Thou gavest them, and in the large and fertile land which Thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works."
Nechemyah,9,36,"Hinei, we are avadim this day, and for the land that Thou gavest unto Avoteinu to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, hinei, we are avadim in it;"
Nechemyah,9,37,"And it yieldeth much increase unto the melachim whom Thou hast set over us because of chattoteinu; also they have dominion over geviyyoteinu, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in tzarah gedolah."
Nechemyah,9,38,"And because of all this we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our sarim, Levi'im, and Kohanim, seal unto it."
Nechemyah,10,1,"Now those that sealed were, Nechemyah the tirshata ben Chakhalyah, and Tzidkiyah,"

Nechemyah,10,29,"They were the machazikim (the ones joining) with their brethren, their nobles, and bound themselves with a curse, and into an oath, to walk in Torat HaElohim, which was given by Moshe Eved HaElohim, and to be shomer to do all the mitzvot of Hashem Adoneinu, and His mishpatim and His chukkot;"
Nechemyah,10,30,"And that we would not give our banot unto the peoples of the land, not take their banot for our banim;"
Nechemyah,10,31,"And if the people of the land bring merchandise or any grain on Shabbos or on Yom Kodesh to sell, that we would not buy it of them on Shabbos, or on Yom Kodesh; and that we would every Shanah HaShevi'it forgo working the land and will cancel all debts."

Nechemyah,10,34,"And we cast the goralot among the Kohanim, the Levi'im, and the people, for the korban of the wood, to bring it into the Beis Eloheinu, after the batim of Avoteinu, at times appointed year by year, to burn upon the Mizbe'ach of Hashem Eloheinu, as it is written in the Torah;"

Nechemyah,10,38,"And the Kohen Ben Aharon shall be with the Levi'im, when the Levi'im receive tithes; and the Levi'im shall bring up the ma'aser hama'aser unto the Beis Eloheinu, to the storerooms, into the Beis HaOtzar."
Nechemyah,10,39,"For the Bnei Yisroel and the Bnei Levi shall bring the terumah of the grain, of the tirosh, and the oil, unto the storerooms, where are Keli HaMikdash, and the Kohanim that minister, and the gatekeepers, and the singers; and we will not forsake the Beis Eloheinu."

Nechemyah,12,2,"Amaryah, Maluch, Chattush,"
Nechemyah,12,3,"Shechanyah, Rechum, Meremot,"
Nechemyah,12,4,"Iddo, Gintoi, Aviyah,"
Nechemyah,12,5,"Miyamin, Ma'adiyah, Bilgah,"
Nechemyah,12,6,"Shema'yah, and Yoyariv, Yedayah,"
Nechemyah,12,7,"Sallu, Amok, Chilkiyah, Yedayah. These were the chief of the Kohanim and of their brethren in the days of Yeshua."
Nechemyah,12,8,"Moreover the Levi'im; Yeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherevyah, Yehudah, and Matanyah, which was over the huyedot, he and his brethren."
Nechemyah,12,9,"Also Bakbukyah and Unni, their brethren, were opposite them in the mishmarot (services)."
Nechemyah,12,10,"And Yeshua fathered Yoyakim, Yoyakim also fathered Elyashiv, and Elyashiv fathered Yoyada,"
Nechemyah,12,11,"And Yoyada fathered Yonatan, and Yonatan fathered Yaddua."
Nechemyah,12,12,"And in the days of Yoyakim these were Kohanim rashei haAvot; of Serayah, Merayah; of Yirmeyah, Chananyah;"
Nechemyah,12,13,"Of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amaryah, Yehochanan;"
Nechemyah,12,14,"Of Malikhi, Yonatan; of Shevanyah, Yosef;"
Nechemyah,12,15,"Of Charim, Adna; of Merayot, Chelkai;"
Nechemyah,12,16,"Of Iddo, Zecharyah; of Ginton, Meshullam;"
Nechemyah,12,17,"Of Aviyah, Zichri; of Minyamin, of Moadyah, Piltai;"
Nechemyah,12,18,"Of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shema'yah, Yehonatan;"
Nechemyah,12,19,"And of Yoyariv, Matnai; of Yedayah, Uzzi;"
Nechemyah,12,20,"Of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Ever;"
Nechemyah,12,21,"Of Chilkiyah, Chashavyah; of Yedayah, Netanel."
Nechemyah,12,22,"The Levi'im in the days of Elyashiv, Yoyada, and Yochanan, and Yaddua, were recorded rashei haAvot; also the kohanim, to the reign of Daryavesh the Persian."
Nechemyah,12,23,"The Bnei Levi, the rashei haAvot, were written in the Sefer Divrei Hayamim, even until the days of Yochanan ben Elyashiv."
Nechemyah,12,24,"And the chiefs of the Levi'im: Chashavyah, Sherevyah, and Yeshua ben Kadmiel, with their brethren over against them, to praise and to give thanks, according to the mitzvat Dovid Ish HaElohim, choir opposite choir."
Nechemyah,12,25,"Matanyah, and Bakbukyah, Ovadyah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkuv, were gatekeepers keeping the storerooms of the gates."
Nechemyah,12,26,"These were in the days of Yoyakim ben Yeshua ben Yotzadak, and in the days of Nechemyah the governor, and of Ezra HaKohen HaSofer."
Nechemyah,12,27,"And at the dedication of the Chomat Yerushalayim they sought the Levi'im from all their places, to bring them to Yerushalayim, to keep the dedication with simchah, both with todot, and with singing, with cymbals, nevalim, and with kinorot."
Nechemyah,12,28,"And Bnei HaMishorerim gathered themselves together, both out of the region around Yerushalayim, and from the villages of Netophati;"
Nechemyah,12,29,"Also from the Bais Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geva and Azmavet; for the singers had built villages around Yerushalayim."
Nechemyah,12,30,"Kohanim and Levi'im made themselves tahor, and made the people tahor, the gates, and the chomah."
Nechemyah,12,31,"Then I brought up the sarim of Yehudah upon the chomah, and appointed two great choirs to give thanks, whereof one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the Dung Gate;"
Nechemyah,12,32,"And after them went Hoshayah, and half of the sarim of Yehudah,"
Nechemyah,12,33,"And Azaryah, Ezra, and Meshullam,"
Nechemyah,12,34,"Yehudah, Binyamin, Shema'yah, and Yirmeyah,"
Nechemyah,12,35,And certain of the banim of kohanim with trumpets; namely Zecharyah ben Yonatan ben Shema'yah ben Matanyah ben Michayah ben Zakkur ben Asaph;
Nechemyah,12,36,"And his brethren, Shema'yah, and Azare'el, Milalai, Gilalai, Ma'ai, Netanel, and Yehudah, Chanani, with the musical instruments of Dovid the Ish HaElohim, and Ezra the Sofer before them."
Nechemyah,12,37,"And at the Fountain Gate they went up by the steps of Ir Dovid, at the going up of the wall, above the Bais Dovid, even the Water Gate eastward."
Nechemyah,12,38,"The other company of them that gave thanks went opposite them, I after them, and half the people upon the wall, from beyond the Migdal of the Ovens even unto the Broad Wall;"
Nechemyah,12,39,"And from above the Ephrayim Gate, and above the Old Gate, and above the Fish Gate, and the Migdal of Chanan'el, and the Migdal of the Hundred, even unto the Sheep Gate; and they stood still in the Prison Gate."
Nechemyah,12,40,"So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the Beis HaElohim, and I, and the half of the officials with me;"
Nechemyah,12,41,"And the Kohanim: Elyakim, Ma'aseiyah, Minyamin, Michayah, Elyo'einai, Zecharyah, and Chananyah, with trumpets;"
Nechemyah,12,42,"And Ma'aseiyah, Shema'yah, El'azar, Uzzi, Yehochanan, Malkiyah, Eilam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Yizrachyah their overseer."
Nechemyah,12,43,"Also that day they offered zevakhim gedolim, and rejoiced, for HaElohim had made them rejoice with great joy; the wives also and the children rejoiced, so that the joy of Yerushalayim was heard even afar off."
Nechemyah,12,44,"And at that time were some appointed over the storerooms for the Otzarot, for terumot, for the reshit, and for ma'aserot (tithes) , to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions required by the Torah for the Kohanim and Levi'im: for Yehudah rejoiced for the Kohanim and for the Levi'im stationed [in Beis Hashem ]."
Nechemyah,12,45,"They performed the Mishmeret Eloheihem and the Mishmeret HaTahorah according to the commandment of Dovid, and of Sh'lomo bno."
Nechemyah,12,46,"For in the days of Dovid and Asaph of old there were chiefs of the singers, and shir tehillah and hodot unto Elohim."
Nechemyah,12,47,"And kol Yisroel in the days of Zerubavel, and in the days of Nechemyah, gave the portions for the singers and the gatekeepers, every day its portion; and they set aside as kodesh the portion for the Levi'im; and the Levi'im set aside as kodesh the portion for the Bnei Aharon."
Nechemyah,13,1,"On that day they read in the Sefer Moshe in the ears of HaAm; and therein was found written, that the Ammoni and the Moavi should not come into the Kehal HaElohim forever,"
Nechemyah,13,2,"Because they met not the Bnei Yisroel with lechem and with mayim, but hired Balaam against them, that he should curse them; howbeit Eloheinu turned the kelalah into a brocha."
Nechemyah,13,3,"Now it came to pass, when they had heard the Torah, that they separated from Yisroel all the foreign descent."
Nechemyah,13,4,"And before this, Elyashiv the Kohen, having the oversight of the storeroom of the Beis Eloheinu, was allied unto Toviyah;"
Nechemyah,13,5,"And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the minchah, the levonah, and the vessels, and the ma'aser of the grain, the tirosh, and the oil, which was commanded to be given to the Levi'im, and the singers, and the gatekeepers; and the terumat hakohanim."
Nechemyah,13,6,"But in all this time was not I at Yerushalayim; for in the two and thirtieth year of Artachshasta Melech Bavel came I unto HaMelech, and after certain days obtained I leave of HaMelech;"
Nechemyah,13,7,"And I came to Yerushalayim, and understood of the evil that Elyashiv did for Toviyah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the Beis HaElohim."
Nechemyah,13,8,And it grieved me much; therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Toviyah out of the chamber.
Nechemyah,13,9,"Then I commanded, and they made tahor the chambers, and there brought I again the vessels of the Beis HaElohim, with the minchah and the levonah."
Nechemyah,13,10,"And I perceived that the portions of the Levi'im had not been given them, for the Levi'im and the singers, that did the work, had gone back every one to his sadeh."
Nechemyah,13,11,"Then contended I with the officials, and said, Why is the Beis HaElohim forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place."
Nechemyah,13,12,Then brought all Yehudah the ma'asar of the grain and the tirosh and the oil unto the Otzarot.
Nechemyah,13,13,"And I made over the Otzarot Shelemyah the Kohen, and Tzadok the Sofer, and of the Levi'im, Pedayah; and next to them was Chanan ben Zakkur, ben Matanyah; for they were considered ne'emanim, and their office was to distribute unto their brethren."
Nechemyah,13,14,"Remember me, O Elohai, concerning this, and wipe not out my faithful deeds that I have done for the Beis Elohai, and for the offices thereof."
Nechemyah,13,15,"In those days saw I in Yehudah some treading winepresses on Shabbos, and bringing in sheaves, and loading donkeys; as also yayin, grapes, and figs, and all manner of massa (burdens) , which they brought into Yerushalayim on Shabbos; and I warned them against selling food on Shabbos."
Nechemyah,13,16,"There dwelt men of Tzor also therein, which brought dag (fish) , and all manner of merchandise, and sold on Shabbos unto the Bnei Yehudah, and in Yerushalayim."
Nechemyah,13,17,"Then I contended with the nobles of Yehudah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, being Mechallel Shabbos (desecrator of Shabbos)?"
Nechemyah,13,18,"Did not your avot thus, and did not Eloheinu bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? Yet ye bring more wrath upon Yisroel by committing Chillul Shabbos (desecration of Shabbos)."
Nechemyah,13,19,"And it came to pass, that when the gates of Yerushalayim began to be dark before Shabbos, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after Shabbos, and some of my own men set I at the gates, that there should no massa (burden) be brought in on Shabbos."
Nechemyah,13,20,Once or twice the merchants and sellers of all kinds of merchandise lodged outside Yerushalayim.
Nechemyah,13,21,"Then I warned them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? If ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on Shabbos."
Nechemyah,13,22,"And I commanded the Levi'im that they should make themselves tahor, and that they should come and be shomer over the gates, to set apart as kodesh Shabbos. Remember me, O Elohai, concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness of Thy mercy."
Nechemyah,13,23,"In those days also saw I Yehudim that had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moav,"
Nechemyah,13,24,"And their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the language of the Yehudim, but according to the language of one people or another."
Nechemyah,13,25,"And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by Elohim, saying, Ye shall not give your banot unto their banim, nor take their banot unto your banim, or for yourselves."
Nechemyah,13,26,"Did not Sh'lomo Melech Yisroel sin by these things? Yet among many Goyim was there no melech like him, who was beloved of Elohav, and Elohim made him melech over kol Yisroel. Nevertheless even him did foreign women cause to sin."
Nechemyah,13,27,"Shall we then pay heed unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against Eloheinu in marrying strange wives?"
Nechemyah,13,28,"And one of the Bnei Yoyada ben Elyashiv, the Kohen HaGadol, was son-in-law to Sanvalat the Choroni; therefore I drove him away from me."
Nechemyah,13,29,"Remember them, O Elohai, because they have defiled the kehunah, and the brit (covenant) of the kehunah, and of the Levi'im."
Nechemyah,13,30,"Thus I cleansed them from all that is foreign, and had them attend again to the duties of the Kohanim and the Levi'im, every one in his appointed work;"
Nechemyah,13,31,"And for the korban of wood, at times appointed, and for the bikkurim. Remember me, O Elohai, for good."
