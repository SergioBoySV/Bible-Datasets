Melachim Alef,1,1,"Now HaMelech Dovid was zaken and stricken in yamim; and they covered him with begadim, but he could get no warmth."
Melachim Alef,1,2,"Wherefore his avadim said unto him, Let there be sought for adoni HaMelech a na'arah betulah; and let her stand before HaMelech, and let her care for him, and let her lie at thy kheyk (bosom) , that adoni HaMelech may be warm."
Melachim Alef,1,3,"So they sought for a na'arah yafeh throughout all the territory of Yisroel, and found Avishag HaShunammit, and brought her to HaMelech."
Melachim Alef,1,4,"And the na'arah was yafeh ad me'od, and cared for HaMelech, and waited on him; but HaMelech knew her not."
Melachim Alef,1,5,"Then Adoniyah Ben Chaggit put himself forward, saying, I will be Melech; and he prepared him merkavot and parashim, and chamishim ish to run before him."
Melachim Alef,1,6,"And Aviv had not rebuked him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? And he also was tov to'ar (good looking) ; and bore him after Avshalom."
Melachim Alef,1,7,"And he conferred with Yoav Ben Tzeruyah, and with Evyatar (Abiathar) HaKohen; and they lent ezer (help) , following after Adoniyah."
Melachim Alef,1,8,"But Tzadok HaKohen, and Benayah Ben Yehoyada, and Natan HaNavi, and Shime'i, and Re'i, and the Gibborim which belonged to Dovid, were not with Adoniyah."
Melachim Alef,1,9,"And Adoniyah sacrificed tzon and bakar and fatted bull at the Zochelet Even (Stone of Zoheleth) , which is Ein-Rogel, and invited all his achim, the Bnei HaMelech, and all the anshei Yehudah who were avadim of HaMelech;"
Melachim Alef,1,10,"But Natan HaNavi, and Benayah, and the Gibborim, and Sh'lomo his brother, he invited not."
Melachim Alef,1,11,"Wherefore Natan spoke unto Bat-Sheva em Sh'lomo, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adoniyah Ben Chaggit became Melech, and Dovid adoneinu knoweth it not?"
Melachim Alef,1,12,"Therefore come, let me, now, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own nefesh, and the nefesh of thy ben Sh'lomo."
Melachim Alef,1,13,"Go and get thee in unto HaMelech Dovid, and say unto him, Didst not thou, adoni, O HaMelech, swear unto thine amah (maid servant, handmaid) saying, Assuredly Sh'lomo thy ben shall reign as Melech after me, and he shall sit upon my kisse? Why then doth Adoniyah reign as Melech?"
Melachim Alef,1,14,"Hinei, while thou yet speakest there with HaMelech, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy devarim."
Melachim Alef,1,15,And Bat-Sheva went in unto HaMelech into the cheder; and HaMelech was zaken me'od; and Avishag HaShunammit attended unto HaMelech.
Melachim Alef,1,16,"And Bat-Sheva bowed, and did obeisance unto HaMelech. And HaMelech said, What wouldest thou?"
Melachim Alef,1,17,"And she said unto him, Adoni, thou didst swear by Hashem Eloheicha unto thine amah, saying, Assuredly Sh'lomo thy ben shall reign as Melech after me, and he shall sit upon my kisse."
Melachim Alef,1,18,"And now, hinei, Adoniyah reigneth as Melech; and now, adoni HaMelech, thou knowest it not;"
Melachim Alef,1,19,"And he hath sacrificed shor and fatted bull and tzon in abundance, and hath invited all the Bnei HaMelech, and Evyatar (Abiathar) HaKohen, and Yoav the Sar HaTzava; but Sh'lomo thy eved hath he not invited."
Melachim Alef,1,20,"And thou, adoni HaMelech, the eyes of kol Yisroel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the kisse adoni HaMelech after him."
Melachim Alef,1,21,"Otherwise it shall come to pass, when adoni HaMelech shall lie with his avot, that I and beni (my son) Sh'lomo shall be counted chatta'im."
Melachim Alef,1,22,"And, hinei, while she yet was speaking with HaMelech, Natan HaNavi also came in."
Melachim Alef,1,23,"And they told HaMelech, saying, Hinei Natan HaNavi! And when he was come in before HaMelech, he bowed himself before HaMelech with his face to the ground."
Melachim Alef,1,24,"And Natan said, Adoni HaMelech, hast thou said, Adoniyah shall reign as Melech after me, and he shall sit upon my kisse?"
Melachim Alef,1,25,"For he has gone down this day, and hath sacrificed shor and fatted bull and tzon in abundance, and hath invited all the Bnei HaMelech, and the sarei hatzava, and Evyatar (Abiathar) HaKohen; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, Yechi HaMelech Adoniyahu (long live HaMelech Adoniyah)!"
Melachim Alef,1,26,"But me, even me thy eved, and Tzadok HaKohen, and Benayah Ben Yehoyada, and thy eved Sh'lomo, hath he not invited."
Melachim Alef,1,27,"Is this thing done by adoni HaMelech, and thou hast not showed it unto thy eved, even who should sit on the kisse adoni HaMelech after him?"
Melachim Alef,1,28,"Then HaMelech Dovid answered and said, Call me Bat-Sheva. And she came into the presence of HaMelech, and stood before HaMelech."
Melachim Alef,1,29,"And HaMelech swore a shevu'a (oath) , and said, As Hashem liveth, that hath redeemed my nefesh out of kol tzarah,"
Melachim Alef,1,30,"Even as I swore a shevu'a unto thee by Hashem Elohei Yisroel, saying, Assuredly Sh'lomo thy ben shall reign as Melech after me, he shall sit upon my kisse in my place; so will I certainly do this day."
Melachim Alef,1,31,"Then Bat-Sheva bowed with her face to eretz, and did reverence to HaMelech, and said, Yechi adoni HaMelech Dovid l'olam (long live adoni HaMelech forever)!"
Melachim Alef,1,32,"And HaMelech Dovid said, Call me Tzadok HaKohen, and Natan HaNavi, and Benayah Ben Yehoyada. And they came before HaMelech."
Melachim Alef,1,33,"HaMelech also said unto them, Take with you the avadim of adoneichem, and have Sh'lomo beni (my son) to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gichon;"
Melachim Alef,1,34,"And let Tzadok HaKohen and Natan HaNavi mashach (anoint) him there Melech over Yisroel; and blow ye with the shofar, and say, Yechi HaMelech Sh'lomo."
Melachim Alef,1,35,"Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my kisse; for he shall be Melech in my place; and I have appointed him to be Nagid (ruler) over Yisroel and over Yehudah."
Melachim Alef,1,36,"And Benayah Ben Yehoyada answered HaMelech, and said, Omein; And so may Hashem Elohei adoni HaMelech say."
Melachim Alef,1,37,"As Hashem hath been with adoni HaMelech, even so may He be with Sh'lomo, and make his kisse greater than the kisse of adoni HaMelech Dovid."
Melachim Alef,1,38,"So Tzadok HaKohen, and Natan HaNavi, and Benayah Ben Yehoyada, and the Kereti, and the Peleti, went down, and had Sh'lomo ride upon the mule of HaMelech Dovid, and brought him to Gichon."
Melachim Alef,1,39,"And Tzadok HaKohen took a keren of shemen out of the ohel, and mashach (anointed) Sh'lomo. And they blew the shofar; and kol HaAm shouted, Yechi HaMelech Sh'lomo!"
Melachim Alef,1,40,"And kol HaAm came up after him, and the people played chalilim (flutes) , and rejoiced with simchah gedolah, so that ha'aretz split with the sound of them."
Melachim Alef,1,41,"And Adoniyah and kol hakeru'im (all the invited ones) that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Yoav heard the kol hashofar, he said, Why is the sound of the Ir in an uproar?"
Melachim Alef,1,42,"And while he yet spoke, hinei, Yonatan Ben Evyatar (Abiathar) HaKohen came; and Adoniyah said unto him, Come, for thou art an ish chayil, and tov tevaser (bringest good tidings)."
Melachim Alef,1,43,"And Yonatan answered and said to Adoniyah, Just the opposite! Verily adoneinu HaMelech Dovid hath made Sh'lomo Melech!"
Melachim Alef,1,44,"And HaMelech hath sent with him Tzadok HaKohen, and Natan HaNavi, and Benayah Ben Yehoyada, and the Kereti, and the Peleti, and they have had him ride upon pirdah (mule) of HaMelech:"
Melachim Alef,1,45,"And Tzadok HaKohen and Natan HaNavi have anointed him Melech at Gichon; and they are come up from there rejoicing, so that the city rang out. This is the noise that ye have heard."
Melachim Alef,1,46,And also Sh'lomo sitteth on the kisse hameluchah.
Melachim Alef,1,47,"And moreover the avadim of HaMelech came to make a brocha on adoneinu HaMelech Dovid, saying, May your G-d make the shem of Sh'lomo more famous than thy shem, and make his kisse greater than thy kisse. And HaMelech bowed himself upon the mishkav (bed)."
Melachim Alef,1,48,"Also so said HaMelech, Baruch Hashem Elohei Yisroel, Who hath given one to sit on my kisse this day, mine eyes even seeing it."
Melachim Alef,1,49,"And kol hakeruvim (all the invited ones) that were with Adoniyah were terrified, and rose up, and went every ish his own derech."
Melachim Alef,1,50,"And Adoniyah feared because of Sh'lomo, and arose, and went, and caught hold of the karnayim of the Mizbe'ach."
Melachim Alef,1,51,"And it was told Sh'lomo, saying, Hinei, Adoniyah feareth HaMelech Sh'lomo; for, hinei, he hath caught hold of the karnayim of the Mizbe'ach, saying, Let Melech Sh'lomo swear a shevua (oath) unto me today that he will not slay his eved with the cherev."
Melachim Alef,1,52,"And Sh'lomo said, If he will show himself a ben chayil (a son of worthiness) , there shall not a hair of him fall to ha'aretz; but if ra'ah (wickedness) shall be found in him, he shall die."
Melachim Alef,1,53,"So HaMelech Sh'lomo sent, and they brought him down from the Mizbe'ach. And he came and bowed himself to Melech Sh'lomo; and Sh'lomo said unto him, Go to thine bais."
Melachim Alef,2,1,"Now the days of Dovid drew near that he should die; and he charged Sh'lomo Bno, saying,"
Melachim Alef,2,2,"I go the derech kol ha'aretz; be thou chazak therefore, and show thyself a man;"
Melachim Alef,2,3,"And be shomer over the mishmeret (requirement, charge) of Hashem Eloheicha, to walk in His derakhim, to be shomer over His chukkot (decrees) , and His mitzvot, and His mishpatim (ordinances) , and His edot (testimonies) , as it is written in the Torat Moshe, so that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and wherever thou turnest;"
Melachim Alef,2,4,"So that Hashem may uphold His Davar (Word, Promise) which He spoke concerning me, saying, If thy banim are shomer over their derech, to walk before Me in emes with all their lev and with all their nefesh, there shall not yikaret l'cha (be cut off of you, fail thee) Ish on the Kisse Yisroel."
Melachim Alef,2,5,"Moreover thou knowest also what Yoav Ben Tzeruyah did to me, and what he did to the two sarim of the Tzivos Yisroel (Armies of Yisroel) , unto Avner Ben Ner, and unto Amasa Ben Yeter, whom he killed, and the shefach dahm of war in shalom (peacetime) , and put the dahm of milchamah (war) upon his khagorah (sword belt) that was about his loins, and on his na'alayim (sandals) that were on his raglayim."
Melachim Alef,2,6,"Do therefore according to thy chochmah, and let not his gray head go down to Sheol in shalom."
Melachim Alef,2,7,"But show chesed unto the Bnei Barzillai the Gil'adi, and let them be of those that eat at thy shulchan; for so they stood by me when I fled from before Avshalom achicha."
Melachim Alef,2,8,"And, hinei, thou hast with thee Shime'i Ben Gera the Ben-HaYemini of Bachurim, which cursed me with a kelalah (curse) nimretzet (grievous, strong) on the day when I went to Machanayim; but he came down to meet me at Yarden, and I swore a shevu'ah to him by Hashem , saying, I will not put thee to death with the cherev."
Melachim Alef,2,9,"Now therefore hold him not guiltless; for thou art an ish chacham, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his gray head bring thou down with dahm to She'ol."
Melachim Alef,2,10,"So Dovid slept with his avot, and was buried in Ir Dovid."
Melachim Alef,2,11,"And the yamim that Dovid reigned as Melech over Yisroel were arba'im shanah; sheva shanim reigned he in Chevron, and shloshim v'shalosh shanim reigned he in Yerushalayim."
Melachim Alef,2,12,Then sat Sh'lomo upon the Kisse Dovid Aviv; and Malchuso was firmly established.
Melachim Alef,2,13,"And Adoniyah Ben Chaggit came to Bat-Sheva Em Sh'lomo. And she said, Comest thou in shalom? And he said, Shalom."
Melachim Alef,2,14,"He said moreover, I have davar to say unto thee. And she said, Say on."
Melachim Alef,2,15,"And he said, Thou hast da'as that the meluchah (kingdom, monarchy) was mine, and that kol Yisroel set their faces on me, that I should reign as Melech; howbeit the meluchah has veered, and is become my brotherʼs; for it was his from Hashem."
Melachim Alef,2,16,"And now I ask thee one she'elah: refuse me not. And she said unto him, Say on."
Melachim Alef,2,17,"And he said, Speak, now, unto Sh'lomo HaMelech, (for he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Avishag HaShunammit as isha."
Melachim Alef,2,18,"And Bat-Sheva said, Tov; I will speak for thee unto HaMelech."
Melachim Alef,2,19,"Bat-Sheva therefore went unto HaMelech Sh'lomo, to speak unto him for Adoniyah. And HaMelech rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his kisse, and caused a kisse to be set for Em HaMelech; and she sat on his yamin (right hand)."
Melachim Alef,2,20,"Then she said, I desire one small she'elah of thee; now, say me not nay. And HaMelech said unto her, Ask on, immi: for I will not say thee nay."
Melachim Alef,2,21,"And she said, Let Avishag HaShunammit be given to Adoniyah thy brother as isha."
Melachim Alef,2,22,"And HaMelech Sh'lomo answered and said unto immo, And why dost thou request Avishag HaShunammit for Adoniyah? Ask for him the meluchah also; for he is achi hagadol; even for him, for Evyatar HaKohen, and for Yoav Ben Tzeruyah."
Melachim Alef,2,23,"Then HaMelech Sh'lomo swore a shevu'a by Hashem , saying, Elohim do so to me, and more also, if Adoniyah have not spoken this davar against his own nefesh."
Melachim Alef,2,24,"Now therefore, Hashem Chai (as Hashem liveth) , which hath established me, and set me on the Kisse Dovid Avi, and who hath made me a Bayit ([Davidic] Dynasty) , as He promised, Adoniyah shall be executed this day."
Melachim Alef,2,25,And HaMelech Sh'lomo sent by the yad Benayah Ben Yehoyada; and he struck him that he died.
Melachim Alef,2,26,"And unto Evyatar (Abiathar) HaKohen said HaMelech, Get thee to Anatot, unto thine own sadot; for ish mavet atah (You are a man deserving of death) ; but I will not this day put thee to death, because thou borest the Aron Adonoi Hashem before Dovid Avi, and because thou hast shared hardship in all wherein Avi endured hardship."
Melachim Alef,2,27,"So Sh'lomo thrust out Evyatar (Abiathar) from being Kohen unto Hashem ; in order to fulfill the Devar Hashem , which He had spoken at Shiloh concerning the Bais Eli."
Melachim Alef,2,28,"Then news came to Yoav; for Yoav had inclined after Adoniyah, though he turned not to take sides with Avshalom. And Yoav fled unto the Ohel Hashem , and caught hold the karnot HaMizbe'ach."
Melachim Alef,2,29,"And it was told Melech Sh'lomo that Yoav was fled unto the Ohel Hashem ; and, hinei, he is beside the Mizbe'ach. Then Sh'lomo sent Benayah Ben Yehoyada, saying, Go, fall upon him."
Melachim Alef,2,30,"And Benayah came to the Ohel Hashem , and said unto him, Thus saith HaMelech, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benayah brought HaMelech word again, saying, Thus said Yoav, and thus he answered me."
Melachim Alef,2,31,"And HaMelech said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away from me the demei chinnam (innocent blood) , the shefach dahm of Yoav, even from against the Bais Avi."
Melachim Alef,2,32,"And Hashem shall return his dahm upon his own rosh, who fell upon two anashim more tzaddikim and tovim than he, and killed them with the cherev, Dovid Avi not knowing thereof: Avner Ben Ner, Sar Tzava Yisroel, and Amasa Ben Yeter, Sar Tzava Yehudah."
Melachim Alef,2,33,"Let their dahm therefore turn back upon the rosh Yoav, and upon the rosh of his zera l'olam; but upon Dovid, and upon his Zera, and upon his Bais, and upon his Kisse, let there be shalom ad olam from Hashem."
Melachim Alef,2,34,"So Benayah Ben Yehoyada went up, and fell upon him, and executed him; and he was buried in his bais (house), in the midbar."
Melachim Alef,2,35,And in his place HaMelech put Benayah Ben Yehoyada in charge of the Tzava (Army) ; and Tzadok HaKohen did HaMelech put in the place of Evyatar.
Melachim Alef,2,36,"And HaMelech sent and summoned Shime'i, and said unto him, Build thee a bayit in Yerushalayim, and dwell there, and go not go out from there anywhere."
Melachim Alef,2,37,"For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest over the Kidron Valley, thou shalt know for certain that mot tamut (thou shalt surely die) ; thy dahm shall be upon thine own rosh."
Melachim Alef,2,38,"And Shime'i said unto HaMelech, Tov HaDavar (good is the word) ; just as adoni HaMelech hath said, so will thy eved do. And Shime'i dwelt in Yerushalayim yamim rabbim."
Melachim Alef,2,39,"And it came to pass at the end of shalosh shanim, that two of the avadim of Shime'i ran away unto Akhish Ben Ma'achah Melech Gat. And they told Shime'i, saying, Hinei, thy avadim are in Gat."
Melachim Alef,2,40,"And Shime'i arose, and saddled his chamor, and went to Gat to Akhish to search for his avadim; and Shime'i went, and brought back his avadim from Gat."
Melachim Alef,2,41,"And it was told Sh'lomo that Shime'i had gone from Yerushalayim to Gat, and had returned."
Melachim Alef,2,42,"And HaMelech sent and summoned Shime'i, and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear a shevu'ah by Hashem , and adjured thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the yom thou goest out, and walkest abroad any place whatever that mot tamut (thou shalt surely die) ? And thou saidst unto me, Tov HaDavar Sha'ma'ti (The good word I will hear, I will obey)."
Melachim Alef,2,43,"Why then hast thou not been shomer over the Shevuat Hashem , and the Mitzvah that I have charged thee with?"
Melachim Alef,2,44,"HaMelech said moreover to Shime'i, Thou knowest all the ra'ah which thine lev is privy to, that thou didst to Dovid Avi; therefore Hashem shall return thy ra'ah upon thine own rosh;"
Melachim Alef,2,45,"And HaMelech Sh'lomo baruch, and the Kisse Dovid shall be nakhon (secure) before Hashem ad olam."
Melachim Alef,2,46,"So HaMelech commanded Benayah Ben Yehoyada, who went and fell upon him, that he died. The mamlachah was established in the yad Sh'lomo."
Melachim Alef,3,1,"And Sh'lomo made an alliance with Pharaoh Melech Mitzrayim, and took Bat Pharaoh as isha, and brought her to Ir Dovid, until he had completed building his Bais (palace) , and also the Beis Hashem , and the surrounding chomat Yerushalayim."
Melachim Alef,3,2,"However HaAm were sacrificing in the high places, because there was no Bayit built unto the Shem of Hashem in those days."
Melachim Alef,3,3,"And Sh'lomo loved Hashem , walking in the chukkot Dovid Aviv; however he was sacrificing and burning ketoret at the high places."
Melachim Alef,3,4,And HaMelech went to Giv'on to sacrifice there; for that was the bamah hagedolah (the great high place) ; a thousand olot did Sh'lomo offer upon that mizbe'ach.
Melachim Alef,3,5,"In Giv'on Hashem appeared to Sh'lomo in a chalom halailah; Elohim said, Ask what I should give thee."
Melachim Alef,3,6,"And Sh'lomo said, Thou hast showed unto Thy eved Dovid Avi chesed gadol (great mercy) , according as he walked before Thee in emes, and in tzedakah, and in yesharah levav (uprightness of heart) with Thee; and Thou hast been shomer to preserve this chesed hagadol for him, that Thou hast given him ben to sit on his kisse, as is this day."
Melachim Alef,3,7,"And now, Hashem Elohai, Thou hast made Thy eved Melech in the place of Dovid Avi; and I am but a na'ar katon (little child) ; I know not how to go out or come in."
Melachim Alef,3,8,"And Thy eved is in the midst of Thy people which Thou hast chosen, an Am Rav, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude."
Melachim Alef,3,9,"Give therefore Thy eved a lev shome'a (discerning heart, mind) to govern Thy people, that I may discern between tov and rav; for who is sufficient to judge this Thy so great a people?"
Melachim Alef,3,10,"And the davar was pleasing in the eyes of Adonoi, that Sh'lomo had made request of this davar."
Melachim Alef,3,11,"And Elohim said unto him, Because thou hast made request of this davar, and hast not requested for thyself yamim rabbim; neither hast requested osher for thyself, nor hast requested the nefesh of thine oyevim; but hast requested for thyself binah to comprehend mishpat;"
Melachim Alef,3,12,"Hinei, I have done according to thy devarim; hinei, I have given thee a discerning lev chacham; so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee."
Melachim Alef,3,13,"And I have also given thee that which thou hast not requested, both osher, and kavod; so that there shall not be any among the Melachim like unto thee all thy yamim."
Melachim Alef,3,14,"And if thou wilt walk in My derakhim, to be shomer over My chukkot and My mitzvot, as Dovid Avicha did walk, then I will lengthen thy yamim."
Melachim Alef,3,15,"And Sh'lomo awoke; and, hinei, it was a chalom! And he returned to Yerushalayim, and stood before the Aron Brit Adonoi, and offered up olot, and offered shelamim, and made a mishteh (feast) for all his avadim."
Melachim Alef,3,16,"Then came there two nashim, that were zonot (harlots, prostitutes) unto HaMelech, and stood before him."
Melachim Alef,3,17,"And the one isha said, O adoni, I and this isha dwell in one bayit; and I was delivered of child with her babayit (in the house)."
Melachim Alef,3,18,"And it came to pass the Yom HaShelishi after that I was delivered, that this isha was delivered also: and we were together; there was no zar (stranger, outsider) with us babayit, except we two babayit."
Melachim Alef,3,19,And this ben haisha died in the lailah; because she had lain upon him.
Melachim Alef,3,20,"And she arose in the middle of the lailah, and took beni (my son) from beside me, while thine amah (handmaid) slept, and laid it in her kheyk (bosom) , and laid her ben hamet (dead son) in my kheyk."
Melachim Alef,3,21,"And when I rose in the boker to nurse beni, hinei, met! (dead!) But when I had examined him in the boker, hinei, he was not beni I bore!"
Melachim Alef,3,22,"And the isha ha'acheret (other woman) said, Lo (no) ; but hachai (the living) is beni (my son) , and hamet (the dead) is the ben of yours. But this one said, Lo (no) , the ben of yours is hamet (the dead [one]) , and beni is hachai! Thus they went on arguing before HaMelech!"
Melachim Alef,3,23,"Then said HaMelech, The one saith, This is beni (my son) hachai (the living [one]) , and thy ben is hamet (the dead [one]) ; and the other saith, Lo; but the ben of yours is hamet, and beni is hachai."
Melachim Alef,3,24,"And HaMelech said, Bring me a cherev. And they brought the cherev before HaMelech."
Melachim Alef,3,25,"And HaMelech said, Cut the yeled hachai in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other."
Melachim Alef,3,26,"Then spoke unto HaMelech the isha whose was the ben hachai, for her rachamim yearned for her ben, and she said, O adoni, give her the yeled hachai, and in no wise put him to death. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but cut him in two!"
Melachim Alef,3,27,"Then HaMelech answered and said, Give her the yeled hachai, and in no wise put him to death; she is immo (his mother)."
Melachim Alef,3,28,"And kol Yisroel heard of the mishpat (judgment) in which HaMelech had given verdict; and they feared HaMelech; for they saw that the chochmat Elohim was within him, to administer mishpat (justice)."
Melachim Alef,4,1,So HaMelech Sh'lomo was Melech over kol Yisroel.
Melachim Alef,4,2,"And these were the sarim which he had; Azaryah Ben Tzadok HaKohen,"
Melachim Alef,4,3,"Elichoreph and Achiyah, the Bnei Shisha, Sofrim (scribes) ; Yehoshaphat Ben Achilud, the Mazkir (secretary)."
Melachim Alef,4,4,And Benayah Ben Yehoyada was over the Tzava (army) ; and Tzadok and Evyatar (Abiathar) were the Kohanim;
Melachim Alef,4,5,And Azaryah Ben Natan was over the Nitzavim (commissioners) and Zavud Ben Natan kohen re'eh HaMelech;
Melachim Alef,4,6,And Achishar was over the Bais (palace) ; and Adoniram Ben Avda was over the forced labor.
Melachim Alef,4,7,"And Sh'lomo had twelve Nitzavim (commissioners) over kol Yisroel, which provided provision for HaMelech and his Bais (palace) ; each man his month in a shanah (year) made provision."
Melachim Alef,4,8,"And these are their shemot; Ben-Chur, in har Ephrayim;"
Melachim Alef,4,9,"Ben-Deker in Makatz, and in Sha'albim, and Beit-Shemesh, and Elon Beit-Chanan;"
Melachim Alef,4,10,"Ben-Chesed, in Arubot; to him pertained Sokhoh, and kol Eretz Chepher;"
Melachim Alef,4,11,"Ben-Avinadav, in kol Naphat Dor; which had Taphat Bat Sh'lomo as his isha;"
Melachim Alef,4,12,"Ba'ana Ben Achilud; Ta'nakh and Megiddo, and kol Beit-She'an, which is near Tzartan below Yizre'el (Jezreel) , from Beit-She'an to Avel-Mecholah, even unto beyond Yokme'am;"
Melachim Alef,4,13,"Ben-Gever, in Ramot Gil'ad; to him pertained the towns of Yair Ben Menasheh, which are in Gil'ad; to him also pertained the region of Argov, which is in Bashan, threescore arim gedolim with chomah and gate bars of nechoshet;"
Melachim Alef,4,14,Achinadav Ben Iddo had Machanayim;
Melachim Alef,4,15,Achima'atz was in Naphtali; he also took Basmat Bat Sh'lomo as his isha;
Melachim Alef,4,16,Ba'ana Ben Chushai was in Asher and in Alot;
Melachim Alef,4,17,"Yehoshaphat Ben Paruach, in Yissakhar;"
Melachim Alef,4,18,"Shime'i Ben Elah, in Binyamin;"
Melachim Alef,4,19,"Gever Ben Uri was in Eretz Gil'ad, in Eretz Sichon Melech Emori, and of Og Melech HaBashan; and he was the only Netziv (commissioner) which was in the land."
Melachim Alef,4,20,"Yehudah and Yisroel were many, as the chol (sand) which is by the yam in multitude, eating and drinking, and rejoicing."
Melachim Alef,4,21,"And Sh'lomo reigned as Melech over kol hamamlechot (all the kingdoms) from the Nahar ([Euphrates] River) unto Eretz Pelishtim (Philistines) , and unto the border of Mitzrayim: they brought minchah (tribute) , and served Sh'lomo all the days of his life."
Melachim Alef,4,22,"And Lechem Sh'lomo for one day was thirty kor of solet (fine flour) , and threescore kor of flour,"
Melachim Alef,4,23,"Ten stall fed bakar, and twenty bakar out of the pastures, and a hundred tzon, beside deer, and gazelle, and roebuck, and choice fowl."
Melachim Alef,4,24,"For he had dominion over all the region beyond the Nahar, from Tiphsach even to Azah (Gaza) , over all the melachim beyond the Nahar; and he had shalom on all sides around him."
Melachim Alef,4,25,"And Yehudah and Yisroel dwelt securely, every ish under his gefen and under his te'enah (fig tree) , from Dan even to Be'er-Sheva, all the days of Sh'lomo."
Melachim Alef,4,26,"And Sh'lomo had forty thousand stalls of susim for his merkavot, and twelve thousand parashim."
Melachim Alef,4,27,"And these Nitzavim provided for HaMelech Sh'lomo, and for all that came near unto Shulchan HaMelech Sh'lomo, every ish in his chodesh; they lacked nothing."
Melachim Alef,4,28,"Se'orim (barley) also and straw for the susim and swift steeds brought they unto the makom (place) where it should be, each according to his mishpat (charge, quota, duty, responsibility)."
Melachim Alef,4,29,"And Elohim gave Sh'lomo chochmah and tevunah (understanding, insight) exceeding much, and rochav lev (largeness of heart) , even as the chol (sand) that is on the seashore."
Melachim Alef,4,30,And the chochmah Sh'lomo excelled the chochmat kol Bnei Kedem and kol chochmat Mitzrayim.
Melachim Alef,4,31,"For he was wiser than kol Adam; than Eitan the Ezrachi, and Heman, and Kalkol, and Darda, the Bnei Machol; and shmo was in kol HaGoyim all around."
Melachim Alef,4,32,And he uttered three thousand mashal; and his shir (songs) were one thousand and five.
Melachim Alef,4,33,"And he spoke of etzim (trees) , from the erez (cedar tree) that is in the Levanon even unto the ezov (hyssop) which grows out of the wall; he spoke also of behemah (animal) , and of oph (fowl, bird) , and of remes (crawling creature) , and of dagim (fish)."
Melachim Alef,4,34,"And there came of kol Amim to hear the chochmat Sh'lomo, from kol Malkhei Ha'Aretz, which had heard of his chochmah."
Melachim Alef,5,1,And Chiram Melech Tzor sent his avadim unto Sh'lomo; for he had heard that they had anointed him Melech in the place of his av; for Chiram was ever an ohev (friend) of Dovid.
Melachim Alef,5,2,"And Sh'lomo sent to Chiram, saying,"
Melachim Alef,5,3,"Thou knowest how that Dovid Avi could not build Bayit unto the Shem of Hashem Elohav due to the milchamah which was about him on every side, until Hashem put them under the kappot (soles) of his raglayim."
Melachim Alef,5,4,"But now Hashem Elohai hath given me rest on every side, so that there is neither satan (adversary) nor pega rah (evil occurrence, misfortune)."
Melachim Alef,5,5,"And, now behold, I purpose to build a Beis for the Shem of Hashem Elohai, just as Hashem spoke unto Dovid Avi, saying, Binecha whom I will set upon thy Kisse in thy place, he shall build HaBayit for My Shem."
Melachim Alef,5,6,"Now therefore command thou that they cut for me arazim (cedar trees) out of the Levanon; and my avadim shall be with thy avadim; and unto thee will I give sachar (wage) for thy avadim according to all that thou shalt appoint; for thou knowest that there is not among us any that are skilled to hew etzim (wood, timber) like unto the Tzidonim."
Melachim Alef,5,7,"And it came to pass, when Chiram heard the divrei Sh'lomo, that he rejoiced with simchah me'od, and said, Baruch Hashem this day, Who hath given unto Dovid a ben chacham over HaAm Harav hazeh (this great people)."
Melachim Alef,5,8,"And Chiram sent to Sh'lomo, saying, I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for; and I will do all thy chefetz (desire) concerning atzei arazim (cedar timber) , and concerning atzei b'roshim (cypress wood)."
Melachim Alef,5,9,"My avadim shall bring them down from the Levanon unto the yam (sea), and I will convey them by yam on rafts unto the makom (place) that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive them; and thou shalt accomplish my chefetz (desire) , in giving lechem for my bais (household)."
Melachim Alef,5,10,So Chiram gave Sh'lomo atzei arazim (cedar logs) and atzei b'roshim (cypress wood) according to all his chefetz.
Melachim Alef,5,11,"And Sh'lomo gave Chiram twenty thousand kor of chittim (wheat) for provision for his bais, and twenty kor of shemen katit (pressed olive oil) : thus gave Sh'lomo to Chiram shanah b'shanah."
Melachim Alef,5,12,"And Hashem gave Sh'lomo chochmah, just as He promised him; and there was shalom between Chiram and Sh'lomo; and they had a brit (treaty, a political alliance) , the two of them."
Melachim Alef,5,13,And HaMelech Sh'lomo conscripted mas (forced labor) out of kol Yisroel; and the mas was thirty thousand ish.
Melachim Alef,5,14,"And he sent them to the Levanon, ten thousand a month by chalifot (courses, shifts) ; a month they were in the Levanon, and two months they were b'bayit (at home) ; and Adoniram was in charge of the mas."
Melachim Alef,5,15,"And Sh'lomo had threescore and ten thousand that were burden bearers, and fourscore thousand who were stone cutters in the har (mountains);"
Melachim Alef,5,16,"This was in addition to the chief of Sh'lomoʼs Nitzavim, who were over the project, three thousand three hundred, who supervised the people that wrought in the work."
Melachim Alef,5,17,"And HaMelech commanded, and avanim gedolot (great stones) they quarried, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the Bayit with hewn stones."
Melachim Alef,5,18,"And the Bonei Sh'lomo and Bonei Chiram did chisel them, and the men from Geval; so they prepared etzim (timber) and avanim (stones) to build the Bayit."
Melachim Alef,6,1,"And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the Bnei Yisroel were come out of Eretz Mitzrayim, in the fourth year of Sh'lomoʼs reign over Yisroel, in the month Ziv, which is the second month, that he began to build the Beis Hashem."
Melachim Alef,6,2,"And the Beis which king Sh'lomo built for Hashem , the length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits."
Melachim Alef,6,3,"And the Ulam (Portico) in front of the Heikhal of the Beis, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the Beis; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof projecting in front of the Beis."
Melachim Alef,6,4,And for the Beis he made embrasures.
Melachim Alef,6,5,"And against the wall of the Beis he built chambers round about, against the walls of the Beis round about, both of the Heikhal and of the Debir; and he made chambers round about;"
Melachim Alef,6,6,"The lowest story was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad; for without in the wall of the Beis he made narrow ledges round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the Beis."
Melachim Alef,6,7,"And the Beis, when it was under construction, was built of stone made ready before it was brought there; so was neither hammer nor chisel nor any tool of iron heard in the Beis, while it was under construction."
Melachim Alef,6,8,"The door for the middle story was in the right side of the Beis; and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into the third."
Melachim Alef,6,9,"So he built the Beis, and finished it; and covered the Beis with beams and boards of cedar."
Melachim Alef,6,10,"And then he built chambers against all the Beis, five cubits high; and they rested on the Beis with timber of cedar."
Melachim Alef,6,11,"And the Devar Hashem came to Sh'lomo, saying,"
Melachim Alef,6,12,"Concerning this Beis which thou art building, if thou wilt walk in My statutes, and execute My judgments, and be shomer over all My mitzvot to walk in them; then will I perform My word (promise) with thee, which I spoke unto Dovid thy father;"
Melachim Alef,6,13,"And I will dwell among the Bnei Yisroel, and will not forsake My people Yisroel."
Melachim Alef,6,14,"So Sh'lomo built the Beis, and finished it."
Melachim Alef,6,15,"And he built the walls of the Beis within with boards of cedar, from the floor of the Beis to the rafters of the ceiling; and he covered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the Beis with planks of cypress."
Melachim Alef,6,16,"And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the Beis, from the floor to the rafters with boards of cedar; he even built them for it within, even for the Debir, even for the Kodesh HaKodashim."
Melachim Alef,6,17,"And the Beis, that is, the Heikhal in front of it, was forty cubits long."
Melachim Alef,6,18,And the cedar of the Beis within was carved with gourds and open flowers; all was cedar; there was no stone seen.
Melachim Alef,6,19,"And the Devir he prepared in the Beis within, to set there the Aron Brit Hashem."
Melachim Alef,6,20,"And the Devir was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof; and he overlaid it with pure zahav (gold) ; and so covered the mizbe'ach which was of cedar."
Melachim Alef,6,21,"So Sh'lomo overlaid the Beis within with pure zahav (gold) ; and he drew chains of zahav (gold) across, in front of the Devir; and he overlaid it with zahav."
Melachim Alef,6,22,"And the whole interior he overlaid with zahav (gold) , in order that kol haBeis be perfect; also the whole Mizbe'ach that belonged to the Devir he overlaid with zahav (gold)."
Melachim Alef,6,23,"And within the Devir he made two keruvim of olive wood, each ten cubits high."
Melachim Alef,6,24,"And five cubits was the one wing of the keruv, and five cubits the other wing of the keruv; from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits."
Melachim Alef,6,25,And the other keruv was ten cubits; both the keruvim were of one measure and one size.
Melachim Alef,6,26,"The height of the one keruv was ten cubits, and so was it of the other keruv."
Melachim Alef,6,27,"And he set the keruvim within the inner room; and they stretched forth the wings of the keruvim, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other keruv touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of HaBayit."
Melachim Alef,6,28,And he overlaid the keruvim with zahav (gold).
Melachim Alef,6,29,"And he carved all the walls of the Beis round about with carved figures of keruvim and palm trees and open flowers, within and without."
Melachim Alef,6,30,"And the floor of the Beis he overlaid with zahav (gold) , within and without."
Melachim Alef,6,31,And for the entering of the Devir he made doors of olive wood; the lintel and the five-sided door posts.
Melachim Alef,6,32,"The two doors also were of olive wood; and he carved upon them carvings of keruvim and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with zahav, and spread zahav upon the keruvim, and upon the palm trees."
Melachim Alef,6,33,So also made he for the entrance of the Heikhal four-sided door posts of olive wood.
Melachim Alef,6,34,"And the two doors were of cypress wood; the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding."
Melachim Alef,6,35,And he carved thereon keruvim and palm trees and open flowers; and covered them with zahav fitted upon the carved work.
Melachim Alef,6,36,"And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams."
Melachim Alef,6,37,"In the fourth year was the foundation of the Beis Hashem laid, in the month Ziv;"
Melachim Alef,6,38,"And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the Beis finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he sheva shanim (seven years) in building it."
Melachim Alef,7,1,"But Sh'lomo was building his own Bais (palace complex) thirteen years, and he finished all his Bais."
Melachim Alef,7,2,"He built also the Bais Ya'ar HaLevanon; the length thereof was a hundred cubits, and the width thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars."
Melachim Alef,7,3,"And it was roofed in erez (cedar) above the tzela'ot (chambers, side-rooms) upon the ammudim; there were forty-five, fifteen per row."
Melachim Alef,7,4,"And there were shekufim (windows) in three rows, and outlook was opposite outlook, shalosh pe'amim (three times)."
Melachim Alef,7,5,"And all the petachim and mezuzot were framed four-sided by beams; and outlook opposite outlook, shalosh pe'amim (three times)."
Melachim Alef,7,6,"And he made Ulam HaAmmudim (Hall of Pillars) ; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the width thereof thirty cubits: and the ulam (portico) was in front of them; and the other ammudim with the thick beam were before them."
Melachim Alef,7,7,"Then he made Ulam HaKisse where he would judge, even the Ulam HaMishpat; and it was covered with erez (cedar) from floor to floor."
Melachim Alef,7,8,"And his Bais (palace) where he dwelt which was in another khatzer (courtyard) inwards from the Ulam, was similar in workmanship. Sh'lomo made also a Bais for Bat Pharaoh, whom he had taken as isha, and the Bais (palace) he made was like this Ulam."
Melachim Alef,7,9,"All these were of expensive stone, according to the measure of hewed stones, filed with files, outside and inside, even from the foundation unto the ceiling, and from without to the Khatzer HaGedolah (the Great Court)."
Melachim Alef,7,10,"And the foundation was laid with expensive stones, even avanim gedolot, stones of 10 cubits, and stones of 8 cubits."
Melachim Alef,7,11,"And above were expensive avanim, after the measure of hewed stones, and cedars."
Melachim Alef,7,12,"And the Khatzer HaGedolah (Great Court) was formed of shaloshah — three courses of hewn stones, and a course of hewn cedar beams, as in the Beis Hashem ʼs Khatzer HaPenimit (Innermost Court) and for the Ulam HaBeis."
Melachim Alef,7,13,And HaMelech Sh'lomo sent and brought back Chiram from Tzor.
Melachim Alef,7,14,"He was ben isha almanah of the tribe of Naphtali, and aviv was an ish of Tzor, a khoresh nechoshet and he was filled with chochmah and tevanah, and da'as to work all works in nechoshet. And he came to HaMelech Sh'lomo, and wrought all his work."
Melachim Alef,7,15,"For he cast two ammudim of nechoshet, of 18 cubits high apiece; and a line of 12 cubits did compass either of them about."
Melachim Alef,7,16,"And he made two capitals of mutzak nechoshet (cast bronze) , to set upon the tops of the ammudim; the height of the one capital was 5 cubits, and the height of the other capital was 5 cubits:"
Melachim Alef,7,17,"And plaiting of net work, and ropes of chain work, for the capitals which were upon the top of the ammudim, seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital."
Melachim Alef,7,18,"And he made the ammudim, and two rows around the one network, to cover the capitals that were upon the rosh (top) with pomegranates; and the same did he for the second capital."
Melachim Alef,7,19,"And the capitals that were upon the rosh of the ammudim were of shushan (lily) work in the Ulam, four cubits."
Melachim Alef,7,20,"And the capitals upon the two ammudim had pomegranates also above, over against the bulge which was next to the network; and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows encircling the second capital."
Melachim Alef,7,21,"And he set up the ammudim in the Ulam HaHeikhal; and he set up the right ammud, and called shmo thereof Yachin (Establish) : and he set up the left ammud, and called shmo thereof Boaz (Strength is in it)."
Melachim Alef,7,22,And upon the top of the ammudim was shoshan (lily) work; so was the work of the ammudim completed.
Melachim Alef,7,23,"And he made a Yam Mutzak (Cast Metal Sea) , ten cubits from brim to brim; it was completely round and its height was 5 cubits; and a line of 30 cubits did measure around about it."
Melachim Alef,7,24,"And under the brim of it all around about there were knobs surrounding it, ten in a cubit, encompassing the Yam all around about; the knobs were cast in two rows, when it was cast."
Melachim Alef,7,25,"It stood upon twelve bakar (oxen) , shalosh looking toward tzafonah (north) , and shalosh looking toward the yammah (west) , and shalosh looking toward the negbah (south) , and shalosh looking toward the mizrachah (east) ; and the Yam was set above upon them, and all their haunches were facing toward the center."
Melachim Alef,7,26,"And it was a hand-breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a kos, with shoshan blossoms; it could hold two thousand bath measures."
Melachim Alef,7,27,"And he made ten Mekhonot (Stands) of nechoshet; four cubits was the length of one Stand, and four cubits the width thereof, and three cubits the height of it."
Melachim Alef,7,28,"And the constuction of the Mekhonot was on this manner: they had misgerot (panels, flat sides) , and the misgerot were between the shelabim (rods, upright braces);"
Melachim Alef,7,29,"And on the misgerot that were between the shelabim were [engraved] arayot (lions) and bakar (oxen) , and keruvim; and upon the shelabim there was a base above; and below the arayot and bakar were wreaths of plaited work."
Melachim Alef,7,30,"And every Mekhonah (Stand) had four nechoshet ofanim (wheels) , and axles of nechoshet; and the four corners thereof had supporting posts; under the Kiyor (Basin) were supports cast with wreaths on each side."
Melachim Alef,7,31,"And the mouth within the capital and above was a cubit; but the opening thereof was circular like the construction of the base, a cubit and an half; and also upon the rim of it were engravings. The frames were foursquare, not circular."
Melachim Alef,7,32,And under the frames were four ofanim (wheels) ; and the axles of the ofanim (wheels) were joined to the Mekhonah; and the diameter of each wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.
Melachim Alef,7,33,"And the construction of the ofanim (wheels) was like the construction of a merkavah ofan (wheel) : their axles, and their hubs, and their rims, and their spokes, were all cast metal."
Melachim Alef,7,34,And there were four supports to the four pinnot (corners) of each stand; and the supports were of the stand itself.
Melachim Alef,7,35,And at the top of the Mekhonah (Stand) was there a round rim of half a cubit high; and on the top of the Mekhonah (Stand) the rods thereof and the frames thereof were cast as one unit.
Melachim Alef,7,36,"For on the luchot of the rods thereof, and on the misgerot (panels) thereof, he engraved keruvim, arayot, and timorot (palms) , according to the proportion of every one, and wreaths all around."
Melachim Alef,7,37,"After this manner he made the ten Mekhonot; all of them had one casting, one middah (size) , and one shape."
Melachim Alef,7,38,Then made he ten kiyyorot nechoshet (basins of bronze) ; one kiyor could hold forty baths; and every kiyor was four cubits; and upon each of the ten Mekhonot there was one kiyor (basin).
Melachim Alef,7,39,"And he put five Mekhonot (Stands) on the right side of the Beis, and five on the left side of the Beis; and he set the Yam on the right side of the Beis eastward opposite the south."
Melachim Alef,7,40,"And Chiram made the kiyyrot, and the ya'im (shovels) , and the mizrakot (bowls for sprinkling blood) . So Chiram completed all the melachah (work) that he made for Sh'lomo HaMelech for the Beis Hashem;"
Melachim Alef,7,41,"The two ammudim, and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the two ammudim; and the two networks, decorating the two bowls of the capitals which were upon the top of the ammudim;"
Melachim Alef,7,42,"And four hundred rimonim (pomegranates) for the two networks, even two courses of rimonim (pomegranates) for one network, to decorate the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the ammudim;"
Melachim Alef,7,43,"And the ten Mekhonot (stands) , and ten Kiyyorot (basins) on the Mekhonot;"
Melachim Alef,7,44,"And one Yam, and twelve Bakar under the Yam;"
Melachim Alef,7,45,"And the sirot (pots) , and the ya'im (shovels) , and the mizrakot (bowls for sprinkling blood) ; and all these kelim (vessels) , which Chiram made for Sh'lomo HaMelech for the Beis Hashem were of burnished nechoshet."
Melachim Alef,7,46,"In the plain of the Yarden did HaMelech cast them, in the clay of the adamah (ground) between Sukkot and Tzartan."
Melachim Alef,7,47,"And Sh'lomo left all the kelim (vessels) unweighed, because they were exceeding many; neither was the weight of the nechoshet found out."
Melachim Alef,7,48,"And Sh'lomo made all the kelim (vessels) that pertained unto the Beis Hashem : the Mizbe'ach HaZahav, and the Shulchan HaZahav, whereupon was the Lechem HaPanim,"
Melachim Alef,7,49,"And the Menorot of pure zahav, five on the right side, and five on the left, in front of the Devir (Most Holy Place) , with floral designs, and the nerot (lamps) , and the melkachayyim (tongs) of zahav,"
Melachim Alef,7,50,"And the sippot (bowls) , and the mezammerot (lamp snuffers) , and the mizrakot (bowls for sprinkling blood) , and the kappot (ladles) , and the machtot zahav sagur (hot coal pans of pure gold) , and the gold potot (hinge-sockets) for the daletot (doors) of the Beis HaPenimi, the Kodesh HaKodashim, and also those for the daletot of the Beis, that is, the Heikhal."
Melachim Alef,7,51,"So was completed all the work that HaMelech Sh'lomo made for the Beis Hashem . And Sh'lomo brought in the things which Dovid Aviv had set apart as kodesh; even the kesef, and the zahav, and the kelim (vessels) , did he put among the otzarot (treasures) of the Beis Hashem."
Melachim Alef,8,1,"Then Sh'lomo assembled the Zekenim of Yisroel, and all the Rashei HaMattot, the Nesi'ei HaAvot of the Bnei Yisroel, unto HaMelech Sh'lomo in Yerushalayim, that they might bring up the Aron Brit Hashem out of Ir Dovid, which is Tziyon."
Melachim Alef,8,2,"And all the Ish Yisroel assembled themselves unto HaMelech Sh'lomo at the Chag in the month Etanim, which is the seventh month."
Melachim Alef,8,3,"And all the Zekenim of Yisroel came, and the Kohanim took up the Aron."
Melachim Alef,8,4,"And they brought up the Aron Hashem , and the Ohel Mo'ed and all the kelei hakodesh that were in the Ohel, even those did the Kohanim and the Levi'im carry up."
Melachim Alef,8,5,"And Sh'lomo HaMelech, and all the Adat Yisroel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the Aron, sacrificing tzon and bakar, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude."
Melachim Alef,8,6,"And the Kohanim brought in the Aron Brit Hashem unto its makom, in the Devir HaBayit, the Kodesh HaKodashim, even under the wings of the keruvim."
Melachim Alef,8,7,"For the keruvim spread forth their kenafayim (wings) over the place of the Aron, and the keruvim overshadowed the Aron and the poles thereof."
Melachim Alef,8,8,"They drew out the poles, that the ends of the poles were seen out in the Kodesh before the Devir, but they were not seen from the outside; there they are unto this day."
Melachim Alef,8,9,"There was nothing in the Aron except the two Luchot HaAvanim (Tablets of Stone) , which Moshe placed there at Chorev, when Hashem cut a Brit with the Bnei Yisroel, when they came out of Eretz Mitzrayim."
Melachim Alef,8,10,"And it came to pass, when the Kohanim were come out of the Kodesh, that the anan filled the Beis Hashem,"
Melachim Alef,8,11,So that the Kohanim could not stand up to minister because of the anan; for the Kavod Hashem had filled the Beis Hashem.
Melachim Alef,8,12,"Then spoke Sh'lomo, Hashem said that He would dwell in the thick cloud."
Melachim Alef,8,13,"I have surely built Thee a Beis of habitation, a Makhon for Thee to abide olamim."
Melachim Alef,8,14,"And HaMelech turned his face about, and made a brocha upon Kol Kehal Yisroel; (and Kol Kehal Yisroel were standing);"
Melachim Alef,8,15,"And he said, Baruch Hashem Elohei Yisroel, which spoke with His mouth unto Dovid Avi, and hath with His yad fulfilled it, saying,"
Melachim Alef,8,16,"Since the yom that I brought forth My people Yisroel out of Mitzrayim, I chose no ir out of all the Shivtei Yisroel to build a Beis, that Shemi might be therein; but I chose Dovid to be over My people Yisroel."
Melachim Alef,8,17,It was in the levav Dovid Avi to build Bayit for Shem Hashem Elohei Yisroel.
Melachim Alef,8,18,"And Hashem said unto Dovid Avi, Whereas it was in thine lev to build a Beis unto Shemi, thou didst well that it was in thine lev."
Melachim Alef,8,19,"Nevertheless thou shalt not build the Bayit; but thy ben that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the Bayit unto Shemi."
Melachim Alef,8,20,"And Hashem hath fulfilled His Davar that He spoke, and I am risen up in the place of Dovid Avi, and sit on the Kisse Yisroel, just as Hashem promised, and have built Bayit for the Shem Hashem Elohei Yisroel."
Melachim Alef,8,21,"And I have set there a Makom for the Aron, wherein is the Brit Hashem , which He cut with Avoteinu, when He brought them out of Eretz Mitzrayim."
Melachim Alef,8,22,"And Sh'lomo stood before the Mizbe'ach Hashem in the presence of all the Kahal Yisroel, and spread forth his palms toward Shomayim;"
Melachim Alef,8,23,"And he said, Hashem Elohei Yisroel, there is no Elohim like Thee, in Shomayim above, or on HaAretz beneath, who is shomer HaBrit and keeps chesed with Thy avadim that walk before Thee with all their lev;"
Melachim Alef,8,24,"Who hast been shomer with Thy eved Dovid Avi that Thou promised him; Thou spoke also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with Thine yad, as it is this day."
Melachim Alef,8,25,"Therefore now, Hashem Elohei Yisroel, be shomer with Thy eved Dovid Avi that Thou promised him, saying, There shall not Yikaret (be cut off, fail) thee an ish in My sight to sit on the Kisse Yisroel; so that thy banim be shomer over their derech, that they walk before Me as thou hast walked before Me."
Melachim Alef,8,26,"And now, O Elohei Yisroel, let Thy davar now come true, which Thou spoke unto Thy eved Dovid Avi."
Melachim Alef,8,27,"But will Elohim indeed dwell on ha'aretz? Hinei, the Shomayim and the Shemei HaShomayim cannot contain Thee; how much less this Bayit that I have built?"
Melachim Alef,8,28,"Yet turn Thou unto the tefillah of Thy eved, and to his techinnah, Hashem Elohai, to pay heed unto the cry and to the tefillah, which Thy eved is davening before Thee today;"
Melachim Alef,8,29,"That Thine eyes may be open toward this Bayit lailah va'yom, even toward the Makom of which Thou hast said, Shemi shall be there; that Thou mayest pay heed unto the tefillah which Thy eved shall make toward Makom Hazeh."
Melachim Alef,8,30,"And pay heed Thou to the techinnah of Thy eved, and of Thy people Yisroel, when they shall daven toward Makom Hazeh; and hear Thou from Shomayim Thy dwelling place; and when Thou hearest, forgive."
Melachim Alef,8,31,"If any ish trespass against his neighbor, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before Thine Mizbe'ach in this Bayit;"
Melachim Alef,8,32,"Then hear Thou in Shomayim, and do, and judge Thy avadim, condemning the rasha, to bring his derech upon his rosh; and lehatzeddik (justifying, declaring innocent and acquitted) the tzaddik, to give him according to his tzedakah."
Melachim Alef,8,33,"When Thy people Yisroel be struck down before the oyev, because they have sinned against Thee, and shall turn back to Thee, and confess Thy Shem, and daven, and make supplication unto Thee in this Bayit:"
Melachim Alef,8,34,"Then hear Thou in Shomayim, and forgive the chattat of Thy people Yisroel, and bring them back unto HaAdamah which Thou gavest unto their Avot."
Melachim Alef,8,35,"When Shomayim is shut up, and there is no matar (rain) , because they have sinned against Thee; if they daven toward this Makom, and confess Thy Shem, and turn from their chattat, when Thou afflictest them;"
Melachim Alef,8,36,"Then hear Thou in Shomayim, and forgive the chattat of Thy avadim, and of Thy people Yisroel, that Thou teach them the Derech Hatovah wherein they should walk, and give matar (rain) upon Thy Land, which Thou hast given to Thy people for a nachalah."
Melachim Alef,8,37,"If there be in HaAretz ra'av, if there be dever, blight, mildew, arbeh, or if there be grasshopper; if their oyev besiege them in the eretz of their she'arim; whatsoever nega (plague) , whatsoever machalah (disease) there be;"
Melachim Alef,8,38,"What tefillah and techinnah be made by any adam, or by all Thy people Yisroel, which shall know every man the nega of his own levav, and spread forth his palms toward this Bayit;"
Melachim Alef,8,39,"Then hear Thou in Shomayim the Makom of Thy dwelling, and forgive, and do, and give to every ish according to his derech, whose lev Thou knowest; (for Thou, even Thou only, knowest levav kol Bnei HaAdam);"
Melachim Alef,8,40,That they may fear Thee all hayamim that they are chayyim in the adamah which Thou gavest unto Avoteinu.
Melachim Alef,8,41,"Moreover concerning a nokhri (foreigner) , that is not of Thy people Yisroel, but cometh out of a far country for Thy Nameʼs sake;"
Melachim Alef,8,42," (For they shall hear of Thy Shem HaGadol, and of Thy Yad HaChazakah, and of Thy stretched out zero'a;) and shall come and daven toward this Bayit;"
Melachim Alef,8,43,"Hear Thou in Shomayim the Makom of Thy dwelling, and do according to all that the nokhri calleth to Thee for; that all peoples of ha'aretz may know Thy Shem, to fear Thee, as do Thy people Yisroel; that they may know that this Bayit, which I have built, is called by Thy Shem."
Melachim Alef,8,44,"If Thy people go out to milchamah against their oyev (enemy) , in the derech that Thou shalt send them, and shall daven unto Hashem in the Derech HaIr which Thou hast chosen, and toward the Bayit that I have built for Thy Shem;"
Melachim Alef,8,45,"Then hear Thou in Shomayim their tefillah and their techinnah, and uphold their mishpat."
Melachim Alef,8,46,"If they sin against Thee, (for there is no adam that sinneth not) , and Thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the oyev (enemy) , so that they carry them away captives unto the eretz of the oyev, far or near;"
Melachim Alef,8,47,"Yet if they make in their lev teshuvah in HaAretz where they were carried captives, and turn, and make techinnah unto Thee in the eretz of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness;"
Melachim Alef,8,48,"And so return unto Thee with all their lev, and with all their nefesh, in the eretz of their enemies, which led them away captive, and daven unto Thee in the derech (direction) of their land, which Thou gavest unto their Avot, the Ir which Thou hast chosen, and the Bayit which I have built for Thy Shem;"
Melachim Alef,8,49,"Then hear Thou their tefillah and their techinnah in Shomayim, the Makom of Thy dwelling, and uphold their cause,"
Melachim Alef,8,50,"And forgive Thy people that have sinned against Thee, and all their peysha'im wherein they have rebelled against Thee, and give them rachamim before them who carried them captive, that they may have rachamim on them;"
Melachim Alef,8,51,"For they are Thy people, and Thine nachalah, which Thou broughtest forth out of Mitzrayim, from the midst of the Kur HaBarzel (Furnace of Iron):"
Melachim Alef,8,52,"That Thine eyes may be open unto the techinnah of Thy eved, and unto the techinnah of Thy people Yisroel, to pay heed unto them in all that they call for unto Thee."
Melachim Alef,8,53,"For Thou didst separate them from among all the peoples of HaAretz, to be Thine nachalah, as Thou spoke by the yad Moshe Thy Eved, when Thou broughtest Avoteinu out of Mitzrayim, Adonoi Hashem,"
Melachim Alef,8,54,"And it was so, that when Sh'lomo had completed davening all this tefillah and techinnah unto Hashem , he arose from before the Mizbe'ach Hashem , from having knelt on his knees with his palms spread up to Shomayim."
Melachim Alef,8,55,"And he stood, and made on Kol Kehal Yisroel a brocha with a kol gadol (loud voice) , saying,"
Melachim Alef,8,56,"Baruch Hashem , that hath given menuchah unto His people Yisroel, according to all that He promised: there hath not failed one davar of all His good promise, which He promised by yad Moshe His Eved."
Melachim Alef,8,57," Hashem Eloheinu be immanu (with us) , as He was with Avoteinu; let Him not leave us, nor forsake us;"
Melachim Alef,8,58,"That He may incline levavenu (our hearts) unto Him, to walk in all his ways, and to be shomer over His mitzvot, and His chukkot, and His mishpatim, which He commanded Avoteinu."
Melachim Alef,8,59,"And let these my words, wherewith I have made techinnah before Hashem , be kerovim (near ones) unto Hashem Eloheinu yomam valailah that He maintain the mishpat (cause) of His eved, and the mishpat of His people Yisroel at all times, as each day requires;"
Melachim Alef,8,60,That all the peoples of ha'aretz may know that Hashem hu HaElohim and that there is none else.
Melachim Alef,8,61,"Let your lev therefore be shalem with Hashem Eloheinu, to walk in His chukkot, to be shomer over His mitzvot, as at this day."
Melachim Alef,8,62,"And HaMelech, and kol Yisroel with him, offered zevach (sacrifice) before Hashem."
Melachim Alef,8,63,"And Sh'lomo offered a zevach hashelamim (sacrifice of peace offerings) , which he offered unto Hashem , two and twenty thousand bakar, and a hundred and twenty thousand tzon (sheep) . So HaMelech and kol Bnei Yisroel dedicated the Beis Hashem."
Melachim Alef,8,64,"The same day did HaMelech consecrate as kodesh the interior of the Khatzer (Court) that was before the Beis Hashem ; for there he offered olah and minchah, and the chelvei hashelamim because the Mitzbe'ach HaNechoshet that was before Hashem was too katon (small) to receive the olah, and minchah, and the chelvei hashelamim."
Melachim Alef,8,65,"And at that time Sh'lomo observed a Chag, and kol Yisroel with him, a Kahal Gadol, from the Approach of Chamat unto the Wadi Mitzrayim, before Hashem Eloheinu, shivat yamim and shivat yamim, even arba'a asar yom."
Melachim Alef,8,66,"On the Yom HaShemini he sent away the people and they made on HaMelech a brocha, and went unto their ohalim joyful and glad of lev for all hatovah (the goodness) that Hashem had done for Dovid His Eved and for Yisroel His People."
Melachim Alef,9,1,"And it came to pass, when Sh'lomo had completed the building of the Beis Hashem , and the Bais HaMelech, and all Sh'lomoʼs desire which he was pleased to do,"
Melachim Alef,9,2,"That Hashem appeared to Sh'lomo the second time, as He had appeared unto him at Giv'on."
Melachim Alef,9,3,"And Hashem said unto him, I have heard thy tefillah and thy techinnah, that thou hast made before Me; I have set apart as kodesh this Beis, which thou hast built, to put Shemi there ad olam; and Mine eyes and Mine lev shall be there kol hayamim."
Melachim Alef,9,4,"And if thou wilt walk before Me, just as Dovid Avicha walked, in tohm (integrity, guilelessness) of lev, and in yashar, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and will be shomer over My chukkot and My mishpatim;"
Melachim Alef,9,5,"Then I will establish the kisse (throne) of thy kingdom over Yisroel l'olam, as I promised to Dovid Avicha, saying, There shall not yikaret (be cut off, fail) thee an ish upon the Kisse Yisroel."
Melachim Alef,9,6,"But if ye shall at all turn from following Me, ye or your banim, and will not be shomer over My mitzvot and My chukkot which I have set before you, but go and serve elohim acherim, and hishtachaveh (worship) them;"
Melachim Alef,9,7,"Then will I cut off Yisroel out of the adamah which I have given them; and this Beis, which I have set apart as kodesh for Shemi, will I cast out of My sight; and Yisroel shall be a mashal (proverb) and a sheninah (taunt, byword) among kol ha'ammim;"
Melachim Alef,9,8,"And at this Beis, which is elyon, every one that passeth by it shall be appalled, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath Hashem done thus unto HaAretz Hazot, and to this Beis?"
Melachim Alef,9,9,"And they shall answer, Because they forsook Hashem Eloheichem who brought forth their avot out of Eretz Mitzrayim, and have taken hold upon elohim acherim, and have worshiped them, and served them; therefore hath Hashem brought upon them all this ra'ah."
Melachim Alef,9,10,"And it came to pass at the end of esrim shanim, when Sh'lomo had built the two batim, the Beis Hashem , and the Bais HaMelech,"
Melachim Alef,9,11," (Now Chiram Melech Tzor had furnished Sh'lomo with cedar trees and cypress trees, and with zahav, according to all his desire) , that then HaMelech Sh'lomo gave Chiram esrim ir (twenty towns) in Eretz HaGalil."
Melachim Alef,9,12,And Chiram came out from Tzor (Tyre) to see the towns which Sh'lomo had given him; and they pleased him not.
Melachim Alef,9,13,"And he said, What towns are these which thou hast given me, achi (my brother) ? And he called them Eretz Kavul unto this day."
Melachim Alef,9,14,And Chiram sent to HaMelech 120 talents of zahav.
Melachim Alef,9,15,"And this is the account of the mas (forced labor) which HaMelech Sh'lomo conscripted; to build the Beis Hashem , and his own Bais, and Millo, and the Chomat Yerushalayim, and Chatzor, and Megiddo, and Gezer."
Melachim Alef,9,16,"For Pharaoh Melech Mitzrayim had gone up, and captured Gezer, and burned it with eish, and slain the Kena'ani that dwelt in the ir, and given it for shilluchim (going-away presents) unto his bat eshet Sh'lomo."
Melachim Alef,9,17,"And Sh'lomo rebuilt Gezer, and Lower Beit-Choron,"
Melachim Alef,9,18,"And Ba'alat, and Tadmor in the midbar, in the land,"
Melachim Alef,9,19,"And all the storage cities that Sh'lomo had, and cities for his merkavot, and cities for his parashim (calvary) , and that which Sh'lomo desired to build in Yerushalayim, and in Levanon, and in all the eretz of his memshalet."
Melachim Alef,9,20,"And kol haAm that were left of HaEmori (the Amorites) , HaChitti (Hittites) , HaPerizzi (Perizzites) , HaChivi (Hivites) , and Yevusi (Jebusites) , which were not of the Bnei Yisroel,"
Melachim Alef,9,21,"Their banim that were left after them in HaAretz, whom the Bnei Yisroel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Sh'lomo conscript mas of oved (bondservice) unto this day."
Melachim Alef,9,22,"But of the Bnei Yisroel did Sh'lomo make no eved; but they were anshei hamilchamah, and his avadim, and his sarim, and his shalishim (captains) , and commanders of his merkavot, and his parashim."
Melachim Alef,9,23,"These were the chief of the officials that were over the melachah (work) of Sh'lomo five hundred and fifty, harodim (the ones supervising) the people that wrought in the melachah."
Melachim Alef,9,24,But Bat Pharaoh came up out of the Ir Dovid unto her Bais (Palace) which Sh'lomo had built for her; then did he build the Millo.
Melachim Alef,9,25,And three times in shanah did Sh'lomo offer olot and shelamim upon the Mizbe'ach which he built unto Hashem and he burned ketoret upon the Mizbe'ach that was before Hashem . So he completed the Beis.
Melachim Alef,9,26,"And HaMelech Sh'lomo built a fleet of oniyyot in Etzyon-Gever, which is near Eilot, on the shore of the Yam Suf, in Eretz Edom."
Melachim Alef,9,27,"And Chiram sent to the fleet of oniyyot his avadim, anshei oniyyot (shipmen, sailors) that had da'as hayam (knowledge of the sea) , with the avadim of Sh'lomo."
Melachim Alef,9,28,"And they came to Ophir, and brought back from there zahav, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to HaMelech Sh'lomo."
Melachim Alef,10,1,"And when the Malkah (Queen) of Sheva heard of the fame of Sh'lomo, that it was for the Shem Hashem , then she came to test him with chidot (hard questions, riddles)."
Melachim Alef,10,2,"And she came to Yerushalayim with a very great caravan, with gemalim that bore spices, and very much zahav, and precious gems; and when she was come to Sh'lomo, she spoke intimately with him of all that was on her lev."
Melachim Alef,10,3,"And Sh'lomo answered her regarding all her questions; there was not anything hid from HaMelech, which he told her not."
Melachim Alef,10,4,"And when the Malkah of Sheva had seen kol chochmat Sh'lomo, and the Bais (Palace) that he had built,"
Melachim Alef,10,5,"And the ma'akhal (food) of his shulchan, and the moshav (seating) of his avadim (officials) , and the ma'amad (station) of his attendants, and their robes, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the Beis Hashem ; there was no more ruach (breath) in her."
Melachim Alef,10,6,"And she said to HaMelech, It was emes the report that I heard in mine own eretz of thy devarim and of thy chochmah."
Melachim Alef,10,7,"Howbeit I believed not the devarim, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it; and, hinei, the half was not told me; thy chochmah and tov (prosperity) exceedeth the fame which I heard."
Melachim Alef,10,8,"Ashrei are thy anashim; ashrei are these thy avadim, which stand continually before thee, and that hear thy chochmah."
Melachim Alef,10,9,"Yehi Hashem Eloheicha baruch Who delighted in thee, to set thee on the Kisse Yisroel; because Hashem loved Yisroel l'olam, therefore made He thee Melech, to do mishpat and tzedakah."
Melachim Alef,10,10,"And she gave HaMelech a hundred and twenty talents of zahav, and a very large store of spices and precious gems; there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the Malkah of Sheva gave to Melech Sh'lomo."
Melachim Alef,10,11,"And the fleet of oniyyot also of Chiram, that brought zahav from Ophir, brought in from Ophir a vast supply of almug wood, and precious gems."
Melachim Alef,10,12,"And HaMelech made of the almug wood misad (steps, support) for the Beis Hashem , and for the Bais HaMelech, kinnorot (harps) also and nevalim (lyres) for the singers; there came no such almug wood, nor were seen unto this day."
Melachim Alef,10,13,"And HaMelech Sh'lomo gave unto the Malkah of Sheva all her desire, whatsoever she asked, besides that which Sh'lomo gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her avadim."
Melachim Alef,10,14,"Now the weight of zahav that came to Sh'lomo in one year was 666 talents of zahav,"
Melachim Alef,10,15,"This was in addition to what he had of the anashei hatarim (merchants) , and of the income of traders, and of all the Melachim of Arabia, and of the Governors of the land."
Melachim Alef,10,16,And HaMelech Sh'lomo made two hundred large shields of hammered zahav; six hundred shekels of zahav went to one shield.
Melachim Alef,10,17,And he made three hundred moginim of hammered zahav; three mina of zahav went to one mogen (shield) ; and HaMelech put them in the Bais Ya'ar HaLevanon.
Melachim Alef,10,18,"Moreover HaMelech made a kisse shen gadol (great throne of ivory) , and overlaid it with the finest, brightest zahav."
Melachim Alef,10,19,"The kisse had shesh ma'alot (six steps) , and the top of the kisse was rounded; and there were armrests on either side on the makom (place) of the seat, and two arayot (lions) stood beside the armrests."
Melachim Alef,10,20,And twelve arayim (lions) stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps; there was not the like made in any mamlakhot (kingdoms).
Melachim Alef,10,21,"And all HaMelech Sh'lomoʼs kelei mashkeh (drinking vessels) were of zahav, and all the vessels of the Bais Ya'ar HaLevanon were of pure zahav; none were of kesef; it was nothing accounted of in the days of Sh'lomo."
Melachim Alef,10,22,"For HaMelech had at sea a fleet of oniyyot Tarshish with the fleet of oniyyot of Chiram; once in shalosh shanim came the fleet of oniyyot Tarshish, bringing zahav, and kesef, ivory, and monkeys, and peacocks."
Melachim Alef,10,23,So HaMelech Sh'lomo exceeded all the Melachim of Ha'Aretz in osher and in chochmah.
Melachim Alef,10,24,"And kol Ha'Aretz sought the face of Sh'lomo, to hear his chochmah, which Elohim had put in his lev."
Melachim Alef,10,25,"They brought every ish his minchah, vessels of kesef, vessels of zahav, and robes, and weapons, and spices, susim, and peradim (mules) , yearly at each yearʼs due."
Melachim Alef,10,26,"And Sh'lomo gathered together merkavot and parashim; and he had a thousand and four hundred merkavot, and twelve thousand parashim, whom he kept in his chariot cities and with HaMelech in Yerushalayim."
Melachim Alef,10,27,"And HaMelech made kesef to be in Yerushalayim like avanim (rocks) , and cedars made he to be like sycamores in the Shefelah, for abundance."
Melachim Alef,10,28,"And Sh'lomo had susim brought out of Mitzrayim, and from Keveh; HaMelechʼs agents acquired from Kevah at a price."
Melachim Alef,10,29,"And a merkavah (chariot) went out of Mitzrayim for six hundred pieces of kesef, and a sus for a hundred and fifty; and so for all the melachim of the Chittim (Hittites) , and for the melachim of Aram, did they export them by the same means."
Melachim Alef,11,1,"But Sh'lomo Hamelech loved nashim nokhriyyot rabbot (many foreign women) , besides Bat Pharaoh: Moaviyyot, Ammoniyyot, Adomiyyot, Tzedeniyyot, Chittiyyot,"
Melachim Alef,11,2,"Of the Goyim concerning which Hashem said unto the Bnei Yisroel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in unto you; for surely they will turn away your levav after their elohim; Sh'lomo made his deveykus unto these in love."
Melachim Alef,11,3,"And he had nashim sarot sheva me'ot (seven hundred royal wives) , and three hundred pilagshim; and his nashim inclined libo (his heart)."
Melachim Alef,11,4,"For it came to pass, when Sh'lomo was old, that his nashim inclined libo (his heart) after elohim acherim and levavo (his heart) was not shalem (undivided, fully devoted, complete) with Hashem Elohav, as was the levav Dovid Aviv."
Melachim Alef,11,5,"For Sh'lomo went after Ashtoret elohei Tzidonim, and after Milkom shikkutz (the abomination of) Ammonim."
Melachim Alef,11,6,"And Sh'lomo did the rah in the sight of Hashem , and went not fully after Hashem , as did Dovid Aviv."
Melachim Alef,11,7,"Then did Sh'lomo build a high place for Kemosh, the shikkutz (abomination of) Moav, on the har (hill), that is facing Yerushalayim, and for Molech, the shikkutz (abomination of) the Bnei Ammon."
Melachim Alef,11,8,"And likewise did he for all his nashim nokhriyyot, which burned ketoret and offered zevakhim unto their elohim."
Melachim Alef,11,9,"And Hashem was angry with Sh'lomo, because levavo was turned from Hashem Elohei Yisroel, Who had appeared unto him twice,"
Melachim Alef,11,10,"And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after elohim acherim; but he was not shomer over that which Hashem commanded."
Melachim Alef,11,11,"Wherefore Hashem said unto Sh'lomo, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not been shomer over My Brit (Covenant, Sinai Covenant) and My chukkot, which I have commanded thee, I will surely tear away the Mamlachah from thee, and will give it to thy eved (servant)."
Melachim Alef,11,12,Notwithstanding in thy yamim I will not do it lema'an (for the sake of) Dovid Avicha; but I will tear it out of the yad binecha (power of thy son).
Melachim Alef,11,13,Howbeit I will not tear away kol hamamlachah; but will give shevet echad (one tribe) to binecha le'ma'an Dovid Avdi and lema'an Yerushalayim which I have chosen.
Melachim Alef,11,14,"And Hashem raised up satan (adversary) unto Sh'lomo, Hadad HaAdomi; he was from the zera HaMelech in Edom."
Melachim Alef,11,15,"For it came to pass, when Dovid was in Edom, and Yoav Sar HaTzava was gone up to bury the slain, after he had struck down every zachar in Edom;"
Melachim Alef,11,16,"(For six months did Yoav remain there with kol Yisroel, until he had cut off every zachar in Edom);"
Melachim Alef,11,17,"That Hadad fled, he and anashim Adomiyyim (certain men of Edom) of his fatherʼs avadim with him, to go into Mitzrayim; Hadad being yet a na'ar katan (small child)."
Melachim Alef,11,18,"And they arose out of Midyan, and came to Paran; and they took anashim with them out of Paran, and they came to Mitzrayim, unto Pharaoh Melech Mitzrayim; who gave him a bais, and assigned him lechem, and gave him eretz."
Melachim Alef,11,19,"And Hadad found chen me'od in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him for an isha the achot of his own isha, the achot Tachpeneis the gevirah (royal lady, queen)."
Melachim Alef,11,20,"And the achot of Tachpeneis bore him Genuvat bno, whom Tachpeneis weaned in Bais Pharaoh; and Genuvat was in Bais Pharaoh among the Bnei Pharaoh."
Melachim Alef,11,21,"And when Hadad heard in Mitzrayim that Dovid slept with Avotav, and that Yoav Sar HaTzava was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own eretz."
Melachim Alef,11,22,"Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, hinei, thou seekest to go to thine own eretz? And he answered, Nothing; howbeit let me go anyway."
Melachim Alef,11,23,"And Elohim raised up against him another satan, Rezon ben Elyada, which fled from adonav Hadadezer Melech Tzovah;"
Melachim Alef,11,24,"And he gathered anashim unto him, and became sar gedood (leader of a band of marauders) , when Dovid slaughtered them of Tzovah; they went to Damascus, dwelt therein, and reigned he there as king."
Melachim Alef,11,25,"And he was a satan to Yisroel all the days of Sh'lomo, in addition to ra'ah that Hadad did; and he despised Yisroel, and he ruled in Aram."
Melachim Alef,11,26,"Also the eved Sh'lomo Yarov'am ben Nevat, an Ephrati of the Tzeredah (Zeredah) , whose shem immo was Tzeru'ah, an almanah, even he lifted up his yad against HaMelech."
Melachim Alef,11,27,"And this is the account of his lifting up his yad against HaMelech; Sh'lomo built the Millo, and closed up the peretz of Ir Dovid Aviv."
Melachim Alef,11,28,"And the ish Yarov'am was a gibbor chayil; and Sh'lomo seeing the na'ar that he was industrious, he put him over all the sevel (load, burden, enforced labor) of Bais Yosef."
Melachim Alef,11,29,"And it came to pass at that time when Yarov'am went out of Yerushalayim, that HaNavi Achiyah the Shiloni found him on the derech; and he had clothed himself with a salmah chadasha (new garment, cloak) ; and they two were alone in the sadeh;"
Melachim Alef,11,30,"And Achiyah took hold of the salmah chadasha that was on him, and tore it into twelve pieces;"
Melachim Alef,11,31,"And he said to Yarov'am, Take for thee ten pieces; for thus saith Hashem Elohei Yisroel, Hineni, I will tear the mamlachah out of the yad Sh'lomo, and will give to thee asarah hashevatim."
Melachim Alef,11,32,"(But he shall have hashevet haechad l'ma'an Dovid Avdi, and l'ma'an Yerushalayim, the Ir which I have chosen out of kol shivtei Yisroel;)"
Melachim Alef,11,33,"Because that they have forsaken Me, and have worshiped Ashtoret elohei Tzidonim, Kemosh elohei Moav, and Milkom elohei Bnei Ammon, and have not walked in My ways, to do that which is yashar in Mine eyes, and My chukkot and My mishpatim, as did Dovid Aviv."
Melachim Alef,11,34,"Howbeit I will not take the whole mamlachah out of his yad; but I will make him nasi all the days of his life l'ma'an Dovid Avdi, whom I chose, because he was shomer over My mitzvot and My chukkot;"
Melachim Alef,11,35,"But I will take the mamlachah out of yad beno, and will give it unto thee, even aseret hashevatim (ten tribes)."
Melachim Alef,11,36,"And unto bno will I give shevet echad (one tribe) , l'ma'an Dovid Avdi may have a ner (lamp) always before Me in Yerushalayim, the Ir which I have chosen for Me to put My Shem there."
Melachim Alef,11,37,"And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy nefesh desireth, and shalt be Melech over Yisroel."
Melachim Alef,11,38,"And it shall be, if thou wilt pay heed unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in My ways, and do that is yashar in My sight, to be shomer over My chukkot and My mitzvot, as Dovid Avdi did; that I will be with thee, and build thee a bais ne'eman (enduring dynasty) as I built for Dovid, and will give Yisroel unto thee."
Melachim Alef,11,39,"And I will for this afflict the zera Dovid, but not forever."
Melachim Alef,11,40,"Sh'lomo sought therefore to kill Yarov'am. And Yarov'am arose, and fled into Mitzrayim, unto Shishak Melech Mitzrayim, and was in Mitzrayim until the Mot Sh'lomo."
Melachim Alef,11,41,"And the rest of the acts of Sh'lomo, and all that he did, and his chochmah, are they not written in the Sefer Divrei Sh'lomo?"
Melachim Alef,11,42,And the time that Sh'lomo reigned in Yerushalayim over kol Yisroel was arba'im shanah.
Melachim Alef,11,43,"And Sh'lomo slept with Avotav, and was buried in the Ir Dovid Aviv: and Rechav'am bno reigned in his place."
Melachim Alef,12,1,And Rechav'am went to Shechem; for kol Yisroel were come to Shechem to make him Melech.
Melachim Alef,12,2,"And it came to pass, when Yarov'am Ben Nevat, who was yet in Mitzrayim, heard of it, (for he had fled from the presence of HaMelech Sh'lomo, and Yarov'am dwelt in Mitzrayim);"
Melachim Alef,12,3,"That they sent and called him. And Yarov'am and kol Kehal Yisroel came, and spoke unto Rechav'am, saying,"
Melachim Alef,12,4,"Avicha made our ol (yoke) difficult; now therefore make thou the grievous avodat Avicha, and his heavy ol (yoke) which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee."
Melachim Alef,12,5,"And he said unto them, Depart yet for shloshah yamim, then come back to me. And HaAm departed."
Melachim Alef,12,6,"And HaMelech Rechav'am consulted with the Zekenim, that stood before Sh'lomo Aviv while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may return answer to HaAm Hazeh?"
Melachim Alef,12,7,"And they spoke unto him, saying, If thou wilt be an eved unto this people today, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak devarim tovim to them, then they will be thy avadim kol hayamim."
Melachim Alef,12,8,"But he forsook the atzat HaZekenim (counsel of the Elders) , which they had given him, and consulted with the yeladim (young people) that were grown up with him, and which stood before him (i.e., were in his court);"
Melachim Alef,12,9,"And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may return answer to HaAm Hazeh, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the ol (yoke) which Avicha did put upon us lighter?"
Melachim Alef,12,10,"And the yeladim that were grown up with him spoke unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto HaAm hazeh that spoke unto thee, saying, Avicha made our ol (yoke) heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than the loins of Avi!"
Melachim Alef,12,11,"And now whereas Avi did lay on you an ol kaved (heavy yoke) , I will add to your ol (yoke) ; Avi hath scourged you with shotim (whips) , but I will scourge you with akrabim (scorpions)."
Melachim Alef,12,12,"So Yarov'am and kol HaAm came to Rechav'am the Yom HaShelishi, just as HaMelech had appointed, saying, Come to me again the Yom HaShelishi."
Melachim Alef,12,13,"And HaMelech answered HaAm roughly, and forsook the atzat HaZekenim (counsel of the Elders) that they gave him;"
Melachim Alef,12,14,"And spoke to them according to atzat HaYeladim, saying, Avi made your ol (yoke) heavy, and I will add to your ol (yoke) ; Avi also scourged you with shotim (whips) , but I will scourge you with akrabim."
Melachim Alef,12,15,"So HaMelech paid heed not unto HaAm; for the sibbah (turn of events) was from Hashem , in order that He might perform His davar, which Hashem spoke by Achiyah the Shiloni unto Yarov'am Ben Nevat."
Melachim Alef,12,16,"So when kol Yisroel saw that HaMelech paid heed not unto them, HaAm answered HaMelech, saying, What chelek have we in Dovid? Neither have we nachalah in Ben Yishai; to your ohalim, O Yisroel; now see to thine own Bais, Dovid. So Yisroel departed unto their ohalim."
Melachim Alef,12,17,"But as for the Bnei Yisroel which dwelt in the towns of Yehudah, Rechav'am reigned over them."
Melachim Alef,12,18,"Then HaMelech Rechav'am sent Adoram, who was over the mas (forced labor) ; and kol Yisroel stoned him, that he died. Therefore HaMelech Rechav'am made speed to get himself up to his merkavah, to flee to Yerushalayim."
Melachim Alef,12,19,So Yisroel has been in rebellion against the Bais Dovid unto this day.
Melachim Alef,12,20,"And it came to pass, when kol Yisroel heard that Yarov'am was come again, that they sent and called him unto the Edah, and made him melech over kol Yisroel; there was none that followed the Bais Dovid, but the Shevet Yehudah only."
Melachim Alef,12,21,"And when Rechav'am was come to Yerushalayim he assembled kol Bais Yehudah, with the Shevet Binyamin, a hundred and fourscore thousand bachur oseh milchamah (chosen fighting men) , to fight against Bais Yisroel, to regain the Kingdom for Rechav'am Ben Sh'lomo."
Melachim Alef,12,22,"But the Devar HaElohim came unto Shema'yah the Ish HaElohim, saying,"
Melachim Alef,12,23,"Speak unto Rechav'am Ben Sh'lomo Melech Yehudah, and unto kol Bais Yehudah and Binyamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying,"
Melachim Alef,12,24,"Thus saith Hashem , Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the Bnei Yisroel; Shuvu (go back! return!) every ish to his bais; for this thing is from Me. They paid heed therefore to the Devar Hashem , and turned around to depart, according to the Devar Hashem."
Melachim Alef,12,25,"Then Yarov'am built Shechem in har Ephrayim, and dwelt therein; and went out from there, and built Penuel."
Melachim Alef,12,26,"And Yarov'am said in his lev, Now shall the mamlachah return to the Bais Dovid:"
Melachim Alef,12,27,"If HaAm Hazeh go up to offer zevakhim (sacrifices) at the Beis Hashem at Yerushalayim, then shall lev HaAm Hazeh turn back unto adoneihem, even unto Rechav'am Melech Yehudah, and they shall kill me, and return to Rechav'am Melech Yehudah."
Melachim Alef,12,28,"Whereupon HaMelech took counsel, and made two eglei zahav (calves of gold) , and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Yerushalayim; hinei, eloheicha, O Yisroel, which brought thee up out of Eretz Mitzrayim."
Melachim Alef,12,29,"He set the one in Beit-El, the other put he in Dan."
Melachim Alef,12,30,"And this thing became chattat (sin) ; for the people went to worship before the one, even as far as Dan."
Melachim Alef,12,31,"And he made a bais for the high places, and made kohanim of the lowest of the people, which were not of the Bnei Levi."
Melachim Alef,12,32,"And Yarov'am ordained a chag in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the chag that is in Yehudah, and he offered upon the mizbe'ach. So did he in Beit-El, sacrificing unto the agalim (calves) that he had made; and he installed in Beit-El the kohanim of the high places which he had made."
Melachim Alef,12,33,"So he offered upon the mizbe'ach which he had made in Beit-El the fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own lev; and ordained a chag unto the Bnei Yisroel; and he offered upon the mizbe'ach, and burned ketoret."
Melachim Alef,13,1,"And, hinei, by the Devar Hashem there came an Ish HaElohim out of Yehudah unto Beit-El; and Yarov'am stood by the mizbe'ach to burn ketoret."
Melachim Alef,13,2,"And he cried against the mizbe'ach by the Devar Hashem , and said, O mizbe'ach, mizbe'ach, thus saith Hashem ; Hinei, ben nolad (a son shall be born) unto the Bais Dovid, Yoshiyah shmo; and upon thee shall he offer the kohanim of the high places that burn ketoret upon thee, and atzmot adam shall be burned upon thee."
Melachim Alef,13,3,"And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the mofet (sign) that Hashem hath spoken: Hinei, the mizbe'ach shall be split apart, and the deshen (fat ashes) that are upon it shall be poured out."
Melachim Alef,13,4,"And it came to pass, when HaMelech Yarov'am heard the davar of the Ish HaElohim, which had cried against the mizbe'ach in Beit-El, that he put forth his yad from the mizbe'ach, saying, Lay hold on him. And his yad, which he put forth against him, shriveled up, so that he could not draw it back to him."
Melachim Alef,13,5,"The mizbe'ach also was split apart, and the deshen poured out from the mizbe'ach, according to the mofet which the Ish HaElohim had given by the Devar Hashem."
Melachim Alef,13,6,"And HaMelech answered and said unto the Ish HaElohim, Intercede now before the face of Hashem Eloheicha, and daven for me, that my yad may be restored to me. And the Ish HaElohim made intercessory prayer before Hashem , and the yad HaMelech was restored to him, and became as it was before."
Melachim Alef,13,7,"And HaMelech said unto the Ish HaElohim, Come with me habaytah (home) , and have seudah, and I will give thee a mattat (gift)."
Melachim Alef,13,8,"And the Ish HaElohim said unto HaMelech, If thou wilt give me half thine bais, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat lechem nor drink mayim in this makom;"
Melachim Alef,13,9,"For so was it charged me by the Devar Hashem , saying, Eat no lechem, nor drink mayim, nor return again by the same derech that thou camest."
Melachim Alef,13,10,"So he went another derech, and returned not by the derech that he came to Beit-El."
Melachim Alef,13,11,"Now there dwelt a navi zaken (old prophet) in Beit-El; and his banim came and told him kol hama'aseh that the Ish HaElohim had done that day in Beit-El: the devarim which he had spoken unto HaMelech, them they told also to their av."
Melachim Alef,13,12,"And their av said unto them, What derech went he? For his banim had seen on what derech the Ish HaElohim, who came from Yehudah, went."
Melachim Alef,13,13,"And he said unto his banim, Saddle me the chamor. So they saddled him the chamor; and he rode thereon,"
Melachim Alef,13,14,"And went after the Ish HaElohim, found him sitting under the elah (the oak tree) ; and he said unto him, Art thou the Ish HaElohim that camest from Yehudah? And he said, I am."
Melachim Alef,13,15,"Then he said unto him, Come with me home, and eat lechem."
Melachim Alef,13,16,"And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee; neither will I eat lechem nor drink mayim with thee in this makom;"
Melachim Alef,13,17,"For it was told to me by the Devar Hashem , Thou shalt eat no lechem nor drink mayim there, nor turn again to go by the derech on which thou camest."
Melachim Alef,13,18,"He said unto him, I am a navi also as thou art; and a malach spoke unto me by the Devar Hashem , saying, Bring him back with thee into thine bais, that he may eat lechem and drink mayim. But he lied unto him."
Melachim Alef,13,19,"So he went back with him, did eat lechem in his bais and drank mayim."
Melachim Alef,13,20,"And it came to pass, as they sat at shulchan, that the Devar Hashem came unto the navi that brought him back;"
Melachim Alef,13,21,"And he cried unto the Ish HaElohim that came from Yehudah, saying, Thus saith Hashem , Forasmuch as thou hast defied the mouth of Hashem , and hast not been shomer over the mitzvah which Hashem Eloheicha commanded thee,"
Melachim Alef,13,22,"But camest back, and hast eaten lechem and drunk mayim in the makom, of the which Hashem did say to thee, Eat no lechem, drink no mayim; thy nevelah shall not come unto kever avoteicha."
Melachim Alef,13,23,"And it came to pass, after he had eaten lechem, and after he had drunk, that he saddled the chamor for him, for the navi whom he had brought back."
Melachim Alef,13,24,"And when he was gone, an aryeh met him by the derech, and killed him; and his nevelah was cast down in the derech, and the chamor stood beside her, and the aryeh also stood beside the nevelah."
Melachim Alef,13,25,"And, hinei, anashim passed by, and saw the nevelah cast down in the derech, and the aryeh standing beside the nevelah; and they came and told it in the Ir where the navi hazaken dwelt."
Melachim Alef,13,26,"And when the navi that brought him back from the derech heard thereof, he said, It is the Ish HaElohim, who defied the mouth of Hashem ; therefore Hashem hath delivered him unto the aryeh, which hath mauled him, and slain him, according to the Devar Hashem , which He spoke unto him."
Melachim Alef,13,27,"And he spoke to his banim, saying, Saddle me the chamor. And they saddled it."
Melachim Alef,13,28,"And he went and found his nevelah cast down in the derech, and the chamor and the aryeh standing beside the nevelah; the aryeh had not eaten the nevelah, nor mauled the chamor."
Melachim Alef,13,29,"The navi took up the nevelah of the Ish HaElohim, laid it upon the chamor, brought it back; and came to the Ir of the navi hazaken to mourn and to bury him."
Melachim Alef,13,30,"And he laid his nevelah in his own kever; and they mourned over him, saying, Hoy (alas) , achi (my brother)!"
Melachim Alef,13,31,"And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his banim, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the kever wherein the Ish HaElohim is buried; lay my atzmot beside his atzmot;"
Melachim Alef,13,32,"For the davar which he cried by the Devar Hashem against the mizbe'ach in Beit-El, and against all the batim of the high places which are in the cities of Shomron, shall surely come to pass."
Melachim Alef,13,33,"After this thing Yarov'am returned not from his derech har'ah, but installed again of the lowest of the people as kohanim of the high places; whosoever desired, he filled hands of him, and he became one of the kohanim of the high places."
Melachim Alef,13,34,"And this thing became chattat (sin) unto the Bais Yarov'am, even to annihilate it, and to destroy it from off the face of ha'adamah."
Melachim Alef,14,1,At that time Aviyah Ben Yarov'am fell sick.
Melachim Alef,14,2,"And Yarov'am said to his isha, Arise, now, and disguise thyself, that thou be not recognized to be eshet Yarov'am; and get thee to Shiloh; hinei, there is Achiyah HaNavi, which told me that I should be melech over this people."
Melachim Alef,14,3,"And take with thee asarah lechem, and nikkudim (wafers) , and a bakbuk (bottle) of devash, and go to him; he shall tell thee what shall become of the na'ar."
Melachim Alef,14,4,"And eshet Yarov'am did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the bais Achiyah. But Achiyah could not see; for his eyes had ceased by reason of his seiv (old age)."
Melachim Alef,14,5,"And Hashem said unto Achiyah, Hinei, the eshet Yarov'am cometh to seek davar from thee for her ben; for he is choleh (ill) ; thus and thus shalt thou give davar unto her; for it shall be, when she cometh in, that she shall feign to be a stranger woman."
Melachim Alef,14,6,"And it was so, when Achiyah heard the sound of her raglayim, as she came to the petach, that he said, Come in, thou eshet Yarov'am; why feignest thou to be a stranger woman? For I am sent to thee with kashah (a harsh prophetic foresight)."
Melachim Alef,14,7,"Go, tell Yarov'am, Thus saith Hashem Elohei Yisroel, Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee nagid over My people Yisroel,"
Melachim Alef,14,8,"And tore the Kingdom from the Bais Dovid, and gave it thee; and yet thou hast not been as Avdi Dovid, who was shomer over My mitzvot, and who followed after Me with all his lev, to do only yashar in Mine eyes;"
Melachim Alef,14,9,"But hast done rah more than all that were before thee; for thou hast gone and made for thee elohim acherim, and massekhot (metal idols) , to provoke Me to anger, and hast thrust Me behind thy gav (back);"
Melachim Alef,14,10,"Therefore, hineni, I will bring ra'ah upon the Bais Yarov'am, and will cut off from Yarov'am mashtin b'kir (him that urinates against the wall), atzur (bond) or azuv (free) in Yisroel, and I will sweep out after the Bais Yarov'am just as one sweepeth out the dung, till it be all gone."
Melachim Alef,14,11,Him that dieth of Yarov'am in the Ir shall the kelavim (dogs) eat; and him that dieth in the sadeh shall the oph haShomayim eat; for Hashem hath spoken.
Melachim Alef,14,12,"Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own bais; and when thy raglayim enter into the Ir (city), the yeled shall die."
Melachim Alef,14,13,"And kol Yisroel shall mourn for him, and bury him; for he only of Yarov'am shall come to the kever (grave) , because in him there is found some davar tov (good thing) toward Hashem Elohei Yisroel in the Bais Yarov'am."
Melachim Alef,14,14,"Moreover Hashem shall raise Him up a Melech over Yisroel, who shall cut off the Bais Yarov'am even this day. This is the day! Even now."
Melachim Alef,14,15,"For Hashem shall strike Yisroel, just as the kaneh (reed) , is shaken in the mayim, and He shall uproot Yisroel out of this adamah hatovah, which He gave to Avoteihem, and shall scatter them beyond the Nahar (River), because they have made their Asherah idols, provoking Hashem to anger."
Melachim Alef,14,16,"And He shall give up Yisroel because of the chattot Yarov'am, who did sin, and who made Yisroel to sin."
Melachim Alef,14,17,"And eshet Yarov'am arose, and departed, and came to Tirtzah; and when she came to the saf HaBayit (the treshold of the house) , the na'ar died."
Melachim Alef,14,18,"And they buried him; and kol Yisroel mourned for him, according to the Devar Hashem , which He spoke by the yad of his eved Achiyah HaNavi."
Melachim Alef,14,19,"And the rest of the acts of Yarov'am, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the Sefer Divrei HaYamim L'Malkhei Yisroel."
Melachim Alef,14,20,"And the yamim (days) which Yarov'am reigned were two and twenty shanah; and he slept with his avot, and Nadav bno reigned in his place."
Melachim Alef,14,21,"And Rechav'am Ben Sh'lomo reigned in Yehudah. Rechav'am was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Yerushalayim, the Ir which Hashem did choose out of kol Shivtei Yisroel, to put Shmo there. And shem immo was Na'amah HaAmmonit (an Ammonitess)."
Melachim Alef,14,22,"And Yehudah did the rah in the eyes of Hashem , and they provoked Him to kina (jealousy) with their chattot which they had committed, which were more than all that their avot had done."
Melachim Alef,14,23,"For they also built them high places, and matzevot (idol images) , and Asherim on every high hill, and under every thickly foliaged green tree."
Melachim Alef,14,24,And there were also kadesh (male and female cult prostitutes) in the land; and they did according to all the to'avot (abominations) of the Goyim which Hashem drove out before the Bnei Yisroel.
Melachim Alef,14,25,"And it came to pass in the fifth year of Melech Rechav'am, that Shishak Melech Mitzrayim came up against Yerushalayim;"
Melachim Alef,14,26,"And he carried away the otzarot of the Beis Hashem , and the otzarot of the Bais HaMelech; he even carried away everything: and he carried away all the moginnim (shields) of zahav which Sh'lomo had made."
Melachim Alef,14,27,"And Melech Rechav'am made in their place moginnim of nechoshet, and committed them unto the hands of the commanders of the guard, which were the shomrim at the petach of the Bais HaMelech."
Melachim Alef,14,28,"And it was so, when HaMelech went into the Beis Hashem , that those on guard duty bore them, and brought them back into the guard room."
Melachim Alef,14,29,"Now the rest of the acts of Rechav'am, and all that he did, are they not written in the Sefer Divrei HaYamim L'Malkhei Yehudah?"
Melachim Alef,14,30,And there was milchamah between Rechav'am and Yarov'am all their yamim (days).
Melachim Alef,14,31,"And Rechav'am slept with his avot, and was buried with his avot in Ir Dovid. And the shem immo was Na'amah HaAmmonit (an Ammonite) . And Aviyam bno reigned in his place."
Melachim Alef,15,1,Now in the eighteenth year of Melech Yarov'am Ben Nevat reigned Aviyam over Yehudah.
Melachim Alef,15,2,Shalosh shanim reigned he in Yerushalayim. And shem immo was Ma'achah Bat Avishalom.
Melachim Alef,15,3,"And he walked in all the chattot Aviv, which he had done before him; and his lev was not shalem (fully devoted) to Hashem Elohav, as the levav Dovid Aviv."
Melachim Alef,15,4,"Nevertheless l'ma'an Dovid (for the sake of Dovid) did Hashem Elohav give him a ner (lamp) in Yerushalayim, to raise up Bno after him, and to establish Yerushalayim;"
Melachim Alef,15,5,"Because Dovid did that which was yashar in the eyes of Hashem , and turned not aside from any thing that He commanded him all the days of his life, except only in the matter of Uriyah HaChitti (the Hittite)."
Melachim Alef,15,6,And there was milchamah between Rechav'am and Yarov'am all the days of his life.
Melachim Alef,15,7,"Now the rest of the acts of Aviyam, and all that he did, are they not written in the Sefer Divrei HaYamim L'Malkhei Yehudah? And there was milchamah between Aviyam and Yarov'am."
Melachim Alef,15,8,And Aviyam slept with his avot; and they buried him in Ir Dovid; and Asa Bno reigned in his place.
Melachim Alef,15,9,"And in the twentieth year of Yarov'am Melech Yisroel, Asa began to reign as Melech over Yehudah."
Melachim Alef,15,10,And forty and one years reigned he in Yerushalayim. And shem immo was Ma'achah Bat Avishalom.
Melachim Alef,15,11,"And Asa did that which was yashar in the eyes of Hashem , as did Dovid Aviv."
Melachim Alef,15,12,"And he removed kedeshim (the male and female cult prostitutes) out of HaAretz, and got rid of kol hagillulim (all the idols) that his avot had made."
Melachim Alef,15,13,"And also Ma'achah immo, even her he deposed from being Gevirah (Queen Mother) , because she had made a mifletzet (idol) to Asherah; and Asa cut down her mifletzet, and burned it in the Kidron Valley."
Melachim Alef,15,14,But the high places were not removed; nevertheless levav Asa was shalem with Hashem all his days.
Melachim Alef,15,15,"And he brought in the kodshei Aviv (the things his father had dedicated) , and the things which he himself had dedicated, into the Beis Hashem , kesef, and zahav, and kelim."
Melachim Alef,15,16,And there was milchamah between Asa and Ba'asha Melech Yisroel all their days.
Melachim Alef,15,17,"And Ba'asha Melech Yisroel went up against Yehudah, and built up Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa Melech Yehudah."
Melachim Alef,15,18,"Then Asa took all the kesef and the zahav that were left in the otzarot of the Beis Hashem , and the otzarot of the Bais HaMelech, and delivered them into the yad of his avadim; and HaMelech Asa sent them to Ben-Hadad, Ben Tavrimmon Ben Chezyon Melech Aram, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,"
Melachim Alef,15,19,"There is a brit between me and thee, and between Avi and Avicha; hinei, I send unto thee a shochad (incentive kind of gift) of kesef and zahav; come, break thy brit with Ba'asha Melech Yisroel, that he may withdraw from me."
Melachim Alef,15,20,"So Ben-Hadad paid heed unto HaMelech Asa, and sent the commanders of his forces against the towns of Yisroel, and struck Iyon, and Dan, and Abel Beit-Ma'achah, and kol Kinnerot, with Kol Eretz Naphtali."
Melachim Alef,15,21,"And it came to pass, when Ba'asha heard this, he stopped building Ramah, and stayed in Tirtzah."
Melachim Alef,15,22,"Then HaMelech Asa made a proclamation throughout all Yehudah; none was exempted; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Ba'asha had built; and HaMelech Asa built up with them Geva of Binyamin, and Mitzpah."
Melachim Alef,15,23,"The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his gevurah, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the Sefer Divrei HaYamim L'Malkhei Yehudah? Nevertheless in the time of his ziknah (old age) he was diseased in his raglayim."
Melachim Alef,15,24,"And Asa slept with his avot, and was buried with his avot in Ir Dovid Aviv; and Yehoshaphat Bno reigned in his place."
Melachim Alef,15,25,"And Nadav Ben Yarov'am began to reign as Melech over Yisroel in the second year of Asa Melech Yehudah, and reigned over Yisroel two years."
Melachim Alef,15,26,"And he did rah in the eyes of Hashem , and walked in the derech Aviv, and in his chattat wherewith he made Yisroel to commit sin."
Melachim Alef,15,27,"And Ba'asha Ben Achiyah, of the Bais of Yissakhar, plotted a keshar against him; and Ba'asha struck him down at Gibeton, which belonged to the Pelishtim; for Nadav and kol Yisroel were laying siege to Gibeton."
Melachim Alef,15,28,"Even in the third year of Asa Melech Yehudah did Ba'asha slay him, and reigned in his place."
Melachim Alef,15,29,"And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he put to death kol Bais Yarov'am; he left not to Yarov'am kol neshamah, until he had destroyed him, according unto the Devar Hashem , which He spoke by His eved Achiyah the Shiloni;"
Melachim Alef,15,30,"Because of the chattot Yarov'am which he sinned, and which he made Yisroel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked Hashem Elohei Yisroel to anger."
Melachim Alef,15,31,"Now the rest of the acts of Nadav, and all that he did, are they not written in the Sefer Divrei HaYamim L'Malkhei Yisroel?"
Melachim Alef,15,32,And there was milchamah between Asa and Ba'asha Melech Yisroel all their days.
Melachim Alef,15,33,"In the third year of Asa Melech Yehudah began Ba'asha Ben Achiyah to reign as Melech over kol Yisroel in Tirtzah, a reign lasting twenty and four years."
Melachim Alef,15,34,"And he did rah (evil) in the eyes of Hashem , and walked in the derech Yarov'am, and in his chattat wherewith he made Yisroel to commit sin."
Melachim Alef,16,1,"Then the Devar Hashem came to Yehu Ben Chanani against Ba'asha, saying,"
Melachim Alef,16,2,"Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the aphar (dust) , and made thee nagid over My people Yisroel; and thou hast walked in the derech Yarov'am, and hast caused My people Yisroel to sin, to provoke Me to anger with their chattot;"
Melachim Alef,16,3,"Hineni, I will sweep away after Ba'asha, and after his Bais; and I will make thy Bais like the Bais Yarov'am Ben Nevat."
Melachim Alef,16,4,Him that dieth of Ba'asha in the Ir shall the kelavim eat; and him that dieth of his in the sadeh (country) shall the oph HaShomayim eat.
Melachim Alef,16,5,"Now the rest of the acts of Ba'asha, and what he did, and his gevurah, are they not written in the Sefer Divrei HaYamim L'Malkhei Yisroel?"
Melachim Alef,16,6,"So Ba'asha slept with his avot, and was buried in Tirtzah: and Elah Bno reigned as Melech in his place."
Melachim Alef,16,7,"And also by the yad HaNavi Yehu Ben Chanani came the Devar Hashem against Ba'asha, and against his Bais, even for all ra'ah that he did in the eyes of Hashem , in provoking Him to anger by the ma'aseh (work) of his hands, in becoming like the Bais Yarov'am; and because he struck it."
Melachim Alef,16,8,"In the twenty and sixth year of Asa Melech Yehudah began Elah Ben Ba'asha to reign as Melech over Yisroel in Tirtzah, reigning two years."
Melachim Alef,16,9,"And his eved (official) Zimri, captain of half his chariots, plotted a kesher against him, while Elah was in Tirtzah, drinking himself shikkor in the bais Artza, who was in charge of the Bais (palace) in Tirtzah."
Melachim Alef,16,10,"And Zimri went in and struck him down, killed him, in the 27 th year of Asa Melech Yehudah, and reigned as Melech in his place."
Melachim Alef,16,11,"And it came to pass, when he began to reign as king, as soon as he sat on his kisse, that he slaughtered kol Bais Ba'asha; he spared him not one mashtin b'kir (one urinating against a wall), not go'alim (redeemers) of his nor re'a of his."
Melachim Alef,16,12,"Thus Zimri destroyed kol Bais Ba'asha, according to Devar Hashem , which He spoke against Ba'asha by Yehu HaNavi."
Melachim Alef,16,13,"For all the chattot of Ba'asha, and the chattot of Elah Bno, by which they sinned, and by which they made Yisroel to sin, in provoking Hashem Elohei Yisroel to anger with their havalim (vanities, nothingnesses)."
Melachim Alef,16,14,"Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the Sefer Divrei HaYamim L'Malkhei Yisroel?"
Melachim Alef,16,15,"In the twenty and seventh year of Asa Melech Yehudah did Zimri reign as Melech shivah yamim in Tirtzah. And the army was encamped against Gibeton, which belonged to the Pelishtim."
Melachim Alef,16,16,"And the army that was encamped heard say, Zimri hath plotted a kesher, and hath also slain HaMelech; wherefore kol Yisroel made Omri, the Sar Tzava, Melech over Yisroel that day in the machaneh."
Melachim Alef,16,17,"And Omri withdrew from Gibeton, and kol Yisroel with him, and they laid siege to Tirtzah."
Melachim Alef,16,18,"And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the Ir was taken, that he went into the armon (palace, castle) of the Bais HaMelech, and he burned the Bais HaMelech over him with eish, and died."
Melachim Alef,16,19,"For his chattot which he sinned in doing rah (evil) in the eyes of Hashem , in walking in the derech Yarov'am, and in his chattat which he did, to make Yisroel to sin."
Melachim Alef,16,20,"Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his kesher that he plotted, are they not written in the Sefer Divrei HaYamim L'Malkhei Yisroel?"
Melachim Alef,16,21,"Then were HaAm Yisroel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tivni Ben Ginat, to make him Melech; and half followed Omri."
Melachim Alef,16,22,"But the people that followed Omri were stronger against the people that followed Tivni Ben Ginat; so Tivni died, and Omri reigned as Melech."
Melachim Alef,16,23,"In the thirty and first year of Asa Melech Yehudah began Omri to reign as Melech over Yisroel, reigning twelve years; shesh shanim reigned he in Tirtzah."
Melachim Alef,16,24,"And he bought the Har Shomron from Shemer for two talents of kesef, and built on the hill, and called the shem of the Ir which he built, after the shem of Shemer, adonei hahar (owner of the hill) , Shomron."
Melachim Alef,16,25,"But Omri wrought rah in the eyes of Hashem , and did sin more than all that were before him."
Melachim Alef,16,26,"For he walked in all the derech Yarov'am Ben Nevat, and in his chattat wherewith he made Yisroel to sin, to provoke Hashem Elohei Yisroel to anger with their havalim (vanities, nothingnesses),"
Melachim Alef,16,27,"Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his gevurah that he did, are they not written in the Sefer Divrei HaYamim L'Malkhei Yisroel?"
Melachim Alef,16,28,"So Omri slept with his avot, and was buried in Shomron; and Ach'av Bno reigned as Melech in his place."
Melachim Alef,16,29,And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa Melech Yehudah began Ach'av Ben Omri (Ahab Son of Omri) to reign as Melech over Yisroel; and Ach'av Ben Omri reigned over Yisroel in Shomron twenty and two shanah.
Melachim Alef,16,30,And Ach'av Ben Omri did rah in the eyes of Hashem above all that were before him.
Melachim Alef,16,31,"And it came to pass, as if it had not been enough for him to walk in the chattot Yarov'am Ben Nevat, he even took as isha Izevel Bat Etba'al Melech Tzidonim, and went and served Ba'al, and worshipped him."
Melachim Alef,16,32,"And he set up a mizbe'ach for Ba'al in the Bais Ba'al, which he had built in Shomron."
Melachim Alef,16,33,And Ach'av made HaAsherah; and Ach'av did more to provoke Hashem Elohei Yisroel to anger than all the Malkhei Yisroel that were before him.
Melachim Alef,16,34,"In his days did Chiel of Beit-El build up Yericho; he laid the foundation thereof [at the cost of the life of] Aviram his bechor; set up the gates thereof [at the cost of the life of] his youngest, Seguv, according to Devar Hashem , which He spoke by Yehoshua Ben Nun."
Melachim Alef,17,1,"And Eliyahu HaTishbi, who was of the inhabitants of Tishbe-Gil'ad, said unto Ach'av (King Ahab of Israel) , As Hashem Elohei Yisroel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be tal nor matar these shanim [ahead], except according to my word."
Melachim Alef,17,2,"And the Devar Hashem came unto him, saying,"
Melachim Alef,17,3,"Get thee from here, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself in the Wadi Kerit, that is near the Yarden."
Melachim Alef,17,4,"And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the orevvim (ravens) to feed thee there."
Melachim Alef,17,5,"So he went and did according to the Devar Hashem ; for he went and dwelt in the Wadi Kerit, that is near the Yarden."
Melachim Alef,17,6,"And the orevvim brought him lechem and basar in the boker, and lechem and basar in the erev; and he drank of the brook."
Melachim Alef,17,7,"And it came to pass at the ketz yamim (end of days) , that the brook dried up, because there had been no geshem in the land."
Melachim Alef,17,8,"And the Devar Hashem came unto him, saying,"
Melachim Alef,17,9,"Arise, get thee to Tzarphat, which belongeth to Tzidon, and dwell there; hinei, I have commanded an isha almanah there to sustain thee."
Melachim Alef,17,10,"So he arose and went to Tzarphat. And when he came to the gate of the ir, hinei, the isha almanah was there gathering sticks; and he called to her, and said, Bring me a little mayim in a vessel, that I may drink."
Melachim Alef,17,11,"And as she was going to get it, he called to her, and said, Bring me a morsel of lechem in thine hand."
Melachim Alef,17,12,"And she said, As Hashem Eloheicha liveth, I have nothing baked, but an handful of meal in a pot, and a little shemen in a jug; and, see, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in, cook it for me and beni, that we may eat it, and die."
Melachim Alef,17,13,"And Eliyahu said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said; but make me thereof a little loaf first, and bring it unto me, and after that make for thee and for thy ben."
Melachim Alef,17,14,"For thus saith Hashem Elohei Yisroel, The pot of meal shall not be used up, neither shall the jug of shemen fail, until the Yom that Hashem sendeth geshem upon ha'adamah."
Melachim Alef,17,15,"And she went and did according to the Devar of Eliyahu; and she, and he, and her bais, did eat [many] yamim."
Melachim Alef,17,16,"And the pot of meal was not used up, neither did the jug of shemen fail, according to the Devar Hashem , which he spoke by Eliyahu."
Melachim Alef,17,17,"And it came to pass after these things, that the ben haisha the ba'alat habais, became choleh; and his sickness was so severe, that there was no nashamah left in him."
Melachim Alef,17,18,"And she said unto Eliyahu, Mah li valach (what have I to do with thee) , Ish HaElohim? Art thou come unto me to remind me of my avon, and to slay beni?"
Melachim Alef,17,19,"And he said unto her, Give me thy ben. And he took him out of her kheyk, and carried him up into the aliyyah (upper room) , where he abode, and laid him upon his own mittah (bed)."
Melachim Alef,17,20,"And he cried out unto Hashem , and said, Hashem Elohai, hast thou even brought evil upon the almanah with whom I sojourn, by slaying her ben?"
Melachim Alef,17,21,"And he stretched himself upon the yeled shalosh pe'amim, and cried out unto Hashem , and said, Hashem Elohai, let this yeledʼs nefesh return to him again."
Melachim Alef,17,22,"And Hashem heard the voice of Eliyahu; and the nefesh of the yeled returned to him again, and he came alive."
Melachim Alef,17,23,"And Eliyahu took the yeled, and brought him down out of the aliyyah into the bais, and delivered him unto his em; and Eliyahu said, Look! Thy ben liveth."
Melachim Alef,17,24,"And the isha said to Eliyahu, Now by this I have da'as that thou art an Ish Elohim, and that the Devar Hashem in thy mouth is emes."
Melachim Alef,18,1,"And it came to pass after yamim rabbim, that the Devar Hashem came to Eliyahu in the shanah hashlishit, saying, Go, show thyself unto Ach'av; and I will send matar upon the face of ha'adamah."
Melachim Alef,18,2,And Eliyahu went to show himself unto Ach'av. And there was a ra'av chazak (strong famine) in Shomron.
Melachim Alef,18,3,"And Ach'av summoned Ovadyah, who was in charge of the Bayit (Palace) — now Ovadyah feared Hashem me'od (greatly);"
Melachim Alef,18,4,"For it was so, when Izevel cut off the Nevi'im of Hashem , that Ovadyah took a hundred Nevi'im, and hid them by fifty in a me'arah (cave) , and fed them with lechem and mayim —"
Melachim Alef,18,5,"And Ach'av said unto Ovadyah, Go into HaAretz unto all springs of mayim, and unto all brooks; perhaps we may find khatzir (grass) to save the sus (horse) and pered (mules) alive, that we not be dispossessed of all the behemah."
Melachim Alef,18,6,"So they divided ha'aretz between them to pass throughout it; Ach'av went derech echad by himself, and Ovadyah went derech echad by himself."
Melachim Alef,18,7,"And as Ovadyah was baderech (on the way, road) , hinei, Eliyahu met him; and he recognized him, and fell on his face, and said, Is it you, adoni Eliyahu?"
Melachim Alef,18,8,"And he answered him, I am; go, tell adoneicha, Hinei, Eliyahu!"
Melachim Alef,18,9,"And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy eved into the yad Ach'av to slay me?"
Melachim Alef,18,10,"As Hashem Eloheicha liveth, there is no goy (nation) or mamlachah (kingdom) , to where adoni hath not sent to seek thee there: and when they said, He is not there, he had the mamlachah and goy swear, that they found thee not."
Melachim Alef,18,11,"And now thou sayest, Go, tell adoneicha, Hinei, Eliyahu!"
Melachim Alef,18,12,"And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the Ruach of Hashem shall carry thee to where I know not; and so when I come and tell Ach'av, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me; but I thy eved fear Hashem from my youth."
Melachim Alef,18,13,"Was it not told to adoni what I did when Izevel slaughtered the Nevi'im of Hashem , how I hid a hundred ish of Hashem ʼs Nevi'im by fifty in a me'arah, and fed them with lechem and mayim?"
Melachim Alef,18,14,"And now thou sayest, Go, tell adoneicha, Hinei, Eliyahu! And he shall slay me."
Melachim Alef,18,15,"And Eliyahu said, As Hashem Tzva'os liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself unto him today."
Melachim Alef,18,16,"So Ovadyah went to meet Ach'av, and told him; and Ach'av went to meet Eliyahu."
Melachim Alef,18,17,"And it came to pass, when Ach'av saw Eliyahu, that Ach'av said unto him, Art thou he that troubleth Yisroel?"
Melachim Alef,18,18,"And he answered, I have not troubled Yisroel; but thou, and the Bais Avicha, in that ye have forsaken the Mitzvot Hashem , and thou hast followed after the Ba'alim."
Melachim Alef,18,19,"Now therefore summon, and gather to me kol Yisroel unto Har HaCarmel and the nevi'im of Ba'al four hundred and fifty, and the nevi'im haAsherah four hundred, which eat at shulchan Izevel."
Melachim Alef,18,20,"So Ach'av sent unto kol Bnei Yisroel, and gathered the Nevi'im together unto Har HaCarmel."
Melachim Alef,18,21,"And Eliyahu came unto kol haAm, and said, Ad Mosai (how long) ye be polekhim (limping ones, dancing ones) between two se'ipim (opinions) ? If Hashem be HaElohim, follow after him; but if HaBa'al, then follow after him. And HaAm answered him not a word."
Melachim Alef,18,22,"Then said Eliyahu unto HaAm, I, even I only, am left a navi of Hashem ; but Ba'alʼs nevi'im are four hundred and fifty ish."
Melachim Alef,18,23,"Let them therefore give us two parim (bulls) ; and let them choose one bull for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no eish under it; and I will dress the other bull, and lay it on wood, and put no eish under it;"
Melachim Alef,18,24,"And call ye on the shem eloheichem, and I will call on the Shem of Hashem ; and haelohim that answereth by eish, let him be HaElohim. And kol haAm answered and said, Tov hadavar!"
Melachim Alef,18,25,"And Eliyahu said unto the nevi'im of Ba'al, Choose you one bull for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are rabbim (many) ; and call on the shem eloheichem, but put no eish under it."
Melachim Alef,18,26,"And they took the bull which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the shem of Ba'al from boker even until tzohorayim (noon) , saying, O Ba'al, answer us. But there was no voice, and no one answered. And they danced around the mizbe'ach which had been made."
Melachim Alef,18,27,"And it came to pass at tzohorayim, that Eliyahu mocked them, taunting, saying, Shout with a kol gadol (loud voice) ; for he is a g-d; either he is meditating, or he is pursuing, or ki derech lo (perhaps he had to travel, heʼs relieving himself) , or perhaps he sleepeth and must be awakened."
Melachim Alef,18,28,"And they shouted with a kol gadol, and cut themselves after their mishpat (custom) with charavot (swords) and lances, till the dahm gushed out upon them."
Melachim Alef,18,29,"And it came to pass, when tzohorayim was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the minchah (evening sacrifice) , that there was neither kol (voice) , nor any oneh (responder) nor any attender."
Melachim Alef,18,30,"And Eliyahu said unto kol HaAm, Come near unto me. And kol HaAm came near unto him. And he repaired the Mizbe'ach Hashem that was in ruins."
Melachim Alef,18,31,"And Eliyahu took twelve avanim (stones) , according to the mispar (number) of the Shivtei Bnei Ya'akov, unto whom the Devar Hashem came, saying, Yisroel shall be Shemecha;"
Melachim Alef,18,32,"And with the avanim (stones) he built a Mizbe'ach in the Shem of Hashem ; and he made a te'alah (trench) around the Mizbe'ach, as the space of two seahs of zera (seed)."
Melachim Alef,18,33,"And he laid the wood in order, and cut up the bull, and laid it on the wood, and said, Fill four jugs with mayim, and pour it on the olah and on the wood."
Melachim Alef,18,34,"And Eliyahu said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time."
Melachim Alef,18,35,And the mayim ran around about the Mizbe'ach; and even filled the te'alah (trench) also with mayim.
Melachim Alef,18,36,"And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the minchah (evening sacrifice) , that Eliyahu HaNavi came near, and said, Hashem Elohei Avraham, Yitzchak and of Yisroel, let it be known this day that Thou art Elohim in Yisroel, and that I am Thy Eved, and that I have done all these things at Thy Davar."
Melachim Alef,18,37,"Answer me, Hashem , answer me, that HaAm Hazeh may know that Thou art Hashem HaElohim, and that Thou hast turned back their lev."
Melachim Alef,18,38,"Then the Eish of Hashem fell, and consumed the olah and the wood, and the avanim, and the aphar, and licked up the mayim that was in the te'alah (trench)."
Melachim Alef,18,39,"And when kol HaAm saw it, they fell on their faces; and they said, Hashem hu HaElohim; Hashem hu HaElohim."
Melachim Alef,18,40,"And Eliyahu said unto them, Seize the nevi'im of Ba'al; let not one of them escape. And they took them; and Eliyahu brought them down to the Brook Kishon, and slaughtered them there."
Melachim Alef,18,41,"And Eliyahu said unto Ach'av, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is a kol hamon hageshem (sound of rushing rain, sound of rain coming)."
Melachim Alef,18,42,"So Ach'av went up to eat and to drink. But Eliyahu climbed up to Rosh HaCarmel (top of Carmel) ; and he cast himself down upon the ground, and put his face between his birkayim (knees),"
Melachim Alef,18,43,"And said to his eved, Go up now, look toward the yam. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again sheva pe'amim (seven times)."
Melachim Alef,18,44,"And it came to pass the seventh time, that he said, Hinei, there ariseth a little cloud out of the yam, as small as kaf ish (a manʼs palm) . And he said, Go, say unto Ach'av, Harness up [thy merkavah] and get thee down that the geshem stop thee not."
Melachim Alef,18,45,"And it came to pass in the meanwhile, that the Shomayim grew black with clouds and ruach, and there was a geshem gadol. And Ach'av rode, and went to Yizre'el."
Melachim Alef,18,46,"And the Yad Hashem was on Eliyahu; and he girded up his loins, and ran ahead of Ach'av to the entrance of Yizre'el."
Melachim Alef,19,1,"And Ach'av told Izevel all that Eliyahu had done, and how he had slain kol haNevi'im with the cherev."
Melachim Alef,19,2,"Then Izevel sent a malach unto Eliyahu, saying, So let elohim do to me, and more also, if I make not thy nefesh as the life of one of them by this time makhar (tomorrow)."
Melachim Alef,19,3,"And when he saw that, he arose, and fled for his nefesh, and came to Be'er-Sheva, which belongeth to Yehudah, and left his na'ar (servant) there."
Melachim Alef,19,4,"But he himself went derech yom (a dayʼs journey) into the midbar, and came and sat down under a broom tree; and he requested for his nefesh to die; and said, It is enough; now, O Hashem , take away my nefesh; for I am no better than my avot."
Melachim Alef,19,5,"And as he lay and slept under a broom tree, hinei, then a malach touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat."
Melachim Alef,19,6,"And he looked, and, hinei, there at his rosh was an oogah (disk or cake of bread) baked on hot coals, and a jar of mayim. And he did eat and drink, and returned to lie down again."
Melachim Alef,19,7,"And the Malach Hashem came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the derech is too great for thee."
Melachim Alef,19,8,"And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the ko'ach ha'achilah hahi (strength of that food) arba'im yom v'arba'im lailah unto Chorev the Har HaElohim."
Melachim Alef,19,9,"And he came there unto hame'arah (the cave) , and lodged there; and, hinei, the Devar Hashem came to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here, Eliyahu?"
Melachim Alef,19,10,"And he said, I have been very kina (jealous, zealous) for Hashem Elohei Tzivos; for the Bnei Yisroel have forsaken Thy Brit (Covenant), thrown down Thine mizbechot, and slain Thy nevi'im with the cherev; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my nefesh, to take it away."
Melachim Alef,19,11,"And He said, Go forth, and stand upon the Har before Hashem . And, hinei, Hashem passed by, and a ruach gedolah v'chazak rent the mountains, and broke in pieces the sela'im (rocks) before Hashem ; but Hashem was not in the ruach; and after the ruach, a ra'ash (earthquake) ; but Hashem was not in the ra'ash;"
Melachim Alef,19,12,"And after the ra'ash an eish; but Hashem was not in the eish; and after the eish a kol demamah dakkah (a quiet, gentle voice)."
Melachim Alef,19,13,"And it was so, when Eliyahu heard it, that he wrapped his face in his aderet (cloak, mantle) , and went out, and stood in the mouth of the me'arah. And, hinei, there came a kol (voice) unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Eliyahu?"
Melachim Alef,19,14,"And he said, I have been very kina for Hashem Elohei Tzivos; because the Bnei Yisroel have forsaken Thy Brit (Covenant), thrown down Thine mizbechot, and slain Thy nevi'im with the cherev; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my nefesh, to take it away."
Melachim Alef,19,15,"And Hashem said unto him, Go, shuv (return) on thy derech to the midbar of Damascus; and when thou comest, anoint Chazael to be Melech over Syria;"
Melachim Alef,19,16,And Yehu ben Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be Melech over Yisroel; and Elishah ben Shaphat of Avel-Mecholah shalt thou anoint to be navi in thy place.
Melachim Alef,19,17,"And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the cherev of Chazael shall Yehu slay; and him that escapeth from the cherev of Yehu shall Elishah slay."
Melachim Alef,19,18,"Yet I have left me shivat alafim in Yisroel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Ba'al, and every mouth which hath not kissed him."
Melachim Alef,19,19,"So he departed from there, and found Elishah ben Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth; and Eliyahu passed by him, and cast his aderet (cloak, mantle) upon him."
Melachim Alef,19,20,"And he left the bakar (oxen) , and ran after Eliyahu, and said, Let me now kiss Avi and Immi, and then I will follow thee. And he said unto him, Shuv (go back again) : for what have I done to thee?"
Melachim Alef,19,21,"And he returned from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slaughtered them, and boiled their basar with the equipment of the oxen, and gave unto the Am, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Eliyahu, and ministered unto him."
Melachim Alef,20,1,"And Ben-Hadad Melech Aram gathered all his army together; and there were thirty and two melech with him, and sus, and chariots; and he went up and laid siege against Shomron, and warred against her."
Melachim Alef,20,2,"And he sent malachim to Ach'av Melech Yisroel into the Ir, and said unto him, Thus saith Ben-Hadad,"
Melachim Alef,20,3,"Thy kesef and thy zahav is mine; thy nashim also and thy banim, even the tovim (best) are mine."
Melachim Alef,20,4,"And the Melech Yisroel answered and said, Adoni, O melech, according to thy word, I am thine, and all that I have."
Melachim Alef,20,5,"And the malachim came again, and said, Thus speaketh Ben-Hadad, saying, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me thy kesef, thy zahav, thy nashim, thy banim;"
Melachim Alef,20,6,"Yet I will send my avadim unto thee tomorrow about this time, and they shall search thine Bais (Palace) , and the batim (houses) of thy avadim; and it shall be, that whatsoever is makhmad (precious) in thine eyes, they shall put it in their yad, and take it away."
Melachim Alef,20,7,"Then the Melech Yisroel summoned kol Ziknei HaAretz, and said, Mark, now, and see how this man seeketh ra'ah; for he sent unto me for my nashim, for my banim, for my kesef, for my zahav; and I denied him not."
Melachim Alef,20,8,"All the zekenim and kol HaAm said unto him, Pay not heed unto him, nor consent."
Melachim Alef,20,9,"Wherefore he said unto the malachim of Ben-Hadad, Tell adoni HaMelech, All that thou didst send for to thy eved at the first I will do; but this thing I may not do. And the malachim departed, and took him back davar."
Melachim Alef,20,10,"And Ben-Hadad sent unto him, and said, The elohim (g-ds) do so unto me, and more also, if the aphar Shomron shall provide even a handful for kol haAm (each of the people) who are at my raglayim."
Melachim Alef,20,11,"And the Melech Yisroel answered and said, Tell him, Let not khoger (one girding on) boast himself as he that taketh off."
Melachim Alef,20,12,"And it came to pass, when Ben-Hadad heard this davar, as he was drinking, he and the melachim in the sukkot, that he said unto his avadim, Get ready to attack. And they set themselves in array against the Ir."
Melachim Alef,20,13,"And, hinei, there came one navi unto Ach'av Melech Yisroel, saying, Thus saith Hashem , Hast thou seen all this hamon hagadol (vast multitude) ? Hineni, I will deliver it into thine yad this day; and thou shalt know that I am Hashem."
Melachim Alef,20,14,"Ach'av said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith Hashem , Even by the na'arei sarei hamedinot (the servants of the provincial commanders) . Then he said, Who shall lead out in the milchamah? He answered, Thou."
Melachim Alef,20,15,"Then he numbered the na'arei sarei hamedinot, and they were two hundred and thirty-two; and after them he numbered kol HaAm, even all the Bnei Yisroel, being shivat alafim."
Melachim Alef,20,16,"And they set forth at tzohorayim. But Ben-Hadad was drinking himself shikkor in the sukkot, he and the melachim, the thirty and two melachim ozer (allied with) him."
Melachim Alef,20,17,"And the na'arei sarei hamedinot went out first; and Ben-Hadad sent out, and they reported to him, saying, There are anashim come out from Shomron."
Melachim Alef,20,18,"And he said, Whether they be come out for shalom, take them chayyim (alive) ; or whether they be come out for milchamah, take them chayyim (alive)."
Melachim Alef,20,19,"So these na'arei sarei hamedinot came out of the Ir, and the army which followed them."
Melachim Alef,20,20,And they struck down every ish his ish; and Aram (the Syrians) fled; and Yisroel pursued them; and Ben-Hadad Melech Aram escaped al-sus (on horse) and the parashim (cavalry).
Melachim Alef,20,21,"And the Melech Yisroel went out, and struck down sus and chariot, and slaughtered Aram with a makkah gedolah (great slaughter)."
Melachim Alef,20,22,"And the navi came to the Melech Yisroel, and said unto him, Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest; for at the teshuvat hashanah (the turn of the year, springtime) Melech Aram will come up against thee."
Melachim Alef,20,23,"The avadim of Melech Aram said unto him, Their elohim are elohei harim (g-ds of the hills) ; therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them on the plain; then surely we shall be stronger than they."
Melachim Alef,20,24,"And do this thing: Remove the melachim, every ish from his makom (place, post) , and put officers in their places;"
Melachim Alef,20,25,"And muster thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, sus for sus, and merkavah for merkavah; and we will fight against them on the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. And he paid heed unto their voice, and did so."
Melachim Alef,20,26,"And it came to pass at the teshuvat hashanah, that Ben-Hadad mustered Aram, and went up to Aphek, to war against Yisroel."
Melachim Alef,20,27,"And the Bnei Yisroel were mustered, and were all outfitted as battle-ready, and marched out to meet them; and the Bnei Yisroel encamped opposite them like two little flocks of izzim (goats) ; but Aram (the Syrians) filled ha'aretz."
Melachim Alef,20,28,"And there came an Ish HaElohim, and spoke unto Melech Yisroel, and said, Thus saith Hashem , Because Aram have said, Hashem is Elohei Harim, but not Elohei Amakim (G-d of Valleys) therefore will I deliver all this hamon hagadol (vast multitude) into thine yad, and ye shall know that I am Hashem."
Melachim Alef,20,29,"And they encamped these opposite those shivat yamim. And so it was, that in the yom hashevi'i the milchamah was joined; and the Bnei Yisroel slaughtered of Aram a hundred thousand foot soldiers in yom echad."
Melachim Alef,20,30,"But the rest fled to Aphek, into the Ir; and there a chomah (wall) fell upon twenty and seven elef ish that were left. And Ben-Hadad fled, and went into the Ir, into cheder b'cheder (a room within a room, an inner room)."
Melachim Alef,20,31,"And his avadim said unto him, Hinei now, we have heard that the melachim of Bais Yisroel are malkhei chesed; let us, now, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the Melech Yisroel; perhaps he will save thy nefesh."
Melachim Alef,20,32,"So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the Melech Yisroel, and said, Thy eved Ben-Hadad saith, Let now my nefesh live. And he said, Is he yet alive? He is achi (my brother)."
Melachim Alef,20,33,"Now the anashim did interpret this as a sign of mercy from him, and did hastily seize on it; and they said, Thy brother Ben-Hadad! Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Ben-Hadad came forth to him; and he brought him up onto the merkavah."
Melachim Alef,20,34,"And Ben-hadad said unto him, The cities, which Avi took from Avicha, I will return; and thou shalt set up chutzot (market areas) for thee in Damascus, just as Avi set up in Shomron. Then said Ach'av, I will send thee away with this brit (covenant) . So he made a brit (covenant) with him, and sent him away."
Melachim Alef,20,35,"And a certain man of the Bnei HaNevi'im said unto his re'a (neighbor) in the Devar Hashem , Strike me, now. The ish refused to strike him."
Melachim Alef,20,36,"Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the kol Hashem , behold, thou, as soon as thou art departed from me, an aryeh shall kill thee. And as soon as he was departed from him, an aryeh found him, and killed him."
Melachim Alef,20,37,"Then he found another ish, and said, strike me, now. And the ish struck him, so that in striking he wounded him."
Melachim Alef,20,38,"So the navi departed, and stood waiting for HaMelech by the derech, and disguised himself with bandage over his eyes."
Melachim Alef,20,39,"And as HaMelech passed by, he cried out unto HaMelech; and he said, Thy eved went out into the thick of the milchamah; and, hinei, an ish turned aside, and brought an ish unto me, and said, Be shomer over (guard) this ish: if by any means he be missing, then shall thy nefesh be for his nefesh, or else thou must pay a talent of kesef."
Melachim Alef,20,40,"And while thy eved was busy here and there, he was gone. And the Melech Yisroel said unto him, So shall thy mishpat be; thyself hast decided it."
Melachim Alef,20,41,"And he hasted, and removed the bandage from over his eyes; and Melech Yisroel recognized him that he was of the Nevi'im."
Melachim Alef,20,42,"And he said unto him, Thus saith Hashem , Because thou hast let go out of thy yad an ish whom I appointed to cherem (utter destruction) , therefore thy nefesh shall be for his nefesh, and thy people instead of his people."
Melachim Alef,20,43,"And Melech Yisroel came to his bais sar veza'ef (sullen and dejected) , and came to Shomron."
Melachim Alef,21,1,"And it came to pass after these things, that Navot the Yizre'eli had a kerem (vineyard) , which was in Yizre'el (Jezreel) , beside the heikhal (palace) Ach'av Melech Shomron."
Melachim Alef,21,2,"And Ach'av spoke unto Navot, saying, Give me thy kerem (vineyard) , that I may have it for an herb gan (garden) , because it is karov (near) unto my Bais; and I will give thee in exchange for it a tov kerem (better vineyard) than it; or, if it seem tov in thine eyes, I will give thee the worth of it in kesef."
Melachim Alef,21,3,"And Navot said to Ach'av, Chalilah li me' Hashem (far be it from me before Hashem) , that I should give the nachalat Avoti unto thee."
Melachim Alef,21,4,"And Ach'av came into his Bais sar veza'ef (sullen and dejected) because of the davar which Navot the Yizre'eli had spoken to him; for he had said, I will not give thee the nachalat avoti. And he lay down upon his mittah, and turned away his face, and would eat no lechem."
Melachim Alef,21,5,"But Izevel his isha came to him, and said unto him, Mah zeh (What [is] this?) Thy ruach is sarah (sullen) , that thou eatest no lechem?"
Melachim Alef,21,6,"And he said unto her, Because I spoke unto Navot the Yizre'eli and said unto him, Give me thy kerem (vineyard) for kesef; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee another kerem (vineyard) in its place; but he answered, I will not give thee my kerem (vineyard)."
Melachim Alef,21,7,"And Izevel his isha said unto him, What a grand sovereign over Yisroel you are! Arise, and eat lechem, and let thine lev be cheerful; I will give thee the kerem (vineyard) of Navot the Yizre'eli."
Melachim Alef,21,8,"So she wrote sefarim (letters) b'shem Ach'av, and sealed them with his chotam (seal) , and sent the sefarim unto the zekenim and to the chorim (nobles, rulers) that were in his city, dwelling with Navot."
Melachim Alef,21,9,"And she wrote in the sefarim, saying, Proclaim a tzom, and set Navot on high among the people;"
Melachim Alef,21,10,"And seat two men, bnei beliyaal, opposite him, to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst upon Elohim and Melech make a brocha! And then take him out, and stone him, that he may die."
Melachim Alef,21,11,"And the anashim of his city, even the zekenim and the chorim (nobles) who were the inhabitants in his city, did just as Izevel had sent unto them, and just as it was written in the sefarim which she had sent unto them."
Melachim Alef,21,12,"They proclaimed a tzom, and seated Navot on high among the people."
Melachim Alef,21,13,"And there came in two anashim, bnei beliyaal, and sat opposite him; and the anashim of beliyaal witnessed against him, even against Navot, in the presence of the people, saying, Navot blasphemed Elohim vaMelech! Then they took him forth outside of the Ir, and stoned him with stones, that he died."
Melachim Alef,21,14,"Then they sent to Izevel, saying, Navot is stoned, and is dead."
Melachim Alef,21,15,"And it came to pass, when Izevel heard that Navot was stoned, and was dead, that Izevel said to Ach'av, Arise, take possession of the kerem of Navot the Yizre'eli, which he refused to give thee for kesef; for Navot is not chai (alive) , but met (dead)."
Melachim Alef,21,16,"And it came to pass, when Ach'av heard that Navot was dead, that Ach'av rose up to go down to the kerem of Navot the Yizre'eli, to take possession of it."
Melachim Alef,21,17,"And the Devar Hashem came to Eliyahu the Tishbi, saying,"
Melachim Alef,21,18,"Arise, go down to meet Ach'av Melech Yisroel, which is in Shomron; hinei, he is in the kerem of Navot, where he has gone down to take possession of it."
Melachim Alef,21,19,"And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith Hashem , Hast thou committed murder, then also hast thou inherited? And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith Hashem , In the makom (place) where kelavim licked the dahm Navot shall kelavim lick thy dahm also, even thine."
Melachim Alef,21,20,"And Ach'av said to Eliyahu, Hast thou found me, O mine oyev? And he answered, I have found thee; because thou hast sold thyself to work rah in front of the eyes of Hashem."
Melachim Alef,21,21,"Hineni, I will bring ra'ah upon thee, and will utterly sweep thee away, and will cut off from Ach'av mashtin b'kir (him that urinates against a wall), atzur (bond) and azuv (free) in Yisroel,"
Melachim Alef,21,22,"And will make thine Bais like the Bais Yarov'am Ben Nevat, and like the Bais Ba'asha Ben Achiyah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked Me to anger, and caused Yisroel to sin."
Melachim Alef,21,23,"And of Izevel also spoke Hashem , saying, The kelavim shall devour Izevel by the wall of Yizre'el."
Melachim Alef,21,24,Him of Ach'av that dieth in the Ir the kelavim shall devour; and him that dieth in the sadeh shall the oph haShomayim devour.
Melachim Alef,21,25,"But there was none like unto Ach'av, which did sell himself to work rah before the eyes of Hashem , whom Izevel his isha urged on."
Melachim Alef,21,26,"And he acted monstrously in going after gillulim (idols) , according to all things as did HaEmori, whom Hashem drove out before the Bnei Yisroel."
Melachim Alef,21,27,"And it came to pass, when Ach'av heard those words, that he tore his begadim, put sackcloth upon his basar, did a tzom, lay in sackcloth, and walked about subdued."
Melachim Alef,21,28,"And the Devar Hashem came to Eliyahu the Tishbi, saying,"
Melachim Alef,21,29,"Seest thou how Ach'av humbleth himself before Me? because he humbleth himself before Me, I will not bring hara'ah in his days: but in the yamim bno will I bring ra'ah (disaster) upon his Bais."
Melachim Alef,22,1,And they continued three years without war between Aram and Yisroel.
Melachim Alef,22,2,"And it came to pass in the third year, that Yehoshaphat Melech Yehudah came down to Melech Yisroel."
Melachim Alef,22,3,"And Melech Yisroel said unto his avadim, Know ye that Ramot-Gil'ad is ours, and we hesitate, and take it not out of the hand of HaMelech Aram?"
Melachim Alef,22,4,"And he said unto Yehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramot-Gil'ad? And Yehoshaphat said to the Melech Yisroel, I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my susim as thy susim."
Melachim Alef,22,5,"And Yehoshaphat said unto the Melech Yisroel, Inquire for the Devar Hashem today."
Melachim Alef,22,6,"Then the Melech Yisroel gathered the nevi'im together, about 400 men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramot-Gil'ad to battle, or shall I refrain? And they said, Go up; for Hashem shall deliver it into the hand of HaMelech."
Melachim Alef,22,7,"And Yehoshaphat said, Is there not here a navi of Hashem besides, that we might inquire of him?"
Melachim Alef,22,8,"And the Melech Yisroel said unto Yehoshaphat, There is yet one man, Mikhay'hu ben Yimlach, by whom we may inquire of Hashem : but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy tov concerning me, but rah. And Yehoshaphat said, Let not HaMelech say such."
Melachim Alef,22,9,"Then HaMelech Yisroel called an officer, and said, Hasten here Mikhay'hu ben Yimlach."
Melachim Alef,22,10,"And the Melech Yisroel and Yehoshaphat Melech Yehudah sat each on his kisse, having put on their robes, at the threshing floor in the entrance of sha'ar Shomron; all the nevi'im prophesied before them."
Melachim Alef,22,11,"Tzidkiyah ben Kena'anah made him horns of barzel: and said, Thus saith Hashem , With these shalt thou push Aram until thou have consumed them."
Melachim Alef,22,12,"And all the nevi'im prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramot-Gil'ad, and succeed: for Hashem shall deliver it into the yad HaMelech."
Melachim Alef,22,13,"And the malach that was gone to summon Mikhay'hu spoke unto him, saying, Hinei now, the words of the nevi'im declare tov unto HaMelech with one mouth: let thy word be like the word of one of them, speak that which is tov."
Melachim Alef,22,14,"And Mikhay'hu said, As Hashem liveth, what Hashem saith unto me, that will I speak."
Melachim Alef,22,15,"So he came to HaMelech. And HaMelech said unto him, Mikhay'hu, shall we go against Ramot-Gil'ad to battle, or shall we refrain? And he answered him, Go, and succeed: for Hashem shall deliver it into the yad HaMelech."
Melachim Alef,22,16,"And HaMelech said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the Shem of Hashem?"
Melachim Alef,22,17,"And he said, I saw kol Yisroel scattered upon the hills, as Tzon that have not a Ro'eh: and Hashem said, These have no adonim: let them return every man to his bais in shalom."
Melachim Alef,22,18,"And the Melech Yisroel said unto Yehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no tov concerning me, but rah?"
Melachim Alef,22,19,"And he said, Shema Devar Hashem : I saw Hashem sitting on his kisse, and all the Tzva HaShomayim standing by Him on His right hand and on His left."
Melachim Alef,22,20,"And Hashem said, Who shall persuade Ach'av, that he may go up and fall at Ramot-Gil'ad? And one said one thing, and one said another."
Melachim Alef,22,21,"And there came forth the ruach, and stood before Hashem , and said, I will persuade him."
Melachim Alef,22,22,"And Hashem said unto him, By what means? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a ruach sheker in the mouth of all his nevi'im. And he said, Thou shalt persuade him, and prevail also; go forth, do so."
Melachim Alef,22,23,"Now therefore, hinei, Hashem hath put a ruach sheker in the mouth of all these thy nevi'im, and Hashem hath spoken ra'ah concerning thee."
Melachim Alef,22,24,"But Tzidkiyahu ben Kena'anah went near, and struck Mikhay'hu on the cheek, and said, Which way did the Ruach Hashem go when he went from me to speak to you?"
Melachim Alef,22,25,"And Mikhay'hu said, Hinei, thou shalt see in that yom, when thou shalt go into a cheder b'cheder (inner room) to hide thyself."
Melachim Alef,22,26,"And the Melech Yisroel said, Take Mikhay'hu, and carry him back unto Amon Sar HaIr, and to Yoash ben HaMelech;"
Melachim Alef,22,27,"And say, Thus saith HaMelech, Put this fellow in the bais hakeleh, and feed him with lechem lachatz (bread of affliction) and with mayim lachatz (water of affliction) , until I come in shalom."
Melachim Alef,22,28,"And Mikhay'hu said, If thou return at all in shalom, Hashem hath not spoken by me. And he said, Pay heed, O people, every one of you."
Melachim Alef,22,29,So the Melech Yisroel and Yehoshaphat Melech Yehudah went up to Ramot-Gil'ad.
Melachim Alef,22,30,"And the Melech Yisroel said unto Yehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the milchamah; but put thou on thy robes. And the Melech Yisroel disguised himself, and went into the milchamah."
Melachim Alef,22,31,"But HaMelech Aram commanded his 32 captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with katan nor gadol, save only with the Melech Yisroel."
Melachim Alef,22,32,"And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Yehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the Melech Yisroel. And they turned aside to fight against him. Yehoshaphat cried out."
Melachim Alef,22,33,"And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not Melech Yisroel, they turned from pursuing him."
Melachim Alef,22,34,"And a certain man drew a keshet (bow) at random, and struck Melech Yisroel between the joints of his armor; wherefore he said unto the driver of his merkavah, Turn around thine hand, and carry me out of the battle; for I am wounded."
Melachim Alef,22,35,"And the milchamah increased that yom; and HaMelech was propped up in his merkavah against the Syrians, and died at erev; and the dahm ran out of the wound onto the floor of the merkavah."
Melachim Alef,22,36,"And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the shemesh, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country."
Melachim Alef,22,37,"So Melech died, and was brought to Shomron; and they buried HaMelech in Shomron."
Melachim Alef,22,38,And one washed the merkavah in the pool of Shomron; and the kelavim licked up his dahm while the zonot bathed; according unto the Devar Hashem which he spoke.
Melachim Alef,22,39,"Now the rest of the acts of Ach'av (Ahab) , and all that he did, and the Bais HaShen (House of Ivory) which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the Sefer Divrei HaYamim l'Malkhei Yisroel?"
Melachim Alef,22,40,So Ach'av slept with his avot; and Achazyahu beno (his son) reigned in his place.
Melachim Alef,22,41,And Yehoshaphat ben Asa began to reign over Yehudah in the fourth year of Ach'av Melech Yisroel.
Melachim Alef,22,42,Yehoshaphat was 35 shanah when he began to reign; and he reigned 25 shanah in Yerushalayim. And the shem immo was Azuvah bat Shilchi.
Melachim Alef,22,43,"And he walked in kol derech Asa aviv; he turned not aside from it, doing that which was yashar in the eyes of Hashem ; nevertheless the high places (places of pagan worship) were not taken away; for HaAm offered and burned incense yet in the high places."
Melachim Alef,22,44,And Yehoshaphat made peace with Melech Yisroel.
Melachim Alef,22,45,"Now the rest of the acts of Yehoshaphat, and his gevurah that he showed, and how he warred, are they not written in the Sefer Divrei HaYamim l'Malkhei Yehudah?"
Melachim Alef,22,46,"And the remnant of the kadesh (male and female cult prostitutes) , which remained in the days of Asa aviv, he took out of HaAretz."
Melachim Alef,22,47,There was then no melech in Edom; a deputy was melech.
Melachim Alef,22,48,Yehoshaphat made [merchant] oniyot (ships) of Tarshish to go to Ophir for zahav; but they went not; for the oniyot were shipwrecked at Etzyon-Gever.
Melachim Alef,22,49,"Then said Achazyahu ben Ach'av unto Yehoshaphat, Let my avadim go with thy avadim in the oniyot. But Yehoshaphat would not."
Melachim Alef,22,50,"And Yehoshaphat slept with his avot, and was buried with his avot in the Ir Dovid aviv; and Yehoram bno reigned in his place."
Melachim Alef,22,51,"Achazyahu ben Ach'av began to reign over Yisroel in Shomron the seventeenth year of Yehoshaphat Melech Yehudah, and reigned two years over Yisroel."
Melachim Alef,22,52,"And he did rah in the sight of Hashem , walked in the derech aviv, and in the derech immo, and in the derech Yarov'am ben Nevat, who made Yisroel to sin;"
Melachim Alef,22,53,"For he served HaBa'al, and worshiped him, and provoked to anger Hashem Elohei Yisroel, according to all that aviv had done."
