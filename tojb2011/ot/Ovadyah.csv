Ovadyah,1,1,"The chazon (vision) of Ovadyah: Thus saith Adonoi Hashem concerning Edom: We have heard a report from Hashem , and an envoy is sent among the Goyim, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her (Edom) in battle."
Ovadyah,1,2,"Hinei, I have made thee small among the Goyim; thou art greatly despised."
Ovadyah,1,3,"The zadon (pride, presumption, arrogance) of thine lev (heart) hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that saith in his lev, Who shall bring me down to the ground?"
Ovadyah,1,4,"Though thou exalt thyself to soar as the nesher, and though thou set thy nest among the kokhavim (stars) , thence will I bring thee down, saith Hashem."
Ovadyah,1,5,"If ganavim (thieves) came to thee, if shodedei lailah (robbers by night) — oh how art thou cut off! — would they not have stolen only till they had enough? If the grape gatherers came to thee, would they not leave some grapes?"
Ovadyah,1,6,How is Esav searched out! How are his hidden treasures pillaged!
Ovadyah,1,7,"All the men of thy alliance have forced thee and brought thee even to the border; the anshei shlomecha (the men that were at peace with thee) have deceived thee, and prevailed against thee; they that eat thy lechem (bread) have laid a mazor (net, trap) under thee; there is none detecting it."
Ovadyah,1,8,"Shall I not in that day, saith Hashem , even destroy the chachamim (wise men) out of Edom, and understanding out of the Har Esav?"
Ovadyah,1,9,"And thy gibborim (mighty men) , O Teman, shall be dismayed and lose courage, to the end that every one of the Har Esav may be cut off by slaughter."
Ovadyah,1,10,"For thy chamas against thy brother Ya'akov, bushah (shame) shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off l'olam (for ever)."
Ovadyah,1,11,"In the day that thou stood aloof on the other side, in the day that the zarim (strangers) carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots for Yerushalayim, even thou wast as one of them."
Ovadyah,1,12,But thou shouldest not have gloated over the day of thy brother in the day of his misfortune; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the Bnei Yehudah in the day of their destruction; neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the Yom Tzarah (Day of Trouble).
Ovadyah,1,13,"Thou shouldest not have entered into the sha'ar Ami (gate of My people) in the day of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have looked down on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity;"
Ovadyah,1,14,"Neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossroads, to cut off those of his that did escape; neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his that did survive in the Yom Tzarah."
Ovadyah,1,15,"For the Yom Hashem is near upon all the Goyim: as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine own head."
Ovadyah,1,16,"For as ye have drunk upon My Har Kodesh (Holy Mountain) , so shall all the Goyim drink continually; yea, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been."
Ovadyah,1,17,"But upon Mt Tziyon shall be deliverance, and there shall be kodesh (holiness) ; and the Beis Ya'akov shall possess their inheritances."
Ovadyah,1,18,"And the Beis Ya'akov shall be an eish (fire) , and the Beis Yosef a flame, and the Beis Esav for stubble, and they shall kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be any remaining of the Beis Esav; for Hashem hath spoken."
Ovadyah,1,19,"And they of the Negev shall possess Har Esav; and they of the Shefelah, the Philistines; and they shall possess the fields of Ephrayim, and the fields of Shomron; and Binyamin shall possess Gil'ad."
Ovadyah,1,20,"And those of the Golus of Bnei Yisroel shall possess that of the Kena'anim, even unto Tzarphat; and those of the Golus of Yerushalayim, which is in Sepharad, shall possess the cities of the Negev."
Ovadyah,1,21,And Moshi'im (Deliverers) shall come up on Mt Tziyon to judge the Har Esav; and HaMamlachah (the Kingdom) shall be Hashem ʼs.
