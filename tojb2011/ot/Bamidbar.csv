Bamidbar,5,9,"And every terumah of all the holy things of the Bnei Yisroel, which they bring unto the kohen, shall be his."
Bamidbar,5,10,"And every man ºs things set apart as kodesh shall be his; whatsoever any man giveth the kohen, it shall be his."
Bamidbar,5,11,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe, saying,"
Bamidbar,5,12,"Speak unto the Bnei Yisroel, and say unto them, If any man ºs isha go aside, and commit a trespass against him,"
Bamidbar,5,13,"And a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her ish, and she become tameh secretly, and there be no ed (witness) against her, neither she be caught;"
Bamidbar,5,14,"And a ruach kina (spirit of jealousy) come upon him, and he be jealous of his isha, and she be tameh; or if a ruach kina come upon him, and he be jealous of his isha, and she be not tameh;"
Bamidbar,5,15,"Then shall the ish bring his isha unto the kohen, and he shall bring her korban for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no shemen upon it, nor put incense thereon; for it is a minchat kenaot (grain offering of jealousies) , a minchat zikaron (grain offering of memorial) , bringing avon to remembrance."
Bamidbar,5,16,"And the kohen shall bring her near, and set her before Hashem;"
Bamidbar,5,17,"And the kohen shall take mayim kedoshim in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is in the floor of the Mishkan the kohen shall take, and put it into the mayim;"
Bamidbar,5,18,"And the kohen shall set the isha before Hashem , and unbind the hair of the isha, and put the minchat hazikaron in her hands, which is the minchat kena'ot; and the kohen shall have in his hand the mei hamarim hame'ararim (waters of bitterness that causeth the curse);"
Bamidbar,5,19,"And the kohen shall put her under oath, and say unto the isha, If no man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not turned astray to tum'a (uncleanness, impurity) with another instead of thy husband, be thou free from these mei hamarim hame'ararim;"
Bamidbar,5,20,"But if thou hast turned astray to another instead of thy ish, and if thou be defiled, and some man have lain with thee other than thine ish;"
Bamidbar,5,21,"Then the kohen shall put the isha under oath with the oath of the curse, and the kohen shall say unto the isha, Hashem make thee an alah (curse) and a shevu'ah (oath) among thy people, when Hashem doth make thy thigh to waste away, and thy belly to swell;"
Bamidbar,5,22,"And this mayim that causeth the curse shall go into thy inner parts, to make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to waste away; And the isha shall say, Omen, Omen."
Bamidbar,5,23,"And the kohen shall write these alot (curses) on a sefer, and he shall wash them into the mei hamarim;"
Bamidbar,5,24,"And he shall cause the isha to drink the mei hamarim hame'ararim; and the mayim hame'ararim shall enter into her, and become bitter."
Bamidbar,5,25,"Then the kohen shall take the minchat hakena'ot out of the yad haisha, and shall wave the minchah before Hashem , and offer it upon the Mizbe'ach:"
Bamidbar,5,26,"And the kohen shall take a handful of the minchah, even the memorial thereof, and burn it upon the Mizbe'ach, and afterward shall cause the isha to drink the mayim."
Bamidbar,5,27,"And when he hath made her to drink the mayim, then it shall come to pass, that, if she be defiled, and have done trespass against her ish, that the mayim hame'ararim shall enter into her, and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall waste away; and the isha shall become a curse among her people."
Bamidbar,5,28,"And if the isha be not defiled, but be tehorah (clean) ; then she shall be free, and shall conceive zera."
Bamidbar,5,29,"This is the torat hakena'ot (law of jealousy) , when an isha goeth astray to another instead of her ish, and is defiled;"
Bamidbar,5,30,"Or when the ruach kinah cometh upon him, and he be jealous over his isha, and shall set the isha before Hashem , and the kohen shall execute upon her all this torah."
Bamidbar,5,31,"Then shall the ish be free from guilt from avon, and this isha shall bear her avon."
Bamidbar,6,1,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe, saying,"
Bamidbar,6,2,"Speak unto the Bnei Yisroel, and say unto them, When either ish or isha shall separate themselves to vow a neder of a Nazir, to separate themselves unto Hashem;"
Bamidbar,6,3,"He shall separate himself from yayin and shechar (fermented drink) , and shall drink no chometz (vinegar) of yayin, or chometz of shechar, neither shall he drink any grape juice, nor eat moist grapes, or dried."
Bamidbar,6,4,"Kol hayamim of his nazir (vow as a nazir) shall he eat nothing that is made of the gefen hayayin, from the seeds even to the grape-skins."
Bamidbar,6,5,"Kol hayamim of the neder of his nazir there shall no razor come upon his head; until hayamim be fulfilled, in the which he separateth himself unto Hashem , he shall be kadosh, and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow."
Bamidbar,6,6,Kol yemei of his nezer (abstinence) unto Hashem he shall go not near nefesh met (dead body).
Bamidbar,6,7,"He shall not make himself tameh for his av, or for his em, for his ach, or for his achot, when they die; because the Nezer Elohav (Consecration of his G-d) is upon his head."
Bamidbar,6,8,Kol yemei of his nazir (separation) he is kadosh unto Hashem.
Bamidbar,6,9,"And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he hath made tameh the head of his nezer (abstinence) ; then he shall shave his head in the yom of his tohorah, on the yom hashevi'i shall he shave it."
Bamidbar,6,10,"And on the yom hashemi'ni he shall bring two doves, or two young pigeons, to the kohen, to the entrance of the Ohel Mo'ed;"
Bamidbar,6,11,"And the kohen shall offer the one for a chattat (sin offering) , and the other for an olah (burnt offering) , and make kapporah for him, because he sinned by the nefesh (dead body) , and shall make kadosh his head that same day."
Bamidbar,6,12,"And he shall consecrate unto Hashem the yemei of his nazir, and shall bring a lamb of the first year for an asham (trespass offering) ; but the yamim harishonim shall not be counted, because his nazir was tameh."
Bamidbar,6,13,"And this is the Torat HaNazir, when the yamim of his nazir are fulfilled: he shall be brought unto the entrance of the Ohel Mo'ed;"
Bamidbar,6,14,"And he shall offer his korban unto Hashem , one he-lamb of the first year tamim (without blemish) for an olah (burnt offering) , and one ewe lamb of the first year temimah (without blemish) for a chattat, and one ram tamim (without blemish) for shelamim (peace offerings),"
Bamidbar,6,15,"And a basket of matzot, cakes of fine flour mingled with shemen, and wafers of matzot meshuchim (anointed) with oil, and their minchot (grain offerings) , and their nesakhim (drink offerings)."
Bamidbar,6,16,"And the kohen shall bring them before Hashem , and shall offer his chattat, and his olah (burnt offering);"
Bamidbar,6,17,"And he shall offer the ram for a zevach shelamim (sacrifice of peace offerings) unto Hashem , with the basket of matzot; the kohen shall offer also his minchah (grain offering) , and his nesekh (drink offering)."
Bamidbar,6,18,"And the Nazir shall shave the head of his nezer at the entrance of the Ohel Mo'ed, and shall take the hair of the head of his nezer, and put it in the eish (fire) which is under the zevach hashelamim (sacrifice of peace offerings)."
Bamidbar,6,19,"And the kohen shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram, and one challat matzah (loaf of matzah) out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazir, after the hair of his nezer (abstinence) is shaven;"
Bamidbar,6,20,"And the kohen shall wave them for a wave offering before Hashem ; this is kodesh for the kohen, with the breast of the wave offering and thigh of the terumah (raised-up presentation) ; and after that the Nazir may drink yayin."
Bamidbar,6,21,"This is the Torat HaNazir who hath vowed, and of his korban unto Hashem for his nezer (abstinence) , in addition to whatever else his hand shall afford, according to the neder (vow) which he vowed, so he must do after the torah of his Nazir."
Bamidbar,6,22,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe, saying,"
Bamidbar,6,23,"Speak unto Aharon and unto his Banim, saying, On this wise ye shall bless the Bnei Yisroel, saying unto them,"
Bamidbar,6,24,"Y'varekhekha Adonai v'yishmerekha( Hashem bless thee, and keep thee);"
Bamidbar,6,25,"Ya'er Adonai panav eleikha vichunekha( Hashem make His face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee);"
Bamidbar,6,26,"Yissa Adonai panav eleikha v'yasem l'kha shalom( Hashem lift up His countenance upon thee, and give thee shalom)."
Bamidbar,6,27,"And they shall put My Shem upon the Bnei Yisroel, and I will bless them."
Bamidbar,7,1,"And it came to pass on the day that Moshe had fully set up the Mishkan, and had anointed it, and set it apart as kodesh, and all the instruments thereof, both the Mizbe'ach and all the vessels thereof, and had anointed them, and set them apart as kodesh,"
Bamidbar,7,2,"That the Nasiim (Rulers) of Yisroel, heads of the Bais of their Avot, who were the Nasiim of the tribes, and were over them that were numbered, offered;"
Bamidbar,7,3,"And they brought their korban before Hashem , six covered carts, and twelve oxen; a cart for two of the Nasiim, and for each one an ox; and they brought them before the Mishkan."
Bamidbar,7,4,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe, saying,"
Bamidbar,7,5,"Take it of them, that they may be for the service of the Ohel Mo'ed; and thou shalt give them unto the Levi'im, to every man according to his service."

Bamidbar,7,8,"And four carts and eight oxen he gave unto the Bnei Merari, according unto their service, under the hand of Itamar ben Aharon HaKohen."
Bamidbar,7,9,"But unto the Bnei Kehat he gave none, because the service of HaKodesh belonging unto them was that they should bear upon their shoulders."

Bamidbar,8,12,"And the Levi'im shall lay their hands upon the rosh of the bulls; and thou shalt offer the one for a chattat, and the other for an olah, unto Hashem , to make kapporah for the Levi'im."
Bamidbar,8,13,"And thou shalt set the Levi'im before Aharon, and before his Banim, and offer them for a tenufah unto Hashem."
Bamidbar,8,14,Thus shalt thou set apart as separate the Levi'im from among the Bnei Yisroel; and the Levi'im shall be Mine.
Bamidbar,8,15,And after that shall the Levi'im go in to do the service of the Ohel Mo'ed; and thou shalt make them tahor and offer them for a tenufah.
Bamidbar,8,16,"For they are wholly given unto Me from among the Bnei Yisroel; instead of such as open every womb, even instead of the Bechor Kol Bnei Yisroel, have I taken them unto Me."
Bamidbar,8,17,"For Kol Bechor Bnei Yisroel are Mine, both adam and behemah; on the day that I struck down kol bechor in Eretz Mitzrayim I set them apart as kodesh for Myself."
Bamidbar,8,18,And I have taken the Levi'im takhat (instead of) Kol Bechor Bnei Yisroel.
Bamidbar,8,19,"And I have given the Levi'im as a gift to Aharon and to his Banim from among the Bnei Yisroel, to do the Avodat Bnei Yisroel in the Ohel Mo'ed, and to make kapporah for the Bnei Yisroel; so that there be no plague among the Bnei Yisroel, when the Bnei Yisroel come near unto HaKodesh."
Bamidbar,8,20,"And Moshe, and Aharon, and Kol Adat Bnei Yisroel, did with the Levi'im according unto all that Hashem commanded Moshe concerning the Levi'im, so did the Bnei Yisroel unto them."
Bamidbar,8,21,"And the Levi'im purified themselves, and they immersed their clothes; and Aharon offered them as a tenufah before Hashem ; and Aharon made kapporah for them to make them tahor."
Bamidbar,8,22,"And after that went the Levi'im in to do their Avodah in the Ohel Mo'ed before Aharon, and before his Banim; just as Hashem had commanded Moshe concerning the Levi'im, so did they with them."
Bamidbar,8,23,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe, saying,"
Bamidbar,8,24,This is it that belongeth unto the Levi'im: from twenty and five years old and upward they shall enter to perform service in the Avodat Ohel Mo'ed;
Bamidbar,8,25,And from the age of fifty years they shall retire from the service of the Avodah and shall serve no more;
Bamidbar,8,26,"But shall assist with their brethren in the Ohel Mo'ed, in performing their duties, and shall do no Avodah. Thus shalt thou do with the Levi'im regarding their duties."
Bamidbar,9,1,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe in the Midbar Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of Eretz Mitzrayim, saying,"
Bamidbar,9,2,Let the Bnei Yisroel also observe the Pesach at its appointed season.
Bamidbar,9,3,"In the fourteenth day of this month, at twilight, ye shall observe it in its appointed season; according to kol chukkot of it, according to all the mishpatim thereof, shall ye observe it."
Bamidbar,9,4,"And Moshe spoke unto the Bnei Yisroel, that they should observe the Pesach."
Bamidbar,9,5,"And they observed the Pesach on the fourteenth day of the first month at twilight in the Midbar Sinai; according to all that Hashem commanded Moshe, so did the Bnei Yisroel."
Bamidbar,9,6,"And there were certain men, who were teme'im by the nefesh (dead body) of an adam, that they could not observe the Pesach on that day; and they came before Moshe and before Aharon on that day;"
Bamidbar,9,7,"And those men said unto him, We are teme'im (unclean) by the nefesh of a man; but why should we be kept back, that we may not offer a korban Hashem in its appointed season among the Bnei Yisroel?"
Bamidbar,9,8,"And Moshe said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what Hashem will command concerning you."
Bamidbar,9,9,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe, saying,"
Bamidbar,9,10,"Speak unto the Bnei Yisroel, saying, If any man of you or of your descendants shall be tamei by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall observe the Pesach unto Hashem."
Bamidbar,9,11,"The fourteenth day of the second month at twilight they shall observe it, and eat it with matzot and merorim (bitter herbs)."
Bamidbar,9,12,"They shall leave none of it unto boker, nor break any bone of it; according to all the chukkat of the Pesach they shall observe it."
Bamidbar,9,13,"But the man that is tahor, and is not in a journey, and faileth to observe the Pesach, even the same nefesh shall be cut off from among his people; because he brought not the korban Hashem at its appointed time, that man shall bear his sin."
Bamidbar,9,14,"And if a ger shall stay for a while among you, and will observe the Pesach unto Hashem ; according to the chukkat of the Pesach, and according to the mishpat thereof, so shall he do; ye shall have one chukkat, both for the ger, and for him that was born in the land."
Bamidbar,9,15,"And on the day that the Mishkan was set up the Anan covered the Mishkan, namely, the Ohel HaEdut; and at erev there was upon the Mishkan as it were the appearance of eish, until boker."
Bamidbar,9,16,"So it was tamid: the Anan covered it by day, and the appearance of eish by lailah."
Bamidbar,9,17,"And when the Anan was lifted up from the Ohel, then after that the Bnei Yisroel set out; and in the place where the Anan abode, there the Bnei Yisroel encamped."
Bamidbar,9,18,"At the mouth of Hashem the Bnei Yisroel set out, and at the mouth of Hashem they encamped; as long as the Anan abode upon the Mishkan they encamped."
Bamidbar,9,19,"And when the Anan tarried long upon the Mishkan many days, then the Bnei Yisroel obeyed the order of Hashem , and did not set out."
Bamidbar,9,20,"And so it was, when the Anan was a few days upon the Mishkan; according to the mouth of Hashem they encamped; according to the mouth of Hashem they set out."
Bamidbar,9,21,"And so it was, when the Anan abode from erev unto boker, and that the Anan was lifted up in the boker, then they set out; whether it was by yomam valailah that the Anan was lifted up, they set out."
Bamidbar,9,22,"Or whether it were two days, or a month, or longer, that the Anan tarried over the Mishkan remaining thereon, the Bnei Yisroel abode in their tents, and did not set out; but when it was lifted up, they set out."
Bamidbar,9,23,"At the mouth of Hashem they encamped, and at the mouth of Hashem they set out; they obeyed the order of Hashem , at the mouth of Hashem by the hand of Moshe."
Bamidbar,10,1,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe, saying,"
Bamidbar,10,2,"Make thee two khatzotzerot (trumpets) of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou make them; that thou mayest use them for the calling of the Edah, and for the setting out of the machanot."
Bamidbar,10,3,"And when they shall sound them, Kol HaEdah shall assemble themselves to thee at the entrance of the Ohel Mo'ed."
Bamidbar,10,4,"And if they sound but with one, then the Nasi'im, which are heads of Yisroel ºs thousands, shall gather themselves unto thee."
Bamidbar,10,5,"When ye sound a teruah, then the machanot that camp on the east shall go forward."
Bamidbar,10,6,"When ye sound a teruah the second time, then the machanot that camp on the south shall set out; they shall sound a teruah for their settings out."
Bamidbar,10,7,"But when the Kahal is to be gathered together, ye shall sound it, but ye shall not sound a teruah."
Bamidbar,10,8,"And the Bnei Aharon, the kohanim, shall sound the khatzotzerot; and they shall be to you for a chukkat olam throughout your dorot."
Bamidbar,10,9,"And if ye go into milchamah (battle) in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you, then ye shall sound a blast on the khatzotzerot; and ye shall be remembered before Hashem Eloheichem, and ye shall be saved from your enemies."
Bamidbar,10,10,"Also in the day of your simcha, and in your moadim, and in the Rosh-Chodesh, ye shall sound a blast on the khatzotzerot over your olot, and over the zevakhim of your shelamim; that they may be to you for a memorial reminder before Eloheichem: I am Hashem Eloheichem."
Bamidbar,10,11,"And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year, that the Anan was lifted up from off the Mishkan HaEdut."
Bamidbar,10,12,And the Bnei Yisroel set out in their travels from the Midbar Sinai; and the Anan rested in the Midbar Paran.
Bamidbar,10,13,And they first set out according to the mouth of Hashem by the hand of Moshe.
Bamidbar,10,14,First in place went the degel of the machaneh of the Bnei Yehudah according to their tzivos; and over his division was Nachshon ben Amminadav.
Bamidbar,10,15,And over the division of the tribe of the Bnei Yissakhar was Netanel ben Tzuar.
Bamidbar,10,16,And over the division of the tribe of the Bnei Zevulun was Eliav ben Chelon.
Bamidbar,10,17,"And the Mishkan was taken down; and the Bnei Gershon and the Bnei Merari set out, bearing the Mishkan."
Bamidbar,10,18,And the degel of the machaneh of Reuven set out according to their tzivos (armies) ; and over his division was Elitzur ben Shede'ur.
Bamidbar,10,19,And over the division of the tribe of the Bnei Shim'on was Shelumiel ben Tzurishaddai.
Bamidbar,10,20,And over the division of the tribe of the Bnei Gad was Elyasaph ben De'uel.
Bamidbar,10,21,"And the descendants of Kehat set out, bearing the Mikdash; and they would erect the Mishkan before their arrival."
Bamidbar,10,22,And the degel of the machaneh of the Bnei Ephrayim set out according to their tzivos (armies) ; and over his division was Elishama ben Ammihud.
Bamidbar,10,23,And over the division of the tribe of the Bnei Menasheh was Gamli'el ben Pedahtzur.
Bamidbar,10,24,And over the division of the tribe of the Bnei Binyamin was Avidan ben Gideoni.
Bamidbar,10,25,"And the degel of the machaneh of the Bnei Dan set out, which formed the rear guard of all the machanot throughout their tzivos; and over his division was Achi'ezer ben Ammishaddai."
Bamidbar,10,26,And over the division of the tribe of the Bnei Asher was Pagiel ben Okhran.
Bamidbar,10,27,And over the division of the tribe of the Bnei Naphtali was Achira ben Enan.
Bamidbar,10,28,"Thus was the order of march of the Bnei Yisroel according to their tzivos (armies) , when they set out."
Bamidbar,10,29,"And Moshe said unto Chovav ben Reuel the Midyani, Moshe ºs khoten (father-in-law) , We are traveling unto the place of which Hashem said, I will give it you: Come thou with us, and we will do thee good; for Hashem hath promised tov concerning Yisroel."
Bamidbar,10,30,"And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine own land, and to my moledet."
Bamidbar,10,31,"And he said, Leave us not, please; forasmuch as thou hast da'as how we are to encamp in the midbar, and thou mayest be to us as eyes."
Bamidbar,10,32,"And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what tov Hashem shall do unto us, the same will we share with thee."
Bamidbar,10,33,"And they departed from the Mountain of Hashem three days º journey; the Aron Brit Hashem went before them in the three days º derech, to search out a menuchah for them."
Bamidbar,10,34,"And the Anan of Hashem was upon them by day, when they set out from the machaneh."
Bamidbar,10,35,"And it came to pass, when the Aron set out, that Moshe said, Rise up, Hashem , and let Thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate Thee flee before Thee."
Bamidbar,10,36,"And when it rested, he said, Return, Hashem , unto the countless thousands of Yisroel."
Bamidbar,11,1,"And when the people complained, it displeased Hashem; Hashem heard it; His anger was kindled; and the Eish Hashem burned among them, and consumed them that were at the edge of the machaneh."
Bamidbar,11,2,"And the people cried unto Moshe; and when Moshe davened unto Hashem , the eish was quenched."
Bamidbar,11,3,He called shem hamakom Taverah because the Eish Hashem burned among them.
Bamidbar,11,4,"And the rabble that was among them fell a-lusting; and the Bnei Yisroel also wept again, and said, If only we had basar to eat!"
Bamidbar,11,5,"We remember the fish, which we did eat in Mitzrayim at no cost; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic;"
Bamidbar,11,6,"But now our nefesh is dried up; there is nothing at all, besides this manna, before our eyes."
Bamidbar,11,7,"And the manna was like coriander seed, and the color thereof like the color of white gum resin."
Bamidbar,11,8,"And the people went about and gathered it, and ground it in handmills, or crushed it in the mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it; and the taste of it was like the taste of cakes prepared of shemen."
Bamidbar,11,9,"And when the dew fell upon the machaneh in the lailah, the manna fell with it."
Bamidbar,11,10,"Then Moshe heard the people wailing throughout their mishpekhot, every man in the entrance of his ohel; and the anger of Hashem was kindled greatly; Moshe also was displeased."
Bamidbar,11,11,"And Moshe said unto Hashem , Why hast Thou afflicted Thy eved? And why have I not found chen (favor) in Thy sight, that Thou layest the massa (burden) of all this people upon me?"
Bamidbar,11,12,"Have I conceived all this people? Have I fathered them, that Thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as the one nursing beareth the nursing infant, unto the land which Thou didst swear unto their avot?"
Bamidbar,11,13,"Where should I get basar to give unto all this people? For they wail unto me, saying, Give us basar, that we may eat."
Bamidbar,11,14,"I am not able to carry all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me."
Bamidbar,11,15,"And if Thou deal thus with me, kill me, please, at once, if I have found chen in Thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness."
Bamidbar,11,16,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, Gather unto Me seventy men of the Zekenim of Yisroel, whom thou knowest to be the Ziknei HaAm, and officers over them; and bring them unto the Ohel Mo'ed, that they may stand there with thee."
Bamidbar,11,17,"And I will come down and speak with thee there; and I will take of the Ruach that is upon thee, and will put upon them; and they shall bear the massa HaAm (burden of the People) with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone."
Bamidbar,11,18,"And say thou unto the people, Set yourselves apart as kodesh against tomorrow, and ye shall eat basar; for ye have wept in the ears of Hashem , saying, Who shall give us basar to eat? For it was well with us in Mitzrayim; therefore Hashem will give you basar, and ye shall eat."
Bamidbar,11,19,"Lo (not) ye shall eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days;"
Bamidbar,11,20,"But even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you; because that meastem (ye have rejected) Hashem Who is among you, and have wept before Him, saying, Why came we forth out of Mitzrayim?"
Bamidbar,11,21,"And Moshe said, The people, among whom I am, are 600,000 men on foot; and Thou hast said, I will give them basar, that they may eat a whole month."
Bamidbar,11,22,"Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice them? Or shall all the dag (fish) of the yam be gathered together for them, to suffice them?"
Bamidbar,11,23,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, Is the Yad Hashem cut short? Thou shalt see now whether My Devar shall come to pass unto thee or not."
Bamidbar,11,24,"And Moshe went out, and told HaAm the divrei Hashem , and gathered the seventy men of the Ziknei HaAm, and set them round about the Ohel [Moed]."
Bamidbar,11,25,"And Hashem came down in an Anan, and spoke unto him, and took of the Ruach that was upon him, and gave unto the seventy Zekenim; and it came to pass, that, when the Ruach rested upon them, they prophesied, but did not continue."
Bamidbar,11,26,"But there remained two of the anashim in the machaneh, the shem of the one was Eldad, and the shem of the other Medad: and the Ruach rested upon them; and they were of them that were listed, but went not out unto the Ohel [Moed]; and they prophesied in the machaneh."
Bamidbar,11,27,"And there ran a young man, and told Moshe, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the machaneh."
Bamidbar,11,28,"And Yehoshua Ben Nun, the mesharet Moshe, one of his chosen young men, answered and said, Moshe adoni, forbid them."
Bamidbar,11,29,"And Moshe said unto him, Are you jealous for my sake? If only kol Am Hashem were neviim, and that Hashem would put His Ruach upon them!"
Bamidbar,11,30,"And Moshe went back to the machaneh, he and the Ziknei Yisroel."
Bamidbar,11,31,"And there went forth a wind from Hashem , it drove in quail from the yam, brought them down over the machaneh at a height of two cubits from the ground for the distance of a day ºs journey all around the machaneh."
Bamidbar,11,32,"And the people stood up all that yom, and kol halailah, and all the next day, and they gathered in the quail; he that gathered least gathered ten chomers; and they spread them all out for themselves round about the machaneh."
Bamidbar,11,33,"And while the basar was yet between their teeth, before it was chewed, the wrath of Hashem was kindled against the people, and Hashem struck down the people with a makkah rabbah me'od (a very great plague)."
Bamidbar,11,34,And the shem of that place was called Kivrot-Hata'avah (graves of greed) because there they buried the people that lusted.
Bamidbar,11,35,And the people set out from Kivrot-Hata'avah unto Chatzerot; and abode at Chatzerot.
Bamidbar,12,1,And Miryam and Aharon spoke against Moshe because of the Cushite woman whom he had married; for he had married a Kushite woman.
Bamidbar,12,2,"And they said, Hath Hashem indeed spoken only by Moshe? Hath He not spoken also by us? And Hashem heard it."
Bamidbar,12,3," (Now the man Moshe was anav me'od, above all the men which were upon the face of ha'adamah.)"
Bamidbar,12,4,"And Hashem spoke suddenly unto Moshe, and unto Aharon, and unto Miryam, Come out ye three unto the Ohel Mo'ed. And they three came out."
Bamidbar,12,5,"And Hashem came down in an Ammud Anan, and stood in the entrance of the Ohel, and He called Aharon and Miryam; and they both came forth."
Bamidbar,12,6,"And He said, Hear now My words: If there be a navi among you, I Hashem will reveal Myself unto him in a mar'ah (vision) , and will speak unto him in a chalom."
Bamidbar,12,7,"Avdi Moshe is not so, who is ne'eman (faithful) in all Mine Bais."
Bamidbar,12,8,"With him will I speak peh el peh, plainly, and not in dark sayings; and the temuna (form) of Hashem shall he behold; why then were ye not afraid to speak against Avdi Moshe?"
Bamidbar,12,9,And the anger of Hashem was kindled against them; and He departed.
Bamidbar,12,10,"And the Anan departed from off the Ohel [Moed]; and, hinei, Miryam became metzora'at (leprous) , white as snow: and Aharon looked upon Miryam, and, hinei, she was metzora'at."
Bamidbar,12,11,"And Aharon said unto Moshe, Alas, adoni, I beseech thee, hold not the chattat (sin) against us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we have sinned."
Bamidbar,12,12,"Let her not be as one dead, of whom the basar is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother ºs womb."
Bamidbar,12,13,"And Moshe cried unto Hashem , saying, El (G-d) , refah (heal) her now, I beseech thee."
Bamidbar,12,14,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, If her av had but spit in her face, should she not be in disgrace seven days? Let her be exiled from the machaneh seven days, and after that let her be received in again."
Bamidbar,12,15,And Miryam was exiled from the machaneh seven days; and HaAm did not set out till Miryam was received in again.
Bamidbar,12,16,"And afterward HaAm removed from Chatzerot, and encamped in the Midbar Paran."
Bamidbar,13,1,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe, saying,"
Bamidbar,13,2,"Send thou anashim, that they may spy out Eretz Kena'an, which I give unto the Bnei Yisroel: of every tribe of their avot shall ye send a man, every one a nasi among them."
Bamidbar,13,3,And Moshe by the mouth of Hashem sent them from the Midbar Paran; all those men were Roshei Bnei Yisroel.
Bamidbar,13,4,"And these were their shmot: of the tribe of Reuven, Shammua ben Zakur."
Bamidbar,13,5,"Of the tribe of Shim'on, Shaphat ben Chori."
Bamidbar,13,6,"Of the tribe of Yehudah, Kalev ben Yephunneh."
Bamidbar,13,7,"Of the tribe of Yissakhar, Yigal ben Yosef."
Bamidbar,13,8,"Of the tribe of Ephrayim, Hoshea ben Nun."
Bamidbar,13,9,"Of the tribe of Binyamin, Palti ben Raphu."
Bamidbar,13,10,"Of the tribe of Zevulun, Gaddiel ben Sodi."
Bamidbar,13,11,"Of the tribe of Yosef, namely, of the tribe of Menasheh, Gaddi ben Susi."
Bamidbar,13,12,"Of the tribe of Dan, Ammi'el ben Gemalli."
Bamidbar,13,13,"Of the tribe of Asher, Setur ben Micha'el."
Bamidbar,13,14,"Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nachbi ben Vophsi."
Bamidbar,13,15,"Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel ben Machi."
Bamidbar,13,16,These are the shmot of the men which Moshe sent to spy out the land. And Moshe called Hoshea ben Nun Yehoshua.
Bamidbar,13,17,"And Moshe sent them to spy out Eretz Kena'an, and said unto them, Get you up to the Negev, and go up into the mountain;"
Bamidbar,13,18,"And see the land, what it is like, and the people that dwelleth therein, whether they be strong or weak, few or many;"
Bamidbar,13,19,"And what the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad; and what cities they be that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strongholds;"
Bamidbar,13,20,"And what the land is, whether it be fertile or barren, whether there be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the first ripe grapes."
Bamidbar,13,21,"So they went up, and searched the land from the midbar of Tzin unto Rechov, as men come to Chamat."
Bamidbar,13,22,"And they ascended by the south, and came unto Chevron; where Achiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the Anak, were. (Now Chevron was built seven shanim before Tzoan in Mitzrayim.)"
Bamidbar,13,23,"And they came unto the Wadi Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with cluster of anavim echad, and they bore it between two upon a staff; and they brought of the pomegranates, and of the figs."
Bamidbar,13,24,"The place was called the Wadi Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the Bnei Yisroel cut down from thence."
Bamidbar,13,25,And they returned from searching of the land after arba'im days.
Bamidbar,13,26,"And they went and came to Moshe, and to Aharon, and to all the congregation of the Bnei Yisroel, unto the Midbar Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto Kol HaEdah, and showed them the pri ha'aretz."
Bamidbar,13,27,"And they told him, and said, We came unto ha'aretz where thou didst send us, and truly it floweth with cholov and devash; and this is the fruit of it."
Bamidbar,13,28,"Nevertheless the people are strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are walled, and gedolot me'od; and moreover we saw the Anak there."
Bamidbar,13,29,"The Amalek dwell in the eretz of the Negev; and the Chitti, and the Yevusi, and the Emori, dwell in the hills; and the Kena'ani dwell by the yam, and by the bank of the Yarden."
Bamidbar,13,30,"And Kalev silenced HaAm before Moshe, and said, Let us go up at once, and take possession of it; for we are well able to overcome it."
Bamidbar,13,31,"But the anashim that went up with him said, We are not able to go up against the people; for they are chazak (stronger) than we."
Bamidbar,13,32,"And they spread an evil report of HaAretz which they had explored unto the Bnei Yisroel, saying, HaAretz, through which we have gone to explore it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature."
Bamidbar,13,33,"And there we saw the Nephilim, the Bnei Anak, which come of the Nephilim; and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight."
Bamidbar,14,1,"And Kol HaEdah lifted up their voice, and cried; and HaAm wept that night."
Bamidbar,14,2,"And Kol Bnei Yisroel murmured against Moshe and against Aharon: and the Kol HaEdah said unto them, If only we had died in Eretz Mitzrayim! Or if only we had died in this midbar!"
Bamidbar,14,3,"And why hath Hashem brought us unto this land, to fall by the cherev, that nasheinu (our wives) and our children should be as plunder? Were it not better for us to go back unto Mitzrayim?"
Bamidbar,14,4,"And they said one to another, Let us make a Rosh (Leader) , and let us go back unto Mitzrayim."
Bamidbar,14,5,Then Moshe and Aharon fell on their faces before Kol Kehal Adat Bnei Yisroel.
Bamidbar,14,6,"And Yehoshua ben Nun, and Kalev ben Yephunneh, which were of them that explored HaAretz, tore their clothes:"
Bamidbar,14,7,"And they spoke unto Kol Adat Bnei Yisroel, saying, HaAretz, which we passed through to explore it, is a tovah haaretz me'od me'od."
Bamidbar,14,8,"If Hashem delight in us, then He will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land zavat cholov udevash."
Bamidbar,14,9,"Only rebel not ye against Hashem , neither fear ye the Am HaAretz; for they are lachmeinu (our bread) : their protection is departed from them, and Hashem is with us: fear them not."
Bamidbar,14,10,But Kol HaEdah talked of stoning them with avanim. And the Kavod Hashem appeared in the Ohel Mo'ed before Kol Bnei Yisroel.
Bamidbar,14,11,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, How long will this people treat Me with contempt? And how long will it be until they believe in Me, for all the otot which I have performed among them?"
Bamidbar,14,12,"I will strike them down with dever (pestilence) , and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they."
Bamidbar,14,13,"And Moshe said unto Hashem , Then the Egyptians shall hear it, (for Thou broughtest up this people in Thy ko'ach [might] from among them;)"
Bamidbar,14,14,"And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land; for they have heard that Thou Hashem art among this people, that Thou Hashem art seen eye to eye, and that Thy Anan standeth over them, and that Thou goest before them, by day in an Ammud Anan, and in an Ammud Eish by night."
Bamidbar,14,15,"Now if Thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the Goyim which have heard the fame of Thee will speak, saying,"
Bamidbar,14,16,"Because Hashem was not able to bring this people into HaAretz which He promised them by oath, therefore He hath slaughtered (shachat) them in the midbar."
Bamidbar,14,17,"And now, I beseech thee, let the Ko'ach Adonoi be great, according as Thou hast spoken, saying,"
Bamidbar,14,18," Hashem is slow of anger, and of rav chesed, forgiving avon and peysha, and by no means exonerating the guilty, visiting the avon of the avot upon the banim unto the third and fourth generation."
Bamidbar,14,19,"Selach (forgive!) , I beseech thee, the avon of this people according unto the greatness of Thy chesed, just as Thou hast forgiven this people, from Mitzrayim even until now."
Bamidbar,14,20,"And Hashem said, I have pardoned according to thy word:"
Bamidbar,14,21,"But as surely as I live, Kol HaAretz (all the Earth) shall be filled with the Kavod Hashem."
Bamidbar,14,22,"Because all those men which have seen My kavod, and My otot (miraculous signs) , which I performed in Mitzrayim and in the midbar, and have tested Me now these ten times, and have not paid heed to My voice;"
Bamidbar,14,23,"Surely they shall not see HaAretz which I swore unto their avot, neither shall any of them that treated Me with contempt see it:"
Bamidbar,14,24,"But Avdi Kalev, because he hath a ruach acheret in him, and hath followed after Me fully, him will I bring into HaAretz whereinto he went; and his zera shall inherit it."
Bamidbar,14,25, (Now the Amaleki and the Kena'ani dwelt in the valley.) Tomorrow turn and get you into the midbar by the way of the Yam Suf.
Bamidbar,14,26,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe and unto Aharon, saying,"
Bamidbar,14,27,"How long shall I bear with this Edah Hara'ah, which murmur against Me? I have heard the murmurings of the Bnei Yisroel, which they murmur against Me."
Bamidbar,14,28,"Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith Hashem , as ye have spoken in Mine ears, so will I do to you:"
Bamidbar,14,29,"Your corpses shall fall in this midbar; and all that were numbered of you, according to your entire mispar (number, census) , from twenty years old and upward which have murmured against Me."
Bamidbar,14,30,"Not one of you shall come into HaAretz, concerning which I swore to make you dwell therein, except for Kalev ben Yephunneh, and Yehoshua ben Nun."
Bamidbar,14,31,"But your little ones, which ye said would be plunder, them will I bring in, and they shall know HaAretz which ye have rejected."
Bamidbar,14,32,"But as for you, your corpses, they shall fall in this midbar."
Bamidbar,14,33,"And your banim shall wander in the midbar arba'im shanah, and bear your whoredoms, until the last of your corpses lies in the midbar."
Bamidbar,14,34,"After the number of the days in which ye explored HaAretz, even arba'im, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even arba'im shanah, and ye shall know My Tenu'a (Opposition)."
Bamidbar,14,35,"I, Hashem , have spoken, I will surely do it unto this Kol HaEdah, that are gathered together against Me: in this midbar they shall come to an end, and there they shall die."
Bamidbar,14,36,"And the anashim, which Moshe sent to spy out the land, who returned, and made Kol HaEdah to murmur against him, the ones spreading a dibbah (bad report, slander) about HaAretz,"
Bamidbar,14,37,"Even those anashim that did bring up the evil report of HaAretz, died by the maggefah before Hashem."
Bamidbar,14,38,"But Yehoshua ben Nun, and Kalev ben Yephunneh survived of the anashim that went to explore HaAretz."
Bamidbar,14,39,And Moshe told these sayings unto Kol Bnei Yisroel: and HaAm mourned greatly.
Bamidbar,14,40,"And they rose up early in the boker, and went up into the height of the hill country, saying, Behold, we are here, and will go up unto the place which Hashem hath promised: for we have sinned."
Bamidbar,14,41,"And Moshe said, Why now do ye transgress the utterance of Hashem ? This will not succeed."
Bamidbar,14,42,"Go not up, for Hashem is not among you; that ye be not struck down before your enemies."
Bamidbar,14,43,"For the Amaleki and the Kena'ani are there before you, and ye shall fall by the cherev: because ye are turned away from Hashem , therefore Hashem will not be with you."
Bamidbar,14,44,"But they presumed to go up unto the ridge of the mountain: nevertheless the Aron Brit Hashem , and Moshe, departed not out of the machaneh."
Bamidbar,14,45,"Then the Amaleki came down, and the Kena'ani which dwelt in that hill country, and struck them down, and put them to rout, even unto Chormah."
Bamidbar,15,1,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe, saying,"
Bamidbar,15,2,"Speak unto the Bnei Yisroel, and say unto them, When ye be enter into Eretz Moshevoteichem (Land of your Homes) , which I give unto you,"
Bamidbar,15,3,"And will make an offering by eish unto Hashem , an olah or a zevach in performing a neder, or in a nedavah or in your mo'adim, to make a re'ach nichoach unto Hashem , of the herd or of the flock;"
Bamidbar,15,4,Then shall he that offereth his korban unto Hashem bring a minchah of a tenth ephah of flour mixed with the fourth part of a hin of shemen.
Bamidbar,15,5,"And the fourth part of a hin of yayin for a nesekh shalt thou prepare with the olah (burnt offering) or zevach, for one keves (lamb)."
Bamidbar,15,6,"Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a minchah two-tenths ephah of flour mixed with the third part of a hin of shemen."
Bamidbar,15,7,"And for a nesekh thou shalt offer the third part of an hin of yayin, for a re'ach nichoach unto Hashem."
Bamidbar,15,8,"And when thou preparest a bull for an olah (burnt offering) , or for a zevach in fulfilling a vow, or shelamim unto Hashem:"
Bamidbar,15,9,Then shall he bring with a bull a minchah of three-tenths ephah of flour mixed with half a hin of shemen.
Bamidbar,15,10,"And thou shalt bring for a nesekh half a hin of yayin, for an offering made by eish, a re'ach nichoach unto Hashem."
Bamidbar,15,11,"Thus shall it be done for one bull, or for one ram, or for a seh from the lambs, or from the goats."
Bamidbar,15,12,"According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to every one according to their mispar."
Bamidbar,15,13,"All that are native-born shall do these things after this manner, in offering an offering made by eish, of a re'ach nichoach unto Hashem."
Bamidbar,15,14,"And if a ger stays temporarily with you, or whosoever be among you in your dorot, and will offer an offering made by eish, of a re'ach nichoach unto Hashem ; as ye do, so he shall do."
Bamidbar,15,15,"One chukkah shall be both for you of the Kahal, and also for the ger that sojourneth with you, a chukkat olam in your dorot; as ye are, so shall the ger be before Hashem."
Bamidbar,15,16,"One torah and one mishpat shall be for you, and for the ger that sojourneth with you."
Bamidbar,15,17,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe, saying,"
Bamidbar,15,18,"Speak unto the Bnei Yisroel, and say unto them, When ye come into HaAretz whither I bring you,"
Bamidbar,15,19,"Then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the lechem HaAretz, ye shall offer up a terumah unto Hashem."
Bamidbar,15,20,"Ye shall offer up a challah (loaf, cake) of the first of your kneading for a terumah; as ye do the terumat goren (gift of the threshing floor) , so shall ye set it aside."
Bamidbar,15,21,Of the first of your kneading ye shall give unto Hashem a terumah in your dorot.
Bamidbar,15,22,"And if ye have sinned unintentionally, and not observed all these mitzvot, which Hashem hath spoken unto Moshe,"
Bamidbar,15,23,"Even all that Hashem hath commanded you by the hand of Moshe, from the day that Hashem commanded Moshe, and henceforward among your dorot;"
Bamidbar,15,24,"Then it shall be, if it be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of HaEdah, that Kol HaEdah shall offer one young bull for an olah, for a re'ach nichoach unto Hashem , with its minchah, and its nesekh, according to the mishpat, and one kid of the goats for a chattat."
Bamidbar,15,25,"And the kohen shall make kapporah for Kol Adat Bnei Yisroel and it shall be forgiven them; for it is shegagah (inadvertence) ; and they shall bring their korban, a sacrifice made by eish unto Hashem , and their chattat before Hashem , for their shegagah;"
Bamidbar,15,26,"And it shall be forgiven Kol Adat Bnei Yisroel, and the ger that sojourneth among them; seeing Kol HaAm were in shegagah."
Bamidbar,15,27,"And if any nefesh sin through shegagah, then he shall bring a she-goat of the first year for a chattat."
Bamidbar,15,28,"And the kohen shall make kapporah for the nefesh that was inadvertant, since he sinneth by shegagah before Hashem , to make kapporah for him; and it shall be forgiven him."
Bamidbar,15,29,"Ye shall have one torah for him that sinneth through ignorance, both for him that is born among the Bnei Yisroel, and for the ger that sojourneth among them."
Bamidbar,15,30,"But the nefesh that sinneth with a yad ramah (high hand, defiantly) , whether he be born in the land, or a ger, the same blasphemes Hashem ; and that nefesh shall be cut off from among his people."
Bamidbar,15,31,"Because he hath despised the Devar Hashem , and hath broken His mitzvah, that nefesh shall utterly be cut off; his avon shall be upon him."
Bamidbar,15,32,"And while the Bnei Yisroel were in the midbar, they found a man that gathered sticks on Shabbos."
Bamidbar,15,33,"And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moshe and Aharon, and unto Kol HaEdah."
Bamidbar,15,34,"And they put him under custody, because it was not declared what should be done to him."
Bamidbar,15,35,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, The man shall be surely put to death; Kol HaEdah shall stone him with avanim outside the machaneh."
Bamidbar,15,36,"And Kol HaEdah brought him outside the machaneh, and stoned him with avanim, and he died; as Hashem commanded Moshe."
Bamidbar,15,37,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe, saying,"
Bamidbar,15,38,"Speak unto the Bnei Yisroel, and bid them that they make them tzitzis on the corners of their garments throughout their dorot, and that they put upon the tzitzis of the corners a thread of turquoise wool;"
Bamidbar,15,39,"And it shall be unto you for a tzitzit, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the mitzvot Hashem , and do them; and that ye follow not after your own lev and your own eyes, after which ye used to go a-whoring:"
Bamidbar,15,40,"That ye may remember, and do all My mitzvot, and be kedoshim unto Eloheichem."
Bamidbar,15,41,"I am Hashem Eloheichem, Who brought you out of Eretz Mitzrayim, to be for you Elohim: I am Hashem Eloheichem."
Bamidbar,16,1,"Now Korach ben Yitzhar ben Kehat ben Levi, and Datan and Aviram, the Bnei Eliav, and On ben Pelet, Bnei Reuven, became insolent;"
Bamidbar,16,2,"And they rose up before Moshe, with certain of the Bnei Yisroel, two hundred and fifty Nasi'ei Edah, chosen from the assembly, men of renown;"
Bamidbar,16,3,"And they gathered themselves together against Moshe and against Aharon, and said unto them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing Kol HaEdah are Kedoshim, every one of them, and Hashem is among them; why then lift ye up yourselves above the Kehal Hashem?"
Bamidbar,16,4,"And when Moshe heard it, he fell upon his face;"
Bamidbar,16,5,"And he spoke unto Korach and unto all his edah, saying, In the boker Hashem will show who are His, and who is the kadosh; and will cause him to come near unto Him: even him whom He hath chosen will He cause to come near unto Him."
Bamidbar,16,6,"This do: take you fire pans, Korach, and all his edah;"
Bamidbar,16,7,"And put eish therein, put ketoret in them before Hashem tomorrow; it shall be that the man whom Hashem doth choose, he shall be haKadosh; ye take too much upon you, ye Bnei Levi."
Bamidbar,16,8,"And Moshe said unto Korach, Hear, now, ye Bnei Levi:"
Bamidbar,16,9,"Seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that Elohei Yisroel hath separated you from the Adat Yisroel, to bring you near to Himself to do the Avodat Mishkan Hashem , and to stand before the Edah to minister unto them?"
Bamidbar,16,10,"And He hath brought thee near to Him, and all thy brethren the Bnei Levi with thee; and seek ye the Kehunah also?"
Bamidbar,16,11,"For which cause both thou and all thy edah are gathered together against Hashem ; and what is Aharon, that ye murmur against him?"
Bamidbar,16,12,"And Moshe sent to call Datan and Aviram, the Bnei Eliav, which said, We will not come up."
Bamidbar,16,13,"Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of an Eretz zavat cholov udevash, to kill us in the midbar, yet thou also keep trying to dominate us?"
Bamidbar,16,14,"Moreover thou hast not brought us into an Eretz zavat cholov udevash, or given us nachalah of sadeh and kerem; wilt thou gouge out the eyes of these men? We will not come up."
Bamidbar,16,15,"And Moshe was very angry, and said unto Hashem , Respect not thou their minchah; I have not taken one donkey from them, neither have I wronged one of them."
Bamidbar,16,16,"And Moshe said unto Korach, Be thou and all thy edah before Hashem , thou, they, and Aharon, tomorrow;"
Bamidbar,16,17,"And take every man his fire pan, put ketoret in them, and bring ye before Hashem every man his fire pan, 250 fire pans; thou also, and Aharon, each of you his fire pan."
Bamidbar,16,18,"And they took every man his fire pan and put eish in them and laid ketoret thereon, and stood in the entrance of the Ohel Mo'ed with Moshe and Aharon."
Bamidbar,16,19,And Korach gathered kol haedah against them unto the entrance of the Ohel Mo'ed; and the Kavod Hashem appeared unto Kol HaEdah.
Bamidbar,16,20,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe and unto Aharon, saying,"
Bamidbar,16,21,"Separate yourselves from among this edah, that I may consume them in a moment."
Bamidbar,16,22,"And they fell upon their faces, and said, El Elohei HaRuchot L'Chol Basar, shall one man sin, and wilt Thou be angry with Kol HaEdah?"
Bamidbar,16,23,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe, saying,"
Bamidbar,16,24,"Speak unto HaEdah, saying, Get you up away from the mishkan Korach, Datan, and Aviram."
Bamidbar,16,25,And Moshe rose up and went unto Datan and Aviram; and the Ziknei Yisroel followed him.
Bamidbar,16,26,"And he spoke unto HaEdah, saying, Move back, now, from the tents of these anashim resha'im, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their chattot."
Bamidbar,16,27,"So they moved back from the mishkan Korach, Datan, and Aviram, on every side; Datan and Aviram came out, and stood in the entrance of their tents, their wives, their banim, and their little ones."
Bamidbar,16,28,"And Moshe said, Hereby ye shall know that Hashem hath sent me to do all these ma'asim; for I have not done them of mine own will."
Bamidbar,16,29,"If these men die the common death of kol haAdam, or if they be visited after the visitation of kol haAdam, then Hashem hath not sent me."
Bamidbar,16,30,"But if Hashem creates a new thing, and haadamah open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down chayyim into Sheol; then ye shall have da'as that these men have spurned Hashem."
Bamidbar,16,31,"And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these devarim, that haadamah split asunder that was under them:"
Bamidbar,16,32,"And ha'aretz opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, their batim (houses) , all the men that were of Korach, and all their possessions."
Bamidbar,16,33,"They, and all that were of them, went down chayyim into Sheol, and ha'aretz closed over them; and they perished from the midst of the Kahal."
Bamidbar,16,34,"And Kol Yisroel that were round about them fled at the cry of them, for they said, Lest ha'aretz swallow us up also."
Bamidbar,16,35,"And there came out from Hashem an eish, and consumed the 250 men that offered ketoret."
Bamidbar,16,36,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe saying,"
Bamidbar,16,37,"Speak unto El'azar ben Aharon HaKohen that he take up the fire pans out of the burning, and scatter thou the eish yonder; for they are set apart as kodesh."
Bamidbar,16,38,"The fire pans of these chatta'im against their own nefashot, let them make them hammered-out sheets for a covering of the Mizbe'ach: for they offered them before Hashem , therefore they became kadosh; and they shall be an ot unto the Bnei Yisroel."
Bamidbar,16,39,"And El'azar HaKohen took the bronze fire pans, wherewith they that were burned had offered; and they made hammered-out sheets for an overlay of the Mizbe'ach:"
Bamidbar,16,40,"To be a memorial reminder unto the Bnei Yisroel, that no zar, which is not of the zera Aharon, encroach to offer ketoret before Hashem ; that he be not as Korach, and as his edah, as Hashem said to him by the hand of Moshe."
Bamidbar,16,41,"But the next day Kol Adat Bnei Yisroel murmured against Moshe and against Aharon, saying, Ye have killed the Am Hashem."
Bamidbar,16,42,"And it came to pass, when HaEdah was gathered against Moshe and against Aharon, that they looked toward the Ohel Mo'ed; and, hinei, the Anan covered it, and the Kavod Hashem appeared."
Bamidbar,16,43,And Moshe and Aharon came before the Ohel Mo'ed.
Bamidbar,16,44,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe saying,"
Bamidbar,16,45,"Get you away from among this edah, that I may consume them as in a moment. And they fell upon their faces."
Bamidbar,16,46,"And Moshe said unto Aharon, Take a fire pan, and put eish therein from off the Mizbe'ach, and put ketoret, and go quickly unto HaEdah, and make kapporah for them; for there is Ketzef (Wrath) gone out from Hashem ; the plague is begun."
Bamidbar,16,47,"And Aharon took as Moshe commanded, and ran into the midst of the Kahal; and, hinei, the plague was begun among HaAm: and he offered ketoret, and made kapporah for HaAm."
Bamidbar,16,48,And he stood between the mesim and the chayyim; and the plague was stopped.
Bamidbar,16,49,"Now they that were the mesim in the maggefah (plague) were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, in addition to those who were mesim by reason of Korach."
Bamidbar,16,50,And Aharon returned unto Moshe unto the entrance of the Ohel Mo'ed; and the plague was stayed.
Bamidbar,17,1,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe, saying,"
Bamidbar,17,2,"Speak unto the Bnei Yisroel, and take of every one of them a rod according to the Bais Av, of all their Nasiim according to the Bais of their Avot twelve rods; write thou every man ºs shem upon his matteh (rod, staff)."
Bamidbar,17,3,And thou shalt write shem Aharon upon the rod of Levi; for one rod shall be for the Rosh of the Bais of their Avot.
Bamidbar,17,4,"And thou shalt lay them up in the Ohel Mo'ed before HaEdut, where I will meet with you there."
Bamidbar,17,5,"And it shall come to pass, that the man ºs rod, whom I shall choose, shall sprout; and I will rid Myself of the murmurings of the Bnei Yisroel, whereby they murmur against you."
Bamidbar,17,6,"And Moshe spoke unto the Bnei Yisroel, and every one of their Nasiim gave him a rod apiece, for each nasi one, according to their Bais Avot, even twelve rods; and the rod of Aharon was among their rods."
Bamidbar,17,7,And Moshe laid up the rods before Hashem in the Ohel HaEdut.
Bamidbar,17,8,"And it came to pass, that the next day Moshe entered into the Ohel HaEdut; and, hinei, the rod of Aharon for the Bais Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds."
Bamidbar,17,9,"And Moshe brought out all the rods from before Hashem unto Kol Bnei Yisroel; and they looked, and took every man his rod."
Bamidbar,17,10,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, Bring Aharon ºs rod again before HaEdut, to be kept for an ot (sign) against the rebels; and thou shalt quite put an end to their murmurings against Me, that they die not."
Bamidbar,17,11,"And Moshe did so; as Hashem commanded him, so did he."
Bamidbar,17,12,"And the Bnei Yisroel spoke unto Moshe, saying, See, we die, we perish, we will all perish."
Bamidbar,17,13,Whoever even encroaches upon the Mishkan Hashem shall die. Shall we be consumed with dying?
Bamidbar,18,1,"And Hashem said unto Aharon, Thou and thy Banim and thy Bais Av with thee shall bear the avon (guilt) of the Mikdash; and thou and thy Banim with thee shall bear the avon of the kehunah of you."
Bamidbar,18,2,"And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the Shevet Avicha, bring thou with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and minister unto thee; while thou and thy Banim with thee are before the Ohel HaEdut."
Bamidbar,18,3,"And they shall stand your guard duty, and the duty of Kol HaOhel; only they shall not come near the Klei HaKodesh and the Mizbe'ach, that neither they, nor ye also, die."
Bamidbar,18,4,"And they shall be joined unto thee, and stand guard duty of the Ohel Mo'ed, for kol Avodat HaOhel; and a zar shall not encroach unto you."
Bamidbar,18,5,"And ye shall stand guard of HaKodesh, and stand guard of the Mizbe'ach; that there be no Ketzef (Wrath) any more upon the Bnei Yisroel."
Bamidbar,18,6,"And I, hinei, I Myself have taken your brethren the Levi'im from among the Bnei Yisroel; to you they are given as a mattanah (gift) to Hashem , to do the Avodat Ohel Mo'ed."
Bamidbar,18,7,"Therefore thou and thy Banim with thee shall be shomer over your Kehunah with everything of the Mizbe'ach, and within the Parochet; and ye shall do the Avodas service: I have given your Kehunah unto you as an Avodas Mattanah; and the zar (unauthorized one) that shall encroach shall be put to death."
Bamidbar,18,8,"And Hashem spoke unto Aharon, Hinei, I also have given thee the charge of Mine terumot of kol Kodoshei Bnei Yisroel; unto thee have I given them by reason of the moshchah (kohen ºs allotted portion) , and to thy Banim, as a chok olam."
Bamidbar,18,9,"This shall be thine of the kodesh hakodashim, reserved from the eish; every korban of theirs, every minchah of theirs, and every chattat of theirs, and every asham of theirs which they shall render unto Me, shall be kodesh kodashim for thee and for thy Banim."
Bamidbar,18,10,As the kodesh hakodashim shalt thou eat it; every zachar shall eat it; it shall be kodesh unto thee.
Bamidbar,18,11,"And this is thine; the terumah of their gift, with all the tenufot Bnei Yisroel; I have given them unto thee, and to thy banim and to thy banot with thee, by a chok olam; every one that is tahor in thy Bais shall eat of it."
Bamidbar,18,12,"All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the grain, the reshit (firstfruit) of them which they shall offer unto Hashem , them have I given thee."
Bamidbar,18,13,"And whatsoever is Bikkurim in the land, which they shall bring unto Hashem , shall be thine; every one that is tahor in thine Bais shall eat of it."
Bamidbar,18,14,Every cherem in Yisroel shall be thine.
Bamidbar,18,15,"Every thing that openeth the womb in all basar, which they bring unto Hashem , whether it be of adam or behemah, shall be thine; nevertheless the bechor haadam shalt thou surely redeem, and the bechor habehemah hateme'ah shalt thou redeem."
Bamidbar,18,16,"And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thine evaluation, for the five silver shekelim, according to the shekel HaKodesh, which is twenty gerah."
Bamidbar,18,17,"But the bechor of a cow, or the bechor of a sheep, or the bechor of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are kodesh; thou shalt sprinkle their dahm upon the Mizbe'ach, and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by eish, for a re'ach nichoach unto Hashem."
Bamidbar,18,18,"And the basar of them shall be thine, like the breast of the tenufah and like the right thigh are thine."
Bamidbar,18,19,"All the terumot hakodashim, which the Bnei Yisroel offer unto Hashem , have I given thee, and thy banim and thy banot with thee, by a chok olam; it is a brit melach olam before Hashem unto thee and to thy zera with thee."
Bamidbar,18,20,"And Hashem spoke unto Aharon, Thou shalt have no nachalah in their land, neither shalt thou have any chelek among them; I am thy chelek and thine nachalah among the Bnei Yisroel."
Bamidbar,18,21,"And, hinei, I have given the Bnei Levi all the ma'aser (tithe) in Yisroel for a nachalah, for their Avodah which they serve, even the Avodat Ohel Mo'ed."
Bamidbar,18,22,"Neither must the Bnei Yisroel henceforth come near the Ohel Mo'ed, lest they bear chet, and die."
Bamidbar,18,23,"But the Levi'im shall perform the Avodat Ohel Mo'ed, lest they shall nasa (bear) their avon; it shall be a chukkat olam throughout your dorot, that among the Bnei Yisroel they have no nachalah."
Bamidbar,18,24,"But the ma'aser of the Bnei Yisroel, which they offer as a terumah unto Hashem , I have given to the Levi'im as a nachalah; therefore, I have said unto them, Among the Bnei Yisroel they shall have no nachalah."
Bamidbar,18,25,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe, saying,"
Bamidbar,18,26,"Thus speak unto the Levi'im, and say unto them, When ye take of the Bnei Yisroel the ma'aser which I have given you from them for your nachalah, then ye shall raise up a terumah of it for Hashem , even a ma'aser of the ma'aser."
Bamidbar,18,27,"And this your terumah shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the grain of the threshing floor, and as the fulness of the winepress."
Bamidbar,18,28,"Thus ye also shall offer a terumat Hashem of all your ma'aserot, which ye receive of the Bnei Yisroel; and ye shall give thereof terumat Hashem to Aharon HaKohen."
Bamidbar,18,29,"Out of all your mattenot ye shall offer every terumat Hashem , of all the best thereof, even the set apart as kodesh part thereof out of it."
Bamidbar,18,30,"Therefore, thou shalt say unto them, When ye have raised up the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levi'im as the increase of the threshing floor, and as the increase of the winepress."
Bamidbar,18,31,"And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your Bais: for it is your sachar for your Avodah in the Ohel Mo'ed."
Bamidbar,18,32,"And ye shall bear no chet by reason of it, when ye have raised up from it the best of it; neither shall ye desecrate the Kodshei Bnei Yisroel, lest ye die."
Bamidbar,19,1,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe and unto Aharon, saying,"
Bamidbar,19,2,"This is the chukkat hatorah which Hashem hath commanded, saying, Speak unto the Bnei Yisroel, that they bring thee a completely red female cow, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came ol (yoke):"
Bamidbar,19,3,"And ye shall give her unto El'azar HaKohen, that he may bring her forth outside the machaneh, and one shall slaughter (shachat) her before his face;"
Bamidbar,19,4,"And El'azar HaKohen shall take of her dahm with his finger, and sprinkle of her dahm directly before the Ohel Mo'ed seven times;"
Bamidbar,19,5,"And one shall burn the heifer in his sight; her hide, and her basar, and her dahm, with her dung, shall he burn;"
Bamidbar,19,6,"And the kohen shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and crimson thread, and cast it into the midst of the burning heifer."
Bamidbar,19,7,"Then the kohen shall wash his clothes, and he shall immerse his basar in mayim, and afterward he shall come into the machaneh, and the kohen shall be tamei until the erev."
Bamidbar,19,8,"And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in mayim, and immerse his basar in mayim, and shall be tamei until the erev."
Bamidbar,19,9,"And a man that is tahor shall gather up the ashes of the cow, and lay them up outside the machaneh in a makom tahor, and it shall be in safekeeping for HaEdah Bnei Yisroel for water of sprinkling; it is for sin-purification."
Bamidbar,19,10,"And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be tamei until the erev; and it shall be unto the Bnei Yisroel, and unto the ger that sojourneth among them, for a chukkat olam."
Bamidbar,19,11,He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be tamei shivat yamim.
Bamidbar,19,12,"He shall make himself tahor with it on the Yom HaShelishi, and on the seventh day he shall be tahor; but if he does not make himself tahor on the Yom HaShelishi, then the seventh day he shall not be tahor."
Bamidbar,19,13,"Whosoever toucheth the body of any man that is dead, and maketh not himself tahor, makes tamei the Mishkan Hashem ; and that nefesh shall be cut off from Yisroel; because the water of sprinkling was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be tamei; his tumah is yet upon him."
Bamidbar,19,14,"This is the torah, when a man dieth in an ohel, all that come into the ohel, and all that is in the ohel, shall be tamei seven days."
Bamidbar,19,15,"And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is tamei."
Bamidbar,19,16,"And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a cherev in the open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a kever, shall be tamei seven days."
Bamidbar,19,17,"And for one who is tamei they shall take of the ashes of the burning of the purification [animal], and running mayim shall be put thereto in a vessel;"
Bamidbar,19,18,"And an ish tahor shall take hyssop, and dip it in the mayim, and sprinkle it upon the ohel, and upon all the vessels, and upon the nefashot that were there, and upon him that touched a bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a kever;"
Bamidbar,19,19,"And the tahor (clean person) shall sprinkle upon the tamei on the Yom HaShelishi, and on the seventh day; and on the seventh day he shall make himself tahor, and wash his clothes, and immerse himself in mayim, and shall be tahor at erev."
Bamidbar,19,20,"But the man that shall be tamei, and shall not purify himself, that nefesh shall be cut off from among the Kahal, because he hath contaminated the Mikdash Hashem ; the water of sprinkling hath not been sprinkled upon him; he is tamei."
Bamidbar,19,21,"And it shall be a chukkat olam unto them, that he that sprinkleth the water of sprinkling shall immerse his clothes; and he that toucheth the water of sprinkling shall be tamei until erev."
Bamidbar,19,22,And whatsoever the tamei person toucheth shall be tamei; and the nefesh that toucheth it shall be tamei until erev.
Bamidbar,20,1,"Then came the Bnei Yisroel, even the kol HaEdah into the Midbar of Tzin in the first month; and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miryam died there, and was buried there."
Bamidbar,20,2,And there was no mayim for the Edah; and they gathered themselves together against Moshe and against Aharon.
Bamidbar,20,3,"And the people contended with Moshe, and spoke, saying, If only we had died when our brethren died before Hashem!"
Bamidbar,20,4,"And why have ye brought up the Kahal Hashem into this midbar, that we and our livestock should die here?"
Bamidbar,20,5,"And why have ye made us to come up out of Mitzrayim, to bring us in unto this evil place? It is no place of zera (grain) , or of te'enah (fig) , or of gefen (grapevine) , or of pomegranates; neither is there any mayim to drink."
Bamidbar,20,6,"And Moshe and Aharon went from the presence of the Kahal unto the entrance of the Ohel Mo'ed, and they fell upon their faces; and the kavod Hashem appeared unto them."
Bamidbar,20,7,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe, saying,"
Bamidbar,20,8,"Take the rod and gather thou the Edah together, thou and Aharon thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth its mayim, and thou shalt bring forth to them mayim out of the rock; so thou shalt give the Edah and their beasts drink."
Bamidbar,20,9,"And Moshe took the rod from before Hashem , just as He commanded him."
Bamidbar,20,10,"And Moshe and Aharon gathered the Kahal together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye morim (rebels, contentious ones) ; must we fetch you mayim out of this rock?"
Bamidbar,20,11,"And Moshe lifted up his hand, and with his rod he struck the rock twice; and the mayim came out abundantly, and the Edah drank, and their beasts also."
Bamidbar,20,12,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe and Aharon, Because ye believed Me not, to honor Me as kadosh in the eyes of the Bnei Yisroel, therefore ye shall not bring this Kahal into HaAretz which I have given them."
Bamidbar,20,13,"These were the Waters of Merivah (Quarreling) ; because the Bnei Yisroel quarreled with Hashem , and He showed Himself kadosh among them."
Bamidbar,20,14,"And Moshe sent messengers from Kadesh unto the melech of Edom, Thus saith thy brother Yisroel, Thou knowest all the hardship that hath befallen us:"
Bamidbar,20,15,"How Avoteinu went down into Mitzrayim, and we have dwelt in Mitzrayim a long time; and the Egyptians did evil to us, and Avoteinu;"
Bamidbar,20,16,"And when we cried unto Hashem , He heard our voice, and sent a malach, and hath brought us forth out of Mitzrayim; and, hinei, we are in Kadesh, a town in the edge of thy border;"
Bamidbar,20,17,"Let us pass, please, through thy country; we will not pass through the fields, or through the kerem (vineyards) , neither will we drink of the mayim of the wells; we will go by the Derech HaMelech; we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left until we have passed through thy territory."
Bamidbar,20,18,"And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass through me, lest I come out against thee with the cherev."
Bamidbar,20,19,"And the Bnei Yisroel said unto him, We will go by the main road; and if I and my livestock drink of thy mayim, then I will pay for it; I will only, without doing anything else, pass through on my feet."
Bamidbar,20,20,"And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out against him with a large army, and with a yad chazakah."
Bamidbar,20,21,Thus Edom refused to give Yisroel passage through his border; wherefore Yisroel turned away from him.
Bamidbar,20,22,"And the Bnei Yisroel, even Kol HaEdah, journeyed from Kadesh, and came unto Mt Hor."
Bamidbar,20,23,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe and Aharon in Mt Hor, by the border of Eretz Edom, saying,"
Bamidbar,20,24,"Aharon shall be gathered unto his people; for he shall not enter into HaAretz which I have given unto the Bnei Yisroel, because ye rebelled against My word at the Waters of Merivah."
Bamidbar,20,25,"Take Aharon and El'azar bno, and bring them up unto Mt Hor;"
Bamidbar,20,26,"And strip Aharon of his garments, and put them upon El'azar bno; and Aharon shall be gathered unto his people, and shall die there."
Bamidbar,20,27,And Moshe did as Hashem commanded; and they went up into Mt Hor in the sight of Kol HaEdah.
Bamidbar,20,28,"And Moshe stripped Aharon of his garments, and put them upon El'azar bno; and Aharon died there on the top of the mount; and Moshe and El'azar came down from the mount."
Bamidbar,20,29,"And when Kol HaEdah saw that Aharon was dead, they mourned for Aharon shloshim yom, even Kol Bais Yisroel."
Bamidbar,21,1,"And when melech of Arad the Kena'ani, which dwelt in the Negev, heard that Yisroel came by the Derech HaAtarim; then he fought against Yisroel, and took some of them prisoners."
Bamidbar,21,2,"And Yisroel vowed a neder unto Hashem , and said, If Thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities."
Bamidbar,21,3,"And Hashem paid heed to the kol Yisroel, and delivered up the Kena'ani; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities; and the place was named Chormah (Utter Destruction)."
Bamidbar,21,4,"And they journeyed from Mt Hor by the way of the Yam Suf, to go around Eretz Edom; and the nefesh haAm was much impatient because of the way."
Bamidbar,21,5,"And the people spoke against Elohim, and against Moshe, Why have ye brought us up out of Mitzrayim to die in the midbar? For there is no lechem, neither is there any mayim; and our nefesh loatheth this wretched lechem."
Bamidbar,21,6,"And Hashem sent fiery nechashim among the people, and they bit the people; and Am rav miYisroel died."
Bamidbar,21,7,"Therefore HaAm came to Moshe, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against Hashem , and against thee; pray unto Hashem that He take away the Nachash from us. And Moshe davened for the people."
Bamidbar,21,8,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, Make thee a fiery serpent, set it upon a pole; and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live."
Bamidbar,21,9,"And Moshe made a nachash of nechoshet, put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a nachash had bitten any man, when he beheld the nachash hanechoshet, then he lived."
Bamidbar,21,10,"And the Bnei Yisroel set out, and encamped in Ovot."
Bamidbar,21,11,"And they journeyed from Ovot, and encamped at Iyei-HaAvarim, in the midbar which is before Moav, toward the mizrach hashemesh."
Bamidbar,21,12,"From thence they removed, and encamped in the Wadi Zered."
Bamidbar,21,13,"From thence they removed, and encamped on the other side of Arnon, which is in the midbar encroaching the Emori; for Arnon is the border of Moav, between Moav and the Emori."
Bamidbar,21,14,"Wherefore it is said in the Sefer Milchamot Hashem , Vahev b'Sufah and in the Vadis Arnon,"
Bamidbar,21,15,"And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the site of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moav."
Bamidbar,21,16,"And from thence they went to Be'er; that is the Well whereof Hashem spoke unto Moshe, Gather the people together, and I will give them mayim."
Bamidbar,21,17,"Then Yisroel sang this shirah (song) , Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it."
Bamidbar,21,18,"The sarim (princes) dug the well, the nobles of the people dug it, by the direction of the Mechokek (Lawgiver) , with their rods. And from the midbar they went to Mattanah;"
Bamidbar,21,19,And from Mattanah to Nachaliel; and from Nachaliel to Bamot;
Bamidbar,21,20,"And from Bamot in the valley, that is in the country of Moav, to the top of Pisgah, overlooking the surface of the wasteland."
Bamidbar,21,21,"And Yisroel sent messengers unto Sichon Melech HaEmori, saying,"
Bamidbar,21,22,"Let me pass through thy land; we will not turn into the fields, or into the kerem (vineyards) ; we will not drink of the waters of the well, but we will go along by the Derech HaMelech until we be past thy borders."
Bamidbar,21,23,"And Sichon would not suffer Yisroel to pass through his border; but Sichon gathered all his army together, and went out against Yisroel into the midbar; and he came to Yahatz and fought against Yisroel."
Bamidbar,21,24,"And Yisroel struck down him with the edge of the cherev, and possessed his land from Arnon unto Yabbok, even unto the Bnei Ammon; for the border of the Bnei Ammon was fortified."
Bamidbar,21,25,"And Yisroel took all these cities; Yisroel dwelt in all the cities of the Emori, in Cheshbon, and in all the villages thereof."
Bamidbar,21,26,"For Cheshbon was the city of Sichon Melech HaEmori, who had fought against the former king of Moav, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon."
Bamidbar,21,27,"Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Cheshbon, let the city of Sichon be built and prepared;"
Bamidbar,21,28,"For there is a fire gone out of Cheshbon, a flame from the city of Sichon; it hath consumed Ar of Moav, and citizens of the heights of Arnon."
Bamidbar,21,29,"Woe to thee, Moav! Thou art undone, O people of Kemosh; he hath given his banim as fugitives, and his banot, captives unto Sichon Melech Emori."
Bamidbar,21,30,"Down they have been cast; Cheshbon is perished even unto Divon, and we have laid them waste even unto Nophach, which reacheth unto Medeva."
Bamidbar,21,31,Thus Yisroel dwelt in Eretz HaEmori.
Bamidbar,21,32,"And Moshe sent to spy out Yazer, and they took the villages thereof, and drove out HaEmori that were there."
Bamidbar,21,33,"And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan; and Og Melech HaBashan went out against them, he, and all his army, to the battle at Edre'i."
Bamidbar,21,34,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, all his army, his land; thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sichon Melech HaEmori, which dwelt at Cheshbon."
Bamidbar,21,35,"So they struck him down, and his banim, and all his army, until there was none alive left to him: and they possessed his land."
Bamidbar,22,1,"And the Bnei Yisroel set forward, and encamped in the plains of Moav on the bank of the Yarden by Yericho."
Bamidbar,22,2,And Balak ben Tzippor saw all that Yisroel had done to the Emori.
Bamidbar,22,3,"And Moav was exceedingly afraid of the people, because they were many; and Moav was filled with dread because of the Bnei Yisroel."
Bamidbar,22,4,"And Moav said unto the Ziknei Midyan, Now shall this kahal lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the sadeh. And Balak ben Tzippor was Melech of Moav at that time."
Bamidbar,22,5,"He sent malachim (messengers) therefore unto Balaam ben Be'or to Petor, which is by the River in his native land, to summon him, saying, Hinei, there is a people come out from Mitzrayim; hinei, they cover the face of ha'aretz, and they are settling next to me;"
Bamidbar,22,6,"Come now, therefore, please, curse for me this people; for they are too mighty for me; perhaps I shall prevail, that we may strike them, and that I may drive them out of ha'aretz; for I know that he whom thou blessest is m'vorach (blessed) , and he whom thou cursest is cursed."
Bamidbar,22,7,"And the Ziknei Moav and the Ziknei Midyan departed with the divination remuneration in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spoke unto him the words of Balak."
Bamidbar,22,8,"And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as Hashem shall speak unto me; and the sarim of Moav abode with Balaam."
Bamidbar,22,9,"And Elohim came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee?"
Bamidbar,22,10,"And Balaam said unto HaElohim, Balak ben Tzippor, Melech Moav, hath sent unto me, saying,"
Bamidbar,22,11,"Hinei, there is a people come out of Mitzrayim, which covereth the face of ha'aretz; come now, curse for me them; perhaps I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out."
Bamidbar,22,12,"And Elohim said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people; for baruch hu (it [the people] is blessed)."
Bamidbar,22,13,"And Balaam rose up in the boker, and said unto the sarim of Balak, Go back to your land; for Hashem refuseth to give me permission to go with you."
Bamidbar,22,14,"And the sarim of Moav rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us."
Bamidbar,22,15,"And Balak sent yet again sarim, more, and more distinguished than they."
Bamidbar,22,16,"And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak ben Tzippor, Let nothing, please, hinder thee from coming unto me;"
Bamidbar,22,17,"For I will exceedingly reward thee, and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me; come, therefore, please, curse for me this people."
Bamidbar,22,18,"And Balaam answered and said unto the avadei Balak, If Balak would give me his palace full of kesef and zahav, I cannot go beyond the Devar Hashem Elohai, to do ketanah or gedolah."
Bamidbar,22,19,"Now, therefore, please, tarry ye also here this night, that I may have da'as of what more Hashem will say unto me."
Bamidbar,22,20,"And it was lailah when Elohim came unto Balaam, and said unto him, Since the men come to summon thee, rise up and go with them; but only the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do."
Bamidbar,22,21,"And Balaam rose up in the boker, and saddled his donkey, and went with the sarim (princes) of Moav."
Bamidbar,22,22,"But the Af Elohim (G-d ºs anger) was kindled as he was going; and the Malach Hashem stood in the derech (road) l'satan (for an adversary, opposer) against him. Now he was riding upon his donkey, and his two servants were with him."
Bamidbar,22,23,"And the donkey saw the Malach Hashem standing in the derech, and his cherev drawn in his hand; and the donkey turned off the derech, and went into the sadeh; and Balaam beat the donkey, to turn her back onto the derech."
Bamidbar,22,24,"But the Malach Hashem stood in the closed-in path among the kramim (vineyards) , a wall being on this side, a wall on that side."
Bamidbar,22,25,"And when the donkey saw the Malach Hashem , she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam ºs regel against the wall; and he beat her again."
Bamidbar,22,26,"And the Malach Hashem went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no derech to turn either to the right or to the left."
Bamidbar,22,27,"And when the donkey saw the Malach Hashem , she lay down under Balaam; and af Balaam was kindled, and he beat the donkey with his staff."
Bamidbar,22,28,"And Hashem opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast beaten me these shalosh regalim (three times)?"
Bamidbar,22,29,"And Balaam answered the donkey, Because thou hast mocked me; If only there were a cherev in mine hand, would I have killed thee."
Bamidbar,22,30,"And the donkey said unto Balaam, Am not I thine donkey, upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? Was I ever accustomed to do so unto thee? And he said, Loh."
Bamidbar,22,31,"Then Hashem opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the Malach Hashem standing in the derech, and his cherev drawn in his hand; and he bowed down his head, and fell facedown."
Bamidbar,22,32,"And the Malach Hashem said unto him, Why hast thou beaten thine donkey these shalosh regalim? Hinei, I came l'satan (as adversary, opposer) to thee, because thy derech is perverse before me;"
Bamidbar,22,33,"And the donkey saw me, and turned from me these shalosh regalim; had she not turned from me, surely now also I would have slain thee, and saved her alive."
Bamidbar,22,34,"And Balaam said unto the Malach Hashem , Chatati (I have sinned) ; for I was without da'as that thou stoodest in the derech against me; now, therefore, if it displease thee, I will return home."
Bamidbar,22,35,"And the Malach Hashem said unto Balaam, Go with the anashim; but only the devar (message) that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the sarim (princes) of Balak."
Bamidbar,22,36,"And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto the city of Moav at the Arnon border, which is in the farthest point of the boundary."
Bamidbar,22,37,"And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to summon thee? Why camest thou not unto me? Am I not able indeed to honor thee?"
Bamidbar,22,38,"And Balaam said unto Balak, Hinei, I am come unto thee; have I now any power at all to say anything? The devar (word, message) which Elohim putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak."
Bamidbar,22,39,"And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kiryat Chutzot."
Bamidbar,22,40,"And Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the sarim that were with him."
Bamidbar,22,41,"And it came to pass on the next day, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up on the high places of Ba'al, that thence he might see a portion of HaAm."
Bamidbar,23,1,"And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here shivah mizbechot, and prepare for me here shivah bulls and shivah rams."
Bamidbar,23,2,And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on each mizbe'ach a bull and a ram.
Bamidbar,23,3,"And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy olah, and I will go; perhaps Hashem will come to meet me; and whatsoever He showeth me I will tell thee. And he went to a barren height."
Bamidbar,23,4,"And Elohim met Balaam, and he said unto Him, I have prepared shivah hamizbechot, and I have offered upon each mizbe'ach a bull and a ram."
Bamidbar,23,5,"And Hashem put a word in Balaam ºs mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak."
Bamidbar,23,6,"And he returned unto him, and, hinei, he stood by his olah, he, and all the sarim of Moav."
Bamidbar,23,7,"And he took up his mashal, and said, Balak Melech Moav hath brought me from Aram (Syria) , out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come, curse for me Ya'akov, and come, denounce Yisroel."
Bamidbar,23,8,"How shall I curse, whom El hath not cursed? Or how shall I denounce, whom Hashem hath not denounced?"
Bamidbar,23,9,"For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the heights I behold him; see, the people shall live apart, and shall not be reckoned among the Goyim."
Bamidbar,23,10,"Who can count the dust of Ya'akov, and the number of the fourth part of Yisroel? Let my nefesh die the death of the yesharim (righteous ones) , and let my latter end be like his!"
Bamidbar,23,11,"And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I brought thee to curse mine enemies, and, hinei, thou hast altogether put a brocha on them."
Bamidbar,23,12,"And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which Hashem hath put in my mouth?"
Bamidbar,23,13,"And Balak said unto him, Come with me unto another place, from where thou mayest see them; thou shalt see part but not all of them, and curse them for me from there."
Bamidbar,23,14,"And he brought him into the sadeh of Tzophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built shivah mizbechot, and offered a bull and a ram on each mizbe'ach."
Bamidbar,23,15,"And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy olah, while I meet Hashem over there."
Bamidbar,23,16,"And Hashem met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Go again unto Balak, and say thus."
Bamidbar,23,17,"And when he came to him, hinei, he stood by his olah, and the sarim of Moav with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath Hashem spoken?"
Bamidbar,23,18,"And he took up his mashal, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; pay heed unto me, thou son of Tzippor."
Bamidbar,23,19,"El is not an ish, that He should lie; neither a ben adam, that He should change His mind; hath He said, and shall He not do it? Or hath He spoken, and shall He not carry it out?"
Bamidbar,23,20,"Hinei, I have received commandment to make brocha; and He hath blessed; and I cannot reverse it."
Bamidbar,23,21,"He hath not beheld aven in Ya'akov, neither hath He seen amal (trouble) in Yisroel. Hashem Elohav is with him, and the [jubilant] shout of a melech is about him."
Bamidbar,23,22,El brought them out of Mitzrayim; He is for them like the strength of a wild ox.
Bamidbar,23,23,Surely there is no nachash (augury) in Ya'akov; neither is there any kesem (divination) in Yisroel; at the time it is spoken to Ya'akov and to Yisroel what El doeth!
Bamidbar,23,24,"See, the people shall rise up as a lioness, and lift up himself as an ari; he shall not lie down until he devours the prey, and drinks the dahm of the slain."
Bamidbar,23,25,"And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor at all make a brocha on them."
Bamidbar,23,26,"But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Did I not tell thee, saying, All that Hashem speaketh, that I must do?"
Bamidbar,23,27,"And Balak said unto Balaam, Come now, I will bring thee unto another place; perhaps it will please HaElohim that thou mayest curse them for me from there."
Bamidbar,23,28,"And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Pe'or, that overlooks Yeshimon."
Bamidbar,23,29,"And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here shivah mizbechot, and prepare here shivah bulls and shivah rams for me."
Bamidbar,23,30,"And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on each mizbe'ach."
Bamidbar,24,1,"And when Balaam saw that it was tov in the eyes of Hashem to bless Yisroel, he went not, as at other times, to use nechashim (sorceries, divination, looking for omens) but he set his face toward hamidbar."
Bamidbar,24,2,"And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Yisroel encamped according to their Shevatim; and the Ruach Elohim came upon him."
Bamidbar,24,3,"And he took up his mashal, and said, Balaam ben Be'or hath said, the man whose eyes are open hath said,"
Bamidbar,24,4,"He hath said which heard the words of El, which saw the machazeh Shaddai (vision of Shaddai) , which falling prostrate, but having his eyes open:"
Bamidbar,24,5,"Mah tovu ohalecha (How goodly, beautiful, are thy tents) , O Ya'akov, and mishkenotecha (thy dwellings, tabernacles) , O Yisroel!"
Bamidbar,24,6,"As the valleys are they spread forth, as ganot (gardens) by the riverside, like aloes which Hashem hath planted, and as cedar trees beside the mayim."
Bamidbar,24,7,"He shall pour the mayim out of his buckets, and his zera shall have mayim rabbim, and his Melech shall be more exalted than Agag, and Malchuso (His Kingdom) shall be upraised."
Bamidbar,24,8,"El brought him forth out of Mitzrayim. He hath the strength of a wild bull. He shall devour the Goyim his enemies and break their atzmot, and pierce them through with his khitzim."
Bamidbar,24,9,"He crouched, he lay down as an ari, and as the lioness; who shall stir him up? Mevarakhecha is he that makes a barucha on thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee."
Bamidbar,24,10,"And af Balak (anger of Balak) was kindled against Balaam, and he struck his hands together; and Balak said unto Balaam, I summoned thee to curse mine enemies, and, hinei, thou hast altogether blessed them these shalosh pe'amim."
Bamidbar,24,11,"Therefore now flee thou to thy mekom; I thought to kibed (honor, reward) thee honorably; but, hinei, Hashem hath kept thee back from kavod (honor, reward)."
Bamidbar,24,12,"And Balaam said unto Balak, Spoke I not also to thy malachim which thou didst send unto me, saying,"
Bamidbar,24,13,"If Balak would give me his bais full of kesef and zahav, I cannot go beyond the commandment of Hashem , to do either tovah or ra'ah of mine own lev; but what Hashem saith, that will I say!"
Bamidbar,24,14,"And now, hinei, I go back unto my people; come therefore, and I will warn thee what HaAm HaZeh shall do to thy people in the Acharit HaYamim."
Bamidbar,24,15,"And he took up his mashal, and said, Balaam ben Be'or hath said, the man whose eyes are open hath said,"
Bamidbar,24,16,"He hath said, which heard the words of El, and knew the Da'as Elyon, which saw the Machazeh Shaddai, falling prostrate, but having his eyes open:"
Bamidbar,24,17,"I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not karov (near) ; there shall come a Kokhav (Star, i.e. Moshiach, see Targums) out of Ya'akov, and a Shevet (Sceptre) shall rise out of Yisroel, and shall strike through the temples of Moav, and destroy all the Bnei Shet."
Bamidbar,24,18,And Edom shall be a possession; Se'ir also shall be a possession for his enemies; but Yisroel shall do valiantly.
Bamidbar,24,19,"Out of Ya'akov shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that remaineth of the Ir."
Bamidbar,24,20,"And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his mashal, and said, Amalek was the reshit of the Goyim; but his acharit (latter end) shall be that unto destruction."
Bamidbar,24,21,"And he looked on the Keni (Kenites) , and took up his mashal, and said, Strong is thy moshav (dwelling place) , and thou puttest thy ken (nest) in a rock."
Bamidbar,24,22,"Nevertheless Kayin shall be for burning, while Ashur (Assyria) shall carry thee away captive."
Bamidbar,24,23,"And he took up his mashal, and said, Oy, who shall live when El doeth this?"
Bamidbar,24,24,"And ships shall come from the coast of Kittim (Cyprus) , and shall afflict Ashur (Assyria) , and shall afflict Ever, and he also shall be unto destruction."
Bamidbar,24,25,"And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his makom (place, home) ; and Balak also went his way."
Bamidbar,25,1,"And Yisroel was staying in Sheetim, and HaAm began to commit whoredom with the Banot Moav."
Bamidbar,25,2,And they invited the people unto the zevakhim of their g-ds; and the people did eat and bowed down to their g-ds.
Bamidbar,25,3,And Yisroel joined himself unto Ba'al-Pe'or; and the Af Hashem was kindled against Yisroel.
Bamidbar,25,4,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, Take Kol Rashei HaAm, and kill them, hanging them before Hashem against the shemesh, that the fierce Af Hashem (Anger of Hashem) may be turned away from Yisroel."
Bamidbar,25,5,"And Moshe said unto the shofetim of Yisroel, Slay ye every one his men that were joined unto Ba'al-Pe'or."
Bamidbar,25,6,"And, hinei, one of the Bnei Yisroel came and brought unto his brethren a woman from Midyan before the eyes of Moshe, and before the eyes of Kol Adat Bnei Yisroel, who were weeping before the entrance of the Ohel Mo'ed."
Bamidbar,25,7,"And when Pinchas ben El'azar ben Aharon HaKohen saw it, he rose up from among HaEdah, and took a romach (spear) in his yad;"
Bamidbar,25,8,"And he went after the ish Yisroel into the inner tent, and thrust through both of them, the ish Yisroel, and the isha through her belly. So the maggefah (plague) was stopped from the Bnei Yisroel."
Bamidbar,25,9,And those that were the mesim (dead ones) in the maggefah (plague) were twenty and four thousand.
Bamidbar,25,10,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe, saying,"
Bamidbar,25,11,"Pinchas ben El'azar ben Aharon HaKohen, hath turned My wrath away from the Bnei Yisroel, when he had kanous (zealousness) with My kanous among them, that I consumed not the Bnei Yisroel in My kina (jealousy, zeal, vengeance)."
Bamidbar,25,12,"Therefore say, Hineni, I am making unto him My Brit (Covenant) of Shalom;"
Bamidbar,25,13,"And he shall have it, and his zera after him, even the Brit Kehunat Olam; because he had kanous for Elohav, and made kapporah for the Bnei Yisroel."
Bamidbar,25,14,"Now the shem of the ish Yisroel that was slain, even that was slain with the woman from Midyan, was Zimri ben Salu, a nasi of one of the beit avot from the tribe of Shim'on."
Bamidbar,25,15,And the shem of the isha from Midyan that was slain was Kozbi bat Tzur; he was rosh over the people in one of the clans of Midyan.
Bamidbar,25,16,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe, saying,"
Bamidbar,25,17,"Be hostile toward the Midyanim, and strike them;"
Bamidbar,25,18,"For they are hostile toward you with their wiles, wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Pe'or, and in the matter of Kozbi bat Nasi Midyan, their achot, which was slain in the yom of the maggefah that resulted from Pe'or."
Bamidbar,26,1,"And it came to pass after the maggefah (plague) , that Hashem spoke unto Moshe and unto El'azar Ben Aharon HaKohen, saying,"
Bamidbar,26,2,"Take the rosh (census) of kol Adat Bnei Yisroel from twenty years old and upward, throughout their bais avot, all that are yotzei tzava (able to go to war) in Yisroel."
Bamidbar,26,3,"And Moshe and El'azar HaKohen spoke with them in the arevot Moav (plains of Moav) by Yarden near Yericho, saying,"
Bamidbar,26,4,"Take the census of the people, from twenty years old and upward, just as Hashem commanded Moshe and the Bnei Yisroel, which went forth out of Eretz Mitzrayim."
Bamidbar,26,5,"Reuven, the Bechor Yisroel: the Bnei Reuven; Chanokh, of whom cometh the Mishpakhat HaChanokhi; of Pallu, the Mishpakhat HaPallu'i;"

Bamidbar,26,10,"And ha'aretz opened her mouth, and swallowed them up together with Korach, when that edah died, when the eish devoured 250; and they became as a nes (warning)."
Bamidbar,26,11,"Notwithstanding, the Bnei Korach died not."

Bamidbar,27,6,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe, saying,"
Bamidbar,27,7,The Banot Tzelophechad speak right; thou shalt surely give them achuzzat nachalah among achei avihem; and thou shalt cause the nachalat avihen to pass over unto them.
Bamidbar,27,8,"And thou shalt speak unto the Bnei Yisroel, saying, If an ish die, and have no ben, then ye shall cause his nachalah to pass over unto his bat."
Bamidbar,27,9,"And if he have no bat, then ye shall give his nachalah unto his achim."

Bamidbar,27,12,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, Get thee up on this har haAvarim, and see HaAretz which I have given unto the Bnei Yisroel."
Bamidbar,27,13,"And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people, as Aharon achicha was gathered."
Bamidbar,27,14,"For ye rebelled against My command in the Midbar Tzin, in the merivat HaEdah (strife of the Assembly) to honor Me as Kodesh before their eyes at the mayim: that is, the mayim of Merivah in Kadesh in the Midbar Tzin."
Bamidbar,27,15,"And Moshe spoke unto Hashem , saying,"

Bamidbar,27,17,"Which will go out before them, and which will come in before them, and which will lead them out, and which will bring them in; that the Adat Hashem be not like tzon which have no ro'eh."
Bamidbar,27,18,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, Take thee Yehoshua Ben Nun, an ish in whom is the Ruach, and lay thine yad upon him;"
Bamidbar,27,19,"And stand him before El'azar HaKohen, and before kol HaEdah and give him a charge before their eyes."
Bamidbar,27,20,"And thou shalt lay of thine hod (dignity, authority, majesty) upon him, so that kol Adat Bnei Yisroel will obey."
Bamidbar,27,21,"And he shall stand before El'azar HaKohen, who shall ask counsel for him after the mishpat HaUrim before Hashem : at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and kol Bnei Yisroel with him, even kol HaEdah."
Bamidbar,27,22,"And Moshe did just as Hashem commanded him; and he took Yehoshua, and stood him before El'azar HaKohen, and before kol HaEdah:"
Bamidbar,27,23,"And he laid his yadayim upon him, and gave him a charge, just as Hashem commanded by yad Moshe."
Bamidbar,28,1,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe, saying,"
Bamidbar,28,2,"Command the Bnei Yisroel, and say unto them, My korban, and My lechem by My fires, My re'ach hannichoach, shall ye be shomer to offer unto Me in its mo'ed."
Bamidbar,28,3,"And thou shalt say unto them, This is the fire-offering which ye shall offer unto Hashem ; two kevasim (male lambs) of the first year temimim, two a day, for an olah tamid."
Bamidbar,28,4,"The one keves shalt thou offer in the boker, and the other keves shalt thou offer towards erev;"

Bamidbar,28,8,"And the other keves (male lamb) shalt thou offer at erev: like the minchah of the boker, and like the nesekh thereof, thou shalt offer it, a fire-offering of re'ach hannicho'ach unto Hashem."
Bamidbar,28,9,"And on Yom HaShabbos two kevasim of the first year temimim (unblemished ones) and two tenths-ephah of fine flour for a minchah, mixed with shemen, and the nesekh thereof;"

Bamidbar,29,39,"These things ye shall do unto Hashem in your Mo'adim, in addition to your nederim, and your nedavot, for your olat, and for your minchot, and for your nesakhim, and for your shelamim."
Bamidbar,29,40,And Moshe told the Bnei Yisroel according to all that Hashem commanded Moshe.
Bamidbar,30,1,"And Moshe spoke unto the Rashei HaMattot (Heads of the Tribes) concerning the Bnei Yisroel saying, This is the thing which Hashem hath commanded:"
Bamidbar,30,2,"If an ish vow a neder unto Hashem , or swear a shevu'ah (oath) to bind his nefesh with an issar (negative vow, prohibition) , he shall not break his devar, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth."
Bamidbar,30,3,"If an isha also vow a neder unto Hashem , and bind herself by an issar, being in her bais avi in her youth;"
Bamidbar,30,4,"And her av hear her neder, and her issar wherewith she hath bound her nefesh, and her av says nothing to her, then all her nedarim shall stand, and every issar wherewith she hath bound her nefesh shall stand."
Bamidbar,30,5,"But if her av disallow her in the yom that he heareth, not any of her nedarim, or of her issurim (negative vows, prohibitions) wherewith she hath bound her nefesh, shall stand; and Hashem shall forgive her, because her av forbade her."
Bamidbar,30,6,"And if she had at all an ish, when she made nedarim or utterance of her lips, wherewith she bound her nefesh;"
Bamidbar,30,7,"And her ish heard it, and said nothing to her in the yom that he heard it, then her nedarim shall stand, and her issurim wherewith she bound her nefesh shall stand."
Bamidbar,30,8,"But if her ish forbade her on the yom that he heard it, then he shall nullify her neder which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her nefesh; and Hashem shall forgive her."
Bamidbar,30,9,"But every neder of an almanah, and of a gerushah (divorced woman) , wherewith she have bound her nefesh, shall stand against her."
Bamidbar,30,10,"And if she vowed in her bais ish, or bound her nefesh by an issar with a shevuah,"
Bamidbar,30,11,"And her ish heard it, and said nothing to her, and forbade her not, then all her nedarim shall stand, and every issar wherewith she bound her nefesh shall stand."
Bamidbar,30,12,"But if her ish hath utterly nullified them on the yom he heard them, then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her nedarim, or concerning the issar of her nefesh, shall not stand; her ish hath nullified them; and Hashem shall forgive her."
Bamidbar,30,13,"Every neder, and every shevuat issar to afflict the nefesh, her ish may let it stand, or her ish may let it have a hafarah."
Bamidbar,30,14,"But if her ish say nothing to her from yom to yom, then he will have let stand all her nedarim or all her issurim, which are upon her; he will have let them stand, because he said nothing to her in the yom that he heard them."
Bamidbar,30,15,"But if he shall revoke them after that he hath heard them, then nasa (he shall bear) her avon."
Bamidbar,30,16,"These are the chukkim, which Hashem commanded Moshe, between an ish and his isha, between the av and his bat, being yet in her youth in her bais avi."
Bamidbar,31,1,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe, saying,"
Bamidbar,31,2,Avenge the Bnei Yisroel of the Midyanim; afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people.
Bamidbar,31,3,"And Moshe spoke unto HaAm, saying, Arm some of your anashim unto war, let them go against Midyan, and avenge Hashem of Midyan."
Bamidbar,31,4,"Of every matteh a thousand, throughout kol mattot Yisroel, shall ye send to war."
Bamidbar,31,5,"So there were supplied out of the thousands of Yisroel, an elef (a thousand) of every matteh, sheneym asar elef armed for war."
Bamidbar,31,6,"And Moshe sent them to war, a thousand of every tribe, them and Pinchas Ben El'azar HaKohen, to the war, with the kelei hakodesh, and the khatzotzerot hateru'ah in his yad."
Bamidbar,31,7,"And they warred against Midyan, just, as Hashem commanded Moshe; and they slaughtered kol zachar."
Bamidbar,31,8,"And they slaughtered the Melachim of Midyan, besides the rest of them that were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Tzur, and Chur, and Reva, five melachim of Midyan; Balaam Ben Be'or also they slaughtered with the cherev."
Bamidbar,31,9,"And the Bnei Yisroel took all the nashim of Midyan captive, and their little ones, and took the plunder of all their behemah, and all their mikneh, and all their goods."
Bamidbar,31,10,"And they burned with eish all their towns wherein were their moshavot, and all their camps."
Bamidbar,31,11,"And they took all the plunder, and all the spoil, both of adam and of behemah."
Bamidbar,31,12,"And they brought the captives, and the plunder, and the spoil, unto Moshe, and El'azar HaKohen, and unto the Adat Bnei Yisroel, unto the machaneh at the plains of Moav, which are by Yarden near Yericho."
Bamidbar,31,13,"And Moshe, and El'azar HaKohen, and all the nasiim of the Edah, went forth to meet them outside the machaneh."
Bamidbar,31,14,"And Moshe was in wrath with the pekudei hechayil (officers of the army) , with the sarim over thousands, and sarim over hundreds, which were returning from the milchamah of the army."
Bamidbar,31,15,"And Moshe said unto them, Have ye saved all the nekevah alive?"
Bamidbar,31,16,"Hinei, these caused the Bnei Yisroel, through the davar Balaam, to turn unfaithful against Hashem in the matter of Pe'or, and there was a magefah (plague) among the Adat Hashem."
Bamidbar,31,17,"Now therefore slaughter every zachar among the little ones, and kill every isha that hath known ish by lying with zachar."
Bamidbar,31,18,"But all the girl nashim, that have no da'as of lying with zachar, save alive for yourselves."
Bamidbar,31,19,"And do ye abide outside the machaneh shivat yamim; whosoever hath killed nefesh, and whosoever hath touched any chalal, purify both yourselves and your captives on Yom HaShelishi and on Yom HaShevi'i."
Bamidbar,31,20,"And purify all your beged, and all keli ohr (all that is made of leather) , ma'aseh izzim (all that is made of goat hair) and keli etz (all that is make of wood)."
Bamidbar,31,21,"And El'azar HaKohen said unto the anshei hatzavah which went into milchamah, This is the chukkat hatorah which Hashem commanded Moshe:"
Bamidbar,31,22,"Only the zahav, and the kesef, the nechoshet, the barzel, the bedil, and the oferet,"
Bamidbar,31,23,"Everything that can withstand eish, ye shall make it go through the eish, and it shall be tahor; nevertheless it shall be purified with the mayim of niddah; and all that can not withstand the eish ye shall make go through the mayim."
Bamidbar,31,24,"And ye shall wash your begadim on Yom HaShevi'i, and ye shall be tahor, and afterward ye shall come into the machaneh."
Bamidbar,31,25,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe, saying,"
Bamidbar,31,26,"Take inventory of the spoil that was taken, both of adam and of behemah, thou, and El'azar HaKohen, and the Rashei Avot HaEdah:"
Bamidbar,31,27,"And divide the spoil into two parts: between them that took the milchamah upon them, who went out to battle, and kol HaEdah;"
Bamidbar,31,28,"And levy a mekhes (tribute) unto Hashem of the anshei hamilchamah which went out to battle: one nefesh from five hundred, both of adam, and of bakar, and of chamorim, and of tzon;"
Bamidbar,31,29,"Take it of their half, and give it unto El'azar HaKohen, for a terumat Hashem."
Bamidbar,31,30,"And of the Bnei Yisroel ºs half, thou shalt take one portion of fifty, of adam, of bakar, of chamorim, and of tzon, of all behemah, and give them unto the Levi'im, who are shomrei mishmeret Mishkan Hashem (who are guardians of the Mishkan Hashem)."
Bamidbar,31,31,And Moshe and El'azar HaKohen did just as Hashem commanded Moshe.
Bamidbar,31,32,"And the spoil, being the rest of the plunder which the am hatzava (personnel of the army) had taken, was 675,000 tzon,"
Bamidbar,31,33,"And 72,000 bakar,"
Bamidbar,31,34,"And 61,000 chamorim,"
Bamidbar,31,35,"And 32,000 nefesh adam from the nashim who had no da'as of zachar by lying with him."
Bamidbar,31,36,"And the half, which was the chelek of them that went out to war, was in number 337,500 tzon;"
Bamidbar,31,37,And the mekhes (tribute) for Hashem of the tzon was 675.
Bamidbar,31,38,"And the bakar were 36,000; of which the mekhes for Hashem was 72."
Bamidbar,31,39,"And the chamorim were 30,500; of which the mekhes for Hashem was 61."
Bamidbar,31,40,"And the nefesh adam were 16,000; of which the mekhes for Hashem was 32 nefesh."
Bamidbar,31,41,"And Moshe gave the mekhes, which was the terumat Hashem , unto El'azar HaKohen, as Hashem commanded Moshe."
Bamidbar,31,42,"And of the Bnei Yisroel ºs half, which Moshe divided from the anashim hatzove'im,"
Bamidbar,31,43,"(Now the half that pertained unto the Edah was 337,500 tzon,"
Bamidbar,31,44,"And 36,000 bakar,"
Bamidbar,31,45,"And thirty thousand chamorim and five hundred,"
Bamidbar,31,46,And sixteen thousand nefesh adam);
Bamidbar,31,47,"Even of the Bnei Yisroel ºs half, Moshe took one portion of fifty, both of adam and of behemah, and gave them unto the Levi'im, who were shomrei mishmeret Mishkan Hashem ; just as Hashem commanded Moshe."
Bamidbar,31,48,"And the pekudim (officers) which were over thousands of the tzava (army) , the sarim of thousands, and sarim of hundreds, came near unto Moshe;"
Bamidbar,31,49,"And they said unto Moshe, Thy avadim have taken the muster census of the anshei hamilchamah which are under our charge, and there was missing not one ish of us."
Bamidbar,31,50,"We have therefore brought a korban Hashem , what every ish hath gotten, of articles of zahav, armlets, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and necklaces, to make kapporah for our nefashot before Hashem."
Bamidbar,31,51,"And Moshe and El'azar HaKohen took the zahav of them, even all wrought jewels."
Bamidbar,31,52,"And all the zahav of the terumah (offering) that they offered up to Hashem , of the sarim of thousands, and of the sarim of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels."
Bamidbar,31,53," (For the anshei hatzava had taken plunder, every ish for himself.)"
Bamidbar,31,54,"And Moshe and El'azar HaKohen accepted the zahav of the sarim of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the Ohel Mo'ed, for a zikaron (memorial) for the Bnei Yisroel before Hashem."
Bamidbar,32,1,"Now the Bnei Reuven and the Bnei Gad had a very great multitude of mikneh; and when they saw Eretz Yazer, and Eretz Gil'ad, that, hinei, the makom was a makom for mikneh;"
Bamidbar,32,2,"The Bnei Gad and the Bnei Reuven came and spoke unto Moshe, and to El'azar HaKohen, and unto the nasiim of the Edah, saying,"
Bamidbar,32,3,"Atarot, and Divon, and Yazer, and Nimrah, and Cheshbon, and Elealeh, and Sevam, and Nevo, and Be'on,"
Bamidbar,32,4,"Even HaAretz which Hashem struck to conquer before the Adat Yisroel, is an eretz for mikneh, and thy avadim have mikneh."
Bamidbar,32,5,"They said, If we have found chen in thy sight, let this land be given unto thy avadim for an achuzzah, and bring us not over Yarden."
Bamidbar,32,6,"And Moshe said unto the Bnei Gad and to the Bnei Reuven, Shall your achim go to milchamah while ye sit here?"
Bamidbar,32,7,And why discourage ye the lev Bnei Yisroel from going over into HaAretz which Hashem hath given them?
Bamidbar,32,8,"Thus did Avoteichem, when I sent them from Kadesh-Barnea to look over HaAretz."
Bamidbar,32,9,"For when they went up unto the Eshcol Valley, and saw HaAretz, they discouraged the lev Bnei Yisroel, that they should not go into HaAretz which Hashem had given them."
Bamidbar,32,10,"And the Af Hashem was kindled on that day, and He swore, saying,"
Bamidbar,32,11,"Surely none of the anashim that came up out of Mitzrayim, from twenty years old and upward, shall see HaAdamah which I swore unto Avraham, unto Yitzchak, and unto Ya'akov; because they have not fully followed Me;"
Bamidbar,32,12,"Except Kalev Ben Yephunneh the Kenizi, and Yehoshua Ben Nun; for they have fully followed after Hashem."
Bamidbar,32,13,"And the Af Hashem was kindled against Yisroel, and He made them wander in the midbar arba'im shanah, until kol hador that had done harah in the sight of Hashem , were consumed."
Bamidbar,32,14,"And, hinei, ye are risen up in the place of Avoteichem a brood of anashim chatta'im to add even more to charon af Hashem against Yisroel."
Bamidbar,32,15,"For if ye turn away from after Him, He will yet again leave them in the midbar; and ye shall destroy kol HaAm Hazeh."
Bamidbar,32,16,"And they came near unto him, and said, We will build gidrot tzon here for our mikneh, and towns for our little ones;"
Bamidbar,32,17,"But we ourselves will go ready armed ahead of the Bnei Yisroel, until we have brought them unto their makom; and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of HaAretz."
Bamidbar,32,18,"We will not return unto bateinu, until the Bnei Yisroel have inherited every ish his nachalah."
Bamidbar,32,19,"For we will not inherit with them across the Yarden, or beyond; because our nachalah is fallen to us on this side of the Yarden eastward."
Bamidbar,32,20,"And Moshe said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will go armed before Hashem to milchamah,"
Bamidbar,32,21,"And will go all of you armed over Yarden before Hashem , until He hath driven out His oyevim from before Him,"
Bamidbar,32,22,"And HaAretz be subdued before Hashem ; then afterward ye shall return, and be nekiyim before Hashem , and before Yisroel; and HaAretz Hazot shall be your achuzzah before Hashem."
Bamidbar,32,23,"But if ye will not do so, hinei, ye have sinned against Hashem and be sure chattatechem (your sin) will find you out."
Bamidbar,32,24,"Build you towns for your little ones, and your gidrot tzon; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth."
Bamidbar,32,25,"And the Bnei Gad and the Bnei Reuven spoke unto Moshe saying, Thy avadim will do as adoni commandeth."
Bamidbar,32,26,"Our little ones, our nashim, our mikneh, and all behemeteinu, shall stay there in the cities of Gil'ad;"
Bamidbar,32,27,"But thy avadim will cross over, every man armed for war, before Hashem to battle, as adoni saith."
Bamidbar,32,28,"So concerning them Moshe commanded El'azar HaKohen, and Yehoshua Ben Nun, and the Rashei Avot HaMattot of the Bnei Yisroel;"
Bamidbar,32,29,"And Moshe said unto them, If the Bnei Gad and the Bnei Reuven will cross with you over Yarden, every man armed for battle, before Hashem , and HaAretz shall be subdued before you, then ye shall give them Eretz Gil'ad for an achuzzah;"
Bamidbar,32,30,"But if they will not cross over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in Eretz Kena'an."
Bamidbar,32,31,"And the Bnei Gad and the Bnei Reuven answered, saying, As Hashem hath said unto thy avadim, so will we do."
Bamidbar,32,32,"We will cross over armed before Hashem into Eretz Kena'an, that the achuzzat nachalateinu on that side of the Yarden may be our own."
Bamidbar,32,33,"And Moshe gave unto them, even to the Bnei Gad, and to the Bnei Reuven, and unto half the shevet of Menasheh Ben Yosef, the kingdom of Sichon Melech HaEmori, and the kingdom of Og Melech HaBashan, the land, with the cities thereof in the territories, even the cities of the surrounding land."
Bamidbar,32,34,"And the Bnei Gad built Divon, and Atarot, and Aro'er,"
Bamidbar,32,35,"And Atrot Shophan, Yazer, and Yogbehah,"
Bamidbar,32,36,"And Beit-Nimrah and Beit-Haran, fortified cities; and gidrot tzon."
Bamidbar,32,37,"And the Bnei Reuven built Cheshbon, and Elealeh, and Kiryatayim,"
Bamidbar,32,38,"And Nevo, and Ba'al-Me'on, (their shem being changed) and Sivmah; and gave other shmot unto the cities which they built."
Bamidbar,32,39,"And the Bnei Machir Ben Menasheh went to Gil'ad, and captured it, and dispossessed the Emori (Amorite) which was in it."
Bamidbar,32,40,And Moshe gave Gil'ad unto Machir Ben Menasheh; and he dwelt therein.
Bamidbar,32,41,"And Yair Ben Menasheh went and captured the settlements thereof, and called them Chavot Ya'ir."
Bamidbar,32,42,"And Novach went and captured Kenat, and the villages thereof, and called it Novach, after shmo."
Bamidbar,33,1,"These are the journeys of the Bnei Yisroel, which went forth out of Eretz Mitzrayim by their tzveos under yad Moshe and Aharon."
Bamidbar,33,2,And Moshe recorded their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of Hashem ; and these are their journeys according to their goings forth.
Bamidbar,33,3,"And they departed from Ra'meses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the day after the Pesach the Bnei Yisroel went out with a yad ramah (upraised hand, i.e., confidently) l'einei kol Mitzrayim."
Bamidbar,33,4,"For the Mitzrayim buried all their bechor, which Hashem had struck down among them; upon their elohim also Hashem executed shefatim (judgments)."
Bamidbar,33,5,"And the Bnei Yisroel set out from Ra'meses, and encamped in Sukkot."
Bamidbar,33,6,"And they set out from Sukkot, and encamped in Etam, which is on the edge of the midbar."
Bamidbar,33,7,"And they set out from Etam, and turned back unto Pi-HaChirot, which is before Ba'al-Tzephon; and they encamped before Migdol."
Bamidbar,33,8,"And they set out from before HaChirot, and passed through the midst of the yam into the midbar, and went derech shloshet yamim (a three days º journey) in the midbar of Etam, and encamped in Marah."
Bamidbar,33,9,"And they set out from Marah, and came unto Elim; and in Elim were twelve einot mayim (springs of water) , and threescore and ten temarim (palm trees) ; and they encamped there."

Bamidbar,33,43,"And they set out from Punon, and encamped in Ovot."
Bamidbar,33,44,"And they set out from Ovot, and encamped in Iyei-HaAvarim at border of Moav."
Bamidbar,33,45,"And they set out from Iyim, and encamped in Divon Gad."
Bamidbar,33,46,"And they set out from Divon Gad, and encamped in Almon Divlatayim."
Bamidbar,33,47,"And they set out from Almon Divlatayim, and encamped in the mountains of Avarim, before Nevo."
Bamidbar,33,48,"And they set out from the mountains of Avarim, and encamped in the plains of Moav by Yarden near Yericho."
Bamidbar,33,49,"And they set out by Yarden, from Beit-HaYeshimot even unto Avel-Sheetim in the plains of Moav."
Bamidbar,33,50,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe in the plains of Moav by Yarden near Yericho, saying,"
Bamidbar,33,51,"Speak unto the Bnei Yisroel, and say unto them, When ye are crossing over Yarden into Eretz Kena'an,"
Bamidbar,33,52,"Then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of HaAretz from before you, and destroy all their maskiyyot (stone carved statues) , and destroy all their tzalmei massekhot and demolish all their [idolatrous] high places;"
Bamidbar,33,53,"And ye shall take possession of HaAretz, and dwell therein; for I have given you HaAretz to possess it."
Bamidbar,33,54,"And ye shall distribute HaAretz by goral for an inheritance among your mishpekhot; and to the more numerous ye shall give the larger nachalah, and to the fewer in number ye shall give the smaller nachalah; every man ºs nachalah shall be in the place where his goral falleth; according to the mattot (tribes of) Avoteichem ye shall inherit."
Bamidbar,33,55,"But if ye will not drive out the yoshvei HaAretz from before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain of them shall be barbs in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall harass you in HaAretz wherein ye dwell."
Bamidbar,33,56,"Moreover it shall come to pass, that I shall do unto you, as I meant to do unto them."
Bamidbar,34,1,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe, saying,"
Bamidbar,34,2,"Command the Bnei Yisroel, and say unto them, When ye come into Eretz Kena'an (this is HaAretz that shall fall unto you for a nachalah, even Eretz Kena'an with the borders thereof),"
Bamidbar,34,3,"Then your southern side shall be from the Midbar Tzin along by the border of Edom, and your southern border shall be from the edge of the Yam HaMelach (Salt Sea, Dead Sea) to the east;"
Bamidbar,34,4,"And your border shall turn from the south of Ma'aleh Akrabbim, and pass on to Tzin; and the going forth thereof shall be from the south of Kadesh-Barnea, and shall go on to Chatzar Addar, and pass on to Atzmon;"
Bamidbar,34,5,"And the border shall go around from Atzmon unto the Wadi of Mitzrayim, and the goings out of it shall be toward the Sea."
Bamidbar,34,6,"And as for the western border, ye shall even have the Yam HaGadol for a border; this shall be your west border."
Bamidbar,34,7,And this shall be your northern border: from the Yam HaGadol ye shall run to Mt Hor;
Bamidbar,34,8,From Mt Hor ye shall run your border unto the approach to Chamat; and the goings forth of the border shall be toward Tzedad;
Bamidbar,34,9,"And the border shall go on to Ziphron, and the goings out of it shall be Chatzar Einan; this shall be your northern border."
Bamidbar,34,10,And ye shall draw a line for you for an eastern border from Chatzar Einan to Shepham;
Bamidbar,34,11,"And the border shall go down from Shepham to Rivlah, on the east side of Ayin; the border shall descend, and shall reach unto the bank of the Yam Kinneret to the east;"
Bamidbar,34,12,"And the border shall go down to the Yarden, and the goings out of it shall be at the Yam HaMelach; this shall be your land with the borders thereof all around."
Bamidbar,34,13,"And Moshe commanded the Bnei Yisroel, saying, This is the land which ye shall inherit by goral, which Hashem commanded to give unto the nine mattot (tribes) , and to the half tribe;"
Bamidbar,34,14,"For the tribe of the Bnei Reuven according to the bais avotam, and the tribe of the Bnei Gad according to the bais avotam and the half tribe of Menasheh have received their nachalah;"
Bamidbar,34,15,The two tribes and the half tribe have received their nachalah on the east side of the Yarden near Yericho toward the sunrise.
Bamidbar,34,16,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe, saying,"
Bamidbar,34,17,"These are the shmot of the anashim which shall apportion HaAretz unto you; El'azar HaKohen, and Yehoshua Ben Nun."
Bamidbar,34,18,And ye shall take one nasi of every matteh to possess HaAretz.
Bamidbar,34,19,"And the shmot of the anashim are these: Of the tribe of Yehudah, Kalev Ben Yephunneh;"
Bamidbar,34,20,"And of the tribe of the Bnei Shim'on, Shmuel Ben Ammihud;"
Bamidbar,34,21,"Of the tribe of Binyamin, Elidad Ben Kislon;"
Bamidbar,34,22,"And the nasi of the tribe of the Bnei Dan, Bukki Ben Yogli;"
Bamidbar,34,23,"The nasi of the Bnei Yosef, for the tribe of the Bnei Menasheh, Channi'el Ben Ephod;"
Bamidbar,34,24,"And the nasi of the tribe of the Bnei Ephrayim, Kemuel Ben Shiphtan;"
Bamidbar,34,25,"And the nasi of the tribe of the Bnei Zevulun, Elitzaphan Ben Parnakh;"
Bamidbar,34,26,"And the nasi of the tribe of the Bnei Yissakhar, Palt'iel Ben Azzan;"
Bamidbar,34,27,"And the nasi of the tribe of the Bnei Asher, Achihud Ben Shelomi;"
Bamidbar,34,28,"And the nasi of the tribe of the Bnei Naphtali, Pedahel Ben Ammihud;"
Bamidbar,34,29,These are they whom Hashem commanded to apportion the inheritance unto the Bnei Yisroel in Eretz Kena'an.
Bamidbar,35,1,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe in the plains of Moav by Yarden near Yericho, saying,"
Bamidbar,35,2,"Command the Bnei Yisroel, that they give unto the Levi'im from the nachalah of their achuzzah towns to dwell in; and ye shall give also unto the Levi'im open pasturelands around the towns."
Bamidbar,35,3,"And the towns shall they have to dwell in; and the open pasturelands of them shall be for their behemah, and for their livestock, and for all their animals."
Bamidbar,35,4,"And the open pasturelands of the towns, which ye shall give unto the Levi'im, shall reach from the wall of the Ir and outward a thousand cubits all around."
Bamidbar,35,5,"And ye shall measure from outside the Ir on the east side 2,000 cubits, and on the south side 2,000 cubits, and on the west side 2,000 cubits, and on the north side 2,000 cubits; and the Ir shall be in the midst; this shall be to them the open pasturelands of the towns."
Bamidbar,35,6,"And among the towns which ye shall give unto the Levi'im there shall be six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint for the rotze'ach, that he may flee to there; and to them ye shall add 42 ir."
Bamidbar,35,7,So all the arim (towns) which ye shall give to the Levi'im shall be 48 ir: them shall ye give with their migrashim (open pasturelands).
Bamidbar,35,8,And the arim (towns) which ye shall give shall be of the achuzzat Bnei Yisroel; from them that have many ye shall give more; but from them that have few ye shall give less; every one shall give of his arim unto the Levi'im according to his nachalah which he inheriteth.
Bamidbar,35,9,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe, saying,"
Bamidbar,35,10,"Speak unto the Bnei Yisroel, and say unto them, When ye be come over the Yarden into Eretz Kena'an,"
Bamidbar,35,11,"Then ye shall appoint you arim to be arei miklat (cities of refuge) for you; that the rotze'ach may flee to there, which killeth any nefesh bishegagah (unintentionally, accidently)."
Bamidbar,35,12,"And they shall be unto you arei miklat (cities of refuge) from the Go'el; that the rotze'ach die not, until he stand before the Edah in mishpat."
Bamidbar,35,13,And of these arim which ye shall give there shall be shesh arei miklat.
Bamidbar,35,14,"Ye shall give shlosh he'arim on this side of the Yarden, and shlosh he'arim shall ye give in Eretz Kena'an, which shall be arei miklat."
Bamidbar,35,15,"These shesh he'arim shall be for miklat (refuge) , both for the Bnei Yisroel, and for the ger, and for the toshav (sojourner) among them; that every one that killeth any nefesh bishegagah (unintentionally, accidently) may flee there."
Bamidbar,35,16,"And if he strike him with keli barzel, so that he die, he is a rotze'ach; the rotze'ach shall surely be put to death."
Bamidbar,35,17,"And if he strike him with an even (stone) in his yad that could kill, and he die, he is a rotze'ach; the rotze'ach shall surely be put to death."
Bamidbar,35,18,"Or if he strike him with a keli in his hand that could kill, and he die, he is a rotze'ach; the rotze'ach shall surely be put to death."
Bamidbar,35,19,"The Go'el HaDahm himself shall slay the rotze'ach; when he meeteth him, he shall slay him."
Bamidbar,35,20,"And if he push him out of sin'ah (hatred) , or hurl upon him bitzediyyah (with intention, by laying in wait) that he die;"
Bamidbar,35,21,"Or in eivah (enmity) strike him with his yad, that he die; he that struck him shall surely be put to death; for he is a rotze'ach; the Go'el HaDahm shall slay the rotze'ach, when he meeteth him."
Bamidbar,35,22,"But if he push him suddenly without eivah (enmity) , or have thrown upon him any keli with no tzediyyah (intention, laying in wait),"
Bamidbar,35,23,"Or with any even (stone) , that could kill, seeing him not, and cast it upon him, that he die, and was not his oyev, neither sought his ra'ah,"
Bamidbar,35,24,Then the Edah shall judge between the striker and the Go'el HaDahm according to these mishpatim;
Bamidbar,35,25,"And the Edah shall deliver the rotze'ach out of the yad Goel HaDahm, and the Edah shall restore him to his ir miklat, to which he fled; and he shall abide in it unto the mot HaKohen HaGadol which was mashach (anointed) with the shemen hakodesh."
Bamidbar,35,26,But if the rotze'ach shall at any time come outside the border of the ir miklat to which he fled;
Bamidbar,35,27,"And the Go'el HaDahm find him outside the gevul (borders, city limit) of his ir miklat, and the Go'el HaDahm kill the rotze'ach, he shall not be guilty of dahm,"
Bamidbar,35,28,Because he should have remained in his ir miklat until the mot HaKohen HaGadol; but after the mot HaKohen HaGadol the rotze'ach shall return into his eretz achuzzat.
Bamidbar,35,29,So these things shall be for a chukkat mishpat unto you throughout your dorot in all your dwellings.
Bamidbar,35,30,"Whosoever killeth any nefesh, the rotze'ach shall be put to death by the mouth of edim (witnesses) ; but ed echad (one witness) shall not testify against any nefesh to cause him to die."
Bamidbar,35,31,"Moreover ye shall take no kofer (ransom payment, satisfaction) for the nefesh of a rotze'ach, which is guilty of death; but he shall be surely put to death."
Bamidbar,35,32,And ye shall take no kofer for him that is fled to his ir miklat that he should come again to dwell in HaAretz until the mot HaKohen.
Bamidbar,35,33,"So ye shall not pollute HaAretz wherein ye are; for dahm pollutes HaAretz; and kapporah cannot be made for HaAretz for the shefach dahm therein, except by the dahm of him that committed shefach dahm (shedding of blood)."
Bamidbar,35,34,"Therefore, make not tameh HaAretz which ye shall inhabit, wherein I dwell; for I Hashem dwell among the Bnei Yisroel."
Bamidbar,36,1,"And the Rashei HaAvot of the Mishpekhot of the Bnei Gil'ad Ben Machir Ben Menasheh, of the Mishpekhot of the Bnei Yosef, came near, and spoke before Moshe, and before the Nasiim Rashei Avot of the Bnei Yisroel,"
Bamidbar,36,2,"And they said, When Hashem commanded adoni to give HaAretz for a nachalah by goral to the Bnei Yisroel, adoni was commanded by Hashem to give the nachalat Tzelophechad achinu unto his banot."
Bamidbar,36,3,"Now suppose they become married to any of the Bnei Shivtei Bnei Yisroel, and their nachalah be taken from the nachalah of Avoteinu, and be added to the nachalah of the matteh whereunto they marry into; so shall it be taken from the goral of our nachalah."
Bamidbar,36,4,"And when the Yovel of the Bnei Yisroel shall be, then shall their nachalah be added unto the nachalah of the matteh whereunto they marry into; so shall their nachalah be taken away from the nachalah of the matteh of Avoteinu."
Bamidbar,36,5,"And Moshe commanded the Bnei Yisroel according to the command of Hashem , saying, The matteh of the Bnei Yosef hath said well."
Bamidbar,36,6,"This is the thing which Hashem doth command concerning the Banot Tzelophechad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think best; only within the Mishpakhat Matteh Avihem shall they marry."
Bamidbar,36,7,So shall not the nachalah of the Bnei Yisroel remove from matteh to matteh; for every ish of the Bnei Yisroel shall keep himself to the nachalat matteh of his Avot.
Bamidbar,36,8,"And every bat, that possesseth a nachalah in mattot Bnei Yisroel, shall be isha unto one of the mishpakhat matteh of her av, that the Bnei Yisroel may possess every ish the nachalat of his avot."
Bamidbar,36,9,Neither shall the nachalah remove from one matteh (tribe) to another matteh (tribe) ; for the mattot (tribes) of the Bnei Yisroel shall make deveykus every ish to his own nachalah.
Bamidbar,36,10,"Even as Hashem commanded Moshe, so did the Banot Tzelophechad;"
Bamidbar,36,11,"For Machlah, Tirtzah, and Choglah, and Milcah, and No'ah, the Banot Tzelophechad, became nashim unto bnai dodeihen (sons of their uncles, i.e., cousins);"
Bamidbar,36,12,"And they became nashim into the mishpekhot Bnei Menasheh Ben Yosef, and their nachalah remained in the matteh (tribe) of the mishpakhat of their av."
Bamidbar,36,13,"These are the mitzvot and the mishpatim, which Hashem commanded by the yad Moshe unto the Bnei Yisroel in the plains of Moav by Yarden near Yericho."
