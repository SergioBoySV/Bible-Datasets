Yoel,1,1,The Devar Hashem that came to Yoel Ben Petuel:
Yoel,1,2,"Hear this, ye zekenim, and give ear, all ye yoshvei ha'aretz (inhabitants of the land) . Hath anything like this been in your days, or even in the days of your avot (fathers)?"
Yoel,1,3,"Tell ye your banim (children) of it, and let your banim tell their banim, and their banim to the next generation."
Yoel,1,4,That which the locust swarm hath left hath the arbeh (great locust) eaten; and that which the arbeh hath left hath the crawling locust eaten; and that which the crawling locust hath left hath the other locust eaten.
Yoel,1,5,"Awake, ye shikkorim (drunkards) , and weep; and wail, all ye drinkers of yayin, because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth."
Yoel,1,6,"For a Goy is come up upon my land, strong, and without number, whose teeth are the teeth of an aryeh (lion) , and he hath the fangs of a lioness."
Yoel,1,7,"He hath laid my gefen (vine) waste, and barked my teenah (fig tree) ; he hath made it clean bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are made white."
Yoel,1,8,Lament like a betulah girded with sackcloth for the ba'al (husband) of her youth.
Yoel,1,9,"The minchah and the nesekh is cut off from the Beis Hashem ; the kohanim, the mesharetim (ministers) of Hashem , mourn."
Yoel,1,10,"The sadeh (field) is wasted, the adamah (land) mourneth; for the grain is wasted; the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth."
Yoel,1,11,"Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; wail, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; because the katzir (harvest) of the sadeh is perished."
Yoel,1,12,"The gefen is dried up, and the teenah languisheth; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, even all the trees of the sadeh, are withered; because sasson (joy) is withered away from the bnei Adam."
Yoel,1,13,"Gird yourselves, and lament, ye kohanim; howl, ye mesharetim of the Mizbe'ach; come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye mesharetim of my G-d; for the minchah and the nesekh is withheld from the Beis of your G-d."
Yoel,1,14,"Sanctify ye a tzom (fast) , call an atzarah (solemn assembly) , gather the zekenim and all the yoshvei ha'aretz into the Beis Hashem Eloheichem, and cry unto Hashem,"
Yoel,1,15,"Alas for the day! For the Yom Hashem is karov (near, at hand) , and like destruction from Shaddai shall it come."
Yoel,1,16,"Is not the okhel (food) cut off before our eyes, yea, simchah (joy) and gladness from the Beis Eloheinu?"
Yoel,1,17,"The seed is rotten under their clods, the otzarot (storehouses) are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the grain is withered."
Yoel,1,18,"How do the beasts groan! The herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the edrei hatzon (flocks of sheep) are made desolate."
Yoel,1,19,"To Thee, Hashem , will I cry; for the eish hath devoured the pastures of the midbar, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field."
Yoel,1,20,"The beasts of the field cry also unto Thee; for the rivers of mayim (water) are dried up, and the eish hath devoured the pastures of the midbar."
Yoel,2,1,"Blow ye the shofar in Tziyon, and sound an alarm on My Har Kodesh; let all the yoshvei ha'aretz tremble; for the Yom Hashem cometh, for it is near at hand;"
Yoel,2,2,"A day of choshech and of gloominess, a day of anan (cloud) and of thick darkness, as the shachar (dawn) spread upon the mountains; an am rav (great people, army) and strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after it, even to the years of dor v'dor."
Yoel,2,3,"An eish devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth; ha'aretz is as the Gan Eden before them, and behind them a desolate midbar; yea, and nothing shall escape them."
Yoel,2,4,"The appearance of them is as the appearance of susim; and as horsemen, so shall they run."
Yoel,2,5,"Like the noise of merkavot (chariots) on the tops of mountains shall they leap, like the noise of a flame of eish that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people drawn up in milchamah (battle)."
Yoel,2,6,"Before their face, the amim (nations) shall be in anguish; every face turns pale."
Yoel,2,7,"They shall run like gibborim; they shall climb the chomah (wall) like anshei milchamah; and they shall march every one in formation, and they shall not swerve from their course;"
Yoel,2,8,"Neither shall one push another; they shall walk every one in his own column; and when they burst through defenses, they shall not break ranks."
Yoel,2,9,"They shall run to and fro in the ir (city) ; they shall run upon the chomah, they shall climb up into the batim (houses) ; they shall enter in at the windows like the ganav."
Yoel,2,10,"The eretz shall quake before them; the Shomayim shall tremble; the shemesh and the yarei'ach shall be dark, and the kokhavim shall withdraw their shining;"
Yoel,2,11,"And Hashem shall utter His voice before His army; His machaneh (camp) is very great; for the executor of His devar (word, command) is strong; for the Yom Hashem is gadol and very terrible; and who can endure it?"
Yoel,2,12,"Therefore also now, saith Hashem , turn ye back to Me with all your lev, and with tzom, and with weeping, and with mourning;"
Yoel,2,13,"And rend your lev, and not your garments, and turn unto Hashem Eloheichem; for He is channun (gracious) and rachum (merciful) , slow to anger, and of rav chesed, and He relents from sending calamity."
Yoel,2,14,"Who knoweth but that He will return and have pity, and leave behind Him a brocha; even a minchah and a nesekh unto Hashem Eloheichem?"
Yoel,2,15,"Blow the shofar in Tziyon, sanctify a tzom, call an atzarah (solemn assembly);"
Yoel,2,16,"Gather the people, set apart as kodesh the kahal (congregation) , assemble the zekenim, gather the olalim, even those nursing at the breast; let the choson go forth of his cheder, and the kallah out of her chuppah (canopy)."
Yoel,2,17,"Let the kohanim, the mesharetim of Hashem , weep between the Ulam and the Mizbe'ach, and let them say, Spare Thy people, Hashem , and make not Thine nachalah (inheritance) an object of scorn, a byword among the Goyim. Why should they say among the peoples, Where is their G-d?"
Yoel,2,18,"Then will Hashem be jealous for His land, and take pity on His people."
Yoel,2,19,"Yea, Hashem will answer and say unto His people, Hineni, I am sending you dagan, and tirosh, and yitzhar, and ye shall be satisfied therewith; and I will no more make you an object of scorn among the Goyim;"
Yoel,2,20,"But I will remove far off from you the northern [army], and will drive him into an eretz barren and desolate, with his vanguard toward the eastern sea, and his rearguard toward the western sea, and his stench and foul smell will go up. Surely it hath done great things."
Yoel,2,21,"Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice; for Hashem hath done great things."
Yoel,2,22,"Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field; for the pastures of the midbar do spring up, for the etz beareth her fruit, the te'enah and the gefen do yield their strength."
Yoel,2,23,"Be glad then, ye bnei Tziyon, and rejoice in Hashem Eloheichem; for He hath given you the former rain according to (His) tzedakah, and He will cause to come down for you the rain, the yoreh (former rain) , and the malkosh (latter rain) as before."
Yoel,2,24,"And the threshing floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with yayin and yitzhar."
Yoel,2,25,"And I will restore to you the shanim (years) that the arbeh (great locust) hath eaten, the crawling locust, and the other locust, and the locust swarm, My great army which I sent among you."
Yoel,2,26,"And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the Shem of Hashem Eloheichem, that hath dealt wondrously with you; and My people shall never be ashamed."
Yoel,2,27,"And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Yisroel, and that I am Hashem Eloheichem, and there is no other; and My people shall never be put to shame."
Yoel,2,28,"And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out My Ruach upon all basar; and your banim and your banot shall prophesy, your zekenim shall dream chalomot, your bochurim shall see chezyonot (visions):"
Yoel,2,29,And also upon the avadim and upon the shefachot in those days will I pour out My Ruach.
Yoel,2,30,"And I will show mofetim in the heavens and in the earth, dahm, and eish, and pillars of smoke."
Yoel,2,31,"The shemesh shall be turned into choshech, and the yarei'ach into dahm, before the great and terrible Yom Hashem come."
Yoel,2,32,"And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the Shem of Adonoi shall be saved; for in Mt Tziyon and in Yerushalayim shall be deliverance, as Hashem hath said, and in the seridim whom Hashem shall call."
Yoel,3,1,"For, hinei, in those days, and in that time, when I shall restore the fortunes of Yehudah and Yerushalayim,"
Yoel,3,2,"I will also gather all Goyim, and will bring them down into the valley of Yehoshafat, and will enter into judgment against them there concerning My people and for My nachalah Yisroel, whom they have scattered among the Goyim, and My land they divided up."
Yoel,3,3,"And they have cast lots for My people; and have traded the yeledim as barter for zonot, and sold the yaldah for yayin, that they might drink."
Yoel,3,4,"Yea, and what have ye to do with Me, O Tzor, and Tzidon, and all the coasts of Peleshet? Will ye render Me a pay-back? And if ye recompense Me, swiftly and speedily will I return your recompense upon your own rosh;"
Yoel,3,5,"Because ye have taken My kesef and My zahav, and have carried into your temples My goodly pleasant things:"
Yoel,3,6,"Also the Bnei Yehudah and the Bnei Yerushalayim have ye sold unto the Yevanim (Greeks) , that ye might remove them far from their territory."
Yoel,3,7,"Hineni, I will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold them, and will return your recompense upon your own rosh;"
Yoel,3,8,"And I will sell your banim and your banot into the hand of the Bnei Yehudah, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a Goy far off; for Hashem hath spoken it."
Yoel,3,9,"Proclaim ye this among the Goyim; Prepare milchamah, wake up the gibborim, let all the anshei hamilchamah draw near and attack;"
Yoel,3,10,"Beat your plow-blades into charavot (swords) and your pruning knives into spears; let the weak say, I am strong."
Yoel,3,11,"Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye Goyim, and gather yourselves together round about; Hashem , thither cause Thy gibborim to come down."
Yoel,3,12,"Let the Goyim be wakened, and come up to the valley of Yehoshafat; for there will I sit to judge all the Goyim round about."
Yoel,3,13,"Put ye in the sickle, for the katzir is ripe; go in, tread; for the winepress is full, the vats overflow; for their ra'ah is great."
Yoel,3,14,"Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision; for the Yom Hashem is near in the valley of decision."
Yoel,3,15,"The shemesh and the yarei'ach shall be darkened, and the kokhavim shall withdraw their shining."
Yoel,3,16," Hashem also shall roar out of Tziyon, and utter His voice from Yerushalayim; and the heavens and the earth shall shake; but Hashem will be the machseh (refuge) of His people, and the maoz of the Bnei Yisroel."
Yoel,3,17,"So shall ye have da'as that I am Hashem Eloheichem dwelling in Tziyon, My Har Kodesh; then shall Yerushalayim be kodesh, and there shall no zarim pass through her any more."
Yoel,3,18,"And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with cholov; and all the ravines of Yehudah shall flow with mayim, and a ma'ayon shall come forth out of the Beis Hashem , and shall water the valley of Sheetim."
Yoel,3,19,"Mitzrayim shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate midbar, for the chamas against the Bnei Yehudah, because they have shed dahm naki (innocent blood) in their land."
Yoel,3,20,"But Yehudah shall dwell for ever, and Yerushalayim from dor v'dor."
Yoel,3,21,For I will cleanse them of bloodguilt which I have not yet cleansed; for Hashem dwelleth in Tziyon.
