Ezra,1,1,"Now in the first year of Koresh Melech Paras (Persia) , that the Devar Hashem by the mouth of Yirmeyah might be fulfilled, Hashem stirred up the ruach of Koresh Melech Paras (Persia) , so that he made a proclamation throughout all his Malchut, and put it also in writing, saying,"
Ezra,1,2,"Thus saith Koresh Melech Paras (Persia), Hashem Elohei HaShomayim hath given me all the kingdoms of ha'aretz; and he hath charged me to build him Beis at Yerushalayim, which is in Yehudah."
Ezra,1,3,"Who is there among you of all His people, Elohav be with him, let him go up to Yerushalayim, which is in Yehudah, and build the Beis Hashem Elohei Yisroel, (He is HaElohim) which is in Yerushalayim."
Ezra,1,4,"And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with kesef, and with zahav, and with goods, and with livestock, beside the nedavah (freewill offering) for the Beis HaElohim that is in Yerushalayim."
Ezra,1,5,"Then rose up the chief of the avot of Yehudah and Binyamin, and the kohanim, and the Levi'im, with all them whose ruach HaElohim had stirred up, to go up to build the Beis Hashem which is in Yerushalayim."
Ezra,1,6,"And all they that were about them did strengthen their hands with vessels of kesef, with zahav, with goods, and with livestock, and with precious things, in addition to all their nedavot (freewill offerings)."
Ezra,1,7,"Also HaMelech Koresh brought forth the vessels of the Beis Hashem , which Nevukhadnetzar had carried off out of Yerushalayim, and had put them in the bais (temple) of his g-ds;"
Ezra,1,8,"Even those did Koresh Melech Paras (Persia) bring forth by the hand of Mitredat the treasurer, and counted them unto Sheshbatzar, the Nasi of Yehudah."
Ezra,1,9,"And this is the number of them; thirty basins of zahav, a thousand basins of kesef, nine and twenty knives,"
Ezra,1,10,"Thirty bowls of zahav, kesef basins of a second kind four hundred and ten, and other vessels one thousand."
Ezra,1,11,All the vessels of zahav and of kesef were five thousand and four hundred. All these did Sheshbatzar bring up with them of the Golus that were brought up from Bavel unto Yerushalayim.
Ezra,2,1,"Now these are the people of the province that went up out of the captivity, of those of the Golus, whom Nevukhadnetzar Melech Bavel had carried away unto Babylon, and returned unto Yerushalayim and Yehudah, every one unto his town;"

Ezra,2,62,"These sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy, but they were not found; therefore were they, as polluted, put from the kehunah."
Ezra,2,63,"And the Tirshata (Governor) said unto them, that they should not eat of kodesh hakodashim, until there stood up a kohen with Urim and with Tummim."
Ezra,2,64,The Kol HaKahal together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore.
Ezra,2,65,This was in addition to their avadim (man servants) and their amahot (female servants) of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven; and there were among them two hundred singing men and singing women.
Ezra,2,66,"Their susim were seven hundred thirty and six; their mules, two hundred forty and five;"
Ezra,2,67,"Their camels, four hundred thirty and five; their donkeys, six thousand seven hundred and twenty."
Ezra,2,68,"And some of the chief of the avot, when they came to the Beis Hashem which is at Yerushalayim, offered nedavot for the Beis HaElohim to rebuild it in its place."
Ezra,2,69,"They gave according to their ability unto the Otzar for the work threescore and one thousand drachmas of zahav, and five thousand minas of kesef, and one hundred ketanot for the kohanim."
Ezra,2,70,"So the kohanim, and the Levi'im, and some of the people, and the singers, and the gatekeepers, and the Netinim (servants of the Beis Hamikdash) , dwelt in their towns, and kol Yisroel in their towns."
Ezra,3,1,"And when the seventh month was come, and the Bnei Yisroel were in the towns, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Yerushalayim."
Ezra,3,2,"Then stood up Yeshua ben Yotzadak, and his brethren the kohanim, and Zerubavel ben Sh'altiel, and his brethren, and built the Mizbe'ach Elohei Yisroel, to offer olot (burnt offerings) thereon, as it is written in the Torat Moshe Ish HaElohim."
Ezra,3,3,"And they set the Mizbe'ach upon its bases; despite their fear upon them because of the people of those lands, they offered olot (burnt offerings) thereon unto Hashem , even olot boker and erev."
Ezra,3,4,"They kept also the Chag HaSukkot, as it is written, and offered the daily olah by number, according to the mishpat, as the duty of every yom required;"
Ezra,3,5,"And afterward offered the olat tamid, both of the chodeshim, and of all the Mo'adim of Hashem that were set apart as kodesh, and of every one that willingly offered a nedavah (freewill offering) unto Hashem."
Ezra,3,6,From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer olot (burnt offerings) unto Hashem . But the Yesod (Foundation) of the Heikhal Hashem was not yet laid.
Ezra,3,7,"They gave kesef also unto the chotzvim (masons, stone-cutters) , and to the charashim (craftsmen, carpenters) ; and food, and mishteh (drink) , and shemen (oil) , unto them of Tzidon, and to them of Tzor, to bring cedar trees from Levanon to the sea and on to Yafo, according to the rishyon (authorization, grant) that they had of Koresh Melech Paras (Persia)."
Ezra,3,8,"Now in the second year of their coming unto the Beis HaElohim at Yerushalayim, in the second month, began Zerubavel ben Sh'altiel, and Yeshua ben Yotzadak, and the she'ar (remnant) of their brethren the kohanim and the Levi'im, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Yerushalayim; and appointed the Levi'im, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the melechet Beis Hashem (work of the construction of the Beis Hamikdash)."
Ezra,3,9,"Then stood Yeshua with his banim and his brethren, Kadmiel and his banim, the Bnei Yehudah, together, to set forward the workmen in the Beis HaElohim; the Bnei Chenadad, with their banim and their brethren the Levi'im."
Ezra,3,10,"And when the Bonim (Builders) laid the foundation of the Heikhal Hashem , they set the kohanim in their robes with trumpets, and the Levi'im the Bnei Asaph with cymbals, to praise Hashem according to the instructions of Dovid Melech Yisroel."
Ezra,3,11,"And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto Hashem because He is good, for His chesed endureth forever toward Yisroel. And kol haAm shouted with a great shout, when they praised Hashem , because the foundation of the Beis Hashem was laid."
Ezra,3,12,"But many of the kohanim and Levi'im and chief of the avot, who were zekenim (ancient men) , that had seen the Beis HaRishon, when the foundation of this Beis was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice, and many shouted aloud for simchah;"
Ezra,3,13,"So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of simchah from the noise of the weeping of the people; for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off."
Ezra,4,1,"Now when the adversaries of Yehudah and Binyamin heard that the Banim of the Golus were the Bonim (Builders) of the Heikhal for Hashem Elohei Yisroel,"
Ezra,4,2,"Then they came to Zerubavel, and to the chief of the avot, and said unto them, Let us build with you, for we seek Eloheichem, as ye do, and we do sacrifice unto Him since the days Esar-Chaddon Melech Ashur (Assyria) , which brought us here."
Ezra,4,3,"But Zerubavel, and Yeshua, and the rest of the chief of the avot of Yisroel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build a Beis unto Eloheinu; but we alone will build unto Hashem Elohei Yisroel, as HaMelech Koresh (Cyrus) Melech Paras (Persia) hath commanded us."
Ezra,4,4,"Then the Am HaAretz weakened the hands of the Am Yehudah, and troubled them from building,"
Ezra,4,5,"And hired counselors against them, to frustrate their etza (plan) , all the days of Koresh (Cyrus) Melech Paras (Persia) , even until the reign of Daryavesh (Darius) Melech Paras (Persia)."
Ezra,4,6,"And in the reign of Achashverosh, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote unto him a sitnah (accusation ), against the inhabitants of Yehudah and Yerushalayim."
Ezra,4,7,"Then, in the days of Artachshasta, it was Bishlam, Mitredat, Tavel, and the rest of their companions, who wrote unto Artachshasta Melech Paras (Persia) ; and the writing of the letter was written in Aramaic script, and set forth in Aramaic."
Ezra,4,8,Rechum the high commissioner and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Yerushalayim to Melech Artachshasta as follows;
Ezra,4,9,"Then wrote Rechum the high commissioner, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions; the judges, the officials, the Tarplim, the Apharsim, the Arkvim, the Babylonians, and those of Shushan, that is, the Elma'im,"
Ezra,4,10,"And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnapar deported, and settled in the city of Shomron, and elsewhere in Beyond-the-River wrote; and now"
Ezra,4,11,"This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, even unto Artachshasta HaMelech; From thy avadim, the men Beyond-the-River; and now"
Ezra,4,12,"May it be known unto the Melech, that the Yehudim which came up from thee to us are come unto Yerushalayim, building the rebellious and the wicked city, and finishing its walls, and repairing the foundations."
Ezra,4,13,"Be it known now unto the Melech, that, if this city be built, and the walls set up again, then they will not pay tax, tribute, or duty, and so thou shalt damage the royal revenues."
Ezra,4,14,"Now because we have covenant maintenance (“share the Kingʼs salt”) from the palace, and it was not proper for us to see the dishonor of the Melech, therefore we have sent and informed the Melech,"
Ezra,4,15,"That search may be made in the sefer of the archives of thy avot; so shalt thou find in the sefer of the archives, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto melachim and provinces, a place of sedition from ancient times, for which cause was this city destroyed."
Ezra,4,16,"We inform the Melech that, if this city be built again, and the walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no possession in the province Beyond-the-River."
Ezra,4,17,"Then the Melech sent an answer: Unto Rechum the high commissioner, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Shomron (Samaria) , and unto the rest Beyond-the-River, Shalom, and now"
Ezra,4,18,The nish'tevan (official document) which ye sent unto us hath been fully read before me;
Ezra,4,19,"And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city for a long time hath made insurrection against melachim, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein."
Ezra,4,20,"There have been mighty melachim also over Yerushalayim, which have ruled over all territory Beyond-the-River, to whom tax, tribute, and duty were paid."
Ezra,4,21,"Give ye now ta'am (command) to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not built, until another ta'am shall be given from me."
Ezra,4,22,Take heed now that ye fail not to do this; lamah (why) should damage grow to the hurt of the Melech?
Ezra,4,23,"Now when the copy of letter of Melech Artachshasta was read before Rechum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Yerushalayim unto the Yehudim, and made them to cease by force and compulsion."
Ezra,4,24,Then ceased the work of the Beis HaElohim which is at Yerushalayim. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Daryavesh (Darius) Melech Paras (Persia).
Ezra,5,1,"Then the nevi'im, Chaggai HaNavi, and Zecharyah ben Iddo, prophesied unto the Yehudim that were in Yehudah and Yerushalayim in the shem Elohei Yisroel, Who was [in authority] over them."
Ezra,5,2,"Then rose up Zerubavel ben She'alti'el, and Yeshua ben Yotzadak, and began to build the Beis Elohim which is at Yerushalayim; and with them were the nevi'im of Elohim helping them."
Ezra,5,3,"At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor of the province Beyond-the-River, and Shetar-Boznai and their companions, and said thus unto them, Who hath authorized you to build this Beis, and to finish this structure?"
Ezra,5,4,Then said we unto them accordinging what were the shmot of the men that are constructing this building.
Ezra,5,5,"But the Ayn Eloheihem (Eye of their G-d) was upon the leaders of the Yehudim, that they could not cause them to cease, until the matter came to Daryavesh (Darius) ; and then answer was returned by letter concerning this matter."
Ezra,5,6,"The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor of the province Beyond-the-River, and Shetar-Boznai and his companions the envoys which were in the province Beyond-the-River, sent unto Daryavesh (Darius) the Melech;"
Ezra,5,7,"They sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus: Unto Daryavesh HaMelech, all Shalom."
Ezra,5,8,"Be it known unto the Melech, that we went into the province of Yehudah, to the Beis of the great Elohim, which is being built with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth fast on, and prospereth in their hands."
Ezra,5,9,"Then asked we those leaders, and said unto them thus, Who commanded you to build this Beis, and to restore this structure?"
Ezra,5,10,"We asked their shmot also, to inform thee, that we might write down the shmot of the men that were their heads for thy information."
Ezra,5,11,"And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the avadim of the Elohei Shomayim va'Aretz, and build the Beis that was built these many years ago, which a great Melech Yisroel built and set up."
Ezra,5,12,"But because Avoteinu had provoked the Elohei Shomayim unto them into the hand of Nevukhadnetzar Melech Bavel, the Kasdai (Chaldean) , who destroyed this Beis, and carried the people away into the Golus of Bavel (Babylon)."
Ezra,5,13,But in the first year of Koresh (Cyrus) Melech Bavel the same Melech Koresh made a decree to build this Beis Elohim.
Ezra,5,14,"And the vessels also of zahav and kesef of the Beis Elohim, which Nevukhadnetzar took out of the Heikhal that was in Yerushalayim, and brought into the Heikhal of Babylon, those did Koresh the Melech take out of the Heikhal of Babylon, and they were delivered unto one, whose shem was Sheshbatzar, whom he had made governor;"
Ezra,5,15,"And said unto him, Take these vessels, go, deposit them into the Heikhal that is in Yerushalayim, and let the Beis Elohim be built in its place."
Ezra,5,16,"Then came the same Sheshbatzar, and laid the foundation of the Beis Elohim which is in Yerushalayim; and since that time even until now hath it been under construction, and yet it is not finished."
Ezra,5,17,"Now therefore, if it seem good to the Melech, let there be search made in the bais of royal archives, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Koresh (Cyrus) the Melech to build this Beis Elohim at Yerushalayim, and let the Melech send his pleasure to us concerning this matter."
Ezra,6,1,"Then Daryavesh (Darius) the Melech made a decree, and search was made in the bais of the archives, where the treasures were stored in Babylon."
Ezra,6,2,"And there was found at Achmeta, in the palace that is in the province of the Medes, a megillah, and therein was a record thus written;"
Ezra,6,3,"In the first year of Koresh the Melech, Koresh the Melech made a decree concerning the Beis Elohim at Yerushalayim, Let the Beis be built, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof threescore cubits;"
Ezra,6,4,"With three courses of great stones, and a course of new timber; and let the expenses be given out of the Melechʼs treasury;"
Ezra,6,5,"And also let the vessels of zahav and kesef of the Beis Elohim, which Nevukhadnetzar took forth out of the Heikhal which is at Yerushalayim, and brought unto Babylon, be returned, and brought again unto the Heikhal which is at Yerushalayim, every one to its place, and deposit them in the Beis Elohim."
Ezra,6,6,"Now therefore, Tatnai, governor Beyond-the-River, Shetar-Boznai, and your companions the envoys, which were in the province Beyond-the-River, you stay far from there!"
Ezra,6,7,Let the work of this Beis Elohim alone; let the governor of the Yehudim and the leaders of the Yehudim build this Beis Elohim in its place.
Ezra,6,8,"Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the leaders of these Yehudim for the building of this Beis Elohim; that of the royal treasuries, even of the revenue of the province Beyond-the-River, forthwith expenses be given unto these men, that they be not hindered."
Ezra,6,9,"And that which they have need of, both young bulls, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the Elohei Shomayim, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the request of the kohanim which are at Yerushalayim, let it be given them day by day without fail;"
Ezra,6,10,"That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the Elohei Shomayim, and pray for the chayyei Melech, and of his banim."
Ezra,6,11,"Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let timber be pulled down from his bais, and being set up, let him be impaled hanging dead thereon; and let his bais be made a dunghill for this."
Ezra,6,12,And the Elohim that hath caused Shmo to dwell there destroy all Melech or Am that shall lift up their hand to alter and to destroy this Beis Elohim which is at Yerushalayim. I Daryavesh have issued a decree; let it be done with speed.
Ezra,6,13,"Then Tatnai, governor of Beyond-the-River, Shetar-Boznai, and their companions, according to that which Daryavesh the Melech had sent, so they did speedily."
Ezra,6,14,"And the leaders of the Yehudim built, and they prospered through the prophesying and preaching of Chaggai HaNavi and Zecharyah ben Iddo. And they built, and finished it, according to the commandment of the Elohei Yisroel, and according to the commandment of Koresh (Cyrus) , and Daryavesh (Darius) , and Artachshasta (Artaxerxes) Melech Paras (Persia)."
Ezra,6,15,"And this Beis was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Daryavesh the Melech."
Ezra,6,16,"And the Bnei Yisroel, the Kohanim, and the Levi'im, and the rest of the Banim of the Golus, kept the dedication of this Beis Elohim with joy."
Ezra,6,17,"And offered at the dedication of this Beis Elohim one hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin offering for kol Yisroel, twelve he-goats, according to the number of the tribes of Yisroel."
Ezra,6,18,"And they installed the kohanim in their divisions, and the Levi'im in their courses, for the Avodas Elohim, which is at Yerushalayim, as it is written in the Sefer Moshe."
Ezra,6,19,And the Banim of the Golus kept the Pesach upon the 14 th day of the first month.
Ezra,6,20,"For the Kohanim and the Levi'im made themselves tahor, all of them were tehorim, and slaughtered the Pesach for all the Banim of the Golus, and for their brethren the Kohanim, and for themselves."
Ezra,6,21,"And the Bnei Yisroel, which were come again out of Golus, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the tum'a of the Goyim of ha'aretz, to seek Hashem Elohei Yisroel, did eat,"
Ezra,6,22,"And kept the Chag Matzot seven days with simchah; for Hashem had made them joyful, and turned the lev Melech Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the Beis Elohim, Elohei Yisroel."
Ezra,7,1,"Now after these things, in the reign of Artachshasta Melech Paras (Persia) , Ezra ben Serayah ben Azaryah ben Chilkiyah,"
Ezra,7,2,"Ben Shallum, ben Tzadok, ben Achituv,"
Ezra,7,3,"Ben Amaryah, ben Azaryah, ben Merayot,"
Ezra,7,4,"Ben Zerachyah, ben Uzzi, ben Bukki,"
Ezra,7,5,"Ben Avishua, ben Pinchas, ben El'azar, ben Aharon HaKohen HaRosh;"
Ezra,7,6,"This Ezra went up from Babylon, and he was a sofer mahir expert in the Torat Moshe, which Hashem Elohei Yisroel had given, and HaMelech granted him all his request, for the yad Hashem Elohav was upon him."
Ezra,7,7,"And there went up some of the Bnei Yisroel, and of the Kohanim, and the Levi'im, and the singers, and the gatekeepers, and the Netinim, unto Yerushalayim, in the seventh year of Artachshasta HaMelech."
Ezra,7,8,"And he came to Yerushalayim in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the Melech."
Ezra,7,9,"For upon the first day of the first month he began to go up from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month he came to Yerushalayim, for the good yad Elohav was upon him."
Ezra,7,10,"For Ezra had prepared his lev to study the Torat Hashem , and to do it, and to teach in Yisroel chok and mishpat."
Ezra,7,11,"Now this is the copy of the letter that HaMelech Artachshasta gave unto Ezra HaKohen, HaSofer, even a Sofer of the divrei mitzvot Hashem , and of his chukkot for Yisroel:"
Ezra,7,12,"Artachshasta, Melech Melachim, unto Ezra Kohen, Sofer of the law of Elohei Shomayim, Greetings! And now"
Ezra,7,13,"I issued a decree, that all they of the Am Yisroel, and of Kohanim and Levi'im, in my kingdom, which are minded of their own freewill to go up to Yerushalayim, go with thee."
Ezra,7,14,"Forasmuch as thou art sent of the Melech, and of his seven counselors, to inquire concerning Yehudah and Yerushalayim, according to the law of thy G-d which is in thine hand;"
Ezra,7,15,"And to carry the kesef and zahav, which the Melech and his counselors have freely offered unto the Elohei Yisroel, Whose habitation is in Yerushalayim,"
Ezra,7,16,"And all the kesef and zahav that thou canst find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people, and of the Kohanim, offering willingly for the Beis Eloheihem which is in Yerushalayim;"
Ezra,7,17,"That thou mayest buy speedily with this kesef bulls, rams, lambs, with their minchot and their nesakhim, and offer them upon the Mizbe'ach of the Beis Eloheichem which is in Yerushalayim."
Ezra,7,18,"And whatsoever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren, to do with the rest of the kesef and the zahav, that do according to the will of Eloheichem."
Ezra,7,19,"The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the Beis of thy G-d, those deliver thou before the Elohei Yerushalayim."
Ezra,7,20,"And whatsoever more shall be needful for the Beis of thy G-d, which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the bais of treasuries of the Melech."
Ezra,7,21,"And I, even I Artachshasta the Melech, do issue a decree to all the treasurers which are in Beyond-the-River, that whatsoever Ezra HaKohen, the Sofer of the law of the Elohei Shomayim, shall require of you, it be done speedily,"
Ezra,7,22,"Unto one hundred talents of kesef, and to one hundred cors of wheat, and to one hundred baths of wine, and to one hundred baths of oil, and unlimited melach (salt)."
Ezra,7,23,"Whatsoever is commanded by Elohei Shomayim, let it be diligently done for the Beis of Elohei Shomayim; for why should there be ketzaf (wrath) against the malchut of the Melech and his banim?"
Ezra,7,24,"Also we make known to you, that touching any of the Kohanim and Levi'im, singers, gatekeepers, Netinim, or ministers of this Beis Elohim, it shall not be lawful to impose tax, tribute, or duty, upon them."
Ezra,7,25,"And thou, Ezra, after the chochmah of thy G-d, that is in thine hand, set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the people that are in Beyond-the-River, all such as know the laws of thy G-d; and teach ye them that know them not."
Ezra,7,26,"And whosoever will not do the law of thy G-d, and the law of the Melech, let punishment be executed speedily upon him, whether it be unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment."
Ezra,7,27,"Baruch Hashem Elohei Avoteinu, Who hath put such a thing as this in the lev HaMelech, to honor the Beis Hashem which is in Yerushalayim;"
Ezra,7,28,"And hath extended chesed unto me before HaMelech, and his counselors, and before all the mighty officials of the Melech. And I was strengthened because the Yad Hashem Elohai was upon me, and I gathered together out of Yisroel chief men to go up with me."
Ezra,8,1,"These are now the Rashei Avoteihem, and this is the register of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of Artachshasta the Melech:"
Ezra,8,2,"Of the Bnei Pinchas, Gershom; of the Bnei Itamar, Daniel; of the Bnei Dovid, Chattush;"
Ezra,8,3,"Of the Bnei Shechanyah, of the Bnei Parosh, Zecharyah; and with him were reckoned by register of the zachar 150."
Ezra,8,4,"Of the Bnei Pachat-Moav, Elyeho'einai ben Zerachyah, and with him 200 zachar."
Ezra,8,5,"Of the Bnei Shechanyah, ben Yachaziel, and with him 300 zachar."
Ezra,8,6,"Of the banim also of Adin, Eved ben Yonatan, and with him 50 zachar."
Ezra,8,7,"And of the Bnei Eilam, Yeshayah ben Atalyah, and with him 70 zachar."
Ezra,8,8,"And of the Bnei Shephatyah, Zevadyah ben Micha'el, and with him 80 zachar."
Ezra,8,9,"Of the Bnei Yoav, Ovadyah ben Yechiel, and with him 218 zachar."
Ezra,8,10,"And of the Bnei Shelomit, ben Yosiphyah, and with him 160 zachar."
Ezra,8,11,"And of the Bnei Bevai, Zecharyah ben Bevai, and with him 28 zachar."
Ezra,8,12,"And of the Bnei Azgad, Yochanan ben Hakkatan, and with him 110 zachar."
Ezra,8,13,"And of the younger Bnei Adonikam, whose shmot are these, Eliphelet, Ye'iel, and Shema'yah, and with them 60 zachar."
Ezra,8,14,"Of the banim also of Bigvai, Utai, and Zakkur, and with them 70 zachar."
Ezra,8,15,"And I gathered them together by the river that runneth to Ahava, and there abode we in tents three days; and I reviewed the people, and the Kohanim, and found there none of the Bnei Levi."
Ezra,8,16,"Then sent I for Eli'ezer, for Ariel, for Shema'yah, and for Elnatan, and for Yariv, and for Elnatan, and for Natan, and for Zecharyah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Yoyariv, and for Elnatan, men of discernment."
Ezra,8,17,"And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place called Kasiphya, and I told them what they should say unto Iddo, and to his brethren the Netinim, at the place Kasiphya, that they should bring unto us ministers for the Beis Eloheinu."
Ezra,8,18,"And by the good Yad of Eloheinu upon us they brought us an Ish Seichel, of the Bnei Machli, ben Levi, ben Yisroel; and Sherevyah, with his banim and his brethren, eighteen;"
Ezra,8,19,"And Chashavyah, and with him Yeshayah of the Bnei Merari, his brethren and their banim, twenty;"
Ezra,8,20,"Also of the Netinim, whom Dovid and the sarim (princes) had appointed for the Avodas HaLevi'im, two hundred and twenty Netinim; all of them were registered by shemot."
Ezra,8,21,"Then I proclaimed a tzom there, at the Ahava River, that we might afflict ourselves before Eloheinu, to seek of Him a derech yesharah for us, and for our little ones, and for all our possessions."
Ezra,8,22,"For I was ashamed to require of the Melech a band of soldiers and parashim to protect us against the enemy on the road; because we had spoken unto the Melech, saying, The Yad Eloheinu is upon all them for tovah that seek Him, but His power and His wrath is against all them that forsake Him."
Ezra,8,23,"So we did a tzom and besought Eloheinu for this, and He was entreated of us."
Ezra,8,24,"Then I separated twelve of the chief of the Kohanim, Sherevyah, Chashavyah, and ten of their brethren with them,"
Ezra,8,25,"And weighed out unto them the kesef, and the zahav, and the vessels, even the terumat Beis Eloheinu, which the Melech, and his counselors, and his officials, and kol Yisroel there present, had given as an offering."
Ezra,8,26,"I even weighed out unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of kesef, and vessels of kesef one hundred talents, and of zahav one hundred talents;"
Ezra,8,27,"Also twenty bowls of zahav, of a thousand darics; and two vessels of nechoshet, precious as zahav."
Ezra,8,28,"And I said unto them, Ye are kodesh unto Hashem ; the vessels are kodesh also; and the kesef and the zahav are a nedavah unto Hashem Elohei Avoteichem."
Ezra,8,29,"Watch ye, and guard them, until ye weigh them before the chief of the Kohanim and the Levi'im, and chief of the avot of Yisroel, at Yerushalayim, in the chambers of the Beis Hashem."
Ezra,8,30,"So took the kohanim and the Levi'im the weight of the kesef, and the zahav, and the vessels, to bring them to Yerushalayim unto the Beis Eloheinu."
Ezra,8,31,"Then we departed from the Ahava River on the twelfth day of the first month, to go unto Yerushalayim; and the Yad Eloheinu was upon us, and delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and the bandit laying in wait along the Derech (road)."
Ezra,8,32,"And we came to Yerushalayim, and abode there three days."
Ezra,8,33,"Now on the fourth day was the kesef and the zahav and the vessels weighed in the Beis Eloheinu by the yad of Meremot ben Uriyah HaKohen; and with him was El'azar ben Pinchas; and with them was Yozavad ben Yeshua, and Noadyah ben Binnui, the Levi'im;"
Ezra,8,34,By mispar (number) and by weight of every one; and all the weight was written at that time.
Ezra,8,35,"Also the children of those that had been carried away, the Bnei HaGolus, offered olot unto Elohei Yisroel, twelve bulls for kol Yisroel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he-goats for a sin offering; all this was an olah unto Hashem."
Ezra,8,36,"And they delivered the orders of the Melech unto the Satraps of the Melech, and to the governors of Beyond-the-River and they gave support to HaAm, and the Beis HaElohim."
Ezra,9,1,"Now when these things were completed, the sarim came to me, saying, HaAm Yisroel, and the Kohanim, and the Levi'im, have not separated themselves from the Am HaAretz, doing according to their abominations, even of the Kena'ani, the Chitti, the Perizzi, the Yevusi, the Ammoni, the Moavi, the Egyptians, and the Emori."
Ezra,9,2,"For they have taken of their banot for themselves, and for their banim, so that the zera hakodesh have mingled themselves with the Am HaAretz; yea, the yad of the sarim (princes) and officials hath been chief in this trespass."
Ezra,9,3,"And when I heard this thing, I made keriah of my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down appalled."
Ezra,9,4,"Then were assembled around me every one that trembled at the Divrei Elohei Yisroel, because of the transgression of those of the Golus; and I sat appalled until the minchat haerev."
Ezra,9,5,"And at the minchat haerev I arose up from my abasement, and having made the keriah of my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto Hashem Elohai,"
Ezra,9,6,"And davened, O Elohai, I am ashamed and am disgraced to lift up my face to thee, Elohai, for avonoteinu are increased over our head, and ashmateinu (our guilt) is reached up unto Shomayim."
Ezra,9,7,"Since the days of Avoteinu have we been in a great trespass unto this day; and for avonoteinu have we, our melachim, and our Kohanim, been delivered into the hand of the melachim of the lands, to the cherev, to captivity, and to spoil, and to humiliation of face, as it is this day."
Ezra,9,8,"And now for a little space grace hath been shown from Hashem Eloheinu, to leave us to escape a she'ar (remnant) , and to give us a peg in his Makom Kodesh, that Eloheinu may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage."
Ezra,9,9,"For we were avadim; yet Eloheinu hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended chesed unto us in the sight of the Melachim of Paras (Persia) , to give us a reviving, to set up the Beis Eloheinu, and to repair the ruins thereof, and to give us a wall in Yehudah and in Yerushalayim."
Ezra,9,10,"And now, O Eloheinu, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken Thy mitzvot,"
Ezra,9,11,"Which Thou hast commanded by Thy avadim the nevi'im, saying, HaAretz, unto which ye go to possess it, is an eretz niddah (unclean land) with the filthiness of the Am HaAretz, with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their tum'a."
Ezra,9,12,"Now therefore give not your banot unto their banim, neither take their banot unto your banim, nor further their shalom or their prosperity ad olam, that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land and leave it for your banim ad olam."
Ezra,9,13,"And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great guilt, seeing that Thou Eloheinu hast punished us less than avoneinu deserve, and hast given us such deliverance as this,"
Ezra,9,14,"Should we again break Thy mitzvot, and join in affinity with the people of these to'evot (abominations) ? Wouldest not Thou be angry with us till Thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no she'erit (remnant) nor escaping?"
Ezra,9,15," Hashem Elohei Yisroel, Thou art tzaddik; for we remain yet escaped, as it is this day; hineni, we are before Thee in our guilt, though we cannot stand before Thee because of it."
Ezra,10,1,"Now while Ezra was davening and making vidduy, weeping and prostrating himself before the Beis HaElohim, a Kahal rav me'od, anashim, nashim, and yeladim, gathered to him from Yisroel, for the people wept bitterly."
Ezra,10,2,"And Shechanyah ben Yechiel, of the Bnei Eilam, answered and said to Ezra, We have been unfaithful to Eloheinu, have married foreign am ha'aretz women; yet now there is mikveh for Yisroel in spite of this."
Ezra,10,3,"So now let us make a Brit with Eloheinu to put away all nashim and that born of them, according to the counsel of Adonoi and the charedim at the mitzvot of Eloheinu; and let it be done according to the Torah."
Ezra,10,4,Arise! For this matter is your responsibility; but we will be with you; chazak and act.
Ezra,10,5,"Then Ezra rose and made the leading Kohanim, the Levi'im, and kol Yisroel take an oath that they would do according to this proposal; so they took the oath."
Ezra,10,6,"Then Ezra arose from before the Beis HaElohim and went into the chamber of Yehochanan ben Elyashiv. Although he went there, he did not eat lechem, nor drink water, for he was mourning over the unfaithfulness of those of the Golus."
Ezra,10,7,"And they issued a proclamation throughout Yehudah and Yerushalayim to all the Banim of the Golus, that they should assemble at Yerushalayim,"
Ezra,10,8,"And that whoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the sarim and the zekenim, all his possessions should be forfeited and he himself excluded from the Kahal of those of the Golus."
Ezra,10,9,"So all the men of Yehudah and Binyamin assembled at Yerushalayim within the three days. It was the ninth month on the twentieth of the month, and kol HaAm sat in the rechov before the Beis HaElohim, distressed by the occasion and the heavy rain."
Ezra,10,10,"Then Ezra HaKohen stood up and said to them, You have been unfaithful and have married foreign women adding to Ashmat Yisroel."
Ezra,10,11,"Now, therefore, make confession to Hashem Elohei Avoteichem and do His will; separate yourselves from the am ha'aretz and from the foreign women."
Ezra,10,12,"Then Kol HaKahal answered and said with a kol gadol, Ken! As you have said, so it is our duty to do."
Ezra,10,13,"But there are Am rav, it is the rainy season, and we are not able to stand bachotz (outside) . Nor can the matter be done in one or two days, for we have transgressed greatly in this matter."
Ezra,10,14,"Let our leaders represent the Kol HaKahal and let all those in our towns who have married foreign women come at appointed times, together with the ziknei ir and shofetim of each town until the charon af Eloheinu on account of this matter is turned away from us."
Ezra,10,15,Only Yonatan ben Asahel and Yachzeyah ben Tikvah supported by Meshullam and Shabetai the Levi stood opposed.
Ezra,10,16,"But the Banim of the Golus did so. And Ezra HaKohen selected anashim who were Rashei HaAvot for each of their fatherʼs households, all of them by shemot. So they convened on the first day of the tenth month to investigate the matter."
Ezra,10,17,And they finished investigating all men who had married foreign women by the 1 st day of the 1 st month.
Ezra,10,18,"And among the Bnei HaKohanim who had married foreign women were found of the Bnei Yeshua ben Yotzadak, and his brothers; Ma'aseiyah, Eli'ezer, Yariv, and Gedalyah."
Ezra,10,19,"And they pledged to put away their women, and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their asham."
Ezra,10,20,And of the Bnei Immer there were Chanani and Zevadyah;
Ezra,10,21,"and of the Bnei of Charim; Ma'aseiyah, Eliyah, Shema'yah, Yechiel, and Uziyah;"
Ezra,10,22,"and of the Bnei of Pashchur; Elyo'einai, Ma'aseiyah, Yishmael, Netanel, Yozavad, and El'asah."
Ezra,10,23,"And of Levi'im there were Yozavad, Shime'i, Kelayah (that is, Kelita) , Petachyah, Yehudah, and Eli'ezer."
Ezra,10,24,"And of the singers there was Elyashiv; and of the gatekeepers; Shallum, Telem, and Uri."
Ezra,10,25,"And of Yisroel, of the Bnei of Parosh there were Remiyah, Yizziyah, Malchiyah, Miyamin, El'azar, Malkiyah, and Benayah;"
Ezra,10,26,"And of the Bnei Eilam; Matanyah, Zecharyah, Yechiel, Avdi, Yeremot, and Eliyah;"
Ezra,10,27,"And of the Bnei Zattu; Elyo'einai, Elyashiv, Matanyah, Yeremot, Zavad, and Aziza;"
Ezra,10,28,"And of the Bnei Bevai; Yehochanan, Chananyah, Zabbai, and Atlai;"
Ezra,10,29,"And of the Bnei Bani; Meshullam, Malluch, and Adayah, Yashuv, Sheal, and Ramot;"
Ezra,10,30,"And of the Bnei Pachat-Moav; Adna, Kelal, Benayah, Ma'aseiyah, Matanyah, Betzalel, Binnui, and Menasheh;"
Ezra,10,31,"And of the Bnei Charim; Eli'ezer; Yishiyah, Malkiyah, Shema'yah, Shim'on,"
Ezra,10,32,"Binyamin, Malluch, and Shemaryah;"
Ezra,10,33,"Of the Bnei of Chashum; Matnai, Mattattah, Zavad, Eliphelet, Yeremai, Menasheh, and Shime'i;"
Ezra,10,34,"Of the Bnei Bani; Ma'adai, Amram, U'el,"

Ezra,10,38,"Bani, Binnui, Shime'i,"
Ezra,10,39,"Shelemyah, Natan, Adayah,"
Ezra,10,40,"Machnavdai, Shashai, Sharai,"
Ezra,10,41,"Azare'el, Shelemyah, Shemaryah,"
Ezra,10,42,"Shallum, Amaryah, and Yosef."
Ezra,10,43,"Of the Bnei Nevo there were Ye'iel, Mattityah, Zavad, Zevina, Yaddai, Yoel, and Benayah."
Ezra,10,44,"All these had taken foreign women, and some of them wives by whom they had banim."
