Ruth,1,1,"Now it came to pass in the yamim when HaShofetim (the Judges) ruled, that there was a ra'av (famine) in the land. And a certain ish (man) of Beit-Lechem Yehudah went to sojourn in the sadei Moav, he, and his isha (wife) , and his two banim (sons)."
Ruth,1,2,"And the shem (name) of the ish (man) was Elimelech, and the shem (name) of his isha (wife) Naomi, and the shem of his two banim Machlon and Kilyon, Ephrathites of Beit-Lechem Yehudah. And they came into the sadei Moav, and continued there."
Ruth,1,3,"And Elimelech, Naomi始s husband, died; and she was left (alive) and her two banim."
Ruth,1,4,"And they took them wives of the nashim (women) of Moav; the shem (name) of the one was Orpah, and the shem (name) of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about eser shanim (ten years)."
Ruth,1,5,"And Machlon and Kilyon died also both of them; and the isha was left (alive) , surviving with neither her yeladim nor her ish."
Ruth,1,6,"Then she arose with her kallot, that she might make teshuvah (return) from the sadei Moav: for in the sadeh of Moav she had heard how that Hashem had visited His people in giving them lechem (bread)."
Ruth,1,7,"Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two kallot with her; and they set on the derech (way, road) to make teshuvah (return) unto Eretz Yehudah."
Ruth,1,8,"And Naomi said unto her two kallot, Go, go back each to her beis em (mother始s house) : may Hashem show chesed (lovingkindness) to you, as ye have dealt with hamesim (the dead ones) , and with me."
Ruth,1,9," Hashem grant you that ye may find menuchah (resting place) , each of you in the bais of her ish. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept."
Ruth,1,10,"And they said unto her, Surely we will make teshuvah (return) with thee unto thy people."
Ruth,1,11,"And Naomi said, Turn back, my banot; why will ye go with me? Are there yet any more banim in my womb, that they may be your husbands?"
Ruth,1,12,"Turn back, my banot, go your way; for I am too old to have an ish. If I should say, I have tikvah, if I should have an ish halailah (tonight) , and should also bear banim,"
Ruth,1,13,"Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? Would ye stay from having ba'alim (husbands) for them? Nay, my banot; for it is more mar (bitter) for me than you, for the Yad Hashem has gone out against me."
Ruth,1,14,"And they lifted up their voice, and wept again; and Orpah kissed her chamot; but Ruth clung unto her."
Ruth,1,15,"And she said, Hinei, thy sister-in-law is gone back unto her people, and unto her g-ds; return thou after thy sister-in-law."
Ruth,1,16,"And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee; for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge; thy people shall be my people, and thy G-d shall be Elohai;"
Ruth,1,17,"Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried. Hashem do so to me, and more also, if anything but HaMavet part thee and me."
Ruth,1,18,"When she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her, then she left urging her."
Ruth,1,19,"So they two went until they came to Beit-Lechem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Beit-Lechem, that kol ha'ir (all the town) was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?"
Ruth,1,20,"And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara; for Shaddai hath dealt very bitterly with me."
Ruth,1,21,"I went away full and Hashem hath brought me back empty; why then call me Naomi, seeing Hashem hath testified against me, and Shaddai hath made me very bitter?"
Ruth,1,22,"So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her kallah, with her, which returned out of the sadei Moav; and they came to Beit-Lechem in the beginning of katzir seorim (barley harvest)."
Ruth,2,1,"And Naomi had a relative of her husband始s, an ish gibbor chayil, of the mishpochah of Elimelech; and shmo was Boaz."
Ruth,2,2,"And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the sadeh, and glean heads of grain after him in whose sight I shall find chen (grace, favor) . And she said unto her, Go, my daughter."
Ruth,2,3,"And she went, and came, and gleaned in the sadeh behind the kotzerim (harvesters) ; and it so happened that she came on a part of the sadeh belonging unto Boaz, who was of the mishpochah of Elimelech."
Ruth,2,4,"And, hinei, Boaz came from Beit-Lechem, and said unto the kotzerim, Hashem be with you. And they answered him, Yevarech'chah Adonoi( Hashem bless thee)."
Ruth,2,5,"Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the kotzerim, Whose na'arah is this?"
Ruth,2,6,"And the servant that was set over the kotzerim answered and said, It is the na'arah from Moav that came back with Naomi out of the sadeh of Moav."
Ruth,2,7,"And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the kotzerim among the omarim (sheaves) ; so she came, and hath worked steadily from the boker even until now, except for a short rest in the bais."
Ruth,2,8,"Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another sadeh, neither go from hence, but abide here close by my ne'arot;"
Ruth,2,9,"Let thine eyes be on the sadeh that they do reap, and go thou after them; have I not charged the ne'arim that they shall not touch thee? And when thou art athirst, go unto the kelim (vessels) , and drink of that which the ne'arim have drawn."
Ruth,2,10,"Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found chen (favor, grace) in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a nokhriyah (foreigner, alien)?"
Ruth,2,11,"And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shown me, all that thou hast done unto thy chamot since the mot (death) of thine ish; and how thou hast left thy av and thy em, and the eretz moledet, and art come unto an Am (people) which thou knewest not heretofore."
Ruth,2,12," Hashem recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of Hashem Elohei Yisroel, under Whose wings thou art come to seek refuge."
Ruth,2,13,"Then she said, Let me find chen (favor, grace) in thy sight, adoni; for that thou hast brought nachamah (comfort) to me, and for that thou hast spoken to the lev of thine shifcha, though I be not like unto one of thine shfakhot."
Ruth,2,14,"And Boaz said unto her, At et haokhel (mealtime) come thou hither, and eat of the lechem, and dip thy morsel in the chometz. And she sat beside the kotzerim; and he offered her roasted grain, and she did eat, and was filled, and had left over."
Ruth,2,15,"And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his ne'arim, saying, Let her glean even among the omarim, and reproach her not;"
Ruth,2,16,"And let fall also some of the handfuls on purpose for her, and leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not."
Ruth,2,17,"So she gleaned in the sadeh until the erev, and she threshed what she had gleaned; and it was about an ephah of seorim."
Ruth,2,18,"And she took it up, and went into the town; and her chamot saw what she had gleaned; and she brought forth, and gave to her the left over after she had been filled."
Ruth,2,19,"And her chamot said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned hayom (today) ? And where did you work? Baruch be he who did take knowledge of thee. And she showed her chamot with whom she had worked, and said, Shem HaIsh with whom I worked hayom (today) is Boaz."
Ruth,2,20,"And Naomi said unto her kallah, Baruch hu l' Hashem asher lo azav chasdo et haChayyim v'et haMesim (Blessed be he of Hashem who hath not abandoned his chesed to the living and to the dead) . And Naomi said unto her, The man is karov unto us. MiGoaleinu hu (he is one of our kinsmen redeemers)."
Ruth,2,21,"And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt keep close by my ne'arim, until they have ended kol HaKatzir that is mine."
Ruth,2,22,"And Naomi said unto Ruth her kallah, It is tov, my daughter, that thou go out with his ne'arot, because in someone else始s sadeh you might be harmed."
Ruth,2,23,So she kept close by the ne'arot of Boaz to glean unto the end of katzir haseorim and of katzir chittim; and dwelt with her chamot.
Ruth,3,1,"Then Naomi her chamot said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek manoach (a resting place) for thee, that it may be well with thee?"
Ruth,3,2,"And now is not Boaz our relative, with whose ne'arot thou wast? Hinei, he winnoweth haseorim halailah in the threshing floor."
Ruth,3,3,"Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the threshing floor; but make not thyself known unto the Ish, until he shall have done eating and drinking."
Ruth,3,4,"And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the makom (place) where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do."
Ruth,3,5,"And she said unto her, Kol that thou sayest unto me I will do."
Ruth,3,6,"And she went down unto the threshing floor, and did according to kol that her chamot bade her."
Ruth,3,7,"And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his lev was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain; and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down."
Ruth,3,8,"And it came to pass in the middle of the night, that the man was afraid, and turned himself; and, hinei, an isha lay at his feet!"
Ruth,3,9,"And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine handmaid; spread therefore thy robe over thine amah (handmaid) ; for thou art a Go'el (Redeemer)."
Ruth,3,10,"And he said, Berukhah at la Hashem , my daughter; for thou hast showed more chesed in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not the bochurim, whether poor or rich."
Ruth,3,11,"And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest; for kol sha'ar ami doth have da'as that thou art an aishes chayil (virtuous woman)."
Ruth,3,12,And now it is true that I am thy Go'el; howbeit there is a Go'el karov mimeini (Redeemer nearer than I).
Ruth,3,13,"Tarry this night, and it shall be in the boker, that if he will perform unto thee the part of a Go'el, well; let him do the Go'el始s part; let him redeem you. But if he will not do the part of a Go'el to thee, then will I do the part of a Go'el to thee, as Hashem liveth. Lie down until HaBoker."
Ruth,3,14,"And she lay at his feet until HaBoker; and she rose up before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that an isha came into the threshing floor."
Ruth,3,15,"Also he said, Bring the mitpachat (shawl) that thou hast upon thee, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six measures of seorim (barley) and laid it on her; and she went into the town."
Ruth,3,16,"And when she came to her chamot, she said, Who art thou, my daughter? And she told her all that HaIsh had done to her."
Ruth,3,17,"And she said, These six measures of seorim gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty-handed unto thy chamot (mother-in-law)."
Ruth,3,18,"Then said she, Wait, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall; for HaIsh will not rest until the matter is settled HaYom."
Ruth,4,1,"Then went Boaz up to the sha'ar, and sat him down there; and, hinei, the Go'el of whom Boaz spoke came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! Turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down."
Ruth,4,2,"And he took a minyan of the zekenim of the town, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down."
Ruth,4,3,"And he said unto the Go'el, Naomi, that is come again out of the sadeh of Moav, selleth a share of sadeh, which was achinu (our brother) Elimelech始s;"
Ruth,4,4,"And I thought to advise thee, saying, Buy it before the inhabitants, and before the zekenim of my people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it; but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know; for there is none to redeem it beside thee; and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem it."
Ruth,4,5,"Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the sadeh of the hand of Naomi, thou must acquire Ruth the Moabitess, the eshet hamet (wife of the dead man) , lahakim (to raise up, resurrect) the shem hamet upon his nachalah (inheritance)."
Ruth,4,6,"And the Go'el said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine own nachalah; redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot redeem it."
Ruth,4,7,"Now this was the manner in former time in Yisroel concerning the geulah (redemption) and concerning the temurah (the substitute, exchange) , for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his sandal, and gave it to his neighbor; and this was an attestation in Yisroel."
Ruth,4,8,"Therefore the Go'el said unto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he drew off his sandal."
Ruth,4,9,"And Boaz said unto the zekenim, and unto kol haAm, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech始s, and all that was Kilyon始s and Machlon始s, of the hand of Naomi."
Ruth,4,10,"Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Machlon, have I purchased to be my wife, lahakim (to raise up, resurrect) the shem hamet (name of the dead man) upon his nachalah, that the shem of the dead man be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the sha'ar of his place; ye are edim (witnesses) HaYom."
Ruth,4,11,"And kol HaAm that were in the sha'ar, and the zekenim, said, We are edim. Hashem make the isha haba'ah (the woman coming), into thine bais like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the Bais Yisroel; and do thou worthily in Ephrat, and be famous in Beit-Lechem;"
Ruth,4,12,"And let thy bais be like the bais of Peretz, whom Tamar bore unto Yehudah, of the zera which Hashem shall give thee of this na'arah."
Ruth,4,13,"So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his isha; and when he went in unto her, Hashem gave her conception, and she bore ben."
Ruth,4,14,"And the nashim said unto Naomi, Baruch Hashem , which hath not left thee this yom without a Go'el. May shmo be famous in Yisroel."
Ruth,4,15,"And may he restore your nefesh and be a nourisher of thine old age; for thy kallah, which loveth thee, which is better to thee than shiva banim, hath born him."
Ruth,4,16,"And Naomi took the yeled, and laid him in her kheyk (bosom) , and became omenet (nurse) unto it."
Ruth,4,17,"And the women her shchenim gave him a name, saying, There is a ben born to Naomi; and they called his name Oved; he is the father of Yishai, the father of Dovid."
Ruth,4,18,"Now these are the toldot of Peretz; Peretz fathered Chetzron,"
Ruth,4,19,"And Chetzron fathered Ram, and Ram fathered Amminadav,"
Ruth,4,20,"And Amminadav fathered Nachshon, and Nachshon fathered Salmon,"
Ruth,4,21,"And Salmon fathered Boaz, and Boaz fathered Oved,"
Ruth,4,22,"And Oved fathered Yishai, and Yishai fathered Dovid."
