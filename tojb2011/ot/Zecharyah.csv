Zecharyah,1,1,"In the chodesh hashmini (eighth month) , in the shnat shtayim (second year) of Daryavesh, came the Devar Hashem unto Zecharyah ben Berechyah ben Iddo HaNavi, saying,"
Zecharyah,1,2, Hashem hath been very angry with your avot.
Zecharyah,1,3,"Therefore, say thou unto them, Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os: Return ye unto Me, saith Hashem Tzva'os, and I will return to you, saith Hashem Tzva'os."
Zecharyah,1,4,"Do not be like your avot, unto whom the nevi'im harishonim preached, saying, Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os: Turn ye now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings; but they did not hear, nor listen to Me, saith Hashem."
Zecharyah,1,5,"Your avot, where are they? And the nevi'im, do they live hal'olam (forever)?"
Zecharyah,1,6,"But My devarim and My chukkim, which I commanded My avadim hanevi'im, did they not overtake your avot? And they made teshuvah and said, Just as Hashem Tzva'os determined to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath He dealt with us."
Zecharyah,1,7,"Upon the four and twentieth yom of the eleventh chodesh, which is the chodesh Shevat, in the shnat shtayim of Daryavesh, came the Devar Hashem unto Zecharyah, ben Berechyah ben Iddo, HaNavi, saying,"
Zecharyah,1,8,"I had a vision by halailah, and, hinei, a man riding upon a sus adom (a red-brown horse) , and he stood among the myrtles that were in the hollow; and behind him there were susim: red-brown, sorrel, and white."
Zecharyah,1,9,"Then said I, O adoni, what are these? And the malach that spoke with me said unto me, I will show thee what these are."
Zecharyah,1,10,"And the man that stood among the myrtles answered and said, These are they whom Hashem hath sent to patrol ha'aretz."
Zecharyah,1,11,"And they reported to the Malach Hashem that stood among the myrtles, and said, We have patrolled ha'aretz, and, hinei, kol ha'aretz is quiet, and at peace."
Zecharyah,1,12,"Then the Malach Hashem answered and said, O Hashem Tzva'os, until when wilt Thou withhold mercy on Yerushalayim and on the towns of Yehudah, against which Thou hast been angry these threescore and ten shanah?"
Zecharyah,1,13,And Hashem answered the Malach that spoke with me with devarim tovim and with comforting words.
Zecharyah,1,14,"So the malach that communed with me said unto me, Preach, saying, Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os; I have been jealous for Yerushalayim and for Tziyon with a kina gedolah (great jealousy)."
Zecharyah,1,15,"And I am very angry with the Goyim that are [self] secure; for I was but a little angry, and they added to the ra'ah."
Zecharyah,1,16,"Therefore thus saith Hashem : I am returning to Yerushalayim with rachamim; My Beis shall be rebuilt in her, saith Hashem Tzva'os; and a measuring line shall be stretched forth upon Yerushalayim."
Zecharyah,1,17,"Preach also, saying, Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os; My towns will overflow with tov; and Hashem shall yet comfort Tziyon, and shall yet choose Yerushalayim."
Zecharyah,1,18,"Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and hinei four keranot (horns, powers)!"
Zecharyah,1,19,"And I said unto the malach that spoke with me, What are these? And he answered me, These are the keranot which have scattered Yehudah, Yisroel, and Yerushalayim."
Zecharyah,1,20,And Hashem showed me arba'ah charashim (four craftsmen).
Zecharyah,1,21,"Then said I, What come these to do? And he spoke, saying, These are the keranot which have scattered Yehudah, so that no man did lift up his head; but these [craftsmen] are come to terrify them, to throw down the karnot haGoyim, which lifted up their keren (horn) over Eretz Yehudah to scatter her."
Zecharyah,2,1,"I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and, hinei, a man with a measuring line in his hand!"
Zecharyah,2,2,"Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Yerushalayim, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof."
Zecharyah,2,3,"And, hinei, the malach that spoke with me went forth, and another malach went out to meet him,"
Zecharyah,2,4,"And said unto him, Run, speak to this na'ar (young man) saying, Yerushalayim shall be inhabited like unwalled cities because of the multitude of men and cattle therein;"
Zecharyah,2,5,"For I, saith Hashem , will be unto her a chomat eish (wall of fire) round about, and will be the kavod in the midst of her."
Zecharyah,2,6,"Come, come, and flee out of the Eretz Tzafon, saith Hashem ; for I have scattered you like the Arbah Ruchot HaShomayim, saith Hashem."
Zecharyah,2,7,"Come, save thyself, O Tziyon, thou that dwellest with the Bat Bavel."
Zecharyah,2,8,For thus saith Hashem Tzva'os: After Kavod (Glory) sent me unto the Goyim who plundered you — the one that toucheth you toucheth the apple of His eye —
Zecharyah,2,9,"Hineni, I will surely raise Mine hand against them, and they shall be plunder to their avadim; and ye shall know that Hashem Tzva'os hath sent me."
Zecharyah,2,10,"Sing and rejoice, O Bat Tziyon; for, hineni, I will come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith Hashem."
Zecharyah,2,11,"And Goyim rabbim shall be joined to Hashem in Yom HaHu (that day) , and shall be Ami (My People) : and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that Hashem Tzva'os hath sent me unto thee."
Zecharyah,2,12,"And Hashem shall inherit Yehudah as His chelek in the Admat HaKodesh (Holy Land) , and shall choose Yerushalayim again."
Zecharyah,2,13,"Be silent, Kol Basar, before Hashem ; for He has roused Himself from His Ma'on Kadosh (holy habitation)."
Zecharyah,3,1,"And he showed me Yehoshua the Kohen HaGadol standing before the Malach Hashem , and HaSatan standing at his right hand to accuse him."
Zecharyah,3,2,"And Hashem said unto HaSatan, Hashem rebuke thee, O HaSatan; even Hashem that hath chosen Yerushalayim rebuke thee. Is not this a brand, a burning stick, snatched out of the eish?"
Zecharyah,3,3,"Now Yehoshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the malach."
Zecharyah,3,4,"And he answered and spoke unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, See, I have taken away thine avon (iniquity, guilt) from thee, and I will clothe thee with machalatzot (extra fine, white clothing)."
Zecharyah,3,5,"And I said, Let them set a tzanif tahor (clean turban), upon his head. So they set a tzanif tahor upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the Malach Hashem stood by."
Zecharyah,3,6,"And the Malach Hashem testified unto Yehoshua, saying,"
Zecharyah,3,7,"Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os: If thou shalt walk in My ways, and if thou shalt keep My charge, then thou shalt also judge My Beis, and shalt also keep My courts, and I will give thee ways to walk among these standing here."
Zecharyah,3,8,"Hear now, O Yehoshua the Kohen HaGadol, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee, for they are Anshei Mofet (men of portent) ; for, hinei, I will bring forth Avdi Tzemach (My Servant, the Branch)."
Zecharyah,3,9,"For hinei the even (stone) that I have set before Yehoshua; upon one even (stone) shall be shivah einayim (seven eyes) ; hineni, I will engrave the inscription thereof, saith Hashem Tzva'os, and I will remove the avon (iniquity, guilt) of that land in Yom Echad."
Zecharyah,3,10,"In Yom HaHu, saith Hashem Tzva'os, shall ye invite every man his neighbor under the vine and under the fig tree."
Zecharyah,4,1,"And the malach that spoke with me returned, and awakened me, like a man that is wakened out of his sleep."
Zecharyah,4,2,"And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and hinei a menorat zahav, solid gold, with an oil vessel upon the top of it, and shivah nerot (lamps) thereon, and shivah tubes to the shivah nerot (lamps) , which are upon the top thereof:"
Zecharyah,4,3,"And two zeytim (olive trees) by it, one upon the right side of the oil vessel, and the other upon the left side thereof."
Zecharyah,4,4,"So I answered and spoke to the malach that spoke with me, saying, What are these, adoni?"
Zecharyah,4,5,"Then the malach that spoke with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, Lo (no) , adoni."
Zecharyah,4,6,"Then he answered and spoke unto me, saying, This is the Devar Hashem unto Zerubavel, saying, Not by might, nor by ko'ach (power) , but by My Ruach, saith Hashem Tzva'os."
Zecharyah,4,7,"Who art thou, O har hagadol (great mountain) , before Zerubavel? Thou shalt become a plain; and he shall bring forth the even haroshah (cornerstone) thereof with shoutings, crying, Chen, chen (Grace, grace) unto it."
Zecharyah,4,8,"Moreover the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Zecharyah,4,9,The hands of Zerubavel have laid the Yesod (foundation) of this Beis; his hands shall also finish it; then thou shalt know that Hashem Tzva'os hath sent me unto you.
Zecharyah,4,10,"For who hath despised the Yom Ketannot (day of small things) ? For they shall have simcha, and shall see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubavel with these shivah; they are the eyes of Hashem , which run to and fro throughout kol ha'aretz."
Zecharyah,4,11,"Then I replied by asking him, What are these two olive trees upon the right side of the menorah and upon the left side thereof?"
Zecharyah,4,12,"And I asked again, and said unto him, What are these two branches of the zeytim which through the two golden sprouts pour the gold-colored oil out of themselves?"
Zecharyah,4,13,"And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, Lo (no) , adoni."
Zecharyah,4,14,"Then said he, These are the two bnei hayitzhar (sons of oil) , that stand by Adon Kol Ha'aretz."
Zecharyah,5,1,"Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and hinei a megillah flying!"
Zecharyah,5,2,"And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered: I see a megillah flying; the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits."
Zecharyah,5,3,"Then said he unto me, This is ha'alah (the curse) that goeth forth over the face of kol ha'aretz; for every ganav that stealeth shall be purged out according to what it says on one side of the megillah; and every perjurer that sweareth falsely shall be purged out according to what it says on the other side."
Zecharyah,5,4,"I will send it forth, saith Hashem Tzva'os, and it shall enter into the bais haganav, and into the bais of him that sweareth falsely biShmi (by My Name) ; and it shall remain inside his bais, and shall destroy it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof."
Zecharyah,5,5,"Then the malach that spoke with me came forward, and said unto me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what is this that cometh into view."
Zecharyah,5,6,"And I said, What is it? And he said, This is the eifah (measuring basket) going out. He said moreover, This is their appearance throughout kol ha'aretz."
Zecharyah,5,7,"And, hinei, there was lifted up a lead cover; and there was an isha (woman) yoshevet (sitting) inside the eifah (measuring basket)!"
Zecharyah,5,8,"And he said, This is HaRishah (The Wickedness) . And he pushed her inside the eifah; and he pushed the lead cover over the mouth of the eifah."
Zecharyah,5,9,"Then lifted I up mine eyes, and looked, and, hinei, there came forth two nashim (women) , and the ruach (wind) was in their kenafayim (wings) ; for they had kenafayim (wings) like the kenafayim of a stork: and they lifted up the eifah between ha'aretz and HaShomayim."
Zecharyah,5,10,"Then said I to the malach that spoke with me, Whither are these taking the eifah?"
Zecharyah,5,11,"And he said unto me, To build it a bais in Eretz Shinar (Babylon) ; and it shall be placed there and set upon its own base."
Zecharyah,6,1,"And I looked again, and lifted up mine eyes, and, hinei, there came arbah merkavot (four chariots) and they were coming out from between two harim (mountains) ; and the harim were harim of nechoshet (bronze)."
Zecharyah,6,2,In the merkavah harishonah were red-brown susim; and in the merkavah hashenit susim shechorim (black horses);
Zecharyah,6,3,"And in the merkavah hashlishit susim levanim (white horses) ; and in the merkavah harevi'it speckled, powerful susim."
Zecharyah,6,4,"Then I answered and said unto the malach that spoke with me, What are these, adoni?"
Zecharyah,6,5,"And the malach answered and said unto me, These are the arba ruchot HaShomayim, which go forth from standing before Adon Kol HaAretz."
Zecharyah,6,6,The one with the susim shechorim (black horses) go forth toward the eretz tzafon (land of the north) ; and the levanim (white ones) go forth after them; and the speckled go forth toward the eretz hateyman (land of the south).
Zecharyah,6,7,"And the powerful ones went forth, and strained to go around to and fro throughout ha'aretz; and He said, Get you hence, go to and fro throughout ha'aretz. So they went to and fro throughout ha'aretz."
Zecharyah,6,8,"Then called He to me, and spoke unto me, saying, Look, these that go toward the eretz tzafon have given rest to My Ruach in the eretz tzafon."
Zecharyah,6,9,"And the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Zecharyah,6,10,"Take of them of the Golus, even of Cheldai, of Toviyah, and of Yedayah, which have arrived from Babylon, and thou go into the bais of Yoshiyah ben Tzephanyah;"
Zecharyah,6,11,"Then take kesef and zahav, and make atarot (crowns) , and set them upon the rosh Yehoshua ben Yehotzadak, the Kohen HaGadol,"
Zecharyah,6,12,"And speak unto him, saying, Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os: Hinei Ish, TZEMACH Shmo; and out of his place yitzmach (he [Moshiach] shall sprout up), and he shall build the Heikhal Hashem."
Zecharyah,6,13,"It is he who shall build the Heikhal Hashem ; and he shall carry hod (majesty) , and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a kohen upon his throne; and the atzat shalom (counsel of peace) shall be between them both."
Zecharyah,6,14,"And the atarot (crowns) shall be to Chelem, and to Toviyah, and to Yedayah, and to Chen ben Tzephanyah, for a memorial in the Heikhal Hashem."
Zecharyah,6,15,"And they that are far off shall come and build the Heikhal Hashem , and ye shall know that Hashem Tzva'os hath sent me unto you. And this shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the kol (voice) Hashem Eloheichem."
Zecharyah,7,1,"And it came to pass in the shnat arba of Daryavesh HaMelech, that the Devar Hashem came unto Zecharyah in the fourth of the chodesh hateshi'i (ninth month) , even in Kislev;"
Zecharyah,7,2,"And Beit-El had sent Sar-Etzer and Regem-Melech, and their men, to make entreaty for favor before Hashem,"
Zecharyah,7,3,"And to speak unto the kohanim which were in the Beis Hashem Tzva'os, and to the nevi'im, saying, Should I mourn in the fifth month, hinnazer (separating myself by fasting) , as I have done these so many shanim?"
Zecharyah,7,4,"Then came the Devar Hashem Tzva'os unto me, saying,"
Zecharyah,7,5,"Speak unto kol Am Ha'Aretz, and to the kohanim, saying, When ye did a tzom and mourned in the fifth and seventh, even these past shivim shanah, did ye at all fast the tzom unto Me, even to Me?"
Zecharyah,7,6,"And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves?"
Zecharyah,7,7,"Should ye not hear the devarim which Hashem hath preached by the nevi'im harishonim, when Yerushalayim was inhabited and at ease, and the towns thereof round about her, when men inhabited the Negev and the Shefelah?"
Zecharyah,7,8,"And the Devar Hashem came unto Zecharyah, saying,"
Zecharyah,7,9,"Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os, saying, Administer mishpat emes. And let every man show chesed and rachamim to his brother;"
Zecharyah,7,10,"And oppress not the almanah, nor the yetomim, the ger, nor the aniyim; and let none of you imagine ra'ah against his brother in your lev."
Zecharyah,7,11,"But they refused to heed, and stubbornly stiffened their shoulders, stopped up their oznayim, that they not hear."
Zecharyah,7,12,"Yea, they made their hearts as shamir (diamond), and would not yield in mishma'at (obedience) to the Torah and the devarim which Hashem Tzva'os hath sent by His Ruach through the hand of the nevi'im harishonim; therefore came a ketzef gadol (great wrath) from Hashem Tzva'os."
Zecharyah,7,13,"Therefore it is come to pass, that as He called, and they would not hear; so they called, and I would not hear, saith Hashem Tzva'os;"
Zecharyah,7,14,"But I dispersed them with a whirlwind among kol HaGoyim which they had not known. Thus HaAretz was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned; for they laid the Eretz Chemdat (Desired Land) desolate."
Zecharyah,8,1,"Again the Devar Hashem Tzva'os came to me, saying,"
Zecharyah,8,2,Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os; I am jealous for Tziyon with kina gedolah (great jealousy) and I am jealous for her with chemah gedolah (great fury).
Zecharyah,8,3,"Thus saith Hashem : I will return unto Tziyon, and will dwell in the midst of Yerushalayim; and Yerushalayim shall be called Ir HaEmes; and Har Hashem Tzva'os, Har HaKodesh."
Zecharyah,8,4,"Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os: Zekenim and zekenot shall yet dwell in the rechovot of Yerushalayim, and every man with his staff in his hand me'rov yamim (because of many days)."
Zecharyah,8,5,And the rechovot of the city shall be full of yeladim and yeladot playing in the rechovot thereof.
Zecharyah,8,6,"Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os; If it be marvellous in the eyes of the she'erit HaAm HaZeh in those days, should it also be marvellous in Mine eyes? saith Hashem Tzva'os."
Zecharyah,8,7,"Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os: Hineni, I will save My people from the eretz mizrach (land of the east) , and from the eretz of the setting sun;"
Zecharyah,8,8,"And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Yerushalayim; and they shall be My people, and I will be their G-d, in emes and in tzedakah."
Zecharyah,8,9,"Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os: Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these devarim by the mouth of the nevi'im, on the yom that the Yesod of the Beis Hashem Tzava'os was laid, the Heikhal, that it may be built."
Zecharyah,8,10,"For before these days there was no sachar for man, nor any sachar for beast; neither was there any shalom to him that went out or came in because of the tzar (oppressor) ; for I set all men every one against his neighbor."
Zecharyah,8,11,"But now I will not be unto the she'erit HaAm HaZeh as in the former days, saith Hashem Tzva'os."
Zecharyah,8,12,"For the zera is of shalom; the gefen shall yield her fruit, and ha'aretz shall give her increase, and HaShomayim shall give their tal; and I will cause the she'erit HaAm HaZeh to possess all these things for a nachalah."
Zecharyah,8,13,"And it shall come to pass, that as ye were a kelalah (curse) among the Goyim, O Bais Yehudah, and Bais Yisroel; so will I save you, and ye shall be a brocha; fear not, but let your hands be strong."
Zecharyah,8,14,"For thus saith Hashem Tzva'os: As I determined to bring rah on you, when your avot provoked Me to wrath, saith Hashem Tzava'os, and I relented not with rachamim:"
Zecharyah,8,15,So again have I determined in these days to do good unto Yerushalayim and to Bais Yehudah; fear ye not.
Zecharyah,8,16,"These are the things that ye must do: Speak ye every man emes to his neighbor; execute the judgment of mishpat shalom in your she'arim (gates, courts);"
Zecharyah,8,17,"And let none of you imagine ra'ah in your levavot against his neighbor; and love no shevuat sheker (false oath) ; for all these are things that I hate, saith Hashem."
Zecharyah,8,18,"And the Devar Hashem Tzva'os came unto me, saying,"
Zecharyah,8,19,"Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os: The tzom of the fourth month, and the tzom of the fifth, and the tzom of the seventh, and the tzom of the tenth, shall be to the Bais Yehudah for sasson and simcha, and mo'adim tovim; therefore love emes and shalom."
Zecharyah,8,20,"Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os: It shall yet come to pass, that there shall come amim (nations) , and the inhabitants of many cities;"
Zecharyah,8,21,"And the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, Let us go speedily to make entreaty before Hashem , and to seek Hashem Tzva'os. I myself am going."
Zecharyah,8,22,"Yea, amim rabbim and Goyim powerful shall come to seek Hashem Tzva'os in Yerushalayim, and to daven before Hashem."
Zecharyah,8,23,"Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os: In those days it shall come to pass, that asarah anashim (ten men) out of kol leshonot HaGoyim (all the tongues of the nations) shall take hold, even take hold of the hem of the robe of a Yehudi (Jew) , saying, Let us go with you; for we have heard that Elohim is with you."
Zecharyah,9,1,"The burden of the Devar Hashem against Eretz Chadrakh, and Damascus its menuchah (resting place) ; for toward Hashem shall be the eyes of man as of Kol Shivtei Yisroel (all the tribes of Israel)."
Zecharyah,9,2,"And Chamat at its border; Tzor and Tzidon, though it be very wise."
Zecharyah,9,3,"And Tzor did build herself a matzor (stronghold) , and heaped up kesef like the dust, and fine gold like the mire of the streets."
Zecharyah,9,4,"Hinei, Adonoi will cause it to be taken, and He will strike her power on the yam; and she shall be devoured with eish."
Zecharyah,9,5,"Ashkelon shall see it, and fear; Azah (Gaza) also shall see it, and tremble greatly, and Ekron; for her hope shall be put to shame; and Melech shall perish out of Azah (Gaza) , and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited."
Zecharyah,9,6,"And mamzer shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the ga'on (pride) of the Pelishtim (Philistines)."
Zecharyah,9,7,"And I will take away his dahm out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth; but he will also remain to Eloheinu, and he shall be as a tribe prince in Yehudah, and Ekron like the Yevusi (Jebusite)."
Zecharyah,9,8,"And I will encamp about Mine Bais against military power, because of him that goes maurading to and fro; and no oppressor shall pass through them any more; for now I am keeping watch with Mine eyes."
Zecharyah,9,9,"Rejoice greatly, O Bat Tziyon; shout, O Bat Yerushalayim; hinei, thy Melech cometh unto thee, tzaddik, and having Salvation; ani (lowly, meek) , and riding upon a chamor, even upon a colt the foal of a donkey."
Zecharyah,9,10,"And I will cut off the chariot from Ephrayim, and the war horse from Yerushalayim, and the battle bow shall be cut off. He shall proclaim shalom unto the Goyim; and His dominion shall be from yam even to yam, and from the River even to the ends of ha'aretz."
Zecharyah,9,11,"As for thee also, by the dahm of thy Brit I release thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no mayim."
Zecharyah,9,12,"Return to the stronghold, ye prisoners of tikvah (hope) ; even today do I proclaim that I will repay double unto thee;"
Zecharyah,9,13,"I will bend Yehudah as I bend My keshet (bow) , fill it with Ephrayim, and I will rouse thy banim, O Tziyon, against thy banim, O Yavan (Greece) , and make thee like the cherev (sword) of a gibbor (mighty man)."
Zecharyah,9,14,"And Hashem shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning; and Adonoi Hashem shall sound the shofar, and shall march forth with storms of the south."
Zecharyah,9,15," Hashem Tzva'os shall shield them; and they shall devour, and subdue with sling stones; and they shall drink, and shall roar as through yayin; and they shall be full like a bowl, like the corners of the mizbe'ach."
Zecharyah,9,16,"And Hashem Eloheihem shall save them in Yom HaHu as the tzon of His people; for they shall be as the jewels of a crown, sparkling in His land."
Zecharyah,9,17,"For how great is its goodness, and how great is its beauty! Grain shall make the bochurim thrive, and tirosh, the betulot."
Zecharyah,10,1,"Ask ye of Hashem rain in the time of the latter rain; from Hashem who makes the storm clouds, and gives them showers of rain, to every one esev in the sadeh."
Zecharyah,10,2,"For the terafim (idols) have spoken aven (deceit, nothing) , and the diviners envision sheker, and have told false chalomot (dreams) ; hevel is their comfort; therefore the people wander like sheep, oppressed for lack of a ro'eh (shepherd)."
Zecharyah,10,3,"Mine anger was kindled against the ro'im (shepherds) , and I punished the attudim (he-goats, leaders) ; for Hashem Tzva'os hath visited His eder (flock) , Bais Yehudah, and hath made them like His majestic war horse."
Zecharyah,10,4,"From him will come forth the Pinnah (Cornerstone), from him, the Yated (Tent Peg), from him, the Keshet Milchamah (battle bow), from him every ruler."
Zecharyah,10,5,"Together they shall be like gibborim, which tread down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the milchamah; and they shall fight, because Hashem is with them, and they shall overthrow the riders on susim."
Zecharyah,10,6,"And I will strengthen the Bais Yehudah, and I will save the Bais Yosef, and I will restore them; for I have rachamim upon them; and they shall be as though I had not rejected them; for I am Hashem Eloheihem, and I will answer them."
Zecharyah,10,7,"And they of Ephrayim shall be like a gibbor (mighty man) , and their lev shall have simcha as through yayin; yea, their banim shall see, and have simcha, and their lev shall rejoice in Hashem."
Zecharyah,10,8,"I will whistle for them, and I will gather them in; for I have redeemed them; and they shall multiply as they have multiplied."
Zecharyah,10,9,"And I will sow them among the peoples; and they shall remember Me in far countries; and they shall survive and live with their banim, and they will return."
Zecharyah,10,10,"I will bring them back again also out of Eretz Mitzrayim, and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the Eretz Gil'ad and Levanon; until no more room shall be found for them."
Zecharyah,10,11,"And He shall pass through the yam of tzarah, and shall strike the waves in the yam, and all the depths of the Nile shall dry up; and the ga'on (pride) of Assyria shall be cast down, and the shevet (scepter) of Mitzrayim shall depart."
Zecharyah,10,12,"And I will strengthen them in Hashem ; and they shall walk in Shmo (His Name) , saith Hashem."
Zecharyah,11,1,"Open thy delatot (gates) , O Levanon, that the eish (fire) may devour thy cedars."
Zecharyah,11,2,"Wail, O cypress, for the cedar is fallen; the mighty is despoiled; wail, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the dense forest is toppled."
Zecharyah,11,3,Hear the sound of the wailing of the ro'im (shepherds) ; for their glory is destroyed; the sound of the roaring of young lions; for the ga'on of the Yarden (Jordan) is laid waste.
Zecharyah,11,4,Thus Hashem Elohai said: Shepherd the tzon haharegah (the flock marked for slaughter);
Zecharyah,11,5,"Whose buyers slaughter them, and hold themselves not guilty; and they that sell them say, Baruch Hashem , I have become rich! And their own ro'im (shepherds) spare them not."
Zecharyah,11,6,"Nor will I any more pity the yoshvei ha'aretz (the inhabitants of the land) , saith Hashem ; and hinei, I will deliver the men every one into his neighborʼs hand, and into the power of his melech; and they shall strike ha'aretz, and out of their hand I will not deliver them."
Zecharyah,11,7,"So I did shepherd the tzon haharegah (the flock marked for slaughter) , even aniyei hatzon (the poor of the flock) . And I took unto me two maklot (staffs) ; the one I called No'am (gracious care) , and the other I called Chovelim (bindings); and I did shepherd the tzon (flock)."
Zecharyah,11,8,"Shloshet haro'im (three of the shepherds) also I disposed of in one month; and my nefesh wearied of them, and their nefesh also abhorred me."
Zecharyah,11,9,"Then said I, I will not shepherd you; that which dieth, let it die; and that which is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let those that are left eat every one the basar of another."
Zecharyah,11,10,"And I took my staff, even No'am, and I broke it asunder, breaking off my Brit (covenant) which I had made with kol ha'amim (all the peoples)."
Zecharyah,11,11,"And it was broken on that day; and so the aniyei hatzon (poor of the flock) , who were the shomrim giving heed to me, perceived that this was the Devar Hashem."
Zecharyah,11,12,"And I said unto them, If ye think tov, give me my sachar (price) ; and if not, refrain. So they weighed out for my sachar (price) shloshim kesef (thirty pieces of silver)."
Zecharyah,11,13,"And Hashem said unto me, Throw it unto the yotzer (potter) ; the magnificent price that I was priced of them. So I took the shloshim hakesef, and threw them to the yotzer (potter) in the Beis Hashem."
Zecharyah,11,14,"Then I broke my second staff, called Chovelim, breaking off the achavah (brotherhood) between Yehudah and Yisroel."
Zecharyah,11,15,"And Hashem said unto me, Take unto thee yet the keli (implements) of a foolish ro'eh (shepherd)."
Zecharyah,11,16,"For, hinei, I will raise up a ro'eh in ha'aretz, which shall not care for the dying, nor look for the na'ar (young one) , nor heal that which is injured, nor feed the healthy; but he shall eat the basar of the choice, and tear off their hooves."
Zecharyah,11,17,"Hoy (woe) to the worthless ro'eh (shepherd) that deserteth the tzon! May the cherev (sword) be upon his zero'a (arm) , and upon his right eye; let his zero'a wither away, and his right eye be utterly extinguished."
Zecharyah,12,1,"The burden of the Devar Hashem concerning Yisroel, saith Hashem , who stretcheth forth Shomayim, and layeth the yesod aretz, and formeth the ruach adam within him."
Zecharyah,12,2,"Hinei, I will make Yerushalayim a cup of reeling unto kol ha'amim (all the peoples) round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Yehudah and against Yerushalayim."
Zecharyah,12,3,"And on Yom HaHu will I make Yerushalayim an even ma'amasah (a burdensome stone) for kol ha'amim: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though kol Goyei Ha'Aretz be gathered together against her."
Zecharyah,12,4,"In Yom HaHu, saith Hashem , I will strike every sus with panic, and his rider with madness; and I will open mine eyes upon the Bais Yehudah, and will strike every sus of the people with blindness."
Zecharyah,12,5,"And the Aluphei Yehudah (leaders of Yehudah) shall say in their lev, The yoshvei Yerushalayim are my strength in Hashem Tzva'os Eloheihem."
Zecharyah,12,6,"In Yom HaHu will I make the Aluphei Yehudah like a fire pot in the woods, and like a torch of eish in the omer (sheaves) ; and they shall devour kol haAm round about, on the right hand and on the left; and Yerushalayim shall be inhabited again in her own site, even in Yerushalayim."
Zecharyah,12,7," Hashem also shall save the oholei Yehudah (tents of Yehudah) first, that the glory of the Bais Dovid and the glory of the inhabitants of Yerushalayim do not magnify themselves against Yehudah."
Zecharyah,12,8,"In Yom Hahu shall Hashem defend the inhabitants of Yerushalayim; and he that is feeble among them in Yom Hahu shall be like Dovid; and the Bais Dovid shall be like Elohim, like the Malach Hashem before them."
Zecharyah,12,9,"And it shall come to pass in Yom Hahu, that I will seek to destroy kol HaGoyim that attack Yerushalayim."
Zecharyah,12,10,"And I will pour upon the Bais Dovid, and upon the inhabitants of Yerushalayim, the Ruach (Spirit) of Chen (grace) and of Tachanunim (supplications for favor) ; and they shall look upon Me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for Him (Moshiach) as one mourneth for his yachid (only son) , and shall grieve in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his bechor (firstborn)."
Zecharyah,12,11,"In Yom Hahu shall there be a great mourning in Yerushalayim, as the mourning of Hadad-Rimmon in the valley of Megiddo."
Zecharyah,12,12,"And ha'aretz shall mourn, all mishpochot apart; the mishpachat Bais Dovid apart, and their wives apart; the mishpachat Bais Natan apart, and their wives apart;"
Zecharyah,12,13,"The mishpachat Bais Levi apart, and their wives apart; the mishpachat Shime'i apart, and their wives apart;"
Zecharyah,12,14,"All the mishpochot that remain, all mishpochot apart, and their wives apart."
Zecharyah,13,1,In Yom HaHu there shall be a makor (fountain) opened to the Bais Dovid and to the inhabitants of Yerushalayim for sin and for niddah (impurity).
Zecharyah,13,2,"And in Yom HaHu it shall come to pass, saith Hashem Tzva'os, that I will cut off the shmot (names) of the atzabim (idols) out of ha'aretz, and they shall no more be remembered; and also I will cause the nevi'im and the ruach hatum'ah (unclean spirit) to pass from ha'aretz."
Zecharyah,13,3,"And it shall come to pass, that if any shall still prophesy, then his av and his em that bore him shall say unto him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest sheker b'Shem Hashem ; and his av and his em that bore him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth."
Zecharyah,13,4,"And in Yom HaHu it shall come to pass, that the nevi'im shall be ashamed, every one of his chizzayon (vision, revelation) , when he hath prophesied; neither shall they wear an adderet se'ar (garment of hair, hairy mantle) to deceive;"
Zecharyah,13,5,"But he shall say, I am no navi, I am an ish oved adamah (a man who works the soil) ; for land I owned from my youth."
Zecharyah,13,6,"And if one shall say unto him, What are these makkot (strokes, marks of strokes, scars, wounds) between thine hands? Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the bais of my friends."
Zecharyah,13,7,"Awake, O Cherev (sword) , against My Ro'eh, against the Gever (man) that is My Amit (fellow, intimate companion, associate) , saith Hashem Tzva'os; strike the Ro'eh (shepherd) , and the Tzon (sheep, flock) shall be scattered; and I will turn Mine hand upon the tzo'arim (little ones);"
Zecharyah,13,8,"And it shall come to pass, that in kol ha'aretz, saith Hashem , two-thirds therein shall be cut off and die; but one-third shall remain therein."
Zecharyah,13,9,"And I will bring the one-third through the eish, and will refine them as kesef is refined, and will test them as zahav is tested; they shall call biShmi (on My Name) , and I will hear them; I will say, This is My people; and they shall say, Hashem is Elohai."
Zecharyah,14,1,"Hinei, a day cometh for Hashem , when the plunder taken from thee shall among thee be divided."
Zecharyah,14,2,"For I will gather kol HaGoyim against Yerushalayim for milchamah (battle, war) ; and HaIr (the city, Yerushalayim) shall be taken, and the batim (houses) plundered, and the women ravished; and half of HaIr shall go forth into the Golus (exile) , and the rest of the people shall not be cut off from HaIr."
Zecharyah,14,3,"Then shall Hashem go forth, and fight against those Goyim, as He fights in the Yom Krav (day of battle)."
Zecharyah,14,4,"And in Yom HaHu, His raglayim (feet) shall stand upon the Mount of Olives, which is east of Yerushalayim, and the Mount of Olives shall be split in two from east to west by a gey gedolah me'od (a very great valley) , with half of the mountain moving to the north, and half of it to the south."
Zecharyah,14,5,"And ye shall flee to the gey (valley) in the mountains; for the gey (valley) of the harim (mountains) shall extend unto Atzel; yea, ye shall flee, just as ye fled from before the ra'ash (earthquake) in the days of Uziyah Melech Yehudah; and Hashem Elohai shall come, and kol Kedoshim (all the holy ones) with Thee."
Zecharyah,14,6,"And it shall come to pass in Yom HaHu, that there shall no longer be cold or frost:"
Zecharyah,14,7,"But it shall be Yom Echad, known to Hashem , with no Yom, nor Lailah; but it shall come to pass, that at erev it shall be ohr."
Zecharyah,14,8,"And it shall be in Yom HaHu, that mayim chayyim (living waters) shall go out from Yerushalayim; half toward the eastern sea, and half toward the western sea; in kayitz (summer) and in khoref (winter) shall it be."
Zecharyah,14,9,"And Hashem shall be Melech Al Kol HaAretz (King over all the earth) ; in Yom HaHu (in that day) shall Hashem be echad, and Shmo Echad."
Zecharyah,14,10,"And kol ha'aretz shall be made like the Aravah from Geva to Rimmon in the Negev. Yerushalayim shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from Sha'ar Binyamin unto the place of the Sha'ar Harishon (the first gate) , unto the Corner Gate; and from the Migdal Chanan'el unto the kingʼs wine presses."
Zecharyah,14,11,"And men shall inhabit her, and there shall be no more cherem (utter destruction, holy war) ; but Yerushalayim shall be inhabited labetach (in confidence, security)."
Zecharyah,14,12,"And this shall be the magefah (plague) wherewith Hashem will strike kol ha'amim (all the peoples) that have fought against Yerushalayim; their basar shall rot while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall rot in their sockets, and their tongue shall rot in their mouth."
Zecharyah,14,13,"And in Yom HaHu it shall come to pass, that there shall be among them a mehumat Hashem (a panic from Hashem) , and they shall seize every one the hand of his neighbor, and the hand of each shall rise up against the hand of his neighbor."
Zecharyah,14,14,"And Yehudah also shall fight at Yerushalayim; and the wealth of kol HaGoyim round about shall be gathered together, zahav, and kesef, and apparel, in great abundance."
Zecharyah,14,15,"And so shall be the magefat hasus (plague on the horse) , on the mule, on the camel, and on the donkey, and on all the beasts that shall be in those camps, like this magefah (plague)."
Zecharyah,14,16,"And it shall come to pass, that all who are left of kol HaGoyim which came against Yerushalayim shall even go up from year to year to worship HaMelech, Hashem Tzva'os, and to keep Chag HaSukkot."
Zecharyah,14,17,"And it shall be, that whosoever will not make this aliyah from the mishpekhot ha'aretz unto Yerushalayim to worship HaMelech, Hashem Tzva'os, even upon them shall be no geshem (rain)."
Zecharyah,14,18,"And if the mishpakhat Mitzrayim go not up, and come not, upon them shall fall the magefah (plague) wherewith Hashem will strike the Goyim that come not up to keep Chag HaSukkot."
Zecharyah,14,19,"This shall be the punishment of Mitzrayim, and the punishment of kol HaGoyim that come not up to keep Chag HaSukkot."
Zecharyah,14,20,"In Yom HaHu shall there be upon the metzillot (bells) of the susim, KODESH L'HASHEM; and the sirot (cooking pots) in the Beis Hashem shall be like the mizrakim (libation bowls) before the mizbe'ach."
Zecharyah,14,21,"Yea, every siyr (pot) in Yerushalayim and in Yehudah shall be KODESH L'HASHEM TZVA'OS: and all the zovechim (the ones sacrificing) shall come and take of them, and they shall cook in them; and in Yom HaHu there shall be no more Kena'ani (Canaanite, merchant) in the Beis Hashem Tzva'os."
