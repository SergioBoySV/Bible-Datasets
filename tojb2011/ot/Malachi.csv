Malachi,1,1,The burden of the Devar Hashem to Yisroel by Malachi.
Malachi,1,2,"I have loved you, saith Hashem . Yet ye say, Wherein hast Thou loved us? Was not Esav Ya'akovʼs brother? saith Hashem ; yet I loved Ya'akov,"
Malachi,1,3,"But I hated Esav, and his mountains and his nachalah I laid waste into wasteland for the jackals of the midbar."
Malachi,1,4,"Whereas Edom saith, We are dashed to pieces, but we will return and rebuild the ruins; thus saith Hashem Tzva'os: They may build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, Gevul Rishah (territory of wickedness) , and the people against whom Hashem hath indignation ad olam (for ever)."
Malachi,1,5,"And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, Hashem is gadol (great) even beyond the Gevul Yisroel."
Malachi,1,6,"A ben honoreth his av, and an eved his adon; if then I be an Av, where is Mine honor? And if I be Adonim, where is My reverence? saith Hashem Tzva'os unto you, O kohanim, that despise My Name. But ye say, Wherein have we despised Thy name?"
Malachi,1,7,"Ye offer lechem mego'al (defiled food) upon Mine mizbe'ach; and ye say, Wherein have we defiled Thee? In that ye say, The shulchan of Hashem is to be despised."
Malachi,1,8,"And when ye offer the blind animal for sacrifice, is it not rah? And when ye offer the lame and diseased, is it not rah? Offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or receive thee? saith Hashem Tzva'os."
Malachi,1,9,"And now, I pray you, beseech G-d that He will be gracious unto us; with such offerings from your hand, will He receive you? saith Hashem Tzva'os."
Malachi,1,10,"Who is there even among you that would shut the dlatayim of the Beis Hamikdash so that eish would not be kindled on Mine mizbe'ach in vain? There is no chefetz (pleasure) to Me with you, saith Hashem Tzva'os, neither will I accept a minchah at your hand."
Malachi,1,11,"For from the rising of the shemesh even unto the going down of the same My name shall be gadol among the Goyim; and in every place incense shall be offered unto My name, and a minchah tehorah; for My name shall be gadol among the Goyim, saith Hashem Tzva'os."
Malachi,1,12,"But ye have committed chillul Hashem (desecration of the Name) , in that ye say, The shulchan Adonoi is mego'al (defiled) ; and the fruit, even the food thereof, is contemptible."
Malachi,1,13,"Ye said also, Hinei, what a burden it is! And ye have sniffed scornfully at it, saith Hashem Tzva'os; and ye brought that which was injured, and the lame, and the diseased; thus ye brought a minchah; should I accept this of your hand? saith Hashem."
Malachi,1,14,"But cursed be the nokhel (cheat, swindler, charlatan) , which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto Hashem the one being blemished; for I am a Melech Gadol, saith Hashem Tzva'os, and My name is to be feared among the Goyim."
Malachi,2,1,"And now, O ye kohanim, this mitzvah is for you."
Malachi,2,2,"If ye will not hear, and if ye will not take it to lev, to give kavod unto My name, saith Hashem Tzva'os, I will even send a me'erah (curse) upon you, and I will curse your brakhot; yea, I have cursed them already, because ye do not take it to lev."
Malachi,2,3,"Hineni, I am rebuking your zera, and I will spread dung upon your faces, even the dung of your chagim; and it will take you away with it."
Malachi,2,4,"And ye shall have da'as that I have sent this mitzvah unto you, that My brit might continue with Levi, saith Hashem Tzva'os."
Malachi,2,5,"My brit was with him of chayyim and shalom; and I gave them to him that he might fear Me; so he feared Me, and stood in reverence before My name."
Malachi,2,6,"Torat emes was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found on his lips: he walked with Me in shalom and yashrus, and did turn rabbim (many) away from avon (iniquity)."
Malachi,2,7,"For the kohenʼs lips should preserve da'as, and they should seek torah at his mouth: for he is the malach Hashem Tzva'os."
Malachi,2,8,But ye are departed out of HaDerech; ye have caused rabbim to fall into a michshol (stumbling block) at the torah (teaching) ; ye have corrupted the Brit of Levi saith Hashem Tzva'os.
Malachi,2,9,"Therefore have I also made you contemptible and shefalim before kol HaAm because ye have not been shomrim of darkhei of Me, but have shown partiality in torah."
Malachi,2,10,Have we not all Av Echad? Hath not El Echad created us? Why do we commit chillul Brit Avoteinu by every man breaking faith with his brother?
Malachi,2,11,"Yehudah hath broken faith, and a toeva (abomination) is committed in Yisroel and in Yerushalayim; for Yehudah hath committed chillul against the Beis Hamikdash Hashem loves, by marrying the bat el nekhar."
Malachi,2,12,"May Hashem cut off the man that doeth this, [offspring] awake and answering, from the ohalim of Ya'akov, that offereth a minchah unto Hashem Tzva'os."
Malachi,2,13,"And this too have ye done, covering the mizbe'ach of Hashem with tears, with weeping, and with crying out, because that He regardeth not the minchah any more, nor receiveth it with ratzon (good will) at your hand."
Malachi,2,14,"Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because Hashem hath been ed (witness) between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously, breaking faith: yet is she thy chaveret, and the wife of thy brit."
Malachi,2,15,"And did not Hashem make echad? And the remnant of the ruach is Hashem ʼs. And why echad? That He might seek zera Elohim. Therefore be shomer of your ruach, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth."
Malachi,2,16,"For Hashem Elohei Yisroel saith that He hateth putting away: for it covereth oneʼs garment with chamas (violence) , saith the Hashem Tzva'os: therefore, be shomer of your ruach, that ye deal not treacherously, breaking faith."
Malachi,2,17,"Ye have wearied Hashem with your devarim. Yet ye say, Wherein have we wearied Him? When ye say, Everyone that doeth rah is tov in the sight of Hashem , and in them Hashem finds chafetz; or, Where is Elohei HaMishpat?"
Malachi,3,1,"Hineni, I will send malachi, and he shall prepare the Derech before me: and HaAdon (the L-rd) [Moshiach], whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to His Heikhal, even the Malach HaBrit, in whom ye have chafetz (delight) : hinei, He is coming, saith Hashem Tzva'os."
Malachi,3,2,"But who may abide the Yom Bo'o (day of His coming) ? Who shall stand when He appeareth? For He is like a refinerʼs eish, and like fullersʼ soap:"
Malachi,3,3,"And He shall sit as a refiner and purifier of kesef; and He shall purify the Bnei Levi, and purge them as zahav and kesef, that they may offer unto Hashem an offering in tzedakah."
Malachi,3,4,"Then shall the offering of Yehudah and Yerushalayim be pleasing unto Hashem , as in the yamei olam (days of old) , and as in shanim kadmoniyyot (former years)."
Malachi,3,5,"And I will come near to you for mishpat; and I will be a swift ed (witness) against the mekhashfim (sorcerers) , and against the mena'afim (adulterers) , and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the almanah (widow) , and the fatherless, and that turn aside the ger from his right, and fear not Me, saith Hashem Tzva'os."
Malachi,3,6,"For I am Hashem , I change not; therefore ye Bnei Ya'akov are not consumed."
Malachi,3,7,"Even from the yamei avoteichem ye are gone away from Mine chukkim, and have not been shomer over them. Return unto Me, and I will return unto you, saith Hashem Tzva'os. But ye said, Wherein shall we return?"
Malachi,3,8,"Will a man rob G-d? Yet ye have robbed Me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed Thee? In ma'aser (tithes) and terumah (offerings, contributions)."
Malachi,3,9,"Ye are cursed with a me'erah (curse) ; for ye have robbed Me, even this whole Goy (nation)."
Malachi,3,10,"Bring ye kol hama'aser (all the tithes) into the Beis HaOtzar (House of the Treasury) , that there may be teref (food) in Mine Beis, and prove Me now herewith, saith Hashem Tzva'os, if I will not open you the windows of Shomayim, and pour you out a brocha, that there shall not be room enough to receive it."
Malachi,3,11,"And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the p'ri ha'adamah; neither shall your gefen cast her fruit before the time in the sadeh, saith Hashem Tzva'os."
Malachi,3,12,"And kol HaGoyim shall call you blessed; for ye shall be an Eretz Chefetz, saith Hashem Tzva'os."
Malachi,3,13,"Your devarim have been harsh against Me, saith Hashem . Yet ye say, What have we spoken so much against Thee?"
Malachi,3,14,"Ye have said, Avod Elohim is vain; and what profit is it that we have been shomer over His mishmeret, and that we have walked as mourners before Hashem Tzva'os?"
Malachi,3,15,"And now we call the zedim (proud) happy; yea, they that work rishah (wickedness) are set up; yea, they that tempt Elohim even go free."
Malachi,3,16,"Then they that feared Hashem spoke often one to another; and Hashem paid heed, and heard it, and a Sefer Zikaron (book of remembrance) was written before Him for them that feared Hashem , and that meditated upon Shmo (His Name)."
Malachi,3,17,"And they shall be Mine, saith Hashem Tzva'os, in that Yom when I make up My segullah (special treasure, possession) ; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own ben haoved oto (son that serveth him)."
Malachi,3,18,"Then shall ye return, and discern between the tzaddik and the rasha, between oved Elohim (him that serveth G-d) and him that serveth Him not."
Malachi,4,1,"For, hinei, HaYom bah (the day cometh) , that shall burn as an oven; and kol zedim (all the proud) , yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble; and HaYom that cometh shall burn them up, saith Hashem Tzva'os, that it shall leave them neither shoresh (root) nor anaf (branch)."
Malachi,4,2,"But unto you that fear My name shall the Shemesh Tzedakah (sun of righteousness) arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall."
Malachi,4,3,"And ye shall trample down the resha'im; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in HaYom that I shall do this, saith Hashem Tzva'os."
Malachi,4,4,"Remember ye the Torat Moshe Avdi, which I commanded unto him in Chorev for kol Yisroel, with the chukkim (statutes) and mishpatim (judgments)."
Malachi,4,5,"Hinei, I will send you Eliyahu HaNavi before the coming of the great and dreadful Yom Hashem;"
Malachi,4,6,"And he shall turn the lev-avot to the banim, and the lev-banim to their avot, lest I come and strike the earth with cherem."
