Divrey Hayamim Alef,9,14,And of the Levi'im: Shema'yah Ben Chashuv Ben Azrikam Ben Chashavyah of the Bnei Merari;
Divrey Hayamim Alef,9,15,"And Bakbakkar, Cheresh, Galal, and Matanyah Ben Micha Ben Zichri Ben Asaph;"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,9,16,"And Ovadyah Ben Shema'yah Ben Galal Ben Yedutun, and Berechyah Ben Asa Ben Elkanah, that dwelt in the villages of the Netophati."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,9,17,"And the sho'arim were Shallum, Akkuv, Talmon, Achiman, and their brethren; Shallum was HaRosh,"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,9,18,Who up to now had been stationed at Sha'ar HaMelech eastward; they were sho'arim in the machanot Bnei Levi.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,9,19,"And Shallum Ben Kore Ben Evyasaph Ben Korach and his brethren of the bais aviv, the Korchim, were over the work of the avodah, shomrei hasapim laOhel (keepers of the thresholds of the Tent); and avoteihem, being over the Machaneh Hashem , were shomrim of the entrance."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,9,20,"And Pinchas Ben El'azar was nagid over them in time past, and Hashem was with him."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,9,21,"And Zecharyah Ben Meshelemyah was sho'er (doorkeeper, gatekeeper) of the Petach of the Ohel Mo'ed."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,9,22,"All these which were haberurim (the ones being chosen) to be sho'arim (gatekeepers) in the sapim (thresholds) were 212. These were reckoned by their genealogy in their villages, whom Dovid and Shmuel the Ro'eh (seer) did assign in their emunah (set office, entrusted responsibility)."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,9,23,"So they and their banim had the oversight of the she'arim (gates) of the Beis Hashem , namely, the Beis HaOhel, by mishmarot (shifts, watches)."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,9,24,"In four quarters were the sho'arim, toward the east, west, north, and south."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,9,25,"And their brethren, which were in their villages, were to come after shivat hayamim from time to time with them."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,9,26,"For these Levi'im, the four gibborei hasho'arim, were in their emunah (set office, entrusted responsibility) , and were over the rooms and otzarot (treasuries) of the Bais HaElohim."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,9,27,"And they spent the night around the Bais HaElohim, because the mishmeret was upon them; they were responsible for the mafte'ach (key) thereof laboker laboker."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,9,28,"And certain of them had the charge of the kelim (vessels) of the avodah (service, ministry) , that they should bring them in and out by inventory count."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,9,29,"Some of them also were appointed to oversee the kelim (vessels) , and all the k'lei haKodesh, and the solet (flour) , and the yayin, and the shemen, and the incense, and the spices."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,9,30,And some of the Bnei HaKohanim mixed the blending of the spices.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,9,31,"And Mattityah, one of the Levi'im, who was the bechor of Shallum the Korchi, had the emunah (set office, entrusted responsibility) over the things that were made in hachavitim (panbaking)."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,9,32,"And other of their brethren, of the Bnei HaKehati, were over the Lechem HaMaarechet (Bread of Array, Showbread) , to prepare it Shabbos Shabbos."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,9,33,"And these are the meshorerim (singers) , family heads of the Levi'im, who remained in the Peturim Chambers; for they were employed in that work yomam valailah."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,9,34,These family heads of the Levi'im were heads throughout their toldot; these dwelt at Yerushalayim.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,9,35,"And in Giv'on dwelt the avi Giv'on, Ye'iel, the shem of whose isha was Ma'achah,"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,9,36,"And his bechor Avdon, then Tzur, and Kish, and Ba'al, and Ner, and Nadav."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,9,37,"And Gedor, and Achyo, and Zecharyah, and Miklot."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,9,38,And Miklot fathered Shim'am. And they also dwelt near their brethren at Yerushalayim with their brethren.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,9,39,"And Ner fathered Kish; and Kish fathered Sha'ul; and Sha'ul fathered Yonatan, and Malki-Shu'a, and Avinadav, and Eshba'al."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,9,40,And the Ben Yonatan was Meriv-Ba'al; and Meriv-Ba'al fathered Michah.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,9,41,"And the Bnei Michah were Piton, and Melech, and Tachre'a."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,9,42,"And Achaz fathered Yarah; and Yarah fathered Alemet, and Azmavet, and Zimri; and Zimri fathered Motza;"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,9,43,"And Motza fathered Bine'a; and Refayah bno, El'asah bno, Atzel bno."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,9,44,"And Atzel had six banim, whose shmot are these; Azrikam, Bocheru, and Yishmael, and She'aryah, and Ovadyah, and Chanan; these were the Bnei Atzel."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,10,1,"Now the Pelishtim (Philistines) fought against Yisroel; and the men of Yisroel fled from before the Pelishtim, and fell down chalalim (slain ones) on Mt Gilboa."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,10,2,"And the Pelishtim followed hard after Sha'ul, and after his banim; and the Pelishtim slaughtered Yonatan, and Avinadav, and Malki-Shu'a, the Bnei Sha'ul."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,10,3,"And the milchamah became intense against Sha'ul, and the archers overtook him, and he was wounded by the archers."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,10,4,"Then said Sha'ul to his noseh keli (armor bearer) , Draw thy cherev, and thrust me through therewith; lest these arelim (uncircumcised ones) come and abuse me. But his noseh keli would not; for he was very afraid. So Sha'ul took a cherev, and fell upon it."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,10,5,"And when his noseh keli saw that Sha'ul was dead, he fell likewise on the cherev, and died."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,10,6,"So Sha'ul died, and his shloshet banim, and all his Bais died together."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,10,7,"And when kol Ish Yisroel that were in the emek (valley) saw that they fled, and that Sha'ul and his banim were dead, then they abandoned their towns, and fled; and the Pelishtim came and took occupation of them."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,10,8,"And it came to pass on the next day, when the Pelishtim came to strip the chalalim, that they found Sha'ul and his banim fallen on Mt Gilboa."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,10,9,"And when they had stripped him, they took his rosh (head) , and his keli (armor) , and sent into eretz Pelishtim all around, to carry the news unto their atzabim, and to the people."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,10,10,"And they put his keli in the Bais eloheihem, and fastened his head in the Bais Dagon."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,10,11,"And when kol Yavesh-Gil'ad heard all that the Pelishtim had done to Sha'ul,"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,10,12,"They arose, kol ish chayil, and took the gufat Sha'ul (body of Sha'ul) , and the gufot of his banim, and brought them to Yavesh, and buried their atzmot under the elah (oak tree) in Yavesh, and underwent a tzom shivat yamim."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,10,13,"So Sha'ul died for his ma'al (unfaithfulness) which he committed against Hashem , even against the Devar Hashem , over which he was not shomer, and also for consulting an ov (one with a familiar spirit) to seek guidance;"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,10,14,"And inquired not of Hashem ; therefore He slaughtered him, and turned over the kingdom unto Dovid Ben Yishai."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,11,1,"Then kol Yisroel gathered themselves to Dovid unto Chevron, saying, Hinei, we are thy etzem (bone) and thy basar."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,11,2,"And moreover in time past, even when Sha'ul was melech, thou wast he that hamotzi (led out) and brought in Yisroel; and Hashem Eloheicha said unto thee, Thou shalt shepherd My people Yisroel, and thou shalt be Nagid over My people Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,11,3,"Therefore came all the Ziknei Yisroel to HaMelech to Chevron; and Dovid cut a Brit with them in Chevron before Hashem ; and vayimeshechu (they anointed) Dovid Melech over Yisroel, according to the Devar Hashem by Shmuel."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,11,4,"And Dovid and Kol Yisroel went to Yerushalayim, which is Yevus; where the Yevusi were, the inhabitants of ha'aretz."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,11,5,"And the inhabitants of Yevus said to Dovid, Thou shalt not come in here. Nevertheless Dovid took the Metzudat Tziyon, which is Ir Dovid."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,11,6,"And Dovid said, Whosoever attacketh the Yevusi barishonah shall be Rosh and Sar. So Yoav Ben Tzeruyah went up first, and became Rosh."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,11,7,And Dovid dwelt in the Metzad; therefore they called it Ir Dovid.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,11,8,"And he built the Ir around it, even from the Millo to the surrounding area, and Yoav repaired the rest of the Ir."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,11,9,"So Dovid continued greater and greater, for Hashem Tzva'os was with him."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,11,10,"These also are the Roshei HaGibborim whom Dovid had, who strengthened themselves with him in his Malchut, and with all Yisroel, to make him Melech, according to the Devar Hashem concerning Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,11,11,"And this is the mispar (number) of the Gibborim whom Dovid had: Yashov'am, a ben Chachmoni, Rosh HaShaloshim: he lifted up his khanit against shlosh me'ot slain by him at one time."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,11,12,"And after him was El'azar Ben Dodo, the Achochi, who was one of the Shloshah HaGibborim."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,11,13,"He was with Dovid at Pas Dammim, and there the Pelishtim (Philistines) were gathered together to battle, where was chelekat hasadeh (a parcel of ground) full of se'orim (barley) ; and HaAm (the people, troops, army) fled from before the Pelishtim (Philistines)."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,11,14,"And they set themselves in the midst of that chelekah (parcel) , and delivered it, and slaughtered the Pelishtim (Philistines) ; vayosha Hashem (and Hashem saved) them by a teshu'ah gedolah (great deliverance)."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,11,15,"Now three of the sheloshim rosh went down to the Tzur to Dovid, into the me'arah (cave) of Adullam; and the machaneh of the Pelishtim (Philistines) encamped in the Emek Repha'im."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,11,16,"And Dovid was then in the Metzudah, and the garrison of the Pelishtim was then at Beit-Lechem."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,11,17,"And Dovid had a [thirsty] longing, and said, Oh that one would draw for me drink of the mayim from the bor (well) of Beit-Lechem, that is at the sha'ar (gate)."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,11,18,"And the Shlosha broke through the machaneh Pelishtim (Philistines) , and drew mayim out of the bor Beit-Lechem, that was by the sha'ar, and took it, and brought it to Dovid; but Dovid would not drink of it, but poured it out to Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,11,19,"And said, Chalilah li meElohai (Elohai forbid it me) , that I should do this thing. Shall I drink the dahm of these anashim at their nafshot? For at jeopardy of their nafshot they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these Shloshet HaGibborim."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,11,20,"And Avishai the brother of Yoav, he was Rosh HaSheloshah; for lifting up his khanit against Shlosh Me'ot, he slaughtered them, and had a shem among the Shloshah."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,11,21,"Of the Shloshah, he was more honored than the two; for he was their Sar; howbeit he attained not to the Shloshah."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,11,22,"Benayah Ben Yehoyada, a valiant man of Kavtze'el, who had done many exploits; he slaughtered two lion-like men of Moav; also he went down and slaughtered an ari in a bor (pit) on a yom sheleg (snowy day)."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,11,23,"And he slaughtered the ish HaMitzri, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the yad HaMitzri was a khanit like a rod of an oreg (weaver) ; and he went down to him with a shevet (club) , and plucked the khanit out of the yad HaMitzri, and slaughtered him with his own khanit."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,11,24,"These things did Benayah Ben Yehoyada, and had the shem among the Shloshah HaGibborim."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,11,25,"Behold, he was honored among the Shloshim, but attained not to the Shloshah; and Dovid set him over his mishma'at."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,11,26,"Also the valiant men of the armies were, Asahel the brother of Yoav, Elchanan Ben Dodo of Beit-Lechem,"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,11,27,"Shammot the Harori, Cheletz the Peloni,"

Divrey Hayamim Alef,11,47,"Eliel, Oved, and Ya'asiel the Metzovayah."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,12,1,"Now these are they that came to Dovid to Tziklag, while he was still a fugitive because of Sha'ul Ben Kish; and they were among the gibborim, helpers in milchamah."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,12,2,"They were armed with keshet (bow) , and could use both the right hand and the left in hurling stones and shooting khitzim (arrows) from a keshet; they were kinsmen of Sha'ul, of Binyamin."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,12,3,"The head was Achi'ezer, then Yoash, the Bnei Shema'ah the Giveati; Yeziel, Pelet, the Bnei Azmavet; Berakhah, and Yehu the Anetoti."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,12,4,"And Yishma'yah the Giv'oni, a gibbor among the Shloshim (Thirty) , and over the Shloshim; and Yirmeyah, Yachaziel, Yochanan, and Yozavad the Gederati,"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,12,5,"Eluzai, Yerimot, Bealyah, Shemaryahu, and Shephatyahu the Charuphi,"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,12,6,"Elkanah, Yishiyahu, Azare'el, Yo'ezer, and Yashov'am, the Korchi,"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,12,7,"And Yo'elah, and Zevadyah, the Bnei Yerocham of Gedor."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,12,8,"And of the Gadi there separated themselves unto Dovid into the stronghold in the midbar gibborei hachayil (men of valor) , and anshei tzavah (army men) for milchamah, that could handle shield and spear, whose faces were like the faces of aryeh, and were as swift as the gazelles upon the harim;"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,12,9,"Ezer the head, Ovadyah the second, Eliav the third,"

Divrey Hayamim Alef,12,13,"Yirmeyah the tenth, Makhbanai the eleventh."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,12,14,"These were of the Bnei Gad, commanders of the tzava (army) . One of the least was equal to a hundred, and the greatest to an elef."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,12,15,"These are they that went over Yarden in the first month, when it was overflowing all its banks; they put to flight all them of the valleys, both toward the east, and toward the west."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,12,16,And there came of the Bnei Binyamin and Yehudah to the stronghold unto Dovid.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,12,17,"And Dovid went out before them, and answered and said unto them, If ye be come in shalom unto me to help me, mine lev shall be united unto you, but if ye be come to betray me to mine enemies, seeing there is no chamas in mine hands, Elohei Avoteinu look thereon, and pass judgment."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,12,18,"Then the Ruach came upon Amasai, who was head of the Thirty, and he said, Thine are we, Dovid, and on thy side, thou Ben Yishai. Shalom, shalom be unto thee, and shalom be to thine helpers; for Eloheicha helpeth thee. Then Dovid received them, and made them heads of the gedud (raiding band, troop)."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,12,19,"And there defected some of Menasheh to Dovid, when he went with the Pelishtim (Philistines) against Sha'ul for milchamah, but they helped them not; for the rulers of the Pelishtim after etzah (counsel) sent him away, saying, He will defect to his adon Sha'ul to the jeopardy of our heads."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,12,20,"As he went to Tziklag, there defected to him those of Menasheh, Adnach, and Yozavad, and Yedi'ael, and Micha'el, and Yozavad, and Elihu, and Tzilletai, heads of the alafim that were of Menasheh."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,12,21,"And they helped Dovid against the gedud, for they were all gibborei chayil, and were sarim in the tzava (army)."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,12,22,"For at that time day by day there came men to Dovid to help him, until it was a machaneh gadol, like the Machaneh Elohim."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,12,23,"And these are the numbers of the leaders that were ready-armed for the army, and came to Dovid to Chevron, to turn over the Malchut Sha'ul to him, according to the word of Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,12,24,"The Bnei Yehudah that bore shield and romach (spear) were six alafim and eight hundred, ready-armed for tzva."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,12,25,"Of the Bnei Shim'on, gibborei chayil for tzava, shivat alafim and one hundred."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,12,26,Of the Bnei Levi four alafim and six hundred.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,12,27,"And Yehoyada was the nagid of those of Aharon, and with him were three alafim and sheva hundred;"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,12,28,"And Tzadok, a na'ar gibbor chayil, and of bais aviv twenty and two sarim."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,12,29,"And of the Bnei Binyamin, the kindred of Sha'ul, three alafim; for up until then the greatest part of them had kept shomrim mishmeret Bais Sha'ul (guarded loyalty to the House of Sha'ul)."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,12,30,"And of the Bnei Ephrayim twenty elef and eight hundred, gibborei chayil, famous throughout the bais of their avot."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,12,31,"And of the half tribe of Menasheh eighteen elef, which were designated by shmot, to come and make Dovid Melech."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,12,32,"And of the Bnei Yissakhar, which were men that had binah (understanding) of the times, to know what Yisroel ought to do; the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brethren were under their commandment."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,12,33,"Of Zevulun, such as went forth to tzava (military service) , expert in milchamah, with all instruments of milchamah, fifty elef, which could keep rank; they were not of double heart."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,12,34,"And of Naphtali elef sarim, and with them with shield and khanit (spear) thirty and shivah elef."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,12,35,And of the Dani expert in milchamah twenty and eight elef and six hundred.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,12,36,"And of Asher, such as went forth to tzava (military service) , expert in milchamah, forty elef."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,12,37,"And on the other side of Yarden, of the Reuveni, and the Gadi, and of the half shevet (tribe) of Menasheh, with all manner of instruments of tzava for the milchamah, a hundred and twenty elef."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,12,38,"All these anshei milchamah, that could keep rank, came with a levav shalem to Chevron, to make Dovid Melech over kol Yisroel; and all the rest also of Yisroel were of lev echad to make Dovid Melech."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,12,39,"And there they were with Dovid yamim shloshah, eating and drinking, for their brethren had prepared for them."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,12,40,"Moreover they that were kerovim (near ones, neighbors) to them, even unto Yissakhar and Zevulun and Naphtali, brought lechem on chamorim, and on gemalim (camels) , and on peradim, and on bakar, and food of kemach (flour) , cakes of figs, and raisin cakes, and yayin, and shemen, and bakar, and tzon abundantly; for there was simchah in Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,13,1,"And Dovid consulted with the sarei ha'alafim and me'ot, and with every nagid."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,13,2,"And Dovid said unto kol Kehal Yisroel, If it seem tov unto you, and that it be of Hashem Eloheinu, let us send out everywhere unto acheinu (our brethren) , that remain in kol Aratzot Yisroel, and with them also to the Kohanim and Levi'im which are in their towns and migroshot (adjacent open lands) , that they may gather themselves unto us;"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,13,3,"And let us bring back the Aron Eloheinu to us, for we inquired not of him in the yamim of Sha'ul."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,13,4,"And kol HaKahal said that they would do so, for the thing was yashar in the eyes of kol HaAm."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,13,5,"So Dovid assembled kol Yisroel together, from Shichor in Mitzrayim even unto the entrance of Chamat, to bring the Aron HaElohim from Kiryat-Ye'arim."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,13,6,"And Dovid went up, and kol Yisroel, to Ba'alah, that is, to Kiryat-Ye'arim, which belonged to Yehudah, to bring up from there the Aron HaElohim Hashem , that is enthroned upon the keruvim, that is called by [His] Shem."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,13,7,"And they moved the Aron HaElohim on an agalah chadashah from the bais Avinadav, and Uzza and Achyo guided the agalah."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,13,8,"And Dovid and Kol Yisroel rejoiced before HaElohim with kol oz and with shirim (songs) , and with kinnorot (harps) , and with nevalim (lyres) , and with tambourines, and with cymbals, and with khatzotzerot (trumpets)."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,13,9,"And when they came unto the goren Kidon, Uzza reached his yad to steady the Aron; for the ox tilted it."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,13,10,"And the Af Hashem was kindled against Uzza, and He struck him down, because he put his yad to the Aron, and there he died before Elohim."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,13,11,"And Dovid burned with anger, because Hashem had made a peretz (outburst) , breaking out upon Uzza, wherefore that makom is called Peretz-Uzzah to this day."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,13,12,"And Dovid was afraid of HaElohim that day, saying, How shall I bring the Aron HaElohim to me?"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,13,13,"So Dovid brought not the Aron to himself to Ir Dovid, but took it aside into the bais Oved-Edom the Gitti."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,13,14,"And the Aron HaElohim remained with the Bais Oved-Edom in his bais three months. And Hashem made a brocha upon the Bais Oved-Edom, and all that he had."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,14,1,"Now Churam Melech Tzor sent malachim to Dovid, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him a bais (palace)."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,14,2,"And Dovid perceived that Hashem had established him Melech over Yisroel, for his malchut was lifted up on high, for the sake of His people Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,14,3,And Dovid took more nashim at Yerushalayim; and Dovid fathered more banim and banot.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,14,4,"Now these are the shmot of his banim which were born in Yerushalayim: Shammua, and Shovav, Natan, and Sh'lomo,"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,14,5,"And Yivchar, and Elishua, and Elpelet,"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,14,6,"And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Yaphia,"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,14,7,"And Elishama, and Be'elyada, and Eliphalet."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,14,8,"And when the Pelishtim (Philistines) heard that Dovid nimshach (was anointed) Melech over kol Yisroel, all the Pelishtim went up to search for Dovid. Dovid heard of it, and went out against them."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,14,9,And the Pelishtim (Philistines) came and spread out in the Emek Repha'im.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,14,10,"And Dovid inquired of Elohim, saying, Shall I go up against the Pelishtim? And wilt Thou deliver them into mine yad? And Hashem said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine yad."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,14,11,"So they came up to Ba'al-Peratzim; and Dovid defeated them there. Then Dovid said, Elohim hath broken out upon mine oyevim by mine yad like the peretz mayim (breaking forth of waters) ; therefore they called the shem of that makom Ba'al-Peratzim."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,14,12,"And when they had abandoned their elohim there, Dovid gave a commandment, and they were burned with eish."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,14,13,And the Pelishtim (Philistines) yet again spread out in the emek (valley).
Divrey Hayamim Alef,14,14,"Therefore Dovid inquired again of Elohim, and Elohim said unto him, Go not up after them; circle around upon them, and come upon them opposite the mulberry trees."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,14,15,"And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt go out to milchamah; for HaElohim is gone forth before thee to strike the machaneh Pelishtim."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,14,16,"Dovid therefore did as Elohim commanded him, and they struck down the machaneh Pelishtim from Giv'on even to Gezer."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,14,17,And the shem (fame) of Dovid went out into all lands; and Hashem brought the pachad (terror) of him upon kol HaGoyim.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,15,1,"And Dovid made him batim (buildings) in Ir Dovid, and prepared a makom for Aron HaElohim, and pitched for it an ohel."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,15,2,"Then Dovid said, None may carry Aron HaElohim but the Levi'im; for them hath Hashem bachar (chosen) to carry the Aron HaElohim, and to minister unto Him ad olam."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,15,3,"And Dovid assembled kol Yisroel together at Yerushalayim, to bring up Aron Hashem unto his makom (place, home) which he had prepared for it."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,15,4,"And Dovid assembled the Bnei Aharon, and the Levi'im;"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,15,5,"Of the Bnei Kehat; Uriel the sar, and his brethren a 120;"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,15,6,"Of the Bnei Merari; Asayah the sar, and his brethren 220;"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,15,7,Of the Bnei Gershom; Yoel the sar and his brethren 130;
Divrey Hayamim Alef,15,8,"Of the Bnei Elitzaphan; Shema'yah the sar, and his brethren 200;"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,15,9,"Of the Bnei Chevron; Eliel the sar, and his brethren 80;"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,15,10,"Of the Bnei Uzziel; Amminadav the sar, and his brethren 112."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,15,11,"And Dovid summoned Tzadok and Evyatar (Abiathar) the Kohanim, as well as the Levi'im, for Uriel, Asayah, and Yoel, Shema'yah, and Eliel, and Amminadav,"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,15,12,"And said unto them, Ye are the rashei ha'avot of the Levi'im; set yourselves apart as kodesh, both ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up Aron Hashem Elohei Yisroel unto the place that I have prepared for it."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,15,13,"For because ye did it not at the first, Hashem Eloheinu broke out upon us, for that we inquired of Him not according to the mishpat (due order, ordinance)."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,15,14,So the Kohanim and the Levi'im set themselves apart as kodesh to bring up Aron Hashem Elohei Yisroel.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,15,15,"And the Bnei HaLevi'im bore the Aron HaElohim upon their shoulders with the motot (poles) thereon, as Moshe commanded according to the Devar Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,15,16,"And Dovid spoke to the Sarei HaLevi'im to appoint their brethren to be the meshorerim (singers) with instruments of music, nevalim (lyres) and kinnorot (harps) and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with simchah."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,15,17,"So the Levi'im appointed Heman Ben Yoel; and of his brethren, Asaph Ben Berechyahu; and of the Bnei Merari their brethren, Eitan Ben Kushayahu;"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,15,18,"And with them their brethren of the next rank, Zecharyah, Ben, and Ya'aziel, and Shemiramot, and Yechiel, and Unni, Eliav, and Benayahu, and Ma'aseiyahu, and Mattityahu, and Eliph'lehu, and Mikneyahu, and Oved-Edom, and Ye'iel, the sho'arim (gatekeepers)."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,15,19,"So the meshorerim (singers) , Heman, Asaph, and Eitan, sounded the cymbals of nechoshet;"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,15,20,"And Zecharyah, and Aziel, and Shemiramot, and Yechiel, and Unni, and Eliav, and Ma'aseiyahu, and Benayahu, with nevalim (lyres) al-alamot (after the manner of virgins);"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,15,21,"And Mattityahu, and Eliph'lehu, and Mikneyahu, and Oved-Edom, and Ye'iel, and Azazyahu, with kinnorot (harps) al-HaSheminit to direct."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,15,22,"And Kenanyahu, sar HaLevi'im, was for singing; he directed the song, because of his understanding."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,15,23,And Berechyah and Elkanah were shoarim (doorkeepers) for the Aron.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,15,24,"And Shevanyahu, and Yoshaphat, and Netan'el, and Amasai, and Zecharyah, and Benayahu, and Eli'ezer, the Kohanim, did blow the trumpets before the Aron HaElohim; and Oved-Edom and Yechiyah were shoarim (doorkeepers) for the Aron."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,15,25,"So Dovid, and the Ziknei Yisroel, and the sarim over alafim, went to bring up Aron Brit Hashem out of the Bais Oved-Edom with simchah."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,15,26,"And it came to pass, when HaElohim helped the Levi'im that bore the Aron Brit Hashem , that they offered in sacrifice shivah bulls and shivah rams."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,15,27,"And Dovid was clothed with a me'il butz (fine linen robe) , and all the Levi'im that bore the Aron, and the meshorerim (singers) ; and Kenanyah the master of the song with the meshorerim; Dovid also had upon him a linen ephod."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,15,28,"Thus kol Yisroel brought up the Aron Brit Hashem with shouting, and with sound of the shofar, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, sounding nevalim (lyres) and kinnorot (harps)."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,15,29,"And it came to pass, as the Aron Brit Hashem came to Ir Dovid, that Michal Bat Sha'ul, looking out at the chalon, saw Dovid HaMelech dancing and whirling. And she despised him in her lev."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,1,"So they brought the Aron HaElohim, and set it inside the Ohel that Dovid had pitched for it; and they offered olot (burnt sacrifices) and shelamim before HaElohim."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,2,"And when Dovid had made an end of offering the olot and the shelamim, he blessed HaAm b'Shem Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,3,"And he apportioned to kol Ish Yisroel, both ish and isha, to every one a kikar lechem, and a good piece of meat, and a raisin cake."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,4,"And he appointed certain of the Levi'im as mesharetim (ministers) before the Aron Hashem , and to remember, and to thank and to praise Hashem Elohei Yisroel;"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,5,"Asaph HaRosh, and mishneh to him Zecharyah, Ye'iel, and Shemiramot, and Yechiel, and Mattityah, and Eliav, and Benayah, and Oved-Edom; and Ye'iel with instruments of nevalim (lyres) and with kinnorot; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals;"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,6,Benayah also and Yachaziel the Kohanim with khatzotzerot (trumpets) tamid (continually) before the Aron Brit HaElohim.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,7,Then on that day Dovid first committed the giving of thanks unto Hashem into the yad Asaph and his achim.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,8,"Give thanks unto Hashem , call upon Shmo, make known His deeds among the nations."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,9,"Sing unto Him, sing psalms unto Him, tell ye of all His nifle'ot (wondrous deeds)."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,10,Glory ye in Shem Kadesho; let the lev of them rejoice that seek Hashem.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,11,"Seek Hashem and His oz, seek His face tamid."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,12,"Remember His nifle'ot that He hath done, His mofetim, and the mishpatim of His mouth;"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,13,"O ye zera Yisroel His eved, ye Bnei Ya'akov, His chosen ones."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,14,He is Hashem Eloheinu; His mishpatim are in kol ha'aretz.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,15,Be ye mindful l'olam of His Brit; the davar which He commanded to an elef dor;
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,16,"Even of the Brit which He cut with Avraham, and of His shevu'a (oath) unto Yitzchak;"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,17,"And hath confirmed the same to Ya'akov for a chok (decree) , and to Yisroel for a Brit Olam,"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,18,"Saying, Unto thee will I give Eretz Kena'an, the chevel (portion) , the lot of your nachalah,"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,19,"When ye were but few, even a few, and gerim in it."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,20,"And when they went from goy (nation) to goy, and from one mamlachah to an Am acher (another people),"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,21,"He permitted no ish to oppress them; he reproved melachim for their sakes,"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,22,"Saying, Touch not Mine anointed ones, and do My nevi'im no harm."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,23,"Sing unto Hashem , kol ha'aretz; show forth from day to day His Yeshu'ah (salvation)."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,24,Declare His kavod among the Goyim; His nifle'ot among kol haAmim.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,25,"For gadol is Hashem , and greatly to be praised; He also is to be feared above kol elohim."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,26,"For kol elohei haAmim are elilim, but Hashem made Shomayim."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,27,"Hod and Hadar are in His presence; oz and chedvah (joy) are in His makom (place, home, dwelling)."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,28,"Ascribe unto Hashem , ye mishpechot Amim, ascribe unto Hashem Kavod and oz."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,29,"Ascribe unto Hashem the kavod due unto Shmo; bring a minchah, and come before Him; worship Hashem in the hadar (splendor) of kodesh (holiness)."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,30,"Fear before Him, kol ha'aretz; the tevel (world) also shall be firmly established, that it be not moved."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,31,"Let HaShomayim have simcha, and let ha'aretz rejoice; and let them say among the Goyim, Hashem reigneth."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,32,"Let the yam roar, and the fulness thereof; let the sadeh rejoice, and all that is therein."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,33,"Then shall the trees of the ya'ar (forest, woods) sing out before Hashem , because He cometh to judge ha'aretz."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,34,"O give thanks unto Hashem , for He is tov; for His chesed endureth l'olam."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,35,"And say ye, Hosheini, Elohei Yisheinu (G-d of our salvation) , and gather us together, and deliver us from the Goyim, that we may give thanks to Shem Kadshecha, and glory in Thy tehillah (praise)."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,36,"Baruch Hashem Elohei Yisroel min HaOlam v'ad HaOlam. And kol HaAm said, Omein, and praised Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,37,"So he left there before the Aron Brit Hashem Asaph and his achim, to minister before the Aron tamid (continually) , accordingly yom by its yom;"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,38,"And Oved-Edom with their achim, threescore and eight; Oved-Edom Ben Yedutun and Chosah as Shoarim (gatekeepers);"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,39,"And Tzadok HaKohen, and his achim the Kohanim, before the Mishkan Hashem in the bamah (high place) that was at Giv'on,"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,40,"To offer olot (burnt offerings) unto Hashem upon the Mizbe'ach HaOlah tamid (continually) boker and erev, and to do according to all that is written in the Torat Hashem , which He commanded Yisroel;"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,41,"And with them Heman and Yedutun, and the rest that were the Chosen ones, who were designated by shemot, to give thanksgiving to Hashem , ki l'olam chasdo."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,42,"And with them Heman and Yedutun with khatzotzerot (trumpets) and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with klei Shir HaElohim (musical instruments of G-d) . And the Bnei Yedutun were at the Sha'ar (gate)."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,16,43,And kol haAm departed every ish to his bais; and Dovid returned to bless his bais.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,17,1,"Now it came to pass, as Dovid sat in his bais, that Dovid said to Natan HaNavi, Hinei, I dwell in a bais ha'arazim (a palace of cedars) but the Aron Brit Hashem [dwelleth] under tent curtains."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,17,2,"Then Natan said to Dovid, Do all that is in thine levav; for HaElohim is with thee."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,17,3,"And it came to pass the same lailah, that the Devar Elohim came to Natan, saying,"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,17,4,"Go and tell Dovid Avdi, Thus saith Hashem , Thou shalt not build Me HaBayit to dwell in,"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,17,5,"For I have not dwelt in a Bayit since the day that I brought up Yisroel until this day, but have gone from ohel to ohel, and from one mishkan to another."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,17,6,"Wheresoever I have walked with kol Yisroel, spoke I a word to any of the Shofetim of Yisroel, whom I commanded to shepherd My people, saying, Why have ye not built me a Bais Arazim?"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,17,7,"Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto Avdi Dovid, Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os, I took thee from the naveh, even from following the tzon, that thou shouldest be Nagid over My people Yisroel;"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,17,8,"And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine oyevim from before thee, and have made thee a shem like the shem of the gedolim that are in ha'aretz."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,17,9,"Also I will ordain a makom for My people Yisroel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the bnei avel oppress them any more, as they did at the beginning,"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,17,10,"And since the time that I commanded Shofetim to be over My people Yisroel. Moreover I will subdue all thine oyevim. Furthermore I tell thee that Hashem will build thee a Bais (House, Dynasty)."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,17,11,"And it shall come to pass, when thy yamim are expired that thou must go to be with Avoteicha, that I will raise up thy zera after thee, which shall be of thy banim; and I will establish his Malchut ([Messianic] Kingdom)."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,17,12,"He shall build for Me a Bais, and I will establish his kisse ad olam."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,17,13,"I will be his Av, and he shall be My Ben; and I will not take My chesed away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee,"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,17,14,"But I will set him in Mine Bais and in My Malchut ad olam, and his kisse shall be established ad olam."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,17,15,"According to all these devarim, and according to all this chazon (revelation) , so did Natan speak unto Dovid."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,17,16,"And Dovid HaMelech came and sat before Hashem , and said, Who am I, Hashem Elohim, and what is mine bais, that Thou hast brought me hitherto?"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,17,17,"And as if this were not sufficient in Thine eyes, O Elohim, Thou hast also spoken of Bais Avdecha in the future afar off, and hast regarded me according to the estate of ha'adam hama'alah (the man of high degree) , O Hashem Elohim."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,17,18,What more can Dovid speak to Thee regarding the kavod of Thy eved? For Thou hast da'as of Thy eved.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,17,19," Hashem , for the sake of Thy eved, and according to Thine own lev (heart, will) , hast Thou done all this gedullah (greatness) , in making known kol hagedulot (all great things)."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,17,20," Hashem , there is none like Thee, neither is there any Elohim zulah (besides) Thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,17,21,"And what one goy (nation) in ha'aretz is like Thy people Yisroel, whom HaElohim went to redeem to be His own people, to make for Thee Shem Gedullot and Nora'ot, by driving out Goyim from before Thy people whom Thou hast redeemed out of Mitzrayim?"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,17,22,"For Thy people Yisroel didst Thou make Thine own people ad olam; Thou Hashem , became their Elohim."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,17,23,"Therefore now, Hashem , let the davar that Thou hast spoken concerning Thy eved and concerning his Bais be established ad olam, and do as Thou hast said."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,17,24,"Let it even be established, that Thy Shem may be magnified ad olam, saying, Hashem Tzva'os is Elohei Yisroel, even Elohim to Yisroel; let Bais Dovid Avdecha be established before Thee."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,17,25,"For Thou, O Elohai, hast revealed in the ozen of Thy eved that Thou wilt build him a Bais; therefore Thy eved hath found to daven in prayer before Thee."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,17,26,"Now, Hashem , Thou art HaElohim, and hast promised this tovah unto Thy eved."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,17,27,"Now therefore let it please Thee to make brocha upon the Bais of Thy eved, that it may be before Thee l'olam; for Thou makest brocha Hashem , and it shall be mevorech l'olam (blessed forever)."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,18,1,"Now after this it came to pass, that Dovid struck the Pelishtim, and subdued them, and took Gat and her villages out of the yad of the Pelishtim."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,18,2,"And he struck Moav, and Moav became Dovidʼs avadim, and brought minchah."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,18,3,"And Dovid struck Hadadezer Melech Tzovah unto Chamat, as he went to establish his dominion over the river Euphrates."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,18,4,"And Dovid captured from him elef chariots, and 7,000 parashim, and 20,000 foot soldiers. Dovid also hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved of them 100 chariot horses."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,18,5,"And when Aram Darmesek came to help Hadadezer Melech Tzovah, Dovid slaughtered of the Syrians 22,000 ish."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,18,6,"Then Dovid put garrisons in Aram Darmesek; and the Syrians became Dovidʼs avadim (subjects) , bearing minchah (tribute) . Thus Hashem saved Dovid wherever he went."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,18,7,"And Dovid took the shields of zahav that were on avadim of Hadadezer, and brought them to Yerushalayim."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,18,8,"Likewise from Tivchat, and from Kun, towns of Hadadezer, Dovid took very much nechoshet, wherewith Sh'lomo made the Yam HaNechoshet, and the Ammudim, and the kelei hanechoshet."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,18,9,"Now when To'u Melech Chamat heard how Dovid had struck down the whole army of Hadadezer Melech Tzovah,"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,18,10,"He sent Hadoram bno to HaMelech Dovid, to give him a shalom greeting, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and struck him down (for Hadadezer was an ish milchamah often against To'u); and he sent all manner kelim zahav, kesef and nechoshet."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,18,11,"Them also Dovid HaMelech dedicated as kodesh unto Hashem , with the kesef and the zahav that he brought from all these Goyim; from Edom, and from Moav, and from the Bnei Ammon, and from the Pelishtim, and from Amalek."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,18,12,Moreover Avishai Ben Tzeruyah slaughtered of Edom in the Gey HaMelach eighteen elef.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,18,13,"And he put garrisons in Edom, and kol Edom became Dovidʼs avadim. Thus Hashem saved Dovid wherever he went."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,18,14,"So Dovid reigned over kol Yisroel, and executed mishpat and tzedakah among all his people."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,18,15,"And Yoav Ben Tzeruyah was over the tzava (army) , and Yehoshaphat Ben Achilud was mazkir (recorder, secretary)."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,18,16,"And Tzadok Ben Achituv, and Avimelech Ben Evyatar (Abiathar) , were the Kohanim, and Shavsha was sofer (scribe),"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,18,17,And Benayahu Ben Yehoyada was over the Kereti and the Peleti; and the Bnei Dovid were the rishonim (first ones) at the side of HaMelech.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,19,1,"Now it came to pass after this, that Nachash Melech Bnei Ammon died, and bno reigned in his place."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,19,2,"And Dovid said, I will show chesed unto Chanun Ben Nachash, because aviv (his father) showed chesed to me. And Dovid sent malachim to bring condolences to him concerning aviv. So the avadim of Dovid came into the eretz Bnei Ammon to Chanun, to console him."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,19,3,"But the sarim of the Bnei Ammon said to Chanun, Thinkest thou that Dovid doth honor avicha, that he hath sent menachamim (comforters) unto thee? Are not his avadim come unto thee for to reconnoiter, and to overthrow, and to spy out ha'aretz?"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,19,4,"Therefore Chanun arrested Dovidʼs avadim, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle at the buttocks, and sent them away."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,19,5,"Then there went certain ones, and told Dovid about the anashim. And he sent to meet them, for the anashim were greatly humiliated. And HaMelech said, Tarry at Yericho until your zakan be grown, and then return."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,19,6,"And when the Bnei Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to Dovid, Chanun and the Bnei Ammon sent elef kikar (talents) kesef to hire them chariots and parashim out of Aram Naharayim, and out of Aram Ma'achah, and out of Tzovah."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,19,7,"So they hired thirty and two elef chariots, and Melech Ma'akhah and his troop, who came and encamped before Medeva. And the Bnei Ammon gathered themselves together from their towns, and moved out for milchamah."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,19,8,"And when Dovid heard of it, he sent Yoav, and kol tzava hagibborim."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,19,9,"And the Bnei Ammon came out, and drew up for milchamah before the gate of the Ir, and the melachim that were come were by themselves in the sadeh."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,19,10,"Now when Yoav saw that the milchamah was set against him before and behind, he chose out of all the best of Yisroel, and deployed them to engage Aram (the Syrians)."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,19,11,"And the rest of the people he delivered unto the yad of Avishai his brother, and they deployed to engage the Bnei Ammon."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,19,12,"And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt save me, but if the Bnei Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will save thee."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,19,13,"Chazak (Be strong) ! And let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the towns of Eloheinu, and let Hashem do that which is hatov in His eyes."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,19,14,So Yoav and the troop that were with him drew near before the Syrians unto the milchamah; and they fled before him.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,19,15,"And when the Bnei Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Avishai his brother, and entered into the ir. Then Yoav returned to Yerushalayim."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,19,16,"And when the Syrians saw that they were routed before Yisroel, they sent malachim, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the River, and Shophach sar tzava Hadadezer went before them."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,19,17,"And it was told Dovid; and he gathered kol Yisroel, and crossed over Yarden, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So when Dovid had so deployed, they fought with him."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,19,18,"But the Syrians fled before Yisroel; and Dovid slaughtered of the Syrians shivah alafim in chariots, and forty elef foot soldiers, and killed Shophach sar hatzava."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,19,19,"And when avadim of Hadadezer saw that they were routed before Yisroel, they made shalom with Dovid, and became his avadim; neither would the Syrians help the Bnei Ammon any more."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,20,1,"And it came to pass, at the time of eshuvat hashanah, at the time that melachim go out to battle, Yoav led forth the chayl hatzava, and laid waste the eretz Bnei Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But Dovid tarried at Yerushalayim. And Yoav struck Rabbah, and destroyed it."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,20,2,"And Dovid took the ateret of their melech from off his rosh, and found it to weigh a talent of zahav, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set upon rosh Dovid; and he brought also exceeding much plunder out of the Ir."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,20,3,"And he brought out the people that were in it, and consigned them to saws, and to picks of barzel (iron) , and to axes. Even so dealt Dovid with all the towns of the Bnei Ammon. And Dovid and kol HaAm returned to Yerushalayim."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,20,4,"And it came to pass after this, that there arose milchamah at Gezer with the Pelishtim (Philistines) ; at which time Sibbekhai the Chushati slaughtered Sippai, that was of the yeledim of the Repha'im, and they were subdued."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,20,5,"And there was milchamah again with the Pelishtim (Philistines) ; and Elchanan ben Yair slaughtered Lachmi the brother of Golyat (Goliath) the Gitti, whose spear staff was like a weaverʼs beam."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,20,6,"And yet again there was milchamah at Gat, where was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each yad, and six on each foot and he also was of Rapha descent."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,20,7,"But when he defied Yisroel, Yehonatan ben Shimea achi Dovid slaughtered him."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,20,8,"These were from the Rapha descended in Gat; and they fell by the yad of Dovid, and by the yad of his avadim."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,21,1,"And Satan stood up against Yisroel, and provoked Dovid to number Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,21,2,"And Dovid said to Yoav and to the sarei HaAm, Go, number Yisroel from Be'er-Sheva even to Dan; and bring the mispar (number) of them to me, that I may know it."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,21,3,"But Yoav answered, Hashem make His people a hundred times so many more as they be, but, adoni HaMelech, are not they all the avadim of adoni? Why then doth adoni require this thing? Why will he be a cause of ashmah to Yisroel?"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,21,4,"Nevertheless the davar HaMelech prevailed against Yoav. Therefore, Yoav departed, and went throughout kol Yisroel, and came to Yerushalayim."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,21,5,"And Yoav gave up the sum of the number of HaAm unto Dovid. And kol Yisroel were 1,100,000 ish that drew cherev; and Yehudah was 470,000 ish that drew cherev."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,21,6,"But Levi and Binyamin counted he not among them, for the davar HaMelech was abominable to Yoav."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,21,7,And HaElohim was displeased with this thing; therefore He struck Yisroel.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,21,8,"And Dovid said unto HaElohim, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing, but now, take away the avon of Thy eved, for I have done very foolishly."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,21,9,"And Hashem spoke unto Gad, Chozeh Dovid (seer of David) saying,"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,21,10,"Go and tell Dovid, saying, Thus saith Hashem , I offer thee shalosh (three) ; choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,21,11,"So Gad came to Dovid, and said unto him, Thus saith Hashem , Choose for thee,"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,21,12,"Either shalosh shanim ra'av (famine) ; or shloshah chodashim to be subdued before thy foes, while that the cherev of thine oyevim overtaketh thee; or else sheloshet yamim cherev Hashem , even the dever, in HaAretz, and the Malach Hashem destroying throughout all the borders of Yisroel. Now therefore advise thyself what davar I shalll bring to Him that sent me."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,21,13,"And Dovid said unto Gad, I am in a great distress; let me fall now into the Yad Hashem ; for rabbim me'od (very great) are His rachamim but let me not fall into the yad adam."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,21,14,"So Hashem sent dever upon Yisroel, and there fell of Yisroel shiv'im elef ish."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,21,15,"And HaElohim sent a Malach unto Yerushalayim to destroy her, and as he was destroying, Hashem beheld, and He relented Him of the ra'ah, and said to the Malach that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine yad. And the Malach Hashem stood by the goren (threshing floor) of Ornan the Yevusi."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,21,16,"And Dovid lifted up his eyes, and saw the Malach Hashem stand between Ha'Aretz and HaShomayim, having a drawn cherev in his yad stretched out over Yerushalayim. Then Dovid and the Zekenim, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,21,17,"And Dovid said unto HaElohim, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? Even I it is that have sinned and done harah indeed; but as for these tzon, what have they done? Let Thine Yad, Hashem Elohai, be on me, and on the Bais Avi, but not on Thy people, not with magefah (plague)."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,21,18,"Then the Malach Hashem commanded Gad to say to Dovid, that Dovid should go up, and set up a Mizbe'ach unto Hashem in the goren (threshing floor) of Ornan the Yevusi."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,21,19,"And Dovid went up at the davar of Gad, which he spoke B'Shem Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,21,20,"And Ornan turned back, and saw the Malach, and his four banim with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing chittim (wheat)."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,21,21,"And as Dovid came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw Dovid, and went out from the goren (threshing floor) , and prostated himself to Dovid with his face to the ground."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,21,22,"Then Dovid said to Ornan, Give me the makom of this goren (threshing floor) , that I may build a Mizbe'ach therein unto Hashem ; thou shalt give it me for the kesef male (full price) , that the magefah (plague) may be withdrawn from HaAm."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,21,23,"And Ornan said unto Dovid, Take it to thee, and let adoni HaMelech do that which is tov in his eyes; see, I give thee the bakar also for olot (burnt offerings) , and the threshing tools for wood, and the chittim (wheat) for the minchah (grain offering, meal offering) ; I give it all."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,21,24,"And HaMelech Dovid said to Ornan, Lo (no) , but I will verily buy it for the kesef male (full price) , for I will not take that which is thine for Hashem , nor offer olah (burnt offerings) without cost."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,21,25,"So Dovid gave to Ornan for the makom (place, site) six hundred shekels of zahav by weight."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,21,26,"And Dovid built there a Mizbe'ach unto Hashem , and offered olot (burnt offerings) and shelamim (peace offerings) , and called upon Hashem , and He answered him from Shomayim by eish upon the Mizbe'ach HaOlah."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,21,27,"And Hashem commanded the Malach, and He put back his cherev again into the nedan (sheath) thereof."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,21,28,"At that time when Dovid saw that Hashem had answered him on the goren (threshing floor) of Ornan the Yevusi, then he sacrificed there."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,21,29,"For the Mishkan Hashem , which Moshe made in the midbar, and the Mizbe'ach HaOlah, were at that time in the bamah (high place) at Giv'on."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,21,30,"But Dovid could not go before it to inquire of Elohim, for he was afraid because of the cherev Malach Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,22,1,"Then Dovid said, This is the Beis Hashem HaElohim, and this is the Mizbe'ach L'olah (Altar of the Burnt Offering) for Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,22,2,And Dovid commanded to gather together the gerim (aliens) that were in Eretz Yisroel; and he set masons to carve hewn stones to build the Beis HaElohim.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,22,3,"And Dovid prepared barzel (iron) in abundance for the masmerim (nails) for the daletot (doors) of the she'arim, and for the joints; and nechoshet unweighable in abundance;"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,22,4,"Also cedar timber in abundance, for the Tzidonim and the Tzorim brought much cedar lumber to Dovid."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,22,5,"And Dovid said, Sh'lomo beni (my son) is na'ar and tender, and the Bayit that is to be built for Hashem must be exceeding magnificent, of fame and of tiferet before all nations. I will therefore now make preparation for it. So Dovid prepared abundantly before his mot (death)."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,22,6,"Then he called for Sh'lomo bno, and charged him to build Bayit (House) for Hashem Elohei Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,22,7,"And Dovid said to Sh'lomo, Beni (my son) , as for me, it was in my mind to build Bayit (House) for the Shem of Hashem Elohai,"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,22,8,"But the Devar Hashem came to me, saying, Thou hast done much shefach dahm, and hast made milchamot gedolot. Thou shalt not build Bayit (House) unto Shemi (My Name) , because thou hast done much shefach dahm upon ha'aretz in My sight."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,22,9,"Hinei, Ben shall be born to thee, who shall be an ish menuchah (man of rest) ; and I will give him rest from all his oyevim all around; for shmo shall be Sh'lomo, and I will grant shalom and sheket (quiet) unto Yisroel in his yamim (days)."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,22,10,He shall build Bayit (House) for Shmi (My Name) ; and he shall be to Me as Ben and I will be to him as Av (Father) ; and I will establish the kisse of his Malchut over Yisroel ad olam.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,22,11,"Now, beni (my son), Hashem be with thee; and prosper thou, to succeed building the Beis Hashem Eloheicha, just as He hath said about thee."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,22,12,"Only Hashem give thee seichel and binah, so that when He give you command over Yisroel, that thou mayest be shomer over the torat Hashem Eloheicha."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,22,13,"Then shalt thou prosper, if thou art shomer to observe the chukkim and mishpatim which Hashem charged Moshe with concerning Yisroel. Chazak (be strong) ! And be of good courage! Dread nothing in fear, nor be dismayed."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,22,14,"Now, hinei, in my oni (poor strivings) I have prepared for the Beis Hashem a hundred elef talents of zahav, and an elef alafim talents of kesef; and of nechoshet and barzel (iron) an unweighable abundance; timber also and even (stone) have I provided; and thou mayest add thereto."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,22,15,"Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and carvers of even (stone) and etz (wood) , and all manner of artisans chacham in every task."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,22,16,"Of the zahav, the kesef, and the nechoshet, and the barzel, there is no number. Arise therefore, and begin and work, and Hashem be with thee."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,22,17,"Dovid also commanded all the sarim of Yisroel to help Sh'lomo bno, saying,"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,22,18,"Is not Hashem Eloheichem with you? And hath He not given you rest on every side? For He hath given the inhabitants of ha'aretz into mine yad, and ha'aretz is subdued before Hashem , and before His people."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,22,19,"Now set your levav and your nefesh to seek Hashem Eloheichem; arise therefore, and build ye the Mikdash Hashem HaElohim, to bring Aron Brit Hashem , and the K'lei Kodesh HaElohim (Holy Vessels of G-d) , into the Bayit that is to be built to the Shem of Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,23,1,"So when Dovid was old and full of days, he made Sh'lomo bno Melech Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,23,2,"And he gathered together all the sarim of Yisroel, with the Kohanim and the Levi'im."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,23,3,"Now the Levi'im were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward; and their number by their gulgelot (totals, head count) , gevarim (men) , was thirty and eight elef."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,23,4,"Of which, twenty and four elef were to look after the work of the Beis Hashem ; and six alafim were shoterim (officials) and shofetim (judges);"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,23,5,"Moreover four alafim were sho'arim (gatekeepers) ; and four alafim praised Hashem with the kelim (instruments) which I made, said Dovid, to praise therewith."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,23,6,"And Dovid divided them into divisions among the Bnei Levi, namely, Gershon, Kehat, and Merari."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,23,7,"Of the Gershoni were La'dan, and Shime'i."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,23,8,"The Bnei La'dan; the rosh was Yechiel, and Zetam, and Yoel, three."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,23,9,"The Bnei Shime'i; Shelomit, and Chaziel, and Haran, three. These were the rashei avot of La'dan."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,23,10,"And the Bnei Shime'i were Yachat, Zina, and Ye'ush, and Beri'ah. These four were the Bnei Shime'i."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,23,11,"And Yachat was rosh, and Zizah the second; but Ye'ush and Beri'ah had not many banim; therefore they were in pekudah echad (one reckoning) , according to their bais av."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,23,12,"The Bnei Kehat; Amram, Yitzhar, Chevron, and Uzziel, four."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,23,13,"The Bnei Amram; Aharon and Moshe; Aharon was separated, to set him apart as Kodesh Kodashim, he and his banim ad olam, to burn offerings before Hashem , to minister unto Him, and to bless b'Shmo ad olam."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,23,14,"Now concerning Moshe the Ish HaElohim, his banim were reckoned of the Shevet Levi."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,23,15,"The Bnei Moshe were Gershom, and Eli'ezer."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,23,16,"Of the Bnei Gershom, Shevuel was the rosh."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,23,17,And the Bnei Eli'ezer were Rechavyah the rosh. And Eli'ezer had no banim acharim; but the Bnei Rechavyah were very many.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,23,18,Of the Bnei Yitzhar: Shelomit the rosh.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,23,19,"Of the Bnei Chevron: Yeriyahu the first, Amaryah the seond, Yachaziel the third, and Yekam'am the fourth."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,23,20,Of the Bnei Uzziel: Michah the first and Yishiyah the second.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,23,21,"The Bnei Merari: Machli, and Mushi. The Bnei Machli; El'azar, and Kish."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,23,22,"And El'azar died, and had no banim, only banot, and their brethren the Bnei Kish took them as wives."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,23,23,"The Bnei Mushi; Machli, and Eder, and Yeremot, three."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,23,24,"These were the Bnei Levi after the bais avoteihem; even the rashei avot, as they were counted by number of shmot by their head count, that did the work for the avodas Beis Hashem , from the age of twenty shanah and upward."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,23,25,"For Dovid said, Hashem Elohei Yisroel hath given rest unto His people, that they may dwell in Yerushalayim ad l'olam;"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,23,26,"And also unto the Levi'im; they shall no more carry the Mishkan, nor any kelim (vessels) of it for the avodah thereof."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,23,27,According to the last instructions of Dovid the Bnei Levi were numbered from those twenty shanah and above;
Divrey Hayamim Alef,23,28,"Because their ma'amad (position) was to wait on the Bnei Aharon for the avodas Beis Hashem , in the khatzerot, and in the rooms, and in the tahorat (cleansing) of kol kodesh, and the work of the avodas Beis HaElohim;"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,23,29,"Both for the Lechem HaMa'arechet (showbread) , and for the solet (flour) for minchah, and for the cakes of matzot, and for that which is baked in the pan, and for that which is scalded, and for all manner of measure and size;"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,23,30,"And to stand baboker baboker to thank and praise Hashem , and likewise at erev (evening);"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,23,31,"And to offer all olot (burnt offerings) unto Hashem on Shabbatot, at Rosh Chodesh, and at mo'adim, according to their number ordained for them, tamid before Hashem;"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,23,32,"And that they should be shomer to keep the mishmeret (watch, guard responsibility) of the Ohel Mo'ed and the mishmeret of the Kodesh, and the mishmeret of the Bnei Aharon their brethren, in the avodas Beis Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,24,1,"Now these are the divisions of the Bnei Aharon; the Bnei Aharon; Nadav, and Avihu, El'azar, and Itamar."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,24,2,"But Nadav and Avihu died before avihem (their father) , and had no banim; therefore El'azar and Itamar became Kohanim."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,24,3,"And Dovid with both Tzadok of the Bnei El'azar, and Achimelech of the Bnei Itamar, divided them according to their pekudim (offices, assignments) in their avodah."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,24,4,"And there were more Rashei HaGevarim found of the Bnei El'azar than of the Bnei Itamar, and thus were they divided. Among the Bnei El'azar there were sixteen Rashim l'Bais Avot, and eight among the Bnei Itamar according to the Bais of their Avot."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,24,5,"Thus were they divided by goralot (lots) with one another; for the Sarei Kodesh and Sarei HaElohim, were of the Bnei El'azar, and of the Bnei Itamar."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,24,6,"And Shema'yah ben Netan'el the Sofer, one of the Levi'im, wrote them before HaMelech, and the Sarim, and Tzadok HaKohen, and Achimelech ben Evyatar (Abiathar) , and before the Rashei HaAvot of the Kohanim and Levi'im, Bais Avechad being chosen for El'azar, and one chosen for Itamar."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,24,7,"Now the first goral (lot) came forth to Yehoyariv, the second to Yedayah,"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,24,8,"The third to Charim, the fourth to Seorim,"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,24,9,"The fifth to Malkiyah, the sixth to Miyamin,"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,24,10,"The seventh to Hakotz, the eighth to Aviyah,"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,24,11,"The ninth to Yeshua, the tenth to Shekanyahu,"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,24,12,"The eleventh to Elyashiv, the twelfth to Yakim,"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,24,13,"The thirteenth to Chuppah, the fourteenth to Yeshevav,"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,24,14,"The fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,24,15,"The seventeenth to Chezir, the eighteenth to Happitzetz,"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,24,16,"The nineteenth to Petachyah, the twentieth to Yechezkel,"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,24,17,"The one and twentieth to Yachin, the two and twentieth to Gamul,"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,24,18,"The three and twentieth to Delayahu, the four and twentieth to Ma'azyahu."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,24,19,"These were the pekudim (offices, assigments) of them in their avodah to come into the Bais Hashem , according to their mishpatim (regulations) , under Aharon Avihem just as Hashem Elohei Yisroel had commanded him."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,24,20,And the rest of the Bnei Levi were these: Of the Bnei Amram: Shuva'el; of the Bnei Shuva'el: Yechdeyahu.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,24,21,"Concerning Rechavyahu, of the Bnei Rechavyahu, the first was Yishiyah."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,24,22,Of the Yitzhari: Shelomot; of the Bnei Shelomot: Yachat.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,24,23,"And [the Bnei Chevron]: Yeriyahu the first, Amaryahu the second, Yachaziel the third, Yekam'am the fourth."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,24,24,Of the Bnei Uzziel: Michah; of the Bnei Michah: Shamir.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,24,25,The brother of Michah was Yishiyah; of the Bnei Yishiyah: Zecharyah.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,24,26,"The Bnei Merari were Machli and Mushi; the Bnei Ya'aziyahu, Beno."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,24,27,"The Bnei Merari: by Ya'aziyahu: Beno, and Shoham, and Zakkur, and Ivri."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,24,28,"Of Machli came El'azar, who had no banim."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,24,29,Concerning Kish: the ben Kish was Yerachme'el.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,24,30,"The Bnei Mushi: Machli, and Eder, and Yerimot. These were the Bnei HaLevi'im after the Bais Avoteihem."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,24,31,"These likewise cast goralot (lots) corresponding to their brethren the Bnei Aharon in the presence of Dovid HaMelech, and Tzadok, and Achimelech, and the Rashei HaAvot LaKohanim and Levi'im, even the Avot HaRosh as well as Achiv HaKatan."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,25,1,"Moreover Dovid and the sarim of the tzava separated for avodah of the Bnei Asaph, and of Heman, and of Yedutun, who should prophesy with kinnorot, with nevalim, and with cymbals; and the number of the workmen according to their avodah (service) was;"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,25,2,"Of the Bnei Asaph; Zakkur, and Yosef, and Netanyah, and Asarelah, the Bnei Asaph under the hand of Asaph, which prophesied according to the order of HaMelech."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,25,3,"Of Yedutun, the Bnei Yedutun: Gedalyahu, and Tzeri, and Yeshayahu, Chashavyahu, and Mattityahu, six, under the hands of their av Yedutun, who prophesied with a kinnor, to give thanks and to praise Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,25,4,"Of Heman, the Bnei Heman: Bukiyahu, Matanyahu, Uzziel, Shevuel, and Yerimot, Chananyah, Chanani, Eliatah, Giddalti, and Romamti-Ezer, Yoshbekashah, Maloti, Hotir, and Machazi'ot;"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,25,5,"All these were the banim Heman the chozer (seer) of HaMelech in the devarim of Elohim, to lift up the keren. And HaElohim gave to Heman fourteen banim and three banot."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,25,6,"All these were under the hands of their av for shir in the Beis Hashem , with cymbals, nevalim, and kinnorot, for avodas Beis HaElohim, under the support of HaMelech to Asaph, Yedutun, and Heman."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,25,7,"So the number of them, with their brethren that were trained in the shir Hashem (music, songs of Hashem) , even all that were skilled, was two hundred fourscore and eight."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,25,8,"And they cast goralot, shift against shift, katon as well as gadol, the meiven as well as the talmid (student)."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,25,9,"Now the first goral which was for Asaph fell to Yosef; the second to Gedalyahu, who with his brethren and banim were 12;"

Divrey Hayamim Alef,26,1,"Concerning the divisions of the sho'arim (gatekeepers) ; Of the Korchim was Meshelemyahu Ben Kore, of the Bnei Asaph."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,26,2,"And the banim of Meshelemyahu were Zecharyahu the bechor, Yedi'ael the second, Zevadyahu the third, Yatniel the fourth,"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,26,3,"Eilam the fifth, Yehochanan the sixth, Elyeho'einai the seventh."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,26,4,"Moreover the banim of Oved-Edom were Shema'yah the bechor, Yehozavad the second, Yoach the third, and Sachar the fourth, and Netan'el the fifth,"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,26,5,"Ammi'el the sixth, Yissakhar the seventh, Peultai the eighth; for Elohim blessed him."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,26,6,"Also unto Shema'yah bno were banim born, that ruled throughout the bais avihem, for they were gibborei chayil."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,26,7,"The Bnei Shema'yah: Otni, and Repha'el, and Oved, Elzavad, whose brethren were bnei chayil, Elihu, and Semakhyahu."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,26,8,"All these of the Bnei Oved-Edom; they and their banim and their brethren, ish chayil for ko'ach for the avodah, were threescore and two of Oved-Edom."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,26,9,"And Meshelemyahu had banim and brethren, bnei chayil, eighteen."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,26,10,"Also Chosah, of the Bnei Merari, had banim; Shimri the rosh, (for though he was not the bechor, yet avihu appointed him rosh);"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,26,11,"Chilkiyahu the second, Tevalyahu the third, Zecharyahu the fourth; all the banim and brethren of Chosah were thirteen."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,26,12,"Among these were the divisions of the sho'arim, even among the rashei hagibborim, having mishmeret (duties) , just as their brethren, to minister service in the Beis Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,26,13,"And they cast goralot, the katon as well as the gadol, to their bais avot, for every sha'ar."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,26,14,"And the goral for the east fell to Shelemyahu. Then for Zecharyahu bno, a yo'etz (counselor) with seichel (wisdom) , they cast goralot; and his goral fell out northward."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,26,15,To Oved-Edom southward; and to his banim the Asuppim Bais.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,26,16,"To Shuppim and Chosah the goral came forth westward, with the Sha'ar Shallechet, by the upper road, mishmar (guard) corresponded to mishmar."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,26,17,"Eastward were six Levi'im, northward four a day, southward four a day, and toward Asuppim shnayim shnayim (two and two)."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,26,18,"At Parbar westward, four at the road, and two at Parbar."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,26,19,"These are the divisions of the sho'arim among the Bnei Korchi, and among the Bnei Merari."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,26,20,"And of the Levi'im, Achiyah was over the otzarot of the Beis HaElohim, and over the otzarot of the kodashim."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,26,21,"As concerning the Bnei La'dan; the Bnei HaGershuni through La'dan, rashei ha'avot, even of La'dan the Gershoni, were Yechieli."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,26,22,"The Bnei Yechieli: Zetam, and Yoel his brother, which were over the otzarot of the Beis Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,26,23,"Of the Amrami, and the Yitzhari, the Chevroni, and the Uzzieli;"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,26,24,"And Shevuel Ben Gershom Ben Moshe, was nagid of the otzarot."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,26,25,"And his brethren by Eli'ezer: Rechavyahu bno, and Yeshayahu bno, and Yoram bno, and Zichri bno, and Shelomit bno."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,26,26,"Which Shelomot and his brethren were over all the otzarot of the kodashim, which Dovid HaMelech, and the rashei ha'avot, the sarim over alafim and me'ot, and the sarim of the tzava (army) , had dedicated as kodesh."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,26,27,Out of the plunder won in battles did they dedicate as kadosh to maintain the Beis Hashem.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,26,28,"And all that Shmuel the ro'eh (seer) , and Sha'ul Ben Kish, and Avner Ben Ner, and Yoav Ben Tzeruyah, had dedicated as kodesh; and whosoever had dedicated any thing, it was under the yad of Shelomit, and of his brethren."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,26,29,"Of the Yitzhari, Kenanyahu and his banim were for the outside labor of Yisroel, for shoterim (officials) and shofetim (judges)."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,26,30,"And of the Chevroni, Chashavyahu and his brethren, bnei chayil, an elef and shivah me'ot (hundred) , were in charge of Yisroel on this side of the Yarden westward in all the work of Hashem , and in the avodas HaMelech."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,26,31,"Among the Chevroni was Yeriyah the rosh, even among the Chevroni, according to the toldot of his avot. In the fortieth year of the reign of Dovid they were sought, and there were found among them gibborei chayil at Yazer of Gil'ad."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,26,32,"And his brethren, bnei chayil, were two thousand and shivah hundred rashei ha'avot, whom Dovid HaMelech put over the Reuveni, the Gadi, and the half tribe of Menasheh, for every matter pertaining to Elohim, and the affairs of HaMelech."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,27,1,"Now the Bnei Yisroel after their number, namely, the rashei ha'avot and sarim of alafim and me'ot (hundreds) , and their shoterim that served HaMelech in any matter of the divisions, which came in and went out chodesh b'chodesh (month by month) throughout all the months of the shanah, each division consisting of twenty and four elef."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,27,2,Over the first division for the chodesh harishon was Yashov'am Ben Zavdiel; and in his division were twenty and four elef.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,27,3,Of the Bnei Peretz was the rosh of all the sarim of the tzava'os (armies) for the first month.

Divrey Hayamim Alef,27,5,"The third sar (commander) of the tzava (army) for the third month was Benayahu Ben Yehoyada, the Kohen Rosh; and in his division were twenty and four elef."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,27,6,"This is that Benayahu, who was gibbor among the Shloshim (Thirty) , and over the Shloshim; and in his division was Ammizavad bno."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,27,7,"The fourth for the fourth month was Asahel the brother of Yoav, and Zevadyah bno after him; and in his division were twenty and four elef."

Divrey Hayamim Alef,27,22,"Of Dan, Azare'el Ben Yerocham. These were the sarim of the Shivtei Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,27,23,But Dovid took not the number of them from twenty shanim and under; because Hashem had said he would increase Yisroel like to the kokhavim of HaShomayim.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,27,24,"Yoav Ben Tzeruyah began to number, but he finished not, because there fell ketzef (wrath) on account of this against Yisroel; neither was the number put in the Divrei HaYamim of Melech Dovid."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,27,25,"And over the otzarot HaMelech was Azmavet Ben Adiel; and over the storehouses in the sadot, in the towns, and in the villages, and in the migdalot was Yehonatan Ben Uziyahu;"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,27,26,And over them that did the work of the sadeh to till the adamah was Ezri Ben Keluv;
Divrey Hayamim Alef,27,27,And over the kramim was Shime'i the Ramati; over the increase of the kramim for the wine vats was Zavdi the Shiphmi;
Divrey Hayamim Alef,27,28,"And over the zeitim and the sycomore trees that were in the Shefelah was Ba'al-Chanan the Gederi; over the shemen storehouses, Yoash;"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,27,29,And over the bakar (herd) that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharoni; over the bakar that were in the valleys was Shaphat Ben Adlai;
Divrey Hayamim Alef,27,30,Over the gemalim (camels) also was Ovil the Yishme'eli; and over the donkeys was Yechdeyahu the Meronoti;
Divrey Hayamim Alef,27,31,And over the tzon (flock) was Yaziz the Hagri. All these were the sarim of the property which pertained to Melech Dovid.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,27,32,"Also Yehonatan Dovidʼs dod (uncle) was a yoetz (counsellor) , an ish meivin, and a sofer; and Yechiel Ben Chachmoni was with the Bnei HaMelech;"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,27,33,And Achitophel was the yoetz l'Melech; and Chushai the Arki was the re'a HaMelech;
Divrey Hayamim Alef,27,34,"And after Achitophel was Yehoyada Ben Benayahu, and Evyatar (Abiathar) ; and the sar tzava (commander of the army) of HaMelech was Yoav."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,28,1,"And Dovid assembled kol Sarei Yisroel, the Sarei HaShevatim, and the Sarei HaMachlekot that ministered to HaMelech by course, and the Sarei HaAlafim, and Sarei HaMe'ot, and the Sarei kol rechush (stewards over all the property) and mikneh (livestock) of HaMelech, and of his banim, with the sarisim (palace officials) , and with the Gibborim, and with all the Gibbor chayil, unto Yerushalayim."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,28,2,"Then Dovid HaMelech stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my brethren, and my people. As for me, I had in mine levav to build a Bais Menuchah for the Aron Brit Hashem , and for the hadom (footstool) of Eloheinu, and had made ready to build;"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,28,3,"But HaElohim said unto me, Thou shalt not build a Bais for My Shem, because thou hast been an ish milchamot of shefach damim."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,28,4,"Howbeit Hashem Elohei Yisroel chose me before all the Bais Avi to be Melech over Yisroel l'olam; for He hath chosen Yehudah to be Nagid; and of the Bais Yehudah, the Bais Avi; and among the Bnei Avi He was pleased to make me Melech over kol Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,28,5,"And of all my banim, (for Hashem hath given me rabbim banim,) He hath chosen Sh'lomo beni (my son) to sit upon the kisse Malchut Hashem over Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,28,6,"And He said unto me, Sh'lomo binecha, he shall build My Bais and My khatzerot (courts, courtyards) , for I have chosen him to be Beni (My Son) , and I will be his Av."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,28,7,"Moreover I will establish his Malchut ad l'olam, if he be steadfast to do My mitzvot and My mishpatim, as on this yom."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,28,8,"Now therefore in the sight of kol Yisroel the kehal Hashem , and in the ears of Eloheinu, be shomer and seek for all the Mitzvot Hashem Eloheichem lema'an (in order that) ye may possess this eretz hatovah; and leave it for a nachalah for your banim after you ad olam."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,28,9,"And thou, Sh'lomo beni (my son) , know thou the Elohei Avicha, and serve Him with a lev shalem and with a nefesh chafetzah (willing mind) , for Hashem searcheth kol levavot, and understandeth all the yetzer machashavot. If thou seek Him, He will be found by thee; but if thou forsake Him, He will cast thee off forever."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,28,10,"Take heed now, for Hashem hath chosen thee to build a Bais l'Mikdash. Chazak! And do it!"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,28,11,"Then Dovid gave to Sh'lomo bno the tavnit (plan, pattern) of the ulam, and of the structures thereof, and of the Ganzakim (storerooms) thereof, and of the Aliyyot (upper rooms) thereof, and of the Penimim (Inner ones) thereof, and of the Bais Hakappores (house of the kapporet),"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,28,12,"And the tavnit of all that he had by the Ruach, of the khatzerot (courtyards) of the Bais Hashem , and of all the surrounding chambers, of the Otzerot of the Bais HaElohim, and of the Otzerot of the kadashim (consecrated things);"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,28,13,"Also for the courses of the Kohanim and the Levi'im, and for all the work of the Avodas Bais Hashem , and for all the kelei Avodas Bais Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,28,14,"He gave zahav by weight for things of zahav, for all kelei Avodah of every kind of avodah (service) ; for all kelei hakesef by weight, for all kelei avodah va'avodah (vessels for every kind of service),"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,28,15,"Even the weight for the menorot hazahav, and for their nerot (lamps) of zahav was according to the weight for every menorah, and for the nerot (lamps) thereof; and for the menorat hakesef by weight, both for the menorah, and also for the nerot (lamps) thereof, according to the use of every menorah."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,28,16,And by weight he gave zahav for the Shulchanot HaMa'arechet (the tables of the spreading out) for each shulchan; and likewise kesef for the shulchanot hakesef (silver tables);
Divrey Hayamim Alef,28,17,"Also pure zahav for the mizlagot (forks) , and the mizrakot (blood bowls) , and shelves; kesot zahav tahor and the kipor hazahav (golden basin) for every kipor (basin) ; and likewise kesef by weight for every kipor hakesef (silver basin);"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,28,18,"And for the Mizbe'ach HaKetoret refined zahav by weight; and zahav for the tavnit of the Merkavah, the Keruvim Zahav, that spread out their wings, and covered the Aron Brit Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,28,19,"All this, said Dovid, is in writing by the Yad Hashem on me, giving me seichel to understand all the works of this tavnit (plan, pattern)."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,28,20,"And Dovid said to Sh'lomo bno, Chazak! Ve'emetz! (Be strong and take courage!) And do it; fear not, nor be discouraged; for Hashem Elohim, even Elohai, will be with thee; He will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work for the Avodas Bais Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,28,21,"And, hinei, the divisions of the Kohanim and the Levi'im, even they shall be with thee for all the Avodas Bais HaElohim and there shall be with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing man, bringing their chochmah for kol Avodah; also the Sarim and kol HaAm will be wholly at thy commandment."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,29,1,"Furthermore Dovid HaMelech said unto kol HaKahal, Sh'lomo beni (my son) , the one Elohim hath chosen, is yet na'ar and tender, and the melachah (work, task) is gedolah; for the palace is not for adam, but for Hashem Elohim."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,29,2,"Now I have provided with all my ko'ach for the Bais Elohai the zahav for things to be made of zahav, and the kesef for things of kesef, and the nechoshet for things of nechoshet, the barzel (iron) for things of barzel (iron) , and etzim for things of etzim; onyx stones to be set, turquoise, and stones of various colors, and all manner of precious stones, and marble, all in abundance."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,29,3,"Moreover, because I have set my affection on the Bais Elohai, I have of mine own segullah (treasure) zahav and kesef, which I have given to the Bais Elohai, over and above all that I have prepared for the Beis HaKodesh."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,29,4,"Even shloshet alafim talents of zahav, of the zahav of Ophir, and shivat alafim talents of refined kesef, to overlay the walls of the buildings;"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,29,5,"The zahav for things of zahav, and the kesef for things of kesef, and for all manner of melachah (work) to be made by the hands of charashim (artisans) . And who then is willing to consecrate his yad today unto Hashem?"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,29,6,"Then the sarei ha'avot and the sarei shivtei Yisroel and the sarei ha'alafim and of me'ot, with the sarei melechet hamelech (officials over the work of the King) , made freewill offerings."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,29,7,"And gave for the Avodas Beis HaElohim five thousand talents and ten thousand darkons of zahav, and ten thousand talents of kesef, and eighteen thousand talents of nechoshet, and one hundred thousand talents of barzel."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,29,8,"And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the Otzer Bais Hashem , by the yad of Yechiel the Gershoni."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,29,9,"Then the people rejoiced, for theirs were freewill offerings, because with lev shalem they offered willingly to Hashem ; and Dovid HaMelech also rejoiced with simchah gedolah."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,29,10,"Wherefore Dovid blessed Hashem before the eyes of kol HaKahal; and Dovid said, Baruch atah Adonoi Elohei Yisroel Avinu meOlam v'ad olam."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,29,11,"Thine, Hashem is HaGedulah, and HaGevurah, and HaTiferet and HaNetzach and HaHod; for all that is in the Shomayim and in Ha'aretz is Thine; Thine is the Mamlachah, O Hashem , and Thou art exalted as Rosh above all."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,29,12,"Both osher and kavod come of Thee, and Thou art Moshel over all; and in Thine yad is ko'ach and gevurah; and in Thine yad it is to make great, and to give strength unto all."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,29,13,"Now therefore, Eloheinu, we thank Thee, and praise Thy Shem Tiferet."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,29,14,"But who am I, and what is my people, that we should have ko'ach to make this freewill offering? For all things come of Thee, and of Thine own have we given Thee."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,29,15,"For we are gerim before Thee, and toshavim (resident aliens) , as were kol Avoteinu; our yamim on ha'aretz are as a tzel (shadow) , and there is no mikveh (hope)."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,29,16," Hashem Eloheinu, all this great abundance that we have provided to build Thee a Bais for Shem Kadshecha cometh of Thine yad, and is all Thine own."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,29,17,"I know also, Elohai, that Thou doth test the levav, and hast pleasure in meisharim (integrities, uprightness, equity) . As for me, in the yosher levavi I have made freewill offerings of all these things, and now have I seen with simchah Thy people, which are present here, willingly offer freewill offerings unto Thee."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,29,18," Hashem Elohei Avraham, Yitzchak, and of Yisroel, Avoteinu, be shomer over this l'olam in the yetzer (inclination) of the machshevot (thoughts) of the levav of Thy people, and set their lev unto Thee."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,29,19,"And give unto Sh'lomo beni a levav shalem, to be shomer over Thy mitzvot, Thy edot, and Thy chukkot, and to do all these things, and to build the Bayit, for the which I have made provision."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,29,20,"And Dovid said to kol HaKahal, Barchu nah es Hashem Eloheichem. And kol HaKahal blessed Hashem Elohei Avoteihem, and bowed down, and fell prostrate before Hashem and before HaMelech."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,29,21,"And they sacrificed zevakhim unto Hashem , and offered olot unto Hashem , on the next day after that yom, even a thousand parim (bulls) , a thousand eilim (rams) , and a thousand kevasim, with their nesakhim, and zevakhim in abundance for kol Yisroel;"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,29,22,"And did eat and drink before Hashem on that day with simchah gedolah. And they crowned Sh'lomo Ben Dovid Melech the second time, and anointed him unto Hashem to be Nagid (ruler) , and Tzadok to be Kohen."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,29,23,"Then Sh'lomo sat on the kisse Hashem as Melech instead of Dovid Aviv, and prospered, and kol Yisroel obeyed him."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,29,24,"And all the sarim, and the gibborim, and all the Bnei HaMelech Dovid submitted themselves unto Sh'lomo HaMelech."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,29,25,"And Hashem magnified Sh'lomo exceedingly in the eyes of all Yisroel, and bestowed upon him such hod malchut (royal majesty) as had not been on any melech before him in Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,29,26,Thus Dovid Ben Yishai reigned over kol Yisroel.
Divrey Hayamim Alef,29,27,"And the time that he reigned over Yisroel was arba'im shanah; sheva shanim reigned he in Chevron, and thirty and three reigned he in Yerushalayim."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,29,28,"And he died in a good old age, full of yamim, oisher, and kavod; and Sh'lomo bno reigned in his place."
Divrey Hayamim Alef,29,29,"Now the acts of Dovid HaMelech, first and last, behold, they are written in the Divrei Shmuel HaRo'eh, and in the Divrei Natan HaNavi, and in the Divrei Gad the chozeh (seer),"
Divrey Hayamim Alef,29,30,"With all his malchut and his gevurah, and the times that passed around him, and around Yisroel, and over kol mamlechot ha'aratzot (kingdoms of the lands)."
