Yehoshua,1,1,"Now after the mot Moshe Eved Hashem it came to pass, that Hashem spoke unto Yehoshua ben Nun, mesharet Moshe, saying,"
Yehoshua,1,2,"Moshe Avdi is dead; now therefore arise, cross over this Yarden, thou, and kol HaAm Hazeh, unto HaAretz which I do give to them, even to the Bnei Yisroel."
Yehoshua,1,3,"Every place that the sole of your regel shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, just as I said unto Moshe."
Yehoshua,1,4,"From the midbar and this Levanon even unto the Nahar Hagadol, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Chittim, and unto the Yam HaGadol toward the going down of the shemesh, shall be your territory."
Yehoshua,1,5,"There shall not any ish be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life; as I was with Moshe, so I will be with thee; I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee."
Yehoshua,1,6,"Chazak! (be strong!) And be of good courage: for unto HaAm Hazeh shalt thou divide for a nachalah HaAretz, which I swore unto their avot to give them."
Yehoshua,1,7,"Only chazak (be strong) and very courageous, that thou mayest be shomer to do according to kol HaTorah, which Moshe Avdi commanded thee; turn not from it to the yamin or to the semol, in order that thou mayest succeed everywhere thou goest."
Yehoshua,1,8,"This Sefer HaTorah shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate on it yomam valailah so that thou mayest be shomer to do according to all that is written therein; for then thou shalt make thy derech prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success."
Yehoshua,1,9,"Have not I commanded thee? Chazak! And be of good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed; for Hashem Eloheicha is with thee everywhere thou goest."
Yehoshua,1,10,"Then Yehoshua commanded the Shotrei HaAm, saying,"
Yehoshua,1,11,"Pass through the machaneh, and command HaAm, saying, Prepare you supplies; for within shloshet yamim ye shall pass over this Yarden, to go in to possess HaAretz, which Hashem Eloheichem giveth you to possess it."
Yehoshua,1,12,"And to the Reuveni, and to the Gadi, and to the half tribe of Menasheh, spoke Yehoshua, saying,"
Yehoshua,1,13,"Remember the devar which Moshe Eved Hashem commanded you, saying, Hashem Eloheichem hath given you menuchah, and hath given you HaAretz Hazot."
Yehoshua,1,14,"Your nashim, your little ones, and your livestock, shall remain in the land which Moshe gave you beyond the Yarden; but ye shall cross over ahead of your achim armed, all the gibborei hachayil, and help them;"
Yehoshua,1,15,"Until Hashem has given your achim menuchah, as He hath given you, and they also have possessed HaAretz which Hashem Eloheichem giveth them; then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and occupy it, which Moshe Eved Hashem gave you beyond Yarden toward the rising of the shemesh."
Yehoshua,1,16,"And they answered Yehoshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we will do, and everywhere thou sendest us, we will go."
Yehoshua,1,17,"According as we paid heed unto Moshe in all things, so will we pay heed unto thee; only Hashem Eloheicha be with thee, just as He was with Moshe."
Yehoshua,1,18,"Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not pay heed unto thy devarim in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death; rak chazak (only be strong) and be of good courage."
Yehoshua,2,1,"And Yehoshua ben Nun sent out of Sheetim shnayim anashim (two men) to spy secretly, saying, Go view HaAretz, even Yericho. And they went, and entered into bais isha zonah, and her name was Rachav, and they lodged there."
Yehoshua,2,2,"And it was told Melech Yericho, saying, Hinei, anashim have come here halailah of the Bnei Yisroel to spy out HaAretz."
Yehoshua,2,3,"And the Melech Yericho sent unto Rachav, saying, Bring forth the anashim that are come to thee, who entered into thine bais; for they have come to spy out kol HaAretz."
Yehoshua,2,4,"And the isha took the two anashim, and hid them, and said thus, There came anashim unto me, but I knew not where they had come from;"
Yehoshua,2,5,"And it came to pass about the time of the shutting of the sha'ar, when it was choshech, that the anashim went out; where the anashim went I know not; pursue after them quickly; for ye may overtake them."
Yehoshua,2,6,"But she had brought them up to the gag (roof) , and hid them with the pishtei haetz (stalks of flax) , which she had laid out upon the gag."
Yehoshua,2,7,"So the anashim pursued after them the derech (road) to Yarden unto the fords; and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they closed the sha'ar."
Yehoshua,2,8,"And before they lay down, she went up unto them upon the gag;"
Yehoshua,2,9,"And she said unto the anashim, I know that Hashem hath given you HaAretz, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of HaAretz faint because of you."
Yehoshua,2,10,"For we have heard how Hashem dried up the waters of the Yam Suf from before you, when ye came out of Mitzrayim; and what ye did unto the two melachim of the Emori, that were beyond the Yarden, Sichon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed."
Yehoshua,2,11,"And as soon as we had heard these things, levaveinu (our hearts) did melt, neither did there remain any more ruach in any ish, because of you; for Hashem Eloheichem hu Elohim baShomayim above, and on HaAretz beneath."
Yehoshua,2,12,"Therefore, now, swear unto me by Hashem , since I have showed you chesed, that ye will also show chesed unto Bais Avi, and give me an ot emes (sign of truth);"
Yehoshua,2,13,"And that ye will save alive avi, and immi, and my ach and my achot, and all that they have, and deliver nafshoteinu (our lives, souls) from mavet (death)."
Yehoshua,2,14,"And the anashim answered her, Nafsheinu (our soul) shall die for you, if ye utter not what we are doing. And it shall be, when Hashem hath given us HaAretz, that we will deal chesed v'emes with thee."
Yehoshua,2,15,"Then she let them down by a chevel (cord, rope) through the chalon (window) ; for her bais was in the city wall, and she dwelt in the chomah (wall)."
Yehoshua,2,16,"And she said unto them, Get you to the hill country, lest the rodefim (pursuers) meet you; and hide yourselves there shloshet yamim, until the rodefim return; and afterward may ye go your way."
Yehoshua,2,17,"And the anashim said unto her, We will be nekiyyim (free ones) of this thine shevu'ah (oath) which thou hast made us swear,"
Yehoshua,2,18,"Unless when we come into HaAretz, thou shalt tie this rope of scarlet cord in the chalon by which thou didst let us down; and thou shalt bring thy av, and thy em, and thy achim, and all thy bais avi, with thee inside the bais."
Yehoshua,2,19,"And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the delatot of thy bais into the chutzah (street, outside) , his dahm shall be upon his rosh, and we will be nekiyyim (free ones) ; and whosoever shall be with thee in the bais, his dahm shall be on rosheinu (our head) , if any yad be laid upon him."
Yehoshua,2,20,"And if thou utter what we are doing, then we will be nekiyyim (free ones) of thine shevu'ah (oath) which thou hast made us to swear."
Yehoshua,2,21,"And she said, According unto your devarim, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed; and she tied the scarlet cord in the chalon."
Yehoshua,2,22,"And they went, and came unto the hill country, and abode there shloshet yamim, until the rodefim returned; and the rodefim sought them all along the derech, but found them not."
Yehoshua,2,23,"So the two anashim returned, and descended from the hill country, and passed over, and came to Yehoshua ben Nun, and told him all things that befell them;"
Yehoshua,2,24,"And they said unto Yehoshua, Truly Hashem hath delivered into yadeinu kol HaAretz; for even all the inhabitants of HaAretz do faint because of us."
Yehoshua,3,1,"And Yehoshua rose early in the boker; and they set out from Sheetim, and came to the Yarden, he and Kol Bnei Yisroel, and camped there before they crossed over."
Yehoshua,3,2,"And it came to pass after shloshet yamim, that the Shoterim went through the Machaneh;"
Yehoshua,3,3,"And they commanded HaAm, saying, When ye see the Aron Brit Hashem Eloheichem, and the Kohanim who are Levi'im bearing it, then ye shall move out from your makom, and follow after it."
Yehoshua,3,4,"Yet there shall be a rachok (distance, space) between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure; come not near unto it, that ye have da'as of the Derech by which ye must go; for ye have not passed this way heretofore."
Yehoshua,3,5,"And Yehoshua said unto HaAm, Set yourselves apart as kodesh; for tomorrow Hashem will do nifla'ot among you."
Yehoshua,3,6,"And Yehoshua spoke unto the Kohanim, saying, Take up the Aron HaBrit, and cross over before HaAm. And they took up the Aron HaBrit, and went before HaAm."
Yehoshua,3,7,"And Hashem said unto Yehoshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of kol Yisroel, that they may know that, as I was with Moshe, so I will be with thee."
Yehoshua,3,8,"And thou shalt command the Kohanim that bear the Aron HaBrit, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water of the Yarden, ye shall stand still in the Yarden."
Yehoshua,3,9,"And Yehoshua said unto the Bnei Yisroel, Come here, and hear the Divrei Hashem Eloheichem."
Yehoshua,3,10,"And Yehoshua said, Hereby ye shall have da'as that the El Chai is among you, and that He will without fail drive out from before you the Kena'ani, and the Chitti, and the Chivi, and the Perizzi, and the Girgashi, and HaEmori, and the Yevusi."
Yehoshua,3,11,"Hinei, the Aron HaBrit Adon Kol HaAretz passeth over before you into the Yarden."
Yehoshua,3,12,"Now therefore take you Shnei Asar Ish out of the Shivtei Yisroel, out of every tribe an ish."
Yehoshua,3,13,"And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the Kohanim bearing the Aron Hashem , Adon Kol HaAretz, shall rest in the waters of the Yarden, that the waters of the Yarden shall be cut off from the waters that flow down from above; and they shall stand in a heap."
Yehoshua,3,14,"So it came to pass, when HaAm moved out from their ohalim, to cross over the Yarden, and the Kohanim bearing the Aron HaBrit ahead of HaAm;"
Yehoshua,3,15,"And as they bearing the Aron were come unto the Yarden, and the feet of the Kohanim bearing the Aron touched the edge of the mayim, (for the Yarden overfloweth all its banks all the days of katzir [harvest]),"
Yehoshua,3,16,"That the waters which flowed down from above stood and rose up in a heap very far away at a town called Adam in the vicinity of Tzartan; and that which flowed down toward Yam HaAravah, the Yam HaMelach was completely cut off; and HaAm crossed over right by Yericho."
Yehoshua,3,17,"And the Kohanim bearing the Aron Brit Hashem stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Yarden, and Kol Yisroel passed over on dry ground, until Kol HaGoy were passed completely over the Yarden."
Yehoshua,4,1,"And it came to pass, when Kol HaGoy had completely passed over the Yarden, that Hashem spoke unto Yehoshua, saying,"
Yehoshua,4,2,"Take you Shneym Asar Anashim out of HaAm, out of every Shevet an ish,"
Yehoshua,4,3,"And command ye them, saying, Take you from here out of the middle of the Yarden, out of the place where the feet of the Kohanim stood firm, twelve avanim (stones) , and ye shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the malon (lodging place) , where ye shall lodge halailah (tonight)."
Yehoshua,4,4,"Then Yehoshua called the Shneym Asar Ish, whom he had prepared of the Bnei Yisroel, out of every tribe an Ish;"
Yehoshua,4,5,"And Yehoshua said unto them, Pass over before the Aron Hashem Eloheichem into the middle of the Yarden, and take you up every ish of you an even (stone) upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the Shivtei Bnei Yisroel;"
Yehoshua,4,6,"That this may be an ot among you, that when your banim ask in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these avanim?"
Yehoshua,4,7,"Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of the Yarden were cut off from before the Aron Brit Hashem ; when it passed over the Yarden, the waters of the Yarden were cut off; and these avanim shall be for a zikaron (memorial) unto the Bnei Yisroel ad olam (forever)."
Yehoshua,4,8,"And the Bnei Yisroel did so just as Yehoshua commanded, and took up Shtei Esreh Avanim out of the middle of the Yarden, just as Hashem spoke unto Yehoshua, according to the number of the Shivtei Bnei Yisroel, and carried them over with them unto the malon where they lodged, and laid them down there."
Yehoshua,4,9,"And Yehoshua set up Shteym Esreh Avanim in the middle of the Yarden, in the place where the feet of the Kohanim bearing the Aron HaBrit stood; and they are there unto this day."
Yehoshua,4,10,"For the Kohanim bearing the Aron stood in the middle of the Yarden, until everything was finished that Hashem commanded Yehoshua to speak unto HaAm, according to all that Moshe commanded Yehoshua; and HaAm hurried and crossed over."
Yehoshua,4,11,"And it came to pass, when Kol HaAm had completely crossed over, that the Aron Hashem crossed over, and the Kohanim, ahead of HaAm."
Yehoshua,4,12,"And the Bnei Reuven, and the Bnei Gad, and the half-tribe of Menasheh, crossed over armed ahead of the Bnei Yisroel, just as Moshe directed them;"
Yehoshua,4,13,"About forty thousand, battle-ready, crossed over before Hashem for milchamah, to the plains of Yericho."
Yehoshua,4,14,"On Yom Hahu Hashem magnified Yehoshua in the eyes of Kol Yisroel; and they feared him, just as they feared Moshe, all the days of his life."
Yehoshua,4,15,"And Hashem spoke unto Yehoshua, saying,"
Yehoshua,4,16,"Command the Kohanim bearing the Aron HaEdut, so that they come up out of the Yarden."
Yehoshua,4,17,"Yehoshua therefore commanded the Kohanim, saying, Come ye up out of the Yarden."
Yehoshua,4,18,"And it came to pass, when the Kohanim bearing the Aron Brit Hashem were come up out of the middle of the Yarden, and the soles of the feet of the Kohanim were set on dry land, that the waters of the Yarden returned unto their place, and overflowed all its banks, as they did before."
Yehoshua,4,19,"And HaAm came up out of the Yarden on the tenth day of the chodesh harishon, and camped at Gilgal, by the eastern border of Yericho."
Yehoshua,4,20,"And those twelve avanim, which they took out of the Yarden, did Yehoshua set in a pile at Gilgal."
Yehoshua,4,21,"And he spoke unto the Bnei Yisroel, saying, When your banim shall ask their avot in time to come, saying, What mean these avanim?"
Yehoshua,4,22,"Then ye shall let your banim know, saying, Yisroel crossed over this Yarden on yabashah (dry land)."
Yehoshua,4,23,"For Hashem Eloheichem dried up the waters of the Yarden from before you, until ye were passed over, just as Hashem Eloheichem did to Yam Suf, which He dried up from before us, until we were crossed over;"
Yehoshua,4,24,"So that Kol Ammei HaAretz (all the peoples of the earth) might know the Yad Hashem , that it is chazakah; so that ye might fear Hashem Eloheichem kol hayamim (all the days, forever)."
Yehoshua,5,1,"And it came to pass, when all the melachim of the HaEmori, which were beyond the Yarden westward, and all the melachim of the Kena'ani, which were by the Yam, heard that Hashem had dried up the waters of the Yarden from before the Bnei Yisroel, until they had passed over, their levav sank, neither was there ruach in them any more, because of the Bnei Yisroel."
Yehoshua,5,2,"At that time Hashem said unto Yehoshua, Make thee knives of flint, and do a second time the Bris Milah to the Bnei Yisroel."
Yehoshua,5,3,"And Yehoshua made him flint knives, and did Bris Milah to the Bnei Yisroel at Givat HaAralot."
Yehoshua,5,4,"And this is the reason why Yehoshua did the Bris Milah: Kol HaAm that came out of Mitzrayim, that were zekharim (males) , even Kol Anshei HaMilchamah, died in the midbar baderech, after they came out of Mitzrayim."
Yehoshua,5,5,"Now Kol HaAm that came out were Mulim (circumcised) ; but Kol HaAm that were born in the midbar baderech when they came forth out of Mitzrayim, them they had not given Bris Milah."
Yehoshua,5,6,"For the Bnei Yisroel walked arba'im shanah in the midbar, until Kol HaGoy that were Anshei HaMilchamah, which came out of Mitzrayim, were consumed, because they obeyed not the Kol Hashem (voice of Hashem) ; unto whom Hashem swore that He would not show them HaAretz, which Hashem swore unto their Avot that He would give us, Eretz zavat cholov u'devash."
Yehoshua,5,7,"And their banim, whom He raised up in their place, them Yehoshua gave Bris Milah; for they were arelim (uncircumcised) , because they had not given them Bris Milah baderech."
Yehoshua,5,8,"And it came to pass, when they had done giving Bris Milah to Kol HaGoy, that they abode in their places in the machaneh, until they were chayyah (healed, whole, restored alive)."
Yehoshua,5,9,"And Hashem said unto Yehoshua, This day galloti (have I rolled away) the reproach of Mitzrayim from off you. Therefore the shem of the place is called Gilgal unto this day."
Yehoshua,5,10,"And the Bnei Yisroel encamped at Gilgal, and observed the Pesach on the fourteenth day of the month at erev in the plains of Yericho."
Yehoshua,5,11,"And they did eat of the produce of HaAretz on the day after the Pesach, on that very day, matzot, and roasted grain."
Yehoshua,5,12,And the manna ceased on the following day after they had eaten of the produce of HaAretz; neither had the Bnei Yisroel manna any more; but they did eat of the increase of Eretz Kena'an that year.
Yehoshua,5,13,"And it came to pass, when Yehoshua was there by Yericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, hinei, there stood an ish in front of him with his cherev drawn in his yad; and Yehoshua went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?"
Yehoshua,5,14,"And he said, Lo (no) ; but as Sar Tze'va Hashem am I now come. And Yehoshua fell on his face to the ground, and did prostrate himself, and said unto him, What saith Adoni unto his eved?"
Yehoshua,5,15,"And the Sar Tze'va Hashem said unto Yehoshua, Take off thy sandals from off thy feet; for the makom whereon thou standest is kodesh. And Yehoshua did so."
Yehoshua,6,1,"Now Yericho was closely shut up because of the Bnei Yisroel; none went out, and none came in."
Yehoshua,6,2,"And Hashem said unto Yehoshua, See, I have given into thine yad Yericho, and the melech thereof, and the gibborei hechayil."
Yehoshua,6,3,"And ye shall march around the Ir, all ye anshei hamilchamah, and go around the Ir once. Thus shalt thou do sheshet yamim."
Yehoshua,6,4,"And shivah Kohanim shall bear before the Aron shivah shoferot hayovelim; and the Yom HaShevi'i ye shall march around the Ir sheva times, and the Kohanim shall sound the shoferot."
Yehoshua,6,5,"And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with the keren hayovel, when ye hear the sound of the shofar, Kol HaAm shall shout with a teruah gedolah; and the Chomat HaIr shall fall down, and HaAm shall go up every ish charging straight in."
Yehoshua,6,6,"And Yehoshua ben Nun called the Kohanim, and said unto them, Take up the Aron HaBrit, and let shivah Kohanim bear shivah shoferot yovelim (seven ram-shofars) before the Aron Hashem."
Yehoshua,6,7,"And he ordered HaAm, Pass on, and march on the Ir, and let him that is armed pass on ahead of the Aron Hashem."
Yehoshua,6,8,"And it came to pass, when Yehoshua had spoken unto HaAm, that the shivah Kohanim bearing the shivah shoferot hayovelim passed on before Hashem , and sounded the shoferot; and the Aron Brit Hashem followed after them."
Yehoshua,6,9,"And the armed men marched ahead of the Kohanim that blew with the shoferot, and the rear guard came after the Aron, with the shoferot of the Kohanim going on sounding."
Yehoshua,6,10,"Yehoshua had commanded HaAm, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any davar proceed out of your mouth, until the Yom I tell you to shout; then shall ye shout."
Yehoshua,6,11,"So the Aron Hashem circled the Ir, going about it once; and they returned to the machaneh, and spent the night in the machaneh."
Yehoshua,6,12,"And Yehoshua rose early in the boker, and the Kohanim took up the Aron Hashem."
Yehoshua,6,13,"And shivah kohanim bearing shivah shoferot hayovelim before the Aron Hashem went on continually, and sounded the shoferot; and the armed men went before them; with the rearguard after the Aron Hashem , the Kohanim going on, and sounding the shoferot."
Yehoshua,6,14,"And the Yom HaSheni they circled the Ir once, and returned to the machaneh; so they did sheshet yamim."
Yehoshua,6,15,"And it came to pass on the Yom HaShevi'i, that they got up early about shachar, circled the Ir after the same manner sheva times; only on that Yom they marched around the Ir sheva pe'amim."
Yehoshua,6,16,"And it came to pass on the Shevi'it, when the Kohanim sounded the shoferot, Yehoshua said unto HaAm, Shout; for Hashem hath given you the Ir."
Yehoshua,6,17,"And the Ir shall be cherem, even it, and all that are therein, to Hashem ; only Rachav the zonah shall live, she and all that are with her in the bais, because she hid the malachim that we sent."
Yehoshua,6,18,"And ye, be shomer to keep yourselves from the cherem, lest ye make yourselves cherem, when ye take of the cherem, and make the Machaneh Yisroel cherem, and trouble it."
Yehoshua,6,19,"But all the kesef, zahav, and vessels of nechoshet and barzel, are kodesh unto Hashem ; they shall come into the Otzar Hashem."
Yehoshua,6,20,"So HaAm shouted when the Kohanim sounded the shoferot; and it came to pass, when HaAm heard the kol (sound) of the shofar, and HaAm shouted with a teruah gedolah, that the chomah fell down, so that HaAm went up into the Ir, every ish straight before him, and they took the Ir."
Yehoshua,6,21,"And they utterly destroyed all that was in the Ir, both ish and isha, na'ar and zaken, and shor, and seh, and chamor, with the edge of the cherev."
Yehoshua,6,22,"But Yehoshua had said unto the two anashim that had spied out HaAretz, Go into the bais haisha hazonah, and bring out from there the isha, and all that she hath, just as ye swore unto her."
Yehoshua,6,23,"And hane'arim (the young men) that were spies went in, and brought out Rachav, and her av, and her em, and her achim, and all that she had; and they brought out all her mishpechot, and put them outside the Machaneh Yisroel."
Yehoshua,6,24,"And they burned the Ir with eish, and all that was therein; only the kesef, and the zahav, and the vessels of nechoshet and of barzel (iron) , they put into the Otzar Bais Hashem."
Yehoshua,6,25,"And Yehoshua saved Rachav the zonah alive, and her Bais Avi, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Yisroel even unto this day; because she hid the malachim, which Yehoshua sent to spy out Yericho."
Yehoshua,6,26,"And Yehoshua made them take this shevu'ah, saying, Arur (cursed) be the ish before Hashem , that riseth up and rebuildeth this Ir Yericho; he shall lay the foundation thereof with his bechor, and with his tza'ir (youngest son) shall he set up the delatot (gates) thereof."
Yehoshua,6,27,So Hashem was with Yehoshua; and his fame was noised throughout kol HaAretz.
Yehoshua,7,1,"But the Bnei Yisroel broke faith in regard to the Cherem; for Achan ben Carmi ben Zavdi ben Zerach of the tribe of Yehudah, took of the Cherem (that which was devoted to destruction) ; and the Af Hashem was kindled against the Bnei Yisroel."
Yehoshua,7,2,"And Yehoshua sent anashim from Yericho to Ai, which is near Beit-Aven, on the east of Beit-El, speaking unto them, saying, Go up and spy out HaAretz. And the anashim went up and spied out Ai."
Yehoshua,7,3,"And they returned to Yehoshua, and said unto him, Let not Kol HaAm go up; but let about two or three thousand Ish go up and attack Ai; and weary not kol HaAm there; for they are but few."
Yehoshua,7,4,So there went up there of HaAm about three thousand Ish; and they fled before the anashim of Ai.
Yehoshua,7,5,"And the anashim of Ai struck down of them about thirty and six ish; for they chased them from before the sha'ar even unto Shevarim, and struck them down on the descent; therefore the levav HaAm melted, and became like mayim."
Yehoshua,7,6,"And Yehoshua tore his clothes, and fell to the ground upon his face before the Aron Hashem until erev, he and the Ziknei Yisroel, and they put dust upon their heads."
Yehoshua,7,7,"And Yehoshua said, Alas, Adonoi Hashem , why hast Thou at all brought HaAm Hazeh over the Yarden, to deliver us into the yad HaEmori, to destroy us? If only we had been content, and dwelt on the other side of the Yarden!"
Yehoshua,7,8,"O Adonoi, what shall I say, when Yisroel turneth their backs before their enemies!"
Yehoshua,7,9,"For the Kena'ani and all the inhabitants of HaAretz shall hear of it, and shall surround us, and cut off Shemeinu (our name) from HaAretz; and what wilt Thou do unto Thy Shem Hagadol?"
Yehoshua,7,10,"And Hashem said unto Yehoshua, Stand up; why liest thou thus upon thy face?"
Yehoshua,7,11,"Yisroel hath sinned, and they have also violated My Brit which I commanded them; for they have even taken of the Cherem, and have also played the ganav, and lied also, and they have put it even among their own possessions."
Yehoshua,7,12,"Therefore the Bnei Yisroel could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they are for Cherem; neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the Cherem from among you."
Yehoshua,7,13,"Up, set HaAm apart as kodesh, and say, Set yourselves apart as kodesh against tomorrow: for thus saith Hashem Elohei Yisroel, There is Cherem among you, O Yisroel; thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the Cherem from among you."
Yehoshua,7,14,"In the boker therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes; and it shall be, that the shevet (tribe) which Hashem taketh shall come near according to the mishpekhot thereof; and the mishpakhah which Hashem shall take shall come near by batim; and the bais which Hashem shall take shall come near man by man."
Yehoshua,7,15,"And it shall be, that he that is taken with the Cherem shall be burned with eish, he and all that he hath; because he hath violated the Brit Hashem , and because he hath wrought shame in Yisroel."
Yehoshua,7,16,"So Yehoshua rose up early in the boker, and brought Yisroel near by their tribes; and the Shevet Yehudah was taken;"
Yehoshua,7,17,And he brought the Mishpakhat Yehudah; and the Mishpakhat Zarchi was taken; and he brought the Mishpakhat HaZarchi man by man; and Zavdi was taken;
Yehoshua,7,18,"And he brought near his Bais man by man; and Achan ben Carmi ben Zavdi ben Zerach, of the tribe of Yehudah, was taken."
Yehoshua,7,19,"And Yehoshua said unto Achan, Beni (my son) , give, now, kavod to Hashem Elohei Yisroel, and give to Him todah; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me."
Yehoshua,7,20,"And Achan answered Yehoshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against Hashem Elohei Yisroel, and thus and thus have I done;"
Yehoshua,7,21,"When I saw among the plunder a beautiful robe of Shinar (Babylon) , and two hundred shekels of kesef, and a wedge of zahav of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, hinei, they are hid in ha'aretz in the midst of my ohel, and the kesef under it."
Yehoshua,7,22,"So Yehoshua sent malachim, and they ran unto the ohel; and, hinei, it was hid in his ohel, and the kesef under it!"
Yehoshua,7,23,"And they took them out of the midst of the ohel, and brought them unto Yehoshua, and unto all the Bnei Yisroel, and laid them out before Hashem."
Yehoshua,7,24,"And Yehoshua, and kol Yisroel with him, took Achan ben Zerach, and the kesef, and the robe, and the wedge of zahav, and his banim, and his banot, and his oxen, and his donkeys, and his tzon, and his ohel, and all that he had; and they brought them unto the Emek Achor (Valley of Trouble)."
Yehoshua,7,25,"And Yehoshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? Hashem shall trouble thee yom hazeh. And kol Yisroel stoned him with even (stones) , and burned them with eish, after they had stoned them with avanim (stones)."
Yehoshua,7,26,"And they raised over him a heap of avanim gadol unto this day. So Hashem turned from the fierceness of His Af (Anger) . Therefore the shem of that place was called, Emek Achor, unto this day."
Yehoshua,8,1,"And Hashem said unto Yehoshua, Fear not, neither be thou discouraged; take kol Am HaMilchamah with thee, and arise, go up to Ai; see, I have given into thy yad the melech HaAi, and his people, and his city, and his land;"
Yehoshua,8,2,"And thou shalt do to Ai and her melech just as thou didst unto Yericho and her melech; only the plunder thereof, and the livestock thereof, shall ye carry off for yourselves. Behind it set thee an ambush for the Ir (city) [of Ai]."
Yehoshua,8,3,"So Yehoshua arose, and kol Am HaMilchamah, to go up against Ai; and Yehoshua chose out shloshim elef ish gibborei hachayil, and sent them out by lailah."
Yehoshua,8,4,"And he commanded them, saying, See, ye shall set an ambush against the Ir, even behind the Ir; go not very far from the Ir, but be ye all nekhonim (ready, on alert, set, prepared);"
Yehoshua,8,5,"And I, and Kol HaAm that are with me, will approach unto the Ir; and it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the rishonah, that we will flee before them,"
Yehoshua,8,6," (For they will come out after us) until we have drawn them from the Ir; for they will say, They flee before us, just as at the rishonah; therefore we will flee before them."
Yehoshua,8,7,"Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the Ir; for Hashem Eloheichem will deliver it into your yad."
Yehoshua,8,8,"And it shall be, when ye have taken the Ir, that ye shall set eish to the Ir; according to the Davar Hashem shall ye do. See, I have commanded you."
Yehoshua,8,9,"Yehoshua therefore sent them forth; and they went to the place of ambush, and waited between Beit-El and Ai, on the west side of Ai; but Yehoshua spent that lailah among HaAm."
Yehoshua,8,10,"And Yehoshua rose up early in the boker, and mustered HaAm, and went up, he and the Ziknei Yisroel, before HaAm to Ai."
Yehoshua,8,11,"And Kol HaAm HaMilchamah that were with him, went up, and drew near, and came before the Ir, and encamped on the north side of Ai; now there was the gey (valley) between them and Ai."
Yehoshua,8,12,"And he took about chameshet alafim ish, and set them to lie in ambush between Beit-El and Ai, on the west side of the Ir."
Yehoshua,8,13,"And when they had set HaAm, even Kol HaMachaneh that was on the north of the Ir, and the ambush to the west of the Ir, Yehoshua went that lailah into the midst of the emek (valley)."
Yehoshua,8,14,"And it came to pass, when the melech of Ai saw it, that they hastened and rose up early, and the anshei HaIr went out against Yisroel in the milchamah, he and all his people, at the place, before the Aravah; but he had no da'as that there was an ambush against him set up behind the Ir."
Yehoshua,8,15,"And Yehoshua and kol Yisroel let themselves be driven before them, and fled by the derech hamidbar."
Yehoshua,8,16,"And kol HaAm that were in Ai were called together to pursue after them; and they pursued after Yehoshua, and were lured from the Ir."
Yehoshua,8,17,"And there was not an ish left in Ai or Beit-El, that went not out after Yisroel; and they left the Ir open, and pursued after Yisroel."
Yehoshua,8,18,"And Hashem said unto Yehoshua, Stretch out the kidon (javelin) that is in thy yad toward Ai; for I will give it into thine yad. And Yehoshua stretched out the kidon that he had in his yad toward the Ir."
Yehoshua,8,19,"And the ambush arose quickly out of their makom, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his yad; and they entered into the Ir, and took it, and hastened and set eish to the Ir."
Yehoshua,8,20,"And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, hinei, the ashan HaIr (smoke of the city) ascended up to Shomayim, and they had no way to flee here or there; and HaAm that fled to the midbar turned back upon the pursuers."
Yehoshua,8,21,"And when Yehoshua and kol Yisroel saw that the ambush had taken the Ir, and that the ashan HaIr ascended, then they turned again, and attacked the anshei HaAi."
Yehoshua,8,22,"Then these came out of the Ir against them; so they were in the midst of Yisroel, some on this side, and some on that side; and they struck them down, until they left none of them sarid (remnant, survivor) or palit (refugee, fugitive)."
Yehoshua,8,23,"And the melech HaAi (literally, the King of Ruin) they took alive, and brought him to Yehoshua."
Yehoshua,8,24,"And it came to pass, when Yisroel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the sadeh, in the midbar wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the cherev, until they were consumed, that kol Yisroel returned unto Ai, and struck it with the edge of the cherev."
Yehoshua,8,25,"And so it was, that all that fell that yom, both of ish and isha, were sheneym asar elef, even kol anshei HaAi."
Yehoshua,8,26,"For Yehoshua drew not his yad back, wherewith he stretched out the kidon, until he had utterly destroyed kol yoshvei HaAi."
Yehoshua,8,27,"Only the behemah and the plunder of that Ir Yisroel carried off for themselves, according to the Davar Hashem which He commanded Yehoshua."
Yehoshua,8,28,"And Yehoshua burned Ai, and made it a tel olam (heap forever) , even a desolation unto yom hazeh."
Yehoshua,8,29,"And the melech HaAi he hanged on HaEtz until the time of erev; and as soon as the shemesh was down, Yehoshua commanded that they should take his nevelah (body) down from HaEtz, and cast it at the petach sha'ar HaIr, and raised thereon a pile of avanim, that remaineth unto Yom Hazeh."
Yehoshua,8,30,"Then Yehoshua built a Mizbe'ach unto Hashem Elohei Yisroel in Har Eival,"
Yehoshua,8,31,"Just as Moshe Eved Hashem commanded the Bnei Yisroel, as it is written in the Sefer Torah Moshe, a Mizbe'ach avanim shelemot, over which no man hath lift up any barzel (iron) ; and they offered thereon olot unto Hashem , and sacrificed shelamim."
Yehoshua,8,32,"And he wrote there upon the avanim a mishneh (copy) Torat Moshe, which he wrote in the presence of the Bnei Yisroel."
Yehoshua,8,33,"And Kol Yisroel, and their Zekenim, and shoterim, and their shofetim, stood on this side the Aron and on that side facing the Kohanim the Levi'im, which bore the Aron Brit Hashem , as well the ger as the ezrach (he that was born among them) ; half of them over against Har Gerizim, and half of them over against Har Eival; just as Moshe Eved Hashem had commanded before, in connection with the blessing of HaAm Yisroel."
Yehoshua,8,34,"And afterward he read kol divrei HaTorah, the brocha and kelalah, according to all that is written in the Sefer HaTorah."
Yehoshua,8,35,"There was not a davar of all that Moshe commanded, which Yehoshua read not before kol Kehal Yisroel, with the nashim, and the little ones, and the ger that were living among them."
Yehoshua,9,1,"And it came to pass, when kol hamelachim which were beyond the Yarden, in the har, and in the Shefelah, and in all the coasts of the Yam Hagadol over against the Levanon, the Chitti, and HaEmori, the Kena'ani, the Perizzi, the Chivi, and the Yevusi, heard thereof;"
Yehoshua,9,2,"That they gathered themselves together, to make war with Yehoshua and with Yisroel, with one peh (mouth)."
Yehoshua,9,3,"And when the inhabitants of Giv'on heard what Yehoshua had done unto Yericho and to Ai,"
Yehoshua,9,4,"They did work in a cunning, crafty manner, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sakkim (sacks) upon their donkeys, and skins of yayin, old, and cracked, and mended;"
Yehoshua,9,5,"And sandals old and patched upon their feet, and selamot ballot (old garments) upon them; and all the lechem of their food supply was dry and moldy."
Yehoshua,9,6,"And they went to Yehoshua unto the machaneh at Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the Ish Yisroel, We are come from an eretz rechokah (far country) ; now therefore cut ye a brit with us."
Yehoshua,9,7,"And the Ish Yisroel said unto the Chivi (Hivites) , Perhaps ye dwell among us; how then shall we cut a brit with you?"
Yehoshua,9,8,"And they said unto Yehoshua, We are thy avadim. And Yehoshua said unto them, Who are ye? And from where do ye come?"
Yehoshua,9,9,"And they said unto him, From an eretz rechokah me'od thy avadim are come because of the Shem of Hashem Eloheicha; for we have heard the report of Him, and all that He did in Mitzrayim,"
Yehoshua,9,10,"And all that He did to the two melachim of HaEmori, that were beyond the Yarden, to Sichon Melech Cheshbon, and to Og Melech HaBashan, which was at Ashtarot."
Yehoshua,9,11,"Therefore Zekeinenu and all the inhabitants of Artzeinu spoke to us, saying, Take food supplies with you for the derech, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We are your avadim; therefore now cut ye a brit with us."
Yehoshua,9,12,"This our lechem we packed cham (hot) for our provision out of our batim (houses) on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, hinei, it is dry, and it is moldy;"
Yehoshua,9,13,"And these skins of yayin, which we filled, were chadashim; and, hinei, they are cracked; and these our garments and our sandals are become worn out by reason of the derech me'od."
Yehoshua,9,14,"And the anashim took of their food supplies, and asked not counsel at the pi Hashem (mouth of Hashem)."
Yehoshua,9,15,"And Yehoshua made shalom with them, and cut a brit with them, to let them live; and the Nasi'im of the Edah so ratified by oath unto them."
Yehoshua,9,16,"And it came to pass at the end of shloshet yamim after they had cut a brit with them, that they heard that they were their kerovim (neighbors) , and that they dwelt near them."
Yehoshua,9,17,"And the Bnei Yisroel journeyed, and came unto their towns on the yom hashelishi. Now their towns were Giv'on, and Kephirah, and Be'erot, and Kiryat-Ye'arim."
Yehoshua,9,18,"And the Bnei Yisroel did not strike them down, because the Nasi'im of the Edah had sworn unto them by Hashem Elohei Yisroel. And Kol HaEdah murmured against the Nasi'im."
Yehoshua,9,19,"But all the Nasi'im said unto Kol HaEdah, We have sworn unto them by Hashem Elohei Yisroel; now therefore we may not touch them."
Yehoshua,9,20,"This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest ketzef (wrath) be upon us, because of the shevu'ah (oath) which we swore unto them."
Yehoshua,9,21,"And the Nasi'im said unto them, Let them live; but let them be woodcutters and water carriers unto Kol HaEdah; as the Nasi'im had promised them."
Yehoshua,9,22,"And Yehoshua called for them, and he spoke unto them, saying, Why have ye beguiled us, saying, Rechokim anachnu from you when ye dwell near us?"
Yehoshua,9,23,"Now therefore ye are arurim, and there shall none of you be yikaret (be cut off) from being eved, and woodcutters and water carriers for the Bais Elohai."
Yehoshua,9,24,"And they answered Yehoshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy avadim, how that Hashem Eloheicha commanded His Eved Moshe to give you kol HaAretz, and to destroy all the inhabitants of HaAretz from before you, therefore we were greatly afraid for nafshoteinu because of you, so we have done this thing."
Yehoshua,9,25,"And now, behold, we are in thine yad; as it seemeth tov and yashar unto thee to do unto us, do."
Yehoshua,9,26,"And so did he unto them, and saved them out of the yad of the Bnei Yisroel, that they slaughtered them not."
Yehoshua,9,27,"And Yehoshua made them that day woodcutters and water carriers for the Edah, and for the Mizbe'ach of Hashem , even unto this day, in the makom which He would choose."
Yehoshua,10,1,"Now it came to pass, when Adoni-Tzedek Melech Yerushalayim had heard how Yehoshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; just as he had done to Yericho and its melech, so he had done to Ai and its melech; and how the inhabitants of Giv'on had made terms of shalom with Yisroel, and were near them;"
Yehoshua,10,2,"That they feared greatly, because Giv'on was an ir gedolah, like one of the royal cities, and because it was larger than Ai, and all the men thereof were gibborim."
Yehoshua,10,3,"Therefore Adoni-Tzedek Melech Yerushalayim, sent unto Hoham Melech Chevron, and unto Piram Melech Yarmut, and unto Yaphia Melech Lakhish, and unto Devir Melech Eglon, saying,"
Yehoshua,10,4,"Come up unto me, and help me, that we may attack Giv'on; for it hath made terms of shalom with Yehoshua and with the Bnei Yisroel."
Yehoshua,10,5,"Therefore the five kings of HaEmori, the Melech Yerushalayim, the Melech Chevron, the Melech Yarmut, the Melech Lakhish, the Melech Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their machanot, and encamped before Giv'on, and made war against it."
Yehoshua,10,6,"And the anshei Giv'on sent unto Yehoshua to the machaneh at Gilgal, saying, Abandon not thy yad from thy avadim; come up to us quickly, save us, help us; for all the melachim of HaEmori that dwell in the har are gathered together against us."
Yehoshua,10,7,"So Yehoshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and kol Am HaMilchamah with him, and kol gibborei hachayil."
Yehoshua,10,8,"And Hashem said unto Yehoshua, Fear them not; for I have delivered them into thine yad; there shall not an ish of them stand before thee."
Yehoshua,10,9,"Yehoshua therefore came unto them pitom, and went up from Gilgal kol halailah."
Yehoshua,10,10,"And Hashem threw them into confusion before Yisroel, and struck them with a makkah gedolah at Giv'on, and pursued them along the derech that goeth up to Beit-Choron, and cut them down to Azekah, and to Makkedah."
Yehoshua,10,11,"And it came to pass, as they fled from before Yisroel, and were in the going down to Beit-Choron, that Hashem cast down avanim gedolot from Shomayim upon them unto Azekah, and they died; they were more which died with avnei habarad (hail-stones) than they whom the Bnei Yisroel slaughtered with the cherev."
Yehoshua,10,12,"Then spoke Yehoshua to Hashem in the day when Hashem delivered up HaEmori before the Bnei Yisroel, and he said in the sight of Yisroel, Shemesh, stand thou still upon Giv'on; and thou, Yarei'ach, in the Emek Ayalon."
Yehoshua,10,13,"And the shemesh stood still, the yarei'ach stopped, until the Goy had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the Sefer HaYasher? So the shemesh stood still in the middle of Shomayim, and hastened not to go down about a yom tamim (whole day)."
Yehoshua,10,14,"And there was no day like that before it or after it, that Hashem paid heed unto the voice of an ish; for Hashem fought for Yisroel."
Yehoshua,10,15,"And Yehoshua returned, and kol Yisroel with him, unto the machaneh at Gilgal."
Yehoshua,10,16,"But these five melachim fled, and hid themselves in a me'arah (cave) at Makkedah."
Yehoshua,10,17,"And it was told Yehoshua, saying, The five melachim are found hiding in a me'arah at Makkedah."
Yehoshua,10,18,"And Yehoshua said, Roll avanim gedolot upon the mouth of the me'arah, and post anashim by it to be shomer over them;"
Yehoshua,10,19,"And stop ye not, but pursue after your enemies, and attack them; allow them not to enter into their towns; for Hashem Eloheichem hath delivered them into your yad."
Yehoshua,10,20,"And it came to pass, when Yehoshua and the Bnei Yisroel had made an end of striking them with a makkah gedolah me'od, until they were consumed, that the rest which remained of them entered into fortified cities."
Yehoshua,10,21,And kol HaAm returned to the machaneh to Yehoshua at Makkedah in shalom; none moved his tongue against any of the Bnei Yisroel.
Yehoshua,10,22,"Then said Yehoshua, Open the mouth of the me'arah, and bring out those five melachim unto me out of the me'arah."
Yehoshua,10,23,"And they did so, and brought forth those five melachim unto him out of the me'arah, Melech Yerushalayim, Melech Chevron, Melech Yarmut, Melech Lakhish, and Melech Eglon."
Yehoshua,10,24,"And it came to pass, when they brought out those melachim unto Yehoshua, that Yehoshua called for kol Ish Yisroel, and said unto the Ketzinei Anshei HaMilchamah which went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these melachim. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them."
Yehoshua,10,25,"And Yehoshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be discouraged, be strong and of good courage; for thus shall Hashem do to all your enemies against whom ye fight."
Yehoshua,10,26,"And afterward Yehoshua struck them down, and slaughtered them, and hanged them on chamishah etzim; and they were hanging upon the etzim until the erev."
Yehoshua,10,27,"And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the shemesh, that Yehoshua commanded, and they took them down off the etzim, cast them into the me'arah wherein they had been hiding, and laid avanim gedolot on the mouth of the me'arah, which remain until this very day."
Yehoshua,10,28,"And that day Yehoshua took Makkedah, and struck it down with the edge of the cherev, and the Melech thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and every nefesh that was therein; he let none remain; and he did to the Melech of Makkedah as he did unto the Melech of Yericho."
Yehoshua,10,29,"Then Yehoshua passed from Makkedah, and kol Yisroel with him, unto Livnah, and fought against Livnah;"
Yehoshua,10,30,"And Hashem delivered it also, and the melech thereof, into the yad Yisroel; and he struck it down with the edge of the cherev, and kol hanefesh therein; he let none remain in it; but did unto the melech thereof as he did unto the melech of Yericho."
Yehoshua,10,31,"And Yehoshua passed from Livnah, and kol Yisroel with him, unto Lakhish, and encamped against it, and fought against it;"
Yehoshua,10,32,"And Hashem delivered Lakhish into the yad Yisroel, which took it on the yom hasheni, and struck it down with the edge of the cherev, and kol hanefesh therein, according to all that he had done to Livnah."
Yehoshua,10,33,"Then Horam Melech Gezer came up to help Lakhish; and Yehoshua struck him down and his army, until he had left him none remaining."
Yehoshua,10,34,"And from Lakhish, Yehoshua passed unto Eglon, and kol Yisroel with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it;"
Yehoshua,10,35,"And they took it on that day, and struck it down with the edge of the cherev, and kol hanefesh therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lakhish."
Yehoshua,10,36,"And Yehoshua went up from Eglon, and kol Yisroel with him, unto Chevron; and they fought against it;"
Yehoshua,10,37,"And they took it, and struck it down with the edge of the cherev, and the melech thereof, and all the towns thereof, and kol hanefesh therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and kol hanefesh therein."
Yehoshua,10,38,"And Yehoshua returned, and kol Yisroel with him, to Devir; and fought against it;"
Yehoshua,10,39,"And he took it, and the melech thereof, and all the towns thereof; and they struck them down with the edge of the cherev, and utterly destroyed kol nefesh therein; he left none remaining; as he had done to Chevron, so he did to Devir, and to the melech thereof; as he had done also to Livnah, and to its melech."
Yehoshua,10,40,"So Yehoshua subdued kol HaAretz HaHar, and of the Negev, and of the Shefelah, and of the asedot (slopes) , and all their melachim; he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed kol haneshamah, as Hashem Elohei Yisroel commanded."
Yehoshua,10,41,"And Yehoshua struck them down from Kadesh-Barnea even unto Azah (Gaza) , and all the country of Goshen, even unto Giv'on."
Yehoshua,10,42,"And all these melachim and their land did Yehoshua take at one time, because Hashem Elohei Yisroel fought for Yisroel."
Yehoshua,10,43,"And Yehoshua returned, and kol Yisroel with him, unto the machaneh at Gilgal."
Yehoshua,11,1,"And it came to pass, when Yavin Melech Chatzor had heard those things, that he sent to Yovav Melech Madon, to the Melech Shimron, and to the Melech Akhshaph,"
Yehoshua,11,2,"And to the melachim to the north, in the har, and the Aravah south of Kinnerot, and in the Shefelah, and in the regions of Dor on the west,"
Yehoshua,11,3,"And to the Kena'ani on the east and on the west, and to Emori, and the Chitti, and the Perizzi, and the Yevusi in the har, and to the Chivi at the base of Chermon in Eretz HaMitzpah."
Yehoshua,11,4,"And they went out, they and all their machanot with them, am rav, even as the sand that is upon the sea in multitude, with susim and chariots rav me'od."
Yehoshua,11,5,"And when all these melachim were met together, they came to encamp together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Yisroel."
Yehoshua,11,6,"And Hashem said unto Yehoshua, Be not afraid before them; for machar about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Yisroel; thou shalt lame their susim, and burn their merkevot with eish."
Yehoshua,11,7,"So Yehoshua, kol Am HaMilchamah with him, came against them by the waters of Merom pitom (suddenly) ; and they fell upon them."
Yehoshua,11,8,"And Hashem delivered them into the yad Yisroel, who struck them down, and pursued them unto Tzidon Rabbah, and unto Misrephot-Mayim, and unto the Valley of Mitzpeh eastward; and they struck them down, until they left them none sarid (remaining)."
Yehoshua,11,9,"And Yehoshua did unto them just as Hashem directed him; he lamed their susim, and burned their merkevot with eish."
Yehoshua,11,10,"And Yehoshua at that time turned back, and took Chatzor, and struck down the melech thereof with the cherev; for Chatzor formerly had been the rosh kol hamamlachot haelleh."
Yehoshua,11,11,"And they struck down kol hanefesh that were therein with the edge of the cherev, utterly destroying them; there was not left kol neshamah; and with eish he burned Chatzor."
Yehoshua,11,12,"And all the towns of those melachim, and all the melachim of them, did Yehoshua take, and struck them down with the edge of the cherev, and he utterly destroyed them, just as Moshe Eved Hashem commanded."
Yehoshua,11,13,"But as for the towns that stood on their tel (mound, old site) , Yisroel burned none of them, except Chatzor only; that did Yehoshua burn."
Yehoshua,11,14,"And all the plunder of these towns, and the behemah, the Bnei Yisroel carried off for themselves; but kol haAdam they struck down with the edge of the cherev, until they had destroyed them, neither left they kol neshamah."
Yehoshua,11,15,"Just as Hashem commanded Moshe His Eved, so did Moshe command Yehoshua, and so did Yehoshua; he left nothing undone of all that Hashem commanded Moshe."
Yehoshua,11,16,"So Yehoshua took kol HaAretz hazot, the har, and kol haNegev, and kol Eretz HaGoshen, and the Shefelah, and the Aravah, and the har Yisroel, and Shefelah;"
Yehoshua,11,17,"Even from the Har HeChalak, that goeth up to Se'ir, even unto Ba'al-Gad in the valley of the Levanon under Mt Chermon; and all their melachim he took, and struck them down, and slaughtered them."
Yehoshua,11,18,Yehoshua made milchamah yamim rabbim with all those melachim.
Yehoshua,11,19,"There was not an ir that made terms of shalom with the Bnei Yisroel, except Chivi the inhabitants of Giv'on; all others they took in milchamah."
Yehoshua,11,20,"For it was of Hashem to harden their hearts, that they should come against Yisroel in milchamah, that he might destroy them utterly, that there might be to them no techinnah (mercy plea) , but that he might destroy them, just as Hashem commanded Moshe."
Yehoshua,11,21,"And at that time came Yehoshua, and cut off the Anakim from the har, from Chevron, from Devir, from Anav, from kol har Yehudah, from kol har Yisroel; Yehoshua destroyed them utterly with their towns."
Yehoshua,11,22,"There were none of the Anakim left in the Eretz Bnei Yisroel; only in Azah (Gaza) , in Gat, and in Ashdod, there remained."
Yehoshua,11,23,"So Yehoshua took Kol HaAretz, according to all that Hashem said unto Moshe; and Yehoshua gave it for a nachalah unto Yisroel according to their divisions by their shevatim. And HaAretz rested from milchamah."
Yehoshua,12,1,"Now these are the melachim HaAretz, which the Bnei Yisroel conquered, and possessed their land beyond the Yarden toward the rising of the shemesh, from the Arnon Valley unto Mt Chermon, and kol HaAravah on the east;"
Yehoshua,12,2,"Sichon Melech HaEmori, who reigned in Cheshbon, and ruled from Aro'er, which is upon the rim of the Arnon Valley, and from the middle of the valley, and from half Gil'ad, even unto the River Yabbok, which is the border of the Bnei Ammon;"
Yehoshua,12,3,"And from the Aravah to the Yam Kinnerot on the east, and unto the Yam HaAravah, even the Yam HaMelach on the east, derech to Beit-HaYeshimot; and from the south, below Ashdot-HaPisgah;"
Yehoshua,12,4,"And the territory of Og Melech HaBashan, from the last of the Repha'im, that reigned at Ashtarot and at Edre'i,"
Yehoshua,12,5,"And reigned in Mt Chermon, and in Salkhah, and in kol HaBashan, unto the border of the Geshuri and the Ma'akhati, and half Gil'ad, the border of Sichon Melech Cheshbon."
Yehoshua,12,6,"These did Moshe Eved Hashem and the Bnei Yisroel conquer; and Moshe Eved Hashem gave it for a possession unto the Reuveni, and the Gadi, and the half shevet HaMenasheh."
Yehoshua,12,7,"And these are the melachim of HaAretz which Yehoshua and the Bnei Yisroel conquered on the west side of the Yarden, from Ba'al-Gad in the valley of Levanon even unto the Har HeChalak, that goeth up to Se'ir; which Yehoshua gave unto the Shivtei Yisroel for a yerushah (possession) according to their divisions;"
Yehoshua,12,8,"In the har, and in the Shefelah, and in the Aravah, and in the slopes, and in the midbar, and in the Negev; the Chitti, HaEmori, and the Kena'ani, the Perizzi, the Chivi, and the Yevusi;"
Yehoshua,12,9,"The Melech Yericho, one; the Melech Ai, which is near Beit-El, one;"
Yehoshua,12,10,"The Melech Yerushalayim, one; the Melech Chevron, one;"
Yehoshua,12,11,"The Melech Yarmut, one; the Melech Lakhish, one;"
Yehoshua,12,12,"The Melech Eglon, one; the Melech Gezer, one;"
Yehoshua,12,13,"The Melech Devir, one; the Melech Geder, one;"
Yehoshua,12,14,"The Melech Chormah, one; the Melech Arad, one;"
Yehoshua,12,15,"The Melech Livnah, one; the Melech Adullam, one;"
Yehoshua,12,16,"The Melech Makkedah, one; the Melech Beit-El, one;"
Yehoshua,12,17,"The Melech Tapuach, one; the Melech Chepher, one;"
Yehoshua,12,18,"The Melech Aphek, one; the Melech Lasharon, one;"
Yehoshua,12,19,"The Melech Madon, one; the Melech Chatzor, one;"
Yehoshua,12,20,"The Melech Shimron-Meron, one; the Melech Akhshaph, one;"
Yehoshua,12,21,"The Melech Ta'nakh, one; the Melech Megiddo, one;"
Yehoshua,12,22,"The Melech Kedesh, one; the Melech Yokne'am in Carmel, one;"
Yehoshua,12,23,"The Melech Dor in the heights of Dor, one; the Melech Goyim of Gilgal, one;"
Yehoshua,12,24,"The Melech Tirtzah, one: kol melachim sheloshim v'echad."
Yehoshua,13,1,"Now Yehoshua was zaken, advanced in yamim; Hashem said unto him, Thou art old, advanced in yamim; HaAretz there remaineth yet harebbeh me'od to be possessed."
Yehoshua,13,2,"This is HaAretz that yet remaineth; all the regions of the Pelishtim, and all Geshuri,"
Yehoshua,13,3,"From Sichor, which is before Mitzrayim, even unto the territory of Ekron northward, which is counted to the Kena'ani; five rulers of the Pelishtim; the Azzati, the Ashdodi, the Ashkeloni, the Gitti, the Ekroni; also the Avim;"
Yehoshua,13,4,"From the south, all the Eretz HaKena'ani, and from Arah that belongs to the Tzidonim unto Aphek, to the region of HaEmori;"
Yehoshua,13,5,"And the area of the Byblos, and all the Levanon, toward the rising of the shemesh, from Ba'al-Gad under Mt Chermon unto Levo Chamat."
Yehoshua,13,6,"All the inhabitants of the har from the Levanon unto Misrephot-Mayim, and all the Tzidonim, them will I drive out from before the Bnei Yisroel; only divide thou it by lot unto Yisroel for a nachalah, as I have commanded thee."
Yehoshua,13,7,"Now therefore divide HaAretz Hazot for a nachalah unto the nine Shevatim, and the half tribe of Menasheh,"
Yehoshua,13,8,"With whom the Reuveni and the Gadi have received their nachalah, which Moshe gave them, beyond Yarden eastward, even as Moshe Eved Hashem gave them;"
Yehoshua,13,9,"From Aro'er, that is upon the rim of the Arnon Valley, and the town that is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain of Medeva unto Divon;"
Yehoshua,13,10,"And all the towns of Sichon Melech HaEmori, which reigned in Cheshbon, unto the border of the Bnei Ammon;"
Yehoshua,13,11,"And Gil'ad, and the territory of the Geshuri and Ma'akhati, and all Mt Chermon, and all Bashan as far as Salkhah;"
Yehoshua,13,12,"All the Mamlechut Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtarot and in Edre'i, who remained of the remnant of Repha'im; for these did Moshe conquer, and dispossessed them."
Yehoshua,13,13,"Nevertheless the Bnei Yisroel dispossessed not the Geshuri, nor the Ma'akhati; but the Geshuri and the Maachati dwell among Yisroel until this day."
Yehoshua,13,14,"Only unto the shevet HaLevi he gave no nachalah; the sacrifices made by eish of Hashem Elohei Yisroel are their nachalah, as He said unto them."
Yehoshua,13,15,And Moshe gave unto the tribe of the Bnei Reuven according to their mishpekhot;
Yehoshua,13,16,"Territory to them from Aro'er, that is on the rim of the Arnon Valley, and the town that is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain past Medeva;"
Yehoshua,13,17,"Cheshbon, and all its towns that are in the plain; Divon, and Bamot-Ba'al, and Beit-Ba'al Me'on,"
Yehoshua,13,18,"And Yahtzah, and Kedemot, and Mepha'at,"
Yehoshua,13,19,"And Kiryatayim, and Sivmah, and Tzeret-HaShachar on the har in the valley,"
Yehoshua,13,20,"And Beit-Pe'or, and slopes of Pisgah, and Beit-HaYeshimot,"
Yehoshua,13,21,"And all the towns of the plain, and kol mamlechot Shichon Melech HaEmori, who reigned in Cheshbon, whom Moshe conquered with the nasiim of Midyan, Evi, and Rekem, and Tzur, and Chur, and Reva, which were vassal princes under Sichon, dwelling in HaAretz."
Yehoshua,13,22,"Also Balaam ben Be'or, the kosem (soothsayer, practicer of divination) , did the Bnei Yisroel put to death with the cherev among them that were slain by them."
Yehoshua,13,23,"And the boundary of the Bnei Reuven was the Yarden, and the bank thereof. This was the nachalat Bnei Reuven after their mishpekhot, the towns and villages thereof."
Yehoshua,13,24,"And Moshe gave unto the tribe of Gad, even unto the Bnei Gad according to their mishpekhot;"
Yehoshua,13,25,"Territory to them, Yazer, and all the towns of Gil'ad, and half the Eretz Bnei Ammon, as far as Aro'er that is near Rabbah;"
Yehoshua,13,26,"And from Cheshbon unto Ramat HaMitzpeh, and Betonim; and from Machanayim unto the territory of Devir;"
Yehoshua,13,27,"And in the valley, Beit-Haram, and Beit-Nimrah, and Sukkot, and Tzaphon, the rest of the Mamlechot Sichon Melech Cheshbon, the Yarden and its territory, even unto the end of the Yam Kinneret on the other side of the Yarden eastward."
Yehoshua,13,28,"This is the nachalah of the Bnei Gad after their mishpekhot, the towns, and their villages."
Yehoshua,13,29,And Moshe gave unto the half tribe of Menasheh; and this was the possession of the half tribe of the Bnei Menasheh by their mishpekhot.
Yehoshua,13,30,"Their territory was from Machanayim, all Bashan, kol Mamlechot Og Melech HaBashan, and all the towns of Yair, which are in Bashan, shishim ir;"
Yehoshua,13,31,"And half Gil'ad, and Ashtarot, and Edre'i, towns of the Mamlechot Og in Bashan, were pertaining unto the Bnei Machir ben Menasheh, even to the one half of the Bnei Machir by their mishpekhot."
Yehoshua,13,32,"These which Moshe did distribute for nachalah in the plains of Moav, on the other side of the Yarden, by Yericho, eastward."
Yehoshua,13,33,"But unto the Shevet HaLevi Moshe gave not any nachalah; Hashem Elohei Yisroel was their nachalah, as He said unto them."
Yehoshua,14,1,"And these are that which the Bnei Yisroel inherited in Eretz Kena'an, which El'azar HaKohen, and Yehoshua ben Nun, and the Roshei Avot of the tribes of the Bnei Yisroel, distributed for nachalah to them."
Yehoshua,14,2,"By goral (lot) was their nachalah, just as Hashem commanded by the yad Moshe, for the nine tribes, and for the half-tribe."
Yehoshua,14,3,For Moshe had given the nachalah of two and a half tribes on the other side of the Yarden; but unto the Levi'im he gave no nachalah among them.
Yehoshua,14,4,"For the Bnei Yosef were two tribes, Menasheh and Ephrayim; therefore they gave no chelek unto the Levi'im in HaAretz, except arim (cities) to dwell in, with their open land for their livestock and for their herds."
Yehoshua,14,5,"Just as Hashem commanded Moshe, so the Bnei Yisroel did, and they divided HaAretz."
Yehoshua,14,6,"Then the Bnei Yehudah came unto Yehoshua in Gilgal; and Kalev ben Yephunneh the Kenizi said unto him, Thou knowest the thing that Hashem said unto Moshe Ish HaElohim concerning me and thee in Kadesh-Barnea."
Yehoshua,14,7,I was forty years old when Moshe Eved Hashem sent me from Kadesh-Barnea to spy out HaAretz; and I brought him back davar just as it was in my lev.
Yehoshua,14,8,Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the lev of HaAm melt; but I wholly followed after Hashem Elohai.
Yehoshua,14,9,"And Moshe swore on that day, saying, Surely HaAretz whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine nachalah, and that of thy banim ad olam, because thou hast wholly followed after Hashem Elohai."
Yehoshua,14,10,"And now, hinei, Hashem hath kept me alive, just as He said, these forty and five shanah, even since Hashem spoke this word unto Moshe, while the Bnei Yisroel wandered in the midbar; and now, hinei, I am this day fourscore and five shanah."
Yehoshua,14,11,"As yet I am chazak, as strong this day as I was in the day that Moshe sent me; as my koach was then, even so is my koach now, for milchamah, both to go out, and to come in."
Yehoshua,14,12,"Now therefore give me hahar hazeh (this mountain) , whereof Hashem spoke in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakim were there, and that the cities were gedolot and fortified; but, Hashem with me, I shall be able to drive them out, just as Hashem said."
Yehoshua,14,13,"And Yehoshua put a bracha on him, and gave unto Kalev ben Yephunneh Chevron for a nachalah."
Yehoshua,14,14,"Chevron therefore became the nachalah of Kalev ben Yephunneh the Kenizi unto this day, because that he wholly followed Hashem Elohei Yisroel."
Yehoshua,14,15,And the shem of Chevron before was Kiryat-Arba; which Arba was ha'adam hagedol among the Anakim. And HaAretz had rest from milchamah.
Yehoshua,15,1,"This then was the goral (lot) of the tribe of the Bnei Yehudah by their mishpekhot; even to the territory of Edom, to the midbar of Tzin toward the Negev in the extreme south."
Yehoshua,15,2,"And their southern boundary was from the shore of the Yam HaMelach, from the bay that looketh southward;"
Yehoshua,15,3,"And it went out to the south side to Ma'aleh Akrabbim, passed along to Tzin, ascended up on the south side unto Kadesh-Barnea, passed along to Chetzron, went up to Addar, and turned toward Karka;"
Yehoshua,15,4,"From there it passed toward Atzmon, and went out unto the Wadi Mitzrayim; and the boundary ended at the Yam; this shall be your south border."
Yehoshua,15,5,"And the east boundary is the Yam HaMelach, even unto the mouth of the Yarden. And their boundary in the north quarter was from the bay of the Yam at the mouth of the Yarden;"
Yehoshua,15,6,"And the boundary went up to Beit-Choglah, and passed along by the north of Beit-Aravah; and the boundary went up to the Even Bohan ben Reuven;"
Yehoshua,15,7,"And the boundary went up toward Devir from the Achor Valley, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, which faces Ma'aleh-Adummim, which is on the south side of the wadi; and the boundary passed toward the Ein Shemesh Spring, and ended at Ein-Rogel;"
Yehoshua,15,8,"And the boundary went up by Ben Hinnom Valley unto the slope of the Yevusi (that is, Yerushalayim) ; and the boundary went up to the top of the har that is before the Hinnom Valley westward, which is at the end of the Repha'im Valley northward;"
Yehoshua,15,9,"From the top of the har the boundary ran unto the source of Nephtoach Spring, and went out to the towns of Har Ephron; and the boundary went to Ba'alah (that is, Kiryat-Ye'arim);"
Yehoshua,15,10,"And the boundary curved from Ba'alah westward unto Mt Se'ir, and ran along unto the slope of Mt Yearim (that is, Kesalon) , on the north side, and went down to Beit-Shemesh, and passed on to Timnah;"
Yehoshua,15,11,"And the boundary went out unto the side of Ekron northward; and the boundary ran over to Shikkaron, and passed along to Mt Ba'alah, and went out unto Yavne'el; and the boundary ended at the Yam."
Yehoshua,15,12,"And the western boundary is HaYamah HaGadol, and the coast thereof. This is the boundary around the Bnei Yehudah according to their mishpekhot."
Yehoshua,15,13,"And unto Kalev ben Yephunneh he gave chelek among the Bnei Yehudah, according to the commandment of Hashem to Yehoshua, even Kiryat-Arba (avi HaAnak) , which is Chevron."
Yehoshua,15,14,"And Kalev drove from there the three Bnei Anak: Sheshai and Achiman and Talmai, the descendants of Anak."
Yehoshua,15,15,And he went up from there to the inhabitants of Devir; and the shem of Devir formerly was Kiryat-Sepher.
Yehoshua,15,16,"And Kalev said, He that strikes down Kiryat-Sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my bat as isha."
Yehoshua,15,17,"And Otniel ben Kenaz, the brother of Kalev, took it; and he gave him Achsah his bat as isha."
Yehoshua,15,18,"And it came to pass, as she came unto him, that she urged him to ask of her av a sadeh; and she got off her chamor; and Kalev said unto her, What wouldest thou?"
Yehoshua,15,19,"She answered, Give me a brocha; for thou hast given me eretz HaNegev; give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs, and the lower springs."
Yehoshua,15,20,This is the nachalah of the tribe of the Bnei Yehudah according to their mishpekhot.
Yehoshua,15,21,"And the towns at the extremity of the tribe of the Bnei Yehudah toward the boundary of Edom southward were Kavtze'el, and Eder, and Yagur,"
Yehoshua,15,22,"And Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah,"
Yehoshua,15,23,"And Kedesh, and Chatzor, and Yitnan,"
Yehoshua,15,24,"Ziph, and Telem, and Be'alot,"
Yehoshua,15,25,"And Chatzor, Chadattah, and Keriyot, and Chetzron, which is Chatzor,"
Yehoshua,15,26,"Amam, and Shema, and Moladah,"
Yehoshua,15,27,"And Chatzar Gaddah, Cheshmon, and Beit-Pelet,"
Yehoshua,15,28,"And Chatzar Shual, Be'er-Sheva, and Bizyot-Yah,"
Yehoshua,15,29,"Ba'alah, Iyim, Etzem,"
Yehoshua,15,30,"And Eltolad, and Kesil, and Chormah,"
Yehoshua,15,31,"And Tziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah,"
Yehoshua,15,32,"And Levaot, and Shilchim, and Ayin, and Rimmon; all the cities are 29, with their villages."
Yehoshua,15,33,"And in the Shefelah: Eshta'ol, and Tzorah, and Ashnah,"
Yehoshua,15,34,"And Zanoach, and Ein-Gannim, Tapuach, and Enam,"
Yehoshua,15,35,"Yarmut, and Adullam, Sokhoh, and Azekah,"
Yehoshua,15,36,"And Sha'arayim, and Aditayim, and Gederah, and Gederotayim; 14 cities with their villages."
Yehoshua,15,37,"Tzenan, and Chadashah, and Migdal-Gad,"
Yehoshua,15,38,"And Dile'an, and Mitzpeh, and Yokte'el,"
Yehoshua,15,39,"Lakhish, and Botzkat, and Eglon,"
Yehoshua,15,40,"And Kabbon, and Lachmas, and Kitlish,"
Yehoshua,15,41,"And Gederot, Beit-Dagon, and Naamah, and Makkedah; 16 cities with their villages."
Yehoshua,15,42,"Livnah, and Eter, and Ashan,"
Yehoshua,15,43,"And Yiftach, and Ashnah, and Netziv,"
Yehoshua,15,44,"And Ke'ilah, and Achziv, and Mareshah; 9 cities with their villages."
Yehoshua,15,45,"Ekron, with her towns and her villages."
Yehoshua,15,46,"From Ekron even unto the Yam, all that lay near Ashdod, with their villages."
Yehoshua,15,47,"Ashdod with her towns and her villages, Azah (Gaza) with her towns and her villages, unto the Wadi Mitzrayim, and the Yam HaGadol, and the coastline thereof."
Yehoshua,15,48,"And in the har, Shamir, and Yatir, and Sokho,"
Yehoshua,15,49,"And Dannah, and Kiryat Sannah, which is Devir,"
Yehoshua,15,50,"And Anav, and Eshtemoh, and Anim,"
Yehoshua,15,51,"And Goshen, and Cholon, and Giloh; 11 cities with their villages;"
Yehoshua,15,52,"Arav, and Dumah, and Esh'an,"
Yehoshua,15,53,"And Yanum, and Beit-Tappuach, and Aphekah,"
Yehoshua,15,54,"And Chumtah, and Kiryat-Arba, which is Chevron, and Tzior; 9 cities with their villages;"
Yehoshua,15,55,"Ma'on, Carmel, and Ziph, and Yutah,"
Yehoshua,15,56,"And Yizre'el, and Yokde'am, and Zanoach,"
Yehoshua,15,57,"Kayin, Giv'ah, and Timnah; 10 cities with their villages;"
Yehoshua,15,58,"Chalchul, Beit-Tzur, and Gedor,"
Yehoshua,15,59,"And Ma'arat, and Beit-Anot, and Eltekon; 6 cities with their villages;"
Yehoshua,15,60,"Kiryat Ba'al, which is Kiryat-Ye'arim, and Rabbah; 2 cities with their villages;"
Yehoshua,15,61,"In the midbar, Beit-Aravah, Middin, and Sekhakhah,"
Yehoshua,15,62,"And Nivshan, and the Ir HaMelach, and Ein-Gedi; 6 cities with their villages."
Yehoshua,15,63,"As for the Yevusi, the inhabitants of Yerushalayim, the Bnei Yehudah could not drive them out; but the Yevusi dwell with the Bnei Yehudah at Yerushalayim unto HaYom Hazeh."
Yehoshua,16,1,"And the goral (lot) of the Bnei Yosef ran from the Yarden by Yericho, east of the spring at Yericho, to the midbar that goeth up from Yericho into the hill country of Beit-El,"
Yehoshua,16,2,"And goeth out from Beit-El to Luz, and passeth along unto the territory of Arki to Atarot,"
Yehoshua,16,3,"And goeth down westward to the territory of Yaphleti, unto the territory of Lower Beit-Choron, and to Gezer; ending at the Yam."
Yehoshua,16,4,"So the Bnei Yosef, Menasheh and Ephrayim, inherited their nachalah."
Yehoshua,16,5,"And the boundary of the Bnei Ephrayim according to their mishpekhot was thus: the boundary of their nachalah on the east side was Atrot Addar, unto Upper Beit-Choron;"
Yehoshua,16,6,"And the boundary ran toward the Yam to Michmetat on the north side; and the boundary ran eastward unto Ta'anat Shiloh, and passed by it on the east to Yanoach;"
Yehoshua,16,7,"And it ran down from Yanoach to Atarot, and to Na'arah, and came to Yericho, and ran to an end at the Yarden."
Yehoshua,16,8,The boundary ran from Tapuach westward unto the Wadi Kanah; and the end thereof ran to the Yam. This is the nachalah of the tribe of the Bnei Ephrayim by their mishpekhot.
Yehoshua,16,9,"And the towns set aside for the Bnei Ephrayim were inside the Bnei Menasheh, all the towns with their villages."
Yehoshua,16,10,"And they drove not out the Kena'ani that dwelt in Gezer: but the Kena'ani dwell among the Ephrayim unto yom hazeh, and serve under forced labor."
Yehoshua,17,1,"There was also a goral (lot) for the tribe of Menasheh; for he was the bechor of Yosef; Machir was the bechor of Menasheh and the av of Gil'ad, and because he was an ish milchamah, therefore he got Gil'ad and Bashan."
Yehoshua,17,2,"There was also a goral (lot) for the rest of the Bnei Menasheh by their mishpekhot; for the Bnei Avi'ezer, for the Bnei Chelek, for the Bnei Asriel, for the Bnei Shechem, for the Bnei Chepher, and for the Bnei Shemida; these were the zekharim of the Menasheh ben Yosef by their mishpekhot."
Yehoshua,17,3,"But Tzelophechad ben Chepher ben Gil'ad ben Machir ben Menasheh had no banim, but banot; and these are the shmot of his banot, Machlah, and No'ah, Choglah, Milcah, and Tirtzah."
Yehoshua,17,4,"And they came near before El'azar HaKohen, and before Yehoshua ben Nun, and before the nasi'im saying, Hashem commanded Moshe to give us a nachalah among acheinu. Therefore according to the commandment of Hashem he gave them a nachalah among the achim of their av."
Yehoshua,17,5,"And there fell ten tracts of land to Menasheh, in addition to Eretz Gil'ad and Bashan, which were on the other side of the Yarden;"
Yehoshua,17,6,Because the banot of Menasheh had inherited a nachalah among his banim; and the rest of the Bnei Menasheh had Eretz Gil'ad.
Yehoshua,17,7,"And the boundary of Menasheh was from Asher to Michmetat, that lieth before Shechem; and the boundary ran along to the right to the inhabitants of Ein Tapuach."
Yehoshua,17,8,Now Menasheh had Eretz Tapuach; but Tapuach on the border of Menasheh belonged to the Bnei Ephrayim;
Yehoshua,17,9,"And the boundary descended unto the Wadi Kanah, southward of the Wadi; these towns of Ephrayim are among the towns of Menasheh; the boundary of Menasheh also was on the north side of the Wadi, and ended at the Yam;"
Yehoshua,17,10,"Southward it was Ephrayimʼs, and northward it was Menashehʼs, and the Yam is its boundary; and they met together in Asher on the north, and in Yissakhar on the east."
Yehoshua,17,11,"And Menasheh had in Yissakhar and in Asher Beit-She'an and its towns, and Yivle'am and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Ein-dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Ta'nakh and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns, sheloshet (three) of Nafet."
Yehoshua,17,12,Yet the Bnei Menasheh could not drive out the inhabitants of those towns; but the Kena'ani persisted dwelling in that land.
Yehoshua,17,13,"Yet it came to pass, when the Bnei Yisroel increased in chozek (strength) that they put the Kena'ani to forced labor, but did not utterly drive them out."
Yehoshua,17,14,"And the Bnei Yosef spoke unto Yehoshua, saying, Why hast thou given me for a nachalah but one goral and one chevel (portion, lot) to inherit, seeing I am an am rav, forasmuch as Hashem hath blessed me hitherto?"
Yehoshua,17,15,"And Yehoshua answered them, If thou be an am rav, then get thee up to the wood country, and cut down for thyself there in the Eretz HaPerizzi and HaRepha'im, if Har Ephrayim be too small for thee."
Yehoshua,17,16,"And the Bnei Yosef said, The har is not enough for us; and all the Kena'ani that dwell in the eretz haemek have chariots of barzel (iron) , both they who are of Beit-She'an and her towns, and they who are of the emek Yizre'el."
Yehoshua,17,17,"And Yehoshua spoke unto Bais Yosef, even to Ephrayim and to Menasheh, saying, Thou art an am rav, and hast ko'ach gadol; thou shalt not have goral echad only;"
Yehoshua,17,18,"But the har shall be thine; for it is a forest, and thou shalt cut it down; and the rest of the cleared land shall be thine; for thou shalt drive out the Kena'ani, though they have chariots of barzel (iron) , and though they be chazak."
Yehoshua,18,1,"And the kol Adat Bnei Yisroel assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the Ohel Mo'ed there. And HaAretz was subdued before them."
Yehoshua,18,2,"And there remained among the Bnei Yisroel shivah shevatim (seven tribes) , which had not yet received their nachalah."
Yehoshua,18,3,"And Yehoshua said unto the Bnei Yisroel, How long are ye mitrapim (slack ones, cowardly) going to take to go in and possess HaAretz, which Hashem Elohei Avoteichem hath given you?"
Yehoshua,18,4,"Appoint from among you shloshah anashim for each tribe; and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through and survey the land, and write down a description of it, according to the nachalah of each; and they shall come again to me."
Yehoshua,18,5,"And they shall divide it into shivah chalakim (seven portions) ; Yehudah shall abide in their territory on the south, and Bais Yosef shall abide in their territory on the north."
Yehoshua,18,6,"Ye shall therefore write a description of HaAretz in shivah chalakim, and bring the description here to me, that I may cast goral for you here before Hashem Eloheinu."
Yehoshua,18,7,"But the Levi'im have no chelek among you; for the Kehunah Hashem is their nachalah; and Gad, and Reuven, and the half tribe of Menasheh, have received their nachalah beyond the Yarden on the east, which Moshe Eved Hashem gave them."
Yehoshua,18,8,"And the men arose, and went away; and Yehoshua charged them that went to map HaAretz, saying, Go and survey the land, and write a description of it, and come again to me, that I may here cast goral for you before Hashem in Shiloh."
Yehoshua,18,9,"And the men went and passed through HaAretz, and described it by towns in shivah chalakim in a sefer, and came again to Yehoshua to the machaneh at Shiloh."
Yehoshua,18,10,And Yehoshua cast goral for them in Shiloh before Hashem ; and there Yehoshua divided HaAretz unto the Bnei Yisroel according to their portions.
Yehoshua,18,11,And the goral of the tribe of the Bnei Binyamin came up according to their mishpekhot; and the territory of their goral (allotment) came forth between the Bnei Yehudah and the Bnei Yosef.
Yehoshua,18,12,"And their boundary on the north side was from the Yarden; and the boundary went up along the side of Yericho on the north, and went up through the har westward; and ended at the midbar of Beit-Aven."
Yehoshua,18,13,"And the boundary went over from there toward Luz, to the side of Luz (that is, Beit-El) southward; and the boundary descended to Atrot Addar, near the har that lieth on the south side of the Lower Beit-Choron."

Yehoshua,20,1," Hashem also spoke unto Yehoshua, saying,"
Yehoshua,20,2,"Speak to the Bnei Yisroel, saying, Designate for you cities of refuge, whereof I spoke unto you by the yad Moshe:"
Yehoshua,20,3,That the slayer that killeth any nefesh unawares and unwittingly may flee there; and they shall be your refuge from the Go'el HaDahm.
Yehoshua,20,4,"And when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall stand at the petach (entrance) of the sha'ar ha'ir, and shall declare his cause in the ears of the zekenim of that city, they shall admit him into the Ir unto them, and give him a makom, that he may dwell among them."
Yehoshua,20,5,"And if the Go'el HaDahm pursue after him, then they shall not surrender the slayer up into his yad; because he struck his neighbor unwittingly, and not with malice against him beforetime."
Yehoshua,20,6,"And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before HaEdah L'Mishpat, and until the Mot of the HaKohen HaGadol that shall be in those yamim; then shall the slayer return, and come unto his own city, and unto his own bais, unto the Ir from whence he fled."

Yehoshua,21,1,"Then came near the Rashei Avot Levi'im unto El'azar HaKohen, and unto Yehoshua ben Nun, and unto the Rashei Avot of the tribes of the Bnei Yisroel;"
Yehoshua,21,2,"And they spoke unto them at Shiloh in Eretz Kena'an, saying, Hashem commanded by the yad Moshe to give us towns to dwell in, with the migrashim thereof for our livestock."
Yehoshua,21,3,"And the Bnei Yisroel gave unto the Levi'im out of their nachalah, at the commandment of Hashem , these towns and their migrashim."
Yehoshua,21,4,"And the goral (lot) came out for the mishpekhot of the Kehati. And the Bnei Aharon HaKohen, which were of the Levi'im, had by lot 13 towns out of the tribe of Yehudah, and out of the tribe of Shim'on, and out of the tribe of Binyamin."

Yehoshua,21,8,"And the Bnei Yisroel gave by goral unto the Levi'im these towns with their migrashim, just as Hashem commanded by the yad Moshe."
Yehoshua,21,9,"And they allotted out of the tribe of the Bnei Yehudah, and out of the tribe of the Bnei Shim'on, these towns which are here called b'shem (by name),"
Yehoshua,21,10,"Which the Bnei Aharon, being of the mishpekhot of the Kehati, who were of the Bnei Levi, had; for theirs was the goral rishonah."
Yehoshua,21,11,"And they gave them Kiryat-Arba (Arba, Avi HaAnak) , which is Chevron, in the har Yehudah, with the migrash (pastureland) thereof around it."
Yehoshua,21,12,"But the sadeh haIr, and the villages thereof, they gave to Kalev ben Yephunneh for his achuzzah (possession, property, estate)."
Yehoshua,21,13,"Thus they gave to the Bnei Aharon HaKohen Chevron with its migrash, to be an Ir Miklat HaRotzeiach (City of Refuge of the Slayer) ; and Livnah with its migrash,"

Yehoshua,21,21,"For they gave them Shechem with its migrash in har Ephrayim, to be an Ir Miklat HaRotzeiach; and Gezer with its migrash,"
Yehoshua,21,22,"And Kivtzayim with its migrash, and Beit-Choron with its migrash; 4 towns."

Yehoshua,21,28,"And out of the tribe of Yissakhar, Kishyon with its migrash, Dovrat with its migrash,"
Yehoshua,21,29,"Yarmut with its migrash, Ein-Gannim with its migrash; 4 towns."
Yehoshua,21,30,"And out of the tribe of Asher, Mish'al with its migrash, Avdon with its migrash,"

Yehoshua,21,32,"And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in the Galil with its migrash, to be an Ir Miklat HaRotzeiach; and Chammot Dor with its migrash, and Kartan with its migrash; 3 towns."
Yehoshua,21,33,All the towns of the Gershuni according to their mishpekhot were 13 towns with their migrash.
Yehoshua,21,34,"And unto the mishpekhot Bnei Merari, the rest of the Levi'im, out of the tribe of Zevulun, Yokne'am with its migrash, and Kartah with its migrash,"
Yehoshua,21,35,"Dimnah with its migrash, Nahalal with its migrash; 4 towns."
Yehoshua,21,36,"And out of the tribe of Reuven, Betzer with its migrash, and Yahtzah with its migrash,"
Yehoshua,21,37,"Kedemot with its migrash, and Mepha'at with its migrash; 4 towns."
Yehoshua,21,38,"And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramot in Gil'ad with its migrash, to be an Ir Miklat HaRotzeiach; and Machanayim with its migrash,"
Yehoshua,21,39,"Cheshbon with its migrash, Yazer with its migrash; 4 towns in all."
Yehoshua,21,40,"So all the towns for the Bnei Merari by their mishpekhot, which were remaining of the mishpekhot Levi'im, were by their goral 12 towns."
Yehoshua,21,41,"All the towns of the Levi'im within the achuzzat Bnei Yisroel (possession, estate of the Sons of Israel) were 48 towns with their migrashim."
Yehoshua,21,42,These towns were every one with their migrash around them; thus were all these towns.
Yehoshua,21,43,"And Hashem gave unto Yisroel Kol HaAretz which He swore to give unto their Avot; and they possessed it, and dwelt therein."
Yehoshua,21,44,"And Hashem gave them manoach (rest, peace) on every side, according to all that He swore unto their Avot; and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them; Hashem delivered all their enemies into their yad."
Yehoshua,21,45,"There naphal (failed, fell) not davar mikol hadavar hatov (any promise from all the good promises) which Hashem had spoken unto Bais Yisroel; hakol bo (all came, all came to pass)."
Yehoshua,22,1,"Then Yehoshua summoned the Reuveni, and the Gadi, and the half-tribe of Menasheh,"
Yehoshua,22,2,"And said unto them, Ye have been shomer over all that Moshe Eved Hashem commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you;"
Yehoshua,22,3,"Ye have not deserted your achim these yamim rabbim to yom hazeh, but have been shomer over the mishmeret mitzvat Hashem Eloheichem (charge, duty of the commandment of Hashem your G-d.)"
Yehoshua,22,4,"And now Hashem Eloheichem hath given manoach unto your achim, just as He promised them; therefore now return ye, and get you unto your ohalim, and unto the Eretz Achuz-zatechem, which Moshe eved Hashem gave you on the other side of the Yarden."
Yehoshua,22,5,"But be shomer to do the mitzvah and the torah, which Moshe Eved Hashem charged you, to love Hashem Eloheichem, and to walk in all the darkhei Hashem, and to be shomer mitzvot regarding His commandments, and to have deveykus (attachment, cleavimg to G-d) to Him, and to serve Him in avodas [kodesh] with kol levavchem uvkhol nafshechem (all your heart, with all your nefesh)."
Yehoshua,22,6,"So Yehoshua gave them a brocha, and sent them away; and they went unto their ohalim."
Yehoshua,22,7,"Now to the one half of the tribe of Menasheh Moshe had given possession in Bashan; but unto the other half thereof gave Yehoshua among their achim on this side Yarden westward. And when Yehoshua sent them away also unto their ohalim, then he gave them a brocha."
Yehoshua,22,8,"And he spoke unto them, saying, Return with nekasim rabbin (many possessions) unto your ohalim, and with mikneh rav me'od (very much cattle) , with kesef, and with zahav, and with nechoshet, and with barzel (iron) , and with very much selamot (clothes) ; divide the plunder of your enemies with your achim."
Yehoshua,22,9,"And the Bnei Reuven and the Bnei Gad and the half-tribe of Menasheh returned, and departed from the Bnei Yisroel at Shiloh, which is in Eretz Kena'an, to go unto Eretz Gil'ad, to the Eretz Achuzzatam (the land of their possession, estate) , whereof they had taken as a possession, according to the word of Hashem by the yad Moshe."
Yehoshua,22,10,"And when they came unto the Gelilot of the Yarden, that is in eretz Kena'an, the Bnei Reuven and the Bnei Gad and the half-tribe of Menasheh built there a mizbe'ach by the Yarden, a mizbe'ach gadol in appearance."
Yehoshua,22,11,"And the Bnei Yisroel heard, Hinei, the Bnei Reuven and the Bnei Gad and the half-tribe of Menasheh have built a mizbe'ach at the edge of Eretz Kena'an, in the region of the Yarden, on the side belonging to the Bnei Yisroel."
Yehoshua,22,12,"And when the Bnei Yisroel heard of it, the kol Adat Bnei Yisroel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up to war against them."
Yehoshua,22,13,"And the Bnei Yisroel sent unto the Bnei Reuven, and to the Bnei Gad, and to the half-tribe of Menasheh, into Eretz Gil'ad, Pinchas ben El'azar the Kohen,"
Yehoshua,22,14,"And with him ten nasi'im, one each of the bais av for all the tribes of Yisroel; and each one was a Rosh Bais Avotam among the Alephei Yisroel."
Yehoshua,22,15,"And they came unto the Bnei Reuven, and to the Bnei Gad, and to the half-tribe of Menasheh, unto Eretz Gil'ad, and they spoke with them, saying,"
Yehoshua,22,16,"Thus saith the Kol Adat Hashem , What ma'al (trespass, disobedience, breach of faith, treachery, breaking faith) is this that ye have committed against the Elohei Yisroel, to turn away this day from following Hashem , in that ye have built you a mizbe'ach, that ye might rebel this day against Hashem?"
Yehoshua,22,17,"Is the avon Pe'or too little for us, from which we are not tahor until this day, even though there was the negef (plague) in the Adat Hashem,"
Yehoshua,22,18,"But that ye must turn away this day from following Hashem ? And it will be, seeing ye rebel hayom (today) against Hashem , that machar (tomorrow) He will be angry with the kol Adat Yisroel."
Yehoshua,22,19,"Notwithstanding, if the eretz achuzzatechem be tamei (unclean) , then pass ye over unto the eretz achuzzat Hashem , wherein Hashem ʼs Mishkan dwelleth, and take possession among us; but rebel not against Hashem , nor rebel against us, in building you a mizbe'ach other than the mizbe'ach Hashem Eloheinu."
Yehoshua,22,20,"Did not Achan ben Zerach break faith in the cherem, and ketzef (wrath) fell on kol Adat Yisroel? And that ish perished not alone in his avon (iniquity)."
Yehoshua,22,21,"Then the Bnei Reuven and the Bnei Gad and the half-tribe of Menasheh answered, and said unto the Rashei Alephei Yisroel,"
Yehoshua,22,22,"El Elohim, Hashem El Elohim, He knoweth, and Yisroel shall have da'as; if it be in mered (rebellion) , or if in ma'al against Hashem , al toshieini hayom hazeh (save us not this day),"
Yehoshua,22,23,"That we have built us a mizbe'ach to turn away from following Hashem , or if to offer thereon olah or minchah, or if to offer zivkhei shelamim thereon, let Hashem Himself call it to account;"
Yehoshua,22,24,"No, rather have we not done it for fear, for this reason, saying, In time to come your banim might speak unto our banim, saying, What have ye to do with Hashem Elohei Yisroel?"
Yehoshua,22,25,"For Hashem hath made the Yarden a boundary between us and you, ye Bnei Reuven and Bnei Gad; ye have no chelek in Hashem ; so might your banim make our banim cease from fearing Hashem."
Yehoshua,22,26,"Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us the mizbe'ach, not for olah nor for zevach,"
Yehoshua,22,27,"But that it may be an ed (witness) between us, and you, and doroteinu (our generations) after us, that we might do the avodas Hashem before Him with oloteinu, and with zevakheinu, and with shelameinu; that your banim may not say to our banim in time to come, Ye have no chelek in Hashem."
Yehoshua,22,28,"Therefore we said, that it shall be, when they should so say to us or to doroteinu in time to come, that we may say again, See the tavnit (pattern, replica) of the mizbe'ach Hashem , which Avoteinu built, not for olah, nor for zevach; but it is an ed (witness) between us and you."
Yehoshua,22,29,"Chalilah lanu (far be it from us) that we should rebel against Hashem , and turn today from following Hashem , to build a mizbe'ach for olah, for minchah, or for zevach, other than the Mizbe'ach Hashem Eloheinu that is before His Mishkan."
Yehoshua,22,30,"And when Pinchas HaKohen, and the nasi'im of the Edah and Rashei Alephei Yisroel which were with him, heard the words that the Bnei Reuven and the Bnei Gad and the Bnei Menasheh spoke, it pleased them."
Yehoshua,22,31,"And Pinchas ben El'azar HaKohen said unto the Bnei Reuven, and to the Bnei Gad, and to the Bnei Menasheh, Today we have da'as that Hashem is among us, because ye have not broken faith with Hashem ; now ye have saved the Bnei Yisroel out of the yad Hashem."
Yehoshua,22,32,"And Pinchas ben El'azar HaKohen, and the nasi'im, returned from the Bnei Reuven, and from the Bnei Gad, out of Eretz Gil'ad, unto Eretz Kena'an, to the Bnei Yisroel, and reported the matter unto them."
Yehoshua,22,33,"And the thing pleased the Bnei Yisroel; and the Bnei Yisroel made brocha unto Elohim, and spoke no more about going up against them in battle, to destroy HaAretz wherein the Bnei Reuven and Gad dwelt."
Yehoshua,22,34,"And the Bnei Reuven and the Bnei Gad called the mizbe'ach Ed (Witness) , for it is between us that Hashem is HaElohim."
Yehoshua,23,1,"And it came to pass yamim rabbim after Hashem had given manoach unto Yisroel from all their surrounding enemies, that Yehoshua was zaken and advanced in days."
Yehoshua,23,2,"And Yehoshua called for Kol Yisroel, and for their zekenim, and for their Rashim, and for their Shofetim, and for their Shoterim, and said unto them, I am zaken and advanced in days;"
Yehoshua,23,3,And ye have seen all that Hashem Eloheichem hath done unto all these Goyim for your sakes; for Hashem Eloheichem is He that hath fought for you.
Yehoshua,23,4,"Remember I have allotted unto you these Goyim that remain, to be a nachalah for your shvatim, from the Yarden, even kol HaGoyim that I have cut off, even unto the Yam HaGadol toward the setting of the shemesh."
Yehoshua,23,5,"And Hashem Eloheichem, He shall expel them from before you, and drive them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess their land, just as Hashem Eloheichem hath promised unto you."
Yehoshua,23,6,"Therefore chazak! Be very courageous to be shomer and to do all that is written in the Sefer Torah Moshe, that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right or to the left;"
Yehoshua,23,7,"That ye come not among these Goyim, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the shem of eloheihem, nor have to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow down unto them;"
Yehoshua,23,8,"But have deveykus unto Hashem Eloheichem, just as ye have done unto this day."
Yehoshua,23,9,"For Hashem hath driven out from before you Goyim Gedolim and atzumim (powerful ones) ; but as for you, no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day."
Yehoshua,23,10,"Ish echad of you shall chase eleph; for Hashem Eloheichem, He it is that fighteth for you, just as He hath promised you."
Yehoshua,23,11,"Be shomer me'od therefore unto yourselves, that ye love Hashem Eloheichem."
Yehoshua,23,12,"Else if ye do in anywise turn back, and have deveykus unto the remnant of these Goyim, even these that remain among you, and shall inter-marry with them, associate with them, and they with you;"
Yehoshua,23,13,"Have da'as for a certainty that Hashem Eloheichem will no more drive out any of these Goyim from before you; but they shall be pach (snares) and mokesh (traps) unto you, and shot (scourges) on your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this adamah hatovah which Hashem Eloheichem hath given you."
Yehoshua,23,14,"And, hinei, now I am going the derech kol ha'aretz; and ye know in all your hearts and in all your nefashot, that not one thing hath failed of all the devarim hatovim which Hashem Eloheichem promised concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, and not one thing hath failed thereof."
Yehoshua,23,15,"Therefore it shall come to pass, that just as kol hadavar hatov are come upon you, which Hashem Eloheichem promised you; so shall Hashem bring upon you kol hadavar harah, until He hath destroyed you from off this adamah hatovah which Hashem Eloheichem hath given you."
Yehoshua,23,16,"When ye have transgressed the Brit Hashem Eloheichem, which He commanded you, and have gone and served elohim acharim, and bowed down yourselves to them; then shall the Af Hashem be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off HaAretz Hatovah which He hath given unto you."
Yehoshua,24,1,"And Yehoshua gathered Kol Shivtei Yisroel to Shechem, and called for the Ziknei Yisroel, and for their Rashim, and for their shofetim, and for their shoterim; and they presented themselves before HaElohim."
Yehoshua,24,2,"And Yehoshua said unto Kol HaAm, Thus saith Hashem Elohei Yisroel, Avoteichem dwelt on the other side of the River long ago, even Terach, Avi Avraham, and Avi Nachor: and they served elohim acherim."
Yehoshua,24,3,"But I took Avichem Avraham from the other side of the River, and led him through Kol Eretz Kena'an, and multiplied his zera, and gave him Yitzchak."
Yehoshua,24,4,"And I gave unto Yitzchak Ya'akov and Esav; and I gave unto Esav Mt Se'ir, to possess it; but Ya'akov and his banim went down into Mitzrayim."
Yehoshua,24,5,"I sent Moshe also and Aharon, and I plagued Mitzrayim, according to that which I did among them; and afterward I brought you out."
Yehoshua,24,6,And I brought Avoteichem out of Mitzrayim; and ye came unto the Yam [Suf]; the Mitzrayim pursued after Avoteichem with chariots and parashim unto the Yam Suf.
Yehoshua,24,7,"And when they cried unto Hashem , He put darkness between you and the Mitzrayim, and brought the yam upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Mitzrayim; and ye dwelt in the midbar yamim rabbim."
Yehoshua,24,8,"And I brought you into the Eretz HaEmori, the ones dwelling on the other side of the Yarden; they fought against you; I gave them into your yad, that ye might possess their land; I destroyed them from before you."
Yehoshua,24,9,"Then Balak ben Tzippor Melech Moav arose and warred against Yisroel, and sent and summoned Balaam ben Be'or to curse you;"
Yehoshua,24,10,But I would not pay heed unto Balaam; therefore he made a brocha over you; so I saved you out of his yad.
Yehoshua,24,11,"And you went over the Yarden, and came unto Yericho; and the Ba'alei Yericho fought against you, and HaEmori, and the Perizzi, and the Kena'ani, and the Chitti, and the Girgashi, the Chivi, and the Yevusi; and I gave them into your yad."
Yehoshua,24,12,"And I sent the tzirah (hornet) before you, which drove them out ahead of you, even the two melachim of the Emori; but not with thy cherev, nor with thy keshet."
Yehoshua,24,13,"So I have given you an Eretz for which ye did not toil, and towns which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; kramim and zetim (olive groves) which ye eat but did not plant."
Yehoshua,24,14,"Now therefore fear Hashem , serve Him batamim (completely) and in emes; put away the elohim which Avoteichem served on the other side of the River, and in Mitzrayim; and serve ye Hashem."
Yehoshua,24,15,"And if it seem rah unto you to serve Hashem , choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the elohim which Avoteichem served that were on the other side of the River, or the elohei HaEmori, in whose land ye dwell; but as for me and my bais, we will serve Hashem."
Yehoshua,24,16,"And the people answered and said, Chalilah lanu (far be it from us) that we should forsake Hashem , to serve elohim acharim;"
Yehoshua,24,17,"For Hashem Eloheinu, He it is that brought us up and Avoteinu out of Eretz Mitzrayim, from the bais avadim, and which did those haotot hagedolot in our sight, and was shomer over us in kol HaDerech in which we went, and among Kol HaAmim through whom we passed;"
Yehoshua,24,18,"And Hashem drove out from before us Kol HaAmim, even HaEmori which dwelt in HaAretz; therefore will we also serve Hashem ; for He is Eloheinu."
Yehoshua,24,19,"And Yehoshua said unto HaAm, Ye are not able to serve Hashem ; for He is an Elohim Kedoshim; He is an El Kanno (jealous G-d) ; He will not forgive your paysha'im nor your chattot."
Yehoshua,24,20,"If ye forsake Hashem , and serve elohei nekhar (foreign g-ds) , then He will turn and bring you rah, and consume you, after that He hath done you tov."
Yehoshua,24,21,"And HaAm said unto Yehoshua, No; but we will serve Hashem."
Yehoshua,24,22,"And Yehoshua said unto HaAm, Ye are edim against yourselves that ye have chosen for you Hashem , to serve Him. And they said, We are edim."
Yehoshua,24,23,"Now therefore put away, said he, the elohei hanechar which are among you, and yield your levav unto Hashem Elohei Yisroel."
Yehoshua,24,24,"And HaAm said unto Yehoshua, Hashem Eloheinu will we serve, and His voice will we obey."
Yehoshua,24,25,"So Yehoshua made a Brit with HaAm that day, and set them a chok and a mishpat at Shechem."
Yehoshua,24,26,"And Yehoshua wrote these words in the Sefer Torah Elohim, and took an Even Gedolah, and set it up there under an oak, that was near the Mikdash Hashem."
Yehoshua,24,27,"And Yehoshua said unto kol HaAm, Hinei, this Even (Stone) shall be as an edah (witness) unto us; for it hath heard all the words of Hashem which He spoke unto us; it shall be therefore as an edah (witness) unto you, lest ye are untrue to Eloheichem."
Yehoshua,24,28,"So Yehoshua sent HaAm away, every man unto his nachalah."
Yehoshua,24,29,"And it came to pass after these things, that Yehoshua ben Nun Eved Hashem , died, being an hundred and ten years old."
Yehoshua,24,30,"And they buried him in the territory of his nachalah in Timnat-Serach, which is in har Ephrayim, north of Mt Ga'ash."
Yehoshua,24,31,"And Yisroel served Hashem all the days of Yehoshua, and all the days of the Zekenim that outlived Yehoshua, and which had da'as of kol ma'asei Hashem , that He had done for Yisroel."
Yehoshua,24,32,"And the atzmot Yosef, which the Bnei Yisroel brought up out of Mitzrayim, they buried at Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Ya'akov bought of the Bnei Chamor Av Shechem for a hundred pieces of silver: and it became the nachalah of the Bnei Yosef."
Yehoshua,24,33,"And El'azar ben Aharon died; and they buried him on a hill that belonged to Pinchas his son, which was given him in har Ephrayim."
