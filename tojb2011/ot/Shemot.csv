Shemot,1,1,"Now these are the Shemot Bnei Yisroel, which came into Mitzrayim; every ish and his bais came with Ya'akov:"
Shemot,1,2,"Reuven, Shim'on, Levi, and Yehudah,"
Shemot,1,3,"Yissakhar, Zevulun, and Binyamin,"
Shemot,1,4,"Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher."
Shemot,1,5,And all the nefesh that came out of the loins of Ya'akov were seventy nefesh; for Yosef was in Mitzrayim already.
Shemot,1,6,"And Yosef died, and all his achim, and all that generation."
Shemot,1,7,"And the Bnei Yisroel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and became exceeding strong; and the land was filled with them."
Shemot,1,8,"Now there arose a melech chadash over Mitzrayim, which had no da'as of Yosef."
Shemot,1,9,"And he said unto his people, Hinei, the Am Bnei Yisroel are more and stronger than we."
Shemot,1,10,"Come, let us outsmart them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any milchamah, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land."
Shemot,1,11,"Therefore they did set over them sarei missim (taskmasters) to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh supply cities, Pitom and Ra'meses."
Shemot,1,12,"But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and spread out. And they were in dread because of the Bnei Yisroel."
Shemot,1,13,And the Egyptians made the Bnei Yisroel to serve with rigor;
Shemot,1,14,"And they made their lives bitter with avodah kashah (hard bondage) , in mortar, and in brick, and in all manner of avodah in the sadeh; all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigor."
Shemot,1,15,"And Melech Mitzrayim spoke to the meyalledot HaIvriyyot (Hebrew midwives) , of which the shem of the one was Shiphrah, and of the other Puah;"
Shemot,1,16,"And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to HaIvriyyot (the Hebrew women) and see them upon the delivery stool; if it be a ben, then ye shall kill him; but if it be a bat, then she shall live."
Shemot,1,17,"But the meyalledot feared HaElohim, and did not as Melech Mitzrayim commanded them, but saved the yeladim alive."
Shemot,1,18,"So Melech Mitzrayim called for the meyalledot, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the yeladim alive?"
Shemot,1,19,"And the meyalledot said unto Pharaoh, Because HaIvriyyot are not as the Egyptian women; for they are vigorous, and are delivered before the meyalledot come in unto them."
Shemot,1,20,"Therefore Elohim dealt well with the meyalledot; and the people multiplied, and grew very strong."
Shemot,1,21,"And it came to pass, because the meyalledot feared HaElohim, that He established them batim."
Shemot,1,22,"And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every ben that is born ye shall cast into the Nile, and every bat ye shall save alive."
Shemot,2,1,"And there went an ish of the Bais Levi, and took to wife a bat Levi."
Shemot,2,2,"And the isha conceived, and bore a ben; and when she saw him that he was tov, she hid him three months."
Shemot,2,3,"And when she could no longer hide him, she took for him a tevah (ark) of papyrus, and daubed it with tar and with pitch, and put the yeled therein; and she set it in the reeds by the bank of the Nile."
Shemot,2,4,"And his achot stood afar off, to see what would be done to him."
Shemot,2,5,"And the Bat Pharaoh came down to bathe herself at the Nile; and her na'arot walked along by the Nileʼs bank; and when she saw the tevah (ark) among the reeds, she sent her amah (maid servant) to fetch it."
Shemot,2,6,"And when she had opened it, she saw the yeled; and, hinei, the na'ar was crying. And she had compassion on him, and said, This one is of the yaldei HaIvrim (Hebrew children)."
Shemot,2,7,"Then said his achot to Bat Pharaoh, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of HaIvriyyot, that she may nurse the yeled for thee?"
Shemot,2,8,"And Bat Pharaoh said to her, Go. And haalmah went and called the em hayeled."
Shemot,2,9,"And Bat Pharaoh said unto her, Take this yeled away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the isha took the yeled, and nursed it."
Shemot,2,10,"And the yeled grew, and she brought him unto Bat Pharaoh, and he became her ben. And she called shmo Moshe: and she said, Because meshitihu (I drew him) out of the mayim."
Shemot,2,11,"And it came to pass in those days, when Moshe was grown, that he went out unto his achim, and looked on their sevalot: and he spied an Egyptian striking an ish Ivri, one of his achim."
Shemot,2,12,"And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no ish, he killed the Egyptian, and hid him in the chol (sand)."
Shemot,2,13,"And when he went out the second day, hinei, two anashim Ivrim were fighting; he said to him in the wrong, Why strike thou thy re'a?"
Shemot,2,14,"And he said, Who made thee a sar and a shofet over us? Intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moshe feared, and thought, Surely this thing is known."
Shemot,2,15,"Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moshe. But Moshe fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in Eretz Midyan; and he sat down by a well."
Shemot,2,16,"Now the kohen of Midyan had sheva banot; and they came and drew mayim, and filled the troughs to water the tzon of their av."
Shemot,2,17,"And the ro'im (shepherds) came and drove them away; but Moshe stood up and rescued them, and watered their tzon."
Shemot,2,18,"And when they came to Reuel their av, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon today?"
Shemot,2,19,"And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the yad of the ro'im (shepherds) , and also drew enough for us, and watered the tzon."
Shemot,2,20,"And he said unto his banot, And where is he? Why is it that ye have left the ish? Call him, that he may eat lechem."
Shemot,2,21,And Moshe was content to dwell with the ish; and he gave Moshe Tzipporah his bat.
Shemot,2,22,"And she bore him a ben, and he called shmo Gershom; for he said, I have been a ger in a foreign land."
Shemot,2,23,"And it came to pass in process of time, that Melech Mitzrayim died; and the Bnei Yisroel groaned by reason of haAvodah (the Bondage) , and they cried out, and their cry came up unto HaElohim by reason of haAvodah."
Shemot,2,24,"And Elohim heard their groaning, and Elohim remembered His brit (covenant) with Avraham, with Yitzchak, and with Ya'akov."
Shemot,2,25,"And Elohim looked upon the Bnei Yisroel, and Elohim had da'as of them."
Shemot,3,1,"Now Moshe was ro'eh (shepherding) the tzon of Yitro his khoten (father-in-law) , the kohen Midyan; and he led the tzon to the backside of the midbar, and came to the Har HaElohim, even to Chorev."
Shemot,3,2,"And the Malach Hashem appeared unto him in a flame of eish out of the midst of a bush; and he looked, and, hinei, the bush burned with eish, and the bush was not consumed."
Shemot,3,3,"And Moshe thought, I will now turn aside, and see this mareh hagadol, why the bush is not burned up."
Shemot,3,4,"And when Hashem saw that he turned aside to see, Elohim called out unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moshe, Moshe. And he said, Hineni."
Shemot,3,5,"And He said, Draw not nearer here; put off thy na'alayim (sandals) from off thy raglayim, for hamakom whereon thou standest is admat kodesh."
Shemot,3,6,"Moreover He said, I am Elohei Avicha, Elohei Avraham, Elohei Yitzchak, and Elohei Ya'akov. And Moshe hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon HaElohim."
Shemot,3,7,"And Hashem said, I have surely seen the oni ami (affliction of My people) which are in Mitzrayim, and have heard their cry by reason of their nogesim (taskmasters) ; for I know their makhovim (sufferings);"
Shemot,3,8,"And I am come down to deliver them out of the yad Mitzrayim, and to bring them up out of that land unto an eretz tovah, a spacious eretz zavat cholov udevash; unto the place of the Kena'ani, and the Chitti, and the Emori, and the Perizzi, and the Chivi, and the Yevusi."
Shemot,3,9,"Now therefore, hinei, the cry of the Bnei Yisroel is come unto Me; and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them."
Shemot,3,10,"Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth My people the Bnei Yisroel out of Mitzrayim."
Shemot,3,11,"And Moshe said unto HaElohim, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the Bnei Yisroel out of Mitzrayim?"
Shemot,3,12,"And He said, Certainly Eh-heh-yeh (I will be) with thee; and this shall be haOt (the Sign) unto thee, that I have sent thee: when thou hast brought forth HaAm out of Mitzrayim, ye shall serve HaElohim upon this Har."
Shemot,3,13,"And Moshe said unto HaElohim, Hinei, when I come unto the Bnei Yisroel, and shall say unto them, Elohei Avoteichem hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is Shmo? what shall I say unto them?"
Shemot,3,14,"And Elohim said unto Moshe, Eh-heh-yeh ashair Eh-heh-yeh (I AM WHO I AM) ; and He said, Thus shalt thou say unto the Bnei Yisroel, EH-HEH-YEH (I AM) hath sent me unto you."
Shemot,3,15,"And Elohim said moreover unto Moshe, Thus shalt thou say unto Bnei Yisroel: Hashem , Elohei Avoteichem, Elohei Avraham, Elohei Yitzchak, and Elohei Ya'akov, hath sent me unto you: this is Shemi l'olam, and this is My remembrance unto all generations."
Shemot,3,16,"Go, and gather the Ziknei Yisroel together, and say unto them, Hashem Elohei Avoteichem, Elohei Avraham, Yitzchak, and Ya'akov, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Mitzrayim;"
Shemot,3,17,"And I have said, I will bring you up out of the Oni Mitzrayim unto the eretz Kena'ani, and the Chitti, and the Emori, and the Perizzi, and the Chivi, and the Yevusi unto eretz zavat cholov udevash."
Shemot,3,18,"And they shall pay heed to thy voice; and thou shalt go, thou and the Ziknei Yisroel, unto Melech Mitzrayim, and ye shall say unto him, Hashem Elohei HaIvriyim hath met with us; and let us go, now, derech shloshet yamim into the midbar, that we may sacrifice to Hashem Eloheinu."
Shemot,3,19,"And I have da'as that Melech Mitzrayim will not let you go, no, except by a yad chazakah."
Shemot,3,20,"And I will stretch out My yad, and strike Mitzrayim with all My nifle'ot which I will do in the midst thereof; and after that he will let you go."
Shemot,3,21,"And I will give this people chen in the sight of the Egyptians; and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty-handed."
Shemot,3,22,"But every isha shall borrow of her neighbor, and of her that sojourneth in her bais, jewels of kesef, and jewels of zahav, and clothing; and ye shall put them upon your banim, and upon your banot; so ye shall plunder the Egyptians."
Shemot,4,1,"And Moshe answered and said, But, what if they will not believe me, nor pay heed unto my voice but will say, Hashem hath not appeared unto thee."
Shemot,4,2,"And Hashem said unto him, What is that in thine yad? And he said, A matteh (a rod, staff)."
Shemot,4,3,"And He said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a nachash; and Moshe fled from before it."
Shemot,4,4,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, Put forth thine yad, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his yad, and caught it, and it became a matteh in his yad;"
Shemot,4,5,"That they may believe that Hashem Elohei Avotam, Elohei Avraham, Elohei Yitzchak, and Elohei Ya'akov, hath appeared unto thee."
Shemot,4,6,"And Hashem said furthermore unto him, Put now thine yad into thy kheyk. And he put his yad into his kheyk; and when he took it out, hinei, his yad was leprous as snow."
Shemot,4,7,"And He said, Put thine yad into thy kheyk again. And he put his yad into his kheyk again; and plucked it out of his kheyk, and, hinei, it was turned again as his other basar."
Shemot,4,8,"And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither pay heed to the voice of haOt Harishon, that they will believe the voice of haOt haAcharon."
Shemot,4,9,"And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two otot, neither pay heed unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the mayim of the Nile, and pour it upon the yabashah (dry land) ; and the mayim which thou takest out of the Nile shall become dahm upon the yabashah."
Shemot,4,10,"And Moshe said unto Hashem , O Adonoi, I am not an ish devarim, neither heretofore, nor since Thou hast spoken unto Thy eved; but I am slow of speech, and of a slow lashon."
Shemot,4,11,"And Hashem said unto him, Who hath made manʼs peh (mouth) ? Or who maketh dumb, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I, Hashem?"
Shemot,4,12,"Now therefore go, and Eh-heh-yeh (I will be) with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say."
Shemot,4,13,"And he said, O Adonoi, send, now, by the yad of him whom Thou wilt send."
Shemot,4,14,"And the Af Hashem was kindled against Moshe, and He said, Is there not Aharon thy ach the Levi? I know that he can speak well. And also, hinei, he cometh forth to meet thee; and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his lev."
Shemot,4,15,"And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth; and Eh-heh-yeh (I will be) with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do."
Shemot,4,16,"And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people; and he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of Elohim."
Shemot,4,17,"And thou shalt take this matteh in thine yad, wherewith thou shalt do haOtot."
Shemot,4,18,"And Moshe went and returned to Yitro his khoten (father-in-law) , and said unto him, Let me go, now, and return unto my achim which are in Mitzrayim, and see whether they be yet alive. And Yitro said to Moshe, Lech l'shalom (go in peace)."
Shemot,4,19,"And Hashem said unto Moshe in Midyan, Go, shuv (return) into Mitzrayim; for all the anashim are dead which sought thy life."
Shemot,4,20,"And Moshe took his isha and his banim, and set them upon a donkey, and he returned to Eretz Mitzrayim; and matteh HaElohim in his yad."
Shemot,4,21,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, When thou goest to return into Mitzrayim, see that thou do all those mofetim before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine yad: but I will harden his lev, that he shall not let HaAm go."
Shemot,4,22,"And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith Hashem , Yisroel is beni (My son) , even My bechor (first-born):"
Shemot,4,23,"And I say unto thee, Let beni (My son) go, that he may serve Me: and if thou refuse to let him go, hinei, I will slay thy ben, even thy bechor."
Shemot,4,24,"And it came to pass on the derech at the malon, that Hashem met him, and sought to kill him."
Shemot,4,25,"Then Tzipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the orlat ben (foreskin of son) of her, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a choson damim (a bridegroom of blood) art thou to me."
Shemot,4,26,"So He let him go; then she said, A choson damim thou art, because of the circumcision."
Shemot,4,27,"And Hashem said to Aharon, Go into the midbar to meet Moshe. And he went, and met him in the Har HaElohim, and kissed him."
Shemot,4,28,"And Moshe told Aharon kol divrei Hashem who had sent him, and all haOtot He had commanded him."
Shemot,4,29,And Moshe and Aharon went and assembled together kol Ziknei Bnei Yisroel;
Shemot,4,30,And Aharon spoke all hadevarim which Hashem had spoken unto Moshe; and he did haOtot before the eyes of HaAm.
Shemot,4,31,"And HaAm believed; and when they heard that Hashem had visited the Bnei Yisroel, and that He had looked upon their oni, then they bowed their heads and worshiped."
Shemot,5,1,"And afterward Moshe and Aharon went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith Hashem Elohei Yisroel, Let My people go, that they may hold a chag (feast) unto Me in the midbar."
Shemot,5,2,"And Pharaoh said, Who is Hashem , that I should obey His voice to let Yisroel go? I know not Hashem , neither will I let Yisroel go."
Shemot,5,3,"And they said, Elohei HaIvrim hath met with us; let us go, now, derech shloshet yamim into the midbar, and sacrifice unto Hashem Eloheinu; lest He fall upon us with dever (cattle disease) , or with the cherev."
Shemot,5,4,"And Melech Mitzrayim said unto them, Why do ye, Moshe and Aharon, disturb the people from their works? Get you back unto your own sevalot (burdens)."
Shemot,5,5,"And Pharaoh said, Hinei, the Am HaAretz now are many, and ye make them rest from their sevalot."
Shemot,5,6,"And Pharaoh commanded the same day the nogesim of the people, and their foremen, saying,"
Shemot,5,7,"Ye shall no more give HaAm straw to make brick, as heretofore; let them go and gather straw for themselves."
Shemot,5,8,"And the matkonet (quota) of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof; for they are idle; therefore they cry out, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to Eloheinu."
Shemot,5,9,"Let there more avodah be laid upon the anashim, that they may labor therein; and let them not regard divrei sheker."
Shemot,5,10,"And the nogesim of HaAm went out, and their foremen; they spoke to HaAm, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw."
Shemot,5,11,"Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it; yet not ought of your avodah shall be diminished."
Shemot,5,12,So HaAm were scattered abroad throughout kol Eretz Mitzrayim to gather stubble instead of straw.
Shemot,5,13,"And the nogesim pressed them, saying, Fulfil your ma'asim, your daily tasks, as when there was straw."
Shemot,5,14,"And the foremen of the Bnei Yisroel, which Pharaohʼs nogesim had set over them, were beaten, and were asked, Why have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and today, as heretofore?"
Shemot,5,15,"Then the foremen of the Bnei Yisroel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Why dealest thou thus with thy avadim?"
Shemot,5,16,"There is no straw given unto thy avadim, and they say to us, Make brick. And, hinei, thy avadim are beaten; but the fault is in thine own people."
Shemot,5,17,"But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and do sacrifice to Hashem."
Shemot,5,18,"Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tokhen (full measure) of bricks."
Shemot,5,19,"And the foremen of the Bnei Yisroel did see that they were in rah (trouble) , after it was said, Ye shall not reduce ought from your bricks of your daily task."
Shemot,5,20,"And they went to meet Moshe and Aharon, who stood waiting to meet them, as they came forth from Pharaoh:"
Shemot,5,21,"And they said unto them, Hashem look upon you, and judge; because ye have made us stench to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his avadim, to put a cherev in their yad to slay us."
Shemot,5,22,"And Moshe returned unto Hashem , and said, Adonoi, why hast Thou brought evil upon this people? why is it that Thou hast sent me?"
Shemot,5,23,"For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Thy Shem, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast Thou delivered Thy people at all."
Shemot,6,1,"Then Hashem said unto Moshe, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh; for through a yad chazakah shall he let them go, and with a yad chazakah shall he drive them out of his land."
Shemot,6,2,"And Elohim spoke unto Moshe, and said unto him, I am Hashem;"
Shemot,6,3,"And I appeared unto Avraham, unto Yitzchak, and unto Ya'akov, as El Shaddai, but by My Shem Hashem I did not make Myself known to them."
Shemot,6,4,"And I have also established My brit (covenant) with them, to give them Eretz Kena'an, the land of their sojourning, wherein they sojourned."
Shemot,6,5,"And I have also heard the groaning of the Bnei Yisroel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered My brit (covenant)."
Shemot,6,6,"Therefore say unto the Bnei Yisroel, I am Hashem , and I will bring you out from under the sivlot Mitzrayim, and I will free you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out zero'a, and with mishpatim gedolim:"
Shemot,6,7,"And I will take you to Me for a people, and I will be to you Elohim; and ye shall know that I am Hashem Eloheichem, which bringeth you out from under the sivlot Mitzrayim."
Shemot,6,8,"And I will bring you in unto HaAretz, concerning the which I did lift up My hand to swear to give it to Avraham, to Yitzchak, and to Ya'akov; and I will give it to you for a morashah (heritage) ; I am Hashem."
Shemot,6,9,"And Moshe spoke so unto the Bnei Yisroel; but they did not listen unto Moshe because of their kotzer ruach (shortness of spirit, broken spirit) , and for avodah kesheh (cruel bondage)."
Shemot,6,10,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe, saying,"
Shemot,6,11,"Go in, speak unto Pharaoh Melech Mitzrayim, that he let the Bnei Yisroel go out of his land."
Shemot,6,12,"And Moshe spoke before Hashem , saying, See, the Bnei Yisroel have not paid heed unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of oral sefatayim (uncircumcised lips, stumbling speech, sealed lips)?"
Shemot,6,13,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe and unto Aharon, and gave them a charge unto the Bnei Yisroel, and unto Pharaoh Melech Mitzrayim, to bring the Bnei Yisroel out of Eretz Mitzrayim."
Shemot,6,14,"These are the Rashei Bais Avotam: The Bnei Reuven the bechor Yisroel; Chanokh, and Pallu, Chetzron, and Carmi: these are the mishpokhot of Reuven."
Shemot,6,15,"And the Bnei Shim'on; Yemuel, and Yamin, and Ohad, and Yachin, and Tzochar, and Sha'ul ben of HaKena'anit: these are the mishpokhot of Shim'on."
Shemot,6,16,"And these are the shemot Bnei Levi according to their toldot; Gershon, and Kohat, and Merari: and the years of the life of Levi were a hundred thirty and seven shanah."
Shemot,6,17,"The Bnei Gershon; Livni, and Shime'i, according to their mishpokhot."
Shemot,6,18,"And the Bnei Kohat; Amram, and Yitzhar, and Chevron, and Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kehat were a hundred thirty and three shanah."
Shemot,6,19,And the Bnei Merari; Machli and Mushi: these are the mishpokhot of Levi according to their toledot.
Shemot,6,20,And Amram took him Yocheved his fatherʼs sister to wife; and she bore him Aharon and Moshe: and the years of the life of Amram were a hundred and thirty and seven shanah.
Shemot,6,21,"And the Bnei Yitzhar; Korach, Nepheg, and Zichri."
Shemot,6,22,"And the Bnei Uzziel; Mishael, Eltzaphan, and Sitri."
Shemot,6,23,"And Aharon took him Elisheva, bat Amminadav, achot Nachshon, to wife; and she bore him Nadav, and Avihu, El'azar and Itamar."
Shemot,6,24,"And the Bnei Korach; Assir, and Elkanah, and Aviasaph: these are the mishpokhot of the Korchi."
Shemot,6,25,And El'azar ben Aharon took him one of the banot Putiel to wife; and she bore him Pinchas: these are the Rashei Avot HaLevi'im according to their mishpokhot.
Shemot,6,26,"These are that Aharon and Moshe, to whom Hashem said, Bring out the Bnei Yisroel from Eretz Mitzrayim according to their tzve'os."
Shemot,6,27,"These are they which spoke to Pharaoh Melech Mitzrayim, to bring out the Bnei Yisroel from Mitzrayim: these are that Moshe and Aharon."
Shemot,6,28,"And it came to pass on the day when Hashem spoke unto Moshe in Eretz Mitzrayim,"
Shemot,6,29,"That Hashem spoke unto Moshe, saying, I am Hashem : speak thou unto Pharaoh Melech Mitzrayim all that I say unto thee."
Shemot,6,30,"And Moshe said before Hashem , See, I am of oral sefatayim, and why should Pharaoh pay heed unto me."
Shemot,7,1,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, See, I have made thee as Elohim to Pharaoh: and Aharon thy brother shall be thy navi."
Shemot,7,2,"Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aharon thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the Bnei Yisroel out of his land."
Shemot,7,3,"And I will harden the lev Pharaoh, and multiply My Otot and My Mofetim in Eretz Mitzrayim."
Shemot,7,4,"But Pharaoh shall not pay heed unto you, that I may lay My yad upon Mitzrayim, and bring forth Mine tzve'os, and My people the Bnei Yisroel, out of Eretz Mitzrayim by shefatim gedolim (great judgments)."
Shemot,7,5,"And the Egyptians shall know that I am Hashem , when I stretch forth My yad upon Mitzrayim, bringing out Bnei Yisroel from among them."
Shemot,7,6,"And Moshe and Aharon did as Hashem commanded them, so did they."
Shemot,7,7,"And Moshe was fourscore years old, and Aharon fourscore three years, when they spoke unto Pharaoh."
Shemot,7,8,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe and Aharon, saying,"
Shemot,7,9,"When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Show a mofet (miracle) for you: then thou shalt say unto Aharon, Take thy matteh, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent."
Shemot,7,10,"And Moshe and Aharon went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as Hashem had commanded: and Aharon cast down his matteh before Pharaoh, and his avadim, and it became a serpent."
Shemot,7,11,"Then Pharaoh also called the chachamim and the mechashefim: now the charetumei Mitzrayim, they also did in like manner with their secret lore."
Shemot,7,12,"For they cast down every man his matteh, and they became serpents: but the matteh Aharon swallowed up their mattot."
Shemot,7,13,"And He hardened lev Pharaoh, that he paid heed not unto them; as Hashem had said."
Shemot,7,14,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, the lev Pharaoh is hardened, he refuseth to let the people go."
Shemot,7,15,"Get thee unto Pharaoh in the boker; hinei, he goeth out unto the mayim; and thou shalt stand by the bank of the Nile to meet him; and the matteh which was turned to a nachash shalt thou take in thine yad."
Shemot,7,16,"And thou shalt say unto him, Hashem Elohei HaIvrim hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let My people go, that they may serve Me in the midbar: and, hinei, hitherto thou wouldest not hear."
Shemot,7,17,"Thus saith Hashem , In this thou shalt know that I am Hashem : hinei, I will strike with the matteh that is in Mine yad upon the mayim which are in the Nile, and they shall be turned to dahm."
Shemot,7,18,"And the dag (fish) that is in the Nile shall die, and the Nile shall stink; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink of the mayim of the Nile."
Shemot,7,19,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe, Say unto Aharon, Take thy matteh, and stretch out thine yad upon the mayim of Mitzrayim, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their mikveh of mayim, that they may become dahm; and that there may be dahm throughout kol Eretz Mitzrayim, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone."
Shemot,7,20,"And Moshe and Aharon did so, as Hashem commanded; and he lifted up the matteh, and smote the waters that were in the Nile, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his avadim; and all the mayim that were in the Nile were turned to dahm."
Shemot,7,21,"And the dag (fish) that was in the Nile died; and the Nile stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the mayim of the Nile; and there was dahm throughout kol Eretz Mitzrayim."
Shemot,7,22,"And the charetumei Mitzrayim did so with their secret lore: and lev Pharaoh was hardened, neither did he pay heed unto them; as Hashem had said."
Shemot,7,23,"And Pharaoh turned and went into his bais, neither did he set his mind to this also."
Shemot,7,24,And all the Egyptians dug around the Nile for mayim to drink; they could not drink of the mayim of the Nile.
Shemot,7,25,"And seven days came and went, after Hashem had struck the Nile."
Shemot,8,1,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith Hashem , Let My people go, that they may serve Me."
Shemot,8,2,"And if thou refuse to let them go, hinei, I will strike all thy borders with tzefardaya:"
Shemot,8,3,"And the river shall bring forth tzefardaya abundantly, which shall go up and come into thine bais, and into thy cheder mishkav, and upon thy bed, and into the bais of thy avadim, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneading bowls:"
Shemot,8,4,"And the tzefardaya shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy avadim."
Shemot,8,5,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe, Say unto Aharon, Stretch forth thine yad with thy matteh over the streams, over the rivers, and ponds, and cause tzefardaya to come up upon Eretz Mitzrayim."
Shemot,8,6,"And Aharon stretched out his yad over the waters of Mitzrayim; and the tzefardaya came up, and covered Eretz Mitzrayim."
Shemot,8,7,"And the chartumim did so with their secret lore, and brought up tzefardaya upon Eretz Mitzrayim."
Shemot,8,8,"Then Pharaoh called for Moshe and Aharon, and said, Entreat Hashem , that He may take away the tzefardaya from me, and from My people; and I will let HaAm go, that they may do sacrifice unto Hashem."
Shemot,8,9,"And Moshe said unto Pharaoh, Please thyself over me: when shall I entreat for thee, and for thy avadim, and for thy people, to destroy the tzefardaya from thee and thy batim (houses) , that they may remain in the Nile only?"
Shemot,8,10,"And he said, Tomorrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word: that thou mayest know that there is none like unto Hashem Eloheinu."
Shemot,8,11,"And the tzefardaya shall depart from thee, from thy batim, from thy avadim, and from thy people; they shall remain in the Nile only."
Shemot,8,12,And Moshe and Aharon went out from Pharaoh: and Moshe cried unto Hashem because of the tzefardaya which He had brought against Pharaoh.
Shemot,8,13,"And Hashem did according to the word of Moshe; and the tzefardaya died out of the batim (houses) , out of the khatzerot, and out of the sadot."
Shemot,8,14,And they gathered them together upon heaps; and the land stank.
Shemot,8,15,"But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his lev, and paid heed not unto them; as Hashem had said."
Shemot,8,16,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, Say unto Aharon, Stretch out thy matteh, and smite the aphar ha'aretz, that it may become kinim throughout kol Eretz Mitzrayim."
Shemot,8,17,"And they did so; for Aharon stretched out his yad with his matteh, and smote the aphar ha'aretz, and it became kinim in adam, and in behemah; all the aphar ha'aretz became kinim throughout kol Eretz Mitzrayim."
Shemot,8,18,"And the chartumim did so with their secret lore to bring forth kinim, but they could not: so there were kinim upon adam, and upon behemah."
Shemot,8,19,"Then the chartumim said unto Pharaoh, This is the Etzba Elohim (Finger of G-d) : and the lev Pharaoh was hardened, and he paid heed not unto them; as Hashem had said."
Shemot,8,20,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, Rise up early in the boker, and stand before Pharaoh; hinei, he cometh forth to the mayim; and say unto him, Thus saith Hashem , Let My people go, that they may serve Me."
Shemot,8,21,"Else, if thou wilt not let My people go, hineni, I will send swarms of arov upon thee, and upon thy avadim, and upon thy people, and into thy batim (houses) ; and the batim (houses) of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of arov, and also the ground whereon they are."
Shemot,8,22,"And I will deal differently in that day with Eretz Goshen, in which My people dwell, that no swarms of arov shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am Hashem in the midst of the earth."
Shemot,8,23,And I will put a distinction between My people and thy people; tomorrow shall this Ot be.
Shemot,8,24,"And Hashem did so; there came a grievous swarm of arov into the bais Pharaoh, into batim of his avadim, into kol Eretz Mitzrayim; the land was corrupted from the swarm of arov."
Shemot,8,25,"And Pharaoh called for Moshe, for Aharon, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to Eloheichem in the land."
Shemot,8,26,"And Moshe said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the to'avot Egyptians to Hashem Eloheinu; lo, shall we sacrifice the to'avot Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?"
Shemot,8,27,"We will go derech shloshet yamim into the midbar, and sacrifice to Hashem Eloheinu, as He shall command us."
Shemot,8,28,"And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to Hashem Eloheichem in the midbar; only ye shall not go very far away; entreat for me."
Shemot,8,29,"And Moshe said, Hinei, I go out from thee, and I will entreat Hashem that the swarms of arov may depart from Pharaoh, from his avadim, and from his people, tomorrow; but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully anymore in not letting the people go to sacrifice to Hashem."
Shemot,8,30,"And Moshe went out from Pharaoh, and entreated Hashem."
Shemot,8,31,"And Hashem did according to the devar Moshe; and He removed the swarms of arov from Pharaoh, from his avadim, from his people; there remained not one."
Shemot,8,32,"And Pharaoh hardened his lev at this time also, neither would he let the people go."
Shemot,9,1,"Then Hashem said unto Moshe, Go in unto Pharaoh, tell him, Thus saith Hashem Elohei HaIvrim, Let My people go, that they may serve Me."
Shemot,9,2,"For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still,"
Shemot,9,3,"Hinei, the Yad Hashem is upon thy mikneh (livestock) which is in the sadeh, upon the susim, upon the donkeys, upon the camels, upon the herd, and upon the tzon; there shall be a very grievous dever."
Shemot,9,4,And Hashem shall separate between the mikneh Yisroel and the mikneh Mitzrayim; and there shall nothing die of all that belongs to the Bnei Yisroel.
Shemot,9,5,"And Hashem appointed a mo'ed, saying, Tomorrow Hashem shall do this thing in the land."
Shemot,9,6,"And Hashem did that thing on the next day, and all the mikneh of Mitzrayim died; but of the mikneh of the Bnei Yisroel died not one."
Shemot,9,7,"And Pharaoh sent, and, hinei, there was not one of the mikneh Yisroel dead. And the lev Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let HaAm go."
Shemot,9,8,"And Hashem said unto Moshe and unto Aharon, Take to you handfuls of piach of the furnace, and let Moshe sprinkle it toward Shomayim in the sight of Pharaoh."
Shemot,9,9,"And it shall become fine dust in kol Eretz Mitzrayim, and shall be a sh'khin (boil) breaking forth with festers upon adam, and upon behemah, throughout kol Eretz Mitzrayim."
Shemot,9,10,"And they took piach of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moshe sprinkled it up toward Shomayim; and it became a sh'khin breaking forth with festers upon adam, and upon behemah."
Shemot,9,11,"And the charetumim could not stand before Moshe because of the sh'khin; for the sh'khin was upon the charetumim, and upon kol Mitzrayim."
Shemot,9,12,"And Hashem hardened the lev Pharaoh, and he paid heed not unto them; as Hashem had spoken unto Moshe."
Shemot,9,13,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, Rise up early in the boker, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith Hashem Elohei HaIvrim, Let My people go, that they may serve Me."
Shemot,9,14,"For I will at this time send all My maggefot upon thine lev, and upon thy avadim, and upon thy people; that thou mayest have da'as that there is none like Me in kol ha'aretz."
Shemot,9,15,"For now I will stretch out My Yad, that I may strike thee and thy people with dever; and thou shalt be cut off from ha'aretz."
Shemot,9,16,"In fact for this cause have I raised thee up, for to show in thee My ko'ach; and that My Shem may be declared throughout kol ha'aretz."
Shemot,9,17,"Thou still are exalting thyself against My people, that thou wilt not let them go."
Shemot,9,18,"Hinei, tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain very grievous barad (hail) , such as hath not been in Mitzrayim since the foundation thereof even until now."
Shemot,9,19,"Send therefore now, and gather thy mikneh, and all that thou hast in the sadeh; for upon every adam (man) and behemah (beast) which shall be found in the sadeh, and shall not be brought into shelter, the barad shall come down upon them, and they shall die."
Shemot,9,20,He that feared the Devar Hashem among the avadim of Pharaoh made his avadim and his mikneh flee into the shelters;
Shemot,9,21,And he that took not to heart the Devar Hashem left his avadim and his mikneh in the sadeh.
Shemot,9,22,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, Stretch forth thine yad toward Shomayim, that there may be barad in kol Eretz Mitzrayim, upon adam, and upon behemah, and upon kol esev hasadeh, throughout Eretz Mitzrayim."
Shemot,9,23,"And Moshe stretched forth his matteh toward Shomayim; and Hashem sent thunder and barad, and the eish flashed down upon the ground; and Hashem rained barad upon Eretz Mitzrayim."
Shemot,9,24,"So there was barad, and eish mingled with the barad, very grievous, such as there was none like it in kol Eretz Mitzrayim since it became a nation."
Shemot,9,25,"And the barad struck throughout kol Eretz Mitzrayim all that was in the sadeh, both adam and behemah; the barad struck kol esev hasadeh, and beat down kol etz of the sadeh."
Shemot,9,26,"Only in Eretz Goshen, where the Bnei Yisroel were, was there no barad."
Shemot,9,27,"And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moshe and Aharon, and said unto them, chatati (I have sinned) this time: Hashem HaTzaddik (is righteous) , and I and my people are haresha'im (wicked, guilty, wrong)."
Shemot,9,28,"Entreat Hashem for it is enough, that there be no more Elohim thunderings and barad; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer."
Shemot,9,29,"And Moshe said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the Ir, I will spread out my palms unto Hashem ; and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more barad; that thou mayest have da'as that ha'aretz is Hashem ʼs."
Shemot,9,30,"But as for thee and thy avadim, I know that ye will not yet fear Hashem Elohim."
Shemot,9,31,"And the flax and the barley was struck; for the barley was ripe, and the flax was in bud."
Shemot,9,32,But the wheat and the spelt were not struck; for they were not yet come up.
Shemot,9,33,"And Moshe went out of the Ir from Pharaoh, and spread out his palms unto Hashem ; and the thunders and barad ceased, and the rain was not poured upon ha'aretz."
Shemot,9,34,"And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the barad and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his lev, he and his avadim."
Shemot,9,35,"And the lev Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the Bnei Yisroel go; as Hashem had spoken by Moshe."
Shemot,10,1,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, Go in unto Pharaoh; for I have hardened his lev, and the lev of his avadim, that I might show these My otot before him;"
Shemot,10,2,"And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy ben, and of thy benʼs ben, what things I have wrought in Mitzrayim, and My otot which I have done among them; that ye may have da'as that I am Hashem."
Shemot,10,3,"And Moshe and Aharon came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith Hashem Elohei HaIvrim, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before Me? Let My people go, that they may serve Me."
Shemot,10,4,"Else, if thou refuse to let My people go, hineni, tomorrow will I bring the arbeh into thy border;"
Shemot,10,5,"And they shall cover the face of ha'aretz, that one cannot be able to see ha'aretz; and they shall devour the remnant of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the barad, and shall eat kol haetz which groweth for you out of the sadeh;"
Shemot,10,6,"And they shall fill thy batim (houses) , and the batim (houses) of all thy avadim, and the batim (houses) of kol Mitzrayim; which neither thy avot, nor the avot of thy avot have seen, since the day that they were upon ha'aretz unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh."
Shemot,10,7,"And Pharaohʼs avadim said unto him, How long shall this man be a mokesh (snare) unto us? Let the anashim go, that they may serve Hashem Eloheihem; knowest thou not yet that Mitzrayim is destroyed?"
Shemot,10,8,"And Moshe and Aharon were brought again unto Pharaoh; and he said unto them, Go, serve Hashem Eloheichem; but who are they that shall go?"
Shemot,10,9,"And Moshe said, We will go with ne'areinu and with zekeineinu, with baneinu and with benoteinu, with tzoneinu and with bekareinu (our herds) will we go; for Chag Hashem lanu."
Shemot,10,10,"And he said unto them, Hashem will indeed be with you, if ever I let you go, and your little ones; look to it, evil [intent] is before you."
Shemot,10,11,"Not so; go now ye that are gevarim, and serve Hashem ; for that ye did request. And they were driven out from Pharaohʼs presence."
Shemot,10,12,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, Stretch out thine yad over Eretz Mitzrayim for the arbeh, that they may come up upon Eretz Mitzrayim, and devour kol esev ha'aretz, even all that the barad hath left as remnant."
Shemot,10,13,"And Moshe stretched forth his matteh over Eretz Mitzrayim, and Hashem brought a ruach kadim upon the land all that yom, and all that lailah; and when it was boker, the ruach hakadim brought the arbeh."
Shemot,10,14,"And the arbeh went up over kol Eretz Mitzrayim, and rested on the entire border of Mitzrayim: very grievous were they; before them there were no such arbeh as they, neither after them shall be such."
Shemot,10,15,"For they covered the kol ha'aretz, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat kol esev ha'aretz, and kol p'ri haetz which the barad had left as remnant; and there remained not any yerek baetz, or in the esev hasadeh, through kol Eretz Mitzrayim."
Shemot,10,16,"Then Pharaoh called for Moshe and Aharon in haste; and he said, chatati (I have sinned) against Hashem Eloheichem, and against you."
Shemot,10,17,"Therefore forgive, now, my sin only this once, and entreat Hashem Eloheichem, that He would only take away from me this mavet."
Shemot,10,18,"And he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated Hashem."
Shemot,10,19,"And Hashem turned a west ruach chazak me'od, which took away the arbeh, and cast them into the Yam Suf; there remained not one arbeh in all the borders of Mitzrayim."
Shemot,10,20,"But Hashem hardened lev Pharaoh, so that he would not let the Bnei Yisroel go."
Shemot,10,21,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, Stretch out thine yad toward Shomayim, that there may be choshech over Eretz Mitzrayim, even choshech which he can feel."
Shemot,10,22,And Moshe stretched forth his yad toward Shomayim; and there was a thick choshech in kol Eretz Mitzrayim shloshet yamim;
Shemot,10,23,"They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for shloshet yamim; but kol Bnei Yisroel had Ohr in their dwellings."
Shemot,10,24,"And Pharaoh called unto Moshe, and said, Go ye, serve Hashem ; only let your tzon and your herds remain behind; let your little ones also go with you."
Shemot,10,25,"And Moshe said, Thou must give us also zevakhim and olot, that we may sacrifice unto Hashem Eloheinu."
Shemot,10,26,"Also mikneinu shall go with us; there shall not a hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve Hashem Eloheinu; and we know not with what we must serve Hashem , until we come to there."
Shemot,10,27,"But Hashem hardened lev Pharaoh, and he would not let them go."
Shemot,10,28,"And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die."
Shemot,10,29,"And Moshe said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more."
Shemot,11,1,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, Yet will I bring one nega (plague; see Isa 53:8 regarding Moshiach) more upon Pharaoh, and upon Mitzrayim; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let you go, he shall surely drive you out hence altogether."
Shemot,11,2,"Speak now in the ears of HaAm, let every ish request of his neighbor, every isha of her neighbor, articles of kesef and articles of zahav."
Shemot,11,3,"And Hashem gave the people chen in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the ish Moshe was gadol me'od in Eretz Mitzrayim, in the sight of Pharaohʼs avadim, and in the sight of the people."
Shemot,11,4,"And Moshe said, Thus saith Hashem , About khatzot halailah (midnight) will I go out into the midst of Mitzrayim;"
Shemot,11,5,"And all the bechor in Eretz Mitzrayim shall die, from the bechor Pharaoh that sitteth upon his kisse, even unto the bechor hashifchah that is behind the millstone; and all the bechor behemah."
Shemot,11,6,"And there shall be a great cry throughout kol Eretz Mitzrayim, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more."
Shemot,11,7,"But against any of the Bnei Yisroel shall not a kelev move his leshon, against ish or behemah; that ye may have da'as that Hashem doth differentiate between Mitzrayim and Yisroel."
Shemot,11,8,"And all these thy avadim shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and kol HaAm that follow thee; and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger."
Shemot,11,9,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, Pharaoh shall not pay heed unto you; that My mofetim may be multiplied in Eretz Mitzrayim."
Shemot,11,10,"And Moshe and Aharon did all these mofetim before Pharaoh; and Hashem hardened lev Pharaoh, so that he would not let the Bnei Yisroel go out of his land."
Shemot,12,1,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe and Aharon in Eretz Mitzrayim saying,"
Shemot,12,2,Hachodesh hazeh (this month) shall be unto you the beginning of months; it shall be the first month of the year to you.
Shemot,12,3,"Speak ye unto kol Adat Yisroel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a seh (lamb), according to the bais avot, a seh for each bais;"
Shemot,12,4,"And if the household be too small for the seh (lamb), let him and his neighbor next unto his bais take according to the number of the nefashot; every ish according to what he eats shall make up your count for the seh."
Shemot,12,5,"Your seh (lamb) shall be tamim (without blemish) , a zachar (male) within its first year; ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats;"
Shemot,12,6,"And it will be with you for mishmeret (examination, checking for blemishes) up until the fourteenth day of the same month; and kol Kehal Adat Yisroel shall slaughter (shachat) it in the afternoon [before dark]."
Shemot,12,7,"And they shall take of the dahm, and strike it upon the two mezuzot (doorposts) and on the mashkof (lintel) of the batim (houses) , wherein they shall eat it."
Shemot,12,8,"And they shall eat the basar in that night, roasted over eish, and matzot; and with maror they shall eat it."
Shemot,12,9,"Eat not of it raw, nor soaked or boiled in mayim, but roasted over eish; this includes its rosh with its legs, and with the inner parts thereof."
Shemot,12,10,And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the boker; and that which remaineth of it until the boker ye shall burn with eish.
Shemot,12,11,"And thus shall ye eat it; with your robe girded up, your sandals on your feet, and your walking staff in your yad; and ye shall eat it with urgent haste; it is Hashem ʼs Pesach."
Shemot,12,12,"For I will pass through Eretz Mitzrayim balailah hazeh, and will strike fatally kol bechor Eretz Mitzrayim, both adam and behemah; and against all the elohei Mitzrayim I will execute judgment; I am Hashem."
Shemot,12,13,"And the dahm shall be for you, an ot (sign) upon the batim (houses) where ye are; and when I see the dahm, oofasachti (then I will pass over, skip, spare) you [plural], and the negef (plague, blow, striking, i.e., death of firstborn) shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I strike fatally with a blow against Eretz Mitzrayim."
Shemot,12,14,"And hayom hazeh shall be unto you for zikaron (remembrance, remembering) ; and ye shall keep it a Chag (Feast) to Hashem throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a Chag (Feast) by a chukkat olam."
Shemot,12,15,"Shivat yamim shall ye eat matzot; but the first day ye shall put away se'or (yeast, leaven) out of your batim (houses) ; for whosoever eateth chametz from the first day until the seventh day, that nefesh shall be cut off from Yisroel."
Shemot,12,16,"And in the yom harishon there shall be a mikra kodesh, and in the yom hashevi'i there shall be a mikra kodesh to you; no manner of melachah shall be done in them, except that which every nefesh must eat, that only may be done of you."
Shemot,12,17,And ye shall be shomer to safeguard the matzot; for on this very day I brought your tzva'os out of Eretz Mitzrayim; therefore shall ye be shomer over this day in your generations by a chukkat olam.
Shemot,12,18,"In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at erev, ye shall eat matzot, until the one and twentieth day of the month at erev."
Shemot,12,19,"Shivat yamim shall there be no se'or (yeast, leaven) found in your batim (houses) ; whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that nefesh shall be cut off from Adat Yisroel, whether he be a ger, or native born in ha'aretz."
Shemot,12,20,Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your dwelling-places shall ye eat matzot.
Shemot,12,21,"Then Moshe called for all the Ziknei Yisroel, and said unto them, Draw out as separate and take for yourselves a lamb according to your mishpokhot, and slaughter (shachat) the Pesach."
Shemot,12,22,"And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the dahm that is in the basin, and strike the mashkof (lintel) and the two mezuzot (door sideposts) with the dahm that is in the basin; and none of you shall go out the door of his bais until boker."
Shemot,12,23,"For Hashem will pass through to strike the Mitzrayim; and when He seeth the dahm upon the mashkof, and on the two mezuzot, Hashem will pasach (pass over, spare, skip) the entrance, and will not permit the Mashkhit (Destroyer), to enter unto your batim to strike."
Shemot,12,24,And ye shall be shomer over this word as a chok (ordinance) to thee and your children ad olam (forever).
Shemot,12,25,"And it shall come to pass, when ye come to ha'aretz which Hashem will give to you, according as He hath promised, that ye shall be shomer over this avodah."
Shemot,12,26,"And it shall come to pass, when your banim shall say unto you, Mah haavodah hazot lachem (What is this avodah to you)?"
Shemot,12,27,"That ye shall say, It is the zevach of Hashem ʼs Pesach, who pasach (passed over, skipped, spared) the batim (households) of the Bnei Yisroel in Mitzrayim, when He struck down the Egyptians, and spared bateinu (our houses) . And the people bowed down and worshiped."
Shemot,12,28,"And the Bnei Yisroel went away, and did as Hashem had commanded Moshe and Aharon, so did they."
Shemot,12,29,"And it came to pass, that at midnight Hashem struck down kol bechor in Eretz Mitzrayim, from the bechor of Pharaoh sitting on his throne unto the bechor of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the bechor behemah."
Shemot,12,30,"And Pharaoh rose up in the lailah, he, and all his avadim, and kol Mitzrayim; and there was a tze'akah gedolah (great wail) in Mitzrayim; for there was not a bais where there was not one dead."
Shemot,12,31,"And he called for Moshe and Aharon by night, and said, Rise up, and get you forth, leave from among my people, both ye and the Bnei Yisroel; and go, serve Hashem , as ye have said."
Shemot,12,32,"Also take your tzon and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also."
Shemot,12,33,"And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of ha'aretz in haste; for they said, Kullanu mesim (We are all dead ones)."
Shemot,12,34,"And the people took their batzek (deaf dough, having no indication of fermentation) before it was leavened, their kneading pans being wrapped up in their clothes [and carried] upon their shoulders."
Shemot,12,35,"And the Bnei Yisroel did according to the devar Moshe; they requested of the Egyptians k'lei kesef, and k'lei zahav, and garments;"
Shemot,12,36,"And Hashem gave the people favor in the sight of the Mitzrayim, so that they granted their request. So they plundered the Egyptians."
Shemot,12,37,"And the Bnei Yisroel journeyed from Ra'meses towards Sukkot, about 600,000 gevarim on foot, not counting women and children."
Shemot,12,38,"And an erev rav (mixed multitude, a mixed company that was large) went along also with them; and tzon, and herds, even very many domestic animals."
Shemot,12,39,"And they baked the batzek (deaf dough) which they brought forth out of Mitzrayim, into round flat cakes of matzot; ki lo chametz, because they were thrust out of Mitzrayim, and could not tarry (linger) , neither had they prepared for tzeidah (supply of food, provision)."
Shemot,12,40,Now the moshav (time period of residence) of the Bnei Yisroel dwelling in Mitzrayim was four hundred and thirty shanah.
Shemot,12,41,"And it came to pass at the ketz (end) of the four hundred and thirty shanah, even the exact day it came to pass, that kol Tzivos Hashem went out from Eretz Mitzrayim."
Shemot,12,42,"It is a night of shimmurim (keepings, watchings, vigils) for Hashem to keep watch to bring them out from Eretz Mitzrayim; this is halailah hazeh unto Hashem ; shimmurim (watchings, vigils) for kol Bnei Yisroel in their dorot."
Shemot,12,43,"And Hashem said unto Moshe and Aharon, This is the Chukkat HaPesach: there shall no ben nekhar eat thereof;"
Shemot,12,44,"But every manʼs eved that is bought for kesef, when thou hast given him bris milah, then shall he eat thereof."
Shemot,12,45,A toshav and a sachir shall not eat thereof.
Shemot,12,46,In bais echad shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth any of the basar outside the bais; neither shall ye break a bone thereof.
Shemot,12,47,Kol Adat Yisroel shall celebrate it.
Shemot,12,48,"And when a ger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the Pesach unto Hashem , let all his zachar receive bris milah, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is native born in ha'aretz; for no arel (uncircumcised person) shall eat thereof."
Shemot,12,49,"Torah echad shall be to him that is native-born, and unto the ger that sojourneth among you."
Shemot,12,50,"Thus did kol Bnei Yisroel; as Hashem commanded Moshe and Aharon, so did they."
Shemot,12,51,"And it came to pass the very same day, that Hashem did bring the Bnei Yisroel out of Eretz Mitzrayim by their tzvaos."
Shemot,13,1,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe, saying,"
Shemot,13,2,"Set apart as kodesh unto Me kol bechor, whatsoever openeth the rechem (womb) among the Bnei Yisroel, both of adam and of behemah; it is Mine."
Shemot,13,3,"And Moshe said unto HaAm, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Mitzrayim, out of the bais avadim; for by chozek yad Hashem brought you out from this place; there shall no chametz be eaten."
Shemot,13,4,This day came ye out in the month Aviv.
Shemot,13,5,"And it shall be when Hashem shall bring thee into the land of the Kena'ani, and the Chitti, and the Emori, and the Chivi, and the Yevusi, which He swore unto thy Avot to give thee, an eretz flowing with cholov and devash, that thou shalt observe this avodah (service) in this month."
Shemot,13,6,"Shivat yamim thou shalt eat matzot, and in the seventh day shall be a Chag (Feast) to Hashem."
Shemot,13,7,"Matzot shall be eaten shivat hayamim; and there shall no chametz be seen with thee, neither shall there be se'or seen with thee within all thy borders."
Shemot,13,8,"And thou shalt show thy ben in that day, saying, This is because of what Hashem did for me when I came forth out of Mitzrayim."
Shemot,13,9,"And it shall be for an ot (sign) unto thee upon thine yad, and for a zikaron (reminder) between thine eyes, in order that the torat Hashem may be in thy mouth; because with a yad chazakah hath Hashem brought thee out of Mitzrayim."
Shemot,13,10,"Thou shalt therefore be shomer over this chukkah in its mo'ed (season, fixed time) perpetually."
Shemot,13,11,"And it shall be when Hashem shall bring thee into the land of the Kena'ani, as He swore unto thee and to thy avot, and shall give it thee,"
Shemot,13,12,"That thou shalt set apart unto Hashem all that openeth the rechem (womb) , and every firstling that is born of a behemah which thou hast; hazecharim (the males) shall be Hashem ʼs."
Shemot,13,13,"And every firstling of a he-donkey thou shalt redeem with a seh; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break its neck; and kol bechor adam among thy banim shalt thou redeem."
Shemot,13,14,"And it shall be when thy ben asketh thee in time to come, saying, Mah zot? (What is this?) that thou shalt say unto him, By chozek yad Hashem brought us out from Mitzrayim, from the bais avadim;"
Shemot,13,15,"And it came to pass, when Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, that Hashem killed kol bechor of Eretz Mitzrayim, both the bechor adam, and the bechor behemah; therefore Ani zovei'ach la Hashem (I sacrifice to Hashem) kol that openeth the rechem (womb) , being hazecharim (the males) ; but kol bechor of my banim I redeem."
Shemot,13,16,"And it shall be for an ot (sign) upon thine hand, and for totafos (ornaments, frontlets, bands, phylactery) between thine eyes; for by chozek yad Hashem brought us forth out of Mitzrayim."
Shemot,13,17,"And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that Elohim led them not through the derech of the eretz of the Pelishtim (Philistines) , although that was near; for Elohim said, Lest perhaps the people change their mind when they see milchamah, and they return to Mitzrayim;"
Shemot,13,18,"So Elohim led HaAm about, through the derech of the midbar of the Yam Suf; and the Bnei Yisroel went up out of Eretz Mitzrayim ready for battle."
Shemot,13,19,"And Moshe took the atzmot Yosef with him; for Yosef had made the Bnei Yisroel swear unconditionally, saying, Elohim will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my atzmot away from here with you."
Shemot,13,20,"And they took their journey from Sukkot, and encamped in Etam, at the edge of the midbar."
Shemot,13,21,"And Hashem went before them by day in an ammud anan, to guide them haderech; and by lailah in an ammud eish, to give them ohr; so they could travel yomam valailah (day or night);"
Shemot,13,22,"He took not away the ammud heanan by day, nor the ammud haeish by night, from before HaAm."
Shemot,14,1,"Then Hashem spoke unto Moshe, saying,"
Shemot,14,2,"Speak unto the Bnei Yisroel, that they turn back and encamp before Pi-Hachirot, between Migdol and the yam, in front of Ba'al-Tzephon; opposite it shall ye encamp by the yam."
Shemot,14,3,"For Pharaoh will think of the Bnei Yisroel, They are entangled in the land, the midbar hath shut them in."
Shemot,14,4,"And I will harden lev Pharaoh, that he shall pursue after them; and I will be glorified over Pharaoh, and upon all his army; so that the Egyptians may have da'as that I am Hashem . And they did accordingly."
Shemot,14,5,"And it was told the melech Mitzrayim that HaAm had fled; and the lev Pharaoh and of his avadim was turned against HaAm, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Yisroel go from slaving for us?"
Shemot,14,6,"And he made ready his merkavah, and took his army with him;"
Shemot,14,7,"And he took six hundred select chariots, and all the chariots of Mitzrayim, and commanders over every one of them."
Shemot,14,8,"And Hashem hardened the lev Pharaoh Melech Mitzrayim, so that he pursued after the Bnei Yisroel; and the Bnei Yisroel went out with a high hand."
Shemot,14,9,"But the Mitzrayim pursued after them, all the susim and chariots of Pharaoh, and his parash, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the yam, by Pi-Hachirot, in front of Ba'al-Tzephon."
Shemot,14,10,"And when Pharaoh drew near, the Bnei Yisroel lifted up their eyes, and, hinei, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were very terrified; and the Bnei Yisroel cried out unto Hashem."
Shemot,14,11,"And they said unto Moshe, Because there were no kevarim in Mitzrayim, hast thou taken us away to die in the midbar? What hast thou done to us, in bringing us forth out of Mitzrayim?"
Shemot,14,12,"Is not this the very thing that we did tell thee in Mitzrayim, saying, Let us alone, that we may slave for the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to slave for the Egyptians, than that we should die in the midbar."
Shemot,14,13,"And Moshe said unto HaAm, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the Yeshu'at Hashem , which He will bring to you today; for the Egyptians whom ye have seen today, ye shall see them again no more ad olam."
Shemot,14,14," Hashem shall fight for you, and ye shall keep still."
Shemot,14,15,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, Why criest thou unto Me? Speak unto the Bnei Yisroel, so that they move on;"
Shemot,14,16,"But lift thou up thy staff, and stretch out thine yad over the yam, and divide it; and the Bnei Yisroel shall go on yabashah (dry land) through the midst of the yam."
Shemot,14,17,"And I, hineni, I will harden the lev Mitzrayim, and they shall go after them; and I will get Me glory over Pharaoh, and over all his army, over his chariots, and upon his parash (horsemen)."
Shemot,14,18,"And the Egyptians shall know that I am Hashem , when I have gotten Me glory over Pharaoh, over his chariots, and over his parash."
Shemot,14,19,"And the Malach HaElohim, which goes in front of the Machaneh Yisroel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved from before their face, and stood behind them;"
Shemot,14,20,"And it came between the machaneh Mitzrayim and the Machaneh Yisroel; there was the anan bringing choshech to the Egyptians, but bringing light by night to Yisroel; so that none came near the other, kol halailah."
Shemot,14,21,"Then Moshe stretched out his yad over the yam; and Hashem caused the yam to go back by a strong east wind all that night, so that the yam was made dry land, and the mayim were divided."
Shemot,14,22,"And the Bnei Yisroel then went into the middle of the yam upon the yabashah (dry land) ; and the mayim were a chomah (wall) unto them on their right, and on their left."
Shemot,14,23,"And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them into the middle of the yam, even kol sus Pharaoh, his chariots, and his parash."
Shemot,14,24,"So it came to pass, that when came the watch of the boker, Hashem looked down on the machaneh Mitzrayim through the ammud eish (pillar of fire) and of the anan, and caused confusion over the machaneh Mitzrayim,"
Shemot,14,25,"And turned awry their chariot wheels, that they drove them with difficulty; so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the presence of Yisroel; because Hashem fighteth for them against the Egyptians."
Shemot,14,26,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, Stretch out thine yad over the yam, that the mayim may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their parash."
Shemot,14,27,"And Moshe stretched forth his yad over the yam, and the yam rushed back to its place as dawn of the boker appeared; and the Egyptians tried to flee away from meeting it; but Hashem swept the Egyptians into the middle of the yam."
Shemot,14,28,"And the mayim rushed back, and covered the chariots, and the parashim, and all the army of Pharaoh that came into the yam after them; there remained as survivors not so much as one of them."
Shemot,14,29,"But the Bnei Yisroel walked upon yabashah through the yam; and the mayim were a chomah unto them on their right, and on their left."
Shemot,14,30,Thus Hashem saved Yisroel yom hahu out of the hand of Mitzrayim; and Yisroel saw the Egyptians dead upon the seashore.
Shemot,14,31,"And Yisroel saw the yad hagedolah which Hashem did upon the Egyptians; and HaAm feared Hashem , and put their trust in Hashem , and in His eved Moshe."
Shemot,15,1,"Then sang Moshe and the Bnei Yisroel this shirah (song) to Hashem , and spoke, saying, I will sing unto Hashem , for He hath triumphed gloriously: the sus and its rider hath He cast into the yam."
Shemot,15,2," Hashem is my oz and zimrah (song of praise) , and He is become to me Yeshu'ah (salvation) ; He is Eli (my G-d) , and I will praise Him; Elohei Avi, and I will exalt Him."
Shemot,15,3, Hashem is an Ish Milchamah; Hashem shmo.
Shemot,15,4,Markevot Pharaoh and his army hath He cast into the yam; his select commanders also are drowned in Yam Suf.
Shemot,15,5,The tehomot (depths) have covered them; they sank into the bottom like an even (stone).
Shemot,15,6,"Thy right hand, Hashem , is become glorious in ko'ach; Thy right hand, Hashem , hath dashed into pieces the oyev."
Shemot,15,7,"And in the greatness of Thine majesty Thou hast overthrown them that rose up against Thee; Thou sentest forth Thy charon (wrath) , which consumed them as stubble."
Shemot,15,8,"And with the blast of Thy nostrils the mayim were gathered together, the floods stood upright like a stack, and the tehomot were congealed in the lev yam (heart of the sea)."
Shemot,15,9,"The oyev said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will share the plunder; my battle-lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my cherev, my yad shall take possession of them."
Shemot,15,10,"Thou didst blow with Thy ruach, the yam covered them; they sank like lead in the mighty waters."
Shemot,15,11,"Mi chamochah ba'elim, Adonoi (Who is like unto Thee, Hashem , among the elim)? Who is like Thee, glorious in kodesh (holiness) , awesome in praiseworthy acts, doing wonders?"
Shemot,15,12,"Thou didst stretch out Thy right hand, eretz swallowed them."
Shemot,15,13,Thou in Thy chesed hast led forth the people which Thou hast redeemed (acquired back) ; Thou hast guided them in Thy oz unto Thy neveh kodesh (holy habitation).
Shemot,15,14,"The nations shall hear, and be afraid; anguish shall take hold on the inhabitants of Peleshet (Philistia)."
Shemot,15,15,"Then the chief men of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moav, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Kena'an shall melt away with weakness."
Shemot,15,16,"Terror and pachad shall fall upon them; by the greatness of Thine zero'a they shall be struck dumb as an even (stone) ; till Thy people pass by, Hashem , till the people pass by, which Thou hast purchased."
Shemot,15,17,"Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the har of Thine nachalah, in the place, Hashem , which Thou hast made for Thee to dwell in, in the Mikdash, Adonoi, which Thy hands have established."
Shemot,15,18, Hashem shall reign l'olam va'ed.
Shemot,15,19,"For the sus Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his parash into the yam, and Hashem brought again the waters of the yam upon them; but the Bnei Yisroel went on yabashah (dry land) in the middle of the yam."
Shemot,15,20,"And Miryam the neviah, the achot Aharon, took the tof (hand drum) in her yad; and all the nashim went out after her with hand-drums and with dancing."
Shemot,15,21,"And Miryam sang to them, Sing ye to Hashem , for He hath triumphed gloriously; the sus and its rider hath He thrown into the yam."
Shemot,15,22,"So Moshe brought Yisroel from the Yam Suf, and they went out into the midbar of Shur; and they went shloshet yamim in the midbar, and found no mayim."
Shemot,15,23,"And when they came to Marah (Bitter Place) , they could not drink of the mayim from Marah, for they were marim; therefore the shem of it was called Marah."
Shemot,15,24,"So the people murmured against Moshe, saying, Mah nishteh (what shall we drink)?"
Shemot,15,25,"And he cried unto Hashem ; and Hashem showed him an etz (tree) which when he had cast into the mayim, the waters were made sweet; at that place He made for them a chok (statute, requirement, obligation) and a mishpat (divine judgment) , and there He tested them,"
Shemot,15,26,"And said, If thou wilt diligently pay heed to the voice of Hashem Eloheicha, and will do that which is yashar in His sight, and will give ear to do His mitzvot, and be shomer over all His chok, I will put none of these machalah (diseases) upon thee, which I put upon the Egyptians; for Ani Adonoi rofecha (I am Hashem that healeth thee)."
Shemot,15,27,"And they came to Elim (Great Trees) . There were twelve springs of mayim, and threescore and ten date-palm trees; and they encamped there by the mayim."
Shemot,16,1,"And they took their journey from Elim, and kol Adat Bnei Yisroel came unto the midbar of Sin (pronounced “Seen”) , which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of Eretz Mitzrayim."
Shemot,16,2,And kol Adat Bnei Yisroel murmured against Moshe and Aharon in the midbar;
Shemot,16,3,"And the Bnei Yisroel said unto them, If only G-d would have made us die by the yad Hashem in Eretz Mitzrayim, when we sat by the sir habasar (pot of meat) , and when we did eat lechem to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this midbar, to kill this kol hakahal with ra'av (hunger)."
Shemot,16,4,"Then said Hashem unto Moshe, Hineni, I will rain lechem from Shomayim upon you; and HaAm shall go out and gather a certain daily provision, that I may test them, whether they will walk in My torah, or no."
Shemot,16,5,"And it shall come to pass, that on the yom hashishi (sixth day) they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily."
Shemot,16,6,"And Moshe and Aharon said unto kol Bnei Yisroel, At erev, then ye shall know that Hashem hath brought you out from Eretz Mitzrayim;"
Shemot,16,7,"And in the boker, then ye shall see the kevod Hashem ; because He heareth your telunnot (murmurings, grumblings) against Hashem ; and who are we, that ye murmur against us?"
Shemot,16,8,"And Moshe said, This shall be, when Hashem shall give you basar in the erev to eat, and in the boker lechem to the full; because Hashem heareth your telunnot which ye murmur against Him; and who are we? Your telunnot are not against us, but against Hashem."
Shemot,16,9,"And Moshe spoke unto Aharon, Say unto kol Adat Bnei Yisroel, Come near before Hashem ; for He hath heard your telunnot."
Shemot,16,10,"And it came to pass, as Aharon spoke unto kol Adat Bnei Yisroel, that they looked toward the midbar, and, hinei, the kevod Hashem appeared in the anan."
Shemot,16,11,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe, saying,"
Shemot,16,12,"I have heard the telunnot Bnei Yisroel; speak unto them, saying, At twilight ye shall eat basar, and in the boker ye shall be glutted with lechem; and ye shall know that I am Hashem Eloheichem."
Shemot,16,13,"And it came to pass, that at erev the quails came up, and covered the machaneh; and in the boker there was a layer of tal (dew) about the machaneh."
Shemot,16,14,"And when the layer of tal evaporated, hinei, upon the surface of the midbar there lay thin flakes, as thin as a layer of kfor (frost) upon ha'aretz."
Shemot,16,15,"And when the Bnei Yisroel saw it, they said one to another, Mahn hu (What is it?) For they knew not mah hu (what [is] this). And Moshe said unto them, This is the lechem which Hashem hath given you to eat."
Shemot,16,16,"This is the thing which Hashem hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating [need], an omer per person, according to the number of your nefashot; take ye every man for them which are in his ohel."
Shemot,16,17,"And the Bnei Yisroel did so, and gathered, some more, some less."
Shemot,16,18,"And when they did measure it by the omer, he that gathered much had nothing extra, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating [need]."
Shemot,16,19,"And Moshe said, Let no ish leave of it until boker."
Shemot,16,20,"Notwithstanding, they paid heed not unto Moshe; but some left part of it until boker, and [the leftovers] bred tola'im (worms) , and stank; and Moshe was angry with them."
Shemot,16,21,"And they gathered it every boker, every man according to his eating [need]; and when the shemesh grew hot, it melted."
Shemot,16,22,"And it came to pass, that on yom hashishi they gathered twice as much lechem, two omers for one man; and all the nesi'im of the Edah came and told Moshe."
Shemot,16,23,"And he said unto them, This is that which Hashem hath said, Tomorrow is a Shabbaton (day of rest) , Shabbos Kodesh unto Hashem ; bake that which ye will bake today, and boil that ye will boil; and that which remaineth over lay up for you for mishmeret (for keeping) until boker."
Shemot,16,24,"And they laid it up, saving it until boker, as Moshe commanded; and it did not stink, neither was there any infestation therein."
Shemot,16,25,"And Moshe said, Eat that today; for today is a Shabbos unto Hashem ; today ye shall not find it in the sadeh."
Shemot,16,26,"Sheshet yamim ye shall gather it; but on the yom hashevi'i, which is Shabbos, in it there shall be none."
Shemot,16,27,"And it came to pass, that there went out some from HaAm on the yom hashevi'i to gather, and they found none."
Shemot,16,28,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, How long refuse ye to be shomer over My mitzvot and My torot?"
Shemot,16,29,"See, that Hashem hath given you the Shabbos, therefore He giveth you on yom hashishi lechem for two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out from his place on yom hashevi'i."
Shemot,16,30,So HaAm rested on yom hashevi'i.
Shemot,16,31,"And Bais Yisroel called the shem thereof Manna; and it was like coriander seed, lavan (white) ; and the taste of it was like flat cakes fried in devash."
Shemot,16,32,"And Moshe said, This is the thing which Hashem commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be mishmeret (kept) for your dorot; that they may see the lechem wherewith I have fed you in the midbar, when I brought you forth from Eretz Mitzrayim."
Shemot,16,33,"And Moshe said unto Aharon, Take a jar, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before Hashem , to be kept for your dorot."
Shemot,16,34,"As Hashem commanded Moshe, so Aharon laid it up before the Edut (the [Ark] of the Testimony), for mishmeret (to be kept)."
Shemot,16,35,"And the Bnei Yisroel did eat manna arba'im shanah, until they came to an eretz noshavet (an inhabited land) ; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of Eretz Kena'an."
Shemot,16,36,Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.
Shemot,17,1,"And kol Adat Bnei Yisroel journeyed from the midbar of Sin, setting out, according to the commandment of Hashem , and encamped in Rephidim; and there was no mayim for HaAm to drink."
Shemot,17,2,"Wherefore the people did chide (quarrel, become dissatisfied with) Moshe, and said, Give us mayim that we may drink. And Moshe said unto them, Why chide ye with me? Why do ye put Hashem to the test?"
Shemot,17,3,"And HaAm thirsted there for mayim; and the people murmured against Moshe, and said, Why is this that thou hast brought us up out of Mitzrayim, to kill me and my banim and my livestock with tzama (thirst)?"
Shemot,17,4,"And Moshe cried unto Hashem , saying, What shall I do with this people? They are almost ready to stone me."
Shemot,17,5,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, Go on ahead of HaAm, and take with thee Ziknei Yisroel; and thy matteh (staff) wherewith thou struck the Nile, take in thine yad, and go."
Shemot,17,6,"Hineni, I will stand before thee there upon the tzur in Chorev; thou shalt strike the tzur, and there shall come mayim out of it, that HaAm may drink. Moshe did so in the sight of the Ziknei Yisroel."
Shemot,17,7,"And he called the shem of the place Massah (Testing) , and Merivah (Dissatisfaction) , because of the riv (chiding, quarreling) of the Bnei Yisroel, and because they put Hashem to the test, saying, Is Hashem among us, or not?"
Shemot,17,8,"Then came Amalek, and did battle against Yisroel in Rephidim."
Shemot,17,9,"And Moshe said unto Yehoshua, Choose for us anashim, and go out, do battle with Amalek; tomorrow I will station myself on the top of the hill with the matteh HaElohim in mine yad."
Shemot,17,10,"So Yehoshua did as Moshe had said to him, and did battle with Amalek; and Moshe, Aharon, and Chur went up to the top of the hill."
Shemot,17,11,"And it came to pass, as long as Moshe held up his yad, that Yisroel prevailed; and when he let down his yad, Amalek prevailed."
Shemot,17,12,"When the hands of Moshe grew heavy, they took an even (stone) , and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aharon and Chur supported his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands held emunah (steady) until bo hashemesh (sunset)."
Shemot,17,13,And Yehoshua disabled Amalek and his army with the edge of the cherev.
Shemot,17,14,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, Write this for a zikaron (memorial, remembering) in a sefer, and rehearse it in the ears of Yehoshua; for I will utterly efface the memory of Amalek from under Shomayim."
Shemot,17,15,"And Moshe built a Mizbe'ach, and called the shem of it Hashem Nissi( Hashem is my Standard);"
Shemot,17,16,"For he said, Because a yad has been against the kes Hashem (throne of Hashem), Hashem hath milchamah against Amalek from dor to dor."
Shemot,18,1,"When Yitro, the kohen of Midyan, Mosheʼs khoten (father-in-law) , heard of all that Elohim had done for Moshe, and for Yisroel His people, and that Hashem had brought Yisroel out of Mitzrayim;"
Shemot,18,2,"Then Yitro, Mosheʼs khoten, received Tzipporah, Mosheʼs wife, after Moshe had sent her away,"
Shemot,18,3,"And her two banim; of which the shem of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been a ger in a foreign land;"
Shemot,18,4,"And the shem of the other was Eli'ezer; for the Elohei Avi, said he, was ezri (my help) , and delivered me from the cherev of Pharaoh;"
Shemot,18,5,"And Yitro, Mosheʼs khoten, came with his banim and his isha unto Moshe into the midbar, where he encamped at the Har HaElohim;"
Shemot,18,6,"And he said unto Moshe, I thy khoten (father-in-law) Yitro am come unto thee, and thy isha, and her two banim with her."
Shemot,18,7,"And Moshe went out to meet his khoten, bowed low, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their shalom (welfare) ; and they came into the ohel."
Shemot,18,8,"And Moshe told his khoten all that Hashem had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for the sake of Yisroel, and all the travail that had befallen them along the derech, and how Hashem saved and delivered them."
Shemot,18,9,"And Yitro rejoiced for all the tovah which Hashem had done for Yisroel, whom He had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians."
Shemot,18,10,"And Yitro said, Baruch Hashem , Who hath rescued you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, and Who hath delivered HaAm from under the hand of the Egyptians."
Shemot,18,11,Now I have da'as that Hashem is gadol than kol haelohim; for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly He was above them.
Shemot,18,12,"And Yitro, Mosheʼs khoten, brought an olah and zevakhim for Elohim; and Aharon came, and kol Ziknei Yisroel, to eat lechem with Mosheʼs khoten before HaElohim."
Shemot,18,13,"And it came to pass on next day, that Moshe sat to judge HaAm; and HaAm stood around Moshe from the boker unto erev."
Shemot,18,14,"And when Mosheʼs khoten saw all that he was doing for HaAm, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? Why sittest thou thyself alone, and kol HaAm stand around thee from boker unto erev?"
Shemot,18,15,"And Moshe said unto his khoten, Because HaAm come unto me to inquire of Elohim;"
Shemot,18,16,"When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the chukkei HaElohim, and His torot."
Shemot,18,17,"And Mosheʼs khoten said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not tov."
Shemot,18,18,"Thou wilt surely wear out, both thou, and HaAm hazeh that is with thee; for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone."
Shemot,18,19,"Shema (pay heed) now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and may Elohim be with thee; be thou for HaAm before HaElohim, that thou mayest bring the disputes unto HaElohim;"
Shemot,18,20,"And thou shalt teach them chukkim and torot, and shalt show them the derech wherein they must walk, and the ma'aseh that they must do."
Shemot,18,21,"Moreover thou shalt provide out of kol HaAm anshei chayil (able men) , yirei Elohim, anshei emes, hating bribes; and place such over them, to be over thousands, and over hundreds, over fifties, and over tens;"
Shemot,18,22,"And let them judge HaAm at all times; and it shall be, that every davar hagadol they shall bring unto thee, but every davar hakaton they shall judge; so shall it be eased for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee."
Shemot,18,23,"If thou shalt do this thing, and Elohim command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and kol HaAm hazeh shall also go to their place in shalom."
Shemot,18,24,"So Moshe paid heed to the voice of his khoten, and did all that he had said."
Shemot,18,25,"And Moshe chose anshei chayil out of kol Yisroel, and made them rashim over HaAm, over thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens."
Shemot,18,26,"And they judged HaAm at all times; the davar hakasheh (difficult case) they brought unto Moshe, but every devar hakaton they judged themselves."
Shemot,18,27,And Moshe let his khoten depart; and he went his way into his own land.
Shemot,19,1,"In the chodesh hashelishi (third new moon) , after the Bnei Yisroel had their exodus from Eretz Mitzrayim, on that very day they came into the Midbar Sinai."
Shemot,19,2,"For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to Midbar Sinai, and had encamped in the midbar; and there Yisroel camped before HaHar."
Shemot,19,3,"And Moshe went up to HaElohim, and Hashem called out unto him from HaHar, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the Bais Ya'akov, and declare unto the Bnei Yisroel;"
Shemot,19,4,"You yourselves have seen what I did unto the Mitzrayim, and how I carried you on eaglesʼ wings, and brought you unto Myself."
Shemot,19,5,"Now therefore, if ye will obey My voice very carefully, and be shomer over My brit, then ye shall be a segullah (treasured possession) unto Me above all people; for kol ha'aretz is Mine;"
Shemot,19,6,"And ye shall be unto Me a mamlechet kohanim, and a goy kadosh. These are the words which thou shalt recount unto the Bnei Yisroel."
Shemot,19,7,"And Moshe came and summoned the Ziknei HaAm, and set authoritatively before their faces all these words just as Hashem commanded him."
Shemot,19,8,"And kol HaAm answered together, and said, All that Hashem hath spoken we will do. And Moshe brought back the words of HaAm unto Hashem."
Shemot,19,9,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, Hinei, I am coming unto thee in a thick cloud, that HaAm may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee l'olam. Then Moshe told the words of HaAm unto Hashem."
Shemot,19,10,"So Hashem said unto Moshe, Go unto HaAm, and set them apart as kodesh today and tomorrow, and let them wash their clothing,"
Shemot,19,11,And be ready by Yom HaShelishi; for Yom HaShelishi Hashem will come down in the sight of kol HaAm upon Mt. Sinai.
Shemot,19,12,"And thou shalt set boundaries unto HaAm all around, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into HaHar, or touch the edge of it; whosoever toucheth HaHar shall be surely put to death;"
Shemot,19,13,"There shall no yad touch him, but he shall surely be stoned, or surely mortally shot; whether it be behemah or ish, it shall not live; when the yovel soundeth long, they shall come up to HaHar."
Shemot,19,14,"So Moshe came down from HaHar unto HaAm, and set apart as kodesh HaAm; and they washed their clothes."
Shemot,19,15,"Then he said to HaAm, Be ready by Sheloshet Yamim; come not into your isha."
Shemot,19,16,"And it came to pass on the Yom HaShelishi when the boker was breaking, that there were thunderings and lightnings, and a heavy cloud upon HaHar, and the blast of the shofar exceeding loud; so that kol HaAm that was in the machaneh trembled with terror."
Shemot,19,17,And Moshe led HaAm forth out of the machaneh to encounter HaElohim; and they stood at the foot of HaHar.
Shemot,19,18,"And Mt. Sinai was altogether smoking, because Hashem descended upon it in eish; and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of the furnace, and kol HaHar shook violently."
Shemot,19,19,"And when the sound of the shofar was moving [closer], and grew louder and louder, Moshe spoke, and HaElohim answered him in thunder."
Shemot,19,20,"And Hashem came down upon Mt. Sinai, onto the top of HaHar; and Hashem summoned Moshe up to the top of HaHar; and Moshe went up."
Shemot,19,21,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, Go down, warn HaAm, lest they push through toward Hashem to gaze, and many of them fall perishing."
Shemot,19,22,"And let the kohanim also, which come near to Hashem , set themselves apart as kodesh, lest Hashem break forth upon them."
Shemot,19,23,"And Moshe said unto Hashem , HaAm cannot come up to Mt. Sinai; for You Yourself charged us, saying, Establish boundaries for HaHar, and set it apart as kodesh."
Shemot,19,24,"And Hashem said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aharon with thee; but let not the kohanim and HaAm push through to come up unto Hashem , lest He break forth upon them."
Shemot,19,25,So Moshe went down unto HaAm and told them.
Shemot,20,1,"Then Elohim spoke all these words, saying,"
Shemot,20,2,"I am Hashem Eloheicha, Who brought thee out of Eretz Mitzrayim, out of the bais avadim (house of slaves)."
Shemot,20,3,Thou shalt have no elohim acherim in My presence.
Shemot,20,4,"Thou shalt not make unto thee any pesel, or any temunah of any thing that is in Shomayim above, or that is in ha'aretz beneath, or that is in the mayim under ha'aretz."
Shemot,20,5,"Thou shalt not tishtacheveh to them, nor serve them; for I Hashem Eloheicha am an El kanna, visiting the avon Avot upon the Banim unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate Me;"
Shemot,20,6,"But showing chesed unto thousands of them that love Me, and are shomer over My mitzvot."
Shemot,20,7,Thou shalt not take the Shem Hashem Eloheicha in vain; for Hashem will not hold him guiltless that taketh Shmo in vain.
Shemot,20,8,"Remember Yom HaShabbos, to keep it kodesh."
Shemot,20,9,"Sheshet yamim shalt thou labor, and do all thy work:"
Shemot,20,10,"But the Yom HaShevi'i is the Shabbos of Hashem Eloheicha; in it thou shalt not do any melachah, thou, nor thy ben, nor thy bat, thy eved, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy ger that is within thy gates;"
Shemot,20,11,"For in sheshet yamim Hashem made Shomayim and Ha'Aretz, the yam, and all that in them is, and rested Yom HaShevi'i; for this reason Hashem blessed Yom HaShabbos, and set it apart as kodesh."
Shemot,20,12,Honor thy av and thy em; that thy yamim may be long upon ha'adamah which Hashem Eloheicha giveth thee.
Shemot,20,13,Thou shalt not murder.
Shemot,20,14,Thou shalt not commit adultery.
Shemot,20,15,Thou shalt not steal.
Shemot,20,16,Thou shalt not bear ed sheker against thy neighbor.
Shemot,20,17,"Thou shalt not covet thy neighborʼs bais, thou shalt not covet thy neighborʼs isha, nor his eved, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that is thy neighborʼs."
Shemot,20,18,"And kol HaAm saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the sound of the shofar, and HaHar smoking; and when HaAm saw it, they drew back, and stood afar off."
Shemot,20,19,"And they said unto Moshe, Thou speak with us, and we will hear; but let not Elohim speak with us, lest we die."
Shemot,20,20,"And Moshe said unto HaAm, Fear not: for HaElohim is come to test you, and that His fear may be upon your faces, that ye sin not."
Shemot,20,21,"And HaAm stood afar off, while Moshe drew near unto the thick cloud where HaElohim was."
Shemot,20,22,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, Thus thou shalt say unto the Bnei Yisroel, You yourselves have seen that from Shomayim I have spoken with you."
Shemot,20,23,"Ye shall not make beside Me elohei kesef, neither shall ye make for yourselves elohei zahav."
Shemot,20,24,"Mizbe'ach adamah thou shalt make unto Me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy olot, and thy shelamim, thy tzon, and thine oxen; in all places where I cause My Shem to be remembered, I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee."
Shemot,20,25,"And if thou wilt make Me a Mizbe'ach avanim, thou shalt not build it of cut stone; for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast rendered it polluted."
Shemot,20,26,"Neither shalt thou go up by stairs unto Mine Mizbe'ach, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon."
Shemot,21,1,Now these are the mishpatim which thou shalt set before them.
Shemot,21,2,"If thou acquire an eved Ivri, shesh shanim he shall serve; and in the seventh he shall go out lachafeshi (to the freedom) for no charge."
Shemot,21,3,"If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself; if he were a ba'al isha, then his isha shall go out with him."
Shemot,21,4,"If his adon have given him an isha, and to him she gives birth to banim or banot; the isha and her yeledim shall be her adonʼs, and he shall go out [free] by himself."
Shemot,21,5,"And if the eved shall plainly say, I love adoni, my isha, and my banim; I will not go out lachafeshi (to the freedom);"
Shemot,21,6,"Then his adon shall bring him unto HaElohim; he shall also bring him to the delet (door) , or unto the mezuzah; and his adon shall pierce through his ozen (ear) with a piercing-tool; then he shall serve him l'olam."
Shemot,21,7,"And if an ish sell his bat to be an amah (maidservant) , she shall not go out as the avadim [go free]."
Shemot,21,8,"If she please not her adon, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed [go free]; to sell her unto an am nochri (foreign people) he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her."
Shemot,21,9,"And if he have betrothed her unto his ben, he shall deal with her according to the mishpat habanot (rights of [free] daughters)."
Shemot,21,10,"If he take him another, her food, her covering of clothing, and her onah (conjugal rights) shall he not deprive."
Shemot,21,11,"And if he does not perform these three unto her, then shall she go out free without kesef."
Shemot,21,12,"He that strikes down an ish, so that the ish die, shall be surely put to death."
Shemot,21,13,"And if he lie not in ambush, but HaElohim deliver him into his yad, then I will appoint thee a makom where he shall flee there."
Shemot,21,14,"But if an ish come premeditatedly upon his re'a, to murder him by guile; thou shalt take him from Mine Mizbe'ach for capital punishment."
Shemot,21,15,"And he that striketh down his av, or his em, shall be surely put to death."
Shemot,21,16,"And he that kidnaps an ish, and selleth him, or if he be found in his power, the kidnapper shall surely be put to death."
Shemot,21,17,"And he that curseth his av, or his em, shall surely be put to death."
Shemot,21,18,"And if anashim quarrel, and one strike another with an even (stone) , or with his egrof (fist) , and he die not, but is bedfast;"
Shemot,21,19,"If he rise again, and walk around outside upon his staff, then shall he that struck down him be absolved; only shivto yiten (he shall give for his lost time) , and shall provide for him to be thoroughly healed."
Shemot,21,20,"And if an ish strikes his eved, or his amah, with a shevet (rod) , and he die under his yad; he shall be surely avenged."
Shemot,21,21,"Notwithstanding, if he continue a yom or two, he shall not be avenged; for he is his kesef."
Shemot,21,22,"If men fight, and hurt an isha harah (pregnant woman) , so that she gives birth prematurely but not with any injury; he shall be surely punished, according as the ba'al haisha will assess a fine upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine."
Shemot,21,23,"And if any ason (harm, fatality) follow, then thou shalt take nefesh for nefesh,"
Shemot,21,24,"Ayin for ayin, shen for shen, yad for yad, regel for regel,"
Shemot,21,25,"Burn for burn, wound for wound, chaburah (stripe laceration) for chaburah."
Shemot,21,26,"And if an ish strike the ayin of his eved, or the ayin of his amah, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his ayinʼs sake."
Shemot,21,27,"And if he strike his evedʼs shen (tooth) , or his amahʼs shen; he shall let him go free for his shenʼs sake."
Shemot,21,28,"If an ox gore an ish or an isha, that they die; then the ox shall be surely stoned, and his basar shall not be eaten; but the ba'al hashor (owner of the ox) shall be exempt from punishment."
Shemot,21,29,"But if the shor habitually from mitmol (yesterday) gored, and its ba'al has been warned, and he hath not kept it in the bull pen, and it hath killed an ish or an isha; the shor shall be stoned, and his ba'al also shall be put to death."
Shemot,21,30,"If there be laid on him a kofer (atonement payment, ransom) , then he shall give for the redemption of his nefesh whatsoever is assessed upon him."
Shemot,21,31,"Whether he have gored a ben, or have gored a bat, according to this mishpat shall it be done unto him."
Shemot,21,32,"If the ox shall gore an eved or an amah; he shall give unto their adon sheloshim shekalim kesef, and the ox shall be stoned."
Shemot,21,33,"And if an ish shall open a bor (pit) , or if an ish shall dig a bor and not cover it, and an ox or a donkey fall therein;"
Shemot,21,34,"The ba'al habor shall make restitution, and give kesef unto their ba'alim; and the carcass shall be his."
Shemot,21,35,"And if the shor ish (ox of a man) hurt the ox of a neighbor, that it die; then they shall sell the shor hachai (live ox) , and divide the kesef of it; and the carcass also they shall divide."
Shemot,21,36,"Or if it be known that the shor hath habitually from mitmol (yesterday) gored, and his ba'al hath not kept it in the bull pen; he shall surely pay ox for ox; and the carcass shall belong to him."
Shemot,22,1,"If a ganav takes a shor, or a seh, and slaughter it, or sell it; he shall restore five cattle for an ox, and the seh."
Shemot,22,2,"If a ganav be caught breaking in, and be struck down so that he die, there shall be no guilt of bloodshed for him."
Shemot,22,3,"If the shemesh be risen upon him, there shall be guilt of bloodshed; the ganav should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then the ganav shall be sold to make restitution for his theft."
Shemot,22,4,"If the theft be certainly found in his yad chayyim, whether it be ox, or donkey, or seh; he shall pay back double."
Shemot,22,5,"If a man shall allow livestock to graze over a sadeh or kerem (vineyard) , or he lets it loose and it graze over the sadeh of another, then from the best of his own sadeh, and of the best of his own kerem (vineyard) , shall he make restitution."
Shemot,22,6,"If eish break out, and spreads in kotzim (thorns) , so that the stacks of grain, or the standing grain, or the sadeh, be consumed therewith; he that kindled the eish shall surely make restitution."
Shemot,22,7,"If an ish shall give unto his re'a kesef or vessels to be shomer over, and it be stolen out of the bais haish; if the ganav be found, let him pay back double."
Shemot,22,8,"If the ganav be not found, then the ba'al habais shall be brought before HaElohim, to see whether he has put his yad on the property of his neighbor."
Shemot,22,9,"For all manner of pesha (trespass, liability) , whether it be for ox, for donkey, for seh, for clothing, or for any manner of avedah (lost property, missing thing) which another says, This is it, the case of both shall come before HaElohim; and whom Elohim shall condemn, he shall pay back double unto his re'a."
Shemot,22,10,"If an ish deliver unto his re'a a donkey, or an ox, or a seh, or any behemah, to be shomer over; and it die, or be injured, or carried away, with no eye witness;"
Shemot,22,11,"Then shall a shevuat Hashem be between them both, that he hath not laid his yad on the property of his re'a; and the propertyʼs ba'al shall accept thereof, and he shall not make restitution."
Shemot,22,12,"And if it be certainly stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the ba'al thereof."
Shemot,22,13,"If it be indeed tarof (torn by a wild animal, predator) , then let him bring it for ed (witness) , and he shall not make restitution for the terefah (torn animal)."
Shemot,22,14,"And if an ish asks to borrow of his re'a, and the animal borrowed be injured, or die, the ba'al thereof being not with it, he shall surely make restitution."
Shemot,22,15,"But if the ba'al thereof be with it, he shall not make restitution; if it be sakhir (rented, hired) , it came for its hire."
Shemot,22,16,"And if an ish entice a betulah that is not orasah (betrothed, pledged) , and lie with her, he shall surely endow her with a marriage contract as his isha."
Shemot,22,17,"If her av utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay kesef according to the mohar habetulot (marriage contract, dowry of the virgins)."
Shemot,22,18,"Thou shalt not allow a mekhashefah (witch, sorceress) to live."
Shemot,22,19,Kol shochev (every one having sexual relations) with a behemah shall surely be put to death.
Shemot,22,20,"He that sacrificeth unto elohim (the g-ds) , other than unto Hashem only, he shall be destroyed."
Shemot,22,21,"Thou shalt neither mistreat a ger, nor oppress him; for ye were gerim in Eretz Mitzrayim."
Shemot,22,22,"Ye shall not cause pain to any almanah, or yatom."
Shemot,22,23,"If thou cause them pain in any way, and they cry at all unto Me, I will surely hear their cry;"
Shemot,22,24,"And My wrath shall be kindled, and I will kill you with the cherev; and your nashim shall be almanot, and your banim shall be yetomim."
Shemot,22,25,"If thou lend kesef to any of My people that is poor among thee, thou shalt not be to him as a nosheh (a usurer) , neither shalt thou lay upon him neshekh (usury, interest)."
Shemot,22,26,"If thou at all take the cloak of thy re'a as security, thou shalt return it unto him by bo hashemesh (sunset);"
Shemot,22,27,"For that is his covering only, it is his cloak for his skin; wherein shall he sleep? And it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto Me, that I will hear; for I am channun (compassionate)."
Shemot,22,28,"Thou shalt not revile Elohim, nor curse the nasi of thy people."
Shemot,22,29,Thou shalt not delay to offer thy fullness offering or thy kohenʼs heave offering; the bechor of thy banim shalt thou present unto Me.
Shemot,22,30,"Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy tzon; shivat yamim it shall be with its em; on the yom hashemi'ni thou shalt give it Me."
Shemot,22,31,And ye shall be anshei kodesh unto Me; neither shall ye eat any basar that is terefah (torn of beasts) in the sadeh; ye shall cast it to the kelev (dog).
Shemot,23,1,Thou shalt not spread a false report; put not thine hand with the rashah to be an ed chamas (malicious witness).
Shemot,23,2,"Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou speak in a riv (cause, lawsuit) to turn aside after many to pervert justice;"
Shemot,23,3,"Neither shalt thou favor a poor man in his riv (cause, lawsuit)."
Shemot,23,4,"If thou meet thine enemyʼs shor (ox) or his chamor (donkey) going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again."
Shemot,23,5,"If thou see the chamor of him that hateth thee lying under his massa, and wouldest refrain from helping him, thou shalt surely help with him."
Shemot,23,6,"Thou shalt not pervert the mishpat of thy poor in his riv (cause, lawsuit)."
Shemot,23,7,Keep thee far from a devar sheker (false matter) ; and the naki (innocent) and tzaddik slay thou not; for I will not acquit the rashah.
Shemot,23,8,"And thou shalt take no shochad (bribe, gift) ; for the shochad blindeth the seeing, and perverteth the words of the tzaddikim."
Shemot,23,9,"Also thou shalt not oppress a ger; for ye know the nefesh of a ger, seeing ye were gerim in Eretz Mitzrayim."
Shemot,23,10,"And shesh shanim thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the crops thereof;"
Shemot,23,11,"But the shevi'it thou shalt leave it shamat (unplowed) and let it lie fallow; that the evyon (poor) of thy people may eat; and what they leave the beasts of the sadeh shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy kerem (vineyard) , and with thy zayit (olive) grove."
Shemot,23,12,"Sheshet yamim thou shalt do thy work, and on the yom hashevi'i thou shalt rest; that thine shor (ox) and thine chamor (donkey) may rest, and the ben of thy amah (handmaid) , and the ger, may be refreshed."
Shemot,23,13,"And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect; and make no mention of the shem elohim acherim, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth."
Shemot,23,14,Three times thou shalt keep a Chag unto Me in the shanah.
Shemot,23,15,"Thou shalt be shomer to keep the Chag HaMatzot; thou shalt eat matzot shivah yamim, as I commanded thee, in the time appointed of the month Aviv; for in it thou camest out from Mitzrayim; and none shall appear before Me empty-handed;"
Shemot,23,16,"And the Chag HaKatzir, Bikkurim (Firstfruits) of thy labors, which thou hast sown in the sadeh; and the Chag HaAsif (Feast of Ingathering), which is in the end of the shanah, when thou hast gathered in thy labors out of the sadeh."
Shemot,23,17,Shalosh pe'amim in the shanah all thy zachar shall appear before HaAdon Hashem.
Shemot,23,18,Thou shalt not offer the dahm of My zevach with chametz; neither shall the chelev of My sacrifice remain until the boker.
Shemot,23,19,The reshit bikkurim of thy land thou shalt bring into the Bais Hashem Eloheicha. Thou shalt not cook a kid in his motherʼs cholov.
Shemot,23,20,"Hinei, I send Malach before thee, to be shomer over thee in the derech, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared."
Shemot,23,21,"Pay heed to him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your peysha'im; for My Shem is in him."
Shemot,23,22,"But if thou shalt indeed obey his [bat] kol, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries."
Shemot,23,23,"For My Malach shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Emori, and the Chitti, and the Perizzi, and the Kena'ani, the Chivi, and the Yevusi; I will cut them off."
Shemot,23,24,"Thou shalt not bow down to their elohim, nor serve them, nor follow after their works; but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and completely break down their matztzvot (memorial columns dedicated to idols)."
Shemot,23,25,"And ye shall serve Hashem Eloheichem, and He shall bless thy lechem, and thy mayim; and I will take machalah (sickness) away from the midst of thee."
Shemot,23,26,"There shall nothing miscarry their young, nor be barren, in thy land; the mispar (number) of thy yamim I will fulfill."
Shemot,23,27,"I will send My ehmah (terror) ahead of thee, and will throw into confusion all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee."
Shemot,23,28,"And I will send the tzirah (hornet) ahead of thee, which shall drive out the Chivi, the Kena'ani, and the Chitti, from before thee."
Shemot,23,29,"I will not drive them out from before thee in shanah echat; lest ha'aretz become desolate, and the beast of the sadeh multiply against thee."
Shemot,23,30,"Me'at me'at (little by little) I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit ha'aretz."
Shemot,23,31,"And I will establish thy borders from the Yam Suf even unto the Yam Pelishtim, and from the Midbar unto the [Euphrates] River: for I will deliver the inhabitants of ha'aretz into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee."
Shemot,23,32,"Thou shalt make no brit (covenant) with them, nor with their elohim."
Shemot,23,33,"They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against Me; for if thou serve their elohim, it will surely be a mokesh (snare) unto thee."
Shemot,24,1,"And He said unto Moshe, Come up unto Hashem , thou, and Aharon, Nadav, and Avihu, and shive'im (seventy) of the Ziknei Yisroel; and worship ye afar off."
Shemot,24,2,And Moshe alone shall come near Hashem ; but they shall not come near; neither shall HaAm go up with him.
Shemot,24,3,"And Moshe came and told HaAm kol divrei Hashem , and all the mishpatim; and kol HaAm answered with one voice, and said, All the words which Hashem hath said will we do."
Shemot,24,4,"And Moshe wrote kol divrei Hashem , and rose up early in the boker, and built a Mizbe'ach at the base of HaHar, and twelve matzevah (stone pillars) , according to the twelve Shivtei Yisroel."
Shemot,24,5,"And he sent out na'arei Bnei Yisroel, which offered olot (burnt offerings) , and sacrificed shelamim (peace offerings) of bulls unto Hashem."
Shemot,24,6,"And Moshe took half of the dahm, and put it in bowls; and the other half of the dahm he sprinkled upon the Mizbe'ach."
Shemot,24,7,"Then he took the Sefer HaBrit, and read it aloud in the ears of HaAm, and they responded, All that Hashem hath said we will do, and be obedient."
Shemot,24,8,"And Moshe took the remaining dahm, and sprinkled it on HaAm, and said, Hinei dahm habrit, which Hashem hath cut with you concerning all these words."
Shemot,24,9,"Then went up Moshe, and Aharon, Nadav, and Avihu, and shive'im Ziknei Yisroel;"
Shemot,24,10,"And they saw the Elohei Yisroel; and there was under His feet the likeness of sapphire stone pavement, and like the very Shomayim in its clearness."

Shemot,29,20,"Then shalt thou slaughter (shachat) the ayil, and take of his dahm, and put it upon the lobe of the right ear of Aharon, and upon the lobe of the right ear of his banim, and upon the thumb of their right yad, and upon the bohen of their right foot, and sprinkle the dahm upon the Mizbe'ach, all around."
Shemot,29,21,"And thou shalt take of the dahm that is upon the Mizbe'ach, and of the shemen hamishchah, and sprinkle it upon Aharon, upon his garments, upon his banim, upon the garments of his banim with him; he shall be set apart as kodesh, and his garments, his banim, his banimʼs garments with him."
Shemot,29,22,"Also thou shalt take of the ram the chelev and the tail, and the fat that covereth the innards, and the diaphragm with the liver, and the two kidneys, and the chelev that is on them, and the right thigh; for it is an ayil millu'im (ram of ordination);"
Shemot,29,23,"And one kekar lechem (loaf of bread) , and one challah of lechem shemen (oily loaf of bread) , and one wafer out of the basket of the matzot that is before Hashem;"
Shemot,29,24,"And thou shalt put all in the hands of Aharon, and in the hands of his banim; and shalt wave them for a tenufah before Hashem."
Shemot,29,25,"And thou shalt take them from their hands, and burn them upon the Mizbe'ach for an olah, for a re'ach hannichoach before Hashem : it is an offering made by eish unto Hashem."
Shemot,29,26,"And thou shalt take the breast of the ayil hamillu'im (ram of ordination) for Aharon, and wave it for a tenufah before Hashem ; and it shall be thy portion."
Shemot,29,27,"And thou shalt set apart as kodesh the breast of the tenufah, and the thigh of the terumah, which is waved, and which is raised up, of the ayil hamillu'im, even of that which is for Aharon, and of that which is for his banim;"
Shemot,29,28,"And it shall be Aharonʼs and his banimʼs by a chok olam from the Bnei Yisroel; for it is a terumah; and it shall be a terumah from the Bnei Yisroel of the zivkhei shelemim of them, even their terumah unto Hashem."
Shemot,29,29,"And the Bigdei Hakodesh of Aharon shall be his banimʼs after him, to be anointed therein, and to be ordained in them."
Shemot,29,30,"And that ben that is kohen in his succession shall put them on shivat yamim, when he cometh into the Ohel Mo'ed to minister in HaKodesh."
Shemot,29,31,"And thou shalt take the ayil hamillu'im, and cook his basar in the Makom Kodesh."
Shemot,29,32,"And Aharon and his banim shall eat the basar of the ayil, and the lechem that is in the sal petach Ohel Mo'ed."
Shemot,29,33,"And they shall eat those things wherewith the kapporah was made, to ordain and to set them apart as kodesh; but a zar shall not eat thereof, because they are kodesh."
Shemot,29,34,"And if anything remains of the basar of the millu'im, or of the lechem, unto the boker, then thou shalt burn the remainder with eish; it shall not be eaten, because it is kodesh."
Shemot,29,35,"And thus shalt thou do unto Aharon, and to his banim, according to all things which I have commanded thee; shivat yamim shalt thou ordain them."
Shemot,29,36,"And thou shalt offer every day the bull of the chattat for kippurim (blood atonements) ; and thou shalt purify the Mizbe'ach, when thou hast made a kapporah for it, and thou shalt anoint it, to set it apart as kodesh."
Shemot,29,37,"Shivat yamim thou shalt make a kapporah for the Mizbe'ach, and set it apart as kodesh; and it shall be a Mizbe'ach kodesh kodashim; whatsoever toucheth the Mizbe'ach shall be kodesh."
Shemot,29,38,Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the Mizbe'ach: two kevasim (lambs) of the first year each day tamid (continually).
Shemot,29,39,The one lamb thou shalt offer in the boker; and the other lamb thou shalt offer in the afternoon;
Shemot,29,40,And with the one lamb a tenth ephah of fine flour mixed with the fourth part of a hin of pressed shemen; and the fourth part of a hin of yayin for a nesekh (drink offering).
Shemot,29,41,"And the other lamb thou shalt offer in the afternoon, and shalt do thereto according to the minchah of the boker, and according to the nesekh thereof, for a re'ach hannichoach, an offering made by eish unto Hashem."
Shemot,29,42,"This shall be an olat tamid throughout your dorot at the petach of the Ohel Mo'ed before Hashem ; where I will meet you, to speak there unto thee."
Shemot,29,43,"And there I will meet by appointment with the Bnei Yisroel, and it shall be set apart as kodesh by My Kavod."
Shemot,29,44,"And I will set apart as kodesh the Ohel Mo'ed, and the Mizbe'ach; and I will set apart as kodesh also both Aharon and his banim, to minister to Me in the kohenʼs office."
Shemot,29,45,"And I will dwell among the Bnei Yisroel, and will be their Elohim."
Shemot,29,46,"And they shall have da'as that I am Hashem Eloheihem, Who brought them forth out of Eretz Mitzrayim, to rest My dwelling among them; I am Hashem Eloheihem."
Shemot,30,1,And thou shalt make a Mizbe'ach to burn ketonet (incense) upon; of acacia wood shalt thou make it.
Shemot,30,2,"A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the width thereof; ravu'a (foursquare, square) shall it be; and two cubits shall be the height thereof; the karnenot thereof shall be of the same."
Shemot,30,3,"And thou shalt overlay it with zahav tahor, the top thereof, and the sides thereof all around, and the karnenot thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of zahav all around."
Shemot,30,4,"And two tabe'ot zahav (golden rings) shalt thou make to it under the crown of it, by the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make it; and they shall be for places for the carrying poles to bear it withal."
Shemot,30,5,"And thou shalt make the carrying poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with zahav."
Shemot,30,6,"And thou shalt put it in front of the Parochet that is before the Aron HaEdut, before the Kapporet that is over HaEdut, where I will set My meetings with thee."
Shemot,30,7,"And Aharon shall burn thereon spice ketoret every boker; when he cleaneth the nerot (lamps) , he shall burn it."
Shemot,30,8,"And when Aharon lighteth the nerot (lamps) in the afternoon, he shall burn ketoret upon it, ketoret tamid before Hashem throughout your dorot."
Shemot,30,9,"Ye shall offer no ketoret zarah thereon, nor olah, nor minchah; neither shall ye pour nesekh thereon."
Shemot,30,10,And Aharon shall make kapporah upon the karenot of it once in a year with the dahm of the chattat hakippurim; once in the year shall he make kapporah upon it throughout your dorot; it is kodesh kodashim unto Hashem.
Shemot,30,11,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe, saying,"
Shemot,30,12,"When thou takest the census of the Bnei Yisroel after their number, then shall they give every man a kofer nafsho (life price, atoning payment for his nefesh or soul) unto Hashem , when thou numberest them; that there be no negef (plague) among them, when thou numberest them."
Shemot,30,13,"This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are pekudim (numbered, counted) , half a shekel after the shekel of HaKodesh. (A shekel is twenty gerahs.) A half shekel shall be the terumah (offering) unto Hashem."
Shemot,30,14,"Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give a terumah (offering) unto Hashem."
Shemot,30,15,"The oisher (rich man) shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when they give a terumah (offering) unto Hashem , to make kapporah for your nefashot."
Shemot,30,16,"And thou shalt take the kesef hakippurim of the Bnei Yisroel, and shalt appoint it for the Avodat Ohel Mo'ed (Work, Service of the Tent of Appointed Meeting) ; that it may be a zikaron unto the Bnei Yisroel before Hashem , to make kapporah for your nefashot."
Shemot,30,17,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe, saying,"
Shemot,30,18,"Thou shalt also make a Kiyor of nechoshet, and its Stand also of nechoshet, to wash withal; and thou shalt place it between the Ohel Mo'ed and the Mizbe'ach, and thou shalt put mayim therein."
Shemot,30,19,For Aharon and his banim shall wash their hands and their feet thereat;
Shemot,30,20,"When they go into the Ohel Mo'ed, they shall wash with mayim, that they die not; or when they come near to the Mizbe'ach to minister, to present offering made by eish unto Hashem;"
Shemot,30,21,"So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not; and it shall be a chok olam to them, even to him and to his zera throughout their dorot."
Shemot,30,22,"Moreover Hashem spoke unto Moshe, saying,"
Shemot,30,23,"Take thou also unto thee choice spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekel-weights, and of fragrant cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty, and of fragrant cane spice two hundred and fifty,"
Shemot,30,24,"And of cassia five hundred shekel-weights, after the shekel of HaKodesh, and of shemen zayit (oil olive) a hin:"
Shemot,30,25,"And thou shalt make it a shemen mishchat kodesh, an ointment of blended compound, the art of the perfumer; it shall be a shemen mishchat kodesh."
Shemot,30,26,"And thou shalt anoint the Ohel Mo'ed therewith, and the Aron HaEdut,"
Shemot,30,27,"And the Shulchan and all its utensils, the Menorah and its utensils, and the Mizbe'ach HaKetoret,"
Shemot,30,28,"And the Mizbe'ach HaOlah with all its utensils, and the Kiyor and its Stand."
Shemot,30,29,"And thou shalt set them apart as kodesh, that they may be kodesh kodashim; whatsoever toucheth them shall be kodesh."
Shemot,30,30,"And thou shalt anoint Aharon and his banim, and set them apart as kodesh, that they may minister unto Me in the kohenʼs office."
Shemot,30,31,"And thou shalt speak unto the Bnei Yisroel, saying, This shall be a shemen mishchat kodesh unto Me throughout your dorot."
Shemot,30,32,"Upon the basar adam shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make any other like it, after the formulation of it; it is kodesh, and it shall be kodesh unto you."
Shemot,30,33,"Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of it upon a zar, shall even be cut off from his people."
Shemot,30,34,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, Take unto thee spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; these spices with pure frankincense; of each shall there be an equal weight;"
Shemot,30,35,"And thou shalt make it a compound of spice, the art of a perfumer, mixed thoroughly together, tahor and kodesh;"
Shemot,30,36,"And thou shalt beat some of it very small, and place it in front of HaEdut in the Ohel Mo'ed, where I will set a meeting with thee; it shall be unto you kodesh kodashim."
Shemot,30,37,"And as for the ketoret which thou shalt make, ye shall not make to yourselves according to the formulation thereof; it shall be unto thee kodesh for Hashem."
Shemot,30,38,"Whosoever shall make its like, to smell it, shall even be cut off from his people."
Shemot,31,1,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe, saying,"
Shemot,31,2,"See, I have called by shem Betzalel ben Uri, ben Chur, of the tribe of Yehudah;"
Shemot,31,3,"And I have filled him with the Ruach Elohim, in chochmah, and in tevunah, and in da'as, and in kol melachah (all workmanship),"
Shemot,31,4,"To devise machashavot (artistic designs) , to work in zahav, and in kesef, and in nechoshet,"
Shemot,31,5,"And in engraving gemstones, to set them, and in wood-carving, to work in kol melachah (all manner of workmanship)."
Shemot,31,6,"And I, hinei, I have given with him Oholiav ben Achisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the hearts of all chacham lev I have put chochmah, that they may make all that I have commanded thee:"
Shemot,31,7,"The Ohel Mo'ed, and the Aron HaEdut, and the Kapporet that is thereupon, and all the utensils of the Ohel,"
Shemot,31,8,"And the Shulchan and its utensils, and the Menorah Hatehorah with all its utensils, and the Mizbe'ach HaKetoret,"
Shemot,31,9,"And the Mizbe'ach HaOlah with all its utensils, and the Kiyor and its Stand,"
Shemot,31,10,"And the Bigdei Haserad (Knit Garments) , and the Bigdei HaKodesh for Aharon the kohen, and the garments of his banim, to minister in the kohenʼs office,"
Shemot,31,11,"And the Shemen Hamishchah, and Ketoret spices for HaKodesh; according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do."
Shemot,31,12,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe, saying,"
Shemot,31,13,"Speak thou also unto the Bnei Yisroel, saying, Verily My Shabbatot ye shall be shomer over; for it is an ot (sign) between Me and you throughout your dorot; that ye may have da'as that I am Hashem Who doth set thee apart as kodesh."
Shemot,31,14,"Ye shall be shomer Shabbos therefore; for it is kodesh unto you; every one that is chillul Shabbos (desecrates Shabbos) shall surely be put to death; for whosoever doeth any work therein, that nefesh shall be cut off from among his people."
Shemot,31,15,"Sheshet yamim may work be done; but in the Yom HaShevi'i is Shabbos HaShabbaton, kodesh to Hashem ; whosoever doeth any work in the Yom HaShabbos, he shall surely be put to death."
Shemot,31,16,"Wherefore the Bnei Yisroel shall be shomer Shabbos, to observe Shabbos throughout their dorot, for a brit olam."
Shemot,31,17,"It is an ot between Me and the Bnei Yisroel l'olam; for in sheshet yamim Hashem made Shomayim and HaAretz, and on Yom HaShevi'i He rested (shavat, ceased working) , and was refreshed."
Shemot,31,18,"And He gave unto Moshe, when He had made an end of speaking with him upon Mt. Sinai, two Luchot HaEdut (Tablets of the Testimony) , Luchot Even (Tablets of Stone) , written with the Etzba Elohim (Finger of G-d)."
Shemot,32,1,"And when HaAm saw that Moshe delayed to come down from HaHar, HaAm gathered themselves together unto Aharon, and said unto him, Up, make us elohim (g-ds) , which shall go before us; for as for this Moshe, the ish that brought us up out of Eretz Mitzrayim, we know not what is become of him."
Shemot,32,2,"And Aharon said unto them, Take off the rings of zahav in the ears of your nashim, of your banim, and of your banot, and bring them unto me."
Shemot,32,3,"And kol HaAm removed the rings of zahav which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aharon."
Shemot,32,4,"And he received them at their yad, and fashioned it with a cheret, after he had made it an Egel Masekhah (Molten Calf) ; and they said, These be thy elohim, O Yisroel, which brought thee up out of Eretz Mitzrayim."
Shemot,32,5,"And when Aharon saw it, he built a Mizbe'ach before it; and Aharon made proclamation, and said, Tomorrow is a chag (feast) to Hashem."
Shemot,32,6,"And they rose up early the next day, and offered olot, and brought shelamim; and HaAm sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up letzachek (to revel)."
Shemot,32,7,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of Eretz Mitzrayim, have corrupted themselves;"
Shemot,32,8,"They have turned aside quickly from HaDerech which I commanded them; they have made them an Egel Masekhah, and have bowed down to it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy elohim, O Yisroel, which have brought thee up out of the Eretz Mitzrayim."
Shemot,32,9,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, I have seen this people, and, hinei, it is an Am Kesheh Oref (stiffnecked, obstinate people);"
Shemot,32,10,"Now therefore let Me alone, that My wrath may burn hot against them, and that I may consume them; I will make of thee a Goy Gadol."
Shemot,32,11,"And Moshe besought Hashem Elohav, and said, Hashem , why doth Thy wrath burn hot against Thy people, which Thou hast brought forth out of Eretz Mitzrayim with ko'ach gadol, and with a yad chazakah?"
Shemot,32,12,"Why should the Egyptians speak, and say, For ra'ah (evil intent) did He bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of ha'adamah? Turn from Thy fierce wrath, and relent of the ra'ah against Thy people."
Shemot,32,13,"Remember Avraham, Yitzchak, and Yisroel, Thy avadim, to whom Thou swore by Thine own Self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your zera as the kokhavim of Shomayim, and kol haaretz hazot that I have spoken of will I give unto your zera, and they shall inherit it l'olam."
Shemot,32,14,And Hashem relented of the ra'ah which He thought to do unto His people.
Shemot,32,15,"And Moshe turned, and went down from HaHar, and the two Luchot HaEdut were in his yad; the Luchot were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written."
Shemot,32,16,"And the Luchot were the ma'aseh Elohim, the writing was the Mikhtav Elohim, engraved upon the Luchot."
Shemot,32,17,"And when Yehoshua heard the kol HaAm as they shouted, he said unto Moshe, There is a noise of milchamah in the machaneh."
Shemot,32,18,"And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for gevurah, neither is it the voice of them that cry of chalushah; but the noise of them that sing that I hear."
Shemot,32,19,"And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the machaneh, that he saw the Egel, and the mecholot (dancing) ; and the anger of Moshe burned hot, and he threw the Luchot out of his hands, and broke them at the foot of HaHar."
Shemot,32,20,"And he took the Egel which they had made, and burned it in the eish, and ground it to powder, and scattered it upon the mayim, and made the Bnei Yisroel drink of it."
Shemot,32,21,"And Moshe said unto Aharon, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so chata'ah gedolah upon them?"
Shemot,32,22,"And Aharon said, Let not the anger of adoni burn hot; thou knowest HaAm, that they are prone to rah (evil)."
Shemot,32,23,"For they said unto me, Make for us elohim, which shall go before us; for as for this Moshe, the ish that brought us up out of Eretz Mitzrayim, we know not what is become of him."
Shemot,32,24,"And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any zahav, let them remove it. So they gave it me; then I cast it into the eish, and there came out this Egel."
Shemot,32,25,And when Moshe saw that HaAm were exposed; (for Aharon had exposed them to derision among their enemies;)
Shemot,32,26,"Then Moshe stood in the sha'ar of the machaneh, and said, Who is on Hashem ʼs side? Let him rally unto me. And all the Bnei Levi gathered themselves together unto him."
Shemot,32,27,"And he said unto them, Thus saith Hashem Elohei Yisroel, Put every man his cherev by his side, and go in and out from sha'ar to sha'ar throughout the machaneh, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor."
Shemot,32,28,And the Bnei Levi did according to the word of Moshe; and there fell of HaAm that day about three thousand men.
Shemot,32,29,"For Moshe had said, Consecrate yourselves today to Hashem , even every man against his ben, and against his brother; that He may bestow upon you a brocha this day."
Shemot,32,30,"And it came to pass on the next day, that Moshe said unto HaAm, Ye have sinned a chata'ah gedolah; and now I will go up unto Hashem ; perhaps I can make kapporah for your chattat."
Shemot,32,31,"And Moshe returned unto Hashem , and said, Oh, this people have sinned a chata'ah gedolah, and have made for themselves elohei zahav."
Shemot,32,32,"Yet now, if Thou wilt forgive their chattat but if not, blot me, now, out of Thy Sefer which Thou hast written."
Shemot,32,33,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, Whosoever hath sinned against Me, him will I blot out of My Sefer."
Shemot,32,34,"Therefore now go, lead HaAm unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee; hinei, Malachi shall go before thee; nevertheless in the yom when I visit I will visit their sin upon them."
Shemot,32,35,"And Hashem plagued HaAm, because they made the Egel, which Aharon made."
Shemot,33,1,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, Depart, and go from here, thou and HaAm which thou hast brought up out of Eretz Mitzrayim, unto HaAretz which I swore unto Avraham, to Yitzchak, and to Ya'akov, saying, Unto thy zera will I give it;"
Shemot,33,2,"And I will send a Malach before thee; and I will drive out the Kena'ani, the Emori, the Chitti, the Perizzi, the Chivi, and the Yevusi;"
Shemot,33,3,"Unto an Eretz zavat cholov and devash; for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou art an Am Kesheh Oref (stiffnecked, obstinate people) ; lest I consume thee in HaDerech."
Shemot,33,4,"And when HaAm heard these evil tidings, they mourned; and no ish did put on him his ornamental attire."
Shemot,33,5,"For Hashem had said unto Moshe, Say unto the Bnei Yisroel, Ye are an Am Kesheh Oref; I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee; therefore now put off thy ornamental attire from thee, that I may decide what to do unto thee."
Shemot,33,6,And the Bnei Yisroel stripped themselves of their ornamental attire by Mt. Chorev.
Shemot,33,7,"And Moshe would take the Ohel, and pitch it outside the machaneh, afar off from the machaneh, and called it the Ohel Mo'ed. And it came to pass, that every one which sought Hashem went out unto the Ohel Mo'ed, which was outside the machaneh."
Shemot,33,8,"And it came to pass, when Moshe went out unto the Ohel, that kol HaAm rose up, and stood every man at his petach ohel, and watched after Moshe, until he was gone into the Ohel."
Shemot,33,9,"And it came to pass, as Moshe entered into the Ohel, the Ammud of the Anan descended, and stood at the petach Ohel, and Hashem would speak with Moshe."
Shemot,33,10,"And kol HaAm saw the Ammud of the Anan stand at the petach Ohel; and kol HaAm rose up and worshiped, every man in his petach ohel."
Shemot,33,11,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe face to face, as an ish speaketh unto his re'a. And he returned into the machaneh; but his mesharet Yehoshua ben Nun, a na'ar, departed not out of the Ohel."
Shemot,33,12,"And Moshe said unto Hashem , See, Thou sayest unto me, Bring this people onward; and Thou hast not let me know whom Thou wilt send with me. Yet Thou hast said, I know thee by shem, and thou hast also found chen (grace, unmerited favor) in My sight."
Shemot,33,13,"Therefore, now, if I have found chen in Thy sight, show me now Thy Derech, that I may have da'as of Thee, that I may find chen in Thy sight; and consider that this nation is Thy people."
Shemot,33,14,"And He said, My Presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest."
Shemot,33,15,"And he said unto Him, If Thy Presence go not with me, bring us not up from here."
Shemot,33,16,"For how then shall it be known that I and Thy people have found chen in Thy sight? Is it not in that Thou goest with us? So shall we be made distinct as separate, I and Thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of ha'adamah."
Shemot,33,17,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken; for thou hast found chen in My sight, and I know thee by shem."
Shemot,33,18,"And he said, show me now Thy kavod."
Shemot,33,19,"And He said, I will make kol tuvi (all My goodness) pass in front of thee, and I will call out with the Shem of Hashem before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show rachamim on whom I will show rachamim."
Shemot,33,20,"And He said, Thou canst not see My face; for there shall no adam see Me, and live."
Shemot,33,21,"And Hashem said, Hinei, there is a place near Me, and thou shalt stand upon the tzur;"
Shemot,33,22,"And it shall come to pass, while My kavod passeth by, that I will put thee in a cleft of the tzur, and will cover thee with My yad until I pass by;"
Shemot,33,23,"And I will take away Mine yad, and thou shalt see My back; but My face shall not be seen."
Shemot,34,1,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, Chisel thee two Luchot Avanim like the first ones; and I will write upon these Luchot the devarim that were on the Luchot HaRishonim, which thou broke."
Shemot,34,2,"And be ready in the boker, and come up in the boker unto Mt.Sinai, and present thyself there to Me on the rosh HaHar."
Shemot,34,3,"And no ish shall come up with thee, neither let any ish be seen throughout kol HaHar; neither let the tzon nor herd graze in front of that Har."
Shemot,34,4,"And he chiseled two Luchot Avanim like the first ones; and Moshe rose up early in the boker, and went up unto Mt.Sinai, as Hashem had commanded him, and took in his yad the two Luchot Avanim."
Shemot,34,5,"And Hashem descended in the anan, and stood with him there, and called out the Shem of Hashem."
Shemot,34,6,"And Hashem passed by before him, and proclaimed, Hashem, Hashem El Rachum v'Channun, slow to anger, and abundant in chesed and emes,"
Shemot,34,7,"Preserving chesed for thousands, forgiving avon and pesha and chatta'ah, and by no means leaving the guilty unpunished; visiting the avon of the avot upon the banim, and upon the bnei banim, unto the third and to the fourth generation."
Shemot,34,8,"And Moshe made haste, and bowed his head toward the ground, and worshiped."
Shemot,34,9,"And he said, If now I have found chen in Thy sight, Adonoi, let Adonoi, now, go among us; although it is an Am Kesheh Oref; and forgive avoneinu and chattateinu, and take us for Thine nachalah."
Shemot,34,10,"And He said, Hinei, I cut a brit; before all thy people I will do nifla'ot, such as have not been done in kol ha'aretz, nor in kol HaGoyim; and kol HaAm among which thou art shall see the ma'aseh Hashem ; for it is a norah that I will do with thee."
Shemot,34,11,"Be thou shomer over that which I command thee this day; hinei, I drive out before thee the Emori, and the Kena'ani, and the Chitti, and the Perizzi, and the Chivi, and the Yevusi."
Shemot,34,12,"Be shomer over thyself, lest thou make a brit with the inhabitants of HaAretz whither thou goest, lest it be for a mokesh (snare) in the midst of thee;"
Shemot,34,13,"But ye shall destroy their mizbechot, break their matzebot, and cut down their asherah (sacred trees, poles);"
Shemot,34,14,"For thou shalt worship no el acher; for Hashem , Whose Shem is Jealous, is El Kanah;"
Shemot,34,15,"Lest thou make a brit with the inhabitants of HaAretz, and they go a-whoring after eloheihem, and do sacrifice unto eloheihem, and one invite thee, and thou eat of his zevach (sacrifice, i.e., participate in his pagan worship);"

Shemot,34,30,"And when Aharon and kol Bnei Yisroel saw Moshe, hinei, the ohr (skin) of his face was radiant; and they were afraid to come near him."
Shemot,34,31,And Moshe called unto them; and Aharon and kol HaNesi'im of the Edah returned unto him; and Moshe spoke with them.
Shemot,34,32,And afterward kol Bnei Yisroel came near; and he gave them in commandment all that Hashem had spoken with him in Mt Sinai.
Shemot,34,33,"When Moshe had finished speaking with them, he put a masveh (veil, mask) on his face."
Shemot,34,34,"But when Moshe went in before Hashem to speak with Him, he took the masveh off, until he came out. And he came out, and spoke unto the Bnei Yisroel that which he was commanded."

Shemot,35,30,"And Moshe said unto the Bnei Yisroel, See, Hashem hath called by shem Betzalel ben Uri, ben Chur, of the tribe of Yehudah;"
Shemot,35,31,"And He hath filled him with the Ruach Elohim, in chochmah, in understanding, and in da'as, and in all manner of workmanship;"

Shemot,36,3,"And they received of Moshe kol haterumah, which the Bnei Yisroel had brought for the work of the Avodas HaKodesh, to make it withal. And they brought yet unto him nedavah every boker."
Shemot,36,4,"And all the chachamim, that wrought all the work of HaKodesh, came every man from his work which they were doing;"
Shemot,36,5,"And they spoke unto Moshe, saying, HaAm bring much more than enough for the Avodah of the work, which Hashem commanded to do."
Shemot,36,6,"And Moshe gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the machaneh, saying, Let neither ish nor isha make any more work for the terumat HaKodesh. So HaAm were restrained from bringing."
Shemot,36,7,For the work had been sufficient for all the work to do it v'hoter.

Shemot,39,31,"And they tied unto it a turquoise cord, to fasten it on the Mitznefet above; as Hashem commanded Moshe."
Shemot,39,32,"Thus was all the work of the Mishkan of the Ohel Mo'ed finished; and the Bnei Yisroel did according to all that Hashem commanded Moshe, so did they."

Shemot,39,43,"And Moshe did inspect all the work, and, hinei, they had done it as Hashem had commanded, even so had they done it; vayevarech otam Moshe (and Moshe blessed them)."
Shemot,40,1,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe, saying,"
Shemot,40,2,On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the Mishkan Ohel Mo'ed.
Shemot,40,3,"And thou shalt place therein the Aron HaEdut, and thou shalt cover so as to screen the Aron with the Parochet."

Shemot,40,9,"And thou shalt take the Shemen HaMishchah, and anoint the Mishkan, and all that is therein, and shalt set it apart as kodesh, and all the utensils thereof; and it shall be kodesh."
Shemot,40,10,"And thou shalt anoint the Mizbe'ach HaOlah, and all its utensils, and set apart as kodesh the Mizbe'ach: and it shall be Mizbe'ach kodesh kodashim."
Shemot,40,11,"And thou shalt anoint the Kiyor and its Stand, and set it apart as kodesh."
Shemot,40,12,"And thou shalt bring near Aharon and his banim unto the Petach Ohel Mo'ed, and immerse them with mayim."
Shemot,40,13,"And thou shalt dress Aharon with the Bigdei Hakodesh, and anoint him, and set him apart as kodesh; that he may minister unto Me in the kohenʼs office."
Shemot,40,14,"And thou shalt bring near his banim, and dress them with kuttanot:"
Shemot,40,15,"And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their av, that they may minister unto Me in the kohenʼs office: for their anointing shall surely be for them a kehunat olam throughout their dorot."
Shemot,40,16,"Thus did Moshe; according to all that Hashem commanded him, so did he."
Shemot,40,17,"And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the Mishkan was erected."

Shemot,40,21,"And he brought the Aron into the Mishkan, and set up the Parochet HaMasach, and shielded with a covering over the Aron HaEdut; as Hashem commanded Moshe."
Shemot,40,22,"And he put the Shulchan in the Ohel Mo'ed, upon the north side of the Mishkan, outside the Parochet."
Shemot,40,23,And he set the Lechem in order upon it before Hashem ; as Hashem had commanded Moshe.
Shemot,40,24,"And he put the Menorah in the Ohel Mo'ed, opposite the Shulchan, on the south side of the Mishkan."
Shemot,40,25,And he set up the nerot (lamps) before Hashem ; as Hashem commanded Moshe.

Shemot,40,33,"And he erected the khatzer (courtyard) all around the Mishkan and the Mizbe'ach, and set up the Masach Sha'ar HaKhatzer. So Moshe finished the work."

Shemot,40,35,"And Moshe was not able to enter into the Ohel Mo'ed, because the [Shekinah] cloud abode thereon, and the Kavod Hashem filled the Mishkan."
Shemot,40,36,"And when the Anan was taken up from over the Mishkan, the Bnei Yisroel went onward in all their journeys;"
Shemot,40,37,"But if the Anan were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up."
Shemot,40,38,"For the Anan Hashem was upon the Mishkan by day, and Eish was on it by night, in the sight of all the Bais Yisroel, throughout all their journeys."
