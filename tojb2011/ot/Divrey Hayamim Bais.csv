Divrey Hayamim Bais,1,1,"And Sh'lomo Ben Dovid was strengthened in his kingdom, and Hashem Elohav was with him, and magnified him exceedingly."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,1,2,"Then Sh'lomo spoke unto kol Yisroel, to the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and to the shofetim, and to every Nasi in kol Yisroel, the Rashei HaAvot."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,1,3,"So Sh'lomo, and Kol HaKahal with him, went to the high place that was at Giv'on, for there was the Ohel Mo'ed HaElohim, which Moshe eved Hashem had made in the midbar."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,1,4,But the Aron HaElohim Dovid had brought up from Kiryat-Ye'arim to the place which Dovid had prepared for it; for he had pitched an Ohel for it at Yerushalayim.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,1,5,"Moreover the Mizbe'ach Hanechoshet, that Betzalel ben Uri ben Chur had made, he put in front of the Mishkan Hashem ; and Sh'lomo and HaKahal inquired of Him."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,1,6,"And Sh'lomo went up there to the Mizbe'ach Hanechoshet before Hashem , which was at the Ohel Mo'ed, and offered a thousand olot upon it."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,1,7,"In that lailah did Elohim appear unto Sh'lomo, and said unto him, Ask what I shall give thee."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,1,8,"And Sh'lomo said unto Elohim, Thou hast showed chesed gadol unto Dovid Avi, and hast made me to reign in his place."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,1,9,"Now, Hashem Elohim, let Thy Davar unto Dovid Avi be established, for Thou hast made me melech over Am Rav like the aphar ha'aretz in multitude."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,1,10,"Give me now chochmah and intelligence, that I may go out and come in before HaAm Hazeh, for who can judge this Thy people, that is so great?"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,1,11,"And Elohim said to Sh'lomo, Because this was in thine levav, and thou hast not asked osher, riches, or kavod, nor the nefesh of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked yamim rabbim (many days, long life) , but hast asked chochmah and intelligence for thyself, that thou mayest judge My people, over whom I have made thee melech,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,1,12,"Chochmah and intelligence is granted unto thee; and I will give thee osher, and riches, and kavod, such as none of the melachim have had that be before or after thee."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,1,13,"Then Sh'lomo came from his journey to the high place that was at Giv'on, from before the Ohel Mo'ed, to Yerushalayim, and reigned over Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,1,14,"And Sh'lomo gathered chariots and parashim (horsemen) ; and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand parashim, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with HaMelech at Yerushalayim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,1,15,"And HaMelech made kesef and zahav at Yerushalayim as plenteous as avanim, and cedar trees he made as abundant as the sycomore fig trees that are in the Shefelah."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,1,16,And Sh'lomo had susim imported from Mitzrayim and from Keve; the royal buyers purchased them from Keve.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,1,17,"And they imported from Mitzrayim, and then exported a merkavah (chariot) for six hundred shekels of kesef, and a sus (horse) for a hundred and fifty; and so they exported susim to all the melachim of the Chittim, and to the melachim of Aram (Syria)."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,2,1,"And Sh'lomo determined to build a Bais for the Shem of Hashem , and a Bais (palace) for his kingdom."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,2,2,"And Sh'lomo conscripted threescore and ten thousand ish to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand ish as stonecutters in the hill country, and three thousand and six hundred to be their foremen to oversee them."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,2,3,"And Sh'lomo sent to Churam Melech Tzor, saying, As thou didst deal with Dovid Avi, and didst send him cedars to build him a Bais (palace) to dwell therein, even so deal with me."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,2,4,"Hinei, I build a Bais for the Shem of Hashem Elohai, to set it apart as kodesh and to dedicate it to Him, and to burn before Him ketoret sammim (fragrant incense) , and for the ma'arekhet tamid (regular offering of the rows of bread) , and for the olot boker and erev, on the Shabbatot, and on every Rosh-Chodesh, and on the Mo'adei Hashem Eloheinu. This is for l'olam (forever) to Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,2,5,"And HaBeis which I build is gadol, for gadol is Eloheinu above kol HaElohim (all the g-ds)."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,2,6,"But who has the ko'ach to build Him a Bais, seeing the Shomayim and Shomayim of Shomayim cannot contain Him? Who am I then, that I should build Him a Bais, except to burn sacrifices before Him?"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,2,7,"Send me now therefore an ish chacham in zahav, and in kesef, and in nechoshet, and in barzel, and in purple, and in crimson, and in blue wool, and that has skill in the art of engraving to work with my chachamim in Yehudah and in Yerushalayim whom Dovid Avi did provide."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,2,8,"Send me also cedar, pine, and algum logs, from the Levanon, for I know that thy avadim have skill to cut timber in the Levanon; and, hinei, my avadim shall be with thy avadim,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,2,9,"Even to provide me lumber in abundance, for the Bais which I am about to build shall be gadol v'hafeleh (great and magnificent)."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,2,10,"And, hinei, I will give to thy avadim, the woodsmen that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten chittim, and twenty thousand measures of se'orim, and twenty thousand baths of yayin, and twenty thousand baths of shemen (olive oil)."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,2,11,"Then Churam Melech Tzor answered by letter, which he sent to Sh'lomo, Because Hashem hath loved His people, He hath made thee Melech over them."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,2,12,"Churam said moreover, Baruch Hashem Elohei Yisroel, that made Shomayim v'et HaAretz, Who hath given to Dovid HaMelech a ben chacham (wise son) , endued with seichel and binah, that might build a Bais for Hashem , and a Bais (palace) for his kingdom."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,2,13,"And now I have sent an ish chacham, endued with binah, namely my master craftsman Churam-Avi,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,2,14,"ben isha of the Banot Dan, and his av was an ish Tzor, trained to work in zahav, and in kesef, in nechoshet, in barzel, in avanim (stone) , and in etzim (wood) , in purple, in blue wool, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to engrave every kind of engraving, and to execute every design which shall be put to him, with thy chachamim, and with the chachmei adoni Dovid Avicha."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,2,15,"Now therefore the chittim, and the se'orim, the shemen, and the yayin, which adoni hath spoken of, let him send unto his avadim,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,2,16,"And we will cut etzim out of the Levanon, as much as thou shalt need; and we will float it to thee in rafts by yam to Yafo, and thou shalt carry it up to Yerushalayim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,2,17,"And Sh'lomo took a census of all the gerim that were in Eretz Yisroel, after the census wherewith Dovid Aviv had numbered them; and they were found a hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,2,18,"And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of burdens, and fourscore thousand to be stonecutters in the hill country, and three thousand and six hundred menatzkhim (foremen overseers) to keep HaAm working."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,3,1,"Then Sh'lomo began to build the Bais Hashem at Yerushalayim in Mt Moriyah, where Hashem appeared unto Dovid Avihu, in the makom (place) which Dovid had prepared in the goren (threshing floor) of Ornan the Yevusi."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,3,2,"And he began to build in the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,3,3,"Now these are the foundations which Sh'lomo laid for the building of the Bais HaElohim. The length by cubits using the middah harishonah (old standard) was threescore cubits, and the width twenty cubits."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,3,4,"And the Ulam that was in the front of the Bais (porch or vestibule in front of the Holy Place) , the length of it was according to the width of the Bais, twenty cubits, and the height was twenty, and he overlaid it within with zahav tahor."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,3,5,"And the Bais HaGadol he paneled with cypress, which he overlaid with zahav tov, and carved thereon timorim (palm trees) and sharsherot (chainwork)."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,3,6,"And he decorated the Bais with precious stones for tiferet (beauty) , and the zahav was zahav from Parvayim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,3,7,"He overlaid also the Bais, the ceiling beams, the thresholds, and the walls thereof, and the daletot (doors) thereof, with zahav; and carved keruvim on the walls."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,3,8,"And he made the Bais Kodesh HaKadashim, the length whereof was according to the width of the bais, twenty cubits long, and the width thereof twenty cubits, and he overlaid it with zahav tov of six hundred talents."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,3,9,And the weight of the masmerot (nails) was fifty shekels of zahav. And he overlaid the upper rooms with zahav.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,3,10,"And in the Bais Kodesh HaKadashim he made two keruvim of ma'aseh tza'atzu'im (sculpture work) , and overlaid them with zahav."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,3,11,"And the wings of the keruvim were twenty cubits long; one wing of the one keruv was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the Bais; and the other wing was likewise five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other keruv."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,3,12,"And one wing of the other keruv was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the Bais; and the other wing was five cubits also, joining to the wing of the other keruv."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,3,13,"The wings of these keruvim spread themselves forth twenty cubits; and they stood on their feet, and their faces turned inward."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,3,14,"And he made the Parochet of blue wool, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought keruvim thereon."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,3,15,"Also he made before the Bais two [freestanding] Ammudim (pillars) of thirty and five cubits high, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,3,16,"And he made sharsherot in the Devir, and put them on the rosh of the Ammudim; and made a hundred pomegranates, and put them on the sharsherot."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,3,17,"And he erected the Ammudim before the Heikhal, one on the right, and the other on the left; and called the shem of that on the right Yachin, and the shem of that on the left Boaz."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,4,1,"Moreover he made a Mizbe'ach nechoshet, twenty cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the width thereof, and ten cubits the height thereof."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,4,2,"Also he made a Yam Mutzak (Molten “Sea”) of ten cubits from brim to brim. It was round, and five cubits the height thereof, and a line of thirty cubits did completely encircle it."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,4,3,"And under it was the demut (likeness) of bulls, all around, ten per cubit, surrounding the Yam. Two rows of bulls were cast, when it was cast."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,4,4,"It stood upon shneym asar bakar (twelve bulls) , three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the Yam was set above upon them, and all their hindquarters were toward the inside."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,4,5,"And the thickness of it was a handbreadth, and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a kos, like the flower of a lily; and it received and held the capacity of shloshet alafim baths."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,4,6,"He made also ten kiyyorim (lavers, basins for washing) , and put five on the right and five on the left, to wash in them; such things as they offered for the olah (burnt offering) they washed in them; but the Yam was for the Kohanim to wash in."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,4,7,"And he made ten Menorot HaZahav as prescribed, and set them in the Heikhal, five on the right, and five on the left."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,4,8,"He made also ten Shulchanot, and placed them in the Heikhal, five on the right, and five on the left. And he made a hundred mizrekei zahav (golden basins)."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,4,9,"Furthermore he made the Khatzer HaKohanim, and the Azarah HaGedolal (the Great Temple Courtyard area) , and delatot laAzarah, and overlaid the daletot of them with nechoshet (bronze)."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,4,10,"And he set the Yam on the right, eastward, opposite the south."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,4,11,"And Churam made the sirot, and the shovels, and the mizrakot. And Churam finished the melachah that he was to make for Melech Sh'lomo for the Beis HaElohim,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,4,12,"The two Ammudim, and the bases, and the capitals which were on the top of the two Ammudim, and the two nettings to cover the two bases of the capitals which were on the top of the Ammudim;"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,4,13,"And four hundred pomegranates on the two nettings; two rows of pomegranates on each netting, to cover the two bases of the capitals which were upon the Ammudim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,4,14,"He made also stands, and kiyyorot made he upon the stands,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,4,15,"One Yam, and twelve bakar under it."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,4,16,"The sirot also, and the shovels, and the mizlagot, and all their instruments, did Churam-Avi make for Melech Sh'lomo for the Bais Hashem of nechoshet maruk."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,4,17,"In the plain of Yarden did HaMelech cast them, in the avi ha'adamah between Sukkot and Tzeredah."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,4,18,"Thus Sh'lomo made all these vessels in great abundance, for the weight of the nechoshet could not be found out."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,4,19,"And Sh'lomo made all the vessels that were for the Beis HaElohim, the Mizbe'ach HaZahav also, and the Shulchanot whereon the Lechem HaPanim was set;"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,4,20,"Moreover the Menorot with their nerot (lamps) , that they should burn as prescribed before the Devir, of zahav sagur;"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,4,21,"And the flowers, and the nerot (lamps) , and the tongs, he made of zahav, and that perfect zahav;"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,4,22,"And the snuffers, and the basins, and the ladles, and the firepans, of zahav sagur; and the Petach (Doorway) the Beis, the Daltot HaPenimiyyot (Inner Doors) thereof for the Kodesh HaKadashim, and the Daltot HaBeis laHeikhal, were of zahav."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,5,1,"Thus all the melachah (work) that Sh'lomo made for the Beis Hashem was completed; and Sh'lomo brought in all the things that Dovid Aviv had dedicated as kodesh; and the kesef, and the zahav, and all the articles, he put among the otzerot of the Bais HaElohim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,5,2,"Then Sh'lomo gathered unto Yerushalayim the Ziknei Yisroel, and kol Rashei HaMattot (all the Heads of the Tribes) , the Nesi'ei HaAvot (Family Chiefs) of the Bnei Yisroel, to bring up the Aron Brit Hashem out of Ir Dovid, which is Tziyon."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,5,3,"Kol Ish Yisroel assembled themselves unto the Melech in the Chag (Feast), which was in the seventh month."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,5,4,And all the Ziknei Yisroel came; and the Levi'im took up the Aron.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,5,5,"And they brought up the Aron, and the Ohel Mo'ed and kol Klei HaKodesh (all the Holy Articles) that were in the Ohel, these did the Kohanim and the Levi'im bring up."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,5,6,"Also HaMelech Sh'lomo, and Kol Adat Yisroel that were assembled unto him before the Aron, sacrificed tzon and bakar, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,5,7,"And the Kohanim brought in the Aron Brit Hashem unto its makom (place) , to the Devir HaBeis, into the Kodesh HaKadoshim, even under the wings of the Keruvim;"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,5,8,"For the Keruvim spread forth their wings over the place of the Aron, and the Keruvim covered over the Aron and the carrying poles thereof."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,5,9,"And they drew out the poles of the Aron, that the ends of the poles were seen from the Aron before the Devir; but they were not seen from the outside. And there it is unto this day."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,5,10,"There was nothing in the Aron except the two Luchot which Moshe put therein at Chorev, when Hashem made a Brit with the Bnei Yisroel, when they came out of Mitzrayim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,5,11,"And it came to pass, when the Kohanim were come out of the Kodesh (for all the Kohanim that were present were set apart as kodesh, and the divisions were not observed);"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,5,12,"Also the Levi'im which were the meshorarim (singers) , all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Yedutun, with their banim and their achim, being arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and lyres and kinnorot (harps) , stood at the east of the Mizbe'ach, and with them a hundred and twenty Kohanim sounding trumpets:"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,5,13,"It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and meshorarim were as one, making kol echad (one voice, one sound) to be heard in praising and thanking Hashem ; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and musical instruments, and praised Hashem , saying, Ki tov ki l'olam chasdo (For He is good; for His mercy endureth forever) , that then the Beis was filled with an anan, even the Beis Hashem,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,5,14,So that the Kohanim could not stand to minister by reason of the anan; for the Kavod Hashem had filled the Beis HaElohim.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,1,"Then said Sh'lomo, Hashem hath said that He would dwell in a dark cloud."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,2,"But I have built Thee a lofty Beis, even a place for Thee to dwell olamim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,3,"And HaMelech turned his face, v'yevarech at kol Kehal Yisroel, and all the Kehal Yisroel stood."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,4,"And he said, Baruch Hashem Elohei Yisroel, Who hath with His hands fulfilled that which He spoke with His mouth to Dovid Avi, saying,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,5,"Since HaYom when I brought forth Ami out of Eretz Mitzrayim I chose no city among all the Shivtei Yisroel to build a Bais in, that Shmi might be there; neither chose I any ish to be a Nagid over Ami Yisroel,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,6,"But I chose Yerushalayim, that Shmi might be there; and chose Dovid to be over Ami Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,7,Now it was in the levav Dovid Avi to build a Bais for the Shem of Hashem Elohei Yisroel.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,8,"But Hashem said to Dovid Avi, Because it was in levavcha to build a Bais for Shmi, thou didst well in that it was in levavcha."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,9,"Nevertheless thou shalt not build HaBeis; but bincha (your Son) which shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build HaBeis for Shmi."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,10," Hashem therefore hath performed His Devar that He hath spoken; for I am risen up after Dovid Avi, and I sit on the kisse Yisroel, just as Hashem promised, and I built HaBeis for the Shem of Hashem Elohei Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,11,"And in it have I put the Aron, wherein is the Brit Hashem that He cut with the Bnei Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,12,"And he stood before the Mizbe'ach Hashem in front kol Kehal Yisroel, and spread forth his hands;"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,13,"For Sh'lomo had made a kiyyor nechoshet (bronze platform) five cubits long, and five cubits wide, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the Azarah, and upon it he stood, and knelt down upon his knees before kol Kehal Yisroel, and spread forth his hands toward Shomayim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,14,"And said, Hashem Elohei Yisroel, ein kmocha Elohim (there is no G-d like Thee) in Shomayim, nor in Ha'aretz; shomer HaBrit, who showest chesed unto Thy avadim, that walk before Thee with all their hearts."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,15,"Thou which has been shomer over Thy eved Dovid Avi over that which Thou hast promised him; and spoke with Thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with Thine hand, as it is this day."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,16,"Now therefore, Hashem Elohei Yisroel, be shomer over Dovid Avi to keep that which Thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee an ish in My sight to sit upon the Kisse Yisroel; if only Banecha are shomer over their way to walk in My torah, as thou hast walked before Me."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,17,"Now then, Hashem Elohei Yisroel, let Thy Davar come true, which Thou hast spoken unto Thy eved Dovid."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,18,"But will Elohim really dwell with HaAdam on ha'aretz? Hinei, Shomayim and the Shmei HaShomayim cannot contain Thee; how much less this Beis which I built!"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,19,"Yet give attention to the tefillah of Thy eved, and to his techinnah (supplication) , O Hashem Elohai, to pay heed unto the cry and the tefillah which Thy eved prayeth before Thee;"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,20,"That Thine eyes may be open toward this Beis yomam valailah, toward the makom (place) whereof Thou hast said that Thou wouldest put Shimcha there; to pay heed unto the tefillah which Thy eved prayeth toward this makom."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,21,"Pay heed therefore unto the tachanunei Avdecha (suppplications of Thy servant) , and of Thy people Yisroel, which they shall daven toward this place; hear Thou from Thy dwelling place, even from Shomayim; and when Thou hearest, salachta (forgive)."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,22,"If an ish sin against his neighbor, and he is made to swear under oath and he swears an oath before Thine Mizbe'ach in this Beis,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,23,"Then hear Thou from Shomayim, and act, and judge Thy avadim, by requiting the guilty, by recompensing his way upon his own rosh; and by justifying the tzaddik, by giving him according to his tzedakah."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,24,"And if thy people Yisroel be defeated before the oyev (enemy) , because they have sinned against Thee; and shall return and confess Shmecha, and pray and make techinnah before Thee in this Beis,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,25,"Then hear Thou from Shomayim, and forgive the sin of Thy people Yisroel, and bring them back to HaAdamah which Thou gave to them and to Avoteichem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,26,"When Shomayim is shut up, and there is no matar (rain) , because they have sinned against Thee; yet if they pray toward this place, and confess Shmecha, and turn from their sin, when Thou dost afflict them;"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,27,"Then hear Thou from Shomayim, and forgive the sin of Thy avadim, and of Thy people Yisroel, when Thou hast taught them the Derech HaTovah, wherein they should walk; and send matar upon Thy land, which Thou hast given unto Thy people for a nachalah."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,28,"If there be ra'av (hunger, famine) in the land, if there be dever, if there be blight, or mildew, locust, or grass-hopper; if their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever nega or machalah there be,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,29,"Then what tefillah or what techinnah soever shall be made of kol ha'adam, or of all Thy people Yisroel, when every one shall know his own nega and his own pain, and shall spread forth his hands in this Beis,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,30,"Then hear Thou from Shomayim Thy dwelling place, and forgive, and render unto every man according unto all his ways, whose lev Thou knowest; (for Thou only knowest the hearts of the Bnei HaAdam),"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,31,"That they may fear Thee, to walk in Thy ways, so long as they live in HaAdamah which Thou gavest unto Avoteinu."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,32,"Also concerning the nokhri, who is not of Thy people Yisroel, but is come from a far country for the sake of Shimcha Hagadol, Thy yad hachazakeh, and Thy zero'a stretched out; if they come and pray toward this Beis,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,33,"Then hear Thou from Shomayim, even from Thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the nokhri calleth for to Thee, that kol Amei Ha'aretz may know Shmecha, and fear Thee, as doth Thy people Yisroel, and may know that this Beis which I have built is called by Shimcha."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,34,"If Thy people go out to milchamah against their enemies by the derech that Thou shalt send them, and they pray unto Thee toward this city which Thou hast chosen, and the Beis which I have built for Shmecha,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,35,"Then hear Thou from Shomayim their tefillah and their techinnah, and uphold their mishpat."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,36,"If they sin against Thee, (for there is no adam which sinneth not) , and Thou be angry with them, and deliver them over before their enemies, and they carry them away captive unto an Eretz rechokah or kerovah,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,37,"Yet if they change in their heart in the land where they are carried captive, and repent and supplicate unto Thee in the land of their captivity, saying, Chatanu (we have sinned) , he'evnu (we have done wrong) , and rashanu (we acted wickedly);"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,38,"If they return to Thee with all their lev and with all their nefesh in the land of their captivity, where they have carried them captive, and pray toward their land, which Thou gavest unto Avotam, and toward HaIr which Thou hast chosen, and toward the Beis which I have built for Thy Shem,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,39,"Then hear Thou from Shomayim, even from Thy dwelling place, their tefillah and their techinnah, and uphold their mishpat, and forgive Thy people which have sinned against Thee."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,40,"Now, Elohai, may Thine eyes be open, and let Thine ears be attentive unto the tefillah that is davened in this place."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,41,"Now therefore arise, Hashem Elohim, into Thy resting place, Thou, and the Aron of Thy might; let Thy Kohanim, Hashem Elohim, be clothed with Teshu'ah, and let Thy Chasidim rejoice in goodness."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,6,42," Hashem Elohim, turn not away the face of Thine Moshiach. Remember the Chasdei Dovid Avdecha."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,7,1,"Now when Sh'lomo had made an end of davening, the eish came down from Shomayim, and consumed the olah and the zevakhim; and the kavod Hashem filled HaBeis."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,7,2,"And the Kohanim could not enter into the Beis Hashem , because the kavod Hashem had filled the Beis Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,7,3,"And when all the Bnei Yisroel saw how the eish came down, and the kavod Hashem upon HaBeis, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the ritzpah (floor, pavement) and worshiped, and gave thanks to Hashem , saying, Ki tov ki l'olam chasdo (For He is good; for His mercy endureth forever)."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,7,4,Then HaMelech and kol HaAm offered zevach before Hashem.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,7,5,"And HaMelech Sh'lomo offered zevach of 22,000 bakar, and 120,000 tzon; so HaMelech and kol HaAm dedicated the Beis HaElohim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,7,6,"And the Kohanim stood at their mishmerot (watches) ; the Levi'im also with kelei shir Hashem, (musical instruments of Hashem) which Dovid HaMelech had made to give thanks to Hashem — ki l'oham chasdo (for His mercy endureth forever) — whenever Dovid praised by their means; and the Kohanim sounded khatzotzrot (trumpets) opposite them, and kol Yisroel stood."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,7,7,"Moreover Sh'lomo set apart as kodesh the toch hekhatzer (center of the courtyard) that was in front of the Beis Hashem ; for there he offered HaOlot and the chelvei hashelamim (fat of peace offerings) , because the Mizbe'ach hanechoshet which Sh'lomo had made was not able to receive the Olot, and the Mincha, and HaChalavim (the fats)."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,7,8,"Also at the same time Sh'lomo kept the Chag shivat yamim, and kol Yisroel with him, a Kahal Gadol Me'od, from the Levo (Approach) Chamat unto the Wadi Mitzrayim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,7,9,"And on the Yom HaShemini they held an Atzeret (solemn assembly) ; for they kept the chanukat HaMizbe'ach (dedication of the altar), shivat yamim, and the Chag shivat yamim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,7,10,"And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent HaAm away into their ohalim joyful and tovei lev for the goodness that Hashem had showed unto Dovid, and to Sh'lomo, and to Yisroel His Am."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,7,11,"Thus Sh'lomo finished the Beis Hashem , and the Beis HaMelech; and all that came into the lev Sh'lomo to do in the Beis Hashem , and in his own palace, he prosperously effected."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,7,12,"And Hashem appeared to Sh'lomo balailah, and said unto him, I have heard thy tefillah, and have chosen this makom for Myself for a Beis Zevach."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,7,13,"When I shut up Shomayim that there be no matar, or when I command the locusts to devour HaAretz, or when I send dever among Ami (My People);"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,7,14,"If Ami, which are called by Shmi, shall humble themselves, and daven, and seek my face, and turn from their derakhim hara'im (wicked ways) , then will I hear from Shomayim, and will forgive their chattat, and will heal their land."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,7,15,"Now Mine eyes shall be open, and Mine ears attentive unto the tefillah that is made in Makom HaZeh."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,7,16,"For now have I chosen and set apart as kodesh HaBeis HaZeh, that Shmi may be there ad olam, and Mine eyes and Mine lev shall be there kol hayamim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,7,17,"And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before Me, as Dovid Avicha walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and shalt observe My chukkot and My mishpatim;"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,7,18,"Then will I establish the kisse of thy Malchut, just as I have covenanted with Dovid Avicha, saying, Lo yikaret lecha ish moshel b'Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,7,19,"But if ye turn away, and forsake My chukkot and My mitzvot, which I have set before you, and shall go and serve elohim acherim, and worship them,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,7,20,"Then will I uproot them out of My Adamah which I have given them; and HaBeis HaZeh, which I have set apart as kodesh for Shmi, will I cast out of My sight, and will make it to be a Mashal (byword) and an object of ridicule among Kol haAmim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,7,21,"And HaBeis HaZeh, which is elyon, shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it; so that he shall say, Why hath Hashem done thus unto HaAretz HaZot, and unto HaBeis Hazeh?"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,7,22,"And it shall be answered, Because they forsook Hashem Elohei Avoteihem, Who brought them forth out of Eretz Mitzrayim, and they laid hold on elohim acherim, and worshiped them, and served them; therefore hath He brought all this ra'ah upon them."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,8,1,"And it came to pass at the end of esrim shanah, wherein Sh'lomo had built the Beis Hashem , and his own bais (palace),"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,8,2,"That the cities which Churam had restored to Sh'lomo, Sh'lomo rebuilt them, and caused the Bnei Yisroel to dwell there."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,8,3,"And Sh'lomo went to Chamat Tzovah, and captured it."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,8,4,"And he built Tadmor in the midbar, and all the storage towns, which he built in Chamat."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,8,5,"Also he rebuilt Upper Beit-Choron, and Lower Beit-Choron, fortified cities, with walls, gates, and bars,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,8,6,"And Ba'alat, and all the storage towns that Sh'lomo had, and all the towns for the chariots, and the towns for the parashim (horsemen, cavalry) all the cheshek Sh'lomo (desire of Solomon) that he desired to build in Yerushalayim, and in the Levanon, and throughout all the eretz of his Memshalet."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,8,7,"As for kol haAm that were left of the Chitti, and HaEmori, and the Perizzi, and the Chivi, and the Yevusi, who were not of Yisroel,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,8,8,"From their banim, who were left after them in HaAretz, whom the Bnei Yisroel consumed not, them did Sh'lomo conscript for forced labor until yom hazeh."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,8,9,"But of the Bnei Yisroel did Sh'lomo make no avadim for his melachah; for they were anshei milchamah, and commanders of his officers, and commanders of his chariots and parash."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,8,10,"And these were the chief of the officials of Sh'lomo HaMelech, even two hundred and fifty, that exercised authority over HaAm."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,8,11,"And Sh'lomo brought up the Bat Pharaoh out of Ir Dovid unto the palace that he had built for her, for he said, Isha li (wife for me) shall not dwell in the Bais Dovid Melech Yisroel, because the places whereunto the Aron Hashem hath come are Kodesh."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,8,12,"Then Sh'lomo offered up Olot unto Hashem on the Mizbe'ach Hashem , which he had built before the Ulam,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,8,13,"Even according to the requirement of each day on its day, offering according to the mitzvat Moshe, on the Shabbatot, and on Rosh Chodesh, and on the Mo'adot, three times in the year, even in the Chag HaMatzot, and in the Chag HaShavuot, and in the Chag HaSukkot."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,8,14,"And he appointed, according to the mishpat Dovid Aviv, the machlekot (divisions) of the Kohanim to their avodah service, and the Levi'im to their mishmerot (watches) , to praise and minister before the Kohanim, as the requirement of every yom required; the Sho'arim (Gatekeepers) also by their machlekot (divisions) at every sha'ar; for thus was the mitzvot Dovid Ish HaElohim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,8,15,"And they deviated not from the mitzvat HaMelech unto the Kohanim and Levi'im concerning any matter, or concerning the otzarot."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,8,16,Now all the work of Sh'lomo was carried out from the yom musad (day of the foundation) of the Beis Hashem until its completion. So the Beis Hashem was perfected.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,8,17,"Then went Sh'lomo to Etzyon-Gever, and to Eilot, on the seacoast of Eretz Edom."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,8,18,"And Churam sent him by the hands of his avadim oniyot, and avadim that were experienced seamen; and they went with the avadim of Sh'lomo to Ophir, and took from there four hundred and fifty talents of zahav, and brought them to Sh'lomo HaMelech."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,9,1,"And when the Malkat Sheva (Queen of Sheba) heard of the fame of Sh'lomo, she came to test Sh'lomo with chidot (hard questions, riddles) at Yerushalayim, with a very great caravan, and camels that carried spices, and zahav in abundance, and precious stones; and when she was come to Sh'lomo, she communed with him of all that was in her levav."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,9,2,And Sh'lomo gave answer to all her questions; and there was nothing hid from Sh'lomo which he explained not to her.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,9,3,"And when the Malkat Sheva had seen the Chochmat Sh'lomo, and HaBais (the Palace) that he had built,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,9,4,"And the ma'akhal (food) of his shulchan, and the moshav of his avadim, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his aliyah (ascent) by which he went up to the Beis Hashem ; there was no more ruach in her."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,9,5,"And she said to HaMelech, Emes was the davar (report) which I heard in mine own country about thine acts, and of thy chochmah;"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,9,6,"Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it; and, hinei, the one half of the greatness of thy chochmah was not told me, for thou exceedest the report that I heard."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,9,7,"Ashrei are thy anashim, and ashrei are these thy avadim, which stand continually before thee, and hear thy chochmah."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,9,8,"Baruch Hashem Eloheicha Who delighted in thee to set thee on His kisse, to be Melech for Hashem Eloheicha, because Eloheicha loved Yisroel, to establish them l'olam, therefore He made thee Melech over them, to maintain Mishpat and Tzedakah."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,9,9,"And she gave HaMelech a hundred and twenty talents of zahav, and spices in great abundance, and precious stones; neither was there ever any such spice as the Malkat Sheva gave Sh'lomo HaMelech."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,9,10,"And the avadim also of Churam, and the avadim of Sh'lomo, which brought zahav from Ophir, brought atzei algummim (algum trees) and precious stones."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,9,11,"And HaMelech made of the atzei algummim steps for the Beis Hashem , and for the Beis HaMelech, and kinnorot and nevalim for the musicians; and there were none such seen before in the Eretz Yehudah."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,9,12,"And Sh'lomo HaMelech gave to Malkat Sheva all her chefetz, whatsoever she asked, beside such that she had brought unto HaMelech. So she turned, and went away to her own land, she and her avadim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,9,13,Now the weight of zahav that came to Sh'lomo in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of zahav;
Divrey Hayamim Bais,9,14,Besides that which traders and merchants brought. And all the melachim of Arabia and governors of the country brought zahav and kesef to Sh'lomo.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,9,15,And Melech Sh'lomo made 200 shields of hammered zahav; 600 measures of hammered zahav went to one shield.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,9,16,And 300 moginnim he made of hammered zahav; 300 measures of zahav went to one mogen. And HaMelech put them in Beis Ya'ar HaLevanon (House of the Forest of Levanon).
Divrey Hayamim Bais,9,17,Moreover HaMelech made a kisse shen gadol (great ivory throne) and overlaid it with zahav tahor.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,9,18,"And there were six steps to the kisse, with a kevesh (ramp) of zahav, which was attached to the kisse, and arms on each side of the seat, and two aroyot (lions) standing by the armrests;"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,9,19,And 12 aroyot stood there on the one side and on the other upon 6 steps. There was nothing like it made for any other mamlechah.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,9,20,"And all the kelei mashkeh (drinking vessels) of Sh'lomo HaMelech were of zahav, and all the kelei Beis Ya'ar HaLevanon were of pure zahav; none were of kesef; it was not accounted as anything in the days of Sh'lomo."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,9,21,"HaMelech had a fleet of oniyyot that went to Tarshish with the avadim of Churam. Once every three years came the oniyyot Tarshish bringing zahav, and kesef, ivory, and monkeys, and peacocks."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,9,22,And Sh'lomo HaMelech surpassed all the Malkhei HaAretz in riches and chochmah.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,9,23,"And all the Malkhei Ha'Aretz sought the presence of Sh'lomo, to hear his chochmah, that HaElohim had put in his lev."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,9,24,"And they brought every ish his minchah (present) , kelei kesef, kelei zahav, and clothing, weapons, and spices, susim, and peradim (mules) , at a set rate."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,9,25,"And Sh'lomo had four thousand stalls for susim and markovot (chariots) , and twelve thousand parashim whom he kept in the chariot cities, and with HaMelech at Yerushalayim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,9,26,"And he reigned over all the melachim from the River even unto the Eretz Pelishtim, and to the border of Mitzrayim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,9,27,"And HaMelech made kesef in Yerushalayim as common as stones, and cedar trees he made like sycamore trees that are in the Shefelah in abundance."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,9,28,"And they imported unto Sh'lomo susim out of Mitzrayim, and from all the lands."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,9,29,"Now the rest of the Divrei Sh'lomo, harishonim and ha'acharonim, are they not written in the Divrei Natan HaNavi, and in the Nevu'at Achiyah the Shiloni, and in the chazot Yadai HaChozer against Yarov'am ben Nevat?"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,9,30,And Sh'lomo reigned in Yerushalayim over kol Yisroel arba'im shanah.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,9,31,"And Sh'lomo slept with Avotav, and he was buried in Ir Dovid Aviv. And Rechav'am Bno reigned in his place."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,10,1,"And Rechav'am went to Shechem, for to Shechem were kol Yisroel come to make him melech."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,10,2,"And it came to pass, when Yarov'am ben Nevat, who was in Mitzrayim, where he fled from the presence of Sh'lomo HaMelech heard it, that Yarov'am returned out of Mitzrayim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,10,3,"And they sent and called him. So Yarov'am and kol Yisroel came and spoke to Rechav'am, saying,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,10,4,"Avicha made our ol (yoke) kasheh (difficult, harsh) ; now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous avodas Avicha, and his heavy ol (yoke) that he put upon us, and we will serve thee."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,10,5,"And he said unto them, Shuvu (come back, return) unto me after shloshet yamin. And HaAm departed."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,10,6,"And HaMelech Rechav'am took counsel with the Zekenim that had stood before Sh'lomo Avi while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye me to return answer to HaAm HaZeh?"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,10,7,"And they spoke unto him, saying, If thou be kind to HaAm HaZeh, and please them, and speak devarim tovim to them, they will be thy avadim kol hayamim (all the days)."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,10,8,"But he forsook the Atzat HaZekenim they gave him, and took counsel with the yeladim that were brought up with him, that stood before him."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,10,9,"And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return answer to HaAm HaZeh, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat haOl that Avicha did put upon us?"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,10,10,"And the yeladim that grew up with him spoke unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer HaAm that spoke unto thee, saying, Avicha made our ol (yoke) heavy, but make thou it somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger is thicker than the loins of Avi."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,10,11,"For whereas Avi put an ol kaved (a heavy yoke) upon you, I will add more to your ol (yoke) . Avi chastised you with shotim (whips) , but I will chastise you with akrabim (scorpions)."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,10,12,"So Yarov'am and kol HaAm came to Rechav'am on the Yom HaShelishi, as HaMelech said, Shuva (return) to me on the Yom HaShelishi."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,10,13,"And HaMelech answered them kashah (harshly) ; and HaMelech Rechav'am forsook the Atzat HaZekenim,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,10,14,"And answered them after the Atzat HaYeladim, saying, Avi made your ol (yoke) heavy, but I will add thereto; Avi chastised you with shotim (whips) , but I will chastise you with akrabim (scorpions)."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,10,15,"So HaMelech paid heed not unto HaAm, for the nesibah (turn of events, circumstance) was of HaElohim, that Hashem might perform His Devar, which He spoke by the yad Achiyah HaShiloni to Yarov'am ben Nevat."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,10,16,"And when kol Yisroel saw that HaMelech would not pay heed unto them, HaAm answered HaMelech, saying, What chelek have we in Dovid? We have none nachalah in Ben Yishai. Every ish to your ohalim, O Yisroel; and now, Dovid, see to thine own Bais. So kol Yisroel went to their ohalim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,10,17,"But as for the Bnei Yisroel that dwelt in the towns of Yehudah, Rechav'am reigned over them."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,10,18,"Then HaMelech Rechav'am sent Hadoram who was over the mas (tax, tribute) ; and the Bnei Yisroel stoned him with stones, that he died. But HaMelech Rechav'am made speed to get up into his merkavah, to escape to Yerushalayim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,10,19,And Yisroel rebelled against the Bais Dovid unto Hayom Hazeh.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,11,1,"And when Rechav'am was come to Yerushalayim, he gathered of the Bais Yehudah and Binyamin a hundred and fourscore thousand bachur oseh milchamah (chosen men, which were warriors) , to make war against Yisroel, that he might restore the mamlachah to Rechav'am."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,11,2,"But the Devar Hashem came to Shema'yah the Ish HaElohim, saying,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,11,3,"Speak unto Rechav'am ben Sh'lomo Melech Yehudah, and to kol Yisroel in Yehudah and Binyamin, saying,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,11,4,"Thus saith Hashem , Ye shall not go up, nor make war against your achim. Shuvu (return) every ish to his bais, for this thing is done from Me. And they obeyed the divrei Hashem , and returned back from going against Yarov'am."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,11,5,"And Rechav'am dwelt in Yerushalayim, and built arim lematzor (cities for defense) in Yehudah."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,11,6,"He built even Beit-Lechem, and Eitam, and Tekoa,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,11,7,"Beit-Tzur, Sokhoh, Adullam,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,11,8,"Gat, Mareshah, Ziph,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,11,9,"And Adorayim, and Lakhish, and Azekah,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,11,10,"And Tzorah, and Ayalon, and Chevron, which are in Yehudah and in Binyamin arei metzurot (fortified cities)."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,11,11,"And he fortified the metzurot (fortifications) , and put negidim (rulers) in them, and otzerot ma'achal (storage places of food) , and of shemen and yayin."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,11,12,"And in all the cities he put shields and spears, and made them exceeding strong, having Yehudah and Binyamin on his side."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,11,13,And the Kohanim and the Levi'im that were in kol Yisroel availed themselves to him from all their territories.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,11,14,"For the Levi'im abandoned their common-lands and their achuzzah (possession, estate) and came to Yehudah and Yerushalayim; for Yarov'am and his banim had cast them off from executing the office of Kohen unto Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,11,15,"And he ordained him kohanim for the high places, and for the se'irim (goat idols, demons) and for the agalim (calf idols) which he had made."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,11,16,"And after them from all the Shivtei Yisroel such as set their hearts to seek Hashem Elohei Yisroel came to Yerushalayim, to sacrifice unto Hashem Elohei Avoteihem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,11,17,"So they strengthened the Malchut Yehudah, and made Rechav'am ben Sh'lomo strong, shanim shalosh. For shanim shalosh they walked in the Derech Dovid u'Sh'lomo."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,11,18,"And Rechav'am took him Machalat bat Yerimot Ben Dovid as isha, and Avihayil bat Eliav ben Yishai,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,11,19,"Which bore him banim: Ye'ush, and Shemaryah, and Zaham."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,11,20,"And after her he took Ma'achah bat Avshalom, who bore him Aviyah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shlomit."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,11,21,"And Rechav'am loved Ma'achah bat Avshalom more than any of his nashim and his pilagshim; (for he took eighteen nashim, and threescore pilagshim, and fathered twenty and eight banim, and threescore banot.)"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,11,22,"And Rechav'am made Aviyah ben Ma'achah the rosh, to be nagid among his achim, for he intended to make him melech."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,11,23,"And he acted wisely, and dispersed kol banim of him throughout all the lands of Yehudah and Binyamin, unto all of the arei hametzurot (fortified cities) ; and he gave them mazon (provision, food) in abundance. And he took for them many wives."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,12,1,"And it came to pass, when Rechav'am had established the malchut, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the Torat Hashem , and kol Yisroel with him."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,12,2,"And it came to pass, that in the shanah hachamishit of Melech Rechav'am Shishak Melech Mitzrayim came up against Yerushalayim, because they were unfaithful to Hashem,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,12,3,"With 1,200 chariots, and 60,000 parashim, and troops without number that came with him out of Mitzrayim, the Luvim, the Sukiyim, and the Cushim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,12,4,"And he captured the arei hametzurot (fortified cities) which are of Yehudah, and came as far as Yerushalayim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,12,5,"Then came Shema'yah HaNavi to Rechav'am, and to the Sarim of Yehudah, that were assembled in Yerushalayim because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith Hashem , Ye have forsaken me, and therefore have I also abandoned you in the yad Shishak."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,12,6,"Whereupon the Sarim (princes) of Yisroel and HaMelech humbled themselves; and they said, Tzaddik Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,12,7,"And when Hashem saw that they humbled themselves, the Devar Hashem came to Shema'yah, saying, They have humbled themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some peleitah (deliverance, rescue) ; and My chamah (anger, wrath) shall not be poured out upon Yerushalayim by the yad Shishak."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,12,8,"Nevertheless they shall be his avadim; that they may differentiate My avodah, and the avodat mamlechut of the lands."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,12,9,"So Shishak Melech Mitzrayim came up against Yerushalayim, and carried away the otzerot of the Beis Hashem , and the otzerot Bais HaMelech. He took all; he carried away also the moginei hazahav (shields of gold) which Sh'lomo had made."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,12,10,"Instead of which HaMelech Rechav'am made moginei nechoshet, and committed them to the hands of the commanders of the guard, the Shomrim who kept the Petach Bais Hamelech."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,12,11,"And as often as HaMelech entered into the Beis Hashem , the guard came and got the shields, and afterward brought them again into the guardroom."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,12,12,"And when he humbled himself, the Af Hashem turned from him, that He would not destroy him altogether; and also in Yehudah things went well."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,12,13,"So HaMelech Rechav'am strengthened himself in Yerushalayim, and reigned; for Rechav'am was one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Yerushalayim, HaIr that Hashem had chosen out of all the Shivtei Yisroel, to put Shmo there. And the shem immo was Na'amah HaAmmonit."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,12,14,"And he did rah, because he set not his lev to seek Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,12,15,"Now the acts of Rechav'am, harishonim and ha'acharonim, are they not written in the Divrei Shema'yah HaNavi, and of Iddo HaChozer with genealogies? And there were milchamot between Rechav'am and Yarov'am continually."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,12,16,"And Rechav'am slept with Avotav, and was buried in Ir Dovid; and Aviyah bno reigned in his place."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,13,1,Now in the eighteenth year of Melech Yarov'am began Aviyah to reign over Yehudah.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,13,2,He reigned 3 shanim in Yerushalayim. And the shem immo was Michayah bat Uriel of Giv'ah. And there was milchamah between Aviyah and Yarov'am.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,13,3,"And Aviyah led the milchamah with an army of gibborei milchamah, even 400 elef ish bachur. Yarov'am also drew up for milchamah against him with 800 elef ish bachur, gibbor chayil."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,13,4,"And Aviyah stood up upon Mt Tzemarayim, which is in the hill country of Ephrayim, and said, Hear me, thou Yarov'am, and kol Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,13,5,"Ought ye not to know that Hashem Elohei Yisroel gave the Mamlachah over Yisroel to Dovid l'olam (forever) , even to him and to his banim by a Brit Melach?"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,13,6,"Yet Yarov'am ben Nevat eved Sh'lomo ben Dovid is risen up, and hath rebelled against Adonav."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,13,7,"And there are gathered unto him anashim rekim, the Bnei Beliyaal, and have strengthened themselves against Rechav'am ben Sh'lomo, when Rechav'am was na'ar and rakh levav (faint-hearted) , and could not withstand them."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,13,8,"And now ye think to withstand the Mamlechet Hashem in the yad Bnei Dovid; and ye be a great multitude, and there are with you eglei zahav, which Yarov'am made you for elohim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,13,9,"Have ye not cast out the Kohanim of Hashem , the Bnei Aharon, and the Levi'im, and have made you kohanim after the manner of the peoples of other lands? So whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bull and 7 rams, the same may be a kohen of them that are no elohim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,13,10,"But as for us, Hashem is Eloheinu, and we have not forsaken Him, and the Kohanim, mesharetim unto Hashem , are the Bnei Aharon, and the Levi'im do their work;"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,13,11,"And they burn unto Hashem baboker baboker and baerev baerev olot and ketoret sammim; the array of lechem is also set in order upon the shulchan hatahor; and the menorah hazahav with the nerot thereof is lit erev ba'erev, for we are the Shomrim of the Mishmeret Hashem Eloheinu; but ye have forsaken Him."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,13,12,"And, hinei, HaElohim Himself is with us as Rosh, and His Kohanim have their chatzotzerot to sound the alarm against you. O Bnei Yisroel, fight ye not against Hashem Elohei Avoteichem; for ye shall not prosper."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,13,13,"But Yarov'am caused a ma'arav to come about behind them so that they were before Yehudah, and the ma'arav was behind them."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,13,14,"And when Yehudah turned, hinei, the milchamah was before and behind, and they cried unto Hashem , and the Kohanim sounded the battle trumpets."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,13,15,"Then the Ish Yehudah gave a shout, and as the Ish Yehudah shouted, it came to pass, that HaElohim routed Yarov'am and kol Yisroel before Aviyah and Yehudah."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,13,16,"And the Bnei Yisroel fled before Yehudah, and Elohim delivered them into their yad."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,13,17,And Aviyah and his army slaughtered them with a makkah rabbah (great slaughter) ; so there fell down slain of Yisroel five hundred thousand ish bachur.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,13,18,"Thus the Bnei Yisroel were subdued at that time, and the Bnei Yehudah prevailed, because they relied upon Hashem Elohei Avoteihem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,13,19,"And Aviyah pursued after Yarov'am, and took cities from him: Beit-El with the towns thereof, and Yeshanah with the villages thereof, and Ephrayim with the villages thereof."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,13,20,"Neither did Yarov'am recover ko'ach again in the days of Aviyah; and Hashem struck him, and he died."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,13,21,"But Aviyah grew strong, and married fourteen nashim, and fathered twenty and two banim, and sixteen banot."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,13,22,"And the rest of the acts of Aviyah, and his deeds, and his words, are written in the Midrash HaNavi Iddo."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,14,1,"So Aviyah slept with Avotav, and they buried him in Ir Dovid, and Asa bno reigned in his place. In his days HaAretz was at peace eser shanim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,14,2,And Asa did that which was hatov and yashar in the eyes of Hashem Elohav;
Divrey Hayamim Bais,14,3,"For he took away the mizbechot hanekhar (foreign altars) , and the high places, and smashed the matzevot, and cut down the Asherim;"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,14,4,"And commanded Yehudah to seek Hashem Elohei Avoteihem, and to observe the Torah and the Mitzvah."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,14,5,Also he took away out of all the towns of Yehudah the high places and the chammanim (sun-pillar idols) ; and the mamlachah was at peace under him.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,14,6,"And he built arei metzurah in Yehudah; for HaAretz was at peace, and he had no milchamah in those years, because Hashem had given him rest."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,14,7,"Therefore he said unto Yehudah, Let us build up these cities, and make about them chomah, and migdalim, gates, and bars. HaAretz is yet before us, because we have sought Hashem Eloheinu, we have sought Him, and He hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,14,8,"And Asa had an army of men that bore shields and spears, out of Yehudah three hundred thousand; and out of Binyamin, that bore mogen and drew keshet (bow) , two hundred and fourscore elef; all these were gibborei chayil."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,14,9,"And there came out against them Zerach HaCushi with a host of elef alafim, and three hundred merkavot; and came as far as Mareshah."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,14,10,"Then Asa went out against him, and they took up position for the milchamah in the valley of Tzephatah at Mareshah."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,14,11,"And Asa cried unto Hashem Elohav, and said, Hashem , there is none besides Thee to help, whether with rav, or with them that have no ko'ach. Help us, Hashem Eloheinu, for we rely on Thee; in Shimecha we go against this multitude. Hashem Thou art Eloheinu; let no enosh prevail against Thee."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,14,12,"So Hashem struck down HaCushim before Asa, and before Yehudah, and HaCushim fled."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,14,13,"And Asa and HaAm that were with him pursued them as far as Gerar, and HaCushim fell, until they could not survive, for they were crushed before Hashem , and before His Machaneh. They carried off very much plunder."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,14,14,"And they destroyed all the towns around Gerar; for the Pachad Hashem fell upon them, and they plundered all the towns, for there was exceeding much booty in them."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,14,15,"They attacked also the ohalim of herdsmen, and carried off tzon and gemalim in abundance, and returned to Yerushalayim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,15,1,And the Ruach Elohim came upon Azaryahu ben Oded;
Divrey Hayamim Bais,15,2,"And he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and kol Yehudah and Binyamin. Hashem is with you, while ye be with Him; if ye seek Him, He will be found of you; if ye forsake Him, He will forsake you."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,15,3,"Now for yamim rabbim Yisroel hath been without the Elohei Emes, and without a Kohen Moreh, and without Torah."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,15,4,"But when they in their tzoros did turn unto Hashem Elohei Yisroel, and sought Him, He was found by them."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,15,5,"And in those times there was no shalom to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but mehumot rabbot (great turmoil) was upon all the inhabitants of the lands."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,15,6,"And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city, for Elohim did trouble them with every tzuris."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,15,7,"Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak, for there is sachar (reward) for your pe'ulah (work)."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,15,8,"And when Asa heard these words, and the nevu'ah of Oded HaNavi, he took courage, and put away the shikkutzim (abominable idols) from kol Eretz Yehudah and Binyamin, and from the cities which he had captured from Mt Ephrayim, and renewed the Mizbe'ach Hashem , that was in front of the Ulam Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,15,9,"And he gathered all Yehudah and Binyamin, and the gerim with them from Ephrayim and Menasheh, and from Shim'on, for they fell to him from Yisroel in abundance, when they saw that Hashem Elohav was with him."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,15,10,"So they gathered themselves together at Yerushalayim in the chodesh hashelishi, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,15,11,"And they offered unto Hashem on that day, of the plunder which they had brought back, 700 bakar and 7,000 tzon."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,15,12,And they entered into the Brit to seek Hashem Elohei Avoteihem with all their lev and with all their nefesh;
Divrey Hayamim Bais,15,13,"That whosoever would not seek Hashem Elohei Yisroel should be put to death, whether katan or gadol, whether ish or isha."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,15,14,"And they swore unto Hashem with a kol gadol, and with teruah, and with trumpets, and with shoferot."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,15,15,"And all Yehudah rejoiced at the shevu'ah, for they had sworn with all their lev, and sought Him with their whole ratzon; and He was found by them; and Hashem gave them rest all around."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,15,16,"And also concerning Ma'achah em Asa HaMelech, he deposed her from being gevirah, because she had made to Asherah a mifletzet, and Asa cut down her mifletzet, and ground it up, and burned it at the Wadi Kidron."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,15,17,But the high places were not removed from Yisroel; nevertheless the levav Asa was shalem all his days.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,15,18,"And he brought into the Beis HaElohim the things that Aviv had dedicated as kodesh, and that he himself had dedicated as kodesh, kesef, and zahav, and kelim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,15,19,And there was no more milchamah unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,16,1,"In the six and thirtieth year Malchut Asa (of the reign of Asa) Ba'asha Melech Yisroel went up against Yehudah, and fortified Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to the territory of Asa Melech Yehudah."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,16,2,"Then Asa brought out kesef and zahav out of the otzarot of the Beis Hashem and of the Bais HaMelech, and sent to Ben-Hadad Melech Aram (Syria) , the one ruling in Damascus, saying,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,16,3,"There is a brit between me and thee, as there was between Avi and Avicha. Hinei, I have sent thee kesef and zahav; come, break thy brit with Ba'asha Melech Yisroel, that he may withdraw from me."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,16,4,"And Ben-Hadad paid heed unto HaMelech Asa, and sent the officers of his forces against the cities of Yisroel, and they struck down Iyon, and Dan, and Abel-Mayim, and all the storage cities of Naphtali."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,16,5,"And it came to pass, when Ba'asha heard it, that he left off building of Ramah, and let his work cease."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,16,6,"Then Asa HaMelech took all Yehudah, and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Ba'asha was building; and he built therewith Geva and Mitzpah."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,16,7,"And at that time Chanani HaRo'eh came to Asa Melech Yehudah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on Melech Aram, and not relied on Hashem Eloheicha, therefore is the army of Melech Aram escaped out of thine yad."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,16,8,"Were not the Cushim and the Luvim a huge army, with very many chariots and parashim? Yet, because thou didst rely on Hashem , He delivered them into thine yad."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,16,9,"For the eyes of Hashem run to and fro kol HaAretz, to strengthen them whose lev is shalem (wholehearted) toward Him. Herein thou hast done foolishly; therefore from henceforth thou shalt have milchamot."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,16,10,"Then Asa was wroth with the ro'eh, put him in a prison house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of HaAm at the same time."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,16,11,"And, hinei, the acts of Asa, harishonim and ha'acharonim, see, they are written in the Sefer HaMelachim Yehudah and Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,16,12,"And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his malchut (reign) became diseased in his raglayim, until his disease was exceedingly great. Yet even in his disease he sought not Hashem , but only the rofe'im."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,16,13,"And Asa slept with his Avotav, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,16,14,"And they buried him in his own kever (sepulchre, burial cave) , which he had cut for himself in Ir Dovid, and laid him on a mishkav (bed) which was filled with sweet spices and perfumes prepared by the apothecaries art; and they burned for him a very large serefah gedolah (great fire, pyre)."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,17,1,"And Yehoshaphat bno reigned in his place, and strengthened himself against Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,17,2,"And he placed troops in all the fortified cities of Yehudah, and set netzivim (garrisons) in Eretz Yehudah, and in the towns of Ephrayim, which Asa Aviv had captured."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,17,3,"And Hashem was with Yehoshaphat, because he walked in the darkhei Dovid Aviv harishonim, and sought not unto Ba'alim;"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,17,4,"But sought Hashem Elohei Aviv, and walked in His mitzvot, and not after the ma'asei Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,17,5,Therefore Hashem established the Mamlachah in his yad; and all Yehudah brought to Yehoshaphat minchah; and he had osher and kavod in abundance.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,17,6,And his lev was elevated in the darkhei Hashem ; moreover he removed the high places and Asherim from Yehudah.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,17,7,"Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his sarim (officials) , even to Ben-Chayil, and to Ovadyah, and to Zecharyah, and to Netanel, and to Michayah, to teach in the cities of Yehudah."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,17,8,"And with them he sent Levi'im, even Shema'yahu, and Netanyahu, and Zevadyahu, and Asahel, and Shemiramot, and Yehonatan, and Adoniyahu, and Toviyahu, and Tov Adoniyah, Levi'im; and with them Elishama and Yehoram, Kohanim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,17,9,"And they taught in Yehudah, and had with them the Sefer Torat Hashem , and went about throughout all the cities of Yehudah, and taught HaAm."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,17,10,"And the Pachad Hashem fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were surrounding Yehudah, so that they made no war against Yehoshaphat."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,17,11,"Also some of the Pelishtim (Philistines) brought Yehoshaphat minchah, and kesef massa (tribute) ; and the Arabs brought him tzon, seven thousand seven hundred rams, and seven thousand seven hundred goats."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,17,12,And Yehoshaphat grew great exceedingly; and he built in Yehudah fortresses and storage cities.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,17,13,"And he had melachah rabbah in the cities of Yehudah; and the anshei milchamah, gibborei chayil were in Yerushalayim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,17,14,"And these are the pekuddah (enrollment numbers) of them according to the Bais Avoteihem: of Yehudah, the sarei alafim; Adnah HaSar, and with him gibborei chayil three hundred elef."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,17,15,"And next to him was Yehochanan HaSar, and with him two hundred and fourscore elef."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,17,16,"And next to him was Amasyah ben Zichri, who volunteered unto Hashem , and with him two hundred elef gibbor chayil."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,17,17,"And from Binyamin, Elyada a gibbor chayil, and with him armed men with keshet and mogen two hundred elef."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,17,18,"And next to him was Yehozavad, and with him a hundred and fourscore elef battle-ready."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,17,19,"These waited on HaMelech, beside those whom HaMelech put in the fortified cities throughout all Yehudah."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,18,1,"Now Yehoshaphat had osher and kavod in abundance, and allied himself with Ach'av."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,18,2,"And l'ketz shanim he went down to Ach'av in Shomron. And Ach'av killed tzon and bakar for him in abundance, and for HaAm that he had with him, and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramot Gil'ad."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,18,3,"And Ach'av Melech Yisroel said unto Yehoshaphat Melech Yehudah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramot Gil'ad? And he answered him, I am as thou art, and my people as thy people; and we will be with thee in the milchamah."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,18,4,"And Yehoshaphat said unto the Melech Yisroel, Inquire, now at the Devar Hashem today."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,18,5,"Therefore the Melech Yisroel gathered together of nevi'im four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to war against Ramot Gil'ad, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for HaElohim will deliver it into the yad HaMelech."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,18,6,"But Yehoshaphat said, Is there not here a navi of Hashem , that we might inquire of him?"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,18,7,"And the Melech Yisroel said unto Yehoshaphat, There is yet ish echad (one man) , by whom we may inquire of Hashem , but I hate him because he never prophesied for tov about me, but always ra'ah; the same is Mikhay'hu ben Yimlach. And Yehoshaphat said, HaMelech should not say that."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,18,8,"And the Melech Yisroel called for one of his officials, and said, Bring at once Mikhay'hu ben Yimlach."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,18,9,"And the Melech Yisroel and Yehoshaphat Melech Yehudah sat either of them on his kisse, clothed in their begadim, and they sat in the goren (threshing floor) at the petach (entrance) Sha'ar Shomron; and all the nevi'im prophesied before them."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,18,10,"And Tzidkiyahu ben Kena'anah had made him karnayim of barzel, and said, Thus saith Hashem , With these thou shalt gore Aram (Syria) until they be consumed."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,18,11,"And all the nevi'im prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramot Gil'ad, and be victorious, for Hashem shall deliver it into the yad HaMelech."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,18,12,"And the malach that went to call Mikhay'hu spoke to him, saying, Hinei, the divrei hanevi'im declare tov to HaMelech with peh echad (one mouth) ; let thy word therefore, now, be like one of theirs, and speak thou tov."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,18,13,"And Mikhay'hu said, As Hashem liveth, only what Elohai saith, that will I speak."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,18,14,"And when he was come to HaMelech, HaMelech said unto him, Michah, shall we go to war against Ramot Gil'ad, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and be victorious, and they shall be delivered into your yad."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,18,15,"And HaMelech said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the emes to me in the Shem of Hashem?"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,18,16,"Then he said, I saw kol Yisroel scattered upon the mountains, like tzon that have no ro'eh, and Hashem said, These have no adonim; let them return therefore every ish to his bais in shalom."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,18,17,"And the Melech Yisroel said to Yehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy tov unto me, but rah?"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,18,18,"Again he said, Therefore hear the Devar Hashem : I saw Hashem sitting upon His Kisse, and all Tzva HaShomayim standing on his right and on his left."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,18,19,"And Hashem said, Who shall entice Ach'av Melech Yisroel, that he may go up and fall at Ramot Gil'ad? And one spoke saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,18,20,"Then there came out a ruach, and stood before Hashem , and said, I will entice him. And Hashem said unto him, How?"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,18,21,"And he said, I will go out, and be a ruach sheker (lying spirit) in the mouth of all his nevi'im. And Hashem said, Thou shalt entice him, and thou shalt also succeed; go out, and do even so."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,18,22,"Now therefore, hinei, Hashem hath put a ruach sheker in the mouth of these thy nevi'im, and Hashem hath decreed ra'ah against thee."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,18,23,"Then Tzidkiyahu ben Kena'anah came near, and struck Mikhay'hu upon the lechi (cheek) , and said, Which way went the Ruach Hashem from me to speak unto thee?"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,18,24,"And Mikhay'hu said, Thou shalt find out on that yom when thou shalt go into cheder b'cheder (inner chamber) to hide thyself."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,18,25,"Then the Melech Yisroel said, Take ye Mikhay'hu, and carry him back to Amon Sar HaIr, and to Yoash ben HaMelech,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,18,26,"And say, Thus saith HaMelech, Put this in the bais hakeleh, and feed him with only a scanty prison diet of lechem and only mayim, until I return b'shalom."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,18,27,"And Mikhay'hu said, If thou certainly return in shalom, then hath not Hashem spoken by me. And he said, Mark words, all ye people."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,18,28,So the Melech Yisroel and Yehoshaphat Melech Yehudah went up to Ramot Gil'ad.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,18,29,"And the Melech Yisroel said unto Yehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and I will go to the milchamah; but put thou on thy robes. So the Melech Yisroel disguised himself; and they went to the milchamah."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,18,30,"Now Melech Aram had commanded the commanders of the chariots that were with him, saying, Fight ye not with katon or gadol, only with the Melech Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,18,31,"And it came to pass, when the commanders of the chariots saw Yehoshaphat, that they said, It is the Melech Yisroel. Therefore they surrounded him to fight, but Yehoshaphat cried out, and Hashem helped him; and Elohim moved them away from him."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,18,32,"For it came to pass, that, when the commanders of the chariots perceived that it was not Melech Yisroel, they turned back from pursuing him."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,18,33,"And an ish drew a keshet at random, and struck Melech Yisroel between the devakim (joints) of the shiryon (armor) ; therefore he said to his chariot driver, Turn thine yad, that thou mayest take me out of the machaneh, for I am wounded."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,18,34,And the milchamah increased that day. Howbeit the Melech Yisroel propped himself up in his merkavah facing Aram (the Syrians) until the erev; and about the time of the shemesh going down he died.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,19,1,And Yehoshaphat Melech Yehudah returned to his Bais (Palace) in shalom in Yerushalayim.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,19,2,"And Yehu ben Chanani HaChozer (the Seer) went out to meet him, and said to HaMelech Yehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the rasha, and love them that hate Hashem ? Therefore ketzef (wrath) is upon thee from before Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,19,3,"Nevertheless there are devarim tovim (good things) found in thee, in that thou hast removed HaAsherot from HaAretz, and hast prepared thine lev to seek HaElohim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,19,4,"And Yehoshaphat dwelt in Yerushalayim; and he went out again among HaAm from Be'er-Sheva to Mt Ephrayim, and he turned them back unto Hashem Elohei Avoteihem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,19,5,"And he appointed Shofetim in HaAretz throughout all the fortified cities of Yehudah, city by city,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,19,6,"And said to the Shofetim, Take heed what ye do, for ye judge not for adam, but for Hashem , Who is with you in the devar mishpat (verdict)."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,19,7,"Wherefore now let the Pachad Hashem be upon you; be shomer and do it, for there is no avlah (injustice) with Hashem Eloheinu, nor massa panim (respect of persons) , nor mikkach shochad (taking of bribes)."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,19,8,"Moreover in Yerushalayim did Yehoshaphat station Levi'im, and Kohanim, and Rashei HaAvot Yisroel, for the Mishpat Hashem , and for riv (disputes) , and they returned to Yerushalayim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,19,9,"And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the yirat Hashem , be'emunah and with a levav shalem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,19,10,"And what riv soever shall come before you of your achim that dwell in your cities, between dahm and dahm, between torah and mitzvah, chukkot and mishpatim, ye shall even warn them that they trespass not against Hashem , and so ketzef (wrath) come upon you, and upon your achim; this do, and ye shall not trespass."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,19,11,"And, hinei, Amaryahu Kohen HaRosh is over you in all matters of Hashem ; and Zevadyahu ben Yishmael, the Nagid of the Bais Yehudah, for all the matters of HaMelech; also the Levi'im shall be shoterim (officers) before you. Deal courageously, and Hashem be with hatov."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,20,1,"It came to pass after this also, that the Bnei Moav, and the Bnei Ammon, and with them some Ammonim, came against Yehoshaphat to make milchamah."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,20,2,"Then there came some that told Yehoshaphat, saying, There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the Yam (Dead Sea) , from Aram; and, hinei, they are in Chatzetzon-Tamar, which is Ein-Gedi."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,20,3,"And Yehoshaphat feared, and set his face to inquire of Hashem , and proclaimed a tzom throughout all Yehudah."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,20,4,"And Yehudah gathered themselves together, to ask help of Hashem , even from all the towns of Yehudah they came to seek help of Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,20,5,"And Yehoshaphat stood in the Kehal Yehudah and Yerushalayim, in the Beis Hashem , before the khatzer hachadashah,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,20,6,"And he said, Hashem Elohei Avoteinu, art not Thou Elohim in Shomayim? And moshel (rulest) not Thou over kol mamlechot haGoyim? And in Thine yad is there not ko'ach and gevurah, so that none is able to withstand thee?"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,20,7,"Art not Thou Eloheinu, Who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before Thy people Yisroel, and gavest it to the Zera Avraham ohav'cha l'olam (Thy friend forever)?"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,20,8,"And they dwelt therein, and have built Thee a Mikdash therein for Thy Shem, saying,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,20,9,"If, when ra'ah cometh upon us, as the cherev, shefot, or dever, or ra'av (famine) , we stand before HaBeis HaZeh, and in Thy presence, (for Thy Shem is in HaBeis HaZeh,) and cry unto Thee in tzarateinu (our affliction) , then Thou wilt hear and save."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,20,10,"And now, hinei, the Bnei Ammon and Moav and Mt Se'ir, whom Thou wouldest not let Yisroel invade, when they came out of Eretz Mitzrayim, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,20,11,"Hinei, what gomelim (ones repaying) they are to us, to come to drive us out of Thy yerushah (inheritance) , which Thou hast given us."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,20,12,"O Eloheinu, wilt Thou not judge them? For we have no ko'ach against this great multitude that cometh against us; neither know we what to do, but our eyes are upon Thee."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,20,13,"And all Yehudah stood before Hashem , with their little ones, their nashim, and their banim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,20,14,"Then upon Yachaziel ben Zecharyahu ben Benayah ben Ye'iel ben Matanyah, a Levi of the Bnei Asaph, came the Ruach Hashem in the midst of the Kahal,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,20,15,"And he said, Pay heed ye, all Yehudah, and ye inhabitants of Yerushalayim, and thou Melech Yehoshaphat. Thus saith Hashem unto you: Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the milchamah is not yours, but that of Elohim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,20,16,"Makhar (tomorrow) go ye down against them; hinei, they come up by the Ascent of Tzitz; and ye shall find them at the end of the wadi, before the midbar of Yeruel."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,20,17,"Ye shall not need to fight in this; take up your battle positions, stand ye firm, and see the Yeshu'at Hashem with you, O Yehudah and Yerushalayim. Fear not, nor be dismayed; makhar (tomorrow) go out against them, for Hashem will be with you."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,20,18,"And Yehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground; and all Yehudah and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim fell down before Hashem , worshiping Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,20,19,"And the Levi'im, of the Bnei HaKehatim, and of the Bnei HaKorchim, stood up to praise Hashem Elohei Yisroel with an exceeding kol gadol."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,20,20,"And they rose early in the boker, and went forth into the Midbar Tekoa; and as they went forth, Yehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Yehudah, and ye inhabitants of Yerushalayim. Ha'aminu Ba Hashem Eloheichem (Believe in Hashem Eloheichem) , so shall ye be established; have faith in His Nevi'im, so shall ye be victorious."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,20,21,"And when he had consulted with HaAm, he appointed meshorarim (singers) unto Hashem , and that should praise the hadrat kodesh, as they went out before the army, and to say, Hodu L'Adonoi ki l'olam chasdo (Give thanks to Hashem , for His mercy endureth forever)."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,20,22,"And when they began with rinnah and tehillah, Hashem set me'arevim (ambushers) against the Bnei Ammon, Moav, and Mt Se'ir, which were come against Yehudah, and they were struck down."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,20,23,"For the Bnei Ammon and Moav stood up against the inhabitants of Mt Se'ir, utterly to slay and destroy them. And when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Se'ir, every one helped to destroy another."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,20,24,"And when Yehudah came toward the mitzpeh (guard tower) in the midbar, they looked toward the multitude, and, hinei, they were pegarim (corpses) fallen on the ground, and there was no escapee."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,20,25,"And when Yehoshaphat and his people came to carry off the plunder of them, they found among them in abundance both property with the pegarim, and articles of value, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away, and they were yamim shelosha in gathering of the plunder, it was so much."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,20,26,"And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the Berakhah Valley, for there they blessed Hashem ; therefore the shem of that place was called, the Berakhah Valley unto this day."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,20,27,"Then they returned, kol ish Yehudah and Yerushalayim, and Yehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Yerushalayim with simcha; for Hashem had made them to rejoice over their enemies."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,20,28,And they came to Yerushalayim with nevalim and kinnorot and khatzotzerot unto the Beis Hashem.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,20,29,"And the Pachad Elohim was on all the kingdoms of those lands, when they had heard that Hashem fought against the oyevei Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,20,30,"So the Malchut Yehoshaphat was at peace, for Elohav gave him rest on every side."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,20,31,"And Yehoshaphat reigned over Yehudah. He was thirty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and five years in Yerushalayim. And shem immo was Azuvah bat Shilchi."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,20,32,"And he walked in the derech Aviv Asa, and departed not from it, doing that which was yashar in the sight of Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,20,33,Howbeit the high places were not removed; for HaAm as yet had not set their hearts unto Elohei Avoteihem.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,20,34,"Now the rest of the acts of Yehoshaphat, harishonim and ha'acharonim, hinei, they are written in the Annals of Yehu ben Chanani, who is recorded in the Sefer of the Melachim of Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,20,35,"And after this did Yehoshaphat Melech Yehudah join himself in alliance with Achazyah Melech Yisroel, who did very wickedly;"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,20,36,"And he joined himself with him to make oniyot (ships) to go to Tarshish, and they made the oniyot in Etzyon-Gever."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,20,37,"Then Eli'ezer ben Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Yehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself in alliance with Achazyahu, Hashem hath wrecked thy ma'asim. And the oniyot were wrecked, that they were not able to sail to Tarshish."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,21,1,"Now Yehoshaphat slept with his avot, and was buried with his avot in Ir Dovid. And Yehoram bno reigned in his place."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,21,2,"And he had achim, the Bnei Yehoshaphat, Azaryah, and Yechiel, and Zecharyahu, and Azaryahu, and Micha'el, and Shephatyahu. All these were the Bnei Yehoshaphat Melech Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,21,3,"And their av have given them mattanot rabbot of kesef, and of zahav, and of precious things, with fortified cities in Yehudah, but the Mamlachah (Kingdom) he gave to Yehoram; because he was the bechor."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,21,4,"Now when Yehoram was risen up to the Mamlachah of his av, he strengthened himself, and slaughtered all his achim with the cherev, and also a number of the sarim (leading political figures) of Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,21,5,"Yehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned shemoneh shanim in Yerushalayim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,21,6,"And he walked in the derech of the melachim of Yisroel, as did the Bais Ach'av, for he had the Bat Ach'av to wife, and he wrought that which was rah in the eyes of Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,21,7,"However, Hashem was not willing to destroy the Bais Dovid, for the sake of HaBrit that He had cut with Dovid, and since He promised to give a ner (lamp) to him and to his banim kol hayamim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,21,8,"In the days of Yehoram, Edom rebelled from under the yad Yehudah, and made themselves a melech."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,21,9,"Then Yehoram went forth with his sarim (princes) , and all his chariots with him, and he rose up by lailah, and struck down Edom which had surrounded him, and the commanders of the chariots."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,21,10,"So the Edomites rebelled from under the yad Yehudah unto this day. At the same time also did Livnah rebel from under his yad, because he had forsaken Hashem Elohei Avotav."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,21,11,"Moreover he built high places in the mountains of Yehudah and caused the inhabitants of Yerushalayim to commit fornication, and led Yehudah astray."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,21,12,"And there came a miktav (letter) to him from Eliyahu HaNavi, saying, Thus saith Hashem Elohei Dovid Avicha, Because thou hast not walked in the darkhei Yehoshaphat Avicha, nor in the darkhei Asa Melech Yehudah,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,21,13,"But hast walked in the derech of the melachim of Yisroel, and hast made Yehudah and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim to go a-whoring, like the whoredoms of the Bais Ach'av, and also hast murdered thy achim of Bais Avicha, which were better than thee;"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,21,14,"Hinei, with a maggefah gedolah (great plague) will Hashem strike thy people, and thy banim, and thy nashim, and all thy possessions;"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,21,15,"And thou shalt have cholayim rabbim with machla (disease) of thy bowels, until thy bowels come out by reason of the choli yamim al yamim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,21,16,"Moreover Hashem stirred up against Yehoram the ruach HaPelishtim, and of the Arabs, who lived near the Cushim;"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,21,17,"And they came up against Yehudah, and invaded, and carried away all the possessions that were found in the Bais HaMelech, and also his banim, and his nashim; so that there was left him not a ben except Yehoachaz (Achazyahu, Ahaziah) , the youngest of his banim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,21,18,And after all this Hashem struck him in his bowels with a choli for which there was no marpeh.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,21,19,"And it came to pass that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels protruded out by reason of his choli; so he died in great pain. And his people kindled no pyre in his honor, as they had done for his avot."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,21,20,"Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Yerushalayim shemoneh shanim, and departed without chemdah (desire [for him]) . Howbeit they buried him in the Ir Dovid, but not in the kevarot hamelachim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,22,1,And the inhabitants of Yerushalayim made Achazyahu (Ahaziah of Judah) his youngest son melech in his place; for the troops that came with the Arabs into the machaneh had slain all the eldest. So Achazyahu (Ahaziah) ben Yehoram Melech Yehudah reigned.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,22,2,"Twenty and two years old was Achazyahu (Ahaziah) when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Yerushalayim And shem immo was Atalyah bat Omri."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,22,3,He also walked in the darkhei Bais Ach'av (Ahab) ; for immo (his mother) was his counselor to do rah.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,22,4,Therefore he did rah in the eyes of Hashem like the Bais Ach'av (House of Ahab) ; for they were his yo'atzim (counselors) after the mot (death) of his av to his ruin.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,22,5,"He walked also after their etza (advice, counsel) , and went with Yehoram ben Ach'av Melech Yisroel to war against Chazael Melech Aram (Syria) at Ramot Gil'ad; and the Syrians wounded Yoram."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,22,6,"And he (Yehoram) returned to Yizre'el (Jezreel) to recover from his wounds which were inflicted upon him at Ramah, when he fought with Chazael Melech Aram. And Achazyahu (Ahaziah) ben Yehoram Melech Yehudah went down to see Yehoram ben Ach'av at Yizre'el (Jezreel) , because he was wounded."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,22,7,"And the tevusat Achazyahu (downfall of Ahaziah) was of Elohim in coming to Yoram, for when he arrived, he went out with Yehoram against Yehu ben Nimshi, whom Hashem had anointed to cut off the Bais Ach'av (the House of Ahab)."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,22,8,"And it came to pass, that, when Yehu was executing mishpat upon the Bais Ach'av, and found the sarei Yehudah, and the bnei achei Achazyahu that were in attendance with Achazyahu, he slaughtered them."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,22,9,"And he searched for Achazyahu, and they captured him while he was hiding in Shomron (Samaria) , and brought him to Yehu; and when they had slain him, they buried him. Because, they said, he is a ben Yehoshaphat, who sought Hashem with all his levav. So the Bais Achazyahu had no koach to retain the mamlachah (kingdom)."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,22,10,"But when Atalyah em Achazyahu saw that her son was dead, she arose and began destroying kol zera hamamlachah (all the royal seed) of the Bais Yehudah."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,22,11,"But Yehoshavat Bat HaMelech, took Yoash ben Achazyahu, and stole him away from among the Bnei HaMelech that were being murdered, and put him and his nurse in a cheder hamittot (bedroom) . So Yehoshavat Bat HaMelech Yehoram, the isha of Yehoyada HaKohen, (for she was the achot of Achazyahu) , hid him from Atalyah, so that she slaughtered him not."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,22,12,And he was with them hid in the Bais Elohim shesh shanim. And Atalyah reigned over HaAretz.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,23,1,"And in the seventh year Yehoyada strengthened himself, and took the commanders of hundreds, Azaryah ben Yerocham, and Yishmael ben Yehochanan, and Azaryahu ben Oved, and Ma'aseiyahu ben Adayahu, and Elishaphat ben Zichri, into brit with him."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,23,2,"And they went about in Yehudah, and gathered the Levi'im out of all the towns of Yehudah, and the Rashei HaAvot of Yisroel, and they came to Yerushalayim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,23,3,"And Kol HaKahal made a brit with HaMelech in the Beis Elohim. And he said unto them, Hinei, the Ben HaMelech shall reign, just as Hashem hath said of the Bnei Dovid."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,23,4,"This is the thing that ye shall do: A third part of you coming on duty on Shabbos, of the Kohanim and of the Levi'im, shall keep watch at the doors;"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,23,5,And a third part shall be at the Bais HaMelech; and a third part at the Sha'ar HaYesod; and Kol HaAm shall be in the Khatzerot of the Beis Hashem.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,23,6,"But let none enter into the Beis Hashem , except the Kohanim, and the ministering Levi'im; they shall go in, for they are kodesh; but Kol HaAm shall be shomer over the mishmeret Hashem (the instructions of Hashem)."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,23,7,"And the Levi'im shall surround HaMelech, every ish with his weapon in his yad; and whosoever else cometh into the Beis, he shall be put to death, but be ye with HaMelech when he cometh in, and when he goeth out."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,23,8,"So the Levi'im and all Yehudah did according to all things that Yehoyada HaKohen had commanded, and took every ish his men that were to go on duty on Shabbos, with them that were to go off duty on Shabbos; for Yehoyada HaKohen dismissed not the machlekot."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,23,9,"Moreover Yehoyada HaKohen delivered to the commanders of hundreds spears, and large shields, and small shields, that had belonged to Dovid HaMelech, which were in the Beis Elohim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,23,10,"And he stationed kol haAm for a guard around HaMelech, every ish having his weapon in his yad, from the right side of the Beis to the left side of the Beis, near the Mizbe'ach and Beis."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,23,11,"Then they brought out the Ben HaMelech, and put upon him the nezer, and gave him the Edut, and proclaimed him Melech. And Yehoyada and his banim anointed him, and shouted, Yechi HaMelech!"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,23,12,"Now when Atalyah heard the noise of HaAm running and cheering HaMelech, she came to HaAm into the Beis Hashem,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,23,13,"And she looked, and, hinei, HaMelech stood at his ammud at the entrance, and the sarim and the khatzotzerot (trumpeters) beside HaMelech; and Kol HaAm HaAretz same'ach (rejoiced) , and sounded the khatzotzerot, also the meshorarim with instruments of music, and the praise leaders. Then Atalyah tore her robe, shouted, Kesher, Kesher!"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,23,14,"Then Yehoyada HaKohen brought out the commanders of hundreds that were set over the army, and said unto them, Bring her out between the sederot (ranks) ; and whosoever followeth her, let him be put to death with the cherev. For the Kohen said, Do not put her to death in the Beis Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,23,15,"So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entrance of the Sha'ar HaSusim by the Beis HaMelech, they put her to death there."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,23,16,"And Yehoyada made a brit between him, and between Kol HaAm, and between HaMelech, that they should be Am La Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,23,17,"Then kol HaAm went to the Beis HaBa'al, and tore it down, and broke in pieces its mizbechot and its tzelem, and slaughtered Mattan Kohen HaBaal in front of the mizbechot."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,23,18,"Also Yehoyada assigned the Pekudot of the Beis Hashem by the yad of the Kohanim the Levi'im, whom Dovid had assigned in the Beis Hashem , to offer olot Hashem , as it is written in the Torat Moshe, with simcha and with shir, as it was ordained by Dovid."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,23,19,"And he set the Sho'arim at the Sha'arei Beis Hashem , that none tamei in any thing should enter in."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,23,20,"And he took the commanders of hundreds, and the nobles, and the moshelim of HaAm, and Kol HaAm HaAretz, and brought down HaMelech from the Beis Hashem ; and they came through the Sha'ar HaElyon into the Beis HaMelech, and seated HaMelech upon the Kisse HaMamlachah."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,23,21,And kol Am HaAretz rejoiced; and the Ir was quiet after that they had put to death Atalyah with the cherev.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,24,1,"Yoash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned arba'im shanah in Yerushalayim. Shem immo also was Tzivyah of Be'er-Sheva."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,24,2,And Yoash did that which was yashar in the eyes of Hashem kol yemei Yehoyada HaKohen.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,24,3,And Yehoyada took for him nashim shtayim; and he fathered banim and banot.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,24,4,"And it came to pass after this, that Yoash was minded to renovate the Bais Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,24,5,"And he called together the Kohanim and the Levi'im, and said to them, Go out unto the towns of Yehudah, and collect from Kol Yisroel kesef to repair the Bais Eloheichem annually, and see that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levi'im hastened it not."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,24,6,"And HaMelech called for Yehoyada HaRosh, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levi'im to bring in from Yehudah and from Yerushalayim the mas'at (the tax of) Moshe Eved Hashem and the Kahal L'Yisroel L'Ohel HaEdut?"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,24,7,For the sons of that wicked woman Atalyah had broken in the Beis HaElohim; all the Kadshei Beis Hashem did they bestow upon Ba'alim.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,24,8,And at the commandment of HaMelech they made aron echad and set it outside at the Sha'ar Beis Hashem.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,24,9,"And they made a proclamation in Yehudah and in Yerushalayim, to bring in to Hashem the mas'at Moshe Eved HaElohim laid upon Yisroel in the midbar."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,24,10,"And all the sarim and kol HaAm rejoiced, and brought in, and dropped into the aron, until it was full."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,24,11,"Now it came to pass, that at what time the aron was brought unto the Pekuddat HaMelech by the yad of the Levi'im, and when they saw that there was much kesef, the Sofer HaMelech and the official, the Pakid Kohen HaRosh came and emptied the aron, and took it, and carried it to its place again. Thus they did yom b'yom, and collected kesef in abundance."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,24,12,"And HaMelech and Yehoyada gave it to such as did the work of the Avodas Beis Hashem , and hired masons and carpenters to renovate the Beis Hashem , and also such as wrought barzel and nechoshet to repair the Beis Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,24,13,"So the workmen wrought, and the work in the yad of them was furthered, and they restored the Beis HaElohim to its original form and reinforced it."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,24,14,"And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the kesef before HaMelech and Yehoyada, whereof were made vessels for the Beis Hashem , even keli sharet, and for the olot, and ladles, and vessels of zahav and kesef. And they offered olot in the Beis Hashem continually all the days of Yehoyada."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,24,15,"But Yehoyada was old, and was full of yamim when he died: 130 years old was he in his mot."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,24,16,"And they buried him in Ir Dovid among the Melachim, because he had done tovah in Yisroel, both toward HaElohim, and His Beis."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,24,17,"Now after the mot Yehoyada came the sarim of Yehudah, and paid homage to HaMelech. Then HaMelech paid heed unto them."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,24,18,"And they forsook the Beis Hashem Elohei Avoteihem, and served HaAsherim and the atzabim; and ketzef (wrath) came upon Yehudah and Yerushalayim because of their trespass."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,24,19,"Yet He sent Nevi'im to them, to bring them back unto Hashem ; and they testified against them; but they would not give ear."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,24,20,"And the Ruach Elohim came upon Zecharyah ben Yehoyada HaKohen, which stood before HaAm and he said unto them, Thus saith HaElohim, Why transgress ye the mitzvot Hashem , that ye cannot prosper? Because ye have forsook Hashem , He hath also forsaken you."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,24,21,"And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the order of HaMelech in the khatzer of the Beis Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,24,22,"Thus Yoash HaMelech remembered not the chesed which Yehoyada Aviv had done to him, but slaughtered bno. And when he died, he said, May Hashem look upon it, and may He call to account."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,24,23,"And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the army of Aram came up against him, they invaded Yehudah and Yerushalayim, destroyed all the sarim of the people from among HaAm, sent all their plunder unto Melech Darmesek (Damascus)."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,24,24,"For the army of Aram came with a small company of men, and Hashem delivered a very great army into their yad, because they had forsaken Hashem Elohei Avoteihem. So they executed shefatim against Yoash."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,24,25,"And when they withdrew from him, (for they left him with machaluyim rabbim ), his own avadim conspired against him on account of the dahm of the Bnei Yehoyada HaKohen, and slaughtered him on his bed, and he died; and they buried him in Ir Dovid, but they buried him not in the Kivrot HaMelachim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,24,26,"And these are they that conspired against him: Zavad ben Shim'at an Ammonit, and Yehozavad ben Shimrit the Moavit."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,24,27,"Now concerning his banim, and the rav hamassa concerning him, and the repairing of the Beis HaElohim, hinei, they are written in the Midrash Sefer HaMelachim. And Amatzyah bno reigned in his place."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,25,1,"Amatzyah was 25 old when he began to reign, and he reigned 29 shanah in Yerushalayim. And shem immo was Yeho'addin of Yerushalayim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,25,2,"And he did that which was yashar in the eyes of Hashem , but not with a levav shalem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,25,3,"Now it came to pass, when the mamlachah was established under him, that he slaughtered his avadim that had murdered HaMelech Aviv."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,25,4,"But he slaughtered not their banim, but did as it is written in the Torah in the Sefer Moshe, where Hashem commanded, saying, The avot shall not die for the banim, neither shall the banim die for the avot, but every ish shall die for his own chet."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,25,5,"Moreover Amatzyahu gathered Yehudah together, and set them in order in Bais Avot by officers of thousands and officers of hundreds, throughout all Yehudah and Binyamin; and he mustered them from esrim shanah and above, and found them three hundred elef bachur, battle-ready choice men, that could handle spear and shield."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,25,6,He hired also a hundred elef gibbor chayil out of Yisroel for a hundred talents of kesef.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,25,7,"But there came an Ish HaElohim to him, saying, O HaMelech, let not the Tzeva Yisroel go with thee; for Hashem is not with Yisroel, not with kol Bnei Ephrayim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,25,8,"But if thou wilt go, do it; chazak (be strong) for the milchamah; HaElohim shall make thee fall before the enemy, for Elohim hath ko'ach to help, and to cast down."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,25,9,"And Amatzyahu said to the Ish HaElohim, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have paid for the army of Yisroel? And the Ish HaElohim answered, Hashem is able to give thee much more than this."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,25,10,"Then Amatzyahu separated them, the army that had come to him from Ephrayim, to go home again; therefore their anger was greatly kindled against Yehudah, and they returned home in chari af (great anger)."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,25,11,"And Amatzyahu strengthened himself, led forth his army, went to the Gey HaMelach, struck down 10,000 of the Bnei Se'ir."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,25,12,"And another 10,000 left chayyim (alive) did the Bnei Yehudah carry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the cliff, and cast them down from the top of the cliff, that they all were dashed to pieces."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,25,13,"But the soldiers of the army which Amatzyahu sent back, that they should not go with him to milchamah, fell upon the cities of Yehudah, from Shomron even unto Beit-Choron, and struck down three thousand of them, and took much plunder."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,25,14,"Now it came to pass, after that Amatzyahu returned from the slaughter of the people of Edom, that he brought the elohei Bnei Se'ir, and set them up for him to be elohim, and bowed down himself before them, and burned ketoret unto them."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,25,15,"Therefore the Af Hashem was kindled against Amatzyahu, and he sent unto him a navi, which said unto him, Why hast thou sought after the elohei haAm, which could not deliver their own people out of thine yad?"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,25,16,"And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that HaMelech said unto him, Art thou appointed the adviser to HaMelech? Forbear. Why shouldest thou be struck down? Then the navi forbore, and said, I know that Elohim hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not paid heed unto my etza (counsel)."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,25,17,"Then Amatzyahu Melech Yehudah consulted, and sent to Yoash ben Yehoachaz ben Yehu, Melech Yisroel, saying, Come, let us meet face to face."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,25,18,"And Yoash Melech Yisroel sent to Amatzyahu Melech Yehudah, saying, The thistle that was in the Levanon sent to the cedar that was in the Levanon, saying, Give thy bat to beni (my son) as isha; then there passed by a chayyat hasadeh (wild beast) that was in the Levanon, and trode down the thistle."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,25,19,"Thou sayest, Hinei, thou hast struck down the people of Edom; and thine lev lifteth thee up to be proud. Abide now at home. Why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Yehudah with thee?"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,25,20,"But Amatzyah would not hear, for it came from HaElohim, that He might deliver them into the yad of their enemies, because they sought after the elohei Edom."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,25,21,"So Yoash Melech Yisroel went up and they met face to face, both he and Amatzyahu Melech Yehudah, at Beit-Shemesh, which belongeth to Yehudah."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,25,22,"And Yehudah was routed before Yisroel, and they fled every ish to his ohel."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,25,23,"And Yoash Melech Yisroel captured Amatzyahu Melech Yehudah ben Yoash ben Yehoachaz, at Beit-Shemesh, and brought him to Yerushalayim, and broke down the Chomat Yerushalayim from the Sha'ar Ephrayim to the Sha'ar HaPinnah, a section the length of which was four hundred cubits."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,25,24,"And he took all the zahav and the kesef, and all the vessels that were found in the Beis HaElohim with Oved-Edom, and the otzerot Bais HaMelech, the hostages also, and returned to Shomron."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,25,25,And Amatzyahu ben Yoash Melech Yehudah lived after the mot Yoash ben Yehoachaz Melech Yisroel fifteen years.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,25,26,"Now the rest of the acts of Amatzyahu, harishonim and ha'acharonim, hinei, are they not written in the Sefer of the Melachim of Yehudah and Yisroel?"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,25,27,"Now after the time that Amatzyah did turn away from following Hashem they made a kesher against him in Yerushalayim; and he fled to Lakhish, but they sent to Lakhish after him, and slaughtered him there."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,25,28,"And they brought him upon susim, and buried him with Avotav in Ir Yehudah."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,26,1,"Then kol HaAm Yehudah took Uziyahu, who was sixteen years old, and made him Melech in the place of Aviv Amatzyahu."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,26,2,"He built up Eilot, and restored it to Yehudah, after that HaMelech slept with Avotav."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,26,3,"Sixteen years old was Uziyahu when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and two shanah in Yerushalayim. Shem immo also was Yecholyah of Yerushalayim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,26,4,"And he did that which was yashar in the eyes of Hashem , according to all that Aviv Amatzyahu did."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,26,5,"And he sought Elohim in the days of Zecharyahu, who had understanding in the visions of HaElohim; and as long as he sought Hashem , HaElohim made him to have success."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,26,6,"And he went forth and warred against the Pelishtim (Philistines) , and broke down the chomat Gat, and the chomat Yavneh, and the chomat Ashdod, and built towns near Ashdod, and among the Pelishtim (Philistines)."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,26,7,"And HaElohim helped him against the Pelishtim (Philistines) , and against the Arabs that dwelt in Gur-Ba'al, and the Me'unim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,26,8,"And the Ammonim gave minchah to Uziyahu, and shmo spread abroad even to the approach to Mitzrayim; for he strengthened himself exceedingly."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,26,9,"Moreover Uziyahu built migdalim (towers) in Yerushalayim at the Sha'ar HaPinnah, and at the Sha'ar of the Gey, and at the Miktzo'a, and he fortified them."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,26,10,"Also he built migdalim in the midbar, and dug borot rabbim (many wells) , for he had much livestock, both in the Shefelah (Lowlands) , and in the Mishor (Plains, Level Country) ; ikkarim (field workers, farmers) also, and koremim (vineyard workers, vine-keepers) in the hills, and in the Carmel, for he loved adamah (the soil)."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,26,11,"Moreover Uziyahu had an army of fighting men that went out to tzava (battle) in troops, according to the number of their mustering by the yad Ye'iel the Sofer and Ma'aseiyahu the Shoter (Officer) , under the yad Chananyahu, one of the officials of HaMelech."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,26,12,The whole mispar (number) of the Rashei HaAvot over the mighty warriors were two thousand and six hundred.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,26,13,"And under their yad was a battle group, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, that made milchamah with mighty ko'ach, to help HaMelech against the enemy."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,26,14,"And Uziyahu prepared for them throughout all the army moginim (shields) , and spears, and helmets, and armor, and bows, and slingstones."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,26,15,"And he made in Yerushalayim machines designed by inventive engineers, for use on the migdalim and upon the corners of the city wall, to shoot khitzim (arrows) and avanim gedolot. And shmo spread far abroad, for he was marvellously helped, until when chazak (he became powerful)."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,26,16,"But when he became powerful, his lev was lifted up to his downfall, for he was unfaithful against Hashem Elohav, and he entered into the Heikhal Hashem to burn ketoret upon the Mizbe'ach HaKetoret."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,26,17,"And Azaryahu HaKohen went in after him, and with him shemonim Kohanim of Hashem , that were men of courage."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,26,18,"And they stood up against Uziyahu HaMelech, and said unto him, It is not for you, Uziyahu, to burn ketoret unto Hashem , but to the Kohanim the Bnei Aharon, that are hamekudashim (consecrated and ritually pure) to burn ketoret. Go out from the Mikdash, for thou hast been treacherous; neither shall it be for thine kavod (honor) from Hashem Elohim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,26,19,"Then Uziyahu became angry, and had a mikteret (censer) in his yad to burn ketoret, and while he was raging with the Kohanim, the tzara'at even broke out on his metzach (forehead) before the Kohanim in the Beis Hashem , near the Mizbe'ach HaKetoret."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,26,20,"And Azaryahu the Kohen HaRosh, and all the Kohanim, looked upon him, and, hinei, he was leprous on his metzach, and they thrust him out from there; yea, he himself hasted also to go out, because Hashem nun-gimmel-ayin-vav."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,26,21,"And Uziyahu HaMelech was metzorah (a leper) unto his yom mot, and dwelt in a leper asylum house, because of his leprosy; for he was nigzar from the Beis Hashem ; and Yotam bno was over the Bais HaMelech, governing the Am HaAretz."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,26,22,"Now the rest of the acts of Uziyah, harishonim and ha'acharonim, did Yeshayahu ben Amotz, HaNavi, record."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,26,23,"So Uziyahu slept with Avotav, and they buried him with Avotav in the sadeh hakevurah which belonged to the Melachim; for they said, He is a metzorah. And Yotam bno reigned in his place. Yotam was twenty and five shanah when he began to reign, and he was king sixteen shanah in Yerushalayim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,27,1,The shem immo also was Yerusha bat Tzadok.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,27,2,"And he did that which was yashar (right) in the eyes of Hashem , according to all that his av Uziyah did; howbeit he entered not into the Heikhal Hashem . And the people did corruptly still."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,27,3,"He built the upper sha'ar Beis Hashem , and on the chomat Ophel he built much."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,27,4,"Moreover he built towns in the har Yehudah, and in the forests he built fortresses and migdalim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,27,5,"He fought also with Melech Bnei Ammon, and prevailed against them. And the Bnei Ammon gave him the same year a hundred talents of kesef, and ten thousand measures of chittim (wheat) , and ten thousand of se'orim (barley) . The Bnei Ammon did pay this amount unto him, both the second year, and the third."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,27,6,"So Yotam became mighty, because he made the darkhei Yotam steadfast before Hashem Elohav."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,27,7,"Now the rest of the divrei Yotam, and all his milchamot, and his ways, lo, they are written in the sefer of the melachim of Yisroel and Yehudah."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,27,8,"He was five and twenty shanah when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen shanah in Yerushalayim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,27,9,"And Yotam slept with his avot, and they buried him in Ir Dovid; and Achaz bno reigned in his place."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,28,1,"Achaz was 20 when he began to reign, and he reigned 16 years in Yerushalayim; but he did not that which was yashar in the eyes of Hashem , like Dovid Aviv,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,28,2,"For he walked in the ways of the melachim of Yisroel, and made also massekhot for Ba'alim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,28,3,"Moreover he burned ketoret in the Gey Ben Hinnom, and burned his banim in the eish, after the to'avot of the Goyim whom Hashem had driven out before the Bnei Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,28,4,"He also sacrificed and burned ketoret on the high places, and on the hilltops, and under every green tree."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,28,5,"Therefore Hashem Elohav delivered him into the yad Melech Aram; and they defeated him, and carried off a great multitude of prisoners, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the yad Melech Yisroel, who inflicted on him makkah gedolah."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,28,6,"For Pekach ben Remalyahu slaughtered in Yehudah 120 elef in yom echad, which were all valiant men; because they had forsaken Hashem Elohei Avotam."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,28,7,"And Zichri, a gibbor of Ephrayim, slaughtered Ma'aseiyahu ben HaMelech, and Azrikam the Nagid HaBais, and Elkanah Mishneh HaMelech."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,28,8,"And the Bnei Yisroel carried away captive of their achim 200 elef nashim, banim, and banot, and took also away much plunder from them, and carried back the plunder to Shomron."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,28,9,"But a navi of Hashem was there shmo Oded, and he went out before the faces of the tzava returning to Shomron, and said unto them, Hinei, because Hashem Elohei Avoteichem was angry with Yehudah, He hath delivered them into your yad, and ye have slain them in a rage that reacheth up unto Shomayim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,28,10,"And now ye intend to keep under the Bnei Yehudah and Yerushalayim for avadim and shefachot unto you, but are there not with you, even with you, sins against Hashem Eloheichem?"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,28,11,"Now hear me therefore, and send back the prisoners, which ye have taken captive of your achim, for the Charon Af Hashem is upon you."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,28,12,"Then certain anashim of the Rashei Bnei Ephrayim, Azaryahu ben Yehochanan, Berechyahu ben Meshillemot, Yechizkiyahu ben Shallum, and Amasa ben Chadlai, stood up against them that came from the tzava,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,28,13,"And said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the prisoners here; for whereas we have offended against Hashem already, ye intend to add more to chattotenu and to ashmatenu, for our guilt is great, and there is Charon Af against Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,28,14,So the soldiers released the prisoners and the plunder before the sarim and kol HaKahal.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,28,15,"And the men which were designated by shemot rose up, and took the prisoners, and with the plunder clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and put balm on them, and carried all the weak of them upon donkeys, and brought them to Yericho, the Ir Temarim, to their achim. Then they returned to Shomron."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,28,16,At that time did HaMelech Achaz send unto the melachim of Assyria to help him.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,28,17,"For again the people of Edom had come and attacked Yehudah, and carried away prisoners."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,28,18,"The Pelishtim also had invaded the towns of the Shefelah, and of the Negev of Yehudah, and had taken Beit-Shemesh, Ayalon, Gederot, and Sokhoh with the villages thereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and the villages thereof, and they dwelt there."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,28,19,"For Hashem brought Yehudah low because of Achaz Melech Yisroel, for he brought disgrace to Yehudah, and acted treacherously against Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,28,20,"And Tilgat Pilneser Melech Ashur came unto him, and oppressed him, but helped him not."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,28,21,"For Achaz took away a portion out of the Beis Hashem , and out of the Bais HaMelech, and of the sarim, and gave it unto Melech Ashur, but he helped him not."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,28,22,And in the time of his distress he did act even more unfaithfully against Hashem . This is that Melech Achaz.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,28,23,"For he sacrificed unto the elohei Damascus, which defeated him, and he said, Because the elohim of the melachim of Syria help them, therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of kol Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,28,24,"And Achaz gathered together the vessels of the Beis HaElohim, and cut up the vessels of the Beis HaElohim and shut up the daletot Beis Hashem , and he set up for him mizbechot in every corner of Yerushalayim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,28,25,"And in every town in Yehudah he made high places to burn ketoret unto elohim acherim, and provoked to anger Hashem Elohei Avotav."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,28,26,"Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, the rishonim and the acharonim, hinei, they are written in the Sefer of the Melachim of Yehudah and Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,28,27,"And Achaz slept with Avotav, and they buried him in the city, even in Yerushalayim, but they brought him not into the keverim of the Melachim of Yisroel. And Chizkiyahu (Yechizkiyahu) bno reigned in his place."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,29,1,"Chizkiyahu (Yechizkiyahu) began to reign when he was 25 years old, and he reigned 29 years in Yerushalayim. And the shem immo was Aviyah bat Zecharyahu."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,29,2,"And he did that which was yashar in the eyes of Hashem , according to all that Dovid Aviv had done."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,29,3,"He in the first year of his reign, in the chodesh harishon, opened the daletot Beis Hashem , and repaired them."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,29,4,"And he brought in the Kohanim and the Levi'im, and gathered them together into the rechov hamizrach (eastern plaza),"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,29,5,"And said unto them, Hear me, ye Levi'im, set yourselves apart as kodesh now and consecrate the Beis Hashem Elohei Avoteichem, and remove the niddah (contamination) from HaKodesh."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,29,6,"For Avoteinu have been unfaithful, and have done that which is rah in the eyes of Hashem Eloheinu, have forsaken Him, have turned away their faces from the Mishkan Hashem , and to it they have turned their backs."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,29,7,"Also they have shut the daletot of the Ulam, and put out the nerot, and have not burned ketoret nor offered olah in HaKodesh unto Elohei Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,29,8,"Therefore the wrath of Hashem was upon Yehudah and Yerushalayim, and he hath caused them to be a horror and an object of scorn and hissing, as ye see with your eyes."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,29,9,"For, hinei, Avoteinu have fallen by the cherev, our banim, our banot, our nashim are in captivity for this."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,29,10,"Now it is in mine lev to make a Brit with Hashem Elohei Yisroel, that His fierce wrath may turn away from us."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,29,11,"My banim, be not now negligent, for Hashem hath chosen you to stand before Him, to serve Him, and that ye should minister unto Him, and burn ketoret."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,29,12,"Then the Levi'im arose: Machat ben Amasai, and Yoel ben Azaryahu, of the Bnei HaKehati; and of the Bnei Merari, Kish ben Avdi, Azaryahu ben Yehallelel; and, of the Gershoni, Yoach ben Zimmah, and Eden ben Yoach;"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,29,13,"And of the Bnei Elitzaphan, Shimri, and Ye'iel; and of the Bnei Asaph; Zecharyahu, and Matanyahu;"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,29,14,"And of the Bnei Heman, Yechiel, and Shime'i; and of the Bnei Yedutun, Shema'yah, and Uzziel."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,29,15,"And they gathered their achim, and set themselves apart as kodesh, and went in, according to the mitzvat HaMelech, by the words of Hashem , to make tahor the Beis Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,29,16,"And the Kohanim went into the penimah (inner part) Beis Hashem , to make it tahor, and brought out all tumah that they found in the Heikhal Hashem into the khatzer (courtyard) of the Beis Hashem . And the Levi'im took it, to carry it outside into the Wadi Kidron."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,29,17,"Now they began on the first day of the chodesh harishon to set apart as kodesh, and on the eighth day of the month they came to the Ulam Hashem ; so they set apart as kodesh the Beis Hashem in eight days; and in the sixteenth day of the first month they finished."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,29,18,"Then they went penimah to Chizkiyahu HaMelech, and said, We have made tahor all the Beis Hashem , and the Mizbe'ach HaOlah, with all the vessels thereof, and the Shulchan HaMa'arechet (Table of the Stacks of Showbread) , with all the vessels thereof."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,29,19,"Moreover all the kelim (vessels) , which HaMelech Achaz in his reign did remove in his unfaithfulness, have we prepared and set apart as kodesh, and, hinei, they are before the Mizbe'ach Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,29,20,"Then Chizkiyahu (Yechizkiyahu) HaMelech got up, and gathered the sarim of HaIr, and went up to the Beis Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,29,21,"And they brought seven bulls, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven male goats, for a chattat (sin offering) for the Mamlachah (Kingdom) , and for the Mikdash, and for Yehudah. And he commanded the Bnei Aharon HaKohanim to offer them on the Mizbe'ach Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,29,22,"So they slaughtered the bulls, and the kohanim received the dahm, and sprinkled it on the Mizbe'ach; likewise, when they had slaughtered the rams, they sprinkled the dahm upon the Mizbe'ach; they slaughtered also the lambs, and they sprinkled the dahm upon the Mizbe'ach."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,29,23,"And they brought forth the male goats for the chattat before HaMelech and HaKahal; and they laid their hands upon them,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,29,24,"And the Kohanim slaughtered them, and they made a sin offering with their dahm upon the Mizbe'ach, to make kapporah for kol Yisroel; for HaMelech commanded that the olah (burnt offering) and the (chattat) should be made for kol Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,29,25,"And he stationed the Levi'im in the Beis Hashem with cymbals, with nevalim, and with kinnorot, according to the mitzvat Dovid, and of Gad the Chozeh HaMelech and Natan HaNavi; for so was the commandment of Hashem by His Nevi'im."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,29,26,"And the Levi'im stood with the instruments of Dovid, and the Kohanim with the trumpets."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,29,27,"And Chizkiyahu commanded to offer the olah (burnt offering) upon the Mizbe'ach. And when the olah (burnt offering) began, the Shir Hashem began also with the trumpets, and with the instruments ordained by Dovid Melech Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,29,28,"And Kol HaKahal worshiped, and the Shir was being sung, and sounded, and all this continued until the olah was completed."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,29,29,"And when it had made an end of being offered up, HaMelech and all that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshiped."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,29,30,"Moreover Chizkiyahu (Yechizkiyahu) HaMelech and the sarim commanded the Levi'im to praise Hashem with the words of Dovid, and of Asaph the Chozeh (seer) . And they sang praises with simchah, and they bowed their heads and worshiped."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,29,31,"Then Chizkiyahu (Yechizkiyahu) answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto Hashem , come near and bring zevakhim and todot into the Beis Hashem . And the Kahal brought in zevakhim and todot; and, as many as were of a willing heart, olot (burnt offerings)."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,29,32,"And the number of the olah, which the Kahal brought, was threescore and ten bulls, a hundred rams, and two hundred lambs; all these were for an olah (burnt offering) to Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,29,33,And the kadashim were six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,29,34,"But the Kohanim were too few, so that they could not skin all the olot; therefore their achim the Levi'im did help them, until the work was completed, and until the other Kohanim had set them apart as kodesh for the Levi'im were more yashar in lev to set themselves apart as kodesh than the Kohanim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,29,35,"And also the olah were in abundance, with the fat of the shelamim, and the nesakhim for every olah. So the Avodas Beis Hashem was set in order."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,29,36,"And Chizkiyahu (Yechizkiyahu) rejoiced, and kol HaAm, that HaElohim had prepared the people, for the matter was done suddenly."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,30,1,"And Chizkiyahu (Yechizkiyahu) sent to kol Yisroel and Yehudah, and wrote iggerot also to Ephrayim and Menasheh, that they should come to the Beis Hashem at Yerushalayim, to keep the Pesach Hashem Elohei Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,30,2,"For HaMelech had conferred and agreed with his sarim, and kol HaKahal in Yerushalayim, to keep the Pesach in the second month."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,30,3,"For they could not keep it at its time, because the Kohanim had not set themselves apart as kodesh in sufficient numbers, neither had HaAm gathered themselves together to Yerushalayim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,30,4,And the thing pleased HaMelech and kol HaKahal.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,30,5,"So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout kol Yisroel, from Be'er-Sheva even to Dan, that they should come to keep Pesach unto Hashem Elohei Yisroel in Yerushalayim, for not many had kept Pesach as prescribed."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,30,6,"So the runners went with the iggerot from HaMelech and his sarim throughout kol Yisroel and Yehudah, and according to the commandment of HaMelech, saying, Ye Bnei Yisroel, shuvu (turn, return) unto Hashem Elohei Avraham, Yitzchak, and Yisroel, and He will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the yad of the Kings of Assyria."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,30,7,"And be not ye like Avoteichem, and like your achim, which were unfaithful against Hashem Elohei Avoteihem, Who therefore gave them up to a desolation, as ye see."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,30,8,"Now be ye not stiffnecked, as Avoteichem were, but yield yourselves unto Hashem , and come to His Mikdash, which He hath set apart as kodesh l'olam; and serve Hashem Eloheichem, that the fierceness of His wrath may turn away from you."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,30,9,"For if ye turn again unto Hashem , your achim and your banim shall find rachamim before them that lead them captive, so that they shall come back into HaAretz HaZot, for Hashem Eloheichem is channun (gracious) and rachum (compassionate) , and will not turn away His face from you, if ye return unto Him."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,30,10,"So the runners passed from town to town through Eretz Ephrayim and Menasheh even unto Zevulun, but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,30,11,"Nevertheless anashim of Asher and Menasheh and of Zevulun humbled themselves, and went to Yerushalayim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,30,12,"Also in Yehudah the Yad HaElohim was to give them lev echad to carry out the mitzvat HaMelech and of the sarim, by the word of Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,30,13,"And there assembled at Yerushalayim Am Rav (Much People) to keep Chag HaMatzot in the second month, a kahal larov me'od (a very great congregation)."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,30,14,"And they arose and removed the mizbechot that were in Yerushalayim, and all the incense altars they took away, and threw them into the Wadi Kidron."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,30,15,"Then they slaughtered the Pesach on the fourteenth day of the second month; and the Kohanim and the Levi'im were ashamed, and they set themselves apart as kodesh, and brought olot to the Beis Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,30,16,"And they stood in their place after their prescribed manner, according to the Torat Moshe Ish HaElohim; the Kohanim sprinkled the dahm, which they received of the yad of the Levi'im."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,30,17,For there were rabbim in HaKahal that were not set apart as kodesh; therefore the Levi'im had the charge of the shechitah (ritual slaughter) of the Pesachim for every one that was not tahor and therefore could not set them apart as kodesh unto Hashem.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,30,18,"For most of HaAm, even many of Ephrayim, and Menasheh, Yissakhar, and Zevulun, had not made themselves tahor, yet did they eat the Pesach contrary to what was written. But Chizkiyahu (Yechizkiyahu) davened for them, saying, May Hashem Hatov grant kapporah to"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,30,19,"Everyone that prepareth his lev to seek HaElohim, Hashem Elohei Avotav, though he be not tahor according to the taharat HaKodesh."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,30,20,"And Hashem paid heed to Chizkiyahu (Yechizkiyahu), and healed HaAm."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,30,21,"And the Bnei Yisroel that were present at Yerushalayim kept the Chag HaMatzot shivat yamim with simchah gedolah; and the Levi'im and the Kohanim praised Hashem yom b'yom, singing with loud instruments unto Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,30,22,"And Chizkiyahu (Yechizkiyahu) spoke words of comfort unto all the Levi'im who taught the seichel tov of Hashem , and they did eat the mo'ed seven days, offering zivkhei shelamim, and making confession to Hashem Elohei Avoteihem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,30,23,And the kol HaKahal conferred and agreed to celebrate still another shivat yamim; and they kept another shivat yamim with simcha.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,30,24,For Chizkiyahu (Yechizkiyahu) Melech Yehudah did give to the Kahal a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep; and the sarim gave to the Kahal a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep; and a great number of Kohanim set themselves apart as kodesh.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,30,25,"And kol Kehal Yehudah, with the Kohanim and the Levi'im, and kol HaKahal that came out of Yisroel, and the gerim that came out of Eretz Yisroel, and that dwelt in Yehudah, rejoiced."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,30,26,So there was simchah gedolah in Yerushalayim; for since the days of Sh'lomo Ben Dovid Melech Yisroel there was not the like in Yerushalayim.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,30,27,"Then the Kohanim and the Levi'im arose and blessed HaAm, and their voice was heard, and their tefillah came up to His Ma'on Kodesh, even unto Shomayim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,31,1,"Now when all this was completed, kol Yisroel that were present went out to the towns of Yehudah, and smashed the matzevot, and cut down the Asherim, and threw down the high places and the mizbechot throughout kol Yehudah and Binyamin, in Ephrayim also and Menasheh, until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the Bnei Yisroel returned, every ish to his achuzzah, into their own towns."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,31,2,"And Chizkiyahu (Yechizkiyahu) appointed the machlekot of the Kohanim and the Levi'im after their divisions, every ish according to his avodas service, the Kohanim and Levi'im for olah and for shelamim, to minister, to give thanks, to praise in the Sh'arei Machanot Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,31,3,"A gift from HaMelech, from his own possessions, was for the olot, for the boker and erev olot, and the olot for the Shabbatot, and for Rosh Chodesh, and for the Mo'adim, as it is written in the Torat Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,31,4,"Moreover he commanded HaAm that dwelt in Yerushalayim to give the menat HaKohanim v'HaLevi'im (support of the Kohanim and the Levi'im) , that they might strengthen themselves in the Torat Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,31,5,"And as soon as the devar went out, the Bnei Yisroel brought in abundance the reshit of dagan, tirosh, and yitzhar (pure olive oil) , and devash, and of all the increase of the sadeh; and the ma'aser (tithe) of all things they brought in abundantly."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,31,6,"And concerning the Bnei Yisroel and Yehudah, that dwelt in the towns of Yehudah, they also brought in the ma'aser of bakar and tzon, and the ma'aser of kadashim which were hamekudashim (consecrated, set apart as kodesh) unto Hashem Eloheihem, and piled them in heaps."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,31,7,"In the chodesh hashelishi they began to lay foundations for the heaps, and completed them in the chodesh hashevi'i."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,31,8,"And when Chizkiyahu (Yechizkiyahu) and the sarim came and saw the heaps, they blessed Hashem , and His Am Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,31,9,Then Chizkiyahu (Yechizkiyahu) questioned the Kohanim and the Levi'im concerning the heaps.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,31,10,"And Azaryahu HaKohen HaRosh of the Bais Tzadok answered him, and said, Since the people began to bring the terumah into the Beis Hashem , we have had enough to eat, and have plenty to spare, for Hashem hath blessed His people; and that which is notar (left over) is this great amount."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,31,11,"Then Chizkiyahu (Yechizkiyahu) commanded to prepare leshakhot (storerooms) in the Beis Hashem ; and they prepared them,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,31,12,"And brought in the terumah and the ma'aser and the kadashim be'emunah (faithfully) , over which Konanyah the Levi was Nagid, and Shime'i his brother was mishneh (second)."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,31,13,"And Yechiel, and Azazyahu, and Nachat, and Asahel, and Yerimot, and Yozavad, and Eliel, and Yismachyahu, and Machat, and Benayahu, were pekidim (overseers) under the yad Konanyah and Shime'i his brother, by the command of Chizkiyahu (Yechizkiyahu) HaMelech, and Azaryahu the nagid of the Beis HaElohim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,31,14,"And Kore ben Yimnah the Levi, the sho'er (gatekeeper) at the east, was over the nidvot HaElohim (freewill offerings of G-d) , to distribute the terumat Hashem , and the kadshei hakadashim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,31,15,"And next to him be'emunah were Eden, and Minyamin, and Yeshua, and Shema'yahu, Amaryahu, and Shekanyahu, in the towns of the Kohanim, to give to their achim by machlekot, to the gadol as well as the katan."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,31,16,"This was besides those males who were recorded in the genealogical records, from three years old and upward, even unto every one that entereth into the Beis Hashem for its daily duty for their avodas service in their mishmerot (watches, shifts) according to their machlekot,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,31,17,"Both to the genealogy of the Kohanim by the Bais Avoteihem, and the Levi'im from twenty years old and upward, in their mishmerot by their machlekot (divisions);"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,31,18,"And to the genealogy of all their little ones, their nashim, and their banim, and their banot, throughout kol Kahal, for be'emunah (in faithfulness) they set themselves apart as kodesh in kodesh (holiness);"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,31,19,"Also of the Bnei Aharon the Kohanim, which were in the pasture lands of their towns, in each town, the men that were designated by name to give manot to every zachar among the Kohanim, and to all that were reckoned by genealogies among the Levi'im."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,31,20,"And thus did Chizkiyahu (Yechizkiyahu) throughout kol Yehudah, and wrought that which was tov and yashar and emes before Hashem Elohav."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,31,21,"And in every ma'aseh that he began in the Avodas Beis HaElohim, and in the Torah, and in the Mitzvah, to seek Elohav, he did it with all his heart, and prospered."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,32,1,"After these things, and haemes thereof, Sancheriv (Sennacherib) Melech Assyria came, and invaded Yehudah, and laid siege against the fortified cities, and thought to conquer them for himself."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,32,2,"And when Chizkiyahu (Yechizkiyahu) saw that Sancheriv was come, and that he was purposed to make milchamah against Yerushalayim,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,32,3,He took counsel with his sarim and his gibborim to cover over the waters of the springs which were outside the Ir; and they did support him.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,32,4,"So there was gathered Am Rav together, who covered the springs, and the wadi that flowed through the midst of HaAretz, saying, Why should the melachim of Assyria come, and find mayim rabbim?"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,32,5,"Also he strengthened himself, and repaired all the chomah that was broken down, and raised it on the migdalot, and another chomah outside of it, and repaired Millo in Ir Dovid, and made weapons and shields in abundance."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,32,6,"And he appointed sarim milchamot over HaAm, and gathered them together before him in the rechov of the Sha'ar HaIr, and spoke encouragingly to them, saying,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,32,7,"Chizku (be strong) and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed because of the melech Assyria, nor because of all the vast army that is with him, for there be more with us than with him."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,32,8,"With him is zero'a basar, but with us is Hashem Eloheinu to help us, and to fight milchamoteinu (our battles) . And HaAm took heart upon the words of Chizkiyahu (Yechizkiyahu) Melech Yehudah."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,32,9,"After this did Sancheriv melech Assyria send his avadim to Yerushalayim, (but he himself laid siege against Lakhish, with all his forces with him,) unto Chizkiyahu (Yechizkiyahu) Melech Yehudah, and unto kol Yehudah that were in Yerushalayim, saying,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,32,10,"Thus saith Sancheriv melech Assyria, Whereon do ye base confidence, that ye abide in the siege in Yerushalayim?"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,32,11,"Doth not Chizkiyahu (Yechizkiyahu) mislead you to give over yourselves to die by ra'av and by tzama, saying, Hashem Eloheinu shall deliver us out of the yad Melech Assyria?"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,32,12,"Is not this the same Chizkiyah (Yechizkiyahu) that has removed His high places and His mizbechot, and commanded Yehudah and Yerushalayim, saying, Ye shall worship before Mizbe'ach echad, and burn ketoret upon it?"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,32,13,Know ye not what I and avotai have done unto all the people of other lands? Were the elohei goyei ha'aratzot able to deliver their land out of mine yad?
Divrey Hayamim Bais,32,14,"Who was there among kol elohei haGoyim that avotai utterly destroyed, that could save his people out of mine yad, that Eloheichem should be able to save you out of mine yad?"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,32,15,"Now therefore let not Chizkiyahu (Yechizkiyahu) deceive you, nor mislead you on this manner, neither yet believe him, for no g-d of any goy or mamlachah was able to deliver his people out of mine yad, and out of the yad of avotai. How much less shall Eloheichem deliver you out of mine yad?"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,32,16,"And his avadim spoke yet more against Hashem HaElohim, and against His eved Chizkiyahu (Yechizkiyahu)."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,32,17,"He wrote also sefarim to blaspheme Hashem Elohei Yisroel, and to speak against Him, saying, As the elohei goyei ha'aratzot have not saved their people out of mine yad, so shall not the Elohei Chizkiyahu (Yechizkiyahu) save his people out of mine yad."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,32,18,"Then they cried with a kol gadol in the language of the Yehudim unto the Am Yerushalayim that were on the chomah, to frighten them, and to terrorize them, that they might capture the Ir."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,32,19,"And they spoke against the Elohei Yerushalayim, as against the g-ds of the peoples of the land, which were the work of the hands of ha'adam."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,32,20,"And for this cause Chizkiyahu (Yechizkiyahu) HaMelech, and Yeshayahu ben Amotz, HaNavi, davened and cried out to Shomayim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,32,21,"And Hashem sent a malach, which destroyed all the fighting gibborim, and the nagid and sar in the machaneh of the melech Assyria. So he withdrew in boshet panim (shamefaced disgrace) to his own land. And when he was entered the bais elohav, they that came forth of his own loins cut him down there with the cherev."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,32,22,"Thus Hashem saved Chizkiyahu (Yechizkiyahu) and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim from the yad Sancheriv Melech Ashur, and from the yad of all other, and guided them on every side."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,32,23,"And many brought minchah unto Hashem to Yerushalayim, and migdanot (expensive gifts) to Chizkiyahu (Yechizkiyahu) Melech Yehudah, so that he was magnified in the sight of Kol HaGoyim from thenceforth."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,32,24,"In those yamim Chizkiyah (Yechizkiyahu) became ill, to the point of mot, and davened unto Hashem , and He answered him, and He gave him a mofet."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,32,25,"But Chizkiyahu (Yechizkiyahu) did not render back according to the benefit done unto him; for his lev was lifted up in pride; therefore there was ketzef (wrath) upon him, and upon Yehudah and Yerushalayim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,32,26,"Notwithstanding Chizkiyahu (Yechizkiyahu) humbled himself for the pride of his lev, both he and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim, so that the ketzef Hashem came not upon them in the days of Chizkiyah."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,32,27,"And Chizkiyahu (Yechizkiyahu) had exceeding much osher and kavod, and he made himself otzarot for kesef, and for zahav, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for moginim, and for all manner of valuable things;"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,32,28,"Silos also for the increase of dagan, and tirosh and yitzhar (pure olive oil) ; and stalls for the livestock, and pens for all the sheep."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,32,29,"Moreover he built him towns, and possessions of tzon and bakar in abundance, for Elohim had given him wealth very much."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,32,30,This same Chizkiyahu (Yechizkiyahu) also covered over the upper source of the Gichon Spring and tunneled it straight down to the west side of Ir Dovid. Chizkiyahu (Yechizkiyahu) prospered in all his works.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,32,31,"Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the sarim of Babylon, who sent unto him to inquire of the mofet that was done in HaAretz, HaElohim left him, to test him, that He might know all that was in his lev."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,32,32,"Now the rest of the acts of Chizkiyahu (Yechizkiyahu), and his acts of chesed, hinei, they are written in the Chazon Yeshayahu ben Amotz HaNavi, and in the Sefer Melachim of Yehudah and Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,32,33,"And Chizkiyahu (Yechizkiyahu) slept with Avotav, and they buried him on the ascent in kivrei Bnei Dovid; and all Yehudah and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim did him kavod at his mot. And Menasheh bno reigned in his place."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,33,1,"Menasheh was 12 years old when he began to reign, and he reigned 55 years in Yerushalayim,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,33,2,"But did that which was rah in the eyes of Hashem , like unto the to'avot HaGoyim, whom Hashem had driven out before the Bnei Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,33,3,"For he rebuilt the high places which Chizkiyahu (Yechizkiyahu) Aviv had demolished, erected mizbechot for Ba'alim, and made Asherot, and worshiped all the tzva HaShomayim, and served them."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,33,4,"Also he built mizbechot in the Beis Hashem , whereof Hashem had said, In Yerushalayim shall Shmi be forever."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,33,5,And he built mizbechot for all the tzva HaShomayim in the two khatzerot (courtyards) of the Beis Hashem.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,33,6,"And he caused his banot to pass through the eish in the Gey Ben Hinnom; also he practiced astrology, fortune-telling, and witchcraft, and necromancy and consulted mediums and spiritists; he wrought rah in the eyes of Hashem , to provoke Him to anger."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,33,7,"And he set a pesel hasemel which he had made in the Beis HaElohim, of which Elohim had said to Dovid and to Sh'lomo bno, In this Beis, and in Yerushalayim, which I have chosen before all the Shivtei Yisroel, will I put Shmi forever;"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,33,8,"Neither will I anymore remove the regel Yisroel from HaAretz which I have appointed for Avoteichem; so that they will take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to kol HaTorah and the Chukkim and the Mishpatim by the yad Moshe."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,33,9,"So Menasheh made Yehudah and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim to be led astray, and to do rah more than the Goyim, whom Hashem had destroyed before the Bnei Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,33,10,"And Hashem spoke to Menasheh, and to his people, but they would not pay heed."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,33,11,"Therefore Hashem brought upon them the sarei hatzavah of Melech Ashur (Assyria) , which captured Menasheh with a hunterʼs hooks, and bound him with bronze shackles, and hauled him off to Babylon."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,33,12,"And when he was in distress, he besought Hashem Elohav, and humbled himself greatly before Elohei Avotav,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,33,13,"And davened unto Him, and He was entreated of him, and heard his techinnah, and brought him back again to Yerushalayim into his malchut. Then Menasheh knew that Hashem hu HaElohim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,33,14,"Now after this he rebuilt a chomah chitzonah of Ir Dovid, on the west side of Gichon, in the valley, at the approach of Sha'ar HaDagim, and encompassed the Ophel, and raised it up a very great height, and stationed military commanders in all the fortified cities of Yehudah."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,33,15,"And he removed the elohei hanekhar, and the semel (image) from the Beis Hashem , and all the mizbechot that he had built in the har of the Beis Hashem , and in Yerushalayim, and cast them outside the Ir."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,33,16,"And he rebuilt the Mizbe'ach Hashem , and sacrificed thereon zivkhei shelamim and todah, and commanded Yehudah to serve Hashem Elohei Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,33,17,"Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, albeit unto Hashem Eloheihem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,33,18,"Now the rest of the acts of Menasheh, and his tefillah unto Elohav, and the divrei HaChozim that spoke to him b'Shem Hashem Elohei Yisroel, hinei, they are written in the annals of the Melachim of Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,33,19,"His tefillah also, and how He was entreated of him, and all his chattat, and his unfaithfulness, and the mekomot (sites, places) wherein he built high places, and set up Asherim and pesilim, before he was humbled; hinei, they are written among the records of Chozai."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,33,20,"So Menasheh slept with Avotav, and they buried him in his own bais; and Amon bno reigned in his place."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,33,21,"Amon was 22 shanah when he began to reign, and reigned two shanim in Yerushalayim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,33,22,"But he did that which was rah in the eyes of Hashem , as did Menasheh Aviv, for Amon sacrificed unto all the pesilim (idols) which Menasheh Aviv had made, and served them;"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,33,23,"And humbled not himself before Hashem , as Menasheh Aviv had humbled himself; but Amon increased more and more in ashmah."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,33,24,"And his avadim made a kesher against him, assassinated him in his own bais."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,33,25,But the am ha'aretz slaughtered all them that had made the kesher against HaMelech Amon; and the am ha'aretz made Yoshiyahu (Josiah) bno Melech in his place.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,34,1,"Yoshiyahu was 8 years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Yerushalayim 31 shanah."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,34,2,"And he did that which was yashar in the eyes of Hashem , and walked in the ways of Dovid Aviv, and veered off neither right nor left."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,34,3,"For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet na'ar (young) , he began to seek after Elohei Dovid Aviv; and in the twelfth year he began to make tahor Yehudah and Yerushalayim from the high places, and the Asherim, and the pesilim, and the massekhot (molten images)."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,34,4,"And they demolished the mizbechot of Ba'alim in his presence; and the incense stands erected above them he smashed; and the Asherim, and the pesilim, and the massekhot he demolished and made dust of them, and scattered upon the keverim (graves) of them that had sacrificed unto them."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,34,5,"And he burned the atzmot of the Kohanim upon their mizbechot, and made tahor Yehudah and Yerushalayim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,34,6,"And so did he in the towns of Menasheh, and Ephrayim, and Shim'on, even as far as Naphtali, and in their ruins all around."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,34,7,"And when he had broken down the mizbechot and the Asherim, and had beaten the pesilim into powder, and cut down all the incense stands throughout all Eretz Yisroel, he returned to Yerushalayim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,34,8,"Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had made tahor HaAretz, and HaBeis, he sent Shaphan ben Atzalyahu, and Ma'aseiyahu the Sar HaIr, and Yoach ben Yo'achaz the recorder, to repair the Beis Hashem Elohav."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,34,9,"And when they came to Chilkiyahu the Kohen HaGadol, they delivered the kesef that was brought into the Beis Elohim, which the Levi'im, the Shomrei HaSaf (the Doorkeepers) , had collected from the people of Menasheh and Ephrayim, and from kol She'erit Yisroel, and kol Yehudah and Binyamin, and they returned to Yerushalayim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,34,10,"And they entrusted it into the yad oseh hamelachah (hand of the master workmen) that had hamufkadim (oversight) of the Beis Hashem , and they paid it to the workmen that wrought in the Beis Hashem , to repair and restore HaBeis;"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,34,11,"Even to the charashim (craftsmen, artisans) and builders gave they it, to buy quarried stones, and timber for rafters and beams, for the buildings which the Melachim of Yehudah had destroyed."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,34,12,"And the men did the melachah (work) be'emunah (faithfully, with integrity) ; and the mufkadim (overseers) of them were Yachat and Ovadyahu, the Levi'im, of the Bnei Merari; and Zecharyah and Meshullam, of the Bnei Kehati, to give oversight; and other of the Levi'im, all that were meiven (expert) in musical instruments."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,34,13,"Also they were over the sabalim (bearers of burdens) and the overseers of all that wrought the work in every kind of avodah; and of the Levi'im there were soferim (scribes) , shoterim (officers) and sho'arim (doorkeepers)."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,34,14,"And when they brought out the kesef that was brought into the Beis Hashem , Chilkiyahu HaKohen found a Sefer Torat Hashem given through Moshe."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,34,15,"And Chilkiyahu answered and said to Shaphan the Sofer, I have found the Sefer HaTorah in the Beis Hashem . And Chilkiyahu delivered the Sefer to Shaphan."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,34,16,"And Shaphan carried the Sefer to HaMelech, and brought HaMelech word back again, saying, All that was committed into the yad of avadim, they are doing."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,34,17,"And they have emptied out the kesef that was found in the Beis Hashem , and have entrusted it into the yad hamufkadim and to the yad osei hamelachah."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,34,18,"Then Shaphan the Sofer told HaMelech, saying, Chilkiyahu HaKohen hath given me a Sefer. And Shaphan read it in the presence of HaMelech."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,34,19,"And it came to pass, when HaMelech had heard the divrei HaTorah, that he tore his garments."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,34,20,"And HaMelech commanded Chilkiyahu, and Achikam ben Shaphan, and Avdon ben Michah, and Shaphan HaSofer, and Asayah eved HaMelech, saying,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,34,21,"Go, inquire of Hashem for me, and for them that are nishar (left, remaining, the remnant) in Yisroel and in Yehudah, concerning the divrei hasefer that is found; for gadolah chamat Hashem is poured out upon us, because Avoteinu have not been shomer over the Devar Hashem , to do after all that is written in HaSefer Hazeh."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,34,22,"And Chilkiyahu, and they that HaMelech had sent, went to Chuldah the neviah, the wife of Shallum ben Tokehat ben Chasrah, Shomer HaBegadim (Keeper of the Wardrobe) , (now she dwelt in Yerushalayim in the Mishneh), and they spoke to her to this effect."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,34,23,"And she answered them, Thus saith Hashem Elohei Yisroel, Tell ye the ish that sent you to me,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,34,24,"Thus saith Hashem , Hinei, I will bring ra'ah upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the alot (curses) that are written in the Sefer which they have read in the presence of Melech Yehudah,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,34,25,"Because they have forsaken Me, and have burned ketoret unto elohim acherim, that they might provoke Me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore My wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,34,26,"And as for Melech Yehudah, who sent you to inquire of Hashem , so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith Hashem Elohei Yisroel concerning the words which thou hast heard;"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,34,27,"Because thine lev was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before Elohim, when thou heardest His words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before Me, and didst tear thy garments, and weep in My Presence, I have even heard thee also, saith Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,34,28,"Hinei, I will gather thee to Avoteicha, thou shalt be gathered to thy kever in shalom, neither shall thine eyes see all ra'ah I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of it. So they brought back HaMelech word."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,34,29,Then HaMelech sent and gathered together all the Ziknei Yehudah and Yerushalayim.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,34,30,"And HaMelech went up to the Beis Hashem , and kol Ish Yehudah, and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim, and the Kohanim, and the Levi'im, and kol haAm, gadol and katan; and he read in their ears kol divrei Sefer HaBrit that was found in the Beis Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,34,31,"And HaMelech stood at his place, and cut HaBrit in the presence of Hashem , to walk after Hashem , and to be shomer over His mitzvot, and His testimonies, and His chukkot, with all his lev, and with all his nefesh, to perform the divrei HaBrit which are written in Sefer HaZeh."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,34,32,"And he caused all that being found in Yerushalayim and Binyamin to make a pledge to it. And the inhabitants of Yerushalayim did according to the Brit Elohim, Elohei Avoteihem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,34,33,"And Yoshiyah removed kol hato'evot out of all the territories that pertained to the Bnei Yisroel, and made all that were present in Yisroel to do avodas service to Hashem Eloheihem. And all his days they veered not from following Hashem , Elohei Avoteihem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,35,1,"Moreover Yoshiyahu kept Pesach unto Hashem in Yerushalayim, and they slaughtered the Pesach on the fourteenth day of the first month."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,35,2,"And he set up the Kohanim in their mishmerot, and encouraged them to the Avodas Beis Hashem,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,35,3,"And said unto the Levi'im that taught kol Yisroel, which were hakedoshim unto Hashem , Put the Aron HaKodesh in the Beis which Sh'lomo Ben Dovid Melech Yisroel did build; it shall not be a massa (burden, something carried) upon your ketefayim (shoulders) ; serve now Hashem Eloheichem and His people Yisroel,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,35,4,"And prepare yourselves by Bais Avoteichem, after your machlekot, according to the writing of Dovid Melech Yisroel, and according to the mikhtav of Sh'lomo bno."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,35,5,"And stand in HaKodesh according to the pelugot Bais HaAvot (groupings of families) of your achim the Bnei HaAm, and after the chalukat Bais Av (family subdivisions) of the Levi'im."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,35,6,"So slaughter the Pesach, and set yourselves apart as kodesh, and prepare your achim, that they may do according to the Devar Hashem by the yad Moshe."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,35,7,"And Yoshiyahu gave to HaAm, of the tzon, kevasim and goats, all for the Pesachim, for all that were present, to the number of 30,000 plus 3,000 bakar; these were from the property of HaMelech."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,35,8,"And his sarim gave linedavah (voluntarily) unto HaAm, to the Kohanim, to the Levi'im. Chilkiyah, Zecharyahu, Yechiel, negidei Beis HaElohim, gave unto the Kohanim for the Pesachim 2,600 and 300 bakar."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,35,9,"Konanyah also, and Shema'yahu and Netanel, his achim, and Chashavyahu and Ye'iel and Yozavad, Sarei HaLevi'im, gave unto the Levi'im for Pesachim 5,000 and 500 bakar."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,35,10,"So the Avodah (Service) was prepared, and the Kohanim stood in their place, and the Levi'im in their machlekot, according to the mitzvat HaMelech."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,35,11,"And they slaughtered the Pesach, and the Kohanim sprinkled the dahm from their hands, and the Levi'im skinned them."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,35,12,"And they removed the olah, that they might give according to the pelugot l'Bais Avot l'Bnei HaAm, to offer unto Hashem , as it is written in the Sefer Moshe. And so did they with the bakar."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,35,13,"And they roasted the Pesach with eish according to the mishpat; but the other kadashim they boiled in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and distributed them in haste among kol Bnei HaAm."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,35,14,"And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the Kohanim; because the Kohanim the Bnei Aharon were busied in offering olah and the chalavim (fats) until lailah; therefore the Levi'im prepared for themselves, and for the Kohanim, the Bnei Aharon."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,35,15,"And the meshorarim (singers) , the Bnei Asaph, were in their place, according to the mitzvat Dovid, and Asaph, and Heman, and Yedutun, Chozeh HaMelech; and the sho'arim (gatekeepers) were at every sha'ar; neither did they need to depart from their Avodah, for their achim the Levi'im prepared for them."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,35,16,"So all the Avodas Hashem was prepared that same day, to keep the Pesach, and to offer olot upon the Mizbe'ach Hashem , according to the mitzvat HaMelech Yoshiyahu."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,35,17,"And the Bnei Yisroel that were present kept the Pesach at that time, and the Chag HaMatzot seven days."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,35,18,"And there was no Pesach like it in Yisroel from the days of Shmuel HaNavi; neither did all the Melachim of Yisroel keep such a Pesach as Yoshiyahu kept, and the Kohanim, and the Levi'im, and kol Yehudah and Yisroel that were present, and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,35,19,In the eighteenth shanah of the reign of Yoshiyahu was this Pesach kept.
Divrey Hayamim Bais,35,20,"After all this, when Yoshiyahu had set in order the Beis, Nekho Melech Mitzrayim went up to fight at Karkemish on the Euphrates, and Yoshiyahu went up against him."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,35,21,"But he sent malachim to him, saying, Mah li valach (What have I to do with thee) , thou Melech Yehudah? I come not against thee this day, but against the Bais wherewith I have war, for Elohim commanded me to make haste; forbear thee from meddling with Elohim, Who is with me, that He destroy thee not."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,35,22,"Nevertheless Yoshiyahu would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and paid heed not unto the words of Nekho from the mouth of Elohim, and went to fight in the Valley of Megiddo."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,35,23,"And the archers shot at Melech Yoshiyahu; and HaMelech said to his avadim, Take me away; for I am badly wounded."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,35,24,"His avadim therefore took him out of that merkavah, and put him in the mishneh merkavah that he had; and they brought him to Yerushalayim, and he died, and was buried in the kivrot Avotav. And all Yehudah and Yerushalayim mourned for Yoshiyahu."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,35,25,"And Yirmeyahu lamented for Yoshiyahu; and all the sharim (singing men) and the sharot (singing women) commemorate Yoshiyahu in their laments to this day, and made them as chok in Yisroel; and, hinei, they are written in HaKinot (the Laments)."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,35,26,"Now the rest of the acts of Yoshiyahu, and his acts of chesed, according to what is written in the Torat Hashem,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,35,27,"And his deeds, harishonim and ha'acharonim, hinei, they are written in the Sefer of the Melachim of Yisroel and Yehudah."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,36,1,"Then the Am Ha'Aretz took Yehoachaz ben Yoshiyahu, and made him melech in the place of Aviv in Yerushalayim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,36,2,"Yehoachaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Yerushalayim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,36,3,"And Melech Mitzrayim deposed him at Yerushalayim, and laid on HaAretz a tribute of a hundred talents of kesef and a talent of zahav."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,36,4,"And Melech Mitzrayim made Elyakim his brother melech over Yehudah and Yerushalayim, and changed shmo to Y'hoyakim. And Nekho took Yehoachaz his brother, and carried him off to Mitzrayim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,36,5,"Y'hoyakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Yerushalayim; and he did that which was rah in the eyes of Hashem Elohav."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,36,6,"Against him came up Nevukhadnetzar Melech Bavel, and bound him in bronze shackles, to carry him off to Babylon."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,36,7,"Nevukhadnetzar also carried off the vessels of the Beis Hashem to Babylon, and put them in his heikhal (temple) at Babylon."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,36,8,"Now the rest of the acts of Y'hoyakim, and his to'avot which he did, and that which was found in him, hinei, they are written in the Sefer of the Melachim of Yisroel and Yehudah; and Y'hoyakhin bno became king in his place."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,36,9,"Y'hoyakhin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days in Yerushalayim; and he did that which was rah in the eyes of Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,36,10,"And when the year was expired, HaMelech Nevukhadnetzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the kelei chemdat Beis Hashem , and made Tzidkiyahu his brother Melech over Yehudah and Yerushalayim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,36,11,"Tzidkiyah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned eleven years in Yerushalayim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,36,12,"And he did that which was rah in the eyes of Hashem Elohav, and humbled not himself before Yirmeyahu HaNavi speaking from the mouth of Hashem."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,36,13,"And he also rebelled against Melech Nevukhadnetzar, who had made him take an oath by Elohim, but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his lev against making teshuva unto Hashem Elohei Yisroel."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,36,14,"Moreover all the Sarei HaKohanim, and HaAm became more unfaithful, following all the to'avot HaGoyim, and they made the Beis Hashem tameh which Hashem had consecrated and set apart as kodesh in Yerushalayim."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,36,15,"And Hashem Elohei Avoteihem sent to them by His malachim, time and again; because He took pity on His people and on His Ma'on (Dwelling Place);"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,36,16,"But they mocked the malachim of Elohim, and despised His words, and derided His nevi'im, until the Chamat Hashem was aroused against His people, until there was no marpeh (remedy, healing)."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,36,17,"Therefore He brought upon them Melech Kasdim, who slaughtered their bochurim with the cherev in their Beis Mikdash, and had no pity upon bochur or betulah, zaken or the aged man. He gave them all into his yad."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,36,18,"And all the kelei Beis HaElohim, hagedolim and haketanim, and the otzerot of the Beis Hashem , and the otzerot HaMelech, and of his sarim; all these he brought to Babylon."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,36,19,"And they burned the Beis HaElohim, and broke down the Chomat Yerushalayim, and burned all the palaces thereof with eish, and destroyed all its precious vessels."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,36,20,And them that had escaped from the cherev carried he off to Babylon where they were avadim to him and his banim until the kingdom of Paras (Persia) began to reign;
Divrey Hayamim Bais,36,21,"To fulfil the Devar Hashem by the mouth of Yirmeyahu, until HaAretz had made up for its Shabbatot, for as long as she lay desolate she was shomer Shabbos, to fulfil Shivim Shanah (seventy years)."
Divrey Hayamim Bais,36,22,"Now in the first year of Koresh (Cyrus) Melech Paras (Persia) , that the word of Hashem spoken by the mouth of Yirmeyahu (Jeremiah) might be accomplished, Hashem stirred up the ruach of Koresh Melech Paras (Persia) , that he made a proclamation throughout all his Malchut, and put it also in writing, saying,"
Divrey Hayamim Bais,36,23,"Thus saith Koresh Melech Paras (Persia) , Kol Mamlechot HaAretz (all the kingdoms of the earth) hath Hashem Elohei HaShomayim given me; and He hath charged me to build Him a Beis in Yerushalayim, which is in Yehudah. Who is there among you of all His people? Hashem Elohav be with him and let him go up!"
